abstract: monoclonal antibody 25b 1 generated against diisopropyl  xxxd3217xxx  inhibited fetal

bovine serum acetylcholinesterase has been extensively characterized with respect to its anticholinesterase
properties. this antibody demonstrated considerably different properties from previously reported inhibitory
antibodies raised against acetylcholinesterase in terms of the degree of inhibition (>98%), the high degree
of specificity, and the stability of the antigen-antibody complex. monoclonal antibody 25b 1 appears to
be directed against a conformational epitope located in close proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme
and was found to be most suitable for studying the stabilization of the active site of acetylcholinesterase
against denaturation by heat or guanidine following phosphorylation by organophosphorus anticholinesterase
compounds. this approach allowed the determination of stability rank order of various phosphorylated
acetylcholinesterases. among all the organophosphates tested, the combination of a methyl group and a
negatively charged oxygen attached to the p atom, ch,p(o)(o-)-ache, conferred the greatest protection
to the active site of aged or nonaged organophosphoryl conjugates of acetylcholinesterase.

r o t e i n domains which constitute the active site region(s)
of both ache' ( xxxg38xxx ) and  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) have been
demonstrated to be conformationally less stable than other
segments of the protein (ahmad, 1981; masson & goasdoue,
1986; wu et al., 1987). ahmad (1981) and wu et al. (1987)
demonstrated that environmental perturbants (urea, gdn, ph,
temperature) caused complete loss of enzyme activity of
various forms of ache (g2, g4, ai2) from either eel or
torpedo californica faster than changes observed in the secondary structure of the enzymes. studies by masson and
goasdoue (1 986) revealed that although enzyme activity of
both normal and atypical human plasma  xxxg248xxx  was completely
lost at 2.9 and 1.5 m urea, respectively, only 15-35% of protein
unfolding occurred. high sensitivity of both ache and  xxxg248xxx 
enzymic activities to various environmental changes implies
that ligands directed at sites involved in the catalytic machinery
of the enzyme affect the denaturation process. indeed, reversible inhibitors of ache and  xxxg248xxx  (e.g.,  xxxd1968xxx ,
 xxxd1820xxx , procainamide) conferred significant protection against thermal inactivation of both enzymes, with rank
order parallel to that observed for inhibition of enzyme activity
by the same inhibitors (payne et al., 1989).
previous studies have used cd and uv absorption spectroscopies to characterize changes in the secondary structure
of ache following its exposure to environmental perturbants
(ahmad, 1981; wu et al., 1987). use of fluorescent o p
ligands in conjunction with c d spectroscopy has also found
successful application in studying differences in conformational
stability between aged (nonreactivatable) and nonaged opcht conjugates (steinberg et al., 1988). a second method of
utilizing changes in protein mobility, transverse urea gradient
electrophoresis, has been reported by masson and goasdoue
'a preliminary communication of this report was presented at the
1988 faseb meetings, las vegas, nv (ashani et al., 1988).

(1986) to detect enhanced resistance to protein unfolding in
aged op- xxxg248xxx  conjugates.
the present study was undertaken to explore the use of a
specific mab for studying active site domain(s) of fbs-ache
and to elucidate by means of antigen-antibody binding measurements the extent to which various o p conjugates can
increase resistance of the enzyme to denaturation. in this
report we present results obtained by using a monoclonal
antibody raised against dfp-inhibited fbs-ache. this mab
appears to be directed against a conformational epitope near
the active site of native and op-inhibited enzyme. phosphorylation of ache by six o p ligands slightly but definitely
lowered affinity of the mab for the op-ache conjugate
compared to native enzyme. thermal and chemical perturbation of enzyme activity decreased binding of mab 25b1,
which could be correlated with decrease in activity of the
perturbed enzyme. this mab was found to be most suitable
for studying regional changes near the active site of native and
phosphorylated aches following exposure to external perturbants. evidence is provided by antibody-antigen binding
experiments that the aged conjugate e-op(o)(o-)ch, constitutes the most stable form among either native or several
op-inhibited aches toward various denaturing factors.

respectively.
fbs-ache (1 is) was purified by affinity chromatography
as described by de la hoz et al. (1986). specific activity of
fbs-ache was 400 f 15 units/nmol of active site, with 1
mg of pure enzyme containing approximately 5600 units.

of plasmacytoma cells (p3x63ag8.653; kearney et al., 1979)
with spleen cells from mice immunized with dfp-fbs-ache.
the details of the fusion technique have been previously

solutions of mab 25b1 (0.1-15 pm) were prepared in 50 mm
phosphate (ph 8.0) and diluted at time zero into fbs-ache
solution (1-1 00 nm active site) in 2-50 mm phosphate buffer
containing 0.01% bsa (ph 8.0). at selected time intervals
5-50 pl of sample was diluted (either directly or via intermediate dilution) into 3.2 ml of ellman assay mixture for
measurements of residual enzyme activity. data for the time
course of inhibition reactions were analyzed with a computer-assisted marquardt nonlinear regression analysis using the

3.2 ml of ellman assay mixture. sds-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions was performed
on a minigel (0.75"
width) as described by laemmeli
(1970).
titration of ache. titration of fbs-ache was performed
by monitoring residual activity of ache solution (5-100 nm
active site) incubated with increasing concentrations of either
paraoxon, mepq, or mab 25b1 over a range of 0.1-1.2 times
the number of equivalents of enzyme in solution. inhibition
of ache by paraoxon and mab 25b1 was carried out for
20-24 h; for mepq, incubation time was 30-60 min.
preparation of op-ache conjugates. the following
procedures were employed to obtain op-ache conjugates:
(a) ch,p(o)(o-)-ache, (c,h,o)p(o)(o-)-ache, and
(c,h,o),p(o)-ache were obtained by dropwise addition
(over a period of 10 min) of a fresh concentrated solution (0.01
m in acetonitrile) of either ch,p(o)ci,, (c,h,o)p(o)cl,,
or (c,h,o),p(o)cl, respectively, to a solution of fbs-ache
(approximately 1 p m in 50 mm phosphate, ph 8.0) with
stirring at room temperature. decrease in enzymatic activity
was monitored until 95-98% of the initial enzyme activity was
inhibited. organic solvent in the final inhibition medium did
not exceed 2%.
(b) ch,p(o)(o-)-ache, ch,p(o)(oc,h,)-ache,
(c2h50),p(0)-ache, and (ipro),p(o)-ache were obtained by incubating approximately 1 pm ache solution with
a slightly substoichiometric amount of soman, mepq, paraoxon, and dfp, respectively. decrease in enzyme activity
indicated that 94-98% inhibition was achieved. an 87% aged
form of (ipro)p(o)(o-)-ache was obtained by incubating
(ipro),p(o)-ache at ph 5.0 for 24 h at 25 "c.
none of the op-aches contained residual o p inhibitors
as evidenced by monitoring the activity of ache freshly added
to the phosphorylated enzyme preparations. aging was determined by measuring increase in enzymic activity after 16-h
incubation with 1 mm tmb4 (50 mm phosphate, ph 8.0, 25
"c). all op-ache conjugates were diluted 20- to 200-fold
into 50 mm phosphate buffer for further experiments.
[,h]dfp radiolabeling of free and mab-bound ache.
one micromolar ache and 0.7 pm mab 25b1 or 2 pm mab
ae-2 were incubated for 16 h at 25 "c followed by addition
of 1.5 pm [,h]dfp (3.5 ci/mmol). after 24 h at 25 "c, the
amount of [,h]dfp bound to free or antibody-complexed
ache was determined by gel filtration on a bio-rad p-6
column and measurement of radioactivity in the void volume
(front peak) relative to the total eluted radioactivity (eluent:
50 mm tris, ph 9.0). displacement of radioactivity from
protein-bound [,h]dfp at either ph 5.0 (aging-induced reaction) or in the presence of 1 mm tbm4 at ph 8.0 (reactivation-induced experiments) was also carried out by gel
filtration as described above.
fluorescence spectroscopy. fluorescence spectroscopy
measurements were performed in 5 mm phosphate (ph 8.0)
containing 2-3 pm ache and 1-2 pm  xxxd3027xxx .
dissociation of  xxxd3027xxx  from ache was initiated by addition of 1-2 pm mab 25b1 to the  xxxd3027xxx -ache mixture.
release of the fluorescent chromophore 7-hq from mepq
was monitored in 5 mm phosphate, ph 8.0 (levy & ashani,
1986).
affinity measurements of mab 25bi f o r op-ache.
relative affinity of mab 25b1 for op-modified fbs-ache
was determined by measuring the effect of op-ache
(0.01-0.03 pm) on the inhibition of an equimolar concentration of native ache by 0.005-0.01 5 pm mab 25b1. the
control contained native enzyme and half the concentration

of mab 25b1 used for inhibition of the phosphorylated/native
enzyme mixture. the extent of inhibition of ache in the
presence and absence of op-ache was used to calculate the
affinity of mab 25b1 for op-ache relative to native ache.
heat- and gdn-hcl-induced denaturation of ache.
thermal denaturation of ache was carried out in a shaking
water bath a t either 50 or 54 f 1 oc in 50 m m phosphate
(ph 8.0). to correlate residual activity of denatured ache
with inhibition induced by mab 25b1, samples were cooled
to room temperature (20-25 "c) a t various time intervals,
assayed for enzyme activity, and incubated with a fixed
amount of mab 25b1 sufficient to inhibit 20-35% of preexperimental enzyme activity. samples were allowed to incubate
for 20 h a t 25 oc, followed by measurement of residual activity.
loss of binding of heat-treated op-ache to mab 25b1
was determined by measuring unbound mab 25b1 after 20
h of incubation of thermally treated op-ache with a substoichiometric amount of mab 25b1. unreacted mab 25b1
was determined by adding a slight excess of fresh fbs-ache
to the op-ache/mab 25b1 mixture and measuring enzyme
activity after 20-h incubation at 25 "c.
the extent of loss of ache activity upon denaturation with
gdn.hc1 was determined as follows: native or phosphorylated
ache was incubated a t 25 oc in gdn-hc1 solutions over a
concentration range of 0-2 m in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph
7.4-7.6). the samples were diluted 10-fold into 50 m m
phosphate buffer (ph 8.0), and enzyme activity was measured
as described above, by further diluting 5-50 p l into ellman
assay mixture. loss of binding of mab 25b1 to gdn.hc1induced denaturation of either native or op-ache was carried
out in gdn.hcl/enzyme diluted mixture, as described above
for heat-denatured enzyme. all denaturation experiments were
carried out concurrently with controls not subjected to denaturation.

effect of time on restoration of ache activity following
dilution of mabache complex. mabache conjugate was prepared
by incubation at 25 oc for 20 h and diluted 1000-fold in 50 mm
phosphate, ph 8.0,25 "c. at specified time intervals, 50-pl aliquots
were withdrawn for assay: ( 0 )ae-2.ache, final concentrations of

m for 25b1 and ache, respectively: (0)ache;
( 0 ) 25blqache.
figure 2:

ache = ale-klf+ a2e-kz'),as illustrated in figure 1. corresponding rate constants are referred to as average fast (k,)
and average slow (k,) inhibition rate constants. these rate
constants reflect a continuous decrease in the rate of inhibition
of enzyme activity by 25b1 and are not claimed to represent
two different populations of fbs-ache. when k, and k2 were
plotted against the concentration of mab 25b1 (mab:ache
> lo), straight lines were obtained, and the following bimolecular rate constants for the inhibition of fbs-ache by 25b1
were calculated from the corresponding slopes (50 m m
phosphate, ph 8.0; 25 "c): kfast= 1.25 x lo7 m-' min-l (9
= 0.931) and k,,,, = 0.07 x lo7 m-' min-' (rz = 0.956).
the nonhomogeneous inhibition profile (i.e., deviation from
linearity for first-order plots) for the inactivation of fbs-ache
by mab 25b1 was found to be associated with an increase in
the size of enzymatically active complex formed between
ache and mab 25b1. sucrose density gradient centrifugation profiles (not shown) revealed that when an amount of
25b 1 sufficient to produce approximately 50% inhibition of
the catalytic activity was added, more than 90% of the residual
activity was bound to multiple molecular complexes heavier
than unbound ache. increasing the ratio mab:ache was
associated with an increase in the size of the enzymatically
active complexes. antibody 25b1 displayed high specificity
and variable affinity toward aches from various bovine
sources (e.g., brain, erythrocytes) but neither cross-reacted with
nor inhibited ache isolated from eel, t. californica (both g4),
human erythrocytes (g,), or human serum  xxxg248xxx  (g4).
dissociation of the mab-ache complex. when 25b1ache complex was diluted extensively into buffer solutions
(5-50 m m phosphate, ph 6-9) containing a wide range of
nacl concentration (0.01-2 n), no regeneration of enzyme
activity could be detected for several hours a t 25 oc, even a t
a concentration as low as
m of the diluted complex.
stability was independent of the time of incubation or
mab:ache ratio. residual enzyme activity (68%) in the
supernatant was not changed after high-speed centrifugation
( 1 50000g, 2 h) of the mab-ache complex, ruling out aggregation as a possible explanation for the apparent stability
of the complex. the effect of time on restoration of ache
activity in the absence or presence of acetylthiocholine is shown

in figure 2. acetylthiocholine did not regenerate enzyme
activity from mab 25b1, nor did specific-site cationic ligands
such as 2-pam, tmb4,  xxxd3027xxx , and  xxxd1968xxx  (not
shown). in contrast, mab ae2 (fambrough et al., 1982)
raised against human erythrocyte ache, which inhibited
fbs-ache, appeared to dissociate from the enzyme-antibody
complex, as suggested by the restoration of enzyme activity
(figure 2).
in view of the stability of the 25bl-ache complex, the
possibility that a covalent bond might be involved in the
formation of the conjugate was tested. nonreducing sdspage patterns showed a dissociation of the mab-enzyme
complex, as evidenced by bands at molecular weights corresponding to mab (1 50000) and fbs-ache (dimer, 140000).
in addition, an 80% restoration of enzyme activity could be
demonstrated by transferring a completely inhibited mab.
ache from 50 mm phosphate (ph 8.0) to 1.o m gdn-hc1
solution (ph 7.5). regeneration of enzyme activity was independent of the time of incubation of mab 25b1 with
fbs-ache prior to dilution into gdn.hc1. sucrose density
gradient centrifugation in 1 .o m gdn-hc1 for 17 h at 20 "c
(24 000 rpm) clearly demonstrated that regeneration of enzyme
activity was accompanied with dissociation of mab.ache,
while no such dissociation was observed at 1 m nacl (not
shown).
stoichiometry of inhibition of fbs-ache by mab 25bl.
the stoichiometry of inhibition of fbs-ache by mab 25b1
was determined by measuring the amount of mab 25b1 required to inhibit nearly 100% of enzyme activity. when enzyme was treated with increasing concentrations of either
mepq or paraoxon and the residual activity determined after
completion of reaction, similar titration curves were obtained
for both inhibitors. however, the molar concentration of mab
25b1 required for approximately 100% inhibition of enzyme
activity was half the concentration required for complete inhibition by the ops mepq or paraoxon, suggesting that 1
molecule of mab inactivated approximately 2 active sites of
fbs-ache. by use of four preparations of mab 25b1 it was
calculated that the >98%-inhibited mab.ache complex
contained an average of 2.2 f 0.2 active site molecules of
bound ache per molecule of mab.2
effect of cationic ligands on the kinetics of ache inhibition by mab 25bl. since ache has a high affinity for
certain positively charged ligands, the rate of inhibition of
fbs-ache activity by mab 25b1 was determined in the

presence of  xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx , previously demonstrated to bind at the active site (wilson & quan, 1958; taylor
& lappi, 1975) and at the peripheral anionic site (taylor &
lappi, 1975) of ache, respectively. analysis of enzyme
velocity data using a hofstee plot (data not shown) revealed
a competitive-type inhibition for  xxxd1968xxx  and a noncompetitive inhibition for  xxxd3027xxx . the dissociation constants for  xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  with respect to
75%-inhibited mab-ache conjugate were similar to those for
the free enzyme (table i), indicating that antibody-bound
residual activity exhibited the same properties as unbound
fbs-ache, as far as binding of cationic ligands was concerned. this was consistent with the observation that k,,, for
acetylthiocholine was independent of the degree of enzyme
inhibition by mab 25b1 (table i).
in the presence of  xxxd3027xxx , however, at a concentration
equal to 10-fold its dissociation constant, inhibition of fbsache by mab 25b1 occurred at rates 4- to 7-fold slower than
in the absence of  xxxd3027xxx  (table i), and the extent to which
 xxxd3027xxx  retarded the inhibition of ache by 25b1 could be
correlated with the concentration of this peripheral site cationic
ligand.  xxxd1968xxx  neither affected the time course of
inhibition of ache by mab 25b1 nor interfered with  xxxd3027xxx -induced retardation of enzyme inhibition by 25b1. to
further test the possibility that  xxxd3027xxx  binds at or near a
region which constitutes the epitope for mab 25b1, the displacement of  xxxd3027xxx  from its conjugate with fbs-ache
was monitored in the presence of mab 25b1. on the basis
of changes observed in the excitation and emission spectra of
ache-bound  xxxd3027xxx , a nearly complete dissociation of
 xxxd3027xxx  could be demonstrated following the addition of
stoichiometrically sufficient 25b1 (figure 3). brimijoin et
al. (1985) reported similar results for a monoclonal antibody
raised against rabbit brain ache.
 xxxd1968xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  did not change the stoichiometry observed for the inhibition of ache by mab 25b1.
the affinity of both  xxxd3027xxx  (k,) and mab 25b1 ( k , and
k2) for fbs-ache increased in low ionic strength, while inhibition of ache by  xxxd1968xxx  ( k i )was considerably less
sensitive to changes in ionic strength over the range studied
(table i).
effect of mab 25bl on the phosphorylation of ache and
on reactivation and aging of the corresponding op-ache

figure 3: displacement of  xxxd3027xxx  from ache by mab 25b1 as shown by changes in the fluorescence properties of ache-bound  xxxd3027xxx 
(i). mab 25b1 (1.6 pm) was added to a mixture of 2.3 pm ache and 1.4 pm  xxxd3027xxx  (i). the spectra recorded 30 min later (11) show
that the fluorescence intensity was reduced to the level observed for  xxxd3027xxx  + mab 25b1 (111) or  xxxd3027xxx  alone (iv). all measurements
were carried out in 5 mm phosphate (ph 8.0. 25 " c ) . panel a: excitation spectrum (ae,,, = 625 nm). panel b: emission spectrum (a,
= 516 nm).

mab-inhibited ache was approximately half that obtained
for either free enzyme or ae-2.ache. these results are
similar to previous reports by brimijoin et al. (1985) showing
that mab raised against rabbit brain ache reduced the labeling of the enzyme by [3h]dfp, whereas sorensen et al.
( 1 987) demonstrated that mab ae-2 could not prevent the
labeling of human erythrocyte ache by [3h]dfp.
to further determine the decrease in the nucleophilicity of
ache following complexation with mab 25b1, the release
of fluorescence leaving group 7-hq from mepq was monitored in the presence or absence of either ache or mab.
ache. 7-hq was quantitatively released within 10 s following
the addition of 0.16 p m mepq to 0.1 p m ache. the same
amount of ache preincubated 20 h with 0.19 p m mab 25b1
released the same amount of 7-hq with a half-time of approximately 120 min. fab-ache complex displayed a similar
time course as observed for the release of mepq by mab25b1.
to determine the ability of oximes to reactivate mab-opache conjugate, it was necessary to dissociate reactivated
enzyme from its complex with mab 25b1, since the latter is
enzymatically inactive. op-ache conjugates (0.084.7 pm)
obtained with paraxon, dfp, or mepq were prepared with
a slight stoichiometric excess of mab 25b1 prior to the addition of 1 mm of either 2-pam or tmb,. at various time
intervals, the reactivation mixture was diluted 100-fold into
1.o m gdwhci solution to dissociate the mab.ache complex
and restore the enzyme activity. in a control experiment the
presence of 0.01 m m oxime reactivator (either 2-pam or
tmb4) in 1 .o m gdnehc1 did not significantly reactivate the
op-ache conjugates tested. results indicate that mab 25b1
decreased the rate of reactivation of various op-inhibited
aches by either 2-pam or tmb, but did not prevent approach of the oxime nucleophile to the phosphorus atom a t
the active site, since the oxime-induced reactivation of
mab-op-ache was significantly higher than the reactivation
without the oximes and only 2-10 times less susceptible to
reactivation than op-ache alone. no significant changes
were observed with respect to the spontaneous reactivation in
the presence or absence of mab 25b1.
the effect of mab on the rate of aging and oxime-induced
reactivation was correlated with chemical changes occurring
in the covalent conjugate op-ache by measuring release of
radioactivity from enzyme-bound [3h]dfp over a period of
24 h in the absence or presence of 1 m m of tmb,. results
are shown in figure 4. the rate of displacement of enzyme-bound radioactivity from [3h]dfp-ache in the
presence of 1 mm tmb, is significantly lower for mab-treated
dfp-ache than i n absence of mab 25b1 (panel a). it
appeared that mab-treated dfp-ache was slowly converted

dfp-ache with a stoichiometric amount of mab 25b1 enhanced 4-fold the rate of the assumed aging (figure 4, panel
b).
binding of mab 25b1 to thermally denatured or gdndenatured fbs-ache. to determine whether conformational
changes in regions of fbs-ache that are involved in the
catalytic mechanism alter the binding of mab 25b1, the extent
of binding of mab to either partially or completely inactivated
enzyme was correlated with the residual activity of perturbed
ache (figure 5). the same amount of antibody 25b1 was
incubated with fbs-ache that was first inactivated to different levels by increasing time of heating or increasing the
concentration of gdn-hci. since loss of ache activity in
gdn.hc1 (ph 7.4-7.6) was time dependent, the extent of
inactivation could be controlled by dilution of ache/gdn.hci
solution to stop the assumed protein unfolding by gdn-hc1.
no further changes in enzyme activity were observed in the
diluted solution over a period of 20 h. after completion of

% ache inhibition by mab 2581

figure 5: correlation between denaturation of fbs-ache and loss
of binding of mab 25b1 to denatured enzyme. thermal denaturation
(a): 21.6 nm ache (50 mm phosphate, ph 8.0) was heated at 50-51
o c for 0, io, 22, 45, 70, and 135 min. each sample was incubated
20 h (25 "c) with 3.7 nm mab 25b1. gdn.hc1 denaturation ( 0 ) :
7 1.4 nm ache was incubated for 60 min in gdn-hci solution, ph
7.4-7.6, at the following concentrations: 0, 0.9, 1.1, 1.35, and 1.60
m. each sample was diluted io-fold in 12 nm mab 25b1 and
incubated for 20 h at 25 "c. the loss of binding of mab 25b1 to
denatured enzyme is expressed as increased inhibition of residual ache
by fixed concentration of mab 25b1.

the reaction between gd-treated ache and mab 25b1, residual activity of the perturbed enzyme was measured. the
results demonstrated that the percent inhibition of residual
activity of ache by mab 25b1 could be correlated with the
residual activity of the perturbed enzyme before the addition
of mab 25b1. it would appear that the affinity of mab 25b1
for either thermally perturbed or gdn.hc1-perturbed ache
decreased significantly and that mab 25b1 preferentially
bound to the native form of the enzyme. when enzyme activity (0.04 pm ache) was protected against heat denaturation by 35 pm of either  xxxd3027xxx  or  xxxd1968xxx  (70-89%
loss of enzyme activity in unprotected ache), no significant
changes were observed in the stoichiometry of the binding of
mab 25b1 to the protected enzyme compared to unprotected
enzyme. ache, when complexed to mab 25b1, could be
protected ( > 5 5 % ) against thermal denaturation under conditions that caused complete loss of free ache activity (5 min
a t 56 "c).
relative affinity of mab 25b1 for native and phosphorylated fbs-ache. since mab 25b1 appears to significantly
affect the catalytic machinery of fbs-ache, it was important
to determine whether modifying the active site of the enzyme
by irreversible op inhibitors would cause any detectable
changes in its binding to mab 25b1. solid-phase immunoassay technique (elisa) could not be used for quantitation
of these experiments, since partial and variable inactivation
(denaturation) of enzyme was observed as a result of its coating
to the microtiter plate wells. therefore, the effect of the
presence of op-ache (>95% inhibition of enzyme activity)
on the inhibition of native fbs-ache by mab 25b1 was
measured in homogeneous solution to determine the relative
affinity of various op-aches for mab 25b1. for example,
if 0.023 p m ache was 42% inhibited by 0.006 pm mab
25b1, one would expect that the addition of 0.023 pm opache (assuming that mab 25b1 displayed the same affinity
for op-ache as for native ache) and an increase in the
concentration of mab 25b1 to 0.012 pm would lead to the
same degree of inhibition (le., 42%). however, as illustrated
in figure 6 for (c2h,0)2p(0)-ache and summarized in
table i 1 for six different op-ache conjugates, the affinity
of mab 25b1 for phosphorylated ache was slightly but
definitely lower than the affinity observed for the native en-

figure 6: effect of presence of phosphorylated ache on rate of
inhibition of native ache by mab 25b1: (0)0.023 pm ache +
0.006 pm 25b1 (42% inhibition); ( 0 )0.023 pm ache + 0.012 pm
25b1 (83% inhibition); ( x ) 0.023 pm ache + 0.023 pm
(c2hs0)2p(0)-ache + 0.012 pm 25b1. the extent of inhibition
of ache by mab 25b1 is proportional to the concentrationof antibody
added to reaction mixture (0;0 ) . in the presence of equal amounts
of native and phosphorylated ache, the extent of inhibition was not
proportional to the concentration of mab 25b1 added (x), indicating
that the affinity of native enzyme for mab 25b1 is higher than that
of phosphorylated enzyme (affinity ratio = 1.3).

nonaged forms of dfp-inhibited ache [(ipro)p(o)(o-)ache and (ipro),p(o)-ache] were the least stable forms
of op-ache. the stability rank order shown in table i11
suggests that negative charge on the phosphoryl residue in aged
op-ache conjugates is only partially responsible for the
increased protection conferred to the active site region against
external perturbants. the relative stability of the various
op-ache conjugates toward heat and gdn-hc1 denaturation
can be correlated with their affinity for mab 25b1 (table 11).
the phosphonyl group in ch,p(o)(o-)-ache, which only
slightly changed the affinity of ache for mab 25b1, significantly stabilized the conformation around the active site
of ache. in contrast, dfp-induced inhibition of ache (both
aged and nonaged forms) and the conjugate (c,h,o),p(0)-ache, which displayed the greatest decrease in affinity
of ache for mab 25b1 (table 11), were also found to provide
the least stabilization among op-aches in this study (table
111).
immunoadsorbance assays. solid-phase immunoadsorbance assays consistently showed that fbs-ache phosphorylated by either dfp (aged and nonaged forms), paraoxon,
mepq, or (c,h,o)p(o)ci, displayed reduced affinity for
mab 25b1. in contrast, a small but definite increase in affinity
of ch,p(o)(o-)-ache for 25b1 was observed, irrespective
of the ligand used for its preparation. brimijoin et al. (1985)
also reported that dfp-inhibited ache from rabbit brain
reduced the affinity of ache for a monoclonal antibody raised
against native ache. since native fbs-ache partially lost
enzymic activity during the process of coating of microtiter
wells. data (not shown) represent the combined effects of
denaturation of antigens and the inherent affinity of immobilized ache and op-ache for mab 25b1. despite the
uncertainty in the interpretation of results from the binding
experiments it is important to emphasize that ch,p(o)(o-)-ache displayed the highest affinity for 25b1 among

ashani et al.
all op-aches tested, including native enzyme. these results
are in agreement with the stability rank order for op-aches
in homogeneous solutions (table 111).
discussion
in this study we have placed particular emphasis on the
analysis and characterization of a unique mabeache complex
which permitted its use for the determination of stability rank
order of various op-ache conjugates against denaturation.
characterization of mab 25blaache complex. sensitivity
of mab 25b1 to conformational changes around the catalytic
domains of fbs-ache induced by external perturbants suggests that the antigenic determinants constitute a conformational epitope located, at least in part, within protein segments
that control the catalytic activity of ache. stability of the
mab 25bi-ache complex ( k d < lo-', m) is >1000-fold
higher than values reported for an inhibitory mab raised
against rabbit brain ache (brimijoin et al., 1985). high
specificity and the stability of the complex formed between
mab 25b1 and fbs-ache indicate the existence of a remarkable complementarity between interacting surfaces.
in contrast to the loss of reactivity (i.e., nucleophilicity) of
mab-bound ache toward both substrates and inhibitors
(> 104-fold decrease in the reactivity toward mepq),
mab-op-ache was only 2-10 times less susceptible to
reactivation in the presence of external nucleophiles than
op-ache. accessibility of both the anionic site and the
esteratic site serine to small ligands was not severely compromised despite a decrease in the nucleophilicity of mabbound fbs-ache. these results suggest that it is possible
that inactivation of fbs-ache by mab 25b1 is largely due
to binding to an antigenic determinant(s) located outside the
amino acid sequence region containing the esteratic serine.
indeed,  xxxd3027xxx , a peripheral site ligand, clearly interfered
with the rate of inhibition of ache by mab 25b1 and was
displaced from ache upon addition of mab 25b1. in contrast,  xxxd1968xxx , a specific active site ligand, which presumably binds at the anionic site, neither affected the kinetics
of inhibition of ache nor altered the effect of  xxxd3027xxx  on
the inhibition of ache by mab 25b1. also binding of both
 xxxd3027xxx  and mab 25b1 to fbs-ache was significantly
enhanced in low ionic strength solutions, whereas  xxxd1968xxx 
responded quite modestly to such changes (table i).
monoclonal antibody 25b 1 demonstrated considerably
different properties than inhibitory antibodies raised against
ache (abe et al., 1982; brimijoin et al., 1985; sorensen et
al., 1987), in degree of inhibition of enzyme activity, specificity,
and stability of the complex formed between the two proteins.
loss of ache activity upon heating or gdn-hc1-induced
denaturation could be correlated with loss of binding of mab
25b1 to the perturbed enzyme. this is consistent with the
empirical concept of utilizing mab 25b1 to monitor changes
in the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domains of
native and phosphorylated fbs-ache following their exposure
to denaturing agents.
resistance to denaturation of op-ache. phosphorylation
of fbs-ache decreased slightly its affinity for mab 25b1.
this suggests that various phosphoryl residues are well accommodated within the active site pocket and cause only slight
changes in the spatial arrangement of the segments which
constitute the conformational epitope. the modest changes
observed could be correlated with neither the structure of the
alkyl groups nor the assumed presence of negatively charged
oxygen attached to the phosphorus atom of aged op-ache.
as evidenced by the use of mab 25b1, phosphorylation
significantly increased the conformational stability of ache

stability of native and phosphorylated aches
to heat and gdn-hc1 denaturation. similar protection was
also achieved by reversible inhibitors such as  xxxd3027xxx ,
 xxxd1968xxx , and mab 25b1, provided that sufficient ligand
was present when the ache was exposed to environmental
perturbants. since the enhancement of conformational stability was achieved by ligands that inhibit ache by different
mechanisms, it is suggested that the common denominator
underlying the enhanced conformational stability is restriction
of movement of catalytic domain(s) through internal crosslinking of protein segments by protecting ligands. the o p
residue attached to the esteratic serine may offer four simultaneous binding sites for formation of internal cross-bridges
between protein segments constituting the active site.
perhaps the most important finding of this work is the
conformational stability displayed by ch,p(o)(o-)-ache.
this conjugate consistently demonstrated the highest resistance
to conformational changes in ache induced by either temperature or gdn-hci denaturation. the present report provides the first experimental evidence that among the o p ligands tested in this study the combination of a methyl group
and a negatively charged oxygen attached to a p atom, e.g.,
soman-inhibited ache, constitutes the most efficient stabilization of the active site region toward denaturing effects. the
ch,p(o)(o-)-ache complex closely resembles the assumed
shape of the transition-state geometry for the hydrolysis of
acetylcholine and thus substantiates the hypothesis that the
tetrahedral configuration centered around the p atom of the
soman-inhibited ache presents the closest transition-state
analogue for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ashani & green,
1981).
conclusions. monoclonal antibody 25b 1 defines a conformational epitope on fbs-ache in close proximity to the
catalytic center of fbs-ache. its unique properties permitted
its use as a molecular probe for studying the relationship of
the structure of organophosphoryl residues attached to the
active site serine of the inhibited enzyme and the enhanced
resistance of the catalytic domains of ache to denaturing
agents. the results suggest that the increased resistance of
ch,p(o)(o-)-ache to denaturation relative to either the
native enzyme or other op-ache conjugates may be employed to describe in detail the relative spatial orientation of
several binding sites within the catalytic center of fbs-ache.
