crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of the
formiminotransferase domain from the bifunctional
enzyme formiminotransferaseÂ±cyclodeaminase
formiminotransferaseÂ±cyclodeaminase (e.c. 2.1.2.5Â±e.c. 4.3.1.4) is a
bifunctional enzyme involved in the histidine-degradation pathway
which exhibits speciÂ®city for polyglutamylated folate substrates. the
Â®rst function of the enzyme transfers the formimino group of
formiminoglutamate to the n5 position of tetrahydrofolate, while the
second function catalyses the cyclodeamination of the formimino
group, yielding n5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate, with efÂ®cient channeling of the intermediate between these activities. initial studies
have shown that the enzyme consists of eight identical subunits of
62 kda each, arranged as a circular tetramer of dimers. it is this
formation which results in two different dimeric interfaces, which are
necessary for the two different activities. the identical subunits have
been shown to consist of two domains, each of which can be obtained
as dimers. the formiminotransferase domain has been crystallized in
the presence of the substrate analogue  xxxd2147xxx . the crystals
belong to space group p212121, with unit-cell dimensions a = 64.4,

the
bifunctional
enzyme
formiminotransferaseÂ±cyclodeaminase ( xxxg817xxx ) catalyses
two independent sequential reactions in the
histidine-degradation pathway in mammalian
liver. the transferase activity of  xxxg817xxx  transfers the formimino group of formiminoglutamate to the n5 position of tetrahydrofolate,
producing 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate and
glutamate. the cyclodeaminase activity catalyses the cyclization of the formimino group
yielding n5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate and
releasing ammonia (see fig. 1). by transferring
a one-carbon unit from formiminoglutamate to
tetrahydrofolate, these enzymatic reactions
serve as an additional contribution to the onecarbon tetrahydrofolate pool.
 xxxg817xxx  has been determined to consist of
eight identical subunits arranged to form a
circular octamer (beaudet & mackenzie, 1975;
mackenzie et al., 1980). it comprises eight
identical subunits of 62 kda each, which are
arranged in an octamer, more accurately
described as a tetramer of dimers, which results
in the formation of two different subunit
interfaces. dissociation and renaturation
studies of  xxxg817xxx  suggested that one dimeric
interface is responsible for the transferase
activity and the other for the cyclodeaminase
activity (findlay & mackenzie, 1988). further
evidence supporting this Â®nding was provided by deletion mutagenesis (murley &
mackenzie, 1995). these studies showed that

each subunit consists of a n- xxxg647xxx  active domain and a c-terminal deaminase active domain which are separated by a
short linker sequence. expression and puriÂ®cation showed that each domain exists as a
monofunctional dimer (murley & mackenzie,
1995).
binding studies demonstrated that there are
four polyglutamate binding sites per octamer
(paquin et al., 1985) and that the polyglutamate-binding speciÂ®city resides in the
deaminase domain (knighton et al., 1994).
 xxxg817xxx  can channel polyglutamylated formiminotetrahydrofolate between the transferase
and deaminase active sites (mackenzie, 1979;
mackenzie et al., 1980). substrate channeling
is a kinetic process by which a metabolite or
intermediate is directly transferred from one
enzyme active site to another site distanced
from the Â®rst without being released from the
enzyme into solution. this process increases
the efÂ®ciency in product transfer between
active sites within an enzymatic reaction
pathway and thus increases the rate of the
overall reaction. two different molecular
mechanisms have been observed for channeling. in the enzyme tryptophan synthase, a
Ãª long hydrophobic tunnel has been
25 a
observed to channel the hydrophobic intermediate indole between the two active sites
(hyde et al., 1988). in contrast to a buried
tunnel, the enzyme  xxxg2366xxx Â±

major reveals a large positive electrostatic
Ãª distance
surface straddling the 40 a
between the two active sites, which is
believed to allow channeling of the hydrophilic polyglutamate form of the substrate
between the active sites (knighton et al.,
1994). formiminotransferaseÂ±cyclodeaminase also uses a non-covalently linked
polyglutamate form of the substrate;
however, this protein has a much greater
speciÂ®city for the length of the polyglutamate chain than has been observed for
 xxxg2366xxx Â± xxxg631xxx , and optimal channeling is observed
with the pentaglutamate form of the
substrate (mackenzie, 1979). the chainlength speciÂ®city led to the postulate that
the polyglutamate chain acts to anchor the
substrate to the octamer, thereby allowing
the substrate to move optimally between
active sites (mackenzie & baugh, 1980).
there are a number of advantages for
enzymes to express two distinct catalytic
functions in a single gene and to channel the
intermediate between the two active sites. in
the case of tryptophan synthase, channeling
provides a useful means by which the nonpolar intermediate can be retained with
minimal loss by escape through the cell

figure 1

membrane. in the case of thymidylate
synthaseÂ±dihydrofolate
reductase,
the
binding of the substrate to the enzyme
through a polyglutamyl group may prevent
the loss of the intermediate by diffusion
through the solution. channeling could be
advantageous to formiminotransferaseÂ±
cyclodeaminase, since the formiminotransferase reaction produces a labile intermediate which would degrade upon release
to the surrounding solution before the
second reaction could be completed.
in order to further understand the molecular details of channeling by this bifunctional enzyme and to characterize the
distinct catalytic mechanisms, we have
undertaken crystallographic studies of
 xxxg817xxx . here, we report crystals of the
formiminotransferase domain in the
presence of the bound substrate analogue
 xxxd2147xxx . in addition, we outline preliminary heavy-atom data statistics.

2. results and discussion
2.1. protein puriÂ®cation and crystallization

hexahistidine-tagged
formiminotransferase domain was overexpressed using the

the reaction catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme, formiminotransferase-cyclodeamainase. the Â®rst step
involves the transfer of a formimino group from formiminoglutamate to n5 of tetrahydrofolate and is catalyzed
by the formiminotransferase domain of the enzyme. the second step is catalyzed by the cyclodeaminase domain
and involves the cyclization of n5-formimino-tetrahydrofolate to produce n 5;10 -methenyl-tetrahydrofolate.

pbke-cm1 expression vector in escherichia
coli strain bl21/de3 and puriÂ®ed to
homogeneity as described previously
(murley & mackenzie, 1995), omitting the
last deae sepharose column. the pooled
fractions containing the ft domain were
then dialyzed into 25 mm mops ph 8.2,
10 mm k2so4 ph 7.3, 35 mm - xxxd26xxx  and 10%(v/v) glycerol, with the
addition of 20 mm edta to remove any
ni2+ which may have leached from the
ni-nta column. the protein was dialyzed
again in the same buffer excluding edta to
remove any chelated ni2+ and edta. it was
then concentrated to 8 mg mlÃ¿1 using a
centriprep 10 and centricon 3 (amicon
inc.). protein concentrations were determined using a bradford assay with bsa as
the standard.
crystallization conditions were screened
by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion
technique. initial trials using a sparsematrix screen, described by jancarik &
kim (1991), showed a promising granular
precipitate with some precipitants (ammonium sulfate, sodium formate, sodium
citrate,  xxxd2982xxx  2000 and 8000).
further crystallization experiments around
these conditions did not result in any
signiÂ®cant improvement. it is well known
that many proteins have considerable
conformational Â¯exibility. this Â¯exibility is
a source of structural heterogeneity which
may act to inhibit crystallization. structural
heterogeneity is particularly prevalent
when one is dealing with multidomain
proteins where the interdomain contacts
may be rather Â¯exible (sousa, 1997). it was
thought that introduction of a ligand to the
crystallization trials of ft domain might
act to enhance crystal formation, particularly if such conformational Â¯exibility
exists. the ligand may act to `lock' the
protein in a single conformational state,
thus rendering it more amenable to crystallization. for this reason, we decided to
screen crystallization conditions of ft
domain with various substrates and
substrate analogues. in particular, the
substrate analogues 2 mm  xxxd2147xxx  and
2 mm glutamate were added, either together
or independently, to the conditions from the
random screening which gave the most
granular precipitates. x-ray diffraction
quality crystals were obtained using 1 m
sodium citrate, 100 mm tris ph 8.0 and
15%(v/v) glycerol as mother liquor with the
addition of 2 mm  xxxd2147xxx  to the protein
buffer described above. equal volumes of
mother liquor and protein were mixed in a
drop and the trays were incubated at 290 k
for two weeks, after which crystals with a

2.2. data collection and preliminary x-ray
analysis

prolonged exposure of crystals mounted
in a glass capillary tube to the x-ray beam at
room temperature revealed signiÂ®cant
sample decay. to avoid this decay during
data collection, crystals were brieÂ¯y transferred into a drop of the cryoprotectant,
paratone 8277 (exxon oil), mounted in a
rayon loop (hampton research co.) and
transferred to a stream of nitrogen at 80 k
generated by an adsc (area detector

data from one native and one heavy-atom

and scaled using the hkl software (minor,
1993; otwinowski, 1993). autoindexing

using a molecular mass of 74 kda (for the
homodimer) and assuming the presence of
one dimer per asymmetric unit, a vm value
Ãª 3 daÃ¿1 was obtained. this value
of 2.95 a
falls within the range observed by matthews
(1968) and corresponds to a solvent content
of 50%.

will be used to solve the phase problem. to
this end, a heavy-atom derivative was
prepared by soaking crystals in a solution of
mother liquor with 1 mm p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (pcmbs) for 4 h. data
were collected and processed identically to
that for the native (table 1). two hg-atom

parameters for these two positions were
reÂ®ned using the program mlphare from
the ccp4 suite. initial phase estimates

revealed that the mercurial derivative is
weakly occupied, as seen by the phasing
power of 0.91 and the rcullis of 0.79. a search
for other derivatives is currently under way,
with the expectation that one or two further
derivatives with a greater occupancy in
combination with solvent Â¯attening and
twofold averaging will yield an interpretable
electron-density map.
