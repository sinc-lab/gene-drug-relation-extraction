to the dopamine (da) hypothesis of schizophrefunctional excess of dopaminergic activity within
unspecified areas of the brain in schizophrenic patients. as a
clinical test of this hypothesis, we administered  xxxd2634xxx  for
three weeks to symptomatic chronic male schizophrenic
patients who were maintained on suboptimal doses of neuroleptic agents.  xxxd2634xxx  inhibits  xxxg2276xxx , the ratelimiting enzymatic step in the synthesis of da.
no clinical improvement was observed, using the national
institute of mental health inpatient behavioral rating scale or
the brief psychiatric rating scale. central inhibition of da
synthesis by  xxxd2634xxx  was suggested, however, by (1) the
development of extrapyramidal side effects and (2) a significant
increase in plasma prolactin concentrations. plasma chlorpromazine concentrations remained unchanged during  xxxd2634xxx 
treatment.
there was, nevertheless, a significant improvement on the
scores of the wechsler adult intelligence scale comprehension
subtest, which measures judgment and common sense. this
finding suggests that da may be involved in the regulation of
subtle psychological processes.
the results are discussed in light of the da hypothesis of
schizophrenia and previous reports suggesting that  xxxd2634xxx

from the

lines of evidence

that certain

psychoses,

may be associated with exces¬
sive dopaminergic functional activity.1 the amphetamine
psychosis is considered to be the best experimental model
of paranoid psychosis in man; dopamine is thought to

mediate this condition.23 psychotic symptoms in
schizophrenic patients may be unmasked or intensified by
the administration of methylphenidate," which is believed
to increase functional dopamine (da), or by levodopa,5
which is converted to da in the body. in addition, all
neuroleptics that are used to treat schizophrenia are
thought to exert their effect by blocking da receptors.79
 xxxd2634xxx  is an inhibitor of  xxxg2276xxx , the
rate-limiting enzymatic step in the synthesis of da and
norepinephrine1" (fig 1). if the da hypothesis is correct,
then by decreasing the synthesis of da,  xxxd2634xxx  should
theoretically have a therapeutic effect in schizophrenia
similar to that of the neuroleptic drugs that block da
receptors. while three studies by one group of investiga¬
tors reported that  xxxd2634xxx  reduced the dosage of pheno¬
thiazines needed to treat schizophrenic patients,12"14 two
different investigations reported that  xxxd2634xxx  given

animal studies with  xxxd2634xxx  show that it potentiates
the effect of subthreshold doses of reserpine and chlorpro¬

pimozide22 and haloperidol23 on appetitively conditioned

although nonblind members of the research team
thought there was a mild but transient improvement in
several patients during the  xxxd2634xxx  trial (lasting only
for the first seven to ten days of  xxxd2634xxx  administra¬
tion), this observation was not reflected in the clinical
rating scales.
the psychosis score of the nimh inpatient behavioral
rating scale (average for the last two weeks of each
period) did not show significant differences among the
three periods (placebo,  xxxd2634xxx , placebo) (table 3). one

side effects

sedation.—all the patients showed mild to moderate
sedation during the first few days they received metyro¬
sine. most of this effect faded after the first week.
crystalluria.—amino acid crystals were not noted in the
urinary sediment of any patient. increased amorphous
phosphate was noted in some patients, as well as cylinderoids, calcium oxalate, urate, or triple phosphate crystals in
others. the patients' fluid intake was adequately main¬
tained as reflected by an average urine output of 2.5 liters/
24 hr. no urinary tract complications were observed.
hypotension.—only the patient receiving thioridazine
(no. 59) had othostatic hypotension during the  xxxd2634xxx 
trial. his supine blood pressure remained unchanged at
105/65 mm hg; however, his standing blood pressure
ranged from 90/50 to as low as 60/40 mm hg. one other
patient (no. 62) showed a mild degree of orthostatic
hypotension, perhaps related to his plasma chlorpromazine
concentration, which was substantially higher than other
patients receiving the same dose of chlorpromazine.
extrapyramidal reactions.—to varying extents, all of the
patients developed extrapyramidal reactions with metyro¬
sine. this initially manifested itself in most of the patients
by stiff posture, drooling, and shuffling gait. within ten
days, all but three developed tolerance to these effects. one
of this latter group of patients (no. 59) continued to have
rigidity, drooling, dysarthria, and a parkinsonian tremor of
both hands despite anticholinergic treatment. another
(no. 61) developed drooling and a marked parkinsonian
tremor of both hands as well as the mandible, along with
cogwheel rigidity in all extremities. the third patient (no.
66) exhibited a generalized tremor of all the extremities,
incontinence, copious sweating, loss of capacity to care for
himself, and frequent falling after his knees would
"buckle" under him. he did not respond to intramuscularly
or intravenously given benztropine mesylate or to reduc¬
tion of the  xxxd2634xxx  dosage from 3 to 1.5 gm/day but did

ride. because of these side effects, the patient was then
given placebo after only ten days of receiving  xxxd2634xxx .

patient stated "i feel physically lousy, but i don't feel i am
the devil anymore."

patients changed very little between the first
placebo period and the  xxxd2634xxx  trial period. in the last
placebo period, there was a significant increase (p < .01) in
plasma chlorpromazine concentrations. this occurred
despite the constancy of the daily dose of chlorpromazine.
although there are no obvious explanations for this
increase, variations in the absorption, metabolism, and
excretion of chlorpromazine following the withdrawal of
 xxxd2634xxx , resulting in higher plasma levels, are possible
explanations. it should be noted also that in five of the
seven patients, plasma chlorpromazine concentrations are
quite low when compared to the concentrations attained by
acute schizophrenic patients receiving a similar dose of
chlorpromazine." there is some evidence46 that such low
plasma chlorpromazine levels are quite common in schizo¬
phrenic patients who have been maintained on chlorprom¬
azine therapy for several years, regardless of the degree of
seven

clinical response.

plasma prolactin concentrations.—plasma prolactin con¬
centrations increased significantly (p < .005) with metyro¬
sine compared to both placebo periods (table 4). this
suggests that synthesis of da, which stimulates the
discharge of prolactin-inhibiting factor," was significantly
inhibited by  xxxd2634xxx . this evidence of da synthesis
inhibition in the absence of a significant potentiation of
the neuroleptics' antipsychotic action is an important
finding in this study.

comment

our findings indicate that the administration of metyro¬
sine (an inhibitor of da synthesis) to symptomatic chronic
schizophrenic patients maintained on moderately high
doses of phenothiazines does not potentiate the antipsy¬
chotic activity of the phenothiazines in those patients. no
significant improvement was detected on the psychosis
scores of two clinical rating scales (the nimh inpatient
behavioral rating scale and the bprs).
contrary to the expectations generated by the da
hypothesis of schizophrenia,  xxxd2634xxx  did not exert a
therapeutic potentiation of phenothiazines in our group of
chronic schizophrenic patients as measured by conven-

tional rating scales. the development of parkinsonian side
effects and the rise in plasma prolactin concentrations
point to decreased da activity in this group of patients
despite the absence of clinical improvement. this questions
the validity of a simplistic da hypothesis of schizophrenia
and undermines the assumption that the antipsychotic
activity of the phenothiazines is mediated solely by
blockade of da receptors (unless da receptor hypersensi¬
tivity is shown to exist in schizophrenic states).
three other studies of  xxxd2634xxx  with phenothiazines
in schizophrenic patients12" reported a significant poten¬
tiation of phenothiazines by  xxxd2634xxx  (table 1.) we
believe that their results and ours, though dissimilar, may
actually be complementary, and a consideration of both
may provide further insight into the limitations and the
possibilities of the da hypothesis.
there are obvious differences between the populations
of schizophrenics in this study compared to the studies of
carlsson and wâlinder and colleagues (all of which are very
similar). the mean age of the population in our study is
about 26 years (all men), compared to about 63 years for
their patients (men and women). (the effect of aging on
neuropharmacological variables in schizophrenia has not
yet been defined.) the two groups differed in responsive¬
ness to phenothiazines—our patients being less responsive
to high doses of phenothiazines (at least 800 mg/day of
chlorpromazine or its equivalent) as compared with the
response their patients showed to lower doses of pheno¬
thiazines (100 to 400 mg/day of thioridazine), before the
start of the studies. in addition, our patients also achieved
lower plasma chlorpromazine concentrations than did their
patients, based on dose equivalence of the drug, despite the

higher dosage.
one might therefore predict less impact of  xxxd2634xxx 
on schizophrenic patients who show little response to da
receptor blocking agents (neuroleptics) and/or are barely
controlled by them. there is also the possibility that
 xxxd2634xxx  may potentiate thioridazine more than chlor¬
 xxxd3024xxx  or other phenothiazines, since thioridazine is
thought to have a much weaker da receptor blocking
activity than most phenothiazines,48 and possibly more
likely to be potentiated by the da synthesis-inhibiting
effects of  xxxd2634xxx .
thus, responsiveness to phenothiazines might be a diag¬
nostic difference between the two patient populations,4"
one a neuroleptic responsive schizophrenia and the other a
neuroleptic-resistent (or neuroleptic-tolerant) schizophre¬

nia.
carlsson and wâlinder and colleagues do not specify
some of their patients' diagnosis beyond "chronic schizo¬
phrenia," and do not describe the onset, duration, and
course of several patients.1"' our patients are early-onset
(before age 17) schizophrenics with progressive deteriora¬
tion, whose illness has plateaued and whose disability
remains high. they all had the features of more than one of
the following rdc categories: (1) paranoid, (2) hebephrenic
(ie, disorganized), (3) confusional turmoil, or (4) catatonic.
hence, they were diagnosed as chronic undifferentiated
schizophrenics. many of our patients manifested features
from all the above categories. three patients with rela¬
tively prominent paranoid features had a slightly greater

downloaded from: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a new york university user on 06/21/2015

(though

not statistically significant) improvement. pa¬
tients with prominent hebephrenic features were noted to
be the least improved clinically with the addition of
 xxxd2634xxx  to their neuroleptic regimen. this suggests
that the paranoid features of schizophrenia may be more
responsive to da blockade than hebephrenic features and
would support the previously described clinical differences
between these two types of schizophrenia,3" especially in
their pure form. it is important to note that the amphet¬
amine model of schizophrenia, which is presumably
mediated by a functional increase in da, simulates the
paranoid type of schizophrenia, and is also highly respon¬
sive to da antagonists such as neuroleptics.
another difference between our study and the carlssonwálinder studies is the sequence of administration of
neuroleptics and  xxxd2634xxx . in effect, they gave metyro¬
sine (2,000 mg/day for 6 to 50 weeks) before the neuroleptic
(presynaptic blockade of da synthesis followed by postsynaptic da receptor blockade), whereas we gave the neuro¬
leptic before the  xxxd2634xxx  (postsynaptic da receptor
blockade followed by presynaptic da synthesis blockade).
it is not known whether the order of presynaptic and
postsynaptic da blockade in such a situation could affect
the outcome. consider the alterations in regulation of da
metabolism of both designs: if the neuroleptic is given first
(our design) then postsynaptic da receptor blockade would
result in a compensatory increase in da turnover, ie,
increased synthesis, which would then have to be blocked
by subsequent administration of  xxxd2634xxx . if the mety¬
rosine is given first (carlsson-wâlinder design) then
synthesis of da would be reduced (presynaptic blockade),
resulting in a compensatory hypersensitivity of da postsy¬
naptic receptors, which would then be blocked by neuro¬
leptic administration. the question is whether the last
sequence has a better antipsychotic effect in chronic
schizophrenia (for an as yet undiscovered reason) then the
former sequence. if so, then the difference in design could
explain the difference in results.
the duration of  xxxd2634xxx  administration is probably
not an important difference since  xxxd2634xxx  would inhibit
"fresh synthesis" of da, and the "existing stores" of da
are depleted within a few hours (half-life of da is about
two hours in the rat.)31
the only significant improvement with  xxxd2634xxx  in
our clinically unimproved patient population was on the
comprehension subtest of the wais; this suggests the
apparent sensitivity of this subtest to identify subtle
changes in schizophrenic thinking otherwise obscured in
clinical observations. the comprehension subtest is
supposed to "measure the degree to which the subject has
been able to evaluate accurately a sample of past experi¬
ence (including the vicarious) and apply it to everyday
social situations. it also assesses the degree of social
acculturation, particularly in the sphere of moral or ethical

judgments."3-

could da blockade by  xxxd2634xxx  produce a subtle
improvement in the cognitive sphere that is measured by
comprehension but not reflected in the clinical rating
scales? twenty years ago, in a study of a group of mentally
retarded patients, comprehension and digit symbol were
found to be the only two wais subtests to improve

significantly with the administration of 100 mg of chlor¬
 xxxd3024xxx .31 on the other hand, donnelly and chase"
reported that comprehension was the only wais subtest
affected adversely over time by levodopa, a da precursor,
in a group of parkinson patients. also, various studies with
the binet test in schizophrenics have pointed to poor
performance on questions involving practical judgment,
such as comprehension demands.3436 all these findings
suggest that increased da activity in the central nervous
system (by levodopa administration, and possibly in schizo¬
phrenia) could be detrimental to judgment as measured by
the comprehension subtest, whereas an inhibition of da
activity in the central nervous system (by neuroleptics
and/or  xxxd2634xxx ) might improve the ability to formulate
judgments.
thus, the significant improvement in our patients'
comprehension scores during the  xxxd2634xxx  trial, along
with a lack of overt clinical improvement, points to a subtle
improvement associated with the  xxxd2634xxx -induced inhi¬
bition of da synthesis, which might have gone unnoticed if
only clinical rating scales were used. this finding, if
replicated, would open new vistas of research into the
specific psychological effects of da and other neurotransmitters in man. comprehension itself is dependent on the
ability to synthesize associations from information, past
experience, abstraction, and social awareness, and it is
possibly defective57 in the chronic schizophrenic (hyperdopaminergic?) state, and therefore sensitive to da-inhibiting drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. any

future work in this area undertaken to substantiate  xxxd2634xxx -related improvement in comprehension scores
should include other psychological tests as controls.
there was a tendency (albeit insignificant) for the
depression scores to increase on the nimh inpatient
rating scale, but to decrease on the bprs, while the
patients received  xxxd2634xxx . this lack of a significant
increase in clinical depression scores confirms other
reports38 that the inhibition of brain da and norepineph¬
rine synthesis by  xxxd2634xxx  does not produce clinical

depression even though  xxxd2634xxx  reduces da and norep¬
inephrine metabolite concentrations more than is found in
depressed patients. the clinical effects of  xxxd2634xxx  seem
to be sedation and psychomotor retardation rather than
depression.
in summary, the lack of potentiation of phenothiazines
by  xxxd2634xxx  in our group of chronic schizophrenics, in
contrast to other studies that confirm such a potentiation,
could be due to the more severe form of schizophrenia in
our patients in which da blockade is probably not as
therapeutic as it is assumed to be in other types of
schizophrenia. there are, however, areas of equivocal
findings in both our study: the initial mild and transient
clinical improvement (by nonblind judges) and the signifi¬
cant improvement on the comprehension subtest. in this
regard, wâlinder et al" note that the rating psychiatrists
disagreed with the rating nurses about improvement in
some patients, and that the nurses' impressions prevailed
over the psychiatrists'. this points to the persistence of
"doubt" in this crucial area of psychiatric research, and
should prompt further attempts at clarifying the role of
da in the schizophrenia syndrome.
