in the failing heart

abstract the sympathetic nervous system provides the
most powerful stimulation of cardiac function, brought
about via norepinephrine and epinephrine and their postsynaptic b-adrenergic receptors. more than 30 years after
the first use of  xxxd2991xxx  in patients with heart failure
betablockers are now the mainstay of the pharmacological
treatment of chronic heart failure. many aspects of their
mechanism of action are well understood, but others
remain unresolved. this review focuses on a number of
questions that are key to further developments in the field.
what accounts for and what is the role of b-adrenergic
desensitization, a hallmark of the failing heart? is part of
this adaptation predominantly beneficial and should therefore be reinforced, another part mainly maladaptive and
therefore a target for antagonists? which lessons can be
drawn from studies in genetically engineered mice, which
from (pharmaco) genetic studies? finally, what are promising targets downstream of b-adrenergic receptors that go
beyond the current neurohumoral blockade?

mainly with the idea of rate reduction to save energy [1]. it
may be that part of the early success was due to patient
selection (myocarditis), but the gotenburg group persevered and thus laid ground for one of the mainstays of heart
failure therapy today. why did the betablocker concept
need[20 years to be accepted? one reason is that blocking
the stimulatory action of catecholamines in a situation
where the heart is ‘‘catecholamine-dependent’’ is counterintuitive. of course, we now know that betablockers do not
‘‘block’’ the receptor (but just shift the concentrationsresponse to the right) and that time and dosing are critical issues. but it is still difficult to understand that
betablockers reverse b-adrenergic desensitization (e.g.
reverse downregulation of b-adrenergic receptors, b-ar)
and yet, the very same downregulation of b-ar is considered by most a protective mechanism.
the present review article summarizes the current
knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involved in
normal b-ar signaling, their alterations in heart failure and
their possible pathophysiological role. the underlying
concept (fig. 1) is that heart failure is a clinical syndrome
that represents the common final pathway of a variety of
diseases characterized by compromised contractile function of the heart. the body reacts to this situation with
activation of neurohumoral systems that, from an evolutionary point of view, are intended to stabilize blood
pressure and cardiac output. the most important one is
the sympathetic nervous system with its transmitters
norepinephrine and epinephrine. acutely, elevated catecholamines indeed stimulate the heart to use its remaining
chronotropic and inotropic reserve. chronically, however,
the concomitant increase in afterload as well as the direct
energy consuming, hypertrophic and apoptotic actions on
the cardiac myocyte further deteriorate cardiac function
and thereby constitute a vicious circle. in this concept,

fig. 1 vicious circle in heart failure. cardiac injury that reduces
contractile performance leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous
system. acutely, norepinephrine serves as a mechanism that stabilizes
perfusion of the body by stimulating heart rate and force. if the
pumping defect continues, however, the sustained ‘‘overstimulation’’
turns from ‘‘good’’ to ‘‘bad’’ because of (i) peripheral vasoconstriction, which further reduces cardiac output and (ii) cardiac myocyte

toxicity in form of increased energy consumption, cell death, fibrosis,
cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and arrhythmia. norepinephrine operates through b-adrenergic receptors (ars), stimulatory g proteins
(gs), adenylyl cyclase (ac) and the second messenger camp. in
heart failure, the signaling cascade is normally desensitized in
response to chronic norepinephrine stimulation, an adaptation that can
be viewed as mainly beneficial (adapted from ref. 2)

desensitization of the b-ar signaling pathway, i.e., the
partial loss of responsiveness, is a predominantly protective
mechanism [2]. and betablockers have two major beneficial effects that slow down the vicious circle. first, by
competing with catecholamines for their binding to b-ar
they reduce their adverse effects on the heart directly. and
second, by the same mechanism they reduce the signal that
causes desensitization of the b-ar signaling pathway,
allowing the system to ‘‘resensitize’’. this increases the
responsiveness to catecholamines (and thus exercise tolerance), but can also contribute to improving cardiac
function under unstimulated conditions because many of
the elements of the b-ar signaling pathway exert constitutive activity.
the clinical evidence for the beneficial effects of
betablockers and the detrimental effects of camp-dependent inotropes such as catecholamines or phosphodiesterase
inhibitors is clear. similarly, the vast majority of experimental data is compatible with the above concept
that chronic stimulating the b-ar/camp pathway has
detrimental consequences and b-ar desensitization is
protective. yet, it is also quite evident that b-ar desensitization has a downside, be it the reduced exercise tolerance,
the reduced relaxation speed of the myofilament or the
compromised ca2? handling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
a central question in the field is whether these problems can
be selectively targeted by therapy without stimulating the
entire b-ar/camp-system.

the cardiac b-adrenergic signaling pathway controls
contractile performance

123

under exercise the healthy heart is able to increase its
output nearly five fold within seconds. this ‘fight-or-flight’
response is primarily mediated by the sympathetic nervous
system through neuronally released norepinephrine and
epinephrine, acting on cardiac myocytes mainly via the
b-adrenergic signaling system (fig. 2). cardiac myocytes
express three different b-adrenergic receptor (b-ar) subtypes: b1- and b2-ar are the quantitatively dominant
regulators of cardiac performance [3–9]. binding of the
adrenergic amines to b1- and b2-ar increases cardiac
contractility, frequency, and rate of relaxation as well as
impulse conduction through the av node. the functional
role of the b3-subtype remains uncertain [5]. some evidence suggests preferential coupling of cardiac b3-ar to
inhibitory g proteins (gi) and negative inotropic effects
[10]. on the other hand, analyses in recombinant cell lines
and adipocytes [11], transgenic overexpression [11], and
recent pharmacological data in human right atria [11]
rather point to canonical coupling to stimulatory g proteins
(gs) and positive inotropic effects.
the b1-ar is the most abundant subtype in the normal
heart (70–80%) and is a prototypical gs-coupled receptor.
its stimulation leads to increased  xxxd1773xxx  production via
adenylyl cyclases (ac) with  xxxg69xxx  and ac6 being the predominant cardiac isoforms [12]. the b2-ar is also coupled

to gs and mediates a full positive chronotropic response in
human [5]. it exerts a full inotropic response in human atria,
but a less than maximal effect in ventricles. whether this
quantitative difference to b1-ar stimulation in the human
ventricle is due to additional coupling to gi as described in
rodents [13, 14], remains disputed and may depend on the
type of agonist used [5]. a recent comprehensive study in
human atrial tissues using the natural ligands norepinephrine and epinephrine concluded that the evidence is not
consistent with relevant coupling of the b2-ar to gi [15].
the primary target for camp is  xxxg1836xxx  (pka).
activated pka phosphorylates a set of key regulatory
proteins that control the excitation–contraction coupling
cycle, such as sarcolemmal l-type ca2? channels (ltcc),
sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptors (ryr2), and phospholamban (plb), which together coordinate significant
increases in cardiac inotropy [16–18]. plb is a key regulator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2? atpase
(serca2a). phosphorylation of plb at ser16 by pka
relieves its inhibition of serca2a, which greatly stimulates the rate and amount of cytosolic ca2? resequestered
into the sr. this enhances myocardial relaxation and sr
loading, which in turn generates larger ca2? transients and
force during systole [19–21]. pka-dependent phosphorylation of the myofibrillar proteins troponin i (tni) at
ser23/24 and cardiac myosin-binding protein c (mybpc)
at ser282 decreases myofibrillar ca2? sensitivity and
thereby accelerates relaxation of myofilaments [22, 23].
another downstream target of pka is phospholemman.

it was recognized in early phosphorylation assays as a
strongly regulated phosphoprotein in the sarcolemmal
fraction [24], but its role was enigmatic until recently. we
now know that it is  xxxg220xxx  of the na?/k?-atpase [25].
analogous to plb/serca interactions, pka-phosphorylation of phospholemman relieves its inhibitory influence,
thereby stimulating the sodium pump.
the action of camp/pka is counterbalanced by camp
phosphodiesterases (pde) and protein phosphatases (pp)
[26–30] (fig. 3). in the mammalian heart, more than 90%
of total pp activity is contributed by the ser/thr phosphatases types 1 and 2a (pp1 and pp2a) [31, 32]. they
stem from a common gene family and are highly homologous [27]. their action is controlled mainly by
localization and accessory subunits which are organized in
macromolecular signaling complexes containing not only
pp, pka, and the respective target protein, but also various
pdes (fig. 3) [26]. the complexes involve scaffolding
proteins such as a-kinase anchoring proteins (akaps),
which target pka in proximity to its substrates and thus
confer specificity of camp signaling [33–35].
interestingly, one pp1-subunit, the pp1 inhibitor-1 (i-1),
is phosphorylated by pka at thr35 and thereby activated.
the consequence is less pp1-mediated plb dephosphorylation and thus amplification of the pka-mediated
responses enhancing contractility (positive feedback loop)
[36–38]. conversely, i-1 is dephosphorylated and deactivated by the ca2?-dependent type 2b phosphatase
(calcineurin), thus constituting a cross-talk mechanism

fig. 3 compartmentation of camp/pka signaling through macromolecular complexes at the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac
myocytes. b-adrenergic/camp/pka-dependent phosphorylation is
partly controlled by a-kinase anchoring proteins, scaffolding proteins
which target pka in proximity to its substrates (for example ryr2
and plb) and other regulators such as phosphodiesterases (pde),
protein phosphatase type-1 ( xxxd1100xxx ) and its inhibitor-1 (i-1) specifically
at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr). this confers specificity and
localization to camp/pka signaling in cardiac myocytes

between ca2?- and camp-dependent pathways [39, 40].
moreover, i-1 may participate in a cross-talk between pka
and ca2?/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii) by inhibiting pp1-mediated dephosphorylation
(=inactivation) of camkii at thr286 [41, 42].
besides pka, camp directly activates phosphodiesterases (negative feedback loop; [43]) and hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels mediating the
heart rate-increasing effects of b-ar stimulation (fig. 2)
[44, 45]. a newly recognized target is epac (exchange protein directly activated by camp), which binds camp and
catalyzes the exchange of gdp for gtp on the small gtpase
rap [46–48]. epac1 exerts growth-promoting actions in cardiac
myocytes, is upregulated in failing human hearts, and may
mediate some of the pka-independent, but camkii-dependent detrimental effects of sustained b-ar stimulation [48, 49].

preparations from failing human hearts the positive inotropic response to catecholamines is diminished [56–58]. in
contrast, force development under unstimulated, basal
conditions (low pacing rates, low ca2?, no catecholamines)
is normal [59–61]. moreover, the force-increasing effect of
camp-independent compounds such as ouabain, sodium
channel agonists, calcium channel agonists, and calcium
itself is unchanged at low frequency of stimulation [51, 59,
62]. collectively, these data point to a specific defect in the
b-ar/camp system in heart failure.
indeed, a characteristic set of molecular alterations in
components of the b-ar signaling pathway has been
identified. these changes include a decrease in b-ar
density and mrna [63, 64], uncoupling of b-ar from gs
as a consequence of increased b-ar kinase ( xxxg970xxx  =
 xxxg970xxx ) activity [65], as well as increased gi protein and
mrna [66–69]. further downstream, the small amplifier
i-1 is downregulated and dephosphorylated [36, 70]. this
may contribute to the increase in sr-associated pp1
activity [71], the major phosphatase dephosphorylating
plb [31]. b-ar signaling abnormalities in the failing
myocardium also seem to include defects in akap-based
supramolecular complexes with impaired compartmentalization of camp/pka signaling [35, 72, 73].
given the above changes one would expect the steadystate phosphorylation level of pka substrates in the heart
to be subnormal in failing human hearts. indeed, most data
reported hypophosphorylation of plb, tni, and cmybp-c
[74–77] which may account for (part of) the relaxation
deficit of the failing heart. however, noteworthy exceptions have been reported, particularly the increase in
sarcolemmal ca2? channel (ltcc) activity (suggesting
hyperphosphorylation; [78]) and hyperphosphorylation of
ryr2 [79]. both point to cellular subcompartments in
which the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation balance is
shifted towards phosphorylation. hyperphosphorylation at
the ltcc-ryr2 interface, this hotspot of cardiac excitation–contraction coupling, may cause an increase in
systolic transsarcolemmal ca2? influx together with an
increased propensity for diastolic sr ca2? release (‘‘leaky
ryr2’’), a dangerous precondition for ectopic cardiac
automaticity and arrhythmias [79]. considerable controversy exists with regard to the exact phosphorylation site
on ryr2 and even hyperphosphorylation of the ryr2 as
such [17, 80, 81], but most researchers would agree that
targeting the ryr2 leak is a promising target.

b-adrenergic signaling is abnormal in the failing heart
a major hallmark of the failing heart is b-adrenergic
desensitization, resulting in blunted adrenergic agonist
effects on contractile performance [2, 8, 50–55]. both in
patients with heart failure and in isolated ventricular

b-adrenergic desensitization in heart failure—cause
or consequence, maladaptive or protective?
when thinking about therapeutic interventions, a critical
question is whether the described molecular alterations in

heart fail rev (2009) 14:225–241

the b-ar system in heart failure are the cause or the
consequence of heart failure. several arguments favor the
latter: (i) b-ar desensitization is a common feature of all
forms of heart failure, independent of its etiology; (ii) it
can be faithfully reproduced by chronic catecholamine
infusion in rodents [82–86]; (iii) it essentially parallels the
severity of the clinical syndrome and thus the increase in
norepinephrine plasma levels [64, 87]. if it is an adaptation,
is it maladaptive or protective? (i) a mouse strain that
downregulates its b-ar density in response to chronic
infusion of catecholamines was protected against cardiac
toxicity compared to another strain that did not [88]; (ii) a
genetic gain-of-function variant of grk5, an enzyme
providing uncoupling and thereby desensitization of b-ar,
was recently associated with improved survival in african
americans with heart failure [89]; (iii) numerous transgenic mouse models show that overactivity of the b-ar
pathway induces a heart failure phenotype (see ‘‘lessons
from genetically engineered mice’’), but we are not aware
of any animal model in which a primary subsensitivity of
the b-ar signaling pathway is associated with cardiac
pathology; (iv) therapeutic strategies intended to simply
overcome b-ar desensitization such as catecholamines
and phosphodiesterase inhibitors cause increased mortality
[90–92], whereas betablockers decrease mortality in
patients with chronic heart failure [93–95], lead to reverse
remodeling of the ventricles [55, 96, 97], and improve
systolic function in the long term [98].
thus, b-ar desensitization appears as a predominantly
protective adaptation [2]. it is a dynamic process that follows the increase in norepinephrine plasma levels. the
signals that translate chronic b-ar stimulation by norepinephrine into downregulation of b-ar, upregulation of gia
and  xxxg970xxx , and other aspects of b-ar desensitization are
not entirely clear, but camp and pka are involved [99,
100]. thus, a biological closed loop appears to exist that,
chronically, keeps intracellular camp concentration constant. indeed, the concentration of camp was normal in
myocardial biopsies from patients with heart failure
(compared to healthy controls), although norepinephrine
plasma levels were increased at the same time [101].

lessons from genetically engineered mice
answers to the question whether b-adrenergic desensitization should be considered mainly a ‘‘good’’ or a ‘‘bad’’
response in heart failure can also be derived from genetically engineered mouse models. in these mice, key
elements of the b-adrenergic signaling pathway have either
been overexpressed or deleted (table 1). a common feature is that augmentation of b-adrenergic signaling leads,
initially, to higher contractile performance. later in life,

229

however, overexpression of b1-ar, b2-ar (at high density,
differences between b1- and b2-ar overexpressors are
discussed in depth in refs. [53, 102]), gas, or pka causes
cardiomyopathy and/or arrhythmia, and premature death
[103–107]. b2-ar overexpression, despite augmenting
cardiac output under normal unstressed conditions, was
accompanied by exaggerated myocardial damage after
ischemia–reperfusion injury or pressure overload [108,
109]. similarly, deletion/inhibition of signaling elements
that dampen the b-ar signaling pathway such as the
inhibitory g protein, gai-2, resulted in worsened cardiac
phenotype when crossed with b2-ar transgenic mice [110,
111] or, in case of phosphodiesterase  xxxg1700xxx , in progressive cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias [112]. and
finally, deletion of the autoinhibitory a2c ar in mice was
associated with increased catecholamine levels, exaggerated fibrosis, and mortality after pressure overload [113].
the observation that the cardiomyopathic phenotype of
b1-ar and gas transgenics was prevented by the betablocker propranolol [114] substantiates that cardiac
pathology in these animal models is indeed the consequence of chronically augmented b-ar stimulation.
however, noteworthy exceptions exist. transgenic as
well as adenoviral overexpression of ac6 sensitized the
heart to catecholamines, but did not cause heart failure and
improved long-term function even under conditions of
cardiac stress [115–117]. similarly, conditional, heartspecific ablation of  xxxg970xxx  increased survival and function
after myocardial infarction [118]. a peculiarity of ac6 that
could explain the beneficial phenotype of its overexpression is that ac6 apparently has no intrinsic activity,
leading to normal camp-levels under unstimulated
conditions and ‘‘only’’ an increased response to catecholamines [119, 120]. the augmented dynamic range of the
heart could be beneficial in stress situations. moreover,
evidence exists that the beneficial effects of ac6 overexpression and  xxxg970xxx  inhibition may be, at least partially,
independent of the b-ar/camp pathway [120].
apart from the b1- and b2-adrenoceptor knockout mice
(recently reviewed in depth [102]), two genetically engineered mice exist, in which stimulating components were
deleted:  xxxg69xxx  [121] and phosphatase i-1 [122]. mice with
targeted ablation of  xxxg69xxx  have a normal cardiac phenotype, but were protected from heart failure after pressure
overload or long-term b-adrenergic stimulation [123,
124]. moreover, they show an enhanced lifespan (?30%),
likely due to protection from aging cardiomyopathy [125].
it is interesting in this respect that pmc-6, a pharmacological ac inhibitor that shows some selectivity for  xxxg69xxx ,
abolished pro-apoptotic effects of b-ar stimulation in
isolated adult myocytes, but not its effect on cell shortening [126]. this and the knockout data suggest that  xxxg69xxx 
may not be necessary for normal force regulation, but for

the proapoptotic effects of b-ar stimulation at high
concentrations.
mice lacking i-1 (i-1-ko) show normal heart structure
[37, 41] and mild desensitization, but unchanged maximal
contractile responses to b-ar stimulation [41]. similar to
 xxxg69xxx -ko, i-1-ko were partially protected from hypertrophic and proarrhythmic effects of b-ar stimulation [41].
on the other hand, overexpression of a truncated constitutive active form of i-1 (i-1*) showed a hyper-contractile
phenotype under basal conditions and improved function
after pressure overload [127]. interestingly, i-1* overexpression was associated with hyperphosphorylation of
plb, but not ryr2.
the mouse data created a paradox situation. whereas
one set of data argues for inhibiting i-1 to protect the heart
and delay the development of heart failure [41], another set
of data argues for a aav-mediated gene therapy approach
to overexpress i-1* as currently developed by r. hajjar
and e.g. kranias (personal communication). similarly,
one group is searching for  xxxg69xxx  inhibitors [125], the other
tests the therapeutic effect at ac6 overexpression [120].
it is not entirely clear how to integrate these apparently
opposing concepts. but several well-founded conclusions
can be drawn and hypotheses can be put forward that need
to be tested in the future.

a well-developed b-ar-mediated fight&flight response
is likely necessary for efficient compensation of acute
cardiac stress and for maximal exercise capacity, a reason
why the sympathetic system has developed during
evolution and why betablockers can have detrimental
effects when given routinely after myocardial infarction
[128].
on the other hand, there is little doubt, both from
clinical and transgenic experimental data, that chronically increased b-ar stimulation has detrimental
consequences on the heart.
at least three parameters are critical in determining
whether b-ar stimulation is beneficial or detrimental:
its intensity (‘‘dose’’), duration, and timing.
given these considerations, it seems very unlikely that
any element of the b-ar signaling pathway is just
beneficial or detrimental; it all depends on the situation.
this conclusion has several important implications: (i)
it calls for a pharmacological approach which can be
applied at the right time and the right dose, in contrast to
a gene therapy approach which delivers a protein at a
(partially uncontrollable) concentration and at all time;
(ii) the model one chooses to determine ‘‘therapeutic
effects’’ is absolutely crucial. transgenic mouse models
have been extremely helpful in identifying the general
function of a given protein, but fall short when it comes
to evaluating its therapeutic value in a chronic disease

123

condition. the same holds true for commonly used
mouse models such as transortic constriction where a
situation is created, which never occurs in humans.
whereas the generally accepted endpoint in patients
with heart failure is survival, most ‘‘therapeutic interventions’’ in mice are still studied a few weeks after the
intervention in terms of surrogate parameters such as
hypertrophy, cardiac dimensions or ejection fraction.
new interventions are almost never studied on top of
existing pharmacological therapy. finally, mice often
compensate deficits in cardiac performance simply by
not moving anymore. thus, better animal models are
needed and more care has to be invested in studying
therapeutic interventions in a ‘‘clinically relevant’’
manner; (iii) important answers will come from careful
(pharmaco) genetic studies (see below).
b-ar activate numerous downstream effector systems,
mediating the ‘‘normal’’ acute fight&flight response of
the heart, but also chronic hypertrophic, apoptotic, and
proarrhythmic effects. if these pathways differ qualitatively and not only quantitatively one could
specifically tackle those associated with cardiac
pathology. the differences in phosphorylation levels
of plb, tni, and cmybp-c on the one and ryr2 and
ltcc on the other hand, as well as the discrepant
results with  xxxg69xxx  and ac6 and i-1 and i-1* indeed
provide evidence for such compartmentalization.

genetic and pharmacogenetic aspects
both the susceptibility for the development of heart failure and its natural history are influenced by genetic
predispositions. a strong argument comes from genetically engineered mouse models in which the degree and
the time course of the heart failure phenotype of diseasecausing mutations are strongly depending on the genetic
background. an obvious candidate to explain such heterogeneity is the b-ar system and indeed, the two mouse
strains with different capacities to downregulate their
cardiac b-ar are an example [88]. however, the situation
in patients remains complex. it has been extensively
reviewed [129] and can be only shortly summarized
herein.
several elements of the sympathetic nervous/b-ar
system exist in genetically determined variants in which
amino acid exchanges at critical positions lead to differences in functions. the best-studied examples today are the
b1-ar arg389gly polymorphism, the a2c ins/del polymorphism, and the grk5 leu41glu polymorphism. they
are important for several reasons: (i) the minor alleles, i.e.
the ones with the ‘‘abnormal’’ function, are present in the
population at a relevant frequency (4–40%); (ii) the allele

123

frequency shows, in case of a2c ins/del and grk5
glu41leu, 10-fold differences between african americans
and caucasians, suggesting some evolutionary impact; (iii)
the functional differences in biological activity, studied
under controlled experimental conditions, are marked.
thus, the b1-ar with a gly in position 389 stimulates
camp formation 3–5-fold less than the arg389 variant
[130] and the a2cdel variant, lacking 4 amino acids in its
c-terminus, exerts largely less inhibition of camp-formation than its wildtype counterpart [131]. in contrast, the
leu41 variant of grk5 is superactive [89].
a prediction from the above discussed role of the
sympathetic nervous/b-ar system in heart failure is that
high-activity b1-ar variants (high postsynaptic activity),
low-activity a2c-ar (low feedback inhibition = high
sympathetic nervous system activity), and low-activity
grk5 variants (low desensitization under chronic catecholamine stress) are associated with higher susceptibility
for the development and faster deterioration of the clinical
course of heart failure. indeed, some evidence supports this
hypothesis, but some other does not [129]. for example, a
study in african americans showed that homozygous
carriers of the (rare) combination of b1-ar arg389 and
a2cdel variants were 10-fold overrepresented in a cohort
of patients with heart failure compared with a control
population (*20 vs. 2%, [132]). the low-activity grk5
glu41 carriers were not overrepresented in a cohort of
african americans with heart failure, but showed worse
survival compared to leu41 carriers [89]. both studies
need to be independently confirmed. on the other hand, the
only large prospective study performed until today did not
observe any difference in survival between homozygous
carriers of the high-activity b1-ar arg389 variant compared to those of at least on gly389 variant [133]. the
comparison between homozygous gly389 carriers with at
least one arg389 has not been reported.
a second prediction is that patients with high-activity
sympathetic nervous/b-ar system respond better to
betablockers. this has been shown for b1-ar arg389arg
carriers with regard to the non-conventional betablocker
bucindolol [133] as well for grk5 glu41glu carriers and
the betablockers carvedilol and metoprolol [89]. again,
data are conflicting [129, 134].
the discordant data have several possible reasons. (i)
the number of prospective studies with a pharmacogenetic
design and the numbers of patients/endpoints are clearly
too low to draw firm conclusions. thus, much of the discrepancy may just reflect statistical variability; (ii)
even the currently well-accepted beneficial effects of
betablockers needed [20 years to be substantiated through
large prospective studies; (iii) retrospective studies and
register data are complicated by the fact that betablockers
are increasingly prescribed. thus, if the response to

heart fail rev (2009) 14:225–241

betablockers is indeed determined by the genetic
predisposition, two opposing effects will obscure each
other. on the one hand, the natural course of the disease
will be worsened by a high-activity sympathetic/b-ar
system; on the other hand, the therapeutic effect of
betablockers will be better. thus, only controlled prospective studies will answer the question. a problem is that
such studies are presently not supported by industry. (iv)
finally, it is possible that high-activity variants not only
negatively influence the chronic phase of heart failure, but
are beneficial in situations of acute demand, such as large
myocardial infarctions. thus, it will be necessary to study
at more detail what outcome is associated with which
variant.

future therapeutic approaches involving
the b-adrenergic system in chronic heart failure
since the landmark studies of the late 1990s the betablockers
bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol (in its zok preparation),
and  xxxd2704xxx  are the mainstay of therapy of chronic heart
failure, together with ace inhibitors, aldosteron receptor
blockers, diuretics, and potentially cardiac glycosides. every
future therapy in this field has to be considered as an add-on
or an alternative to this drug combination. this raises the bar
for future therapeutic developments. indeed, endothelin
receptor antagonists [135], the sympatholytic compound
 xxxd2674xxx  [136],  xxxg2296xxx - and interleukin-1-antagonists
[137],  xxxg100xxx  antagonists [138], and statins [139], all
failed to provide relevant further improvements in the
prognosis even worsened it ( xxxd358xxx ,  xxxd2674xxx , etanercept). thus, new concepts are clearly needed.
refinement of betablocker treatment
probably the easiest and quantitatively the most-effective
improvement of heart failure therapy will be a refinement
of current concepts, namely treating more patients with
betablockers, prescribing optimal doses, and treating
subgroups differently. the first aim will be provided by
better heart failure programs, patient information, and
other ways to implement current guidelines (www.heart
failurematters.org). better dosing is an issue when considering current heart failure surveys [140] and the fact
that individual dose requirements differ considerably
[141]. the latter is at least partially due to the cyp2d6
gene polymorphism affecting metoprolol and carvedilol
plasma levels per dose by a factor of 5-fold [142] and
2–3-fold, respectively [143]. this translates in approximately twofold higher heart rate responses in cyp2d6
poor metabolizers (8% of caucasians, rau et al. 2008, in
press).

233

an interesting new experimental approach is based on
the observation that stimulatory autoantibodies against
b-ar can play a causative in heart failure [144]. inactivating peptides capturing these autoantibodies are currently
tested as a therapy in animal models (m.j. lohse, personal
communication).
downstream betablockade
betablockers are contraindicated in some patients, e.g.,
those with asthma bronchiale. in addition, it is not clear
whether all of the downstream effects of betablockade are
beneficial. therefore, new drugs that selectively tackle
certain aspects of the action of betablockers are interesting.
one such drug is the selective inhibitor of cardiac pacemaker channels: ivabradine. it reduces heart rate without
force of contraction and is currently marketed in europe for
the treatment of patients with stable angina not tolerating
betablockers. unfortunately, a recent trial testing ivabradine in patients with stable coronary artery disease and left
ventricular systolic dysfunction on top of betablockers
(87%) did not show an overall benefit in cardiac outcome,
despite a mean reduction in heart rate by 6 beats per min
[145].
two alternative concepts target other downstream elements of the b-ar pathway. ac 5 inhibitors would be
attractive, because ac 5 knockout mice showed improved
life expectancy associated with less signs of aging and
improved cardiac function under normal and stressed
conditions ([125], for further details see above). inhibitors
of phosphatase-1 i-1 would be interesting because i-1 ko
animals are partially protected from proarrhythmic actions
of catecholamines, but show a normal heart rate response,
likely because i-1 plays a role downstream of the action of
camp on the pacemaker channel [41]. whereas partially
selective ac 5 inhibitors have already been tested [146],
no compound is yet available to target i-1.
the resensitization concept
other groups currently test the effects of aav-mediated
overexpression of ac 6 or the grk inhibitor barkct.
this concept aims at restoring part of the signaling cascade
downstream of b-ar. it has proven successful in different
mouse models (see above) and even in a rabbit or pig
models [147, 148]. as discussed above, these a priori
surprising results may have to do with the lack of constitutive activation of downstream pathways, increased
dynamic range of regulation, and potentially also with a
selective activation of ‘‘beneficial’’ parts of the b-ar signaling pathways. an obvious limitation is the need for a
gene-therapy approach at this point.

123

234

the serca/plb concept
dysfunction of diastolic ca2? uptake into the sr is one of
the hallmarks of chronic heart failure. it is explained either
by a decrease in the protein amount of serca2a and/or by
hypophosphorylation of its inhibitor protein, plb.
decreased ca2? uptake can explain the prolonged ca2?
transient (and thus impaired relaxation) and participates in
decreased sr ca2? content (and thus reduced systolic
function) in heart failure (for reviews see [61, 149]). in
addition, decreased sr-based removal of diastolic ca2?
enhances arrhythmogenicity by shifting the transport to the
electrogenic ncx. these data form the basis of three new
experimental strategies—gene transfer of serca2a, the
effector protein itself, gene transfer of inhibitors or shrnas
against the serca-inhibitor plb, and gene transfer of
i-1* to increase the phosphorylation of plb (and thereby
release its inhibitory effect on serca2a).
an important cornerstone of this concept is that genetic
ablation of plb in mice chronically increased cardiac
output without signs of longterm pathology [20]. moreover, cross-breeding of the plb-ko mouse with other
models of heart failure rescued the phenotype in many [21,
150–152], but not all models [153–155]. gene therapy
approaches inhibiting phospholamban [156–158] or
directly overexpressing serca [159] ameliorated several
heart failure models in rodents (for reviews see [8, 53]).
recently, serca gene delivery (through aav1) has been
shown to improve contractile performance and myocardial
remodeling in a large animal model of hf [160]. and
finally, an aav-mediated gene therapy of a constitutively
active phosphatase inhibitor, i-1*, is currently developed,
based on the observation that transgenic mice overexpressing i-1* were partially protected against pressure
overload and showed increased phosphorylation of plb
[127]. collectively, these data indicate that an sr-targeted
approach does not simply mimic the effect of chronic b-ar
stimulation. the advantage is that contractile function can
be improved without increases in diastolic ca2?.
however, some data also indicate potential risks of
serca2a/anti-plb gene therapy: (i) transgenic
serca2a-overexpressing rats show increased mortality
due to ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to mi during
the 24 h [161]. (ii) we found recently that mice with
conditional, tetracycline-regulated overexpression of i-1*
showed not only increased cardiac contractility, but also
ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to adrenergic stress
(unpublished). (iii) two inactivating mutations in the plb
gene have been reported to cause dilated cardiomyopathy,
indicating that there are important differences between
mice and humans [162]. despite these concerns, the
serca-targeted approach is currently considered the safest ‘‘positive inotropic’’ intervention in heart failure and

123

heart fail rev (2009) 14:225–241

clinical trials testing serca2a gene transfer in patients
have been started [163].
an interesting related concept is the use of istaroxime
in acute heart failure, a compound that inhibits
na?/k?atpase similar to cardiac glycosides and, in addition, directly activates serca [164]. in a recent clinical
trial in patients hospitalized with heart failure istaroxime
decreased pcwp, increased systolic blood pressure, and
decreased heart rate [165]. the important question will be
how much of this action is due to the  xxxd2799xxx 
action and how much to serca stimulation.
the leaky ryr2 concept
besides the problem of the failing heart to pump ca2? back
into the sr, evidence exists that the sr of failing myocytes
also releases more ca2? during diastole via the ryr2 than
normal. ‘‘leaky ryr2’’ could explain less ca2? loading of
the sr, higher diastolic ca2? concentrations, and a higher
propensity for arrhythmias because the amount of ca2?
released has to be extruded from the cell via the electrogenic ncx [79, 81]. the latter is substantiated by recent
findings that mutations in ryr2 underlie catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [166–169].
despite some controversy as to the role of hyperphosphorylation of ryr2 at the pka site (2809; [80, 81]), most
would agree that compounds that ‘‘tighten’’ the ryr2 in
diastole would be of great potential value. for example,
tetracaine abolished spontaneous ca2? waves in isolated
myocytes under conditions of b-ar stimulation, but rather
increased electrically evoked ‘‘normal’’ ca2? transients
[170], thus providing a positive inotropic together with an
antiarrhythmic effect. studies with new 1,4-benzothiazepines (derivates of the ca2? channel blocker diltiazem) are
currently performed to test the therapeutic potential of this
concept [171].

conclusions
the treatment of heart failure has improved remarkably
during the past 20 years and betablockers had their due
share in it. the failure of many recent trials in the field
have created the feeling that the concept of neurohumoral
blockade has reached an end. yet, there is certainly room
for improvement, the surprising success of isdn/hydralazine in african americans [172] serving as an example.
progress will come from practical refinement of the current betablocker treatment including the identification of
subgroups of non-responders and super-responders to
betablockers by pharmacogenetics. to resolve this matter,
large prospective studies are absolutely essential and will
probably not be sponsored by pharmaceutical industry. on

heart fail rev (2009) 14:225–241

the other hand, the improved understanding of the role of
the b-ar signaling pathway in cardiac physiology and
pathology helped to identify several downstream elements
of b-ar that provide exciting novel targets for therapy.
