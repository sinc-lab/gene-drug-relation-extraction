pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

age and gender effects on the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
of  xxxd3078xxx , a hypnotic agent acting
via melatonin receptors mt1 and mt2
david j. greenblatt, jerold s. harmatz, and aziz karim

effects of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of  xxxd3078xxx , a hypnotic acting via
binding to melatonin mt1 and mt2 receptors, were evaluated in healthy young (18-34 years) and elderly (63-79
years) volunteers. part 1 evaluated the pharmacokinetics of
open-label oral  xxxd3078xxx , 16 mg. part 2 was a doubleblind, randomized, 2-trial crossover pharmacodynamic
study of 16-mg  xxxd3078xxx  and matching placebo.  xxxd3078xxx 
clearance was significantly reduced in elderly vs young volunteers (384 vs 883 ml/min/kg, p < .01) and half-life significantly increased (1.9 vs 1.3 h, p < .001). gender did not
significantly influence clearance or half-life.  xxxd3078xxx 
was extensively transformed to its hydroxylated m-ii
metabolite, with serum auc values averaging about 30
times those of the parent drug. compared to placebo,

 xxxd3078xxx  increased self- and observer-rated sedation, but
age and gender did not influence the magnitude of the
 xxxd3078xxx -placebo difference.  xxxd3078xxx  did not significantly impair digit-symbol substitution test performance or
impair information acquisition and recall. thus, the
reduced clearance and higher serum levels of  xxxd3078xxx  in
elderly subjects were not associated with enhanced pharmacodynamic effects. the usually recommended clinical
dose of  xxxd3078xxx  (8 mg) does not require modification
based on age or gender.

principal isoform mediating this transformation.
serum levels of the m-ii metabolite exceed those of
the parent compound by approximately 40-fold.6,7
absolute systemic availability of  xxxd3078xxx  is in the
range of 2%, probably attributable to extensive presystemic extraction.8 the apparent elimination half-life of
 xxxd3078xxx  is in the range of 1 to 2 hours, while that of
the m-ii metabolite is 2 to 4 hours. the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3078xxx  and m-ii are dose proportional in the dosage range of 4 to 64 mg.6
alterations in pharmacokinetics and intrinsic
sensitivity to hypnotic drugs in the elderly are issues
of ongoing medical and public health concern.9-13
increased drug sensitivity, together with reduced
metabolic clearance causing higher plasma levels,
collectively can underlie exaggerated drug response
in the elderly, leading to potential hazards of excessive or prolonged sedation, injuries due to falls, and
impairment of cognition and memory. such agedependent changes have been demonstrated for both

zolpidem14 and triazolam,15-17 2 extensively prescribed
hypnotics that act via the gaba-benzodiazepine
receptor complex and are partly or entirely dependent on cytochrome p450-3a ( xxxg590xxx ) isoforms for
metabolic transformation.18-20 concern also exists
regarding gender effects on hypnotic drug disposition and response,21-24 since sleep disorders are commonly experienced by women.
a potential benefit of  xxxd3078xxx  is that its sleeppromoting effect does not incorporate the typical clinical
sedative effects associated with gaba-benzodiazepine
receptor agonists. clinically important sedative and
performance-impairing effects of  xxxd3078xxx  are minimal even at doses as high as 64 mg.6,25 age-dependent
clearance decrements have been demonstrated for
other cyp1a2 substrate drugs such as caffeine and
theophylline,26-28 but the clinical relevance of such
changes, if applicable to  xxxd3078xxx , is not clear. the
present study evaluated the effects of age and gender
on the pharmacokinetic properties of a single 16-mg

486 • j clin pharmacol 2007;47:485-496

dose of  xxxd3078xxx  in healthy volunteers. although the
recommended clinical dose of  xxxd3078xxx  is 8 mg, the
safety and efficacy of both 8-mg and 16-mg doses have
been established during clinical development. the 16mg dose was used in the present study to increase the
likelihood that pharmacodynamic differences due to
age or gender would be observed if they existed.
methods
subjects
the study protocol was reviewed and approved by
the institutional review board serving quintiles, inc
(lenexa, kansas). a total of 48 male and female volunteers (44 caucasian, 2 african american, 1 asian, and
1 hispanic), aged 18 to 79 years, participated after giving written informed consent. of these, 24 subjects
(12 men and 12 women) were aged 18 to 35 years, and
24 subjects (12 men and 12 women) were aged 60 to

79 years. the selection of sample size was based on
clinical judgment rather than a formal power calculation. in previous studies of drug disposition in the
elderly,13-16,24 sample sizes in the range of n = 12
per cell have been sufficient to demonstrate agedependent changes in pharmacokinetics.
procedures
subjects participated in a 3-trial crossover study
divided into 2 parts. the first trial in the sequence was
the pharmacokinetic study (part 1), in which subjects
received a single 16-mg oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx , followed by blood sampling over the next 24 hours. part
2 (trials 2 and 3) was the pharmacodynamic phase of
the study, in which the same group of subjects received
placebo and 16 mg  xxxd3078xxx  in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. pharmacodynamic tests
were performed following active drug or placebo
administration, and blood was not sampled. seven
days elapsed between each of the 3 trials.
subjects were admitted to the study unit on the
evening prior to each trial. on the morning of each
trial, approximately 90 minutes before administration
of  xxxd3078xxx  or placebo, subjects ingested a standardized light breakfast with no caffeine-containing food
or beverages and no grapefruit juice. they fasted until
12 noon, after which they resumed a normal diet
(again without grapefruit juice or caffeine-containing
food or beverages).
pharmacokinetic study
for part 1 (the pharmacokinetic study), venous blood
samples were drawn from an indwelling cannula into
heparinized tubes prior to  xxxd3078xxx  dosage and at the
following postdosage times: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5,
2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours. samples
were allowed to clot, then were centrifuged, and the
serum separated and stored at –20°c until the time of
assay. urine was collected during the intervals 0 to 4,
4 to 8, 8 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours after dosage. volume
was measured, and aliquots frozen until assay.
pharmacodynamic studies
part 2 (trials 2 and 3) involved pharmacodynamic
testing. subjects’ self-ratings of sedative effects and
mood state were obtained using a series of 100-mm
visual analog scales.15,16,18,29,30 ratings of sedation
were also performed by trained observers, using the
same rating instrument, who had no knowledge of
the treatment condition. self-ratings and observer

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

ratings were obtained twice prior to medication
administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24
hours after dosage.
the digit-symbol substitution test (dsst) was
administered twice prior to dosing, and at the same
scheduled times corresponding to the visual analog
rating scales.15,16,18,29-31 subjects were asked to attempt
as many correct symbol-for-digit substitutions as possible within a 2-minute period. subjects completed
equivalent dsst variants, with no individual taking
the same test more than once.
acquisition and recall of information were evaluated using a word list free-recall procedure that was
administered at 1 hour after  xxxd3078xxx  or placebo
administration.15,16,18,29-32 sixteen words, taken from
4 different categories, were read in random order in
“shopping-list” fashion. subjects wrote down items
immediately after lists were presented. list presentation and recall were repeated a total of 6 times at 1
hour after dosage. at 24 hours after dosing, subjects
were asked to remember as many words as possible from the previous day’s list (delayed or “free”
recall).
analysis of data
serum and urine concentrations of  xxxd3078xxx  and 4
of its principal metabolites were simultaneously
determined by liquid chromatography with tandem
mass spectroscopy as described previously.6 the calibration range was 0.05 to 20 ng/ml for  xxxd3078xxx 
and 0.5 to 200.0 ng/ml for the metabolites. the
inter-assay coefficient of variation did not exceed
12%, and analytical recovery ranged from 90% to
103%. using a 0.3-ml aliquot of plasma, the lower
limit of quantitation was 0.05 ng/ml for  xxxd3078xxx 
and 0.5 ng/ml for metabolites; concentrations below
these limits were entered as zero.
the slope (beta) of the terminal log-linear phase of
each serum concentration versus time curve was determined by linear regression analysis. this slope was
used to calculate the apparent elimination half-life.
area under the serum concentration curve from time 0
until the last detectable concentration was determined
by the linear trapezoidal method. to this area was
added the residual area extrapolated to infinity, calculated as the final concentration divided by beta, yielding the total area under the serum concentration versus
time curve (auc). the peak serum concentration and
the time of peak concentration represented the rate of
appearance of drug in systemic circulation. apparent
oral clearance of  xxxd3078xxx  was calculated as the
administered dose divided by the total auc.

greenblatt et al

for self-ratings and observer ratings on visual analog scales, the 2 pre-dose baseline ratings were averaged, and post-dosage scores were expressed as the
increment or decrement relative to the mean pre-dose
value. scores on the dsst were analyzed similarly.
the word list memory test was analyzed as the mean
number of words remembered after 6 trials for immediate recall, and as the mean absolute number of words
correctly remembered for delayed recall.
for the visual analog scale and dsst variables, the
area under the 8-hour plot of effect change score
versus time was calculated to obtain a single integrated measure of pharmacodynamic action during
the period of greatest drug effect. for analysis of the
influence of age and gender, pharmacodynamic effect
areas in the placebo treatment condition were subtracted from values in the  xxxd3078xxx  treatment condition, thereby creating placebo-normalized effect areas.
statistical methods included student’s independent
t test, the kruskal-wallis test on rank-transformed
variables, or multiple regression analysis of ranktransformed variables.
results
study population
a total of 24 male and 24 female volunteers, aged 18
to 79 years, participated in the study (table i). all
study participants were ambulatory adults with
unremarkable findings on medical history, physical
examination, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead
electrocardiogram (ecg). one young woman took
oral contraceptives for birth control, and 3 elderly
subjects took thyroid replacement therapy for hypothyroidism during the course of study.
safety
all 48 subjects completed the pharmacokinetic portion of the study. three subjects were discontinued
after part 1 for administrative reasons or protocol violations. one other subject was withdrawn after part 1
because he experienced palpitations and ventricular
extrasystoles. these effects were not noted prior to
 xxxd3078xxx  dosing or at peak serum concentrations.
the intermittent ventricular extrasystoles occurred at
24 hours after  xxxd3078xxx  dosage, at which time the
serum  xxxd3078xxx  concentration was undetectable. the
90-minute episode of intermittent palpitations was
experienced on the third day after  xxxd3078xxx  dosage.
these events were mild and judged not to be causally
related to study medication. pharmacokinetic data

488 • j clin pharmacol 2007;47:485-496

for this subject were included in the analysis, but
the individual did not participate in further trials.
therefore, 44 subjects completed part 2.
adverse events were mild or moderate, and
reversible. the most common event was somnolence.
during the pharmacokinetic component of the study,
18 and 5 subjects reported mild and moderate somnolence, respectively. there was no apparent relationship between somnolence and systemic exposure to
 xxxd3078xxx . there were no serious adverse effects.
pharmacokinetics
structures, molecular weights, and in vitro  xxxg1476xxx  agonist activities of  xxxd3078xxx  and its metabolites
are shown in figure 1.
in all subject cohorts, there was extensive individual variability in pharmacokinetic variables for
 xxxd3078xxx . coefficients of variation in clearance
within each of the 4 cohorts averaged approximately
86%.  xxxd3078xxx  cmax and auc were higher, and
clearance lower, in elderly men and women compared to young subjects of the same gender, whereas
differences between men and women of the same
age group were small (table i). the kruskal-wallis
test indicated a significant difference between aggregated young and elderly groups in cmax, half-life,
auc, and clearance of  xxxd3078xxx . in all groups, oral
clearance values were very high, consistent with the
high presystemic extraction and low bioavailability
of  xxxd3078xxx .8
multiple regression analysis on rank-transformed
data indicated that age and gender collectively
explained a relatively small but statistically significant overall variability in each kinetic parameter,
based on the r2 values (table ii). age had a quantitatively greater contribution than gender to overall
variability.
total auc values for the m-ii metabolite exceeded
auc for  xxxd3078xxx  by approximately 30-fold (table i,
figures 2 and 3). half-life for m-ii was significantly
longer and auc significantly greater in the elderly
group compared to young subjects. multiple regression analysis indicated that age, but not gender,
explained a significant component of variability in
half-life and auc (table ii). serum levels of the m-i
and m-iv metabolites were similar to or higher than
those of  xxxd3078xxx , although not as high as the m-ii
metabolite (figure 3). age effects on m-i and m-iv
kinetics were similar to age-related changes in
 xxxd3078xxx  and m-ii disposition; because m-i and miv have minimal pharmacologic activity (figure 1),
kinetic data for these metabolites are not presented.

figure 2. arithmetic mean (± se) serum concentrations of  xxxd3078xxx  (left) and its m-ii metabolite (right) in healthy young and elderly
volunteers (n = 24 per group).

serum levels of m-iv were not high enough to allow
a formal kinetic analysis.
an average of less than 5% of the orally administered dose of  xxxd3078xxx  was excreted in the urine,
cumulatively as intact  xxxd3078xxx  or any of the 4
metabolites. most of this was accounted for by the
m-iii metabolite.
pharmacodynamics
differences between  xxxd3078xxx  and placebo in 8hour effect area for self-rated sedation reached significance for cohorts of young, elderly, male, and female

490 • j clin pharmacol 2007;47:485-496

subjects (table iii, figure 4). for observer-rated sedation,  xxxd3078xxx -placebo differences were significant
for the male subject cohort and the elderly subject
cohort (table iii, figure 4). for dsst scores, however,  xxxd3078xxx -placebo differences were small in
magnitude and not statistically significant (table iii,
figure 5).
to evaluate the effect of age and gender on sensitivity to  xxxd3078xxx , pharmacodynamic effect auc
difference scores ( xxxd3078xxx  value minus placebo
value) were calculated for each cohort. none of these
placebo-normalized scores was significantly influenced by age or gender. we note that the mean

oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  in 48 healthy volunteers.

pretreatment dsst scores for the elderly group
(50 ± 2) were significantly lower than for the young
subjects (68 ± 3) (figure 5).
serum auc values for  xxxd3078xxx , the m-ii metabolite, and for the sum of  xxxd3078xxx  plus m-ii were
evaluated in relation to placebo-normalized pharmacodynamic effect auc values for self-rated sedation,
observer-rated sedation, and the dsst score (figure 6).
none of the associations was significant, indicating
that systemic exposure to  xxxd3078xxx  and/or m-ii is
not predictive of the intensity of pharmacodynamic
effect.
the word list test of information acquisition and
recall demonstrated initial acquisition of 10 to 13 of
a possible 16 words on the list at 1 hour after dosage
in  xxxd3078xxx  and placebo conditions in all study
cohorts. there was incomplete recall at 24 hours
after dosage. the only exception was the elderly
male cohort. there were no significant differences
between  xxxd3078xxx  and placebo in either initial acquisition or delayed recall.
discussion
sleep disorders are prevalent in the elderly population, and hypnotic medications are commonly
prescribed for aging individuals with difficulty
sleeping.33-39 available prescription hypnotic medications have consisted largely of agents that produce sedation and sleep through interaction with the
gaba-benzodiazepine receptor complex.  xxxd2140xxx ,

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

marketed in the 1970s, was the first of the fullagonist benzodiazepine hypnotics to become available
in the united states.40,41 this drug received extensive clinical use, but its biotransformation to a long
half-life active metabolite, desalkylflurazepam,42,43
raised concerns regarding hazards of cumulative sedative and cognition-impairing effects associated with
multiple dosage, particularly in the elderly.43,44 in
the 1980s, hypnotic usage patterns shifted to benzodiazepine derivatives with shorter half-life characteristics, such as temazepam and triazolam.45 the
nonbenzodiazepine compound zolpidem first became
available in the 1990s and now is the most widely
prescribed hypnotic worldwide.46-48 although zolpidem and  xxxd2047xxx  do not have benzodiazepine
structures, their clinical action is nonetheless explained
by interaction with the gaba-benzodiazepine receptor complex.49-52
the use of short half-life hypnotics in clinical practice has reduced concerns regarding residual daytime
sedation and cumulative effects with repeated dosage.
still, clinical action through benzodiazepine receptor agonism inevitably brings the possibility of adverse
effects involving excessive sedation, impaired cognition and psychomotor performance, and impairment
of memory.51-55 furthermore, biotransformation of most
short half-life benzodiazepine-ligand hypnotics (triazolam, zolpidem,  xxxd2047xxx ) is mediated partly or
entirely by  xxxg590xxx  isoforms,18-20,56 of which expression
and function are reduced in the elderly according
to many studies.24 impaired metabolic clearance,
together with increased intrinsic sensitivity to
benzodiazepine-induced sedative effects, form the
basis for concern regarding the risk-benefit balance
for hypnotic drug therapy in the elderly.
the mechanism of action of  xxxd3078xxx  involves
interaction with melatonin mt1 and mt2 receptors
but not with the gaba-benzodiazepine receptor complex.5 in previous studies of healthy volunteers, residual sedation and impaired psychomotor performance
induced by  xxxd3078xxx  are essentially undetectable
even at doses as high as 64 mg.6,25 this suggests that
 xxxd3078xxx  may have potential advantages as a sleeppromoting agent for elderly persons.
the present study evaluated the influence of age
and gender on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single 16-mg dose of  xxxd3078xxx  in
healthy volunteers. as in previous reports,6 biotransformation of  xxxd3078xxx  to its principal metabolite
(m-ii) was extensive, with auc values for m-ii
exceeding those of the parent drug by a factor of
approximately 30. this is consistent with the low
oral bioavailability and high presystemic extraction

age and gender effects on  xxxd3078xxx 

figure 4. mean (± se) changes over baseline in self-rated sedation (top) and observer-rated sedation (bottom) in healthy young and
elderly volunteers following a single 16-mg oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  or matching placebo.

of  xxxd3078xxx .8 age significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3078xxx , with values of auc being
nearly 1.8-fold higher in elderly than in young volunteers and weight-normalized clearance in the
elderly reduced to 43% of that in young subjects.
this is consistent with published clinical studies
showing reduced clearance of other cyp1a2 substrate
drugs, such as caffeine and theophylline, in elderly
subjects.26-28 there also is experimental evidence showing reduced expression and function of cyp1a isoforms in aging fischer-344 rats.57 a similar effect of
age on auc was observed for the m-ii metabolite, as
well as for the m-i and m-iv metabolites.
the role of metabolites in the net pharmacologic
activity of  xxxd3078xxx  is not clearly established. m-i and
m-iii have both low serum concentrations and low
intrinsic pharmacologic activity (figure 1) and therefore are very unlikely to be of clinical importance.
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

systemic exposure to m-iv is higher than that of
 xxxd3078xxx , but the activity of m-iv is very low.
activity of m-ii is about 30-fold lower than that of
 xxxd3078xxx , but exposure to m-ii exceeds exposure to
 xxxd3078xxx  by a factor of about 30. therefore, it is possible that m-ii contributes to net clinical activity of
 xxxd3078xxx . although biotransformation of  xxxd3078xxx 
itself is highly dependent on cyp1a2, the mechanism of subsequent clearance of the 4 metabolic products has not been determined.
in contrast to the influence of age, gender did not
have a significant effect on the kinetic profile of
 xxxd3078xxx  or the m-ii metabolite. weight-normalized
clearance of  xxxd3078xxx  was 23% higher in women
than in men, but the difference was not significant.
compared to placebo,  xxxd3078xxx  produced significant increases in sedation based on self-ratings or
observer ratings. this is consistent with reports from
493

greenblatt et al

figure 5. mean (± se) scores on the digit-symbol substitution
test (dsst) in healthy young and elderly volunteers following a
single 16-mg oral dose of  xxxd3078xxx  or matching placebo.

safety evaluations, as well as the intended pharmacodynamic effect of the drug. however,  xxxd3078xxx 
was not significantly different from placebo in
terms of effects on dsst performance or effects on
information acquisition and recall. this outcome

contrasts with studies of hypnotics acting via the
gaba-benzodiazepine receptor complex, consistently demonstrating not only sedation but also significant impairment of psychomotor performance
and memory.13,15,16,18,31,32,49,58 also in distinction to
benzodiazepine agonists,13,15,16,43 sedative effects of
 xxxd3078xxx  in the elderly subjects were not greater
than sedation in the young cohort. thus, the higher
systemic exposure to  xxxd3078xxx  in the elderly subject
cohort was not accompanied by evidence of increased
pharmacodynamic effects.
the present study has limitations, in that it
involved only single doses of  xxxd3078xxx  or placebo as
opposed to multiple doses. also, the pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic components were done separately rather than simultaneously. finally, the dosage
of  xxxd3078xxx  was 16 mg rather than the usual clinical
dosage of 8 mg. nonetheless, the findings support the
safety of recommended doses of  xxxd3078xxx  (8 mg)
regardless of age, despite the reduced clearance and
higher serum levels of  xxxd3078xxx  in the elderly.
