corticosteroids are critically involved in blood pressure regulation. lack of adrenal steroids in
addison’s disease causes life-threatening hypotension, whereas glucocorticoid excess in cushing’s syndrome invariably results in high blood pressure. at a pre-receptor level, glucocorticoid
action is modulated by 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11b-hsds). 11b-hsd1 activates
cortisone to cortisol to facilitate  xxxg1601xxx  (gr)-mediated action. by contrast,
11b- xxxg1085xxx  plays a pivotal role in aldosterone target tissues where it catalyses the opposite
reaction (i.e. inactivation of cortisol to cortisone) to prevent activation of the mineralocorticoid
receptor (mr) by cortisol. mutations in the 11b- xxxg1085xxx  gene cause a rare form of inherited
hypertension, the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (ame), in which cortisol
activates the mr resulting in severe hypertension and hypokalemia. ingestion of competitive
inhibitors of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  such as liquorice and  xxxd433xxx  result in a similar but milder clinical
phenotype. epidemiological data suggests that polymorphic variability in the  xxxg1085xxx  gene
determines salt sensitivity in the general population, which is a key predisposing factor to adult
onset hypertension in some patients. extrarenal sites of glucocorticoid action and metabolism
that might impact on blood pressure include the vasculature and the central nervous system.
intriguingly, increased exposure to glucocorticoids during fetal life promotes high blood pressure
in adulthood suggesting an early programming effect. thus, metabolism and action in many
peripheral tissues might contribute to the pathophysiology of human hypertension.
key words: hypertension; cortisol; aldosterone; corticosteroid; 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11b-hsd); apparent mineralocorticoid excess (ame); liquorice; cushing’s syndrome.

hypertension has a prevalence of 20% in the general population and is a major risk
factor for cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. in the vast majority of
cases no underlying causes for the raised blood pressure are found and, therefore,
they are referred to as ‘essential’ hypertension. in contrast, ‘secondary’ hypertension
is defined by an identifiable cause and adrenal corticosteroids are now recognised as
playing a major role in this group.
cortisol is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the zona fasciculata of the human
adrenal gland, whereas aldosterone is the principal mineralocorticoid derived from
the zona glomerulosa. the implications of corticosteroid action on blood pressure
regulation are exemplified in pathological conditions of hormone deficiency and
excess. inadequate secretion of corticosteroids in addison’s disease causes lifethreatening hypotension, whereas states of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid excess
in primary hyperaldosteronism and cushing’s syndrome, respectively, result in high
blood pressure.
mineralocorticoid-based hypertension refers to a distinct entity of secondary hypertension defined by increased sodium and water retention by the kidneys resulting
in an expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment and suppressed plasma renin
activity.1 without a doubt primary hyperaldosteronism (see chapters 3 and 4) is
now recognised as the most prevalent cause of mineralocorticoid hypertension2,
but rarer acquired and inherited mineralocorticoid excess states unveil important
pathophysiological mechanisms that are involved in the much more prevalent form
of essential hypertension. this review focuses on the pre-receptor metabolism and
potential sites of action of glucocorticoids in blood pressure regulation.
cortisol metabolism
circulating cortisol levels are tightly regulated by the activity of the hypothalamoe
pituitaryeadrenal (hpa) axis in order to maintain cortisol homeostasis according to
physiological demands. at a cellular level, cortisol availability is modulated by two
isoenzymes of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11b-hsd1 and 11b- xxxg1085xxx .3,4
although both enzymes control the interconversion of biologically active 11hydroxy-glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents) to their
inactive 11-keto forms (cortisone in humans and 11-deyhydrocortisone in rodents),
they only share a 21% homology and have entirely different functions, substrate
affinities and tissue distribution (table 1).
11b-hsd1 is widely distributed but is most abundantly expressed in liver and fat
tissue.5 the enzyme preferentially utilises nadp(h) as a co-factor and is anchored
in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum with its catalytic domain protruding
into the lumen.6 principally the enzyme has bi-directional activities, capable of carrying
out both 11-oxoreductase (cortisone to cortisol) and dehydrogenase reactions (cortisol to cortisone) (figure 1). however in vivo, the enzyme predominantly functions as
an oxoreductase and consequently facilitates  xxxg1601xxx  (gr)-mediated
hormone action. very recently it was demonstrated that oxoreductase activity critically relies on high nadph concentrations as ablation of the hexose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (h6pdh) gene, which regenerates nadph from nadp within the
endoplasmic reticulum, results in a complete loss of oxoreductase activity and reversal
of its enzymatic activity from an oxoreductase to a dehydrogenase.7
11b- xxxg1085xxx  is a unidirectional, nad-dependent dehydrogenase inactivating cortisol
to cortisone (table 1). it is also located in the endoplasmic reticulum but, in contrast

to 11b-hsd1, its catalytic domain faces the cytoplasm and has a high affinity for its
endogenous substrate cortisol.8 11b- xxxg1085xxx  exhibits a distinct tissue-specific expression in classical mineralocorticoid target tissues, such as epithelial cells from the distal
nephron, colon and salivary glands, where it serves to protect the mineralocorticoid
receptor (mr) from cortisol (figure 2). in addition, 11b- xxxg1085xxx  is abundantly expressed
in the placenta where it protects the fetus from active maternal glucocorticoids.9
circulating concentrations of cortisol are 100e1000-fold higher than those of aldosterone but, paradoxically, the mr has similar affinities for its natural ligand aldosterone
and cortisol in vitro.10 thus, in vivo mr selectivity to aldosterone relies on the

figure 2. schematic depiction of aldosterone action in a mineralocorticoid target cell of the renal cortical
collecting duct. the  xxxg1602xxx  (mr) binds cortisol (f) and aldosterone (a) with equal
affinity, but plasma f concentrations exceed those of a by 100e1000-fold. selective binding and adequate
activation of the mr by a is ensured by the action of the enzyme 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 2 (11b- xxxg1085xxx ), which converts hormonally active f to its hormonally inactive counterpart cortisone
(e). upon binding of a to the mr, the mr-a complex translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where
it binds as a dimer to regulatory dna elements of aldosterone target genes. these events induce upregulation of the apical epithelial sodium channel (enac) and the basolateral naþ-kþ atpase. impaired 11bhsd2 activity results in insufficient inactivation of f and consequently f illicitly binds to the mr to increase
transcription of mr target genes resulting in increased sodium reabsorption from, and potassium excretion
into, the urine.

inactivation of cortisol to cortisone by 11b- xxxg1085xxx  at the pre-receptor level. aldosterone, in contrast to cortisol, is not metabolised by 11b- xxxg1085xxx  because it forms a
c11-c18 hemi-ketal group in aqueous solution.
in vivo, the global activity of both enzymatic reactions can conveniently be assayed
through an assessment of urinary steroid metabolites. following interconversion
of cortisol and cortisone, both steroids undergo a-ring reduction by 5a- and 5breductases and 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3a-hsd) to yield 5b-tetrahydrocortisol
(thf), 5a-tetrahydrocortisol (allo-thf) and 5b-tetrahydrocortisone (the) (figure 3a).
overall 11b-hsd activity in the body is reflected by the ratio of total urinary cortisol
and cortisone metabolites: [thf þ allo-thf]/the.

figure 3. a, schematic depiction of the enzymatic activity involved in glucocorticoid metabolism. cortisol
and cortisone are interconverted by 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11b-hsds). in the liver, 5a- and
5b-reductases and 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3a-hsds) convert cortisol to 5a-tetrahydrocortisol
(allo-thf) and 5b-tetrahydrocortisol (thf) and convert cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone (the). b, in normal subjects urinary excretion of cortisol metabolites (thf and allo-thf) compared to the cortisone
metabolite (the) is equivalent, resulting in a [thf þ allo-thf]/the ratio of 1. mutations that inactivate
11b- xxxg1085xxx  in apparent mineralocorticoid excess (ame) patients result in a grossly increased urinary excretion of thf and allo-thf compounds, whereas the is dramatically reduced, resulting in a high [thf
þ allo-thf]/the ratio.

the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess
clinical features
apparent mineralocorticoid excess (ame) is a rare form of hypertension; so far fewer
than 100 cases have been described worldwide.11,12 ame is inherited in an autosomal
recessive fashion and several families with affected siblings have been reported. presentation is usually during neonatal life or childhood with low birth weight, failure
to thrive, short stature, severe hypertension and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. hypokalemia may cause arrhythmia,  xxxg231xxx  and rhabdomyolysis.
in addition, renal cysts and nephrocalcinosis have been reported and may lead to renal
insufficiency. not surprisingly, profound hypertension, if untreated, results in damage
to end organs such as the kidney, cardiovascular system, retina and central nervous
system.13

laboratory findings
biochemically, blood test abnormalities comprise hypokalemia, suppressed renin and
undetectable aldosterone levels, hence the term ‘apparent mineralocorticoid excess’
was coined. the diagnosis is based on urinary cortisol metabolites, which show
a greatly increased [thf þ allo-thf]/the ratio of 8e80 (reference range 0.7e1.3)
with very low or absent levels of the clearly suggesting a defect in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity
(figure 3).12,14 interestingly, the excretion of 5a-cortisol metabolites exceeds that of
5b-cortisol metabolites, resulting in a high urinary allo-thf/thf ratio, which suggests
an additional defect in 5b-reductase activity.15,16 however, unless grossly abnormal,
the [thf þ allo-thf]/the ratio provides only an overall index of 11b-hsd activity
within the body, the main contributors being 11b-hsd1 in the liver and 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
in the kidney. thus it has been suggested that the urinary free cortisol to cortisone
(uff/ufe) ratio may provide a more accurate measure as it only reflects 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
activity in the kidney but not 11b-hsd1 activity in the liver.17 in ame the urinary
uff/ufe ratio is greatly elevated with virtually undetectable levels of ufe.17 furthermore, deficiency of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in ame results in prolonged cortisol half-life as a consequence of impaired conversion to cortisone.
although cortisol metabolism in ame is deranged, patients do not exhibit any cushingoid features and have normal circulating cortisol levels as a consequence of an intact
negative feedback mechanism. ame is caused by mutations in the  xxxg1085xxx  gene that
lead to partial or complete inactivation of the enzyme 11b- xxxg1085xxx . lack of 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
activity results in illicit activation of the mr by cortisol in aldosterone target tissues
rendering cortisol a potent mineralocorticoid in this condition.
a milder variant of ame (named type ii ame) has been described in several patients.18 these patients present later in life, typically in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a milder clinical phenotype of hypertension and hypokalemia. while the
urinary [thf þ allo-thf]/the may only be mildly elevated in comparison to type i
ame, the uff/ufe ratio and cortisol half-life is markedly elevated in keeping with a
defect in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity.19,20
therapeutic options
the principal aim of treatment in type i and ii ame is to control hypertension and correct life-threatening hypokalemia. dexamethasone has been used therapeutically as it
does not exhibit any mineralocorticoid activity by itself, yet effectively suppresses endogenous cortisol secretion. however, dose titration is important, as over-treatment
may lead to iatrogenic cushing’s syndrome. high doses of amiloride and triamterene,
both inhibitors of the mineralocorticoid regulated epithelial sodium channel (enac) in
the kidney (figure 2), may be an alternative option or can be used in combination with
dexamethasone. furthermore, the mr antagonist spironolactone has been used successfully, although high concentrations are needed to efficiently block cortisol binding.
however, other antihypertensive drugs may be required in order to achieve therapeutic targets. ‘cure’ of ame was reported in one patient following kidney transplantation
for end stage renal disease.21
molecular basis
at a molecular level the clinical and biochemical puzzle of ame was only resolved by
the discovery and cloning of the type 2 11b-hsd isoenzyme.22 the  xxxg1085xxx  gene is

cortisol metabolism in hypertension 343

6.2 kilo bases (kb) in length, located on chromosome 16q22 and contains 5 exons.23 at
present, over 30 different mutations have been defined within the  xxxg1085xxx  gene in
approximately 60 kindreds to cause type i and type ii ame (figure 4).11,24
in keeping with its autosomal recessive mode of inheritance most mutations causing
ame are explained by consanguinity, endogamy or a founder effect and, hence, are
found in a homozygote state.12,25e28 for example, three zoroastrian kindreds from
india and iran are all homozygous for the same mutation (r337d3nt;dy338). interestingly, six kindreds harbouring the l250p/l251p, r208c and e356,d1nt mutations are
of native american origin and it has been speculated as to whether a heterozygote
state may warrant a selection advantage. such individuals may have an increased ability
to hold onto sodium under conditions of extreme salt deprivation.12 not surprisingly,
only a few patients with compound heterozygote mutations have been described so
far, suggesting a low prevalence of ame mutations in the general population.13,29,30
missense mutations have emerged as the most frequent genetic alteration to cause
ame. such mutations result in single amino acid exchanges and impair catalytic activity
to variable degrees, whereas nonsense, frameshift and splice-site mutations typically
introduce premature stop-codons leading to a truncated protein with virtually no
enzymatic activity. regression analysis has established a close correlation between
the clinical/biochemical phenotype and underlying genotype: the greater the enzymatic impairment in vitro the lower the patient’s birth weight, the earlier the clinical
presentation in life, the lower the serum potassium level and the higher the urinary
[thf þ allo-thf]/the ratio.31,32 hence, ame should not be classified into the
more severe type i or the milder type ii form but rather be perceived as a disease
with a spectrum of clinical severity that is determined by the degree of 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
impairment.24
heterozygotes appear clinically normal, although experimental studies have
suggested that heteromeric 11b- xxxg1085xxx  formation may compromise overall 11b- xxxg1085xxx

activity. indeed, in one kindred, both heterozygote parents had evidence of mineralocorticoid-based hypertension, while in a second kindred the father of an affected
child was hypertensive and displayed an abnormal urinary [thf þ allo-thf]/the
ratio.32
inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  by  xxxd433xxx  and liquorice
for hundreds of years extracts of the liquorice plant (glycyrrhiza glabra) have been
used both as a sweetener in confectionery and as a herbal remedy. isolation of the active component,  xxxd2221xxx  (ga) and the observation that liquorice promotes
healing of peptic ulcers ultimately led to the development of  xxxd433xxx , an 18bhemisuccinate derivative of ga, which was used successfully in the treatment of both
duodenal and gastric ulcerations. however, both liquorice and  xxxd433xxx  induce
undesirable mineralocorticoid-like side effects including oedema, hypertension and
hypokalemia in up to 50% of patients.33 in the era of  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors (ppi),
 xxxd433xxx  is now rarely prescribed for the treatment of peptic ulcers but liquorice flavouring is still used in sweets in europe and in chewing tobacco in the united
states and sufficient quantities may lead to significant medical problems.34,35 although
ge has a very low affinity for the mr it is a very potent competitive inhibitor of 11bhsd2 with a ki in the low nanomolar range.8 consequently, administration of liquorice to healthy subjects leads to decreased levels of plasma cortisone, prolongation of
plasma cortisol half-life and an increase in the urinary [thf þ allo-thf]/the ratio in
vivo.36,37 beyond doubt, liquorice intoxication is now well accepted as the acquired
counterpart to the inherited syndrome of ame.
 xxxd2221xxx -like factors
interestingly, endogenous compounds exhibiting similar features to  xxxd2221xxx 
have been identified in partially purified urine extracts from normotensive men and
non-pregnant women and have therefore been named  xxxd2221xxx -like factors
(galfs).38 in pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimester, these compounds are elevated and, thus, it has been speculated that they may be progesteronederived metabolites. indeed, several galfs possess characteristics similar to those of
neutral steroids and steroid glucuronides.39 however, attempts to correlate indices of
mr activation or blood pressure levels with galf excretion have been negative.40
following extraction and chromatographic separation, galfs selectively inhibiting
11b-hsd1 or 11b- xxxg1085xxx  have been found. nevertheless, the exact nature of these
compounds and their biological significance remains nebulous.
ectopic  xxxg1801xxx  syndrome
patients with cushing’s syndrome secondary to ectopic  xxxg1801xxx 
(acth) secretion almost invariably (95e100%) develop a state of mineralocorticoid
excess defined by hypertension and hypokalaemic alkalosis. in contrast to ame, these
patients exhibit both high levels of plasma and urinary free cortisone, indicating that
11b- xxxg1085xxx  function is intact but saturated by the high substrate levels of circulating cortisol resulting in cortisol spill over to illicitly act on the mr. nevertheless, uff/ufe and
[thf þ allo-thf]/the ratios are dramatically elevated, reflecting the ‘relative’ incapacity of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in the presence of high substrate levels. although hypertension is

cortisol metabolism in hypertension 345

a common feature in other causes of cushing’s syndrome, uff/ufe and [thf þ allothf]/the ratios are only mildly elevated and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension in these patients remains poorly understood.41 the subject of
cushing’s syndrome and hypertension is discussed in greater detail in chapter 9.
essential hypertension
inactivating mutations in 11b- xxxg1085xxx , as well as competitive inhibition of the enzyme
by liquorice or  xxxd433xxx , lead to inherited and acquired hypertension in
humans. both forms are defined by a reduced activity of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  resulting in a
state of mineralocorticoid excess caused by insufficient protection of the mr in
the kidney. although patients with essential hypertension do not exhibit overt signs
of mineralocorticoid excess, blood pressure levels have been positively correlated
with plasma sodium and negatively correlated with plasma potassium levels, suggesting that adrenal corticosteroids may play a crucial role in its pathogenesis.42 thus,
the  xxxg1085xxx  gene represents a plausible candidate locus for more common forms
of hypertension and a number of studies have addressed the question of whether
mild deficiencies in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity caused by frequent polymorphisms may play
a contributing role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in the general population,
particularly in the subgroup of salt-sensitive hypertensive patients with low-renin
levels.
in a small caseecontrol study from scotland an increased half-life for 11-3hcortisol was found in hypertensive subjects, suggesting reduced 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity,
but no obvious differences in the urinary ratio of cortisol to cortisone metabolites
were detected.43 by contrast, a study from italy found an elevated urinary
[thf þ allo-thf]/the ratio in patients with essential hypertension44, but the high
prevalence of partially inactivating mutations of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in that community might
be a confounding factor.45 in a more selected hypertensive cohort, a higher ratio of
urinary cortisol to cortisone metabolites was only found in young men who had
a family history of hypertension, but not if parental blood pressure was normal.46
however, when looking at the urinary free cortisol to cortisone (uff/ufe) ratio,
which has been suggested to be a better indicator of renal 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity,
a higher uff/ufe ratio has been reported in unselected patients with essential
hypertension compared to controls.47
more recently, genetic studies have been performed with a view to find potential
molecular explanations for impaired 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in essential hypertension.
the first study reported an association with a microsatellite marker (d6s496) close
to the  xxxg1085xxx  gene in african-americans with end stage renal disease.48 in addition,
another polymorphism in exon2 (thr156/thr(c468a)) of the  xxxg1085xxx  gene was
found to be associated with high blood pressure47, whereas both association and linkage studies of a polymorphism in exon 3 (glu178/glu(g534a)) have turned out negative in essential hypertension compared to normotensive controls.47,49e51 however,
given that the reduction of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in ame is a paradigm for a salt-sensitive
form of hypertension, stratification of patients with essential hypertension according
to their salt status might be an important factor to consider when investigating
 xxxg1085xxx  loci. indeed, a microsatellite of ca repeats in exon 1 of the  xxxg1085xxx 
gene has been associated with salt sensitivity in both normotensive52 and hypertensive53,54 subjects, with shorter alleles being more common in salt-sensitive compared
to salt-resistant subjects. in keeping with a higher prevalence of salt-sensitive,

346 f. hammer and p. m. stewart

low-renin hypertension in blacks compared to caucasians, the same marker was associated with hypertension in this cohort but no linkage of hypertension to this locus
could be demonstrated.55
in summary these studies suggest that 11b- xxxg1085xxx  plays a contributing role in the
pathogenesis of essential hypertension. it appears that some of the identified polymorphisms are associated with essential hypertension per se, whereas others
seem to correlate with sensitivity to salt irrespective of blood pressure levels. undoubtedly, larger genetic and molecular studies are needed to better understand
phenotypeegenotype correlations and their clinical significance in the pathogenesis
of essential hypertension.
glucocorticoids and the cardiovascular system
vascular tone
in addition to their effects on fluid and salt homeostasis in the kidney, corticosteroids critically impact on vascular tone, an important determinant of blood pressure.
this is exemplified in addisonian crisis, where a complete lack of adrenal steroids
results in vascular collapse aggravating the fluid depleted state and thereby contributing to life-threatening hypotension. in animal models, intravenous administration of
hydrocortisone was shown to enhance vascular resistance in response to epinephrine, suggesting a permissive role of glucocorticoids for catecholamine action.56,57
in keeping with these findings, hydrocortisone administration in septic shock, an inflammatory state where relative adrenal insufficiency might be a contributing factor,
reduced the time to cessation of vasopressor therapy in humans.58,59
vascular tone is dynamically modulated by vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs)
according to their state of contraction. in vitro, glucocorticoids have been shown to
augment aortic contraction in response to catecholamines and  xxxg99xxx  by the upregulation of a1b-adrenergic and type i  xxxg99xxx  (at1) receptors in vsmcs.60e62
both grs and mrs have been identified by means of ligand binding and expression studies in vsmcs.63 the action of glucocorticoids in vsmcs, however, is modulated by 11bhsds at a pre-receptor level. both 11b-hsd type i and ii are expressed and functionally
active in vsmcs.64,65 if the conversion of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone
is blocked by  xxxd433xxx  or 11b-hsd1-antisense rna, aortic rings demonstrate an
attenuated contractile response to phenylephrine.66,67 conversely, incubation with
corticosterone and 11b- xxxg1085xxx -antisense rna compared to corticosterone alone
augmented contractile response to phenylephrine.67 the role of the gr and mr in
mediating these effects is unknown. in another study,  xxxg99xxx  binding was
shown to be increased when vsmcs were incubated with 11b- xxxg1085xxx -antisense rna
and cortisol compared to cortisol alone. only combined gr and mr blockade reversed
these effects completely, suggesting that both receptors are involved. incubation
of vsmcs with both corticosterone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone increased expression of the naþ/kþ-atpase, an important membrane protein regulating intracellular sodium and ph in vsmcs, whereas  xxxd433xxx  blunted the effects of
corticosterone.68
more recently, vascular endothelial cells (ecs) have been recognised as another
glucocorticoid target for modulating vascular tone. ecs release  xxxd2738xxx  (no),

in ec.69,70 in rats, inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  by  xxxd433xxx  results in hypertension
and impaired endothelial-dependent aortic relaxation. both effects could be reversed
by concomitant administration of mr antagonists, indicating that glucocorticoidinduced endothelial dysfunction is mediated through the mr.71 these findings are
supported by studies in 11b-hsd knockout mice. while 11b- xxxg1085xxx  knockout
mice exhibit endothelial dysfunction and enhanced norepinephrine-mediated aortic
contraction compared to wild-type mice, 11b-hsd1 knockout mice possess a normal
aortic contractory response.72 these studies suggest that pre-receptor modulation
of glucocorticoids in both ecs and vsmcs plays an important role in the regulation
of vascular tone.
heart
the heart is a corticosteroid target organ expressing gr, mr and 11b-hsd1.73 with
regard to blood pressure regulation no cardiac-specific glucocorticoid-mediated effects have been demonstrated but corticosteroids are critically involved in cardiac remodelling. inappropriate mr activation by aldosterone causes cardiac hypertrophy and
fibrosis. in keeping with these deleterious effects, conversely, mr blockade in patients
with acute or chronic left ventricular failure drastically reduces hospitalisation and
mortality.74,75 interestingly, in contrast to classical aldosterone target tissues, 11bhsd2 is not expressed in the heart and therefore the mr is permanently occupied
by cortisol and aldosterone accessibility to the mr remains a conundrum.76 however,
it appears that in the heart, unlike the kidney, glucocorticoid occupancy of the mr
antagonises rather than mimics the effects of aldosterone. this is strongly supported
by a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in cardiomyocytes
results in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and heart failure, presumably through augmented mr activation by aldosterone as a consequence of reduced occupancy by
cortisol.77 the physiological role of 11b-hsd1 in the heart remains unclear but no
obvious cardiac phenotype was reported in 11b-hsd1 knockout mice.78
blood pressure regulation by glucocorticoid
action in the brain
the central nervous system is another potential site of blood pressure regulation by
corticosteroids. selective activation of mrs in the brain by intracerebroventricular
(icv) infusions of aldosterone increases salt appetite and central sympathetic nervous
system drive to the periphery, thereby producing hypertension through multiple
mechanisms.79 by contrast, icv infusion of corticosterone alone does not alter blood
pressure but reverses aldosterone-induced hypertension, suggesting an antagonistic
effect of glucocorticoids.80 gr, mr and 11b-hsd1 are widely expressed in the brain,
whereas 11b- xxxg1085xxx  is expression is much more restricted.81 thus the majority of mrs
in the brain seem to be permanently occupied by glucocorticoids and only spatially
protected from glucocorticoids by 11b- xxxg1085xxx .82 however, cerebral 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity
is important for blood pressure regulation, as inhibition of cerebral 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity
by icv infusion or paraventricular injection of  xxxd433xxx  produces hypertension
and increased sympathetic drive, which is blunted by co-administration of an mr
antagonist.83,84 mr protection from corticosterone binding by 11b- xxxg1085xxx  has recently
been demonstrated by mr translocation studies in nucleus tractus solitarius neurons,

348 f. hammer and p. m. stewart

a brain region involved in salt appetite.85 in keeping with these findings, icv infusion
of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  inhibitors increases salt appetite, presumably by glucocorticoidinduced mr activation.86 these studies show that the brain is critically involved in
corticosteroid-mediated blood pressure regulation and suggest an important role
for 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in the regulation of salt appetite and sympathetic nervous activity.
glucocorticoids and intrauterine
growth retardation
one of the most striking observations concerning essential hypertension comes from
epidemiological studies that showed blood pressure levels in adult life correlated inversely with birth weight at term.87,88 these studies suggest that a suboptimal intrauterine environment secondary to nutrient and oxygen supply limitations during
critical periods of foetal life may lead to permanent alterations or ‘programming’ of
the developing organism which, later in life, increases the risk of developing high blood
pressure.89 animal studies suggest that foetal glucocorticoid excess leads to both intrauterine growth retardation and high blood pressure levels in later life.90 during normal pregnancy, the foetus is protected from the much higher maternal glucocorticoid
levels by placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx , which efficiently inactivates cortisol to cortisone in humans and corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents. in keeping with
these findings, treatment of pregnant rats with the 11b- xxxg1085xxx  inhibitor  xxxd433xxx , reduces birth weight and results in high blood pressure of the adult offspring.91e93 a common mechanism may underlie foetal programming through
maternal undernutrition and glucocorticoid exposure. dietary protein restriction during rat pregnancy selectively attenuates 11b- xxxg1085xxx , but not other placental enzymes.94
in humans, 11b- xxxg1085xxx  deficiency in ame results in severe growth retardation of the
foetus and very low birth weight of the newborn, presumably by trespassing of maternal cortisol onto the foetus. in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth
restriction, activity and expression levels of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in the placenta correlate
with birth weight.95,96 these studies suggest that attenuated 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in
the placenta results in increased foetal exposure to glucocorticoids and higher blood
pressure in adulthood.
the principal underlying mechanisms leading to foetal ‘programming’ of high blood
pressure remain unknown but animal studies have revealed permanent changes in
adult organs, such as brain, kidney, heart and vasculature, following foetal glucocorticoid excess. these effects comprise increased hypothalamoepituitaryeadrenal
drive, alterations of gr,  xxxg99xxx  and at1-receptor expression in the hippocampus, reduced nephron numbers and attenuation of vascular responses to
vasoconstrictors.90,97
