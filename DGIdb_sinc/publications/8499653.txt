abstract. by use of rat cdna probes and a panel of

cell hybrids segregating rat chromosomes, the genes
encoding three p y r i d o x a l 5 ' - p h o s p h a t e ( xxxd3047xxx )dependent decarboxylases--namely,
dopadecarboxylase (ddc),  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase 1
and 2 ( xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg850xxx )--were assigned to rat chromosomes (chrs) 14, 3, and 17, respectively. if one
takes into account chromosome localizations in the
human and the mouse, the present results (i) show that
a synteny group is retained on rat chr 14, human chr
7, and mouse chr 11 (ddc); (ii) strengthen the homology relation known between rat chr 3 and human and
mouse chrs 2 ( xxxg849xxx ); (iii) suggest that rat chr 17 has
no extensive homology to any human chromosome;
and (iv) suggest the order (prl, fdp)-tpl2- xxxg850xxx  on the
rat chr 17.

introduction

in vertebrates, the synthesis of several neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory compounds needs a decarboxylation step catalyzed by a group of pyridoxal 5'phosphate ( xxxd3047xxx )-dependent enzymes. these decarboxylases have distinct substrate specificities, but
share significant sequence similarities, leading to the
conclusion that they derive from a common ancestor
(jackson 1990).
 xxxg618xxx  (ddc;  xxxg618xxx ) catalyzes the decarboxylation of l-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan into dopamine and serotonine, respectively (christenson et al. 1972). ddc has been found
in a great number of neuroendocrinal tumors, in which
it constitutes a good marker of neuroendocrinal differ-

entiation (gazdar et al. 1985; nagatsu et al. 1985).
ddc cdnas have been cloned from diverse tissues
and organisms (ichinose et al. 1989; krieger et al.
1991; tanaka et al. 1989; taketoshi et al. 1990; kang
and joh 1990). great conservation is observed between their different coding sequences. in mammals as
in drosophila, ddc is encoded by a unique gene. partial determination of the gene organization indicates
that it is at least 40 kb long in the rat (hahn et al. 1991)
and more than 85 kb long in the human (sumi-ichinose
et al. 1992). the assignment of the human ddc gene to
chr 7 was demonstrated by bruneau and co-workers
(1990). in situ hybridization studies permitted its localization on 7pll-p13 (scherer et al. 1992; sumiichinose et al. 1992; craig et al. 1992), near the egfr
locus (lathrop et al. 1989). the mouse ddc gene has
been assigned to chr 11, band a (bruneau et al.
1992b), close to the erythroblastosis oncogen b ( xxxg682xxx )
locus, homologous to the human egfr locus (mfinke
and francke 1987).
in vertebrate nervous system, ~/- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) is the major inhibitory transmitter and is synthesized from  xxxd2431xxx  by  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad; ec 4.1.1.15). gad is the most reliable marker for gabaergic neurons. it is suspected to
be involved in the pathogenesis of seizure and movement disorders (houser 1991). gad has been identified as an autoantigen associated with stiff-man syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (baekkeskov et al. 1990). several immunological studies
suggested the existence of two related but distinct
gads in mammals (legay et al. 1986; katarova et al.
1990), and, indeed, two distinct genes,  xxxg849xxx  and
 xxxg850xxx , were identified in rat (erlander et al. 1991) and
human (karlsen et al. 1991). gads have specific subcellular localizations and are expressed at different ratios, suggesting a precise role for each of them (erlander et al. 1991).

 xxxg849xxx  was found mainly in brain. its cdna was
cloned from feline and rat brain c d n a libraries
(kaufman et al. 1986; julien et al. 1987), and a 3.7kbase mrna has been identified in the brain of cat,
rat, mouse, and human (kaufman et al. 1986; kobayashi et al. 1987). the cat  xxxg849xxx  cdna clone was
used as a probe to clone  xxxg849xxx  cdna in mouse (katarova et al. 1990) and human (bu et al. 1992). the
nucleotidic sequences of the cdnas are very similar.
the  xxxg849xxx  gene has been assigned to human chr
2q31 (bu et al. 1992). brilliant and colleagues (1990)
have shown that the gene encoding  xxxg849xxx  is located
on mouse chr 2 and suggest the existence of a
pseudogene on mouse chr 10.
 xxxg850xxx  was essentially found in mammalian brain
and pancreas [3-cells (baekkeskov et al. 1990; karlsen
et al. 1991). considered as a reservoir of inactive protein,  xxxg850xxx  is strongly activated by fixation of the cofactor, when gaba is required by the organ (martin et
al. 1991; erlander et al. 1991).  xxxg850xxx  is encoded by a
5.7-kb mrna in rat (erlander et a|. 1991) and in human (bu et al.  xxxd3528xxx ). in human,  xxxg850xxx  cdna has been
cloned and its gene assigned to chr 10 (karlsen et al.
1991; bu et al. 1992).
in the present report, we describe the assignment
of the genes coding for ddc, gad 1, and  xxxg850xxx  on rat
chromosomes and discuss their respective localizations in the human, mouse, and rat genomes.

rat x mouse somatic cell hybrids, which segregate rat
chromosomes.
as illustrated in fig. 1a, ecori digestion allowed
us to follow the rat ddc restriction fragments in the
hybrids: five rat fragments detected at 9.5, 7.8, 5.5,
4.7, and 4.3 kb could be distinguished from the mouse
fragments at 13.0, 5.7, 4.0, 3.7, 2.6 and 1.2 kb (three
other rat fragments, at about 3.7, 2.5, and 1.2 kb, had
sizes similar to those of mouse fragments and could
not be recognized in the hybrids). the five rat fragments cosegregated clearly in the hybrids, and the
comparison of the southern blot results with the rat
chromosome composition of the hybrids (table 1)
showed that the rat ddc gene segregated with rat chr
14. at least three independent discordant clones (out
of 12) were counted for each of the other chromosomes.
for the mapping of the rat  xxxg849xxx  gene, the restriction enzyme hindlii was used (fig. 1b). four rat fragments, at 11.0, 3.3, 2.1, and 1.5 kb, could be clearly
distinguished from mouse fragments at 9.5, 6.6, 5.5",
2.6, and 2.4 kb. as shown in table 1, the four rat
fragments cosegregated together and with rat chr 3. it
should be noted that, under the conditions we used,
our probe detected no additional or related sequences,
contrary to what has been observed in the mouse (brilliant et al. 1990). the rat genome, very likely, contains

c. vassort et al.: chromosome localization of three rat genes

only one gadl gene (see erlander et al. 1987). we do
conclude that the gene we detected and assigned to rat
chr 3 is the bonafide gadl gene.
the rat  xxxg850xxx  gene was localized with the enzyme
xbai (fig. 1c). again, multiple rat fragments (7.1, 6.0,
and 5.6 kb) could be distinguished from several mouse
fragments (at 16.5, 11.5, 8.8, 4.7, 4.2, and 2.3 kb), and
they cosegregated in the hybrids. one discordant
clone was found for rat chr 17, while at least five
discordant clones were obtained for each of the other
chromosomes. we thus conclude that the rat  xxxg850xxx 
gene maps on chr 17.
discussion

like the egfr (erbbl) gene, the rat ddc gene maps on
rat chr 14 (szpirer et al. 1991). the murine and human
homologs of these two genes reside on mouse chr 11
(band a) and human chr arm 7p, respectively (bruneau et al. 1990, 1992b; craig et al. 1992; scherer et al.
1992; sumi-ichinose et al. 1992; lathrop et al. 1989;
monke and francke 1987). these data thus show that
a synteny group is conserved on rat chr 14, human
chr 7, and mouse chr 11.
the gadl gene resides on rat chr 3 (this work),
mouse chr 2 (brilliant et al. 1990), and human chr 2
(sparkes et al. 1987; bu et al. 1992). the integrin ot4

c. vassort et al.: chromosome localization of three rat genes

( xxxg1203xxx ) and the  xxxg1069xxx  ( xxxg1069xxx ) genes also m a p on rat
chr 3 and h u m a n chr 2 (szpirer et al. 1992; spurr and
white 1991; chung et al., personal communication).
on the other hand, several m a r k e r s are k n o w n to be
shared by rat chr 3 and m o u s e chr 2 ( l e v a n et al.
1991; serikawa et al. 1992). our data thus strengthen
the h o m o l o g y relation b e t w e e n the rat chr 3 and the
mouse and h u m a n chrs 2.
i n t e r e s t i n g l y , the gene e n c o d i n g a n o t h e r p l p d e p e n d e n t d e c a r b o x y l a s e , histidine d e c a r b o x y l a s e
(hdc), and the [32-microglobulin gene (b2m) also m a p
on rat chr 3 and m o u s e chr 2 (joseph et at. 1990;
n a d e a u et al. 1992; sullivan et al. 1991), while in hum a n they are located on chr 15 (bruneau et al. 1992a;
donlon and malcolm 1991; n a d e a u et al. 1992; yasue
et al. 1992). the isovaleryl c o a dehydrogenase ( xxxg1216xxx )
and the neutral c a-glucosidase ( xxxg860xxx ) genes are also
located on rat chr 3 and h u m a n chr 15 (donlon and
malcolm 1991; szpirer et al. 1989; yasue et al. 1991).
a synteny group is thus c o n s e r v e d on these two chrom o s o m e s . several other m a r k e r s are shared b y mouse
chr 2 and h u m a n chr 15 (nadeau et al. 1992). taken
together, these data indicate that a synteny group,
containing the hdc and the b2m genes (and, probably,
the  xxxg1216xxx  and  xxxg860xxx  genes), is c o n s e r v e d on rat chr 3,
mouse chr 2, and h u m a n chr 15.
with respect to the  xxxg850xxx  gene, despite the discordant clone for the rat chr 17, our data assign this gene
to this c h r o m o s o m e . to our knowledge, the mouse
gene has not b e e n mapped. the h u m a n gene resides on
chr 10 (bu et at. 1992; karlsen et at. 1991). there is no
evidence for further h o m o l o g y b e t w e e n rat chr 17 and
h u m a n chr 10. the homologs of other genes residing
on rat chr 17 are dispersed on h u m a n chrs 1, 6, and 7
(acrm, prl, and tcrgcl, respectively; c o o k e et al.
1986; serikawa et al. 1992; yasue et al. 1992), as if this
small rat c h r o m o s o m e had no extensive homology to
any h u m a n c h r o m o s o m e .
finally, the fact that one of the hybrids we studied,
namely lb210-i, which lacks intact rat chr 17 or visible rat chr 17 fragment, is positive for rat  xxxg850xxx  gene
deserves some c o m m e n t s . other genes located on rat
chr 17 (like prl and fdp) are absent in lb210-i (cooke
et al. 1986; fulchignoni-lataud et al. 1992). on the
other hand, like  xxxg850xxx , the tpl2 locus, recently assigned to rat chr 17 (yeung et al. 1992) is present in
lb210-i cells. it is thus very likely that lb210-i contains a rat chr 17 fragment carrying  xxxg850xxx  and tpl2,
while other loci, such as prl and fdp (absent in lb210i), are located in another region of rat chr 17. in this
respect, s o m e data f r o m the hybrid subclones lb780-6
and lb780-8 are also relevant. indeed, these cells lack
an intact chr 17 but are positive for some of the genes
assigned to this c h r o m o s o m e (prl, fdp) and absent in
lb210-i (cooke et at. 1986; fulchignoni-lataud et al.
1992). in other words, this situation is opposite to that
of  xxxg850xxx , suggesting that lb780 cells contain a segment of rat chr 17 distinct f r o m that present in lb210i. f u r t h e r m o r e , the tpl2 locus was found in both
lb780 and lb210-i cells. this indicates that the chr
17 f r a g m e n t s p r e s e n t in e i t h e r the lb780 or the
lb210-i cells do overlap and share a c o m m o n region,

205
which includes the tpl2 locus. m o r e i m p o r t a n t l y ,
these considerations allow us to suggest the following
gene order on rat chr 17: (prl, fdp)-tpl2- xxxg850xxx .
