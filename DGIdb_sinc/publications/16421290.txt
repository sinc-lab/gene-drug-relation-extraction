the synthesis and antiviral activity of 1-␤-d-ribofuranosyl1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (ribavirin) was first reported in
the early seventies (sidwell et al., 1972; witkowski et al.,
1972). at the outset, inosine 5⬘-monophosphate (imp) dehydrogenase, a cellular enzyme that converts imp to xanthosine 5⬘-monophosphate in the de novo synthesis pathway of
gmp, was shown to be inhibited by ribavirin 5⬘-monophosphate (streeter et al., 1973). the subsequent depletion of
intracellular gtp pools, thus compromising the supply of
this nucleotide for the synthesis of progeny viral rna, provided a reasonable explanation for the broad-spectrum antirna virus activity of ribavirin. ribavirin-resistant sindbis
virus was shown to contain mutations in the viral guanylyltransferase gene that increased the affinity of this enzyme

furanosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (eicar) (the 5-ethynyl analog of ribavirin), or  xxxd2678xxx  (mpa; a compound that
exclusively inhibits impdh). the reduction in infectious virus
yield brought about by ribavirin (as well as mpa and eicar)
was paralleled by a similar reduction in viral rna yield; in case
of error-prone replication, the infectious virus yield is expected
to decrease significantly faster than the viral rna yield. in
addition, pre-extinction populations of the virus that has suffered a maximum impact of treatment with ribavirin did not
accumulate an increased number of mutations. very similar
observations were obtained with eicar and with mpa, a molecule that cannot be incorporated into viral rna. these data
thus allow us to conclude that the in vitro anti-yellow fever virus
activity of ribavirin is independent of error-prone replication.

for gtp. as a consequence, the drug-resistant sindbis virus
was shown to replicate efficiently in cells with low intracellular gtp concentrations, either induced by ribavirin or by
other imp dehydrogenase inhibitors (malinoski and stollar,
1981; scheidel and stollar, 1991).
later, several other mechanisms were reported that may
contribute to the antiviral activity of ribavirin. these are inhibition of 1) vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase by ribavirin-5⬘triphosphate (tp) (goswami et al., 1979; bougie and bisaillon,
2004), 2) influenza virus rna-dependent rna polymerase by
ribavirin-5⬘-tp (eriksson et al., 1977), 3) reovirus helicase by
ribavirin 5⬘-tp (rankin et al., 1989), and 4) dengue virus methyltransferase by ribavirin 5⬘-tp (benarroch et al., 2004). poliovirus rna-dependent rna polymerase was shown to incorporate ribavirin opposite to cytidine and uridine (crotty et al.,
2000), and poliovirus, which was cultured in the presence of
high concentrations of ribavirin (1 mm), accumulated 10-fold
more mutations in its genome than virus grown in untreated
cultures (crotty et al., 2001). accumulation of (a number of)
lethal mutations was shown to result in reduced infectivity of
the poliovirus population, a process called error catastrophe

abstract
the precise mechanism by which the broad-spectrum antirna virus agent ribavirin elicits its in vitro antiviral effect has
remained a matter of debate. we have demonstrated that inhibition of cellular  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase
(impdh) activity, and thus depletion of intracellular gtp pools,
is the predominant mechanism by which ribavirin inhibits the
replication of four flavi- and two paramyxoviruses (j virol 79:
1943–1947, 2005). as a consequence, induction of error catastrophe, which has been proposed as a mechanism by which
ribavirin may elicit its anti-rna virus activity, may be expected
to have little, if any, impact on its antiviral effect. the flavivirus
yellow fever virus (17d vaccine strain) was cultured for five
consecutive passages in the presence of 1-␤-d-ribofuranosyl1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (ribavirin), 5-ethynyl-1-␤-d-ribo-

materials and methods
compounds, cells, and virus. ribavirin ( xxxd3111xxx ) was purchased from valeant pharmaceuticals international (costa mesa,
ca), eicar was kindly provided by dr. a. matsuda (hokkaido
university, sapporo, japan), and  xxxd2678xxx  [6-(4-hydroxy6-methoxy-7-methyl-3-oxo-5-phthalanyl)-4-methyl-4-hexenoic acid]
was purchased from sigma (bornem, belgium). vero (african green
monkey kidney) cells were used throughout the experiments. yellow
fever virus 17d vaccine strain (stamaril; aventis pasteur msd,
brussels, belgium) was passaged once in vero cells to prepare a
working virus stock and was stored at ⫺80°c until used.
titration for infectious virus content. one-day-old confluent
vero cell monolayers grown in 96-well trays were infected with 5-fold
serial dilutions of supernatant samples harvested at 5 days postinfection from infected cell cultures. each titration was performed in
sextuplicate. after incubation for 6 days at 37°c (5% co2 atmosphere, 99% relative humidity), cells were fixed with 70% ethanol
and stained overnight with 2% giemsa’s azur eosin  xxxd2610xxx 
solution (merck, darmstadt, germany). cultures were examined
microscopically for cytopathic effects. the 50% cell culture infective
dose (ccid50) was determined according to the method of reed and
muench (1938). the detection limit of this method was determined to
be 1.25 ccid50/ml.
quantitation of viral rna load. total rna was extracted
from 150 ␮l of cell culture supernatant according to the manufacturer’s instructions (nucleospin rna virus kit; machery-nagel, düren,
germany). a one-step quantitative rt-pcr was performed in a
25-␮l reaction mix (one-step reverse transcriptase qpcr master
mix; eurogentec, seraing, belgium) using the following primers and
probe: forward primer (900 nm final concentration), 5⬘-tgg cat
att cca gtc aac ctt ct-3⬘; reverse primer (900 nm), 5⬘-gaa
gcc caa gat gga atc aac t-3⬘; and 5-carboxyfluorescein-mgb
probe (200 nm), 5⬘-ttc cac aca atg tgg cat g-3⬘ on an
sds7000 (applied biosystems, lennik, belgium). the standard
curve for absolute quantitation of yfv rna consisted of a 10-fold
dilution series of a template sample with known quantity. data are
expressed in rna copies per milliliter. the detection limit of the
rt-qpcr in this experimental setup was determined to be 111 rna
copies/ml.
serial passage of yfv in the presence of ribavirin, eicar,
and mpa. vero cells were seeded in 96-well trays in cell growth
medium (minimum eagle’s medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf
serum, 0.29 mg/ml glutamine, and 0.075% bicarbonate). twenty-four
hours later, medium was removed from the confluent monolayers
and replaced by 100 ␮l of assay medium (minimum eagle’s medium,
2% fcs, 0.29 mg/ml glutamine, and 0.075% bicarbonate) either or

not containing serial dilutions of compound at a 2 times concentration. subsequently, the cultures were infected with 100 ␮l of virus
inoculum (⬃1.350 ccid50/well) of the reference virus. each treatment condition was carried out in quadruplicate on two separate
96-well trays per experiment and in two independent experiments.
after a 1-h incubation period, culture supernatant was removed. the
monolayers were washed three times with warm assay medium to
remove nonadsorbed virus. then, cultures were further incubated in
the absence or presence of serial dilutions of the compounds for 5
days. at 5 days postinfection, the first signs of cytopathic effect
became visible in the virus control (vc) condition, and the infectious
virus yield in the culture supernatant was at that time comparable
with that of the original virus inoculum. the supernatant of four
replicate wells per plate was collected and pooled; 150 ␮l was stored
at ⫺80°c for later use in rt-qpcr, 6 ⫻ 25 ␮l was immediately used
for titration for infectious virus content, and 20 ␮l was used as
inoculum for the subsequent serial passage (at a dilution of 1/1000)
in the absence or presence of compound. the remaining volume was
stored at ⫺80°c for sequencing. the entire protocol was repeated for
five successive passages.
statistical analysis. the ratio of ccid50/ml to rna copies per
milliliter was compared among the four conditions (virus control,
ribavirin, eicar, and mpa) using a kruskal-wallis test. pairwise
comparison of these data sets was performed using the wilcoxon test.
a linear regression model was used to assess whether a correlation
exists between rna copies per milliliter and ccid50/ml for the four
conditions. all statistical tests were performed using sas software
version 9 (sas institute, tervuren, belgium).
mutation analysis. total rna was extracted from the culture
supernatant, and viral rna yield was quantified using rt-qpcr.
samples were selected based on the following criteria: 1) the virus in
the sample should have been replicating for at least one passage in
the presence of compound, 2) the virus should be undetectable (by
rt-qpcr or titration) after one extra passage in the presence of the
compound (⫽pre-extinction virus population), and 3) an equivalent
sample (i.e., same passage number) should be available for all three
of the treatment conditions. the rna template concentration was
normalized so that an identical rna input (1000 rna copies) was
used for the subsequent rt-pcr reaction. the rt-pcr reaction
was performed using the one-step rt-pcr kit (qiagen, leusden,
the netherlands) in a 50-␮l reaction mix: 14 ␮l of water, 10 ␮l of 5⫻
buffer, 2 ␮l of dntp, 2 ␮l of enzyme mix, 1 ␮l of rnasin (promega,
leiden, the netherlands), 0.5 ␮l of forward primer (60 ␮m; 5⬘-ctg
tga gct tcc atg gta  xxxg889xxx  at-3⬘), 0.5 ␮l of reverse primer (60
␮m; 5⬘-cag aga tgg aga ctc ata cta c-3⬘), and 20 ␮l of rna
template. the following thermocycling profile was used: 30 min at
50°c, 15 min at 95°c, 30 cycles of 20 s at 94°c, 30 s at 55°c, 150 s at
72°c (extended by 5 s per cycle), and final extension for 10 min at
72°c. because of the very low rna template input, no amplicon
(expected to be 2.591 nt) was visible after agarose gel electrophoresis.
therefore, the one-step rt-pcr reaction was used as template (5 ␮l)
for an inner pcr using the accuprime kit (invitrogen, merelbeke,
belgium) in a 50-␮l reaction mix: 39.1 ␮l of water, 5 ␮l of 10⫻ buffer,
0.25 ␮l of inner forward primer (60 ␮m; 5⬘-caa gga cac ctc cat
gca gaa ga-3⬘), and 0.25 ␮l of inner reverse primer (60 ␮m;
5⬘-cct aac tta cag gat gtt gga acc-3⬘). the following thermocycling profile was used: 2 min at 95°c, 30 cycles of 15 s at 95°c,
30 s at 55°c, 80 s at 68°c (extended by 3 s per cycle), and final
extension for 10 min at 68°c. the amplified 1.344-nt fragment was
purified by gel extraction (qiaquick gel extraction kit; qiagen).
after a-tailing with supertaq (sphaero q, gorinchem, the netherlands) for 15 min at 72°c, the fragment was cloned into pcr-topo
(topo cloning kit for sequencing; invitrogen), and transformed into
one shot chemically competent cells. for each of the selected samples, at least 23 positive clones were selected, and plasmid dna was
extracted using the wizard plus miniprep dna purification system
(promega). plasmid inserts were sequenced using the forward and
reverse primer designed for the rt-qpcr described above (bigdye

(crotty et al., 2001). a single mutation (g64s) in the poliovirus
rna-dependent rna polymerase gene was found to increase
the fidelity of the enzyme and to render the virus less susceptible to the mutagenic effect of ribavirin (pfeiffer and kirkegaard, 2003).
it remains unclear to what extent each of these different
mechanisms contributes to the actual antiviral effect of ribavirin. we have demonstrated that depletion of intracellular
gtp pools in cell culture caused by ribavirin closely correlates with inhibition of the replication of (four different)
flaviviruses (and two paramyxoviruses) (leyssen et al.,
2005). day and colleagues recently presented evidence that
both inhibition of the impdh and error-prone replication
contribute to the antiviral effect of ribavirin against west
nile virus (wnv) replication in hela cells (day et al., 2005).
the present study was designed to explore whether errorprone replication contributes to the in vitro antiviral activity
of ribavirin against the yellow fever virus (yfv).

results

5-fold higher concentration (12.5 ␮g/ml), viral replication was
cleared after three passages (fig. 1, b and e). as little as 1.25
␮g/ml mpa was needed to abolish viral replication in three
passages (fig. 1, c and f). overall, mpa proved to be more
potent than eicar, which in turn was more effective than
ribavirin in clearing virus replication. when the effects of the
respective compounds on both viral rna yield and infectious
virus yield were compared, almost identical profiles were
observed for each compound at any particular concentration.
statistical analysis of the effect of treatment on
yfv viability. for each single sample of the experiments
depicted in fig. 1 (a–f), the infectious virus titer (ccid50 per
milliliter) and viral rna yield (rna copies per milliliter) was
quantified. in such case that a compound would cause errorprone replication, the ratio of infectious virus yield to viral
rna yield is expected to be lower than this ratio in culture
supernatant samples obtained from untreated infected cultures.
for the untreated control cultures as well as for each of the
treated cultures, the log10 ccid50/ml was plotted against the
corresponding log10 rna copies per milliliter (fig. 2). linear
correlations were obtained [virus control: r2 ⫽ 0.938 (fig.

effect of antiviral drugs on viral replication during
successive passage of yfv. yfv was allowed to replicate
for five consecutive passages in the presence of 2.4 (data not
shown), 12, or 60 ␮g/ml ribavirin (fig. 1, a and d). none of
these concentrations of ribavirin resulted in a reduction of
infectious virus or viral rna yield compared with the untreated virus control condition (fig. 1, a and d). replication
of yfv in the presence of ribavirin at concentrations of 120,
180, 240, or 300 ␮g/ml resulted in a dose-dependent decrease
of infectious virus yield and viral rna load (fig. 1, a and d).
consecutive passages of virus in the presence of the drug at
the indicated concentrations (120, 180, 240, or 300 ␮g/ml)
ultimately resulted in viral extinction. the higher the concentrations of compound used, the fewer passages were
needed to completely abolish viral replication.
comparable observations were made with eicar and
mpa. a concentration of 2.5 ␮g/ml eicar resulted in complete extinction of viral replication at the fifth passage; at a

eicar or mpa) contained an increased number of mutations
in the genome compared with untreated virus. for each compound, one sample, containing a pre-extinction virus population, was selected for such analysis (the conditions marked
with an arrow in fig. 1). for these conditions, infectious virus
yield and viral rna yield was reduced by at least 2 log10, and
one extra passage in the presence of the compound resulted
in complete extinction of viral replication.
for each sample, at least 23 different clones were generated and sequenced. this represents a total of more than
30,000 nt per sample (table 1, a). furthermore, 1) the total
number of mutations compared with the yfv 17d consensus
sequence (genbank no. x03700) (table 1, b), 2) the number
of clones with a unique set of mutations (table 1, d) as well
as 3) the total number of unique mutations (table 1, e) were
determined. in the ribavirin-treated virus sample, but also in
the eicar-treated virus sample, each time two deletion mutants were detected, which were different for both conditions
(data not shown).
the frequency of the total number of mutations per 1000 nt
(table 1, c) as well as that of unique mutations per 1000 nt
in unique clones (table 1, f) was calculated. when the mutation frequencies of the different treatment conditions were
compared with that of the in parallel cultured untreated
virus (virus control), very comparable results were obtained
(table 1, c and f). only the eicar condition (analysis of the
total number of mutations; table 1, c) showed a 1.14-fold
increase in mutation frequency. the mutation frequency of

made, it was evident that these correlations were not dependent on the passage number at which the samples were
collected or on the concentration of compound at which the
virus was cultured (data not shown).
to allow detailed statistical analysis, the ratio ccid50 per
milliliter to rna copies per milliliter was calculated for each
supernatant sample. a kruskal-wallis test was performed on
all data sets simultaneously, and a p value of ⬍0.0001 was
obtained, which indicates that a statistically significant difference exists between at least two (not yet specified) data
sets. therefore, a two-sided wilcoxon test was used for pairwise comparison of the four data sets. a statistically significant difference was calculated when either one of the treatment conditions (ribavirin, eicar, or mpa) was compared
with the untreated virus control (p ⫽ 0.0003, 0.0005, and
⬍0.0001, respectively). the median of the untreated virus
control was 0.029 (ratio ccid50 per milliliter to rna copies
per milliliter); for the treatment conditions (ribavirin, eicar, and mpa, respectively), medians of 0.072, 0.073, and
0.117 were calculated. the different treatment conditions did
not differ significantly from each other (data not shown),

discussion
depending on the virus studied, ribavirin, a compound
that is extensively used in the clinical setting, has been
suggested to exert its antiviral activity through various
mechanisms (eriksson et al., 1977; goswami et al., 1979;
rankin et al., 1989; benarroch et al., 2004; bougie and bisaillon, 2004). a few years ago, evidence was provided that
ribavirin exerts its activity against poliovirus by induction of
an increased mutation frequency (10- to 13-fold) in virus
grown in the presence of the drug (crotty et al., 2001). ribavirin was shown to base-pair with cytidine and uridine,
which was suggested to result in a specific increase in c-to-u
and g-to-a mutations (crotty et al., 2000). such accumulation of mutations would result in reduced infectivity/viability
of the progeny virus, in a process called error catastrophe
(crotty et al., 2001). error catastrophe has been proposed to
be involved in the antiviral activity of ribavirin against hantaan virus replication (severson et al., 2003) as well as the
replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus (airaksinen et al.,
2003; pariente et al., 2003), gb virus b (lanford et al., 2001),
and recently also the replication of the flavivirus west nile
virus (day et al., 2005). however, ribavirin-enhanced lethal
mutagenesis was reported not to be the mechanism of action
against sindbis virus (scheidel et al., 1987; scheidel and
stollar, 1991) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (ruizjarabo et al., 2003).
in this study, we examined whether a decrease in infectious yfv production, brought about by ribavirin, was par-

alleled by a concomitant decrease in viral rna yield. in
addition, we investigated whether yfv, when cultured in the
presence of concentrations of ribavirin that had a major
impact on viral replication, did or did not accumulate significantly more mutations than virus passaged in the absence of
the compound. the antiviral effect of ribavirin was compared
with that of mpa and eicar.  xxxd2678xxx  is a nonnucleoside inhibitor that potently inhibits impdh (by interacting with its coenzyme nad⫹) and that has excellent antiflavivirus activity in cell culture. as a non-nucleoside
compound, mpa cannot be incorporated into viral rna. eicar is the 5-ethynyl analog of ribavirin that is approximately 25-fold more effective in cell culture against flaviviruses than ribavirin (neyts et al., 1996; leyssen et al., 2000,
2005). eicar 5⬘-monophosphate in turn is approximately
25-fold more potent than ribavirin 5⬘-monophosphate as an
inhibitor of impdh (balzarini et al., 1993, 1998; leyssen et
al., 2005). as a nucleoside analog, eicar 5⬘-triphosphate
may possibly have (akin to ribavirin 5⬘-triphosphate) the
potential to be incorporated into viral rna.
reduction of infectious virus yield by ribavirin was paralleled by a concomitant reduction in total viral rna load.
similar observations were made for eicar and for mpa.
ultimately, antiviral treatment with either compound resulted in complete extinction of viral replication. analysis of
the ratios infectious virus to viral rna yield did not reveal
statistically significant differences between the various
treatment conditions. only when the untreated virus control
was compared with any of the treatment conditions could a
statistically significant difference be calculated. this can be
explained because untreated cultures exhibited cytopathic
effect (cpe) at the time of collection of supernatant samples,
whereas only minimal cpe was observed in ribavirin- and
eicar-treated cell cultures, and no cpe was detectable in
the mpa-treated cell cultures. cell destruction (caused by
cpe) results in the release, for example, of immature virus
particles. that both the ribavirin- and eicar-treated cell
cultures showed some minor degree of cpe, whereas the
mpa-treated cultures did not, may also explain why the p
values are on the verge of significance when a statistical
analysis was performed on the ratios’ ccid50 per milliliter to
rna copies per milliliter of the ribavirin or eicar conditions on one hand and the mpa treatment condition on the
other hand. overall, mpa proved to be more potent in clearing yfv replication than eicar, which in turn was more
potent that ribavirin, an order of potency that is also reflected in the ability of the compounds to inhibit virus replication and to cause gtp depletion (leyssen et al., 2005).
none of the three compounds diminished the infectivity of
progeny virus.
we next studied whether pre-extinction yfv, propagated

all other treatment conditions was lower than that of the
untreated virus control.
for all samples, the most prevalent mutations were a to g,
u to c, c to u, and g to a (table 2). in particular c-to-u and
g-to-a mutations were reported to occur with increased frequency (10- to 13.6-fold increase) in the genome of poliovirus
that was allowed to replicate in the presence of ribavirin
(crotty et al., 2000). therefore, we calculated the frequency
per 1000 nt of c-to-u and g-to-a mutations, and, for comparison, also the frequency per 1000 nt of a-to-g and u-to-c
mutations (table 3). the frequency of c-to-u mutations was
2.4-fold higher for the ribavirin condition than for the virus
control condition (table 3). however, this value was similar
to the value (2.3-fold increase) obtained for virus grown in the
presence of mpa, a molecule that cannot be incorporated into
the viral genome. no marked increase in g-to-a mutation
frequency was noted for the ribavirin (and eicar) condition
compared with either the untreated (virus control) or mpa
condition. likewise, no marked differences were observed
between c-to-u and g-to-a mutation frequencies compared
with a-to-g and u-to-c mutation frequencies for each of the
compounds.

in the presence of concentrations of ribavirin that produced
an obvious antiviral effect that ultimately resulted in total
viral elimination, contained an increased number of mutations. no increase in the overall mutation frequency was
observed between treated and untreated virus. at the
genomic level, one peculiar difference was noted between the
ribavirin/eicar conditions and the mpa condition; in the
latter, no deletion mutants were detected, whereas four deletion mutants were detected in the ribavirin and eicar
conditions (two different deletions each). others also reported the occurrence of deletion mutants in the genomes of
virus treated with ribavirin (crotty et al., 2001; contreras et
al., 2002). the biological significance of these observations
remains elusive.
crotty and colleagues reported that, in particular, c-to-u
(10-fold increase) and g-to-a (13.6-fold increase) mutations
accumulate in the genome of poliovirus cultured in the presence of ribavirin. in our analysis, at most a 2.4-fold increase
in c-to-u mutation frequency was observed in the ribavirintreated virus. however, a similar 2.3-fold increase in c-to-u
mutation frequency was observed in cultures treated with
mpa, a compound that cannot be incorporated into viral
rna. no marked increase in g-to-a mutation frequency was
observed for any of the treatment conditions. an increased
mutation frequency observed in the genome of poliovirus
grown for one passage in the presence of 1000 ␮m (224 ␮g/ml)
ribavirin, which is comparable with the concentration used in
the present study (i.e., 180 ␮g/ml or 738 ␮m), was thus not
observed in the genome of yfv grown in the presence of
ribavirin. yet, the antiviral pressure on yfv may have been
greater than in the poliovirus study, because the virus used
for the mutation analysis had been passaged twice in the
presence of high concentrations of ribavirin. furthermore, in
the present study, 1) complete extinction of viral replication
was achieved, allowing analysis of the mutation frequency in
pre-extinction yfv populations; and 2) mature yfv virus,
which was released in the culture supernatant, was used for
analysis of infectivity and mutation frequency in the genome,
whereas poliovirus rna was extracted from cytoplasmic lysates that may contain immature virus particles as well as
replication complexes.
day et al. (2005) recently reported extinction of west nile
virus replication when this virus was cultured in hela cells
in the presence of 47 ␮g/ml ribavirin (⬇5-fold the ec90 for
ribavirin against wnv in this cell line). however, a concentration as high as 100 ␮g/ml did not inhibit wnv replication
in any of three monkey kidney cell lines tested. in our hands,
a concentration of 100 ␮g/ml ribavirin did elicit a strong
antiviral effect against yfv replication in african green
monkey kidney cells, and, at a concentration of 120 ␮g/ml, it
caused extinction of viral replication within five passages.

(2005) study may in part be explained by differences in cell
culture system but maybe also by particular characteristics
of each virus. likewise, the replication of gb virus b, a virus
closely related to hepatitis c virus, seems to be highly susceptible to error-prone replication induced by ribavirin in
primary tamarin hepatocyte cell cultures (lanford et al.,
2001). maag et al. (2001) reported that the rna-dependent
rna polymerase of hepatitis c virus is able to incorporate
ribavirin in an in vitro polymerization reaction. on average,
10⫺4 to 10⫺5 mutations per nucleotide are accepted per round
of rna replication of rna viruses (domingo et al., 1996;
drake et al., 1998). however, the error rate of the yellow
fever virus rna-dependent rna polymerase was demonstrated to be as low as 1.9 ⫻ 10⫺7 to 2.3 ⫻ 10⫺7 (pugachev et
al., 2004). it remains to be studied whether differences in
error rate between wnv (and other flaviviridae) and yfv
rna-dependent rna polymerases may explain the observations.
there is currently still no consensus whether ribavirin
exerts its antiviral effect in patients with chronic hcv infection by induction of error-prone replication (perelson and
ribeiro, 2005). no increase in mutation rate was detected in
hcv genomes isolated from patients treated with ribavirin
(lutchman et al., 2004; pawlotsky et al., 2004) or ribavirin/
interferon combination therapy (schinkel et al., 2003;
pawlotsky et al., 2005). in contrast, in a subset of ribavirintreated, hcv-infected patients, a mutagenic effect of ribavirin could indeed be observed (asahina et al., 2005). however,
no conclusive evidence has been put forward so far.
in conclusion, our data provide compelling evidence that
error-prone replication, leading to error catastrophe, is not
involved in the in vitro antiviral effect of ribavirin (and other
impdh inhibitors) against yfv replication. they also
reinforce the conclusion reached from our previous study
(leyssen et al., 2005) that the predominant mechanism by
which ribavirin inhibits yfv replication in cell culture is
mediated by inhibition of impdh activity.
