it is becoming increasingly clear that signaling via g proteincoupled receptors is a diverse phenomenon involving receptor
interaction with a variety of signaling partners. despite this diversity, receptor ligands are commonly classified only according to
their ability to modify g protein-dependent signaling. here we
show that ␤2ar ligands like ici118551 and propranolol, which are
inverse agonists for gs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, induce partial
agonist responses for the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1兾2 thus behaving as dual
efficacy ligands. erk1兾2 activation by dual efficacy ligands was not
affected by adp-ribosylation of g␣i and could be observed in
s49-cycⴚ cells lacking g␣s indicating that, unlike the conventional
agonist  xxxd2401xxx , these drugs induce erk1兾2 activation in a
gs兾i-independent manner. in contrast, this activation was inhibited
by a dominant negative mutant of ␤-arrestin and was abolished in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking ␤- xxxg2010xxx  and 2. the role of
␤-arrestin was further confirmed by showing that transfection of
␤-arrestin 2 in these knockout cells restored ici118551 promoted
erk1兾2 activation. ici118551 and propranolol also promoted ␤arrestin recruitment to the receptor. taken together, these observations suggest that ␤-arrestin recruitment is not an exclusive
property of agonists, and that ligands classically classified as
inverse agonists rely exclusively on ␤-arrestin for their positive
signaling activity. this phenomenon is not unique to ␤2-adrenergic
ligands because sr121463b, an  xxxd1422xxx  on the v2 vasopressin receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, recruited ␤-arrestin
and stimulated erk1兾2. these results point to a multistate model
of receptor activation in which ligand-specific conformations are
capable of differentially activating distinct signaling partners.

t

he signaling unit for g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs)
has been classically defined as consisting of the receptor, an
heterotrimeric g protein and enzymatic or channel effectors
controlling second messenger production or ion fluxes that
regulate cell function. more recently it has become clear
that gpcrs may also stimulate a variety of signaling systems that
regulate cell proliferation and differentiation such as mitogenactivated protein kinases (mapks), extracellular signalregulated kinase (erk) 1兾2, c-jun-nh2-terminal kinase (jnk)
3, and p38 (1). in many cases, mitogenic signals generated by
gpcrs involve classical second messenger-dependent pathways
(2), but in others, they require the formation of metastable
complexes that comprise the receptor, accessory proteins such as
␤-arrestins or ask1 and effectors molecules such as src, ras,
erk1兾2, jnk, and mapk kinase 4 (mkk4) (3–6).
despite this growing diversity in gpcr signaling mechanisms,
our definition of drug efficacy is still linked to a scheme
considering only the regulation of the classical g protein signaling. within this framework, agonists are defined as drugs that
stabilize an active receptor conformation that induces g protein
activation, whereas inverse agonists favor an inactive receptor
state that reduces spontaneous g protein signaling (7). the

question that now arises is whether this same paradigm may be
transferred to drug effects generated through the formation of
metastable complexes involving scaffolding proteins such as
␤-arrestin. because all studies describing ␤-arrestin-mediated
mapk signaling have concentrated on agonist drugs, little is
known of how ligands that are commonly classified as inverse
agonists may regulate the scaffold assembly that is crucial for
such signaling.
in the present study, this question was addressed by assessing
whether ␤2-adrenergic receptor (␤2ar) ligands with proven
inverse efficacy on adenylyl cyclase (ac) activity could also
regulate mapk activation via receptor-mediated scaffold formation. we found that, despite being inverse agonists in the ac
pathway, ici118551, and propranolol induced the recruitment of
␤-arrestin leading to the activation of the erk cascade. such
observations indicate that the same drug acting on a unique
receptor can have opposite efficacies depending on the signaling
pathway considered.

wild-type human ␤2ar,  xxxg231xxx , and hemagglutinin (ha)-tagged
(ypydvpdya) ␤2ar sequences were subcloned into a modified pcdna3 vector (invitrogen) in which the cytomegalovirus
promoter was replaced by a rous sarcoma virus promoter as
described (8).
 xxxg231xxx -gfp and ␤2ar-gfp. the coding sequence of the green fluorescent protein variant gfp 10 (9) was inserted in-frame 3⬘ of the
wild-type  xxxg231xxx  sequence into pcdna3- xxxg231xxx  so that a 14-aa
linker (gsgtagpgsppvat), separates the carboxyl tail of the
receptor and the initiator methionine of gfp10. for the ␤2argfp, a gfp10 agei兾bsrgi fragment was subcloned into the
agei兾bsrgi site of pgfp-n1-his␤2ar-yfp (10) to yield pgfpn1–his␤2ar-gfp10.

cell culture and transfections. mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(mefs), hek293 and cos1 cells were grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 units兾ml penicillin, 0.1 mg兾ml streptomycin, and 0.25 ␮g兾ml  xxxd164xxx . s49
mouse lymphoma t cells were grown in dmem as above but
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. freshly
dispersed cardiomyocytes were prepared as described (11).
calcium phosphate precipitation and  xxxg418xxx  selection pressure
(450 ␮g兾ml) were used to produce stable hek293 cell lines
expressing ␤2ar or  xxxg231xxx . mefs were transiently transfected by
using fugene 6 (roche molecular biochemicals) according to
supplier’s specifications. all other transient transfections were
carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation. cells were
cultivated under sterile conditions at 37°c in a 5% co2
atmosphere.
mapk activity, camp accumulation, and gene reporter assays. for
erk1兾2 phosphorylation assays, cells were grown in six-well
plates, serum-starved overnight and then incubated in pbs, at
37°c in the presence of different ligands. cells were lysed in
sample buffer and separated on sds兾10% page, according to
the method of laemmli (12). proteins were transferred onto
nitrocellulose and western blot analysis carried out by using a
1:5,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal antiphospho-erk1兾2
antibody (santa cruz biotechnology). total erk protein was
determined by using a 1:20,000 dilution of anti-erk antibody
(santa cruz biotechnology). blots were then probed with antimouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxydase-conjugated secondary antibodies, visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (amersham pharmacia) and quantified by
densitometric analysis. erk1兾2 phosphorylation was normalized according to the loading of proteins by expressing the data
as a ratio of phospho-erk1兾2 over total erk1兾2. results were
expressed as percentage of the value obtained in nonstimulated
cells.
for camp accumulation assays, cells were incubated for 16 h
with [3h]adenine (2 ␮ci兾ml; 1 ci ⫽ 37 gbq) and washed twice
before stimulation with the indicated drugs at 37°c. after a 15min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of
ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1 mm of unlabeled camp.
[3h]camp was then separated from [3h]atp by sequential
chromatography over dowex and alumina columns. camp
accumulation was calculated as ([3h]camp cpm兾([3h]camp
cpm ⫹ [3h]atp cpm)) ⫻ 1,000 and expressed as a percentage
of nonstimulated cells.
for gene reporter assays, hek293 cells stably expressing the
␤2ar were transiently transfected with pfa- xxxg696xxx  and pfr-luc
reporter plasmids of the pathdetect reporting system (stratagene), by using calcium phosphate precipitation procedure.
after a 6-h incubation with the indicated ligands, luciferase
activity was measured in cell lysates by using a firefly luciferase
assay kit (promega) and a lumicount luminometer (packard),
as described (13).
bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (bret) assay. bret is

a proximity assay based on the nonradiative transfer of energy
between a donor (luciferase) and an acceptor (gfp). it was used
to assess ␤-arrestin recruitment to ␤2ar or  xxxg231xxx  as described
(10). briefly, fusion proteins consisting of the gfp-10 variant
(9), covalently attached to the carboxyl tail of the receptor of
interest (␤2ar-gfp;  xxxg231xxx -gfp), were coexpressed with ␤arrestin 2 fused at its carboxyl terminus to rluc (␤-arrestin-rluc).
after incubation of the transfected cells with different ligands,
deep blue coelanterazine (packard) was added at a final
concentration of 5 ␮m and readings were collected by using a
azzi et al.

modified top-count apparatus (bretcount, packard) that allows the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 370to 450- and 500- to 530-nm windows. the bret signal was
determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the
receptor-gfp (500–530 nm) over the light emitted by the
␤-arrestin-2-rluc (370–450 nm). the values were corrected by
subtracting the background signal detected when the ␤-arrestin2-rluc construct was expressed alone.
immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out in cos1 cells transiently
transfected either with a ha-tagged ␤2v2r chimera (consisting
of the first 341 aa of the ␤2ar and the last 29 aa of the v2) and
␤-arrestin-2–gfp or ha-tagged ␤2ar and  xxxg1366xxx  gfp by using
fugene 6. immunolabeling of the ha-tagged ␤2v2r and
␤2ar was carried out in nonpermeabilized cells by using the
anti-ha (12ca5; 1:100) antibody. immunoreactivity was revealed by using a texas red-conjugated secondary antibody.
␤-arrestin-gfp and  xxxg1366xxx -gfp were visualized by direct fluorescence detection. quantitative assessment of nuclear translocation of  xxxg1366xxx -gfp was carried out by counting the number of
cells in which gfp fluorescence colocalized with the nuclear
marker to-pro-3 iodine (molecular probes). all confocal microscopy images were acquired on a leica hm irbe laserscanning microscope with a ⫻100 objective.

results and discussion
hek293 fibroblasts stably expressing the ␤2ar were used to
compare the effects of different ␤2ar ligands on the classical
g␣s-mediated activation of the ac pathway and the mapk
cascade. as previously reported (14, 15),  xxxd2401xxx  behaved
as an agonist in the two systems, leading to increased camp
production and erk1兾2 phosphorylation (fig. 1 a and b). also
in agreement with previous reports (14), propranolol and
ici118551 produced  xxxd1422xxx  effects for the ac pathway,

inhibiting camp production by 35% and 50%, respectively (fig.
1 a). however, these two compounds were found to be agonists
at the mapk cascade, with propranolol inducing a 67% increase
and ici118551 inducing a 52% increase in erk1兾2 phosphorylation (fig. 1b).  xxxd3377xxx , was devoid of intrinsic activity in the
two pathways (fig. 1 a and c) but competitively blocked both
 xxxd1422xxx  (ref. 14 and data not shown) and agonist (fig. 1c)
effects of ici118551.
opposing effects of ici118551 and propranolol on ac and
mapk activity cannot be attributed to an artifact related to
receptor overexpression in hek293 cells because their dual
actions were also observed in cos1 (fig. 1b inset), s49 cells (see
below), and cardiomyocytes (fig. 1d) all of them endogenously
expressing low levels of ␤2ar. the activation kinetics of mapk
by  xxxd2401xxx , ici118551, and propranolol were similar;
activation was fast and transient, and reached a peak between 1
and 2 min after drug addition (fig. 1d). however, the effects of
ici118551 and propranolol appear to be slightly slower because
their maximal activity was observed at 2 min rather than at 1 min,
as for  xxxd2401xxx .
consistent with the known longer-term nuclear translocation
of activated erk, both  xxxd2401xxx  and ici118551 promoted
targeting of  xxxg1366xxx -gfp to the nucleus after a 20-min treatment
with the drugs (fig. 2a). as is the case for  xxxd2401xxx , erk
nuclear translocation promoted by dual efficacy drugs ici118551
and propranolol also has functional consequences as illustrated
by increased elk-dependent transcriptional activity (fig. 2b).

and inverse agonists in the treatment of hypertension and heart
failure (16), the agonistic properties of these compounds on the
erk pathway could have clinically relevant implications.
because both g␣s (2, 15, 17) and g␣i (15, 18) have been
shown to contribute to mapk activation by the conventional
agonist  xxxd2401xxx , we sought to determine whether this was
also the case for drugs with dual efficacy like propranolol or
ici118551. the possible role of g␣s was assessed by comparing
the effects of ici118551 and  xxxd2401xxx  in s49 wild-type and
s49 cyc⫺ cells that lack g␣s (19). as shown in fig. 3a, both
 xxxd2401xxx  and ici118551 promoted erk phosphorylation in
wild-type s49 cells, but only ici118551 activated the kinase in
the cyc⫺ cells, indicating that g␣s is not needed for mapk
activation by dual efficacy drugs. to test the potential implication of g␣i兾o, hek293 cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin
(ptx). the treatment abolished mapk activation by a typical
g␣i兾o coupled ␦-opioid receptor but was without effect on erk
phosphorylation induced by ici118551 (fig. 3b), ruling out a
role for g␣i兾o in this response. in keeping with previous
observations (15, 18) where mapk activation by  xxxd2401xxx 
has been shown to require the sequential activation of g␣s and
g␣i兾o, the agonist response was not only absent in the s49 cyc⫺
cells, but was also significantly inhibited by ptx treatment.
taken together, these results indicate that unlike  xxxd2401xxx , ici118551 activates the mapk signaling pathway independently of g␣i and g␣s. the lack of g protein involvement is
azzi et al.

further supported by the observation that overexpression of the
carboxyl tail of  xxxg970xxx , which acts as a scavenger of g␤␥ (20), did
not modify ici118551-stimulated erk1兾2 phosphorylation
(data not shown). g protein-independent activation of mapk
has been recently documented for mutants of the  xxxg99xxx 
type 1 receptors that fail to couple to their cognate g proteins
(21). this finding may indicate that g protein-independent
mapk signaling is a general feature of heptahelical receptors,
unveiled when g protein coupling is prevented either as a result
of mutations or after the stabilization of the receptor by ligands
such as ici118551 or propranolol that inhibit receptor–g protein interaction.
the nonreceptor  xxxg2198xxx  src is an intermediate in
diverse pathways leading to mapk activation by gpcrs (1, 3,
22) whether they involve g protein signaling (15) or not (21). as
shown in fig. 4a, g protein-independent activation of erk by
ici118551 was also found to involve src activation because it was
blocked by the selective src inhibitor  xxxd1307xxx . several mechanisms
of src activation by gpcrs have been proposed (1). for the
␤2ar,  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation has been shown to promote the
recruitment of src through an indirect interaction that involves
the proline-rich motif of ␤-arrestin and the src homology 3
domain of src (3). in addition to its adaptor role, bridging the
receptor and src, ␤-arrestin has been shown to function as a

scaffold protein organizing the assembly of raf, map兾erk
kinase, erk兾ask1, mkk4, and  xxxg1367xxx  modules for an increasing number of gpcrs (4–6, 23). we therefore examined the role
of ␤-arrestin in promoting erk1兾2 activity by ici118551. to do
so, we first used a dominant negative mutant corresponding to
the carboxyl-terminal fragment (␤arr319–418) of ␤-arrestin,
previously shown to decrease erk1兾2 activation by  xxxd2401xxx  (24). similar to the  xxxd2401xxx  response, ici118551
activation of erk1兾2 was inhibited by ␤arr319–418 (fig. 4b),
suggesting that ␤-arrestin also mediates the mapk stimulation
by dual efficacy drugs. the role of ␤-arrestin in erk1兾2activation by ici118551 was further documented by using mefs
derived from knockout (ko) animals lacking ␤- xxxg2010xxx  and 2
(␤arr-dko) (25). in contrast with the significant erk phosphorylation induced by  xxxd2401xxx  and ici118551 in wildtype mefs, neither drug activated the mapk pathway in the
␤arr-dko cells (fig. 4c). however, the erk1兾2 response to
ici118551 was restored on transient transfection of ␤-arrestin 2
into double ko (dko) cells (fig. 4c) confirming its role as an
adaptor兾scaffolding protein in this pathway.
␤-arrestins have been extensively characterized as regulators
of agonist-induced gpcr signaling (26), and their role in
agonist-promoted desensitization and receptor internalization
are well defined. classically, ␤-arrestins are recruited to the
membrane by the agonist-occupied state of the receptor. once
this association takes place, the receptor is uncoupled from the
g protein (27) and targeted to the endocytic compartment (28)
via direct interactions with proteins of clathrin-coated pits
(29–31). the observation that ici118551 relies on ␤-arrestin to
induce mapk activation suggests that, in addition to classical
agonists, some drugs normally classified as ‘‘inverse agonists’’
can also promote the recruitment of ␤-arrestin.
this hypothesis was tested by assessing ligand-promoted ␤arrestin recruitment using immunofluorescence microscopy. in
cos1 cells coexpressing ha-tagged ␤2ar and ␤-arrestin-gfp,
a modest translocation of ␤-arrestin to the membrane could be
observed on stimulation with  xxxd2401xxx  but not ici118551 or
propranolol (data not shown). we reasoned that this negative
result could be caused by a combination of factors. first, the
␤2ar belongs to a class of gpcrs known to have relatively low
affinity for ␤-arrestin, leading to only transient complexes between the two proteins (31). second, when compared with
 xxxd2401xxx , ici118551 and propranolol display partial agonistic activities toward mapk signaling and their reduced
efficacy could have caused incomplete ␤-arrestin recruitment
that went undetected. to overcome these limitations, we took
advantage of the fact that  xxxg231xxx  interacts more tightly than ␤2ar
with ␤-arrestin (31). because this property has been mapped to
the last 10 aa of the  xxxg231xxx  tail, we used a receptor chimera
consisting of the first 341 aa of the ␤2ar fused to the last 29 aa
of the  xxxg231xxx . this chimera has previously been shown to have high
affinity for ␤-arrestin (31). as shown in fig. 5a,  xxxd2401xxx 
and ici118551 promoted a robust translocation of ␤-arrestingfp to the membrane of cos1 cells expressing the chimeric
␤2v2r. in contrast, vasopressin, which does not bind the chimera, was without effect on ␤-arrestin cell distribution (data not
shown).
the results presented above are consistent with the notion that
binding of compounds such as ici118551 and propranolol can
stabilize a receptor conformation that allows ␤-arrestin binding
to a chimeric ␤2v2r receptor, but did not prove that this can
occur for the wild-type ␤2ar. to directly assess the physical
interaction between the ligand-bound ␤2ar itself and ␤-arrestin,
we turned to a more sensitive assay based on bret. for this,
␤2ar-gfp and ␤-arrestin-rluc were transiently coexpressed in
hek293 cells. as shown in fig. 5b,  xxxd2401xxx , propranolol,
and ici118551 all induced ␤-arrestin recruitment, as indicated
by an increase in the bret signal. consistent with the partial

agonist effect of ici118551 and propranolol on the mapk
activity, bret increases promoted by these compounds were
significantly smaller than the one induced by  xxxd2401xxx . this
low efficacy of propranolol in promoting ␤-arrestin recruitment
is consistent with previous immunofluorescence results showing
that propranolol can inhibit  xxxd2401xxx -induced ␤-arrestin
mobilization (29). such an inhibition is also seen in the bret
experiments where propranolol reduced the signal induced by
 xxxd2401xxx  to the level attained on stimulation with propranolol alone (fig. 5b).
taken together, our observations suggest that, although they
are inverse agonists on the g␣s-stimulated ac cascade, compounds such as ici118551 and propranolol have partial agonist
efficacy on the ␤-arrestin-dependent mapk pathway. these
findings are not consistent with a classical view proposing a
unique ‘‘activated’’ receptor conformation involved in g protein
coupling and ␤-arrestin recruitment. they are more in keeping
with the emerging concept that distinct active conformations
may be stabilized by different ligands (32) and that some of these
conformations may favor activation of one effector over another
(33) or induce differential recruitment of ␤-arrestin (34, 35). for
the systems considered herein, classical agonists like  xxxd2401xxx  would stabilize a receptor state capable of activating g␣s
and of promoting the recruitment of ␤-arrestin, whereas the
conformation stabilized by ici118551 or propranolol would
interdict productive g protein coupling but favor ␤-arrestin

engagement. previous reports showing that some gpcr antagonists can promote receptor endocytosis (36, 37), a phenomenon
normally triggered by agonists, could also find their explanation
in the concept of discrete receptor conformations that have only
some of the properties of the fully active state. the idea that
␤-arrestin may interact with several distinct receptor conformations is also consistent with the observations that not only
agonists (38) but also certain gpcr antagonists (39) display
high affinity for the ␤-arrestin-bound form of the receptor.
in addition to demonstrating that ligands may have dual
efficacies depending on the effector system considered, our
study clearly shows that a single receptor can activate the mapk
through distinct mechanisms. indeed, although both gs and
␤-arrestin were found to be involved in the isoproterenolmediated activation, only ␤-arrestin contributes to the activation
by ici118551 and propranolol. whether this difference in the
mapk activation mechanism between the two classes of ligands
could underlie the modest difference in the activation kinetics
observed in fig. 1d remains to be determined.
to assess whether dual efficacy was unique to ␤2ar ligands
or whether it could be a general concept applicable to other
seven transmembrane domain receptors, ac and mapk regulation by  xxxg231xxx  drugs was also examined. as shown in fig. 6 a and
b, sr121463b, a non-peptide  xxxg231xxx  selective ligand, induced an
 xxxd1422xxx  response on the ac pathway but clearly stimulated mapk activity in hek293 cells stably expressing the
human  xxxg231xxx , an observation that extends the concept of dual
efficacy ligands to another gpcr. similarly to what was observed for ici118551 and propranolol at the ␤2ar, sr121463b
promoted the recruitment of ␤-arrestin to the  xxxg231xxx . indeed, a
time-dependent recruitment could be detected by bret in
hek293 cells transiently coexpressing  xxxg231xxx -gfp and ␤-arrestinrluc (fig. 6c). in agreement with the partial agonist activity of
azzi et al.

sr121463b on the mapk activity, its ␤-arrestin recruitment was
also partial, with a bret signal that reached 38% of the
vasopressin-induced response. as expected, ici118551 was without effect on the recruitment of ␤-arrestin to the  xxxg231xxx , confirming the selectivity of the response.
overall, the results of the present study point to a general
multistate model of receptor activation in which ligand-specific
conformations are capable of differential activation of distinct
signaling partners. this is reminiscent of the concept of ‘‘trafficking of receptor stimulus’’ (33, 40) previously proposed to
explain that ligands can activate diverse effectors with distinct
rank order of potencies and兾or efficacies. however, results
presented herein add a new level of complexity, showing that a
ligand can have opposing efficacies on two effector systems
engaged by the same receptor, indicating that the ‘‘direction’’ of
response can be influenced by the effector considered. the study
also confirms ␤-arrestin in its role as a genuine signaling partner
