summary the metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation of
factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus.
indeed, hypertension occurs approximately twice as frequently in patients with diabetes compared with in nondiabetic controls. conversely, hypertensive patients are more likely than normotensive persons to develop diabetes. in
addition, up to 75% of cvd in diabetic patients can be attributed to hypertension. therefore, the primary goals of
treating hypertensive patients with insulin resistance are prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.
then, what is the optimal anti-hypertensive approach to target organ protection in these patients? several clinical
trials suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (ras) plays a pivotal role in the pathogensis of insulin resistance and
cvd in diabetes. interruption of the ras with angiotensin-coverting enzyme inhibitors (aceis) or  xxxg99xxx  type 1
receptor blockers (arbs) has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients and to reduce
cardiovascular and renal disease progression in diabetic patients with hypertension. however, whether we should
recommend arbs for insulin resistant-hypertensive patients or type 2 diabetic patients without nephropathy due to its
insulin-sensitizing property remains to be clarified. recently,  xxxd3303xxx , an arb, was found to act as a patrtial
agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c (ppar-c). ppar-c influences the gene expression involved in
carbohydrate metabolism, and pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, ligands for ppar-c, improve insulin resistance in
diabetic patients. furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that activators of ppar-c exert anti-inflammatory,
anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative effects on vascular wall cells, thus decreasing the risks for atherosclerosis. we
hypothesize here that due to its unique ppar-c-modulating activity,  xxxd3303xxx  will become a promising
â€˜cardiometabolic sartanâ€™, that targets both diabetes and cvd in hypertensive patients. in this paper, we would like
to propose the possible ways of testing our hypothesis. does  xxxd3303xxx  reduce the development of diabetes and cvd
in insulin resistant patients pretreated with maximal doses of other arbs? does co-treatment with an activator of
ppar-c attenuate the effects of  xxxd3303xxx  in these patients? these clinical studies will provide further information
whether the beneficial cardiometabolic actions of  xxxd3303xxx  could be ascribed to its ppar-c-inducing property.

diabetes mellitus [1]. hypertension occurs approximately twice as frequently in patients with diabetes compared with in non-diabetic controls [2â€“5].
conversely, recent data suggest that hypertensive
patinets are more likely to develop diabetes than
normotensive persons [2â€“5]. the association of
diabetes with hypertension increases its risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. indeed, up to
75% of cardiovascular disease (cvd) in diabetic patients can be attributed to hypertension [2â€“5].
therefore, the primary goals of treating the metabolic syndrome are prevention of type 2 diabetes
and cardiovascular events.
why are hypertensive patients so prone to insulin resistance? in other words, what is the optimal
anti-hypertensive approach to target organ protection in these insulin resistant patients? as to these
questions, there is widespread agreement that the
renin-the angiotensin system (ras) plays a pivotal
role in the pathogensis of insulin resistance and
cvd in diabetes and large clinical trials have demonstrated substantial benefit of the blockade of
this system for end-organ protection [6â€“8]. indeed, interruption of the ras with angiotensincoverting enzyme inhibitors (aceis) or angiotensin
ii type 1 receptor blockers (arbs) has been recently
shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients and to reduce cardiovascular and
renal disease progression in diabetic patients with
hypertension [6â€“8]. on the basis of these findings,
the american diabetes association (ada) currently
recommends arbs as first-line therapy for hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with micro- or
macro-albuminuria. a possible mechanism for the
putative diabetogenic effect of the ras might be
its downstream action on the  xxxg1194xxx  signaling [9]. however, at present, whether we should
recommend arbs for insulin resistant-hypertensive
patients or type 2 diabetic patients without nephropathy due to its insulin-sensitizing property remains to be clarified.
recently,  xxxd3303xxx , an arb, was found to act
as a patrtial agonist of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-c (ppar-c), thus reducing
glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in rats fed
a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet [10,11]. ppar-c
influences the gene expression involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and pioglitazone and
rosiglitazone, ligands for ppar-c, improve insulin
resistance in diabetic patients [12,13]. furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that
activators of ppar-c exert anti-inflammatory,
anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative effects on vascular wall cells, thus decreasing the risks for atherosclerosis [12,13]. we hypothesize here that due to
its unique ppar-c-modulating activity,  xxxd3303xxx 

will become a promising â€˜cardiometabolic sartanâ€™,
that targets both diabetes and cvd in hypertensive
patients. in this paper, we also would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypothesis
as follows. (1) does  xxxd3303xxx  improve insulin
resistance or endothelial dysfunction in fructosefed  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor ( xxxg100xxx )-deficient
mice? if the answer is yes,  xxxd3303xxx  could exert
beneficial cardiometabolic actions independent of
their  xxxg100xxx  blocking actions. at that time, if the
cardiometabolic actions of  xxxd3303xxx  are blocked
by simultaneous treatment with an inhibitor of
ppar-c, the unique properties of this drug could
be attributed to its ppar-c-modulating activity.
(2) does  xxxd3303xxx  reduce the development of
diabetes and cvd in insulin resistant patients? are
the beneficial cardiometabolic actions also observed in insulin resistant patients pretreated with
maximal doses of other arbs? does co-treatment
with an activator of ppar-c attenuate the effects
of  xxxd3303xxx  in these patients? if all of the answers are yes, the clinical effectiveness of  xxxd3303xxx  could be ascribed to its ppar-c-inducing
property. ongoing clinical trial (ontarget) has
been designed the efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  with an
acei, ramipril, alone or in combination [14]. this
randomized, double-blind, multicenter international studies will provide further information
whether  xxxd3303xxx  can improve insulin resistance
and subsequently reduce the development of diabetes and cvd in high-risk hypertensive patients.
