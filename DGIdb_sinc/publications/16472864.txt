abstract
multiple sclerosis (ms) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (cns) characterized by demyelination, with a relative sparing
of axons. in ms patients, many neurologic signs and symptoms have been attributed to the underlying conduction deficits. the idea that
neurologic function might be improved if conduction could be restored in cns demyelinated axons led to the testing of potassium (k+) channel
blockers as a symptomatic treatment. to date, only 2 broad-spectrum k+ channel blockers,  xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx ) and 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4dap), have been tested in ms patients. although both  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap produce clear neurologic benefits, their use has been limited by toxicity.
here we review the current status of basic science and clinical research related to the therapeutic targeting of voltage-gated k+ channels (kv) in
ms. by bringing together 3 distinct but interrelated disciplines, we aim to provide perspective on a vast body of work highlighting the lengthy and
ongoing process entailed in translating fundamental kv channel knowledge into new clinical treatments for patients with ms and other
demyelinating diseases. covered are (1) kv channel nomenclature, structure, function, and pharmacology; (2) classic and current experimental
morphology and neurophysiology studies of demyelination and conduction deficits; and (3) a comprehensive overview of clinical trials utilizing 4ap and 3,4-dap in ms patients.

1. introduction
multiple sclerosis (ms) is an inflammatory demyelinating
disease of the central nervous system (cns) (martin et al.,
1992) characterized by axonal conduction block (prineas &
wright, 1978). two non-specific potassium (k+) channel
blocking drugs,  xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx ) and 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-dap), have been tested as a symptomatic treatment
in patients with ms (for a reviews, see bever, 1994; solari et
al., 2003) based on the clinical rationale that neurologic
function could be improved by overcoming conduction block
in demyelinated axons present in ms lesions. although  xxxd1804xxx ,
in particular, produces clear neurologic benefits in some
patients, seizure induction has hampered the widespread use
of either of these k+ channel blockers. both  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap
are potent convulsants with narrow toxic-to-therapeutic ratios
that probably arise from their poor selectivity for and
indiscriminate blockade of various subtypes of voltage-gated
k+ channels (kv) present in neurons.
the neurological benefits achieved clinically with  xxxd1804xxx  and
3,4-dap (jones et al., 1983; stefoski et al., 1987; davis et al.,
1990; bever et al., 1990; vandiemen et al., 1992; bever et al.,
1994) have been widely viewed as resulting from improved

conduction due to block of kv channels exposed along
demyelinated axons and/or at presynaptic membranes. originally, 2 experimental lines of evidence led to  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap
being tested in patients with ms. first,  xxxd1804xxx  restored
conduction in experimentally demyelinated nerves in the
peripheral nervous system (pns) (sherratt et al., 1980; bostock
et al., 1981; targ & kocsis, 1985; rasband et al., 1998).
second,  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap increased presynaptic action
potential duration and amplitude leading to enhanced transmitter release (lemeignan et al., 1969; molgo et al., 1980; thesleff,
1980; perreault & avoli, 1991). however, contrary to the longstanding views based on earlier experimental pns studies, a
more recent and the first experimental cns study indicated that
at clinical doses of  xxxd1804xxx  (based on measured maximal serum
levels in ms trials) (bever et al., 1994) the beneficial neurologic
effects were likely independent of demyelination (smith et al.,
2000). specifically, smith et al. (2000) demonstrated that
clinical doses of  xxxd1804xxx  failed to reliably restore conduction in
experimentally demyelinated rat dorsal column axons but did
potentiate synaptic transmission and skeletal muscle twitch
tension. clinical support for this conclusion comes from a
recent clinical studies in ms patients (fujihara & miyoshi,
1998; mainero et al., 2004) in which single therapeutic doses of

3,4-dap produced enhanced cns motor-evoked brain activation but not improved motor conduction time or muscular
fatigability.
another possibility for some of the clinical benefits
observed following  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap treatment in ms is
that neurologic improvements may reflect, in part, immunomodulatory effects due to blockade of  xxxd1804xxx - and 3,4-dapsensitive kv channels in microglia, macrophages, dendritic
cells (dc), and/or t-lymphocytes (for discussions, see sections
4.1. and 4.3; for overviews, see perry & phil, 2005; judge et
al., in press). because  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap are broad-spectrum
kv channel blockers, both their beneficial and toxic clinical
effects may result from blockade of a wide variety of
differentially localized kv channels. although likely candidates
are recognized, the precise channels underlying either the
beneficial or toxic effects of  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap remain
undetermined.
2. molecular structure and function of kv channels
beginning with the cloning of the drosophila shaker locus
gene in 1987 (kamb et al., 1987; papazian et al., 1987), studies
combining molecular, electrophysiological, and pharmacological techniques revealed a vast diversity of different types of k+
channels that proved to be as remarkable as it was unexpected.
distinct k+ channel genes encode the molecular structure of
each different type of k+ channel subunit; k+ channels are
formed from 4 a- or pore-forming subunits and exist as either
homotetramers or heterotetramers. in many instances, h-subunits
or accessory subunits interact with the intracellular surfaces of
kv a-subunits modifying their function. the phylogenetic tree
of all k+ channel genes, as identified by protein sequence
comparisons, divides first into 4 structural classes based on
whether the a-subunits comprising a given k+ the a-subunits
comprising a given k+ channel contain 2 [2tm; i.e., inward
rectifiers and atp-regulated k+ channels (kir)], 4 [4tm; i.e.,
background, leak, or tandem 2-pore k+ channels (k2p)], 6 [6tm;
i.e., delayed rectifiers (dr), rapidly inactivating (a-type), and
small/intermediate conductance voltage and calcium-activated
k+ channels (kca)], or 7 [7tm; i.e., large conductance calciumactivated k+ channels (kca)] transmembrane domains (table 1).
the family of kv channels belongs to the 6tm structural
class. originally, the 6tm structural class was comprised of 6
k+ channel families including kv, kqt-type, cyclic nucleotidegated calcium-activated (cng), ether-a-go-go-related (eag,
erg, or elk), small/intermediate conductance calcium-activated
(sk/ik), and large conductance calcium-activated (slo, maxi
kca, or bk) k+ channels (for reviews, see rudy, 1988, 1999;
soria & ceña, 1998; coetzee et al., 1999; kurachi et al., 1999;
ashcroft, 2000; hille, 2001). the formerly separate families of
kqt and cng k+ channels have been reclassified as members
of the kv family, whereas the family of large conductance
calcium-activated k+ channels is now recognized as a separate
structural class (7tm); channel subunits contain a 7th
transmembrane segment due to the extracellular location of
the n-terminus as opposed to its intracellular location in 6tm
k+ channels (see table 1) (gutman et al., 2002, 2003).

2.1. kv channel subfamilies and nomenclature
many kv channels have been cloned and sequenced from
different tissues in different species (for reviews, see pongs et
al., 1988; pongs, 1992; north, 1995; kurachi et al., 1999;
iuphar compendium of voltage-gated ion channels, 2002;
http://www.iuphar-db.org/iuphar-ic/). four subfamilies of distinct kv genes were originally identified in drosophila. the
initial cloning of members of the shaker (sh) subfamily of kv
channels (kamb et al., 1987, 1988; papazian et al., 1987; pongs
et al., 1988; schwarz et al., 1988; tempel et al., 1988; christie
et al., 1989; frech et al., 1989) was quickly followed by
isolation of the shab (sb), shaw (sw), and shal (sl) subfamily
genes (butler et al., 1989, 1990; wei et al., 1990; covarrubias
et al., 1991). homologous subfamilies of vertebrate genes were
subsequently found in xenopus, mouse, rat, and man (salkoff
et al., 1992) and became commonly referred to using the (sh)
‘‘kv1’’, (sb) ‘‘kv2’’, (sw) ‘‘kv3’’, and (sl) ‘‘kv4’’ original
standardized nomenclature (chandy, 1991; chandy & gutman,
1995; jan, 1999) for kv channels in which 6 subfamilies
(‘‘kv1’’ –‘‘kv6’’) were described. proposed as a means to
simplify and order the burgeoning list of human kv gene names
and their species homologues this first standardized nomenclature (table 1; left 2 columns) was widely accepted and
useful. by eliminating tissue of origin identifiers that often
characterized early channel naming, it focused channel
nomenclature on the ‘‘sequence relatedness’’ of the channel
genes (channels sharing 65% sequence identity being classified
as a single subfamily) and was quickly expanded to include
standardized nomenclatures for calcium-activated (kca) and
inwardly rectifying (kir) k+ channels (table 1; left 2 columns).
prior to the successful sequencing of the human genome,
which initially identified 67 human k+ channel proteins (the
international human genome mapping consortium, 2001;
venter et al., 2001), the human genome organization (hugo)
developed and introduced new guidelines for naming human
genes in 1997 (white et al., 1997). the resulting kcn system
established a new standardized nomenclature for k+ channels
(table 1; middle 2 columns). although the original standardized nomenclature needed updating, the hugo kcn nomenclature only introduced renewed confusion by removing all
intuitive identifiers and failing to logically classify channel
genes based on the molecular relationships between ion
channel proteins. as a result, the use of the hugo kcn
nomenclature has been more often parenthetic than not.
subsequently, the international union of pharmacology
(iuphar) together with the american society for pharmacology and experimental therapeutics (aspet) convened
multiple subcommittees to resolve these prevailing confusions
and introduced a comprehensive and rational nomenclature
(gutman et al., 2003; iuphar compendium of voltage-gated
ion channels, 2002; http://www.iuphar-db.org/iuphar-ic/; catterall et al., 2003) that reinserted fundamental intuitive
identifiers, classification based on molecular relatedness, and
is meeting with wide acceptance within the ion channel field
(table 1; right 2 columns). to date, 12 subfamilies of kv
channel genes have been identified (gutman et al., 2003).

2.2. kv channel molecular structure

a
extracellular

kv channels are a heterogeneous family of integral membrane
proteins that share the common structural motif consisting of 6
membrane spanning alpha-helical regions (s1 –s6) and a highly
conserved loop (p segment previouslycalled ‘‘ss1’’, ‘‘ss2’’, and
‘‘h5’’) between the fifth and sixth alpha-helical regions that
forms the ion selective part (selectivity filter) of the pore. the
fourth helical region is thought to be the actual voltage sensor
because it has a positively charged amino acid at every third
residue so that it is polarized (catterall, 1988) (see fig. 1).

2.3. molecular determinants of kv channel function
changes in the transmembrane electric field induce structural
rearrangements in kv channels that open the ion translocation
pore. channels can either be conducting (open) or non-conducting (closed or inactivated) (fig. 2a – d). in response to
appropriate changes in the transmembrane electric field, the
non-conducting channel undergoes structural rearrangements,
which open (activation) or close (deactivation) the ion translocation pore (mccormack et al., 1994). in rapidly inactivating
channels (fig. 2c), the ion translocation pore is occluded by the
binding of a hydrophobic n-terminal fball_ to the cytoplasmic
vestibule of the pore (this is called rapid or n-type inactivation)
(isacoff et al., 1993). the latency is dependent on the length of the
n-terminal fchain_ and is typically in milliseconds (hoshi et al.,
1990; zagotta et al., 1990). after a period of binding, the
inactivation ‘‘ball’’ releases in a process called frecovery from
inactivation_. multiple inactivation domains have been identified
in the amino terminal fball and chain_ region of the  xxxg1233xxx  asubunit (ruppersberg et al., 1991; kondoh et al., 1997). in
addition, solution structures have been determined for of the nterminal inactivation domain as well as the kvh subunits that
confer rapid inactivation on non-inactivating or slowing inactivating k+ channels (schott et al., 1998; gulbis et al., 2000;
bentrop et al., 2001; wissmann et al., 2003). a second form of
inactivation, termed fc-type inactivation_ (fig. 2d), emerges with
prolonged depolarization leading to decreased current flow due to
structural changes that constrict the extracellular end of the ion
translocation pore (grissmer & cahalan, 1989; choi et al., 1991;
yellen et al., 1994; liu et al., 1996; kiss & korn, 1998).
detailed kinetic models of the kv channel activation gating
mechanism have been published (bezanilla et al., 1991; zagotta et
al., 1990, 1994a, 1994b, 1994c). these models mathematically
describe the steady state open state probability and the kinetic
transitions taking place during activation conformational changes
in kv channels. such models are based on the ability to measure
gating currents that reflect, not the movement of charged ions
(ionic currents) through the pore, but the intramolecular
movement of charges or dipoles (gating currents) within the
subunits of the channel protein itself (voltage-dependent action of
the channel voltage sensor thought to be the s4 transmembrane
segment in kv) (armstrong, 1971; armstrong & bezanilla, 1974;
bezanilla, 1985; bezanilla et al., 1991).
functionally, kv channel structure can be divided into 2
distinct regions. each subunit contains a voltage-sensing region

encompassing the s1 through s4 transmembrane segments and a

interact or more specifically how the voltage-sensing region
translates transmembrane voltage changes into structural conformational changes that open or close the ion translocation pore
remains unresolved and controversial but entered an exciting era
in 2003 with the first crystallization of a kv channel. using x-ray
crystallography techniques, the mackinnon laboratory crystallized the bacterial kv channel from aeropyrum pernix (kvap;
jiang et al., 2003a, 2003b). their results reinvigorated research in
this area by yielding an unexpected visualization of the voltage-

sensing region that conflicted with prevailing views on the
structure and movement of the voltage-sensing s4 segment in a
kv channel. it was the tertiary structure (not the primary or
secondary structures) in kvap that came as a surprise. unlike the
long-standing and experimentally supported view that each of the
s1–s4 segments spanned the transmembrane region, the cterminus half of s3 and the s4 segment in kvap appeared to form
a ‘‘paddle-like’’ structure lying alongside the intracellular surface
of the membrane ‘‘translocating’’ charge through the membrane
while s1 and s2 were approximately parallel to the surface of the
membrane encircling the pore-forming s5–p–s6 domain. in
contrast, the voltage-sensing s1–s4 region of the recently

s.i.v. judge, c.t. bever jr. / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 224 – 259

determined  xxxg1231xxx  crystal structure has the anticipated transmembrane topology with a tertiary structure very similar to that of the
second kvap crystal structure of an isolated voltage-sensing
domain. the mackinnon lab (jiang et al., 2003b) recognized that
the voltage-sensing domain of the full-length kvap crystal
structure is distorted from its native conformation, as a probable
result of the antibodies used in the purification and crystallization
process and/or the fact that the detergent solubilized protein does
not exist in its native bilayer. the s4 helix in the  xxxg1231xxx  crystal
structure packs next to the s5 helix, consistent with results of
numerous experimental studies of the sh channel. the first 4
positively charged residues of s4 are near the extracellular surface
of the membrane, and the s6 gate does not occlude the pore,
indicating that this structure probably has an open conformation.
the  xxxg1231xxx  crystal structure also confirms early proposals that the
s4–s5 linker forms an amphipathic a helix that lies parallel to the
cytoplasmic surface of the membrane (guy, 1990). this linker
and adjacent portions of s4 and s5 possess a leucine heptad
repeat (mccormack et al., 1991), comprised of 5 leucines
occurring at every seventh amino acid residue position, which
is a highly conserved k+ channel motif first recognized by
mccormack et al. (1989). however, phenylalanine replaces the
fourth heptad leucine (l4) in kv3 channels and the first heptad
leucine (l1) in kv4 channels. in other proteins (not k+ channels),
this leucine heptad repeat is known as the fleucine zipper_ where
it plays a role in the formation of subunit parallel coiled coils.
mutations of the leucine heptad repeat residues often affect,
dramatically, the gating of channel activation in kv channels (see
section 3.2.2. for a discussion of s4–s5 linker mutation effects
on the potency of  xxxd1804xxx  blockade). the  xxxg1231xxx  crystal structure
indicates that the s4–s5 linker interacts with the s6 gate
suggesting strongly that it couples movement of the s4 voltage
sensor to opening of the s6 gate.
numerous models have been proposed for the voltagesensing mechanism of activation gating. the best known of
these are the fhelical screw_ (guy & seetharamulu, 1986;
shrivastava et al., 2004; durell et al., 2004), the fgating pore_
(yang et al., 1996), the ftransporter_ (starace & bezanilla, 2004),
and the fpaddle_ (jiang et al., 2003a, 2003b). the fgating pore_
model stipulates that, during gating, s4 moves through protein
and a partially water-filled pore. the feature of this model that
excludes exposure of s4 to lipids is inconsistent with the  xxxg1231xxx 
crystal structure and results of electron paramagnetic resonance
(epr) studies of the kvap channel that identify substantial
exposure of s4 to lipids. the fhelical screw_ model proposes that
s4 translates along and rotates about its axis so that its positively
charged residues remain in the same spiral pathway relative the
s1 –s3 segments throughout the transitions. its authors acknowledge that there is no energetic or theoretical problem with
its hydrophobic residues being exposed to the lipid alky chains
or with its positively charged residues being exposed to lipids
near the membrane surfaces (shrivastava et al., 2004). however,
they do argue that when positively charged groups of s4 pass
through the central portion of the bilayer, it is energetically
favorable for them to form salt bridges with negatively charged
residues of the s1 – s3 segments. atomically explicit fhelical
screw_ models have been developed using the crystal structure of

233

the isolated kvap domain to model the open channel
conformation. the fpaddle_ model differs from the fhelical
screw_ model in that the s3 –s4 hairpin remains intact during
gating and it does not require interactions between the positively
charged residues of s4 and the negatively charged residues of
s1 – s3 (however, it does not exclude such interactions).
primarily, it is based on the observation that in different kvap
crystal structures the s3b– s4 helical hairpin (or fpaddle_)
remains intact, and on studies in which a biotin adduct attached
near the middle of s4 can bind to extracellular avidin at positive
voltages and to intracellular avidin at negative voltages. this has
been interpreted to indicate that s4 moves at least 15 å across the
membrane during gating. the ftransporter_ model differs from
the others in that the voltage dependency is postulated to be due
to alterations of the accessibilities of the positively charged s4
residue to water-filled clefts rather than due to large transmembrane movements of s4. it is based on experimental studies
using luminescence resonance energy transfer (lret) probes to
measure distances between probes attached to the sh s4 segment
and on the findings of proton pores formed through the voltage
sensor at negative and positive voltages when the first and fourth
arginines of the sh s4 segment are replaced with histidine. this
model does not stipulate whether or not s4 is exposed to lipids. a
crystal structure of the voltage-sensing domain in a resting
conformation may be required to determine which, if any, of
these models is correct. for detailed discussions and reviews of
current experimental data and structural models, see ahern and
horn (2004), durell et al. (2004), shrivastava et al. (2004),
swartz (2004), long et al. (2005a, 2005b), and service (2005).
currently, crystal structures have been determined for the
pore-forming domain of 5 k+ channels. bacterial non-voltagegated k+ channel (kcsa; from streptomyces lividans) and
bacterial  xxxg1249xxx  (kirbac1.1) (kuo et al.,
2003) appeared to be crystallized in their closed states, whereas
mthk (from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum), kvap,
and  xxxg1231xxx  are in open states. differences among these structures
suggest that opening of the pore involves the binding of the m2
(in 2tm) or the s6 (in 6tm) helices in a region occupied by a
highly conserved glycine near the center of the s4 segment. this
binding allows the more cytoplasmic c-terminus half of s6 to
swing away from the pore. the  xxxg1231xxx  crystal structure reveals a
second hinge region in the vicinity of the 2 proline residues.
3. molecular pharmacology of kv channels
3.1. overview of kv channel blockers
chemical agents capable of blocking or modulating kv
channels fall into 1 of 3 general categories, organic compounds,
venom-derived peptide toxins, or charged elements. see table 2
for a compilation of known kv blockers in each category. of
these, various organic compounds and venom-derived peptide
toxins have served as long-standing primary tools in experimental separation of the nerve impulse into its component
sodium (na+) and k+ currents and as an early means of
pharmacologically classifying different types of k+ channels.
the current use of kv channel blockers encompasses roles as

3.2. biophysical and molecular
mechanisms of  xxxd1804xxx  blockade in kv channels
aminopyridines and  xxxd1804xxx , in particular, block a wide variety
of kv channels (for a review, see hille, 2001) having greater
potency in slowly inactivating or non-inactivating (commonly
referred to as delayed rectifiers or dr) than in rapidly
inactivating (commonly referred to as a-type channels) kv

channels (stühmer et al., 1989). the sensitivity of cloned kv
channels to block by  xxxd1804xxx  has been measured in most members
of the kv1 – kv4 subfamilies with potencies ranging between
micromolar (am) and millimolar (mm) concentrations (see
table 3 for kv potencies). not all members of a given subfamily
share the same  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity; within the kv1 subfamily some
kv1 channels are sensitive to micromolar  xxxd1804xxx  concentrations
but many are sensitive only to millimolar concentrations, as in
the case of  xxxg1233xxx . this parallels the physiological studies, which
suggested heterogeneity among channels sensitive to  xxxd1804xxx .
3.2.1. aminopyridines bind to cytoplasmic
side of the ion translocation pore in kv channels
 xxxd1804xxx  blocks in the cationic form from the intracellular face
of the channel (cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane). block
depends on the preparation employed, time of exposure and
voltage-clamp protocol. prior to the cloning of k+ channels, the
 xxxd1804xxx  binding site in kv channels was localized to the
cytoplasmic side of the ion translocation pore (fig. 2e). a kv
channel derived from murine lymphocytes was blocked by
extracellular  xxxd1804xxx  in inside-out but not in outside-out patches
(choquet & korn, 1992). this was confirmed by whole-cell
studies showing that  xxxd1804xxx -methiodide, which does not cross the
membrane, blocked a cloned murine kv1 channel when applied
intracellularly but not when applied extracellularly (stephens et
al., 1994). furthermore,  xxxd1804xxx  was shown to compete with the
n-terminal  xxxg1070xxx  that is known to be on the
cytoplasmic side of the channel, suggesting that they compete
for the same or adjacent sites (stephens et al., 1994).

the molecular basis for  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity in kv channels was
first examined in mutagenesis studies focusing on amino acids
located in the inner mouth of the ion translocation pore. in 1991,
mccormack et al. demonstrated that substitution of the 2nd
heptad leucine with valine in the leucine heptad repeat region of
a slowly inactivating kv channel (a highly conserved k+ feature
of 5 leucine repeats every seventh amino acid that spans the
s4– s5 linker between segments s4 and s5) increased channel
sensitivity to block by  xxxd1804xxx . in a subsequent study, kirsch et al.
(1993) conferred the native high  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity of a rat  xxxg1239xxx 
to a rat  xxxg1237xxx  channel (low native  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity) by
swapping cytoplasmic regions containing the 5v end of the s5
transmembrane together with the 3v end of s6 segment.
subsequent studies in the rat  xxxg1237xxx  kv channel showed that
substituting phenylalanine for the 4th heptad leucine (located at
the 5v end of s5 segment near the intracellular mouth of the
pore) caused a 29-fold increase in  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity (shieh &
kirsch, 1994). an analogous mutation in a rapidly inactivating
human brain  xxxg1233xxx , however, produced a 400-fold increase in 4ap block (judge et al., 1999).
3.2.2. mechanisms of kv channel blockade by  xxxd1804xxx 
the mechanism of kv current blockade by  xxxd1804xxx  is
complicated and depends on such factors as the frequency of
stimulation and the kinetic state of the channel (yeh et al., 1976;
kirsch et al., 1986; wagoner & oxford, 1990; choquet & korn,
1992; kirsch & drewe, 1993; yao & tseng, 1993; mccormack
et al., 1994). the current gating processes of activation,
deactivation, and inactivation are all known to play a role in

to compare  xxxd1804xxx ’s ic50 values between channels, it is important to take into account differences in the state dependence of  xxxd1804xxx  binding and the kinetics of channel
gating. the apparent  xxxd1804xxx  binding affinity would depend on the voltage-clamp protocol. it is possible that the  xxxd1804xxx  binding site and the activation gate coincide with
each other in k channels.

modulating  xxxd1804xxx  block. for instance, in certain kv channels, 4ap can exhibit resting block or frequency-dependent block.
early electrophysiological studies of  xxxd1804xxx  block in native
delayed rectifier type kv channels, in the axonal membrane of
squid, showed a frequency-dependent relief of block suggesting that  xxxd1804xxx  bound to closed channels (yeh et al., 1976) or
closed channels just prior to opening (kirsch et al., 1986).
conflicting results later emerged in a study of gh3 pituitary
cells in which a frequency-dependent block was identified
(wagoner & oxford, 1990), whereas a subsequent study of
delayed rectifiers in lipopolysaccharide-activated lymphocytes
suggested that  xxxd1804xxx  blocked the channel in its open state and
became trapped in the channel once it closed or inactivated
(choquet & korn, 1992).
in a study comparing a  xxxg1239xxx  (higher  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity) with
a  xxxg1237xxx  (lower  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity), faster deactivation kinetics
were associated with high  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity (kirsch et al., 1993;
kirsch & drewe, 1993), whereas, conversely, chimeric mutants
in which segments from  xxxg1239xxx  replaced corresponding  xxxg1237xxx 
segments showed that slower deactivation kinetics were
correlated with a reduction in sensitivity to  xxxd1804xxx  block (kirsch
et al., 1993). in particular, it was shown that the ‘‘on’’ rate was
accelerated by channel opening with  xxxd1804xxx  becoming trapped in
the channel when it inactivated; the channel with greater  xxxd1804xxx 
sensitivity had a slower ‘‘off’’ rate. this study suggested that
the  xxxd1804xxx  binding site was in the 3v s6 segment and that a
region in the 5v s5 segment ‘‘traps’’ bound  xxxd1804xxx . soon
thereafter, another study demonstrated that channel activation
accelerated  xxxd1804xxx  dissociation from a  xxxg1229xxx  channel confirming
that the charged form of  xxxd1804xxx  was responsible for channel
block (castle et al., 1994a). the binding site of  xxxd1804xxx  and the
dependence of binding on the state of the channel manifesting
as frequency-dependent block and unblock have not yet been
clearly defined. channel activation was found to accelerate 4ap dissociation from a  xxxg1229xxx  channel (castle et al., 1994a,
1994b), and  xxxd1804xxx  had a slower ‘‘off’’ rate in the channel with
greater  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity (kirsch & drewe, 1993).
prior to studies examining the role of the leucine heptad
repeat region in determining the sensitivity of the rapidly
inactivation  xxxg1233xxx  channel to block by  xxxd1804xxx  (judge et al.,
1999, 2002), the molecular basis of  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity had only
been studied in slowly inactivating delayed rectifier types of kv
channels, even though  xxxd1804xxx  was also known to compete with
fast inactivation in rapidly inactivating a-type kv channels
(thompson, 1982; wagoner & oxford, 1990; stephens et al.,
1994; yao & tseng, 1994). accumulated evidence had
supported localization of both the  xxxd1804xxx  (kirsch & narahashi,
1983; kirsch et al., 1986; stephens et al., 1994; rasmusson et
al., 1995a, 1995b) and kv channel inactivation gate (stephens
et al., 1994; liu et al., 1996) binding sites to the cytoplasmic
side of the ion translocation pore. n-type inactivation had also
been slowed or eliminated by deletion of the n-terminal
inactivation peptide (commonly referred to as the inactivation
gate) in various a-type channels (hoshi et al., 1990; vandongen et al., 1990; tseng-crank et al., 1993; stephens et al.,
1994; liu et al., 1996), or by intracellular application of
various channel modifying agents, which modify the n-

237

terminal inactivation particle (wagoner & oxford, 1990) or
compete for its binding site (armstrong, 1971; yeh et al., 1976;
shapiro, 1977; cahalan, 1978; choi et al., 1991). furthermore,
point mutations in the s4 – s5 linker had been shown to slow or
remove n-type inactivation suggesting that the s4– s5 linker is
part of the binding site for the n-terminal ‘‘ball’’ (mccormack
et al., 1991; isacoff et al., 1991, 1993; kirsch & drewe, 1993;
slessinger et al., 1993; nunoki et al., 1994), with l4 being the
only heptad leucine known to slow inactivation (isacoff et al.,
1991). additionally, the leucines in the leucine heptad repeat
play a significant role in modulating the stability of channel
open and closed state conformations. point mutations of
individual heptad leucines to valine produced opposing effects
on channel voltage dependence, current gating, and  xxxd1804xxx 
sensitivity, depending on whether the leucines were located at
the 3v or 5v end of the repeat (mccormack et al., 1991, 1994).
individual phenylalanine-for-heptad leucine substitutions in
 xxxg1233xxx  resulted in mutant channels that exhibited stronger
stabilization of the closed state and greater affinity for  xxxd1804xxx 
than the parent wild type channel. specifically, the increased 4ap sensitivity observed in the l1f, l2f, l4f and l5f mutant
constructs likely resulted from the altered channel conformations produced by these amino acid substitutions alone,
whereas that of the l3f mutant may have involved additional
effects. these results are consistent with models for the
mechanism by which  xxxd1804xxx  blocks kv channels (armstrong
& loboda, 2001; loboda & armstrong, 2001). based on
gating current experiments in native and mutant sh kv
channels, armstrong and loboda proposed that  xxxd1804xxx , once
gaining access to the channel pore, exerts its action by
promoting closure of the channel activation gate. thereby,
even in the face of only minor acceleration of channel
deactivation in l3f, the effect of  xxxd1804xxx  on the activation gate
together with the increased stabilization of the channel closed
state could contribute to an enhancement of  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity.
3.3. venom-derived peptide toxins targeting kv channels
the venoms of various snakes, scorpions, spiders, marine
cone snails, and sea anemones have yielded and continue to
yield peptide toxins that are highly potent and highly selective
blockers of various classes of ion channels, including k+
channel-targeting peptides (fletcher et al., 1999; kem et al.,
1999; possani et al., 1999; garcia et al., 2001; olivera & cruz,
2001; lewis & garcia, 2003; rodrı́guez de la vega & possani,
2004; terlau & olivera, 2004; gazarian et al., 2005). it is this
exquisite specificity and sensitivity of venom-derived peptide
toxins for distinct ion channels that have enabled the isolation
and purification of channel proteins and have propelled major
advances in the understanding of different ion channel
structures and functions. venom-derived peptide toxins targeting ion channels, in general, and kv channels, in particular (see
table 2 for general listing and table 4 for potencies in
mammalian cells), are recognized as subdividing into 3 general
categories based on the length of their amino acid sequences:
small (¨ 18– 31 amino acids), intermediate (¨ 37 –39 amino
acids), and large (> 50 amino acids) peptide toxins (for reviews,

al., 2000; lewis & garcia, 2003; mouhat et al., 2004a;
rodrı́guez de la vega & possani, 2004). interestingly, these
size-delineated categories seem to correlate also with the
species of origin for venom-derived peptide toxins; spider and
marine cone snail toxins being small, scorpion and sea anemone
toxins intermediate, and snake toxins large. as poisonous
agents, all toxins, including venom-derived peptide toxins,
constitute deadly biologic defense mechanisms of extensive
evolutionary diversification; both in terms of the number of
organisms producing toxins and the number of different toxic
molecules that, for instance, a single venom can contain. it is
estimated that, together, all scorpions likely produce upwards of
100,000 different toxins (gazarian et al., 2005). to date, of
those venomous species producing kv-targeting peptide toxins,
there have been identified a total of 495 distinct toxins in 100
different species of snakes, 306 toxins in 41 species of
scorpions, 210 toxins in 48 species of spiders, 51 toxins in 26
species of cone snails, and 47 toxins in 17 species of sea
anemones (rodrı́guez de la vega & possani, 2004; jungo &
bairoch, 2005). scorpion peptide toxins have been further
subdivided into the 4 a-, h-, g-, and n-ktx families according
to the classification and nomenclature originated by tytgat et al.
(1999) (table 2; middle column).
3.3.1. sites and mechanisms of
peptide toxins blockade in kv channels
venom-derived peptide toxins, in general terms, are small
compact globular proteins with tertiary structures comprised of
varying combinations of folded a-helices and/or h-strands that
are stabilized by the presence of varying numbers of cysteine
residues and 2 –4 disulfide bridges (for reviews, see darbon &
sabatier, 1999, tenenholz et al., 2000; jouirou et al., 2004;
mouhat et al., 2004a). the early to mid-1980s ushered in a new
era of k+ channel studies with the discovery of peptide toxins
that are highly selective and potent blockers of k+ channels.
beginning with the identification and purification of the snakederived peptide toxin, dendrotoxin (dtx) (harvey & karlsson,
1980, 1982), and 2 scorpion-derived peptide toxins, first
noxiustoxin (nxtx) (possani et al., 1982) and then charybdotoxin (chtx) (miller et al., 1985; smith et al., 1986; gimenezgallego et al., 1988), hence began the ongoing discovery and
expanding use of venom-derived peptide toxins as k+ channel
probes. the discoveries of dtx, nxtx, and chtx occurred
just a few years prior to the cloning first of a sodium (na+)
channel (noda et al., 1986a, 1986b) and then the 1987 –1988
cloning of a k+ channel (see section 2). although tetrodotoxin
(ttx; high affinity na+ channel blocking toxin) is a bacterial
toxin and not a venom-derived peptide toxin, it is of historical
interest to note that the first discoveries of high affinity k+
channel blocking toxins came nearly 80 years after the original
extraction of ttx from puffer fish (tawara, 1909), and over 20
years following the landmark use of ttx by narahashi et al.
(1964), revealing for the first time that the nerve action
potential is composed of separate na+ and k+ currents flowing
through discrete na+ and k+ ion channels (for a personal
review, see moore, 1965; for a general review, see hille, 2001).

venom-derived peptide toxins produce effects in k+
channels by 1 of 2 general mechanisms. either they bind on
the extracellular mouth of the ion translocation pore (fig. 2f)
thereby occluding the pore, or they bind to and modulate the
voltage sensor region of the k+ channel after partitioning into
the lipid bilayer (fig. 2g). the binding of chtx and dtx has
been studied in considerable detail in kv1 channels. chtx, a
scorpion venom toxin that inhibits kv channels as well as kca
channels (for a reviews, see chandy et al., 1990; garcia et al.,
1991, 1998b; tenenholz et al., 2000), was shown by segmental
transfer experiments to bind in the kv channel h5 or p region
(mackinnon & miller, 1989). one amino acid located outside
the p region and 3 amino acids located in the p region were
identified by site-directed mutagenesis that are involved in
chtx binding (mackinnon et al., 1988, 1990; goldstein et al.,
1994), and early predictions of toxin – channel interaction
surfaces (stampe et al., 1994). dtx, a venom-derived peptide
from the eastern green mamba snake, was shown to bind to a
site that overlaps the chtx binding site on the extracellular
portion of the ion translocation pore by studies of segmental
transfer (kirsch et al., 1992). using site-directed mutagenesis
in combination with mutant cycle analysis techniques, progress
was made in deducing the critical amino acids involved at the
structural surface between dtx and their binding site at the
extracellular surface of the ion translocation pore in certain kv
channels (hidalgo & mackinnon, 1995; imredy & mackinnon, 2000). also, some amino acid mutations outside the p
region that do not alter chtx binding do decrease dtx
binding (hurst et al., 1991). for a detailed review of venomderived peptide toxin blockade in k+ channels, see garcia et al.
(1998a). having garnered public attention due to largely
anecdotal reports of ‘‘bee sting therapy’’ as a treatment for
ms patients, in some areas of the united states, the mechanism
of action of mast cell degranulating peptide (mcdp), a venomderived peptide from the european honeybee (ziai et al., 1990),
is of relevant interest. mcdp blocks both rapidly inactivating
(a-type) and non-inactivating or slowly inactivating (delayed
rectifier types) kv channels (brau et al., 1990; stansfeld et al.,
1987). detailed studies of the binding site for mcdp have not
been reported but the binding site appears to be on the
extracellular portion of the channel (werkman et al., 1992).
one study found similar sensitivities of a series of cloned kv
channels to dtx and mcdp suggesting a common binding
site (rehm & tempel, 1991).
although structurally different molecules, the peptide toxin
kv channel blockers, dtx, chtx and mcdp all appeared to
act through a similar mechanism of binding to an extracellular
portion of the ion translocation pore. these initial investigations into chtx and dtx binding in kv1 channels laid the
groundwork leading to the current ‘‘functional diad’’ model
(dauplais et al., 1997; savarin et al., 1998) of how scorpion,
snake and sea anemone peptide toxins (but not cone snail
peptide toxins), with different tertiary structures, exert similar
blockade in kv channels (for reviews, see ménez, 1998;
gasparini et al., 2004; jouirou et al., 2004; mouhat et al.,
2004b; gilquin et al., 2005). using nmr spectroscopy,
competition binding, and molecular modeling, investigations

s.i.v. judge, c.t. bever jr. / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 224 – 259

of the sea anemone venom peptide from bunodosoma
granulifera (bgk; dauplais et al., 1997) and the snake toxin
a-dtx (gasparini et al., 1998) were the first to yield 3dimensional structures revealing functional diads comparable
with chtx (scorpion). this functional diad is comprised of a
critical lysine residue (thought to effect toxin positioning in the
channel pore) and an aromatic residue separated by ¨ 6 å
(miller, 1995; dauplais et al., 1997; gasparini et al., 1998).
however, this functional diad does not appear to be a shared
feature of the kv-targeting cone snail toxin, conotoxin (npviia; savarin et al., 1998). as suggested by the earlier chtx
and dtx studies (mackinnon & miller, 1988; hurst et al.,
1991; stocker et al., 1991), the current view suggests that it is
this commonly recurring feature of a functional amino acid
diad, located on the surfaces of differently folded scorpion,
snake and sea anemone peptide toxins (for a review, see
mouhat et al., 2004b), that likely enables toxins of dissimilar 3dimensional structures to anchor on the s5 – s6 loop in the p
region of kv1 channels (gilquin et al., 2005). it is further
suggested that an additional 3 functional residues are probable
determinants of the affinity and specificity differences exhibited by these toxins for various kv channel subtypes (dauplais
et al., 1997; gasparini et al., 1998; savarin et al., 1998).
in addition to the predominant pore-blocking peptide toxins
(scorpion, snake, marine cone snail and sea anemone), spiderderived peptide toxins have been identified that inhibit kv
channels by interacting with the voltage sensor region (see
table 2 for general listing; see table 4 for potencies in
mammalian cells) instead of binding on the external mouth of
the pore region. such voltage sensor toxins have been isolated
from the venoms of various species of tarantula including
hanatoxins (hatx; swartz & mackinnon, 1995), phrixotoxins
(diochot et al., 1999), t. leblondi toxins (ebbinghaus et al.,
2004; legros et al., 2004), heteropodatoxins (sanguinetti et
al., 1997) and spider venom peptides from chilean rose
tarantula (vstx1, vstx2, and vstx3; ruta et al., 2003; lee
& mackinnon, 2004; ruta & mackinnon, 2004). characteristically, the effects of voltage sensor-modifying toxins, in kv
channels, are associated with changes that increase the stability
of the channel-closed state. these spider toxins produce 1)
depolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of current
activation (i.e., more depolarization of the transmembrane
potential required to open channels), and 2) an acceleration of
current deactivation kinetics (i.e., channels close faster)
(sanguinetti et al., 1997; swartz & mackinnon, 1997a,
1997b; diochot et al., 1999; ruta et al., 2003; ebbinghaus
et al., 2004; legros et al., 2004). studies of the hanatoxins
hatx1 and hatx2 in kv channels first localized the voltage
sensor-binding site to a conserved structural motif located in
the kv s3 – s4 linker (swartz & mackinnon, 1997a, 1997b;
li-smerin & swartz, 1998; lou et al., 2002, 2003). later
studies in the bacterial kvap channel showed that the
mechanism of spider voltage sensor toxins appears to be that
of high-affinity blockade with slow rates of equilibrium due to
binding to the s3b segment of the voltage sensor after
partitioning into the lipid bilayer (lee & mackinnon, 2004;
ruta & mackinnon, 2004). in a recent review of voltage

241

sensor toxins (also known as gate modifiers), maria l. garcia
(2004) points out that it is not yet clear if all gate-modifying
toxins partition into the lipid bilayer, and that current
pharmaceutical strategies (based on drug-channel structural
interactions) for developing the pore-blocking toxins as
potential therapeutic drugs will likely not apply to voltage
sensor toxins because such properties as non-specific membrane partitioning add another layer of complexity to the
nature of toxin affinity for k+ channels.
3.3.2. therapeutic potential of venom-derived peptide toxins
it is the exquisite kv selectivity and potency of many venomderived peptide toxins that also recommends them as potential
clinical treatments in various diseases and clinical disorders. in
particular, such peptide toxins as dtx (snake), margatoxin
(mgtx; scorpion), kaliotoxin (ktx; scorpion), and sea
anemone venom peptide from stichodactyla helianthus (shk;
sea anemone) have exhibited beneficial neurologic effects in
various experimental animal preparations and models (harvey
& gage, 1981; harvey & anderson, 1985; halliwell et al.,
1986; silveira et al., 1988a, 1988b; uitdehaag et al., 1994,
bagust et al., 1997; koo et al., 1997; beeton et al., 2001a,
2001b), thereby advancing them as possible therapeutic
interventions in ms. nonetheless, to date, only the 2 aminopyridine organic compounds,  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap, have been tested
in patients with ms. this not withstanding, various issues
surround the development of venom-derived peptide toxins as
putative therapeutics that can be divided, broadly, into the 2
general areas: pharmaceutical production and clinical use (for
excellent discussion and overview, see lewis & garcia, 2003).
with regard to the systemic administration of various peptide
toxins, proteolytic degradation of toxins in the blood and the
inability of toxins to pass the blood – brain barrier (bbb) have
handicapped their development as therapeutic interventions in
ms and other neurodegenerative diseases. the recent development of a synthetic analogue of shk with improved plasma
stability suggests that such limitations may yet be resolved
(beeton et al., 2005). the scorpion peptide toxin osk1 (from
orthochirus scrobiculosus) is an even more potent  xxxg1232xxx 
blocker than shk (see table 4), from which mouhat et al.
(2005) have also synthesized a synthetic analogue of even
greater potency [k16,d20]-osk1. in determining the lethal
doses (ld50) for osk1 and their synthetic analogues (in mice),
mouhat et al. (2005) demonstrated that intracerebroventricular
injections produced toxic epileptogenic tremors effects comparable with inoculation (osk1 ld50 estimated to be equivalent
to a concentration of 20 nm osk1 in brain). these results are in
keeping with earlier in vivo experimental testing of dendrotoxins (from dendroaspis angusticeps) also showing, similarly to
clinically administered aminopyridines, that toxins can produce
both beneficial neurophysiologic (harvey & gage, 1981;
harvey & anderson, 1985; halliwell et al., 1986; silveira et
al., 1988a, 1988b; bagust et al., 1997) and toxic epileptogenic
(collier et al., 1981; black et al., 1986; stansfeld et al., 1986;
velluti et al., 1987) effects.
two interesting experimental studies (scorpion venom
effects on neuronal action potentials) and 1 clinical observation

242

s.i.v. judge, c.t. bever jr. / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 224 – 259

(apitherapy benefit of scorpion venom in ms) were reported
well before the cloning of k+ channels or the isolation of the
highly potent k+ channel blocking peptide, ctx, from the
venom of the scorpion leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus
(table 4). anticipating an effect on na+ channels, this scorpion
venom was shown to prolong the action potential duration in
both myelinated frog nerve (adam et al., 1966) and demyelinated rat ventral root fibers (bostock et al., 1978), raising the
attention of 2 ms clinicians who, as a consequence, reported
progressive improvements leading to 2-months completely free
of all symptoms in an ms patient who had been bitten by an
unidentified scorpion; all ms symptoms gradually returned
(breland & currier, 1983). in retrospect, such effects likely
resulted from blockade of members of the kv1 family of
voltage-gated k+ channels.
regarding fbee sting therapy_ in ms, it should be noted that
much of the available evidence of benefit to ms patients is
anecdotal and that there are no reported controlled trials of bee
venom in ms. furthermore, it is unlikely that the local injections
of  xxxd2216xxx  lead to measurable systemic levels of mcdp.
4. demyelinating lesions and roles of
neuronal kv channels in multiple sclerosis
the tremendous accumulating knowledge base of kv
channel structure, function and pharmacology now propelling
broad-based efforts to develop clinical strategies for therapeutically targeting kv channels, to overcome ms neurologic
dysfunction arising from conduction abnormalities, finds its
foundation in earlier twentieth century studies that are classic
examples of insightful and elegant science (in the membrane
biophysics of nerve excitation and conduction). two important
eras should be noted, roughly delineated as the 1930s –1950s
and the 1960s – 1980s.
the first era is often referred to as fclassical biophysics_
beginning with the 1935 arrival of andrew huxley at trinity
college, cambridge (as an undergraduate). it was in this same
year that alan hodgkin graduated from trinity college and
commenced his research yielding, within 1 year, the first
experimental demonstration that the nerve impulse or action
potential is preceded by spreading electrical stimulation,
explaining the mechanism underlying propagation of the action
potential along the nerve fiber (hodgkin, 1937a, 1937b).
overall, this first period encompassed both the development
and the proof the fionic theory of excitation_ through the works
of kenneth s. cole and howard j. curtis (cole & curtis, 1939;
cole, 1949), and those of alan l. hodgkin, andrew f. huxley
and bernard katz (hodgkin, 1937a, 1937b, 1952a, 1952b;
hodgkin & huxley, 1939, 1945, 1952; hodgkin et al., 1949) ,
as well as the first demonstrations of saltatory conduction in
vertebrate myelinated nerves (tasaki & takeuchi, 1941, 1942;
huxley & stämpfli, 1949). although this period is often
considered to culminate with the 1952 publication of the
hodgkin-huxley (hh) model that mathematically describes
na+ and k+ ionic conductances underlying the action potential
in the squid giant axon (hodgkin & huxley, 1952), the end of
the 1950s and early 1960s witnessed continued advancements

in the understanding of ionic currents including development of
the voltage clamp technique for nodes of ranvier (dodge &
frankenhaeuser, 1958, 1959). the hh model has recently been
revisited and revisions have been proposed to more accurately
describe the dynamic processes of neuronal computation, in the
mathematically reconstructed action potential (aguera y arcas
et al., 2003; clay, 2005). for personal reviews, see cole
(1968a, 1968b) and huxley (1995, 2002). for a detailed
review, see hille (2001).
proof of the fionic theory of excitation_ set the stage for the
second era that began by exploring how the hh model of
mathematically described na+ and k+ transmembrane permeability changes and fluxes actually occurred. overall, this
second period encompassed multiple series of elegant overlapping studies into the distribution and function of na+ and k+
channels in myelinated and demyelinated axons, that preceded
both the cloning of ion channels and the discoveries of k+
channel-selective peptide toxins now driving present day
continuations of these earlier studies. extending into the early
to mid-1980s, this period can be viewed as concluding soon
after the advent of the patch clamp technique (neher &
sakmann, 1976; hamill et al., 1981) that enabled whole-cell
and single-channel voltage-clamp studies of ion channels in
mammalian tissue, for the first time (for detailed reviews, see
sakmann & neher, 1995; hille, 2001). the original investigations of na+ and k+ channel distribution and the ultrastructure
of myelinated and demyelinated axons centered around the
works of shing-yan chiu, j. murdoch ritchie, r.d. keynes,
richard b. rogart, stephen g. waxman, d. c. quick, r. e.

myelinated, demyelinated and remyelinated nerve fiber conduction properties centered around the works of b. frankenhaeuser, andrew f. huxley, f. a. dodge, hugh bostock,

r. schwartz, w. vogel, s. l. wood, j. d. kocsis, j. a. ruiz
and c. hildebrand. proof that the hh model predictions of
discrete na+ and k+ transmembrane pathways were true came
with the arrival of toshio narahashi (bringing ttx) in john w.
moore’s lab at duke university medical school, durham.
using the lobster giant axon and the sucrose-gap variation of
the voltage-clamp technique, they, for the first time, pharmacologically dissected the nerve impulse (narahashi et al., 1964)
by selectively blocking the na+ current and revealing the
separate k+ current, thus beginning the long tradition of using
pharmacologic agents as probes of ion channels. for detailed
reviews, see ritchie and chiu (1981), sears and bostock

(1994), vogel and schwarz (1995), hille (2001), and waxman
(1995, 2005).
4.1. features of demyelination and demyelinating diseases
ms was first described as an example of a neurologic
disease that correlated with anatomically identifiable lesions
localized in the spinal cord (fsystematic lesions_) by jeanmartin charcot, the french neurologist credited with founding
neurology as a science, in his series of 17 lectures that formed
his 1879– 1880 course ‘‘pathological anatomy of the nervous
system’’ (charcot, 1881). in his lectures, charcot emphasized
lesions of the gray matter but also included discussions of
white matter lesions, ‘‘without the gray substance’’, in which he
described ms as a ‘‘disease known as multilocular induration
of the nervous centres’’ using the term ‘‘sclerose en plaques’’,
coined by his former teacher jean cruveilhier in the 1840s, for
ms demyelinating lesions.
although ms encompasses varying disease courses and
symptomatologies (mcfarlin & macfarland, 1982), several
pathologic ultrastructural features are recognized as hallmark
characteristics of demyelination. these include 1) myelin
vacuolation that may be associated with degeneration of
oligodendrocytes, in which there is a splitting of the myelin
sheath; 2) the actual loss of myelin wherein active stripping of
the myelin sheath is mediated by macrophages; and, in some
cases, 3) the presence of a fdying-back gliopathy_ in which the
inner tongue of the myelinating oligodendrocytes degenerates
first (ludwin, 1995). in ms, demyelinating lesions occur in
white matter, the junction between white and gray matter, as
well as in perivascular spaces within the cerebral hemispheres,
brain stem and spinal cord of the cns (ludwin, 1995).
although ms is not the only neurologic disease or disorder
characterized by demyelination, it is viewed as the fhuman
prototype_ for demyelinating diseases in which there is a
pathologic loss of myelin resulting from either direct destruction
of the myelin sheath or oligodendrocytes leading to myelin
damage (ludwin, 1981), and should be distinguished from
other conditions in which a loss of myelin occurs yet are not
classified as demyelinating diseases (raine, 1984a, 1984b).
five classifications of demyelinating diseases have been
identified; a number of the animal diseases within these
categories serve as experimental models of ms. class i:
acquired allergic/viral demyelinating diseases including ms,
guillian-barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute post-infectious encephalomyelitis and progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) (in humans), and
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), experimental autoimmune neuritis (ean), jhm mouse hepatitis virus
encephalomyelitis and theiler’s virus encephalopathy (in
animals). class ii: hereditary metabolic demyelinating diseases
such as metachromatic leukodystropy, krabbe’s disease, adrenoleukodystrophy and phenylketonuria (in humans), and jimpy
or quaking mice (in animals). class iii: toxic or metabolic
demyelinating diseases including  xxxd2274xxx  neuropathy
and hypoxic encephalopathy (in humans), and toxicity to
cuprizone, ethidium bromide,  xxxd2274xxx , triethyltin,

243

diphtheria toxin, lysolecithin or ay9944 (in animals). class
iv: nutritionally induced demyelinating diseases like  xxxd3049xxx 
or b12 deficiencies, central pontine myelinolysis and marchiafava – bignami disease in humans. class v: physical/traumatic
demyelinating diseases such as cerebrospinal fluid barbotage,
mechanical compression or changes in local pressure (in both
humans and animals). for further listings of demyelinating
diseases and detailed discussions of myelin molecular organization, morphology, myelination and types of demyelinating
lesions, see ludwin (1981, 1995), braun (1984), norton and
cammer (1984), raine (1984a, 1984b), traugott and raine
(1984) and hildebrand and mohseni (2005). for early single
fiber morphological study of cns demyelination and remyelination, see gledhill and mcdonald (1977).
4.2. kv channel distribution in multiple
sclerosis demyelinating and remyelinating lesions
in vertebrate nervous systems, all large axons are myelinated;
a metabolically cost-efficient, evolutionary development that
enables action potentials to be generated and propagated with
less ionic conductance and at greater speed than in nonmyelinated axons (for a review, see hille, 2001). myelination
results in a redistribution of axonally expressed kv channels as
compared with non-myelinated axons, and, until recently,
rendered the internodal axonal membrane, beneath the myelin
sheath, inaccessible to study of its channel composition and
electrophysiologic properties. early evidence of selective ion
channel expression, in different regions of myelinated axons,
was generated by studies using freeze-fracture, ferric ion
ferrocyanide staining, and [3h] saxitoxin binding techniques
(for a review, see shrager & wu, 1994). using kv-specific
antibodies, recent co-immunolocalization studies have now
delineated the differential expression of homotetrameric kv
channels in nodes of ranvier (cns: kv3.1b, a splice variant of
 xxxg1239xxx , and  xxxg1269xxx  channels) and heterotetrameric kv channels,
co-assembled with up to 4 kvh2 accessory subunits thought to
promote channel surface membrane expression (rhodes et al.,
1996, 1997; shi et al., 1996; gu et al., 2003), in juxtaparanodal
regions (cns:  xxxg1229xxx / xxxg1231xxx /kvh2 and  xxxg1231xxx / xxxg1233xxx /kvh2 channel complexes) in myelinated axons, as well as differences
exhibited between pns and cns fibers (fig. 3). it is this
existence of heterotetrameric kv channels (wang et al., 1993;
sheng et al., 1993; koch et al., 1997) and kv channel splice
variants (lunea et al., 1991) that contributes to the complexity of
cns neuronal kv channels and underlies the vast diversity of kv
currents observed in the brain. for detailed discussions and
reviews of kv distribution in myelinated axons, see waxman
(1995), rudy et al. (1999), arroyo and scherer (2000), peles and
salzer (2000), rasband et al. (1999), rasband and shrager

dodson and forsythe (2004), and rasband (2004, 2005).
studies examining the effects of demyelination and remyelination on the expression of kv1 channels were first performed
in the pns using experimental lysolecithin-demyelinated
sciatic nerve and revealed that juxtaparanodal kv1 channels
diffused into former paranodal and internodal regions of the

axolemma (rasband et al., 1998). similar diffusion of cns
kv1 channels has also been observed in a transgenic mouse that
more closely resembles demyelination in ms (kagawa et al.,
1994; baba et al., 1999). with remyelination, rasband et al.
(1998) showed that newly forming nodal regions initially
lacked kv1 channels, but was followed by a period of high kv1
channel expression in nodal membrane, and then a redistribution of the kv1 channels to first paranodal and, ultimately, back
to juxtaparanodal regions of the remyelinated axon (rasband et
al., 1998). this changing kv1 distribution has been noted to
parallel the absence and presence of  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity in
demyelinated and remyelinated axons, respectively (for a
detailed discussion and review, see rasband, 2005). the
 xxxg1269xxx  subunit is a known component of the fm_ current in
the nervous system (okada et al., 2002) and is thought to be
important in the process of myelination (rasband, 2005) yet
few studies have been reported on the potency of current
blockade in this channel. however, to date,  xxxg1269xxx  is not
blocked by 2 mm  xxxd1804xxx , 100 nm ctx nor 100 nm apetx1
(from the sea anemone, anthopleura elegantissima) (yang et
al., 1998; diochot et al., 2003).

other subcellular regions of neurons also exhibit differential
kv expression: presynaptic terminals (delayed rectifier kv1 and
kv3 channels, and rapidly inactivating  xxxg1233xxx  channels); dendrites
(rapidly inactivating  xxxg1243xxx  channels); and the soma (delayed
rectifier kv3 and rapidly inactivating  xxxg1243xxx  channels).  xxxg1229xxx  and
 xxxg1231xxx  channels activate at transmembrane potentials near the
activation threshold for action potential generation and have been
shown to regulate action potential firing patterns in various
regions of the cns, whereas kv3 activate at more depolarized
potentials, contribute to the repolarization phase of the action
potential, and have been shown to regulate action potential
duration in some brain regions. for discussions and reviews, see
wang et al. (1994), brooke et al. (2004), frick and johnston
(2004), jerng et al. (2004), misonou et al. (2004), and magee and
johnston (2005). for well-integrated discussion and review of
differentially localized kv channels in neurons and brain, see
dodson and forsythe (2004). interestingly, of the 2 a-type
channels differentially expressed in neurons, native molecular
differences exist between  xxxg1233xxx  (axons and presynaptic terminals) and  xxxg1243xxx  (dendrites and soma) in the leucine heptad repeat
region:  xxxg1243xxx  contains phenylalanine at the position of the 1st

s.i.v. judge, c.t. bever jr. / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 224 – 259

heptad leucine, whereas in  xxxg1233xxx  all are heptad leucines. a-type
channels underlie opposing current blocking effects in these
channels by  xxxd1804xxx  versus small peptide toxins. a-type channels
enable dendritic, somatic, axon hillock, and sensory terminal
membranes in excitable tissue to encode graded stimuli as
frequency patterns of action potential firing. their recognized
ability to encode stimulus intensity distinguishes them from other
voltage-gated k+ channels (delayed rectifiers), which function as
followers permissively propagating action potentials generated
elsewhere. they are expressed throughout the cns with different
a-type isoforms expressing in different subsets of neurons, as
well as in differing regions within an individual neuron (for a
review, see north, 1995). cns neurons express a-type channels
in their soma, dendrites, axons, and axon terminals and have been
shown to exhibit differential subcellular localization of  xxxg1233xxx  to
axons and possibly axon terminals and of  xxxg1243xxx  to dendrites and
somata (sheng et al., 1992a, 1992b) in the same neurons. the
 xxxg1233xxx , kv4.1, and  xxxg1243xxx  a-type channels have been shown to coexpress in cholinergic interneurons with kv4.1 and  xxxg1243xxx 
predominantly co-expressing in the soma and dendrites (song
et al., 1998).  xxxg1233xxx  subunits can form heteromultimeric channels
with  xxxg1229xxx ,  xxxg1231xxx , and  xxxg1234xxx  subunits, retaining rapid inactivation and, in the case of  xxxg1233xxx / xxxg1231xxx  hybrid channels, the high 4ap sensitivity of the  xxxg1231xxx  parent channel (po et al., 1993). in
addition, in vivo evidence is available for the existence of
heterotetrameric  xxxg1233xxx / xxxg1231xxx  presynaptic channels in rat brain
(sheng et al., 1992a, 1992b) and  xxxg1229xxx / xxxg1231xxx  juxtaparanodal k+
channels in rodent spinal cords and sciatic nerves (arroyo &
scherer, 2000; arroyo et al., 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004; rasband,
2004; scherer & arroyo, 2002).
demyelinating lesions also contain various immune cells
that mediate the inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes
in ms (raine, 1994; markovic-plese & mcfarland, 2001); the
foundation of various current ms immune therapies (for
reviews and discussions, see martin et al., 1992, 2000,
2001). with the bbb compromised, macrophages, dendritic
cells (dc), and t-lymphocytes (t-cells) join resident microglia
in the cns of ms patients. macrophages, microglia, dc, and
t-cells all up-regulate  xxxg1232xxx  when fully activated, with
microglia differentially expressing  xxxg1234xxx  at earlier stages of
cellular activation (kotecha & schlichter, 1999), and dc
predominantly expressing  xxxg1234xxx  over  xxxg1232xxx  following activation (mullen et al., 2004). recently, ms brain has been shown
to exhibit high levels of  xxxg1232xxx  expression (rus et al., 2005). as
distinguished from the therapeutic targeting of neuronal kv
channels as a symptomatic treatment in ms, targeting immune
cell kv channels has been recognized as a promising clinical
intervention for immunomodulation of inflammatory processes
and as a possible means of limiting neurodegeneration in
patients with ms. for detailed reviews of k+ channels, see

4.3. function of  xxxd1804xxx -sensitive
kv channels in demyelinated and remyelinated neurons
early electrophysiologic studies of experimentally demyelinated pns nerves first showed that demyelinated axons are
capable of continuous conduction but that conduction block
occurred once a 25-fold increase in internodal conduction time
is surpassed (rasminsky & sears, 1972; bostock & sears,
1978). remyelination of experimentally demyelinated pns
fibers was later shown to restore conduction despite the shorter
length and thinner myelination of newly formed internodes
(smith & hall, 1980). subsequent studies revealed the
presence of abnormal kv currents in areas of demyelination
that decreased action potential duration and amplitude, thereby
contributing to conduction failure (for reviews, see waxman,
1982; waxman & ritchie, 1981; morell, 1984). for current
detailed discussions and reviews of the pathophysiology of
conduction in demyelinated and remyelinated axons, see chiu
(2005) and smith and waxman (2005).
in 1969, lemeignan et al. (1969) reported that  xxxd1804xxx 
increased extracellularly recorded action potential amplitude
and duration in frog sciatic nerve and in cat motor and sensory
nerves. using intracellular recordings of the cockroach giant
axon, pelhate et al. (1974) and pelhate and pichon (1974) were
able to show that action potential repolarization was slowed by
 xxxd1804xxx  suggesting an effect on k+ conductances. patch clamp
studies by both pelhate and pichon (1974), in the cockroach
giant axon, and by yeh et al. (1976), in the squid giant axon,
showed that  xxxd1804xxx  blocked k+ currents. thompson studied the
sensitivity of 3 k+ currents in molluscan neurons and found that
the rapidly inactivating voltage-sensitive current, which had
been designated the ‘‘a’’ current by connor and stevens (1971),
was the most sensitive (thompson, 1977). however, in the early
1980s, studies in pns (sherratt et al., 1980; kocsis & waxman,
1980, 1981; ritchie, 1981, 1982)- and cns (kocsis &
waxman, 1980, 1981)-myelinated fibers demonstrated that
applications of  xxxd1804xxx  did not substantially broaden the nerve
impulses. higher concentrations of  xxxd1804xxx  blocked the delayed
rectifier k+ current as well. a subpopulation of rat visceral
afferent neurons was found to have a voltage-sensitive
incompletely inactivating current, which was blocked by
micromolar concentrations of  xxxd1804xxx  (stansfeld et al., 1986,
1987). this current was also found to be sensitive to nanomolar
concentrations of dendrotoxin and has been referred to as idtx.
a similar but completely inactivating current, found in rat
hippocampal ca 1 neurons and shown to be responsible for
delayed activation (referred to as ‘‘id’’ or ‘‘d’’ current), was
sensitive to micromolar concentrations of  xxxd1804xxx  and nanomolar
concentrations of dendrotoxin (storm, 1988). together these
studies showed that several physiologically defined k+ currents
were blocked by  xxxd1804xxx  and that sensitivity varied from the
micromolar to the millimolar range.
the likely  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap targets underlying the
beneficial and toxic effects in clinical ms trials encompass
various members of several subfamilies in the family of kv
channels. such probable neuronal kv targets include the 4-apsensitive members of the kv1, kv3, and kv4 subfamilies of kv

246

channels. foremost among relevant homotetrameric channels are
 xxxg1229xxx  and  xxxg1231xxx  that exhibit altered distributions coincident with
changes in  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity (sherratt et al., 1980; pender, 1986;
rasband et al., 1998; nashmi et al., 2000), following demyelination.  xxxg1229xxx  and  xxxg1231xxx  channels normally reside sequestered
beneath the myelin sheath in regions (wang et al., 1993; rasband
et al., 1998; rasband & trimmer, 2001a, 2001b) where their
function is muted (chiu & ritchie, 1980), although  xxxg1229xxx  may
activate during action potential generation (smart et al., 1998).
seizure induction has been shown to result from  xxxd1804xxx  block of
an unidentified synaptic channel (perreault & avoli, 1991).
 xxxg1233xxx  is the only a-type channel identified in axons (sheng et al.,
1992a, 1992b) and it is a blockade of a paranodal or internodal atype channel that can prolong the action potential (debanne et al.,
1997; hlubek & cobbett, 2000), implicating the involvement of
this a-type channel subset in the beneficial and/or toxic
neurological effects observed following clinical treatment with
 xxxd1804xxx . in addition, heterotetrameric kv1 channels are expressed in
brain (koschak et al., 1998; coleman et al., 1999; rasband &
trimmer, 2001a) and spinal cord (rasband & trimmer, 2001b),
with juxtaparanodal  xxxg1229xxx – xxxg1231xxx  (wang et al., 1993) and
presynaptic  xxxg1233xxx – xxxg1231xxx  (po et al., 1993; sheng et al., 1992a,
1992b) channels.
 xxxd1804xxx  levels measured in ms patient sera, which have been in
the micromolar range, suggest that only the most highly
sensitive kv channels would be blocked (felts & smith,
1994). this argues against homotetrameric  xxxg1233xxx  a-type
channels subserving the neurological benefits but not the toxic
side effects resulting from the therapeutic use of  xxxd1804xxx . it
remains undetermined if other more highly  xxxd1804xxx -sensitive atype channels might be involved in these effects. however,
 xxxg1233xxx  subunits could be implicated in both effects if they
natively form heterotetrameric and homotetrameric channels.
block of heterotetrameric axonal or presynaptic a-type
channels, containing high  xxxd1804xxx -sensitive subunits in addition
to low  xxxd1804xxx -sensitive  xxxg1233xxx  subunits, would be consistent with
the benefits associated with  xxxd1804xxx  treatment. in vivo evidence
exists for heterotetrameric  xxxg1233xxx / xxxg1231xxx  axonal presynaptic
channels in rat brain (sheng et al., 1993) and  xxxg1229xxx / xxxg1231xxx 
juxtaparanodal kv channels in murine brain.  xxxg1233xxx  retains rapid
inactivation when forming in vitro heterotetrameric channels
with  xxxg1229xxx ,  xxxg1231xxx , or  xxxg1234xxx  subunits, but only the  xxxg1233xxx / xxxg1231xxx 
hybrid channel retains the high  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity of the  xxxg1231xxx 
parent channel (po et al., 1993). additionally, evidence from
these hybrid channels suggests that the presence of a single
 xxxg1233xxx  subunit is enough to endow hybrid channels with rapid
inactivation. while homotetrameric  xxxg1233xxx  channels, exhibiting
millimolar  xxxd1804xxx  sensitivity (judge et al., 1999), are inconsistent
with the beneficial neurological effects, the toxic epileptogenic
effects seen with  xxxd1804xxx  serum levels above 100 ng/ml (bever et
al., 1994; stork & hoffman, 1994) would be consistent with
block of homotetrameric presynaptic  xxxg1233xxx  channels. perreault
and avoli (1991) showed that seizure induction by  xxxd1804xxx  results
from block of a synaptic channel. thus, heterotetrameric axonal
or presynaptic a-type kv channels, containing  xxxg1233xxx  subunits,
may underlie the neurological benefits, whereas homotetrameric presynaptic  xxxg1233xxx  a-type kv channels may underlie the

clinically observed toxic effects resulting from  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4dap treatment.
5. clinical pharmacology in multiple sclerosis
the therapeutic use of  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap has a long history
predating their application in ms including treatments for
botulinum poisoning, post-surgical antagonism of neuromuscular block, alzheimer’s disease, myasthenia gravis, and
lambert – eaton syndrome where the mechanism of action
was seen as enhancing excitatory synaptic transmission due to
blockade of presynaptic kv channels (for a review, see hayes,
1994). the pharmacologic properties have been studied in
detail. both drugs have multi-compartment pharmacokinetics
with serum half-lives on the order of 1 –3 hr. both drugs are
rapidly absorbed when given orally with peak serum levels
20– 60 min after dosing.  xxxd1804xxx  is highly lipid soluble and
crosses the bbb readily so that it has been used to block k+
channels in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. by
contrast, 3,4-dap is soluble only in aqueous solution, does not
cross the bbb readily, and was therefore used primarily to
block k+ channels in the peripheral nervous system.
the following sections discuss the clinical trials that have
been carried out evaluating  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap in ms patients.
these trials are summarized in table 5.
5.1. pilot safety and efficacy trials of
 xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-diaminopyridine in multiple sclerosis
jones et al. (1983) conducted a placebo-controlled, open
label study of  xxxd1804xxx  in 10 ms patients. improvements were
seen in 5 of 5 patients with visual deficits and 2 of 5 patients
with chronic stable motor and sensory deficits. side effects
included paresthesias and episodes of confusion. this study
suggested that  xxxd1804xxx  was safe and well tolerated and might
produce symptomatic improvement in ms patients and that
further study was warranted.
stefoski et al. (1987) conducted a single-blind, placebocontrolled, crossover design dose titration study of intravenous
 xxxd1804xxx  in 12 men with ms and temperature-sensitive neurological deficits. outcomes were measured by a blinded rater
viewing videotaped neurological examinations. they reported
symptomatic improvements in 10 of 12 patients with improvements in vision in 7 of 9, eye movements in 5 of 6, and motor
improvements in 5 of 9. the only reported side effect was
paresthesias. these results confirmed the initial study using a
blinded evaluation.
in 1990, davis et al. (1990) reported a single-blind,
placebo-controlled trial of short-term oral treatment with 4ap in 20 ms temperature-sensitive male ms patients. they
found improvements in 15 of 15 patients who received active
drug and none of 5 patients who received placebo.
improvements were seen in 11 of 13 with visual impairment
and 9 of 13 with motor impairment. ten patients reported
dizziness or lightheadedness and 5 reported paresthesias.
this study confirmed the previous study using orally
administered drug.

bever et al. (1990) reported an open label dose titration
study of oral 3,4-dap in 10 male ms patients. 3,4-dap had
the theoretical advantage of not crossing the intact bbb,
allowing the possibility that it would selectively enter the brain
in areas of bbb damage associated with ms lesions, reducing
central toxicity. improvements were seen in leg strength and
spasticity on neurological examination and 5 patients had
subjective improvement. all patients reported paresthesias and
dose limiting abdominal pain at higher doses. this study
suggested that although 3,4-dap could improve deficits in
ms, side effects related to peripheral toxicity might be limiting.
in 1991, stefoski et al. (1991) reported a study of orally
administered  xxxd1804xxx  in 17 temperature-sensitive men and
women with ms using a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover design. thirteen of 17 patients had clinically
significant improvements in predefined study deficits on active
drug, whereas only 3 of 9 patients had improvements on
placebo. improvements in motor function occurred in 13, in
vision in 11, and in oculomotor function in 3. side effects were
mild and included dizziness, paresthesias, and nausea. this
study extended earlier work into longer treatment durations and
women with ms.
5.2. randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover design trials of
 xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-diaminopyridine in multiple sclerosis
in 1992, vandiemen et al. (1992) reported a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial of oral
 xxxd1804xxx  in 69 ms patients. significant improvements were seen
during the 12-week period on active treatment in the primary
outcome measure, which was disability as measured by an
accepted measure of disability in ms patients (the kurtzke
expanded disability status score; kurtzke, 1983). improvements were seen in motor and visual function. side effects were
reported by 48 patients and included paresthesias, dizziness,
gait instability, nausea, and abdominal pain. dose reductions
were required in 14 cases and 5 patients withdrew from the
study because of side effects. this study was the first rigorous
trial to show functional improvements in ms patients.
bever et al. (1996) reported a randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind, crossover design trial of orally
administered 3,4-dap in 36 ms patients. improvements were
seen in prospectively defined deficits in 22 patients on 3,4dap and 2 patients on placebo; 17 patients reported subjective
improvement, 14 on 3,4-dap, 2 on placebo, and 1 on both.
thirty of 36 patients reported adverse events, 25 on 3,4-dap
and 5 on placebo. the most common was abdominal pain but 3
patients had episodes of confusion and 1 had a grand mal
seizure. this suggested that 3,4-dap could improve ms
symptoms but that toxicity might be limiting.
5.3. comparison of  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-diaminopyridine
in 1994, polman et al. (1994b) reported a head-to-head
comparison of  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap in 24 patients who had
earlier completed a controlled trial of  xxxd1804xxx  (vandiemen et al.,

1992; polman et al., 1994b). fourteen patients who had not
responded to  xxxd1804xxx  were treated with 3,4-dap and 10 patients
who had responded to  xxxd1804xxx  were enrolled in a 6-week doubleblind randomized crossover comparison of  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap.
none of the  xxxd1804xxx  non-responders improved on 3,4-dap. in the
responder group, only 2 had improvements on 3,4-dap and 3
patients withdrew during 3,4-dap treatment because of side
effects. this suggested that  xxxd1804xxx  produced more clinically
meaningful improvements and did so with lower toxicity than
3,4-dap.
5.4. trials addressing  xxxd1804xxx  formulation issues
two trials examined the relationship of serum levels to side
effects and efficacy. vandiemen et al. (1993) reported that
efficacy was related to total drug exposure whereas toxicity
was related to peak serum levels. this was confirmed by bever
et al. (1994), who completed a serum concentration-controlled
trial of oral  xxxd1804xxx  in 8 ms patients. serum levels measured
every 4 –6 hr showed that outcomes were related to the area
under the serum concentration curve but that toxicities were
related to peak serum levels. in particular, a grand mal seizure
and an episode of confusion occurred in patients at the time of
peak serum levels (with measured serum levels of ¨ 1 am).
these results showing that toxicity was related to peak serum
levels whereas efficacy was related to total drug exposure
suggested that controlled release formulations of  xxxd1804xxx  might
have reduced toxicity.
because of the conclusions reached from the studies of the
relationship of the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1804xxx  to toxicity and
efficacy, a slow release formulation of  xxxd1804xxx  was developed
(elan pharmeceutical research corporation, athlone, ireland).
this formulation was tested in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover design trial (schwid et al., 1997).
ten ms patients were treated for a week with active drug and
for a week with placebo. outcome measures included timed
ambulation, timed stair climbing, quantitative isometric motor
testing, manual motor testing, grip strength, and disability as
scored by the edss and patient subjective responses.
treatment-related improvements were seen in all measures,
which were statistically significant only for timed ambulation.
adverse events were limited to mild nausea, dizziness,
paresthesias, and insomnia. these results supported the idea
that the controlled release formulation retained its efficacy
while reducing toxicity.
5.5. randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, parallel design trials of  xxxd1804xxx 
three definitive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trials have examined the efficacy of  xxxd1804xxx 
in ms. the first trial was a 10-center trial of 161 ms patients
who were treated with escalating doses of a controlled release
formulation of  xxxd1804xxx . no significant treatment-related effect
was seen in the primary outcome measure, edss, due to a
larger than expected placebo response. trends were seen in
manual testing of leg strength and some other secondary

s.i.v. judge, c.t. bever jr. / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 224 – 259

outcome measures. a summary of the results has been
published as background for another study (schwid et al.,
1997) but the results have not been published in full. in 2002,
goodman et al. (2002) reported a 4-center randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of 31 patients
with ms. twenty-five patients received either escalating doses
of  xxxd1804xxx  while 11 patients received placebo. performance on
timed ambulation, manual testing of leg strength, the paced
auditory serial addition test, the 9-hole peg test, and the fatigue
diary were tracked. a significant improvement in timed
ambulation was reported. side effects included dizziness,
insomnia, paresthesias, nausea, asthenia, headache, tremor,
pain, and anxiety. two patients had grand mal seizures. this
trial is the first parallel group study of  xxxd1804xxx  to demonstrate a
significant improvement. recently, goodman et al. (2004)
reported a 10-center, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled parallel group trial of  xxxd1804xxx  in abstract form.
improvements in timed ambulation were found. the only
significant side effect was induction of grand mal seizures.
these recent studies have demonstrated significant treatmentrelated improvements in quantitative measures of ambulation
ability. they show that  xxxd1804xxx  treatment is generally well
tolerated but that seizure induction remains a risk with a narrow
toxic to therapeutic ratio.
5.6. long-term safety and efficacy of
 xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-diaminopyridine
long-term studies of  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap have been
undertaken to examine issues of long-term safety and efficacy.
of particular concern was the possibility that channel blockade
would lead to a compensatory increase in channel synthesis
leading to a loss of therapeutic benefit. polman et al. (1994a)
studied 23 patients treated for 6 –32 months with  xxxd1804xxx . twenty
patients reported continued symptomatic benefit. in general,
side effects were mild but 2 patients had grand mal seizures and
1 patient developed elevations of liver function tests that
improved when treatment was stopped. bever et al. (1995)
enrolled 22 ms patients in a long-term safety study of a
controlled release formulation of  xxxd1804xxx . patients were treated
for 6– 42 months with a total of 52 years of patient exposure.
sixteen patients reported sustained benefit. one grand mal
seizure occurred after 24 months of treatment. these studies
suggest that the symptomatic benefits of  xxxd1804xxx  treatment can be
sustained but demonstrate that there is a risk of seizures even in
patients who have received sustained treatment without
previous adverse events or evidence of toxicity.
5.7. negative studies on cognitive
impairment and fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients
because of anecdotal reports of improvements in fatigue,
memory, and concentration in ms patients treated with  xxxd1804xxx 
and 3,4-dap, these issues have been examined in clinical trials.
in 1994, smits et al. (1994) reported a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial examining the
cognitive effects of  xxxd1804xxx  treatment. no statistically significant

249

changes were found in a range of measures. bever et al. (1996)
examined cognitive function using the brief repeatable
battery of neuropsychological tests for ms (rao et al.,
1991) in 36 patients in a trial of 3,4-dap. no significant
treatment-related differences were found. rossini et al. (2001)
examined the effects of oral  xxxd1804xxx  on cognitive performance
using a large battery of tests in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled crossover design trial in 60 ms patients. no
significant treatment-related changes were found. these studies
do not support the use of  xxxd1804xxx  or 3,4-dap for cognitive
impairment in ms patients.
two studies have examined the effect of 3,4-dap and  xxxd1804xxx 
on fatigue in ms patients. in 1998, sheean et al. (1998)
reported an open label study of 3,4-dap in 8 ms patients with
fatigue. the fatigue severity score (krupp et al., 1989), a
patient self-report, was used with electrophysiological measures of motor fatigue (central activation, physiological fatigue
index, and twitch force) to capture both subjective and
objective fatigue. seven patients had subjective improvement
and statistically significant improvements in the electrophysiological measures. rossini et al. (2001) examined fatigue as
part of the trial of  xxxd1804xxx  on cognitive impairment, as mentioned
above. no treatment-related effect was seen on the fatigue
severity scale ratings although a subgroup analysis showed an
improvement in patients with serum  xxxd1804xxx  levels over 30 ng/
ml. these studies suggest that  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap may
improve fatigue in some patients. in view of the other
treatments available for ms fatigue, they leave open the
question of whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the
risks.
6. conclusions
demyelination in ms leads to a reorganization of axolemmal
channels that causes conduction abnormalities including conduction failure. pharmacologic agents that block kv channels
have been found to improve conduction in experimentally
induced demyelination and produce symptomatic improvement
in some ms patients. toxicity, particularly epileptogenesis, has
limited the use of the 2 available agents,  xxxd1804xxx  and 3,4-dap in
ms patients. ongoing research is further defining the molecular
pharmacology of both the improvements seen in patients and
epileptogenesis and other toxicities. if other kv channel blockers
can be identified, which are selective for the channels involved
in the symptomatic benefits seen in ms patients, these may be
useful symptomatic treatments for many ms patients. at
present, new insights into the dynamic processing capabilities
of a single axon are now expanding the traditional view of axons
beyond that of simple cables enabling the transmission of
propagated action potentials from soma to synaptic terminals
(for well-integrated review, see debanne, 2004). emerging
dynamic views of axons coupled with the diversity of
differentially localized kv channels expressed on neurons and
immune system cells active in ms brain (also expressed in other
tissues) indicates that, in addition to further identification/
development of highly potent and selective kv blocking agents,
new methods of drug delivery (i.e., nanotechnology/nanomedi-

250

s.i.v. judge, c.t. bever jr. / pharmacology & therapeutics 111 (2006) 224 – 259

cine delivery systems) may be required for better targeting welldefined tissues/sites before the precise kv channel modulation
envisioned can be realized.
