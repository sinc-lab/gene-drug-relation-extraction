 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors— xxxd2186xxx  (iressa)
carlos l. arteaga, md,* and david h. johnson, md†

several epithelial tumors display  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr) overexpression (with or without egfr gene
amplification) that is often associated with increased
production of egfr ligands. this permits the activation of
endogenous tumor egfr via autocrine mechanisms, resulting
in cellular proliferation and tumor growth. interruption of
receptor signaling with bivalent egfr antibodies or with small
molecule inhibitors of the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  results in
inhibition of tumor cell proliferation or viability in vitro and in
vivo. one small molecule currently undergoing preclinical and
clinical investigation is  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa), a synthetic
anilinoquinazoline capable of inhibiting egfr  xxxg2198xxx 
in vitro. the early results of clinical trials indicate this drug
possesses antitumor activity in certain malignancies of the
upper aerodigestive tract. curr opin oncol 2001, 13:491–498 © 2001

most cellular proto-oncogenes encode proteins that participate in signaling pathways by which cells receive and
execute instructions that lead to mitogenesis, differentiation, lineage determination, cell migration, extracellular matrix production, and apoptosis, among others.
these proto-oncogene protein products include  xxxg1608xxx  tyrosine kinases and receptor substrates, serine or threonine kinases, receptor adaptor molecules, low molecular weight gtpases, and transcription
factors which, when overexpressed or mutationally activated, can lead to cell transformation and tumor progression. the large number of oncogenic protein tyrosine
kinases plus the rare presence of  xxxd1075xxx  in
nontransformed cells argue persuasively that tyrosine
phosphorylation and activation of signaling molecules
downstream receptor tyrosine kinases are critical events
in growth control and transformation [1•].
the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr,  xxxg682xxx ,
 xxxg682xxx -1) was the first discovered member of the
her/ xxxg682xxx  family of  xxxg1608xxx  tyrosine kinases, which also includes her2/neu ( xxxg682xxx -2) and the
heregulin or neuregulin receptors  xxxg722xxx  ( xxxg722xxx ) and
 xxxg723xxx  ( xxxg682xxx -4). the ectodomain of each egfr,  xxxg722xxx ,
and  xxxg723xxx  interacts with a specific set of soluble ligands,
whereas no ligand has been identified thus far for the
orphan her2 receptor [2,3]. ligand binding to the
ectodomain of egfr,  xxxg722xxx , and  xxxg723xxx  results in the
formation of homo- and heterodimeric complexes, activation of the intracellular  xxxg2198xxx  activity, and
receptor autophosphorylation in specific c-terminal tyrosines which, in turn, recruit sh2-containing adaptors or
second messengers that mediate the effects of the receptors on cell proliferation, development, differentiation,
migration, and oncogenesis.
several epithelial tumors, particularly carcinomas of
the upper aerodigestive tract including non–small cell
lung cancer (nsclc), display egfr overexpression
with or without egfr gene amplification often associated with increased production of egfr ligands [4,5].
this allows for activation of endogenous tumor egfr
via autocrine mechanisms. in support of the operational
nature of these autocrine pathways in egfr-expressing tumor cells, interruption of receptor signaling with
bivalent egfr antibodies or with small molecule inhibitors of the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  results in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation or viability in vitro and
in vivo [6•]. these observations plus (1) the ability to
identify egfr-overexpressing human tumors before

anticancer therapy, (2) the association of egfr overexpression with poor patient prognosis, and (3) the lack of
an obvious physiologic role of the egfr in the adult all
suggest egfr as a rational molecular target for antitumor strategies.

clinical approaches for blocking
egfr function
one antireceptor approach has been based on the premise that egfr with mutations in the  xxxd83xxx  (atp)-binding site lack  xxxg2198xxx  function
and do not display a full range of ligand-induced biochemical responses [2,3], implying that the receptor’s
 xxxg2198xxx  is essential for transformation. therefore,
in an attempt to generate antireceptor compounds, small
molecules that compete for the mg-atp binding site of
the catalytic domain of the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  have
been identified by random screening of natural or synthetic compound libraries for specific egfr kinase inhibitory activity [7•]. the concentrations of these compounds that inhibit the egfr kinase in vitro are in the
nanomolar (nmol/l) or sub-nmr range, whereas, in general, the concentrations required to inhibit the >80% homologous her2/neu ( xxxg682xxx -2) kinase are a few logarithms
higher, supporting their overall egfr-specificity [8]. it
should be noted that because of the high intracellular
concentrations of atp, higher concentrations of these
inhibitors than those required to block the egfr kinase
in vitro may be required to block egfr signal transduction for prolonged periods in intact cells. the low molecular weight of these inhibitors may allow them to penetrate tumor sites better. they can be administered
orally, which makes them highly suitable for chronic
therapy. whether  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors work preferentially on egfr that are activated by autocrine or paracrine receptor ligands, regardless of egfr levels, and
whether receptor detectability in diagnostic tumor tissue
should be required for enrollment of patients in clinical
trials with antireceptor drugs are also questions worthy of
further research.

 xxxd2186xxx  (iressa)
one of these small molecules competing for the mgatp binding site is  xxxd2186xxx  [9••] (fig. 1), a synthetic
anilinoquinazoline that inhibits the isolated egfr kinase in vitro with an ic50 of 0.023 nm but greater than
100 times higher concentrations required to block other
kinases such as her2,  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg800xxx , or serine threonine
kinases such as pkc, mek-1, and mek-2.  xxxd2186xxx  has
been shown to block both egf-stimulated receptor
phosphorylation and growth in kb human squamous
cancer cells [10] (fig. 2). in addition, it can inhibit
egfr autophosphorylation and basal growth of tumor
cells as well as xenografts with different receptor levels
[11,12•], implying that high egfr expression is not re-

quired to predict for an antitumor effect of  xxxd2186xxx . the
compound has a small nonpolar meta substitute on the
aniline ring and is competitive with atp and noncompetitive with substrate. the substrate protein-binding
site theoretically is the more attractive intracellular target
on these enzymes, possessing lower homology than the
atp site between different receptor kinases. however,
the 4-anilinoquinazolines are potent and selective inhibitors, despite binding at the atp site. the tight structure-activity relationships shown by these compounds
suggests a clearly defined binding mode, where the
quinazoline ring binds in the adenine pocket and the
anilino ring binds in an adjacent, unique lipophilic
pocket [9••].

mechanisms of antitumor action
the engagement of her/ xxxg682xxx  receptors, including the
egfr, results in the activation of a large network of
independent signaling pathways that subvert cell cycle
checkpoints and proapoptotic molecules, thus leading to
dysregulated cell cycle progression and enhanced tumor
cell survival. several reports indicate transformed cells
that naturally overexpress egfr can subvert the g1 to
s transition by modulating the levels of  xxxg366xxx  and
the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor  xxxg419xxx 
through both mapk and pi3k/akt signaling pathways
[3]. thus, not surprisingly, egfr kinase inhibition with
 xxxd2186xxx  upregulates levels of the cdk inhibitor p27,
leading to inhibition of  xxxg410xxx  activity and arrest in the g1
phase of the cell cycle [13]. in a recent study using the
anti-egfr quinazoline ag1478, phosphorothioate p27
oligonucleotides decreased p27 and abrogated ag1478induced cell cycle arrest in a431 cells [14]. these results
imply that upregulation of p27 and, possibly, restoration
of rb function are required for the antitumor action of
egfr kinase inhibitors. thus, tumors with loss or low
levels of p27,  xxxg366xxx  gene amplification, or mutational
inactivations of rb may not respond to anti-egfr therapies compared with tumors with intact rb and normal
levels of  xxxg366xxx  and p27. this hypothesis requires
future investigation.

figure 2. mechanism of action
 xxxd2186xxx  inhibits autophosphorylation of the tyrosine
kinase thereby inhibiting the ras/raf/map kinase pathways,
resulting in inhibition of cellular proliferation, angiogenesis
and tumor invasion, and metastasis. it appears to increase
apoptosis as well.

despite its high in vitro ic50 against her2, sub-µm
concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  can inhibit her2 phosphorylation as well as growth of her2-overexpressing human breast tumor cells with moderate levels of egfr
[15]. this suggests an additional mechanism of action as
well as the possibility that, in a cohort of breast cancers,
her2 is transactivated via ligand-activated egfr also
present in tumor cells. the ag1478 quinazoline suppressed mammary tumors in mmtv/neu + tgf-␣ bigenic mice [16•], further suggesting that egfr kinase
inhibitors can inhibit tumor cell systems in which egfr
and her2/neu cooperate. furthermore, a similar antiegfr quinazoline ag1517 induced the formation of
inactive egfr/her2 heterodimers in skbr-3 cells,
preventing the ability of these her2-overexpressing
cells to respond to the  xxxg722xxx /4 ligand heregulin [17].
whether other small molecule egfr kinase inhibitors
can also subtract her2 from partnering with its her
co-receptors and block its function in this ‘dominant
negative’ fashion requires further research.
finally,  xxxd2186xxx  inhibits immunohistochemical levels of
vegf and microvessel density in several egfrexpressing xenografts [18•]. this result is consistent
with the known dependence of the vegf promoter on
egfr signals and a previous report of downregulation of
vegf production by tumor cells in vitro and in vivo by
both egfr and her2/neu antibodies [19]. these data
suggest inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis as an additional cellular mechanism to explain the antitumor effect
of egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors.

preclinical studies
ciardiello et al. [20••] tested the antiproliferative activity
of  xxxd2186xxx  as a single agent and in combination with
cytotoxic drugs in four human cancer cell lines that express egfr and tumor growth factor alpha (tgf-␣).
cell lines used in these experiments included geo colon cancer cells, zr-75–1 and mcf-10a breast cancer

cells, and ovcar-3 ovarian cancer cells. the cytotoxic
agents used in these experiments (cisplatin, carboplatin,
oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide,
 xxxd3401xxx , and raltiterxed) possessed differing mechanisms of action. as a single agent,  xxxd2186xxx  induced a
dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation in soft
agar with an ic50 ranging between 0.2 and 0.4 µm in all
cell lines tested. the antiproliferative effects seen in
these cell lines was accompanied by a dose-dependent
increase in apoptosis. in nude mice bearing geo colon
cancer xenografts, a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth also was observed with single agent  xxxd2186xxx 
(fig. 3). this effect was cytostatic rather than cytotoxic
as tumor growth resumed at a rate comparable to control animals on withdrawal of drug (albeit only after 1 to
2 weeks). growth inhibition was essentially complete at
a dose of 5 mg/day. despite the cytostatic nature of tumor growth inhibition, the animals treated with  xxxd2186xxx 
experienced improved survival (fig. 3).
for the combination therapy experiments, a fixed dose
of  xxxd2186xxx  was selected (2.5 mg/dose). this dose induced an ∼50% inhibition of tumor growth after 4 weeks
of treatment and was well tolerated. nude mice bearing
ceo xenografts were treated with  xxxd2186xxx  plus 4 weeks
of the maximally tolerated doses of paclitaxel,  xxxd3401xxx ,
or raltiterxed. all three regimens resulted in substantial
tumor growth inhibition; they were well tolerated and
not associated with unexpected or excessive toxicities.
however, the ceo tumors resumed their former growth
rates shortly after treatment was discontinued. the delayed tumor growth observed in the treated animals was
associated with improved survival compared with the
control animals and those treated with the cytotoxic
drugs alone. the survival benefit was most pronounced
in the animals treated with paclitaxel and  xxxd2186xxx .
these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
chemotherapy-induced cellular damage can convert
egfr ligands from growth factors into survival factors

regression of the a549 tumor and in some cases rendered
animals tumor free. combination with gemcitabine was
neither additive nor antagonistic in the a549 tumor
model.
from aforementioned data, it appears that  xxxd2186xxx  enhances the antitumor activity of a variety of cytotoxic
agents with diverse mechanisms of action. these effects
were most pronounced with the taxanes but were also
observed with the  xxxd2923xxx , doxorubicin,
and the folate antagonist edetrexate. combination with
gemcitabine was neither beneficial nor antagonistic,
whereas the combination of  xxxd2186xxx  and vinorelbine
proved difficult for the mice to tolerate. the ability of
this small molecule to enhance the cytotoxic effects of
such a diverse array of drugs is similar to that observed
with monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of egfr [23,24]. somewhat surprisingly
perhaps, the ability of  xxxd2186xxx  to enhance the cytotoxicity of these varied drugs was not dependent of the
expression of egfr. the mechanism(s) of this enhanced cytotoxic effect is not well characterized.

[21]. under these circumstances, egfr blockade
coupled with cytotoxic therapy could induce programmed cell death [21].
sirotnak et al. [12•] also performed combination studies
with  xxxd2186xxx  and cytotoxic agents.  xxxd2186xxx  (5 times
daily × 2) was administered orally with various cytotoxic
agents (i.p. every 3–4 days × 4) to mice with wellestablished tumors of various cell types. cytotoxic agents
included cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel,
docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and edatrexate. interestingly, single agent  xxxd2186xxx  induced tumor regression with both high and low egfr expression in contrast to observations published previously by lei et al.
[22] using both a nonspecific and a specific inhibitor of
the egfr  xxxg2198xxx . however, the greatest level
of tumor growth inhibition occurred in those cells with
the highest egfr expression. potentiation of cytotoxicity was observed with most of the cytotoxic drugs tested.
against the a549 adenocarcinoma cell line, for example,
the growth inhibitory effects of cisplatin and carboplatin
were increased fourfold, whereas the combination of paclitaxel or docetaxel and  xxxd2186xxx  resulted in pronounced

in rats and dogs, the bioavailability of  xxxd2186xxx  is ∼50%
when drug is extensively distributed throughout most
tissues [13]. two randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group studies of pharmacokinetics
and tolerability were performed in healthy human volunteers [25•]. in these subjects, peak plasma levels of
 xxxd2186xxx  were observed at 3 to 7 hours following a single
oral dose (fig. 4). cmax and area under the concentrationtime curve (auc) were dose-proportional from 10 to
100 mg. the terminal elimination half-life (t1⁄2␤) was
28 hours (range 12–51 hours). a nonblind, randomized,
two-period crossover study to assess the effect of food on
bioavailability revealed cmax was reduced by 34% and
auc by 14%. however, t1⁄2␤ was not affected. urinary

recovery of  xxxd2186xxx  was miniscule (<0.5%), indicating
that this was not a major route of elimination. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2186xxx  during administration of multiple doses could be predicted from day 1 values. no
serious adverse events or withdrawals occurred, and the
frequency of adverse events was similar that with placebo. similarly, in patients with advanced malignancies,
cmax also was achieved within 3 and 7 hours of oral dosing and the terminal half-life ranged between 24 and 85
hours [26]. importantly, plasma concentrations of
 xxxd2186xxx  were maintained above the ic50 for in vitro
growth inhibition for more than 24 hours following oral
doses of >100 mg.

grades of diarrhea. myelosuppression was not common.
the mean cmax ranged from 113 to 2255 ng/ml, whereas
the mean auc0–24 ranged from 1,823 to 38,493 ng/h/ml.
the terminal half-life of  xxxd2186xxx  was 46 hours, with
steady state levels achieved within 7 to 10 days in most
patients. at drug doses ⱖ100 mg/d, the plasma concentration of  xxxd2186xxx  exceeded the ic90 for in vitro growth
inhibition for more than 24 hours. stable disease for
longer than 4 months was observed in 14 patients. of
note, 4 of 16 patients with advanced nsclc achieved a
partial remission or major tumor regression for an overall
response rate of 25% in this tumor type. all 16 patients
had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

phase i studies

to date, two phase i trials have been completed in patients with advanced malignancies. kris et al. [27] administered single agent  xxxd2186xxx  to patients with solid tumors known to express egfr, although measurement of
egfr expression was not specifically required. eligible
participants were given a single oral dose of  xxxd2186xxx 
starting at 50 mg/day and observed for 6 days during
which time protein kinase (pk) measurements were obtained. drug was then administered for 14 consecutive
days every 28 days. the dose was gradually escalated
until dose-limiting toxicity developed or significant corneal damage was observed or a maximum of 925 mg/d
was delivered. a total of 64 patients were treated. enrollees had a median age of 54 years and a wide variety of
solid tumors, including non—small-cell lung cancer,
ovarian cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancers, and
prostate cancer. the dose-limiting toxicity proved to be
grade 3 diarrhea at 700 mg/d. additional adverse events
included a characteristic acneiform rash commonly infigure 5. characteristic rash observed with  xxxd2186xxx 

japanese investigators also conducted a phase i trial of
single agent  xxxd2186xxx  in patients with solid tumors [28].
as in the aforementioned trial, the enrollees were not
specifically screened for egfr expression, although all
the entrants had tumors likely to express egfr (eg,
nsclc, colon cancer). participants were given a single
oral dose of  xxxd2186xxx  starting at 50 mg/d. for the first
three cohorts of patients, a single dose of  xxxd2186xxx  was
administered, after which patients were observed for 7 to
10 days for pk determinations. thereafter, patients were
given the same dose for 14 days followed by a 14-day
rest. a total of 31 patients were treated, 23 of whom
had nsclc. identical to the first phase i study, the
dose-limiting toxicity proved to be grade 3 diarrhea at
700 mg/d. additional adverse events were remarkably
modest and consisted of grade 1–2 rash, anorexia, and
nausea. significant myelosuppression was not observed.
 xxxd2186xxx  exhibited a dose-related increase in cmax
(range: 74–1251 ng/ml) and auc0–24 (range: 1236–23,356

23 heavily pretreated patients with nsclc, 5 (21.7%)
achieved a partial remission even though some had received as many as four prior treatment regimens (fig. 6).
sixteen of the patients with nsclc had received prior
platinum-based therapy and responses persisted for up to
11 months.

25% among the 24 evaluable patients. one patient subsequently developed a complete remission lasting 8+
months, whereas the remaining partial remissions have
persisted for 1–12.4 months. these data indicate a clinically insignificant increase in the systemic exposure of
 xxxd2186xxx  when given concurrently with carboplatin and
paclitaxel, without an apparent increase in drug-related
toxicities.

phase ii study in nsclc

recently, a phase ii trial was completed in which
 xxxd2186xxx  was combined with carboplatin plus paclitaxel
for patients with advanced nsclc [29]. participants
were randomized to one of two schedules of  xxxd2186xxx 
administration—days 1 to 14 with carboplatin and paclitaxel administered on days 8 and 36 or with chemotherapy administered on days 1 and 29 and  xxxd2186xxx  delivered on days 22 through 35. in addition,  xxxd2186xxx  was
administered at two dose levels—250 and 500 mg/d.
among the 25 enrollees, just one dose-limiting toxicity
was observed which (a grade 3 rash) occurred at the
higher dose of  xxxd2186xxx . a summary of toxicities is provided in table 1. mean exposure to  xxxd2186xxx  increased
by ∼50% and 25% for the 250 mg and 500 mg dose levels
of  xxxd2186xxx . however, no change occurred in exposure to
carboplatin and paclitaxel with  xxxd2186xxx  administered
concurrently. at day 56, the overall response rate was

100 mg/kg, the drug completely prevents egf-induced
autophosphorylation of egfr in human hn5 tumors
growing as xenografts in athymic mice and of the hepatic
egfr of the treated mice. osi-774 can inhibit the proliferation of difi human colon tumor cells at submicromolar concentrations in cell culture and induces cell
cycle arrest at the g1 phase. this inhibitor produces a
marked accumulation of retinoblastoma protein in its underphosphorylated form and accumulation of  xxxg419xxx  in
difi cells. inhibition of the egfr also triggers apoptosis in these cells as determined by formation of dna
fragments and other criteria. perez-soler et al. [31] recently completed a phase ii trial of single agent osi-774
in patients with advanced nsclc. eligible patients
were required to have ⱖ10% tumor cells expressing
egfr and tumor progression following platinum-based
chemotherapy. a total of 56 patients were treated, 7 of
whom achieved a partial response. although extremely
preliminary, these data support the clinical findings observed in phase i trials with  xxxd2186xxx  because these drugs
function in a comparable manner [32,33].
phase iii studies in nsclc

two large phase iii trials completed enrollment earlier
this year. the study design was identical in both studies
in that patients were randomized to one of three treatment arms: chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus
 xxxd2186xxx  at one of two dose levels (250 or 500 mg/d,
continuously). the chemotherapy regimens were carboplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus gemcitabine. the
primary endpoint for both trials is overall survival. of
note, second- and third-line trials of single agent  xxxd2186xxx 
have been recently completed as well. the results of
these two trials are also eagerly awaited as objective responses have been observed even in heavily pretreated
patients as reported in the phase i experiences from both
the united states and japan [27,28,34].

conclusions
in summary, recent preclinical and clinical data indicate
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tki) may have a profound
impact on the treatment of many malignancies, including
hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. tki that target egfr are of particular interest given the frequency
of egfr expression in common tumors such as
nsclc, renal carcinomas, pancreatic cancers, and others. it is expected that, with the enormous laboratory and
clinical activity in this area, some critical relevant questions will be resolved. these include (1) other mechanisms of action of egfr inhibitors; (2) potential molecular mechanisms of tumor cell resistance; (3) the
predictors of clinical response to these therapies; (4) the
optimal timing and duration of anti-egfr treatments
and their role in halting the progression of preneoplastic
lesions; (5) the surrogate markers of egfr inactivation
in situ that will modulate clinical experiments; (6) the
better (or safer) combinations with standard chemo-

therapy or other molecule-targeted, cancer-specific
drugs; and, most importantly (7) the possible side effects
from prolonged inactivation of the egfr in adult patients with chronic cancer.
