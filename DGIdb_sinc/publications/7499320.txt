the molecular site and mechanism of action of inhaled volatile anesthetics is not known despite intensive studies of over
30 years. various hypothesis have been developed ranging from
lipids to proteins as molecular targets and unspecific to specific
sites of action (for review, see miller (1985), koblin (1990), and
franks and lieb (1994)). in recent years the focus has shifted
to membrane proteins, including ion channels and receptors for
which different anesthetic effects have been reported, however,
neither a specific nor an unifying mechanism of action has been
described. we have previously identified another intrinsic
membrane protein, the plasma membrane ca21 pump, as a
potential target for anesthetic action (kosk-kosicka and roszczynska, 1993; kosk-kosicka, 1994). its ca21-atpase activity
and ca21 transport are inhibited by a variety of inhaled anesthetics, both clinically used and experimental ones (kosk-

kosicka and roszczynska, 1993; franks et al., 1995).1 we have
described the effects of four halogenated volatile anesthetics
that are used in clinical anesthesia on the normal process of
enzyme activation by either calmodulin binding or dimerization (kosk-kosicka and roszczynska, 1993). all four drugs
inhibited these two activation pathways in a dose-dependent
manner and with a similar  xxxd1289xxx . the inhibition was observed at
their clinical concentrations suggesting that ca21-atpase was
not only a good model target of an intrinsic membrane protein
but could also be a pharmacological in vivo target for this group
of general anesthetics. in subsequent studies we have demonstrated that the inhibition was selective as judged by the following criteria. first, two other groups of general anesthetics,
barbiturates and alkanols, did not inhibit the enzyme at their
anesthetic concentrations (kosk-kosicka et al., 1992).1 second,
several other atpases including mg21-atpase and na1,k1atpase showed significantly lower sensitivity to the volatile
anesthetics than did the ca21-atpase.2 third, the above phenomena were observed in three distinct plasma membranes,
ranging from erythrocytes to neuronal and endothelial cell
types (kosk-kosicka et al., 1995b). as the site and mechanism
of anesthetic action have not been explained and only a few
proteins among the several reported to be targeted by anesthetics in vitro are affected at clinically relevant concentrations
the observed inhibition of the ca21-atpase activity deserves a
close attention.
in the present study we have investigated the mechanism of
enzyme inhibition by volatile anesthetics by two experimental
approaches: ca21-atpase activity assay and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. we have used dimeric ca21-atpase
whose activation is independent of a modulatory protein calmodulin since we have previously established that both normal
modes of enzyme activation (by calmodulin binding to enzyme
monomers and by the self-association of monomers to dimers)
are equally sensitive to this group of general anesthetics (koskkosicka and roszczynska, 1993; kosk-kosicka and bzdega,
1988; kosk-kosicka et al., 1990). we have assessed the effects
of the anesthetics on the ca21-dependent conformational
changes of the enzyme by monitoring the ca21-dependent
changes in fluorescence intensity of two probes: 1) intrinsic
tryptophan(s) that reflect a conformational change which the
ca21-atpase undergoes upon binding the substrate ca21 in
the initial step of enzymatic cycle, and 2) an external probe,
fluorescein 59-isothiocyanate (fitc)3 attached to lysine 601 in
the active site that normally binds atp (dupont, 1976; inesi et
al., 1980; kosk-kosicka and inesi, 1985; kosk-kosicka et al.,
1989). we demonstrate that the anesthetics inhibit both measures in a dose-dependent manner and there is a good correla1

volatile anesthetics at concentrations that are used in
clinical practice to induce anesthesia selectively inhibit
activity of the plasma membrane ca21-transport atpase
(kosk-kosicka, d., and roszczynska, g. (1993) anesthesiology 79, 774 –780). we have investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory action of several anesthetics on
the purified erythrocyte ca21-atpase by employing fluorescence spectroscopy measurements that report
changes in the environment of intrinsic tryptophans
and of an extrinsic probe attached in the active site of
the enzyme. we have shown that the observed inhibition
of the ca21-dependent activation of the enzyme correlates well with the elimination of the ca21-induced conformational change that is important for the proper
function of the enzyme. analysis of the anesthetics effects on the total tryptophan fluorescence indicates a
significant effect on enzyme conformation. similar
changes have been observed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca21-atpase. we propose that volatile anesthetics
inhibit ca21-atpase by interacting with nonpolar sites
in protein interior, in analogy to the binding demonstrated for myoglobin, hemoglobin, and adenylate kinase (schoenborn, b. p., and featherstone, r. m. (1967)
adv. pharmacol. 5, 1–17; tilton, r. f., kuntz, i. d., and
petsko, g. a. (1984) biochemistry 23, 2849 –2857). such
binding is expected to modify conformational substate(s) of the enzyme and perturb its function. we view
this process as an example of a general phenomena of
interaction of small molecules with internal sites in
proteins.

ca21-atpases and volatile anesthetics

materials and methods

egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (p5763) and cnbr-activated sepharose 4b were purchased from sigma; octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecylether (c12e8) was obtained from nikko (tokyo, japan). coupling of
bovine calmodulin to sepharose was performed in accordance with
pharmacia biotech inc. instructions as described earlier (kosk-kosicka
and bzdega, 1988).  xxxd1993xxx  and isoflurane were obtained from
anaquest (liberty corner, nj);  xxxd2604xxx  was from abbott hospital products; and thymol-free halothane from halocarbon laboratories (river edge, nj). halothane is a two-carbon alkane halogenated
derivative, the other three anesthetics belong to halogenated methyl
 xxxd2052xxx  derivatives as shown in fig. 1.
the methods used for preparation of erythrocyte ghost membranes
and sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr), purification of the ca21-atpase from
erythrocyte membranes, determination of protein, and ca21 concentration were as described previously (kosk-kosicka et al., 1983, 1986;
kosk-kosicka and bzdega, 1988). free ca21 concentrations were calculated (fabiato and fabiato, 1979) from total calcium and egta concentrations, based on the constants given by schwartzenbach et al.
(1957). total calcium was measured by atomic absorption. sarcoplasmic
reticulum was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle in the laboratory of
dr. inesi (eletr and inesi, 1972).
the ca21-atpase activity—this was determined by colorimetric
measurement of inorganic phosphate production, generally as described
previously (kosk-kosicka and bzdega, 1988; kosk-kosicka et al., 1983).
the assay was performed in sealed (to maintain constant concentration
of the anesthetic) 0.65-ml polypropylene tubes in a total reaction volume of 0.33 ml. after addition of all reagents and protein, volatile
anesthetic was delivered to the tube in an air-tight hamilton syringe
and the reaction was started with 3 mm atp. after vortexing, samples
were placed in a water bath at either 37 or 25 °c for 30 min. the
reaction was terminated with ammonium molybdate/metavanadate at
individual times. the aliquots of volatile anesthetics delivered to the
assay were taken from solutions of saturated volatile anesthetics in
reaction mixture, which were prepared daily from the stock of pure

the purified dimeric ca21-transport atpase was assayed at 70 nm
enzyme concentration in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm tris
maleate, ph 7.4, 120 mm kcl, 8 mm mgcl2, 3 mm atp, 1 mm egta, and
cacl2 in concentrations yielding the required free ca21. the concentration of c12e8 was kept constant at 150 mm. for activity assay of the
ca21-transport atpase in membranes, c12e8 was omitted. the activity
was calculated as a difference between the activity determined in the
above reaction mixture and the reaction mixture in which ca21 was
omitted. 65 mg of ghost membranes and 1.2 mg of sarcoplasmic reticulum were used per tube. in addition, the reaction mixture for sarcoplasmic reticulum contained the divalent cation ionophore a23187
(10 mm).
fluorescence measurements—fluorescence intensity was measured
at equilibrium using a fluoromax spectrofluorometer with dm3000f
software. tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 290 nm and the
emission was recorded at 330 nm. excitation and emission wavelengths
used for fitc ca21-atpase were 484 and 515 nm. the ca21-atpase in
erythrocyte ghosts was labeled with fitc as described previously
(kosk-kosicka and bzdega, 1990). the labeled enzyme was then purified by our standard procedure. the stoichiometry of labeling was 1 mol
of fitc/1 mol of enzyme. fluorescence measurements were done in the
medium containing 100 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 150 mm c12e8, 130 mm
kcl, 8 mm mgcl2, and 1 mm egta at 25 °c in the total volume of 1.1 ml
in a sealed cuvette. protein concentration was 10 mg/ml for the purified
plasma membrane ca21-atpase (70 nm) and sr. for measurements of
the calcium-dependent change in fluorescence cacl2 was added after
the anesthetic and the calcium-induced decrease of fitc fluorescence
was related to the total initial fluorescence at each anesthetic concentration (fi). because total tryptophan fluorescence decreased with time
we have differentiated between fio (at time 0) and fi (measured right
before the addition of cacl2). free ca21 was 17.5 mm. the solution was
gently stirred during the experiment which lasted 4 –5 min. stirring did
not cause any perturbation of the fluorescence signal. corrections for
the dilution effect were made when necessary.
decays of fluorescence intensity—the frequency domain data were
analyzed by the method of nonlinear least squares (gratton et al.,
1984; lakowicz et al., 1984). the measured values were compared
with values predicted from a model. for a multiexponential decay, i(t)

tion between the attenuation of the ca21-dependent conformational changes and the inhibition of the ca21-atpase activity.
in addition, the observed changes in the total tryptophan fluorescence also suggest that the anesthetics affect enzyme conformation. we analyze these findings with respect to the demonstrated binding of small ligands such as xenon (a very potent
experimental inhaled anesthetic) in interior spaces of metmyoglobin which affects the internal motions and substates of the
protein (schoenborn and featherstone, 1967; tilton et al.,
1984). as proteins undergo motions small molecules enter and
interact with nonpolar sites in the protein interior (englander
et al., 1972; lakowicz and weber, 1973; eftink and ghiron,
1976; cooper, 1976; cohen et al., 1977; lim and sauer, 1991;
eriksson et al., 1992; lim et al., 1994). we postulate that
interaction of anesthetic molecules with nonpolar sites in the
ca21-atpase molecule modifies conformational substate(s) of
the protein which results in impairment of its enzymatic function. we consider binding of small molecules in nonpolar internal protein spaces a general phenomena whose occurrence,
however, requires compatibility between the nonpolar sites
available in the protein and the invading molecule. in the case
of gaseous anesthetic such an interaction may or may not have
functional consequences at clinical anesthetic concentrations
depending on the structure (flexibility) and function of a given
protein, as it does for the ca21-atpases but apparently not for
myoglobin or hemoglobin. the lack of a significant functional
effect of the demonstrated anesthetic binding in myoglobin or
hemoglobin and their relationship to anesthesia apparently
eliminated it from consideration as a mechanism of anesthetic
action. in contrast, both function and conformation of the ca21atpase are significantly disturbed by the anesthetics and their
action on this intrinsic membrane protein which controls intracellular ca21 homeostasis could certainly contribute to the
pharmacological anesthetic effects. our model needs to be
treated as hypothetical until future advances in nmr or x-ray
crystallography allow for its verification.

determination of concentrations of anesthetics—in parallel to the
activity or fluorescence assay, samples were incubated under identical
conditions and used for determination of the effective anesthetic concentrations during the assay. halothane, isoflurane, and  xxxd1993xxx 
were extracted with heptane ( xxxd2604xxx  with octane), measured
by gas chromatography, and the concentrations were calculated as
described earlier (kosk-kosicka and roszczynska, 1993). 1 mac equals

in 50% of those subjects exposed to a noxious stimulus as defined by
eger (1978).
data are expressed as the mean 6 s.e. of three to six independent
experiments performed in duplicates. the data points were fitted by the
nonlinear regression method.
results

we have demonstrated a strong correlation between the general anesthetic potency (as expressed in mac values) of several
halogenated volatile anesthetics and their ability to inhibit the
ca21-atpase activity (kosk-kosicka and roszczynska, 1993).
the anesthetic concentrations in our activity assays were expressed in volume % at 37 °c for easy comparison with their
anesthetic potency. at present we have recalculated the values
into millimolar concentrations (in addition, original data for
 xxxd2604xxx  have been included) and compared the concentrations of the anesthetics in the reaction mixture that halfmaximally inhibit the purified erythrocyte ca21-atpase with
their concentrations in blood to which the enzyme may be
exposed when 1 mac of a given anesthetic is administered in
clinical anesthesia. fig. 2 shows that the concentrations of all
four agents that the enzyme may encounter during anesthesia
inhibit enzyme function.
the anesthetics decrease both vmax and ca21 affinity of the
ca21-atpase activity (fig. 3). as shown in fig. 3 isoflurane at
a concentration that half-maximally inhibits the enzyme
causes a small yet statistically significant shift in the apparent
k1⁄2 for calcium from pca 7.05 6 0.05 to 6.9 6 0.04. similar

activity was assayed as described under “materials and methods.” the
reaction mixture contained 50 mm tris maleate, ph 7.4, 120 mm kcl, 8
mm mgcl2, 150 mm c12e8, 1 mm egta, and 3 mm atp. various amounts
of cacl2 were added to obtain the calcium concentrations specified in
the horizontal axis. enzyme concentration was 70 nm. the assays were
performed at 37 °c. inset shows normalized data of one typical experiment, where 100% is the maximal activity either with or without
isoflurane. six independent experiments were performed in duplicates.
the mean k1⁄2 for the enzyme in the presence of isoflurane was significantly different from the control (p , 0.04).

results were obtained with other anesthetics (data not shown).
the effects of volatile anesthetics on the enzyme were subsequently examined at 25 °c by two experimental approaches:
ca21-atpase activity assay and fluorescence spectroscopy
measurements. fig. 4 shows that at this temperature the activity is also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, similar to
the patterns observed at 37 °c except that higher concentrations are required for a comparable extent of inhibition. this
temperature dependence is in agreement with nonpolar interactions between each anesthetic and the enzyme (collins and
washabaugh, 1985; makhatadze and privalov, 1995).
the effect of anesthetics on the functionally important enzyme conformation has been assessed by measuring the calcium-dependent increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
induced by substrate ca21 binding and in addition, by the
decrease of the fluorescence of an external probe, fitc, bound
in the active site of the enzyme. as shown in fig. 5 the ca21induced increase in tryptophan fluorescence is attenuated by
all three anesthetics in a similar dose-dependent manner. halothane effect could not be determined accurately due to the
high extent of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by this
compound. the half-maximal reduction is observed at ;0.16 –
0.26 mm concentrations of the agents in the order of efficiency
shown in fig. 5; the difference between their f50 values may be
not statistically significant. the ca21-induced fluorescence increase is readily reversed by addition of egta both in the
presence and absence of anesthetics. similar dose dependence
is observed in the attenuation of the ca21-dependent decrease
in fitc fluorescence, even though the df/dftotal does not
proceed to 0 (fig. 6). thus, there is a good correlation between
the inhibitory action of the anesthetics on the ca21-atpase
activity ( xxxd1289xxx  5 0.20 – 0.27 mm) and the ca21-induced conformational change assessed by either tryptophan or fitc fluorescence measurements (f50 5 0.16 – 0.23 mm).
we have also analyzed the anesthetics effects on the total
tryptophan fluorescence intensity of ca21-atpase. all four
studied compounds decrease the fluorescence in a dose-dependent linear fashion (fig. 7). in order to distinguish which type of
quenching process is taking place, lifetime fluorescence inten-

appropriate blood/gas partition coefficients (eger, 1974; koblin, 1990;
kosk-kosicka and roszczynska, 1993). inhibitory potencies are expressed in millimolar concentrations (in the reaction mixture) that
half-maximally inhibit ca21-atpase activity of the purified dimeric
enzyme. both sets of values were obtained at 37 °c, i.e. human body

enzyme concentration was 70 nm. fluorescence increase recorded at
330 nm was induced upon addition of 1.2 mm free ca21. the ca21-dependent change in tryptophan fluorescence in the control in the absence
of anesthetics (1.2–2% of the total tryptophan fluorescence) is shown as
100%. the df/dftotal at each anesthetic concentration is expressed in
percent of the ca21-dependent fluorescence increase in the presence of

sity measurements were performed in the presence and absence of isoflurane. as shown in table i intensity decays are
very heterogenous and three exponentials are needed to fit the
data. this is expected for a protein with several tryptophans
and was observed previously for the sr ca21-atpase (lakowicz et al., 1986; gryczynski et al., 1989; wang et al., 1992). in
the presence of isoflurane the lifetimes decrease (compare exponential fits x2r and ,t. in table i). these changes in lifetimes are characteristic of collisional quenching (pesce et al.,
1971; lakowicz, 1991). on the other hand the apparent
quenching constants, kapp, calculated from the decrease in
fluorescence intensity (in fig. 7 and table ii) are larger than
those possible if collisional quenching were entirely responsible
for the observed fluorescence decrease (for example, for other

such as binding of the quencher and conformational changes

recorded for the enzyme in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of isoflurane show a progressive decrease of
intensity and a red shift of up to 6 nm at 0.52 mm isoflurane
concentration (fig. 8), suggesting an increased polarity of the
tryptophan environment that could result from a conformational change caused by the interacting anesthetic. it has been
shown that conformational changes caused by partial denaturation of protein result in fluorescence intensity and lifetime
decreases and a red shift of the spectrum (gryczynski et al.,

about 2-fold lower anesthetic concentrations are required for
inhibition of the purified plasma membrane ca21-atpase activity as compared to the enzyme in the erythrocyte ghost
membrane (fig. 9:  xxxd1289xxx  5 0.26 and 0.50 mm halothane) suggests
that the lower apparent quenching constants for the enzyme in
sr may be caused by a decrease of tryptophans accessibility to
the anesthetics by the lipid bilayer. a similar difference in
halothane sensitivity of the ca21-atpase in ghost membrane
versus purified was observed previously at 37 °c (kosk-kosicka
and roszczynska, 1993). as shown in fig. 9, the ca21-atpase
in sr requires a 40 –50% higher halothane concentration for
half-maximal inhibition than the enzyme in erythrocyte membrane. this result and the fact that at concentrations up to 0.2
mm halothane the enzyme in sr is activated, in contrast to the
plasma membrane ca21-atpase (fig. 9), indicate that in addition to the lipid effect, the nonpolar sites in the sr enzyme
may have a lower affinity for the anesthetics than comparable
sites in the plasma membrane enzyme.
discussion

we have shown that volatile anesthetics affect both the
conformational state and activity of the ca21-atpase. there is
a strong correlation between the attenuation of the ca21-induced functionally important conformational change of the protein and impairment of its enzymatic function by anesthetics.
also our data on anesthetic effects on the total tryptophan
fluorescence, including the decrease of fluorescence intensity,
the red shift, and the decrease in lifetimes, indicate that anesthetics produce conformational changes in the enzyme molecule. to explain these effects we suggest that the anesthetics
enter the protein and interact with nonpolar amino acids in its
interior. to accommodate the intruding anesthetic the protein
molecule undergoes structural rearrangement that results in
the loss of its ca21-atpase activity. in proposing this mechanism of anesthetic action on the ca21-atpase we are considering multiple x-ray diffraction and nmr data that have demonstrated binding of gaseous anesthetics and other molecules,
including urea and steroids, in hydrophobic “cavities” in the
interior of several proteins (schoenborn, 1965; schoenborn et
al., 1965; schoenborn and featherstone, 1967; nunes and
schoenborn, 1973; brown et al., 1976; sachsenheimer et al.,

tophans by the anesthetics we have tested the effect of anesthetics on the fluorescence of the heat-denaturated enzyme and
on free tryptophan in the same reaction mixture, including
detergent. the free tryptophan fluorescence was not affected
while there was a decrease in the fluorescence of the denatured
enzyme. in addition, no fluorescence resonance energy transfer
was observed between tryptophan and anesthetics (no overlap
of absorption and emission spectra). all these findings point to
a substantial contribution of conformational change of the enzyme in the anesthetic effect on the total tryptophan
fluorescence.
to examine the contribution of lipids in the decrease of total
tryptophan fluorescence due to anesthetics we investigated
their action on the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca21-atpase. this
enzyme could be studied in the native membrane because it
constitutes '80% of the total membrane protein as compared
to '0.01% of the membrane protein represented by the ca21atpase in the plasma membrane. tryptophan fluorescence of
the sr enzyme is reduced by the four anesthetics with the same
order of efficiency as observed for the purified plasma membrane ca21-atpase (table ii). also similar to the plasma membrane enzyme, the apparent quenching constants are too large
for an exclusively diffusion controlled process. they are approximately two times lower than for the purified plasma membrane enzyme. the difference could arise from either an interference of the surrounding lipids or differences in the enzyme
protein molecules such as existence of fewer sites for interaction with the anesthetics in the sr enzyme or their lower
affinity than in the plasma membrane enzyme. the fact that

born, 1969, 1976; settle, 1973; tilton et al., 1984, 1986; nunes
and schoenborn, 1973). generally, the binding appears stronger for smaller and more polarizable molecules (nunes and
schoenborn, 1973). the findings suggest selectivity in the interactions between anesthetics and proteins and a requirement
for compatibility between the nonpolar sites available in the
protein (proper steric arrangement of amino acid side chains)
and the intruding molecule (size, shape, and polarizability).
the ca21-atpase seems to have a fitting nonpolar site(s)
available to all five volatile anesthetics studied in our laboratory (present paper and in kosk-kosicka and roszczynska,
1993) and to xenon (franks et al., 1995) as judged by their
inhibitory effects. temperature effects (on the ca21-atpase
activity) support a nonpolar nature of interactions between the
anesthetics and the amino acids in the ca21-atpase. it would
be worthwhile to investigate effects of bigger or/and less polarizable anesthetic molecules on the enzyme to further test our
hypothesis.

fig. 9. comparison of the effect of halothane on the ca21atpase activity in the purified ca21-atpase (*), ca21-atpase in
erythrocyte ghost membranes (e), and ca21-atpase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (m). the activity assay was performed at 25 °c as
described under “materials and methods.” the reaction mixture for
sarcoplasmic reticulum contained the divalent cation ionophore a23187
(10 mm) and the reaction time was 15 min as compared to 30 min for the
plasma membrane ca21-atpase. for both membranes the ca21atpase activity was calculated as the difference between the activity
detected in the presence of both mg21 and ca21 ions and absence of
ca21 ions. the specific ca21-atpase activities (in mmol of pi/mg of
protein/h) were 100 in sr and 0.35 in erythrocyte ghosts.

molecule their binding is expected to affect internal motions
and conformational substates of the enzyme (schoenborn,
1965; brown et al., 1976; hibbard and tulinsky, 1978; tilton et
al., 1984; lim et al., 1994). the observed effects on total tryptophan fluorescence might then reflect the invasion that results in subtle conformational changes including tryptophan
environment. the lack of the ca21-sensitive increase in tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of anesthetics would reflect
the increased stability of the substate characteristic of a nonactive enzyme: enzyme with bound anesthetic cannot attain
the conformation necessary for its normal activation. as a
result no ca21-atpase activity can be detected. recent studies,
including investigation of the effects of amino acid mutations in
the hydrophobic core of l-repressor on internal packing interactions, have demonstrated that the protein accommodates the
potentially disruptive residues with shifts in its a-helical arrangement and becomes more stable since its packing is improved. however, the rearrangements cause repositioning of
functional residues, which results in reduced function of the
protein (lim and sauer, 1991; lim et al., 1994). by analogy, a
distortion of amino acid side chain(s) (resulting from anesthetic
binding to the ca21-atpase) that normally coordinate to ca21
may cause a change in ca21 binding and this slightly changed
substate may not reveal the expected tryptophan fluorescence
increase. the small shift observed in ca21 affinity at 37 °c
favors this interpretation as opposed to a total loss of ca21
binding in the presence of an anesthetic. alternatively, insertion of the anesthetic and the resulting rearrangement may
affect not ca21 binding but the coupling between the ca21
binding and induction of a proper conformation that in the
active enzyme is detected as the ca21-dependent change in
tryptophan fluorescence. anesthetics effects on the conformational change (normally reflected in ca21-dependent changes
in fluorescence of either tryptophan or fitc) correlate well
with their effects on the ca21-atpase activity in support of the
interpretation that anesthetics prevent the enzyme from assuming a functionally proper active conformation. this suggestion is consistent with the observation that two activation
pathways of the enzyme, by dimerization of enzyme monomers
and by calmodulin binding to enzyme monomers, are inhibited
by anesthetics to a comparable extent implying a “basic” defect
in the activation mechanism. in contrast, the two pathways are
affected distinctly different by two other groups of general
anesthetics, barbiturates and alkanols (kosk-kosicka et al.,
1995a).1 these compounds with the structural properties of
detergents are postulated to inhibit ca21-atpase monomers
by binding to an exposed nonpolar patch on the enzyme surface
to which calmodulin binds to activate monomers and which is
not easily accessible in enzyme dimers.
selectivity of anesthetic action on the ca21-atpase—the
reviewed effects on the plasma membrane ca21-atpase occur
at clinical anesthetic concentrations. the ca21-atpase in sarcoplasmic reticulum is also sensitive to the anesthetics in this
concentration range. its activity is inhibited half-maximally by
halothane at an approximately 50% higher concentration than
the ca21-atpase in the plasma membrane (fig. 9; see also
kosk-kosicka and roszczynska (1993)). also for this ca21atpase the large quenching constants support conformational
changes in the presence of anesthetics (table ii). we expect
then that the inhibition results from the anesthetic binding in
nonpolar sites which correspond to those in the plasma membrane ca21-atpase (although in sr they may have lower affinity for the anesthetics) and the final consequences of restriction of protein motions are similar in the two ca21transporting enzymes. we have, however, demonstrated a
significant difference between the response of the two enzymes

to lower anesthetic concentrations. the initial activation phase
observed only for the sr ca21-atpase (fig. 9) which correlates
with its effect of the ca21-induced tryptophan fluorescence4
may be due to changes in its oligomeric size (from bigger to
smaller oligomers, as suggested by karon et al. (1994) based on
the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy data).
in contrast to ca21-atpase, two other plasma membrane
atpases, the na1,k1-atpase and mg21-atpase, require at
least 3–5 times higher concentrations of volatile anesthetics.2
several other membrane proteins that have been reported as
potential targets for anesthetics, including voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, are half-maximally
inhibited only at halothane concentrations ranging from 4 to 30
times higher than its clinical potency, as summarized in a
recent review of the last 10 years of search for the target of
anesthetic action (franks and lieb, 1994). from among many
proteins shown to be affected by the anesthetics only ligandgated ion channels, including gaba receptors and possibly
 xxxg456xxx , are also targeted at clinical
anesthetic concentrations. studies performed in many laboratories imply gabaa receptors channel complex as a major
target for the general anesthetics (for review, see franks and
lieb (1994)). the pharmacological target is expected to be
affected by anesthetics at their clinical concentrations ('1
mac) because the dose-response curves for the induction of
anesthesia with volatile anesthetics are very steep (concentrations 20% above 1 mac anesthetize almost all subjects) and
because concentrations 2– 4 times higher have damaging side
effects on the organism. our findings indicate that the anesthetics action on the ca21-atpase is selective at their pharmacological concentrations. it remains to be tested whether
anesthetic action on the ca21-atpases and the receptors at the
molecular level is exerted by their binding in protein interior.
our hypothesis cannot be verified at present without x-ray
structure data.
the finding that volatile anesthetics inhibit the ca21atpases in vitro at their clinical concentrations while several
other membrane proteins are affected by the anesthetics only
at concentrations significantly exceeding those used in the
clinical situation opens a possibility that the enzyme is perturbed during anesthesia and this anesthetic action has important physiological consequences. the consequences would be
multiple as so many cellular events and cascades depend on
precisely controlled intracellular ca21 concentrations, ranging
from regulation of cell shape in erythrocytes, to neuronal transmission to depression of contractile force in heart.
in conclusion, we propose that the observed correlation between the attenuation of the functionally important conformational change of the enzyme and inhibition of its ca21-atpase
activity could be explained by permeation of the protein molecule by volatile anesthetic and stabilization of its nonactive
conformational substate. we view this process as an example of
a general phenomena of discriminating binding of small ligands in protein interior.

the concentrations of volatile anesthetics in the in vitro
assays described in our publication are 10-fold higher than
indicated. as a result, only the initial activation of the sr
ca21-atpase, in contrast to the inhibition of the plasma membrane ca21-atpase, occurs at clinical concentrations of volatile
anesthetics. the kapp calculated from tryptophan quenching
experiments using the corrected anesthetic concentrations are
about 10-fold lower, i.e. more comparable to the values obtained
for other proteins. the concentration error does not affect the
main findings of our paper which suggest that the anesthetics
interfere with enzymatic function by binding in nonpolar sites
in protein interior and modifying conformational substate(s) of
the enzyme.
