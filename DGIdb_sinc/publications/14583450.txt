abstract
ribonucleotide reductase (rr) is responsible for the de novo conversion
of the  xxxd2246xxx  diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates,
which are essential for dna synthesis and repair. rr consists of two
subunits, hrrm1 and hrrm2.  xxxg1993xxx  is a new rr family member.
because the majority of human tumors possess mutant p53, it is important
to know the molecular mechanism by which mutant p53 regulates rr and
to what extent. in this study, we investigated the expression and function
of  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2 after uv treatment in human prostate cancer  xxxg1682xxx 
cells, which possess mutant p53 with a truncated cooh-terminal, and in
human oropharyngeal cancer kb cells, which possess wild-type p53.
 xxxg1993xxx  (analyzed by western blot and standardized relative to coomassie
blue-stained band) was down-regulated in  xxxg1682xxx  cells and up-regulated in
kb cells after uv exposure. in contrast, hrrm2 was up-regulated by uv
in both  xxxg1682xxx  cells and kb cells. hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  mrna levels were
assessed by northern blot, and the results paralleled that of the western
blot. coimmunoprecipitation assays using agarose-conjugated goat antihuman  xxxg1991xxx  antibody confirmed that the  xxxg1993xxx  binding to hrrm1
decreased in  xxxg1682xxx  cells but increased in kb cells after uv treatment.
hrrm2 binding to hrrm1 increased in both cell lines under the same
conditions. these results suggest that  xxxg1682xxx  cells are deficient in both
transcription of  xxxg1993xxx  and binding to hrrm1 in response to uv irradiation. confocal microscopy further confirmed that these findings were not
due to translocation of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus. rr activity was measured following uv treatment and shown to
increase in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. it was unchanged in proportional of kb cells. the
rr activity is consistent with the expression of hrrm2 seen in the
western blots. thus, we hypothesize that hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  to
form rr holoenzyme and maintain rr activity in  xxxg1682xxx  cells after uv
treatment. to further confirm this hypothesis, we examined the effect of
 xxxg1992xxx  inhibitors on cells exposed to uv. in  xxxg1682xxx  cells, hydroxyurea
inhibited hrrm2 and resulted in increased sensitivity to uv irradiation.
we also examined the effect of uv treatment on the colony-forming ability
of cells transfected with hrrm2 as well as  xxxg1993xxx  sense or antisense
expression vectors. expression of antisense hrrm2 in  xxxg1682xxx  cells led to
decreased hrrm2 expression and resulted in greater sensitivity to uv
than observed in wild-type  xxxg1682xxx  cells. taken together, we conclude that
uv-induced activation of  xxxg1993xxx  transcription and binding of  xxxg1993xxx 
to hrrm1 to form rr holoenzyme are impaired in the p53-mutant cell
line  xxxg1682xxx .

to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates that are essential for dna synthesis and repair (1, 2). rr consists of two subunits, m1 and m2. m1
(hrrm1) is a mr 170,000 dimer with a binding site for enzyme
regulators (3). m2 (hrrm2) is a mr 88,000 dimer containing a
tyrosine free radical and a non-heme iron for enzyme activity (3). the
enzyme is expressed specifically in s phase and is rate-limiting for
dna synthesis. therefore, rr plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (1–5). recently, a new rr family member,
 xxxg1993xxx , was cloned by tanaka et al. (6).  xxxg1993xxx  contains a p53-binding
site in intron 1 and encodes a 351-amino acid peptide with striking
similarity to hrrm2 (6). expression of  xxxg1993xxx , but not hrrm2, is
induced by uv light, ␥-irradiation, or adriamycin treatment in a
p53-dependent manner (6 – 8). the discovery of  xxxg1993xxx  suggests a
relationship between rr activity and repair of damaged dna (6).
tanaka et al. (6) reported that  xxxg1993xxx  supports dna repair by increasing the dntp pool needed for repair. inhibition of endogenous
 xxxg1993xxx  expression in cells that have a p53-dependent dna damage
checkpoint led to reduced rr activity, dna repair, and cell survival
after exposure to various genotoxins. guittet et al. (7) further reported
that  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm1 generate a rr holoenzyme that is directly
involved in p53-directed repair of damaged dna. although the role
of  xxxg1993xxx  in the dna repair pathway has been defined, it is still
unclear whether this function of  xxxg1993xxx  is altered in cell with a mutant
p53 phenotype.
p53 has been shown to participate in several cellular responses that
could contribute to the suppression of tumor development, including
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (9 –13). activation of p53 in response
to stress signals such as dna damage is thought to prevent the
replication of abnormal cells by either allowing their repair or targeting them for elimination. however, it was not clear whether p53
contributed directly to dna repair until  xxxg1993xxx  was cloned. in most
cells, wt p53 exists in a latent form and in very low concentrations. in
response to stress, upstream signals activate p53 to respond to the
need for dna repair. the amount of wt p53 is rapidly increased in
cells; it activates transcription of target genes. the increased p53 level
may be due to an increased half-life or to an increase in the rate of
transcription. it has been reported that wt p53 may activate transcription of  xxxg1993xxx  in response to uv light (6). however, it has never been
clear whether mutant p53 directs transcription of  xxxg1993xxx  or other rr
subunits or alters their interaction (14).
exposure of mammalian cells to uv irradiation leads to the introduction of a number of photoproducts in cellular dna. these are
removed by the ner pathway. damaged nucleotides are excised
together with a number of adjacent nucleotides (15), and the resulting
gaps are filled in by dna polymerase and sealed by ligase. to fill
these gaps, cells need precursors for dna synthesis. rr is a unique
enzyme that can supply these precursors (16, 17). it has been shown
that ner normally occurs within 3 h of dna damage (18). therefore,
cells need to have rapid mechanisms to supply precursors for prompt
dna repair. regulation of  xxxg1993xxx  by p53 may fill this need. rapid
induction of rr activity may be achieved by releasing  xxxg1993xxx  from an
inactive complex with p53, freeing it to bind to hrrm1 and form an
active holoenzyme. activation of  xxxg1993xxx  transcription by p53 may
then provide additional  xxxg1993xxx  in a slower fashion to maintain rr

hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  in response to dna repair

activity at later times. this hypothesis was suggested by our previous
report that  xxxg1993xxx  binds to p53 but is released within 3 h of uv
irradiation, whereupon it binds to hrrm1 and forms an active holoenzyme (14). this mechanism would be more rapid than a transcriptional mechanism. therefore, it is important to examine the
regulation of  xxxg1993xxx  after uv exposure in a time-dependent manner.
the role of hrrm2 in dna repair has lately become controversial.
in a mouse study, the level of  xxxg1992xxx  decreased in g1- and g2-phase
cells but increased during s phase, suggesting that it may not be
involved in dna repair (19, 20). others have suggested that hrrm2
only supplies dntps for dna replication in s phase, whereas  xxxg1993xxx 
replaces it to supply dntps needed for dna repair during g1 and g2
phases (6). p53 contributes to the activation of g2 cell cycle arrest in
response to dna damage. however, cells transfected with  xxxg1993xxx 
show only a slightly elevated number of cells in s-g2-phase after uv
treatment (21), suggesting that cell cycle arrest in response to dna
damage requires signals in addition to  xxxg1993xxx  (6, 19). the hrrm2
gene is expressed during the cell cycle in s-g2 phase (22–25). it has
been reported that hrrm2 plays a role in repairing uv-induced dna
damage outside of s phase in yeast (26). the response of hrrm2 to
ionizing radiation in human cervical carcinoma cells has also been
examined (27). therefore, it remains unclear whether the hrrm2
gene plays a role in dna repair in p53 wt or mutant lines. it has been
known that the process of carcinogenesis results from a long-term
exposure to a low dosage of the dna damage agent. our rationale,
then, was to apply sublethal-dose uv irradiation rather than high-dose
␥-irradiation to demonstrate how hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  are involved in
dna repair.
because the majority of human tumors possess mutant p53, it is
important to know the molecular mechanism by which mutant p53
regulates rr in response to uv-induced dna damage. in this study,
we investigated the expression and function of  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2
after uv treatment in human prostate cancer cells ( xxxg1682xxx ), which
possess mutant p53 with a truncated cooh-terminal.

cells were treated with uv or uv plus hu and then incubated at 37°c for 8
generation times (6 days), and the number of colonies (⬎50 cells) was counted.

added to induce m2 cdna expression before uv treatment.
cell cycle analysis. exponentially growing  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells (1 ⫻ 106)
were treated with uv (10 j/m2 for  xxxg1682xxx  cells; 20 j/m2 for kb cells), and cells
were harvested after 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 16, 24, and 48 h. cells were then washed
with pbs, fixed with 70% ethanol, and pretreated with 10 ␮g/ml rnase
(sigma). cells were further stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (10 ␮g/ml; sigma)
and analyzed by flow cytometry. the cell cycle profile was determined by
using program m software on an epics flow cytometer (city of hope core
facility).
northern blot analysis and rpa. exponentially growing  xxxg1682xxx  and kb
cells were treated with uv (10 j/m2 for  xxxg1682xxx  cells; 20 j/m2 for kb cells), and
total rna was extracted after the designated number of hours. rna was
separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto hybond-n membrane. hybridization was performed under stringent conditions
using radioactive probes that were prepared as described previously (5). blots
were probed with pcr products consisting of full-length hrrm2 or  xxxg1993xxx 
cdna, and rna loading was normalized by probing for  xxxg861xxx  expression.
multihuman tissue mrna blots were purchased from bd clontech (palo alto,
ca), and hybridization conditions followed the manufacturer’s recommended
protocol. for the rpa, the multi-probe template set containing human cell
cycle-related gene dna templates (hcc templates) was purchased from
pharmingen international (san diego, ca). the manufacturer’s protocol was
followed in this study.

times in pbs, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (fitc-conjugated goat antirabbit for hrrm2, rhodamine-conjugated bovine antigoat for
 xxxg1993xxx , or both antibodies) in blocking buffer for 45 min in the dark at 37°c.
glass slides were washed three times in pbs and mounted with a coverslip
with 90% glycerol in pbs. images were acquired using a confocal microscope
(zeiss).
rr activity assay. the rr activity assay was performed as described
previously. in brief, 1 ⫻ 107 cells were plated in a 150-mm dish and incubated
for 24 h. then the cells were treated with uv irradiation (10 j/m2 for  xxxg1682xxx 
cells; 20 j/m2 for kb cells) and harvested at the indicated time points. cells
were washed twice with cold pbs and detached by trypsin and a cell scraper.
cells were transferred to a 15-ml tube and pelleted by centrifugation at
300 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4°c. the pellets were washed again with pbs. one
volume of low-salt homogenization buffer [10 mm hepes (ph7.2) and 2 mm
dtt] was added to the cell pellets, and the cell suspension was passed through
a needle 20 times on ice. after homogenization, one volume of high-salt buffer
[1 m hepes (ph 7.2) and 2 mm dtt] was added, and the cell suspension was
again passed through a needle 20 times on ice. cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 16,000 ⫻ g at 4°c for 20 min. the supernatant was passed
through a sephadex g25 spin column pre-equilibrated with buffer [50 mm
hepes (ph 7.2) and 2 mm of dtt] to remove endogenous nucleotides.

protein concentration was measured by the bio-rad protein assay. the reaction mixture contained 0.15 mm [3h]cdp (0.02 ␮ci), 2 mm atp, 0.05 mm
cdp, 50 mm hepes (ph 7.2), 6 mm dtt, 4 mm magnesium acetate, and
differing amounts of cell extract in a final volume of 0.15 ml. after a 20-min
incubation, the dcdp formed was dephosphorylated by phosphodiesterase, and
c and dc were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography with a
c18 ion-exchange column. the cytidine and  xxxd1836xxx  peaks were collected in scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was measured with
a beckman ls 5000ce liquid scintillation counter. specific activity was
calculated as nmol cdp/h/mg protein.

fig. 2. western blot and cell cycle profile analysis of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  protein expression in
 xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells after uv irradiation. total cellular protein (100 ␮g/lane) was extracted from  xxxg1682xxx 
and kb cells after uv irradiation and from parallel
control cells not exposed to uv and analyzed by
western blot using anti-hrrm2 and - xxxg1993xxx  antibodies. the cbb was used to control for the total

show the amount of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  detected in

and standardized by the cbb control. the effect of

the cell cycle profile of  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells at the

creased in skeletal muscle tissue and decreased in thymus tissue. in
fig. 1b, protein expression detected by western blot showed a high
level of hrrm2 expression in fetal liver and moderate expression in
testis, but low expression in other tissues.  xxxg1993xxx  was expressed
relatively highly in all tissues except liver (fig. 1b). these results
indicate that expression of  xxxg1993xxx  is much more widespread than that
of hrrm2. moreover, posttranscriptional regulation of hrrm2 and
 xxxg1993xxx  might explain the inconsistent expression between mrna and
protein levels. because most human tumor cells possess mutant p53,
we assessed the expression of  xxxg1993xxx  in a range of tumor cell lines by
western blot (fig. 1c). kb and hepg2 cells, which all possess wt
p53, expressed an equally high level of  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2. interestingly, both  xxxg1682xxx  and du145 cells possess mutant p53, but they express
hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  proteins in different ratios. however, expression
of  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2 was nearly undetectable in hep3b cells, which
are p53 null. this result suggests that the status of p53 does not
directly influence the expression of  xxxg1993xxx  or hrrm2 unless it remains null. furthermore, uv irradiation (20 j/m2) was used to induce
hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  expression in five cell lines. after 24 h of uv
irradiation, hrrm2 increased in all five cell lines. the increased

expression of hrrm2 is less significant in p53-mutant  xxxg1682xxx  and
du145 cells but more prominent in p53 wt kb and hepg2 cells. of
interest,  xxxg1993xxx  was only up-regulated in kb and hepg2 cells, and not
in p53-mutant  xxxg1682xxx  and du145 cells. our results suggested that
hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  can be induced by a sublethal dose of uv
irradiation when the cells possess p53 wt status, whereas hrrm2 and
 xxxg1993xxx  are barely induced by uv irradiation in p53-mutant cells.
mdm2, the known p53 direct target gene, was also used as control.
mdm2 was induced by uv irradiation in kb and hepg2 cells but
decreased in  xxxg1682xxx  and du145 cells. thus, kb and  xxxg1682xxx  cells were
selected for the following studies based on the different p53 status and
equally high expression of both hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  protein.
expression of  xxxg1993xxx  is not induced by a sublethal dose of uv
irradiation in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. because expression of  xxxg1993xxx  has been
reported to be associated with p53 status and up-regulated by uv
irradiation, we hypothesized that exposure to uv irradiation might
affect expression of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  in  xxxg1682xxx  cells differently than
expression in kb cells. western blot analyses were used to assay the
levels of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  at various times after exposure to uv.
 xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells, growing in logarithmic phase, were exposed to uv

2, 3, 6, 12, 16, 24, and 48 h (fig. 2). total cellular proteins were
extracted and analyzed by western blot. fig. 2a shows the effect of
uv irradiation on hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx , respectively, in  xxxg1682xxx  cells,
whereas fig. 2b shows the same results for kb cells. overall, the
amount of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  was unchanged in both cell lines for up
to 3 h after exposure to uv. by 6 h after uv exposure, the amount of
hrrm2 protein in  xxxg1682xxx  cells decreased slightly compared with that in
the untreated control and then gradually increased from 12 to 24 h. at
the 24 h time point, the hrrm2 protein increased 2.5-fold relative to
the control and remained elevated (2.1-fold) after 48 h (fig. 2a). in
contrast to hrrm2, the amount of  xxxg1993xxx  protein in  xxxg1682xxx  cells increased slightly (1.2-fold) relative to the untreated sample after 6 and
12 h and then decreased from 16 to 48 h. it was 60% of the control
after 24 h and remained suppressed after 48 h (fig. 2a). in kb cells,
the amount of hrrm2 increased from 12 to 48 h after uv exposure,
as expected, whereas  xxxg1993xxx  increased slightly from 6 to 24 h (fig.
2b). quantitative analysis was performed by fluorescence imaging
and summarized in a bar graph (fig. 2, a and b, bottom panel).
to confirm that hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  induction by uv irradiation
was not simply dependent on cell cycle redistribution, flow cytometry
analysis was used. the results are summarized in fig. 2, c and d. the
cell cycle distribution of  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells did not change significantly at various time points in the uv(⫺) panel. after a sublethal
dose of uv irradiation, no cell cycle redistribution could be seen in
 xxxg1682xxx  cells from the 0 to 24 h time points. s-phase augmentation was
detected at 48 h. after uv irradiation, an s-phase increase could be

seen, starting from 16 h in kb cells and continuing to increase
significantly at 24 and 48 h. these results indicate that  xxxg1993xxx  and
hrrm2 induction by uv irradiation was not concordant with cell
cycle redistribution in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. the different expression pattern of
hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  induced by a sublethal dose of uv might be
related to p53 status.
to further confirm this phenomenon, northern blot analysis of
hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  expression was performed (fig. 3). because no
change in mrna level was detected until 6 h after uv treatment, we
only show the amount of mrna detected after 6 h. the 12 and 16 h
time points were similar to the 24 h time point. the result demonstrated here only included the 0, 6, 24 and 48 h time points. in  xxxg1682xxx 
cells, the pattern of hrrm2 mrna expression was consistent with
the western blot, showing a slight decrease after 6 h and then
increasing to more than 2.8-fold greater than the untreated control
after 24 h and remaining increased 1.2-fold after 48 h (fig. 3a). in
contrast to hrrm2, the amount of  xxxg1993xxx  mrna decreased to half of
the control levels after 24 h and kept decreasing to 24% of the control
after 48 h (fig. 3a). in kb cells, hrrm2 mrna gradually increased
to 2.3-fold greater than the control 24 h after uv treatment and then
decreased at the 48 h time point, whereas  xxxg1993xxx  mrna expression
decreased at 6 h but increased 3-fold as compared with control at 24 h
and then decreased at 48 h (fig. 3b). to further confirm that p53
directed hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  in response to uv irradiation, we analyzed the p53 and p21 mrna expression level using rpa. in fig. 3c,
p53 mutated  xxxg1682xxx  cells; the p53 mrna was barely detectable even
after exposure to uv, whereas p21 increased significantly at 6 h after

hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  in response to dna repair

from  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells after uv irradiation and from parallel control cells not exposed to uv. in addition to hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  mrna,  xxxg861xxx  cdna probes were used to control
for the total amount of mrna present in each lane. a and b show the amount of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  mrna detected in  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells at the indicated times. the intensity of each
band was measured by phosphorimager, and the amount of hrrm2 or  xxxg1993xxx  mrna is presented as a ratio of uv(⫹)/uv(⫺) after normalization to the  xxxg861xxx  control. c and d
show the amount of p53 and p21 mrna detected in  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells at the indicated times by rpa. the intensity of each band was measured by phosphorimager, and the amount
of p53 or p21 mrna is presented as a ratio of uv(⫹)/uv(⫺) after normalization to the  xxxg861xxx  control.

uv irradiation. in fig. 3d, p53 and p21 increased after 6 h of uv
irradiation in kb cells. p21 decreased slightly at 24 h but increased
significantly at 48 h. p53, however, remained without much change
between 24 and 48 h. thus, the hrrm2 response to uv seems p53
independent, whereas  xxxg1993xxx  could only be induced when the cell
possessed wt p53. the increase of p21 during treatment with a
sublethal dose of uv irradiation demonstrated integrity of p53 func-

tion. overall, the mrna expression was consistent with protein
expression for all conditions.
uv irradiation induces binding of hrrm2 but not  xxxg1993xxx  to
hrrm1 in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. rr holoenzyme is formed by the binding of
hrrm2 or  xxxg1993xxx  to hrrm1. to further explore the function of
 xxxg1993xxx  in  xxxg1682xxx  cells, immunoprecipitation using hrrm1 antibodyconjugated agarose beads was used to investigate the interaction

hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  in response to dna repair

fig. 4. immunoprecipitation of proteins bound to
hrrm1.  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells were irradiated with 5 j/m2
uv. cells were harvested 24 h later, and protein lysates
were prepared. antibodies to hrrm1 were used to immunoprecipitate lysates from both control and uv-irradiated cells, and then protein-bound  xxxg1993xxx  (top panels)
and hrrm2 (bottom panels) was detected by western
blot. proteins eluted from the immunoprecipitated antihrrm1 antibody beads (elu) and from the total lysates
(lys) were detected for each sample.

between rr subunits after uv exposure. as shown in fig. 4, coimmunoprecipitation of  xxxg1993xxx  (top panels) and hrrm2 (bottom panels)
was detected by western blot (described in “materials and methods”).
in both  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells,  xxxg1993xxx  is strongly associated with hrrm1
in the absence of uv treatment, whereas binding of hrrm2 to
hrrm1 is barely detectable, as expected. although binding to
hrrm1 was significantly different in untreated cells, nearly equal
amounts of  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2 were detected in the total protein
lysates. in  xxxg1682xxx  cells, the binding of  xxxg1993xxx  to hrrm1 decreased,
whereas the binding of hrrm2 increased slightly 3 h after uv
exposure. by 24 h after uv treatment, binding of  xxxg1993xxx  remained
suppressed, whereas binding of hrrm2 increased further. the
amount of total  xxxg1993xxx  in the  xxxg1682xxx  cell lysates was slightly decreased
relative to the control but was still present, whereas the amount of
hrrm2 increased over time, consistent with the previous western
blots (fig. 2). in kb cells, the binding of both  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2 to
hrrm1 increased after uv treatment. these finding suggest that the
defect in  xxxg1993xxx  binding to hrrm1 to form rr holoenzyme after uv
treatment is p53 dependent. furthermore, the observation that  xxxg1993xxx 
and hrrm2 each bind to hrrm1 after uv treatment in the presence
of wt p53 suggests that both of these subunits may contribute to rr
activity in response to the need for dna repair.
deficiency of  xxxg1993xxx  binding with hrrm1 is not due to cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of  xxxg1993xxx  after uv irradiation in  xxxg1682xxx 
cells. to further explore the underlying mechanism of p53-mediated
binding of  xxxg1993xxx  to hrrm1 observed by immunoprecipitation, we
examined the effect of uv irradiation on the localization of  xxxg1993xxx 
and hrrm2 in  xxxg1682xxx  cells by confocal scanning microscopy (fig. 5).
before uv treatment, both hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  are localized throughout the cytoplasm. both subunits translocated from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus as early as 1 h after uv irradiation and continued to
accumulate in the nucleus for at least 3 h. by 24 h after uv exposure,
both hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  were still in the nucleus of some cells, but
they had reverted to cytoplasmic localization on most cells. similar

results were obtained for kb cells (data not shown). these results
indicate that both hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  move rapidly from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to uv exposure but mostly revert to
cytoplasmic localization after 24 h. the appearance of both  xxxg1993xxx 
and hrrm2 in the nucleus of  xxxg1682xxx  cells suggests that the deficiency
of  xxxg1993xxx  binding to hrrm1 observed by immunoprecipitation is
unrelated to their ability to translocate.
rr activity is not altered in  xxxg1682xxx  cells compared with kb
cells in response to uv treatment, suggesting that hrrm2
complements  xxxg1993xxx  to form rr holoenzyme. specific rr activity was examined in untreated kb and  xxxg1682xxx  cells and at various
times after uv treatment and is summarized in fig. 6. rr activity
was significantly greater in kb cells than in  xxxg1682xxx  cells (3-fold
higher). rr activity in  xxxg1682xxx  cells increased 2-fold 3 h after uv
exposure and then decreased slightly after 6 h, consistent with the
protein levels observed in the western blot. it is interesting to note
that rr activity in  xxxg1682xxx  cells peaked after 24 h, which is inconsistent with the level of  xxxg1993xxx  but consistent with the amount of
hrrm2 seen by western blot. these results also correspond to the
increased binding of hrrm2 to hrrm1 detected in the coimmunoprecipitation study. taken together, this suggests that the increased rr activity in  xxxg1682xxx  cells after 24 h is due to increased
expression and binding of hrrm2 to hrrm1 independent of
 xxxg1993xxx  and that in the presence of mutant p53, hrrm2 is able to
complement  xxxg1993xxx  to maintain rr activity needed for dna
repair. rr activity in kb cells was proportionately higher than that
observed in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. after 2 h, rr activity was increased
1.4-fold relative to the control, and after 24 h, it was increased
2.3-fold. these results are consistent with the up-regulation of
hrrm2 expression seen in kb cells as well as the coimmunoprecipitation results. therefore, we conclude that hrrm2 does contribute to rr activity associated with dna repair and that it is able
to complement defects in  xxxg1993xxx  expression associated with p53
mutation.

hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  in response to dna repair

fixed and stained for hrrm2 (fitc-conjugated goat antirabbit hrrm2; green) or  xxxg1993xxx  (rhodamine-conjugated bovine antigoat  xxxg1993xxx ; red) and visualized by confocal microscopy.
colocalization of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  is indicated by the yellow color in the merged images.

inhibition of colony formation by hu results in increased
cytotoxicity to  xxxg1682xxx  cells treated with uv. to further confirm that
hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  to provide nucleotides needed in cells
with mutant p53, we treated  xxxg1682xxx  cells with hu, a specific inhibitor of
hrrm2, and then exposed them to uv. the results, shown in fig. 7,
indicate that inhibition of hrrm2 led to enhanced sensitivity to uv
in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. colony formation was suppressed by 10% for cells
exposed to 1.25 j/m2 uv in the presence of hu relative to the same
cells without hu. suppression increased to 80% when the uv dose
was increased to 2.5 j/m2. these results provide further evidence that
hrrm2 contributes to rr activity in response to dna damage,
complementing defects in  xxxg1993xxx  in cells with mutant p53. our

of  xxxg1682xxx  and kb cells transfected with inducible hrrm2 antisense
( xxxg1682xxx -m2as and kb-m2as) or sense ( xxxg1682xxx -m2s and kb-m2s) expression vectors. as shown in fig. 8a, hrrm2 protein decreased
under iptg induction of hrrm2 antisense at the 96, 120, and 144 h
time points in kb-m2as clone. hrrm2 as rna expression can be
identified at all time points under iptg induction. the  xxxg1682xxx  cells
transfected with hrrm2 antisense revealed the same expression status as kb cells (data not shown). both kb m2 sense and  xxxg1682xxx  m2
sense clones demonstrated overexpression of m2 rna and protein
(data not shown). as shown in fig. 8b, the p53-mutated  xxxg1682xxx  cells
were more sensitive to uv irradiation than the p53 wt kb cells. at a
dosage of 5 j/m2, the colony-forming ability of the  xxxg1682xxx  cell was
inhibited ⬎90%, whereas the kb cells remained at ⬎80% viability.
the colony-forming ability of  xxxg1682xxx  cells exposed to uv is suppressed
for cells expressing antisense hrrm2. when exposed to 1.25 j/m2
uv, the colony-forming ability of  xxxg1682xxx -m2as cells decreased to 20%
of the untreated control. at a dose of 2.5 j/m2 uv, the colony-forming
ability of wt  xxxg1682xxx  cells decreased to 42.5% of the untreated control,
whereas the colony-forming ability of  xxxg1682xxx -m2as decreased to 10.5%
of the untreated control. these results suggest that inhibition of
hrrm2 by antisense rna will significantly affect the ability of
hrrm2 to complement for  xxxg1993xxx  in dna repair in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. colony
formation for  xxxg1682xxx  cells transfected with the sense construct, with
increased expression of hrrm2, was essentially the same as that for
wt  xxxg1682xxx  cells or slightly elevated. the colony-forming ability of kb
cells expressing antisense hrrm2 was nearly the same as that of wt
kb cells or slightly decreased, whereas enhanced expression of
hrrm2 enhanced survival of transfected cells. these results further
confirm that hrrm2 coordinates with  xxxg1993xxx  to contribute to rr
activity in response to dna damage in cells with functional p53, but
that in the absence of functional p53-mediated induction of  xxxg1993xxx 
activity, hrrm2 complements this lack to provide the necessary
activity.

to further investigate the role of  xxxg1993xxx  in uv-induced dna
repair, we constructed pcdna-p53r2s and pcdna-p53r2as with
 xxxg1993xxx  sense or antisense fragments and delivered it into kb cells.
fig. 8c demonstrates  xxxg1993xxx  expression from wt kb, kb-pcdna3.1
(vector only), kb-p53r2s (sense-transfected clone), and kbp53r2as (antisense-transfected clone). the kb-p53r2s demonstrated a 3-fold expression of  xxxg1993xxx  compared with the control,
whereas kb-p53r2as revealed a significant decrease compared with
the control. colony-forming ability was evaluated in wt kb, kbp53r2s, and kb-p53r2as under different dosages of uv irradiation.
from the results shown in fig. 8d, the colony-forming ability of wt
kb, kb-p53r2s, and kb-p53r2as was steadily inhibited with increasing uv doses from 0 to 20 j/m2. kb-p53r2s seemed to have
more resistance to uv stress. however, kb-p53r2as was not significantly different from control. this finding further strengthened our
hypothesis that hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  when  xxxg1993xxx  is inhibited
by antisense. these results suggested that  xxxg1993xxx  expression may
enhance repair and lead to resistance to uv damage in p53 wt kb
cells, whereas hrrm2 might be more dominant when  xxxg1993xxx  is
inhibited by antisense in response to uv irradiation.
discussion
here we report that the function of  xxxg1993xxx  in response to sublethal
uv damage is p53 dependent. mutant p53 is associated with decreased formation of rr holoenzyme by binding of  xxxg1993xxx  to hrrm1
and a failure to activate transcription of  xxxg1993xxx . in addition, we have
shown that hrrm2, which is regulated independently of p53, can
complement the  xxxg1993xxx  defect to enable dna repair. an important
implication of these studies is that the role of hrrm2 in mediating
dna repair is broader than that of  xxxg1993xxx  because it is independent of
p53 status. we have shown previously that both  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2
bind to p53 (14). in addition, we have shown that  xxxg1993xxx  is able to

hrrm2 complements  xxxg1993xxx  in response to dna repair

bind to mutant p53 but is not released in response to uv stress,
preventing the formation of rr holoenzyme (14). because hrrm1
and hrrm2 do not have p53-binding sites in their promoter regions,
their expression is independent of p53 status, allowing them to respond to uv-induced dna damage in the absence of p53. the
observation that  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2 were similarly induced by uv
irradiation in kb cells suggests that both subunits play an important
role in dna repair in cells with functional p53. in this study, we
further confirmed that hrrm2 can compensate for the reduced binding of  xxxg1993xxx  to hrrm1 in cells with mutant p53. this was shown in
the immunoprecipitation experiment. in  xxxg1682xxx  cells, hrrm1 did not
bring down  xxxg1993xxx , whereas its interaction with hrrm2 was appreciably induced in response to uv irradiation. these experiments also
showed that  xxxg1993xxx  binds to hrrm1 in cells with wt p53 and that
binding is further induced upon uv treatment, which would allow for
a rapid increase in rr activity. the effect of increased hrrm2
expression in sense-transfected cells was most apparent in cells with
intact p53. decreased hrrm2 expression had a minimal effect on
antisense-transfected cells with intact p53 but resulted in increased
cell toxicity under uv treatment in cells with mutant p53. because
inhibition of hrrm2 in cells with wt p53 has little effect on sensitivity to uv, it is likely that rr activity required for dna repair is
primarily carried out by  xxxg1993xxx . however, the enhanced survival of
cells expressing increased hrrm2 implies that hrrm2 also contributes to this activity. it has been reported previously that cells lacking
functional p53 exhibited defective repair of uv damage and were
more sensitive to uv irradiation than their wt p53 counterparts (6,
21). our result supports these findings and suggests that this may be
due to defects in the ability to release bound  xxxg1993xxx  and in induction
of  xxxg1993xxx  transcription.
it has been reported that p53 plays a role in ner (29 –33). this
pathway is required for the repair of uv-induced dna damage,
removal of bulky carcinogen adducts, and repair of dna damage
caused by chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin. loss of p53
function leads to decreased repair of these lesions and is reflected by
increased sensitivity to these agents (29, 33). however, the extent of
p53 involvement in ner is not entirely clear. it has been shown that
p53 interacts directly with  xxxg725xxx , a ner component, and that other
genes implicated in repair, such as  xxxg851xxx , are regulated by p53
(34 –38). the details of  xxxg1993xxx  involvement in ner and its regulation
need further elucidation. it has also been shown that uv-induced
dna damage involves the  xxxg874xxx  subpathway of ner, but not transcription-coupled repair (30 –32, 39). in  xxxg874xxx , acute response to uv
irradiation can be measured as unscheduled dna synthesis for photoproducts such as 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidine (31, 32, 39). release of
 xxxg1993xxx  from a complex with p53 provides for rapid activation of rr,
as we have shown here. thus, our finding suggests that  xxxg1993xxx 
participates in  xxxg874xxx  repair at early times (3– 4 h after uv irradiation)
in cells with wt p53. on the other hand, in cells with mutant p53,
 xxxg1993xxx  was not released to mediate repair. in addition, transcription of
 xxxg1993xxx  was not induced, leading to a deficiency in repair and s-phase
delay 24 h after uv treatment. s-phase delay may represent an active
checkpoint response or may reflect a blockage of replication (40, 41).
in cells with deficient p53, synthesis of hrrm2 is triggered at delayed
times to complement the defect in  xxxg1993xxx . it will be of interest to
further explore the role of  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2 in cell cycle checkpoint
responses to uv radiation and the possible interaction with cyclin or
cyclin-dependent kinase.
our observations suggest that p53 status does not influence hrrm2
response to uv irradiation, including its expression or binding to
hrrm1. however, hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  expression and binding to
hrrm1 increased in response to uv irradiation (14). the role of p53
in these responses is unclear. one possibility is that p53 binds hrrm2

to block binding to hrrm1, inhibiting rr activity and keeping
synthesis of dntps low. this could explain why hrrm1 did not bind
to hrrm2 in the absence of uv irradiation. a less likely scenario is
that p53 might compete directly with hrrm1 to bind hrrm2. the
argument could also be made that posttranslational modifications are
needed for hrrm2, but not  xxxg1993xxx , to bind to hrrm1. alternatively,
 xxxg1993xxx  may interact directly with p53, whereas the interaction of
hrrm2 with p53 may be indirect through one or more intervening
proteins. it is also possible that after uv irradiation, p53 affects some
other protein bound to hrrm2. it has been shown that p53 affects
transcriptional coactivator proteins such as ccaat box-binding protein (cbp) and p300 (42– 44). these proteins function by interacting
with cellular activators, probably with multiple components of the
transcriptional machinery, and modulate p53 transcriptional activity.
more work will be necessary to identify the different mechanisms
involved in the role of p53 on the regulation of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  in
response to dna damage. the differential responses in cells with
mutant p53 make it clear that the mechanisms are not the same for
hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx .
interestingly, confocal microscopy showed that mutation of p53 did
not affect the ability of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  to shift from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus in response to uv irradiation. therefore, the previous
hypothesis that hrrm2 resides primarily in the cytoplasm and that
 xxxg1993xxx  is primarily nuclear (6, 45, 46) becomes less likely. the
dynamic shifting from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back to the
cytoplasm was the same for hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx . interestingly, rr
activity was found to be increased both at times when the localization
of hrrm2 and  xxxg1993xxx  was primarily nuclear (3 h) and at times when
it was cytoplasmic for most cells (24 h). it has been shown that rr
subunits transfer to the nucleus individually and then assemble in the
nucleus to form the holoenzyme and provide enzyme activity (47).
whereas our results are consistent with this at the 3 h time point, the
discrepancy between localization and rr activity after 24 h requires
further investigation. one possibility is that the activity of rr in the
small percentage of cells where it remained nuclear was high enough
to account for the total measured activity. alternatively, rr holoenzyme may function in the cytoplasm in addition to the nucleus. we
have preliminary results that suggest that rr may be active in the
mitochondria. this is plausible because mitochondria are also a site of
dna synthesis and repair and therefore require a pool of dntps.
it has been reported that  xxxg1993xxx  is a p53-dependent rr small
subunit (6, 48). however, the function and regulation of  xxxg1993xxx  are not
very clear thus far. because more than half of all cancer cells possess
dysfunctional p53, it is important to know whether the regulation of
 xxxg1993xxx  in p53-mutated cells might be different than that in p53 wt
cells in response to dna damage stress. according to the results of
tanaka et al. (6),  xxxg1993xxx /hrrm2 could be induced/reduced after 24 h
in response to dna damage in p53 wt cells. however, dna damage
caused by a sublethal dose of uv (20 j/m2) irradiation could be
detected before 8 h in hela cells (49, 50). in p53-mutated cells, the
dna repair process would be delayed, but dna could still be
repaired before 24 h (49 –51). hence, the dramatic increase in  xxxg1993xxx 
and the decrease in hrrm2 after 24 h of ␥-irradiation may be due to
high-dose radiation-related apoptosis and cell death.  xxxg1993xxx  increased
for repair, whereas hrrm2 decreased due to lack of dna replication.
however, our results demonstrated that mrna and protein levels of
both  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrm2 have only changed in response to uv
irradiation when p53 remains intact. this may be due to the sublethal
dose of uv irradiation we used here rather than ␥-irradiation (figs. 2
and 3).
it has been known that p21 and mdm2 could be induced though
up-regulation of p53 transactivation. here we also demonstrated that
the p53 downstream gene, p21 mrna, could be induced after 6 h of

uv irradiation (20 j/m2) in both kb and  xxxg1682xxx  cells (fig. 3, c and d).
of interest, our results seem to suggest that p21 is antagonistic with
hrrm2 and possibly  xxxg1993xxx  induced by uv. our laboratory is currently investigating the detailed mechanism in p21 and cell cycle
regulation. moreover, mdm2 can be induced by 24 h after uv irradiation in kb cells (fig. 1c), which is compatible with decreased p53
at this time point (fig. 3d). this finding is consistent with previous
reports that mdm2 feedback inhibits p53 under uv stress (52, 53). in
addition, our preliminary study noticed that hrrm2 rather than
 xxxg1993xxx  could be induced with h2o2 in kb cells after 24 h (data not
shown). furthermore, western blot results showed that the baseline
expression of  xxxg1993xxx  was not simply based on p53 status (fig. 1, b and
c). therefore, our result suggested that p53 might not be the only
factor involved in transcription regulation of  xxxg1993xxx  in response to
dna damage.
the defect in  xxxg1993xxx  binding to hrrm1 revealed by immunoprecipitation also requires further explanation. one possible explanation
is that mutant p53 is unable to release  xxxg1993xxx , preventing it from
binding hrrm1, as we have shown in our previous study (14). it is
also possible that additional factors affect the ability of  xxxg1993xxx  to bind
to hrrm1 in response to the need for dna repair. it has been
reported that p73, an isoform of the p53 family, plays a role in
inducing  xxxg1993xxx  expression in p53-independent dna repair (21).
furthermore, in the absence of p53, p14afr may act in its place (21).
therefore, the interaction between p14afr and  xxxg1993xxx  may be critical
for response to dna damage. the interaction of  xxxg1993xxx  with p73 and
p14afr requires more study and may suggest that it has functions in
addition to its role in dna repair. taken together, whereas p53 status
clearly affects the ability of  xxxg1993xxx  to respond to the need for dna
repair, the complicated regulation of this activity may involve other
factors associated with cell cycle progression or programmed cell
death, and these need to be taken into consideration. to further
confirm the relationship between p53 status and  xxxg1993xxx  function, we
will transfect p53-null cells with wt p53 expression vectors to confirm
that the observed defects were directly attributable to lack of p53 and
not to some other unidentified defect.
in summary, our results demonstrate that both  xxxg1993xxx  and hrrmr
contribute to dna repair in response to uv is p53 dependent. in the
absence of functional p53,  xxxg1993xxx  is unable to respond, and hrrm2
takes on the entire activity. the inability to induce transcription of
 xxxg1993xxx  in response to uv damage in cells with mutant p53 results in
growth retardation. the additional defect in  xxxg1993xxx  binding to hrrm1
in these cells further interferes with the process of dna repair.
however, expression of hrrm2 can complement this loss and allow
for dna repair in a p53-independent manner. the specific mechanism by which p53 interferes with  xxxg1993xxx -mediated rr activity is not
yet understood. these results suggest that the regulation by p53 or
other upstream regulators of rr is complicated and unique for each
subunit.
