abstract
caffeine, which belongs to the methylxantine family of compounds, is commonly ingested in a range of beverages such as coffee, tea, and
cola drinks. it is also used therapeutically and is frequently employed in the treatment of respiratory disturbances in human neonates. the aim
of the present work has been to examine the ontogeny of the  xxxg81xxx  system in the brainstem of the newborn rat following
postnatal treatment with caffeine to mimic the therapeutic administration of caffeine to premature human infants. the effect of this postnatal
exposure to caffeine on the gradual appearance of adenosine a1 receptors was analysed by determining immunohistochemically the
distribution of the receptors. the main difference between control animals and animals exposed to caffeine was the transient increase (only at
postnatal day 6) in the number of immunopositive neurons in two brainstem areas, the ventrolateral medulla and the rostral dorsolateral pons,
in caffeine-treated rat pups, or more specifically, the parabrachial and kölliker-fuse nuclei, both of which are classically associated with
respiratory control. with previous research highlighting the important role played by the rostral pons in respiratory modulation by the
 xxxg81xxx  system, it is thus possible that postnatal exposure to caffeine modulates the ontogeny of the  xxxg81xxx 
network. this could imply that the role of caffeine to decrease the incidence of neonatal respiratory disturbances may be due to the earlier
than normal development of the adenosinergic system in the brain.

1. introduction
caffeine is one of the most often consumed central
nervous system stimulants. apart from its consumption in
food and beverage products, it is widely used therapeutically
in the neonatal intensive care field in the treatment of
apnoea in premature newborn infants. when used in this
manner, caffeine has been shown to normalize breathing in
the majority of apnoea-affected infants to whom it is given
(comer et al., 2001; steer et al., 2004). during such
treatment, premature infants may be exposed to relatively
high serum concentrations of caffeine (10 – 15 mg/l) for

extended periods of time (up to 8 weeks). in spite of its
therapeutic outcome, the existence of a relation between
exposure to caffeine and the modification of neural
maturation process, particularly with respect to respiratory
control in particular, has not been clearly demonstrated
(guillet and kellogg, 1991; erenberg et al., 2000; comer et
al., 2001; nakamoto, 2004).
over recent years it has become evident that adenosine
plays an important role as a modulator in the central nervous
system (thomas and spyer, 1999; dunwiddie and masino,
2001). it is known that caffeine, as well as theophylline and
paraxanthine, binds to the a1, a2a and a2b adenosine
receptors, and should therefore act by antagonizing the
actions of endogenous adenosine (daly and fredholm,
2004; fredholm et al., 2005; mayer et al., 2006). thus,
the acute effects of these compounds are in contrast with

340

s.p. gaytan et al. / autonomic neuroscience: basic and clinical 126 – 127 (2006) 339 – 346

those of adenosine due to their higher competitive binding
to the adenosine receptors (daly and fredholm, 2004;
nakamoto, 2004; saadani-makki et al., 2004).
the role of adenosine a1 receptors in respiratory control
has been studied in depth (runold et al., 1986; bissonnette
et al., 1991; schmidt et al., 1995; weaver, 1996; herlenius
et al., 1997, 2002; koos et al., 2001; daly and fredholm,
2004). the adenosine a1 receptors are known to be widely
distributed in the brain, in particular in the brainstem
(herlenius et al., 1997, 2002), having been identified in
many of the areas that are related to the respiratory
network, such as the ventral respiratory group (vrg) and
the pontine respiratory area (medial parabrachial and
kölliker-fuse nuclei (mpb/kf) (bianchi et al., 1995;
gaytán and pásaro, 1998; bodineau and larnicol, 2001;
bodineau et al., 2003; hilaire and pásaro, 2003; saadanimakki et al., 2004).
during development, at least in the rat, but perhaps in
other mammals including humans, the appearance of the
adenosine a1 receptors is gradual and regionally specific.
in rats, while the adult density of adenosine a1 receptors
is attained at about 24 days postnatal in the cerebellum
and by one month in the cortex (marangos et al., 1984;
marangos, 1984; weaver, 1996), no conclusive results
have yet been reported concerning the time course of the
appearance of these receptors in the brainstem. on the
other hand, it is known that  xxxg81xxx 
expression is up-regulated in certain brain areas in adult
rats when caffeine is administered chronically and also in
newborn rats exposed to caffeine in utero (marangos,
1984; bodineau et al., 2003; saadani-makki et al., 2004).
relatively few studies have examined the effects of
pharmacological therapies prescribed for human newborns or
to pregnant women in the immediate perinatal period (guillet,
1990, 1995; erenberg et al., 2000; comer et al., 2001). the
presence of multiple variables limits the extent of our
understanding given the need for investigation on the neonates
themselves. using rats, a nonprecocial species, it is possible to
model to a limited extent the process of development of the
human brain in the third trimester of gestation.
in relation to the above outline of the literature, the goal
of the present study has been to use an animal model to
mimic clinical exposure to caffeine in the premature
neonate (guillet, 1990, 1995; guillet and kellogg, 1991;
fisher and guillet, 1997). more specifically, our aim has
been to investigate the possible effects of caffeine on the
ontogeny of the adenosine a 1 receptor within the
respiratory network and to determine whether changes in
 xxxg81xxx  systems might underlie previously described
changes in respiratory physiology (erenberg et al., 2000;
comer et al., 2001; millar and schmidt, 2004; steer et al.,
2004). immunohistochemistry has been employed in the
present experiments for detection of adenosine a1 receptors in the brainstem after postnatal administration of
caffeine, with a dose protocol established to achieve serum
caffeine levels comparable to those reached in the

premature infant (guillet, 1990, 1995; guillet and kellogg,
1991).

2. materials and methods
the experimental protocols described here were carried
out in accordance with the european communities council
directive (86/609/eec) and were approved by the animal
ethics committee of the university of seville. pregnant
sprague dawley rats were divided into control (n = 4 rats)
and caffeine (n = 5 rats) groups. the day on which pups
were born was considered to be postnatal day 0 (p0). pups
received caffeine plus glucose (n = 26) or water plus
glucose (n = 25) by gavage on days 2– 6 of life, in a
volume of 0.05 ml/10 g body weight. to maintain serum
levels of caffeine at 5– 15 mg/l (approximately 0.26– 0.77
mm range) over the 24 h of each day, the pups received
caffeine 20 mg/kg on day 2 and 15 mg/kg on days 3– 6
(guillet and kellogg, 1991). the pups were left undisturbed except for routine care, gavage and weighing.
after the treatment period, animals were deeply anesthetized by ether inhalation and then perfused transcardially
with 4% formalin in 0.1 m phosphate buffered saline (pbs,
ph 7.4). brains were removed, weighed and sectioned at 20
am in the coronal or longitudinal planes using a freezing
cryostat (leica cryostat cm 1850) at 25 -c, and then
mounted on gelatine-coated slides and air dried.
all sections were pre-treated with pbs, triton x-100
(0.3%) and normal donkey serum (1%; jackson immunoresearch lab. inc., baltimore, ma, usa), washed with pbs
and incubated for 72 h at 4 -c with adenosine a1-r goat
polyclonal igg primary antibody (1:500, santacruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa) diluted in pbs and
triton x-100 (0.3%). after washing with pbs, each section
was covered with one drop of fluorescein-conjugated
affinity-purified anti-goat igg (donkey; 1:500, jackson
immunoresearch lab. inc., usa) secondary antibody and
incubated for 4 h at room temperature, then mounted and
coverslipped (vectashield; vector laboratories inc. burlingame, ca, usa).
coronal and longitudinal sections were analyzed with
the aid of an olympus bx61 microscope (olympus,
tokyo, japan) and immunopositive cells in each section
were counted. neurons were considered immunopositive
for  xxxg81xxx  when the cytoplasm of the cell
contained green fluorescent dots (see figs. 1b,d, 2b,d,
and 3b,d). the number of  xxxg81xxx -labelled cells was
counted over the entire rostrocaudal extent of the pons
and medulla, and charted onto outline diagrams of the
sections modified from the paxinos and watson (1986)
atlas. the counting was performed in brain regions
referenced by paxinos and watson (1986) atlas, taking
the same reference points in the rostrocaudal extension
for all animals. the data were analysed as follows: first,
the assumption of normality was checked by the

development, a sample of 2% of labelled cells was
selected to count the number of labelled dots within their
somata and proximal dendrites (minor standard error 0.1,
85% confidence). for all tests, statistical significance was
taken at p  0.05. epifluorescence photomicrographs were
recorded with a coupled 1.5 mpixels colour ccd camera
(dp70, olympus, japan). images were stored as tiff files
with lzw compression and 1360  1024 pixel resolution.

3. results
 xxxg81xxx -labelled neurons were evident
over the entire rostrocaudal extent of the medulla and pons
from p0 to p21 in control animals, and particularly within
several nuclei involved in respiratory control. at the level of
the medulla,  xxxg81xxx -immunopositive areas included the
ventrolateral and central subnuclei of the nucleus of the
solitary tract, area postrema, raphe obscurus, the rostroventrolateral (rvl) and caudoventrolateral (cvl) reticular
nuclei, the ambiguus nucleus (amb) and its surrounding
reticular formation (rostral and caudal vrg), the prebötzinger and bötzinger complexes (pre-bc/bc), the
perifacial area, and the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus
(lpgi). at the level of the pons, immunopositive regions
included the a5 area, the locus coeruleus (lc), and the
mpb/kf and lateral parabrachial (lpb) nuclei (fig. 4).
the number of immunopositive neurons in caffeinetreated pups was no different to that of control pups from

p0 to p5 (fig. 4), with a very low number of adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  immunopositive neurons (0 – 4 immunopositive cells per labelled nuclei) from p0 to p2 (fig. 4) in
both control and caffeine-treated pups.
in caffeine-treated pups, a significant increase in the
number of  xxxg81xxx -labelled neurons was only
found in several respiration-related nuclei at p6: at the
medullary level these were the rvl and cvl nuclei, the
perifacial area, lpgi, amb/vrg and pre-bc/bc, while at
the pontine level the mpb/kf and lpb nuclei showed
labelling. in this way, the mean number of labelled neurons
within the lpgi was 3.82 t 2.57 in control animals and
15.71 t 8.49 in the caffeine-treated group, while for the
mpb/kf the mean number of labelled neurons was
7.29 t 6.99 in control animals and 31.40 t 6.81 in the
caffeine-treated group (figs. 2 and 4).
the differences between control and caffeine-treated
groups in terms of the number of labelled neurons within
the mentioned nuclei were no longer evident at postnatal
day p8 (figs. 3 and 4). from p8 to p21, similar numbers
of  xxxg81xxx -labelled neurons were present in
the respective nuclei of control and caffeine-treated rats
(fig. 4).
the cell bodies of  xxxg81xxx -labelled neurons
in both control and caffeine-treated pups exhibited a range of
different sizes and shapes, depending on their location. in the
ventral medulla (amb/vrg and cvl/rvl), cell bodies
were multipolar in shape and of medium size (mean long
diameter 10.01 t1.09 am). the cell bodies of mpb neurons

could be classified into two categories: medium-sized and
multipolar (long diameter 8.92 t 1.92 am), and small and
round-shaped (long diameter 8.31 t 0.87 am). kf neurons
showed medium-sized, multipolar cell bodies (long diameter
15.98 t 2.31 am).
counts of immunolabelled-dots inside labelled cells to
determine the intensity of the expression of labelled
receptors showed two patterns of labelling. first, the
mean number of labelled dots within neuronal cell bodies
and processes did not change over the duration of the
postnatal development (from p0 to p21) and was not
different for control and caffeine-treated groups in some
areas related to respiratory control (i.e. the nucleus of the
solitary tract) (table 1). second, in some of the
respiration-related areas exhibiting labelling, the mean
number of labelled dots inside neurons of the caffeinetreated group increased at p6, with a similar increase
occurring two days later at p8 to p21 in the control
group. for example, a slight increase in the mean number
of positively labelled dots was found in the mpb/kf,
lpgi, and lc labelled neurons at p6 in caffeine-treated
animals compared to control (table 1).

4. discussion
apnoea in the premature human newborn is a common
condition when birth takes place at less than 37 weeks of
gestational age (erenberg et al., 2000; comer et al.,
2001). it is assumed that caffeine citrate administered
either intravenously or, usually, orally is a safe and
effective treatment for apnoea in premature infants at 28–
32 weeks gestational age. in this way, it has been shown
that methylxanthines reduce the frequency of idiopathic
apnoea and the need for mechanical ventilation by acting
as non-specific inhibitors of adenosine a1 and a2a
receptors (erenberg et al., 2000; comer et al., 2001;
millar and schmidt, 2004; mayer et al., 2006; steer et al.,
2004). however, more studies are necessary to determine
the safety of this therapy in very preterm infants. for this
reason, the goal of the present study has been to use an
animal model to mimic clinical exposure to caffeine in
the premature neonate (guillet, 1990, 1995; guillet and
kellogg, 1991; etzel and guillet, 1994; nakamoto, 2004)
with the aim to investigate possible effects of caffeine on
the ontogeny of the  xxxg81xxx  and to

determine whether changes in the  xxxg81xxx  system
might underlie previously described respiratory changes.
it has been shown that a marked increase of
adenosinergic receptors in the developing brain takes
place in the first weeks of extrauterine life and that a
limited exposure of neonatal rats (14 – 31 days of age) to
caffeine altered the development of adenosine receptors in
the thalamus and cerebellum (fuller et al., 1982; guillet
and kellogg, 1991; etzel and guillet, 1994; fisher and
guillet, 1997; nakamoto, 2004). these studies, as well as
the present report, indicate that even a limited exposure to
caffeine in the early neonatal period may thereafter
influence different neuronal networks (fisher and guillet,
1997; nakamoto, 2004).
respiration is strongly modulated by adenosinergic
action at the level of the medulla and pons (bodineau et
al., 2003; saadani-makki et al., 2004). the results of the
present study are consistent with previous reports relating
the adenosinergic  xxxg81xxx  system to the control of
respiration (runold et al., 1986; schmidt et al., 1995;
bodineau et al., 2003; saadani-makki et al., 2004).
indeed, these latter studies have shown that adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  activation induced a significant decrease in
respiratory frequency in medullary-spinal cord and caudal
pontomedullary-spinal cord in vitro preparations. in
contrast, in the presence of the rostral pons, a significant
increase frequency of respiration was observed. moreover,
c-fos expression, in respiration-related nuclei, evoked by
application of the metabolically stable adenosine a1
receptor agonist, n 6 -(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine,
r( )isomer (r-pia, sigma aldrich, france), diverged
depending on the presence or absence of the rostral pons.
indeed, in the present report the largest change in the
mean number of  xxxg81xxx -labelled neurons
after the treatment with caffeine was found within the
mpb/kf in the rostral pons. in previous reports (bodineau et al., 2003; saadani-makki et al., 2004) concerning
pontomedullary-spinal cord preparations, the increase in the
respiratory frequency observed in conjunction with the
adenosinergic a1 system activation seemed to depend on the
presence of the rostral part of the pons. taken together, the
previous reports and the findings in the present study, point
to the fact that postnatal caffeine exposure leads to an
increase in the effects of the adenosinergic a1 system in
respiratory control.
in the present report, it is shown that development of
the adenosinergic system has a time window around the
postnatal day 6, especially in relation to several nuclei
associated with respiration. postnatal caffeine exposure led
to the premature expression of adenosine a1 receptors,
thereby affecting the number of neurons that expressed
this subtype of receptor, and the subcellullar density of the
receptor. this data is in agreement with previous findings
in which the adenosinergic system was studied (rebola et
al., 2003; nakamoto, 2004). furthermore, the finding that
the main increase in the number of labelled neurons was

found in the pbm/kf on p6 highlights the fact that the
rostral pons could play a critical role in the development
of the adenosinergic system. indeed, in the study by
saadani-makki et al. (2004), the mpb was the only
structure at the pontine level that showed an increase in cfos expression after r-pia application. upon treatment
with caffeine in the perinatal period, the activation of
mpb could be mediated by adenosine a1 receptors and be
related to the clinical effects observed in neonates after
caffeine treatment.
caffeine exposure may also exert a critical influence
on the developing human brain, a possibility that may be
of particular importance since caffeine is used to treat
apnoea in premature human neonates (fisher and guillet,
1997; nakamoto, 2004). the present results indicate that
the positive effect observed in the clinical use of caffeine
could be related to the up-regulation of adenosine a1
receptor expression. however, we showed here that after
caffeine exposure, the expression of a1 adenosinergic
receptors was maintained constant until the juvenile age
(p21). in relation at least to the neuronal network related
to respiratory function, no difference with respect to
control was observed in the caffeine-treated group after
p6. nevertheless, the long-term effects of postnatal
caffeine exposure probably also affect other neuronal
networks related or not to respiratory control (etzel and
guillet, 1994; fisher and guillet, 1997; guillet, 1995).
many diseases in the later years of human life are
believed to originate in early foetal life (nakamoto, 2004).
if this is so, it would not be surprising to learn that
caffeine exposure in early life is responsible for diseases
and/or behaviours of which we are currently unaware
(nehlig et al., 1992; nehlig and debry, 1994). a range of
animal studies has shown permanent changes long after
caffeine exposure had ended. indeed, sudden infant death
syndrome could possibly be related to heavy maternal
caffeine consumption (daly and fredholm, 2004; nakamoto, 2004). extrapolation of these studies to humans
may suggest the possibility that differences in the
ontogeny of adenosine a1 receptors may occur at critical
developmental times and thus affect various responses,
systems, sequences, etc. that may be crucial for subsequent normal development (brockhaus and ballanyi,
2000; millar and schmidt, 2004). many aspects of
development depend on proper sequencing such that the
alteration of one step in the sequence may have farreaching implications (guillet, 1990, 1995; guillet and
kellogg, 1991; león et al., 2002). in this way, some
studies have reported an increase in the number and/or
sensitivity of adenosine a1 receptors in the central nervous
system after chronic exposure to caffeine in adults
(marangos, 1984; daly and fredholm, 2004; fredholm
et al., 2005). as such, up-regulation and, perhaps,
acceleration of the development of a1 receptors would

5. conclusions
findings presented in the current work favour the
involvement of the adenosinergic a1 system in the interaction
of caffeine and respiratory drive during the postnatal period.
these results showed that such an interaction involves upregulation of the number of adenosine a1 receptors. indeed,
given that caffeine competitively binds to the adenosine site
in the  xxxg81xxx , the organism tends to increase
the receptor number to maintain the efficacy of the
adenosinergic a1 system. furthermore, p6 in the rat is a
critical time point in the development of the adenosinergic a1
system. since the potential exists for the alteration of
development as a result of early treatment with the drug, all
such therapeutic agents should be used with care in human
neonates.
