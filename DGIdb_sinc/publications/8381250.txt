 xxxd2175xxx  regulates rat osteoblast expression of
osteocalcin protein and mrna levels
peter t. guidon jr.,' roberto salvatori,',' and richard s. bockman1.2

abstract
 xxxd2175xxx , a group iiia metal salt, has been found to be clinically effective for the treatment of accelerated bone resorption in cancer-related hypercalcemia and paget's disease. here we report the effects of  xxxd2175xxx  on osteocalcin mrna and protein levels on the rat osteoblast-like cell line ros 17/2.8. gallium
nitrate reduced both constitutive and vitamin d,-stimulated osteocalcin protein levels in culture medium by
one-half and osteocalcin mrna levels to one-third to one-tenth of control.  xxxd2175xxx  also inhibited
vitamin d, stimulation of osteocalcin and osteopontin mrna levels but did not affect constitutive osteopontin mrna levels. among several different metals examined, gallium was unique in its ability to reduce
osteocalcin mrna levels without decreasing levels of other mrnas synthesized by ros 17/2.8 cells. the effects of  xxxd2175xxx  on osteocalcin mrna and protein synthesis mimic those seen when ros 17/2.8 cells
are exposed to transforming growth factor p1 (tgf&); however, tgf-0, was not detected in gallium nitratetreated ros 17/2.8 cell media. use of the rna polymerase i1 inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-l-~-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole demonstrated that  xxxd2175xxx  did not alter the stability of osteocalcin mrna. transient
transfection assays using the rat osteocalcin promoter linked to the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase indicated that  xxxd2175xxx  blocked reporter gene expression stimulated by the osteocalcin promoter. this is the first reported effect of  xxxd2175xxx  on isolated osteoblast cells.

lium nitrate has proven to be very effective in rapidly
blocking bone resorption, ( 2 4 - 2 7 ) most probably by acting
directly on osteoclasts to inhibit their resorptive activity.(2a.29)
the possibility that gallium may have direct effects on other cells involved in bone metabolism, such as
the osteoblast, has not been addressed to date.
we report here that treatment of the rat osteoblast-like
cell line ros 17/2.8 with noncytotoxic levels of  xxxd2175xxx  results in a dose-dependent reduction in constitutive
oc mrna levels. gallium also suppresses vitamin d,
stimulation of oc and osteopontin mrna levels but does
not alter the constitutive expression of osteopontin. the
reduction in oc mrna levels caused by  xxxd2175xxx 
treatment appears to be mediated via a reduction in gene
expression rather than an effect on oc mrna stability.
we discuss models that may explain the inhibition of constitutive and vitamin d,-stimulated oc gene expression by
gallium, as well as the possible significance of the reduced
synthesis of oc as a mechanism by which this pharmacologic agent may preserve bone mass by retarding bone resorptive processes.

examined for changes in constitutive oc mrna levels. of
the 10 elements tested, only gallium caused a dramatic reduction in oc mrna levels without decreasing either pc
or o p levels (fig. 2). strontium also decreased oc mrna
levels but also decreased pc levels. aluminum, a lighter

but a heavier group iiia metal, indium, drastically reduced
all three relative to  xxxg861xxx . zinc reduced pc and oc

 xxxd2175xxx  mimics the tgf-0, effect on

the inhibition of oc protein and mrna synthesis by
 xxxd2175xxx  mimicked the activity previously demonstrated in ros 17/2.8 cells by the pleiotropic cytokine
tgf-&.(3) ros 17/2.8 cells, like nontransformed osteoblasts, are capable of synthesizing tgf-6,. (‘o) t o determine whether the inhibition of oc mrna synthesis was
due to biologically active tgf-pi endogenously produced
by ros 17/2.8 cells in response to  xxxd2175xxx  treatment, media from  xxxd2175xxx - or tgf-&-treated ros
17/2.8 cells was collected at various intervals after addition
of effectors and added to the mink lung epithelial cell line
mv,lu. as seen in fig. 3a, media from gallium nitratetreated cells did not inhibit dna synthesis compared to
media from untreated ros 17/2.8 cells. as controls, media from tgf-&-treated ros 17/2.8 cells showed a 95%
decrease in dna synthesis.  xxxd2175xxx  added directly
to mv,lu cells did not interfere with the ability of exogenously added tgf-pi to inhibit mv,lu dna synthesis
(fig. 3b). these results suggest that  xxxd2175xxx  did not
stimulate the production or release of extracellular tgf-pi
by ros 17/2.8 cells.

molecular mechanisms involved in oc mrna

previous studies have shown that oc mrna levels are
regulated positively by vitamin d3i6’or negatively by tgfpic3)at the transcriptional level and at the level of mrna
stability by  xxxg1885xxx . ( i )to determine whether
reduction in oc mrna levels by  xxxd2175xxx  is due to a
decrease in oc mrna half-life or inhibition of rat oc
gene transcription, untreated plates of ros 17/2.8 cells
were compared to those treated with 75 pm  xxxd2175xxx . the rna polymerase i1 inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-l-/3d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole(drb, 25 pg/ml), (‘i) was
added 12 h later, to all cell monolayers. total rna was
isolated from cells 0, 12, and 24 h after drb addition and
examined for oc mrna levels. the rates of oc mrna
decay in either the absence or presence of  xxxd2175xxx 
after addition of drb was identical (fig. 4; note parallel
lines), indicating that  xxxd2175xxx  does not affect oc
mrna stability.

treatment reduced constitutive cat activity from the oc

no effect on expression of a rous sarcoma virus-cat construct that was transiently transfected into ros 17/2.8

suggest that the rat oc promoter contains a sequence(s) responsible for mediating the inhibitory effects of  xxxd2175xxx .

 xxxd2175xxx  effect on oc protein levels
to determine whether the decreased amounts of o c

cells translated into a decreased amount of oc protein
produced, confluent ros 1 7 / 2 3 cells were exposed to 75

96 h. conditioned media were collected and assayed for
o c protein using a radioimmunoassay (table 1). vitamin

consistent with previous s t u d i e ~ . " ~ )ros 17/2.8 cells
treated with  xxxd2175xxx  showed a 60% reduction in
constitutive oc protein levels. furthermore,  xxxd2175xxx  also was able to inhibit vitamin d,-stimulated o c

the data presented showed that  xxxd2175xxx , a group
iiia metal salt, inhibited both constitutive and vitamin d,induced expression of the rat o c gene in the osteoblastlike osteosarcoma cell line ros 17/2.8. among several related metals examined, only gallium inhibited o c gene expression without affecting the mrna levels of other matrix proteins. gallium did not destabilize o c mrna but,
rather, seemed to suppress oc gene promoter activity.
gallium treatment mimicked the reported effects of tgf0,on o c gene transcription. tgf-0, is produced by ros
17/2.8 cells,(4o)but gallium treatment did not induce the
synthesis or release of extracellular biologically active
tgf-0, from ros 17/2.8 cells because media from gallium-treated ros cells did not inhibit dna synthesis of
the mink lung epithelial cell line.
gallium also inhibited the vitamin d,-stimulated expression of the o c and op genes, which raises the possibility
that gallium may have affected intracellular signaling pathways required for vitamin d,-mediated stimulation of gene
expression. there are known response elements within the
o c promoter region that affect oc gene expression. for
example, glucocorticoids inhibit constitutive and vitamin
dp stimulation of oc gene expression through a dna sequence that is proximal to the vitamin d, response element
(vdre) in the human o c gene.") glucocorticoids also
decreased vitamin d, receptor gene expression and vitamin
d, receptor number in human mg-63 osteogenic sarcoma
cells. ( 4 4 )
the rat o c gene promoter has been extensively characterized by several groups. (38.45-48) a region in the rat oc
promoter(49)that is homologous to a sequence in the human o c promoter'" has been reported t o influence tissuespecific constitutive oc gene expression. this dna region
has been identified as the "oc box."(4.49)the rat oc
promoter also contains a vdre.i38,45-'8)both the o c box
and the vdre in the rat o c promoter are overlapped by a
sequence to which purified components of the transcription factor, activator protein 1 (ap-1), can bind.(49)the
ap-1 binding site is a highly conserved motif that can interact with (be bound by) protein heterodimers encoded by
the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes and related gene produ c t ~ . in( an

~ ~ ~ ~to explain the reciprocal relationship between cell proliferation and differential gene expression, a model called phenotype suppression has been proposed.(49) in this model, proliferating, nontransformed

resorption of control bone. a correlation between decreased amounts of o c and decreased bone resorption was
also seen in the bones from three osteopetrotic rat
strains.(sn1these results suggest that bone matrix-bound
o c may have a critical role in long bone modeling.
the effects of growth factors and hormones on bone
metabolism in vivo are complex. in cell culture systems,
however, it has been shown that growth factors and metabolic bone cell effectors, such as  xxxd1682xxx (6)
and  xxxg1885xxx ,(8)that stimulate resorptive processes increase o c levels, and at least one growth factor that promotes net bone formation, tgf-pl, ( 5 9 ) decreases o c synthesis. t 3 ) the observation that  xxxd2175xxx  decreases
o c production in an osteoblast cell line is consistent with
the hypothesis that reduced synthesis of oc could have an
important long-term antiresorptive effect that may lead to
the preservation of total bone mass. this effect of gallium
on oc gene expression makes gallium unique among the
clinically available antiresorptive drugs. a potential mechanism by which gallium ultimately affects bone metabolism may be elucidated through a better understanding of
the biologic function of o c in bone formation and remodeling.
