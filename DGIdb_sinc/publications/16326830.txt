abstract
tamoxifen acts as an oestrogen antagonist in the breast reducing cell proliferation, but in the uterus as an oestrogen
agonist resulting in increased cell proliferation. tamoxifen exerts its tissue-specific effects through the oestrogen
receptors (er or er). the levels and functions of the two ers affect the response of the target tissue to oestrogen and
tamoxifen. we examined the control of er stability in breast and uterine cell lines using western blotting and rt-pcr.
in mcf-7 breast-derived cells, er and er proteins were rapidly degraded via the proteasome pathway in response
to  xxxd2037xxx ; conversely tamoxifen stabilised both receptors. in ishikawa uterine-derived cells,  xxxd2037xxx  and
tamoxifen stabilised er but led to degradation of er by the proteasome pathway. further investigations showed
that  xxxd2037xxx  induced activation of the non-genomic er/akt signalling pathway in mcf-7 cells. we have
demonstrated that the alternative erk signalling pathway is activated in ishikawa cells following  xxxd2037xxx  treatment in
the absence of an active proteasome pathway and therefore increased levels of er. in conclusion, our data have
demonstrated tamoxifen or  xxxd2037xxx  control of er subtype stability and that non-genomic activation of transcription
pathways is cell specific.

introduction
tamoxifen is widely used for the adjuvant treatment of
breast cancer, although epidemiological evidence has
shown an increase in endometrial cancers in treated
women (rutqvist et al. 1995, fotiou et al. 2000, kloos
et al. 2002). in the breast, tamoxifen acts as an oestrogen
antagonist, reducing or preventing the proliferation of
 xxxg730xxx  (er)-positive tumour cells (cuzick
et al. 2003, power & thompson 2003). however, in the
uterus, tamoxifen acts as an oestrogen agonist resulting
in cell proliferation (goldstein 2001, pole et al. 2005).
tamoxifen and other selective er modulators
(serms) exert their tissue-specific eﬀects through
interaction with one or both of the ers (er or er)
(mcdonnell et al. 2002, park & jordan 2002). in the
classical pathway for er activation, ligand binding
causes the receptors to undergo conformational changes
and dimerise forming homo- or heterodimers, which
bind to the palindromic oestrogen response element
(ere), leading to recruitment of coactivator proteins
and transcription of oestrogen responsive genes

(edwards 2000, klinge 2001). recent studies have
reported the importance of cell membrane-associated
er (kelly & levin 2001) in the activation of cytoplasmic
signalling cascades, although there are considerably
fewer membrane than nuclear receptors (razandi et al.
1999). rapid non-genomic signalling through pathways
involving phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (pi3k)/akt or
 xxxg1369xxx / xxxg1366xxx , leading to the transcription of target genes,
has been described (pedram et al. 2002, song et al. 2002),
suggesting that some of the proliferative eﬀects of
 xxxd2037xxx  may be mediated through these mitogenic
pathways. this non-genomic eﬀect of oestrogens has
added to the broad range of transcriptional responses
that can be produced by ligand-bound er in diﬀerent
cell types.
control of er protein levels has been studied within
various cell types and it is now generally accepted that
this protein is targeted for rapid degradation via the
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in response to  xxxd2037xxx 
in breast cancer cells (dowsett & ashworth 2003). the
control and degradation pathways for er remain
unclear and as yet there is not a universally accepted

er regulation is cell type specific

mechanism for the control of levels of either er or
er in uterine cells. er and er proteins may be
degraded diﬀerentially in breast and uterine cells in
response to  xxxd2037xxx  and tamoxifen, thus providing
some mechanistic evidence for the diverse response of
these tissues. there is evidence to suggest that the activity
of the proteasome pathway controlling er degradation
in mcf-7 cells is directly linked to activation of
transcription through the ere (reid et al. 2003).
if the magnitude of transcriptional activity within cells
is directly related to the cellular concentration of the er,
regulatory mechanisms controlling er protein levels
could alter its transcriptional output. in this paper we
explore the activation of alternative mitogenic nongenomic signalling pathways. further aims of this study
were to establish previously undefined mechanisms for
er degradation in the mcf-7 cell type. comparisons
were made with er and er protein degradation in
the uterine adenocarcinoma-derived ishikawa cell line.
the diﬀerential eﬀect of  xxxd2037xxx  or tamoxifen on
er protein levels and subsequent activation of the
non-genomic signalling pathways was investigated.

materials and methods
human cell culture

human breast adenocarcinoma-derived mcf-7 cells
(ecacc, salisbury, wiltshire, uk; were maintained
in dulbecco’s modified eagles’ media (dmem)/f12
(invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamax
(invitrogen) and 10% foetal calf serum (fcs; invitrogen). human uterine epithelial carcinoma-derived
ishikawa cells (ecacc) were maintained in rpmi-1640
media (invitrogen) supplemented as described above.
for visualisation of er by western blotting, ishikawa
cells were transfected with an er expression construct
as described previously (jones et al.1999) prior to
treatment. all media were phenol red free and cell
cultures were maintained in media containing 10%
dextran-coated charcoal-stripped (dcst) fcs for 72 h
before dosing, to ensure depletion of hormones and
growth factors in the calf serum.

phosphorylation of akt) and the ishikawa cells were
treated with 30µm  xxxd1169xxx  (santa cruz biotechnologies, santa cruz, ca, usa) in combination with e2
for inhibition of mek phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. cells
were washed with phosphate-buﬀered saline (pbs) and
lysed in ice-cold protein extraction buﬀer (song et al.
2002). for preliminary analysis of er cellular localisation, nuclear and cytosolic fractions were produced
using cells grown in culture media supplemented as
above for 72 h and prepared with the ne-per nuclear
and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit (pierce, perbio
science, northumberland, uk) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. protein concentration was
determined using the bca protein assay kit (sigma) and
measured using a bmg fluorostar plate reader (bmg
lab technologies, oﬀenburg, germany) at 540 nm.
proteins were analysed by page (7·5% gels) and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (amersham
pharmacia biotech, amersham, bucks, uk). positive
controls for antibody specificity were 10 ng recombinant
protein (rher and rher; calbiochem, nottingham,
uk). membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) non-fat
milk in 0·1% pbs tween-20 for 12–18 h. er protein
was detected with h-184 rabbit polyclonal antibody
(santa cruz biotechnologies) and er with 06–629
rabbit polyclonal antibody (upstate biotechnologies,
dundee, uk) or gr-39 mouse monoclonal (oncogene).
akt protein was detected with sc-5289 mouse
monoclonal (santa cruz biotechnologies) and phosphorylated akt (pakt) with 92715 rabbit polyclonal
(cell signaling, hertfordshire, uk). western blots were
re-probed with antibody to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) protein (biogenesis ltd, poole,
uk). hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
secondary antibodies (santa cruz biotechnologies) and
the pierce super signal chemiluminescence detection
system were used to visualise immunoreactivity. data
were collected using a syngene (cambridge, cambs,
uk) genegnome gel documentation system and protein
expression was normalised to  xxxg861xxx  levels. statistical
analysis of variance (anova) or two sample t-tests were
performed where appropriate (pc0·05).

confocal microscopy

mcf-7 or ishikawa cells were grown for 72 h in
four-well glass chamber slides in culture medium
supplemented with charcoal-stripped serum as detailed
above. cells were pretreated with mg115 (10 6 m) for
1 h before dosing with e2 (108 m), tam (106 m) or
ethanol vehicle (control) for 3 h. cells were fixed for
30 min in methanol at 20 c, washed in pbs and
permeabilised with 0·4% triton x-100 10 min before
blocking with 2% normal goat serum/4% bsa for
30 min at 37 c. primary mouse monoclonal antibodies
were incubated at 4 c overnight. er was detected
with santa cruz biotechnologies d12 at 1:20 dilution in
blocking buﬀer and er with serotec (oxford, uk)
mca1973s at 1:20 dilution also in blocking buﬀer.
secondary antibody was alexafluor 488 (molecular
probes, eugene, or, usa) at 1:500 in blocking buﬀer,
incubated at 4 c overnight in darkness. hoechst 33342
dye was subsequently added for nuclear staining.
confocal microscopic images were captured using a
zeiss lsm 510 meta multi-photon confocal microscope (carl zeiss (uk) ltd, welwyn garden city, herts,
uk). low magnification z-series were collected with a
20 plan-neofluar lens and high resolution series using
a 401·3 oil immersion plan-apocromat lens or a 63
c-apochromat 1·2 na water immersion lens. threedimensional reconstructions of each data set were
performed to examine each confocal z-series using zeiss
advanced imaging microscopy (carl zeiss ltd). nuclear
staining was performed using  xxxd2284xxx  (10µg/ml;
molecular probes) in pbs for 10 min and excited in
multi photon mode with a tsuanmi infra red laser
(spectra physics, mountain view, ca, usa) at 760 nm
and detected with a 365–405 nm band pass filter.
alexafluor 488-labelled secondary antibody (molecular
probes) was excited with a 488 nm argon laser line
(lasos lastertechnik gmbh, germany) and detected
using a long pass 505 nm filter.
mrna extraction and rt-pcr

mcf-7 and ishikawa cells were counted before lysis and
mrna extraction by oligo dt-linked dynabeads (dynal,
biotech ltd, wirral, uk) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. dynabead-linked mrna was used
as a template for reverse transcription at 42 c for 1 h
(promega reagents). hot-start pcr performed with
 xxxg861xxx  was a control (hall et al. 1998). pcr primer
sequences for er and er have been described
previously (tschugguel et al. 2003). data were collected
using a syngene genegnome gel documentation system
and expression was normalised to  xxxg861xxx  levels.

the peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor
mg115 has previously been demonstrated to have a role
in apoptosis (lopes et al. 1997). the toxicity of mg115
was therefore assessed by a trypan blue exclusion assay
in mcf-7 and ishikawa cells. the viability of both cell
types remained unaﬀected after 1-h pretreatment with
mg115, and lysis after 3-h incubation with e2 or tam
(fig. 3a and b). to assess the eﬃcacy of proteasome
pathway inhibitors, the eﬀects of mg115, mg132 or
lactacystin on proteasome activity in mcf-7 cells were
determined by a fluorescence assay based on the
hydrolysis of a peptide substrate (suc-llvy-amc) for
the proteasome complex (nandi et al. 1997, kisselev et al.
1999). results showed that mg115 is as eﬃcient as
others, alone or in combination (fig. 3c). to address
the observation that the peptide was still subject to
degradation even in the presence of the proteasome
inhibitors, the cells were treated with a cocktail of
protease inhibitors, in combination with the mg115
proteasome inhibitor. in this additional experiment, full
inhibition was achieved suggesting that this peptide is
also a target for the protease pathway.
the eﬀect of e2 or tam on er protein levels was
assessed in mcf-7 and ishikawa cells. er protein
levels were reduced in mcf-7 cells dosed for 3 h with e2
(fig. 4a). pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor
mg115 for 1 h before dosing with e2 abolished this
eﬀect and led to an increase of protein above control
level. it is interesting to note that mg115 treatment
alone led to significant stabilisation of the er protein
(pc0·05; fig. 4a). as er contains a pest (rich in
proline, glutamate and aspartate, serine and threonine)
sequence (pakdel et al. 1993) which is recognised by
proteases including calpains, we pretreated the cells with
2s,3s-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane
ethyl ester e-64-d ( xxxg344xxx ) in place of mg115.
in this experiment, e2-induced degradation of er was
still observed, eliminating the calpain protease as a
possible degradation pathway (data not shown). ishikawa
cell lysates did not show any reduction in er levels
following e2 treatment compared with control (fig. 4b)
and treatment of the cells with mg115 alone did not
lead to a significant increase in er protein levels.
western blot analysis of mcf-7 and ishikawa cell lysates
dosed for 3 h with tam did not show a decrease of er
protein in either case (fig. 4a and b).
tamoxifen-induced degradation of er is also cell
type specific

mcf-7 cells, after 3 h exposure to e2, showed significant
rapid degradation of er protein (pc0·05; fig. 4c).
when cells were pretreated with mg115, levels of er
remained similar to those of control cells. in the
ishikawa cells, reduction in er protein was also
observed in response to e2 treatment; pretreatment of

assessed in both cell lines. in mcf-7 cells, treatment
with tam led to an increase of er protein suggesting
that, as with er, this compound may stabilise the
receptor (fig. 4c). western blot analysis of tam-treated
ishikawa cells showed a loss of er protein;
pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor resulted in
an increase of er protein above control level (fig. 4d).
confocal microscopy

immunocytochemical detection of er and er by
confocal microscopy in the mcf-7 cells demonstrated
that er was detectable primarily in the nucleus, as
indicated by hoechst staining; there was also cytoplasmic
localisation of the protein. er was also located predominantly in the nucleus (fig. 5a, b and inset). however, in
the ishikawa cells, er was detected principally in the
cytoplasm while er was located mainly in the nucleus
(fig. 5c and d). treatment of mcf-7 cells with mg115
alone (fig. 5f) resulted in a greater nuclear er immunoreactivity relative to vehicle-treated controls (fig. 5e).
treatment with e2 (fig. 5 g) resulted in loss of er signal
relative to controls and this was prevented by pretreatment with mg115 (fig. 5 h). tam treatment increased
the levels of nuclear staining for er (fig. 5i) but this
immunoreactivity was not further enhanced by pretreatment with mg115 (fig. 5j). in mcf-7 cells, er
was much less responsive to pretreatment with mg115
(fig. 5 l) relative to controls (fig. 5k). in contrast, we were
unable to detect changes in staining intensities of er (or
er) protein in the ishikawa cells by the immunostaining methods employed following mg115, e2 or tam
treatments (data not shown).

(fig. 4d). the eﬀect of tam as ligand for er was
www.endocrinology-journals.org

we wanted to exclude the possibility that the eﬀects we
observed on er protein levels were due to regulation of
mrna. er mrna levels were not significantly altered
in either cell line after a 3-h incubation with either e2
or tam relative to the  xxxg861xxx  housekeeping gene
(fig. 6a and b). however, a significant increase in er
mrna compared with control (pc0·05) was observed
following 3 h of treatment with e2 in the mcf-7 cell
line, conversely tam led to a decrease in er mrna
(fig. 6c and d). pretreatment of the cells with mg115
did not influence changes in the mrna levels with
either compound and consequently the mechanisms
responsible were not investigated further.

levels by inactivating the proteasome pathway. mcf-7
lysates showed a significant increase in akt phosphorylation by 30 min following dosing of the cells with e2
(pc0·05; fig. 7a). this significant increase in akt
phosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment of the cells
with 50µm ly2940002 pi3k inhibitor, confirming that
akt was phosphorylated by pi3k in response to e2.
pretreatment of the cells with the proteasome pathway
inhibitor mg115 did not aﬀect activation of the akt
pathway. in the ishikawa cells, akt phosphorylation
was not significantly increased (fig. 7b). western blot
analysis of er protein levels within nuclear and
cytosolic/cell membrane fractions from mcf-7 cells
showed that they have detectable levels of the protein in
both fractions.
several conflicting reports have been published as to
whether proliferation of mcf-7 cells stimulated by e2 is
coupled to phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and activation of
the map kinase (mapk) non-genomic signalling
pathway. we assessed  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation levels
in both cell types. no increase in phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 was observed in mcf-7 cells following e2 or
tam treatment (fig. 8a). however, rapid activation
of the pathway was observed when mcf-7 cells were

treated with  xxxg681xxx  (egf), a

interestingly, phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 is significantly
induced in the ishikawa cell type, 30 min after treatment
with e2, but only in cells with an mg115-inhibited
proteasome pathway (pc0·05; fig. 8b). when cells were
incubated with 30µm  xxxd1169xxx , mek inhibitor
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was abolished confirming
that mek was responsible for the phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in response to e2 treatment.

discussion
the aim of this study was to investigate the role of
ligand-mediated degradation and transcription activation pathways in er subtype-mediated action of
tamoxifen and  xxxd2037xxx , comparatively between breast
and uterine cancer cells. we have shown that the er
protein is targeted for degradation following  xxxd2037xxx 
binding in the mcf-7 breast carcinoma cell type and
that inhibition of the proteasome pathway stops this loss
of protein (fig. 4c). our results have suggested that this
is independent of er gene transcription as the loss of
protein was not accompanied by a decrease in mrna

2004). a further study where mcf-7 cells were
transiently transfected with an er expression plasmid
showed that the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin had no
eﬀect on the marginal  xxxd2037xxx -induced er degradation observed (peekhaus et al. 2004). however, although
the degradation pathways involved in the control of
endogenous er cannot be directly compared with
those created by over-expression of the er expression
protein in this cell model, the data suggested that the
proteasome pathway must be inhibited before treatment
of the cells with  xxxd2037xxx , a state not investigated in
the peekhaus et al. (2004) study. the results of our study
have suggested that er is also a target for the
proteasome in human breast cancer-derived cells. by
both western blot and immunocytochemical staining
methods, we have confirmed that er is targeted for
degradation via the proteasome pathway on binding
 xxxd2037xxx , but not tamoxifen, in the mcf-7 cell line
(figs 4a and 5 g and i) (wijayaratne & mcdonnell
2001).
a key finding of this study was that unliganded er
protein was found to increase in mcf-7 cells with an
inhibited proteasome pathway; this was not found for
er (figs 4a and c and 5f). these findings confirmed
that er is a target for the proteasome pathway in an
unliganded state and, in the absence of an active
proteasome and ligand, er is ubiquitinated and
immobilised in the nuclear matrix (reid et al. 2003). it is
interesting to note that in this instance no increase in
er protein was observed; we suggest that, unlike er,
er is not a target for the proteasome in an unliganded
state in the mcf-7 cell type. tamoxifen did not lead to
reduced levels of er or er proteins in the mcf-7
cell type, suggesting that tamoxifen binding stabilises
both the receptors, in line with the findings of others
(wijayaratne & mcdonnell 2001, preisler-mashek et al.
2002, tschugguel et al. 2003) (fig. 4a and c). it is of note
that tamoxifen, although leading to an increase in er
protein, led to a decrease in er mrna, providing
evidence for the hypothesis that this compound stabilises
the protein and does not increase protein synthesis.
tamoxifen and e2 have opposite eﬀects on er subtype
stability in the breast cell line investigated, supporting
tamoxifen’s role as an anti-oestrogen in breast cancer.
in this study, e2 and tamoxifen have analogous eﬀects
on er degradation in the uterine cell type. we have
demonstrated for the first time that tamoxifen induces
ligand-mediated degradation of er protein, an eﬀect
requiring an active proteasome (fig. 4d). in other cell
lines, tamoxifen increases er stability (lonard & smith
2002, marsaud et al. 2003, peekhaus et al. 2004).
increasing the er:er ratio by transfection in t47d

er regulation is cell type specific

2004); we suggest that tamoxifen’s ability to downregulate er may play a role in the proliferative eﬀects
of the drug in the human uterus (tomas et al. 1995,
goldstein 2001). e2 induces ligand-mediated degradation of er thus reducing the er:er ratio in this cell
type, allowing er-mediated proliferation to proceed.
interestingly, wijayaratne & mcdonnell (2001) demonstrated that tamoxifen could induce degradation of a
mutant er protein unable to bind dna, suggesting
that the dna-binding capacity of the receptor was
necessary for stabilisation of the protein by this ligand.
as observed in the mcf-7 cells, unliganded er
proteins are not subject to proteasomal degradation,
suggesting that a ligand-induced conformational change
is required for ubiquitination to occur (fig. 4d).
these converse eﬀects of  xxxd2037xxx  and tamoxifen on
er subtype degradation are in line with the hypotheses
that the classical model for er signalling is oversimplified, and various other cell-specific co-activators and
co-repressors bind to and influence activation and
degradation of the ligand-bound receptors within
diﬀerent target cell types (nawaz et al. 1999, lonard et al.
2000, mckenna & o’malley 2001, uchikawa et al.
2003). it is clear that ligand-induced conformational
changes, allowing interaction with cell-specific cofactors,
are key in target cell response to oestrogen and serms.
further characterisation studies are required to determine which proteins are central components in this
pathway and their expression levels within the two cell
types.
to further evaluate the eﬀect of e2 and tamoxifen on
the transcriptional activities of the ers we investigated
the involvement of er in the activation of pathways
leading to phosphorylation of the akt and erk proteins
in both breast and uterine cell lines. recent studies have
described rapid non-genomic actions of er stimulated
by e2 leading to a substantial increase in pakt and cell
proliferation in mcf-7 (marquez & pietras 2001) and
vascular endothelial cells (pedram et al. 2002). integration of non-genomic and genomic activation of er has
been described, involving oestrogen activation of the
pi3k/akt pathway through er, terminating in
interaction with nuclear er altering its expression and
activity in mcf-7 cells (stoica et al. 2003). following
confirmation that in mcf-7 cells e2 treatment rapidly
increases pakt levels, we have shown that tamoxifen
does not stimulate phosphorylation of akt (fig. 7b). we
propose that tamoxifen’s inability to activate the
pi3k/akt signalling pathway in mcf-7 cells may
contribute to its inhibition of cell proliferation. e2 or
tamoxifen did not activate phosphorylation of akt in
ishikawa cells, suggesting that classical genomic activation of transcription is responsible for the proliferative
eﬀects of these compounds in the uterine cell type.
in contrast to akt, no increase in phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 was observed following e2 or tamoxifen
journal of molecular endocrinology (2005) 35, 421–432

treatment of mcf-7 cells (fig. 8a) confirming previous
reports (lobenhofer & marks 2000, caristi et al. 2001)
but conflicting with others (song et al. 2002). we
confirmed that the mapk/erk signalling cascade could
be activated in our mcf-7 cell model by egf, a
well-documented activator of the mapk cascade, and
therefore suggest that varying experimental conditions
including culture media, cell type variation and
sensitivity of detection methods could explain this
discrepancy. we have demonstrated for the first time
e2-induced phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the ishikawa
cell type only in the absence of an active proteasome
pathway (fig. 8b). we have shown that er is rapidly
degraded via the proteasome pathway in response to e2,
and an excess of er protein levels within the cell, in
the presence of mg115, may lead to increased
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in this cell type.
further investigations are required to determine the role
of er in non-genomic signalling, although evidence
from the erko mouse model describes oestrogeninduced activation of the mapk signalling cascade,
suggesting a role for er (singh et al. 2000).
in conclusion, our data have demonstrated tamoxifen
and e2 control of er subtype stability and that
non-genomic activation of transcription pathways is cell
specific.
