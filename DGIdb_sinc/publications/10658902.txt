abstract
mitochondrially-bound  xxxg633xxx  (ec 1.3.99.11) catalyzes the fourth
sequential step in the de novo synthesis of  xxxd870xxx . the enzyme has been
identified as or surmised to be the pharmacological target for isoxazol, triazine, cinchoninic
acid and (naphtho)quinone derivatives, which exerted antiproliferative, immunosuppressive,
and antiparasitic effects. despite this broad spectrum of biological and clinical relevance,
there have been no comparative studies on drug- xxxg633xxx  interactions.
here, we describe a study of the inhibition of the purified recombinant human and rat
 xxxg633xxx  by ten compounds. 1,4-naphthoquinone, 5,8-hydroxy-naphthoquinone and the natural compounds juglon, plumbagin and polyporic acid (quinone
derivative) were found to function as alternative electron acceptors with 10 – 30% of control
enzyme activity. the human and rat enzyme activity was decreased by 50% by the natural
compound lawsone ( \ 500 and 49 mm, respectively) and by the derivatives dichloroally-lawsone (67 and 10 nm), lapachol (618 and 61 nm) and  xxxd243xxx  (15 mm and 698 nm). with
respect to the quinone co-substrate of the  xxxg633xxx ,  xxxd243xxx 
(kic =2.7 mm) and dichloroally-lawsone (kic = 9.8 nm) were shown to be competitive
inhibitors of human  xxxg633xxx .  xxxd243xxx  (kic = 60 nm) was also a

dent inhibitor of the rat enzyme, with the lowest inhibition constant (k *=
i
determined so far for mammalian dihydroorotate dehydrogenases. another inhibitor,  xxxd363xxx  was previously reported to be a slow-binding inhibitor of the human dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase [w. knecht, m. löffler, species-related inhibition of human and rat dihyroorotate dehydrogenase by immunosuppressive isoxazol and cinchoninic acid derivatives,
biochem. pharmacol. 56 (1998) 1259 – 1264]. the slow binding features of this potent
inhibitor (k *=1.8
nm) with the human enzyme, were verified and seen to be one of the
i
reasons for the narrow therapeutic window (efficacy versus toxicity) reported from clinical
trials on its antiproliferative and immunosuppressive action. with respect to the substrate
dihydroorotate,  xxxd243xxx  was an uncompetitive inhibitor of human  xxxg633xxx  (kiu =11.6 mm) and a non-competitive inhibitor of the rat enzyme (kiu = 905/
kic =1012 nm). 1.5 mm polyporic acid, a natural quinone from fungi, influenced the activity
of the human enzyme only slightly; the activity of the rat enzyme was decreased by 30%.

1. introduction
 xxxg633xxx  ( xxxg633xxx ) catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to  xxxd2794xxx , the fourth step in pyrimidine de novo synthesis. in higher
eukaryotes,  xxxg633xxx  is exclusively located at the inner mitochondrial membrane, whereas the other enzymes are located in the cytosol of the
cell [1,2]. the mammalian  xxxg633xxx  resembles succinate dehydrogenase, the
second complex of the respiratory chain with respect to the ch substrate
oxidation, the electron acceptor ubiquinone and the final acceptor molecular
oxygen. the enzymes of pyrimidine metabolism were determined long ago to be of
great importance for the development of therapeutic agents against malignant cell
proliferation. however the lately increasing interest in  xxxg633xxx  is due to its role
as a target for a number of biologically active chemical or natural compounds.
these compounds were found to interfere with aberrant immunological reactions,
to combat parasitic protozoa infections like malaria, to prevent the spreading of
animal parasitic diseases, and to support antiviral therapies, by lowering the
intracellular concentrations of pyrimidines nucleotides [3–8]. the mode of action
and the molecular interactions of those compounds with  xxxg633xxx  in different
organisms are far from being fully understood. due to its membrane association
and low abundance in tissues and cells,  xxxg633xxx  has not been available in large
amounts for characterization and routine inhibitor studies [9–11] until the overexpression and purification of recombinant mammalian enzymes [12,13]. we described the overexpression of the complete rat enzyme (43 kda) and the large
fragment of the human  xxxg633xxx  (43 kda) by means of the baculovirus vector
expression system in insect cells and also in escherichia coli [13–15]. in our
experiments, we identified fmn as the sole redox cofactor, which transfers
electrons directly to ubiquinone without the participation of a divalent metal center.

the rat  xxxg633xxx  revealed very high similarity to the human  xxxg633xxx  (88%
of the amino acid residues deduced are identical, 92% are similar) and to the
 xxxg633xxx  from the mouse (95% identity and 96% similarity as deduced from the
mus musculus  xxxg633xxx  cdna deposited with the embl
sequence data bank, accession no. af029667, by knecht and löffler, 1997).
despite this high conservation, kinetic experiments gave evidence for a different
susceptibility of the rat and human  xxxg633xxx  to the cinchoninic acid  xxxd363xxx 
and the isoxazol derivative  xxxd2450xxx  [16]. 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives, such
as lawsone, lapachol, dcl and  xxxd243xxx  were reported to interfere with the
oxidation of dihydroorotate, but were not investigated with the enzyme isolated
from man. the 1,4-naphthoquinones were also described as inhibitors of quinonedependent oxidoreductases of the inner mitochondrial membrane with profound
effects on growth and proliferation of eukaryotic cells, but only  xxxd243xxx  passed
clinical trials and received approval to combat plasmodium falciparum and pneumocystis carinii. [6,17,18]. because of 3d structural similarities of the naphthoquinone
ring of dcl with  xxxd363xxx , it was the rationale of this study to compare the
1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives and their interactions with  xxxg633xxx  to  xxxd363xxx .  xxxd363xxx  was previously shown to inhibit the human enzyme in a
time-dependent (slow-binding) manner [16]. the ubiquinone analogue polyporic
acid was found in large quantities in the mushroom hapalopilus rutilans, which
grows on deciduous trees of central europe. only recently, it has been described to
interfere into the oxidation of dihydroorotate using rat liver mitochondria [19].
since an effect of fungal polyporic acid in a bona fide case history of human
poisoning could not be unequivocally proved, this natural compound was included
in the present in vitro study on purified recombinant human  xxxg633xxx . rodents,
especially rats and mice, are often used as animal models of human diseases or
metabolism for in vivo testing of biologically active compounds — as in the case
with polyporic acid. therefore we also investigated enzyme inhibition of the
recombinant rat  xxxg633xxx  by the compounds described above. the results are
compared to the data obtained with the human enzyme. the structures of the nine
tested compounds are shown in fig. 1.

grown on oak, birch and alder trees, was a gift from dr j. langner, halle,
germany [19].
computer programs used were from jandel scientific (sigma plot), autodesk,
(hyperchem) and wavefunction, (pc spartan plus).

2.2. purification of human and rat  xxxg633xxx 
recombinant human and rat  xxxg633xxx  were obtained from baculovirus
infected insect cells by purification protocols described previously. the activity ratio
between the recombinant enzyme and the endogenous insect  xxxg633xxx  as
determined in noninfected insect cells was 240:1 and 260:1, respectively, [13,14].
co-purification of the insect enzyme should be negligible, because of the huge
excess of recombinant enzyme and because the binding to the cation-exchange

65

chromatography is expected to be different for the insect enzyme. there are only
51% of amino acid residues similar between the human and drosophila
melanogaster  xxxg633xxx .

2.3. enzyme assay
enzyme assays were done as described earlier [13,14]. at 30°c, the oxidation of
the substrate dihydroorotate with the quinone co-substrate, was coupled to the
reduction of the chromogen 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol. decylubiquinone (qd),
instead of ubiquinone (q10), was used because of its higher solubility in the assay
medium; moreover, it was found to give a two to three-fold elevation of the
 xxxg633xxx  activity [13]. the reaction mixture contained 0.1 mm qd, 1 mm
l-dihydroorotate, 0.06 mm dichlorophenol-indophenol, 0.1% triton x-100 in 50
mm tris-hcl buffer, and 150 mm kcl, ph 8.0. the reaction was started by
addition of the enzyme. the loss in absorbance of the blue dye was monitored at
600 nm; o = 18.800 l mol − 1 cm − 1. stock solutions of all naphthoquinone derivatives and polyporic acid were prepared freshly in dimethylsulfoxide with further
dilutions in the solvent. 2% dimethylsulfoxide in the assays was found not to
interfere with  xxxg633xxx  activity.  xxxd363xxx  was dissolved in buffer. exposure of
the  xxxg633xxx  to a range of concentrations of inhibitors was performed as
explained under kinetic analyses. in an other set of experiments, under saturating
substrate concentrations, 0.1 mm decylubiquinone was replaced by the same
concentration of polyporic acid or naphthoquinone derivatives in order to assess
their function as alternative electron acceptors.

2.4. kinetic analysis
the kinetic constants for the human and rat recombinant dhodehases used for
this study were reported recently: km for dihydroorotate =9.4 mm; km for qd =
13.7 mm (human enzyme [13]); km for dihydroorotate =11.5 mm; and km for
qd =5.9 mm (rat enzyme [14]).

2.4.1. determination of ic50 6alues
to determine the inhibitory potency of drugs, the initial velocity of the  xxxg633xxx  reaction was measured at saturating substrate concentrations of dihydroorotate (1 mm) and qd (100 mm) with varying concentrations of the compounds (in
the range from 1 nm up to 500 mm, if not specified otherwise). the equation was
fitted to the initial velocities
6=v{1 + [i]/ic50}

[i] is the inhibitor concentration

(1)

in order to find the drug concentration causing 50% inhibition of the enzyme
activity (ic50).  xxxd363xxx  was recently reported to act as a slow binding inhibitor
on the human enzyme, therefore steady state velocities were used to determine the
ic50 value for  xxxd363xxx  and the human  xxxg633xxx  [16].

2.4.2. determination of the type of inhibition
to identify the type of inhibition and to estimate the values of the inhibition
constants the following experiments were designed. three fixed inhibitor concentrations were chosen for three sets of assays. the initial velocities of the enzymatic
reaction were determined either with varying concentrations of dihydroorotate
(1.56 – 1000 mm) and 100 mm qd or with varying concentration of qd (1.56–1000
mm) and 1 mm dihydroorotate. the following equation was fitted to the results
6 = v ×[a]/(km +[a])

([a] is the substrate concentration)

(2)

deviations of v and km values in comparison to the constants for the non-inhibited
enzymatic reaction were considered to determine whether the inhibition was competitive, uncompetitive or non-competitive, respectively [20]. once an inhibition
pattern was established, the appropriate equation was modelled to the entire data
set
competitive inhibition
uncompetitive inhibition

6= v× [a]/{km × (1+ [i]/kic)+ [a]}
6 =v× [a]/{km × (1+ [i]/kiu)+ [a]}

or
non − competitive inhibition
6 = v× [a]/{km ×(1 +[i]/kic)+ (1+ [i]/kiu)× [a]}

(5)

(kic is the competitive inhibition constant, kiu is the uncompetitive inhibition
constant [21])

2.5. slow-binding inhibitors
progress curves were obtained from two different experimental procedures. the
slow development of  xxxg633xxx  inhibition by 5 nm  xxxd363xxx  or 10 nm dcl
was followed by monitoring the decrease in dichlorophenol-indophenol absorption
immediately after addition of the enzyme. experiments to determine the recovery of
the enzyme activity following preincubation with the inhibitors were performed as
follows.  xxxg633xxx  was preincubated in buffer (0.1% triton x-100, 50 mm
tris-hcl buffer, and 150 mm kcl, ph 8.0) with 250 nm  xxxd363xxx  or 500 nm
dcl, respectively, for 5 min at 30°c. an aliquot of the incubation mixture was
then diluted 1:50 with the reaction buffer containing 1 mm dihydroorotate and 100
mm qd. recovery of enzyme activity was followed by monitoring the decrease of
dye absorbance and calculation of the amount of reduced dichlorophenolindophenol.
the eq. (6) was fitted to the progress curves for the inhibition of  xxxg633xxx 
activity by slow-binding inhibitors:
[p]t =6ft + (6i −6f)(1 −e − kt)/k

(6)

where [p]t is the product concentration at time t, 6i is the initial rate after starting
the reaction, 6f is the final velocity, and k is the first-order rate constant of the
transient [22,23]. the inhibition constants derived from model c [24] in fig. 2 are:

fig. 2. models for slow development of enzyme inhibition: (a) describes the uninhibited reaction. it is
a competing reaction for all following schemes; (b) describes a simply reversible competitive inhibition
that leads to slow-binding inhibition, because of the low values of the velocity constants k3 and k − 3
relative to enzyme turnover; (c) describes an initial binding of the inhibitor by the enzyme that leads to
the formation of an enzyme–inhibitor complex (ei). this complex undergoes an isomerisation of the
enzyme to form a new enzyme–inhibitor complex (ei*); and (d) describes an initial binding of the
inhibitor by the enzyme that leads to the formation of an enzyme – inhibitor complex (exi). then the
enzyme is irreversibly inactivated due to formation of a covalent bond between the enzyme and a
reactive group on the inhibitor. schemes modified from [26].

k3 =[e][i]/[ei] and k*i = [e][i]/[ei] +[ei*]

(7)

to determine the inhibition constants k3 and k *
i according to szedlacsek and
duggleby [25], the values of 6i and 6f were determined at varying inhibitor
concentrations. eqs. (8) and (9) were fitted to the data.
6i =(v[a])/(km(1 + [i]/k3) +[a])

(8)

6f =(v[a])/(km(1 + [i]/k*)
i +[a])

(9)

the relationship between inhibitor concentration and first order constant k was
used to calculate rate constants k − 7 and k7 using eqs. (10) and (11), respectively.
k =k − 7(1 + [a]/km +[i]/k*)/(1
+ [a]/km + [i]/k3)

3. results

3.1. naphthoquinone and quinone deri6ati6es as alternati6e substrates
some of the naphthoquinones studied here were found to substitute for qd as
electron acceptor of  xxxg633xxx . the results are summarized in table 1. from the
tested compounds only the 2-hydroxy naphthoquinone derivatives (lawsone, lapachol, dcl,  xxxd243xxx ) and  xxxd363xxx  could not function as alternative substrates
for  xxxg633xxx .

3.2. determination of ic50
the ic50 values as a practical readout of the relative effects of different
substances on enzyme activity under comparable assay and laboratory conditions
were obtained from dose response curves. it is obvious from the values for the
human and rat  xxxg633xxx  given in table 2, that the rat enzyme was affected to
a greater extent than the human  xxxg633xxx  by the 2-hydroxy substituted 1,4
naphthoquinones. in contrast  xxxd363xxx  was shown to be a more potent inhibitor
of the human enzyme (ic50 =10.3 nm) than of the rat enzyme (ic50 = 367 nm)
[16]. the ic50 values of dcl and lapachol obtained with the human enzyme were
seven-fold and ten-fold higher than those obtained with the rat enzyme. for
 xxxd243xxx  even a 20-fold difference was observed. the ic50 value of lawsone for
the human enzyme was outside the range of the concentration tested. under the

inhibitor constants for competitive inhibition (kic) and uncompetitive inhibition (kiu) were determined by measuring the initial velocities of the  xxxg633xxx  catalyzed reaction in the presence or absence
of the inhibitor. the initial velocities of each were determined either with varying concentrations of
dihydroorotate (1.56–1000 mm dho) and 100 mm decylubiquinone (qd) or with varying concentration
of decylubiquinone (1.56–1000 mm) and 1 mm dihydroorotate. inhibitor constants were derived from
best fits of all data and are given9s.d.
b
data for the rat enzyme obtained with  xxxd363xxx  under the same assay conditions [16] were shown
for comparison.

present assay conditions of 1 mm dihydroorotate and 100 mm qd as substrates, the
activity of the human  xxxg633xxx  was only marginally affected by 1.5 mm
polyporic acid. the decrease in activity was 5–10%. the activity of the rat enzyme
was 20 – 30% decreased by 1.5 mm polyporic acid. solubility problems with higher
concentrations of polyporic acid did not allow ic50 determinations.

3.3. determination of kinetic constants
since dcl and  xxxd363xxx  were the most potent inhibitors under study for each
species, they were chosen for determination of inhibition type and inhibitor
constants.  xxxd243xxx  was also included due to its use in several clinical applications. the results are summarized in table 3. the substituted 1,4 naphthoquinones
 xxxd243xxx  and dcl were found to be competitive inhibitors of the human
 xxxg633xxx  with respect to the ubiquinone co-substrate qd.  xxxd243xxx  was also
a competitive inhibitor of the rat  xxxg633xxx . with respect to dihydroorotate,
 xxxd243xxx  and dcl were uncompetitive inhibitors of the human  xxxg633xxx  and
 xxxd243xxx  was a non-competitive inhibitor of the rat  xxxg633xxx . in contrast,
 xxxd363xxx  did not show pure competitive inhibition of rat  xxxg633xxx  with respect
to qd. its non-competitive inhibition of the rat  xxxg633xxx  is better described as
‘mixed-type’ inhibition, since the kic was found to be more than ten-fold smaller
than the kiu. we propose therefore an interaction of  xxxd363xxx  with the qd binding
site of the rat enzyme.

70

w. knecht et al. / chemico-biological interactions 124 (2000) 61–76

in the present study dcl was found to be a slow (time-dependent) inhibitor of
the rat enzyme, but not of the human enzyme. the assumption of slow-binding
inhibition of the human  xxxg633xxx  by  xxxd363xxx  [16] was verified by the present
study. the results were interpreted along models for the time-dependent inhibition
of enzymes given in fig. 2 [24]. the slow increase in inactivation of  xxxg633xxx  by
 xxxd363xxx  and dcl (fig. 3a and b) was interpreted as a characteristic feature of
slow-binding inhibitors [23,25]. the reversibility of the inhibition was demonstrated
by dilution of samples, following preincubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor. a
subsequent slow recovery of enzyme activity could be observed (fig. 3a and b).
this observation gave good evidence that the inactivation of  xxxg633xxx  by the
two compounds was not irreversible (model d, fig. 2).
for further characterization of the time-dependent inhibition of  xxxg633xxx 
with dcl and  xxxd363xxx , we tested the dependence of the first-order rate constant
k on qd concentration according to recommended methods. for both compounds
k increased with decreasing concentrations of qd (fig. 4), a feature indicating a
competitive type of inhibition with respect to the varied substrate.
to determine the inhibition constants of  xxxd363xxx  and dcl, the dependence of
6i and 6f (fig. 5) on varying inhibitor concentrations was determined. the decrease
in initial rate 6i with increasing inhibitor concentrations indicated the use of model

c (fig. 2) to describe the inactivation of  xxxg633xxx  by  xxxd363xxx  and dcl. from
experiments shown in fig. 5, an overall inhibition constant k *i of 1.8 nm could be
calculated for the inhibition of the human  xxxg633xxx  by  xxxd363xxx . a k *i of 0.77
nm was determined for the inhibition of the rat  xxxg633xxx  by dcl. the
dependence of the first order reaction constant k on varying inhibitor concentrations (fig. 6) was used to calculate the rate constants, k − 7 = 0.017 s − 1 and
k7 =0.055 s − 1 for  xxxd363xxx  and k − 7 = 0.031 s − 1 and k7 = 0.063 s − 1 for dcl.

4. discussion
representatives from the 1,4-naphthoquinone class with biological relevance and
known pharmacological anti-pyrimidine effect were tested here for their particular
interaction with purified recombinant human and rat  xxxg633xxx . only partial comparison of compounds with one another and mostly tested
with cells, mitochondria or solubilized parasites have been described so far. we
found that 1,4-naphthoquinone, juglone, plumbagin and 5,8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone could replace, to a certain extent, the ubiquinone as co-substrate of
mammalian  xxxg633xxx , whereas the 2-hydroxy derivatives were found to inhibit
the enzyme activity. we conclude therefore that a c-2 hydroxy substitution is

fig. 5. dependence of initial rate 6i and final velocity 6f on varied inhibitor concentrations. human and
rat  xxxg633xxx  activity was determined with the chromogen reduction assay using oxidized
dichlorophenol-indophenol, dihydroorotate and decylubiquinone at saturating concentrations. reaction
was started by addition of the enzyme. the progress curves (see fig. 3) for the slow development of the
inhibition of rat  xxxg633xxx  by dcl, (a), or human  xxxg633xxx  by  xxxd363xxx , (b), was monitored at
varying concentrations of the inhibitor and constant concentration of the substrates dihydroorotate (1
mm) and decylubiquinone (100 mm). 6i and 6f were determined by fitting eq. (6) to the data; inhibition
constants k3 and k *i were determined by fitting eqs. (8) and (9) (given in section 2) 6i and 6f. the solid
lines represent the fits used to determine k3 and k *,
respectively.

necessary for effective  xxxg633xxx  inhibition. previous reports investigating the
toxic effects of hydroxy substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones in rat hepatocytes came to
the conclusion that a hydroxy substitution in the c-2 position converts the quinone
into a much less electrophilic one with a potential unfavourable for its participation
in redox cycling reactions [26].
with regard to the poor solubility of polyporic acid and the concentrations in the
millimolar range necessary to observe a very moderate effect on  xxxg633xxx 
activity, the poisoning of man observed after the consumption of the mushroom
hapalopilus rutilans is very unlikely to be caused by a specific inhibition of
 xxxg633xxx  by polyporic acid. as an explanation for the effects observed with rat
liver mitochondria [19], the weak inhibition of the purified rat  xxxg633xxx  by
polyporic acid as well as its acceptance as co-substrate, revealed by the present
study, should be considered. then, the reduced form of polyporic acid could
interfere with the oxidation of dihydroubiquinone, which is catalyzed by the
complex iii of the respiratory chain.
the clear ranking of ic50 values, dclb lapacholb atovaquoneb lawsone, obtained in this study, substantiated reports on ki = 27 nm for dcl versus ki = 2.1
mm for lapachol with mouse liver mitochondria and dihydroorotate as varied
substrate [17]. we conclude that the nature of the substituant at c-3 of the
1,4-naphthoquinones could be of critical importance for the efficiency of mammalian  xxxg633xxx  inhibition: lawsone without side-chain was the weakest inhibitor. the replacement of the two chlorine atoms in the strongest inhibitor dcl
by two methyl groups (lapachol) reduced the potency for redox-inhibition; the more
space-filling group of  xxxd243xxx  could be responsible for the further increase of
the ic50 value.
overall structural similarities in the ring systems were obvious when comparing
the structures of  xxxd363xxx  and dcl as obtained from the nci 3-d structure
database with the programme spartan plus (not shown). it seems that the cinchoninic acid ring system of  xxxd363xxx  is of high relevance for the interaction with
the human  xxxg633xxx , whereas the 1,4 naphthoquinone ring is more efficient in
the binding to the rat  xxxg633xxx  (see table 2). in our study we have shown dcl
to be a slow-binding inhibitor of rat  xxxg633xxx . its k *i of 0.77 nm is, to our
knowledge, the lowest inhibition constant reported so far for any inhibitor of
mammalian  xxxg633xxx . on the other hand,  xxxd363xxx  displayed a time-dependent
inactivation of human  xxxg633xxx  but not of the rat enzyme. the k *i value of 1.8
nm was considerably lower than the ki value of 26.5 nm reported for the inhibition
of a n-terminal truncated human  xxxg633xxx  of 39 kda by  xxxd363xxx  [11]. the
human  xxxg633xxx  (43 kda) studied throughout the present study contained a
mitochondrial targeting sequence of 10 amino acids and a transmembrane domaine
of 20 amino acids at the n-terminus and was shown to be properly transported to
mitochondria of insect cells used for the heterologous expression [13]. to explain
the difference of initial enzyme inhibition by  xxxd363xxx , we tested its action on a 30
amino acids n-terminal truncated construct of the recombinant human  xxxg633xxx  which was of comparable affinity for the substrates dihydroorotate and
ubiquinone [löffler and knecht, unpublished data]. since the characteristic profile

74

w. knecht et al. / chemico-biological interactions 124 (2000) 61–76

of slow-binding inactivation of this deletion mutant by  xxxd363xxx  disappeared —
whereas the potent drug effect could be followed (ic50 = 6 nm) — we deduced the
crucial importance of the n-terminal domain of human  xxxg633xxx  for additional
protein-ligand interactions outside the enzyme active site. however, only a high
resolution protein crystal structure will be able to elucidate where and why
additional favourable interactions between enzyme and inhibitor may be gained.
the same is true for the interaction of dcl with the rat  xxxg633xxx . we suggest
that the slow-binding characteristics of  xxxd363xxx  and its high affinity to human
 xxxg633xxx  may explain in part the narrow therapeutic window of efficacy versus
toxicity observed in clinical trials on kidney and liver graft recipients [4].
all species of malaria parasites studied to date rely exclusively on the de novo
pathway for their pyrimidine requirements, because they are unable to salvage
preformed pyrimidine nucleosides or bases. the antiprotozoal, antitrypanosomal
and antibacterial properties of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones, e.g. lapachol from the
indian plant stereospermum suo6olens, and plumbagin from plumbago and diopspyros, led to the synthesis of a variety of novel compounds with more pronounced
biological activity [17,27,28]. the anti-tumour activities of such compounds were
suggested to be the result of a poisoning effect on cell respiration and also on
pyrimidine biosynthesis [17,18]. the strong anti-proliferative efficiency of  xxxd243xxx  with the parasites plasmodium falciparum and pneumcystis carinii was
explained by its binding to a complex iii subunit thereby preventing the flow of
electrons from all respiratory substrates as well as from dihydroorotate to the final
acceptor molecular oxygen. ic50 values of about 1 nm were calculated when
mitochondria of parasites were fed with succinate, dihydroorotate or glycerophosphate as electron donor for the respiratory chain [18]. even if a direct interaction
of  xxxd243xxx  with the parasitic  xxxg633xxx  can be only suggested from the
present study, our work disclosed that  xxxd243xxx  is a competitive inhibitor of the
enzyme from mammals (host of these parasites). although the inhibitor constant
for the human  xxxg633xxx  (kic =2.7 mm) was about 400 fold higher than that of
the rat enzyme (kic =60 nm), it was lower than that determined with the partially
purified plasmodium falciparum  xxxg633xxx  (ki = 27 mm) [29]. the drug concentration effective against pneumocystis carinii, which was experimentally obtained
from immunosuppressed rats, was in the micromolar range. in short-term cultivation of these organisms, growth inhibition was observed with 0.3–3 mm  xxxd243xxx ; the half-maximal inhibition of the parasitic  xxxg633xxx , which was
determined with cell lysates by other authors, was achieved with 10–100 mm of the
drug [6]. with respect to the clinical treatment of subjects with two opportunistic
infections, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and toxoplasma encephalitis [6,30] —
hiv-positive patients need life-long prophylaxis and maintainance therapy — it
seemed desirable to gain information about the interaction of  xxxd243xxx  with the
host  xxxg633xxx . this the more so, since the necessity of pyrimidine de novo
synthesis for clonal expansion of human immunocompetent cells, especially of
t-lymphocytes, has been clearly demonstrated [31].
we have directly compared the inhibition profile of various anti-pyrimidine drugs
— originally discovered or developed in different laboratories — with the recombi-

nant human  xxxg633xxx  by using identical methods of investigation in one
laboratory. rodents, preferentially mice and rats, and rat or mice cell lines are
important tools in evaluating properties of new drugs prior to studies evaluating
drug effects in human beings. however, we have observed some differences between
rat and human enzymes. species-related efficacy of compounds as revealed by our
present and previous study will prompt us to include the rodent enzymes also in
forthcoming studies.
