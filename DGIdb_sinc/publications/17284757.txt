␣- xxxd2490xxx , ⌬6-desaturase gene polymorphism, and the risk of
nonfatal myocardial infarction1–3

abstract
background: ⌬6-desaturase ( xxxg758xxx ) is the rate-limiting step in
the polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) biosynthetic pathway.
objective: the aim was to test whether the common deletion [t/-]
in the promoter of  xxxg758xxx  affects the pufa biosynthetic pathway
and consequently modifies the effect of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  (ala) on
myocardial infarction (mi).
design: case subjects (n ҃1694) with a first nonfatal acute mi were
matched by age, sex, and area of residence to 1694 population-based
control subjects in costa rica. pufas were quantified by gas-liquid
chromatography from plasma and adipose tissue samples. leastsquares means from generalized linear models and odds ratios (ors)
and 95% cis from multiple conditional logistic regression models
were estimated.
results: the prevalence of the variant t/- allele was 48%.  xxxd2318xxx , ␥- xxxd2490xxx , and  xxxd208xxx  decreased in
adipose tissue and plasma with increasing number of copies of the
variant allele with a monotonic trend (p 쏝 0.05 for all). fasting
plasma triacylglycerols by genotype were 2.08 mmol/l for tt, 2.16
mmol/l for t-, and 2.26 mmol/l for - - [ie, homozygous for the
variant (deletion) allele] (p ҃ 0.03). the  xxxg758xxx  deletion was not
associated with mi and did not significantly modify the association
between adipose tissue ala and the risk of mi.
conclusions: the  xxxg758xxx  deletion may prevent the conversion of
ala into very-long-chain pufas. however, this metabolic effect is
not translated into an attenuated risk between ala and mi among
carriers of the variant. it is possible that, at current intakes of ala,
any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the
availability of substrate. further research in populations deficient in
ala intake is warranted.

introduction

very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) pools
originate from the diet and endogenously from elongation and
desaturation of their dietary precursors, ␣- xxxd2490xxx  (nҁ3)
and linoleic acid (nҁ6). both families of  xxxd2154xxx , nҁ3 and
nҁ6, share and compete for the same enzymes (⌬6-desaturase,
⌬5-desaturase, and elongases) in their biosynthesis, and ⌬6desaturase is the rate-limiting step (1–3) (figure 1). the ⌬6desaturase converts ␣- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3n–3) into stearidonic
acid (18:4n–3) and linoleic acid (18:2n– 6) into ␥- xxxd2490xxx 
(18:3n– 6). stearidonic acid and ␥- xxxd2490xxx  are then

554

converted into  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) and  xxxd208xxx 
(20:4n– 6), respectively, through other desaturase (⌬5-desaturase)
and elongase steps. however, most ␣- xxxd2490xxx  and linoleic acid
is either ␤-oxidized to produce energy or stored (4). only a small part
of these  xxxd2154xxx  follow the main biosynthetic pathway or are
elongated into 20:3n–3 or 20:2n– 6, respectively, in what it is considered a dead-end of the pathway, given that the enzymes for further
metabolism are not present in mammals (5, 6).
the ⌬6-desaturase gene ( xxxg758xxx ) is located in chromosome 11
and expressed in almost all human tissues, with the highest expression in the liver, heart, and brain (7). because  xxxg758xxx  was
cloned recently (7), the metabolic effects of polymorphisms in
this gene or their effects on the risk of ischemic heart disease
(ihd) are unknown. it is known that a large proportion of regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) that affect gene
expression are located in the promoter regions (8). one of them,
the rs3834458 (t/-) polymorphism could play an important role
in metabolism because of its location near potential regulatory
regions, such as binding sites for sterol regulatory element–
binding protein 1c (srebp-1c) (9) and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor ␣ (ppar-␣) (10), which regulate the transcription of ⌬6-desaturase (3). the frequency of the variant t/allele is high, which makes it an ideal candidate for gene-diet
interaction studies and risk of ihd.
dietary ␣- xxxd2490xxx , the nҁ3 fatty acid precursor abundant in vegetable oils, is beneficial for ihd (11–17). using adipose tissue as a biomarker of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  intake, we have
shown that ␣- xxxd2490xxx  is associated with a large and significant reduction in the risk of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction
(mi) (17). the potentially protective effect of ␣- xxxd2490xxx 
can be achieved directly on its own (18) or through conversion to
very-long-chain nҁ3  xxxd2154xxx  including epa and docosahexaenoic acid (dha). linoleic acid, the nҁ6 precursor also

figure 1. metabolic pathway of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . both families, nҁ3 and nҁ6  xxxd2154xxx , share the same enzymes. the ⌬6-desaturase converts
linoleic acid (18:2n– 6) into ␥- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3n-6) and ␣- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3n–3) into stearidonic acid (18:4n–3). ␥- xxxd2490xxx  and stearidonic acid are
converted into  xxxd208xxx  and  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), respectively, through other desaturase (⌬5-desaturase) and elongase steps. however, only
a small part of linoleic and ␣-linolenic acids follows the biosynthetic pathway. most is either ␤-oxidized to produce energy or stored, but part of it can also be

abundant in vegetable oils, has been associated with reduced
ihd, although some biosynthetic products such as arachidonic
acid may be proatherogenic (19, 20).
we hypothesized that a deletion in the promoter region of
 xxxg758xxx  that potentially affect gene transcription modifies the
conversion of ␣-linolenic and linoleic acid into very-long-chain
pufa and could attenuate the protective association between
␣- xxxd2490xxx  and mi. an attenuation of the ␣- xxxd2490xxx  effect
on mi risk would suggest that this protection occurs via the conversion of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  to very-long-chain nҁ3  xxxd2154xxx .
subjects and methods

study population
the study design and population has been described previously (17, 21). briefly, eligible case subjects (cases) were men
and women who were diagnosed as survivors of a first acute mi
by 2 independent cardiologists at any of the 6 recruiting hospitals
in the central valley of costa rica for the period of 1994 to 2004
(21). all cases met the world health organization criteria for
mi, which require typical symptoms plus either elevations in
cardiac enzyme concentrations or diagnostic changes in the electrocardiogram (22). enrollment was carried out while cases were
in the hospital’s step-down-unit. one free-living control subject
(control) for each case, matched for age (앐5 y), sex, and area of

residence (county), was randomly selected by using the information available at the national census and statistics bureau of
costa rica. thus, controls are a representative sample of the
costa rican population. participation was 98% for cases and
88% for controls. because of the comprehensive social services
provided in costa rica, all persons living in the recruiting area
had access to medical care without regard to income. therefore,
controls come from the same population that gave rise to the
cases and were not likely to have cardiovascular disease that was
not diagnosed because of poor access to medical care. controls
were ineligible if they had ever had an mi or if they were physically or mentally unable to answer the questionnaires.
the population in the recruiting area for the present study (the
costa rican central valley) fulfills 2 major prerequisites necessary for the effective search of susceptibility genes for human
diseases. it derives from a relatively small number of founders, and
the expansion of the population has occurred by reproduction rather
than by immigration. all participants gave informed consent on
documents approved by the human subjects committee of the
harvard school of public health and the university of costa rica.
data collection
trained personnel visited all study participants at their homes
for data collection, biological specimen collection, and anthropometric measurements. sociodemographic characteristics,

556

baylin et al

medical history, and lifestyle habits were collected by using a
general questionnaire. dietary intake was collected by using a
food-frequency questionnaire that has been developed and validated specifically to assess fatty acid intake among the costa
rican population (23, 24). the instrument also inquired about
type of fat most frequently used for home cooking or frying; it
was confirmed by visual identification at the subject’s home.
biological samples were always collected in the  xxxd2476xxx  an
overnight fast. subcutaneous adipose biopsies were collected
from the upper buttock with a 16 gauge needle by using a modified version of the method described by beynen et al (25). blood
samples (20 ml) were drawn during the same visit into 0.1%
edta-coated tubes after a 12–14 h fast. blood sample tubes
were immediately stored at 4 °c and protected from light. within
36 h, they were centrifuged at 1430 ҂ g for 20 min at 4 °c to
isolate and aliquot plasma and white blood cells. blood samples
were sealed and stored under nitrogen at ҁ80 °c until analysis in
our laboratory.
fatty acid analysis
 xxxd2154xxx  from adipose tissue and plasma were quantified by
gas-liquid chromatography (24, 26). peak retention times and
area percentages of total  xxxd2154xxx  were identified by using
known standards (nucheck prep, elysium, mn) and analyzed
with the agilent technologies chemstation a.08.03 software
(agilent technologies, santa clara, ca). twelve duplicate samples, indistinguishable from others, were analyzed throughout
the study for quality control purposes.  xxxd2154xxx  in plasma
were quantified in a subsample of the study population (n ҃
196). interassay cvs in adipose tissue and plasma were 3.87%
and 3.15% for ␣- xxxd2490xxx , 2.63% and 0.85% for linoleic
acid, 5.87% and 1.79% for  xxxd208xxx , and 14.2% and
7.95% for epa.

plate throughout the study to assess the genotyping reproducibility. reproducibility was 99.9%, and 쏝1% of control and unknown samples had missing values. all samples, cases and controls, were blinded.
statistical analysis
all data were analyzed with the statistical analysis systems
software (sas institute inc, cary, nc). the number of controls
with available fatty acid information was 1820 for adipose tissue
and 196 for plasma. the subsample with available plasma is a
random sample of the whole study population and general characteristics of those participants with plasma information did not
differ significantly from those without it. least-squares means
and 95% cis from generalized linear models adjusted for potential confounders were used to report the relation between adipose
tissue and plasma  xxxd2154xxx  and  xxxg758xxx  genotype. for those
variables that did not have a normal distribution, log transformations were carried out and geometric means are reported instead. the significance of differences in health characteristics
and potential confounders were assessed by mcnemar’s test and
paired t tests if data were normally distributed or by wilcoxon’s
signed-rank test if data were not normally distributed. after deleting missing values and unmatched participants, a total of 1694
case-control pairs with complete data on adipose  xxxd2154xxx ,
 xxxg758xxx  genotypes, and potential confounders were used in the
final analysis to evaluate the effect of  xxxg758xxx  genotypes on the
risk of mi. more controls are available for the  xxxd2154xxx  analysis
than for the mi analysis because the design is matched and, when
deleting one subject due to missing values (either case or control), their pair has to be deleted too. odds ratios (ors) and 95%
cis were estimated from multiple conditional logistic regression
models. medians were used to classify people in low and high
adipose tissue ␣- xxxd2490xxx  groups. likelihood ratio tests
were used to test for interactions.

snp selection and genotyping
of the 2 snps reported in the public databases in the core
promoter region, the rs3834458 (t/-) polymorphism was selected because of its high frequency and its proximity to potential
regulatory regions, such as the binding sites for srebp-1c (9)
and ppar-␣ (10), which regulate the transcription of ⌬6desaturase (3). an approximate 1000 bp fragment containing
regulatory regions in the promoter of the  xxxg758xxx  gene was resequenced in 96 participants, but there were no novel snps at this
site among the costa ricans.
genotyping was carried out by using a variation of the allelespecific assay (asa). the snp genotyping procedure consisted
of 3 steps. in step one, dna fragments were obtained by using
pcr primers designed according to each snp’s vicinity sequence. the reverse primers contained an artificially introduced
sequence (derived from the bacteriophage m13) at the 5⬘ end,
which was identical across all snps. in step 2, the snp was
genotyped by asa with the use of allele-specific forward primers and a reverse primer whose sequence is universal for all
snps. universal primers were labeled at the 5⬘ end with one of
3 fluorescent dyes (fluorescein, hexachlorofluorescein, or tetrachlorofluorescein). in step 3, asa products were separated by
capillary electrophoresis with the abi prism 310 genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, perkin-elmer, wellesley, ma) and
analyzed by using the genotyper software (applied biosystems,
foster city, ca). eight control samples were genotyped for each

results

the general characteristics of the population by case-control
status are shown in table 1. the risk factors by case-control
status are distributed as expected in an adult population from a
country in nutrition transition. the prevalence of the variant allele
(deletion) in the costa rican population was 48%. the observed
allele frequencies were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium.
we evaluated the effect of the  xxxg758xxx  common deletion on
adipose tissue pufa concentrations among the controls (n ҃
1820) in an attempt to assess the effect of this polymorphism on
the enzyme activity. to isolate the effect of the genotype on the
metabolic levels of very-long-chain pufa, we adjusted for dietary concentrations of these  xxxd2154xxx  and other dietary nҁ3 or
nҁ6  xxxd2154xxx . dietary variables are expressed as percentage of
total energy intake. adjustment for total energy intake and further adjustments for other potential confounders did not significantly change the results. as shown in figure 2 for adipose
tissue, epa, ␥- xxxd2490xxx , and  xxxd208xxx  decreased
with the number of copies of the variant allele (one or 2 deletions)
in a monotonic trend. in contrast, the “dead-end” products 20:
3n–3 and 20:2n– 6 increased with the number of deletions (p
value 쏝 0.05 for all comparisons). these results were consistent
when the analysis was conducted in a subgroup of 196 randomly
selected plasma samples from the same population (table 2).

discussion

we found that a common deletion in the  xxxg758xxx  promoter was
associated with low epa and  xxxd208xxx  in tissues. the
consistency of the observed pattern in both nҁ3 and nҁ6 fatty
acids in 2 different tissues (adipose and plasma) together with the
monotonic trend by genotype gives substantial plausibility to the
hypothesis of decreased ⌬6-desaturase activity with an increased
number of copies of the common deletion (t/-). the increase in
fasting plasma triacylglycerols associated with the variant is
consistent with the known effect of very-long-chain nҁ3 fatty
acids on triacylglycerol concentrations. this polymorphism is
not associated with the risk of mi and does not modify the
association of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  and mi in the whole population.
our findings on the effect of the  xxxg758xxx  promoter t/-deletion
on  xxxd2154xxx  are consistent with findings from a recent study that
also showed a metabolic effect of polymorphisms and haplotypes
of  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  (⌬5-desaturase) on serum phospholipid
 xxxd2154xxx  (27). the mechanism for the observed effects of the
t/- deletion on the pufa biosynthetic pathway probably involves a decrease in ⌬6-desaturase transcription that affects the
conversion of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  and linoleic acid into the verylong-chain pufas  xxxd208xxx  and epa. it is known that the
fatty acid 20:2n– 6 represents a dead-end product in the biosynthetic pufa pathway (figure 1), given that the enzyme necessary for its conversion is not present in mammals (5, 6). it is
therefore not surprising that carriers of the deletion have higher
concentrations of 20:6n– 6 than do noncarriers. consistently,
epa concentrations decreased with the number of t/- deletions,
and 20:3n–3 increased in both adipose tissue and plasma. our
data also suggest that our findings cannot be attributed to substrate availability, because ␣- xxxd2490xxx  and linoleic acid (in
adipose tissue, plasma, and diet) did not differ significantly by
genotype.
our finding of an association between the t/- deletion and
higher triacylglycerol concentrations, although modest, is not
surprising. the hypotriacylglycerolemic effect of dietary verylong-chain nҁ3  xxxd2154xxx  is well described in the literature (28).
the effect of endogenous pools of very-long-chain nҁ3 fatty
acids could affect plasma triacylglycerol concentrations through
similar mechanisms. very-long-chain nҁ3  xxxd2154xxx  increase
 xxxg1337xxx  expression in adipose tissue, which may result
in an increase in  xxxg1337xxx -mediated triacylglycerol
clearance (28). the t/- deletion has strong effects on very-longchain pufas. for example, the interquartile range for  xxxd208xxx  (0.37% to 0.56% of total  xxxd2154xxx ) is comparable to
the difference in adipose tissue  xxxd208xxx  between the
homozygous for the  xxxg758xxx  variant (- -) and the homozygous for
the wild type (tt) (0.41% and 0.52% of total  xxxd2154xxx , respectively). thus, on one hand, the t/- deletion may prevent the
synthesis of very-long-chain nҁ3  xxxd2154xxx , which are protective (29, 30), and increase fasting triacylglycerols, which are an
independent risk factor for ihd (28). on the other hand, the t/deletion could prevent the accumulation of  xxxd208xxx  in
tissues. adipose tissue  xxxd208xxx  has been associated with
an increased risk of mi (19, 20), suggesting that endogenous

pools of  xxxd208xxx  may have an effect on mi. these effects
may be related to the role of  xxxd208xxx  as a precursor of
proinflammatory eicosanoids (31) or mediated by insulin sensitivity, because altered distribution of  xxxd208xxx  in tissues
has been correlated with alterations in lipogenesis and insulin action
(32). given that this polymorphism has both negative and favorable
effects on metabolism, it is not surprising that the net effect of the t/deletion on the risk of mi is null in this population.
several studies have not found a protective association between ␣- xxxd2490xxx  and mi (33–36). although part of the
discrepancies may be explained by different ranges of intake and
different compositions of the diet, it is possible that genetic
background modifies the effect of dietary pufa on the development of ihd, particularly if genetic mutations in the desaturases and elongases, which are directly responsible for pufa
biosynthesis, are present. furthermore, from isotope-labeled
␣-linolenic feeding studies, the range of conversion of
␣-linolenic to epa has been estimated between 0.2% and 21%
(37). this considerable variation may be due, in part, to dietary
influences (feedback regulation and nҁ6 competition for the
shared enzymes) but also to genetic background. we did not find
a modifying effect of the  xxxg758xxx  deletion on the protective effect
of ␣- xxxd2490xxx . however, note that the relation between
adipose tissue ␣- xxxd2490xxx  and mi is not linear, suggesting
that ␣- xxxd2490xxx  does not confer additional protection at
higher adipose tissue levels (쏜 0.70% total  xxxd2154xxx ; a baylin
and h campos, 2006, unpublished observations). furthermore,
the pathway is feedback regulated, and a high intake of
␣-linolenic and linoleic acid down-regulates the ⌬6-desaturase.
it is possible that at current intakes of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the
availability of substrate. therefore, as a suggestion for further
studies, we explored whether the  xxxg758xxx  deletion modified the
effect of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  among those with low ␣- xxxd2490xxx 
intake. in the costa rican population, the lowest intake is found
among those that use palm oil for cooking, because palm oil does
not contain ␣- xxxd2490xxx . interestingly, we found a significant
interaction (p value for interaction ҃ 0.047) between  xxxg758xxx 
genotype, ␣- xxxd2490xxx  in adipose tissue, and the risk of mi
among palm oil users, suggesting that at low intakes of
␣- xxxd2490xxx , the protective effect of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  is attenuated among carriers of the variant allele. further research in
populations with low intake of ␣- xxxd2490xxx  and very-longchain nҁ3  xxxd2154xxx  is warranted.
although there are no available epidemiologic studies on the
 xxxg758xxx  gene, there is one case report in a patient with an inborn

error of lipid metabolism (38). in this case, severe clinical symptoms described ⌬6-desaturase deficiency (for example, 80% decrease in gene transcription) that was attributed to an insertion of
a thymidine in the transcriptional regulatory region of the gene
(38). because this is the same allele that we found in 52% of the
participants in our population (who do not present any clinical
symptoms as described), it is possible that the allele identified by
nwankwo et al (38) was not responsible for the severe clinical
phenotype described. most likely, the high frequency of the t
allele resulted in a spurious link to the phenotype, given that only
3 controls were evaluated.
the strengths of our study include the high participation rate in
cases and population-based controls, the availability of fatty acid
composition from both adipose tissue and plasma, and the use of
biomarkers to assess dietary intake. as in all observational studies, we could not establish a causal relation; however, the consistency of our findings in 2 different tissues makes our hypothesis plausible, and our results were not likely to be confounded by
diet, age, sex, area of residence, or bmi. however, it is possible
that the t/- deletion is in linkage disequilibrium with other functional snps in the  xxxg758xxx  gene. because several fatty acid concentrations were assessed, multiple comparisons may be another
limitation of the study. however, we limited the fatty acid comparisons to our a priori hypothesis, and the consistency of the
association in both tissues makes chance an unlikely explanation
for the findings. further studies on this polymorphism and others
in the  xxxg758xxx  gene are warranted to reassess the effect of nҁ3
and nҁ6 pufa on ihd. these future studies will be of special
importance in those populations in which the intake of
␣- xxxd2490xxx  and very-long-chain nҁ3  xxxd2154xxx  from fish
(epa and dha) is very low.
