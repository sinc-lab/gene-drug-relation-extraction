modulation of the firing activity of rat serotonin and
noradrenaline neurons by (6) xxxd2957xxx 
nasser haddjeri, claude de montigny, and pierre blier
background: (6) xxxd2957xxx  is a b-adrenergic/ xxxg1108xxx  antagonist used in combination with certain antidepressant drugs to accelerate the onset of the antidepressive response.
methods: the aim of the present study was to assess,
using an in vivo electrophysiologic paradigm, the effect of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  on the spontaneous firing activity of rat
dorsal raphe serotonin (5-ht) and locus coeruleus noradrenaline (na) neurons.
results: (6) xxxd2957xxx  did not modify the firing activity of
dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons at low doses (10 and 200
mg/kg, iv), but it prevented the suppressant effect of the
5-ht autoreceptor agonist  xxxd2527xxx 
(lsd, 10 mg/kg, iv) but not that of the  xxxg1108xxx 
8-hydroxy-n,n-dipropyl-aminotetralin (8-ohdpat, 5 mg/
kg, iv). at a higher dose (500 mg/kg, iv), (6) xxxd2957xxx 
decreased 5-ht neuronal firing and this effect was reversed by the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way
100635 (100 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that it could act as a
partial 5-ht1a autoreceptor agonist. in the locus coeruleus, the high dose of (6) xxxd2957xxx  decreased the firing
activity of na neurons and this effect was reversed by the
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonist mdl 100907 (200 mg/kg, iv).
finally, both a lesion of na neurons and the administration of mdl 100907 prevented the suppressant effect of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing of 5-ht neurons.
conclusions: it is suggested that, at low doses, (6) xxxd2957xxx  acts as a somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptor
antagonist whereas at a higher dose, it decreases the tonic
excitatory input from na neurons to 5-ht neurons. biol

(5-ht) system in the therapeutic effect of antidepressant
treatments (blier and de montigny 1994; maes and meltzer 1995). various classes of antidepressant treatments
enhance 5-ht neurotransmission with a time course that is
consistent with their delayed therapeutic effect. this
would be mediated via different mechanisms such as
postsynaptic sensitization to 5-ht, desensitization of the
somatodendritic and/or terminal 5-ht autoreceptors, or a
desensitization of a2-adrenergic heteroreceptors located
on 5-ht terminals (see for review blier and de montigny
1994). a new strategy to potentiate the antidepressant
response of medications acting on the presynaptic component consists in combining the arylalkylamine (6) xxxd2957xxx , which is a b-adrenergic/ xxxg1108xxx  antagonist,
with a selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor (ssri), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi), or a  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist from the beginning of a treatment to obtain a more
rapid onset of antidepressant action. although negative
results have been reported (berman et al 1997), there are
now six placebo-controlled studies showing that this
approach can exert a rapid onset of action, and in some
cases, a greater efficacy in major depression (see blier and
bergeron 1998 for review; bordet et al 1998; perez et al
1997; maes et al 1996; tome et al 1997; zanardi et al
1997, 1998). accordingly, preclinical studies have shown
that (6) xxxd2957xxx  can potentiate the effects of ssris on
extracellular 5-ht concentration by preventing the activation of somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors, but not
those located at the postsynaptic level (romero et al 1996;
tada et al 1998). however, (2) xxxd2957xxx  possesses a weak
partial agonist activity at human 5-ht1a receptors (newman-tancredi et al 1998) and it has been shown that its
intravenous administration dose-dependently suppresses
the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons in freelymoving cats (fornal et al 1997). given these apparently
discordant observations, the present studies were undertaken
to characterize the effects of acute administration (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing activity of dorsal raphe (dr) 5-ht and locus
coeruleus (lc) noradrenaline (na) neurons, using in vivo
electrophysiologic paradigms in anesthetized rats.

methods and materials
the experiments were carried out in male sprague-dawley rats
weighing 250 to 300 g, which were kept under standard labora0006-3223/99/$20.00

tory conditions (12:12 light– dark cycle with free access to food
and water). they were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400
mg/kg, ip) and supplemental doses were given to maintain
constant anesthesia, monitored by the absence of nociceptive
reaction to a tail pinch.

extracellular recordings from dorsal raphe 5-ht
neurons
unitary extracellular recordings of 5-ht neurons were performed with single-barrelled glass micropipettes preloaded with
fibreglass filaments in order to facilitate filling. the tip was
broken back to 2 to 4 mm and filled with a 2 mol/l nacl solution
saturated with fast green fcf. the burr hole was drilled 1 mm
anterior to lambda on midline. dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons were
encountered over a distance of 1 mm starting immediately below
the ventral border of the sylvius aqueduct. these neurons were
identified using the following criteria: a slow (0.5 to 2.5 hz) and
regular firing rate and long-duration (0.8 to 1.2 ms) positive
action potentials. the effect of iv administration (6) xxxd2957xxx 
(10, 200, and 500 mg/kg) on the firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-ht
neurons was assessed prior to the iv injection of the 5-ht
autoreceptor agonist lsd (10 mg/kg, iv), of the selective
 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way 100635 (100 mg/kg, iv), prior
to the iv injection of the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-oh-dpat
(5 mg/kg, iv), and prior to and after the selective 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist mdl 100907 (200 mg/kg, iv). the effect of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons was
also determined in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) lesioned rats.
lesion of na neurons was performed under chloral hydrate
anesthesia by injecting 6-ohda intracerebroventricularly (120
mg free base in 20 ml of .9% nacl and .1%  xxxd228xxx ) 1 h
after the injection of the 5-ht reuptake blocker fluoxetine (10
mg/kg, ip) to protect 5-ht neurons. the rats were tested 10 days
later. the same volume of vehicle was injected in control rats.

extracellular recordings from locus coeruleus
(lc) na neurons
lc na neurons were also recorded with single-barrelled glass
micropipettes at the following stereotaxic coordinates: 2.7 mm
posterior to lambda and 1.1 to 1.4 mm lateral. noradrenaline
neurons were identified by their regular firing rate (1 to 5 hz),
long-duration (0.8 to 1.2 ms) positive action potentials, and their
characteristic burst discharge in response to nociceptive pinch of
the contralateral hind paw. the effect of iv administration
(6) xxxd2957xxx  (500 mg/kg) on the spontaneous firing activity of lc
na neurons was assessed prior to the iv injection of the
selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist mdl 100907 (200 mg/kg,
iv).

drugs
drugs used were (6) xxxd2957xxx , way 100635 (research biochemicals, natick, ma, usa); mdl 100907 (hoechst marion
roussel, cincinnati, oh, usa);  xxxd2135xxx  (eli lilly,
indianapolis, in, usa); and mirtazapine (organon, oss, the
netherlands). the concentrations and the doses used for these

compounds were chosen on the basis of previous successful
experiments carried out in our and other laboratories.

results
it has been clearly demonstrated that 5-ht neuron firing
activity is dependent on the activation of somatodendritic
5-ht1a autoreceptors as well as on the tonic activation by
its noradrenegic input (baraban and aghajanian, 1980;
blier and de montigny 1987). accordingly, and as illustrated in figure 1a, the iv administration of the 5-ht
autoreceptor agonist lsd (10 mg/kg, iv) suppressed the
firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons, and this suppressant
effect was reversed by the selective  xxxg1108xxx 
antagonist way 100635 (100 mg/kg, iv). (6) xxxd2957xxx , at
doses of 10 and 200 mg/kg did not modify the firing
activity of dr 5-ht neurons (22 6 2% for a dose of 10
mg/kg, n 5 7 and 21 6 3% for a dose of 200 mg/kg, n 5
13) but significantly attenuated the suppressant effect of
lsd (figure 1b, c, and d). interestingly, (6) xxxd2957xxx  at
a dose of 200 mg/kg (n 5 6), did not prevent or reverse
the suppressant effect of a dose of 8-oh-dpat (5 mg/kg,
iv, n 5 7), which completely shuts off neuronal firing
(figure 2a and b). on the other hand, 500 mg/kg of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  by itself reduced the firing activity of 5-ht
neurons by about 50% (figure 3a and c). as exemplified
in figure 3a, this suppressant effect of (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the
firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons, which appeared with
a short latency (,60 s), was reversed in all cases by the
subsequent iv administration of way 100635 (100 mg/
kg, n 5 5) but not that of the selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist mdl 100907 (200 mg/kg). finally, mdl
100907 (200 mg/kg, iv) did not modify by itself 5-ht
neuronal firing but prevented suppressant effect of (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons (prior to:
47 6 14%, n 5 7; after mdl 100907: 7 6 14%, n 5 6,
p , .03).
it was previously reported that (2) xxxd2957xxx  decreased
the firing activity of lc na neurons when given at a dose
of 15 mg/kg, ip (haddjeri et al 1997). to determine a
possible involvement of na neurons in the suppressant
effect of (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing activity of dr 5-ht
neurons at the doses mentioned above, the lesioning of na
neurons was performed using the neurotoxin 6-ohda. as
illustrated in figure 3b and c, the suppressant effect of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  on the spontaneous firing activity of dr 5-ht
neurons was markedly and significantly attenuated by the
6-ohda pretreatment.
finally, the effect of (6) xxxd2957xxx  (500 mg/kg) administered systemically was investigated on electrophysiologically identified lc na neurons. a dose of 500 mg/kg of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  reduced the firing activity of na neurons by
54 6 12% (n 5 8). in contrast to dr 5-ht neurons, this

modify the firing activity of 5-ht neurons but prevented
the suppressant effect of lsd, suggesting that (6) xxxd2957xxx 
antagonized somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors in the
dr. however, a high dose of (6) xxxd2957xxx  (500 mg/kg, iv)
reduced the spontaneous firing activity of both dr 5-ht

n. haddjeri et al

and lc na neurons. this suppressant effect of (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons was
reversed by way 100635 (100 mg/kg, iv), suggesting
that (6) xxxd2957xxx  could act as a partial 5-ht1a autoreceptor; however, this inhibitory action was abolished by a
6-ohda pretreatment, indicating that the na system is
involved in the suppressant effect of (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the
spontaneous firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons.
 xxxd2957xxx  interacts with 5-ht1a receptors with nanomolar affinity (ki 5 8 nmol/l in recombinant human 5-ht1a
receptors using (2) xxxd2957xxx  and ki 5 13 nmol/l in rat
hippocampal membranes using (6) xxxd2957xxx  (hoyer and
schoeffter 1991; nénonéné et al 1996; newman-tancredi
et al 1998); and prevents some biologic responses mediated via  xxxg1108xxx  activation (aulakh et al 1988;
lesch et al 1990; seletti et al 1995). one peculiar
characteristic found with this ligand is its preferential
activity at the presynaptic  xxxg1108xxx . in vitro, it has
been previously demonstrated that 1 mmol/l (6) xxxd2957xxx 
antagonizes the inhibitory effect of gepirone on the firing
activity of rat dr 5-ht neurons (gehlbach and vandermaelen 1987). in vivo, it has been also shown that a 2-day
treatment with (2) xxxd2957xxx  (15 mg/kg/day, sc) prevents
the inhibitory effect of lsd on rat dr 5-ht neuronal
firing activity as well as the reduction of firing activity
observed after a 2-day treatment with the ssri paroxetine,
thus supporting its antagonistic property for dr somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors. however, using the latter
regimen, (2) xxxd2957xxx  did not antagonize postsynaptic
5-ht1a receptors mediating the suppression of firing of
dorsal hippocampus ca3 pyramidal neurons recorded
extracellularly (romero et al 1996; haddjeri et al 1998b),
further suggesting the existence of pharmacologically
distinct subpopulations of 5-ht1a receptors (blier et al
1993; hadrava et al 1994). nevertheless, in vitro, an
antagonistic activity of (6) xxxd2957xxx  for postsynaptic
5-ht1a receptors on ca1–ca3 pyramidal neurons has
been reported (corradetti et al 1998). in the present
studies, both lsd and 8-oh-dpat have been used to
activate somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors in the dr
and (6) xxxd2957xxx  prevented only the suppressant effect of
lsd on the firing activity of 5-ht neurons. it has been
recently shown that (6) xxxd2957xxx  (0.1 to 1 mg/kg, iv) fails
to antagonize the suppressant effect of 8-oh-dpat (10
mg/kg, iv) on the firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons in
freely moving cats (fornal et al 1997). as previously
proposed (blier and de montigny 1987), the latter discrepancy between the effects of lsd and 8-oh-dpat could
be explained by the existence of a negative feedback loop.
in fact, the iv administration of 8-oh-dpat would
activate postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors located on neurons, possibly in the medial prefrontal cortex, which exert
a negative feedback influence on dr 5-ht neurons (blier
and de montigny 1987; ceci et al 1994; hajos et al 1998).
thus, (6) xxxd2957xxx  (200 mg/kg, iv) would be unable to

(6) xxxd2957xxx  and rat dorsal raphe nucleus

antagonize the effect of 8-oh-dpat because (6) xxxd2957xxx 
may not antagonize this postsynaptic  xxxg1108xxx  as is
the case in the dorsal hippocampus. in contrast, both
(6) xxxd2957xxx  and way 100635 antagonized the suppressant effect of lsd on the firing activity of dr 5-ht
neurons because both antagonists are effective on the
somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors.
in recent years, numerous studies have documented
several interactions between na and 5-ht systems. it is
well established that na neurons modulate the activity of
the 5-ht system and there are several lines of evidence
supporting the notion that the 5-ht system also influences
brain na neurons (see haddjeri et al 1997). using the
potent and selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way
100635 (fletcher et al 1996), the involvement of 5-ht1a
receptors in the modulation of lc na neurons by the
5-ht system was recently described. way 100635 suppressed the firing activity of na neurons and this inhibitory effect was abolished by lesioning 5-ht neurons. it
has been concluded that the suppressant effect of way
100635 on the firing activity of lc na neurons was due
to an enhancement of the function of 5-ht neurons via a
presynaptic  xxxg1108xxx  which is, however, not the
somatodendritic one since the dose of way 100635 used
in these experiments did not alter 5-ht neuronal activity.
in contrast, the postsynaptic 5-ht receptor mediating this
effect of way 100635 on na neurons appears to be of the
5-ht2a subtype, as indicated by antagonism of 5-ht2a
receptors (haddjeri et al 1997). since (2) xxxd2957xxx  (15
mg/kg, ip) attenuated the firing activity of lc na neurons
in the latter study, the possibility that (6) xxxd2957xxx  could
act in part via na neurons had to be taken into account in
the present work (figure 2). in the present study, the high
dose of (6) xxxd2957xxx  (500 mg/kg, iv) indeed suppressed
the firing activity of both dr 5-ht and lc na neurons,
and the lesion of na neurons with the neurotoxin
6-ohda nearly abolished the suppressant effect of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons.
these results suggest that the suppressant effect of the
high dose of (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing activity of dr 5-ht
neurons could be due, at least in part, to a decrease of the
tonic excitatory input from na neurons. it is worth
mentioning that the lesion of na neurons with the neurotoxin 6-ohda decreases the firing activity of 5-ht
neurons for the first few days, but after 4 to 7 days their
normal pattern of firing is restored (svensson et al 1975).
this clearly indicates that 5-ht neurons adapt in the
presence of an impaired na activation. the reason why
the suppressant effect of the high dose of (6) xxxd2957xxx  was
prevented by the lesion of the na neurons remains
elusive. however, one possibility could be a permissive
role of normal lc neuronal firing. as mentioned, it has
been shown that the suppressant effect of way 100635

biol psychiatry

1167

(100 mg/kg, iv) on the firing activity of lc na neuronal
firing was due to an enhancement of the function of 5-ht
neurons via a presynaptic  xxxg1108xxx  and that the
postsynaptic 5-ht receptor mediating this effect of way
100635 on na neurons was of the 5-ht2a subtype
(haddjeri et al 1997). similarly, mdl 100907 could have
prevented the suppressant effect of the high dose of
(6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing activity of dr 5-ht neurons by
preventing an attenuation of the lc neuronal firing. on the
other hand, fornal et al (1997) recently reported in awake
cats that systemic administration of both (6) and (2) xxxd2957xxx  suppressed the firing activity dorsal raphe 5-ht
neurons and this effect was reversed by way 100635.
this result implies that (6) xxxd2957xxx  can act as an agonist
at 5-ht1a autoreceptors and this assumption was confirmed (clifford et al 1998; present studies). this appears
inconsistent with a potentiation of the firing activity of
5-ht neurons by (2) xxxd2957xxx  in combination with ssris
(romero et al 1996). the present studies, however, put
into evidence a biphasic effect of (6) xxxd2957xxx  on the firing
activity of dr 5-ht neurons. although still speculative,
the low intravenous doses, which did not affect the
neuronal firing activity and prevented 5-ht1a autoreceptor activation, might be similar to the sustained subcutaneous administration of 15 mg/kg/day used by romero et
al (1996). it is possible that low doses of (6) xxxd2957xxx 
might exert an enhancing effect on 5-ht neurotransmission by acting on neuronal elements outside the raphe
nuclei. the critical role of the concentration of (6) xxxd2957xxx  can be further emphasized by recent studies, using
different models in humans (e.g., body temperature and
cortisol levels) showing that (6) xxxd2957xxx  at a high dose
(30 mg p.o.) behaves as a  xxxg1108xxx  agonist per se
but prevents the full effect of subsequent administration of
an agonist (seletti et al 1995; meltzer and maes 1996;
haddjeri et al 1998a). furthermore, (2) xxxd2957xxx , but not
the partial  xxxg1108xxx  agonist buspirone, potentiates
the actions of ssris in facilitating 5-ht release (romero
et al 1996; hjorth and auerbach 1996; gobert et al 1997).
it is also noteworthy that (6) xxxd2957xxx  can also potentiate
the antidepressant response to the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist
buspirone (blier et al 1997). in the light of (6) xxxd2957xxx 
currently being used in combination with several antidepressants to accelerate the onset of the antidepressive
response, further studies, using different concentrations of
the compound, are required to determine whether its
long-term administration could by itself affect 5-ht and
na neurotransmission.
