summary  xxxd84xxx , which is a l-dimethylaminomethyl triazolobenzodiazepine, is an effective
anxiolytic agent as defined by suppression of stress-induced increases in plasma corticostcroids.
 xxxd84xxx  is also an effective antagonist of pentylenetetrazole. the l-dimethylaminoethyl triazolo
analog, u-43,465f, was inactive in the stressed rat test and only weakly active against pentylenetetrazole.
 xxxd84xxx  and u-43,465f have been previously shown to have antidepressant activity in classical
screening tests. they have also been found to potentiate the effect of norepinephrine and this is consistent
with the activity of the known antidepressants; u-43,465f was found to be equieffective to imipramine in
this test.  xxxd84xxx  was also effective; however, the magnitude of the potentiation was not as great. the
uptake of norepinephrine was only weakly affected by either compound. potentiation or uptake of
serotonin were not significantly-altered pharmacological factors. receptor binding studies were negative
except at the benzodiazepine receptor.
chronic treatment with  xxxd84xxx  did not decrease the number of beta-adrencrgic receptors in the
cerebral cortex of the rat, in contrast to the positive effect of imipramine.
the discovery of triazolobenzodiazepines with antidepressant activity is of special interest. these agents
will hopefully have lower toxicity than the tricyclic antidepressants and thus possess a more favourable
therapeutic index. this would be advantageous in the treatment of depression.
key words: benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, norepinephrine, serotonm, receptors.

the tricyclic antidepressant drugs are the most
frequently used drugs for the treatment of depression. the effectiveness of this class of agents in
treating depression is not overwhelming, in that only
50-70% of all depressed patients respond to this
form of therapy (morris and beck, 1974: avery and
wiaokur, 1976). a positive clinical response to this
treatment is seldom very rapid and may take from
2 ,~ weeks before measurable improvement is observed (kline, 1974). the tricyclic antidepressants are
also known for their low therapeutic ratio which
results primarily from cardiovascular-related side
effects (biggs, 1978; burckhardt, raeder, muller,
imhof and neubauer, 1978).
]'he benzodiazepines, in contrast to the tricyclic
antidepressants, have fewer toxic side effects and
consequently have a higher therapeutic ratio. the
triazolobenzodiazepines, such as alprazolam and
triazolam (hester, rudzik and kamdar, 1971), are
very potent agents in the benzodiazepine class and
have the same favorable therapeutic ratio as do the
other benzodiazepines. the broad pharmacological
screening of a series of the triazolobenzodiazepines
resulted in the discovery of agents that showed both
anxiolytic and antidepressant activity (hester, rudzik and vonvoigtlander, 1980).
this report describes the results of additional
studies which were used to evaluate further the
anxiolytic and antidepressant activity of this novel
class of triazolobenzodiazepines (fig. 1). an ab-

stract, describing some of the pharmacological
studies and results of open labelled clinical studies in
severely depressed patients, has already been published (lahti, cohn, feighner, smith and pyke,
1982).

male sprague-dawley rats, weighing 250 350g,
were used throughout. while under  xxxd2604xxx 
anesthesia, the trachea was cannulated and the rat
was pithed and then placed on a respirator. blood
pressure was recorded from a cannula in the carotid
artery via a transducer connected to a grass model
79 polygraph recording at 25 mm/min. vagus nerves
were cut and a cannula was inserted into a femoral
vein to permit the intravenous injection of drugs. all

of [3h]norpinep hrine and

carworth farm male mice, 18-22g, were uscd in
all the studies. drugs were administered to the mice
by the subcutaneous route in a total volume of 0.2 ml
of vehicle. one hour after the drug or vehicle was
injected,
the
mice
were
given
5 ftc of
[3h]norpinephrine and 0.125 pc of [~4c]serotonin,
simultaneously, in a total volume of 0.1 ml of vehicle,
via the intravenous route. three hours after the
labelled drug was administered, two similarly-treated
mice were decapitated and their hearts and spleens
were removed, rinsed and frozen on dry ice. the two
hearts were homogenized in 3.0ml of 0.4n hc10,~,
centrifuged, and a 1.5ml aliquot of the supernatant
was removed, placed in a scintillation vial containing
15ml of the appropriate scintillation fluid and
[3h]nonepinephrine (ne) counted. two spleens
from similarly-treated mice were taken through the
same procedure and an aliquot was counted for
[14cjserotonin. at least two determinations were
made per dose of drug or vehicle (lahti, platz and
mcallister, 1970). preliminary results demonstrated
that the ultilization of this double isotope technique
does not result in any cross contamination, i.e. [3h]ne in spleen or [14c]-5-ht in the heart.

cortieoseroids in the rat (lahti and barsuhn, 1980)
male tuc sprague-dawley rats, weighing approx. 240g, were housed in groups of 5 for several
days prior to each experiment. on the day of the
experiment, the rats were injected at zero hour with
drug or vehicle and one hour later they were given an
intraperitoneal injection of l-5-htp. one hour after
the injection of l-5-htp, the animals were anesthetized with halothane and 4 5 ml of blood withdrawn
via heart puncture with a heparanized syringe.

werc run under identical conditions with regard to
homogenate, incubation and filtration techniques.
the homogenate was prepared by homogenizing a
whole rat brain in 10ml of 0.05mtham hci, ph
7.4, using a brinkman pt10 polytron at setting no. 7
of 30 sec, and centrifuging at 30,000,q tbr 10 rain. i'hc
supernatant was discarded, the pellet resuspended in
10rot buffer using the polytron at setting no. 7 for
10 sec and the centrifugation repeated. the pellet v~.as
resuspended and diluted to 100 times the original
tissue weight with buffer.
the incubation mixture consisted of 2 ml homogehate, 0.1ml ligand and 0.1ml drug solution or
vehicle. the mixture was incubated in a shaking
water bath at 30'c for 30min. after incubation the
samples were filtered on whatman g f b glass
microfibre filters (3.7cm diameter) using porcelain
perlbrated plate funnels and suction flasks operating
under house vacuum. the incubation tubes were
rinsed once and the filters given a triplicate 5 ml rinse
with cold buffer. the filters were then placed in liquid
scintillation counting vials containing 15ml acs
counting fluid and counted in a liquid scintillation
counter.
samples were run in triplicate and values expressed
using specific binding data. non-specific binding for
each ligand was determined by adding an appropriate material at high concentration to determine the
an'1ount of non-displaceable radioactivity (see
below). non-specific binding was subtracted from
total bound material to determine specific binding.
the tritiated ligands were obtained from either ne~

results

the results of the receptor studies (table i)
indicate that  xxxd84xxx  and u-43,465f interacted
with the benzodiazepine receptors. the activity of the
alkyl amine compounds was less than that of
alprazolam or diazepam. the drug, u-43,465f, was
mere active than  xxxd84xxx  in inhibiting the
binding of both [all]ethyl beta-carboline carboxylate
([3h]-ecc) and [3h]flunitrazepam ([3h]- xxxg803xxx ).
chlordiazepoxide was weaker than either u-43,465f

and 3.0mg/kg, respectively). however, u-43,465f,
which was considerably more active than  xxxd84xxx 
in the in vitro studies, was ineffective in the stressed
rat test at doses up to 50 mg/kg (fig. 2).
the anticonvulsant activity of  xxxd84xxx  and u43,465f was tested using the the convulsant, pentylenetetrazol (table 2).  xxxd84xxx  was as effective as
diazepam in this test, whereas u-43,465f was
considerably weaker. the edso's (mg/kg) of 0.02,
0.01 and 20 were obtained for the three agents,
respectively.
antidepressant activity was characterized by
evaluating the two agents for their ability to
potentiate the effect of ne on blood pressure in the
pithed rat preparation (fig. 3). in this test, u43,465f was found to parallel closely the activity of
the classical agent, imipramine; u-43,465f was not
only as potent as imipramine but the magnitude of
the potentiation was as great.  xxxd84xxx , although
less effective than u-43,465f or imipramine, clearly
exerted a potentiation of the activity of n e.
diazepam, in contrast, did not cause a significant
potentiation of ne at doses up to i mg/kg (i.v.).
blockade of the uptake of ne and 5-ht was
evaluated using established uptake procedures in the
mouse (table 3). both  xxxd84xxx  and u-43,465f

discussion
the anxiolytic and antidepressant activity of the
triazolobenzodiazepines which had been previously
observed in preliminary screening tests (hester et al.,
1980) was confirmed in certain cases in the present
study previous studies showed that  xxxd84xxx  and
u-43,465f were effective agents in the classical
antidepressant tests such as antagonism of oxotremorine-induced hypothermia, potentiation of
yohimbine-aggregation toxicity, and potentiation of
apomorphine-induced gnawing.
adnazolam and u-43,465f, which differ in the
length of the substituted alkyl amino side chain by
one methylene group (fig. 1) had differing pharmacologmal properties.  xxxd84xxx  was very effective
in amagonizing penetylenetetrazole-induced convulsions and stress-induced elevations in plasma corticostmoids in the rat. on the other hand, u-43,465f
was relatively weak in antagonizing pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions and did not block stressinduced increases in corticosteroid levels as do most
anxiolytic agents (lahti and barsuhn, 1974). the in
vivo data described above were not in agreement with
the in vitro receptor binding studies where u-43,465f
was considerably more effective than  xxxd84xxx  in
inhibiting the binding of both [3h]ethyl beta-carboline carboxylate and [-~h]flunitrazepam. the discrepa:acy between the in vitro and in vivo data may be
relatej to differences in drug metabolism or
transport.
the potentiating effect of u-43,465f on the
actions of ne very closely paralleled the activity of
the classical tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine.
 xxxd84xxx  was also effective in small doses, but the
degree of potentiation was not as great as that
observed with u-43,465f and imipramine. diazepam
was ineffective in potentiating the effect of ne on
blood pressure.
the two triazolobenzodiazepines were found to be

very weak or ineffective at blocking the uptake of
[3h]-ne into the mouse heart or of [14c]serotonin
into the mouse spleen. however, it has previously
been reported (lahti and maickel, 1971) that there is
a poor correlation between the blockade of uptake of
ne and other parameters, such as clinical antidepressant activity and potentiation of the actions of
ne.
the effect of the triazolobenzodiazepine derivatives on uptake of serotonin and potentiation of the
effects of l-5-htp was extremely weak or nonexistent. those results were unlike the reported
effects of agents such as fluoxetine,  xxxd3555xxx  and
misanserin on the effect of l-5-htp.
the results from the multiple ligand binding
studies indicate that  xxxd84xxx  and u-43,465f are
unlike imipramine in several important aspects. they
do not affect alpha-adrenergic binding, anticholinergic systems, antipsychotic binding sites, nor the
serotonergic receptors, as does imipramine. this lack
of activity may be a reflection of a weaker potential
to produce certain side effects in the cardiovascular
and anticholinergic areas.  xxxd84xxx  and u43,465f, in contrast to imipramine, were not active
in inhibiting the binding of the antidepressant,
[3h] xxxd2637xxx . this may indicate a different mode
of antidepressant action.
chronic treatment with  xxxd84xxx  did not reduce
beta-adrenergic receptor binding in the cerebral
cortex of rats as did imipramine and other antidepressants (sethy and harris, 1981). however,
chronic (14 day), but not acute (5 day), treatment of
rats with  xxxd84xxx  did result in a selective increase
in the inhibitory response of hippocampal neurons to
microiontophoretically applied serotonin (personal
communication, c. demontigny). this effect has
been shown for several other antidepressants
(demontigny and aghajanian, 1978).
two triazolobenzodiazepine derivatives have been
extensively evaluated for their anxiolytic and antidepressant activity. the positioning of an alkyl
amine side chain at the 1-position conferred antidepressant activity onto the triazolobenzodiazepine
structure (fig. 1). when the alkyl amine side chain
was 1 carbon long, the compound,  xxxd84xxx ,
exhibited anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and antidepressant properties. extending the side chain to 2 carbons

r.a. lahti {'t el/.

resulted in an a p p a r e n t loss of anxiolytic activity,
considerably diminished a n t i c o n v u l s a n t activity, but
the antidepressant effects seemed strengthened.
the discovery of triazolobenzodiazepines with
antidepressant properties is most encouraging. it is
hoped that these agents will exhibit less cardiovascular toxicity t h a n the tricyclic antidepressants
and consequently have a more favorable therapeutic
index in depressed patients. in addition,  xxxd84xxx ,
which appears to have both anxiolytic a n d antidepressant activity', may not only be useful in
depression, but in mixed anxiety depression states as
well.
initial clinical results indicate that  xxxd84xxx  is
an effective antidepressant in severe depression and
may represent a m a j o r b r e a k t h r o u g h in safety a n d
efficacy in the treatment of depression (lahti et al.,
1982).
