discovery and development of the complement
inhibitor eculizumab for the treatment of
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
russell p rother1, scott a rollins1, christopher f mojcik1, robert a brodsky2 & leonard bell1
the complement system provides critical immunoprotective
and immunoregulatory functions but uncontrolled complement
activation can lead to severe pathology. in the rare hemolytic
disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh), somatic
mutations result in a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked surface proteins, including the terminal
complement inhibitor cd59, on hematopoietic stem cells.
in a dysfunctional bone marrow background, these mutated
progenitor blood cells expand and populate the periphery.
deficiency of cd59 on pnh red blood cells results in chronic
complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis, a process
central to the morbidity and mortality of pnh. a recently
developed, humanized monoclonal antibody directed against
complement component c5, eculizumab ( xxxd1963xxx ; alexion
pharmaceuticals inc., cheshire, ct, usa), blocks the
proinflammatory and cytolytic effects of terminal complement
activation. the recent approval of eculizumab as a first-in-class
complement inhibitor for the treatment of pnh validates the
concept of complement inhibition as an effective therapy and
provides rationale for investigation of other indications in which
complement plays a role.
the complement system: a potential target for therapeutics
the complement system consists of more than 20 serum proteins that
interact in a precise series of enzymatic cleavage and membrane binding
events leading to the generation of products with immunoprotective,
immunoregulatory, proinflammatory and cytolytic properties1,2.
proximal complement. the cascade proceeds through three distinct
pathways—alternative, classical and lectin—which all result in the generation of c3 convertase complexes that mediate the cleavage of c3 to
 xxxg282xxx  and c3b1,3 (fig. 1). recent studies have delineated the structure
of c3 and c3 fragments and provided important insights into their

function4–7. the classical pathway is generally initiated by the interaction of c1q with antigen-antibody complexes. the lectin pathway is
activated by the interaction of  xxxg1382xxx  (mbl) with
specific mannose-containing carbohydrate structures. the alternative
pathway is initiated by deposition of preformed c3b on a variety of
substrates such as bacteria and cell membranes, including erythrocytes. this c3b is continuously available due to the interaction of c3
with water, a process that represents an important part of the innate
immune system called complement ‘tick-over’. in addition to its role in
the initiation of alternative pathway activation, c3b is also necessary for
the amplification and progression of the complement cascade through
all pathways of activation and serves as a key immunoprotective and
immunoregulatory molecule.
the importance of proximal complement components in immunity is
illustrated by the clinical effects observed in people with genetic complement deficiencies. for example, individuals with c3 deficiency are at
particular risk of infection from polysaccharide-coated bacteria such as
streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis, and frequently die at a young age from overwhelming sepsis8. the
absence of c3 is generally thought to prevent the progression of complement through all pathways of activation, thereby reducing the body’s
ability to opsonize pathogens and mount an inflammatory response,
although some studies suggest that c5 cleavage can occur in the absence
of c3 by thrombin3,9. individuals deficient in c1, c2 or c4 develop severe
autoimmune symptoms such as a lupus-like syndrome and are also susceptible to recurrent overwhelming sepsis. thus, deficiencies in early
components of the complement cascade lead to impairment in the ability
to generate c3b, which is critical for immune complex clearance and is
the primary opsonin for many pathogenic microorganisms.
terminal complement. all pathways of complement activation converge at the cleavage of c5 into c5a and  xxxg285xxx  by the c5 convertase
enzyme complexes. this cleavage event initiates the terminal complement cascade (fig. 1). c5a is a potent anaphylatoxin that mediates
leukocyte chemotaxis, increases vascular permeability, alters smooth
muscle tone and induces secondary inflammatory mediators such as
hydrolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen species,  xxxd208xxx  metabolites and cytokines10. c5a receptors are present on a variety of cell types
that directly contribute to inflammation, including monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. the c5a receptor cd88 is a member of the
n-formyl peptide receptor family, which transduces signals through a g
protein–dependent pathway resulting in biochemical proinflammatory

development of eculizumab
to generate potent inhibitors of complement
component c5, panels of murine anti-human
c5 monoclonal antibodies were generated
and initially screened for the ability to inhibit
tcc-mediated lysis of antibody-sensitized
chicken erythrocytes by human complement
in a standard hemolytic assay16. the most
potent candidates were cloned and purified,
and functional activity was further characterized to identify anti-c5 antibodies that could
also effectively block the generation of c5a. of
~30,000 hybridomas screened, one monoclonal antibody (mab), designated murine  xxxd1963xxx 
(m5g1.1 mab), was identified that effectively
blocked both tcc-mediated hemolysis and
the generation of c5a, at a 0.5:1 molar ratio
of antibody to c5. murine  xxxd1963xxx  mab binding to human c5 mapped to the n-terminal
region of the alpha chain.

figure 1 targeted blockade of complement protein c5. the complement cascade can be activated
via the classical, lectin and alternative pathways. the proximal components of complement (proteins
upstream of c5) are essential for microbial opsonization and immune complex clearance. all pathways
of complement activation converge at the cleavage of the terminal complement protein c5 leading to
the generation of molecules with proinflammatory and cell lytic properties. targeted blockade at c5
with eculizumab therefore prevents the deleterious properties of terminal complement activation while
preserving the immunoprotective and immunoregulatory functions of proximal complement. m/o,

responses11. a second c5a receptor has been identified (c5l2) that
also facilitates c5a-mediated signaling in a variety of cell types 12.
 xxxg285xxx  recruits the terminal complement components c6, c7, c8 and
c9 to form  xxxg285xxx -9 or the terminal complement complex (tcc) on
the surface of cells. the generation of the tcc at sublytic concentrations stimulates the release of many of the same proinflammatory
molecules described for c5a. most importantly, unimpeded assembly
of the tcc on the cell surface results in cell lysis. deposition of tcc
on erythrocytes results in the destruction of these cells in hemolytic
diseases such as pnh13,14.
the importance of terminal complement components in immunity is demonstrated by individuals with genetic deficiencies of c5,
c6, c7, c8 or c9, who show an increased incidence of infections with
n. meningitidis, a bacterium that can cause meningitis8. vaccines
against n. meningitidis are recommended for terminal complement–deficient individuals, although breakthrough infections have
been reported15. interestingly, n. meningitidis infections in terminal
complement–deficient people are typically less severe than in normal
individuals, possibly due to the lack of tcc-mediated endotoxin
release from the bacteria15.
targeted blockade of the complement cascade at c5. in the rational
design of a therapeutic complement inhibitor, c5 is an attractive
target1. because c5 is common to all pathways of complement activation, blockade at this point stops the progression of the cascade
regardless of the stimuli. in addition, prevention of c5 cleavage effectively blocks the generation of the potent proinflammatory molecule c5a and the cell lytic tcc. importantly, c5 blockade preserves
the critical immunoprotective and immunoregulatory functions of
upstream components that culminate in c3b-mediated opsonization
and immune complex clearance.

engineering. to reduce the potential for
immunogenicity, we cloned and grafted the
complementarity-determining regions of
m5g1.1 mab into human heavy and light
chain antibody frameworks (fig. 2)16,17. the
human heavy-chain framework was derived
from the h20c3h antibody variable region18,
which contained no amino acid changes relative to the original germline sequence. the
human light-chain framework was derived from the i.23 antibody
variable region19, which contained only one amino acid change from
the original germline sequence; the germline amino acid residue was
restored at this position. the use of purely germline framework acceptor sequences should further minimize potential immunogenicity of the
humanized antibody, because the immune system of every individual
should be tolerant to these sequences.
the use of antibodies as therapeutics in some clinical settings is complicated by effector functions of such antibodies that serve to activate
complement and/or to bind to antibody receptors (fc receptors) on
inflammatory cells after they have engaged their target. to reduce the
potential for eculizumab to elicit proinflammatory responses, we replaced
the heavy-chain constant region of the parental antibody with components of both human igg2 and igg4 constant regions (fig. 2)20. the
human igg2 antibody isotype does not bind fc receptors21,22, whereas
the human igg4 isotype does not activate the complement cascade23,24.
the igg2/igg4 hybrid constant region of eculizumab includes the ch1
and hinge regions of human igg2 fused to the ch2 and ch3 regions
of human igg4, and lacks the ability to bind fc receptor and to activate complement20. to avoid the generation of an antigenic site during
the fusion, we used a restriction endonuclease cleavage site common
to both igg2 and igg4 to join the two constant regions. indeed, a total
of 31 amino acids flanking the fusion site are identical between igg2
and igg4.
binding characteristics. the humanized monoclonal antibody eculizumab maintained its ability to block the cleavage of c5 during
complement activation as the antibody potently inhibited both the generation of c5a and  xxxg285xxx -9–mediated human serum hemolytic activity16.
eculizumab is highly species-restricted, with minimal activity against

binding of eculizumab to any human tissue
examined in a tissue cross-reactivity study
was observed. in addition, the affinity of
eculizumab for human c5 (kd = 120 pm) is
similar to that of the parental m5g1.1-mab,
indicating that the binding properties of the
antibody were not compromised during the
humanization process.
the eculizumab pharmacokinetic profile was
analyzed using a one-compartmental model.
when administered by intravenous infusion,
eculizumab has a half-life of 272 ± 82 h, and its
distribution appears to be primarily limited to
the vascular space. eculizumab serum concentrations appear to reach steady state after ~57
days. at steady state, the eculizumab accumulation ratio (racc) was calculated to be 1.075,
which is indicative of minimal accumulation
over time. pharmacodynamic activity correlates
directly with eculizumab serum concentrations
and maintenance of trough levels above 35 µg/
ml results in essentially complete blockade of
hemolytic activity in vivo25.

2 engineering of eculizumab to reduce immunogenicity and eliminate effector functions. to
minimize immunogenicity, we grafted murine complementarity-determining regions into human heavy
and light chain germline antibody framework sequences. additionally, human igg2 and igg4 heavy
chain sequences were combined to form a hybrid constant region that is unable to bind fc receptors
or to activate the complement cascade. eculizumab exhibits high affinity for human c5, effectively
blocking its cleavage and downstream proinflammatory and cell lytic properties.

preclinical development. because of the species-restricted nature of eculizumab, pharmacological activities in vivo were explored with a
surrogate anti-mouse c5 antibody (bb5.1) that
demonstrated terminal complement–inhibitory
activity comparable to that of eculizumab. as no adequate mouse models
of pnh exist, in vivo studies targeting other therapeutic indications with
potential involvement of terminal complement activation were used. in
a collagen-induced model of arthritis, bb5.1 was shown to prevent the
onset of disease and to improve the course of previously established disease26. treatment with bb5.1 also resulted in an improvement in renal
disease and in dramatic prolongation of survival in a lupus-like autoimmune model27. these models provided substantial evidence that a
functionally blocking anti-c5 antibody could effectively and consistently
block terminal complement activation leading to a reduction in terminal
complement-mediated proinflammatory sequelae. the surrogate bb5.1
antibody was also used in mouse toxicity studies in which no compoundrelated mortalities or significant abnormalities were observed.

early clinical development. initial human clinical studies of eculizumab, and a single-chain antibody variant of eculizumab called pexelizumab, were performed in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and
systemic lupus erythematosus28,29 and in individuals with coronary
artery bypass graft surgery and myocardial infarction, respectively30,31.
the initial eculizumab studies served two purposes, to determine a
dosing schedule for future trials and to establish initial safety of terminal complement inhibition in humans. participants received a single
dose of eculizumab ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg; all doses were
observed to be safe and well-tolerated. the 8 mg/kg dose (~600 mg
total) provided complete complement blockade for 7–14 days. studies
exploring multiple chronic dose regimens with eculizumab were also
performed in individuals with membranous nephritis and rheumatoid
arthritis32,33.
pnh—a disease in search of a complement inhibitor
etiology of pnh. pnh is a rare form of hemolytic anemia with an estimated incidence of 1.3 cases per million per year and a prevalence of

15.9 cases per million34. the disease is manifest by an acquired genetic
deficiency of endogenous complement inhibitors on the surface of
blood cells; these cells are referred to as the pnh clone(s). pnh clones
are deficient in proteins that are normally linked to the cell surface
by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchor. the inability of
cells to attach proteins through this lipid moiety is caused by somatic
mutations occurring in the x-linked gene, phosphatidylinositol glycan–complementation class a (piga)35–37, a critical molecule in the
gpi-anchoring pathway.
in individuals with pnh, cells deficient in gpi-anchored proteins
exist in all blood lineages including erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid
cells. these pnh cells are clonal and harbor matching piga mutations
indicating that the mutations occur in multipotent hematopoietic stem
cells38,39. granulocytes from the blood of healthy controls also possess piga mutations at an exceedingly low frequency (~1 in 50,000),
suggesting that random mutations in this gene are important in the
pathogenesis of pnh40. thus, it has been hypothesized that the development of pnh requires two independent events to occur; hematopoietic stem cells must acquire a piga mutation and an immune attack
that preferentially targets normal stem cells must be present41,42. this
proposal presumes that the bone marrow insult targets a gpi-anchored
protein on the hematopoietic stem cell, thereby providing a survival
advantage to gpi-anchoring–deficient stem cells (that is, cells possessing a piga mutation). it should be noted however that piga mutations
characterized in healthy controls appear to occur in more differentiated colony-forming cells rather than multipotent hematopoietic stem
cells39. these colony-forming cells would not have self-renewal capacity
and therefore would not be propagated beyond their terminally differentiated progeny.
there is clinical evidence to support a survival advantage of piga
mutated hematopoietic stem cell clones over normal stem cells in damaged bone marrow. the mab alemtuzumab (campath) is used to treat

perspective
accepted the application for priority review and in march 2007, less
than 6 months after the completion of shepherd, fda approved
eculizumab for the treatment of patients with pnh to reduce hemolysis. the emea granted review of the eculizumab application under
the accelerated assessment procedure, the fastest evaluation time
frame for full approval awarded by emea. in june 2007, eculizumab
became the first medicinal product to receive approval by the european
commission within the accelerated assessment procedure and it is
indicated for the treatment of patients with pnh.
conclusions and perspectives
clinical development of eculizumab spanned a full decade before its
first approval in the rare, disabling and life-threatening, clonal blood
disorder pnh (fig. 5). the studies before initiation of the pnh clinical
program provided an important assessment of the safety profile and
immunomodulatory effects of eculizumab. once initiated, the pnh
program has been one of the most extensive pre-approval clinical programs for an ‘ultra-orphan’ disease; the design of the multinational
trials enrolling 195 participants allowed sequential, controlled and
long-term evaluation of both biochemical and clinically validated measurements in the pnh population. this paradigm of careful evaluation
may be used in the consideration of eculizumab in other uncommon,
debilitating and life-threatening diseases for which there is evidence
suggesting that terminal complement may significantly contribute
to the pathophysiology of the disease, including antibody-mediated
transplant rejection78, myasthenia gravis and other peripheral neuropathies79–83, fulminant lupus27,29, catastrophic anti-phospholipid
syndrome84,85 and pattern 2 multiple sclerosis86. the understanding
of critical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in pnh
patients and the accomplishment of large-scale commercial manufacturing of eculizumab may also permit the evaluation of new formulations of eculizumab in future development programs for still other
diseases with evidence suggesting complement-mediated pathology,
including asthma87 and age-related macular degeneration88.

clinical trials have demonstrated that eculizumab dramatically and
reproducibly abrogates intravascular hemolysis, the primary clinical
manifestation of pnh. these trials have shown that the reduction in
hemolysis is independently associated with improvements in major
morbidities in individuals with pnh including anemia, fatigue and
health-related quality of life, as well as fewer thrombotic events. because
of the extremely rare nature of the disease and the ethical dilemma
posed by the efficacy evident with eculizumab in the treatment of pnh,
a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is not a feasible means
to examine the long-term impact of eculizumab on survival in individuals with pnh. however, given the evident anti-hemolytic effect
and attendant clinical benefit of eculizumab administration, it is possible that eculizumab could beneficially impact several of the leading
causes of premature mortality in pnh including venous and arterial
thrombosis, hemorrhage that may be worsened by platelet consumption, renal failure and liver failure. in a post hoc analysis of the survival
of eculizumab-treated pnh patients compared to historical controls64,
~15 deaths would have been expected during the 2-year period of eculizumab treatment; however, two deaths were observed during this
period, or 87% fewer than expected (p = 0.0005). this preliminary
analysis suggests that long-term eculizumab treatment may beneficially
affect survival in individuals diagnosed with pnh.
the humanization strategy used to construct eculizumab has resulted
in only very rare evidence of responses to eculizumab, with an incidence
similar to that found with placebo treatment. there is no evidence of
tolerance or a neutralizing antibody response in any treated individual
to date and infusion-related immune effects are similar in frequency
to placebo. it is interesting to speculate that the selection of purely
germline framework acceptor regions, seen as native by all recipients,
has allowed for this important safety benefit.
rigorous evaluation of eculizumab in pnh has helped tease out
the role of hemolysis in mediating critical patient-reported outcomes,
including fatigue and patient functioning. the reproducible demonstration that patient improvement with eculizumab, due to the abrogation

perspective
of the underlying hemolysis, is distinct from associated improvements
in anemia may have applications to understanding the potential
multifactorial etiology of fatigue in individuals with anemia in other
disease settings, such as cancer. similarly, evident improvement in
smooth muscle dystonias and thrombosis with eculizumab treatment
in pnh has helped to establish new and important clinical paradigms,
particularly with regard to the role of cell-free plasma hemoglobin and
 xxxd2738xxx  scavenging in thrombosis, smooth muscle dystonia and
vasomotor abnormalities53. in this case, focus on a rare disease may
not only lead to benefit for afflicted individuals but may also contribute
to the overall foundation of knowledge. such knowledge may provide
insight into more common diseases with disordered  xxxd2738xxx  regulation, including systemic and pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, sickle
cell disease, and other genetic or acquired hemolytic anemias.
in summary, data from six clinical studies, enrolling a total of 195
participants, demonstrate the robust efficacy of eculizumab for the
treatment of individuals with pnh. every individual treated with eculizumab to date has shown an objective improvement in hemolysis.
treatment with eculizumab modifies the clinical course of pnh and
markedly reduces the serious morbidities associated with the disease. in
particular, therapy with eculizumab reduces anemia, blood transfusion
requirements, and the risk for life-threatening thrombosis. eculizumab
also improves other morbidities that are often serious, including fatigue,
pain, dyspnea and impaired overall quality of life. treated individuals
will continue to be monitored in a global registry. overall, the therapeutic benefit and safety of eculizumab in the treatment of patients with
the rare blood disease pnh validates the utility of terminal complement
inhibitor therapeutics for the treatment of medical conditions where
complement activation is involved.

erratum: funding crunch forces stem cell company to abandon therapies
monya baker
nat. biotechnol. 25, 951–952, 2007; published online 3 september 2007

© 2007 nature publishing group http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology

in the version of this article originally published, in the penultimate paragraph, the name of the monash university scientist was misspelled; the
correct spelling is colin pouton. in addition, the statement in paragraph 2 “the sscc, which is being supported by the same group that funded
esi, the agency for science, technology and research (a*star)” is incorrect. esi is not funded by a*star. its major investor is bio-one capital,
a venture capital fund controlled through the singapore government’s economic development board. the sscc is funded by a*star.

erratum: mice with a human touch
christopher thomas scott
nat. biotechnol. 25, 1075–1077, 2007; published online 6 october 2007
in the version of this article initially published, it was incorrectly stated on p. 1076, paragraph 2, line four from bottom, that “aya jakobovits,
originally at cell genesys and later at abgenix, shepherded the xenomouse through its entire development.” five of the six xenomouse strains
developed at abgenix were initiated after jakobovits left in 1997.

erratum: discovery and development of the complement inhibitor
eculizumab for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
russell p rother, scott a rollins, christopher f mojcik, robert a brodsky & leonard bell
nat. biotechnol. 25, 1256–1264 (2007); published online 7 november 2007; corrected after print 7 december 2007
in the version of this article initially published, on p. 1258, paragraph 2, the incorrect serum concentrations to reach steady state and the incorrect
accumulation ratio (racc) for eculizumab were given. the corrected sentence reads “eculizumab serum concentrations appear to reach steady state
after ~57 days. at steady state, the eculizumab accumulation ratio (racc) was calculated to be 1.075.” in addition, in figure 5, in the pdf version only,
the word “assessment” was cut off the bottom of the box beginning “september 2006.” the final sentence should read “bla and maa submitted
to fda and emea, respectively; receive accelerated assessment.” and in table 1, the heading “units of packed rbcs transfused/patient/month”
now appears in a separate row. the errors have been corrected in the html and pdf versions of the article.

corrigendum: a diverse family of thermostable cytochrome p450s created
by recombination of stabilizing fragments
yougen li, d allan drummond, andrew m sawayama, christopher d snow, jesse d bloom & frances h arnold
nat. biotechnol. 25, 1051–1056 (2007); published online 26 august 2007; corrected after print 7 december 2007
in the version of this article initially published, the sentence starting with “the most thermostable 450 p450 chimera” contains an extra “450.” the
correct sentence should start as follows “the most thermostable p450 chimera”. the error has been corrected in the html and pdf versions of
the article.
