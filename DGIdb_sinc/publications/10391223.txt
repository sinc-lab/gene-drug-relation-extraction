thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia syndrome ( xxxg2100xxx ;
mim 249270) is an autosomal recessive disorder with features
that include megaloblastic anaemia, mild thrombocytopenia
and leucopenia, sensorineural deafness and diabetes mellitus1–3. treatment with pharmacologic doses of thiamine ameliorates the megaloblastic anaemia and diabetes mellitus. a
defect in the plasma membrane transport of thiamine has been
demonstrated in erythrocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts
from  xxxg2100xxx  patients4–6. the gene causing  xxxg2100xxx  was assigned
to 1q23.2−q23.3 by linkage analysis7. here we report the
cloning of a new gene,  xxxg2100xxx , identified from high-throughput genomic sequences due to homology with slc19a1, encoding reduced folate carrier 1 (refs 8–10). we cloned the entire
coding region by screening a human fetal brain cdna library.
 xxxg2100xxx  encodes a protein (of 497 aa) predicted to have 12
transmembrane domains. we identified 2 frameshift mutations
in exon 2, a 1-bp insertion and a 2-bp deletion, among four
iranian families with  xxxg2100xxx . the sequence homology and predicted structure of  xxxg2100xxx , as well as its role in  xxxg2100xxx , suggest
that its gene product is a thiamine carrier, the first to be identified in complex eukaryotes.

recently, we refined the  xxxg2100xxx  locus at 1q23.2−q23.3 to 1.4 cm
(ref. 11). pac clone 206d15 was identified from the unigene
database as residing near the  xxxg2100xxx  critical region. the sanger
centre had sequenced this clone, and sequence analysis predicted
six exons for an unknown gene with homology to slc19a1.
despite minimal homology between the predicted partial protein
and the yeast thiamine transporter thi7 (refs 12,13), the fact that
thiamine and reduced folates were small organic molecules, as
well as the appropriate predicted function of this protein, suggested that it might be the  xxxg2100xxx  disease gene. pac 800f24 also
contained exon 6 of this putative gene.
to determine whether this putative gene mapped to the
 xxxg2100xxx  critical region, we developed a simple tandem repeat
marker (str). we identified 14 copies of a trinucleotide repeat
(ata) at nt 133,172−133,213 of pac clone 800f24, residing 34
kb from the putative gene. all affected individuals inherited this
polymorphic str homozygous by descent, including two individuals with critical recombinant chromosomes (fig. 1a). thus,
the str mapped to the  xxxg2100xxx  critical region between d1s3464
and d1s1619.
we sequenced est clones matching the 3´ half of exons 3−6.
screening of a human fetal brain cdna library identified three
clones containing the entire coding region of the transport
gene. the longest one comprised 3,648 bases with 5´ and 3´
utrs of 237 and 1,620 bp, respectively. the initiation atg
codon was followed by a guanine; the preceding bases, particularly the pyrimidine at position –3, did not conform to the
kozak consensus sequence, but have been encountered in other
vertebrate genes14,15. this atg was preceded by an in-frame
stop codon at position –222 without intervening atg codons;
the next available atg codon was at position 339, well into the
region of homology with slc19a1. polyadenylation sites were
identified in the 3´ utr at positions 2,387 and 3,395. the
encoded protein was predicted to have 12 transmembrane
fig. 1 haplotyping of iranian  xxxg2100xxx  kindreds. a, haplotypes of the affected
individuals with the critical recombinant chromosomes. from family a,
affected individual iv-1 inherited the ancestral haplotype from his mother (iii2), but a recombinant chromosome from his father. analysis with frl, the novel
trinucleotide repeat marker residing near  xxxg2100xxx , revealed homozygosity in iv1, suggesting that recombination occurred between frl and d1s3464. from
family b, affected individual v-3 inherited the ancestral  xxxg2100xxx  haplotype from
his mother (ii-2), but a recombinant chromosome from his father (iv-1). analysis of this family with frl documented that recombination occurred between
frl and d1s1619. these results were consistent with frl residing in the  xxxg2100xxx 
critical region. b, comparison of  xxxg2100xxx  haplotypes from iranian families. with
the addition of frl to the haplotype, families a and d continued to share an
identical haplotype over a 3.6-cm region as decribed11, whereas family b was
found to share the central 1.4-cm portion of that haplotype. the  xxxg2100xxx  haplotype observed in family c remained discordant with the others.

fig. 2 comparison of  xxxg2100xxx  and slc19a1 polypeptide sequences. the two
proteins were aligned using clustalw. identical residues are boxed in dark grey,
whereas similar ones are shown in light grey. horizontal brackets and roman

sequence, are not shown (indicated by the ellipsis).

domains (fig. 2) and 3 potential n-glycosylation sites (n63,
n314 and n414). it was highly homologous with the predicted
slc19a1 polypeptide (39% identity and 57% similarity), with
minimal homology at the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions
as well as the domain between transmembrane helices vi and
vii. tblastn searching of the caenorhabditis elegans genome
for  xxxg2100xxx /slc19a1 homologues identified three putative
genes (cf37b4.7, c50e3.11 and c06h2.4). sequence alignment with the worm proteins demonstrated that  xxxg2100xxx  was
most similar to cf37b4.7 (31% identity; 50% similarity),
whereas slc19a1 was homologous to c50e3.11 (24% identity,
43% similarity). no c. elegans protein was homologous to
 xxxg2100xxx  in the three domains where  xxxg2100xxx  and slc19a1
differed, making it unclear which, if any, was its orthologue.
thus,  xxxg2100xxx  and slc19a1 probably evolved from an ances-

fig. 3 northern analysis of  xxxg2100xxx  in human tissues. we established the
steady-state expression level in several adult human tissues (indicated above
lanes) by hybridizing with a radiolabelled est corresponding to the 3´ half of
 xxxg2100xxx . molecular weights based on co-electrophoresis of a size marker are
indicated (right). incubation of this blot with a human  xxxg53xxx  probe established
that approximately equal quantities of mrna were present in all lanes (b, brain;

i, small intestine; p, placenta; l, lung; w, peripheral leucocytes).

tral small organic molecule transporter, with subsequent development of substrate specificity.
to investigate the steady-state levels of  xxxg2100xxx  message, a
human multi-tissue northern blot was probed with a partial
cdna. an approximately 4-kb transcript was observed in all tissues in which  xxxg2100xxx  message was detected (fig. 3), suggesting
the existence of additional 5´ utr sequence.  xxxg2100xxx  message
was most abundant in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but lower levels were observed in kidney, liver, placenta and lung.
to search for  xxxg2100xxx  mutations, we sequenced the six exons
and their intron boundaries from four iranian  xxxg2100xxx  families11.
we identified two mutations, one shared by families a, b and d.
affected individual iv-1 from family a was homoallelic for insertion of an adenine after cdna nt 242 (242−243insa) in exon 2,
introducing a stop codon at codon 52 (fig. 4a). affected individual v-2 from family c was homoallelic for deletion of a tt dinucleotide at positions 429 and 430 (429−430deltt) in exon 2,
introducing a stop signal at codon 210 (fig. 4b). all affected individuals were homozygous for these mutations in families a, b
and d (242−243insa) as well as family c (429−430deltt) using
restriction endonuclease polymorphisms, whereas all parents
were heterozygous for these alleles (fig. 4c,d). the extent of the
haplotype shared by families a, b and d was only 1.4 cm
(fig. 1b), suggesting an ancient founding event.
the identification of two frameshift mutations in four  xxxg2100xxx 
families that disrupt a protein product with homology to another
solute carrier constitutes proof that  xxxg2100xxx  is the  xxxg2100xxx  disease gene. biochemical characterization of  xxxg2100xxx  cells suggests
that  xxxg2100xxx  protein is a high-affinity, saturable transporter of
thiamine4–6, the first identified in complex eukaryotes. on the
basis of the  xxxg2100xxx  phenotype, it is presumed that this carrier has
a role in the facilitated transport of thiamine into haematopoietic, pancreatic islet and auditory apparatus cells.
the  xxxg2100xxx  clinical manifestations do not occur at birth, and
often not in infancy, suggesting cumulative damage due to the
intracellular thiamine deficiency, perhaps due to ongoing apoptosis6. because low-affinity thiamine transport is still intact in
 xxxg2100xxx  cells4,5, this import mechanism presumably supplies adequate intracellular thiamine to prevent the early deleterious cellular derangement associated with severe thiamine deficiency.
this provides an explanation for the thiamine dependence of
some manifestations of the  xxxg2100xxx  phenotype; that is, increased
extracellular thiamine concentration results in partial correction
of the intracellular thiamine deficiency by increasing transport
via the low-affinity mechanism.
the role of  xxxg2100xxx  in thiamine metabolism explains many
features of  xxxg2100xxx  patients, but the  xxxg2100xxx  phenotype is not
identical to dietary thiamine deficiency16 (beriberi). in particu-

fig. 4 mutation analysis of  xxxg2100xxx  in  xxxg2100xxx . a, analysis of affected individual iv-1 from family a. an electropherogram showing sequence from a portion of
exon 2 (corresponding to  xxxg2100xxx  cdna nt 239−247) revealed insertion of an adenine between nt 242 and 243. b, analysis of affected individual v-2 from family
c. an electropherogram showing sequence of a portion of exon 2 (corresponding with  xxxg2100xxx  cdna nt 423−434) revealed deletion of a tt dinucleotide at nt
429 and 430. c, restriction analysis of the 239insa mutation. an 808-bp fragment was amplified by pcr from genomic dna and digested with msei. digestion of
wild-type sequence (lane 6) resulted in 743- and 65-bp fragments (the latter is not shown). the 239insa change introduced a novel msei site in the 743-bp fragment (resulting in 587- and 166-bp fragments), so analysis of two affected individuals from family d (lanes 3,4) showed only the smaller fragments. their parents
(lanes 1,2) and unaffected sibling (lane 5) had 743-, 587- and 166-bp fragments, consistent with heterozygosity for 239insa. d, restriction analysis of the 429−
430deltt mutation. a 379-bp fragment was amplified by mismatch pcr from genomic dna and digested with nlaiii. digestion of wild-type sequence (lane 11)
resulted in 258- and 121-bp fragments. the combination of the mismatch primer and the 429−430deltt change introduced an nlaiii site in the 121-bp fragment,
resulting in 96- and 25-bp fragments. analysis of 3 affected individuals from multiplex family c (lanes 4,9,10) revealed only 258- and 96-bp fragments, consistent
with homozygosity for the 429−430deltt mutation. two sets of parents (lanes 1,2,5,6) as well as one unaffected sibling (lane 7) showed 258-, 121- and 96-bp fragments, consistent with heterozygosity for the mutation. two additional siblings (lanes 3,8) appeared identical to wild type. the results with all siblings were consistent with their haplotypes (data not shown).

lar,  xxxg2100xxx  patients rarely have clinically apparent peripheral
neuropathy, cardiovascular collapse or severe central nervous
system involvement. although the low-affinity thiamine transport might ameliorate the metabolic derangement in those systems, it is difficult to imagine that the tissues most susceptible
to low serum thiamine concentrations in beriberi would
become impervious to a deficiency of facilitated transport of
thiamine. moreover, rogers observed that serum thiamine levels were normal in  xxxg2100xxx  patients1. as thiamine uptake from
the intestinal lumen also occurs by facilitated transport17, the
finding of normal serum thiamine in  xxxg2100xxx  predicts the existence of at least one additional solute carrier capable of thiamine transport in tissues not affected by  xxxg2100xxx  defects.
proof of this hypothesis may come from identification of a second thiamine carrier or from thiamine transport studies in an
animal model of  xxxg2100xxx .
methods
mapping and cloning of  xxxg2100xxx . we searched pac clones 206d15 and
800f24 sequences for strs using the tandem repeats finder18
(http://c3.biomath.mssm.edu/trf.upload.form.html). we used sense
and antisense oligonucleotides (5´−ccacacttgccaagagcaaag
ct−3´ and 5´−ggcatggtgaaatacactttagactca−3´, respectively) to amplify the str. to initiate cloning of full-length  xxxg2100xxx 
cdna, we assembled the predicted exon sequences and searched dbest
using the blastn algorithm. positive clones were obtained (genome
systems) and the inserts sequenced bidirectionally using an abi 377
fluorescent dna sequencer. we assembled sequences using the

autoassembler software package (applied biosystems). a fragment
from the first predicted exon to the 5´-most available est sequence was
amplified by pcr from a human heart library (marathon cdna amplification system, clontech) and sequenced. because the 5´ utr and 5´most codons were not apparent from genomic sequence analyses (nix
software package, uk-hgmp), we used 5´-race sequence from
human heart and fibroblast cdna libraries. subsequently, we searched
a heart fetal brain cdna library in pcdna2.1 by pcr (genome systems). the plasmid clones identified by this screen were sequenced
bidirectionally. the completed  xxxg2100xxx  cdna sequence was analysed
and compared with other relevant genes using the macvector software
package. we predicted putative transmembrane domains using the
doolittle hydropathy plot and hmmtop (ref. 19; http://www.enzim.
hu/hmmtop/).
 xxxg2100xxx  transcript size and tissue expression pattern. a northern blot
(clontech) with total rnas from several adult human tissues was incubated with a  xxxg2100xxx  cdna fragment from the 3´ half of the coding
region that had been radiolabelled with [32p]-dctp using the random
hexamer method. we used a storm 860 phosphorimager to visualize the
signal. to control for total mrna quantities on the blots, we incubated
a labelled human actin fragment with the same blot.
 xxxg2100xxx  mutation analysis. the  xxxg2100xxx  coding exons and their
intron boundaries were amplified by pcr from genomic dnas from
 xxxg2100xxx  patients. amplified fragments were sequenced and compared
with wild-type  xxxg2100xxx  sequences using the autoassembler software.
to confirm the identified changes, we developed pcr-based diagnostic
assays. for 239insa, an 808-bp fragment was amplified, digested with
