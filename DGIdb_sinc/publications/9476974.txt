response to cocaine. pharmacol biochem behav 59(2) 305–312, 1998.—intravenous (iv) cocaine (0.03–3 mg/kg)
produced dose-dependent, rapid, and brief increases in blood pressure (bp) in conscious rats pretreated with the dopamine
receptor antagonist, sch 23390. monoamine uptake inhibitors structurally analogous to cocaine (cocaethylene, cft, bcit,
cpt, (1)-cocaine, norcocaine, and benztropine) also produced this rapid pressor response, whereas structurally unrelated
uptake inhibitors with diverse  xxxg2099xxx  selectivities (btcp, indatraline, gbr 12935,  xxxd2546xxx ,  xxxd2746xxx ,
and  xxxd3555xxx ) either did not produce a rapid pressor response or produced only a small pressor response. at nonconvulsant
doses, the sodium channel blockers acetylprocainamide,  xxxd1869xxx ,  xxxd1956xxx , prilocaine, proparacaine, quinidine, and tetracaine produced a small pressor response or no increase in bp. in rats implanted with telemetric devices, cocaine and its analog, cft, produced a biphasic pharmacological response that consisted of an initial brief and abrupt behavioral arousal associated with a rapid, large increase in bp followed by prolonged, parallel increases in bp and locomotor activity. pretreatment
with sch 23390 prevented the prolonged but not the initial rapid and brief pressor and activity responses to both cocaine and
cft administration. the present data suggest that the inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin transporter functions, either alone or in combination, does not mediate the rapid pressor response to cocaine. the sodium channel-blocking
action of cocaine per se does not appear to be involved in the rapid pressor response to cocaine. finally, the present results
confirm previous findings that dopaminergic mechanisms mediate the prolonged increases in bp and locomotor activity produced by cocaine. © 1998 elsevier science inc.

but also for its cardiovascular effects. however, the precise
central, neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of cocaine and their interrelationship with the
mechanisms mediating the reinforcing and behavioral effects
of cocaine remains to be determined.

cocaine consistently increases blood pressure (bp) and
heart rate (hr) in humans (10,11,16,33) and in experimental
animals (4,13,27,38,50,51,55). a large body of experimental
evidence obtained from conscious animals suggests that the
central nervous system plays an important role in the pressor
and tachycardiac effects of cocaine (5,6,21,39,46,51–53,55).
thus, the actions of cocaine on the central nervous system are
important not only for its reinforcing and behavioral effects

to its ability to block sodium channel (20,25,29,32,40). a preponderance of experimental evidence indicates that reinforcing and other behavioral actions of cocaine are due primarily
to its ability to bind to dopamine transporters and thereby inhibit the uptake of dopamine. this leads to enhanced dopaminergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system, especially in the mesocorticolimbic system (9,17,19,23,34,35,57).
we recently suggested that two distinct pharmacodynamic
mechanisms may mediate different phases of the pharmacological response to cocaine (49). one is the dopamine-dependent action of cocaine described above, which mediates its
prolonged excitatory effects on locomotor activity, bp and
hr, while the other is a dopamine-independent action of cocaine and appears to mediate the initial rapid and brief effects, namely an abrupt and intense behavioral arousal that is
accompanied by large increases in bp and hr. because
blockers that are selective for norepinephrine (nisoxetine) or
serotonin (fluoxetine) transporters or for sodium channels
(lidocaine) did not mimic the latter-mentioned rapid and brief
effects of cocaine, it was inferred that neither selective inhibition of either norepinephrine or serotonin uptake nor blockade of sodium channels appears to mediate these rapid effects
of cocaine.
a major goal of the present study was to extend the previous findings and explore the possibility that some combination of  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitory mechanisms, rather
than any one alone, might underlie the initial rapid and brief
cardiovascular responses to iv cocaine. the effects on bp of
cocaine, various cocaine analogs, and several monoamine uptake inhibitors with diverse  xxxg2099xxx  selectivities were studied in conscious rats. because sodium channel
drugs differ in their rate kinetics of interaction (onset and recovery) with the channel (1,28,31), several sodium channel
blockers were tested to further verify the lack of involvement
of a sodium channel mechanism in the rapid pressor response
to cocaine. the ability of these compounds to produce the initial rapid and brief pressor response was assessed using a cumulative, dose–response design. the  xxxg655xxx 
antagonist, sch 23390, was administered prior to testing of
each compound to prevent the possible complicating influence of dopamine-dependent effects on bp (49). another
goal of this study was to further verify our original hypothesis
that the physiological response to cocaine is a biphasic phenomenon consisting of an initial dopamine-independent
abrupt behavioral arousal associated with large, rapid, and
brief increases in bp followed by dopamine-dependent prolonged increases in bp and locomotor activity. to achieve this
objective, an additional group of rats implanted with telemetric devices were tested with cft, an analog of cocaine, and
cocaine both in the presence and the absence of dopamine receptor blockade.
method

animals
male sprague–dawley rats (charles river laboratories,
wilmington, de) weighing 400–500 g were used. animals
were housed individually in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms with a 12 l:12 d (0700–1900 h; 1900–0700 h) cycle. throughout the study, rats were fed their daily food requirement of 5 g/100 g body weight of standard rat chow as a
single meal. this feeding schedule maintains a stable body
weight. our previous experience indicates that maintaining a
stable body weight results in extended catheter life as opposed to catheter life in animals with unlimited access to food.

therefore, this feeding schedule was used throughout the
study.
surgical and experimental procedures for recording bp
using a catheter technique
the procedures used are the same as those described in
our earlier publication (52). in brief, polyvinyl chloride catheters were inserted into the femoral artery and vein under halothane anesthesia for recording of bp and the infusion of
drugs, respectively. the free ends of the catheters were passed
subcutaneously and exited the skin at the midscapular region.
catheters were filled with heparinized saline (50 units of  xxxd2267xxx /ml of normal saline), closed with stainless steel
obturators and protected with rodent jackets (alice king
chatham medical arts, hawthorne, ca). rats were allowed
a postoperative recovery period of 7 days before experiments
began.
daily experimental sessions were conducted in home cages
monday through friday. the arterial catheter was connected
to a pressure transducer (model t42-20, coulbourn instruments, leigh valley, pa). the pressure signal from transducer was processed by an amplifier (model s72-25, coulbourn instruments) and recorded on a macintosh ii computer
using a maclab (world precision instruments, sarasota, fl)
interface and software. the peak changes in mean arterial
blood pressure (bp) within the first 30 s following administration of each dose of test drug was determined from the analog
recording. the bp values at all other times were determined
by averaging 5-s segments of the chart recording. cumulative
dose–response studies with several test drugs were done using
a 20-min interdose interval. all rats were pretreated with 0.1
mg/kg of r-(1)-sch 23390, a  xxxg655xxx  antagonist, 10 min prior to the start of the cumulative dose–response
testing. pretreatment with sch 23390 prevented the possible
complicating influence of a dopamine-dependent prolonged
bp response, which could be potentially produced by test
drugs similar to cocaine (49). in view of the short duration of
the effect of sch 23390, two or three supplemental doses
(0.05 mg/kg) were given at 45-min intervals during the dose–
response testing. drug testing was done twice a week with a
minimum of 2 days of drug-free sessions. during drug-free
sessions, animals did not receive sch 23390 or test drugs. on
any given test drug day, only one drug was studied. all doses
of test drugs were given as rapid bolus iv injections over a period of about 2 s. doses of monoamine uptake inhibitors were
chosen based on the doses noted in the literature as pharmacologically active (2,45). doses of sodium channel blockers
tested were carefully selected as to avoid convulsant effects by
testing the drugs in a separate group of control rats implanted
with venous catheters alone. the effect of an appropriate volume of the vehicle for each test drug was also studied by administering it 20 min following the last dose of each test drug.
for those drugs that produced rapid increases in bp, the effect of chlorisondamine (3 mg/kg) on the rapid pressor response was also evaluated. chlorisondamine was administered 1 h following the completion of vehicle testing. at this
time point, an additional dose of 0.1 mg/kg of sch 23390 was
also given. ten minutes following chlorisondamine and sch
23390 treatment, the effect of a single large dose of a given
test drug on bp was studied. the dose was chosen to equal the
maximum cumulative dose used in the dose–response study.
all animals were visually monitored for possible occurrence of
convulsions following administration of test drugs. all test drugs
as well as sch 23390 and chlorisondamine, were given iv.

rapid pressor response to cocaine
surgical and experimental procedures for recording of
cardiovascular and locomotor effects of cocaine and
its analog, cft, using telemetric devices
rats were surgically prepared with transmitters (ta11pac40, data sciences international, st. paul, mn) and iv catheters using multiple surgical procedures as described in our
previous publication (49). transmitters provided a means of
measuring both the cardiovascular and locomotor effects of
drugs simultaneously in the same animal. after 7 days of postoperative recovery and 3 weeks of acclimatization to the testing environment, drug testing was conducted twice a week
with a minimum of 2 days of drug-free sessions between test
sessions. the effects of 1 mg/kg doses of cft and cocaine were
studied by administering them 10 min after a 0.03 mg/kg dose
of sch 23390 on test drug days 1 and 2, respectively. similarly, the effects of 1 mg/kg dose of cft and cocaine were reexamined 10 min after saline administration on test drug days
3 and 4, respectively. all drugs were administered iv. cocaine and cft were each given as a rapid bolus injection over
a period of about 2 s. it has been reported that dopamine receptor antagonists are less effective in preventing the behavioral effects of cocaine challenge in animals that had previously received repeated daily injections of cocaine (48,54). in
view of this, evaluation of the effects of sch 23390 on cardiovascular and behavioral effects of cft and cocaine was done
first and then evaluation of the control responses (following
saline administration) to cft and cocaine were done in these
rats. although this introduced the possibility of order effects,
the initial rapid pressor response to cocaine in this testing paradigm did not appear to differ from the rapid pressor response produced by cocaine in animals that had no prior drug
history (49). the doses of sch 23390 (0.03–0.1 mg/kg) used in
the present study do not alter the cardiovascular responses to
the adrenergic agonists norepinephrine and  xxxd2401xxx 
(49). a 1 mg/kg dose of cft was chosen because this dose
produced a significant increase in bp in cumulative dose–
response studies.

307
dilutions were made in saline.  xxxd2546xxx  was prepared as a 10
mg/ml solution in 1 ml 1 n hcl and 9 ml saline, and further dilutions were made in saline. (1)-cocaine was prepared as a 30
mg/ml solution in 3 ml 1 n hcl and 7 ml saline and further dilutions were made in saline.
data analysis
the maximal changes in bp within the first 30 s following
injection of various doses of a given test drug were established
by comparison with the corresponding preinjection baseline
values. the change produced by a test drug was compared
with the corresponding change produced by its vehicle using
an analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by c
matrix post hoc tests (56). the postchlorisondamine effects of
the test drugs on bp were compared with their effects on bp
prior to chlorisondamine administration by using repeated measures, paired t-tests. all values are expressed as mean 6 se.
results

effects of cocaine and structurally related compounds
the iv administration of (2)-cocaine (0.03–3 mg/kg) following treatment with the dopamine receptor antagonist, sch
23390, produced dose-dependent and rapid increases in bp in
conscious rats (fig. 1). similar to cocaine, all test drugs that
are structurally related to cocaine also produced rapid pressor
responses (fig. 1). a maximal increase in bp occurred within
the first 30 s following the administration of these test drugs
and bp returned to baseline values within 3 min (data not
shown). the threshold doses of the test drugs that produced a
significant increase in bp (p , 0.05 to 0.001 compared to vehicle effects) were 0.03 mg/kg (2)-cocaine, 0.3 mg/kg (1)-cocaine, 0.1 mg/kg norcocaine, 0.03 mg/kg cocaethylene, 0.3 mg/

prior to the administration of several doses of each test drug
on any given test day. none of these test drugs produced convulsions in the dose range tested. chlorisondamine (3 mg/kg)

mg/kg), or proparacaine (0.01–0.3 mg/kg) did not significantly
alter bp. the effects of higher doses of these four drugs were
not tested since on pilot testing they produced convulsions. in
a dose range of 0.03–0.3 mg/kg, the test drugs  xxxd1956xxx ,
 xxxd1869xxx , and tetracaine also did not increase bp, but 1 mg/
kg dose, produced small but significant increases in bp (p ,
0.01). a 3 mg/kg dose of these three drugs was not tested because pilot testing had convulsant effects. there were no significant differences in baseline bp prior to the administration
of different doses of each test drug on any given test day (data
not shown).

with the exception of bupropion, the iv administration of
several test drugs that are structurally unrelated to cocaine,
following treatment with sch 23390, produced a small
( xxxd2546xxx ) or no increases in bp in conscious rats (fig. 2).
some of these test compounds, namely gbr 12935 (p ,
0.001) and indatraline (p , 0.05) at 3 mg/kg doses, produced
rapid (10 s), transient (,30 s), and small but significant reductions in bp. although  xxxd2546xxx  did produce a pressor response, the mean increase was small (,20 mmhg) and only
occurred at the highest dose (3 mg/kg) tested. bupropion
(0.1–3 mg/kg), like (2)-cocaine, produced large, rapid, and
dose-dependent increases in bp. the minimal dose of bupropion that produced a significant increase in bp was 0.3 mg/kg.
chlorisondamine (3 mg/kg) antagonized the rapid pressor response to bupropion (table 1). the serotonin-selective uptake inhibitor,  xxxd3555xxx , did not increase bp and, instead, at
a high dose (10 mg/kg) significantly (p , 0.01) reduced bp
(fig. 2). this reduction in bp was brief, lasting less than 1 min.
there were no significant differences in baseline bp prior to
the administration of different doses of each test drug on any
given test day (data not shown). none of these test drugs produced convulsions in the dose ranges tested.
effects of sodium channel blockers

channel blockers, following treatment with sch 23390, produced small or no increases in bp in conscious rats (fig. 3).

rapid pressor response to cocaine

telemetric recording of bp and locomotor activity
following iv cocaine and cft

amine uptake inhibition or sodium channel blockade. in the
present study the maximal increase in bp that occurred within
30 s following iv injection of test drugs in the presence of
dopamine receptor blockade was used as a quantitative measure of these rapid effects. a number of test drugs with a wide
range of selectivities for monoamine transporters and a number of sodium channel blockers were evaluated for their ability to produce the rapid pressor response. as reported in our
previous study (49), cocaine produced an initial, rapid, and
brief increase in bp in the presence of dopamine receptor
blockade in the present study.
one important finding of the present study is that inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin transporter

both cocaine and cft at a dose of 1 mg/kg produced rapid
and brief increases in bp with peak effects occurring 15 s after
drug injection. the increase in bp produced by cocaine was
significantly ( p , 0.01) larger than that of cft (fig. 4). cocaine produced a rapid onset (within 6–8 s), brief (,30 s), and
intense behavioral arousal immediately prior to and during
this rapid pressor response. this arousal consisted of animals
rising abruptly on all four limbs from a resting posture, followed by rapid running to the other end of the cage and intense facial and head scratching. following cft, animals got
up on all four limbs from a resting posture. unlike cocaine,
cft produced neither rapid running nor facial and head
scratching. following initial increases in bp, it rapidly, but
only partially, returned towards baseline. thereafter, bp remained moderatively elevated for a relatively prolonged period following both cocaine and cft. both cocaine and cft
also produced prolonged increases in locomotor activity. intervention with sch 23390 (0.03 mg/kg), antagonized the prolonged increases in locomotor activity and bp, but not the initial rapid pressor, and abrupt arousal responses produced by
both cocaine and cft (fig. 4).
discussion

endogenous dopaminergic systems play an important role
in the behavioral and reinforcing effects of cocaine (2,3,8,
14,15,17,42,43,45,57). in a recent study using monoamineselective uptake inhibitors (gbr-12909, nisoxetine, and fluoxetine), we reported that the central dopaminergic systems
also play a major role in mediating cocaine-induced prolonged increases in bp and hr. these prolonged increases in
bp and hr produced by cocaine temporally paralleled its
prolonged locomotor effects (49). we further suggested that
the initial brief and abrupt behavioral arousal and the accompanying brief but large increases in bp and hr that rapidly
occur following iv bolus cocaine may be independent of mono-

function either alone or in combination does not appear to
mediate the initial, rapid, and brief pressor response to cocaine. this interpretation is based on the following observations. first, dopamine- and serotonin-selective uptake inhibitors, namely gbr-12935 and  xxxd3555xxx , did not cause a rapid
pressor response. these results are consistent with our previous data (49) obtained with different dopamine- and serotonin-selective uptake inhibitors, namely gbr 12909 and fluoxetine, respectively. similarly, the norepinephrine-selective
uptake inhibitors, desipramine and nisoxetine, did not produce a rapid pressor response (49,52). second, the binding affinities of cocaine analogs, namely, cpt, cft, and bcit to
monoamine transporters are higher than that of cocaine,
while these drugs were considerably less potent than cocaine
in eliciting rapid pressor responses (fig. 1). third, the affinities of (1) cocaine to monoamine transporters is about 150- to
500-fold less than that of (2) cocaine (34) and has been shown
to be inactive in behavioral testing paradigms (44). in contrast, (1) cocaine, like (2) cocaine, clearly produced a dosedependent rapid pressor response. fourth,  xxxd2746xxx  and
 xxxd2546xxx  inhibit both dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, but they did not produce a rapid pressor effects.
bcit, an analog of cocaine, binds to both dopamine and serotonin transporters with very high affinity, but it was considerably less potent than cocaine. finally, indatraline, which is
similar to cocaine in inhibiting nonselectively all three  xxxg2099xxx  systems, did not produce a rapid pressor response in the present study. the fact that cpt, bcit, and
cft, the long-acting analogs with slow kinetics (7,36,37), produce rapid pressor responses suggests that these initial effects
to cocaine are not due to its rapid pharmacokinetics. further,
the fact that cocaine, when administered as a slow iv infusion,
also produces these rapid pressor responses (49).
another finding of the present study is that the sodium
channel blocking action of cocaine per se is also not involved
in triggering the rapid pressor response. this interpretation is
based on the following. several sodium channel blockers, at
doses that do not evoke clinical seizures, produced either
small or no increases in bp. both rapid (lidocaine) as well as
slow (quinidine) acting sodium channel blockers lacked the
rapid pressor response. the sodium channel blockers that
produced small, but significant, increases in bp did so at doses
only two to three times less than the convulsant threshold
doses. in contrast to these drugs, the threshold dose of cocaine that produces a significant rapid pressor response in
conscious sprague–dawley rats was about 0.03 mg/kg, while a
100-fold (3 mg/kg) increase in the dose of cocaine did not produce convulsions. it is, therefore, likely that the small increases in bp produced by high doses of several sodium channel blockers is due to their nonclinical proconvulsant effects
on the brain. further, lidocaine, at doses up to 100 times
greater than the threshold dose of cocaine, does not elicit a
rapid pressor response (49), although it is equipotent to cocaine as a sodium channel blocker (12). moreover, cocaethylene and norcocaine are more potent than cocaine in blocking
sodium channels (18,26,58), yet these compounds were either
less (cocaethylene) or equipotent (norcocaine) to cocaine in
producing rapid pressor responses in the present study. there
is one recent study in conscious rabbits, suggesting that the
pressor response to cocaine is partly due to its sodium channel
blocking property (47). but the pressor response to cocaine
was observed at a 5 mg/kg dose, which also produced convulsions. in this study cocaine at nonconvulsant doses (0.2 and
1 mg/kg) did not increase bp, but instead decreased bp. it is
important to note that the bp effects of cocaine in conscious

tella and goldberg
rabbits appear to be qualitatively different from the reported
consistent pressor responses to nonconvulsant doses of cocaine in conscious rats (21,22,51,52), dogs (46,55), squirrel monkeys (13,38,39,50), rhesus monkeys (4) and humans (10,11,16,33).
in the present study, test drugs with chemical structures
similar to cocaine also produced a rapid pressor response,
while several monoamine uptake inhibitors not structurally
related to cocaine, with the exception of bupropion, did not
produce a rapid pressor response. this suggests that cocaine
and its structural analogs may share a common pharmacodynamic action mediating the rapid pressor response. the fact
that bupropion, which is not structurally similar to cocaine,
also elicited a rapid and brief pressor response suggests that
this drug may be similar to cocaine in this regard. alternatively, bupropion may be producing a rapid pressor response
through a mechanism different from that of cocaine and its
analogs. the rapid pressor responses produced by cocaine analogs and bupropion were antagonized by chlorisondamine
administration. this is in agreement with several previous reports that ganglionic blockers can antagonize the pressor response to cocaine in a number of species. (5,21,22,46,51–53,55).
the mechanism underlying the rapid pressor response to cocaine remains unclear. one possible mechanism that needs to
be studied is an unknown complex interplay between  xxxg2099xxx  and sodium channel mechanisms. alternatively, this action may be due to an undefined novel pharmacodynamic action of cocaine.
the data obtained from rats implanted with telemetric devices indicate that cocaine produces biphasic effects on bp
and behavior. these consist of an initial, abrupt, and brief
arousal associated with a rapid, large increase in bp followed
by prolonged and parallel increases in bp and locomotor activity. these biphasic effects of cocaine are similar to those reported in our previous report with regard to their time course
and the susceptibility of the prolonged, but not the initial effects, to blockade by a dopamine receptor antagonist (49).
this hypothesis of biphasic effects of cocaine is further extended to cft, a cocaine analog. similar to cocaine, cft produced biphasic effects on bp and behavior and the dopamine
receptor antagonist, sch 23390, clearly prevented the prolonged increases in bp and locomotion produced by cft.
it is important to note certain methodological limitations
of the present study. first, a cumulative dose–response study
was performed by administering doses of each test drug at 20min intervals. it is not clear as to the extent of possible contribution of within-session acute tolerance to pressor responses
of the test drugs. tolerance to the pressor effects of repeated
iv doses of 1 mg/kg cocaine has been reported in rats, when
cocaine is given at 5 min, but not at 2-h interdose intervals
(41). cocaine in doses less than 0.8 mg/kg iv, when administered repeatedly at 1-h intervals, does not appear to produce
tolerance in conscious dogs (30). kumor et al. (24) have reported that tolerance to cocaine’s pressor actions does not develop in humans. it is likely that the occurrence of tolerance
may be dependent on the dose of cocaine studied and the interdose interval, with small doses and high interdose intervals
not likely producing tolerance. it is not clear whether the 20min interdose interval in the present study was adequate to
avert the manifestation of acute tolerance. further, it is also
not known whether tolerance could occur with the cocaine analogs used in the present study.
in summary, the present study suggests that inhibition of
dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin transporter function
neither alone nor in combination mediates the rapid pressor
effects of cocaine. the sodium channel blocking action of co-

caine per se also does not mediate its rapid pressor effects.
prolonged increases in bp occurring after iv cocaine administration, unlike the rapid increases, are mediated by dopaminergic mechanisms.
