abstract
the a1a- and a1b-adrenoceptor affinity of the typical (chlorpromazine, haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx , thioridazine and  xxxd3431xxx ) and atypical
(clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx ) antipsychotics was determined by competition binding at a1a- and a1badrenoceptors in rat submaxillary gland and liver. although all antipsychotics bound to both subtypes with relatively high affinity (k isb74 nm),
none were selective (n10-fold). comparison with published  xxxg656xxx  affinities suggests that antipsychotic blockade of a1a- and/or
a1b-adrenoceptors may contribute to the antipsychotic activity of all the atypical and several of the typical antipsychotics examined.

1. introduction
in addition to their  xxxg656xxx  antagonism,
most clinically effective antipsychotics are also potent a1adrenoceptor (a1-ar) antagonists, and this activity has been
suggested to contribute to antipsychotic effect (baldessarini
et al., 1992). previously, we have shown the prototypical
atypical clozapine and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol
differentially regulate central a1-ar binding following
chronic treatment in the rat. while both antipsychotics
significantly increased a1-ar binding in the thalamus,
clozapine alone up-regulated a1-ars in the frontal cortex,
indicating a1-ar blockade may contribute to its superior
atypical clinical effects (cahir et al., 2004). functional and
radioligand binding investigations have identified two
central a1-ar subtype proteins, a1a and a1b. these are
coexpressed in different ratios in the frontal cortex and
thalamus (wilson and minneman, 1989; trejo et al., 1996),
but the relative importance of each subtype in contributing
to antipsychotic induced a1-ar regulation has not been
examined. therefore, to determine if regional differences in
a1-ar regulation following chronic clozapine or haloper* corresponding author. tel.: +44 028 90975791; fax: +44 028

idol treatment reflect differences in a1a/b-ar selectivity, we
determined the a1a- and a1b-ar affinity of both. in
addition, eight additional typical and atypical antipsychotics
were assessed for comparison. rat submaxillary gland and
liver tissue models were used as these express homogeneous
a1a - and a1b-ar populations, respectively, and are
pharmacologically indistinguishable from central binding
sites (michel et al., 1989). nonselective and selective a1aand a1b-ar antagonists were included for reference.

2. experimental procedures
2.1. chemicals
[3h]  xxxd3000xxx  (80 ci/mmol) was purchased from perkinelmer life sciences, (cambridge, uk). the following
antipsychotics were donated by the manufacturers: clozapine (novartis, basel, switzerland), olanzapine (eli lilly &
co., in, usa), quetiapine (astrazeneca, cheshire, uk) and
 xxxd3195xxx  (lundbeck, copenhagen, denmark). ziprasidone
was not available for us to test. remaining antipsychotics,
standard chemicals and reference compounds were purchased from sigma-aldrich (dorset, uk). competitors were
dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  to 10 mm and diluted
further with 20%  xxxd1896xxx  prior to assay.

2.2. tissue preparation
submaxillary glands and liver, employed as a1a- and
a1b-ar models, respectively were obtained from male
sprague–dawley rats (250–300 g) immediately after sacrifice, and membranes were prepared from each tissue as
described (o’malley et al., 1998). all procedures were in
accordance with european community guidelines for the
use of experimental animals.
2.3. [3h]  xxxd3000xxx  binding assay
radioligand binding was performed as described with
minor modifications (o’malley et al., 1998). briefly,
membrane homogenates, [3h]  xxxd3000xxx  (60–90 pm) and
12 competitor concentrations between 10 13 to 10 4 m, as
appropriate, were incubated in a 500 al final volume of
incubation buffer (50 mm tris–hcl, 5 mm edta, 150 mm
nacl, ph 7.4) for 120 min at 20 8c. membrane protein
concentrations were determined with a bio-rad assay kit
using a bovine  xxxg124xxx  standard; final protein
concentrations were 24 and 90 ag protein/well for submaxillary gland and liver, respectively. nonspecific binding was
defined by 10 am 5-methyl urapidil. incubations were
terminated by rapid filtration over 0.5% polyethyleneimine
pretreated filters (whatman gf/c) followed by washing
with incubation buffer and scintillation counting.
2.4. data analysis
ic50 values were calculated using one-site nonlinear
regression analysis (graphpad prism, san diego, ca). k d
values for  xxxd3000xxx  were determined by homologous
competition, k i values for reference competitors, and
antipsychotics were calculated from ic50 values using the
cheng-prusoff equation.

meanfs.e.m. k i values (nm) of (n) experiments. assays were performed
with 60–90 pm [3h]  xxxd3000xxx .

 xxxd3000xxx  was nonsubtype selective as similar k d values at
the a1a- and a1b-ars were determined by homologous
competition. the a1a-ar selective reference compounds 5methyl urapidil and wb4101 exhibited approximately 100fold and 10-fold a1a selectivity, respectively. spiperone was
moderately (approximately 7-fold) a1b selective.
3.2. antipsychotics
the a1a- and a1b-ar affinity and selectivity ratios of
antipsychotics are shown in table 2. all antipsychotics
bound to both a1-ar subtypes with relatively high affinity
although within a wide affinity range for each subtype.
there was an approximate 150- and 280-fold difference
between the highest ( xxxd3195xxx ) and lowest (olanzapine)
affinities for the a1a- and a1b-ar subtypes, respectively.
however, none of the antipsychotics examined was able to
discriminate significantly between the two subtypes
(defined as n10-fold separation in subtype affinities).
chlorpromazine exhibited the greatest selectivity, binding
to the a1a with 4-fold higher affinity than to the a1b site.
 xxxd3195xxx  and thioridazine were very weakly a1a selective
(2-fold). conversely,  xxxd2956xxx , haloperidol, clozapine and
quietapine exhibited weak a1b-ar selectivity (2-fold). the
remaining antipsychotics possessed equivalent subtype
affinity.

4. discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first study to directly
examine the a1a- and a1b-ar subtype affinities of a wide
range of clinically available typical and atypical antipsychotics, using separate subtype models in a single and
therefore comparative study. ten antipsychotic drugs,
including clozapine and haloperidol, and four reference
compounds were evaluated, and their a1a/b selectivity was

m. cahir, d.j. king / european neuropsychopharmacology 15 (2005) 231–234

determined in the rat. the reference compounds used
exhibited appropriate affinities and selectivity (hancock,
1996), but none of the antipsychotics were significantly
subtype selective (n10-fold).
general a1-ar affinity has been reported for all
antipsychotics investigated, and these values and relative
affinities are in general agreement with the present results
(richelson and nelson, 1984; peroutka and snyder, 1980;
schotte et al., 1996). richelson and nelson (1984) report a
monophasic competitive displacement of [3h]  xxxd3000xxx  in
human frontal cortex by chlorpromazine, haloperidol,
thioridazine,  xxxd3431xxx  and clozapine, suggesting that
these agents are not highly a1a/b selective. however, these
data are difficult to interpret as suitable reference compounds needed to demonstrate the presence of both central
a1-ar subtypes in this preparation were not included.
the inability of risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx  to discriminate
between a1a- and a1b-ars in the present investigation is in
contrast with the findings from several earlier studies. in
functional isolated tissue experiments with rat vas deferens
(a1a) and guinea pig/mouse spleen (a1b), risperidone
exhibited weak (10-fold) a1a-ar selectivity (eltze, 1996).
discrepancies between functional and the present radioligand binding results may reflect pharmacological differences between techniques in terms of buffers and incubation
conditions employed or species differences. however, in
competition binding in the rat hippocampus, risperidone is
also reported to be 120-fold a1b-ar selective (sleight et al.,
1993). the deduced a1a-ar affinity is inconsistent with the
reported general a1-ar affinity of risperidone, and several
competition binding studies in rat cortical membranes which
should be able to detect a1a/b-ar affinity differences of this
magnitude have not confirmed this (leysen et al., 1998;
bymaster et al., 1996).
the published selectivity data for  xxxd3195xxx  are also
contradictory. in separate studies using cloned bovine a1aand hamster a1b-ars, it is documented both to be 70-fold
a1a selective (ipsen et al., 1997) and to be nonselective (balle
et al., 2003), in agreement with the present observations.
however, the use of [125i]-heat by ipsen et al., which unlike
[3h]  xxxd3000xxx  is slightly a1a subtype selective (hancock,
1996), may account for this discrepancy.
all clinically effective antipsychotics are dopamine d2
receptor antagonists which underlies their ability to alleviate
positive symptoms in schizophrenia. by comparing the
present a1a/b-ar affinity values with reported d2 affinities
(leysen et al., 1998; richelson and nelson, 1984), the
antipsychotics examined can be divided into three categories, those with higher a1a/b than d2 affinity (quetiapine,
 xxxd3195xxx , clozapine, thioridizine and chlorpromazine),
those with equivalent affinity (risperidone, olanzapine and
 xxxd2956xxx ) and those which are predominantly d2 antagonists (haloperidol and  xxxd3431xxx ). this would suggest
that all atypicals and three of the typical antipsychotics
examined would significantly interact with both a1a and bars at therapeutically relevant doses.

this ranking also reflects some of the important
behavioural effects of these drugs. deficits in sensorimotor
gating observed in schizophrenia can be modelled in rats by
the nmda antagonist, phencyclidine (pcp). intriguingly,
pcp-induced deficits in prepulse inhibition are resistant to
dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonists but can be
antagonised by  xxxd3000xxx  (a selective a1-ar antagonist)
and the atypicals quetiapine, clozapine and olanzapine
(bakshi and geyer, 1997) in a rank order of potency that
reflects their relative a1-ar/d2 affinity. although only
atypicals are generally effective in this model, chlorpromazine may be the exception to the rule as, like clozapine, it
opposed ketamine-induced ppi deficits, whereas haloperidol
was ineffective (swerdlow et al., 1998). this is in
accordance with its aforementioned classification with
several atypical antipsychotics. thioridazine would be
expected to behave similarly but to date has not been
examined in this model.
the present results suggest that the previous finding of
regional differences in a1-ar up-regulation following
chronic clozapine or haloperidol administration (cahir et
al., 2004) are not due to differences in their a1a/b-ar
selectivities but may reflect differential a1-ar occupancy.
furthermore, clozapine’s blockade of a1a- and/or a1b-ars in
the frontal cortex, combined with other receptor interactions,
may contribute to its clinically superior atypical antipsychotic
effects. in the thalamus, both subtypes may be important for
the production of general antipsychotic effects or for a1-ar
centrally mediated side effects such as sedation.
we have not determined antipsychotic affinity at the a1dar. this subtype has only been identified at the mrna
level in human and rodent brain despite numerous efforts to
detect it by radioligand binding (yang et al., 1997). this
suggests it is either not expressed or is present at a very low
level and is therefore not likely to make a major contribution
to the increase in a1-ar binding following antipsychotic
treatment. one limitation of the present investigation is that
the affinities have been obtained with peripheral tissues,
which may vary slightly from those in brain. therefore,
before extrapolating these results to patient studies, it will be
important to determine affinity at cloned human receptors.
in summary, all the antipsychotics investigated exhibited
moderate to high a1a/b-adrenoceptor affinity, although none
could discriminate between these subtypes. however, when
compared to their reported  xxxg656xxx  affinities,
these data suggest that interactions with a1a- and/or a1bars may be important for the actions of all atypical and
selected typical drugs.
