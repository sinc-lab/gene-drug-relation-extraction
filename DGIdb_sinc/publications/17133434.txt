abstract
this study examines the evolution of size
differences among papionin primates by measuring hormones that regulate size growth during ontogeny and
inﬂuence ultimate adult size (insulin-like growth factor-i
( xxxg1144xxx ), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3
(igfbp-3),  xxxg890xxx  (ghbp), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( xxxg2231xxx ), testosterone, estradiol). the analyses assess longstanding ideas about circulating hormone levels and body size. importantly, because
the consensus papionin molecular phylogeny implies at
least two episodes of size increase, this study offers opportunities to determine whether or not similar hormone proﬁles regulate this apparent evolutionary convergence (i.e.,
do larger-bodied papionins have higher levels of growthrelated hormones than smaller-bodied papionins?). five
hundred and sixty serum samples (from 161 individuals)
from 11 papionin species were analyzed using a two-level

approach to address this issue. one used mixed longitudinal samples from two papionin species to test whether, during growth, large- and small-bodied species have higher
and lower hormone levels, respectively. the second compared multiple papionin species to assess whether or not
hormone levels covary with size in adult animals. result
show that size and hormone levels do not covary consistently across papionins, either during growth or in adulthood. speciﬁcally, some smaller-bodied papionin species
have higher absolute hormone levels than larger-bodied
species. differences in some hormone levels appear to track
phylogeny more closely than body size. in contrast to studies based on single species, we demonstrate that, while the
hormones analyzed affect growth, absolute circulating hormone levels either during growth or adulthood may be
decoupled from interspeciﬁc differences in body size. am

body size ﬁgures prominently in comparative analyses
of life histories (calder, 1984; harvey and clutton-brock,
1985), intraspeciﬁc size dimorphism (leutenegger and
larson, 1985; plavcan, 2001), and allometry (jungers,
1985), and is also an important component of theories of
sexual and natural selection (mcmahon and bonner,
1983; schmidt-nielsen, 1984; ford, 1994; plavcan and
van schaik, 1997; smith and jungers, 1997; lindenfors
and tullberg, 1998). the wide range of variation in body
size in primate taxa provides opportunities to investigate
the developmental mechanisms associated with the evolutionary changes in body mass that are common in primate taxa (godfrey et al., 1990; ford and davis, 1992; cf.
delson et al., 2000). such size transformations can be produced through different developmental processes (leigh,
1992; leigh and shea, 1996), including alterations of the
rate or timing of somatic growth (shea, 1983). consequently, comparative study of the physiological factors
that play a role in differences in the timing or rate of somatic growth, such as hormones, provides key information regarding the evolution of size change among species
(shea, 1992). however, almost every study of the endocrine regulation of development and adult size is limited
to intraspeciﬁc comparisons, particularly in primates,
and often use mutant, experimental, or pathologic lineages of nonprimate mammals (e.g., copeland et al., 1982,
1984; kraemer et al., 1982; mann et al., 1983; castracane
et al., 1986; wilson, 1986, 1997, 1998a,b; shea et al.,
1987, 1990; schwartz et al., 1988; styne, 1991; crawford
et al., 1997; setchell and dixson, 2001a,b; see cutler
et al., 1978; smail et al., 1982; pryce et al., 1995;
coe et al., 1992 for studies which employ a multispecies
analysis of differences in primate steroid levels). this

raises critical questions about whether or not the ﬁndings
of these studies hold for an interpretation of size differences at higher taxonomic (i.e. interspeciﬁc) levels.
the present study addresses the question of how size
evolves by conducting two kinds of interspeciﬁc comparative analyses to investigate papionin body size variation.
we analyze variation in papionin primates in order to distinguish between two alternative hypotheses about the
relationship of hormone levels to size. a traditional hypothesis suggests that larger-bodied species have absolutely higher hormone levels (especially  xxxg1144xxx , igfbp-3,
and ghbp) than smaller-bodied species. an alternative
hypothesis, based on evidence from recent experimental
research, suggests that circulating hormone levels are
not necessarily related to size (butler and le roith,
2001). first, we investigate whether or not species size
difference (not individual size differences) during ontogeny are correlated with hormone levels in two differently
sized species (sooty mangabeys (cercocebus atys) and

olive baboons (papio hamadryas anubis)). second, we examine whether or not adult papionin body size differences
is positively related to hormone levels. testing the proposed hypotheses at both ontogenetic and adult levels enables us to compare how hormones relate to growth (i.e. size
change within a species) with how hormones relate to the
evolution of size differences. following the extensive literature documenting the hormonal correlates of intraspeciﬁc
size differences (reviewed below), we anticipate that larger
bodied papionins (papio, mandrillus, theropithecus) will
show higher levels of growth related hormones both during
development and as adults than smaller bodied papionins
(cercocebus, lophocebus, macaca). it is important to note
that the power of our tests of alternative hypotheses varies
considerably. speciﬁcally, we can provide a relatively
strong test of the traditional hypothesis, by measuring patterns of covariation between size and circulating hormone
levels, and by considering interactions among growth and
steroid hormones. on the other hand, we are unable to
conclusively test hypotheses about hormones at the tissue
level in the absence of information about speciﬁc tissues.
but perhaps more importantly, out analysis is extremely
well suited to revealing potential limitations of single species hormone studies.

fig. 1. the somatotropic axis. ghrh ( xxxd3223xxx 
releasing hormone) secreted by the hypothalamus causes release
of gh ( xxxd3223xxx ) from the pituitary, which acts in various
target tissues to stimulate production and release of  xxxg1144xxx  and
 xxxg1146xxx  which circulate bound to various binding proteins (bp),
levels of which then act in a feedback manner to regulate further
secretion of ghrh through secretion of somatostatin, or somatotropin release-inhibiting hormone (srih). gh also has direct
effects on target tissue via binding with its receptor (ghr).

background
the somatotropic axis and models of the
hormonal regulation of growth
models of the hormonal regulation of growth, centered
on the somatotropic axis (fig. 1), have changed with continued experimental investigation. the somatotropic axis
consists of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and liver
and target tissue, with the endocrine products  xxxg891xxx , somatostatin,  xxxd3223xxx ,
insulin-like growth factors, respective receptors, and binding proteins.  xxxd3223xxx  (gh) is an important mediator of body growth, although the diurnal ﬂuctuations in its
pattern of secretion make it an untenable hormone for the
present analyses since samples were collected too infrequently to establish baseline values (hadley, 2000). several
studies have documented relationships between levels of
other components of the somatotropic axis and size, especially insulin-like growth factor-i ( xxxg1144xxx ) and  xxxg890xxx  (ghbp). all of these studies are
intraspeciﬁc in nature, and describe the relationship between these hormones and size during growth and adulthood, in humans and non-humans alike (eigenmann et al.,
1984; binoux and gourmelen, 1987; merimee et al., 1987;
eigenmann et al., 1988; merimee, 1989; clavano-harding
et al., 1999; hesse et al., 1994; lindgren et al., 1996;
beckett et al., 1998). insulin-like growth factor binding
protein-3 also plays a role in growth and size, by forming a
complex with  xxxg1144xxx  in circulation, thereby prolonging its
half-life of serum  xxxg1144xxx  (hintz, 1990), and facilitating delivery of  xxxg1144xxx  to cellular receptors (kelley et al., 1996).
a chain of models with the above components has been
constructed, from the original ‘somatomedin hypothesis’
(daughaday et al., 1972) to the ‘revised somatomedin hypothesis’ (isaksson et al., 1982), to most recently, the ‘somatomedin hypothesis 2000’ (fig. 2) (butler and le roith,
2001). this most recent model holds that gh-stimulated
local  xxxg1144xxx , acting in a paracrine or autocrine manner
instead of circulating  xxxg1144xxx , is largely responsible for somatic growth (butler and leroith, 2001). it is based on
experiments using transgenic and temporally speciﬁc
knockout techniques, which have shown that endocrine

fig. 2. the ‘somatomedin hypothesis 2000.’ in this scheme,
most of the circulating (endocrine)  xxxg1144xxx , produced by the liver,
is not involved in postnatal growth. instead, locally acting paracrine and autocrine  xxxg1144xxx  drives growth.

 xxxg1144xxx  is not necessary for normal somatic growth in mice
(sjögren et al., 1999). however, experimental ﬁndings
such as those that demonstrate signiﬁcant growth
responses following subcutaneous  xxxg1144xxx  therapy in individuals with either  xxxg1144xxx  gene deletion or  xxxd3223xxx 
receptor dysfunction suggest that endocrine  xxxg1144xxx  still
plays an important role in human growth (guevaraaguirre et al., 1997; camacho-hübner et al., 2002). therefore, the relative importance of systemic versus local

actions of  xxxg1144xxx  remains unclear (d’ercole and calikoglu,
2001). despite the power of experimental models, they do
not and cannot replicate the naturally occurring variation
across species in these systems, inevitably limiting applications to evolutionary explanations for differences in size. in
particular, a single-species framework is inappropriate for
addressing issues on a larger scale, such as the evolutionary basis for differences in size between large and small
species. indeed, part of the continuing debate about these
models may stem from the lack of comparative studies.
additional problems in testing these models arise
because they generally ignore other important hormonal
contributions to growth and development, including those
of steroids (veldhuis et al., 1997). this may be especially
important for dimorphic species, such as many papionin
primates. in any case, the main way in which sex steroids
affect growth is through their impact on the somatotropic
axis. studies on model species have shown that linear skeletal growth, body weight, and organ size are dependent on
either a pulsatile or continuous (\male" or \female") mode
of gh release (veldhuis, 1996). these different temporal
patterns of gh delivery to target tissues can apparently
inﬂuence gene expression and protein production
(veldhuis et al., 2001). the aromatization of testosterone,
or its conversion to estradiol, is a mandatory step in the
androgenic stimulation of the somatotropic axis (pazos
et al., 2000). finally, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
( xxxg2231xxx ) is another steroid that may be important for
understanding interspeciﬁc differences in growth and size.
a relatively weak androgen, it can function as a major precursor of testosterone and estradiol in peripheral tissues
(rainey et al., 2002).  xxxg2231xxx  secretion over life span cycles
between dramatic highs and lows and the secretory
increase in human children at about 6–8 years of age is
referred to as adrenarche (hornsby, 1995), responsible in
part for the appearance of pubic and axillary hair
(\pubarche"), and perhaps the \mid-growth" spurt experienced by humans (bogin, 1997).

study species: papionins
papionins are a tribe of cercopithecine primates that
include the genera macaca (macaques), papio (baboons),
lophocebus (‘arboreal’ mangabeys), theropithecus (geladas),
cercocebus (‘terrestrial’ mangabeys), and mandrillus (mandrills and drills). these primates occupy wide geographical
ranges in africa, europe, and asia, and live in small to
large single-male or multi-male social groups (whitehead

and jolly, 2000). they span a wide range of body mass (5
kg, macaca fascicularis, to over 30 kg, mandrillus sphinx)
(table 1), and many extinct cercopithecines were larger
than related living genera (delson, 1975). taken together,
the fossil evidence suggests there have been several episodes of size change within the recent evolutionary history
of the papionins (fig. 3). speciﬁcally, it suggests that body
size increase in at least two extant lineages (papio and
theropithecus) may result from size change in different
directions: size increase in extant papio compared to fossil
forms and size increase followed by decrease in theropithecus (delson et al., 2000; jablonski, 2002). it is therefore of
interest to determine whether or not the ontogenetic mechanisms responsible for the development of large body size
among papionin lineages are similar.

materials
all samples and measurements used in this study were
obtained from captive animals (table 2). mixed-longitudinal samples were obtained from olive baboons (papio
hamadryas anubis) and sooty mangabeys (cercocebus
atys), twice a year, in june and december, for 5 years
(figs. 4 and 5). all other samples are cross-sectional. a
total of 560 serum samples were collected from 161 individuals (table 2). the papio h. anubis individuals are part
of a larger pedigreed population used in genetics research,
housed in outdoor enclosures at the southwest national
primate research center (snprc) (san antonio, tx), in
groups including adult males and females and juveniles.
breeding is controlled, although none of the individuals in
this study was ovariectomized, or were on any type of contraceptive agent during the course of the study. the cercocebus atys individuals sampled for this study are housed
in indoor/outdoor enclosures at the yerkes national primate research center (ynprc) (atlanta, ga). the study
animals are part of a larger breeding colony, consisting of
individuals of both sexes and various age classes. no

study represent three extended pedigrees, and the mangabeys used in this study are derived from six different matrilines. there is no genetic relationship between the three baboon pedigrees, and relations among the mangabey matrilines are unknown. since paternity information is not yet
available for the mangabeys used in this study, the kinship
coefﬁcient estimates calculated from the matrilines are
limited in their accuracy. the nonzero kinship coefﬁcients
for both baboons and mangabeys range from *0.0625 to
*0.25. for each kinship pair, estimates of average hormone values were regressed on kinship coefﬁcients to
determine whether higher degrees of similarity in hormone levels could be predicted by higher kinship coefﬁcients. for both baboons and mangabeys, there was no
signiﬁcant positive relationship between hormone levels
and kinship coefﬁcients (data not shown). therefore,
while most of the individuals from these two populations
have one or more relatives included in the study, relatedness shows no apparent effects on the hormone values
analyzed.
cross-sectional samples were obtained from individuals
housed at various zoological and research institutions
(table 2, fig. 6), derived either from banked collections,
routine veterinary examinations, or both. the housing
environments differ among these institutions, from openair exhibits, to completely indoor enclosures, to a combination of indoor and outdoor enclosures. additionally, the
presence of other individuals also varies across these institutions, from singly housed animals to large group enclosures. examination of the data for outliers and associations with differences in housing or social conditions do
not reveal any signiﬁcant associations (data not shown).
therefore, while these differences are important, they

degree warranting data separation. isis (international
species information system) sheets accompanied each
sample, which include records of any behavioral or health
problems. in any case where the animal had been subjected to physical trauma or illness, the data from that
sample were not used in the analyses.

methods
hormone analyses
radioimmunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
and immunoradiometric assay techniques were used to
quantify hormones in the collected sera. these methods
allow for precise measurement of hormones, even at very
low concentrations (christopolous and diamandis, 1996).
to analyze levels of  xxxg1144xxx , it is ﬁrst necessary to dissociate
 xxxg1144xxx  from its binding proteins (daughaday et al., 1987).
previous analyses of  xxxg1144xxx  in primate sera have utilized radioimmunoassay; however, most of these studies separate
the  xxxg1144xxx  fraction by using acid-ethanol precipitation
(crawford et al., 1992). while this method is less timeconsuming, acid chromatography is the method by which
reference values are established (scott et al., 1985), and
was the method used for the present study. protocols for
chromatography and  xxxg1144xxx  assay follow those outlined in
donovan et al. (1994). igfbp-3, ghbp, dhea-s, testosterone, and estradiol are analyzed using commercially available kits, validated for use in the species studied (dsl, webster, tx); details are available in (bernstein, 2004). samples
from all species were analyzed for levels of  xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxg2231xxx ,
testosterone, and estradiol. only c. atys and p. h. anubis
samples were analyzed for igfbp-3 and ghbp levels.

data treatment
all statistical analyses were performed using systat1
version 9 (spss inc., 1998). for comparison of hormone
levels in the ontogenetic p. h. anubis (large-bodied papionin) and c. atys (small-bodied papionin) samples, linear
regressions of log-transformed (base-10) data were compared between the species. speciﬁcally, analyses of covariance (ancova) are used to control for age-related
changes in mass and hormone levels by regressing hormone levels and mass against age. adjusted least squares
means were estimated and compared between the two species, with the expectation that baboons consistently show
larger size and higher hormone concentrations during ontogeny. these samples are mixed longitudinal, meaning
that a single individual can provide more than one data
point to the data set (see materials). this complicates estimation of degrees of freedom in regressions by inﬂating
the degrees of freedom and poses a difﬁcult problem given
the structure of this data set. speciﬁcally, not all individuals contributed data over identical age ranges, a constraint
imposed by the sheer expense and logistical difﬁculties of
sampling individuals longitudinally throughout their
entire growth periods (which in the case of baboons, approaches a decade). we circumvent this problem by setting
a restrictive signiﬁcance level (p < 0.01) for these analyses. similar procedures have been used to cope with this
problem in other contexts (sparks and jantz, 2002).
the hormone values from the cross-sectional adult samples (8 years and older for females, 10 years and older for
males) were log-transformed (base-10), and pooled to obtain mean values for each sex. these were then plotted
against log-transformed average weight values for each
species, split by sex. visual examination of these plots was
utilized to determine whether hormone levels covaried with
body size across taxa. interspeciﬁc pearson correlation analyses with bonferroni corrections were performed for hormone and weight. problems of degrees of freedom are not as
severe in these comparisons, so we use p < 0.05 as a measure of signiﬁcance. finally, we did not undertake extensive
phylogenetic adjustment of adult data, given the structure

of variation of our dataset within genera. preliminary analysis of data with independent contrasts methods using mesquite (maddison and maddison, 2006) indicates that phylogenetic relationships among the taxa do not relate to the
distribution of hormone values (data not shown).
it should be emphasized that we are not examining the
relationship of hormones to growth per se in this study;
instead, we simply explore how hormone levels covary with
body sizes among species. this enables a comparison with
previous studies that make the correlation between larger
size and higher hormone levels in various intraspeciﬁc
studies (reviewed above). hormone levels increase during
development (bernstein, 2004); however, based on studies
outlined above, it is important to ﬁrst examine the basic
assumption that absolute hormone levels are positively
correlated with size, and to test the expectation that regardless of developmental stage, larger species have higher
hormone levels and smaller species have lower hormone levels. this permits a general comparison among species before
examining in more detail the relationship between changes
in hormone levels and ontogeny (bernstein et al., in review).

results
p. h. anubis (baboon) and c. atys (mangabey)
comparison
body mass curves illustrate that baboons are larger
than mangabeys at all ages, in both sexes (figs. 7 and 8), a
result conﬁrmed by adjusted least-squares means for the
two species (table 3). growth occurs in both species at
roughly the same pace, but mangabeys are always smaller
than baboons, resulting in parallel growth curves. mangabeys also reach adult weight slightly earlier than baboons.
despite the fact that there is a positive correlation
between  xxxg1144xxx  and size within each species (fig. 9a,b),
larger-bodied males show marginally, but not signiﬁcantly,
higher  xxxg1144xxx  levels than females (kruskal-wallis: p ¼
0.096 baboons, p ¼ 0.685 mangabeys). the same holds for
ghbp (kruskal-wallis: p ¼ 0.717 baboons, p ¼ 0.057
mangabeys), while igfbp-3 levels are not signiﬁcantly
different between males and females (kruskal-wallis p ¼
0.457 baboons, p ¼ 0.838 mangabeys). in both species,
males have signiﬁcantly higher testosterone levels than
females (kruskal-wallis: p < 0.001 baboons and mangabeys), and females have signiﬁcantly higher estradiol levels than males (kruskal-wallis: p < 0.001 baboons and
mangabeys). mangabey males and females do not show
signiﬁcantly different  xxxg2231xxx  levels (kruskal-wallis p ¼
0.243), but female baboons have signiﬁcantly higher levels
than male baboons (p < 0.001).
adjusted least squares means of mass and hormone levels show a more complicated picture (table 3). despite
their smaller sizes at all points during ontogeny, mangabeys have signiﬁcantly higher  xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp-3 levels
than baboons (p < 0.001 for pooled sexes and females and
males, except p < 0.01 for igfbp-3 in males). in contrast
to results for  xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp-3, baboons have signiﬁcantly higher  xxxg2231xxx  and ghbp levels than mangabeys
(p < 0.001 for both). neither estradiol nor testosterone levels differed signiﬁcantly between these species. these
results suggest that although they have higher mass at all
ages, baboons do not have uniformly higher hormone levels than mangabeys while growing. these results lend
only partial support to the traditional hypothesis, that
larger species have higher levels of circulating growth
related hormones.

papionin adult comparison
the plot of  xxxg1144xxx  against mass for the papionin species
(male samples) illustrates size divisions among taxa (fig.
10). however, there is also an apparent spread along the
y-axis with regard to hormone values among taxa. size
and hormone levels are clearly independent, with large
species often showing lower levels of hormones than small
species. in addition, hormone levels vary substantially
among subspecies of baboons (guinea (p. h. papio) versus
olive (p. h. anubis) baboons). although guinea baboons
tend to be smaller than olive baboons (smith and
jungers, 1997), they show higher levels of  xxxg1144xxx  as
adults. similarly, interspeciﬁc variability characterizes
mandrillus, with substantial differences between drills
(m. leucophaeus) and mandrills (m. sphinx). similarly

large differences in hormone levels contrast mangabey
species (c. torquatus, c. atys). size and  xxxg1144xxx  levels appear to be independent in adult male papionins.
females are smaller than males across the taxa studied, but the species studied still fall out into larger- and
smaller-bodied groups (see fig. 11). in contrast to expectations of the traditional hypothesis, smaller species have
higher levels of  xxxg1144xxx  levels than the larger species. regression shows a negative relation between size and  xxxg1144xxx  levels, but the relation is not signiﬁcant (table 4). large bodied
species predominate in this analysis, and these show a
greater range of  xxxg1144xxx  values than the smaller-bodied species. within various genera, high levels of variation are
observed for cercocebus, but both mandrillus and papio
seem to present relatively low levels of variation, in contrast
to hat is seen for males of the same species.

an examination of the relationship of  xxxg2231xxx  with size
among male papionin species shows a positive but nonsigniﬁcant relationship (fig. 12, table 4). large-bodied
species vary widely in terms of  xxxg2231xxx  values, with substantial variation within genera (especially papio and
mandrillus).  xxxg2231xxx  also shows a positive but not signiﬁcant relationship with size among the females studied
(fig. 13, table 4). however, these results should be interpreted with caution given the presence of only one smaller
species in this sample, as well as the unequal age distribution of samples across all species. estradiol varies independent of size among female papionins, with marked variation present in mandrillus and papio species (fig. 14).
likewise, testosterone does not covary with size among
males (fig. 15), but here again, we see substantial variation within papio.

both during ontogeny and during the adult period. this
ﬁnding stands in contrast to that of generally accepted
research, especially on  xxxg1144xxx , based on analyses of single
species characterized by substantial size differences.
these studies almost uniformly indicate positive covariance between hormone levels and size (cf. eigenmann
et al., 1984). consequently, traditional hypotheses about
the relationship between size and hormone levels do not
predict variation among papionin primate species.
instead, our analyses strongly—but perhaps indirectly—

support recent studies that identify important roles for
autocrine and paracrine modes of hormone action (le
roith et al., 2001). moreover, ontogenetic data support
the idea that species differences in hormone levels are
established comparatively early in life, with relative hormone levels corresponding between adults and juveniles.
for example, mangabeys have relatively high levels of
 xxxg1144xxx  at all points during ontogeny relative to baboons,
and maintain elevated levels throughout the adult period
(leigh and bernstein, in press).
although there is a long history of research investigating the effects of  xxxg1144xxx  on growth and size, only recently
with knockout experiments has it become apparent that
the long-standing idea, that higher  xxxg1144xxx  levels are
always correlated with larger size, is untenable. we
hypothesize that contrasts among experimental and traditional studies, and the deviations of our results from
the predictions of the hypothesis based on traditional,
intraspeciﬁc studies can be explained by differences in
selective regimes and in how selection has affected the
relationship between size and hormones. speciﬁcally, size

differences within species, such as those addressed by
classic studies of circulating  xxxg1144xxx , may have been produced by following common developmental pathways to
different endpoints, as indicated by our ontogenetic analyses showing a positive correlation between size and  xxxg1144xxx . comparisons of larger and smaller animals within each
species would conﬁrm a traditional hypothesis, because
body size differences are correlated with hormone level
differences. more speciﬁcally, our ontogenetic comparisons indicate that larger forms (within species) tend to
reach different endpoints along a common size/hormone
trajectory (see bernstein et al., in review), but size differences among species are correlated with early hormone
differences. these early hormone differences are best
illustrated by comparisons of baboons and mangabeys,
showing that smaller mangabeys always have higher levels of  xxxg1144xxx . such results indicate that multiple hormonal
processes are responsible for size differences among species. moreover, although we lack ontogenetic data for all
papionin species, our analyses of adults support a conclusion of multiple ways of hormonal involvement in ontog-

eny. this is most clearly reﬂected by differences within
genera and species in terms of hormone levels.
the contrast between the present study and older studies on the relationship between circulating hormones and
size, and hence the lack of compelling support for traditional size-hormone relationships, may stem from the fact
that the size variation in many of the animal models that
were used to examine the relationship between hormones
and size occurred precisely because of selection on body
size, growth rate, or hormone levels speciﬁcally. for example, eigenmann’s work on dogs found that body weight
was positively correlated with  xxxg1144xxx  levels (eigenmann
et al., 1988). however, hormone levels were analyzed in
only fully-grown animals, and it was stated explicitly that
the variation in body size in the poodles used in their
study \is due to artiﬁcial selection for alleles favouring the
desired body size for a given breed" (p. 448). other studies
that document an association between  xxxg1144xxx  levels and
size have used artiﬁcially selected populations of animals
bred for consumption (including chicken and ducks
(farhat and chavez, 2001; tesseraud et al., 2003), cattle
(pagan et al., 2003) and pigs (te pas et al., 2004)). these
ﬁndings are supported by numerous studies using mouse
lines divergently selected on the basis of body weight,
growth rate, and  xxxg1144xxx  levels, all of which show that  xxxg1144xxx 
levels are positively correlated with growth rates and body
size (kroonsberg et al., 1989; siddiqui et al., 1992; hoeﬂich
et al., 1998, 1999). at the same time, other studies on
chicken (goddard et al., 1988), sheep (medrano and bradford, 1991), domestic dog breeds (favier et al., 2001), and
humans (schwartz et al., 1987; baumann et al., 1991)
have not found a clear association between size and  xxxg1144xxx 
levels. these seemingly contradictory ﬁndings are in line
with the result of the present study, and support the idea
that the relationship between size and support the hypothesis of complex and variable relationships between size
and endocrine factors.
to understand the role of hormones in evolutionary size
transformations, it is necessary to consider that they may
not always function similarly across all lineages. changes
in the genetic regulation of  xxxg1144xxx , for example, leading to
lower or higher  xxxg1144xxx  levels, may indeed underlie relatively simple shifts in developmental control (ge et al.,
2001; iida et al., 2005), resulting in ontogenetic scaling, as
suggested by shea and bailey (1996) for mbuti efe and by
shea and colleagues (1987) for giant transgenic mice:
however, genetic differences in growth potential can also
be understood as resulting from changes in the response of
target tissues (duclos et al., 1996). indeed, the lowered circulating  xxxg1144xxx  levels in the mbuti efe are thought to result from decreased numbers of  xxxd3223xxx  receptors,
consequently leading to lowered ghbp levels (baumann
et al., 1989). nonetheless, the physiological regulation of
size change may not be as simple as increasing or decreasing hormone levels. where size and shape variation are
results of complex scaling patterns, the endocrine correlates of these changes may be more complicated than previously recognized. as such, the ﬁnding that  xxxg1144xxx  and
igfbp-3 levels are not clearly positively related to size in
papionins might be expected, given the complex selection
hypothesized to have given rise to the size variation in this
clade (leigh et al., 2003). in other words, size (and associated shape) variation in papionins might not have resulted
from selection on size speciﬁcally. in lineages where selection acts explicitly on size, growth rates, or even  xxxg1144xxx  levels, though, we might expect to ﬁnd the classic  xxxg1144xxx : size
correlation.

dissociation of size from hormone levels among papionin species strongly corroborates ﬁndings of recent experimental work involving mice with disrupted liver-speciﬁc
 xxxg1144xxx  production. speciﬁcally, experimental research suggests that liver derived endocrine  xxxg1144xxx  is not essential
for postnatal growth (butler and leroith 2001, the ‘somatomedin hypothesis 2000’), implying that  xxxg1144xxx  produced by extrahepatic tissues is sufﬁcient for gh-stimulated postnatal growth. because the current study does
not address  xxxg1144xxx  production in, or action at the target
tissues, we are unable to evaluate this possibility directly.
however, our documentation of dissociation between a
strict positive relationship between circulating levels of
 xxxg1144xxx  and body size are entirely compatible with this hypothesis. it is of interest that this study has supported
the conclusions based on experimental mouse models,
even though the postnatal growth in the experimental
animals is somewhat abnormal (ohlsson, 2002). the current research demonstrates that the ﬁndings of this type
of experimental work, which would be extremely difﬁcult
to conduct using primates, are conﬁrmed when examined
across several primate species that vary in size. in addition, the results of this study suggest that the ﬁndings of
such experimental work can be informative for evolutionary studies. compatibility with the ‘somatomedin hypothesis 2000’ implies that numerous factors are likely to be
important for explaining how circulating levels of hormones relate to growth and size.
although preliminary phylogenetic independent contrasts analysis does not reveal any signiﬁcant effect of
phylogeny on hormone levels, our results are suggestive
of such an inﬂuence. for example, theropithecus, lophocebus, and papio share similar, lower levels of  xxxg1144xxx 
when compared to mandrillus and cercocebus, which
share similar, higher levels of  xxxg1144xxx , although there are
some differences between species within the genera.
macaca shares lower levels with the papio/theropithecus/
lophocebus clade. this suggests that the higher  xxxg1144xxx 
levels in the mandrillus/cercocebus clade are derived,
and that papio, theropithecus, and lophocebus retain
the presumed primitive condition of lower  xxxg1144xxx  levels.
further analyses with more extensive datasets may bring
this aspect of the results into clearer focus.

other hormones
analyses of ghbp, in contrast to  xxxg1144xxx , support the
expectations of the hypothesis, illustrating a size correlation among species. during ontogeny, baboons always had
higher levels than mangabeys. this suggests that in papionins, components of the somatotropic axis are not in agreement with each other with regard to their relationship
with size, similar to the ﬁndings of some studies of constitutionally short human populations. while additional analyses of ghbp are necessary, these preliminary results suggest that it is perhaps the gh-ghr system that is the most
closely tied to size in this clade, rather than  xxxg1144xxx -igfbp-3.
the ﬁnding that  xxxg2231xxx  is also higher in larger-bodied
baboons compared to mangabeys, and the suggested postive
relationship between  xxxg2231xxx  and size among all papionin
adults, suggests that this hormone may also be important
for understanding size differences. previous studies which
have linked  xxxg2231xxx  levels to either aging or the uniqueness
of the human growth trajectory have not suggested such a
relationship, but the potential role of  xxxg2231xxx  in the ‘midgrowth’ spurt in humans indicates that it may be related in
some way to the generation of size differences. with regard

american journal of physical anthropology—doi 10.1002/ajpa

papionin hormones and size evolution
to estradiol and testosterone, the lack of signiﬁcant differences among the growing baboons and mangabeys, and the
lack of a correlation in the adult papionins, implies that the
role of these hormones in papionin size differences may not
be direct but rather through the actions of these hormones
on  xxxd3223xxx  secretion and release patterns.

hormone function
generally speaking, the hormones that are involved in
somatic growth also have other, important functions
throughout the lifespan. the hormones analyzed by this
study have many functions, most notably those relating
to reproduction. these hormones are have multiple
effects on an array of targets, and it is therefore essential
to consider their various functions in order to understand
why growth related hormones may vary independently of
size, as well as why the traditional hormone-size hypothesis was not uniformly supported by our results.  xxxg1144xxx 
has many and varied properties (dore et al., 1997; suter
et al., 2000; cittadini et al., 2001; withers, 2001;
ben-shlomo et al., 2003; ballard et al., 2005; larsson
et al., 2005). estradiol and testosterone also have multifactorial effects (dufty, 1989; clark and galef, 1995; rose
and bradley, 1998; cardona-gomez et al., 2002; waters
et al., 2000; wise et al., 2001).  xxxg2231xxx  has many functions as well (roberts et al., 1987; majewska, 1992; herrington, 1995; morley et al., 1997; whitten and turner,
2000). such functional diversity may help to explain why
some growth related hormones vary independently of size
among different species. for example, differences in  xxxg1144xxx  levels could relate to the healing properties of this hormone (cittadini, 2001), if there were high levels of intraspeciﬁc competition leading to frequent wounds, and differential selection of healing abilities. additionally, since
 xxxg1144xxx  may play a role in the onset of puberty (hiney
et al., 1996), earlier onset of higher levels may act to facilitate an earlier onset of sexual maturation, which may in
turn result in a lengthening of the reproductive life span.
decreased testosterone levels may reﬂect a need to preserve immune system function at the expense of the development of secondary sexual characteristics (rose and
bradley, 1998). in short, the results of this study coupled
with the information available about the varied properties of the hormones analyzed, should caution researchers
against thinking of the relationship between hormones
and size in a 1:1 manner and argues against a simplistic
scenario describing the role of hormones in evolutionary
size transformations.

conclusions
this study addressed longstanding ideas about the
relationship between hormone levels (in particular, hormones involved in the somatotropic axis) and body size. it
utilized cross-sectional and mixed longitudinal samples to
investigate whether larger-bodied papionins have absolutely higher hormone levels than smaller bodied papionins, both during development and as adults. by comparing levels across twelve papionin species, this study provides an interspeciﬁc approach to complement and extend
previous single species studies addressing this issue.
the results of this study suggest that previous research, which demonstrated a positive relationship between
hormone (particularly,  xxxg1144xxx  and ghbp) levels and size,
may not apply for lineages where size change has occurred

257

rapidly and as the result of varying scaling patterns. speciﬁcally, our results show that some smaller-bodied papionin species have higher absolute hormone levels than
larger-bodied species. we propose that absolute hormone
levels during growth and adulthood may be decoupled
from interspeciﬁc differences in body size. our results also
support recent ﬁndings of experimental research that indicates that the majority of circulating  xxxg1144xxx , in particular,
may not be necessary for the attainment of normal body
size. finally, we offer that variation in hormone levels not
relating to size may reﬂect the pleiotropic properties of the
hormones studied.
as a ﬁnal point, while this study focused on hormone
levels and their differences among papionin taxa, it is evident that there are clear overall patterns of hormone level
changes with age. in other words, hormone levels increase
during growth in the ontogenetic sample. however, absolute hormone levels before, during, or after growth did not
necessarily relate in any simple way to ﬁnal adult size
(higher hormone levels do not necessarily equal larger animals). whether or not there are species differences in the
more speciﬁc relationship of changing hormone levels to
growth in mass and length, for example, is a subject
addressed elsewhere (see bernstein et al., in review).
