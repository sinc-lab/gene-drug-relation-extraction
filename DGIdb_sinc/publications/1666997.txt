[preclinical pharmacology of  xxxd160xxx  and amitriptyline. implications of serotoninergic and opiodergic systems in their central effect in rats].  the effects of two antidepressant drugs,  xxxd160xxx  and amitriptyline, that belong to distinct chemical classes, have been examined on various biochemical parameters related to serotoninergic and opioidergic neurotransmission in the rat brain and spinal cord. in vitro binding studies showed that both  xxxd160xxx  and amitriptyline interact in the nanomolar range with 5-ht2 receptors labelled by [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in cortical membranes. by contrast, neither  xxxd160xxx  nor amitriptyline can be considered as possible ligands of 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b receptors because their affinities for these sites are in the micromolar range (or even worse). interestingly,  xxxd160xxx  binds with a good affinity (ic50 = 0.30 microm) to 5-ht3 receptors labelled by [3h]zacopride in cortical membranes. complementary experiments using the 5-ht3-dependent bezold-jarisch reflex confirmed that  xxxd160xxx  really acts in vivo as a 5-ht3 antagonist (ic50 = 50 micrograms/kg i.v.), whereas amitriptyline is essentially inactive on 5-ht3 receptors. the second part of this study consisted of looking for possible changes in central 5-ht receptors 24 h after either a single or a repeated (for 14 days) treatment with  xxxd160xxx  (10 mg/kg i.p. each day) or amitriptyline (10 mg/kg i.p.). a marked decrease in the density of 5-ht2 receptors was found in the cerebral cortex in both treatment groups. by contrast, neither 5-ht1a nor 5-ht1b receptors were significantly affected in any brain region studied. finally we explored whether acute and/or chronic administration of  xxxd160xxx  or amitriptyline affected the levels of opioid peptides and the mu and delta classes of opioid receptors in various regions of the brain and the spinal cord.(abstract truncated at 250 words).
