crystal structure of  xxxg1562xxx , a cysteine desulfurase from escherichia coli.   xxxg1562xxx  is a widely distributed cysteine desulfurase that catalyzes the  xxxd3047xxx -dependent desulfuration of l-cysteine and plays a central role in the delivery of sulfur to a variety of metabolic pathways. we report the crystal structure of escherichia coli  xxxg1562xxx  to a resolution of 2.1a. the crystals belong to the space group p2(1)2(1)2(1) and have unit cell dimensions a=73.70a, b=101.97a, c=108.62a (alpha=beta=gamma=90 degrees ). molecular replacement with the thermotoga maritima  xxxg1562xxx  model was used to determine phasing, and the  xxxg1562xxx  model was refined to an r=20.6% (r(free)=23.6%) with two molecules per asymmetric unit. the structure of e.coli  xxxg1562xxx  is similar to that of t.maritima  xxxg1562xxx  with nearly identical secondary structure and an overall backbone r.m.s. difference of 1.4a. however, in contrast to  xxxg1562xxx  a peptide segment containing the catalytic cysteine residue (cys328) is partially ordered in the  xxxg1562xxx  structure. this segment of  xxxg1562xxx  (residues 323-335) forms a surface loop directed away from the active site pocket. cys328 is positioned greater than 17a from the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor, suggesting that a large conformational change must occur during catalysis in order for cys328 to participate in nucleophilic attack of a  xxxd3047xxx -bound cysteine substrate. modeling suggests that rotation of this loop may allow movement of cys328 to within approximately 3a of the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor.
