b-amyloid plaques (ab plaques) in the brain, containing
predominantly fibrillary ab peptide aggregates, represent a defining pathologic feature of  xxxg178xxx  (ad). imaging
agents targeting the ab plaques in the living human brain are potentially valuable as biomarkers of pathogenesis processes in
ad. (e)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-18f-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin3-yl)vinyl)-n-methyl benzenamine ( xxxd2116xxx ) is such as an
agent currently in phase iii clinical studies for pet of ab plaques
in the brain. methods: in vitro binding of  xxxd2116xxx  to ab plaques
in the postmortem ad brain tissue was evaluated by in vitro binding assay and autoradiography. in vivo biodistribution of 18f-av45 in mice and ex vivo autoradiography of ad transgenic mice
(appswe/ xxxg1857xxx ) with ab aggregates in the brain were performed. small-animal pet of a monkey brain after an intravenous
injection of  xxxd2116xxx  was evaluated. results:  xxxd2116xxx  displayed a high binding affinity and specificity to ab plaques (kd,
3.72 6 0.30 nm). in vitro autoradiography of postmortem human
brain sections showed substantial plaque labeling in ad brains
and not in the control brains. initial high brain uptake and rapid
washout from the brain of healthy mice and monkey were observed. metabolites produced in the blood of healthy mice after
an intravenous injection were identified.  xxxd2116xxx  displayed excellent binding affinity to ab plaques in the ad brain by ex vivo
autoradiography in transgenic ad model mice. the results lend
support that  xxxd2116xxx  may be a useful pet agent for detecting
ab plaques in the living human brain.

lzheimer disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disease
showing an increasingly high incidence in the older
population. the presence of b-amyloid plaques (ab
plaque) in the brain is a defining pathologic feature for
this disease (1,2). currently, the definitive method to
diagnose ad requires the presence of dementia in patients

and, in addition, postmortem histopathology to demonstrate
the presence of neuritic plaques, containing predominantly
the ab aggregates, and neurofibrillary tangles, predominantly composed of aggregates of t-protein. pet of ab
aggregates in the living human brain may serve as a helpful
tool for the diagnosis of ad in living subjects.
many diverse approaches are being pursued in the quest
to obtain a definite diagnosis of ad in living patients.
imaging methods have been used to study structural and
functional changes of the brain in the patients with ad,
including mri-based measures of regional brain atrophy.
changes of entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volumes
may also be useful for measuring changes in images
associated with ad (3). regional changes in glucose metabolism in the brain, as measured by 18f-fdg pet, can be
used to evaluate patients with ad (4,5). however, neither
18f-fdg pet and regional blood flow nor other anatomic
imaging studies (mri) can specifically determine the principal and defining pathologic features of ad, that is, the
presence neuritic plaques and neurofilbrillary tangles in the
brain. a lipophilic tracer, 18f-fddnp, for binding to both
tangles and plaques has been reported (6). studies in
humans suggested that 18f-fddnp showed a higher retention in regions of brain suspected of having both tangles
and plaques (7). the in vivo selectivity of 18f-fddnp
remains to be fully established. because it binds to both
plaques (ab aggregates) and tangles (t-aggregates) in vitro,
it does not selectively recognize a specific pathologic
component of ad.
the development of small, neutral, and moderately
lipophilic agents targeting ab aggregates in the living
human brain was successfully demonstrated using thioflavin t or stilbene as the core structure (8,9). the most
commonly known ligands for ab aggregates are listed in
figure 1. among them, 11c-labeled pittsburgh  xxxd1751xxx 
(a thioflavin t derivative, pib), has been most widely
studied. pib showed an excellent initial brain uptake and
a high binding affinity to ab plaques (10–12). a wealth of
clinical information has been reported using 11c-pib, and
several reports have suggested that there is a correlation of
pet images and the presence of ab aggregates in the living

human brain and postmortem brain tissue samples (13–16).
because 11c has a short physical half-life (t1/2 5 20 min),
a comparable 18f-labeled tracer (t1/2 5 110 min) will be
more useful to expand the applicability of pet in a wider
patient population. an 18f-labeled pib derivative, 18f-39-fpib (ge-067) (fig. 1), has also been reported (13,17), and
it is currently under a phase ii clinical trial in europe,
sponsored by ge healthcare. it was reported recently that
123i-impy may be useful as a spect agent targeting ab
plaques in the brain (18,19). preliminary clinical data of
123i-impy in healthy and ad patients showed a distinct
distribution pattern similar to that of 11c-pib. however, the
signal-to-noise ratio for plaque labeling is not robust (20,21).
because of the fast brain and plasma clearance observed in
ad and in healthy subjects, the in vivo metabolism and
instability of 123i-impy may not provide an optimal signalto-noise ratio. additional candidates are being explored for
spect of ab plaques in the brain (22,23).
previously, stilbene derivatives were identified as ligands
that showed a high binding affinity to preformed ab
aggregates (24). the rigid structures of stilbene and
styrylpyridine have provided core structures for developing
many specific imaging agents for ab plaques (25–29). a
small and neutral stilbene derivative, 11c-sb-13 (fig. 1),
was prepared and demonstrated an excellent binding
affinity. in addition, in vitro autoradiography of 11c-sb13 displayed excellent labeling of ab plaques densely

populated on postmortem ad brain sections (30). a
preliminary human study using 11c-sb-13 for pet
showed excellent differential increased uptake and retention in the frontal cortex (in which ab plaques are
notably located) of ad patients, as compared with control
subjects (31). despite its success in detecting ab plaques
in the living human brain by pet, no further patient
studies using 11c-sb-13 were performed. technical demands associated with producing and performing pet of
a 11c tracer limit its widespread clinical application. this
situation provided incentives to search for alternative sb13 derivatives suitably labeled with 18f. initial attempts on
developing 18f-labeled sb-13 by adding a fluoroalkyl
substitution group on either end of sb-13 were met with
little success. these sb-13 derivatives were too lipophilic
and showed high nonspecific binding in the healthy brain.
to overcome this problem of too high lipophilicity and
to provide a simple 18f labeling procedure, a series of
fluoropegylated stilbene derivatives was successfully prepared and tested (26,27,32). there are 2 structurally
similar fluoropegylated agents that are currently being
developed commercially: bay 94-9172 (av-1, in phase ii
clinical trials by schering/bayer) (33) and  xxxd2116xxx 
(av-45, in phase iii clinical trials by avid radiopharmaceuticals). currently, three 18f tracers targeting ab
aggregates (bay 94-9172, ge-067, and av-45) are in
active commercial development.

reported herein is the preclinical characterization of 18fav-45 as an ab plaque imaging agent. in vitro binding
studies of  xxxd2116xxx  with postmortem ad brain tissue
homogenates were performed to determine the binding
affinity (kd) and density (bmax). autoradiography of human
brain sections using  xxxd2116xxx  and ex vivo autoradiography of transgenic mice specially engineered to produce
excess ab plaques was evaluated to establish the selectivity
of the binding to ab plaques. biodistribution studies in
healthy mice (male and female) were performed to measure
the brain penetration and kinetics of brain washout.
metabolites of  xxxd2116xxx  after an intravenous injection
into healthy mice were found, and their potential for brain
penetration and binding to ab plaque was investigated.
materials and methods
general
all reagents used for chemical synthesis were commercial
products and were used without further purification. synthesis of
precursors and related derivatives was accomplished by previously
reported procedures. two major metabolites (av-160 and av-267)
were prepared and characterized using schemes similar to those
reported for  xxxd2116xxx  (supplemental information; supplemental
materials are available online only at http://jnm.snmjournals.org)
(29). cd-1mice (20–26 g, male and female) were used for
biodistribution studies. transgenic mice (appswepsen1) were
purchased from jackson laboratory. all protocols requiring the
use of mice were reviewed and approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee (university of pennsylvania and
university of the sciences in philadelphia). postmortem human
samples were obtained from national disease research interchange. small-animal pet protocols for monkeys were approved
by the institutional animal care and use committee, university
of michigan.
radiosynthesis of  xxxd2116xxx 
 xxxd2116xxx  was prepared using a method reported previously
(29). briefly, 18f-fluoride ion trapped on an anion exchange cartridge (purchased from ortg, inc.) was eluted to the reaction
vessel using 1 ml of aqueous solution consisting of potassium
carbonate (50 mg) and kryptofix (100 mg) in a mixture of h2o
(4 ml) and mecn (10 ml). the water in the eluted activities was
removed by heating to 70c under a stream of helium and under
vacuum, and this process was repeated to yield anhydrous
kryptofix (sigma chemicals)/k2co3/18f-fluoride. approximately
1 mg of o-tosylated precursor for making  xxxd2116xxx  was
dissolved in 1 ml of anhydrous  xxxd1896xxx  and added
to the reactor mixture containing the anhydrous 18f-fluoride
prepared above. the reaction mixture was heated to 120c for
10 min and then cooled to 50c before the addition of 0.25 ml of
10% hcl in high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc)–
grade water. the mixture was heated to 120c for 5 min. after
cooling to 50c, a 0.33-ml portion of 10% naoh and 5-ml
hplc-grade water were added. the solution was loaded onto
a sep-pak light c18 column (waters) and washed further with
5 ml of hplc water; the desired  xxxd2116xxx  was eluted with 1 ml
of mecn into a reservoir containing 2 ml of hplc solvent (55%
mecn:45% 20 mm aqueous nh4oac with 0.5% w/v ascorbic
acid sodium salt) and 1 ml of hplc water. the crude mixture

was then loaded onto a semipreparative hplc column (eclipse
xdb-c18; zorbax) (5 mm, 9.4 · 250 mm; flow rate, 4 ml/min).
the hplc fraction containing the desired  xxxd2116xxx  was collected into another reservoir containing 15 ml of hplc water and
passed through a preconditioned sep-pak light c-18, which was
further washed with 15 ml of sterile water for an injection
containing 0.5% w/v  xxxd228xxx  sodium salt. the final product,
 xxxd2116xxx , was eluted with 1 ml of ethanol (united states
pharmacopeia [usp] for injection) into 9 ml of  xxxd3213xxx 
injection (sterile, usp) containing 0.5% w/v  xxxd228xxx  sodium
salt (usp).  xxxd2116xxx  was routinely prepared with a 10%230%
radiochemical yield, a high specific activity (.37,000–185,000
mbq/mmol [.1,000–5,000 ci/mmol]), and a high radiochemical
purity (.99%).
in vitro binding studies of  xxxd2116xxx 
gray matter of frozen ad brain samples were homogenized
with a tissue homogenizer in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs).
tissue homogenates were diluted to 50–100 mg/ml and frozen at
280c until used for binding assays. competitive binding assays
were performed in 12 · 75 mm borosilicate glass tubes. the
reaction mixture contained 200 ml of ad brain homogenates (20–
25 mg),  xxxd2116xxx  (0.04–0.06 nm diluted in pbs), and 100 ml of
competing compounds (1025 to 10210 m diluted serially in pbs
containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ) in a final volume of
0.5 ml. nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of
bta-1 (fig. 1) (8 mm) in the same assay tubes. the mixture was
incubated for 2 h at 37c, and the bound and the free radioactivity
were separated by vacuum filtration through whatman gf/b
filters using a brandel m-24r cell harvester, followed by washing
with pbs buffer 3 times. filters containing the bound  xxxd2116xxx 
were assayed for radioactivity in a g-counter (wizard 3$ 1480
automatic g-counter; perkin elmer). under the assay conditions,
the specifically bound fraction was less than 15% of the total
radioactivity. the results of inhibition experiments were subjected
to nonlinear regression analysis using ebda (elsevier-biosoft) by
which inhibition constant (ki) and kd values were calculated.
biodistribution
cd-1 mice (20–26 g, male and female) were injected with 18fav-45 (370 kbq [10 mci], 150 ml formulated in 10% ethanol and
90% saline with 0.5%  xxxd228xxx ) directly into the tail vein. the
mice were sacrificed by cardiac puncture under isoflurane anesthesia at various time points (2, 60, 120, and 180 min) after the
injection. organs of interest were removed and weighed, and the
radioactivity was counted with a g-counter. the injected percentage dose per organ was calculated by a comparison of the tissue
counts to suitably diluted aliquots of the injected material. each
time point consisted of a group of 3 animals.
ex vivo autoradiography of transgenic mouse brain
under anesthesia, the transgenic mice (b6.cg-tg [appswepsen1]; age, 25 mo) were injected with 18,500 kbq (500 mci) of
 xxxd2116xxx  into the tail vein. for ex vivo autoradiography, a higher
dose (500 mci) was used so that there would be sufficient counts
in the brain for exposing the film. the mice were sacrificed at
30 min after tracer injection. brains were removed and cut into
20-mm sections. the brain sections were exposed to kodax biomax
mri film overnight. after the film was developed, the images
were digitized.

in vitro autoradiography of ad brain sections
frozen brains from ad and control subjects were cut into
20-mm sections. the sections were incubated with  xxxd2116xxx  in
40% ethanol at a concentration of 0.3 nm for 1 h. the sections
were then dipped in saturated li2co3 in 40% ethanol (2-min wash
twice) and washed with 40% ethanol (2-min wash once), followed
by rinsing with water for 30 s. after drying, the sections were
exposed to kodax biomax mri film for 12–18 h. after the film
was developed, the images were digitized.
thioflavin s staining
brain sections were immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
for 1 h, and autofluorescence was quenched by treatment with
0.05% kmno4 and bleaching in 0.2% k2s2o5/0.2%  xxxd2802xxx .
quenched tissue sections were stained with 0.025% thioflavin s in
40% ethanol for 3–5 min. sections were differentiated in 50%
ethanol and viewed using a nikon e800 fluorescence microscope
with a charge-coupled device digital camera.
metabolite analysis
between 370 and 555 mbq (10 and 15 mci) of  xxxd2116xxx  were
injected into the tail vein of healthy mice. the mice were
sacrificed at 2, 10, 30, or 60 min after the injection. the blood
samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 2 min to separate
plasma. plasma samples were mixed with equal volumes of
acetonitrile followed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min to
remove the denatured proteins. the supernatant was then analyzed
directly by hplc. the hplc analysis was performed on an
eclipse xdb-c18 column (4.6 · 150 mm) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid water and acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min.
for the determination of  xxxd2116xxx  and its metabolites in the
liver and brain, liver and brain were excised and cut into small
parts. the tissues were homogenized in 2 ml of pbs and
acetonitrile mixture. the homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000
rpm for 3 min. the supernatant was separated from the tissue
pellet, the entire supernatant was concentrated under the stream of
n2 gas, and 0.1 ml was analyzed using hplc in the same way as
described for plasma. the retention times under these conditions
were approximately 2.2, 4.1, and 7.3 min for polar metabolites;
11.5 min for 18f-av-160; 12.4 min for  xxxd2116xxx ; and 15.3 min
for 18f-av-267.
monkey small-animal pet
a young adult female rhesus monkey (6.65 kg) was anesthetized (isoflurane) and intubated, a venous catheter was inserted
into 1 hindlimb, and the animal was positioned on the bed of the
concorde micropet p4 gantry. isoflurane anesthesia was continued throughout the study. after completion of the transmission
scan, the animal was injected with  xxxd2116xxx  (173.9 mbq [4.7
mci]; specific activity, 71,262 mbq/mmol [1,926 ci/mmol]; in 3
ml of 95% isotonic saline and 5% ethanol) as a bolus over 1 min.
emission data were collected for 90 min (frames, 5 · 2 min, 10 ·
5 min, and 3 · 10 min), corrected for attenuation and scatter, and
reconstructed using the 3-dimensional maximum a priori method.
regions of interest (rois) were drawn manually on multiple
planes to obtain volumetric rois for the striatum, thalamus,
cortex, and white matter, using a summed image of the last 3
frames (60- to 90-min data). the volumetric rois were then
applied to the full dynamic dataset to obtain the regional tissue
time–radioactivity data.

in vitro binding studies of  xxxd2116xxx  to ab aggregates
in the ad brain tissue homogenates

an in vitro binding assay was used to measure  xxxd2116xxx 
affinity to ab aggregates in the ad brain tissue homogenates. the inhibition constants (ki, nm) of various agents
against binding of  xxxd2116xxx  to ab aggregates in postmortem ad brain homogenates are presented in figure 1.
 xxxd2116xxx  displayed excellent binding affinity (2.87 6 0.17
nm).
to further evaluate the in vitro binding of  xxxd2116xxx  to
ab aggregates in postmortem ad brain homogenates,
a series of saturation binding experiments was performed.
results of saturation binding of this 18f tracer in postmortem ad brain homogenates suggested that the binding
is specific and saturable. scatchard analysis suggested that
the binding fitted to a single binding site (fig. 2). four
different ad brain homogenates were tested. the averages
of the kd and bmax for these samples were 3.72 6 0.30 nm
and 8,811 6 1,643 fmol/mg protein, respectively.
the kinetics of association and dissociation of  xxxd2116xxx 
with ab aggregates in postmortem ad brain homogenates
were also evaluated (fig. 3). it was determined that the
koff 5 0.045 6 0.006 min21 and the kon 5 0.034 min21/nm;
assuming kd 5 koff/kon, then kd 5 1.31 nm. data presented
in figure 3 suggested that the tracer binding to ad brain
homogenates was reversible and the kd derived by this kinetic
measurement was comparable to that measured by saturation
binding assay.
autoradiography of postmortem brain tissue sections

when confirmed healthy and ad brain sections were
incubated with  xxxd2116xxx , the resulting autoradiogram
clearly demonstrated a highly dense labeling by this tracer

transgenic mice (fig. 5) (26,34).
in vivo biodistribution in mice

after an intravenous injection in healthy mice, 18f-av45 showed desirable biodistribution properties for a brain
imaging agent. it entered the brain and reached a peak
concentration of 6.23 percentage injected dose per gram
(%id/g) within 2 min after administration and dropped to
1.84 %id/g within 60 min in female mice and 7.33 %id/g
within 2 min after administration and dropped to 1.88 %id/g
within 60 min in male mice (data included in supplemental
information).  xxxd2116xxx  also distributed to several other
organs; the liver and kidneys showed initial uptake with
washout, whereas the intestines showed accumulation of
radioactivity over time. at 2 min, more than 95% of the
total radioactivity injected was accounted for in various
organs (biodistribution data in male and female mice are
included as supplemental information). the biodistribution
data in mice were comparable to those reported previously
for 11c-pib (10) and 18f-bay 94-9172 (29).

ex vivo autoradiography of transgenic mouse brain

recent success in the development of transgenic mice
specifically engineered to overexpress ab and to generate
ab plaques in the brain has provided a convenient animal
model of ad for the testing of potential pet agents. 18fav-45 was injected intravenously in transgenic mice
(appswe/ xxxg1857xxx ; age, 25 mo), and 30 min after injection
the brains were removed, frozen, and sectioned for autoradiography. autoradiograms of the brain sections showed
a dense labeling of the plaques in the cortical regions and
hippocampus. the labeling of the plaques was confirmed
by costaining with thioflavin s, a dye commonly used for
staining the ab plaques in human brain sections. the
results was comparable to those reported previously for

in vivo metabolism of  xxxd2116xxx  in mice was evaluated
after an intravenous injection (fig. 6). at 30 min after
injection, only 30% of the parent,  xxxd2116xxx , remained in
plasma. the biologic t1/2 of  xxxd2116xxx  in mouse plasma
was estimated to be less than 30 min. metabolite profiling
and identification of the metabolites were done by hplc
with radioactive detection and liquid chromatography/mass
spectroscopy analysis. one of the metabolites in the plasma
was the n-demethylated 18f-av-160, which constituted about
48% at 30 min after injection (fig. 6). the other major
radioactive metabolite was identified as the n-acetylated
derivative 18f-av-267 (fig. 6). these 2 metabolites were
prepared separately and used for further characterization of
their biologic properties such as brain uptake and binding
affinity to ab plaques. when injected intravenously at a tracer
dose to healthy mice, both metabolites showed good brain
uptake, but the uptake was less than that of the parent 18f-av45 (fig. 6). the brain uptake of 18f-av-160 at 2 min after
injection was 4.5 %id/g of tissue, which at 60 min after
injection decreased to 1.8 %id/g; similarly, the brain uptake
of 18f-av-267 was 3.3 %id/g at 2 min and 1.8 %id/g at
60 min after injection. the initial uptake of the parent 18f-av45 was 1.5-fold higher than either of its metabolites. no
significant binding to ab plaques was observed with either of
the metabolites using ad brain-section autoradiography and

the in vitro ad brain homogenate binding assay described
above for  xxxd2116xxx . the inhibition constants of av-160
(ki 5 54 6 5 nm) and av-267 (ki 5 398 6 45 nm) indicate
at least a 20- to 100-fold reduction of binding affinity to ab
plaques in ad brain tissue homogenates, as compared
with that of the nonradioactive version of  xxxd2116xxx  (ki 5
2.87 6 0.17 nm) (fig. 1).

small-animal pet of monkey brain

small-animal pet of  xxxd2116xxx  in the monkey brain
was evaluated after an intravenous injection (173.9 mbq
[4.7 mci]). the brain uptake kinetics (cortex and white
matter) are presented in figure 7. after an intravenous
injection,  xxxd2116xxx  penetrated the intact blood–brain
barrier efficiently, and the activity in the cortex peaked
 xxxd2274xxx  min. the white matter region displayed a good uptake
initially, but the activity washed out quickly. at 20 min
after injection, the radioactivity in the cortex and white
matter regions was similar. it is estimated that at the peak
there was about 4.4% of the injected dose localized in
the brain. this value reflected the fact that  xxxd2116xxx 
readily enters the monkey brain. because there were no
ab plaques in the healthy monkey brain, as expected, 18fav-45 did not display any specific binding or prolonged
retention in the brain.

ad is a progressive and often fatal disease. symptoms
include loss of memory (dementia) and other cognitive
functions essential for maintaining normal daily activities
(35,36). in addition, patients may show psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disturbances. presently, autopsy and
postmortem histologic analysis of the ad patient’s brain
samples is required for a definite diagnosis of the disease.
two major abnormal observations in the histopathologic
examination of ad brain tissues are the hallmarks of this
disease (37,38). the first is the presence of plaques,
predominantly in the cortex and between neurons, produced
by excess ab-amyloid protein aggregates. the second is
the presence of tangles, inside neurons, composed of
hyperphosphorylated t-protein (1,37). it is generally accepted that pet for in vivo determination of these pathologic features will be useful for diagnostic purposes.
in addition to being a disease-defining pathologic marker
of ad, ab plaques are believed to play a significant role
in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the disease. accordingly, various strategies to prevent or reduce the accumulation of ab-amyloid protein aggregates—plaque
burden—are now being pursued for the development of
therapeutics for ad (39). thus, pet agents, such as 18fav-45, not only would assist the diagnosis of patients with
ad but also may play a critical role in the development of
antiplaque drugs by selecting those patients who have ab
plaques in the brain and may benefit from drug treatment
(40).
one of the essential prerequisites for a successful imaging agent for ab plaques in the brain is the ability to
penetrate the intact blood–brain barrier.  xxxd2116xxx  is
a small and moderately lipophilic tracer, and it exhibits
an excellent initial brain uptake in mice. biodistribution
studies in mice also show that the tracer not only has a high
initial brain uptake but also displays fast washout kinetics
from the healthy brain. these are highly desirable properties for a useful brain imaging agent targeting ab plaques.
the favorable brain penetration and fast washout from
healthy brain tissue were also demonstrated in healthy
monkeys by small-animal pet (fig. 7). an attractive combination of a high binding affinity to the ab plaque and fast

figure 7. kinetics of brain uptake and washout in rhesus
monkey after intravenous injection of  xxxd2116xxx  (173.9 mbq
[4.7 mci]) are presented. it is evident that uptake in cortex
peaked  xxxd2274xxx  min, and activity was washed out quickly
thereafter. white matter area also displayed good initial
uptake, and washout rate was also rapid. it is estimated that
brain uptake at peak was about 4.4% of injected dose,
which suggested that  xxxd2116xxx  penetrated normal blood–
brain barrier efficiently.

kinetics for washout from the healthy brain makes this agent
decidedly successful in providing specific pet signals.
many reported ab plaque–targeting ligands, despite their
high binding affinities, do not penetrate the brain, or once
they enter the brain the nonspecific binding is so high that
the agents cannot provide a specific signal for ab plaques.
when  xxxd2116xxx  was injected into transgenic mice in which
abundant ab plaques were specially encoded in the brain,
there was significant labeling of the ab plaques by this
tracer (fig. 5). the results further confirm that  xxxd2116xxx 
selectively binds to the ab plaques in the living brain.
several metabolites of  xxxd2116xxx  were identified in the
blood of healthy mice (fig. 6), and these metabolites were
prepared and tested in healthy mice. they showed good
brain uptake and a rapid washout with low nonspecific
binding to the healthy brain. it is likely that the small
amount of metabolites of  xxxd2116xxx  in the blood will not
affect binding of  xxxd2116xxx  to ab plaques in vivo;
furthermore, the metabolites themselves did not show
specific binding to the ab plaques by in vitro binding
assays. contribution from these metabolites of  xxxd2116xxx 
during pet of the brain may be small.
 xxxd2116xxx  has several unique characteristics that make it
suitable for ab plaque imaging in the living human brain:
excellent binding affinity, as demonstrated by in vitro
binding studies using ad brain homogenates; high selective ab plaque labeling, as demonstrated by in vitro
autoradiography studies using postmortem ad brain sections; and excellent brain penetration and rapid kinetics in
healthy mice and nonhuman primates (data not shown). as
a further advantage, the radiochemistry of  xxxd2116xxx  uses

a nucleophilic 18f-fluoride substitution reaction and deblocking of an n-protecting group, which is a relatively
simple procedure. these features make it likely that
manufacturing sites or radiopharmacies, which currently
have established procedures for distributing clinical doses
of 18f-fdg for nuclear medicine clinics, can readily
produce and distribute  xxxd2116xxx .
one of major focal points of developing ab plaque
imaging in the living human brain is the quantitative
correlation of plaque density with the specific binding
signal measured by pet. currently, there are three 18flabeled ab plaque–specific pet agents, bay 94-9172, ge067, and  xxxd2116xxx , under active commercial development.
human studies are now under way for  xxxd2116xxx  with the
goal of correlating pet with postmortem brain amyloid
plaque pathology, the gold standard for demonstrating the
ab plaque density in the brain.
conclusion

the biodistribution studies of  xxxd2116xxx  showed excellent brain uptake and washout kinetics in mice and monkey.
results of in vitro binding of postmortem ad brain tissue
show an excellent binding profile for detecting ab plaques
in the brain. the findings support the view that this pet
agent may provide a convenient tool to investigate the presence of ab plaques in the brain of living human subjects.
