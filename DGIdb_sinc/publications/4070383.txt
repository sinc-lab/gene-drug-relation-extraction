mason, s. t. chronic administration of type a  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors increases duration of  xxxd3354xxx  anaesthesia in the rat. physiol behav 35(2) 201-203, 1985.--daily intraperitoneal administration for fifteen days of the
mixed type a and type b  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors phenelzine,  xxxd2389xxx , iproniazid and tranylcypromine caused
a marked increase in the duration of  xxxd3354xxx  anaesthesia ('sleeping time') tested 48 hours after the last drug injection.
this effect was not due to accumulation of drug or other carryover since it failed to occur after 5 days of daily administration. similar prolongation of anaesthesia was seen after 15, but not 5 days of administration of the selective type a
 xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors  xxxd1730xxx  and ly 51641 but not with the type b inhibitors  xxxd2850xxx  and deprenyl.

cofactor while tranylcypromine may bind to the - s h group
of this moiety [19].  xxxd2389xxx , iproniazid and phenelzine
may bind to both.

b a r b i t u r a t e anaesthesia is modulated by brain noradrenaline systems [15]. thus, selective lesion with
6-hydroxydopamine or blockade of postsynaptic receptors
with propranolol [11] or  xxxd2957xxx  [12] markedly prolongs the
behavioural duration of anaesthesia (so-called 'sleeping
time'). the antidepressant desipramine upon chronic administration for periods longer than 8-10 days causes an increase
in sleeping time to  xxxd3354xxx , even when tested in the
absence of drug some 2 or 5 days after the last injection of
desipramine [13]. chronic biochemical and behavioural
events may correlate better with the time course of clinical
improvement in mood than the acute effects such as inhibition of amine uptake (see [10]). similarly, chronic administration of other tricyclic antidepressants and the atypical
ones  xxxd2637xxx , iprindole and viloxazine also elevates
 xxxd3354xxx  sleeping time [14]. as such, the  xxxd3354xxx  anaesthesia model may have some use as a preliminary screen
for novel pharmaceutical agents of possible antidepressant
potential. it was thus of interest to examine the effects of
chronic administration of another type of antidepressant
compound, the  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors.
 xxxg1358xxx  (e.c. 1.4.3.4) is a flavoprotein [26],
associated with outer mitochondrial membranes [4], which
exists in two forms, type a and type b, based on their substrate specificity and sensitivity to inhibitors [6,8]. type a
preferentially deaminates noradrenaline and serotonin, while
type b acts on non-polar amines such as tryptamine.
dopamine is a substrate for both but with possible species
differences [3]. inhibition of  xxxg1358xxx  by the
compounds used here may involve the binding of  xxxd1730xxx ,
 xxxd2850xxx  and deprenyl to the n-5 position of the flavin

method
behavioural
male albino wistar rats (olac, bicester) weighing about
200-400 g were housed in groups of three in a temperature
controlled vivarium on a 12:12 light dark cycle with light
onset  xxxd2274xxx  a.m. f o o d and water were available ad lib. daily
injections via the intraperitoneal route (ip) of drug or saline
were administered between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for 5 or 15
days and then 48 hours after the last drug injection  xxxd3354xxx  sleeping time was determined as previously described
[15]. following an ip injection of 2 ml/kg of 50 mg/kg
 xxxd3354xxx  sodium (may and baker) the first movement
upon awakening was taken as the endpoint of the behavioural determination of anaesthesia duration. ten
animals were used in each group. some groups were retested
at 5 and 8 days after the last drug injection to determine the
recovery timecourse.

results
table 1 shows the effects of daily administration for 5 or
for 15 days of the mixed type a and type b monoamine
oxidase inhibitors phenelzine (10 mg/kg),  xxxd2389xxx  (10
mg/kg), iproniazid (10 mg/kg) and tranylcypromine (5
mg/kg). compared to daily injection of saline a marked prolongation of  xxxd3354xxx  anaesthesia duration occurred in
the 15 day group (t(18)=10.38, 5.21, 4.4 and 7.61, p<0.001
for phenelzine,  xxxd2389xxx , iproniazid and tranylcypromine respectively). table 1 also shows that 5 day administration was without effect when tested 48 hours after the last
drug injection (all t(18) less than 1.3). daily injection of the
type a selective  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors (see table 1
in [25] for references)  xxxd1730xxx  (1 mg/kg) or ly 51641 (1
mg/kg) was also effective in elevating  xxxd3354xxx  sleeping
time after 15 but not 5 days (t(18)=5.35 and 4.06,p<0.001 for
 xxxd1730xxx  and ly 51641 respectively). however, the type b
selective  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors [7,25] deprenyl (0.25
mg/kg) and  xxxd2850xxx  (1 mg/kg) were ineffective even after 15
days (all t(18) less than 1.00).

discussion
the present study showed that chronic treatment with the
mixed type a and b  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors phenelzine, iproniazid,  xxxd2389xxx  and tranylcypromine for 15
days caused a marked prolongation of  xxxd3354xxx  sleeping
time which outlasted the administration of drug for up to 8
further days. similar chronic administration of the selective
type a  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors  xxxd1730xxx  and ly
51461, but not in the doses used here, the type b monoamine
oxidase inhibitors  xxxd2850xxx  and deprenyl, also prolonged
 xxxd3354xxx  anaesthesia duration.
chronic treatment with  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors
may induce changes in brain neurochemistry in addition to
their initial inhibition of  xxxg1358xxx  activity. thus,
tranylcypromine injected for 16 days caused a reduction in
the number of beta-receptors in the rat cortex measured by
in vitro radioligand binding techniques [18] as did  xxxd2717xxx 
and  xxxd1730xxx  [1]. interestingly, this study found that  xxxd2850xxx  at the same dose did not cause such beta downregulation, a result recently confirmed by another group [20]
for  xxxg67xxx  activity. similar failure of monoamine
oxidase type b inhibition to down-regulate cortical betareceptors has been reported for deprenyl [17]. tricyclic
antidepressants seem uniformly to decrease cortical betareceptor number [24] and reduce noradrenaline-stimulated
 xxxg67xxx  activity [22].
 xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors were the first compounds

t h i o p e n t o n e a n a e s t h e s i a in rat
to be used as antidepressants in the clinic since the mood
elevating effect of iproniazid was described in patients receiving the drug for tuberculosis in the early 1950's. double
blind studies have established their efficacy for treatment of
human depression, particularly with phobic anxiety symptoms [21]. although selective type a and type b monoamine
oxidase inhibitors are not in clinical use preliminary studies
suggest that type a inhibitors are effective antidepressants
[5,23] and perhaps more effective than the type b inhibitors
deprenyl or  xxxd2850xxx  [2]. one study found a significant
antidepressant action of deprenyl [9] but a second did not
[161.
it is hence interesting that, in a rat model which responds
to many typical [13] and atypical tricyclic antidepressants
[14], the mixed type  xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors and the
type a selective agents both cause a prolongation of  xxxd3354xxx  sleeping time after chronic administration while the
type b selective drugs do not.
in terms of a quantitative comparison of the effects of
 xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors in this model with those of

203
tricyclic antidepressants [13,14] it may be noted that 15 day
treatment with l0 mg/kg phenelzine, iproniazid or  xxxd2389xxx  elevated sleeping time tested 48 hours after last drug
injection by about 100~ (i.e., from 60 min to around 120
min). similar duration of treatment with l0 mg/kg of the
tricyclics opipramol, doxepin or maprotiline also elevated
sleeping time to 100--120 min (from table 1 in [14]) as did
desipramine [13], while the same dose of amitriptyline or
clomipramine caused prolongation only to about 90 min or
less. the atypical tricyclic viloxazine needed a dose of 30
mg/kg to achieve a 100% increase in sleeping time [14] while
dibenzepin had a similar magnitude of effect at 20 mg/kg.
