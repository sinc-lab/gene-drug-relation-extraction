abstract
the non-benzodiazepine gabaa receptor modulators (‘z-drugs’) – zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone and  xxxd2047xxx  – have become the accepted treatments for insomnia where they are available. however, recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials suggest that, for these drugs, there may be
particular efficacy and tolerability profiles and distinct clinical outcomes in specific patient populations. this is particularly apparent when hypnotic/
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor co-therapy is used to treat patients with co-morbid insomnia and psychiatric disorders, as patient recovery
appears to be accelerated and enhanced by some drugs but not others. emerging evidence of why this should be the case is that these hypnotic drugs
may differ significantly from each other in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. functional selectivity for specific gabaa receptor
subtypes may determine each drug’s clinical attributes, while the pharmacokinetic characteristics of z-drugs also determine to a large extent how they
perform in the clinic. for example, activity at gabaa alpha 1 receptor subtypes may be associated with sedative effects, whereas activity  xxxd2216xxx  2 and
alpha 3 receptor subtypes may be associated with anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. in summary, the distinct clinical outcomes of zaleplon,
zolpidem, zopiclone and  xxxd2047xxx  may be explained by each drug’s unique gabaa receptor subunit selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. further
investigation of gabaa receptor subtype effects would help to increase understanding of current hypnotic drug effects, while knowledge of each drug’s
specific binding profile should enable clinicians to tailor treatment to individual patient’s needs.

introduction
insomnia is a condition of perceived inadequate sleep, with
patients typically presenting with diﬃculty falling asleep, difﬁculty maintaining sleep or poor quality sleep (roth, 2007).
to manage insomnia successfully, pharmacological treatments for insomnia may be required to reduce sleep latency,
increase sleep maintenance and improve sleep quality. in
addition, such treatments should enable normal wakening
with no subsequent impairment of daytime function and
minimal risk of dependence. furthermore, improvements in
next-day functioning and quality of life are also desirable in
hypnotic therapies (waﬀord and ebert, 2008).
as many as 80% of patients with insomnia report comorbid psychiatric symptoms (stewart et al., 2006), and
insomnia is known to be a risk factor for both depression
and anxiety disorders (roth et al., 2006a; janssen-fröjmark
and lindblom, 2008). insomnia in the presence of psychiatric
disorders imposes a signiﬁcant extra burden on patients, who
make greater use of healthcare services than patients with
either of these conditions alone (weissman et al., 1997). it
is thus desirable that hypnotic pharmacotherapies for patients
with co-morbid depression or anxiety provide beneﬁts that
harness optimal eﬃcacy from co-administered antidepressant
or anxiolytic agents (waﬀord and ebert, 2008).
since the late 1980s, four non-benzodiazepine gabaa
receptor modulators (‘z-drugs’) have been developed and

introduced as insomnia therapies: zopiclone, zolpidem immediate release (ir), zaleplon and  xxxd2047xxx .  xxxd2047xxx  is
the pure (s)-enantiomer of racemic zopiclone (najib, 2006),
and was licensed in the usa in december 2004 but it is not
currently available in europe. in the usa in 2005, a
controlled-release version of zolpidem – zolpidem cr – was
launched to give a more prolonged duration of hypnotic
action. these drugs all oﬀer improved tolerability compared
with previous insomnia therapies, the benzodiazepines (kales,
1990; holbrook et al., 2000), and recent studies have provided
evidence for z-drug eﬃcacy over the long-term and across
diﬀerent patient populations.
in this review we examine the functional roles of gabaa
receptors and the gabaa receptor subtype selectivity and
pharmacokinetic (pk) proﬁles of z-drugs, and evaluate how

these attributes may explain recently observed clinical
outcomes.

gabaa receptor subtypes and roles
understanding the diverse physiological roles of gabaa
receptors is fundamental to appreciating the mode of action
and clinical eﬀects of the non-benzodiazepine gabaa receptor modulators. gabaa receptors are complex, highly heterogeneous pentameric clusters of membrane-spanning proteins
found throughout the central nervous system (hevers
and lüddens, 1998). they are involved in gaba-mediated
inhibition and also mediate the sedative, anxiolytic, muscle
relaxant and anticonvulsant eﬀects of drugs such as benzodiazepines and the z-drugs (doble et al., 2004).
elucidation of the gabaa receptor structure has revealed
it is composed of ﬁve protein subunits and at least 19 distinct
subunit isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene, have been
identiﬁed (sieghart, 2006). the most common pentameric
receptor conﬁguration is two alpha subunits, two beta subunits and one  xxxg218xxx  and the most common receptor
subtypes are a1b2g2, a2b3g2 and a3b3g2 (smith and olsen,
1995). gabaa receptor subunit isoforms demonstrate distinct regional and cellular distribution patterns within the
brain (pirker et al., 2000; sieghart, 2006), suggesting that
the location of each gabaa receptor variant as well as its
subunit composition may determine its function.
the alpha 1 subunit is the most common of the gabaa
subunits and is widely distributed throughout most brain
regions, especially throughout the cortex. alpha 2 subunits
are found primarily in the hippocampus, amygdala and basal
ganglia, as well as in the outer layers of the cerebral cortex.
the alpha 3 subtype is expressed in a limited number of brain
regions, such as the reticular thalamic nucleus and inner
layers of the cerebral cortex, and alpha 5 receptors are
found primarily in the limbic system and inner layers of the
cerebral cortex (pirker et al., 2000). the alpha 1, 2, 3 and 5
subunits appear to be the key determinants of hypnotic drug
eﬀects on sleep, mood and cognition (table 1).

sleep regulation
while numerous regions throughout the brain are involved in
arousal, relatively few are involved in promoting sleep. the
ventrolateral preoptic area (vlpo) of the hypothalamus is
one such key region. the vlpo neurons express the neurotransmitters gaba and galanin, which inhibit the arousal
centres in the brain. during sleep, the neurons of the vlpo
actively inhibit the arousal-producing nuclei. in turn, wakefulness results from the arousal-promoting nuclei inhibiting

the vlpo. this mutual inhibitory system can be considered a
‘ﬂip-ﬂop’ switch that eﬀects sharp transitions between states
of consciousness (saper et al., 2005).
the sedative eﬀects of gabaa receptor activation appear
to be mediated by alpha 1-containing receptor subtypes. in
mice it is possible to produce a genetically modiﬁed alpha 1
subunit that is insensitive to benzodiazepines but shows
normal gaba sensitivity (mckernan et al., 2000). studies
in these mice revealed that sedation, amnesic and anticonvulsant eﬀects of benzodiazepines were signiﬁcantly attenuated,
consistent with these eﬀects being mediated primarily through
the alpha 1 subunit (rudolph et al., 1999; crestani et al.,
2000; mckernan et al., 2000). however, the alpha 1 subtype
does not appear to mediate changes on the sleep electroencephalogram (eeg) (tobler et al., 2001), leading to the view
that the alpha 1 subtype is more involved in sedation than in
sleep.
hypnotic eﬀects are also associated with activity at the
alpha 2 subunit (rudolph and möhler, 2004). alpha 2containing gabaa receptors located in the hypothalamus
and cortex are important in the sleep/wake switch mechanism. slow-wave sleep is characterized by low-frequency delta
waves and by high-frequency spindle/sigma waves originating
from the thalamus. thalamic neurons projecting into the
cortex establish slow-wave rhythms in the cortex (harrison,
2007). alpha 2 knock-in mice have demonstrated that the
alpha 2 subunit is responsible for mediating delta eeg activity in non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep and theta
activity in rapid eye movement (rem) sleep (kopp et al.,
2004). of particular importance to sleep is the unique distribution of alpha 3 subtype receptors in the thalamus (pirker
et al., 2000), where they mediate gabaa inhibition in the
reticular nucleus (browne et al., 2001). this area controls
thalamo-cortical oscillations important in regulating sleep.
finally, some evidence suggests alpha 5 receptor agonists
may have sedative eﬀects (van rijnsoever et al., 2004; savić
et al., 2008).

mood regulation
alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunit-containing gabaa receptors
appear to be the subtypes involved in mediating the eﬀects
of gaba on mood. the evidence for this is that the anxiolytic eﬀects of benzodiazepines were not altered in alpha 1
subtype mutant mice (mckernan et al., 2000). mice with
point-mutated alpha 2 gaba receptor subunits lack an
anxiolytic response to diazepam (löw et al., 2000) and
examination of a murine knock-in has shown that the
anxiolytic eﬀect of benzodiazepines is mediated by alpha 2
receptors expressed in the limbic system (kopp et al., 2004).

alpha 3-selective inverse agonism is anxiogenic in mice
(atack et al., 2005), whereas selective alpha 3 agonism is
anxiolytic in mice and primates (dias et al., 2005). the anxiolytic eﬀects of alpha 3-selective gaba receptor agonists may
be mediated by activation of gabaa receptors located on
monoaminergic cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus (gao et al.,
1993; langen and rundfeldt, 2007). in addition, studies of
alpha 3 knockout mice suggest a potential antidepressant role
of this receptor subtype (fiorelli et al., 2008). furthermore
gabaa agonists with selectivity for alpha 2 and alpha 3
subtypes are anxiolytic in rodents and in primates, without
having sedative or adverse cognitive eﬀects (licata et al.,
2005; atack et al., 2006; de haas et al., 2007).

learning and memory
the high levels of expression of alpha 5-containing gabaa
receptors in the hippocampus suggest a potential role for this
subunit in the regulation of learning and memory (lingfordhughes et al., 2002). the development of several alpha 5selective inverse agonists, together with mutant mouse
models, has enabled the role of this receptor to be explored
in some detail and there is substantial evidence supporting the
hypothesis that alpha 5-mediated eﬀects suppress learning
and memory. alpha 5 inverse agonists, which reduce
gaba-mediated neurotransmission through this receptor,
inhibit the amnestic eﬀects of alcohol in humans (nutt
et al., 2007), and enhance cognition, learning and memory
in rodents (collinson et al., 2002; dawson et al., 2006).

gabaa receptor functional selectivity of
z-drugs
emerging evidence indicates that hypnotic gabaa receptor
modulators have diﬀerent binding aﬃnities, potencies and
eﬃcacies at speciﬁc receptor subtypes that may result in speciﬁc functionally discrete pharmacodynamic eﬀects. thus,
examination and consideration of how the binding, potency
and eﬃcacy characteristics work in concert is required to gain
a full understanding of the clinical eﬀects of gabaa receptor
modulators.
the older sedative drugs, the benzodiazepines, show low
aﬃnity and activity  xxxd2216xxx  4 and 6 gabaa receptor subunits but high binding and function  xxxd2216xxx  1, 2, 3 and 5
subtypes when a  xxxg218xxx  (usually gamma 2) is also
present (nutt, 2006). the pattern of low activity  xxxd2216xxx  4
and 6 is also found with the z-drugs, but these show significant diﬀerences in their aﬃnity and activity for the other
alpha subunits.

current  xxxd2216xxx  2 and 3 receptors by 200–400% (figure
1c), this eﬀect may be unlikely in practice due to the relatively
low aﬃnity of zaleplon at these receptor subtypes. therefore,
zaleplon’s clinical eﬀects are probably mediated via the alpha
1 receptor and are predominantly sedative.

zolpidem
zolpidem was designed to be selective for cortical benzodiazepine receptors, which subsequently turned out to be the
alpha 1-containing gabaa receptor subtype. hence, zolpidem was the ﬁrst subtype-selective gabaa receptor agonist.
in fact, zolpidem has the highest aﬃnity at the alpha 1 subtype of all the non-benzodiazepine gabaa receptor modulators, although the other z-drugs bind with only slightly
lower aﬃnity (figure 1a) (sanna et al., 2002; petroski
et al., 2006; brunello et al., 2009). however, zolpidem will
activate alpha 2 and alpha 3 receptors, though at considerably
higher concentrations than those that activate the alpha 1
subtype (figure 1b and c). zolpidem’s aﬃnity for alpha 5
is exceptionally low (negligible in practice), and its eﬃcacy at
this subtype is also minimal (pritchett and seeburg, 1990).
when aﬃnity, potency and eﬃcacy are considered as a
whole, zolpidem’s clinical eﬀects would appear to be mediated
primarily via the alpha 1 receptor subtype (table 2) and thus
zolpidem might not be expected to provide anxiolytic beneﬁts
(mathiasen et al., 2007). a single recent study of zolpidem in
a co2-induced model of generalized anxiety disorder (gad)
in human volunteers demonstrated some anxiolytic eﬃcacy of
zolpidem, although this was less than that seen with a nonselective benzodiazepine (bailey et al., 2009).

zopiclone
zopiclone shows relatively high binding aﬃnity for the alpha
1 over the alpha 3 receptor subtype (table 2 and figure 1a)
(sanna et al., 2002). however, zopiclone also binds to the
alpha 5 receptor with high aﬃnity (brunello et al., 2009).
as zopiclone has similar eﬃcacy  xxxd2216xxx  1, alpha 2, alpha
3 and alpha 5 receptors (petroski et al., 2006; brunello et al.,
2009) (figure 1c), diﬀerences in binding will determine its
eﬀects in vivo. estimation of the functional eﬀect of zopiclone
at clinical doses, based on calculation of likely receptor occupancy, plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic parameters suggests that zopiclone would have its greatest eﬀect
via alpha 1 and alpha 5 receptors (table 3). based on its
binding proﬁle, zopiclone would be expected to provide
anxiolytic beneﬁts only at high dose levels (julou et al.,
1985), with sedative eﬀects and possibly adverse cognitive
eﬀects – via alpha 1 and alpha 5 receptor activation – at
clinical doses.

zaleplon
information on zaleplon’s pharmacodynamic eﬀects is relatively scarce, but it appears that zaleplon binds preferentially
to alpha 1-containing gabaa receptors (noguchi et al.,
2002; king pharmaceuticals, 2006; wegner et al., 2008), and
may be considered alpha 1-selective (sanna et al., 2002;
petroski et al., 2006) (figure 1a and table 2). while studies
indicate that zaleplon is able to potentiate the gabaa

 xxxd2047xxx 
the pharmacodynamic characteristics of  xxxd2047xxx  are just
beginning to be understood (brunello et al., 2009). although
 xxxd2047xxx  is the isolated (s)-enantiomer of zopiclone, this
study revealed notable diﬀerences in the pharmacodynamic
eﬀects of  xxxd2047xxx  compared with racemic (r,s)-zopiclone.

functional effect was calculated as follows: the estimated peak free concentration
of  xxxd2047xxx  and zopiclone in the brain at cmax is 90 nm. the effect of this concentration on gabaa chloride flux in receptors composed of the different subunits
was estimated from dose–effect curves in transfected oocytes.
as shown, the effect of  xxxd2047xxx  at the alpha 2 and alpha 3 subtypes was roughly
a 100% increase in the action of gaba at its ec10 value, whereas for zopiclone it was
much less. the effects  xxxd2216xxx  1 and alpha 5 subtypes were proportionately lower
for  xxxd2047xxx  but higher for zopiclone.

alpha 3 and alpha 5 subtypes is similar (although not identical) to that of zopiclone, but the binding aﬃnities of  xxxd2047xxx  are all higher than those seen with zopiclone (figure
1a). this is consistent with the (s)-enantiomer in the racemic
mixture being solely responsible for zopiclone binding to
alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 gabaa receptor subtypes,
but not so for alpha 5 receptors.  xxxd2047xxx  has a very
high aﬃnity for alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 5 gabaa receptors; its binding aﬃnity for alpha 1 is similar to that of zolpidem (figure 1a). although  xxxd2047xxx  has a relatively lower
aﬃnity for alpha 3 it still binds to this receptor subtype with
greater aﬃnity than either zolpidem or zopiclone.
 xxxd2047xxx ’s potency is greatest  xxxd2216xxx  5 receptors, followed by alpha 2 and alpha 3 receptors (table 2) but it is still

a very potent drug at the alpha 1 receptor subtype (figure 1b)
with an ec50 of the same order of magnitude as zaleplon and
zopiclone.  xxxd2047xxx  is particularly eﬃcacious  xxxd2216xxx  2
and 3 receptors, with the highest eﬃcacy of the nonbenzodiazepine gabaa modulators when examined in the
same study (brunello et al., 2009), but is much less eﬃcacious
 xxxd2216xxx  5 receptors. the diﬀerences in potency and eﬃcacy
between  xxxd2047xxx  and racemic zopiclone suggest that, in
the racemic mixture, the (r)-enantiomer may allosterically
interact with the gabaa receptor to aﬀect the activity of
the (s)-enantiomer. in support of this, it has been shown
that (r)-zopiclone blocks the biological activity of  xxxd2047xxx  in a rodent model of anxiety (data on ﬁle, sepracor
document 190–409).
when aﬃnity, potency and eﬃcacy are all taken into
account,  xxxd2047xxx  appears to act predominantly through
alpha 2 and alpha 3 receptors with some eﬀect via alpha 1
receptors (table 3). a compound with similar high alpha 1
aﬃnity, but functional selectivity for alpha 2 and 3, has
shown anxiolytic eﬀects (wang et al., 2008) and, based on
its binding and activity proﬁle,  xxxd2047xxx  would be expected
to provide both hypnotic and anxiolytic beneﬁts at similar
dose levels.

pharmacokinetic profiles of z-drugs
the pk proﬁle may be more critical for a hypnotic drug in the
treatment of insomnia than for any other drug in psychiatry
(szuba et al., 2003; drover, 2004). an optimal pk proﬁle
would enable a hypnotic agent to be eﬀective in all key symptom domains (table 4). for example, a rapid absorption rate
(usually predicted by a short time to maximum plasma concentration [tmax]) will result in a short time to maximum
brain receptor occupancy and beneﬁt patients with initial
sleep latency diﬃculties (figure 2a), while sustained high
brain receptor occupancy (suﬃciently long half-life [t½]) is
required to help patients with sleep maintenance problems.
however, a t½ that is too prolonged may increase the risk of
drug accumulation with repeated doses and produce hangover eﬀects, so clearance from receptors must be fast
enough to allow normal wakening and to prevent interference
with next-day function (figure 2b). consequently, the individual pk characteristics of the non-benzodiazepine gabaa
receptor modulators (table 5) and any active metabolites
determine to a large extent how they perform in the clinic.
zaleplon has a short tmax and the shortest t½ of the current
z-drugs (table 5), explaining its fast onset and the fastest oﬀset
of action. zolpidem ir has a longer t½ than zaleplon, resulting
in a longer duration of action. zolpidem cr consists of a twolayer tablet: the outer layer dissolves quickly, while the second
layer dissolves slowly to maintain plasma zolpidem concentrations above those seen for the ir formulation, particularly at
three to six hours post-dose (weinling et al., 2006).
zopiclone is a racemic mixture of (s)- and (r)-isomers,
with stereoselective pk proﬁles (fernandez et al., 1993,
2002) and clinical outcomes (mcmahon et al., 2003).
racemic zopiclone has the longest tmax of the z-drugs and
plasma concentrations of the more active enantiomer, (s)zopiclone, remain below the sleep-inducing threshold (of
10 ng/ml) for more than half an hour after administration

(brunello et al., 2008) (figure 3). racemic zopiclone has a
longer t½ than either zaleplon or zolpidem, suggesting a
longer duration of action. however, this means that (s)-zopiclone plasma concentrations may not fall below the sleepinducing threshold until more than 9 hours after racemic
zopiclone dosing (figure 3b). an additional consideration is
the duration of eﬀects of zopiclone’s active metabolite,
(s)-desmethylzopiclone (sdmz), and the less active enantiomer, (r)-zopiclone. measurable plasma concentrations of
both sdmz and (r)-zopiclone are present 8 hours after zopiclone dosing and could contribute to unwanted next-day
residual eﬀects (carlson et al., 2001).
 xxxd2047xxx  appears to have improved pks compared
with the racemic mixture (figure 3), presumably due to the
absence of confounding eﬀects of (r)-zopiclone (fernandez
et al., 1993). plasma concentrations of the active enantiomer,
(s)-zopiclone, reach the threshold for inducing sleep well
within 30 minutes of dosing with  xxxd2047xxx  (figure 3a).
coupled with this rapid onset of action, (s)-zopiclone concentrations fall below the estimated sleep-inducing threshold
at approximately 8 hours post-dose (figure 3b), reducing the
risk of residual next-day eﬀects. levels of sdmz are detectable at this time but are lower than those seen after an equivalently eﬀective dose of racemic zopiclone (brunello et al.,
2008), suggesting that use of the single-isomer drug may
reduce the risk of residual eﬀects compared with the parent
compound.

several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
have examined the eﬃcacy and safety of z-drugs in patients
with chronic primary insomnia (table 6) and provided the
basis for the approval of these agents. however, once marketed, hypnotic agents are often used oﬀ-label and longterm in patients who may have co-morbid disorders. in
2005, the nih consensus panel on insomnia called for
more long-term data in patients with chronic insomnia;
the completion of larger and longer trials provided valuable
data on the long-term eﬃcacy and safety of z-drugs.
examination of treatment eﬀects in other populations have
also been called for (waﬀord and ebert, 2008), and several
clinical trials in patients with co-morbid insomnia and major
depressive disorder (mdd) or gad have investigated the
eﬀects of co-therapy with z-drugs and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (ssris) on measures of sleep, anxiety
and depression.

zaleplon improves sleep latency but not sleep duration
(elie et al., 1999) (table 6), and so is an appropriate choice
for patients whose primary complaint is diﬃculty falling
asleep but not for patients with sleep maintenance diﬃculties
(drover, 2004). however, the short t½ explains zaleplon’s
lack of residual eﬀects (fry et al., 2000; walsh et al., 2000a;
stone et al., 2002), and means that zaleplon is the only
hypnotic indicated for taking after the patient has gone to
bed and has experienced diﬃculty falling asleep (walsh
et al., 2000a). no tolerance, rebound insomnia or withdrawal

symptoms have been seen after treatment discontinuation
in pivotal trials (elie et al., 1999; fry et al., 2000; stone
et al., 2002). as yet, clinical data are not available to evaluate
zaleplon’s eﬀects on mood.

zolpidem
zolpidem ir improves sleep latency and has shown inconsistent eﬀects on sleep maintenance (scharf et al., 1994; monti
et al., 1996; walsh et al., 2000b; perlis et al., 2004) (table 6).
zolpidem cr is a more rational choice for improving sleep
duration (weinling et al., 2006; krystal et al., 2008a; walsh
et al., 2008) but is not currently available in europe.
zolpidem ir treatment is associated with signiﬁcant reductions in rem sleep (scharf et al., 1994) and tolerance and
rebound insomnia have been reported (monti et al., 1994;
ware et al., 1997; roth et al., 2006b). however, zolpidem
ir and cr use does not appear to be associated with nextday residual impairments compared with placebo (dockhorn
and dockhorn, 1996; krystal et al., 2008a) and zolpidem ir

has been associated with improvements in next-day function
(scharf et al., 1994).
zolpidem/ssri co-therapy in patients with depression and
persistent insomnia, and patients with co-morbid insomnia
and mdd, is associated with signiﬁcant sleep beneﬁts compared with ssri monotherapy. in contrast, zolpidem/ssri
co-therapy is not associated with any additional antidepressant beneﬁts over ssri monotherapy as measured by the
ham-d17 scale (asnis et al., 1999; fava et al., 2008). in a
study of patients with insomnia co-morbid with gad, zolpidem cr/escitalopram co-therapy resulted in signiﬁcant sleep
improvements compared with monotherapy. initial anxiolytic
beneﬁts, as measured by the ham-a scale, were seen with
zolpidem cr/escitalopram co-therapy versus monotherapy
at week 1, but there were no between-group diﬀerences in
ham-a outcomes beyond this point (fava et al., 2007)
which suggest the eﬀects on anxiety scores were probably
due to beneﬁts on sleep items. taken together, these results
suggest that zolpidem does not augment mood changes when
co-administered with an ssri.

(2008b); 16fava et al. (2006); 17pollack et al. (2008).

zopiclone
racemic zopiclone reduces sleep latency and increases total
sleep time (tst) (ngen and hassan, 1990; ponciano et al.,
1990; noble et al., 1998; sivertsen et al., 2006) (table 6).
however, when compared head-to-head with zolpidem ir
(tsutsui et al., 2001), signiﬁcantly fewer zopiclone-treated
patients (77.5% versus 85.8%) showed a clinical improvement
in sleep latency while similar proportions of each group were
rated by investigators as at least ‘‘moderately improved’’
(tsutsui et al., 2001). zopiclone has also been associated
with impaired next-day functioning (vermeeren et al., 2002;
staner et al., 2005). racemic zopiclone’s utility may be limited by its potential for residual next-day eﬀects and known
associations with impaired driving ability (bocca and denise,
2000; isawa et al., 2000; vermeeren et al., 2002; staner et al.,
2005).

 xxxd2047xxx 
 xxxd2047xxx  signiﬁcantly improves objective measures of sleep
versus placebo (zammit et al., 2004; scharf et al., 2005;
mccall et al., 2006) (table 6). there is no evidence that

 xxxd2047xxx  therapy is associated with any changes in sleep
architecture (zammit et al., 2004). in contrast to ﬁndings
reported for racemic zopiclone,  xxxd2047xxx  provides beneﬁts
in next-day functioning and alertness (krystal et al., 2003;
rosenberg et al., 2005; roth et al., 2005; scharf, 2006).
furthermore,  xxxd2047xxx  does not appear to aﬀect next-day
driving skills (boyle et al., 2008).  xxxd2047xxx ’s sleep and
next-day function improvements are sustained over 6–12
months (krystal et al., 2003; roth et al., 2005; walsh et al.,
2007) and there is no signiﬁcant evidence of tolerance, dependence or rebound insomnia during and after long-term
treatment (zammit et al., 2004; roth et al., 2005).
 xxxd2047xxx -associated improvements in patient-reported
sleep and daytime function outcomes are also seen in elderly
patients with primary insomnia (krystal et al., 2008b,c); these
beneﬁts occur rapidly and are sustained for 3 months, with no
rebound

in studies of  xxxd2047xxx /ssri co-therapy in patients with
insomnia co-morbid with mdd or gad, (fava et al., 2006;
pollack et al., 2008), patients receiving  xxxd2047xxx /ssri
co-therapy reported early and sustained signiﬁcant sleep beneﬁts compared with patients receiving ssri monotherapy.

notably, and in contrast to the outcomes reported for zolpidem,  xxxd2047xxx /ﬂuoxetine co-therapy signiﬁcantly improved
the magnitude of ﬂuoxetine’s antidepressant eﬀects from
week 1 onwards (fava et al., 2006) even when insomniarelated items were excluded from the ham-d scale.
furthermore, the sleep and mood beneﬁts observed in the
 xxxd2047xxx /ﬂuoxetine co-therapy group versus the monotherapy group persisted after discontinuation of  xxxd2047xxx 
(krystal et al., 2007). to date,  xxxd2047xxx  is the only
z-drug reported to provide additional antidepressant beneﬁts
in patients with mdd and insomnia, when co-administered
with a ssri. in the separate gad study, the  xxxd2047xxx /
escitalopram combination signiﬁcantly improved the onset
and duration of escitalopram’s anxiolytic eﬀects;  xxxd2047xxx 
co-therapy was associated with signiﬁcant improvements in
ham-d17 and ham-a scores compared with monotherapy
at weeks 1 and 8, even after removal of insomnia items from
the scales (pollack et al., 2008). these data extend the ﬁndings
from the mdd studies, and suggest  xxxd2047xxx  may also
provide additional anxiolytic beneﬁts to patients with gad
receiving ssri treatment. as discussed above, these moodenhancing eﬀects of  xxxd2047xxx  are likely to stem from its
pharmacological eﬀects  xxxd2216xxx  2 and 3 gabaa receptors.

summary
recent improvements in our knowledge of gabaa receptor
pharmacology have led to the development of more selective
insomnia treatments. drugs with activity at gabaa receptors containing the alpha 1 subunit are eﬀective sedative
agents. those with activity at gabaa receptors containing
alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits, such as  xxxd2047xxx , may
enhance physiological sleep and also have the potential to
be particularly eﬃcacious in patients with co-morbid insomnia and mood disorders. pharmacokinetic parameters can differentiate hypnotic treatment eﬀects, and agents with a rapid
onset of action (short tmax) and a relatively short t1/2 are
likely to provide an optimal balance of sleep onset and maintenance beneﬁts without next-day residual eﬀects. these
developments in hypnotic drug therapies should help clinicians to manage insomnia more eﬀectively by selecting treatment based upon an individual’s symptoms.
