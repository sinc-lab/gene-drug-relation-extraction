abstract
a growing body of evidence suggests that chronic kidney
disease is a significant risk for cardiovascular events and
stroke regardless of traditional risk factors. the aim of this
study was to examine the effects of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor ( xxxg1805xxx ) agonists on the tissue damage
affecting salt-loaded spontaneously hypertensive strokeprone rats (shrsps), an animal model that develops a complex pathology characterized by systemic inflammation, hypertension, and proteinuria and leads to end-organ injury
(initially renal and subsequently cerebral). compared with the
 xxxg1805xxx ␥ agonist rosiglitazone, the  xxxg1805xxx ␣ ligands  xxxd2096xxx 
and  xxxd1724xxx  significantly increased survival (p ⬍ 0.001) by
delaying the occurrence of brain lesions monitored by magnetic
resonance imaging (p ⬍ 0.001) and delaying increased proteinuria (p ⬍ 0.001).  xxxd2096xxx  completely prevented the renal

introduction
high blood pressure and kidney disease have been associated with an increased incidence of stroke. epidemiological
studies report a high stroke risk in subjects with kidney
disease even after adjusting for traditional risk factors
(townsend, 2008), suggesting that the pathophysiology of
cerebrovascular diseases and renal dysfunction involve difthis work was supported by fondo per gli investimenti della ricerca di base

disorder characterized by severe vascular lesions, tubular damage, and glomerular sclerosis, reduced the number of ed-1positive cells and collagen accumulation, and decreased the
renal expression of interleukin-1␤, transforming growth factor
␤, and  xxxg357xxx . it also prevented
the plasma and urine accumulation of acute-phase and oxidized proteins, suggesting that the protection induced by
 xxxg1805xxx ␣ agonists was at least partially caused by their antiinflammatory and antioxidative properties. the results of this
study demonstrate that  xxxg1805xxx  agonism has beneficial effects
on spontaneous brain and renal damage in shrsps by inhibiting systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, and they support carrying out future studies aimed at evaluating the effect of
 xxxg1805xxx ␣ agonists on proteinuria and clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients with renal disease at increased risk of stroke.

ferent phenomena arising from a common vascular origin (ito
et al., 2009).
albuminuria and, even more, microalbuminuria may
therefore be early signs of vascular damage, reflecting a
generalized endothelial dysfunction that occurs in the kidney
and cerebral vessels. emerging data indicate that antiproteinuric pharmacological agents may not only assure a better
renal prognosis, but also better cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes (park et al., 2003).

materials and methods
animals and treatments. male shrsps aged 4 to 5 weeks were
obtained from charles river italia (calco, italy). the procedures
involving the animals and their care were carried out at the university of milan’s department of pharmacological sciences in accordance with the institution’s guidelines, which comply with italian
and international rules and policies. baseline measurements were
made in all of the rats when they were 6 weeks old, and all of the
animals were then switched (day 0) to a specific permissive diet that
was low in potassium and protein and high in sodium (japanese
permissive diet; laboratorio dr. piccioni, gessate, italy; 18.7% protein, 0.63% potassium, 0.37% sodium) accompanied by 1% nacl in
drinking water. at the same time, they were randomly divided into
the following groups for oral gavage treatment: group 1 (n ⫽ 14)
received 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose (vehicle); group 2 (n ⫽
14) received 150 mg/kg/day  xxxd2096xxx ; and group 3 (n ⫽ 6) received
30 mg/kg/day rosiglitazone. two other groups received  xxxd1724xxx 
dissolved in corn oil (300 mg/kg/day: n ⫽ 6) or the vehicle alone (n ⫽
6), and one group continued a standard diet (normal diet group: n ⫽
4), the experimental situation in which shrsps do not develop any
histological or biochemical alterations.
to allow the amount of the administered drugs to be adjusted to
changes in body weight, drug concentrations were recalculated
weekly.  xxxd2096xxx  and  xxxd1724xxx  were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo), and rosiglitazone was from enzo life sciences,
inc. (plymouth meeting, pa). the drug doses were chosen on the
basis of previous rat studies (jiang et al., 2004; morgan et al., 2006).
once a week, all of the rats were weighed and then housed individually in metabolic cages for 24 h to measure their food and liquid
intake, and their urine was collected. systolic arterial blood pressure
was measured weekly in conscious rats by means of tail-cuff plethysmography (pb recorder 8006; ugo basile, comerio, italy). during
each recording session, blood pressure was measured three times in
each animal by at least two expert operators, who were blinded to the

experimental groups. twenty-four-hour urinary proteins were measured according to bradford, 1976 , with bovine albumin being used
as a standard. proteinuria (protein levels of ⱖ40 mg/day) predicts
the appearance of brain abnormalities in shrsps (blezer et al.,
1998; guerrini et al., 2002) and was used to schedule the frequency
of magnetic resonance imaging (mri) every week until 24-h proteinuria exceeded 40 mg/day, and then every other day until brain
damage was observed.
after 6 weeks of dietary treatment, and after collecting blood and
24-h urine samples, four animals from group 1 (vehicle-treated),
group 2 ( xxxd2096xxx  150 mg/kg/day), and the normal diet group were
randomly euthanized, and their brains and kidneys were harvested
for immunohistochemical and molecular biology analyses. in the
remaining animals, the treatments were continued for up to 98 days.
the behavior of all of the considered parameters (i.e., the development of proteinuria, body weight changes, the time to the development of brain abnormalities, and the biochemical parameters) was
identical in the rats receiving 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose
or corn oil (the vehicles, respectively, used for  xxxd2096xxx /rosiglitazone or  xxxd1724xxx ), and so they will hereafter be considered a single
group (also for the purposes of comparing measurements) and referred to as the “vehicle” group.
mri evaluation of brain damage. the rats were anesthetized
with 2% isofluorane in 70% n2/30% o2 and placed inside a bruker
avance ii 4.7t spectrometer (bruker biospin, ettlinger, germany)
with a micro-imaging accessory. after a sagittal scout image, 16
contiguous 1-mm-thick slices were analyzed caudally to the olfactory
bulb by using a field of view of 4 ⫻ 3 cm2. a turbo spin echo
t2-weighted sequence was used with 16 echoes per excitation and a
10-ms interecho time, 80-ms equivalent echo time, and 3-s repetition
time. the images consisted of 128 ⫻ 96 points and had a spatial
resolution of 0.312 mm/pixel. sixteen images were averaged over 3
min, 30 s. the occurrence of lesions was identified as the presence of
areas of high signal intensity in the t2-weighted images.
urine analysis by means of one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. one-dimensional electrophoresis (1-de) analyses of the
weekly urine samples were run in the presence of sds without
sample reduction in a discontinuous buffer system on polyacrylamide gradients of 4 to 12% t; the sample load was 50 ␮g of urine
proteins.
the gels were stained with colloidal blue before densitometric
acquisition (gs800; bio-rad laboratories, milan, italy). in brief, the
gels were fixed with a fixing solution containing 40% methanol and
10% acetic acid and stained overnight with a solution containing
0.12% coomassie brilliant blue  xxxg250xxx , 8% (nh4)2so4, 1.6% phosphoric acid, and 20% methanol. they were then destained by using a
solution containing 25% methanol. densitometry was performed by
using quantity one version 4.5.2 (bio-rad laboratories) after background subtraction by evaluating the percentages of low molecular
weight and high molecular weight protein density in relation to total
protein density.
analysis of mrna for  xxxg357xxx , tgf-␤1, and il-1␤. total rna
was prepared by guanidium thiocyanate denaturation from the frozen kidneys collected from the vehicle- and  xxxd2096xxx  (150 mg/kg/
day)-treated rats sacrificed after 6 weeks of dietary treatment (n ⫽ 4
in each group) and from four animals in the normal diet group fed a
standard diet during the same time period. the expression of  xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ), transforming growth factor-␤1 (tgf-␤1), and interleukin-1␤ (il-1␤) was measured by semiquantitative rt-pcr (sironi et al., 2004), with  xxxg861xxx  being
amplified as a standard. the rt-pcr products were separated on
1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. the
intensity of each band was quantified by using national institutes of
health (bethesda, md) image software and expressed in arbitrary
units (a.u.). the densities of the  xxxg357xxx , tgf-␤1, and il-1␤ bands
were normalized by using the corresponding  xxxg861xxx  signal.

teinuria, histological lesions in the renal vasculature and
parenchyma, and endothelial dysfunction contributing to the
onset of brain injury (blezer et al., 1998; sironi et al., 2005),
in which we have shown that renoprotective compounds also
delay the appearance of brain damage (sironi et al., 2004;
gianella et al., 2007; gelosa et al., 2009).
in this context, one successful strategy for inducing neuroprotection in stroke could be to modulate multiple pathophysiological pathways simultaneously by using a combination of drugs or, even better, one pharmacological agent with
pleiotropic effects. there is some evidence that drugs acting
on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars), a
family of nuclear transcriptional factor receptors, can induce
such pleiotropic effects as they simultaneously regulate several genes. the three isoforms/subtypes of ppars (␣, ␤/␦, and
␥) are involved in a number of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipoproteins, lipid metabolism, and
glucose homeostasis.
in addition to their well known lipid-lowering activity,
 xxxg1805xxx ␣ activators have pleiotropic properties that lead to
anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in vivo (besson
et al., 2005). emerging data suggest that  xxxg1805xxx ␥ also downregulates inflammatory processes at both peripheral and cerebral levels (delerive et al., 2001; bordet et al., 2006).
these findings prompted us to examine the effect of  xxxg1805xxx 
ligands in shrsps, an animal model of a complex pathology
that is characterized by systemic inflammation, hypertension, and proteinuria and leads to end-organ damage at renal
and, subsequently, cerebral levels.

results
physiological variables. the salt-loaded shrsps
treated with vehicle showed a progressive increase in 24-h
proteinuria, which rose sharply after 4 to 5 weeks of permissive diet and reached 300 mg/day after 7 weeks (fig. 1a).
chronic treatment with rosiglitazone (30 mg/kg/day) had no
effect, whereas  xxxd2096xxx  (150 mg/kg/day) and  xxxd1724xxx 
(300 mg/kg/day) completely prevented any increase in proteinuria (fig. 1a).
the shrsps exposed to salt loading developed severe hypertension, which was not affected by any of the drugs used
in the study (data not shown). body weight increased similarly in all groups, but decreased 2 weeks before the appearance of brain abnormalities in the vehicle- and rosiglitazonetreated rats (fig. 1b).
appearance of brain damage and survival. the vehicle-treated shrsps developed brain abnormalities detected by mri during 7 weeks of the permissive diet (fig. 1c).
treatment with rosiglitazone failed to delay the occurrence of
brain damage, whereas the animals treated with  xxxd1724xxx  or
 xxxd2096xxx  remained free of mri-detectable lesions for 14
weeks of dietary treatment, after which the animals were
euthanized (fig. 1c).
the difference in survival between the groups treated
with vehicle or rosiglitazone and those treated with  xxxd2096xxx  or  xxxd1724xxx  was statistically significant (fig. 1d):
the vehicle- and rosiglitazone-treated rats died, respectively, 43 ⫾ 8 and 50 ⫾ 2 days after the start of dietary
treatment, whereas  xxxd1724xxx  and  xxxd2096xxx  reduced
mortality to zero throughout the 14 weeks of observation
(fig. 1d).
urinary accumulation of inflammatory proteins. at
the beginning of the experiment (week 1; fig. 2a), one of the
most abundantly excreted proteins in 24-h urine was the
major urinary protein (or ␣-2-globulin, the main protein excreted in the urine of healthy male rats) together with other
low molecular weight proteins that accounted for approximately 70% of total protein content. the protein composition
of urine changed over time in the vehicle-treated shrsps
(n ⫽ 4); in particular, high molecular weight proteins (previously identified as markers of inflammation) (sironi et al.,
2001) started accumulating within 5 weeks of treatment at
the same time as the percentage of low molecular weight
proteins decreased (fig. 2, a and b). the representative 1-de
image of the urine samples collected from a rat treated with
 xxxd2096xxx  at 150 mg/kg/day (fig. 2c) and the densitometric
analysis of the excreted proteins in the  xxxd2096xxx -treated
rats (fig. 2d) show that high molecular weight proteins did
not increase to more than 50% of total protein content even
after 14 weeks of treatment.
effects of  xxxd2096xxx  on renal disorder. the kidneys
taken from the vehicle-treated rats after 6 weeks of dietary
treatment showed severe vascular lesions, tubular damage,
and glomerular sclerosis (fig. 3a), massive ed-1-positive
inflammatory cell infiltration (fig. 3b), and a massive accumulation of collagen (data not shown).  xxxd2096xxx  at 150
mg/kg/day completely prevented the development of renal
lesions and abolished the tissue infiltration of ed-1-positive
cells (fig. 3, a and b) and collagen accumulation.
moreover, in comparison with the animals fed a normal
diet, the vehicle-treated rats fed a permissive diet showed a

and four treated with  xxxd2096xxx  (150 mg/kg/day) were euthanized.
after being fixed in carnoy reagent (merck, darmstadt, germany)
and embedded in paraplast (sigma-aldrich), renal sections of 5 ␮m
were cut and used for hematoxylin/eosin staining and immunohistochemical studies as described previously (gianella et al., 2007; gelosa et al., 2009). the presence of inflammatory infiltrates was visualized by using an anti-ed-1 primary antibody (1:100; serotec, oxford,
uk), and the presence of collagen was visualized by staining with sirius
red f3ba (0.5% in saturated aqueous picric acid) (sigma-aldrich).
advanced oxidation protein product assay. the determination of urinary aopp after 6 weeks of dietary treatment was based
on spectrophotometric detection according to witko-sarsat et al.
(1996); 200 ␮l of plasma diluted 1:5 in phosphate-buffered saline was
placed in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and, immediately
after the addition of 10 ␮l of 1.16 m  xxxd2375xxx  and 20 ␮l of
acetic acid, absorbance was measured at 340 nm with a mithras
lp940 fluorescence spectrometer (berthold technologies italia, milan, italy).
quantification of protein carbonyl groups. protein carbonyls were measured in the plasma samples and brain homogenates of
animals sacrificed after 6 weeks of dietary treatment (banfi et al.,
2008) by using a zentech pc test elisa in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions (biocell, papatoetoe, auckland, new
zealand). the plasma was collected in a citrate solution (0.129 m)
and prepared by centrifugation at 1500g for 10 min at 4°c. the
tissues were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm tris, 10 mm edta, 1 mm
egta, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm  xxxd302xxx , 2 ␮g/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium
orthovanadate; all from sigma-aldrich), and the samples were
briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 18,000g for 5 min at 4°c. in
brief, the plasma samples and brain homogenates were reacted with
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (dnph) before probing with an antibody
against protein-conjugated dnph, and the absorbances were read
by using a 450-nm filter on a mithras lp940 fluorescence spectrometer (berthold technologies italia). the standard curve of oxidized
albumin and the samples were assayed in triplicate; the intraassay and
interassay coefficients of variation were less than 2.1 and 3.2%,
respectively.
western blotting of carbonylated proteins. protein carbonyl
immunoblotting was carried out on cerebral cortex, and urine was
collected after 6 weeks of treatment from non–salt-loaded rats (normal diet group; n ⫽ 4), vehicle-treated salt-loaded rats (n ⫽ 4), and
 xxxd2096xxx  (150 mg/kg/day)-treated salt-loaded rats (n ⫽ 4). the
brain homogenate supernatant (50 ␮g) and urine proteins (50 ␮g)
were then dissolved in 24 ␮l of 6% sds and mixed with 8 ␮l of 20 mm
dnph in 20% trifluoroacetic acid. derivatization was allowed for 15
to 30 min at room temperature, after which 32 ␮l of sample buffer (2
m  xxxd3449xxx  containing 30% glycerol and 1 m ␤- xxxd26xxx )
was added. the proteins were then separated on 12% sds polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (banfi et al.,
2003), which were incubated with primary biotinylated antibodies
directed against dnp adducts (1:5000; promega, milan, italy). the
blots were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (1:1000, bio-rad laboratories), and the bands were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl system; ge
healthcare, little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk). the densitometric analysis were performed with quantity one version 4.5.2
(bio-rad laboratories).
statistical analysis. between-group differences were computed by
analysis of variance followed by an appropriate post hoc test; the between-group differences in proteinuria and low molecular weight and
high molecular weight protein density were computed by analysis of
variance for repeated measurements over time followed by tukey’s post
hoc test. an unpaired t test was used to compare the normal diet and
vehicle-treated group data. the results are expressed as mean values ⫾
s.d.; p ⬍ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

discussion

neuroprotective effect is associated with a decrease in cerebral oxidative stress, which may depend on the increased
activity of numerous antioxidant enzymes such as cu/zn
superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (deplanque et al., 2003). this modulation of antioxidant enzymes is responsible for a decrease in the ischemia-induced
production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation
(collino et al., 2006). moreover,  xxxd2096xxx  decreases susceptibility to stroke in  xxxg177xxx -deficient mice partly by
inhibiting chronically high oxidative stress levels in their
brains by reducing the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive
substances, an index of lipid peroxidation (deplanque et al.,
2003).
we now add evidence that  xxxd2096xxx  reduces systemic
protein oxidation in both plasma and urine. protein carbonyls are considered a marker of oxidative stress and
used to quantify the degree of oxidative damage in
polypeptide chains (dalle-donne et al., 2003). this parameter may have some advantages over the analysis of lipid
peroxidation products, because the formation of proteinbound carbonyl groups seems to be commonly associated
with protein oxidation, and oxidized proteins are formed
relatively early and relative stably. it is also known that
cells degrade oxidized proteins over hours or days, whereas
lipid peroxidation products are detoxified within minutes
(siems et al., 1997). it is noteworthy that protein carbonyl
groups are formed early and circulate in the blood for
longer than the other parameters of oxidative stress (pantke et al., 1999). in addition, their chemical stability
makes them suitable for laboratory measurement (griffiths, 2000). the detection of high levels of protein carbonyls is a sign of oxidative stress and protein dysfunction
(dalle-donne et al., 2003; banfi et al., 2008), but we cannot
exclude the possibility that other types of oxidative modification occur in salt-loaded and vehicle-treated shrsps.
the relationships between protein oxidation, protein
dysfunction, and diseases remain largely undefined, but it
is known that oxidative changes in enzymes and structural
proteins play a significant role in the pathophysiology of
diseases such as stroke (lakhan et al., 2009) and alzheimer’s disease (butterfield et al., 1997). the finding that
high levels of oxidized proteins in the plasma and urine of
vehicle-treated shrsps correlates with the development
of proteinuria supports the hypothesis that, together with
inflammation, reactive oxygen species are considerably involved in the progression of renal diseases.
it is noteworthy that there is growing evidence that
chronic kidney disease is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events and stroke regardless of traditional
risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes (khella and bleicher, 2007). in addition to its antioxidative effects and brain protection, we found that  xxxd2096xxx  delayed the onset of proteinuria and prevented
morphological renal alterations. this finding is relevant
because it corroborates the results of the field study of
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (keech et al., 2005),
which showed that  xxxd2096xxx  treatment had an important
protective effect on the secondary outcome of total cardiovascular disease events such as stroke, the progression of
albuminuria, and microvasculature damage, thus confirming the results of the diabetes atherosclerosis intervention study (ansquer et al., 2005).

the main finding of this study is that  xxxd2096xxx  and
 xxxd1724xxx , two activators of  xxxg1805xxx ␣, provided end-organ protection in shrsp rats, a well established model of spontaneous hypertension and systemic inflammation, whereas rosiglitazone, a  xxxg1805xxx ␥ activator, failed to exert any beneficial
effect. in particular,  xxxd2096xxx  prevented the body fluid
accumulation of acute-phase and carbonylated proteins, suggesting that the protection induced by the  xxxg1805xxx ␣ agonists
was at least partially caused by their anti-inflammatory and
antioxidative properties.
previous in vivo studies have shown that treatment with
 xxxg1805xxx ␣ agonists has neuroprotective effects in models of focal
ischemia (deplanque et al., 2003; collino et al., 2006), and
observations that these effects are absent in  xxxg1805xxx ␣- deficient mice (zhao et al., 2009) reinforce the hypothesis that
they are receptor dependent. furthermore,  xxxd2096xxx  treatment decreases the neurological deficit induced by traumatic
brain injury caused by lateral fluid percussion in rats (besson et al., 2005), and it has been shown that 14 days of
preventive treatment with  xxxd2096xxx  reduces susceptibility
to stroke in  xxxg177xxx -deficient mice and decreases
cerebral infarct volume in wild-type mice (deplanque et al.,
2003). another study has shown that two different  xxxg1805xxx ␣
agonists [ xxxd2096xxx  and [[4-chloro-6-[(2,3-dimethylphenyl)amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]thio]-acetic acid (wy-14643)] provide similar brain protection when administered respectively
3 and 7 days before the induction of cerebral ischemia (inoue
et al., 2003). it has been demonstrated that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ agonists
can also exert an acute neuroprotective effect when administered just before cerebral ischemia or during the reperfusion period (ouk et al., 2005; collino et al., 2006).
it is noteworthy that we found that the  xxxg1805xxx ␥ agonist
rosiglitazone failed to protect the brain against the damage
that spontaneously develops in shrsp rats. this finding is
in contrast with the growing body of evidence suggesting that
 xxxg1805xxx ␥ is a regulator of cell inflammatory and ischemic responses. it has been found that the administration of the
 xxxg1805xxx ␥ agonists troglitazone or pioglitazone (24 or 72 h before and at the time of cerebral infarction) dramatically reduces infarct volume and improves neurological function after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats by
negatively regulating the expression of proinflammatory
genes (sundararajan et al., 2005). however, the fact that
pioglitazone reduces infarct size in the case of transient but
not permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion suggests
that the neuroprotective role of  xxxg1805xxx ␥ is specific to events
occurring during reperfusion. it has also been demonstrated
that rosiglitazone reduces inflammation but does not provide
neuroprotection or have any beneficial effect on brain edema
after surgical brain injury (hyong et al., 2008). these data
seem to suggest that rosiglitazone does not specifically target
edema, particularly the vasogenic edema occurring in our
experimental model (guerrini et al., 2002).
the neuroprotection observed after treatment with  xxxg1805xxx ␣
agonists has been related to a number of mechanisms, including oxidative stress modulation and anti-inflammatory
effects. it has been shown that the  xxxg1805xxx ␣ agonist-induced

the beneficial effects of  xxxd2096xxx  observed in this
study were also at least partially attributable to its antiinflammatory action: the decrease in low molecular weight
urinary proteins and reduction in local tissue inflammation showed that it prevented systemic inflammation and
also significantly decreased renal mrna expression of the
inflammatory cytokines  xxxg357xxx , il-1␤, and tgf-1␤. these
findings are in line with those of previous in vitro and in
vivo experimental studies showing that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ ligands
decrease the expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules (marx et al., 1999) and repress the expression of a
number of acute-phase proteins in rodent liver (kockx et
al., 1999). similar findings have been described in clinical
trials in which fibrate-treated patients with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases had reduced plasma levels
of cytokines,  xxxg520xxx , and fibrinogen (madej et
al., 1998; staels et al., 1998).
although studies of the molecular mechanisms of action of
 xxxg1805xxx -␣ have shown that their anti-inflammatory effects are
caused by their antagonizing the activity of nuclear factor-␬b
and the inducible  xxxg1884xxx  signaling pathway (poynter and daynes, 1998; staels et al., 1998; marx et al., 1999),
the molecular determinants underlying the effects of  xxxg1805xxx ␣
agonists are not entirely clear.
in conclusion, we demonstrate that  xxxg1805xxx ␣ activators have
beneficial effects on spontaneous brain and renal damage in
shrsps, and that these effects are at least partially caused
by the inhibition of systemic inflammation and oxidative
stress. these properties of  xxxg1805xxx ␣ activators may be useful
in patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures or in hypertensive patients with renal diseases, who are at high risk
of stroke.
