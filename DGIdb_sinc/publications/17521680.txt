abstract
decreased sweat secretion is a primary side effect of topiramate in pediatric patients, but the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear.
this study aimed to better understand how topiramate decreases sweat secretion by examining its effect on the expression of carbonic anhydrase
(ca) ii and aquaporin-5 (aqp5), total ca activity, as well as on tissue morphology of sweat glands in mice. both developing and mature mice
were treated with a low (20 mg/kg/day) and high dose (80 mg/kg/day) of topiramate for 4 weeks. sweat secretion was investigated by an
established technique of examining mold impressions of hind paws. ca ii and aqp5 expression levels were determined by immunofluorescence
and immunoblotting and ca activity by a colorimetric assay. in mature mice, topiramate treatment decreased the number of pilocarpine reactive
sweat glands from baseline in both the low and high dose groups by 83% and 75%, respectively. a similar decrease was seen in developing mice.
mature mice with reactive sweat glands that declined more than 25% compared to baseline were defined as anhidrotic mice. these mice did not
differ from controls in average secretory coil diameter, ca ii expression and ca activity. in contrast, anhidrotic mice did show a reduction in
membrane aqp5 expression in sweat glands after topiramate delivery. thus, sweat secretion and membrane aqp5 expression in mouse sweat
glands decreased following topiramate administration. these results suggest dysregulation of aqp5 may be involved in topiramate-induced
hypohidrosis and topiramate may serve as a novel therapy for hyperhidrosis.

introduction
topiramate is a monosaccharide d-fructose derivate that
functions as a sulfamate and is currently used to treat epilepsy.
the drug has multiple known mechanisms of action including
blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels, potentiating

tor, and inhibiting carbonic anhydrase (ca) isoenzymes ii and
iv (shank et al., 2000).
topiramate is generally well tolerated, however, several
reports (arcas et al., 2001; nieto-barrera et al., 2002; sanchez
calso and anton sanz, 2002; de carolis et al., 2003; ben-zeev
et al., 2003; cerminara et al., 2006) have described adverse
effects such as hypohidrosis, heat intolerance and hyperthermia,
primarily in children. these effects are reversible, but can be
clinically significant during heat stress and exercise challenge.
although more prevalent in children, the undesirable side
effects of topiramate are also seen in adults; in one case study,
severe hyperthermia and subsequent ataxia and tremor were
reported (galicia et al., 2005).

although hypohidrosis is an adverse effect of topiramate
when used for other indications, its anti-sweat producing effects
may be beneficial in conditions of hyperhidrosis. this potential
therapeutic effect was supported by the finding that a patient
with palmar–plantar hyperhidrosis improved significantly with
topiramate therapy after other medications regularly used for
this indication had failed (owen and meffert, 2003). how
topiramate induces its antiperspirant effects is unclear, but
accumulating evidence suggests it may block sweating by
acting directly on the sweat glands. first, after topiramate
administration, normal cardiovascular autonomic function and
circadian rhythm of body core temperature were noted, which
excludes systemic dysautonomia and indicates that central and
peripheral thermoregulatory function was intact (de carolis
et al., 2003). second, both the thermoregulatory sweat test and
sweat response stimulated by pilocarpine were reduced with
topiramate (de carolis et al., 2003; ben-zeev et al., 2003;
cerminara et al., 2006), suggesting a postganglionic sympathetic sudomotor failure (low, 2003). finally, topiramate does
not have appreciable binding affinity for muscarinic receptors in
rats (shank et al., 1994) and thus probably does not act on m3
muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which are expressed in sweat
glands of rat and human. although these evidences point to a
direct action of topiramate on sweat glands, the exact
mechanism that causes hypohidrosis remains unclear. a better
understanding of these mechanism(s) will provide a rational
basis for precautionary measures for topiramate-related hypohidrosis and a new therapy for hyperhidrosis.
one mechanism by which topiramate may exert its
hypohidrosis effects is via inhibiting ca isoenzymes i and ii
which are localized in human eccrine sweat glands (de carolis
et al., 2003; cerminara et al., 2006).  xxxd3564xxx , another
anticonvulsant that also inhibits ca, has been shown to cause
oligohidrosis and fever in pediatric patients (okumura et al.,
1996; shimizu et al., 1997; knudsen et al., 2003; low et al.,
2004). topiramate decreased ca activity in mouse lung and
tumor microvessel endothelial cells as well as expression of
aquaporin (aqp)-1, a member of the aquaporin family of waterselective membrane pores (ma et al., 2004). it may also inhibit
the aqp5 subtype present in sweat glands since aquaporins
have a similar molecular configuration. if this possibility was
true, it would explain the elevated sweat electrolyte concentration in patients showing decreased sweating (ben-zeev et al.,
2003; cerminara et al., 2006).
therefore, the purpose of this study was to first determine if
topiramate decreases sweat secretion in mice, as it can do in
humans, and, if so, to examine its effects on ca ii and aqp5
expression in sweat glands. in addition, ca activity and tissue
morphology of sweat glands were examined following
topiramate administration.
materials and methods
animals and drug treatment
balb/c mice aged 2 weeks and 2 months were provided by
the laboratory animal center, fourth military medical

university (fmmu, xi'an, china). the experimental protocols
followed were approved by the fmmu committee of animal
use for research and education and conformed to the national
institute of health guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals (nih publications no. 80-23). topiramate was
generously provided by xi'an-janssen pharmaceutical ltd.
and dissolved in deionized water. animals were housed under
standard conditions with water and food available ad libitum.
for 4 weeks, topiramate was administered orally twice daily in a
volume according to the weight of the mice. both developing
and mature mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 12
per group): i) low dose topiramate (20 mg/kg/day); ii) high dose
topiramate (80 mg/kg/day); and iii) control group (saline in
equal volume).
sweat secretion assay
procedures for the sweat secretion assay have been described
in detail previously (kennedy et al., 1984; kennedy and sakuta,
1984; vilches et al., 1995). in brief, sweating was stimulated by
subcutaneous injection of pilocarpine (5 mg/kg; sigma, st.
louis, mo, usa) into the back. in order to abolish emotional
sweating, the distal innervation of the paw was blocked by
injecting 0.05 ml of 0.75%  xxxd383xxx  at the ankle before the
pilocarpine injection. ten minutes later, silicone molds
(silasoft® normal, detax, gmbh & co., ettlingen, germany)
of the hind paws were made and sweat droplet impressions were
counted under a dissecting microscope using transmitted light.
counts of the number of sweat droplets were made for defined
subdivisions of the six footpads. values of sudomotor responses
to pilocarpine stimulation are expressed as the absolute number
of sweat impressions in the mold. the diameter of each sweat
impression in the flat area of footpads was measured on the
photographs of impression molds using nih image software
(national institutes of health, bethesda, md, usa), and used
to calculate the volume of sweat droplets considered to
approximate a sphere (volumes = 4/3pir3). baseline measurements were made twice prior to topiramate treatment and
thereafter each mouse was assayed once every 2 weeks. rodent
sweat glands and their sudomotor function develop postnatally
and the number of  xxxd2950xxx activated sweat glands did not
reach maximum until 30 days of age (navarro et al., 1988). in
this study, baseline counts were absent in the developing mice
and the sweating assay was only performed after 4 weeks of
drug treatment. all results are shown as mean ± sem.
tissue morphology and immunofluorescence
animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg, i.p.; sigma) and then perfused with 0.9% saline,
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer
(pb, ph 7.4). the plantar skin of the hind paw was carefully
removed. some tissue was immersed in fixative containing 2%
paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate
buffer for at least 1 day at 4 °c. tissue was rinsed in pb
containing saline (pbs), postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide,
rinsed, dehydrated, and embedded in epon 812 (polysciences

inc., warrington, pa, usa). plastic sections (1 mum) were
stained with alcoholic toluidine blue. other sections from the
same animal were equilibrated with 20% sucrose in 0.1 m pb at
4 °c overnight and cryostat sections (20 mum) were serially cut
through the footpads for immunolabeling.
sweat gland morphology was examined in toluidine bluestained plastic-embedded sections as described (song et al., 2002).
secretory coil diameter was measured on sections from each mouse
using nih image software, with 20–25 coil diameters averaged.
for immunolabeling, free-floating cryostat sections were
washed in 0.01 m kpbs, then incubated overnight at 4 °c with
rabbit polyclonal antibody against ca ii (1:200, santa cruz,
south san francisco, ca, usa) or aqp5 (1:500, calbiochem,
san diego, ca, usa). primary antiserum was diluted in 0.01 m
kpbs containing 1% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum
albumin, and 0.3% triton x-100. following three rinses in
kpbs, sections were incubated with secondary texas redconjugated donkey anti-rabbit igg or fluorescein isothiocyanate
(fitc)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit igg (1:500, molecular
probes, eugene, or, usa) in dilution buffer for 2 h. the labeled
sections were rinsed and cover-slipped in 0.01 m pbs containing
80% glycerol. control samples were processed in parallel as
described above, but primary antibodies were omitted. these
negative controls did not have demonstrable staining (not shown).
samples were examined with an olympus bx-51 microscope
equipped for epifluorescence using appropriate filters.
tissue preparation for biochemical analysis
samples of mouse paw skin were gently removed on ice,
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °c. they were
then homogenized with a potter-elvehjem homogenizer on ice
in buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm edta, 1 mm
sodium azide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml
 xxxd2393xxx , and 4 mg/ml leupeptin. epidermis
was discarded after tissue homogenization. homogenates were
centrifuged at 800 ×g for 15 min at 4 °c, and the supernatant
was split into three equal portions, which were prepared for
subsequent ca activity assay, and ca ii and aqp5
immunoblotting.
immunoblot analysis
for aqp5 immunoblotting, membranes were isolated, as
described previously (king et al., 1997; nejsum et al., 2002).
briefly, supernatant, obtained by the above-described procedure, was spun at 200,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °c to produce a
pellet containing plasma membranes and intracellular vesicles.
crude membrane pellets were solubilized in 1.5% (w/v) sds
and total protein concentration of samples was measured by
using the bio-rad rc/dc reagent kit (bio-rad laboratories,
hercules, ca, usa).
sds-page and immunoblotting were performed as described elsewhere (king et al., 1997; nejsum et al., 2002).
aliquots (60 mug of total protein) of the supernatants or
membrane fraction were loaded per lane on 12% sdspolyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose mem-

2463

branes. duplicate gels were stained with coomassie brilliant
blue (bio-rad laboratories, usa) to confirm equivalence of
samples. immunoblots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography. briefly, membranes were
blocked with 5% non-fat milk in tris buffered saline with
tween for 1 h and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a
rabbit polyclonal antibody against ca ii (1:500) or aqp5
(1:1000). after washing with pbs, the membrane was
incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit igg conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (1:2000, sigma). protein bands were
visualized using super signal west pico chemiluminescent
substrate kit (pierce, rockford, il, usa). tissue from kidney or
lung of control mice was processed simultaneously as positive
controls for ca ii or aqp5. the relative protein levels were
determined by analyzing the signals of autoradiograms using a
transmitter-scanning video densitometer. data was expressed as
a percentage of the control value (mean ± sem).
ca activity assay
ca activity was analyzed according to an established
procedure (brion et al., 1988). the basic principle of the
assay is that the hydration of co2 acidifies the solution, as noted
by the change in indicator color. briefly, water was added to the
sample to a total volume of 500 mul, which was continuously
bubbled with co2 at 150 ml/min. all reagents and the reaction
vessels were kept in an ice-water bath. then, 500 mul of
imidazole– xxxd3449xxx  plus  xxxd2821xxx  indicator (20 mm
imidazole, 5 mm tris, and 0.2 mm  xxxd2821xxx ) were added
to initiate the reaction. the reaction was stopped when the
yellow color vanished and the solution appeared nearly
colorless. a previously boiled homogenate (amount equal to
each sample) was also assayed as a control. one enzyme unit
(eu) of ca activity was defined as the amount of homogenate
necessary to halve the time of the control. protein concentration
was measured by bca method and ca activity was generally
calculated from the formula:
caðeu=mgprotþ ¼ ½logð b=s þ=½ðprotþlog2
where b and s are the times measured for paired boiled
inactivated enzyme and active sample, respectively, (prot) is
milligrams of protein used for the measurement. all assays were
performed in triplicate.
statistical analysis
the numbers of reactive sweat glands and sweat output per
gland were compared between the three groups using one-way
analysis of variance (anova) followed by a post hoc scheffe
multiple comparison test when the anova showed a
significant effect of group. for comparisons between baseline
values and values obtained following drug administration, a
paired samples t test was used. statistical significance was
assessed by independent sample t test for average secretory coil
diameter, immunoblot analysis and ca activity between
anhidrotic and control mice. statistical significance was set at

results
topiramate treatment decreased sudomotor responses
fig. 1 shows the comparison of impression molds from the
hind paws of a mouse at baseline level of sweat secretion
(fig. 1a) and the same mouse after 4 weeks of topiramate

treatment (fig. 1b). following topiramate administration, the
number of reactive sweat glands declined prominently. table 1
shows the number of sweat glands responsive to pilocarpine and
sweat output per gland in topiramate-treated and control groups.
because the number of  xxxd2950xxx activated sweat glands did
not reach maximum until 30 days of age, reactive sweat glands
in developing mice were compared to their age-matched
controls. following 4 weeks of treatment, the number of
pilocarpine reactive sweat glands was significantly lower in
developing mice given the low and high doses of topiramate
than in controls (83% and 77% of the control, respectively;
p b 0.05). in mature mice, the number of reactive sweat glands
decreased progressively with increasing treatment duration.
total secreting sweat glands did not change notably over the
following 2 weeks in groups given topiramate at the low or high
dose, while it decreased significantly from baseline values at the
fourth week of treatment (83% and 75% of baseline,
respectively; p b 0.05). however, both doses of the drug equally
affected the number of reactive sweat glands in mice of the same
age. a total of eight mature mice showed a greater than 25%
decline in reactive sweat glands compared to baseline and were
selected as anhidrotic mice for subsequent analysis, three in the
low and five in the high dose group.
the sweat output per gland also decreased progressively
with increasing treatment time, more in high dose group than in
low dose group (p b 0.05, table 1). in mature mice the decrease
in sweat volume was more pronounced than the decline in
number of secreting sweat glands, reaching a significant
difference with respect to baseline values at the second week
of treatment (p b 0.05, table 1).
effects of topiramate on tissue morphology and immunolabeling for ca ii and aqp5
the effects of topiramate on sweat gland morphology (ducts
and coils) are illustrated by representative toluidine blue-stained
sections of anhidrotic and control mouse paws in fig. 2. these
groups of mice did not differ in average secretory coil diameter
(fig. 2c).
in the footpad of control mice, ca ii immunolabeling was
moderate in the basolateral, apical plasma membrane and
cytoplasm of secretory cells of the sweat gland coil (fig. 3a).
sweat glands in anhidrotic mice were similar to controls in the

distribution, intensity, and specificity of ca ii staining
(fig. 3b). consistent with previous studies (nejsum et al.,
2002; song et al., 2002), aqp5 labeling in controls was
abundantly present in the luminal membrane domains of the
secretory parts of sweat glands (fig. 3c). the same distribution
pattern of aqp5 staining was found in the sweat glands of
topiramate-treated anhidrotic mice (fig. 3d); however, the
labeling intensity in the secretory parts of sweat glands was
considerably lower compared to controls. these results suggest
that treatment with topiramate did not alter the localization of
aqp5, but decreased the amount of the protein in sweat glands
of anhidrotic mice.

topiramate did not affect ca ii expression or total ca activity
immunoblot analysis demonstrated an approximately 29 kda
band corresponding to the ca ii in both topiramate and control
groups (fig. 4a). representative immunoblots of ca ii from
paws of anhidrotic mice failed to reveal changes in expression
compared to control mice (fig. 4a). this lack of an effect of
topiramate on ca ii expression was confirmed with densitometric analyses (fig. 4c left).
topiramate appeared to slightly reduce ca activity by about
7% in anhidrotic mice (1.33 ± 0.32 eu/mg prot; n = 5) compared
to controls (1.43 ± 0.29 eu/mg prot; n = 6), however the

that topiramate administration significantly decreased the expression of aqp5 (⁎p b 0.01) but not ca ii in sweat glands of anhidrotic mice (n = 5) compared with
controls (n = 6). values are expressed as a percentage of the control value (mean ± sem).

reduction was not significant. these data suggest that ca
activity in paws of anhidrotic mice did not change significantly
after 4 weeks of topiramate treatment.
topiramate decreased apq5 protein expression
in contrast to ca ii expression, aqp5 expression decreased
in the anhidrotic mice. as shown in fig. 4b an approximately
27 kda band corresponding to aqp5 was evident and
densitometric analysis revealed that topiramate administration
decreased aqp5 expression in sweat glands of anhidrotic mice
by about six fold compared to controls (fig. 4c right; p b 0.01).
discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that topiramate
decreased sweat secretion in mice. furthermore, in topiramate-treated anhidrotic mice, membrane aqp5 expression in
sweat glands was reduced, whereas ca ii expression and ca
activity were unaltered. the number of pilocarpine reactive
sweat glands in mice treated with topiramate for 4 weeks was
significantly lower than before treatment or than in their agematched controls. these changes in reactive sweat glands in
anhidrotic mice were not accompanied by changes in tissue
morphology (as evidenced by average secretory coil diameter),
ca ii expression or ca activity. in contrast, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting showed that topiramate administration significantly reduced membrane aqp5 expression in sweat
glands of anhidrotic mice. thus, these results suggest that
topiramate-related hypohidrosis might be attributed to the
down-regulation of membrane aqp5 protein in sweat glands.
the number of reactive sweat glands and sweat volume in
mice declined progressively after topiramate administration
indicating that this species can be used to investigate potential
mechanisms underlying topiramate-related hypohidrosis. if
hypohidrosis-associated symptoms occur in patients undergoing topiramate therapy, they usually develop between 2 and
6 months after reaching target dosage and/or coincident with
either the onset of environmental heat or exercise (cerminara
et al., 2006). the relatively long delay between achieving the

intended dose and the appearance of the symptoms suggests a
progressive effect of topiramate on sudomotor function rather
than an idiosyncratic reaction.
age, dose, and environmental temperature are risk factors for
topiramate-associated hyperthermia and hypohidrosis (ziad
et al., 2005). our results regarding the sweat output per gland
also suggest that topiramate has a dose-dependent effect on
sweat secretion. in contrast, the age at which topiramate was
administered does not affect the number of reactive sweat
glands or sweat output per gland, as they are similar between
developing and mature mice. this finding appears to differ from
that in humans in which children tend to develop topiramaterelated hypohidrosis more frequently than adults (ben-zeev
et al., 2003; huang et al., 2004; ziad et al., 2005). but unlike
humans, rodents do not employ sweating as a significant
component in thermoregulation. the predisposition of children
for hypohidrosis observed in clinical situation may be related to
their lower sweating rate per gland and to higher surface-areato-mass ratio. when air temperature is higher than that of the
skin, heat dissipation depends greatly on the evaporation of
sweat, consequently, the core temperature of prepubertal
children is greater than that of young adults owing to the
underdevelopment of sweating (inoue et al., 2004).
contrary to our expectations, neither ca ii expression nor
ca activity is abnormal in topiramate-induced anhidrotic mice.
we suggest two possible reasons for this lack of effect. first,
topiramate is a relatively weak ca inhibitor, for example, it is
10 to 100 times less potent than the ca inhibitor acetazolamide
(dodgson et al., 2003). these data are consistent with the
possibility that the inhibitory effect of topiramate on ca activity
is tissue specific (ma et al., 2004). second, the techniques used
in our study cannot specifically measure ca in sweat glands.
since ca i and ii have been detected in the epidermis of human
skin (mastrolorenzo et al., 2003) and small amounts of
epidermis was present in our samples, the levels of ca ii
expression and ca activity in sweat glands were most likely
overestimated.
the absence of an effect of topiramate on ca expression and
activity suggests that this is not the mechanism for its anhidrotic
effects. this finding is in accord with several lines of evidence

l. ma et al. / life sciences 80 (2007) 2461–2468

which suggested that ca is not a major factor in the formation
of sweat. first, ca does not play an important role in the na–
k–cl co-transporter model for the ionic mechanism of eccrine
sweat secretion (sato et al., 1989). second, the ca ii deficiency
syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with
osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis and cerebral calcification,
does not have evidence of decreased sweat secretion (sly and
hu, 1995). third, decreased sweating has not been described as
a side effect of potent ca inhibitors such as acetazolamide,
although acetazolamide is known to reduce whole-body sweat
loss and decrease submaximal exercise tolerance under
normoxic and hypoxic conditions (brechue and stager, 1990).
however, potential mechanisms for reduced sweating and
exercise capacity include the effect of acidosis on muscle
function, dehydration due to diuretic effect, and increased
dyspnea due to stimulation of ventilation (garske et al., 2003).
thus, it is unlikely that the anhidrotic effect of topiramate is due
to the inhibition of ca ii.
in contrast to ca ii expression, membrane aqp5 expression
markedly decreased in topiramate-induced anhidrotic mice in
our study. this result suggests that aqp5 is essential for sweat
secretion and is consistent with a previous report that the
number of  xxxd2950xxx active sweat glands drastically reduced
in aqp5-null mice (nejsum et al., 2002). however, song et al.
(2002) failed to replicate this result. in anhidrotic horses, the
level of aqp5 expression reduced with the duration of
anhidrosis, implicating water channel impairment as a possible
factor in the development of this disorder (bovell et al., 2006).
thus, decreased expression of aqp5 may contribute to
anhidrosis induced by topiramate.
aqp5 is a member of the aquaporins class of membrane
proteins that transport water across the plasma membrane (king
et al., 2004; takata et al., 2004). it is usually expressed in apical
plasma membranes of secretory glands such as salivary,
lacrimal, and sweat glands. specifically, aqp5 is abundant in
secretory parts of sweat glands in mouse, rat, and human, as
revealed by immunohistochemical labeling (nejsum et al.,
2002). the function of aqp5 in sweat glands is not fully
understood. similar to sweat glands, rat salivary glands have
abundant apical aqp5 in serous gland cells. previous studies
have suggested that aqp5 is a target molecule for sympathetic
or parasympathetic control of saliva production (ishikawa et al.,
2006). this outcome may possibly require translocation of
aqp5 water channel proteins to the apical plasma membrane or
other forms of activation. interestingly, the impaired responsiveness of aqp5 to m3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors
results in xerostomia, or dry mouth (inoue et al., 2003). thus,
dysregulation of aqp5 will probably lead to an impaired
epithelial fluid transport.
based on evidence that some of the effects of topiramate on
ampa/kainate receptors are influenced by the phosphorylation
state of the receptors, it has been postulated that topiramate may
bind to these membrane channel complexes at phosphorylation
sites in the inner loop and thereby exert allosteric modulatory
effects (shank et al., 2000). phosphorylation may play an
important role in the translocation of aqp isoforms. protein
kinase g phosphorylates aqp2 on the c terminal residue and

2467

increases the insertion of aqp2 into renal epithelial cells
(bouley et al., 2000). thus, it seems reasonable to postulate that
possible modulatory effects of topiramate on aqp5 protein
phosphorylation would result in a decrease of aqp5 translocation to the apical plasma membrane. on the other hand,
effects of topiramate on the synthesis or degradation of aqp5
protein by unknown mechanisms may also contribute to the
reduced membrane aqp5 expression in sweat glands of
anhidrotic mice seen in our study. although our results suggest
that topiramate-related hypohidrosis might be attributed to the
down-regulation of membrane aqp5 protein in sweat glands, it
is necessary to examine the effect of topiramate on sweat
secretion from aqp5-null mice.
 xxxg437xxx 
(cftr) is a  xxxg437xxx  protein and
plays an important role in sweat secretion and salt reabsorption
in sweat glands (rowe et al., 2005). similar to topiramateinduced hypohidrosis, dysfunction of cftr in cystic fibrosis
(cf) results in salty sweat. however, it is unlikely that
topiramate inhibits cftr in the secretary cells of sweat glands.
first, patients with cf do not show significant decrease in sweat
secretion because elevating of camp can only stimulate small
amounts of sweating. second, sweat secretion in rodent is
exclusively mediated by cholinergic-induced increase in ca2+
but not by elevating of camp (grant and landis, 1991).
therefore, our result that topiramate could decrease sweat
secretion in mice rules out the possible inhibitory effect of
topiramate on cftr.
one limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size
of anhidrotic mice. however, it is unlikely that inclusion of
more topiramate-treated mice with reactive sweat glands that
declined less than 25% for comparison with controls will
provide a more convincing result because of the apparent
individual variation in topiramate's inhibitory effect on
sudomotor function.
conclusion
in summary, our data suggest that topiramate impairs
sudomotor function in mice and leads to a significant reduction
in membrane aqp5 expression in sweat glands of anhidrotic
mice, thus raising the possibility that dysregulation of aqp5
may contribute to topiramate-related hypohidrosis. ca inhibition may not be an important contributor since ca ii expression
and ca activity were intact in anhidrotic mice treated with
topiramate. although aqps have been proposed as potential
drug targets for the treatment of various diseases, potent
pharmacological modulators of aqps are still lacking (wang
et al., 2006). our results indicate that topiramate may serve as a
potential modulator of aqp5 and a novel therapy for
hyperhidrosis.
