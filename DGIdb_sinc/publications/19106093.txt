when life adapted to a terrestrial habitat, removal of excess
and potentially neurotoxic ammonia by the diffusion that
occurred in an aquatic habitat was no longer possible (1). arginine biosynthetic pathways almost certainly served as the precursors for the urea cycle, the present day metabolic pathway
for removal of excess ammonia, with surprisingly few changes
needed for the pathway evolution (2). carbamoyl phosphate

limiting step of the urea cycle, was the site of four of these
critical evolutionary changes: (a) gain of communication with a
sensor of excess amino acids, n-acetylglutamate (aga, which
serves as a required allosteric activator only for urea-synthesizing cpss), (b) a decrease in km for ammonia to ⬃1 mm from the
⬃100 mm value for other cpss, (c) loss of interaction with glutamine to avoid competition with the preferred substrate
ammonia, and (d) localization to the hepatic mitochondrial
matrix to allow independent regulation relative to cpss with
other metabolic roles. structural changes have been identified
in hcps that correlate with the latter two functional changes
(3–5); the cysteine residue required for releasing ammonia
from glutamine has been replaced by serine, and hcps is synthesized with 39 n-terminal residues that serve as a mitochondrial matrix targeting signal and that are cleaved as the hcps
precursor crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane. the
structural basis for the first two critical functional features,
aga interaction and high affinity for ammonia, however, have
not yet been elucidated nor has it been determined whether
these two features are linked.
cpss from all species with varied metabolic roles share
strong sequence identity, and all appear to have the same overall domain organization (6) (fig. 1) observed in the crystal
structure of e. coli cps (ecps), the only solved cps structure
(7). all known cpss appear to utilize a common mechanism
(fig. 1) to catalyze the formation of carbamoyl phosphate (cp),
pi, and two molecules of adp from ammonia (either free in the
cell or generated from the hydrolysis of glutamine), bicarbonate, and two molecules of atp (6). a variety of studies have
yielded evidence for a cycle of conformational changes accompanying the catalytic cycle (6 – 8). vertebrate urea-specific
cpss, including hcps, incorporate an additional type of conformational control in the form of dependence on the allosteric
activator aga. in the absence of aga, a very small fraction of
urea-specific cps is in a conformation capable of catalytic
activity, whereas binding of aga yields cps with activity
equivalent to that of ecps and other non-aga-dependent
cpss (6). although aga functions as an intermediate in arginine biosynthesis in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, the only
known function for aga in vertebrates is activation of ureaspecific cpss (9). co-localization of aga synthetase in the
hepatic mitochondrial matrix is consistent with this dedicated

human carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (hcps) has evolved
critical features that allow it to remove excess and potentially
neurotoxic ammonia via the urea cycle, including use of only
free ammonia as a nitrogen donor, a km for ammonia 100-fold
lower than for cpss that also use glutamine as a nitrogen donor,
and required allosteric activation by n-acetylglutamate (aga),
a sensor of excess amino acids. the recent availability of a schizosaccharomyces pombe expression system for hcps allowed us
to utilize protein engineering approaches to elucidate the distinctive hcps properties. although the site of aga interaction
is not defined, it is known that the binding of aga to cps leads
to a conformational change in which a pair of cysteine side
chains become proximate and can then be selectively induced to
undergo disulfide bonding. we analyzed the response of hcps cysteine mutants to thiol-specific reagents and identified cys-1327
and cys-1337 as the aga-responsive proximate cysteines. possibly two of the features unique to urea-specific cpss, relative to
other cpss (the conserved cys-1327/cys-1337 pair and the occurrence at very high concentrations in the liver mitochondrial
matrix) co-evolved to provide buffering against reactive oxygen
species. reciprocal mutation analysis of escherichia coli cps
(ecps), creating p909c and g919c and establishing the ability of
these engineered cysteine residues to share a disulfide bond, indicated an ecps conformational change at least partly similar to the
hcps conformational change induced by aga. these findings
strongly suggested an alternative ecps conformation relative to
the single crystal conformation thus far identified.

experimental procedures
recombinant dna methods—bacterial transformations and
recombinant dna techniques were carried out as described in
sambrook et al. (13). site-directed mutants were created using
nested pcr. each mutagenesis cassette was sequenced to verify
that no undesired changes were incorporated into the nucleotide sequence. mutagenesis primers (mutated base pairs in
bold) and outside non-mutagenic primers corresponding to the
coding strand sequence were as follows. primers used for ecps
mutants (5⬘–3⬘) were: np909cf1, ccgctgttagggtgtgaaatgcgatcgaccggg; np909cr1, cccggtcgatcgcatttcacaccctaacagcgg; ng919cf1, gcgatcgaccggggaagtcatgtgcgtggg; ng919cr1, cccacgcacatgacttccccggtcgatcgc; mopf1, ccggttatcggcaccagcccgg; mopr1, gcctctccccgcgcgttggccg; mopf2, cgtgaacgcttccagcatgcggttgagcg; mopr2, cacgacaggtttcccgactggaaagcgg. primers used for hcps mutants (5⬘–3⬘) were:

cps expression and purification—the protocol for expression and purification of recombinant wild type ecps and for its
site-directed mutants was as previously described (14). the

expressed ecps was comprised of both subunits. the expression/purification protocol for wild type and mutant hcpss was
as described (12). the expressed hcps was the mature protein
(1462 amino acid residues) with the first 39 amino acids of the
precursor protein replaced by a methionine and an n-terminal
his6-flag威 tag (yielding the n-terminal sequence hhhhhhdykdddkmsvkaq, with the tag residues italicized). the
fusion tag was not removed from the purified hcps because (a)
it appeared to be functionally neutral (12) and (b) in previous
studies with frog cps expressed as a fusion protein (14),
attempts to remove the fusion tag resulted in cleavage of cps,
apparently at the links between domains that are extremely
susceptible to proteolysis. recombinant hcps corresponded to
gene id 1373 (gene symbol cpsi, refseq transcript variant 2,
nm_001875; threonine-1406 variant). the purity of all protein
preparations was at least 95%, as assessed by coomassie blue
staining of sds-page gels (15). protein concentration was estimated using the dye binding assay of bradford with bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as the standard (16) or by a280 (0.685/mg ecps)
(17).
cps activity assays and data analysis—cp synthesis was
determined in a two-step assay by coupling the cps reaction to
that of ornithine transcarbamoylase and then quantitating the
resulting citrulline (14, 18). the reaction mixtures contained 50
mm hepes, 100 mm kcl, 10 mm atp, 20 mm mgcl2, 20 mm
nahco3, 5 mm ornithine, 0.2 units ornithine transcarbamoylase, and either 300 mm nh4cl or 10 mm glutamine and were
initiated by the addition of cps (final volume 100 ␮l, ph 7.6).
for hcps assay, 5 mm aga was included, kcl was reduced to
10 mm, nh4cl was reduced to 30 mm, and ornithine was
increased to 20 mm. standard incubation was at 37 °c for
20 min.
atpase activities were determined in a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (18), where the formation of
adp (with 2 adp produced per cp synthesized) is coupled to
nadh oxidation as monitored continuously at 340 nm. the
reaction mixtures contained variable atp, 50 mm hepes, 100
mm kcl, 20 mm mgcl2, 40 mm nahco3, 10 mm ornithine, 1
mm sodium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm nadh, 18 units
pyruvate kinase, and 24 units of lactate dehydrogenase. for
hcps assay, 5 mm aga was included, kcl was reduced to 10
mm, and ornithine was omitted. to determine ammonium-dependent atpase activity, 300 mm nh4cl (30 mm for hcps) was
included in the reaction mixture, and to determine glutaminedependent atpase activity, 10 mm glutamine was included.
whereas only the unprotonated form of ammonia (nh3) is a
substrate for cps (19), the data are presented as the total of
nh4⫹ ⫹ nh3 because it was the level of nh4cl that was varied
during the experiments. under the assay conditions, nh3 represented about 4% of the nh4cl (pka 9.25) added to the solution (19). for determination of bicarbonate-dependent atpase
activity in domain b, the assay was carried out in the absence of
both nh4cl and glutamine. for determination of allosteric
effects, the assay was conducted in the absence of ornithine or
in the presence of 0.1 mm ump. assays were monitored for
10 –20 min at 25 °c after the addition of 5–50 ␮g of cps.
atp synthesis was assayed by coupling atp formation from
adp and cp to the hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehyvolume 284 • number 9 • february 27, 2009

role, as is the fact that increases in the substrate glutamate signal increased degradation of proteins to yield both free amino
acids and free ammonia. allosteric activation of vertebrate
aga synthetase by arginine provides a further link to the presence of excess amino acids and the accompanying excess of free
ammonia requiring detoxification.
one reporter for the aga-activated conformation of cps is
a pair of cysteine side chains that become proximate upon aga
binding and that can then be selectively induced to undergo
disulfide bonding (10, 11). in the absence of aga, only a small
fraction of cps is in a conformation with the cysteine pair proximate. this single pair of proximate sulfhydryl groups is
uniquely modified when the aga䡠cps complex is exposed to a
variety of disulfide-inducing reagents, and reversible activity
loss accompanies disulfide formation. the recent availability
(12) of a schizosaccharomyces pombe expression system for
hcps allowed us to utilize protein engineering approaches for
elucidation of the distinctive hcps properties. to identify the
residues of the cysteine reporter group, we have analyzed the
response of hcps cysteine mutants to thiol-specific reagents.
we also have examined the potential for a conformational
change in ecps that parallels the aga-induced conformational change of hcps. thus far only a single conformation of
ecps has been revealed from x-ray structural analysis. defining
the cycle of conformational changes that accompany the catalytic cycle and that allow synchronization of three active sites
( xxxg920xxx  site and two distinct atp sites) to
produce cp, therefore, remains a major challenge.

results and discussion
effects of c1327a and c1337a substitutions on the function
of hcps—previous studies have established that a pair of cysteine side chains become proximate upon aga binding to
urea-specific cps and that the cysteine residues can then be
selectively induced to undergo disulfide bonding (10, 11). this
single pair of proximate sulfhydryl groups is uniquely modified
when the aga䡠cps complex is exposed to a variety of disulfideinducing reagents, and reversible activity loss accompanies
disulfide formation. the specificity of these reactions must
depend on the relative unreactivity or inaccessibility of the
other 18 hcps cysteinyl residues. earlier studies (11, 22) have
identified one of the cysteine pair in hcps as either cys-1327 or
cys-1337. to identify both residues of the cysteine reporter
group, we first constructed the hcps mutants c1327a and
c1337a and analyzed their responses to thiol-specific reagents.
the effect of the mutations themselves on the function of
hcps was determined by analyzing the overall and partial reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. the synthesis of cp requires
coordination of two hcps active sites with atp cleavage occurring at duplicated atp grasp domains b and c (fig. 1). individual contributions of these active sites to the overall reaction are
reflected in two partial reactions, 1) at atpb, a bicarbonate-defebruary 27, 2009 • volume 284 • number 9

the addition of 5 ␮g of cps, the formation of nadph was
followed continuously at 340 nm.
glutamine hydrolysis was determined as previously
described (14). kinetic data were collected on a beckman du

v is the initial velocity, vmax is the maximal velocity, s is the

inactivation were determined by adding 10-␮l aliquots of the
reaction mixture to the cp synthesis activity assay mixture
(final reaction volume of 100 ␮l, ph 7.6) at the indicated times
and incubating at 30 °c for 20 min. to test reversal of sulfhydryl

⬃66% inactivation, and aliquots were removed at intervals for
determination of cp synthesis activity. ecps (2.5 ␮m) was modified only with 5.5 ␮m pao, and incubations were carried out at
37 °c; for protection assays, 10 mm atp plus 20 mm mgcl2 was
used.

tion, the partial reaction occurring at the domain b atp site. in
contrast, both mutations significantly altered activity at the
domain c atp site, as gauged by the cp-dependent atp synthesis partial reaction. the adp km values were 9- and 14-fold
higher than that of wt for c1337a and c1327a, respectively,
and kcat was decreased in both mutants. c1327a and c1337a
displayed 20- and 28-fold lower kcat/km values for atp formation at domain c than wild type hcps. these effects on the
domain c atp site were consistent with the previous report
that cys-1327 and/or cys-1337 reacts with the atp analog
5⬘-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (fsba) and the resulting
prediction that one or both residues are localized near the atp
site (11).
impaired functioning at domain c was also reflected in 3.7–
6.4-fold decreases in kcat/km for coupled utilization of both
atp molecules in the overall reaction, as gauged by ammoniadependent atpase activity. the mutations appeared to additionally affect interaction with aga, with mutant apparent km
values that were 7–10-fold lower than for wild type hcps. this
observation was consistent with the previous reports that the
c-terminal region of cps is involved in binding aga (24, 25).
interaction with ammonia was not significantly affected by the
mutations. whereas the specific effects of these mutations on
the kinetic parameters provided insight into the structure/
function relationship for hcps, the kinetic analysis established
that neither cys-1327 nor cys-1337 was critical for enzymatic
activity. thus, the cys-1327 and cys-1337 mutants could serve
as effective probes for thiol reactivity.
effects of c1327a and c1337a substitutions on reactivity
with thiol-selective reagents—previous studies on native rat
liver cps have established that two cysteine side chains become
proximate in the aga complex, as evidenced by the ability to
form a disulfide bond when treated with pao, a compound
that preferentially reacts with dithiols that are capable of
forming a cyclic dithioarsenite complex, pysspy, a thiol-specific reagent that can induce disulfide bond formation, or
with the atp analog fsba (10). fsba reacts with a cysteinyl
side chain to form a thiosulfonate, and subsequent attack by
a second proximate cysteinyl side chain can displace the sulfonyl-benzoyladenosine moiety to yield a disulfide bond. formation of the disulfide bond in the cps䡠aga complex could be
monitored by the accompanying enzymatic inactivation as these
two sulfhydryls were shown to be uniquely reactive. a later study
(11) used a peptide chemistry approach to establish that fsba
initially reacts with either cys-1327 or cys-1337 at one of the cps
sites labeled by this analog but was not able to identify which of
these cysteine residues was involved or which of the 20 cps cysteine residues was the partner in the disulfide bond.
to determine whether cys-1327 and/or cys-1337 are the
residues that become proximate in the cps䡠aga complex, we
analyzed the response of wild type hcps, c1327a, and c1337a
to treatment with pao. replacing either of the two proximate
cysteinyl residues with an alanine would remove the potential
for the formation of a cyclic dithioarsenite complex and, thus,
prevent the accompanying hcps inactivation. as shown in
table 2, treatment of the wild type hcps䡠aga complex with a
2.2:1 molar ratio of pao to hcps led to 90% inactivation in 20
min. when aga was omitted from the pao treatment mixvolume 284 • number 9 • february 27, 2009

ture, hcps was only 27% inactivated. this inactivation of free
hcps could have two components; (a) pao could react with
the small fraction of hcps that exists in the active conformation
in the absence of aga, with the pao reaction pulling the equilibrium mixture of active and inactive conformations toward
the active conformation as it is removed from the pool as the
inactivated disulfide species, and (b) there could be some reaction with another cysteine pair that is at least transiently proximate, possibly via random intermolecular interactions.
treatment of the aga complexes of c1327a and c1337a
yielded 36 and 42% inactivation, respectively. this significant
reduction in pao inactivation relative to the 90% observed with
wt suggested that cys-1327 and cys-1337 are the residues
that become proximate in the aga䡠hcps complex and that
then can be induced to form a disulfide bond. as was the case
for wild type hcps, both mutants showed significantly slower
loss of activity in the absence of aga (table 2). inactivation of
native cps by pao can be prevented including atp in the
reaction mixture, presumably because binding of atp at the
domain c active site sterically blocks access to reagents such as
pao and fsba (10, 11). our present studies (table 2) showed
similar atp protection against pao inactivation of the
aga䡠hcps complex, with activities of 88, 102 and 94% after 20
min of pao treatment for wt, c1327a, and c1337a, respectively. the reducing agent dtt has been shown to reverse the
inactivation of native cps caused by pao (10). significant
reversal of pao inactivation was also observed in the present
study. when enzyme with ⬃66% remaining activity was treated
for 10 s with 10 mm dtt, activities of 93, 92, and 90% were
observed for wt, c1327a and c1337a, respectively. taken
together, these findings indicated that cys-1327 and cys-1337
constitute the aga-responsive proximate cysteine pair. the
findings also suggested that the residual ability of c1327a and
c1337a to react with pao in the absence of atp protection
resulted from the interaction of the remaining authentic disul-

fide pair member, i.e. cys-1327 or c1337, with one of the other
18 cysteine residues in hcps. presumably this additional propinquity of cysteine side chains resulted from effects of the alanine substitution on polarity experienced by nearby residues
leading to a local conformational change.
a second thiol selective reagent, pysspy, was used to confirm
the identification of cys-1327 and cys-1337 as the aga-responsive proximate cysteines as well as to possibly identify
which of the two residues is initially reactive. pysspy forms a
mixed disulfide with any reactive cysteine residue and can then
be displaced by a proximate sulfhydryl group, forming an
intramolecular disulfide. thus, in contrast to pao, pysspy
could react with only one of the proximate cysteine pair,
although reaction with both to form the cps disulfide bond was
observed with native cps (10). as previously observed for
native enzyme, the wt/aga complex rapidly lost the ability to
synthesize cp when treated with pysspy, with 62% of the original activity remaining after a 10-s treatment with a 2.07:1
molar ratio of pysspy:hcps (table 2). the reaction was slower
when aga was omitted from the pysspy incubation, with 92%
activity remaining  xxxd1891xxx  s. both c1327a and c1337a displayed
parallel behavior to wt, with an almost identical loss of activity
for the aga䡠cps complex (58 and 64% activity  xxxd1891xxx  s, respectively) and with much less activity loss when aga was omitted
from the reaction mixture. it was not possible to use our data to
determine which residue is the initially reactive cysteine, but
these data did confirm that cys-1327 and cys-1337 are the
aga-responsive pair.
the aga complexes of all three constructions displayed
complete protection from pysspy inactivation when atp was
included in the incubation (table 2). as also observed for pao
treatment, pysspy inactivation of all three constructions was
significantly reversed by dtt treatment. after a 10-s treatment
with 10 mm dtt, wt activity increased to 81 from 57%,
c1327a activity increased to 96 from 71%, and c1337a activity
increased to 70 from 46%.
implications for an hcps role in buffering against reactive
oxygen species—individual mutation of either cys-1327 or
cys-1337 to alanine in hcps resulted in specific activity values
similar to that of the wild type enzyme, revealing that these
residues were not critical for the function of the enzyme. the
fact that the corresponding residues in ecps are pro-909 and
gly-919 also makes it is unlikely that either cys-1327 or cys1337 is involved in any general feature of cp synthesis. conservation of these residues in urea-specific cpss could, therefore,
indicate a critical role apart from enzymatic function.
two earlier sets of experiments suggest physiological roles
for the cys-1327/cys-1337 pair. first, studies on palmitoylation in mitochondria isolated from cos-7 cells and rat liver
found that the majority of fatty-acylated protein in the mitochondrial matrix was urea-specific cps (26). although this
study did not determine the site of palmitoylation, the findings
that reaction with  xxxd2832xxx -coa inactivated cps and that the
inactivation was prevented by atp inclusion or prior fsba
treatment are consistent with cys-1327 and/or cys-1337 as the
site(s) of palmitoylation. in the second set of earlier studies,
gautier et al. (27) reported that rat urea-specific cps could be
activated by thioredoxins isolated from rat liver. without

the hcps inactivation accompanying formation of the cys1327/cys-1337 disulfide bond also provides a rationale for one
of the more puzzling features of reye’s syndrome; that is, the
several days to several weeks that elapse between a viral infection that is treated with aspirin and the hyperammonemia
that is the cause of mortality and morbidity of this disorder
(29). temporary deficiencies in mitochondrial atp production and hcps activity have been demonstrated in reye’s
syndrome. it is possible that cys-1327/cys-1337 disulfide
bond formation is the cause of the hcpsi deficiency and that
the buildup of this oxidized hcps as atp concentrations
become lower serves as the timer for reye’s syndrome.
effects of p909c, g919c, and p909c/g919c substitutions on
the function of ecps—the residues in ecps corresponding to
the hcps residues cys-1327 and cys-1337 are pro-909 and gly919, respectively (fig. 2). to examine the potential for an ecps
conformational change that parallels the aga-induced conformational change of hcps, we performed reciprocal mutagenesis to substitute cysteine residues both individually and simultaneously at these positions in ecps. all three mutant enzymes
were able to effectively catalyze the synthesis of cp under
standard assay conditions with all
substrates in excess. the specific
activities of wt ecps, p909c,
g919c, and p909c/g919c in ␮mol
of cp/min/mg were 0.855, 0.472,
0.524, and 0.348.

(human), rattus norvegicus (rat), rana catesbeiana (bullfrog), xenopus laevis (toad), and glutamine-utilizing are shown in table 3. the most sigcpss from mesocricetus auratus (hamster), saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and e. coli are aligned to show
correspondence of cys-1327 in hcps to pro-909 in ecps and cys-1337 in hcps to gly-919 in ecps (highlighted nificant effects of mutations were
in blue). residues conserved in all of the cps sequences are highlighted in yellow.
on the interaction with atp. when
reduction of the thioredoxins by dtt, no activation of cps was
observed. subsequent studies have revealed that thioredoxins
constitute a family of 12-kda proteins with thioredoxin 2 present in mitochondria. it is possible that thioredoxin 2 could serve
as a reduction/oxidation sensitive regulator of hcps activity
under physiological conditions via interaction with the cys1327/cys-1337 pair.
urea-specific cps is the major protein in the liver mitochondrial matrix, making up 15–20% that of the total protein in the
mitochondrial matrix and occurring at an estimated in vivo
concentration of 70 mg/ml (28). thus, cps has the potential
ability to serve as a buffer against oxidative stress in the liver cell,
especially under conditions of energy stress where atp levels are
low. in this situation aga䡠cps complexes could be oxidized to
form the cys-1327/cys-1337 disulfide bond and thereby prevent
interaction of the reactive oxygen species with other, less prevalent
proteins, dna or other molecules. possibly two of the features
unique to urea-specific cpss, relative to other cpss (the conserved
cys-1327/cys-1337 pair and the occurrence at very high concentrations in the liver mitochondrial matrix) co-evolved to provide
buffering against reactive oxygen species.

carbons of pro-909 and gly-919 are 23.97 å apart, far from
the average disulfide bond length of 5.99 å (fig. 3). thus,
identification of a disulfide bond between the engineered
cysteinyl residues would also serve to identify an alternative
ecps conformation.
as shown in table 4, treatment of wild type ecps, p909c, or
g919c with a 2.2:1 molar ratio of pao to cps had essentially
no effect on activity. these findings indicated the absence of
vicinal cysteinyl residues in wt ecps as well as the absence of
a cysteine residue vicinal to p909c or g919c that could be
induced to form a disulfide with the newly created cysteine. in

coupled use of both atps was assayed with ammonia and
glutamine, respectively, as nitrogen donor, p909c/g919c
displayed 13- and 34-fold lower kcat/km and atp values, and
the two single mutants displayed smaller changes. there
were relatively minor changes in the parameters for the
bicarbonate-dependent atpase reaction, the partial reaction occurring at the domain b atp site. in contrast, p909c
had an 8-fold lower km for atpc, as gauged by the cp-dependent atp synthesis partial reaction, whereas g919c had
an 8-fold higher km for atpc. interestingly, the effects of the
single mutants behaved in an apparently additive fashion to
yield a double mutant with cp synthesis properties very similar to those of wt.
we also examined the effect of these mutations on the
allosteric behavior of ecps (table 3). ornithine, co-substrate with cp for the second step of arginine biosynthesis,
acts as a positive allosteric effector for ecps, the catalyst for
the first pathway step. ump, product of the pyrimidine
nucleotide pathway, acts as a negative allosteric effector for
ecps, which also catalyzes the first step of this pathway. it
should be noted that these effectors act as traditional allosteric effectors that alter the rate of an active unliganded
enzyme rather then acting in the non-traditional manner of
aga, the essential allosteric activator for hcps. because
allosteric effectors bind at domain d of ecps and function
primarily to alter the km for atp in domain c (7), the present mutations might provide insight into the molecular
mechanism for allosteric communication. comparison of
the kinetic parameters for the mutants to those of wt indicated that the response to ornithine is unaffected but that
the response to ump occupancy was altered, with much less
decrease in km for all three mutants as well as an increased
effect on kcat. these findings support the previous suggestion of independent routes of allosteric communication for
ornithine and ump within ecps (7).
in sum, the kinetic analysis established that neither pro-909
nor gly-919 was critical for ecps function and that activity was
not significantly impaired in the p909c/g919c double mutant.
thus, p909c/g919c could be used to probe for disulfide bond
formation that might occur if ecps assumes a conformation
that parallels the aga-induced conformation of hcps.
response of p909c, g919c, and p909c/g919c to pao
treatment—to determine whether the engineered cysteinyl
residues p909c and g919c are located in ecps positions
that allow induction of a disulfide bond, we used pao, a
compound that preferentially reacts with dithiols capable of
forming a cyclic dithioarsenite complex. we used loss of
enzymatic activity to monitor this reaction, with the
assumption that the atp grasp folds of ecps and hcps are
generally conserved. if this is the case, formation of a disulfide bond between p909c and g919c would be expected to
result in sterically blocked access to atp binding in domain
c, as was observed for the analogous disulfide bond in hcps.
this expectation is supported by the occurrence of the pro909 oxygen 3.6 å from c5 of the adp-ribose in the solved
ecps structure (7). it should be noted that the expectation of
disulfide bond formation itself is not supported by this structure, the only available solved ecps conformation. the ␣

the crystal structure. gly-919 occurs at the end of a ␤-strand
(913–921), and pro-909 falls within an extended area without
classical secondary structure (901–911). the fact that enzymatic activity was reasonably well maintained despite the drastic substitution of cysteine residues for pro-909 and gly-919
further indicated that the residues are not structurally critical.
additionally, both residues are located very near the internal
molecular tunnel proposed to connect the active sites of
domains b and c and to move the carbamate intermediate
which is highly unstable and cannot be exposed to water (32);
residues 911, 913, 914, 915, and 916 comprise part of the tunnel.
thus, conformational flexibility that would move pro-909 and
gly-919 into more proximate positions is not inconsistent with
the single available crystal structure. further work is necessary
to define this alternative conformation and its relationship to
the cycle of conformational changes that accompany the catalytic cycle and that allow synchronization of three active sites
( xxxg920xxx  site and two distinct atp sites) to
produce cp.

dramatic contrast, treatment of p909c/g919c with a low concentration of pao (2.2:1 molar ratio of pao to cps) led to
rapid inactivation, with 21% activity loss  xxxd1891xxx  s and a plateau of
⬃40% activity loss. this significant and construct-specific
inactivation indicated that ecps can assume a conformation
in which the engineered cysteinyl residues, p909c and
g919c, are proximate and can be induced to form a disulfide
bond. because the essential allosteric activator aga stabilizes the hcps conformation where the analogous disulfide
bond can be formed, we tested the effect of the positive allosteric effector ornithine on ecps behavior. however, the
addition of 10 mm ornithine to the pao incubation mixture
had essentially no effect on the pao response of wt or any
of the three mutants (data not shown). inactivation of
p909c/g919c by pao could be prevented by the inclusion
of atp in the reaction mixture (table 4), presumably
because binding of atp at the domain c active site sterically
blocks access to pao. when p909c/g919c that had been
40% inactivated by pao treatment was subsequently treated
with 10 mm dtt, 19% activity was recovered after 10 s of
treatment. the failure to observe further dtt reactivation
with treatment times up to 2 min suggested that the engineered disulfide bond was not fully accessible to reducing
agent.
ecps occurs almost entirely as a tetramer (four 42-kda subunits plus four 118-kda subunits; fig. 1) under both physiological conditions and the present experimental conditions (7, 30).
thus, it is feasible that the disulfide bond observed for p909c/
g919c was an intermolecular bond involving the p909c of one
monomer and the g919c of another. the intermolecular
bonding possibility was not a concern for the hcps studies
because that enzyme is known to exist as a monomer under the
experimental conditions utilized (31) and because earlier gel
analysis of the fsba-induced disulfide ruled out formation of
any species other than the monomer.3 to determine whether
the pao-induced disulfide bond of p909c/g919c was
intramolecular or intermolecular, we carried out non-reducing
sds-page analysis of pao-treated wt and mutant constructs. none of the pao treated ecpss, including the double
mutant, display shifts in mobility that would accompany introduction of an intermolecular disulfide bond (data not shown).
therefore, the engineered disulfide bond of p909c/g919c was
intramolecular.
implications for parallel conformational changes in ecps
and hcps—in sum, these findings indicated at least some conformational similarity between the aga䡠hcps complex and
ecps. additionally, the fact that the ␣ carbons of pro-909 and
gly-919 are 23.97 å apart, far from the average disulfide bond
length of 5.99 å, in the single solved conformation of ecps (fig.
3) indicated that the conformation with the engineered disulfide bond represents an alternative ecps conformation. pro909 and gly-919 occur near the boundary of domain c, one of
the duplicated atp grasp domains, and domain d, where allosteric effectors bind. as seen in fig. 3, pro-909 and gly-919 do
not occur within constrained secondary structural elements in
