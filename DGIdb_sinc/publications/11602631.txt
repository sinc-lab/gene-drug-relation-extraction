receptors for  xxxd1903xxx (2) that regulate cellular immune responses in the mouse.  production of  xxxd1903xxx (2) (pge(2)) is enhanced during inflammation, and this lipid mediator can dramatically modulate immune responses. there are four receptors for pge(2) (ep1- xxxg1875xxx ) with unique patterns of expression and different coupling to intracellular signaling pathways. to identify the ep receptors that regulate cellular immune responses, we used mouse lines in which the genes encoding each of the four ep receptors were disrupted by gene targeting. using the mixed lymphocyte response (mlr) as a model cellular immune response, we confirmed that pge(2) has potent antiproliferative effects on wild-type responder cells. the absence of either the ep1 or ep3 receptors did not alter the inhibitory response to pge(2) in the mlr. in contrast, when responder cells lacked the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor, pge(2) had little effect on proliferation. modest resistance to pge(2) was also observed in  xxxg1875xxx -/- responder cells. reconstitution experiments suggest that  xxxg1873xxx  receptors primarily inhibit the mlr through direct actions on t cells. furthermore, pge(2) modulates macrophage function by activating the  xxxg1875xxx  and thereby inhibiting cytokine release. thus, pge(2) regulates cellular immune responses through distinct ep receptors on different immune cell populations:  xxxg1873xxx  receptors directly inhibit t cell proliferation while  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors regulate antigen presenting cells functions.
