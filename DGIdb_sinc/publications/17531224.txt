abstract
in the present study, we investigated ischemia-induced changes of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate synthesizing enzyme and degrading enzyme and
neuroprotective effects and roles of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate against ischemic damage in the gerbil hippocampal ca1 region. pyridoxal 5′phosphate oxidase and  xxxg1721xxx  immunoreactivities were changed in neurons up to 2 days after ischemia, while 4 days
after ischemia their immunoreactivities were expressed in astrocytes. pyridoxal 5′-phosphate oxidase immunoreactivity and its protein level were
highest 12 h after ischemia, while those in  xxxg1721xxx  were highest 2 days after ischemia. total activities of these enzymes
were changed after ischemia, but specific activities of the enzymes were not altered. treatment with pyridoxal 5′-phosphate into brains (4 mug/5 mul,
i.c.v.) at 30 min before transient ischemia protected about 80% of ca1 pyramidal cells 4 days after ischemia and induced elevation of glutamic
acid decarboxylase 67 immunoreactivity in the ca1 region. however, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate treatment into ischemic brains decreased gaba
transaminase immunoreactivity in the ca1 region after ischemia. these results indicate that pyridoxal 5′-phosphate may be associated with the
inhibitory discharge of gaba in the hippocampal ca1 neurons, and the increased level of gaba may protect hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells
from ischemic damage.

introduction
gaba is a major neurotransmitter acting the inhibition of
neurons (cammalleri et al., 2002; gerstein et al., 2005; coimbra
et al., 2006). in nearly all brain regions, most gaba-containing
neurons are interneurons that participate in local circuits (jinno
and kosaka, 2002). in several instances, gabaergic interneurons are more resistant to cell damage as compared with
principal (glutamatergic) neurons (babcock et al., 2002). within
brain hippocampus, glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampal
ca1 region are vulnerable to ischemic damage because massive
calcium influx occurs in this region (jabaudon et al., 2000;
kelly et al., 2004a; gan et al., 2005). however, gabaergic

interneurons in the hippocampal ca1 region are relatively
resistant to cerebral ischemia (lust et al., 1988; johansen et al.,
1989; hwang et al., 2004a,b). gaba is synthesized by glutamic
acid decarboxylase (gad) and catabolized by  xxxg8xxx  ( xxxg8xxx ) (rothman and olney, 1986; tillakaratne et al.,
1995; kang et al., 2000). both the enzymes absolutely require
 xxxd3047xxx  (plp) as cofactor (chen et al., 2003).
therefore, a defective supplement of the coenzyme plp causes a
reduction of gaba concentration in whole brain and exhibits a
range of neurological symptoms, including tremors and seizures
(baxter, 2003).
the final step of  xxxd3049xxx  synthesis is the oxidation of
pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (pnp) to plp catalyzed by pnp oxidase
( xxxg1793xxx ); this reaction also serves as critical constituent in the
recycling of plp in mammals that require  xxxd3049xxx  (choi et al.,
1983; kelly et al., 2004b). kinetic constants for oxidative reaction

catalyzed by  xxxg1793xxx  are quite similar to the reaction catalyzed by
pnp and pyrixoxamine 5′-phosphate (pmp) (choi et al., 1987;
zhao and winkler, 1995). this suggests that plp in mammalian
enzyme is used only in the scavenger pathway. plp is a very
reactive molecule forming complexes with most small nucleophiles and proteins in cells, suggesting that free plp is maintained
at a very low level (zhao and winkler, 1995; dakshinamurti et al.,
2003). this would require  xxxg1793xxx  to be highly regulated in vivo so
that it produces plp only at the rate it is required (fu et al., 2001).
the preferred degradation route from plp to 4-pyridoxic acid
involves the dephosphorylation of plp by  xxxg1721xxx 
(plp-p) (lumeng and li, 1980) followed separately by the
actions of  xxxg168xxx  and beta-nicotinamide adenosine
dinucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase.
ischemic injury to neurons is primarily due to the interruption
of blood flow, lack of oxygenation, and subsequent reoxygenation after brain ischemia/reperfusion (sims and anderson, 2002;
hwang et al., 2004b, 2005). ischemia/reperfusion injury to the
brain is a major cause of neurologic abnormalities (meno et al.,
2003; li et al., 2004). in the present study, therefore, we
investigated chronological alterations in  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p immunoreactivity and their activities in order to determine the
relationship between the neuronal damage and finally examined
the neuroprotective effects and roles of plp in ischemic hippocampus induced by transient ischemia in gerbils.

the restoration of blood flow (reperfusion) was observed directly using the ophthalmoscope. we maintained the body (rectal)
temperature under free-regulating or normothermic (37 ± 0.5 °c)
conditions with a rectal temperature probe (tr-100; ysi, usa)
and a thermometric blanket before, during and after the surgery
until the animals completely recovered from anesthesia. shamoperated animals were subjected to the same surgical procedures
except that the common carotid arteries were not occluded.
normal animals served as controls.

materials and methods

at designated times (30 min, 3 h, 12 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days,
and 4 days after the surgery), sham-operated and operated (n = 7
at each time point) animals were sacrificed for this study (kang
et al., 2002a; hwang et al., 2004a, 2005). to obtain the exact
data for immunohistochemistry, free-floating sections from each
group were processed by immunohistochemistry under the
same conditions. the sections were sequentially treated with
0.3%  xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2) in pbs for 30 min and 10%
normal horse serum in 0.05 m pbs for 30 min. the sections
were incubated with diluted mouse anti- xxxg1793xxx  antibody
(diluted 1:50) (bahn et al., 2002; kang et al., 2002b) or diluted
mouse anti-plp-p (diluted 1:50) (jang et al., 2003) overnight at
room temperature. thereafter the sections were exposed to
biotinylated goat anti-mouse igg and streptavidin peroxidase
complex (vector, usa). the sections were visualized with 3,3′diaminobenzidine in 0.1 m tris–hcl buffer and mounted on the
gelatin-coated slides.
in order to establish the specificity of the immunostaining, a
negative control test was carried out by substituting normal
mouse serum for primary antibody or by omitting the primary
antibody. the negative control showed the absence of immunoreactivity in any structures.

experimental animals
this study utilized the progeny of mongolian gerbils
(meriones unguiculatus) obtained from the experimental
animal center, hallym university, chunchon, south korea.
male mongolian gerbils were used at 6 months of age. the
animals were housed in a temperature (23 °c)- and humidity
(60%)-controlled room with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and
provided with food and water ad libitum. procedures involving
animals and their care conformed with the institutional guidelines, which are in compliance with current international laws
and policies (nih guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals, nih publication no. 85-23, 1985, revised 1996) and
were approved by the hallym's medical center institutional
animal care and use committee. all experiments were conducted to minimize the number of animals used and suffering
caused.
induction of transient forebrain ischemia
male mongolian gerbils weighing 70–75 g (6 months of age)
were placed under general anesthesia with a mixture of 2.5%
isoflurane in 33% oxygen and 67% nitrous oxide. a midline
ventral incision was then made in the neck and both common
carotid arteries were isolated, freed of nerve fibers, and occluded
using non-traumatic aneurysm clips. the complete interruption
of blood flow was confirmed by observing the central artery in
retinae using an ophthalmoscope. after 5 min of occlusion, the
aneurysm clips were removed from the common carotid arteries.

tissue processing for histology
to obtain the exact data in this study, tissues of animals were
carefully processed under the same conditions. for histology, the
animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and
perfused transcardially with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs, ph 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m
phosphate buffer (pb, ph 7.4). the animals' brains were removed
and postfixed in the same fixative for 6 h. the brain tissues were
cryoprotected by infiltration with 30% sucrose overnight.
thereafter frozen tissues were serially sectioned transversely in
30 ìm thickness with a cryostat and then were collected into sixwell plates containing pbs.
immunohistochemistry

double immunohistochemistry
to confirm the neuronal type containing  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity, double immunofluorescence staining for the mouse antipnpo antiserum (1:15) and the rabbit anti- xxxg849xxx  (1:50,
chemicon, usa) was performed (hwang et al., 2004a). we
also performed the double immunostaining for mouse anti- xxxg1793xxx 
antiserum (1:15)/rabbit anti- xxxg883xxx  (gfap,

116

1:100, chemicon, usa) or mouse anti-plp-p antiserum (1:15)/
rabbit gfap for astrocytes detection. these sections were incubated in the mixture of antisera overnight at room temperature.
after washing three times for 10 min with pbs, the sections were
also incubated in a mixture of both cy3-conjugated goat antimouse igg (1:200, jackson immunoresearch, usa) and fitcconjugated goat anti-rabbit igg (1:600, jackson immunoresearch, usa) for 2 h at room temperature. the immunoreactions
were observed under the axioscope microscope attached
hbo100 (carl zeiss, germany).
western blot analysis
to confirm the changes in  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p level in the
hippocampal ca1 region after transient forebrain ischemia,

sham-operated (n = 5) and operated (n = 5 in each group) groups
at designated times (30 min, 3 h, 12 h, 2 days and 4 days after
the surgery) were used for western blot analysis. after sacrificing them and removing the hippocampus, it was serially and
transversely cut to 400 mum thickness on a vibratome (leica,
germany) and the hippocampal ca1 region was dissected with
a surgical blade. the tissues were homogenized in 50 mm pbs
(ph 7.4) containing egta (ph 8.0), 0.2% np-40, 10 mm
edta (ph 8.0), 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm betaglycerophosphate, 50 mm naf, 150 mm nacl, 2 mm sodium
orthvanadate, 1 mm pmsf and 1 mm dtt. after centrifugation, alpha-synuclein level was determined in supernatants using a
micro bca protein assay kit with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the
standard (pierce chemical, usa). aliquots containing 20 mug of
total protein were boiled in loading buffer containing 150 mm

tris (ph 6.8), 3 mm dtt, 6% sds, 0.3% bromophenol blue
and 30% glycerol. then, each aliquot was loaded onto a 10%
polyacryamide gel. after electrophoresis, the gels were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes (schleicher and schuell,
usa). to reduce background staining, the membranes were
incubated with 5% non fat dry milk in pbs containing 0.1%
tween 20 for 45 min with mouse anti- xxxg1793xxx  antiserum (1:100)
or mouse anti-plp-p antiserum (1:100), with peroxidase conjugated horse anti-mouse igg (sigma, usa) and then with an
ecl kit (amersham, usa).
enzymatic assay
seven animals in each group (the same animals in the western
blot analysis) were used in this enzymatic assay. the activity

117

of  xxxg1793xxx  was conducted according to a previously described
method (kang et al., 2002b). the enzymatic activity of plp-p
was measured at ph 7.4 in 40 mm triethanolamine–hcl. the
rate of production of pyridoxal from plp was measured by
following the decrease in absorbance at 388 nm for at least 3 min.
the initial velocity data were fitted by a least-squares method
to the lineweaver–burk transformation. a molecular weight
of 64,000 for  xxxg1721xxx  with a specific activity of
1.4 mumol·min− 1 mg− 1 was used in the calculation of molar
enzyme concentration. one unit of specific activity is defined as
the amount of protein that catalyzes the formation of pyridoxal/
min from plp. plp is known to have an extinction coefficient of
4900 cm− 1 m− 1 at ph 7.0. protein concentrations were determined by the bradford assay using the reagent and microprocedure
from pierce chemical co. bovine serum was used as a standard.

analysis of plp effects against ischemic damage
treatment with plp
to elucidate the protective effects of plp against ischemic
damage, animals (n = 7 in each group) were injected with vehicle
(physiological saline) or plp (4 mug/5 mul, i.c.v. for 15 min) at
30 min before transient ischemia, and thereafter plp was
injected every day. the animals were killed on the day 4 or 7
after the operation.
cresyl violet staining
to elucidate the effects of plp against ischemic damage,
cresyl violet staining in the hippocampal ca1 region was used
according to a previously described procedure (hwang et al.,
2005). in brief, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated microscopic slides. cresyl violet acetate (sigma, usa) was dissolved
at 1.0% (w/v) in distilled water, and glacial acetic acid was
added in this solution. before and after staining for 2 min at
room temperature, the sections were washed twice in distilled
water, dehydrated by placing successively for 2 h in 50%, 70%,
80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% ethanol baths at room temperature,
and finally mounted with canada balsam (kato, japan).
immunohistochemistry for  xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg8xxx 
to elucidate the protective mechanism of plp effect against
ischemic damage, we conducted immunohistochemical staining

for changes in  xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivities after
plp treatment into the ischemic hippocampal ca1 region according to the method which is mentioned above. in brief, the
sections were incubated with diluted mouse anti- xxxg849xxx  antibody (1:50, chemicon, usa) or diluted mouse anti- xxxg8xxx 
(diluted 1:50) overnight at room temperature. thereafter the
sections were exposed to biotinylated goat anti-mouse igg and
streptavidin peroxidase complex (vector, usa). the sections
were visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in 0.1 m  xxxd3449xxx 
and mounted on the gelatin-coated slides.
quantification of data and statistical analysis
all measurements were performed in order to ensure objectivity in blind conditions, by two observers for each experiment,
carrying out the measures of control and experimental samples
under the same conditions.
for the quantitative analysis of  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p immunoreactivity in the hippocampal ca1 region, 15 sections in each
animal were randomly selected within the gerbil hippocampal
ca1 region. the midpoint areas of the ca1 region were measured on the monitor at a magnification of 25–50×. images of all
 xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p immunoreactive structures taken from 3 layers
(strata oriens, pyramidale, and radiatum) were obtained through
an axiophot light microscope (carl zeiss, germany) equipped
with a ccd (charge coupled device) camera connected to a pc

levels in the ischemic ca1 region.  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p protein levels peak 12 h and 2 days after ischemia, respectively. differences among the means were statistically
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the duncan's new multiple range method or newman–keuls test (ap b 0.05, significant differences from the
sham-operated group, bp b 0.05, significant differences from pre-adjacent group). the bars indicate the means ± s.d.

monitor. video images were digitized into an array of 512 × 512
pixels corresponding to a tissue area of 140 × 140 mum (40×
primary magnification). each pixel resolution was 256 gray
levels. the intensity of all  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p immunoreactive
structures was evaluated by means of a relative optical density
(rod) value, which was obtained after transformation of mean
gray values using the formula: rod = log (256/mean gray
value). we measured the rod of the complete field, and the
values of background staining were subtracted from the rod
values of all immunoreactive structures before statistically processing. the relative percent of control levels was demonstrated
in the graph. the results of the western blot analysis were also
scanned, and rod was obtained using scion image software
(scion corp., usa).
for plp effect against ischemic damage after ischemic insult, measurement of neuronal number was performed using an
image analyzing system equipped with a computer-based ccd
camera (software: optimas 6.5, cybermetrics, usa). cresyl
violet-stained neurons were counted in a 250 × 250 mum square,
applied approximately at the center of the ca1 region in the
stratum pyramidale. cell counts were obtained by averaging the
counts from 25 sections taken from each animal. the number of

119

cresyl violet positive neurons was compared to that of the shamoperated group.
inter-animal differences in each group, as well as interexperimental differences, were not statistically significant. the
values shown here represent the means of experiments performed for each hippocampal area. differences among the
means were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance followed by the duncan's new multiple range method
or newman–keuls test to elucidate the ischemia-associated
changes of  xxxg1793xxx  or plp-p to investigate the differences between sham-operated and operated groups. p b 0.05 was considered significant.

immunoreactivity was changed slightly, but not significantly
(fig. 2).
in the sham-operated group,  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity was
weakly detected in pyramidal cells in the hippocampal ca1
region (fig. 1a). at 30 min after ischemic insult, strong  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactivity was expressed in non-pyramidal cells in the
ca1 region (fig. 1b). at this time after ischemia/reperfusion,
well-stained neuronal processes projected to the strata radiatum
and oriens. at 3 h after ischemia/reperfusion,  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity increased slightly in the ca1 region (figs. 1c and k).
in the 12 h post-ischemic group,  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity in the
ca1 region showed a different pattern (fig. 1d). in this group,
strong  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity was expressed in ca1 pyramidal cells of the stratum pyramidale. at this time after ischemia,
 xxxg1793xxx -immunoreactive non-pyramidal cells decreased in number as compared with the 3 h post-ischemic group. thereafter,
 xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity decreased in the ca1 region with time
(fig. 1k). three to four days after ischemic insult,  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactivity disappeared in neurons in the ca1 region
(fig. 1e). in this time period,  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity was
expressed in glial cells because delayed neuronal death
occurred in the ca1 pyramidal cells (fig. 1e) (kirino,
1982; petito and pulsinelli, 1984).
in the present study, the result of western blot analysis
showed that the pattern of  xxxg1793xxx  level in the hippocampus was
similar to immunohistochemical changes after 5 min of transient
forebrain ischemia (fig. 3).  xxxg1793xxx  protein level was highest at
12 h after ischemia, thereafter its level decreased by 2 days after
ischemia/reperfusion. however, 4 days after ischemic insult,
 xxxg1793xxx  protein level increased as compared with the 2 days postischemic group because  xxxg1793xxx  immunoreactivity increased
significantly in glial cells in the ca1 region (fig. 1e).

2 days after ischemia. four days after ischemia/reperfusion,
however, plp-p protein level decreased as compared with the
2 days post-ischemic group.

expression of  xxxg1793xxx  in  xxxg849xxx -immunoreactive neurons
at 30 min and 3 h after ischemia/reperfusion,  xxxg1793xxx 
immunoreactivity was detected in non-pyramidal cells in the
ca1 region (figs. 1b and c). based on double immunofluorescence staining, some  xxxg1793xxx -immunoreactive cells showed
 xxxg849xxx  immunoreactivity (gabaergic) (figs. 4a–c) (hwang
et al., 2004a).
expression of  xxxg1793xxx  or plp-p in gfap-immunoreactive
astrocytes after ischemia
four to five days after ischemic insult, most pyramidal cells
in the ca1 region were lost due to the delayed neuronal death

changes in plp-p
the plp-p immunoreactivity was also significantly changed
in the hippocampal ca1 region after transient forebrain ischemia, but in the hippocampal ca2 region plp-p immunoreactivity was changed slightly (figs. 1 and 2).
in the sham-operated group, plp-p immunoreactivity was
detected in pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells in the ca1 region
(fig. 1f). at 3 h after ischemia/reperfusion, plp-p immunoreactivity decreased significantly in the ca1 region (figs. 1g
and k). in the 12 h post-ischemic group, plp-p immunoreactivity in the ca1 region slightly increased compared to the 3 h
post-ischemic group (figs. 1h and k). thereafter, the immunoreactivity increased in the ca1 region time-dependently. two
days after ischemic insult, plp-p immunoreactivity significantly
increased in the ca1 pyramidal cells (figs. 1i and k). four days
after ischemic insult, plp-p immunoreactivity disappeared in
neurons of the ca1 region. at this time after ischemia, plp-p
immunoreactivity was expressed in glial components due to
the delayed neuronal death of ca1 pyramidal cells (figs. 1j
and k) (pekny and nilsson, 2005).
the result of western blot analysis for plp-p in the hippocampus was similar to immunohistochemical changes (fig. 3).
plp-p protein level was lowest at 3 h after ischemia, and highest

plp-p-immunoreactive glial cells were identified as gfapimmunoreactive astrocytes using a double immunofluorescence
staining (figs. 4d–i).
ischemia-induced changes in enzymes activities
the total activities of enzymes were changed after ischemic
insult, but the specific activities of enzymes were not altered
significantly (fig. 5). the total  xxxg1793xxx  activity (0.0027–
0.0031 unit/mg protein) significantly increased at 12 h after
ischemic insult and thereafter the total  xxxg1793xxx  activity
decreased time-dependently after ischemia (fig. 5a). on the
other hand, the total plp-p activity (0.0027–0.0031 unit/mg
protein) significantly increased 2 days after ischemic insult
(fig. 5b). thereafter the total plp-p activity decreased timedependently. however, the specific activity of  xxxg1793xxx  and  xxxg1721xxx  was not changed significantly in the ischemic hippocampus
(figs. 5a and b).

effects of plp against ischemic damage
protective effects on ischemic ca1 pyramidal cells
in the vehicle-treated group, the percentage of cresyl violet
positive cells in the ca1 region was 11.2% due to the delayed
neuronal death of pyramidal cells compared to that in the shamoperated group (figs. 6a and b) (kirino, 1982; petito and
pulsinelli, 1984). however, 77.9% of ca1 pyramidal cells in
the plp-treated group were stained with cresyl violet 4 days
after ischemic insult (figs. 6a and b). seven days after ischemic insult, the percentage of cresyl violet positive pyramidal
cells in the ca1 region was similar to that found 4 days after
ischemic insult (fig. 6b).
protective mechanisms of plp in ischemic neurons
in the vehicle-treated group,  xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivities significantly increased in ca1 pyramidal cells 1 day
after ischemic insult (figs. 7b and i). in this group,  xxxg849xxx  and
 xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivities were expressed in glial cells in the
ca1 region 4 days after ischemic insult (figs. 7c and j) (kang

respectively. in the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp)-treated groups,  xxxg849xxx  immunoreactivity increases in ca1 neurons in all the groups after ischemia compared to the
corresponding group (d–f).  xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivity increases in neurons 1 day after ischemia (i) and is expressed in glial cells 4 days after ischemia (j). in the

in the sham-operated and in the 1 day post-ischemic groups
compared to the corresponding vehicle-treated groups (figs. 7d
and e). however, in the plp-treated groups,  xxxg8xxx 
immunoreactivity slightly decreased in the sham-operated and
in the 1 day post-ischemic groups compared to the corresponding
vehicle-treated groups (figs. 7k and l). in the 4 days postischemic groups after plp treatment,  xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg8xxx 
immunoreactivities were not expressed in glial cells;  xxxg849xxx  and
 xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivities were shown in pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells in the ca1 region (figs. 7f and m).

discussion
the  xxxd3049xxx  group primarily consists of three interrelated
vitamers including pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. all
three pyrimidine derivatives are naturally existing forms of
 xxxd3049xxx  that are converted to plp in vivo (kelly et al., 2003).
plp, an active coenzyme form of  xxxd3049xxx , plays an important
role in the synthesis, catabolism, and interconversion of amino
acids and is also required for the biosynthesis of carbohydrates,
proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (huang et al., 2001; wang et al.,
2002). neurotransmitters such as gaba, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, as well as polyamines are synthesized by plp-

i.k. hwang et al. / experimental neurology 206 (2007) 114–125

dependent enzymes (wang et al., 2002). it is well known that some
vitamins and peptides have protective effects against ischemic
damage (huang et al., 2001; arvin et al., 2002; wang et al., 2002,
2005; kelly et al., 2003; pham et al., 2003; iwata et al., 2005).
in the present study, we observed that  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p
immunoreactivity and its protein level significantly increased in
the hippocampal ca1 region after ischemic insult. in a previous
study, we reported that  xxxg1720xxx , a plp synthesizing
enzyme, immunoreactivity and its protein level significantly
increase in the gerbil hippocampal ca1 region after transient
forebrain ischemia (hwang et al., 2004a). these results suggest
that plp synthesizing enzymes significantly increase in ischemic hippocampal ca1 region after ischemia and that these
increases are associated with the delayed neuronal death only in
ischemic ca1 pyramidal cells.
in this study,  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p were expressed in nonpyramidal gabaergic cells as well as pyramidal glutamatergic
cells in the ischemic ca1 region at early time after ischemia.
we reported that  xxxg849xxx  immunoreactivity increases significantly in the hippocampal ca1 region at an early time after
transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils (kang et al., 2002a).
these results indicate that the expression of  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p
in ca1 non-pyramidal cells at an early time after ischemia
may induce increase of gad in the ca1 non-pyramidal cells,
which plays an important role in delayed neuronal death via the
increase of gaba or enhancement of gaba shunt pathway
(kang et al., 2002b; hwang et al., 2004a). in addition, it is
reported that gabaergic neuronal discharge occurs after ischemia because  xxxg849xxx  plays a major role during tonic neuronal
activity (allgood et al., 1993; esclapez and houser, 1999).
four days after ischemic insult, most pyramidal cells in the
gerbil hippocampal ca1 region were lost due to the delayed
neuronal death (kirino, 1982; petito and pulsinelli, 1984). in
this study,  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p immunoreactivity was expressed
in glial components in the ca1 region 4 days after ischemic/
reperfusion. many  xxxg1793xxx - and plp-p-immunoreactive glial
cells were identified as gfap-immunoreactive astrocytes. this
result suggests that the increase of  xxxg1793xxx  and plp-p may
increase the activity or protein levels of  xxxg849xxx  in the hippocampal ca1 region (kang et al., 2002b). this increase of
 xxxg849xxx  may reduce the glutamate redistributed from neurons to
glia in the gerbil hippocampus (gajkowska et al., 1995). gaba
is synthesized from two gad isoforms,  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx .
 xxxg850xxx  is important for the local control of gaba synthesis at
the synaptic sites, and  xxxg849xxx  is responsible for maintaining
gaba baseline levels for both neurotransmitter and metabolite
(erlander et al., 1991; bu et al., 1992; feldblum et al., 1993;
esclapez et al., 1994; esclapez and houser, 1999; martin et al.,
2000; heldt et al., 2004). in a previous study, we observed the
spatial and temporal alterations of gad isoforms immunoreactivities in the gerbil hippocampus after 5 min of transient
forebrain ischemia (kang et al., 2002b).
the deficiency of  xxxd3049xxx  is known to cause nervousness,
depression, and peripheral and central neuropathy. geng groups
(geng et al., 1995) demonstrated that plp attenuates cellular
injury induced by glucose deprivation in cultured hippocampal
neurons. moreover, yamashima groups (yamashima et al.,

123

2001) examined that plp showed neuroprotective effects
against neuronal injury in the hippocampal ca1 region after
ischemia in monkeys. recently, kandzari et al. (2005) reported
that mc-1, an analogue of plp, is a novel therapeutic application
to reduce ischemic injury in heart. in addition, wang et al. (2005)
also demonstrated that mc-1 has a protective effect against focal
embolic stroke and mc-1 administration is delayed up to 6 h
after ischemic injury. however, these studies did not investigate
the correlation between plp and gaba after transient forebrain
ischemia although plp is a cofactor of gad.
in this study, we injected plp into the lateral cerebral ventricle
after ischemic insult. the injection of plp protected significantly
ca1 pyramidal neurons from ischemic damage. in addition, we
examined that the injection of plp elevated  xxxg849xxx  immunoreactivity in the ischemic ca1 region and that the injection of plp
reduced  xxxg8xxx  immunoreactivity in the ca1 region after
ischemia. our morphological data indicate that the injection of
plp may be associated with the inhibitory discharge of gaba in
the hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells and that an increase of
gaba in ischemic ca1 region may protect hippocampal ca1
pyramidal cells from an ischemic damage.
plp is a cofactor required in many cellular enzymes, especially in the amino acid metabolism. this cofactor plays a very
important role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters (lumeng and
li, 1980; chen et al., 2003) and the modulation of steroid–
receptor interaction (allgood et al., 1993). on the basis of plp
concentration ratios,  xxxg850xxx  makes up the majority of the
inactive apogad reservoir in gabaergic neurons, in contrast,
 xxxg849xxx  is nearly saturated with plp as a holoenzyme (martin
et al., 2000). in brief, our results suggest that plp synthesizing
enzymes alters in hippocampal ca1 region induced by transient
ischemia and that plp may be associated with the inhibitory
discharge of gaba in the hippocampal ca1 neurons, and the
increased level of gaba may protect hippocampal ca1
pyramidal cells from ischemic damage.
