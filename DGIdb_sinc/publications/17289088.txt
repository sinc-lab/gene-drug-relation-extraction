abstract`
lymphocytes possess the essential components of a cholinergic system, including acetylcholine (ach);  xxxg440xxx  (chat), its
synthesizing enzyme; and both muscarinic and nicotinic ach receptors (machrs and nachrs, respectively). stimulation of lymphocytes with
phytohemagglutinin, which activates t cells via the t cell receptor/cd3 complex, enhances the synthesis and release of ach and up-regulates
expression of chat and m5 machr mrnas. in addition, activation of protein kinase c and increases in intracellular camp also enhance
cholinergic activity in t cells, and lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (lfa-1;  xxxg1205xxx / xxxg1209xxx ) is an important mediator of leukocyte
migration and t cell activation. anti- xxxg1205xxx  monoclonal antibody (mab) as well as antithymocyte globulin containing antibodies against cd2,
cd7 and  xxxg1205xxx  all increase chat activity, ach synthesis and release, and expression of chat and m5 machr mrnas in t cells. the
cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits lfa-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on  xxxg1205xxx  ( xxxg1205xxx  chain), which leads to
immunomodulation. we found that simvastatin abolishes anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner
independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. collectively then, these results indicate that lfa-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic
cholinergic activity via  xxxg1205xxx -mediated pathways and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of
lymphocytic cholinergic activity.

introduction
lymphocytes possess the necessary cholinergic components
to constitute an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system:
t cells contain acetylcholine (ach) in physiologically relevant
concentrations and express  xxxg440xxx  (chat), an
ach-synthesizing enzyme, while both t and b cells express
muscarinic and nicotinic ach receptors (machrs and
nachrs, respectively) and acetylcholinesterase (ache) (see
reviews by kawashima and fujii, 2000, 2003, 2004).

regulates c-fos expression, suggesting t cells can be activated
via machr-mediated pathways (fujii and kawashima, 2000;
kawashima and fujii, 2000). in addition, stimulation of
nachrs on t and b cells using nicotine elicits rapid and
transient increases in [ca2+]i (kawashima and fujii, 2003).
ach released from t cells thus would be expected to have the
ability to modify the functions of t and b cells and antigen
presenting cells (apcs) by acting via machrs and nachrs in
autocrine and paracrine fashions, and it would be of interest to
know how ach production in t cells is regulated during
immunological stimulation. this review focuses primarily on 1)
the factors that modulate lymphocytic cholinergic activity; 2)
the activation of the lymphocytic cholinergic system via cell
surface molecules and 3) the inhibitory effects of simvastatin on
anti- xxxg1205xxx  monoclonal antibody (mab)-induced lymphocytic
cholinergic activation.

factors modulating cholinergic activity in t cells
several mediators of t cell activation have been found to
enhance lymphocytic cholinergic activity by facilitating
synthesis and release of ach through up-regulation of chat
mrna expression (table 1).
phytohemagglutinin (pha)
activation of t cells by pha involves stimulation of
phospholipase c (plc)-mediated production of inositol-1, 4, 5trisphosphate and protein kinase c (pkc) via the t cell receptor
(tcr)/cd3 molecule complex. stimulation of molt-3 human
leukemic t cells using pha increases both the level of
intracellular ach and its release (fujii et al., 1996). in addition,
these effects of pha, along with up-regulation of chat mrna,
have been confirmed in human mononuclear leukocytes
(mnls) (fujii et al., 1998) and rat t cells (rinner et al.,
1998). the increases in cellular ach content and release
exhibited by activated t-lymphocytes thus appear to be
mediated, at least in part, by increased synthesis of chat.
pha also stimulates expression of both machrs and ache
(szelenyi et al., 1987; paldi-haris et al., 1990). incubating
ccrf-cem human leukemic t cells in the presence of pha
strongly up-regulates expression of m5 machr mrna. this
effect is suppressed by  xxxd1169xxx , a mitogen-activated protein
kinase (mapk) kinase inhibitor, which suggests that pha upregulates m5 machr gene expression at least in part via pkc
and mapk pathways, perhaps by modulating the activity of the
 xxxg1222xxx . finally, pha enhances expression of
c-fos mrna, a marker of cell activation, and this effect, too, is
inhibited by  xxxd1169xxx  (fujii et al., 2003).
dibutyryl  xxxd1773xxx  (dbcamp)
treating ng108-15 cholinergic neuronal cells with camp
leads to increases in chat mrna expression and activity
(misawa et al., 1993). in molt-3 cells, activation by the
selective agonist ono-4819 of the prostaglandin  xxxg1875xxx  receptor,
which is positively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase system,
enhances expression of chat mrna and increases ach
synthesis (suenaga et al., 2004). conversely, activation by the
immunologically active peptide  xxxg172xxx  of the apj receptor, a
member of the seven-transmembrane-domain receptor superfamily, which is negatively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase

system, inhibits chat mrna expression and reduces ach
synthesis as well as expression of interleukin-2 mrna
(horiuchi et al., 2003).
the camp analogue dbcamp up-regulates chat mrna
expression and enhances pha-induced chat mrna expression in molt-3 cells. although dbcamp, itself, causes only a
small and insignificant increase of chat activity, dbcamp in
combination with pha significantly enhanced increases in
intracellular ach content (fujii and kawashima, 2003), which
suggests that the adenylyl cyclase system is involved in
regulating lymphocytic cholinergic activity in t cells.
 xxxd2925xxx 
activation of pkc by phorbol  xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma)
increases the numbers of chat-positive cells in primary
cultures of basal forebrain neurons (alderson et al., 1989).
incubating molt-3 cells for 24 h in the presence of pma also
significantly increases chat activity in a concentration
dependent manner, and the pma-induced activation of chat
is blocked by  xxxd2195xxx , a specific pkc inhibitor
(masuyama et al., 2005). this suggests that, in addition to the
adenylyl cyclase system, pkc pathways are directly involved in
regulating lymphocytic cholinergic activity.
modulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity by stimulation
of cell surface molecules
stimulation of t and b cells using their respective activators
or cell surface molecules leads to up-regulation of ach
synthesis and m5 machr expression (kawashima and fujii,
2004). immunological activation of lymphocytes in vivo thus
appears to enhance cholinergic signal transmission between t
cells and target cells, including b cells and apcs, by enhancing
synthesis and release of ach by t cells and expression of m5
machr on both t and b cells.
rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin-fresenius (atg-f) is
an immunosuppressive (remberger et al., 1999) that acts via
cell surface molecules cd2, cd7 and  xxxg1205xxx , also known as
lymphocyte function-associated antigen-2, one of the earliest
antigens of the t-cell lineage and lymphocyte functionassociated antigen-1 (lfa-1) alpha-chain, respectively. atg-f
enhances ach release from ccrf-cem cells, which leads to
reductions in intracellular ach levels. within 48 h, however,
the ach content of the cells recovers due to up-regulation of
chat expression. atg-f stimulation also increases expression
of m5 machr mrna.
the effects on lymphocytic cholinergic activity of the interaction of t cell surface molecules such as lfa-1 with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) on apcs are not yet
completely understood. stimulation of these cell surface molecules using the appropriate mabs activates intracellular signaling pathways leading to increases in [ca2+]i and modulation
of lymphocyte function (ledbetter et al., 1987). as mentioned
above, atg-f enhanced ach release from ccrf-cem cells
already after 6 h of exposure by causing [ca2+]i transients
mediated via cd7, which led to declines in intracellular ach

2322

content. within 48 h, however, the ach content was elevated,
as compared to the control, due to up-regulation of chat
expression mediated by  xxxg1205xxx  (fujii et al., 2002). we suggest,
therefore, that stimulation of  xxxg1205xxx  induces activation of the
lymphocytic cholinergic system.
effects of simvastatin on anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced
activation of cholinergic activity in t cells
statins are commonly used cholesterol-lowering drugs that
inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa)
reductase. in addition to their hypocholesterolemic effects,
statins also exert immunomodulatory effects; for instance, they
reduce the incidence of chronic rejection in cardiac (kobashigawa et al., 1995) and renal transplant recipients (wanner
et al., 2000). moreover, simvastatin is a promising candidate for
use in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (neuhaus et al., 2004).
while the mechanisms involved in the immunomodulatory
effects of statins are not yet fully understood, it is known that
statins selectively inhibit lfa-1-mediated adhesion and
costimulation of lymphocytes in a manner independent of
their inhibition of  xxxg1060xxx  activity (weitz-schmidt
et al., 2001). with that as background, and knowing the effects
of anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on lymphocytic cholinergic activity (fujii
et al., 2002), we examined the effects of simvastatin (1 mum) by
adding it to molt-3 cell cultures, with and without anti- xxxg1205xxx 
mab. after incubating the cells for 48 h, samples of the cells
and the conditioned media were collected for ach assay.
effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on proliferation
we found that, alone, neither simvastatin nor anti- xxxg1205xxx 
mab significantly affected the proliferation of molt-3 cells.
however, the combination of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
tended to inhibit cell proliferation, as compared to anti- xxxg1205xxx 
mab alone, but the effect was not statistically significant.

effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on ach content
and release
as shown in fig. 1a and b, anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab significantly
(p b 0.01) increased both the ach content of molt-3 cells and
its release into the culture medium, whereas simvastatin had no
effect on ach content or its release. on the other hand,
simvastatin completely blocked the increases in ach content
and release elicited by anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab.
effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on chat and
machr mrna expression
anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab also significantly (p b 0.05) up-regulated
expression of chat mrna (fig. 2a, compare lanes 1 and 3;
fig. 2b), whereas simvastatin had no effect on expression of
chat mrna (fig. 2a, compare lanes 1 and 2; fig. 2b) (fujii
et al., 2006). when added to cultures along with anti- xxxg1205xxx 
mab, however, simvastatin completely blocked anti- xxxg1205xxx 
mab-induced chat transcription (fig. 2a, compare lanes 3
and 4; fig. 2b). likewise, simvastatin significantly (p b 0.01)
diminished anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced expression of m5
machr mrna (fig. 2a and b). neither simvastatin nor
anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab had any effect on expression of m3 or m4
machr mrna (data not shown).
effects of simvastatin and anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab on chat activity
consistent with their effects on chat expression and ach
content and release (figs. 1 and 2a), anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab
significantly enhanced chat-catalyzed ach synthesis in
molt-3 cells (fig. 2d), while simvastatin had no effect on
basal chat activity but abolished the anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced
enhancement of that activity.
it has been suggested that simvastatin and statin derivatives
could serve as useful immunosuppressive agents (neuhaus

et al., 2004). the results of our study (fujii et al., 2006)
demonstrate for the first time that simvastatin inhibits anticd11a mab-induced increases of ach synthesis and release, as
well as expression of chat and m5 machr mrna in a t cell
model (molt-3 cells). given that these effects were not
reversed by mevalolactone, we suggest that simvastatin
antagonizes the anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab-induced facilitation of
lymphocytic cholinergic activity via pathways other than the
inhibition of mevalonate synthesis. consistent with that idea,
weitz-schmidt et al. (2001) showed that statins block the
binding of laf-1 to icam-1, suggesting they exert immunomodulatory effects in part by inhibiting the interaction of t cells
with apcs. it thus seems likely that the inhibition of
lymphocytic cholinergic activity by simvastatin observed
under our experimental conditions is related, at least in part,
to its immunomodulatory effects, as the interaction of t cells
with apcs facilitates lymphocytic cholinergic transmission via
 xxxg1205xxx -mediated pathways.
surface immunoglobulin on b cells
the b cell activator staphylococcus aureus cowan i (sac)
binds to cell surface immunoglobulin, thereby initiating a signal
transduction cascade involving  xxxg2198xxx -mediated activation of plc, which in turn activates pkc and promotes b cell
proliferation. sac also up-regulates expression of m5 machr
mrna in daudi human leukemic b cells, but has no effect on
expression of m3 or m4 machr mrna (fujii et al., 2003).
pma together with  xxxd2379xxx  also up-regulates m5 machr
expression in daudi cells, suggesting that, as in t cells, pkc is
involved in stimulus-evoked up-regulation of m5 machr
expression in b cells. whether b cells are involved in the
regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity was investigated
by fujii et al. (2003) using a human circulating mnls con-

sisting mainly of t and b cells and a small number of monocytes. they found that incubating mnls with sac for 48 h
significantly increased their ach content and up-regulated
chat expression. given that  xxxg1164xxx , a cytokine
produced by b cells, is thought to provide help for t cells,
these data collectively suggest that cytokines released from
activated b cells act on t cells to stimulate chat expression and
ach synthesis, which in turn activates lymphocytic cholinergic
transmission via m5 machr-mediated pathways in both t and
b cells.
conclusion
upon interacting with apcs via tcr/cd3 and cd4 or
cd8, t cells show increased synthesis and release of ach,
which in turn acts via machrs and nachrs to activate t and b
cells or apcs (see reviews by kawashima and fujii, 2000,
2003, 2004). stimulation of  xxxg1205xxx  ( xxxg1205xxx  chain) by anticd11a mab up-regulates the expression of m5 machr and
chat, the latter leading to an enhanced ach synthesis and
chat activity (fujii et al., 2002, 2006). this suggests that the
interaction of t cells with apcs, vascular endothelial cells or
keratinocytes via lfa-1 and icam-1 enhances lymphocytic
cholinergic transmission (fujii et al., 2002; kawashima and
fujii, 2004; kurzen et al., in press). simvastatin and other statin
derivatives reportedly modulate immune function by inhibiting
lfa-1-mediated adhesion and costimulation of lymphocytes
(weitz-schmidt et al., 2001). furthermore, simvastatin
abolishes the enhancement of ach synthesis and release
induced by anti- xxxg1205xxx  mab via up-regulation of chat
expression (fujii et al., 2006), which suggests that the
immunosuppressive effect of simvastatin is related, at least in
part, to the inhibition of lymphocytic cholinergic activity
induced by stimulation of lfa-1.
