abstract
 xxxd2947xxx , an antagonist of structurally-rated gabaa receptors (gabaars) and glycine receptors ( xxxg863xxx ), is an equimolar mixture of picrotoxinin (ptxinin) and  xxxd2946xxx  (ptn).
these compounds share a common structure except that ptn
contains a slightly larger dimethylmethanol in place of the
ptxinin isopropenyl group. although the homomeric a1 glyr
is equally sensitive to both compounds, we show here that
homomeric a2 and a3  xxxg863xxx , like most gabaars, are
selectively inhibited by ptxinin. as conservative mutations to
pore-lining 6¢ threonines equally affect the sensitivity of the a1
glyr to both compounds, we conclude that ptxinin and ptn
bind to 6¢ threonines by hydrogen bonding with exocyclic

oxygens common to both molecules. in contrast, substitution
of the 2¢ pore-lining glycine by serine selectively reduces ptn
sensitivity, whereas the introduction of 2¢ alanines selectively
increases ptxinin sensitivity. these results define the orientation of ptxinin and ptn binding in the a1 glyr pore and
allow us to conclude that the relatively reduced sensitivity of
ptn at gabaars and a2 and a3  xxxg863xxx  is due predominantly
to its larger size and reduced ability to form hydrophobic
interactions with 2¢ alanines.

 xxxg904xxx  (glyr) and gabaa receptor (gabaar)
chloride channels mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in
the central nervous system. both are members of the
pentameric cys-loop receptor family that includes the  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) as its most studied
member (unwin 2005). the plant alkaloid convulsant,
 xxxd2947xxx  (ptx), potently inhibits both the glyr and
gabaar. as ptx preferentially inhibits gabaars in
vivo, it is often used for selectively inhibiting gabaergic
synaptic currents. ptx also inhibits a homomeric  xxxg863xxx 
with a relatively high potency, although ab heteromeric
 xxxg863xxx  are ptx-resistant (pribilla et al. 1992). using chimeras of a1 and b glyr subunits, pribilla et al. delimited the
ptx sensitive region to the second membrane-spanning
(m2) domain (pribilla et al. 1992). the channel-lining 2¢ and
6¢ residues of the glyr and gabaar were subsequently
identiﬁed as speciﬁc determinants of ptx sensitivity
(ffrench-constant et al. 1993; zhang et al. 1994; gurley
et al. 1995; wang et al. 1995; xu and akabas 1996; shan
et al. 2001). it thus became widely hypothesized that ptx
binds in the pore. however, a simple pore-blocking mode of
action was not simple to reconcile with several observations.
first, ptx did not behave as a classical glyr pore-blocker:
its inhibitory potency decreased as glycine concentration
increased, and it displayed no use-dependence (lynch et al.
1995). moreover, several lines of evidence suggested that
ptx inhibition was mediated by an allosteric inhibitory
mechanism rather than by direct channel block (newland and

cull-candy 1992; lynch et al. 1995; chang and weiss 2002;
dibas et al. 2002; hawthorne and lynch 2005; wang et al.
2006). nevertheless, recent evidence has strengthened the
case for ptx binding in the pore. perhaps the strongest
evidence for the observation that ptx is trapped in the closed
state in both the a1r19¢c glyr (hawthorne and lynch 2005)
and the a2 glyr (wang et al. 2006). in addition, molecular
docking studies on homomeric a1  xxxg863xxx , q1 gabaars and
b3 gabaars have produced a consensus model for ptx
coordination by the 2¢ and 6¢ pore-lining residues (zhorov
and bregestovski 2000; chen et al. 2006). however, this
model is yet to be experimentally veriﬁed.
ptx is an equimolar mixture of picrotoxinin (ptxinin)
and  xxxd2946xxx  (ptn). although the structures of these
compounds differ only by single water group (fig. 1),
ptxinin is much more potent more than ptn at inhibiting
gabaars (jarboe et al. 1968). on the other hand, both
compounds are equally potent inhibitors of a1  xxxg863xxx  (lynch
et al. 1995). our aim is to investigate the effects of

conservative mutations to 2¢ and 6¢ residues on glyr
sensitivity to ptxinin and ptn in an attempt to understand
their binding mechanisms. we show here that conservative 2¢
mutations induce the glyr to discriminate strongly between
these compounds, whereas 6¢ mutations have similar effects
on receptor sensitivity to both compounds. this provides
strong evidence that the isopropenyl group unique to
ptxinin interacts closely with the 2¢ glyr side chain,
and allows us to infer how gabaars differentiate between
ptxinin and ptn. we also investigated whether these
compounds may be useful as probes for pharmacologically
discriminating between currents mediated by a1b and a3b
 xxxg863xxx  at inhibitory synapses on pain sensory neurons.
materials and methods
mutagenesis and expression of glyr cdnas
the human glyr a1 subunit cdna was subcloned into the pcis2
plasmid vector. the human a2 subunit, which was kindly provided
by dr paul groot-kormelink (university college, london, uk),
was subcloned into the pcdna3.1 plasmid vector (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca, usa). the rat a3 subunit was also subcloned into the
pcdna3.1 plasmid vector. the human b subunit was subcloned into
the pires2-egfp plasmid vector (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa).
site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the quickchange
mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa) and the successful
incorporation of mutations was conﬁrmed by sequencing the clones.
the only exception was the a1 g2¢s mutant glyr, which was kindly
provided by dr. malcolm slaughter (university of buffalo, ny,

electrophysiology
cells were visualized using an inverted ﬂuorescent microscope and
currents were measured by whole cell patch-clamp recording. cells
were perfused by a control solution that contained (in mmol/l): 140
nacl, 5 kcl, 2 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 10 hepes, 10 glucose, with the ph
adjusted to 7.4 with naoh. patch pipettes were fabricated from
borosilicate hematocrit tubing (vitrex, modulohm, denmark) and
heat polished. pipettes had a tip resistance of 1–2 mw when ﬁlled
with the standard pipette solution which contained (in mmol/l): 145
cscl, 2 cacl2, 2 mgcl2, 10 hepes, 10 egta, with the ph
adjusted to 7.4 with naoh. after establishment of the whole cell
conﬁguration, cells were voltage-clamped at )40 mv (unless
otherwise indicated) and membrane currents were recorded using
an axopatch 1d ampliﬁer and pclamp9 software (axon instruments, union city, ca, usa). the cells were perfused by a parallel
array of microtubular barrels through which solutions were gravityinduced. all experiments were conducted at room temperature (19–
22c).
because a homomers can form functional  xxxg863xxx , it is necessary
to conﬁrm the incorporation of b subunits into functional ab
heteromers. as the glyr b subunit cdna was cloned into the
pires2-egfp plasmid vector, we used green ﬂuorescent protein
ﬂuorescence to identify cells expressing the glyr b subunit. the
successful incorporation of b subunits into functional heteromeric
 xxxg863xxx  was inferred by characteristic changes in sensitivity to
ptxinin and ptn as described below. ptxinin and ptn were
obtained from sigma (st louis, mo, usa) and were stored frozen
as a 100 mmol/l stocks in dimethylsulfoxide.
data analysis
results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean of three
or more independent experiments. the hill equation was used to
calculate the saturating current magnitude (imax), half-maximal
concentration (ec50) and hill coefﬁcient (nh) values for glycine
activation. a similar equation was also used to calculate the half
maximal concentrations for inhibition (ic50) and nh values of the
antagonists tested in this study. all curves were ﬁtted using a nonlinear least squares algorithm (sigmaplot 9.0; jandel scientiﬁc, san
rafael, ca, usa). statistical signiﬁcance was determined by paired
or unpaired student’s t-test, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 representing signiﬁcance.
molecular modeling
a pentameric model of the region from )2¢ to 19¢ of m2 of the glyr
a1 subunit was built as described previously (hawthorne et al.
2006), by homology with the equivalent region of the nachr a
subunit in the electron microscopy-derived closed-channel structure,
(pdb code 1oed) (miyazawa et al. 2003). autodock 3.0 (morris
et al. 1998) was used to explore the possible interactions of
ptxinin and ptn with the central pore region of the model. the

this study investigated a range of wild type and mutated a
homomeric and ab heteromeric  xxxg863xxx . figure 2a shows
examples of whole cell currents activated by different glycine
concentrations from cells expressing the indicated wild type
and mutated  xxxg863xxx . figure 2b plots the averaged doseresponse relationships for the wild type homomeric a1, a2
and a3  xxxg863xxx  and the wild type heteromeric a1b and a3b
 xxxg863xxx . in this and all subsequent ﬁgures showing doseresponse curves, the continuous lines represent ﬁts of the hill
equation to the averaged dose-response relations. the
averaged ec50 and nh values, determined by averaging the
parameters determined from curve ﬁts to individual doseresponses, are shown in table 1. the ec50 values are similar
to those measured previously at these receptors (handford
et al. 1996; shan et al. 2001; miller et al. 2004), except for
those of the a3 and a3b  xxxg863xxx  which are several fold higher
than previously reported (meier et al. 2005; miller et al.
2005). the reasons for this are unknown. the averaged

the t6¢ residue is highly conserved among anionic cys-loop
subunits (fig. 3). indeed, a ring of ﬁve t6¢ residues has been
shown to be essential for high afﬁnity ptxinin inhibition
(gurley et al. 1995; shan et al. 2001, 2002; sedelnikova
et al. 2006). molecular modeling studies on homomeric a1
 xxxg863xxx , q1 gabaars and b3 gabaars predict that t6¢
hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with oxygens common to both ptxinin and ptn (zhorov and bregestovski
2000; chen et al. 2006). because the earlier modeling of the
interaction between ptxinin and the glyr pore (zhorov
and bregestovski 2000) was performed prior to the determination of the nachr pore structure at 4 å resolution
(miyazawa et al. 2003; unwin 2005), we have re-investigated this interaction using a model homomeric a1 glyr
pore based on this new structural template. the model was
generated as described above and computational docking was
used to assess feasible binding sites for ptxinin and ptn
within the pore lumen. the vast majority of the docked
conformations for ptxinin were in contact with t6¢

residues, including a major cluster within 1.5 å root-meansquared deviation comprising 40% of the total. for all docks
within this cluster, there were two or three hydrogen bonds
between t6¢ residues and the exocyclic oxygens common to
ptxinin and ptn, whereas the isopropenyl group of
ptxinin, the point of variation with ptn, was in closer
proximity to the g2¢ residues (fig. 3b, left). both of these
features are consistent with ptxinin docking in the b3
gabaar homomer (chen et al. 2006) and broadly consistent with the earlier glyr study (zhorov and bregestovski
2000). computational docking of ptn within our model
glyr pore showed a greater variety of conformations,
apparently due to the additional hydrogen bonding capacity
of its unique dimethyl-methanol group. nevertheless, a
signiﬁcant cluster overlapped closely with the major ptxinin cluster, with similar hydrogen bonds and the dimethylmethanol group positioned close to the g2¢ residues (fig. 3b,
right).
if this model is correct, then 6¢ mutations should equally
affect glyr sensitivity to ptxinin and ptn. to test this
hypothesis, we compared the ic50 values of ptxinin and
ptn at the a1t6¢f, a1t6¢s, a1t6¢a and a1t6¢v  xxxg863xxx . the
t6¢f mutation (the a to b subunit substitution) was tested as
it is known to cause a signiﬁcant reduction in ptx sensitivity
but does not abolish it completely (shan et al. 2001;
sedelnikova et al. 2006). we also tested the t6¢a and
t6¢s mutations, which are more conservative substitutions
for threonine residues. the t6¢a substitution removes the
hydroxyl group (thereby the hydrogen bond donor) of the
threonine side chain, whereas the t6¢s mutation speciﬁcally
eliminates the methyl group. finally, we investigated the
t6¢v mutation. this replaces the threonine hydroxyl group
with a non-polar methyl group.
in all experiments, the ptxinin and ptn inhibitory
dose-response relationships were measured at the glycine
ec50 value as listed in table 2. examples of the effects of
increasing concentrations of ptxinin and ptn on a1
glyr currents, together with averaged inhibitory doseresponse relationships, are shown in fig. 4a. the averaged
parameters of best ﬁt summarized in table 2. this result
conﬁrms the previous ﬁnding (lynch et al. 1995) that a1
 xxxg863xxx  are equally sensitive to both compounds. the
corresponding results for the a1t6¢f glyr, shown in
fig. 4b, reveal a signiﬁcantly decreased receptor sensitivity
to both ptxinin and ptn, although the a1t6¢f glyr
remained equally sensitive to both compounds. although
full dose-responses could not be generated due to its low
sensitivity to both compounds, we found that 100 lmol/l
ptxinin and ptn reduced a1t6¢f glyr current by
30 ± 5% and 35 ± 7% (n = 5 for each), respectively. the
t6¢a, t6¢s and t6¢v mutations completely eliminated
glyr sensitivity to both ptxinin and ptn (fig. 4b,
table 2). as all three mutations are conservative substitutions, their effects on ptxinin and ptn sensitivity are

presumably reasonably speciﬁc in disrupting the hydrogen
bonding and hydrophobic interaction capabilities of t6¢ side
chains. the ﬁnding that the t6¢v and t6¢s mutations both
eliminated sensitivity to ptxinin and ptn implies that
both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are
important determinants of their sensitivity. the predicted
roles of t6¢ side chains in coordinating ptxinin and ptn
are considered further in the discussion. overall, the results
so far provide strong evidence that the glyr t6¢ side chains
coordinate ptxinin and ptn via molecular groups
common to both molecules.

ptxinin and ptn sensitivity of  xxxg863xxx  mutated at the
2¢ position
despite their similar structures, ptxinin is much more potent
than ptn at inhibiting gabaars in vivo (jarboe et al. 1968).
consistent with earlier studies of  xxxg863xxx  and gabaars
(zhorov and bregestovski 2000; chen et al. 2006), our
modeling studies predict that the non-conserved groups of
ptxinin and ptn come into close contact with the glyr 2¢
residues (fig. 3b). gabaars usually have alanines, valines
or serines at the 2¢ position, which are all larger than the 2¢
glycine of the a1glyr (fig. 3). one modeling study predicted

that the 2¢ alanine methyl group of homomeric b3 gabaars
forms hydrophobic interactions with the isopropenyl group of
ptxinin (chen et al. 2006). such interactions are likely to be
less favorable with the more hydrophilic dimethyl-methanol
group of ptn. the small 2¢ glycine of the a1glyr would
eliminate such interactions, but may permit backbone groups
to contribute to hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions in
a manner that permits energetically equivalent interactions
with both blockers (zhorov and bregestovski 2000). an
alternate or additional possibility is that the small glycine side
chain enables both molecules to sterically ﬁt equally well at
this level of the pore. based on all these considerations, we
hypothesized that the g2¢a substitution in the a1 glyr should
result in an increased sensitivity to ptxinin and a decreased
sensitivity to ptn.
the amino acid sequences of a1 and a2 glyr m2 domains
are identical with the exception of a g2¢a substitution in the
a2 subunit (fig. 3). as shown in fig. 5a, the a2 glyr
indeed exhibited a remarkably increased sensitivity to
ptxinin and a modestly reduced sensitivity to ptn
(table 2). as expected, the ptxinin and ptn sensitivities
of the a1g2¢a glyr were similar to those of the a2 glyr
(fig. 5b, table 2). thus, the differential sensitivity of the a1
and a2  xxxg863xxx  is due to the amino acid difference at the 2¢
position. this conﬁrms the model predictions that the 2¢
residue is important for distinguishing between these two
molecules.

in an attempt to discern the molecular basis by which this
discrimination occurs, we investigated the ptxinin and ptn
sensitivities of the a1g2¢s glyr. serine is larger and more
hydrophilic than alanine. if side chain volume dominates the
process by which the a1g2¢a glyr distinguishes ptxinin
from ptn, then the a1g2¢s glyr should be more sensitive to
ptxinin than ptn. if side chain polarity dominates the
selectivity process, however, then the a1g2¢s glyr should be
more sensitive to the more polar ptn than to ptxinin. as
shown in fig. 5c and summarized in table 2, ptxinin
remains much more potent than ptn as an inhibitor of the
a1g2¢s glyr. this suggests that the space available at the 2¢
region is more important than 2¢ binding interactions in
discriminating between ptxinin and ptn. however, the
increased ptxinin sensitivity of the a1g2¢a glyr relative to
the a1 glyr implies that hydrophobic interactions improve the
binding of ptxinin to receptors containing 2¢ alanines.
role of the b subunit
the glyr b subunit shares an unusually low amino acid
homology with the m2 domains of all other anionic cys-loop
receptor subunits (fig. 3). of particular relevance to the
present study, this subunit contains non-conserved proline
and phenylalanine groups at the 2¢ and 6¢ positions,
respectively. heteromeric ab  xxxg863xxx  are believed to exist in
a 2a : 3b stoichiometry (grudzinska et al. 2005), implying
the existence of prolines at three of the ﬁve 2¢ positions.

given the large size of the 2¢ proline relative to glycine and
the conclusion above that steric volume at least partly
mediates a2 glyr discrimination between ptxinin and
ptn, it might be expected that the a1b glyr should be more
sensitive to ptxinin than ptn. we found, however, that the
a1b glyr was equally sensitive to both compounds (fig. 6a,
table 2) in contrast to the homomeric a1g2¢p glyr, which
was one hundred-fold more sensitive to ptxinin than ptn
(fig. 6a, table 2). one possible explanation is that in a1b
 xxxg863xxx , the a1 g2¢ residues create sufﬁcient space for ptn
binding despite the prolines at the 2¢ position in the b
subunit. alternatively, the other differences in the b subunit
may have broader effects on the overall structure of the pore,
increasing the space available at the 2¢ position. to
differentiate between these alternatives, we investigated the
ptxinin and ptn sensitivities of the a1bp2¢g glyr, which
restores the ring of 2¢ glycines, but incorporates the b
subunit. as shown in fig. 6c, the a1bp2¢g glyr exhibits a
drastically decreased sensitivity to ptn relative to ptxinin,
the reverse of what occurs in homomeric a1  xxxg863xxx  when a
ring of 2¢ glycines is present. these results imply that the b
subunit as a whole imposes a structural change that alters the
structure of the 2¢– 6¢ binding site. consequently, we
conclude that the determinants of ptxinin and ptn
binding to the a1 homomeric glyr do not apply directly
to the a1b glyr. investigation of the heteromeric receptor

discriminatory mechanism will be complicated by the
low sequence homology between the b and a1 subunits
(fig. 3a) and the difﬁculty in ascertaining the functional
expression of b subunits with increased sensitivities to
ptxinin and ptn.
ptxinin and ptn as glyr subunit-specific
pharmacological probes
glycinergic synapses on neurons in spinal cord dorsal horn
nociceptive pathways comprise either a1b or a3b  xxxg863xxx  or a
mixture of both (harvey et al. 2004; zeilhofer et al. 2005). it
is not yet possible to deﬁne the respective roles of these
receptors in pain signaling because few, if any, compounds
are known to selectively discriminate between a1- and a3containing  xxxg863xxx  (webb and lynch 2007). as a3 glyr
subunits contain an alanine at the 2¢ position (fig. 3), we
hypothesized that a3b  xxxg863xxx  may be pharmacologically
differentiated from a1b  xxxg863xxx  by a differential sensitivity to
ptxinin and ptn. accordingly, we measured the ptxinin and ptn inhibitory dose-responses at the homomeric a3
glyr and the heteromeric a3b glyr. the results, summarized in fig. 7 and table 2, conﬁrm that a3 and a3b  xxxg863xxx 
are both more sensitive to ptxinin than to ptn. in fig. 7a
and b, the corresponding ptxinin and ptn dose-response
curves for the a1 and a1b  xxxg863xxx , respectively, are included
as dashed lines for comparison. the a1b and a3b  xxxg863xxx

share a similar sensitivity to ptn, although a3b  xxxg863xxx  are
signiﬁcantly more sensitive than a1b  xxxg863xxx  to ptxinin.
table 2 also shows that the a3 homomeric glyr is much
more sensitive than the a3b heteromeric glyr to ptxinin.
this compound thus provides a better tool than ptx or ptn
for discriminating between these two isoforms in heterologous expression systems.

discussion

structural basis of ptxinin and ptn binding in the
homomeric a1 glyr pore
mutations can affect antagonist ic50 values either by directly
modifying ligand binding sites or by non-speciﬁc structural
disruptions. comparing the effects of two blockers with
closely related structures can help to discriminate between
these possibilities. the reasoning for this is that non-speciﬁc
structural disruptions should have similar effects on the
binding of two molecules with closely related structures
provided that they interact with the receptor through multiple
similar binding interactions. thus, the fact that 2¢ mutations
had differential effects on glyr sensitivity to ptxinin and
ptn suggests direct interactions between residues at the 2¢
pore-lining position and the non-conserved molecular groups
on these molecules.
threonine residues can contribute to both hydrogen bonds
(via their hydroxyl groups) and to hydrophobic interactions
(via their methyl groups). selective elimination of the 6¢
threonine hydrophobic interacting capability via the structurally-conservative t6¢s mutation, of their hydrogen bonding capability by the t6¢v mutation, and of both by the t6¢a
mutation, completely eliminated sensitivity to both ptxinin
and ptn in homomeric a1  xxxg863xxx . these results imply that
both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds contributed by 6¢ threonine residues are important for coordinating

ptxinin and ptn. the a1 subunit t6¢f mutation strongly
reduced receptor sensitivity to both compounds but did not
eliminate it (fig. 4b). as this substitution also eliminates the
hydrogen bonding capacity of the 6¢ side chain, it might be
expected that it should also eliminate the ability of both
compounds to bind in the pore. the fact that it does not
implies that the larger phenylalanine side chain imposes a
non-speciﬁc structural disruption that partially compensates
for the loss in afﬁnity caused by elimination of the
hydrophobic interaction capability. nevertheless, the t6¢f
result is signiﬁcant as it is an example of a 6¢ mutation that
equally affects receptor sensitivity to ptxinin and ptn.
together, these results allow us to conclude that 6¢ threonines
coordinate ptxinin and ptn via molecular groups common to both molecules. molecular modeling reveals the three
common exocyclic oxygens to be the most likely hydrogen
bond receivers.
as mutations to 2¢ residues have differential effects on
receptor sensitivity to ptxinin and ptn, we conclude that
the non-conserved regions of ptxinin and ptn are located
directly adjacent to this part of the pore. it is worth
reconsidering the structural differences between the molecules. ptn is larger than ptxinin by the size of a water
molecule. the ptn dimethyl-methanol group can contribute
to hydrophobic interactions via its two methyl groups and to
hydrogen bonds via its hydroxyl group, whereas the
ptxinin isopropenyl group is capable of forming only
hydrophobic interactions. the two molecules can thus be
discriminated on the basis of size, chemical bonding
properties, or both.
the homomeric a1 glyr contains a ring of small 2¢
glycine residues which expose both polar and non-polar
backbone groups to the pore lumen. the g2¢s substitution,
which adds a hydrogen bond donor to the side chain, had no
effect on sensitivity to ptxinin but drastically reduced
sensitivity to ptn. this result strongly suggests that ptn is

excluded on the basis of its larger size. the g2¢a substitution, which also reduces the pore exposure of backbone
groups and adds a moderately hydrophobic methyl group to
the side chain, signiﬁcantly increases receptor sensitivity to
ptxinin but modestly reduces sensitivity to ptn. this
result is also consistent with a size exclusion mechanism but
suggests that ptxinin may have enhanced binding to this
residue via a hydrophobic interaction.
ptxinin and ptn binding in the heteromeric a1b glyr
pore
incorporation of the b subunit is known to produce a
dramatic (>20-fold) reduction in ptx sensitivity (pribilla
et al. 1992; lynch et al. 1995). in the present study we found
that b subunit co-expression produced an approximately 5fold reduction in a1 glyr sensitivity to both ptxinin and
ptn (table 2), suggesting that our experiments may have
been performed on a mixture of a1 homomeric and a1b
heteromeric receptors (burzomato et al. 2003). however,
this uncertainty does not impinge signiﬁcantly on our ability
to interpret the b subunit results because the presumed
receptor mixture exhibited similar sensitivities to ptxinin
and ptn whereas the bp2¢g mutation caused a signiﬁcant and
selective decrease in ptn sensitivity (table 2).
the unusually low m2 domain amino acid sequence
homology between glyr b and a subunits implies that
heteromeric ab  xxxg863xxx  and a homomeric  xxxg863xxx  have
different pore structures. thus, the above discriminatory
mechanism may not necessarily pertain to b subunitcontaining  xxxg863xxx . indeed, despite containing three bulky
prolines at the 2¢ position, heteromeric a1b  xxxg863xxx  are
equally sensitive to ptxinin and ptn. when these prolines
are replaced by glycines, the a1bp2¢g  xxxg863xxx  retain a
relatively high sensitivity to ptxinin but sensitivity to
ptn is largely lost. this result cannot be reconciled with the
pattern observed with a1 homomeric  xxxg863xxx  and indicates
that the a1b glyr pore discriminates between ptxinin and
ptn via a different mechanism to homomeric a  xxxg863xxx . note
that the generally lower ptx sensitivity of a1b heteromeric
 xxxg863xxx  is due to a reduction in the number of 6¢ threonines, as
substitution of b subunit 6¢ phenylalanines by threonines
restores ptx sensitivity (shan et al. 2001).
ptxinin and ptn as pharmacological probes
inhibition of a3b  xxxg863xxx  by the inﬂammatory mediator,
 xxxd1903xxx , in spinal cord lamina i neurons results in
the disinhibition of ﬁring in nociceptive projection neurons
(ahmadi et al. 2002; harvey et al. 2004). this mechanism
may underlie inﬂammation-induced hyperalgesia or allodynia (zeilhofer 2005; lynch and callister 2006), and
substances that can restore glycinergic neurotransmission in
these neurons may have potential as therapeutic lead
compounds for chronic inﬂammatory pain. the a3b and
a1b  xxxg863xxx  are equally represented at lamina i neuronal

synapses (harvey et al. 2004). although both receptor
subtypes are potential therapeutic targets, their relative
contributions to the net glycinergic synaptic current magnitude are as yet unknown. it is also not known why the a3
subunit is highly expressed in these neurons, but is sparsely
distributed throughout the rest of the spinal cord (harvey
et al. 2004). resolving these questions may provide useful
insights into spinal cord pain processing mechanisms. we
have shown that the a1b glyr is equally sensitive to
ptxinin and ptn, whereas the a3b glyr has a three-fold
increased sensitivity to ptxinin over ptn. thus, a
comparison of the inhibitory effects of ptn and ptxinin
may be useful for estimating the relative contributions of a1b
and a3b  xxxg863xxx  to the net glycinergic synaptic current.
conclusion

our results suggest that ptxinin and ptn bind to t6¢
residues by hydrogen bonding with the three exocyclic
double-bonded oxygens common to both molecules. when
ptxinin and ptn are coordinated in this position, their
variable groups align with the 2¢ level (fig. 3b). we propose
that there is minimal chemical bonding with pore-lining
groups near the 2¢ level and that both compounds have
equivalent afﬁnities at the homomeric a1 glyr because the
2¢ glycine side chain affords sufﬁcient space to accommodate
both molecules equally well. however, homomeric a2 and
a3  xxxg863xxx  and most gabaar subunits contain larger
residues at the 2¢ position. we propose that these reduce
space available at the 2¢ level, which sterically prevents the
larger ptn molecule from adopting its optimal binding
position in the pore. the binding of the ptxinin may also
be improved by a hydrophobic interaction between the 2¢
alanine and its unique isoproprenyl group. thus, homomeric
 xxxg863xxx , and probably also gabaars, discriminate between
ptxinin and ptn primarily on the basis of size. in contrast,
heteromeric a1b  xxxg863xxx  are equally sensitive to ptxinin
and ptn despite containing three bulky proline residues at
the 2¢ position. this suggests that the above discriminatory
mechanism may not apply to b subunit-containing  xxxg863xxx . as
a3b  xxxg863xxx  exhibit a differential sensitivity to ptxinin and
ptn whereas a1b  xxxg863xxx  do not, a comparative analysis of
the effect of both compounds may be useful for estimating
the relative contributions of a3b and a1b  xxxg863xxx  to
glycinergic inhibition in spinal nociceptive neurons.
