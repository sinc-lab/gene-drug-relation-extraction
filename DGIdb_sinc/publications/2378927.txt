dopaminergic mechanism of imipranfine action in
an animal model of depression
richard muscat, david sampson, and paul willner

rats, subjected chronically (10-12 weeks) to a variety of mild, unpredictable stressors,
showed a decrease in their consumption of weak sucrose solutions; normal behavior was
restored by chronic (5-9 weeks) treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine.
acute administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist  xxxd2956xxx  or the specific  xxxg656xxx  antagonist raclopride had no effect in nonstressed animals and in
vehicle-treated stressed animals, but both drugs selectively reversed the improvement of
performance in imipramine-treated stressed animals. the 5ht antagonist metergoline
increased sucrose consumption in all groups. the data suggest that the mechanism of
action of imipramine in this model is an increase in functional activity at dopamine (da)
synapses.
introduction
antidepressant drugs have traditionally been assumed to exert their clinical effects through
an interaction with noradrenergic or serotonergic systems. however, after chronic adm':.nistration, antidepressants have also been found to potentiate the locomotor stimulant effects
of dopamine (da) agonists. these effects are apparent following systemic administration
(amt et al. 1984; maj et al. 1984a, 1984b; martin-lverson et al. 1983; willner and
montgomery 1981) or direct injection of da agonists into the nucleus accumbens (maj
and wedzony 1985, 1988; maj et al. 1987). as the locomotor stimulant effects of da
agonists administered systematically are mediated by da receptors in the nucleus aecumbens (kelly et al. 1975), these data suggest that chronic adrrhnistration of antidepressant drugs may enhance the responsiveness of postsynaptic receptors in the mesolimbic
da system. binding studies have revealed a decrease in the number of d1 binding sites
in the nucleus accumbens (klimek and nielsen 1987), and no change in the number of
d2 sites (martin-iverson et al. 1983; klimek and nielsen !987); however, an increase
in d2 agonist affinity has been observed, which may explain the behavioral data (klimek
and maj 1989).
nevertheless, the relevance of antidepressant-induced alterations in da function is
questionable. in all of the studies cited above (as in the great majority of studies of the
effects of chronic antidepressant treatment), antidepressants were administered to "nor-

mal" animals, and the results must be evaluated in the context of the widespread belief
that artidepressants do not elevate mood in nondepressed people. in the present study,
instead of using normal rats, we have attempted to assess the role of da in the therapeutic
action of antidepressants administered chronically within an animal model of depression.
though there are many animal models of depression (willner 1984, 1990), relatively
few of them have a time course suitable for such experiments. the model we have used
is a substantially milder version of a chronic stress regime developed by katz (1982). in
this model, after chronic exposure to a variety of low-grade stressors, rats are found to
reduce their consumption of, and preference for, highly rewarding sucrose and saccharin
solutions. this deficit, which may model the anhedonia that is a central feature of
endogenous depressions, is restored to normal follow~_ngseveral weeks of treatment with
the tficyclic antidepressants desmethylimipramine (dmi) or amitriptyline (willner et al.
1987; muscat et al. 1988; sampson et al. 1990).
in a parallel study, we have shown that the da antagonists sulpiride and sch-23390
reduced the consumption of a sweet solution in chronically stressed rats successfully
treated with dmi or amitriptyline, but did not reduce consumption in nonstressed animals
or in untreated stressed animals. these data argue strongly that an increase in da receptor
responsiveness may be responsible for the therapeutic action of dmi and amitriptyline
in this model (sampson et al. 1990). in the present study, we extend these observations
to another tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine: imipramine also restored sucrose consumption in stressed animals, and the effect was blocked by  xxxd2956xxx  and by the highly
selective  xxxg656xxx  antagonist raclopride (de paulis et al. 1986).
chronic treatment with tricyclic antidepressants is known to alter a number of parameters of serotonergic (5ht) function (reviewed by deakin 1989; willner 1989), and the
5ht antagonist metergoline has been found to reverse antidepressant action in olfactory
bulbectomized rats (broekkamp et al. 1980) and in a novel model of cooperative social
behavior (willner et al. 1989). we now report that unlike da antagonists, metergoline
did not reverse the action of imipramine in rats subjected chronically to mild stress.
methods

subjects
adult male lister hooded rats (nimr, mill hill) were used in both experiments; mean
initial weights were 300 g in experiment 1 (n = 64) and 250 g in experiment 2 (n =
60). except as described below, they were housed singly in plastic cages (26 x 19 x
38 cm; noah kent cages) containing a layer of sawdust, and maintained on a 12-hr
light/dark cycle (light on 08.00) with food (special diet services, witham, essex) and
water freely available.

fluid consumption tests
seventy two hours before the start of experiment 1, animals were given a continuous 48hr exposure to two bottles, one containing a 1% solution of sucrose, the other tap water,
the bottles were counterbalanced across the left and right sides of the feeding compartment; this procedure was adopted for two-bottle tests throughout the experiment. in
experiment 2, the animals received a similar preexposure to a single bottle of 0.7%
sucrose. prior to testing for fluid consumption, animals were deprived of food and water
for 23 hr. testing was carded out in the animal's home cage 6 hr into the light cycle,
from 2 pm to 3 pm; fluid consumption was measured by reweighing preweighed bottles.

experiment 1
following an initial two-bottle fluid consumption test, the animals were divided into two
groups (n = 32) matched for their sucrose and water consumption. animals in one group
were subjected to a week-long mild stress regime (modified slightly from that described
in willner et al. 1987) that was repeated for 10 weeks; the other group was undisturbed,
except for injections and food and water deprivation prior to each fluid consumption test.
the stress regime consisted of two 20-hr periods of food and water deprivation, one
immediately prior to the sucrose intake test, the other followed by 2 hr of restricted access
to food (scattering of a few 45-mg precision pellets in the cage); one additional 16-hr
period of water deprivation, followed by ! hr of exposure to an empty bottle; two periods
of continuous overnight illumination; two periods (7 and 17 hr) of 45 ° cage tilt; one 17hr period of grouped housing; one 17-hr period in a soiled cage (100 mi water in sawdust
bedding); two periods (3 and 5 hr) of intermittent white noise (85 db); three periods (7,9,
and 17 hr) of low intensity stroboscopic illumination (300 flasbes/min).
at the end of the fourth week of stress, each group was subdivided into two subgroups
(n = 16), matched for sucrose and water consumption. each subgroup then received
daily injections of saline or imipramine (5 mg/kg), beginning on the friday of week 5.
the groups were further subdivided (n = 8) on the basis of their performance in week
9. in week 10, one subgroup from each of the four conditions received a single injection
of  xxxd2956xxx  (0.15 mg/kg) 4 hr prior to their fluid consumption test; the other subgroups
received vehicle injections.
a preliminary account of experiment 1 has been previously presented (willner et al.
1988).

experiment 2
the second experiment used the same stress regime. one group of stressed and one group
of nonstressed animals (n = 15) received irrfipramine (5 mg/kg) daily from week 4 to
week 12 of stress, inclusive. in weeks 3, 8, 9, and 11, a modified stress regime was
administered in which stressors were presented at night only: this regime consisted of
overnight exposures to continuous iuumination (twice), soiled cage, white noise, grouped
housing, stroboscopic illumination, and cage tilt.
during these weeks, and also in the week prior to stress onset, consumption of five
different sucrose concentrations (0.7%, 2.4%, 7%, 13.6%, 34%) were tested on successive
days from tuesday to saturday. the data from these tests, which form part of a separate
study, will be reported elsewhere (in preparation). during week 12, all animals received
single doses of ~ e specific d2 antagonist raclopride (100 ~g/kg, 15 min pretreatment),
the 5ht antagonist metergoline (1 mg/kg, 60 min pretreatment), and vehicle prior to
fluid consumption tests. these three treatments were administered on different days,with
at least 2 days between successive tests, ijl a balanced desigr:~

drugs
imipramine (ciba-geigy, horsham) was dissolved in distilled water and administered at
7 pm daily.  xxxd2956xxx  (janssen, wantage) and metergoline (farmitalia, milan) were
dissob,ed in a few drops of glacial acetic acid and made up to volume with distilled
water. raclopride (astra, sodertalje) was dissolved in distilled water. appropriate vehicle
solutions were used for control injections. all injections were i.p., in a volume of 1
ml/kg.

analysis
data were subjected to analysis of variance (anova), supplemented by tests of simple
main effects and planned comparisons (t-tests using the appropriate anova error term)
were calculated where appropriate. in experiment 2, variances were significantly greater
after metergoline treatment; the metergoline and raclopride data were therefore analyzed
and presented separately.

results
in both experiments, sucrose consumption decreased substantially over weeks in stressed
animals. at the inception of imipramh¢ treatment, consumption in stressed animals,
relative to controls, had fallen to 64% in experiment 1 and 66% in experiment 2 [f(1,600)
= 18.7, p < 0.001; f(1,392) = 27.1, p < 0.001, respectively]. imipramine treatment
(for 5 and 9 weeks, respectively) significantly increased sucrose consumption, relative
to that of untreated animals, in both experiments [f(1,600) = 4.3, p < 0.05; f(1,392)
= 13.5, p < 0.001]; in neither case did imipramine-treated stressed animals differ
significantly from treated controls [f(i,600) = 0.03; f(1,392) = 0.5, ns]. imipramine
did not increase sucrose consumption in nonstressed animals [f(1,600) = 0.01; f(1,392)
= 0.7, nsl.
both pimo~ide (figure l) and raclopride (figure 2) significantly decreased sucrose
intake in imipramine-treated stressed animals [f(1,28) = 4.9, p < 0.05; f(1,56) =
7. l, p = 0.61, respectively], and abolished the differences between treated and untreated
groups. neither drug significantly altered behavior in nonstressed animals or in untreated
stressed animals. by contrast, metergoline (figure 2) significantly increased sucrose intake
in all four groups [f(1,56) = 89, p < 0.001]. despite these changes in baseline intake,

discussion

we have previously shown that sacrose consumption in chronically stressed animals is
restored by dmi or amitriptyline (willner et al. 1987; muscat et al. 1988; sampson et
al. 1990). the present experiments extend this observation to a thir6 tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine. the action of imipramine was selectively reversed by the da
antagonists  xxxd2956xxx  and raclopride, at low doses which were without effect in control
animals. in a parallel s~,udy (sa~r,pson et al. 1990), we have shown a similar selective
reversal of the therapeutic effects of dmi and amitriptyline by the da ,antagonists sulpiride
and sch-23390. in this case, the observations were made during withdrawal from antidepressant treatment; thus, there was no possibility of these data being contaminated
by pharmacokinetic intei'actions. in the present study, although the effects of antagonists
were tested during the course of imipramine treatment, it is most unlikely that pharrnacokinetic interactions contribute to the results, as  xxxd2956xxx  and raclopride had no effect
in imipramine-treated but nonstressed animals.
in other studies, we have demonstrated that at higher doses, both  xxxd2956xxx  (towell
et al. 1987) and raclopride (in preparation), as well as sulpiride and sch-23390 (muscat
and willner 1989), do reduce sucrose consumption in untreated animals. the fact that
the da antagonists selectively reduced sucrose consumption in antidepressant-treated

stressed animals thus indicates an increased sensitivity to d ~ antagonists in these animals.
the most likely mechanism of these effects is the widely repolxed increase in da-receptor
responsiveness that is typically observed after chronic antidepressant treatment (see introduction).
after chronic treatment, antidepressants have also been found, in eleetrophysiological
studies, to increase transmission through 5ht-1 receptors by a combination of pre- and
postsynaptic mechanisms (reviewed by w'.':'.',er 1989). this effect has been seen with all
classes of antidepressant drugs, including even monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois),
which desensitize 5ht-i receptors (de montigny and blier 1984; blier et al. 1984). the
functional significance of these observations is confirmed by the finding that in certain
behavioral models, the action of antidepressants may be blocked by the 5ht antagonist,
metergoline (broekkamp et al. 1980; willner et al. 1989). furthermore, in a small number
of patients, the actions of imipramine or the maoi tranylcypromine were reversed by
the 5ht synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine (pcpa) (shopsin et al. 1975, 1976).
nevertheless, metergoline was ineffective in reversing the action of imipramine in the
present study, at a dose (1 mg/kg) that was behaviorally active. the enhanced sucrose
consumption (in all groups) following metergoline treatment was not unexpected in light
of the putative role of 5ht in consummatory behavior (blundell 1986; garattini et al.
1986) and the ability of metergoline to increase food intake (fletcher 1988).
metergoline did not reverse the effect of imipramine in the present study, but the same
dose of metergoline did reverse the action of imipramine in another model: the restoration
of cooperative social behavior after chronic social isolation (willner et al. 1989). the
dose of imipramine (5 mg/kg) and the rat strain were the same in the two studies, and
the imipramine dosing regimes were very similar.
the important implication of these findings is that the search for a unitary mechanism
of antidepressant action may be misconceived, lmipranfine, administered at the same
dose and over similar chronic time scales, acts through different mechanisms in the
different behavioral paradigms. in the present study, the action of imipramine was reversed
by da antagonists but not by metergoline. however, in a different behavioral model,
metergoline did reverse the action of imipramine (willner et al. 1989). these data suggest
strongly that antidepressants may act clinically through a variety of neurochemical mechanisms, with different functional correlates.
we are grateful to ciba-geigy, janssen, and astra for their generous gifts of imipramine, phnozi~¢, arid
raclopride, respectively.we also thank martin lyon who prepared the figuresfor this manuscript.
