altered membrane permeability as the basis of bactericidal action of  xxxd2593xxx .  the growth inhibition of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus was accompanied by significant release of k+ and uv-absorbing small molecules upon exposure to  xxxd2593xxx , an extensively used phenothiazine antihistamine. a severe decrease in [u-14c] glucose uptake and a rapid efflux of hexose from sugar-preloaded bacteria were also observed but without visible cellular lysis. considerable damage to membrane permeability by  xxxd2593xxx  was proposed to explain the rapid loss in cfu/ml of the bacteria.
