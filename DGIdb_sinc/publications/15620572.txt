abstract
male fischer-344 rats (n = 38) at 5 months old were tested in a morris water maze to determine if treatment
with the cholinesterase inhibitor,  xxxd2912xxx  (phen), would overcome a learning impairment induced by
scopolamine (scop), a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist. each rat was randomly assigned to one of five
groups to receive two intraperitoneal injections 60 and 30 min, prior to testing, respectively, as follows: (1) salinesaline (sal); (2) saline-1.0 mg/kg (scop); (3) 2 mg/kg phen- scop (phen2); (4) 4 mg/kg phen-scop
(phen4); and (5) 1 mg/kg phen-sal (phen1). maze testing occurred across 5 days with 4 days of acquisition
trials (4 trials per day) and a fifth day consisting of a single 120 sec probe trial. phen1 and sal were combined
into one control (con) group for purposes of statistical analysis for both acquisition and probe trials as
comparison of the two groups revealed that they did not significantly differ on any measure. scop-treated rats
were significantly impaired compared to con in learning the location of the submerged platform as measured by
latency to locate the platform and the distance traversed to find the platform across days of testing. the phen4
group had significantly lower latencies and traveled a shorter distance to reach the submerged platform when
compared to scop on the fourth day of trials while the phen2 group traveled more directly to the submerged

platform but did not have shorter latencies than the scop group. for probe trials, con rats swam closer to the
target area (a measure of proximity to the removed platform) than did all other groups, and the phen4 group
swam in an area more proximate to the target area than did the scop-treated group. these findings demonstrate
the ability of this drug to improve learning when cholinergic function has been impaired in a spatial memory task.

introduction
alzheimerts disease (ad) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder whose most notable symptom
is progressive memory loss followed by general cognitive decline that is affecting an increasingly large
number of older persons (giacobini, 2002; sano, 2002). ad results from neurodegeneration
characterized by deposition of amyloid plaques, development of neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation,
and neuronal loss in specific forebrain regions (sambamurti et al., 2002). although multiple
neurotransmitter systems appear to be affected in ad, degeneration and functional impairment in the
cholinergic system has received the greatest amount of research attention (giacobini, 2003). neuronal
loss in the basal forebrain, particularly in septohippocamal acetylcholinergic (ach) systems that are
involved in learning and memory processes, constitute a pathological hallmark of ad.
to address this cholinergic dysfunction, a major therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ad has been
to develop compounds that can increase ach at the synapse. the development of cholinesterase
inhibitors (cheis) has been the general focus of this strategy (darvesl et al., 2003; giacobini, 2002;
greig et al., 1995) with acetylcholinesterase inhibition (achei) receiving most attention. recently,
 xxxg248xxx  (bchei) and its role in alzeheimerts disease, particularly in the reduction of hamyloid deposition has received attention (giacobini, 2002; greig et al., 2002). currently cheis
represent the only class of drugs approved for clinical use for ad in the u.s. (grutzendler and morris,
2001), with the recent exception of memantine, which is an nmda  xxxg981xxx  antagonist
(reisberg et al., 2003). a number of ache inhibitors (achei) are presently in use, in clinical trials or
under basic investigation. cognex, also known as (aka) tacrine, is a non-selective acetyl-and  xxxg248xxx  inhibitor with a duration of action of approximately 2–3 hr. this drug has been minimally
effective in alleviating the cognitive deficits associated with ad and has a high incidence of
hepatotoxicity (qizilbash et al., 1998; davis et al., 1992). newer generations of achei have been
developed and several, such as eptastigmine (aka heptyl-physostigmine; braida et al., 2000; braida and
sala, 2001), galanthamine (corey-bloom, 2003) and ganstigmine (jhee et al., 2003).. however,
eptastigmine and ganstigmine have been dropped from clinical trials. galanthamine, in addition to its
short course of action, causes nausea and vomiting in many patients. the fda has approved the achei
e2020, aka aricept or donepezil, for use in ad patients (nobili et al., 2002). all of the abovementioned drugs have had effects on cognition of a similar magnitude.
 xxxd2912xxx , ( )-phenylcaramoyleseoline (l)-tartrate ( xxxd2912xxx ), is a physostigmine derivitive that
has selective, long-acting and brain-directed achei activity (greig et al., 1995). this compound has
been effective in attenuating scopolamine-induced and age-related memory impairments in rats in a 14unit t-maze (ikari et al., 1995; iijima et al., 1993).  xxxd2912xxx  is currently in multicenter phase 3 clinical
trials, having demonstrated improvements with minimal side effects in cognitive performance in ad.

preclinical work in the development of  xxxd2912xxx  relied primarily upon one model of learning, the
stone 14-unit t-maze (patel et al., 1998). this task requires the rat to learn a reponse pattern of left-right
position discriminations to avoid the onset of a mild footshock. the objective of the current study was to
investigate the efficacy of phen in another learning model that taxes spatial memory abilities,
specifically the morris water maze (morris, 1984). the water maze paradigm has proven highly useful
for assessing cholinergic dysfunction and has been used for assessing the efficacy of cheis (mcnamara
and skelton, 1993). similar to past demonstrations in the 14-unit t-maze, we examine the ability of
 xxxd2912xxx  to attenuate a learning impairment induced by scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor
antagonist.

methods
subjects
thirty-eight male fischer-344 rats 4 months old were shipped to the grc from the nia colony
maintained by harlan sprague-dawley (indianapolis, in). the rats were housed two per cage in a
vivarium maintained at 21 8c. food (nih-07) was provided ad libitum and water was provided via an
automated watering system. the vivarium was maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with lights on at
6:00 am est. behavioral testing commenced when the rats were 5 mo old, and all testing occurred
during the light cycle.
drug administration
each rat was randomly assigned to one of 5 groups to receive a set of two intraperitoneal
injections 60 and 30 min prior to morris water maze (mwm) testing on each of five testing days.
sixty minutes prior to mwm testing each rat received an injection of either physiological saline
(sal) or 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg dose of  xxxd2912xxx  (phen1, phen2, or phen4) and 30 min later
received an injection of either sal or 1 mg/kg scopolamine (scop) to comprise the following
groups: saline-saline (sal; n = 8); saline-1 mg/kg scop (scop; n = 7); 2 mg/kg phen- 1 mg/kg
scop (phen2; n = 9);4 mg/kg phen-1 mg/kg of scop (phen4; n = 9); and 1 mg/kg of phensaline (phen1; n = 5). all drugs were prepared fresh daily, and physiological saline was used as a
buffer. volume of injection was 1ml/kg.
apparatus and procedure
a mwm was utilized for all behavioral testing according to a procedure adapted from frick et al.
(1996). a white polyethylene tank 1.8 m in diameter and 0.6 m high, was filled with 35 cm of water. a
clear plastic platform was submerged to 1.5 cm below the water surface. a white curtain surrounded the
entire maze, and cues were hung on the curtain to facilitate spatial navigation. a camera suspended
above the maze was wired to an automated tracking system (accuscan, columbus, oh) and was used to
track movement and location of the animal in the maze. to facilitate tracking rats were dyed black with
color-fast hair dye (lady clairol). music was provided by four speakers located adjacent to the maze
during testing to mask external noise.

on day 1 each rat received an acclimation trial in which it was placed onto the submerged platform for
15 sec. the centers of the three quadrants most distant from the submerged platform, were used as start
points for each subject, and start points were pseudo-randomly rotated for each rat on each trial. each
day for four consecutive days, each rat was injected according to the schedule described above and then
given four trials in the water maze. the position of the ratts placement for starting each trial was changed
daily so that each position was tested at least 4 times over the course of maze testing. the rat was
allowed 120 sec to reach the platform on each trial. after 120 sec the rat was guided to the platform. the
rat was allowed to remain on the platform for 30 sec followed by 30 sec in a holding cage prior to the
next trial. on the fifth day the submerged platform was removed for a probe trial in which each rat was
placed in the pool to swim for 120 seconds and search patterns were recorded.
statistical analysis
to analyze learning, the 4 days of acquisition trials were subjected to a one-way anova (drug
treatment) with repeated measures (blocks of 4 daily trials) for the latency and distance measures. a
separate anova with repeated measures comparing performance of the sal and phen1 groups
revealed no significant differences on either measure, so these groups were combined for subsequent
analyses resulting in the following groupings for the analyses of acquisition performance: con
(combined sal and phen1), scop, phen2, and phen4.
fischerts lsd post-hoc tests were used to evaluate differences in mean scores for groups when main
effects were observed. significance was accepted as p b .05.
analysis of the probe trial data were conducted on the first 30 sec of the probe trial only, because a bin
analysis (devan et al., 2003) at 30-sec intervals revealed that nearly all of the animals rapidly
extinguished any preference for the quadrant where the platform had been located after 30 sec. as in the
acquisition analyses, sal and phen1 were combined into one group (con) for purposes of statistical
analysis, since comparisons of the two groups revealed no significant statistical difference.
for the probe trial a proximity analysis was conducted on the distance swam for each group. in this
measure, the average distance from the center of the goal location (the removed platform) was measured
for each sec of the initial 30 sec in the probe trial, similar to a measure developed by gallagher et al.
(1993), and automatically calculated by the tracking system (accuscan; columbus, oh).
a one-way anova was conducted for the proximity measure. fischer lsd post-hoc tests were
then conducted to determine the locus of the differences observed.

results
figs. 1 and 2 show the mean distance each group swam to reach the submerged platform at each day,
and the mean daily time to reach the submerged platform, respectively. the phen1 and sal groups are
shown separately to demonstrate that  xxxd2912xxx  alone did not affect performance, but for purposes of
statistical comparison the two groups were combined into one group, con.
a two-way, one repeated measures anova test of the acquisition phase of the experiment showed an
overall significant group effect for both distance swam to the platform f(3,34) = 34.98, p b 0.01 and
time it took for the subject to find the platform, f(3,34) = 27.25, p b 0.01. the within subjects measure,
day, also achieved significance for both distance and time measures, fts (3, 32) = 4.56 and 9.87,

respectively, indicating that learning had occurred across days of testing, as observed in figs. 1 and 2. a
significant group by day interaction was observed for the distance traversed measure, f (9, 102) = 2.72,
p b 0.01, but not for the time required to find the submerged platform, f (9, 102) = 1.76, p n 0.05.
post hoc fischer lsd tests were conducted for the distance measure at each day due to the observed
interaction between day and group. results of these post-hoc analyses revealed that the con group
traveled a significantly (pts b 0.05) shorter mean distance (cm) than all of the other groups and thus
swam a more direct path to the submerged platform during each day of trials. phen2 and phen4
traveled a smaller mean distance than the scop group to the submerged platform, but the differences
between the phen groups and scop was significant only on the fourth day of trials (pts b 0.05).
because no interaction was observed for the latency to locate the submerged platform measure,
fischer lsd post hoc tests were conducted on the overall mean latency per trial for each group to
determine the locus of the difference between groups. these analyses revealed that the con group
differed from each of the other groups (pts b 0.05) such that the con group required less time per trial to

locate the submerged platform.  xxxd2912xxx  did significantly lessen time to find the submerged platform
but only in the phen4 group compared to the scop group (p b 0.05).
analysis of the proximity to the target (location of the removed platform) during the probe trial
revealed a significant main effect, f (3,34) = 7.57, p b 0.001. basically, in this measure the smaller the
number (cm), the more the rat swam in the vicinity of the previously placed, submerged platform. as
shown in fig. 3 the con and phen4 groups swam significantly closer to the target area (p b 0.05).
con swam closer to the target area than did all other groups while the phen4 swam closer to the target
area compared to the scop group (pts b 0.05). thus,  xxxd2912xxx  did, at least in the phen4 group,
improve memory for the previous location of the submerged platform, as measured by swimming in
proximity to the removed platform during a probe trial, but it did not restore performance to con levels.

discussion
as in previously reported studies in the 14-unit t-maze (patel et al., 1998), systemic administration of
scop impairs learning performance in mwm in young rats. whereas, a 0.75 mg/kg dose of scop
consistently impairs performance in the 14-unit t-maze, in the present study, a slightly higher dose 1.0 mg/
kg was required to observe consistent deficits in learning performance in the water maze. systemic
 xxxd2912xxx  administration (i.p.) improved performance in scop-treated rats in the mwm, as
hypothesized, more so at a 4 mg/kg than a 2 mg/kg i.p. dose. moreover, the probe trial data provide
additional evidence that  xxxd2912xxx  may improve spatial memory, further supporting its utility in the
treatment of cognitive decline and memory loss in human conditions such as ad.
with these results,  xxxd2912xxx  treatment has now been demonstrated to improve learning
performance in two complex learning paradigms, the mwm and the 14-unit t-maze, in the rat by
overcoming the deficits induced by scop treatment, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist that has

1079

come to be accepted as a model of memory impairment in mammals. the 14-unit t-maze requires
the rat to learn a fixed series of 14 position discriminations that are configured as sequences of leftright turns. learning in this task does not require visual discriminations and it is likely that the rat
simply learns the maze through vestibulo-motor patterns or an orientation of its body within the
maze environment. the version of the mwm task used in the present study on the other hand,
requires the rat to navigate to a hidden platform using visual cues located on the curtains
surrounding the maze. placement of the rat into the tank at different locations on each trial further
increases the demands on the rat to attend visually to its environment, i.e., the location of the cues.
further, the two tasks differ in their motivational demands with 14-unit t-maze studies cited
requiring the rat to avoid or escape a mild shock as it traverses the maze and in the mwm the rat
must escape from water.
in the present study, the phen4 group failed to show strong spatial bias at the level demonstrated by the
con group, but did swim in closer proximity to the target area compared to the scop group. gallagher et
al. (1993) had previously introduced this variable indicating that it was a more spatially-selective
alternative measure to other dependent variables used to assess age-related cognitive dysfunction in
rodents. in the present study, it was anticipated that  xxxd2912xxx  would significantly improve spatial learning
performance in young animals treated with the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, scopolamine. this
finding confirmed our hypothesis that the  xxxd2912xxx  treatment would not only improve acquisition, as
observed in the fourth day of acquisition trials for both phen2 and phen4, but was also confirmed in
probe trial performance to further demonstrate that learning had occurred as shown in the spatial bias for
the quadrant where the submerged platform had previously been located in the phen 4 compared to the
scop only group.
brain extracellular acetylcholine levels are elevated following  xxxd2912xxx  administration as assessed
by in vivo microdialysis in the rat (greig et al., 2000). frey et al. (1985) using autoradiography
demonstrated that [3h]scopolamine binds to muscarinic receptors in the rat but that this binding in brain
regions with documented high muscarinic receptor density, e.g, hippocampus, was slow to label. they
interpreted these findings to mean that either tracer accessibility was limited or that endogenous levels of
acetylcholine competed off the tracer at the receptor site. the most viable interpretation of the present
data based upon the findings and observations in the greig et al and frey et al studies cited above would
be that  xxxd2912xxx  provides higher levels of endogenous acetylcholine through its potent, long-acting
cholinesterase inhibition, and that this extracellular pool of acetylcholine then competes with
scopolamine at muscarinic cholinergic receptor sites.
 xxxd2912xxx  is among a class of second generation cholinesterase inhibitors that are unlike firstgeneration natural products such as galanthamine and physostigmine. a group of anticholinesterases,
including tacrine, galanthamine, and aricept have already been approved by the fda in the united states
for treatment of ad. the benefits of  xxxd2912xxx  appear to be in its duration of action, high brain
distribution, and its effectiveness in lessening cognitive effects of disease, without significant side effects
including liver toxicity in preliminary clinical assessment. whether or not these advantages culminate in a
more optimal drug for ad treatment is the focus of ongoing phase 3 clinical trials.
the findings reported herein further confirm the ability of  xxxd2912xxx  to overcome a scopolamineinduced memory impairment in another complex learning task, the morris water maze. we have reported
in several previous studies that  xxxd2912xxx  could overcome a scopolamine-induced learning impairment
in shock-motivated 14-unit t-maze, as well as improve the performance of aged rats in the 14-unit tmaze. the implications of this compound for human subjects with age-associated dementia such as ad

1080

a.m. janas et al. / life sciences 76 (2005) 1073–1081

appear promising based on results of phase 2 clinical trials, but further confirmation must await the
outcome of ongoing pivotal phase 3 trials.
