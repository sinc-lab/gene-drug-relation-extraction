summary.  xxxd269xxx , and other saturated dicarboxylie
acids ( c 9 - c12), are shown to be competitive inhibitors of
tyrosinase (kl  xxxd269xxx  = 2.73 • 10- 3 m ) and of membrane-associated  xxxg1826xxx  (/(i  xxxd269xxx  =
1.25 • 10- s m). the monomethyl ester of  xxxd269xxx  does
not inhibit  xxxg1826xxx , but it does inhibit tyrosinase, although double the concentration is necessary compared with  xxxd269xxx  (ki  xxxd269xxx  monomethyl
ester = 5.24 • 10 -3 m). neither  xxxd269xxx  nor its monomethyl ester inhibit tyrosinase when catechol is used as a
substrate instead of l-tyrosine. therefore, the weak inhibitory action of  xxxd269xxx  on tyrosinase appears to be due
to the competition of a single carboxylate group on this
inhibitor for the ~-carboxylate binding site of the l-tyrosine
substrate on the enzyme active site. based on the inhibitor
constant on tyrosinase, at least cytotoxic levels of  xxxd269xxx 
acid would be required for the direct inhibition of melanin
biosynthesis in melanosomes if this mechanism is responsible for depigmentation in the hyperpigmentation disorders
lentigo maligna and melasma. alternatively only 1 0 - s m
 xxxd269xxx  is required to inhibit  xxxg1826xxx .
this enzyme is shown to regulate tyrosinase through a
feedback mechanism involving electron transfer to intracellular thioredoxin, followed by a specific interaction between reduced thioredoxin and tyrosinase. furthermore,
the  xxxg1826xxx ]thioredoxin system is shown to
be a principal electron donor for the ribonucleotide reductases which regulates d n a synthesis. inhibition of
 xxxg1826xxx  by  xxxd269xxx  provides a rationale
for both its depigmenting property and the reversible inhibition of d n a synthesis observed in cultured epidermal
cells and also in some of the bacteria associated with acne
vulgaris.

 xxxd269xxx  has been reported to reversibly inhibit tyrosinase and directly interfere with melanin biosynthesis
[13, 14]. due to its depigmenting properties and its low
toxicity, it has been used in the treatment of the
hyperpigmentation disorders, lentigo maligna and
melasma [15, 18]. recently, the use of this drug in the
treatment of lentigo maligna has become controversial
due to the progression of some patients to lentigo maligna
melanoma [2, 12, 17]. however, studies in cell cultures of
human keratinocytes, melanocytes, and melanoma cells
showed a concentration-dependent, though reversible, inhibition of d n a synthesis and cell proliferation [9]. the
growth of human melanoma cells revealed inhibitory reactions of 50% - 7 0 % by the addition of 10- 2m  xxxd269xxx 
acid to culture media [9]. similarly,  xxxd269xxx  has been
found to function as a bacteriostatic agent by inhibiting
d n a synthesis in some of the bacteria associated with
acne vulgaris, whereas other bacteria have been resistant
to inhibition by this  xxxd2537xxx  [8]. therefore,
 xxxd269xxx  appears to have the dual function of (a)
being a depigmenting agent and (b) interfering with d n a
synthesis. these results were surprising, since the only
chemically reactive groups in  xxxd269xxx , and on other
active saturated dicarboxylic acids (c9-c12), reside in
the two terminal carboxylate moieties.
the sequence of human tyrosinase has been determined recently [7], and the histidine residues which coordinate to the two copper atoms in the active site of this
enzyme have been shown to be conserved to provide
identical active sites for the mushroom, neurospora, and
human enzymes [10]. thus, active site studies with competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase should be valid whether
the enzyme tested has been isolated from mushroom or
man [10]. even though the competitive inhibition of
mushroom tyrosinase by dicarboxylic acids has been reported earlier [14], a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of these dicarboxylic acids remained to
be resolved. the binding of l-tyrosine to the active site
of tyrosinase most likely involves three sites: (a) the coordination of the phenolate group to one of the copper
centers [10]; (b) the formation of an "ion pair" between

k. u. schallreuter and j. w. wood: mechanism for  xxxd269xxx 
the negatively charged group of the e-carboxylate of ltyrosine with a positively charged group on the enzyme
(i. e., lysine, arginine, or histidine residue), and (c) "ionpair" formation between the positively charged e-ammonium group of l-tyrosine with a negatively charged
amino acid on the enzyme (i. e., a glutamic or aspartic
acid residue). catechol, which functions as an alternative
substrate for tyrosinase (i.e., catecholase activity [10]),
reacts only with the copper active site and not with any
of the amino-acid residues near the active site [10]. therefore, both l-tyrosine and catechol may be used as alternative substrates to determine the mechanism of action o f
 xxxd269xxx  as an inhibitor of tyrosinase.
 xxxd269xxx  and other saturated dicarboxylic acids
have been found to reversibly inhibit membrane-associated  xxxg1826xxx  (tr) at the surface of guinea
pig skin, at the surface of keratinocytes, melanocytes,
and melanoma cells, and on purified enzymes from
escherichia coli, and human metastatic melanotic melanoma cells membranes [22, 24]. membrane-associated
t r has been found to have a dual function at the surface
of the human epidermis, (a) to reduce free radicals (r')
[21,23, 27, 28, 30] and (b) to regulate melanin biosynthesis
by an nadph/tr/thioredoxin/tyrosinase feedback
mechanism [19, 20, 23, 25, 2 7 - 3 0 ] . t r forms a stable
bis-cysteinate complex with one of the copper atoms in
the active site of tyrosinase and thus regulates enzyme
activity through the formation of a protein-protein inhibitor complex [21, 32]. furthermore, the tr/thioredoxin electron transfer system has been shown to be a
principal electron donor to the ribonucleotide reductases,
and in many organisms inhibition of this system prevents
the biosynthesis of the necessary deoxyribonucleotides
for d n a synthesis [5, 6]. consequently, the inhibition of
the t r by  xxxd269xxx  (ki = 1.25 x 10 .5 m) may have
the dual effect of depigmentation and also cytostatic activity by preventing d n a synthesis [22]. a most important aspect o f t r inhibition by  xxxd269xxx  resides in its
reversibility. when the drug has been removed, normal
pigmentation and d n a synthesis occurs [9]. a reason
for this reversibility has been confirmed by using 14clabelled  xxxd269xxx  and by demonstrating the formation
of a putative thioester on the thiolate active site of this
enzyme [22]. in this report, we compare the relative contributions made by  xxxd269xxx  in the depigmentation
process either by its direct action on tyrosinase, or by its
indirect action on tr.

methods

mushroom tyrosinase and all other reagents were obtained from
sigma chemical, st. louis, mo, usa. kinetic experiments were
performed on a lambda 3 uv/vis spectrophotometer (perkin
elmer) at 25~ mushroom tyrosinase was assayed at 280 nm by
measuring the formation of dopachrome from l-tyrosine in 0.1 m
hepes buffer at ph 6.5 [3]. reaction mixtures contained 0.3 ml of
7 x i 0 - ~m l-tyrosine,0.3 ml 0.1 m hepes buffer ph 6.5, and 0.3 ml
distilled water. this was controlled by a blank containing 0.3 ml
5 • 10 3 m tyrosine, 0.3 ml 0.1 m hepes buffer, and 0.4 ml distilled
water. reactions were started by adding 0.1 ml tyrosinase (0.5 mg/
ml). the increase in extinction at 280 nm was followed in the presence and absence of  xxxd269xxx  and other saturated dicarboxylic

acids. catecholase activity was measured under identical conditions
except that 5 x 10-3 m catechol was used and the formation of
orthoquinone product was measured at 300 nm [11].
results

other saturated dicarbocylic acids (c6--c12) have been
shown to function as depigmenting agents [13, 14], inhibitors of d n a synthesis [9], and inhibitors of t r [22].
dodecandioic acid (c12) has been more inhibitory than
 xxxd269xxx  (c9), which in turn was more inhibitory than
adipic acid (c6). figure 1 shows the effect of 5 x l0 -2 m
adipic acid (c6),  xxxd269xxx  (c9), and dodecandioic acid
(c~ 2) on the rate o f the tyrosinase reaction. under identical reaction conditions, the different dicarboxylic acids
were added upon the attainment of linear control kinetics
(i. e., 1.5 min), adipic acid was the least inhibitory, while
dodecandioic acid was the most inhibitory for the three
dicarboxylic acids tested.
the lineweaver-burke plot presented in fig. 2 shows
that  xxxd269xxx  and its monomethyl ester are competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase when l-tyrosine is the substrate. f r o m this kinetic data, the k~ for  xxxd269xxx 
(2.73 x 10- ~ m) was one-half the concentration of the k~
for  xxxd269xxx  monomethyl ester (5.24 x 10- 3 m). these
results show that inhibition o f tyrosinase by these saturated carboxylic acids depends on the concentration of
free carboxylate groups in solution when l-tyrosine is
the substrate. when catechol was used as an alternative
substrate to l-tyrosine, then 5 x 1 0 - 2 m  xxxd269xxx  or
 xxxd269xxx  monomethyl ester did not inhibit the oxidation o f 5 x 1 0 - 3 m catechol to orthoquinone, indicating that this saturated  xxxd2537xxx  only inhibits
tyrosinase when l-tyrosine is the substrate.

of tyrosinase confirms the reversibility o f these saturated

dicarboxylic acids as competitive inhibitors of this enzyme as previously reported by nazzaro-porro et al. [13,
14]. our experiments with  xxxd269xxx  monomethyl ester
and with the alternate substrate catechol extend this work
and indicate a mechanism for competitive inhibition of
tyrosinase. the utilization of the monomethyl ester as
inhibitor suggests a mechanism involving competition
between freely dissociated carboxylate groups on these
inhibitors for the l-tyrosine e-carboxylate group binding
site in the active site of tyrosinase. this binding site is
most likely a basic amino acid residue capable of forming
a freely dissociable "iron pair" between a negatively
charged amino acid residue (i. e., either lysine, arginine,
or histidine). this interaction would explain the poor
affinity between  xxxd269xxx  and tyrosinase reflected in a
ki of 2.73 x 10 .3 m. therefore, in order for  xxxd269xxx 
to exert its depigmenting function, at least 10 .3 m concentration of this inhibitor must permeate melanosomes
to have a direct effect on tyrosinase (fig. 3). previous
experiments with radioactive dodecandioic acid, a more
potent inhibitor than  xxxd269xxx , failed to detect any
significant radiolabeling of melanosomes [1]. this result
indicated that melanosomes cannot accumulate 10-3 m
concentrations of these dicarboxylic acids and suggested
an alternative pathway for the inhibition of melanin biosynthesis.
recently, it has been shown that  xxxd269xxx  inhibits
membrane-associated t r by a reversible mechanism [22]
(/s = 1.25 x 10-5 m). this inhibition occurs with a 200fold lower concentration of saturated  xxxd2537xxx 
than that demonstrated on tyrosinase (fig. 3). an indirect effect caused by the inhibition of free radical re-

fig. 3.  xxxd269xxx  may inhibit tyrosinase directly kx= (2.73
x 10-3m) or indirectly by inhibiting free radical reduction on
plasma membrane associated  xxxg1826xxx  (tr; ki=
1.25x10-sm). under these conditions electrons flow from
nadph to reduce intracellular thioredoxin. reduced thioredoxin
inhibits tyrosinase by forming a bis-cysteinateinhibitors complex [32]
duction by membrane-associated thioredoxin leading to
an increased intracellular concentration of reduced
thioredoxin with concomitant inhibition of tyrosinase,
provides a more plausible mechanism for the depigmenting property of  xxxd269xxx  (fig. 3).
a proposal for the mechanism of action of  xxxd269xxx 
acid is presented in fig. 3. in this scheme,  xxxd532xxx  phosphate (nadph),
produced in the cytosol from glucose metabolism (glycolysis), transfers electrons to plasma membrane-associated tr. reduced t r can transfer electrons either to uvgenerated r" outside the cell or to oxidized thioredoxin in
the cytosol. when  xxxd269xxx  inhibits the reduction of
extracellular r', electrons flow in the direction of oxidized
thioredoxin to increase the intracellular concentration
of reduced thioredoxin. reduced thioredoxin has been
shown to readily transport through membranes of
organelles and to be a potent inhibitor of tyrosinase [32]
thus preventing melanin biosynthesis. more than 200fold the concentration of  xxxd269xxx  is required to inhibit
tyrosinase directly compared with the extracellular concentration of  xxxd269xxx  necessary to block free radical
reduction by tr.
one very important aspect of the inhibition of t r by
 xxxd269xxx  deserves mention here. it has been shown
