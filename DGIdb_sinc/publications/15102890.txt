teins such as scavenger receptor class b type i ( xxxg2013xxx ) and
 xxxg9xxx  plays an important role in cellular and whole body
lipid metabolism and can profoundly influence the risk
of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (1–8). the
pathologic consequences of naturally arising or experimentally induced disruptions in the  xxxg2013xxx  and  xxxg9xxx 
genes clearly demonstrate that these lipid transport proteins serve physiologically important, yet dramatically distinct, purposes in hdl metabolism (1, 2).
 xxxg2013xxx , a member of the cd36 superfamily of proteins,
is a 509 residue glycoprotein (apparent mass of 82 kda)
containing two predicted transmembrane helices adjacent
to very short n- and c-terminal cytoplasmic domains, with
the bulk of the protein consisting of a large extracellular
loop (3, 4). alterations in  xxxg2013xxx  expression can influence
profoundly several physiologic processes, including biliary
cholesterol secretion, female fertility, red blood cell maturation, and the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (5–7, 9–14).  xxxg2013xxx  tightly binds large,
spherical, cholesteryl ester-rich hdl particles, primarily
via its major apolipoprotein,  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg1335xxx -i),
but lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i is a poor ligand (15).  xxxg2013xxx  mediates
the selective uptake of hdl cholesteryl esters (16–19)
and other lipids (3, 20, 21) into cells, after which the lipiddepleted particles dissociate from the cells. the mechanism of selective lipid uptake differs markedly from that
of the classic coated pit-mediated endocytic uptake of ldl
receptors (22). the binding of native spherical hdl par-

abstract scavenger receptor class b type i ( xxxg2013xxx ) and
 xxxg9xxx  are structurally dissimilar cell surface proteins that
play key roles in hdl metabolism.  xxxg2013xxx  is a receptor that
binds hdl with high affinity and mediates both the selective lipid uptake of cholesteryl esters from lipid-rich hdl
to cells and the efflux of unesterified cholesterol from cells
to hdl.  xxxg9xxx  mediates the efflux of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipid-poor  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg1335xxx -i). the activities of  xxxg9xxx  and other
atp binding cassette superfamily members are inhibited by
the drug  xxxd2215xxx , and  xxxg2013xxx -mediated lipid transport is
blocked by small molecule inhibitors called blts . here, we
show that one blt, [1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-3-naphthalen-2-ylurea] (blt-4), blocked  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux
to lipid-poor  xxxg1335xxx -i at a potency similar to that for its inhibition of  xxxg2013xxx  (ic50  55–60 m). reciprocally,  xxxd2215xxx 
blocked  xxxg2013xxx -mediated selective lipid uptake and efflux
at a potency similar to that for its inhibition of  xxxg9xxx  (ic50
275–300 m). as is the case with blts,  xxxd2215xxx  increased the apparent affinity of hdl binding to  xxxg2013xxx .
the reciprocal inhibition of  xxxg2013xxx  and  xxxg9xxx  by blt-4
and  xxxd2215xxx  raises the possibility that these proteins may
share similar or common steps in their mechanisms of lipid
transport.—nieland, t. j. f., a. chroni, m. l. fitzgerald, z.

that in the low nanomolar to micromolar range block
lipid transport (selective uptake from and efflux to hdl)
mediated by  xxxg2013xxx  (45). unexpectedly, they enhance
rather than decrease the apparent affinity of hdl binding to  xxxg2013xxx .
here, we report that 1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-3-naphthalen-2-yl-urea (blt-4) (fig. 1b) blocks  xxxg9xxx -mediated
cholesterol efflux to lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i. the other blts did
not inhibit  xxxg9xxx  activity. conversely,  xxxd2215xxx  prevented  xxxg2013xxx -mediated selective lipid uptake from and
cholesterol efflux to hdl. similar to the blts,  xxxd2215xxx 
enhanced the affinity of hdl binding to  xxxg2013xxx . the
concentrations at which  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited  xxxg2013xxx - and
 xxxg9xxx -mediated lipid efflux were similar (ic50  275–
300 m), as were those for blt-4, but blt-4 was the more
potent inhibitor (ic50  55–60 m). the reciprocal or
cross-inhibition of these two lipid transport proteins by
blt-4 and  xxxd2215xxx  raises the possibility that there may
be similarities in at least one step of the mechanisms of
 xxxg2013xxx - and  xxxg9xxx -mediated lipid transport

experimental procedures
stock solutions of blts (chembridge corp.) and  xxxd2215xxx 
(sigma) were prepared in 100% dmso and diluted into the assay medium immediately before use. dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (dsp; from pierce biotechnology, inc.), which contains
thiol-sensitive bonds, was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  and
then diluted to 250 m with pbs immediately before use.

lipoproteins and cells
human hdl (density of 1.09–1.16 g/ml) and recombinant
lipid-free human  xxxg1335xxx -i were isolated and labeled with either
125 i ( 125 i-hdl or 125 i- xxxg1335xxx -i) or [ 3 h]cholesteryl oleyl ether
([3h]coe, [3h]coe-hdl) (3, 19, 25, 44, 57, 58). ldl receptordeficient chinese hamster ovary cells that express low levels of endogenous  xxxg2013xxx  (ldla-7) (59), ldla-7 cells stably transfected to express high levels of murine  xxxg2013xxx  (ldla[msr-bi]) (19), and hek293ebna-t human embryonic kidney (hek) cells (27) were maintained in culture as previously described. all assay media contained
0.5% or 0.29% (v/v) dmso and 0.5% (w/v) bsa (fatty acid-free
form in efflux assays), and all experiments were conducted at 37c.

ticles or reconstituted  xxxg1335xxx -i/phospholipid/cholesterol
disks to  xxxg2013xxx  also results in the efflux of unesterified cholesterol from cells to the particles (23–25), but the physiological significance of this activity has not yet been determined.
 xxxg9xxx , a member of the atp binding cassette (abc)
superfamily of proteins, has a structure strikingly different
from that of  xxxg2013xxx .  xxxg9xxx  is a much larger protein (200
kda) that contains 12 membrane-spanning helices, two cytoplasmic atp binding domains, and two large extracellular loops (2, 26, 27). it mediates the transfer of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipidpoor  xxxg1335xxx -i (28–31), which can subsequently mature into
spherical, cholesteryl ester-rich hdl particles (32–35).
these mature hdls are poor acceptors for  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux (36). mutations in  xxxg9xxx  are the
underlying cause of  xxxg9xxx , which is characterized by the virtual absence of spherical, cholesteryl esterrich hdl particles in the plasma and an accumulation of
cholesterol in peripheral macrophages (28, 37–39). mice
with targeted homozygous inactivating mutations in the
 xxxg9xxx  gene exhibit phenotypes similar to those of human tangier patients (40–42). in contrast,  xxxg2013xxx -deficient
mice (homozygous null mutations) have increased levels
of abnormally large lipid-rich hdl particles in their
plasma (43). the differences in the structures of  xxxg2013xxx 
and  xxxg9xxx  suggest that they use different mechanisms to
transfer lipids between cells and hdl. this is supported
by experiments showing that the structural or conformational determinants on  xxxg1335xxx -i that are crucial for its interaction with  xxxg9xxx  (e.g.,  xxxg1335xxx -i’s c terminus) appear to
differ from those necessary for productive interactions
with  xxxg2013xxx  (15, 24, 44). however, their common abilities
to mediate cholesterol efflux from cells led us to probe
their activities using small molecules that had previously
been shown to inhibit their lipid transport activities.
these included small molecules that block lipid transport
(blts) mediated by  xxxg2013xxx  (45) and the drug  xxxd2215xxx 
(29, 31, 46–51), which blocks  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux.
 xxxd2215xxx  (also called  xxxd2215xxx ; fig. 1a) is a sulfonylurea that has received wide attention in clinical settings
as a potent drug for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (52).  xxxd2215xxx  binds tightly to and
inhibits sulfonylurea receptors 1 and 2 ( xxxg19xxx  or  xxxg20xxx ),
members of the abc superfamily of proteins that form
the sur subunit of the atp-sensitive  xxxg1232xxx .
 xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  are responsible for the binding and hydrolysis of atp and effectively control the closing of the
channel and the regulation of insulin release. the dissociation constant (kd) for  xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx , which
apparently involves association with its transmembrane
domains, is in the low nanomolar range [reviewed in ref.
(53)].  xxxd2215xxx  also inhibits the activities of other abc
proteins (54–56), including  xxxg9xxx . inhibition of  xxxg9xxx 
by  xxxd2215xxx  has been reported to occur in the concentration range of 100–1,000 m (29, 31, 46–51).
by using a high-throughput chemical library screen, we
recently identified five small molecules (blt-1 to blt-5)

is defined as the difference between the efflux values determined for incubations in medium that did or did not contain
lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i. the  xxxg9xxx - and  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent efflux is
defined as the difference between the  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent efflux
values determined using cells that express the  xxxg9xxx  transgene
(hek[ xxxg9xxx ]) and the empty vector controls (hek[control]).
efflux values are presented as the percentage of total cellular
1,2[3h]cholesterol present in the cells at the beginning of the 4 h
incubation.
the ic50 values are those concentrations of the compounds
that caused a half-maximal inhibition of lipid transport mediated
by either  xxxg9xxx  or  xxxg2013xxx .

cross-linking assay of  xxxg1335xxx -i binding to  xxxg9xxx 
the binding assays were conducted as described by wang et
al. (62) with minor modifications. hek293-ebna-t cells were
plated as described above on 12-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates
and 3 days later were transfected with plasmids when the cells
were 95% confluent, as described above. on day 4, the cells
were preincubated in dmem (high glucose) and 0.2% (w/v)
fatty acid-free bsa with the indicated amounts of compounds at
37c for 1 h before incubation at 37c for 1 h with 2 g/ml
125i- xxxg1335xxx -i and the indicated compounds in the presence or
absence of a 30-fold excess of unlabeled  xxxg1335xxx -i. cells were
then washed, reversibly cross-linked with dsp (2 ml/well), and
washed again as previously described (62). for immunoprecipitation, cell lysates prepared in buffer ri [50 mm tris, ph 7.6, 150
mm nacl, 0.25% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 1% nonidet p-40] containing a protease inhibitors mixture (roche molecular biochemicals gmbh), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
were subjected to centrifugation at 1,000 g in a microcentrifuge
for 10 min. the supernatant was collected and precleared with
10 l of gammabind g sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. polyclonal anti- xxxg9xxx  antibody (50 g) directed against the c terminus of  xxxg9xxx  (61) was added to the
preabsorbed cell lysates and incubated with rotation at room
temperature for 2 h. twenty microliters of gammabind g sepharose beads was then added, and the incubation with rotation was
continued at room temperature for 1 h. the samples were subjected to a brief centrifugation, and the pellets were washed
three times with cold buffer ri at room temperature. the bound
proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation and boiling in
laemmli sample buffer in the presence of 5% - xxxd26xxx , which also serves to break the dsp-mediated cross-links between  xxxg1335xxx -i and  xxxg9xxx . the eluted proteins were fractionated
by 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity in the dried gels was analyzed using a phosphorimaging
storm860 system (molecular dynamics, inc., sunnyvale, ca)
and imagequant software.

determination of  xxxg9xxx  expression levels
to determine the effect of the compounds on the cell surface
expression of  xxxg9xxx , we used previously described quantitative
assays for cell surface  xxxg9xxx  that detects a flag tag inserted
in the first large extracellular loop of  xxxg9xxx  (27). in brief,
hek293-ebna-t cells on 24-well plates were transfected with a
flag- xxxg9xxx  cdna or empty vectors as described above. the
media containing dna and lipofectamine were removed 1 day
after transfection, and 1 day later the cells were exposed for 5 h
at 37c to assay medium [dmem (high glucose) supplemented
with 0.2% fatty acid-free bsa, 0.5% dmso, and 25 mm hepes,
ph 7.4] with or without 150 m blt-4 or 500 m  xxxd2215xxx . the
cells were then chilled on ice for 10 min, and cell surface
 xxxg9xxx -flag expression was measured as described by fitzgerald et al. (27).

all data presented are representative of results from two or
more independent experiments.
 xxxg2013xxx . assays for the uptake of [3h]coe from [3h]coehdl, efflux of [3h]cholesterol from labeled cells, and 125i-hdl
binding were performed using ldla[msr-bi] cells and control
untransfected ldla-7 cells as previously described (19, 23, 25).
we also determined the  xxxg2013xxx -mediated efflux of [3h]cholesterol from hek293-ebna-t cells transiently transfected with an
 xxxg2013xxx  expression plasmid (19), as described for  xxxg9xxx  below.
on the day of the assay, cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37c in
assay medium (ham’s f12, 0.5% bsa, 0.5% dmso, and 25 mm
hepes, ph 7.4) containing compounds at the indicated concentrations. subsequently, the cells were incubated for an additional
2 h with the same concentration of small molecules and with the
indicated concentrations of 125i-hdl (binding), [3h]coe-hdl
(uptake), or unlabeled hdl (efflux). 125i-hdl saturation binding assays were performed as previously described, in which a 40fold excess of unlabeled hdl was included in some of the incubations to permit the correction for nonspecific binding (19,
45). analysis of saturation binding curves was performed using
graphpad prism3 software from graphpad software, inc. (san
diego, ca).
for some experiments, the values presented were normalized
so that 100% of control represents activity in the absence of compounds. in figs. 2 and 3b, 0% activity was defined as the activity
determined in the presence of a 1:800 dilution of the anti- xxxg2013xxx 
blocking antibody kkb-1 (25), a generous gift from karen kozarsky. in other experiments, the 0% values were defined as the
amount of activity either in ldla-7 control cells in the presence of
drugs (fig. 4c) or in ldla[msr-bi] cells in the presence of a
40-fold excess of unlabeled hdl (fig. 5). the amount of cellassociated [3h]coe is expressed as the equivalent amount of
[3h]coe-hdl protein (nanograms) to permit direct comparison of the relative amounts of 125i-hdl binding and [3h]coe
uptake (60).
 xxxg9xxx .  xxxg9xxx -dependent efflux of [3h]cholesterol was
measured using hek293-ebna-t cells transiently transfected
with either an  xxxg9xxx  pcdna1 expression vector or the empty
pcdna1 vector control, as previously described (44, 61). on day
0, hek293-ebna-t cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well on 24well poly-d-lysine-coated plates (becton dickinson) in medium a
[dmem containing high glucose and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum
without antibiotics]. on day 1, cells were transfected with either
the  xxxg9xxx  vector or an “empty” vector control using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
suggestions. the media were removed 16 h later, and cells were
incubated for 24 h in medium a supplemented with 0.5 ci/ml
1,2[3h]cholesterol (perkin-elmer). the cells were then washed
twice with dmem (high glucose) and incubated for 1 h in assay
medium [dmem (high glucose) supplemented with 0.2% fatty
acid-free bsa, 0.5% dmso, and 25 mm hepes, ph 7.4]. the
cells were then pretreated with the indicated concentrations of
small molecules in the assay medium for 1 h at 37c and then incubated with the same concentrations of compounds in the presence or absence of 10 g/ml lipid-free recombinant human
 xxxg1335xxx -i for an additional 4 h to permit the efflux of cellular cholesterol. the supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation (5 min, 6,000 g), the cells were lysed in 0.1 m naoh, and
radioactivity in both fractions was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
cholesterol efflux was defined as the amount of radioactivity
in the extracellular media at the end of the 4 h incubation divided by the total amount of cellular radioactivity in the media
plus cells (the percentage efflux). the  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent efflux

total cellular  xxxg9xxx  expression was measured by immunoblot
analysis using a polyclonal antibody as previously described (61).
transfected cells were treated for 5 h at 37c with 500 m  xxxd2215xxx 
or 150 m blt-4 in assay medium [dmem (high glucose) supplemented with 0.2% fatty acid-free bsa, 0.5% dmso, and 25 mm
hepes, ph 7.4] and subsequently lysed in a hypotonic buffer (250
mm sucrose, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, and 1 mm edta) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mini-cocktail containing edta
(roche). nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation
(800 g for 10 min). the amount of protein was measured in the
postnuclear supernatants by the method of bradford (63) and 15
g of each sample were separated by 6% sds-page and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. the membranes were processed for
antibody staining, and  xxxg9xxx  was detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (pierce) as previously described (61).

synthesis of blt-4
naphthyl isocyanate (sigma-aldrich) was dissolved in ethyl
acetate and n-methyl-pyrrolidinone (sigma-aldrich) and then
cooled to 0c. 2-anisidine was added drop-wise by syringe over
10 min. solid naphthyl isocyanate (1.00 g, 5.92 mmol) was dissolved in 45 ml of anhydrous 1:2 n-methyl pyrrolidinone-ethyl
acetate (acros organics) under a nitrogen atmosphere and
cooled to 0c. 2-anisidine (900 l, 7.32 mmol) was added dropwise by syringe over 10 min and the reaction was stirred, first at
0c for 2 h and then for an additional 2 h at room temperature.
the reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 ml of 0.1 n
hcl and extracted three times with 50 ml of dichloromethane.
the pooled organic fractions were dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, concentrated by rotary evaporation, and purified by flash chromatography using silica gel 60 (emd pharmaceuticals) equilibrated in 2:1 (v/v) hexane-ethyl acetate. blt-4
was eluted with 1:1 (v/v) hexane-ethyl acetate and lyophilized
with a final yield of 22%. the product was more than 95% pure
as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and
nmr spectroscopy. the 1h-nmr resonance frequencies for blt-4
are as follows: (d6 -me2so):  3.89 (3h, s), 6.90 (1h, td, j  1.5

results and discussion
effects of blts on  xxxg9xxx -mediated [3h]cholesterol
efflux to  xxxg1335xxx -i
to determine if  xxxg2013xxx - and  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux share common features, we examined the ef-

fig. 2. effects of blts on  xxxg9xxx - and scavenger receptor class b
type i ( xxxg2013xxx )-dependent efflux of [3h]cholesterol to extracellular
acceptors. hek293-ebna-t cells were transiently transfected with
either an  xxxg9xxx  expression vector or the control pcdna1 vector.
one day after transfection, the cells were labeled for 24 h with
[3h]cholesterol and then preincubated for 1 h at 37c in assay medium containing 0.5% (v/v) dmso with or without the indicated
concentrations of blts. after the preincubation, the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37c with the same concentrations
of blts in the presence or absence of 10 g/ml lipid-free recombinant human  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg1335xxx -i) to measure cholesterol efflux. the amounts of [3h]cholesterol transferred from the cells to
the medium and the values for  xxxg9xxx - and  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent efflux were determined as described in experimental procedures
(closed bars). the control efflux values (percentage of cellular cholesterol released into the medium) measured in the absence of
blts were as follows: hek[ xxxg9xxx ] with  xxxg1335xxx -i, 7.4%; hek
[ xxxg9xxx ] without  xxxg1335xxx -i, 4%; hek[control] with  xxxg1335xxx -i, 1.7%;
hek[control] without  xxxg1335xxx -i, 1%. the 100% control value determined in the absence of blts for  xxxg9xxx - and  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent efflux was 2.7% [calculated as (7.4-4)(1.7-1)%]. error bars represent the range of duplicate determinations. in independent
experiments,  xxxg2013xxx -mediated and hdl-dependent [ 3h]cholesterol
efflux was determined in [ 3h]cholesterol-labeled ldla[msr-bi]
cells (open bars). cells were preincubated with the indicated
amounts of blts for 1 h and then incubated for 2 h at 37c with
500 g of protein per milliliter of hdl and the same concentrations of blts in the presence or absence of a 1:800 dilution of the
anti- xxxg2013xxx  blocking antibody kkb-1 (25). the 100% of control
value represents efflux in the absence of compound (50% of initial
cellular radiolabeled cholesterol for efflux to hdl), and the 0% of
control value represents efflux in the presence of hdl and the
kkb-1 antibody (1:800 dilution) (12% of initial cellular radiolabeled cholesterol). there was no effect of the compounds on efflux
to hdl in the presence of kkb-1. error bars represent standard deviations from triplicate measurements.

hek, ldla7, and ldla[msr-bi] cells were labeled with [3h]cholesterol as described above for cholesterol efflux assays. after incubation for 5 h with or without 500 m  xxxd2215xxx  or 150 m blt-4,
the cells were lysed (lysis buffer: 50 mm tris, ph 7.6, 150 mm
nacl, 0.25% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , and 1% nonidet p-40) for 30
min at room temperature. a mixture of 2:1 chloroform-methanol
(v/v) containing unlabeled lipids (200 g/l cholesterol and 200
g/l cholesteryl  xxxd2777xxx ) was added to the lysate as an internal
standard. the organic phase of the resulting mixture was evaporated under nitrogen, dissolved in 75 l of chloroform, and fractionated by tlc using itlc sa plates (pal corporation) using
petroleum ether-ether-acetic acid (85:15:1). spots containing cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and origin spots were cut out, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.

fects of blts on  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux from
hek293 cells transiently transfected with either an abca1expression vector (hek[ xxxg9xxx ]) or an empty vector
control (hek[control]).
cholesterol efflux was measured from cells labeled with
unesterified [3h]cholesterol for 24 h, followed by a 1 h
preincubation with the blt. this was followed by a 4 h incubation with the blt in the presence or absence of 10
g of protein per milliliter of lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i, which

the presence of  xxxg1335xxx -i as an acceptor in the incubation
medium. as the concentration of blt-4 increased, there
was a substantial inhibition of efflux from hek[ xxxg9xxx ]
cells incubated with  xxxg1335xxx -i, but there was little or no inhibition of the relatively low background efflux from
hek[ xxxg9xxx ] cells in the absence of  xxxg1335xxx -i or from
hek[control] cells either with or without  xxxg1335xxx -i. figure
3b shows that the  xxxg9xxx - and  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent [3h]
cholesterol efflux, calculated as described in experimental procedures, was inhibited by blt-4 with an ic50 of 60
m. this value is similar to that for its inhibition of sr-bidependent [3h]cholesterol efflux to hdl (ic50  55 m;
fig. 3b) (45).
the shared sensitivities to blt-4 suggest that there may
be similarities in the mechanisms by which blt-4 inhibited  xxxg9xxx - and  xxxg2013xxx -mediated cellular cholesterol efflux. the inability of blt-1, blt-3, and blt-5 to inhibit
 xxxg9xxx  raises the possibility that the mechanisms by which
they block  xxxg2013xxx  activity may differ from that of blt-4, although additional studies will be required to directly address this question.
effects of the  xxxg9xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2215xxx 
on  xxxg2013xxx -mediated [3h]cholesterol efflux to hdl
the inhibition of  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux
by blt-4 prompted us to determine if the  xxxg9xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2215xxx  (29, 31, 46–51) (fig. 1a) could block srbi-mediated [3h]cholesterol efflux to hdl. figure 4
compares the concentration dependence of  xxxd2215xxx ’s
inhibition of  xxxg9xxx -mediated [3h]cholesterol efflux to
 xxxg1335xxx -i (a, c) with its effects on  xxxg2013xxx -mediated [3h]cholesterol efflux to hdl (b, c).
as expected from previous studies (29, 31, 48–50),  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited  xxxg9xxx -mediated [3h]cholesterol efflux
from hek[ xxxg9xxx ] cells to  xxxg1335xxx -i (10 g protein/ml)
with an ic50 of 300 m (fig. 4a), and it had little effect
on the low background efflux in the absence of  xxxg9xxx 
transgene expression, in the absence of  xxxg1335xxx -i, or both.
this ic50 value is substantially greater than that for blt-4
(60 m). thus, blt-4 was a more potent inhibitor of
 xxxg9xxx  than was  xxxd2215xxx .
strikingly,  xxxd2215xxx ’s effects on  xxxg2013xxx -mediated efflux
were virtually identical to those on  xxxg9xxx -mediated efflux. figure 4b shows that  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited  xxxg2013xxx -mediated [3h]cholesterol efflux from ldla[msr-bi] cells to
hdl (500 g protein/ml) with a ic50 of 275 m, and it
had little effect on the low background efflux in the absence of  xxxg2013xxx  transgene expression (ldla-7 control cells),
in the absence of hdl, or both. figure 4c, which compares directly  xxxd2215xxx ’s inhibition of  xxxg9xxx - and apoai-dependent cholesterol efflux and its inhibition of sr-biand hdl-dependent cholesterol efflux, shows that the
drug is equally potent in inhibiting these cell surface
transport proteins.
we also found that lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i (10 g protein/ml)
was a poor acceptor of  xxxg2013xxx -mediated [3h]cholesterol efflux compared with hdl (500 g protein/ml) [2% vs.
61%, respectively; also see ref. (36)]. the low level of

hibited by blt-1 (10 m), blt-3 (150 m), or blt-5 (150
m), at concentrations that inhibit  xxxg2013xxx -mediated [3h]
cholesterol efflux to hdl from ldla[msr-bi] cells, a cell
line stably transfected with murine  xxxg2013xxx  (open bars)
(45). at these concentrations, all three blts inhibited
cholesterol efflux to hdl from hek cells transfected with
a cdna construct encoding murine  xxxg2013xxx , indicating that
hek cells are not intrinsically resistant to blt-1, blt-3,
and blt-5 (data not shown). because the structures of
blt-1 and blt-2 are very similar (45), we did not test blt-2
in these studies. in contrast to the other blts, blt-4 (fig.
1b) at a concentration of 150 m inhibited  xxxg9xxx - and
 xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent efflux by 90%, approximately the
same extent of its inhibition of cholesterol efflux observed
for  xxxg2013xxx -mediated efflux to hdl (fig. 2) from transfected ldla-7 (45) or hek293 (data not shown) cells.
figure 3a shows the concentration dependence of
blt-4-mediated inhibition of [3h]cholesterol efflux. hek
[ xxxg9xxx ] and hek[control] cells were labeled with [ 3h]
cholesterol and incubated with or without lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i
and the indicated concentrations of blt-4. as described
previously (28, 29, 44, 61, 64), we found that [3h]cholesterol efflux depended on the expression of  xxxg9xxx  and

of  xxxd2215xxx  interfering with other cellular processes, including features of cellular cholesterol metabolism. we
were unable to detect  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition of cholesterol
esterification (thin layer chromatographic assay) or of the
total cellular cholesterol levels in either hek cells or
ldla[msr-bi] cells loaded with [3h]cholesterol (data not
shown). thus, at least some aspects of cellular cholesterol
metabolism appear to be unaffected by high-dose  xxxd2215xxx  treatment under the conditions used in these experiments. we previously have shown that blt-4 is a relatively specific inhibitor in that it does not affect multiple
membrane transport processes, such as clathrin-dependent endocytosis, lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis, and
the protein secretory pathway, nor does it have a detectable impact on the integrity of the actin and microtubular
networks (45). as was the case with  xxxd2215xxx , blt-4 did
not appear to inhibit cholesterol esterification or to alter
total cellular cholesterol levels in either hek cells or
ldla[msr-bi] cells loaded with [3h]cholesterol (data not
shown).

ldla[msr-bi] and untransfected ldla-7 control cells (2%)
was insensitive to  xxxd2215xxx  (data not shown). it is thus unlikely that  xxxd2215xxx ’s ability to affect  xxxg2013xxx ’s activity
has complicated the interpretation of previous studies
of  xxxg9xxx  activity, because those studies used lipid-free
 xxxg1335xxx -i as an acceptor of  xxxd2215xxx -sensitive cholesterol efflux.
we and others have found that the concentration of  xxxd2215xxx  required to inhibit  xxxg9xxx  is substantially higher
than its reported in vitro ki for other abc proteins, such
as  xxxg19xxx /2 [reviewed in ref. (53)]. it is possible that the
inhibition of  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux by  xxxd2215xxx  is a secondary consequence of high concentrations

2 when ldla[msr-bi] or ldla7 cells were treated with a very high
concentration of  xxxd2215xxx  (1 mm) for a total of 3 h, we observed morphological changes (e.g., changes in the appearance of the nucleus)
and occasionally signs of toxicity as measured by trypan blue exclusion.
3  xxxd2215xxx  at a concentration of 1 mm has been reported to prevent specific  xxxg9xxx - and  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine) efflux from cells, determined as the difference in phospholipid efflux from  xxxg9xxx -expressing cells measured in the presence
and absence of  xxxg1335xxx -i in the extracellular medium (29). we also observed this inhibition at very high doses of  xxxd2215xxx  (500 m and
higher). however, we found in our experiments that the glyburideinduced decrease in specific  xxxg1335xxx -i-dependent phospholipid efflux was
largely attributable to an increase in  xxxg9xxx -mediated efflux to the
 xxxg1335xxx -i-free medium rather than to a substantial decrease in efflux to
the  xxxg1335xxx -i containing medium (data not shown).

[3h]cholesterol efflux from hek[ xxxg9xxx ] (closed symbols) or
hek[control] (open symbols) cells was determined in the presence (squares) or absence (triangles) of 10 g/ml lipid-free recombinant human  xxxg1335xxx -i and the indicated concentrations of
 xxxd2215xxx  as described in experimental procedures. b: [ 3h]cholesterol efflux from  xxxg2013xxx -expressing ldla[msr-bi] (closed symbols)
or control ldla-7 (open symbols) cells was determined in the presence (circles) or absence (triangles) of 500 g of protein per milliliter of hdl and the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx  as
described in the legend to fig. 3b. c:  xxxg9xxx -mediated and  xxxg1335xxx -idependent [3h]cholesterol efflux (closed squares) was calculated
from the data in a as described in experimental procedures. sr-bimediated and hdl-dependent [3h]cholesterol efflux (open circles)
was calculated from the data in b. efflux to hdl in ldla[msr-bi]
cells in the absence of compound, and in ldla-7 cells in the presence of compound, was used to set the 100% and 0% of control
values, respectively. there was a small, kkb-1-inhibitable effect of
 xxxd2215xxx  on cholesterol efflux to hdl in ldla-7 cells, which represents the efflux mediated by the low levels of endogenous  xxxg2013xxx 
that is expressed in these cells.

effects of  xxxd2215xxx  on  xxxg2013xxx -mediated [3h]coe uptake
from [3h]coe-hdl and 125i-hdl binding
previous studies have shown a close relationship between  xxxg2013xxx -mediated binding to hdl with both sr-bimediated cholesterol efflux to hdl and selective lipid uptake from hdl (24, 57, 65–68). we tested the effects of
 xxxd2215xxx  on these two additional activities of  xxxg2013xxx . figure 5 shows that  xxxd2215xxx  suppressed  xxxg2013xxx -mediated
[3h]coe uptake from [3h]coe-hdl by ldla[msr-bi]
cells (ic50  150 m). flow cytometric analysis of the surface expression of  xxxg2013xxx  established that the effects of  xxxd2215xxx  (at concentrations of 500 m) on  xxxg2013xxx ’s activities were not attributable to a reduction in the steady-state
level of  xxxg2013xxx  on the cell surface (data not shown).2 thus,
 xxxd2215xxx  inhibited both lipid transport activities of  xxxg2013xxx ,
selective uptake and cholesterol efflux, as is the case for
the blts (45).3
blts 1–5 increase the affinity of 125i-hdl binding to
 xxxg2013xxx  at 37c (lower apparent kd) (45). the decreased
apparent kd values are attributable, at least in part, to
decreased dissociation rates and are not accompanied
by substantially altered maximal binding values. figure
5 shows that increasing concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx  in-

creased the binding of 125i-hdl (10 g protein/ml) to
ldla[msr-bi] cells in a manner that was correlated inversely with its inhibition of lipid transport (figs. 4 and 5).
the increased binding of 125i-hdl to  xxxg2013xxx  observed at a
subsaturating concentration of 125i-hdl appeared to be
attributable, at least in part, to a  xxxd2215xxx -induced increase in the affinity of  xxxg2013xxx  for 125i-hdl without a substantial change in the maximal binding values (fig. 6).
for the 125i-hdl concentrations used in these experiments [a relatively broad density range (23)], the apparent kd values were 26.2
3.7 g protein/ml in the absence of  xxxd2215xxx  and 4.7
0.7 g protein/ml in the
presence of 250 m  xxxd2215xxx . thus, the effects of the
 xxxg9xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2215xxx  on  xxxg2013xxx ’s activities were similar to the activities of the blts: increased hdl binding
and decreased lipid transport.
effects of blt-4 and  xxxd2215xxx  on  xxxg1335xxx -i binding
to  xxxg9xxx 
the increase in affinity of  xxxg2013xxx  for hdl induced by
blt-4 [see also ref. (45)] and  xxxd2215xxx  prompted us to
examine the binding of  xxxg1335xxx -i to  xxxg9xxx . figure 7 shows
a representative assay that involved incubating abca1expressing cells with 125i- xxxg1335xxx -i, treating the cells with a
cleavable cross-linking agent (dsp), immunoprecipitating
cross-linked complexes with anti- xxxg9xxx  antiserum, and
then detecting the coprecipitated 125i- xxxg1335xxx -i after breaking the cross-links and fractionating the samples by sdspage (62). as expected, there was no detectable binding
of 125i- xxxg1335xxx -i to control cells transfected with empty vector (no  xxxg9xxx ). both  xxxd2215xxx  [250–1,000 m; see also
ref. (62)] and blt-4 (150 m) effectively blocked the
binding of 125i- xxxg1335xxx -i to  xxxg9xxx  at concentrations that inhibit  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux to  xxxg1335xxx -i (figs.
1262

2–4). we did not detect a decrease in either the cell surface levels or the total protein levels of  xxxg9xxx  in cells
treated under similar conditions with either compound
(data not shown). thus,  xxxd2215xxx  and blt-4 inhibition of
125i- xxxg1335xxx -i binding to  xxxg9xxx  cannot be explained by decreases in either cell surface or total levels of  xxxg9xxx . the
inhibition of  xxxg1335xxx -i binding to  xxxg9xxx  by  xxxd2215xxx  and
blt-4 contrasts their abilities to enhance the affinity of
hdl binding to  xxxg2013xxx .
it is possible that the reciprocal inhibition of  xxxg2013xxx  and
 xxxg9xxx  by the structurally distinct small molecules blt-4
and  xxxd2215xxx  was simply a coincidence of multiple independent activities of these compounds. an alternative,
more appealing explanation is that, despite the very different structures and physiologic functions of  xxxg2013xxx  and

vector (no  xxxg9xxx ). one day after transfection, the cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37c in assay medium with the indicated concentrations of blt-4 or  xxxd2215xxx . the binding of 125i- xxxg1335xxx -i (2
g/ml, 1 h, 37c) in the presence or absence of a 30-fold excess of
unlabeled  xxxg1335xxx -i and the indicated concentrations of inhibitors
was measured using a dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) crosslinking assay as described in experimental methods. bound 125iapoa-i was fractionated by sds-page and detected in the gels using a phosphorimaging storm860 system (top), and the relative
amounts of 125i- xxxg1335xxx -i in the lanes were determined using imagequant software (bottom). values shown in the lower portion of
the figure are representative of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. error bars represent the ranges of duplicate
determinations.

 xxxg9xxx , some features of their mechanisms of lipid transport may have similarities or even share common steps
that are sensitive to blt-4 and  xxxd2215xxx . this explanation
is supported by the observation that the potencies (ic50)
for  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition of  xxxg2013xxx  and  xxxg9xxx  are virtually
identical, as they are for blt-4.
the molecular targets of blt-4 and  xxxd2215xxx  responsible for their inhibition of  xxxg2013xxx - and  xxxg9xxx -mediated
lipid transport activities have not yet been identified, and
they need not be the same. however, these lipid transport
proteins themselves are obvious candidates.  xxxd2215xxx 
and blt-4 might bind to either the same or distinct sites
on each protein. it is also possible that the direct targets
of these inhibitors are not the transporters themselves
but rather some other protein(s) or lipids (e.g., a specific
membrane domain). it is noteworthy that, even though
the structures of  xxxd2215xxx  and blt-4 (with the exception
of the methoxyphenyl and the urea functionalities) differ
(fig. 1), they both can inhibit the activities of several abc
proteins. blt-4 inhibits ethidium bromide efflux from
staphylococcus aureus mediated by nora, a member of the
abc superfamily (69), as well as  xxxg9xxx  activity (this
study).  xxxd2215xxx , which was originally identified as a
drug that binds to and inhibits the abc subunit (sur) of
the atp-sensitive k atp channels, can interfere with pathways involving the abc proteins cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (54),  xxxg11xxx  (56),
and multidrug resistance p-glycoprotein (55), as well as
 xxxg9xxx  (29, 31, 46–51). it is possible that the target of the
inhibitory activities of both drugs could be a cell surface
or intracellular  xxxg22xxx (s) other than  xxxg9xxx 
that may directly or indirectly influence lipid transport
mechanisms mediated by both  xxxg2013xxx  and  xxxg9xxx .
despite the similar abilities of either  xxxd2215xxx  or blt-4
to inhibit lipid transport mediated by  xxxg9xxx  and  xxxg2013xxx ,
there are several striking differences in the mechanisms
by which these transporters function. lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i
binds preferentially to  xxxg9xxx , and along with pre- xxxg1335xxx -i
it is the preferred cholesterol acceptor from  xxxg9xxx  relative to spherical, lipid-rich hdl particles (32–36). in contrast, spherical, lipid-rich hdl particles are the preferred
ligands for  xxxg2013xxx  (15). the effects of  xxxd2215xxx  and blt-4
on ligand binding also highlight the differences between
these transporters. both inhibitors block ligand binding
to  xxxg9xxx , whereas they enhance the ligand binding affinity of  xxxg2013xxx . additional studies will be required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the complex effects of
these inhibitors on these key cholesterol transporters.
in summary, we have identified blt-4 as a new and relatively potent inhibitor of  xxxg9xxx . we also show that  xxxd2215xxx  is a heretofore unrecognized inhibitor of  xxxg2013xxx .
the reciprocal inhibition of these transport proteins by
blt-4 and  xxxd2215xxx  raises the possibility that the mechanisms of lipid transport by  xxxg2013xxx  and  xxxg9xxx  might possibly involve another  xxxg22xxx .
