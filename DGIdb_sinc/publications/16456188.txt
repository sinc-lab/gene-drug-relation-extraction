eosinophils are observed to localize to cholinergic nerves in a variety
of inflammatory conditions such as asthma, rhinitis, eosinophilic
gastroenteritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, where they are
also responsible for the induction of cell signaling. we hypothesized
that a consequence of eosinophil localization to cholinergic nerves
would involve a neural remodeling process. eosinophil co-culture
with cholinergic imr32 cells led to increased expression of the m2
muscarinic receptor, with this induction being mediated via an
adhesion-dependent release of eosinophil proteins, including major
basic protein and  xxxg1564xxx . studies on the promoter
sequence of the  xxxg448xxx  indicated that this induction was initiated at a transcription start site 145 kb upstream of the gene-coding
region. this promoter site contains binding sites for a variety of
transcription factors including sp1,  xxxg1222xxx , and ap2. eosinophils also
induced the expression of several cholinergic genes involved in the
synthesis, storage, and metabolism of acetylcholine, including the
enzymes  xxxg440xxx , vesicular acetylcholine transferase, and  xxxg38xxx . the observed eosinophil-induced
changes in enzyme content were associated with a reduction in
intracellular neural acetylcholine but an increase in choline content,
suggesting increased acetylcholine turnover and a reduction in  xxxg38xxx  activity, in turn suggesting reduced catabolism of
acetylcholine. together these data suggest that eosinophil localization to cholinergic nerves induces neural remodeling, promoting a
cholinergic phenotype.

in the airways, parasympathetic nerve stimulation induces acetylcholine release, which leads to mucous secretion and contraction of bronchial smooth muscle. since mucous production and
bronchoconstriction are central features of airway diseases such
as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd),
the parasympathetic nerves may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. there are several key steps in the
synthesis, storage, and release of acetylcholine (ach). acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coa under the
enzymatic action of  xxxg440xxx  (chat). ach is
transported into synaptic vesicles by way of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vacht). once released, ach stimulates
muscarinic receptors on both target organs and the nerves themselves by stimulating m2 muscarinic receptors. m2 muscarinic
receptors function as autoreceptors to limit further ach release.
ach is metabolized into choline and acetate by the action of

 xxxg38xxx  ( xxxg38xxx ). thus, a core group of enzymes
and receptors are responsible for controlling the synthesis, activity, and turnover of ach in cholinergic nerves.
allergic inﬂammation is associated with the release of neurotrophins and other factors that have a direct effect on nerves
(1). one effect of inﬂammatory mediators is that they can alter
neuronal neurotransmitter content; this effect is termed neural
plasticity. neural plasticity is widely described in afferent nerves,
but it is not known if cholinergic nerves are similarly subject to
plasticity. eosinophils are a source of neurotrophins and they
accumulate at cholinergic nerves in human and animal models
of allergic conditions such as asthma, rhinitis, and eosinophilic
gastroenteritis (2–6). thus, one way in which eosinophils may
cause cholinergic nerve cell remodeling is through the release
of  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf). in vitro cell culture studies have
also demonstrated that eosinophil contact with nerves activates
map kinases and other signaling pathways in nerves (9). thus,
eosinophils may inﬂuence nerve function via direct contact as
well as by their released factors (6–9). the genes involved in
the synthesis, control of release, and metabolism of ach are
under the control of a variety of intracellular signaling pathways,
including several protein kinases such as the map kinase family.
therefore, we hypothesized that eosinophil interactions with
nerves may lead to a change in the expression of the genes that
control ach synthesis and metabolism.
to study this hypothesis we employed an established, in vitro,
co-culture model consisting of eosinophils and the human neuroblastoma cell line imr32. this nerve cell line displays a cholinergic
phenotype when differentiated in culture (6, 7). we studied the
effect of puriﬁed eosinophils, eosinophil proteins, and surface
receptors on cholinergic gene expression in this model system. in
addition, we measured the functional activity of the enzymes, the
intracellular acetylcholine content and made preliminary observations as to which aspect of the m2 muscarinic receptor promoter
sequence was responding to eosinophils. the results indicate that
eosinophils promote a cholinergic phenotype, in particular,
through the release of ngf and eosinophil cationic proteins.

eosinophil proteins were prepared as previously described (10).

imr32 nerve cell culture
the human cholinergic neuroblastoma cell line imr32 was depleted
of ﬁbroblasts, as described previously (9). the cells were maintained
in culture in proliferation medium (dmem plus glutamax, 5% fcs,
100 u/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ␮g/ml gentamicin) at 37⬚c in an
atmosphere of 5% co2. on achieving conﬂuence, cells were plated at
a density of 5 ⫻ 105/well in 6-well cell culture dishes and grown in
proliferation medium for 48 h. proliferation media was then replaced
by differentiation medium (dmem plus glutamax, 2% fcs, 2 mm
 xxxd3211xxx , 100 u/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ␮g/ml gentamicin) and cells were used for experimentation after a further 6–7 d of
differentiation in this medium.

eosinophil isolation
eosinophils were prepared from 45 ml of peripheral blood from healthy
human volunteers by a negative immunomagnetic selection technique,
essentially as described previously (6). only populations of eosinophils
which were ⬎ 98% pure and ⬎ 95% viable were used in experimentation. for experimentation purposes 2 ⫻ 105 eosinophils/well were added
to differentiated imr32 cells plated as above in 6-well cell culture
plates.

eosinophil membrane preparation
immediately upon isolation, eosinophils were resuspended in cold, sterile dh2o, incubated on ice for 15 min, then centrifuged at 1,500 ⫻ g
for 10 min at 4⬚c, as described previously (11). this process was repeated twice, and the resulting lysed cell membranes were resuspended
in differentiation medium.

co-culture experiments
prior studies indicated that 2 ⫻ 105/ml of eosinophils was optimal for
transcription factor activation in imr32 cells (9–12); therefore, this
number was used for the current studies. imr32 cells (5 ⫻ 105) were
differentiated for 6–7 d with  xxxd3211xxx  as described above and
then incubated with 2 ⫻ 105 eosinophils for varying time periods from
1–48 h at 37⬚c. in some experiments, imr32 cells were pretreated with
inhibitors of eosinophil adhesion for 30 min or an antibody to nerve
growth factor for 2 h, and co-culture experiments with eosinophils were
performed in the presence or absence of these inhibitors. in other
experiments, imr32 cells were pretreated with eosinophil membranes,
which contain the eosinophil adhesion molecules but not eosinophil
rna nor proteins (9). eosinophil membranes were prepared as described above and were added at a concentration equivalent to 1 ⫻ 105
eosinophils.

nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membrane protein preparation
nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated from imr32 cells, essentially as described in ref. 9. for membrane preparations, cells were
rinsed with pbs and detached with 0.5 mm edta in pbs at 37⬚c.
the detached cells were pelleted at 6,000 rpm for 5 min and suspended
in 100 ␮l buffer a containing 5 mm tris (ph 6.8), 2 mm edta,
and freshly added protease inhibitors (5 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 0.7 ␮g/ml
pepstatin, 5 ␮g/ml  xxxd302xxx , and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuo-

ride) at 4⬚c. the cells were forced through a 22-gauge needle ﬁve to eight
times, and the lysate was spun in a beckman ultracentrifuge (beckman,
krefeld, germany) at 55,000 rpm for 20 min at 4⬚c to collect the membrane pellet. the pellet was resuspended in buffer b containing 20 mm
tris-hcl (ph 6.8), 150 mm nacl, 10 mm edta, 1 mm egta, and
1% triton x-100 with freshly added protease inhibitors (5 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 0.7 ␮g/ml pepstatin, 5 ␮g/ml  xxxd302xxx , and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride) and stored at ⫺80⬚c. protein concentration was established by the bradford method (13) and extracts were stored at ⫺80⬚c.

western blotting
protein extracts (10 ␮g for m2 analysis or 20 ␮g for chat and vacht
analysis) were heated to 95⬚c in sample buffer (100 mm tris ph 6.8,
2% [wt/vol] sds, 0.002% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue, 20% [vol/vol]
glycerol, 10% [vol/vol] ␤- xxxd26xxx ) and separated by sdspage on 10% polyacrylamide separating gel overlaid with 4% stacking
gel at 500 v for 1 h. the separated proteins were transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (20 mm tris, 150 mm glycine, 0.01% [wt/vol] sds, 20% [vol/vol] methanol) at 500 v overnight.
for immunodetection with rabbit anti-human m2 antibody, goat antihuman chat antibody, or rabbit anti-human vacht antibody, membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (dulbecco’s pbs [invitrogen
ltd, paisley, uk] containing 0.2% [wt/vol] i-block and 0.1% [vol/vol]
tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature then incubated for 2 h in
blocking buffer containing the individual respective antibody (1:200 for
each). following six 5-min washes in washing buffer (pbs [sigma] ph
7.4, 0.1% [vol/vol] tween-20) membranes were incubated for 1 h in
blocking buffer containing a dilution of the appropriate anti-goat igg
(chat) (1:10,000) or anti-rabbit igg (m2, vacht) (1:7,500) ap conjugate. membranes were then washed six times for 5 min each and exposed
to cdp star chemiluminescent substrate solution plus nitro-block ii
chemiluminescent substrate compound for ap (19:1) for 5 min at room
temperature. blots were then exposed to x-omat light-sensitive ﬁlm
(kodak, stuttgart, germany) to obtain an image.

mrna analysis
total rna was isolated from the cells with tri reagent, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. for both quantitative lightcycler
pcrs and semiquantitative rt-pcrs, 1 ␮g of total rna was reversetranscribed into cdna using an oligo (dt)15 primer using the ﬁrststrand cdna synthesis system. ampliﬁcation of cdna was performed
by quantitative pcr on the lightcycler using fast start taq dna
polymerase containing the double-stranded dna binding dye sybr
green 1. the samples were continuously monitored during the pcr,
and ﬂuorescence was acquired every 0.1⬚c. pcr mixtures contained 0.5

were denatured at 95⬚c for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of annealing
and extension at 95⬚c for 12 s, 55⬚c for 5 s, and 72⬚c for 8 s (␤-actin,
mnsod, chat), 10 s (m2, vacht), or 6 s ( xxxg38xxx ). characteristic
melting curves were obtained at the end of ampliﬁcation by cooling
the samples to 65⬚c for 15 s followed by further cooling to 40⬚c for 30
s. serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared from known quantities of ␤actin, m2, chat, vacht,  xxxg38xxx , and mnsod pcr products, which
were then used as standards to plot against the unknown samples.
quantiﬁcation of data was analyzed using the lightcycler analysis
software, and values were normalized to the level of ␤-actin expression
for each sample on the same template cdna. in semiquantitative
rt-pcr, the integrity of rna extraction and cdna synthesis was
veriﬁed by pcr by measuring the amounts of ␤-actin cdna in each
sample using ␤-actin–speciﬁc primers (as above). pcr mixtures contained 10⫻ reaction buffer, 2.5 mm mgcl2, 1.25 units of taq polymerase,

durcan, costello, mclean, et al.: eosinophil-mediated nerve remodeling

and 0.2 mm of each dntp. thermocycling conditions for m2 cdna
were 95⬚c for 5 min, 42 cycles of 95⬚c for 1 min, 55⬚c for 1 min, and
72⬚c for 1 min. twenty-nine cycles were used to amplify the more
abundant ␤-actin cdna. a ﬁnal extension step of 72⬚c for 10 min was
followed by resolution of the 211–bp m2 products and the 314–bp
␤-actin products on a 1.5% tris borate-edta agarose gel containing
0.5 ␮g/ml ethidium bromide. m2 pcr products were captured and
quantiﬁed by densitometry using the image master vds-cl and software total lab v1.00.

ach measurements
ach content was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with an enzymatic reactor containing  xxxg38xxx  and choline
oxidase and an electro-chemical detector using a commercial kit (bioanalytical systems, inc., warwickshire, uk) based on the method of potter
(14). protein concentration was determined by the method of bradford
(13). the cells were pre-incubated for 20 min in a choline-free physiologic
salt solution (ph 7.4) consisting of nacl 13 mm, kcl 5 mm, cacl2 1
mm, mgcl2 0.75 mm, glucose10 mm, and hepes 10 mm. the cells
were then incubated in the same buffer supplemented with neostigmine
(50 ␮m) with or without pma100 nm for 45 min. the cells were scraped
into 1 ml of methanol, and this mixture transferred to a tube containing
 xxxd2154xxx  100 ␮l 1m, vortex mixed, and centrifuged. the pellet was
collected for protein assay while ach was extracted by mixing the supernatant ﬂuid with chloroform and water (1:2:1 vol/vol). the samples were
vortex mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm. the aqueous phase
(containing ach) was collected and dried under a vacuum.

measurement of  xxxg38xxx  activity
imr32 cells (1 ⫻ 106) were homogenized in 200 ␮l of a solution of
50 mm tris ph 8.0/0.2 mm edta (buffer a), centrifuged at 12,000 ⫻ g
for 10 min, and supernatant was removed. fifty microliters of 100ug/ml
dtnb (ellmans reagent) and 50 ␮l 20 mm acetyl (␤-methyl) thiocholine iodide were added to 50 ␮l cell supernatant. a blank containing
no cells was prepared in tandem. all samples were incubated at 37⬚c
for 5 min. the reaction was followed in a plate reader at 410 nm every
5 min for 20 min. for the initial experiment, supernatants were diluted
1:2, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 to determine if the reaction was saturated.

identification of the promoter sequence of the m2
muscarinic receptor in imr32 nerve cells
preparation of promoter deletion constructs and reporter assay analysis
preparation of rna, 5⬘ rapid ampliﬁcation of cdna ends, cloning,
and sequencing from imr32 cells were performed as described previously in human airway smooth muscle cells (15). regions upstream
of each of the three identiﬁed major transcription start sites were investigated for promoter activity based on information obtained from the
analysis of the 5⬘race results. regions upstream of each of the three
identiﬁed major transcription start sites were investigated. each region
was ampliﬁed from human genomic dna using pcr primers with
restriction site consensus sequences for mlu1 and xho1built into the
terminal regions of the oligonucleotides. this was necessary to enable
subsequent directional cloning into the pgl3e ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter vector. all pcr reactions were as described in ref. 15.
preparation of promoter deletion constructs and transient transfection
of imr32 cells. transient transfections were performed using transfectam reagent. each clone pgl3e ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter plasmid was
co-transfected with prl-sv40, a plasmid that expresses renilla luciferase under the inﬂuence of an sv40 promoter. the latter plasmid was
used as a transfection efﬁciency control. transfection solutions, containing 0.75 ␮g cloned pgl3e dna, 18.75 ng prl-sv40 dna (ratio
50:1), and transfectam reagent to give a 2:1 ratio, were prepared in
serum-free cell culture media. transfection was performed via the dropwise addition of each transfection solution to a well containing differentiated imr32 cells. cells were then incubated at 37⬚c 5%co2 for
48 h. eight constructs were transfected, as well as an empty pgl3e
plasmid and a nontransfected control. each vector construct was transfected into six wells, with each individual experiment being repeated
four times. after the 48-h incubation, three wells of each transfected
construct were treated with whole human eosinophils for a further
24 h, while three wells were left untreated. this was also performed
for the empty vector and the nontransfected control.

dual luciferase reporter assay. luciferase assays were performed
using the dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the 6-well plates were removed from the incubator, and the growth medium was removed. the wells were rinsed with
pbs and aspirated. passive lysis buffer was then added to each well,
and the plates were left at room temperature for 15 min. the lysates
were assayed for ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity by the addition of lysate to
luciferase assay reagent ii, and luminescence was measured in a wallac
victor2 mutilabel counter (perkinelmer, boston, ma). renilla luciferase activity was subsequently assayed by adding stop and glo reagent
and luminometric measurement. results were normalized for variations
in transfection efﬁciency by using the ratio of ﬁreﬂy:renilla luciferase
activity as an index of promoter activity. the promoter activity of
each construct was expressed as a fold value over baseline reporter
expression activity (transfection with empty pgl3e vector).

results
eosinophils do not express mrna for the m2 muscarinic
receptor nor cholinergic genes

in these control experiments (figure 1a), rna was extracted
from 2 ⫻ 106 eosinophils, reverse transcribed, and subjected to
real-time rt-pcr using the relevant primers. results demonstrated that eosinophils did not express mrna for m2 muscarinic
receptors nor the cholinergic genes vacht, chat, and achase.
however, the ␤-actin gene product was detected in all cases,
demonstrating mrna integrity. in contrast, all of the above genes
were detected in human imr32 nerve cell rna (figures 1b
and 1c). figure 1c shows a representative ampliﬁcation plot,
demonstrating the stability of the ␤-actin message expression.
eosinophils induce both m2 mrna and protein production
in differentiated imr32 cells

real-time rt-pcr analysis revealed a 225% increase in m2
mrna relative to the untreated control after 24 h of eosinophil
co-incubation with imr32 cells (*p ⭐ 0.05) (figures 2a and
2b). cellular protein was harvested and separated into cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. western blot analysis using
a polyclonal antibody to the human m2 muscarinic receptor
indicated that m2 protein was expressed only in imr32 cell
membrane fractions (figure 2c). co-incubation of eosinophils
with imr32 cells for time periods between 1 and 24 h demonstrated that m2 muscarinic receptor protein levels doubled after
24 h of co-incubation (figures 2d and 2e).
adhesion is essential but not sufficient for eosinophil-induced
m2 protein expression in differentiated imr32 cells

in prior studies, we have shown that pretreatment of imr32 cells
with antibodies against both icam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx  completely
inhibit eosinophil adhesion to nerves (6, 8). when eosinophils
were co-incubated with imr32 nerve cells in the presence of
these antibodies, no increase in either m2 mrna or protein
synthesis was observed (figures 3a and 3b). we then investigated whether contact alone was sufﬁcient to induce changes
in  xxxg448xxx  expression similar to those observed following
treatment with whole eosinophils. eosinophil cell membranes,
which express eosinophil adhesion molecules but not eosinophil
proteins nor rna, were co-incubated with differentiated imr32
cells for 1–24 h with no observed change in m2 expression at
24 h (figure 3a). these data suggest that adhesion is necessary
but not sufﬁcient to account for the eosinophil-induced changes
in gene expression.

american journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology vol 34

we have previously shown that eosinophil adhesion to nerves
stimulates the release of eosinophil-derived factors. we then
investigated if the changes in  xxxg448xxx  expression were due
to these released factors. eosinophils synthesize, store, and release the  xxxg259xxx  ngf, which is known to inﬂuence cholinergic gene expression (16). we investigated the role of ngf
on eosinophil induced changes in  xxxg448xxx  expression by
employing a speciﬁc ngf-neutralizing antibody that signiﬁcantly

2006

reduced m2 mrna expression (figure 3c). by contrast, a normal goat igg control had no effect on eosinophil-induced upregulation of  xxxg448xxx  expression (figure 3d).
eosinophils contain four unique cationic proteins: eosinophil
major basic protein (mbp),  xxxg1964xxx  (edn),
 xxxg720xxx  (epo), and  xxxg1965xxx 
(ecp). in the absence of speciﬁc neutralizing antibodies to these
proteins, we studied the effect of mbp, edn, and epo, as well

figure 1. human eosinophils do not express cholinergic
genes. in a, eosinophil mrna was extracted from 5 ⫻ 106
human eosinophils that had been isolated from a healthy
donor, as described in materials and methods. the rna
was then reverse-transcribed and subjected to real-time
rt-pcr for m2, chat, vacht, and ␤-actin. in b, rna was
extracted from 5 ⫻ 106 imr32 nerve cells, reversetranscribed, and subjected to real-time pcr as described
in materials and methods. the pcr products for chat and
␤-actin (upper panels) and m2, vacht, and  xxxg38xxx  (lower
panels) were identifiable by their characteristic melting
temperatures. the figures are representative of three independent experiments. c and d show representative amplification plots for the real-time pcr experiments on ␤-actin
(c ) and m2 (d ).

figure 1. continued

as all three proteins in combination, on m2 gene expression in
imr32 cells. we demonstrated that, in combination (m/e/e), these
proteins increased m2 mrna expression almost 2-fold (figure
3e). the eosinophil protein concentrations chosen were similar to
those released from eosinophils (1 ⫻ 106/ml) in contact with imr32
cells (7).
eosinophils induce  xxxg448xxx  expression via transcription
start site 3 in the human m2 promoter in imr32 cells

the 5⬘ untranslated region of the m2 muscarinic gene as expressed in imr32 cells was identiﬁed using a combination of
rapid ampliﬁcation of 5⬘ cdna ends (5⬘ race) and reporter
gene assays. sequencing of successful 5⬘race clones conﬁrmed
ﬁve (a, b, c, e, and f) of the arrangements reported in human
airway smooth muscle (hasm) cells (15). a new arrangement
(g) was also identiﬁed (figure 4a). all the 5⬘utr arrangements
identiﬁed as a result of 5⬘race experiments are shown in figure
4b, together with their lengths. in total, ﬁve exons with alternative splicing patterns separated by introns ranging from 87 bp
to ⬎ 145 kb were identiﬁed, in keeping with recent studies on
both hasm and imr32 cells. to identify the major regulatory
region(s) of  xxxg448xxx  expression in imr32 cells and to also
speciﬁcally identify the regions where eosinophils were exerting
their effects, a series of promoter deletion constructs that spanned
the three transcription start sites (tss) were designed (figure
4b). these were used in a series of transient transfection experiments on imr32 cells that were exposed to eosinophils for 24 h;
luciferase-based reporter assays were subsequently used to detect
activity. the results obtained from imr32 transfectants treated
with 2 ⫻ 105 eosinophils for a 24-h period (figure 4c) demonstrated construct c1 to have higher activity (6.34 ⫾ 0.68 [⫹eos]–
versus 3.12 ⫾ 3.30 [control]–fold over empty vector [n ⫽ 4, p ⬍
0.05]) than c2 (3.62 ⫾ 1.65 [⫹eos]– versus 1.45 ⫾1.41 [control]–
fold over empty vector [n ⫽ 4, p ⫽ 0.05]). both of these regions
contain sequence upstream of tss3, suggesting that the major
regulatory region for the muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  expression in
response to eosinophils in imr32 cells lies immediately

eosinophils induce chat and vacht mrna and protein
production in differentiated imr32 cells

eosinophils induced a 5-fold increase in chat gene expression
relative to ␤-actin control after 24 h of co-incubation with imr32
cells (n ⫽ 5, *p ⭐ 0.05). western blotting of harvested imr32
cellular protein fractions (figure 5a) demonstrated that chat
protein was expressed only in the cytoplasmic fraction of imr32
cells and not in either the membrane or nuclear fractions (figure
5b). eosinophil co-incubation with imr32 cells induced a
2-fold increase in chat protein expression by 24 h (figure 5c).
real-time rt-pcr demonstrated that eosinophils induced a
132 ⫾ 12% increase in vacht gene expression relative to
␤-actin control after 1 h of eosinophil co-incubation with imr32
cells (*p ⫽ 0.05). western blotting of protein fractions from
imr32 cells demonstrated that vacht was only expressed in
the membrane fraction of imr32 and not in the cytoplasmic
fraction (figure 5d). eosinophils co-incubated with imr32 cells
induced a 2-fold increase in vacht protein expression after
24 h of co-culture (figures 5e and 5f).
eosinophil adhesion reduces acetylcholine content and
increases choline content in imr32 cells

eosinophil co-incubation with differentiated imr32 cells over
24–48 h signiﬁcantly decreased ach content, with a concomitant
signiﬁcant increase in choline levels (figures 6a and 6b).

in the activity of  xxxg38xxx  in imr32 cells after 24 h of eosinophil
co-incubation (figure 7b).
eosinophils do not induce mnsod mrna production in
differentiated imr32 cells

in prior studies it has been shown that contact between eosinophils and nerves led to the generation of oxygen free radicals
in imr32 nerve cells (8, 12). furthermore, it has also been
demonstrated that these free radicals were important intermediate signals involved in nf-␬b activation in the nerve cells controlling nerve growth (9–11). thus, we investigated whether the
antioxidant gene, mnsod, was also effected by eosinophil coculture with nerves. rt-pcr demonstrated that in imr32 cells
eosinophils did not induce an increase in mnsod mrna at
any of the time points studied (figure 8).

figure 2. eosinophils induce m2 mrna and protein production in differentiated imr32 cells. differentiated imr32 cells were co-incubated with
2 ⫻ 105 human eosinophils for time periods of 1–24 h. the rna was
extracted, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to (a ) quantitative real-time
rt-pcr on lightcycler, where m2 levels are normalized to ␤-actin (values
are mean ⫾ sd, n ⫽ 3, *p ⬍ 0.05, relative to untreated control); or (b )
semiquantitative pcr was performed and m2 and ␤-actin pcr products
were resolved on an agarose gel. in c, western blot was performed on
membrane and cytoplasmic protein fractions extracted from imr32 cells
that were exposed to eosinophils for the indicated time points, as described in materials and methods. this experiment demonstrated that
m2 protein was detected only in membrane fractions. in d, western blot
analysis of imr32 cell membrane protein fractions of imr32 cells that
were co-incubated with eosinophils for the indicated times is shown.
maximal m2 protein expression was observed at 24 h. ␤-actin was detected after stripping and re-probing of the blot shown in d (upper panel).
in e, the eosinophil-induced change in m2 protein from d is displayed
graphically (values are mean ⫾ sd, n ⫽ 3, *p ⬍ 0.05).

the effects of eosinophil co-culture on cholinergic gene and
protein expression in the cholinergic nerve cell line imr32 were
addressed in this study. of particular interest was the muscarinic
 xxxg448xxx , the cholinergic enzymes chat (instrumental in
acetylcholine synthesis) and vacht (responsible for ach packaging), and the ach hydrolysing enzyme  xxxg38xxx . the results
obtained indicate that eosinophils alter the cholinergic phenotype of imr32 cells. we observed that eosinophils increase m2,
chat, and vacht mrna and protein production after 24 h
of co-culture. furthermore, this led to increased ach turnover
and a signiﬁcant decrease in  xxxg38xxx  enzymatic activity. there
was no alteration in gene expression of the antioxidant enzyme
mnsod at any of the time points studied, indicating that the
observed changes in cholinergic genes were speciﬁc and not part
of a generalized change in gene expression. thus, eosinophils
induce a muscarinic receptor that controls the release of ach
from nerves, induce the enzymes involved in the synthesis and
storage of ach, and cause a loss of function of the enzyme,
which is responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. together
these data suggest that eosinophils promote and enhance the
release of ach from cholinergic nerve cell terminals.
it is known that the signaling molecules  xxxg1743xxx  kinase, pka, and
the map kinases are involved in regulating the expression of
chat, vacht, and the m2 muscarinic receptor via a series
of signaling pathways (17–19). in vitro, we have shown that
eosinophils adhere to nerve cells via speciﬁc adhesion molecules
and subsequently release factors that induce signaling pathways
in nerve cells (9). since eosinophils are known to promote airway
remodeling in asthma, and since the expression of cholinergic
genes is controlled by eosinophil-activated signaling pathways,
we investigated whether eosinophils were responsible for the
activation of these genes in cholinergic nerve cells.
in this study,  xxxg448xxx  protein levels increased by at least
2.5-fold after 24 h of eosinophil co-culture. experiments were
undertaken to demonstrate the mechanisms underlying these
changes. first, it was shown that eosinophils need to be adherent
to nerves via the adhesion molecules icam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx  to
induce  xxxg448xxx  expression, as no alteration in gene expression was observed in the presence of adhesion inhibitors. however, adhesion alone was insufﬁcient to induce m2 expression,
as a preparation of isolated eosinophil membranes did not induce
these changes. therefore, eosinophil adhesion led to the release
of eosinophil factors that were responsible for changes in cholinergic phenotype, as we have previously described (8, 12). functional studies revealed that this increased expression of m2 was
due to released ngf and eosinophil cationic proteins, as m2

figure 3. eosinophil-induced m2 gene and protein expression in differentiated imr32 cells is dependent on eosinophil adhesion and released factors such as ngf and eosinophil proteins. in a,
differentiated imr32 cells were either pretreated
with antibodies against  xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1 and
then co-incubated with 2 ⫻ 105 isolated eosinophils for 24 h, or were co-incubated with purified
membranes isolated from 2 ⫻ 105 human eosinophils for 24 h. rna was extracted, reversetranscribed, and subjected to quantitative realtime rt-pcr (n ⫽ 3, *p ⬍ 0.05, relative to
untreated control). neither eosinophil membranes nor whole eosinophils in the presence of
blocking antibodies induced m2 mrna expression
in differentiated imr32 cells. m2 levels were normalized against the housekeeping gene ␤-actin.
b shows western blot analysis depicting m2 protein
levels in imr32 cell membrane fractions that were
pretreated with the blocking antibodies described
above and then co-incubated with 2 ⫻ 105 human
eosinophils for up to 48 h. figure is representative of three independent experiments. (c and d )
differentiated imr32 cells were either left untreated
or were treated with (c ) an ngf-neutralizing antibody (0.08 ng/ml) or (d ) an equivalent amount of
normal goat igg, and subsequently co-incubated
with 2 ⫻ 105 human eosinophils for 24 h. cellular
rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to quantitative real-time rt-pcr (n ⫽ 4,
*p ⫽ 0.05, when compared with untreated control). in e, the effect of eosinophil proteins on m2
receptor expression in imr32 cells is shown. the
eosinophil granule proteins mbp, epo, and edn
were incubated with imr32 cells both separately
and in combination (m/e/e) for 24 h. cellular rna
was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and subjected
to quantitative real-time rt-pcr (n ⫽ 3, *p ⬍ 0.05,
when compared with untreated control).

gene expression was induced at 24 h by mbp (170%) and epo
(300%), suggesting these proteins play a part in the change
induced by whole eosinophils (245%). interestingly, treatment
with edn signiﬁcantly decreased m2 expression (50%). when
cells were treated with a combination of all three proteins, m2
expression was seen to increase signiﬁcantly (190%), but not
achieving levels as high as that of whole eosinophils.

from this study, it appears that m2 expression is negatively
regulated by factors as yet unidentiﬁed. it is possible that edn
could play an important role in this regulation. it is known to
possess potent rnase activity which may explain in part the
absence of the m2 gene at the later time points. that is, it may
speciﬁcally target a factor necessary for m2 transcription or it
may directly affect m2 mrna.

nontransfected control).

to identify the promoter region(s) of imr32 cells that exerts
the most signiﬁcant regulatory control over m2 transcription
in response to eosinophil co-culture, we initially identiﬁed the
transcription starts sites in imr32 cells and subsequently performed reporter gene studies. analysis of the sequence data
arising from 5⬘race experiments identiﬁed the presence of six
different mrna transcripts. the region also contains ﬁve exons
of which exon 2 and exon 5 are alternatively spliced. the experiment conﬁrmed the earlier published results (15, 20), and also
identiﬁed one new transcript arrangement (g) (figure 4d). we
identiﬁed three regions of transcription initiation in the human
muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  gene 5⬘utr, with each region containing
a cluster of speciﬁc transcription start sites (tsss) in close proximity to each other. the most 5⬘ tss lies more than 146 kb
upstream from the atg start codon of the gene.
the m2 coding sequence is preceded by a 46-bp exon that is
expressed in all mrna transcripts we obtained. upstream of this,

we have identiﬁed four additional exons, of which exons 5 and 2
are alternatively spliced. our data suggest that the tss1 region
appears to be the most commonly used transcription start site (23
out of 46 clones), whereas tss2 is the rarest (3 out of 46 clones).
reporter gene expression analysis performed on imr32 cells,
transiently transfected with  xxxg2041xxx  enhancer constructs, provided
data that strongly suggest that the major regulatory region lies
immediately upstream of tss3. in addition, it would appear that
repressor elements could operate upstream of tss1, which is
supported by the fact that construct 4 induces decreased expression of m2 compared with construct 3. also, all constructs containing regions upstream of tss2 displayed low activity levels.
the human muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  promoter, similar to all
muscarinic receptor promoters identiﬁed, is tata-less. sp1,
 xxxg1222xxx , ap2, and gata transcription factors have previously
been cited as relevant for tata-less promoters (21–26). in view
of this it is interesting to note that the highest incidence of

figure 5. eosinophils induce chat and vacht production in
differentiated imr32 cells. differentiated imr32 cells were coincubated with 2 ⫻ 105 human eosinophils for the indicated
time points. in a, rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and
subjected to quantitative real-time rt-pcr and chat levels
normalized against ␤-actin (n ⫽ 3, **p ⬍ 0.005, when compared with untreated control). in b, western blot analysis of
imr32 cell cytoplasmic, membrane, and nuclear fractions
demonstrated that chat protein was expressed solely in cytoplasmic fractions. in c, co-incubation of imr32 cells with eosinophils led to an increase in chat protein expression in cytoplasmic fractions, which was maximal at 24 h. in d, a graphical
representation of western blot analyses demonstrated that
chat protein expression was significantly increased relative
to control after 24 h of co-culture (figures are representative
of three independent experiments). in e, western blot analysis
membrane and cytoplasmic fractions from imr32 cells demonstrated that vacht protein was present only in membrane
fractions and that eosinophil-induced increases in vacht protein expression were maximal at 24 h. in f, co-incubation of
imr32 cells with eosinophils for 24 h led to a significant increase in vacht protein expression relative to ␤-actin. figures
are representative of three independent experiments.

sp1, gata, and ap sites lies within the region of maximum
transcriptional regulatory activity, immediately upstream of
tss3. we have previously shown that eosinophil mbp can induce ap transcription factor activation in imr32 cells (9), but
further studies will be required to establish which transcription
factors are involved in eosinophil-induced activation of the m2
receptor.
ach is synthesized from choline and acetyl coa under the
enzymatic action of chat and is transported into the synaptic
vesicle by the action of vacht, where it is stored until required.

twenty-four hours of eosinophil co-culture with imr32 nerve
cells led to an increase in chat and vacht protein levels. at
the same time, choline levels are seen to increase by at least
3-fold. these facts suggest that the increased levels of intracellular choline are due to an increase in choline uptake in order for
de novo ach synthesis to occur. there is also a corresponding
increase in chat enzyme levels, leading to increased amounts
of ach. however, vacht protein levels are also increased,
suggesting increased packaging of the newly synthesized ach
into vesicles. these facts suggest a rapid turnover of ach such

that intracellular ach levels fall quickly and extracellular levels
are high. indeed, overexpression of vacht in immature xenopus neurons increased the amount of neurotransmitters released
by synaptic vesicles (27). similar results were obtained for the
related molecule vmat2 (a  xxxg2099xxx ), which
demonstrated that increasing its expression in mature synaptic
vesicles actually increased transmitter release (28). this is supported by our prior experiments, which demonstrated an increase in the spontaneous release of ach from nerves after
exposure to eosinophils (6, 7). speciﬁcally, we demonstrated
that when eosinophils are added to imr32 cells, they enhance
acetylcholine release by 36% (7). we have also previously shown
that eosinophils degranulate in response to adhesion to imr32
cells (6, 8). mbp is a major eosinophil degranulation product
and is a selective allosteric antagonist at the  xxxg448xxx  (29–31),
thus release of mbp from eosinophils renders the  xxxg448xxx

dysfunctional, resulting in the increased ach release we refer
to above. the effect of this protein is an important cause of m2
receptor dysfunction and enhanced vagally mediated bronchoconstriction in asthma. it may be that the observed increase in
m2 expression in response to eosinophils and to mbp and epo
is an attempt to overcome this antagonistic effect.
levels of ach esterase were seen to increase modestly between 1 and 12 h, but this was not maintained beyond 12 h. as
an alternative to western blotting for  xxxg38xxx  protein, enzyme
activity was measured, as results obtained would be of greater
functional signiﬁcance. after 24 h of eosinophil co-culture with
nerve cells, there was a fall in  xxxg38xxx  activity. this may be of
some signiﬁcance, as loss of  xxxg38xxx  activity would be expected
to lead to increased neurotransmission via ach and augment
the effect of the other changes seen in this system (i.e., increased
cholinergic activity). there have been prior studies in a number
of animal models of loss of function of  xxxg38xxx  (27,
32–48). the observation of decreased  xxxg38xxx  activity in the context of a modest increase in  xxxg38xxx 
protein expression may seem contradictory.  xxxg38xxx  exists in multiple molecular forms, which are differentially
inactivated in different cell growth conditions (49). therefore,
depending on what molecular form is predominantly present, it
could be inactivated in our cell system. however, another possible explanation is that in this manuscript we measured the expression of cell-associated  xxxg38xxx , not soluble cellfree  xxxg38xxx . in other cells, most  xxxg38xxx  enzymatic activity (ⵑ 80%) is detected in the cell growth
medium as soluble  xxxg38xxx , both in humans and in
other species (50, 51). therefore, in this context it is not unexpected that increased  xxxg38xxx  cell-associated protein expression does not correspond to increased activity.
several control experiments were performed to verify the
speciﬁcity of these results. first, we investigated whether the
eosinophils caused nerve cell death. previous studies and our
own preliminary studies indicated that co-culture of eosinophils
with imr32 cells did not lead to signiﬁcant apoptosis of either
the nerves or the eosinophils when they were maintained in coculture for as long as 96 h (12). indeed, we have shown that
eosinophils and their degranulation proteins protect imr32 cells
from apoptosis (52, 53). second, to avoid potential contamination by gene products contained within eosinophils, mrna extracted from eosinophils was subjected to rt-pcr. in all cases
there was no detection of cholinergic genes or the m2 muscarinic
receptor. therefore, the increase in  xxxg448xxx , chat,  xxxg38xxx ,
and vacht mrna expression observed were due to changes
within imr32 cells alone. similar experiments were also performed on eosinophil total protein to verify the absence of the
corresponding proteins. western blotting analysis with speciﬁc
antibodies also failed to detect any of the proteins of interest in
eosinophil total protein. the choice of eosinophil concentration

durcan, costello, mclean, et al.: eosinophil-mediated nerve remodeling

used for these co-culture experiments was based on prior studies
performed in the laboratory. dose–response studies indicated
that 2 ⫻ 10 5/ml of eosinophils was optimal for transcription
factor activation in 5 ⫻ 10 5 imr32 cells; therefore this number
was used for gene expression studies. also, to conﬁrm that the
changes in enzymes were of physiologic signiﬁcance, we also
measured the levels of ach and enzymatic activity of the  xxxg38xxx  activity. finally, to assess the speciﬁcity of the
changes induced by eosinophils, we measured changes in the
antioxidant gene mnsod. this was measured because adherence of eosinophils to imr32 cells in culture induces free radical
production in the imr32 cells, as assessed by oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123. however, no change in mnsod mrna
levels was observed following eosinophil co-culture.
since m2 levels are increased, it would be expected that there
would be a decrease in vagally mediated bronchoconstriction,
as m2 acts as an autoreceptor limiting the excessive release of
ach. however this does not seem to be the case in pathologic
states such as asthma. prior functional studies have shown that
m2 receptors are inhibited by eosinophil mbp (29–31). thus,
combining this data with the current observations, we suggest
that the increased ach released from eosinophil-stimulated
nerves would be unable to bind m2 receptors but still able to
bind m3 receptors, which are not inhibited by mbp, resulting
in increased vagally mediated hyperreactivity (30).
the results of this study show that eosinophils have a profound effect on cholinergic gene expression in imr32 cells,
which tend to promote a cholinergic phenotype. these effects
are exerted via eosinophil adhesion and factors released from
eosinophil granules after adhesion, including the cationic proteins mbp and epo and also ngf. release of ngf and other
neurotrophins may contribute signiﬁcantly to nerve remodeling
in asthma and other allergic diseases. our results show that
ngf released from eosinophils contributes signiﬁcantly to the
observed upregulation of  xxxg448xxx  expression. neurotrophins
including ngf are survival factors for eosinophils (1); therefore,
release of ngf would tend to perpetuate the effects of eosinophils on nerve cells, as well as exerting direct effects on the nerve
cells. ngf has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of
allergic illness (reviewed refs. 54 and 55). its circulating levels
are increased in allergy and it induces hyperresponsiveness of
isolated human bronchus (56). effects on bronchial hyperresponsiveness maybe due to ngf-induced increases in innervation.
however, our results imply that in allergy, eosinophil-derived
ngf may also directly affect nerve cholinergic phenotype, contributing in this way to ach release, nerve hyperreactivity, and
remodeling and thus to bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
to summarize, this work has demonstrated that increased
expression of the m2 muscarinic receptor in imr32 cells results
ﬁrst from eosinophil adhesion to nerve cells and second from
the products subsequently released by eosinophils; including the
cationic proteins and ngf. the study characterized the 5⬘ utr
of the human muscarinic  xxxg448xxx  gene and has deﬁned
sites of transcriptional regulation by eosinophils. in addition,
the studies have shown an eosinophil-induced increase in the
turnover and release of ach and a reduction in acetlycholinesterase activity. together these data suggest that eosinophils promote cholinergic nerve cell remodeling, a feature of many clinical
manifestations (among them asthma).
