abstract. trimethoprim (tmp), an inhibitor of  xxxg631xxx , decreases the level of tetrahydrofolate supplying one-carbon units for biosynthesis of nucleotides, proteins, and panthotenate. we have
demonstrated for the first time that one of the effects of the tmp action in e. coli cells is protein
aggregation and induction of heat shock proteins (hsps). tmp caused induction of dnak, dnaj,  xxxg1106xxx ,
clpb, and ibpa/b hsps. among these hsps, ibpa/b were most efficiently induced by tmp and
coaggregated with the insoluble proteins. upon folate stress, deletion of the ⌬ibpa/b operon resulted in
increased protein aggregation but did not influence cell viability.

the antimicrobial drug, tmp, interrupts folate metabolism by inhibition of the activity of dihydrofolase reductase (dhfr), which reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (thf). thf supplies one-carbon units for the
synthesis of methionine, glycine, thymidylate, purines,
panthotenate, and formyl-methionyl-trnafmet [13].
tmp treatment of e. coli cells results in the induction of
a subset of 21 proteins (folate stress proteins) including
uspa (universal stress protein a), ferric uptake regulatory repressor, and  xxxg641xxx  [5]. some
of the proteins synthesized in the tmp-treated cells and
resolved by 2d-page exhibit altered pi. it was proposed
that uspa overexpression upon folate stress might lead
to a posttranslational modification of newly synthesized
proteins [5, 16]. alternatively, changes in the isoelectric
mobility of proteins might result from a misincorporation
of amino acids. it was reported that disturbance of folate
metabolism decreased translational accuracy in e. coli,
probably by mischarging trnas or trna mispairing at
the ribosome [2, 5]. posttranslational modifications and
reduced fidelity of translation, as a consequence of thf
depletion, could in turn cause protein misfolding and
aggregation. in this work, we addressed the question
whether protein misfolding and aggregation are indeed
one of the effects of folate stress. besides monitoring
formation of protein aggregates, we studied induction of
hsps in cells treated with tmp, since accumulation of

misfolded proteins is a signal for increased synthesis of
hsps [4]. hsps function as molecular chaperones that
assist protein folding and prevent proteins from irreversible denaturation, or heat shock proteases removing the
damaged polypeptides. therefore, we investigated
whether tmp-induced levels of selected hsps—members of two main chaperone systems in e. coli, dnakdnaj-grpe and  xxxg1106xxx -groes—as well as the levels of
clpb, ibpa, and ibpb proteins cooperating with the
dnak system. we focused our attention on the ibpa/b,
which belong to the ubiquitous family of small heat
shock proteins (shsps). ibpa/b are components of inclusion bodies formed in e. coli cells overproducing
heterologous proteins [1] as well as of endogenous protein aggregates formed in heat-stressed bacteria [12]. it
has been demonstrated that in vitro the shsps protect
substrates from irreversible aggregation and inactivation
by the heat and oxidative stress [8, 17, 19]. shsps hold
denatured substrates in a folding-competent state and
deliver them to the dnak system for atp-dependent
refolding. in vivo ibpa/b suppress protein aggregation
during extreme heat stress (50°c) [10]. regulation of the
ibpa/b operon seems to be more complex in comparison
with the other hsps’ genes. overproduction of ␴32, the
rna polymerase subunit controlling heat shock promoters, from a plasmid at 28°c induced the majority of the
hsps but not ibpa/b. the ibpa/b synthesis was suppressed in the metk cells with a reduced  xxxg1378xxx  activity [14]. considering these data,

matthews and neidhardt [13, 14] suggested that some
metabolic signal, generated by one-carbon metabolism
and not yet identified, is required for the ibpa/b induction. since tmp diminishes the pool of available onecarbon units, it is reasonable to suppose that the ibpa/b
level could be influenced by folate stress.
materials and methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions. mc4100 [arad139 ⌬(lacipozya argf)u169 fla rela rpsl] and mc4100 ⌬ibpa/b [10] were
grown at 37°c in mops minimal medium [15] supplemented with
0.4% glucose and 1 ␮g ml⫺1 thiamine. at exponential phase, the
bacteria were shifted to 44°c, or tmp was added to a final concentration of 0.3–3 ␮g ml⫺1.
isolation of insoluble proteins from e. coli cells. cells were harvested, converted into spheroplasts, lysed by sonication, and fractionated by ultracentrifugation according to kucharczyk et al. [9]. briefly,
insoluble material containing aggregated proteins and cell membranes
was separated from soluble, cytoplasmic, and periplasmic proteins in a
two-step sg0 sucrose density gradient. subsequently the insoluble
fraction was loaded on a six-step sg1 gradient to separate aggregates
from the e. coli membranes. subfractions were collected from the
bottom of the tube and analyzed for protein concentration according to
bradford [3].
analytical methods. proteins were resolved by 0.1% sds–15% page
according to laemmli [11]. two-dimensional page and silver staining
were performed according to laskowska et al. [12], using 1.6% ph
6 – 8 and 0.4% ph 3.5–10 carrier ampholite mixture (pharmacia).
polyclonal rabbit antisera against clpb, dnak,  xxxg1106xxx , dnaj, and
ibpa/b, anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (sigma, usa) and substrates:
4-chloro-1-naphthol and h2o2 (serva, germany) were used for the
hsps immunodetection.

results and discussion
trimethoprim-induced heat shock proteins in e. coli
cells. western blotting analysis of e. coli mc4100 cells
submitted to folate stress revealed that the level of all
tested hsps was increased during incubation in the presence of tmp (1.5–3 ␮g) (fig. 1a). since the clpb gene
codes for two polypeptides with different lengths, two
clp bands were visible. in the tmp-treated cells, the
amounts of clpb, dnak,  xxxg1106xxx , and dnaj increased 3-,
2.4-, 1.4-, and 2-fold, respectively, but were apparently
lower than those in the heat-stressed (44°c, 1 h) bacteria
(fig. 1a). ibpa/b were not detected in the control cells
(37°c). in e. coli cells incubated in the presence of tmp,
the amount of ibpa/b reached a level similar to that in
the bacteria stressed at 44°c. ibpa and ibpb were visible
as a single band on a membrane, since they have similar
molecular weights. 2d-page analysis showed that both
shsps were induced by tmp as efficiently as by incubation at 44°c (fig. 1b). according to the present model of
regulation of heat shock response, in non-stressed cells
the dnak– chaperone system bound and inhibited ␴32 by

supplemented with 0.4% glucose and thiamine (1 ␮g ml⫺1). at the
exponential phase, tmp (1.5–3 ␮g mg⫺1) was added or the cultures
were transferred to 44°c. samples corresponding to the same amount
of bacteria were taken at 37°c and after 1 h of incubation in the
presence of tmp or at 44°c, and then subjected to 0.1% sds–15%
page and immunodetection with anti-hsps sera. the level of hsps
(see results and discussion) was estimated by densitometry by using
the sigma gel program (a). after 1 h of tmp (3 ␮g ml⫺1) and heat
shock treatment, e. coli proteins were resolved by 2d-page and
immunodetected with anti-ibpa/b serum (b).

mediating its degradation by proteases [18]. upon stress
conditions, misfolded proteins titrated dnak and dnaj;
therefore, the activity of ␴32 increased and hsps were
induced. thus, the elevated amount of hsps in the folatestressed e. coli suggested that abnormal proteins appeared in the cells. we further investigated whether
misfolded proteins were present in the tmp-treated cells
by monitoring formation of protein aggregates.

proteins denatured upon heat shock form aggregates,
which can be isolated from the e. coli cells by sucrosegradient ultracentrifugation [9]. after 1 h of incubation at
44°c in mops minimal medium, the aggregated proteins
constituted 1% of total cellular proteins (fig. 2) in the e.
coli wt strain. as we expected, insoluble proteins were
also presented in the tmp-treated wt bacteria (0.7%). at
a low concentration of tmp (0.3 ␮g ml⫺1), when only

bars, respectively) were grown at 37°c in mops minimal medium
supplemented with 0.4% glucose and thiamine (1 ␮g ml⫺1). at the
mid-exponential phase, tmp was added to a final concentration of 1.5
and 3 ␮g ml⫺1, or the temperature was shifted to 44°c. the protein
aggregates were isolated (see materials and methods) at 37°c and after
1 h of incubation in the presence of tmp or at 44°c. the amount of
aggregated proteins was calculated in relation to the total protein
(100%). error bars represent the standard deviation of three values.

a weak induction of clpb could be detected, the level of
protein aggregation was similar to that of the control
strain grown at 37°c (not shown). it should be noted that
in tmp-treated cells probably not all insoluble proteins
are post-translationally modified or contain misincorporated amino acids. some properly synthesized proteins
may also aggregate as a result of transient limitation of
the hsps level necessary for protection of proteins from
aggregation. for the same reason, aggregates formed at a
high temperature contained not only thermolabile but
also thermostable proteins [7]. since ibpa/b were the
most efficiently induced hsps by folate stress, we investigated effect of the ⌬ibpa/b mutation on protein aggregation. at 44°c, a decreased level of insoluble proteins
was observed in the ⌬ibpa/b mutant (fig. 2). these data
are consistent with the previously published results suggesting that under relatively mild heat shock conditions
(45°c, 15 min, lb medium), denatured proteins were
refolded more efficiently by the dnak-dnaj-grpe system in the absence of ibpa/b [10]. contrary to that, with
severe stress (50°c, 4 h), a twofold increase in protein
aggregation was observed in the ⌬ibpa/b mutant [11].
we found that tmp induced a higher level of insoluble
proteins in the ⌬ibpa/b mutant (1% at 3 ␮g ml⫺1 tmp)
than in the wt cells (0.7%). this indicated that ibpa/b
inhibited protein aggregation caused by disturbance of
folate metabolism. however, we did not observe any

fig. 3. sds–page analysis of the aggregated proteins. protein aggregates were isolated from e. coli mc4100 and mc4100 ⌬ibpa/b after
1 h exposure to tmp (3 ␮g ml⫺1) or to 44°c. samples of the
aggregated proteins (50 ␮g each) were subjected to 0.1% sds–15%

difference in cell viability between these two strains
subjected to folate stress (data not shown). similar results were obtained with a higher tmp concentration (5
␮g ml⫺1) or after a prolonged exposure to tmp (3 h).
therefore, increased protein aggregation in the
⌬ibpa/b cells did not influence the bacteriostatic effect
of tmp. sds–page revealed that the aggregates
formed at 44°c and during folate stress differed in the
protein content (fig. 3a). the most intensive proteins
bands were common for both types of aggregates; however, it was clearly visible that more protein species were
present in the heat shock than in the tmp-induced aggregates. coomassie blue-stained gel (not shown)
showed that the majority of the aggregated proteins had
molecular weights exceeding 30 kda. it is apparent that
longer, multidomain polypeptides may be particularly
prone to misfolding as the result of thf depletion or
thermal denaturation. ibpa/b were detected in both
kinds of aggregates (fig. 3b); however, it seems that
their absence in the cell did not influence the protein
pattern of the aggregates. thus, ibpa/b did not protect
any particular protein from aggregation but inhibited
aggregation in general.

e. laskowska et al.: tmp and protein in e. coli cells

tmp alone or in combination with sulfonamides is
one of the most frequently used antimicrobial agents.
however, during the last decades, an increase in the rate
of bacterial resistance to tmp has been observed. moreover, side effects (allergic reactions and nonallergic systemic reactions) have also been reported [6]. we have
demonstrated that tmp caused protein aggregation and
induction of main hsps, which indicates that tmp presence leads to protein misfolding. these results expand
characterization of the tmp action in e. coli cells and
could be relevant in the context of the mechanisms of
resistance and side effects caused by tmp.
