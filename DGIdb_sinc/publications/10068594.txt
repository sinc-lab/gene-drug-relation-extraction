mutations in human cyp2c19 and parasite  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) genes, related
to poor metabolism of  xxxd1672xxx  and resistance to cycloguanil, respectively, have both been
assumed to be associated with poor antimalarial effect by  xxxd1672xxx . to study this, 95 subjects
with uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum or plasmodium vivax infections in vanuatu received  xxxd1672xxx  treatment for 3 days (adult relative dose of 300–500 mg/day) and were followed up for 28 days. a similarly high antimalarial efficacy against both infections was observed in 62 patients with cyp2c19-related poor metabolizer genotype and in 33 with
extensive metabolizer genotype, even though blood cycloguanil was significantly more often
detected in those with extensive metabolizer genotype than in those with poor metabolizer
genotype. all 28 p. falciparum isolates had two dhfr mutations (residues 59 and 108), suggesting
moderate resistance to cycloguanil. the results suggest that the parent compound  xxxd1672xxx 
has significant intrinsic efficacy against falciparum and vivax malaria independent of the
metabolite cycloguanil.

malaria is a pandemic disease drawing increasing attention
globally. the increasing resistance of plasmodium falciparum to
common antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, has resulted in a renewed interest in
alternative drug regimens.
 xxxd1672xxx , a biguanide, was synthesized and found to have
antimalarial activity in 1945 [1].  xxxd1672xxx  is metabolized in

the liver to the active metabolite, cycloguanil [2], which has
shown much higher in vitro activity against p. falciparum blood
stages than has the prodrug or the second metabolite, 4-chlorophenylbiguanide [3, 4]. cycloguanil and pyrimethamine, another antifolate compound, act by selectively inhibiting  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) in the plasmodium parasites [5].
p. falciparum resistance to the compounds has been associated
with specific point mutations in the dhfr gene [6, 7]. recent
findings of a high synergistic activity between  xxxd1672xxx  and
an electron transport inhibitor  xxxd243xxx  for malaria treatment [8] and prophylaxis [9], despite widespread resistance to
dhfr inhibitors, have suggested a possible non–dhfr-related intrinsic antimalarial activity of the prodrug.
 xxxd1672xxx  and  xxxd2568xxx  metabolism is mediated via the
cytochrome p-450 isoenzyme cyp2c19 [10]. a poor ability to
metabolize s- xxxd2568xxx  (poor metabolizer [pm] phenotype)
has been observed in only 3%–5% of caucasians [11], ethiopians [12], and zimbabweans [13] but in 13%–23% of oriental
populations [11]. the impaired metabolism results from defects
in the cyp2c19 gene. two genetic defects, m1 and m2, have
been identified [14]. at least one wild type (wt) allele is considered necessary to be an extensive metabolizer (em). we have
recently found a uniquely high frequency (71%) of cyp2c19related pm genotype status in two islands in which malaria is
endemic (tanna and malakula) of vanuatu [15]. whether the

poor metabolism of  xxxd1672xxx , resulting in low plasma concentrations of cycloguanil, would lead to the poor therapeutic
efficacy against malaria has not properly been studied.
we have, therefore, studied the antimalarial efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  treatment in patients with uncomplicated malaria in vanuatu in relation to human cyp2c19 genotypes, capillary
blood concentrations of  xxxd1672xxx -cycloguanil, and parasite
dhfr genotypes.

methods
study area and patient selection. vanuatu consists of 80 islands
in melanesia, in many of which malaria is endemic [16]. the firstline drug for malaria treatment in children aged !5 years old was
changed in 1991 from chloroquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
because of increasing resistance of p. falciparum to chloroquine.
in february–march 1996, malariometric surveys were conducted
in leviamp village and surrounding primary schools on the central
island of malakula. subjects found to have malaria were selected
to be included in the study. exclusion criteria were mixed infections,
moderate or severe symptoms, intake of antimalarial(s) within the
previous 3 weeks, significant concomitant diseases, !1 year of age,
pregnancy, or breast-feeding.
microscopic examinations. parasitologic diagnosis of malaria
was made microscopically on thick and thin blood smears, which
were stained with 10% giemsa solution and examined for 10 min.
parasite density was estimated by counting asexual parasites
against 100–400 leukocytes in a thick film, assuming a leukocyte
count of 8000/ml of blood.
treatment regimens and in vivo follow up. patients received
 xxxd1672xxx  for 3 days in daily doses corresponding to adult doses
of 500 mg (initially) or 300 mg. doses for children were calculated
as a fraction of the adult dose based on the age as follows: onethird (1–4 years), one-half (5–8 years), two-thirds (9–15 years), and
full (115 years). the  xxxd1672xxx  tablets ( xxxd1672xxx , 100 mg tablet;
zeneca pharmaceuticals, wilmington, de) were administered between meals under close supervision.
symptoms and clinical signs were recorded daily from day 0 (day
of treatment) to day 3 in addition to parasitologic examinations.
subjects were again similarly examined on days 7, 14, 21, and 28.
the parasitologic responses were graded according to the modified
world health organization criteria (s, no parasites on day 7 and
no recurrence days 14–28; r1, no parasites on day 7 and with
recurrence day 14–28; r2, day 2 parasite density <25% of that on
day 0 but recurrence by day 7; r3, day 2 parasite density 125%
of that on day 0). therapeutic efficacy was assessed mainly by the
s 1 r1 rate.
whenever treatment was interrupted because of side effects, or
the response was defined as r3, r2, or r1, the follow-up was ended
and an alternative treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was
provided.
filter paper blood sampling. fingerprick blood samples were
drawn into one or two capillary tubes (100 ml, heparinized; drummond scientific, broomall, pa) and transferred on to chromatography filter paper (et31chr; whatman, maidstone, uk) both
before treatment (day 0) and 3 and 24 h after the first and third

975

doses, respectively. the dried filter paper samples were stored in
small plastic bags at 2207c before analysis by polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) and high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc).
human and parasite genotyping. dna was first extracted from
one-fourth of a dried blood spot (25 ml) on the day 0 filter paper
as described by uchida et al. [17].
the pcrs for the human cyp2c19 gene were then conducted
as described by de morais et al. [14], by amplification of exon 5
followed by smai digestion (cyp2c19m1) and amplification of
exon 4 followed by bamhi digestion (cyp2c19m2).
the nested pcrs for the p. falciparum dhfr gene were done as
described by reeder et al. [18]. the purified fragment from the dhfr
amplification was directly sequenced by a dideoxy chain-termination method (dna sequencing kit; perkin elmer, norwalk,
ct). data were collected on an automated sequencer (abi 377;
perkin elmer), and complementary sequences from both strands
were examined.
hplc assay.  xxxd1672xxx , cycloguanil, and 4-chlorophenylbiguanide were determined in the 100-ml capillary blood paper samples by an adapted method by use of a solid-phase extraction technique and hplc. the coefficients of variation for  xxxd1672xxx  and
cycloguanil were !15% at all observed concentration ranges. the
limits of determination were 100 nmol/l for  xxxd1672xxx  and 50 nmol/
l for cycloguanil and 4-chlorophenylbiguanide.
statistical analyses. the numeric data are given as mean 5
se. standard statistical methods, including student’s t test, x2 test,
and fisher’s exact test, were used where appropriate. all reported
confidence intervals are 95% and p values are two-sided.

results
parasitologic findings.
of 1521 persons surveyed, 110
(7.2%) were found to have malaria, 46 due to p. falciparum, 63
due to plasmodium vivax, and 1 with a mixed infection. five
subjects did not meet the inclusion criteria. an additional 10
were lost to follow-up because of inaccessibility of their residences. of the remaining 95 patients, 40 were males and 55
females. the median age was 7 years, with the age distribution
as follows: 1–4 years, 16 subjects; 5–8 years, 45; 9–15 years,
30; and 115 years, 4. the geometric mean parasite density of
the 38 p. falciparum infections was 1401 (range, 160–19,840)
parasites/ml of blood and that of the 57 p. vivax infections was
250 (range, 80–5040).
human cyp2c19 genotypes. the cyp2c19 genotyping
of the 95 study subjects revealed 5 wt/wt, 22 wt/m1, 6 wt/m2,
29 m1/m1, 26 m1/m2, and 7 m2/m2. the frequency of the
cyp2c19m1 allele was 0.56, whereas that of cyp2c19m2 was
0.24 and that of cyp2c19wt was 0.20. the distribution of
individual genotypes followed the hardy-weinberg equilibrium.
the subjects with at least one wt allele were classified as ems
and those without any wt allele as pms. of the 33 (35%) identified ems, 13 had p. falciparum and 20 had p. vivax infections.

of the 62 pms, 25 had p. falciparum and 37 had p. vivax
infections.
ems and pms were comparable with regard to age profiles
and parasite densities of p. falciparum and p. vivax, respectively.
treatments and side effects. the  xxxd1672xxx  treatment dosage for the first 10 selected subjects was 500 mg daily (adult
relative dose). five of them complained of adverse events and
3 of these 5 would not continue the whole regimen. after the
daily dose was reduced to 300 mg, 37 (44%) of 85 patients still
complained of adverse events and 13 of these 37 interrupted
their treatments. the most frequently reported side effects were
gastrointestinal events: abdominal pain (37%) and vomiting
(24%). this was an unusually high prevalence of these symptoms, but there was no difference in the types or the frequency
of adverse events between pms and ems.
drug concentrations.  xxxd1672xxx  and cycloguanil concentrations in whole capillary blood of the 72 patients who took
300 mg of  xxxd1672xxx  daily for 3 days are summarized in table
1.  xxxd1672xxx  was detected in all samples but with relatively
higher concentrations in pms than in ems. in contrast, cycloguanil was significantly more often detected in ems than in

pms. within pms, cycloguanil was more often detected 3 h
after the first dose than after the third dose (p 5 .02 , x2 test).
the concentration-time profile of 4-chlorophenylbiguanide was
similar to that of cycloguanil; that is, the subjects who poorly
metabolized  xxxd1672xxx  to cycloguanil also poorly metabolized
the parent compound to 4-chlorophenylbiguanide (data not
shown).
therapeutic efficacy and parasite dhfr genotypes. a total
of 79 patients (31 p. falciparum– and 48 p. vivax–infected) completed the 3-day  xxxd1672xxx  treatment course. there was no significant difference in the therapeutic efficacy between pms and
ems for either of the two parasite infections (p 1 .5 , fisher’s
exact test) (table 2). similarly, there was no correlation between
cycloguanil concentrations and efficacy against either parasite
infection. no significant correlation was found between initial
parasite density and parasitologic response to treatment.
dhfr genotypes were determined for the isolates from 28 of
the 31 p. falciparum–infected patients (table 3). all isolates,
regardless of in vivo response, had the same two point mutations, normally associated with moderate resistance to dhfrinhibiting drugs [19].

discussion
the therapeutic efficacy of an antimalarial drug depends on
its bioavailability, the susceptibility of the parasites, and the
antimalarial immune status of the human host. we have investigated the efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  treatment in malaria patients living in an area in which malaria is endemic in relation
to the cyp2c19 pharmacogenetic and  xxxd1672xxx  pharmacokinetic profiles of the human host and the dhfr genetic profile
of the parasite.
the observed high frequency of cyp2c19 mutations confirms our previous findings on the same island [15], and the
pharmacokinetic data confirmed that they were associated with
poor metabolism of  xxxd1672xxx . the mean  xxxd1672xxx  concentrations were somewhat higher in pms than in ems, whereas the
cycloguanil concentrations were mostly below the detection
limit of the assay in pms, as expected.
the wide use of the drug for many years for chemoprophylaxis and its extremely rare reports of severe adverse events
indicate a generally low toxicity of  xxxd1672xxx . nevertheless, we
more often observed abdominal pain and vomiting during the
 xxxd1672xxx  treatment than generally thought. in contrast to our
findings, few side effects were observed in thai patients receiving even higher doses of  xxxd1672xxx , up to 1 g/day [20]. however,
when combined with chloroquine for chemoprophylaxis in caucasians [21] or  xxxd243xxx  for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in gabon [8], abdominal side effects similar
to those observed in our study have been reported. these differences in reported side effects are difficult to explain, but they
may possibly be attributed to genetic differences that are even
unrelated to the cyp2c19-related metabolic capacity.
 xxxd1672xxx  is normally not to be considered for monotherapy,
but we believed it to be justified, because all selected malaria
patients in this study were asymptomatic or had only mild
symptoms. a control group without treatment would have provided information on the degree of spontaneous “self-cure” in
the study group. however, the medical practice such that malaria patients do not undergo any treatment was not considered
to be ethically justified. some indirect evidence of relatively low
spontaneous remission rates of asymptomatic p. falciparum infections is available from studies on pyrimethamine efficacy in

977

schoolchildren with relatively high degrees of resistance in areas
of africa in which malaria is endemic. such studies have shown
up to 100% resistance (as shown by parasite prevalence) on
day 7 [22, 23]. these are significantly higher day 7 parasite rates
than those we observed in our vanuatu study after treatment
with  xxxd1672xxx , suggesting some “true” effect by  xxxd1672xxx  that,
as we have shown, does not differ between ems and pms.
in our study, only about one-third of the p. falciparum and
one-tenth of the p. vivax patients were parasite-positive on day
7 after a total 3-day dose corresponding to 900 mg of  xxxd1672xxx 
in an adult. recently, in thailand, after an adult 3-day dose
of 3000 mg of  xxxd1672xxx , 8 of 11 p. falciparum patients were
parasite-positive on day 7 [24]. this may reflect a higher degree
of parasite resistance to  xxxd1672xxx -cycloguanil in thailand, although a higher degree of malaria immunity in the patients in
vanuatu may also account for this difference.
we observed no correlation between therapeutic efficacy and
cyp2c19 genotypes. there was even a trend toward less efficacy in em patients (table 2). this was unexpected, since
cycloguanil has been reported to be much more active against
p. falciparum and is assumed to be critical for the antimalarial
efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis or treatment [2–4]. similarly
to our findings, in vitro activity of  xxxd1672xxx - xxxd243xxx  in
thai patients’ plasma samples did not depend on the metabolic
phenotype of  xxxd1672xxx , although this may also be explained
by the specific synergism between  xxxd243xxx  and  xxxd1672xxx 
[25]. the causal prophylactic effect of  xxxd1672xxx  alone appears
to also be unrelated to the metabolic phenotype according to
studies on malaria breakthroughs among swedish travelers [26]
or japanese volunteers in africa [27].
the high efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  treatment in pms could possibly be explained by a high activity of an alternative metabolite
through another metabolic pathway. however, the second
known metabolite, 4-chlorophenylbiguanide, cannot be used to
explain such an effect, since it follows the same pathway as
cycloguanil and, in addition, has shown a poor antimalarial
activity in vitro [3, 4].
all p. falciparum isolates in our study, regardless of in vivo
response, had the same dhfr genotype, suggesting moderate
resistance to both pyrimethamine and cycloguanil [19]. in a
previous in vitro study on p. falciparum isolates from papua
new guinea with the same dhfr genotype as in our study, cycloguanil ic90s were 80–320 nmol/l in the resistant parasites,
whereas the ic90s were <5.0 nmol/l in the sensitive parasites
with wt dhfr [18]. in early studies, the corresponding values for
 xxxd1672xxx  were ∼103–104 nmol/l for both cycloguanil-sensitive
and -resistant strains [3, 4]. this suggests that in our study, the
inhibitory blood levels of cycloguanil were attained only in
ems, whereas those of  xxxd1672xxx  were mostly attained in both
ems and pms (table 1).
our results in the pms thus suggest that the parent compound  xxxd1672xxx  may be more active than previously believed

978

kaneko et al.

and that it may have a significant intrinsic efficacy independent
of the metabolite cycloguanil. interestingly, a recent in vitro
study of p. falciparum transformed with human dhfr has
also suggested an intrinsic activity of  xxxd1672xxx  against a target
other than dhfr [28].
the therapeutic efficacy against p. vivax in our study was
higher than might have been expected in view of the reduced
sensitivity of p. vivax to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine observed
in thailand [29] and also confirmed in vanuatu (unpublished
data). the efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  was, however, documented in
the 1940s in a hong kong strain of p. vivax [30]. the possible
intrinsic efficacy of the parent compound  xxxd1672xxx  also against
p. vivax suggests that  xxxd1672xxx - xxxd243xxx , the recently developed antimalarial combination, may be used for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant p. vivax, which may represent a
growing problem in southeast asia and the pacific region [31]
and more generally for malaria without species identification.
a basis for resistance of p. vivax to pyrimethamine was recently
suggested following the isolation of the gene encoding the
dhfr of p. vivax [32], and there are pcr-based methods for
assessing the mutations in that gene [33], which might also be
associated with poor sensitivity to cycloguanil. we thus consider pursuing a further study to assess the p. vivax dhfr.
the efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  for treatment of or prophylaxis
against malaria has been considered to be due to a dhfr
inhibition by mainly cycloguanil and, therefore, to depend on
the bioavailability of the metabolite cycloguanil, that is, the
cyp2c19 pharmacogenetic profile of the human host and the
dhfr genetic profile of the parasite. however, we observed a
high antimalarial efficacy of  xxxd1672xxx  in a population with
high frequencies of the cyp2c19-related pm genotype and the
parasite genotype suggesting a moderate resistance to dhfrinhibiting drugs. we thus conclude that  xxxd1672xxx  should receive more attention as an important antimalarial and that its
therapeutic effectiveness may be more related to the parent
compound than to the metabolite cycloguanil.
