rational design of alkylene-linked bis-pyridiniumaldoximes as improved acetylcholinesterase reactivators.  to improve the potency of 2-pralidoxime (2-pam) for treating organophosphate poisoning, we dimerized 2-pam and its analogs according to wilson's pioneering work and the 3d structure of human acetylcholinesterase (hache) inactivated by  xxxd2393xxx . 1,7-heptylene-bis-n,n'-syn-2-pyridiniumaldoxime, the most potent of the alkylene-linked dimeric reactivators, was readily synthesized using bistriflate and is 100 times more potent than 2-pam in reactivating hache poisoned by  xxxd2393xxx . experimental and computational studies confirm that 2-pam in its biologically active form adopts the syn-i configuration. further, they suggest that the improved performance of dimeric oximes is conferred by two-site binding with one oxime pointing toward the diisopropyl ester at the catalytic site of hache and the other anchored at the peripheral site. this type of binding may induce a conformational change in the acyl pocket loop which modulates the catalytic site via a domino effect.
