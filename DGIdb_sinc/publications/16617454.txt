summary. airway pathologies have been comprehensively researched in adult asthma, but in
children, the extent of airway inflammation associated with episodic wheeze, often diagnosed as
asthma, has not been fully characterized. it is not clear whether persistent airway inflammation is
present in the absence of wheezing symptoms, and there is controversy regarding the role of age
and atopy. this study assessed cellular and cytokine markers of airway inflammation in
asymptomatic children with a history of episodic wheeze. children with a history of episodic
wheeze and cough (study group) and nonasthmatic patients requiring elective surgery (control
group) were recruited. all subjects in the study group had a history of significant episodic wheezing
(>2 episodes per year), and used only as-needed beta-agonist treatment. bronchoalveolar lavage
(bal) was obtained using bronchoscopic lavage (study group) and nonbronchoscopic lavage
(control group). differential cell counts of bal and flow cytometry were performed to identify
t-lymphocyte phenotypes, and intracellular cytokine profiles were measured after phorbol-12myristate 13-acetate (pma) stimulation of bal fluid t-cells. twenty-one children with a history of
2–12 episodes of wheeze per year and 21 nonasthmatic subjects without respiratory symptoms
were recruited. study and control subjects were matched for age (median age, 5 years) and
demographic characteristics. study subjects had higher ige levels, but their measurements were
still within normal range. no significant differences in bal differential cell counts were noted, and in
both groups, the majority of t-cells were cd3þ cd8þ, with a median cd4:cd8 ratio of 0.6. there
was no significant difference in t-cell expression of the activation markers hla-dr and cd25 (il-2
receptor), or in pma-induced production of the intracellular cytokines ifn-g, il-2, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and
il-10. the results of this study suggest that significant t-cell-driven airway inflammation is absent
in mild or nonatopic, asymptomatic children of this age group who have episodic wheeze. our
findings support asthma management guidelines that do not recommend long-term treatment of
this group of patients with anti-inflammatory medications. pediatr pulmonol. 2006; 41:577–

introduction

in australia, 1 in 4 children will have at least one
episode of wheeze per year, triggered in many cases by
viral infections. of children with wheezing, 75% have
infrequent episodes, 20% have frequent symptoms (at
least every 4 weeks), and 5% have daily persistent
symptoms.1 airway inflammation is presumed to be the
underlying pathological process associated with symptoms, but it is not clear whether inflammatory changes
persist during asymptomatic periods.
airway inflammation in adults with asthma has been
well-characterized, and t-cells are believed to play a key
role in the orchestration of the inflammatory process.2,3
inflammatory changes can be detected in asthmatics with
relatively sparse symptoms, and studies in adults with
mild asthma, using bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) and
mucosal biopsy, showed increased activation of tlymphocytes and excess production of th2 cytokines.4–6
raised mast-cell and eosinophil mediator production is
also present.

few comparable studies have been performed in
children with recurrent wheeze, who are often diagnosed
as mildly asthmatic. the extent and level of persistent
airway inflammatory changes in this group of patients are
controversial, and may depend on age and atopy.7,8 for
example, a study of infants with persistent wheeze

demonstrated significant influx of most inflammatory
cell types in bal,9 while a comparable study in older
children failed to find differences except in neutrophils.7
persistent airway inflammation in episodic wheeze is
important because it may influence whether corticosteroids will be prescribed, on the basis of evidence suggesting that early treatment of inflammation with daily
inhaled corticosteroids may prevent airway remodeling
and the development of irreversible structural change to
the airways.10
in this study, we conducted detailed assessments of
t-cell-driven airway inflammation in a group of patients
with episodic wheezing and cough who were asymptomatic at the time of the study. bal fluid was analyzed
to evaluate inflammatory cell numbers and detect t-cell
phenotypes, activation status, and intracellular cytokine
production.

materials and methods
patient groups

all children had been referred to monash medical
centre, a tertiary care center, for investigation of recurrent
respiratory symptoms including wheeze, cough, and
breathlessness. as part of their clinical assessment, they
underwent bronchoscopy, and children and their parents
were invited to participate in the study. although all
bronchoscopies were clinically indicated, bal was
performed for research. written consent was obtained
from a parent or guardian. a validated respiratory illness
questionnaire11 was administered to determine the
frequency of recent wheeze, and those children with
>2 episodes of wheeze in the past 12 months were
included in the study group. all children were asymptomatic for >4 weeks at the time of the study, and used only
as-needed beta-agonist medications. inhaled corticosteroids were taken irregularly by 8 patients (maximum dose,
400 mg  xxxd294xxx ), but had not been
used for >4 weeks prior to the study. nonasthmatic
subjects attending for elective surgery were recruited to
serve as controls, and written consent was obtained from a
parent or guardian. the children were matched for age,
and did not have a history of asthma or chronic respiratory
symptoms. exclusion criteria included children having
cardiothoracic surgery, those with congenital malformations, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, and proven
recurrent aspiration, and children who were born at less
than 37 weeks of gestation. subjects were also excluded
if they had an upper or lower respiratory tract infection
or treatment with oral or inhaled corticosteroids in the
preceding 4 weeks. the human research ethics committee of the southern health care network, monash
medical centre (melbourne, australia) approved the
study.

bronchoscopy and bal

recently, nonbronchoscopic bal was performed in
children presenting for elective surgical procedures.
several studies showed nonbronchoscopic bal to be a
safe and reliable technique, with no postoperative complications, adequate bal fluid return for analysis of inflammatory cells, and results comparable to conventional
bronchoscopic bal.7,12,13 normal reference values for
cell types and numbers in pediatric airways were derived
and found to be similar to adult values.7,12–14 although the
bal procedure samples predominantly luminal tissues,
the cells so obtained are deemed to provide an accurate
indication of tissue events in the airway wall itself.15

bronchoscopic lavage

no premedication was given, and beta-agonists were
not used within 2 hr of the procedure. anesthesia was
induced with halothane and maintained with a halothane/
oxygen mixture and propofol (1%) boluses of 1 mg/kg.
liquid  xxxd2482xxx  hydrochloride (2–4%) was applied
directly to the laryngeal and tracheal mucosa. flexible
bronchoscopy was performed transnasally or via a laryngeal mask airway, with the subject breathing spontaneously. the bronchoscope was wedged in a segmental or
subsegmental bronchus of the right middle lobe or right
lower lobe, and three aliquots of 1 ml/kg of saline up to
20 ml were instilled and immediately aspirated into a
specimen trap, using 150 mm hg negative pressure.
during anesthesia, heart rate and oxygen saturation were
continuously monitored, and an experienced pediatric
anesthetist was in attendance.

nonbronchoscopic lavage

the procedure was performed in volunteers undergoing
general anesthesia for elective surgery. premedication
with 30 mg/kg of paracetamol was given, and a relaxant
general anesthetic technique was used. immediately after
intubation, and with the child’s head in the midline, a
60-cm end-hole suction catheter (vygon s.a., ecouen,
france) was inserted into the endotracheal tube (et). the
catheter size was adjusted to the et diameter (8 french
catheter for size 3.5–5.0 et, and 10 french catheter for
size >5.5 et), and was advanced until wedged in a lung
segment. saline at room temperature was instilled (1 ml/kg
body weight up to 20 ml), and bal fluid was immediately
aspirated into a specimen trap (sherwood medical, st.
louis, mo), using 150 mm hg negative pressure and
a three-way tap (discofix, braun, melsungen ag,
germany). with the catheter remaining wedged in situ,
two further aliquots of 1 ml/kg saline were instilled and
aspirated, giving a total instilled volume of 3 ml/kg.14

absent inflammation in childhood wheeze

antibodies and reagents

rpmi-1640 and fetal calf serum (fcs) were obtained
from gibco (melbourne, australia). the fluorescenceactivated cell sorter (facs) wash consisted of phosphatebuffered saline (pbs), 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma,
melbourne, australia), and 0.01% sodium azide. paraformaldehyde, saponin,  xxxd2925xxx 
(pma),  xxxd2379xxx , and brefeldin a were obtained from
sigma.  xxxd2676xxx -cyanine 5 (cy5), cd8-alexa fluor 488,
and hla-dr-alexa fluor 488 were sourced from our
own laboratory. other antibodies used were cd4allophycocyanin (exalpha, maynard, ma), cd4-fitc
(dako, copenhagen, denmark), anti- xxxg1141xxx -fitc, il-4pe, il-2-fitc, il-10-pe,  xxxg1180xxx -pe, and cd8-pe/cy5
(pharmingen, franklin lakes, nj).
differential cell counts

a volume of 1–2 ml of retrieved specimen was
separated for differential cell counting. this was performed on 200 ml of unfiltered fluid, cytocentrifuged at 500g
for 5 min. two slides were fixed in 95% ethanol and
stained with papanicolaou reagent, and two were air-dried
and stained with may-grünwald-giemsa reagent. total
counts were done, and differential counts were performed
by counting 400 cells at high power and expressing them
as relative percentages. ciliated and squamous cells were
not counted.14
surface molecule and intracellular
cytokine detection

cells from bal fluid were washed twice in rpmi, and
resuspended in rpmi/10% fcs. total cell counts were
performed using a neubauer hemocytometer counting
chamber (weber, lutterworth, uk). depending on the
number of cells, the specimen was separated into two
equal volumes: one for cell surface staining, and the other
for t-cell cytokine measurements (see below). if enough
cells were not obtained, only one of the techniques was
performed, and hence study numbers are lower for studies
other than bal cell counts.
for surface labeling, the cells were spun and resuspended in 100-ml aliquots of facs wash in 1.5-ml
eppendorf tubes. appropriate antibodies were added at
the recommended volumes, and cells were incubated on
ice for 30 min, and then washed and centrifuged. cells
were suspended in 400 ml of facs wash, and left at 48c
before analysis by flow cytometry.
measurement of intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry is a validated measure of t-cell activation.16–18
bal cells were incubated in a 24-well tissue culture plate,
in 1 ml of rpmi/10% fcs plus pma (25 ng/ml),
 xxxd2379xxx  (1 mg/ml), and 10 mg/ml brefeldin a, using a
protocol modified from picker et al.18 preliminary studies

579

found that intracellular cytokines were not detectable in
unstimulated t-cells, and therefore cytokines were
measured only in stimulated cells. cells were incubated
for 3 hr at 378c and 5% co2, rinsed with facs wash,
centrifuged, and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde in
pbs and left on ice for 20 min. after centrifugation, cells
were resuspended in 0.2% saponin in pbs, left on ice for
5 min, and again centrifuged and resuspended in 100 ml of
0.2% saponin plus the recommended volume of antibodies. as stimulation with pma and  xxxd2379xxx  causes
reduction in the surface expression of cd4, anti-cd4 was
added after permeabilization to maximize staining. after
incubation on ice for 30 min and washing in 1 ml 0.2%
saponin, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of facs wash
for analysis.
flow cytometry

a moflo (cytomation) flow cytometer equipped with
cyclops summit software was used for studies. cells
were excited with a 488-nm argon ion laser and a 633-nm
hene laser. up to six parameters were collected at one
time, including forward and 908 light scatter, fitc or
alexa 488 green fluorescence, pe orange fluorescence,
pe-cy5 red fluorescence, and the 633-nm excited
allophycocyanin (apc) or cy5 red fluorescence. lymphocytes were gated by both size and fluorescence,
following labeling with  xxxd2676xxx  for cell surface staining
and anti-cd4 for cytokine staining, with at least 2,000
lymphocytes counted for surface staining, and 500 cd4þ
counts for cytokine staining. results are expressed as a
percentage of t-cells expressing the surface markers, and
cd4þ cells producing intracellular cytokines. fluorescence-positive cutoffs for each sample were determined
using the appropriate isotype control antibodies.
ige measurements

total ige was measured using an enzyme immunoassay, with a normal range of 0–150 katal units/l (ku/l) at
age 4–7 years (bipharco, brussels, belgium).
statistical analyses

previous studies indicated a standard deviation (sd) of
3.5 in cd25 and hla-dr expression on t-cells.6 a 50%
increase in t-cell activation (measured by cd25 and
hla-dr expression), an alpha of 0.05, and 80% power
required a sample size of 11 patients per group to
demonstrate a significant difference in children with
episodic wheeze compared to controls. for assessments
of ifn-g, repeated measurements indicated an sd of 7,19
and hence 12 study subjects (6 in the study group, and 6
controls) would be needed to detect a 50% increase in cells
positive for ifn-g, with 80% power at the 5% level. it was
not possible to calculate accurate study patient numbers

580

maclennan et al.

for il-4, and to account for this uncertainty as well as for
patients in whom enough bal may not have been
obtained, a total of 21 patients per group was recruited.
repeat facs measurement of intracellular cytokines on
the same bal samples had a coefficient of variation <3%.
statistical methods with independent groups were used.
the data were not normally distributed, and are presented
as medians and interquartile ranges. statistical comparisons were performed using the mann-whitney u-test
or unpaired t-test as appropriate, and p < 0.05 was
considered significant. minitab release version 10.2
for windows was used for data analysis.
results

t-cell subgroups and activation markers

cell surface markers were measured in 12 children with
episodic wheezing and 15 control subjects. similar
percentages of cells were identified as cd3þ cd4þ and
cd3þ cd8þ. the median cd4:cd8 ratio was 0.57
(range, 0.33–0.74) in patients with wheeze, and 0.61
(range, 0.41–0.87; p ¼ 0.8) in the control group.
t-cell activation markers hla-dr and cd25 (il-2
receptor) were also examined. again, no significant
differences between the two groups were found in the
percentages of t-cells expressing these surface receptors
(table 2). an analysis of steroid-naive subjects with
episodic wheeze gave similar results.

patient demographics

intracellular cytokine measurements

demographics of the two study groups are shown in
table 1. in total, 21 children between ages 3–8.6 years
(mean, 5 years) with episodic wheezing and 21 agematched controls undergoing general anesthesia were
recruited. mean total ige was higher in the study group
than in controls (25 vs. 7 ku/l, p < 0.01), but fell within
normal range for this age group.

intracellular cytokines were measured in 9 patients with
wheeze, and in 6 control subjects. after cells were
stimulated with pma and  xxxd2379xxx  in the presence of
brefeldin a, the percentage of cd4þ cells producing
detectable intracellular cytokines was determined. the
cytokine most frequently detected was ifn-g, but this was
not increased in either group. similar observations were
made for il-2, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and il-10 following stimulation
(fig. 1). again, an analysis of steroid-naive subjects with
episodic wheeze gave similar results.
a majority of cd3þ cells in bal were cd8þ, and
their cytokine expression following pma stimulation was
also assessed in a smaller group of patients (episodic
wheezing, n ¼ 6; controls, n ¼ 5). again, the only
cytokine present in significant numbers of cd3þ cd8þ
cells was ifn-g (episodic wheezing: median, 36%; range,
12–65%; controls: median, 47%; range, 2–58%; p > 0.5).
the cytokines il-2, il-4, and  xxxg1180xxx  also did not differ
significantly between groups.

bal and differential cell counts

no complications were observed during the bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic bal procedures or in the
postoperative period. the characteristics of the bal fluid
recovered and differential cell counts are shown in table 2.
there was no difference in volume of bal and number of
cells in bal obtained from subjects in the study groups.
cell populations sampled by bal revealed no evidence
of inflammation in subjects with episodic wheeze
(table 2). as expected, there was a predominance of
macrophages in bal (mean, 86% in both groups), and
although neutrophil counts were more variable, no
significant differences were found. there was also no
significant difference observed between study groups in
numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils. steroid-naive
subjects with episodic wheeze were separately analyzed,
and also had similar cellular profiles to the control group
(data not shown).

association of inflammatory
indices with serum ige

to assess whether levels of serum total ige may be
linked to the presence of inflammation, correlations with
various indices of inflammation were examined. no
significant link was observed (data not shown), but the

discussion

this study employed bal cell counts, t-cell activation
markers, and intracellular cytokine production to assess
airway inflammation in children with wheeze. no
evidence of persistent airway inflammation in asymptomatic young children with infrequent episodic wheeze
was found, and our findings in this particular cohort
suggest that significant bronchial inflammation is not
present during periods when symptoms are absent. it
implies that daily anti-inflammatory (preventer) therapies
may not be required in this particular group of patients,
who are often diagnosed as having mild, infrequent,
episodic asthma.
previous studies in children evaluated airway inflammation principally on the basis of cell populations in bal,
but the use of newer techniques to detect t-cell
intracellular cytokine production has not been reported.18
we used nonbronchoscopic techniques to obtain bal in a
control group of volunteers without airway symptoms, and
found no differences between methods of lavage with

wheeze. no significant differences were noted.

respect to bal volumes and total cells counts. bal was
analyzed employing laboratory methods, providing accurate measurements of inflammatory indices in peripheral
blood during both childhood and adult asthma.6,20 the
percentage of cd3þ t-cells in bal in both study groups
was comparable to t-cell numbers in a population of
children having bronchoscopy for the investigation of
stridor,14 normal bal cellular data by nonbronchoscopic12 and bronchoscopic21 procedures, and adult
reference values.5 moreover, similar inverse cd4:cd8
ratios in bal fluid (median, approximately 0.6 in both
groups) from nonasthmatic children of a similar age were
reported.14 the number of eosinophils in bal obtained
from the group with wheeze and the control group was
similar (and low), and suggests an absence of eosinophil
bronchitis, a condition that has been considered one of the
more consistent markers of asthmatic airway inflammation.22,23 numbers of other cell types also did not differ
between study groups. mast-cell numbers in bal may be
increased in asthma,24 and were not specifically identified.
however, a small percentage of cells was not accounted
for in the bal differential cell counts, and may possibly
have been mast cells or epithelial cells; their omission is
unlikely to mask changes in other cell types. overall,
using inflammatory-cell populations as a measure of
inflammatory burden, our results and that of a recent
bronchial biopsy study25 suggest the absence of significant
airway inflammation in children with mild asthma.
activation of t-cells is reflected by the expression of
surface membrane receptors such as hla-dr and cd25
( xxxg1175xxx ).6 significant increases were demonstrated
in the peripheral blood and bal of adult asthmatics, as
well as in the peripheral blood of children with asthma.20
in the latter study, 17 children were studied, aged 7–
16 years, with moderate to severe asthma. a significant
elevation in peripheral blood cd4þ cells expressing
cd25 and hla-dr, and cd8þ cells expressing cd25,
was found in asthmatics compared to controls. furthermore, activation was correlated with numbers of eosinophils and disease severity. based on these results, we
postulated that increased airway t-cell activation may

582

maclennan et al.

characterize children with episodic wheeze, as it appears
to do in children with chronic asthma.20 however, our
findings are similar to those reported by harmanci et al.,
who found no differences of cd25 and hla-dr expression in the peripheral blood of 32 stable, mild asthmatics
compared with controls.26
although the numbers of bal t-cells may be similar in
asthmatic and nonasthmatic persons, those with asthma
may be predisposed to produce predominantly th2 cytokines on stimulation. to assess the production of intracellular cytokines after stimulation with pma, t-cells
were examined by flow cytometry,14,17 employing a
method previously used by our group to demonstrate
differences in cytokine profiles in patients with bronchiectasis.27 median numbers of approximately 25% of
cd4þ t-cells and of cd8þ t-cells produced ifn-g, but
no differences were found between children with and
without episodic wheeze. il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and il-10 were
produced on stimulation by small numbers of t-cells
(medians, <5%) in both groups, again without detectable
differences. no comparable investigations of bal cells
were reported, although limited studies were done in
peripheral blood. noma et al. measured the production of
peripheral-blood ifn-g and il-4 in adolescent asthmatics
during exacerbations and at recovery, and found that
subjects with stable asthma produced little il-4.28 ifn-g
production was high compared with nonasthmatic ‘‘normal’’ subjects, and it was concluded that increased ifn-g
in stable asthma suppressed il-4 production. our results
are consistent with this possibility, if both the nonasthmatic controls and subjects with episodic wheeze
represent a group of ‘‘normal’’ nonasthmatic individuals.
it should be remembered that cytokine production might
originate from sources other than t-cells, such as
macrophages, eosinophils, and airway epithelium. studies
in bal demonstrated that macrophages spontaneously
release  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ) in infants with
wheeze,29 and  xxxg1965xxx  (ecp) is increased in some infant wheezers.30
several factors may influence the interpretation of our
results. first, there is evidence that wheezing during
childhood may be a heterogeneous condition, and that
different forms of wheezing may be associated with
diverse risk factors and prognosis. stein et al. described
three phenotypes: transient early wheezing, nonatopic
wheezing, and ige-associated wheeze/asthma, the latter
associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (ahr), peak
flow variability, and markers of atopy.31 it was not possible
to assess ahr or peak flow variability in this study, but
total serum ige was higher in the study group, suggesting
that at least some patients with wheeze were drawn from
the third group. however, ige elevations in the study
group were modest (median, 25 ku/l) and fell within
normal range, implying that most patients were of a
nonatopic or mildly atopic phenotype.31 second, we

considered that prior use of inhaled corticosteroids may
have suppressed airway inflammation, and hence we
performed analyses of steroid-naive subjects. no differences were observed. third, inflammatory indices may
have been overlooked, because study and control subject
numbers were too low to detect differences in t-cell
cytokine production. however, power calculations for
ifn-g confirmed adequate numbers, and other measurements of inflammation were very similar in both groups.
for example, t-cell numbers were approximately the
same, and activation markers such as cd25 were almost
identical. it is also possible that the techniques used to
quantify t-cell activation and cytokine production were
not of the requisite sensitivity, but similar studies using the
same methods found differences in both adults and
children with asthma6,20 and in other diseases.27 finally,
cellular findings in bal may not accurately reflect airway
tissue events revealed by direct tissue sampling using
mucosal biopsy. a number of studies reported that the
overall correlation between bal and biopsy methods was
reasonably good, and it seems unlikely that significant
airway-wall inflammation will not be reflected in studies
of bal cells.5,15,23
in conclusion, we found no evidence of persistent
t-cell-driven airway inflammation in bal obtained from
young, predominantly mild or nonatopic children with
episodic wheeze. it was suggested that daily use of inhaled
glucocorticosteroids should be considered in wheezy
children to reduce chronic airway inflammation and
the possibility of airway remodeling, and to improve
pulmonary function.10 the results of our study provide
some support for the current guidelines of the british
thoracic society32,33 and australian national asthma
campaign,34,35 which state that long-term daily antiinflammatory medication is not indicated in children with
infrequent episodic wheeze.
