the role of gonadotropins in ovulation induction
david l. olive, md
new haven, connecticut
currently two types of gonadotropin preparations are commercially available for ovulation induction:
 xxxd2564xxx  and follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh). proper use of these agents is directed by many
factors. concern about the fsh- xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  ratio and the bioconsistency of the preparations
suggests the use of fsh in most situations. regimens based on short-term incremental increases in
gonadotropin dose (based on frequent sonographic and biochemical monitoring) seem to produce the
highest pregnancy rates, individualization of the patient's ovulation induction course on the basis of
history of medication use and the reasons for ovulation induction therapy are also essential to optimize
outcomes. (amj obstetgynecol1995;172:759-65.)

key words:  xxxd2564xxx , ovulation induction, unexplained infertility, follicle-stimulating
hormone,  xxxd3477xxx 

ovulation induction has rapidly become an important
aspect of gynecologic care in the united states. however, significant variations exist in approach among
practitioners. faced with a plethora of scientific articles,

clinical opinions, and theoretic extrapolations, the clinician wishing to adopt these techniques is often in a
quandary.
this article addresses issues that commonly arise in
such situations. specifically, the question of what type of
gonadotropin preparation is optimal will be reviewed
first. this will be followed by an analysis of which
patient populations are appropriately treated by gonadotropin therapy. finally, a review of the factors
critical to optimal administration of this class of drugs
will be provided.

gonadotropin formulations
currently only two types of gonadotropin preparations are commercially available for ovulation induction
in the united states: (1)  xxxd2564xxx , a mixture of
equivalent international units of follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  (lh), and (2)  xxxd3477xxx , or fsh, a relatively purified gonadotropin
preparation with trace amounts of lh. both agents are
derived from urine, with  xxxd3477xxx  undergoing the
additional step of the extraction of lh from the preparation. thus both medications would be expected to
contain identical isoforms of fsh and a similar array of
urinary protein contaminants; only the absence of significant lh bioactivity distinguishes the latter drug.
most pharmacologic studies show little difference
between the two preparations. if daily levels are comp a r e d in women receiving equivalent doses of either
 xxxd2564xxx  or  xxxd3477xxx , no difference can be
ascertained in serum gonadotropin concentrations of
lh, fsh, and lh-fsh ratio.' this lack of disparity i s a
result of the relatively short half-life of urinary lh.
because of the rapid metabolism of the molecule, the
presence of administered lh will not be easily recognized in a study protocol involving single daily gonadotropin determinations. however, if more frequent
blood sampling is carried out, an observably higher
serum lh level is seen in the first 8 hours after
menotropin injection. 2 conversely, a lowering of serum
lh is initially seen with  xxxd3477xxx .
is a follicular phase elevation in lh, even transiently,
of any clinical significance? one way to attempt to
answer this question is to examine the potential detrimental effect of endogenous lh on different aspects of
human reproduction. it is possible that elevated lh
might be detrimental to either the oocyte or the endometrium. several investigators have examined progesterone levels in the late follicular phase of women
undergoing in vitro fertilization and have found that

pregnancy rate is inversely related to the progesterone
level at the time of human  xxxd2228xxx 
(hcg) administration (table i)?' 4 interestingly, progesterone levels seen in poor outcome groups, while
higher than those seen in groups with higher pregnancy rates, are still in the normal range in the late
follicular phase.
the primary reason for variation in progesterone
levels may be differences in lh levels. in a study by
silverberg et al., 4 patients were down-regulated with a
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonist administered in the midluteal phase and continued until
hcg administration. t h e lh levels were, as expected,
quite low (table ii), and yet even small differences in
lh values in the late follicular phase a p p e a r e d to be
substantial enough to create clinically significant differences in progesterone levels. thus adverse reproductive
effects may not be t h e result of chronically elevated
levels of lh but rather of small elevations of lh at
precise and critical times within the follicular phase.
if occasional lh elevation is indeed detrimental to
reproduction, a difference in outcome would be expected in clinical trials that compare  xxxd2564xxx  and
 xxxd3477xxx  administration. unfortunately, few such
studies exist, and no randomizefl trials with adequate
numbers of patients have been performed. however,
some clues may be extracted from available data.
in a randomized trial comparing  xxxd2564xxx  and
fsh for ovulation induction in women with polycystic
ovarian disease, there was no difference in pregnancy
rates between the groups. 5 unfortunately, the total
n u m b e r of pregnancies achieved was quite small. data
have also been accumulated from a comparison of
 xxxd2564xxx  and fsh in patients undergoing in vitro
fertilization (ivf). in a nonrandomized survey of
women receiving only one of the two drugs, researchers
matched subjects by indication for assisted reproduction. pregnancy rates were slightly but not statistically

products is bioconsistency. ideally when we administer
a medication, it should behave in a predictable and
reproducible manner. this is possible only if there is no
variation in the active content of the p r e p a r a t i o n from
lot to lot. lack of bioconsistency produces one more
unknown clinical variable for the practitioner and consequently less control over the eventual outcome.
urinary preparations of gonadotropins suffer from
the presence of a large number of urinary contaminants,
many of which may affect folliculogenesis and none of
which are consistent in presence or quantity.  xxxd2564xxx  have significant lh activity, some of which may be
from the presence of hcg, 9 which has a half-life nine
times that of lh and is present in highly inconsistent
amounts from preparation to preparation. such fluctuating activity levels create a level of bioinconsistency that
increases the difficulty of predicting follicular response;
theoretically, purified products lacking lh activity and
(preferably) any urinary contaminants would be more
bioconsistent and predictable, enabling the clinician
to make better informed decisions regarding administration.
one concern commonly expressed is that with declining lh content in gonadotropin preparations, there
will be an alteration in the estradiol levels associated
with follicular growth. although no such discrepancy
has been seen between  xxxd2564xxx  and  xxxd3477xxx ,
it may be that highly purified or recombinant fsh
products will produce a lower level of serum estradiol
for equivalent follicular response. in a recent unpublished trial comparing standard  xxxd3477xxx  therapy
with that of a highly purified fsh formulation, the
highly purified gonadotropin p r o d u c e d an estradiol
concentration that was 10% lower than the standard
formula in the first cycle of treatment (personal communication). although important, this variation in predicted estradiol pales c o m p a r e d with o t h e r factors affecting estradiol calculations. for example, many radioimmunoassays or enzyme-linked immunoassays exist
for estradiol; although they are precise tests, their
accuracy is questionable. one study that compared five
different testing kits found variations in readings of

fivefold to eightfold for a given known estradiol standard. i° thus the variance expected from differing gonadotropin preparations should be substantially less
than that seen with estradiol assays themselves.
an exception to the fsh preference rule is the
patient with severe hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
in this patient with no endogenous lh, the administration of a purified fsh preparation produces substandard follicular development. 11 however, such patients are rare in most clinical practices; for all other
patients, highly purified single gonadotropin preparations of fsh are more bioconsistent, are at least as
efficacious, and thus are the formulation of choice.
clinical gonadotropin use
the original indication for gonadotropin use was the
patient who was anovulatory. however, as gonadotropin
administration has become safer as a result of improved
monitoring techniques and a wider experience with
controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, the clinical indications for use have gradually e x p a n d e d (table iv).
with an e x p a n d e d list of uses, it has become clear
that the ultimate end points for treatment are not the
same in all patients. the end point that seems to vary
by indication is the number of ovulations p r o d u c e d p e r
induction cycle. unfortunately, not all follicles observed
on ultrasound examination result in ovulation after the
administration of hcg. to determine the relationship
between follicular size and rate of ovulation, we recently
classified follicles by mean diameter at the time of hcg
administration and then followed their course ultrasonographically to determine if ovulation occurred. 12
t h e results can be seen in table v. small follicles, with
diameters of 14 m m or less, rarely ovulated, whereas
follicles greater than 20 m m nearly always did so. using
these rates of ovulation, it becomes possible to use
vaginal ovarian imaging to predict the number of ovulations likely if hcg is administered. this method of
estimating ovulations can be used during the stimulation cycle to determine if the goal set for the induction
is likely to be met if and when hcg administration is
provided.

volume 172, number 2, part 2
amj obstet gynecol

once the number of ovulations becomes a predictable calculation, the approach to controlled ovarian
hyperstimulation can be varied to meet the goals of
each patient. the first indication for therapy listed in
table iv is ovulatory dysfunction. a basic principle in
the treatment of infertility with ovulatory dysfunction is
that the more severe the dysfunction, the more likely
the patient is to become pregnant once it is corrected.
stated another way, the greater the severity of a single
infertility factor, the less likely it is that a second factor
is involved. the situation with the severe chronic anovnlator is analogous to that of the azoospermic husband or the patient with bilateral tubal obstruction:
correction of the primary problem often allows the
couple's fertility to approach normal. thus in patients
who are chronically anovulatory, the goal of ovulation
induction is to produce only one or two ovulations
(ovum released into the reproductive tract); more ovulations would be expected to produce a high rate of
multifetal gestation.
conversely, patients who are oligoovulatory and ovulate six times a year have had past opportunities to
conceive but have been unsuccessful; thus it is highly
likely that a second subfertility factor is involved. for
these patients a more aggressive course of controlled
ovarian hyperstimulation is required, analogous to
treatment of the patient with unexplained infertility.
a similar range is seen among women suffering from
luteal phase defect. in patients with out-of-phase biopsies on multiple evaluations or with disparities of 5 or 6
days between expected and actual endometrial maturation, there can be little doubt that a fertilized oocyte has
had little opportunity to encounter an endometrium
adequate for implantation. ~ when the condition is
correctable by gonadotropin therapy, one or two ovulations per induction cycle should be needed to achieve
pregnancy, whereas more ovulations run a risk of multifetal gestation. in a patient with a questionable diagnosis (e.g., one biopsy, out of phase by 2 or 3 days), a
more aggressive approach similar to that in a patient
with unexplained infertility is recommended.
a third indication for gonadotropin therapy is unexplained infertility. by definition, the problem(s) preventing conception are unknown, and thus there is no
way to directly attack the obstacles. instead, the goal of
therapy is to reduce the time until conception. this
technique of "compressing time" from, for example, 2
years of persistent attempts at pregnancy to 2 months
can be achieved by increasing the number of gametes in
the reproductive tract each menstrual cycle. male gametes are maximized by intrauterine insemination; female gametes may be increased by aggressive controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.~-3 the goal here is to
safely produce four to six ovulations per induction
cycle, thus increasing the opportunity for conception

olive 763

fourfold to sixfold. it is unlikely that large multifetal
gestations will result, because the risk of a given oocyte
resulting in pregnancy is quite low; the chance of four
conceptions in six ovulations, while finite, is still remarkably low.
a controversial indication for gonadotropin therapy
is male factor infertility. the male problem is not
directly attacked: the concept is to increase the number
of female gametes available for the relatively few male
gametes present. here again the goal is to induce four
to six ovulations per induction cycle.
another use for gonadotropin therapy is the need for
"time-limited conception," that is, those couples who
cannot endure lengthy attempts at conception. examples include women who are 40 years old or more at
initial presentation, patients with a chronic disease and
in need of conceiving before the institution of therapy,
and families in the military in which a spouse is to be
transferred to a remote location. in this instance, the
goal is to compress time by creating multiple ovulations. however, these couples may be inherently fertile,
which would produce a substantial risk of multifetal
pregnancy. to balance these two conflicting issues, a
moderate approach to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is instituted, with a goal of three or four ovulations per induction cycle.
the final group undergoing gonadotropin therapy is
made up of patients experiencing assisted reproductive
technologies. these technologies, such as ivf, gamete
intrafallopian transfer, and zygote intrafallopian transfer, allow an aggressive approach to treatment, because
hyperstimulation is infrequent after follicular aspiration, and the chance of multifetal gestation is controlled
by the number of embryos or oocytes transferred. thus
as many as 20 or 30 follicles are not uncommon in such
procedures, and estradiol levels up to threefold higher
than those seen in routine gonadotropin use are generally tolerated, l~

administration of gonadotropins
several basic principles must be applied to gonadotropin administration to maximize the effectiveness of
such therapy. the first is flexibility in administration.
the older concepts of fixed doses have been discredited. most modern practitioners agree that the greater
the flexibility in administration, the better the treatment results.
the basic theory of flexible administration involves
either increasing or decreasing daily gonadotropin dosage for specific indications. increasing the daily dose
will continue to stimulate the leading follicles in the
growing cohort but in addition will provide sufficient
fsh to allow growth of small and midsize follicles. thus
a larger cohort of follicles will enlarge and mature. this
technique is appropriate when an adjustment is neces-

sary to increase the n u m b e r of mature follicles to meet
the predetermined goal of ovulations in the cycle.
decreasing the dose of gonadotropins will cause preferential growth of leading follicles without adequate
fsh to sustain the growth of the trailing follicles,
leading to their eventual atresia. thus this method is
used to decrease the total n u m b e r of follicles in the
cohort. this approach is analogous to selection in the
normal menstrual cycle, in which declining fsh levels

create an adverse environment for all except the most
advanced follicles.
a second principle of gonadotropin dosage is that
individual patients vary in their response to medication
from cycle to cycle. this is particularly true in patients
with polycystic ovarian disease) 5 fig. 1 shows six different patients going through multiple gonadotropin induction cycles. a review of fsh values shows that in
some patients the level required to initiate follicular

volume 172, number 2, part 2
amj obstet gynecol

growth is clearly demarcated and consistent. o n the
other hand, several patients have significant variation in
the fsh threshold required for follicular response. this
illustrates the need for flexibility in administration to
achieve optimal results.
a final principle involves the effect of down-regulation with gnrh analogue therapy. fig. 2 illustrates
serum fsh levels in patients treated with gonadotropins alone as opposed to those treated with gonadotropins plus a gnrh analogue. with a given increase in
administered gonadotropins, the increase in serum
fsh is twice as large in the patients previously treated
with gnrh analogue therapy compared with those not
down-regulated.'4 thus increasing the dose of gonadotropins when an adjuvant gnrh analogue has been
used will produce a steeper increase in fsh levels than
with routine gonadotropin use.
conclusions

gonadotropin therapy for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is not a routine procedure that allows a
cookbook approach. the key to success is the ability to
evaluate each patient as an individual. it is important
not to succumb to standardized protocols, not to use
fixed dosages, not to use a formulation simply out of
habit, and not to treat each patient as if she were
chronically anovulatory.
many different types of patients require gonadotropin therapy in the 1990s, each of whom requires a
unique and thoughtful approach to produce optimal
results. it is critical that clinicians practicing gonadotropin ovulation induction use all the tools available to
them, that they routinely survey the medical literature,
and that they adapt the new and exciting advances in
the field to the care of the individual patient. only then
can maximal effectiveness with minimal adverse effects
be anticipated.
