a novel missense mutation, g663a, in exon 5 of the erythroid-specific ␦- xxxd148xxx 
synthase gene ( xxxg123xxx ) was identified in a japanese male with pyridoxine-responsive
sideroblastic anemia. activity of the mutant ␦- xxxd148xxx  synthase protein expressed in vitro was 15.1% compared with the normal control, but was increased up to
34.5% by the addition of pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate, consistent with the clinical response of
the patient to pyridoxine treatment. the same mutation was also detected in genomic
dna from the oral mucosal membrane of the patient; however, it was not detected in
other family members. these findings suggest that this g663a mutation is responsible
for sideroblastic anemia in the proband, and may be an index mutation in this pedigree.

introduction

the erythroid–specific ␦- xxxd148xxx  synthase
( xxxg123xxx ) gene, which is located at xp11.21 [1], is
thought to be responsible for x-linked sideroblastic anemia (sa). to date, ∼20 different mutations of the  xxxg123xxx 
gene have been reported in various pedigrees of x-linked
sa [2–4]. however, no mutation of the  xxxg123xxx  gene in
noninherited sa has been reported. we report here a
novel mutation of the  xxxg123xxx  gene in a patient with
pyridoxine-responsive sa, which is likely an index mutation in this pedigree.

proband was an eight-month-old japanese boy who

mality. his family members showed normal complete
blood cell count (cbc), including normal rdw. the
anemia of the patient was restored almost completely to
normal (hb 11.4 g/dl) by oral pyridoxine treatment for 2
months (50 mg/day).
sequence analysis of the  xxxg123xxx  gene of
the proband

genomic dna was extracted by using the genomic
dna extraction system (dna extraction wb kit, wako
corp., osaka, japan). each exon of the  xxxg123xxx  gene was
amplified by using the specific primers as described previously [5]. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products
were subcloned into pgem-t vector (promega, madison, wi), and sequence analysis was performed.
alas activity of the mutant protein

mutation was introduced into human  xxxg123xxx  cdna
by site-directed mutagenesis. a cdna fragment encoding the catalytic domain of  xxxg123xxx  was fused to the
3⬘-end of  xxxg1073xxx  gene. the bacterially
expressed fusion protein was purified by using a glutathione sepharose 4b affinity column (pharmacia biotech). enzymatic activity of the purified protein was determined as described previously [5].
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization
(aso) analysis

amplicons from exon 5 were spotted onto a nylon
membrane and hybridized with the end-labelled mutant
oligonucleotide; 5⬘-gcatgagccaacaccctc, or
the normal oligonucleotide; 5⬘-gcatgagccgacaccctc. a membrane was then washed, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film [6].
restriction analysis

mismatch pcr was performed by using genomic
dna of peripheral blood cells, or the oral mucosal membrane cells of the proband, as well as peripheral blood
cells of his family members with 5⬘-agaaacaggatcacacctac, and 5⬘-tcactgtgtggcttgcaagacctgagggag as the sense and antisense
primer, respectively. after digestion with hinfi, amplicons were electrophoresed on a 2.0% agarose gel and
stained with ethidium bromide.
results and discussion

sequence analysis of the proband’s dna from his
peripheral blood revealed a point mutation, g663a, in
exon 5 (fig. 1a). to identify the mutation in his family
members, aso analysis was performed. the results
clearly showed that, although the proband carries the
mutation, other family members of the proband do not

mismatch pcr analysis. the mismatch pcr product from a
mutant allele is resistant to hinfi digestion, so that the size
is not affected by digestion with hinfi (176bp). in contrast,
the mismatch pcr product from a normal allele is restricted
by hinfi (146bp), since it has an artificial hinfi site. lane 1,

(fig. 1b). for further confirmation, mismatch pcr was
carried out. since mismatch pcr introduces a new hinfi
site only into the amplicon from exon 5 of the normal
allele, amplicons from the normal, but not from the mutant allele should be shorter by 30 bp by digestion with
hinfi. in fact, amplicons from all family members of the
proband were 30 bp shorter than that of the proband with
hinfi digestion (fig. 1c). these results are consistent
with the findings by aso analysis. furthermore, mis-

match pcr demonstrated that the amplicon from the oral
mucosal membrane of the proband also carries the same
mutation. the result of mismatch pcr was also confirmed by sequence analysis (data not shown). these
findings indicate that g663a mutation identified in the
proband may be an index (or a founder) mutation in this
pedigree, or a somatic mutation.
we then examined the enzymatic activity of the mutant  xxxg123xxx  protein by bacterial expression that carries
an amino acid substitution, r204q, that is produced by
the g663a mutation. activities of the wild-type and the
mutant  xxxg123xxx  protein expressed in escherichia coli in
the absence of plp were 8181 ± 1118 nmol ala/h/mg
protein, and 1233 ± 231 nmol ala/h/mg protein, respectively (n ⳱ 3, p < 0.001), while activities of the wildtype and the mutant  xxxg123xxx  in the presence of plp (200
␮m) were 10767 ± 2191 nmol ala/h/mg protein and
3713 ± 319 nmol ala/h/mg protein, respectively (n ⳱
3, p < 0.001). thus the specific activity of the mutant
 xxxg123xxx  was 15.1% and 34.5% of the wild-type enzyme,
in the absence and the presence of plp, respectively.
this finding is consistent with the fact that oral pyridoxine treatment in vivo in the patient remarkably improved
anemia, and clearly establishes the fact that g663a mutation of the  xxxg123xxx  gene is responsible for the pyridoxine-responsive sa in the patient.
