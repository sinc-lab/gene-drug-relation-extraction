abstract
the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics (pk) of the novel  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2) selective inhibitor  xxxd2517xxx  (prexige® ), so that dose recommendations for clinical use can be provided. this was an open-label,
single dose, case-controlled study in which eight subjects with liver cirrhosis classed as moderate hepatic impairment (child–pugh score:
7–9) and eight demographically-matched healthy subjects received a single oral 400 mg dose of  xxxd2517xxx . routine safety assessments
were made and blood samples were taken for determination of  xxxd2517xxx  concentrations for 96 h post dose. the ex vivo binding
of  xxxd2517xxx  to plasma proteins was determined pre dose and at 2 and 12 h post dose. an analysis of variance was used to detect
differences in pk parameters (auc, cmax and tmax ) between the treatment groups. there were no significant differences between subjects
with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects in the area under the  xxxd2517xxx  plasma concentration–time curves (auc0–∞ ):
29.2±6.7 ␮g h ml−1 versus 28.7±6.3 ␮g h ml−1 . the rate of absorption of  xxxd2517xxx  was not significantly altered by hepatic impairment
based on cmax and tmax . the protein-bound fraction of  xxxd2517xxx  exceeded 98% both in healthy control subjects and in those with moderate
hepatic insufficiency. a single dose of 400 mg  xxxd2517xxx  was well tolerated. in conclusion, no dose adjustments appear to be required
when  xxxd2517xxx  is administered to patients with either mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

1. introduction
 xxxd2517xxx  (prexige® ), chemically known as 2-[(2fluoro-6-chlorophenyl)amino]-5-methyl-benzeneacetic acid,
is a novel  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) selective inhibitor
in clinical development for the treatment of osteoarthritis,
rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. the anticipated dosing
for  xxxd2517xxx  is 100–200 mg once daily (od) for chronic
use, and 400 mg od for the short-term treatment of acute
pain [1–4]. the selective inhibition of cox-2, as opposed
to non-selective inhibition of both cox-1 and cox-2 by
traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids),
is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects [5–11].
when taken orally by healthy humans,  xxxd2517xxx  demonstrates good bioavailability of 74%, is absorbed rapidly with

peak plasma concentrations occurring at approximately
2 h post dose, and is cleared from the plasma with a half
life in the range of 3–6 h [12,13]. in plasma,  xxxd2517xxx 
is highly bound >98% to albumin. exposure (area under
the concentration–time curve; auc) increases in a dose
proportional manner over the range 25–800 mg [13] and
in an underproportional manner at doses >800 mg [14].
upon repeated administration,  xxxd2517xxx  rapidly reaches
steady state with no accumulation over time [14]. cox-2
selectivity is maintained at doses up to 1200 mg [13–15].
in a study to characterise the absorption, metabolism, disposition and mass balance of [14 c]- xxxd2517xxx , unchanged
drug in plasma accounted for 81–91% of radioactivity up to
2.5 h post dose, suggesting a modest first-pass metabolism
[16]. unchanged drug was the major circulating component
in plasma, accounting for 43% of the auc0–24 h [16]. excretion involved both renal (54% of the radioactive dose)
and faecal (43% of the radioactive dose) routes.  xxxd2517xxx  was extensively metabolised prior to excretion with

182

little unchanged drug in urine (3.3% of the dose) or faeces
(2% of the dose). the three primary metabolites identified
thus far are 4 -hydroxy-, 5-carboxy- and 4 -hydroxy-5carboxy- xxxd2517xxx , which are subsequently conjugated
to glucuronide prior to excretion. only the 4 -hydroxylumiracoxib has been shown to be active, having similar
potency and cox-2 selectivity to the parent molecule.
plasma and synovial exposure to this metabolite is around
10% of the parent molecule, suggesting this metabolite is
unlikely to contribute significantly to efficacy [16,17].
in vitro studies using liver microsomes showed that  xxxd2517xxx  was metabolised primarily by the cytochrome
p450 isoform cyp2c9 [18]. depending on their severity,
hepatic diseases can affect drug absorption and disposition
as well as efficacy and toxicity. for example, diseases affecting liver architecture or function can alter hepatic blood
flow and perfusion, cause hypoalbuminaemia, influence renal function or impair hepatic drug-metabolising enzymes
including microsomal oxydases [19,20]. given the central
role of the liver in the clearance of  xxxd2517xxx , the potential exists for hepatic impairment to adversely affect  xxxd2517xxx  pharmacokinetics (pk) and selectivity.
in accordance with the us food and drug administration
guidance for pk studies in patients with impaired hepatic
function [21] the present study was performed with a reduced
study design. the objective was to assess the pk, tolerability,
and safety of a single oral 400 mg dose of  xxxd2517xxx  in
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared to
demographically matched healthy subjects, so that dosing
recommendations for its use in hepatically impaired patients
could be provided.

2. methods
2.1. subjects
subjects between 18 and 70 years with child–pugh scores
between 7 and 9 were included in the study if they had physical signs consistent with a clinical diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (i.e. liver firmness to palpation, splenic enlargement,
spider angioma, palmar erythema, parotid hypertrophy, testicular atrophy, and gynaecomastia). no patients with stage
ii encephalopathy within 6 months prior to the start of the
study or with moderate-to-severe ascites were included.
subjects were to be in otherwise good health as determined
by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ecg), and laboratory tests at screening.
healthy control subjects were matched to the subjects with
moderate hepatic impairment for gender, age (±5 years),
body weight (±10%), height (±5 cm), and smoking history.
all subjects were required to be within −15 and +20%
of normal body weight for their body type. subjects were
excluded from study participation if they smoked more
than 20 cigarettes per day, tested positive for hiv, or had a
platelet count <50 × 109 l−1 or polymorphonuclear count

<1500 × 106 l−1 . female subjects could not be pregnant;
they were required to be post-menopausal for at least 2 years,
or surgically sterilised at least 6 months prior to starting the
study, or using a double-barrier method of contraception.
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment were excluded from study participation if they had: a ≥50% worsening of serum bilirubin or prothrombin time within 21
days prior to starting the study; prothrombin time >18 s; evidence of progressive liver disease as indicated by elevated
liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and gammaglutamyl transferase; or evidence of current drug or alcohol
abuse. healthy subjects were excluded if they tested positive for hepatitis b or c or had a history of drug or alcohol
abuse within the 12 months prior to starting the study. in
the healthy subjects, all over-the-counter drugs were to be
discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior, and prescription
drugs 1 month prior, to study initiation. subjects with hepatic impairment continued to take medications prescribed
to treat the clinical abnormalities of hepatic insufficiency
(including, but not limited to, furosemide,  xxxd3238xxx  and
lactulose). gastric antacids, anti-secretory agents, or agents
that might induce or inhibit cyp2c9 were not allowed to
be taken within 2 weeks prior to starting the study.
all subjects provided written informed consent prior to
study participation. the study was conducted at clinical
pharmacology associates (miami, fl, usa), and the southern institutional review board approved the study. the investigation was carried out in accordance with the principles
of the declaration of helsinki as revised in 1996 [22].
2.2. study design
the study was carried out in an open-label, single dose,
case-controlled design. subjects who met study eligibility
criteria were enrolled at a screening visit within 21 days
prior to starting the study. the subjects were administered
a single 400 mg oral dose of  xxxd2517xxx  after an overnight
fast of at least 10 h in duration and they continued to fast for
2 h post dose. pk samples for  xxxd2517xxx  were obtained
between 0 and 96 h. subjects were confined to the study
center from at least 12 h prior to study drug administration
until the final pk sample was obtained.
except for medications prescribed to treat the clinical abnormalities of hepatic insufficiency and those required to
treat adverse events (aes), no concomitant medications were
allowed from screening until study completion. no alcohol
could be consumed within 72 h prior to the first dose of
study medication or until after study completion. the intake
of xanthine-containing food or beverages (e.g. coffee, tea,
chocolate) was to be discontinued 48 h prior to dosing and
not resumed until after leaving the centre.
2.3. pk assessments
venous blood samples were collected into lithium heparin
tubes pre dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and

j. kalbag et al. / pharmacological research 50 (2004) 181–186

96 h post dose. plasma was prepared by centrifugation within
30 min of blood collection and was frozen (≤−20 ◦ c) until
analysis. plasma  xxxd2517xxx  concentrations were measured
at novartis pharmaceuticals corp. (east hanover, nj, usa)
by means of a validated lc/ms method with a limit of quantification (loq) of 10 ng ml−1 . acidified plasma (0.2 ml)
was extracted using methylene chloride:pentane, 1:2 v/v.
the organic layer was dried under a stream of nitrogen
and the samples reconstituted in 0.2 ml of water:methanol
(70:30). the high-performance lc system consisted of a
metasil basic 5␮ 150 mm × 2.0 mm (id) hplc column
with a metaguard 2.0 mm metasil basic 5␮ precolumn,
column temperature 45 ◦ c; solvent a: 0.05% trifluoroacetic
acid in water, solvent b: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in
methanol (linear gradient), flow rate 0.2 ml min−1 and an injection volume of 30 ␮l. for ms, single ion monitoring was
employed, with a positive ion mode and multiplier at 650 v.
assay performance was assessed on the basis of a 6-point
quality control concentration range from 10 to 5000 ng ml−1 .
between-run coefficients of variation were ≤9.7% and
analytical recoveries ranged from 91.0 to 100.5%.
conventional non-compartmental pk parameters were derived from concentration versus time data. such parameters included the peak blood concentration (cmax ), time to
reach the peak blood concentration (tmax ) and the elimination half life (t1/2 ). to calculate t1/2 the formula 0.693/lambdaz
was used, where lambdaz was determined from the slope of the
regression analysis of logarithmic concentration versus time
data. auc from time zero to the last measurable sampling
time point (auc0–t ) and auc from time zero to time infinity (auc0–∞ ) were calculated by trapezoidal summation
(winnonlin professional, version 3.1, pharsight corporation, mountain view, ca, usa). plasma concentrations below the loq were set to zero.

183

2.6. study drug
 xxxd2517xxx  tablets (200 mg each) were supplied by novartis pharmaceuticals. the single 400 mg oral dose of  xxxd2517xxx  was chosen because it is the highest daily dose
anticipated for clinical use.
2.7. statistical analyses
the sample size of eight subjects with moderate hepatic
impairment and eight matched healthy subjects was chosen
on the basis of industry guidance from the us food and drug
administration on pk studies in this population [21]. arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated for
auc, cmax , and t1/2 , while the median with range was determined for tmax . analysis of variance (anova) was performed on log-transformed data using a matched-pair design
model with group (hepatically impaired or healthy control)
and block (matched pairs) as factors, and ratios (with 90%
confidence intervals) between the two groups of geometric
means for  xxxd2517xxx  pk parameters (auc0–t , auc0–∞ ,
cmax ) were determined using this model.
ex vivo protein binding was compared in the two groups
using one way anova. a p value ≤0.05 was considered
statistically significant for all comparisons. possible relationships between pk parameters and indices of hepatic function
at screening (prothrombin time, serum bilirubin, and serum
albumin) were explored using pearson’s correlation.

3. results
3.1. subjects

venous blood samples for assessing plasma protein binding ex vivo were taken pre dose and at 2 and 12 h post
dose. plasma was prepared as described above, adjusted to
ph 7.4 with 1 n hcl and spiked with 50 ng ml−1 [3 h] xxxd2517xxx  (specific activity: 1 mci mg−1 ). the fraction
of  xxxd2517xxx  bound to plasma proteins was determined
by measuring radioactivity in plasma and in ultrafiltrates
obtained by micropartition centrifugation using centrifuge
tubes with a molecular weight cut-off of 30,000 da (centrifree micropartition centrifuge tube, amicon, beverly,
ma, usa) and centrifugation for 15 min at 1500 × g.

a total of 16 subjects entered and completed the study.
eight subjects had a moderate degree of hepatic impairment, having a child–pugh score of 7 and 8 and a confirmed diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, in four cases by a liver
biopsy. all eight patients with hepatic impairment received
concomitant medication to treat hepatic insufficiency during
the study. this included spironolactone and furosemide to
treat oedema or ascites in six patients, lactulose for the reduction of encephalopathy in one patient, and multivitamins
in four patients. matched healthy subjects had unremarkable medical histories, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, clinical chemistries, haematologies, and urinalyses.
demographic and background characteristics for the two
groups are provided in table 1.

2.5. safety assessments

3.2. pharmacokinetics

safety and tolerability of the study drugs and procedures were monitored by means of complete physical examinations, measurement of vital signs, serum and urine
chemistry, haematology, and recording of aes, concomitant
medications, and ecgs.

following the administration of a single 400 mg oral dose
of  xxxd2517xxx , plasma  xxxd2517xxx  concentration–time profiles were similar over 96 h in the healthy subjects and the
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (fig. 1). in both
groups  xxxd2517xxx  concentrations were below the loq af-

ter 24 h post dose. the pk parameters are listed in table 2.
auc values were comparable between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (auc0–∞ =
29.2±6.7 ␮g h ml−1 versus 28.7±6.3 ␮g h ml−1 ). the mean
cmax was lower in subjects with hepatic impairment (6.7 ±
2.1 ␮g ml−1 versus 7.5±1.4 ␮g ml−1 ) but the difference did
not reach statistical significance;  xxxd2517xxx  concentrations
reached a maximum at 2 h in both groups. the mean t1/2
for  xxxd2517xxx  was similar in subjects with hepatic impairment (3.8 ± 0.4 h) and healthy subjects (2.9 ± 1.3 h). ratios
(hepatically impaired subjects:healthy subjects) of geometric means (90% confidence intervals) for auc0–∞ , auc0–t
and cmax were 1.01 (0.86, 1.19), 1.01 (0.85, 1.19) and 0.86
(0.65, 1.15), respectively.

relationships between  xxxd2517xxx  auc or cmax and
the three laboratory parameters that are components of the
child–pugh score were explored (serum bilirubin concentration, albumin concentration and prothrombin time; table 1).
bilirubin ranged from 0.4 to 2.4 mg dl−1 in the hepatically
impaired subjects compared with 0.3–1.0 mg dl−1 in the
matched healthy subjects, albumin concentrations ranged
from 3.5 to 4.4 g dl−1 in the hepatically impaired subjects
compared with 4.1–4.7 g dl−1 in the matched healthy subjects, and prothrombin time ranged from 10.0 to 21.0 s in
the hepatically impaired subjects compared with 9.0–10.0 s
in the matched healthy subjects. there was no evidence
for correlation between these laboratory parameters and
 xxxd2517xxx  auc or cmax .
no difference was found in the binding of  xxxd2517xxx  to
plasma proteins in hepatically impaired subjects compared
with healthy subjects. the mean bound fractions of [3 h] xxxd2517xxx  in healthy subjects and in those with hepatic
impairment determined in plasma collected pre dose and at
2 and 12 h post dose, were between 0.984 and 0.985.
3.3. safety
no serious aes or premature discontinuations occurred
during the study. only 4 of 16 subjects reported aes, two
in each group. the reported events included constipation,
headache, somnolence, and difficulty urinating. all aes
were mild in severity and resolved without further action. no

4. discussion
the aim of this study was to compare the pk profile of a
single 400 mg dose of  xxxd2517xxx  in subjects with moderate
hepatic impairment with that in demographically matched
healthy subjects. the results indicate that no significant differences occurred between these two groups in cmax , tmax
or auc. bergquist et al. have recently drawn attention to
the use of clinical laboratory components of the child–pugh
score as potential covariates to help guide dosing in hepatically impaired patients [23]. this approach was applied to
 xxxd2517xxx  auc and cmax but did not reveal any positive
correlation with bilirubin level or prothrombin time, or any
negative correlation with albumin level. these results suggest that while liver metabolism of  xxxd2517xxx  by cyp2c9
plays a central role in the clearance of the drug from human
plasma, moderate liver impairment does not significantly alter plasma  xxxd2517xxx  pk. the lack of difference in  xxxd2517xxx  plasma protein binding between healthy subjects and
those with moderate hepatic insufficiency also indicates that
moderate hepatic insufficiency does not alter the handling
of  xxxd2517xxx .
the effects of liver disease on the pk of xenobiotics are
highly variable and difficult to predict [20]. drug metabolism
in hepatically impaired subjects appears to be differentially
influenced by the extent and type of hepatic injury (e.g. alterations in blood flow, reduction in protein synthesis, decrease
in hepatocyte number), the type of drug being investigated,
and changes in the metabolic capacity of residual hepatocytes. in vivo studies suggest that, while cytochrome p-450
mediated hepatic drug metabolism may be impaired in subjects with severe liver disease because of reduced liver enzyme levels, the cyp proteins may be differentially altered
by hepatic impairment, particularly in individuals with liver
cirrhosis [24]. the catalytic activities of four xenobioticmetabolising cyp isoenzymes ( xxxg590xxx ,  xxxg589xxx , cyp2c,
and cyp1a2) and the liver content of these isoenzymes
have been shown to differ with the type of liver disease.
in particular, cyp2c content is reduced only in livers from
patients with severe chronic cholestasis [24].  xxxd2517xxx 
is metabolised in humans by cyp2c9, and it is possible
that the level of severe chronic cholestasis in subjects in this
study (with moderate hepatic impairment) was not sufficient
to alter  xxxd2517xxx  metabolism.
in conclusion, this study found that the pk and tolerability
profiles of a single 400 mg dose of  xxxd2517xxx  did not alter
in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. prior studies
have indicated that multiple-dose  xxxd2517xxx  pharmacokinetics are accurately predicted by single-dose data. indeed,
upon repeat daily dosing, and in a dose range including the
400 mg od dose level,  xxxd2517xxx  has demonstrated linear
and time-independent pharmacokinetics with no accumula-

185

tion [14,25–27]. these data, and the fact that in this study
plasma  xxxd2517xxx  levels fell below the loq by 24 h post
400 mg dose (the highest daily dose anticipated for clinical
use), indicate that no dose adjustment is necessary when  xxxd2517xxx  is administered to subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. the pk profile of  xxxd2517xxx  has
not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment,
hence, use in this group is not recommended.
