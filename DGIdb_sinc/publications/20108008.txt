abstract incorporation of l- or d-tic into position 7 of
oxytocin (ot) and its deamino analogue ([mpa1]ot)
resulted in four analogues, [l-tic7]ot (1), [d-tic7]ot (2),
[mpa1,l-tic7]ot (3) and [mpa1,d-tic7]ot (4). their biological properties were described by fragiadaki et al. (eur j
med chem 42:799–806, 2007). their nmr study (noesy, tocsy, 1h–13c hsqc spectra) is presented here.
analogues 1, 3 and 4 showed partial agonistic activity,
analogue 2 was pure antagonist, suggesting that a cis
conformation between residues 6 and 7 of the molecule
does not result in antagonistic activity. however, the
reduction in agonistic activity of analogues 1, 3 and 4 in
comparison to oxytocin is consistent with the reduction of
the trans conformation form. binding affinity for the

and 380 nm for peptides 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively,
showed lower affinity in the case of d analogues. deamination slightly increased the affinity. the existence of both
cis and trans configurations of the cys6-d-tic7 bond is
supported by observation of two sets of cross-peaks for 1h
and 13c nuclei for most of the residues of the peptide not
only in noesy and tocsy but also in 1h–13c hsqc
spectra. the ms and hplc indicate the presence of a
single molecule/peptide, and nmr data thus suggest that
this second set of peaks is due to the cis conformation.

introduction
the neurohypophyseal peptide hormone oxytocin (ot) is a
cyclic nonapeptide with a disulfide linkage between two
cysteine residues at positions 1 and 6. the n-terminal
amino group is free, the c-terminus tail with the sequence
pro-leu-gly is amidated. its highly potent deamino analogue (dot) differs only in the absence of the n-terminal
amino group. among other methods, nmr was frequently
used for the study of conformation of ot, dot, vasopressin and several of their analogues (hruby and lebl
1987; lebl et al. 1990; marik et al. 2001; budesinsky et al.
2005; budesı́nsky et al. 2005; sikorska et al. 2006;
rodziewicz-motowidlo et al. 2008; li et al. 2008; zhou
and troy 2005; zhou and troy 2003).
first results of 1h- and 13c-nmr experiments with ot
and  xxxd3495xxx  (avp) led to the consideration
that the cys6-pro7 bond of ot and avp exists exclusively
in the trans conformation (hruby and lebl 1987). later,
10% cis isomer population in water was detected when
studying the amide isomer equilibrium of the cys6-pro7
bond in ot by one- and two-dimensional nmr spectroscopy (larive et al. 1992). the relative quantity of the cis
isomer was decreased when the solvent was changed from
water to methanol (larive and rabenstein 1993) which
agreed with the expectation that the rate of cis/trans
interconversion may be faster in non-aqueous solvents
(harrison and stein 1992). cis peptide bonds were latter
also observed in sarcosyl7-, n-methylalanyl7-, thiazolidine4-carboxylic acid7 or 3,4-didehydroproline7-ot analogues
(grzonka et al. 1985; grzonka et al. 1983; rodziewiczmotowidlo et al. 2002; rosamond and ferger 1976; moore
et al. 1977). introduction of glycine into position 7 leads to
a decrease of uterotonic activity though to an increase of
selectivity (hruby and lebl 1987; lowbridge et al. 1977).
all the results indicate that proline in position 7 is an
important conformational constraint necessary for biological activity.
structure–activity studies concerning the structural features leading to agonism or antagonism of oxytocin effect
on uterus prompted investigations on the hypothesis that
antagonism is due to the cis cys6-pro7 isomer, whereas the
trans isomer results in agonistic activity. for example, the
cis cys-pro peptide bond was observed in the potent
bicyclic antagonists of ot, [mpa1,cyclo(glu4,lys8)]ot
and [dpen1,cyclo(glu4,lys8)]ot, by nmr spectroscopy
and computational analysis (shenderovich et al. 1997). the
x-ray structure of the potent ot agonist, [mpa1]ot (dot),
showed the cys-pro imide bond in the trans conformation
(wood et al. 1986). these observations led lubell and
others to synthesize analogues of ot, [mpa1]ot, and
[dpen1]ot having replaced pro7 by (2s,5r)-5-tert-butylproline, a proline analogue inducing up to 90% of the cis

123

z. spyranti et al.

amide conformation in n-(acetyl)dipeptide-n0 -methylamides as shown previously (belec et al. 2000; bélec et al.
2001).
wittelsberger et al. (2005) on the other hand reported
the synthesis and the conformational and biological
properties of thiazolidine and oxazolidine derivatives in
position 7 that served as proline analogues with increased
proline-specific properties. the dimethyl-substituted
derivatives, 2,2-dimethyl- xxxd3355xxx 
and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-oxazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, induce
up to 95% of the cis conformation as determined by oneand two-dimensional nmr spectroscopy in dmso and in
water. the impact of the dimethyl moiety at 2-c was
assessed by comparison with the corresponding dihydro
compound, [cys(uh,hpro)]7ot. comparison of the oxytocic activities of the cis-constrained compounds and ot
showed that the agonistic potency increased proportionally
to the trans content of the 6-7 peptide bond; however, no
antagonistic activity was observed for the cis-constrained
analogue, weakening the possibility that the cis conformation is necessary for antagonism. the results lead
however to the hypothesis that the cis/trans conformational change is playing a role in  xxxg1642xxx  binding and
activation. there was one interesting finding and thus that
in the absence and presence of  xxxd2531xxx , a considerable change was observed in the pattern of the hr
protons of residues 3 and 1, indicating conformational
changes that influence activity (wittelsberger et al. 2005).
also in the case of cyclic analogues, the structural analysis
revealed b-turns around residues tyr2 and ile3, which
differed from the previously discussed b-turn geometry
around residues 3 and 4 that was ascribed to the conformation of ot agonists (hruby and lebl 1987; oldziej
et al. 1995).
recently we have published the synthesis and biological
activities of four new ot and dot analogues having
incorporated l- or d-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (l- or d-tic) into position 7 (fragiadaki et al.
2007), i.e., [l-tic7]ot (1), [d-tic7]ot (2), [mpa1,
7

l-tic ]ot (3) and [mpa ,d-tic ]ot (4). as their biological
activities have been very interesting (see table 1) we
decided to study their structure more deeply. the nmr
study (determination and analysis of noesy, tocsy, and
1
h–13c hsqc spectra) is presented in this paper.

noesy (marion and wüthrich 1983; jeener et al. 1979)
spectra were acquired using mixing time sm = 300 ms
applying water suppression during the relaxation delay and
mixing time. all 2d spectra were acquired with
10.014 ppm spectral width, consisting of 2 k data points in
the f2 dimension, 16–32 transients and 512–1,024 complex
increments in the f1 dimension. raw data were multiplied
in both dimensions by a pure cosine-squared bell window
function and fourier-transformed to obtain 2,048 9 2,048
real data points. a polynomial base-line correction was
applied in both directions. for data processing and spectral
analysis, the standard bruker software (xwinnmr 3.5)
and xeasy (eccles et al. 1991) program (eth, zurich)
were used.

structure calculations and refinement

noe constraints

tocsy maps were first analyzed to assign the individual
spin patterns of amino acids through scalar connectivities.
sequential, medium and long range connectivities were
identified from noesy maps acquired with sm = 300 ms.
chemical shifts for the four peptides are reported in
tables 2, 3, 4, and 5. characteristics tocsy fingerprints
regions are given in fig. 1.

313, 286, 225 and 440 noesy cross-peaks were assigned
in both dimensions for [d-tic7]ot, [mpa1,d-tic7]ot,
[mpa1,l-tic7]ot and [l-tic7]ot, respectively, in dmso.
the number of unique cross-peaks were 151, 136, 124
and 216 (15, 14, 13 and 22 constraints per residue for
[d-tic7]ot, [mpa1,d-tic7]ot, [mpa1,l-tic7]ot and
[l-tic7]ot, respectively). their intensities were converted
into upper limit distances through caliba (güntert et al.
1991). sequential constraints, number and range of noes
and chemical shift differences ({(ddha)2 ? (ddhm)2}1/2)
are illustrated in online resources 1, 2 and 3.

the noe-derived structural information extracted from the
analysis of noesy spectra acquired in dmso –d6 solutions under identical experimental conditions for all three
peptides was introduced to dyana (güntert et al. 1997;
wüthrich et al. 1983) software for structure calculations.
the peptide models in the figures have been generated with
molmol (pearlman et al. 1997). structural calculations
have been performed on ibm risc6000 and xw4100/
xw4200 hp linux workstations. 3j(nh–ha) coupling
constants were determined by inverse fourier transformation of in-phase multiplets from noesy spectra using the
infit routine of the xeasy software (eccles et al. 1991).

type connectivities are observed for the tripeptide comprised of tyr2-ile3-gln4, while hb–hn (i, i ? 2) type
noes are also identified among residues tyr2-ile3-gln4,

network in concern with hn-hn connectivity between

residues. additionally, two medium-range noes of hb
protons of mpa1 with ha and hb protons of cys6 indicate
that these residues of the peptide are in close proximity in a

formation of a hydrogen bond between residues ile3 and
asn5 is consistent in all 20 calculated models. schematic

chemical shift variation was observed for leu8
([0.50 ppm), while smaller variations were calculated for
ile3 and gly9 ([0.30 ppm) suggesting conformational
rearrangements between the two peptides (online resource
3). the chemical shift variation of ile3 is justified by the
noe network involving amino acids ile3and cys6, present
only in the [mpa1,d-tic7]ot peptide. as a conclusion, the
modification in position 7 suggests small conformational
rearrangements of the fragment leu8-glynh92 between the
two peptides.
as far as the [d-tic7]ot-[l-tic7]ot peptide pair is
concerned, the largest chemical shift variation was
observed for asn5 ([0.50 ppm), while smaller variations
were calculated for tyr2 and leu8 ([0.30 ppm) suggesting
conformational rearrangements between the two peptides.
the chemical shift variations of asn5 and tyr2 are justified
by the noe network involving amino acids cys1-asn5 in
the [d-tic7]ot peptide, and by noes between tyr2-l-tic7,
present only in the [l-tic7]ot peptide. the chemical shift
variation calculated for leu8 ([0.30 ppm) is justified by
the modification of the amino acid in position 7.
structure calculations and conformational analysis

chemical shift difference analysis
two diagrams illustrating the 1h chemical shift differences
between the peptide pairs were plotted. the variations in
chemical shifts are potential indicators for the conformational changes imposed by the replacement of the amino
acids at position 7 (online resource 3). these plots refer to
the peptide pairs [d-tic7]ot-[mpa1,d-tic7]ot and
[l-tic7]ot-[mpa1,l-tic7]ot. the largest chemical shift
variation in the first peptide pair [d-tic7]ot-[mpa1,
7
6
d-tic ]ot (black) was observed for cys ([0.40 ppm),
while smaller variations were calculated for asn5 and leu8,
suggesting conformational rearrangements between the two
peptides. the introduction of mpa1 in position 1, which is a
non-protein residue and is less bulky than cys1, has been
shown to affect the chemical environment and consequently
the nature of the disulfide bond linking positions 1 and 6.
furthermore, asn5, which lies in the middle of the sequence,
seems to be affected by modification in position 1.
in the other peptide pair [l-tic7]ot-[mpa1,l-tic7]ot
the largest chemical shift variations are calculated for tyr2
and cys6 ([0.60 ppm) affected by modification in position
1. a smaller variation is observed for gly9 ([0.50 ppm),
suggesting a different conformation for the tripeptide segment pro7-leu8-glynh92.
another two diagrams illustrating the 1h chemical shift

the average target function for the dyana family of 20
calculated models was found to be 0.32 ± 1.34 9 10-5 å2
for [d-tic7]ot, 0.11 ± 0.003 å2 for [mpa1,d-tic7]ot,
0.66 ± 1.06 9 10-7 å2 for [mpa1,l-tic7]ot and 0.45 ±
0.23 å2 for [l-tic7]ot peptide models. no consistent
violations existed at the final dyana run and no constrained violation was found larger than 0.30 å.
the dyana family models for [d-tic7]ot peptide
exhibit pairwise rmsd values for all residues 0.10 ± 0.05 å
(bb), 1.26 ± 0.48 å (ha) for the 20 structures. the rmsd
values for [mpa1,d-tic7]ot ensemble are 0.36 ± 0.43 å
(bb), 0.99 ± 0.61 å (ha) for the 20 models, while for
[mpa1,l-tic7]ot are found 1.00 ± 0.44 å (bb),
2.50 ± 0.73 å (ha) for the 20 models. furthermore, the
dyana family models for [l-tic7]ot peptide exhibit
rmsd values for all residues 0.69 ± 0.48 å (bb),
1.62 ± 0.52 å (ha) for the 20 structures.
3d solution structures
the nmr data for the four analogues indicate that the
residue in position 1 (cys1/mpa1) remains in close spatial
proximity with cys6. medium range noes between residues cys1/mpa1 and cys6 are fully consistent with the fact
that cys1/mpa1 and cys6 are linked through a disulfide
bond. in general, [d-tic7]ot, [mpa1,d-tic7]ot and
[mpa1,l-tic7]ot peptides exhibit a lower number of noe
cross-peaks (151, 136 and 124 cross-peaks, respectively)
relative to the [l-tic7]ot peptide (216 noe cross-peaks).

in position 7 l- and d-tic-substituted oxytocin and deamino oxytocin

highly populated hydrogen bonds are identified through
the analysis of the nmr solution models ensemble. specifically, both analogues bearing ltic in position 7 of the
peptide sequence form a hydrogen bond involving amino
acids in positions 2 and 5. in the [ltic7]ot analogue, a
strong backbone hydrogen bond is identified between tyr2nh and the asn5-co (1.42–1.55 å). additionally, a
diagnostic tool for the determination of a turn structure is
the ca distance of the residues (lewis et al. 1973). to this
context, the ca atoms of tyr2 and asn5 are found in close
proximity (4.37–5.00 å). in the [mpa1,ltic7]ot analogue,
a high populated h-bond is formed between the amide
proton of asn5 and the carbonyl oxygen of tyr2 (1.57–
2.09 å), while the distance between the ca atoms of these
amino residues is measured 4.40–4.49 å. the above data
suggest regular b-turns for both [ltic7]ot and [mpa1,
ltic7]ot peptides comprised of tyr2-asn5 residues.
applying the same criteria as above, for the [mpa1,dtic7]ot analogue, the turn formed bears the conformational
features of a c-turn. a very highly populated hydrogen
bong, observed in 19 out of the 20 calculated structures of
the ensemble, is formed among residues asn5-nh and ile3co (1.87–2.32 å) in the [mpa1,dtic7]ot analogue. the
distance between the ca atoms of tyr2 and asn5 is found to
be 2.4–3.4 å. moreover, a second weaker h bond is
identified between hd protons of asn5 and the carbonyl
oxygen of gln4, present in 10 out of 20 calculated structures. concerning the [dtic7]ot peptide, no highly populated hydrogen bonding is identified and no safe
conclusion can be extracted from the analysis of the nmr

545

data and calculated models for the assignment of this turn
conformation to any of b- or c-turns.
in the [l-tic7]ot analogue, residues cys1 and cys6 are
also found to be in close proximity as manifested by
medium-range noes, such as the hb proton of cys1 with
the amide proton of cys6, as well as the amide proton of
tyr2 with the amide proton of asn5 and cys6. the observed
noes are indicative for a local conformation that favours
the formation of a hydrogen bond between tyr2 and asn5
observed in the family of 20 best dyana structures, while
a turn is formed by residues ile3-gln4-asn5. furthermore,
the ha–hm of (i, i ? 2) and hb–hn of (i, i ? 2) type
noe connectivities for residues tyr2 and gln4 indicate the
formation of a type ii-b turn for this segment. moreover, (i,
i ? 3) type connectivities between tyr2 and asn5 further
support the backbone turn for this region (fig. 2).
according to the nmr analysis and structure calculations presented here, [l-tic7]ot shares some similar conformational features with [mpa1,l-tic7]ot. residues mpa1
and cys6 are also found in spatial proximity. the vicinity
of these residues is supported by a significantly smaller
amount of noes than in the case of the [l-tic7]ot peptide,
which leads to a less compact structure (fig. 3).
a backbone turn involving residues ile3-gln4-asn5 is
observed in the [mpa1,l-tic7]ot peptide, supported by (i,
i ? 2) type connectivities between residues ile3-asn5,
similar to the [l-tic7]ot analogue. in contrast, their side
chains are oriented to opposite directions, possibly due to
the observed noes between amino acids cys6-leu8,
present only in the [mpa1,l-tic7]ot peptide (fig. 3).

the nmr data for [d-tic7]ot and [mpa1,d-tic7]ot
peptides indicate that residues in positions 1 and 7 are in
close spatial proximity (fig. 3). medium-range noes
between cys1 and asn5 present in the [d-tic7]ot peptide
and noes between mpa1 and cys6 in the [mpa1,d-tic7]ot
peptide support the vicinity of these peptide residues. the
formation of a hydrogen bond between ile3-asn5 observed
in all 20 calculated models of [mpa1,d-tic7]ot peptide
further supports this finding. the overall conformation of
the backbone for the segment cys1/mpa1-cys6 reveals
great structural similarities between the two analogues, but
also some differences. noe (i, i ? 2) connectivities
between cys1 and ile3 indicate the formation of a backbone
bend for this segment in the [d-tic7]ot peptide. on the
other hand, noe interactions between (1) hb protons of
tyr2 with the amide proton of gln4 and (2) the amide
proton of ile3 with the amide proton of asn5 and cys6 lead
the [mpa1,d-tic7]ot peptide to adopt a turn-like structure
comprised of these residues.
as far as the fragment of cys6-d-tic7-leu8-gly9nh2 is
concerned; both ot peptides exhibit a backbone turn due
to the (i, i ? 2) type connectivities of hb proton of cys6
with the amide proton of leu8, observed in both peptides.
however, noe connectivities of hb proton of cys6 with
the hb and the side chain protons of leu8, present only in
the [d-tic7]ot peptide, lead the two amino residues to
adopt a parallel orientation in space with the side chain
protons of leu8 lying in the same region in space with hb
protons of cys6. the segment comprised of leu8-gly9nh2
exhibits a rather extended backbone conformation for both
[d-tic7]ot and [mpa1,d-tic7]ot peptides.
as a conclusion, deamination in position 1 influences
the conformational flexibility of cys1/mpa1–cys6, which in
turn affects the geometry of the disulfide bond and imposes
a conformational difference among the peptides. on the
other hand, the change of configuration of amino acid in
position 7 (replacement of l-tic7 by d-tic7) is inducing
smaller conformational changes in the backbone of the ot

123

z. spyranti et al.

peptides in the case of deamino analogues than the amino
analogues (fig. 3). the n-terminal 7-residue fragment of
the [mpa1,l-tic7]ot and [mpa1,d-tic7]ot peptides adopts
the very same backbone conformation (fig. 3). the backbone structure of the 3-residue fragment of the c-terminus
is also similar among the peptides with the different orientation, resulting from replacement of l-tic7 by d-tic7,
being the main difference among the [mpa1,l-tic7]ot and
[mpa1,d-tic7]ot peptides. finally, it is worth noting that
the distribution of the amino acids in the tertiary structures
leads the peptides to form a polar face and a more polar
side. tyr2, gln4 and asn5 lead the peptide to adopt a solvent exposed polar face, while the hydrophobic aminoacids
tic7 and leu8 form the c-terminal tripetide.

discussion
literature data indicate that the neurohypophyseal hormone analogues lacking the n-terminal amino group are
inactivated slower than the mother compounds and have
enhanced biological activities both agonistic and antagonistic ones (oldziej et al. 1995; fragiadaki et al. 2007). the
anti-oxytocic activity was significantly enhanced in the
case of both analogues [mpa1,l-tic7]ot and [mpa1,dtic7]ot, while the agonistic activity was only slightly
affected (bélec et al. 2001). furthermore, the first amino
acid seems to play a decisive role in receptor binding
(oldziej et al. 1995; fragiadaki et al. 2007). in our case,
deamination slightly increased the affinity of the analogues
to human  xxxg1642xxx . it has been known that the
proper orientation and the sequence of the c-terminal tripeptide are critical for obtaining high-potency ot analogues (wittelsberger et al. 2005; oldziej et al. 1995;
fragiadaki et al. 2007; flouret et al. 2006). moreover, the
side chains of ile3 and pro7 are involved in the recognition
and binding of the hormone by the uterine receptor
(wittelsberger et al. 2005; oldziej et al. 1995; fragiadaki
et al. 2007; braunschweiler and ernst 1983). therefore,
structural modifications of the side chains in the c-terminal
tripeptide might lead to analogues with variable biological
properties at different ot issues. the great decrease in the
agonistic potency of [l-tic7]ot analogue as compared to
the native hormone suggests that modification at position 7
by conformational restricted and bulky residue, such as
l-tic, induces such conformational changes in the peptide
backbone that cause markedly different distribution of the
elements necessary for the binding of agonists and intrinsic
activity.
according to our structural analysis, the replacement of
amino acid l-tic7 by the more stereo-chemically constrained d-tic7 seems to induce minor conformational
changes in the backbone conformation, with the main

in position 7 l- and d-tic-substituted oxytocin and deamino oxytocin

difference being the altered side chain orientation of the
c-terminal 3-residue fragment of the peptides. the presence of the d-tic aminoacid in position 7 results in a more
compact structure by limiting the local conformational
flexibility, inducing a bend in the backbone conformation.
this structural difference is reflected in the biological
properties, with the d-counterpart being a pure antagonist
with higher antagonistic potency than the l-counterpart.
this finding is also confirmed in the [mpa1,l-tic7]ot[mpa1,d-tic7]ot peptide pair, with the anti-oxytocin
activity being significantly enhanced in the [mpa1,
7
d-tic ]ot peptide. it is worth noting that the main conformational difference resulting from the substitution of
7
7
l-tic with d-tic in this peptide pair is observed for the
backbone conformation of the leu8-gly9 nh2 fragment.
the studied analogues are also exhibiting remarkable
conformational properties from the point of view of the cis/
trans isomerization of the cys6-tic7 peptide bond. the
orientation of this bond and its relationship to agonism and
antagonism has been previously studied; however, no
direct relationship was found (shenderovich et al. 1997;

547

wood et al. 1986). the introduction of the non-proteinogenic and less bulky mpa residue in position 1 is not
affecting the nature of the disulfide bond linking residues in
positions 1 and 6 in oxytocin. on the contrary, the introduction of the d-tic isomer into position 7, when position 1
is occupied by cys, alters the geometry of the sc and
neighboring atoms of the s–s bond (fig. 4). the rearrangement of the c-terminal 3-residue fragment can be
focused on the variation of the geometry of the cys6-tic7
peptide bond. in both [d-tic7]ot and [mpa1,d-tic7]ot
analogues, a second set of peaks for most residues of the
peptide sequence has been observed in all spectra used
(noesy, tocsy and 13c-hsqc). the population of
these species is ranging between 25 and 30%, suggesting
the presence of cis-isomerization in the peptide bond
between positions 6 and 7. on the other hand, in both cases
where l-tic occupies position 7 in the peptide sequence,
a unique set of peaks is observed, suggesting that cys67
l-tic
bond is found in trans conformation and no
cis-isomers are present.
according to our structural investigation of the four ot
analogues and bearing in mind that d-counterparts showed
higher inhibitory potency than the l-counterparts, the
reduction in agonistic activity is fully consistent with the
reduction of the trans conformation form of cys6-tic7
peptide bond.
