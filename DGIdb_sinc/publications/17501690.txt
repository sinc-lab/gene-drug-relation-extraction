aripiprazole has made a significant contribution to the treatment of
schizophrenia and related disorders with an improved safety and tolerability
profile, which has been attributed to its unique pharmacological profile. it
has been claimed that partial agonism of the dopamine d2 and 5-ht1a receptors and antagonism of the  xxxg1113xxx  contribute to the clinical profile of
aripiprazole, a so-called dopamine- and 5-ht stabiliser. however, recent
studies have questioned the role of the 5-ht-mediated systems in the
mechanism of action of aripiprazole. this report reviews published and
unpublished data that suggest that aripiprazole acts as a selective partial
agonist at the  xxxg656xxx  and does not affect 5-ht receptors at
therapeutic doses.

unique profile of aripiprazole

unlike typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, which act as antagonists at the
 xxxg656xxx , aripiprazole has a novel mechanism of action, acting as a partial agonist at the  xxxg656xxx  [1-3]. this novel mechanism is claimed to
result in a unique clinical profile associated with efficacy against schizophrenia and
with an improved tolerability (low extrapryamidal side-effect liability, low propensity to induce weight gain and no prolactinaemia). recently, it has been suggested that aripiprazole has other pharmacological properties that may contribute to
its clinical profile. thus aripiprazole displays antagonist activity at the 5-ht2a
receptor [2] and partial agonist activity at the  xxxg1108xxx  [2,4].
this paper examines evidence that suggest that an action at 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a
receptors is unlikely to contribute to the antipsychotic profile of aripiprazole at
pharmacologically relevant doses.

profile of aripiprazole

aripiprazole has high affinity (pki) for the  xxxg656xxx  (9.2 ± 0.1), a lower
affinity for 5-ht2a (8.1 ± 0.1) and dopamine d3 (8.0 ± 0.2) receptors and an even
lower affinity for 5-ht2c (6.9 ± 0.1) and 5-ht1a (7.1 ± 0.1) receptors. this is confirmed in literature studies [2,5], suggesting the profile of aripiprazole is that it has
highest affinity (pki ≥ 9) for human 5-ht2b (h5-ht2b), hd2 and hd3 receptors, but
also has significant affinity (pki < 9 but > 7) for h5-ht1a, h5-ht2a, h5-ht1d,
halpha1a-adrenergic and histamine  xxxg2028xxx  receptors, and has a lower affinity for h5-ht2c
and other receptors [2]. although aripiprazole was developed as a partial agonist at the
 xxxg656xxx , in vitro functional studies have shown aripiprazole to have
other activities, including inverse agonism at 5-ht2b receptors and a partial agonism
at d3, 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c [2] and 5-ht1a receptors [2,4]. although aripiprazole may
exhibit these activities, these functional studies confirm the low potency of

aripiprazole acts as a selective  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist

aripiprazole at the 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors
compared with its extremely potent activity as a partial agonist
at the  xxxg656xxx .
aripiprazole differs from atypical antipsychotic drugs in
that it displays high affinity for the  xxxg656xxx  and
a lower affinity for the 5-ht1a and 5-ht2 receptors, and that
aripiprazole is a partial agonist at the  xxxg656xxx .
the unique in vitro profile of aripiprazole translates to a
unique in vivo profile, which predicts clinical efficacy with a
favourable side-effect profile (figure 1) [6,7]. the profile of
aripiprazole in comparison with other antipsychotic drugs is
shown in table 1. thus aripiprazole potently inhibits  xxxd163xxx -induced increases in locomotor activity (a dopamine
 xxxg656xxx -driven pharmacodynamic model), does not
induce cataleptic behaviour (a predictor for extrapyramidal
side-effect liability [8,9]) and does not elevate plasma prolactin
levels (a predictor for hyperprolactinaemia) in rats. in contrast, haloperidol affects all three behaviours at similar doses.
clozapine blocks  xxxd163xxx -induced motor behaviour at
similar doses at which it induces cataleptic-like behaviour, but
has no effects at the level of prolactin in the plasma. this is
consistent with the mild and transient elevations in prolactin
that are seen with clozapine in the clinic [10]. however, olanzapine is a potent blocker of  xxxd163xxx -induced locomotor
activity and increased plasma prolactin levels at similar doses,
but lacked significant induction of cataleptic behaviour.
aripiprazole displays potent antagonism of  xxxd163xxx -induced locomotor activity, but (unlike other atypical
antipsychotic drugs) does not induce catalepsy or elevate
plasma prolactin levels.
treatment of schizophrenic patients with dopamine d2
receptor antagonists is associated with the development of
extrapyramidal side effects, which develop early in treatment.
this is due to blockade of the nigrostriatal dopamine function, which arises from a reduction in the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurones in the substantia nigra pars
compacta as a result of chronic  xxxg656xxx  blockade. the
blockade of 5-ht2 receptors by atypical antipsychotic drugs is
thought to diminish the emergence of extrapyramidal side
effects through an interaction on dopamine release in the
striatum [11]. using selective 5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonists, antagonism of the  xxxg1115xxx  was shown to
be the probable mechanism by which atypical antipsychotic
drugs lack extrapyramidal side effects [8,12].
the low affinity of aripiprazole for the  xxxg1115xxx 
compared with its high affinity for the  xxxg656xxx 
suggests that it is unlikely that the low propensity of aripiprazole to induce catalepsy is mediated through an antagonist
action at the  xxxg1115xxx .
activity of atypical antipsychotic drugs at either 5-ht2a or
5-ht1a receptors has been suggested to be important in the
mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs [11].
following in vivo subcutaneous administration, aripiprazole
predominantly occupies dopamine d2 receptors in the rat
brain (ed50: 0.44 mg/kg) and only occupies other receptors
772

at doses that are 10- to 20-times higher than those that
occupy the  xxxg656xxx  (ed50 of d3 = 4.3 mg/kg; ed50 of
5-ht1a = 7.2 mg/kg; ed50 of 5-ht2a = 8.8 mg/kg; ed50 of
5-ht2c = 8.6 mg/kg) [13].
receptor occupancy does not provide a measure of receptor
activity. in this respect, it should be noted that the agonist
actions of aripiprazole at the  xxxg656xxx  in the mouse are
observed at higher doses (ed50: 2.8 mg/kg s.c. in the
gamma-butyrolactone model) than those that block postsynaptic d2
receptors (ed50: 0.2 mg/kg s.c. in apomorphine-induced
stereotypy model) [1]. these results are consistent with a low
intrinsic activity of aripiprazole at dopamine d2 receptors and
suggest that it acts predominantly as an antagonist at
post-synaptic d2 receptors and as a partial agonist at
presynaptic d2 receptors.
in vivo, aripiprazole lacked activity at the  xxxg1108xxx .
thus aripiprazole did not induce 5-ht1a-like behavioural
effects in rats using the flat body posture/lower lip retraction
model and it did not block these behaviours induced by
8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino-tetralin (8-oh-dpat) [14].
the ability of aripiprazole to antagonise the  xxxg1113xxx 
was compared with its ability to block the dopamine d2
receptor [1,6]. aripiprazole inhibited  xxxg1113xxx -mediated responses at higher doses (ed50: 7 mg/kg) than it
inhibited  xxxg656xxx -mediated responses
(ed50: 0.2 mg/kg). this generates a d2: xxxg1113xxx 
antagonism ratio for aripiprazole of 0.03, compared with 40
for risperidone (i.e., risperidone blocks  xxxg1113xxx -mediated responses more potently than it blocks
 xxxg656xxx -mediated responses) and 0.03 for
haloperidol. these values are in good agreement with the
occupancy data, suggesting a 20-fold separation between the
d2- and  xxxg1113xxx -mediated effects of aripiprazole.
these findings show that aripiprazole displays low levels of
5-ht1a and  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy and activity at
biologically relevant doses.

expert opinion

aripiprazole represents an important addition to the range of
treatments for psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. its
main benefit over existing drugs is its improved safety and
tolerability profile. it has an extremely low propensity to
increase prolactin, is weight neutral with minimal metabolic
side effects and it has a low risk for induction of extrapyramidal side effects. much of this improved side-effect
profile can be attributed to its novel profile, namely partial
agonism at the  xxxg656xxx  [7]. indeed, many of the
reported side effects of aripiprazole may also be attributed to
this activity, including nausea, somnolence and akathisia.
these effects usually resolve within 1 week of treatment [7],
consistent with the development of tolerance to agonist-like
effects. the lack of extrapyramidal side effects has been
attributed to the partial agonist actions of aripiprazole at the
 xxxg1108xxx  and antagonist actions at the 5-ht2a

receptor [6,11,15]. although aripiprazole clearly possesses these
actions, care must be taken in predicting in vivo activity from
studies on recombinant cell lines. this paper demonstrates
that aripiprazole displays low levels of occupancy of these
receptors in vivo and low levels of activity at these receptors.
therefore, it seems that aripiprazole behaves as a selective
 xxxg656xxx  partial agonist at least at biologically
relevant and (by inference) at therapeutically relevant doses. it
has been suggested that the profile of aripiprazole may be due
to functional selectivity rather than activity as a partial
agonist [2,16]. the phenomenon of functional selectivity suggests that a ligand acting at a single g-protein-coupled receptor causes dissimilar degrees of activation of different effector
pathways. thus aripiprazole acted as a potent partial agonist at
 xxxg656xxx -mediated signalling responses on
potentiation of  xxxd208xxx  release; as a weak partial agonist using mapk phosphorylation; and lacked agonist activity
on receptor internalisation [16]. the studies in this paper do

not distinguish between such mechanisms, namely functional
selectivity compared with partial agonism, but the results are
consistent with aripiprazole behaving as a low-efficacy partial
agonist at the  xxxg656xxx . it will be interesting to
see how other  xxxg656xxx  partial agonists (such as  xxxd336xxx )
compare to determine if functional selectivity contributes.
in conclusion, numerous mechanisms have been proposed
to underlie the unique clinical profile of aripiprazole, including 5-ht and dopamine stabilisation. this perspective paper
demonstrates that its unique profile can be attributed to it
being a selective, low intrinsic activity partial agonist at the
 xxxg656xxx .
