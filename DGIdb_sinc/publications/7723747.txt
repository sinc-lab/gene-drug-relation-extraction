modulation by mu-opioid agonists of guanosine-5'-o-(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate binding to membranes from human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells.  the ability of mu-opioid agonists to activate g proteins has been demonstrated by studying the binding of the gtp analogue guanosine-5'-o-(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate ([35s] xxxd553xxx ) to membranes from the human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cell line. the potent opioid agonist fentanyl caused an approximate doubling of basal [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding in a naloxone-sensitive manner, confirming this to be an opioid receptor-mediated process. the presence of gdp was necessary to observe this effect. pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, for 24 hr) completely prevented the fentanyl-stimulated increase in [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding and lowered the basal binding of [35s] xxxd553xxx . these latter data suggest an involvement of gi and/or go proteins and their activation by added membrane-bound receptors even in the absence of agonist. the order of potency of a series of opioid agonists in stimulating the binding of [35s] xxxd553xxx  was buprenorphine > cyclazocine =  xxxd2464xxx  > nalorphine > [d-ala2,mephe4,gly-ol5]enkephalin (damgo) > fentanyl > morphine > pentazocine. damgo, fentanyl, and morphine were full agonists but the remaining compounds showed decreasing levels of intrinsic activity in the order buprenorphine > pentazocine > cyclazocine = nalorphine >  xxxd2464xxx . the opioid antagonist naloxone was without effect. under the conditions of the [35s] xxxd553xxx  assay, binding of agonists was to a high affinity site, indicating that a high agonist affinity state of the mu-opioid receptor is responsible for the observed stimulation of [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding. the level of [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding (597 fmol/mg of protein) stimulated by damgo was 2-fold greater than the maximal number of mu-opioid agonist binding sites (bmax) determined using [3h]damgo (254 fmol/mg of protein). the opioid agonist-mediated stimulation of [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding in sh-sy5y cell membranes thus provides a "functional" measure of agonist occupation of mu-opioid receptors and offers a simple method for the determination of efficacy and intrinsic activity of mu-opioid agonists.
