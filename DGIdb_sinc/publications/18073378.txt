background

clinical trial data have shown that among breast cancer patients who were disease free after 5 years of
adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, further extended treatment with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor
letrozole reduces breast cancer recurrence. we examined the efficacy and tolerability of extended adjuvant therapy with another aromatase inhibitor,  xxxd173xxx , for 3 years among women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy.

methods

austrian breast and colorectal cancer study group (abcsg) trial 6a is an extension of abcsg trial 6, in
which  xxxg1603xxx –positive postmenopausal patients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, with
or without the aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx , for the first 2 years of therapy. for abcsg trial 6a,
patients who were disease free at the end of trial 6 were randomly assigned to receive either 3 years of
 xxxd173xxx  or no further treatment. efficacy data were analyzed with the use of a cox proportional
hazards regression model with two-sided p values and kaplan–meier curves, and tolerability data were
estimated using logistic regression analysis with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (cis).

results

abcsg trial 6a included 856 patients. at a median follow-up of 62.3 months, women who received  xxxd173xxx  (n = 387) had a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis) compared with women who received no further treatment
(n = 469; hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% ci = 0.40 to 0.96, p = .031).  xxxd173xxx  was well tolerated, and no unexpected adverse events were reported.

conclusions

these data confirm the benefit of extending adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years with  xxxd173xxx 
compared with no further treatment. further research is required to define the optimum length of extended
adjuvant therapy and to investigate the possibility of tailoring this period to suit different disease types.

five years of adjuvant tamoxifen has been the standard endocrine
treatment for early-stage breast cancer for several decades. adjuvant
endocrine therapy following primary surgery for breast cancer
reduces the risk of recurrence and increases overall survival beyond
the period of treatment for women with  xxxg730xxx  (er)–
positive disease (1). mature meta-analysis data on 15-year recurrence and breast cancer mortality probabilities demonstrate
substantial and persistent benefits of receiving adjuvant tamoxifen
compared with no adjuvant treatment (1). most of the effect of
adjuvant tamoxifen on recurrence is seen during the first 5 years
after surgery, when tamoxifen is generally still administered, with
gains in recurrence-free survival of 11.4%. however, many women
who are treated with 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen still develop
recurrent disease, and most of the effect of adjuvant tamoxifen on
breast cancer mortality occurs after the fifth year after surgery.

context and caveats
prior knowledge
a large clinical trial found that women who received 5 years of the
nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole after 5 years of adjuvant
tamoxifen experienced a 42% reduction in the risk of recurrence
compared with women who received placebo. however, early
stoppage of that trial precluded assessments of the long-term efficacy and safety of extended adjuvant treatment.

contribution
at a median follow-up of more than 5 years, extended adjuvant
therapy with 3 years of  xxxd173xxx  after successful completion of
5 years of tamoxifen reduced the risk of recurrence by 38% compared with no further treatment.  xxxd173xxx  was well tolerated,
and no unexpected adverse events were reported.
implications
the more manageable side effect profile of  xxxd173xxx  compared
with tamoxifen may allow the duration of adjuvant treatment to
extend beyond the 5-year period recommended for tamoxifen.
limitations
a prerandomization procedure was used to randomly assign all eligible patients in abcsg trial 6 (i.e., all those who remained in the
trial and disease free) to an arm of trial 6a to ensure that there
would be no gap in treatment between completion of 5 years of primary adjuvant therapy and commencement of the extended study.

the absolute survival benefit for women with er–positive disease
who received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen compared with women
who did not was almost three times greater at 15 years of follow-up
(9.2%) than at 5 years of follow-up (3.6%) (1,2).
a 5-year period for adjuvant monotherapy in postmenopausal
women was adopted because of the risk–beneﬁt proﬁle of tamoxifen,
rather than because an optimum length for adjuvant endocrine
therapy had been determined. current data indicate that approximately 10 years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment does not produce
additional overall survival beneﬁts compared with 5 years of treatment, partly because of the increased risk of thromboembolic disease
(1). in addition, the risk of endometrial cancer associated with
tamoxifen use increases with treatment duration (1,3,4). other
studies have also failed to demonstrate a reduced risk of recurrence
with more than 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (3,5,6). clinical trials
such as the adjuvant tamoxifen treatment—offer more? and
adjuvant tamoxifen longer against shorter trials are in progress
to more accurately deﬁne the advantages and disadvantages of
different lengths of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. however, in the
meantime, the 5-year period of treatment has become standard for
adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women, regardless of the
agent employed.

patients and methods
patients
abcsg trial 6a was a prospective randomized open-label clinical
study that was a continuation of abcsg trial 6, which compared 5
years of adjuvant tamoxifen (40 mg daily for the first 2 years, then 20 mg
daily thereafter) with 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (40 mg daily for
the first 2 years, then 20 mg daily thereafter) plus  xxxd147xxx 
(250 mg daily for week 1, 375 mg daily for week 2, then 500 mg daily
thereafter for the first 2 years of treatment) (13) (fig. 1).
patients who were eligible for abcsg trial 6 (and, therefore,
for abcsg trial 6a) were postmenopausal women in austria with
surgical treatment for histologically conﬁrmed, endocrine-responsive,
primary unilateral stage i or ii breast cancer (pt1 to pt3a) with
negative or positive axillary nodes. tumor stage was deﬁned using
the tnm (tumor–node–metastasis) classiﬁcation (14), and
postmenopausal status was deﬁned as amenorrhea for at least
1 year or gonadotrophin levels in the postmenopausal range (i.e.,
a  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  concentration of 2–105 pg/ml, a folliclestimulating hormone concentration of 2–151 pg/ml, and a  xxxd1903xxx  concentration of 2–210 pg/ml). surgical treatment
consisted of breast-conserving surgery, or modiﬁed radical mastectomy with obligatory negative margins plus complete axillary

study design
austrian breast and colorectal cancer study group (abcsg) trial
6a was a prospective randomized open-label clinical trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of extended adjuvant therapy with
 xxxd173xxx  for 3 years with no further treatment among patients
who were disease free at the end of abcsg trial 6, which found
that adjuvant tamoxifen plus the aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  was not superior to adjuvant tamoxifen alone in  xxxg1603xxx –positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

in recent years, aromatase inhibitors have become widely accepted
as alternatives to tamoxifen as the standard adjuvant treatment for
postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early-stage breast
cancer. five years of adjuvant treatment with the third-generation
nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor  xxxd173xxx  is superior to tamoxifen
treatment in postmenopausal women in terms of both efﬁcacy and
safety, as demonstrated by data from the  xxxd173xxx , tamoxifen,
alone or in combination (atac) trial at a median follow-up of
68 months (7). there are also efﬁcacy and safety beneﬁts associated
with switching to  xxxd173xxx  in patients who are disease free after
2–3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (8–11).
data from the national cancer institute of canada ma.17 trial
showed that breast cancer recurrence was statistically signiﬁcantly
(p<.001) reduced in patients who were disease free after 5 years of
adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen by further treatment with letrozole, another third-generation nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor
(12). although this was the ﬁrst trial to demonstrate the beneﬁt of
extending the period of adjuvant letrozole treatment beyond
5 years, it was halted early at a median follow-up of 30 months.
thus, no long-term efﬁcacy or safety data are available from this
randomized clinical investigation.
we sought to investigate the efﬁcacy of extended adjuvant
therapy with  xxxd173xxx  in breast cancer patients who remain
recurrence free after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. we conducted
a randomized trial (trial 6a) to compare extended adjuvant therapy
with  xxxd173xxx  for 3 years with no further treatment among
women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy in austrian
breast and colorectal cancer study group (abcsg) trial 6. we
examined recurrence-free and overall survival as well as tolerability. abcsg trial 6 had found that adjuvant tamoxifen plus the
aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  was not superior to adjuvant tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with primary,
 xxxg1603xxx –positive breast cancer (13).

procedures and assessments
computer-assisted prerandomization for abcsg trial 6a was
performed during trial 6 and centrally at the abcsg randomization office (vienna, austria) and confirmed by the individual trial
centers after patient’s informed consent was obtained during the
abcsg trial 6 completion visit. patients were allocated to receive
 xxxd173xxx  or no further treatment according to the minimization
method of pocock and simon (15), with stratification by the following prognostic factors: age, tumor size, tumor grade, number of
involved nodes, locoregional treatment, adjuvant therapy, hormone
receptor status, and participating trial center.
patients who were randomly assigned to receive no further
treatment underwent a physical examination, had laboratory serum
parameters and tumor markers assessed, and were monitored for
adverse events every 6 months for 5 years (i.e., up to the tenth year
jnci.oxfordjournals.org

after surgery). adverse events were deﬁned as any adverse change
in health or side effect that occurred while the patient was receiving treatment or within a prespeciﬁed period after treatment.
serious adverse events were deﬁned as any medical occurrence that
results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or clinically signiﬁcant disability or incapacity, or as a
congenital anomaly or birth defect in the children born to women
after they participated in this study.
patients who were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd173xxx 
underwent a physical examination and were monitored for adverse
events every 3 months during treatment (i.e., up to the eighth year
after surgery) and every 6 months during follow-up (i.e., up to the
tenth year after surgery). laboratory serum parameters and tumor
markers were assessed every 3 months during the ﬁrst year of treatment and every 6 months thereafter. chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound, mammography, and gynecologic examinations were
performed annually throughout follow-up for both groups.
the primary endpoint for abcsg trial 6a was recurrence-free
survival, which was deﬁned as the interval between the start of
 xxxd173xxx  treatment or of the observation period (for the no
further treatment group) and the ﬁrst evidence of locoregional
recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis.
locoregional recurrence was deﬁned as recurrence in the ipsilateral breast or chest wall or in the axillary nodes. distant metastases
included all distant lymph node recurrences (i.e., supraclavicular,
mammaria internal, and contralateral axilla) and organ metastases.
the secondary endpoints were overall survival, which was deﬁned
as the interval between the start of  xxxd173xxx  treatment or of the
observation period and death from any cause, and tolerability.
statistical analysis
all analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. the
effect of treatment on recurrence-free and overall survival was estimated using a univariate cox proportional hazards regression
model (16). a multivariable cox proportional hazards regression
model was also calculated by including all covariates that showed a
statistically significant effect in the corresponding univariate analysis at the 5% level. covariates that did not show a statistically significant effect in the univariate analysis were considered to be
irrelevant. multivariable hazard ratios (hrs) and corresponding
95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated. survival was analyzed by the kaplan–meier method using the log-rank test (17).
the proportionality assumption of the cox model was investigated
with a time-dependent exploratory variable, which was defined as
treatment multiplied by the logarithm (base e) of the time to event
(i.e., interaction term). a p value from the wald chi-squared statistic for this variable of less than 5% would have constituted evidence
of a departure from the proportionality assumption. there was no
evidence of departure from proportionality at the 5% statistical
significance level.
additional analyses included a multiple cox proportional hazards regression model that adjusted for the following factors used
in the randomization process: age, tumor size, tumor grade, number of involved nodes, locoregional treatment, adjuvant therapy,
and  xxxg1603xxx  status. interaction terms between treatment
and these factors were tested for statistical signiﬁcance.

clearance, including complete level i and ii dissection. patients
were required to have had histologic assessment of at least six axillary nodes. tumors were required to have er and/or progesterone
receptor levels of at least 10 fmol per milligram of cytosol protein
by biochemical determination or to be positive by immunohistochemical determination.
patients were ineligible for both abcsg trial 6 and abcsg
trial 6a if they displayed any evidence of metastatic disease (diagnosed according to local practice by x-ray of the chest wall, native
x-ray, computed tomography scan, ultrasound, or other methods)
or if they were premenopausal or had a previous diagnosis of
malignant disease (except cured squamous cell skin carcinoma
and early-stage cervical cancer). other exclusion criteria included
preoperative antineoplastic treatment and irradiation; negative or
unknown  xxxg1603xxx  status; general contraindications
including hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or  xxxd147xxx ;
more than 4 weeks between randomization and start of treatment
in abcsg trial 6a; in situ carcinoma with or without paget’s disease of the nipple; t4 tumor; inﬂammatory breast cancer; negative
or unknown receptor status; deﬁcient patient comprehension and/
or reliability; inadequate laboratory parameters; serious concomitant disease rendering treatment impossible as per protocol; age
greater than 80 years; karnofsky index greater than 3; septic complications; systemic infections; bilateral ovariectomy; or radiotherapy to ovaries.
adjuvant treatment in abcsg trial 6 was initiated within
6 weeks after surgery and lasted for 5 years or until disease recurrence or progression. all patients in abcsg trial 6 who had not
experienced a recurrence by the end of 5 years of adjuvant therapy
were eligible to participate in abcsg trial 6a and were randomly
reassigned to receive  xxxd173xxx  (1 mg daily) or no treatment for
3 years, beginning within 6 weeks after completing 5 years of
tamoxifen (fig. 1). we chose a 3-year duration for  xxxd173xxx 
treatment on the basis of ﬁnancial considerations and on our belief
that 3 years of  xxxd173xxx  should be sufﬁcient to achieve optimal
reduction of circulating estrogen levels.
all patients provided written informed consent, and the study
was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki.
abcsg trials 6 and 6a were approved by the relevant ethics
committees in austria. abcsg trial 6a was registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov with number nct00300508.

cancer study group (abcsg) trials 6 and 6a.

the main analysis of recurrence-free survival included the ﬁrst
occurrence of locoregional cancer, contralateral breast cancer, or
distant metastasis as recurrence. in a sensitivity analysis, however,
patients who did not experience recurrence were censored at the
last follow-up or at the date of diagnosis of a secondary cancer if
this type of event occurred ﬁrst. we estimated that an initial target
population of 1700 women was needed for the abcsg 6a trial to
have 85% power at a statistical signiﬁcance level of 5% to detect a
30% reduction in recurrence with  xxxd173xxx .
adverse events were only counted once per patient at the time
they ﬁrst occurred and are described by their absolute frequencies
and proportions. differences in adverse event rates were estimated
with odds ratios and corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals from
logistic regression analysis.
all p values are two-sided and were considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant if less than .05. all statistical analyses were performed
using sas software (version 8.02; sas institute inc., cary, nc).

efficacy
women who received 3 years of  xxxd173xxx  as extended adjuvant
therapy experienced statistically significantly fewer recurrences
(i.e., a first occurrence of locoregional, contralateral, or distant
metastatic events) than women who received no extended adjuvant
treatment; these women had a 38% reduced risk of recurrence
(hr = 0.62, 95% ci = 0.40 to 0.96, p = .031) (table 2). the recurrence rate was 11.8% for patients in the no further treatment group
 xxxd1891xxx  years after surgery, compared with 7.1% for patients receiving
adjuvant treatment with  xxxd173xxx . kaplan–meier curves for
recurrence-free survival are presented in fig. 2.
the incidence of recurrence events is shown in table 2. the
difference in assessment intervals between the two groups had no
effect on the total hazard ratio of events (data not shown). when
the recurrence events were considered separately by type, only the
incidence of distant metastatic events differed statistically signiﬁcantly between the study arms (35 events for the no further treatment arm versus 16 events for the  xxxd173xxx  arm; hr = 0.53,
95% ci = 0.29 to 0.96, p = .034). the kaplan–meier curves for
distant metastatic recurrence–free survival began to separate at
approximately 20 months, revealing an advantage for the women
who received  xxxd173xxx  (fig. 3). in addition, the incidence of
recurrence events in trial 6a was lower in patients who had
received tamoxifen plus  xxxd147xxx  in abcsg trial 6
(32 events in 404 patients) than in patients who had received
tamoxifen alone (55 events in 448 patients) (hr = 0.64, 95% ci =
0.41 to 0.98; p = .042).

domization in abcsg trial 6a; 575 women were randomly
assigned to receive no further treatment, and 560 women were
randomly assigned to receive 3 years of  xxxd173xxx . a total of 860
women (470 of the 575 women randomly assigned to no further
treatment and 390 of the 560 women randomly assigned to 3 years
of  xxxd173xxx ) gave written informed consent for entry into trial
6a. four women (one in the no further treatment group and three
in the  xxxd173xxx  group) were ineligible for analysis because of
liver metastases, hysterectomy, malignant melanoma, and undetermined menopausal status. of the 856 women eligible for analysis
(of whom 469 were randomly assigned to no further treatment and
387 to  xxxd173xxx ), 406 (47.4%) had received tamoxifen plus  xxxd147xxx  and 450 (52.6%) had received tamoxifen alone as
adjuvant treatment in trial 6 (table 1). these 856 women were
included in analyses of demographic characteristics, serious adverse
events, and predefined adverse events. the imbalance in number
of women in the two arms of abcsg trial 6a occurred because
prerandomization for trial 6a was performed during abcsg
trial 6, whereas patients’ consent for trial 6a was confirmed at the
completion of abcsg trial 6 to prevent any gap in treatment
between the completion of treatment in abcsg trial 6 and the
commencement of abcsg trial 6a. finally, because of missing
data in abcsg trial 6a, 466 women in the no further treatment
arm and 386 women in the  xxxd173xxx  arm were available for primary outcome assessments (total n = 852).
demographic data and disease characteristics for patients in
abcsg trial 6a are shown in table 1. at prerandomization for
trial 6a, the median age of the patients was 68.1 years (range = 51.8–
85.5 years). median follow-up at this analysis was 62.3 months.

tolerability
overall, 13 serious adverse events occurred during abcsg trial 6a
(seven in the  xxxd173xxx  arm and six in the no further treatment
arm) (table 3). of these events, only one in the  xxxd173xxx  arm
(fracture) was considered by the investigators as being related to
study treatment.
the incidences of predeﬁned adverse events by treatment
group are shown in table 4.  xxxd173xxx  therapy was well tolerated, and the adverse events that were experienced by patients were
as expected in view of available  xxxd173xxx  tolerability data. all of
the adverse events occurred more frequently in patients treated
with  xxxd173xxx  than in patients who received no further treatment. the differences between the study arms were highly statistically signiﬁcant (p<.001) for hot ﬂushes; asthenia, somnolence;
allergy, cutaneous toxicity, skin rash; hair loss; and nausea (all
grade 1 toxic effects).

patients who did not receive  xxxd147xxx  during their adjuvant therapy in abcsg trial 6 (hr = 0.40, 95% ci = 0.22 to 0.73,
p = .002). this subgroup analysis also suggests that among a small
number of patients with er-positive, pgr-negative tumors
(139/852), those who received  xxxd173xxx  had a greater risk of
recurrence than those who received no further treatment (hr =
3.49, 95% ci = 1.31 to 9.30, p = .008).
despite the improvement in recurrence-free survival, there was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference in overall survival between
study arms (55 deaths [11.7%] for the no further treatment arm
versus 40 deaths [10.3%] for the  xxxd173xxx  arm; hr of death
from any cause = 0.89, 95% ci = 0.59 to 1.34, p = .570). in the no
further treatment arm, 25 deaths were breast cancer–related and
30 were due to other causes. in the  xxxd173xxx  arm, 12 deaths
were breast cancer–related and 28 were due to other causes.
overall, 237 women withdrew from abcsg trial 6a before the
3-year period ended (128 [33.1%] from the  xxxd173xxx  group and
109 [23.2%] from the control group). adverse events accounted for
45 withdrawals from the  xxxd173xxx  arm of the trial (two of these
withdrawals were also due to recurrence) but for none of the
withdrawals from the no further treatment arm. there were 25 and
42 withdrawals due to disease recurrence or the appearance of a
secondary tumor in the  xxxd173xxx  arm and no further treatment
arm, respectively, and eight and six additional deaths, respectively.

significantly reduced the risk of recurrence by 38% compared with
no further treatment. this finding is in accordance with results of
the larger ma.17 trial, in which women who received 5 years of
letrozole after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen experienced a 42%
reduction in the risk of recurrence compared with women who
received placebo (12). our data indicate that extended adjuvant
endocrine therapy with  xxxd173xxx  is a valid therapeutic option for
breast cancer patients who have completed 5 years of adjuvant
tamoxifen. furthermore, with a median follow-up of more than
5 years, these data can be considered to be mature.
a potential study limitation is that prerandomization is not
standard practice. we chose to randomly assign all eligible
patients in abcsg trial 6 (i.e., all those who remained in the trial
and disease free) to an arm of trial 6a to ensure that there would
be no gap in treatment between completion of 5 years of primary

adjuvant therapy (abcsg trial 6) and commencement of the
extended study (abcsg trial 6a). however, the number of patients
in the prerandomized treatment groups who gave consent for
trial 6a differed between the groups. in almost all cases, the
decision not to enter trial 6a was because the patient felt that 5
years of adjuvant treatment was sufﬁcient. very few patients
became ineligible because they experienced an event between the
time of the central randomization and the ﬁnal visit for trial 6.
however, the baseline characteristics for the  xxxd173xxx  and no
further treatment groups were well balanced, which suggests that
prerandomization did not cause sufﬁcient bias to invalidate the
study conclusions.
no conclusion should be drawn regarding our observation of
an apparent improvement in outcome for er-positive and pgrpositive patients compared with er-positive and pgr-negative

patients because of the very small number of patients in the latter
group. the same applies to the ﬁnding that extended  xxxd173xxx 
treatment provided no additional beneﬁt for women who had
received  xxxd147xxx  as part of their adjuvant therapy compared with those who had not. subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution and can lead to a substantial amount of
misinterpretation because it is frequently based on small numbers
and thus has low statistical power. for example, in some small
subgroups in the ma.17 trial, a beneﬁt was seen for patients
treated with placebo compared with those who received extended
adjuvant letrozole treatment (12). in addition, other studies that
have examined the effect of aromatase inhibitor treatment in subgroups of patients according to receptor status have suggested that
there is no real difference in treatment effect according to receptor
status (18,19).

the results from abcsg trial 6 showed no statistically signiﬁcant difference in 5-year disease-free survival for adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen plus  xxxd147xxx  compared with
tamoxifen alone (13), indicating that 2 years of this combined adjuvant therapy did not improve the prognosis of patients compared
with tamoxifen monotherapy. however, it is possible that prior
exposure to the aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  in abcsg
trial 6 may have, to some extent, reduced the efﬁcacy of subsequent therapy with a second aromatase inhibitor ( xxxd173xxx )
in this study. breast carcinomas can develop resistance to the
estrogen-deprived environment created by aromatase inhibitor
treatment (20), which may explain the difference in the risk of
recurrence seen between adjuvant pretreatment populations in the
trial 6a subgroup analysis. in this context, it is interesting that data
from patients with advanced breast cancer suggest that nonsteroidal
aromatase inhibitors can have a clinical beneﬁt (deﬁned as complete
responses, partial responses, and disease stabilization for at least 24
weeks) after disease progression occurs during treatment with a
steroidal aromatase inhibitor (21). however, our data cannot provide a detailed assessment of the effect of prior  xxxd147xxx 
therapy on the efﬁcacy of subsequent aromatase inhibitor treatment
because abcsg trial 6a did not examine this comparison. the
lower incidence of recurrence events in trial 6a in patients who had
received tamoxifen plus  xxxd147xxx  in abcsg trial 6
versus in those who had received tamoxifen alone could reﬂect a
carryover effect of  xxxd147xxx  in trial 6. however, there

was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in disease-free survival
between therapy arms in trial 6 (13).
we cannot draw ﬁrm conclusions from the trends indicated in
the abcsg trial 6a subgroup analysis without further investigation in prospectively designed clinical trials. because  xxxd147xxx  is no longer commonly used in the adjuvant setting, such
studies are unlikely to be initiated. however, these efﬁcacy data
indicate that it may be appropriate to investigate the effects of giving a different aromatase inhibitor in the extended adjuvant setting
from that given as adjuvant therapy.
the tolerability proﬁle of  xxxd173xxx  observed in abcsg
trial 6a is consistent with that observed in the 68-month completed treatment analysis of the atac trial (7). the low incidence
of fractures in both arms of this study may reﬂect the protective
effect of 5 years of tamoxifen on bone health (22).
the impact of our data on current practice is unclear.
however, the introduction of an aromatase inhibitor following
adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen has been addressed in an
american society of clinical oncology technology assessment on
adjuvant use of aromatase inhibitors (23), which recommends the
use of the aromatase inhibitor “that has been studied in the setting most closely approximating any individual patient’s clinical
circumstance.” to date,  xxxd173xxx  has shown superiority over
tamoxifen in both the primary adjuvant and switched adjuvant
settings (i.e., completion of the 5-year adjuvant treatment period
with an aromatase inhibitor rather than continuing with tamoxifen after 2 years of treatment) (7–9,11). in addition, the data presented here highlight the potential of  xxxd173xxx  for use in the
extended adjuvant setting. more mature data are awaited for the
primary adjuvant setting with  xxxd173xxx  (atac trial) and for
the primary adjuvant and sequencing settings with letrozole (big
1–98 trial). to date, the only data available for exemestane are in
the switched adjuvant setting from the intergroup exemestane
study at a mean follow-up of 55.7 months (24). therefore, of the
three third-generation aromatase inhibitors,  xxxd173xxx  currently has the most comprehensive dataset relating to adjuvant
therapy.
the apparent beneﬁt of extended adjuvant therapy with aromatase inhibitors raises the question of the optimal duration of adjuvant endocrine treatment with aromatase inhibitors. this question
is being addressed by the ongoing secondary adjuvant long-term
study with  xxxd173xxx  study, which compares 2 years with 5 years of
extended adjuvant  xxxd173xxx  after 5 years of exposure to adjuvant
endocrine therapy (current recruitment exceeds 2000 patients).
the more manageable side effect proﬁle of  xxxd173xxx  compared
with tamoxifen may allow the duration of adjuvant treatment to
extend beyond the 5-year period recommended for tamoxifen.
consequently, we may now be in a position to investigate the possibility of tailoring the duration of adjuvant treatment to the
requirements of individual patients or disease types.
