abstract—ketoprofenoyl-coa thioester 3 was synthesized by coupling  xxxd2423xxx  to  xxxd1739xxx  using the mixed anhydride
method. diastereoisomeric compounds 3a and 3b corresponding to the enantiomers of  xxxd2423xxx , were obtained in optically pure
form by preparative hplc. a non-acylating analogue,  xxxg1512xxx -(3-benzoylphenyl)-2-oxo-butanoyl-coa (7) was also prepared. the
biological evaluation suggested that 3a and 3b are reversible inhibitors of cox-1 and irreversible inhibitors of cox-2. compound
7 appears to be a poor but selective inhibitor of cox-1. # 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

introduction
prostaglandins are active mediators of inﬂammatory
responses and also provide cytoprotection in the stomach and intestine. the key enzyme of their biosynthesis is prostaglandin h2 synthase (pghs or
cyclooxygenase, cox), which converts  xxxd208xxx 
to pgh2, further metabolised by speciﬁc synthases and
isomerases to give various prostanoids. cox exists as
two isoforms: in most tissues, cox-1 is expressed constitutively and cox-2 is transiently up-regulated by
pro-inﬂammatory mediators and down-regulated by
corticosteroids. numerous works in this area suggest
that constitutive cox-1 protects the gi tract, whereas
inducible cox-2 mediates inﬂammation. however,
cox-2 is also involved in ulcer healing, renal physiology, female reproductive process,1 and even in the
resolution of the inﬂammatory response.2,3
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) are
widely used for the treatment of inﬂammation and
articular diseases. their pharmacological activity is
mainly attributed to a competitive inhibition of cox.
as many other xenobiotics, nsaids undergo two
metabolic phases following their absorption: functionalisation, for example oxidative phase, and conjugation,
consisting of the addition of various small hydrophilic

molecules. for most drugs, these metabolic pathways are
hydroxylation and glucuronic acid conjugation. conjugation to glycine,4 lipids incorporation,5 and inversion
of conﬁguration6 are observed in vivo for certain
nsaids, and point out a particular conjugation to  xxxd1739xxx , acting as an intermediate for these reactions.
acyl-coa from diverse drugs have been shown to inhibit
several enzymes like acetyl-coa carboxylase,7 glutathione s transferase 8 and cox.9 since acyl-coa are
chemically activated carboxylic acids, their eﬀects may
be due to their acylating properties and occur by covalent binding. adduct formation has been actually
demonstrated for ﬁbrate derivatives which acylate
unknown proteins.10,11 this ability of adduct formation
is particularly important in the case of carboxylic acidcontaining xenobiotics, since their acyl chain retains the
pharmacological activity and carries the reactive molecule to deﬁnite pharmacological targets.
the aim of this study was to prepare ketoprofenoylcoa 3 and its analogue 7 in order to study their eﬀects
on cox. pharmacological activity often depends on the
absolute conﬁguration of chiral centres in the molecule,
particularly for nsaids for which (s) enantiomer is a
more potent inhibitor of cox than its (r) antipode.12,13 therefore, we describe in this paper the
synthesis of 3 starting from  xxxd2423xxx , and the separation step giving pure (s) and (r) diastereoisomers. in
order to highlight the inactivation mechanism of cox
by acyl-coa, an analogue of ketoprofenoyl-coa was
designed. thus the replacement of the thioester group

by a thiomethylene keto group would provide a nonacylating species. it was assumed that such a slight
modiﬁcation would not aﬀect the recognition of the
inhibitor by cox. the compound selected was  xxxg1512xxx -(3benzoylphenyl)-2-oxo-butanoyl-coa (7).

results
the synthesis of compound 3 was performed by coupling rac-2-(3-benzoylphenyl) xxxd3029xxx  ( xxxd2423xxx  [kpf] 1) to  xxxd1739xxx  ( xxxd1739xxx ) using the mixed
anhydride method14 (scheme 1). formation of the rather
unstable compound 2 was almost achieved quantitatively within 1 h. when at most 10% of the starting
compound 1 was detectable by hplc monitoring,
 xxxd1739xxx  was added to the reaction mixture. the formation of compound 3 was monitored by hplc. after 2 h
of reaction, compound 2 completely disappeared. the
organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure
and unreacted 1 was extracted from the aqueous layer
using hexane. diastereoisomeric compounds 3a and 3b
were obtained in optically pure form after two preparative hplc steps. the ﬁrst one allowed the separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers 3 from residual
reactants; the second one gave pure 3a and 3b. in order
to assign the absolute conﬁguration to compounds 3a
and 3b, the same synthesis was carried out starting
from optically pure r-kpf. however both diastereoisomers were obtained, and the same result was obtained
starting from optically pure s-kpf.
therefore, an epimerisation reaction occurred during
the overall process, as reported by carabaza.15 as
roughly the same diastereoisomeric mixture was
obtained whatever the kpf enantiomer used as the
starting material, assignment of one conﬁguration to
one chromatographic eluate of 3 could not be done at
this stage. microsomial biosynthesis with  xxxg1921xxx  using rains-speciﬁc acyl-coa synthetase 16 produced only
compound 3b, but incubation of 3a or 3b with the
microsomes resulted in the presence of the only 3b,

suggesting an epimerisation, due to epimerase activity.15
it cannot, therefore, be concluded that compound 3b is
(r) ketoprofenoyl-coa. crystallization of each compound 3a and 3b is currently under investigation to
provide a deﬁnitive answer to this issue.
the synthesis of compound 7 was based on the ﬁnal
alkylation of  xxxd1739xxx  using the chloromethylketone
analogue 6 of kpf. the synthesis of 7 is outlined in
scheme 2. ketoprofenyl chloride 4, obtained by reaction of oxalyl chloride with 1, was treated with diazomethane to give rac 3(-3-benzoylphenyl)-2-oxodiazobutane (5). conversion of the crude resulting diazo
group to the corresponding chloride by reaction of an
anhydrous ethereal solution of hydrogen chloride, gave
the compound 6 in 95% overall yield. alkylation of
 xxxd1739xxx  by the compound 6 was performed in a
water– xxxd1898xxx  mixture in the presence of
caesium carbonate. an optimised h2o/dmf ratio of
3:14 gave the best result. contrary to 3, neither analytic
nor semi-preparative hplc allowed diastereoisomeric
puriﬁcation of 7.

biological evaluation
the biological speciﬁcity of the two isoforms of cox
reported before can be used to obtain more eﬃcient
nsaids without gastro-intestinal side eﬀects. most
classical nsaids are reversible or time-dependent
reversible inhibitors, except aspirin which acetylates
ser530 of cox-1 (ser516 of cox-2). they generally
inhibit both cox-1 and cox-2 to diﬀerent extents; for
this reason, extensive studies were conducted in recent
years for the development of new molecules that
selectively inhibits cox-2.17 these studies were based
on crystal structure determinations of the enzymes:12,18

the most striking diﬀerence between the isoforms is that
the active site of cox-1 is more stable and less bulky
than cox-2. 19,20 therefore, most selective inhibitors of
cox-2 display steric groups that hinder their binding
on the active site of cox-1.
the results reported in table 1 show that acyl-coa 3a
and 3b are good inhibitors of both cox-1 and cox-2
with an ic50 one order of magnitude higher than the s
enantiomer of the parent drug. it is worth noting that
they do not present the marked enantioselectivity of
kpf, probably due to epimerisation. reversibility of
the inhibition was tested by recovery experiments, where
inhibitors were carefully removed before measuring the
enzymatic activity. cox incubated with (r) or (s) 1
recovered thus, almost all their catalytic capacity
(ic50 > 10,000), as expected from reversible inhibitors.
in contrast, cox incubated with 3a or 3b were still
inhibited: very weakly for cox-1, since ic50 values
were higher in recovery experiment than during
immediate inhibition, but strongly for cox-2, with
comparable values of ic50 in both conditions. thus, 3a
and 3b appear essentially reversible inhibitors of cox-1
and completely irreversible inhibitors of cox-2.
compound 7 was shown to be a slight inhibitor of both
cox and to be cox-1 selective. as expected, it is a
reversible inhibitor and this argues for an acylation
mechanism responsible for the irreversible inhibition of
cox-2 by kpf acyl-coa. in fact, incubation of  xxxg1884xxx  with 3 resulted in the formation of kpf adducts, as
revealed by western blot experiments, using anti-kpf
antibody (fig. 1). the maximum rate of acylation was
achieved within 1 h and adducts were stable since no
clear diﬀerence in labelling was observed by varying the

for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 h with 3 before western blotting.

incubation time at room temperature from 1 to 11 h
(fig. 2). this conﬁrms that acylation is certainly at the
origin of the irreversible inhibition of cox-2 by ketoprofenoyl-coa.

conclusion
the present work reports the synthesis and the enantiomeric puriﬁcation of ketoprofenoyl-coa (3a, 3b) and its
non-acylating analogue 7. the biological evaluation of
compound 3 showed that it is an irreversible selective
inhibitor of cox-2. this result contributes to better
understand the mechanism of action of nsaids and
their anti-inﬂammatory properties. it is also meaningful
for the research in articular therapeutics, and the development of more eﬃcient drugs without side eﬀects.
besides, acyl-coa are key intermediates in many biochemical pathways, acting as cofactors of enzymes and
as intermediates of protein modiﬁcation, for example
palmitoylation. a convenient way to provide these
intermediates and their non-acylating analogues is of
large interest to elucidate biological processes.21,22
