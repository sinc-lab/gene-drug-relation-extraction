abstract
the effect of a pro-erectile dose of apomorphine, a mixed dopamine receptor agonist, and of pd-168077 (n-[4-(2-cyanophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1ylmethyl]-3-methylbenzamide maleate), a selective dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
on the concentration of extra-cellular dopamine and its main metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) in the dialysate from the
nucleus accumbens was studied in male rats. as expected, apomorphine (0.1 mg) and pd-168077 (0.1 mg) induced penile erection episodes,
which occurred concomitantly to an increase in extra-cellular dopamine and dopac concentration in the dialysate from the shell of the nucleus
accumbens, as measured by intracerebral microdialysis. when induced by apomorphine, these effects were reduced by 80% by raclopride, a selective d2/ xxxg657xxx  antagonist (1 mg) and only by 40e45% by l-745,870 (1 mg), a selective dopamine  xxxg658xxx  antagonist. when induced
by pd-168077, these effects were reduced by more than 80% by l-745,870 (1 mg), but only by 35e40% by raclopride. irrespective of the
dopamine agonist used to induce penile erection, the pro-erectile effect and the concomitant increase in dopamine and dopac concentration
in the nucleus accumbens dialysate were almost completely abolished by d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin(1 mg), a potent  xxxg1642xxx 
antagonist, given into the lateral ventricles. the present results suggest that stimulation of dopamine receptors (mainly of the d2 to d4 subtype)
in the paraventricular nucleus induces the release of oxytocin in brain areas that influence the activity of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons
mediating the appetitive and reinforcing effects of sexual activity. this provides evidence for a role of oxytocin in neural circuits that integrate
the activity of neural pathways controlling the consummatory aspects of sexual behaviour (e.g., penile erection) with those controlling sexual
motivation and sexual arousal.

the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pvn) is
an important integration centre between the central and the peripheral nervous system (swanson and sawchensko, 1983) and
is involved in the control of numerous functions, including
male erectile function and sexual behaviour (see melis and

s. succu et al. / neuropharmacology 52 (2007) 1034e1043

argiolas, 2003; argiolas and melis, 2004, 2005 and references
therein). in particular, the pvn contains the cell bodies of
a group of oxytocinergic neurons that project to extra-hypothalamic brain areas, such as the hippocampus, the medulla
oblongata and the spinal cord, which play an important role
in erectile function and copulatory behaviour (witt and insel,
1994; mckenna, 2000; giuliano and rampin, 2000;
andersson, 2001; hull et al., 2002; argiolas and melis,
1995, 2004, 2005). when activated, for instance by neurotransmitters and/or neuropeptides, these neurons facilitate penile erection and sexual activity, while a reduced erectile
function and sexual activity are found when these neurons
are inhibited. among neurotransmitters present in the pvn,
dopamine is one of the most studied of those that activate oxytocinergic neurons and facilitate penile erection and sexual activity. in the hypothalamus dopamine is localized in neurons
that belong to the so called incerto-hypothalamic dopaminergic system. these neurons originate in the dopamine cell
a14 group of dahlstrom and fuxe (1964), arborize extensively and innervate several hypothalamic nuclei, such as the
medial preoptic area and the paraventricular nucleus (see
lindvall et al., 1984; buijs et al., 1984). here dopamine acts
mainly on dopamine receptors of the d2 type to increase
ca2þ influx in the cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons leading
to penile erection (see eaton et al., 1991; melis and argiolas,
2003; argiolas and melis, 2004, 2005). this causes the activation of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) synthase, the ca2þ-calmodulin enzyme that converts l-arginine to no (ignarro, 1990), which
is present in high concentration in the pvn, including the
cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons (vincent and kimura,
1992; torres et al., 1993; sanchez et al., 1994; sato-suzuki
et al., 1998). no in turn activates oxytocinergic neurons to release oxytocin in extra-hypothalamic brain areas, mainly the
hippocampus (melis et al., 1992) and the spinal cord (wagner
and clemens, 1993; veronneau-longueville et al., 1999) to induce penile erection by a still unknown mechanism (reviewed
in argiolas and melis, 2005). the above mechanisms are also
active in the pvn when penile erection occurs in physiological
contexts, such as during pheromone-induced noncontact erections, which are observed when sexually potent male rats are
put into the presence of an inaccessible receptive female
(sachs et al., 1994), or during copulation, when in copula penile erections occur. accordingly, no synthase inhibitors injected into the pvn and  xxxg1642xxx  antagonists
injected into the lateral ventricles inhibit noncontact erections
and copulation (melis et al., 1998, 1999), and microdialysis
studies show that no production (melis et al., 1998) and extra-cellular dopamine concentration increase in the pvn in
these experimental circumstances (melis et al., 2003). as noncontact erections are considered a measure of sexual arousal
(e.g., a main component of appetitive phase of sexual behaviour) (sachs, 2000), the above findings suggest that dopamine
in the pvn may play a role not only in erectile function (e.g.,
a main component of the consummatory phase of sexual behaviour), but also in sexual motivation (melis et al., 2003),
as suggested for dopamine in the medial preoptic area (hull
et al., 1995). interestingly, another area in which microdialysis

1035

studies provided evidence for an increase in dopamine neurotransmission during sexual activity is the nucleus accumbens
(pfaus and everitt, 1995). this nucleus contains the nerve endings of the mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons that mediate the
pleasurable effects of natural reinforcers, such as food and sex,
hence playing a key role in sexual motivation and rewarding
(fibiger and phillips, 1988; everitt, 1990; pfaus and everitt,
1995; liu et al., 1998). more important for this study, the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons may be influenced by the ventral tegmental area, the hippocampus and/or
the amygdala, which all receive oxytocinergic projections
from the pvn (sofroniew, 1983; roeling et al., 1993), in several circumstance (see floresco et al., 2001a,b). this raises the
possibility that the activation of dopamine receptors in the
pvn not only causes penile erection by activating oxytocinergic neurons projecting to the spinal cord, but also influences
sexual motivation by influencing the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. in order to test this hypothesis, we
studied the effect of a pro-erectile dose of apomorphine, a classic mixed dopamine receptor agonist that activates all
dopamine receptor subtypes (see hsieh et al., 2004), and of
pd-168077, a selective dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonist (heier
et al., 1997), injected into the pvn (see melis and argiolas,
1995, 2003; melis et al., 2005, 2006; bitner et al., 2006), on
the release of dopamine by mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons
in the nucleus accumbens, by intracerebral microdialysis.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male spragueedawley rats (250e300 g) (charles river, como, italy)
were used in all the experiments. the animals were caged in groups of 4e6
at 24  c, humidity 60%, lights on from 07:00 to 19:00 h with water and standard laboratory food ad libitum. the experiments were performed between
09:00 and 13:00 h. all experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines of the european communities directive of 24 november 1986
(86/609/eec) and the italian legislation (d.p.r. 116/92).

2.2. drugs and peptides
apomorphine-hcl was purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa);
pd-168077 (n-[4-(2-cyanophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]-3-methylbenzamide
maleate), l-745,870 (3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]-1h-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine trihydrochloride) and raclopride from tocris cookson
ltd (bristol, uk); d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin from bachem ag (ch).

2.3. microinjections into the paraventricular nucleus or into the
lateral ventricles and microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens
microinjections and microdialysis were performed in the same male rat
implanted with either a chronic guide cannula aimed at the pvn or a microdialysis probe directed into the shell of the nucleus accumbens. briefly, a stainlesssteel guide cannula (22 gauge) aimed unilaterally at the pvn (coordinates:
0.2 mm anterior to bregma, 0.4 lateral to midline and 2.0 mm ventral to
dura) (pellegrino and cushman, 1971) and a microdialysis probe with a ushaped dialysis membrane (approximately 2 mm of free surface for dialysis),
prepared as previously described (melis et al., 1996, 2003), aimed unilaterally
at the nucleus accumbens (coordinates: 3.2 mm anterior to bregma, 0.8 mm
lateral to midline and 7.0 mm ventral to dura) (pellegrino and cushman,
1971), ipsilateral to the microinjection cannula aimed at the pvn, were

1036

s. succu et al. / neuropharmacology 52 (2007) 1034e1043

implanted stereotaxically during the same stereotaxic surgery under chloral
hydrate anaesthesia (400 mg/kg i.p.). animals were given 2 days to recover
from surgery; each rat was used only once.
for pvn microinjections, apomorphine-hcl dissolved in saline or pd168077 dissolved in dimethylsulphoxyde (dmso) and diluted with distilled
water or vehicle alone was injected into the pvn in a volume of 0.3 ml in
2 min via an internal cannula (28 gauge), which extended 5.3 mm below the
tip of the guide cannula and connected by polyethylene tubing to a 10-ml hamilton syringe driven by a stoelting microsyringe pump (stoelting co., wood
dale, il, usa). after injection, the tip of the cannula was left in the injection
site for 30 s to allow the spreading of the injected solution.
in those experiments in which raclopride or l-745,870 was used, the two
compounds were dissolved in saline and injected into the pvn in a volume of
0.3 ml over a period of 2 min, 15 min before each dopamine receptor agonist.
when the  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin was
used, the compound was dissolved in saline and injected i.c.v. in a volume
of 10 ml over a period of 2 min 15 min before each dopamine receptor agonist
with a microinjection cannula, which extended 2.3 mm below the tip of the
guide cannula, and was connected by polyethylene tubing to a 10-ml hamilton
syringe driven by a stoelting microsyringe pump (stoelting co., wood dale,
il, usa).
for intracerebral microdialysis, the microdialysis probe aimed at the shell
of the nucleus accumbens was perfused with ringer’s solution, containing
147 mm nacl, 3 mm kcl and 1.2 mm cacl2, ph 6.5, at a constant flow
rate of 2.5 ml/min by using a stoelting microsyringe pump. after a 2-h equilibration period, the dialysate was collected every 15 min in aliquots of 37.5 ml
in polyethylene tubes kept at 10e15  c for the determination of dopamine and
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) concentrations, as described below.
after the collection of three dialysate aliquots, apomorphine-hcl or pd168077 was dissolved in appropriate vehicle, and injected into the pvn in
a volume of 0.3 ml. rats were observed for 75 min, during which five
additional dialysate fractions of 37.5 ml each were collected every 15 min
and penile erection episodes were counted. in those experiments in which
dopamine receptor antagonists were used, these compounds were dissolved
in saline and microinjected into the pvn in a volume of 0.3 ml 15 min before
the dopamine receptor agonist. when the  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist was
used, the compound dissolved in saline was microinjected i.c.v. in a volume
of 10 ml 15 min before each dopamine receptor agonist.

when the  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist was used, this was given i.c.v.
15 min before each dopamine receptor agonist. after treatments, rats were
observed for the entire duration of the experiment in order to count penile
erection episodes and to replace filled loops with empty ones every 15 min.
penile erections were scored when the penis emerged from the penile sheath,
which was usually accompanied by penile grooming and hip flexions.

2.6. histology
at the end of the experiments the animals were killed by decapitation, the
brains were immediately removed and stored in 2% aqueous formaldehyde for
12e15 days. to localise the position of the probe tip, 50 mm transverse brain
sections were prepared by means of a freezing microtome, stained with
neutral red and inspected on a phase contrast microscope. the position of
the tip of the microinjection cannula in the pvn or directed i.c.v. and the
tip of the microdialysis probe in the nucleus accumbens were localized by
following their tract through a series of brain sections. only those animals
found to have the tip of the microinjection cannula positioned correctly into
the pvn or i.c.v. and the tip of the dialysis probe positioned correctly in
the shell of the nucleus accumbens (fig. 1) were considered for the statistical
evaluation of the results.

2.7. statistics
for the statistical evaluation of the results, the area under the curves (auc)
obtained by plotting penile erection, dopamine and dopac values versus time

2.4. determination of dopamine and dopac concentration
in the nucleus accumbens dialysate
dopamine and dopac concentrations were measured in the same sample of
nucleus accumbens dialysate (20 ml), by high pressure liquid chromatography
(hplc) on a 7.5 cm  3.0 mm i.d., supelcosil c18, 3 mm particle size column
(supelco, supelchem, milan, italy) coupled to electrochemical detection
(coulochem ii, esa, cambridge, ma, usa) using a 4011 dual cell, as already
described (melis et al., 2003). detection was performed in reduction mode with
potentials set to þ350 and 180 mv. the mobile phase was 0.06 m citrate/acetate ph 4.2, containing methanol 20% v/v, 0.1 mm edta, 1 mm trimethylamine, 0.03 mm  xxxd3215xxx  at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. the
sensitivity of the assay was 0.125 pg for dopamine and 0.1 pg for dopac.

2.5. behavioural studies
rats were placed individually in plexiglass cages (30  30  30 cm). after
a 30 min habituation period, microdialysis into the nucleus accumbens was
started by connecting the microdialysis probe via polyethylene tubing to
a 1000 ml hamilton microsyringe driven by a stoelting microsyringe pump
on one end and to the polyethylene collecting loop on the other hand. after
a 2 h equilibration period of perfusion of the dialysis probe with the ringer’s
solution (see above), a dopamine receptor agonist dissolved in appropriate
vehicle (saline for apomorphine and dmso diluted with distilled water for
pd-168077) or vehicle alone was microinjected into the pvn through the
microinjection cannula connected by polyethylene tubing to a stoelting 200
microsyringe pump. when dopamine receptor antagonists were used, these
were given into the pvn 15 min before the dopamine receptor agonist.

penile erections/rat

under the experimental conditions used in this study, the
amounts of dopamine and dopac in the dialysate obtained
from the nucleus accumbens of male rats found to have the tip
of the microinjection cannula positioned correctly into the
pvn were 2.3  0.4 pg of dopamine and 15.2  2.5 pg of
dopac in a volume of 20 ml of dialysate, values corresponding
to a concentration of 0.6 nm for dopamine and 4.5 nm for
dopac, respectively (fig. 2). the above values were found in
the nucleus accumbens dialysate after a perfusion period of at
least 2 h to equilibrate the perfusion buffer with the extra-cellular fluid. as the recovery of authentic dopamine and dopac
passed throughout the probe was approximately 20% and
19%, respectively, dopamine and dopac concentrations in
the nucleus accumbens extra-cellular fluid may be estimated
to be close to 2.5 nm and 24 nm, respectively. these values
are similar to those found by other authors (imperato et al.,
1988; pfaus and everitt, 1995, and references therein).
apomorphine (0.1 mg) and pd-168077 (0.1 mg) injected into
the pvn induced penile erection as expected (see melis et al.,
1987, 1996, 2006). this occurred concomitantly to an increase
in the concentration of extra-cellular dopamine and dopac in
the nucleus accumbens dialysate, which was already detected
15 min after treatment and lasted for at least 45 min (fig. 2).
briefly, apomorphine increased penile erection episodes from
0.31  0.02 to 4.5  0.32 and dopamine and dopac from
2.3  0.4 to 4.8  0.8 and from 15.4 1.4 to 21.3  1.6, respectively. similar results were obtained with pd-168077, which
increased penile erection episodes from 0.30  0.02 to
2.3  0.2 and dopamine and dopac from 2.4  0.5 to
3.8  0.4 and from 15.2  1.9 to 17.8  1.4, respectively. accordingly the aucs of apomorphine and pd-168077 for penile
erection, dopamine and dopac were significantly higher than
those of vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.01). however, the aucs of
apomorphine were significantly higher than those of pd168077 (p < 0.01) (table 1).

in dmso or saline or dmso alone was injected (volume 0.3 ml) into the
pvn after a 2 h period of perfusion of the microdialysis probe aimed at the
nucleus accumbens as described in section 2. after injection, male rats
were observed for 75 min to count penile erection episodes and to replace
filled loops with empty ones. dopamine and dopac were immediately

detection. values are mean  sem of seven rats per group. *p < 0.01 with

of dopamine and dopac concentration in the nucleus accumbens dialysate induced by apomorphine (0.1 mg) when injected
into the pvn 15 min before the dopamine receptor agonist

apomorphine effects was found with l-745,870 (1 mg), a selective dopamine  xxxg658xxx  antagonist given into the pvn
15 min before apomorphine (fig. 3a). accordingly, the
aucs of raclopride or l-745,870 þ apomorphine-treated rats

and dopac concentration induced by this compound only by
35e40% (fig. 3b). in contrast, l-745,870 (1 mg) reduced pd168077 effects by more than 80% (fig. 3b). accordingly, the

4. discussion
the present results confirm that apomorphine, a mixed
dopamine receptor agonist that acts on all dopamine receptor
subtypes (d1 to d5), and pd-168077, a selective dopamine
 xxxg658xxx  agonist (heier et al., 1997), induce penile erection
when injected into the pvn of male rats (see melis et al.,
2005, 2006), and show for the first time that both compounds
increase the concentration of extra-cellular dopamine and its
main metabolite dopac in the dialysate from the shell of
the nucleus accumbens. this brain area contains the nerve
endings of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons originating in
the ventral tegmental area (see dahlstrom and fuxe, 1964).
these neurons play a key role in motivational and rewarding
properties of natural reinforcers, such as food and sexual activity and even of drugs of abuse (see fibiger and phillips, 1988;
everitt, 1990; pfaus and everitt, 1995; wise and rompre,
1989). these findings suggest that activation of dopamine
receptors in the pvn not only facilitates erectile function
but also activates neural circuits in the brain, which lead to
the activation of this motivational and rewarding system.
this may contribute to increase sexual motivation and sexual
arousal, which usually anticipate the consummatory aspects of
copulation. this may occur when sexually potent male rats are
put into the presence of an inaccessible receptive female.
these rats usually show pheromone-mediated noncontact
erections (sachs et al., 1994; liu et al., 1997; melis et al.,
1998; sachs, 2000), which occur concomitantly to an increase
in extra-cellular dopamine and dopac in the pvn (melis
et al., 2003). the dopamine increase is even higher in the

pvn when male rats are allowed to copulate with the receptive
female (melis et al., 2003). as sexual pheromones act in the
medial preoptic area and the amygdala (see liu et al.,
1997), it is likely that these sexual stimuli activate neural circuits including the pvn, to facilitate penile erection, one of
the consummatory components of sexual activity, and the nucleus accumbens, in which dopamine is thought to mediate the
transposition of motivational aspects into goal-directed behaviours (goto and grace, 2005). in line with this hypothesis, an
increase in dopamine similar to that induced by dopamine
agonists found in this study, occurs in the nucleus accumbens
during noncontact erections and copulation (pfaus and everitt,
1995). interestingly, the concentration of dopamine in the
nucleus accumbens dialysate is close to that found capable
of stimulating calcium influx in cell lines expressing cloned
rat d4 receptors coupled to a chimeric g protein (moreland
et al., 2005) more than to that found capable of inhibiting
 xxxd1742xxx  activated camp production or gtpgammas protein
activity in cells expressing d4 receptors only (gazi et al.,

2000). however, as a similar potency of dopamine on the
above activities is often found in different cell lines expressing
rat dopamine d4 receptors (see hsieh et al., 2004; brioni
et al., 2004 and references therein), the significance of this
finding is unknown.
in line with earlier studies, dopamine receptors in the pvn
that facilitate penile erection and increase dopamine release in
the nucleus accumbens, belong to the dopamine d2-like receptor family, which includes d2, d3 and d4 receptors (see melis
et al., 1987; melis and argiolas, 1995; hsieh et al., 2004). accordingly, either apomorphine, which stimulates all dopamine
receptor subtypes, or pd-168077, which stimulates selectively
dopamine d4 receptors (heier et al., 1997) (but see glase
et al., 1997), injected into the pvn increase dopamine concentration in the nucleus accumbens dialysate. all dopamine d2like receptors (d2, d3 and d4) may be involved, as raclopride,
a potent d2/ xxxg657xxx  antagonist, reduces penile erection
and dopamine increase in the nucleus accumbens almost
completely when induced by apomorphine, but only partially

fig. 4. effect of d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin (oxy ant) on apomorphine
(apo) and pd-168077-induced penile erection and on the increase of dopamine and dopac in the nucleus accumbens dialysate. d(ch2)5tyr(me)2orn8-vasotocin (1 mg) dissolved in saline was injected into the lateral ventricles
in a volume of 10 ml 15 min before apomorphine (0.1 mg) or pd-168077
(0.1 mg). the other experimental conditions were identical to those reported
in the legend of fig. 2. values are mean  sem of seven rats per group.
*p < 0.01 with respect to vehicle-treated rats; #p < 0.01 with respect to the
corresponding group treated with apomorphine or pd-168077 alone (manne
whitney u test).

when induced by pd-168077, while l-745840, a selective d4
receptor antagonist (patel et al., 1997) reduces almost completely these responses when induced by pd-168077, but
only partially when induced by apomorphine. these findings
resemble the partial reduction by l-745,870 of apomorphine-induced penile erection and of the concomitant increase
in no production, which occurs in the pvn, when compared
to the almost complete reduction by this dopamine  xxxg658xxx  antagonist of these effects induced by pd-168077 and by
pip3ea, another recently characterized  xxxg658xxx  agonist
with pro-erectile activity (melis et al., 2005, 2006). these
data are in contrast with other studies which support a main
role of dopamine d4 receptors in penile erection and rule

out d2 receptors in dopamine receptor agonist-induced penile
erection (hsieh et al., 2004). this was inferred by the inability
of pnu 95666e, a selective  xxxg656xxx  agonist,
given systemically to induce penile erections in male rats
when compared to apomorphine (see hsieh et al., 2004).
this discrepancy might be only apparent, as dopamine receptor agonists in the present and other studies (melis et al., 2005,
2006) were injected directly into the pvn. indeed, this rules
out effects of these compounds on other brain regions, which
usually occur when drugs are given systemically. nevertheless, further studies with more selective dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists of the various dopamine receptor
subtypes are necessary to clarify the extent to which dopamine
d2, d3 and d4 receptors in the pvn participate in penile erection. these studies will also contribute to explain the higher
effect of apomorphine on penile erection and on the increase
of extra-cellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens dialysate
when compared to selective dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonists
(see melis et al., 2006).
as to the mechanism by means of which apomorphine and
pd-168077 increase extra-cellular dopamine in the nucleus
accumbens, the ability of d(ch2)5tyr(me)2-orn8-vasotocin,
a potent  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist (bankowski et al.,
1980), given i.c.v. to reduce almost completely the increase
of dopamine concentration, shows that this effect is mediated
by the release of oxytocin in extra-hypothalamic brain areas,
as already shown for penile erection. while the spinal cord
is commonly considered as one of the main sites in which oxytocin is released to induce penile erection (see argiolas and
melis, 2004, 2005), the brain areas in which oxytocin is released to influence the activity of mesolimbic dopaminergic
neurons are unknown. central oxytocinergic neurons originate
in the pvn and project to several extra-hypothalamic areas.
these include the ventral tegmental area, the septum, the hippocampus, the pons (motor nucleus of the vagus nerve) and the
spinal cord (see sofroniew, 1983; buijs et al., 1978; roeling
et al., 1993), all of which contain oxytocinergic fibers (roeling
et al., 1993), oxytocin receptors and  xxxg1642xxx  messenger rna (freund-mercier et al., 1987; vaccari et al., 1998).
among these, one of the best candidates in which oxytocin,
released by the stimulation of paraventricular dopamine receptors, may act to increase dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens, is the ventral tegmental area. indeed, this area
contains the cell bodies of dopaminergic neurons projecting
to the nucleus accumbens, which may be directly influenced
by oxytocin. other areas are the hippocampus and/or the
amygdala. accordingly, oxytocin injected bilaterally into the
ca1 field of the hippocampus induces penile erection (melis
et al., 1987), apomorphine at doses that induce penile erection
increases oxytocin concentration in the hippocampus and in
plasma (melis et al., 1990), and lesions of the septum, which
decreases oxytocin content in the hippocampus, reduces
apomorphine-induced penile erection (melis et al., 1992).
oxytocin injected into the hippocampus also excites inhibitory
interneurons that influence the activity of hippocampal efferent pathways (raggenbass et al., 1985). recent electrophysiological studies have also shown that the hippocampus and the

s. succu et al. / neuropharmacology 52 (2007) 1034e1043

amygdala can influence the activity of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons by modulating the activity of glutamatergic neurons, which act presynaptically in the nucleus accumbens to
stimulate dopamine release (blaha et al., 1997; floresco
et al., 2001a,b). the above possibilities may be not mutually
exclusive.
although further studies are necessary to identify the brain
areas in which oxytocin is released to increase dopamine
release in the nucleus accumbens, the ability of dopamine receptor agonists to increase the activity of mesolimbic dopamine neurons by releasing oxytocin when given into the
pvn at doses that induce penile erection, deserves further
considerations. first, these findings raise the possibility that
the pro-erectile effect of oxytocin given i.c.v. may be mediated, at least partially, by its ability to release dopamine in
the nucleus accumbens and/or in other extra-hypothalamic
areas. in line with this hypothesis, clozapine, which blocks
all  xxxg656xxx  subtypes with more efficacy on
d4 receptors, given systemically has been recently found capable of reducing penile erection induced by i.c.v. oxytocin
(martino et al., 2005). in this study, clozapine was also found
capable of reducing penile erection induced by oxytocin given
intratecally. as a spinal site of action for apomorphine has
been recently identified (giuliano et al., 2002), this has led
to the suggestion that the spinal cord may be another site in
which oxytocin acts to release dopamine to induce penile
erection (martino et al., 2005). against this hypothesis, haloperidol, which blocks all  xxxg656xxx  subtypes with
similar efficacy, and () sulpiride, another dopamine d2/d3
antagonist, exert only scarce effects on i.c.v. oxytocin-induced penile erection (and yawning) when given systemically
at doses that completely antagonize the above responses when
induced by apomorphine (see argiolas and melis, 1995 and
references therein). as clozapine was given only systemically
in the above study, it is impossible to rule out the possibility
that this drug reduces oxytocin response by acting in brain
areas different from those involved in penile erection and/or
on receptors different from the dopaminergic ones. this
discrepancy may be resolved only by identifying the site of action and the mechanism by means of which clozapine reduces
oxytocin-induced penile erection.
second, the present findings raise the question whether an
activation of mesolimbic dopamine neurons occurs when dopamine receptor agonists are also given systemically at doses
that induce penile erection. earlier studies have shown that dopamine receptor agonists of the d2 type family decrease rather
than increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. the
decrease was explained by an action of these drugs on dopamine d2 autoreceptors localized in dopaminergic nerve endings (see imperato et al., 1988). this may suggest that
dopamine receptor agonists given systemically reduce rather
than increase the activity of mesolimbic neurons, thereby
influencing in a negative fashion motivation and rewarding.
however, this is unlikely, as dopamine receptor agonists given
systemically act not only on dopamine autoreceptors, but also
on all dopamine receptors, that is they replace dopamine at all
levels including motivation and rewarding circuits. this aspect

1041

has also clinical relevance. indeed, apomorphine is a drug
commercially available for the oral therapy of erectile dysfunction in men, although with scarce success, when compared
to orally active phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (see argiolas, 2005 and references therein). it is likely that this is due to
the adverse effects of the drug common to many dopamine d2
receptor agonists, caused by the stimulation of dopamine d2
receptors in the chemotrigger zone of the medulla oblongata
(e.g., nausea and vomiting) rather than to a decrease in sexual
motivation or libido (see argiolas, 2005). these adverse effects should not occur with dopamine  xxxg658xxx  agonists
(brioni et al., 2004). in line with the above hypothesis, neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that apomorphine
induces a stronger activation of cortical and subcortical brain
areas, including the nucleus accumbens during visual sexual
stimulation (montorsi et al., 2003).
in conclusion, the present study shows for the first time that
the stimulation of dopamine receptors of the d2 family, including d4 receptors in the pvn, not only induces penile erection, but also increases extra-cellular dopamine release in the
nucleus accumbens. this effect is mediated by the activation
of central oxytocinergic neurons, which release oxytocin in
extra-hypothalamic brain areas (possibly the ventral tegmental
area and/or the hippocampus/amygdala). oxytocin in turn
activates neural circuits modulating the activity of mesolimbic
dopaminergic neurons, which are involved in the appetitive
and rewarding effects of sexual activity. as dopamine is released in the pvn when penile erection occurs in physiological contexts (e.g., noncontact erections and copulation) (melis
et al., 2003), these findings provide further evidence for a role
of dopamine in the pvn not only in the consummatory phase
of sexual behaviour (e.g., penile erection) but also in sexual
motivation and sexual reward.
