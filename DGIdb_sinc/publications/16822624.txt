abstract
tamoxifen is the endocrine agent most commonly used at all stages of breast cancer.  xxxg730xxx  (er) ␣, which belongs
to the superfamily of nuclear receptors, has been used to identify breast cancer patients who are likely to respond to tamoxifen,
but resistance nonetheless occurs in 30–50% of treated er␣-positive breast cancer patients.
the antiproliferative activity of tamoxifen, relying primarily on its ability to compete with estrogen for the er␣ ligand binding
site in breast tumor tissue, hypotheses forwarded to explain treatment failure include: (1) the existence of a second estrogen
receptor (er␤), (2) an imbalance in estrogen biosynthesis and catabolism, (3) altered bioavailability of tamoxifen, (4) altered
cellular trafficking of er␣, (5) non genomic effects of er␣, directly interacting with several signal transduction pathways,
and (6) transcriptional dysregulation of er␣ target genes, which may involve both genomic (ere alteration) and non genomic
alterations.

a first non genomic alteration involves the regulation of er␣ activity by its phosphorylation mediated by growth factorskinases signaling pathways. a second non genomic alteration, which is the purpose of this review, involves regulatory factors
(coregulators) known as coactivators and corepressors, which activate (or repress) the transcription of er␣-responsive genes.
the regulation process involves both chromatin remodeling and er␣ interaction with the transcriptional machinery. thus,
dysregulated expression (coactivator overexpression or corepressor underexpression) and/or mutation of these coregulators is
thought to impair the action of tamoxifen.
many altered pathways may account for tamoxifen resistance which may be best studied by multigene approaches.

1. introduction
 xxxg730xxx  (er) ␣ belongs to the superfamily of steroid nuclear receptor transcriptional
factors. on binding to specific dna sequences such as
estrogen-responsive elements (ere), estrogen–er␣
complexes activate or repress target gene transcription,
regulating the proliferation and differentiation of
many tissues, including reproductive tissues, and also
promoting breast cancer growth [1,2].
tamoxifen is the endocrine agent most commonly
used to block the effects of estrogen at all stages of
breast cancer, particularly in post-menopausal patients.
er␣ status has been used to identify breast cancer
patients who are likely to respond to tamoxifen, but
resistance nonetheless occurs in 30 to 50% of treated
er␣-positive breast cancer patients [3].
the antiproliferative activity of tamoxifen, relying
primarily on its ability to compete with estrogen for
the er␣ ligand binding site in breast tumor tissue,
suggests that qualitative alterations of er␣ expression may be primarily implicated in tamoxifen resistance. however, studies have failed to demonstrate
a major link between specific er␣ variants and/or
er␣ mutations and tamoxifen resistance, therefore
other hypotheses have been investigated to explain
treatment failure (fig. 1), which include [4,5]: (1)
the existence of a second  xxxg730xxx  (er␤),
(2) an imbalance between estrogen biosynthesis and
catabolism, (3) altered tamoxifen bioavailability, regulated by xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, (4) altered
cellular trafficking of er␣, mediated by chaperone
molecules such as heat shock proteins, (5) non genomic
effects of er␣, directly interacting with several signal
transduction pathways, and (6) transcriptional dysregulation of er␣ target genes, which may involve both
genomic (ere alterations) and non genomic alter-

ations. a first non genomic alteration involve the regulation of er␣ activity by its phosphorylation mediated
by growth factors-kinases signaling pathways [6,7].
this review focuses on a second non genomic alteration of er␣ transcriptional activity which involves
regulatory factors (coregulators) known as coactivators and corepressors, which activate (or repress) the
transcription of er␣-responsive genes. indeed, dysregulated expression (coactivator overexpression or
corepressor underexpression) and/or mutation of these
coregulators in breast tumors is thought to impair the
effect of antiestrogens. dysregulations of these coregulators in breast tumors will be examined, and clinical
studies of coregulators involvement in tamoxifen resistance will be reviewed.

2. coregulators involved in er␣
transcriptional activity
er␣ transcriptional activation of target genes results
from close interplay between the receptor, the ligand (agonist), dna estrogen-response element (ere)
and coactivators, which together trigger nucleosome
disruption and permit rna polymerase complex transcription activity (fig. 2).
since the discovery of src1 ( xxxg1510xxx ) in 1995,
numerous other transcriptional coactivator genes have
been identified [8,9].
src1, like  xxxg1511xxx  (also named  xxxg1511xxx  or  xxxg1511xxx ) and
 xxxg1512xxx  ( xxxg1512xxx ,  xxxg1512xxx ), are related coactivators belonging to the  xxxg1449xxx  steroid receptor coactivator (src)
family, members of which enhance er␣ transcriptional activity in a ligand-dependent manner. their
transcriptional activity depends on protein–protein
interactions with er␣ and other coactivators such as
cbp and p300 (see below). members of the src fam-

trafficking of er␣, mediated by chaperone molecules, including heat shock proteins, (5) non genomic effects of er␣, directly interacting with
several signal transduction pathways ( xxxg2198xxx  receptors), and (6) transcriptional dysregulation of er target genes, which may involve

ily have histone acetyltransferase (hat) enzymatic
activity which weakens histone–dna interactions
[9].
with regard to antiestrogens, the agonistic activity
of 4oh-tamoxifen (an active metabolite of tamoxifen)
is mediated by src1, which interacts with the
er␣ af1 domain, supporting the hypothesis of the
agonist/antagonist activity of mixed antiestrogen, like
tamoxifen, to depend on the cellular and promoter
context [10].
tif1␣ (trim24) interacts in a ligand-dependent
manner with ere-bound er␣, only in the presence
of estradiol. functional analysis shows that tif1␣
possesses intrinsic kinase activity which permits not
only its own phosphorylation but also selective phos-

phorylation of members of the basal transcriptional
machinery [11].
ara70 (ncoa4) and ara54 belong to a group
of  xxxg183xxx -associated proteins which have
been reported primarily to bind to and modulate the
transcriptional activity of the  xxxg183xxx , but
also modulate er␣ activity to a lesser extent [9].
sra is unique among coactivators, in that it activates transcription through the af1 domain as an rna
molecule instead of a protein. this coactivator coimmunoprecipates with src1 [12].
cbp and p300 are related proteins with histone
acetyltransferase activity involved in a broad range
of molecular pathways (including many nuclear
receptors), in which they act as “integrators” of

various cellular signals. er␣ transcriptional activity
is synergistically enhanced upon cbp/p300 interaction with src1 [13]. cbp and p300 may recruit
other proteins with hat activity, such as  xxxg1227xxx 
and  xxxg1226xxx  ( xxxg1226xxx ), which together enhance
chromatin remodeling, thereby facilitating gene
transcription.
regulation of transcription activation may also
involve proteins with methyltransferase activity, such
as carm1, which methylates both histones and other
proteins of the transcription initiation complex [14].
er␣ transcriptional activation also involves the
recruitment of the atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complex known as swi/snf (composed of
several polypeptide subunits such as  xxxg2173xxx , hbrm,
baf60b and  xxxg2175xxx ), which is targeted to promoters
by interacting with the  xxxg1449xxx  family of transcription
coactivators [15].
finally, a member of a the ubiquitin-proteasomemediated degradation pathway, has been described to

act as a coactivator, indeed e6-ap (ube3a), previously
identified as a ubiquitin-protein ligase, has been found
to activate in a hormone-dependent manner several
members of the nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  superfamily including er␣ [16].
because all coactivators have a common
transcription-activating effect, the redundant and/or
specific functions of each coactivator remain to be
determined.
fewer corepressor than coactivator genes have been
identified, suggesting they may have a rate-limiting
effect. two major corepressors, ncor1 and smrt
(ncor2), have been shown to interact with er␣
when complexed to 4oh-tamoxifen [17,18]. this
points to an additional mechanism of tamoxifen
antiproliferative activity (along with its competitive
effect on er␣ binding sites), leading to abnormal
transcriptional regulation of er␣ target genes and
recruitment of coregulators that do not normally interact with estrogen–er␣ complexes [19]. these two

346

i. girault et al. / maturitas 54 (2006) 342–351

corepressors belong to larger protein complexes with
histone deacetylase activity (hdac) (ncor- xxxg1035xxx ,
sin3 complex) which promote chromatin condensation
and lead to target-gene silencing [20,21]. it is noteworthy that the er␣–oh-tamoxifen complex has been
shown to recruit the nurd chromatin-remodeling
complex in which hdac1 is associated with several polypeptides including mta1 and mta1l1
[18,22].
studies have also linked hdac containing complexes with dnmts genes, which belong to a family of
proteins that methylate dna—another gene silencing
mechanism [23,24].
also important is the rea gene, which inhibits e2stimulated reporter gene interaction with er␣ bound to
estradiol or 4oh-tamoxifen. rea has also been shown
to increase antiestrogen activity and to compete with
the src1 coactivator [25].
 xxxg1607xxx  (nrip) has been identified as having a
repressor function mediated only by agonist-liganded
receptors (including er␣) [26].
finally, members of the ubiquitin-proteasomemediated degradation pathway have also been
described to act as corepressors of er␣ transcriptional activity, indeed the ubiquitin-activating enzymes
ube1c and sug1 have been shown to be involved in
proteasome-mediated degradation of human estrogen
receptor (er␣) [27,28].
together these results suggest that the transcriptional activity of estrogen/antiestrogen in a given cell
type may depend on the abundance, activity and affinity
of each coregulator [29].
tamoxifen resistance, mediated by coregulators, has
been mostly investigated with the first coactivators and
corepressors identified, that is  xxxg1449xxx  coactivators family
and ncor/smrt corepressors [18,30,31]. implication of more recently identified coregulators such as,
cia ( xxxg1513xxx ), asc2 (ncoa6), erap140 (ncoa7),
pelp1, cited1, xbp-1, erbp (coactivators [32–38])
or rta,  xxxg2171xxx , err10, spbp, safb1 (corepressors [39–43]), remains to be determined in the field
of tamoxifen resistance.
it should be noted that while some of the coregulator genes described here indeed regulate er␣
transcriptional activity, they are not fully er␣specific, as they may interact with other nuclear
receptors but also with transcription factor unrelated
to the superfamily of nuclear receptor transcriptional

factors [9,44]. moreover, the transcriptional activity
of these coregulators has mainly been studied with
er␣, different results may be obtained with er␤
[45,46].
it should also be noted that coregulators activity
may be subject to several regulation pathways including phosphorylation and ubiquitin-proteasome degradation [47,48].
finally, there is evidence that src1 may activate
the erbb2 (her2) enhancer and that  xxxg1512xxx  may
enhance  xxxg366xxx  expression, suggesting that coregulators could establish cross-talk between nuclear
receptors and other molecular pathways; this may be
of importance in breast tumorigenesis [49,50].
altogether, estrogen signaling appears to be subject to numerous regulatory steps and cellular pathways
interplay.

3. er␣ coregulators and breast tumors
the current view of transcription regulation by
estrogen would tend to suggest that overexpression
of coactivator and/or downregulation of corepressor
would favor breast tumor growth.
genetic alterations of coregulator genes in primary
breast tumors were first described for the coactivator
 xxxg1512xxx  gene: dna amplification and mrna overexpression were found in 10% and 64% of cases, respectively
[51]. lower amplification frequencies were observed
by bautista et al. (4.8%) [52] and by iwase et al. (2
of 124 cases) [53].  xxxg1512xxx  mrna overexpression was
confirmed in two other studies [54,55]. with regards to
 xxxg1512xxx  isoform, overexpression of  xxxg1512xxx 3 (a variant
with exon 3 deletion) has also been described in breast
tumors [56].
in addition to quantitative variations in  xxxg1512xxx  expression, the cellular distribution of  xxxg1512xxx  may differ among
cells:  xxxg1512xxx  protein staining is generally cytoplasmic,
but nuclear staining was observed in 16% of 115 breast
cancer samples [53]. hudelist et al. [57] found  xxxg1512xxx 
protein expression in malignant epithelium only, suggesting that  xxxg1512xxx  is tumor-specific.
overexpression for sra,  xxxg1511xxx  and cbp in breast
tumors compared to normal breast tissue has also been
described [54,58]. in the case of sra, a variant with
exon 3 deletion was found to be linked with tumoral
grade [59].

i. girault et al. / maturitas 54 (2006) 342–351

conversely, downexpression of coactivators also
take place in breast tumorigenesis, which has been
described for ara70 and e6-ap [60,61].
in the case of corepressors, rea (repressor of er
activity) strong expression in breast tumors correlated
with slower cancer progression [62].
thus, wild type coregulators as well as tumorspecific variants may be of importance in breast tumorigenesis but also in other hormone-dependent malignancies such as prostate cancer [63,64].

4. er␣ coregulators and tamoxifen resistance
an imbalance in the expression of coactivator and
corepressor genes may impair tamoxifen activity either
by abolishing the antiestrogenic effect or by switching
the effect from antiestrogenic to estrogenic [65,66].
few coregulator genes have been studied as markers
of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients.
the first study, dealing with this issue, identified
high mrna levels (rt-pcr analysis) of the coactivator
src1 associated with favorable response to tamoxifen,
a finding which do not fit with the hypothesis of coactivator overexpression being associated with tamoxifen
enhanced estrogen activity [67]. it should be noted
that with the data provided in the study, the group of
breast tumors with high src1 expression associated
with favorable response also had significantly higher
level of er␣ compared to the group of unresponsive

347

patients. knowing that er␣ is the major predictive factor of tamoxifen treatment, predictive value of src1 for
tamoxifen response remains unclear.
recently, src1 expression (immunohistochemistry
analysis) was investigated in breast tumors (er␣
and/or pr-positive) according to her2 (erbb2) status (involved in the growth factor- xxxg2198xxx  pathway) from patients treated with chemotherapy and
tamoxifen. on multivariate analysis, src1 expression
was associated with disease recurrence only in the
subgroup of her2-positive breast tumors [68]. this
study support the hypothesis of src1 being involved in
tamoxifen resistance only in a specific subset of breast
tumors and underline the necessity to take into account
the expression status of previously identified tamoxifen
resistance marker like her2.
in chan et al. study [69], among tif1, sug1,
 xxxg1607xxx  and smrt, only sug1 showed lower expression (northern blot analysis) in resistant tumors. however, taking into account er␣ status, lower expression significancy in resistant tumors only persisted in
the er␣-negative tumors subgroup, demonstrating the
importance of er␣ status for conclusive results. this
study, therefore did not provide evidence for dysregulated expression of coregulator genes as a tamoxifen
resistance mechanism.
on the contrary, for the  xxxg1512xxx  coactivator in er␣positive tumors, two recent studies showed shorter
survival among tamoxifen treated patients with  xxxg1512xxx 
overexpression (western blot and rt-qpcr analysis,

fig. 3. comparative mrna levels of coregulator genes in breast tumors of patients who are sensitive (s = 66 patients) and resistant (r = 33
patients) to tamoxifen (mann–whitney test).

348

i. girault et al. / maturitas 54 (2006) 342–351

respectively), suggesting that tamoxifen activity may
be switched from antagonistic to agonistic. in addition,
in the study by iwase et al. [53], nuclear  xxxg1512xxx  staining (immunohistochemistry) tended to be associated
with favorable outcome in patients receiving endocrine
therapy, suggesting that not only the  xxxg1512xxx  expression
level but also its cellular distribution influence tamoxifen effectiveness.
for our part, we analyzed the mrna expression
(rt-qpcr) of three coactivator genes ( xxxg1512xxx ,  xxxg1511xxx ,
 xxxg1226xxx ) and two corepressor genes (ncor1 and
mta1l1) in a well-defined series of er␣-positive
breast cancer patients who exclusively received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy after surgery [70]. only
ncor1 was differentially expressed according to
relapse status, with significantly weaker expression in
patients who relapsed (fig. 3). ncor1 status also influenced outcome, weak expression being significantly
associated with shorter relapse-free survival in both the
log-rank test (univariate analysis) and the cox model
(multivariate analysis) (fig. 4). our results support the
view that ncor1 is required for full tamoxifen efficacy. this conclusion is supported by lavinsky et al.
[65] study, in which tamoxifen-resistant tumors, from a
nude mouse model, expressed lower levels of ncor1
than tamoxifen-sensitive tumors.
in our series, mrna expression of  xxxg1512xxx , the most
widely studied coregulator gene in breast cancer,
tended to be stronger in resistant than in sensitive
breast tumors (p = 0.11), but  xxxg1512xxx  status had no predictive value. the discrepancies with previous results
may be due to differences in treatment (tamoxifen plus

mrna levels (33 patients) and patients with intermediate and high
ncor1 mrna levels (66 patients) (log-rank test).

chemotherapy, instead of tamoxifen alone in our study),
to the analysis of  xxxg1512xxx  at the protein level instead
of the mrna level or to the representation of postmenopausal patients in study population [71,72]. it
is noteworthy that prediction of hormone responsiveness was further improved when expression of erbb2,
which is also associated with tamoxifen resistance, was
taken into account [4,6].
if coregulator gene expression is indeed to serve as
a molecular predictor of tamoxifen efficacy, prospective studies will be needed to show that this expression influences clinical outcome only in patients
who receive adjuvant tamoxifen and not in untreated
patients.

5. conclusion
to summarize, while published results, including
our own, suggest that some coregulator genes may be
involved in tamoxifen resistance, other possible factors
should not be overlooked. it is likely that individual
coregulator genes have a limited influence, but that
genes involved in several resistance pathways may have
clinical significance when considered together. cdnabased multigene analysis should be highly valuable to
further investigate the molecular basis of tamoxifen
resistance [53,73].
