 xxxd464xxx 

intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of somatostatin induces sustained, twisting posture followed by repetitive
lateral rotations along the longitudinal axis, termed barrel rotation
(br) (2, 4, 6). br has also been reported to be induced by
vasopressin (2,13), cholecystokinin (27-33) (16), bradykinin antagonists (20) and chlorpromazine-methiodide (5), an antimuscarinic agent. however, the neuroanatomical and pharmacological
basis for br remain to be determined. the decapeptide from the
frog,  xxxd464xxx  ( xxxd464xxx , cer), is chemically closely related to
the c-terminal octapeptide cholecystokinin (cck-8). like cck8, cer produces many behavioral effects in mammals: inhibition
of intake of food and water; antinociception; sedation; catalepsy;
ptosis; antistereotypic, anticonvulsive, and tremorolytic effects;
inhibition of self-stimulation (24). recently it has been reported
that cer and cck suppress tardlve dyskinesia in humans (19) and
in experimental animals (23). in the present study, we examined
the behavioral effect of sms 201-995 [ xxxd1793xxx -cys-phe-d-trplys-thr-cys-thr(ol)], a somatostatin analogue (3), and reported
that cer suppresses br evoked by sms 201-995.

described (1,12). on the day of experiment, the animals were
fasted for 2 hours. physiological saline, sms 201-995 (0.5, 5 ixg),
somatostatin (5, 50 p.g) or  xxxd3495xxx  (0.2, 1.0 p,g) were
injected icv in a volume of 10 ixl over a period of 60 seconds
through the catheter. the animals were pretreated with cer (1.6,
8, 40 txg/100 g b.wt.) intraperitoneally (ip) in a volume of 0.1
ml/100 g b.wt. 30 minutes, 3, 7 or 14 days prior to the injection

desulfated  xxxd464xxx  (40 p,g/100 g b.wt.) was administered ip 3

b.wt.), or vehicle (10% dmso in saline) was injected ip 20 min
before the administration of cer (40 p,g/100 g b.wt.). in another
experiment, cer (1.6 or 8 txg/10 ixl/rat),  xxxd247xxx  (30
ixg/rat) or hexamethonium bromide (40 i~g/rat) were administered
icv with sms 201-995 (5 p,g/rat). physostigmine sulfate (50
p~g/100 g b.wt.) or saline was administered ip 30 min before the
injection of sms 201-995 (5 ixg/rat) in animals pretreated with
cer (40 txg/100 g b.wt., ip, 3 day). the behavioral changes were
observed for 60 rain after the injection of sms 201-995. fisher's
exact probability test was used for the statistical analysis.
results

icv administration of somatostatin (5, 50 ~g/rat), sms
201-995 (5 p,g/rat) and  xxxd3495xxx  (0.2, 1 ixg/rat)
evoked br in rats (tables 1 and 2). the mean (+--se) number of
brs induced by sms 201-995 (5 ixg/rat) was 12 (___4). pretreatment of the animals with cer (40 p,g/100 g b.wt., ip) 3 days prior
to the injection of sms 201-995 significantly inhibited the
response of br induced by sms 201-995, but not that induced by
 xxxd3495xxx , as shown in fig. la and table 2. the
suppression of br by cer was evident 3 and 7 days after the
injection of cer (40 txg/100 g b.wt., ip). br induced by sms
201-995 was no longer suppressed after 14 days after the injection
of cer (fig. lb).
as shown in fig. 2, desulfated  xxxd464xxx  (ricer; 40 p~g/100 g
b.wt., ip) or mk-329, a selective peripheral cck ( xxxg352xxx )
receptor antagonist (400 ixg/100 g b.wt., ip), did not affect the br
induced by sms 201-995. however, mk-329 did partially antagonize the inhibition by cer of sms 201-995-induced br. the
icv administration of cer (1.6, 8 p,g/rat) with sms 201-995 did
not inhibit the response of br (fig. 2).
since somatostatin has been reported to increase acetylcholine
turnover in brain regions, we investigated the effect of cholinergic
drugs on sms 201-995-induced br in rats. figure 3 shows that

muscarinic cholinergic receptor-blocker, suppressed the br induced by sms 201-995 (5 ixg/rat), but hexamethonium (40 txg/
rat), a nicotinic receptor-blocker, did not suppress the br.
pretreatment of the animals with physostigmine sulfate (50 txg/
100 g b.wt., ip), a cholinesterase inhibitor, did not potentiate the
response of br induced by sms 201-995 nor antagonized the inhibition of cer on br.
discussion

the present study has demonstrated that sms 210-995 induced
br in a smaller dose than that of the "native" somatostatin.
since the icv administration of larger doses of somatostatin
caused lethal effects in rats [(2) and our unpublished observation], we preferred using a somatostatin analogue, sms 201-995,
at the dose of 5 p,g/rat, which was not lethal, in the following
experiments. sms 201-995 is more potent and less susceptible to
degradation than "native" somatostatin (3).
the present study has also demonstrated that the pretreatment
with cer inhibited the response rate of br induced by sms
201-995 in a dose-related manner. it has no effect on the br induced by  xxxd3495xxx , suggesting the selectivity of cer
on sms 201-995-induced br. pharmacological (7), electrophysiological (10) and binding (18) studies describe the existence of
two types of cck receptors: the peripheral-type cck ( xxxg352xxx )
receptor which recognizes sulfated cck-8 and is blocked by
mk-329 (7) and the hrain-type cck ( xxxg353xxx ) receptor which
also recognized smaller fragments of cck, such as cck-4. desulfated  xxxd464xxx , which had higher affinity to the  xxxg353xxx  receptor than to the  xxxg352xxx  (11,18), did not inhibit sms
201-995-induced br. mk-329 partially antagonized the inhibition by cer of sms 201-995-induced br. these findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of cer is mainly mediated through
the  xxxg352xxx  (22). the site of action of cer remains to
be determined. cns administration of cer at two doses did not
inhibit the br evoked by sms 201-995. cer has been shown to
have various cns effects that arise through vagal afferents (8,24).
it is possible, therefore, that cer is acting peripherally through
 xxxg352xxx  to inhibit the sms 201-995-induced br.
cns administration of atropine, but not hexamethonium, suppressed br induced by sms 201-995, which suggests that central muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms are involved in the sms
201-995-induced br (6). somatostatin has been shown to increase
acetylcholine turnover in the brain (15). cck-8 has also been
shown to modulate the release of acetylcholine from the cerebral cortex in a biphasic manner; acetylcholine release was

enhanced by smaller doses of cck-8, whereas larger doses of
cck-8 decreased acetylcholine turnover (14). we, therefore,
investigated whether the cholinergic mechanism might be involved
in the action of cer. however, the enhancement of endogenous
cholinergic tone by physostigmine neither enhanced the sms
201-995-induced br, nor modified the suppressive effect of cer
on br.
it is noteworthy that cer suppressed br induced by sms
201-995 for 7 days. the similar long-lasting effect of cer on the
central nervous system has previously been reported (17) following one single dose of either cck-8 or cer. 3h-spiperone

binding in both the striatum and the nucleus accumbens was
increased for a period up to two weeks (9) after combined
administration of cer with haloperidol. antagonism of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was observed for two weeks (17).
these findings are in good agreement with the clinical observation
by nishikawa et al. (19) of long-lasting effect of cer on tardive
dyskinesia. although the mechanism of long-lasting effect of cer
is unclear, sms 201-995-induced br may be a useful model for
studying the mechanisms by which cer inhibits human movement disorders.
