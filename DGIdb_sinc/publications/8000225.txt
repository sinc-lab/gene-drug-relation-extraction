[effects of gossypol acetate,  xxxd1806xxx , progesterone and gnrh-a on estrogen and progesterone receptors of human endometrial cells].  in order to evaluate the drugs in treating endometriosis, the direct effects of gossypol acetate,  xxxd1806xxx , progesterone, and gonadotropin releasing hormone-agonist (gnrh-a) on the isolated human endometrial cells were determined by dcc assay. the binding capacity of cytosolic  xxxg730xxx  (e2r) and  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) in groups treated with gossypol acetate or progesterone decreased. in  xxxd1806xxx -treated group, the binding capacity of pr decreased but not that of e2r. gnrh-a showed no significant effect on the binding capacity of e2r and pr. there was a significant linear correlation between the inhibitory rates of pr binding capacity of progesterone and  xxxd1806xxx . the results suggested that gossypol acetate,  xxxd1806xxx  and progesterone might have peripheral effects mediated by steroid receptors, while gnrh-a work clinically through the central path way only.
