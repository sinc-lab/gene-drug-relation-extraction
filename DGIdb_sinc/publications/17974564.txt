the gabaa3 receptor is a member of the cys-loop ligandgated ion channel family. each receptor has a pentameric structure, often comprising 2␣1, 2␤2, and a ␥2 subunit, although
many other subunit combinations are possible. gaba is the
major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult mammalian
brain, and it is therefore not surprising that its malfunction is
implicated in a number of disorders in which normal brain inhibition is disrupted, including epilepsy, insomnia, and anxietyrelated conditions. many drugs used to treat these disorders

target gabaa receptors, including anesthetics, barbiturates,
and benzodiazepines (1).
benzodiazepine agonists potentiate gabaa receptor-mediated gaba currents, whereas inverse agonists inhibit gaba
responses, and antagonists competitively block the action of
other benzodiazepines. diazepam is the prototypical benzodiazepine agonist and potentiates the gaba response by increasing the channel opening frequency of the receptor (1). more
recently, rusch and forman (2) used constitutively partially
open channels to show that the classical benzodiazepine agonists diazepam and midazolam, and an  xxxd1422xxx 
(fg7142), altered currents through the receptors in the absence
of gaba, supporting previous evidence that benzodiazepines
contribute directly to channel gating by altering the open-close
equilibrium of the receptor (3, 4). numerous binding studies
have shown that gaba can stimulate benzodiazepine binding
and that in turn benzodiazepines can alter gaba binding, confirming the allosteric links between gaba and benzodiazepine-binding sites (1), and recently benzodiazepine-induced
structural changes in the receptor have been identified (5).
however, while details of the residues involved in the benzodiazepine binding area have been identified (e.g. see ref. 6), the
molecular mechanism by which benzodiazepines mediate their
effects is not yet clear.
some of the machinery involved in coupling ligand binding
to channel gating in the cys-loop receptors is located at the
extracellular/transmembrane interface (7–11), and coupling of
benzodiazepine agonist binding to allosteric modulation also
appears to involve residues at this interface (12). the precise
regions of the protein that may be involved in this modulation,
however, remain unclear, although the flexible f-loop lies
within a few angstroms of both the binding site and the extracellular/transmembrane interface and is therefore a good candidate. to probe the role of the f-loop, here we explore the role
of six amino acids that constitute this loop in the ␥2 subunit; the
data show that these residues play an important role in coupling
binding of benzodiazepines to their allosteric effects.

gabaa receptors can be modulated by benzodiazepines,
although these compounds do not directly activate or inhibit the
receptors. the prototypic benzodiazepine, diazepam, potentiates responses to gaba in gabaa receptors that contain a ␥
subunit. here we have used mutagenesis, radioligand binding,
voltage clamp electrophysiology, and homology modeling to
probe the role of the f-loop residues asp192–arg197 in the
gabaa receptor ␥2 subunit in diazepam potentiation of the
gaba response. substitution of all of these residues with ala
and/or a residue with similar chemical properties to the wild
type residue decreased the level of diazepam potentiation, and
one mutation (d192a) resulted in its complete ablation. none of
the mutations changed the gaba ec50 or the [3h]flumazenil
binding affinity, suggesting they do not affect gaba or benzodiazepine binding characteristics; we therefore propose that
they are involved in the diazepam-mediated conformational
change that results in an increased response to gaba. homology models of the receptor binding pocket in agonist-bound and
unbound states suggest that the f-loop is flexible and has different orientations in the two states. considering our data in relation to these models, we find that the f-loop residues could contribute to hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic
interactions with neighboring residues that change during
receptor activation.

binding studies, cells in 90-mm dishes were transfected using
calcium phosphate precipitation at 80 –90% confluency and
routinely incubated for 3 days before use (13).
site-directed mutagenesis—mutagenesis reactions were performed using the method of kunkel (14) using human gabaa
receptor subunit dna (the kind gift of keith wafford, merck
sharp and dohme) in pcdna3.1 (invitrogen). oligonucleotide
primers were designed according to the recommendations of
sambrook et al. (15) and some suggestions of the primer generator (16). a silent restriction site was incorporated into each
primer to assist rapid identification.
radioligand binding—this was undertaken as described
previously in hek 293 cells, which provide an established and
robust method of studying ligand binding (17, 18). briefly,
transfected hek 293 cells were washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline and then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold hepes
buffer (10 mm, ph 7.4) with proteinase inhibitors and frozen at
⫺20 °c. after thawing, they were washed twice with hepes
buffer and resuspended, and 50 ␮g of cell membranes was incubated in 0.5 ml of hepes buffer containing the benzodiazepine
antagonist [3h]flumazenil. saturation binding (eight point)
assays were performed on at least three separate plates of transfected cells for each mutant using 0.1– 40 nm [3h]flumazenil.
nonspecific binding was determined using 1 ␮m diazepam.
reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °c and terminated by
rapid vacuum filtration using a brandel cell harvester onto
gf/b filters pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine followed
by two rapid washes with 4 ml of ice-cold hepes buffer.
radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting
(beckman ls6000sc). protein concentration was estimated

xenopus oocyte isolation and mrna injection—harvested
stage v–vi xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared as described
previously. oocytes, which are well suited to the study of
ligand-gated ion channels, especially those constituted from
multiple subunits, were injected with 1:1:10 ␣:␤:␥ mrna,
generated by in vitro transcription using the mmessage
mmachine kit (ambion) from dna subcloned into pgemhe
(19). oocytes were maintained in nd96 buffer (96 mm nacl, 2 mm
kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5 mm hepes, ph 7.5) containing  xxxd2193xxx  (0.1 mg/ml), theophylline (0.12 mg/ml),
and tetracycline (50 ␮g/ml). electrophysiological measurements were routinely performed ⬃48 h post-injection, which
yielded optimal diazepam potentiation.
electrophysiology—using a two electrode voltage clamp,
xenopus oocytes were routinely clamped at ⫺60 mv using an
oc-725 amplifier (warner instruments), and currents were
digitized by the digitizer132a interface (axon instruments).

replacement of arg197 with either ala or lys reduced the
maximal diazepam potentiation to ⬃30% that of wild type (fig.
2f). diazepam enhancement curves were very similar for both
these mutant receptors, indicating that a positive charge is not
critical here, and that arg has a specific interaction that cannot
be replaced by a residue with similar chemical properties.
molecular modeling—homology modeling and ligand docking in cys-loop receptors is being increasingly used to predict
molecular interactions, but as there are as yet no high resolution structures of any complete cys-loop receptors, the data
obtained must be viewed with caution. this is particularly
important for the f-loop region, which is largely flexible, making it difficult to assign residue locations with certainty, even in
the different achbps whose structures have been resolved to
atomic resolution. such studies, however, can lead to useful
testable hypotheses, and thus, as long as the limitations of such
studies are appreciated, they can be extremely useful. here
f-loop modeling studies, using both agonist-free and agonistbound aplysia achbp as templates, suggested some interesting potential interactions of some of the f-loop residues: trp196
may act as a pin to restrict local protein movement in a hydrophobic region, while asp192, thr193, arg194, thr195, and arg197
may contribute to hydrogen bonding networks that differ in the
bound and unbound states (fig. 3).

discussed in more detail below. none of the mutations changed
[3h]flumazenil binding affinity, suggesting they do not have a significant impact on benzodiazepine binding characteristics; we
therefore propose that they are primarily involved in the conformational change that results in an increased gaba-mediated
response. homology models of the receptor binding pocket in agonist-bound and unbound states suggest that the f-loop is flexible,
and that there are some differences in residue orientations in the
two states. considering our data in relation to these models show
that the f-loop residues could contribute to hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic interactions with neighboring residues
that may change during receptor activation.
asp192 contributes to a hydrogen bond network—the data
suggest a very specific role for asp192 in diazepam modulation of
the gabaa receptor. mutation of asp192 to ala completely abolished diazepam enhancement of gaba currents, and replacement with the chemically similar glu reduced receptor responsiveness to diazepam by 40%. however, replacement by asn
resulted in receptors that were similar to wild type. these data
suggest that a negative charge is not required at this position for
maximal potentiation but that size and/or hydrogen bonding ability are critical. examination of the models reveal a possible explanation for these data, hydrogen bonds that contribute to a hydrogen bonding network. the unbound model shows the carboxylate
side chain of asp192 has the potential to form two hydrogen bonds,
one with asn208 and the other with thr209 (fig 3a, panel i).
replacement of asp192 with glu would extend the length of the
side chain, which would allow only one of these hydrogen bonds to
form (fig 3a, panel ii), whereas replacement with asn could
replace both (fig 3a, panel iii) and ala neither (fig 3a, panel iv). in
the bound form asp192 is in a different orientation, facing the subunit interface. however it still has the potential to hydrogen bond
here, this time with val190 (data not shown). we suggest that these
networks of hydrogen bonds are critical for benzodiazepine potentiation, and that their partial or complete removal compromises
the response of the receptor to diazepam.
an aspartate residue may be important in the f-loop of all cysloop receptors. ligand binding and/or function is disrupted by
mutations to asp residues in the f-loop of nicotinic ach␥
(asp203), ␦ (asp208), and ⑀ (asp202) receptor subunits, and gabaa
␣1 (asp183) and  xxxg1116xxx  (asp204) receptor subunits (21, 25, 26).
these residues may have equivalent roles to asp192, although both
clustal and fugue alignments of complete receptor subunits
suggest they are not in equivalent locations. this may, however, be
due to poor alignment of the f-loop region due to poor conservation here. a clustal alignment of the f-loop region alone supports
this hypothesis by aligning these asp residues (fig. 4a).
trp196 makes a hydrophobic contribution to diazepam
potentiation—hydrophobicity appears important at position
196. phe, which has similar hydrophobicity to trp, does not
change the maximum potentiation. ala, which is less hydrophobic and less bulky, also performs reasonably well at this
location (⬃50% of wt potentiation), although surprisingly tyr
does not; it yields a maximal potentiation of only 20% of a wild
type. however, tyr is a polar residue; it is reasonably acidic and
it can hydrogen bond; thus it appears that one or more of these
characteristics is detrimental to receptor function.

model, however, reveals that trp196
is located in a groove in the neighboring ␣ subunit, where it could
participate in both hydrophobic and
hydrogen bond interactions (fig.
3b). thus trp 196 could as a pin to
restrict the movement of this end of
the loop, and perhaps may even
serve as a rigid pivot point. either or
both of these possibilities would
mean that replacement with a residue that has different chemical
properties could be distinctly
unfavorable.
other f loop residues—data
from mutations of the other f-loop
residues suggest specific interactions of arg194 and arg197, as
replacement of both with the chemically similar lys reveal similar
decreases in the levels of diazepam
potentiation, although ala can efficiently replace arg194 indicating a
small residue is well tolerated here.
the bound model reveals that these
two arginines may form part of a
critical hydrogen bond network
required for effective f-loop function (fig. 3c). arg197 appears to be
central to this network, with the
potential to contribute up to five
hydrogen bonds to thr193, arg194,
and tyr199. an alanine substitution
at position 194 would be well tolerated as the hydrogen bond involves
the backbone carbonyl, although
substitution with a more bulky residue such as lysine could disrupt the
backbone architecture. similarly
substitution of arg197 would significantly disrupt the hydrogen bond
network, and as our results show,
neither lys nor ala mutations are
well tolerated here. interestingly,

to undergo structural rearrangements that result in or occur during
channel gating. there is support for
this hypothesis from other cys-loop
receptors; pentobarbital activation of gabaa receptors resulted
in methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium modification of cys residues substituted for val180 (aligns
with asp192) and ala181 (thr193) in
the ␣1 gabaa receptor subunit,
suggesting that these regions
undergo structural changes (exposing the residues to chemical modification) during ligand binding
and/or channel gating (12), and
movement in two regions of the
f-loop has also been reported to
occur in the  xxxg1116xxx  (21).
this conservation of f-loop flexibility, combined with its critical role in
cys-loop receptor function, and at
least one conserved residue (asp),
would not be inconsistent with
there being a similar structure for all
f-loops; however, current techniques preclude testing such a
hypothesis.
interestingly our data suggest the
f-loop needs to be precisely positioned in both bound and unbound
versions of the receptor for efficient
enhancement of gaba-mediated
responses. if, as previously discussed,

architecture and/or function (2, 12,
