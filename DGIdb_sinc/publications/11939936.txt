objectives – to determine the efficacy and safety of the catechol-omethyltransferase (comt) inhibitor  xxxd2000xxx , used as an adjunct to
levodopa, in parkinson’s disease (pd) patients. patients and methods –
in this parallel group, randomized, double-blind study, 301 pd
patients, the majority with motor fluctuations, received  xxxd2000xxx 
(200 mg) or placebo with each daily dose of standard or controlledrelease (cr) levodopa. the 24-week treatment period was followed by
2 weeks of  xxxd2000xxx  withdrawal. efficacy was determined by home
diaries (‘on’ and ‘off’ times), unified parkinson’s disease rating scale
(updrs) and changes in levodopa dosage, and safety by adverseevent inquiry, vital signs, electro cardiography (ecg) and laboratory
tests. results – in the total population, the updrs activities of daily
living and motor scores were significantly improved (p < 0.05) by
 xxxd2000xxx  vs placebo. in fluctuating patients, ‘on’ time increased
(1.7 h) and ‘off’ time decreased (1.5 h) significantly more with
 xxxd2000xxx  than with placebo (0.5 and 0.6 h, respectively; p < 0.05),
and the daily levodopa dose was reduced by 54 mg with  xxxd2000xxx 
and increased by 27 mg with placebo (p < 0.05).  xxxd2000xxx  benefit
was lost on withdrawal.  xxxd2000xxx  efficacy was comparable between
patients using cr and standard levodopa preparations. increased
dyskinesias ( xxxd2000xxx  34%, placebo 26%) and nausea (10 and 5%,
respectively), mostly occurring shortly after treatment initiation, were
generally managed by reducing the levodopa dose. diarrhoea
( xxxd2000xxx  8%, placebo 4%) was seldom severe. there were no
differences in vital signs, ecg or laboratory results. conclusion –
 xxxd2000xxx  is an effective and safe levodopa extender and enhancer,
improving the symptomatic efficacy of levodopa in pd and adding to
the patients’ benefit.

despite the superior efficacy of levodopa therapy
in parkinson’s disease (pd), its long-term use is
associated with motor complications, such as endof-dose wearing-off and dyskinesias (1–3). the
management of motor fluctuations is often difficult

poewe et al.
 xxxg487xxx  (comt) inhibition offers a novel, unique mechanism of action by
inhibiting the o-methylation of levodopa (5, 6).
 xxxd2000xxx  is a highly potent and specific
peripherally acting comt inhibitor with a nitrocatechol structure (7).  xxxd2000xxx  is used as an
adjunct to levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  (ddc)
inhibitor therapy as it does not have an antiparkinsonian activity of its own. when administered
concomitantly with levodopa,  xxxd2000xxx  increases
the area under the curve (auc) of levodopa by
reducing its metabolism to an inactive metabolite,
3-o-methyldopa (3-omd).  xxxd2000xxx  neither
affects the peak levodopa concentration (cmax) nor
the time to reach the peak concentration (tmax) (8).
the clinical effect of comt inhibition is mainly
seen as a prolongation of the effect of each single
dose of levodopa (9–11). the daily ‘on’ time is
increased and ‘off’ time reduced with repeated
dosing of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with end-of-dose
motor fluctuations (12, 13).
the present trial was an efficacy and safety study
in pd patients who were considered in need of an
enhanced levodopa response. in the earlier clinical
studies (9–13) only fluctuating patients were
recruited. in this study, to obtain more experience
on the use of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with less
advanced disease, patients without obvious motor
fluctuations were also eligible. in addition, the use
of other antiparkinsonian drugs was freely allowed
to follow the current clinical practice as much as
possible.

patients and methods
patients

a total of 301 patients with pd were entered into
the study from 30 centres in germany and
austria. the inclusion criteria were: levodoparesponsive patients with idiopathic pd who
needed an enhancement and/or smoothening of
levodopa effects; age between 30 and 80 years; use
of 2–10 daily doses of standard and/or cr
levodopa preparations; and stable levodopa treatment for at least 1 month before entering the
study. both levodopa/ xxxd2471xxx /
benserazide preparations were allowed. patients
treated with amantadine or memantine, anticholinergics, selegiline, or dopamine agonists in addition to levodopa treatment were also eligible.
exclusion criteria were treatment with neuroleptics, neuroleptic antiemetics, catechol-structured
drugs, monoamine oxidase (mao)-a inhibitors
or non-selective mao inhibitors. patients with
other major neurological, psychiatric or medical
246

disorders were excluded. patients with end-of-dose
motor fluctuations were identified by their clinical
history and home-diary evaluation at baseline,
and defined as those with significant ‘off’ time
(minimum 4.5 h over three home-diary days and
at least 0.5 h every day). patients with no or mild
fluctuations (termed ‘non-fluctuators’ in this
paper) had less than 4.5 h of ‘off’ time over
three home-diary days. the patients were given
oral and written information, gave their written
consent to participate in the trial. all relevant
ethics committees approved the study protocol
according to national regulations. the study also
followed the guidelines of the amended declaration of helsinki.
study design

the study was a parallel group, randomized,
double-blind trial. the duration of the trial was
approximately 7 months (28–30 weeks), and comprised a screening visit (2–4 weeks before the
baseline visit), five study visits (a baseline visit
followed by visits at 2, 6, 16, and 24 weeks), and a
post-study visit (about 2 weeks after withdrawal of
the study medication).
at the baseline visit, patients were randomized to
receive either  xxxd2000xxx  or placebo in a ratio of two
to one. the computer-generated randomization
procedure was performed separately for each
centre. only the sponsor-employed person who
generated the plan was aware of a given individual’s
assignment during the study. the randomization
envelopes were printed in quadruplicate: one for the
investigator, one for the monitor, one for the clinical
research manager of the sponsor, and one for the
safety monitoring committee. there was no
instance that required unblinding of the assignment
during the study medication period although, later,
during a post-study visit, one of the investigators
had to open one envelope because the patient had
diarrhoea and his family doctor insisted on knowing
the medication. the independent safety monitoring
committee consisted of three members and was
established solely for the study. the committee was
provided with all serious adverse event (sae)
reports, adverse event (ae) reports and laboratory
safety data coded as treatment a or b, and met twice
during the study. the committee identified no safety
concerns and had no reason to either break the code
or terminate the study prematurely.
treatment

the dosages of each patient’s medication (both
levodopa and other antiparkinsonian drugs) had

efficacy and safety of  xxxd2000xxx  in parkinson’s disease patients
had to remain unchanged for at least 4 weeks
before randomization.  xxxd2000xxx  200 mg (orion
pharma, espoo, finland) or a matching placebo
was given concomitantly with each daily dose of
standard and/or cr levodopa (ranging from 2 to
10 doses daily, depending on each patient’s levodopa dosing frequency). the levodopa dosage could
be adjusted individually by changing primarily the
levodopa dose or secondarily the dosing interval
when clinically indicated, for example, because of
dopaminergic aes such as increased dyskinesias.
however, the levodopa dosage between weeks 16
and 24 was to be kept stable as far as was clinically
possible.
assessments

the total unified parkinson’s disease rating scale
(updrs) (14) during ‘on’ periods was recorded at
each study visit (1–2 h after intake of levodopa).
the total daily scheduled levodopa doses, number
of daily doses and possible changes in other
antiparkinsonian medication were also recorded
at each visit. patients kept a home diary for 3 days
before each study visit (except the withdrawal
visit), and kept a record of whether they were ‘on’,
‘off’, or ‘asleep’ at 30-min intervals over each 24-h
period. ‘on’ time was defined as a period when the
patient was mobile or capable of moving with
relative ease and independence. ‘off’ time was
defined as a period when the patient was immobile
or incapable of moving with relative ease and
independence. the patients were trained to fill in
the home diaries under guidance at the screening
visit. in addition, fluctuating patients kept a diary
record of the amount of levodopa they used each
day. compliance was monitored by counting the
unused tablets at weeks 6, 16 and 24. safety
assessments included an ae inquiry, blood pressure and heart rate measurements (at both supine
and standing positions), electrocardiography
(ecg), blood samples for laboratory evaluation
(haematology, chemistry) and urinanalysis at all
visits. a central laboratory (interlab, heidelberg,
germany) analysed the laboratory tests. possible
drug interactions were to be reported according to
the investigator’s clinical judgement.
outcome measures

the primary efficacy variable for fluctuating
patients was the proportion of daily ‘on’ time
while awake. in addition, the absolute ‘on’ and
‘off’ times in hours were evaluated as secondary
variables. other efficacy variables (updrs scores,
daily scheduled levodopa dose, dosing frequency)

were evaluated separately for the total population,
fluctuating and non-fluctuating patients. in addition, daily levodopa dose and dosing frequency
from home diaries were evaluated for fluctuating
patients.
measurements of safety included the frequency
and severity of aes, abnormal laboratory test and
ecg results, and orthostatic hypotension (supine
minus
standing
systolic
blood
pressure
>30 mmhg). items 32–35 of the updrs were
also used to evaluate the occurrence and severity of
dyskinesias. differences between treatment groups
and changes from baseline to week 24 in laboratory
tests and vital signs were evaluated. the potential
relationship between dose levels of study medication or other antiparkinsonian medication and the
frequency of aes was also evaluated.
sample size

initially, 400 patients were planned to be recruited
into this study as part of a risk/benefit evaluation
of long-term use of  xxxd2000xxx , and no formal
sample-size calculation was performed. in spite of
extending the recruitment period several times, the
intended sample size was not achieved, especially
the number of non-fluctuating patients was small.
the sponsor re-evaluated the number of patients
before opening the treatment code and considered
301 patients to be adequate for long-term safety
evaluation purposes and to assess efficacy in
fluctuating patients. to show a difference of 1 h
in mean daily ‘on’ time, approximately 280
(187 + 93) patients would be needed (standard
deviation of 2.8 h, two-way significance level of
5% and a power of 80%). this is approximately
the number of fluctuating patients recruited.
statistical analysis

the statistical analyses were performed according
to the intention-to-treat (itt) principle. analysis
for safety measures included all randomized
patients who had taken at least one dose of study
medication. efficacy analysis included all patients
who had been randomized, received at least one
dose of study medication, and subsequently studied
at least once. both ‘observed case’ (oc) and ‘last
observation carried forward’ (locf) types of itt
analyses were performed. the reason for reporting
oc rather than locf analysis results in this
report is the potential bias of the latter because of
the considerable number of missing recordings or
non-evaluable data in home diary (15% for
 xxxd2000xxx  and 12% for placebo group) and
updrs (13% for  xxxd2000xxx  and 10% for
247

poewe et al.
placebo group) and the rather different discontinuation rates between the groups (24% for  xxxd2000xxx  and 14% for placebo group) (15).
the continuous variables [proportion of ‘on’
time and ‘off’ time, updrs score (total and parts
i, ii, and iii), daily levodopa dose and dosing
frequency, and haemodynamic and laboratory
variables] were analysed at week 24 using analysis
of covariance (ancova). the model included
terms for treatment, centre, and treatment-bycentre interaction, and the baseline measurement
as a covariate. centre and treatment-by-centre
interaction were used as random factors. different
sets of patients (total population, fluctuating
patients, fluctuating patients with 5–10 levodopa
doses and non-fluctuating patients) were analysed
separately. the differences between treatments at
week 24, p-values and 95% confidence intervals
(ci) were computed using mixed procedure of
sas. to evaluate the effects of withdrawal,
ancova with repeated measures was used. the
time points in the model were week 24 and poststudy visit, and the baseline measurement was used
as a covariate. to analyse the treatment effect of
 xxxd2000xxx  in cr levodopa users, patients were
classified into two groups: those who used more
than one cr levodopa preparation a day (either a
combination of cr and standard levodopa or cr
levodopa only) and those who used only standard
levodopa preparations. patients using only one cr
tablet, mainly in the evening, were not included in
the analysis. furthermore, the group and groupby-treatment interaction factors were added to the
original ancova model to statistically analyse
the interaction.
differences in the frequency of aes were tested
by the chi-squared test or fisher’s exact test. for
baseline comparisons, the chi-squared test or the
mann–whitney u-test was used. for other variables, the analyses were descriptive. a two-way
significance level of 5% was considered to be
statistically significant.

results
patient characteristics

the patients’ demographic data are presented in
table 1. there were no significant differences in
either demographic or clinical characteristics
between treatment groups at baseline, except that
the duration of pd was about 1 year longer in the
placebo than in the  xxxd2000xxx  group (p < 0.05).
this difference should have no clinical significance.

had no fluctuations. of all 301 patients, 136 took
only standard levodopa preparations. twenty
patients used only cr levodopa preparations
whereas 145 patients took a combination of cr
and standard levodopa preparations. of these 145
patients, 67 took only one cr tablet a day, mostly
in the evening, and 78 patients took more than one
tablet daily (two to nine tablets), the majority of
whom took three to four cr doses daily. more than
90% of the patients used also other antiparkinsonian medication (table 1). no relevant changes in
this medication regimen occurred during the study.
overall compliance, as measured by tablet
counts, averaged 98% in both treatment groups.
of the entire study population, 76% in the
 xxxd2000xxx  and 86% in the placebo group completed the study (fig. 1). the main reasons for
premature withdrawal were aes in both treatment
groups (see ‘discontinuations’ below). other premature withdrawals were because of a variety of
reasons, including non-compliance, withdrawn
consent, protocol violations and lost to follow-up.
no deaths occurred during the study.

six-month treatment with  xxxd2000xxx  significantly
improved the activities of daily living (adl) score
from 12.4 at baseline to 11.1 at week 24 while a

essentially unchanged in both treatment groups

the proportion of daily ‘on’ time increased from
62 to 72% with  xxxd2000xxx  and from 59 to 65%
with placebo, and the difference between the groups
was significant (p < 0.05; table 2 and fig. 3). the
average ‘on’ time increased from 10.0 h at baseline
to 11.7 h at the end of the study in patients treated
with  xxxd2000xxx  compared with an increase from
9.7 to 10.7 h in patients treated with placebo. the
difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
conversely, the ‘off’ time decreased significantly
more after  xxxd2000xxx  than after placebo
(p < 0.05) (table 2; fig. 3). a subanalysis in
fluctuating patients treated with 5–10 levodopa

decreased by average 39 mg in the  xxxd2000xxx  group
and by 3 mg in the placebo group (not significant).
altogether 50 patients (33%) had a decrease in their
daily levodopa dose in the  xxxd2000xxx  group and 15
(17%) in the placebo group. the average daily
levodopa dose used by the patients, as reported in
their home diaries, was reduced by 54 mg with
 xxxd2000xxx  compared with an increase of 27 mg
with placebo (p < 0.05, table 2). no significant
differences were observed in scheduled or home

standard levodopa preparation and in those taking
more than one daily cr levodopa dose in the
 xxxd2000xxx  group. also, the adl and motor
scores of the updrs improved to a similar extent
in both these groups. to test for possible statistical
differences between these two patient groups, cr
levodopa and non-cr levodopa users, the interaction term ‘treatment · group’ was analysed. it
was non-significant for all efficacy parameters,
indicating that  xxxd2000xxx  had a beneficial effect
independent of the type of levodopa preparation
used. the scheduled daily levodopa dose at baseline was, on average, 700 mg in the patients using
more than one cr levodopa dose daily compared
with 460 mg in those using standard levodopa
preparations only. with  xxxd2000xxx  treatment,
the scheduled levodopa dose was decreased by
53  137 mg in the cr levodopa group and by
31  94 mg in the standard levodopa group.
with placebo the scheduled levodopa dose was
decreased by 27  420 mg in cr group and
increased by 8  122 mg in standard levodopa
group.

the updrs scores and daily levodopa dose were
evaluated in patients without clear motor fluctuations.  xxxd2000xxx  decreased, i.e. improved adl
scores from 11.3 to 10.3 points, and motor scores
from 28.0 to 25.7 points. a worsening of disability
occurred in the placebo group, with changes from
9.8 to 11.3 (adl) and from 24.8 to 26.9 (motor).
however, the differences between the groups were
not statistically significant because of the small
sample size (25 patients for  xxxd2000xxx  and 16 for
placebo). the baseline scheduled daily levodopa
dose was 444 mg with  xxxd2000xxx  and 455 mg with
placebo. the dosage was decreased by 24  75 mg
in the  xxxd2000xxx  group compared with an
increase of 2  75 mg with placebo.
effect of withdrawal in the total patient population

the benefit gained with  xxxd2000xxx  in adl and
motor scores was consistently lost when the drug
was withdrawn whereas there were virtually no
changes in the placebo group (fig. 2b and table 4).
following withdrawal of  xxxd2000xxx , the scheduled
daily levodopa dose was increased to nearly its
baseline value compared with only a 5-mg increase
with placebo group (p < 0.05 between treatments).
the more frequent occurrence of hypokinesia
and aggravation of parkinsonism in patients withdrawn from  xxxd2000xxx  compared with placebo
(p < 0.001) may equally be viewed as an indicator
of loss of  xxxd2000xxx  efficacy.

approximately 86% of the  xxxd2000xxx  patients
and 74% of the placebo patients reported aes
during the study. most events were considered mild
or moderate, and only about 10% were severe in
both groups. new or worsening of pre-existing
dopaminergic aes, such as dyskinesias and nausea,
were the most commonly reported and were more
frequent with  xxxd2000xxx  than with placebo
(table 5).
the majority of dyskinesias occurred shortly
after initiation of  xxxd2000xxx  treatment – 60% were
recorded at 2 weeks and a further 20% at 6 weeks.
in most cases, the dyskinesias subsided when the
levodopa dose was reduced. thereafter, their frequency was the same as, or even smaller, than with
placebo. in the  xxxd2000xxx  group, 57% of the
patients reported having dyskinesias at baseline as
well as at the end of the study treatment. the
corresponding figures in the placebo group were
64% at baseline and 63% at the study end.
furthermore, based on updrs item 32, the proportional duration of dyskinesias increased slightly
on the second visit (at 2 weeks), then returned to
baseline values in the  xxxd2000xxx  group. the
proportion of patients reporting severely or completely disabling dyskinesias decreased from 12 to

early morning dystonias (updrs item 34) at
baseline were similar in patients taking  xxxd2000xxx 
(40%) compared with placebo. no marked changes
in these figures occurred during the study.
as with the dyskinesias, nausea occurred mainly
after initiation of  xxxd2000xxx  treatment, with 70%
being reported at the first study visit. thereafter, its
frequency did not differ between treatment groups.
analysis of updrs item 40 (anorexia, nausea,
vomiting) showed a transient increase at baseline
of 5% among the  xxxd2000xxx -treated patients,
rising to 12% at the week 2 visit before returning to
baseline values. no changes were observed in the
placebo group.
almost all cases of diarrhoea (8% with  xxxd2000xxx , 4% with placebo, table 5) were reported
within 4 months of  xxxd2000xxx  initiation, but did
not occur shortly after starting  xxxd2000xxx . the
occurrence of diarrhoea was apparently not doserelated.

safety in subgroups

discontinuations caused by adverse events

the use of selegiline did not influence the frequency
of aes in either treatment group. in patients
taking dopamine agonists, moderately more dyskinesias were reported compared with those not
using them (in the  xxxd2000xxx  group, 43% of the
patients treated with dopamine agonists compared
with 20% of those who were not; in the placebo
group, 30 and 11%, respectively). in the  xxxd2000xxx  group, the incidence of any aes did not
substantially differ between patients using cr and
those using standard levodopa preparations (88%
vs 85%, respectively).

treatment-induced discontinuations were recorded
in 41 patients (21%) in the  xxxd2000xxx  group and
in 10 patients (10%) in the placebo group. the
most common reasons for discontinuation in the
 xxxd2000xxx  group were related to the increased
dopaminergic effect, such as nausea (seven cases),
hallucinations (four cases) and dyskinesias (three
cases), most probably because of the enhancement
of levodopa. the levodopa dose was reduced
mainly because of dyskinesias and nausea in 30%
of the patients taking  xxxd2000xxx  who completed
the study (with a mean levodopa dose reduction of
159 mg). among patients who discontinued the
study, mostly because of dopaminergic events, the
levodopa dose reduction was only 38 mg. only one
patient treated with  xxxd2000xxx  discontinued the
study because of diarrhoea. no patient discontinued because of elevated liver enzyme values.
aggravation of parkinsonian symptoms and
hypokinesia (six cases) were the most common
reasons for discontinuation in the placebo group.

vital signs and ecg

there were no clinically significant differences
between the  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo groups
in vital signs or ecg. five patients taking
 xxxd2000xxx  (3%) and two (2%) taking placebo
reported orthostatism as an ae during the study.
the proportion of patients with orthostatic
hypotension (>30 mmhg decrease from supine
to standing positions) increased from 4% (8/197)
at baseline to only 5% (8/147) in the  xxxd2000xxx 
group at the end of the study and from 2%
(2/104) to 5% (4/89) in the placebo group. these
changes were not statistically significant. the
incidence of newly occurring ecg changes
was similar in both groups. the investigators
did not report any clinically significant drug
interactions.
laboratory analysis

no statistically significant or clinically meaningful
changes were seen in any of the laboratory safety
tests in either of the treatment groups. no cases of
hepatitis or discontinuations as a result of pathological liver values were observed. elevated values
in liver function tests were occasionally observed
during the study with approximately the same
frequency in both groups. after introduction of
study treatment 17 (9%) patients in the  xxxd2000xxx 
group and six patients (6%) in the placebo group
with normal values at baseline had s-alanine
transaminase (alt) values elevated beyond the
reference range, for s-aspartate transaminase
(ast) the respective figures were 7 (4%) and 5
(5%). however, only one patient in each treatment
group ( xxxd2000xxx  0.5%, placebo 1.0%) showed
an increase of marginally more than three times the
upper reference limit, regarded as potentially
clinically significant, but only at one visit in each
case.

discussion

the present 6-month trial investigated the efficacy
and safety of  xxxd2000xxx  as an adjunct to levodopa
in pd patients who were considered to benefit
of an enhancement in their levodopa response,
whether using standard or cr preparations. the
patient population were mostly fluctuating
patients, but – different from previous studies (12,
13) – included some non-fluctuating patients as
well. patients were allowed to use dopamine
agonists, selegiline, amantadine and anticholinergics, and the percentages of patients using concomitant multiple antiparkinsonian agents were
higher than in previous trials (12, 13). thus, the
treatment of pd in this trial resembled current
clinical practice (16) where patients are commonly
treated with a combination of several antiparkinsonian drugs.
when  xxxd2000xxx  was added to this ‘optimized’
antiparkinsonian medication, the motor score of
the updrs was still reduced by more than three
points in the  xxxd2000xxx  group compared with
virtually no changes in the placebo group both in
the total patient population and in the fluctuating
patients. the differences were statistically significant in both cases. although it is commonly held
that fluctuating pd patients will not experience
further improvement of ‘on’ motor function when
smoothing out fluctuations, this and previous
studies (12, 13) with  xxxd2000xxx  have revealed
additional gains in updrs ‘on’ scores. the adl

efficacy and safety of  xxxd2000xxx  in parkinson’s disease patients
score also improved significantly with  xxxd2000xxx 
compared with placebo in both the total population and in patients with fluctuations. the adl
score is an important indicator of quality of life
as it correlates with other quality-of-life parameters (17). these results are in good accordance
with the results of previous studies (12, 13)
indicating that levodopa enhancement through
comt inhibition also improves ‘on’-time motor
function.
in patients with motor fluctuations, ‘on’ time
was increased by almost 1 h per day and ‘off’ time
reduced correspondingly in patients taking  xxxd2000xxx  compared with placebo. the increase in
‘on’ time was even more evident in fluctuating
patients with 5–10 daily levodopa doses being
1.2 h with  xxxd2000xxx  compared with placebo.
this corresponds very well with the findings in a
comparable population in a previous study (13).
the average daily levodopa dose in fluctuating
patients, as recorded in home diaries, was reduced
by approximately 54 mg with  xxxd2000xxx  and
increased by approximately 27 mg with placebo
during the 6-month study. the results accord well
with those of the previous  xxxd2000xxx  studies
(11–13).
so far the action of  xxxd2000xxx  when used with
cr levodopa preparations has only been evaluated
in single dose and short-term studies (18, 19).
 xxxd2000xxx  increases the auc of levodopa with
cr levodopa preparations as with standard levodopa preparations, but may also increase the
cmax.  xxxd2000xxx  has been shown to extend the
clinical effect of cr levodopa in single doses
approximately as much as with standard levodopa
preparations (18, 19). however, the long-term
clinical studies of  xxxd2000xxx  reported so far
have only allowed the use of standard levodopa
preparations (12, 13). this is the first phase iii
study where  xxxd2000xxx  has been used as an
adjunct to both standard and controlled release
levodopa preparations. the present group of
patients using cr levodopa preparations was
relatively heterogeneous; the majority took three
to four cr tablets a day in addition to standard
levodopa. separate analysis of the patients using
cr preparations and those not using them showed
comparable improvements in ‘on’ and ‘off’ times
with  xxxd2000xxx  based on home-diary data. this
finding confirms the results of single dose challenge
tests (18, 19), that  xxxd2000xxx  prolongs the effect
of cr and standard levodopa preparations to a
similar degree.
although the group of non-fluctuating patients
in this trial turned out to be small precluding
adequate statistical analysis, the observed trends

for reduced levodopa requirements and improved
motor function support the potential of comt
inhibition to enhance levodopa efficacy also in
stable responders (20).
the development of l-dopa induced motor
complications is believed to be the result of
intermittent pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors that is characteristic of multiple
dose standard levodopa therapy (21). enhancing
levodopa efficacy through comt inhibition, on
the other hand, is associated with prolonged halflife of individual levodopa doses thereby providing
more continuous dopaminergic tone. therefore,
adding a comt inhibitor might be the preferable
strategy to improve levodopa efficacy in patients
without motor fluctuations compared with increases in dose size and/or frequency of standard
levodopa.
the ae profile of  xxxd2000xxx  in this study was
comparable with that of previous studies (12, 13, 22)
and no unexpected aes were reported. dopaminergic aes, such as dyskinesias and nausea, were
the most frequently reported, occurring nearly
twice as often with  xxxd2000xxx  than with placebo.
dopaminergic aes were seldom severe and were
dealt with, in most cases, by reducing the levodopa
dose. dyskinesias seldom appeared in patients
without pre-existing dyskinesias at baseline. typically, the increases in pre-existing dyskinesias were
related to prolonged duration, whereas their
severity was not enhanced, which is consistent
with previous experience (10, 11). the worsening of
dyskinesias occurred early after initiation of  xxxd2000xxx , but were usually responsive to levodopa
dose reductions, so that the percentages of patients
with dyskinesias did not differ between baseline and
the end of the study. dopaminergic aes were not
significantly different between standard and cr
levodopa users, indicating that  xxxd2000xxx  can also
safely be used with cr levodopa preparations.
the discontinuation rate was slightly higher in
the present study than in previous ones (12, 13). a
likely explanation is that the levodopa dose
following initiation of  xxxd2000xxx  was not always
sufficiently reduced; the mean scheduled levodopa
dose reduction in this study was approximately
40 mg compared with 75–100 mg in previous
studies (12, 13). furthermore, only 30% of
patients had their levodopa dose reduced in this
study compared with almost 50% in the nordic
study (13). on the other hand, according to home
diaries, the actual doses of levodopa used by
fluctuating patients were lower than the scheduled
doses, probably indicating that some patients
reduced their dose of levodopa on their own
accord. as expected, the incidence of dopaminergic
253

poewe et al.
aes was higher in patients who used the highest
levodopa doses or who used dopamine agonists.
overall, the present study also demonstrated that
 xxxd2000xxx  can be effectively and safely used
in combination with dopamine agonists and/or
selegiline.
as in previous studies, diarrhoea was the most
frequent non-dopaminergic ae, but was usually
not troublesome. the frequency of severe diarrhoea leading to premature withdrawal was very
low (0.5%). much higher withdrawal rates
(5–10%) as a result of diarrhoea have been
reported in long-term  xxxd3395xxx  studies (23–25).
in contrast to dopaminergic aes, diarrhoea was
not reported immediately after the introduction of
 xxxd2000xxx  and was not dose-related.
no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or
laboratory safety parameters occurred. liver transaminases were slightly elevated only in rare cases,
but to the same extent in both study groups. as no
 xxxd2000xxx -related liver toxicity was observed in
either this or other  xxxd2000xxx  studies, the known
liver damage associated with  xxxd3395xxx  is unlikely
to represent a class effect of nitrocatechol-structured drugs or to be because of comt inhibition
per se, contrary to recent speculation (26). therefore, the good safety profile of  xxxd2000xxx  was
confirmed in this study.
in conclusion, the present study, using updrs
data and home diary recordings, showed that
 xxxd2000xxx  is effective and safe in pd patients
who experience motor fluctuations, and corroborates the findings of earlier studies. this beneficial
effect of  xxxd2000xxx  was demonstrated in combination with both standard and cr levodopa
preparations in a patient population that was
also using other antiparkinsonian medications,
thus reflecting current clinical practice. the beneficial trend observed with  xxxd2000xxx  in nonfluctuating patients, who need an enhancement of
symptomatic efficacy of levodopa, warrants further
investigations.
