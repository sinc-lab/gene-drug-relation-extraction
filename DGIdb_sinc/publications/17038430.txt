ventricular load can precipitate development of the heart failure syndrome, yet the molecular
components that control the cardiac adaptive response to imposed demand remain partly
understood. compromised atp-sensitive k+ (katp ) channel function renders the heart
vulnerable to stress, implicating this metabolic sensor in the homeostatic response that would
normally prevent progression of cardiac disease. here, pressure overload was imposed on the
left ventricle by transverse aortic constriction in the wild-type and in mice lacking sarcolemmal
katp channels through  xxxg1250xxx  pore knockout ( xxxg1250xxx -ko). despite equivalent haemodynamic
loads, within 30 min of aortic constriction,  xxxg1250xxx -ko showed an aberrant prolongation of
action potentials with intracellular calcium overload and atp depletion, whereas wild-type
maintained ionic and energetic handling. on catheterization, constricted  xxxg1250xxx -ko displayed
compromised myocardial performance with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, not
seen in the wild-type.  xxxd2215xxx , a  xxxg1253xxx  inhibitor, reproduced the knockout phenotype in
the wild-type, whereas the calcium channel antagonist, verapamil, prevented abnormal outcome
in  xxxg1250xxx -ko. within 48 h following aortic constriction, fulminant biventricular congestive heart
failure, characterized by exercise intolerance, cardiac contractile dysfunction, hepatopulmonary
congestion and ascites, halved the  xxxg1250xxx -ko cohort, while no signs of organ failure or
mortality were seen in wild-type. surviving  xxxg1250xxx -ko developed premature and exaggerated
fibrotic myocardial hypertrophy associated with nuclear up-regulation of calcium-dependent
pro-remodelling mef2 and nf-at pathways, precipitating chamber dilatation within 3 weeks.
thus, katp channels appear mandatory in acute and chronic cardiac adaptation to imposed
haemodynamic load, protecting against congestive heart failure and death.

unique among ion channels, atp-sensitive k+ (katp )
channels operate as molecular rheostats adjusting
membrane potential-dependent functions to match
cellular energetic demands (alekseev et al. 2005; miki
& seino, 2005; nichols, 2006). underscoring the critical
role for katp channels in coupling metabolic dynamics
with electrical activity is the recognition that disruption
of channel function can compromise vital homeostatic
functions leading to life-threatening disease (ashcroft,
2005). in particular, dysfunction in  xxxg1253xxx  gating
has been linked with insulin secretory disorders, such as
congenital hyperinsulinism and more recently neonatal
diabetes (thomas et al. 1995; dunne et al. 2004; gloyn

et al. 2004; ashcroft, 2005; babenko et al. 2006; pearson
et al. 2006). beyond an isolated failure of pancreatic beta-cells,
mutations in  xxxg1250xxx , the gene encoding the pore-forming
 xxxg1250xxx  subunit of katp channels (aguilar-bryan et al. 1995;
inagaki et al. 1995), have been reported to be pathogenic
in a discrete syndrome encompassing, with diabetes,
developmental delay and epilepsy (proks et al. 2004;
hattersley & ashcroft, 2005; gloyn et al. 2006).  xxxg1250xxx  is
also integral in the make-up of myocardial katp channels
(inagaki et al. 1996), and targeted disruption of  xxxg1250xxx 
generates  xxxg1250xxx -deficient mice that lack functional katp
channels in ventricular myocytes (suzuki et al. 2001).
although intact  xxxg1250xxx  is required in cardiac adaptation to

physiological stress (zingman et al. 2002a, 2003), limited
information is presently available on the repercussions
of  xxxg1253xxx  malfunction in the development and
progression of heart disease (kane et al. 2005).
originally discovered in cardiomyocytes (noma, 1983),
katp channels are abundant within the sarcolemma
where they assemble as heteromultimers of  xxxg1250xxx , the
 xxxg1249xxx  pore, and sur2a, the
regulatory sulphonylurea receptor subunit (inagaki et al.
1996; lorenz & terzic, 1999; nichols, 2006). integrated
with cellular metabolic pathways (dzeja & terzic 1998;
carrasco et al 2001; abraham et al. 2002; selivanov et al.
2004; dhar-chowdhury et al. 2005; jovanovic et al. 2005),
sur2a contains nucleotide binding domains and intrinsic
atpase activity, endowing this regulatory  xxxg1253xxx 
subunit with the ability to process energetic signals of
distress under conditions of increased cardiac workload
(bienengraeber et al. 2000; zingman et al. 2001; alekseev
et al. 2005). the tandem function of nucleotide binding
domains confers  xxxg1250xxx -gating competence to sur2a
(zingman et al. 2002b), leading to pore opening and
action potential shortening under stress (zingman et al.
2002a; liu et al. 2004; nichols, 2006). within the working
myocardium, this homeostatic role for cardiac katp
channels translates into preventing intracellular calcium
loading and preserving energy supplies (terzic et al.
1995; zingman et al. 2002a; hodgson et al. 2003;
kane et al. 2005). a deficit in cardiac katp channels
impairs tolerance to systemic stressors imposed by a
sympathetic surge (zingman et al. 2002a), endurance
challenge (kane et al. 2004) or hypertension (kane et al.
2006a). genetic disruption of katp channels results
in poor recovery following coronary hypoperfusion,
and compromises the protective benefits of ischaemic
preconditioning (suzuki et al. 2002; gumina et al.
2003), while overexpression of channel subunits
generates a phenotype resistant to ischaemia (du et al.
2006). moreover, missense and frameshift mutations
in the cardiac  xxxg1253xxx  isoform identified in
dilated cardiomyopathy suggest, in the setting of
compromised channel function, a genetic susceptibility
that renders the myocardium vulnerable to failure
(bienengraeber et al. 2004; kane et al. 2005). despite
these advances, the role for katp channels in adequate
myocardial adaptation under imposed left ventricular
load, a recognized risk factor of heart failure and cardiac
death, remains only partially understood.
experimentally, transverse aortic constriction directly
imposes a pressure overload on the left ventricle (rockman
et al. 1991). mechanisms of myocardial response result
in concentric ventricular hypertrophy, and preservation
of cardiac contractile function with maintenance of ionic
and energetic homeostasis within a normal heart (hunter
& chien, 1999; barki-harrington & rockman, 2003).
here, the acute and chronic consequences of myocardial

 xxxg1253xxx  deficit, through knockout of the  xxxg1250xxx 
pore, were longitudinally tested in this established model
of haemodynamic ventricular load. in the absence of
functional katp channels, physical constriction of the aorta
precipitated cardiac dysfunction through dysregulation
of action potential control of ionic balance thereby
translating into fulminant congestive heart failure and
death.
methods
protocols were carried out in accordance with the national
institutes of health guidelines, and with approval of
the mayo clinic institutional animal care and use
committee.
 xxxg1250xxx -knockout mice

mice deficient in katp channels were generated by targeted
disruption of the  xxxg1250xxx  gene and backcrossed for five
generations into a c57bl/6 background (miki et al. 1998).
due to the proximity of the mutated  xxxg1250xxx  gene with the
gene encoding albino hair colour in the sv129 embryonic
stem cells used to create the knockout, the  xxxg1250xxx -knockout
( xxxg1250xxx -ko) mice remain white upon backbreeding into
the black c57bl/6 line (kane et al. 2004). mice were kept
under a 12 h light–dark cycle and allowed free access to tap
water and standard chow.
transverse aortic constriction

isoflurane-anaesthetized (2–3%), self-ventilating, 8- to
12-week-old, male, c57bl/6 wild-type and  xxxg1250xxx -ko
mice underwent aortic constriction at the level of the
thoracic aorta, between the origin of the right innominate
and left common carotid arteries (fig. 1a). heart and
respiration rates, as well as animal reflexes were monitored
throughout. the aortic constriction was imposed using
a 27-gauge needle to standardize the extent of stenosis
(fig. 1b; rockman et al. 1991). a subgroup of wild-type
and  xxxg1250xxx -ko mice underwent sham surgery consisting
of aortic exposure without ligation. all mice were followed
for up to 3 weeks.
treadmill exercise stress test and glycaemic levels

mice were evaluated on a two-track treadmill fitted with
a shock grid which delivered a mild electrical stimulus to
encourage running (columbus instruments, columbus,
oh, usa), as previously described (zingman et al. 2002a).
the exercise-stress protocol consisted of stepwise increases
in either incline or velocity at 3 min intervals. workload
(j), a composite parameter incorporating time, speed and
incline, was calculated as the sum of kinetic (e k = mv 2 /2)
and potential (e p = mgvtsintheta ) energy, where m represents

animal mass, v treadmill velocity, g acceleration due to
gravity, t elapsed time at a protocol level, and theta angle of
incline (zingman et al. 2002a). separately, blood glucose
levels were measured by tail sampling (onetouch ultra,
lifescan, milpitas, ca, usa) after a 16 h overnight fast
(‘fasting’) as previously described (kane et al. 2004).
echocardiography

serial transthoracic echocardiography was performed
prior to and at predetermined time points after transverse
aortic constriction under light sedation (1.5% isoflurane).
images were digitally acquired and stored for off-line
blinded analysis. measurements of left ventricular (lv)
dimensions were recorded at end-diastole (lvdd) and
end-systole (lvds) from three consecutive cardiac cycles
using the leading edge convention of the american society
of echocardiography (kane et al. 2004). left ventricular
fractional shortening (%fs) was defined as percentage
fs = [(lvdd − lvds)/lvdd] × 100. ejection time (e t )
was determined from the actual pulsed-wave doppler
tracings on the parasternal long-axis view of transaortic
flow by measuring the interval from the beginning of the
acceleration to the end of the deceleration. myocardial
velocity of left ventricular circumferential shortening (v cf
expressed in circumferences per second) was calculated as
v cf = [(lvdd − lvds)/lvdd] × e t (kane et al. 2006b).

international, st paul, mn, usa). electrocardiogram
signals were acquired at 2 khz (zingman et al. 2002a;
kane et al. 2006b).
epicardial electrophysiology

in vivo electrophysiological measurements were obtained
by a stably placed epicardial probe (ep technologies,
san jose, ca, usa) to record monophasic action
potentials (map) in 2% isofluorane-anaesthetized,
mechanically ventilated mice before or after transverse
aortic constriction. animals were right ventricularly paced
to maintain the heart rate of 500 bpm (catheter; numed,
hopkinton, ny, usa, stimulator; a310 accupulser,
world precision instruments, sarasota, fl, usa). action
potential duration at 90% repolarization (apd90 ) was
compared between groups.
calcium imaging

thirty minutes after transverse aortic constriction,
cardiectomy was performed under 5% isoflurane terminal
anaesthesia and hearts in a subgroup of wild-type
and  xxxg1250xxx -ko animals rapidly excised for isolation
of cardiomyocytes (hodgson et al. 2003; liu et al.
2004). rod-shaped single cardiomyocytes were loaded

magnetic resonance imaging

magnetic resonance imaging with a 7 t scanner
(bruker, billerica, ma, usa) was performed on 2%
isofluorane-anaesthetized mice with an electrocardiogram-triggered fast-gradient echo cine sequence,
through a short-axis slice of 1.0-mm thickness at the
midpapillary muscle level (zingman et al. 2002a).
the cardio-thoracic ratio (ctr) was measured in the
transverse plane.
left ventricular catheterization

in vivo haemodynamics were recorded, in 2%
isofluorane-anaesthetized mechanically ventilated mice,
directly by a 1.4-fr micropressure catheter (spr-671,
millar instruments, houston, tx, usa; zingman et al.
2002a; kane et al. 2006a) following carotid arterial
cannulation and advancement across the aortic valve,
before or after transverse aortic constriction. transaortic
gradient was defined as the difference between peak
systemic pressure and the peak left ventricular pressure.

with the calcium-fluorescent probe fluo-4-acetoxymethyl
ester (2 mum; molecular probes), and scanned using the
488 nm line of an argon/krypton laser in an oxygenated
chamber at 36 ± 1◦ c. two-dimensional confocal images
(zeiss lsm 510 axiovert, thornwood, ny, usa) were
deconvoluted, and analysed using metamorph (visitron
universal imaging, downingtown, pa, usa) normalized
to the degree of background fluorescence (o’cochlain et al.
2004; hodgson et al. 2004).
metabolic probing

whole heart atp levels were determined in 0.6 m
perchloric acid–1 mm edta extracts from liquid n2
freeze-clamped myocardium. extracts were neutralized
with 2 m k2 hco3 , and adenine nucleotides eluted with
a linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer
and profiled by high-performance liquid chromatography
(hp1100, hewlett-packard, ajax, ontario, canada) using
a mono q hr5/5 column (amersham pharmacia biotech
inc, piscataway, nj, usa) as described (perez-terzic et al.
2001; dzeja et al. 2002).
pathology and immunochemistry

the whole heart, left ventricle, liver and lungs were
removed under 5% isoflurane terminal anaesthesia,
rinsed, blotted dry, and weighed. lung and liver samples
were dried at 65◦ c for 48 h, and reweighed. interstitial
fibrosis was quantified by computer analysis (metamorph,
visitron universal imaging, downingtown, pa,
usa) of 0.5 mum thick, paraffin-embedded, masson’s
trichrome-stained sections as described (kane et al.
2006a). to probe the expression of the pro-hypertrophic
cardiac transcription factor myocyte enhancing
factor 2 (mef2), isolated cardiomyocytes were fixed in
3% paraformaldehyde, and primary antibodies to the
cardiac sarcomeric protein alpha-actinin (mouse polyclonal,
1 : 500; sigma, st louis, mo, usa) and mef2 (rabbit
polyclonal, 1 : 300; cell signalling technologies, danvers,
ma, usa; behfar et al. 2005) applied at 4◦ c overnight.
respective secondary antibodies (molecular probes)
were incubated with the sample for 60 min, along with
nuclear counter-staining achieved by a 3 min application
of 300 nm 4 ,6 -diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride
(dapi; molecular probes). images were acquired by
laser confocal microscopy (zeiss lsm 510 axiovert,
thornwood, ny, usa) as described (behfar & terzic,
2006). for downstream immunoblotting analysis, left
ventricular tissue was homogenized and the lysate assessed
for protein content using a dc protein assay (bio-rad
laboratories, hercules, ca, usa). a final amount of
60 mug of total protein was loaded onto a 10% sds-page
gel and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. to
investigate levels of the stress-activated kinase, p38,

the membrane was incubated with anti-p38 primary
antibodies (rabbit polyclonal, 1 : 1000; cell signalling
technologies, danvers, ma, usa) overnight at 4◦ c
after blocking with 5% skim milk. goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (chemicon international inc.,
temecula, ca, usa) were applied the next day for
60 min and then developed using the pierce supersignal
chemiluminescence kit (pierce biotechnology, rockford,
il, usa). bands were visualized using the uvp imager
(uvp inc, upland, ca, usa) and analysis performed
using nih imagej software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
electrophoretic mobility shift assay

to determine the dna binding activity of the nuclear
factor of activated t cells (nf-at), nuclear extracts were
prepared by hypotonic lysis of left ventricles followed
by enrichment using density centrifugation. non-specific
binding was prevented by addition of the mild detergent
sodium  xxxd1835xxx , which was added to the purified
nuclear extract to a final concentration of 0.4%, incubated
on ice 1 h, and clarified by centrifugation through 1 m
sucrose at 200 000 g for 1 h at 4◦ c. a labelled dna element
from the b-type natriuretic peptide promoter served as a
probe for electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed
as described (kane et al. 2006a). specificity of binding
was assessed by competition with an excess of unlabelled
probe, further validated by two-point mutations of the
nf-at binding region.
statistical analysis

data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. comparison
of parameters was performed using student’s t test.
kaplan-meier analysis with log-rank testing was employed
for survival analysis. a p-value < 0.05 was considered

transverse aortic constriction (fig. 1a and b), an
established in vivo model of haemodynamic overload
(rockman et al. 1991), induced significant and equivalent
left ventricle pressure load on both wild-type and
 xxxg1253xxx  knockout ( xxxg1250xxx -ko) hearts (fig. 2a

transaortic pressure gradient acutely increased from
6 ± 6 to 59 ± 6 mmhg in wild-type (n = 5), and
from 8 ± 5 to 64 ± 10 mmhg in  xxxg1250xxx -ko (n = 5;

of myocardial injury (not illustrated). despite this

versus  xxxg1250xxx -ko), there was a divergent electrophysiological response between wild-type and katp
channel knockout mice within 5 min of transverse
aortic constriction (fig. 2c). while monophasic action
potential duration, measured at 90% repolarization
(apd90 ), shortened in the wild-type by −4.8 ± 1.8%
(n = 6, p = 0.03), it was prolonged in  xxxg1250xxx -ko by
+34.2 ± 11.8% (n = 8, p = 0.004; fig. 2d). the aberrant
prolongation in repolarization seen in the  xxxg1250xxx -ko
was also observed in wild-type mice pretreated with the
 xxxg1253xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2215xxx  (20 mug g−1 , oral, n = 5;
fig. 2d). treatment with the calcium channel antagonist
verapamil (5 mug g−1 , i.p.), prior to transverse aortic
constriction, prevented the action potential prolongation
in the  xxxg1250xxx -ko (n = 7; fig. 2d), indicating that in
the absence of functional katp channels prolongation
of action potential is mediated by exaggerated calcium
influx. the reduced repolarization reserve in  xxxg1253xxx 
knockout mice precipitated myocyte calcium overload, as
evidenced by the elevated intensity of the calcium-sensitive
fluorescent probe fluo-4 in cardiomyocytes acutely
isolated from constricted  xxxg1250xxx -ko versus equivalently
stressed wild-type hearts, i.e. 185 ± 17 au (n = 8) versus
59 ± 9 au (n = 6), respectively (p < 0.001; fig. 2e).
deficits in repolarization response and calcium
handling were associated with energetic and haemodynamic consequences in  xxxg1250xxx -ko mice. within
30 min of transverse aortic constriction,  xxxg1250xxx -ko
had evidence of energetic compromise with
significantly lower myocardial atp concentrations
compared to constricted wild-type counterparts,
i.e. 17.0 ± 0.6 nmol (mg protein)−1 (n = 7) versus
23.0 ± 1.6 nmol (mg protein)−1 (n = 7), respectively
(p = 0.003; fig. 2f). energetically impaired  xxxg1250xxx -ko
displayed evidence of diastolic dysfunction with
significantly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic
pressures (18.9 ± 4.4 mmhg, n = 5) compared to
similarily constricted wild-type mice (3.2 ± 1.2 mmhg,
n = 5, p = 0.02; fig. 2g and h). as with the electrophysiological response, elevations in the end-diastolic
pressure in constricted  xxxg1250xxx -ko could be prevented with
verapamil (2.7 ± 3.3 mmhg, n = 5, p = 0.03; fig. 2h) to
levels similar to those in constricted wild-type (p > 0.05;
fig. 2h), demonstrating the requirement of intact katp
channels in preserving electrical and ionic homeostasis,
and thereby safeguarding myocardial performance under
imposed pressure overload.

these early signs of myocardial dysfunction rapidly
progressed to overt heart failure (fig. 3). within hours

(fig. 3b–d), hepatopulmonary congestion (fig. 3e–h)
and ascites, along with systemic fluid retention and
anasarca (fig. 3a and g). transthoracic echocardiograms
within 24 h of aortic constriction demonstrated severely
impaired ventricular systolic function in  xxxg1250xxx -ko, but
not wild-type mice, as indicated by reduced fractional
shortening, i.e. 35 ± 4% (n = 6) versus 49 ± 2% (n = 4),

consistent with the rapid decline in cardiac function
leading to fulminant heart failure, telemetry readings
detected progressive sinus bradycardia followed by gradual
prolongation of atrio-ventricular conduction, ultimately
developing into atrio-ventricular conduction block
preceding death in the  xxxg1250xxx -ko (fig. 4a). consistent

with  xxxg1253xxx  knockout mice dying of progressive

were detected (fig. 4a). half of the  xxxg1250xxx -ko (n = 20 out
of 40) died within 48 h of aortic constriction, compared
to no mortality in similarly challenged wild-type mice
(n = 31), sham-operated wild-type (n = 16) or katp
channel knockout (n = 15) controls (p < 0.001; fig. 4b).
thus, following the imposition of pressure loading on
the myocardium, the absence of functional katp channels
results in the rapid development of severe congestive heart
failure and massive death, not experienced in equivalently
challenged wild-type mice.

constricted  xxxg1250xxx -ko survivors showed a significant

contrast to only 25% (n = 10/40) of  xxxg1250xxx -ko mice
(p = 0.009). when evaluating the survivors,  xxxg1250xxx -ko
mice (n = 7) had extreme exercise intolerance compared to
the wild-type (n = 6), i.e. 72 ± 16% versus 15 ± 9% decline
in exercise capacity (p = 0.02; fig. 5a) in the absence of
a difference in serum glucose levels, i.e. 105 ± 3 mg dl−1
versus 86 ± 27 mg dl−1 in wild-type (n = 14) and
 xxxg1250xxx -ko (n = 8), respectively (p > 0.05). pressure
loaded hearts in  xxxg1250xxx -ko mice had demonstrable
exaggerated levels of cardiac remodelling in comparison to
wild-type (fig. 5b–e). within 7–10 days following aortic
constriction, transthoracic echocardiograms showed
significant increase in left ventricular wall thickness,
measured as the sum of interventricular septal thickness
and posterior wall thickness, in constricted  xxxg1250xxx -ko
(n = 6) when compared to constricted wild-type (n = 5)
mice (p = 0.02; fig. 5b), suggesting an increased
propensity towards cardiac hypertrophy. indeed, left
ventricular dimensions were significantly increased,
within 3 weeks postconstriction, in  xxxg1250xxx -ko (n = 6)
compared to wild-type (n = 8) mice (p = 0.047; fig. 5c).
this was confirmed ex vivo (fig. 5d), with a 31 ± 8%
increase in left ventricular mass measured in  xxxg1250xxx -ko
mice  xxxd2274xxx –10 days postaortic constriction (p = 0.01,
n = 8), in contrast to a non-significant change observed in
constricted wild-type hearts at the equivalent time point
(10 ± 5%, n = 14, p > 0.05; fig. 5e).
this exaggerated hypertrophic response was associated
with an increase in calcium-dependent pro-hypertrophic
signalling in isolated cardiomyocytes, indicated by a
significantly augmented expression of the transcription
factor mef2 in constricted  xxxg1250xxx -ko (195 ± 6 au,
n = 40 cardiomyocytes) compared to wild-type nuclei
(135 ± 8 au, n = 60 cardiomyocytes, p < 0.001;
fig. 6a and b). additionally, comparison of nuclear
extracts demonstrated in the  xxxg1250xxx -ko up-regulated
calcium-dependent translocation of nf-at, complexing
with high specificity to the b-type natriuretic peptide gene
promoter element (fig. 6c), a marker of pathological
cardiac remodelling (molkentin et al. 1998; crabtree
& olson, 2002). the p38 stress-activated cascade of
cardiac hypertrophy was indistinguishably affected by
pressure overload in the presence or absence of katp
channels (n = 3 in each group; p > 0.05). thus, the
excessive myocardial hypertrophy seen in the constricted
 xxxg1250xxx -ko over that in the respective wild-type is
associated with a differential up-regulation of canonical
calcium-dependent hypertrophic pathways (molkentin,
2004). the propensity for myocardial maladaptation was
further underlined by an increased degree of interstitial
fibrosis in constricted  xxxg1250xxx -ko compared to wild-type
hearts (p = 0.005; fig. 6d and e).
serial assessment of left ventricular structure indicated
a difference not only in the extent, but also in the
rate of the remodelling response between pressure

not wild-type mice, demonstrated chamber dilatation
in addition to thickened walls, suggesting a transition
to a decompensated remodelling response. magnetic
resonance imaging independently confirmed cardiomegaly, as defined by the cardio-thoracic ratio, in pressure
overloaded  xxxg1250xxx -ko compared to wild-type (fig. 7d).
thus, lack of katp channels, even in animals that survive
the acute phase of pressure overload, produces long-term
physical intolerance and myocardial maladaptation.

in the setting of transverse aortic constriction, precipitated
acutely fulminant congestive heart failure producing a
dramatic survival disadvantage, with survivors exhibiting
chronically exaggerated cardiac remodelling associated
with poor outcome. thus, the present study, using
the  xxxg1250xxx  knockout model, unmasks a previously
unrecognized protective role for katp channels in aortic
constriction-induced congestive heart failure, establishing
in vivo  xxxg1253xxx  deficit as a novel susceptibility
mechanism for cardiac disease under conditions creating
left ventricular pressure overload.
this is of significance since the left ventricle is exposed
to pressure overload in diverse pathological conditions,
generating a build-up of biomechanical stress, triggering
a neurohumoral surge, and imposing increased energy
consumption and metabolic distress upon the myocardium (hunter & chien, 1999; barki-harrington
& rockman, 2003). as myocardial katp channels
harness mechanosensitive gating and energetic decoding
capabilities, they are uniquely positioned to serve as
stress-responsive elements providing a high-fidelity
feedback mechanism capable of adjusting cellular
excitability to match demand and protect the
myocardium (noma, 1983; van wagoner, 1993; zingman
et al. 2002a; alekseev et al. 2005). while the exact
mechanism responsible for  xxxg1253xxx  opening under
acute pressure overload imposed by transverse aortic
constriction has not been identified, channel activation
could be the consequence of mechanical stretch (van
wagoner, 1993; saegusa et al. 2005) and/or imbalance of
supply versus demand (kane et al. 2006a; nichols, 2006).

discussion
heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality, with haemodynamic loading of the myocardium
a recognized risk factor in the pathogenesis of disease
(towbin & bowles, 2002; thom et al. 2006). a paradigm
of cardiac haemodynamic insult that commonly underlies
the syndrome of heart failure is a state of pressure
overload imposed upon the left ventricle (chien, 1999).
yet, the genetic determinants that dictate whether a
heart will transition from a state of risk load to one
of overt disease remain partially understood (ahmad
et al. 2005). identifying molecular components vital for
myocardial adaptation would advance the understanding
of cardioprotective pathways in the haemodynamically
challenged heart.
here, we report that under imposed pressure overload
cardiac katp channels are required to maintain electrical,
ionic and metabolic balance, preventing myocardial
dysfunction and development of organ failure. genetic

 xxxg1250xxx  knockout precipitates heart failure

indeed, the findings in this study implicate the cardiac
 xxxg1253xxx  as the electrophysiological regulator of ionic
balance in the myocardium under haemodynamic stress
imposed by sustained aortic constriction. this broadens
the homeostatic implications for this k+ conductance
beyond ischaemia (suzuki et al. 2002; gumina et al.
2003), sympathomimetic challenge (zingman et al.
2002a; liu et al. 2004), physical exertion (kane et al.
2004) or mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension
(kane et al. 2006a), recently linked to myocardial katp
channel-mediated protection in the  xxxg1250xxx  knockout
model.
through safeguarding against cardiomyocellular
calcium overload, the  xxxg1253xxx  allowed necessary
left ventricular function required to combat imposed
challenge of aortic constriction, while maintaining
energetic stability. katp channels are recognized regulators
of cardiac repolarization reserve under stress (liu et al.
2004; tong et al. 2006), and are integral to energetic

48 h following tac in the presence of 50-fold excess of

dna probe (lane 6). note the up-regulated nf-at
complex formation with the promoter element (arrows)
in tac ko (lane 4) compared to pre ko (lane 3) or wt
counterparts (lane 1 and 2). the specificity of nf-at
binding to the dna probe was validated by competition
with an excess of cold probe used as control (c; lane 5).
point mutations (m) in the nf-at binding region of the

labelled consensus sequence (lane 6). the presented

circuits and myocardial well-being (dzeja & terzic, 1998;
gumina et al. 2003; zingman et al. 2003). loss of this
stress-monitor rapidly unbalances cellular homeostasis
resulting in failure of primary heart function. specifically,
within 30 min of pressure overload, hearts lacking katp
channels lost action potential control of calcium influx,
creating a susceptibility to a cascade of contractile
dysfunction, heart failure and death. the observed sinus
bradycardia is consistent with the failing heart phenotype
and the generalized deterioration of myocardial function
(kane et al. 2006a), and has been reported to be common
in advanced heart failure (luu et al. 1989). by 48 h of
aortic constriction, half of the  xxxg1250xxx  knockout cohort
had succumbed, and upon 3 weeks of follow-up even
the hearts of those knockout mice who survived were
driven to an exaggerated pathological remodelling
with compromised organ function. this dramatic
short- and long-term vulnerability, under conditions of
imposed ventricular load, underscores the requirement

for  xxxg1253xxx  checkpoints in preventing calcium
accumulation and associated deleterious events. calcium
overload predisposes to malignant calcium-triggered gene
reprogramming and structural remodelling precipitating
pump failure (wehrens et al. 2005; molkentin, 2006).
as shown here, distal from defective katp channels,
accumulation of calcium triggered an up-regulation
of the calcium-dependent transcription factor mef2.
identified within the nucleus of cardiomyocytes from
constricted  xxxg1250xxx  knockout, but not wild-type hearts,
mef2 induction has been associated with activation of
pro-remodelling and maladaptive myocardial pathways
underlying the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and failure (frey & olson, 2003). moreover,
 xxxg1253xxx  knockouts are prone under chronic
stress to up-regulate expression of the serine/threonine
protein phosphatase calcineurin, a key calcium-dependent
determinant of pathological cardiac remodelling (kane
et al. 2006a). upon calcium-dependent activation,
calcineurin dephosphorylates nf-at facilitating its
import into the nucleus to mediate pro-remodelling gene
activation (crabtree & olson, 2002). indeed, compared to
constricted wild-type,  xxxg1250xxx -ko counterparts exhibited
increased complex formation of nf-at with dna
encoding the b-type natriuretic peptide promoter region, a
prototypic step in the remodelling process (molkentin et al.
1998). altogether, these findings provide a mechanistic
basis for a causal relationship linking  xxxg1253xxx  deficit
with induction of maladaptive signalling pathways leading
to development of heart failure under pressure overload.
the present findings are further underscored by
the identification in humans that defective katp
channels, induced by mutations in  xxxg20xxx  encoding the
regulatory sur2a subunit, confer susceptibility to dilated
cardiomyopathy (bienengraeber et al. 2004). the ultimate
phenotype in the  xxxg1250xxx  knockout, under pressure
overload, is development of heart failure with cardiac
chamber dilatation, a phenotype similar to that observed
in patients with mutations in  xxxg1253xxx  genes. that
gene knockout of the  xxxg1253xxx  compromises cardioprotection precipitating heart failure with fatal outcome
could further suggest that treatment with  xxxg1253xxx 
blocking agents, such as the sulphonylureas, may also
compromise myocardial tolerance to injury. in specific
cohorts of patients, sulphonylurea use has been associated
with potential deleterious outcomes, including increased
risk of early mortality (brady & terzic, 1998; garratt et al.
1999) or increase in left ventricular mass, a risk factor
for morbidity and mortality (lee et al. 2006). typical for
the progression of heart failure is an extensive ventricular
remodelling initially comprising cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis, resulting in increase in ventricular
mass (chien, 1999), as seen in  xxxg1250xxx -knockout mice
following aortic constriction. this remodelling process is
generally recognized to underlie the pathogenesis of the

 xxxg1250xxx  knockout precipitates heart failure

heart failure syndrome of various aetiologies progressing
to decompensated, dilated, cardiomyopathy (towbin &
bowles, 2002; ahmad et al. 2005). in view of reported
genetic polymorphisms in  xxxg1250xxx  encoding  xxxg1250xxx 
(riedel et al. 2005), the present demonstration that katp
channels protect against the development of congestive
heart failure and death, securing both acute and chronic
cardiac adaptation to imposed haemodynamic load,
provides a foundation for further investigation of the role
of these cardioprotective channels in the population at
large.
