 xxxd2753xxx  (ngm), a derivative of 19-nortestosterone with very specific affinity for
the  xxxg1737xxx , has been used in combination with  xxxd2054xxx  (ee) at
low doses in both monophasic and triphasic oral contraceptives (ocs). an open-label
comparative clinical trial was conducted with 4,234 healthy women using triphasic levonorgestrel (lng)/ee and ngm/ee through a total of 22.312 menstrual cycles. contraceptive efficacy was excellent with both preparations, with no statistically significant
between-regimen differences in pregnancy rates. the theoretical pearl index was 0.12 for
the ngmlee triphasic, and 0.34 for the lnglee triphasic. adverse experiences in both
groups were typical of those that may occur among women taking low-dose oc agents.
the percentage of subjects discontinuing treatment because of use-related adverse experiences was similar with the two preparations: 8.6% for the ngm/ee triphasic and 6.8%
for the lngiee triphasic. in a separate mechanism of action study, specific endocrine
parameters were investigated in 20 subjects using the ngm/ee triphasic for 4 cycles.
ovulation suppression was demonstrated in statistically significant decreases from pretreatment values in serum levels of  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx , follicle-stimulating hormone,
progesterone, and estradiol. significant on-treatment increases in serum levels of sex
hormone binding globulin evidenced minimal androgenicity. all hormonal values returned to or toward normal in the post-treatment cycle. the study results support those
obtained in large noncornparative studies of the ngm/ee triphasic. this phased-dose
combination suppresses ovulation and is a very effective, minimally androgenic contraceptive agent with a good safety profile.

introduction
the 1990s will be an exciting decade for clinicians
using combined oral contraceptives (ocs) because
of the introduction of pills containing previously unavailable progestins. some of these new contraceptive options will be pills containing  xxxd2753xxx 
(ngm), a 19-nortestosterone derivative with very
specific affinity for the progestin receptor. however,
there is limited clinical information available from

united states comparative trials using these new
contraceptives.
in u. s. multicenter trials, monophasic n g w
 xxxd2054xxx  (ee) pills have proved to be safe
and effective (1).
to continue the trend of decreasing the doses of
steroid hormones in ocs to minimize side effects,
pharmacologists have developed a new phased-dose
preparation containing ee and ngm (ortho tricyclena, tri-cilestb). this regimen combines a

parative multicenter study of the two preparations
used through six menstrual cycles. the steroid content and the design of the two triphasic preparations
are illustrated in fig. 1. after informed consent was
obtained, subjects who met the entrance critcria
were assigned randomly to one regimen or the other.
contraceptive efficacy was assessed by evaluation of
pregnancies and pregnancy rates. case evaluation
was blinded to the preparation being used. safety
was assessed by analysis of type and incidence of
adverse effects and results of specialized laboratory
tests, including an androgen profile in a subset o f
women. the subjects were evaluated before treatment, near the end of treatment cycle 3 , and after
treatment cycle 6.

daily monophasic 35-pg dose of ee with three stepwise increasing dosages of ngm and was developed
to minimize unwanted metabolic effects by reducing
the total dose of progestin.
effects of the ngm/ee triphasic on lipid and
carbohydrate metabolism were investigated over a
total of 28,527 treatment cycles in 1,783 women (2).
changes in lipid/lipoprotein parameters and glucose
and insulin levels were indicative of minimal androgenicity. to determine how the actual clinical performance of this new triphasic oc compares with
that of the widely used triphasic formulation containing the gonane levonorgestrel (lng), an open
comparative clinical trial was performed at 29 centers throughout the united states. these findings
will be reviewed.
additionally, because the mechanism of action of
new progestins is of both clinical and research interest, a second investigation was undertaken to elucidate information concerning the effects of
ngmiee triphasic pills on specific endocrine parameters. the findings of this study are of interest
not only to determine how pregnancy is averted
using the new pills, but also to account for some of
the protective effects associated with the use of combined oc agents, including the suppression of functional ovarian cysts (3). these findings will also be
presented.

methods
the first investigation was designed to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of triphasic ngm/ee when cornpared with a triphasic lng/ee pill. this was a cornacru o b ~ r e rgynecol scund sirppl 156 (19y2)

study population

the subjects were to be healthy women aged 18 t o
38 years with normal menstrual cycles, who were
sexually active and not pregnant. no evidence o f
cervical dysplasia was to be present on a papanicolaou smear. postpartum and post-termination
subjects were to be admitted following the next
spontaneous menses. all means of contraception
other than the test preparations were to be discontinued before the study. if an intrauterine device had
been used, at least one normal menstrual cycle was
to follow its removal before entry o f the subject into
the study.
among the exclusion criteria were a history o f
vascular disorders, notably thrombophlebitis or
thromboembolism, and a history of disorders possibly related to estrogen-containing products. use o f
an investigational drug or device within the previous
30 days was also an exclusion criterion. the subjects
were required to record pill usage, any concomitant
therapy, and any adverse experiences. subjects who
discontinued the study drug were to be reexamined
as they were at entry.
the second investigation was designed to evaluate
the endocrine effects of the triphasic ngmiee pill.
this was a 6-cycle study comprising a pretreatment
cycle, 4 treatment cycles, and a post-treatment cycle.
baseline studies taken in the control cycle included a
papanicolaou smear; hematology; blood chemistry:
urinalysis; and physical, gynecologic, and ophthalmologic examinations. in each of the four treatment
cycles, the ngm/ee triphasic was used by subjects
for 21 days, followed by 7 days without treatment.
measurements were repeated at the end of treatment cycle 4 and at the end of the post-treatment
cycle. in total, 20 healthy women aged 23 to 37 years
were enrolled, and each had documented ovulation
in the cycle preceding treatment.

'' of the 4,633 patients admitted to the study, 3,234 were
evaluable for efficacy.

samples were drawn between 7 a m and 10 a m on
multiple cycle days. samples were frozen and assaycd later for estradiol (el), progesterone (p), folliclc-stimulating hormone (fsh), and  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  (lh) by standard radioinimunoassay techniques.
data ana1y.si.r
contraceptive efficacy was assessed by the pearl index. the pearl index is defined as the number of
pregnancies per 100 woman-years of exposure. the
log rank test and the gehan generalized wilcoxon
test were used to determine differences in pregnancy
rates between regimens during the test period.
statistical tests were two-tailed and conducted at
the 5%) significance lcvcl without adjustments for
multiple comparisons.

results
in the investigation for safety and efficacy, a total of
2.1 10 women aged 16 to 41 years took the ngm/ee
triphasic for at least one cycle; 1,597 completed 6
cycles of treatment. a total of 2,124 women aged 16
to 30 years took the lng/ee triphasic for at least
one cycle; 1,667 women completed 6 cycles. there
were 11,006 cycles of treatment with ngm/ee and
11,306 cycles with lng/ee. the two groups were
similar demographically at the initiation of the investigation (table i). the demographic data for the
two treatment groups were comparable at baseline.
contraceptive efficacy
excellent contraceptive efficacy was demonstrated
with both regimens during the study. there were no
statistically significant differences between the prep-

11

arations in pregnancy rates. pregnant patients were
assessed with regard to compliance in the cycle of
conception. seven of 8 pregnancies occurred in the
ngm/ee triphasic group hecause patients failed to
take the preparation daily as prescribed. there were
7 pregnancies with the lng/ee triphasic, 4 involving noncompliance. and 3 product failures. the theoretical pearl index, which excludes from calculation
those pregnancies where noncompliance was a factor, were 0.12 and 0.34 with the ngm/ee triphasic
and the lng/ee triphasic, respectively; the overall
pearl indexes, which include pregnancies in noncompliant patients, were 0.94 and 0.80, respectively.
safety and adverse effects
a review of all adverse experiences revealed that
they are characteristic of those that may occur
among women using low-dose ocs (table 11). these
included headache, nausea, mastodynia, and dysmenorrhea. adverse experiences that resulted in the
discontinuation of oc use occurred primarily in the
first three cycles of the study. among those with
adverse experience information, the number of subjects who discontinued treatment because of userelated adverse experiences was similar with the two
preparations: ngm/ee triphasic, 8.6'x (i82 of
2,115 subjects); lnglee triphasic, 6.8% (135 of
2,132 subjects).
androgen effects
a subset of 45 subjects was evaluated for shbg
changes. values for shbg increased from baseline
to cycle 6 with triphasic ngm/ee (56.7 nmol/l), but
decreased 6.0 nmol/l with triphasic lng/ee, a net
difference of 62.7 nmol/l. this represents a 68.6%
increase with triphasic ngm/ee vs a 6.1"an decrease
with triphasic lng/ee, a between-regimen difference significant at the 5% level. free testosterone
levels dropped 18.2% from baseline to cyclc 6 in the

significant.

hormonal function
in the investigation of the n g w e e triphasic effects
on ovarian, pituitary, and adrenal functions, the new
oc formulation suppressed ovulation in all 20
women, as evidenced by on-treatment decreases in
serum levels of l h , fsh, p, and e, (figs 2-5).
changes in serum levels of the other endocrine analytes (eg, increased  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  and thyroidstimulating hormone concentrations, and decreased
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) were statistically
significant but were not considered clinically important. the exception was a significant increase in sex
hormone binding globulin (shbg), a manifestation
of low androgenicity. at cycle 4, shbg levels
showed a change from pretreatment of 204%. values for all the analytes returned to or toward normal
in the post-treatment cycle, during which ovulation
was again demonstrable in 19 of the 20 subjects. the
mean post-treatment concentrations of fsh, l h , p,
and ez were similar to pretreatment concentrations,
indicating a rapid return to ovulatory status.

over the course of the study, there were n o clinically meaningful changes in vital signs o r in the
results of the examinations or laboratory tests.

discussion
in the near future, practitioners are going to be
faced with clinical choices about using ocs containing the new progestins in their daily practices. these
two investigations were designed to provide a body
of clinical and pharmacologic information about the
effects of one of these new pills, a new triphasic
ngm-containing oc, on a population of healthy
women. when evaluating the efficacy of a hormonal
oc, however, the effectiveness of any agent should
be determined as a direct function of the reduction
in the probability of conception, but fertility and
fecundity are not readily quantified. contraceptive
efficacy is therefore usually assessed from the number of unplanned or accidental pregnancies that occur during the time that a contraceptive agent is
used. ideally, direct comparisons of products form
the basis for efficacy assessments. analysis of the
comparison data in the large study reported here
shows that excellent contraceptive efficacy was

ported here, the significant on-treatment decreases
of the pituitary gonadotrophins and p support an
antiovulatory mechanism of action with the
ngmiee triphasic formulation. the rapid return to
normal gonadotropic function portends an excellent
return to fertility after discontinuation of the pills, a
very desirable effect of reversible contraception.
finally, the on-treatment increases in serum levels
of shbg reflect selectivity and low androgenicity,
characteristics of ngm that, in laboratory tests,
have demonstrated its similarity to  xxxd3023xxx  (5), and that in clinical use may result in
favorable effects on the lipid profile. increased serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
have been reported with ngm/ee (6).

conclusion

fig 4. mean levels of progesterone

the findings of this large study comparing ngm/ee
and lng/ee triphasic formulations support those
obtained in earlier noncomparative studies demonstrating excellent contraceptive action and selectivity. the ngm/ee triphasic is a minimally androgenic and highly effective ovulation-suppressing oc
agent with a good safety profile.

achieved with both the ngm/ee and lng/ee triphasic formulations.
additionally, no matter how effectively a contraceptive method prevents pregnancy, if the profile of
real or perceived side effects is unacceptable to individuals requiring the method, it will not be utilized.
in the case of the ngm/ee triphasic pill used in this
investigation, the profile of minor side effects as well
as discontinuations compares quite favorably with a
widely used  xxxd2754xxx -containing pill. the lack of
effect on vital signs, hematologic and biochemical
parameters bodes well for the safety profile of this
new pill.
