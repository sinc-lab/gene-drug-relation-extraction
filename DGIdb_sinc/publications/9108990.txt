summary
synopsis

 xxxd2690xxx  ( xxxd2690xxx ) is a  xxxd1997xxx  with a mean
molecular weight of 4.5kd. compared with unfractionated heparin (ufh),  xxxd2690xxx  has a greater ratio of anti- xxxg741xxx  to anti-factor iia activity, greater
bioavailability and a longer duration of action, allowing it to be administered by
subcutaneous injection for prophylaxis or treatment of thromboembolic disorders.
in clinical trials conducted in older patients (mean age usually >60 years),
 xxxd2690xxx  was at least as effective as ufh in preventing deep vein thrombosis
(dvt) and pulmonary embolism after major general or orthopaedic surgery, and
in bedridden medical patients.  xxxd2690xxx  was also at least as effective as
 xxxd1805xxx  or oral  xxxd59xxx  in preventing thromboembolic events following general and orthopaedic surgery, respectively. when used for treatment of
established dvt,  xxxd2690xxx  was at least as effective as intravenous ufh. subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx , at dosages similar to those usedfor the treatment of dvt,
produced promising results in older patients with pulmonary embolism, acute
ischaemic stroke or unstable angina.
in i study, 75% of  xxxd2690xxx -treated patients were able to complete their
treatment at home and 36% did not require admission to hospital; the potential
pharmacoeconomic implications of these results deserve further evaluation.
overall treatment costs (drug acquisition and monitoring costs) were similar for
 xxxd2690xxx  and ufh in a french study, but  xxxd2690xxx  was associated with
significantly less nursing time spent on treatment delivery.
 xxxd2690xxx  is well tolerated by older patients. the most frequently reported
adverse events in a large (n "" 4500) placebo-controlled study in general surgical
patients were wound and injection site haematoma (11.8 and 10.2%, respectively,
vs ",,6.5% for placebo). when used as prophylaxis, no significant differences in
bleeding complications were noted between  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh or  xxxd59xxx 
recipients. prophylactic  xxxd2690xxx  was associated with significantly fewer withdrawals because of adverse events than ufh in elderly bedridden medical patients. when used as treatment for dvt,  xxxd2690xxx  was generally associated
with lower occurrences of major bleeding than intravenous ufh (0.5 to 2.3% vs
2 to 5%); however, trials were not large enough to demonstrate any significant
differences between the 2 agents. similarly, the incidence of thrombocytopenia
was slightly, but generally not significantly, lower in  xxxd2690xxx  «1%) than in
ufh (:53.5%) recipients.
thus,  xxxd2690xxx  should be considered an effective and well tolerated alternative to ufh for prophylaxis and treatment of dvt in older patients, with the
advantage ofmore convenient administration and decreased monitoring requirements.

overview of
pharmacodynamic
properties

 xxxd2690xxx  ( xxxd2690xxx ) is a  xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh)
with an average molecular weight of 4.5kd; it is produced from porcine heparin
by nitrous acid depolymerisation. according to the world health organization
(who) standard, the mean amidolytic anti-x a activity of  xxxd2690xxx  is about 90
iv/mg in the presence of plasma and about 85 iv/mg in absence of plasma; its
anti-factor iia activity is 27 iv/mg.  xxxd2690xxx  activity was originally quantified
in anti- xxxg741xxx  institute choay units (icu), where i icu is equivalent to o.4liu.
the principal pharmacological properties of  xxxd2690xxx  include binding affinity for  xxxg2056xxx  and consequently anti-factor iia (antithrombin) and anti-

 xxxg741xxx  activity. anti- xxxg741xxx  to anti-factor iia ratios for standard unfractionated heparin (ufh) and  xxxd2690xxx  are reported to be 1 : 1 (by definition)
and ",3.5 : 1, respectively, reflecting the higher proportion of  xxxd2690xxx  molecules which bind to  xxxg741xxx  compared with those which bind to factor iia.
 xxxd2690xxx  exhibits dose-proportional inhibition of  xxxg741xxx . the relative importance of non- xxxg2056xxx -mediated properties of  xxxd2690xxx , including
neutralisation by  xxxg1726xxx , stimulation of  xxxg2266xxx 
release, activation offibrinolysis, and modification ofhaemorrheological parameters, remains to be fully determined.
in an ex vivo model of human venous thrombosis, both  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh
at doses commonly prescribed for the treatment of venous embolism (6150 and
12 500iu, respectively) produced similar antithrombotic effects as assessed by
fibrin deposition on activated endothelial cells and generation of markers of
thrombin and fibrin formation.
overview of
pharmacokinetic
properties

as with other lmwhs, the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2690xxx  have most
often been determined indirectly by measurement of plasma anti- xxxg741xxx  activity. the bioavailability of  xxxd2690xxx  has been reported to be ~89% compared
with 24% for ufh. following single- or multiple-dose subcutaneous injection of
 xxxd2690xxx  at doses of up to 185 iu/kg, peak plasma anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor
iia activity (amaj increased in a dose-proportional manner. durations of antifactor xa and anti-factor iia activity >0.1 iu/ml were also dependent on dose,
and were 19.3 and 17.2 hours, respectively, after single subcutaneous doses of
 xxxd2690xxx  185 iu/kg. some accumulation of antithrombotic activity appears to
occur with  xxxd2690xxx  dosages above 6150 iu/day. amax has generally been
achieved within 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous or intravenous administration of
 xxxd2690xxx .
the plasma elimination half-life ofnadroparin, as measured by disappearance
of anti- xxxg741xxx  activity, is 2.2 to 3.6 hours after intravenous and 2.3 to 5 hours
after subcutaneous injection. plasma clearance of  xxxd2690xxx  is thought to involve
non saturable renal mechanisms, although recent data suggest that  xxxd2690xxx 
undergoes metabolism in the liver before undergoing renal elimination. plasma
clearance was significantly reduced in older patients (median age 52 to 61 years)
with varying degrees of renal impairment compared with healthy volunteers (0.59
to 0.78 vs 1.17  xxxg1778xxx ). thus, accumulation of antithrombotic activity is possible in
 xxxd2690xxx  recipients with renal impairment, particularly in those receiving a
relatively high dosage [e.g. patients with established deep vein thrombosis
(dvt)].

clinical efficacy

subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  demonstrated thromboprophylactic efficacy in studies
in older patients (mean age ~ 60 years) undergoing general or orthopaedic surgery
and in bedridden medical patients. the incidence of venography-confirmed dvt
was significantly lower in general surgical patients receiving subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  3075iu once daily than after subcutaneous ufh 5000iu twice (2.5 vs 7.5%)
or 3 times daily (2.8 vs 4.5%) or  xxxd1805xxx  2500iu once daily (16.3 vs 32.3%).
the unexpectedly high rate of dvt in the latter study was thought to be due to
the high number of patients with multiple risk factors for dvt as well as more
intensive evaluation of dvt.
in patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery (mostly hip replacement),
similar incidences of dvt were observed with  xxxd2690xxx  compared with subcutaneous ufh or oral  xxxd59xxx . the incidence of proximal dvt was

significantly lower in  xxxd2690xxx - than in ufh-treated patients in 2 studies. in
bedridden hospitalised medical patients, subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  3075 iu/day
was as effective as ufh 10 000 to 15000 iv/day in the prevention of thromboembolic events.
a bodyweight-adjusted dosage of  xxxd2690xxx  8200 to 18400 iv/day in 2 divided doses was at least as effective as adjusted-dose intravenous ufh for the
treatment of venography-confirmed dvt. the percentage of  xxxd2690xxx -treated
patients showing venographic improvement was significantly higher in 1 study
(60 vs 43%), and similar in another study (56 vs 62%). in the latter study,
 xxxd2690xxx  recipients showed significantly greater improvement in arnesen (30.6
vs 16.4%) and marder (28.9 vs 15.8%) venographic scores than ufh recipients.
data from a recent abstract suggest that once daily  xxxd2690xxx  is equivalent to
twice daily  xxxd2690xxx  for the treatment of dvt. preliminary results indicated
that 8 days' treatment with subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  82 or 123 iu/kg twice daily
and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) adjusted-dose intravenous ufh
produced similar reductions in pulmonary vascular obstruction in patients with
non-massive acute pulmonary embolism.
significantly fewer chinese patients with acute ischaemic stroke had a poor
6-month outcome (death or dependency regarding daily living activities) after
treatment with subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  41 ooiu once (52%) or twice (45%) daily
for 10 days than with placebo (65%). in patients with unstable angina, subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  88 iv/kg twice daily plus aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ) was
significantly more effective than adjusted-dose intravenous ufh plus aspirin 200
mg/day or aspirin alone in reducing adverse clinical events (recurrent angina,
nonfatal myocardial infarction and urgent revascularisation procedure).
although pharmacoeconomic studies involving lmwhs, including  xxxd2690xxx ,
are scarce, recent data indicate that despite lower acquisition costs of ufh,
lmwhs are more cost effective than ufh for prophylaxis or treatment of dvt,
especially when the costs associated with anti thrombotic failure and treating
bleeding complications are considered. in a french study, overall treatment costs
(drug acquisition and monitoring costs) were similar for  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh
(ff345 vs ff337; 1992 values); use of  xxxd2690xxx  was, however, associated with
significantly less nursing time spent on treatment delivery (42 vs 104 min/wk for
ufh).
outpatient treatment of dvt with subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  was also associated with considerably less hospital resource use than ufh (mean 2.7 vs 8.1 days
in hospital) but required 2 outpatient nursing visits and 2.2 follow-up telephone
calls per patient. unfortunately, no cost data were applied to either inpatient or
outpatient resource use.
tolerability

 xxxd2690xxx  was well tolerated in studies in older patients. in a large study of
prophylaxis in general surgical patients (n = 4498), subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx 
3075 iu/day was associated with a significantly higher incidence of excessive
postoperative bleeding (7.7 vs 3.1 %) and wound (11.8 vs 6.3%) and injection site
(10.2 vs 6.6%) haematoma than placebo. no significant difference in the incidence of bleeding complications was noted between subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx 
and subcutaneous ufh or oral  xxxd59xxx  in patients undergoing general or
orthopaedic surgery. in elderly bedridden hospitalised patients, 10 or 28 days'
prophylaxis with subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  3075 iu/day appeared to be better
tolerated than subcutaneous ufh 5000iu 2 to 3 times daily; incidences of local

reactions, >3-fold elevations in liver transaminase levels, thrombocytopenia and
withdrawals because of drug-related adverse events were significantly lower in
 xxxd2690xxx  than in ufh recipients.
 xxxd2690xxx  =185 iu/kglday in 2 divided doses was associated with lower
incidences of major bleeding than aptf adjusted-dose intravenous ufh (0.5 to
2.3% vs 2 to 5%) in patients receiving treatment for dvt; however, the trials were
not large enough to demonstrate any significant differences between  xxxd2690xxx 
and ufh. enrolment in patient groups receiving  xxxd2690xxx  123 or 185 iu/kg
twice daily for the treatment of submassive pulmonary embolism was discontinued because of a high incidence of clinically significant major bleeding.
in patients undergoing treatment for unstable angina, the incidence of spontaneous haematomas at injection sites was significantly lower in patients receiving
 xxxd2690xxx  plus aspirin than in those receiving ufh plus aspirin (1.5 vs 14%).
local tolerability of  xxxd2690xxx  was significantly superior to that of enoxaparin
in healthy volunteers and elderly bedridden hospitalised patients, with  xxxd2690xxx 
recipients reporting significantly less injection site pain, haematoma, swelling,
burning and itching than enoxaparin recipients.
postmarketing assessment of spontaneous adverse event reports data based on
> 15 million  xxxd2690xxx  patient treatments in france indicated a low incidence of
thrombocytopenia (<0.001 %). in comparative clinical trials, the incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was <1 % in  xxxd2690xxx  recipients and ::;3.5% in
ufh recipients.
dosage and
administration

drug dosages of  xxxd2690xxx  are usually expressed in injection volume in clinical
practice; the currently available drug formulation contains 9500iu of  xxxd2690xxx 
per 1ml of solution for injection. for prevention of venous thromboembolic disease following general surgery, subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  o.3ml once daily is recommended; the same dosage was used in clinical studies in bedridden medical
patients at risk for developing dvt. for prevention of dvt following orthopaedic surgery, the recommended dosages of  xxxd2690xxx  are 0.2, 0.3 and o.4ml once
daily subcutaneously for 3 days in patients weighing, respectively, <50, 50 to 69
and ~70kg; this is followed by 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6ml once daily from day 4 onwards.
drug administration should continue for at least 10 days or at least until the patient
is ambulant.
in patients with dvt,  xxxd2690xxx  0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9ml should be
administered twice daily in patients weighing <50, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79,
80 to 89 and ~90kg, respectively, for a usual duration of 10 days. preliminary
results support a similar dosage regimen for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, acute ischaemic stroke and unstable angina.
although  xxxd2690xxx  is associated with a low incidence of thrombocytopenia,
it is recommended that platelet counts be monitored twice weekly during treatment. concomitant administration of  xxxd2690xxx  and drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, ticlopidine) should be
avoided or carefully monitored when such combinations cannot be avoided. the
dosage of  xxxd2690xxx  may need to be reduced in patients with renal impairment
although no specific dosage guidelines are available.

 xxxd2690xxx  ( xxxd2690xxx ) was one of
the first low molecular weight heparins (lmwhs)
to become available for clinical use. it is prepared
by nitrous acid depolymerisation of porcine heparin and is a mixture of linear polysaccharide chains
(fig. 1).  xxxd2690xxx  has a mean molecular weight
of 4.5kd (range 1 to lokd) and 80% of the polysaccharide chains of  xxxd2690xxx  have a molecular
weight of 2.4 to 7.2kd (corresponding to 4 to 12
basic disaccharide units). this evaluation overviews
the pharmacology of  xxxd2690xxx  and considers the
clinical efficacy and tolerability of the drug in studies conducted in older patient populations.

1. overview of
pharmacodynamic properties
the pharmacology of  xxxd2690xxx  has been previously reviewed)l) this section provides an overview of the most important pharmacological data,
particularly relevant new data.
1.1 mechanism of action of
unfractionated heparin

unfractionated heparin (ufh) is a mixture of
heterogeneous polysaccharide chains with a molecular weight range of 1.2 to 40kd (mean ==15kd).[2)
the anticoagulant activity of ufh predominantly
reflects its ability to form a ternary complex with
 xxxg2056xxx  (at iii) and factor iia (thrombin),
resulting in inactivation of thrombinp-7) about
one-third of the molecules of commercial ufh
preparations contain a pentasaccharide sequence specific for at iii binding sites. a number of other
clotting factors are also inhibited by this ternary complex, including factors ixa, xa, xla and xiia as
well as plasmin and kallikrein; however, the inhibition of thrombin and  xxxg741xxx  is particularly important and clinically relevant)s)
a heparin chain length of at least 18 to 22
monosaccharide units that includes the pentasaccharide sequence specific for the at iii binding
site is required to facilitate the binding of the heparin-at iii complex to thrombin)s-l2) most molecules of ufh are at least 18 monosaccharide units
in length, whereas only a small proportion of chains

of lmwhs are long enough to bind to both thrombin and at iii. in contrast, inhibition of  xxxg741xxx 
activity requires binding only to at iii. the shorter
chain length of lmwh components is, therefore,
insufficient for formation of a ternary complex involving heparin, at iii and thrombin, but still
permits heparin-mediated at iii binding of factor
xa. in addition,  xxxg1726xxx  ( xxxg1726xxx ), released
from activated platelets, preferentially binds to heparin chains with molecular weight >5.4kd (i.e.
preferentially neutralises heparin chains with antifactor iia activity))6.13.l4) thus, as the molecular
weight of heparin decreases, its anti- xxxg741xxx  activity diminishes less rapidly than its anti-factor
iia activity.
1.2 antithrombotic profile of  xxxd2690xxx 

the in vitro potency of  xxxd2690xxx  was originally expressed in institute choay units (icu),
where 1 icu is equivalent to 0.411u. in this review,  xxxd2690xxx  dosages previously reported in
icu have been converted into iu.
the anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor iia activities
of  xxxd2690xxx  and other lmwhs have been extensively studied to define their antithrombotic and
anticoagulant effects. however, despite the introduction of the first international standard for
lmwhs by the world health organization (who)
in 1988, there is no overall scientific consensus as
to how the in vitro potency of ufh and lmwhs
may be optimally compared.(15) based on the who
standard, the mean amidolytic anti- xxxg741xxx  activity of  xxxd2690xxx  is equivalent to about 90 iv/mg
(range 85 to 110 iv/mg) and its mean anti-factor
iia activity is 27 iv/mg (data on file, sanofi

 xxxd2690xxx : a review

pharma») 15-17] according to recent european pharmacopoeia directives, the potency of anti- xxxg741xxx 
activity of lmwhs must now be evaluated in an
isolated system, i.e. without plasma; the amidolytic
anti- xxxg741xxx  activity of  xxxd2690xxx  is about 85
iv/mg (range 80 to 100 iv/mg) under these conditions (data on file, sanofi pharma). since the in
vivo antithrombotic activity of a lmwh may not be
related to its in vitro anti- xxxg741xxx  activity, the
who standard has been criticised.[l8,19] moreover,
despite having similar molecular weights (4 to
8kd), lmwhs exhibit considerable differences in
molecular structure due to variations in manufacturing processes and thus possess distinct pharmacological and biochemical profiles.[20]
 xxxd2690xxx  has a higher ratio of anti- xxxg741xxx 
to anti-factor iia activity than ufh. in vitro this ratio
is approximately 3.5 : 1 for  xxxd2690xxx  compared
with a ratio of 1 : 1 (by definition) for ufh)15,21,22]
the anti- xxxg741xxx  activity ofufh, but not lmwhs,
is reduced in the absence of calciumj23] since antifactor xa assays are commonly performed in the
absence of calcium, a spuriously high in vitro antifactor xa to anti-factor iia ratio for lmwhs compared with ufh is obtained.[23]
in vitro studies in thromboplastin-activated plasma from healthy volunteers showed that  xxxd2690xxx 
exhibits dose-proportional anti- xxxg741xxx  activity)l] in platelet-poor plasma, 55% inhibition of
thrombin generation was achieved at  xxxd2690xxx  and
ufh concentrations of 1.0 and 0.2 mg/l, respectivelyj24] at the same drug concentrations in platelet-rich plasma,  xxxd2690xxx  retained some inhibitory effect on thrombin generation but ufh did not
(27 vs 0% inhibition). the ultra-low molecular weight
fractions (<3.4kd) of  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh were
also evaluated in this study and showed similar activity in platelet-poor and platelet-rich plasma.
these results and those obtained with the synthetic
pentasaccharide that represents the at iii binding
site of heparin (which acts on free  xxxg741xxx  and is
not, or is minimally, affected by  xxxg1726xxx [25,26]) suggest
that:

• in platelet-poor plasma, the most active part of
lmwhs is found in the at iii binding fraction
with a molecular weight >5.4kd
• in platelet-rich plasma, heparin fractions with
no affinity for at iii but high affinity for  xxxg1726xxx 
protect fractions with high affinity for at iii
from neutralisation by pf4j24,27]
therefore, it appears that a portion of the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2690xxx  on thrombin generation is due to its anti- xxxg741xxx  activity, which is
less readily neutralised by  xxxg1726xxx , an observation also
made by other investigatorsj!4,16]
plasma anti- xxxg741xxx  activity increased by 2, 7
and 10%, respectively, in surgical patients after 1,
3 and 7 days' treatment with  xxxd2690xxx  3075 iv/day
and increased dose-proportionally in patients with
submassive pulmonary embolism (anti- xxxg741xxx 
activity 1.0 and 1.5 iv/ml at  xxxd2690xxx  dosages
of 164 and 246 iv/kg/day).[l]
non-at iii-dependent properties are thought to
contribute to the antithrombotic activity of  xxxd2690xxx  but the relative contribution of these actions
remains to be fully determined. these include:
• stimulation of  xxxg2266xxx 
( xxxg2266xxx ; also known as  xxxg2266xxx ) release[20,28,29]
• activation of fibrinolysis via direct release of
tissue plasminogen activator from endothelial
cells[30-35]
• modification of haemorrheological parameters
(decreased blood viscosity and increased platelet and granulocyte membrane fluidity)p6]
a number of in vivo studies in rats and rabbits
have provided evidence of the antithrombotic and/or
thrombolytic activity of  xxxd2690xxx  (reviewed by
barradell & buckley[l]). these studies generally
have shown that low doses of  xxxd2690xxx  inhibited
thrombus growth more effectively than equigravimetric doses of ufh; at higher doses both  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh decreased thrombus size. in a recent crossover study using an ex vivo model of
human venous thrombosis, the anticoagulant and
anti thrombotic effects of subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx 
and ufh were assessed in 10 healthy menp7] at
doses typically used to treat deep vein thrombosis

(dvt) [6150 and 12500iv, respectively), fibrin
deposition on stimulated endothelial cells was significantly (p ~ 0.05) reduced by  xxxd2690xxx  and
ufh at 3 hours but not at 8 hours. the generation
of markers of thrombin and fibrin formation (thrombin-at iii complexes and  xxxg784xxx , respectively) was significantly reduced by  xxxd2690xxx  and
ufh at 3 hours (by 50 to 83%), whereas only
 xxxd2690xxx  significantly inhibited these markers at
8 hours. the antithrombotic effects of both heparins correlated with their plasma anti- xxxg741xxx 
and anti-factor iia activities; these results suggest
that  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh possess similar antithrombotic activity at clinically relevant doses. the
longer lasting antithrombotic activity of  xxxd2690xxx 
relative to ufh is also in good agreement with its
pharmacokinetic properties (section 2).

2. overview of
pharmacokinetic properties
2.1 absorption, distribution and elimination

the composite molecular structure of  xxxd2690xxx 
and other heparins makes absolute determination
of their plasma concentrations impossible. thus,
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2690xxx  have
been assessed mainly on the basis of biological
activities (i.e. measurement of ex vivo amidolytic
anti- xxxg741xxx  activity). most studies to date have
been conducted in healthy volunteers and no data
are available on the effect of age on the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2690xxx . pharmacokinetic data
for single-dose  xxxd2690xxx  3075iv in 20 healthy
men are presented in table i.
mean maximum anti- xxxg741xxx  activity (amax)
of  xxxd2690xxx  41 iv/kg was higher after intravenous than after subcutaneous administration in
healthy volunteers (0.79 vs 0.25 iv/ml); wide interindividual variations in anti- xxxg741xxx  activity

6 hours after administrationj43 1 indeed, no special
coagulation tests are currently recommended for
monitoring the efficacy of lmwhs.[44] nonetheless, most of these agents produce thromboprophylactic actions for up to 24 hours, suggesting the
influence of other nonmeasurable actions of lmwhs
that modulate antithrombotic activity.l43]
early pharmacokinetic studies with low doses of
lmwhs (including  xxxd2690xxx ) showed that these
agents have a very short t';2~ of anti-factor iia activity relative to anti- xxxg741xxx  activity.[8,40,45,46] a

 xxxd2690xxx : a review

recent single-dose crossover study evaluated the
anti thrombotic activity of subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx 
by standard chromogenic assay in healthy vol unteers.[42] at daily doses used for prophylaxis (3075
and 4100iu) and treatment (92 and 185 iu/kg) of
dvt:
• amax increased dose-dependently for anti-factor
xa (0.31 to 1.55 iu/m\) and anti-factor iia (0.22
to 0.87 iu/ml) activity over the study dose range
used
• amax for anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor iia activity was achieved approximately 3 to 5 hours after drug administration
• duration of anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-factor iia activity >0.1 iu/ml was dose-dependent and lasted
for up to 19.3 and 17.2 hours, respectively, in
the  xxxd2690xxx  185 iu/kg group (fig. 2).
• mean t'l2~ of both anti- xxxg741xxx  and iia activity was approximately 4 hours.l 42 ]
the anti-factor iia activity results in this study
were verified with a more sensitive assay (plasma
thrombin neutralisation assay ; ptna) that measures the ability of heparins to catalyse the inhibition of thrombin by at iii.[42] the mean t'l2~ of
anti-factor iia activity of  xxxd2690xxx  assessed with
the ptn a was longer than when assessed by chromogenic assay (",6 vs ",4 hours). similar results were
obtained with enoxaparin at prophylactic (20 and
40mg) and therapeutic (i and 2 mg/kg) doses in
this study. [42] these data represent the first pharmacokinetic analysis of anti-factor iia activity of
lmwhs at therapeutic doses and provide a rationale for the clinical efficacy of these agents in the
treatment of venous thrombosis.[42]
the apparent volume of distribution (vd) of
single-dose  xxxd2690xxx  30751u in healthy volunteers was 6.77l (table 1))38 1 studies conducted in

other lmwhs, the primary route of elimination of
 xxxd2690xxx  is thought to involve a nonsaturable
renal mechanism,[47.48] although data to support this
are limited. in a recent study in healthy volunteers,
renal clearance accounted for only 3.9% of the total
clearance of  xxxd2690xxx  (table 1).[38] these results
indicate that  xxxd2690xxx  is metabolised in the liver
before elimination via the kidneys.
2.2 effect of renal impairment

the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2690xxx  have been
investigated in older patients (median age 52 to 61
years) with varying degrees of renal impairment
(table ii).l49] compared with healthy volunteers,
there was little difference in values for amax or vd
in patients with renal impairment, but auc and t 'l2~
were significantly increased and clearance was
significantly decreased (table ii). the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2690xxx  appeared to be independent
of the severity of renal impairment; this result
may reflect the wide interindividual variability in
the study and/or other unexplained factors that influence the elimination of  xxxd2690xxx . [49] nonetheless, these results indicate that accumulation of
 xxxd2690xxx  is possible in patients with impaired redrugs & aging 1997 apr: 10 (4)

nal function, which suggests that the drug should
be used with caution in such individuals; a dosage
reduction should also be considered, particularly in
those receiving relatively high dosages (e.g. patients with established dvt) [section 5].[49,50]

3. clinical efficacy
pulmonary embolism arising from dvt of the
lower limbs is a major cause of preventable death
in developed countries.[51,52] patients who have undergone surgery with prolonged general anaesthesia experience a period of postoperative immobility
which predisposes them to venous thromboembolism. prophylaxis is more effective for preventing
death than is treatment of established disease.
when prophylactic measures are not used, the risk
of fatal pulmonary embolism ranges from 0.1 to
0.8% in patients undergoing elective general surgery, 2 to 3% in patients undergoing elective hip
surgery, and 4 to 7% in patients undergoing surgery
for a fractured hip,!51]
the risk of venous thromboembolism depends on
a number of factors relating to the patient and the
procedure involved; age is an important independent
risk factor, as a result of physiological alterations

advancing age (reviewed by nurmohamed et al,!53]).
moreover, in older individuals there is an increased
incidence of comorbid conditions (e.g. immobility,
malignancy and surgery), which may be independently associated with an increased risk of development of thrombosis. indeed, without prophylactic
measures, dvt is reported to occur in 20 to 30%
of patients aged >40 years after major general surgery (moderate risk), increasing to approximately
50% after major orthopaedic procedures (high
risk),!54,55]
the efficacy of  xxxd2690xxx  has been evaluated
for the prevention of dvt in orthopaedic and general surgical patients and in bedridden hospitalised
medical patients. it has also been evaluated in the
treatment of established dvt, pulmonary embolism, stroke and unstable angina. many of these
studies recruited an older patient population (mean
age ~60 years) and form the basis of this section.
3,1 prophylaxis of thromboembolic events
3. 1. 1 general surgery

the majority of general surgical patients in
studies evaluating  xxxd2690xxx  underwent elective
abdominal surgery and about one-third of patients
were operated on for malignant disease. dvt was
confirmed by venography and pulmonary embolism was confirmed by perfusion ventilation scanning or angiography; initial screening with 1251_fi_
brinogen uptake leg scanning was used in 2 trials
in general surgical patients,!56,57] elastic compression stockings were used in all surgical patients
until full mobility was established. all study drugs
were administered subcutaneously unless otherwise
specified;  xxxd2690xxx  was administered once daily,
starting 2 hours before surgery, for 7 to 10 days or
until discharge. general surgical and bedridden medical patients received  xxxd2690xxx  3075iv daily and
orthopaedic surgical patients received  xxxd2690xxx 
dosages adjusted by body weight and/or time relative to procedure (range 2050 to 6150 iv/day). in
all studies, the incidence of pulmonary embolism
was similar or slightly lower for  xxxd2690xxx  than
ufh but because of the low overall incidence of

in the large, multicentre double-blind placebocontrolled studio embolia polmonare (step) study,
 xxxd2690xxx  3075 iu/day was significantly more
effective than placebo in reducing dvt, total mortality and total thromboembolic mortality (fig.
3).[60] patients in this study underwent elective general surgery with general anaesthesia lasting ~45

dvt (table iii). the incidence of proximal vein
thrombosis was also significantly lower in  xxxd2690xxx  than in ufh recipients (0.4 vs 1.4%; p < 0.05)
in 1 study that differentiated between distal and
proximal vein thromboses.f56]
in a more recent study comparing 2 lmwhs
in 185 patients undergoing general abdominal surgery, dvt was observed in significantly fewer  xxxd2690xxx  3075 iu/day than  xxxd1805xxx  2500 iu/day
recipients (table 111).[58] the lower dosage used in
the  xxxd1805xxx  compared with the  xxxd2690xxx  group
may have partly accounted for the difference in
dvt rates; increasing the dosage of  xxxd1805xxx  to
5000 iu/day reduced the rate of dvt to 14.1 % in
a non comparative study in 116 patients with a
similar risk pattern. [68] the unexpectedly high rate
of dvt in both groups in this study probably reflects the high number of patients with risk factors for thromboembolism. indeed, nearly 100% of
patients were >40 years old, nearly 50% had a
malignant neoplasm, and nearly 50% underwent a
procedure lasting >4 hours. furthermore, in contrast to the other general surgery studies in table
iii,[56,57,59] which performed venography only after
a positive doppler or 125i-fibrinogen screening test,
venography was performed on all patients by the
ninth postoperative day in this study.

 xxxd2690xxx  in the palareti study was similar to the
bodyweight- and time-adjusted dosage used in the
leyvraz et aj.l64] study, the incidence of dvt was
slightly higher (table iii). this may be partly accounted for by the fact that a number of the venographies originally classified as normal (by local
radiologists from the 7 study centres) were subsequently rated as inadequate (by the 2 independent
trial radiologists) and were excluded from the efficacy analysis.f 65 ] furthermore, a fixed dosage regimen was used for both drugs in the ghat study,[61]
whereas the leyvraz et aj.l64] study adjusted  xxxd2690xxx  dosages for body weight and time relative to
procedure (table iii) and adjusted ufh dosages to
maintain an aptt of 2 to 5 seconds above control
values. a subgroup analysis in the ghat study
indicated that the majority (",,75%) of thromboses
in the  xxxd2690xxx  group occurred in patients receiving  xxxd2690xxx  dosages s62 iv/kg and in those
weighing ~70kg.[61] thus, prophylactic  xxxd2690xxx

16.4%) and marder (28.9 vs 15.8%) venographic
scores was significantly (p < 0.05) greater for  xxxd2690xxx  than ufh recipients. during 6-month follow-up, no statistically significant differences in
the development of recurrent dvt (table iv) or
mortality rate (overall and due to pulmonary embolism) were observed between  xxxd2690xxx  and
ufh recipients.[73,75]
preliminary evidence from a recent abstract suggests that once daily  xxxd2690xxx  is as effective as
twice daily  xxxd2690xxx  in the treatment of established dvt.[76] patients received a bodyweightadjusted regimen of  xxxd2690xxx  '" 193 iv/kg/day
for a mean duration of 7 days and were followed
for 3 months. the incidence of fatal (0.6 vs 1.8%)
or nonfatal pulmonary embolism (0.9 vs 1.2%) or
dvt recurrence (2.5 vs 3.9%) was not significantly different between once daily (n = 316) and
twice daily (n = 335)  xxxd2690xxx  recipients.
in the koopman et alp3] study, patients in the
 xxxd2690xxx  group were treated at home as soon as
appropriate, either by self-injection or, if this was
not possible, injection by a relative or nurse. no
significant difference in symptomatic extension or
recurrent dvt was observed between  xxxd2690xxx 
and ufh recipients (6.9 vs 8.6%) during the 6month follow-up. importantly, only 25% of patients in the  xxxd2690xxx  group were treated entirely
in hospital, 22% were treated in hospital for <48
hours and 36% did not require hospital admission.
this had a positive effect on hospital resource use
and patient quality of life (section 3.3).

iv/kg twice daily patient groups was discontinued
prematurely because of a high incidence of major
haemorrhagic complications requiring treatment
discontinuation, transfusion or surgery (19.2% of
26 patients and 57.1 % of7 patients, respectively).
3.2.3 acute ischaemic stroke

ufh has not been conclusively shown to improve functional status or reduce mortality in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.[78-80] however,
recent evidence suggests that  xxxd2690xxx  may improve outcomes in these patients.  xxxd2690xxx  was
well tolerated in a noncomparative pilot study in
55 patients with acute ischaemic stroke[81] and,
thus, was evaluated in a randomised double-blind
placebo-controlled study in 306 older chinese patients (mean age 67 years).i 82] within 48 hours of
onset of symptoms of acute ischaemic stroke, patients received high-dosage  xxxd2690xxx  (41 ooiu twice
daily), low-dosage  xxxd2690xxx  (4100iv once daily)
or placebo for 10 days. 45, 52 and 65% of patients
in the high-dosage, low-dosage and placebo groups,
respectively, had a poor outcome (defined as death or
dependency regarding daily living activities) at 6
months; a significant (p =0.(05) dosage-dependent
trend in the reduction of poor outcomes was observed over this period. at 3 months, there was a
similar trend in favour of treated patients, but it
was not statistically significant (53, 60 and 64% of
patients, respectively, had poor outcomes); however, between 3 and 6 months, more nadroparintreated patients than placebo recipients showed
clinical improvement.

in a dosage-ranging study in 101 older patients
(mean age approximately 60 years) with acute angiography-confirmed non-massive pulmonary embolism (pulmonary vascular obstruction between 15

ufh.[77] similar decreases in pulmonary vascular

3.3 pharmacoeconomic considerations

it is accepted that use of some form of thromboembolic prophylaxis is needed to reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity in high risk surgical procedures, and studies have demonstrated the
clear economic benefit of such prophylaxis.f 84-88 ] unfortunately, there are few pharmacoeconomic analyses involving lmwhs. cost analyses based on
© adis inte rnatio nal limited . all rights reserved.

prophylaxis studies in patients undergoing elective
hip replacement[88,89] or general abdominal surgery[88] indicate that lmwhs are less costly to the
healthcare system than no prophylaxis, ufh, dextran 70 or selective treatment of dvt.
recent data from researchers in new zealand
indicated that despite higher drug acquisition costs
for lmwhs relative to ufh:[90]
• lmwhs are more cost effective than ufh for
surgical prophylaxis of dvt if the costs of failed
prophylaxis are considered
• the overall treatment costs (including those associated with treatment of pulmonary emboli and
major haemorrhages) of using subcutaneous
lmwh as therapy for established dvt are lower
than those for ufh administered as a continuous infusion
drugs & aging 1997 apr; 10 (4)

 xxxd2690xxx : a review

• the economic benefit of treatment with lmwh
becomes more pronounced when the rates of antithrombotic failure and bleeding complications
are incorporated
• the cost differential favouring lmwh for the
treatment of dvt becomes less favourable if
ufh is administered subcutaneously.
in this study, overall costs of lmwh and ufh
were calculated using recently published clinical
data and local cost information.
two studies comparing  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh in
patients (mean age 60 years) with established dvt
have included economic analysis. l73 ,91 1in a french
study, the overall treatment cost of 6 days' treatment with  xxxd2690xxx  92 iu/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours was similar to that of a continuous
intravenous infusion of ufh 30000 iu/day (dosage adjusted to maintain activated cephalin times
between 1.5 and 2.5 times control values) in 40 patients with confirmed dvt of the lower limbs (ff345
vs ff337; 1992 values).l 91 1 treatment costs were
based on drug acquisition and monitoring costs.
however, the average nursing time spent on the
delivery and monitoring of drug therapy was significantly shorter in the  xxxd2690xxx  group (42 vs
104 min/wk for ufh; p < 0.05).
in a recent study[ 73 1 in 400 patients with proximal vein thrombosis (section 3.2.1),75% of  xxxd2690xxx  recipients received some or all of their therapy on an outpatient basis. compared with ufh
(which was administered as a standard course of
therapy in hospital),  xxxd2690xxx  was associated with
considerably less hospital resource use (mean length
of stay 8.1 vs 2.7 days). this decreased use of inpatient resources was partially offset by the costs
associated with an average of 2 outpatient nursing
visits and 2.2 telephone calls per patient. unfortunately, no cost data were applied to either inpatient
or outpatient resource use.
based on medical outcome study short form-20
survey results, quality oflife significantly (p < 0.001)
improved from baseline for all indicators (e.g.
physical activity, social functioning, mental health,
thrombosis symptoms, effort to cope and overall
quality of life) over the 6-month study period.[731

315

changes over time were similar for both  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh groups with the exception of scores
for physical activity and social functioning, which
were significantly (p ::; 0.002) better in the  xxxd2690xxx  than the ufh group at the 1- to 2-week evaluation. this result is not surprising because the
quality-of-life questionnaires were designed for
evaluation of outpatients, with phrasing of questions such that simply being in hospital would tend
to produce worse patient scores, regardless of the
level of illness.l 921 nonetheless, the results of this
study are encouraging and warrant further clinical
and pharmacoeconomic evaluation of outpatient administration of  xxxd2690xxx .

4. tolerability
the major haemorrhagic complications associated with the clinical use of heparins are periand postoperative bleeding and formation of wound
haematomas. in a large study that assessed prophylaxis in 4498 general surgical patients (mean age
60 years),  xxxd2690xxx  did not significantly increase
most measures of intraoperative bleeding relative
to placebo.[60]  xxxd2690xxx  was associated with significantly (p < 0.01) higher incidences of excessive
postoperative bleeding as assessed by the surgeon
(7.7 vs 3.1 % for placebo), and wound (11.8 vs 6.3%)
and injection site (10.2 vs 6.6%) haematoma.
comparative studies of  xxxd2690xxx  and ufh used
for prophylaxis of dvt showed no significant
difference in the incidence of bleeding complications in patients who underwent general[56,571or orthopaedic surgery.l61, 641 the incidence of clinically
important bleeding was also similar with  xxxd2690xxx 
(1.5% of 330 patients) and  xxxd59xxx  (2.3%
of 342 patients) in patients who underwent elective hip or knee replacement. l631 compared with
the standard preoperative initiation of  xxxd2690xxx ,
beginning therapy postoperatively offered no clinically significant advantages in terms of bleeding
complications in patients undergoing elective hip
replacement.[65j similarly, in orthopaedic trauma patients who received prophylaxis with fixed-dosage

60 iu/kg/day)  xxxd2690xxx  for up to 6 weeks, the

incidence of major bleeding was 3.5% in both
groups.[62]
in a large trial in bedridden hospitalised medical patients (mean age 70 years), the incidence of
major and minor bleeding complications was similar (<1 %) for prophylactic treatment with subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  3075iu once daily (n = 810)
and ufh 5000iu every 8 hours (n = 780) for 10
days.[67] compared with that in the  xxxd2690xxx  group,
the incidence of subcutaneous haematoma with a
diameter >2.5cm was significantly (p = 0.0001)
higher in the ufh group (actual incidence not reported), as were the incidences of local erythema
at injection site (7.2 vs 4.1 %; p = 0.02), >3-fold
elevations in liver transaminase levels (2.7 vs
0.8% ; p = 0.01) and thrombocytopenia (platelet
count values between 40 and 80 x 109/l) [0.5 vs
0%; p = 0.05] .
data are also available from a randomised multicentre tolerability study in bedridden hospitalised
elderly patients (mean age 83 years) who received
28 days' prophylaxis with either subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  3075 iu/day (n = 146) or ufh 5000 or
7500iu twice daily (n = 149).[66j although the
overall rate of treatment withdrawal was similar for
the 2 groups, significantly fewer patients in the  xxxd2690xxx  group withdrew because of drug-related
adverse events than in the ufh group (fig. 6); i
 xxxd2690xxx  recipient withdrew because of an allergic reaction and 10 ufh recipients discontinued
therapy because of a major bleeding event such as
retroperitoneal bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding with haematemesis or melaena (n = 4), allergic
reaction (n = 3), dvt, pulmonary embolism or
thrombocytopenia (n = i each).f661 the incidence
of haemotoma was also significantly lower in the
 xxxd2690xxx  group than in the ufh group (fig. 6).

usually minor (haematoma at injection site or minor bleeding of postoperative wound) and rarely

defined as a platelet count < 100 x 109/l or a >40%
decrease during treatment, had a latency period to
onset of 5 to 12 days.
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) can
manifest as a mild transient reaction or as a severe
immunologically mediated reaction; the latter occurs in up to 5% of patients treated with ufh and
can be complicated by thrombotic events which
cause substantial morbidity and mortality.l8,93,94] hit

healthy men.[103]

5. dosage and administration
 xxxd2690xxx  is usually administered by subcutaneous injection into the anterolateral abdominal
wall but may also be administered intravenously.
in clinical practice, drug dosages are typically expressed in injection volume; the currently available
drug formulation contains 9500lu of  xxxd2690xxx 
per 1ml of solution for injection based on amidolytic anti- xxxg741xxx  activity of about 85 iv/mg
(section 1.2).[50]
in general surgical patients,  xxxd2690xxx  should
be administered in a single daily injection of 0.3ml
beginning 2 to 4 hours before surgery and continued for at least 7 days or at least until the patient
is ambulatory,f50] a similar daily dose has been administered to hospitalised bedridden medical patients at risk of developing dvt. in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, initial doses should be
given 12 hours before surgery and 12 hours after
the end of surgery; these and subsequent once daily
dosages should be adjusted according to bodyweight as outlined in table v.[50] drug administration should continue for at least 10 days or at least
until the patient is ambulant.
the bodyweight-adjusted dosages recommended
by the manufacturer for the treatment of dvt are
presented in table v. the usual duration of therapy
is 10 days. preliminary results support a similar
administration regimen for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, acute ischaemic stroke and unstable angina.
although the incidence of thrombocytopenia is
low with  xxxd2690xxx , platelet counts should be monitored before initiation of therapy and then twice
weekly thereafter,fi,50] systemic studies on drug
interactions with  xxxd2690xxx  or lmwhs in general are not available.f2°] concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or ticlopdrugs & aging 1997 apr; 10 (4)

6. place of  xxxd2690xxx  in the
management of thromboembolic
disorders in older patients
antithrombotic prophylaxis to prevent dvt after surgery is well established and is particularly important for high risk orthopaedic procedures and
for other types of major surgery when associated
risk factors (e.g. advanced age, obesity, varicose
veins, previous dvt, malignancy, underlying disease) are present. ufh has been used for the treatment of thrombosis for more than 50 years and has

more recently been used as prophylaxis of thromboembolic events.l551 however, this agent has been
associated with undesirable effects such as bleeding
and thrombocytopenia and requires aptt monitoring in many circumstances; ufh also has a relatively short elimination half-life and limited bioavailability when administered subcutaneously,
necessitating administration of 2 to 3 injections
daily.l43 1
the lmwhs were developed in an attempt to
overcome the shortcomings of ufh.  xxxd2690xxx 
was the first lmwh to become available for clinical use and as such it is an important agent. indeed, there are currently at least a dozen lmwhs
available for clinical use.[ 201clinical experience has
shown lmwhs to have advantages over dfh. these
include greater bioavailability (with longer biological half-life and less frequent administration), more
predictable anticoagulant activity and lack of need
for laboratory monitoring.[8,43,54,89,104-i081 available data seem to show equal or better efficacy for
lmwhs compared with ufh in the prophylaxis or
treatment of thromboembolic disorders but have
failed to support a reduced risk of bleeding complications.l43 ,53,54,106- 1091 in addition, the widely held
view of a reduced risk of thrombocytopenia with
lmwhs relative to ufh has yet to be confirmed
in a well-designed study.
once daily subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  is effective
for the prevention of dvt and pulmonary embolism following orthopaedic or general surgery, and
in elderly bedridden medical patients. in these contexts,  xxxd2690xxx  was at least as effective as ufh
and  xxxd1805xxx  in general surgical patients, ufh
and oral  xxxd59xxx  in orthopaedic surgical
patients, and ufh in bedridden medical patients.
no significant differences in bleeding complications were noted between  xxxd2690xxx  and comparators in surgical patients. in elderly bedridden
medical patients,  xxxd2690xxx  was associated with a
significantly lower incidence of local reactions, elevated transaminase levels, thrombocytopenia and
treatment withdrawals because of adverse events
than ufh.

n adroparin calcium: a review

a bodyweight-adjusted dosage of subcutaneous
 xxxd2690xxx  was at least as effective as dose-adjusted
intravenous ufh in the treatment of dvt. preliminary evidence suggests that treatment with once
daily  xxxd2690xxx  is as effective as the same dosage
of  xxxd2690xxx  administered twice daily in patients
with dvt. 75% of  xxxd2690xxx  recipients in 1 study
were able to complete their drug treatment as outpatients, indicating an advantage for  xxxd2690xxx  over
intravenous ufh (which requires hospitalisation
and frequent monitoring and dosage adjustment).
preliminary results with  xxxd2690xxx  in the treatment
of pulmonary embolism, acute ischaemic stroke and
unstable angina are encouraging and further investigations in these areas are warranted.
the higher acquisition costs of lmwhs compared with ufh have led to concerns for purchasers that the use of these drugs may have serious
implications
for
healthcare
budgets.[lio]
pharmacoeconomic studies of lmwhs are limited
but recent data indicate that despite their higher
acquisition costs, lmwhs are more cost effective
than ufh for prophylaxis or treatment of dvt,
particularly when the costs associated with treatment failure are considered. overall treatment
costs (drug acquisition and monitoring costs) were
similar for subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  and intravenous ufh in a french study in patients with dvt.
outpatient treatment of dvt with  xxxd2690xxx  resulted in considerably less hospital resource use
than ufh but, as expected, was associated with increased outpatient resource use. unfortunately, the
costs associated with inpatient and outpatient
resource use were not quantified and therefore limited conclusions can be drawn from these results.
anticoagulant therapy represents a compromise
between prevention of thrombosis and impairment
of haemostasis, and the use of lmwhs is no exception. in studies conducted in most older patient
populations, subcutaneous  xxxd2690xxx  has been
shown to be an effective and well tolerated drug
for the prevention of dvt and pulmonary embolism in general and orthopaedic surgical and in
bedridden medical patients, and for the treatment
of established dvt.  xxxd2690xxx  also has poten© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

tial for the treatment of pulmonary embolism,
acute ischaemic stroke and unstable angina in
this patient population. more well-designed trials
are needed to clearly define its advantages over
ufh in terms of efficacy, tolerability (particularly
bleeding complications) and cost effectiveness. in
addition, comparisons with other agents (especially
other lmwhs) are required to define the relative
place of  xxxd2690xxx  in the management of thromboembolic disorders. the ease of administration
and reduced need for laboratory monitoring of
lmwhs, including  xxxd2690xxx , are undisputed advantages of these agents compared with ufh, and
both may have positive cost implications.
in summary,  xxxd2690xxx  is at least as effective
and as well tolerated as standard anti thrombotic
agents in older patients. available clinical and tolerability data support its use over ufh,  xxxd1805xxx 
and oral  xxxd59xxx  for the prevention ofdvt
in surgical patients, over ufh for the prevention
of dvt in bedridden patients, and over ufh for
the treatment of established dvt.  xxxd2690xxx  is,
therefore, an effective, well tolerated, and easily
administered and monitored anti thrombotic agent
for the prophylaxis and treatment of dvt in older
patients.
