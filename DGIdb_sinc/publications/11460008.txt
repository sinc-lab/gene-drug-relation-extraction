in vitro interaction of c1-inhibitor with thrombin.  previous observations of increased generation of thrombin during acute attacks of angioedema in plasma of patients with c1-inhibitor ( xxxd1746xxx ) deficiency prompted us to evaluate the interaction of  xxxd1746xxx  with thrombin in both purified systems and human plasma. for this purpose, we used several methods: (1)  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis; (2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure complexes between  xxxd1746xxx  and thrombin and inactivated  xxxd1746xxx ; and (3) kinetic studies using a chromogenic assay. we found that the interaction of purified  xxxd1746xxx  with thrombin is associated with the formation of bimolecular complexes of molecular weight (mr) 130 000 and 120 000 as well as with the appearance of a cleaved form of  xxxd1746xxx  of mr 97 000. the kinetic studies of inhibition of thrombin by  xxxd1746xxx  showed an average second-order rate constant of 19/s per mol/l, which was significantly increased in the presence of heparin. the addition of thrombin to human plasma was not associated with detectable  xxxd1746xxx -thrombin complex formation or with cleavage of  xxxd1746xxx . in conclusion, our data demonstrate that  xxxd1746xxx  upon interaction with thrombin, in part, forms enzyme-inhibitor complexes and, in part, is cleaved. the low second-order rate constant and the lack of a significant interaction in plasma suggest that the inhibition of thrombin by  xxxd1746xxx  has a minor role in circulating blood; however, its role might be important at the endothelial surface, where high concentrations of glycosaminoglycans occur.
