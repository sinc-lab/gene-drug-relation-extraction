abstract-rat liver plasma membrane contains a saturable, high affinity binding site for the labelled
histamine hi-antagonist [3h] xxxd3050xxx . nonlinear regression analysis of the performed saturation

experiments revealed an equilibrium dissociation constant (i&) of 7.7 f 0.4 nm and a maximal binding
capacity (b,,) of 70.4 + 9.5 pmol/mg protein. specific binding could be inhibited completely by several
histaminergic ligands. however, the affinities of the tested h,-antagonists other than  xxxd3050xxx  for
this binding site were quite low and the known stereospecificity displayed by the histamine hi-receptor
for the enantiomers of chlorpheniramine and  xxxd2906xxx  was not found. moreover, the hz-selective
agonist 4-methylhistamine (k, = 412 fl) was even more potent than its h,-selective 2-methylderivative
(k, = 772 pm). since several ethylenediamines were also very potent in displacing [3h] xxxd3050xxx  we
suggest the presence of an ethylenediamine recognition site on rat liver plasma membrane which is
unrelated to the histamine h,-receptor. it is stressed that a proper harmacological characterization of
a reported binding site is needed, since we show in this study that [phlmepyramine, which is frequently
used in studies concerning the hi-receptor, labels non-hi-receptor binding sites in rat liver plasma
membrane.
histamine is one of the physiological mediators,
which is possibly implicated in the regulation of the
metabolic activity of the liver. recently, garciasainz et al. showed that histamine stimulated three
major metabolic pathways (glycogenolysis,
gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis) in isolated rat hepatocytes [l]. these effects were suggested to be
mediated via both the ca2+-mobilizing h1- and the camp generating hz-receptor, since the effects were
partially stimulated by the hi-agonist 2-thiazolylethylamine and the hz-agonist impromidine
and
partially inhibited by the hi-antagonist  xxxd3050xxx 
and the h2-antagonist cimetidine.
another approach for investigating
receptormediated processes is the use of labelled compounds
to study drug-receptor interaction or to study alterations in receptor densities and/or affinities after processes like desensitization
or membrane damage.
however, as recently stated by laduron, receptor
binding has led to a controversial multiplication of
receptor subtypes [2]. he summarized several criteria
for receptor sites. besides a high affinity, a reversibility, a saturability, a stereospecificity and a displacement of binding with drugs of a different
chemical class, a functional correlation between binding data and pharmacological activity is an absolute
requirement for a receptor site [2].
the most commonly used radioligand for the h,receptor is [3h] xxxd3050xxx .
in 1977 hill et al.
described
saturable,
high affinity binding
of
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  to h,-receptors in homogenates of

the longitudinal muscle preparation of guinea-pig
ileum [3]. the specific binding could be displaced by
several non-labelled
hi-antagonists
and data
obtained in these studies showed a good correlation
with results obtained from isolated organ studies. in
radioligand binding studies concerning the h1-receptor [3h] xxxd3050xxx  is currently considered as first
choice as radiolabel.
previously imoto et al. [4] showed the presence of
high affinity, saturable binding of [3h] xxxd3050xxx 
and [3h]cimetidine to rat liver plasma membrane
preparation. according to the authors these observations suggested the presence of both h1- and h2receptors on rat liver plasma membranes. a remarkable result of this study was the huge density (pmol
amounts/mg protein) of [“hlmepyramine
binding
sites in this preparation. thereafter the same group of
investigators extended the study of [3h] xxxd3050xxx 
binding to isolated rat hepatocytes and found again a
saturable, high affinity [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site
with an extremely high maximal binding capacity [5].
however, in both studies a proper pharmacological
identification of this [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site was
not provided [4,5].
in the present study we identify this [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding-site on rat liver plasma membranes
as a non-hi-receptor
site, using stereoselective hiantagonists, several  xxxd3050xxx  analogues and selective histaminergic agonists.

plasma membrane preparation

male wistar rats (200-240 g, harlan cpb, zeist,
the netherlands) were killed by decapitation. livers
were quickly removed and homogenized in 3 vol. icecold 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm tris-hci (ph = 8.0 at
4”) by three lo-set bursts of a polytron homogenizer
and a subsequent homogenization with a glass-teflon
homogenizer. this homogenate was layered on top of
20 ml 2.0 m sucrose, 50 mm tris-hcl (ph = 8.0 at
4”) and centrifuged for 60 min at 80,000 g at 4”. plasma
membranes were obtained from the interface of the
two sucrose solutions and homogenized in 50 mm
tris-hcl, 10 mm mgclz (ph = 7.4 at 4”). after centrifugation for 30 min at 80,000 g at 4” membranes
were homogenizedin
mmtris-hcl, 10 mmmgc&

( ph = 7.4 at 37”), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80” until further use. plasma membrane purity
was assessed by measuring 5’-nucleotidase- and na+/
k+-atpase activity and usually yielded a four-fold
enrichment of enzyme activity (data not shown).

binding studies

membrane protein (200 pg/ml) was incubated with
the radioligand for 20 min at 37” in 50 mm tris-hcl,
10 mm mgc12 (ph = 7.4 at 37”) in a total volume of
200 ~1. in the saturation experiments increasing concentrations of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  (0.1-40 nm) were
incubated in the presence or absence of 10 pm l-chlorpheniramine to determine the non-specific binding.
in the displacement studies approximately
1 nm
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  was incubated with increasing concentrations of non-labelled compounds. incubations
were performed in triplicate and started by the
addition of 50 ~1 protein. the incubations were terminated by the addition of 3 ml ice-cold 50 mm trishcl, 10 mm mgclz (ph = 7.4 at 4”) and rapid filtration under vacuum through glass filters (whatman
gf/c, whatman international
ltd, maidstone,
u.k.). the tubes were rinsed once with another 3 ml
buffer and the filters were subsequently washed twice
with 3 ml buffer. filters were placed in 20 ml polyethylene scintillation vials, dried for 20min at 60”
whereafter 5 ml dynagel scintillation fluid (j. t.
baker chemicals b.v., deventer, the netherlands)
was added. all samples were counted for 10 min in a
mark iii scintillation spectrometer (model 6880,
searle analytic inc., des plaines, u.s.a.) with an
efficiency of 45-50%.
the binding data were evaluated by using the nonlinear curve fitting program ligand [7] on a zenith
z-110 microcomputer. this program is based on the
first-order mass action law for multiple binding sites
and provides a correction for free ligand concentration and non-specific binding. fits for multiple
binding sites were considered significantly best when
the p-value for a binding site was smaller than 0.05.
binding data from the displacement studies were
evaluated by simultaneous fitting of several independent experiments.
tissue bath studies

male guinea-pigs (350-450 g) were killed by a blow
on the head. ileal segments (* 10 mm long) were
mounted in 20 ml krebs-buffer (117.5 mm naci,
5.6mm kcl, 1.18 mm mgso,, 2.5 mm caclz,
1.28mm nah2p04,
25 mm nahc03,
5.5 mm
glucose), continuously gassed with 95% oz-5% co*
and maintained at 37”. contractions were recorded
isotonically under 0.4 g tension. antagonists were
equilibrated for 10 min whereafter a new histamine
dose-response curve was obtained.
protein determination

the protein determinations
were performed
according to bradford [8], using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.

fig. 1. saturation experiment for [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding to rat liver plasma membrane at 37”. nonspecific binding (0) was determined in the presence of 10 ,um i-chlorpheniramine. specific binding (0)
was determined by subtracting the non-specific binding from the total binding (0). a typical experiment
out of three is shown. inset shows the transformation of the data into a scatchard plot.

with increasing amounts of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  in the
absence or presence of 10 pm i-chlorpheniramine
to
define non-specific binding, the obtained specific
binding was saturable and showing a high affinity
and high capacity for [3h] xxxd3050xxx 
(fig. 1).
analysis of the binding data by nonlinear regression
revealed the presence of a single binding site for
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  with an equilibrium dissociation
constant (&) of 7.7 + 0.4 nm and a maximal binding
capacity (b,,,& of 70.4 + 9.5 pmol/mg protein (se,
n = 3). fits of the saturation experiments according
to a two binding site model were not significantly
better (p > 0.05). transformation
of the specific
binding into a scatchard plot resulted in a linear
relationship (inset fig., 1) with a kcvalue of 9.3 +
0.9 nm and a &,-value
of 76.1 _’ 7.7 pmol/mg protein (se, n = 3). analysis of the data using a hill
plot gave a hill coefficient close to unity (nn =
0.99 + o.ol), also indicating an interaction according
to a one binding site model.
in order to characterize this [3h] xxxd3050xxx  high
affinity, high capacity binding site on rat liver plasma
membranes we performed some displacement studies
with several hi-antagonists and histaminergic hr- and
hz-agonists. specific binding of 1 nm [3h]- xxxd3050xxx  was completely inhibited by the studied hrantagonists (fig. 2a) and the histaminergic agonists
(fig. 2b). analysis of the displacement curves of both
antagonists and agonists revealed hill-coefficients not
significantly different from unity (nu = 0.91-1.14),
indicating an interaction with a single binding site.
the ic,, values obtained from the simultaneous fit of
independent competition experiments were transformed into the corresponding inhibition constants
(ki). table 1 shows that specific binding of
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  is potently inhibited by non-labelled
 xxxd3050xxx  (ki = 4.9 nm). however, thepotenthiantagonist triprolidine is less effective in displacing

krvalues (t sd) on liver plasma membrane were determined by simultaneous fitting of three
independent experiments and were calculated from the respective rc,-values using the formula
k, = ic~,,/(~+ [l]/k,),
in which [l] is the concentration [3h] xxxd3050xxx  and k,, is the dissociation constant of [‘hlmepyramine. ks-values on the guinea-pig ileum were obtained by
transformation of the pa,-values to geometric values.

triprolidine but is also displayed by the other tested
hi-antagonists d- and i-chlorpheniramine
and d- and
i- xxxd2906xxx  (table 1, fig. 2a). besides their low
affinity for this [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site the lack
of a proper stereospecificity for the two pair of enantiomers is remarkable. as can be seen in fig. 2a the lisomer of chlorpheniramine is more potent in displacing [3h] xxxd3050xxx  than the d-isomer, whereas on
hi-receptor
preparations
d-chlorpheniramine
is
usually a factor 100 more potent than its corresponding f-isomer. the same phenomenon is apparent for the two isomers of the analogue  xxxd2906xxx 
(table 1).
we also tested several structural analogues of
 xxxd3050xxx 
for their inhibitory activity in the
[3h] xxxd3050xxx 
binding assay. all tested compounds were able to displace [3h] xxxd3050xxx  and
the obtained displacement curves all showed hillcoefficients not significantly different from unity
(nu = 0.94-1.11). as can be seen in table 2 the
methyl-analogue of  xxxd3050xxx  (vuf 7658) is very
potent in displacing [3h] xxxd3050xxx  (ki = 3.2 nm).
vuf 7621, in which the 2-pyridyl ring of  xxxd3050xxx 
is replaced by a phenyl-ring, is also a very active
displacer (kj = 15.0 nm), whereas vuf 7628, in
which not only the 2-pyridyl ring is replaced by
a phenyl-ring but the p-methoxybenzyl
has been
replaced by the corresponding phenyl group, shows
a much weaker potency (ki = 140 nm). in case of
the  xxxd3050xxx  analogues the potency order for the

inhibition of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding to liver plasma
membrane is qualitatively the same as for the inhibition of histamine induced contraction of guineapig ileum, although it is remarkable that in the case
of wf
7628 a selectivity towards the hepatic
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site is encountered for the
first time.
besides hr-antagonists, ’ histaminergic
agonists
were tested too for their inhibitory potency to displace
[3h] xxxd3050xxx 
binding. figure 2b shows the
obtained displacement curves for histamine, the hzselective agonist 4-methylhistamine and the hr-selective agonist 2-methylhistamine. it is clear that none of
these compounds is very potent in displacing
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding; the k,-values are in the
range of 0.1-l mm (table 1). histamine is the most
potent of the histamine analogues, whereas the hzselective agonist 4-methylhistamine is slightly more
potent than 2-methylhistamine.
discussion

in the present study we investigated the binding
characteristics
of
previously
reported
the
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site on rat liver plasma
membrane. in 1977 [3h] xxxd3050xxx  was introduced
by hill as a radioligand for the study of the histamine
hr-receptor [3]. the specific binding in homogenate
of guinea-pig ileal smooth muscle was found to be
saturable, with a high affinity and a good correlation
with data from organ studies was found; the estab-

k,-values (2 sd) on liver plasma membrane were determined by simultaneous fitting of
three independent experiments and were calculated from the respective icso-values using the
formula k, = ~q,,/(l + [l]/k,), in which [l] is the concentration [3h] xxxd3050xxx  and kd is
the dissociation constant of [‘hlmepyramine. kb-values on the guinea-pig ileum are the
mean f sd of three indeoendent determinations and were obtained by transformation of the
paz-values to geometric balues.

lished stereospecificity of the [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding sites towards the isomeric chlorpheniramines
in
several tissue preparations (e.g. porcine airways [lo]
andguinea-pig and rat brain [9,12]) further convinced
workers in the histamine
research field that
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  was a suitable ligand for labelling
histamine hi-receptors. currently [3h] xxxd3050xxx 
is the most commonly used radioligand for the hireceptor.
in 1985 imoto et al. described the presence of two
binding sites for [3h] xxxd3050xxx  on rat liver plasma
membrane [4]; a high affinity (kd = 4.2 nm) binding
site with a remarkably high binding capacity (b,, =
4.7 pmol/mg protein) and a secondary, low affinity
binding site (kd = 21.3 nm, b,, = 16 pmol/mg protein). two years later this study was extended to
isolated rat hepatocytes by tsuchie et al., resulting in
the confirmation of the results obtained with plasma
membrane
[5]. moreover,
recently this [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site was even purified and solubilized from rat liver membranes [13]. in this study
only one binding site (kd = 19 nm) could be solubilized and target size analysis of this binding protein
revealed a molecular mass of 162 kda, confirming
the previous results of wang et al. [14]. these
authors observed a molecular mass of hepatic
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding sites of various species to
range from 107-162 kda [14]. the observed value
for the rat hepatic [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site
(162 kda [ 13,141) is close to the previously reported
value of 155 kda and 157 kda for hi-receptors in
human and bovine cerebra1 cortex, respectively [ 151.
however, it should be stated that those above-mentioned values for molecular mass were all determined
using target size analysis. recently ruat et al. used
a different approach [16]. by using the photoaffinity
label [ 12si]-iodoazidophenpyramine
these authors
showed that the ligand binding domain of the hireceptor of guinea-pig cerebellar membranes probably resides within  xxxg220xxx  of 56 kda, whereas the
native hi-receptor probably has a molecular mass of
350-400 kda [16].
classical hi-antagonists
were quite inactive in

displacing [3h] xxxd3050xxx  from the solubilized hepatic binding site and the authors suggested the presence of a hi-receptor subtype on rat liver plasma
membrane [13]. since we are interested in the use
of isolated rat hepatocytes as a model system for the
study of hi-receptor dynamics we tried to characterize this reported [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site
on rat liver plasma membrane, using stereoselective
hi-antagonists and some histaminergic agonists.
the results of the performed saturation experiments on rat liver plasma membrane in this study
confirm the reported findings of imoto, tsuchie et
al. [4,5]; a high affinity (kd = 7.73nm)
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site with a high maximal binding
capacity (b,,, = 70.4 pmol/mg protein). the difference in b,, -value can be explained by the use
of another protein determination,
whereas also a
different way of preparation of plasma membranes
might result in this higher b,,-value.
this later
suggestion is supported by the fact that we were not
able to find the reported secondary, low affinity
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site in our plasma membrane preparation.
however, results of displacement studies with several hi-antagonists
clearly show that the binding
characteristics
of [3h] xxxd3050xxx 
on rat liver
plasma membrane
do not meet the commonly
accepted characteristics for [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding
to h,-receptors. as shown in table 1 triprolidine is
in displacing
less active
than
 xxxd3050xxx 
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  from rat liver plasma membrane.
this is in marked contrast to its activity on hireceptor preparations. for the inhibition of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding to guinea-pig cerebellar membranes by triprolidine ki-values similar to  xxxd3050xxx  are found, whereas for the inhibition of
histamine induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum
triprolidine is even more potent than  xxxd3050xxx 
(table 1). this dissimilarity between the potencies
in the different test systems is also apparent for the
tested pheniramines. moreover, the stereospecificity
towards the  xxxd2906xxx  enantiomers displayed by
the hepatic [ hlmepyramine binding site is not com-

parable to the one found for the hi-receptor.
whereas in ht-receptor systems d-chlorpheniramine
is usually a hundred times more potent than the lisomer in inhibiting ht-receptor responses, the lisomer is more potent in displacing [3h] xxxd3050xxx 
binding on rat liver plasma membranes, suggesting
completely different stereochemical demands.
the observations obtained with the hi-antagonists
were further supported by the data found with the
histaminergic agonists. all agonists tested were relatively inactive as displacer and the hz-selective agonist 4-methylhistamine
was even more potent than
the hi-selective agonist 2-methylhistamine.
these
results strongly suggest the presence of a non-hireceptor binding site (uide in@) or a hi-receptor
subtype on rat liver plasma membrane.
since one of the main structural differences
between  xxxd3050xxx 
(ethylenediamine),
triprolidine (alkene) and  xxxd2906xxx  (alkane) is the connection of the aromatic head to the dimethylamino
group (table l), we used some  xxxd3050xxx  analogues to study the possibility of an ethylenediamine
binding site on rat liver plasma membrane. table 2
shows that all tested compounds were more potent
in displacing 13h] xxxd3050xxx  than triprolidine and
that structural manipulation of the aromatic head in
the molecule can lead to changes in displacing
activity. in contrast to the other hi-antagonists the
displacing activity of the wf-compounds
parallels
the inhibitory action on the guinea-pig ileum,
although in the case of vuf 7628 selectivity towards
the hepatic [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site is obtained.
these results might suggest that on rat liver plasma
membrane
[3h] xxxd3050xxx 
labels an ethylenediamine binding site which is distinct from the h1receptor. such a phenomenon has also been shown
for t3h]cimetidine, which has been shown to label
an imidazole binding site instead of the hz-rece tor
[17]. the affinity of histamine
for this [ phimepyramine binding site is very low (ki = 0.12 mm),
whereas garcia-sainz
et al. reported ec,,,-values for
histamine of approximately
0.2 pm for stimulation

of glycogenolysis , glyconeogenesis and ureagenesis
in isolated rat hepatocytes [l]. therefore we do not
consider this [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site as a novel
histaminergic receptor, although the presence of a
receptor reserve for histamine for stimulation of
glycogenolysis,
glyconeogenesis
and ureagenesis
cannot be excluded. the presence of a receptor
reserve would mean that the ki-value is expected to
be lower than the ecsa-value.
in conclusion, results of this study confirm the
presence of a saturable,
high affinity [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding site on rat liver plasma membrane
but show that it is unrelated to the classical htreceptor, since it does not fulfil the criteria described
by laduron [2]. this conclusion is based on the
finding that this binding site has a low affinity for
several structural non-related hi-antagonists, has a
high affinity for several ethylenediamine derivatives,
shows stereochemical requirements different from
the hi-receptor and has a very low affinity for histaminergic agonists. therefore, although histamine
hi-receptors, involved in the regulation of metabolic
activity, seem to be present on rat hepatocytes [l]
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  is not a suitable radioligand for

labelling these receptors.
