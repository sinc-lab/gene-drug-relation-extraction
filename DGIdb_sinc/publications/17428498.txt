 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  ( xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx ) is a functionally dimeric ligase,
which specifically couples hydrolysis of atp to amp and pyrophosphate
to the formation of an ester bond between tryptophan and the cognate
trna.  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  from bacillus stearothermophilus binds the atp analogue,
adenosine-5′ tetraphosphate (aqp) competitively with atp during
pyrophosphate exchange. estimates of binding affinity from this
competitive inhibition and from isothermal titration calorimetry show
that aqp binds 200 times more tightly than atp both under conditions of
induced-fit, where binding is coupled to an unfavorable conformational
change, and under exchange conditions, where there is no conformational
change. these binding data provide an indirect experimental measurement of + 3.0 kcal/mol for the conformational free energy change
associated with induced-fit assembly of the active site. thermodynamic
parameters derived from the calorimetry reveal very modest enthalpic
changes, consistent with binding driven largely by a favorable entropy
change. the 2.5 å structure of the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :aqp complex, determined de
novo by x-ray crystallography, resembles that of the previously described,
pre-transition state  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :atp complexes. the anticodon-binding domain
untwists relative to the rossmann-fold domain by 20% of the way toward
the orientation observed for the products complex. an unexpected
tetraphosphate conformation allows the gamma and deltad phosphate groups to
occupy positions equivalent to those occupied by the beta and gamma phosphates
of atp. the beta-phosphate effects a 1.11 å extension that relocates the alphaphosphate toward the tryptophan carboxylate while the ppi mimic moves
deeper into the kmsks loop. this configuration improves interactions
between enzyme and nucleotide significantly and uniformly in the
adenosine and ppi binding subsites. a new hydrogen bond forms
between s194 from the class i kmsks signature sequence and the ppi
mimic. these complementary thermodynamic and structural data are all
consistent with the conclusion that the tetraphosphate mimics a
transition-state in which the kmsks loop develops increasingly tight
bonds to the ppi leaving group, weakening linkage to the palpha as it is
relocated by an energetically favorable domain movement. consistent
with extensive mutational data on  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx , this aspect
of the mechanism develops high transition-state affinity for the adenosine

introduction
because of its widespread use in biosynthetic, biomechanical, and regulatory processes, nucleophilic
substitution at phosphoryl groups is among the
most studied bimolecular reactions in biology.1
uncatalyzed rates of phosphoryl-solvolysis are
quite slow, in the range of 10− 5/min, and bimolecular reactions such as amino acid activation are
slower, about 10− 8/mol per min.2 metal ions (mg2+)
accelerate these rates by only perhaps three-fold.1,3
understanding the relative roles of general acid or
base catalysis, emerging charge stabilization,
mechanical distortion, and other catalytic effects in
enzyme mechanisms that accelerate this reaction
1010–1014-fold requires characterization of the transition state in relation to the ground state(s). phosphoryl transfer is usually described with reference to
two extreme transition-state configurations: a fully
dissociative, sn1-like mechanism and a fully associative, sn2-like mechanism (figure 1;1,4–6). these
extremes are distinguished by the extent to which
the nucleophile and leaving group participate in
bond-making and bond-breaking. in transition
states with dissociative character, the bond to the
leaving group is weakened or broken first, while in
those with associative character, the approach of the
nucleophile is strengthened before the bond to the
leaving group weakens.

figure 1. limiting transition states for phosphoryltransfer reactions involving nucleophilic displacement at
palpha of atp.1 the relationship between the structure of
adenosine tetraphosphate and a dissociative transition
state is based on the potential equivalence of the gamma and
delta-phosphates to the beta and gamma-phosphates of the ppi leaving
group (ellipse).

participation of both bond-making and bondbreaking processes leads in general to a continuous,
two-dimensional surface.5 this surface is characterized by approximately equal barrier heights along
many different possible trajectories, any of which
might be stabilized by a variety of different interactions with enzymatic active sites,6 making it difficult
to assess which path is taken by a particular enzyme.
the amino acid activation step catalyzed by class i
aminoacyl-trna synthetases (aars), in which the
leaving group is inorganic pyrophosphate instead of
phosphate, deserves renewed attention in this
context. the amino acid activation mechanism has
been extensively studied by site-directed mutagenesis and pre-steady-state kinetics,7–10 and by crystallographic methods.9,11–21 however, despite these
efforts, mechanistic descriptions have been limited
to modelling in-line displacement of the ppi leaving
group by the alpha-carboxylate of the amino acid
without identifying specific interactions that
develop in the transition-state complexes.
most enzymes that catalyze phosphoryl transfer
and which have been characterized structurally,
exhibit significant potential transition-state complementarity to a pentavalent phosphate group, consistent with associative character. in contrast, the
class i bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-trna
synthetase ( xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx ) structural reaction profile 11–13,15
suggests a different transition state with dissociative character. first, active site residues do not
appear to provide specific interactions capable of
differentiating between ground-state and transition-state configurations of the alpha-phosphate. second, those catalytic residues identified by mutation
of the closely related  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  active site interact either
with the ribose or the pyrophosphate moieties.8
finally,  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  catalysis is associated with a large
domain rearrangement between the pre-transition
state (prets) and products structures, in which the
pyrophosphate binding site formed by the kmsks
loop relocates by ∼ 1.6 å. the relative absence of
interactions to the alpha-phosphate, the abundance of
distributed catalytic interactions to the adenosine
and pyrophosphate moieties, and the implication
that the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  transition state occurs during
dynamic domain movement consistently point to
a novel mechanism to stabilize the phosphoryltransfer transition state involved in amino acid
activation by  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx ,  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx , and perhaps class i
aars in general.
one effective way to characterize enzymatic
transition states structurally is to mimic them with
stable compounds, or transition-state analog inhibitors.22 transition state mimics are a mixed blessing.
on the one hand, it is impossible in principal to

110
imitate precisely in a stable analog the geometry and
electron distributions of a transition state which, by
definition is the least stable, and hence shortest-lived
species along a reaction path.23 for this reason all
such analogs mimic only a subset of the features of
the actual transition state. the descriptive phrase,
transition-state analog, therefore evokes a variety of
interpretations, and examples of compounds designated as transition-state mimics approach the transition state more or less adequately.
on the other hand, such inhibitors can provide
useful, approximate structural models. when they
can be crystallized with the enzymes they inhibit,
interactions that strengthen in the transition state
complex and possibly accelerate the reaction rate
can be identified. thus, such analogs provide a
valuable link between structure and function.
the validity of inferences drawn from structural
analogs of transition states depends on several
criteria expected for such complexes.22,24 first, the
compounds themselves should capture stably some
distinctive aspect (geometry, charge distribution,
polarity) of the altered substrate configuration in the
transition state. second, their affinities should
substantially exceed those for the substrates they
mimic. third, to attribute the increased affinity to
transition-state-like features, enzyme:transitionstate-analog complex structures should reveal
strengthening of interactions already present in the
binding of substrates, together with new interactions evoked by those parts of the analogs that
mimic changes in the transition state. fourth, it is
also reasonable that the active site will intensify the
physical enclosure of the analog and limit the access
of solvent, relative to what is observed for substrates. finally, experimental variables that alter the
enzymatic rate acceleration should have parallel
effects on the analog binding affinity.
we describe here experiments with the atp
analog, adenosine tetraphosphate (aqp). the affinity and crystal structure of a  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :aqp complex
appear to meet each of the first four criteria.
moreover, protein engineering experiments to identify a minimal, functionally active  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  catalytic
domain, mcd2 suggest an important experimental
test along the lines of the fifth criterion. these data
provide a novel and coherent structural representation of the distributed interactions by which class ic
enzymes use binding energy for catalysis, first
outlined experimentally by fersht and co-workers7,8
who showed that catalytically relevant interactions
occur throughout the surface of the nucleotide.7,8

results
aqp binding affinity
competitive inhibition
aqp is not a substrate; it does not support
incorporation of [32p]pyrophosphate into adenine
nucleotide (we did not test for its ability to generate

 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :aqp: distributed transition state binding

acylated trnatrp). it is an inhibitor, competitive
with atp. the inhibition constant, measured by
steady-state kinetics, is 2.0 mm.
although ki is a true thermodynamic dissociation
constant, several considerations condition its interpretation. aqp, like atp, has a high affinity for mg2+,
which is present in excess under the assay conditions. yet, as described below, the bound form of
aqp does not contain mg2+. nor are there any water
molecules near the ligand that might represent this
ion. the binding equilibrium leading to inhibition is
therefore coupled to an equilibrium in solution
between aqp and mg2+ aqp that heavily favors
the complexed form, so that the concentration of the
uncomplexed aqp is very much smaller than ki (see,
for example, frick et al.25). put another way, the
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx –aqp interaction is strong enough to compete
with the aqp–mg2+ interaction. thus, as the ki is
based on the total aqp concentration in the assay
rather than that of the uncomplexed form, a correct
estimate for the affinity, ki*, requires estimating the
concentration of free aqp in the assay from the
dissociation constant for the mg2+ aqp complex in
solution:

·

·

we estimate the mg2+ aqp dissociation constant
following26 to be, ∼ 2.18 × 10− 6 m†. under this
assumption, the actual concentration of uncomplexed aqp at half-saturation is ∼ 2.2 mum.
isothermal titration calorimetry (itc)
titrations of two  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  concentrations (6 mum and
60 mum) were carried out with aqp in the absence of
mg2+. data were fitted to a sequential binding
model with two different kinds of binding sites27 as
described in experimental procedures (figure 2(a)).
calorimetric determinations were noisy, owing to
the small enthalpy changes and the limiting amount
of aqp that we had synthesized. use of two
different protein concentrations sharply constrained
the combinations of binding affinity and binding
enthalpy parameters (table 1) that would fit both
curves simultaneously, reducing their uncertainty to
less than 5%. dissociation constants for the two
successive aqp molecules are 18 mum and 40 mum,
respectively.
† these calculations make several assumptions, extrapolating conservatively from the values given by adolfson and moudrianakis26 for the intrinsic affinity of mg for
adp (12,000) and atp (140,000) and the mu values (1.5
and 3.1, respectively), to values of 800,000 and 3.8,
respectively. these two values are highly correlated. so,
this extrapolation is subject to revision by experimental
data that we cannot provide without synthesizing more
aqp.

finities of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  for atp11 (figure 2(b)). in particular,
aqp affinity is stronger by 200-fold both in exchange
and in induced-fit binding processes, which have
been determined for both nucleotides.
as the enthalpy changes associated with successive binding events are rather small, ± ∼1 kcal/mol,
aqp binding is largely entropy-driven (table 1).
this result is consistent with the large reduction in
the entropy of water molecules that results from
dissolution of polyphosphates into water.29 the
binding affinity for both adenine nucleotides therefore likely results from replacing water molecules
bound to the phosphate groups with protein sidechains. the structural results also suggest that the
differential binding affinity for aqp, relative to atp,
arises largely from an increase in the number and
strength of such hydrogen-bonded interactions and
the release of water molecules bound to the
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  atp complex in the case of aqp.

into assembled active sites measured by ppi exchange
(ki for aqp, km for atp; bold red lines below the scale,
green logos), binding to the open form (bold blue arrow;
shaded blue logos) and binding accompanied by inducedfit (itc for aqp; small angle x-ray scattering for atp11;
bold green lines above the scale, blue to green logos) are
compared. the differential between aqp and atp
affinities is comparable in the two cases where all
quantities have been determined. the same is true for
the estimate of the free energy of the conformational
change, given by the difference between the induced-fit
and exchange dissociation constants.

comparison of the three aqp binding processes
reflected in ki* and the itc titrations is complicated
by the fact that binding can induce conformational
changes with non-negligible intrinsic free energies.11,28 there are three, distinct binding scenarios,
indicated by the schematic logos in figure 2(b).
these include: (i) binding to the open conformation
(blue) and (ii) rebinding into the assembled active
site vacated by a ligand (exchange; green), neither of
which involve conformational changes, and (iii)
binding of a second ligand to the singly liganded
dimer (induced-fit; blue=>green), which confounds
the conformation change with the nucleotide-binding affinity. in light of these three scenarios, the aqp
binding affinities in figure 2(a) are consistent with
other, related thermodynamic measurements,
including the aqp inhibition constant and the af-

the thermodynamic data from figure 2 are sufficient to allow an experimental determination of the
free energy change for the conformational equilibrium between open and closed, prets states in the
presence and absence of ligands, using the thermodynamic cycle in figure 3. the latter value is equivalent to the allosteric constant.24 the cycle in figure 3
resolves the free energies associated with the inducedfit active-site assembly into purely conformational
and purely ligand binding equilibria, which implicitly
include any proton transfers associated with binding
(we have not measured the ph dependence of either
atp or aqp affinity). we assume in addition from the
crystallographic symmetry of the closed, prets state
that dissociation constants for both nucleotide-binding events to that form are identical.
successive dissociations from the fully liganded
open state are distinct; experimental determination of
the first is convolved with the free energy change
associated with the induced-fit assembly in the
doubly liganded form. the determinations of comparable equilibrium constants for both atp and aqp,
however, allow us to de-convolve the ligand binding
and conformational free energies of this process by
regression analysis (table 2), which is motivated by
the near exact differences between the two ligands in
the induced-fit and exchange binding scenarios.

respectively, as is the free energy for the induced-fit
conformational change associated with binding the
second nucleotide ligand to the open conformation.

in table 2, lig is either 0 or 1 depending on whether
the ligand is atp or aqp, and if is 0 or 1 depending
on whether or not the process involves a conformational change. the three adjustable parameters are
<deltagq,t>, the average free energy for binding either
t or q to either state, deltagqvst, the incremental free
energy for binding q, relative to t, and deltaginduced-fit,
the conformational free energy for reversing the

defined previously.11 the slight non-isomorphism of
the 1.3% increase along the c axis is consistent with
conformational changes described below with
respect to prets state atp complexes. the polypeptide chain runs from the n-terminal (met1) to the cterminal (arg328) through the electron density map

asymmetric unit contains a single monomer, crystal
packing imposes symmetry on the functionally
asymmetric dimer. nevertheless, for low-energy

and 259–266 in the sd to bind the anticodon) that

(figure 5).

·

 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  conformation
the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  monomer consists of two domains, a
rossmann dinucleotide binding fold of ∼ 200 residues (rf), which starts with the n-terminal beta
strand a, and a smaller domain of ∼90 residues that
includes a four-helix bundle, the c-terminal helix of
which extends back by ∼ 35 residues with a
pronounced kink, past the rf, where it interacts
across the dimer interface. binding sites for tryptophan and atp are created opposite each crossover
connection in the rf. the highly twisted beta-sheet
brings three peptide signatures, tign from helix
alphaa, gxdq from helix alphae, and kmsks together to
bind the nucleotide, helix alphad providing specificitydetermining elements for amino acid binding whose
configurations remain essentially unchanged in the
course of catalysis.
from comparisons between several  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  structures,11–13,15 it appeared that the functional  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
domain boundary actually falls between the tign
and kmsks signatures, on one hand, and the gxdq
signature with the main body of rf, on the other
hand. coordinated movements between the two
domains can be resolved into two internal coordinates, reflecting the hinge opening between domains

and their relative twist.28 the hinge motion is
effected via rotation of the axis of helix alphaa, relative
to the rest of the rf. its motion is tightly coupled to
that of the four-helix bundle via the hydrophobic
side-chains of i16 and m193, from tign and
kmsks, respectively, together with i20, which join
a substantial hydrophobic core within the four-helix
bundle containing the anticodon-binding site to
form what we have called the small domain (sd).
the rigid-body motions of the sd provide an
important link between active-site chemistry and
the orientation of the anticodon-binding site. the
twist involves internal rotations within the interface
between helix alphaa and the sd, for which the largest
displacement resides in the kmsks loop.
the overall conformation of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  in complex
with aqp is quite similar to that from the pretransition state complex with atp, obtained under
identical crystallizing conditions.11 formation of
this conformation implies that aqp provides binding energy comparable to that for atp, apparently
necessary and sufficient to trigger both the 7.5°
hinge-closing and 9° twisting rotations of the sd28
relative to the rf, closing the active site around the
nucleotide to form the closed, prets state and
restraining access to the tryptophan-binding pocket.
structural differences between the aqp complex
and those reported previously for the prets
conformations,  xxxd83xxx  and  xxxd83xxx , are subtle (figure
6). naïve superposition of the aqp complex and the
prets complexes yields rmsd values of 0.707 å
( xxxd83xxx ) and 0.746 å ( xxxd83xxx ), while the two prets
complexes agree with an rmsd of 0.384 å. the two
previously described prets structures afford the
opportunity to test the significance of these differences. for this purpose, the rossmann folds of all
structures were superimposed as described at the
end of experimental procedures, and then the r.m.s.
coordinate differences were determined between the
calpha atoms of all aligned structures and separately for
the domains.

figure 5. electron-density maps in the region of the nucleotide pocket superimposed with the arpwarp first model
for the two first views and with the refined final model (pdb id 2ov4). these maps were calculated (a) with experimental
siras phases output by sharp, (b) after density modification by solomon (black contour aims at highlighting the
nucleotide) and (c) final sigmaa 2fo–fc map within buster. contouring level was 1.2sigma except for the solomon map
(2sigma).

the main contribution to the rmsds between
prets and aqp complexes comes from a reorientation of the sd, which untwists toward the
products conformation (figure 6(a)). this shift,
albeit small (the r.m.s. coordinate difference over
the rf excluding the loop 111–119 is less than 0.3
and that over the sd is more than 0.7), places the sd
in between positions assumed in the prets states
and in the adenylate products complex (figure 6(b)).
multiple regression models indicate that both
replacing atp by aqp and the sd orientation
(twist angle) are significant contributors of the
rmsd values, with t-test probabilities of 2 × 10− 4,
and 3 × 10− 3, respectively.
untwisting of the sd in the products conformation displaces the kmsks sequence and the leaving
ppi group by 1.42 å from its position in the atp
complex.11 the twist angles of the prets, aqp, and

products complexes are 8.9°, 8.1°, and 4.6°. the aqp
structure therefore places the kmsks loop approximately 20% (0.19) of the way toward the products
conformation, consistent with a similar estimate
based on rmsds (0.16). we return to the possible
dynamic participation of domain orientation in the
catalytic process in the discussion.
a last, conspicuous difference between the two
binary, closed complexes lies in the path of the loop
(112–119) that forms a gate over the active site and
probably helps anchor the trna's 3′ terminus for
aminoacylation. the terminal residues (112–113) of
the alpha-helix (106–113) in the prets state unwind,
creating a significantly modified path for the main
chain in this region. the effect is to move this loop in
the opposite direction from the kmsks loop across
the active site, thereby slightly opening the crevice
to the active site.

absence of magnesium and effective binding affinity
of aqp
the electron density for the nucleotide-binding
site is shown in figure 5 and modelling of an aqp
molecule into fourier difference maps is unambiguous. palpha and pgamma show up in the density at the level
of sulphur atoms whereas pbeta and pdelta are at a level
equivalent to the most stable backbone carbon
atoms. curiously, no density appears for a counter
cation in the aqp complex. polyphosphates have
high affinity for  xxxd2531xxx  in solution, and
mg 2+ was present in excess in crystallization.
however, the position of the beta-phosphate replaces
much of the volume occupied by magnesium in the
atp complexes, and no density appears elsewhere
near the phosphate groups. as noted above, there
appears to be a competition between mg2+:aqp and
aqp: xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  interactions, such that aqp binds to
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  at least as tightly as it does to mg2+.
aqp configuration and environment
the adenosine moiety superimposes remarkably
precisely on the position taken in the atp complex
(figure 7), making in most cases essentially the same
interactions with the protein. carbonyl oxygen
atoms from ile183 and met193 recognize the n6
amino group, and the purine ring is centered on the
carbonyl-carbon of the conserved gly21 as in all
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  adenine nucleotide complexes.11,15
if the rf domains are aligned (figure 6(b)), the
adenosine, ribose, and terminal pyrophosphate
moieties of atp and aqp superimpose closely
(figure 7(a)). the ribose position has also changed
little from its position in the closed atp complex,
and therefore differs from its unique position
observed in the atp-indolmycin complex.30 however, gly144 from the 144gxdq147 sequence which
faces the ribose, has shifted toward the o2′ hydroxyl
allowing the nitrogen group to make an h-bond
with od2 of asp146 (table 3).
three water molecules found in all  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  crystal
structures that contain the adenosine moiety (five
prets complexes and six products complexes) are
also preserved in the immediate neighborhood of
the nucleotide in the aqp complex (figure 6(b)).
one (w557) stacks over the purine ring bridging the
 xxxd146xxx  carboxylate to the c-terminal beta-strand of the
rossmann fold (residue 181). another (w541) lies
between the ribose 3′-oh group and the s6 hydroxyl group and the g7 carbonyl oxygen. s6 is structurally homologous to c35 in b. stearothermophilus
 xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx , which plays a significant role in transition
stabilization, probably via a homologous bound
water molecule.31 the third, w513, links the t15
hydroxyl group of the tign signature to the nonbridging o2beta,gamma of the nucleotide. this water molecule may protonate the transition state configuration
of that oxygen, assuming a role played by histidine
in the canonical high signature. three additional
water molecules (gray) observed in the atp complexes are missing from the aqp complex.

more unexpected was the accommodation of a
longer phosphate tail by the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  active site.
thermodynamic linkage between binding free
energies and conformations implies that different
enzyme conformations selectively bind different
ligands. by this reasoning, the alpha, beta, and gamma phosphates of aqp might be expected to superimpose on
the atp triphosphate, with its terminal phosphate
extending beyond the exit gate of the active site,
delimited by side-chains of ser196 and lys111.
however, rather than extending fully, the aqp
terminal pyrophosphate moiety occupies very
nearly the same position as the pyrophosphate
leaving group in the atp complexes, “scrunching”
the beta-phosphate in between it and the amp moiety.
major differences between the two adenine
nucleotide ligands are thus confined to the configuration of the palpha phosphate and mg2+ in the atp
complexes and the palpha and pbeta phosphate groups of
aqp. fitting the pgamma and pdelta phosphates into the
pocket formed by the kmsks loop compels the
polyphosphate to turn sharply at the beta-phosphate,
which therefore overlaps the volume occupied by
the mg2+ in prets complex structures. the extra
phosphate relocates the alpha-phosphate by ∼ 0.4 å
toward the tryptophan carboxylate nucleophile
while pressing the ppi mimic deeper into the
kmsks loop. as a consequence, the bridging
oxygen atom between pbeta and pgamma (o3beta) assumes a
position 2.73 å from palpha, compared to the corresponding distance in atp (1.62 å; figure 7(a)). this
arrangement is quite close to that expected for a
dissociative transition state.
the presence of the additional beta-phosphate group
imposes two unusual interactions on nearby electronegative groups: odelta1_146-o2beta and o1beta–o1delta (figure
7(c) and bottom two rows in table 3). the distances
of these contacts, 2.41 å, implies that they must
share protons to minimize electrostatic repulsion.
both interactions therefore entail an increase of
several ph units in the pkas of the respective
constituent acidic groups. their contributions to
binding affinity therefore are likely to be
unfavorable.32 the pbeta oxygen atoms also form
weak hydrogen bonds to nepsilon2-gln147 and nepsilon2-gln9.
the former interaction is absent entirely, while the
latter is directed toward the alpha-phosphate (3.08 å)
and mg2+ (3.8 å) in the prets atp complexes. thus,
the beta-phosphate seems to exploit an environment
similar to that of the mg2+ whose volume it replaces.
comparison of binding interactions in the atp and
aqp complexes
the subtle repositioning of the ppi mimic significantly improves its interactions with the kmsks
and loop (figure 7(c)). notably, a hydrogen bond
between s194 and k192 in the atp complexes is
broken in the aqp complex, and both residues make
hydrogen bonds to phosphate oxygen atoms, one of
which (s194-o3delta) is new. the novelty of the s194
interaction motivated us to inventory all contacts
between  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  and both adenine nucleotides.

the resulting inventory, with standard deviations
based on the two prets crystal structures,  xxxd83xxx  and
 xxxd83xxx , is compiled according to binding group
subsite in table 3. all subsites show shortened
contacts with the aqp ligand, relative to atp. these
changes amount to seven standard deviations in the
pyrophosphate-binding subsite, to five standard
deviations in the ribose-binding subsite, and to
nine standard deviations in the adenine-binding
subsite. the only contact that does not shorten is

that between the 3′oh group and w541. the
differential contacts include both van der waals
and hydrogen-bonding interactions. they are uniform and widely distributed throughout the entire
volume occupied by adenine nucleotide. notably,
the least dramatic changes, both in quantity and
in significance occur in the environment of the
alpha-phosphate, which shorten by less than one
standard deviation. thus, the strengthened interactions to the adenosine and ppi moieties, together

discussion
the mechanisms by which class ic aars catalyze
amino acid activation have been the object of
considerable investigation. mutational studies of

2.41
2.41

 xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  combined with pre-steady-state kinetics8,33
demonstrated catalytic roles for numerous residues
remote from the site of chemical changes in the
transition state for tyrosine activation. although
lacking in many structural details, these studies
sketched convincingly the outlines of a novel source
of catalytic rate enhancement. participation of these
residues is both significant and transient; they affect
only the nucleotide; and, in the case of the ppibinding subsite, they are limited to a role in

118
transition-state binding. despite these data, the
overall mechanism remains sketchy. while they
are crucial, mutational and kinetic data can be
interpreted in different ways, because they lack
important structural details. thus, they are hard to
match with models of the transition state configuration of atp itself during the catalyzed in-line
displacement of ppi by the alpha-carboxylate. the
structure of the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :aqp complex brings complementary new structural data to bear on how the
remote residues implicated by fersht's studies
might contribute to the mechanism.
we suggest in this discussion how data
reported here bear on six questions relevant to
the catalytic mechanisms of amino acid activation
by aars: (1) why is aqp unable to function as a
substrate? (2) what is the catalytic role of the
single mg2+ in the rate acceleration observed for
class i aars? (3) how does the metal interact with
other potential sources for electrostatic catalysis?
(4) are aqp:protein interactions similar to any of
those responsible for accelerating amino acid
activation? (5) does domain motion (untwisting)
play a catalytic role, and if so, how? (6) do class i
and class ii aars share a common transition state
stabilization mechanism?
why is aqp not a substrate?
chemically, triphosphate should be approximately as good a leaving group as pyrophosphate. if the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  active site stabilized only the
altered, transition state configuration of the alphaphosphate group, one might expect to see a lag
corresponding to the depletion of aqp, followed
by rapid formation of [32p]atp. this does not
occur, implying that the interaction of aqp with
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  precludes its acting as a substrate. we
suggest two, mutually complementary, reasons
for this. first, excluding the divalent metal from
the active site precludes a catalytic role with
aqp. second, the superimposed structures in
figure 7(a) suggest that the scrunched tetraphosphate, having already positioned the adenosine
and ppi moieties to approximate the transition
state configurations recognized by  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , has
insufficient room in the active site to expand and
break the palpha-pbeta linkage.

 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :aqp: distributed transition state binding

how does mg2+ accelerate phosphoryl transfer?
detailed empirical valence bond (evb) simulations of two nuclease mechanisms34 indicated that
the electrostatic interactions with mg2+ contribute
> 10 orders of magnitude in rate enhancement in the
phosphodiester hydrolysis catalyzed by enzymes
using both one35 and two36 mg2+ ions. in light of that
estimate, it is somewhat startling that mg2+ accelerates uncatalyzed phosphoryl-transfer reactions by
a factor of only 2 or 3.1,31,43
numerous reports suggest that mg2+ plays similar
roles in the mechanisms of aars. previous estimates
for  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  catalysis11 suggested that mg2+ accelerates
the catalyzed reaction by a factor of at least 100.
however, it is surprisingly difficult to exclude mg2+
from assays. we therefore have repeated the experiments described by retailleau et al., using buffers
and atp scrubbed with chelex 10037 and then
supplemented with increasing concentrations to
5 mm edta. equilibrium calculations indicate that
under these conditions, the free [mg2+] should be less
than 0.01 nm, while the km for mg2+ is around
2 mum.11 at the highest edta levels,  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  activity
plateaus at rates about four orders of magnitude
slower than that with mg2+. the divalent metal
therefore appears to contribute a major fraction of
the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  transition stabilization free energy.
the contrast between the strong dependence of
aars catalysis on mg2+ and its minimal impact on the
uncatalyzed rate implies that the protein itself must
link the mg2+ mechanistically to the transition state.
the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  active-site mg2+ configuration compounds
the question: no active-site residues interact directly
with the mg2+ in any of the ground-state structures,
although simulations suggest that q9 may play a role
in the transition state mg2+ configuration (h. hu,
personal communication).
we recently identified a “minimal catalytic
domain” (mcd) in the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  rossmann dinucleotide-binding fold, which we have excised and
engineered for stability.2 this 130-residue fragment
includes all but one of the residues (k111) that
interact with the two substrates. it catalyzes tryptophan activation roughly five orders of magnitude
more slowly than the intact protein. transition state
stabilization of 109-fold by the mcd is comparable to
that from the metal in nuclease reactions.34 a

figure 7. differences between the closed, pre-transition state atp complex and the complex formed with aqp. (a) the
two ligands are supeimposed and precisely aligned, once the rf domains are aligned. the adenosine, ribose and terminal
pyrophosphate moieties of atp (functional color) and aqp (wheat) compounds superimpose closely; the differences
being largely in the configuration of the palpha phosphate and mg2+ in the atp complexes and the palpha and pbeta phosphate
groups of aqp. a consequence of the sequestration of the pgamma and pdelta phosphates into the pocket formed by the kmsks
loop is that the bridging oxygen atom between pbeta and pgamma (o3beta) is 2.73 å from palpha, compared to the corresponding
distance in atp (1.62 å). (b) three water molecules (blue) conserved in all  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  crystal structures that contain the
adenosine moiety (five prets complexes and six products complexes) are also preserved in the aqp complex. three
additional water molecules (gray) observed in the atp complexes are missing from the aqp complex. (c) detailed
changes are conspicuous in the interactions between the kmsks loop and the ppi mimic. notably, a hydrogen bond
between s194 and k192 in the atp complexes is broken in the aqp complex, and both residues make strong hydrogen
bonds to phosphate oxygen atoms. dashed lines denote close contacts between negatively charged oxygen atoms,
expected to increase pka values for associated protons.

reasonable inference is that the rudi-mentary mcd
active-site, while providing no direct linkage to mg2+,
nonetheless provides an environment in which
electrostatic catalysis can function at a significant
level. the functional linkage between the protein
and mg2+, therefore, depends strongly on as yet
unspecified interactions within the active site.
how does mg2+ interact with other potential
sources of electrostatic catalysis present in
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx ?

personal communication). the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  active site in
the aqp complex nevertheless reflects each of the
following properties:
(i) the nucleophile is little changed between
ground state and transition state. warshel34
argues from simulations that the hydroxy
nucleophile in hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester bonds must be stabilized, and implicates
the metal in this role in both single and twometal mechanisms. the tryptophan carboxylate
nucleophile is four orders of magnitude more
acidic than water, and therefore requires correspondingly less electrostatic stabilization. the
hydrogen-bonding arrangement involving
y125, water w613, the mg2+, and the tryptophan
alphanh2 group all appear to influence the electronic configuration of one carboxylate oxygen
atom (arbitrarily o2) in such a way that the other
oxygen atom can serve more effectively as the
nucleophile (figure 8(a)). the nh2 group may
ensure that the tyrosine hydroxyl group serves
as a hydrogen bond donor to the o2 atom, while
the polarity of w613 imposed by its proximity to
the catalytic mg2+ ensures that the o2 atom
remains conjugated, freeing the o1 pi electrons
for nucleophilic attack. the mg2+ may, therefore,
indirectly sustain the requisite properties of the
inline carboxylate oxygen, in keeping with fothergill et al.34.
notably, however, the tryptophan subsite undergoes little, if any rearrangement throughout
the known catalytic cycle, from which we infer
that there is little modulation of the nucleophile,
consistent with (i).
(ii) the non-bridging oxygen atoms of the chemically changing phosphoryl group (palpha in this
case) show a modest decrease in electron density. although the o1alpha atom interacts with the
mg2+, the non-bridging oxygen atoms of the alphaphosphate in figure 8(b) do not interact with
any active-site cationic residues that might
further stabilize increased negative charge. the
sole polar interaction from the protein that appears poised to assume such a role is the backbone amide nitrogen of q9. this group would
form a better hydrogen bond to the non-bridging alpha-phosphate oxygen, o2alpha, as the three phosphate oxygen atoms become planar in either a
metaphosphate or pentavalent phosphate transition state. indeed, this interaction is reminiscent of the use of backbone amide groups to
form the “oxyanion hole” in serine proteases.39
the electostatic neutrality of this group, however, is consistent with (ii).
(iii) the bridging oxygen atom of the leaving group
develops the greatest increase in negative
charge. in contrast to the relative lack of attention to the alpha-phosphate, the similar positions
of the beta-phosphate of aqp and the mg2+ position in the prets state suggest that the mg2+ is
potentially suited to compensate increased neg-

121
ative charge on the oxygen bridging the alpha and betaphosphates of atp. interactions with the bridging oxygen atom in the scissile bond also
include a contact (2.9 å) with ndelta2 of n18 in the
tign signature and one (3.0 å) with nzeta of k195
in the kmsks signature. the special focus on
this bridging oxygen atom is in keeping with the
expectation that it develops the greatest increase
in negative charge in the transition state (iii).
(iv) modest increases in negative charge develop on
the non-bridging oxygen atoms of the leaving
group. groups arrayed about the gamma and deltaphosphates of aqp (k111, k192, k195, s194,
s196; figure 8(b)), and in particular the novelty
of the interaction of s194 with the gamma-phosphate,
provide considerable evidence that were the ppi
leaving group of atp to move into the same
position as the gamma-delta phosphate groups of aqp,
the ppi binding subsite would stabilize increased negative charge on the leaving group.
t15 from the tign signature also interacts via a
conserved, bound water molecule with the nonbridging oxygen o2beta (2.9 å). this notable
interaction could donate a proton to the newly
formed ppi. these multiple electropositive interactions are all consistent with (iv).
(v) items (ii), (iii), and (iv) together imply that the
change in electrostatic potential between
ground state and transition state is dipolar.
for amino acid activation, the alpha-phosphate
becomes relatively more positive, the ppi
leaving group more negative, relative to the
ground state. the graphic representation of the
electrostatic field in the active site (figures 8
and 9) reveals that the immediate environment
of the scissile bond is indeed complementary to

 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  active site. blue and red colors represent positive
and negative charge, respectively, on a range from −30 to
30 electron volts/å2. the ligand is aqp, and the gamma and deltaphosphate groups are nestled into the leaving group
subsite, which is entirely surrounded by positive charge

the pocket and are surrounded by negative charge density

a dipolar transition state. the minus charges on
 xxxd146xxx  and the tryptophan carboxylate provide a
negative field proximal to the alpha-phosphate and
on the face of the metaphosphate facing the
nucleophile, while the plus charges of basic
residues just enumerated provide a positive
field around the leaving group, consistent with
(v).
do  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :aqp interactions resemble any that
accelerate amino acid activation?
the 105-fold activity deficit in the mcd implies
additional interactions between the active site and
the other parts of the protein, which alter either the
structure of the mcd active site, or how it functions,
or both. if, as we suggested above, the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  mcd
provides a rudimentary environment facilitating
electrostatic catalysis by mg2+, the remainder of
the protein must enhance that rate by five orders of
magnitude by some sort of fine-tuning, which may
complement and “supercharge” the catalytic effect
of the mg 2+ . the aqp thermodynamics and
structure shed new light on the possible nature of
this amplified catalytic contribution in the intact
protein.
the affinity of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  for aqp falls short of values
observed for close transition state mimics of other
reactions.25 moreover, the geometry and charge distribution of the configurations immediately surrounding the scissile bond are radically different in
aqp and in the putative transition state derived for
mg2+ atp. the alpha-phosphate has a ground state
configuration, while the bound form significantly
distorts the charge distribution expected from the
transition state mg2+ atp configuration. yet, aqp
binding is 200-fold tighter than atp and results
directly in crystals nearly isomorphous to those of the
pre-transition state complexes reported previously.11
the energetics of the dramatic differences between
the aqp beta-phosphate and the mg2+ cannot be
evaluated on the basis of data reported here. it is
likely, however, that since the beta-phosphate cannot
mimic anything like a transition state configuration,
its interactions with  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  contribute unfavorably to
the aqp binding affinity. if the 200-fold greater
affinity of aqp does, as we believe, represent binding
interactions similar to those in the transition state,
these must lie elsewhere in the complex. to what
extent, then, might aqp resemble the transition state?
the additional beta-phosphate group in aqp has a
distinctive structural consequence: it pushes the
terminal ppi mimic and the alpha-phosphate away from
each other by approximately the amount expected for
a transition state with dissociative character (figure
7(a)). mimicking that separation drives the adenosine
and ppi moieties deeper into binding pockets on
opposite sides of the domain boundary, the adenosine
toward the rossmann fold and the ppi toward the
kmsks loop and c-terminal anticodon-binding
domain, where each benefits from enhanced binding
interactions. the gamma and delta-phosphate groups of the ppi
mimic intensify all of the interactions seen between

·

the kmsks loop and the beta and gamma-phosphates of the
ppi leaving group of atp, and a new interaction
develops from s194 of the kmsks loop. these and
corresponding interactions to the adenosine are
strengthened (table 3). the 200-fold greater affinity
of aqp, relative to mg2+ atp, suggests that these
distributed interactions must be strong enough to
compensate for the unfavorable electrostatic substitutions near the alpha-phosphate plus ∼−3.2 kcal/mol of
additional binding free energy. complementarity of
the active site to the actual transition state may
therefore be extensively delocalized into the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
adenosine and ppi-binding subsites, as suggested by
the  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  mutational and kinetic studies.

·

aqp appears to meet in a novel way the usual
criteria for a transition state mimic
aqp is not a substrate. it binds to  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  with
substantially higher affinity than does atp. it
interacts with the active site in a manner suggesting
the distributed origins of enhanced transition state
affinity.  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  responds to the altered configurations of adenosine and the ppi mimic by enhancing
previously identified interactions to atp and by
forming novel binding interactions. table 3 documents that the active site closes more or less
uniformly on the inhibitor. the broad distribution
of interactions responsible for the higher affinity of
aqp throughout the adenine nucleotide-binding
subsites is fully consistent with the extensive mutational data for the homologous  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  system,8
which implicated comparable interactions in transition state binding. both the high binding affinity of
aqp and the crystal structure therefore verify in
unexpected detail many expectations for a transition
state in which transient, strong binding to the adenosine and ppi moieties are important for transition
state stabilization.
in summary, introduction of the beta-phosphate between palpha and the ppi leaving group lengthens the
distance between the leaving group and palpha, moving
the former into the kmsks loop and the latter toward the nucleophile. the resulting configuration
strengthens a variety of distributed binding interactions that, we suggest, contribute to transition state
stabilization.
what is the role of domain motion?
the free energy cost of induced-fit, + 3.0 kcal/mol,
measured for the first time here, is quite substantial.
how might this stored free energy be utilized during
catalysis?
a partial, qualitative, solution to this puzzle
emerged from md simulations, which revealed a
significant interaction between the ppi oxygen
distances to mg2+ and to the epsilon-nh2 groups of k111
and k192,28 implicating that interaction directly in
the endergonic twist angle between domains in the
prets state. the exergonic untwisting domain motion observed in the products conformation,40,41 and
the strengthening of interactions to ppi in the aqp

123

 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx :aqp: distributed transition state binding

complex demonstrated here imply that breaking the
bond between the bridging oxygen atom and the alphaphosphorus would allow the ppi leaving group to
form stronger bonds to the kmsks loop as it rotates
away from the alpha-phosphate, likely accompanied by
the mg2+ , which is not present in the product
complex with trp-5′amp.13,15
moreover, the domain re-orientation associated
with aqp binding, which rotates the kmsks loop
toward the products conformation, is exergonic.28
two reinforcing effects therefore contribute to
higher aqp affinity; the separated adenosine and
ppi fit better into their respective binding subsites,
and the enabling domain re-orientation is energetically favorable.
loss of the twist takes the ribose and ppi-binding
subsites in opposite directions, suggesting an
element of strain in the catalytic mechanism. the
structural re-organization of the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  active site, in
the conversion of the prets to the products
conformation via the intermediate aqp-bound
state suggests that relocation of the leaving group
could occur prior to the approach of the nucleophile,
as in a fully dissociative transition state. the
problem with this notion is the well-known presumption that protein conformations are stabilized
by non-bonded interactions far too weak to distort
chemical bonds.42 essentially, this argument is that
van der waals forces change rapidly with distance,
so strain can be relaxed by small atomic movements.
the development of incremental binding energy in
the aqp complex suggests a novel formulation of the
strain that is not vitiated by the argument of levitt
and warshel. coordinated increases in binding to the
dissociating pyrophosphate leaving group, coupled
to its mechanical relocation can effectively strain the
palpha-pbeta linkage statistically, by selecting those bondlength fluctuations that lead to bond breaking
without actually changing equilibrium bond distances. by coupling the unfavorable free energy
changes associated with the induced-fit to the
stronger binding interactions to the dissociated
leaving group, the domain relocation therefore
could have a significant catalytic effect.
do class i and class ii aars use different
mechanisms?
the distinction between the class-defining consensus motifs, high and kmsks for class i,43–45
and motifs 2 and 3 for class ii,46 probably reflects
differences in the detailed mechanism by which they
catalyze phosphoryl transfer. class ii aars appear
poised to stabilize developing negative charges on
the non-bridging oxygen atoms in a pentavalent alphaphosphate group using a conserved arginine residue
from motif 2. moreover, class ii active sites do not
provide an extensive, mobile binding site for the ppi
leaving group, whose negative charges appear to be
neutralized primarily by multiple mg2+ ions coordinated by active-site  xxxd2431xxx  residues.47–49 this
arrangement is reminiscent of that in the “two-mg2+
mechanism” suggested for the analogous synthetic

reaction carried out by nucleic acid polymerases36
and the associated exonucleolytic reaction.50
in most class i active sites, on the other hand, the
kmsks loop has been implicated by mutational7,8,51
and structural52,53 studies as a (dynamic) binding
site for the pyrophosphate leaving group. further,
the kmsks loop weakens atp binding in the pretransition state ground state, while strengthening
transition-state binding. 28,51,54 thus, conserved
lysine residues and a single mg2+ in class i active
sites play slightly different roles to those played by
conserved arginine residues and multiple mg2+ ions
in class ii enzymes. mg2+ therefore must function
somewhat differently in class i and class ii aars.
an important consequence is that there is likely a
requirement for the single mg2+ in class i mechanisms to be more mobile than the multiple metals in
class ii acive sites, consistent with the absence of
protein ligands and the previously observed weakening of mg2+–phosphate oxygen interactions by
lysine epsilon-amino groups observed in  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx .28
there are two exceptions to the class i pattern in
which the second lysine is missing from the kmsks
signature. arginyl-trna synthetases provide a second lysine from upstream of the high signature.16
eukaryotic cytoplasmic trprss provide instead an
arginine from a similar position homologous to
q9.55 in these enzymes, this upstream arginine
residue might help stabilize a pentavalent phosphoryl moiety, rather than the metaphosphate that
appears more appropriate in b. stearothermophilus
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx .
concluding remarks
the path actually taken by a particular enzymatic
or non-enzymatic system through the two-dimensional surface of bond-breaking and bond-making is
difficult to determine, but can be studied experimentally by kinetic isotope effects,56,57 and theoretically by quantum-mechanical simulations.58,59 in
particular, the low-energy path may depend critically on the balance between the electrostatic charges developed on the participants and the ability of
the environment (solution or enzymatic) to complement it.6 release of pyrophosphate in biosynthetic
reactions can generate altered negative charges on a
relatively large number of phosphate oxygen atoms,
making such determination especially difficult. for
this reason, any conclusion regarding the precise
nature of the transition state for tryptophan activation by  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  must remain speculative without
further experimental and computational work. the
data reported here underscore the importance of
doing such studies.
the affinity of a transition state analog should
respond in the same way as the enzymatic rate to any
perturbation that changes the rate,23 leading to a
linear free energy relation. an orthogonal experimental test of the extent to which aqp mimics the
transition state would thus be to measure aqp
affinity for a range of variant trprss with different
activities. the activity of the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  mcd is reduced

124
by ∼five orders of magnitude.2 this fragment should
not be inhibited by aqp, because the free aqp
concentration cannot be increased by that relative
amount. within the range between native  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  and
its minimal catalytic domain lie a number of engineered fragments and point mutants with different
specific activities. it should therefore be possible to
compare the aqp affinity and activity of such
variants, along lines suggested by wolfenden.23

experimental procedures
determination of ki for aqp
pyrophosphate exchange assays were performed as
described.11 assays at aqp concentrations of 4 × 10− 4 m,
and 8 × 10− 3 m were analyzed to determine the inhibition
constant.
synthesis, purification, and isothermal titration
calorimetric analysis of (aqp)
when this work started, aqp was commercially
available from sigma biochemical (a 4636), and that
material was used for all crystallographic experiments and
the determination of the inhibition constant, ki. once it
became clear that aqp represented a potential transition
state analog inhibitor, we were unable to purchase more
compound. subsequent titration experiments were therefore carried out using material that we synthesized as
follows. the ribonucleotide, 2′,3′isopropylidineadenosine
(sigma i 4002; aldrich 1-2,240-4) was rendered anhydrous by five repeated evaporations of anhydrous
dimethylformamide (dmf; aldrich 22,705-6) and was
subsequently maintained under dried (p2o5) nitrogen.
the anhydrous nucleotide (0.641 g, 2 mmol) was dissolved
in 5 ml of anhydrous dmf and treated with 1.135 g
(7 mmol) of 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (aldrich 11,553-3) in
10 ml of anhydrous dmf and maintained under dried
nitrogen for 12 h, followed by treatment with 21 ml of
methanol. after 30 min, the solution was treated with
13.07 g (10 mmol) of tetrabutylammonium tetraphosphate
(prepared from ca2-tetraphosphate, city chemicals
59415-82-6 by ion exchange chromatography) in 20 ml of
anhydrous dmf and maintained under anhydrous conditions for 24 h.
the crude 2′,3′ isopropyllidineadenosinetetraphosphate
was filtered, evaporated to dryness, and deblocked using
10% (v/v) triflouroacetic acid/water for 12 h. the
tetraphosphate was purified from less highly charged
components using ion-exclusion chromatography on
dowex 50w-x4-400. 60 subsequent purification was
achieved by adsorption to acid-washed charcoal and
elution at 55 °c with pyridine. the resulting compound
was characterized, relative to a commercial sample of aqp,
atp, and adp by thin-layer chromatography on deaecellulose plates using 1.0 m phosphate (ph 3.4), and on
silica gel plates in ethanol:nh3:water, 90:1:9 (by vol.).
aqp concentration was determined using epsilon254 = 15,400/
mol/cm.
isothermal titration calorimetry with aqp was performed using a microcal vp-itc calorimeter at two different concentrations of ligand (2.4 × 10− 4 m, 8.5 × 10− 5 m)
and protein (6 × 10− 6 m, 6 × 10− 5 m) and corrected for dilution of macromolecule and ligand by separate titrations.

recombinant native and selenomethionylated  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
of b. stearothermophilus were overexpressed in e. coli
and purified as described.12 binary native complex
crystals were grown by microdialysis (5 mul of 4 mg/ml
protein versus 2000 ml well). the protein stock buffer
(0.6 m potassium phosphate solution in the presence of
50% (v/v) glycerol) was then extensively exchanged by a
precipitant solution containing only ∼ 1 m sodium citrate
(ph 7.5 0, 10 mm mgcl2 and 10 mm (freshly in solution) tri
(cyclohexylammonium) adenosine 5′ tetraphosphate
(aqp) (commercial source sigma). one mono crystal
appeared within two weeks and then grew rapidly to
suitable dimension 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm for x-ray
diffraction experiment. prior to the flash-cooling performed directly in the stream of liquid nitrogen at 100 k,
the crystal was quickly dipped into a 15% (v/v) glycerol
cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 m cæsium chloride.
refined value for crystal mosaicity during data reduction
was equal to 0.56°.
data were recorded on a raxis-rigaku iv setup, at
the copper kalpha wavelength, using a 18 cm mar image plate,
in a single sweep of 70 images with 1° of oscillation.
diffraction data were processed using the hkl package61
(see table 1 for statistics). dataset was 95% complete to
2.5 å but the reflections in the last resolution shell present
an average i/sigma of 2.0 (between 2.59 and 2. 5 å) and a
rsym < 0.5.
native and derivative structure-factor amplitudes were
calculated using truncate62,63 and then derivative
amplitudes were scaled relative to the natives between 10
and 4.0 å using the program scaleit.64,63 later, more
redundant and higher resolution data were collected
from a selenomethionylated crystal complexed with an
mg ++ atp using the same x-ray diffraction setup (see
table 4). this potential derivative crystal turned out to be
more isomorphous with the native aqp complex than
former atp complex crystals (riso = 0.163 versus 0.428 see
table 4) and therefore was useful for ir phasing.
molecular replacement using the amore software65
was then used to place a model (protein atoms from  xxxd83xxx )
in the asymmetric unit. the best solution obtained after
search of rotation function then translation function using
x-ray data from 8 to 4 å resolution had a structure factor
correlation coefficient of 69.0 and an r-factor of 33.3%. the
output coordinates were divided into five pieces (rf- alphahelix a (residues 1–15 and 30–165), alpha-helix a, (residues

265), helical long path (residues 266–328) and subjected to
a rigid-body fitting using the appropriate macro in cns66:
r-factor decreased from 49% to 44% after significant reorientation of the sd with respect to the rf. phases
derived from the fitting coordinates were then used to
calculate isomorphous and anomalous difference fourier
maps to locate positions of heavy atoms.
phasing was provided by isomorphous differences for
nine of ten se-s atoms, plus one cæsium cation whose
atomic coordinates were input into sharp67 to start heavyatom parameter refinement for sir phasing. the weak
anomalous signal was also treated by refining scattering
factors for se-s and cs at the cukalpha wavelength. sir(as)
phases were derived to 2.5 å with overall figures of merit
> 0.3 (see table 5). phase quality was sufficient to draw an
accurate molecular envelope that permitted solvent-density
modification (solomon),68 as implemented within
sharp, to output a detailed electron density map using
an optimized starting solvent fraction of 48.7%. the quality
of this 2.5 å map was assessed by the autotracing of about
90% of the protein backbone model in 120 cycles by the
warpntrace protocol69 through the interface with sharp.
attempts of side-chain docking with respect to the sequence
were performed every 15 cycles and geometry adjustments
were done by refmac70 and constrained by the sharp
phase distribution.
structure refinement was completed using the program
buster71,72 and interfaced with tnt.73 the core of this
program implements statistical treatment of both experimental and model structure factors according to the
maximum-likelihood and maximum-entropy methods.71
the first part of the process was driven by the maximum
likelihood refinement of the atomic parameters of the
incomplete {poly-gly,-ala,-ser} arpwarp model. sir(as)
phase information output by sharp as the hendricksonlattman coefficients constrained the partial structure
refinement whose stereochemical and geometrical
restraints were handled in tnt.
during the atomic parameter refinement process, bulk
solvent and the random distribution of missing atoms
were kept fixed. the missing atoms were utilized as a
model-based non-uniform prior to output low-resolution
distributions and together with the bulk solvent envelope and the fragment model, accounted for the realspace picture of the crystal content. maximum-entropy
modulation of the envelope for missing atoms aims at
recovering accurate density in their expected regions.
although measured amplitudes did not exceed 2.5 å of
resolution, the overlapped part of |2fo–fc, phirefined model|

and |fo–fc, phirefined model|electron densities that delineates
the solvent boundary was checked continuously during the
refinement process for strongly protein-bound molecules.
few (55) water molecules were included in the model with
confidence, as they were (for most of them) already present
in the 2.2 å atp complex, id pdb code  xxxd83xxx .
the aqp was refined with restrained topology and
parameter files established by xplo2d74 and atomic bfactors were kept correlated. at the end of the refinement,
ligand occupancy was refined until convergence after
keeping all coordinates and atomic b-values fixed, those
for the ligand were set equal to the overall b-value of the
protein region surrounding the ligand. refinement came
up with an occupancy value of 0.85. this was followed by
another round b-factor refinement (overall value nearly
the same as the protein backbone), individual atomic
values increasing toward the flexible phosphate tail,
attaining almost 60 å2 for the delta-phosphate.
two catalytic water molecules, the one (w541;5sigma) that
interacts with the hydroxyl group o3′ of the ribose and
that (w5113; 6.5sigma) that bridges the hydroxyl of thr15 with
an oxygen of a nucleotide phosphate (beta-phosphate in
the atp binary complex) were not among the top list
peaks in the difference fo–fc fourier map after protein
model completion. they were nevertheless conserved in
the final model with b-factor values refined to reasonable
values (< 47 å2).
on the top of the list was a strong, round (12sigma) peak of
density showing up in the cationic site previously
noticed.15 this was modelled as a caesium cation that
diffused during crystal post-soaking. a low occupancy
(0.3) was attributed to this very heavy atom element to
comply with the sharp refinement statistics and also
with a reasonable value of refined thermal parameter. its
coordination sphere is four in this complex, making short
interactions (≤3.5 å) with three carbonyl oxygen atoms of
q30, y33 and 74.  xxxd684xxx  and n34 amide groups, sulphur
atoms from met 1 (and possibly that of c35) are also in the
vicinity of the cation. the potential of this site to offer
variable coordination sphere and chemical nature of
neighbors, o, n or s suggests that a large variety of
cations could be accommodated, and we previously have
identified k+ at this site in crystals grown from potassium
salts. however, the present result contrasts to some extent
with weak evidence for sodium binding in the binary atp
complex crystallized in sodium citrate. although this
cation function is likely to be structural (this site is located
far from the adenylation site, in the first half of the rf
domain in a pocket created by two helices that connect
the c terminus of helix alphaa to the beta-strand b on one side
and the c terminus of helix alphab to the beta-strand c on the
other, additional mono or di-valent metal-dependent

activities of b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  should be worth
being investigated.
another residual, significant (9sigma) feature in the fourier
difference was located in the tryptophan-binding pocket,
addressing again the issue of contamination of the trp
pocket. this density was fitted as hexylammonium, the
counterion of commercially supplied aqp, with the
aliphatic group within the hydrophobic cavity, and the
carboxylic group of the trp-binding determinant,  xxxd132xxx 
directed to the ammonium group.
statistics at the completion of the model refinement are
given in table 6. the final crystallographic r-free is equal
to 25.8 and the r-factor is 19.1 for all data between 20.0
and 2.5 å resolution. the standard deviation on coordinates estimated from the cruickshank approach within
sfcheck75 is 0.5 å. agreement between the model and
the sigmaa 2fo–fc final map is assessed by an overall
real-space correlation coefficient of 0.85 calculated by the
macro rs_fit within o. a plot of these coefficients for each
residue is displayed in figure 4 in relation with the
corresponding main chain temperature factors. geometry
of the model was analysed by procheck,76 revealing
that almost 93% of residues in the structure are in the most
favored regions of the ramachandran plot (figure 2). for
purposes of coordinate comparisons, all the models were
superimposed by lsqkab using 42 calpha atoms taken from
the first half of the rf domain, which has been used as a
reference orientation for previous comparisons among
class i aarss (doublié et al, 1995). color figures were
