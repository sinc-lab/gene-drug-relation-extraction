inotropic effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants in isolated canine heart muscle.  the inotropic effects of five non-depolarizing muscle relaxants were examined using an isolated canine heart muscle preparation. except for fazadinium, all drugs were studied in their commercially available forms. d- xxxd3456xxx  chloride (dtc) and  xxxd2626xxx  (mtc) produced dose-dependent decreases in isometric force (f) and the maximum velocity of force development (df/dt) at concentrations greater than 22.5 x 10(-3) g/l for dtc and greater than 15.0 x 10(-3) g/l for mtc, concentrations which are 3 and 6 times higher than estimated clinical serum concentrations, respectively. myocardial depression was about 3 times less with mtc than with dtc at equipotent concentrations. the degree of depression in f and df/dt produced by mtc was almost identical with that produced by phenol, a preservative of mtc, indicating that mtc-induced myocardial depression may be due to the effect of the preservative. pancuronium bromide (pc) produced a dose-dependent increase in f and df/dt and decrease in the time to peak force. pc-induced changes in f, df/dt, and time to peak force were inhibited by administration of propranolol 10(-6) m. the results indicate that pc possesses a positive inotropic effect mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation. alcuronium chloride did not change f or df/dt at concentrations from 5.0 x 10(-3) to 60.0 x 10(-3) g/l. frazadinium bromide increased f and df/ dt slightly at a low concentration (1.875 x 10(-2) g/l), but further increases in its concentration returned the values of f and df/dt to control levels. f and df/dt were not altered in vitro by concentrations of relaxants that would be anticipated in plasma in vivo in patients given clinically effective doses of 0.3 mg/kg of dtc, 0.1 mg/kg of mtc or pc, 0.2 mg/kg of alcuronium chloride, or 0.75 mg/kg of fazadinium bromide.
