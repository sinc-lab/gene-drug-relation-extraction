abstract:  xxxg913xxx  adenylyltranferase ( xxxg1808xxx ,  xxxg2261xxx ) catalyzes the adenylylation and
deadenylylation of  xxxg913xxx  (gs), regulating gs activity. the adenylyltransferase (at) reaction
is activated by glutamine and by the unmodified form of the pii signal transduction protein and is inhibited
by the uridylylated form of pii, pii-ump. conversely, the adenylyl-removing (ar) reaction is activated
by pii-ump and is inhibited by glutamine and by pii. both at and ar reactions are regulated by
r-ketoglutarate, which binds to pii and pii-ump. here, we present a kinetic analysis of the at and ar
activities and their regulation. both at and ar reactions used a sequential mechanism of rapid equilibrium
random binding of substrates and products. activators and inhibitors had little effect on the binding of
substrates, instead exerting their effects on catalysis. our results were consistent with pii, pii-ump, and
glutamine shifting the enzyme among at least six different enzyme forms, two of which were inactive,
one of which exhibited ar activity, and three of which exhibited at activity. in addition to a site for
glutamine, the enzyme appeared to contain two distinct sites for pii and pii-ump. the pii, pii-ump,
and glutamine sites were in communication so that the apparent activation and inhibition constants for
regulators depended upon each other. the binding of pii was favored by glutamine and its level reduced
by pii-ump, whereas glutamine and pii-ump competed for the enzyme. r-ketoglutarate, which acts
exclusively through its binding to pii and pii-ump, did not alter the binding of pii or pii-ump to the
enzyme. rather, r-ketoglutarate dramatically affected the extent of activation or inhibition of the enzyme
by pii or pii-ump. a working hypothesis for the regulation of the at and ar activities, consistent with
all data, is presented.

 xxxg1808xxx  regulates the activity of  xxxg913xxx  (gs)1
in response to intracellular signals of nitrogen status by
catalyzing the reversible adenylylation of gs on tyrosine 397
(reviewed in ref 1). the adenylylation of gs results in a
reduction in gs activity, while deadenylylation of gs∼amp
restores full activity. these reactions play a role in both shortterm and long-term adaptation to changes in nitrogen
availability (2, 3). adenylylation and deadenylylation are
distinct reactions; adenylylation utilizes atp and produces
gs∼amp and ppi, while deadenylylation is a phosphorolysis
in which pi and gs∼amp are converted to gs and adp.
since gs is a dodecamer of identical subunits, there are 13
possible states of adenylylation of the enzyme corresponding
to 0-12 adenylyl groups per dodecamer. it is thought that
the effects of adenylylation of subunits are independent and
additive (1). furthermore, it is thought that the rate of

adenylylation and deadenylylation of subunits in the gs
dodecamer is independent of the status of the other subunits.
that is, adenylylation did not exhibit apparent processivity
(4). the  xxxg1808xxx  provided the first example of signal transduction by reversible adenylylation (5, 6) and provided an
important example of signal transduction by a bicyclic
cascade mechanism (7, 8).
the 946-amino acid  xxxg1808xxx , the product of glne, contains
two copies of a highly conserved motif shared by other
nucleotidyltransferase enzymes, designated the nt domain
(9), as well as a central region of ∼200 amino acids. the
c-terminal nt domain contains the at active site, and the
n-terminal nt domain contains the ar active site (see ref
10). structure-function studies of the enzyme suggested that
the enzyme contained two sites for pii/pii-ump as well as
a site for glutamine and that communication between the
pii site and the glutamine site required interactions involving
both nt domains (10). a hypothesis for the organization
and regulation of the enzyme was presented (10). in this
report, we use kinetic approaches to further investigate the
regulation of the enzyme, with a specific emphasis on testing
the roles of activators and inhibitors and their interactions
and the number of pii/pii-ump sites.
earlier studies suggested that the  xxxg1808xxx  can adopt multiple
enzyme conformations, one of which is inactive, one of

which exhibits ar activity, and three of which exhibit at
activity (8, 11). the at reaction is activated synergistically
by (unmodified) pii and by glutamine, and each of these
activators reduces the apparent activation constant (kact) for
the other (8). this suggested that pii and glutamine stabilize
each other’s binding to the enzyme and promote the
conversion of the enzyme to the form with high at activity
(8). in the presence of just one of these activators (pii or
glutamine), the enzyme exhibits less potent at activity,
perhaps signifying that in the presence of just one of these
activators, the enzyme is less stably converted to the
conformation with at activity or that it is converted to a
form with reduced at activity. similarly, the ar activity
requires pii-ump as an essential activator (8), suggesting
that pii-ump might be required to convert the enzyme to
the conformation with ar activity. since the unactivated
enzyme exhibits neither at nor ar activity, it must be able
to adopt an “inactive” conformation. an alternative explanation for the effects of activators and inhibitors is that these
could more intimately affect the catalytic activities, for
instance, by affecting the binding of substrates.
pii proteins are among the most widely distributed signal
transduction proteins in nature; these small homotrimeric
proteins bind to r-ketoglutarate and to atp and regulate
receptors that are signal transduction enzymes, such as
 xxxg1808xxx , or key metabolic enzymes (12). the activity of
escherichia coli pii for activation of  xxxg1808xxx  is regulated by
the binding of r-ketoglutarate and atp to pii (13). when
the level of atp is saturating, the binding of r-ketoglutarate
displays negative cooperativity; the binding of the first
effector molecule to the trimer inhibits further effector
binding. at physiological concentrations of r-ketoglutarate,
this anticooperativity is overcome, and the pii trimer is
saturated with r-ketoglutarate. the ability of pii to activate
the at activity was best at concentrations of r-ketoglutarate
corresponding to unsaturated pii trimers (8). conversely, the
ability of pii-ump to activate the ar activity was best at
concentrations of r-ketoglutarate that are expected to saturate
the three r-ketoglutarate sites of the pii-ump trimer (8, 13).
these observations suggested that r-ketoglutarate regulated
the binding of pii and pii-ump to  xxxg1808xxx  and, by analogy,
to the other pii receptors (8). we also investigated this issue.
experimental procedures
purified proteins.  xxxg1808xxx  and pii were purified as described previously (8), and preparations of utase/ur
described previously were used (15). gs was purified as
described previously (8), using an overexpression system that
was kindly provided by m. atkinson in which the e. coli
glna structural gene was cloned into the pjla503 expression
plasmid (16). gs∼amp was prepared as described in ref
10, and the preparations of the atm∆ and atc1 mutant
forms of  xxxg1808xxx  described previously (10) were used.

7.5), 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.3 mm r-ketoglutarate,
0.5 mm atp, 2 mm utp, 10 mm dtt, 10 µm pii, and
0.1 µm utase/ur, and reaction mixtures were incubated at
30 °c for 40 min and then heated at 60 °c for 15 min to
inactivate the utase/ur. the samples were then purified
via chromatography on small g-25 columns to exchange the

measurement of at and ar activities. these assays were
essentially as described previously (8, 10). for the at assay,
general conditions included 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 100
mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
0.5 mm [r-32p]atp or as indicated, gs as indicated
(concentration stated in dodecamers), 0.05 mm r-ketoglutarate or as indicated, and  xxxg1808xxx  as indicated. other
additions, such as regulators, products, or substrate analogues,
were as indicated. incubation was carried out at 30 °c, and
aliquots at different times were spotted onto nitrocellulose
filters and washed immediately in 5% tca as described
previously (8). radioactivity on the filters was quantified
by liquid scintillation counting, and initial velocities were
determined by linear regression using kaleidagraph. for the
ar assay, the general conditions included 50 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5), 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine
 xxxg124xxx , [32p]gs∼amp as indicated (stated as a
monomer concentration), kpi as indicated, 1 mm atp or
as indicated, 1 mm r-ketoglutarate or as indicated,  xxxg1808xxx 
as indicated, 0.4 µm pii-ump or as indicated, and other
regulators as indicated. (gs∼amp concentrations are stated
as the monomer concentration because these concentrations
were directly determined by measurement of the amount of

p incorporated into gs∼amp; in all experiments, the
gs∼amp preparations were modified on >95% of the gs
subunits.) incubation was carried out at 30 °c, and at various
times, samples were spotted into nitrocellulose filters and
treated as described above, with initial velocities again
determined using linear regression in kaleidagraph.

results
both at and ar activities utilized a sequential reaction
mechanism. the at reaction catalyzes the conversion of gs
and atp to ppi and gs∼amp. our assay directly measures
the level of incorporation of labeled amp onto gs and has
fairly low noise (ranging from ∼0.1 to 1% of the activity
observed when the enzyme is maximally activated). in earlier
work, we failed to detect a covalent enzyme-amp intermediate using [r-32p]atp as a substrate (in the presence
and absence of gs), consistent with a sequential mechanism.
to directly examine the mechanism, we measured the initial
rate of gs adenylylation as one substrate was varied in the
presence of different fixed concentrations of the second
substrate [s1 vs s2 experiment, figure 1 (18)]. for this, the
at activity was activated by pii in the absence of glutamine,
with r-ketoglutarate at a concentration that favors the at
activity. atp is one of the substrates, but it should be noted
that it is also an activator in these reactions, as binding of
atp to pii appears to be required for all activities of pii
(13). however, at the r-ketoglutarate concentration that was
used, atp binds much better to pii than to the substrate
site of  xxxg1808xxx , allowing us to observe its effects as a substrate.
a pattern of clearly intersecting lines whose intersection point
was to the left of the 1/v axis and very near the 1/s axis was
obtained, indicating a sequential mechanism and suggesting

figure 1: s1 vs s2 experiments indicated a sequential mechanism for the at and ar activities. for the at activity (left), the  xxxg1808xxx 
concentration was 0.05 µm, the r-ketoglutarate concentration 0.05 mm, and the pii concentration 1 µm. gs concentrations were 0.5, 1,
2, and 4 µm (dodecamers), and atp concentrations were 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mm. for the ar activity (right), the  xxxg1808xxx  concentration
was 0.03 µm, the pii-ump concentration 0.3 µm, the atp concentration 1 mm, and the r-ketoglutarate concentration 1 mm. kpi
concentrations were 0.15, 0.35, 0.8, and 2 mm, and gs∼amp concentrations were 1, 2, 4, and 8 µm (subunit concentration).

that the substrates have a modest effect on each other’s
binding (18). the km for the substrates was directly measured
under a few conditions, as summarized in table 1. as shown,
the substrates seemed to have a slightly antagonistic interaction (table 1).
the ar activity catalyzes the conversion of gs∼amp
and pi to gs and adp. our assay measures the rate of
cleavage of labeled amp from gs∼amp and has relatively
low noise (∼5% of the maximally activated rate). prior
studies failed to identify a covalent enzyme-amp intermediate, and here we directly examined the ar mechanism by
conducting the s1 versus s2 experiment in the presence of
pii-ump and the concentrations of r-ketoglutarate and atp
(1 mm each) that favor ar activity (figure 1). again, a
pattern of intersecting lines was obtained, whose point of
intersection is to the left of the 1/v axis and near the 1/s
axis. this is consistent with a sequential mechanism and very
modest substrate effects on each other (figure 1). direct km
measurements for the ar reaction are presented in table 1.
product inhibition studies suggested that both the at and
ar reactions utilized rapid equilibrium random binding
of substrates and products. to help determine the order of
substrate binding and product release, we examined the
inhibition patterns of each substrate versus each product for
both the at and ar activities. in each case, we used the

conditions described for the s1 versus s2 experiments,
favoring the appropriate activity. in the case of the at
activity, we saw an apparent competitive pattern of inhibition
for each product versus each substrate (figure 2). the
distinction between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition patterns is frequently difficult. additional evidence of
a random rapid equilibrium mechanism came from the
observation that a high concentration of either substrate (gs
or atp) eliminated inhibition by either product (figure s1
of the supporting information). for the ar activity, we again
saw an apparent competitive inhibition pattern for each
product versus each substrate (figure 3), and we observed
that high concentrations of pi could block inhibition by either
product (figure s2 of the supporting information). for
technical reasons, it was not practical to try to use very high
gs∼amp concentrations to block product inhibition. thus,
for both at and ar activities, the data were consistent with
a random rapid equilibrium mechanism. all inhibition
patterns seemed to be linear, and there was no apparent
evidence for dead-end complexes or substrate inhibition.
additional studies to confirm the mechanism would typically
utilize analogues for each substrate. unfortunately, we were
unable to identify a suitable analogue for gs and gs∼amp,
but we did observe that gtp could inhibit the at activity.
this inhibition appeared to be competitive with atp and

products, affect the rate of catalysis, or influence reaction
rates in multiple ways. to investigate the role of activators
and inhibitors in our initial rate studies, we examined the
patterns of inhibition when each substrate was varied in the
presence of different fixed concentrations of inhibitor(s) or

activator(s), for both the at and ar reactions (figure 4 and
figures s3-s5 of the supporting information). for the at
activity, studies were conducted with either glutamine or pii
as the sole activator. in all cases, both slope and 1/v0 intercept
effects were observed, and the inhibitor or activator had little

effect on the 1/s intercept of the lineweaver-burke plots.
intuitively, such results suggest that the activators and
inhibitors cannot have significant effects on substrate binding,
since the 1/s intercept is -1/ks as modified by the effects
of activators and inhibitors (18). in the supporting information, we use the approach described by segel (pp 274-291
of ref 18) to examine the significance of the 1/s intercept
for three different types of systems with activators and
inhibitors; as expected, in all three cases, 1/s intercept effects
were predicted when activators and inhibitors affected
substrate binding.
regulation by r-ketoglutarate. both at and ar activities
require r-ketoglutarate when they are activated by pii and
pii-ump, respectively, with low r-ketoglutarate concentrations favoring activation of the at by pii and high
r-ketoglutarate concentrations favoring activation of the ar
by pii-ump (8). when the initial rate of the at reaction
was measured with pii as the activator (in the absence of
glutamine) and at various r-ketoglutarate concentrations, a
biphasic response to r-ketoglutarate was observed (figure
5a). adenylylation was favored by a very low concentration
of r-ketoglutarate (with an optimum effector concentration
of ∼10 µm), and activation by pii was nearly eliminated at
1 mm r-ketoglutarate. when pii-ump was present, the at
activity was significantly inhibited (figure 5a), with the
inhibition most severe at high concentrations of r-ketoglutarate. this effect shifted the optimal r-ketoglutarate concentration to a lower value when pii-ump was present
(figure 5a). the biphasic saturation profile for pii is
consistent with its activation and inactivation by r-ketoglutarate.
when both glutamine and pii were present, the at activity
was strongly activated. when the concentration of glutamine
was below its apparent kact (in the absence of pii), the
response to r-ketoglutarate was still biphasic, as seen
previously (8), but the rate and saturation profile were
broader because the ascending arm starts from a higher
position because of activation by glutamine and pii in the
absence of r-ketoglutarate (figure 5b). however, when a
saturating concentration of glutamine was present, the
enzyme was fully activated in the absence of r-ketoglutarate,
and r-ketoglutarate at very high concentrations provided only
weak inhibition of the at activity (figure 5c). thus, the

interaction between pii and glutamine could compensate for
inhibitory effects of r-ketoglutarate at high concentrations
and eliminate the need for the activating effect of r-ketoglutarate at low concentrations.
the results described in the previous paragraph led us to
examine directly whether pii and glutamine displayed an
interaction in the absence of r-ketoglutarate and in the
presence of very high r-ketoglutarate concentrations. in the
absence of either glutamine or pii, the basal rate of the at
activity is insignificant. when pii and glutamine were present
at the optimal r-ketoglutarate concentration, the at rate was
considerably greater than that obtained with either activator
alone (figure 6). in the absence of r-ketoglutarate and at
very high r-ketoglutarate concentrations, the combination
of pii and glutamine again resulted in rates higher than that
explained by additive effects (figure 5). indeed, in these two
cases, pii alone barely activated the  xxxg1808xxx  yet functioned
in concert with glutamine. furthermore, even when the
 xxxg1808xxx  was saturated with glutamine (50 mm), pii was able
to further activate the at reaction (figure 6).
the apparent kact for pii activation of the at reaction
depended on the glutamine concentration (table 2), as noted
previously (8). in the presence of saturating glutamine
concentrations, the apparent kact for pii was 50-100-fold
lower than that observed in the absence of glutamine (table
2). by comparison, the apparent kact for glutamine was
reduced ∼14-fold in the presence of a high concentration of
pii (table 2). both of these kact values should be modified
by the same r factor (see figure 12 below); that is, the
synergy should be symmetrical, and thus, the discrepancy
probably reflects the fact that it is easier to provide a
saturating concentration of glutamine than of pii. remarkably, although r-ketoglutarate dramatically regulated pii
activation of the at activity (e.g., figure 5a), it did not
have a significant effect on the pii apparent kact (table 2)
when pii activation was examined in the absence of piiump and glutamine. this result is not consistent with a
hypothesis that r-ketoglutarate regulates the binding of pii
to  xxxg1808xxx , for in that case a dramatic effect on kact would be
expected.
the ar activity is activated by pii-ump, and this
activation requires r-ketoglutarate and is favored by a high
concentration of r-ketoglutarate (8). we examined the

apparent kact for pii-ump in the presence of high and low
concentrations of r-ketoglutarate and found that r-ketoglutarate had a very minor effect on the pii-ump apparent kact
(table 3). again, this observation is inconsistent with
r-ketoglutarate regulating the binding of the activator (piiump) to the enzyme.

figure 7: glutamine apparent kact values for activation of the at
activity depended on the r-ketoglutarate concentration when pii
was present. conditions included 0.01 µm  xxxg1808xxx , 3 µm gs, 0.5
mm atp, and 15 µm pii. r-ketoglutarate concentrations were
0.05 (0), 0 (o), and 1 mm (]), and the apparent glutamine kact
values were 0.45, 1.1, and 2.6 mm, respectively.

despite the fact that r-ketoglutarate seemed to have little
effect on the apparent kact of pii and pii-ump for the at
and ar reactions, this effector did affect the apparent kact
of glutamine for activation of the at activity in the presence
of pii (figure 7). the effect of r-ketoglutarate was again
biphasic, with the optimal effector concentration for enzyme
activation corresponding to the lowest apparent kact for
glutamine. this is consistent with the hypothesis that pii
facilitates the binding of glutamine to the enzyme, and
r-ketoglutarate influences the interaction of pii with the
enzyme. at the optimal r-ketoglutarate concentration, pii
is most effective in converting the enzyme to the form that
binds glutamine more avidly.
although r-ketoglutarate did not have a dramatic effect
on the pii and pii-ump kact when these activators were
present separately, it clearly affected the interaction between
pii and pii-ump when both were present. at high r-ketoglutarate concentrations, pii-ump was a much more effective
inhibitor of the pii-activated at reaction than it was at low
r-ketoglutarate concentrations (table 2), and correspondingly, r-ketoglutarate controlled the pii kact in the presence
of pii-ump. a possible explanation for these data is that

included 0.02 µm  xxxg1808xxx , 3 µm gs, 3 mm atp, and 0.05 mm r-ketoglutarate. pii-ump concentrations were 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 3 µm. (b)

pii-ump, and the top line is for data with 3 µm pii-ump. (d) inhibition of the pii-ump-activated ar activity by pii. conditions included
0.06 µm  xxxg1808xxx , 3 µm gs∼amp, and 1 mm atp. the kpi concentration was 0.4 mm and the r-ketoglutarate concentration 1 mm. pii
concentrations were 0, 4, 8, and 12 µm.

r-ketoglutarate, while not directly affecting the binding of
either pii or pii-ump to the enzyme, regulates the ability
of pii and pii-ump to convert the enzyme to the form that
binds the other species less avidly. that is, the r factor
describing the interaction of pii and pii-ump (r2 in figure
12, below) must be sensitive to r-ketoglutarate.
interactions of pii, pii-ump, and glutamine. to examine
the interactions of pii and pii-ump, we examined the effect
of varying activator concentrations at different fixed inhibitor
concentrations (a vs i experiment) for both the at and ar
reactions (figure 8). in both cases, we saw a clearly
noncompetitve inhibition pattern. in the case of the at
reaction, it could be considered that in experiments conducted
at low r-ketoglutarate concentrations, the activator (pii) and
inhibitor (pii-ump) sequester the effector and thus alter the
concentration of the free effector (figure 8a). of course,
this cannot explain the noncompetitive inhibition patterns
at high r-ketoglutarate concentrations (figure 8b). to
examine the interaction of pii and pii-ump at low r-ketoglutarate concentrations, another experiment was performed
in which the concentration of free r-ketoglutarate was kept
constant throughout the experiment. again, a noncompetitive
inhibition pattern was obtained (figure 8c). these results

are not consistent with a hypothesis whereby pii and piiump act from a single common site or where each converts
the enzyme to a form that does not bind the other, for in
that case we would expect a competitive inhibition pattern.
for the ar experiment, r-ketoglutarate was present at a high
concentration so that the noncompetitive inhibition by pii
cannot be explained by titration of the effector (figure 8d).
as noted above when focusing upon r-ketoglutarate
effects, we also examined the interaction of pii and piiump by determining the kact for the activating species in
the presence of the inhibiting species (tables 2 and 3). for
the at activity, the influence of pii-ump on the pii apparent
kact depended on the r-ketoglutarate concentration: at low
r-ketoglutarate concentrations, an ∼6-fold increase in the
apparent pii kact was observed in the presence of 10 µm
pii-ump, and at high r-ketoglutarate concentrations, an
∼20-fold increase in the pii apparent kact was observed when
the pii-ump concentration was 10 µm (table 2). considerably more modest effects were observed when we examined
the effect of pii on the activation of the ar by pii-ump at
high r-ketoglutarate concentrations. in that case, pii increased the apparent pii-ump kact ∼2-fold (table 3). we
found it impractical to measure the effect of pii on the pii-

ump kact at low r-ketoglutarate concentrations, as it was
difficult to assess the inhibition of the low ar activity under
these conditions, and the experiment again requires careful
control of the free r-ketoglutarate concentration to prevent
the titration of the effector.
additional information about the interaction of pii and
pii-ump comes from the examination of the inhibition of
the ar by pii under different conditions (table 4). the
apparent inhibition constant for pii was increased ∼10-fold
when pii-ump was present at a high concentration, consistent with the hypothesis that pii and pii-ump act to force
the enzyme into conformations that bind the other species
less avidly.
in contrast to the noncompetitive inhibition patterns
obtained in pii versus pii-ump experiments, competitive
patterns of inhibition were observed when glutamine and piiump were in opposition (figure 9). this was observed both
for the inhibition of the glutamine-activated  xxxg1808xxx  activity
by pii-ump (figure 9a) and for the inhibition of the piiump-activated ar activity by glutamine (figure 9b). while
we think it is unlikely that the binding sites for pii-ump
and glutamine are identical, these results are consistent with
a hypothesis that the enzyme can bind only one of these
regulators and that the form bound by pii-ump lacks the
at activity while the form bound by glutamine lacks the
ar activity.
further support for the idea that pii-ump and glutamine
binding are antagonistic comes from the examination of the
regulation of atc1, a truncated form of  xxxg1808xxx  that lacks
the n-terminal ar domain (10). this truncated form of the
 xxxg1808xxx  is activated by glutamine, but it is not activated by
pii. rather, pii and pii-ump both inhibit the at activity
of atc1, presumably by binding to a site corresponding to
the natural pii-ump site (10). we examined the inhibition
of the atc1 at activity as the glutamine concentration was
varied at several different fixed inhibitor (pii or pii-ump)
concentrations (a vs i experiments); for both pii and piiump, the inhibition appeared to be competitive with
glutamine (figure 10a,b). furthermore, the inhibition by
pii and pii-ump appeared to be additive, as if they were
acting from a common site, as indicated by a series of parallel
lines in the dixon plot as one inhibitor was varied in the
presence of different fixed concentrations of the other (figure
10c). these results are consistent with glutamine (activator)

and pii-ump/pii (inhibitors) competing to convert the
enzyme to forms that bind only either an activator or an
inhibitor (supporting information).
in addition to the data presented above, direct measurement
of the glutamine apparent kact for activation of the at
activity in the presence and absence of pii-ump indicated
that pii-ump increases the glutamine kact ∼2-fold when the
r-ketoglutarate concentration was low and up to 4-fold when
the r-ketoglutarate concentration was high (table 2). for
the pii-ump-activated ar activity, a saturating glutamine
concentration increased the apparent kact for pii-ump ∼3fold (table 3). these results are consistent with the hypothesis of distinct enzyme forms that bind glutamine and piiump (at the ar-activating site), but we were somewhat
surprised by the relatively low magnitude of the effects on
the apparent kact.
additional evidence of the competition between glutamine
and pii-ump can be discerned from the effect of the piiump concentration on the apparent glutamine kinhib for
inhibition of the ar activity. when the ar activity was
activated by fairly low concentrations of pii-ump (0.4 or
0.5 µm), the glutamine apparent kinhib was ∼23 mm; this
value was increased to ∼90 mm when the pii-ump
concentration was increased to 10 µm (table 4).
to begin to understand the interplay among pii-ump, pii,
and glutamine when all three of these regulators were present,
we studied the activation and inhibition of the at and ar
activities. for the at activity, the a versus i plots in the
presence of a fixed level of the second a were nonlinear,
reflecting the synergistic activation of the at by pii and
glutamine (figure s6 of the supporting information). although the inhibition of the ar by the combination of pii
and glutamine was synergistic, it appeared to be decidedly
less so than that was observed for activation of the at
activity (figure s7 of the supporting information). nevertheless, the synergy between glutamine and pii had an obvious
effect on the apparent kact and kinhib for the at and ar
activities. for example, when the glutamine concentration
was saturating and the r-ketoglutarate concentration was low,
pii-ump had no significant effect on the pii apparent kact
(table 2). furthermore, at less than saturating concentrations,
glutamine could offset the effect of pii-ump on the pii
apparent kact (table 2). for the ar activity, the combination
of pii and glutamine increased the apparent pii-ump kact
∼6-fold, whereas either inhibitor alone had a fairly modest
effect (table 3). also, pii and glutamine significantly
reduced the apparent kinhib for each other for inhibition of
the ar activity; pii reduced the apparent kinhib of glutamine
∼4-fold, and glutamine decreased the apparent kinhib of pii
∼5-fold (table 4). taken together, these data are consistent
with a hypothesis that pii and glutamine stabilize each other’s
binding and that glutamine and pii-ump antagonize each
other’s binding, leading to partitioning of the enzyme into
at and ar active conformations. with regard to physiological significance, we note that the glutamine kact that
we observe in the absence of pii (table 2) is significantly
higher than the reported concentrations of glutamine in
nitrogen-rich cells (19, 20), suggesting that synergism with
pii plays an important role in regulation of the enzyme by
glutamine in vivo.

acids from the central region linking the ar and at domains
(10). this enzyme lacked ar activity but had a significant
at basal activity, which was activated by glutamine and

inhibited by pii and by pii-ump. interestingly, in the
presence of glutamine, the level of inhibition by pii-ump
was greatly reduced, but inhibition by pii was not (10). since
the atm∆ enzyme has significant basal at activity, this

allowed the interaction between pii and pii-ump to be
studied in a simpler system. for example, if pii and piiump bind to a common site or if their binding to the enzyme
is strictly competitive such that only one could be bound at
any given time, then the dixon plot where one inhibitor is
varied in the presence of different fixed concentrations of
the other must be linear and give a series of parallel lines
(supporting information). conversely, a linear and noncompetitive pattern is expected in the dixon plot when there are
distinct sites for the two inhibitors, and they can both be
simultaneously bound to the enzyme (supporting information). indeed, more complex arrangements can be imagined,
where each inhibitor binds, with different affinities, to two
sites, that is, where the site specificity is relaxed. these also
give rise to noncompetitive dixon plots, but the lines can
have various curvature depending upon the degree to which
site specificity has been relaxed (supporting information).
we therefore conducted the i1 versus i2 experiment for
inhibition of the basal at activity of the atm∆ enzyme;
the dixon plots appeared to be linear, and there was a small
but significant slope effect, that is, a noncompetitive pattern
(figure 11). this is consistent with pii and pii-ump binding
to independent sites with reasonable specificity in the absence

of glutamine and suggests the existence of the ternary
complex with both inhibitors bound to the enzyme.
we also examined the inhibition of the atm∆ at activity
by pii and by pii-ump in the presence of glutamine.
interestingly, pii provided approximately noncompetitive
inhibition, as expected, except that there was a slight
curvature to the lines (figure s8a). on the basis of the 1/v0
intercepts and assuming that the parameters from the tables
(obtained with the wild-type enzyme) apply, a value of r1,
describing the interaction of pii and glutamine, of ∼0.05
can be extracted from the kinetic plot (see figure 12 and
supporting information). thus, the atm∆ mutant enzyme
is rather curious in that the binding of the activator
(glutamine) appears to make one of the inhibitors (pii) bind
better. inhibition by pii-ump was nonlinear (figure s8b).
when the pii-ump concentration was 5 µm, glutamine could
almost completely overcome inhibition by pii-ump. however, when the pii-ump concentration was 15 µm, the
inhibition was reminiscent of that seen with pii and perhaps
was due to binding of pii-ump to the natural pii site.
a minimal model for the regulation of the at and ar
activities. since the activators and inhibitors did not appear
to affect the binding of substrates yet had dramatic effects

4144 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 13, 2007
in our initial rate studies where no product is present, their
roles appeared to be to partition the enzyme among different
conformations with different activities, and to influence each
other’s binding (figure 12). although the regulation of the
at and ar activities is complex, comfort is obtained from
the constraint that the identical enzyme catalyzes both
activities, and thus, the number of enzyme forms must be
the same for both activities, leading to a minimum model
with six enzyme species. the rate equations for the at and
ar activities derived from this model are presented in the
supporting information. it should be noted that the effects
of r-ketoglutarate are not included in the model; this effector
probably affects r1, r2, kp, kr, and beta′ (figure 12), making it
difficult to globally fit the data from different experiments
performed under different conditions. nevertheless, in some
cases, we could compare parameters extracted from kinetic
plots to those determined directly. for example, data from
figure 9a suggest a kg (kact) for glutamine activation of
the at of 7.8 mm and a ku (kinhib) for pii-ump inhibition
of this activity of 0.35-0.5 µm, similar to the values from
direct measurements (tables 2 and 3). the data from figure
9b suggest a ku of ∼0.2 µm and a kg of 11-15 mm, each
differing from the direct measurements by ∼2-fold. similarly,
kp and ku extracted from panels b and d of figure 8, 0.9
and 0.33 µm, respectively, were similar to the values
obtained by direct measurement (table 3).
less appealingly, attempts to extract r2 from kinetic plots,
describing the interaction of pii and pii-ump (figure 12),
have provided inconsistent results. for example, the data in
panels a and d of figure 8 provide fairly consistent estimates
of r2 between 1.2 and 1.9, but the data in figure 8b provide
a significantly higher estimate of this parameter of 6.8-12.9.
to obtain another estimate of r2, we measured the initial
rate of the at and ar reactions when the pii and pii-ump
concentrations were varied at a constant ratio and with a
constant free r-ketoglutarate concentration. for both activities, a biphasic response to an increasing concentration of
pii and pii-ump was obtained (figure s9 of the supporting
information). appealingly, simulation of the models using
parameters from the tables also resulted in a biphasic
response, but high r2 values (∼10-20) were required for a
good fit to the data (figure s9c). thus, the minimal model
(figure 12) does not fully capture the complexity of the
interaction between pii and pii-ump. we might expect that
pii and pii-ump can each bring about a variety of enzyme
forms, depending on the r-ketoglutarate concentration as
well as whether the other is bound and whether glutamine
is bound.
fitting data to the model and estimation of parameters.
to probe r1 describing the interaction of pii and glutamine
and estimate the catalytic activity of the enzyme bound to
pii, glutamine, or both, we examined the at rate as the pii
concentration was varied at different glutamine concentrations (a1 vs a2 experiment, figure s10 of the supporting
information). these data were globally fit reasonably well
to the model as described in the supporting information (rms
error ) 0.227), providing the parameters listed in the figure
legend of figure s10. the kg so determined (15.6 mm) is
∼2-fold higher than from direct measurement, and the kp
so determined, 0.18 µm, is ∼6-fold lower than that from
direct measurement. the results predict that the synergy
between glutamine and pii is due both to their effects on

jiang et al.
each other’s binding (r1 ) 0.17) and to the very high activity
of the enzyme form bound by both effectors.
for further analysis of the model, we chose six experimental data sets, employing a variety of conditions, and
globally fit the data to the model as described in the
supporting information. our goal was to see whether
reasonably good fits could be obtained, to see whether
parameters were in agreement with data from direct measurement, and, in particular, to obtain estimates of r1 and
r2, describing the interactions of pii with glutamine and with
pii-ump, respectively.
to study the interaction of pii and pii-ump, the experiments shown in panels a, b, and d of figure 8 were globally
fit (figure s11 of the supporting information). in all cases,
reasonably good fits were obtained, and given the different
conditions that were used, the parameters extracted from the
fit were reasonable when compared to those obtained from
direct measurement. the value of r2 from these fits ranged
from 2.17 to 8.85, suggesting that pii and pii-ump have
significant effects on each other’s binding.
to study the interaction of pii-ump and glutamine, the
data from panels a and b of figure 9 were globally fit to
the model. this is a simpler situation, since there is no
interaction between pii and pii-ump and the antagonism
between glutamine and pii-ump is competitive. these data
were fit well by the model, and the extracted parameters were
in good agreement with the values obtained by direct
measurement (figure s12 of the supporting information).
thus, while the model described in figure 12 is obviously
a simplification and does not adequately describe the
interactions of pii and pii-ump with complex effects of
r-ketoglutarate, other aspects of the model fit the experimental data reasonably well.
discussion
the  xxxg1808xxx  is a remarkably complex enzyme, with two
distinct active sites and four regulatory species (pii, piiump, glutamine, and r-ketoglutarate). one unexpected
finding of our studies was that r-ketoglutarate, which
controls pii activation of the at activity and inhibition of
the ar activity and also controls pii-ump activation of the
ar activity and inhibition of the at activity, did not appear
to regulate the binding of pii and pii-ump to the enzyme.
this was revealed as the absence of an effect of r-ketoglutarate on the kact of pii and pii-ump (tables 2 and 3).
apparently, r-ketoglutarate regulated the ability of pii and
pii-ump to exert their influence at a postbinding step; that
is, pii and pii-ump functioned as dissociable regulatory
subunits that mediated regulation by r-ketoglutarate. since
all pii proteins characterized so far bind r-ketoglutarate (12),
this may be a regulatory property shared by other pii proteins
and their receptors.
another unexpected finding was that pii and pii-ump
did not appear to compete for a single site but, rather,
appeared to act from distinct sites. this was revealed as
noncompetitve inhibition patterns when pii and pii-ump
were in opposition, for both the at and ar activities. one
of these sites was apparently located on the fraction of the
protein remaining in the atc1 truncation, which removes
the n-terminal nt (ar) domain, since binding of pii or piiump to this species was able to inhibit the activation of its

kinetic characterization of regulation of  xxxg1808xxx 
at activity by glutamine. apparently, this is the site from
which pii-ump normally activates the ar activity and
inhibits the at activity, with the specificity of the site for
pii-ump relaxed due to the truncation of the rest of the
 xxxg1808xxx  (10). for the wild-type enzyme, the linear noncompetitive patterns obtained in the a versus i experiments where
pii and pii-ump were in antagonism suggest that the two
sites in the wild-type enzyme are fairly specific for pii and
pii-ump; otherwise, nonlinear patterns would be expected.
the atm∆ mutant enzyme provided additional evidence
for distinct pii and pii-ump sites. since this mutant enzyme
is the result of an internal deletion, the mutation is unlikely
to have created a site for pii or pii-ump. the significant
basal at activity of the atm∆ enzyme in the absence of
glutamine allowed us to examine the interaction of pii and
pii-ump in a system with no activators, where the presence
of at least two distinct sites and the presence of the ternary
complex containing enzyme and both inhibitors could be
inferred.
although pii and pii-ump did not compete for a single
site, they did affect each other’s binding to the enzyme. this
was evident in the influence pii and pii-ump had on the
inhibition constant for the other. increasing the concentration
of the activator of either the at or ar activity resulted in
an increase in the apparent kinhib of the inhibitor. further
evidence of an r factor greater than unity (r2 in figure 12)
comes from the analysis of the kinetic plots and from global
fitting of the data from activator versus inhibitor experiments
where pii and pii-ump were in opposition (figure 9) and
from experiments where pii and pii-ump were held at a
fixed ratio and varied simultaneously (figure s9).
in contrast to the situation involving pii and pii-ump,
we were able to observe clear competition between pii-ump
and glutamine for the enzyme, for both at and ar activities,
suggesting that the enzyme exclusively binds either pii-ump
or glutamine. most likely, pii-ump and glutamine bind
distinct sites and cause the enzyme to adopt alternative
conformations. interestingly, when the atc1-truncated form
of  xxxg1808xxx  was examined, either pii or pii-ump competed
with glutamine for the enzyme, and inhibition of the atc1
 xxxg1808xxx  activity seemed to be due to additive effects of pii
and pii-ump binding. this is consistent with the hypothesis
that atc1 contains only the natural pii-ump site, with
reduced specificity. when the at activity of the atm∆
mutant enzyme was studied, glutamine appeared to stimulate
the binding of pii to the enzyme. thus, it appears that pii
inhibits the atm∆ mutant enzyme by binding to the natural
pii site.
the  xxxg1808xxx  appears to be a highly coordinated enzyme in
which all regulatory sites communicate. this is illustrated
by the influence of r-ketoglutarate on the apparent kact of
glutamine for activation of the at activity and on the effects
of r-ketoglutarate and glutamine in experiments where both
pii and pii-ump were allowed to influence the at and ar
activities (tables 2 and 3). we imagine that a given enzyme
molecule is able to display at or ar activity at any given
moment, but never both (figure 12). the coordination of
enzyme activities was further studied in ref 10, where we
hypothesized that the c-terminal at domain of the enzyme
is involved in the activation of the ar activity of the
n-terminal domain (10). this is consistent with the hypothesis that the pii-ump site involved in activation of the ar

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 13, 2007 4145
activity of the n-terminal domain is located on or near the
c-terminal at domain.
the simplest scheme to account for the data available so
far includes six enzyme forms (figure 12). one of these
forms, in which the enzyme is bound to neither pii, piiump, nor glutamine, is inactive for both at and ar
activities. the three enzyme species bound by glutamine,
by pii, and by both pii and glutamine exhibit at activity,
while the enzyme form bound by pii-ump exhibits ar
activity. as a high concentration of pii and pii-ump could
effectively inhibit the ar and at activities, respectively,
when these were activated by pii-ump or pii, it seems that
the enzyme form bound by both pii and pii-ump exhibits
neither activity. at this time, we do not know whether the
enzyme is ever bound by pii or by pii-ump at both of the
pii/pii-ump sites. however, in unpublished experiments,
we did not observe significant inhibition of either the at or
ar activitiy at very high concentrations of the pii or piiump activator, as might be expected if both sites could be
bound by a single species, as long as effector molecules (atp
and r-ketoglutarate) were not subject to titration.
the scheme presented in figure 12 provides possible
explanations of why pii and glutamine were highly synergistic in activation of the at activity but exhibited less
synergy in the inhibition of the pii-ump-activated ar
activity. first, a high value for beta′ (figure 12 and figure s10)
would amplify the effects of synergistic binding of pii and
glutamine in activation of the at activity. second, when
the at activity is activated in the absence of pii-ump, there
is nothing to impede the fomation of the enzyme complex
containing both pii and glutamine, but in the presence of
pii-ump, formation of this complex is impeded both by the
competition between glutamine and pii-ump for the enzyme
and by pii-ump converting the enzyme to a form that binds
pii less avidly. the prediction is that the synergy between
pii and glutamine for activation of the at activity would
be greatly reduced in the presence of pii-ump, and although
we did not systematically study this matter, data presented
in tables 2-4 and figure s6 suggest this is the case.
