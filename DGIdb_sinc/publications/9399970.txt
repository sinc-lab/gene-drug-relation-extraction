discriminative stimulus effects of the mixed-opioid agonist/antagonist  xxxd1864xxx : cross-substitution by mu and delta opioid agonists.  the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the discriminative stimulus effects of the mixed-opioid agonist/antagonist  xxxd1864xxx . in pigeons trained to discriminate 1.7 mg/kg  xxxd1864xxx  from saline, a series of opioids with activity at the  xxxg1635xxx  substituted completely for the  xxxd1864xxx  stimulus with a rank order of potency similar to that obtained in other assays sensitive to the effects of mu agonists (i.e., fentanyl >[-]-cyclazocine >buprenorphine = butorphanol >l-methadone >nalbuphine >[-]-metazocine >morphine). (-)-n-allylnormetazocine and (+)-propoxyphene substituted partially for the  xxxd1864xxx  stimulus, an effect obtained even when tested up to doses that suppressed responding. naloxone (0.1 - 10 mg/kg) antagonized the stimulus effects of  xxxd1864xxx , (+)-propoxyphene and fentanyl in a dose-related manner, whereas doses of naloxone that antagonized fentanyl's rate-decreasing effects failed to antagonize the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd1864xxx  and (+)-propoxyphene. a 10-mg/kg dose of the mu-selective, noncompetitive antagonist beta-funaltrexamine was more effective against the stimulus effects of  xxxd1864xxx  and nalbuphine than against morphine and fentanyl. as was observed with naloxone, beta-funaltrexamine failed to antagonize  xxxd1864xxx 's rate-decreasing effects. the delta agonists bw373u86 and snc80 substituted partially for the  xxxd1864xxx  stimulus, and these effects were reversed by doses of the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) that had no effect on the  xxxd1864xxx  stimulus. naltrindole also antagonized the rate-decreasing effects produced by bw373u86 and snc80, but not those of  xxxd1864xxx . the kappa agonists bremazocine, spiradoline, u50,488 and u69,593 failed to substitute for the  xxxd1864xxx  stimulus. the kappa-selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine (1.0 mg/kg) failed to antagonize  xxxd1864xxx 's stimulus or rate-decreasing effects. the present findings indicate that  xxxd1864xxx  shares similar stimulus effects with both mu and delta agonists, its stimulus effects are reversed by mu-selective antagonists, and its rate-decreasing effects are not mediated by activity at mu, kappa or delta opioid receptors.
