abstract
▲ tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase type 5
inhibitor that is effective in men with mild-to-severe
erectile dysfunction (ed), including those with diabetes mellitus.
▲ the improvement in the erectile function domain
score on the international index of erectile function
(iief) and the percentage of sexual intercourse attempts marked by successful vaginal penetration
and completion was significantly greater with
on-demand (not more than once daily) tadalafil 10
or 20mg than placebo in trials of 12 weeks’ duration. improvement in scores on other domains of the
iief and the percentage of positive responses to a
global assessment question measuring erection
improvement were also significantly greater with
on-demand tadalafil than placebo.
▲ the adverse events associated with tadalafil were
generally mild to moderate and decreased in frequency with continued administration. the most
commonly reported adverse events were headache
and dyspepsia. the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events was not significantly different in
tadalafil or placebo recipients.

tadalafil

erectile dysfunction (ed), defined as the consistent inability to achieve and/or maintain a penile
erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance, is estimated to affect up to 30 million men in
the us.[1] ed is more common with advancing
age[2-4] and may result from a number of age-related
medical conditions (e.g. hypertension or diabetes
mellitus) or use of certain pharmacological agents
(e.g. antiarrhythmics and antihypertensives).[1] ed
is distressing to patients and their partners and has
an adverse effect on quality of life and social relationships.
an important development in the treatment of
ed has been the discovery of drugs that inhibit the
enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5), the first
of which was sildenafil.[5] pde5 is the predominant
 xxxd1274xxx  (cgmp) hydrolysing enzyme in the penile corpus cavernosum.[6,7]
when sexual stimulation causes the local release of
 xxxd2738xxx , inhibition of pde5 enhances the concentration of penile cgmp and potentiates smooth
muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum. the
resultant increased arterial blood flow leads to enlargement of the corpus cavernosum tissue. veins
are compressed between the corpus cavernosum and
the tunica albuginea as a result of the increased
tumescence, and the outflow of blood is reduced.

● tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of pde5. the
concentration of tadalafil that inhibited 50% of the
activity (ic50) of isolated pde5 was 0.9 nmol/l in
an in vitro study (presented as an abstract).[9] the
inhibition of pde5 by tadalafil was 780-fold greater
than that of the retinal enzyme pde6 (ic50 730
nmol/l)[9] and at least 9000-fold greater than that of
other isoforms of human pde (1–4 and 7–10),[9] but
only 5-fold greater than that of pde11.[10] the selectivity of tadalafil for pde5 over  xxxg1695xxx  is important
because  xxxg1695xxx  is an enzyme involved in cardiac
contractility (see section 4).
● tadalafil 30 nmol/l significantly potentiated the
maximum relaxation of human trabecular smooth
muscle induced by transmural electrical stimulation
(67.4% vs 42.4% without tadalafil at 6hz; p <
0.005).[9] in addition, tadalafil 30 nmol/l significantly potentiated sodium nitroprusside-induced accumulation of cgmp in human cavernosal tissue
(0.99 vs 0.47 pmol/mg protein; p < 0.05) and significantly potentiated the relaxation of penile smooth
muscle induced by acetylcholine (p < 0.004).[9]

effects on penile erection

in a proof-of-concept study, the mean increase in
maximum rigidity of the base of the penis was
greater with tadalafil 100mg (15.2%) than placebo
(2.6%; p ≤ 0.008) administration in 44 men with
mild-to-moderate ed.[11] in this double-blind, crossover study (presented as an abstract), the men under●

went rigiscan™ penile plethysmography during
visual sexual stimulation. the increase in rigidity of
the penis at the tip was also greater with tadalafil
100mg than placebo (p ≤ 0.001) administration. the
mean increase in duration of erection (≥55% rigidity
at the base of the penis) was 1.4 minutes in placebo
recipients and 9.3 minutes in recipients of tadalafil
100mg (p ≤ 0.001).[11]
period of responsiveness

european labelling for tadalafil indicates that the
drug may be effective for up to 24 hours.[12] although data on responsiveness beyond 24 hours are
available,[13,14] this section reviews only data up to
this timepoint (i.e. in line with european labelling).
it should be noted that some regional labelling may
differ from europe in this respect.
● the erectile response (≥55% rigidity at the base
of the penis for ≥3 consecutive minutes) was significantly greater with tadalafil 10mg than placebo at 45
minutes (p = 0.034) and at 24 hours (p = 0.001) after
single-dose administration.[15] this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, crossover study (presented
as an abstract and poster) involved 61 men with ed
of ≥3 months’ duration. erectile response was assessed by rigiscan™ penile plethysmography
during visual sexual stimulation. at 24 hours after
dose administration, 59% of tadalafil recipients
compared with 7% of placebo recipients were able
to achieve an erectile response (p = 0.001). at 24
hours after dose administration, the mean cumulative time with an erectile response was 11 minutes
with tadalafil compared with 1 minute with placebo
(p = 0.001).[15]
● at 16 minutes after dosing, the percentage of
intercourse attempts that were successful (assessed
according to sexual encounter profile question 3
[sep-q3]) was significantly greater in recipients of
a single dose of tadalafil 20mg (32%) than in placebo recipients (15%; p = 0.012) in a randomised,
double-blind study involving 223 men with mild-to© adis data information bv 2003. all rights reserved.

severe ed of ≥3 months’ duration conducted in the
home setting (data presented in an abstract).[15] the
men received a single dose of tadalafil or placebo
every 8 to 10 days (total of 4 doses) when ready to
engage in sexual activity. with tadalafil 20mg, the
mean time for achievement of an erection was 17
minutes in responders (patients able to have at least
one erection sufficient for successful sexual intercourse within 30 minutes of receiving the study
drug).
● similarly, the percentage of the 227 intercourse
attempts that were successful (assessed according to
sep-q3) at 24 hours after administration was greater with a single dose of tadalafil 20mg than with
placebo (53% vs 29%; both p < 0.001) in a randomised, double-blind study in 348 men with mild-tosevere ed.[13]
● in an integrated analysis of five randomised,
double-blind trials in men with ed (n = 1112) of 12
weeks’ duration, the percentage of successful intercourse attempts after a single dose of tadalafil 20mg
(measured by sep-q3) was 39% in the first 30
minutes, 73% for 30 minutes to 4 hours and 80%
from 4 hours to 24 hours.[14]
effects on cardiovascular parameters
● there were no significant between-group differences in the mean maximal changes from baseline in
standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (bp)
in 33 recipients of a single oral dose of tadalafil
20mg and 15 recipients of placebo (mean difference
–0.2/–4.6mm hg) in a randomised, double-blind
study in men with ed (data reported in an abstract
and poster).[16] although, the between-group difference in the mean maximal changes from baseline in
standing systolic bp in 32 recipients of a tadalafil
10mg and placebo was statistically significantly different (+1.3mm hg), the difference was not considered to be clinically relevant by the researchers.
there was no between-group difference in diastolic
bp (–2.6mm hg). there was no statistically signif-

icant difference in heart rate after treatment with
tadalafil (10 or 20mg) or placebo. see section 4 for
details of the cardiovascular adverse event profile in
tadalafil recipients.
in a pooled analysis of data from 1328 men with
mild to severe ed treated with tadalafil 2.5–20mg or
placebo in six phase iii trials,[16] there were no
statistically or clinically significant between-group
differences in the mean changes from baseline to
endpoint in systolic and diastolic bp and heart rate.
●

there was no significant-between group difference in the time to ischaemia during exercise stress
testing in men with stable coronary artery disease
treated with tadalafil 10mg or placebo approximately 2–2.5 hours previously (data reported in an abstract).[17] the randomised, double-blind, crossover
trial involved 23 men (aged 53–75 years) who demonstrated ischaemia during a screening exercise
stress test (≥5 metabolic equivalents). the time to
limiting ischaemia (≥1.5mm st depression in ≥2
contiguous leads, and/or until limited by symptoms
of cardiac ischaemia with ≥1.5mm st depression on
continuous ecg recording) after 13 minutes of exercise was 31 and 36 seconds in recipients of
tadalafil 10mg and placebo, respectively. changes
in bp and heart rate were similar in tadalafil and
placebo recipients.
●

co-administration of tadalafil 20mg and alcohol
(0.6 g/kg taken 2 hours after the tadalafil dose) had
no clinically significant effect on maximum standing or supine systolic/diastolic bp or heart rate in a
placebo-controlled crossover study in 48 healthy
male volunteers (aged 18–60 years).[18] the between-group difference in the least-squares mean
maximum decrease in standing systolic/diastolic bp
in tadalafil/alcohol and placebo/alcohol recipients
was 3.2/0.3mm hg. the between-group difference
in the least-squares mean maximum increase in
standing heart rate was 4.1 beats per minute.

interactions with nitrates

tadalafil had a minimal effect, relative to placebo, on the mean maximal change in standing systolic
bp (mmcsbp) induced by sublingual or long-acting nitroglycerin (the primary endpoint) in randomised, double-blind, crossover trials (data presented
in abstracts) in healthy volunteers[19] or in patients
with stable angina pectoris.[20] in a study in 49
healthy volunteers aged >55 years, there was no
significant difference in the mmcsbp induced by
sublingual nitroglycerin with tadalafil 10mg or placebo administration.[19] in patients with stable angina, the mmcsbp versus placebo after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin (n = 51) or daily
long-acting nitroglycerin (n = 45) was –3 and –2mm
hg with tadalafil 10mg and –8 (p < 0.05) and 0mm
hg with tadalafil 5mg.[20]
● however, tadalafil augmented the decrease in bp
induced by nitrates in a subset of patients with
angina[20] and healthy volunteers[19] (see figure 1 for
the number of men with standing systolic bp
<85mm hg [outliers] after administration of sublingual[19,20] or long-acting nitroglycerin[20]). there was
no significant between-group difference in the number of outliers following tadalafil 10mg or sildenafil
administration in the study in healthy volunteers.[19]
●

2. pharmacokinetic profile
● noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters
of a single dose of oral tadalafil 10 or 20mg were
determined in an integrated analysis (presented as an
abstract) of 13 studies involving a total of 237
healthy volunteers.[21] the dose-dependent parameters for the 10mg dose were normalised to 20mg.
tadalafil 20mg was rapidly absorbed following oral
administration with a mean maximum plasma concentration of 378 mug/l occurring at a median of 2
hours; the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) was 8066 mug • h/l.[22] the
mean apparent volume of distribution was 62.6l.

with standing systolic bp (sbp) <85mm hg after administration of
sublingual nitroglycerin or long-acting nitroglycerin in randomised,
double-blind, crossover studies.[19,20] tadalafil 5 or 10mg or placebo
was administered to 51 patients with stable angina 2 hours before
administration of sublingual nitroglycerin (study 1) or to 45 patients
with stable angina during daily long-acting nitroglycerin therapy
(study 2).[20] in study 3,[19] 49 healthy volunteers (aged >55 years)
were administered sublingual nitroglycerin following tadalafil 10mg,
sildenafil 50mg or placebo treatment.

the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) for tadalafil was
17.5 hours and the mean apparent oral clearance was
2.48 l/h.
tadalafil is primarily metabolised by the  xxxg590xxx . the primary metabolite is
methylcatechol glucuronide, which has ≥13 000fold less affinity for pde5 than tadalafil, and is
consequently not clinically active.[23]
●

neither age nor gender had a statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tadalafil
(dosage not clearly stated), according to data presented in a poster.[23] the tadalafil auc in healthy
volunteers aged >65 years (n = 12) was 25% greater
than that for volunteers aged 18–65 years (n = 12).
this was associated with a longer t1/2 in elderly than
young volunteers (21.6 vs 16.9 hours). however,
these differences were not statistically significant
and were not considered to be clinically significant
by the researchers.[23]
●

the tadalafil auc was reduced (19%) and the t1/2
was shorter in patients with diabetes mellitus (n =
13) than in those without diabetes mellitus (n = not
stated).[23] however, these differences were not statistically significant and were not considered to be
clinically significant.[23]
● mild (creatinine clearance 51–80 ml/min) or
moderate (creatinine clearance 31–50 ml/min) renal impairment or hepatic impairment (child-pugh
class a and b) did not alter the pharmacokinetic
parameters of tadalafil (statistical significance not
determined).[23]
● food did not alter the rate and extent of absorption of a single dose of tadalafil 20mg in healthy
volunteers (n = 18).[23]
●

3. therapeutic efficacy
the therapeutic efficacy of on-demand tadalafil
(taken as required, but no more than once daily) has
been investigated in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild-to-severe
ed.[14,24-26] although two early 3- (n = 179)[25] and
8-week (n = 212)[26] phase ii studies investigated the
efficacy of on-demand tadalafil 2–25mg in patients
with mild-to-severe ed, this section focuses on the
efficacy of tadalafil 10 and 20mg, as reported in the
phase iii trials.[14,24]
phase iii studies of 12 weeks’ duration have
investigated the efficacy of on-demand tadalafil in
men with a minimum 3-month history of ed associated with diabetes mellitus[24] or various etiologies.[14] one study investigated the effects of ondemand tadalafil 10 or 20mg in 216 men (mean age
56 years) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.[24]
in addition, a pooled analysis of five studies reported the effects of on-demand tadalafil 2.5–20mg in
1112 men with ed (mean age 59 years) of various
etiologies (organic [61%], psychogenic [9%] or
mixed [31%]).[14] the men were free to choose the
time of sexual activity attempts, and were able to

international index of erectile function

erectile function (assessed by the iief erectile
function domain score) was improved from baseline
to a significantly greater extent with tadalafil 10 or
20mg than placebo (p < 0.001; see figure 2) in men
with ed of various etiologies[14] and in men with ed
associated with diabetes mellitus.[24] lower doses of
tadalafil (2.5 and 5mg) were also significantly more
effective than placebo (p < 0.05; see figure 2) in men
with ed of various etiologies.[14] in patients with
diabetes mellitus,[24] this improvement was independent of baseline glycosylated haemoglobin (hba1c)
level.
●

the mean improvements in iief scores on a
question relating to penetration ability (q3) and a
question relating to maintenance ability (q4) were
significantly greater versus placebo in a 12-week
trial in men with ed and diabetes mellitus who
received on-demand tadalafil 10 and 20mg (p <
0.001).[24]
●

the number of patients who achieved normal
erectile function (iief erectile function domain
score ≥26) at endpoint was significantly greater with
tadalafil 10 or 20mg (40% and 59%) than with
placebo (11%; p < 0.001) in men with mild to severe
erectile dysfunction of various etiologies.[14]
●

● mean iief intercourse satisfaction domain
scores and overall satisfaction domain scores were
improved to a greater extent with on-demand
tadalafil 10 and 20mg, compared with placebo, in
men with ed of various etiologies (p < 0.001)[14]
and in men with ed associated with diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05).[24]

mean change in iief erectile function domain

take tadalafil without restrictions on food and alcohol intake.[14,24]
the efficacy of tadalafil was evaluated using the
international index of erectile function (iief) questionnaire, sep diary data and a global assessment
question ( xxxg923xxx ; “has the treatment you have been
taking improved your erections?”).[14,24]
the iief is a self-measured 15-item questionnaire[27] that assessed five domains of male sexual
function (erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction).[27] responses to the questions were scored
on a categoric scale (response options of 0 [did not
attempt intercourse] and 1 [almost never/never] to 5
[almost always/always]).[27]
primary efficacy was measured by the changes
from baseline in the erectile function domain of the
iief and changes from baseline in the proportion of
‘yes’ responses to question 2 (q2: “were you able to
insert your penis into your partner’s vagina?”) and
question 3 (q3: “did your erection last long enough
for you to have successful intercourse”) of the
sep.[14,24]
baseline values of the above efficacy assessments were collected during a 4-week treatmentfree run-in period.[14,24]

tadalafil significantly enhanced patients’ erections according to the  xxxg923xxx .[14,24] in a study involving men with ed of various etiologies,[14] the proportion of positive responses to the  xxxg923xxx  was 67%
and 81% in recipients of on-demand tadalafil 10 and
20mg administration versus 35% in placebo recipients (p < 0.001). lower doses of tadalafil (2.5 and
5mg) were also more effective than placebo (p <

tadalafil recipients. one tadalafil recipient (0.1%)
reported an episode of abnormal colour vision.[14]
tadalafil was associated with good long-term
tolerability, according to preliminary data (presented in an abstract) from an open-label, randomised
extension of five 12-week, double-blind, multicentre trials (n = 1173).[29] patients were initiated on
tadalafil 10mg once daily, but titration to 20mg once
daily was permissible. during the study, 870 patients received tadalafil ≥10mg once daily and 574
patients received tadalafil 20mg once daily for at
least one year. headache (15%) and dyspepsia
(11%) were the most commonly reported adverse
events. overall 5% of tadalafil recipients discontinued because of adverse events.

fig. 4. treatment-related adverse events reported in patients with
erectile dysfunction of various etiologies. patients (n = 1112) were
randomised to tadalafil 2.5–20mg (taken as needed, but not more
than once daily) or placebo in five 12-week double-blind, multicentre studies (data from a pooled analysis).[14]

a variety of stable cardiovascular conditions and
those on multiple antihypertensives,[30] the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in recipients
of tadalafil (n = 949) and placebo (n = 379) was low,
with no significant between-group differences (e.g.
flushing [4% and 2%], dizziness [both 2%], hypertension [1% and 2%] and syncope [0.1% and
0.5%]). across all clinical trials, the incidence of
myocardial infarction was 0.39 and 1.1 per 100
patient-years in tadalafil recipients (n >4000) and
placebo recipients (n >1200), respectively.[30]
● the proportion of men showing a ≥50% decrease
in sperm concentration was similar in healthy men
with ed (n = 421) treated with once-daily tadalafil
10 or 20mg or placebo, according to data from two
separate 6-month randomised, studies (presented in
one abstract).[31] tadalafil 10 or 20mg once daily
had no adverse effects on sperm count per ejaculate,
percentage normal sperm motility or morphology or
serum levels of reproductive hormones. the men
were aged ≥45 years and met who reference values
for semen characteristics (sperm concentration ≥20
× 106/ml, >50% motility, >50% normal morphology).
5. dosage and administration
the recommended dose for tadalafil is 10mg
prior to sexual activity and without regard to food.
in men for whom the 10mg dose does not produce
an adequate effect, a 20mg dose may be taken.[12]
tadalafil can be taken from 30 minutes to 12 hours
prior to sexual activity, but sexual activity is required for the drug to take effect. the recommended
dose of tadalafil in men with impaired renal or
hepatic function is 10mg once daily. the efficacy of
tadalafil may persist for up to 24 hours post dose
(european labelling information).[12]
tadalafil should not be taken in combination
with any form of organic nitrate. tadalafil should
not be administered to patients with serious heart
disease, myocardial infarction within the last 90

6. tadalafil: current status
tadalafil has been approved for marketing in
europe and in australasia, and has received an
approvable letter from the us fda. it has shown
clinical efficacy in patients with mild-to-severe
ed,[14,24-26] including those with diabetes mellitus,[24] enabling men to have successful sexual
intercourse. tadalafil was well tolerated and adverse
events were generally of mild-to-moderate intensity.
