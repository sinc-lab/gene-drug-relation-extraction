abstract: serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx ), a pyridoxal 5â€²-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme
catalyzes the reversible conversion of  xxxd3193xxx  and  xxxd3334xxx  ( xxxd3334xxx ) to gly and 5,10methylene  xxxd3334xxx  (ch2- xxxd3334xxx ). biochemical and structural studies on this enzyme
have implicated several residues in the catalytic mechanism, one of them being the active site lysine,
which anchors plp. it has been proposed that this residue is crucial for product expulsion. however, in
other plp-dependent enzymes, the corresponding residue has been implicated in the proton abstraction
step of catalysis. in the present investigation, lys-226 of bacillus stearothermophilus  xxxg2069xxx  (bsshmt)
was mutated to met and gln to evaluate the role of this residue in catalysis. the mutant enzymes contained
1 mol of plp per mol of subunit suggesting that schiff base formation with lysine is not essential for
plp binding. the 3d structure of the mutant enzymes revealed that plp was bound at the active site in
an orientation different from that of the wild-type enzyme. in the presence of substrate, the plp ring was
in an orientation superimposable with that of the external aldimine complex of wild-type enzyme. however,
the mutant enzymes were inactive, and the kinetic analysis of the different steps of catalysis revealed that
there was a drastic reduction in the rate of formation of the quinonoid intermediate. analysis of these
results along with the crystal structures suggested that k-226 is responsible for flipping of plp from one
orientation to another which is crucial for  xxxd3334xxx -dependent cr-cbeta bond cleavage of  xxxd3193xxx .

serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx )1, a pyridoxal 5â€²phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme belongs to the r-family
(1) of plp enzymes and catalyzes the reversible reaction of
 xxxd3193xxx  and  xxxd3334xxx  ( xxxd3334xxx ) to yield gly
and 5,10-methylene  xxxd3334xxx  (ch2- xxxd3334xxx ).  xxxg2069xxx  is a key enzyme for the interconversion of
the folate coenzymes and for the biosynthesis of purine,

thymidine, and methionine. it is, therefore, postulated to be
a target for cancer chemotherapy (2, 3). the enzyme has
been studied from several pro- and eukaryotic sources, and
the properties have been reviewed (4-6).
biochemical and structural studies on  xxxg2069xxx  from various
sources (4-12) have implicated several amino acid residues
such as k-226, e-53, r-357, and h-122 in the catalytic
mechanism of the enzyme (numbering according to the
structure of bacillus stearothermophlus serine hydroxymethyltransfarase (bsshmt)) (7). the residues e-53 and
h-122 have been implicated to participate in proton abstraction (7). however, mutational analysis of h-147 (corresponding to h-122) in sheep liver cytosolic  xxxg2069xxx  (scshmt) resulted only in a partial loss of activity, suggesting
that this residue was probably not involved in the proton
abstraction step of catalysis (10). the three-dimensional
structure of the binary and ternary complexes of the bsshmt
(7) revealed that r-357 could interact with the  xxxd2154xxx 
of  xxxd3193xxx  and e-53 was close to the hydroxymethyl group of
 xxxd3193xxx . site-directed mutagenesis of r-363 in escherichia coli
(eshmt) and r-401 in scshmt (11, 12) (corresponding to
r-357 in bsshmt) resulted in a complete loss of activity,
confirming the role of this residue in substrate binding. on
the basis of an analysis of these results, retroaldol cleavage
and direct displacement mechanisms were proposed for the
reaction catalyzed by  xxxg2069xxx  (3, 7). recent observations of

scheme 1: reaction mechanism of bsshmt with serine and glycinea

a
bsshmt was isolated as an internal aldimine with plp linked to the -nh2 group of k226 (structure i). the internal aldimine had an absorbance
maximum at 425 nm. the internal aldimine upon reaction with  xxxd3193xxx  is converted to geminal diamine (structure ii) absorbing at 343 nm. this
conversion is accompanied by a change in the orientation of plp by 16Â° from that in the internal aldimine form. the geminal diamine is then
converted to external aldimine (structure iii) where the bond with k-226 is broken. the orientation of plp is changed by 25Â° from the initial
orientation (in the internal aldimine, structure i) and by 9Â° from the geminal diamine (structure ii). the attack of n5 of  xxxd3334xxx  on cbeta of  xxxd3193xxx 
leads to bond cleavage resulting in the formation of quinonoid intermediate (structure iv), and the products 5,10-ch2- xxxd3334xxx  and water are
released. the orientation of the plp ring returns back to that seen in the geminal diamine (16Â°) form, and the lysine residue is in close proximity
to the product amino acid. the quinonoid intermediate is converted to the glycine external aldimine (structure v); the orientation of plp in this
intermediate is 25Â° from the initial point, which in turn is converted to the geminal diamine (with the change in orientation of plp by 9Â°). the
geminal diamine (structure vi) is converted to internal aldimine with the orientation of plp returning to its initial position (structure i) upon
interaction with k-226. the geminal diamine is converted to the internal aldimine (structure i) by the release of glycine. the internal aldimine is
ready to catalyze the next cycle of reaction.

szebenyi et al. (9) suggested that a combination of direct
displacement and retroaldol cleavage could be a more
probable mechanism (9).
the first step of the reaction (scheme 1) involves
conversion of the internal aldimine (structure i) upon addition
of  xxxd3193xxx  to external aldimine (structure iii) (via geminal
diamine, structure ii). the external aldimine is subsequently
converted to a quinonoid intermediate as a result of a direct
attack of n5 of  xxxd3334xxx  on cbeta of serine, resulting in crcbeta bond cleavage accompanied by release of a water
molecule to form the product (glycine quinonoid intermediate);  xxxd3334xxx  is converted to ch2- xxxd3334xxx  (7). in the
geminal diamine complex (structure ii), the orientation of
plp is changed by 16Â° from that in the internal aldimine
(structure i). upon conversion to external aldimine (structure
iii) there is a further change in the orientation of 9Â°
corresponding to a total change of 25Â° from that in the
internal aldimine. the product quinonoid intermediate (in
which the plp is in an orientation similar to that of geminal
diamine complex) is converted to gly external aldimine, then
to geminal aldimine, and finally, upon release of product
gly, the -cho group of plp interacts with the -nh2 group
of lysine to form the internal aldimine, and the plp ring
returns to its original orientation. it is observed that addition
of  xxxd3334xxx  results in the enhancement of proton abstraction
from the cr carbon and formation of quinonoid intermediate
in the reverse reaction, that is, with glycine as substrate
(scheme 1).

mutational analysis of the lysine residue, which anchors
plp, has been carried out in several plp enzymes (1321). the studies with aspartate aminotransferase (aat)
revealed that the mutant enzymes were either completely
inactive or showed very low levels of activity depending on
the nature of the substitutions of lysine. mutation to ala,
arg, or cys resulted in an inactive enzyme (13, 16, 17), the
his mutant had 0.1% activity compared to the wild-type
enzyme (16). these observations were interpreted to suggest
that the active site lysine amino group was serving as the
base to remove the r-proton of the substrate in forming the
quinonoid intermediate. this conclusion was also supported
by the three-dimensional structure of the mutant enzymes
(19).
on the other hand, escherichia coli  xxxg2069xxx  (eshmt)
k229h and k229r mutants were inactive, whereas the
k229q mutant was isolated with bound substrate and
catalyzed a single turnover reaction (20). these results
suggested that the lys-229 was involved in the product
expulsion step of catalysis. however, in the absence of crystal
structure of these mutants and their substrate complexes, it
is not possible to satisfactorily delineate the role of active
site lysine residue in catalysis. the present paper describes
the biochemical characterization of k226m and k226q
mutants of bsshmt along with the three-dimensional
structures in the unliganded and substrate-bound forms. an
analysis of the results clearly suggested that lysine-226 plays
a crucial role in  xxxd3334xxx -dependent cr-cbeta bond cleavage

role of k226 in bsshmt catalysis
of serine and abstraction of cr proton from glycine. the
interaction of -nh2 of k-226 with c4 of plp is central for
the flipping of plp from one orientation to another among
different enzyme intermediates, which is a crucial requirement in catalysis.
materials and methods
materials. l-[3-14c]-serine, restriction endonucleases, and
dna-modifying enzymes were obtained from amersham
pharmacia biotech ltd., buckinghamshire, england. deep
vent polymerase was purchased from new england biolabs,
beverly, mo. taq dna polymerase was purchased from
bangalore genei pvt. ltd., bangalore. deae-cellulose, gly,
 xxxd3193xxx , d-ala, 2- xxxd26xxx  (2 -me),  xxxd2146xxx , plp,
methoxyamine (ma), iptg, and edta were obtained from
sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo. platinum oxide was
purchased from loba chemie, mumbai. all other chemicals
used were of analytical reagent grade.
bacterial strains and growth conditions. e. coli strain
dh5r (brl) was the recipient for all the plasmids used in
subcloning. the bl21 (de3) plyss strain (22) was used
for bacterial expression of prsh (b. stearothermophilus
 xxxg2069xxx  gene cloned and overexpressed in prset c vector)
(23), and mutant constructs were similarly overexpressed.
luria-bertani (lb) medium or terrific broth with 50 Âµg/
ml of ampicillin was used for growing e. coli cells
containing the plasmids (24).
dna manipulations. plasmids were prepared by the
alkaline lysis procedure (24). preparation of competent cells
and transformation were carried out by the method of
alexander (25). the dna fragments were eluted with qia
quick gel extraction.
site-directed mutagenesis. k226q and k226m mutants
of bsshmt were constructed using the following primers:
for k226q, (sense primer) 5â€²gacgacgcatacaacg
ttgcgc 3â€² and (antisense primer) 5â€² gcacaacgtttgatgcgtcgtc 3â€²; for k226m, (sense primer) 5â€² gacgacgcatatgacgttgcgc 3â€² and (antisense primer) 5â€² gcgcaacgtcatatgcgtcgt 3â€². the nucleotides in italics
indicate the mutations introduced. primers were used on
prsh template to construct mutants by a pcr-based senseantisense primer method (23). dna sequencing, using abi
prism automated dna sequencer, confirmed the presence
of mutation and that no other mutations were present.
expression and purification of bsshmt and mutant
enzymes. the expression and purification of wild-type
(bsshmt) and the mutant enzymes were carried out essentially according to jala et al. (23). briefly, prsh, k226m,
and k226q constructs were transformed into e. coli bl21
(de3) plyss strain. a single colony was grown in 50 ml
of lb medium containing 50 Âµg/ml ampicillin at 30 Â°c.
these cells were inoculated into 1 l of terrific broth medium
containing 50 Âµg/ml ampicillin. after 3-4 h at 30 Â°c, cells
were induced with 0.3 mm iptg for 4-5 h. the cells were
then harvested, re-suspended in 60 ml of buffer a (50 mm
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, containing  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm
edta, and 100 Âµm plp), and sonicated. the supernatant
was subjected to 0-65% ammonium sulfate precipitation;
the pellet obtained was re-suspended in 20-30 ml of buffer
b (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0, containing
1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta, and 50 Âµm plp) and dialyzed

biochemistry, vol. 44, no. 18, 2005 6931
for 24 h against the same buffer (1 l with two changes).
the dialyzed sample was loaded onto deae-cellulose,
which was previously equilibrated with buffer b. the column
was washed with 500 ml of buffer b, and the bound protein
was eluted with 50 ml of buffer c (200 mm potassium
phosphate buffer, ph 6.4, containing 1 mm edta, 1 mm
 xxxd26xxx , and 50 Âµm plp). the eluted protein was precipitated
at 65% ammonium sulfate saturation, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer d (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer,
ph 7.4, containing 1 mm edta and 1 mm  xxxd26xxx ) and
dialyzed against the same buffer (2 l, with two changes)
for 24 h. protein was estimated using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as a standard (26).
enzyme assays. hydroxymethyltransferase reaction.  xxxd3334xxx -dependent cleavage of  xxxd3193xxx  to form gly and 5,10ch2- xxxd3334xxx  was monitored using l-[3-14c]-ser and
 xxxd3334xxx  as substrates (27). one unit of enzyme activity
was defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzes the
formation of 1 Âµmol of formaldehyde/min at 37 Â°c. specific
activity was expressed as units per milligram of protein.
transaminase activity.  xxxd3334xxx -independent transamination of d-ala yields pyruvate, and bound plp is converted
to pyridoxamine-5â€²-phosphate (pmp) (28). the spectra of
bsshmt, k226m, k226qbsshmt (25 Âµm) in buffer d
were recorded in a shimadzuuv-160a spectrophotometer.
absorbance changes occurring at 425 nm upon addition of
100 mm d-ala at 37 Â°c were recorded. the pseudo-firstorder rate constants were calculated from these data. the
reaction with d-ala was used to prepare the wild-type and
mutant apoenzymes. the enzyme concentration is always
expressed in terms of subunit molecular weight.
stopped-flow spectrophotometry. the pre-steady-state
kinetics of the wild-type and the mutant bsshmt with gly
or gly +  xxxd3334xxx  or methoxyamine (ma) were monitored,
using sx.18mv-r stopped-flow spectrophotometer with a
path length of 2 mm and pressure of 125 psi (8 bar),
compressed nitrogen. the dead time of the instrument was
1 ms.
all experiments were performed in 50 mm potassiumphosphate buffer, (ph 7.4) containing 1 mm edta and 1
mm  xxxd26xxx . single wavelength stopped-flow kinetic measurements were performed at 25 Â°c with temperature controlled
by a circulating water bath. the mixer was set up with two
syringes containing the enzyme (500 Âµm) and gly (100 mm),
or gly +  xxxd3334xxx  (70 Âµm) or ma (4 mm, 40 mm). the
contents were mixed, and the reaction was initiated. single
wavelength data were collected at different time regimes.
for each data set, 1000 data points were collected. all
experiments were repeated at least three times for each of
the time regimes. the data were analyzed using sx.18mv-r
v4.42 software program (29, 30).
crystallization. crystals of k226m and k226q mutants
were grown under the same conditions as described for the
wild-type enzyme (7). in brief, crystals were obtained by
mixing 4 Âµl of protein solution (375 Âµm) with 4 Âµl of
reservoir solution containing 100 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.5,
0.2 mm edta, 5 mm  xxxd26xxx , and 50% 2-methyl-2,4pentanediol (mpd). crystals of complex of k226m with
serine were grown under the same condition, except that the
reservoir solution contained in addition 20 mm  xxxd3193xxx .
crystals of k226q complex with gly were obtained under

contained in addition 20 mm gly and 100 Âµm plp.
x-ray diffraction data collection and processing. for data
collection, crystals were soaked for a few seconds in a
harvesting solution containing 100 mm hepes buffer, ph
7.5, 0.2 mm edta, 5 mm  xxxd26xxx , 30% mpd, and 25%
glycerol and flash frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 k. x-ray
diffraction data were collected on a rotating anode x-ray
generator using an image plate detector. the hkl program
suite was used for data reduction and scaling (31). crystals
of both the mutants and their complexes belonged to p21212
space group with one monomer in the asymmetric unit.
details of cell dimensions and data collection statistics for
these crystals are shown in table 1.
structure determination and model building. the bsshmt (pdb code 1kkj) crystal structure refined previously
at 1.93 Ã¥ (7) was used as an initial model for the structure
determination of k226m mutant crystals. the model was
subjected to rigid body refinement using the program xplor
(32). the n- and c-terminal domains (residues 5-280 and
281-403) of the model were refined independently. phases
from this refined model were used to calculate 2fo - fc
and fo - fc maps and visualized using the graphics program
turbo-frodo (33). the map was readily interpretable, and
the electron density for the plp cofactor, which was omitted
from the model, was clearly visible. the model was further
refined using maximum likelihood positional refinement in
refmac, with restrained temperature factors. a manual model
building was carried out using the program turbo-frodo (34).
solvent molecules were added during final cycles of refinement. the crystallographic free r-factor (35) was monitored
at each stage to prevent model bias. statistics of the final
model are presented in table 1.
the electron density maps for the k226m-  xxxd3193xxx  and
k226q-gly complex crystals were computed using the
structure of k226m protein as a model without plp and
solvent molecules. the models for the  xxxd3193xxx - and gly-bound
mutant forms were subsequently refined in the same manner
as the k226m mutant structure. comparisons of the wildtype structures and mutant structures were carried out by
manual superposition followed by rigid body refinement
option in turbo-frodo, as well as using the ccp4 program
lsqkab. differences between the structures were detected
visually and by calculating the distances between corre-

results and disscussion
structure of lysine mutants of bsshmt. the overall
structures of the lysine mutants are very similar to that of
the wild-type enzyme (figure 1). k226m and k226qbsshmt
show a rms deviation of 0.14 Ã¥ and 0.15 Ã¥, respectively,
when compared with the wild-type enzyme. the mutation
did not induce any gross conformational changes in the
protein molecule. active sites of both of the mutants are
essentially similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. however,
an interesting positional change was observed in the orientation of the plp ring in the mutant protein structure compared
to wild-type bsshmt (figure 2). the plp ring in the mutant
protein structure showed a rotation of approximately 16Â°
around the c5-c5â€² bond of plp (figure 2), compared to
the bsshmt internal aldimine (7). the crystal structure of
the ternary complex of murine cytosolic  xxxg2069xxx  and bsshmt
showed a rotation of 16Â° of the plp ring compared to the
orientation of plp in the internal aldimine (7, 36). the
orientation of plp in these structures is ascribed to the
position of plp in the geminal diamine form. similarly,
structures of lysine mutants of aat revealed a rotation of
the plp ring of 16Â° compared to the wild-type enzyme (19).
the plp ring in the structure of mutant protein with the
substrate undergoes a further rotation of approximately 9Â°
compared to the unliganded k226m and k226qbsshmt
structures. the conformation of the plp ring in the structure
of unliganded mutant shmts appears to be that of geminal
diamine form, whereas the orientation of the plp in the
substrate-bound form of the mutant shmts appears to be
in the external aldimine conformation, with a rotation of
approximately 25Â° compared to the wild-type enzyme. the
structures of the mutant enzymes clearly demonstrate that

the plp could bind even in the absence of a covalent bond
with lysine (figure 2). however, the orientation of the plp
ring seems to be affected by the disruption of the schiff base.
on the basis of the spectral and kinetic studies of the lysine
mutant of eshmt (ek229q), it has been reported that the
enzyme was isolated with bound substrate (20). however,
the lysine mutant structures of bsshmt (figure 2) clearly
demonstrate that there was no density attributable to the
bound substrate. the crystals of complexes of k226m and
k226qbsshmt with ser/gly were obtained by crystallization in the presence of 10 mm ser/gly in the drop (for details
see materials and methods). the complexes (ser/gly) of the
k226m and k226q revealed the presence of the bound
substrate in the active site of the enzyme. (figure 3). the
orientation of the plp ring and the conformation of the
substrate in the active site are very similar to that of external
aldimine form of the wild-type enzyme. thus, the formation
of the external aldimine (ser/gly) from the plp of the
enzyme, which is in an orientation similar to that seen in
geminal diamine complexes, seems to be unaffected by this
mutation.
plp content and catalytic activity of wild-type and
lysine mutants. the plp content of k226mbsshmt was
1 mol of plp/mol of subunit, similar to that of the wildtype enzyme (table 2), whereas k226qbsshmt, as isolated,
contained 0.5 mol of plp/mol of subunit. addition of 100
Âµm of plp to this enzyme preparation, followed by
incubation for 45 min at 4 Â°c and dialysis for 24 h against
buffer not containing plp, restored the plp content to 1
mol of plp/mol of subunit (table 2). these observations
suggest that plp may not be as tightly bound in
k226qbsshmt compared to k226mbsshmt (table 2).

this preparation of k226qbsshmt containing 1 mol of
plp/mol of subunit was used throughout the studies. it is
interesting to recall the observations with eshmt lysine
mutants, which are also dimers. k229qeshmt was isolated
with full complement of plp but bound to the substrate, and
k229heshmt did not contain plp as external aldimine.
in contrast, the mutation of lys-256 in scshmt resulted in
the disruption of the tetrameric structure and loss of plp
(21). the specific activity of bsshmt was 5.2 u/mg,
whereas k226m and k226qbsshmt, as isolated, had
specific activities of 0.023 u/mg, and 0.021 u/mg, respectively, in the  xxxd3334xxx -dependent reaction with  xxxd3193xxx . (table
2). the wild-type and mutant enzyme preparations were
treated with 0.4 mm nacnbh3, incubated for 30 min at 37
Â°c, and dialyzed overnight against 2 l of buffer d. this
treatment reduces the internal aldimine to a secondary amine,
whereas the external aldimine is not affected (20). bsshmt
lost all its activity, and the mutant enzymes also lost the
residual activity, resulting in an enzyme preparation that was
devoid of activity. when activity was assayed using a 10 000fold excess of the mutant enzyme protein compared to wildtype enzyme, an insignificant amount of activity was found.
hence, the kinetic parameters such as km and kcat of the
mutant enzymes were not determined. these results suggest
that mutation of lys has resulted in a complete loss of
activity. in the case of k229qeshmt, the enzyme catalyzed
a single turnover reaction but did not show steady-state
catalytic activity. after a detailed examination, it was
suggested that the lys mutations in eshmt had probably

syringe a contained a mixture of bsshmt (500 Âµm) + gly (100
mm) incubated for 10 min at 18 Â°c and flowed against 70 Âµm of
 xxxd3334xxx  in syringe b. the relative absorbance at 495 nm was
monitored in a stopped flow apparatus as described in materials
and methods. a rapid increase in absorbance at 495 nm was
monitored with bsshmt. whereas no change was observed with
k226mbsshmt, when a similar experiment was performed with
k226qbsshmt, no absorbance change was observed at 495 nm
when the glycine complex was rapidly mixed with  xxxd3334xxx .

spectra were recorded in shimadzu uv-160 spectrophotometer at

subunit. (a) the spectrum of bsshmt (25 Âµm) gave an absorbance
maximum at 425 nm characteristic for plp internal aldimine (curve
e). addition of gly (50 mm) gave a spectrum with a small peak
at 495 nm, suggesting the formation of quinonoid intermediate
(curve e + gly). further addition of  xxxd3334xxx  (1.8 mm) enhanced
the concentration of the quinonoid intermediate (curve gly +  xxxd3334xxx ). (b) k226mbsshmt (50 Âµm) gave a spectrum with an
absorbance maximum at 412 nm (curve e); when gly (50 mm)
was added to the enzyme, the absorbance maximum shifted to 425
nm (curve e + gly); when  xxxd3334xxx  (when added to e + gly)
was added, a minor increase in absorbance at 495 nm was observed
(curve gly +  xxxd3334xxx ). (c) inset, similar experiments were carried
out with k226mbsshmt (50 Âµm). e represents k226qbsshmt,

affected the product release step of catalysis (20). our results
are in disagreement with this explanation as no detectable
activity was observed with k226m and k226qbsshmt
(table 2).
spectral properties and kinetic studies. k226mbsshmt
had an absorbance maximum at 412 nm compared to the
absorbance maximum at 425 nm of the internal aldimine of
bsshmt (figure 4). the 412 nm absorbance maximum for
the k226mbsshmt mutant could be due to the aldehyde
from the plp. the bathachromic shift from 390 to 412 nm
could be due to altered interactions of the enzyme with plp,
especially in the absence of lysine residue. these altered
interactions could be responsible for the change in the
orientation of the plp ring by 16Â° observed in the crystal
structure of the mutant enzyme (figure 2) compared to the
internal aldimine structure of bsshmt. it is interesting to
recall that the active site lysine mutants of aat also revealed
a similar change in the orientation of the plp ring (19).
addition of gly to k226m and k226qbsshmt resulted in
a shift in the absorbance maximum from 412 to 425 nm,
suggesting that plp at the active site has the ability to react
with the substrate and form an external aldimine complex
(figure 4). the orientations of the plp ring and the amino

acid substrate in the crystal structure of the external aldimine
forms of k226m and k226q were very similar to their
corresponding orientation in the external aldimine form of
the wild-type enzyme (figure 3).
in the reverse reaction with gly, the conversion of gly
external aldimine to quinonoid intermediate occurs by the
abstraction of a cr proton (scheme 1). addition of gly to
wild-type bsshmt resulted in a small increase in absorbance
at 495 nm, indicating the formation of quinonoid intermediate
(figure 4), which was not seen in the mutants. the rate
constant for the formation of the quinonoid intermediate with
wild-type enzyme was 0.06 s-1; however, this rate was not
measurable for either of the mutants. addition of  xxxd3334xxx 
to mutants resulted in the appearance of a very small peak
(0.0567 au) at 495 nm, with a negligible rate constant.
however, in the wild-type enzyme, addition of  xxxd3334xxx 
resulted in a large increase in the absorbance at 495 nm
(0.234 au) (figure 5) with a rate constant of 340 s-1
(measured using the stopped-flow apparatus as described in
materials and methods). a similar increase in absorbance
at 495 nm, upon addition of  xxxd3334xxx , was observed in all
shmts (4, 5). the absence of a considerable increase in
absorbance at 495 nm, upon addition of gly and  xxxd3334xxx ,
suggested that the  xxxd3334xxx -mediated proton abstraction was
affected by mutation of k226 to met or gln.
5-cho- xxxd3334xxx , an analogue of  xxxd3334xxx , reacts with
the quinonoid intermediate generated during the  xxxg2069xxx 
reaction with gly (37). it can be seen from figure 7 that the
wild-type enzyme, upon interaction with glycine and 5-choh4pteglu, yielded the characteristic quinonoid intermediate
with a maximum absorbance at 495 nm, with a rate constant
of 0.08 s-1. the mutant enzyme did not show any absorbance
change at 495 nm (figure 6). these observations suggest
that the quinonoid intermediate was not formed in the mutant
with the substrates. it is possible that the conversion from
structure v to structure iv (scheme 1) does not occur in the
mutant enzyme.
hydroxylamine and its derivatives such as methoxyamine
and  xxxd439xxx  have been used to monitor the
reactivity of the internal aldimine of scshmt (12). earlier

figure 6: interaction of 5-cho- xxxd3334xxx  with bsshmt and
k226mbsshmt. (a) bsshmt (25 Âµm) was taken in buffer d, and
the was spectrum recorded (curve e). to this solution, glycine (50
mm) was added and the spectrum recorded (curve e + gly).
5-cho- xxxd3334xxx  (70 Âµm) was added to the enzyme-gly mixture, and the spectra was recorded (gly + 5-cho- xxxd3334xxx ), and
the characteristic quinonid intermediate of the enzyme ternary
complex was seen. (b) the spectrum of k226mbsshmt (50 Âµm)
was recorded as described above (curve e). addition of glycine
(50 mm) shifted the absorbance maximum from 412 to 425 nm.
when 5-cho- xxxd3334xxx  (70 Âµm) was added to the enzymeglycine mixture, there was a hump at 495 nm (curve gly +
5-cho- xxxd3334xxx .

observation on  xxxg2069xxx  showed that methoxyamine reacts with
the internal aldimine to generate a characteristic intermediate
absorbing at 388 nm before the formation of the oxime
product. (30) the interaction of methoxyamine with bsshmt
resulted in the disappearance of internal aldimine and gly
external aldimine at 425 nm and the formation of an
intermediate with maximum absorbance at 388 nm (figure
7). the rate of this reaction was monitored using stoppedflow kinetics. the rate constant was 1.6 s-1 for the disruption
of the internal aldimine (as monitored by decrease in optical
density at 425 nm) as well as for the formation of the
intermediate (lambdamax at 388 nm). the intermediate was converted to the oxime product with the absorbance maximum
at 325 nm and a rate constant of 0.004 s-1 (figure 6). neither
of the lysine mutants and their gly external aldimine
complexes showed any change in absorbance at 412, 388,
and 325 nm indicating that plp at the active site of the
mutant was incapable of interacting with ma.
 xxxd3334xxx -independent reaction. in addition to the physiological reaction,  xxxg2069xxx  catalyzes the  xxxd3334xxx -independent
transamination of d-ala to yield pmp and pyruvate as
products. (28) the pseudo-first-order rate constants for
transamination with d-ala by k226m and k226qbsshmt
were 0.021 and 0.015 s-1, respectively, compared to 0.04
s-1 for the wild-type enzyme (table 2). this result suggests
that mutation has not drastically affected the h4ptegluindependent activity. on the other hand, the h4ptegludependent physiological reaction is curtailed (figure 4). it
is interesting to recall that in the case of eshmt, the  xxxd3334xxx -independent activity of ek229r and ek229h was

min, 10 min, and 15 min. the figure shows the formation of an
intermediate with absorbance maximum at 388 nm prior to
formation of the product oxime absorbing at 325 nm. (b) the
spectral changes observed in figure 5a were not apparent when

negligible (20), whereas k229qeshmt showed considerable
activity, similar to the observation with k226mbsshmt
(table 2) (20). transamination reaction has been extensively
used to study the reversible binding of plp at the active
site. while plp, in wild-type enzyme, could be removed in
1 h upon reaction with d-ala, in the case of mutant bsshmt,
overnight (12 h) incubation was required to remove bound
plp. addition of plp to the apoenzymes resulted in regain
of absorbance at 412 nm for the mutant enzyme and at 425
nm for apo-bsshmt. addition of substrate to the reconstituted apoenzyme of the mutant resulted in a shift in the
absorbance maximum from 412 to 425 nm indicating the
formation of external aldimine (data not presented). these
results suggest that the mutation of the lysine residue has
not affected the reversible binding of plp to the enzyme,
although the internal aldimine is not formed and the
conversion of bound plp to the external aldimine takes place
readily upon the addition of ser/gly to k226m or
k226qbsshmt.
from the results presented in this paper, it is clear that,
although the mutation of k226 does not affect the h4ptegluindependent reaction, it results in an almost complete loss
of  xxxd3334xxx -dependent physiological reaction. this loss may
not be due to the inability of the mutant to bind to  xxxd3334xxx .
we were able to successfully model 5-cho- xxxd3334xxx  into
the structure of k226m and k226qbsshmt substrate binary
complexes, and  xxxd3334xxx  binding pocket is unaffected. the
fit was identical to that seen in the ternary complex of
bsshmt (data not shown).
this paper describes for the first time the crystal structure
of lysine mutants of  xxxg2069xxx  and their substrate complexes.
in view of the lack of even a single turnover (table 1) and

6936 biochemistry, vol. 44, no. 18, 2005
absence of bound h2o at the active site (figures 1, 2a, and
3), it can be suggested that k-226 plays a crucial role in an
earlier step of catalysis (conversion of structure iii to
structure iv and structure v to structure iv). in order for
the product to be formed, cr-cbeta bond cleavage should be
concurrent with the conversion of the enzyme from the
external aldimine form of the substrate to the geminal
aldimine form of the product (structure vi) prior to the
release of the product and the formation of the internal
aldimine (structure i). the orientation of plp changes from
25Â° in the external aldimine form to 16Â° in the quinonoid
intermediate, and the quinonoid intermediate is stabilized by
the interactions of lysine at the active site (36). it is clear
that the mutation does not affect either binding of plp or
its conversion to the substrate external aldimine complex
(table 2 and figures 2, 3, and 4). however, the conversion
of the external aldimine (plp -25Â°) structure iii to the
quinonoid intermediate is affected (figures 4 and 5). the
quinonoid intermediate with the product gly appears to be
in the geminal diamine form (36). in the structure of the
ternary complex of the mcshmt as well bsshmt (which
are in quinonoid intermediate form), the plp orientation is
like that seen in geminal diamine complex.
in the absence of the -nh2 group of lysine, the conversion
of the external aldimine to product quinonoid intermediate,
where the plp orientation is similar to that of geminal
diamine, that is, the change in orientation of plp from 25Â°
to 16Â°, may not be possible. this inturn could lead to shifting
of equilibrium toward the substrate external aldimine form
(serine form). further, the interactions of k226 with residues
such as tyr-51 and thr-223 have been implicated in the
conversion of the enzyme from one form to another. (7, 38).
these interactions do not exist in k226mbsshmt (figures
2 and 3), and therefore, the conversion of substrate external
aldimine to quinonoid intermediate (which is in an orientation
similar to that of geminal diamine) is not possible. thus
k-226 is responsible for flipping of plp from one orientation
to another, which is accompanied by cr-cbeta bond cleavage,
and for the  xxxd3334xxx -mediated enhanced cr proton abstraction in the reverse reaction.
