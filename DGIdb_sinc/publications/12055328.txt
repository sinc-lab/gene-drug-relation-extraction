out affecting the expression of ppar␥2. the other tested
 xxxd2154xxx  ( xxxd2490xxx , docosahexaenoic acid and ␻-6
pufas) had no effect. the effect of epa was dependent on
the concentration (maximal effect after 6 hours with 50 ␮m)
and was not reproduced by activators of the different members of the ppar family. in addition, a strong positive
correlation was found between plasma epa concentrations and
ppar␥ mrna levels in adipose tissue of obese subjects.
discussion: our results demonstrate that adipose tissue
ppar␥1 mrna concentration is positively regulated by
epa, suggesting that the composition of dietary lipids may
affect ppar␥ gene expression in vivo in humans. these
data also suggest that an induction of the expression of this
nuclear receptor isoform might be involved in the mechanism of action of epa and in some of its beneficial effects.

introduction

the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ␥
(ppar␥) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily
that heterodimerize with the 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  receptor
(rxr) and bind to specific response elements in the promoter regions of target genes to change their transcription
rate (1,2). ppar␥1 and -␥2 are generated from the same
gene by alternative promoter usage and mrna splicing (3).
they differ in their 28 amino terminus amino acids in
humans, but possess the same ligand-binding domain (3).
ppar␥1 is mainly expressed in adipocytes, but also in
several cell types and tissues, like in colon (4,5), in epithelial cells of the intestinal tract (5,6), in kidney (4), in
macrophages (7), and also, at low concentrations, in skeletal
muscle (4,8). in contrast to ppar␥1, the expression of
ppar␥2 mrna is mainly restricted to adipocytes (4).

effect of  xxxd2318xxx  in adipocytes, chambrier et al.

the ppar␥ proteins are major regulators of adipocyte
differentiation (9,10). they are also regarded as important
factors involved in the control of whole-body insulin sensitivity (11). in addition, the expression of ppar␥1 in
macrophages and in tumor cells has recently focused the
attention on additional possible functions in atherosclerosis,
inflammation, and cancer (12–14).
until now, however, little has been known regarding the
regulation of ppar␥ gene expression in human tissues.
ppar␥ mrna concentrations are reduced in subcutaneous
adipose tissue of obese subjects after calorie restriction
(15,16), whereas insulin increases adipose-tissue ppar␥
expression both in vivo (17) and in vitro (15,17). these
results suggest thus that ppar␥ gene expression could be
controlled, at least in part, by nutritional regulation. in
agreement, fasting and refeeding have been shown to affect
adipose tissue ppar␥ gene expression in rodents (18).
however, the direct effect of various nutrients on ppar␥
gene expression is not well-documented. long-chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas) are good candidates as
putative regulators of ppar␥ expression. indeed, it has
been recently shown that infusion of a triglyceride mixture
for 5 hours was able to promote a marked increase in
ppar␥ mrna expression in human subcutaneous adipose
tissue (19). in animal models as well, ppar␥ gene expression responded to dietary  xxxd2154xxx . for example, feeding
with a diet supplemented with safflower oil induced a 4-fold
increase in ppar␥ mrna in pig adipose tissue (20). however, the nature of the  xxxd2154xxx  that could participate in the
transcriptional regulation of the ppar␥ gene is not known.
the aim of the present study was to verify whether fatty
acids, particularly pufas, directly regulate ppar␥ gene
expression in human adipose tissue. in this study, we have
investigated the effect of various  xxxd2154xxx  on ppar␥
expression in freshly isolated human adipocytes, and we
have attempted to demonstrate an in vivo association between plasma concentrations of specific  xxxd2154xxx  and
the mrna expression level of ppar␥ in subcutaneous
fat biopsies.

research methods and procedures
preparation of human isolated adipocytes
abdominal subcutaneous adipose-tissue samples were
obtained from 14 non-diabetic patients [9 women and 5
men; age range, 61 ⫾ 4 years; body mass index (bmi),
28 ⫾ 1 kg/m2; glycemia, 5.4 ⫾ 0. 2 mm]. the samples were
taken during elective surgery, after approval of the protocol
by the ethical committee of the hospices civils de lyon
(france) and with the informed consent of the patients. the
tissue (10 ⫾ 1 g wet weight; n ⫽ 14) was immediately
immersed in hanks’ medium kept at 4 °c, and cell preparation was started within 15 minutes after tissue sampling.
adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion (0.5 mg/

ml; type ii; sigma, la verpillère, france) according to the
method of rodbell (21) with the modifications previously
described (17). isolated adipocytes were incubated at 37 °c
in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (life technologies, cergy pontoise, france) containing 4% fatty-acid-free
bovine  xxxg124xxx  in a final volume of 1 ml. the
average cell number in the incubation medium varied from
50,000 to 150,000 cells/ml. cells were incubated 30 minutes at 37 °c before the addition of the different agents or
vehicle. the viability and the metabolic integrity of the cells
prepared and incubated under these conditions have been
verified (17). at the end of the incubation periods, the
infranatant was removed by aspiration and cells were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen before total rna
preparation.
products
 xxxd2154xxx  were obtained from sigma (l’isle d’abeau,
france) and biomol research laboratories (plymouth
meeting, pa). stock solutions (50 mm) were prepared in
 xxxd102xxx  (etoh) and stored at ⫺20 °c in glass
tubes, away from light. to obtain the desired concentrations, small amounts of stock solution were added, while
stirring gently to prewarmed (37 °c) ␣-minimum essential
medium containing 4% fatty acid-free bovine  xxxg124xxx . dilutions were held at 37 °c for at least 1 hour before
addition to the cells, and the final concentration of etoh
was always kept below 0.2%. wy-14643 (ppar␣ agonist)
was obtained from biomol research laboratories. rosiglitazone (ppar␥ agonist) was kindly provided by smithkline
beecham pharmaceuticals (harlow, united kingdom) and
 xxxd745xxx  (ppar␤ agonist) was a gift from j. berger and d.
moller from merck & co., inc. (rahway, nj). solutions of the
ppar agonists were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide.
in vivo study and analytical procedures
eleven nondiabetic largely obese women were involved
in the in vivo part of the study (age, 47 ⫾ 3 years; bmi,
40.5 ⫾ 2.3 kg/m2; fasting glycemia, 5.5 ⫾ 0.2 mm; fasting
insulinemia, 11 ⫾ 2 mu/l). the experimental protocol was
approved by the ethical committee of assistance publiquehôpitaux de paris (france) and performed in la salpêtrière
hospital in paris (france). all subjects gave their written
consent after being informed of the nature, purpose, and
possible risks of the study. apart from obesity, all subjects
were in good health and had stable body weight for at least
12 months. they did not take any medication affecting
adipocyte metabolism. subcutaneous adipose-tissue biopsies
were taken after an overnight fast with the percutaneous miniliposuction method described previously (22). adipose tissue
samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at ⫺80 °c until total rna preparation.
venous-blood samples were taken a few minutes before
the fat biopsy in the fasting state. blood glucose was asobesity research vol. 10 no. 6 june 2002

sayed enzymatically using a multiparametric analyzer (hitachi 911; boehringer mannheim, meylan, france). serum
insulin was measured with commercial radioimmunoassay
(bi-insulin irma; eria-pasteur, paris, france). serum
fatty-acid composition was determined by gas liquid chromatography as reported previously (23). briefly, total lipids
were extracted according to the method of bligh and dyer
(24). after evaporation of the chloroform phase, lipids were
transesterified with methanolic koh/bf3 and fatty-acid
methyl esters were extracted with hexane. they were then
separated and quantified by gas liquid chromatography using heptadecanoic acid (c17:0) as the internal standard.
total rna preparation and determination of ppar␥
mrna expression
total rna from the isolated adipocytes and the adipose
tissue biopsies were prepared with the rneasy total rna
kit from qiagen (courtaboeuf, france) as recommended
previously (25). the quality of the preparations was verified
by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 260 nm. the 260/280 nm absorption ratio of all
preparations was between 1.8 and 2.0. for fat biopsies, the
average yield of total rna was 2.4 ⫾ 0.2 ␮g/100 mg of
tissue. for the isolated adipocytes, the average yield was ⬃1
␮g of total rna for 100,000 cells.
the mrna concentrations of ppar␥1 and ppar␥2
were determined by reverse-transcription (rt) reaction followed by competitive polymerase chain reaction (cpcr).
the method consists, after a specific reverse-transcription
reaction, in the coamplification of the target cdnas with
known amounts of a specific competitor dna in the same
tube (26). the construction of the competitor dna molecule, the sequence of the primers, the validation and the
experimental conditions of the rt-cpcr assay have been
described in detail previously (4).
statistical analysis
data are presented as means ⫾ sem. significance of the
correlations was examined by the nonparametric spearman’s rank correlation test. other statistical analyses were
performed with the student’s t test for paired values or the
nonparametric wilcoxon’s test for paired data. the threshold for significance was set at p ⱕ 0.05.

absolute mrna concentrations of ppar␥1 and
ppar␥2 were determined in human isolated adipocytes by
rt-cpcr. ppar␥2 mrna abundance represents ⬃15% of
the total ppar␥ mrnas, in agreement with previous studies (4,17,18). figure 1 shows the effect of various  xxxd2154xxx

(c20:5n-3). docosahexaenoic acid (dha) (c22:6n-3) had
no significant effect, although the results were highly variable between experiments (figure 1).  xxxd2490xxx  (c18:
3n-3), a precursor of epa, also did not change ppar␥1
mrna levels. moreover, none of the pufas from the ␻-6
series affected ppar␥ expression in human adipocytes. a
higher concentration (100 ␮m) of  xxxd208xxx  (c20:
4n-6) also had no effect (data not shown). in contrast to
ppar␥1, ppar␥2 mrna expression levels were not affected by any of the tested  xxxd2154xxx  (figure 1). in addition,
incubation with epa (50 ␮m, 6 hours) did not affect
significantly the mrna expression of ppar␣ (2.5 ⫾ 0.5

the effect of epa on ppar␥1 mrna was further confirmed in additional cell preparations. as shown in figure 2,

with concentrations higher than 100 ␮m, ppar␥1 mrna
levels returned to basal values (figure 3). dha did not
affect ppar␥1 or -␥2 mrna expression when added at
final concentrations of 50, 100, or 200 ␮m for 6 hours (data
not shown).

to verify whether the induction of ppar␥1 expression
by epa was mediated by the activation of a nuclear receptor
of the ppar family, specific agonists of the different
ppars were tested (final concentration, 1 ␮m). as shown
in figure 4, rosiglitazone (activator of ppar␥), wy-14643
(activator of ppar␣), and  xxxd745xxx  (activator of ppar␤)
did not affect the mrna expression of ppar␥1 and
ppar␥2 in human adipocytes after 6 hours of incubation.
to assess whether the compounds were active in adipocytes,
we verified whether the mrna expression of known target
genes of these nuclear receptors were affected by the treatments. incubation with rosiglitazone produced a 83 ⫾ 12%
(p ⫽ 0.03) increase in p85␣ xxxg1743xxx -kinase and a 103 ⫾ 24%

the potential contribution of the observed effect of epa
on the in vivo expression of ppar␥ in adipose tissue was
investigated in 11 obese women. the concentrations of
individual  xxxd2154xxx  (saturated, monounsaturated, ␻-3 pufas, ␻-6 pufas, and ␻-9 pufas) were determined in

some years ago (16) and, unfortunately, only total ppar␥
(␥1 ⫹ ␥2) mrna has been determined at that time. the
lack of remaining material did not allow us to subsequently
measure ppar␥2 and ppar␥1 mrnas individually. we
have however shown previously that ppar␥1 represents
⬎80% of the total ppar␥ transcripts in human adipose
tissue (4,17). ppar␥ mrna concentrations displayed large
individual variations (62 ⫾ 8 amol/␮g of total rna, ranging from 20 to 108 amol/␮g of total rna), and were not
correlated with the bmi, the glycemia, or the insulinemia of
the subjects (data not shown). a strong positive correlation
(r ⫽ 0.76; p ⫽ 0.016) was found between serum epa
concentrations and ppar␥ mrna levels in adipose tissue
(figure 5), suggesting that the effect of epa observed in
vitro in isolated adipocytes may influence ppar␥ expression in vivo. as shown also in figure 5, the positive correlation observed with epa was also significant with dha
(r ⫽ 0.86; p ⫽ 0.006). it was of note that epa and dha
serum concentrations were also strongly and positively correlated (r ⫽ 0.81; p ⫽ 0.003). in contrast to these ␻-3

discussion

the ppar␥ transcription factors are key regulators of
adipocyte differentiation, adipose tissue lipid metabolism,
and whole-body insulin resistance (9,10,27). in this study,

effect of  xxxd2318xxx  in adipocytes, chambrier et al.

we demonstrated that epa positively regulates the expression of ppar␥1 in isolated human adipocytes and that this
effect is likely to contribute to the in vivo expression levels
of ppar␥ in human subcutaneous adipose tissue.
in freshly isolated adipocytes, the increase in ppar␥
mrna was specifically induced by epa. pufas from the
␻-6 series, like  xxxd208xxx , did not affect ppar␥
expression.  xxxd208xxx  can lead to intracellular ligands of ppar␥, such as prostaglandin j2 derivatives
(28,29). our data suggest, therefore, that ppar␥ probably
does not regulate the expression of its own gene in human
adipocytes. this conclusion was in line with the lack of
effect of rosiglitazone, a potent activator of ppar␥, and is
also in agreement with previous results obtained in human
fat cells (30). in rodent adipose cell lines, however, activation of ppar␥ with thiazolidinediones appeared to reduce
ppar␥ expression (31), suggesting that there may be species-related differences in the regulation of the ppar␥ gene
in adipocytes.
in view of the marked effect of epa, it was surprising to
find that ppar␥ expression was not affected by linolenic
acid, a direct precursor of epa. it is likely that the metabolism of  xxxd2490xxx  was not efficient enough to lead to an
effective concentration of epa in the isolated cells. the
short incubation period used in this study, as required by the
low viability of the human adipocytes in suspension, might
have limited the formation of epa in vitro. dha is a
metabolite of epa, and in contrast to epa, it did not affect
ppar␥ mrna expression in adipocytes. however, there
was a correlation between ppar␥ mrna levels in adipose
tissue and the serum concentrations of dha in vivo. because there is an efficient interconversion between epa and
dha in vivo, as well as a very strong correlation between
their concentrations in serum, it is likely that this apparent
association between dha concentrations and ppar␥
mrna concentrations in vivo reflected the effect of epa,
rather than a direct action of dha. it is important to note
that the concentrations of epa found in the serum of the
obese subjects (ranging from 20 to 180 ␮m) were in agreement with data from the literature (32) and in the same
range as the concentrations of epa that were effective on
ppar␥ expression in vitro in isolated adipocytes.
differential effects of epa and dha have been previously described, in vitro and in vivo (33–35). for example,
it has been recently demonstrated that epa, but not dha,
induces carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 mrna and increases mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation in hepatocytes
(36). a proposed mechanism for these differential effects
might be a different intracellular oxidative metabolism of
epa and dha (36,37). little is known regarding the metabolism of pufas in adipocytes. our data showing a
specific effect of epa on ppar␥ expression may thus
suggest distinct metabolic pathway for epa and dha,
leading, for example, to the production of specific eico-

sanoid derivatives. however, because of a high mortality
rate of adipocytes in the presence of cyclo- and lipooxygenase inhibitors, we were not able to verify whether or not
the conversion of epa into eicosanoids was involved in the
induction of ppar␥ expression (data not shown). alternatively, it can be speculated that the regulatory machinery
involved in the control of ppar␥ gene expression selectively recognizes epa or one of its derivatives. epa has
been shown to be a possible ligand of the ppars (38). we
found, however, that the activation of the different ppars
with synthetic agonists had no effect on ppar␥ expression
level in human adipocytes, suggesting thus that the effect of
epa is not mediated by one of the members of the ppar
family. one could argue that the lack of effect of the ppar
agonists was a consequence of a low level of rxr, the
partner of the ppars to form transcriptionally active heterodimers (1,2). this was unlikely because we have observed, in agreement with previous publications (30,39),
significant effects of rosiglitazone and wy-14643 on the
mrna expression of other genes (p85␣ xxxg1743xxx -kinase and
ucp-2) in the absence of an added rxr ligand.
an important result of the present study is the fact that
epa increased ppar␥1 mrna concentrations and had no
effect on the mrna levels of ppar␥2, ppar␣, and
ppar␤, the other members of the ppar family. the generation of ppar␥1 and -␥2 mrna variants is under the
control of distinct promoters in the same gene (3). it seemed
thus that epa affects only the promoter involved in the
transcription of ppar␥1. recently, a third promoter has
been described in the ppar␥ gene that leads to the production of a new transcript named ppar␥3 (40). ppar␥1 and
␥3 mrnas differ only in their 5⬘ untranslated regions and
thus lead to the same protein (40). the primers of the
rt-cpcr assay used in this study were located in a common region (4); therefore, it was not possible to discriminate
between an effect of epa on ppar␥1 or ppar␥3 or both.
however, because the two mrnas encoded the same protein, the biological consequence of their increased expression is expected to be the same (40). alternatively to an
effect on the promoters, we could not exclude a specific
effect of epa on the stability of ppar␥ mrna. this
possibility could not have been tested in the present study
because of a strong effect of  xxxd1800xxx  d on the survival
rate of the isolated cells (data not shown). the mechanism
by which epa up-regulates ppar␥1 mrna expression in
human adipocytes remains to be determined.
in contrast to ppar␥2, which is expressed almost exclusively in adipose tissue, where it is regarded as a major
regulator of adipogenesis (9), ppar␥1 is more widely distributed, with significant expression levels in the intestinal
tract and in macrophages (4 –7). the presence of ppar␥1
in macrophages and the regulation of specific target genes
in these cells strongly support a role of this nuclear receptor
in inflammation and in atherosclerosis (12,13), in addition

to its role in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity (9,27).
moreover, several lines of evidences indicate that ppar␥1
can also participate in the regulation of cell proliferation and
apoptosis in a wide range of cell types, including tumor cells
(14,41). interestingly, several of the beneficial effects of the
␻-3 pufas have been reported in these different fields,
including improvement of lipid metabolism (42), reduction
of insulin resistance (43), association with a low mortality
of cardiovascular disease (42,44), and reduction of cancer
risk (45), possibly by induction of cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in tumor cells (46). the parallelism between
ppar␥ functions and the well known in vivo effects of the
␻-3 pufas could suggest that part of their mechanism of
action may involve an induction by epa of ppar␥1. further studies are required to test this attractive hypothesis in
cell types other than adipocytes.
in summary, the present study demonstrates that
ppar␥1, but not ppar␥2, mrna expression is acutely
induced by epa in human adipocytes. this effect is dependent on the concentration of epa and was not observed with
␻-6 pufas or with dha. there is also a strong correlation
between ppar␥ mrna levels in subcutaneous adipose
tissue and plasma epa concentrations in a group of obese
subjects, strongly suggesting that the positive effect of epa
observed in isolated adipocytes can participate in the in vivo
regulation of ppar␥ expression in human tissue. in view of
the effects of epa in several pathologies (i.e., cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, cancer) and of the emerging
roles of ppar␥ in these disorders, our finding, if confirmed
in other cell types, may provide an additional molecular
mechanism for the beneficial actions of epa.
