two mechanisms of  xxxd394xxx  action in candida albicans.  the mechanism of action of a new  xxxd314xxx  antimycotic,  xxxd394xxx  hydrochloride, was studied in candida albicans by using the thiocarbamate antimycotic tolnaftate as a reference drug.  xxxd394xxx  completely inhibited the growth of a test strain of c. albicans at 25 micrograms/ml and was  xxxd3440xxx  at 50 micrograms/ml. tolnaftate did not show any growth-inhibitory activity up to 100 micrograms/ml. both  xxxd394xxx  and tolnaftate inhibited squalene epoxidation in c. albicans, with 50% inhibitory concentrations being 0.57 and 0.17 microgram/ml, respectively.  xxxd394xxx , but not tolnaftate, induced the release of appreciable amounts of pi from c. albicans cells at 12.5 micrograms/ml. this effect of  xxxd394xxx  was augmented when the cells were pretreated with tolnaftate. the results suggest that the direct membrane-damaging effect of  xxxd394xxx  may play a major role in its anticandidal activity and that the drug-induced alteration in the cellular sterol composition renders the cell membrane more susceptible to the membrane-damaging effect of this drug.
