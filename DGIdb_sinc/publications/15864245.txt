background

h-blocker therapy improves symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), and survival in patients
with congestive heart failure, but chronic effects on neurohormones have not been extensively investigated. therefore, we
examined the neurohumoral effects of carvedilol.

methods

fifty-five patients with new york heart association (nyha) classes ii-iii congestive heart failure and lvef
v35% entered the study with intention to assess lvef, nyha class, plasma brain natriuretic peptide (bnp), n-terminal atrial
natriuretic peptide (nanp), big-endothelin,  xxxg674xxx , norepinephrine, and  xxxg99xxx  at baseline and at 6 and 12
months after initiation of carvedilol.

results

forty-six patients completed 12 months of follow-up. left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 26% f 8%
at baseline to 39% f 14% at 12 months. new york heart association class improved from 2.3 f 0.4 at baseline to 1.8 f
0.7 at 12 months. brain natriuretic peptide fell from 453 f 784 to 208 f 393 pg/ml at 6 months and 223 f 334 pg/ml at
12 months ( p = .01 vs baseline). n-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide did not change between baseline and 6 months but fell
at 12 months (2117 f 1678, 2015 f 1532, and 1438 f 1442 pg/ml, respectively, p = .001 between baseline and
12 months).  xxxg99xxx  was lower at 6 and 12 months than at baseline (12.6 f 10, 7.8 f 5.5 pg/ml, p b 0.001, and
11.3 f 17.1 pg/ml, p = .02, respectively). left ventricular ejection fraction at 12 months correlated inversely with bnp level at
12 months (r = 0.55, p = .001).

conclusions carvedilol therapy is associated with a sustained decline in bnp and nanp levels. serial bnp levels can
provide some guidance regarding probability of lvef improvement, but the relationship is not strong enough for bnp levels to
supplant measurement of lvef. (am heart j 2005;149:541- 7.)
carvedilol improves symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), and survival in patients with
congestive heart failure (chf).1,2 neurohumoral activation is characteristic of chf, and the magnitude of
activation correlates with disease severity. various
neurohumoral markers have been associated with
prognosis in chf, but brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) is
the most widely embraced marker particularly given the

availability of a rapid point-of-care assay.3 however, the
effect of h-blockade on bnp and other neurohumoral
markers has not been extensively studied in chf.
improving ejection fraction, regression of hypertrophy,
and declining cardiac filling pressures are expected to
result in a decline in release of cardiac hormones.
however, in systemic hypertension, h -blockade has
been associated with an increase in natriuretic peptide
levels.4 -7 if this were true in chf, it would undermine
the utility of bnp levels in following up patients who are
treated with contemporary chf therapy. because neurohormones generally decline with improving chf, we
hypothesized that chronic carvedilol therapy would be
associated with a decline in bnp levels and that extent
of decline would relate to extent of improvement in
lvef. we also hypothesized that carvedilol may be
associated with a decline in markers of activation of
the atrial natriuretic, sympathetic, endothelin, and reninangiotensin systems. therefore, we measured bnp,

who were initiating carvedilol therapy.

sample size was chosen on the basis of power to detect a
change in et-1 levels with carvedilol therapy. we estimated
that 42 patients would be necessary to have 80% power (56
patients for 90% power) to detect a change in et-1 at least as
great as that demonstrated by krum et al.13 our sample size
was also chosen to provide 80% power to be able to detect a
correlation of 0.39 or higher between change in et-1 and
change in lvef.
results are presented as mean f sd or as the median with
the 25th and 75th percentiles. spearman rank correlation was
used to assess the relationship between lvef and the
neurohumoral levels. the associations between the nyha class
and the neurohumoral levels were tested using the wilcoxon
rank tests. the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to test for
changes between 2 periods in neurohumoral levels, nyha
class, and lvef. linear regression was used to assess the
associations between the lvef and the natural logarithm of
bnp at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. linear regression was
also used to look at the relationship between the change from
baseline in ejection fraction and the change from baseline in
bnp and nanp.

methods
the study was reviewed and approved by the mayo clinic
institutional research board, and informed consent was
obtained from all participants. fifty-five patients with new
york heart association (nyha) classes ii-iii chf and lvef
v35% underwent assessment of left ventricular (lv) function
by echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography and had
venous neurohumoral profiles obtained at baseline with intent
to repeat them 6 and 12 months after initiation of carvedilol.
patients were on stable therapy with angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ace) inhibitors for at least 1 month, diuretics, and
digoxin if indicated and tolerated, before study enrollment.
carvedilol was initiated at 3.125 mg bid, and the dose doubled
every 2 weeks until reaching 25 mg bid (50 mg bid for patients
n85 kg) or highest tolerated dose. blood samples were
obtained from an indwelling intravenous catheter after a 30minute period of supine rest. plasma nanp and bnp (shionogi
method) were measured by radioimmunoassay as previously
described.8,9 plasma big-et and et-1 were determined by
radioimmunoassay systems from phoenix pharmaceuticals and
amersham, respectively.10,11 plasma ang ii was measured by
radioimmunoassay by a modification of the technique reported
by urata et al.12 norepinephrine was measured by highperformance liquid chromatography.

results
fifty-five patients entered the study. demographics are
shown in table i.
the majority of patients had nonischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy. nine patients did not complete the
study (4 declined to return, 1 had sudden death, 1 had
transplant for chf, and 3 stopped drug because of
intolerance [1 had fatigue, 1 had asthma, and 1 had
muscle cramps]). mean total daily carvedilol dose was
41 mg. one-year survival free of transplant or death
was 96%. forty-six patients remained on carvedilol and
returned for serial testing at 6 and 12 months
including reassessment of functional class, ejection
fraction, and neurohormones.

neurohormones did not have significant associations
with nyha class.

serial lvef, nyha class, and neurohumoral levels
between baseline and 6 months, mean lvef improved
from 26% f 8% to 36% f 13% in association with a
decline in bnp and ang ii, but no change in measured
concentrations of the other neurohormones (table iv).
mean nyha class improved from 2.3 f 0.4 to 1.7 f 0.6
( p = .001, table iv). the improvement in nyha class
and lvef was maintained after 12 months of carvedilol
therapy. brain natriuretic peptide at 12 months
remained significantly lower than at baseline but was
unchanged compared with 6 months. interestingly,
nanp also fell significantly by 12 months, although no
change was seen after 6 months of carvedilol therapy.
 xxxg99xxx  declined significantly between baseline
and 6 months but was not significantly different
between 6 and 12 months.
correlation between the change in lvef between
baseline and 12 months and the 12-month
neurohumoral levels
bnp levels at 12 months correlated inversely with the
change in lvef between baseline and 12 months (r =
0.40, p = .007). a trend toward significant relationship
between 12-month et-1 levels and the change in lvef
was seen (r = 0.31, p = .08). only 17 patients had
measurement of et-1 levels, resulting in low power for
this analysis. there was no correlation between the
other neurohumoral levels at 12 months and the change
in lvef.
the relationship between bnp levels and lvef at
baseline and at 6 and 12 months is depicted in figure
1a,b,c. an inverse correlation between bnp level and
lvef was present at all time points, and the relationship
became progressively stronger with the duration of
therapy (r = 0.33, p = .02 at baseline; r = 0.38, p = .02
at 6 months; and r = 0.55, p b .001 at 12 months). at
baseline, 9 patients had a bnp level b55 pg/ml (lnbnp

b4.0), despite the presence of lvef b35%. after 12
months of carvedilol therapy, 15 patients had a bnp level
b55 pg/ml, and 14 (93%) of these 15 had lvef n35%. in
8 of 9 patients with an ef n50% at 1 year, bnp level was
b55 pg/ml. these results suggest that low bnp levels in
patients treated chronically with carvedilol are associated
with restoration of ventricular function. nine patients
had bnp levels n300 pg/ml (lnbnp n5.7) at 1 year; of
these patients, none had an lvef n50%, and 5 (56%) had
lvef b35%. six patients had a decline in lvef over the
12-month study period; 5 (83%) of 6 had a rise in bnp.
figures 2 and 3 depict the relationship between
change in lnbnp (lnbnp at follow-up lnbnp at
baseline) and change in lvef between baseline and 6
and 12 months, respectively. natural log transformation
was used for this analysis because of the large range in
bnp values. the strength of the relationship between
bnp and lvef was greater at 12 months than at 6
months. a decline in bnp was most often associated
with an improvement in lvef, and a rise in bnp was
often associated with either deterioration or more
limited improvement in lvef. however, 10 patients had
an increase in lvef of 5 units or more despite a rise in
bnp between baseline and 6 months. at 12 months, only
4 patients who had a rise in bnp had an increase in lvef
of 5 units or more.
figure 4 plots the change in lnnanp and the change in
lvef between baseline and 12 months. most patients
had a decline in nanp, but there was no significant
relationship to change in lvef.
figures 5a and b show the distribution of bnp levels
and nyha class at baseline and 12 months. natural log
transformations were used because of the wide range in
values. at both baseline and 12 months, mean bnp
levels were significantly higher in patients with higher
nyha class.

to therapy.8,13-22 following n-terminal bnp levels has
been shown in a prior investigation to result in
improved clinical outcomes compared with standard

management.23 however, b10% of patients in that study
were treated with h-blockers, potentially limiting applicability of the findings to contemporary chf management. h-blocker therapy has been associated with
increased natriuretic peptide levels in systemic hypertension, leading some investigators to speculate that
augmentation of natriuretic peptides may be part of the
mechanism responsible for efficacy of h-blockers in the
therapy of lv dysfunction.24 if this were true, following

figure 4

change in ln nanp and change in lvef after 12 months of
carvedilol. no significant relationship was found.

bnp levels in patients with chf who are being treated
with h-blockers might not be prognostically useful.
despite the paucity of information regarding effects of
h-blockade on bnp levels in chf, bnp is rapidly becoming
the most widely followed neurohumoral marker in chf,
reflecting the availability of a point-of-care assay.3
accordingly, we examined the temporal course of
neurohumoral parameters after h-blockade and the
relationship between changes in neurohormones and
clinical response. because 9 (16%) of 55 patients had low
(b55 pg/ml) bnp levels at baseline despite presence of
lv dysfunction and a clinical indication for h-blockade, it
is apparent that the sensitivity of the shionogi bnp
measurement for detecting lv dysfunction in stable
outpatients is imperfect. using serial bnp levels to predict
improvement of lv function is unlikely to be useful in
patients who are starting out with low bnp levels.
we observed that carvedilol therapy is generally
associated with a decline in bnp, nanp, and ang ii levels,
but that the time course of these changes varies
depending on which marker is being studied. in addition,
we found that the strength of the inverse relationship
between bnp levels and ejection fraction is timedependent. this finding may relate to the interplay
between multiple factors that affect plasma bnp levels,
including atrial and ventricular stretch, ventricular hypertrophy, and the complex effects of h-blockade in chf.
improvement in the inverse correlation also reflects the
emergence of a significant subset of patients who greatly
improved their ejection fractions with carvedilol, associated with concomitant normalization of bnp levels.
our findings have implications for the use of bnp
levels as a surrogate for ejection fraction in patients
treated with h-blockade. ten patients had improvement
in lvef n5 units at 6 months despite rising bnp levels,

frantz et al 545

whereas only 4 patients had improvement in lvef n5
units at 12 months despite rising bnp levels. this
suggests a time-dependent relationship. a low bnp level
(b55 pg/ml) at 12 months was highly predictive of
restoration of lvef to a value n35% (14 of 15 patients). it
appears that a longer duration of h-blocker therapy is
more likely to be associated with declining bnp levels,
perhaps reflecting further decline in cardiac filling
pressures and incremental effects on remodeling. brain
natriuretic peptide measurement at 12 months was quite
useful in distinguishing those patients who had normalized their lv function from those who had not. however,
bnp levels were not reliably able to distinguish patients
with varying degrees of impairment in lv function and
so do not serve as a good surrogate for ef among patients
with persisting lv dysfunction. this likely reflects the
multiple factors that influence bnp levels that extend
beyond simple measures of ejection fraction and may
also highlight the known limitations of ejection fraction
as a prognostic marker.
fujimora et al25 measured bnp, atrial natriuretic
peptide, and ne levels before and 3 to 5 months after
initiation of carvedilol in 42 patients with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy and demonstrated a decline in
bnp in patients who had an improvement in lvef. they
also observed a decline in anp levels in responders, with
no change in nonresponders, and no overall change in ne
levels. kawai et al26 measured bnp levels before and 2
and 6 months after initiation of carvedilol in 21 patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy. they also found that bnp
levels declined and that bnp levels correlated inversely
with lvef after 6 months of therapy. our results extend
these observations by evaluating changes over a full year
in a larger cohort and by measuring nanp rather than
anp, in addition to measuring big-et, et-1, and ang ii.
in our study, the temporal difference in decline of bnp
and nanp levels after initiation of carvedilol suggests
that these neurohormones are independently regulated.
plasma levels reflect a balance between production,
release, and clearance. we believe that bnp may be a
marker of both ventricular stress and mass, whereas
nanp may primarily reflect atrial stretch and volume.
the decline in bnp at 6 and 12 months likely reflects
beneficial effects of carvedilol on myocardial structure
and function (reverse remodeling). the more gradual
decline in nanp illustrates the complexity of the
natriuretic peptide system and may reflect greater
decline in atrial stretch between 6 and 12 months as
myocardial function recovers and hemodynamics continue to improve. it has been reported that pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure actually declines during shortterm administration of carvedilol.27 however, there is a
tendency for some patients to experience fluid retention
after initiation of h-blockers including carvedilol, and so
perhaps, this source of atrial stretch explains the delay
in decline in nanp.

the decline in ang ii at 6 months may reflect reduced
activation of the renin-angiotensin system as a consequence of improved lv function, and inhibitory effects
of h-blockade on the ras system.  xxxg99xxx  levels
were not significantly different between 6 and 12
months, despite reports of possibility of bescapeq of the
angiotensin system from ace inhibition.28 we had
hypothesized that carvedilol might result in a decline in
big-et or et-1 levels, because carvedilol has been
shown to inhibit et-1 synthesis in cultured human
coronary endothelial cells,29 but we did not observe
such a change.

practical implications
determining whether and when patients with lv
dysfunction should undergo repeat measurement of
ventricular function is a matter of controversy. detecting

american heart journal
march 2005

persistent lv dysfunction may be important in deciding
whether prophylactic defibrillator implantation is appropriate or in identifying patients who may be at higher
risk of adverse outcomes. our data suggest that persistently elevated bnp levels, despite 12 months of optimal
chf therapy including h-blockade, are often associated
with persistent systolic dysfunction and may serve as a
rationale for repeat assessment of lv function. normal
bnp levels, despite 12 months of optimal therapy, were
nearly always associated in our study with restoration of
lv function. accordingly, if the goal of repeat assessment
of lv function is to detect persistent severe dysfunction,
a normal bnp level may suggest low yield for such an
approach. however, most of our patients had nonischemic cardiomyopathy; whether these findings are
applicable to an ischemic population is unknown. in
addition, detection of greatly improved lv function can
have important positive reinforcement for patient compliance and reassurance.

study limitations
there is no placebo control group, and so it is possible
that factors other than carvedilol could have contributed
to the observed findings. however, all patients were on
standard chf therapy before the addition of carvedilol,
and so we believe that the findings can be attributed to
effects of carvedilol. a placebo-controlled design would
be unethical, because h-blockade represents current
standard of care for chf. a larger study might detect
effects of carvedilol on the other neurohumoral systems
that we were unable to detect with our sample size. most
patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and
exhibited substantial improvement in ventricular function. accordingly, our findings may not apply to other
populations. the shionogi assay used for bnp measurement is not the same as the biosite method currently
often used for point-of-care applications; performance
and characteristics of these assays may differ. we did not
measure bnp levels during up-titration of carvedilol.
such data would be of interest because it may help
distinguish patients who have worsening hemodynamics
during titration from those who do not. in addition,
whether other h-blockers such as metoprolol exhibit the
same effects on these neurohumoral markers is uncertain; it is possible that effects may differ because of
pharmacological differences between carvedilol and
other h-blocking agents.
conclusions
carvedilol therapy is associated with a decline in bnp
and improvement in nyha functional class and lvef in
patients with chf. furthermore, a significant relationship exists between the magnitude of change in bnp
and the magnitude of improvement in ventricular
function during chronic carvedilol therapy. failure of
elevated bnp levels to decline after chronic therapy with

american heart journal
volume 149, number 3

carvedilol is generally predictive of patients who have
failed to improve their ejection fractions. low bnp
levels after 12 months of carvedilol therapy were
associated with a high likelihood of improvement in lv
function in our patient population.
nanp levels decline more gradually than bnp levels
after initiation of carvedilol, suggesting that independent factors are responsible for determining plasma
levels of these 2 natriuretic peptides in patients with
chf. the observation that bnp and nanp do not
move in lockstep has implications for the understanding of natriuretic peptide system regulation, the
physiology of response to carvedilol, and the use of
natriuretic peptide levels in monitoring patients with
heart failure. our 12-month data support the concept
that serial monitoring of plasma bnp concentrations
may be useful in monitoring the response of patients
with chf treated with carvedilol, but such monitoring
seems unlikely to supplant serial determinations of
ejection fraction.
