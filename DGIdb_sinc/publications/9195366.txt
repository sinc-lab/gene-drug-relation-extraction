abstract this is a report of a phase i1 study of  xxxd2557xxx  (160 mg/day, orally) in the

treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). forty-six patients with advanced hcc were studied and
tumour response, changes in appetite, bodyweight, a feeling of well-being, survival and toxicity were
evaluated. thirty-two patients were able to be evaluated for response; there were no complete
responders or partial responders. twelve patients (38%) had stable disease and seven of these patients
had a minor response with a median size reduction in the tumour of 18%. twenty patients (62%) had
progressive disease. five of 24 (21%) patients had a median reduction in a-fetoprotein levels of
59ng/ml. the overall median survival was 4 months (range 1 week to 27 months). twenty of 32
(62%) patients had an increased appetite and feeling of well-being. fourteen of 22 (64%) patients had
a median lean bodyweight gain of 5 kg (range 1-14 kg). toxicities were minimal. tests for glucocorticoid receptors were performed in 10 patients. four of five patients who were positive for glucocorticoid receptors in the tumour had a stable disease and all five patients who were negative for
glucocorticoid receptors had progressive disease.  xxxd2557xxx  had no significant effect on the
tumour in hcc patients. however,  xxxd2557xxx  is useful in the palliative management of hcc
patients, with improvements in appetite, bodyweight and a feeling of well-being with minimal side
effects. some patients had stable disease, a minor reduction of tumour size and a prolonged survival
after  xxxd2557xxx  treatment and this response may be related to the presence of glucocorticoid
receptors in the hcc tumour.
key words: hepatocellular carcinoma, hormonal therapy,  xxxd2557xxx .

introduction
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is one of the most
common cancers in the world.’ the overall prognosis of
hcc is very poor. surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for hcc and is most effective
for small turn our^.^,^ unfortunately, many patients have
tumour recurrence after surgery and most patients are
not suitable candidates for surgery because of the
advanced stage of the disease at presentation. other
treatments, such as conventional r a d i ~ t h e r a p y ~or
.~
chernothera~y,~-’are ineffective and the results are
unsatisfactory. embolization for hcc may be palliative.r some of these treatments may have significant

side effects. new effective methods of treatment for
hcc are urgently needed.
several clinical observations suggest that hcc may
be a hormone-dependent tumour; including an apparent
relationship to steroid sex hormones and male predominance.’-” steroid hormone receptors have been found
in hcc cell lines, animals and human hcc.1z-l5
glucocorticoid antagonists, such as progesterone or
ru486, suppress a-fetoprotein (afp) expression in
human hepatoma cell l i n e ~ ’ ~ and
j ’ also regulate the in
vivo growth of mouse hepatoma.’* hormonal therapies
have been trialled in a small number of hcc patients
with varying result^.^^'^^"^^  xxxd2557xxx , an orally
active synthetic progesteronal agent, was reported to be

effective in the treatment of hcc patients in one small
study and hormonal therapy for hcc was considered
worthy of further clinical investigation.13,22,23
therefore,
the present phase i1 study was performed in order to
further investigate the clinical efficacy of megesterol

were reviewed independently by a radiologist and two
gastroenterologists.
response, toxicities and performance status were
graded according to the eastern co-operative oncology
group (ecog) criteria.24
patients with ascites or oedema were excluded from
the evaluation of weight gain. appetite and a feeling of
well-being were assessed using patient questionaires,

methods
eligibility
patients were required to have measurable, pathologically confirmed inoperable or metastatic hcc.
patients who were not suitable for biopsy due to prolonged prothrombin time secondary to impaired liver
function needed to have afp levels >400nglml and
typical hepatic angiogram findings of hcc. patients
who had failed hepatic resection, embolization or
chemotherapy were eligible for entry into the present
study. patients with a poor general physical condition or
who had impaired bone marrow, liver or renal function
that was unsuitable for treatment by any other means
were also eligible for entry into the study. patients with
history of thrombo-embolism, congestive cardiac failure, diabetes or other contraindications for steroid therapy were excluded from the study. informed consent
was obtained from each patient prior to their participation in the study.

treatment
 xxxd2557xxx  was given at a dose of 160 mglday,
orally. treatment was continued for a minimum of 2
months or until progressive disease was noted.

evaluations
a complete assessment of each patient, including
appetite, bodyweight, feeling of well-being, physical
examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, afp, chest x-ray, computed tomography (ct)
scan or ultrasound (us) of the liver, was performed
before  xxxd2557xxx  treatment; assessments were
repeated on a monthly basis. complete response (cr)
was defined as the disappearance of all measurable
disease for 4 weeks and partial response (pr) was
defined as a reduction of >50% in the sum of the
products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all
measurable lesions for 4 weeks when compared with
pretreatment measurements. stable disease (sd)was
defined as a -30% reduction or <25% increase in the
sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular
diameters of all measurable lesions when compared
with pretreatment measurements and without the
appearance of any new lesions for 4 weeks. progressive
disease (pd) was defined as a >25% increase in the
s u m of the products of the greatest perpendicular
diameters of all measurable lesions when compared
with pretreatment measurements or the appearance of
new lesions. all radiographic tumour measurements

immunohistochemical study
avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (abc) staining was
used for liver biopsy specimens, as previously described.25
fixed liver specimens were cut into 4 p m sections,
deparafiinized and hydrated. the blocking procedure
for endogenous biotin in hepatic tissue specimens
involved the addition of 0.02% (wh) avidin (cappel,
organon teknika, durham, nc, usa) for lomin,
followed by washing twice for 5 min each time in trisbuffered saline (tbs; 0.6moll, ph7.5), the application of 0.001% (wh) biotin (cappel) incubated for
10 min and then washing twice for 5 min in tbs. to
detect glucocorticoid receptors (gr) in hcc cells, a
monoclonal antibody directed against gr (a gift from
dr okret, karolinska institute, sweden) was used,26
followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg
(vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa). hepatocellular carcinoma cells were viewed with a photomicroscope (olympus, tokyo, japan) and positive gr
status was defined as >lo% hcc cells reacting to the
monoclonal antibody in each tissue section examined.

statistical methods
a two-stage phase i1 experimental design, with 32
patients in stage i and 55 patients in total, was used to
test the null hypothesis that the true response rate was
< 10% versus the alternative hypothesis that the true
response rate was >25%.27if there were fewer than
three responses in the first 32 patients, then the trial
would be terminated and the drug would be rejected as
5 1 0 % active with an a value of 0.05 and a p value of
0.1. survival curves were plotted using the kaplanmeier method.28

results
forty-six patients in all were studied. patient characteristics are shown in table 1 . the median age was 65
years (range 38-81 years). forty-four patients were
male, 34 had hepatitis b and nine had hepatitis c viral
infections. all patients had american joint committee
on cancer stage i11 or iv hcc.29 most patients had
failed on previous therapies and had poor liver function
and were in poor general physical condition.
two patients were lost to follow up and 12 patients
died of hcc before repeat tumour measurements
could be performed. thirty-two patients were able to be
evaluated. twelve (38%) patients had sd and 20 (62%)
patients had pd. seven sd patients had a minor

acetate was 21 months. eight patients were still alive at
15, 15, 17, 19, 19,20,24 and 27 months after therapy.
after  xxxd2557xxx  therapy, 20 of 32 (62%)
patients had an improvement in their appetite and
feeling of well-being. fourteen of 22 (64%) patients
had an increase in lean bodyweight (median 5 kg; range
1-14 kg). four of 32 (13%) patients had an improvement in their performance status. thirteen (40%)
patients had an increase in  xxxg124xxx  (median
0.3gldl; range 0.1-1 gidl). eight of 12 (75%) sd
patients had an improvement in their appetite or feeling
of well-being and a bodyweight gain or an increase in
 xxxg124xxx .
the overall toxicity of  xxxd2557xxx  treatment in
46 patients was mild and tolerable. one patient had
mild congestive cardiac failure, which resolved after
diuretic treatment. one patient had hyperglycaemia,
which resolved after dietary management. nine of 46
(19%) patients developed mild oedema after  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate. there was no thrombo-embolism, hypertension
or peptic ulcer observed in any of the patients. there
were no other symptoms of toxicity.

response, with a median tumour size reduction of 18%.
a-fetoprotein levels were reduced in five of 24 (21%)
patients with a median reduction of 59 ng/ml. one
patient had a reduction of tumour size of 40% with a
reduction in afp of 136 381 ng/ml (from 138 810 to
2429 ng/ml). his inoperable tumour converted to an
operable tumour and he underwent partial hepatectomy
2 months after  xxxd2557xxx  therapy. there was no
significant relationship between sd or pd and age, sex,
cancer stage, performance status, liver function or
metastasis in hcc patients treated with  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate. glucocorticoid receptors in liver biopsy tissue
were assayed in 10 patients. five patients were positive
for gr and four of these patients had sd after
 xxxd2557xxx  therapy. five patients were negative
for gr and all had pd. t h e overall survival times of 46
patients is shown in fig. 1. the overall median survival
time was 4 months (range 1 week to 27 months). the
median survival of patients who had sd after  xxxd2557xxx 

the results of the present study indicate that  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate treatment does not any have significant anticancer effects in the treatment of advanced hcc. the
encouraging results from one earlier report on two pr
in five hcc patients after  xxxd2557xxx  therapy
cannot be repr0d~ced.i~
 xxxd2557xxx  may be
useful in the palliative management of hcc patients. it
is interesting that seven (22%) hcc patients in the
present study had some minor reduction of tumour sue
after  xxxd2557xxx  treatment. one inoperable hcc
patient had a reduction of tumour sue of up to 40%
with a reduction in afp from 138 810 to 2429 ng/ml;
this patient was able to undergo partial hepatectomy.
this suggests that  xxxd2557xxx  may have a minor
anti-cancer effect in some hcc patients, even those
that have failed on all previous therapies. the minor
anti-cancer activity of  xxxd2557xxx  may be related
to the characteristics of certain patients, such as the
presence of gr in tumour cells. this may be important
in the selection of hcc patients for future hormonal
therapy. the dose-response relationship of  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate treatment in hcc is unknown. a study to
investigate the anti-cancer effect of high dose  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate in the treatment of hcc is currently underway
in the veterans general hospital-taipei.
in addition to the reduction in tumour size, another
important end-point of  xxxd2557xxx  treatment of
hcc is the improvement in survival rate. other hormonal therapy, such as tamoxifen, has been reported to
be ineffective in the reduction of the size of hcc but is
effective in the prolongation of survival rates in hcc
patients.20the patients in the present study were mostly
elderly, preterminal advanced hcc patients with various degrees of liver decompensation, poor performance
status, had failed on all previous treatments and were
unsuitable for any other therapy. we expected their
survival to be poor. the reported median survival rates

280
can be as short as 1.6 months in this type of patient.3o
the overall median survival of 4 months in advanced
h c c patients after  xxxd2557xxx  therapy is
encouraging. t h e median survival of 21 months in sd
patients after  xxxd2557xxx  therapy in the present
study is extraordinary because the median survival of
patients with a tumour size > 5 cm after curative
resection is 18 monthsa3whether  xxxd2557xxx  can
prolong the overall survival rate of h c c patients needs
further investigation by prospective randomized clinical
trials. we further suggest that, for future studies, the
duration of  xxxd2557xxx  therapy may be continued
until death of the patient instead of cessation of  xxxd2557xxx  once progressive disease is established.
the majority of patients with advanced hcc have
significant anorexia, weight loss, tiredness and generally
do not have a feeling of well-being. cachexia can be
severe and of rapid onset in h c c patients.31 many
patients in the present study were advanced stage,
preterminal h c c patients and any improvement in the
quality of life was of importantance to them.  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate, in various doses, has been reported to be effective
in the management of anorexia and cachexia in cancer
patient^.^^,^^ a recent dose-response study of  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate in breast cancer patients showed that 160 mg/day
may be optimal for achieving the best quality of life with
fewest side effects.h  xxxd2557xxx  at 160 mg/day was
effective in improving appetite, lean bodyweight, a feeling
of well-being and performance status in patients with
advanced hcc in the present study.  xxxd2557xxx 
may also improve the quality of life in these patients. the
overall toxicity of  xxxd2557xxx  therapy was low and
well-tolerated. therefore,  xxxd2557xxx  therapy may
useful in the palliative management of patients with
advanced hcc.
in conclusion,  xxxd2557xxx  has no significant anticancer effect in the treatment of advanced h c c patients.
 xxxd2557xxx  may be useful in the palliative
management of advanced h c c patients. improvement in
anorexia, cachexia, performance status and a feeling of
well-being can occur in advanced h c c patients after
 xxxd2557xxx  therapy. side effects of therapy with
 xxxd2557xxx  were minimal. occasional patients may
experience a minor reduction in tumour size and a
prolonged survival rate after  xxxd2557xxx  therapy.
this may be related to the presence of gr in hcc.
