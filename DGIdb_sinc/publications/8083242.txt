a model for the  xxxg748xxx  pathway to thrombin

a mathematical simulation of the  xxxg748xxx  pathway to the generation of thrombin has been developed
using a combination of empirical, estimated, and deduced rate constants for reactions involving the activation of factor e,x, v, and viii, in the formation of
thrombin, as well as rate constants for the assembly of
the coagulation enzyme complexes which involve factor
viiia-factor ma (intrinsic tenase) and  xxxg749xxx -xa (prothrornbinase) assembled on phospholipid membrane.
differential equations describing the fate of each species inthe reaction were developed and solved using an
interactive procedure based upon the runge-kutta
technique. in addition to the theoretical considerations
involving the reactions of the  xxxg748xxx  pathway, a
physical constraint associated with the stability of the
 xxxg751xxx -factor ixa complex has been incorporated
into the model based upon the empirical observations
associated with the stability of this complex. the model
system provides a realistic accounting of the fates of
each of the proteins in the coagulation reaction through
a range of initiator (factorviia- xxxg748xxx ) concentrathe modelis responsive
tions ranging from 5 pm to 5
to alterations in the concentrations of factor viii, factor
v, and their respective activated species,  xxxg751xxx 
and  xxxg749xxx , and overall provides a reasonable approximation ofempirical data. the computer modelpermits the assessment of the reaction over a broad range
of conditions and provides a useful tool for the development and management ofreaction studies.

computer-based mathematical model to describe the kineticsof
the  xxxg741xxx  complex (5). this latter model explained
the sensitivity of that system to the concentrationsof various
reactants including the
paradoxical decreases inrates observed
with increasing concentrations of enzyme, substrate, or lipid
surface.
these examples point out the need to identify the different
kinetic fates of the individual proteins initially presentwhen
reacting mixtures are studied.  xxxg741xxx  is an enzyme with
distinctly different catalytic properties in the presence or absence of its active cofactor  xxxg749xxx  (6). both  xxxg741xxx -phospholipid and thrombin can activatefactor v and factor vi11 to
their respectiveactive
cofactors (7-12). factorviiia, once
formed, is subject to spontaneous inactivation (13, 14). factor
ixa is virtually inactive without  xxxg751xxx  (15). factors ix
and x serve as competitive substrates for the tissue factorfactor viia complex (4,16,17), and
 xxxg741xxx -phospholipid catalyzes the formation of factor i x a (4).these complexities make
interpretation of the kinetics of coagulation less than obvious.
the reaction is even more difficult to analyze because of the
absence of steady state conditions. the concentrations of all
substrates, cofactors, and enzymes change throughout the reaction, and enzymelactivator concentrations may and
do exceed
substrate concentrations. in addition, the natural concentrations of the coagulation proteins in blood vary over an extremely broad range.
in this studywe model the procoagulant reactions using the
runge-kutta digital integration technique (18).in previously
reported work, lewis et al. (19) used a similar algorithm to
successfully model the assembly of fibrin.

very small time intervals require more computing time but decrease
the possibility of generating artifactual results due to approximating
linear interpolations between intervals when nonlinear events are taking place. in order to avoid these types of artifacts, the model was

under the conditions used by lawson et al. (11, sufficient lipid was
added to saturate all protein-lipid binding reaction conditions; therefore, lipid binding equilibria are not included as reaction steps per se.
thus, in thismodel as well as the experiments describedin lawson et
al. (l),the kinetic significance of the phospholipid concentration is
reduced by performing each experiment with vast excesses
of phospholipid. therefore, these mathematicalmodels do not, at present, include
a factor for the concentration of lipid.

from the empirical data of lawson et al. (11, it is clearly established
that there isa decay in the activity of the  xxxg751xxx -factor m a complex with time.

factor is used in determining the changing concentration of the  xxxg751xxx -factor ma complex
(equation 7).
in order to execute the model, it is necessary to provide the starting
concentrations and estimates of the kinetic constants appropriate for
each reaction system. for most simulations described in thispaper, the
initial concentrations are identical with thoseused in theexperimental
conditions of lawson et al. (1) at 5 nm factor viia- xxxg748xxx  unless
specified otherwise.
table i lists the empirical, estimated, and deduced rate constants
used in thesimulated models. k,,, k,,, k,,, andk,, are taken
directly from
previously published values (15,21,22). each of these studies reported
k,, and k , values for the reactions. for the purposes of this model, the
k,, for each of the reactions (k,) was assumed to be rapid and the k ,
values (k,,, k,,, k,,, and k1j were calculated from the michaelis-menten
relationship. the kinetics of factor v activation ( k , , k , )were described
by monkovicand tracy (23),and theactivation of factor vi11 (k,, k,)were
initially approximated by analogy and refined by comparison with the
experimental results of lawson et al. (1).it isknown that thekd values
for the  xxxg749xxx - xxxg741xxx  complexand  xxxg751xxx -factor ma complex
are on the order of 1-2 n~(15,241, and theratio of the on and off rates
(k&, and kdk,) are consistent withthose studies. the actual on-ratefor
the  xxxg741xxx  complex formation from lipid-bound proteins has
been reported by krishnaswamy et al. (3), and the value for k , (and by
analogy, k , ) reflects that study. the accelerated conversion of  xxxg752xxx 
to factor ma shows complex kinetics in thepresence of  xxxg741xxx  and the
 xxxg748xxx -factor viia complex. a previous study by lawson et al. (4)
reported the resultsof experiments in which factor m was activated to
factor k a p by factor viia- xxxg748xxx  in thepresence of  xxxg741xxx . that
report included data showing the changing rate as theconcentration of
substrate was depleted. from those data, a rough estimation of a second
order rate constant (k,,) was calculated for the present study. the rates
for meizothrombin conversion to a-thrombin (k,) and the decay rate for
 xxxg751xxx  (a combination of k,, and z as described above) were determined by matching results of the computer model with experimental
results reported by lawson et al. (1).
the rate constants for activation of factor v, k, and k,, were adjusted
from the published rate constants by factors of 2 to 3. this adjustment
was necessary to match the empirical results of lawson et al. (1). the
different reaction conditions under which the data of the laboratories
were obtained may explain the small difference between the experimentally derived constants and those used in thismodel. similarly, the rate
constants for activation of factor vi11 were determined by fitting model
results to those observed by lawson et al. (1).
the results of each simulation are a set of reactant concentrations
predicted for each time interval selected which can be converted to a
graphical form by assigning relative specific activities for each species.
the graphical representations for thrombin activity correspond to the
experimental observation of thrombin activity as influenced by the differing activity of a-thrombin and meizothrombin. the activity of meizothrombin is known to be about 120%that of a-thrombin (25); therefore,
a relative specific activity of 1.2 is assigned to meizothrombin and 1to
a-thrombin in order to model thrombin activity in experimental results.
in all other cases, a relative specific activity coefficient of 1 is assigned
to the species of interest.

results

fig. la shows the rate of thrombin formation predicted by
the model at 5 pm factor viia- xxxg748xxx  complex (open
circles),together with theempirical results obtained under the
same conditions (open squares). the similarity in the form of
the predicted reaction course to the empirical data is encouraging. the form of the reaction profile, characterized by a lag or
initiation phase, a propagation phase, and thedecay of meizothrombin to a-thrombin (theobserved “bump” in activity) seen
between 140 and 180 s, does not prove the model, nor does it
validate thatall of the assumptionsupon which it was built are
correct. however, the result suggests the
model provides a reasonable approximation of the empirical result. the slight differences between the empirical result and themodel are easily
reconciled if one considers the many varied conditions under
which the empirical rate constants used were derived and appreciates the difficulty in obtaining precise laboratory results
in a reaction system as complex as the extrinsic pathway. the
many different laboratory determinations of the empirical rate
constants which are used in the model were collected under
different conditions of temperature, metalion and protein and
lipid concentration. each of these variables is known to have
significant effects upon reaction rates. for our empirical results (l), different experiments conducted on different days
using different protein preparations produced similar relative
results but with the lagperiods often varying as much as the
difference between the model and the displayed results.

having the greatest influence on the initiation phase of the
reaction which precedesthe phaseof maximal thrombinformation. fig. 4 presents thepredicted progress curves for thrombin
generation when the reaction is initiated at different tissue
factor-factor viia concentrations. the data of fig. 4 illustrate
the same form of dependence on the initiating tissue factorfactor viia concentration observed for the empirical results of
of
lawson et al. (1).the empirical studies using concentrations
the activatorcomplex which varied over a 1000-fold range produced only a 5-fold change in the observed propagation phase
rate of thrombin generation; the major effect observed was a
prolongation of the “lag”or initiation phaseof the reaction. virtually the same observations are made
for the computermodel
over a 1000-fold range of activator complex concentration.
theeffect of factor vzzz on the reaction progress-it is
known that factor vi11 plays a critical role in the initiation of
coagulation, and that, in the absence of factor viii, the activated partial thromboplastin time
(21) is extended. in contrast,
factor vi11 deficiency does not result in prolongation of the
prothrombin time(22). while the tissuefactor-factor viia comof factor
plex is important informing the initial concentrations
xa required for thrombin generation to proceed, the contribution of the  xxxg751xxx -factor 1% complex can be shown in the
model by setting the initial concentration of factor vi11 to 0.
fig. 5a shows that when low  xxxg748xxx -factor viia concentrations are used, the thrombinformation rate is depressedas
a consequence of the much slower rate of  xxxg741xxx  formation.
this prediction by the model is virtually identical with the
observation made in theempirical studies of lawson et al. (1)
which show that at low (picomolar)  xxxg748xxx -factor viia
concentrations, thepropagation phase of thrombin generation
is significantly depressed when factor vi11 is left out of the
initial reaction mixture.
similarly, both the model and the data of lawson et al. (1)
show that at hightissue factor-factor viiaconcentrations,
omitting factor vi11 from the reaction mixture has a minimal
effect on the time course or form of the a-thrombin generation
curve. fig. 5b shows the predicted a-thrombin generation rate
at 1n m  xxxg748xxx -factor viia. the ratesof thrombin generation are identical whether factor vi11 is present or not. thus,
the presence of factor vi11 is not critical t o achieve rapid maximal formation of thrombin when high levels of factor viia-

a difficulty inherent in many kinetic studiesis the reliance
upon steady state kineticsfor the determination of individual
rate constants. in theprocess of the activationof prothrombin
to a-thrombin under pseudophysiological conditions of procoagulants, the concentrations of each zymogen, enzyme, procofactor, cofactor, and substrate vary widely and change significantly. for this reason,it is not obvious how the full

 xxxg748xxx -factor viiaand for  xxxg751xxx -factorma complex
becomes the determining basisof the physiologically necessary
concentrations of  xxxg752xxx  and  xxxg741xxx .
the results of the empirical data of lawson et al. (11, which
have been incorporated into the
model, indicate that something
is causing thefactor viiia-factor ixa complex-related activity
in theexpression of  xxxg741xxx  t o be diminished after the initial,
essential formation of some  xxxg751xxx -factor ma complex.
one plausible contributor to this
loss of activity is thedissociation of the subunits of  xxxg751xxx  (13) or theproteolytic inactivation of  xxxg751xxx  by factor ma (14).another possible
explanation is proteolytic inactivation of either  xxxg751xxx  or
factor ma under theconditions in which a vast excess of thrombin concentration occurs. for the purposes of the model, a
mathematical relationship was introduced which results in a
decay of the  xxxg751xxx -factor ma complex, but only after the
3 pm complex is formed and a steady state level of 3 pm is
maintained. the actuallevel of active complex can be approximated from empirical results of the rateof formation of factor
xa. in the experimental results reported by lawson et al. (l),
the results suggestthat there is never more than a 5 pm active
 xxxg751xxx -factor ixa complex, however, from the standpoint
of either themodel system or the
empirical data, the high
levels
of  xxxg741xxx , which would occur if a stable factor viii-factorixa
complex was present, would not substantially influence the
ultimate maximum rate of thrombin generation seen during
the propagation phase
of the reaction. this lack of contribution
would occur because the increase in  xxxg741xxx  levels, which
would occur with a stable factorviiia-factor ma complex,
would be formed subsequent to the maximum rate
of thrombin
generation; i.e. the propagation phase.
reviewing the model results suggests the
following sequence
of events in the formation of thrombin. 1) the tissue factorfactor viia complex (5 pm) causes the activation
of  xxxg752xxx  and
 xxxg741xxx  at the rates of 0.5 pm s-' and 1 pm s-', respectively. 2)
the  xxxg741xxx  formed is then able to initiate the
conversion of
factor v to  xxxg749xxx . 3) the  xxxg749xxx  formed then complexes
with  xxxg741xxx  to form the  xxxg741xxx  complex which begins theconversion of prothrombin t o thrombin (via the meizothrombin intermediate). 4) the resulting thrombinformed accelerates the rate
of factor vactivation and together with
factor
xa results in the conversion of factor vi11 t o  xxxg751xxx . 5)
with  xxxg751xxx  present, the enzymatic activity
of factor ixa

is enhanced resulting a in
it is at this point that the initiation phase of the reaction is
complete. 6 ) from the experimental results, at 30 s, the concentration of factor ma is still less than20 pm;the concentration of  xxxg741xxx  is also less than 100 pm, but beginning to
increase because of the additionalconversion of factor xby the
small but significant concentration of the  xxxg751xxx -factor
ixa complex. the concentration of thrombin is also low at this
time, but increasing
because of the newly formingprothrombinuse complex. by 60 s, the concentrationof factors va and viiia
have reached levels easily saturating their respective apoenzymes ( xxxg741xxx  and factor ixa, respectively), ultimately leading to maximal ratesof  xxxg741xxx  and thrombin formation.
an analysis of the simulationmodel shows that theobservations of activation of individual factors and cofactors are consistent with earlier work on the protein activationpathway. at
the start of the propagation phase of thrombin formation, the

23373

amount ofprothrombinase necessary to generate the thrombin
(fig. 1)is equal to the concentration
of  xxxg741xxx  formed. factor
va, which is probably formed by both  xxxg741xxx  and thrombin,
appears at a rate which saturates  xxxg741xxx  at the end of the
initiation phase.
the most important conclusion from these experiments is
that there isno need for any enhanced rate
of activation of any
of the components of the extrinsicpathway. the formation rate
of factor ixa observed empirically is sufficient to generate a
significant concentration of the  xxxg751xxx -factorma complex,
and the resulting formation of  xxxg741xxx  allows for enough
prothrornbinase t o rapidly convert prothrombin t o thrombin.
we anticipate that the computer
models which are identified in
this paper will have utility in exploring the influence of alterations in the concentrationsof any species in the coagulation
reaction and alsohow alterations in theirconcentrations, as a
consequence of the presence of either natural or synthetic inhibitors of the coagulation reaction system, will influence outcome. the efficiency of the computer explorations in terms of
time spent, materials required, andpersonnel cost makes it a
valuable tool for the exploration of research concepts, the
identification of appropriate experimental conditions for empirical exploration, and for development of model-generated
hypotheses.
