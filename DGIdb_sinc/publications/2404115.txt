 xxxd1806xxx . a synthetic steroid with diverse biologic effects.   xxxd1806xxx  ( xxxd1806xxx ) is a synthetic steroid with multiple and diverse biologic effects. it exerts these effects by binding to steroid transport proteins in the circulation and to specific receptors in target tissues. centrally,  xxxd1806xxx  inhibits gonadotropins, suppressing gametogenesis and steroidogenesis. gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis are suppressed further through  xxxd1806xxx 's direct effect on specific enzyme systems.  xxxd1806xxx  also displays immunoregulatory effects both in vivo and in vitro. in endometriosis,  xxxd1806xxx  induces amenorrhea and a hypoestrogenic state, resulting in endometrial atrophy. the drug's direct binding to androgen and progesterone receptors in endometriotic tissue may contribute further to the suppression of endometriosis. in women with endometriosis who produce autoantibodies against endometrial cells and endometrial cell-derived phospholipids, histones and nucleotides,  xxxd1806xxx  may improve reproductive performance through the suppression of abnormal autoantibody levels. in several other autoimmune and genetic disorders  xxxd1806xxx  brings about a clinical improvement by lowering abnormal autoantibody production or by increasing the concentration of genetically deficient protein. in order to explore the full clinical potential of the drug and to better understand  xxxd1806xxx 's mechanism of action and especially its immunoregulatory effects in autoimmune diseases and endometriosis, further investigation is necessary.
