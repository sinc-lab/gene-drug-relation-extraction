1 vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses may be involved in the therapeutic action
of acutely acting  xxxd2022xxx  agents, including the triptans and ergot alkaloids. while 5-ht1b/1d
receptors mediate the eect of triptans, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine also interact with aadrenoceptors. in the present study, we investigated the potential role of a1- and a2-adrenoceptors in
mediating vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs.
2 ten minute intracarotid infusions of phenylephrine (1, 3 and 10 mg kg71 min71) or bht 933 (3,
10 and 30 mg kg71 min71) produced dose-dependent decreases in total carotid and arteriovenous
anastomotic conductances; no changes were observed in the capillary fraction.
3 the carotid vascular eects of phenylephrine and bht 933 were selectively abolished by
 xxxd3000xxx  (100 mg kg71, i.v.) and rauwolscine (300 mg kg71, i.v.), respectively. the responses to
phenylephrine and bht 933 were not aected by the selective 5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist
gr127935 (500 mg kg71, i.v.).
4 these results show that both a1- and a2-adrenoceptors can mediate vasoconstriction of carotid
arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs. since vasoconstrictor activity in this in vivo model
is predictive of anti-migraine activity, an agonist activity at particularly the a2-adrenoceptor
subtypes, in view of their less ubiquitous nature, could provide migraine abortive potential. thus,
the present results may aid further understanding of the mode of action of some current  xxxd2022xxx  agents and may eventually be helpful in the development of future treatment in migraine.

introduction
vasodilatation of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses may be
involved in the pathophysiology of migraine headache (heyck,
1969; saxena, 1995). in line with this proposal, it has
previously been shown that several acutely acting  xxxd2022xxx  agents, including the ergots (ergotamine and
dihydroergotamine) and triptans, potently vasoconstrict
porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses predominantly via
5-ht1b/1d receptors (de vries et al., 1999; villaloân et al., 1999).
interestingly, the carotid vasoconstrictor eect of ergot
alkaloids involves, in addition to 5-ht1b/1d receptors,
unidenti®ed receptor mechanisms (de vries et al., 1998,
1999). since the ergot derivatives display high anity at aadrenoceptors (leysen, 1985), their therapeutic ecacy may be
partly explained by an action mediated via these receptors.
indeed, we recently reported that canine external carotid
vasoconstriction by ergot alkaloids also involves a-adrenoceptors (villaloân et al., 1999). in this context, the possible
involvement of a-adrenoceptors in the porcine carotid

vasculature has been hampered, mainly on the basis that
porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses were described to
be insensitive to sympathetic nerve stimulation or intracarotid
infusions of noradrenaline (verdouw et al., 1984). this
discrepancy is striking since in conscious pigs arteriovenous
anastomoses are under a vasoconstrictor sympathetic tone
(hales, 1974; van woerkens et al., 1990; den boer et al.,
1993). in fact, sympathetic nerve stimulation as well as
exogenously administered noradrenaline causes a-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction of arteriovenous anastomoses in
the hind limb of several species (folkow & sivertsson, 1964;
spence et al., 1972; hales, 1974; baker et al., 1978; hales et al.,
1982).
in the light of the above, the present study was designed to
investigate the potential role of a1- and a2-adrenoceptors in the
vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in
anaesthetized pigs. for this purpose, we made use of the
selective agonists, phenylephrine (a1) and bht 933 (6-ethyl5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-4h-oxazolo[4,5-d]azepin-2 xxxd2850xxx  dihydrochloride; (a2), and the selective antagonists,  xxxd3000xxx  (a1),
rauwolscine (a2) (see ruolo et al., 1991; piascik et al., 1996),

in a well-de®ned in vivo model predictive of anti-migraine
activity (saxena, 1995; de vries et al., 1999). in addition,
gr127935 (n-[methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl]-2'methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) [1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide was used to exclude the possible role of 5-ht1b/1d
receptors (clitherow et al., 1994; de vries et al., 1996; skingle
et al., 1996). the results obtained may provide useful
information concerning the mode of action of some currently
used anti-migraine agents and, possibly, new avenues for the
development of anti-migraine agents.

methods
general
after an overnight fast, 40 domestic pigs (yorkshire6landrace; 10 ± 14 kg) were anaesthetized with azaperone (120 mg,
i.m.), midazolam hydrochloride (5 mg, i.m.) and sodium
pentobarbitone (600 mg, i.v.). after tracheal intubation, the
animals were connected to a respirator (bear 2e, bemeds
ag, baar, switzerland) for intermittent positive pressure
ventilation with a mixture of room air and oxygen. respiratory
rate, tidal volume and oxygen supply were adjusted to keep
arterial blood gas values within physiological limits (ph:
7.35 ± 7.48; pco2: 35 ± 48 mmhg; po2: 100 ± 120 mmhg).
anaesthesia was maintained with a continuous i.v. infusion
of sodium pentobarbitone (20 mg kg71 h71). it may be
pointed out that this anaesthetic regimen, together with
bilateral vagosympathectomy (see below), leads to an increase
in heart rate and vasodilatation of arteriovenous anastomoses
due to a loss of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone,
respectively. indeed, basal arteriovenous anastomotic blood
¯ow is considerably higher in sodium pentobarbitoneanaesthetized pigs (70 ± 80% of carotid blood ¯ow) than in
those under fentanyl/thiopental anaesthesia (*19% of carotid
blood ¯ow) (den boer et al., 1993). a high basal carotid
arteriovenous anastomotic ¯ow is particularly useful for
investigating the eects of drugs that vasoconstrict arteriovenous anastomoses.
a catheter was placed in the inferior vena cava via the left
femoral vein for infusion of antagonists and sodium
pentobarbitone. another catheter was placed in the aortic
arch via the left femoral artery for the measurement of arterial
blood pressure (combitrans disposable pressure transducer;
braun, melsungen, germany) and arterial blood withdrawal
for the measurement of blood gases (abl-510; radiometer,
copenhagen, denmark). subsequently, the right common
carotid artery and the external jugular vein were dissected
free and the accompanying vagosympathetic trunks were cut
between two ligatures in order to prevent a possible in¯uence
via baroreceptor re¯exes on agonist-induced carotid vascular
responses. the right external jugular vein was catheterized for
withdrawal of venous blood samples for determining blood
gases (abl-510; radiometer, copenhagen, denmark). two
hub-less needles, each connected to a polyethylene tube, were
inserted into the right common carotid artery and used for
agonist (phenylephrine or bht 933) infusion and radioactive
microspheres injection, respectively. the microspheres were
injected against the direction of blood ¯ow for uniform mixing.
blood ¯ow was measured in the right common carotid
artery with a ¯ow probe (internal diameter: 2.5 mm) connected
to a sine-wave electromagnetic ¯ow meter (trans¯ow 601system, skalar, delft, the netherlands). heart rate was
measured with a tachograph (crw, erasmus university,
rotterdam, the netherlands) triggered by electrocardiogram

a-adrenoceptor subtypes and porcine carotid avas

signals. arterial blood pressure, heart rate and right common
carotid blood ¯ow were continuously monitored on a
polygraph (crw, erasmus university, rotterdam, the
netherlands). during the experiment, body temperature was
kept around 378c and the animal was continuously infused
with saline to compensate for ¯uid loss.

distribution of carotid blood ¯ow
the distribution of common carotid blood ¯ow was
determined with 15.5+0.1 mm (s.d.) diameter microspheres
labelled with 141ce, 113sn, 103ru, 95nb or 46sc (nen dupont,
boston, u.s.a.). for each measurement, about 200,000
microspheres, labelled with one of the radioisotopes, were
mixed and injected into the right common carotid artery. at
the end of the experiment, the animal was killed by an
overdose of sodium pentobarbitone and the heart, lungs,
kidneys and all ipsilateral cranial tissues were dissected out,
weighed and put in vials. the radioactivity in these vials was
counted for 10 min in a g-scintillation counter (packard,
minaxi autogamma 5000), using suitable windows to
discriminate the dierent isotopes (141ce: 120 ± 167, kev,
113
sn: 355 ± 435 kev, 103ru: 450 ± 548 kev, 95nb: 706 ± 829
kev and 46sc: 830 ± 965 kev). all data were processed by a set
of specially designed programs (saxena et al., 1980). the
fraction of carotid blood ¯ow distributed to the dierent
tissues was calculated by multiplying the ratio of tissue and
total radioactivity of each radioisotope by the total common
carotid blood ¯ow at the time of the injection of the
microspheres labelled with the respective isotope. since little
or no radioactivity was detected in the heart and kidneys, all
microspheres trapped in lungs reached this tissue from the
venous side after escaping via carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. therefore, the amount of radioactivity in the lungs was
used as an index of the arteriovenous anastomotic fraction of
the common carotid blood ¯ow (saxena & verdouw, 1982).
vascular conductance (1072 ml min71 mmhg71) was calculated by dividing blood ¯ow (ml min71) by blood pressure
(mmhg), multiplied by hundred.

experimental protocol
after a stabilization period of about 60 min, baseline values of
heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, common carotid
blood ¯ow and its distribution, as well as arterial and jugular
venous blood gases were measured. thereafter, the animals
were divided into four groups receiving i.v. infusions
(0.5 ml min71 for 10 min) of either distilled water (vehicle;
n=14),  xxxd3000xxx  (100 mg kg71; n=10), rauwolscine
(300 mg kg71; n=10) or gr127935 (500 mg kg71; n=6). after
a waiting period of 15 min, all variables were reassessed.
subsequently, each group was divided into two subgroups
receiving 10-min intracarotid infusions (0.1 ml min71) of
phenylephrine (cumulative doses: 1, 3, and 10 mg kg71 min71)
or bht 933 (cumulative doses: 3, 10 and 30 mg kg71 min71).
the number of animals in the dierent groups receiving
phenylephrine and bht 933 infusions were: vehicle (n=7
each),  xxxd3000xxx  (n=7 and 3, respectively), rauwolscine (n=3
and 7, respectively) and gr127935 (n=3 each). all variables
were collated again 10 min after the start of each agonist
infusion.
it may be pointed out here that gr127935, which is a
potent and selective 5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist (clitherow
et al., 1994; de vries et al., 1996; skingle et al., 1996), was
used to rule out the remote possibility that the eects of
phenylephrine and/or bht 933 were mediated via 5-ht1b/1d

e.w. willems et al

receptors. the eectiveness of the blockade of 5-ht1b/1d
receptors by gr127935 was con®rmed by evaluating
decreases in the total carotid blood ¯ow and conductance
by sumatriptan (de vries et al., 1996). sumatriptan (30, 100
and 300 mg kg71, i.v.; every 10 min over a period of 5 min
each) was administered in animals treated with gr127935
after a near complete recovery from the eects of the last
dose of phenylephrine or bht 933 had been achieved
(*90 min).

data presentation and statistical analysis
all data have been expressed as the mean+s.e.mean. the per
cent changes from baseline (i.e. after treatment with vehicle,
 xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine and gr127935) values caused by the
dierent doses of phenylephrine or bht 933 within each group
of animals were calculated. a two-way repeated measures
anova with bonferroni's correction (sigmastat 1.0, jandel
corporation, chicago, il, u.s.a.) was used to establish
whether these changes were statistically signi®cant (p50.05,
two-tailed) when compared with the baseline in each group as
well as with the corresponding agonist dose in the vehicletreated group.

drugs
apart from the anaesthetics azaperone (stresnil1; janssen
pharmaceuticals, beerse, belgium), midazolam hydrochloride
(dormicum1; homann la roche b.v., mijdrecht, the
netherlands) and sodium pentobarbitone (apharmo, arnhem,
the netherlands), the compounds used in this study were:
 xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride (bufa chemie b.v., castricum; the
netherlands), gr127935,  xxxd3263xxx  (both from
glaxowellcome, ware, herts, u.k.; courtesy: dr h.e.
connor), phenylephrine hydrochloride, bht 933 and rauwolscine dihydrochloride (all from sigma-aldrich chemie b.v.,
zwijndrecht, the netherlands). finally,  xxxd2267xxx  (leo
pharmaceutical products, weesp, the netherlands) was used
to prevent clotting of blood in the catheters. all drugs were
dissolved in distilled water. for  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine and
gr127935 a short period of heating was needed. the doses of
the drugs refer to their respective salts.

results
systemic and carotid haemodynamic eects of vehicle,
 xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine and gr127935
as shown in table 1, the administration of vehicle (5 ml of
distilled water) did not produce any change in systemic or
carotid haemodynamic variables. on the other hand,
 xxxd3000xxx  (100 mg kg71, i.v.), rauwolscine (300 mg kg71, i.v.)
and gr127935 (500 mg kg71, i.v.) decreased mean arterial
blood pressure by 7+2, 9+3 and 13+2%, respectively,
which only in the case of rauwolscine was accompanied by
a signi®cant decrease in arteriovenous anastomotic blood
¯ow by 18+5%. additionally, rauwolscine increased
capillary blood ¯ow and conductance by 24+7% and
38+9%, respectively. these eects of rauwolscine were
noticed in several tissues (ear, skin, muscle, bones, salivary
gland, fat and tongue; data not shown). no other
signi®cant changes were noticed with  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine
or gr127935.

systemic haemodynamic changes by phenylephrine and
bht 933
systemic haemodynamic variables measured before and after
the two agonists in animals treated with vehicle,  xxxd3000xxx ,
rauwolscine or gr127935 are shown in table 2. in animals
treated with vehicle, phenylephrine elicited an immediate and
dose-dependent increase in heart rate by up to 29+6%. this
increase was not aected by treatment with  xxxd3000xxx ,
rauwolscine or gr127935. bht 933 did not cause any change
in heart rate. moreover, no changes in mean arterial blood
pressure were observed after infusions of phenylephrine or
bht 933.
in vehicle-treated animals, both phenylephrine and bht
933 showed a trend to increase the dierence between arterial
and jugular venous oxygen saturation (a-vso2) by up to
1036+325 and 254+140%, respectively (table 2). however,
statistical signi®cance was achieved only with the highest dose
of phenylephrine. the phenylephrine-induced response was
selectively antagonized by treatment with  xxxd3000xxx .

after infusions of phenylephrine and bht 933 in the four
groups of animals treated with vehicle,  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine
or gr127935 are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively. in
vehicle-treated animals, both phenylephrine and bht 933
caused dose-dependent decreases in total carotid conductance
(maximum change: 74+4 and 59+4%, respectively). these
decreases were solely due to changes in arteriovenous
anastomotic conductances, since capillary (nutrient) vascular
conductance remained unchanged. phenylephrine-induced
changes were absent in animals treated with  xxxd3000xxx , but not
in those treated with rauwolscine or gr127935 (figure 1). on
the contrary, bht 933-induced eects were absent in animals
treated with rauwolscine, but not in those treated with
 xxxd3000xxx  or gr127935 (figure 2).
in figure 3 per cent changes (from baseline) observed with
phenylephrine and bht 933 in carotid arteriovenous
anastomotic conductance have been compared in the four
groups of animals. it is clearly shown that  xxxd3000xxx  and

a-adrenoceptor subtypes and porcine carotid avas

rauwolscine selectively blocked the decreases in carotid
arteriovenous anastomotic conductance induced by, respectively, phenylephrine and bht 933. the responses to the two
agonists were not aected in animals treated with the potent
and selective 5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist gr127935.
figure 4 shows the eects of phenylephrine and bht 933
on tissue vascular conductances in animals treated with
vehicle. neither phenylephrine nor bht 933 induced any
change in vascular conductance in the ear, skin, salivary gland,
fat and tongue. on the other hand, phenylephrine decreased
vascular conductance in bone, eye and dura mater. these
phenylephrine-induced conductance decreases were absent in
animals treated with  xxxd3000xxx  (data not shown). in vehicletreated animals (figure 4), but not in rauwolscine-treated
animals (data not shown), bht 933 increased muscle and
brain vascular conductances. the responses to the two agonists
were similar in gr127935-treated animals as in animals
treated with vehicle (data not shown).

e.w. willems et al

since in the present experiments mean arterial blood pressure
was not aected by intracarotid infusion phenylephrine or bht

vascular conductances were qualitatively and quantitatively
similar to those observed in blood ¯ow (data not shown).

carotid vascular responses to sumatriptan in animals

as reported earlier (de vries et al., 1996), sumatriptan (30, 100
and 300 mg kg71, i.v.) did not decrease either total carotid

blood ¯ow (% changes: 74+3, 75+3 and 76+3,
respectively) or conductance (% changes: 8+4, 5+4 and
3+3, respectively) in animals treated with gr127935. in
several previous publications from our laboratory (for
references, see de vries et al., 1998), we have shown that
these doses of sumatriptan consistently cause dose-dependent
decreases in the total carotid conductance. for example, the
changes in the carotid vascular conductance reported by de
vries (1996) with 30, 100 and 300 mg kg71, i.v. of sumatriptan
in vehicle-treated pigs (n=5) were 722+4, 742+5 and
749+7, respectively.

discussion
general
several in vitro studies show that both a1- and a2-adrenoceptors
mediate vascular eects in carotid vessels, including those of the
dog (kawai et al., 1988) and pig (ohgushi et al., 1993).
nevertheless, very few studies have investigated whether these
receptors are operative in the carotid circulation in vivo.
verdouw et al. (1984) reported that intracarotid bolus injections
of noradrenaline elicited short-lasting and phentolaminesensitive decreases in carotid and arteriovenous anastomotic
conductance in pigs, whereas intracarotid infusions of

noradrenaline were devoid of carotid vasoconstriction. notwithstanding, the mechanisms involved in this response to
noradrenaline were not further analysed, particularly in terms
of dierent subtypes of a-adrenoceptors. apart from the
implications discussed below, the present study clearly shows
that both a1- and a2-adrenoceptors can mediate vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in anaesthetized pigs.

systemic and carotid haemodynamic eects of vehicle,
 xxxd3000xxx  and rauwolscine
 xxxd3000xxx  and rauwolscine produced moderate decreases in
mean arterial blood pressure, most likely due to their blocking

e.w. willems et al

properties at, respectively, a1- and a2-adrenoceptors (massingham & hayden, 1975; homan & lefkowitz, 1996; terroân et
al., 1996). importantly, no changes in carotid or arteriovenous
anastomotic conductance were observed after treatment with
 xxxd3000xxx  or rauwolscine. this observation seems to contradict
the results of den boer et al. (1993), who reported that
 xxxd3000xxx  causes a potent vasodilatation of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. however, in contrast to their study where
fentanyl/thiopentane was employed as anaesthetic, we used
sodium pentobarbitone, which attenuates sympathetic tone
and potently vasodilates carotid arteriovenous anastomoses
(see also the method section). interestingly, rauwolscine, but
not  xxxd3000xxx , increased capillary conductance, which was
noticed in the ear, skin, muscle, bones, salivary gland, fat and
tongue. although we do not have a clear explanation, it may
be that a2-adrenoceptors mainly maintain vascular tone in
these cranial tissues. alternatively, rauwolscine may have
activated 5-ht1b/1d receptors, at which the compound displays
partial agonist property (shimamoto et al., 1993). 5-ht1b/1d
receptors can indeed mediate vasodilatation in porcine
coronary arteries (schoeter & hoyer, 1990) and cranial
tissues (de vries et al., 1996).

systemic haemodynamic eects of phenylephrine and
bht 933
no changes in blood pressure or heart rate were observed after
bht 933. in contrast, phenylephrine produced a moderate
increase in heart rate, which remained essentially unchanged in
animals treated with  xxxd3000xxx , rauwolscine or gr127935.
since this tachycardia was absent after propranolol
(500 mg kg71, i.v., n=3; unpublished observations), it would
appear that phenylephrine has a direct action at cardiac badrenoceptors, as shown earlier (bassett et al., 1968).

carotid haemodynamic changes: role of a1- and
a2-adrenoceptors
intracarotid infusions of phenylephrine and bht 933 dosedependently decreased total carotid conductance, which in
both cases was exclusively caused by vasoconstriction of
carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. consistent with the
closure of arteriovenous anastomoses (saxena, 1987), both
phenylephrine and bht 933 showed a trend towards
increasing a-vso2; this was however only signi®cant after
phenylephrine. the activity of the above agonists implies, but
does not categorically prove, that a1- and a2-adrenoceptors are
involved.
the involvement of a1-adrenoceptors in the vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses is strengthened by
the ®nding that  xxxd3000xxx  completely blocked the eects of
phenylephrine. it should be noted that in the dose employed
 xxxd3000xxx  acted selectively at a1-adrenoceptors, since the drug
did not modify bht 933-induced carotid vasoconstriction. a1adrenoceptors also mediate vasoconstriction within the canine
external carotid vascular bed (terroân et al., 1996) and seem to
maintain vascular tone in porcine carotid arteriovenous
anastomoses (den boer et al., 1993). on similar grounds, the
fact that rauwolscine completely antagonized bht 933induced responses indicates that a2-adrenoceptors also mediate
carotid arteriovenous anastomotic vasoconstriction. this
conclusion is substantiated by previous results demonstrating
that clonidine vasoconstricts porcine carotid arteriovenous
anastomoses (verdouw et al., 1984) and that a2-adrenoceptors
partly mediate canine external carotid vasoconstriction by
ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (villaloân et al., 1999).

furthermore,  xxxd3000xxx  selectively attenuated the phenylephrine-induced increases in a-vso2.
taken together, the results of the present study clearly show
that activation of both a1- and a2-adrenoceptors results in a
vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. interestingly, our results seem in contradiction with earlier
experiments in pigs, where intracarotid infusions of noradrenaline did not induce carotid vasoconstriction, but rather
increased total carotid and arteriovenous anastomotic blood
¯ow (verdouw et al., 1984). the suggestion that the absence of
noradrenaline-induced vasoconstrictor eect was due to the
putative a1-blocking properties of the anaesthetic azaperone
(den boer et al., 1993) seems not to be the case, as we used
similar anaesthetic regimen as verdouw et al. (1984). a more
likely explanation could be that noradrenaline, when continuously and slowly infused, also induces a b-adrenoceptormediated vasodilator eect in the carotid circulation, which
negates carotid vasoconstriction. interestingly, cohen &
coman (1981) have provided evidence for the presence of
b-adrenergic vasodilator mechanism in human digital arteriovenous shunts.

possible interactions of phenylephrine and bht 933 with
5-ht1b/1d receptors
as pointed out earlier, 5-ht1b/1d receptors mediate the potent
and selective vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous
anastomoses caused by acutely acting anti-migraine drugs in
the pig (for references, see saxena, 1995; de vries et al., 1999).
one could therefore argue that a part of the phenylephrineand/or bht 933-induced carotid vasoconstriction might also
involve 5-ht1b/1d receptors. this possibility can however be
discounted as treatment of the animals with the potent and
selective 5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist gr127935 (clitherow
et al., 1994; pauwels, 1996; skingle et al., 1996) did not modify
carotid vascular haemodynamic changes induced by either
phenylephrine or bht 933 (see figures 1 ± 3).
importantly, the dose of gr127935 used in this study
(500 mg kg71, i.v.) completely blocks sumatriptan-induced
decreases in total carotid (and arteriovenous anastomotic)
blood ¯ow and conductance (de vries et al., 1996). this was
apparently also the case in our present experiments where no
changes in total carotid blood ¯ow and conductance were
observed with sumatriptan in animals treated with gr127935.
from these data we can exclude the possibility that 5-ht1b/1d
receptors play a role in the phenylephrine- or bht 933induced vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses
in anaesthetized pigs.

eects of phenylephrine and bht 933 on cranial tissue
conductances
although the eects of a-adrenoceptor stimulation have been
extensively studied on isolated blood vessels, the use of
intracarotid injection of radiolabelled microspheres allowed
us to study these eects in the dierent cranial tissues in vivo.
stimulation of  xxxd3000xxx -sensitive a1-adrenoceptors resulted in
vasoconstriction in bones, dura mater and, to a lesser extent, in
the eye, whereas bht 933 was devoid of tissue vasoconstrictor
eects. in fact, bht 933 produced vasodilatation in brain
vasculature, as also reported after clonidine (verdouw et al.,
1984). this may be due to an interaction with endothelial
vasodilator a2-adrenoceptors as previously reported in other
blood vessels (miller & vanhoutte, 1985; angus et al., 1986;
ohgushi et al., 1993). indeed, the increase in brain vascular
conductance was absent in the rauwolscine-treated group.

possible clinical implications
lastly, we would like to consider the possible clinical relevance
of the vasoconstriction of the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses induced by phenylephrine and bht 933. it has been
suggested that vasodilatation of these `shunt' vessels may play
an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine (heyck,
1969; saxena, 1995). indeed, to date all migraine abortive
agents vasoconstrict carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in
dierent animal species (for references see saxena, 1995;
saxena et al., 1997). while carotid arteriovenous anastomoses
cannot be directly investigated in humans, sumatriptan has
been shown to vasoconstrict arteriovenous anastomoses in the
human forearm (van es et al., 1995). in addition, ergotamine,
dihydroergotamine, clonidine and  xxxd2395xxx , all of which
produce vasoconstriction in the carotid vascular bed in dogs

a-adrenoceptor subtypes and porcine carotid avas

and pigs (spierings & saxena, 1980; verdouw et al., 1984; de
vries et al., 1998; villaloân et al., 1999), interact with aadrenoceptors. at least, a part of the therapeutic eect of these
drugs may be related to their agonist action at these receptors.
thus, our results demonstrating the role of a1- and a2adrenoceptor in mediating vasoconstriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses imply that selective agonists at,
particularly, a2-adrenoceptors (in view of the less ubiquitous
nature of a2-adrenoceptors compared to a1-adrenoceptors)
should have potential anti-migraine properties. in this
connection, further studies, which fall beyond the scope of
the present investigation, will be required to ascertain the
speci®c subtypes of a1- (a1a, a1b, a1d) and a2 (a2a, a2b, a2c)
adrenoceptors mediating the vasoconstrictor response mentioned above. eventually, these results may be helpful in the
development of anti-migraine agents in the future.
