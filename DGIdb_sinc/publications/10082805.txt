abstract
we investigated if repeated administration of cocaine, nicotine, dizocipline žmk-801. and alcohol yields behavioral cross-sensitization
between these agents. swiss webster mice received in their home cage one of the following intraperitoneal ži.p.. injections for 5
consecutive days: ža. saline, žb. cocaine ž20 mgrkg., žc. nicotine ž0.5 mgrkg., žd. mk-801 ž0.3 mgrkg. and že. ethanol ž2.0 grkg..
after a 10-day drug free period, each group ž n s 30. was divided into three subgroups ž n s 10. and received challenge injections of
either cocaine, nicotine or mk-801. the horizontal and vertical movements of the mice were recorded in locomotor activity cages ž test
cage .. among the various drugs tested, only the cocaine and ethanol experienced mice developed sensitization to a challenge injection of
cocaine; mk-801 pretreated mice showed a sensitized response only to a challenge injection of mk-801. in a second experiment, mice in
their home cages received ža. saline, žb. cocaine ž20 mgrkg. or žc. ethanol ž2.0 grkg. for 5 days, and challenged with an i.p. ethanol
injection ž2.0 grkg. after a 10-day drug free period. both, cocaine and ethanol experienced mice developed marked sensitization to
ethanol challenge compared with the saline experienced mice. assessment of the densities of striatal  xxxg2149xxx  ždat. sites
žby w3 hxmazindol binding. 11 days after the extinction of repeated treatment with either cocaine or ethanol revealed a significant increase
ž71–108%. in the number of dat binding sites. thus, among the various psychostimulants investigated in the present study
cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol was only observed. the behavioral sensitization we measured was primarily ‘drug-dependent’, rather than ‘context-dependent’, because animals were exposed to the test cage only once. the finding that cocaine- and
 xxxd102xxx induced behavioral sensitization is associated with upregulation of striatal dat binding sites supports the hypothesis that similar
neural substrates are involved in the psychomotorrrewarding effects of cocaine and alcohol. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights

1. introduction
psychostimulants such as cocaine and other abused
substances že.g., nicotine and alcohol. exert their initial
effects at different binding sites in brain. however, it is
thought that they produce similar changes in the mesolimbic dopamine žda. pathway, increasing da transmission
in the nucleus accumbens žnac. from da neurons in the
ventral tegmental area w10x. the psychomotor and rewarding effects of cocaine are attributed primarily to its ability
to block the reuptake of da that causes a marked increase

in extracellular da w17,30,36x. the reinforcing effect of
alcohol is thought to be mediated by activation of gaba-a
receptors, release of opioid peptides, inhibition of glutamate receptors žref. w18x for review., and augmentation of
mesolimbic da w23,34x. also, increasing evidence support
the role da in the nac in the rewardingraddictive effects
of nicotine w9,13,24x. the involvement of da transmission
in the psychomotor stimulating effects of dizocipline žmk801. is more obscure. mk-801, like the psychotomimetic
agent phencyclidine žpcp., is a noncompetitive n-methyld-aspartate žnmda. receptor antagonist. while some evidence suggests that mk-801-induced hyperactivity is associated with elevation of da in the nac and prefrontal
cortex w12,22x other studies do not support this hypothesis

repeated exposure to psychostimulants causes the development of behavioral sensitization, manifested by a
progressive increase in locomotor activity after repeated
administration of the drug. many studies have focused on
behavioral sensitization to cocaine and amphetamines, because it is thought that this animal model is relevant to the
psychopathology of drug addiction žrefs. w25,31,38x for
reviews.. yet, relatively less is known about the behavioral
outcome of repeated exposure to nicotine, alcohol and
mk-801, and particularly whether cross-sensitization between these substances may develop.
the present study was undertaken to investigate whether
repeated administration of cocaine, nicotine, mk-801 and
ethanol produce cross-sensitization between these drugs.
one major factor contributing to the development of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants is the environment where the drug is delivered. the context-dependent
behavioral sensitization may be an essential element in the
process of sensitization to psychostimulants w6,25,31x. the
present study, however, was designed to reduce contextual
cues and rather focus on the ‘drug-related’ long-term
consequences of repeated exposure to the drugs. therefore,
all drug treatments were delivered in animals’ home cage
and the mice were exposed to the test cage žnovel environment. only once, on the test day. among the various
substances tested, only cross-sensitization between cocaine
and ethanol was discovered. accordingly, we investigated
the density of the striatal  xxxg2149xxx  ždat. in
mice that developed sensitization to cocaine and ethanol.
results indicate that both cocaine- and  xxxd102xxx induced
locomotor sensitization is associated with upregulation of
striatal dat binding sites.

2. materials and methods
2.1. drugs
cocaine–hcl and žy.nicotine di-ž d .tartrate were purchased from sigma žst. louis, mo., mk-801 hydrogen
maleate was purchased from research biochemicals international žnatick, ma.. all drugs and ethanol were dissolved in a saline solution ž0.9% nacl.. w3 hxmazindol

injection in a volume of 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight.
all drugs and saline administrations were delivered in
animals’ home cage once a day between 1000 and 1200 h.
in the first experiment, five groups of mice ž n s 30 per
group. received one of the following treatments once a day
for 5 consecutive days: ža. saline, žb. cocaine ž20 mgrkg.,
žc. nicotine ž0.5 mgrkg., žd. mk-801 ž0.3 mgrkg. and
že. ethanol ž2.0 grkg.. the mice remained drug free for 10
days, and on day 15 each group was divided into three
subgroups ž n s 10 each. and challenged with one of the
following injections ža. cocaine ž20 mgrkg., žb. nicotine
ž0.5 mgrkg. or žc. mk-801 ž0.3 mgrkg.. drug-induced
locomotor activity was then determined as described below. since the first experiment showed that  xxxd102xxx experienced mice developed sensitization to cocaine challenge,
the second experiment was designed to investigate whether
pretreatment with either cocaine or ethanol causes sensitization to a challenge ethanol injection. three groups of
mice ž n s 10 each. received in their home cage either
saline, cocaine ž20 mgrkg. or ethanol ž2.0 grkg. for 5
consecutive days. after a 10-day drug free period the three
groups were challenged with ethanol injection ž2.0 grkg.
and locomotor activity was measured.
2.3. measurement of locomotor actiõity
after the 10-day drug free period, mice were taken
from their home cage and each animal was placed in the
test cage for a 60-min habituation period before the challenge injection of the drug in test was delivered. the test
cage was a standard transparent rectangular rodent cage
ž42 = 24 = 20 cm3 high., and animals’ activity was monitored by activity meter žopto-varimex mini; columbus
instruments, columbus, oh.. the activity meter consists
of an array of 15 infrared emitterrdetector pairs, spaced at
2.65 cm intervals, measuring activity along a single axis of
motion. each emitter and detector was mounted alongside
the length of the cage ž42 cm long.. both the total counts
and the ambulatory counts were recorded and transferred
by a computer counter interface to an ibm computer.
ambulatory counts correspond to horizontal activity, while
the difference between the total and ambulatory counts
corresponds to vertical activity. counts were registered
every 10 min for 30 to 120 min. results in figs. 1–4
represent the cumulative horizontal and vertical counts
registered for 30- or 120-min period.

2.2. animals and schedule of drug administration
2.4. binding of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  to striatal dat
male swiss webster mice ž28–31 g; charles river,
wilmington, ma. were maintained on a 12-h lightrdark
lighting schedule and housed in groups of five with free
access to food and water. the principles of laboratory
animal care žnih publication no. 85-23, revised 1985.
were followed. animals’ weights were monitored daily
before drug administration. drug solutions were freshly
prepared daily and administered by intraperitoneal ži.p..

binding of w3 hxmazindol to the dat was determined in
striatal tissue derived from the same mice investigated for
locomotor activity. accordingly, mice were sacrificed 24 h
after they had received the challenge injection of either
cocaine, ethanol or saline, e.g., day 16 from the initial drug
or saline injections. total of seven groups of mice receiving different treatments were investigated. these included:

significant differences between the cocaine and saline pretreated groups ž p - 0.05. and between saline and ethanol
pretreated groups ž p - 0.05.. these findings indicate that
exposure to either cocaine or ethanol for 5 days resulted in
sensitization to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine.
the pretreatment with either nicotine or mk-801 did not
affect animals’ response to cocaine challenge žfig. 1.. as
indicated in fig. 1, cocaine-induced vertical activity represented relatively a small fraction compared with the horizonal activity generated by the drug. the vertical activity

3.1. effect of cocaine challenge
results in fig. 1 depict the effect of a challenge injection of cocaine ž20 mgrkg. given after a 10-day drug free
period to mice pretreated with either saline, cocaine, nicotine, mk-801 or ethanol. one-way anova analysis of
the horizontal activity following cocaine administrations
revealed a significant drug pretreatment effect ž f w4,45x s

3.2. effect of nicotine challenge
in preliminary studies we investigated the effects of
three different doses of nicotine, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 mgrkg
on mice locomotor activity. the dose of 0.25 mgrkg did
not affect mice locomotor activity, while the dose of 0.5
mgrkg caused a moderate increase ž30–40%. in both
horizontal and vertical activities compared with saline
injection ždata not shown.. since the dose of 1.0 mgrkg
nicotine caused inhibition in locomotor activity and seizures
in a few mice, the dose of 0.5 mgrkg was chosen for
further experiments. results in fig. 2 show the following:
ža. the magnitude of nicotine-induced horizontal and vertical activities in the salinercontrol group is very similar.
žb. one-way anova analysis of nicotine-induced horizontal activity across the five groups showed the following
parameters f w4,45x s 9.6; p - 0.001. cocaine, nicotine
and ethanol pretreatment did not affect animals’ response
to nicotine challenge compared with saline pretreatment,
suggesting neither sensitization to nicotine itself nor
cross-sensitization with cocaine or ethanol. however, the
mk-801 pretreatment caused a significant reduction in the
locomotor stimulating effect of nicotine žboth horizontal
and vertical. compared with saline pretreatment ž p - 0.05;
fig. 2..
3.3. effect of mk-801 challenge
unlike the other agents tested in the present study,
mk-801-induced hyperactivity lasted more than 60 min;
therefore animals’ activity was measured for a total period
of 120 min. the results of mk-801 challenge injections
ž0.3 mgrkg. are shown in fig. 3. one-way anova
analysis of the horizontal activity following mk-801 administrations revealed a significant drug pretreatment effect ž f w4,45x s 11.43; p - 0.001.. post-hoc newman–keuls’ test revealed significant differences between the nicotine and saline pretreated groups ž p - 0.05. as well as
between saline and mk-801 pretreated groups ž p - 0.05..
thus, while nicotine pretreatment caused tolerance or a
reduced response to the challenge mk-801 injection, a

208

y. itzhak, j.l. martinr brain research 818 (1999) 204–211

clear sensitized response in the mk-801 pretreated group
was observed. the finding that cocaine and ethanol pretreated mice responded to mk-801 challenge as the saline
group žfig. 3. suggests no cross-sensitization between
cocainermk-801 and ethanolrmk-801. results in fig. 3
show that mk-801-induced vertical activity represented
relatively a small fraction compared with the horizonal
activity generated by the drug. the vertical activity remained similar across the various groups tested ž f w4,45x s
1.08; p s 0.37..
3.4. effect of ethanol challenge
since results from the studies described above indicated
that cross-sensitization developed only between ethanol
pretreatment and cocaine challenge, the next experiment
was design to investigate first, whether cocaine pretreated
mice developed sensitization to ethanol, and second, to
confirm that pre-exposure to ethanol causes sensitization to
ethanol challenge. a challenge injection of ethanol ž2.0
grkg. given to the saline pretreated group caused an
80–100% increase in both horizontal and vertical activities
compared with the response of saline pretreated mice to a
saline challenge ždata not shown.. the results of the
challenge ethanol injection delivered to the saline, cocaine
and ethanol pretreated mice are described in fig. 4. oneway anova analysis of  xxxd102xxx induced horizontal activity resulted the following parameters f w2,27x s 18.71; p
- 0.001. a significant difference between the response of
saline and cocaine pretreated mice ž p - 0.05. and between
saline and ethanol pretreated mice ž p - 0.05. to ethanol
challenge was observed. these findings indicated that
pre-exposure to cocaine or ethanol results in sensitization
to ethanol challenge, confirming the cross-sensitization
between cocaine and ethanol žfig. 1. as well as the
development of sensitization to ethanol itself. one-way
anova analysis of  xxxd102xxx induced vertical activity across
the three groups žfig. 4. resulted in very similar results
ž f w2,27x s 14.16; p - 0.001. suggesting the development
of sensitization to both horizontal and vertical activities
induced by ethanol.
3.5. regulation of striatal dat binding sites
since the dat has a major role in psychomotor stimulating effects of cocaine we sought to investigate whether
striatal dat binding sites were regulated following repeated cocaine administration. also, since cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol was apparent, the status
of the dat following repeated administration of ethanol
was investigated. results in fig. 5 describe the total
number of striatal w3 hxmazindol binding sites detected by
saturation binding experiments in the various groups. oneway anova analysis across the seven groups revealed
the following parameters ž f w6,14x s 11.59; p - 0.001.. a

significant increase ž71–108%; p - 0.05. in the number of
dat binding sites in the cocaine pretreated groups ždays
1–5. compared with saline pretreatment was observed.
also, a significant increase ž93–98%; p - 0.05. in the
number of dat binding sites in the ethanol pretreated
groups compared with saline pretreatment was observed.
these results indicate that 5-day treatment with either
cocaine or ethanol induces upregulation of striatal dat
binding sites as detected 11 days after extinction of the
repeated drug administration. the dissociation constant
ž k d . of w3 hxmazindol binding was very similar in all
groups tested ž3.5–4.1 nm; data not shown..
since the level of the dat binding sites was determined 24 h after the administration of the challenge injections že.g., day 16., we sought to investigate whether the
challenge cocaine or ethanol injections had any effect on
the binding parameters of w3 hxmazindol. accordingly, saturation binding assays were also done in striatal tissue
derived from mice treated for 5 days with saline and
challenged once with either cocaine or ethanol. results
indicated that 24 h after a single injection of either cocaine
or ethanol did not affect the binding parameters of
w3 hxmazindol žfig. 5.. these findings suggest that the
upregulation of striatal dat sites evolves after repeated
but not one administration of cocaine or ethanol. also, it
appears as if the challenge injections of cocaine or ethanol
given to the drug pretreated mice did not obscure the
assessment of the dat binding sites.

4. discussion
the development of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines after repeated
exposure of mice and rats to these drugs is thought as
relevant to the psychopathology of drug addiction and
craving in humans w25,31x. while many studies had focused on cocaine and amphetamines induced sensitization
žrefs. w25,31,38x for reviews., relatively less is known
about the behavioral consequences of repeated administration of other abused substances such as alcohol and nicotine, and particularly whether cross-sensitization between
these substances of abuse may develop. the major finding
of the present study is that among the various psychoactive
substances tested cross-sensitization was evident only between cocaine and ethanol. this finding and the observation that cocaine- and  xxxd102xxx induced locomotor sensitization was associated with upregulation of striatal dat
binding sites suggest a common or similar mechanism in
the development of sensitization to cocaine and alcohol.
previous studies have shown genetic differences in the
rewarding and stimulating effects of ethanol in mice.
dbar2j mice acquire easily  xxxd102xxx induced conditioned
place preferences and develop sensitization to the locomotor stimulating effect of alcohol w7,8x. while it has been
reported that female swiss webster mice developed nei-

y. itzhak, j.l. martinr brain research 818 (1999) 204–211

ther sensitization to alcohol nor cross-sensitization between cocaine and alcohol w37x, male swiss webster mice
developed sensitization to  xxxd102xxx induced conditioned
place preferences as well as locomotor activity w29x. these
findings suggest that gender differences may contribute to
the sensitivity to alcohol. moreover, the regimen of alcohol and cocaine administration may have a major role in
the establishment of behavioral sensitization. for instance,
it has been reported that 24 h after cessation of repeated
ethanol administration to male to mice there was no
evidence for sensitization to a challenge cocaine or amphetamine injection; however, after a prolonged alcoholfree period ž6 days or 2 months. there was a sensitized
response to challenge injections of these two psychostimulants w20x.. thus, it appears that the period of withdrawal
from the drug is rather crucial for the assessment of the
expression of sensitization. for example, we found that
swiss webster mice treated either with cocaine or
methamphetamine for 5 days show a higher sensitized
response to cocaine and methamphetamine challenge injections after a 10-day drug free period compared with a 24-h
drug free period w14x. based on these findings, in the
present study all challenge drug injections were given after
a 10-day drug free period. by and large our findings that
alcohol experienced mice developed sensitization to cocaine challenge agree with the report of manley and little
w20x. in addition, however, the present study shows that
cocaine-experienced mice developed sensitization to alcohol challenge žfig. 4.. these findings support the hypothesis that there is a ‘full’ cross-sensitization between these
two substances. the finding that ethanol produces sensitization to its own locomotor stimulating effect in male
swiss webster mice žfig. 4. is in agreement with a
previous study showing the development of sensitization to
alcohol in swiss webster mice w29x.
studies on the behavioral outcome of repeated administration of nicotine are more sparse. in a recent study it was
reported that nicotine ž0.6 mgrkg.-induced behavioral sensitization is contingent to the environment of drug administration, suggesting that nicotine-induced behavioral sensitization may be primarily context-dependent w27x. in the
present study repeated administration of nicotine produced
neither a sensitized response to nicotine nor cross-sensitization with any of the agents tested. these results may be
the consequence of our attempt to reduce the context-dependent sensitization; animals were introduced to the test
cage only once, on the test day.
context-dependent sensitization has a major role in the
expression of sensitization not only to nicotine but also
cocaine, amphetamine and alcohol. the pairing of cocaine
or methamphetamine injections with the test cage only
twice during the course of repeated drug administration
žon days 1 and 5. was sufficient to induce context-dependent sensitization in mice w14x. moreover, it has been
reported that under particular experimental conditions amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization in rats may be

209

entirely context-dependent w6x. conditioning contributed
also to  xxxd102xxx induced locomotor and conditioned place
preference sensitization w7x. the present study was designed to diminish context-dependent sensitization by delivering the drug and saline injection in animals’ home
cage and introducing them to the test cage only on the test
day. although the test cage is a novel environment that
affects animals’ behavior, in our experiments the mice
could not associate the stimuli of drug injection with the
test cage. only the injection stimuli itself may have contributed or added to the drug-effect. therefore, cocaine-,
ethanol-, and mk-801-induced sensitization as determined
in the present study depicts primarily drug-induced sensitization. similarly, the cocainerethanol cross-sensitization
observed was in principal drug-dependent rather than context-dependent. taken together, these results support the
hypothesis that the long-term neural changes that developed and led to the expression of behavioral sensitization
to cocaine and ethanol were more drug- than
environment-related. however, if nicotine-induced sensitization is more context-dependent w27x, our experimental
design could not reveal this occurrence.
the studies on nicotinermk-801 behavioral effects
unexpectedly indicated that mk-801 pretreated mice
showed a lower response to a challenge nicotine injection
compared with control žfig. 2.. similarly, the nicotine
pretreated mice showed a reduced response to a challenge
mk-801 injection žfig. 3.. though it is unclear if crosstolerance between nicotine and mk-801 may develop,
several studies have indicated that nicotine interacts with
the nmda receptor complex, and mk-801 interacts with
nicotinic receptors w1,3,5,41x. further studies are necessary
to determine whether these interactions may lead to the
apparent desensitization between the behavioral effects of
these two drugs.
the noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist, mk801, is known to block cocaine induced behavioral sensitization žref. w38x for review., but it has been shown that
repeated administration of mk-801 alone did not produce
cross-sensitization with either cocaine or amphetamine
w39,40x. however, repeated mk-801 administration caused
sensitization to its own locomotor stimulating effect w40x.
results from the present study agree with these findings.
figs. 1 and 3 indicate that there was no cross-sensitization
between cocaine and mk-801, while mk-801 pretreatment
produced sensitization only to mk-801 challenge žfig. 3..
in addition, the present study shows that there is no
cross-sensitization between mk-801 and ethanol. the lack
of cross-sensitization between mk-801rcocaine and mk801rethanol suggests that different mechanisms underlie
the development of sensitization to mk-801 compared
with cocaine and ethanol. while some studies suggested
that mk-801-induced hyperactivity is associated with elevation of da in nac and prefrontal cortex w12,22x, other
studies do not support these findings w16,33x. also, evidence suggests that mk-801-induced hyper-locomotion is

210

in part monoamine-independent, because the drug caused
hyperactivity in monoamine depleted mice w4x.
since the only cross-sensitization observed in the present study was between cocaine and ethanol we sought to
investigate whether the striatal dat binding sites were
similarly modulated by cocaine and ethanol administration.
results indicated that a 5-day exposure to either cocaine or
ethanol resulted in upregulation of striatal dat binding
sites as determined 10 days after the secession of repeated
drug administration. it also appears that the challenge
ethanol or cocaine injections given to the sensitized mice
on day 15 did not affect the binding of w3 hxmazindol to the
dat since a challenge injection of cocaine or ethanol
given to saline pretreated mice had no effect on
w3 hxmazindol binding compared with control values žfig.
5.. these findings suggest that the long-term effect of
repeated exposure to cocaine or ethanol on striatal dat is
comparable, further supporting the notion that similar
mechanisms may underlie the process of sensitization to
cocaine and ethanol.
results from other studies on the regulation of the dat
following repeated exposure to cocaine are somewhat inconsistent. some have reported no change in the number of
striatal dat binding sites w2,28x, while others reported a
decrease in dat in the nac, prefrontal cortex and dorsal
striatum w11,26,35x. in contrast, postmortem studies on
human cocaine-related death w32x and single photon emission computed tomography žspect. studies on abstinent
cocaine-abusing subjects w19x revealed an increase in striatal dat binding sites. the different results may reflect
again various schedules of exposure to cocaine as well as
different periods of withdrawal from the drug. yet, studies
on alcohol-preferring vervet monkeys indicated a marked
increase in dat binding sites following chronic exposure
to alcohol and an extended period of withdrawal from
alcohol w21x. these findings are in a general agreement
with the results of the present study and support the notion
that ethanol and cocaine have a similar regulatory effect on
the dat.
the significance of cocaine- and  xxxd102xxx induced dat
upregulation is not clear. for instance, it is unlikely that
upregulation of striatal dat sites is associated with the
expression of sensitization to cocaine. we had recently
found that more than 75% depletion of striatal and nac
dat sites by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine žmptp. had no effect on the induction or
expression of sensitization to cocaine; the sensitized response of mptp pretreated mice to cocaine challenge was
the same or higher than the response of a control group to
cocaine challenge although throughout the experiment the
mptp pretreated mice had only 20–22% of dat binding
sites compared with control w15x. therefore, the upregulation of dat binding sites following the administration of
cocaine or ethanol may be the result of drug exposure but
probably not the cause for the expression of the sensitized
response to the drugs.

in summary, though the significance of cocaine- and
 xxxd102xxx induced upregulation of striatal dat binding sites
is unclear, the findings that there is a full cross-sensitization between cocaine and alcohol and both caused a corresponding adaptation in striatal dat sites, suggest that
similar neural substrates are involved in the
psychomotorrrewarding effects of these agents.
