design, synthesis and biological evaluation of  xxxd137xxx  derivatives as ache inhibitors.   xxxd137xxx  (1), an old ache inhibitor, is endowed with an outstanding affinity and a peculiar mechanism of action that, taken together, make it a very promising pharmacological tool for the treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad). unfortunately, the bisquaternary structure of 1 prevents its passage through the blood brain barrier. in a search of centrally active  xxxd137xxx  derivatives, we planned to synthesize tertiary amines of 1, such as 2 and 3. in addition, to add new insights into the binding mechanism of the inhibitor, we designed constrained analogues of  xxxd137xxx  by incorporating the diamine functions into cyclic moieties (4-12). the biological evaluation of the new compounds has been assessed in vitro against human ache and  xxxg248xxx . all tertiary amine derivatives resulted more than 1000-fold less potent than 1 and, unlike prototype, did not show any selectivity between the two enzymes. this result, because of recent findings concerning the role of  xxxg248xxx  in ad, makes our compounds, endowed with a well-balanced profile of ache/ xxxg248xxx  inhibition, valuable candidates for further development. to better clarify the interactions that account for the high affinity of 1, docking simulations and molecular dynamics studies on the ache-1 complex were also carried out.
