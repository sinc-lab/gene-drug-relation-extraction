we report a patient with inappropriate secretion of  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) and a pituitary mass. although she had
been treated for biochemical hyperthyroidism with thyroid surgery and radioiodine ablation, she had never
complained of specific symptoms or demonstrated signs of overt thyroid dysfunction. on evaluation, she had
increased free  xxxd1863xxx  and tsh levels, normal serum glycoprotein a-subunit levels, and a significant tsh overresponse to exogenous  xxxg2328xxx  stimulation. magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement showed a pituitary enlargement with suprasellar extension. an indium in 111 pentetreotide
scan showed an abnormal focus of radionuclide accumulation in the pituitary area. sequencing of the trb gene
showed that the patient was heterozygous for a new single nucleotide substitution resulting in the replacement
of the normal arginine with a serine at amino acid 320 (r320s). we review the difficulties encountered in
establishing a correct diagnosis in patients with inappropriate secretion of tsh in combination with pituitary
enlargement. due to its possible false-negative results, we do not recommend the use of indium in 111 pentetreotide as a tool in the differential diagnosis of inappropriate secretion of tsh.

introduction

t

he syndrome of inappropriate secretion of thyroid
stimulating hormone (tsh) is characterized by a nonsuppressible serum tsh in the presence of elevated serum
free thyroid hormone concentrations (1,2). it is classified as
non-neoplastic, this usually being thyroid hormone resistance syndrome (3,4) and neoplastic (tsh-secreting adenomas). resistance to thyroid hormones (rth) is an
autosomal dominant disorder. as there is reduced sensitivity
to the negative feedback effects of thyroid hormone on tsh
secretion, serum tsh and free thyroid hormone levels are
elevated (1). in about 90% of patients mutations in the thyroid
 xxxg1603xxx  b (trb) can be found. individuals are almost always heterozygous for the mutant allele, which interferes with the activity of the normal allele (2). more than
100 mutations have been reported in the trb gene to date.
except for one family, all mutations have been found in exons
7 to 10 of the trb gene and 15% of mutations occur de novo (1).
tsh-secreting adenomas are rare and constitutively secrete tsh, which, in turn, causes hyperthyroidism (5). tshsecreting pituitary tumors are usually macroadenomas, and
imaging studies typically show evidence for pituitary enlargement (6). in contrast, pituitary enlargement is very rare in

patients with rth (6). here we report a new mutation in the
trb gene that was found in a woman who also had evidence
for pituitary hyperplasia by magnetic resonance imaging
(mri). her history was even more complex because she had
received thyroid ablative treatment for goiter. the pituitary
findings occurred despite the relatively large doses of levothyroxine ( xxxd2750xxx ) she was treated with after thyroid ablation.
patient
at the age of 60 years the patient presented to another
medical facility with a long history of goiter and tests
were interpreted as indicative of hyperthyroidism. she had
been diagnosed with goiter in her youth and had received
continuous iodine and low dose  xxxd2594xxx  therapy. she
denied a history of cardiac, dermatologic, or emotional
symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism. a left hemithyroidectomy was performed as treatment for the presumptive diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, and the pathological
diagnosis was multinodular goiter. after surgery, the patient
did not have symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.
at age 60 on routine physical examination there was a
small goiter in the right side, and the patient had no tremor or tachycardia. thyroid function tests demonstrated

to >150 mu=ml at 20 minutes. a technetium tc 99 m thyroid
scan and thyroid sonogram showed evidence of a previous
left hemithyroidectomy and nodular goiter on the right. it was
thought that her thyroid hormone levels could be better
controlled by thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine followed by  xxxd2750xxx  treatment. therefore she received an ablative
dose of radioactive iodine. after this treatment with radioiodine she developed clinical and biochemical features of
hypothyroidism and was treated with  xxxd2750xxx  with doses ranging
from 200 to 300 mg daily. most of the time the patient was
maintained on 200 mg of  xxxd2750xxx  (for several years), in spite of
persistent elevated levels of tsh (usually ranging between 30
and 50 mu=ml) and persistent elevated levels of ft4 (usually
ranging between 1.4 and 1.9 ng=dl). under 300 mg of  xxxd2750xxx , tsh
was closer but never reached normal values (16.8 mu=ml).
the clinical situation of the patient was ‘‘good’’ and the attending clinicians did not deem it appropriate to further increase the t4 dose in an elderly woman.
at the age of 80 she was admitted to another hospital with
pancytopenia secondary to hypersplenism. on physical examination there was splenomegaly and a nodular goiter on
the right side of her neck. the pulse was 47 per minute but
otherwise there were no features of hypothyroidism. serum
cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine kinase, liver enzymes,
ferritin, and  xxxg2066xxx  were all normal
range (data not shown). under treatment with 300 mg of  xxxd2750xxx 
daily, thyroid function tests showed an elevated tsh
(16.8 mu=ml) with increased ft4 (1.79 ng=dl). an mri with
gadolinium enhancement of the pituitary showed supracellular extension with coronal and sagittal diameters of 13 and
10 mm respectively (fig. 2). a whole-body scan performed 24
hours after injection of indium in 111 pentreotide showed
homogenous uptake in the pituitary (fig. 3). although thy-

roxine replacement was continued at supraphysiological
dosage, tsh did not reach the absolute normal range.
at age 80, a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) sequencing of
the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  b (trb) found that the patient
was heterozygous for a single nucleotide substitution from
cgc to agc resulting in an amino acid substitution (normal
arginine 320 to serine). the patient had no children and no
other members of the family had any abnormalities of tsh or
thyroid hormone levels. actual tsh and ft4 values were
available for two sisters and one nephew (tsh 1.5, 1.6, and
1.5 mu=ml [normal range 0.47–4.68 mu=ml] and ft4 1.59, 1.2,
and 1.2 ng=dl [normal range 0.78–2.19 ng=dl], respectively).
the patient was lost for follow-up of thyroid function and
pituitary mri and died after clinical complications following
an accidental hip fracture.
discussion
in this report we highlight the diagnostic dilemma created
by a pituitary enlargement in a patient with inappropriate tsh secretion. the differential diagnosis between a
tsh-secreting adenoma and rth includes standard steps:
symptomatology, a-glycoprotein subunit measurement, trhstimulated tsh measurement, mri of the pituitary, and pituitary scintigraphy with radiolabeled octreotide (octreoscan).
because none of these tests alone appears to be diagnostic
of either rth or tsh-oma, they are usually performed together (1–4).
the hallmark of rth is the paucity of symptoms and signs
of thyroid dysfunction despite the presence of high serum t4
and t3 concentrations. affected patients may have some
symptoms or signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism,
particularly tachycardia, hyperactivity, and hyperreflexia, but
they are variable (1). overt hypothyroidism is more common
in those patients who, because of an erroneous diagnosis of
hyperthyroidism, have received treatment to decrease thyroid
secretion such as surgery or radioiodine (1). in contrast, most
patients with tsh-secreting adenomas have the typical
symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. goiter is usually
present in rth (65–90%), as well as in all patients with tshomas (1–4). our patient, after thyroid ablative therapy under
replacement therapy with high doses of  xxxd2750xxx , had very few
symptoms of hypo- or hyperthyroidism. in addition, all

markers of peripheral thyroid hormone action, except for a
low pulse rate, were all within the normal range.
in general, the a-glycoprotein subunit is elevated in most
tsh-omas (85%), independently of previous thyroid ablation
(4). by contrast in rth the a-glycoprotein is not elevated, as
was the case for our patient. the trh stimulation test can also
help to distinguish both entities. while rth patients had a
high response to trh, tsh-secreting adenomas usually
function autonomously and trh would not be expected to
alter the rate of tsh secretion (1,2). in fact, trh simulation
fails to cause more than a twofold rise in tsh secretion in 80%
of tsh tumors; nevertheless, 20% of patients have normal
response to trh stimulation.
mri is another tool to distinguish between rth and tshoma, as most tsh-omas are usually diagnosed at the stage
of macroadenomas (6). the occurrence of invasive macroadenomas is particularly high among tsh-oma patients with
previous thyroid ablation by surgery or radioiodine (7,8).
unfortunately, imaging may not be definitive. firstly, the
incidence of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas should
be equal to the general population. in addition, rth could be
associated with thyrotroph hyperplasia and=or adenoma
formation in some individuals (7–10). in this regard, pituitary
hyperplasia in response to other causes of long-standing hypothyroidism is well documented (11) and has also been reported in one patient with rth (7).
radiolabeled octreotide (octreoscan) has been useful in
detecting different types of endocrine tumors that express
somatostatin receptors (5,12). it has also been considered a
useful tool in the differential diagnosis of the syndrome of
inappropriate tsh secretion, as tsh-omas can be visualized
in most, if not all patients, and it can guide the treatment
(12,13). in our patient, there was a clear diffuse uptake at the
level of the pituitary, similar to that found on tsh-producing
macroadenomas. to our knowledge, this is the first case of
rth in which an octreoscan was performed. we believe that
octreotide scan could be positive in patients with rth that
have developed long-standing hypothyroidism and pituitary
hyperplasia after several thyroid ablative therapies, such as
surgery and radioiodine, as was the case of our patient. in our
patient the diagnosis was made by the analysis of the trb
gene that showed a r320s mutation. although different mutations have been reported in this region, to the best of our

proach, since it may further promote pituitary enlargement.
rather, thyroid ablation in rth patients should be discouraged. if thyroid ablation has been performed, supraphysiological doses of  xxxd2750xxx  are often necessary to avoid symptomatic
hypothyroidism and pituitary enlargement.
