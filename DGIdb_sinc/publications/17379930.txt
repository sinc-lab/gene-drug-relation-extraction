this article describes how the discovery of a protein
almost 100 years ago led to a clinical treatment for
type 2 diabetes. food intake, but also stimulation of
the sympathetic nervous system (for example physical
exercise), stimulates the secretion of glucagon-likepeptide-1 (glp-1), derived from the glucagon precursor
proglucagon in the small intestine. glp-1 stimulates
the production and secretion of insulin, the release of
somatostatin, glucose utilisation by increasing insulin
sensitivity and in animal studies also b-cell function and
expansion (proliferation). it inhibits glucagon release,
gastric emptying, appetite and food intake via the central
nervous system and in animal experiments also apoptosis
of b-cells.
since glp-1 has to be administered parenterally and its
half-life is short, a long-acting  xxxg899xxx  agonist
(exenatide) and a long-acting glp-1 analogue ( xxxd2495xxx )
have been developed as well as an inhibitor of  xxxg651xxx  (the
enzyme that breaks down endogenous glp-1). clinical
studies with exenatide and  xxxd2495xxx  as monotherapy
show a significant increase in the postprandial
insulin concentration as well as a smaller increase in
the postprandial glucose values. adding these drugs
to standard oral glucose-lowering medication shows
improvement in glucose and insulin concentrations and
hba 1c compared with adding placebo. the effect of
exenatide on hba1c is the same as adding a long-acting
insulin analogue ( xxxd2362xxx ), but the increase in weight
after adding insulin is not seen after exenatide, where even
a small decrease in weight is found. this is an important
advantage, because most type 2 patients are already obese.
whether less b-cell apoptosis and maintenance of b-cell
function occurs, as has been shown in animal studies, has
to be awaited.
clinical studies with the oral  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors sitagliptin
and  xxxd3510xxx  show promising results, but are only
published as abstracts at scientific meetings.

int r o d uct i o n
the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus includes
correction of both insulin resistance and impaired insulin
secretion. therefore, besides lifestyle intervention,
treatment consists of medical therapy with drugs that
lower insulin resistance such as metformin and thiazolidinediones (tzds) but also insulin secretaguoges (or
insulin). although hyperinsulinaemia is a hallmark of the
first years after diagnosis, the first-phase insulin response
(peak after a glucose load) is impaired or absent early in
the disease. this first-phase insulin response is caused
by a peptide from the small intestine secreted after an
oral glucose load. as early as in 1906, moore discovered
a chemical stimulant for the pancreas produced by the
duodenum. in 1930, labarre introduced the term ‘incretin’.
mcintyre et al. were the first to demonstrate an incretin
effect in 1964. in 1969 brown et al. isolated the protein
and called it gastric inhibitory peptide. in 1982 lund
et al. identified the cdna for  xxxg873xxx . in 1983
bell et al. cloned human cdna for  xxxg873xxx  from
which glucagon-like-peptide-1 and glp-2 are a part. in
1987 kreymann et al. demonstrated that glp-1 indeed
stimulates insulin-secretion in humans.1

glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) and
glp-i are the two most important incretins produced
by the duodenum. the hypothalamus also produces an

( xxxg70xxx ); the exact contribution of this peptide to insulin
secretion is not clear yet. gip induces ±60% of the incretin
effect. figure 1 shows the enteroinsulinar axis: the uptake
of carbohydrates and amino acids in the gut results in
an endocrine response in the islets of langerhans. it
also causes neurotransmission to both the islets, the
liver and via the nuclei of the medulla oblongata to the
hypothalamus. efferent neurons from the hypothalamus
and medulla oblongata activate the vagus nerve and the
pancreas and inhibit the gastrointestinal tract.2,3 the
endogenous secretion of gip in type 2 diabetes is normal
and exogenous administration of gip does not increase
the insulin response. the endogenous secretion of  xxxg873xxx  in type 2 diabetes, however, is decreased. exogenous
administration does induce insulin secretion. 4
glp-1 is predominantly produced in the small intestine.
after intake of carbohydrates a sixfold increase in the
plasma concentration is observed. the time of action
is only a few minutes. it is cleared from the plasma
by the liver and the kidney.5 the effect of glp-1 on
different tissues is shown in table 1. glp-1 stimulates
insulin production and insulin release after food intake,
somatostatin release, glucose uptake by increasing insulin
sensitivity and in animal models also b-cell function and
expansion (proliferation). it inhibits glucagon release,
gastric emptying, appetite and food intake via the central
nervous system and also apoptosis of the b-cells. it also
influences body temperature, energy expenditure, fluid
and salt retention and release of pituitary hormones.6-8
administration of glp-1 to people with type 2 diabetes
lowers both fasting and postprandial glucose and decreases
appetite and food intake.9,10 probably indirectly, as a result
of reduced intake of free  xxxd2154xxx  and glucose, insulin
sensitivity and b-cell function increase (less glucose

toxicity). glp-1 has to be administered parenterally and
has a short half-life, which makes it unsuitable for daily
use. therefore, glp-1 analogues have been developed with
a longer half-life by making natural glp-1 resistant to the
degrading enzyme  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ), which
made twice daily subcutaneous dosing possible. also a
 xxxg899xxx  agonist has been developed (exenatide) with
a glp-1-like action. finally, drugs that increase endogenous
glp-1 by inhibiting  xxxg651xxx , the enzyme responsible for
degradation of glp-1, are becoming available.

weight loss of 2.3 kg was seen. hypoglycaemia at night
was significantly more often seen in the group treated with
 xxxd2362xxx . hood evaluated the use of exenatide in patients
with type 2 diabetes using insulin and/or oral hypoglycaemic
drugs with an hba1c ≤7.0%.21 the patients using an insulin
secretagogue were able to discontinue its use, and the
patients using insulin could reduce the mean daily dose by
-37% and the number of injections by -39%. the average
weight loss in the 3.6 months was -5 kg compared with a
weight gain of +4.8 kg in the preceding 2 years.
post-hoc interim analyses of the 82-week completer cohort 20
showed a significant 12% increase in hdl cholesterol, a
16% lowering of triglycerides and 3% lowering of diastolic
blood pressure. total cholesterol, ldl-c,  xxxg175xxx 
and systolic blood pressure did not improve significantly.

exenatide
as is often seen in medicine, exenatide was discovered
more or less by chance. the peptide from the saliva of the
gila monster happened to be homologous with glp-1 for
53%, showed more affinity for the  xxxg899xxx  than
glp-1 itself and was ddp iv resistant. it enhances insulin
secretion, delays gastric emptying and lessens food intake.
the plasma half-life is three to four hours.9 clinical studies
show both effects on glucose regulation, body weight and
lipid parameters.
studies with exenatide as add-on therapy with oral
hypoglycaemic drugs
exenatide has been added to either sulphonylurea,12-14
metformin, or a combination of both in people with type
2 diabetes and hba1c >7% on this medication only. the
glycaemic result after 30 weeks was similar in all studies
and showed a significant decrease in both fasting and
postprandial glucose and a change in hba1c of -0.8%
compared with +0.1% with placebo. in the first study,
hba1c decreased significantly in comparison with placebo
(slight increase) and even more with exenatide 10 mg
subcutaneously twice daily. starting with a mean hba1c
of 8.6%, 41% of patients reached an hba1c of <7% after
30 weeks. there was a significant decrease in body weight
of 1.6 kg after 30 weeks. extension studies of two years show
that the favourable effects on fasting glucose and hba1c are
sustained.15-17 among patients who completed the 82 weeks
of treatment, mean body weight further decreased from
–2.1 kg at 30 weeks to –4.4 kg at 82 weeks, respectively.
exenatide bid has recently been reported to have favourable
effects as add-on therapy with tzds and with combination
therapy of tzd+metformin.18

exenatide was approved by the fda as an adjunctive
treatment for type 2 diabetes in patients unable to achieve
adequate control using metformin and/or sulphonylurea
therapy. in europe the emea gave similar approval.
a slow-release preparation (lar) for once-weekly
subcutaneous administration has been tested in rats. a
phase ii exenatide lar clinical trial in 45 patients with
type 2 diabetes treated with metformin or diet and exercise
showed promising results.22
effects on increase in b-cell mass, as demonstrated in
animal models, can only be shown with surrogate markers
like durability of glycaemic control in humans. long-term
controlled clinical trials addressing this issue are currently
being performed.

l i r a g l ut i d e
 xxxd2495xxx  is a long-acting glp-1 analogue that is 97%
homologous to glp-1, which makes it suitable for oncedaily subcutaneous injection. acylating the peptide with a
free fatty acid chain improves binding to albumin, makes
it less accessible to  xxxg651xxx  and inhibits renal filtration.
also the binding to albumin induces a slower resorption
from the place of injection. animal studies have shown
that  xxxd2495xxx  decreases plasma glucose levels, increases
insulin secretion, reduces glucagon secretion, inhibits
gastric emptying and appetite, resulting in a reduced body
weight and increased b-cell volume.10
phase i studies in humans have been performed, while
phase ii studies have been completed23-28 or are ongoing.
hypoglycaemia is seldom reported with  xxxd2495xxx  as
monotherapy. dose-titration studies investigated doses
of up to 2 mg/day. in the five-week study by nauck
et al. 27  xxxd2495xxx  added to metformin monotherapy
reduced fasting glucose by -3.9 mmol/l and hba1c by
1.2%.  xxxd2495xxx  in combination with metformin was
significantly more effective than metformin combined

studies comparing exenatide with insulin/as add-on therapy
with insulin
in two studies19,20 exenatide was compared with insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  once daily added to the same oral glucose-lowering
drugs over a period of 26 weeks. the dose of  xxxd2362xxx  was
titrated to reach a fasting glucose of 5 mmol/l. a similar
reduction in hba1c of -1.1% was achieved. the fasting
glucose was significantly lower in the  xxxd2362xxx -treated
patients, whereas exenatide provided significantly lower
postprandial blood glucose values. the fluctuation in blood
glucose values was significantly less with exenatide than
with  xxxd2362xxx . given the epidemiological data that
lower postprandial glucose values are more important than
fasting glucose in reducing the risks of cardiovascular
disease this may contribute more to reduction of cvd risks
than is indicated by the reduction in hba1c. the group
treated with  xxxd2362xxx  showed an increase in body weight
of 1.8 kg, whereas in the group treated with exenatide a

with glimeperide. body weight was significantly lower in
the metformin and  xxxd2495xxx  group vs metformin with
glimeperide. frequently reported side effects were nausea,
vomiting and diarrhoea as with all glp-1-like drugs, but
adverse events were mild, transient and rarely caused
discontinuation of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment.

although the pathophysiological processes in time and the
natural history of type 2 diabetes are not quite clear, it is
evident that both insulin secretion and insulin action are
impaired at the start of the disease. especially the first-phase
insulin response is absent. in theory this would imply that
treatment with glp-1 analogues or receptor agonists with or
without  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors in the early phase of the disease
in combination with a drug that reduces insulin resistance,
such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, is the most
physiological treatment option. there is evidence, however,
that these drugs are still effective further in the course of the
disease when standard treatment is no longer effective. one
of the most promising results of this new class of drugs is
the absence of increase in weight and even weight reduction
instead of the increase in weight often seen with the use
of insulin secretagogues as sulphonylurea and insulin.
of course, results of long-term studies have to be awaited
concerning both long-term efficacy and safety. however,
if positive, the use of sulphonylurea derivatives, especially
because of their possible adverse events in case of myocardial
ischaemia, could become obsolete and insulin therapy only
reserved for patients with absolute insulin deficiency.

dpp - iv i nh i b i t o r s
although studies in healthy volunteers show that
administration of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors alone decreases
endogenous glp-1 production, the administration of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors induces a doubling of endogenous glp-1
production and increases the ratio of active/total glp-1
making a physiological insulin secretion possible in people
with type 2 diabetes.14 the  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors also increase
the physiological effects of other incretins such as gastric
inhibitory peptide and  xxxg70xxx . the exact consequences of
these additional effects are still not known. the possible
advantage of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors in comparison with  xxxg873xxx  analogues is that they cause little delay in gastric
emptying, which might diminish gastrointestinal side
effects. however, the effect is less powerful than that of
lp-1, glp-1-receptor agonists or glp analogues and starts
later (after a few weeks).
twelve-week monotherapy with  xxxd3510xxx  improves
hba1c in patients with type 2 diabetes. the higher the
baseline hba1c, the more the effect.29  xxxd3510xxx  at a dose
of 100 mg for 4 weeks reduced fasting and postprandial
glucose concentrations, as well as plasma glucagon levels,
while the ratio of insulin to glucose increased.30 adding
 xxxd3510xxx  to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes
resulted in a decrease in hba1c of 0.8% after 12 weeks
compared with placebo. this difference was maintained
in a 52-week extension study.31 insulin secretion, measured
by a postmeal area under the 0-30 min c-peptide curve,
was increased in the  xxxd3510xxx  group compared with
metformin alone. insulin sensitivity during meal ingestion
also increased in the  xxxd3510xxx -treated patients.32
clinical studies with sitagliptin and presentations at
the american diabetes association and international
diabetes federation meetings in june and december 2006,
respectively, indicated that sitagliptin is well tolerated
and effective in both monotherapy and in combination
with metformin or pioglitazone without significant
hypoglycaemia or weight gain.33-35
