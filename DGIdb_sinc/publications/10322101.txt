antagonistes des récepteurs des leucotriènes et
composés associés

leukotrienes (lts), lipid mediators of inflammation, have
proved to be important biochemicals involved in the symptoms and physiological changes of asthma. in the past year
and a half, the development of three new drugs that modulate
the lt pathway has been completed. the first subclass of
these drugs, leukotriene receptor antagonists (ltra) ( xxxd3545xxx  and montelukast), blocks the interaction of the cysteinyl form of the lts with the cell type bearing the receptor.
the second subclass, the  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) inhibitors
( xxxd3554xxx ) inhibits the  xxxg147xxx  enzyme, which prevents the formation of both cysteinyl lts and ltb4. the lt modulators
have shown efficacy in inhibiting the physiological changes
occurring after allergen,  xxxd234xxx  and exercise
challenge in asthmatics. in addition, they have shown efficacy in improving symptoms, beta-agonist use and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) in chronic, ‘day-to-day’
asthma in patients with mild disease. comparison studies
with low doses of inhaled corticosteroids suggest that lt
modulators may have similar effects on symptom scores and
beta-agonist use, but have lesser effects on fev1. finally,
emerging data suggest that these drugs are beneficial in decreasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids necessary to control more moderate to severe asthma. while long term studies
will be helpful in determining the ‘disease modifying’ effects
of these drugs, data suggest that these drugs are useful in the
treatment of a broad range of asthmatic patients.

résumé : les leucotriènes (lt), médiateurs lipidiques de l’inflammation, ont prouvé qu’ils sont d’importants agents biochimiques impliqués dans les symptômes et les changements
physiologiques de l’asthme. au cours des dix huit derniers mois,
trois nouveaux médicaments qui modulent la voie des leucotriènes
ont été mis au point. la première sous-classe de ces médicaments,
les antagonistes des récepteurs des leucotriènes (arlt) ( xxxd3545xxx 
et montélukast), bloquent l’interaction des leucotriènes à groupe
cystéinyle avec le type de cellule contenant le récepteur. la
deuxième sous-classe, les inhibiteurs de la 5-lipoxygénase ( xxxd3554xxx ), inhibent l’enzyme  xxxg147xxx , qui prévient la formation à la fois des
lt cystéiniques et des lt b4. les modulateurs des lt ont démontré leur efficacité pour inhiber les changements physiologiques qui
surviennent après une épreuve d’effort, un test de provocation à
l’ xxxd234xxx  ou aux allergènes chez les asthmatiques. de plus, ils contribuent à l’amélioration des symptômes, à réduire l’utilisation des
bêta-agonistes et à augmenter le vems chez les patients atteints
d’asthme chronique mais léger. des études comparatives avec des
doses faibles de corticostéroïdes en inhalation permettent de croire
que les modulateurs des lt ont des effets similaires sur les scores
des symptômes et de l’utilisation des bêta-agonistes, mais des effets
moindres sur le vems. finalement, des données émergentes permettent de croire que ces médicaments auraient un effet bénéfique
concernant la réduction de la dose de corticostéroïdes nécessaire
pour maîtriser l’asthme modéré à grave. des études à long terme seront nécessaires pour déterminer les effets « modificateurs de la maladie » de ces agents, mais les données laissent à penser que ces
médicaments sont utiles pour traiter une grande variété de patients
asthmatiques.

nflammation is a significant contributing factor to the
symptoms and physiological changes of asthma. activation of the  xxxd208xxx  cascade leads to production of
lipid mediators known as leukotrienes (lts), important components of this inflammatory process. in the past 18 months,
new drugs have become available that were specifically developed to interfere with that pathway, namely, lt receptor
antagonists (ltras) and  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) inhibitors.
this is the first time that such ‘designer drugs’ have become
available as a new option to manage chronic asthma.
the lt pathway
lts are potent lipid mediators that have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma (figure 1). they are endproducts of the metabolism of  xxxd208xxx , formed from
phospholipids, which are ubiquitous elements of cellular
membranes.  xxxd208xxx  is formed from phospholipids
through enzymatic activation of various phospholipases and
can then be further metabolized by a variety of pathways.
these include the cyclo-oxygenase pathway, which leads to
production of prostaglandins and thromboxane (and is inhibited by  xxxd234xxx  (asa) and other nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory compounds), and the  xxxg147xxx  pathway,
which leads to the production of lts (1). activation of  xxxg147xxx 
is thought to require generalized cellular activation and the
availability of  xxxd208xxx  as substrate. it is presumed to
require interactions with a protein known as  xxxg147xxx  activating
protein, which is thought to channel  xxxd208xxx  to the
enzyme  xxxg147xxx .  xxxg147xxx  activation then leads to the production
of an intermediate known as  xxxg1346xxx , which can be further metabolized, depending on cell type, to ltb4 or the cysteinyl
lts, ltc4, d4 and e4 (formerly known as slow-reacting
substance of anaphylaxis).
lts are produced almost exclusively by cells of the myeloid lineage. ltb4 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils, as well as an activator of neutrophils,
which appears to enhance adhesion and migration of the cells
through the endothelium (2). cysteinyl lts are potent bronchoconstrictors (100 to 1000 times more potent than histamine) that enhance membrane permeability and decrease
mucociliary clearance (2). in addition, lte4 has recently
been shown to have chemoattractant properties for eosinophils in the lungs of asthmatics (3). both cysteinyl lts and
ltb4 have been measured in the airways of asthmatics (4,5).
cysteinyl lts in humans appear to activate cells predominantly through a single receptor, known as the cystlt1 receptor, although the exact structure of the receptor and
whether other receptor types may exist remain elusive (1).
ltb4 functions solely through the ltb4 receptor, which
was recently cloned (6).
modulation of lt activity has centered on two components of the pathway (table 1). both antagonists of the lt
receptor and inhibitors of  xxxg147xxx  have undergone large scale
clinical trials. the chief biological difference between the
ltras and the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors is that ltras inhibit the activity of the cysteinyl lts only, while  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors block
the production of both ltb4 and the cysteinyl lts, but

whether this difference has clinical applications for asthma
therapy remains unclear. ltras and  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors have
been studied in both laboratory-induced asthma, such as allergen challenge, and in ‘day-to- day’ or ‘chronic’ asthma.
these agents have largely been studied in mild to moderate
asthmatics, but data from more severe patients are emerging
as well.
efficacy in laboratory asthma
(challenge and bronchoscopic studies)
in recent years, ltras have been developed that shift the
dose response to inhaled ltd4 30- to 100-fold, indicating almost complete blockade of the lt receptor (7). it is not possible to evaluate  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors in this same way. in addition, lt modulators effectively inhibit allergen- and
asa-induced asthma, with lesser reductions in exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction. while the inhibition of the late
bronchoconstriction associated with allergen challenge is approximately 50%, the early phase of bronchoconstriction,
can respir j vol 6 no 2 march/april 1999

leukotriene-modulating drugs

which is thought to be predominantly mast cell driven, is almost completely abolished (8,9). in addition to the improvement in obstruction, the ltra  xxxd3545xxx  (accolate, zeneca
pharma) has demonstrated a small but significant ability to
limit the increase in airway reactivity, which normally occurs
after allergen exposure.
bronchoconstriction associated with asa challenge has
also been nearly completely prevented by ltras and  xxxg147xxx 
inhibitors, confirming the importance of lts in the bronchospasm associated with the asa reaction (10-12). recently,
longer term studies of asa-sensitive asthmatics support the
efficacy of chronic dosing in this population as well (13,14).
the bronchoconstriction associated with exercise appears
to be consistently inhibited by ltras in the range of 30% to
50%. this inhibition appears to compare favourably to pretreatment with  xxxd1763xxx  (15). a long term study with montelukast (singulair, merck frosst canada inc) demonstrated
sustained protection against exercise-induced bronchospasm
over the 12 weeks of the study, when montelukast was taken
16 to 18 h before exercise (16).
the effect of these drugs on inflammation in the airways
has only been partially addressed, and no biopsy studies have
yet been reported. however, preliminary work suggests that
ltras may decrease the inflammatory cell influx into the
airways after instillation of allergen and over time. administration of  xxxd3545xxx  for one week before instillation of allergen directly into the airways of asthmatics significantly
decreased the influx of basophils and lymphocytes into the
airways 48 h after allergen exposure compared with placebo.
 xxxd3545xxx  tended to decrease the numbers of eosinophils
migrating into the airways also (17). montelukast has also
demonstrated an effect on sputum eosinophils over time (18).
in a nocturnal asthma model, the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd3554xxx 
( xxxd3554xxx , abbott pharmaceuticals, usa), was found to decrease urinary and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (bal) lt
levels, while improving pulmonary function in patients with
nocturnal asthma (figure 2). the improvement in function
correlated with the levels of ltb4 in the airways. additionally, the eosinophils in the bal and peripheral blood decreased significantly, supporting a cellular-level anti-inflammatory effect (5).
chronic asthma
some lt modulators can induce a rapid and significant
immediate bronchodilating effect of between 15% and 30%
(19). this effect has also been seen with  xxxd3554xxx  and high
doses of  xxxd3545xxx  (20,21). these results imply that lts are
always present in the airways of asthmatics and are playing
an important role in maintaining baseline asthmatic bronchoconstriction. in addition, concomitant treatment of these individuals with a beta-agonist induces an additive effect on
the bronchodilation, suggesting that the two types of compounds are working through different pathways (19).
several long term, placebo controlled trials have been
published in abstract or manuscript form with the ltras
 xxxd3545xxx ,  xxxd2995xxx  ( xxxd2995xxx , onon-ono pharma, japan)
and montelukast, and the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3554xxx . although

the patients studied had mild asthma as judged by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1), medication needs and symptom scores, these compounds have consistently shown both
statistical and clinical efficacy in this population (20,22-24).
use of these compounds has led to sustained improvement in
fev1, symptom scores and beta-agonist use for the duration
of the trial compared with placebo. nocturnal asthma symptoms also appear to be improved by these compounds.  xxxd3545xxx , montelukast and  xxxd3554xxx  also significantly decreased
the number of occasions on which study subjects needed a
steroid burst (24,25).
studies comparing inhaled corticosteroids with  xxxd3545xxx , montelukast and  xxxd2995xxx  have now been carried ou
with remarkably similar results. all of these studies suggest
that ltras are not as effective as low dose beclomethasone
in improving fev1. interestingly, however, very few differences are seen between the two types of drugs when evaluating other end-points such as and beta-agonist use (26,27).
finally, from a clinical efficacy perspective, recent studies with all of the lt-modulating drugs suggest that there are
additional benefits to the use of these drugs in patients cur191

rently treated with inhaled corticosteroids. the only study
published to date demonstrated that the concomitant use of
 xxxd2995xxx  allowed the inhaled corticosteroid dose
(1600 µg/day) to be cut to 800 µg/day in moderate asthmatics
without compromising asthma control (figure 3) (28). a
similar study was done with montelukast (29). in a somewhat
different approach, adding a lt drug (montelukast or  xxxd3554xxx ) to low doses of inhaled corticosteroids was better than
doubling or maintaining the dose of the inhaled steroids,
similar to results of studies with salmeterol and theophylline
(30,31).
from a health economic perspective, there are statistically
significant improvements in days missed from work and
school, as well as significantly decreased rates of asthma exacerbation (23). a recent year-long study has shown that the
addition of  xxxd3554xxx  to “usual care” (inhaled steroids, theophylline, cromones) appears to reduce the need for steroid
bursts, emergency room visits and hospitalizations compared
with the “usual care” alone group (32).
these drugs are dosed orally anywhere from one to four
times/day. this oral dosing may lead to better compliance
with these medications.  xxxd3545xxx  is dosed as 20 mg orally
bid (without food), montelukast 10 mg every evening
(adults) and  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg qid. an eight-week study with
montelukast in children recently demonstrated safety and efficacy compared with placebo in children on no or concurrent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at 5 mg/day (33).
the improvement in fev1 was in the range seen in the adult
studies. all the clinical trials with montelukast were done
with bedtime dosing. nothing is known regarding dosing at
other times of the day.
safety
in general, these drugs appear to be well tolerated.
whether some of these drugs have potential liver toxicity is
not yet clear, but  xxxd3554xxx  has a 3% incidence of elevations in
 xxxg941xxx  versus placebo (24). higher doses
of  xxxd3545xxx  (80 mg bid) likely have a similar effect on
transaminases. no effect has been seen with montelukast.
there is some suggestion that a tachyphylaxis may occur
with some of these compounds, such that higher doses are
needed to maintain effective protection against challenges
such as exercise (34). however, this effect was not seen with
montelukast (16).
because all of these compounds are metabolized by the
liver, the possibility for significant drug interactions with
other drugs metabolized by the p450 enzyme system clearly
exists, but many such interactions, as could occur with antiepileptic drugs, have not yet been reported.  xxxd3545xxx  (and to a
smaller extent,  xxxd3554xxx ) has considerable interaction with warfarin, such that the dose of warfarin would likely have to be cut
by up to 50%.  xxxd3554xxx  is also metabolized via the cytochrome
p450 system, and recommendations for concurrent use with
theophylline suggest decreasing the dose of theophylline by
50% and then checking the theophylline level. in addition,
food appears to interfere with the absorption of  xxxd3545xxx ,
and the drug must be dosed 1 h before or after meals.

of perhaps the greatest concern is the possible association
of  xxxd3545xxx  and montelukast with churg-strauss syndrome, a rare eosinophilic vasculitis. recently, eight patients
treated with  xxxd3545xxx  who had previously been on oral steroids were reported to present with churg-strauss syndrome.
it is currently unclear whether this was a direct causal effect,
or whether the churg-strauss was there previously and unmasked when the steroids were tapered. more information is
needed before conclusions can definitively be drawn, but
physicians should seriously consider complaints regarding
new rashes or neurological or worsening respiratory symptoms (35). whether cases will be reported with  xxxd3554xxx  is not
yet known.
how will these compounds be used
in the treatment of asthma?
as the understanding of the long term efficacy and safety
of these lt modulators improves, our ability to place these
drugs into treatment guidelines will also improve. the initial
evaluation of these drugs by the most recent (1997) national
asthma education program guidelines suggest that ltmodulating drugs may be used as an alternative to inhaled
corticosteroids in the treatment of mild persistent asthma. although this is certainly an option, patients with more severe
disease may also benefit from add-on therapy to low dose inhaled corticosteroids and/or in more severely obstructed patients as an alternative to theophylline or a long-acting
beta-agonist. a distinct advantage of these compounds is the
oral dosing which may make compliance and adherence better, especially in the large percentage of patients who do not
use their inhaled steroids regularly for any number of reasons. these drugs also promise to be very helpful in the treatment of aspirin-sensitive asthmatics. however, further

clinical experience with the long term disease modifying effects of these drugs is necessary before their final place in
asthma treatment is known.
