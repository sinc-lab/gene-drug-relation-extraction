1 the administration of  xxxd990xxx  (1 mg kg-' i.v.) to rats that were pre-loaded 48 h before with
"4c-labelled r- or  xxxd990xxx  caused the plasma levels of these compounds to
increase. this is due to the substitution of the microsomal ( xxxd3522xxx  2,3-epoxide (ko) reductase)
bound r- or s-["4c]-warfarin by the unlabelled 4-hydroxycoumarin administered. the rate of
reappearance was 3-4 fold higher for r- than for  xxxd990xxx ; t1,2 of release: 1.2 + 0.04 and
3.7 + 0.6 h, respectively.
2 liver microsomes prepared from rats pretreated with r- or s-[14c]-warfarin, released these
compounds only in the presence of dithiothreitol (dtt; 10mm). the rate of release was higher for
r- than for  xxxd990xxx -treated microsomes.
3 liver microsomes treated in vitro with r- or s- xxxd59xxx  could be reactivated by dtt
(o1mm). reactivation was higher for the r- than for the s- xxxd59xxx -treated microsomes.
4 the microsomal vitamin ko reductase activity under 'normal' assay conditions ([dtt] = 2 mm)
was as sensitive for r- as for s-4-hydroxycoumarins. at elevated dtt concentrations (= 42 mm) the
rate of vitamin ko conversion was about 1.5 fold higher in the presence of the r-isomers than in the
presence of the s-isomers. for instance, at 2 mm ddt the reductase activities in the presence of
2.6 m r- and  xxxd990xxx  were about 15% of control. at 42mm dtt the activities were 90 and 65%
of control, respectively.
5 in the in vitro experiments  xxxd59xxx  appeared to be more potent than warfarin and phentracer doses (6 yg) of

procoumon.

6 the following mechanism is proposed: vitamin ko reductase becomes oxidized during substrate
reduction. the oxidized (i.e. inactive) form binds equally to the r- and s-enantiomers of 4hydroxycoumarins. the attached (covalently bound?) coumarin is released by the reactivation (i.e.
reduction) of the enzyme. however, the rate of reactivation is strongly attenuated by the attached
coumarin. this effect is more pronounced for the s-configuration of the 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulants.

introduction

the oral anticoagulants of the 3 substituted 4-

hydroxycoumarins ( xxxd59xxx , phenrocoumon,
warfarin, etc.) are in clinical use as racemic mixtures.
for a long time it has been recognized that the
stereochemical enantiomers differ in their pharmacological responses. the s-enantiomers of warfarin
and  xxxd2911xxx  are 2 to 5 times more potent
than their r-enantiomers in man (o'reilly, 1974;
jahnchen et al., 1976; wingard et al., 1978), as well
as in experimental animals (jacobi & levy, 1974;
schmidt & jahnchen, 1977). for  xxxd59xxx , the

opposite is true (meinertz et al., 1978). this difference, however, is a pharmacokinetic related problem.
the s-enantiomer of  xxxd59xxx  is cleared 10
times faster than r- xxxd59xxx  (godbillon et al.,
1981; thijssen et al., 1986a) and close examination
showed that for  xxxd59xxx  the s-enantiomer is
also intrinsically the most potent enantiomer
(thijssen et al., 1985).
the 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulants are
thought to act by inhibiting one or two specific
dithiol-dependent reductases, i.e.  xxxd3522xxx  2,3epoxide (vitamin ko) reductase and  xxxd3522xxx 
reductase, which are an integral part of the vitamin

k cycle in the endoplasmic reticulum of the
hepatocyte (suttie, 1980). the reductase(s) is (are)
believed to contain two sulphhydryl groups in its
active centre which become oxidized to form a disulphide bond during substrate reduction (silverman,
1980; fasco et al., 1983; lee & fasco, 1984).
the reductase(s) can be assayed in in vitro systems,
for instance in liver microsomes, using dithiothreitol
(dtt) as the donor for reducing equivalents. when
tested in such systems, no differences in sensitivity
for r- and  xxxd990xxx  were observed by fasco & coworkers (fasco & principe, 1982; wilson & fasco,
1986). we also found no differences in the id50s of
the r- and s-enantiomers of  xxxd59xxx  and of
 xxxd2911xxx  in in vitro rat liver microsomal
vitamin ko reductase systems (unpublished results).
the inhibition of the reductase(s) has (have) been
described as being essentially irreversible (fasco &
principe, 1982). this conclusion was based on the
observations that the reductase activity of warfarintreated (in vitro or in vivo) microsomes cannot be
reactivated by either wash procedures or dialysis.
however, we recently suggested that the interaction
between the coumarin drugs and vitamin ko
reductase is not irreversible in the strict sense, but in
vivo a dynamic equilibrium exists between release of
the coumarin due to reactivation of the enzyme, and
recomplexation after reoxidation of the enzyme due
to substrate reduction (figure 1) (thijssen & baars,
1987). the model, depicted in figure 1, incorporates
the presence of two forms of vitamin ko reductase;
an active (i.e. reduced, containing two sulphhydryl

groups) and an inactive (i.e. oxidized, containing a
disulphide bound) form. the 4-hydroxycoumarins
are assumed to interact only with the oxidized form
(fasco et al., 1983; thijssen, 1987). the model,
among others, emanated from in vivo experiments in
rats showing that [14c]-warfarin is displaced from
its microsomal binding site (i.e. vitamin ko
reductase) by 4-hydroxycoumarin administration. in
vitro the microsomal bound ["4c]-warfarin was rcleased only in the presence of high amounts of dtt
(thijssen & baars, 1987).
we investigated whether this unique system is also
the basis for the stereoselectivity of the 4hydroxycoumarin activity. the results show that the
reactivation of the vitamin ko reductase-4-hydroxycoumarin complex proceeds faster for the r- than for
the s-configuration.
methods

in vivo displacement experiments
rats were provided with pe-10 catheters in the left
femoral artery and the right femoral vein. the catheters were exteriorized at the neck. the rats were
allowed to recover for at least 2 days. this technique
is routinely used in our laboratory and as judged
from physical examination (i.e. weight gain and
motoric activity) the rats were in good condition.
r-/s-[i14c]-warfarin (2 x 106d.p.m., ca.  xxxd593xxx ) in
saline was administered as a bolus injection via the
femoral vein catheter. blood (100p1) was sampled at
regular time intervals via the arterial catheter. at
48 h, the rats received 1 mgkg 1  xxxd990xxx  i.v. and
the reappearance of r-/s-[14c]-warfarin in blood
was followed. the rate of reappearance was calculated as described previously for racemic [14c]-warfarin (thijssen & baars, 1987). briefly, assuming the
reappearance to be exponential (i.e. first order
process) the plasma r-/s-[14c]-warfarin curve following upon the administration of  xxxd990xxx  is the
result of two log-linear curves; the reappearance or
release curve and the elimination curve. by curve
stripping, i.e. method of residuals (rowland & tozer,
1980), the individual rate constants can be analysed.
to examine the tissue distribution of r-/s-[14c]warfarin and the effect of displacement by  xxxd990xxx 
thereupon, rats were provided with a femoral vein
the
catheter.
[14c]-warfarin enantiomers
(1.5 x 106 d.p.m.) were administered as a bolus injection. twenty-four hours later, control rats received
saline (i.v.), the experimental rats received  xxxd990xxx 
(1 mgkg-' in saline). the r-[14c]-warfarin rats were
killed 3 h later, the s-['4c]-warfarin ones 12 h later.

in vitro experiments

racemic ["4c]-warfarin (46 mci mmol- 1) was
obtained from amersham (the netherlands). the
isolation of its isomers was performed according to
banfield & rowland (1983) with some modifications;
n-t-boc- xxxd2434xxx  (sigma chemicals) was used
instead of n-cbz- xxxd2434xxx  because the diastereoisomers of the former showed a more favourable
chromatographic behaviour on thin layer chromatography (silica-gel t.l.c. plates with concentration
zone; merck, darmstadt, f.r.g.; eluting phase: petroleum ether, ethylacetate, methanol; 75:25:1;
v:v:v). the enantiomers of warfarin were prepared
according to the procedure of west et al. (1961). the
enantiomers of  xxxd59xxx  and of  xxxd2911xxx  were a gift from ciba-geigy ltd. (basel,
switzerland) and hoffmann-la roche (basel,
switzerland), respectively. dithiothreitol (dtt) was
purchased from boehringer (f.r.g.), vitamin ko was
prepared from vitamin k1 (phylloquinone, merck)
according to the procedure of tishler et al. (1940).

liver microsomes were prepared as described previously (thijssen, 1987). microsomal vitamin ko
reductase activity was assayed as described previously (thijssen, 1987), except that vitamin ko
(5mm) in 2% triton-x 100 in tris-hci buffer was
used as a substrate solution. thus, 20ju1 of microsomes (about 0.3mg of protein) and 75pl of buffer
(0.02m tris-hcl, 0.15m kcl, ph 7.4) were mixed in
a reaction vessel. following a 3 min (30'c) preincubation period, dtt, 2ju1 of a 0.1 m solution in tris
buffer, was added and the mixture incubated for
another 3 min. the reaction was started by the addition of 2 y1 of the vitamin ko stock solution and was
stopped by the addition of 0.9 ml of ice-cold isopropanol. extraction and analysis by h.p.l.c. were as
described previously (thijssen, 1987). when following the effects of 4-hydroxycoumarins and of dtt

tissue radioactivity was assayed by liquid scintillation counting. the fraction of radioactivity associated with unchanged warfarin was estimated by the

(thijssen et al., 1985). where appropriate, differences
in results were analysed for significance by student's
unpaired t test; p < 0.05 was taken as being significant.

results
as has been demonstrated previously for racemic
['4c]-warfarin, the administration of a high (macro)
dose of a 4-hydroxycoumarin (here  xxxd990xxx ) to
rats which had received tracer doses of r- or s-["c]warfarin 48 h before caused the plasma levels of
radioactivity to increase immediately. figure 2
shows a typical example of such an experiment. the
radioactivity reappearing in the circulation was more
than 90% intact warfarin. the reappearance of r-/s['4c]-warfarin following the administration of
unlabelled  xxxd990xxx  has to be ascribed to the
replacement of the [14c]-warfarin compounds that
were bound to vitamin ko reductase (thijssen &
baars, 1987; see also figure 1). the experiments
showed r-['4c]-warfarin to be released 3-4 times
faster than the s-enantiomer (figure 2). the halflives of release were 1.2 + 0.04 and 3.7 + 0.6 h
(mean + s.d., n = 4) for r- and s-[`4c]-warfarin,
respectively. the differences were significant,
p <0.001.

the distribution of tracer doses of r- and s-

["4c]-warfarin in the liver and kidney of controls

and  xxxd990xxx -treated rats are presented in table 1.
the times taken for examination were when maximal
displacement effects had occurred, i.e. at 3 h for
r-["4c]-warfarin and at 12h for s-["4c]-warfarin
(see figure 2). in controls differences in the steadystate plasma concentrations between the isomers
were obvious; they were about 2 fold higher for
r-["4c]-warfarin (see also figure 2), and the levels
in liver cytosol were about 3 fold higher for the risomer. microsomes of the r-[14c]-warfarin-treated
rats contained about 45% of the total amount in the
liver, for s-['4c]-warfarin this was about 55%. the
in vivo administration of  xxxd990xxx  (1 mgkg- 1) displaced about 70-75% of the microsomal bound rand s-["4c]-warfarin. this resulted in increased
cytosol (3 to 4 fold) and plasma levels. the latter was
more pronounced for s-["4c] warfarin (13 fold) than
for r-["4c]-warfarin (5 to 6 fold). on the whole,
however, no gross differences between the distributions of r- and  xxxd990xxx  in the liver were observed,
either in the control or in the experimental group.
for non-hepatic tissue, like kidney, a displacment of
the r-/s-["4c]-warfarin content was also observed
(table 1).
the control microsomes of the foregoing experiment were used to investigate the in vitro release of
microsomal bound r-/s-[r4c]-warfarin. the results
(table 2) show hardly any release of radioactivity by
mere dilution of the microsomes. in the presence of
dtt (10mm), however, microsomal bound ['4c]warfarin was released in a time-dependent manner
and this was more pronounced for the r- than for
the s-enantiomer of warfarin (table 2).

the amount released due to dtt treatment was obtained by subtracting blank (buffer) values.

somal bound 4-hydroxycoumarin was associated
with reactivation of the vitamin ko reductase activity. r- and s- xxxd59xxx  were used as the
reductase inactivators. as can be seen, dtt (10mm)
treatment for 1 h resulted in some reactivation of the
reductase activity and this was more pronounced for
the r- xxxd59xxx -treated microsomes (about 2
fold more).
the results of in vivo experiments (figure 2) suggested that the mechanism of stereoselectivity of the
4-hydroxycoumarins is linked to the reactivation of
the oxidized enzyme-4-hydroxycoumarin complex
(step 4, figure 1). the data from in vitro experiments
(tables 2 and 3) are in agreement with this.
however, the in vitro results were not as dramatic as
expected. we, therefore, studied the effect of time on
microsomal vitamin ko reductase activity and investigated the effect of 4-hydroxycoumarin enantiomers
and the effect of dtt thereupon. figure 3 shows the
results from a typical experiment in which the effects
of r-/s- xxxd59xxx  (2.3pm) and r-/ xxxd990xxx 
(2.6 pm) on microsomal vitamin ko reductase activity
were investigated. at a dtt concentration (2mm)
optimal for the control reaction (km of dtt at the
vitamin ko concentration used is about 0.2 mm; own
observation and that of others), no differences in
reductase activity were observed for the r- and si4
hydroxycoumarin-treated microsomes (incubation
time 0-20 min). following the addition of extra dtt
(final concentration 42mm) the rate of the vitamin
ko conversion in the 4-hydroxycoumarin-treated
microsomes increased drastically. the final reductase
rates obtained were higher for the microsomes
treated with the r-coumarins. the reductase activity
of the control microsomes was not affected by the
addition of dtt (figure 3). the observed ratios
between the r- and s-isomers for the vitamin ko
reductase activity in the presence of 42mm dtt
were (mean + s.d.): 1.53 짹 0.06 (n = 3, significantly
different from 1, p < 0.01), 1.40 0.1 (n = 3, signifi-

cantly different from 1, p < 0.05), and 1.3 (n = 1) for
 xxxd59xxx , warfarin and  xxxd2911xxx ,
respectively.
two other facts became apparent from these
experiments: (1) the inhibition can be reversed completely by increasing the amount of dtt in the reaction mixture (figure 3). n.b.: no vitamin ko
conversion was ever observed in the absence of
microsomes or in the presence of denaturated
(10 min, 100c) microsomes; (2) the 4hydroxycoumarin congeners are not equipotent, i.e.
 xxxd59xxx  was more potent than warfarin (see
figure 3).  xxxd2911xxx  and warfarin were equipotent.

discussion
in a recent paper (thijssen & baars, 1987) we proposed that the tight complex between 4hydroxycoumarins and the oxidized (i.e. inactive)
form of the enzyme vitamin ko reductase dissociates
following reduction (i.e. reactivation) of the disulphidebondintheactivecentreoftheenzyme.therate
of reduction of the disulphide bond of the 'susceptible'
with 4enzyme is low when complexed

hydroxycoumarin, thus explaining the mechanism of
action ofthe oral anticoagulants (figure 1). support for
this model is given by the mechanism on which the
4-hydroxycoumarin resistance of the scottish warfarin
resistant genotype is based. the oxidized vitamin ko
reductase ofthis resistant strain, notwithstanding that a
4-hydroxycoumarin is tightly (irreversibly) complexed
with it, has been shown to undergo reactivation and
thereby to release the coumarin under relatively mild
reducing (i.e. 2 mm dtt) conditions (thijssen, 1987).
thus, the reactivation of an enzyme of this genotype is
hardly retarded in the presence of the classical 4hydroxycoumarins, which explains the resistance to
these drugs.
with this model in mind, it seemed obvious to
investigate the reactivation pathway (step 4, figure
1) as the possible basis for the stereoselectivity of the
4-hydroxycoumarins. the displacing experiments
showed that the in vivo rate of reactivation of the
oxidized vitamin ko reductase-warfarin complex was
3 to 4 times faster for the r-warfarin-enzyme
complex. the results from in vitro experiments
demonstrated basically the same characteristics, a
higher rate of release (table 2) and a higher rate of
reactivation (table 3, figure 3) for the r-4hydroxycoumarin-enzyme complex. the differences
between the r- and s-enantiomers in the in vitro
experiments, however, were not as high as was
observed for the in vivo displacement experiments.
one reason could be that the endogenous reductor is
more selective for stereochemical configurations.
another reason could be that the association rate
between the 4-hydroxycoumarin and the oxidized
enzyme (step 3, figure 1) exhibits stereoselectivity.
however, computer simulations of the model (figure
1) showed that step 3 is of little influence on the
steady-state level of active enzyme as long as its rate
is not low in comparison to step 2 (unpublished
results).
besides the stereoselectivity, the model also
explains the higher r-warfarin liver cytosol and
plasma levels (table 1); i.e. the higher rate of reactivation of the enzyme-r-warfarin complex (step 4,
figure 1) assures a higher 'free' r-warfarin steadystate level. also the observation that rat liver microsomal  xxxd3522xxx  and vitamin ko reductase activity
recovered more quickly from the r-warfarin administration than from the  xxxd990xxx  administration, in
vivo, (fasco & principe, 1982) can be explained by
this model.
however, the kind of the interaction between the
4-hydroxycoumarins and the oxidized vitamin ko
reductase is still speculative. the irreversible character of the complex suggests a covalent bond. apparently this bond is reversed by the reductor (dtt)
without destruction of the coumarin. this and the
fact that the 4-hydroxycoumarins interact only with

4-hydroxycoumarin stereoselectivity

the oxidized enzyme might point to a chemical interaction, possibly with the disulphide bond of the
enzyme. in the literature many authors still share the
view that  xxxd3522xxx  (ko) and the 4hydroxycoumarins are structurally related and the
absence of any competition between the substances
is therefore surprising. however, we recently made
the observation that the 4-hydroxycoumarins, unlike
 xxxd3522xxx  and vitamin ko, did not give a signal at
reductive conditions (up to -1.6 v) in an electrochemical h.p.l.c. cell, but strongly responded at oxidative conditions (1/2e,,1 = 0.5v) (unpublished
results). principally these results show the absence of
any relationship between  xxxd3522xxx  and the 4hydroxycoumarins. although not conclusive, we also
feel that these data support our hypothesis with
regard to the interaction mechanism.
the fact that r-/s-[14c]-warfarin in kidneys
responded similarly, to the administration of a
'macro' dose of  xxxd990xxx  (displacer), to liver tissue
is in agreement with our earlier findings showing
that extrahepatic tissues, like the kidney, possess
vitamin ko reductase activity (thijssen et al., 1986b).
the discussion so far has been conducted on the
following assumption: (1) vitamin ko reductase
switches from a reduced (active) form to an oxidized
(inactive) form during substrate reduction. reactivation needs a reductor and in in vitro systems dtt
serves that purpose. the presence of two active site
sulphhydryl groups which are converted to a disulphide fit into this mechanistic model. (2) the 4hydroxycoumarins interact with the oxidized
enzyme. this hypothesis, first formulated by fasco et
al. (1983) is based on the observation that following
dtt pretreatment the initial velocity of microsomal
vitamin ko reduction is insensitive to 4hydroxycoumarin inhibition. in accordance with this
finding are recent observations in our laboratory
which show that the saturable microsomal [14c]warfarin binding is abolished by pretreatment with
dtt (results to be published elsewhere).

however, silverman & coworkers (1988) have
recently questioned the presence of active site sulphhydryl groups. experiments with solubilized
bovine microsomes showed that the inhibitory effect
of thiol blocking agents on vitamin ko reductase
activity is independent of dtt pretreatment. these
and other results led silverman et al. (1988) to postulate an alternative mechanism for vitamin ko
reduction, instead of acting as a reducing agent dtt
is a substrate for the reductase. dtt binding induces
a conformational change which activates the enzyme
and so assumes the proper alignment of vitamin ko,
the dithiol and a functional group on the enzyme.
the dithiol is the electron donor for the reduction.
this model will explain the present results as well as
the assumption that 4-hydroxycoumarins interact
only with the inactive enzyme, i.e. in the absence of
the dithiol substrate, and that this interaction is
somehow irreversible. the 4-hydroxycoumarin
binding stereoselectively reduces the interaction i.e.
affinity, of the dithiol with its binding site. however,
once dtt binding is accomplished, the resulting
conformational change will cause the release of the
4-hydroxycoumarin.
the competition described between 4hydroxycoumarins and dtt (silverman et al., 1988)
is not compatible with this extension of the model.
competition in the strict sense presumes an interaction equilibrium for the 4-hydroxycoumarins.
however, all data up to now refute such an equilibrium (fasco & principe, 1982; thijssen, 1987;
thijssen & baars, 1987). hence, it remains to be
determined whether the observed apparent competition is inherent in the model presented in figure
1; i.e. whether a competitive interaction occurs
between the dtt or 4-hydroxycoumarin concentration-dependent rates of steps 2 and 3, respectively.
as well as the purification of vitamin ko
reductase, knowledge of the endogenous reductor
will enlarge our understanding of the system and the
mechanism of 4-hydroxycoumarin inhibition.
