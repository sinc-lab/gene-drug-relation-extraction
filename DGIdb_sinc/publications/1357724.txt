introduction
 xxxd3255xxx 
is an antiinflammatory
agent that has been widely used in the treatment
of ulcerative colitis or inflammatory
bowel disease (ibd) for more than 30 years (1). more
recently,
its mechanism
of action has been related
to an inhibition
of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism similar to that observed with other salicylates.
in particular,
both  xxxd3255xxx 
and its intestinal metabolite,
5-aminosalicylic
acid, have been shown to weakly inhibit the
 xxxg147xxx 
pathway
at low millimolar
concentrations
(2.3).
in the present study, we
report the effects
of  xxxd3255xxx 
and its major metabolites
on lyso-paf:acetyl-coa
acetyltransferase,
the enzyme whrch synthesizes platelet-activating
factor (paf) in response
to inflammatory
stimuli (4).

as shown in figure 1,  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited the enzymatic synthesis of paf in rat
pleural cell lysates with an icso of 0.05 mm. in this system, paf synthesis was completely
inhibited at concentrations
of 0.3 mm and above. the major metabolites of  xxxd3255xxx ,

were weak inhibitors
of lyso-paf:acetyl-coa

in these
experiments, control values for  xxxg147xxx  activity, measured as dpm ( t 5.e.m.) in the

preincubation
with  xxxd3255xxx , control values were much lower (3876 + 439). however,
the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd3255xxx  was not significantly
changed.

discussion
synthesis of paf in various tissues has been shown to occur via two distinct enzymatic
pathways (7.8) -- [l] the de nouo pathway, analogous to synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, in
which acetylation of an alkyl-phospholipid
occurs prior to the sequential removal of
phosphate and interaction with cdp-choline and [2] the remodeling pathway in which
stimulation of a  xxxg1759xxx  produces lyso-paf from alkyl choline phosphoglycerides.
lyso-paf is then acetylated by iyso-paf:acetyl-coa acetyltransferase
to form paf. the
 xxxd208xxx  also released as a product of  xxxg1759xxx  activation may be further
metabolized by  xxxd208xxx  cyclooxygenase and iipoxygenases. it has been suggested that
the de nmm pathway serves to maintain normal endogenous levels of paf, while the
remodeling pathway is thought to be stimulated during proinflammatory
and ischemic
responses (4).
in earlier studies, stenson and lobos (2) and nielson, et al. (3) showed that
 xxxd3255xxx  and 5- xxxd153xxx  inhibit  xxxg147xxx  in human polymorphonuclear
leukocytes at low millimolar concentrations similar to those found to inhibit the enzyme of
rat neutrophils in the present study. their findings supported the use of 5- xxxd153xxx 
as a substitute for its parent,  xxxd3255xxx , in the treatment of bowel disease. others(g)
have reported that  xxxd3255xxx  and both of its metabolites, at concentrations of 0.5 mm
and higher, have radical scavenging effects, which may contribute to anti-inflammatory
actions.

our data indicate
that  xxxd3255xxx 
is more potent
than its metabolites,
as an
inhibitor of the enzymatic
pathway
leading to paf synthesis in response to inflammatory
stimuli. this is consistent with speculations and some clinical evidence supportrng a possible
therapeutic
advantage
for  xxxd3255xxx 
over its metabolites
(15).
an inhibition
of
lyso-paf:acetyl-coa

by  xxxd3255xxx 
may also contribute
to its beneficial
clinical effects recently reported in psoriaticand
rheumatoid
arthritis(l6.17).
