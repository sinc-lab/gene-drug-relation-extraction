ca2⫹ influx via voltage-dependent l-type ca2⫹ channels
(␣1c,  xxxg304xxx ) in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle initiates
contractions and contributes to timing of the cardiac action
potential (bers and perez-reyes, 1999).  xxxg304xxx  is sensitive to
block by three distinct chemical classes of small-molecule
drugs: dihydropyridines (dhps), phenylalkylamines (paas),
and benzothiazepines (bzps) (hockerman et al., 1997b).
these drugs possess vasodilatory activity and are used to
treat hypertension and angina pectoris (fleckenstein and
fleckenstein-grun, 1980). the  xxxg304xxx  channel is a heteromultimer composed of a pore-forming ␣1 subunit and regulatory ␤ and ␣2␦ subunits (jones, 1998). the ␣1 subunit is
composed of four homologous domains (i–iv), each of which
includes six transmembrane segments (s1–s6) (tanabe et
al., 1987). each domain also includes a pore-lining region
between segments 5 and 6, containing a conserved motif that
features a glu residue (ei, eii, eiii, eiv) that contributes to

however, all of the pore-region mutations abolished ca2⫹ potentiation of verapamil block at 0.05 hz. the t1116a, f1117g,
e1118q, and e1419q mutations all significantly reduced frequency-dependent verapamil block (1-hz stimulation) in both
ba2⫹ and ca2⫹. the i1627a mutation, which disrupts ca2⫹dependent inactivation, increased the fraction of closed channels blocked by 30 ␮m verapamil in ba2⫹ but did not affect
frequency-dependent block in ba2⫹ or ca2⫹. our data suggest
that the pore region of domain iii may contribute to a high
affinity verapamil binding site accessed during 1-hz stimulation
and that ca2⫹ binding to multiple sites may be required for
potentiation of verapamil block of closed channels.

the ca2⫹ selectivity filter (yang et al., 1993). the large,
intracellular c-terminal tail also contains an iq calmodulin
binding motif that is critical for the acceleration of the inactivation rate in ca2⫹ relative to ba2⫹ (i.e., ca2⫹-dependent
inactivation) (peterson et al., 1999; zuhlke et al., 1999).

1996). quaternary amine derivatives of verapamil and methoxyverapamil block  xxxg304xxx  channels in smooth muscle cells
only when applied to the intracellular side of the membrane,
whereas a quaternary amine derivative of desmethoxyverapmil blocks  xxxg304xxx  from either side of the membrane (berjukov et al., 1996). block of closed channels by desmethoxyverapamil involves specific amino acid residues in
transmembrane segments iiis6 and ivs6 that are unique to
l-type channels (hockerman et al., 1995, 1997a; doring et
al., 1996). paas preferentially block  xxxg304xxx  channels undergoing high-frequency depolarizations, a property called frequency-dependent block (lee and tsien, 1983), which is the
result of a higher drug affinity for the inactivated state of the
channel (johnson et al., 1996; nawrath and wegener, 1997).

abstract
verapamil block of  xxxg304xxx  is frequency-dependent and potentiated by ca2⫹. we examined the molecular determinants of
these characteristics using mutations that effect ca2⫹ interactions with  xxxg304xxx . mutant and wild-type  xxxg304xxx  channels were
transiently expressed in tsa 201 cells with ␤1b and ␣2␦ subunits. the four conserved glutamates that compose the ca2⫹
selectivity filter in  xxxg304xxx  were mutated to gln (e363q, e709q,
e1118q, e1419q) and the adjacent conserved threonine in
each domain was mutated to ala (t361a, t707a, t1116a,
t1417a). the l-type-specific residues in the domain iii pore
region (f1117g) and the c-terminal tail (i1627a) were also
mutated and assayed for block by verapamil using whole-cell
voltage-clamp recordings in 10 mm ba2⫹ or 10 mm ca2⫹. in
ba2⫹, none of the pore-region mutations reduced the fraction

materials and methods
construction of wild-type and mutant ca2ⴙ channels. the
 xxxg304xxx  (snutch et al., 1991) and mutant channels were subcloned
into pcdna3 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). mutations were introduced
as described previously (hockerman et al., 1997a) or using a modification of the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis procedure
(stratagene, la jolla, ca). the desired mutations were verified and
the integrity of the clones was confirmed by cdna sequencing and
extensive restriction digest analysis.
cell culture. human tsa 201 cells, a simian virus 40 t-antigenexpressing derivative of human embryonic kidney 293 cells, were
maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/nutrient mixture f-12 (invitrogen) enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum.
expression of ca2ⴙ channels. human tsa 201 cells were cotransfected with wt and mutant  xxxg304xxx  ␣1 subunits, ␤1b (pragnell et

al., 1991) and ␣2␦ (ellis et al., 1988), and enhanced green fluorescent
protein (gfp) (bd biosciences clontech, palo alto, ca) such that the
molar ratio of the plasmids was 1:1:1:0.8. cells were transfected
using lipofectamine 2000 per the manufacturer’s protocol (invitrogen); cells were replated at low density for electrophysiological recording 20 to 24 h after transfection. experiments were conducted 20
to 48 h after replating.
electrophysiology. transfected cells were recognized by gfp
fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation at 480 nm. barium and
calcium currents through ca2⫹ channels were recorded using the
whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. patch electrodes were pulled from vwr micropipettes (vwr, west chester,
pa) and fire-polished to produce an inner tip diameter of 4 to 6 ␮m.
currents were recorded using an axopatch 200b patch-clamp amplifier (axon instruments inc., union city, ca) and filtered at 1 or 2
khz (six-pole bessel filter, ⫺3 db). voltage pulses were applied and
data were acquired using pclamp8 software (axon instruments
inc.). voltage-dependent leak currents were subtracted using an
on-line p/⫺4 subtraction paradigm. verapamil, dissolved in bath
saline, was applied to cells using an rsc 160 fast perfusion system
(bio-logic, claix, france) with constant exchange of the bath solution. iba current was measured in the bath saline containing tris
(150 mm), mgcl2 (4 mm), and bacl2 (10 mm). ica current was
measured in the same bath solution, except that ca2⫹ (10 mm)
replaced ba2⫹. the intracellular saline buffer contained n-methyld-glucamine (130 mm), egta (10 mm), hepes (60 mm), mgatp
(2 mm), and mgcl2 (1 mm). (⫾)-verapamil (sigma/rbi, natick, ma)
concentrations were made from 100 mm stock solution in 70% ethanol. the ph of both solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with  xxxd390xxx  acid. all experiments were performed at room temperature
(20–23°c).
data analysis. data were analyzed using clampfit (axon instruments, inc.) and sigmaplot and sigmastat software (spss inc.,
chicago, il).

results
frequency-dependent drug block and ca2ⴙ potentiation of drug block in  xxxg304xxx  channels. previous studies (lee and tsien, 1983) demonstrated that bzps and paas,
but not dhps, show frequency-dependent block properties.
frequency-dependent block of the dhp  xxxd2718xxx , the bzp
diltiazem, and the paa verapamil was assessed in our experimental system (fig. 1a). verapamil and diltiazem show
strong frequency-dependent block of  xxxg304xxx  channels,
whereas the charged dhp  xxxd2718xxx  does not. frequencydependent drug block was measured in the presence of approximately ic50 concentrations of the indicated drugs in 10
mm ba2⫹. whole-cell currents through wt  xxxg304xxx  channels
were measured using 100-ms depolarizations to ⫹10 mv
from a holding potential of ⫺60 mv in the absence or presence of the indicated drug concentrations at 0.05 hz. in cells
to which drug was applied, block was allowed to reach equilibrium for several minutes at 0.05-hz stimulation. the stimulation frequency was then increased to 1 hz for 20 pulses.
this procedure was applied in all subsequent experiments
measuring frequency-dependent drug block.
block of dhps, bzps, and paas is also potentiated by
ca2⫹ (lee and tsien, 1983). that is, the same concentration
of drug will block a larger fraction of  xxxg304xxx  channels when
ca2⫹, rather than ba2⫹, is used as the charge carrier. figure
1b shows ca2⫹ potentiation of 30 ␮m verapamil block of wt
 xxxg304xxx . to determine ca2⫹ potentiation of drug block, closedchannel block was measured as described at 0.05 hz in 10
mm ba2⫹ or 10 mm ca2⫹. verapamil (30 ␮m) blocked a

verapamil is not highly selective for l-type channels, because  xxxg304xxx ,  xxxg302xxx , and cav2.3 channels show little difference in sensitivity to verapamil (cai et al., 1997). thus, the
binding site for paas may be substantially conserved across
voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels. indeed, mutation of two of the
conserved glu residues to gln in the selectivity filter of
 xxxg304xxx  (eiiiq or eivq) reduces the affinity of desmethoxyverapamil for closed channels in ba2⫹ (hockerman et
al., 1997a). we assayed  xxxg304xxx  channels in which the conserved glu residues were mutated to gln [e363q (eiq),
e709q (eiiq), e1118q (eiiiq), e1419q (eivq)], or the adjacent conserved thr residues to ala [t361a (tia), t707a
(tiia), t1116a (tiiia), t1417a (tiva)] for closed-channel
block and frequency-dependent block by verapamil in ba2⫹.
we found that none of the mutants tested significantly reduced the sensitivity of closed channels to block by verapamil
but that eiiiq, eivq, and tiiia displayed a significantly
lower extent of frequency-dependent block than did wt
 xxxg304xxx .
the conserved glu residues that compose the selectivity
filter of  xxxg304xxx  bind ca2⫹ ions as they pass through the
channel pore, thus largely excluding monovalent cations
when ca2⫹ ions are present (yang et al., 1993). however, the
ba2⫹ conductance of  xxxg304xxx  is higher than that for ca2⫹
because ca2⫹ binds more tightly to the pore glu residues
(almers and mccleskey, 1984). ca2⫹ binding by  xxxg304xxx  also
modulates drug binding. all three chemical classes of l-type
ca2⫹ channel blockers are more potent when ca2⫹, rather
than ba2⫹, is used as the charge carrier (lee and tsien,
1983). the conserved glu residues in domains iii and iv, as
well as an adjacent phe residue in the pore region of domain
iii in  xxxg310xxx , mediate the ca2⫹ potentiation of dhp (peterson and catterall, 1995) and diltiazem affinity (dilmac et al.,
2003). furthermore, the iq domain mutant i1627a potentiates diltiazem block of closed channels in ba2⫹, and ca2⫹dependent inactivation is not required for ca2⫹ potentiation
of diltiazem block (dilmac et al., 2003). we report here that
ca2⫹ potentiation of verapamil block of closed  xxxg304xxx  channels is disrupted by any of the eq or ta mutations. furthermore, frequency-dependent block of  xxxg304xxx  by verapamil in
either ba2⫹ or ca2⫹ is also reduced in mutants with single
amino acid substitutions at three adjacent positions in domain iii (tiiia, f1117g, eiiiq) and in eivq. the c-terminal tail mutant i1627a increased the sensitivity of closed
 xxxg304xxx  channels to block by verapamil in ba2⫹ but did not
affect frequency-dependent block in either ba2⫹ or ca2⫹.

fig. 1. calcium potentiation of verapamil block and frequency dependence of block of wt  xxxg304xxx  by structurally distinct drugs. a, frequencydependent block of wt channels by approximately ic50 concentrations of
the calcium channel blockers. frequency-dependent block of wt channels was measured in the absence (closed symbols) or presence (open
symbols) of 500 nm  xxxd2718xxx , 50 ␮m diltiazem, and 30 ␮m verapamil.
a frequency-dependent protocol was applied in which cells were depolarized from a holding potential of ⫺60 mv to ⫹10 mv for 100 ms every
second. note that, although  xxxd2718xxx  (charged dhp) did not show any
frequency-dependent block accumulation, diltiazem (bzp) and verapamil
(paa) showed significant frequency-dependent drug block accumulation
at the end of a 20-pulse stimulation. block was brought to equilibrium
with the indicated concentration of each drug at 0.05 hz followed by a
20-pulse train of depolarizations given at 1 hz. the asterisks indicate
significant differences between the current remaining at the end of the
train in the absence and presence of diltiazem or verapamil. b, verapamil

verapamil and ca2⫹ ions. it is proposed that the negatively
charged glu1118 and glu1419 residues may interact with
the positively charged paa desmethoxyverapamil via electrostatic interactions (hockerman et al., 1997a). we also
mutated the four highly conserved threonine residues adjacent to the critical glu residues. these hydrophilic residues
are conserved across all high-voltage-activated ca2⫹ channels and are invariably located two positions upstream of the
conserved glu residues in each domain. therefore, we singly
mutated amino acids thr361, thr707, thr1116, and thr1417
to ala (tia, tiia, tiiia, and tiva). in addition, we studied
a mutant in which the l-type-specific residue in domain iii,
phe1117, was mutated to gly (f1117g). we previously demonstrated that the f1117g mutant disrupts frequency dependence and ca2⫹ potentiation of  xxxg304xxx  by diltiazem (dilmac
et al., 2003). finally we studied the iq motif mutant, i1627a,
in the c-terminal tail of  xxxg304xxx , because we previously reported that this mutant increases the affinity of the channel
for diltiazem. of all of these mutants, only tia did not
express functional channels.

␤1b, and gfp in tsa 201 cells by transient transfection.
forty-eight hours after transfection, whole-cell ba2⫹ currents were measured in cells expressing the gfp marker.

frequency dependence and ca2⫹ potentiation, are reconstituted in our experimental system.

the mutations in the pore region and c-terminal tail of
l-type  xxxg304xxx  channels used in this study are indicated and

mutants at each of the four highly conserved glutamates that
form the selectivity filter. negatively charged glu residues
were replaced with neutral gln residues, individually, at the
positions e363q, e709q, e1118q, and e1419q (eiq, eiiq,
eiiiq, and eivq) in each domain. note that the structure of
verapamil includes a tertiary amino group that is predominantly charged at physiological ph and could potentially
interact with the acidic glu side chains (fig. 2c). replacing
glutamates with glutamines could potentially disrupt electrostatic interactions between the pore glutamates and both

closed-channel block was measured from a holding potential
of ⫺60 mv using 100-ms depolarization to ⫹10 mv at a
frequency of 0.05 hz. increasing concentrations of verapamil
(1, 5, 10, 50, or 100 ␮m) were applied to cells under voltage
clamp. representative traces recorded from wt in increasing
verapamil concentrations in ba2⫹ are shown in fig. 3a. drug
block was brought to equilibrium for each dose, and current
amplitude in the presence of drug was normalized to current
amplitude in the absence of drug (fig. 3b). normalized current amplitudes at each verapamil concentration for several
cells were averaged and plotted against drug concentration
(fig. 3b, inset). the verapamil ic50 value for wt was 40.5 ⫾
0.9 ␮m. the ic50 value for eiq was not significantly different
from that for wt channels (data not shown). figure 3c shows
the percentage of control current amplitude remaining for
wt  xxxg304xxx  and each of the eq mutants in 30 ␮m verapamil
at 0.05 hz. the percentage of current remaining for all eq
mutants was not significantly different from that of wt
 xxxg304xxx . thus, the mutation of any of the conserved glutamate
residues does not change the sensitivity of the channel to
closed-channel block by verapamil.
frequency-dependent block of glu-to-gln mutants
in ba2ⴙ. although none of the glu-to-gln mutants affected
verapamil block of closed channels, we examined each mutant for frequency-dependent block by verapamil. current
was measured in the absence and presence of 30 ␮m verapamil in 10 mm ba2⫹. in the presence of drug, block was
brought to equilibrium at 0.05 hz followed by a train of 20
depolarizations at 1 hz as described for fig. 1. the peak
amplitudes of the resulting current traces were normalized to
the peak amplitude of pulse 1 of the 20-pulse train, and the
averaged data were plotted against pulse number. mutation
of the conserved glutamate residues exhibited distinct effects
on the frequency-dependent block of verapamil. although
eiq and eiiq did not significantly affect frequency-dependent block (fig. 4a), accumulation of frequency-dependent
block by verapamil was significantly reduced in eiiiq and
eivq (fig. 4, b and c).
ca2ⴙ potentiaion of verapamil block in wt and eq
mutants. we next assessed verapamil block of wt  xxxg304xxx 
and the glu-to-gln mutant channels using 10 mm ca2⫹ as
the charge carrier. first, we measured the percentage of
control current remaining in the presence of 30 ␮m verapamil at 0.05 hz (closed-channel block) and compared these
values for each channel to those measured in 10 mm ba2⫹
(fig. 5a). verapamil block of wt  xxxg304xxx  was potentiated in
ca2⫹ relative to ba2⫹ such that only 37.8 ⫾ 1.5% of current
remained in the presence of 30 ␮m verapamil in 10 mm
ca2⫹, whereas 58.6 ⫾ 2.6% of current remained in 10 mm
ba2⫹. in contrast, the percentage of current remaining in the
presence of 30 ␮m verapamil was not different in 10 mm
ba2⫹ or 10 mm ca2⫹ in each of the glu-to-gln mutants.
thus, ca2⫹ potentiation of verapamil block was eliminated in
all of the glu-to-gln mutants, indicating that neutralization
of any of the selectivity filter glu residues uncouples ca2⫹
binding from an increase in verapamil affinity.
we also examined frequency-dependent verapamil block in
the  xxxg304xxx  wt and glu-to-gln mutations using 10 mm ca2⫹
as the charge carrier (fig. 5, b and c). as we observed in
ba2⫹, the eiq and eiiq mutants were not different from wt
 xxxg304xxx  in the extent of verapamil block accumulation by the
end of a 1-hz, 20-pulse train of depolarizations. however, the

verapamil blocks  xxxg304xxx  channels with higher affinity at
depolarized potentials. as shown in fig. 7, a and b, even
after bringing current to steady state in the presence of 30
␮m verapamil with depolarizations to ⫹10 mv at 0.05 hz,
both wt and eiiiq channels are rapidly and completely
blocked during a 1-s depolarization to ⫹10 mv. we compared
the rate of current decay during a 1-s depolarization to ⫹10
mv, from a holding potential of ⫺60 mv, in the absence or
presence of 30 ␮m verapamil for the wt and eiiiq channels.
current traces were normalized to peak current and fit with
a double-exponential function. in the absence of drug (fig.

with virtually identical fast and slow time constants, and
fractions of channels inactivating with each time constant

presence of 30 ␮m verapamil (fig. 7b, open bars), wt and
eiiiq channel inactivation followed a single time constant
and was virtually complete (wt: ␶ ⫽ 0.29 ⫾ 0.02 s, f ⫽ 1.02 ⫾
0.02; eiiiq ␶ ⫽ 0.21 ⫾ 0.02 s, f ⫽ 1.05 ⫾ 0.01 s). thus, in both
wt and eiiiq channels, 30 ␮m verapamil blocks virtually all
channels with a time course that resembles the fast-inactivating state, leading to complete inactivation by the end of a
1-s depolarization.
effect of the f1117g and i1627a mutants on closedchannel and frequency-dependent block. because
both phe1117 and ile1627 have been implicated in modulation of  xxxg304xxx  channel function by ca2⫹ (peterson and catterall, 1995; zuhlke et al., 1999), we examined their roles in
both ca2⫹ potentiation and frequency dependence of verapamil block. block of closed f1117g and i1627a channels
was measured at 0.05 hz in 30 ␮m verapamil in ba2⫹ or
ca2⫹ (fig. 8a). like the conserved pore glutamate mutants,
the f1117g mutant disrupted ca2⫹ potentiation of verapamil block such that current remaining in the presence of 30
␮m verapamil was the same whether ca2⫹ or ba2⫹ was the
charge carrier. likewise, the extent of closed-channel verapamil block of the i1627a mutant was not different when
measured in ba2⫹ or ca2⫹ from a holding potential of ⫺60
mv. however, the percentage of i1627a current remaining in
the presence of 30 ␮m verapamil in either ba2⫹ or ca2⫹ was
not different from that of wt in ca2⫹. from a holding potential of ⫺80 mv, the percentage of i1627a current remaining
in 30 ␮m verapamil was not different from that of wt in
either ba2⫹ (70.1 ⫾ 4.7) or ca2⫹ (71.0 ⫾ 2.4). frequencydependent block was measured in ba2⫹ and ca2⫹ in 30 ␮m
verapamil at 1 hz as described in figs. 4 and 5. although the
i1627a mutant did not significantly affect accumulation of
frequency-dependent block in either ba2⫹ or ca2⫹, the
f1117g mutant significantly reduced frequency-dependent
block by verapamil at the end of a 20-pulse, 1-hz train of
depolarizations in either ba2⫹ or ca2⫹ (fig. 8, b and c).
thus, whereas f1117g disrupts both ca2⫹ potentiation and
frequency dependence of verapamil block, i1627a enhances
closed-channel verapamil block in ba2⫹ to the level of that
seen in ca2⫹ with wt  xxxg304xxx .
to better understand the basis for the observed differences
in verapamil block of f1117g and i1627a, we measured the
voltage dependence of inactivation for these two mutants in

eiiiq and eivq mutations both exhibited less accumulation
of verapamil block under the same conditions. surprisingly,
we also observed that the extent of frequency-dependent
verapamil block was not significantly different in the wt
 xxxg304xxx  channel whether we used 10 mm ba2⫹ (23 ⫾ 1.6%
current remaining) or 10 mm ca2⫹ (19 ⫾ 2.0%; p ⫽ 0.09) as
the charge carrier (see figs. 4 and 5).
kinetic analysis of depolarized channel block of
wt and eiiiq. to better understand the reduction in the
frequency-dependent block of eiiiq by verapamil, we compared the verapamil modulation of the voltage dependence
and kinetics of inactivation in wt and eiiiq. the voltage
dependence of steady-state inactivation of wt and eiiiq
channels was measured in the absence and presence of 30
␮m verapamil in ba2⫹ (fig. 6a). from a holding potential of
⫺80 mv, cells were held at the indicated conditioning voltages for 10 s, followed immediately by a 100-ms test pulse to
⫹10 mv. normalized current amplitudes during the test
pulses were plotted against the conditioning voltages. the
data were fit to a boltzman equation, and the voltage at
which half the channels were inactivated during the conditioning pulse (v1/2) was calculated. for wt and eiiiq channels, v1/2 was not significantly different in the absence of
verapamil (⫺13.7 ⫾ 0.5 mv versus ⫺15.9 ⫾ 0.6 mv, respectively). however, the leftward shift in v1/2 induced by 30 ␮m
verapamil was significantly greater in wt channels than in
eiiiq (⫺43.7 ⫾ 0.8 mv versus ⫺32.9 ⫾ 0.4 mv, respectively)
indicating that the eiiiq mutant disrupted verapamil interaction with the inactivated state of the channel.
we also examined the time course of wt and eiiiq channel recovery from depolarized channel verapamil block.
whole-cell ba2⫹ current was equilibrated with 30 ␮m verapamil using 100-ms depolarizations to ⫹10 mv from a holding potential of ⫺60 mv at 0.05 hz. after the current reached
steady state, a 1-s depolarization to ⫹10 mv was applied in
the continued presence of drug, followed by a return to ⫺60
mv. the recovery of the current after a 1-s depolarization to
⫹10 mv in the presence or absence of drug was measured by
depolarizing cells to ⫹10 mv for 50 ms from ⫺60 mv at
intervals of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, 20, and 30 s. to determine the
fraction of wt and eiiiq channels recovered from verapamil
block, recovered current was expressed as a fraction of the
peak current during the 1-s depolarization, plotted against
recovery interval in the absence or presence of 30 ␮m verapamil, and fit to a double-exponential function (fig. 6, b and
c). the fast phase of recovery from inactivation (i.e., in the
absence of drug) was similar in both wt and eiiiq channels
(wt: ␶fast ⫽ 283 ms, ffast ⫽ 0.60; eiiiq: ␶fast ⫽ 213 ms, ffast ⫽
0.46), whereas the slow phase of recovery was slower for
eiiiq (wt: ␶slow ⫽ 6.88 s; eiiiq: ␶slow ⫽ 16.9 s). for the wt
channel in the presence of 30 ␮m verapamil, both time constants for recovery were increased (wt: ␶fast ⫽ 1.83 s, ␶slow ⫽
41.0; s ffast ⫽ 0.54). for eiiiq, 30 ␮m verapamil slowed the
fast phase of recovery (␶fast ⫽ 1.91 s; ffast ⫽ 0.46), but the time
constant for the slow phase of recovery was actually accelerated in comparison to eiiiq in the absence of drug (␶slow ⫽
8.07 s). thus, our results suggest that the marked decrease in
frequency-dependent block of eiiiq by verapamil compared
with wt could be the result of faster dissociation of verapamil from eiiiq at ⫺60 mv. recovery of current after a 1-s
depolarization to ⫹10 mv for eiiq was not different from

the absence and presence of 30 ␮m verapamil in 10 mm ba2⫹
(fig. 8d). although the v1/2 values in the absence of drug for
both channels were shifted to more negative potentials compared with wt (f1117g, ⫺23.4 ⫾ 0.5 mv; i1627a, ⫺28.4 ⫾
0.8 mv), the leftward shift in the presence of 30 ␮m verapamil was ⬃30 mv for both wt and i1627a channels but
only ⬃12 mv for f1117g. thus, despite the observation that
both mutants cause a leftward shift in v1/2, they are markedly different in the manner in which they interact with
verapamil.
frequency dependence and ca2ⴙ potentiation in
the ta mutants. because mutation of two of the four selectivity filter glu residues and the l-type-specific phe1117
residue markedly reduced frequency dependence and ca2⫹
potentiation of verapamil block, we examined the role of the
adjacent, conserved thr residues in each domain. we found
that mutation of thr361 in domain i to ala is apparently not
tolerated, because neither this single point mutant, nor a
quadruple mutant, with the conserved thr in each domain
changed to ala, yielded functional channels. a hydrogen
bond donor/acceptor in this position may be a critical channel
function because the t361c mutant channel was found to be
functional (wu et al., 2000). closed-channel verapamil block
of tiia, tiiia, and tiva was measured in ba2⫹ and ca2⫹ at
0.05 hz as described above (fig. 9a). the tiia, tiiia, and
tiva mutants did not differ from wt channels in the fraction of current remaining in the presence of 30 ␮m verapamil
when 10 mm ba2⫹ was used as the charge carrier. in ca2⫹,
tiia, tiiia, and tiva were all less sensitive to verapamil
block at 0.05 hz than wt channel (i.e., ca2⫹ potentiation of
verapamil block was disrupted). in ba2⫹, only tiiia among
the ta mutants accumulated significantly less frequencydependent verapamil block at the end of a 20-pulse, 1-hz
train of depolarizations (fig. 9b). in ca2⫹, both tiia and
tiiia significantly reduced the accumulation of verapamil
block at 1 hz (fig. 9c). thus, whereas tiia, tiiia, and tiva
all reduced the sensitivity of closed channels to verapamil in
ca2⫹, only tiia and tiiia disrupted frequency-dependent
block.
inactivation and ion permeability in the thr-to-ala
mutants. since the thr-to-ala mutations had the unexpected effect of disrupting ca2⫹ potentiation of closed-channel verapamil block, we examined the effect of these mutations on ca2⫹ acceleration of inactivation kinetics and ion
permeability. figure 10a shows normalized, averaged cur-

ca2ⴙ and frequency modulation of verapamil block of  xxxg304xxx 

inactivation. furthermore, the tiia and tiiia mutations
mediate an increased permeability of  xxxg304xxx  for ca2⫹ relative to ba2⫹.

discussion
distinct effects of selectivity filter mutants on ca2ⴙ
potentiation of closed-channel block and frequencydependent block
we have shown that mutation of any of the selectivity filter
glutamates does not reduce the sensitivity of  xxxg304xxx  channels
to closed-channel verapamil block in ba2⫹ (fig. 3). in a previous study, eiiiq and eivq increased the ic50 of the nearly
identical compound, desmethoxyverapamil ( xxxd888xxx ), by 15and 20-fold, respectively, at a stimulation frequency of 0.1 hz
in 10 mm ba2⫹.  xxxd888xxx  is more potent than verapamil in
blocking  xxxg304xxx  (hockerman et al., 1995) and binding to
 xxxg310xxx  (goll et al., 1984). a binding site between iiis6 (hockerman et al., 1997a) and ivs6 (hockerman et al., 1995) was
shown to account for the higher affinity of  xxxd888xxx  for  xxxg304xxx  at
low-frequency stimulation. furthermore, mutation of the
three amino acids in ivs6 critical for high-affinity  xxxd888xxx 
block of  xxxg304xxx  did not affect the potency of verapamil block
at 0.1 hz (johnson et al., 1996). thus, the present study
supports previous work suggesting that  xxxd888xxx  and verapamil
interact with distinct binding determinants on closed  xxxg304xxx 
channels (i.e., at low-frequency stimulation).
i1627a is unique among the mutants used in this study
because it is in the cytoplasmic c-terminal tail, not, apparently, in the vicinity of the transmembrane segments com-

verapamil, wt inactivation was single-exponential with a relatively fast time constant (␶f ⫽ 0.29 ⫾ 0.02 s). in the absence of drug, eiiiq channel
inactivation was fit to a double-exponential equation with a fast time constant similar to that of wt channels (␶f ⫽ 0.15 ⫾ 0.06 s; ff ⫽ 0.12 ⫾ 0.04)
and a slow time constant (␶s ⫽ 1.46 ⫾ 0.53 s; fs ⫽ 0.62 ⫾ 0.07). in the presence of 30 ␮m verapamil, eiiiq channels displayed a single fast component

rent traces for wt and the thr-to-ala mutants in 10 mm
ba2⫹ or ca2⫹. we compared the extent of inactivation in
these channels by measuring the percentage of peak current
inactivated at the end of a 1-s depolarization to ⫹10 mv from
a holding potential of ⫺60 mv (fig. 10b). no significant
difference in the extent of inactivation was observed among
wt, tiia, tiiia, tiva, and the domain iii mutant f1117g
in ba2⫹. in ca2⫹, only the tiia mutant exhibited a decrease
in the percentage of current inactivated at 1 s compared with
wt. however, ca2⫹ significantly increased the extent of
inactivation at 1 s compared with ba2⫹ in all three thr-toala mutants (i.e., ca2⫹- dependent inactivation was intact).
we also examined the permeability of the thr-to-ala mutants for ba2⫹ relative to ca2⫹. figure 11a shows whole-cell
currents recorded in the same cell in the presence of 10 mm
ba2⫹ or ca2⫹ in tsa 201 cells expressing wt and the indicated mutant  xxxg304xxx  channels. current was elicited by
100-ms depolarizations to ⫹10 mv at 0.05 hz, from a holding
potential of ⫺60 mv while the extracellular solution was
switched between 10 mm ba2⫹ and 10 mm ca2⫹. with ca2⫹
as the charge carrier, the peak amplitude current measured
in wt and tiva channels was reduced relative to the peak
current measured in ba2⫹. in contrast, the peak current
amplitudes measured in ca2⫹ were greater than those measured in ba2⫹ for the tiia and tiiia mutants. figure 11b
shows the relative change in current amplitude, for each of
the channels tested, upon switching from ba2⫹- to ca2⫹containing extracellular solution. thus, whereas the thr-toala mutations disrupt ca2⫹ potentiation of verapamil block
of closed channels, they do not eliminate ca2⫹-dependent

vation that ca2⫹-dependent inactivation is disrupted in the
eq mutations (dilmac et al., 2003), these results also suggest
that the consequences of ca2⫹-calmodulin binding to the
c-terminal tail of  xxxg304xxx  may include conformational
changes in the pore region of the channel.
ca2⫹ potentiation of closed-channel verapamil block was
disrupted by mutation of any of the glu-to-gln mutants,
f1117g, and all of the thr-to-ala mutants. the modulation
of verapamil block by ca2⫹ is distinct from what we previously observed for diltiazem (dilmac et al., 2003), where
eiiiq, eivq, and f1117g, but not eiq or eiiq, disrupted
ca2⫹ potentiation of closed-channel diltiazem block. however, the effect of the thr-to-ala mutations on this property
of diltiazem block was not examined in that study. similar to
diltiazem, dhps bind in a pocket composed of iiis5, iiis6,
and ivs6 (hockerman et al., 1997c). moreover, ca2⫹ potentiation of dhp binding also requires glu1118, glu1419, and
phe1117 but not glu363 or glu709 (peterson and catterall,
1995). taken together, these data suggest that ca2⫹ binding
to a site in domains iii and iv modulates the diltiazem
(hockerman et al., 2000) and dhp (hockerman et al., 1997c)

posing the small-molecule drug binding sites. however, as we
previously observed with diltiazem (dilmac et al., 2003),
i1627a increased the sensitivity of closed  xxxg304xxx  channels to
verapamil block in ba2⫹, whereas frequency-dependent block
was not different from wt in ba2⫹ or ca2⫹. the i1627a
mutation shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation by
approximately ⫺20 mv compared with wt. because we
found that closed-channel block of i1627a by 30 ␮m verapamil from a holding potential of ⫺80 mv was not different
from that of wt measured from a holding potential of ⫺60
mv, it seems that the increase in sensitivity to verapamil in
i1627a at ⫺60 mv results from the shift in voltage dependence of inactivation. however, ca2⫹ potentiation of closedchannel block of i1627a by verapamil is abolished at both
potentials. these results suggest that ca2⫹-calmodulin binding to the c-terminal iq motif, which is disrupted in i1627a
(zuhlke et al., 1999), may be required for ca2⫹ potentiation
of closed-channel verapamil block. the loss of ca2⫹ potentiation of closed-channel block in all of the eq mutations
suggests that ca2⫹ potentiation also requires ca2⫹ binding
in the channel pore. taken together with our previous obser-

frequency dependence of verapamil block in ba2ⴙ
or ca2ⴙ. in contrast to our results using low-frequency stimulation (0.05 hz), we found that multiple mutations clustered
in the domain iii region of the selectivity filter markedly
disrupted frequency-dependent verapamil block (figs. 4, 5, 8,
and 9). disruption of block was similar whether ba2⫹ or ca2⫹
was used as the charge carrier. surprisingly, we found that,
unlike our previous observations with diltiazem (dilmac et
al., 2003), frequency-dependent block of  xxxg304xxx  is not appreciably potentiated by ca2⫹ in our experimental system. in
addition, the f1117g and eiiiq mutations both significantly
decreased the leftward shift in v1/2 induced by 30 ␮m verapamil [f1117g, ⌬ ⫽ ⬃12 mv (fig. 8d); eiiiq, ⌬ ⫽ ⬃17 mv

frequency-dependent verapamil block in ba2⫹. however, it is
clear that f1117g decreases affinity for verapamil in ca2⫹,
because both the steady-state block determined from a fit of
the data and the current remaining at the 20th pulse are
clearly different from that of wt (fig. 8c). likewise, tiia
disrupts both closed-channel and frequency-dependent verapamil in ca2⫹ but not in ba2⫹ (fig. 9). our data support a
scenario in which frequency-dependent verapamil block of
 xxxg304xxx  channels (i.e., channels in the open and/or inactivated
state) involves binding to a site that includes thr1116,
f1117g, glu1118, and glu1419, which may be accessed from
the intracellular mouth of the pore. taken together, our
results suggest that verapamil may block closed channels
and open/inactivated channels by binding to distinct sites,
which include tiia as a common determinant in ca2⫹. this
scenario was proposed previously based upon experiments
using a membrane-impermeable, quaternary ammonium derivative of  xxxd888xxx . these experiments suggested that closedchannel block was mediated by a binding site accessible from
the extracellular surface of the channel, whereas frequencydependent block was mediated by a binding site accessible
from the intracellular side of the membrane (berjukov et al.,
1996). in addition, our finding that, with the exception of
phe1117, the molecular determinants for frequency-dependent verapamil block are conserved among voltage-gated
ca2⫹ channels (i.e., thr1116, glu1118, glu1419) may explain the relatively low discrimination of l-type and non-ltype ca2⫹ channels by verapamil (diochot et al., 1995; ishibashi et al., 1995).
conserved residues thr707, thr1116, and thr1417
and  xxxg304xxx  activity in ca2ⴙ. our observation that the
conserved thr residues adjacent to the selectivity filter glutamates contribute to ca2⫹ modulation of verapamil block of
closed channels was unexpected. we had previously shown
that the eiiq, eiiiq, and eivq mutations disrupt ca2⫹dependent inactivation, and eiiiq and eivq increase the
permeability of ca2⫹ relative to ba2⫹ (dilmac et al., 2003).
therefore, we examined these properties of channel activity
in the thr-to-ala mutants. our finding that none of the
thr-to-ala mutations disrupts ca2⫹-dependent inactivation
(fig. 10) is consistent with our observations with the f1117g
mutant, which disrupts ca2⫹ modulation of diltiazem and
verapamil block but does not disrupt ca2⫹-dependent inactivation. our observations with the thr-to-ala mutants also
further highlight the specific role of the selectivity filter glu
residues, among other adjacent residues, in mediating ca2⫹dependent inactivation. however, thr707 and thr1116, as
well as phe1117, apparently play a role in forming the ion
permeation pathway, because mutation of these residues increases the permeability of ca2⫹ relative to ba2⫹ (fig. 11).
in summary, we have shown that ca2⫹ potentiation of
closed-channel block of  xxxg304xxx  by verapamil requires all four
selectivity filter glutamates, whereas amino acid residues
adjacent to the selectivity filter in domain iii contribute to
the high-affinity binding of verapamil to the depolarized
state of the channel. furthermore, because ca2⫹ does not
potentiate frequency-dependent verapamil block, ca2⫹ is not
likely to potentiate binding of verapamil to the depolarized
state of the channel. our results further differentiate the
molecular mechanisms of verapamil and diltiazem block of
 xxxg304xxx , suggest that distinct binding sites may mediate verapamil block of closed and depolarized channels, and sug-

does not affect the shift of channels to the fast-inactivating
state induced by verapamil (fig. 7b). our finding that verapamil accelerates the inactivation of  xxxg304xxx  channels and
increases the fraction of channels inactivating is consistent
with previous studies (johnson et al., 1996; sokolov et al.,
2001). however, our results with eiiiq are in contrast to
observations with mutations in ivs6 which accelerated both
verapamil block and recovery from verapamil block at ⫹10
mv (johnson et al., 1996). the effect of the f1117g mutation
on frequency-dependent verapamil block seems to be ca2⫹dependent, because a fit of the data to a single exponential
function indicates that steady-state block of f1117g in ba2⫹
is not different from that of wt  xxxg304xxx , although the current
remaining at the 20th pulse is clearly different from that of
wt (fig. 8b). we examined the inactivation rate of f1117g
in the presence and absence of 30 ␮m verapamil in ba2⫹ and
did not find any significant difference from wt (n. dilmac
and g. h. hockerman, unpublished data). it is not clear how
the f1117g mutant is specifically slowing development of

ca2ⴙ and frequency modulation of verapamil block of  xxxg304xxx 

gest that common molecular determinants may mediate the
block of non-l-type voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels by verapamil.
