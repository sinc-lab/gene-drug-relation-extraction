to get some insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the sterol branch of the mevalonate pathway, tobacco
(nicotiana tabacum cv bright yellow-2) cell suspensions were treated with squalestatin-1 and  xxxd3314xxx , two specific
inhibitors of squalene synthase (sqs) and  xxxg2197xxx , respectively. these two enzymes catalyze the first two steps
involved in sterol biosynthesis. in highly dividing cells, sqs was actively expressed concomitantly with 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  reductase and both sterol methyltransferases. at nanomolar concentrations, squalestatin was
found to inhibit efficiently sterol biosynthesis as attested by the rapid decrease in sqs activity and [14c]radioactivity from
acetate incorporated into sterols. a parallel dose-dependent accumulation of  xxxd2085xxx , the dephosphorylated form of the sqs
substrate, was observed without affecting  xxxd2086xxx  synthase steady-state mrna levels. treatment of tobacco
cells with  xxxd3314xxx  is also shown to inhibit sterol synthesis. in addition, this inhibitor induced an impressive accumulation
of squalene and a dose-dependent stimulation of the triacylglycerol content and synthesis, suggesting the occurrence of
regulatory relationships between sterol and triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathways. we demonstrate that squalene was stored
in cytosolic lipid particles, but could be redirected toward sterol synthesis if required. inhibition of either sqs or squalene
epoxidase was found to trigger a severalfold increase in enzyme activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx 
reductase, giving first evidence for a positive feedback regulation of this key enzyme in response to a selective depletion of
endogenous sterols. at the same time, no compensatory responses mediated by sqs were observed, in sharp contrast to the
situation in mammalian cells.

in higher plants, two distinct pathways have been
shown to operate concomitantly for synthesizing  xxxd2397xxx , the common precursor for all
isoprenoids. plastid isoprenoids such as carotenoids,
mono- and diterpenes, or the prenyl chains of chlorophylls and plastoquinones are formed from 2-cmethyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate, which itself arises
from the initial condensation of pyruvate with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (for review, see lichtenthaler, 1999; rohmer, 1999). in the cytosol, isoprenoids
are synthesized via the classical acetate/mevalonate
(mva) pathway, in which 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (coa) reductase (hmgr)
plays a key role. this enzyme is encoded by a multigene family (bach et al., 1991; stermer et al., 1994).
in this pathway,  xxxd2086xxx  (fpp) occupies a central position from which specific cis- and
trans-prenyltransferases dispatch isoprene units to
either sterols or non-sterol isoprenoids as represented by sesquiterpenes, ubiquinone, heme a,  xxxd2085xxx , or prenylated proteins (fig. 1). it has been
recently proposed that specific classes of isoprenoids might be produced within distinct metabolic
channels or metabolons, probably involving indi* corresponding author; e-mail ma.hartmann@ibmp-ulp.ustrasbg.fr; fax 33–3–90 –24 –1884.

vidual hmgr isoforms (chappell, 1995; weissenborn et al., 1995). sterols represent the major end
products of this multibranched pathway, but what
controls the whole pathway is still far from being
understood. such a control might either concern
only branch point enzymes or involve coordinated
functioning of distinct metabolic channels, each one
being regulated independently from one another
(chappell, 1995).
the first step committed to the sterol branch of the
isoprenoid pathway is catalyzed by the squalene synthase (sqs), which mediates the reductive head-tohead condensation of two molecules of fpp to form
squalene via presqualene diphosphate (poulter,
1990). this reaction takes place in membranes of
endoplasmic reticulum, as do all subsequent steps
involved in sterol biosynthesis. because of its particular position at the interface between hydrophilic
and hydrophobic intermediates, sqs might constitute a major control point for regulating the sterol
branch in directing fpp molecules into either sterols
or non-sterol isoprenoids in response to changing
cellular requirements. the sequence of reactions
needed to convert squalene into end products is now
well known (benveniste, 1986), and the “state of art”
on relevant enzymes and genes has been just reviewed (bach and benveniste, 1997). in contrast to
animal and fungal cells, higher plants synthesize a
mixture of sterols in which sitosterol, stigmasterol,

and 24-methylcholesterol often predominate. these
compounds play an essential role as membrane components in regulating the fluidity and permeability of
membranes and the activity of membrane-associated
proteins (hartmann, 1998), but some sterols or biosynthetic intermediates might also serve as signal
molecules during plant growth and development
(clouse, 2000). despite the critical importance of sterols, mechanisms responsible for sterol homeostasis
in higher plants are still largely unknown. recent
reports have pointed out that hmgr could regulate
the flux of intermediates toward the sterol branch
(gondet et al., 1994; chappell et al., 1995; schaller et
al., 1995), but whether or not this enzyme is able to
respond to a depletion of sterol end products had not
yet been investigated until now.
to get some insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the sterol biosynthetic pathway,
the present study was focused on the role played by
the plant sqs. early work with plant cell suspension
cultures has already emphasized its involvement in
plant defense reactions. a very fast inhibition of sqs
activity was observed after addition of fungal elicitors. the resulting arrest of sterol biosynthesis has
been interpreted as a means for the cell to either
redirect metabolic intermediates, especially fpp, toward the synthesis of sesquiterpene phytoalexins
(threlfall and whitehead, 1988; vögeli and chappell,
1988; zook and kuc⬘, 1991) or simply to leave
“house-keeping” metabolism pending better conditions (haudenschild and hartmann, 1995). this work
was aimed at probing the effects of a direct inhibition
of sqs in tobacco (nicotiana tabacum cv bright
yellow-2 [ xxxd3421xxx -2]) cell suspension cultures. the recent availability of squalestatins (also called zaragozic acids), which are highly potent and specific
inhibitors of sqs (baxter et al., 1992; bergstrom et al.,
1993), gives the opportunity to investigate whether

or not compensatory responses take place in the case
of a depletion of only squalene-derived products. in
particular, we wanted to check the possibility for
hmgr to be a target for positive feedback regulation
by endogenous sterols. our study also comprises an
investigation of responses of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells to an inhibition of  xxxg2197xxx  (se), the next committed
enzyme to the sterol pathway. this enzyme catalyzes
the stereospecific conversion of squalene to (3s)-2,3oxidosqualene in the presence of molecular oxygen.
it is the first oxygen-requiring step in the sterol biosynthetic pathway and, thus, might constitute a secondary regulatory level. se can be specifically inhibited by compounds belonging to the class of
allylamines (ryder, 1991).
here, we show that both squalestatin-1 (sq) and
 xxxd3314xxx  (tb) are able to inhibit efficiently sterol
biosynthesis in  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells and, thus, to induce a
decrease in the sterol cell content. in the case of tb
treatment, this depletion was accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of squalene and by an increase in the content and the rate of synthesis of
triacylglycerols (tag). squalene was found to accumulate in lipid droplets but could be redirected toward sterol biosynthesis if necessary. our results
demonstrate that inhibition of either sqs or se triggers an increase in hmgr enzyme activity, giving
evidence for a positive feedback regulation of this
key enzyme in response to a selective depletion of
endogenous sterols. surprisingly, we observed no
compensatory responses mediated by sqs, in sharp
contrast to the situation in animal systems.

figure 2 shows a typical growth curve of a  xxxd3421xxx -2
cell culture and the corresponding changes in four
sterol enzyme activities and in free sterol levels. microsomal fractions were prepared from cultures collected on the designated days after subculturing and
used for both enzymatic assays and sterol determinations. we monitored sqs activity and the activities
of hmgr and sterol methyltransferases smt1 and
smt2 throughout the growth cycle. hmgr, an upstream enzyme, is involved in the synthesis of both
sterols and non-sterol isoprenoids. sterol methyltransferases catalyze two distinct steps downstream
of squalene: the s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx -dependent methylation of cycloartenol (smt1) and of 24-methylenelophenol (smt2) to give 24-methylenecycloartanol
and 24-ethylidenelophenol, respectively.
one or 2 d after subculturing, the tobacco cell
culture entered into a rapid growth phase, as attested
by a large increase in fresh cell mass, and reached a
stationary phase after 7 d (fig. 2a). activities of the
four enzymes exhibited very similar changes over the
course of a culture cycle, with a maximum found on

levels over the growth cycle are given. only free
⌬5-sterols, the end products of the pathway, were
quantified (as micrograms per milligram of protein).
as expected, these compounds mainly accumulated
in the stationary phase.
the sterol composition of 3-d-old  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells is given
in table i. stigmasterol, 24-methylcholesterol and sitosterol were by far the predominant sterols. the other
sterols were isofucosterol, 24-methylenecholesterol,
cholesterol, and ⌬7-cholesterol. other compounds
(about 1.2% of total sterols) represented the usual
sterol biosynthetic intermediates: 4␣-methylsterols
(obtusifoliol, cycloeucalenol, 24-methylene-, and 24ethylidenelophenol) and 4,4-dimethylsterols (cycloartenol and 24-methylenecycloartanol). the relative
proportions of the different end products were found
not to change over the growth cycle, with the excep336

three-day-old  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were treated with concentrations of sq ranging from 0 to 0.5 ␮m for 24 h
and incubated with radioactive sodium acetate for

sterols (as the sum of free and esterified forms) were
quantified by gas chromatography (gc) as acetate
derivatives. table ii shows that sq severely impaired
cell growth as attested by a 50% decrease in the cell
mass after a treatment with 0.5 ␮m. a parallel dosedependent decrease in the sterol cell content was
found. the high sensitivity of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells toward the
inhibitor is illustrated by the very fast depletion of
the pool of 4,4-dimethylsterols, the early precursors
of sterols, which was reduced by 88% after a treatment with only 50 nm sq (data not shown). the
efficiency of sq as an inhibitor of the sterol pathway
was confirmed by measurements of radioactivity
from [14c]acetate incorporated into end products.
after addition of 50 nm sq, radioactivity associated
with 4-demethylsterols accounted for only 4% compared with that of sterols from control cells (table ii).
at the same time, a dose-dependent accumulation of
a labeled compound was observed. this compound,
which was recovered in the band corresponding to

originate from hydrolysis of radioactive fpp molecules not used for sterol synthesis.
sqs activity

the target of sq is sqs as illustrated in table ii. a
dose as low as 50 nm sq was shown to be sufficient to
inhibit almost completely sqs activity in microsomal
fractions. such an inhibition was found to take place in
a few hours, with an ic50 value of 5.5 nm, indicating
the very potent inhibitory power of sq. this compound, which partially mimics the structure of fpp
and/or presqualene diphosphate, has been described
as a competitive inhibitor of sqs (bergstrom et al.,
1993).
attempts were made to recover sqs activity in
microsomal membranes from sq-treated cells. however, neither extensive washes of intact cells nor dilution and additional centrifugations of microsomes
were successful, suggesting that sq also acts as a
mechanism-based irreversible inactivator of plant
sqs (lindsey and harwood, 1995).
sqs,  xxxg778xxx  ( xxxg778xxx ), and hmgr expression

to investigate whether sqs transcription could be
affected by the inhibition of sqs activity, total rna
was isolated from  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells treated with different
sq concentrations. a full-length sqs cdna from
nicotiana benthamiana (hanley et al., 1996), which has
98% identity with the corresponding n. tabacum
cdna, was used as a probe. after hybridization with
this probe, transcripts with a size of 1.6 kb could be
detected. as shown in figure 3b, the levels of sqs
transcripts were not found to change significantly,
despite an almost complete inhibition of sqs activity.
a time-course study (from 0 to 48 h) of effects induced by 0.5 ␮m sq also showed no differences between sqs mrna levels from control and treated
cells, whatever the period of time (fig. 4b). because
sqs inhibition possibly induces an increased amount
of fpp molecules in the cytosol, we checked the
effects of sq treatments on the transcription of  xxxg778xxx .
northern-blot experiments were performed with a
partial  xxxg778xxx  cdna from  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells as a probe. the

sqs activity

corresponding mrna levels, with a size of about 1.7
kb, remained constant whatever the dose of sq used,
suggesting that  xxxg778xxx  transcription was neither affected by sqs inhibition, nor by the excess of  xxxd2085xxx 
and fpp.
it is well known that hmgr constitutes the major
limiting-step in cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells (goldstein and brown, 1990). the inhibition
of sqs and the resulting depletion of squalenederived products were shown to induce compensatory responses mediated by hmgr (ness et al., 1994;
lopez et al., 1998). it seemed interesting to us to
investigate whether similar responses could also take
place in  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells. three-day-old  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were
treated for 24 h with sq concentrations varying from
0 to 0.5 ␮m and were used to isolate both total rna
and microsomal fractions, for hmgr activity measurements. as shown in figure 3a, microsomal fractions from sq-treated  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were found to exhibit 2- to 4-fold increased hmgr enzyme activities
compared with control cells. the highest stimulation
rate was observed at 75 nm. such a stimulation of
hmgr activity could be detected as early as 6 h after
sq administration and progressively increased until
24 h (fig. 4a). for northern-blot experiments, we
used as a probe a 1,400-bp fragment corresponding to
the c-terminal part (catalytic site) of a nicotiana sylvestris hmgr cdna (genschik et al., 1992). hmgr
transcripts with a size of about 2.5 kb could be detected. figure 3b shows a dose-dependent increase in
hmgr mrna levels from sq-treated  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells. a
5-fold increase was found in cells treated with 500 nm
sq. at this concentration, the highest level of transcripts was observed 24 h after sq administration
(fig. 4b).
taken together, these results indicate that the inhibition of sqs by sq triggered a stimulation of both
hmgr steady-state mrna and enzyme activity,
suggesting that the arrest of sterol biosynthesis and
the resulting depletion of squalene-derived products
exerted a positive feedback regulatory effect on the
transcription of hmgr. surprisingly, this inhibition
did not activate sqs transcription.

ment with 30 ␮m tb, the squalene content amounted
to 5 mg g⫺1 dry weight, whereas it was barely detectable in control cells (about 20 ␮g g⫺1 dry weight).
at the same time, the remaining ⌬5-sterols accounted
for only 0.85 mg g⫺1 dry weight compared with 1.8
mg g⫺1 for control cells, corresponding approximately to a 50% decrease in the usual free sterol
content. such an accumulation of squalene clearly
indicates an inhibition of se by tb, leading to an
arrest of end product biosynthesis. no change in
relative proportions of ⌬5-sterols was found (data not
shown). it is remarkable to see that  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells can
accommodate such high squalene intracellular concentrations because no inhibition of cell growth or
cell death was observed (data not shown).

inhibition of early steps in the sterol pathway

figure 5. effects of tb on sterol composition (a) and biosynthesis (b).
three-day-old  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were treated with concentrations of tb
ranging from 0 to 30 ␮m for 24 h and incubated with sodium
[1-14c]acetate for 2 h before cell harvesting. sterols were extracted as
indicated in “materials and methods.” a, squalene and free sterols
(acetate derivatives) were quantified by gc. sterols amounts are
expressed in milligrams per gram dry weight. b, radioactivities
incorporated into sterols and precursors are expressed as 105 cpm
g⫺1 dry weight (dwt).

icant increase in the squalene content occurred as
soon as 6 h after administration of the inhibitor and
continued up to 48 h. after 96 h, no additional accumulation of squalene was observed (data not shown).
further evidence for the se inhibition was obtained
by feeding control and tb-treated  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells with
[14c]acetate for 2 h before cell harvesting. in control
cells, most of the acetate radioactivity was incorporated into free sterols, whereas in tb-treated cells,
squalene was by far the most labeled compound (fig.
5b). after treatment with 3 ␮m tb, about 71% of the
radioactivity recovered in the sterol branch was already associated with squalene. at this concentration, a time-course study of squalene biosynthesis
demonstrated that the highest rate of synthesis was
obtained after 24 h of treatment (data not shown).
after treatment with 30 ␮m, 97% of the radioactivity
was present in squalene and only 2% in the end
products.
cycloartenol accumulation at low tb concentration

as shown in figure 5, treatment of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells with
3 ␮m tb was found to induce a significant accumu-

lation of 4,4-dimethylsterols. these compounds were
mainly represented by cycloartenol and 24-methylenecycloartanol (table i). gc analysis of the corresponding acetate derivatives indicated a specific increase in the cycloartenol content (data not shown),
suggesting that smt1 involved in the methylation of
cycloartenol to give 24-methylenecycloartanol might
be down-regulated. to get more insight into this
process,  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were treated with 3 ␮m tb for
periods of time from 0 to 48 h. a 2-h pulse of radioactive acetate was given just before cell harvesting.
after lipid extraction, the fraction of 4,4-dimethylsterols
was analyzed in more detail. the acetate derivatives
were separated on agno3-impregnated thin-layer
chromatography (tlc) plates. cycloartenol and 24methylenecycloartanol were eluted and quantified by
gc, and their radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. as shown in figure 7a, the cycloartenol content of treated cells was found to increase
progressively in function of the duration of contact
with the inhibitor. in contrast, cycloartenol did not
accumulate in control cells (fig. 7a). as a consequence, the radioactivity associated with cycloartenol declined rapidly in control cells, whereas in
treated cells, cycloartenol continued to be actively
synthesized for as long as 24 h (fig. 7b). whatever
the period of time, only low amounts of radioactivity
were detected in 24-methylenecycloartanol.
to investigate whether the methylation of cycloartenol by the smt1 could be inhibited in  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells
treated by low tb concentrations, microsomal fractions were isolated from control and tb-treated cells
and tested for their smt1 enzyme activities. similar
enzyme activities were found (data not shown), indicating that the smt1 protein remained active despite the tb treatment of tobacco cells. we also
checked that 30 ␮m tb had no direct inhibitory effect

are expressed in milligrams per gram dry weight (dwt).

on smt1 activity. thus, these data indicate that the
inhibition of the methylation reaction occurs only in
intact treated cells and could result from a secondary
regulatory effect.
sqs and hmgr expression

as stated above, treatment of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells with tb
triggered the accumulation of impressive amounts of
squalene, the product of the reaction catalyzed by
sqs. in control cells, endogenous squalene was
barely detectable. despite such large increases of

tag synthesis

besides the accumulation of squalene, tb treatment
of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells also triggered a significant dosedependent increase in the tag content, with an
8-fold enhancement of the mean value measured for
control cells after administration of 30 ␮m (table iii).
this increase directly resulted from a stimulation of
their de novo biosynthetic rate, as indicated by the
parallel increase in their [14c]radioactivity (table iii).
a concomitant accumulation of lipid droplets in the
cytosol of treated cells was found to take place. light
microscopy observations showed the presence of
many orange spheres after staining of cells with sudan iv, a lipid-specific dye (fig. 9). very few or none
of these lipid droplets were seen in control cells.
these results suggest that relationships between ste-

rol and tag biosynthetic pathways might occur in
vivo.

squalene intracellular localization

to address the question of the intracellular localization of the overproduced squalene,  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells
were treated with 30 ␮m tb for 24 h before being
used for isolation of a microsomal fraction. after
sedimentation at 100,000g, lipid particles appeared as
a fluffy lipid layer at the surface of the corresponding
supernatant. both fractions were then analyzed for
their squalene content. in control cells, squalene
could be not detected in the supernatant. in contrast,
most (i.e. higher than 90%) of the squalene from
treated cells was recovered in the lipid droplets. the
remaining 10% were associated with the microsomal
fraction.
it seemed to us interesting to investigate whether
or not the squalene stored in these lipid particles
could be reused as a precursor for sterol biosynthesis.
 xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were first treated with 30 ␮m tb for 24 h
and fed with radioactive acetate for 2 h just before
cell harvesting. they were then extensively washed
and resuspended in a murashige and skoog medium
containing 0.5 ␮m sq to block the synthesis of endogenous squalene. these cells were allowed to grow for
12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, collected by filtration,
and analyzed for their content in squalene and in free

sterols and their precursors (4,4-dimethyl- and 4␣methylsterols). radioactivity associated with each
class of compounds was also measured. a sample of
 xxxd3421xxx -2 cells treated with tb for 24 h was taken as a
control (t0h). as shown in table iv,  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells collected after 12 and 24 h exhibited dramatic decreases
in both the content and radioactivity of squalene,
whereas concomitant and similar increases were
found for the sterol end products. a 2-fold increase
in the level of 4-demethylsterols occurred after 24 h,
despite the inhibition of sqs by sq, and these compounds contained the most radioactivity initially associated with squalene. in the further 24 h (t48h), their
amount was reduced by 50% because no more
squalene was available. the data from table iv also
indicate a transient increase in both the contents and
radioactivities of the sterol biosynthetic precursors,
giving evidence for a restart of an active sterol biosynthesis from the pool of radioactive squalene, triggered by the tb removal. finally, it should be emphasized that such a restoration of the sterol
biosynthesis was accompanied by a parallel decrease
in the content and radioactivity of tag, indicating
once more likely relationships between both pathways. taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that squalene, which was previously stored in
cytoplasmic lipid particles, could be remobilized for
an active sterol biosynthesis. even if the fate of tag
molecules remains to be investigated, it appears that
these lipid particles actually do constitute a pool of
available metabolic intermediates.
discussion

in contrast to the situation in animal cells, much
less is known regarding regulation of the sterol pathway in plants. in that context, we planned to investigate the potential regulatory role played by the
plant sqs for the following reasons: (a) sqs is
the first committed enzyme to the sterol branch of the
isoprenoid pathway and as such, may play a critical
role in directing fpp molecules in either sterol or
non-sterol isoprenoids in response to changing cellular requirements (fig. 1); (b) because sterols are major
isoprenoid end products, most part of precursors

goes through sqs; (c) sqs has been known to participate in plant defense reactions against pathogens
(threlfall and whitehead, 1988; vögeli and chappell,
1988; zook and kuć, 1991; haudenschild and hartmann, 1995); and (d) in mammalian cells, sqs is
coordinately regulated with hmgr by a sterol feedback mechanism (sakakura et al., 2001). moreover,
inhibition of sqs would not deprive the cell of important non-sterol compounds such as isoprenylated
proteins, dolichol, heme a, or ubiquinone. as a plant
material, we used tobacco by-2 cell suspension cultures. this cell line was originally selected for its very
short cell cycle (about 15 h; nagata et al., 1992). such
a suspension was, therefore, particularly suitable for
metabolic studies and labeling experiments.  xxxd3421xxx -2
cells were first checked for their ability for sterol
synthesis. as shown in figure 2, sqs and smt1 and
smt2 enzyme activities were expressed during the
entire cell growth, with a maximum at 5 d after
subculturing. hmgr, which is involved in the synthesis of both sterols and non-sterol isoprenoids, exhibited a very similar expression profile, suggesting
that all the enzymes of the sterol pathway were coordinately regulated, to sustain an active synthesis of
membranes in rapidly dividing cells.
to investigate the regulatory response of sqs to
depletion of sterols,  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were treated with sq.
this inhibitor belongs to the class of sqs, a family of
fungal metabolites recently discovered. these compounds, which are analogs of fpp and presqualene
diphosphate, are potent competitive inhibitors of
mammalian sqs (baxter et al., 1992; bergstrom et al.,
1993). we show here that sq is also a strong inhibitor
of the tobacco sqs. the high efficiency of sq as an
inhibitor of sterol synthesis was revealed by the rapid
and dramatic decrease in the radioactivity from
[14c]acetate incorporated into sterols after treatment
with nanomolar concentrations of sq, resulting in a
decrease in the sterol cell content (table ii). at the
same time, sqs activity rapidly became barely detectable. sq was found to inhibit tobacco sqs with an
ic50 of 5.5 nm (data not shown), a value similar to
that obtained for mammalian sqs (lindsey and harwood, 1995). sq was also found to rapidly impair cell
growth of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells (table ii). such an effect on cell

 xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were first treated with 30 ␮m tb for 24 h and then incubated with sodium [1-14c]acetate for 2 h. cells were extensively washed
to remove the inhibitor and non-incorporated radioactivity. cells were resuspended in murashige and skoog medium (t0h) and allowed to grow
with 0.5 ␮m sq. aliquots of cells were taken after 0 (t0h), 12 (t12h), 24 (t24h), and 48 h (t48h). all samples were analyzed for their squalene, sterol,
and tag contents and radioactivities. dwt, dry weight; nd, not determined.

inhibition of early steps in the sterol pathway

growth probably resulted from an inhibition of cell
division. when given to synchronized  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells,
this inhibitor triggers an arrest of the cell cycle specifically in the g1/g0 phase, but without inducing
cytotoxicity or cell death (hemmerlin et al., 2000).
an intriguing question is related to the fate of fpp
molecules, which do not contribute to the build-up of
sterols. first, the increase in cytosolic fpp resulting
from sq treatments does not appear to regulate negatively  xxxg778xxx  expression because no changes in corresponding steady-state mrna levels occurred,
whatever the sq concentration (fig. 3). however, fpp
might have an effect on mva kinase, an enzyme
upstream in the pathway because it has been shown
to be a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme with
respect to atp (schulte et al., 2000). as already stated
(fig. 1), fpp serves as a substrate for a variety of
non-sterol isoprenoids. as a consequence, a redirection of fpp toward such pathways could appear to be
likely. we have previously shown that exogenous
 xxxd2085xxx  could be incorporated into sterols but also
into the prenyl side chain of ubiquinone q10 and
proteins from  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells (hartmann and bach,
2001). when radioactive  xxxd2085xxx  was given to tobacco cells in the presence of 0.5 ␮m sq, no increase
in the label of ubiquinone and proteins occurred,
indicating that no additional fpp molecules were
redirected toward these compounds (m.-a. hartmann, unpublished data). these results are similar to
those from crick et al. (1995) obtained with brain
cells. under the same conditions, these authors also
demonstrated that sq had no effect on the synthesis
of dolichol-phosphate.
our labeling experiments showed that a significant
part of fpp molecules were hydrolyzed in response
to sq treatment, as attested by the dose-dependent
accumulation of radioactive  xxxd2085xxx  (data not presented). similar observations were made in the case
of sq-treated mammalian cells (bergstrom et al., 1993;
lopez et al., 1998). such a hydrolysis might be catalyzed by a fpp diphosphatase, which could be induced by the stress caused by the sq treatment (nah
et al., 2001). however, it should be pointed out that
 xxxd2085xxx  is also known to have deleterious effects. in
particular, when added to  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells at a concentration higher than 20 ␮m,  xxxd2085xxx  induces cell death
(hemmerlin and bach, 2000). as a consequence, its
level in the cytosol has to be closely controlled. however, the possibility of a conversion of fpp or  xxxd2085xxx  into other metabolites should not be excluded.
in sharp contrast to sqs inhibition by sq, treatment
of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells by tb, an inhibitor of se, did not affect
cell growth. tb belongs to the class of compounds
termed allylamines, which have significant impact as
antifungal drugs (ryder, 1991). tb is a reversible,
noncompetitive inhibitor of se (ryder, 1991). we
show here that tb is also active in plant systems, as
attested by a dose-dependent decrease in the free
sterol content and by a concomitant accumulation of

squalene. these data are in agreement with previous
results obtained with celery (apium graveolens) cell
suspension cultures (yates et al., 1991) or wheat
(triticum aestivum) seedlings (simmen and gisi,
1995). however, under our conditions, no accumulation of ⌬5,7-sterols could be observed, and the absence of unusual intermediates like ⌬8- or ⌬8,14sterols suggests that tb had no secondary target in
 xxxd3421xxx -2 cells (yates et al., 1992). such high amounts of
squalene seemed not to be toxic for the cell. we
observed that inhibition of se by tb in  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells
was accompanied by a proliferation of cytosolic lipid
droplets (fig. 9), in which squalene accumulated.
our results provide evidence that squalene could be
remobilized for an active sterol biosynthesis in response to a depletion of end products (table iv).
therefore, lipid particles actually do constitute a pool
of available biosynthetic intermediates and not only a
metabolically inactive storage compartment, in
agreement with recent data in yeast (saccharomyces
cerevisiae) from milla et al. (2002). concomitant to the
squalene accumulation, a dose-dependent increase in
the tag content and rate of synthesis was observed
(table iii). these tag probably also accumulated in
lipid droplets because they could not be detected in
microsomes. the mechanisms whereby the inhibition
of se induces the tag synthesis still remain to be
elucidated. however, it should be emphasized that a
stimulation of tag synthesis was also observed in
leek (allium porrum) seedlings treated with fenpropimorph, another inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis (m.-a.
hartmann, a.-m. perret, j.-p. carde, c. cassagne, and
p. moreau, unpublished data), suggesting that some
regulatory relationships between sterol and tag biosynthetic pathways might occur in plants.
because sq and tb treatments of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were
found to induce significant decreases in the sterol cell
content, it was interesting to investigate whether
compensatory responses could be mediated by
hmgr. in mammals, hmgr is the major ratelimiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. this enzyme is encoded by a single gene. it is
well established that reductase activity is controlled
through multivalent feedback regulation, involving
both sterols and non-sterol compounds derived from
mva (goldstein and brown, 1990). in sharp contrast
to animal systems, the occurrence of multiple genes
encoding hmgr is a general feature of higher plants.
individual genes have been shown to exhibit different expression patterns in response to physiological
and environmental stimuli such as light, plant
growth regulators, wounding, or pathogen attack
(bach et al., 1991; stermer et al., 1994). it has been
proposed that the different hmgr isoforms might
play distinct roles associated with the production of
specific isoprenoid compounds (chappell, 1995;
weissenborn et al., 1995).
previous work had given evidence for an involvement of plant hmgr in controlling the flux of inter-

mediates toward sterol biosynthesis (gondet et al.,
1994; chappell et al., 1995; schaller et al., 1995). tobacco plants overexpressing either the hmgr1 gene
from hevea brasiliensis (schaller et al., 1995) or a truncated hmgr gene from guinea pig (chappell et al.,
1995) synthesize higher amounts of sterols and sterol
precursors, which accumulate as steryl esters in cytosolic lipid bodies (gondet et al., 1994). however, no
change in the free sterol content was observed. thus,
sterol acylation appears as a means for the cell to
maintain sterol homeostasis. we show here for the
first time, to our knowledge, that tobacco hmgr is
able to respond to a selective depletion of endogenous sterols. decreases in squalene and squalenederived compounds resulting from treatments of
 xxxd3421xxx -2 cells with sq or tb triggered 2- to 4-fold increases in hmgr enzyme activity (figs. 3a, 4a, and
8a). in the case of sqs inhibition by sq, an enhancement of corresponding mrna levels was observed,
giving evidence for an activation of hmgr gene
transcription. in rat liver, a similar stimulation of
hmgr transcription was previously reported in response to sq (ness et al., 1994; lopez et al., 1998). on
the other hand, se inhibition by tb was not accompanied by changes in the hmgr transcripts, suggesting that the regulatory response mediated by hmgr
could be exerted at a translational or posttranslational (i.e. catalytic efficiency or protein degradation)
level. to our knowledge, whereas plant hmgr appears to be mainly transcriptionally controlled (weissenborn et al., 1995), such a feedback regulatory effect occurring at the hmgr protein level in response
to a depletion of end products has not yet been
reported in plants. thus, our results show differential
regulatory responses induced by both inhibitors.
jiang et al. (1993) and keller et al. (1993) have
presented convincing evidence that the mammalian
sqs genes are regulated by their transcription rate in
response to exogenous sterols and inhibitors of sterol
synthesis. surprisingly, our results indicate that tobacco sqs exhibits a different behavior. we show
that sqs mrna levels were not altered after treatment of  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells with either sq or tb. thus, the
expression pattern of sqs appears to be insensitive to
both the inhibition of sqs activity and the accumulation of squalene, the product of the reaction. such
an impressive accumulation of squalene, which was
induced by the inhibition of se by tb, can likely be
attributed to the enhancement of hmgr expression,
leading to a greater amount of enzyme protein and,
thus, to a higher synthesis of early intermediates. at
the same time, no change in the sqs enzyme activity
occurred, indicating that sqs would not be a limiting
step for sterol synthesis in tobacco cells. however, as
described above, squalene did not accumulate in endoplasmic reticulum membranes but in lipid droplets. thus, sqs could not “sense” the excess of
squalene. in the same context, no changes in sqs
activity were observed when  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were treated
344

with lab 170250f, an inhibitor of obtusifoliol 14demethylase (taton et al., 1988), an enzyme downstream of squalene, or with  xxxd2510xxx , an inhibitor of
hmgr (l. wentzinger and m.-a. hartmann, unpublished data). taken together, these data indicate that
sqs is regulated differently in  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells and in
mammalian cells (tansey and shechter, 2000). the
next step will be to check whether similar regulatory
mechanisms for sqs also take place in intact plants.
genes encoding enzymes making up a specific
metabolon must have similar transcriptional networks to coordinate expression of the metabolic unit.
in mammals, the cholesterol feedback system is mediated by a family of membrane-bound transcription
factors known as sterol regulatory element (sre)binding proteins, which recognize a 10-bp sequence
(sre) within the target genes (brown and goldstein,
1997). it has been just reported that such a srebinding protein activation mechanism concerns every step of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway
(sakakura et al., 2001). in the promoters of plant
hmgr genes, no consensus sequences similar to
these sre or other cis regulatory elements from animal sterol-regulated genes have been found so far
(enjuto et al., 1995). moreover, many enzymes involved in plant sterol biosynthesis are encoded by
multiple genes (bach and benveniste, 1997). for instance, this is the case for sqs (kribii et al., 1997;
devarenne et al., 1998) and se (schäfer et al., 1999).
the biological significance of such a plethora of
genes remains to be elucidated. higher plants have
probably evolved specific mechanisms for regulating
their complex isoprenoid pathway, mechanisms that
remain to be discovered. in this challenging context,
we are currently investigating in more detail sterol
homeostasis in plant cells.
materials and methods
chemicals
all chemicals were purchased from sigma (st louis). sodium
[1-14c]acetate (54 ci mol⫺1), [3-14c]hmg-coa and s-adenosyl l-[methyl3
h]met were from amersham (buckinghamshire, uk). [1-3h]fpp was from
isotopchim (ganagobie-peyruis, france). sq was obtained from glaxo
(greenford, middelsex, uk) and dissolved in 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 7.4) to give
a 0.1 mm. stock solution. tb was kindly supplied by dr. n.s. ryder (vienna)
and dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  at a concentration of 50 mm. final
 xxxd1896xxx  concentrations did not exceed 0.05% (v/v).

plant material
cell suspension cultures of tobacco (nicotiana tabacum cv bright yellow-2
[ xxxd3421xxx -2]) were usually grown in 250-ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 80 ml
of modified murashige and skoog medium at 26°c in the dark and subcultured weekly as reported (nagata et al., 1992). cells were harvested by
filtration. in all cases, sterol inhibitors were added to 3-d-old cell cultures.

in vivo labeling experiments
cells were usually incubated with sodium [1-14c]acetate (5 ␮ci, 0.2 mm)
for 2 h just before cell harvesting. unincorporated radioactivity was removed by washing cells on the filter.

isolation of microsomes
frozen cells were ground in a mortar in the presence of liquid n2. the
powder was resuspended in a medium consisting of 0.25 m suc, 4 mm
edta, 100 mm potassium fluoride, 40 mm sodium ascorbate, and 0.2%
(w/v) bovine  xxxg124xxx  in 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8.0; 10 ml g⫺1 fresh wt).
after filtration through a nylon blutex, the homogenate was centrifuged at
10,000g for 25 min. the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000g
for 60 min. the microsomal pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph
7.5) containing 1.5 mm dithioerythritol and 20% (w/v) glycerol and stored
at ⫺80°c until use. protein concentrations were determined according to
bradford (1976) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.

isolation of lipid particles
frozen cells were ground in a mortar in the presence of liquid n2. the
powder was homogenized in 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8.0) containing 1 mm
edta. after filtration through a nylon blutex, the homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 25 min. the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at
100,000g for 60 min. the white fat pad at the top of the tube was collected
and lyophilized for lipid analyses. the microsomal fraction was resuspended in 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8.0) and 1 mm edta, and centrifuged at
100,000g for 60 min. the microsomal pellet was freeze-dried before lipid
analysis.

lipid analyses
freeze-dried material was ground and extracted by refluxing twice with
dichloromethane:methanol (2:1, v/v) for 2 h. extracts were combined, dried
under reduced pressure, and thoroughly washed at room temperature with
hexane to recover squalene, free sterols, and tag.
sterols were isolated and quantified as previously reported (hartmann
and benveniste, 1987). after recovering from total lipids with hexane, sterols
were loaded on tlc plates, which were developed in dichloromethane (two
runs). purified sterols were then eluted and acetylated before being analyzed by gc on a glass capillary column (30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d., coated
with db-1). the temperature program used includes a fast rise from 60°c to
230°c (30°c min⫺1), then a slow rise from 230°c to 280°c (2°c min⫺1). a
cholesterol standard was added to the samples before analysis. sterols were
identified by gc-mass spectroscopy (rahier and benveniste, 1989).
squalene and steryl esters were separated by tlc with cyclohexane:toluene
(95:5, v/v) as the solvent. squalene (rf 0.5) was eluted and quantified by
gc. the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometer.
tag were quantified using the colorimetric assay from sigma (kit 336-10).

assays for enzyme activities
hmgr and sqs activities were measured according to bach et al. (1986)
and haudenschild and hartmann (1995), respectively. smt activities were
measured in the presence of 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 7.5) containing 100 ␮m
[3h-methyl]ado-met (1 ␮ci), 0.1% (w/v) tween 80, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 50 to 100 ␮g of microsomal membranes, and 100 ␮m cycloartenol
(smt1) or 50 ␮m 24-methylenelophenol (smt2), in a total volume of 100 ␮l.
incubations were carried out at 30°c for 1 h and stopped by adding 12%
(w/v) koh in ethanol. the neutral lipids were extracted with hexane and
loaded on tlc plates. the bands of 4,4-dimethyl sterols (smt1) or 4␣methylsterols (smt2) were scrapped off the plate and their radioactivities
were measured by liquid scintillation counting.

northern blots
total rna was isolated from  xxxd3421xxx -2 cells using the guanidine
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (chomczynski and sacchi, 1987). it
was analyzed (30 ␮g) by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and
blotted onto hybond-n membranes (amersham). radiolabeled cdna
probes were prepared by a random priming method (sambrook et al., 1989).
the nylon membranes were hybridized overnight with a 32p-labeled probe
(106 cpm ml⫺1) in a solution containing 5⫻ denhardt solution, 6⫻ ssc,
0.5% (w/v) sds, and 5 mg ml⫺1 denatured salmon sperm dna, under low
stringency conditions (55°c). membranes were washed twice with 2⫻ ssc
and 0.1% (w/v) sds at room temperature, twice with 0.2⫻ ssc and 0.1%
(w/v) sds at 45°c for 30 min. transcript levels were quantified from the
blots using a phosphorimager (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca), after

an overnight exposure. the membranes were boiled for 3 min in 0.1% (w/v)
sds to remove the bound probe and to reuse them for other hybridizations.
data were normalized for ef1-␣ mrna content and corrected for background. the probes, which were used, are the following: (a) hmgr, a 1.4-kb
fragment corresponding to the catalytic part of a nicotiana sylvestris hmgr
cdna (genschik et al., 1992); (b) sqs, a 1.1-kb xhoi/spei fragment of a
nicotiana benthamiana sqs cdna (hanley et al., 1996); (c) ef1-␣, a 1.7-kb full
length of an arabidopsis ef1-␣ cdna; and (d)  xxxg778xxx , a 390-bp cdna
fragment obtained by pcr amplification of a  xxxd3421xxx -2 cdna library with
degenerate oligonucleotides: b1 [5⬘-(t/c) tt(t/c)(t/c) tigtii(c/t)
iga(t/c) ga(t/c) atiaattga] and e1 [5⬘-ta(a/g) tc(a/g) tc(t/c)
tgiat(t/c) ga(a/g) aa] as described by attucci et al. (1995).

optical observations
 xxxd3421xxx -2 cells were stained with sudan iv (70% [v/v] ethanol). lipid
droplets appear as orange spherical granules on light microscopy.
