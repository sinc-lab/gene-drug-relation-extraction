abstract— xxxd2710xxx , the amide analog of 2-amino-3-benzoylbenzeneacetic acid
(amfenac), was examined in preclinical models for its potential utility as a topical
ocular anti-inflammatory agent. diclofenac was selected as the reference compound.
in contrast to diclofenac (ic50 c 0.12 mm),  xxxd2710xxx  exhibited only weak cox-1
inhibitory activity (ic50 c 64.3 mm). however, amfenac was a potent inhibitor of
both cox-1 (ic50 c 0.25 mm) and cox-2 activity (ic50 c 0.15 mm). ex vivo, a
single topical ocular dose of  xxxd2710xxx  (0.1%) inhibited prostaglandin synthesis in the
iris/ ciliary body (85–95%) and the retina/ choroid (55%). these levels of inhibition
were sustained for 6 h in the iris/ ciliary body and 4 h in the retina/ choroid. diclofenac
(0.1%) suppressed iris/ ciliary body prostaglandin synthesis (100%) for only 20
min, with 75% recovery observed within 6 h following topical dosing. diclofenac’s
inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the retina/ choroid was minimal.  xxxd2710xxx ’s
inhibitory efficacy and longer duration of action was confirmed in a trauma-induced
rabbit model of acute ocular inflammation monitoring protein or pge2 accumulation
in aqueous humor. results warrant further assessment of  xxxd2710xxx ’s topical ocular
efficacy in the treatment of postoperative ocular pain, inflammation, and posterior
segment edema.

introduction
amfenac (2-amino-3-benzoylbenzeneacetic acid) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound with an arylacetic acid structure which exhibits potent
antipyretic and analgesic properties (1). the anti-inflammatory and analgesic
properties of this molecule are mediated through inhibition of cyclooxygenase
(prostaglandin h synthase) activity (2, 3). the potent analgesic properties estab357

lished in preclinical models have been confirmed in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial evaluating amfenac’s efficacy in suppressing post-surgical pain
following extraction of impacted molar teeth (4). amfenac sodium has been
approved in japan and is marketed as fenazox for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis and for pain and/ or inflammation after surgery (5). a series of structural
analogues of amfenac have been prepared to enhance the compound’s therapeutic
index (3). in these studies it was noted that the amide analog of 2-amino-3-benzoylbenzeneacetic acid serves as a prodrug exhibiting potent anti-inflammatory
activity but greatly reduced intestinal toxicity.
despite a plethora of prostaglandin synthase inhibitors available for systemic use, there is a continued need for topical ocular prostaglandin h synthase
inhibitors that are comfortable and efficacious in suppressing postoperative pain,
inflammation and development of cystoid macular edema (6).
 xxxd2710xxx  (figure 1) is a potent, systemic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory prodrug (3). in the present report we examine  xxxd2710xxx  for its a)
intrinsic prostaglandin h synthase inhibitory activity, b) ex vivo inhibition
of prostaglandin synthesis in ocular tissue, and c) anti-inflammatory activity in a trauma (paracentesis)-induced model of acute ocular inflammation in
the nza rabbit following a single topical ocular dose. these studies were
designed to explore the compound’s potential as a topical ocular anti-inflammatory agent. the results are contrasted to those obtained with diclofenac, marketed as voltaren for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and
suppression of ocular pain following photorefractive keratotomy.

materials and methods
animals. new zealand albino rabbits (2–2.5 kg) were obtained from myrtle’s rabbitry,
thompson station, tennessee. all aspects of handling, housing and experimentation conformed with
the arvo resolution for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.
materials.  xxxd2710xxx  was synthesized by the medicinal chemistry unit, alcon laboratories,
inc. (fort worth, texas). diclofenac sodium was purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,

anti-inflammatory efficacy of  xxxd2710xxx  in acute ocular inflammation

359

missouri). for topical ocular administration, the compounds were prepared in an ophthalmic vehicle containing 0.5% hydroxypropyl  xxxd2609xxx . alternatively, a commercial preparation of
diclofenac 0.1% (voltaren ophthalmic, cibavision ophthalmics, atlanta, georgia) was employed,
as indicated in the results section. alcaine ophthalmic solution (0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride)
is also a product of alcon labs. all concentrations are expressed on a weight/ volume basis.
other reagents were obtained as follows: eicosatetraenoic (arachidonic) acid, nucheck prep
(elysian, minnesota); [1-14 c]-eicosatetraenoic acid (53 mci/ mmol) and pge2 [125 i]-ria kits, both
from nen (boston, massachusetts); ns-398 and pgh synthase-2 (cox-2) from sheep placenta
(6500 units/ mg), both from cayman chemical company (ann arbor, maine). all other chemicals
were products from either sigma chemical company (st. louis, missouri) or j. t. baker (phillipsburg, new jersey). solvents used for tissue extraction and hplc analysis were either of hplc
grade or the highest purity available (em science, gibbstown, new jersey). coomassie protein
assay reagent was obtained from pierce chemical (rockford, illinois). budget solve (liquid scintillant) was a product of rpi (mount prospect, illinois).
pgh synthase activity in vitro. inhibition of pgh synthase activity from sheep vesicular
glands (cox-1) was assayed polarographically (7) with a ysi model 53 oxygen monitor as previously described (8). briefly, 10 ml of solubilized microsomal preparation (20 mg/ ml) was added
to the ysi incubation chamber containing 3.0 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 0.5 mm
phenol, and 0.5 mm hematin. aliquots (≤50 ml) of carrier or test compound dissolved in dmso
(carrier) were added to the chamber which was pre-equilibrated to 308 c. the mixture was stirred
for two minutes before the reaction was initiated by addition of 30 ml of ammonium  xxxd208xxx 
(10 mm).
pgh synthase activity from sheep placenta (cox-2) was assayed exactly as described above
with the exception that the amount of enzyme added to the reaction chamber was reduced to 20 mg
protein.
pg synthesis of tissue homogenates of the iris/ ciliary body and the retina/ choroid. pg
synthesis was evaluated in homogenates of iris/ ciliary body and retina/ choroid at various times ranging from 5 min through 8 h after bilateral administration of a topical ocular dose (50 ml) of either test
drug or vehicle. iris/ ciliary body tissue or retina/ choroid tissue was placed in a polypropylene tube
containing 0.5 ml of ice-cold, 50 mm phosphate/ 0.5 mm phenol buffer (ph 7.4) and homogenized
with a brinkman homogenizer. the homogenate preparation, incubation and extraction procedures
were performed as previously detailed (9).
to monitor eicosanoid formation by radio-hplc, homogenates were incubated for 10 min
at 378 c with 10 mm of [1-14 c]-labeled  xxxd208xxx  (10 mci/ mmol). the extraction procedure
employed yielded an overall isotope recovery of 78.9 ± 5.9% (mean ± sd) when [1-14 c]- xxxd208xxx  was used as substrate. pge2 was quantified in organic extracts by hplc as described
by powell (10). alternatively, synthesis of pge2 was assessed by [125 i]-labeled ria following a
10 min incubation of tissue homogenates of the iris/ ciliary body and retina/ choroid with unlabeled
 xxxd208xxx  (10 mm). the incubation conditions and method of extraction of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolites were identical to those described above for the radiometric/ hplc assay procedure.
protein concentration of tissue homogenates was assayed according to the colorimetric method
described by bradford (11).
trauma-induced breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier. the effect of prophylactic topical
ocular administration of a single dose of either  xxxd2710xxx , diclofenac or vehicle on paracentesisinduced breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was assessed in the nza rabbit. the procedure
has been previously described in detail (9). briefly, animals received a single topical ocular dose
of test compound or vehicle (50 ml), administered bilaterally. forty-five min after dosing, 1 drop
(5 ml) of 0.5% proparacaine was instilled in each eye, and trauma was elicited by paracentesis within
5 min. (all modifications of the pretreatment interval are noted in the results section.) removal of
aqueous humor (≈150 ml per eye) was accomplished by puncture of the cornea with a 27 g needle. of

this volume, 100 ml was diluted with an equal volume of a 2% solution of edta in saline (ph 7.4),
frozen on dry ice and stored at − 708 c for later analysis of protein and pge2 content. protein and
pge2 levels in the aqueous humor samples obtained before and after paracentesis were determined
as noted above.
thirty min following the initial paracentesis, animals were euthanized with an overdose of
sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/ kg) via the marginal ear vein. post-trauma aqueous humor samples
were obtained immediately, and were stored and analyzed as described above.

results
inhibition of pgh synthase. in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the
inhibitory potency of  xxxd2710xxx  in suppressing the activity of a partially purified
preparation of pgh synthase-1 from sheep vesicular glands. the free acid analog
amfenac and diclofenac served as reference compounds.  xxxd2710xxx , amfenac and
diclofenac each caused a concentration dependent inhibition of pgh synthase
activity as measured polarographically by decreased rates in oxygen consumption. all compounds produced comparable maximal inhibition (83%–88%) at
their highest test concentrations (table 1).  xxxd2710xxx  clearly exhibited the lowest pgh synthase-1 inhibitory potency, with an ic50 of 64.3 mm. diclofenac
and the free carboxylic acid analog, amfenac, were about 500- and 250-fold
more potent than  xxxd2710xxx , with ic50 values of 0.12 mm and 0.25 mm, respectively. as an inhibitor of pgh synthase-2 activity, amfenac produced half-maximal inhibition at a concentration of 0.15 mm. the reference compound ns-398
was a less potent inhibitor of this enzyme activity than amfenac, with an ic50
value of 0.26 mm.

ex vivo pg synthesis. to obtain direct evidence of suppression of pgh
synthase activity in ocular tissue, ex vivo studies were conducted monitoring
pg formation in the iris/ ciliary body following a single topical ocular administration of  xxxd2710xxx  (0.1%). parallel studies employed the reference compound
diclofenac (0.1%).
a single topical ocular administration of diclofenac (50 ml, 0.1%) significantly inhibited all prostanoid production by the iris/ ciliary body excised 60
minutes following dosing (table 2). inhibition ranged from 42% to 65%, with
pge2 /  xxxg1073xxx  synthesis being most suppressed. notably,  xxxd2710xxx  (50 ml, 0.1%)
promoted significantly greater inhibition. pge2 ,  xxxd1902xxx  , and  xxxg1073xxx  synthesis was
nearly abolished, while pgi2 (measured as 6-keto-pgf1a ), and txb2 / hht production was reduced by 2/ 3 compared to that produced by tissue from naive
animals.
the greater suppression (≥95%) of pg synthesis in the icb by a single topical ocular administration of  xxxd2710xxx  was more closely examined using time
points of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 min post dosing. total iris/ ciliary body pg production rapidly declined in both  xxxd2710xxx  treated and diclofenac treated animals
(figure 2). at the earliest time point examined (5 min) diclofenac (0.1%) and
 xxxd2710xxx  (0.1%) reduced total pg synthesis by 41% and 58%, respectively. the
inhibition of pg synthesis following diclofenac administration increased little
thereafter, with peak inhibition (53%) observed 80 min after dosing. in contrast, animals receiving a single dose of 0.1%  xxxd2710xxx  exhibited progressively
greater inhibition of total pg synthesis by the iris/ ciliary body with time. greater
than 95% inhibition was achieved 80 min following administration.  xxxd2710xxx

was equally efficacious when employed at a concentration of 0.05%. although
diclofenac exhibits greater intrinsic co activity than the active metabolite of
 xxxd2710xxx  (table 1),  xxxd2710xxx  is a more efficacious in vivo inhibitor of pg
synthesis when applied topically to the eye.
the duration of pge2 synthesis inhibition in the iris/ ciliary body was then
monitored through 6 h following a single topical ocular dose of  xxxd2710xxx  or
diclofenac (figure 3). in this study pge2 formation was determined by ria
rather than by [1–14 c]-eicosanoid formation by radio-hplc. diclofenac (0.1%)
abolished iris/ ciliary body synthesis of pge2 . this level of inhibition was sustained for ≈20 min following drug administration. thereafter, inhibition of pge2
synthesis declined steadily to 26% six h after dosing. in contrast,  xxxd2710xxx 
(0.1%) exhibited a somewhat slower onset (20 min) to maximal suppression
(90%–95%) of pge2 synthesis. however, this level of suppression was sustained
for at least 6 h, demonstrating  xxxd2710xxx ’s greater duration of action.
in the retina/ choroid (figure 4) inhibition of pge2 synthesis was observed
earlier in  xxxd2710xxx  treated animals (40 min) than in diclofenac treated animals
(80 min) following a single topical ocular dose (0.1%). whereas the iris/ ciliary
body showed nearly complete inhibition of pge2 synthesis immediately following  xxxd2710xxx  treatment, in the retina/ choroid pge2 synthesis was partially suppressed (55%) at 40 min following dosing. this level of inhibition was sustained

pge2 production was assessed by ria. the rate of pge2 production of tissue homogenates from
the iris/ ciliary body of untreated (control) animals was 202 ± 74 ng/ 10 min/ mg protein (n c 32).
each data point represents the mean ± sd (n c 8).

for a period of 4 h. thereafter pge2 inhibition declined to 13% eight hours after
dosing. diclofenac (0.1%) treatment produced only 20–32% inhibition of pge2
synthesis. this level of inhibition was observed 80 min through 4 h following
drug administration. eight h post diclofenac dosing there was no inhibition of
pge2 synthesis by retina/ choroid.
inhibition of blood aqueous barrier breakdown. to evaluate the antiinflammatory activity of topical ocular  xxxd2710xxx  animals were dosed 45 min
prior to paracentesis with test compound or vehicle. aqueous humor protein and
pge2 concentrations were assessed thirty min following paracentesis.
a single, prophylactic topical ocular dose of  xxxd2710xxx  (0.1%) significantly reduced paracentesis-induced accumulation of protein (61% reduction)
and nearly abolished pge2 accumulation (98% reduction) in the aqueous humor
(figure 5). this inhibitory effect was very similar to that observed with 0.1%
diclofenac. amfenac (0.1%) inhibited aqueous humor protein accumulation by
59%.
the onset and duration of action of a single 0.1% dose of  xxxd2710xxx  was

min through 4 h post-dosing, but failed to do so at the 8 h time point.
 xxxd2710xxx ’s inhibition of protein extravasation in the anterior chamber of
the eye was shown to be concentration dependent (figure 7). significant antiinflammatory activity was observed at concentrations as low as 0.01%. maximum efficacy in this model was noted at 0.03% and was maintained at doses
up to 0.3%. this maximum efficacy was comparable to that observed with
diclofenac 0.1%.

discussion
classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with arylacetic acid structure
are potent inhibitors of pgh synthase that promote a time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme with increasing time of drug exposure (12). this inhibitory

characteristic is abolished with chemical modification of the carboxyl functional
group (i.e., esterification) (12). the latter behavior is demonstrated in the present
study for  xxxd2710xxx , representing the amide analog of amfenac. as an amide
analog,  xxxd2710xxx  exhibits weak intrinsic pgh synthase-1 inhibitory potency
(ic50 c 64.3 mm), whereas its free carboxylic acid counterpart, amfenac, causes
potent inhibition of both pgh synthase-1 (cox-1) (ic50 c 0.25 mm) and pgh
synthase-2 (cox-2) (ic50 c 0.15 mm). this potency in suppressing cox-2 suggests that  xxxd2710xxx  may have advantages over non-cox-2 inhibitory nsaids
in treating existing ocular inflammatory conditions.
when tested for anti-inflammatory activity in a trauma-induced (paracentesis) rabbit model of ocular inflammation, topical prophylactic administration of
 xxxd2710xxx  (0.1%) yielded efficacy equal to that of the arylacetic acids, amfenac
(0.1%) and diclofenac (0.1%), the reference compound, in suppressing both
pge2 (>95%) and protein accumulation (61%) in the aqueous humor. this
observation suggested that  xxxd2710xxx , which exhibits only weak intrinsic cox
inhibitory activity, readily undergoes bioactivation to amfenac by intraocular
hydrolases following penetration of external ocular barriers. results obtained
from the ex vivo experiments described confirmed the bioavailability of an active
cyclooxygenase inhibitor following topical dosing. not only was pg synthesis reduced in iris/ ciliary body tissue removed from animals dosed topically
with  xxxd2710xxx , but significant reduction in pg production was observed in
retina/ choroid removed following topical dosing.

anti-inflammatory efficacy of  xxxd2710xxx  in acute ocular inflammation

367

superior pharmacodynamics were apparent for  xxxd2710xxx  compared to
diclofenac in these studies. this was evident by both a more efficient suppression of all pg produced by the iris/ ciliary body (table 2 and figure 5) and a
longer duration of pg synthesis suppression (figure 6). the relatively fast recovery of pg synthesis of the iris/ ciliary body observed with diclofenac treatment
further indicates a relatively short half-life of diclofenac in tissues of the anterior
chamber. this is indicated by a 70% recovery in pg synthetic capacity of the
iris/ ciliary body 6 h following a single topical ocular dose of diclofenac. based
on an estimated 7.7 h time interval for half-maximal recovery of iris/ ciliary
body synthesis of pgh following self-catalyzed inactivation upon paracentesis
(9), there seems to be insufficient diclofenac available in the anterior chamber
and/ or iris/ ciliary body to inhibit newly expressed enzyme, even as early as
40 min after topical dosing (figure 6). this is clearly in contrast to  xxxd2710xxx ,
which exhibited sustained inhibition of pg synthesis through 6 h following a single topical ocular dose. an assessment of the in vitro conversion of  xxxd2710xxx 
to amfenac in corneal tissue slices, iris/ ciliary body, and retina/ choroid isolated
from nza rabbits and from human cadaver eyes confirms the bioconversion of
 xxxd2710xxx  to amfenac (13).
most interesting is the observation that a single topical ocular dose of
 xxxd2710xxx  (0.1%) caused a significant suppression in pge2 synthesis (55%)
of the retina/ choroid of the nza rabbit. this level of suppression was
sustained for a period of 4 h prior to returning to baseline levels. these
results indicate that topical ocular  xxxd2710xxx  is readily bioavailable to the
retina/ choroid, likely through both corneal and scleral absorption. following
absorption, hydrolytic conversion to amfenac is readily accomplished by the
retina/ choroid which exhibits the highest ocular levels of hydrolase activity (6.5
nm/ min/ mg). diclofenac, on the other hand, promoted only a marginal suppression (20%–32%) of pge2 synthesis over the same time course, indicating lower
retinal bioavailability.
previously published studies have demonstrated that trauma elicited immediate and transient pge2 synthesis in the anterior chamber of the eye associated
with breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier (9). aqueous pge2 levels were
significantly elevated within 10 min post paracentesis, but decreased steadily
beyond 20 min. following a brief delay, blood-aqueous barrier breakdown, as
indicated by the accumulation of vascular derived protein in aqueous humor samples, peaked by 30 min, with a gradual decline thereafter. the characteristics
of this ocular inflammatory response suggested that studies evaluating topical
ocular efficacy of pg synthesis inhibitors should employ a drug pre-treatment
regimen (9). therefore, in the present studies, animals were pretreated with a
single topical ocular administration 45 min prior to injury. effects of the drugs
on aqueous humor protein and pge2 concentrations were compared at the peak
of the inflammatory response, 30 min following paracentesis.

gamache et al.

 xxxd2710xxx  produced concentration dependent inhibition of trauma-induced
inflammation following a single topical ocular administration. significant
anti-inflammatory efficacy was observed at concentrations as low as 0.01%.
while  xxxd2710xxx  0.1% and voltaren were indistinguishable in efficacy,
 xxxd2710xxx  exhibited superior pharmacodynamic properties in these rabbit studies.  xxxd2710xxx  maintained significant activity through 8 h, while voltaren was
inactive by this time. these results demonstrate a superior duration of action
for  xxxd2710xxx  compared with voltaren. also, this investigation suggests that the
drugs display a comparable onset of action despite the topical application of a
prodrug in the case of  xxxd2710xxx . this early onset of action of the amide prodrug
is consistent with rapid corneal penetration and subsequent conversion to the free
acid in the iris/ ciliary body and retina/ choroid, as described by graff et al (13).
rapid corneal penetration favors the accumulation of adequate  xxxd2710xxx  concentrations at the iris-ciliary body, which comprises the blood-aqueous barrier
and a site of significant pg synthesis (14).
the results obtained from investigations of the intrinsic pgh synthase activity and inhibition of pg synthesis in ocular tissue of the rabbit following a single topical ocular dose, and efficacy to inhibit trauma-induced ocular inflammation in the rabbit, demonstrate that  xxxd2710xxx  exhibits ocular anti-inflammatory
properties superior to diclofenac. although  xxxd2710xxx  requires intraocular bioactivation to become an effective pgh synthase inhibitor, its superior penetration
of both the cornea and scleral tissue allows for an apparently greater intraocular drug accumulation than is achieved with diclofenac. the favorable ocular
penetration of  xxxd2710xxx  and its rapid intraocular metabolism to amfenac at target sites readily overcomes the two-fold greater pgh synthase inhibitor potency
advantage of diclofenac, thus providing equal or greater anti-inflammatory efficacy and greater duration of pg synthesis suppression in preclinical animal models than observed with diclofenac. importantly, clinical evaluation of  xxxd2710xxx 
in post cataract surgery inflammation demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory
efficacy (15).
in addition to suppressing inflammation in the anterior chamber, results suggest that  xxxd2710xxx  may be employed in conditions involving the posterior segment of the eye. cystoid macular edema is the most frequent cause of vision
loss following cataract extraction (16). characterized by cystic swelling of the
macula associated with vascular leakage as detected by fluorescein angiography
(17), this condition is evident postoperatively in 50 to 70% of cataract patients.
the observation that cyclooxygenase inhibitors can attenuate post-surgical macular edema (18, 19) warrants an efficacy assessment of  xxxd2710xxx , which is
readily bioavailable to the posterior segment following topical ocular administration. suppression of pg synthesis may attenuate not only the post-surgical
edematous response but also the elevation of vasodilatory pg observed preclinically in the retinal vasculature under diabetic conditions (20). a key finding in

anti-inflammatory efficacy of  xxxd2710xxx  in acute ocular inflammation

369

the present studies is the demonstration that topical application of  xxxd2710xxx 
produced significant inhibition of pg synthesis by retinal and choroidal tissue
ex vivo. diclofenac (0.1%) was inactive in posterior ocular tissues when tested
under identical conditions. therefore, the preclinical pharmacodynamic profile
exhibited by  xxxd2710xxx  indicates the potential to suppress pg-mediated inflammation in both anterior segment tissues and retinal tissue following topical ocular
administration.
