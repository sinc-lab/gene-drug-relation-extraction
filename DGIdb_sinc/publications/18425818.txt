the cytosine analogues 5-azacytosine ( xxxd253xxx ) and 20 -deoxy5- xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ) are the currently most advanced drugs
for epigenetic cancer therapies. these compounds function as
dna methyltransferase inhibitors and have shown substantial
potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor
genes in vitro. however, it has been difﬁcult to deﬁne the mode of
action of these drugs in patients and it appears that clinical
responses are inﬂuenced both by epigenetic alterations and by apoptosis induction. to maximize the clinical efﬁcacy of  xxxd253xxx 
and  xxxd1823xxx  it will be important to understand the molecular
changes induced by these drugs. in this review, we examine the
pharmacological properties of azanucleosides and their interactions with various cellular pathways. because  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  are prodrugs, an understanding of the cellular mechanisms
mediating transmembrane transport and metabolic activation will
be critically important for optimizing patient responses. we also
discuss the mechanism of dna methyltransferase inhibition and
emphasize the need for the identiﬁcation of predictive biomarkers
for the further advancement of epigenetic therapies.

more than 40 years ago, the azanucleosides  xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ) and 20 -deoxy- xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ) were developed
as classical cytostatic agents.1 several years later, it was shown
that these compounds inhibit dna methylation in human cell
lines, which provided a mechanistic explanation for their differentiation-modulating activity.2 in addition, this observation also initiated the development of azanucleosides as epigenetic drugs. after substantial reﬁnements in their clinical dosing schedules, both
 xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  have now shown signiﬁcant clinical
beneﬁts in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (mds), a
preleukemic bone marrow disorder.3,4 as a consequence, these
drugs have now received fda approval for the treatment of mds.
there are substantial ongoing efforts to identify and develop novel
dna methyltransferase inhibitors.5,6 however, the currently
available compounds appear to have weaker gene reactivation
potencies than azanucleosides7,8 and none of the candidate drugs
has reached an advanced clinical testing stage for epigenetic indications yet. this has established  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  as
archetypal drugs for epigenetic cancer therapies.9
despite the renewed interest in  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx , surprisingly little is known about the molecular mode of action of
these drugs. it is clear that azanucleosides have cytotoxic effects
and that they can cause dna demethylation, but the relationships
between these characteristics and their respective signiﬁcance for
clinical responses has not been established yet. a comprehensive
understanding of drug characteristics will be critically important
for deﬁning their modes of action and to further advance their clinical development.

demethylation therapies: proof of mechanism
and proof of concept
azanucleosides are established molecular tools for the induction of dna demethylation in cellular model systems. however, it
is also known that high doses of these drugs can induce pronounced toxicities in patients. when dosing schedules were
adapted to optimize epigenetic effects it became increasingly
publication of the international union against cancer

important to provide proof of mechanism data, i.e., to demonstrate
dna demethylation in patients. several studies have now shown
that  xxxd1823xxx  can induce signiﬁcant demethylation in the
approved indication10,11 and additional results suggest that  xxxd253xxx  might have comparable epigenetic effects in patients.12,13
the rationale behind demethylation therapies is the ability of
dna methyltransferase inhibitors to revert hypermethylationinduced gene silencing.14 hypermethylation-induced gene silencing of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes plays a
fundamental role in human tumorigenesis.15 the reversion of
these epigenetic mutations can therefore restore proliferation control and apoptosis sensitivity. the identiﬁcation of such events in
patients undergoing demethylation therapy has been notably difﬁcult. most studies in this context have focused on the p15 tumor
suppressor gene, which can be hypermethylated in mds and
aml patients and can be demethylated and reactivated in patients
undergoing  xxxd1823xxx  therapy.16 similar observations were also
made in other clinical studies with  xxxd253xxx , but a close connection between demethylation and reactivation of p15 and clinical
responses could not be conﬁrmed.12,13 the identiﬁcation of hypermethylated genes that become demethylated and reactivated by
drug treatment and the establishment of statistically robust associations between epigenetic reactivation events and patient
responses will be an important area for future research.
chemical stability of  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx 
azanucleoside drugs are widely considered to be unstable, and
have therefore been handled with considerable care, both in the
laboratory and in the clinic. in alkaline solutions azanucleosides
undergo a rapid and reversible opening of the 5-azacytosine ring,
followed by irreversible decomposition.17,18 in acidic solutions
the glycosidic bond of azanucleosides is cleaved, which also interferes with a potential oral administration of these drugs.19
to determine the half-life times of  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx 
in neutral aqueous solutions, we used a capillary electrophoresisbased analytical assay. both  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx , respectively, were dissolved in neutral buffer, together with a chemically
stable internal standard (adenine). solutions were stored at 4, 20
and 37°c, respectively, and samples were taken at various time
points. the results revealed that both drugs were stable at 4°c
with half-life times of 21 days ( xxxd253xxx ) and 7 days ( xxxd1823xxx ; fig. 1a). at 20°c, compound degradation became more
rapid and half-life times were calculated to be 37 hr for  xxxd253xxx  and 96 hr for  xxxd1823xxx  (fig. 1a). at 37°c the half-life times
were 7 hr for  xxxd253xxx  and 21 hr for  xxxd1823xxx  (fig. 1a). a
very similar half-life time (20 hr) for  xxxd1823xxx  solutions stored at
37°c was also found in an independent, recent study.21 our results

the time indicated. the medium was then exchanged for drug-free
medium and cells were grown for a total of 48 hr.

then diluted to 0.45 mg/ml and mixed with adenine as an internal

indicate a considerable chemical stability of azanucleosides at
temperatures that are relevant for their general handling and use.
to conﬁrm the stability of azanucleoside solutions we tested
their ability to inhibit dna methylation in the human hct116 colon carcinoma cell line. drug samples were stored for 24 hr at
220, 4, 20 or 37°c and then added to the tissue culture medium.
cells were harvested after 72 hr and their global dna methylation
level was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. this revealed that
azanucloside solutions stored at room temperature were still effective in inhibiting genomic cytosine methylation (fig. 1b) and provided an important conﬁrmation for the relative stability of these
drugs.

drug pharmacokinetics
in vivo, several additional factors limit the stability and bioavailability of azanucleosides. reﬁnements in dosing and administration have continuously improved the clinical performance of

these drugs. for example, it has been shown that subcutaneous
administration of  xxxd253xxx  results in an 2-fold higher beta
(substance elimination) half-life time compared to intravenous
administration.22
both  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  show wide distribution in body
ﬂuids of rabbits and dogs, with a comparably low alpha (substance
distribution) half-life time of about 5 min.23 nevertheless, both
compounds are rapidly cleared from systemic circulation. systemic clearance exceeds the glomerular ﬁltration rate and total renal blood ﬂow, which suggests an important role of nonrenal elimination. in this context it has been proposed that deamination by
 xxxg400xxx  in the human liver and spleen appears to be an
important pathway.24 a detailed quantiﬁcation of  xxxd253xxx 
plasma levels in 3 patients treated s.c. with 25 mg/m2 showed a
maximal plasma concentration of 374 ng/ml (1.5 lm), which
occurred in the ﬁrst hour after administration and the observed
beta half-life time in plasma was 1.8 hr.25 when patients were
treated with the established standard treatment schedule for mds
patients (75 mg/m2), plasma levels of  xxxd253xxx  in the range of
3–11 lm could be achieved.22 similar analyses with samples from
aml patients that had been treated intravenously with 15 mg/m2
 xxxd1823xxx  revealed a maximum concentration of 103 ng/ml (0.5
lm) and a beta half-life time of less than 1.5 hr.26
the peak plasma concentrations observed in patients are comparable to the concentrations that are being used to achieve dna
demethylation in vitro.8 however, substance elimination half-life
times in patients are substantially shorter than the drug incubation
times used for in vitro experiments (usually 48 or 72 hr). we
therefore analyzed the possibility that short incubation times in
drug-containing medium would be sufﬁcient for the induction of
 xxxd253xxx -mediated dna demethylation. to this end, hct116
cells were incubated with 2 lm  xxxd253xxx . after various time
points ranging from 5 min to 48 hr, cells were washed and incubated in drug-free medium for the remaining time until the end of
the experiment was reached (after 48 hr). analysis of global cytosine methylation levels in genomic dna from these cells failed to
indicate any demethylation after 5 min of drug incubation, but
showed progressive demethylation after 1, 6.5 and 48 hr (fig. 2).
the maximum demethylation was observed after 48 hr, which
conﬁrmed that prolonged drug exposures cause more pronounced
demethylation responses.27
because of the association between length of drug exposure
and dna demethylation, various clinical studies have tried to
maximize demethylation responses in patients by continuous
infusion of azanucleosides over several days. analysis of dna

methylation levels showed that continuous administration of  xxxd1823xxx  caused pronounced demethylation, but the study design did
not permit the analysis of correlations between demethylation and
clinical responses.28 more comprehensive studies may become
feasible through the development of oral  xxxd1823xxx .29 alternatively, more prolonged drug exposure might also be achieved by
chemical modiﬁcations that improve plasma stability of azanucleosides. one example for this approach is the development of
the  xxxd1823xxx -containing dinucleotide s110. this compound
showed comparable growth inhibiting and demethylating effects
in tumor cell lines and improved resistance to enzymatic deamination.21
a potential safety concern for continuous dna demethylation
is the increased induction of illegitimate transcription events.
mouse models with strongly and permanently reduced dna methylation levels have shown genetic ampliﬁcation and insertional
activation of oncogenic loci.30,31 these events are probably linked
to the epigenetic reactivation of mobile dna elements and need
to be monitored and minimized during demethylation therapy. in
this context, it is interesting to notice that clinical  xxxd1823xxx 
administration schedules with relatively high dose intensity have
shown better response rates than schedules that continuously
maintain low plasma drug levels.32 thus, downstream effects of
demethylation might also be important for clinical drug activity
and optimized clinical schedules will probably cause balanced
dna demethylation and apoptosis induction.

cellular uptake of azanucleosides
conceivably, the effectiveness of azanucleoside therapy is also
inﬂuenced by the relative transport capacities of the target tissue.
of particular interest are the membrane transporters that mediate
cellular drug uptake. early studies in a leukemic mouse model
showed a connection between  xxxd253xxx  resistance and impaired
uptake of uridine and cytidine, which supported an important role
of cellular transport mechanisms in mediating drug effects.33
however, the role of transport processes in the treatment with azanucleosides has not been characterized on the molecular level yet.
in human cells, four different classes of proteins mediate the
transport of nucleosides across membranes (fig. 3)34: (i) equlibrative uniporters (slc29a family), (ii) substrate exchange transporters (slc22 and slc15 family), (iii) concentrative transporters
(slca28 family), and (iv) atp-dependent exporters (abc family). the transporter family members responsible for equilibrative
uniport (ents/slc29a) or the concentrative uptake (cnts/
slc28a) of nucleosides have been directly linked to the uptake
of chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogues in the treatment of
leukemias.35–38
experimental data from in vitro treated patient cells showed a
signiﬁcant correlation between the expression levels of nucleoside
transporters and the sensitivity to nucleoside chemotherapeutics,
like gemcitabine,36,39,40 ﬂudarabine37 or  xxxd1790xxx ,35 which
might indicate a role of these proteins in mediating azanucleoside
uptake. a statistically signiﬁcant correlation between the expression level of the equilibrative transporter ent-1 and the sensitivity of ex vivo cultivated mononuclear cells from 50 aml patients
could also be demonstrated for  xxxd1823xxx .35 similarly, an arraybased study of transport-associated genes in 60 human cancer
cell lines also identiﬁed a positive correlation between ent-1
expression and  xxxd253xxx  chemosensitivity.41 a role of ent-1
in  xxxd253xxx  uptake was also suggested by the observation that
 xxxd253xxx -induced cytotoxicity could be reduced by nitrobenzylmercaptopurine  xxxd2246xxx , a speciﬁc inhibitor of ent-1.41
nevertheless, functional data demonstrating a role of speciﬁc
nucleoside transporters in mediating the cellular uptake of azanucleosides is still lacking. this is an important area for future
research, because nucleoside transporters expression patterns
could potentially be used as predictive biomarkers for therapy
responses with nucleoside therapeutics.42

figure 3 – membrane transport and intracellular metabolism of
azanucleosides. four candidate transporter protein families (black and
gray arrows) are believed to mediate the transport of nucleosides and
nucleoside metabolites across the cell membrane (double line). after
cellular uptake,  xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ) and  xxxd1823xxx  (5-aza-dcr)
are modiﬁed by different metabolic pathways. it is assumed that 80–
90% of  xxxd253xxx  is incorporated into rna, because ribonucleotide
reductase limits the conversion of 5-aza-ribonucleotides to 5-azadeoxyribonucleotides.

intracellular metabolism of azanucleosides
after their cellular uptake, azanucleosides need to be activated and
metabolically converted into the active nucleotide for dna methylation inhibition, 5-aza-20 - xxxd1836xxx -50 -triphosphate (fig. 3).
a ﬁrst limiting step in this cascade is the atp-dependent posphorylation of the nucleoside to the monophosporylated nucleotide. it
is generally assumed that this reaction is catalyzed by different
enzymes for  xxxd253xxx  (uridine-cytidine kinase) and  xxxd1823xxx 
( xxxg611xxx ), and phosphorylation of  xxxd1823xxx  by
 xxxg611xxx  has been conﬁrmed experimentally.43 however, recombinant human uridine cytidine kinase 1 and 2 enzymes
failed to phosphorylate  xxxd253xxx , while showing detectable activity for cytidine, uridine and some derivatives.44 these results
suggested that  xxxd253xxx  phosphorylation is mediated by different enzymes. selection for  xxxd1823xxx  resistance in rat leukemic
cell lines has been shown to be associated with the occurrence of
mutations in the  xxxg611xxx  gene.45 this suggested that
 xxxg611xxx  plays an essential role in the metabolic activation of  xxxd1823xxx . similarly, enzymes that negatively regulate
the conversion of azanucleosides to azanucleotides could also play
an important role in modulating drug responses. it has been shown
that  xxxg400xxx  can deaminate  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx 
to inactive aza-uradine nucleosides,24 and retroviral overexpression of human  xxxg400xxx  in murine cells caused a signiﬁcant drug resistance against  xxxd1823xxx .46 it should be noted, however, that there is presently no published data supporting a role of
human  xxxg400xxx  or  xxxg611xxx  in modifying
 xxxd1823xxx  responses in patients.
because of its deoxyribonucleoside structure,  xxxd1823xxx  is generally believed to be a more potent dna methylation inhibitor

11

than the  xxxd2246xxx  analogue  xxxd253xxx . early incorporation
studies in l1210 leukemic cells have shown that 80–90% of  xxxd253xxx  are incorporated directly into rna.47 a rate-limiting step
for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides is
the activity of the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme. surprisingly,
treatment of cancer cell lines with hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide
reductase inhibitor, blocked the ability of both  xxxd253xxx  and
 xxxd1823xxx  to induce dna demethylation.48 this block was linked
to the overall depletion of the nucleotide pool and a concomitant
cell cycle arrest. it will be important to use more speciﬁc inhibitors for similar experiments and to investigate the role of the
nucleotide metabolism as a potential response modiﬁer in demethylation therapies.

incorporation of azanucleosides into nucleic
acids and dna demethylation
after azanucleosides have been metabolized to 5-aza-20 - xxxd1836xxx -triphosphate, they can become substrates for the dna
replication machinery and will be incorporated into dna, where
azacytosine can substitute for cytosine. azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized by the dna methyltransferases as natural
substrate and the enzymes will initiate the methylation reaction by
a nucleophilic attack. this results in the establishment of a covalent bond between the carbon-6 atom of the cytosine ring and the
enzyme.49,50 the bond is normally resolved by beta-elimination
through the carbon-5 atom, but the reaction is blocked with azacytosine, where carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen (fig. 4a). thus,
the enzyme remains covalently bound to dna and its dna methyltransferase function is blocked. in addition, the covalent protein
adduction also compromises the functionality of dna and triggers
dna damage signaling, resulting in the degradation of trapped
dna methyltransferases (fig. 4b). as a consequence, methylation
marks become lost during dna replication.
covalent trapping of mouse dnmt1 has been conﬁrmed experimentally by photobleaching approaches and has been shown to be
dependent on the presence of the catalytic cysteine residue that is
required for covalent complex formation.51 a different study indicated that the  xxxd253xxx -dependent degradation of dna methyltransferases was not affected by mutations in the catalytic cysteine
residue of human dnmt1 and that the drug induced speciﬁc proteasomal targeting of the enzyme.52 whereas the latter results are
difﬁcult to reconcile with the covalent trapping paradigm, they
raised the possibility that additional pathways could also contribute to azanucleoside-induced dna demethylation. in this respect
it is interesting to notice that a recent study has provided detailed
insight into the dna damage response induced by  xxxd1823xxx .53 it
was shown that  xxxd1823xxx  caused the formation of double strand
breaks in human cancer cell lines and that dnmt1 might play a
role in mediating the cellular damage response to the drug. the
induction of dna damage by  xxxd1823xxx  (and, presumably, also
by  xxxd253xxx ), combined with a role of dnmt1 in dna repair54
indicates that drug-induced demethylation patterns might be inﬂuenced by dna repair mechanisms.
to characterize the mechanisms of drug-induced demethylation
in greater detail, it will be critically important to quantitatively
determine azanucleoside incorporation rates into genomic dna.
an early study with 10t1/2 mouse cells and radioactively labeled
 xxxd1823xxx  suggested that the substitution rate of 5-azacytosine for
cytosine in genomic dna could be as high as 10%.55 however,
the corresponding assays cannot be easily adapted to the requirements of clinical sample analysis and most laboratories use the
drug-dependent depletion of dnmt1 protein as a non-quantitative
substitute assay for conﬁrming azanucleoside incorporation.56,57 it
should be feasible to establish analytical methods for the quantitative determination of azacytosine levels in genomic dna and it
will be interesting to evaluate this parameter as a potential biomarker for response prediction.

figure 4 – trapping mechanism of azacytosine. (a) a nucleophilic
attack of the protein-thiol group (from a catalytic cysteine residue of
the dna methyltransferase enzyme,  xxxg644xxx ) at the c6 position of cytosine drives the subsequent transfer of the methyl group from the
methyl donor s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx . the transfer proceeds through
a covalent complex at position c6 between the dna and the  xxxg644xxx 
protein. the complex is resolved through a b-elimination reaction
resulting in the release of the active dna methyltransferase enzyme.
(b) mechanism-based inhibition of dnmts by azacytosine-containing
dna. the covalent complex at c6 cannot be resolved through b-elimination, because of the presence of a nitrogen atom at position 5. covalently trapped dnmts are degraded, resulting in the depletion of
cellular dnmts.

outlook
understanding the mode of action of azanucleosides will
require continued translational approaches on the molecular and
the clinical level. it will be important to identify and validate biomarkers that predict the response of patients. depending on their
association with epigenetic regulation (i.e., demethylation of speciﬁc markers) or apoptosis induction (i.e., activation of damage
signaling), these biomarkers might provide detailed insight into
the cellular pathways that are inﬂuenced by azanucleosides. similarly, determining the mechanisms of azanucleoside resistance and
sensitivity will ultimately allow a better understanding of the
drugs’ mode(s) of action and facilitate the development of molecular markers for response prediction. for example, it will be inter-

esting to analyze potential associations between clinical responses
and polymorphisms in the genes encoding the transporters for azanucleoside uptake. lastly, it will be important to obtain a better
understanding of the drug-induced epigenetic changes in patients.
genome-wide methylation proﬁling technologies should be used
in order to maximize epigenetic reprogramming events at silenced
tumor suppressor genes and to minimize epigenetic side effects,
like the activation of silenced retroelements.
