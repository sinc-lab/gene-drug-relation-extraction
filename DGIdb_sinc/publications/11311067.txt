with a novel assay using isolated ferret detrusor to estimate  xxxg93xxx  agonistic activity,
we found that a series of glycine derivatives of  xxxd3130xxx , a  xxxg92xxx  agonist, are potent
 xxxg93xxx  agonists, with excellent selectivity versus  xxxg836xxx  and beta2 subtypes. substitution of
halogens in the phenyl ring increased potency and selectivity for the  xxxg93xxx , and this
was dependent upon the position of the halogens. the chlorine-substituted derivatives 3f-i
exhibited potent  xxxg93xxx -mediated relaxation of ferret detrusor (ec50 ) 0.93, 11, 14,
and 160 nm) and higher potency at  xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptors than at  xxxg836xxx  or beta2. the intravenous
administration of 3h significantly reduced the urinary bladder pressure in anesthetized male
rats (ed50 ) 48 µg/kg) without cardiovascular side effects. this article is the first report of
structure-activity relationships (sar) concerning  xxxg93xxx  agonists as agents for the
treatment of urinary frequency and incontinence.
introduction
in 1984,  xxxg838xxx -adrernergic receptors (ar) were proposed
as a third group of beta-ars in addition to the  xxxg836xxx - and beta2ars found in rat adipose tissue utilizing various
beta-agonists.1-4 in 1989, the primary structure of the  xxxg93xxx  was identified and characterized using cloning and
molecular pharmacological techniques.5-7  xxxg838xxx -ars are
g-protein-linked receptors. like other beta-ars, it has a
seven transmembrane-spanning structure and plays a
significant role in regulating lipolysis and thermogenesis in rodent and human adipose tissue. moreover,
studies of  xxxg838xxx -ar mrna demonstrated that  xxxg838xxx -ars exist
in the human heart, gall bladder, gastrointestinal (gi)
tract, and prostate in addition to adipocytes.8 these
findings encouraged us to look for potent  xxxg838xxx -ar agonists
to treat various metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases,
such as obesity, diabetes, and irritable bowel syndrome.2
recently, it has been suggested that  xxxg838xxx -ars exist in the
human detrusor and its relaxation is mediated mainly
via  xxxg838xxx -ars.9-12 in the urinary bladder, urine storage on
a peripheral receptor level is controlled by  xxxg838xxx -ars, which
accept signals from sympathetic nerves in the human
detrusor. therefore, we thought that potent, selective
 xxxg838xxx -ar agonists might provide a new approach for the
treatment of urinary bladder dysfunction, such as
urinary frequency and incontinence. although a number
of antimuscarinic drugs are widely prescribed for such
diseases,13 their antimuscarinic activity has unacceptable side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation.
in addition, antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated
in patients with urinary retention, because they inhibit
the micturation pressure. it is noteworthy that  xxxg838xxx -ar
agonists do not possess such adverse effects. however,
if  xxxg838xxx -ar activity cannot be separated from  xxxg836xxx - and beta2* to whom correspondence should be addressed. tel:

ar activity,  xxxg838xxx -ar agonists would have unfavorable
effects, such as tachycardia or tremor. to find drugs
without such adverse effects, this study evaluated the
 xxxg838xxx -ar activity of compounds using the ferret detrusor
in a novel assay.14 we also examined  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar
agonistic activity using rat atria and uteri.
first, we evaluated some beta-ar agonists that are used
clinically or preclinically. as shown in table 2,  xxxd2401xxx  (a nonselective beta-ar agonist), ritodrine15 (a  xxxg92xxx  agonist), and cl31624316 (a  xxxg838xxx -ar agonist) relax the
ferret detrusor via  xxxg838xxx -ar activation.14 brl373443,17 (a
 xxxg838xxx -ar agonist) produced the greatest relaxation and full
agonistic activity. in comparison, the n-phenylglycine
derivatives (3) produced sufficient detrusor-relaxation
mediated via  xxxg838xxx -ar and exhibited  xxxg838xxx -ar selectivity
against effects mediated via  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar. moreover,
most of them behaved as full agonists (80-100% maximum response relative to  xxxd2401xxx ). thus, the
n-phenylglycine derivatives 3 appear to be a new class

scheme 1. general method for compounds 3a

ethyl alcohols described above were substituted by
bromine using ph3p and cbr4 to give the phenethyl
bromide intermediates.
as mentioned above, n-(2-chlorophenyl)glycine derivatives 2f,g cannot be synthesized in the same manner
as the others, since selective n-monoalkylation of the
2-chloroaniline derivatives 919 with ethyl 2-bromoacetate was not possible. this failure was assumed to
be caused by similar alkylation rates for n-monoalkylation and n,n-dialkylation leading to n,n-dialkylation.
in fact, this reaction consumed few 2-chloroaniline
derivatives while using ethyl 2-bromoacetate in an
amount equivalent to 9 and afforded only n,n-dialkylated aniline derivatives when using ethyl 2-bromoacetate in an amount exceeding twice the equivalent to
9. nagaraj et al. reported that 2-substituted anilines,
particularly 2-chloro or 2-nitroaniline, are more liable
to undergo n,n-diacetylation to give the n-phenyldiacetamide derivative than unsubstituted ones.20 they
assumed that the facility of n,n-dialkylation is determined by the inductive and steric effects of the substituents at the ortho-position on the aniline. this hypothesis might also hold in our case of n-alkylation, although
the reaction type is quite distinct from n-acylation.
therefore, we planned to improve the n-monoalkylation
via trifluoroacetoanilide (10) as shown in scheme 3.
acidic protection of the hydroxy group of 9 with dihydro2h-pyran (dhp) followed by regioselective acylation
with trifluoroacetoanhydride gave the trifluoroacetoanilide (10). n-alkylation via a metal salt of the amide
10 with sodium hydride gave 11. cleavage of the
trifluoroacetyl group under alkaline conditions and
cleavage of the thp group with p- xxxd1526xxx  followed this.
the hydroxy group was finally replaced by bromine
using ph3p and cbr4 to give the desired intermediates
2f,g.
the synthesis of the isobutyrate intermediates 2o,p
was investigated in a manner similar to the preparation
of 2-phenoxyisobutyrate such as fibrates,21 which are
agents used to treat hyperlipidemia (scheme 4). following protection of the hydroxyl group of the nitrobenzene derivatives 13a,b, the o-protected compounds
14a,b were obtained by reduction with zinc followed by
treatment with 1,1,1-trichloro-2-methyl- xxxd2400xxx  (chloreton) to carry out the conversion to n-phenylaminoisobutyric acid.22 esterification with simultaneous cleav-

of  xxxg838xxx -ar agonist that might be useful for the treatment
of urinary diseases, such as urinary frequency and
incontinence, without undesirable side effects. the
synthesis of these compounds (3) and the results of in
vitro and in vivo assays are described in detail in the
following sections.
chemistry
the n-phenylglycine derivatives 3 described herein
(table 1) were prepared from 4′- xxxd2584xxx 
(1) and the correctly substituted aminophenethyl bromide (2) via the corresponding esters, followed by
saponification, as illustrated in scheme 1. optically
 xxxd2299xxx ′- xxxd2584xxx  (1) was obtained by optical resolution of its commercially available racemate
using l-tartaric acid.18
the aminophenethyl bromide (2) incorporated glycine
moieties were generally synthesized as shown in scheme
2 except for the n-(2-chlorophenyl)glycine derivatives
2f,g. the 4′-aminophenethyl derivatives 4a-c were
converted into the corresponding glycine ester analogues
2a and 5b,c by n-alkylation using ethyl 2-bromoacetate.
these were then halogenated using n-halosuccinimide
or hypochlorite esters to give the dichloroaniline derivatives (6 from 5b; 2j,k from 2e following bromination of
5c), mono- and dibromo derivatives (2l,m from 2a), and
monoiodo derivative (2n from 2a). n-phenylglycine
analogues (7, 8b-d) bearing methyl or benzyl groups,
or acetate on nitrogen, were derived using alkylating
agents, such as iodomethane, benzyl bromide, and ethyl
2-bromoacetate. the hydroxy groups of all of the phenscheme 2. synthesis of intermediates 2a

results and discussion
 xxxg838xxx -ar agonists are reported to produce concentrationdependent relaxation of rat, canine, and human detrusor.23 moreover, we found that relaxation of the ferret

detrusor is mediated via  xxxg838xxx -ar, as in the human
detrusor.14 therefore, in this study, we used a ferret
detrusor preparation to estimate the  xxxg838xxx -ar agonistic
activity. the activities of  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar were evaluated
using rat atria or uteri, respectively, according to the
usual method. table 2 summarizes the results of the in
vitro assays of all of our compounds.
the glycine derivative 3a of  xxxd3130xxx  possessed potent
 xxxg838xxx -ar agonistic activity (ec50 ) 24 nm) and selectivity
over the  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar agonist activity ( xxxg836xxx / xxxg838xxx  ) 54-fold
and beta2/ xxxg838xxx  ) 27-fold). introduction of a methyl group on
the nitrogen of the glycine moiety of 3a slightly decreased the efficacy for all beta-ars (3b) and also slightly
altered the selectivity for  xxxg838xxx -ar ( xxxg836xxx / xxxg838xxx  ) 65-fold and beta2/
 xxxg838xxx  ) 31-fold), even though the  xxxg838xxx  potency was reduced.
in contrast, the n-benzylglycine derivative 3d had
marked enhancement of all beta-ar agonistic activity.
thus, 3d had twice the  xxxg838xxx -ar agonistic activity of 3a
(ec50 ) 13 nm) but had low selectivity over the  xxxg836xxx - and
beta2-ar agonistic activity ( xxxg836xxx / xxxg838xxx  ) 12-fold and beta2/ xxxg838xxx  ) 19fold). however, replacement of the n-benzyl group with
a carboxymethyl group (3c) significantly lowered all
beta-ar agonistic activity. the 2- xxxd602xxx 
derivative 3o, with a geminal methyl group on the r
carbon atom of the glycine moiety, had similar  xxxg838xxx -ar
potency (23 nm) and higher selectivity ( xxxg836xxx / xxxg838xxx  and beta2/ xxxg838xxx 
) 478-fold) in comparison with 3a. these initial studies
suggested that substitution of methyl groups on the
glycine moiety significantly increased the selectivity for
 xxxg838xxx -ar, due to a decrease in the  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar agonistic
activity, even when these compounds produced a modest
agonistic effect on  xxxg838xxx -ar.
next, we investigated the effect of halogen substitution on the phenyl ring for  xxxg838xxx -ar agonistic activity and
selectivity. the substitution of halogens, electronwithdrawing groups, changed the potency and selectivity significantly. these changes were dependent upon
the position of the halogen substituents in the phenyl
ring, i.e., ortho- or meta-sites or both. the best rationale
for the sar for the halogen substituent position is found

in the chlorine-substituted compounds. ortho-substitution of chlorine in 3a (3f) enhanced the  xxxg838xxx -ar potency
(ec50 ) 0.93 nm) and selectivity ( xxxg836xxx / xxxg838xxx  ) 2900-fold and
beta2/ xxxg838xxx  ) 3540-fold). on the other hand, the metasubstituted compound 3e was less selective for  xxxg838xxx -ar
than the ortho-chloride 3f, since meta-substitution
enhanced the agonistic activities for all the beta-ars.
substitution of chlorine into the phenyl ring of 3a at
both ortho-positions (3h), i.e., 2,6-dichloro substitution,
also increased the potency and selectivity, while 3h had
a 15-fold lower  xxxg838xxx -ar potency (ec50 ) 14 nm) and lower
selectivity over the  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar agonistic activity by
1.4- and 3.6-fold, respectively, than the monochloride
3f. in contrast, the 2,5-dichloro substitution (3k) only
slightly altered the beta-ar agonistic activity of 3a,
presumably due to the counteracting effect of the
chlorine at each position. in fact, the selectivity of 3k
was similar to that of 3a. the 2,3-dichloro substitution
(3j) unexpectedly increased the  xxxg836xxx -ar agonistic activity
rather than that of beta2- or  xxxg838xxx -ar. the results of substituting chlorines in the phenyl ring indicated that to
improve the potency and selectivity of a  xxxg838xxx -ar agonist

requires mono- or disubstitution of a halogen at the
ortho-position rather than at the meta-position.
the bromine- and iodine-substituted compounds 3l-n
were also  xxxg838xxx -ar agonists that reduced the  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg92xxx  agonistic activities of 3a. it should be noted that
the dibromo-substituted compound 3l retained a high
selectivity ( xxxg836xxx / xxxg838xxx  ) 235-fold and beta2/ xxxg838xxx  ) 32-fold) for  xxxg93xxx . thus, their profiles had a similar trend to those of
the chlorine-substituted compounds. the rank order of
 xxxg838xxx -ar agonistic potency of monohalogen-substituted
compounds was chlorine 3f (ec50 ) 0.93 nm) > bromine
3m (ec50 ) 570 nm) > iodine 3n (ec50 ) 820 nm). this
suggested that the larger the atomic nucleus of the
halogen substituted in the phenyl ring of 3a, the less
potent the  xxxg838xxx -ar agonistic activity induced.
based on this evidence, particularly the enhancement
of the  xxxg838xxx -ar agonistic activity by appropriate chlorine
substitution and of  xxxg838xxx -ar selectivity by methyl substitution on the glycine moiety, further optimization was
carried out by introducing chlorine into the methylsubstituted glycine analogues (3b,o). mono- and dichloro
substituents at the ortho-positions (3g,i) altered the  xxxg838xxx -

both  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ars. therefore, the selectivity for  xxxg93xxx  was greatly improved by the chloro substituent as
compared to 3b. second, monochloro substituents at the
meta-position (3p) increased the agonistic activities of
all the beta-ars ( xxxg838xxx : ec50 ) 5.6 nm) as compared to 3o,
so that there was little improvement in selectivity for
 xxxg838xxx -ar activity over  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar activity. simple
monochloro substitution at the ortho-position improved
both  xxxg838xxx -ar activity and selectivity.
next, we attempted to evaluate the effect of these
compounds on intrabladder pressure in anesthetized
rats. compound 3h, which had one of the best profiles
overall, was selected for this examination, because the
synthesis of 3h was comparatively facile. relaxation of
the rat urinary bladder is mediated via both beta2- and beta3ars.23 therefore, we confirmed the potency of compound
3h in isolated rat detrusor preparations before conducting in vivo experiments. as shown in table 3 and figure
2a, the ec50 of 3h in rat detrusor was 190 nm, and
 xxxd2401xxx  exhibited 19 times more potent relaxing
activity than 3h. in vivo, 3h sufficiently lowered the
intrabladder pressure (ed50 ) 48 µg/kg) and the potency
of  xxxd2401xxx  was 80 times higher than that of 3h.
on the other hand, 3h had no effects on heart rate or
blood pressure, while  xxxd2401xxx  elicited a significant
increase in heart rate and lowering of blood pressure,
as shown in figure 2b,c. these results were due to high
selectivity for  xxxg838xxx -ar, indicating that 3h was a potent,
selective  xxxg838xxx -ar agonist that reduced the urinary bladder
pressure without cardiovascular side effects, which are
mediated by  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar.
in conclusion, a series of glycine-modified  xxxd3130xxx 
was synthesized, and their  xxxg838xxx -ar activity was estimated
in a novel functional assay using the ferret detrusor.
replacement of the phenolic hydroxy group on  xxxd3130xxx 
with glycine enhanced both  xxxg838xxx -ar potency for ferret
detrusor relaxation and selectivity over  xxxg836xxx - and beta2-ar.
additionally, mono- or disubstitution of chlorine at the
ortho-position improved both the  xxxg838xxx -ar activity and
selectivity. in vitro results demonstrated that orthochloro-substituted compounds with or without n-methyl
substituents (3f-i) exhibited the best full agonistic
activity and selectivity for  xxxg838xxx -ar. the in vivo result for
the glycine analogue 3h, a representative of this series,
reflected the in vitro result; namely, 3h lowered the
intrabladder pressure of anesthetized rats without
cardiovascular side effects due to  xxxg836xxx - or beta2-ar mediation.
moreover, 3h showed nearly full agonistic activity to
chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the cloned
human  xxxg838xxx -ar (data not shown). the discovery of these

compounds (3), which are novel selective  xxxg838xxx -ar agonists,
is expected to provide impetus for developing a new
approach in the field of urology. encouraged by these
findings, we are continuing to examine the toxicology,
pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of these
compounds in several species in the hope of finding
useful drugs for the treatment of frequent urination and
urinary incontinence.

in vitro assay for  xxxg93xxx -stimulating effects. urinary bladders of male ferrets (1100-1400 g in body
weight) and male rats (200-380 g in body weight) were
isolated and longitudinal detrusor strips, approximately 10
mm in length and approximately 2 mm in width were
prepared. the experiment was performed according to the
organ bath method. the preparations were suspended in a
krebs solution maintained at 37 °c and continuously gassed
with a mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide under 1
g of tension. detrusor tension were measured isometrically
with a force-displacement transducer (sb-1t; nihon-kohdan,
tokyo, japan) and recorded on a rectigram (rectigraph 8k;
nec san-ei, tokyo, japan). the drug was added cumulatively
to the organ bath every about 5 min. the drug efficacy was
evaluated as the molar concentration of the drug required to
produce 50% of detrusor relaxation before the addition of the
drug. in this experiment, tension of detrusor before the
addition of the drug was expressed as 100% and tension of

novel n-phenylglycine derivatives

maximal relaxation after the addition of 10-5 m concentration
of  xxxd1742xxx  was expressed as 0%.
in vitro assay for  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor-stimulating effects. atria of male sd rats (250-400 g in body weight) were
isolated and the experiment was performed according to the
organ bath method. the preparations were exposed to krebs
solution maintained at 37 °c and gassed with a mixture of
95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide under 0.5 g of tension. the
cardiac contractility was measured isometrically with a forcedisplacement transducer (sb-1t; nihon-kohdan), and heart
rate was recorded on a rectigram via a tachometer (rectigraph
8k; nec san-ei). the drug was added cumulatively to the
magnus bath every 3 min. the drug efficacy was evaluated
as the molar concentration of the drug required to increase
20 beats/minute.
in vitro assay for  xxxg92xxx -stimulating effects. uteri of pregnant sd rats (pregnancy day 21, 200-380
g in body weight) were isolated and longitudinal uterine
muscle strips of approximately 15 mm in length and 5 mm in
width were prepared. the experiment was performed according to the magnus method. the preparations were exposed to
locke-ringer solution maintained at 37 °c and continuously
gassed with a mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide
under 0.5 g of tension. spontaneous contractions of myometrium were measured isometrically with a force-displacement transducer (sb-1t; nihon-kohdan) and recorded on a
rectigram (rectigraph 8k; nec san-ei). the drug was added
cumulatively to the organ bath every 5 min. the drug efficacy
was evaluated as the molar concentration of the drug required
to produce 50% of the inhibition of uterine contraction as
comparing the total degree of uterine contraction during 5 min
before the addition of the drug (100%) with the total degree of
uterine contraction during 5 min after the addition of the drug
at various concentrations.
bladder pressure in anesthetized rats. male rats
(300-350 g in body weight) were anesthetized with urethane
(1.5 g kg-1, sc), and the midline abdomen was incised. the
ureter on each side was ligated and cut proximal to the ligature
so as to allow urine to drain into cotton wads. after the urethra
had been ligated, a polyethylene catheter (pe-50; nihon becton
dickinson, tokyo, japan) was inserted into the urinary bladder
via the top of the bladder dome and connected through a threeway connector to a pressure transducer (spb-108; nec sanei) and syringe filled with warmed saline. the initial bladder
pressure was adjusted to 6 cm h2o by instillation of warmed
saline (37 °c) in 0.05 ml increments. an arterial catheter was
inserted into the left carotid artery (pe-90; nihon becton
dickinson) and connected to a pressure transducer (spb-108;
nec san-ei) for the measurement of blood pressure. heart
rate was measured via tachometer (132l; nec san-ei) connected to the transducer amplifier (1829; nec san-ei). bladder
pressure, blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded continuously on a rectigraph (recti-horiz-8k; nec san-ei). drug
effects on bladder pressure, blood pressure, and heart rate
were quantified by expressing each post-administration value
as a percentage of the value before drug administration. no
animal was exposed to more than one of the test drugs. a
venous catheter was inserted into the left femoral vein (pe50; nihon becton dickinson) for drug injection.
