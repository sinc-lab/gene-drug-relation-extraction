● hyperhomocysteinemia, a well-recognized cardiovascular risk factor, is frequent in hemodialysis (hd) patients. a
common polymorphism in the 5,10- xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ) gene, c3t substitution at nucleotide
677, is associated with homocysteine (hcy) level elevation. we examined whether three factors involved in the
methionine cycle could inﬂuence plasma hcy concentrations in hd patients:  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism; vitamin b12, an
essential cofactor; and folate, the substrate. in a cross-sectional study, serum vitamin b12, folate, and plasma hcy were
measured and  xxxg1475xxx  genotyping was performed in 534 hd patients. effects of  xxxg1475xxx  genotypes, vitamin b12, and
folate on plasma hcy levels were examined in 450 hd patients not administered vitamin b12 or folate. to examine the
effect of vitamin b12 on plasma hcy concentrations, we compared plasma hcy concentrations in hd patients with and
without vitamin b12 supplementation. to examine whether functional vitamin b12 deﬁciency exists even in hd patients
with normal vitamin b12 concentrations, 15 hd patients (serum vitamin b12 concentrations, 250 to 2,100 pg/ml) were
treated with vitamin b12 ( xxxd1771xxx , 1.5 mg/d) for 8 weeks. serum concentrations of methylmalonic acid (mma) and
vitamin b12 were measured. hcy levels were higher and folate levels were lower in patients with the tt and ct genotypes
compared with patients with the cc genotype. analysis of covariance to determine independent predictors of high hcy
levels identiﬁed low serum vitamin b12 and folate levels and high albumin (alb) levels in cc-genotype patients, low folate
levels and high alb levels in ct-genotype patients, and low folate levels in tt-genotype patients. plasma hcy levels were
lower in cc- and ct-genotype patients with vitamin b12 supplementation than in those without supplementation. vitamin
b12 supplementation for 8 weeks signiﬁcantly reduced mma concentrations in hd patients with normal serum vitamin b12
concentrations. these results indicate that  xxxg1475xxx  genotype inﬂuences the correlation of hcy level with vitamin b12 and folate
levels in hd patients. functional vitamin b12 deﬁciency may exist, even in hd patients with normal vitamin b12 concentrations.
the efﬁcacy of vitamin b12 and folate supplementation on plasma hcy levels may depend on  xxxg1475xxx  genotype.

tients, plasma homocysteine (hcy) concentrations are signiﬁcantly elevated.6-10 generally, the
death rate from cardiovascular diseases is approximately 40% in hd patients.11 thus, effective new treatments to reduce plasma hcy levels,
especially in high-risk hd patients, are eagerly
expected. folate supplementation has been shown
to reduce plasma hcy concentrations in hd
patients,12-15 but for unclear reasons, normalization of plasma hcy level was achieved only in a
small proportion of patients. high doses of folate
(30 and 60 mg/d) have no greater beneﬁcial
effects on plasma hcy levels in hd patients than
the dose of 15 mg/d.16
hyperhomocysteinemia in hd patients has
been ascribed to metabolic impairment, rather
than diminished excretion of this amino acid.17,18
hcy is the transmethylation product of the essential sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine.19
hcy can be either remethylated to methionine or
degraded through the transsulfuration pathway.
in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd),
decreased remethylation results in hyperhomocys-

teinemia.20 two different remethylation pathways exist. the ﬁrst requires reduced cobalamin
levels as a cofactor and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(5-mthf) as a methyl donor produced by a
reaction catalyzed by 5,10- xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ). some individuals
have a common thermolabile variant of  xxxg1475xxx 
with reduced activity that results from a c3t
point mutation at nucleotide position 677
(c677t).21 in the other remethylation pathway,
betaine serves as a methyl donor.
in a general population, most persons with
hyperhomocysteinemia (hcy ⱖ 40 ␮mol/l [5.4
␮g/mu]) have the c677t mutation combined
with low folate stores.22 furthermore, a strong
correlation between plasma folate and hcy levels
is evident only in subjects with the tt genotype.
fodinger et al23 has shown that hyperhomocysteinemia in hd patients is the result of uremia,
folate status, and  xxxg1475xxx  genotype, but not
vitamin b12 status. all healthy hyperhomocysteinemic subjects with the cc genotype have
low vitamin b12 concentrations; vitamin b12
supplementation normalizes plasma hcy concentrations.22 in hd patients with normal serum
vitamin b12 concentrations, vitamin b12 supplementation nonetheless reduced serum methylmalonic acid (mma) concentrations, suggesting
existence of vitamin b12 deﬁciency in terms of
metabolic function in these patients.24 therefore,
hyperhomocysteinemia in hd patients with the
cc genotype might be associated with functional
vitamin b12 deﬁciency.
to examine these possibilities, we measured
plasma hcy and serum vitamin b12 and folate in
serum in 534 hd patients. we also assessed

found that  xxxg1475xxx  genotype inﬂuences the correlation of plasma hcy concentration with serum
folate and serum vitamin b12 levels.
methods

subjects
five hundred thirty-four japanese patients with esrd
treated at ﬁve hd units were investigated. of the 534
patients, 84 patients were administered supplements of vitamins, folate, and/or vitamin b12 (65 patients, vitamin b12; 13
patients, folate; 6 patients, both). characteristics of hd
patients are listed in table 1. in 534 hd patients, serum
concentrations of vitamin b12 and folate and plasma concentrations of hcy were measured and  xxxg1475xxx  genotyping was
performed. effects of  xxxg1475xxx  genotype and serum vitamin
b12 and folate concentrations on plasma hcy concentrations
were examined in 450 hd patients who were not administered vitamin b12 or folate. to clarify the effect of vitamin
b12 supplementation on plasma hcy concentrations, we
compared plasma hcy concentrations in patients without
supplementation with those in patients with vitamin b12
supplementation who had been excluded from the analysis.
finally, to examine whether functional vitamin b12 deﬁciency is common in hd patients, we randomly recruited 15
hd patients with normal serum vitamin b12 concentrations
(serum vitamin b12 ⬎ 250 pg/ml) with permission to
participate on this study.
in this study, all patients were supplemented with vitamin
b12 ( xxxd1771xxx , 1.5 mg/d) for 8 weeks. after 8 weeks,
vitamin b12 supplementation was continued in 7 patients and
stopped in the remaining 8 patients. serum mma and
vitamin b12 concentrations were measured at 0, 8, and 16
weeks after the beginning of the study. dialysis treatment
was quantitated as kt/v, calculated using an equation proposed by daugirdas.25
the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the yamanashi medical university (yamanashi, japan). the nature, purpose, and potential risks of the study
were carefully explained to all subjects before they agreed to

biochemical assays
after fasting, blood was collected before hd therapy,
immediately placed on ice, and centrifuged at 2,000g at 4°c
for 20 minutes within 60 minutes of drawing. supernatants
were stored at ⫺70°c until use. total plasma hcy concentrations were determined by automated high-performance liquid chromatography according to a method originally described by araki and sako.26 brieﬂy, high-performance
liquid chromatography was performed using a hitachi system (l-6000a pump, f-1050 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer, 655a-52 column oven, 655a-40 automated sampler,
and d-2500 chromato-integrator; hitachi high-technologies corp, tokyo, japan). serum folate and vitamin b12
concentrations were measured by means of an automated
chemiluminescent assay system (advia; centaur; bayer,
tarrytown, ny), using a commercially available kit for
folate and vitamin b12 assays (bayer). serum mma was
measured by a stable-isotope dilution technique using solidphase sample extraction and gas chromatography using a
mass spectrometer in the selected ion-monitoring mode.27

genotyping of  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism
the c3t polymorphism at position 677 in the  xxxg1475xxx 
gene was identiﬁed as previously described.21

statistical analyses
in the cross-sectional study, we performed the analysis
among three genotypes of  xxxg1475xxx  (cc, ct, and tt).
homogeneity of each background factor among genotypes
was tested using one-way analysis of variance and chisquare test. for analysis of correlation among parameters,
we performed pearson’s correlation analysis. to clarify
apparent interactions in hd patients between  xxxg1475xxx  genotypes and logarithmically transformed folate or vitamin b12
concentrations (natural logarithms: ln[folate] or ln[b12])
with respect to ln(hcy), we used the following general linear
model (model 1), which contains ln(hcy) as a dependent

the relationship of ln(hcy) to ln(folate) and ln(b12),
considering effects of alb and kt/v in each  xxxg1475xxx  genotype, was assessed by analysis of covariance using the

to evaluate the effect of elevated serum vitamin b12

to compare plasma hcy, serum vitamin b12, and serum folate
levels in patients without vitamin b12 supplementation with
those in patients with vitamin b12 supplementation who had
been excluded from the analyses. finally, in 15 hd patients
with serum vitamin b12 concentrations within the normal

signiﬁcant changes in serum concentrations of vitamin b12
and mma at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after the beginning of this
study.

mean hcy concentrations in patients with the
tt and ct genotypes were signiﬁcantly greater
than in cc-genotype patients (table 2). serum

statistical analysis using a general linear model
(model 1) to examine for interaction between
 xxxg1475xxx  genotype and ln(folate) or ln(b12) with
respect to ln(hcy) indicated that  xxxg1475xxx  genotype inﬂuences the correlation of ln(hcy) with
ln(folate) and ln(b12) (table 3). we therefore
analyzed the relationship of ln(hcy) to ln(folate)
and ln(b12) for each  xxxg1475xxx  genotype. as listed
in table 4, low ln(b12) was a strong determinant
of increased plasma hcy levels in patients with
the cc genotype. low ln(folate) and high alb
levels also were independent determinants of
high plasma hcy levels. in patients with the ct
genotype, low ln(folate), high alb, and low kt/v
values were independent determinants of high
plasma hcy levels, whereas low ln(b12) was not
(table 4). for tt-genotype patients, low ln(folate) was an independent determinant of elevated
plasma hcy concentration.

differences in hcy, vitamin b12, and folate
levels between patients with and without
vitamin b12 supplementation
as listed in table 5, plasma hcy concentrations were higher in patients with the cc and ct
genotypes without vitamin b12 supplementation
than those with vitamin b12 supplementation. a
tendency toward this relationship observed in
tt-genotype patients was short of statistical signiﬁcance. although serum vitamin b12 concentrations were higher in patients with than without

groups.

in 15 hd patients with normal serum vitamin

for 8 weeks signiﬁcantly reduced mma concentrations, whereas vitamin b12 levels were signiﬁcantly increased (fig 1). additional 8-week vitamin b12 supplementation further reduced mma
concentrations and increased serum vitamin b12
concentrations compared with levels before and
8 weeks after the beginning of treatment. conversely, discontinued supplementation in 8 patients increased mma and decreased vitamin b12
concentrations to initial levels before supplementation (fig 1).

discussion

the present study shows that hd patients with
the tt and ct genotypes of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene
have signiﬁcantly greater hcy and lower serum
folate concentrations than those with the cc
genotype. no differences in other parameters,
including serum vitamin b12 concentrations, were
found among the three genotypes. analysis of
covariance to determine independent predictors
of high hcy levels identiﬁed low serum concen-

trations of vitamin b12 and folate and high alb
concentrations in cc-genotype patients; low folate levels, high alb levels, and low kt/v in
ct-genotype patients; and low folate levels in
tt-genotype patients. plasma hcy concentrations were greater in patients with the cc and ct
genotypes without vitamin b12 supplementation
than those with vitamin b12 supplementation. in
hd patients with serum vitamin b12 concentrations within normal range, vitamin b12 supple-

mentation for 8 weeks signiﬁcantly reduced
mma concentrations. additional 8-week supplementation further reduced mma concentrations,
whereas concentrations returned to the initial
level with discontinuation.
the pathogenesis of hcy level elevation in
renal failure is only partially understood. approximately 30% of hcy present in plasma is free
form, rather than protein bound, and therefore
can pass freely through the glomerular basement
membrane. its ﬁltration rate is approximately
550 ␮mol/d (74.4 mg/d).28,29 however, more
than 99.5% of hcy is reabsorbed from ultraﬁltrate by renal tubules and is suggested to convert
to metabolites through the transsulfuration pathway.30,31 alternatively, remethylation may occur
by either the enzyme betaine-hcy methyltransferase32 or 5-mthf–hcy methyltransferase.33
recently, van guldener et al20 showed that conversion of hcy to methionine, but not transsulfuration of hcy, is substantially decreased in hd
patients and concluded that decreased hcy remethylation could explain hyperhomocysteinemia
in hd patients.
the enzyme  xxxg1475xxx  represents an important
participant in the hcy remethylation pathway.
decreased  xxxg1475xxx  activity results in inadequate
production of 5-mthf, which is required for
remethylation of hcy to methionine; plasma hcy
concentrations become elevated as a consequence of insufﬁcient remethylation.34,35 tt and
ct genotypes result in a thermolabile  xxxg1475xxx 
phenotype.21 absolute enzyme activity of
 xxxg1475xxx  is reduced by 50% in homozygotes
(tt) and 25% in heterozygotes (ct).21 recently,
the tt genotype was associated with elevated
plasma hcy concentrations in patients with esrd
treated with hd or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis23,36; this ﬁnding is in accordance
with our results. in addition, we conﬁrmed that
the correlation between plasma hcy and serum
folate levels was stronger in patients with the tt
or ct genotype, in agreement with kimura et
al.37
vitamin b12 in plasma is bound by  xxxg2255xxx 
and transcobalamin ii (tc ii). the tc ii-b12
complex is transported to the cytosol of cells
through its receptor and reduced to hydroxo-b12.
hydroxo-b12 bound to methyltransferase is converted to methyl-b12 during the conversion of
5-mthf to tetrahydrofolate. finally, hcy is con-

1037

verted to methionine in the presence of methylb12 bound to methyltransferase.38 hydroxo-b12
also is transported to mitochondria, where it is
converted to deoxyadenosyl-b12, which serves as
a coenzyme for  xxxg1485xxx .39 a diagnostic deﬁnition of functional vitamin b12 deﬁciency as increased plasma mma
concentration that decreases on injection of vitamin b12 has been reported.40 in hd patients with
and without apparent vitamin b12 deﬁciency,
vitamin b12 supplementation decreased serum
mma concentrations.24,38 the present study
shows that vitamin b12 supplementation reduced
serum mma concentrations, even in hd patients
with normal-range serum vitamin b12 concentrations (⬎250 pg/ml), and additional supplementation further reduced serum vitamin b12 concentrations, whereas concentrations were increased
to initial levels before supplementation with discontinuation. this result suggests the existence
of functional vitamin b12 deﬁciency. therefore,
transport of vitamin b12 into the cytosol of cells,
intracellular conversion of vitamin b12 to hydroxo-b12, or both may be impaired in uremia.
guttormsen et al22 found that all healthy hyperhomocysteinemic subjects with the cc genotype
have low vitamin b12 concentrations, and vitamin b12 supplementation alone has normalized
their plasma hcy concentrations. analysis of
covariance showed low vitamin b12 concentrations to be a signiﬁcant independent predictor of
elevated plasma hcy levels only in cc-genotype
patients. patients with the cc genotype with
vitamin b12 supplementation had lower plasma
hcy concentrations than those without supplementation. in patients without supplementation,
only one subject had serum vitamin b12 concentrations less than normal range, suggesting that
hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with the cc
genotype may result at least in part from functional vitamin b12 deﬁciency. in addition, low
folate and high alb concentrations in plasma
were signiﬁcant independent predictors in ccgenotype patients. these additional factors also
may contribute to elevated plasma hcy concentrations in patients with the cc genotype.
analysis of covariance failed to identify low
serum vitamin b12 concentrations as an independent predictor of high plasma hcy levels in
patients with the ct and tt genotypes, although
vitamin b12 concentrations were similar among

nakamura et al

all three genotypes. serum folate concentrations
were lower in patients with the ct and tt
genotypes than those with the cc genotype,
shown in non-hd subjects41 and hd patients.35
these low folate concentrations are likely to
result from reduced production of 5-mthf, a
product of  xxxg1475xxx . because hydroxo-b12 is
converted to methyl-b12 by transfer of the methyl
moiety from 5-mthf, low 5-mthf concentrations in the cytosol might conceal a deﬁciency of
hydroxo-b12 in patients with the ct and tt
genotypes. in addition, vitamin b12 supplementation signiﬁcantly reduced plasma hcy levels in
ct-genotype patients and had a slight, but similar, effect in tt-genotype patients that was short
of signiﬁcance. these ﬁndings suggest that folate
supplementation may unmask a relative vitamin
b12 deﬁciency.
in conclusion, we show a strong negative
correlation between plasma hcy and serum vitamin b12 levels in patients with the cc genotype,
but not patients with the ct and tt genotypes.
vitamin b12 supplementation signiﬁcantly reduced serum mma levels, even in hd patients
with normal serum vitamin b12 concentrations.
these ﬁndings show a functional vitamin b12
deﬁciency in hd patients without b12 supplementation and implicate this relative imbalance in
hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with the cc
and ct genotypes. therefore, the efﬁcacy of
vitamin b12 and folate supplementation may depend on  xxxg1475xxx  genotype. a prospective interventional study using a treatment algorithm based
on this distinction should be undertaken.
