abstract: novel coxibs (i.e.  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd3481xxx ,  xxxd2849xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx ) with enhanced
biochemical cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 selectivity over that of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been
recently developed. they have the potential advantage to spare cox-1 activity, thus reducing
gastrointestinal toxicity, even when administered at high doses to improve efficacy. they are
characterized by different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics features. the higher
biochemical selectivity of  xxxd3481xxx  than celecoxib, evidenced in vitro, may be clinically
relevant leading to an improved gastrointestinal safety. interestingly,  xxxd2849xxx , a pro-drug of
 xxxd3481xxx , is the only injectable coxib.  xxxd2069xxx  shows only a slightly improved cox-2 selectivity than rofecoxib, a
highly selective cox-2 inhibitor that has been reported to halve the incidence of serious gastrointestinal toxicity
compared to nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids).  xxxd2517xxx , the most selective cox-2
inhibitor in vitro, is the only acidic coxib. the hypothesis that this chemical property may lead to an increased and
persistent drug accumulation in inflammatory sites and consequently to an improved clinical efficacy, however, remains
to be verified. several randomized clinical studies suggest that the novel coxibs have comparable efficacy to nonselective
nsaids in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain, but they share similar renal side-effects.
the apparent dose-dependence of renal toxicity may limit the use of higher doses of the novel coxibs for improved
efficacy. large-size randomized clinical trials are ongoing to define the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of the
novel coxibs.

mechanism of action of nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids)
aspirin and related nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(nsaids) are a heterogeneous group of compounds that
share therapeutic-effects (antipyretic, analgesic, and
antiinflammatory actions) and unwanted side-effects
[primarily gastrointestinal (gi) and renal toxicity], largely
dependent on the inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis [1-3].
prostanoids are ubiquitous lipid mediators that coordinate
a wide variety of physiologic and pathologic processes
through the interaction with specific cell-membrane
receptors that belong to the g-protein-coupled rhodopsintype family [4] (fig. (1)). under physiologic conditions,
prostanoids play an important role in the cytoprotection of
the gastric mucosa, hemostasis and renal hemodynamics.
the biosynthesis of prostanoids is induced in pathologic
condition, such as inflammation and cancer [2, 3, 5-7]. the
enzyme cyclooxygenase (cox) catalizes the rate-limiting
step in the formation of prostanoids from  xxxd208xxx 
(aa) [7-11] (fig. (1)). two isoforms of the cox enzyme
have been cloned and characterized: cox-1 and cox-2
[12]. the expression of the two cox isozymes is differently
regulated [6-8]. cox-1 displays the characteristics of a

“housekeeping gene” and is constitutively expressed in
virtually all tissues. it is mainly utilized in the immediate
biosynthesis of prostanoids, which occurs within several
minutes after stimulation with ca2+ mobilizers [4].
differently, the inducible cox-2 is an absolute requirement
for delayed prostanoid biosynthesis, which lasts for several
hours following proinflammatory stimuli [4]. however, this
simplified paradigm of constitutive cox-1 and inducible
cox-2 has many exceptions: cox-1 can be regulated
during development [7, 13], whereas cox-2 is constitutively
expressed in the brain [14], reproductive tissues [15] and
kidney [16-18].
the two cox-isozymes are membrane-anchored proteins
with remarkable structural similarity. the substrate, aa,
gains access to the active site via a hydrophobic channel
(cox channel) and nsaids block the biosynthesis of
prostanoids as they occupy the cox channel of cox-1 and
cox-2 [19-21]. cox-2, but not cox-1, is characterized by
an accessible side pocket that is an extension to the
hydrophobic channel [20, 21].
the inhibition of cox-2 is thought to mediate the
therapeutic actions of nsaids, while the inhibition of cox1 results in unwanted side-effects, particularly at the gi tract
[1-3] (fig. (2)). in fact, cox-1 is the major cox isoform
expressed in platelets and gastric mucosa of normal humans
[22, 23]. nsaids toxicity in the gi mucosa leading to
ulceration, bleeding, perforation and obstruction, is the result
of inhibition of cox-1 activity in platelets, that increases the
tendency of bleeding, and in gastric mucosa, where

fig. (1). pathway of prostanoid biosynthesis and their specific receptors. arachidonc acid (aa), a 20-carbon fatty acid containing four
double bonds, is released from the sn2 position in membrane phospholipids by phospholipases and is metabolized enzymatically into the
prostanoids, i.e. prostaglandin(pg) xxxd2037xxx , pgf 2alpha, pgd 2, prostacyclin (pgi 2) and thromboxane(tx)a 2. the coordinate activity of 3 consecutive
enzymatic steps are involved in prostanoid biosynthesis: 1) the release of aa from membrane phospholipids carried out by phospholipase
a2, 2) the transformation of aa to the unstable endoperoxide pgh 2 by pgh-synthases (cox-1 and cox-2), and 3) its metabolization to the
different prostanoids by isomerases which have different structures and exhibit a cell- and tissue-specific distribution. the different
prostanoids activate specific cell-membrane receptors that belong to the g-protein-coupled rhodopsin-type family.

prostanoids play an important role in protecting the stomach
from erosion and ulceration [1-3].
development of selective cox-2 inhibitors
the discovery of cox-2 [12, 21, 24] has provided the
rationale for the development of a new class of nsaids, the

selective cox-2 inhibitors (denominated coxibs), with the
aim of reducing the gi toxicity associated with the
administration of nonselective nsaids, by virtue of cox-1
sparing [1- 3] (fig. (2)).
rofecoxib and celecoxib are the first selective cox-2
inhibitors approved by fda and emea for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis (ra), osteoarthritis (oa) and for relief

of acute pain associated with dental surgery and primary
dysmenorrhea. they are diaryleterocyclic derivatives
containing a phenylsulphone and a phenylsulphonamide
moiety, respectively (fig. (3)) that interact with cox-2 sidepocket, through slow, tight-binding kinetics [25]. this
interaction represents an important determinant for cox-2
selectivity, however, the two drugs display different cox1/cox-2 ic 50 ratios in the whole blood assays in vitro [26,
27], i.e. 272 and 30, respectively [28]. the cox-1/cox-2
ic50 ratio of rofecoxib detected in vitro translates into a
specific inhibition of cox-2 when the drug is administered
at therapeutic doses and above [29, 30]. in fact, rofecoxib
almost completely inhibits monocyte cox-2 activity without
affecting cox-1 activity up to 1000 mg [29], that is 80-fold
higher than the initial dose recommended for clinical use in
oa [2]. moreover, 50 mg, that is 2-fold higher than the
therapeutic dose of the drug in ra, does not affect gastric
prostaglandin (pg)e2 biosynthesis ex vivo [30]. thus,
rofecoxib represents an appropriate tool to test the
hypothesis that the antiinflammatory and analgesic effects of
nsaids are dependent on the inhibition of cox-2, while
their typical side-effects are due to the inhibition of cox-1.
a large randomized, double-blind gi outcomes study has
been performed to assess the risk of clinically important
upper gi (ugi) events associated with rofecoxib vs the

nonselective nsaid naproxen: the vioxx gastointestinal
outcomes research (vigor) study [31]. rofecoxib and
naproxen showed similar efficacy against ra, and the
incidence of gi perforation, gi haemorrhage, or
symptomatic peptic ulcer was significantly (p<0.001) lower
in patients with ra treated with rofecoxib vs naproxen [31].
the concurrence of biochemical and clinical selectivity of
rofecoxib strongly support a cytoprotective role of cox-1.
in contrast, detectable inhibition of cox-1 by celecoxib at
800 mg daily [32] (that is 2-fold higher than the maximal
chronic dose recommended in oa) may have contributed, at
least in part, to its failure in reducing significantly the
incidence of ulcer perforation, gastric-outlet obstraction or
ugi bleeding vs ibuprofen or diclofenac in the celecoxib
long-term arthritis safety study (class) [33, 34]. the
class trial was a combined analysis of two separate
studies: in one celecoxib was compared with diclofenac, a
drug with a similar cox-2 selectivity to celecoxib (cox1/cox-2 ic50 ratio: 29 vs 30, respectively), in the other
study celecoxib was compared with ibuprofen (cox1/cox-2 ic 50 ratio: 0.5). the different cox-2 selectivity of
the two comparators may have contributed to the apparent
heterogeneity of the results found in the two studies, i.e.
celecoxib was comparable to diclofenac while it was
superior to ibuprofen [2, 28].

a new wave of coxibs
novel cox-2 inhibitors with improved biochemical
selectivity over that of commercially available coxibs, have
been recently developed, i.e.  xxxd2069xxx  [35],  xxxd3481xxx 
[36],  xxxd2849xxx  [37] and  xxxd2517xxx  [38] (fig. (3) and table
1).  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd3481xxx  and  xxxd2849xxx  contain a cysstilbene moiety with a 4-methylsulphonil or sulphonamide
substituent, while  xxxd2517xxx  is a phenyl acetic acid
derivative of diclofenac. thus, differently from the other
coxibs,  xxxd2517xxx  is an acidic compound. it has been
suggested that this chemical feature might lead to an
increased and persistent drug concentrations in inflamed
tissues [39] and therefore to an improved clinical efficacy.
however, this hypothesis remains to be verified.

some coxibs (table 1) [41, 42], with slower drug metabolism
could be responsible for detectable inhibition of platelet
cox-1 after the administration of a therapeutic coxib dose.
it has been recently shown that cyp2c9*3 allelic variant of
cyp2c9 (whose frequency ranges 3-8.5% in caucasians) is
associated with markedly slower metabolism of celecoxib
[43]. studies are ongoing to verify whether the expression of
variant forms of cox-1 with enhanced sensitivity to coxibs
may be involved in their detected pharmacodynamic
variability. thus, theoretically, a highly selective cox-2
inhibitor has the advantage to spare cox-1 even in subjects
with slower drug metabolism and/or enhanced enzyme
sensitivity. another advantage of the development of cox-2
inhibitors with improved biochemical selectivity over that of
commercially available coxibs could be that of using higher
coxib doses for improved efficacy. several studies suggest
that the second generation of cox-2 inhibitors is efficacious
as nonselective nsaids in the treatment of oa, ra and
acute pain [38, 44-47]. only one clinical study by
matsumoto et al. showed that  xxxd2069xxx  is more efficacious
than naproxen in the treatment of ra [48]. however, it
should be pointed out that these trials were designed to
detect equivalence of efficacy between coxibs and nsaids,
but not difference between the treatments. moreover, the
clinical end-points used in these trials are largely inadequate
to detect small differences in efficacy that might reflect the
participation of cox-1-derived prostanoids in inflammation
[49]. however, an important limitation to the use of higher
coxib doses for improved efficacy could be the dosedependence of mechanism-based renal effects associated
with these agents [50].

the improved biochemical cox-1/cox-2 selectivity of
the novel cox-2 inhibitors (table 1) should translate into a
lower proportion of exposed patients to a clinically
meaningful inhibition of cox-1 activity in the presence of a
profound suppression of cox-2 [2, 3]. this may lead to
cox-1 sparing even in patients characterized by an
enhanced biochemical response to the drug. in fact,
intersubject variability in the inhibition of platelet cox-1
and monocyte cox-2 ex vivo by cox inhibitors has been
detected and it has been proposed to involve both
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic variability [32, 40].
thus, the expression of variant forms of the cytochrome
p450 2c9 (cyp2c9), the major pathway of metabolism of

 xxxd3481xxx  inhibited platelet cox-1 and monocyte
cox-2 activities with ic50 values of 40±3.90 µm
(mean±sem) and 0.65±0.06 µm, respectively (cox1/cox-2 ic50 ratio: 61.50±8.30), that are 2.5-fold higher
(p<0.01) and similar (p=0.299) to that of celecoxib (16±12.5
and 0.54±0.07µm, respectively) [28]. the 2-fold higher
cox-1/cox-2 selectivity of  xxxd3481xxx  vs celecoxib
demonstrated in vitro may be adequate to reduce the chance
of a patient to have detectable cox-1 inhibition at
therapeutic plasma levels as compared with the parent
compound. it has been reported that, at steady-state,
 xxxd3481xxx  (40 mg b.i.d., a 8-fold higher dose than that
recommended in oa) administered to healthy adult [51] and
healthy elderly volunteers [52] did not affect platelet
aggregation, bleeding time or serum txb2 production, an
index of platelet cox-1 activity.
 xxxd2849xxx  is the water-soluble inactive prodrug of
 xxxd3481xxx  [37]. it is rapidly converted by hepatic enzymatic
hydrolysis to the active cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd3481xxx , thus
sharing the same pharmacodynamic properties [37].
in the human whole blood assays,  xxxd2069xxx  showed a
cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratio of 344±48 [28]. in particular,
 xxxd2069xxx  reduces platelet cox-1 and monocyte cox-2
activities with ic50 values of 162±12 (mean±sem) and

0.47±0.06 µm, that are 2.6- and 3.3-fold higher than those of
rofecoxib (49±6 and 0.18±0.03 µm, respectively, cox1/cox-2 ic50 ratio: 272±35) [28]. dallob et al. [53] have
reported that the administration of  xxxd2069xxx , as single doses
(5-500 mg) to healthy subjects, was associated with a doseand time- dependent inhibition of whole blood cox-2
activity ex vivo without significantly affecting platelet cox1 activity. at steady state,  xxxd2069xxx  caused a dosedependent inhibition of monocyte cox-2, but not platelet
cox-1 [53]. at 4 hr after the last administration of 100 and
150 mg, monocyte cox-2 activity was reduced by 82 and
93%, respectively, and then recovered slowly. in fact, a
profound inhibition was still present at 24 hr, i.e. 60 and

80%, respectively. these results support a once-daily dosing
regimen of  xxxd2069xxx . the effects of  xxxd2069xxx  (120 mg
once daily) and naproxen (500 mg b.i.d.), administered for 4
consecutive days, on pge2 synthesis in gastric biopsies of
healthy subjects, presumably cox-1-dependent, was studied
[53]. naproxen, but not  xxxd2069xxx , significantly inhibited
gastric pge2 synthesis.
 xxxd2517xxx  is a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor in
vitro. in fact, using the whole blood assays, we have found a
cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratio of 400 (unpublished results). the
available data on the clinical pharmacology of  xxxd2517xxx 
are only published in abstract form and have been recently
reviewed [38]. it has been reported that at the antiinflam-

594

matory dose of 200 mg b.i.d. administered for a week, and at
a single dose of 800 mg,  xxxd2517xxx  did not affect platelet
aggregation and cox-1 activity ex vivo [38].
pharmacokinetics
the novel coxibs display different pharmacokinetic
characteristics that are reported in table 1.  xxxd2069xxx  has
the longest half-life, supporting a once-daily dosing regimen.
in contrast,  xxxd2517xxx  has a short half-life (3-6 hr), but its
long-lasting clinical efficacy has suggested a once-daily
dosing regimen [38].
differently from rofecoxib, that is extensively metabolized by the liver via reductive pathways, the other coxibs are
metabolized by cyp 3a4 and 2c9 enzymes [44-47, 54-58].
the cyp reaction phenotype of  xxxd2069xxx  (of which the
cyp3a4 seems to account for the majority of the activity)
differs from that of other cox inhibitors, such as celecoxib,
 xxxd3481xxx ,  xxxd2561xxx , ibuprofen,  xxxd2141xxx  and indomethacin, that are primarily (≥80%) metabolized by cyp2c9
[41, 42].
 xxxd2849xxx , the prodrug of  xxxd3481xxx , is the first injectable cox-2 inhibitor. following intravenous (i.v.) administration in healthy volunteers,  xxxd2849xxx  sodium (50 mg every
12 hr), was rapidly converted to  xxxd3481xxx  (elimination t1/2:
0.69 hr) with peak plasma levels reached 30 min after dosing
[59].
interactions with other drugs
the potential interactions of novel coxibs with other
drugs, that might be utilized concomitantly in the intended
target population and that might have clinical consequences
if their pharmacokinetics were substantively altered, have
been studied, but most of the results have not been published
yet. the administration of selective cox-2 inhibitors with
drugs that are known to inhibit cyp3a4 and cyp2c9 (e.g.
fluconazole and ketoconazole) can result in their increased
plasma concentrations [54-58]. the pharmacokinetics of
warfarin are altered by  xxxd3481xxx  and  xxxd2069xxx  leading to
slightly increased anticoagulant effects. as nsaid treatment
may potentially increase the nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporin or tacrolimus and lithium plasma levels, renal function
and blood lithium should be monitored when coxibs and
either of these drugs are used in combination. no relevant
interactions with methotrexate, propofol,  xxxd2215xxx  or
midazolam have been observed following the administration
of  xxxd3481xxx  [54-57]. in contrast,  xxxd2069xxx  induced no
changes in the plasma pharmacokinetics of prednisone/
prednisolone [45, 46], ketoconazole and antiacids, while it
may influence the plasma pharmacokinetics of oral
contraceptives, digoxin, methotrexate and oral anticoagulants. moreover, similarly to nonselective nsaids and
selective cox-2 inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib),
 xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd3481xxx  may cause a slight attenuation of
the effects of several classes of antihypertensive drugs,
including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and
furosemide.
 xxxd2849xxx  shows the same drug-interactions of its
metabolite,  xxxd3481xxx  [55-57, 59, 60]. about  xxxd2517xxx ,
no information are available.

tacconelli et al.

clinical efficacy
the results of clinical trials demonstrate that the novel
coxibs have similar clinical efficacy compared with
nonselective nsaids and that they are superior to placebo in
the treatment of oa, ra and acute pain (i.e. primary
dysmenorrhea and post-operative dental pain) (tables 2-5)
[48, 61-81]. differently from other coxibs,  xxxd2069xxx  has
been approved also for the treatment of chronic low-back
pain and acute gouty arthritis [77, 78].
the use of cox inhibitors in preemptive analgesia has
been suggested to induce a better control of post-surgical
pain, thus reducing the opioid use. in this regard, coxibs, that
do not alter hemostasis, offer an important advantage over
the nonselective nsaids [82]. recently, it has been shown
that the use of single dose of rofecoxib or celecoxib before
orthopedic surgery reduced both post-operative pain and
post-surgical morphine use. similarly, desjardins et al. have
shown the efficacy of  xxxd2849xxx  before oral surgery [73].
safety and tolerability of novel coxibs
the gi safety data of the novel coxibs have been
extrapolated from clinical efficacy trials. data on long-term
(up to 12 weeks) administration of  xxxd3481xxx  at doses of 540 mg, pooled from 3 multi-center studies with a total of
1480 patients with oa of the hip and knee and with ra,
confirm that the drug is safe when used in chronic treatment
[61-69]. the most common adverse effects were gi
symptoms (i.e. abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and
nausea), headache and infection of the upper respiratory tract
that however have an incidence of only ~5% during the 12week treatment period. the incidence of gastroduodenal
ulcers evaluated in the study of sikes et al. [83] was
comparable in patients receiving  xxxd3481xxx  10 or 20 mg, or
placebo over 12-weeks, and was significantly higher in
patients receiving ibuprofen and diclofenac (p<0.05 vs
placebo). a minority of patients in each treatment group (918%) received concomitant low-dose aspirin (<325 mg/day)
during the trial. users of low-dose aspirin receiving
 xxxd3481xxx  10 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily or
diclofenac 150 mg daily were at significantly higher risk of
developing gastroduodenal ulcers than patients not taking
low-dose aspirin. despite the higher overall incidence of
gastroduodenal ulcers in patients taking low-dose aspirin,
compared with non-users, patients taking  xxxd3481xxx  10 mg
or 20 mg once daily with low-dose aspirin had a significantly
lower incidence of ulceration compared with patients taking
ibuprofen 2400 mg or diclofenac 150 mg daily, with lowdose aspirin (p<0.014) [83].
the gi safety of  xxxd2849xxx  has been evaluated vs
ketorolac, a nonselective nsaid widely used as a
preoperative analgesic. the incidence of gastroduodenal and
gastric ulcers or erosions was significantly increased in the
group receiving ketorolac as compared to  xxxd2849xxx  sodium
and placebo groups (p<0.05) [84]. however, this study is
limited by the the small sample size (92 patients) and the
short duration of treatment (up to 7 days).
 xxxd2069xxx  was generally well tolerated in the
randomized clinical trials performed to evaluate the clinical
efficacy of the drug in patients with oa, ra, acute dental

pain and chronic low-back pain [48, 74-79]. a prospectively
defined combined analysis of 10 clinical trials of  xxxd2069xxx 
(3142 patients) suggests that  xxxd2069xxx  halves both
investigator-reported perforations, ulcers and bleeds (pubs)
and confirmed pubs compared with nonselective nsaids
[45, 46]. in addition, the results of another combined
analysis suggests that the treatment with  xxxd2069xxx 
significantly reduced the need for gastroprotective agents
and for gi co-medications by approximately 40% compared
with nonselective nsaids (p<0.001). moreover, the
treatment with nsaids significantly increased the need for
gastroprotective agents and gi co-medication treatment,
compared with placebo (p<0.001), whereas treatment with
 xxxd2069xxx  did not (p=0.22) [45, 46]. it has also been
demonstrated that  xxxd2069xxx  reduced by over 40% the
number of discontinuations due to adverse gi effects [45,
46]. to assess the gi safety of  xxxd2069xxx  vs non selective
nsaids, hunt et al. [85] have performed two randomized,
double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies. daily
faecal red blood cell loss was measured in 62 healthy
subjects receiving  xxxd2069xxx  (120 mg once daily), ibuprofen
(2400 mg daily) or placebo for 28 days, and the incidence of

endoscopically detectable gastric/duodenal ulcers was
determined in 742 oa or ra patients receiving  xxxd2069xxx 
(120 mg once daily), naproxen (500 mg b.i.d) or placebo
over 12 weeks. in the first study, the between-treatment ratio
of faecal blood loss for  xxxd2069xxx  vs placebo (1.06) was not
significantly different from unity while that for ibuprofen vs
placebo (3.26) and  xxxd2069xxx  (3.08) were significantly
greater than unity (p<0.001). in the second study, the
incidence of ulcers of ≥ 3 mm with naproxen (25.3%) was
significantly higher than that with  xxxd2069xxx  (7.4%) or
placebo (1.4%, p<0.001); the results were similar for ulcers
of ≥5 mm.
regarding luminacoxib, only two studies have been
performed to evaluate the gi safety and have been published
as abstracts and reviewed by stichtenoth and frolich [38].
the small bowel toxicity of  xxxd2517xxx  was compared with
that of naproxen or placebo in a randomized, three period,
cross-over, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled
study. twenty-five healthy subjects were randomized to
receive  xxxd2517xxx  800 mg once daily, naproxen 500 mg

periods and  xxxd2517xxx  was not different from placebo in
this setting. in contrast, treatment with naproxen caused a
significant increase in intestinal permeability [38]. in
addition, a long-term study performed in 1042 patients with
oa receiving  xxxd2517xxx  200, 400 mg once daily, celecoxib
200 mg once daily, or ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d for 13 weeks,
has showed that the cumulative incidence rate of
gastroduodenal ulcers was comparable between patients who
received  xxxd2517xxx  and celecoxib, and was significantly
reduced in patients treated with  xxxd2517xxx  and celecoxib,
compared with patients treated with ibuprofen. moreover,
the mean number of gastroduodenal erosions was
significantly higher in the ibuprofen group compared with all
other treatment groups [38]. further studies with  xxxd2517xxx 
are underway. the ongoing target study (therapeutic
arthritis research & gastrointestinal event trial) will
evaluate the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2517xxx  400 mg once
daily compared with ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. and naproxen
500 mg b.i.d. in 18000 patients with oa over 12 months.
this trial will evaluate the incidence of complicated gi
ulcers as primary end-point.
although an improved gi safety profile of the novel
selective cox-2 inhibitors vs nonselective nsaids is
assumed, it should be confirmed by the results of large size
randomized clinical trials with serious ugi events (i.e.
gastroduodenal perforation, obstruction and ugi bleeding)
as primary end-point.
renovascular safety profile
several lines of evidence support a critical role for cox2 in the regulation of renal function. cox-2 is expressed in
critical locations within the kidney (i.e. in the renal
vasculature, in the macula densa associated cells, in the
cortical thick ascending limb and medullary interstitial cells)
[2, 50]. by contrast, cox-1 is localized in the vasculature,
the conducting ducts and the thin loops of henle [2, 50].
recently, qi et al. have demonstrated that cox-2 inhibition
enhances and prolonges the vasopressor effects of

 xxxd2517xxx  50, 100 and 200 mg
b.i.d. were superior to placebo, but
less effective than diclofenac

 xxxg99xxx  (ang ii), while cox-1 inhibition diminishes
the pressory effect of ang ii [86]. these findings support the
contribution of cox-2 rather than cox-1 inhibition to the
development of hypertension, salt retention and edema
associated with nsaid use [86]. moreover, the observation
that in normal salt-replete subjects, celecoxib and rofecoxib,
but not nonselective nsaids, are gfr sparing while the two
coxibs affect sodium excretion similarly to nonselective
nsaids, suggests that the control of gfr may be
predominantly cox-1 mediated, whereas cox-2 modulates
sodium and water balance [87-90]. recently, whelton et al.
compared the renovascular effects of  xxxd457xxx  daily
and rofecoxib 25 mg daily administered for six weeks to
elderly patients with systemic hypertension and oa. they
found that significantly (p<0.01) more patients in the
rofecoxib group (14.9%) compared with the celecoxib group
(6.9%) developed increased systolic blood pressure (change
>20 mm hg plus absolute value >140 mm hg) [91].
clinically significant new-onset or worsening edema
associated with weight gain developed in a greater
percentage of patients in the rofecoxib group (7.7%)
compared with the celecoxib group (4.7%) (p<0.05). these
results may suggest that the renal toxicity of cox inhibitors
is dependent on the extent of cox-1/cox-2 selectivity.
however, this important issue cannot be solved by this study
because the doses of the two drugs were not comparable. in
fact, geba et al. have shown that rofecoxib 25, but not 12.5,
mg daily, administered up to 6 weeks to oa patients, was
clinically superior to  xxxd457xxx  daily [92]. dosedependent hypertensive effects has been reported with
rofecoxib but not with celecoxib, however, this question has
not been examined in appropiate randomized clinical trials.
thus, based on the current data, there are no clinically
significant differences among celecoxib, rofecoxib and
nonselective nsaids in terms of renal effects.
very few information are available on the renal effects of
novel coxibs. a combined analysis of 8 phase iii studies in
oa, ra, chronic low-back pain and surveillance endoscopy
has shown that the risk of lower extremity edema and
hypertension adverse experiences with  xxxd2069xxx  was low
and generally similar to comparator nsaids and there was

598

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 6

no evidence of strong dose-related trends [45, 46]. regarding
renal safety of  xxxd3481xxx , pooled data obtained from oa
and ra trials have demonstrated that the incidence of
common renal adverse effects (albuminuria, peripheral
edema and hypertension) following  xxxd3481xxx  treatment (40
mg) is higher than that of placebo, but does not significantly
exceed that of traditional nsaids [60].
cardiovascular safety profile
prostacyclin is thought to be part of a homeostatic
defence mechanism that limits the consequences of platelet
activation in vivo [93, 94]. prostacyclin biosynthesis is
largely mediated by cox-2, in fact, similarly to nonselective
nsaids, coxibs reduced the urinary excretion of
prostacyclin metabolites in normal subjects [32, 95], but, in
contrast, they did not affect platelet thromboxane (tx) a2
biosynthesis [29, 32]. the cardiovascular implications of
these effects are currently debated, based on the results of the
vigor trial showing a statistically significant difference in
acute myocardial infarction (mi) rates between rofecoxib
and naproxen (0.4 vs. 0.1%, respectively) [31]. three
possible explanations can be proposed [96]: 1) a
cardioprotective effect of naproxen: but, there is both
contradictory and supporting evidence that naproxen reduces
the risk of mi [97-101], 2) a thrombogenic effect of coxibs:
but, the size of the effect is not biologically plausible if due
to incomplete inhibition of a single mediator of
“thromboresistance”, i.e. prostacyclin [32], 3) the play of
chance: the apparent difference in vigor might represent
uneven distribution of a small number of events occurring
over a short time frame in a low-risk population, a
metaanalysis of all coxib trials might address this possibility.
very few information are available on the cardiovascular
effects of cox-2 inhibition by  xxxd2069xxx  that are only
published as abstract. fisher et al. [102] have performed a
combined analysis of the results of several clinical trials in
patients with oa, ra or chronic low-back pain. the rates of
confirmed cardiovascular thrombotic events (per 100
patients years) were numerically higher in  xxxd2069xxx  (60
mg/day) vs naproxen (1000 mg/day) users but comparable vs
placebo. however, to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of
rofecoxib and  xxxd2069xxx , a prospective, randomized,
controlled trial on 30.000 patients at risk of developing
adverse cardiovascular events will be performed. the
cardiovascular safety of  xxxd3481xxx  was assessed in a
combined analysis of 4 randomized, placebo-controlled trials
(up to 3 months of duration). the incidence of serious
thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebro and peripheral vascular,
or arterial thrombotic events) associated with  xxxd3481xxx 
(10-80 mg daily, n=1945) was compared with naproxen (500
mg b.i.d, n=744) and placebo (n=529) in patients with ra.
the results of this analysis showed no differences in the
incidence of any serious thrombotic events among treatments
groups [103], however, it should be pointed out that it is
based on a comparison of a very small number of events.
about  xxxd2517xxx , the target trial will also evaluate
the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients taking and
not taking low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection in
combination with  xxxd2517xxx  as secondary end-points, thus
offering the chance to address the question not only of the

tacconelli et al.

long-term incidence of ulcer complications, but also of
cardiovascular events.
more information are needed on the cardiovascular
effects of selective cox-2 inhibitors. however, patients with
arthritis who have had a major cardiovascular event should
be treated with low-dose aspirin in combination with a
highly selective cox-2 inhibitor. in contrast, the
coadministration of a nonselective nsaid with aspirin
should be avoided. in fact, the concomitant administration of
the nonselective nsaid ibuprofen, but not rofecoxib, has
been shown to antagonize the irreversible inhibition of
platelet cox-1 activity by low-dose aspirin [104].
on the other hand, it should be mentioned that selective
cox-2 inhibition may have potential beneficial effects in
addition to low-dose aspirin in the setting of acute coronary
syndromes. thus, cox-2 expressed in inflammatory cells
[26, 105, 106] may account for aspirin-resistant txa2
biosynthesis in acute coronary syndromes [107, 108].
enhanced baseline urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-txb2 (a
major enzymatic metabolite of txa2) predicted the future
risk of mi or cardiovascular death in a subgroup of high-risk
aspirin-treated patients participating in the hope trial [109].
however, whether the coadministration of low-dose aspirin
with a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor will maintain the
advantage of a coxib over a nonselective nsaid with
respect to gi side effects remains to be tested.
conclusions
novel selective cox-2 inhibitors with different cox1/cox-2 selectivity and pharmacokinetics features have
been developed. the improved biochemical selectivity of
 xxxd3481xxx  vs celecoxib may be clinically relevant leading to
an improved gi safety, however this is not sustantiated by
the results of appropriate clinical trials. interestingly,
 xxxd2849xxx , a pro-drug of  xxxd3481xxx , is the only injectable
coxib. similarly to rofecoxib,  xxxd2069xxx  reaches a specific
cox-2 inhibition that should translate into a similar gi
safety.  xxxd2517xxx , the most selective cox-2 inhibitor in
vitro, is the only acidic coxib. it has been hypothesized that
this pecular chemical feature may lead to an enhanced
concentration in inflammatory sites that may translate into an
improved clinical efficacy.
the results of clinical trials have shown that the novel
coxibs have a camparable clinical efficacy in oa, ra and
acute pain. however, it should be pointed out that is quite
difficult to detect differences in efficacy in comparative
clinical trials because of the low sensitivity of the clinical
end-points utilized. the occurrence of renal side-effects that
seem to be dose-dependent limits the use of higher doses.
similarly to the first coxibs, it is imperative to evaluate their
renal toxicity in high-risk patients in long-term treatment.
more information are needed also on the cardiovascular and
gi toxicity of the novel coxibs. large-size clinical trials have
been designed to address these issues and are ongoing.
