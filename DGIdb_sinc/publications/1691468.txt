antagonism of  xxxg1116xxx  mediated currents in murine n1e-115 neuroblastoma cells by (+)- xxxd3456xxx .   xxxg1116xxx -mediated membrane currents were recorded from voltage-clamped clonal n1e-115 neuroblastoma cells. the inward current response to ionophoretically applied serotonin (5-ht) was reversibly antagonised by the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists gr 38032f and metoclopramide with ic50 values of 0.2 nm and 14 nm, respectively. low concentrations of (+)- xxxd3456xxx  [+)-tc) also blocked the response to 5-ht (ic50 = 0.8 nm), but other nicotinic cholinoceptor antagonists ( xxxd2174xxx , vecuronium and  xxxd3439xxx ) were ineffective when applied at a relatively high concentration (1 microm). blockade by (+)-tc was neither voltage- nor use-dependent, suggesting that (+)-tc does not block 5-ht-activated ion channels in n1e-115 cells.
