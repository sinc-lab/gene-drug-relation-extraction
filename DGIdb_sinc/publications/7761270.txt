a b s t r a c t , we have investigated the effect of 4 ganglionic
cholinergic antagonists (hexamethonium,  xxxd2550xxx ,
 xxxd2877xxx ,  xxxd3439xxx ) on rat 0t3[~2 and ot3[~4 neuronal
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) expressed in
xenopus oocytes. current responses were elicited by fast
application of acetylcholine on voltage-clamped oocytes
(holding potentialvh = - 8 0 m v ) . concentration-inhibition
curves were used to get estimates of ic50, the antagonist
concentration yielding 50% reduction of the peak current.
the kb's of the antagonists were calculated using estimates
of the apparent kd of acetylcholine. the order of affinity of
the antagonists was similar for both receptor subtypes:
 xxxd2550xxx  =  xxxd2877xxx  > hexamethonium >
 xxxd3439xxx . however, oc3[~4 neuronal nachrs were 9 to
22 times more sensitive to each of the 4 antagonists than
a3[~2 receptors. t h e s e results further underline the
importance of the ~-subunit as co-determinant of the
functional properties of neuronal nachrs.

combinations such as 2 different  xxxg220xxx  isoforms with
one [3 subunit [3, 9].
a number of studies based on the expression of neuronal
nachrs in xenopus oocytes has begun to shed some light
on the functional properties of receptors of known subunitcomposition [7]. both agonist-binding (a) and non-binding
(9) subunits determine the sensitivity of the receptor
subtypes to cholinergic agonists and toxins [7], to substance
p [8], to (+)- xxxd3456xxx  [1], their kinetic properties [5], or
the time course of desensitization [review 4].
the aim of the present study was to investigate the role
of [3-subunits in determining the sensitivity of neuronal
nicotinic receptors to four c o m m o n l y used ganglionic
antagonists (hexamethonium,  xxxd2550xxx ,  xxxd2877xxx 
and  xxxd3439xxx ).

introduction
the family of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs)
groups hetero-pentameric membrane proteins responsible for
fast cholinergic synaptic transmission. it includes two
receptor types characterized by subunit composition and
stoichiometry: m u s c l e - t y p e receptors consist of four
different subunits (a21378 or a 2 ~ e s ) whereas neuronal
nachrs consist of only two subunits (c~ and ~) with a
likely stoichiometry of ot2133 [7]. a large number of clones
encoding neuronal nachrs subunits have been characterized
(c~2-c~8, ~ 2 - ~ 4 ) . several c o m b i n a t i o n s o f m r n a s
encoding (one) ot and [3 subunit isoform yields functional
neuronal nachrs after injection into xenopus oocytes.

messenger rna preparation and injection were done according to
standard techniques. capped mrnas were prepared from cdna clones
encoding a3 (pca48e(3)), 132 (pcx49(i)) and 134 (pzpc13) rat neuronal
nicotinic receptor subunits using in vitro transcription by t3 or t7
polymerase in the presence of 5'7megpppg 5' cap analogue and poly
(a)+ tailed using poly (a)+ polymerase (boehringer). combinations of c~and 13-subunit mrnas were re-suspended in 5 mm hepes solution (ph
7.4) yielding a concentration of approximately 160 ng mrna / gl. this
solution was then injected into xenopus oocytes (dumont stages 5 or 6)
(50 nl/oocyte).
agonist-evoked responses were measured in denuded, voltageclamped oocytes (holding potential, vh = -80 mv) four to twelve days
after mrna injection (amplifier: axoclamp 2a, axon instruments,
foster city, ca, usa). individual responses were recorded on video-tape
using a digitizing interface (vr10a, instrutech corp, elmont, ny, usa).
data were later amplified and played back through a low-pass filter (fc =
10 hz, -3db, bessel filter) prior to re-sampling (fs = 10 hz) using a
micro-computer and a programmable interface (cambridge electronics
design, ced1401 / programm chart, version 2.0). data analysis, curve
fitting (marquardt-levenberg method) and plotting were done on a

450
macintosh microcomputer using commercially available software
(kaleidagraph, version 3.0; synergy software, reading, pa, usa).
the external solution consisted of 90 mm  xxxg2020xxx , 1 mm kci, 1 mm
mgc12, 1 mm cac12, 5 mm na-hepes (ph adjusted to 7.4 with naoh).
aliquots of acetylcholine chloride, hexamethonium chloride,  xxxd2877xxx 
di(l(+)-tartrate),  xxxd2550xxx  hydrochloride (all sigma chemicals,

solutions were diluted in external solution to the required final
concentration. solutions were applied through a glass tube (inner
diameter = 1.2 nun) placed above the equator of the oocyte and directed
at the oocyte's animal pole (10-15 ml/min into a 250 ~1 chamber).
estimates of ic50 , the antagonist concentration which reduces peak
currents by 50% were obtained by fitting following empirical equation to
the normalised data points: l(x) = 100 (1 - (xn / (xn + ics0n)) (eq. 1),
where i(x ) is the normalised current response, x is the antagonist
concentration and n the slope of the inhibition curve. estimates of kb, the
equilibrium dissociation constant of the antagonist, were calculated using
following equation (cheng-prusoff relation): k b = (ic50 / (1 + xa/ka) )
(eq. 2), where x a is the agonist concentration and k a the apparent
equilibrium dissociation constant of the receptor for acetylcholine. the
estimates of k a were taken from a parallel study done on the same
oocyte batches [1]. acetylcholine did not elicit any detectable response in
non-injected denuded oocytes.

fig. i a-b. inhibition of acetylcholine-evoked current responses by
hexamethonium in 0t3132(a) and c~3154(b) neuronal nicotinic receptors.
acetylcholine with and without hexamethonium were applied for 24
seconds (solid bar). holding current was subtracted from each trace prior
to plot. desensitization was much less pronounced in ct3134 receptors (b)
although a 10-fold higher agonist concentration (20 p.m) was used to
evoke responses. the co-applied hexamethonium concentration is
indicated in the left column. oocytes were obtained from the same donor
and the experiments done on 2 consecutive days.

results

current responses (peak current amplitude 0.3 - 1 p-a) were
elicited by applying concentrations of 2 p-m acetylcholine
(ach) to c~3~2 nachrs or 20 p-m ach to ~3[~4 nachrs
onto voltage-clamped xenopus oocytes (fig. 1). control
applications were repeated a few times with a delay of 6-9
min between applications following which peak cmtents of
reproducible size were obtained. antagonist concentrations
between 15 nm to 50 p-m were then co-applied at the same
intervals together with the above-mentioned ach
concentrations (fig. 1).
the peak current obtained during each application was
then normalised with respect to the peak current evoked by
ach alone. the normalised peak responses were plotted
against the antagonist concentration (fig. 2) and fitted with
an empirical inhibition curve as explained in the methods
section (see legend of fig. 2 for parameter estimates). the
order of potency of the inhibitors was the same for both
receptor subtypes but the concentrations of each antagonist
required for half-maximal inhibition of cz3~4 nachrs was
smaller by a factor of 9 to 22 compared to cz3~32 nachrs.
the slope of the inhibition curves were between 0.9 and 1.0
for all curves except for those of  xxxd2877xxx  and
 xxxd2550xxx  on c~3132nachrs (with estimates of 0.6 and
0.7, respectively) the smaller slope was observed in the
original data and was not due to pooling of divergent data.
estimates of ka for acetylcholine determined in the same
batches of oocytes (44 p.m: c~3~32nachrs; 52 p-m: c~3~4
nachrs, [1]) were used to calculate the kb's of the antago-

nists for each receptor subtype. for c~3132 receptors, the
calculated kb's were 8.3 p-m (hexamethonium), 2.8 p-m
( xxxd2550xxx ), 3.3 p-m ( xxxd2877xxx ) and 12p-m
( xxxd3439xxx ). for ~3134 nachrs, the kb's were 310 nm
(hexamethonium), 140 nm ( xxxd2550xxx ), 110 nm
( xxxd2877xxx ) and 1.1 p.m ( xxxd3439xxx ).

discussion

we have compared the sensitivity of rat 0t3132 and a3134
neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs)
expressed in xenopus oocytes to four ganglionic
antagonists. these antagonists inhibited the acetylcholineevoked responses with the same order of potency
( xxxd2550xxx  =  xxxd2877xxx  > hexamethonium >
 xxxd3439xxx ) in both receptor subtypes. the ic50 of o~3~34
nachrs were 9 to 22 times lower for each antagonist than
those of ot3~2 receptors. the ratios of the calculated kb's
varied between 11 ( xxxd3439xxx ) and 30 ( xxxd2877xxx ).
average peak currents of similar size were obtained in
c~3~2 nachrs (473 na) and a3134 (507 na) nachrs
despite the use of a 10-fold higher ach concentration (20
p-m) for the latter receptor subtype and the similar kd for
ach for both subtypes [1]. the most likely explanation for
this discrepancy is that the level of expression of c~3~34
nachrs was lower for than for c~3132 receptors. the
primary consequences of the application of a higher ach
concentration on c~3134 n a c h r s are a shift of the

in the presence of each antagonist concentration were
normalised with respect to the peak current evoked by the
agonist alone (fig. 1). smooth curves (dotted lines) are fits of
the empirical inhibition equation to the data points (eq. 1,
methods).the concentrations yielding half-maximal inhibition of
the ach-evoked responses (ic50) of nachrs (estimates + error
of estimates) were : a) hexamethonium: 8.7 +_0.8 i.tm (~3132),
430 + 19 nm (~3134) b) mecamvlamine: 2.9 + 0.4 gm (og132),
190 5:26 nm (0~3134)c) dentolinium: 3.4 5:0.6 i.tm (0~3132),
160 5:9 nm (~3134) d) trimetaohan: 12.5 + 1.2 gm (o~3132),
1.5 5:0.2 gm (0~3134). the calculated kb's are shown in the text.

inhibition curve to the right and biased estimates of ic50.
on the other hand the use of different agonist concentrations
is accounted for in the calculation of kb's (see eq. 2).
our results are consistent with recently presented data
(cohen et ai., soc. neurosci. abstract [2]): their estimates
of ic50 of c~3132 and ~x3134 rat neuronal nachrs receptors
for hexamethonium were 30 and 1.4 gm, respectively.
these values are about 3 times higher than our estimates,
most probably as a consequence of the higher ach
concentration (30 gm) used. the ratio of the ic50 is,
however, almost identical in both studies.
our study does not provide information about the
mechanism which could explain the different effect of the
antagonist on two receptor subtypes. it is known that a
number of cholinergic antagonists are not only competitive
antagonists of acetylcholine but that they may also block
the ion-channel. the channel-blocking effect of
hexamethonium on rat neuronal nicotinic receptors
(submandibular ganglion) is well documented. it has also
been shown that the mean open time of c~3134 nachrs
expressed in xenopus oocytes is larger than that of cx3132
nachrs [6]. it could, therefore, be argued that open-channel
block is more likely to happen in ct3134 receptors.
comparison of our results with the above-mentioned study
[2] confirm this hypothesis: increasing the ach
concentration from 20 to 30 i-tm causes a 3-fold increase of
ic50 in 0~3134 nachrs. with o~3~2 nachrs, a 15-fold
increase in ach concentration (from 2 to 30 ].tm) yields the
same 3-fold increase of ic50. thus both studies underline
the strong difference in the effect of hexamethonium on
these two neuronal nachrs subtypes.
the functional significance of the different sensitivity of
neuronal nachrs to antagonists will only emerge when a
complete clarification of the subunit composition of native
neuronal nicotinic receptors has been achieved. among
others, a step in that direction has been recently done by
showing that in rat submandibular and other autonomic
ganglia the c~3 and 134 genes have high levels of expression
