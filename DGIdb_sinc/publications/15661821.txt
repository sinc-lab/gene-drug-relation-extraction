in the present study, our aim was to determine whether intrafetal glucose infusion increases
fetal adiposity, synthesis and secretion of leptin and regulates gene expression of the
‘appetite regulatory’ neuropeptides neuropepetide y (npy), agouti-related peptide (agrp),
 xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (cart)
and receptors ( xxxg1320xxx  (ob-rb) and melancortin 3 receptor (mc3r)) within the fetal
hypothalamus. glucose (50% dextrose in saline) or saline was infused (7.5 ml h−1 ) into fetal sheep
between 130 and 140 days gestation (term = 150 ± 3 days gestation). glucose infusion increased
circulating glucose and insulin concentrations, mean lipid locule size (532.8 ± 3.3 µm2 versus
456.7 ± 14.8 µm2 ) and total unilocular fat mass (11.7 ± 0.6 g versus 8.9 ± 0.6 g) of the perirenal
fat depot. the expression of ob-rb mrna was higher in the ventromedial nucleus compared to
the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in both glucose and saline infused fetuses (f = 8.04;
p < 0.01) and there was a positive correlation between expression of ob-rb and mc3r mrna
in the arcuate nucleus (r = 0.81; p < 0.005). glucose infusion increased mrna expression for
pomc, but not for the anorectic neuropeptide cart, or the orexigenic neuropeptides npy
and agrp, in the arcuate nucleus of the fetal hypothalamus. these findings demonstrate that
increased circulating glucose and insulin regulate gene expression of the neuropeptides within
the fetal hypothalamus that are part of the neural network regulating energy balance in adult
life.

in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes, the
fetus is hyperglycaemic and hyperinsulinaemic, and cord
blood leptin concentrations increase in parallel with
increased infant adiposity (cetin et al. 2000; tapanainen
et al. 2001). furthermore, maternal diabetes mellitus,
gestational diabetes or even mildly impaired glucose
tolerance during pregnancy are all risk factors for the
development of obesity and type ii diabetes in the offspring
(plagemann et al. 1997; silverman et al. 1998). it has
therefore been proposed that exposure to excess nutrient
supply during critical windows of fetal development may
result in permanent changes within either the appetite
regulatory system or the adipocyte to result in increased

adiposity in adult life (martin et al. 1998; plagemann et al.
1999).
glucose, insulin and leptin act through a range
of mechanisms in the adult to alter hypothalamic
expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides, neuropeptide
y (npy) and agouti-related peptide (agrp), and the
anorexigenic precursor,  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc),
and neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
transcript (cart), and thereby contribute to energy
balance regulation (ahima et al. 1996; kalra et al. 1999;
williams et al. 2001). in species, such as the rat, with
significant brown fat deposits, leptin also acts centrally to
control energy expenditure by regulating expression of the

uncoupling protein,  xxxg2374xxx , in brown adipocytes (scarpace
et al. 1997).
npy containing projections develop between the
arcuate nucleus (arc), the dorsomedial hypothalamus
(dmh) and paraventricular nucleus (pvn) of the
hypothalamus during the first two weeks of life in the
rat (grove & smith, 2003). this early postnatal period
is also a critical period for the programming of appetite
and adiposity, and overnutrition during this time induces
permanent alterations in the hypothalamic neurones that
express the appetite-regulating neuropeptides, leading to
persistent hyperphagia and associated obesity (plagemann
et al. 1999). whilst the appetite regulatory system develops
postnatally in the rat, components of this neural network
are expressed before birth in more precocial species, such
as humans and sheep (koutcherov et al. 2003; muhlhausler
et al. 2004). although fetal glucose and insulin are positive
regulators of fat deposition and leptin mrna expression
(muhlhausler et al. 2003), it is not known whether
increases in fetal nutrient supply can alter the expression
of ‘appetite regulatory’ neuropeptides in the fetal hypothalamus.
our aim therefore was to determine whether a 10 day
intrafetal glucose infusion during late gestation increased
lipid locule size, fetal fat mass, adipose leptin mrna
expression and circulating leptin and regulated the
gene expression of the  xxxg1320xxx  (ob-rb) and
melanocortin receptor (mc3r), and of the appetite
regulatory neuropeptides npy and agrp (appetite
stimulation) and pomc and cart (appetite inhibition)
within the fetal sheep hypothalamus.
methods
animals and surgery

all procedures were approved by the university of adelaide
animal ethics committee. surgery was performed on
12 adult merino ewes between 118 and 120 days (d)
gestation (term = 150 ± 3 d) using aseptic techniques.
general anaesthesia was induced by intravenous injection
of sodium  xxxd3354xxx  (1.25 g i.v., pentothal, rhone
merieux, pinkenba, qld, australia) and maintained with
2.5–4% halothane ( xxxd2261xxx , ici, melbourne, vic.,
australia) in oxygen. vascular catheters were implanted
in a jugular vein of the ewe, in a jugular vein
and carotid artery of the fetus, and in the amniotic
cavity, as previously described (edwards & mcmillen,
2001). during surgery, antibiotics (norocillin: norbrook
laboratories ltd, new gisborne vic., australia and
dihydrostreptomycin in sterile saline: sigma, st louis,
mo, usa) were administered to each ewe and fetus via
intramuscular injection. all catheters were filled with
heparinized saline and the fetal catheters exteriorized
through an incision in the ewe’s flank. the analgesic

j physiol 565.1

xylazine (0.02 mg kg−1 ) was administered to all ewes in
the immediate postoperative period.
ewes were housed in individual pens in animal holding
rooms with a 12 h : 12 h light–dark cycle. ewes were
allowed at least 4 days to recover from surgery before
experimentation. ewes were fed a diet comprising lucerne
chaff and concentrated pellets (ridley agriproducts,
murray bridge, australia) calculated to provide 100% of
the maintenance energy requirements for a pregnant ewe
bearing a singleton fetus (aldermann et al. 1975). water
was provided ad libitum.
blood sampling regime

between 124 and 130 d gestation, maternal (3.0 ml) and
fetal (3.0 ml) arterial blood samples were collected three
times weekly. fetal blood was then collected 3 h prior to
the start of glucose or saline infusion (130 d gestation),
each day for the first 4 days of infusion, and every 2 days
thereafter until postmortem (139 ± 1 d gestation). blood
samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min at 4◦ c and
plasma stored at −20◦ c for subsequent hormone and
metabolite measurements. fetal arterial blood (0.5 ml) was
collected at each time point for measurement of fetal blood
gases and ph using an abl 520 analyser (radiometer,
copenhagen, denmark).
glucose infusion

at 130 d gestation, fetuses were randomly assigned to
receive either saline (n = 6) or glucose (n = 6) via
continuous intravenous infusion. infusion of glucose
(50% dextrose 500 g l−1 in sterile saline) or sterile saline
(vehicle) via the fetal jugular vein commenced at an initial
rate of 1.9 ml h−1 at 130 d gestation. the infusion rate
was increased incrementally by 1.9 ml h−1 per day for the
subsequent 3 days, until the final rate of 7.5 ml h−1 was
achieved on day 4; this infusion rate was then maintained
until postmortem. this infusion rate was derived from a
previous protocol in which this infusion level was shown
to induce significant fetal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia in the absence of any detrimental effects on
fetal well-being (stevens et al. 1990).
postmortem and tissue collection

between 138 and 140 d gestation (8–10 days after
commencement of glucose or saline infusion), ewes
were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone
(virbac pty ltd, peakhurst, nsw, australia). fetal sheep
were delivered by hysterotomy, weighed and killed by
decapitation. all adipose tissue from the perirenal adipose
tissue (pat) depot was excised and weighed. a sample of
pat was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate

buffer for subsequent processing and histological analyses.
a second pat sample was snap frozen in liquid n2 and
stored at −80◦ c (muhlhausler et al. 2003). the whole brain
was excised, frozen in isopentane over dry ice and stored
at −80◦ c.
glucose, insulin and leptin assays

maternal and fetal plasma glucose concentrations were
determined by enzymatic analysis using the cobas
mira automated analysis system (roche diagnostica,
basel, switzerland) previously validated for sheep plasma
(edwards & mcmillen, 2001). the intra- and interassay
coefficients of variation were both < 5%.
insulin concentrations were determined in fetal plasma
samples using a radioimmunoassay kit (phadaseph radioimmunoassay kit, pharmacia & upjohn, uppsala, sweden)
previously validated for sheep plasma (edwards &
mcmillen, 2001). the inter- and intra-assay coefficients
of variation were both < 20%.
a competitive elisa, previously validated for sheep
plasma (kauter et al. 2000) was used to determine
plasma leptin concentrations in fetal plasma samples. the
sensitivity of the assay was 0.5 ng ml−1 and the inter- and
intra-assay coefficients of variation were both < 10%.
rna extraction

total rna was extracted from ∼100 mg of pat from each
experimental animal following the standard sigma tri
reagent protocol as previously described (yuen et al. 1999;
muhlhausler et al. 2003). the rna pellet was resuspended
in sterile water (20 µl). the ratio of spectrophotometric
absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was always > 1.6, rna yield
was 0.13 ± 0.02 µg rna per mg adipose tissue and rna
integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
leptin and  xxxg53xxx  mrna

ovine leptin and  xxxg53xxx  cdna were amplified by reverse
transcription (rt)–pcr as previously described (yuen
et al. 1999; muhlhausler et al. 2003; yuen et al. 2003).
the sequences of the primers for the amplification of the
leptin cdna (183 bp) and  xxxg53xxx  cdna (349 bp) have
been published and validated previously (yuen et al. 1999).
each pcr product (12 µl) was electrophoresed through a
2.0% (w/v) agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide,
transilluminated with uv radiation, scanned with a
bio-rad molecular imager and quantified using quantity
one image analysis software (bio-rad laboratories,
richmond, ca, usa). the rt-pcr was performed in
duplicate on rna from each adipose tissue sample. the
relative abundance of leptin mrna was calculated by
referencing the intensity of the leptin amplicon to the
intensity of the  xxxg53xxx  amplicon for each fetus.

 xxxg2374xxx  mrna and 18s rrna

the expression of  xxxg2374xxx  mrna and 18s rrna in 15 µg
of pat rna was determined using standard northern
blotting techniques described in detail elsewhere (adams
et al. 1999; muhlhausler et al. 2003). oligonucleotides
(geneworks, adelaide, sa, australia) complementary to
nucleotides 267–298 of rat  xxxg2374xxx  (genbank acc. no.
nm012682) (bouillaud et al. 1986) and nucleotides
151–180 of rat 18s rrna (chan et al. 1984)
were end-labelled with [32 p] xxxd1148xxx  (4000 ci mmol−1 ;
gra-32 u, geneworks, adelaide, australia) as previously
described (adams et al. 1999; muhlhausler et al. 2003).
the hybridization signal was quantified with fuji-macbas
software and the relative abundance of  xxxg2374xxx  mrna
calculated by referencing the intensity of the  xxxg2374xxx  mrna
band to the intensity of the 18s rrna band for each fetus.

hypothalamic gene expression

coronal sections (20 µm) of fetal sheep hypothalami were
collected between the mamillary body (caudal) and the
optic chiasm (rostral). sections were thaw-mounted onto
slides double-coated with gelatin and poly-l-lysine and
stored at −80◦ c until analysis of mrna expression.
a riboprobe complementary to fragments of the
intracellular domain of ob-rb was generated from cloned
sheep cdna as previously described (mercer et al. 1998).
the npy riboprobe was generated from a rat cdna
(higuchi et al. 1988) and the cart riboprobe from a
cloned sheep cdna (barrett et al. 2001). agrp and pomc
probes were generated from cloned siberian hamster
cdna (mercer et al. 2000) and the mc3r riboprobe was
generated from human genomic cdna (adam et al. 2000).
all probes were previously validated in adult sheep brain
tissues (adam et al. 1997; adam et al. 2002; sorensen et al.
2002).
expression of mrna for pomc, cart, npy,
agrp, ob-rb and mc3r in the fetal hypothalamus
was detected by in situ hybridization using methods
described in detail elsewhere (mercer et al. 1995;
adam et al. 1997). all reagents were obtained from
sigma (sigma uk, poole, dorset, uk) unless otherwise
stated. hybridized, radiolabelled slides were air-dried at
room temperature, and apposed to hyperfilm beta-max
(amersham pharmacia biotech, uk ltd, little chalfont,
buckinghamshire, uk). the resulting autoradiographic
films were scanned at high resolution, and localization
of specific hybridization signals confirmed in the resulting
images using computerized densitometry measurements
(image-pro plus, media cybergenetics, silver spring, md,
usa). the integrated intensity of the hybridization signal
was computed using standard curves generated from
14
c autoradiographic microscales (amersham pharmacia
biotech). for each probe, up to nine sections spanned

gene expression, and there was no evidence for consistent
differences between these regions, the data were averaged
to give a single value for arc gene expression for each
animal.
adipose tissue histology

sections (4 µm) of pat were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (he) and examined using an olympus
bh2 microscope (20× objective and 2.5× nfk photo
eyepiece). standard point counting techniques were used
with video image analysis (via) using video pro software
(leading edge, adelaide, sa, australia) to determine the
volume density of unilocular and multilocular tissue in
pat as previously described (muhlhausler et al. 2002; yuen
et al. 2003). the volume density (v d ) was calculated using
the formula: v d = n /t , where n is the number of points
falling on the unilocular or multilocular component, and
t is the total number of points counted. the mass of
the unilocular and multilocular component of fetal pat
were calculated by multiplying total pat mass by the
appropriate v d (muhlhausler et al. 2003).
for each experimental animal, the perimeter of 200
lipid locules with a cross-sectional area > 10 µm2 was
manually traced and the area-pro software package (video
pro image analysis, leading edge, adelaide, sa, australia)
used to determine the enclosed area (muhlhausler et al.
2003).

using student’s t test. the effect of glucose infusion on the
expression of mrna for npy, agrp, pomc and cart
and for ob-rb and mc3r in the hypothalamus was also
determined using a t test.
fetal plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin and
leptin between 135 and 140 d gestation were averaged
to obtain a mean value for glucose, insulin and leptin
concentrations during this period. simple linear regression
analysis was then used to determine relationships between
mean fetal glucose, insulin and leptin concentrations,
and mean lipid locule size in pat, total pat mass and
the leptin :  xxxg53xxx  mrna or  xxxg2374xxx  : 18s rrna ratios,
and hypothalamic gene expression of ob-rb, mc3r and
the ‘appetite regulating’ neuropeptides. linear regression
analysis was also used to determine relationships between
expression of npy, agrp, pomc, cart, mc3r and
ob-rb mrna in the fetal arc or vmh. a probability
of 5% (p < 0.05) was taken as the level of significance in
all analyses.
results
fetal arterial blood gas status and plasma glucose
and insulin concentrations

there were no differences in fetal arterial blood gas
and ph values between the saline and glucose infused
groups either prior to the start of glucose or saline
infusion (data not shown) or during the infusion
period (table 1). before the start of the infusion, there
were no differences in fetal plasma glucose and insulin
concentrations between fetuses assigned to the saline
or glucose infusion protocols. fetal plasma glucose and
insulin concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05)
than preinfusion concentrations from 24 h and 72 h,
respectively, after the start of glucose infusion (fig. 1a
and b). plasma glucose and insulin concentrations did not
change during the saline infusion period.
size of lipid locules and mass of fetal perirenal
adipose tissue and fetal and placental growth

glucose infusion resulted in an increase (p < 0.05) in the
mean size of the lipid locules in the pat depot (table 2).

there was also a direct correlation between the mean size
of lipid locules and the mean plasma glucose, but not
insulin, concentrations (mean locule size (µm2 ) = 42.9
(fetal glucose) + 422; r = 0.79, n = 10; p < 0.01). glucose
infusion resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in
total unilocular, but not multilocular, fat mass at 140 d

gestation (table 2). there was no dissectible subcutaneous
adipose tissue in either saline infused or glucose infused
fetuses. there was no effect of glucose infusion on placental
weight (saline, 436.3 ± 52.8 g; glucose, 468.9 ± 24.9 g)
or fetal weight (saline, 4.84 ± 0.2 kg; glucose, 5.12 ±

leptin mrna and  xxxg2374xxx  mrna expression
in fetal perirenal adipose tissue and circulating
leptin concentrations

there was no effect of glucose infusion on the relative
expression of leptin mrna (saline, 0.58 ± 0.06; glucose,
0.66 ± 0.12) or  xxxg2374xxx  mrna (saline, 0.46 ± 0.06; glucose,
0.49 ± 0.07) in fetal pat. in the glucose but not saline
infused fetuses, however, there was a positive correlation
between the relative abundance of leptin mrna in
fetal pat and the mean plasma concentrations of
either insulin (leptin mrna: beta actin mrna = 0.07
(fetal insulin) − 0.096; r = 0.81; n = 6; p < 0.05) or
glucose (leptin mrna: beta actin mrna = 0.52 (fetal
glucose) − 0.70; r = 0.94; n = 6; p < 0.01).
before the start of the infusion, there was no difference
in fetal plasma leptin concentrations between fetuses
assigned to either the saline (3.5 ± 0.6 ng ml−1 ) or the
glucose (4.7 ± 0.8 ng ml−1 ) infusion protocols. there was
no difference in plasma leptin concentrations between
saline and glucose infused fetuses at any time point either
prior to or after the start of infusion (table 3). fetal plasma
leptin concentrations did not change during the infusion
period when compared with baseline concentrations in
either the glucose or saline infused fetuses (fig. 1c).
there was no relationship between circulating leptin
concentrations and either the total or relative fat or
unilocular fat mass in either the glucose and saline infused
fetuses.

ob-rb, mc3r, pomc, cart, npy and agrp mrna
expression in the fetal hypothalamus

ob-rb and mc3r mrnas were localized predominantly
within the arc and vmh (fig. 2a–d). the level of ob-rb
mrna expression was higher (f = 8.04; p < 0.01) in the
vmh than in the arc in both glucose and saline infused
fetuses (fig. 2e). there was no effect of glucose infusion
on the level of ob-rb or mc3r mrna expression in the
arc or vmh. there was a positive correlation between

the expression of mrna for ob-rb and mc3r within the
arc (r = 0.81; n = 11; p < 0.005).
expression of pomc mrna was localized within
the arc in both glucose and saline infused fetuses
(fig. 3a and b). the level of pomc mrna expression
in the arc was higher (p < 0.04) in the hypothalami
of glucose infused compared with saline infused fetuses
at 140 d gestation (fig. 3c). there was no relationship,
however, between circulating glucose, insulin or leptin
concentrations and pomc mrna expression in either
group.
cart mrna was expressed in the arc, vmh and pvn
and there was no effect of glucose infusion on the level
of cart mrna expression (fig. 4a, b and c). npy and
agrp mrnas were localized within the arc, dorsomedial
hypothalamus (dmh) and median eminence (me) and
there was no effect of glucose infusion on their level of
expression (fig. 4d–i).
discussion
we have demonstrated that infusion of glucose into the
late gestation fetal sheep increases fetal glucose and insulin
concentrations, increases the size of the lipid locules within
the major fetal fat depot, and increases the expression of
mrna for the precursor molecule pomc in the arcuate
nucleus of the hypothalamus at 140 d gestation. these
results provide evidence that the expression of a hypothalamic neuropeptide known to regulate energy balance
in adult life also responds to changes in nutritional status
before birth.
intrafetal glucose infusion for 10 days in late gestation
resulted in an increase in the size of the dominant lipid
locules and in the total mass of unilocular perirenal
adipose tissue. the mean lipid locule size was also directly
related to fetal glucose, but not insulin, concentrations
during the infusion period in both saline and glucose
infused fetuses. this is consistent with previous findings
(muhlhausler et al. 2003), and suggests that glucose, rather
than insulin, is the principal determinant of lipid storage
in fetal adipocytes during late gestation. this is supported

in an increase in lipid locule size, it did not result in
a significant increase in relative fetal adiposity. it has
previously been reported that a 30 day infusion of glucose
in fetal sheep increased total fetal fat mass (stevens et al.
1990) and that the increased adiposity in infants of diabetic
mothers is directly related to maternal circulating glucose

concentrations (catalano et al. 2003). it may be that the
fetus is able to adapt to a 10 day, but not a more prolonged,
period of hyperglycaemia through mechanisms which
limit the impact of an increase in fetal glucose on fetal
adiposity. there is evidence that prolonged fetal hyperglycaemia is associated with a decline in adipose  xxxg2133xxx 
levels in the sheep fetus (das et al. 1999) which may be
one mechanism which acts to counter a chronic increase
in fetal nutrient supply.
in the present study, there was no effect of chronic
glucose infusion on leptin mrna expression in the fetal
perirenal adipose tissue. there was, however, a strong
positive relationship between either plasma insulin or
glucose concentrations and leptin mrna expression in
fetal adipose tissue in the glucose infused, but not saline

infused fetuses. this same direct relationship is also
present in fetuses of ewes fed at ∼55% above maintenance
energy requirements in late pregnancy (muhlhausler et al.
2003). insulin-responsive elements have been identified
within the promoter of the leptin gene in the adult
mouse and insulin up-regulates leptin gene transcription
in adipocytes of adult rodents (saladin et al. 1995; wang
et al. 2000). in the fetal sheep it has recently been reported
that intrafetal infusion of insulin for 24 h, resulting in fetal
insulin concentrations higher than 50 µu ml−1 , stimulates
a significant increase in leptin mrna expression in the
perirenal adipose tissue of the sheep fetus (devaskar et al.
2002). one possibility is that fetal adipose tissue may
be relatively insensitive to the actions of insulin or that
in the presence of moderate elevations in fetal insulin,

glucose and fetal appetite regulating neuropeptides

other mechanisms limit the actions of insulin on leptin
expression in the fetal adipocyte.
in the present study, there was no significant
relationship between plasma leptin concentrations and
either total or relative unilocular fat mass. this is in
contrast to our previous findings of a positive relationship
between fat mass and leptin concentrations in fetuses of
ewes fed at or above maintenance energy requirements in
late gestation (muhlhausler et al. 2002). whilst maternal
overnutrition was not associated with an increase in
fetal fat deposition, however, intrafetal glucose infusion
significantly increased lipid storage within fetal adipose
depots without altering plasma leptin. these results
therefore suggest that increasing fetal plasma glucose
concentrations beyond those achieved by modest maternal
overnutrition acts to alter the regulation of leptin secretion
and adipose tissue mass. one possible explanation is that
there may be a counter-regulatory mechanism which acts
to limit leptin synthesis and secretion from fetal adipose
cells when fetal glucose concentrations are increased
beyond a given threshold.
we have demonstrated that an increase in fetal glucose
concentrations between 130 and 140 days gestation
resulted in a significant increase in the expression of
mrna for the precursor molecule pomc in the arcuate
nucleus of the fetal sheep hypothalamus. this occurred
despite the fact that glucose infusion did not increase
circulating concentrations of leptin, which is a key
regulator of pomc expression in the adult (mizuno
et al. 1998). there is recent evidence that there are subpopulations of pomc-containing neurones in the mouse
hypothalamus that are glucose responsive, responding
to increases in extracellular glucose by an increase
in activity (dunn-meynell et al. 2002; ibrahim et al.
2003). furthermore, populations of pomc-containing
neurones have also been found to coexpress insulin
receptors and administration of insulin into the third
ventricle of fasted rats increases pomc mrna expression
(air et al. 2002). the results of the current study
suggest that expression of pomc in the arcuate neurones of the fetal hypothalamus may be responsive to
increases in glucose or insulin, acting either alone or in
combination.
the direct relationship between the expression of
ob-rb and mc3r expression in the fetal arcuate nucelus is
consistent with the known coexpression of these receptors
on pomc neurones in the arcuate nucleus in the adult
(cone et al. 2001). in the adult, cleavage of pomc
produces the melanocortin agonist,  xxxg1801xxx , which acts via
melanocortin receptors to limit weight gain by reducing
appetite and promoting thermogenic activation of brown
adipose tissue. whilst there was no difference in  xxxg2374xxx 
mrna expression in adipose tissue from glucose and saline
infused fetuses in the present study, this may not indicate



the absence of any thermogenic activation, since the
abundances of  xxxg2374xxx  mrna and protein within the same
adipose depot are not directly related (yuen et al. 2003). it
has been demonstrated that maternal overnutrition in late
pregnancy results in an increase in the thermogenic activity
and abundance of  xxxg2374xxx  protein in perirenal adipose
tissue and a decrease in adipose tissue mass in the fetal
sheep (budge et al. 2000). it is possible therefore that an
increase in hypothalamic pomc expression may act to
limit accumulation of fat in the fetus when the nutrient
supply is excessive.
there was no effect of intrafetal glucose infusion and
concomitant increases in circulating glucose and insulin
concentrations on gene expression for the orexigenic
neuropeptides npy and agrp. conversely, fetal hypothalamic npy content is increased following maternal
undernutrition in sheep (warnes et al. 1998). therefore,
fetal hypothalamic npy and agrp gene expression may
be relatively insensitive to increases in glucose or insulin
concentrations, but relatively sensitive to decreases in
nutrient supply, thus preserving an orexigenic pathway
that may be important to neonatal survival (ross et al.
2003).
we have demonstrated that the expression of ob-rb
is higher in the ventromedial compared to the arcuate
nucleus in the fetal sheep hypothalamus, in contrast to
the adult sheep or rodent in which ob-rb mrna is predominantly expressed within the arcuate nucleus (guan
et al. 1998; williams et al. 1999). this suggests that the
leptin axis undergoes further development after birth in
the sheep. in the adult rodent, the ventromedial nucleus
has been implicated as important for the regulation
of thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue (cannon
& nedergaard, 2003), and the higher level of ob-rb
expression in the fetal ventromedial hypothalamus may
indicate that leptin has a greater role in the regulation of the
thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue, rather than
‘energy intake’ during the perinatal period. consistent
with this role is the observation that infusion of leptin
into fetal sheep in late gestation resulted in an increase in
the proportion of multilocular tissue and  xxxg2374xxx  protein
abundance in fetal perirenal adipose tissue (yuen et al.
2003).
in summary, we have demonstrated that intrafetal
glucose infusion regulates gene expression of neuropeptides in the fetal hypothalamus that normally play a role
in the regulation of energy intake and energy expenditure
in adult life. an alteration in the regulation of appetite
regulatory neuropeptides within the fetal hypothalamus
is clearly one potential mechanism whereby a transplacental increase in substrate supply, such as occurs in
pregnancies complicated by maternal glucose intolerance,
may lead to a subsequent increase in childhood and adult
obesity.
