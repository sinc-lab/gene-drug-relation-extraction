beta 3 adrenergic receptors: molecular, histological, functional and pharmacological approaches.  different classes of receptors mediate norepinephrine and epinephrine effects, one of the most recently discovered being the beta 3 adrenergic ones. the paper has proposed itself to present the history of the discovery of beta 3 adrenergic receptors, different techniques for their identification, their structure, localization, genetic data and also the mechanism of regulation of their functions. it also contains an exhaustive approach regarding the histological localization and functions of beta 3 adrenergic receptors in different apparatus and systems, making evident their effect on glucidic, lipidic and energetic metabolism. the substances that influence beta 3 adrenergic receptors activities, especially the agonists, have been studied regarding their practical applications in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and of the disturbances of lipid metabolism.
