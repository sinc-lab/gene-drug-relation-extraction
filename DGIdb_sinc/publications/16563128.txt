aquaporin 2 (aqp2) and vasopressin type 2 receptor ( xxxg231xxx ) endocytosis in kidney epithelial cells: aqp2 is located in 'endocytosis-resistant' membran...  aquaporin 2 (aqp2) plays an important, vp (vasopressin)-regulated role in water reabsorption by the kidney. the amount of aqp2 expressed at the surface of principal cells results from an equilibrium between the aqp2 in intracellular vesicles and the aqp2 on the plasma membrane. vp shifts the equilibrium in favour of the plasma membrane and this allows osmotic equilibration to occur between the collecting duct lumen and the interstitial space. membrane accumulation of aqp2 could result from a vp-induced increase in exocytosis, a decrease in endocytosis, or both. in the present study, we further investigated aqp2 accumulation at the cell surface, and compared it with  xxxg231xxx  (vp type 2 receptor) trafficking using cells that express epitope-tagged aqp2 and  xxxg231xxx .
