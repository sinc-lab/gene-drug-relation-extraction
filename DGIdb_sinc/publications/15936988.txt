abstract
the effects of statins on immune response depend on the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-a (hmg-coa) reductase
and leukocyte function-associated antigen (lfa)-1, which is a ligand of intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1. simvastatin, an hmgcoa reductase inhibitor with mild inhibition of  xxxg1209xxx , induced the production of interleukin (il)-18,  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a and
interferon (ifn)-g in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). the il-18 production is located upstream of the cytokine cascade
activated by simvastatin. moreover, simvastatin concentration-dependently inhibited the expression of icam-1 and induced the expression
of cd40 on monocytes. in the presence of il-18, simvastatin suppressed the expression of icam-1 and cd40 as well as the production of
il-12,  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g in pbmc, contributing to the anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin. the effects of simvastatin were abolished by
the addition of the product of the  xxxg1060xxx , mevalonate, indicating the involvement of  xxxg1060xxx  in the action of
simvastatin.

introduction
the production of il-18, a monocyte-derived cytokine,
requires processing by  xxxg340xxx  [1]. il-18 is located on
upstream of the production of th1 cytokines [2,3]. the
engagement of adhesion molecules (icam-1/ xxxg1209xxx , b7/
cd28, cd40/ xxxg390xxx  ( xxxg390xxx )) between monocytes
and t-cells plays important roles in t-cell activation. il-18
up-regulated the expression of icam-1,  xxxg398xxx  and cd40 but
had no effect on  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg390xxx  expression on monocytes
[4,5]. the cell-to-cell interaction regulates the production of
il-18-initiated cytokines including il-12,  xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg1141xxx  in pbmc [4,5]. it was reported that the i domain of  xxxg1209xxx

was the binding site for icam-1 [6]. statins lower plasma
cholesterol levels, resulting in reduction of the risk of
cardiovascular disease [7]. simvastatin, a member of the
statin family of drugs that inhibit  xxxg1060xxx  [8],
binds to the i domain of  xxxg1209xxx  and inhibit its function [9].
in contrast, other statins such as pravastatin do not bind to
 xxxg1209xxx . previously, we reported that  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitors, pravastatin and fluvastatin, but not a statinderived  xxxg1209xxx  inhibitor, lfa-703, which did not inhibit
 xxxg1060xxx , induced the production of il-18,
 xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g in pbmc [10]. pravastatin and fluvastatin inhibited the expression of icam-1 and induced the
expression of cd40, whereas lfa703 had no effect [10]. in
the present study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin
on adhesion molecules expression and cytokine production
in pbmc.

materials and methods
reagents and drugs
recombinant human (rh) il-18, anti-il-18 monoclonal
ab (mab) and  xxxg340xxx  inhibitor z-tyr-val-ala-aspfluoromethyl ketone (yvad-fmk) were purchased from
mbl (nagoya, japan). yvad-fmk was dissolved in 0.3%
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso; mcb chemical) prepared with
0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline. simvastatin was kindly
provided by merck and co inc. (rahway, nj) and was
dissolved in pure water with 10% (v/v) ethanol. mevalonate
was purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo).
fitc-conjugated mouse igg1 mab against icam-1 and
pe-conjugated anti-cd14 mab was purchased from dako
(glostrup, denmark), and fitc-conjugated mouse igg1
mab against  xxxg396xxx  was purchased from immunotech
(marseille, france). in addition, fitc-conjugated mouse
igg1 mab against  xxxg398xxx  and cd40 was purchased from
pharmingen (san diego, ca), fitc-conjugated mouse
igg1 mab against  xxxg390xxx  was purchased from ancel
(bayport, mn), and fitc-conjugated igg1 class-matched
control (cmc) was purchased from sigma chemical.
preparation of pbmc
normal human pbmc were obtained from ten human
volunteers (age; 25 – 45) with their written informed
consent. samples of 50 ml of peripheral blood were
withdrawn from a forearm vein. pbmc were prepared and
suspended at a final concentration of 1  106 cells/ml in the
medium as described previously [4,5].
flow cytometric analysis
pbmc at 1  106 cells/ml were incubated for 24 h at
37-c in a 5% co2/air mixture under different conditions.
after the incubation, the cells at 5  105 cells/sample were
prepared for flow cytometric analysis as previously described [4,5]. changes in the expression of human leukocyte
antigens (icam-1,  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , cd40 and  xxxg390xxx ) on
monocytes were examined by double-labeling flow cytometry using a combination of 1 ag of pe-conjugated anticd14 ab with fitc-conjugated anti-icam-1, anti- xxxg396xxx ,
anti- xxxg398xxx , anti-cd40, anti- xxxg390xxx  abs or cmc. after
washing, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
and analyzed with a facs calibur (bd biosciences, san
jose, ca), and data were processed using the cell
quest program (bd biosciences). the data were
expressed as the relative fluorescence intensities against
cmc. the results were the means t sem of five donors.

il-10, quantikine, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) as
described previously [4,5].
statistical examination
the statistical significance of differences was evaluated
by anova followed by dunnett’s test. a probability value
less than 0.05 was considered significant.

results
effect of simvastatin on the production of il-18, il-12,
 xxxg2296xxx , ifn-c and il-10 in pbmc
pbmc at 1  106 cells/ml were treated with
increasing concentrations between 0 and 1 am of
simvastatin in the presence and absence of il-18 at
100 ng/ml. in the absence of il-18, simvastatin induced
il-18,  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g production (without il-12
production, data not shown) but inhibited il-10 production (fig. 1a). il-18 induced the production of il-12,
 xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g but inhibited il-10 production [4,5]. in
the presence of il-18, simvastatin inhibited the production of il-12,  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g but induced the
production of il-10 (fig. 1b). the solvent for simvastatin
had no effect in the presence and absence of il-18 (data
not shown).
effects of anti-il-18 mab and yvad-fmk on cytokine
responses induced by simvastatin in pbmc
pbmc at 1  106 cells/ml were treated with anti- xxxg1168xxx  mab  xxxd1891xxx  ng/ml and  xxxg340xxx  inhibitor (yvadfmk) at 100 nm in the presence of simvastatin at 1 am
(table 1). after 24 h incubation, the production of il-18,
il-12,  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g was determined by elisa.
simvastatin induced the production of il-18 (284 t
26 pg/ml), ifn-g (137 t 12 pg/ml) and  xxxg2296xxx  (131 t
8 pg/ml) without il-12 production. anti-il-18 mab
abolished the effect of 1 ng/ml il-18 on these cytokines
production. the treatment of anti-il-18 mab and yvadfmk inhibited the enhanced production of  xxxg2296xxx  and
ifn-g induced by simvastatin. the solvent for yvadfmk had no effect in the presence of il-18 or
simvastatin (data not shown).

of il-18 was determined by elisa. in the absence of
simvastatin, mevalonate alone had no effect on cytokine
production (data not shown). mevalonate abolished simvastatin-enhanced il-18,  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g production in
pbmc but enhanced il-10 production (fig. 1c). moreover,
mevalonate reversed the modulating effect of simvastatin at

(cd14+) was determined by double-labeling flow cytometry
(fig. 2a). in the presence of il-18, simvastatin inhibited the
expression of icam-1 and cd40. the expression of  xxxg396xxx ,
 xxxg398xxx  and  xxxg390xxx  was not changed by simvastatin in the
presence and absence of il-18 (data not shown).
effect of mevalonate on the action of simvastatin on the
expression of icam-1 and cd40 on monocytes
pbmc at 1  106 cells/ml were treated with mevalonate ranging between 0 and 100 am in the presence of

simvastatin at 1 am. after 24 h incubation, the expression
of icam-1 and cd40 on monocytes (cd14+) was
determined by double-labeling flow cytometry (fig. 2b).
mevalonate had no effect on the expression of icam-1
and cd40 (data not shown). mevalonate concentrationdependently reversed the modulatory effects of simvastatin
on the expression of icam-1 and cd40 in the absence of
il-18. moreover, mevalonate antagonized the modulatory
effect of simvastatin on the expression of icam-1 and
cd40 in the presence of high concentration of il-18 at
100 ng/ml.

discussion
simvastatin suppressed the production of il-12,  xxxg2296xxx 
and ifn-g (fig. 1b) and the expression of icam-1 and
cd40 (fig. 2a) in the presence of il-18. antibodies against
icam-1 and  xxxg398xxx  abolished the il-18-initiated cytokine
production in pbmc [4], whereas anti-cd40 ab had no
effect (data not shown). therefore, the adhesive events
mediated by the  xxxg1209xxx /icam-1 pathway might be involved
in the effects of simvastatin on cytokine production in the
presence of il-18. il-18 was involved in the pathogenesis
of diseases such as transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis
and sepsis [11 –13]. it was reported that anti-inflammatory
effect of simvastatin therapy reduced mortality in mouse

model of sepsis [14]. thus, simvastatin has therapeutic
potentials for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
however, little is known about the effect of simvastatin
on cytokine production and adhesion molecule expression in
the absence of il-18.
on the other hand, simvastatin induced il-18 production
in pbmc (fig. 1a) and isolated monocytes (data not
shown) without any other additional stimulation. simvastatin had no effect on the production of il-12,  xxxg2296xxx ? ifn-g
and il-10 in monocytes (data not shown) since these
cytokines require the cell-to-cell interaction between monocytes and t-cells [4,5]. il-18 is synthesized as a precursor
protein that requires cleavage with the il-1h-converting
enzyme (ice)/ xxxg340xxx  for activity as in the case of il-1h
[1]. after cleavage, the bioactive mature il-18 is secreted
from the cells. it is reported that yvad-fmk, a cellpermeable and irreversible inhibitor of  xxxg340xxx , inhibits
apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells [15] and
rheumatoid synoviocytes [16]. the inhibitor and anti- xxxg1168xxx  ab abolished simvastatin-elicited cytokine production
(table 1). the endogenous il-18 production is located
upstream of the production of  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g in pbmc
(fig. 1a and table 1). il-12 production was under detection
limit in pbmc treated with simvastatin (data not shown).
the profile of effect of simvastatin on cytokine production
is similar to the activators for cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp)- xxxg1836xxx  (pka) pathway, such as
histamine and epinephrine [5,17].  xxxd477xxx , a pka-inhibitor, did
not abolish the effect of statins, including simvastatin,
pravastatin and fluvastatin, on cytokine production in the
presence or absence of il-18 (data not shown), suggesting
that the camp-pka pathway might not be involved in the
effect of the statins. in the absence of il-18, simvastatin
suppressed the expression of icam-1 and induced the
expression of cd40 on monocytes (fig. 2a). although  xxxg1168xxx  at 1 ng/ml up-regulated the expression of icam-1 and
cd40 [4,5], anti-il-18 mab and yvad-fmk did not
change the effect of simvastatin alone at 1 am on the
expression of icam-1 and cd40 on monocytes (data not
shown). therefore, the endogenous il-18 might not be a
mediator for the modulation of icam-1 and cd40
expression.
in the previous study, we found that il-18 il-12,  xxxg2296xxx 
and ifn-g productions were detected in the medium of
human pbmc treated with  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors,
pravastatin and fluvastatin, but not with the statin-derived
 xxxg1209xxx  inhibitor, lfa703, which did not inhibit hmg-coa
reductase [10]. in the presence of 100 ng/ml il-18,
pravastatin, fluvastatin and lfa703 similarly inhibited the
expression of icam-1 and cd40 as well as the production
of il-12,  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g in pbmc. the effects of
pravastatin and fluvastatin but not lfa-703 were abolished
by the addition of mevalonate, indicating the involvement of
 xxxg1060xxx  in the action of pravastatin and
fluvastatin. simvastatin mimicked the effect of pravastatin
and fluvastatin, but not lfa-703, on the cytokine produc-

215

tion and adhesion molecules expression in the presence or
absence of il-18 (figs. 1a and 2a and [10]). mevalonate
abolished all the modulatory effects of simvastatin as well as
pravastatin and fluvastatin (figs. 1c, 1d, 2b and [10]).
whereas simvastatin is known as an  xxxg1060xxx 
[8] and  xxxg1209xxx  inhibitor [9], the effect of simvastatin might
depend on the inhibition of  xxxg1060xxx . moreover, in the presence of il-18, the inhibitory effect of
simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin and lfa703 on the
production of il-12,  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-g might depend on the
suppression of icam-1/ xxxg1209xxx  engagement. in conclusion,
we found that simvastatin induced il-18 production.
however, simvastatin inhibited the il-18-enhanced cytokine production and adhesion molecule expression. indeed,
it is still not known whether the effects are beneficial.
further study on simvastatin-initiated immune response
should be carried out.
