crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)

summary
the  xxxg2296xxx  1-34 of  xxxg1885xxx  (pth), administered intermittently,
results in increased bone formation in patients with osteoporosis. pth and a related molecule,
 xxxg1885xxx -related peptide ( xxxg1888xxx ), act on cells via a common pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor. in
order to define more precisely the ligand - receptor interactions, we have crystallized human pth (134) and determined the structure to 0.9 å resolution.  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) crystallizes as a slightly bent long
helical dimer. analysis reveals that the extended helical conformation of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) is the likely
bioactive conformation. we have developed molecular models for the interaction of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)

 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) and a hydrophobic interface with the receptor for the c-terminus of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) are
proposed.

introduction
 xxxg1885xxx  is an 84 amino acid polypeptide that regulates extracellular calcium
homeostasis via actions directly on kidney and bone and indirectly on intestine by facilitating
calcium absorption (1). once daily subcutaneous administration of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) stimulates bone
formation and increases bone mass in patients with osteoporosis (2) and ovariectomized monkeys
(3). thus,  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) has potential medical and pharmaceutical application to the treatment of
osteoporosis (4).
pth has both anabolic and catabolic effects on the skeleton. persistent elevation of pth
causes increased bone resorption, whereas intermittently administered pth results in enhanced bone
formation (5). the mechanism by which pth exhibits its dual effects is not known. pth interacts
with a g protein-coupled, seven transmembrane-helix receptor (pth/ xxxg1888xxx  or  xxxg1885xxx  receptor) to

and hpthrp (1-34) with the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor. a receptor binding pocket for the n-terminus of

crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)

stimulate adenylyl cyclase (6) and phospholipase c (7) activities. studies, both in vitro and in vivo,
have shown that the n-terminal 1-34 fragment has the same biological activities as the intact
hormone in eliciting camp responses and in stimulating bone formation (8). truncation and
mutagenesis studies on pth (1-34) have revealed that the n-terminal region is critical for activation
of receptor signaling, while the n-terminal truncated peptide pth (3-34) is only a partial agonist and
the further shortened peptide pth (7-34) becomes a low affinity antagonist (9, 10). residues 17 to
31, near the c-terminus of pth (1-34), are required for high affinity receptor binding (11).
 xxxg1888xxx  is a polypeptide that is over-expressed in certain tumors and causes the syndrome of

produced locally in a wide variety of tissues and is involved in cell growth, differentiation, and
development of the fetal skeleton. there are six identical amino acids in the first 13 amino acids in
the known pth and  xxxg1888xxx  sequences (fig. 1). like pth,  xxxg1888xxx  binds to the same g proteincoupled receptor, and its  xxxg2296xxx   xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) has many functions that mimic those of
full-length  xxxg1888xxx  (1-141) as well as pth (1-34) and full-length pth (1-84) (12, 13). in addition,
 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) and hpthrp (1-34) have similar three-dimensional structures based on nmr studies
(14, 15).
various methods have been used to determine the structure of pth, including dark-field
electron microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (cd) and nuclear magnetic
resonance (nmr) spectroscopy (14-23). results from these diverse approaches have not yet yielded
a consistent structure for this peptide. in part, this uncertainty arises from the flexible nature of small
peptides in solution, as well as, different experimental conditions such as protein concentration,
solvent conditions, ph, temperature and different method used for data interpretation. the general
consensus is that pth (1-34) and  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) have an n-terminal helix and a c-terminal helix,

which vary in length and stability depending on the specific experimental conditions, and are
connected by a highly flexible mid-region. the c-terminal helix is more stable than the n-terminal
helix. in aqueous solution, pth (1-34) and  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) form fewer and less stable secondary
structural elements than under membrane-mimicking conditions such as dodecylphosphocholine
micelles (20), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine vesicles (23), or in the presence of a secondary
structure-inducing solvent such as  xxxd3432xxx  (tfe) (18-20, 22, 23). several of the nmr
studies have been interpreted to show a “u-shaped” tertiary structure with the n- and c-terminal
helices interacting with each other to form a hydrophobic core (17, 18). however, the majority of the

two helices. to create more potent and orally available analogs of pth, detailed structural
information on the peptide should aid in characterizing the molecular interactions between the ligand
and receptor.

experimental procedures
peptide purification
human pth (1-34) (ly333334, eli lilly and company, indianapolis, in, u.s.a.) was
expressed in e. coli cells. the inclusion bodies were solubilized in 7 m urea and captured by a
reverse phase column (hp2mg).  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) was purified through a cation exchange-column
(pharmacia ffsp) with a gradient of 0.1-0.3 m  xxxd3213xxx  at ph 2.5 in 7 m urea, followed by a
reverse phase column (cg71) with a gradient of 22-32% acetonitrile in 20 mm glycine at ph 9 and
then refolded and freeze-dried.  xxxd3187xxx   xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) was synthesized on an abi-430a
peptide synthesizer using boc amino acids. the boc seleno- xxxd2595xxx  was prepared from lselenomethionine using di-t-butyldicarbonate. the  xxxd3187xxx   xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) was purified by

ammonium bicarbonate at ph 8 on a fplc system (pharmacia). identified fractions were pooled,
frozen and lyophilized. mass spectroscopy analysis showed complete incorporation of
 xxxd3187xxx  to the peptide.

crystallization and data collection
 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) was crystallized at 20°c by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. single

a solution containing 2.5 m ammonium sulfate, 5% isopropanol and 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, ph
4.5. crystals appeared overnight and continuously grew to 0.6 x 0.2 x 0.1 mm3 in a week. crystals of
 xxxd3187xxx   xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) were obtained by repeated seeding under the same conditions as
described above with 10 mg  xxxg1167xxx  of  xxxd3187xxx   xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) in 20% glycerol and 20 mm
sodium citrate, ph 4.5.
for cryogenic data collection,  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
x-ray data were collected at -170°c by a mar ccd detector at the imca (industrial macromolecule
crystallography association) beam line id-17 at advanced photon source (aps) in argonne
national laboratories. data were integrated and reduced using the program hkl2000 (24). the
crystals belong to haxagonal space group p65 with unit cell dimensions of a= 30.18 å and c=110.44
å. three data sets were collected for a  xxxd3187xxx   xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) crystal at wavelengths of
0.9795, 0.97936 and 0.9840 å for mad phasing (table 1).

the structure was solved by the program solve (25) with the mad data. the
polypeptide chain was fitted to the electron density with program o (26). the model was refined to
2.0 å resolution using the mad data, and to 0.9 å resolution using the native data in x-plor98
(27) by simulated annealing. the model was then further refined in shelx 97 (28) by the
conjugate-gradient algorithm with riding hydrogens. six-parameter anisotropic temperature factors
for all non-h atoms were included and after anisotropic refinement, the r factor fell from 20% to
14%, r-free fell from 22% to 17%. sequential model building processes were carried out in
quanta (molecular simulations, inc) against 2fo-fc and fo-fc maps. the final r factor for all data

molecular modeling
molecular modeling was carried out in quanta using the protein design tools. the
seven transmembrane domains of the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor were first determined by several
programs for transmembrane region detection provided by the expasy molecular biology server
(http://www.expasy.ch), then a consensus alignment was determined. the crystal structure of
bacteriorhodopsin at 1.9 å (pdb code, 1qhj, ref 29) was used as a template for the topological
orientation and arrangement of the tm helices. sequences of the transmembrane helices for the
pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor and bacteriorhodopsin were aligned, and then homology modeling was carried
out to create the tm helices of the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor. the conformations of the intracellular and
extracellular loops were constructed in quanta using the fragment database searching algorithm.
for the n-terminal receptor region 168-198, the nmr structure determined in a lipid environment
(30) (pdb code, 1bl1) was incorporated into the model. this was accomplished by aligning the

membrane embedded helix (residues 190-196) with the beginning of tm1. the final model of the
receptor contains residues 168-469 of the whole length, residues 1-593.
one  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) monomer, derived from the crystal structure, was docked into the receptor
using two constraints based on cross-linking studies (31, 32). energy minimization was applied to
the complex of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) and residues 168-198 of the receptor using default setting in quanta
until no significant changes were observed. the hpthrp (1-34) model was produced by homology
modeling using the crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) as a template. the model of hpthrp (1-34)
binding to the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor was created similarly to the  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)-receptor complex.

overall structure
the structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) was determined by the multiple wavelength anomalous
dispersion (mad) method using  xxxd3187xxx   xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) with the program solve (25). it
was then refined anisotropically to 0.9 å resolution against a native data set with the program
shelx97 (28) (fig. 2, table 1). inclusion of anisotropic motion for the b factor refinement
decreased the r factor significantly. the overall structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) is a slightly bent helix
(fig. 3a). the bend is located between residues 12 and 21 with a bending angle of 15° between the
n-terminal helix (residues 3-11) and the c-terminal helix (residues 21-33). hydrogen bonds between
the side chains of asn16 and glu19, ser17 and arg20, and salt bridge between glu22 and arg25 are
observed (fig. 3a). although  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) is a continuous helix, residues 6-20 and residues 21-33
form two amphiphilic helices with the hydrophobic sides of these helices facing in different
directions. thus, the hydrophobic residues of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) form a twisted belt from the n-terminus
to the c-terminus with the crossing-point near residue arg20 (fig. 3a). gly12 is a conserved residue

results and discussion

crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)

in all the known pth and  xxxg1888xxx  species (fig. 1). despite the flexible nature of glycine, gly12 is in
a strict helical conformation in the crystal structure. substitution of gly12 with alanine, a helix
promotor, in [tyr34] xxxd2847xxx (1-34)nh2 was well tolerated; while substitution with proline, a helix
breaker, decreased receptor binding affinity by 840 fold and adenylyl cyclase-stimulating activity by
3500 fold (33). together, these findings indicate that the helical conformation around gly12 is
essential for full biological activity.
 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) crystallizes as a dimer in the hexagonal space group p65. his14 and ser17 from

his14 from one molecule forms a hydrogen bond with ndelta of his14 from another molecule, while
ser17 from one molecule packs against the imidazole ring of his14 from the other molecule (fig. 3b,
3c). within the dimer interface, hydrophobic interactions extend from the crossing-point toward the
n- and c-termini. residues  xxxg234xxx , leu11 and leu15 of the n-terminal amphiphilic helix from one
molecule are in van de waals contact with residues leu24, val21 and met18 of the c-terminal
amphiphilic helix from the other molecule.
the main chain conformation of each molecule in the dimer is quite similar except for the
conformation of the n-terminal residue ser1 that deviates somewhat from its counterpart. thus, the
root mean square deviation is 0.05 å when the main chain atoms of residues 2-34 from two
molecules are superimposed and 0.09 å when all main chain atoms of residues 1-34 are used. the
side chains of several residues adopt different conformations in the different monomers. three
alternative conformations for ser17 and glu22 and two alternative conformations for ser3,  xxxg234xxx ,
his14, met18 and his32 are observed in each molecule. residues ile5, met8 have one conformation
in one molecule and two in the other. the side chain conformations of residues gln6, lys26 and
lys27 are not superimposible between the two molecules. because of these different conformations

both molecules are located at the crossing-point of the x-shaped dimer (fig. 3b and 3c). the ndelta of

and different water structures around the monomers,  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) crystallizes as a dimer in the
asymmetric unit in the space group p65 rather than a monomer in the higher symmetry space group
p6522. our results from ultracentrifugation studies with  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34), in a solution that was close to
crystallization conditions, did not demonstrate stable dimer formation, which is consistent with
previous ultracentrifugation results obtained from  xxxd2847xxx  (1-37) (17). thus, the dimer seen here is
most likely a lattice effect in crystal packing rather than being an intrinsic property of pth (1-34) in
solution.

extensive nmr studies have been carried out on pth and  xxxg1888xxx  in different solvent
environments (14). in general, nmr studies show that pth (1-34) and  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) form an nterminal helix and a c-terminal helix connected by a highly flexible region in solution. fig. 4 shows
the superposition of the crystal structure with nmr structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) with pdb code 1hpy
(34) by superimposing the calpha atoms of the c-terminal helices (residues 18-28). superposition of the
crystal structure with other nmr structures, such as  xxxd2847xxx  (1-37) (pdb code: 1hph) (17) and
hpthrp (1-34) (pdb code: 1bzg) (15) yielded similar pictures as fig. 4 (not shown). these nmr
structures were obtained under near physiological conditions. the highly flexible region in the nmr
structures (residues 10-20) is found to form a regular helix in our crystal structure. evidence from
several nmr studies on pth (1-34) and  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) concluded that the helical content increases
with increasing tfe concentration or conditions that mimic the membrane environment. in 70%
tfe, the n- and c-terminal helices (residues 3-13 and 15-29) of pth (1-34) were very regular with
a short discontinuity at residue 14 (35). nmr structures of  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) in 50% tfe also showed
two well-defined helices (residues 3-12 and 17-33) (14). our crystal structure is similar to the nmr

comparison of the crystal structure with nmr structures

structures determined in high concentrations of tfe or under membrane-mimicking conditions (14,
35). this similarity is not surprising because  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) in the crystal has very limited solvent
exposure. the solvent content of the  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) crystal is less than 30% with extensive
hydrophobic protein-protein interactions. in fact, the crystal structure might represent the
conformation of pth (1-34) when it is close to its membrane receptor as proposed for the nmr
structures under high concentrations of tfe or membrane-mimicking conditions (23).

bioactive conformations of pth (1-34) and  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34)

lactam cyclizations designed to stabilize secondary structural elements to probe for their presence.
lactam bridges were introduced at different locations along the peptide to connect the side chains at i
and i+4 positions in an effort to stabilize a helical conformation. structural and functional studies
have suggested that increasing helical content by such conformational constraints may increase
biological potency, but this result is highly sensitive to the constrained positions. condon, s.m. et.
al.1 reported that adenylyl cyclase stimulating activity in ros 17/2.8 cells was increased when a
lactam bridge was introduced between residues 14 and 18 or 18 and 22 of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-31), but
decreased when the lactam bridge was introduced between residues 10 and 14. in  xxxg1888xxx , when
lactamization was introduced between residues 13 and 17, adenylyl cyclase-stimulating activity was
also increased (36). however, a lactam bridge introduced between residues 26 and 30 resulted in 400
times lower binding affinity and 30 times lower adenylyl cyclase-stimulating activity (36).
interestingly, the lactam containing structures of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-31)2 and hpthrp (1-34) (36) were
both in extended helical conformations, very similar to our crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34). in the
crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34), the three well tolerated lactam bridges (residues 13-17, 14-18 and

18-22) are located on either the convex or concave sides of the arc formed by the slightly bent helix
and are in the mid region of the molecule (fig. 5). thus, it appears that enhancing helical structure in
this flexible region of the peptide increases the biological activity of pth and  xxxg1888xxx . the poorly
tolerated bridges (residues 10-14 and 26-30) are located on the sides of the  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) helical arc
(fig. 5). in these cases, the decreased biological activities may be caused by twisting the helical arc
sideways or interfering with the ligand-receptor interaction when lactam bridges were introduced at
those positions. thus, rigidity in the middle region of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34), as well as the bending direction
of the helix appears to have significant functional effects. therefore, the extended helical

conformation of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34).  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) could be in a flexible conformation in solution as would
occur in the extracellular space, but a regularized helical conformation is likely to be induced when
the peptide approaches the hydrophobic membrane before receptor binding. these hypotheses are
examined further by the following molecular modeling results.

model of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) binding to the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor
previous studies on pth- or  xxxg1888xxx -receptor interactions have suggested that the
juxtamembrane region of the transmembrane (tm) helices and extracellular loops (especially the
third loop) of the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor interact with the amino-terminus of pth or  xxxg1888xxx  agonists
to induce second messenger signaling (37); the amino-terminal extracellular region of the receptor
interacts with the carboxyl-terminal region (residues 15-34) of either pth or  xxxg1888xxx  during ligand
binding (11). results from photoaffinity cross-linking by p-benzoylphenylalanine and site-directed
mutagenesis identified two contact points in the pth (1-34)!pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor complex, ser1 of
 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) to met425 of the receptor (31) and lys13 of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) to arg186 of the receptor

conformation observed in the crystal structure may well represent the active receptor-binding

crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)

(32). a model of the  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) bound to the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor was created by incorporating
these restraints. our model of the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor was generated by homology modeling using
the 1.9 å resolution crystal structure of bacteriorhodopsin (pdb code, 1qhj) (29) as a template for
the seven transmembrane helices. the conformations of the intracellular and extracellular loops were
constructed by a fragment database searching algorithm. the nmr structure of the putative ligandbinding domain of the receptor (30), residues 168-196, was also incorporated.  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) was
docked to the receptor utilizing the previous knowledge on the ligand-receptor interaction and the
contact points identified by photoaffinity cross-linking and site-directed mutation studies (31, 32).

activity, binds to a pocket consisting of the extracellular portion of  xxxg2318xxx , tm4 and tm6 and the
second and third extracellular loops of the receptor. the middle region of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) is
sandwiched between the first extracellular loop and the n-terminal extracellular region of the
receptor adjacent to tm1. the c-terminal region of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) forms extensive interactions with
the putative binding domain of the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor (fig. 6b). this interface consists of the
hydrophobic interactions (residues leu24, trp23 and leu28 of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34), and phe173, leu174 of
the receptor); and hydrophilic interactions between arg20 of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) and glu180, glu177 of
the receptor, as well as lys27 of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) and glu169 of the receptor.
several models have been proposed in the literature for the binding of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) to the
pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor, utilizing the nmr structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) with n- and c-terminal helices
connected by a flexible loop. bisello a. et al (31) have suggested that the n-terminus of  xxxd2847xxx  (134) locates close to the extracellular end of tm6. in a recent model, the n-terminal helix of pth
locates within a space surrounded by the extracellular portion of the seven transmembrane helices
and extracellular loops, while the c-terminal helix of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) has two possible orientations

crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)

relative to the amino-terminal extracellular region of the receptor (38). using the crystal structure of
 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) with its extended helical conformation, only one orientation of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) in our
model satisfies all the known ligand-receptor contact restraints (fig. 6b).
site-directed mutagenesis studies in the c-terminal region of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) have suggested that
leu24 and leu28 are intolerant to mutation (39). when leu24 and leu28 are substituted by glu, the
receptor binding affinities decrease by 4000 and 1600 fold, respectively. a less dramatic reduction of
receptor binding affinity (40 fold) is observed when val31 is replaced by glu. in contrast,
replacement of asp30 by lys has no effect on receptor binding. in our model (fig. 6b), leu24 and

the end of the hydrophobic patch. asp30 is exposed to solvent, therefore, the lysine mutant at this
position would not change receptor binding affinity. the hydrophilic interaction between lys27 of
 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) and glu169 of the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor may be less important for binding than other
interactions because a variety of mutations were tolerated at lys27 (39). to confirm this model,
additional site-directed mutagenesis studies must be carried out on residues at the interface discussed
above.

model of hpthrp (1-34) binding to the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor
it has been proposed that  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) binds to the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor in the same fashion
as pth (1-34) (38). we have constructed a homology model of hpthrp (1-34) using the crystal
structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) and docked hpthrp (1-34) to the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor with the same
orientation as  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34). this was followed by energy minimization. residues arg20 and leu24
are conserved among all the known pth and  xxxg1888xxx  sequences, while residues 23, 28 and 31 are all

crystal structure of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34)

hydrophobic residues that are functionally conserved (fig. 1). residues arg20, phe23, leu24, ile28
and ile31 of hpthrp (1-34) form similar interaction with receptor (not shown) as the corresponding
residues of  xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) in fig. 6b. residue leu27 in hpthrp, which is lysine in  xxxd2847xxx , is included
in the extensive hydrophobic interface.
 xxxd2847xxx  and hpthrp (1-34) share eight identical amino acids in the region 1-13, but only three
identical amino acids in the region 14-34 (fig. 1). however, the c-termini of both peptides form
similar amphiphilic helices that are proposed to be responsible for high affinity receptor binding (22,
23). when residues 22-31 were substituted with a model amphiphilic sequence (ellekllekl) in

studies confirmed that rs-66271 exists in a helical conformation from residues 16 to 32 (41). our
models for the interaction of pth and  xxxg1888xxx  to the common pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor support the
hypothesis that the amphiphilic helices at the c-terminal regions of the pth and  xxxg1888xxx  (1-34) are
responsible for the proposed peptide-receptor recognition (22, 23).
a detailed structural analysis of pth or  xxxg1888xxx  bound to its common pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor
will be required to fully understand this ligand-receptor binding and signaling. the x-ray structure of
 xxxd2847xxx  (1-34) reported here, combined with the nmr structures and biochemical results has allowed
modeling of  xxxd2847xxx  and hpthrp interacting with the pth/ xxxg1888xxx  receptor. this has provided a new
conceptual starting point for unraveling the ligand-receptor recognition mechanism, and
consequently to guide structure-based design of novel pth analogs and mimics.
