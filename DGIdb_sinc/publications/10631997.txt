abstract
the possible role of the central b-domain ~residues 151–287! of streptokinase ~sk! was probed by site-specifically
altering two charged residues at a time to alanines in a region ~residues 230–290! previously identified by peptide
walking to play a key role in plasminogen ~pg! activation. these mutants were then screened for altered ability to
activate equimolar “partner” human pg, or altered interaction with substrate pg resulting in an overall compromised
capability for substrate pg processing. of the eight initial alanine-linker mutants of sk, one mutant, viz. skkk256,257aa
~sk-d1!, showed a roughly 20-fold reduction in pg activator activity in comparison to wild-type sk expressed in
escherichia coli ~nsk!. five other mutants were as active as nsk, with two @sk re248.249aa and sk ek281.282aa , referred
to as sk~c! and sk~h!, respectively# showing specific activities approximately one-half and two-thirds, respectively,
that of nsk. unlike sk~c! and sk~h!, however, sk~d1! showed an extended initial delay in the kinetics of pg
activation. these features were drastically accentuated when the charges on the two lys residues at positions 256 and
257 of nsk were reversed, to obtain skkk256.257ee @sk~d2!#. this mutant showed a pg activator activity approximately
10-fold less than that of sk~d1!. remarkably, inclusion of small amounts of human plasmin ~pn! in the pg activation
reactions of sk~d2! resulted in a dramatic, pn dose-dependent rejuvenation of its pg activation capability, indicating
that it required pre-existing pn to form a functional activator since it could not effect active site exposure in partner
pg on its own, a conclusion further confirmed by its inability to show a “burst” of  xxxd2821xxx  release in the presence
of equimolar human pg and p-nitrophenyl guanidino benzoate. the steady-state kinetic parameters for hpg activation
of its 1:1 complex with human pn revealed that although it could form a highly functional activator once “supplied”
with a mature active site, the km for pg was increased nearly eightfold in comparison to that of nsk-pn. sk mutants
carrying simultaneous two- and three-site charge-cluster alterations, viz., sk re248.249aa;ek281.282aa @sk~ch!#,
sk ek272.273aa;ek281.282aa @sk~fh!#, and sk re248.249aa;ek272.273aa;ek281.282aa @sk~cfh!#, showed additive0synergistic
influence of multiple charge-cluster mutations on hpg activation when compared to the respective “single-site”
mutants, with the “triple-site” mutant @sk~cfh!# showing absolutely no detectable hpg activation ability. nevertheless, like the other constructs, the double- and triple-charge cluster mutants retained a native like affinity for complexation with partner pg. their overall structure also, as judged by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, was closely similar
to that of nsk. these results provide the first experimental evidence for a direct assistance by the sk b-domain in the
docking and processing of substrate pg by the activator complex, a facet not readily evident probably because of the
flexibility of this domain in the recent x-ray crystal structure of the sk-plasmin light chain complex.

plasminogen activators such as streptokinase, tissue plasminogen
activator, and urokinase are widely used as thrombolytic agents for
the treatment of diverse circulatory disorders, including myocardial infarction ~isis-3, 1992!. however, unlike uk and tpa, which
are proteases, sk is enzymatically inert. it acts by first forming a
noncovalent, high-affinity complex with hpg. this complex is
then believed to undergo an intramolecular conformational change
that exposes the active site in the zymogen. the active site within
sk-hpg now becomes capable of acylation and can be titrated
by hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl p-guanidinobenzoate ~npgb! to
 xxxd2821xxx  as a sharp “burst” ~mcclintock & bell, 1971!, or
catalyze the processing of small-mw amidolytic substrates. this
enzymatically active, “virgin” complex also rapidly develops a
capability to catalyze the specific transformation of substrate molecules of hpg to  xxxg1074xxx  by cleavage at the arg561–val562 peptide
bond ~reviewed by castellino, 1981!. an understanding of the
structural processes involved in, first, the exposure of the active
site in the virgin sk-hpg complex, followed by its transformation
to a highly specific protease ~either “activated” sk-hpg, or skhpn! that, unlike free plasmin, displays a very high substrate
preference for hpg ~markus & werkheiser, 1964!, is crucial to the
design of improved sk-based thrombolytic agents ~marder, 1993!.
sk has been shown to be composed of three distinct domains,
designated a, b, and g separated by two coiled coils, and small
regions at the n- and c-termini of the protein with disordered,
flexible structures ~conejero-lara et al., 1996; parrado et al., 1996;
wang et al., 1998!. while the regions at the two ends are known to
be dispensable for the biological activity of sk, selective deletions
of a or g domains, or parts thereof, lead to drastic reduction in
hpg activation ability, signifying that all three domains are vital
for the functioning of the molecule ~malke et al., 1987; fay &
bokka, 1998!. however, the exact manner in which each domain
contributes toward the high rates of pg activation characteristic of
full-length sk remains to be clarified. although it has been demonstrated that the three domains retain significant amounts of their
original native-like structure when individually isolated, none displays significant hpg activator activity on its own ~parrado et al.,
1996!. in contrast to the absence of any appreciable hpg activator
activity in isolated domains, the characteristic high-affinity binding of sk with hpg is relatively well preserved in the b-domain,
and to a lesser degree, in fragments derived from the a-domain
~nihalani & sahni, 1995; reed et al., 1995; rodriguez et al., 1995;
conejero-lara et al., 1996, 1998; nihalani et al., 1998!. more
recently, using physico-chemical approaches, it has been elegantly
demonstrated that the b-domain contributes in a major way toward
the generation of the high-affinity interactions between sk and
hpg that lead to the formation of the equimolar activator complex
between the two proteins ~conejero-lara et al., 1998!. a relatively
small locus in the b-domain ~residues in and around 230–290,
termed the “core” region! has earlier been implicated in the interaction of the activator complex with substrate hpg through a
peptide walking approach ~nihalani et al., 1997!. therefore, the
exact role of this domain, particularly in terms of the loci0epitopes
that may be involved in interacting with hpg to translate the
primary event in sk-hpg interaction, namely the avid binding
between these two proteins to the catalytic, high efficiency conversion of substrate molecules of hpg to  xxxg1074xxx  by the activator
complex needs to be explored further.
despite the compelling biochemical evidence implicating the
b-domain in both activator complex formation and in the interaction of this complex with substrate hpg, the recent x-ray dif-

a. chaudhary et al.
fraction structure of the sk-plasmin light chain complex does not
reveal an overt structural involvement of this domain in activator
complex formation ~wang et al., 1998!. however, what is fairly
discernible is that sk and pg together ~i.e., the activator complex!
provide a perfect docking site for substrate pg to be positioned
optimally for processing by the active site. computer modeling
studies with substrate microplasminogen artificially docked onto
the sk-plasmin light chain complex, indeed, suggest several potential contacts between the substrate and the a- and b-domains of
the sk of the activator complex. this observation thus reinforces
a proposed model of sk action ~nihalani et al., 1998! similar to
the “protein co-factor assisted” mechanism recently forwarded to
explain the switch of the relatively nonspecific, trypsin-like substrate specificity of the plasmin active site into a highly specific
substrate preference upon association with sk ~esmon & mather,
1998!. in the present paper, using site-directed mutagenesis as a
tool, we present experimental evidence for an important role of the
b-domain in substrate docking and processing by the sk-plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! activator complex, and probably in zymogen activation
as well.

these flanking primers had wild-type sequences, carrying unique r.e. sites naturally present in the nsk gene, and were used to
dock back the mutant pcr cassettes into the sk expression vector ~see text for details!.

of primary structure of sk shows several positively and negatively
charged clustered residues. to delineate the possible role of these
side chains, site-specific mutations of eight such clustered charges
~two residues per site! to alanine residues were carried out using a
pcr-based “megaprimer” approach ~sarkar & sommer, 1990; smith
& klugman, 1997!. the mutated cassettes were then docked back
into the native sk gene in the expression plasmid, and the genes
expressed intracellularly in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity ~see table 1 for sequence of primers used for mutagenesis,
and materials and methods for details!. the native-like recombinant sk ~termed nsk! expressed in the heterologous host, after
purification, was found to exhibit several of the known characteristic features of native sk from s. equisimilis, e.g., a mw of
47 kd, native n-terminal sequence except for the presence of a
met residue at the n-terminus ~as expected from the gene sequence!, high-affinity binding with hpg, and a specific activity for
hpg activation of around 1.0 3 10 5 i.u. per mg protein. in case
of all the mutants constructed ~table 2!, these criteria were essentially found to be native like, except for reduction, to varying
extents, in the specific activities for hpg activation of selected
mutants. for simplification, the various sk mutants described in
this study have been abbreviated with different suffixes, e.g., sk~c!,
sk~d1!, etc. ~see table 2!. of all the eight initial alanine-linker
mutants, only one ~skkk256.257aa !, referred to as sk~d1!, showed
a major diminution in pg activation ability, to a level approximately 5% that of nsk. two other mutants, viz., skre248.249aa and
skek281.282aa , abbreviated as sk~c! and sk~h!, respectively,
showed relatively marginal decreases in specific activity for hpg
activation, while the remaining were found to be totally unaltered.
remarkably, all the mutants, including ones with lowered activity,
retained near-native hpg binding affinities as measured by a solid
phase radio-assay employing 125 i-labeled hpg.
the mutant sk~d1! displayed kinetics of hpg activation that
were distinctly different on a qualitative basis when compared to

the other mutants, viz. sk~c! and sk~h!, that had detectable
decrease in activity as well. in the case of sk~d1!, the kinetics of
pg activation ~fig. 2a! was noticeably slower, especially in the
initial phases. the progress curves generated with sk~d1! demonstrated a perceptible lag even when relatively high concentrations of the mutant were used in the assay, while nsk demonstrated
a clear-cut absence of such a lag even when assayed using low
amounts ~fig. 2a!. mutants sk~c! and sk~h! also showed the
absence of any lag. the overall specific activity of sk~d1! for
hpg activation ~computed from plots of change in absorbance at
405 nm vs. t 2 ; see materials and methods! was determined to be

skkk256.257aa were added to assay cuvette containing hpg and chromozyme pl, and the activator activity of the mutant was
monitored spectrophotometrically as detailed under materials and methods. the figure shows progress curves of hpg activation by
different amounts of sk~d1!, viz., 4.3 nm ~open triangles!, 6.4 nm ~closed circles!, 8.5 nm ~open squares!, 10.6 nm ~closed triangles!,
and 12.7 nm ~open circles!. a control hpg activation reaction with 0.5 nm e. coli–expressed, wild-type nsk ~closed squares! is also
depicted. b: generation of amidolytic activity in hpg by mutant sk~d1!. an equimolar mixture of either sk~d1! or nsk was
prepared with hpg ~5 mm each! and the amidolytic activity generated in hpg was monitored by periodically assaying in a cuvette
containing 1 mm chromozyme pl. the percentage of maximum amidolytic ability generated as a function of pre-incubation period
by either sk~d1!-hpg @open triangles# or nsk-hpg complexes @closed squares# is depicted. the maximum amidolysis generated by
nsk was taken as 100% to calculate the amidolytic activity.

barely one-twentieth as compared to nsk. the cause of this “latent” activation became apparent when the time course of amidolytic activation by equimolar quantities of sk~d1! and hpg was
examined ~fig. 2b!, which clearly showed significantly slow activation kinetics in case of sk~d1!, with appearance of full amidolytic ability requiring 25–30 min. on the other hand, nsk-hpg
equimolar mixtures generated amidolytic activity rapidly, with saturation being attained within 7–8 min after initiation of the reaction. the much slower amidolytic activation suggested that the
delayed substrate hpg activation kinetics observed with this mutant likely arose from a slower exposure0maturation of the plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! active site in the sk~d1!-hpg activator complex.
charge-reversal mutations at positions 256 and 257 in sk
drastically compromise the hpg activation as well as
amidolytic activation properties of the molecule
to further explore the role of the positively charged lysine residues
of native sk at positions 256 and 257, these were altered to negatively charged  xxxd2431xxx  residues by site-directed mutagenesis. the resultant mutant @skkk256.257ee , abbreviated sk~d2!#
was purified, and its hpg activation as well as amidolytic activation characteristics with equimolar partner hpg were examined.
the construct showed a highly diminished overall rate of hpg
activation ~fig. 3a!, which was determined to be ;500 i.u.0mg,
which is roughly 200-fold lower than that of nsk, and nearly 10
times lower than that of sk~d1!. in addition, the progress curves
of hpg activation generated with sk~d2! showed markedly prominent lag periods ~fig. 3a! when compared to that of sk~d1!
~fig. 2a!. also, unlike sk~d1!, sk~d2! showed much slower
amidolytic activation with 1:1 molar hpg ~less than 10% amidolytic activity as compared to nsk after 20 min; see fig. 3b!,
suggesting that the substitution of negatively charged side chains
at positions 256 and 257 of sk had adversely affected the proteins’

ability to rapidly form a stoichiometric complex with hpg, or
grossly undermined the ability of the complex, once formed, to
initiate active site exposure in “partner” hpg. however, the apparent affinity of sk~d2! for hpg, when determined by the solid
phase radioassay, was found to be virtually unaltered ~approximately 1.5-fold decrease compared to nsk; kd 5 1.8 nm!, indicating that its observed inability to activate equimolar zymogen
did not emanate from a correspondingly lowered affinity between
the complexing partners. the survival of the capability in sk~d2!
to bind hpg was confirmed by examining the binding of this
mutant with hpg-agarose, which clearly demonstrated that this
mutant could indeed bind with this affinity matrix in a manner that
was indistinguishable from that of nsk ~see fig. 4b!. these results
strongly indicated that the “biochemical lesion” in sk~d2! was
not an inability to stoichiometrically complex with hpg, but at the
post-complexation step of active site exposure in partner hpg. to
explore this further, we tested the ability of this mutant to give the
characteristic “burst” of  xxxd2821xxx  release with equimolar hpg
after reaction with the active site acylating agent, npgb ~chase &
shaw, 1969!. it is known that the sk-hpg virgin complex can
undergo acylation at the cryptic active site with this “pseudosubstrate” even before the conversion of the hpg to  xxxg1074xxx , while
hpg or sk, individually, are unreactive with the reagent ~mcclintock & bell, 1971; reddy & markus, 1972; wohl, 1984!. the
results ~see fig. 3b, inset! showed clearly that sk~d2! failed to
show any significant release of  xxxd2821xxx , while a characteristic burst was observed in case of nsk @as well as with sk~d1!#,
indicating that sk~d2! could not engender a npgb-reactive active center in equimolar hpg.
the presence of a distinct delay in the activation of partner
hpg2, on the one hand, and the presence of a highly diminished
hpg activator activity in sk~d2! prompted us to explore whether
this phenotypic deficiency could be overcome by providing a “preformed” active site in the form of  xxxg1074xxx . for this purpose, we added

hpg and chromozyme pl ~see materials and methods!. the figure shows the progress curves of hpg activation by different amounts

sk~d2! or nsk and hpg ~5 mm each! and periodically assaying for amidolysis as detailed under materials and methods and
figure 2b. the figure shows the percentage of maximum amidolytic ability generated as a function of pre-incubation times by either
sk~d2!-hpg ~open circles! or nsk-hpg complexes ~closed squares!. inset: active site titration of hpg on complexing with nsk,
sk~d1! or sk~d2! using npgb. the generation of an active centre in “partner” hpg by nsk, or mutants sk~d1! or sk~d2!, was
monitored for release of a burst of  xxxd2821xxx  as described under materials and methods. the figure depicts the progress curves of
npgb hydrolysis by nsk-hpg ~closed squares!, sk~d1!-hpg ~open triangles! or sk~d2!-hpg ~open circles! complexes and a
control reaction ~closed triangles! from which sk was omitted, and a corresponding volume of buffer was added to the reaction mixture
containing all other components. c: enhanced hpg activation by mutant sk~d2! in the presence of increasing amounts of  xxxg1074xxx . the
effects of increasing amounts of added  xxxg1074xxx  to the hpg activation ability of sk~d2! was studied by adding 1 nm sk~d2! to a reaction
mixture containing 1 mm chromozyme pl, 1 mm hpg and varying amounts of  xxxg1074xxx  ~prepared using immobilized urokinase!. the
figure shows the resultant activation curves when 1 nm  xxxg1074xxx  ~closed triangles!, 15 nm  xxxg1074xxx  ~open squares!, or 30 nm  xxxg1074xxx  ~filled

trace quantities of  xxxg1074xxx  into the pg activation reactions of sk~d2!
and then measured the rates of hpg activation using the spectrophotometric method ~fig. 3c!. the results demonstrated a remarkable rejuvenation of pg activator activity in the reactions as a
function of increasing  xxxg1074xxx . by contrast, when the activation reactions were carried out using hpg preparations whose intrinsic
 xxxg1074xxx  content was decreased by passage through soybean trypsin
inhibitor-agarose ~see materials and methods!, the activator activ-

ity was seen to be perceptibly decreased. these results clearly
indicated that a rate-limiting factor in the generation of activator
activity by sk~d2! was the conversion of the initial sk~d2!-hpg
complex to an enzymatically competent state possessing amidolytic and pg activation functions. this deduction was fully confirmed when sk~d2! was pre-incubated briefly with equimolar
 xxxg1074xxx , and the sk~d2!- xxxg1074xxx  complex assayed as before for activator activity in the presence of excess hpg ~1 mm!. in this case

fig. 4. hpg-binding ability of charge-cluster mutants of sk. a: the binding isotherms of mutants. either nsk or sk~cfh! was
immobilized onto the wells of a polyvinyl microtitre plate and probed with varying concentrations of 125 i-hpg. the total radioactive
counts bound onto each well were subtracted from the counts in the control wells ~in which no sk was immobilized!, and the data
plotted as a function of 125 i-hpg concentration. the figure shows representative data obtained for nsk ~closed squares! and sk~cfh!
~open circles!. the dissociation constants from such curves ~mean of at least three experiments were taken! were then calculated ~see
materials and methods!. b: binding of sk mutants onto hpg-agarose. affinity chromatography of either nsk ~a! or the triple
charge-cluster mutant, sk~cfh! ~b! was carried out on hpg-agarose columns and the specifically bound protein was eluted using 8 m
urea as described under materials and methods. the binding profile obtained with sk~cfh! ~shown above in b! was closely similar
to that obtained with sk~d2! ~data not shown!.

~fig. 3c!, a remarkably high activity was seen to be engendered.
however, we noticed that the specific activity of sk~d2! complexed with  xxxg1074xxx , although considerably resuscitated, was still
perceptibly less than that of nsk- xxxg1074xxx , indicating that this mutant,
despite being supplied with a fully formed active site, was still
catalytically less active than nsk under the experimental conditions. nevertheless, the foregoing results on the rejuvenation of
sk~d2! with  xxxg1074xxx  clearly showed that a principal “block” in the
action of sk~d2! was at the level of the formation of a functional
activator after complexation with equimolar hpg.
the steady-state kinetic parameters for the catalytic processing
of hpg and amidolytic peptide substrate by the equimolar complexes of sk~d1! and sk~d2! with  xxxg1074xxx  are presented in tables 3

and 4, respectively. it is evident from these data that both mutants
possess near-native ability for hpg processing under substratesaturating conditions after being “partnered” with  xxxg1074xxx . however,
the km values for substrate hpg in case of sk~d1! and sk~d2!
are approximately four- and eightfold higher, respectively, when
compared to nsk. it is worth mentioning here that the mutation of
two tandem lysine residues ~kk 272,273! situated close-by in the
beta domain, to alanine residues, had not resulted in any perceptible change in the biological activity of the resultant mutants ~see

beta-domain mediated streptokinase-plasminogen interactions
residues at positions 256 and 257 are specifically involved in the
interaction of the sk-plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! activator complex with substrate pg. to further examine this aspect i.e., whether the observed
effect on substrate-activator complex interactions was positionspecific, rather than that arising from reversing the charges of two
tandem residues in this segment of the primary structure of sk
leading to a general “charge-destabilization” of this segment, we
reversed the charges on two other such residues ~ee 262,263!
lying in the immediate vicinity of residues 256 and 257. the resultant mutant ~skee262.263kk ! was then examined for its functional properties after purification. the results ~data not shown!
revealed no perceptible alteration in the specific activity of its
hpg activator activity nor its ability to activate zymogen, suggesting strongly that the two lysine side chains at positions 256 and
257 were specifically involved in promoting the interaction of the
activator complex with substrate pg.
in contrast to an increased km for substrate pg, the km values of
the  xxxg1074xxx  complexes of sk~d1! and sk~d2! for the low-mw
amidolytic substrate ~chromozyme pl! were close to that of nsk,
and the turnover rates ~kcat values! were also similar, suggesting
that the basic characteristics of the  xxxg1074xxx  active site in terms of their
ability to catalyze the scission of specific peptides, upon complexation with sk~d1! and sk~d2!, were unchanged. it should be
mentioned here that one prominent and easily detectable consequence of the binding of sk with  xxxg1074xxx  is a roughly fivefold
elevation of its km for amidolytic substrates without a concomitant
alteration of the kcat values ~robbins et al., 1981!, which has been
interpreted to reflect a decreased accessibility of the substrate for
the active center in the plasmin moiety of the activator complex,
probably due to steric hindrance arising from sk binding in the
vicinity of the active site ~wohl, 1984!. the isolated sk b-domain
~fragment 143–293! also brings about a similar alteration in km
values of  xxxg1074xxx  for the amidolytic substrate, as reported earlier
~nihalani et al., 1997!. table 4 shows that both mutants, like nsk,
brought about the characteristic increase in the km for amidolytic
substrate over that of free  xxxg1074xxx . these results indicated that despite
the alteration at residues 257 and 257 the binding of the mutants
with  xxxg1074xxx  resulted in a native-like inhibition of the accessibility of
the amidolytic substrate for the active site.
the simultaneous introduction of multiple charge-cluster
to alanine mutation in the “core” region of the b-domain
destroys substrate processing and zymogen activation
properties without significantly affecting high-affinity
interactions of sk with partner pg
the single charge-cluster sites whose mutations had led to a detectable reduction in terms of specific activities for hpg activation in comparison to nsk, e.g., sk~c! and sk~h! ~see table 2!,
were then taken up for further mutagenic analysis by constructing
double charge-cluster sk mutants, viz., sk~ch! carrying four
simultaneous point mutations. another double-site charge-cluster
mutant was also constructed that included, besides site “h”, another charge-cluster mutation ~namely, that in sk~f!; see table 2!
that had a relatively innocuous effect on the pg activator activity
of sk. to explore a possible synergistic influence of these sites on
the activity of sk, a triple-site mutant, abbreviated sk~cfh!, was
also constructed ~see materials and methods for the experimental
strategy employed! that carried all three charge-cluster alterations
simultaneously. all of these mutants were then expressed intracellularly in e. coli, purified as before for single charge-cluster mu-

tants, and characterized with respect to their functional properties,
viz. amidolytic activation of equimolar hpg, as well as activation
of substrate hpg.
the steady-state kinetic parameters for pg activation and amidolysis for these constructs are shown in tables 5 and 6, respectively. for a complete analysis, the results for the two double- and
triple-site mutants are compared to nsk, on the one hand, and their
single-site counterparts, viz., sk~c!, sk~f!, and sk~h! on the
other. it is evident that the simultaneous presence of the three
charge-cluster mutations ~generating a hexa-mutant! virtually completely abolishes the amidolytic and plasminogenolytic capabilities
of the molecule, whereas the two-site charge-cluster mutants, viz.,
sk~ch! and sk~fh! displayed significantly reduced hpg activator activities compared to their respective single charge-cluster
“parents” ~roughly one-fourth as compared to nsk!. in contrast to
the triple-site mutant, the double-site mutants, namely sk~ch!
and sk~fh!, were able to effect amidolytic activation in “partner”
pg at rates slightly delayed as compared to that observed with nsk
~data not shown!. however, once full amidolytic activation had
occurred in the 1:1 complexes, the hpg activator activities engendered were indistinguishable from those of their equimolar complexes with  xxxg1074xxx  ~table 5!. however, as the kinetic data in table 5
demonstrate, the overall lowered hpg activator activity ~kcat ! of
the double-site mutants owed its origin to an inherently less efficient processivity of substrate hpg. in contrast to mutants sk~d1!
and sk~d2!, which had near-native vmax values for hpg processing but significantly enhanced km values, only marginal effects, at
best, were observed in the km for hpg activation in case of these
mutants, viz., sk~ch! and sk~fh!. in the case of sk~cfh!, this
parameter could not be determined because of its nonexisting activator activity even when a functional partner in the form of  xxxg1074xxx 
was provided to make a 1:1 molar complex, and this complex used
for pg activator assays. thus, a particularly notable feature of
these mutants, including the partially active double-site mutants,
was the absence of any rejuvenation of their hpg activation capabilities in the presence of equimolar pre-formed  xxxg1074xxx , clearly
indicating that the loss in their activities was not due to an inability
to effect active site exposure in partner hpg.
to examine if the diminished pg activator activity of sk~ch!
and sk~fh!, and the complete abolishment of hpg activator activity in sk~cfh!, arose from an intrinsic inability to bind with
hpg or a step subsequent to the formation of a 1:1 molar complex
with hpg, their binding behavior with the latter was studied by
solid phase radio-assay. the results showed that these mutants

could bind with hpg with a high affinity ~table 7; fig. 4a!, with
the dissociation constants of their 1:1 complexes with hpg continuing to be in the nanomolar range despite the double0triple site
mutations. in case of the triple-site mutant @sk~cfh!#, a relatively
modest ~approximately threefold! reduction in affinity for hpg
was evident. however, this diminution in binding affinity of this
mutant does not appear to be commensurate with the drastic reduction in its biological activity. it may be mentioned that the latter
was measured in the presence of hpg at concentrations several
orders of magnitude higher than the nanomolar range of the dissociation constant between sk and hpg. the survival of a nearnative avidity between sk~cfh! and hpg was also confirmed
when the binding characteristics of this mutant onto hpg-agarose
was studied, which showed that sk~cfh! could indeed bind tightly
with the affinity matrix in a manner indistinguishable from that of
nsk ~fig. 4b!. similar results were obtained for the double chargecluster mutants ~data not shown!. these observations indicated that
the mutations in the core region of the b-domain had led specifically to a reduction in the ability of these proteins to process
substrate molecules @and in case of sk~cfh! and sk~d2!, zymogen activation of partner hpg as well# without significantly altering their ability to bind tightly with hpg to form the initial 1:1
complex.

the double- and triple-site mutants were then assessed for their
amidolytic parameters to explore whether the reduced catalytic
efficiency of their  xxxg1074xxx  complexes for hpg substrate was reflected
in a similar change with respect to the small-mw amidolytic substrate as well ~table 6!, presumably due to alterations brought
about in the active site of  xxxg1074xxx . it was observed that, if anything,
the kcat for amidase activity had marginally increased as a result of
these mutations, indicating that the primary specificity of the  xxxg1074xxx 
active site was basically unaltered upon complexation with the
mutants. remarkably, however, these mutants lacked an ability to
effect an increase in the km of  xxxg1074xxx  for the amidolytic substrate, a
property that is characteristic of the binding of native sk with free
 xxxg1074xxx  ~robbins et al., 1981; wohl, 1984!. thus, it appears that
these mutants, although exhibiting near-native affinities for hpg
~table 7!, failed to engender the structural alteration~s! in partner
hpg that result in a reduced access of the small-mw peptide
substrate to the active site due to steric hindrance. interestingly, in
terms of this effect, the single-site charge cluster mutant, sk~c!,
was similar to the double- and triple-site charge cluster mutants,
whereas sk~f! and sk~h!, like nsk, increased the km of  xxxg1074xxx  for
amidolytic substrate
with a view to explore whether the altered functionalities of the
mutants were reflected in their folding characteristics, in particular
their secondary structural features, their far-uv cd spectra were
recorded. the spectrum for nsk was closely similar to the one
reported previously for this protein ~radek & castellino, 1989!.
the cd spectrum of sk~cfh! revealed ~fig. 5! a remarkable
similarity to that of the native protein, showing that the overall
folding of this mutant despite the triple charge-cluster mutations,
was essentially preserved. the spectra of sk~d2!, sk~ch!, and
sk~fh! were nearly identical to that of nsk ~data not shown!.

these results thus suggest the absence of grossly misfolded structures in the mutated sk derivatives. it should be mentioned, however, that the native-like cd spectra do not necessarily rule out the
presence of conformational alterations in the vicinity of the mutations since the spectral contributions arising from these changes
could easily have been “averaged out” by the spectral contributions emanating from the remainder of the molecule.
discussion
perhaps the most intriguing question associated with the mode of
action of pg activators in general, and the sk-plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! activator complex in particular, is the structural basis of their inordinately high substrate specificity. in the case of the latter, the
identification of the mechanism~s! underlying the conversion of
the relatively nonspecific, trypsin-like substrate specificity of plasmin to that of a highly pg-specific protease upon complexing with
sk still constitutes a challenge despite the recent availability of the
three-dimensional structure of the sk-human plasmin light chain
complex ~wang et al., 1998!. conceptually, sk could produce a
change in the specificity of the plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! active site by changing its conformation0geometry per se, or by providing altered
secondary substrate binding subsites ~s2, s3, etc.! into the active
center, or by improving substrate presentation, through a more
optimal docking, of pg at the active site. it is also possible that
more than one of the above possibilities is operative together in the
functioning of sk. at present there is no direct evidence for the
first two possibilities. however, the structure of the sk-plasmin
light chain complex strongly supports the third possibility, which
we had also advanced earlier on the basis of biochemical studies
~nihalani et al., 1998!, that sk “switches” the substrate specificity
of plasmin because the sk-plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! complex provides two
substrate-specific sites for the optimal binding of substrate pg
onto the complex. indeed, modeling studies using the crystal structure data on the sk- xxxg1074xxx  light chain complex ~fig. 6! indicate
several potential contacts in the a- and b-domains of sk between
docked substrate and the complex and that the sk-hpg interface
provides a “near perfect” concavity for substrate positioning wherein
the scissile peptide bond in the latter becomes ideally amenable to

fig. 6. stereo view of the sk- xxxg1074xxx  light chain complex. the view is
shown as a c a trace. the b-domain of sk is seen to make relatively few
contacts with  xxxg1074xxx . the distance shown is that between the c a atom of
residue 260 of sk and the c a atom of arg561 of the cleaved  xxxg1074xxx . since
this distance is in excess of 50 å, it is unlikely that, at least in this structure,
lys256,257 will be close to the cleavage site unless large conformational
changes in the b-domain take place ~adapted from wang et al., 1998!.

2799
cleavage by the active center of the activator complex ~esmon &
mather, 1998; wang et al., 1998!. in the present study, a direct
experimental evidence of the involvement of the b-domain in such
a “protein cofactor mediated” catalytic assistance and substrate
docking mechanism for sk action is being reported.
our mutagenesis studies show that the replacement of the two
tandem lys residues at positions 256 and 257 in the core region
with either ala or glu residues drastically affects the hpg activation properties of the molecule. the involvement of these residues in sk functioning has been shown in an earlier study as well
~lin et al., 1996!. in that study, the lys residues were altered to ala
residues, and a decrease in hpg activation kinetics by the mutant
was noted. however, in the present investigation, by mutating the
lysyl to glutamyl side chains, a structurally much more nonconservative alteration, greater insight into the structure-function interrelationship of residues 256 and 257 could be obtained. the presence
of two consecutive negative charges at this locus turned out to be
highly detrimental to the functioning of the molecule, which now
showed a very low overall hpg activation capability even though
its apparent affinity for hpg to form a 1:1 complex was largely
unaffected. the slow activation kinetics of hpg by this mutant
was attributable to a highly compromised ability for effecting zymogen activation in partner hpg. in the case of the relatively less
drastic mutation kk256.257aa @sk~d1!#, the property of zymogen activation was slowed to a great extent compared to the native
protein. the underlying “biochemical lesion” that was caused by
mutation at lys256 and lys257 in sk, therefore, seemed to be
related to the first step~s! after complexation with hpg that lead to
the exposure of the active site in the latter. therefore, when the
charges of the two residues were reversed @as in sk~d2!#, there
was a highly enhanced delay in exposure of the active site in
partner hpg .
in the case of native sk, the nascent 1:1 sk-hpg complex is
believed to undergo a rapid conformational change to an “activated” form that displays both amidolytic and esterolytic capability
even before any proteolytic cleavage has taken place through a
process that is presently unclear ~esmon & mather, 1998!. it also
remains unclear whether it is this “virgin” complex, or the skhpn complex ~to which it rapidly converts!, that possesses the
earliest pg activator ability ~davidson et al., 1990; shi et al.,
1993!. whatever the exact mechanism of this zymogen activation
in the sk-hpg complex, our results show that the complex between sk~d2! and hpg is drastically compromised with respect
to this transformation, as indicated by an inability to participate in
the “npgb burst” reaction and an enhanced delay in amidolytic
activation of partner hpg. however, the 1:1 complex of sk~d1!
with hpg was able to react with npgb and also generate amidolytic activity albeit slowly ~figs. 2, 3!. thus, the rate-limiting
factor in the hpg activation process by these two mutants seems
to be a delay, to varying extents, in the generation of an amidolytically competent sk-plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! complex. indeed, in perfect
accord with this proposed scenario, the apparent hpg activation
capability of both mutants increased dramatically once a “fully
mature” partner, in the form of  xxxg1074xxx , was provided. the kinetic
analyses of the now “rejuvenated” activator complexes ~formed
with  xxxg1074xxx  instead of hpg! revealed, however, that their interaction
with substrate hpg was significantly reduced, as indicated by a
nearly fourfold increased km for hpg in the case of sk~d1!, and
a eightfold increased km in the case of sk~d2!.
our results on the involvement of lys256 and lys257 of sk in
substrate recognition represent the first experimental demonstra-

2800
tion of the direct involvement of the b-domain in providing assistance in the sequestering of substrate pg for processing by the
activator complex. these findings provide, at least in part, a rationale for the observation that consequent to sk binding, the km
of the  xxxg1074xxx  active site that is measurable in the millimolar range
for unconstrained, small-mw substrates is found to be several
orders of magnitude lower when tested against hpg as substrate
~robbins et al., 1981!. the complementary loci in substrate pg
with which the side chains of residues 256 and 257 make contact
in this process of increasing the efficacy of enzyme-substrate interactions, however, are presently unclear. the kringle domains of
hpg, due to the presence of lysine binding property in these
structures, immediately offer themselves as probable candidates,
especially since these have been implicated clearly both in 1:1
interaction between sk and hpg as well as in the interaction of
the activator complex with substrate hpg ~shi & wu, 1988;
conejero-lara et al., 1998; wang et al., 1998; young et al., 1998!.
however, precise structural information on this important aspect is
sorely lacking at present, particularly as the recently published
x-ray diffraction data employed crystals of complexes between
sk and  xxxd2767xxx , which is devoid of the kringle domains
~wang et al., 1998!. our results, nevertheless, point unmistakably
to a direct role of this region, in particular of the two lysine
residues at position 256 and 257, probably in the docking of substrate pg during its conversion to product ~plasmin! as a result of
the highly specific proteolytic cleavage at the scissile peptide bond
by the sk-plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx ! activator complex. the observation that
alterations in these residues lead to an apparent decreased substrate
affinity is entirely in keeping with this inference, even though the
identity of the complementary site~s! in substrate pg with which
these residues interact is presently unclear. in addition, these residues seem to be important in the zymogen activation process as
well. the molecular details of the process whereby sk binding to
pg leads to active site exposure even before any proteolytic scission has taken place has not been elucidated. wang et al. ~1998!
hypothesize that lys698 of hpg, which is located close to the
activation pocket, can replace the a-amino group of val562 ~hence,
forming the critical salt bridge to asp740 during the zymogen
activation process! in the sk-hpg virgin complex. a mechanism
such as this, or alternate ones ~esmon & mather, 1998; khan &
james, 1998!, presume an underlying conformational change in the
activation pocket of hpg subsequent to sk binding that activates
the hitherto latent active site without scissile peptide bond cleavage. it appears that the placement of two negative charges at 256
and 257 of sk strongly hinders this conformational change. at the
same time, the fact that the substitution of alanines instead of
 xxxd2431xxx  residues at these positions had a much milder effect
on the zymogen activation ability of the molecule suggests that the
two lys residues in nsk are not involved in zymogen activation
per se, since had it been otherwise, then irrespective of the type of
mutation, the effect would have been a drastic decrease in zymogen activation ability. wang et al. ~1998! suggest that the binding
of the g-domain of sk to the autolysis loop region of hpg may
cause the conformational change necessary to form a salt linkage
between the asp740 and lys698 of hpg. an inspection of the
recently elucidated three-dimensional structure of the sk- xxxg1074xxx 
light chain complex ~fig. 6! shows that residues 256 and 257 occur
in a highly flexible region of the b-domain. this region is encompassed by a long loop ~residues 248–259!, which was not observable clearly in the experimental electron density map due to
positional disorder. moreover, the b-domain itself exhibits high

a. chaudhary et al.
mobility as evidenced by its large thermal factors probably due to
the absence of the kringles ~wang et al., 1998!. in the sk- xxxg1074xxx 
light chain crystal structure, the tip of the disordered loop encompassing residues 256–257 in the b-domain is more than 50 å away
from the arg561 of the partner  xxxd2767xxx  ~see fig. 6!. thus,
unless one invokes the possibility that the b-domain’s juxtaposition with the rest of the activator complex is actually different in
the full-fledged ternary complex, viz., hpg.sk.hpg, occupying
either a position more proximal to the active site area or indirectly
influencing the conformational changes leading to active site exposure, it is difficult to make more definitive deductions at this
juncture regarding the structural basis of lys256,257 in activating
partner hpg.
unlike the crystal structure of the sk-plasmin light chain complex, the x-ray diffraction data on the closely similar pg activator
protein, staphylokinase ~sak! complexed simultaneously with substrate and partner hpg ~both in the form of the  xxxg1074xxx  light chain!,
appears to provide a better glimpse of the positioning of the substrate with respect to the plasmin active site. interestingly, sak
displays a marked structural similarity to the a-domain of sk
~wang et al., 1998!. besides this structural similarity, both sk and
sak have common functional similarities as well, in that both are
intrinsically inert bacterial proteins that activate pg “indirectly”
by first forming proteolytically functional activator complexes with
partner plasmin~ xxxd2046xxx !. however, unlike sk, sak requires a preformed active site to generate a functional activator, whereas sk
can expose the active site in partner zymogen directly ~collen
et al., 1993!. the lack of a zymogen activation ability in sak
seems to be commensurate with its smaller size ~approximately
one-third of sk! since it lacks the counterparts to the b- and
g-domains that sk possesses. besides the additional attribute of
autocatalytic zymogen activation, the presence of all three domains
in sk confers a catalytic advantage onto this activator protein over
sak, which is exemplified by the fact that the sk- xxxg1074xxx  complex
possesses a substrate hpg turnover rate that is significantly higher
than that of sak- xxxg1074xxx  ~robbins et al., 1981; radek et al., 1993!.
the present study suggests that at least a major part of this additional “catalytic power” emanates from the crucial assistance in
substrate binding and0or docking that the b-domain provides, and
which probably plays a crucial role in enhancing overall substrate
processivity as well. the crystal structure of the sak-plasmin
light chain complexed with substrate  xxxd2767xxx  ~parry et al.,
1998! strongly suggests substrate docking, on the one hand, and
subtle alterations of the secondary s30s4 subsites of the active
center of plasmin by the bound sak, on the other, as being responsible for the switch in the substrate specificity of the bound
 xxxg1074xxx . if one assumes that the a-domain of sk retains a high level
of functional analogy with sak, it should not seem surprising that
the intrinsic catalytic power of sak is much less than that of sk
because it has to generate this activity entirely on its own while in
the case of sk, both the a- and b-domains ~and probably the
g-domain as well! interact together to engender much higher rates
of hpg activation. our results demonstrate that at least one of the
major factors behind the contribution of the b-domain toward the
higher catalytic efficiency observed with sk- xxxg1074xxx  arises directly
from the locus encompassing the residues 256 and 257, since
alterations of these residues led to a perceptible increase in km for
substrate pg.
on the other hand, mutants altered simultaneously at several
residues around this site @as in case of sk~ch! and sk~fh!#

partner. these mutants, including sk~cfh!, appeared to be native
like by cd spectral analysis and showed dissociation constants for
hpg that, like that of nsk, were in the nanomolar range of concentration. at first sight, the most straightforward explanation for
this phenomenon is that the charges in this segment interact directly with residues involved in catalysis. however, this possibility
appears somewhat remote since the kcat values for amidolysis of
1:1 complexes of the mutants with  xxxg1074xxx  were not decreased, indicating an essentially unaltered active site topology. thus, as previously discussed, a rational explanation of the lowered kcat values
obtained with mutants sk~ch! and sk~fh! in the absence of any
perceptible changes in km values cannot be forwarded at this juncture and will probably have to await the availability of future
crystallographic data ~such as that gleaned from hpg.sk.hpg
ternary complexes! offering much greater structural detail than the
one presently available. the b-domain in this structure has demonstrably increased average thermal factor probably due to its enhanced mobility arising from an absence of stabilizing interactions
that are likely kringle-mediated. nevertheless, despite the absence
of a directly verifiable structural explanation, it is tempting to
speculate on possible alternate mechanisms that may help explain
the observed results. thus, one can envision a scenario of a proteincofactor mediated catalysis wherein both substrate docking and
product release are assisted through selective interaction of the sk
of the activator complex with discrete structural elements, such as
the kringles, in the substrate pg. the cardinal role played by the
kringle domains of pg in substrate recognition by the activator
complex is evident from the observed decrease in microplasminogen activation, which is devoid of kringles, by sk ~shi & wu,
1988; shi et al., 1990!, and also by the significant fall in the
formation of ternary complex ~hpg.sk.hpg! in the presence of
 xxxd146xxx  ~young et al., 1998!, an agent that binds to
kringles and alters their conformational states. it is well recognized
that the scission of the arg561–val562 peptide bond of hpg to
 xxxg1074xxx  generates a large conformational change in the latter, particularly in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of the kringle
domains ~mangel et al., 1990; marshall et al., 1994; bock et al.,
1996!. thus, in this model, kringle-mediated recognition of the
substrate by the core region of the b-domain of the sk in the
activator complex would enhance enzyme-substrate collision and
docking, and following conversion of substrate hpg to  xxxg1074xxx , the
facilitated release of the product ~plasmin! as well. the latter event
would accrue directly as a result of reduced affinity of the activator
for  xxxg1074xxx  consequent to conformational changes not only at the
active site but also in and around the interacting kringle~s! as well.
thus, sk might serve to enhance the affinity of substrate-activator
complex interactions by “exploiting” elements of the substrate
molecule that are destined to undergo the most prominent conformational changes upon conversion to product ~e.g., the scissile
peptide bond region itself and the kringle domain conformations!
so that the product can be released readily from the activator
complex upon completion of catalysis. kringle 5 is closest to the
scissile peptide bond region and therefore a likely candidate mediating this interaction. the fact that the two- and three-site chargecluster mutants have impaired ability, unlike nsk, to effect the
characteristic increase in the km for the amidolytic substrate in

their 1:1 complexes with  xxxg1074xxx  signifies an altered mode of binding
of their b-domain in the vicinity of the active site, which might be
responsible not only for an improper positioning of substrate pg,
but also in failing to recognize, to varying extents, the kringlemediated structural changes that help in product release. in case of
sk~cfh!, the impairment was not only at the level of hpg processing but in terms of zymogen activation as well, indicating that
the triple-site charge-cluster mutations had resulted in a relatively
greater structural destabilization in this segment of the b-domain.
indeed, the nearly two- to threefold decreased affinity of complex
formation observed with these mutants may signify a subtly altered
mode of interaction with partner hpg due to local structural disturbances, which might affect the catalytic properties of the complex without a concomitantly drastic decrease in the ability to form
the stoichiometric activator complex. thus, on the whole, the present
experimental observations suggest that the b-domain of sk is
involved in both the docking of substrate pg and its release as
product.
it is intriguing that despite the six simultaneous point-mutations
in sk~cfh!, its 1:1, high-affinity interaction with hpg was unchanged, and its overall structure, as evidenced by cd, retained a
native-like folding. at first sight, this might appear to be at variance with our earlier conclusions, based on a peptide walking
approach ~nihalani et al., 1997!, that this locus, besides participating in substrate recognition, is intimately involved in 1:1 interaction between sk and hpg. in that study, partially overlapping
peptides derived from the sequence 230–290 of sk were found to
inhibit strongly the formation of a functional activator complex
when added prior to complexation between equimolar sk and
hpg. conversely, peptides derived from the other regions of the
b-domain primary structure failed to show this effect. although the
present study substantially validates our earlier conclusion that a
substrate-specific binding locus is present in the region in and
around residues 250–270 of sk, an overt effect of the mutations in
the 230–290 region on 1:1 interactions between sk and hpg was
not detected. however, it is conceivable that intermolecular contacts other than those involving charged side chains are responsible
for this high-affinity interaction. indeed, a few distinct patches of
clustered  xxxd1850xxx  residues are present in the core region of the
b-domain of sk, that are potentially capable of providing intermolecular hydrophobic contacts with similar residues in hpg. we
have recently observed that alanine linker mutagenesis of these
patches results in a drastic reduction in the activity of the mutants
~a. chaudhary & g. sahni, unpubl. results!. the detailed functional effects of alterations, such as these or of other potential
contacts between sk and hpg as revealed by the recently published x-ray diffraction data, are currently being investigated in
detail. it is hoped that the availability of sk mutants specifically
altered in terms of their 1:1 interaction with hpg, or with respect
to substrate and0or product affinity, or turnover rates, followed by
their high-resolution structural evaluation will pave the way for a
clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism of sk action.

were of the highest analytical grade available.
design and construction of sk mutants
the cloning of the sk gene of s. equisimilis strain h46 a in e. coli
was carried out essentially by the approach of malke and ferretti
~1984!, and the details regarding the construction of expression
vectors have been described previously ~pratap et al., 1996; nihalani et al., 1998!. the different sk mutants were constructed by
a pcr-based strategy, using the “megaprimer” method of oligonucleotide directed site-directed mutagenesis using one mutagenic
and two ~common! flanking primers ~sarkar & sommer, 1990;
smith & klugman, 1997! followed by cloning into plasmid vectors
by standard methodologies ~sambrook et al., 1989!. the sequences
of the mutagenic primers used for the mutagenesis experiments are
depicted in table 1. the primers were designed to be complementary to the known dna sequence of the sk gene from s. equisimilis ~malke et al., 1985!. a total of 13 sk mutants, of three
distinct types were made viz., single-, double-, and triple-charge

a. chaudhary et al.
cluster sites ~see fig. 1! mutated either to ala residues ~in most
cases! or, in a few instances, to a complementary side-chain to
effect charge-reversal ~e.g., lys to glu, and vice-versa!, with each
mutant type representing the incorporation of two, four, or six
simultaneous point mutations, respectively. in table 1 are also
shown the diagnostic r.e. sites introduced by translationally silent
mutagenesis ~raghava & sahni, 1994! in each primer to aid the
screening of the clones. the sequence of the two flanking primers
~termed the “upstream” and “downstream” primers! in the amplification reaction are also shown. each of these carried an internal
r.e. site unique to the sk orf @as also to the plasmid pet23~d!sk#, viz., bser i and bsm i to facilitate the re-ligation of the
mutant pcr blocks back into the sk orf in the expression vector.
briefly, the first pcrs ~to generate the different mutant megaprimers! were carried out in a volume of 100 ml and contained ~final
reaction conditions are given! 200 mm dntps, 100 ng of template
dna @pet23~d!-sk, the t7 polymerase based expression vector
in which the full-length sk gene had been cloned; see nihalani
et al., 1998 and references cited therein#, 20 pmol each of the
mutagenic and downstream primers, 2.5 u of standard cloned pfu
thermostable dna polymerase, and 10 ml of 10x pfu reaction
buffer. the pcr cycling conditions were in accordance with the
denaturation temperatures of different primers, calculated using
the computer program, oligo ~version 4.0!. in general, all reactions
were started with a “hot start” ~94 8c, 5 min!, followed by a
denaturation ~94 8c for 45 s!, annealing ~50 8c for 1 min! and
extension ~72 8c, 1 min! phases. after a total of 30 cycles, a 10 min
period at 72 8c was given for a final extension of partially finished
daughter dna molecules, and the reactions were terminated, and
then processed through qiagen pcr purification columns. the
relevant dna cassettes were then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, by excising the required dna band and further purifying
by qiagen gel extraction kit. the amplified dnas was then used
as megaprimers for a second pcr ~referred to as pcr-ii! either
with wild-type sk gene as the template, or with full-length extended pcr products carrying different mutations as the template
to generate double- and triple-charge cluster mutant dnas ~see
below!. the full-length, extended dna cassettes were then cloned
back into pet23~d!-sk expression vector vector at the bseri and
bsm i sites. the pcr-ii pre-mixes ~100 ml! contained: 60 ng
template @pet23~d!-sk#, 200 mm dntps, 10 ml of 10x pfu buffer,
and varying concentrations of megaprimers ~200– 600 ng!. the
mixes were held for 5 min at 95 8c ~“hot start”! and the reaction
initiated with addition of 5.0 u of pfu dna polymerase per reaction. this was followed by seven cycles of denaturation ~94 8c,
45 s! and extension ~72 8c for 3 min! to ensure build-up of mutated
strand dna and to effect megaprimer extension. at the end of this
phase of the pcr, 20 pmol of upstream primer was added, and
thermal cycling continued as follows, for 10 cycles: 94 8c for 45 s,
51 8c for 1 min, and 72 8c for 1 min. after the last cycle, 20 pmol
of downstream primer was added, and cycling continued as before
for 15 cycles, followed by a final extension at 72 8c for 10 min.
the extended pcr products ~504 bp! were then purified on agarose gels and the dna bands isolated after excision of gel blocks.
these were digested with bseri and bsmi restriction enzymes and
ligated with similarly digested pet23~d!-sk plasmid dna, and
transformed into e. coli xl-blue electrocompetent cells. the desired clones were selected by screening mini-prep plasmid dnas
for the diagnostic r.e. sites incorporated through the pcr primers
~table 1!, and the positive clones were subjected to automated
dna sequencing to confirm the incorporation of the desired mu-

tation, as also to rule out the presence of any unwanted mutations
due to the pcr amplification. for the construction of double and
triple charge-cluster mutants, the same overall strategy was followed except that complementary megaprimers and templates were
used for the extension step in the pcr-ii step e.g., for the construction of the double charge-cluster mutant skre248.248aa;ek281.282aa ,
the megaprimer carrying the mutations re248.248aa was used
with the full-length extended pcr product carrying the mutations
ek281.282aa. similarly, for the construction of the double chargecluster mutant skek272.273aa; ek281.282aa , the extended pcr product containing the mutations ek281.282aa was employed as the
template, with the megaprimer carrying the mutations ek272.273aa
used to prime the reaction at the pcr-ii step. in case of the triple
charge-cluster mutant viz., sk re248.248aa;ek272.273aa;ek281.282aa , the
construction strategy was as follows. first, a megaprimer containing the double charge-cluster mutations ek272.273aa and
ek281.282aa was constructed using as template the purified pcr
product carrying the single cluster mutant ek281.282aa, and carrying out another pcr using the upstream primer bearing the
ek272.273aa mutation along with the downstream bsmi-site containing primer. this double charge-cluster megaprimer was then
isolated, and used along with the full-length extended pcr product
with the mutation re248.248aa ~used as template in pcr-ii!, to
generate pcr amplified dna block containing three simultaneous
charge-cluster mutations. all the purified mutant pcr dnas were
then digested with bse ri and bsm i restriction enzymes, and
cloned into similarly digested plasmid vector pet23~d!-sk to obtain the desired mutant sk clones. all mutations were confirmed
by dna sequencing of the complete sk gene in the expression
vector using the t7 promoter and terminator sequencer primers.
this also established the absence of any unwanted mutation introduced in the sk gene during mutant construction particularly as a
result of the pcr amplification.
expression and purification of sk mutants
the native-like recombinant sk ~termed nsk! or the various sk
mutants were expressed intracellularly in e. coli bl-21 ~de 3!
cells after induction with 1 mm iptg after initial growth until
mid-log phase, essentially as described ~nihalani et al., 1998!. the
bacterial pellets obtained by centrifugation from 1 l shake flask
cultures were suspended in 80 ml of 20 mm napo 4 buffer, ph 7.2,
and subjected to ultrasonication for 10 min with 30-s pulses with
equal periods of rest, using a heat systems ~new york, new york!
ultrasonic processer with a medium-sized probe. the lysates were
then processed for hydrophobic interaction chromatography ~hic!
on phenyl-agarose ~affinity chromatography ltd., isle of man,
u.k.! as follows. after centrifugation at 4 8c at 12,000 3 g for
15 min, the supernatants were made 0.5 m in nacl, and loaded
onto a column of phenyl-agarose ~2 3 10 cm! in equilibrating
buffer, viz., 0.5 m nacl in 20 mm napo4 buffer, ph 7.2. the
column was then washed successively with five bed-volumes each
of ~in this order!: equilibrating buffer, 20 mm na-po4 buffer,
ph 7.2, distilled water, and finally, 8 m urea. nearly 90% of the
loaded sk activity was recovered by elution with water, and the
protein found to be more than 80% pure as judged by sds-page.
this fraction, pooled conservatively, was then loaded onto a perseptive biosystem poros-d anion-exchange column ~1 3 5 cm! in
20 mm napo4 , ph 7.2, on a bio-cad sprint liquid chromatography work station. the chromatographic elution was carried out ~at
a flow rate of 1 ml0min! using a linear gradient of nacl ~0 to

1.0 m! in napo4 buffer, ph 7.2 over 20 min. greater than 75%
yield of sk activity, as compared to the preceding step, was obtained, and the sk eluted in and around a molarity of 0.3 nacl in
the gradient. the sk was more than 95% pure at this stage. the
major sk-containing fractions were pooled and stored at 270 8c
until analyzed. overall recoveries were consistently 50– 65%, yielding between 30– 40 mg purified protein0liter of shake-flask grown
culture. the purified proteins were subjected to n-terminal sequencing, which showed an extra methionine residue at the
n-termini, succeeded by the native sequence of sk.
characterization of sk mutants
assays for studying the activation of
hpg by sk and sk mutants
a one-stage assay method was used to measure the kinetics of
hpg activation by sk or its mutants ~wohl et al., 1980; shi et al.,
1994!. purified sk or mutant sk ~0.5–50 nm! were added to a
100 ml quartz assay cuvette containing hpg ~1 mm! in assay
buffer ~50 mm tris-cl buffer, ph 7.5! containing 1.0 mm chromogenic substrate ~boehringer-mannheim!. the change in absorbance at 405 nm was then measured as a function of time~t! in a
shimadzu uv-160 model spectrophotometer at 22 8c. appropriate
dilutions of standard w.h.o. s. equisimilis streptokinase were used
as reference for calibration of international units0mg protein ~specific activity! in the unknown preparations ~heath & gaffney,
1990!. the activator activities were obtained from the slopes of
the activation progress curves, which were plotted as change in
absorbance0t against t ~wohl et al., 1980!.
amidolytic and esterolytic activation of
equimolar sk0sk mutant-hpg complexes
hpg ~final conc. 5.0 mm! was incubated with 5.5 mm each of
sk or mutant sk at 22 8c in 50 mm tris.cl, ph 7.5, containing
0.5% bsa. the amidolytic activity was determined periodically
by transferring a suitable aliquot of the complex ~final concentration in reaction, 100 nm! to a 100 ml cuvette containing assay
buffer along with 1 mm chromozyme pl in a final volume of
100 ml. the change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored to
compute the kinetics of amidolytic activation ~see nihalani et al.,
1998! by plotting the slopes of the progress curves from the initial
periods ~2– 4 min! as a function of pre-incubation times. the generation of an npgb-reactive active center by equimolar sk0skmutant and hpg was monitored at 22 8c as described by wohl
et al. ~1980!. the reaction was initiated by adding 5 mm hpg
~final concentration! to an assay cuvette containing buffer ~10 mm
napo4 , ph 7.2! and sk ~5.5 mm! and 100 mm npgb. the release
of  xxxd2821xxx  due to acylation of the active center was detected
by continuous monitoring at 410 nm.
assays for determining the steady-state kinetic constants
for hpg activator activity of sk and sk mutants
to determine the kinetic parameters for hpg activation, fixed
amounts of sk or sk mutant ~1 to 10 nm! were added to a 100 ml
assay cuvette containing chromogenic substrate ~1 mm! and varying concentrations of hpg ~0.035 to 2.0 mm! and activator activity
measured as described above. in cases where the kinetic constants
of hpg activation of sk0sk mutant- xxxg1074xxx  complexes were to be
measured, the respective equimolar sk- xxxg1074xxx  complexes were
formed immediately prior to the determination of hpg activation

parameters for hpg activation were then calculated from inverse,

in all cases. a mean residue weight of 114 for sk was used ~radek
& castellino, 1989!, and the final spectrum was an average of 10
scans.

assays for determining the steady-state kinetic constants
for amidolytic activity of sk and sk mutants
the kinetic parameters of amidolysis by sk or sk mutants
complexed with  xxxg1074xxx  were determined by precomplexing equimolar ratios of sk and  xxxg1074xxx  ~200 nm each! at 22 8c in 50 mm
tris{cl, ph 7.5, containing 0.5% bsa. the amidolytic activity
was measured by transferring an aliquot of this mixture to a 100 ml
assay cuvette containing buffer ~50 mm tris{cl, ph 7.5! and varying concentrations of the chromogenic substrate ~0.1–2.0 mm! to
obtain a final concentration of 100 nm of the complex in the
reaction. the reaction was continuously monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm for 4–5 min. the kinetic parameters were
determined from lineweaver–burke plots by standard methods
~wohl et al., 1980!. in cases where kinetic constants were determined for sk-hpg complexes, sk0sk mutants were preincubated with equimolar hpg and allowed to mature at 22 8c until the
generation of maximum amidolytic capability, and then transferred
to assay cuvettes as described above for the determination of amidolytic parameters.
