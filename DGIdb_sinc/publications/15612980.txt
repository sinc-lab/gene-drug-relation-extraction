summary
genetic determinants for high homocysteine (hcy) levels are now well known.
we studied several single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in hcy-regulating
genes [ xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ) c677t and a1298c;
 xxxg1479xxx  (ms) a2756g;  xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx )
a66g] in relation to total plasma hcy levels, transplant coronary artery disease
and thromboembolic episodes in 84 heart transplant patients, and we compared the incidence of these polymorphisms with those in a healthy adult controls. at least one copy of the g allele of the  xxxg1480xxx  a66g snp was found in a
significantly greater proportion of cardiac transplant (ctx) recipients compared with controls (94.0% vs. 79.9% respectively). none of the snp analyzed
were correlated with total hcy plasma levels or the presence of transplant coronary artery disease. however, ms a2756g was significantly associated with
cobalamin levels (aa genotype: 290 ± 122 pmol/l; ag: 381 ± 151 pmol/l and
gg: 415 ± 100 pmol/l), as was  xxxg1480xxx  a66g (aa: 478 ± 219 pmol/l, ag:
306 ± 124 pmol/l and gg: 306 ± 123 pmol/l).  xxxg1480xxx  a66g was also correlated
with serum folate. no association was found with thromboembolic events. in
conclusion, there was a significant difference in the frequency of the g allele
genotype of the  xxxg1480xxx  a66g in ctx patients versus controls. differences in
cobalamin and folate levels with the  xxxg1480xxx  a66g and ms a2756g polymorphisms were noted. thus, snp in hcy-regulating genes may be important
determinants of vitamin metabolism in ctx, raising the question of increased
vitamin requirements to minimize increased plasma hcy in this high-risk
group.

introduction
the success of heart transplantation is based on acceptance of the graft by the recipient’s immune system. this
depends on many factors, including differences between
donor and recipient major histocompatibility complex
genes. in the past few years, donor and recipient single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) have been also shown
to correlate with graft outcomes [1].

hyperhomocysteinemia is common after heart transplantation [2–4]. the consequences of this metabolic
abnormality are not completely understood, but epidemiological data suggest an association between hyperhomocysteinemia and transplant coronary artery disease
(txcad) [5,6]. moreover, a recent study in rats showed
that increased homocysteine (hcy) levels might have detrimental effects on graft arteries. there are multiple reasons for the increased total plasma homocysteine (thcy)
29

polymorphisms of homocysteine-related genes in heart transplantation

levels seen in cardiac transplant (ctx) recipients, and, as
in healthy subjects, nutritional and genetics factors are
important [4].
methionine is a methyl donor for several important
biochemical reactions, resulting in the formation of hcy
[7]. homocysteine can be metabolized in two different
ways: it can be degraded through the transsulfuration
pathway, or it can be remethylated to regenerate methionine (fig. 1). this later reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme
complex,  xxxg1479xxx  (ms), using cobalamin as
the primary cofactor. the methyl group is donated by
methyl tetrahydrofolate, yielding methionine and tetrahydrofolate. this last moiety is regenerated by acceptance
of a methylene group, derived from serine and hydride
transfer, and catalyzed by the methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) enzyme. although ms uses cobalamin as a cofactor, it must be present in the co(iii) form to
be active. however, the metal ion is easily reduced
[co(iii) ﬁ co(ii)] and must be reoxidized by ms reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) pathway to maintain catalytic activity.
several functional snp in the genes encoding the
enzymes governing hcy metabolism have been identified
[8]. some are known to modify the activity of the
enzyme, and have been associated with abnormal hcy
metabolism. there are multiple studies linking  xxxg1475xxx 
c677t to atherogenic and thrombogenic diseases, particularly in the setting of folate deficiency. higher hcy levels

patients
cardiac transplant recipients (n ¼ 84) were consecutively
enrolled from the heart transplant clinic at the toronto
general hospital. informed consent was required to participate in this study. the protocol was approved by the
hospital ethics committee. for the purpose of genetic
analysis, controls were obtained from a large series of
healthy young adults (mean age 41 ± 18 years; mean thcy
6.5 ± 3.0 lmol/l) from the same urban toronto population recruited through the family medicine unit at the
toronto university health network [13].

sam

figure 1 homocysteine (hcy) is metabolized to methionine (met) by
 xxxg1479xxx  (ms) using as cofactor cobalamin and accepting
a methyl group from 5¢-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (ch3-thf), yielding
tetrahydrofolate (thf). this moiety is generated by  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ). cobalamin is spontaneously oxidized
( xxxg1454xxx ) and needs to be regenerated to its active form ( xxxg1455xxx ) by the
enzyme  xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) converting s-adenosylmethinine (sam) to s-adenosil-homocysteine (sah).

in ctx recipients homozygous for the t allele have been
found [9,10] specifically in association with low folate levels. there is no apparent association between  xxxg1475xxx 
c677t and txcad [9].
hyperhomocysteinemia is known to alter the antithrombotic properties of the endothelium. subjects with
very high hcy concentrations die at young age because of
thromboembolic complications (tc). hyperhomocysteinemia is prevalent after heart transplantation. a prothrombotic state, secondary to hyperhomocysteinemia,
may be one reason for the increased incidence of thromboembolic episodes in ctx [11]. moreover, the antithrombotic properties of graft vessels were shown to be
abnormal. the long-term development of txcad is related to the deposition of fibrin in distal vessels early after
transplantation [12]. it is likely that a combination of factors is responsible for the prothrombotic state in ctx,
but hyperhomocysteinemia may well play a role, particularly in the face of relative insufficiency of vitamin
cofactors required for hcy remethylation.
the purpose of this study was to perform genotype
analysis of common mutations in several enzymes
involved in the metabolism of hcy in our cohort of ctx
recipients. we compared genotype frequencies in ctx
recipients with those in a large health adult control population. we then analyzed circulating concentrations of
thcy, folate and cobalamin in relation to the different
snp. finally, we conducted a correlation analysis of each
of these genetic mutations with the presence of txcad.

blood collection and sample preparation
patients were fasting for at least 8 h. peripheral blood was
collected in the morning from an antecubital vein and
placed in edta tubes. for hcy analysis, blood was
immediately placed in ice and centrifuged within 30 min
after venipuncture. all plasma samples were frozen at
)70 c within 6 h until analysis. whole anticoagulated
blood samples dna was extracted from peripheral blood

cells as described previously [13] then coded and analyzed
in a blinded manner.
biochemical assays
total plasma hcy and methionine levels were assayed
using high-performance liquid chromatography with
electrochemical detection and pulsed integrated amperometry [14]. within-run and between-run coefficients of
variation for thcy assayed by this method are 3.1% and
3.8% respectively. folate and cobalamin levels were measured with a radioimmunoassay (quantaphase ii; bio-rad
laboratories, toronto, on, canada) as described previously [3]. biochemical analyses were carried out in 72
patients in 1997. in 1998, folate food fortification was
implemented nationwide in canada. this had a substantial effect on hcy levels in the general and ctx population, as we have reported [15,16]. therefore, our analysis
is restricted to those data collected prior to the onset of
the national fortification program.
genotyping methods
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t genotypes were read from a single multiplex assay designed to report prothrombin 20210a and
 xxxg749xxx  polymorphisms as well [13]. the specific
oligonucleotide primers for  xxxg1475xxx  c667t (table 1)
were designed on the basis of published data [17]. pcr
was carried out using the geneamp pcr system 9700
2 (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). in each
20 ll reaction, 50 ng genomic dna was mixed with 1x
pcr buffer 2.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm each of dntps, 0.5u
3 hotstartaqtm (qiagen, mississauga, on, canada) and
three pairs of primers (0.15 lmol/l for tmthfr,
0.75 lmol/l for fv, and 1 lmol/l for ptb). the pcr
reaction consisted of an initial 15 min of hotstartaqtm
activation at 94 c, followed by 30 cycles (20 s each) of
denaturation at 95 c, annealing for 20 s at 57 c, extentable 1. primers used in genetic analysis.

sion for 40 s (with an increment of 1 s for each subsequent cycle) at 72 c, and a final extension step of 5 min
at 72 c. the pcr product was incubated with hindiii
and taqi endonucleases for 2 h at 37 c followed by 2 h
at 60 c. following digestion, 8 ll of the product was
mixed with 2 ll of 5x loading dye [40% (w/v) sucrose;
0.01% bromphenol blue; 3.75x tae buffer] and subjected
to submerged electrophoresis on clearosetm bg gels
4 (elchrom scientific, cham, switzerland). the resolved
amplicons were visualized with ethidium bromide under
uv light. a blank control and known genotypes were run
with each assay.
 xxxg1475xxx  a1298c
a mutagenically separated pcr (ms-pcr) was designed
to identify the  xxxg1475xxx  a1298c locus (table 1). pcr was
carried out using the geneamp pcr system 9700
(applied biosystems). in each pcr reaction, 50 ng
genomic dna was used in 20 ll reaction mixture containing 1x pcr buffer, 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l dntps
and 0.5 u hotstartaqtm (qiagen) and 4.0 lmol/l of each
three primers. the cycling reaction consisted of an initial
15 min of hotstartaqtm activation at 94 c, followed by
30 cycles (30 s each) of denaturation at 95 c, 20 s annealing at 57 c, and 20 s of extension (with an increment of
1 s for each subsequent cycle) at 72 c, and a final extension step of 5 min at 72 c. electrophoresis and visualization were performed as described above.
 xxxg1480xxx  a66g
the a66g polymorphism in the  xxxg1480xxx  gene was analyzed by restricted digestion with ndei (new england
5 biolabs, pickering, on, canada) as described by wilson
et al. [18]. a mismatched base was introduced in the forward primer to create a ndei site in the normal sequence.
the pcr was carried out in 20 ll mixture of 1x pcr
buffer, 0.2 mm each of dntps, 0.25 u hotstartaqtm
(qiagen), 50 ng of genomic dna and 0.5 lm each of
primers (table 1). the reaction comprised an initial dna
denaturation and hotstartaqtm activation at 95 c for
15 min, 35 cycles of 94 c for 20 s, 56 c for 20 s and
72 c for 20 s with an increment of 1 s after each cycle
and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min. digestion of the
66 bp product was then carried out at 37 c overnight
and the resulting fragments were analyzed by 6% nusieve
3:1 agarose gel electrophoresis (biowhittaker molecular
6 applications, rockland, me, usa). the normal (a) allele
was cut giving fragments of 44 bp and 22 bp while the
mutated (g) allele remained uncut.
ms a2756g
the a2756g polymorphic site in the ms gene was amplified using previously published primers (table 1) [19].

the 20 ll reaction mixture contained 1x reaction buffer,
2 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm each of dntps, 0.5 lm each of the
primers, 0.5 u hotstartaqtm (qiagen) and 50 ng genomic dna. hotstartaqtm was activated at 95 c for
15 min, then the reaction went through 30 cycles of
94 c for 20 s, 58 c for 20 s and 72 c for 20 s with an
increment of 1 s after each cycle. there was a final extension at 72 c for 5 min. the 189 bp product was then
digested with haeiii (new england biolabs) at 37 c
overnight and separated by electrophoresis using precast
clearose bg gel. the mutant (g) allele was cut giving
fragments of 159 bp and 30 bp while the normal (a)
allele remained uncut.
txcad diagnosis
before 1997, our center routinely performed yearly angiographic evaluation of the coronary tree for txcad. since
then, this practice changed to screening dobutamine stress
echocardiogram yearly, and angiograms on an as needed
basis. of the transplant cohort, 48 patients had two or
more angiograms available for comparison regarding
txcad development. two independent investigators
reviewed these angiograms for txcad in a blinded manner, and stratified subjects into the presence or absence of
txcad development in comparison with the baseline
angiogram (year 1). the presence of txcad was considered positive if there was an obstructive lesion of 25% or
more of the lumen, as previous cited criteria [5].
thromboembolic complications
retrospective analysis of patient charts was performed to
identify the incidence of ischemic stroke, transient
ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and arterial embolism. each event was recorded for
analysis.

miriuka et al.

of the patients were white people, 8% were south asians,
5% african–americans and 4% were from the pacific
rim. the reason for cardiac transplantation was ischemic
cardiomyopathy in 67.9%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 19.0% and other cardiomyopathies in 13.1% of
subjects. there was no statistical association between pretransplant diagnosis and any of the snp (data not
shown).
analysis of different mutations involved in metabolism
of hcy, showed a significant difference in the  xxxg1480xxx 
a66g genotype (table 2). in ctx recipients 28 (33.3%)
subjects were homozygous for the gg genotype, while 51
(60.7%) subjects were heterozygous and five (5.9%) subjects were homozygous for the aa genotype. in the control population, the numbers were 56 (27.3%), 108
(52.6%) and 41 (20%) subjects, respectively (p ¼ 0.0075).
the g allele at position 66 of  xxxg1480xxx  was present in
63.6% (107/168) of ctr compared with 53.6% (220/410)
of controls (p ¼ 0.03). the rest of the snp were not significantly different between controls and ctx subjects.
biochemical data were available for analysis in 72 subjects. there was no genotype-specific difference in thcy
or methionine plasma levels for any of the snp. however,
cobalamin levels varied significantly on the basis of ms
a2756g genotypes. the mean level was 290 ± 122 pmol/l
for the aa genotype (n ¼ 53), 381 ± 151 pmol/l for the
ag genotype (n ¼ 16) and 415 ± 100 pmol/l for the gg
genotype (n ¼ 3, p ¼ 0.022; fig. 2) comparison by allele
showed that subjects with a g allele (ag or gg) had a
significantly higher plasma cobalamin level (ag + gg,
n ¼ 19: 386 ± 142 pmol/l vs. aa, n ¼ 53: 291 ±
122 pmol/l, p ¼ 0.006). there were two (2.8%) patients
with cobalamin deficiency (cobalamin <118 pmol/l) and

three (4.2%) patients with indeterminate cobalamin levels
(cobalamin <148 pmol/l). all five patients with low cobalamin status were aa genotype.
 xxxg1480xxx  a66g status was also significantly associated
with cobalamin and folate levels. cobalamin concentrations were 478 ± 219 pmol/l in the aa group (n ¼ 4),
306 ± 124 pmol/l in the ag group (n ¼ 44) and
306 ± 123 pmol/l in the gg group (n ¼ 24, p ¼ 0.042;
fig. 2). two patients with cobalamin deficiency were gg
genotype, three patients were in the indeterminate range
and were gg in one case and ga genotype in two. folate
concentrations were 18.0 ± 18.2 lmol/l in aa group,
7.9 ± 7.3 lmol/l in ag group and 7.3 ± 3.0 lmol/l in the
gg group (p ¼ 0.023).
data regarding the presence of tc was available in 81
subjects. mean time of follow up after transplant was
8.7 ± 3.1 years, and mean time from transplant to the tc
transplant international 18 (2005) 29–35 ª 2004 blackwell munksgaard ltd

was 4.1 ± 3.5 years. overall, 22 (26.2%) subjects had at
least one thromboembolic complication. a total of 34
thromboembolic events were recorded, of which 15
(44.1%) were stroke/transient ischemic attack, 13 (38.2%)
deep vein thrombosis, five (14.7%) pulmonary embolism
and one (2.9%) arterial occlusion. mean thcy was
23.9 ± 5.8 lmol/l in patients with tc and 26.4 ±
7.6 lmol/l in patients without tc (p ¼ 0.2).  xxxd2146xxx ,
cobalamin, cyclosporin level and creatinine were not significantly different between groups (data not shown).
however, patients with tc were older (56.7 ± 10.8 vs.
51.6 ± 9.4 years, p ¼ 0.056). the occurrence of tc was
not associated with any of the hcy-related snp (data not
shown).
as reported previously [6], 25 of 48 patients (52.1%)
developed txcad after a mean time of 5.3 ± 2.8 years
from the transplant. all patients presented hcy levels
above our upper normal limit of 15 lmol/l. the mean
hcy level in patients with txcad was 25.0 ± 5.9 lmol/l
compared with 21.9 ± 3.4 lmol/l in patients with no
txcad (p ¼ 0.029). hcy was an independent risk factor
for txcad in this cohort. however, the analysis of several snp related to hcy metabolism did not reveal any
association with txcad (table 3).
discussion
this paper describes a significantly increased incidence in
the g variant allele of the  xxxg1480xxx  a66g polymorphism in
our ctx cohort, compared with a healthy population.
however, heterozygosity or homozygosity in the g allele
was not associated with thcy concentrations. secondly, of
several frequent snp affecting hcy metabolism, none was
associated with thcy in our cohort. thirdly, both ms
33

polymorphisms of homocysteine-related genes in heart transplantation

a2756g and  xxxg1480xxx  a66g loci were associated with
plasma cobalamin levels. the  xxxg1480xxx  a66g snp was
found to be associated with folate concentrations as well.
fourthly, neither thcy nor related snp were associated
with tc in our cohort. finally, none of the snp were
associated with the development of txcad after a mean
follow-up interval of 5 years.
very high hcy levels are known to cause vascular
thrombosis, but only a decade ago it was recognized that
mild increases in thcy in the general population are also
associated with increased incidence of atherosclerosis and
thromboembolism [20]. in the last few years, this association has been extended to txcad [2,5,6]. although
there is a lack of information about the mechanism(s) by
which thcy is associated with txcad development, there
is a possible connection between hyperhomocysteinemic
atherosclerotic models and the role of oxidative stress in
the pathogenesis of txcad [2].
there are a few well-described genetic polymorphisms
associated with increased plasma hcy levels, especially
when folate or cobalamin levels are low [21]. moreover,
there is a correlation between these mutations and disease,
including neural tube defects [22], thromboembolism [23]
and atherosclerosis [21,24]. we compared the incidence of
common snp in genes involved in hcy metabolism in our
cohort of ctx patients versus healthy controls. we found
a significant increase in the frequency of the  xxxg1480xxx  variant g allele compared with controls. one plausible hypothesis is that subjects were preselected, based on their
previous cardiomyopathy history. however, we did not
find an association between  xxxg1480xxx  a66g genotype and
the pretransplant cardiomyopathy diagnosis. it could also
be argued that our control population was not represented, but the genotype distribution of our control population is in accordance to that of rady et al. [25] and
similar to white people distributions reported elsewhere.
although our ctx cohort was mostly white people, it
was not stratified to exclude individuals of non-white
background. however, the genotype distribution of  xxxg1480xxx 
a66g genotypes in our ctx group differs significantly
from all the ethnic groups reported by rady et al. [25].
of note, thcy levels were not different in those patients
with homozygosity or heterozygosity for the g allele,
although altered cobalamin and folate levels were associated with this allele. there may be other factors in the
ctx population, other than diet and genetic background
(i.e. immunosuppression, renal failure), that increase
thcy, because neither  xxxg1480xxx  a66g nor associated differences in cobalamin or folate associated with differences in
thcy. finally, the  xxxg1480xxx  polymorphism was not associated with the development of txcad, although we have
previously shown an association between high hcy levels
and txcad [6].

we did not confirm the findings of pethig et al. [9] or
potena et al. [10], who observed significantly higher thcy
levels in patients with the  xxxg1475xxx  677 tt genotype, and
association with folate levels. indeed, none of the snp
was associated thcy. this discordance may be related to
differences in the study groups. recently, a meta-analysis
of published studies about the impact of  xxxg1475xxx  c677t
on hcy levels confirmed a significant difference in the
impact of this snp on hcy levels only when study heterogeneity was accounted for [26]. there is little doubt that
sufficiency of folate intake is important in determining
thcy and its association with  xxxg1475xxx  c677t genotype.
folate intake has been greatly increased in the north
american population since 1998, when  xxxd2146xxx  fortification of flour and related products became mandatory, significantly increasing folate levels in the general
population, as we reported [15].
analysis of other snp ( xxxg1475xxx  a1256c and ms
a2756g) in genes involved in hcy metabolism did not
reveal any differences between study subjects and controls. this is not surprising, however, given the variability
of previous reports [8,21]. dietary factors such as vitamin
intake may be important confounders, limiting the power
to observe associations with genetic differences. cobalamin levels were significantly different, however, among different ms a2756g genotypes. we found that the presence
of at least one a allele was significantly associated with
decreased cobalamin. the impact of the aa genotype in
this population was also evident in that all patients with
cobalamin deficiency (<118 pmol/l) or with indeterminate cobalamin levels (>118 but <148 pmol/l) were in
this group. a similar finding in non-ctx subjects was
recently reported by yates et al. [27]. we hypothesize that
ctx recipients have a stressed hcy–cobalamin–folate axis,
and therefore have greater requirements for vitamins like
cobalamin and folate, depending on genotype. it may be
that altered ms activity is associated with increased cobalamin turnover, and depletes circulating cobalamin in
those with lower vitamin reserves. similar arguments have
been put forward for folate in the case of the  xxxg1475xxx 
c677t snp [28].
analysis of the  xxxg1480xxx  a66g mutation yielded similar
results. circulating cobalamin was significantly different
among genotypes, but in this case, folate levels were also
different. the  xxxg1480xxx  66 aa genotype was significantly
less frequent in ctx than in the control population, and
was associated with significantly higher levels of cobalamin and folate, but was not correlated with txcad.
the fact that ms a2756g and  xxxg1480xxx  a66g genotypes
were significantly associated with cobalamin levels in our
study has particular importance as heart transplant
patients are at risk for low cobalamin levels. unmeasured
alterations in hcy metabolism may be present. as these

polymorphisms of homocysteine-related genes in heart transplantation

alterations may have an impact on long-term outcomes
for at least some of the ctx population, a careful prospective study of cobalamin metabolism in relation to hcy
metabolism seems warranted. in the meantime, it seems
prudent to ensure that there is adequate b vitamin intake
in all ctx subjects.
