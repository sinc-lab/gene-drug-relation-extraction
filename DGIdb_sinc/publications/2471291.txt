the discrepancy

of hepatic gsh does
not appear to be sex-dependent

recent studies have found that the administration of morphine and related compounds
to rats and mice results in a loss of up to approximately 50% of hepatocellular glutathione (gsh) (james et al., 1982; james and
harbison, 1982: correia et al.. 1984b). gsh
in hepatocytes and other cells has a number
of important roles in biochemical processes
including modulation of protein conformation and enzyme activity. maintenance of

(mitchell et cl/., 1976: reed and beatty.
1980). while it is unclear whether this lossof
gsh contributes to the degenerative changes
observed after morphine administration to
mice (thureson-klein et n/.. 1978: needham
et al., 1981). it may explain the substantial
increase in hepatic injury from compounds

140

skoulis

dependent upon gsh for detoxification,
such as acetaminophen, cocaine, and carbon
tetrachloride, resulting from coadministration of morphine (ho et al., 1980: james ef
al., 1982).
a number of lines of evidence indicate that
morphine and other opioid drugs undergo
biotransformation
to reactive metabolites
which could account for hepatic gsh losses.
nagamatsu and co-workers have reported
that the combination of morphine with gsh
in the cytosolic fraction of mouse liver results in the formation of detectable amounts
of a morphinone-glutathione
conjugate and
identified a morphinone-cysteine
conjugate
in the proteolytic digest of liver proteins
taken from mice administered radiolabeled
morphine (nagamatsu et al., 1983). they further observed that the decline of gsh in isolated hepatocytes exposed to morphine was
paralleled by the formation of a morphinone-glutathione
conjugate and concluded
that the reactive metabolite from morphine
may be formed by a cytosolic enzyme, morphine 6-dehydrogenase (nagamatsu et al..
1986). correia and others alternatively have
proposed that reactive metabolite formation
from morphine and related compounds is cytochrome p450 mediated, and through a systematic study of the effects of various opioid
drugs on hepatic gsh in rats they concluded
that only those drugs possessing the (-)-3-hydroxy-n-methylmorphinan
moiety are capable of the required metabolic reaction (correia et al.. 1984a.b). they have characterized
the conjugated metabolite as 1o-a-s-(n-acetylcysteinyl)morphine
(krowech
et a/. ,
1986) although this metabolite has not as yet
been identified in viva.
recent studies in our laboratory indicate
that morphine also has the potential to diminish hepatic gsh in mice through a very
different mechanism, one that is initiated
within the central nervous system (roberts et
al., 1987). in the present study we have extended these observations by examining several other opioid analgesic drugs for potential
effects on hepatic gsh in mice, including

et al.

possible contributions by centrally initiated
actions. a comparison was made of responsiveness of hepatic gsh to central actions of
opioids in male versus female mice, and a series of experiments was conducted in order to
determine whether the ability of morphine to
potentiate the hepatotoxicity of other agents
may arise from a central action of morphine.

male and female icr mice, 20-25 g. were obtained
from harlan industries (indianapolis,
in). unless otherwise indicated.
each experiment
was conducted
using
male mice. animals were housed in aaalac-approved
animal quarters with a i?-hr light/dark
cycle on sawdust
bedding with free access to food and water for at least i
week prior to experimentation.
all drugs were administered in saline. injection
volumes were 10 ml drug solution/kg body wt for intraperitoneal
(ip) and intravenous
(iv) doses, and 5 ~1 injection
volume per animal for intracerebroventricular
(icv) doses. acetaminophen
dose solutions were warmed prior to administration
to facilitate
dissolution
of the compound.
the technique
for icv injection was a modification
of the method of lipman and
spencer ( 1980) as described
previously
(roberts
e/ al..
1987).
the icr strain is somewhat
insensitive
to the hepatotoxic effects ofacetaminophen
and cocaine (unpublished
observations).
in order to enhance the responsiveness
of
the icr mice to these hepatotoxins,
all mice in experiments measuring
acetaminophenor cocaine-induced
liver injury were pretreated
with phenobarbital,
80 mg/
kg. ip. for 4 days prior to experimentation.

according
to the method of allison

in order to minimize
the influence
of diurnal

results
several opioid analgesic drugs were tested
for their ability to depress hepatic gsh.
these drugs varied with respect to selectivity
for opioid receptor subtypes and analgesic
potency. preliminary
experiments
established that the greatest decline in hepatic
gsh in response to morphine occurred 3 hr
after the dose. this time interval was therefore used in each of the experiments measuring gsh changes in response to opioid analgesic treatment. each of the drugs was tested
over a range of doses and the response from
morphine,
100 mg/kg ip, was used as a
standard for comparison. no attempt was
made to establish dose-response relationships. rather, a qualitative
answer was
sought, viz., is the drug capable of diminishing hepatic gsh? the highest doses for which
results are reported are maximally tolerated
doses. a maximally tolerated dose, for the
purposes of these experiments, was one that

approximately 25-35% (table 1). it should
be noted that meperidine in these experiments was administered in two divided doses
of 100 mg/kg each, 1.5 hr apart. this was in
response to preliminary experiments which
indicated that the opioid effects of meperidine were comparatively short-lived in the
mouse. codeine, methadone, butorphanol,
nalbuphine, and pentazocine administration
produced no significant change in hepatic
gsh concentrations in doses up to and including those maximally tolerated.
a further series of experiments was conducted in order to determine which of the
opioid analgesics causing a loss of hepatic

 xxxd2061xxx ,
laam, and meperidine were
each administered to mice by the icv route
with the results compared to those obtained
with morphine, 100 yg, icv. because the decline in hepatic gsh following ip methadone
administration
was of borderline statistical
significance, methadone was also included in
these experiments. hydromorphone
and  xxxd2061xxx  both produced a decrease in hepatic gsh approximately equivalent to that
observed with icv morphine, and all three
drugs initiated changes in hepatic gsh after
icv administration
similar to those seen after
much larger systemic doses (table 2). meperidine and methadone. in icv doses up to those
maximally tolerated, did not cause a significant decline in hepatic gsh. laam also
failed to produce a significant loss of gsh in
the liver, but the maximum dose icv was limited by solubility rather than toxicity.

site, a dose equivalent to the icv dose was
administered by the iv route to simulate a
“worst-case” exit of the dose from the cns.
for each of these drugs, the effective icv dose
did not cause a significant change in hepatic
gsh when administered iv (table 3).
the apparent inability of laam and meperidine to influence hepatic gsh after icv
administration,
while both are effective after
ip administration
suggested that these drugs
may alter gsh through a peripheral mechanism. alternatively, each might act centrally,
but through a metabolite that is only formed
following systemic administration,
for example, by the liver. to explore this possibility,
the n-demethylated
metabolites of laam
and meperidine, i-a-acetylnormethadol
and
normeperidine,
respectively. were tested for
their effects on hepatic gsh after ip and icv
administration.
norlaam,
30 mg/kg ip,
caused a decrease in hepatic gsh to 56 + 9%
(mean k sd, n = 5) of control, while normeperidine, 90 mg/kg ip, was associated with
a gsh decline to 67 + 7% of control. both ndemethylated metabolites were also effective
by the icv route. the hepatic gsh following
norlaam,

dine, 100 pg icv, diminished hepatic gsh to
73 + 7% of control.
opioid-induced
changes in hepatic gsh
were not confined to males. female mice of
the same strain were administered morphine
and laam by both ip and icv routes. the
decreases in gsh after ip administration
of
both morphine (100 mg/kg) and laam (60
mg/kg) were essentially equivalent to those
seen after administration
of the same doses of
these agents in male mice (table 4). as in
male mice. the icv administration
of 100 pg
of morphine caused a depression of similar
magnitude, while icv administration
of 60 pg
of laam was without effect.
the icv administration
of morphine (100
pg) to male mice resulted in a modest elevation in serum alt activity (fig. 1). however,
when morphine was administered (100 pg,
icv) 3 hr after the ip administration
of either
cocaine (30 mg/kg) or acetaminophen (300
mg/kg) a striking increase in the hepatotoxicity of these agents, indicated by alt activities, was observed. the apparent synergistic
interaction of morphine on cocaine-induced
liver injury was also examined in female mice
(fig. 2). as in males, the icv administration
of morphine (100 pg) caused a substantial increase in the serum alt activities resulting
from ip administration
of cocaine (30 mg/kg)
while alone producing only a slight increase
in alt activities.

discussion
morphine has been observed previously to
depress hepatocellular gsh concentrations
in mice (james et al., 1982). in the present
study other opioid analgesic drugs were also
found to diminish hepatic gsh in mice, including
hydromorphone,
 xxxd2061xxx ,
laam, and meperidine when administered
by the ip route. an effect on gsh was not
common to all opioid analgesics, however,
and codeine, methadone, butorphanol, nalbuphine, and pentazocine produced no
changes in hepatic gsh in doses up to those
approaching acute lethality. correia and coworkers have previously examined the effects
of various opioid agents on hepatic gsh in
rats and also found that morphine and hydromorphone decreased gsh concentrations
while codeine did not (correia et al., 1984b).
interestingly,  xxxd2061xxx ,
given in doses
equimolar with morphine, did not influence
gsh in rats in that study, while in the present
study in mice  xxxd2061xxx  produced a decrease in hepatic gsh comparable to morphine at a less-than-equimolar
dose.
in a previous study using peptides and
other compounds with relative specificity for
opioid receptor subtypes. it was concluded
that a decrease in hepatic gsh appeared to
be a function of p- and possibly &opioid receptor stimulation, but not stimulation of k-

opioid

analgesics

caused a decline in hepatic gsh while compounds with weak (codeine) or absent p-agonist effects (butorphanol), or with p-antagonist effects (pentazocine and nalbuphine).
produced no change in hepatic gsh in ip
doses up to those maximally tolerated. while
some of the effective opioid analgesics also
possess stimulating effects at k- or a-opioid receptors, there was no apparent correlation between activity at these receptors and hepatic
gsh depression. for example, neither pentazocine nor butorphanol, both with significant k- and a-opioid agonist properties, had
any effect on hepatic gsh.
in view of this apparent relationship between p-opioid receptor stimulation and hepatic gsh depression, it is unclear why the
p-agonist drug methadone (neil, 1984) was
not effective. methadone was tested a number of times and consistently showed an
equivocal response when administered ip and
was negative when administered icv in doses
up to and including those maximally tolerated. toxicity prevented methadone administration in doses greater than 20% of the molar equivalent dose of morphine by the ip
route and 40% by the icv route. as such, toxicity may have precluded attaining a concentration of methadone sufficient to produce significant receptor-mediated effects on
gsh. since the mechanism for central opioid-induced loss of gsh is unknown, an alternative explanation may be that methadone possesses an additional pharmacologic
action which antagonizes its receptor-mediated effect on gsh.
among the agents which diminished hepatic gsh, morphine, hydromorphone,
and
 xxxd2061xxx 
were shown to have a central
site of action which was capable of producing
a hepatic response equivalent to that produced by systemic (ip) administration.
in
contrast, laam and meperidine were only
effective when administered
systemically.
while maximally tolerated doses of laam
could not be administered icv because of solubility, the possibility that laam is ineffective by this route must be considered. one in-

terpretation of these observations is that
laam and meperidine produce their effects
to diminish hepatic gsh through a peripheral mechanism. it has been postulated that
laam may decrease gsh through the formation of a reactive metabolite which forms
a cytochrome p450 metabolic intermediate
complex (james and harbison, 1982). similar studies have not been reported for meperidine. meperidine and laam also may produce their effects centrally, but indirectly
through their metabolites. previous studies
have suggested that laam itself is inactive,
and that its pharmacologic effects are in fact
attributable to its metabolites norlaam, dinorlaam,
and normethadol
(sung and
way, 1954: veatch et al., 1964). if laam
must be n-demethylated in the liver to be active, this would explain the effectiveness of
laam after ip but not icv administration.
meperidine effects on gsh may also be due
to its n-demethylated metabolite, normeperidine. normeperidine
appears to possess
pharmacologic effects distinct from its parent
compound in the mouse (gilbert and martin,
1975) and excitatory effects of meperidine in
humans have been attributed to this metabolite (kaiko et al., 1983).
previous studies of morphine-induced
depression of hepatic gsh have all been conducted using male animals.. it was interesting
to note in the present study that the effect of
morphine on hepatic gsh occurred essentially equally in male and female mice after
both ip and icv administration
(tables 1 and
4). hepatic responses to laam were also
identical in male and female mice, including
the difference in effectiveness of laam following ip versus icv administration.
though
it is difficult to draw any mechanistic inferences from these observations, they indicate
that any interactions resulting from central
opioid actions on hepatic gsh may be expected to occur in both sexes of mice.
earlier studies from our laboratory found
that the ip administration
of morphine (100
mg/kg) increased the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen and cocaine in mice (james et al.,

146

skoulis

1982). it appears from the present study that
a central action of morphine may account for
this interaction, as substantial increases in
hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen and cocaine were observed when morphine was administered icv. though morphine icv alone
caused a slight increase in serum alt activities, as has been observed by others (chang
and ho, 1979: needham et al.. 1981), the
magnitude of this increase is clearly inadequate to account for the increases observed
when morphine (icv) and acetaminophen or
cocaine were combined. the potential for a
similar interaction
in female mice was
examined with cocaine. as in males, the icv
administration
of morphine resulted in a
substantial increase in hepatotoxicity
as
indicated by serum alt activities. the magnitude of the increase was less than that observed in males, perhaps due to the comparatively higher toxicity resulting from cocaine
alone (with saline icv) in the females. a
greater sensitivity of female mice to cocaineinduced liver injury has been noted by others
(thompson et al., 1984).
both acetaminophen and cocaine appear
to be dependent upon gsh for detoxification
in the liver (mitchell et al.. 1973; evans and
harbison, 1978). and depletion of gsh by
chemical agents such as diethyl maleate or
buthionine
sulfoximine
has been demonstrated to result in a potentiation of their hepatotoxicities (evans and harbison,
1978;
wong and corcoran, 1987). though the
magnitude of gsh loss produced by morphine and other opioid analgesics in these experiments is less than that typically observed
in studies using diethyl maleate or buthionine
sulfoximine, this loss may nonetheless be
sufficient to result in increased liver injury
from acetaminophen and cocaine. the ability of a centrally mediated event induced by
opioids to modulate hepatic gsh to the extent of influencing the vulnerability of this organ to toxic injury from chemicals is a novel
concept and has important pharmacological
and toxicological implications.
