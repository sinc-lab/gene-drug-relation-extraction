abstract
objectives: to compare the effectivenesses of three phenytoin-loading techniques. methods: patients with subtherapeutic phenytoin concentrations who presented within 48
hours of a seizure were randomized to receive either 20 mg/
kg of oral phenytoin (po), divided in maximum doses of 400
mg every two hours, 18 mg/kg of intravenous phenytoin
(ivp) at an initial infusion rate of 50 mg/min, or 18 mg/kg
(phenytoin equivalents) of intravenous fosphenytoin (ivf)
at an initial infusion rate of 150 mg/min. results: a total of
45 patients were enrolled: 16 in the po group, 14 in the ivp
group, and 15 in the ivf group. the times required to reach
therapeutic drug concentrations were (mean 6 standard
deviation [sd]) 5.62 6 0.28 hours, 0.24 6 0.3 hours, and
0.21 6 0.28 hours, respectively. a total of 17, 27, and 32
adverse drug events were observed in the po, ivp, and ivf

groups, respectively, with significantly fewer events in the
po group (p ¼ 0.02, p ¼ 0.01). no significant difference was
found between the numbers of necessary adjustments to the
infusions in the two iv groups. the average time to safe
emergency department discharge was significantly shorter
for the iv groups compared with the po group (p\0.001).
conclusions: oral loading has fewer adverse drug events
than either iv loading method, but its use may be limited
when therapeutic concentrations are required quickly.
although ivf loading is faster, from an adverse-drug event
perspective, no advantage of ivf over ivp was apparent.
key words: phenytoin; anticonvulsants; emergency department; adverse drug events; randomized, controlled trial.

phenytoin remains one of the most commonly used
antiepileptic medications. patients normally controlled
on phenytoin presenting to the emergency department
(ed) with a history of recent seizure are frequently
found on laboratory analysis to have subtherapeutic
serum concentrations. although they are no longer
actively seizing, it is common practice to administer
a loading dose of phenytoin to these patients while

they are still in the ed. the rationale behind this
practice is that the achievement of therapeutic concentrations will prevent further seizures and make ed
discharge safe.
methods for loading phenytoin both orally and
intravenously vary widely from institution to institution, and even within institutions.1,2 differences exist
in the pharmacokinetic and adverse-drug event (ade)
profiles of the commonly used methods. the intravenous route provides rapid attainment of therapeutic serum concentrations, but it is associated with
significant morbidity related to its  xxxd3034xxx 
vehicle.3–5 for this reason, intravenous administration
requires close monitoring, and thus significant resources in the ed. the oral route frequently results in
delayed achievement of desired therapeutic serum
concentrations because of its capacity-limited absorption.6–10 given its delayed absorption when administered in a large single dose,7,9,11 many practitioners are
concerned that serum concentrations are not attained
rapidly or reliably enough for safe ed discharge. it also
is unclear what optimal loading dose(s) and interval
should be used in the oral loading method. several
regimens have been proposed.7,8,12–14
fosphenytoin, the recently introduced prodrug
of phenytoin, is rapidly converted to phenytoin by
plasma and tissue esterases after its intravenous
administration.15 because it is not formulated in the
 xxxd3034xxx  vehicle, it may be administered
more rapidly than intravenous phenytoin.15 although

fosphenytoin is significantly more expensive than
either oral or intravenous phenytoin, some authors
have proposed that the faster infusion rate and lower
incidence of ades make administration of this more
expensive drug more cost-effective than either of the
two other methods.16–18 the purpose of our study was
to determine the cost–effectiveness of three methods
of loading phenytoin in the ed: intravenous phenytoin (ivp), oral phenytoin (po), and intravenous
fosphenytoin (ivf). we determined effectiveness by
comparing adverse event rates and by calculating the
time to safe ed discharge. the time to safe ed
discharge was defined by the time at which therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin ($10 mg/l) were
achieved and there was absence of any adverse events
that precluded discharge. the cost–effectiveness was
determined by comparing the net costs and numbers
of adverse events, and the net costs required to
achieve the time to safe ed discharge. in this article,
we report the effectiveness data. a subsequent article
will report the cost–effectiveness data.

methods
study design. this was a randomized, prospective,
controlled trial. the facility’s institutional review
board approved the study protocol. signed, written
informed consent was obtained from all patients by
one of the investigators or the treating physician
before enrollment. patients were enrolled between
october 1999 and may 2001.
study setting and population. patients were selected from the ed at the los angeles county
university of southern california medical center, an
urban tertiary care facility. the study population was
a convenience sample. patients were considered
eligible if the treating physician determined that they
required phenytoin loading and the study investigators determined that they met the following inclusion
and exclusion criteria. inclusion criteria were: patient
age $18 years, a history of seizure in the preceding 48
hours, a known history of a seizure disorder, seizures
controlled on maintenance (chronic) po therapy, and
a subtherapeutic concentration of phenytoin (\5 mg/
ml) on laboratory determination. exclusion criteria
were: the concurrent use (at time of presentation) of
 xxxd3485xxx ,  xxxd2090xxx , or topiramate; the administration of other antiepileptic drugs in the out-ofhospital setting or in the ed before enrollment; the
inability to take oral medications; the presence of status
epilepticus (either in the out-of-hospital setting or in
the ed); the presence of any acute central nervous
system pathology (e.g., meningitis, abscess, intracranial hemorrhage, acute head injury); the presence of an
acute metabolic derangement that may have caused
the seizure (e.g., hyponatremia or hypercalcemia); and
the presence of hepatic insufficiency on the basis of

245
initial history, physical examination, or laboratory data
(i.e., total bilirubin [3.0 mg/dl, prothrombin time
[14 seconds, or albumin \3.0 mg/dl). whereas
alcoholism itself was not an exclusion criterion,
patients in whom seizures were solely a result of
alcohol withdrawal were not included.
study protocol. after consent was obtained and all
clinical care, with the exception of phenytoin loading,
was completed, patients were transferred to the
general clinical research center (gcrc) for randomization and study-drug administration. patients were
randomized to one of three treatment arms using
a predetermined randomization sequence using blocks
of six. no delay in necessary care occurred as a result of
the study protocol; phenytoin loading was performed
directly after randomization. the investigators were
not blinded to the randomization arm.
an automated blood pressure cuff was applied to all
patients, and patients in the intravenous groups were
placed on a cardiac monitor during the infusion. a
heparin lock was placed in the upper extremity of all
patients, and an intravenous catheter was placed in the
contralateral arm of those patients receiving intravenous study medication. the specific location and
caliber of these catheters were left to the discretion of
the health care providers. serial heparinized blood
samples were collected through the heparin lock.
study medication was labeled according to the
randomization sequence and provided for each patient. each patient received study medication by one of
the following methods: 1) 20 mg/kg of phenytoin
sodium in 100-mg capsules orally; 2) a continuous
intravenous infusion of 18 mg/kg of phenytoin at the
initial rate of 50 mg/min via intravenous pump (alaris
signature edition infusion pump, alaris medical
systems, inc., san diego, ca); or 3) a continuous
infusion of 18 mg/kg ivf (75 mg/ml phenytoin
equivalents) at an initial rate of 150 mg/min via
intravenous syringe pump (baxter auto syringe
as40a, baxter, inc., deerfield, il). the slightly higher
doses used for po were chosen because of the 90%
bioavailability of the oral formulation.
to determine the amount of study medication to be
administered, patient weight was rounded up to the
nearest 5 kg. to maximize absorption in the oral group,
the number of capsules administered was divided into
intervals of two hours, with a maximum of 400 mg to be
given during each interval. ivp and ivf were mixed at
the time of administration to standardized concentrations. if the patient did not tolerate the initial
infusion rates because of local reactions (e.g., venous
irritation, infiltration) and/or systemic complications
(e.g., pruritus, hypotension), the infusion was adjusted
according to a standardized study protocol (see table
1) to maximize the likelihood of patient tolerability. a
provision was made for rescue benzodiazepine dosing
to be administered by the gcrc staff if the patient

experienced any seizure activity during the loading or
the study observation period. the use of benzodiazepines or other anticonvulsant medications remained at
the discretion of the study physicians. any rescue
medications as well as their doses and times of
administration were recorded on the data-collection
sheet. when ades related to the loading process were
encountered, all modifications, adjustments, and substitutions to the loading protocols were implemented
according to standardized guidelines outlined by the
investigators in the protocol (see table 1). all such
interventions, along with their times, were recorded on
the data-collection forms.
after the ten-hour pharmacokinetic sample was
drawn, patients were given the option of remaining in
the gcrc or leaving and returning for the 24-hour
reassessment. a clinical evaluation was performed at
24 hours for all groups, including the drawing of the
24-hour blood concentration and an assessment for
any adverse events or further seizure activity.
measurements. before patient enrollment, the following data were collected: patient age; gender; race
and ethnicity; details of seizure history; and out-ofhospital course, including medications administered,
medication history, and a focused history and physical examination. baseline phenytoin concentrations
and albumin concentrations were obtained for all
patients.
sequential blood pressure determinations were
made at regular intervals during the loading and
specimen collection periods. pharmacokinetic samples were obtained at the initiation of the intravenous
loading regimens and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1,
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours thereafter. for the po group,
samples were obtained at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24
hours. the blood samples were centrifuged within 30
minutes and the serum separated and stored at 708c
until they were assayed.
plasma phenytoin concentrations were determined
according to previously published fluorescence polarization immunoassay (fpia) (tdx, abbott laboratories, chicago, il) methods. samples were analyzed in

batch and in duplicate. the assay was linear between
6.75 and 33 mg/l. the interday assay coefficient of
variation for the determination of phenytoin was 0.2%
(standard deviation [sd] 6 0.571). the root mean
squared error for the calibration curves was 0.8. the
minimum detectable concentration was 0.02 mg/l.
samples that exceeded the maximum detectable limit
were diluted and re-assayed.
patients in the intravenous groups were formally
assessed for the presence of ades at 5-minute intervals
during intravenous loading and thereafter at each
blood draw. patients in the po group were assessed for
ades at each blood draw. these assessments were
made by the gcrc research nurses according to
training provided by the clinical investigators. ades
were grouped into local (pain, phlebitis and extravasation, perineal pruritus), cardiovascular (dysrhythmia, hypotension), neurologic (seizure activity,
disorientation, nystagmus, and ataxia), and gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting).
more specifically, pain, phlebitis, and extravasation
were grouped together and defined as any redness,
swelling, tenderness, or pain around the intravenous
site. hypotension was defined as a systolic blood
pressure \100 mm hg or a decrease of mean arterial
pressure from baseline of 20% or greater. any dysrhythmia on cardiac monitoring was considered
significant. ataxia was defined as the presence of either
truncal or gait instability. any direction of nystagmus
was considered abnormal. disorientation was defined
as any impairment in the standard orientation questions. any seizure activity was considered abnormal.
nausea and perineal pruritus were subjectively identified by patients.
data analysis. sample size calculations were performed by the department of biostatistics at lac+
usc medical center. these calculations were based
on the parameters required to conduct a cost-effectiveness study. the pharmacoeconomic parameters
used in the determination of sample size included the
costs of drug and other products used in the loading
process, the costs of nursing and medical personnel
time, and the rates of ades as estimated from a chart
review. based on the total estimated costs for each arm,
the sample size was calculated to detect a minimum
difference of 30% in cost between the three groups
with 80% power. a total sample size of 180, with 60
patients per group, was conservatively chosen on the
basis of this analysis. an interim analysis was
performed after the enrollment of the first 45 patients,
at which time a significant difference in cost–effectiveness was found among the three groups.
peak plasma concentration (cmax) and time to peak
concentration (tmax) of phenytoin were derived directly from measured values. the area under the
plasma phenytoin concentration–time curve (auc)
was calculated by use of the linear trapezoidal method

(auc0–24). the noncompartmental analysis was performed using microsoft excel (pk functions for microsoft excel, joel i. usansky, phd, atul desai, ms, and
diane tang-liu, phd, department of pharmacokinetics
and drug metabolism allergan, irvine, ca).
in each group, the mean time to therapeutic
concentration was calculated by averaging the time
at which the serum phenytoin concentration reached
10 mg/ml or greater for each patient. ades were
itemized by type and then added together to obtain
a total number in each group. for the two intravenous
groups, calculations included the mean number of
times the infusion rate was adjusted and the mean
time required to administer study medication. the
average time to safe ed discharge was calculated in
each group. this was defined as the time at which
therapeutic concentrations were achieved and the
patient was free of ades precluding discharge.
baseline demographic data among the three groups
were compared using a three-way chi-square test. the
individual ades in each group were compared using
the chi-square test. the total numbers of ades among
the groups were compared using the kruskal-wallis
test and mann-whitney tests. the numbers of adjustments to the infusion in each of the intravenous arms
were compared using the mann-whitney test. oneway analysis of variance (anova) using the kruskalwallis test and dunn’s multiple-comparison test was
used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters for
phenytoin between the three treatment arms. the
graphs and statistical analysis were performed using
graphpad prism version 3.03 (graphpad software,
san diego, ca). the anova test was used to
compare the times to therapeutic concentrations and
safe ed discharge. data are reported as means 6 sds
or proportions, as appropriate. the statistical tests
were two-tailed and were considered significant at an
alpha level of 0.05.

results
a total of 45 patients were enrolled in the study
between october 1999 and may 2001. significant

differences were found in the primary outcome
measures at the time of the interim analysis. patient
recruitment was hampered because of difficulties
with the identification of patients by rotating ed
housestaff and shortages in nursing staff to administer the study protocol. all patients enrolled remained
in the gcrc for the initial ten-hour study period. two
patients did not return for the 24-hour evaluation.
baseline demographic information of the study
population is given in table 2. a total of 16 patients
(35.6%) were randomized to receive po, 14 (31.1%) to
receive ivp, and 15 (33.3%) to receive ivf.
pharmacokinetic analysis. table 3 depicts the mean
(6 sd) and median (interquartile range) of the doses
administered as well as the auc0–24, cmax, and tmax for
each study group. the higher dose of orally administered phenytoin was intended by design to account for
the lower bioavailability when compared with the
parenteral formulation. the auc0–24 for ivp is
significantly greater than that of ivf and po. there is
no difference in auc0–24 between ivf and po. in the
ivf group, the cmax was significantly greater and the
tmax significantly shorter than for ivp and po, and was
predictable given the faster administration of ivf
despite the frequent changes in infusion rates required
in the majority of patients. there is a large variability in
the cmax and tmax for ivf (figure 1), given the frequent
changes in infusion rate relative to the short total
administration time of the infusion.
time to therapeutic concentration. the mean
times to therapeutic concentration (phenytoin $10
mg/l) were 5.62 6 0.28 hours, 0.24 6 0.3 hours, and
0.21 6 0.28 hours in the po, ivp, and ivf groups,
respectively (table 4).
seizures and ades. there were a total of five
seizures observed after patients were randomized.
one seizure occurred in the po group. at the time of
this seizure, which occurred during the loading
process, the phenytoin concentration was found to

be in the therapeutic range. there were four seizures
recorded in the ivf arm. one of these seizures
occurred immediately following randomization,
before the initiation of the loading protocol, and the
remaining three occurred after the completion of the
loading protocol. serum phenytoin concentrations
were therapeutic in each of these cases. no seizure
was observed in the ivp group.
in total, 76 ades were recorded: 17 in the po group,
27 in the ivp group, and 32 in the ivf group
(p ¼ 0.015). the lower incidence of ades in the po
group compared with the two iv groups was statistically significant (ivp vs. po, p ¼ 0.02; ivf vs.
po, p ¼ 0.01). there was no significant difference
between the two iv groups (p ¼ 0.55). the numbers of
patients experiencing at least one ade were 10, 14,
and 15 in the po, ivp, and ivf groups, respectively
(p ¼ 0.002). for each type of ade, significant differences between the groups were found only for pain
and phlebitis at the infusion site (11 patients in the ivp
group vs. 3 in the ivf group, p\0.001) and perineal
pruritus (12 patients in ivf group vs. 0 in the ivp
group, p\0.001). there was no significant difference
in the incidence of hypotension (two patients in the
ivp group and one patient in the ivf group). one
patient in the ivf group experienced a brief episode of
sinus tachycardia during the iv infusion that could not
be otherwise explained. after 5 minutes, the tachycardia resolved spontaneously and did not recur. table 5
summarizes the ades in the three groups.
total time of intravenous loading and number of
adjustments to intravenous infusion. the ivp
group required a significantly longer duration of
infusion than the ivf group (60.7 6 50.6 minutes vs.
20.1 6 23.6 minutes, p ¼ 0.01). seven of 14 (50%)
patients receiving ivp and six of 15 (40%) patients
receiving ivf required at least one adjustment of the
intravenous infusion because of ades. the total
numbers of adjustments to the infusion rate required
during the loading process were not significantly

different between the ivp and ivf groups. these data
are summarized in table 6.
average time to safe ed discharge. the average
times to safe ed discharge were 6.4 6 2.2 hours,
1.7 6 0.8 hours, and 1.3 6 1.0 hours, in the po, ivp,
and ivf groups, respectively (p\0.01; ivp vs. po,
p\0.001; ivf vs. po, p\0.001). table 4 outlines the
time to reach therapeutic concentration and average
time to safe ed discharge in the three groups.

discussion
there remains no standard for the loading of
phenytoin in the ed patient. although the choice
of loading technique may vary depending on the
circumstances of each case, the factors involved in
this decision remain the same. these include the time
to therapeutic phenytoin concentrations, ades, and
cost of administration.
the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints used in
our analysis were cmax and tmax. the auc0–24 reflects
the 24-hour exposure of the patient to phenytoin.
higher concentrations were observed in the ivp
group compared with the ivf and po groups. two
explanations deserve mention. first, the higher cmax
in the ivp group compared with the po group is
expected. for this reason, we gave a higher dose to the
po group (20 mg/kg) compared with the ivp (18 mg/
kg) and ivf (18 mg/kg phenytoin equivalents)
groups. however, despite the greater dose in the po
group, the absorption still was lower in the oral
group. as is standard in studies evaluating pharmacokinetics, we had patients remain fasting until two
hours after the last dose of the po regimen to ensure
uniformity in absorption. the po absorption may
have been greater had we fed patients a fatty meal,
because phenytoin is lipid-soluble.
second, there was an unexpected difference in the
auc0–24 between the ivp and ivf groups. one
possible explanation for this observation is a difference in metabolizing capacity between the two

groups. we do not believe (or have any evidence to
suggest) that this difference could be attributed to
differences in plasma esterase activity. this is in
contrast to published food and drug administration
registration trials for fosphenytoin, in which the auc
was not different from that for phenytoin. however,
these initial studies were performed in a crossover
fashion, by which the same patient receives each drug
such that no difference in metabolism is apparent.
patients in our study were different in each group.
another possible explanation for the difference in

249
auc0–24 between the ivp and ivf groups is that there
may have been residual enzyme induction from drugs
that patients may have taken up to a week before
study but were no longer taking (undetectable serum
drug concentrations) (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital). however, only two patients in the ivp group
had taken phenobarbital in the past. one was
noncompliant for at least three weeks before, and
the other had discontinued the medication six months
before the ed visit. in the ivf group, one patient had
taken phenobarbital and carbamazepine but had not
been compliant with either medication for an unknown length of time.
the cmax was significantly higher and the tmax was
significantly shorter in the ivf groups compared with
the ivp and po groups. this is explained by the faster
infusion rate for ivf (maximum, 150 mg/min) than
for ivp (50 mg/min) (see table 5). the tmax for the po
arm was expectedly variable, given its poor dissolution and high lipid solubility. the analysis of the
plasma concentration–time curves was performed
using a noncompartmental approach. upon inspection of the ivp and ivf time–concentration curves
(figure 1), a biexponential decline in concentrations
was present, suggesting that perhaps a two-compartment model may be necessary to describe the
disposition following a single dose of phenytoin
administered in this study. upon inspection of the
time–concentration curve for the po arm, the distribution phase is not distinguished but may be
obscured by the prolonged absorption phase.
the mean time to therapeutic concentrations using
po loading are substantially longer than either iv
technique, both in the current study and as reported
by others.7–9,12–14 in previous studies, where accelerated oral loading regimens were used (using doses
higher than those recommended by the manufacturer),
only in one were therapeutic concentrations achieved
faster than in the current study. the slower and
incomplete absorption that occurs with larger single
doses is presumably the result of the capacity-limited
absorption of phenytoin.6–9,13 in addition, some
authors have reported a higher incidence of ades
when using higher-than-recommended doses.7,8,11
to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first
to prospectively evaluate ades using three common
loading techniques of phenytoin in the nonseizing
ed patient. in the current study, po loading was
associated with a significantly lower incidence of
ades than either iv group. of five studies that have
directly compared ades from intravenous loading of
phenytoin and fosphenytoin, four have found significantly fewer ades using fosphenytoin,16,19–21
whereas one found no significant difference.22 our
study did not find a reduced incidence of ades using
fosphenytoin. in fact, the total number of ades was
greater in the ivf group, with the high incidence
of perineal pruritus counterbalancing the lower

incidence of pain and phlebitis at the infusion site.
moreover, perineal pruritus was not a trivial reaction
in the ivf group; it necessitated a reduction of the
infusion rate in many patients. perineal and generalized pruritus, as well as paresthesia, previously have
been reported with ivf infusions, with an incidence
as high as 64%. although the exact mechanism of this
ade is not clear, it appears to be related to the rate of
infusion, and often requires an interruption or slowing of the loading process.23
probably the most concerning ades that are
reported with intravenous phenytoin loading involve
hemodynamically significant cardiac events. because
of reports of adverse cardiovascular events with ivp, it
has been suggested that ivf loading is a safer choice for

a certain subset of patients, such as elders or those with
significant coronary artery disease.24,25 most reports of
adverse cardiovascular events are before the standardization of the maximum rate of ivp loading (not
greater than 50 mg/min).26–29 in our study, there were
only two minor, transient episodes of hypotension in
the ivp group and one minor episode of each
hypotension and sinus tachycardia in the ivf group.
the incidence and significance of serious soft-tissue
reactions such as purple glove syndrome are unclear.
the purple glove syndrome is defined as progressive
edema, discoloration, and pain in a distal extremity
following ivp loading. some authors have reported
an incidence of such reactions as high as 25.2% in
retrospective analyses, although there is no report of

this phenomenon before the introduction of ivf.30,31 a
large prospective study conducted in the ed setting
found no case among 279 consecutive loading doses
of ivp.22 we, likewise, found no case.
although five seizures occurred during the course
of the study, none was considered to be an ade,
because no patient seized secondarily to subtherapeutic phenytoin concentrations once loading was begun.
it is recognized that not all ades are the same;
some may be more costly or bothersome to patients
and caregivers. in the current study, many of the
ades in the po group were considered minor enough
that several patients in this arm were considered safe
for ed discharge despite the persistence of ades. for
the two iv groups, the comparison of the numbers of
changes to the infusion rate by the nursing staff may
give a more accurate reflection of the relative severity
of the ades recorded. from an ade perspective, it
appears difficult to justify the replacement of ivp with
ivf for routine loading in the nonseizing ed patient.
the analysis to determine which of the three loading
methods studied here is superior from a pharmacoeconomic point of view will be reported separately.
the average times to safe ed discharge were
calculated by determining the time at which therapeutic serum phenytoin concentrations were achieved
and the time at which there were no ades that
precluded ed discharge. however, in our study,
patients were not actually discharged at these times
because they remained for completion of the protocol.
the derived times most closely reflect actual practice.
patients loaded using the po technique may be
discharged before completion of the entire protocol
provided that therapeutic concentrations have been
achieved. in contrast, patients receiving iv phenytoin
must remain in the ed until the loading protocol is
finished, because patients are unable to complete iv
loading after discharge and also because measured
concentrations achieved during iv loading may be
transient and are less reflective of central nervous
system (cns) concentrations.

that although the patients were enrolled from the ed,
the actual loading took place in a separate research
ward. it is possible that administration of the loading
doses in a more controlled setting improved the
technique of loading and consequently decreased the
number of ades. however, this argument is counterbalanced by the previous finding that ades with ivp
are vastly underreported outside of controlled studies.32 we would not have been able to accurately
quantify the full range of ades without the use of
dedicated nursing staff.
the study was not blinded. blinding of either the
subjects or the investigators would have been difficult, if not impossible, because the three different
loading techniques involve different routes of administration, and different equipment is used to administer the loading doses in the two intravenous groups.
in addition, most ades encountered during the
loading process are specific to the technique used.
bias on the part of the investigators was minimized by
having the gcrc nursing staff record ades according to a standardized protocol.
there are other methods of loading phenytoin not
included in this trial. for example, we did not use
intramuscular fosphenytoin, which can be used when
intravenous access is not available. moreover, the
addition of benzodiazepines to the loading protocol
in patients who present with a recent seizure may further minimize the risk of a subsequent seizure before
attainment of therapeutic phenytoin concentrations.
although cns concentrations of phenytoin might
be a more accurate reflection of drug activity, these are
neither available nor practical in the clinical setting.
typically, approximately 10% of the total phenytoin
concentration is unbound (free fraction) and penetrates the cns to cause clinical effects. because the
major factor influencing the percentage of free
phenytoin is albumin concentration, patients with
hypoalbuminemia were excluded from this study,
ensuring that the serum concentrations approximate
those in the cns.

limitations

conclusions

one limitation of the current study may be a relatively
small sample size. another important limitation was

this study demonstrates that although therapeutic
concentrations are achieved more slowly using po

252
loading of phenytoin, po loading has fewer ades
than either ivp or ivf. the decision to use a po or iv
route, however, may involve several factors, including
the need to achieve therapeutic concentrations rapidly, the availability of resources in the ed, and the
cost of administration.
