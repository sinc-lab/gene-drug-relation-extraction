itamin a and its derivative retinoids play essential roles
in a variety of biological processes, including survival,
growth, reproduction, and resistance to infection (1, 2).
with the exception of vision in which the active intermediate of
 xxxd3105xxx  is 11-cis-retinal, all other functions of  xxxd3105xxx  are
mediated by  xxxd3417xxx  (atra)3 and 9-cis-retinoic
acid (9- xxxd2404xxx ) (3, 4).  xxxd3105xxx  and its derivatives have broad
regulatory functions in the immune system.  xxxd3105xxx -deficient
animals exhibit atrophy of the thymus and spleen, and  xxxd3105xxx 
deficiency in humans increases susceptibility to infections (5, 6).
in vitro studies also show that atra regulates lymphocyte function. for example, atra can inhibit the proliferation of both b
and t cells (7, 8). atra also inhibits apoptosis in t cell hybridomas (9, 10) and blocks negative selection when added to fetal
thymus organ culture (11). importantly, atra and its derivatives
inhibit inflammation and are widely used in clinical treatment of
acne (12, 13). the pleiotropic effects of retinoids are most likely
mediated by the tempospatial expression of different retinoid
receptors.

two families of nuclear receptors,  xxxd3417xxx  receptors
(rars) and retinoid x receptors (rxrs), act as retinoid receptors
(14). the rars (␣, ␤, ␥, and their isoforms) are activated by both
atra and 9- xxxd2404xxx , whereas the rxrs (␣, ␤, and ␥) are exclusively activated by 9- xxxd2404xxx  (4). rar␥, the third member of the
rar family, recognizes a direct repeat of aggtca separated by
2 or 5 nt and  xxxd3249xxx  as a heterodimer with members of the
rxr family (15). rar␥/rxr heterodimer binds to its responsive
element constitutively, and in the absence of atra it represses
transcription by recruiting corepressors (16). upon binding to
atra, rar␥/rxr dimer recruits coactivators and up-regulates
transcription of target genes. in addition to functioning as a coreceptor for rars, rxrs can also serve as heterodimeric partners
for other nuclear receptors such as thyroid hormone receptors,
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars), and nerve
growth factor-induced gene b (17). the level of complexity in the
formation of different types of retinoid receptors by rars and
rxrs in various cells suggests that individual rars or rxrs may
exert unique modulating function in the immune system.
to dissect the role of individual rars in transducing retinoid
signals in the immune system, we examined immune cell development and function in mice with rar␥ conditionally deleted in
hemopoietic cells. our experiments were designed to examine the
function of rar␥ under physiological or pharmacological levels
of retinoid acid stimulation. our data show that rar␥ is dispensable for the development of immune cells, but it is required for
cd8⫹ t cell ifn-␥ production and effector function in response to
listeria monocytogenes infection in vivo. unexpectedly, inflammatory cytokine production is impaired in rar␥-deficient macrophages. these data suggest that rar␥ plays a nonredundant role
in regulating inflammatory cytokine production in t lymphocytes
and macrophages.

 xxxd3105xxx  and its derivatives regulate a broad array of immune functions. the effects of these retinoids are mediated through
members of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) and retinoid x receptors. however, the role of individual retinoid receptors in the
pleiotropic effects of retinoids remains unclear. to dissect the role of these receptors in the immune system, we analyzed immune
cell development and function in mice conditionally lacking rar␥, the third member of the rar family. we show that rar␥
is dispensable for t and b lymphocyte development, the humoral immune response to a t-dependent ag and in vitro th cell
differentiation. however, rar␥-deficient mice had a defective primary and memory cd8ⴙ t cell response to listeria monocytogenes infection. unexpectedly, rar␥-deficient macrophages exhibited impaired inflammatory cytokine production upon tlr
stimulation. these results suggest that under physiological condition, rar␥ is a positive regulator of inflammatory cytokine
production. the journal of immunology, 2007, 178: 2113–2121.

rar␥ in t lymphocyte function and cytokine production

was digested with xbai and xhoi (new england biolabs) and probed,
as described (18). rar␥l/⫹vavcre and rar␥l/l mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice and used as controls in all of the experiments. all mice were fed regular diet ( xxxd3105xxx  sufficient), maintained
under specific pathogen-free conditions at duke university vivarium,
and used at 6 –12 wk of age. all experiments were performed according
to protocols approved by duke university animal care and use
committee.

rt-pcr and quantitative rt-pcr

flow cytometry
single-cell suspensions of the spleen, bm, thymus, and lymph nodes were
lysed of erythrocytes, incubated with an fcr blocker (2.4g2 supernatant),
and stained with fluorochrome-labeled mabs in pbs containing 2% fcs
and 0.02% sodium azide. the following abs directly conjugated to fitc,
pe, or pe/cy5 were used for flow cytometric analyses: cd3, cd4, cd8␣,
cd43, cd44, cd25,  xxxg1897xxx , tcr␤, tcr␥␦,  xxxg693xxx  (ly51), cd24 (heatstable ag), igm, igd, and ␣4␤7 integrin (datk), from bd pharmingen,
ebioscience, or biolegend. analyses were performed on a facscan
flow cytometer using cellquest software (bd biosciences). kbova-pe tetramers were provided by m. bevan (university of washington, seattle, wa).
for cell proliferation experiments, 200 ␮l of single-cell suspensions
from spleen at 106 cells/ml was stimulated in triplicates in complete rpmi
1640 medium (invitrogen life technologies) with 5 ␮g/ml  xxxd2676xxx 
(2c11) ab or 40 ␮g/ml anti-igm ab (mp biomedicals) for 72 h in the
presence or absence of 10 nm atra (sigma-aldrich). then the cells were
pulsed with 1 ␮ci of [3h]thymidine (ge healthcare). after 4 h, the cells
were harvested with a tomtec cell harvester (tomtec) onto fiberglass
filters (perkinelmer) and incubated with betaplate scint scintillation
liquid (perkinelmer wallac). the filters were read on microbeta trilux
(perkinelmer).
for the cell stimulation experiments, total splenocytes were stimulated
with 1 ␮g/ml  xxxd2676xxx  (2c11) ab in the presence or absence of 10 nm
atra (sigma-aldrich) for 2 days, washed, and cultured for 3 more days
in the presence of 100 u/ml human il-2 (hil-2; biolegend).

th1/th2 differentiation
cd4⫹ t cells were purified by depletion with a mixture of biotinylated abs
for  xxxg1897xxx , cd8, i-ab,  xxxg1208xxx , and  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx , followed by dynabeads m-280
streptavidin (invitrogen life technologies). the purity was typically above
88%. a total of 2 ⫻ 106 cd4⫹ t cells was incubated with the same number
of irradiated (3000 rad) t cell-depleted splenocytes on  xxxd2676xxx  (5 ␮g/
ml)-coated 24-well plates (bd biosciences) in the presence of 100 u/ml
hil-2. for th1 differentiation, anti-il-4 ab at 4 ␮g/ml (biolegend) and
il-12 at 5 ng/ml (peprotech) were added. for th2 differentiation, antiifn-␥ at 4 ␮g/ml (biolegend) and il-4 at 50 ng/ml (peprotech) were
added. after incubation at 37°c for 5 days, the live cells were isolated
by gradient centrifugation on lympholyte-m (cedarlane laboratories)
and activated on  xxxd2676xxx  (5 ␮g/ml) plus anti-cd28 (1 ␮g/ml)-coated
24-well plates overnight for cytokine production, as measured by
elisa or with pma (10 ng/ml) plus  xxxd2379xxx  (300 ng/ml) in the
presence of golgistop (bd pharmingen) for 5 h for intracellular cytokine staining.

cytokine assays
il-6 and tnf-␣ production was assayed with elisa kits (ebioscience).
il-12, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-13, and ifn-␥ production was determined by elisa
using the following pairs of abs: 2 ␮g/ml anti-il-12 capture ab with 1
␮g/ml biotin anti-il-12 ab (biolegend); 4 ␮g/ml anti-il-4 capture ab
(11b11) with 0.5 ␮g/ml biotin anti-il-4 ab (biolegend); 2 ␮g/ml anti- xxxg1180xxx 

pathogen infection, immunizations, and ab titration
the recombinant l. monocytogenes strain secreting chicken ova
(rlmova) was used to infect rar␥-deficient and control mice, as described (20, 21). to determine in vivo bacterial clearance after infection,
mice were infected with 2.8 ⫻ 105 cfu of salmonella typhimurium grown
in luria-bertani medium, 2 ⫻ 106 cfu of group b streptococcus (gbs)
grown in todd-hewitt medium (bd biosciences), or 3000 cfu of rlmova
resistant to erythromycin grown in brain-heart infusion medium (difco) containing 5 ␮g/ml erythromycin (sigma-aldrich). the correct titer of bacteria
was determined by spreading an aliquot of the inoculum. after 6 or 48 h, the
spleens were harvested and homogenized in 0.1% triton x-100 (shelton
scientific), and different dilutions were plated on luria-bertani agar plates for
s. typhimurium, blood agar (difco) for gbs, and brain-heart infusion agar
with 5 ␮g/ml erythromycin for l. monocytogenes.
mice were immunized i.p. with 100 ␮g (0.2 ml per mouse) of dnpkeyhole limpet hemocyanin (klh; calbiochem) mixed 1:1 with alum
(pierce). serum were collected, and isotype-specific anti-dnp abs were
determined by elisa, as described (20, 21). the titer was expressed as
relative units as compared with a master sample prepared by pooling aliquots from all samples.

cr release assay

to determine the ability of splenocytes to lyse ova257–264-loaded target
cells, 2-fold serial dilutions of splenocytes were prepared in triplicates in
96-well round-bottom plates. el-4 target cells were labeled with 250 ␮ci
of 51cr with or without 10⫺7 m ova257–264 peptide for 1 h at 37°c. the
target cells were then washed three times and added to effector cells at
10,000 cells/well. to determine the spontaneous and maximum lysis, target
cells were incubated without effector cells or lysed with 1% triton x-100
(shelton scientific). after 6 h of incubation at 37°c, the plates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min, and 50 ␮l of the supernatant was mixed
with 100 ␮l of optiphase supermix (perkinelmer) on 96-well isoplates
(perkinelmer). the samples were counted on microbeta trilux
(perkinelmer) to determine the amount of 51cr released in the supernatant.
the percentage of specific lysis was calculated as 100 ⫻ (experimental
cpm – spontaneous cpm)/(maximum cpm – spontaneous cpm).

intraepithelial lymphocyte (iel) isolation
iels were isolated from the small intestine after peyer’s patches removal.
the intestines were flushed with medium and cut into small pieces that
were stirred twice for 20 min at 37°c in 10% fbs in pbs with 20 mm
hepes and 0.1 mm edta. after vortexing, the pieces were allowed to
settle and the supernatants were filtered and spun down. the cells were
resuspended in 44% percoll (ge healthcare) and overlaid on 67% percoll
for 20 min spin at room temperature at 1700 rpm. the cells at the interphase were collected and washed, followed by 10-min incubation with fcr
block (2.4g2 supernatant) and staining with tcr␤ fitc, tcr␥␦ pe,  xxxd3027xxx  iodide, cd4 allophycocyanin, cd8␦ biotin, cd8␣ pe/cy7, and
cd45.2 allophycocyanin/cy7. the biotinylated abs were detected by
streptavidin-texas red (jackson immunoresearch laboratories).

macrophage stimulation
peritoneal macrophages were elicited by injection of 1 ml of 3% thioglycolate broth (difco) i.p. 3 days before the experiment. the cells were
recovered by peritoneal lavage with 2% fbs in pbs and let to adhere
overnight in 10-cm plates (bd biosciences). on the next day, the cells

lymphocyte populations from the thymus and spleen of c57bl/6 mice
were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (⬎99% pure), and total
rna from 1 ⫻ 106 cells was extracted with rneasy mini kit (qiagen).
first strand dna was reverse transcribed with iscript reverse transcriptase kit (bio-rad). quantitative and semiquantitative rt-pcr were performed with the following primers: rar␥ forward, 5⬘-tcc tcg ggt

tcg aaa cac; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase ( xxxg1075xxx ) forward, 5⬘-gat aca ggc cag act ttg ttg and reverse, 5⬘-ggt
agg ctg gcc tat agg ct. the quantitative rt-pcr was performed
in triplicates on lightcycler (roche). the mrna abundance of rar␥ was
calculated and normalized to  xxxg1075xxx  using relative expression software
tool provided by m. pfaffl (technical university of munich, munich,
germany).

capture ab with 1 ␮g/ml biotin anti- xxxg1180xxx  ab (biolegend); 1 ␮g/ml antiil-13 capture ab with 0.2 ␮g/ml biotin anti-il-13 ab (r&d systems); and
0.25 ␮g/ml anti-ifn-␥ capture ab with 1 ␮g/ml biotin anti-ifn-␥ ab
(biolegend). all biotinylated abs were detected with 1/1000 dilution of
streptavidin-hrp (ebioscience). the reactions were developed with tmb
peroxidase eia substrate kit (bio-rad).
for intracellular cytokine staining, the cells were first stained for surface
cd8 or cd4 and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 20 min
at 4°c. the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin (sigma-aldrich)
and stained with anti-ifn-␥ fitc (bd pharmingen) and/or anti-il-4 biotin
(biolegend) for 30 min at 4°c, followed by streptavidin-pe (molecular
probes, invitrogen life technologies) for 20 min at 4°c. the cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry.
for intracellular ifn-␥ staining in ag-specific cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ t cells,
4 ⫻ 106 splenocytes were cultured in 24-well plates in the presence of
golgistop (bd pharmingen) with either medium alone or 10⫺7 m
ova257–264 (american peptides) for cd8⫹ cells or 5 ␮m listeriolysin

were scraped and live cells were purified by gradient centrifugation on
lympholyte m (cedarlane laboratories). the cells were resuspended at
3 ⫻ 105/ml, and 0.5 ml was added to 48-well plates in triplicates. the cells
were stimulated with 100 ng/ml lps (sigma-aldrich), 10 ␮g/ml peptidoglycan (pgn) (invivogen), or 100 ␮g/ml poly(i:c) (sigma-aldrich)
overnight. the supernatants were collected and frozen at ⫺80°c until
assayed.

western blot
peritoneal macrophages were seeded at 106/ml in 1 ml in 24-well plates.
after 3 h, the medium was replaced with prewarmed medium containing 10
␮g/ml pgn (invivogen). at different time points, the cells were lysed with
100 ␮l of 1⫻ sds sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and stored at ⫺20°c
until assayed. the proteins were separated on 10% sds-page and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (perkinelmer). for immunoblot, anti- xxxg1366xxx , anti-perk (santa cruz biotechnology), anti-i␬b␣,
anti-pi␬b␣, anti-pjnk, and anti-pp38 (cell signaling technology) were
used. the secondary abs were anti-mouse and anti-rabbit-hrp conjugates
(jackson immunoresearch laboratories). the detection was achieved with
western pico substrate (pierce).

statistical analysis
the statistical analysis was performed using unpaired two-tailed student’s
t test using the graphpad prizm software (graphpad). values of p ⬍ 0.05
were considered statistically significant.

results

lated in developing t lymphocytes and suggest that rar␥ may
play a role in lymphocyte development and function.
conditional deletion of rar␥ in mouse hemopoietic cells
mice lacking rar␥ exhibit growth deficiency and early lethality
(22). to circumvent growth abnormalities that may indirectly affect lymphocyte development and function, we generated a mouse
strain that conditionally lacked rar␥ in all hemopoietic cells by
crossing mice with floxed exon 8 of rar␥ (rar␥l/l) to mice
expressing cre recombinase under the control of the vav promoter. the vav promoter drives cre expression in all hemopoietic
cells (19). southern blot analysis demonstrated that cre-induced
deletion of the floxed rar␥ alleles in the spleen and bm of
rar␥l/lvavcre mice was essentially complete (fig. 1b). to further determine the deletion efficiency, we performed semiquantitative rt-pcr for rar␥ mrna expression in the thymus, spleen,
and bm. rar␥ mrna expression in thymus of rar␥l/lvavcre
mice was reduced by ⬎98%, whereas its expression in spleen and
bm was reduced by ⬎99% (fig. 1c). the residual expression of
rar␥ mrna in rar␥l/lvavcre thymus, spleen, or bm may be
due to the presence of nonhemopoietic cells and/or cells escaping
deletion. nevertheless, these results demonstrated that rar␥ was
efficiently deleted in most hemopoietic cells.

regulated expression of rar␥ in developing t lymphocytes

t and b lymphocyte development in rar␥l/lvavcre mice

in a differential analysis of gene expression in developing t lymphocytes using dna microarrays, we found that rar␥ expression
was differentially regulated in cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ single-positive
(sp) thymocytes. cd8⫹ sp thymocytes expressed 2- to 3-fold
higher levels of rar␥ mrna than cd4⫹ sp thymocytes (data
not shown). we confirmed this result by quantitative real-time rtpcr (fig. 1a). rar␥ expression was at a low level in doublepositive (dp) thymocytes, but was up-regulated in sp thymocytes
(fig. 1a). the expression level of rar␥ mrna in cd8⫹ sp
thymocytes and cd8⫹ mature t cells from spleen and lymph
nodes was 50 –150% higher than that in their cd4⫹ counterparts
(fig. 1a). these data demonstrate that rar␥ expression is regu-

given that  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency in mice causes lymphoid organ
atrophy (6), and a recent report that rar␥ has important functions
in hemopoietic stem cell (23), we examined the development of t
and b lymphocytes in rar␥l/lvavcre mice. the total cellularity
of thymus and spleen in rar␥-deficient mice was similar to that
of control littermates (fig. 2 and data not shown). thymocyte development as defined by the expression of cd4 and cd8 markers
proceeded normally from double-negative (dn) through dp to
cd4 sp and cd8 sp cells in rar␥-deficient mice (fig. 2a). to
further characterize the early stages of t cell development in the
thymus, we stained dn thymocytes for cd44 and cd25 expression. we did not find obvious defects in dn1 (cd44⫹cd25⫺),

rar␥ in t lymphocyte function and cytokine production

dn2 (cd44⫹cd25⫹), dn3 (cd44⫺cd25⫹), and dn4 (cd44⫺
cd25⫺) cells (fig. 2a).
we next analyzed b cell development in the bm of rar␥deficient mice. the earliest stages of b cell development that are
characterized by cd43 and  xxxg1897xxx  expression can be subdivided
into fractions a, b, c, and c⬘ based on heat-stable ag and  xxxg693xxx 
expression (24). the more mature stages do not express cd43, but
still express  xxxg1897xxx . they can be divided into fractions d, e, and f
by igd and igm expression. b cell development at these different
stages in the bm of rar␥-deficient mice was comparable to that
in littermate controls (fig. 2b). furthermore, peripheral t and b
cell compartments in rar␥-mutant mice were apparently normal
(fig. 2c). taken together, these results demonstrate that rar␥ is
not essential for t and b lymphocyte development.
lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation in the absence
of rar␥
although high levels of  xxxd3417xxx  modulate lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation, it is not known which receptors are
used in these cells. some previous studies, using selective agonists
or antagonists, have suggested that  xxxd3417xxx  exerts its effects
on th1/th2 differentiation and expression of homing receptors
through rar␣ or rar␤ (25, 26). however, it is not clear what
role rar␥ may play in these processes, especially when retinoic
acid is at physiologic levels. to determine the role of rar␥ in
lymphocyte proliferation, we stimulated total splenocytes with anticd3 to activate t cells or with anti-igm to activate b cells and
assessed cell proliferation by [3h]thymidine incorporation. as

shown in fig. 3a, both t and b cells from rar␥-deficient mice
divided at the same rate as control cells. similar results were observed after 2 days of stimulation and after stimulation of t cells
with pma plus  xxxd2379xxx  or of b cells with lps (data not shown).
in agreement with previous studies (7, 8), the addition of atra to
the culture inhibited the proliferation of both t and b cells in
response to  xxxd2676xxx  and anti-igm (fig. 3a). importantly, the effects of atra on lymphocyte proliferation were still observed in
the absence of rar␥. these results demonstrate that rar␥ is not
required for the proliferation of t and b lymphocytes. furthermore, rar␥ is not essential for the antiproliferative action of high
concentration atra on lymphocytes.
given that atra can modulate th cell differentiation (25, 27),
we determined th cell differentiation in the absence of rar␥.
cd4⫹ t cells produced only ifn-␥, but not il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , or il-13
when cultured under th1 conditions, and produced il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and
il-13, but not ifn-␥ when cultured under th2 conditions (fig.
3b). the polarization of rar␥-deficient cd4⫹ t cells to th1 or
th2 lineage was not obviously impaired (fig. 3, b and c). these
results demonstrate that rar␥ deficiency did not result in impairment of in vitro cd4⫹ t cell differentiation.
humoral immune response in rar␥-deficient mice
we further examined the in vivo function of b cells and cd4⫹ th
cells in rar␥-deficient mice by testing the humoral immune response in these mice. rar␥l/lvavcre and control mice were immunized with the t-dependent ag dnp-klh and boosted 28 days

after the primary immunization. anti-dnp-specific abs were measured by elisa. the ag-specific abs were similarly detected in
rar␥l/lvavcre and control mice after primary and secondary
immunization (fig. 4), indicating that rar␥ is not essential for ig
secretion and class-switching by b cells.

cells to mount an immune response using a model pathogen,
rlmova (28). rar␥l/lvavcre and control mice were infected
with 10,000 cfu of rlmova, and 7 days later the cd8⫹ immune
response was evaluated by ifn-␥ production to ova257–264 peptide stimulation. in addition, ifn-␥ production by cd4⫹ t cells
specific for the llo190 –201 epitope was also examined. at the
peak of the primary immune response at day 7, the number of
ag-specific cd8⫹ cells in rar␥-deficient mice as determined by
ifn-␥ production was significantly decreased ( p ⫽ 0.0342) when

rar␥ in t lymphocyte function and cytokine production

compared with those in control mice (fig. 5a). in contrast, cd4⫹
t cell response to listeria infection was not impaired ( p ⫽ 0.304)
(fig. 5a). we further examined memory cd8⫹ t cell response in
rar␥-deficient mice by rechallenging the mice 42 days after the
primary infection. consistent with a decreased primary cd8⫹, but
not cd4⫹ t cell response, memory cd8⫹, but not cd4⫹, t cell
response in rar␥-deficient mice was impaired, as assessed by
either ifn-␥ ( p ⫽ 0.0489) or kb-ova tetramer ( p ⫽ 0.0289)
staining (fig. 5b). furthermore, the cytotoxicity of splenocytes
from immunized rar␥-deficient mice was significantly lower
than that of cells from control mice (fig. 5c). these results
demonstrate that the development of cd8⫹ effectors depends
on rar␥.
iel development in rar␥-deficient mice
a recent report showed that atra imprints gut-homing specificity on memory t cells (26). atra produced from gut dendritic
cells (dcs) stimulates t cells to express the gut-homing ␣4␤7 in-

tegrin. these t cells activated in the gut go into circulation and,
upon re-encounter of their cognate ag, home preferentially back to
the gut. we investigated whether atra-induced ␣4␤7 integrin
expression depends on rar␥.  xxxd2676xxx  stimulation of cd4⫹ and
cd8⫹ t cells up-regulated ␣4␤7 integrin expression, and this effect was further enhanced by atra (fig. 6a and data not shown).
up-regulation of ␣4␤7 integrin expression on rar␥-deficient
cd4⫹ or cd8⫹ t cells by  xxxd2676xxx  or  xxxd2676xxx  plus atra was
similar to that on control t cells (fig. 6a and data not shown),
indicating that rar␥ is not essential for the expression of guthoming receptors on t cells.
we further examined the gut lymphocyte compartment in
rar␥-deficient mice. the iels consist of both conventional
cd4⫹ tcr␣␤⫹ and cd8␣␤⫹ tcr␣␤⫹ t cells and several nonconventional t cell subsets. the most abundant of the latter are the
␥␦t cells, which comprise approximately half of iels. in addition,
there are also cd4⫹cd8⫹ tcr␣␤⫹ t cells, as well as cd8␣␣⫹
tcr␣␤⫹ t cells. as shown in fig. 6b, the percentages of
tcr␣␤⫹ and tcr␥␦⫹ iels were similar between control and
mutant mice. furthermore, iel subsets corresponding to cd4⫹
cd8⫺, cd4⫺cd8␣⫹, and cd4⫹cd8⫹ t cells were comparable
in rar␥-deficient and littermate control mice (fig. 6b). the absence of any effect of the rar␥ deficiency on the composition of
the iel compartment further indicates that rar␥ is dispensable
for the atra effect on t cell gut migration.

inflammatory cytokine production in rar␥-deficient
macrophages
atra and its derivatives are widely used in clinical treatment of
acne (12, 13), partly due to its inhibition of inflammatory cytokine
production. moreover, rar␥ is expressed in macrophages (29,
30), suggesting that atra may mediate its effect through rar␥.
we examined the role of rar␥ in inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. elicited peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with lps, pgn, or poly(i:c) in the presence or absence of
atra. the supernatants were assessed for the production of il-6,
il-12, and tnf-␣ by elisa. as expected, the addition of atra
decreased the production of most cytokines by 30 –50%, with the
exception of il-6 induced by pgn (fig. 7a). surprisingly, rar␥deficient macrophages exhibited defective production of il-6, il12, and tnf-␣ upon lps, pgn, and poly(i:c) stimulation (fig.
7a). moreover, the addition of atra further decreased the production of these inflammatory cytokines (fig. 7a). these findings
suggest that rar␥ is required for tlr ligand-induced inflammatory cytokine production, and that the anti-inflammatory action by
atra does not depend on rar␥.
to determine the basis for the decreased inflammatory cytokine
production in rar␥-deficient macrophages, we first examined
whether rar␥-deficient macrophages differ phenotypically from
their wild-type counterparts. no difference was found in their cell
size, granularity, and expression of the macrophage marker  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx 
between rar␥-deficient and control macrophages (fig. 7b and

data not shown). we also examined the expression of tlrs and
did not find any difference in the expression of tlr2 and 4 in
macrophages from rar␥-deficient and control mice (fig. 7b). we
then examined the signaling pathways in pathogen-associated molecular pattern-stimulated macrophages. as shown in fig. 7c, the
phosphorylation of i␬b␣, jnk, p38, and erk in rar␥-deficient
macrophages was largely comparable to that in control cells. these
results demonstrate that the membrane-proximal signaling events
were not obviously changed in rar␥-deficient macrophages and
suggest that rar␥ may exert its effect on inflammatory cytokine
production in the nucleus.
innate immune response in rar␥-deficient mice
to examine whether rar␥-deficient mice have defective innate
immune responses, we infected rar␥l/lvavcre mice with different bacterial pathogens, measured the amount of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum 2 h after the infection, and determined
the bacterial burden in the spleen after 48 h. we used g⫺ bacteria
s. typhimurium, g⫹ extracellular bacteria gbs, and g⫹ intracellular bacteria l. monocytogenes. because the preliminary experiments showed that gbs are rapidly cleared after infection, we
determined the bacterial burden of this microbe after 6 h. we did
not observe statistically significant differences ( p ⬎ 0.05) between
control and rar␥l/lvavcre mice in the number of viable bacteria
recovered from their spleens (fig. 8a) and the amount of il-12 or
il-6 in the serum (fig. 8b and data not shown). tnf-␣ was under

discussion
although it is well established that  xxxd3105xxx  and its derivatives
modulate immune responses and regulate lymphocyte function, its
receptor use in various immune cells is not clear. furthermore,
because higher than physiological levels of retinoid acids were
used in many of the in vitro studies, the outcome of interaction
between retinoid acids and their receptors in vivo remains unknown. to address these issues, we induced rar␥ deletion in
vivo and examined the development and function of lymphocytes
as well as the inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages
from rar␥-deficient mice. our results support two major conclusions, as follows: first, rar␥ is dispensable for the normal development of lymphocytes, but is required for cd8⫹ t effector differentiation and ifn-␥ production; second, rar␥ functions as a
positive regulator of proinflammatory cytokine production in
macrophages.
the expression of rar␥ mrna is tightly regulated during t
cell development. however, its ablation did not have any noticeable effects on thymocyte development. this is somewhat unexpected, because the expression of rar␥ under the control of the
lck promoter has been shown to increase the percentage of cd8
sp thymocytes (31). moreover, there is evidence that retinoids can
influence the process of negative selection (9 –11). the most likely
explanation for the lack of thymocyte abnormalities is that another
closely related molecule substitutes for rar␥ in its absence. the
best candidate is rar␣, which is closely related to rar␥ and is
ubiquitously expressed (32). rar␤ has not been detected in lymphocytes (33). in addition, our results also show that rar␥ is not
essential for lymphocyte proliferation and th cell differentiation in
vitro as well as cd4⫹ effector differentiation and ab production in
vivo. atra-induced integrin expression in t cells does not depend on rar␥. these results suggest that rar␣ and rxrs are
sufficient to compensate for the loss of rar␥ in vivo. alternatively, rar␥ may not be used temporally and spatially in these
processes. future studies using double deletion of rar␣ and
rar␥ in mice will address whether there is a redundancy of these
receptors in lymphocyte development and function.
our result demonstrated that the cd8⫹, but not cd4⫹ t cell
response was defective in rar␥l/lvavcre mice. this result is

consistent with the higher expression level of rar␥ in cd8⫹ than
cd4⫹ t cells. the lower number of cd8⫹ effector and memory t
cells in rar␥l/lvavcre mice after listeria infection may be due
to a role of rar␥ in activating ifn-␥ production. a bioinformatics search did not reveal rar␥ binding sites in the ifn-␥ promoter, suggesting that rar␥ regulates the expression of ifn-␥
indirectly. alternatively, the impaired cd8⫹ t effector and memory cell differentiation may be due to the lowered inflammatory
cytokine production by innate immune cells. this is unlikely because infections with s. typhimurium, gbs, and l. monocytogenes,
as well as in vivo administration of pgn did not result in a lowered
il-6 and il-12 production in rar␥l/lvavcre mice (fig. 8 and
our unpublished observations), suggesting that the production of
the inflammatory cytokines in cell types other than macrophages
does not depend on rar␥. in addition, the normal cd4⫹ response
and ab production in rar␥l/lvavcre mice further suggest that
the decreased production of ifn-␥ by cd8⫹ t cells is not due to
abnormalities in their innate immune system, but a separate defect.
thus, we favor a role of rar␥ in activating ifn-␥ production in
cd8⫹ t lymphocytes.
an unexpected finding from our study is the impaired inflammatory cytokine production by rar␥-deficient macrophages. this
result suggests that  xxxd3105xxx , at physiological levels in serum and
culture medium, engages rar␥ to activate il-6, il-12, and
tnf-␣ production. the mechanisms by which rar␥ regulates
these inflammatory cytokines are not clear. our data have ruled out
an effect of rar␥ on the proximal signaling upon tlr stimulation. like many other nuclear receptors, such as gr, ppars, and
liver x receptor (lxr) (34 –37), rar␥ may regulate the transcription of these cytokines by either direct binding to the regulatory
elements of these genes or indirect activation/inactivation of other
nuclear proteins. examination of the promoter regions of il-6,
il-12, and tnf-␣ did not reveal any obvious rar␥ binding sites,
suggesting an indirect role of rar␥.
our results also show that atra-mediated inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production by rar␥-deficient macrophages is
not impaired, suggesting that rar␥ is not required for the inhibitory function of atra. high levels of atra may activate other
retinoid acid receptor such as rxr and mediate its inhibitory function. the abilities of rxrs to suppress inflammation are well documented, and several mechanisms have been proposed. rxrs, for
example, can interact directly with nf-␬b and inhibit its activity
(38). in addition, rar␣ has been demonstrated to be a negative
regulator of ap-1-responsive genes (39). both ap-1 and nf-␬b

downloaded from http://www.jimmunol.org/ by guest on april 6, 2015

the detection limits in all cases. these data suggest that whereas
rar␥ plays important roles in regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages, its absence in vivo can be
compensated by other cellular components.

are critical for the expression of il-6, il-12, tnf-␣, and ifn-␥.
we speculate that rar␥ binding to rxrs can titrate out the inhibitory complexes in which rxrs participate (rar␣/rxr,
lxr/rxr, ppar/rxr) and alleviate the suppression of cytokine
transcription.
despite the impaired cytokine production by rar␥-deficient
macrophages, rar␥l/lvavcre mice had normal responses to bacterial infections. they cleared the pathogens at the same rates as
control mice, and surprisingly, produced similar amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. one possible explanation for the in vivo
results is that cell types other than macrophages do not depend on
rar␥ for their cytokine production. for example, il-6 can be
produced by a wide variety of cells (40), and it is possible that the
defect in macrophages can be masked by the normal production of
other cell types. similarly, macrophages are not the only source of
il-12 (41). neutrophils, astrocytes, and dcs can also produce il12. moreover, optimal production of il-12 by macrophages requires costimulation with ifn-␥ or il-4, whereas dcs do not need
additional stimuli. thus, it is possible that normal production of
il-12 by other cells in vivo effectively compensates for the defect
in macrophages.
