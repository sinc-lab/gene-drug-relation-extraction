 xxxd1798xxx , a humanized anti- xxxg1174xxx  alpha chain antibody, for treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease.   xxxd1798xxx , a humanized monoclonal igg1 directed against the alpha chain of the  xxxg1174xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ), is a competitive inhibitor of il-2 on activated lymphocytes. to test the hypothesis that specific inhibition of activated lymphocytes in patients with ongoing acute graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) might ameliorate the process, we treated 43 patients with advanced or steroid-refractory gvhd with  xxxd1798xxx . the first cohort of 24 patients was treated with  xxxd1798xxx  1 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. on day 43, the complete response (cr) rate was 29% (95% confidence interval [ci], 13%-51%). survival on day 120 was 29% (95% ci, 13%-51%). a second cohort of 19 patients was treated with  xxxd1798xxx  1 mg/kg on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22. for these patients, the cr rate on day 43 was 47% (95% ci, 24%-71%), and survival on day 120 was 53% (95% ci, 29%-76%). there were no infusion-related reactions and no serious side effects related to  xxxd1798xxx . following treatment, there was a reduction in serum concentrations of soluble  xxxg1175xxx  and peripheral blood cd3( + )25(+) lymphocytes, but these changes were not predictive of response.  xxxd1798xxx  has substantial activity for the treatment of acute gvhd, and the second regimen evaluated is recommended for a controlled study.
