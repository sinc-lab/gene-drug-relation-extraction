1. introduction

since prostaglandin
(pg) f,, was first identified as a substance that causes smooth
muscle contraction in swine lungs and rabbit iris, it has been well accepted that pgf,,
is involved in smooth muscle contraction in uterus, bronchus and trachea, gastrointestinal tract, and blood vessels (moncada et al., 1985; coleman et al., 1990). pgf,, also
induces dna synthesis and cell proliferation in quiescent swiss 3t3 cells (de asua et
al., 1975) and is involved in pain transmission in the central nervous system (minami et
al., 1992). of the various physiological
actions of pgf,, , the most well established
function of pgf,, is in luteal regression of the ovary through its binding to a specific
receptor on the luteal membrane (horton and poyser, 1976). although signal transducvia stimulation
of phosphoinositide
tion by pgf,,
involving
ca2+ mobilization
metabolism has been reported in many cell types including luteal cells, little was known
until recently about the molecular structure of the pgf,,
receptor. cdna clones for
pgf,, (fp) receptors have now been isolated independently
from cow, mouse, and
human cdna libraries (sakamoto et al., 1994; sugimoto et al., 1994; abramovitz et al.,
1994).

of a bovine

pgf,,

receptor

cdna

because the pgf,,
(fp) receptor protein is highly expressed in corpus luteum
(powell et al., 1975) and virtually all studies on pgf,,-specific
binding sites have been
conducted on fractions from corpora lutea, we used corpora luteal mrna to prepare a
cdna library. pcr screening was performed to identify a cdna fragment which
specifically appears in the corpora luteal cdna pool; degenerate primers designed from
common motifs of transmembrane
domains of known prostanoid receptors were used to
screen the library. a 230-bp pcr product, having a sequence homology with the txa,
receptor cdna, was isolated and utilized as a probe for cross hybridization. one clone,
bc2211, carrying a 2.2-kbp insert dna was finally isolated from bovine corpus luteal
cdna library. this clone encodes a protein of 362 amino acid residues with an
estimated molecular weight of 40 983. the hydropathy profile indicates that the deduced
amino acid sequence consists of seven hydrophobic
segments, representing
seven
potential transmembrane
helices, a structure common to known prostanoid receptors.
using the same hybridization
method, cdna clones for pgf,,
receptors were also
isolated from a pregnant mouse ovary cdna library (sugimoto et al., 1994) and a
human kidney cdna library (abramovitz et al., 1994). a rat pgf,, receptor cdna
was also identified by cross hybridization
using a mouse pgf,,
receptor as probe
(kitanaka et al., 1994).

the deduced amino acid sequences of pgf,,
receptors from different species are
aligned in fig. 1. the overall sequences are quite well conserved among these four
species. significant sequence homologies were observed in the transmembrane domains;
transmembrane
domain vii shows the highest homology among these species. in
contrast, the nh,-terminal
and cooh-terminal
regions show considerable
sequence
diversity. the nh,-terminal
region contains two potential n-glycosylation
sites, as
observed with other members of the g protein-coupled
receptor family. several serine
and threonine residues, potential phosphorylation
sites for protein kinase c, are commonly conserved in the cooh-terminal
region or in the second intracellular
loop.
arg-291, the 4th residue in transmembrane
segment vii, is well conserved among the
known prostanoid receptors including the tp, epl,  xxxg1873xxx , and ep3 and ip receptors.
based on studies of bovine rhodopsin (findlay and pappin, 19861, the most well
conserved regions of transmembrane
domain vii are expected to play a key role in
binding the ligand.
in order to elucidate the mechanisms of receptor-ligand interactions at the molecular
level, a model for the bovine pgf,, receptor was constructed on the basis of its amino
acid sequence, the known helical arrangement of bacteriorhodopsin,
and a model of the
human txa, receptor (yamamoto et al., 1993). as shown in fig. 2, the ligand binding
pocket of the pgf,,
receptor includes arg-291 and a large hydrophobic pocket. the
carboxylic acid group of pgfzu may interact with arg-291, and the c-9 and c-l i
hydroxyl groups of pgf,,
may interact with ser and thr residues in transmembrane
domains iii and vii, respectively.
sequence comparisons revealed significant homologies between pgf,, receptor and
other members of the prostanoid receptor family. the bovine pgf,. receptor shares 34
and 33% amino acid sequence homologies with human and mouse txa, receptors,
respectively. similar homologies are observed with bovine and mouse ep3 receptors (3 1
and 32% homology, respectively). these sequence homologies are mostly localized to
the transmembrane
domains, particularly domain vii.

3. signal transduction

by the bovine pgf,,

receptor

in order to determine the binding specificity of the cloned pgf,,
receptor, we
cxamincd the ligand-binding
properties of the receptor in membranes from cho cells
(cho-pgf,,)
which stably express the receptor. scatchard analyses indicated the
presence of a single binding site with a k, value of 25.2 nm. the binding of
[ 3h]pgf, a was inhibited by unlabeled pgs in the order of pgf,, 2 9cu, 11 p-pgf, >
pgdz > pge, > sta, (a stable txa, agonist). these ligand binding characteristics
are in good agreement with those reported previously for the pgf,,
receptor from
is known to stimulate phosphoinositide
corpora lutea of various species. as pgf,.
metabolism,
we examined intracellular
signal transduction
mediated by the pgf,,
receptor in cho-pgf, a cells (ito et al., 1994). when cho-pgf,,
cells labeled with
nzq’n-[‘hlinositol were stimulated with 1 pm pgf,,, a small but significant increase in
[3h]insp, formation was observed at 30 s, and this elevated level of [“h]insp, continued
over a io min experimental
period. pretreatment of cho-pgf,,
cells with pertussis

that the pgf,, receptor is coupled to phosphoinositide
metabolism in cho cells via gq.

4. expression

analysis

of pgf,,

receptor

mrna

northern blot analyses have shown that a 5-kb mrna for the bovine pgf,, receptor
is abundantly
expressed in corpus luteum, but is not detectable in other organs
examined. rt-pcr analysis revealed a low level of pgf,, receptor expression in many
bovine tissues in the order of ovary devoid of corpus luteum > uterus > lung > small
intestine. in situ hybridization
showed that the great majority of hybridized signals are
associated with large luteal cells in the corpus luteum, but not detectable in other
constituent cells in the ovary (fig. 3). this study clearly demonstrates that the mrna
for the pgf,, receptor is specifically expressed in luteal cells and supports the idea that
prostanoid-induced
luteolysis is mediated via the pgf,, receptor.
in order to begin elucidating the regulation of expression of the pgf,, receptor gene,
the level of pgf,,
receptor mrna was quantified in bovine corpora lutea taken at
different stages of the estrous cycle and during pregnancy and compared with the
numbers of [ 3h]pgf, a binding sites. northern blot analysis demonstrated that expression of pgf,,
receptor mrna progressively
increased during the estrous cycle, and

410

k. sakamoto et al./ j. lipid mediators cell signalling 12 (1995) 405-411

was markedly reduced upon luteal regression. although a constant level of pgf,,
receptor mrna was observed in early and middle pregnant corpora lutea, the level of
mrna was significantly
reduced during late pregnancy. in situ hybridization
and
binding studies agree with these data, consistent with the involvement
of pgf,,
in
luteolysis being regulated by pgf,, receptor mrna expression.
although the consequences of pgfz li induced-luteolysis
are well known, the molecular mechanisms that lead to luteolysis are virtually unknown. it has been believed that
granulosa cell death during ovarian follicular atresia (tilly et al., 1991; hughes and
gorospe, 1991) and luteal regression in cattle (juengel et al., 1993) occur by apoptosis.
the successful cloning of functional cdna for pgf,, receptor has provided information about receptor structure. the availability of specific cdnas for pgf,, receptors
should facilitate studies on the molecular mechanisms of receptor function.
