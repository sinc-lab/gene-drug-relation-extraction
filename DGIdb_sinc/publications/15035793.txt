abstract—paracetamol and salicylate are weak inhibitors of both isolated  xxxg1883xxx  (cox1) and cox-2 but are potent inhibitors of prostaglandin (pg) synthesis in intact cells if low
concentrations of  xxxd208xxx  are available. the effects of both drugs are overcome by increased
levels of hydroperoxides. at low concentrations of  xxxd208xxx , cox-2 is the major isoenzyme
involved in pg synthesis when both cox-1 and cox-2 are present in cells. therefore, paracetamol
and salicylate may selectively inhibit pg synthesis involving cox-2 because the lower  ux through
this pathway produces lesser levels of the hydroperoxide, pgg2 , than the pathway involving cox-1.
apart from the lack of anti-in ammatory effect of paracetamol in rheumatoid arthritis, the clinical
effects of paracetamol and salicylate are very similar and resemble those of the selective cox-2
inhibitors. a splice variant of cox-1, termed cox-3, may be a site of action of these drugs but,
further work, particularly at low concentrations of  xxxd208xxx  is required. we suggest that
paracetamol, salicylate and, possibly, the pyrazolone drugs, such as  xxxd1915xxx , may represent a distinct
class of atypical nsaids which could be termed peroxide sensitive analgesic and antipyretic drugs
(psaads).
key words: paracetamol; acetaminophen; salicylate;  xxxd1915xxx ; prostaglandin; cox-1; cox-2; cox3; peroxidase.

1. introduction

paracetamol and salicylate have analgesic and antipyretic effects which resemble
those of the nsaids. they are weakly anti-in ammatory at analgesic and
antipyretic doses and are stated widely to be weak inhibitors of prostaglandin (pg)
synthesis and therefore must have other mechanisms of action. this conclusion is
not supported by critical examination of the literature. our analysis indicates that
these drugs have a strikingly similar pharmacological pro le and that they are potent

inhibitors of pg synthesis in intact cells under some conditions. furthermore, they
appear to have a common mechanism of action which differs from those of the
classical nsaids and may represent a distinct class of nsaid. the pyrazolones
may be members of this class but data are limited.
paracetamol is, of course, a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent. salicylate salts have been administered in the past as analgesics, antipyretics and antiin ammatory drugs, but the present clinical interest in salicylate is very largely
because it is an active metabolite of aspirin. thus, the activity of aspirin is due
both to aspirin and its metabolite, salicylate. the pyrazolones, such as  xxxd192xxx 
( xxxd192xxx ),  xxxd1915xxx  and aminopyrine are little used although  xxxd1915xxx  is available in some countries.  xxxd1915xxx  is not absorbed intact and its activity is very
largely due to its immediate metabolite, methylaminoantipyrine.

2. therapeutic concentrations of paracetamol and
salicylate

for paracetamol, the therapeutic concentrations are of the order of 10 to 100 ¹m.
this approximate range is based  rstly on the plasma concentration of paracetamol (22 ¹m) which is associated with 50% of maximal analgesic effect in children
undergoing tonsillectomy (anderson et al., 1999). secondly, peak plasma concentrations after oral dosage of rapidly absorbed formulations are about 100 to 200
¹m although the peak tissue concentrations, for example in cerebrospinal  uid, are
about 50% of the peak values (bannwarth et al., 1992). paracetamol is not bound
to plasma proteins and such binding does not have to be considered.
the therapeutic plasma concentrations for the anti-in ammatory effect of salicylate are commonly quoted as 1.1 to 2.2 ¹m. the binding to plasma proteins is
saturable and the corresponding unbound concentrations are approximately 140 to
500 ¹m (shen et al., 1991). analgesia is, however, produced by lower plasma concentrations of salicylate. for example, a 1-g dose of  xxxd3219xxx  is analgesic
and produces peak plasma concentrations of unbound salicylate of about 50 ¹m
(graham et al., 1976). even lower concentrations may lead to analgesia.

3. relevant enzymology of pg synthesis

the dual actions of  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) and cox-2 are important considerations in any discussion of the effects of paracetamol and related drugs. both cox1 and cox-2 catalyze the production of pgg2 from the most common substrate,
 xxxd208xxx , which is liberated from phospholipid by the activity of cpla2 -®.
this reaction is catalyzed by the cyclooxygenase activity of the enzymes. the peroxidase function of the enzymes then converts pgg2 to pgh2 which is the branch
point for the formation of the various prostanoids such as pge2, prostacyclin and
thromboxane a2 . thus, speci c enzymes catalyse the formation of these various

mechanisms of action of paracetamol and related analgesics

403

prostanoids from the common intermediate, pgh2 . cox-1 and cox-2 are very
similar in structure. their peroxidase functions and active sites are closely related
to that of myeloperoxidase, the neutrophil enzyme which catalyzes the formation
of hypochlorous acid (smith and song, 2002). both cox-1 and myeloperoxidase
metabolize paracetamol to reactive oxidized species and it is likely that cox-2 oxidises paracetamol similarly (graham et al., 1999).
the synthesis of pgs appears to be compartmentalised (murakami et al., 2000).
according to this scheme, low concentrations of  xxxd208xxx , either available
extracellularly or released from phospholipid by cpla2 -®, are largely converted
to pgh2 by cox-2 when both isoenzymes are present in the cell. the intermediate, pgh2 , is then converted to pge2 by membrane associated pge synthase
(murakami et al., 2000). this is called the delayed response because this pathway requires induction by cytokines in in ammatory cells although it is likely to
be constitutive in cells of the central nervous system. by contrast, the immediate
system utilises cox-1 and cytosolic pge synthase when high concentrations of
 xxxd208xxx  are available, either through high concentrations of exogenous material or by “explosive” activation of  xxxg1763xxx -® (cpla2-®) by
calcium ionophore (murakami et al., 2000). this scheme has been developed from
macrophages and its general validity remains to be established.
4. inhibition of pg synthesis by paracetamol

paracetamol is a weak inhibitor of pg synthesis in tissue homogenates or on puri ed
cox-1 or cox-2. yet, the effects of paracetamol are in vivo generally consistent
with inhibition of pg synthesis and, in particular, with selective inhibition of cox-2
(table 1). how can these contrasting results be reconciled? in summary, the effects
of paracetamol on pg synthesis are:
(i) we and several others have shown that paracetamol can be a potent inhibitor
of pg synthesis in intact cells (table 2). paracetamol is most potent when

the pgs are synthesized from low concentrations of added  xxxd208xxx 
or following activation of the delayed pathway by cytokines. according to
the model of murakami et al. (2000), cox-2 is the major cox isoenzyme
involved in pg synthesis under these conditions. the ic50 values of
paracetamol are often below 10 ¹m, well within the therapeutic range of
plasma concentrations.
calcium-ionophore-induced pg synthesis in intact cells is less potently
inhibited by paracetamol although the ic50 is just within the therapeutic range
(table 2).
the effect of paracetamol on pg production by intact cells is, in general,
weakly inhibitory when the concentration of exogenous  xxxd208xxx  is
greater than about 5 ¹m (fig. 1 and table 2).
the potent effect of paracetamol on intact endothelial cells is overcome by
t-butyl hydroperoxide (boutaud et al., 2002; table 2).
paracetamol has a biphasic activity on pg synthesis in broken cell preparations, producing stimulation at low concentrations with lesser stimulation at
higher concentrations. this effect is shown by many other phenols which,
like paracetamol, inhibit pg production by intact cells (graham et al., 2001).

(vi) paracetamol is a weak inhibitor of puri ed preparations of both cox-1 and
cox-2 (boutaud et al., 2002). the inhibitory effect of a supratherapeutic
concentration of paracetamol (0.5 mm) on isolated cox-1 is decreased by
the addition of the intermediate hydroperoxide, pgg2 . consistent with this

406

g. g. graham and k. f. scott

 nding, the hydroperoxide, 12-hpete, also decreases the activity of 1 mm
paracetamol on both cox-1 and cox-2. one critical point has, however,
been overlooked in this and many other studies on paracetamol. this is
that these preparations of cox-1 and cox-2 include a high concentration
of phenol (0.5 mm). considering that phenol and paracetamol have similar
(graham et al., 2001), if not identical, effects on cox-1 and cox-2
makes the results of these experiments per se very dif cult to extrapolate
to meaningful biological situations.
(vii) paracetamol is a more potent inhibitor of isolated cox-1 and cox-2
when peroxides are lowered by the addition of glutathione and glutathione
peroxidase. ouellet and percival (2001) found that this technique reduced
the ic50 of paracetamol on cox-1 and cox-2, although only its ic50 on
cox-1 was reduced to within the therapeutic range. it is notable this study
was conducted in the absence of another phenol.
(viii) the two electron oxidation product of paracetamol, n-acetyl- xxxd309xxx 
imine (napqi) is formed by cytochrome p -450 and the peroxidase function
of cox-1 (see above) but does not inhibit isolated cox-1 or cox-2 (ouellet and percival, 2001). however, there has been no test of the effect of the
intermediate reactive species formed in association with napqi.
(ix) it is suggested that paracetamol is selective for a cox-1 variant which has
been termed cox-3 (chandrasekharan et al., 2002). this variant from
dog brain was transfected into the insect cells and the production of pge2
measured after the addition of 5 ¹m or 30 ¹m  xxxd208xxx . after the
addition of 5 ¹m  xxxd208xxx , paracetamol was a marginally more potent
inhibitor of pg synthesis in the insect cells containing the variant cox-1 than
in cells containing mouse cox-1 and much more potent in cells containing
mouse cox-2 (table 2). at 30 ¹m  xxxd208xxx , the inhibitory potency
of paracetamol was substantially reduced in cells containing cox-3 and
eliminated in cells containing cox-1 and cox-2. cells containing cox3 were also more sensitive to phenacetin, an old pro-drug of paracetamol,
and to  xxxd1915xxx , a pyrazolone (see below).
overall, the critical  nding is that paracetamol is a potent inhibitor of pg synthesis
in intact cells when cox-2 should be the dominant isoenzyme involved. furthermore, the effects of changing peroxide tone on the potency of paracetamol, on isolated cox isoenzymes and in intact cells, are always in the same direction despite
the concerns about the relevance of much of the work on paracetamol on cell free
systems (see point (vi) above). increasing peroxide tone, either directly by the addition of hydroperoxides or indirectly by increasing the concentrations of arachidonic
acid, causes decreased inhibition by paracetamol.
the  nding with cox-3 indicates that a cox present in the central nervous
system may be a site of the action of paracetamol; however there are still puzzling
aspects of this work. a major problem is the insensitivity of cells containing cox-2.

407

it will be interesting to see further work with this system, particularly at lower levels
of  xxxd208xxx  or following stimulation by cpla-®.

5. inhibition of pg synthesis by salicylate

the mode of action of salicylate has become clearer since the  ndings of mitchell
et al. (1997). they found that salicylate potently decreased pg synthesis when
the concentration of exogenous  xxxd208xxx  was low (fig. 2). this result
on intact cells is in marked contrast to the common statement that salicylate is a
weak inhibitor of pg synthesis. this weak activity of salicylate has been accepted
widely since the seminal work of vane (1971), who found that nsaids inhibited
the production of pgs in a broken cell preparation. recent work has con rmed
that salicylate is, like paracetamol, a weak inhibitor of puri ed cox-1 and cox-2
(mitchell et al., 1997; aronoff et al., 2003). under the conditions used by aronoff
et al. (2003), salicylate inhibited both cox-1 or cox-2 with ic50 values about 700
¹m, above the maximal anti-in ammatory concentrations in vivo. again, as is the
case with paracetamol, the effects of high concentrations of salicylate on isolated
cox-1 and cox-2 are decreased by increasing peroxide levels (fig. 3). however,
the preparations of the puri ed isoenzymes contained phenol which is worrisome

figure 2. effect of salicylate on the synthesis of pge2 by an epithelial cell line in the absence and
presence of 30 ¹m  xxxd208xxx . the cells were activated by il-1¯. the production of pge2 was
higher in the presence of 1 and 10 ¹m  xxxd208xxx  (aa) than in the absence of exogenous aa
but the relationships between the concentration of salicylate and its effect (measured as % of control)
were very similar. the therapeutic (unbound) concentrations of salicylate range from about 50 ¹m
(analgesic effect) to approximately 140 to 500 ¹m (anti-in ammatory effect). figure redrawn from
the data of mitchell et al. (1997).

figure 3. effect of salicylate on the activity of isolated cox-2 in the absence and presence of the
hydroperoxide, hpete. the incubations contained 500 ¹m phenol and 0.5 ¹m  xxxd208xxx .
similar results were obtained with cox-1 although hpete produced complete antagonism of the
effects of salicylate in this case. lesser effects of 2000 ¹m salicylate were seen with increasing
concentrations of  xxxd208xxx  or cox-2. concentrations of salicylate above 500 ¹m are
supratherapeutic (see legend to fig. 2). figure redrawn from the data of aronoff et al. (2003).

because of possible interactions between phenol and salicylate as outlined above
when considering the effects of paracetamol in cell free systems.
despite the concern about the in uence of phenol on responses to salicylate and
the requirement for supratherapeutic concentrations of salicylate, the antagonistic
effect of peroxides may parallel the decreased response in intact cells when the
concentration of  xxxd208xxx  is increased.

6. apparent cox-2 selectivity of paracetamol and salicylate

the pharmacological effects of paracetamol and salicylate are largely consistent
with those of the selective cox-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib and rofecoxib
(table 1). this selectivity by paracetamol and salicylate is not shown with isolated
cox-1 or cox-2. the apparent cox-2 selectivity of paracetamol and salicylate
arises from the in uence of peroxides on the potency of these two drugs. firstly,
it is possible that pathways of pg synthesis involving cox-2 proceed at a slower
rate that processes involving cox-1 in intact cells. the lower levels of pgg2 then
may lead to more potent inhibition by paracetamol and salicylate. furthermore, as
outlined above, the pathway involving cox-2 is more signi cant at low rates of
pg synthesis. it therefore follows that, in intact cells, paracetamol and salicylate
may selectively inhibit pg synthesis involving cox-2 (graham et al., 2001), not
because these drugs are inherently more selective for the enzymes in the cox-2

mechanisms of action of paracetamol and related analgesics

409

but, rather, because the lower  ux through this pathway leads to greater effects of
these drugs.
both salicylate and paracetamol have been reported to down-regulate the levels
of cox isoenzymes (wu et al., 1991; xu et al., 1999). however, inhibition of
pg synthesis by both paracetamol and salicylate can occur without any effect on the
expression of cox-1 and cox-2 (graham et al., 2001; giuliano et al., 2001; greco
et al., 2003; mitchell et al., 1997).
we suggest that paracetamol and salicylate have their primary effects on the
synthesis of pgs although it is highly likely, like the selective cox-2 inhibitors, that
they interact with serotonergic systems to produce their analgesic and antipyretic
actions (pelissier et al., 1996; sandrini et al., 2002).

7. pyrazolones

several pyrazolone derivatives have been used clinically.  xxxd192xxx  ( xxxd192xxx )
and aminopyrine were widely used as analgesics and antipyretics but are widely
stated to be weak anti-in ammatory agents. the pyrazolones have largely been
removed because of the risk or perceived risk of blood dyscrasias.  xxxd192xxx 
was also unpopular because of its appalling taste.  xxxd192xxx  has been used for
many years as a marker of hepatic cytochrome p -450 isoenzymes. its volume of
distribution closely approximates total body water and it was used to determine this
anatomical parameter. the effects of the pyrazolones on the synthesis of prostanoids
have been studied in less detail than those of the paracetamol and salicylate and
their mechanism of action is not as clear as other nsaids or even paracetamol and
salicylate.
there is very little data on the effect of  xxxd192xxx  on cox-1 or cox-2. its ic50
value on cox-1 in a cell free system is about 5 mm (cohen et al., 1985), well above
therapeutic plasma concentrations.
the only pyrazolone which is used currently is  xxxd1915xxx  which is a prodrug. only
its immediate metabolite, methylaminopyrine, and further metabolites are present
in plasma. although,  xxxd1915xxx  is a prodrug, it has been used in in vitro experiments
but methylaminopyrine should be used in order to eliminate confusion about the
mechanism of action of the parent drug.
as is the case with paracetamol and salicylate, methylaminoantipyrine is generally
a less potent inhibitor of the synthesis of prostanoids in broken cell preparations
than intact cells. ic50 values in broken cell preparations have ranged from 100
and 800 ¹m (weithmann and alpermann, 1985) and 500 ¹m (szczeklik et al.,
1977). by comparison, ic50 values in intact cells stimulated with calcium ionophore
a23187 are about 100 ¹m (lanz et al., 1986). the concentrations of unbound
methylaminoantipyrine during dosage of 3 g daily are even lower at about 30
¹m (levy et al., 1995). possibly, the ic50 values are lower in intact cells
utilizing endogenous  xxxd208xxx , as is the case with paracetamol and salicylate

(tables 2 and 3). again like paracetamol, the parent drug,  xxxd1915xxx , inhibits cox3 in insect cells to a greater extent than in cells containing cox-1 or cox-3 but
further work is required to determine the relevance of this result.
in vivo,  xxxd1915xxx  shows some selectivity in the stomach. thus, at doses of 1 and
1.5 g daily,  xxxd1915xxx  does not damage the upper gastrointestinal tract, but is damaging at 3 g daily (bianchi porro et al., 1996). on the other hand, methylaminopyrine
commonly induces asthma in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics (szczeklik et al., 1977).
this is in contrast to paracetamol and salicylate which precipitate asthma to a much
lesser extent than aspirin (table 1).
8. conclusions

paracetamol and salicylate may be regarded as prototype atypical nsaids. present
data is incomplete but they appear to be:
(i) weak and non-selective inhibitors of cox-1 and cox-2 in broken cell
preparations;
(ii) potent inhibitors of pg synthesis by intact cells when cox-2 is the major
isoenzyme involved and when the levels of  xxxd208xxx  and the intermediate, pgg2 , are low;
(iii) analgesic and antipyretic agents at low doses with but anti-in ammatory drugs
at higher doses;
(iv) possible selective inhibitors of cox-3 variant which is a variant of cox-1.

 xxxd1915xxx , through its active metabolite, methylaminoantipyrine, may fall into the
same category of atypical nsaids but insuf cient data has been obtained.
much has been made of the lack of anti-in ammatory effect of paracetamol
in rheumatoid arthritis. however, it does have some anti-in ammatory activity
(table 1) and its lack of anti-in ammatory activity in rheumatoid arthritis may be
due to its low potency under conditions of high peroxide tone prevalent in severe
chronic in ammation. thus, it may not attain an anti-in ammatory effect at doses
which are not hepatotoxic.
