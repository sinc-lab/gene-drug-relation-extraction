review

maois in the contemporary treatment
of depression
michael e. thase, m.d., madhukar h. trivedi, m.d., and a. john rush, m.d.

we review the literature on the effectiveness of the
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) and present
metaanalyses of controlled trials comparing the fdaapproved maois with both placebo and comparator
tricyclic antidepressants. for outpatients, metaanalyses
with intent-to-treat samples revealed generally comparable
overall efficacy for phenelzine,  xxxd2389xxx , and
tranylcypromine. drug-placebo differences were 29. 5%
(± 11.1%) (phenelzine; nine studies), 41.3% (±18.0%)
( xxxd2389xxx ; three studies), and 22.1 % ( ± 25.4%)
(tranylcypromine; three studies). for inpatients,
phenelzine was 22.3% ( ± 30. 7%) (five studies) more
effective than placebo, whereas the  xxxd2389xxx -placebo
difference was lower (15.3%) ( ± 12.6%). both phenelzine
and  xxxd2389xxx  were significantly less effective than

comparator tricyclics for inpatients, whereas
tranylcypromine has not been adequately studied. both
phenelzine and tranylcypromine appear to be more
effective than tricyclics in depressed outpatients with
atypical features. monoamine oxidase inhibitors are also
effective treatments for outpatients who have failed to
respond to tricyclic antidepressants. our review also
suggests (1) the fda-approved mao!s treat a somewhat
different group of patients than tricyclics; (2) more
severely depressed inpatients may not respond as well to
mao is as to tricyclics; and (3) because of preferential
mao! responsivity, atypical or anergic depressions may
be biologically different than classical depressions.

approved for the treatment of depression in the united
states by the food and drug administration (fda). following a brief overview of the clinical pharmacology
of the maois, we examine their efficacy as acute and
maintenance phase treatments using metaanalysis.
efficacy is determined with respect to placebo-control
(pbo) and relative to standard tricyclic antidepressant
(tca) comparators. the relationship of response to degree of platelet mao inhibition is considered, as are
the side effects, tolerability, and safety of these agents.
finally, the literature on proposed maoi-responsive
subforms of depression is summarized.

key words:

monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) antidepressants
have been in use for nearly 40 years (ayd 1957; crane
1957; kline 1958; west and dally 1959; sargent 1961),
during which time their popularity has waxed and
waned (e.g., quitkin et al. 1979; paykel and white
1989). recently, they have been largely viewed as
second- or third-line antidepressant medications

(phz) (nardil),  xxxd2389xxx  (iso) ( xxxd2389xxx ), tranylcypromine sulfate (trp) (parnate), and selegiline hydrochloride (sel) (eldepryl). however, sel's approval
is limited to the treatment of parkinson's disease, and
a recent decision by the manufacturer of iso may remove it from the market. a fifth maoi,  xxxd2850xxx  ( xxxd2850xxx ), was approved for use in severe hypertension
but is no longer being manufactured because of an unfavorable risk-bene&t ratio in comparison with newer
antihypertensive agents. two additional maoi antidepressants, moclobemide and brofaromine, are approved for use in europe and/or canada, but are not
being studied for approval in the united states (thase
in press). nevertheless, these drugs appear to be effective antidepressants when compared to either pbo or
standard comparators (e.g., norman et al. 1985; lecrubier and guel& 1990; larsen et al. 1991; nolen et al.
1993; volz et al. 1994). another maoi,  xxxd1730xxx , also
appears to have significant antidepressant activity (e.g.,
potter et al. 1982). however, because of both proprietary and side-effect issues,  xxxd1730xxx  is not under active investigation at this time.
monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be classified by
their chemical structure (hydrazine versus nonhydrazine), by their relative selectivity for subforms of mao
(type a, type b, or mixed), or by the degree of affinity
to enzyme inhibition sites (i.e., reversible versus functionally irreversible) {klein and davis 1969; mann et al.
1984; murphy et al. 1984). the type b mao, found in
brain, platelets, and elsewhere, has substrate specificity
for phenethylamine and dopamine. type a mao,
found in the brain, gut, and liver (but not platelets) is
relatively substrate-specific for norepinephrine, serotonin, and tyramine (mann et al. 1984; murphy et al.
1984, 1987).
 xxxd2850xxx  was the first fda-approved maoi to be
considered relatively selective for type b mao (murphy et al. 1984). type b enzymatic selectivity was originally considered desirable as a solution to the dietary
restrictions necessitated by inhibition of tyramine metabolism. however, appropriately designed doseresponse studies regarding  xxxd2850xxx 's enzymatic selectivity were not performed in humans, and  xxxd2850xxx 
did not show much promise as an antidepressant (murphy et al. 1987). selegiline hydrochloride is also a selective inhibitor of type b mao at low doses (i.e., 5 to
10 mg/day) (mann et al. 1984). however, there is little
evidence to suggest that sel is an effective antidepressant at these doses (e.g., quitkin et al. 1984; mann et
al. 1989). in fact, sel appears to lose its specificity for
mao-b inhibition at the very dosages at which it surpasses pbo as an effective antidepressant (quitkin et
al. 1984; mann et al. 1989). this suggests that type a
mao may be more critical in the pathophysiology of
depression and/or more central to antidepressant activity than type b.  xxxd1730xxx , moclobemide, and

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

brofaromine are selective for type a maoi. the remaining three fda-approved maois are "mixed" inhibitors, because they inhibit both type a and type
b enzymes even at lower dosages.
 xxxd1730xxx ,  xxxd2850xxx , and the four fda-approved
maois are relatively irreversible, meaning that the
drugs bind tightly to the enzyme for the life of the enzyme. a minimum period of 7 to 14 days is needed to
adequately "wash out" mao inhibition caused by the
irreversible maois. not surprisingly, the clinical effects
of the irreversible maois may persist for days or even
several weeks after discontinuation (murphy et al.
1987). by contrast, clinical effects that are plasma-level
dependent (e.g., orthostasis) may reverse within hours
to a few days of drug discontinuation (murphy et al.
1987; robinson and kurtz 1987; mallinger and smith
1991). the newer type-a selective maois, moclobemide and brofaromine, are reversible and thus have a
shorter duration of effects on enzyme inhibition (moller
et al. 1991; roth and guelfi 1992). whereas drug plasma
levels of both the reversible and irreversible mao is can
be measured using methodology analogous to that for
trace monoamines or amphetamines (e.g., cooper et
al. 1978; karoum et al. 1982; mallinger et al. 1990; dingemanse et al. 1992), available evidence concerning
plasma level-response relationships is scant. plasma
level monitoring of the irreversible mao is does not appear to be of clinical value, perhaps because of the short
half-lives of these medications in relation to their pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., mallinger et al. 1990). available evidence suggests that plasma levels are also not
useful for the prediction of response to either the irreversible (mallinger et al. 1990) or reversible (fritze et
al. 1990; danish university antidepressant group 1993)
maois.
all four fda-approved maois have some structural resemblance to amphetamine. however, they are
neither habit forming or euphoriogenic for the vast
majority of patients (mallinger and smith 1991; thase
in press). nevertheless, metabolic pathways for two of
the nonhydrazine maois (sel and trp) may yield
small amounts of amphetamine (youdim et al. 1979;
karoum et al. 1982). the structure of trp, which may
be viewed as a cyclized form of amphetamine, probably precludes its metabolism to amphetamine except
under unusual circumstances, such as following a massive overdose (youdim et al. 1979). moclobemide and
brofaromine are also nonhydrazine maois. phenelzine
sulfate and  xxxd2389xxx  differ from the other maois
in that they are hydrazine compounds; both drugs have
a nitrogen-to-nitrogen bond in their side chain (klein
and davis 1969; murphy et al. 1984). considerable clinical evidence indicates that the hydrazine maois have
greater hepatotoxicity than the nonhydrazines (klein
and davis 1969; timbrell 1979). the hepatotoxicity of
the hydrazine maois is best illustrated by earlier clini-

maois in depression 187

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

cal experience with iproniazid, which was removed
from the market despite considerable antidepressant
efficacy (timbrell, 1979).
with respect to pharmacokinetics, all four fdaapproved mao is are rapidly absorbed and have elimination half-lives on the order of 1 to 4 hours (murphy
et al. 1987). all four drugs are tightly protein bound
and are excreted after hepatic metabolism. with the possible exception of sel's conversion to amphetamine
(karoum et al. 1982), none has clinically important metabolites (murphy et al. 1987; robinson and kurtz 1987).
both  xxxd2662xxx  and brofaromine also have short
half-lives (thase in press).  xxxd2662xxx , but not
brofaromine, has at least some active metabolites of clinical significance (haefely et al. 1992; thase in press).
it was initially believed that the antidepressant
effectiveness of maois was the direct result of mao
inhibition. this acute effect decreases degradation of
monoarnines (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin, or dopamine) stored in presynaptic neurons, thereby resulting in an increased amount of these neurotransmitters
available at the synaps~ (e.g., schildkraut 1965; klein
and davis 1969). more recent research indicates that
this heuristic model does not fully explain the mechanism of maois' efficacy (mann et al. 1984; murphy et
al. 1987). for example, the positive (+)stem-isomer of
trp is a poor antidepressant despite inhibiting mao
(escobar et al. 1974). the main pharmacologic difference between the negative ( - ) and + isomers of trp
is that the former has much weaker effects as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in relation to its potency
as an maoi (hendley and snyder 1968). the other
maois may also block the reuptake of selected neurotransmitters (murphy et al. 1987). however, like the
nonmaoi uptake inhibitors, these acute effects often
precede clinical antidepressant effects by weeks (murphy et al. 1987). more consistent with the 2- to 4-week
lag in therapeutic effect, chronic treatment with a diverse number of mao is has been shown to reduce the
number of a2- and l}-adrenergic and serotonin (5-ht2)
post-synaptic binding sites in the brain (e.g., murphy
et al. 1987; de montigny and blier, 1988).
methods
literature review

this review identified all relevant literature, summarized the results in evidence tables, combined results
across each study using metaanalysis, and compared
the efficacy of alternative therapies. each step in the
process is discussed below.
the literature review was conducted by the national
library of medicine using medline and psychological abstracts, targeting the key words: monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tranykypromine,  xxxd2389xxx , and
phenelzine. all references published in english from

1959 through july 1992 were retrieved. over 400 abstracts were identified. articles selected were randomized controlled clinical trials (rcts) against either
pbo or another fda-approved antidepressant that
lasted at least 3 weeks, were peer-reviewed, and that
focused on depressive disorders. two studies (hare et
al. 1962; overall et al. 1966) were excluded because the
comparison drug was amphetamine, which is neither
fda-approved for depression nor so ineffective that it
may be considered as a placebo intervention. another
study, by hutchinson and smedberg (1960), was excluded because it only lasted 2 weeks. five additional
studies were excluded because the principal diagnoses
were not depressive disorders (lascalles 1966; solyon
et al. 1973; tyrer et al. 1973; mountjoy et al. 1977; sheehan et al. 1980). in one study (lascalles 1966), patients
suffered from facial pain; in the remaining four, the primary conditions were agoraphobia and/or panic disorder. two other studies were excluded because trp was
compared to either brofaromine (zapletak et al. 1990)
or moclobemide (gabelic and kuhn 1990), which are
not approved for use in the united states. we made
three exceptions with respect to including the results
of sequentially controlled trials. in one case, trp was
compared to 5-htp after patients had failed to respond
to adequate trials of approved antidepressants (nolen
et al. 1985). in the second case, trp was compared to
 xxxd2746xxx  (an fda-approved antidepressant voluntarily withdrawn by its manufacturer) (nolen et al.
1988). in the third case (giller et al. 1984), the authors
treated placebo nonresponders with open label iso.
we chose to exclude sel, moclobemide, and brofaromine from the metaanalysis because these drugs have
neither been approved by the fda for the treatment
of depression, nor is it likely that they will be in the
forseeable future.
a total of 55 rcts were available for review, including one study (mcgrath et al. 1993) that was in press
at the time of review. all cases involving the same
authorial groups were excluded if there was obvious
overlap of subjects included in the published reports.
we also excluded preliminary reports if they were described in more detail in a subsequent publication. in
one case, three groups (davidson and turnbull, 1983;
zisook 1983; giller et al. 1984) published separate
reports from their sites of a collaborative, multisite trial;
subsequently, the overall findings were also reported
(davidson et al. 1988). we included only the three sites'
reports in the metaanalysis. no controlled studies of
children/ adolescents were found, and only one controlled study of geriatric depression (georgotas et al.
1986) was identified. the latter study was combined
with the remaining 54 adult trials.
evidence tables

each article meeting inclusion criteria was read, ab-

188 m.e. thase et al.

stracted by the first author, and tabulated onto evidence
tables. tables 1, 2, and 3 summarize the studies reporting categorical outcomes for each maoi based on the
number of responders in each cell, as well as the numbers of patients randomized to and completing each
treatment cell and associated attrition rates. in 12
studies, the exact number of subjects lost to attrition
was not specified. for simplicity's sake, we included
these studies in the metaanalysis because there was no
indication of differential attrition.
there are two kinds of comparisons reported:
drug-pbo and drug-drug contrasts. a total of 36 maoi
versus pbo comparisons (17 phz, 12 iso, and 7 trp)
and 44 maoi versus standard medication comparisons
(28phz, 9150, and 7trp) were found. not all studies
were subjected to metaanalysis because the outcome
was not reported categorically (i.e., percent of responders). there were nine comparisons from eight
studies excluded for this reason; these studies are summarized in table 4.
in the current metaanalyses, we used categorical
data for two pragmatic reasons: (1) they are of greatest
interest to practitioners and patients, and (2) these data
were available for a larger proportion of studies than
were outcomes on continuous measures. we used the
percentage of patients with a 50% reduction in hamilton rating scale for depression (hrs-d) (hamilton
1960) or a clinical global impression (cgi) (guy 1976)
response of 1 or 2 (markedly improved or very much
improved) to define responders. these definitions were
chosen because they are the most commonly reported
methods to determine categorical outcome (thase and
kupfer 1987; prien et al. 1991; angst et al. 1993). it
should be noted that this method of determining categorical outcome may include a fair number of partially
remitted cases (i.e., those with a high level of residual
symptomatology). although we accept that this level
of improvement is clinically meaningful for the purposes of metaanalysis (angst et al. 1993), we recognize
that different results might emerge if a more stringent
definition of outcome were to be utilized, such as complete remission (e.g., 17-item hrs-d 7 or~ 9) (frank
et al. 1991). when looking across acute phase studies
with varying lengths (e.g., 4, 6, and 8 weeks), the 50%
reduction rate also may underestimate the full response
rate in the shorter studies.
the response rate (treatment success) can be
reported in three different ways. the question of how
many patients randomized to the treatment got better
is answered by an analysis of "intent-to-treat" (itt) sample. an itt analysis uses all patients who got better
(regardless of whether they remained in the study) as
the numerator, and the number randomized to treatment as the denominator. to answer the question of
how many get better of those who received at least the
minimal amount of treatment thought to be effective,

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

an "adequate treatment" (at) sample is used. only
those who received a predetermined minimum amount
of treatment (typically 3 to 4 weeks for antidepressant
studies) constitutes the denominator, whereas numerator counts those who responded while in treatment.
thirdly, a "completer" sample includes only those who
received full treatment as the numerator (responders)
and denominator (all completing treatment). these distinctions critically affect interpretation of study results,
particularly when there is early attrition as a result of
side effects. accordingly, use of itt samples is recommended for pharmacotherapy studies (lavori 1992).
this report emphasizes use of modified itt samples for metaanalysis. the denominator for the modified
itt was the number randomized to treatment, whereas
the numerator was the number who stayed in treatment
and got better. this modification was necessary because
most studies did not follow-up patients once they exited the study. if some patients who left a study got
better anyway (which is quite possible), the modified
itt response rates would be lower than those derived
from a true intent-to-treat analysis. however, bias
across treatment groups is not expected, so that between-treatment comparisons should still be valid. in
general, at samples often reveal 10 to 20% higher response rates than the itt sample-especially with outpatients.
overall, 981 cases began treatment with phz in
controlled clinical trials reporting categorical outcomes,
of which 799 completed an adequate treatment trials
(i.e., ~3 weeks of therapy) (table 1). table 2 reveals that
a total of 434 patients began treatment in controlled
studies of iso, of which 373 cases received adequate
trials. a total of 293 patients were randomly assigned
to trp in controlled clinical trials with categorical outcomes, of which 244 received adequate treatment trials
(table 3).
metaanalysis
we used the confidence profile method (cpm) of metaanalysis (eddy et al. 1990) to calculate the response rates
in each study and to provide summary statistics. this
method employs a hierarchical bayesian random-effects
model and calculates the probability distribution to describe results expected if a hypothetical additional study
(similar to the ones included in the analysis) were to
be performed. by taking into account the heterogeneity of study results, the cpm depicts the expected range
of results if pharmacotherapists were to use similar
treatment protocols and patient samples in practice.
each metaanalysis produces a probability distribution that depicts the likelihood that the parameter of
interest falls within any particular range of values. for
example, the metaanalysis result depicted in figure 1
indicates that the mean (50th percentile) is .05% ± 6.6%,

studies provide evidence that patients differ in the nature, likelihood, and severity of side effects experienced
with a particular type of antidepressant medication.
heterogeneity with regard to side effects may make
equivalently effective drugs based on trial data differently effective for a particular patient.

limitations of metaanalysis

difference of probability of success

figure 1.

graphic results representation of metaanalysis.

that 95% of the area of the curve (the bayesian equivalent of a 95% confidence interval) lies between -8.0%
and 17.7%, (i.e., there is a 22.5% chance that the actual
value is less than zero). with this probability distribution, the reader can determine the probability that the
true effect of treatment is greater than, less than, or
equal to any selected value. because space considerations preclude graphic presentations, the summary calculations report the number of studies used in the calculation, the mean, and the standard deviation. the
latter variable serves as an indicator of the shape of the
distribution. distributions with smaller standard deviations relative to the mean are tall and narrow, indicating a higher degree of certainty of the result.
undue significance should not be attached to small
differences found by metaanalysis. figure 2 depicts the
results of two metaanalyses, one for treatment a, with
a success rate of 34% (± 12%), and one for treatment
b, with a success rate of 28% (± 11%). although comparison of the means reveals that a is 6% better than
b, there is about a 34% chance that bis actually better
than a. therefore, it is not certain that a was superior.
on the other hand, metaanalysis may show that
several different treatments have similar response rates.
this fmding does not logically lead to the assertion that
the two treatments are equivalent in actual practice unless it can be shown that the same patients respond to
both treatments. the evidence suggesting biological
heterogeneity among patients with major depressive
disorder (e.g., thase et al. 1985; goodwin and jamison 1990; rush et al. 1991) is most compatible with the
notion of differential response to medication. for example, some treatments may be effective earlier in the
course of recurrent mood disorders, whereas others
may be better in more chronic or recurrent cases (e.g.,
post 1992). further, basic pharmacology and clinical

there are several threats to the internal validity of metaanalysis. first, although the random effects model accounts for among-study variations and, in so doing,
controls for random bias, it cannot account for systematic biases occurring across studies. second, to be included in the metaanalysis, studies had to present
sufficient data to permit calculation of the percent response for each treatment based on an itt analysis. if
studies without sufficient data fundamentally differed
from those included, summary statistics may be biased.
similarly, a variety of publication biases (particularly
the tendency to publish only those studies whose results reject the null hypothesis) could result in biased
summary statistics. on the other hand, the hierarchical random effects model is very robust. sensitivity analyses reveal that it would take a huge number of very
large studies to change our results in any important
way, if at least four studies are included in the metaanalysis and if the standard deviation is modest in relation
to the mean difference between treatments.
threats to the external validity of this metaanalysis are primarily related to the generalizability of patient groups studied. although rcts provide the best
evidence for the efficacy of a treatment in a specific type
of patient, stringent enrollment criteria, unique treatment settings, and unrepresentative clinical procedures
may limit applicability to practice in general. methods

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

to address this problem are under development (see
cross design synthesis: a new strategy for medical
effectiveness research, u.s. government accounting
office, b244808 1992); however, the following three
limitations should be kept in mind.
first, whereas most studies entered a well-characterized patient group (e.g., nonpsychotic outpatients
with major depressive disorder), others included unspecified numbers of patients with psychotic subforms
or bipolar disorder. most studies did not specify whether
more chronic or treatment refractory conditions were
included or excluded. without knowledge of the exact
case mix in each study, some caution regarding generalizability is advisable.
secondly, most trials were performed in academic
psychiatric settings and enrolled patients without other
significant psychiatric or serious general medical comorbidity. such patients might be expected to be more treatment responsive than a more heterogeneous, truly representative sample in practice (i.e., patients enrolled
in trials may not be fully representative of populations
of interest).
thirdly, although rcts are conducted by prespecified protocols, these treatment procedures may
differ substantially from routine practice. these differences consequently may affect outcome and generalizability to community practice.

results
phenelzine (phz)

outpatient studies. a total of 23 rcts of phz were
identified, of which 14 were available for metaanalysis
for the modified itt analysis and 16 for the at analysis (table 5). the overall efficacy in outpatients was
57.9% (±4.0%) using the itt sample, whereas it was
70.6% (± 11.1%) with the at sample.
a total of 11 rcts in outpatients compared phz
with pbo (glick 1964; johnstone and marsh 1973;
robinson et al. 1973; ravaris et al. 1976; raft et al. 1981;
rowan et al. 1982; georgotas et al. 1986; liebowitz et
al. 1988; quitkin et al. 1988, 1989, 1990) (table 1). the
study by ravaris et al. (1976) provided two contrasts
(30 mg/day and 60 mg/day of phz) against pbo. for
the metaanalysis, we chose only the 60 mg/day group.
virtually all of these studies concerned patients with
nonpsychotic major depressive disorder, although only
those studies published after 1982 consistently used
prospectively determined, standardized diagnostic
nomenclature, such as research diagnostic criteria
(rdc) (spitzer et al. 1978) or the dsm-iii (apa, 1980).
based on the itt sample, the overall efficacy for
phz was 54.3% (±9.6%) in the 10 phz cells categorically reported in pbo-controlled studies. this response
rate is comparable with those found in similar analyses

a figures are % responders; standard deviations are in parentheses; number of studies used in calculations appears in brackets.

for tcas (depression guideline panel, 1993). based on
itt metaanalysis, the phz-pbo difference was 29.5%
( ± 11.1 %). this was based on nine outpatient comparisons, after excluding the 30 mg/day group of ravaris
et al. (1976). based on the at sample (nine outpatient
comparisons, again excluding the ravaris et al. 30
mg/day group), the phz-pbo difference was 38.5%
(± 13.1%).
two pbo-controlled outpatient trials of phz did
not report categorical response rates (johnstone and
marsh 1973; raft et al. 1981). both studies found
significant improvements in standard depression ratings favoring phz over pbo (see table 4).
twenty contrasts from 18 reports compared response to phz against standard tcas in controlled outpatient trials (see table l; imiah et al. 1964; kay et al.
1973; young et al. 1979; ravaris et al. 1980; raft et
al. 1981; hamilton 1982; rowan et al. 1982; kayser
et al. 1985, 1988; georgotas et al. 1986; davidson et al.
1987; vallejo et al. 1987; liebowitz et al. 1988; quitkin
et al. 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991; mcgrath et al. 1993). the
vast majority of patients in these studies appeared to
have met current criteria for major depressive disorder,
whereas most of the remaining patients would have met
criteria for dysthymic disorder using the current nomenclature. phz doses ranged from 45 to 90 mg/ day.
among these 20 contrasts, one each was with nortriptyline (nor) and trimipramine (tri), 11 were with imipramine (imi), and seven were with amitriptyline
(ami).
comparisons of phz against these standard tcas

was possible on 11 of 20 available contrasts for the itt
sample and on 14 of 20 available contrasts for the at
sample. overall, there was a modest but reliable advantage (8.8 ± 8.3%) favoring phz over comparator
antidepressants in outpatients using the itt sample.
however, many of these studies restricted enrollment
to patients with features of atypical or nonendogenous
depression (kay et al. 1973; ravaris et al. 1980; raft et
al. 1981; rowan et al. 1982; kayser et al. 1985; davidson et al. 1987; liebowitz et al. 1988; quitkin et al. 1988,
1990, 1991; mcgrath et al. 1993). in the eight studies
of atypical or nonendogenous depression suitable for
metaanalysis (kay et al. 1973; ravaris et al. 1980; rowan et al. 1982; liebowitz et al. 1988; quitkin et al. 1988,
1990, 1991; mcgrath et al. 1993), there was a significant
advantage for phz over tcas. the phz-tca difference was 11.8% (±8.4%) based on the itt sample. by
contrast, when the studies of atypical depressions were
excluded from the metaanalysis, the phz-tca difference was -0.7% (± 12.7%) in the remaining three contrasts (imiah et al. 1964; georgotas et al. 1986; quitkin
et al. 1989).
five comparisons between phz and tcas were
available from four outpatient trials reporting only continuous outcome measures (see table 4). in three trials
comparing treatments in atypical or dysthymic samples,
phz was more effective than either imi (davidson et
al. 1987; vallejo et al. 1987) or ami (raft et al. 1981).
in two comparisons of major depressive cases, phz was
less effective than either imi (vallejo et al. 1987) or tri
(young et al. 1979).

202 m.e. thase et al.

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

inpatient studies. there were seven pbo-controlled
inpatient studies available for metaanalysis of overall
efficacy (49.5% ± 14.0%) with the itt sample, and six
inpatient studies for the at sample (54.5% ± 7.3%).
the five available pbo contrasts for inpatients resulted
in aphz-pbo difference of 22.3% (±30.7%). metaanalysis of the four studies with at samples revealed a phzpbo difference of 5.2% (± 13.2%). variability of response is notable in these studies.
a total of eight rcts on inpatients contrasted phz
with another standard tca (see table l; agnew et al.
1961; leitch and seager 1963; martin 1963; greenblatt
et al. 1964; schildkraut et al. 1964; british medical research council, 1965; davidson et al. 1977, 1981). all
of these inpatient trials contrasted phz with imi. for
the itt sample, phz had a 21.0% (±7.7%) lower response rate than imi. for the at group, phz also fared
significantly worse (-15.8%) (± 12.3%) than imi. similarly, electroconvulsive therapy (ect) was clearly superior to phz in the three studies (greenblatt et al. 1964;
british medical research council 1965; hamilton 1982)
providing such a comparison. by contrast, in the single trial reporting only continuous outcome measures,
davidson et al. (1981) found that high dose phz (mean:
81 mg/day) and modest dose imi (mean: 144 mg/day)
were comparably effective.

lsocarboxazid (iso)

eight comparisons from seven pbo-controlled, outpatient rcts with iso were identified (see table 2; ford
et al. 1959; scharer et al. 1966; hays and steinert 1969;
young et al. 1979; davidson and turnbull 1983; zisook
1983; giller et al. 1984; davidson et al. 1988) with five
comparisons suitable for metaanalysis with itt samples. using itt samples, there was an average difference of 41.3% (± 18.0%) between iso and pbo. this
is not statistically significantly higher than the phz-pbo
difference in outpatients. based on the eight at comparisons, the iso-pbo difference was 32. 9% ( ± 21. 7%).
in addition, giller et al. (1984) reported a 69% response
rate in pbo nonresponders "crossed-over'' to active iso
treatment.
five outpatient rcts (see table 2; richmond and
roberts 1964; scharer et al. 1966; hays and steinert
1969; young et al. 1979; larsen et al. 1991) contrasted
iso with tcas (one study used either ami or imi, one
used imi alone, and one each used nor, tri and
clomipramine [clo] as the contrast drug). richmond
and roberts (1964) also concurrently studied trp,
whereas young et al. (1979) also studied phz. iso
dosages ranged from 20 to 60 mg/ day. metaanalysis of
two studies appropriate for itt revealed an iso-tca
difference of only 1.9% ( ± 10.0%). for the four at samples, iso and the contrast tca were equally effective
for outpatients with an iso-tca difference of 4.8%
(± 19.4%).

outpatient studies. based on itt samples, metaanalysis revealed iso efficacy rates of 60.1 % (± 7.1 %) (five
studies), and 68.2% ( ± 11.2%) (eight studies) for the at
samples.

inpatient studies. metaanalysis of four itt samples
showed an overall response for iso of 56.7% (± 10.5%).
for the three at samples, the iso response rate was
50.5% (±18.1%).

six rcts compared iso and pbo in depressed inpatients (tables 2 and4) (agnew et al. 1961; joshi 1961;
overall et al. 1962; rothman et al. 1962; greenblatt et
al. 1964; kurland et al. 1967). all of these studies were
conducted prior to 1970. doses ranged from 20 to 60
mg/day. of the six inpatient contrasts, only one revealed a significant iso-pbo difference (joshi 1961)
based on the authors' report. in a second study involving two inpatient sites (kurland et al. 1967), iso was
more effective than pbo at one site but no more effective than pbo at the other. greenblatt et al. (1964) found
iso to be significantly less effective than pbo. overall
et al. (1962), reporting results on a continuous outcome
measure extracted from several rating scales, found that
iso and pbo were not significantly different.
four inpatient studies were eligible for metaanalysis with itt samples (rothman et al. 1962; kurland et
al. 1967; agnew et al. 1961; joshi 1961). the iso-pbo
difference for inpatients was 15.3% ( ± 12.6%). for the
at sample, the iso-pbo difference was 9.1% (±26.4%)
(three studies). thus, iso has not been shown to be
more effective than pbo for inpatients in doses studied.
a total of four inpatient rcts were found contrasting iso with tcas (agnew et al. 1961; overall et al.
1962; rothman et al. 1962; greenblatt et al. 1964). based
on the authors' report, imi appeared more effective than
iso in doses from 20 to 50 mg/day. of these four
reports, two were available for metaanalysis using the
itt samples (rothman et al. 1962; greenblatt et al.
1964). an overall iso-tca difference of -14.1%
( ± 27.5%) was found favoring the tca over iso. similarly, for two at samples, the iso-tca difference was
-10.0% ( ± 21.8). overall et al. (1962) also found iso
to be less effective than imi on a continuous outcome
composite measure. in the greenblatt et al. (1964)
study, iso also was significantly less effective than ect.
thus, iso, like phz, appears to be a less effective inpatient treatment than both the tcas and ect.

tranylcypromine (trp)

outpatient studies. based on five outpatient studies
subjected to metaanalysis using itt samples, trp had
an overall efficacy rate of 52.6% (± 12.4%). for the six
studies available for at metaanalysis, an overall efficacy
rate of 67.7% (±9.2%) was found.
four pho-controlled outpatient trials with trp
were identified (see table 3; bartholomew 1962; glick
1964; himmelhoch et al. 1982; white et al. 1984). the
glick (1964) report was previously reviewed because
it also included a phz cell. the sample of himmelhoch
et al. (1982) was predominantly bipolar, whereas the
remaining studies enrolled either predominantly or exclusively unipolar depressions. in these four studies,
trp doses ranged from 30 to 60 mg/day. based on the
authors' report, trp' s efficacy exceeded that of pbo in
all four trials.
among the four outpatient, pho-controlled trials,
only the study of glick (1964) was not suitable for metaanalysis. in the remaining three studies, the trp-pbo
difference was 22.1 % ( ± 25.4%). this drug-pbo difference is lower than that of the other mao is in outpatients, but not significantly so. for the three at samples, the trp-pbo difference was 32.1% (±23.4%).
six reports compared trp and various tcas (see
table 3). trp was compared to nor (white et al. 1984)
and either ami or imi (richmond and roberts 1964)
in unipolar depressed outpatients. himmelhoch et al.
(1991) used imi as the comparator in an outpatient study
of anergic bipolar depression, with thase et al. (1992a)
reporting results of a double-blind crossover protocol
for nonresponders from that study. in two other trials,
trp was compared to either imi (spear et al. 1964) or
ami (razani et al. 1983) in samples that included both
in- and outpatients. trp dosages approximated 40
mg/day across all studies.
the authors reported that trp exceeded the efficacy

of the comparison tca in three outpatient studies
(richmond and roberts 1964; himmelhoch et al. 1991;
thase et al. 1992a), including both studies of anergic
bipolar depression. in the remaining three studies, trp
and standard tcas (imi: spear et al. 1964; ami: razani
et al. 1983; nor: white et al. 1984) did not differ in
efficacy.
four of five outpatient rcts contrasting trp and
a standard tca were available for metaanalysis (richmond and roberts 1964; himmelhoch et al. 1991; thase
et al. 1992a; white et al. 1984). the overall trp-tca
difference was 16.8% (± 13.3%), indicating a modest advantage for trp. for the at sample, the trp-tca
difference was 17.3% (± 11.6%). these differences
favoring trp were basically attributable to the pitts-

burgh studies of anergic bipolar depression (himmelhoch et al. 1991; thase et al. 1992a).

table 3; gottfries 1963; razani et al. 1983; nolen et al.
1985, 1988) reported categorical outcomes in comparisons involving trp. in the case of nolen et al. (1985),
trp was significantly more effective than 5-htp. no
tca-controlled study of trp was found in a sample
exclusively comprised of inpatients. the study of razani
et al. (1983), which included a majority of inpatients
(57%), found trp and nor to be equally effective.
in nolen et al.'s (1988) second study, a double-blind
comparison of trp and  xxxd2746xxx  in refractory

 xxxd2746xxx . the importance of this fmding is underscored by the fact that all patients had previously failed
to respond to adequate trials of tcas, fluvoxamine, and
oxaprotiline.
the three inpatient studies available for metaanalysis of itt samples revealed an overall efficacy of 58.6%
(± 10.8%) for trp. the trp-active drug comparison
difference for the itt samples was 18.7% (±23.1%)
based on two studies (razani et al. 1983; nolen et al.
1988). for the at inpatient samples, metaanalysis revealed an overall efficacy of 44.2% (± 16.7%) (three
studies), a trp-pbo studydifferenceof15.4% (± 10.1%)
(one study; gottfries 1963), and a trp-comparator
difference of 8.2% ( ±32.2%) (two studies; razani et al.
1983; nolen et al. 1988). a fourth study was identified
after completion of the metaanalysis, comparing trp
(n = 26), amitriptyline (n = 28), and their combination
(n = 25) in a hospitalized sample (o'brien et al. 1993).
results indicated that the two monotherapies had
roughly equal itt response rates (54 % and 50%, respectively). the combination oftrp and ami was slightly,
but not statistically, superior (64%) to the monotherapies.
in addition to these studies, four published reports
were identified in which trp was compared to either
moclobemide (gabelic and kuhn 1990) or brofaromine
(zapletak et al. 1990; nolen et al. 1993; volz et al. 1994).
two studies were not included in the metaanalysis because of our a priori decision to require either pbo or
an fda-approved comparator (i.e., gabelic and kuhn
1990; zapletak et al. 1990). the remaining two were
published after the completion of the metaanalysis. two
of the trials studied tricyclic resistant depressions (nolen et al. 1993; volz et al. 1994) and one each studied
endogenous (gabelic and kuhn 1990) and nonendogenous (zapletak et al. 1990) depressive subforms.
response to trp ranged from 29% to 79%, with the
poorest showing in nolen et al.'s (1993) study of tricyclic resistant inpatients. it should be noted that only
the nolen et al. (1993) study permitted doses of trp
in excess of 30 mg/ day. in no study was the novel maoi
statistically more effective than trp, although in three
studies the reversible, selective maoi was reported to
be significantly better tolerated (gabelic and kuhn 1990;
nolen et al. 1993; volz et al. 1994).
summary of efficacy data

for outpatients using itt samples, all three maois
appear to be equally effective (phz = 57. 9% ± 4.0%;
iso= 60.1% ± 7.1%; trp = 52.6% ± 12.4%). when
compared to pbo in outpatients, iso (41.3% ± 18.0%)
had a larger relative advantage compared to either phz
(29.5% ± 11.1%)ortrp(22.1% ± 25.4%)inthedoses
studied. however, the large intra-group variabilities in
response rendered these differences nonsignificant.

maois in depression 205

for inpatients, phz was somewhat more effective
(22.3% ± 30.7%) than pbo, whereas the iso-pbo
difference was smaller (15.3% ± 12.6%). thus, the evidence for efficacy in relation to pbo for these two
maois in the treatment of hospitalized patients is not
as robust as for tcas. tranylcyprornine sulfate has simply not been studied in sufficient numbers of controlled
inpatient trials to warrant comment. nevertheless, the
fmdings of nolen and associates (1985, 1988, 1993)
clearly demonstrate efficacy in treatment resistant cases.
moreover, in the recent study by o'brien et al. (1993),
trp was as effective as ami in hospitalized cases.
only one geriatric study (georgotas et al. 1986) met
our criteria for inclusion in the metaanalysis, which
precludes strong inferences about the efficacy of the
maois in older individuals. similarly, only a pair of
related outpatient studies specifically addressed treatment efficacy in bipolar depression (himmelhoch et al.
1991; thase et al. 1992a). although both of these studies
found trp to be superior to imi, the study groups were
delimited bipolar depressions characterized by anergia,
psychomotor retardation, and reversed neurovegetative symptoms. thus, the generalizability of these
findings to the full range of bipolar depressions is
limited. of note, however, is the fact that himmelhoch
et al. (1991) and thase et al. (1992a) found trp to be
equally effective in bipolar i and bipolar ii presentations.
no fully published comparisons were found between approved maois and the newer, nontca antidepressants now available in the united states (e.g.,
trazodone, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine, nefazodone, or bupropion). preliminary findings
from a controlled trial comparing phz and fluoxetine
have been published in abstract form (pande et al. 1992),
with no differences in outcome between the maoi and
the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) observed. one other trial was found comparing the investigational maoi moclobemide with the ssri fluvoxamine (bougerol et al. 1992) in which the mao! and
ssri were comparably effective and generally well
tolerated. moreover, because the newer antidepressants are typically equal to the standard tcas in efficacy
in outpatients (depression guideline panel 1993), it is
reasonable to assume that the maois and these newer
drugs would be shown to be of comparable efficacy in
comparisons of grouped data. nevertheless, it is still
conceivable that these different classes of medications
may treat different subgroups of depressed patients.
for example, nolen et al. (1985, 1988) reported 40% to
60% response to trp in patients previously resistant
to fluvoxamine.
dosing and safety issues

what are the proper dosages for acute phase madi
treatment? although there are few maoi dose-

206 m.e. thase et al.

response studies, the three that were identified found
superior responses to higher doses when compared to
lower dosages (ravaris et al. 1976; davidson et al. 1984;
tyrer et al. 1990). extrapolation from the evidence tables and metaanalyses would indicate that there is no
evidence to support the efficacy of available maois at
daily doses lower than 45 mg for phz, 30 mg for iso,
or 30 mg for trp. indeed, optimal responses appear
to occur in those who can tolerate 75 to 90 mg/day of
phz or 40 to 60 mg/day of iso or trp.
of note is the study by davidson et al. (1984) in
which the value of higher doses of iso was clear only
for nonendogenous depression. this fmding seems
somewhat paradoxical because, traditionally, higher
doses of antidepressant medication are generally utilized in the treatment of more severe depressive states
(e.g., klein and davis 1969). perhaps the higher dosages
of iso specifically enhanced anxiolytic effects in davidson et al.'s (1984) nonendogenous patients.

relationship of acute response to percentage platelet
inhibition and dosage. several groups have investigated whether the degree of platelet mao (type b)
inhibition is related to antidepressant response. the
principal positive findings include a large initial study
of phz (robinson et al. 1978) and three subsequent
replications (davidson et al. 1978b; raft et al. 1981; bresnahan et al. 1990). in each case, higher levels of platelet mao inhibition were associated with higher phz
response rates. greatest efficacy was associated with
values of ~80% to 90% inhibition. however, this association rests on correlations on the order of 0.3 to 0.4,
that is a moderate effect size that accounts for only 9%
to 16% of the outcome variance.
a number of other studies have failed to find a
significant relationship between the percent of platelet
mao inhibition and phz response (dunlop et al. 1965;
beckmann and murphy 1977; georgotas et al. 1981,
1989; lazarus et al. 1986; mcgrath et al. 1993). in addition, in studies of treatment with iso and trp, platelet mao inhibition has not been reliably associated with
degree of improvement (davidson and white 1983;
giller et al. 1984; himmelhoch et al. 1991). however,
most of the negative reports did not study a sufficiently
large number of patients to preclude a type ii error.
this is particularly true because of the relatively modest
strength of the presumed relationship between platelet inhibition and treatment response.
several other lines of evidence suggest that percent
platelet inhibition may be, at best, an epiphenomenon
of maoi response. for example, in studies of sel (a
relatively selective type b maoi), it has been shown
that virtually 100% inhibition of platelet enzymatic activity can be obtained at dosages that do not produce
reliable antidepressant effects (mendis et al. 1981; quitkin et al. 1984; mann et al. 1989). the platelet inhibi-

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

tion paradigm also does not account for drug effects on
type a enzyme in the brain, which may explain the
lack of association in some studies, particularly those
employing trp (e.g., himmelhoch et al. 1991). finally,
in a small series of four cases, mann (1983) described
relapse during maoi therapy despite consistently high
levels of platelet mao inhibition. thus, the routine clinical use of platelet mao inhibition is not recommended
given the current findings.

safety and tolerability. the most common side effects
of acute therapy with the fda-approved maois include orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, mydriasis,
piloerection, edema, tremor, anorgasmia, and insomnia (klein and davis 1969; robinson and kurtz 1987;
rabkin et al. 1988). although the maois have no
prominent acute antihistaminic or anticholinergic effects at the receptor level, many patients experience a
mild degree of dry mouth, blurred vision, and/or constipation. these side effects may be mediated through
secondary, adaptational neurochemical processes, such
as facilitation of noradrenergic neurotransmission
(robinson and kurtz 1987). more recently, excessive
daytime sleepiness has been reported (e.g., joffe 1990).
the latter side effect usually develops after at least
several weeks of treatment. the significance of anorgasmia and other sexual dysfunctions during maoi
treatment also has been documented (mitchell and popkin 1983; harrison et al. 1985). similarly, weight gain
and carbohydrate craving can become particularly
troublesome during continuation and maintenance
therapy (evans et al. 1982; robinson et al. 1991). not
infrequently, daytime sleepiness, sexual dysfunction,
and weight gain are severe enough to lead to termination of an otherwise effective course of maoi therapy
(agosti et al. 1988; robinson et al. 1991).
infrequent to rare side effects include allergies,
hepatic dysfunction (with the hydrazine compounds,
phz and iso), and blood dyscrasias (rabkin et al. 1988).
paresthesias related to  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency has also
been reported during treatment with phz (stewart et
al. 1984). all but the latter effect occur at rates comparable to tcas (klein and davis 1969; robinson and kurtz
1987).
contemporary studies comparing side effects and
attrition resulting from side effects in patients treated
with the fda-approved maois and tcas generally
document equivalent levels of total side-effect burden
and attrition from acute treatment (rabkin et al. 1984,
1985; zisook 1984; harrison et al. 1985; agosti et al.
1988; georgotas et al. 1989; larsen et al. 1991). thus,
although the maois and tcas are distinctly different
types of drugs, their overall tolerability seems equivalent in comparison of grouped data from acute phase
trials. however, the different pharmacologic properties of tcas and maois provide a useful alternative

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

when patients are allergic or develop significant side
effects to one or the other group. extrapolating from
comparisons of the side effects of tcas and the newer
antidepressants (e.g., trivedi and rush, submiti.~d),
the maois would be expected, on average, to be less
well tolerated than these newer agents. the earlier cited
studies comparing trp with rimas certainly are consistent with this notion (gabelic and kuhn 1990; nolen et al. 1993; volz et al. 1994).
two possible subgroups of patients who may be
relatively intolerant to tertiary tcas may be younger
depressed women (raskin 1974; thase et al. 1991) and
anergically depressed bipolar patients of both sexes
(himmelhoch et al. 1982, 1991; thase et al. 1992a). in
such cases, the maois have been reported to be both
better tolerated and more effective (himmelhoch et al.
1991; thase et al. 1992a,b; mcgrath et al. 1993).
the major safety concern during maoi therapy
with the currently approved agents is the so-called
"cheese effect," a sudden episode of hypertension following ingestion of foodstuffs rich in tyramine, or sympathomimetic medications (blackwell et al. 1967; klein
and davis 1969; robinson and kurtz 1987). hypertensive crises during maois therapy occur in approximately five per 100 patients treated per year (rabkin
et al. 1988). the mechanism causing the "cheese effect"
has been known for more than 25 years. at therapeutic
dosages, phz, iso, and trp irreversibly bind to mao
in the gut and liver for days or even weeks. this impairs the oxidative degradation of tyramine and related
vasoactive amines, as well as drugs such as cocaine and
other psychostimulants, decongestants, large doses of
caffeine (and probably other methylxanthine drugs), epinephrine (commonly combined with local anesthetics),
and some antiasthmatic drugs (klein and davis 1969;
robinson and kurtz 1987; harrison et al. 1989). although good data are lacking, in both our experience
and that of others (rabkin et al. 1988), maoi-drug interactions are more common than maoi-diet interactions.
the maoi-related hypertensive crisis is readily reversible with appropriate medical treatment (e.g.,
simpson and white, 1990). nevertheless, it may cause
a cerebrovascular accident or even death in vulnerable
persons (e.g., patients with undetected berry aneurysms or arterio-venous malformations). the risk of
hypertensive crises is, at least in theory, virtually eliminated by instructing patients to adhere to a diet low
in tyramine and other vasoactive amines, and by forbidding the use of all sympathomimetic medications
(e.g., rabkin et al. 1985). unfortunately, many patients
learn that it is possible to "cheat" on such strict dietary
prohibitions. moreover, cases of apparent "autoinduction" or spontaneous hypertensive crises have been
reported during treatment with trp (linet 1986; fallon et al. 1988; keck et al. 1989). it is probably fair to

maois in depression 207

assume that prescription of the older maois coveys
a small but tangible risk of a hypertensive crisis despite
explicit patient education (e.g., 5% risk/patient/year)
(robinson and kurtz 1987). should the newer, selective maois ever be approved for use in the united
states, their virtual freedom from the "cheese effect"
will provide a welcome improvement over the older
agents.
the need to prescribe a low tyramine diet and to
depend upon responsible patient compliance are frequently cited factors inhibiting use of the older mao is
as first- or even second-line agents (clary et al. 1990).
psychiatrists who continue to use maois often specialize in the treatment of mood disorders and, consequently, have greater contact with patients who have
failed with other treatment modalities (paykel and
white 1989; clary et al. 1990). careful patient education, explicit information about dietary restrictions, and
in case of emergencies, ready access to a p.r.n. fastacting antihypertensive (such as sublingual nifedipine)
greatly enhance confidence in the relative safety of these
agents. further, it should be recalled that maois were
used as front-line drugs for over eight years before the
mechanism of the "cheese" reaction was clarified (blackwell et al. 1967).
other potentially problematic drug interactions include incompatibility of concurrent use with meperidine (and, possibly, other narcotics) (meyer and halfin
1981; browne and linter 1987) and ssris (e.g., sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine) (beasley et al. 1993).
both drug classes have been associated with delirious
and/or fatal hyperpyrexic and hypertensive reactions.
there also is some risk of these serious reactions when
maois are used in concert with or close proximity to
tcas (klein and davis 1969). contemporary studies
of combined tca-maoi therapy indicate that the latter risk is modest (young et al. 1979; razani et al. 1983;
o'brien et al. 1993). tricyclic antidepressant-mao!
combinations are still used in refractory depressions
when alternate therapies have failed (e.g., feighner et
al. 1985; fawcett et al. 1991; thase and rush in press).
another combined treatment strategy, the addition of
l-tryptophan to an ineffective maoi, has also been associated with delirium and hyperthermic/hypertensive
reactions (pope et al. 1985), as well as a milder toxic state
characterized by myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and diaphoresis (levy et al. 1985). although the fda's withdrawal
of l-tryptophan from the american marketplace makes
this interaction somewhat moot, both the ssri-maoi
and maoi-l-tryptophan toxicities share a number of
common features suggestive of a serotonin syndrome
(sternbach 1991).
the maois can be problematic in overdose, despite
relatively modest direct effects on cardiac conduction
(robinson and kurtz 1987; simpson and white 1990).
specifically, the coupling of severe, dose-dependent,

208 m.e. thase et al.

hypotensive effects and marked vascular reactivity to
sympathomimetic drugs results in a condition requiring rigorous monitoring in an intensive care setting (linden et al. 1984). as noted earlier, metabolic conversion
of sel or trp to amphetamine following overdose may
complicate matters even further (youdim et al. 1979;
karoum et al. 1982). fortunately, the short elimination
half-lives of all of the maois enable a relatively rapid
clearance of physiological effects, often within 72 to 96
hours of ingestion.
efficacy in depressive subgroups

interest in subgroups of patients especially responsive
to maois dates to initial reports by british investigators
(e.g., west and dally 1959; sargant 1961), who described selected clinical features in patients who responded to maois but who had previously responded
poorly to tcas or ect. these symptoms, referred to
as atypical because of their lower frequency in classic
melancholia, included phobic or panic anxiety and
reversed vegetative features (i.e,. overeating, oversleeping, or weight gain) (west and dally 1959; sargant 1961;
klein and davis 1969). himmelhoch et al. (1972) extended these observations by reporting on trp treatment of tca-resistant patients with anergic bipolar
depression. like atypical unipolar depressions, a number of bipolar patients manifest reversed neurovegetative features (e.g., himmelhoch et al. 1972). other investigations further established the efficacy of maois
in patients with primary anxiety syndromes (e.g.,
solyom et al. 1973; tyrer et al. 1973; mountjoy et al.
1977; sheehan et al. 1980). in close temporal proximity
to these early observations, phz and iso were found
to be essentially ineffective in four large, multi-center,
inpatient clinical trials (overall et al. 1962; greenblatt
et al. 1964; british medical research council 1965;
raskin et al. 1974). thus, the impression was formed
that maois were preferentially effective in milder,
atypical depressions and that maois were less effective than tcas in melancholic or endogenous unipolar depressions.
endogenous depression. the most compelling evidence that maois are less effective in endogenous
depressions comes from the aforementioned inpatient
studies that were all published between 1962 and 1974.
some recent outpatient studies also favor this notion.
for example, vallejo et al. (1987) found a trend favoring imi over phz in a study of 30 dsm-iii melancholic
outpatients. similarly, davidson et al. (1988) reported
that iso was significantly less effective in patients meeting diagnostic criteria for endogenous depression than
it was in patients with nonendogenous depression.
consistent with these data, we found larger and more
predictable maoi-pbo differences in our metaanaly-

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

sis in outpatient studies when compared to inpatient
trials.
in contrast, however, are a number of controlled
and open-label studies suggesting that mao is are effective treatments for many patients meeting contemporary criteria for endogenous depression (davidson
et al. 1981; quitkin et al. 1981; himmelhoch et al. 1982,
1991; mcgrath et al. 1984, 1986; white et al. 1984; nolen et al. 1985, 1988; georgotas et al. 1986; thase et al.
1991, 1992a; o'brien et al. 1993). thus, although tcas
may well be more efficacious frrst-line treatments than
maois in depressions characterized by melancholic or
endogenous features, it is likely that the mao is are also
effective treatments in such cases, particularly when
used in larger doses and/or following an initial failure
to respond to tcas (e.g., nolen et al. 1988; thase et
al. 1991).
the problem may be due in part to the heterogeneity within contemporary criteria for endogenous depression, such that the endogenous depression construct
includes cases that are more (i.e., retarded and anergic
depressions) and less (e.g., agitated unipolar melancholia) responsive to maoi therapy. nevertheless,
there is no question about the efficacy of mao is in comparison to ect. all four studies have found a significant
advantage favoring ect, whether maois were given
as monotherapies (greenblatt et al. 1964; british medical research council 1965; hamilton 1982) or in combination with tcas (davidson et al. 1978a).
psychotic depression. the construct of psychotic
(delusional) depression has evolved significantly over
the past 30 years (schatzberg and rothschild 1992). as
a result, it is not clear what proportion of the inpatient
samples of the early negative studies of overall et al.
(1962), greenblatt et al. (1964), the british medical research council (1965), and raskin et al. (1974) would
meet contemporary criteria for psychotic depression.
subsequent work has clearly shown that psychotic
depressions respond less favorably to antidepressant
monotherapy with tcas (e.g., davidson et al. 1977;
spiker et al. 1985). if a high proportion of such patients
were included in these older trials, it most likely helps
to explain the relatively poor showing of mao is in the
early inpatient studies. none of the contemporary controlled trials of maois have induded psychotically
depressed patients. however, janicak et al. (1988)
evaluated the relative efficacy of phz in psychotic and
nonpsychotic depressions in an open-label, inpatient
study. they found phz to be significantly more effective in non psychotic than psychotic depressions (21/31
versus 3/14), a finding that parallels results from studies
oftcas(e.g., davidsonetal.1977; spikeretal.1985).
thus, maoi monotherapy, like tca monotherapy, is
not recommended for psychotic depressions. publication of a series in which mao is were used in combination with neuroleptics in ect-resistant, psychotic

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

depression would help to establish what role these
agents have in the management of psychotic depression.
atypical symptom features. it has been suggested
that the atypical depression construct can be subdivided
into anxious (type "a") and reversed vegetative (type
"v") forms (davidson et al. 1982; himmelhoch and
thase 1989). yet, it is oversimplistic to consider these
subforms as mutually exclusive, because approximately
one-third of atypically depressed outpatients meet
criteria for both" a" and "v" subtypes (e.g., davidson
et al. 1982; kayser et al. 1988).
with respect to the relative efficacy of phz and
tcas in anxious depression, several studies found
modest, albeit statistically significant differences in favor of maois, particularly on self-reported measures
of psychic or somatic anxiety (e.g., ravaris et al. 1980;
raft et al. 1981; rowan et al. 1982). however, the outcome of patients treated with either phz or the comparator tcas in these studies were generally more similar than different. the columbia university research
group subsequently reported phz to be more effective
than imipramine in atypical depression with panic attacks (liebowitz et al. 1984), an observation partially
replicated by two other groups (davidson et al. 1987;
kayser et al. 1988). however, the columbia group was
not able to replicate this finding in four subsequent
reports (liebowitz et al. 1988; quitkin et al. 1989, 1990,
1993). thus, the predictive value of anxiety or panic attacks for mao! response is unlikely to be more than
modest.
several controlled studies have failed to document
superior response to phz relative to tcas in patients
characterized by isolated reversed vegetative signs,
such as hypersomnia and/or hyperphagia (paykel et al.
1982; white and white 1986; davidson et al. 1988;
kayser et al. 1988). however, these analyses were conducted post hoc in mixed samples of patients. consequently, the results may be inconclusive either because
of inadequate specification of the predictor variables or
insufficient statistical power.
a series of prospective studies by the columbia
group (liebowitz et al. 1984, 1988; mcgrath et al. 1993;
quitkin et al. 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991) addressed these
methodological problems. a "megaanalysis" summary
of these results has also recently been published (quitkin et al. 1993). using an operational definition of atypical depression, consisting of preserved mood reactivity (at least 50% of normal maximum) and at least two
associated symptom features (rejection sensitivity,
leaden anergia, hypersomnia, and/or hyperphagia/
weight gain), phz was superior to imi in four separate
trials (liebowitz et al. 1988; quitkin et al. 1990, 1991;
mcgrath et al. 1993). phenelzine sulfate's superiority
over imi was apparent across the severity spectrum

maois in depression 209

(stewart et al. 1992). two studies further delineated the
specificity of this effect: phz was significantly more
effective than imi in patients with mood reactivity and
only one associated atypical symptom (quitkin et al.
1988), but not in depressions characterized only by
mood reactivity (i.e., no atypical symptoms were present) (quitkin et al. 1989). in the latter study, both phz
and imi were significantly more effective than pbo.
although the columbia university group's concepts of rejection sensitivity and hysteroid dysphoria
(klein and davis 1969) have not yet been widely studied by others, some evidence supports the validity of
this component of atypical depression. in a preliminary
report, kayser et al. (1985) found phz to be more effective than ami in rejection sensitive patients, whereas
the drugs were equally effective in "nonhysteroid" patients. this finding was apparently not sustained, however, in a subsequent report based on a larger sample
(kayser et al. 1988), although the method for reporting
results is somewhat ambiguous. davidson et al. (1988,
1989) found that the related construct of interpersonal
sensitivity (as measured by a subscale derived from the
self-report 90-item hopkins symptom checklist) (derogatis et al. 1973) was associated with more favorable
response to iso relative to pbo.
the relationship between "neurotic" forms of atypical depression, personality pathology, and maoi response has been of interest to clinicians and clinical investigators for years (e.g., west and dally 1959; klein
and davis 1969). the overlap between the columbia
concept of rejection sensitivity, the more prototypic personality style of hysteroid dysphoria (klein and davis,
1969), and the categorical diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is considerable (liebowitz and klein
1981). it is of interest that results from two controlled
trials have yielded strikingly opposite results (parsons
et al. 1989; soloff et al. 1993). in an analysis of the
columbia dataset, atypical depression with associated
borderline personality features was clearly more responsive to phz (20/22) than either imi (13/34) or pbo
(8/38) (parsons et al. 1989). by contrast, in a prospective study of patients meeting dsm-iii criteria for borderline personality disorder, phz was only somewhat
more effective than pbo on a few dependent measures
(soloff et al. 1993), it seems likely that the advantage
for phz reported by parsons et al. (1989) was attributable to the fact that all patients were enrolled in the trial
on the basis of atypical depression (i.e., personality
pathology was secondary to the reason for study entry). by contrast, the study aims of soloff et al. (1993)
were just the opposite. another difference between
these studies was that parsons et al.'s (1989) patients'
entire treatment course was as an outpatient, whereas
most of soloff et al.'s (1993) patient cohort entered the
study as inpatients, perhaps inflating the pbo responses.

210 m.e. thase et al.

a third study of maoi treatment of borderline personality disorder was conducted in a sample of 16
treatment-resistant female outpatients referred to the
national institute of mental health (cowdry and gardner 1988). patients who were not in major depressive
episodes at the time of study entry participated in five
sequential, double-blind, "cross-over" medication trials:
pbo, alprazolam, carbamazepine,  xxxd3431xxx , and
trp (mean = 40 mg/ day). tranylcypromine sulfate was
significantly more effective than pbo, alprazolam and
 xxxd3431xxx  and generally comparable to carbamazepine. this study is thus consistent with the report of
parsons et al. (1989) vis avis the utility of maoi treatment in dysphoric personality disordered patients.
the concept of type v (reversed vegetative) depression has received less extensive study. nevertheless,
four reports from the university of pittsburgh yield consistent findings with respect to differential efficacy of
trp and imi in anergic depression. first, response to
d standardized treatment protocol consisting of 16
weeks of imi and interpersonal psychotherapy was
significantly slower in anergic recurrent depression than
in patients with more "typical" melancholic presentations (thase et al. 1991). second, efficacy of maois in
42 cases of !mi-resistant recurrent depression was
significantly related to the number and severity of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features (thase et al.
1992b). moreover, the degree of symptomatic improvement during tca treatment was significantly inversely
related to subsequent maoi response (thase et al.
1992b). third, trp was significantly more effective than
imi in a controlled trial of anergic bipolar depression
(himmelhoch et al. 1991). finally, trp was efficacious
in a double-blind, cross-over of nonresponders from
the parent study of anergic bipolar depression (thase
et al. 1992a).
one particular subform of type v atypical depression is seasonal (winter) depression. to date, two published studies have reported on response to maois in
winter depression. in an open trial of 14 patients, dilsaver and jaeckle (1990) reported an 86% rate of full
remission (n = 12) over four weeks of treatment with
trp (mean = 32 mg/day). by contrast, lingjaerde et
al. (1993) found no difference between moclobemide
(9/16) and pbo (7/18) in a three week trial of winter
depression. however, significant differences were
found favoring moclobemide on a measure of reversed
vegetative symptoms and among a subgroup of patients
over the age of 45.
in summary, it does appear that maois are
significantly more effective than the tcas in type v
or anergic depressive syndromes. the evidence does
not, however, indicate that the maois are preferentially effective in atypical depression when compared
to their efficacy in other depressive states treated in ambulatory settings. rather, it is likely that the tertiary

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

amine tcas that are significantly less effective (and/or
poorly tolerated) in atypical or anergic depressive syndromes than in more typical depressive states (liebowitz et al. 1988; quitkin et al. 1989, 1993; himmelhoch et al. 1991; thase et al. 1991, 1992a,b; mcgrath
et al. 1993).

chronic depressions. a significant but often unspecified number of outpatients in studies by the research groups lead by quitkin (e.g., quitkin et al. 1993),
robinson (robinson et al. 1973; ravaris et al. 1976, 1980;
kayser et al. al. 1985, 1988), paykel (paykel et al. 1982;
rowan et al. 1982), and davidson (davidson et al. 1981,
1987; raft et al. 1981; davidson and turnbull 1983;
davidson and raft 1984) would meet dsm-iii-r criteria
for dysthymic disorder, chronic major depression, or
acute major depression superimposed on dysthymic
disorder (i.e., "double" depression). thus, results of
these studies are suggestive that maois are more effective than pbo in chronic depressions.
three reports address the question of efficacy in
chronic depressions more specifically. stewart et al.
(1989) reported on a pooled sample of 194 predominantly atypical depressions (defined by columbia
university criteria) and found that phz and imi were
equally effective in "pure" dysthymia (i.e., dysthymia
without major depression), whereas phz was significantly more effective than both imi and pbo in
"double" and chronic depressions. imipramine was
significantly more effective than pbo in "pure" dysthymia, whereas a trend (p = .09) favored phz over
pbo. the relatively small number of cases of "pure"
dysthymia in this report limited the power to detect
drug-pbo differences. atypicality, rather than chronicity, thus appeared to demarcate preferential phz response in the columbia university group's experience.
davidson et al. (1988) compared iso (n = 68) and
pbo (n = 62) in a pooled analysis of a three-site trial.
response in 35 cases of rdc minor depression was 58%
(11/19)foriso and44% (7/16) forpbo. this difference
was not significant in a post-hoc comparison. by contrast, there was a larger, highly significant iso-pbo
difference in the 95 patients meeting criteria for major
depression [34/49 (69%) versus 13/46 (28%), x,2 = 16.1,
df = 1, p = .0001]. chronicity per se (i.e., independent
of the rdc major versus minor depression dichotomy)
was not specified in this study, although the sample's
average length of index depressive episode (28 months)
would suggest that a majority of patients were chronically depressed.
finally, vallejo et al. (1987) found phz to be more
effective than imi in a prospective trial of 30 dysthymic
outpatients, whereas an opposite trend was observed
in melancholia. atypicality apparently was not assessed
in this study. taken together, these three reports suggest that although the maois are efficacious treatments

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

of chronic depression, it is not clear that maois have
preferential efficacy over tcas in chronic depression
after the proportion of cases with atypical depression
is taken into account.
tricyclic resistant depression. more than 20 reports
and clinical series have addressed the use of maois
in treatment resistant depression (thase and rush in
press). however, only four of these studies met the
criteria specilied to be included in our metaanalysis (nolen et al. 1985, 1988; thase et al. 1992a; mcgrath et al.
1993). in addition, the recent studies by nolan et al.
(1993) and volz et al. (1994) were not included because
trp was compared with the experimental maoi
brofaromine.
review of both controlled and uncontrolled studies reveals that approximately 50% of tca-resistant
patients respond to maois, with response rates on
the order of 70% reported in subsamples of atypical or
anergic subforms of resistant depression (thase et al.
1992a,b; mcgrath et al. 1993). the poorest outcome
observed to date in a study of tca-resistant depression was the 29% (5/17) trp response rate in the inpatient study by nolen et al. (1993). this rate was based
on a 50% reduction in hrs-d scores after 29 days
of treatment. using the apparently more generous
cgi scale to classify outcome, 59% of patients responded. we note that nolen et al.'s (1993) trp response rate (29%) was nearly equal to that reported by
thase et al. (1992b) in their subset of patients with
melancholic, nonanergic, tca-resistant depression
(33%). with an end-of-treatment mean trp dose of 81
mg/day, the adequacy of the dosage regimen used in
this trial cannot be questioned. in fact, because mallinger et al. (1990) found a significant inverse relationship between trp blood levels and clinical response
in a protocol permitting upward dosing titration, it is
conceivable that nolen et al. (1993) used too high a
dosage of trp, inadvertently "overshooting" the optimal dosage.
there are no data from studies of resistant depression directly comparing response to the fdaapproved maois with other popular treatment approaches, such as thyroid or lithium augmentation.
comparison of three studies (thase et al. 1989a,b,
1992b) of somewhat overlapping study groups suggests that maoi treatment (principally trp) is more
effective than thyroid augmentation and comparable
with lithium augmentation. a recently published
prospective study comparing treatment with brofaromine (n = 25) to lithium augmentation in an outpatient
sample resistant to maprotiline reached a similar conclusion (hoencamp et al. 1994), although neither
strategy was particularly effective (brofaromine: 5/25;
lithium: 6/26). as noted earlier, the published comparisons of mao is and ect provide unequivocal support

maois in depression 211

for ect as the most effective option (davidson et al.
1978a; greenblatt et al. 1964; hamilton 1982; british
medical research council 1965), although this conclusion would similarly apply to all other pharmacologic
strategies for refractory depression (thase and rush in
press).

bipolar disorder, depressed phase. the proportion
of depressed patients in the early maoi trials suffering from bipolar depression usually cannot be determined. as noted earlier, only a few contemporary
studies have examined maoi response in samples
delimited to bipolar disorder. himmelhoch et al.
(1972) reported on the utility of trp in an open-label
study of tca-resistant bipolar depressed patients in
which most were receiving concurrent lithium. sixteen of the 212 patients responded to treatment with
trp. over the next 20 years, himmelhoch and associates extended this finding in a series of double-blind
outpatient studies relative to pbo (himmelhoch et al.
1982) and imi (himmelhoch et al. 1991; thase et al.
1992a). although trp has consistently performed well
in these studies, replication by other groups would be
reassuring, given the parochial nature of the pittsburgh group's diagnosis of anergic depression.
the efficacy of other maois in bipolar depression
has not been established, nor has the value of maoi
treatment been evaluated in bipolar depressed patients
characterized by melancholic features. with respect to
the former issue, larsen and rafaelsen (1980) reported
on favorable long-term treatment of tca-resistant bipolar depression with iso. with respect to the latter issue, quitkin et al. (1981) described a series of five bipolar depressed patients with unequivocal endogenous
features who responded to treatment with phz following unsuccessful treatment with tcas. more recently,
angst and stabl (1992) compared the outcome of 175
cases of bipolar depression treated with either moclobemide (n = 97) or active comparators (n = 78). patients
were pooled from a large number of clinical trials using
sometimes differing methodologies. they found a 59%
response rate to moclobemide and a 49% response rate
to the other tcas. although a 10% between-group
difference is not statistically signilicant in a study group
of 175 patients, it is in the general direction of the
findings reported by the pittsburgh group.
summary of clinical correlates of maoi response.
current evidence suggests that (1) the maois phz and
iso may have a subtle anxiolytic advantage compared
to tcas; (2) phz is significantly more effective than
imi in atypical depression (as defined by columbia
university criteria); (3) trp is similarly more effective
than imi both in unipolar and bipolar anergic depressions (as defined by university of pittsburgh criteria);
(4) maois are probably less effective than tertiary tcas
as initial treatments of severe, hospitalized, and/or en-

212 m.e. thase et al.

dogenous depressions; (5) maois are particularly useful in tca refractory cases; and (6) when the maois
are directly compared to ect (e.g., greenblatt et al.
1964; british medical research council 1965; davidson
et al. 1978a; hamilton 1982), the latter clearly is superior in efficacy.
continuation/maintenance treatment
six controlled studies were identified concerning
maois during continuation (n = 4) or maintenance
(n = 2) treatment (davidson and raft 1984; harrison
et al. 1986; georgotas et al. 1988, 1989; himmelhoch
et al. 1991; robinson et al. 1991). with respect to continuation treatment, two studies document clear efficacy
when compared to pbo substitution (davidson and
raft 1984; harrison et al. 1986) and one study (georgotas et al. 1988) found equivalence of phz and nor
as continuation treatments for depressed geriatric patients. in the study of himmelhoch et al. (1991), sustained superiority during continuation therapy was
found for trp relative to imi in anergic bipolar depression. although the published literature on continuation phase treatment is meager, available results uniformly indicate that the benefit of maois is sustained
in 80% to 90% of patients for at least the first 3 to 6
months after responding to acute treatment.
two controlled studies (georgotas et al. 1989;
robinson et al. 1991) have examined longer term maintenance treatment with phz. the georgotas et al. (1989)
trial enrolled geriatric outpatients who had responded
to acute treatment with either phz or nor as randomly
assigned. after 4 to 8 months of continuation therapy,
patients were either maintained on study drug or randomly tapered to pbo in a one-year, double-blind maintenance phase. results strongly favored phz; in fact,
the value of nor as a prophylactic treatment relative
to pbo was not clearly established in this study. robinson et al. (1991) studied long-term maoi treatment in
a younger sample of predominantly nonendogenously
depressed outpatients. they found that phz was effective (relative to pbo) in either 45 or 60 mg/day maintenance dosages, with a trend favoring the higher dosage emerging during the second year of the trial.
however, robinson et al. (1991) also reported a very
high number of drug drop outs during long-term treatment, which raises practical concerns about the feasibility of phz maintenance treatment.
it is surprising that so few controlled studies of longterm maoi treatment are available. in this regard, a
recent large, open-label study of prophylactic treatment
with moclobemide indicated excellent tolerance and acceptable prophylaxis, with an approximately 25% cumulative one year relapse/recurrence rate among 153
patients (moll et al. 1992). similarly, in a 1-year open
follow up of 82 brofaromine responders, moller and

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

volz (1992) observed a 30% relapse/recurrence rate.
these rates are comparable to the relapse rates observed
during similar courses of tca of ssri therapy (e.g.,
thase 1992). the problem of loss of therapeutic effect
during long-term maoi treatment is a not infrequent
clinical problem that has eluded explanation (mann
1983; cohen and baldessarini 1985). in some cases, noncompliance and pharmacokinetic factors have been excluded (e.g., mann 1983), suggesting a state of pharmacologic tolerance. although such "breakthrough"
depressive episodes are not unique to the maois (cohen and baldessarini 1985), it is our clinical impression
that they occur more commonly during long-term treatment with the older maois than with tcas. we note,
however, that this impression is not supported by the
data of the only long-term study directly comparing an
maoi (phz) with a tca (georgotas et al. 1989). dosage increase (mann 1983; cohen and baldessarini 1985),
lithium augmentation (nolen et al. 1993), and drug discontinuation (cohen and baldessarini 1985; thase 1992)
are possible strategies to address the loss of drug effect
during long-term treatment.
are the maois interchangeable?
each of the four fda-approved maois share a common organic ring, they inhibit both mao-a and mao-b
at antidepressant doses, and their response rates, sideeffects, and toxicities are much more similar than they
are different. however, in spite of these commonalties,
the interchangeability of the fda-approved maois has
not been established.
only five published rcts have directly contrasted
approved maois. two of these trials are essentially
uninterpretable because of small numbers of patients
(agnew et al. 1961; glick 1964). richmond and roberts
(1964) found comparable response rates to trp (50%)
and iso (60%). greenblatt et al. (1964), on the other
hand, found a strong trend favoring phz (50%) over
iso (28%). young et al. (1979) apparently found no
difference between phz and iso, although outcomes
were not explicitly reported. thus, firm conclusions
about the relative efficacy of the approved maois simply cannot be made.
logically, trp (a nonhydrazine) differs sufficiently
in its side-chain from phz and iso (i.e., hydrazines)
so that patients intolerant to one maoi may do better
on the other. this is particularly true for patients who
develop hepatic dysfunction on hydrazine drugs and
who may be switched to trp following an appropriate
washout (robinson and kurtz 1987). clinical experience
suggest that at least 7 if not 14 days should be allowed
when switching from one maoi to another in order
to minimize the risk of hypertensive or hyperpyrexic
crises (rabkin et al. 1988). in our experience, trp is
more alerting than either phz or iso, so that patients

neuropsychopharmacology 1995-vol. 12, no. 3

who develop marked insomnia or hyperarousal on trp
may tolerate phz or iso better (e.g., himmelhoch and
thase 1989). again, this clinical impression is not, however, supported by any empirical evidence.
maois and the newer antidepressants
with the introduction of the type a selective reversible maois, moclobemide and brofaromine, clinicians
in europe and canada are able to consider choosing
an maoi as a first-line treatment with much less concern about side effects and dietary interactions. perhaps
to help distinguish the newer agents from the older
ones, a new acronym has been coined. rimas (reversible inhibitors of  xxxg1357xxx ). moclobemide has received more extensive study than brofaromine (e.g., moller et al. 1991; angst and stahl, 1992).
a metaanalysis conducted by angst and stahl (1992)
of the efficacy of moclobemide in over 700 patients
found it to be significantly more effective than pbo and
generally equivalent to tcas. in this metaanalysis,
moclobemide was more effective in retarded and endogenous depressions when compared to nonendogenous states (angst and stahl, 1992). however, larsen et al. (1991) found both clomipramine and iso to
be significantly more effective than moclobemide in a
study of nonendogenous patients. the findings of another recent multicenter trial similarly indicate that clomipramine is significantly more effective than moclobemide (danish university antidepressant group 1993).
curiously, in contrast to studies of the older maois,
little evidence has emerged to suggest that moclobemide is a more effective treatment for atypical depression than are the tcas (larsen et al. 1991).
as reviewed earlier, five rcts have compared type
a selective compounds with the older maois. all five
trials reported generally equal efficacy, but an advantage in tolerability during rima treatment (gabelic and
kuhn 1990; zapletak et al. 1990; larsen et al. 1991; nolen et al. 1993). these findings suggest both similarities and differences between the clinical profile and
responsivity to the rimas and the older maois.
should the rima compounds ever be approved for use
in the united states, it is likely that their relative safety
will eventually lead to their ascendancy over phz, iso,
and trp. nevertheless, the lingering clinical impression of some european investigators that the rimas
are less potent antidepressants (e.g., larsen et al. 1991;
danish university antidepressant group, 1993) suggests that the older maois will remain in use for the
treatment of refractory cases for the foreseeable future.
conclusions
it is clear that phz, iso, and trp are effective treatments for outpatients with acute or chronic major

maols in depression 213

depressive disorder. among unselected groups of outpatients, all three fda-approved maois have response
rates approximately equal to those for the tcas. the
major exception to their efficacy revealed in our metaanalysis are that iso is no more effective than pbo
for inpatients. in general, the mao is appear somewhat
less effective than tcas in more severely depressed,
melancholic patients, although this conclusion may be
biased by the results of older studies (e.g., quitkin et
al. 1979). by contrast, the maois may have a modest
advantage over tcas in alleviating symptoms of generalized and phobic anxiety in depressed outpatients. the
risk/benefit ratio of the currently available maois is
such that, despite their efficacy, they are likely to remain as second- or third-line treatments for most
depressed patients.
the major indication for earlier use of the maois
in any contemporary treatment algorithm may be for
depressive syndromes with atypical or anergic features
(e.g., himmelhoch et al. 1991; thase et al. 1992b; quitkin et al. 1993). although further replication is needed,
interpersonal rejection sensitivity may similarly help
to differentiate a subgroup of depressions relatively less
responsive to tcas when compared to maois (davidson et al. 1989). however, it is conceivable that as evidence from studies of the ssris venlafaxine or
bupropion in such patients emerges, this recommendation may be rendered obsolete (e.g., reimherr et al.
1984; goodnick and extein 1989; pande et al. 1992). the
remaining important indication for the use of the
maois in the 1990s is for treatment of patients who
have not responded to ssris, tcas, and/or other
newer generation agents (nolen et al. 1988, 1993; thase
et al. 1991, 1992a,b; mcgrath et al. 1993). again, the
maois may be most effective in resistant depressions
characterized by anergic or atypical features (thase et
al. 1992a, b; mcgrath et al. 1993). for both indications,
the sustained efficacy and tolerability of maois as
maintenance phase treatments warrants further study.
