abstract

indirect systemic and direct oral  xxxg741xxx  and direct oral factor iia inhibitors with
improved pharmacologic profiles compared with heparins and  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists are
currently in clinical development. this overview focuses on the indirect antithrombin
dependent pentasaccharide derivatives of idraparinux and on the most advanced oral direct
inhibitors to  xxxg741xxx  (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and iia (dabigatran). specifically, the
results of dose-finding studies for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective
orthopedic surgery, the results of dose-finding studies for treatment of acute venous
thromboembolism including prolonged prophylaxis of recurrent events, and the designs of
ongoing clinical trials are reviewed.

urrently available options for anticoagulation
include treatment with unfractionated heparin (ufh),
 xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh),  xxxd3522xxx 
antagonists (vkas), and, more recently, the synthetic
pentasaccharide fondaparinux. although these drugs
have proved effective in treating and reducing the risk
of thromboembolic disease, they are associated with
significant drawbacks that limit their use and acceptability in the clinical setting. ufh, lmwh, and
fondaparinux are administered parenterally; thus, they
are inconvenient for long-term use and require dose
adjustment according to the therapeutic range, either
using the activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt)
or chromogenic assays, particularly in renal impairment,
and they may also require the control of platelet counts.
at present, vkas are the only available oral anticoagu-

lants; however, their slow onset and offset of action,
narrow therapeutic window, genetic variations of metabolism, and food and drug interactions necessitate monitoring and dose adjustment to reach the therapeutic
range of the international normalized ratio (inr) of 2 to
3 (table 1).1 as a result, vkas are difficult to manage in
daily practice and in clinical studies. thus, there is a real,
as yet unmet, clinical need for novel oral anticoagulants
with rapid onset of action and devoid of the drawbacks of
conventional anticoagulants.2,3 the pharmacologic and
clinical consequences of their desired characteristics are
outlined in table 2.
the development of new anticoagulants has
therefore focused on synthetic, small-molecular-weight
molecules to avoid the side effects or monitoring
of conventional anticoagulants. the small synthetic

molecules therefore target only one coagulation factor
with high specificity.4 small synthetic molecules directed
toward factor (f) xa and fiia (thrombin) can neutralize
their respective targets whether or not the targets are
clot-bound or  xxxg741xxx -bound, a distinct advantage over the indirect inhibitors that require antithrombin
to mediate their effect.5,6 an overview of the mechanism
of action of the direct  xxxg741xxx  and fiia inhibitors is given in
table 3. the target enzymes of the anticoagulants in this
overview are shown in fig. 1.
the current overview focuses on the indirect
antithrombin dependent pentasaccharide derivatives of
idraparinux and on the oral direct  xxxg741xxx  and thrombin
inhibitors in clinical development. the overview specifically describes the results of dose-finding studies in
postoperative care, the results of dose-finding studies in
the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (vte)
including prolonged prophylaxis of recurrent events, and
describes the designs of ongoing clinical trials.

idraparinux
idraparinux is a hypermethylated derivative of fondaparinux that binds antithrombin with such high affinity that

it assumes a plasma half-life of 80 hours, similar to that
of antithrombin.7 it has linear pharmacokinetics, low
interindividual and intraindividual variability, and may
not require monitoring of anticoagulant intensity.8 consequently, idraparinux can be given subcutaneously on a
once-weekly basis. neither fondaparinux nor idraparinux interact with protamine sulfate, the antidote for
heparin. thus, if uncontrolled bleeding occurs, a procoagulant, such as recombinant factor viia, may be
beneficial.9 because of its long half-life, idraparinux
has not been investigated in postoperative medicine.
idraparinux was evaluated in a phase ii dosefinding trial of 659 patients with proximal deep-vein
thrombosis (dvt). patients were randomly assigned to
warfarin or to one of four doses of once-weekly subcutaneous idraparinux after 5 to 7 days of initial therapy with
enoxaparin. the primary efficacy outcome was the composite of change in thrombotic burden, as assessed by
ultrasonography and perfusion lung scanning at baseline
and week 12  1 and by clinical thromboembolic events.
this outcome was classified as normalization, no relevant
change, or deterioration. other outcomes were major and
other clinically relevant bleeding episodes. the rates of
normalization and deterioration were similar in all groups

patients who were assigned to the idraparinux
group received a once-weekly subcutaneous dose of
2.5 mg. for patients with a creatinine clearance of
less than 30 ml/min, the second and subsequent doses
were 1.5 mg. patients who were assigned to receive
standard therapy received  xxxd3379xxx , enoxaparin, or
intravenous heparin, followed by warfarin or  xxxd59xxx  (inr 2.0 to 3.0). the primary efficacy outcome
was symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism,
defined as objectively documented recurrent pe, dvt,
or death attributed to pe.
for the dvt study, 1452 patients were randomly
assigned to idraparinux and 1452 to the standard therapy. the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism at day 92 was 2.9% in the idraparinux group and
3.0% in the standard therapy group. the treatment was
noninferior to the standard therapy (p < 0.001). between
months 4 and 6, four additional events occurred in each
treatment group. the incidence of clinically relevant
bleeding at day 92 was 4.5% in the idraparinux group
and 7.0% in the standard therapy group (p ¼ 0.004).
after 6 months, the incidence of clinically relevant
bleeding was 8.3% in the idraparinux group and 8.1%
in the standard therapy group (p ¼ 0.85). the rates of
major bleeding were 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, at
3 months (p ¼ 0.35) and 1.9% and 1.5% at 6 months
(p ¼ 0.50). the rate of death at 3 months was 2.3% in the
idraparinux group and 2.0% in the standard therapy
group (p ¼ 0.61). the death rate after 6 months was
4.9% in the idraparinux group compared with 3.9% in
the standard therapy group (p ¼ 0.25).
in the pe study, the incidence of recurrent vte
was 3.4% in the idraparinux group and 1.6% in the
standard therapy group. the noninferiority criterion was
not met (p ¼ 0.59). between months 4 and 6, five additional events occurred in the idraparinux group versus
four events in the standard therapy group. the results
did not meet the noninferiority criterion. the incidence
of clinically relevant bleeding at 3 months was 5.8% in
the idraparinux group and 8.2% in the standard therapy

(p ¼ 0.4) and did not differ from the warfarin group.
additional analyses showed that 7 of 40 (18%) assessable
patients with active cancer had deterioration versus 39 of
574 (7%) patients without active cancer. similarly, 16 of
129 (12%) assessable patients with a history of previous
vte had a deterioration versus 30 of 485 (6%) patients
without such a history. gender, age, creatinine clearance,
body weight, and pharmacokinetic parameters were not
associated with differences in the frequency of deterioration.
there was a clear dose-response for major bleeding among patients treated with idraparinux (p ¼ 0.003).
patients receiving 2.5 mg idraparinux had less bleeding
than did warfarin recipients (p ¼ 0.03). two patients,
both in the 5 mg idraparinux group, had a fatal hemorrhage (intracranial and gastrointestinal) during the study
period. among patients treated with idraparinux, there
was a statistically significant dose-response relationship
for major bleeds (p ¼ 0.003) and for major and other
clinically relevant bleeds (p ¼ 0.001). the incidence of
major hemorrhages in the 10 mg idraparinux group was
significantly higher than that in the warfarin group
(p ¼ 0.010).10
phase iii trials were conducted using 2.5 mg
idraparinux once weekly subcutaneously in patients without renal impairment and at a lower dose in patients with
renal impairment. two randomized, open-label noninferiority trials were conducted in patients with dvt and
pulmonary embolism (pe) to compare the efficacy and
safety of idraparinux versus standard therapy.

group. at 6 months, these rates were 7.7% and 9.7%,
respectively. the rates of major bleeding were 1.1% and
2.1% at month 3 and 1.4% and 2.8% at month 6. the
death rates were 5.1% in the idraparinux group and 2.9%
in the standard therapy group (month 3, p ¼ 0.006). at
6 months, the death rate was 6.4% in the idraparinux
group and 4.4% in the standard therapy group (p ¼ 0.04).
it should be noted that in the pe study, the rate of
recurrence of thromboembolism in the standard therapy
group was lower than anticipated. in most of the contemporary studies, the recurrence rate has been 4 to 5%
in the first 3 months, with recurrent pe accounting for
about two thirds of events. in the pe study, the recurrence rate in the standard therapy group was only 1.6% at
3 months, and recurrences were pe in less than half of
the patients (44%), whereas the observed rates in the
idraparinux group were consistent with those in previous
studies. the excess of deaths from pe reinforces concern
about the decreased efficacy of idraparinux in patients
with pe in this setting.11
the prolonged prophylaxis of vte using idraparinux has been investigated in the van gogh extension
trial. patients with confirmed, symptomatic dvt or pe
who had been treated for 6 months with  xxxd59xxx 
or warfarin (either in previous van gogh studies or
outside these studies) or idraparinux (in van gogh
studies) were randomized to a once-weekly 2.5 mg
idraparinux or placebo. the primary efficacy outcome
was the incidence of symptomatic recurrence of vte,
defined as objectively documented recurrent pe, dvt,
or death attributed to pe.
during the 6 months of randomly assigned treatment, 6 of 594 (1.0%) patients in the idraparinux group
and 23 of 621 (3.7%) patients in the placebo group had
symptomatic, objectively confirmed vte. the reduction in the relative risk with idraparinux was 72.7%
(p ¼ 0.002). major bleeding occurred in 11 of 594
(1.9%) patients in the idraparinux group and in none
of the 621 patients in the placebo group (p < 0.001). a
higher incidence of major bleeding was observed in
patients who had received idraparinux before randomization than in those who had received a vka (3.1% vs.
0.9%; p ¼ 0.06). three bleeding episodes in the idraparinux group were fatal intracranial hemorrhages and
occurred in patients who had received idraparinux before
entry into the trial.
during the observation period after the end of
the additional 6 months of thromboprophylaxis, 7
(1.2%) patients in the idraparinux group and 13
(2.1%) patients in the placebo group had recurrent
vte (p ¼ 0.21). it is noteworthy that events started
to reoccur at 3 months in the placebo group when the
patients had received the last injection of idraparinux
9 months ago. major bleeding after discontinuation of
the study drug occurred in 5 (0.8%) patients in the
idraparinux group and in none of the placebo group

2008

(p ¼ 0.02). the episodes of bleeding, none of which
were fatal, occurred from 1 to 20 weeks after the
discontinuation of a study drug. during the entire
period of observation, a major hemorrhagic episode
occurred in 16 patients in the idraparinux group
and in none of the patients in the placebo group
(p < 0.001).
no major bleeding was observed in the placebo
group, including patients who initially had received
idraparinux, whereas in the idraparinux group, the incidence was 1.9%. of the 11 patients in the idraparinux
group who had a major hemorrhage, eight had previously received idraparinux, and three had received a
vka. after completion of the extended idraparinux
treatment, there were another five episodes of major
bleeding in the idraparinux group. these observations
suggest a prolonged risk of hemorrhage in patients
treated with idraparinux for more than 6 months. the
clinical benefit of such treatment remains to be confirmed because of bleeding complications during prolonged therapy with idraparinux.12
the pharmacodynamics of idraparinux was
analyzed in 23 patients after termination of a 6- or
12-month therapy period for prevention of recurrent
vte at one center in the van gogh trials. of those,
18 patients were treated for 6 months and 5 patients for
12 months.  xxxg741xxx -specific s2222 chromogenic substrate
(axa) assay, heptest, prothrombin-induced clotting
time (pict), activated partial thromboplastin time
(aptt), and prothrombin time (pt) were determined
in 3-month intervals for up to 15 months. pharmacokinetic analysis of the axa assay and heptest derived
elimination half-lives (t1/2) of 60 days and 107 days
(p < 0.0001), respectively. the detailed pharmacodynamic parameters are given in table 4. pict was
prolonged for a period of 9 months. coagulation times
of aptt and pt were not influenced. the t1/2 was
independent from creatinine clearance and the patient’s
body weight. the data support reports of a non-ionic
binding of idraparinux to antithrombin and other
proteins.13
the long half-life of idraparinux may influence
the incidence of recurrent vte after termination of
therapy in the van gogh studies. for patients randomized to idraparinux in the van gogh dvt or pe study
followed by randomization to placebo for 6 months in
the van gogh extension study, vte reoccurred in only
1% of patients within 6 months. the prolonged
circulation of idraparinux (elimination half-life time of
60 days) may have protected these patients from recurrent vte in the van gogh extension trial.13
approximately 4 to 5 half-life times are required
to achieve a steady state of a drug. an elimination halflife of 60 days amounts to 240 to 300 days to reach
steady-state conditions. the higher maximal concentration (cmax) values of patients treated for 12 months

compared with those treated for 6 months indicate that
the steady-state conditions of idraparinux are not yet
reached after 6 months of therapy, if the anticoagulant is
given once weekly subcutaneously. the higher concentration of idraparinux after 12 months of therapy may
explain the higher bleeding rate of patients treated for
12 months compared with 6 months. the antagonism of
the anticoagulant activity of the new biotinylated idraparinux by avidin may offer an option for further
improvement of anticoagulant treatment.14
patients (n ¼ 23) in the van gogh trials were also
followed-up over 24 months at one center for bleeding
events, recurrent vte, and other severe events. during
the main study period within the van gogh trials, two
major bleeding complications occurred in patients
randomized to warfarin (days 70 and 186). during
the follow-up period, two patients initially randomized
to idraparinux suffered from major bleeding events
(days 65 and 140 during follow-up). bleeding was
related to an additional therapy of warfarin or
lmwh, which was indicated in these patients. the
very long half-life of idraparinux was unknown at that
time. thereafter, the long elimination time of idraparinux was taken into consideration. two patients who
needed continuation of anticoagulation after termination of idraparinux warfarin or lmwh were started at
a plasma concentration of 0.1 mg/ml idraparinux or
below. during follow-up, vte occurred in two patients each initially randomized to warfarin (days 58
and 406) and idraparinux (days 266 and 381), respectively. the concentrations of idraparinux were < 0.01
mg/ml in both patients. the data show that the very
long half-life of idraparinux may lead to serious bleeding complications if anticoagulation is given on top of
the circulating compound within 3 or 4 months after
termination of therapy. recurrent vte occurs late

after termination of idraparinux but probably at the
same rate as after termination of warfarin.15

atrial fibrillation
the phase iii amadeus study was a randomized,
open-label trial designed to compare the efficacy and
safety of once-a-week idraparinux versus oral vka
treatment for the long-term prevention of thromboembolic events (stroke and non–central nervous system
systemic embolism [non-cns se]) in patients with
atrial fibrillation (af) and at least one additional risk
factor for stroke. a total of 4576 patients (2283 in the
idraparinux group and 2293 in the vka group) were
randomized. patients with af who were eligible for
vka treatment were randomized to receive either subcutaneous idraparinux 2.5 mg once a week or vka
therapy adjusted to achieve the target inr of 2.5 (range,
2 to 3). the study was powered to show noninferior
efficacy of idraparinux compared with standard vka
treatment in patients with af who require prolonged
oral anticoagulation. the primary efficacy end point was
the composite of all strokes (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and
undefined) and non-cns se. the principal safety end
point was the occurrence of major bleeding or clinically
relevant non–major bleeding. the other safety outcome
was all-cause mortality. the event rate of the composite
end point of any strokes (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and
undefined) and non-cns se was 0.9% with idraparinux
and 1.3% with warfarin (p ¼ 0.007), meeting the criteria
for noninferiority. the incidence of clinically relevant
bleeding, the primary safety outcome, was significantly
higher in the idraparinux group than in the comparator
group (19.7% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.0001), although no overall
difference was observed in all-cause mortality between
the two treatment groups. bleeding appeared over time

and was more pronounced in patients with impaired
renal function and in the elderly (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
these observations indicate the need to consider a dose
reduction of idraparinux depending on these characteristics in patients with af. this will be addressed in the
new borealis-af study.

biotinylated idraparinux
biotinylated idraparinux is structurally similar to idraparinux sodium with the addition of a biotin segment.
it has the same anticoagulant activity as idraparinux in
vivo and the same pharmacologic activity (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; pk/pd). biotin has a
strong and specific affinity for avidin, an egg protein,
which can be given intravenously to rapidly bind,
neutralize, and eliminate idraparinux and its anticoagulant activity.
the clinical development program has been designed in view of clinical results obtained with idraparinux. bioequipotency studies in patients with dvt
(equinox) and in patients with pe (cassiopea)
were initiated comparing idraparinux with biotin-idraparinux. the bioequipotency study of biotinylated idraparinux and idraparinux includes 700 patients with dvt
and contains a substudy on the neutralizing effect of
avidin on the biotin-idraparinux induced anti- xxxg741xxx  activity. the primary outcome measure is the bioequipotency and avidin neutralizing effect assessment. the
study aims to compare during a 6-month treatment the
safety and effectiveness of biotinylated idraparinux with
that of idraparinux, taking into account new events of
dvt and pe and bleeding risk. secondary outcome
measures are pk/pd time courses to steady-state
achievement (anti- xxxg741xxx  activity), bleeding adverse events
and deaths within 6 months, and symptomatic recurrent
dvt/pe (fatal or not) within 6 months (see www.
clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00311090).
patients with symptomatic pe are treated in a
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel
group study with biotinylated idraparinux (3.0 mg subcutaneously once-weekly) versus oral inr-adjusted warfarin (n ¼ 3200). primary outcome measures are
recurrence of fatal and nonfatal venous thromboembolic
events (dvt or pe) at 3 months. secondary outcome
measures are recurrence of vte events at 6 months and
bleedings over 3- and 6-month periods (see www.
clinicaltrials.gov).
in the amadeus trial, bleeding appeared over
time and was more pronounced in patients with impaired renal function and in the elderly. these observations indicate the need to consider a dose reduction of
idraparinux depending on these characteristics in patients with af. this will be considered in the new
borealis-af study, which is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, assessor-blind, noninferiority study

comparing the efficacy and safety of once-a-week subcutaneous biotinylated idraparinux with adjusted-dose
warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolic events in patients with af. treatment will be
administered for a period of 6 months to 2 years. all
patients will start with biotinylated idraparinux 3 mg
(equivalent to base idraparinux 2.5 mg) once a week for
7 weeks, and then the dose will be reduced depending on
age and renal function (see http://en.sanofi-aventis.com/
images/070711_idraparinux_en_tcm24-18621.pdf).

other parenteral  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
ave5026 is a new ultralow-molecular-weight agent
(sanofi-aventis, paris, france) that has been evaluated for the prevention of postoperative vte in patients
undergoing total knee replacement in a phase iib trial
(see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00331838).
sr123781 is a short-acting synthetic hexadecasaccharide, injected once daily, which is a powerful
indirect inhibitor of  xxxg741xxx  and fiia coagulation factors.
in the shine phase iib study, sr123781 was evaluated in patients with non–st-elevated acute coronary
syndrome (see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct
00123565). the study demonstrated good safety with a
bleeding rate similar to ufhs with or without  xxxd53xxx . phase iii trials in acute coronary syndrome
(acs) will soon begin. the drive phase iib study
evaluated the hexadecasaccharide in the prevention of
venous thromboembolic events in patients undergoing
total hip replacement (see www.clinicaltrials.gov;
identifier nct00338897) and demonstrated a correlation between dose and clinical response, and also good
efficacy and safety.
otamixaban is a selective, synthetic direct  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitor. it has a fast onset of action and a short half-life
and thus a suitable profile for use in patients with acs
treated invasively. the sepia-pci phase iia study
demonstrated a good safety profile with predictable and
dose-related anticoagulant activity (see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00133731).
dx-9065a is a direct, small-molecule (571.07
da), selective, reversible  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor that, owing to
its small size, is able to inhibit both free  xxxg741xxx  and  xxxg741xxx 
within the  xxxg741xxx  complex.16 it has a threecompartment distribution, is cleared renally, and at
therapeutic doses has a, b, and c half-lives of 0.23, 2.9,
and 89.9 hours, respectively.17 this results in a functional half-life ranging from 30 minutes to 6 hours
depending on the duration of infusion. xanaduacs was a phase ii, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled
study in patients with non–st-elevation acs. the

to low-dose dx-9065a, and 11.9% of patients assigned
to high-dose dx-9065a (not significant). patients assigned to either low- or high-dose dx-9065a tended to
have less bleeding and required fewer transfusions than
did those assigned to heparin. rates of major or minor
bleeding were similar among patients assigned to heparin (7.7%) and high-dose dx-9065a (7.0%) but was
lower (4.0%) in patients on low-dose dx-9065a.18
the benefit of dx-9065a compared with heparin is
currently being investigated for this indication (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00317395).

oral direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
natural direct inhibitors of  xxxg741xxx  include  xxxd3485xxx  (tap) and antistasin. both are available in
recombinant forms. although these agents have been
shown to reduce arterial thrombosis and restenosis in
animal models, because they are antigenic, neither has
been tested in humans. the oral direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors
that are in clinical development include rivaroxaban
(bayer healthcare), apixaban (bms), ym150 (astellas),
otamixaban (sanofi-aventis), du-176b (daiichi),
ly517717 (lilly), and prt054021 (portola). this
overview focuses on the currently most advanced oral
direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban. it
should, however, be noted that these agents inhibit
 xxxg741xxx  within the assembled  xxxg741xxx  complex as
well as free  xxxg741xxx , whereas fondaparinux is only able to
inhibit the pool of free  xxxg741xxx  in the blood.19

rivaroxaban
rivaroxaban is a synthetic small molecule directed
against the active site of  xxxg741xxx . after oral administration,
it is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine with a
bioavailability of 60 to 80%. peak plasma levels are
achieved within 3 hours, and the drug circulates with a
half-life of 9 hours. rivaroxaban is cleared via two
pathways: 65% is excreted unchanged in the urine,
and the remainder is eliminated through the biliary/fecal
route. because of the predominance of the renal pathway
of excretion, the half-life of rivaroxaban is prolonged in
the elderly and in patients with renal impairment.20
dose finding in postoperative prevention of vte

the proof of principle for the safety of rivaroxaban was
investigated in patients undergoing elective total hip
replacement. a randomized, double-blind, doubledummy, active-comparator controlled, dose-ranging
study assessed the efficacy and safety of once-daily
rivaroxaban relative to enoxaparin for prevention of
vte in these patients. patients (n ¼ 873) were randomized to once-daily oral rivaroxaban doses of 5, 10, 20, 30,
or 40 mg (initiated 6 to 8 hours after surgery) or a oncedaily subcutaneous enoxaparin dose of 40 mg (given the

evening before and > 6 hours after surgery) for 5 to
9 days. the primary end point (composite of any dvt,
objectively confirmed pe, and all-cause mortality) was
observed in 14.9, 10.6, 8.5, 13.5, and 6.4% of patients
receiving 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg rivaroxaban, respectively, and in 25.2% of patients receiving 40 mg
enoxaparin (n ¼ 618, per-protocol population). no significant dose-response relationship was found for
efficacy (p ¼ 0.0852). major postoperative bleeding was
observed in 2.3, 0.7, 4.3, 4.9, and 5.1% of patients
receiving 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg rivaroxaban, respectively, and in 1.9% of patients receiving 40 mg enoxaparin (n ¼ 845, safety population), representing a
significant dose-response relationship (p ¼ 0.0391).
major bleeding rates observed in the 5-mg and 10-mg
rivaroxaban once-daily dose groups were similar to those
with enoxaparin. when both efficacy and safety are
considered, the results of this study suggest that 10 mg
rivaroxaban once daily should be investigated in future
clinical studies. dose-response relationships between
rivaroxaban and the primary efficacy end point (dvt,
nonfatal pe, all-cause mortality) and the primary safety
end point (major postoperative bleeding events) are
shown in fig. 2.21
treatment of acute vte

the aim of this phase ii dose-finding study was to
explore the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban, relative to
standard therapy, for the treatment of acute proximal
dvt. the randomized, parallel-group phase ii trial
in patients with proximal dvt explored the efficacy
and safety of rivaroxaban 10, 20, or 30 mg twice daily or
40 mg once daily compared with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg
twice daily followed by vka for 12 weeks. the primary
efficacy outcome was an improvement in thrombotic
burden at day 21 compression (defined as a  4-point
reduction in the thrombus score as ultrasound measured
by examination). the primary safety outcome was the
incidence of major bleeding up to 2 days after the last
dose. secondary safety measures included the incidence
of minor bleeding events. the primary efficacy end
point was achieved in 53 of 100, 58 of 98, and 62 of 109
patients receiving rivaroxaban 10, 20, or 30 mg twice
daily, respectively, and in 49 of 112 patients receiving
rivaroxaban 40 mg once daily, compared with 50 of 109
patients treated with enoxaparin/vka. there was no
dose-response relationship between rivaroxaban and
the primary efficacy end point (p < 0.67). at 3 months,
the efficacy end point was also not different in patients
randomized to the rivaroxaban doses and enoxaparin/
vka. after 3 months, 2 symptomatic vte events
occurred each in the 10 mg twice-daily (dvt and fatal
pe), 20 mg twice-daily (dvt and pe), and 30 mg
twice-daily (dvt and pe) groups, 3 in the 40 mg daily
group (dvt, pe, and fatal pe), and 1 in the enoxaparin/vka group (dvt).

major bleeding was observed in 1.7, 1.7, and 3.3%
of patients receiving rivaroxaban 10, 20, or 30 mg twice
daily, respectively, in 1.7% of patients receiving 40 mg
rivaroxaban daily, and in none of the enoxaparin/vitamin
k antagonist patients. there were no major bleeding
events.22
beyond 21 days, the pooled point estimates for
 xxxg941xxx  (alt) elevations > 3 times
the upper limit of normal (uln) were 1.9% with
rivaroxaban and 0.9% in the vka group. fatal liver
failure in one patient was attributed to acute hepatitis b
infection; however, a contribution from rivaroxaban or
one of the other concomitant medications cannot be
excluded.
the einstein study is one of two analogous phase
ii trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban
for the treatment of dvt of similar design, but
compared once-daily rivaroxaban (20, 30, or 40 mg)
with a heparin (either ufh or lmwh), followed by a
vka, in 543 patients with symptomatic dvt without
symptomatic pe. the primary efficacy outcome was
deterioration in thrombotic burden or symptomatic
recurrent vte, which occurred in 5.4 to 6.6% of
patients on rivaroxaban and in 9.9% on heparin/vka.
again, there was no evidence of a dose-efficacy relationship with rivaroxaban. during the first 3 weeks of
treatment, the incidence of alt elevations > 3 times
the uln was lower in patients on rivaroxaban, but after
3 weeks, the incidences of elevations were low with
both treatments. no patients in the enoxaparin/vka
group stopped treatment because of elevated liver
enzymes, whereas three patients stopped treatment
early in the rivaroxaban group.23 on the basis of these
trials, the 20 mg once-daily dose of rivaroxaban has
been chosen for evaluation in phase iii randomized
trials.

rivaroxaban (1  20 mg daily) is currently
being investigated for prevention of recurrent vte in
patients with acute symptomatic dvt or pe and
compared with initial anticoagulation with bodyweight–adjusted enoxaparin followed by inr-adjusted
warfarin for 6 months. the primary efficacy outcome is
symptomatic recurrent vte documented objectively.
in addition, death that cannot be attributed to a
documented course and for which vte cannot be
ruled out is included into the end point. the study
duration is 3, 6, or 12 months followed by a 30-day
observational period. approximately 2900 patients suffering from acute dvt and 3300 patients presenting
with acute pe will be included in the study (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00440193).
the prolonged prophylaxis of vte is being investigated in patients with an initial prophylaxis of vte
for 3 to 12 months and no indication for further anticoagulation. these patients are randomized to rivaroxaban (1  20 mg daily) or placebo in a double-blind,
prospective, randomized clinical trial for 6 or 12 months.
end points objectively documented a recurrent vte
including death that cannot be attributed to a documented course or for which vte cannot be ruled out

atrial fibrillation

in patients with non–valvular af, rivaroxaban is compared with inr-adjusted oral warfarin for prevention of
stroke in a double-blind, double-dummy, prospective,
randomized trial. this efficacy and safety trial of 20 mg
once-daily rivaroxaban in preventing thromboembolic
events includes 14,000 patients. patients with a reduced
creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml/min receive
a reduced dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban once daily. the

primary composite outcome event consists of embolic
and nonembolic stroke and non–cns se. the secondary outcome end points are a composition of stroke,
non–cns se, and vascular death (see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct 004403767, rocket trial).
the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for the
prevention of stroke and embolism in 1200 subjects
with non–valvular af are currently being investigated
in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, phase iii
trial in japan. rivaroxaban 1  15 mg daily (subjects
with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 45 ml/min
will receive 10 mg) are randomly compared with inradjusted warfarin for 1 to 2.5 years. the primary outcome composite end point consists of major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding and a composite of
stroke and non–cns se. the secondary outcome end
points are major and minor bleeding events and any
other adverse events as well as the composite outcome
of stroke, non–cns se, and vascular death (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct 00494871).
acute coronary syndrome

in patients with acs, a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-escalating study
is being performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
of rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin alone or with
aspirin and thienopyridine in 1350 patients. the primary
outcome end points are safety of rivaroxaban in patients
with recent coronary syndrome, including st-elevation
mi, non–st-elevation mi, or unstable angina who are
treated with aspirin alone or aspirin plus clopidogrel.
secondary outcome measures are benefit risk assessments and the overall safety of rivaroxaban (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct 00402597, the
atlas acs timi 46 trial).

apixaban
apixaban is a follow-up compound to the oral, direct  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitor razaxaban and is believed to have a superior
risk-to-benefit ratio with respect to bleeding. apixaban is
a highly selective and potent (ki ¼ 0.8 nm) inhibitor of
both free and  xxxg741xxx -bound  xxxg741xxx . in animal
models, the compound was found to have a high oral
bioavailability (51, 88, and 34% in chimpanzees, dogs,
and rats, respectively), multiple pathways of elimination,
including renal and fecal excretion, and minimal potential
for drug-drug interactions and the formation of reactive
metabolites.24 furthermore, it demonstrated potent antithrombotic effects in a rabbit model of venous thrombosis at doses that preserved hemostasis.

six doses of oral, double-blind apixaban (5, 10, or 20 mg
given as a single or twice-daily divided dose) with openlabel enoxaparin or warfarin for 10 to 14 days in 1217
patients. the primary efficacy consisted of dvt confirmed by bilateral venogram, symptomatic dvt, nonfatal pe, and death from any cause. the primary
outcome rate decreased with increasing apixaban dose
(p ¼ 0.09 with daily/twice-daily regimens combined,
p ¼ 0.19 for daily and p ¼ 0.13 for twice-daily dosing).
the primary outcome rates for apixaban 2.5 mg twice
daily and 5 mg daily were 9.0% and 11.3%, respectively,
compared with 15.6% in the enoxaparin and 26.6% in
the warfarin groups. patients on the different apixaban
doses had a relative risk reduction in the primary outcome ranging from 21 to 69% when compared with
enoxaparin and from 53 to 82% when compared with
warfarin. total vte rates were lower in the twice-daily
than in the daily apixaban groups. for the composite
outcome of proximal dvt, pe, and all-cause mortality,
each apixaban group had a lower event rate (0 to 2.7%)
compared with the enoxaparin group (4.6%). the incidence of the primary efficacy end point in the apixaban
groups combined was lower than in the enoxaparin and
warfarin groups (p ¼ 0.02 and p ¼ 0.01, respectively).
the incidence of major bleeding among apixabantreated patients ranged from 0 (2.5 mg twice daily) to
3.3% (20 mg daily); no major bleeding was observed in
either the enoxaparin or warfarin groups. the frequencies
of major bleeding were comparable for twice-daily and
daily apixaban groups. the overall incidences of minor
bleeding during apixaban, enoxaparin, and warfarin treatment were 0.7 to 7.2%, 4.0%, and 5.3%, respectively.
a dose-related response was noted for the incidence of
minor bleeding across the daily apixaban treatment
groups (p ¼ 0.01) but not for twice-daily groups
(p ¼ 0.07). there was a low incidence of major bleeding
with apixaban (0 to 3.3% vs. an unexpectedly low rate of
0 in enoxaparin and warfarin groups). the data of vte
and bleeding are depicted in fig. 3.
deaths were due to fatal pe (2.5 mg twice daily;
after 8 days of study medication); mi (2.5 mg twice daily;
diagnosis after 4 days of study medication, died 3 weeks
later); and end-stage heart failure and cachexia (20 mg
daily; died 6 weeks after 5 days of study medication).
two patients (apixaban 10 mg twice daily and
warfarin) had a single, concurrent elevation in alt > 3
times uln and total bilirubin > 2 times uln on
postoperative day 1, which returned to below these
thresholds by the next evaluation and to within normal
limits by the end of the treatment period (apixaban
subject) or at the 30-day follow-up period (warfarin
subject) with continued drug dosing.25

allocated to one of three double-blind regimens of
apixaban (5 mg twice daily, 10 mg twice daily, or 20
mg daily) or to conventional treatment with lmwh or
fondaparinux followed by open-label vka (dose adjusted to an inr of 2.0 to 3.0). five hundred twenty
patients were included and treated for 84 to 91 days. a
bilateral venous compression ultrasound (cus) of the
legs and a perfusion lung scan (pls) were performed
within 36 hours from randomization and at 12 weeks
(boticelli trial).
the primary efficacy outcome was the composite
of symptomatic recurrent vte and deterioration of
the thrombotic burden as assessed by repeat bilateral
cus and pls. the principal safety outcome was a
composite of major and clinically relevant non–major
bleeding.
for apixaban 5 mg twice daily, 10 mg twice daily,
20 mg daily, and for vka, the primary efficacy outcome
rates were 6.0, 5.6, 2.6% and 4.2%, respectively
(table 5). the principal safety outcome rates were 8.6,

4.5, 7.3% and 7.9%, respectively. the rates of symptomatic vte were 2.6, 3.2, 1.7% and 2.5%, respectively,
and the rates of major bleeding were 0.8, 0, 0.8% and 0,
respectively (table 6). a fixed dose of apixaban seems to
be as safe as enoxaparin/warfarin for treatment of acute
vte.26
in a phase iii randomized clinical trial, the oral
direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor apixaban dosing 10 mg twice daily
for 1 week followed by 5 mg twice daily is being
investigated in patients with acute dvt and pe for
noninferiority to initial body-weight–adjusted enoxaparin followed by inr-adjusted warfarin. primary objectives are the incidences of recurrent vte or vterelated death over 6 months of therapy. the doubleblind design includes a double-dummy study of the inr
values. about 4800 patients are included into the study.
the prolonged prophylaxis after an acute episode
of vte is being investigated using the oral  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor apixaban versus placebo for an extended prophylaxis
of vte in those patients with no indication for a

prolonged prophylaxis of vte using vka. apixaban
2.5 mg twice daily is being compared with 5 mg apixaban
twice daily and placebo twice daily for 12 months.
primary end point is a determination of at least one of
the apixaban dose regimens to be superior to placebo.
the combined end point consists of symptomatic recurrent vte and all-cause mortality in subjects who have
completed a standard of 6 to 12 months of conventional
anticoagulation for prevention of a symptomatic dvt or
pe in 650 patients per group (see www.clinicaltrials.
gov).
atrial fibrillation

a phase iii study has been initiated to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of apixaban, compared with
warfarin, for the prevention of stroke and systemic
embolism in patients with non–valvular af. secondary
outcome measures are confirmed ischemic stroke,
hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause
mortality. this randomized, double-blind, parallelarm study is expected to enroll 15,000 patients (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00412984,
aristotle trial).
another phase iii prospective, randomized,
double-blind clinical trial investigates the prevention
of stroke in patients with af who have failed or are
unsuitable for vka treatment. patients are randomized to 2  2.5 mg daily apixaban versus acetylsalicylic
acid (asa; 81 to 324 mg daily) in a double-blind
design. the study hypothesis is the superiority of
apixaban to asa for preventing the completed outcome of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with
af with at least one additional risk factor for stroke.
a total of 5600 patients are planned to be randomized
into the study with a duration of up to 3 years (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00496769,
averroes).
prevention of vte in hospitalized medical
patients

in a phase iii randomized, double-blind, multicenter
trial, the safety and efficacy of 2  2.5 mg daily apixaban

for 35 to 35 days is compared with 1  40 mg daily
enoxaparin for 10 to 15 days during hospitalization
followed by placebo over 30 days in acutely ill medical
subjects during and after hospitalization for prophylaxis
of vte. approximately 6500 patients will be randomized to apixaban or enoxaparin/placebo. the primary
efficacy outcomes are a composite end point of vte and
vte-related death during the 30-day double-blind
treatment period. total vte is defined as the combination of symptomatic dvt, fetal or nonfetal symptomatic pe, and asymptomatic proximal dvt detected by
cus. vte-related death is defined as sudden death
for which vte cannot be excluded as a cause. this is
a phase iii superiority randomized clinical trial (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00457002,
adopt).
other indications

one study, potentially involving up to 1800 patients,
has begun to assess the efficacy and safety of apixaban
in patients who have recently had unstable angina or
a heart attack (see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier
nct00313300). another study currently under way is
investigating apixaban for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with advanced metastatic
cancer and is expected to enroll 160 patients (see
www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00320255).

ly517717
in preclinical studies, ly517717 was shown to have a ki
of 4.6 to 6.6 nm, an oral bioavailability of 25 to 82%, and
a 1000-fold greater selectivity for  xxxg741xxx  than related serine
proteases. it also demonstrated antithrombotic effects
both in vitro and in vivo in a rat arteriovenous shunt
model, and studies in dogs indicated that the compound
did not have associated bleeding issues. ly517717 was
well tolerated in healthy subjects with a half-life of
25 hours. elimination of ly517717 appeared to be
primarily via the gastrointestinal route.27

determine the efficacy and safety of ly517717, compared with enoxaparin, for the prevention of vte in
patients undergoing total knee replacement or total
hip replacement. patients (n ¼ 511) were randomized
to receive oral ly517717 (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, or
150 mg daily) initiated postoperatively or enoxaparin
40 mg daily initiated the evening before surgery. the
primary efficacy end point of the study was
the incidence of vte, and safety end points were
the incidences of major and minor bleeding up to
30 days after treatment initiation. because of lack of
efficacy, the three lowest ly517717 dose arms were
stopped early, and the study was completed with the
three highest doses only. the 100, 125, and 150 mg
daily doses of ly517717 were not inferior to enoxaparin, with similar incidences of the efficacy end
point (17.1 to 24.0% vs. 22.2% with enoxaparin) and
lower incidences of major bleeding (0 to 0.9% vs. 1.1%
with enoxaparin) and minor bleeding (0 to 1.0% vs.
2.2% with enoxaparin). dose-response relationships
were observed between concentration of ly517717
and prolongation of pt. gender and creatinine clearance affected ly517717 concentration.28

ym150
the compound ym150 has a ki for  xxxg741xxx  of 31 nm and
inhibits prothrombin activation induced by free  xxxg741xxx ,
 xxxg741xxx , and whole-blood clots. ym150 demonstrated potent antithrombotic effects in animal models of venous and arterial thrombosis at doses that did
not prolong bleeding time; this in vivo antithrombotic
activity was also produced by its active metabolite, ym222714. in phase i studies, the drug has been shown to
be well tolerated with predictable pk/pd in healthy
volunteers. food was not found to interfere with the
absorption of ym150.29 pk effects correlated with pd
effects, and a dose-response relationship between
ym150 and pd was observed.
ym150 was investigated in patients (n ¼ 174)
undergoing hip replacement surgery to assess the safety
and efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in a dose-escalation
study. patients were randomized per cohort to oral oncedaily ym150 or subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg daily)
for 7- to 10-day treatment. the ym150 doses were 3,
10, 30, and 60 mg by sequential dose escalation. the
primary end point was major and/or clinically relevant
non–major bleeding. no major bleeds and three clinically relevant non–major bleeds were reported, one in
the 3 mg and two in the 10 mg groups. a dose-related
trend in vte incidence was found (p ¼ 0.006). vte
with enoxaparin was 38.7%.30 a double-blind, dosefinding phase iib study (onyx-2) has now been initiated to confirm the efficacy and safety of ym150 in
patients undergoing thr (see www.clinicaltrials.gov;
identifier nct00353678).

du-176b
in vitro studies have revealed that the ki for human  xxxg741xxx 
is 10,000 times lower than the lowest ki value for any
other human serine proteases (thrombin), indicating that
du-176b is highly specific for  xxxg741xxx . its absorption is
rapid, with a plasma half-life of 8.6 to 10.7 hours, and it is
cleared mainly through the kidneys. the antithrombotic
effect was evaluated in a phase i study. antithrombotic
effects were assessed by comparing ex vivo thrombus.
under venous flow after 1.5 and 5 hours, the thrombus
was 28% and 21% smaller versus baseline, respectively (p
< 0.05). under arterial condition, the reduction was 26%
and 17% (p < 0.05). thrombin generation decreased by
28% at 1.5 hours and 10% at 5 hours. changes in pt and
inr correlated well with plasma drug concentrations
(r ¼ 0.79 and 0.78). pharmacologic analyses showed
that du-176b was scarcely metabolized and suggested
the potential for convenient daily dosing.31
a phase iia open-label dose-finding study of du176b for the prevention of vte after thr was initiated
(see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00107900),
involving 600 patients. results of this trial are not yet
available. phase iib studies with du-176b for the
prevention of vte and the prevention of stroke in
patients with af are in the planning stages. studies in
patients with acute coronary syndromes are planned, too.

prt054021
formerly known as mln-1021, the oral prt054021
has a ki for  xxxg741xxx  of 0.117 nm, bioavailability of 47%, and
a half-life of 19 hours. prt054021 demonstrated antithrombotic activity in animal models and was well
tolerated at a wide range of doses in a phase i doseescalation study involving 64 patients. the half-life
suggests a potential for daily dosing and had predictable
pk and pd effects, as well as minimal interactions with
food. prt054021 was excreted almost unchanged in
bile.
a multicenter, randomized phase ii study has
recently been initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy
of prt054021 40 mg twice daily and 15 mg twice daily
compared with enoxaparin 30 mg for the prevention of
vte in 200 patients undergoing tkr (see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00375609). there are also
plans to develop prt054021 for the prevention and
treatment of dvt, the prevention of stroke in patients
with af, and the secondary prevention of stroke and mi.

 xxxg741xxx  inhibitor 813893
the direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor 813893 (glaxosmithkline,
london, united kingdom) is in phase ii for the prevention of vte after orthopedic surgery and in phase i
for the prevention of stroke in patients with af.
preclinical data showed that this compound had a ki

50

of 7 nm for  xxxg741xxx , a bioavailability of 91% in rats and
> 55% in dogs, and no cytochrome p450 interactions.
phase i studies demonstrated that 813893 was well
tolerated with linear pk.

thrombin inhibitors
thrombin is another target for selective oral thrombin
inhibitors. thrombin not only converts fibrinogen to
fibrin but also activates fxiii. thrombin renders fibrin
resistant to fibrinolysis by inhibiting cross-linking of
fibrin and cross-linking of a2-antiplasmin to fibrin.
other prothrombotic roles of thrombin result in platelet activation, positive feedback on coagulation factors
v, viii, and xi, and antithrombotic roles in the
activation of protein c and thrombin activatable  xxxd207xxx . thrombin is the principal activator of
platelets at sites of injury through its interaction with
platelet protease activated receptors (par)-1 and -4.32
direct thrombin inhibitors inactivate fibrin-bound
thrombin, in addition to fluid-phase thrombin. consequently, they may attenuate thrombus accretion more
effectively. further, direct thrombin inhibitors produce
a more predictable anticoagulant effect than does
heparin because they do not bind to plasma proteins
and are not neutralized by platlet factor 4 and highmolecular-weight multimers of  xxxg2423xxx 
generated at sites of vascular injury.33
three parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors have
been licensed for limited indications. hirudin and  xxxd218xxx  are approved for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, whereas  xxxd348xxx  is licensed
as an alternative to heparin in patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary indications.34

 xxxd3538xxx 
the first orally available direct thrombin inhibitor,
 xxxd3538xxx  is an uncharged lipophilic drug with little
intrinsic activity against thrombin. melagatran is a
dipeptide mimetic of the region of  xxxg784xxx 
that interacts with thrombin’s active site. melagatran
has poor oral bioavailability and must be given subcutaneously.  xxxd3538xxx  is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 20% and
undergoes rapid biotransformation to melagatran via
two intermediate metabolites, h338/57 and h415/
04.35  xxxd3538xxx  has a plasma half-life of 3 to 4 hours
in healthy volunteers and 4 to 5 hours in patients.
because melagatran, the active agent, is eliminated via
the kidneys, however, dose adjustments may be needed
in patients with severe renal insufficiency. as with other
direct thrombin inhibitors, there is no antidote for
 xxxd3538xxx .36
 xxxd3538xxx  has been evaluated and shown to
have efficacy in several settings, including thrombopro-

phylaxis in high-risk orthopedic patients, treatment of
vte, prevention of cardioembolic events in patients
with non–valvular af, and prevention of recurrent
ischemia in patients with recent mi.
additional smaller investigations were done after
termination of the treatment of acute vte, and prophylaxis of recurrent events has been investigated in the
thrive (thrombin inhibitor in venous thromboembolism) treatment trial and the thrive iii trial. the
time course of the alt and in addition of aspartate
aminotransferase (ast) were analyzed. alt increases
dose-dependently during therapy with  xxxd3538xxx .
the less frequent and lower increase of ast values
compared with alt values indicates a nontoxic effect
of  xxxd3538xxx  on liver cells.37
recurrent thromboembolic events were also investigated in patients with vte recruited at the german
study centers, who were followed up for an additional
18 months, treated initially with 2  24 mg  xxxd3538xxx 
daily or placebo over 18 months (thrive iii study).
zero of 9 versus 5 of 14 patients randomized to  xxxd3538xxx  and placebo developed recurrent vte including
1 fatal pe (p ¼ 0.0501). during follow-up, 3 of 9 and 0
of 9 patients initially randomized to  xxxd3538xxx  and
placebo, respectively, developed recurrent vte. thromboembolic events may reoccur in patients with acute
vte after termination of treatment with  xxxd3538xxx .38
a new drug application (nda) was filed in the
united states for  xxxd3538xxx  for the indications of
dvt prophylaxis after total knee replacement, secondary prophylaxis of vte after initial anticoagulant
therapy, and stroke prevention in af. because of
concerns about hepatotoxicity, the food and drug
administration (fda) denied approval of  xxxd3538xxx 
in 2004; the review also raised other issues related to the
design and interpretation of the results of several of the
studies and the potential for an increased risk of coronary
events after the discontinuation of  xxxd3538xxx  after
major orthopedic surgery. in the af trials, the relatively
low frequency of thromboembolic events in the warfarin
comparator group coupled with the need to choose an
appropriate noninferiority margin would mandate the
inclusion of a considerably larger number of patients
with af in trials of other new oral anticoagulants for this
indication.39 although a regimen of  xxxd3538xxx  along
with subcutaneous melagatran in the perioperative period had previously been approved in europe for the
short-term prophylaxis of dvt after major orthopedic
surgery, the drugs were removed from the market in
2006. the  xxxd3538xxx  program nevertheless demonstrated that fixed doses of an oral anticoagulant without
routine coagulation monitoring can be as efficacious in
preventing thrombosis and as safe with respect to major
bleeding as warfarin in adults with satisfactory renal
function. this strategy is now used in clinical trials of
other oral direct thrombin and  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors.40

dabigatran
dabigatran etexilate is an orally available prodrug that is
converted to dabigatran, the active moiety. it is a potent,
competitive, and reversible direct inhibitor of thrombin.
peak dabigatran plasma concentrations occur 0.5 to
2 hours after oral administration, resulting in a rapid
onset of action. there is a biexponential distribution
phase with a terminal half-life of 12 to 17 hours.
as much as 80% of the drug is excreted unchanged by
the kidneys. the average absolute bioavailability of
dabigatran is 6.5%.41
dabigatran etexilate is undergoing evaluation
for the prevention of vte after orthopedic surgery.
in a multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind study,
1973 patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement were randomized to 6 to 10 days of oral dabigatran etexilate (50 or 150 mg twice daily, 300 mg once
daily, 225 mg twice daily), starting 1 to 4 hours after
surgery or to subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg once
daily) starting 12 hours prior to surgery. the primary
efficacy outcome was the incidence of vte (detected
by bilateral venography or symptomatic events) during
treatment. a total of 1464 (75%) patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis. vte occurred in 28.5,
17.4, 16.6, and 13.1% of patients assigned to dabigatran etexilate 50 or 150 mg twice daily, 300 mg once
daily, or 225 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 24%
of patients assigned to enoxaparin. a significant dosedependent decrease in vte occurred with increasing
doses of dabigatran etexilate (p < 0.0001). compared
with enoxaparin, vte incidence was significantly lower
in patients receiving 150 mg twice daily (p ¼ 0.04), 300
mg once daily (p ¼ 0.02), and 225 mg twice daily
(p ¼ 0.0007). compared with enoxaparin, major bleeding
was significantly lower with 50 mg twice daily (0.3% vs.
2.0%, p ¼ 0.047) but elevated with higher doses with the
300 mg once-daily dose (4.7%, p ¼ 0.051).

2008

a logistic regression analysis model of cmax after
administration of the first dose showed a strong correlation with efficacy and safety outcomes (fig. 4). within
the range of clinically relevant (major plus clinically
significant) bleeding events were seen in the study
(ranging from 2 to 5%). a 5% rate of clinically relevant
bleeding corresponded with a predicted cmax of dabigatran of 40 ng/ml. at this plasma concentration, the first
dose of dabigatran etexilate is predicted to be 75 mg with
a dvt rate of 13%.42
treatment and prolonged prophylaxis of
acute vte

the treatment of acute dvt and pe is being investigated in a phase iii randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of the efficacy and safety of oral
dabigatran etexilate (150 mg twice daily) compared
with warfarin (inr 2.0 to 3.0) for 6-month treatment
of acute symptomatic vte, following initial treatment
(5 to 10 days) with a parenteral anticoagulant approved
for this indication (see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00291330, re-cover). primary end
point of the study is the incidence of recurrent symptomatic objectively documented vte during 6 months
of treatment. the study is planned to include
10,500 patients to demonstrate the noninferiority of
treatment with dabigatran etexilate. the trial is performed in a double-blind and double-dummy fashion
including sham inr values of patients treated with
dabigatran.
the prolonged prophylaxis of recurrent vte is
being studied for an additional 18 months in a phase iii
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial
comparing the efficacy and safety of 150 mg dabigatran
etexilate twice daily to inr-adjusted warfarin after
an initial anticoagulant therapy of 3 to 12 months
(see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00329238,

figure 4 logistic regression analysis of cmax on day 1 versus dvt rate (solid curves) and clinically relevant (major plus clinical
significant) bleeding (dashed curves). the median percentage of events and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are
demonstrated. a 5% rate of clinically relevant bleeding (solid horizontal line) corresponds with a predicted dabigatran plasma
concentration of 40 ng/ml and a dvt rate of 13%. (from eriksson bi et al. j thromb haemost 2005;3:103–111, with

remedy). the primary end points are actively
confirmed symptoms of recurrent vte. at least 2000
patients will be required to demonstrate noninferiority of
dabigatran etexilate.
in a second study, the prolonged prophylaxis of
recurrent vte is being studied for an additional
18 months in a phase iii randomized, double-blind
clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of 150
mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily with placebo after an
initial anticoagulant therapy of 6 to 18 months. the
primary end points are actively confirmed symptoms of
recurrent vte. about 2000 patients will be required to
demonstrate the superiority of dabigatran (see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00558259, resonate).
atrial fibrillation

in the petro trial, three doses of dabigatran etexilate
(50, 150, and 300 mg twice daily) were combined with
no asa or 81 mg or 325 mg asa once daily in patients
with af. patients received warfarin alone (inr 2 to 3) in
the comparator group. the trial was double-blind with
respect to dabigatran dose but open-label for concomitant asa treatment and for randomization between
dabigatran and warfarin groups. randomization was
stratified in the ratio 6:9:9:4 (50, 150, and 300 mg
dabigatran, and warfarin, respectively). the primary
outcome was the frequency of bleeding events.
major bleeding events were limited to the group
treated with 300 mg dabigatran twice daily plus asa
(4 of 64). the rate was statistically different compared
with the group treated with dabigatran 300 mg twice
daily without asa (0 of 105, p ¼ 0.02). there was a
significant difference in major plus clinically relevant
bleeding episodes (11 of 64 vs. 6 of 105, p ¼ 0.03) and
total bleeding episodes (25 of 64 vs. 14 of 105,
p ¼ 0.0003) between 300 mg dabigatran twice daily plus
asa and 300 mg dabigatran twice daily without asa.
the frequency of bleeding in the group treated with
50 mg dabigatran twice daily was significantly lower than
that in the warfarin group: 7 of 107 versus 12 of 70
(p ¼ 0.044). when the doses of dabigatran were compared with each other, irrespective of aspirin assignment,
there were differences in total bleeding episodes in the
300 mg twice-daily and 150 mg twice-daily groups versus
the 50 mg twice-daily group (37 of 169 and 30 of 169 vs.
7 of 107, p ¼ 0.0002 and p ¼ 0.01, respectively).
there were two patients with systemic thromboembolic events, both of who received 50 mg dabigatran
twice daily (1.96%). one patient had a peripheral embolism to the toe, and the other patient had a stroke and a
renal infarction. seven patients reported angina, of which
two patients were classified as having acs: 1 treated with
50 mg dabigatran twice daily plus 81 mg asa and the
other treated with 300 mg dabigatran twice daily plus
81 mg asa. both patients were discontinued from the

trial. four patients developed congestive heart failure,
with 1 patient receiving 150 mg dabigatran twice daily
discontinuing the trial. none of these events resulted in
statistically significant differences between treatment
groups.
there was a 0.9% incidence of increased aminotransferase levels > 3 times the uln of normal in
dabigatran-treated patients (4 of 432). adverse events
were more frequent in the dabigatran groups than in the
warfarin-treated patients. because of liver function abnormalities associated with  xxxd3538xxx , the study had
an extensive surveillance of liver function. only 0.9% of
patients had increased levels of alt or ast > 3 times
the uln. no patient had a drug-related increase in
bilirubin > 2 times the uln within 30 days after an
aminotransferase level increase > 3 times the uln.
however, the duration of the study was only 12 weeks.43
the phase ii clinical trial investigating dabigatran etexilate in patients with chronic af is extended for 2 years
to investigate the safety and efficacy of 360 patients
that have previously been treated in the pedro study
(see www.clinicaltrials.gov; identifier nct00157248,
pedro-ex).
in a phase iii trial, a randomized evaluation of
long-term anticoagulant therapy (re-ly) compares the
efficacy and safety of two blinded doses of dabigatran
etexilate with open-label warfarin for the prevention of
stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non–
valvular af. it is a prospective, multicenter, randomized,
open-label, controlled parallel group, noninferiority trial.
the primary end point is to demonstrate that the efficacy
and safety of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate in
patients with non–valvular af are noninferior to warfarin
treatment for the prevention of stroke and systemic
embolism. secondary outcome measures are the incidence of stroke (including hemorrhagic), systemic
embolism, all death incidence of stroke (including
hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, pe, acute mi, or
vascular deaths (including deaths from bleeding). more
than 15,000 patients will be randomized from 1000
clinical sites within 44 countries. patients will be
randomized over a 2-year period with a minimum
1 year of follow-up and a maximum of 3 years and a
mean of 1.5 years of follow-up (see www.clinicaltrials.
gov; identifier nct00262600).
the currently available and ongoing clinical trials
in patients for treatment of acute vte, af, and other
medical indications are summarized in table 7.

conclusion
the future prospects of the new anticoagulants are based
on the continuously improving trial designs. the potential advantages result in the possibility to administer the
new anticoagulants to patients who have limitations for
use of the conventional anticoagulants. the synthetic,

specific small molecules open the possibility to treat
patients without monitoring and dose adjustment and
to increase the safety. dose-ranging studies demonstrated a broader therapeutic range compared with
heparins and vkas without increasing bleeding events.
prolonged treatment, therapy in elderly patients, new
indications in cancer and immunologic disease, and
combination with platelet inhibitors are indications
and improvements of the new anticoagulants.
the question of advantages of oral direct  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitors and oral direct fiia inhibitors may remain
open for a long time. first, differences between each
group of inhibitors with regard to efficacy and safety in
an arterial and venous indication for prevention of
thromboembolism in patients must be determined. in
a second step, a head-to-head comparison of an oral
direct  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor and an oral direct thrombin inhibitor has to be performed if the advantage of one over
the other class of new oral anticoagulants is intended to
be proved. this decision can only be made upon the
availability of published clinical trials in the same
indications. however, it should be taken into consideration that in head-to-head comparisons of similar anticoagulants, the lmwhs, the hypothesis of clinically
relevant differences has had to be rejected thus far in
