in recent years, analogs of  xxxd2364xxx  have been
engineered with the aim of improving therapy for people with diabetes. to ensure that the safety profile of
the human hormone is not compromised by the molecular modifications, the toxico-pharmacological properties of insulin analogs should be carefully monitored. in
this study, we compared the insulin and  xxxg1144xxx  receptor
binding properties and metabolic and mitogenic potencies of insulin aspart (b28asp  xxxd2364xxx ), insulin
lispro (b28lys,b29pro  xxxd2364xxx ), insulin  xxxd2362xxx 
(a21gly,b31arg,b32arg  xxxd2364xxx ), insulin  xxxd2361xxx 
( xxxd2361xxx ) [b29lys(«-tetradecanoyl),desb30 human
insulin], and reference insulin analogs. receptor affinities were measured using purified human receptors,
 xxxg1194xxx  dissociation rates were determined
using chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the
human  xxxg1194xxx , metabolic potencies were evaluated using primary mouse adipocytes, and mitogenic
potencies were determined in human osteosarcoma
cells. metabolic potencies correlated well with insulin
receptor affinities. mitogenic potencies in general correlated better with  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinities than with
 xxxg1194xxx  off-rates. the 2 rapid-acting insulin
analogs aspart and lispro resembled  xxxd2364xxx  on
all parameters, except for a slightly elevated  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor affinity of lispro. in contrast, the 2 long-acting insulin analogs,  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2361xxx , differed
significantly from  xxxd2364xxx . the combination of
the b31b32diarg and a21gly substitutions provided
insulin  xxxd2362xxx  with a 6- to 8-fold increased  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor affinity and mitogenic potency compared with
 xxxd2364xxx . the attachment of a fatty acid chain to
lysb29 provided insulin  xxxd2361xxx  with reduced receptor

affinities and metabolic and mitogenic potencies but
did not change the balance between mitogenic and
metabolic potencies. the safety implications of the
increased growth-stimulating potential of insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  are unclear. the reduced in vitro potency of
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  might explain why this analog is not as
effective on a molar basis as  xxxd2364xxx  in humans.

o

ver the last decade, a large number of insulin
analogs have been designed and examined with
the aim of tailoring the time-action profile of
injected insulin to the need of the diabetic patient
(1,2). insulin analogs also constitute a unique tool to unravel
structure-function relationships in insulin biochemistry and
insulin action. thus, recombinant insulin analogs, together
with naturally occurring insulins, have been important in
mapping the putative receptor binding domain(s) of the
insulin molecule (3–6) and have also been used in studies
aimed at elucidating the specificity of pathways leading to the
metabolic and mitogenic effects of the hormone (7–10).
structure-function studies have indicated that amino acids
essential for binding to the  xxxg1194xxx  include a1gly,
a2ile, a3val, a19tyr, b6leu, b12val, b23gly, b24phe, and
b25phe (3,4,11). the b26–b30 region is not particularly critical for  xxxg1194xxx  recognition and has been a preferred
site for structural modifications aimed at modifying the pharmacokinetic profile of the insulin molecule (1,6). however, the
cooh-terminal part of the insulin b-chain appears to be
implicated in insulin binding to the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor. studies
with a large series of insulin analogs indicated that the  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor affinity of insulin was altered by amino acid substitutions at positions b28– xxxd2274xxx  (10). in particular, the number
and position of basic residues in this region appeared to be
important for  xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding.
furthermore, slieker et al. (10) demonstrated that the relative affinity of the tested insulin analogs for the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor correlated highly with the potency in stimulating growth
of human mammary epithelial cells (hmecs), suggesting
that the growth-promoting activity of the analogs was mediated via the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor. in a similar study of receptor
binding characteristics and metabolic and mitogenic effects
of insulin analogs, hansen et al. (9) found a distinct correlation between mitogenic potential and occupancy time at the
 xxxg1194xxx . thus, analogs dissociating very slowly from
999

in vitro comparison of insulin analogs

the  xxxg1194xxx  (with >3-fold lower dissociation rates than
 xxxd2364xxx ) showed a disproportionate increase in mitogenic activity compared with metabolic activity. an increased duration of the insulin signal at the receptor level
therefore seemed to result in a shift toward mitogenic effects
of insulin, indicated by an increased ratio between mitogenic
and metabolic potencies. this finding suggests that the mitogenic activity of insulin analogs can alternatively be mediated
via a sustained activation of the  xxxg1194xxx . this hypothesis is supported by studies showing that the mitogenic
response to insulin requires a continuous stimulation with the
hormone for a period of >14.5 h (12).
insulin analogs can potentially provide diabetic patients
with a more efficient, reproducible, and convenient therapy.
however, for patients in life-long treatment with insulin, it is
imperative that the benefits of novel insulin analogs are not
associated with increased safety risks. the finding of an
increased tumorigenic potential in female sprague-dawley
rats of the insulin analog insulin b10asp compared with
 xxxd2364xxx  indicated that a single substitution in the amino
acid sequence of the insulin molecule might have significant
toxicological implications (8). the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the tumor-promoting activity of insulin
b10asp are not clear. like  xxxd2364xxx , insulin b10asp is
not genotoxic. however, insulin b10asp is significantly more
potent in stimulating dna synthesis than  xxxd2364xxx  in
vitro (9). it is therefore reasonable to assume that the
increased tumor-promoting activity of insulin b10asp was
coupled with its increased mitogenic potency. the lesson
learned from insulin b10asp is that an assessment of molecular pharmacological properties, including insulin and  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor binding and metabolic and mitogenic potency, is of
significant importance in the toxico-pharmacological evaluation of novel insulin analogs.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between insulin structure,  xxxg1194xxx  and
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding, and metabolic and mitogenic potency
of a series of insulin analogs that have been designed for
clinical use: the rapid-acting analogs insulin lispro
(b28lys,b29pro  xxxd2364xxx ) and insulin aspart (b28asp
 xxxd2364xxx ), which have already been approved for clinical use, and the long-acting analogs insulin  xxxd2362xxx 
(a21gly,b31arg,b32arg  xxxd2364xxx ) and insulin  xxxd2361xxx 
( xxxd2361xxx ) [b29lys(«-tetradecanoyl),desb30  xxxd2364xxx ],
which are currently undergoing clinical investigation. insulin
b10asp was included in the study as a reference compound,
whereas insulin a21gly and insulin b31b32diarg were
included to differentiate the effect of the individual amino acid
modifications of insulin  xxxd2362xxx . the results provide a basis
for discussing the risk-to-benefit ratio of introducing specific
amino acid modifications into the insulin molecule.
research design and methods
materials.  xxxd2364xxx , insulin aspart, insulin lispro, insulin b10asp,
insulin a21gly, and insulin  xxxd2361xxx  were produced by recombinant dna techniques and purified essentially as previously described (13,14). insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  and insulin b31b32diarg were synthesized by enzymatic semisynthesis. briefly, thr-arg-arg-ome was coupled with a21gly,desb30 insulin or
desb30 insulin by the use of the lysine-specific achromobacter lyticus protease in 70% dimethyl formamide. the methyl ester group was removed by
treatment with 0.1 mol/l naoh at 4°c for 15 min, and the insulin analog was
purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
tyra14[125i]-labeled  xxxd2364xxx  and analogs and tyr31[125i]-labeled  xxxg1144xxx 
were prepared as previously described (15,16).  xxxg1144xxx  was obtained from chi1000

ron (emeryville, ca) or from novo nordisk. human  xxxg124xxx  (hsa) was
from behringwerke (marburg, germany), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) from
sigma (steinheim, germany), and culture media from gibco/life technologies
(paisley, scotland, u.k.). radiochemicals were from amersham (little chalfont, u.k.). other chemicals were of reagent grade.
determination of  xxxg1194xxx  binding. human  xxxg1194xxx  (hir)
(isoform without exon 11) was isolated from transfected baby hamster kidney (bhk) cells by solubilization and partial purification on a wheat germ
agglutinin column. for binding experiments, hir was incubated with 3 pmol/l
tyra14[125i]  xxxd2364xxx  and various concentrations of unlabeled human
insulin or insulin analog in a binding buffer containing 0.1 mol/l hepes,
0.1 mol/l nacl, 0.01 mol/l  xxxd2534xxx , 0.5% hsa, 0.2% g-globulin, and 0.025% triton x-100, ph 7.8, for 42 h at 4°c. bound tracer was isolated by precipitation
with 400 µl 25% peg 8000 and washing with 1 ml 15% peg 8000. the data were
fitted to a 4-parameter logistic function where bmax and bmin were fixed and
slope and concentration required for half-maximal effect (ec50) varied. the
relative affinity of an insulin analog was calculated as the ratio between the
ec50 value for  xxxd2364xxx  and that of the insulin analog.
determination of  xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding.  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinities were
determined as described for  xxxg1194xxx  affinities, except that the human
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor (purified from transfected bhk cells) was used and
tyr31[125i]– xxxg1144xxx  was used as the tracer.
determination of receptor binding of insulin  xxxd2361xxx . the conventional
binding assays were not applicable for insulin  xxxd2361xxx  because of the
lipophilicity and tight binding to albumin of this analog. binding experiments
with insulin  xxxd2361xxx  were therefore done using albumin-free buffers and a modified procedure. the binding assays used were microtiter plate antibody capture assays, essentially as described in the literature (17). microtiter plates were
coated with affinity-purified goat anti-mouse igg antibody (pierce, rockford,
il) (50 µl/well of 20 µg/ml solution in tris-buffered saline [tbs]: 0.01 mol/l tris,
ph 7.5, 100 mmol/l nacl). plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature
before washing twice with tbs and blocking with 250 µl superblock (pierce).
then, a suitable dilution of receptor-specific antibody was added: antibody
18–44 against soluble  xxxg1194xxx  (sir) and 24–31 against soluble  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor (sigf-ir) (antibodies from neo markers, union city, ca). for this and
all subsequent dilutions, binding buffer was used (100 mmol/l hepes, ph 8.0,
100 mmol/l nacl, 10 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.02% triton x-100). plates were incubated
for 2 h before washing 3 times with binding buffer. then, a suitable dilution of
sir or sigf-ir was added and plates were again incubated for 2 h before
washing 3 times with binding buffer. binding experiments were performed by
adding a total volume of 150 µl binding buffer to 8–10 pmol/l of tracer
(a14tyr[125i]-insulin or tyr31[125i]– xxxg1144xxx ) and varying concentrations of insulin,
 xxxg1144xxx , or insulin  xxxd2361xxx . after 16 h at 4°c, unbound ligand was removed by
washing once with cold binding buffer, and the tracer bound in each well was
counted in a g-counter. the binding data were fitted using the nonlinear regression algorithm in graphpad prism 2.01 (graphpad software, san diego, ca).
dissociation from the  xxxg1194xxx . dissociation constants for
a14tyr[125i]-insulins were determined as previously described using chinese
hamster ovary (cho) cells overexpressing the human  xxxg1194xxx  (chohir cells) (9). the cells were cultured at 37°c in a 5% co2 humidified atmosphere
in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with 10%
(vol/vol) fetal calf serum (fcs), 1% nonessential amino acids, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 u/ml penicillin, and 1 µmol/l methotrexate. cells were subcultured
at a 1:5 split ratio every 3–4 days for maintenance. for dissociation studies, cells
were seeded on 24-well plates at a density of 5 3 104 cells/well in dmem containing 10% fcs, 1% nonessential amino acids, 20 mmol/l hepes, 0.1% hsa, and
0.1% bacitracin (ph 7.4). cells were used at confluence and were incubated with
50 pmol/l a14tyr[125i]-insulin or analog for 3 h at 4°c. cells were washed quickly
twice with ice-cold hepes-buffered dmem (ph 7.4), and the dissociation of
radioactivity was measured after the addition of hepes-buffered dmem containing 0.1 µmol/l unlabeled  xxxd2364xxx  to measure the maximal accelerated
dissociation rate. cell-associated radioactivity was measured as a function of
time, and the dissociation rate constant (kd) was calculated from the fitted
monoexponential dissociation profiles using the following equation: b = bmin +
(bmax – bmin) 3 exp(–kd 3 t), where b represents cell-associated radioactivity.
metabolic potency. the potency of the insulin analogs for stimulating lipogenesis was determined using isolated primary mouse adipocytes according to
moody et al. (18) with minor modifications. in brief, male mice younger than
4 weeks of age were killed, and the epididymal fat pads were removed and placed
in a degradation buffer containing collagenase at 37°c for 1 h under vigorous
shaking. the cell suspension was filtered, and adipocytes were washed twice
and resuspended in an incubation buffer (krebs buffer, 1% hsa). the cell suspension (0.5 ml) containing ~106 cells was incubated in 5-ml vials with the test
solutions and d-[3h]glucose in an atmosphere of 95% o2 and 5% co2 for 2 h. the
incubation was stopped by adding 3 ml toluene (with 5 g permablend/l) and

counted. some experiments were performed using a 96-well format in which a
100-µl cell suspension was incubated with test compound in an incubation
buffer (krebs buffer, 25 mmol/l hepes, ph 7.8, 1% hsa) and stopped after 2 h
with 150 µl microscint-e (packard, groningen, the netherlands). dose-response
profiles were generated, and ec50 values were determined using a 4-parameter
logistic function (19). the metabolic potency of the insulin analogs relative to
 xxxd2364xxx  was calculated as the ratio between the ec50 values of human
insulin and of the analog, assuming parallelism of the dose-response curves.
mitogenic potency. the human osteosarcoma cell line saos/b10 (20), a subclone of saos-2 (atcc htb-85), was used in this study. b10 cells express
~30,000  xxxg1144xxx  receptors and <1,000 insulin receptors per cell (w. moritz, m.
böni-schnetzler, unpublished data). cells were cultured in dmem/f12 supplemented with 10% fcs, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. during the
entire experiment, cells were grown and kept at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere with 5% co2. for experiments, cells were trypsinized, plated in 24-well
dishes at ~75–100 3 103 cells per well, and cultured for 16 h. growth medium
was then removed and replaced with test buffer (dmem/f12 without fcs
but with 0.5% bsa), and the cells were starved for 4 h. then, the medium was
withdrawn, and cells were incubated with test buffer containing 0.8 pmol/l to
0.8 mmol/l insulin analog for 16 h at 37°c before addition of [3h]methyl-thymidine. [3h]thymidine incorporation was allowed to take place for 4 h at 37°c.
the cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
and lysed in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min under constant gentle rocking at 4°c. the soluble free [3h]thymidine was removed by 3 consecutive
washes in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. the high molecular weight part
of the cell lysates was resolubilized in 1 mol/l koh and neutralized with an
equal volume of 1 mol/l hcl, and dna-incorporated [3h]thymidine was measured in a b-counter. each concentration was assayed in triplicate for each
experiment. the experiments were repeated 3 times. to compare the mitogenic
potential of the insulin analogs with that of  xxxd2364xxx , log-dose response
profiles were generated, and ec50 values were estimated using a 4-parameter
logistic function (19). relative mitogenic potency was calculated as the ratio
between the estimated ec50 values (ec50,hi /ec50,analog), assuming parallelism
of the log-dose response profiles.

results

we have determined the insulin and  xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding
properties and metabolic and mitogenic potencies of a series
of clinically relevant insulin analogs.
 xxxg1194xxx  binding. relative  xxxg1194xxx  binding
affinities were (apart from in the case of insulin  xxxd2361xxx )
determined using solubilized hir, to which  xxxd2364xxx 
bound with an affinity of ~0.01 nmol/l. the results are shown
in table 1.
insulin aspart and insulin lispro were equally potent to
 xxxd2364xxx  in binding to the  xxxg1194xxx , in accordance

with the b26–b30 region being of little importance for insulin
receptor recognition. the  xxxg1194xxx  affinity of insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  was also similar to that of  xxxd2364xxx  and
appeared to be determined by the combined effect of the
a21gly and b31b32diarg substitutions.
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  was less potent than  xxxd2364xxx  in binding to the  xxxg1194xxx . the relative receptor affinity of
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  determined in this study was lower than the
46% found in a previous study (14). this difference is ascribed
to the use of different assay systems in the 2 studies. it is
emphasized that receptor binding assays with insulin  xxxd2361xxx 
are complicated by the lipophilicity and albumin binding of
the analog and that modified assay procedures therefore
have to be applied.
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding. relative  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinities
(apart from in the case of insulin  xxxd2361xxx ) were determined
using solubilized human  xxxg1144xxx  receptor (higf-ir), to which
 xxxd2364xxx  bound with an affinity of ~200 nmol/l. the
results are shown in table 1.
insulin aspart showed an  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity similar to
or slightly lower than that of  xxxd2364xxx . in contrast,
insulin lispro was 1.5-fold and insulin  xxxd2362xxx  6.5-fold more
potent in binding to the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor than  xxxd2364xxx .
similar to binding to hir, the relative  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity
of insulin  xxxd2362xxx  appeared to reflect the combined effect of
the a21gly and b31b32diarg substitutions. thus, the 6.5fold increase in  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity of insulin  xxxd2362xxx  corresponded roughly to the combined effect of a 2.6-fold reduction provided by a21gly and a 20-fold increase provided by
b31b32diarg.
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  was >5-fold less potent than  xxxd2364xxx 
in binding to the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor in the applied assay system.
relative to  xxxd2364xxx , insulin  xxxd2361xxx  was slightly less
potent in binding to higf-ir than in binding to hir.
 xxxg1194xxx  dissociation. time courses for dissociation of insulin analogs from the  xxxg1194xxx  were determined using cho-hir cells, and kd values were calculated
from monoexponential dissociation profiles. examples of dissociation curves are shown in fig. 1.
the kd for  xxxd2364xxx  was 5.2 ± 0.4 3 10–3 min–1. as
shown in table 1, insulin aspart and insulin lispro dissociated

in vitro comparison of insulin analogs

from the  xxxg1194xxx  with a rate similar to that of human
insulin. the a21gly substitution accelerated the dissociation rate ~1.6-fold compared with  xxxd2364xxx , whereas a
b31b32diarg substitution slightly reduced the dissociation
rate. the combined effect of these substitutions provided a
slightly faster dissociation of insulin  xxxd2362xxx  from the insulin
receptor when compared with  xxxd2364xxx .
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  dissociated 2-fold faster from the insulin
receptor than  xxxd2364xxx , suggesting that an increased offrate from the  xxxg1194xxx  contributes in reducing the
hir affinity of this analog.
metabolic potency. the metabolic potencies of the insulin
analogs were compared by generating dose-response profiles
for stimulation of lipogenesis in primary mouse adipocytes.
 xxxd2364xxx  stimulated lipogenesis ~12-fold over the basal
level, with an ec50 value of ~45 pmol/l. the relative metabolic
potencies of the analogs are summarized in table 1.
in general, the metabolic potencies correlated with the hir
binding affinities. however, the b31b32diarg analog had a
slightly lower metabolic potency compared with its hir
affinity.

the measured metabolic potency of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  was
~50-fold lower than that of  xxxd2364xxx . however, insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  binds to hsa with an affinity of ~1 3 105 l/mol (22),
from which it can be calculated that insulin  xxxd2361xxx  is 93.7%
albumin bound in the assay buffer. assuming that only free
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  is biologically active, the metabolic potency
of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  relative to  xxxd2364xxx  corrected for
albumin binding was ~27%.
mitogenic potency. the mitogenic potential of the insulin
analogs was evaluated using human osteosarcoma cells
(saos/b10). examples of parallel dose-response profiles that
were used to determine mitogenic potencies of analogs relative to  xxxd2364xxx  are shown in fig. 2. the saos/b10
cells showed a maximum insulin growth response of >10-fold
over basal and did not differ between analogs. the ec50 value
for stimulation of mitogenesis by  xxxd2364xxx  was typically
4 nmol/l.  xxxg1144xxx  was included as a positive control in all studies and stimulated growth with an ec50 value of ~50 pmol/l.

 xxxd2361xxx  (.). it is noted that in the case of insulin  xxxd2361xxx , the maximum level of dna synthesis was not reached within the tested concentration range because of the low mitogenic potential and high
degree of albumin binding of this analog. however, the data do allow
for calculating the mitogenic potency of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  relative to
 xxxd2364xxx  under the assumption of parallel log-dose response
profiles. each data point is the mean of 3 determinations. all experiments were performed in triplicate. the resulting mitogenic potencies
for all analogs relative to  xxxd2364xxx  are listed in table 1.

both insulin aspart and insulin lispro were slightly less
potent than  xxxd2364xxx  in stimulating growth of saos/b10
cells. the 2 analogs had equal mitogenic potencies, despite the
slightly higher  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity of insulin lispro than of
insulin aspart. this finding is in agreement with previous data
obtained using cho-k1 cells (9) and hmecs (10). in contrast,
insulin  xxxd2362xxx  was ~8-fold more potent than  xxxd2364xxx  in
stimulating dna synthesis in saos/b10 cells. this increase corresponded to the combined effect of the a21gly and
b31b32diarg substitutions that provided a 3-fold lower and
22-fold higher mitogenic potency than  xxxd2364xxx , respectively. it is noted that the result for b31b32diarg was determined
in a previous study using hmecs. saos/b10 cells have similar
numbers of insulin and  xxxg1144xxx  receptors per cell as hmecs (23).
the measured mitogenic potency of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  was
>250-fold lower than that of  xxxd2364xxx . however, insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  binds to bsa with an affinity of ~4 3 105 l/mol (21),
from which it can be calculated that insulin  xxxd2361xxx  is 96.8%
albumin-bound in the assay buffer. assuming that only free
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  is biologically active, the mitogenic potency
of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  relative to  xxxd2364xxx  corrected for
albumin binding was ~11%.
the correction for albumin binding is associated with some
uncertainty. the mitogenic potency of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  has,
however, also been determined in cho-k1 cells at low albumin concentrations (0.02% hsa) (a.s., unpublished data). at
this albumin concentration, insulin  xxxd2361xxx  is estimated to be
77% free (not albumin-bound). in this assay, the mitogenic
potency of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  was determined to be 5.1% (95%
confidence limits 4.0–6.4%, n = 7) compared with human
insulin, and the corresponding calculated mitogenic potency
of free insulin  xxxd2361xxx  was 7%. the agreement between this
result and that found in the present study provides support for
the validity of the applied correction procedure.
discussion

insulin binds and activates its cognate receptor with subnanomolar affinity. insulin also binds the structurally related
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor but with ~1,000-fold lower affinity than the
 xxxg1194xxx  and also with ~1,000-fold lower affinity than
 xxxg1144xxx . at normal physiological insulin concentrations, the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor therefore does not play any role in mediating the
effects of insulin. accordingly, it has been demonstrated that
both metabolic and mitogenic effects of the hormone can be
mediated via the  xxxg1194xxx  (24). however, at supraphysiological insulin concentrations, insulin might also exert
mitogenic effects via the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor, which transmits
growth stimuli more efficiently than the  xxxg1194xxx  (24).
 xxxg1194xxx  binding and metabolic potency. the
analogs examined in this study confirmed that amino acid
modifications in the insulin b-chain beyond position b25 are
not essential for  xxxg1194xxx  binding (3,4). however,
insulin  xxxd2361xxx  had a reduced  xxxg1194xxx  affinity
although modified only in this region of the molecule. it is
likely that the  xxxd2681xxx  attached to the b29lys side
chain makes hydrophobic contacts to one or more of the
aromatic amino acids in positions b24–b25 and thereby
partly shields these residues from recognition by the insulin
receptor. the small reduction of the  xxxg1194xxx  affinity
provided by the a21gly substitution may be due to a minor
structural change caused by the loss of the salt bridge
between a21asn and b22arg (5).
diabetes, vol. 49, june 2000

the relative metabolic potency of the analogs correlated
well with the hir affinities, as expected from previous studies that have shown that binding and activation of the insulin
receptor are the primary events leading to the metabolic
response of the hormone (6,8).
the relationship between in vitro metabolic potency and
biological activity in vivo was not examined in this study.
however, it is interesting to note that insulin  xxxd2361xxx , which
showed a relatively low  xxxg1194xxx  binding affinity and
metabolic potency in this study, has been reported to be less
effective than  xxxd2364xxx  when given in equimolar doses
to healthy volunteers (25,26). it was previously found that
insulin analogs with receptor binding affinities and metabolic potencies ranging from 20 to 300% had equivalent in vivo
biological activity in pigs, probably because elimination of
these analogs was almost exclusively receptor mediated (27).
however, it is possible that the low receptor binding affinity
of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  combined with the markedly changed
pharmacokinetic properties of this analog (14,25,26) could
contribute to reduce the biological activity in vivo, e.g., by
allowing a greater fraction of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  than of human
insulin to undergo nonreceptor-mediated clearance.
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding and mitogenic potency. insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  was 6.5-fold more potent than  xxxd2364xxx  in binding to the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor and slightly more potent than insulin
b10asp. the b31b32diarg substitution has previously been
found to confer increased affinity for the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor. thus,
an analog containing both a b31b32diarg substitution and a
b10asp substitution was almost 90-fold more potent than
 xxxd2364xxx  in binding to the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor (10). the 2 arginine residues at position b31 and  xxxd2274xxx  probably mimic the positively charged arg37arg38 sequence in the c domain of  xxxg1144xxx , which has previously been shown to contribute in mediating
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor selectivity (28). similarly, the loss of a positive
charge in position  xxxd1320xxx  as a consequence of the acylation of the
side-chain amino group of b29lys might contribute to reducing the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity of insulin  xxxd2361xxx . the 3-fold
reduction of  xxxg1144xxx  affinity caused by the a21gly substitution
is difficult to explain considering that native  xxxg1144xxx  contains an
ala residue in the corresponding position.
previous structure-function studies using insulin analogs
have shown that analogs having either an increased affinity
for the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor and/or a reduced rate of dissociation
from the  xxxg1194xxx  possess a relatively higher mitogenic
potency than metabolic potency compared with human
insulin. in this study, the relative mitogenic potencies were
determined using the human osteosarcoma cell line saos/b10,
which shows a marked growth response on insulin stimulation
(10- to 20-fold). the mitogenic potency of the tested insulin
analogs correlated in most cases with the relative  xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding affinities, suggesting that the growth response
of insulin in this cell type is mediated via the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor.
this is particularly clear for the 2 analogs carrying a
b31b32diarg substitution. thus, insulin  xxxd2362xxx  and insulin
b31b32diarg were markedly more potent than  xxxd2364xxx 
in  xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding and stimulation of mitogenesis but
had  xxxg1194xxx  off-rates comparable to that of human
insulin. the low mitogenic potency of insulin lispro, despite
the slightly elevated  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity, indicates that a
minor increase of  xxxg1144xxx  affinity is not sufficient to provide a
mitogenic stimulus of this cell line. a similar result was found
in studies using human mammary epithelial cells (10).
1003

in vitro comparison of insulin analogs

however, a sustained activation of the  xxxg1194xxx 
might also contribute to provide the mitogenic response of the
insulin analogs in the applied cell line. thus, for insulin
b10asp, which dissociated slowly from the  xxxg1194xxx 
and was also more potent than  xxxd2364xxx  in binding to
the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor, the relative mitogenic potency was higher
than expected from the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity, suggesting
that the decreased  xxxg1194xxx  dissociation rate was
involved. similarly, the more rapid dissociation of insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  than of  xxxd2364xxx  from the  xxxg1194xxx  might
contribute to the low mitogenic potential of this analog.
however, to resolve the relative contribution of  xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding and sustained signaling from the  xxxg1194xxx 
to stimulation of saos/b10 cell growth, we would need a
slowly dissociating analog that binds the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor with
the same affinity as  xxxd2364xxx .
the 6- to 8-fold increased  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity and mitogenic potency of insulin  xxxd2362xxx  found in this study is somewhat greater than previously reported. thus, bähr et al. (29)
found that  xxxd2362xxx  was only slightly more potent than human
insulin in binding to the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor and stimulating dna
synthesis of h9 myotubes. berti et al. (30) found similar
growth-stimulating effects of  xxxd2362xxx  and  xxxd2364xxx 
using rat-1 fibroblasts. however, none of these studies
allowed for exact calculation of mitogenic potencies. the
observed differences are most likely due to different  xxxg1144xxx 
and/or  xxxg1194xxx  densities in the applied cell lines.
it is interesting to note that the dose-response profiles for
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding and stimulation of mitogenesis of
saos/b10 cells do not superimpose. thus, the ec50 value of
 xxxd2364xxx  for stimulation of dna synthesis is ~4 nmol/l,
whereas the ic50 value for insulin binding to the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor is ~100-fold greater (data not shown). a similar relationship between potencies for  xxxg1144xxx  receptor binding and stimulation of cell growth was observed using human mammary
epithelial cells (10). this relationship implies that only a small
fraction of  xxxg1144xxx  receptors need to be activated to fully activate mitogenesis. alternatively, it can be speculated that
hybrid insulin/ xxxg1144xxx  receptors (31–33) might be implicated in
mediating the mitogenic response of insulin in these cell lines.
toxico-pharmacological implications. an elevation of
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity and mitogenic potency compared
with  xxxd2364xxx  can potentially lead to undesired toxicological effects of insulin analogs. however, it is not easy
to assess to what extent an  xxxg1144xxx  receptor–mediated effect
of insulin can add to the biological response of endogenous
 xxxg1144xxx . the total plasma levels of endogenous  xxxg1144xxx  are high
(20–80 nmol/l), but  xxxg1144xxx  is almost completely bound (>95%)
to specific binding proteins, and the concentration of free
 xxxg1144xxx  in the bloodstream is therefore much lower than the
total concentration (34,35). furthermore, insulin-resistant
type 2 diabetic patients show plasma levels of insulin that are
severalfold greater than normal physiological insulin concentrations. hence, it cannot be excluded that insulin
analogs with a relatively high affinity for  xxxg1144xxx  receptors
can have  xxxg1144xxx  receptor–mediated effects in vivo.
 xxxg1144xxx  has a variety of physiological effects on growth and
differentiation and is implicated in mediating the effect of
growth hormone (34,36). an increased  xxxg1144xxx  receptor activation could precipitate pathological effects. thus, stimulation of the growth hormone/ xxxg1144xxx  axis has been implicated in
various pathological conditions, including mammary, ovarian,
1004

and bone tumor development (37,38) and development of
retinopathy (39–42) and diabetic nephropathy (43). accordingly, in the clinical trials of  xxxg1144xxx  that have now been terminated, these potential side effects were given special attention
(44,45). interestingly, a recent clinical case report suggested
that insulin lispro, which has a slightly increased  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity compared with  xxxd2364xxx , might enhance the
development of diabetic retinopathy. however, because this
was a case report, there was no control group, and the
observed development of retinopathy might have been due to
other factors, e.g., a more rapid tightening of glycemic control after treatment with lispro (46).
conclusion. after more than 50 years of treatment with animal insulins, recombinant dna technologies and advanced
protein chemistry (47–49) made  xxxd2364xxx  preparations
available in the early 1980s. over the last decade, a number of
insulin analogs have been constructed with the aim of providing the diabetic patient with the most efficient, reproducible, and convenient therapy possible. it is imperative that
these benefits are not achieved at the cost of the safety profile of the native human hormone.
the results presented in this study show that the amino acid
modifications in the 2 rapid-acting insulin analogs, lispro and
aspart, had no significant influence on metabolic or mitogenic
potency. in contrast, the 2 long-acting analogs, insulin  xxxd2361xxx 
and insulin  xxxd2362xxx , both showed in vitro properties that differed
significantly from  xxxd2364xxx . the clinical safety implications of the elevated  xxxg1144xxx  receptor affinity and mitogenic
potency of insulin  xxxd2362xxx  are not clear. in contrast, insulin
 xxxd2361xxx  was less potent than  xxxd2364xxx  in binding to the
 xxxg1144xxx  receptor and stimulating mitogenesis as well as in binding to the  xxxg1194xxx  and stimulating lipogenesis. hence,
the in vitro profile of insulin  xxxd2361xxx  did not cause any safety concerns. the relatively low in vitro potency of insulin  xxxd2361xxx 
may, however, contribute to explanations of why this analog is
not as effective on a molar basis as  xxxd2364xxx  in humans.
