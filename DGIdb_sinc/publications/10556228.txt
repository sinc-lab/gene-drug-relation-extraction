electrophysiological and antiarrhythmic effects of the atrial selective 5-ht(4) receptor antagonist rs-100302 in experimental atrial flutter and fi...  stimulation of 5-ht(4) receptors increases atrial chronotropic and inotropic responses. whether other electrophysiological effects are produced is unknown. in humans and swine, 5-ht(4) receptors are present only in atrium. therefore, the effects of a novel 5-ht(4) receptor antagonist, rs-100302, and the partial agonist  xxxd1708xxx  on atrial flutter and fibrillation induced in swine were studied to delineate the role of the 5-ht(4) receptor in modulating atrial electrophysiological properties and the antiarrhythmic potential of rs-100302.
