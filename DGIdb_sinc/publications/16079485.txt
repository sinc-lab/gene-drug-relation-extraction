the antifungal activity of zj-522, a new triazole antifungal agent restructured from fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx , was compared to that of fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx  against 43 strains of fungi representing 13 fungal
species. mics were determined by using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls)recommended broth microdilution method for yeasts, which was modified for filamentous fungi. zj-522 was
about 50-fold and 2 to 16-fold more potent than fluconazole against yeasts and filamentous fungi respectively, but
it was less active than  xxxd394xxx  against filamentous fungi, although  xxxd394xxx  was inactive against most yeasts.
thus, the fashion of zj-522 antifungal activity more similar to that of fluconazole than that of  xxxd394xxx  indicates that zj-522 should be an inhibitor of lanosterol 14a -demethylase but not of  xxxg2197xxx , and should
be a candidate for clinical development.

in the last 20 years, the frequency of fungal infections has
dramatically increased because of factors such as intensive
care practices, the use of indwelling catheters, human immunodeficiency virus infection, organ transplantation, therapies using anticancer agents, and other immunosuspressive
conditions.1—4) candida albicans is the organism most often
associated with both mucosal and hematogenously disseminated infections,5—7) and recently, other candida spp. such as
candida parapsilosis, candida glabrata and candida tropicalis have emerged as clinically important pathogens.6,8,9)
cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus spp. are also important pathogens which cause serious infections.10,11)
fluconazole has been developed so far to be used widely
in antifungal therapies over the last decade because of its
high efficiency, low toxicity, and being well delivered and absorbed.12) whereas, its activity is limited, especially because
of its failure against filamentous fungi13) and the increasing
number of fungi strains resistant to fluconazole.14) therefore,
great efforts have been made to modify the chemical structure of fluconazole in order to broaden its antifungal spectrum of activity and to increase its potency.15,16)
as we know, fluconazole has antifungal activity against
yeasts because it can inhibit the fungal enzyme lanosterol
14a -demethylase, thereby blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes.17)  xxxd394xxx  hydrochloride, a synthetic  xxxd314xxx 
derivative with a mode of action similar to that of the allylamine class of antifungal drugs, also can block the biosynthesis of ergosterol by inhibitting the fungal enzyme  xxxg2197xxx .18) unlike fluconazole, the antifungal spectrum of  xxxd394xxx  includes many filamentous fungi. while
fluconazole is generally fungistatic to yeasts,  xxxd394xxx  is
fungicidal to many strains of filamentous fungi.19) squalene,
blocked by  xxxd394xxx , is believed to have an effect of killing
cells of fungi directly when it reaches a high accumulation.
so, a new antifungal agent, zj-522 (fig. 1), restructured
from fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx , was designed and synthe∗ to whom correspondence should be addressed.

sized.20) it was thought to be a inhibitor of both fungal enzyme lanosterol 14a -demethylase and  xxxg2197xxx ,
and have antifungal activity like fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx .
this study reports the in vitro antifungal activity of zj-522
against clinical isolates from 13 species of clinically important fungi compared with fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx .
materials and methods
drugs powder fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx  were obtained
from their respective manufacturers and stored at 70 °c
until use. zj-522 was synthesized in the department of medical chemistry, school of pharmacy, the second military
medical university (shanghai, china), as its yellow powder.
the three powders, whether they were water soluble or not,
were prepared in undiluted  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) at a
concentration of 3.2 mg/ml and stored in 0.1-ml aliquots at
70 °c until it was needed.
yeast a total of 45 strains from 13 fungal species were
used in this study. candida parapsilosis atcc 22019 and
candida krusei atcc 22492 were obtained from the depart-

ment of dermatology, the frist hospital of beijing university (beijing, china). the other 43 clinical isolates, including
12 candida albicans, 7 cryptococcus neoformans, 3 aspergillus fumigatus, and 2 respective candida parapsilosis,
candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, fonsecaea pedrosoi,
fonsecaea compacta, sporothrix schenckii, microsporum
canis, microsporum gypseum, trichophyto mentagrophytes
and trichophyton rubrum, were provided by the department
of dermatology, changhai hospital (shanghai, china). the
isolates were stored in yeast nitrogen base (ynb, difco laboratories, detroit, mich.) with 2% (wt/vol) glucose and 10%
(vol/vol) glycerol at 70 °c when they were not in active
use, and repeatedly subcultured on sabouraud dextrose agar
plates. they were incubated overnight at 35 °c before test.
antifungal susceptibility testing the mics for yeast
were determined by a broth microdilution method based on
the nccls method outlined in documents m27-t b21) and
m27-a,22) with slight modifications.16,23) rpmi 1640
medium buffered to ph 7.0 with 3-(n-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid (mops) at a final concentration of 0.165 m was
used as the culture medium, and the inoculum size was
1103 to 5103 cells/ml. the final concentrations of the antifungal agents ranged from 0.0625 to 32 m g/ml for fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx , 0.001 to 32 m g/ml for zj-522. the microdilution plates inoculated with the fungi were incubated at
35 °c. mic endpoints for candida spp. were determined
after incubation for 24 h, and for c. neoformans, mic endpoints were determined after incubation for 72 h. these endpoints were defined as the lowest concentration that produced
an 80% reduction of growth compared with that of the drugfree growth control. the mics for filamentous fungi were
determined by the broth microdilution method.24) rpmi 1640
medium buffered to ph 7.0 with mops was used as the culture medium. the inoculum was prepared by suspending
conidia of filamentous fungi in phosphate-buffered saline
containing 0.05% tween 80. the conidia were counted using
a hemocytometer and then diluted into the growth medium to
a concentration of 1104 conidia/ml. a drug free positive
control was included for each isolate. the microdilution
plates were incubated in moist chambers at 30 °c for 5 d. the
mics were read visually and were defined using a no-growth
end point. c. parapsilosis atcc 22019 and c. krusei atcc
6258 were used as quality control organisms.
results and discussion
antifungal activities against fungal pathogens of zj-522
were investigated by measuring their mic using the nccls
microbroth dilution method. fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx ,
from which zj-522 was restructured, were used as standard
agent for the evaluation of its activities (table 1). table 2
summarizes the mics of zj-522, fluconazole, and  xxxd394xxx 
for the 45 clinical isolates from 13 fungal species. overall,
zj-522 was highly active against all isolates of candida spp.
mics required to inhibit 50 and 90% of the strains (mic50
and mic90, respectively) of zj-522 against candida spp.
were 0.031 and 0.125 m g/ml, respectively. c. albicans were
the most susceptible species (mic50 and mic90 were 0.031
and 0.062 m g/ml, respectively). fluconazole was less active
than zj-522 against all isolates of candida spp. (mic50 and
mic90 were 8 and 32 m g/ml). all isolates of candida spp.

1415

were resistant to  xxxd394xxx  (mic rang, 16—64 m g/ml).
while all cryptococcus neoformans strains were resistant to
fluconazole (mic rang, 8—64 m g/ml),  xxxd394xxx  was
more active against them (mic rang, 1—8 m g/ml), but zj522 was still the most active agent (mic rang, 0.062—
2 m g/ml). although zj-522 was also more active (mic50 and
mic90 were 1 and 4 m g/ml, respectively) than fluconazole
(mic50 and mic90 were 4 and 16 m g/ml, respectively) against
all species of filamentous fungi except trichophyton rubrum
and aspergillus fumigatus, especially being 8 to 32 fold superior to fluconazole against fonsecaea spp., it was still far
less active than  xxxd394xxx  against them (mic50 and mic90
were 0.125 and 1 m g/ml, respectively).
the most exciting observation was the remarkably good
activity zj-522 demonstrated (mic rang, 0.031 to
0.125 m g/ml) against 4 strains of candida spp. (3 c.
albicans, 1 c. glabrata) for which fluconazole mics were
high (mics, 16 m g/ml), demonstrating that zj-522 essentially had the same activity for both fluconazole-susceptible
and fluconazole-resistant strains of candida spp. moreover,
zj-522 also demonstrated 32—500 fold superior to fluconazole against 10 isolates of clinical cryptococcus neoformans.
in the present study, zj-522 demonstrated great potential
as a novel antifungal compound with potent in vitro antifungal activity against c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. tropicalis,
and c. parapsilosis, the four most commonly isolated species
causing disseminated and mucocutaneous candidiasis, and
against cryptococcus neoformans, the species causing a severe clinical problem recently. therefore, zj-522 should be
particularly useful for the management of these clinically
fungal infections.
while inhibitors of lanosterol 14a -demethylase such as
azoles always show more active against yeast than against filamentous, inhibitors of squalene epoxidas such as  xxxd314xxx  and allylamine show more active against filamentous
than against yeast. the result that zj-522 was more active
against yeast than against filamentous fungi demonstrates
that the fashion of zj-522 antifungal activity is more similar
to that of fluconazole than that of  xxxd394xxx . this indicates
that zj-522, restructured from both fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx , shows more likely to be a inhibitor of lanosterol 14a demethylase as fluconazole than to be a inhibitor of squalene
epoxidase as  xxxd394xxx .
in summary, zj-522, a new triazole antifungal agent, restructured from fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx , was shown to
have broad-spectrum and potent activities against clinically
important yeast compared with fluconazole and  xxxd394xxx ,
and to be a candidate for clinical development. in view of the
potent in vitro activity demonstrated here, zj-522 warrants
further investigation for its antifungal activities and the
mechanisms.
