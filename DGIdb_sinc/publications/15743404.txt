summary
1. vascular resistance and sensitivity to circulating pressor
and vasoconstrictor substances are blunted during pregnancy.
this has been attributed mainly to an increased production of
endothelium-derived mediators. the aim of the present study
was to determine whether pregnancy changes the relative
participation of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) and prostaglandins (pg) in
the modulation of the contractile response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) in two anatomically distint segments of the rat
aorta.
2. full concentration–response curves to 5-ht were
obtained in isolated rings from the thoracic and abdominal
portion of the aorta from pregnant and non-pregnant rats in
the presence and absence of the no synthase (nos) inhibitor
ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name; 10 mol/l) or the
pg synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 mol/l). cyclooxygenase (cox)-1, cox-2 and endothelial (e) nos protein
expression were determined in the same tissues by immunoblot.
3. the effects of pregnancy were accentuated in the
abdominal compared with the thoracic aorta. in addition, the
relative participation of the no and pg pathways seems to be
changed during pregnancy. although no seems to be the
mediator mainly responsible for the effect of pregnancy in the
thoracic aorta, our results suggest a complex interaction
between no and pg in the abdominal aorta. indomethacin
significantly reduced the contractile response of both segments
of the aorta, whereas expression of  xxxg1883xxx , cox-2 and enos
were increased only in the abdominal segment of pregnant
animals.
4. these results show that the effect of pregnancy is not
homogeneous along the aorta. there seems to be a mutual
interaction between pg and no in the abdominal, but not in

introduction
an increased production of endothelium-derived vasodilator
mediators has been postulated as the main mechanism responsible
for pregnancy induced decreased blood pressure and a blunted
response to vasoconstrictors in both humans1,2 and rats.3,4 these
physiological changes have been attributed mainly to the
characteristic hormonal environment that, in turn, gives rise to an
increased synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factors.
indeed, circulating  xxxd2738xxx  (no)5–7 and several prostaglandins
(pg) and their major metabolites were found to be increased during
human and rat pregnancy.8,9 however the role of these mediators
in the systemic vasculature remains controversial.6,10,11
the effect of pregnancy may vary depending on the vascular
territory under investigation. furthermore, the effects of pregnancy
do not seem to be homogeneous along the aorta. indeed, a regional
variation of aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation has been
described during guinea-pig11,12 and rat13 pregnancy and the
distribution of oestrogen receptors has been identified as increasing
in concentration moving proximal to distal along the aorta.14
therefore, the regional variation in the participation of no and pg
in vascular tone could be related to differential sensitivity to the
hormonal influence associated with the mechanisms that reflect the
interaction between smooth muscle activation and the release of
endothelial substances.
furthermore, locally produced vasoactive mediators that
participate in the regulation of smooth muscle tone seem to change
along the anatomical segments of the aorta. in this way, differences
in smooth muscle contraction induced with -adrenoceptor
agonists,15,16 in the relaxant responses to acetylcholine (ach)17 and
in the mediators responsible for ach-induced relaxation17,18
between thoracic and abdominal aorta have been described. a
more pronounced increase in inositol phosphate (ip) formation in

effect of pregnancy on two aortic segments
the thoracic compared with the abdominal aorta in response to
noradrenaline has been found.19 in addition, inhibition of pg
synthesis with indomethacin significantly reduced phenylephrineinduced contractions in the abdominal, but not the thoracic, aorta,20
a phenomenon that could not be explained by segmental differences in adrenoceptor subtype population.21 indeed, asbun-bojalil
et al.21 found that the phenylephrine-induced contraction in the
abdominal, but not the thoracic, aorta is mediated, in part, by a
prostanoid of vascular smooth muscle origin.
we hypothesized that the effect of pregnancy on the contractile
response induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) in two segments
of the aorta could be different owing to changes in the relative
participation of no and pg.

methods
experiments were performed with aortic vascular tissue prepared from
pregnant (day 18–21) and non-pregnant (in any phase of the oestrous cycle)
female wistar rats. this period of pregnancy was chosen because the
vascular effects of gestation were more evident at the end of the 3rd week
compared with the 1st and 2nd weeks of pregnancy. the bodyweight of
animals before pregnancy was 200  20 g. animals were maintained in the
animal colony until they were killed and were kept under a 12 h light–dark
cycle and constant temperature (22  2c), with food and water available
freely in the home cages. experiments were conducted under protocols
approved by the animal care committee of the escuela superior de
medicina del ipn and the mexican official norm (nom-062-zoo-1969)
regarding technical specifications for the production, care and use of
laboratory animals.

isolated vascular preparation
after slight anaesthesia with ether, rats were killed by a blow to the head.
immediately, a midline laparotomy was performed and the entire descending aorta was excised and placed in iced oxygenated krebs’ solution with
the following composition (in mmol/l): nacl 118; kcl 4.8; kh2po4 1.2;
 xxxd2534xxx ·7h2o 1.2; cacl2·2h2o 2.5; nahco3 25.0; dextrose 11.7; calcium
disodium edta 0.026; propranolol 0.010. specimens were cleaned of
adherent fat and adjacent connective tissues. two rings from each aortic

203

segment (thoracic and abdominal) were used in each experiment. each ring
was threaded onto two nichrome hooks and suspended between the
stationary bottom of the chamber and an isometric force transducer
(statham ft03; grass instruments, cleveland, oh, usa) connected to a
model 7d grass polygraph (quincy, ma, usa) in an isolated organ
chamber of 10 ml capacity containing krebs’ buffer, ph 7.4, heated to
37c and aerated with 95% o2/5% co2 for the measurement of isometric
force. rings were stretched to optimal tension and, afterwards, responses to
phenylephrine (10–7 mol/l) were obtained every 20 min until maximal
reactivity was observed. the functional integrity of the endothelium was
assessed pharmacologically by an immediate relaxation induced by ach
(1 mol/l) in rings precontracted with phenylephrine (1 mol/l).

experimental protocols
cumulative concentration–response curves were constructed in aortic rings
from term pregnant (days 20–21) and female non-pregnant (any day of the
oestrous cycle) rats. contractions were elicited with 5-ht. to determine
the participation of no, aortic rings were pretreated with a selective
no synthase (nos) inhibitor, namely ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester
(l-name; 10 mol/l) for 30 min prior to measurement of responses. to
determine the participation of cyclo-oxygenase (cox) products, vascular
rings were pretreated with indomethacin (10 mol/l), as mentioned above,
at a concentration reported to effectively inhibit  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2,22
before the concentration–response curves were constructed.

drugs
fresh solutions of the following drugs were prepared for each experiment:
5-ht, l-name and indomethacin (all from sigma chemical, st louis,
mo, usa). drugs were dissolved in distilled water (stock solutions) and
dilutions were prepared with krebs’ solution.  xxxd3212xxx  3.5% was
used to bring indomethacin into solution. all drug concentrations are
expressed as the final molar concentration in the organ chamber.

data analysis
each experimental group included six to eight animals. data are expressed
as the meansem. concentrations of 5-ht producing a half-maximal
contractile effect (ic50) were estimated by linear regression analysis (fitted

as –log ic50 and percentage of maximal contraction. statistical evaluation
of the data was performed by two-way anova with bonferroni’s t-test for
multiple comparisons and student’s t-test. in all comparisons, p < 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistically significantly differences between the
means.

immunoblot
we determined protein expression of  xxxg1883xxx , cox-2 and endothelial (e)
nos by western blot comparing the thoracic and abdominal aorta from
another set of control and pregnant rats. at the end of pregnancy, animals
were anaesthetized in an ether chamber and killed to obtain the aorta.
vessels were divided into abdominal and thoracic portions. aortic tissues

were homogenized with a polytron homogenizer (ishii laboratory works,
tokyo, japan) in tris 100 mmol/l, ph 7.4, using a cocktail of protease
inhibitors, centrifuged at 8000 g, for 10 min at 4c and the protein concentration measured in the supernatant. protein (75 g for each sample) was
loaded onto an 8%  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) under reducing conditions. afterwards, proteins in
the gel were transferred to polivinyldiene fluoride (pvdf) membranes
using a semidry system (biorad, hercules, ca, usa). membranes were
incubated with anti- xxxg1883xxx , anti-cox-2 or anti-nos 3 polyclonal antibodies (santa cruz, santa cruz, ca, usa) overnight. secondary antibodies
with horseradish peroxidase were used and bands were identified by
chemiluminiscence. membranes were photographed and the image
digitalized to measure band density using a program from biorad (quantity
one). the relative presence of each enzyme was normalized with the
reference protein -actin. for all experiments, data are presented as the

aorta (ec50 0.54  0.04 vs 3.81  0.04 mol/l in abdominal and
thoracic aortas from non-pregnant rats, respectively; p < 0.01), an

inhibition of no production with l-name (10 mol/l) significantly increased the emax response of the thoracic aorta from
pregnant and non-pregnant rats (fig. 3). in contrast, nos inhibition did not modify the concentration–response curves to 5-ht of
the abdominal aorta, independent of gestation (fig. 4).

incubation of tissues from preganant rats with indomethacin
(10 mol/l) produced a right-ward shift and decreased emax of the
concentration–response curves to 5-ht for the thoracic aorta (ec50

indomethacin-treated tissues, respectively; p < 0.01; figure 6). no
significant changes were observed in either aortic segment from
non-pregnant animals.

enzyme determination by immunoblot
we found that there were no differences in the quantity of protein
of either of the two isoforms of cox between the two segments of

in the present study, we found a blunted response to 5-ht in both
segments of the aorta from pregnant rats. our results confirm
previous findings related to a pregnancy conditioned blunted
response to other vasoconstrictors23–25 in isolated vessels under
similar experimental conditions. thus, pregnancy seems to change
the local release of vascular mediators, but the contribution of other
systemic mechanisms must also be taken into account.
5-hydroxytryptamine was used as a contracting agent because
its effect in two different segments of the rat aorta has not been
explored previously. in addition, 5-ht is recognized as an important endogenous uterotonic compound. human placenta both
produces and is a target organ for 5-ht26 and plasma levels of this
amine have been found to be significantly elevated in pregnancy.27
a change in sensitivity to 5-ht has been described in umbilicoplacental vessels during the third trimester of human pregnancy.28
furthermore, 5-ht has been implicated as one of the multiple
mediators involved in pre-eclampsia.28
dieye and gairard29 showed that the aortic response to vasoconstrictors is modulated by extracellular calcium concentration in a
different way between pregnant and non-pregnant rats, suggesting
that the hormonal enviornment of pregnancy modifies the activity
and/or expression of endothelium-derived mediators. in fact, an
increased no synthesis occurs during pregnancy,30,31 which may,
therefore, play a role in modulating the blunted vascular reactivity
observed during this physiological stage.
the effect of pregnancy on vascular contractility seems to
change according to the vascular territory under investigation.32

effect of pregnancy on two aortic segments

207

there is also some evidence suggesting that the effect of pregnancy
may vary along the same vessel. a regional variation in the release
of no in the guinea-pig aorta has been described in association
with pregnancy.12 therefore, in the present study, we examined
whether the effect of pregnancy was different in two segments of
the rat aorta. we observed that pregnancy reduced the contractile
response to 5-ht with a more pronounced effect in the abdominal
compared with the thoracic aorta, confirming that the effect of
pregnancy is not homogeneous along this conductance vessel.
the main purpose of the present investigation was to determine
whether pregnancy differentially changes no and pg participation
in the modulation of 5-ht-induced contractions of the thoracic and
abdominal segments of the rat aorta.
because enos plays an important role in controlling vascular
tone, we investigated the no system. incubation of isolated aortic
rings with l-name (10 mol/l) increased the 5-ht-induced
response of the thoracic, but not the abdominal, aorta from
pregnant and non-pregnant rats. in contrast, when we measured
enos protein expression levels, increased enos protein expression was found in the abdominal, but not in the thoracic, segment
of the aorta of pregnant compared with non-pregnant animals. this
finding supports the idea of a segment-dependent participation
of vascular active mediators. the observed increase in enos
protein expression in the abdominal aortic segment was
unexpected because it has been postulated18,33 that no is the main
endothelium-derived vasodilator in the thoracic aorta. the increase
in enos protein expression during normal pregnancy in the
abdominal but not the thoracic aorta could be developed as a
mechanism to fulfill the increased blood flow demand in the
vascular territory near the fetoplacental unit and to act as a reserve
mechanism, because its role is only evident in the absence of cox
products. this interpretation is supported by previous findings of
increased no production in both the thoracic and the abdominal
segments of the aorta of pregnant compared with non-pregnant
rats.13
however, an increase in enos protein expression does not
necessarily represent an increase in no production. a decrease in

enos enzyme activity could result in no net change in no
production by the enos isoform in the aortic tissue.
as means of investigating the pg pathway, isolated vessels were
incubated with indomethacin (10 mol/l). under these conditions,
5-ht elicited a decreased response in vessels from pregnant rats,
particularly in the abdominal aorta. in addition, increased protein
expression of both  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 isoenzymes was found in the
abdominal aorta during normal pregnancy. considering that
indomethacin inhibits both vasodilator and vasoconstrictor pg, our
results suggest an imbalanced participation of a cox-dependent
vasoconstrictor in the abdominal aorta during pregnancy, such as
pgh2 or 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-hete; because
levels of both pgi2 and thromboxane a2 synthases are decreased
in aortas from pregnant rats).10 the contribution of a vasoconstrictor pg in the abdominal aorta has been established previously
in non-pregnant animals.20,21 the dampened response to 5-ht in
the presence of an increased participation of a constrictory pg in
pregnant animals is difficult to intepret. it can be explained if there
is a simultaneous increase in other vasodilator substances that fade
the pg effect.
nevertheless, these results can also be interpreted by an
increased participation of no or another vasodilator substance,
such as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, in the modulation of the contractile response to 5-ht that become evident in
the absence of pg during pregnancy.
although no seems to be the main mediator in the thoracic aorta
from pregnant and non-pregnant rats, increased  xxxg1883xxx , cox-2
and enos protein expression was found in the abdominal, but not
the thoracic, segment of the aorta during pregnancy. even though
the results of the present study are difficult to interpret and may
reflect the complex nature of the physiological state induced by
pregnancy, this apparent functional–molecular biology disagreement can be explained by considering that enzyme activity may be
independent of protein expression.34–36
taken toghether, these data suggest no and pg may have a
compensatory interaction, behaving as a reserve vasodilatory
mechanism in the abdominal aorta during pregnancy. several lines

of evidence support the concept that vasoactive substances
(particularly no and pg) may interact, with mutual modulation of
synthesis or disposition.37–40 further studies with specific inhibitors
of vasodilatory pg will be necessary to determine whether this
hypothesis is correct.
finally, in the present study we examined whether the thoracic
and abdominal aortas had similar responses to 5-ht. we found an
increased sensitivity to 5-ht in the abdominal compared with the
thoracic segment of the aorta of both pregnant and non-pregnant
animals. this is in agreement with previous work describing
segmental vascular differences in the aorta from rats and rabbits in
response to vasoactive sustances.15,16,41 indeed, ip production in
response to noradrenaline is greater in the thoracic than the
abdominal aorta19 (probably explained by differences in cox or
nos activation), whereas no differences in adrenoceptor subtypes
between these two segments have been found.21 differences in
the endothelium-derived mediators evoked by 5-ht-induced vasoconstriction or in the receptor subtype population need to be
investigated further.
in conclusion, pregnancy seems to have a more pronounced
effect in the vascular territory nearer to the uterus, increasing the
expression of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of no and
of vasodilator or vasocontractile pg in the abdominal compared
with the thoracic aorta. then, during pregnancy, an interaction
between pg and no may work as a mutual compensatory
mechanism in the abdominal aorta, ensuring that the participation
of one relaxant agonist will increase in case the participation of the
other decreases.
