abstract
elevated plasma et-1 levels have been reported in several conditions such as stress and diabetes. et-1 is found to cause insulin resistance
and to stimulate liver glycogenolysis. the question arises whether et-1 has a role in the metabolic changes occurring in such conditions.
to test this, we studied the possible effect of the endothelin receptor antagonist,  xxxd358xxx  (50 and 100 mg kg−1 ) on serum glucose and
insulin levels as well as on liver glycogen contents in normoglycemic stressed animals. in addition, the effect of  xxxd358xxx  on serum glucose
and insulin levels in both mild and severely diabetic rats and its effect on insulin-induced hypoglycemia were also determined. restraining
water immersion stress was used as a model for severe stress reported to elevate plasma et-1 level. mild diabetes was induced in rats by
intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of  xxxd3249xxx  (38 mg kg−1 ) while severe diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of
a higher dose of  xxxd3249xxx  (45 mg kg−1 ).  xxxd358xxx  partially prevented stress-induced both hyperglycemia and decrease in glycogen
content while it completely blocked the stress-induced decrease in insulin level in normoglycemic stressed rats.  xxxd358xxx  also decreased
serum glucose level without any effect on insulin secretion in mild diabetic rats and potentiated the hypoglycemic action of insulin.

1. introduction
it is well-established that hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance may occur under conditions of severe stress, such
as trauma, burn, operation, or myocardial infarction in patients without prior history of diabetes [1]. such circumstances are accompanied by marked increases in plasma
glucagon, catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine),
and glucocorticoids as well as decrease in plasma insulin, all
of which may contribute to hyperglycemia. recent findings
incorporate  xxxg674xxx , the most potent constrictor discovered to date, as a new mediator in stress [2,3]. increase in endogenous  xxxg674xxx  due to stress suggested the possibility that endothelin may participate in the metabolic changes
caused by stress. elevated et-1 levels in the plasma have
been reported in patients with insulin resistance, such as
that resulting from type ii diabetes [4]. in addition, et-1
is reported to induce insulin resistance in rat adipocytes [5]
and rat arterial smooth muscle cells in vitro [6] and in conscious rats in vivo [7]. in healthy humans, exogenous administration of et-1 has also been found to induce insulin

resistance by reducing insulin-dependent glucose uptake in
skeletal muscle, without decreasing skeletal muscle blood
flow [8]. et-1 also caused a rapid and sustained stimulation
of glycogenolysis and resulted in a dose-dependent hepatic
glucose production [9,10]. interestingly, a negative correlation between total glucose uptake and circulating et-1 levels
was demonstrated by ferri et al. [11]. all these in vitro studies demonstrated that et-1 could antagonize insulin actions
of facilitating glucose transport or inhibiting glycogenolysis.
these considerations prompted us to investigate the effect
of  xxxd358xxx , an orally active non-peptide mixed eta /etb
receptor antagonist, on serum glucose and insulin levels in
both stressed and diabetic rats.

2. materials and methods
2.1. experimental animals
adult male sprague–dawley rats weighing 150–200 g

2.2. drugs and chemicals
 xxxd358xxx  ( xxxd358xxx ) was obtained as a generous gift
from dr. martine clozel (f. hoffman la roche ltd., basel,
switzerland).
crystalline (regular) insulin (actrapid, novo nordisk,
bagsvaerd, denmark) was used in this study.
 xxxd3249xxx  (stz) was purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo, usa) and dissolved in citrate buffer,
ph 4.5 [12]. anthrone was purchased from sigma chemical
co. all other chemicals used in this study are of analytical
grade.
2.3. effect of  xxxd358xxx  on serum glucose and insulin levels
as well as liver glycogen contents of normoglycemic rats
subjected to restraining-water immersion stress
rats were divided into four groups each of six rats.
they were fasted for 16 h and treated with  xxxd358xxx  or the
vehicle orally as follows. the first group received  xxxd358xxx  (50 mg kg−1 ) as 2% suspension in 5% gum arabic,
the second group received  xxxd358xxx  (100 mg kg−1 ) as 4%
suspension in 5% gum arabic, the third group received
equivalent volume (2.5 ml kg−1 ) of 5% gum arabic (control
stressed group). the three groups of rats were subjected
to restraining-water immersion stress (rwis) as described
by said and el-mowafy [3] after 2 h of  xxxd358xxx  or vehicle treatment. rats were lightly anesthetized with ether,
restrained on a wooden plate and immersed vertically in
water to the level of xiphoid process in a water bath thermostatically controlled at 23 ± 1 ◦ c, for 60 min. immersion of
the animals started after the ether anesthesia was stopped,
to prevent any effect of the anesthetic. blood samples were
collected, from retro-orbital sinus, before  xxxd358xxx  or vehicle treatment, after 2 h treatment and at the end of stress
period. the determination of serum glucose was performed
by enzymatic method described by trinder [13] using glucose oxidase kit (bio merieux, marcy l’ etoile, france)
and serum insulin by using eia kit (drg instruments
gmbh, germany). liver was taken for glycogen determination by anthrone [14]. the fourth group of rats received
equivalent volume (2.5 ml kg−1 ) of 5% gum arabic (control
non-stressed group). rats in this group were also killed
at the end of the experiment and liver was excised for
glycogen determination.
2.4. effect of  xxxd358xxx  on serum glucose and insulin levels
in mild and severe diabetic rats
mild diabetes was produced in rats aged 9–10 weeks
by i.p. injection of a low dose (38 mg kg−1 ) of stz
[15], where partial destruction of pancreatic beta cell
mass occurred mimicking the clinical picture of type ii
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm). severe diabetes was produced in rats aged 9–10 weeks by
i.p. injection of a higher dose (45 mg kg−1 ) of stz [16],

where nearly complete destruction of pancreatic beta cell
mass occurred mimicking the clinical picture of type i
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( xxxg1193xxx ). three groups
each comprised of six mild diabetic rats were treated with
50 mg kg−1  xxxd358xxx , 100 mg kg−1  xxxd358xxx , or the vehicle
and another three groups each of six severe diabetic rats
received the same previous treatment. blood samples were
collected before treatment, after 2, 4, and 6 h from treatment
for determination of serum glucose and insulin levels.
2.5. effect of  xxxd358xxx  on oral glucose tolerance test in
mild diabetic rats
three groups each of six mild diabetic rats treated with
50 mg kg−1  xxxd358xxx , 100 mg kg−1  xxxd358xxx , or the vehicle
and one group of six normoglycemic rats received the vehicle before the oral glucose tolerance test. rats underwent an
oral-glucose-tolerance test (ogtt) after an overnight fast
[7]. two hours after vehicle or  xxxd358xxx  administration, a
zero-min blood sample was taken from each rat. then without delaying, rats were given a glucose solution, 2 g kg−1
of 20% glucose solution administered by gavage. five more
blood samples were collected at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180
min. serum glucose level was determined.
2.6. effect of  xxxd358xxx  on insulin-induced hypoglycemic
effect in severe diabetic rats
two groups of severe diabetic rats each comprised 11 animals were used in this study. the first group received  xxxd358xxx  50 mg kg−1 orally. the second group received equivalent
volume of the vehicle. two hours after treatment, each rat
was injected subcutaneously with 4 units kg−1 of crystalline
insulin [17]. blood samples were collected 2 h after  xxxd358xxx  or vehicle treatment, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after insulin
treatment for determination of serum glucose levels.
2.7. statistical analysis
results are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. statistical analysis was performed by the aid of the computer program (instat
graphpad) by using one-way analysis of variance (anova)
followed by tukey–kramer multiple comparisons test in
case of more than two groups. student’s unpaired t-test was
used in case of comparing two groups. paired t-test was used
as a test of significance for comparison between two arithmetic means of the same subject before and after treatment.
significance was assumed when p-value was less than 0.05.

between the effect of the two doses of  xxxd358xxx  on serum
glucose levels after 2 and 4 h treatment (fig. 4).  xxxd358xxx  (50 and 100 mg kg−1 ) did not produce any significant
change in serum insulin levels at 2, 4, and 6 h after treatment when compared to the corresponding initial value
(fig. 5).

the oral administration of a glucose load (2 g kg−1 ) to
control non-diabetic rats produced increase in the serum glucose level after 30 min of glucose administration and reached
its maximal value (160.85 ± 9.78 mg dl−1 ) after 1 h then progressively decreased until it nearly reached its initial value
(114.57 ± 5.86 mg dl−1 ) 3 h after oral glucose administration. oral administration of 2 g kg−1 glucose to control mild
diabetic rats also produced increase in the serum glucose
level after 30 min of glucose administration and reached its
maximal value (336.25 ± 19.47 mg dl−1 ) after 2 h then decreased at a slower rate and was still significantly higher
after 3 h showing an impaired ogtt (fig. 6).
pretreatment of mild diabetic rats with 50 mg kg−1  xxxd358xxx  for 2 h before starting the ogtt showed improved oral
glucose tolerance as serum glucose increased after 30 min
of glucose administration and reached its maximal value
(259.25 ± 4.15 mg dl−1 ) after 1 h then decreased rapidly until it reached its initial value (176.25 ± 6.88 mg dl−1 ) 3 h
after oral glucose load (fig. 6).
pretreatment of mild diabetic rats with 100 mg kg−1
 xxxd358xxx  for 2 h before the ogtt showed similar improvement of oral glucose tolerance. serum glucose increased
after 30 min of glucose administration and reached its
maximal value (245 ± 23.97 mg dl−1 ) after 1 h then decreased rapidly until it reached its initial value (157.5 ±
11.41 mg dl−1 ) 3 h after oral glucose load (fig. 6).
there was no significant difference between the effect of
the two doses of  xxxd358xxx  on serum glucose levels during
the entire period of the experiment.

 xxxd358xxx  (50 mg kg−1 ) significantly increased the hypoglycemic effect of insulin after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h insulin treatment when compared to the corresponding value
in only insulin-treated group (fig. 9).

utilization [18,19]. norepinephrine as well as epinephrine
could inhibit insulin secretion [20]. decrease in insulin
secretion and its peripheral action worsen plasma glucose
metabolism [19]. stress also enhances glucagon secretion
[18] and the infusion of glucagon elevates plasma glucose levels, primarily through hepatic glycogenolysis [21].

cortisol is also supposed to be involved in stress-induced
hyperglycemia; however, infusion of cortisol alone did not
induce a rise in plasma glucose [22].

ported to elevate plasma glucose levels in rats [23]. the alpha adrenoreceptor and cholinergic nerves may contribute to
the stress-induced hyperglycemia. it is well-established that
alpha adrenoreceptor overfunctions contribute to the hyperglycemia induced by various forms of stress [24]. recent
findings incorporate  xxxg674xxx  as a new mediator in this
stress model. blood endothelin level increases remarkably
after 1 h water immersion and continued to rise markedly
with stress time [2,3]. increase in endogenous  xxxg674xxx 
due to stress suggested the possibility that endothelin may
participate in the metabolic changes caused by water immersion stress. in the present study, the effects of endothelin
receptor antagonism using  xxxd358xxx , a mixed eta / xxxg677xxx  antagonist, on stress-induced changes in serum glucose and insulin levels as well as liver glycogen contents
were examined.
subjecting both  xxxd358xxx -treated and control groups to 1 h
rwis produced a significant rise in fasting serum glucose
levels while  xxxd358xxx -treated groups produced less hyperglycemia with glucose levels significantly lower than that of
the control group. these results could be attributed to the
elevated  xxxg674xxx  levels in this model of stress in addition to other stress hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, and glucocorticoids.
elevated endothelin level is supposed to induce hyperglycemia in normoglycemic rats. this is observed in the

work of juan et al. [7] where they demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of et-1 in conscious rats produced a
significant hyperglycemic reaction without significant effect
on concomitant plasma insulin levels.
normally, insulin-dependent glucose metabolism takes
place in three main insulin-targeting tissues; namely, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver. in a cell culture system
of human skeletal myoblasts, both endothelin and insulin
enhanced glucose uptake but their effects were not additive
[25]. the endothelin- and insulin-mediated glucose transport of skeletal muscle is mainly through the same protein
kinase c (pkc)-dependent pathway [25]. conceivably, because et-1 can compete with insulin for muscular uptake
of glucose, it actually interferes with a normal insulin activity and produces an insulin-resistant condition. in isolated
rat adipocytes, et-1 did not affect the basal but inhibited
insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner [5]. in isolated perfused rat liver [10] and cultured rat
hepatocytes [9], et-1 caused a rapid and sustained stimulation of glycogenolysis and resulted in a dose-dependent
hepatic glucose production.
all these in vitro studies demonstrated that et-1 could
antagonize insulin actions of facilitating glucose transport
or inhibiting glycogenolysis support the finding of this study
that  xxxd358xxx  partially inhibited the hyperglycemia induced
by rwis to a significant extent through blocking of et-1
receptors. the actions of other stress hormones are probably
still present and may be responsible for the degree of hyperglycemia produced by stress in  xxxd358xxx -treated groups.
when control normoglycemic rats were subjected to
rwis, a significant decline in fasting serum insulin levels
was observed. catecholamines released during stress period may be responsible for this effect. the participation
of catecholamines in the inhibition of insulin secretion
during exercise and stress was studied by leclercq-meyer
and malaisse [26] where they showed that prior injection
of  xxxd2914xxx  abolishes the exercise-induced inhibition
of insulin release. these findings support the concept that
such an inhibition is due to activation of alpha adrenergic
receptors of the beta cell by endogenously released catecholamines. in the work of bertrand et al. [27], epinephrine
caused nearly complete inhibition of glucose-stimulated
insulin release from rat pancreatic islets. they found that
yohimbine, the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist selectively
prevented the inhibition by epinephrine suggesting that
epinephrine appears to exert its effect by activating postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.
in  xxxd358xxx -treated groups, no significant change in insulin levels occurred after stress. this means that blocking
endothelin receptors completely abolished stress-induced
decrease in insulin secretion. since blocking of alpha receptors as well as endothelin receptors abolished the effect of
stress on insulin secretion, this may suggest that the action of
endothelin may be mediated by its ability to release adrenal
catecholamines secretion. this suggestion is supported by
the report of nagayama et al. [28] who investigated the

s.a. said et al. / pharmacological research 51 (2005) 107–115

role of endogenous endothelins in catecholamine secretion
in response to electrical stimulation of perfused rat adrenal
gland. they found that fr 139317, an  xxxg676xxx  antagonist, inhibited the electrical stimulation-induced epinephrine
and norepinephrine output. in 1997, yamaguchi [29] also
found that bq-123, an  xxxg676xxx  antagonist significantly inhibited et-1-induced catecholamine release in the
canine adrenal gland in vivo in a dose-dependent manner
suggesting that  xxxg676xxx  may play a predominant role
in mediating the et-1-induced catecholamine secretion.
subjecting both  xxxd358xxx -treated and control groups to
rwis produced a significant decrease in hepatic glycogen
contents, however, liver glycogen content was still significantly higher in  xxxd358xxx -treated groups as compared to the
control stressed one. these results could be explained as
mentioned above by blocking the glycogenolytic effect of
 xxxg674xxx  only while the effect of other stress hormones
was still present.
diabetes mellitus is among the major public health
problems in the world. several studies [30,31] reported
that, hypertension is more prevalent among diabetics than
non-diabetics. blood pressure reduction has been shown
to be beneficial and to reduce secondary complications of
diabetes mellitus [32]. elevated plasma endothelin levels
were reported in both hypertension [33–35] and diabetes
mellitus [4,36,37]. the elevated endothelin levels may contribute to the development of diabetic complications such
as retinopathy [38], neuropathy [39], and nephropathy [40].
because endothelin antagonists, including  xxxd358xxx , were
tested for reduction of elevated blood pressure in hypertensive patients [41] and also may be useful in reducing
the incidence of diabetic vascular complications in diabetic
hypertensive patients, the possible acute effect of  xxxd358xxx 
on serum glucose and insulin levels in mild diabetes were
necessary to be determined. when mild diabetic rats were
used in this study, results revealed that oral administration
of  xxxd358xxx  decreased fasting serum glucose level. the mild
diabetic state was produced through control of stz dosage
using a small dose 38 mg kg−1 resulting in a state that
mimics the clinical picture of type ii diabetes [15]. in type
ii diabetes, the problem is not due to a lack of insulin but
to ineffectiveness of insulin so the body is insulin-resistant
and does not respond to its own insulin [42]. elevated et-1
level in plasma have been reported in patients with insulin
resistance, such as that resulting from type ii diabetes [4].
in addition, et-1 is reported to induce insulin resistance
in rats [5–7] and humans [8]. it is generally agreed that
stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3 ( xxxg1743xxx )-kinase activity
and proper subcellular localization are absolutely required
for insulin-stimulated glucose transport.  xxxg1194xxx 
substrate 1 ( xxxg1198xxx ) and the other irs family members are
major substrates of the  xxxg1194xxx , which, when tyrosine phosphorylated, leads to stimulation of  xxxg1743xxx -kinase activity [43]. some investigators tried to find other molecular
components connecting the  xxxg1194xxx  to  xxxg1743xxx -kinase
[44]. they have provided evidence strongly arguing that the

113

g protein, g␣q/11 can be tyrosine phosphorylated by the
 xxxg1194xxx  and behaves as a molecular link connecting
the  xxxg1194xxx  to  xxxg1743xxx -kinase. single cell microinjection of g␣q/11 inhibitors blocks insulin-stimulated glucose
transporter 4 (glut4) translocation and glucose transport.
this effect is dependent on  xxxg1743xxx -kinase in 3t3-l1 adipocytes
[44]. it was found that et-1 can stimulate glut4 translocation and glucose transport and that et-1 leads to tyrosine
phosphorylation of g␣q/11 with subsequent association of
this g protein with  xxxg1743xxx -kinase, leading to transport stimulation [45]. ishibashi et al. [46] found that et-1 pretreatment
substantially inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake
and glut4 translocation and cotreatment with the  xxxg676xxx  antagonist, bq 610 prevented these effects. they also
found that chronic treatment inhibited insulin-stimulated
tyrosine phosphorylation of g␣q/11 and  xxxg1198xxx , as well as
their association with  xxxg1743xxx -kinase and blocked the activation
of  xxxg1743xxx -kinase activity. from their results, they explored the
hypothesis that chronic et-1 treatment could cause heterologous desensitization of insulin action because both insulin
and et-1 stimulate glucose transport, utilizing common
downstream signaling elements.
increased levels of protein kinase c activity have been
shown to alter the phosphorylation of the  xxxg1194xxx ,
which may also give rise to a diminished glucose transport
activity and thereby a decrease in insulin sensitivity [47]. the
anti-insulin actions of et-1 may play an important role in
inducing insulin resistance manifested as hypertriacylglycerolemia and hyperglycemia in diabetes. this supports our
finding that  xxxd358xxx  when given to mild diabetic rats in a
dose of 50 mg kg−1 produced significant decrease in serum
glucose level lasting for 4 h while in a dose of 100 mg kg−1 ,
 xxxd358xxx  significantly decreased serum glucose level for 6 h.
since  xxxd358xxx  had no direct effect on insulin secretion observed in this group of rats, its lowering effect on serum glucose levels may be due to enhancement of insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake. this was confirmed by performing an ogtt
in mild diabetic rats. this diagnostic test measures the ability to handle a glucose load over a period of time.
in the present study, when control non-diabetic rats were
subjected to this test, serum glucose level reached its peak 1 h
after oral glucose load and returned to normal values after 2 h
(normal ogtt), whereas the control diabetic rats showed an
impaired ogtt, the glucose peak level was reached 2 h after
oral glucose and declined at a slower rate (impaired ogtt).
 xxxd358xxx -treated diabetic rats showed an improved ogtt
in which glucose peak was reached after 1 h and serum glucose level returned to initial normal values after 2 h. these
results can lead us to suggest that, the improved ogtt may
be due to enhanced sensitivity to insulin by  xxxd358xxx . the
work of juan et al. [7] supports our findings. they confirmed
that et-1 causes insulin resistance by performing an ogtt.
they found that plasma glucose disposal after et-1 injection was significantly impaired, largely due to decreased insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues. the decrease in
serum glucose level by  xxxd358xxx  in mild diabetes may be

114

also due to its antagonistic effect on endothelin-stimulated
glycogenolysis.
concerning the effect on serum glucose and insulin levels
in severely diabetic rats,  xxxd358xxx  did not produce any significant change. severe diabetes induced by i.p. injection of
high dose of stz, which mimics  xxxg1193xxx  is usually associated with nearly complete destruction of pancreatic ␤-cells
[16]. our findings suggests that  xxxd358xxx  may act through
reducing insulin resistance when ineffective endogenous insulin is present but in case of insulin deficiency,  xxxd358xxx 
has no effect on serum glucose level.
therefore, it was necessary to study the combined effect
of  xxxd358xxx  and insulin in severe diabetic rats. we found
that  xxxd358xxx  enhances the hypoglycemic action of insulin
by decreasing its onset and prolonging its duration. low
dose of  xxxd358xxx  only was used in this experiment due to the
severe hypoglycemic effect caused by its combination with
insulin. these observations can be taken as another support
for our findings.
in conclusion, our results suggest that  xxxd358xxx  has a hypoglycemic effect in stress conditions. in addition, it potentiates the hypoglycemic effect of insulin. clinical studies are
needed in order to elucidate the beneficial effect of  xxxd358xxx 
in stress conditions and diabetes.
