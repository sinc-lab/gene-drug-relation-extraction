 xxxd2207xxx  (ivig) has been used for nearly three decades as an efficient antiinflammatory therapeutic regimen in a growing number of autoimmune diseases. despite this
their success in clinical application, the mechanism of action of ivig therapy remains elusive. during
the last few years, several mechanisms dependent on either the igg variable or constant fragment
have been proposed to explain the potent immunomodulatory activity of ivig. this review will
discuss which molecular and cellular pathways might be involved in the anti-inflammatory activity
of ivig and for which types of autoimmune diseases they might be relevant.

intravenous immunoglobulins (ivig) are
enriched preparations of serum igg derived from
several thousands of donors [1,2] . originally, ivig
was solely used as an igg replacement therapy
to prevent opportunistic infections in patients
with low levels of igg, such as after bone marrow transplantation or in patients with genetic
diseases affecting antibody production by b
cells [3] . depending on the production process,
an ivig preparation can contain significant levels
of other serum immuno­globulins, such as iga
or igm. the amount of these other immunoglobulins varies greatly between different ivig
preparations, ranging from trace amounts to up
to mg/ml concentrations, arguing against a major
involvement in the therapeutic activity. as will
be discussed later in greater detail, data from
animal studies and human patient cohorts performed with purified igg preparations strongly
suggest that igg is the active component in the
ivig preparation. the anti-inflammatory activity
of high-dose igg infusion was first noticed by
imbach and colleagues 29 years ago when they
treated a child with idiopathic thrombocyto­
penia purpura (itp) and noticed an improvement in platelet count [4] . later on, this result
was confirmed in adult itp cohorts and, consequently, igg now represents a highly effective
treatment option to transiently stabilize platelet
counts in itp patients [5] . besides itp, ivig is
licensed for the treatment of guillain–barré syndrome, kawasaki disease and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( xxxg1787xxx ) [1] .
currently, however, the off-label use of this

anti-inflammatory drug far exceeds the amount
used in these four licensed applications. examples
of autoimmune diseases that are treated by ivig
infusion include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
arthritis, myesthenia gravis and inflammatory
skin diseases [1] . however, it should be noted
that for the majority of off-label applications,
no controlled clinical trials have been performed
and, therefore, these results should be interpreted
with caution. equalling this multitude of applications, several different mechanisms have been
proposed to explain the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig [6] . broadly speaking, these different
mechanisms have been suggested to be either
dependent on the igg f(ab)2 (variable) or fc
(constant) fragments [1,2,7,8] . in the following
paragraphs we will discuss these mechanisms
with respect to the different autoimmune diseases
for which they might be relevant.
f(ab)2-dependent mechanisms of
ivig activity

several potentially anti-inflammatory pathways
have been associated with the f(ab)2 fragment of the igg molecule (figure 1) . the first is
dependent on the specificity of the many different igg species present in an ivig preparation, representing the (auto)immune status of
the individual blood donors. thus, a variety of
autoreactive igg species have been detected in
the ivig preparation, which might be involved
in the anti-inflammatory activity. among others,
specific antibodies for fas, cd5, the t-cell receptor, autoantibodies (anti-idiotype), and various

these effector cells from the circulation [11,12] . as ivig injection
does not result in a severe neutropenia in vivo, these siglec-specific
antibodies do not seem to affect the total neutrophil or eosinophil
populations but might rather act on subpopulations of these cells.
apart from affecting effector cells, there are several studies
suggesting that ivig modulates b-cell responses via the removal
of essential b-cell survival factors. thus,  xxxg2305xxx 
belonging to the tnf family (baff)- and a proliferation-inducing
ligand (april)-specific igg species were detected in the ivig
preparation, and culturing b cells in the presence of ivig resulted
in a reduction of b-cell proliferation [13,14] . moreover, cytokine-specific antibodies or igg in the ivig preparation might impact dendritic cell (dc)-mediated maturation and the expansion of tregs.
thus, ivig was shown to increase treg activity or expand this treg
population in vitro and in vivo, which was involved in controlling
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) [15,16] . it has been shown the iggblocking cellular

molecules of dcs could specifically expand
tregs [17] , and this has been proposed as a
potential mechanism by which ivig might
activate tregs. supporting this, dc maturation and differentiation were shown to be
impaired in the presence of ivig in vitro [18] .
in human dc cultures, it was demonstrated
that this effect was due to neutralization of
ifn-a by ifn-a-specific antibodies in the

enhanced dc maturation, resulting in the
activation of nk cells and the killing of
dcs by this activated natural killer (nk)

besides these antigen-specific effects,
another f(ab)2-dependent mechanism
independent of a certain antigen specificity has been proposed. it is based on the

mechanisms of action of intravenous immunoglobulins

conclusions can be drawn. very recently it was noted that ivig
infusion results in upregulation of the inhibitory fc receptor iib
(fcgriib or  xxxg773xxx ) on mouse and human b cells (figure 2) [27,28] .
on mouse b cells, it was proposed that this upregulation might be
mediated by the f(ab)2 fragment [28] ; whether this also holds true
for human b cells remains to be established. this is in contrast
to the many reports showing that the fcgriib-dependent antiinflammatory activity of ivig is mediated through the fc fragment [29–32] . one explanation for these differing results might
be that, depending on the cell type, either the fc or the f(ab)2
fragment might modulate receptor expression. clearly, more indepth studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanism of
ivig-mediated regulation of fcgriib expression on b cells.
regardless of whether upregulation of fcgriib on b cells is
f(ab)2- or fc-dependent, it is likely to have some significant consequences for b-cell homeostasis and long-term effects on autoantibody production by plasma cells. on b cells, fcgriib regulates positive signals initiated via the b-cell receptor (bcr) [33] .

review

while the crosslinking of fcgriib together with the bcr is
anti-apoptotic, isolated triggering of fcgriib can induce b-cell
apoptosis [34,35] . this function was recently suggested to be an
important mechanism of regulating plasma cell homeostasis in the
bone marrow [36] . in contrast to naive b cells, plasma cells virtually
lack bcr expression but are positive for fcgriib. thus, ivigmediated upregulation of fcgriib might sensitize autoantibodyproducing plasma cells or memory b cells for the induction of
apoptosis. interestingly, many autoimmune-prone mouse strains
and patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and  xxxg1787xxx  have decreased fcgriib expression
[27,37] . this might render their b cells and autoantibody-producing plasma cells less sensitive to apoptosis induction via immune
complexes, as demonstrated in mouse plasma cells derived from
autoimmune-prone mouse strains [36] . restoring this threshold
to normal levels via ivig therapy or gene therapy (in mice) was
demonstrated to interfere with auto­immune disease pathology and
the production of autoantibodies by b cells [38–40] .

and the downmodulation of activating fcgrs on myeloid effector cells infiltrating the inflamed tissue and increases their activation
threshold. more recently, ivig-mediated upregulation of fcgriib on mouse and human b cells has been observed. see text for

fc-dependent mechanisms of ivig activity

the igg fc fragment is well known for linking the specificity
of the adaptive immune system (antibodies) to the potent pro­
inflammatory effects mediated by innate immune effector cells,
including neutrophils, mast cells and macrophages [41,42] . thus,
at first sight, it seems hard to comprehend that this portion of the
antibody might also be responsible for anti-inflammatory activity.
however, clinical trials with human itp patient cohorts have
demonstrated that the isolated igg fc fragment has the capacity
to suppress autoantibody-mediated platelet depletion very efficiently [43] . a similar observation was made in mouse models of
itp, rheumatoid arthritis and nephrotoxic nephritis, supporting
the general importance of this fc-dependent anti-inflammatory
effect and arguing against a f(ab)2-dependent mechanism, at
least in these in vivo model systems of igg-mediated inflammation [30–32] . to discuss these different activities of the igg
fc fragment, it is necessary to first provide an overview of the
pathways involved in the proinflammatory activity of igg and
then evaluate how the therapeutic application of high doses of
igg might interfere with this function.
fc-dependent proinflammatory responses

the igg fc fragment consists of three different domains (ch1–3)
and a hinge region that can interact with a multitude of self and
nonself interaction partners. with respect to igg-mediated
inflammation, three different players need to be introduced: the
neonatal fc receptor (fcrn), the first component of the complement pathway, c1q, and the family of classical fcg receptors
(fcgrs) [23,42,44] . while fcrn is crucial for determining igg halflife and, thus, only indirectly affects the proinflammatory activity
of igg, the latter two directly trigger inflammation by activating either the complement pathway or innate immune effector
cells [23,42] . mice and humans have four different igg subclasses
(igg1–4 in humans; igg1, igg2a, igg2b and igg3 in mice),
which vary in their serum concentration and capacity to interact
with cellular fcgrs or to activate the complement pathway [45] .
thus, mouse igg2a and igg2b and human igg1 and igg3 are
potent in triggering both pathways, whereas mouse igg1 and
human igg2 mainly interact with fcgrs [46] . summarizing the
work carried out by many groups, it is now generally accepted
that the proinflammatory activity of igg is predominantly dependent on cellular fcgrs in vivo [41,47–49] . in mouse strains lacking
fcgrs, antibody­-mediated effector functions, including antibody­dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc), phagocytosis of immune
complexes and the release of proinflammatory cytokines were dramatically reduced or fully absent. despite the absence of inflammation, activated complement proteins, such as  xxxg282xxx , were still
present in tissues [30,50] . consistent with these results, inactivation
of the complement pathway had no major effect on these late antibody functions [51] . as mentioned previously, there are instances
where inactivation of late complement components (especially
 xxxg285xxx ) independently of the known complement activation pathways resulted in a block of antibody-mediated inflammation [26] .
whether the afore­mentioned capacity of the ivig f(ab)2 fragment to scavenge  xxxg285xxx  might be relevant for the anti-inflammatory
428

activity or whether the fc fragment is mediating suppression of
inflammation in these instances remains to be established. of
note, the generation of activated  xxxg285xxx  in these model systems
seemed to be dependent on igg-mediated crosslinking of classical fcgrs, reminding us of the general importance of this family
of proteins in mediating proinflammatory responses.
the family of fcgrs consists of activating and inhibitory members, which are coexpressed on the majority of innate immune
effector cells in humans and mice, thereby setting a threshold for
cell activation [38] . whereas the majority of these receptors are of
low affinity and can only recognize igg in the form of immune
complexes, there is one high-affinity receptor, fcgri ( xxxg770xxx ),
which can interact with monomeric igg. although significant
sequence homology exists between human and mouse fcgrs,
they clearly differ with respect to their specificity and affinity
for the different mouse and  xxxd2207xxx  subclasses, making the
direct transfer of data obtained for specific fcgrs and individual
igg subclasses from mice to humans difficult [45] . nonetheless,
results obtained in both mice and humans clearly point towards
the general importance of the low-affinity activating fcgrs
(fcgriia and fcgriiia in humans and  xxxg775xxx  and fcgriv
in mice) for igg-mediated triggering of inflammation, adcc
and phagocytosis [50,52–60] . thus, using blocking antibodies for
human fcgriiia in human itp patients and in mice transgenic
for this  xxxg772xxx  efficiently suppressed platelet depletion [32,49] . in
classical mouse models, blocking antibodies specific for the two
low-affinity receptors  xxxg775xxx  and fcgriv or their genetic deletion efficiently interfered with autoantibody-induced pathology
in a wide variety of autoimmune diseases including itp, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, nephrotoxic nephritis and rheumatoid
arthritis. similar results were obtained in models of antitumor
therapy with monoclonal antibodies [56,57,59–64] . the inhibitory
fcgriib has been reported to be important for the maintenance
of humoral tolerance and the modulation of activation of innate
immune effector cells in both mice and humans [27,37,41,42,65] . with
respect to the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig, it is noteworthy
that the human therapeutic product works at the same clinically
relevant concentration in mice, suggesting that the mouse in vivo
model systems are valuable tools for studying the mechanism of
the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig.
mechanism of ivig activity: direct interference versus
indirect pathways of immunomodulation

there are two models that propose mechanisms by which the
ivig fc fragment might be able to suppress the proinflammatory
activity of igg autoantibodies. the first model suggests that ivig
directly competes with autoantibodies for binding of interaction
partners essential for igg half-life and the initiation of proinflammatory effector pathways (fcrn and activating fcgrs) (figure 1) .
the second model hypothesizes that certain igg glycosylation
variants in the ivig preparation have an immunomodulatory
function and set a threshold for innate effector cell activation
(figure 2) [6] . in the following paragraphs, we will discuss the evidence and arguments for and against these pathways with respect
to different autoimmune diseases.

direct interference with fc fragment-recruited
effector pathways

as indicated before, igg-mediated inflammation is critically
dependent on two players: the neonatal fcr, which ensures the
long serum half-life of igg, and activating fcgrs, which recruit
and activate innate immune effector cells [44] . blocking the igg–
fcrn interaction lowers igg half-life and thereby interferes with
inflammation. thus, once high amounts of ivig are injected, they
might compete with autoantibodies for fcrn binding and lower
their serum half-life. indeed, studies in mice and rats indicated
that ivig infusion results in a significant reduction of the half-life
of a platelet-specific autoantibody [66–68] . the problem is that in
models of mouse, rat and human itp, the autoantibody-mediated
reduction in platelet counts occurs very quickly (within 1–4 h),
challenging the proposal that the reduction in serum half-life
from approximately 4 to 2.5 days has any effect on auto­antibody
activity [66] . further evidence supporting a role of fcrn in ivig
activity comes from mice with a deletion of this receptor. using
these animals in models of serum transfer arthritis and autoantibody-induced skin-blistering disease, it was shown that ivig
activity was abrogated in the absence of fcrn [69,70] . while these
results are compelling, it is difficult to compare them with the
data obtained in mouse strains that have sufficient fcrn as, in
these animals, ivig and autoantibody half-life are dramatically
reduced, requiring the injection of much more autoantibody and
ivig to achieve any effect. evidence for a limited role of fcrn
in the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig comes from studies
using aglycosylated ivig. igg molecules contain a sugar moiety
attached to the asparagine 297 residue in the ch2 domains of
each antibody heavy chain [71] . removal of this sugar moiety
interferes with the ability of igg to bind to classical fcgrs and
c1q [72] . by contrast, fcrn interacts with a distal site on igg
and is not dependent on this sugar moiety. thus, the presence or
absence of this sugar side chain should not interfere with ivig
activity if it were dependent on the neonatal fcr. contrary to this
expectation, ivig activity was actually dramatically reduced in
the absence of the sugar side chain in a model of serum transfer
arthritis, arguing against a role of fcrn at least in this model
system [31] . as deglycosylated igg changes its structure, it cannot be excluded that some of the aforementioned autoantibody
species within the ivig preparation might have an altered affinity
for their target antigen, which could impact their activity in the
f(ab)2-dependent models discussed previously.
the other hypothesis of how ivig might suppress inflammation
suggests that ivig might interfere with the binding of immune
complexes to activating fcgrs (figure 1) . given the importance of
activating fcgrs in mediating the proinflammatory activity of
autoantibodies, this explanation seems very plausible. one issue
with this theory arises when we take into consideration the very
low affinities of monomeric igg in the ivig preparation for the
low-affinity fcgrs compared with autoantibodies in the form of
immune complexes, which have a much higher avidity [45,73] . by
contrast, other immune complexes can compete with autoantibody-induced pathology very effectively. this is demonstrated by
the use of anti-d antibodies infused in small amounts to rhesus
www.expert-reviews.com

review

factor d-positive individuals, which can block autoantibodyinduced platelet depletion [74] . along these lines, it was shown
that aged ivig preparations containing increased amounts of
igg dimers or dimeric monoclonal igg preparations can also
interfere with autoantibody activity in vivo [75–77] . the amount
of igg dimers in regular ivig preparations is very heterogeneous
and ranges from 1 to 12%, depending on the manufacturer and
individual batch [78,79] . should dimeric iggs indeed be the active
component, one would expect to see dramatic differences in the
activity of these different ivig preparations, but this has not been
reported so far. besides ivig, it was also suggested that the activity of anti-d might also depend on the level of igg dimers in the
anti-d preparation, although recent studies do not support this
hypothesis [78] . moreover, the therapeutic efficacy of the isolated
monomeric fc fragments also argues against a role for dimeric
igg complexes. thus, we cannot completely exclude a role for
igg dimers in the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig at present,
although several lines of evidence do argue against it. more studies
are required to answer this question conclusively.
indirect pathways of immunomodulation

over recent years, several indirect pathways of ivig-mediated
immunomodulation have been identified, involving distinct cell
populations such as monocytes, macrophages and dcs. moreover,
different cell surface receptors, including activating and inhibitory fcg receptors and, more recently, specific  xxxg1128xxx  grabbing
nonintegrin related 1 (signr1), were suggested to be involved in
these pathways, creating a complex scenario that will be discussed
in the following paragraphs (figure 2) .
 xxxg775xxx  on dcs

in an elegant series of experiments using isolated splenocytes
incubated ex vivo with ivig and retransferred into naive animals,
lazarus and colleagues were able to mimic the anti-inflammatory
activity of ivig in a model of itp [80] . however, if splenocytes
from  xxxg775xxx -deficient animals were used in this experimental
setting, the anti-inflammatory activity was lost, and it seemed that
dcs in particular might be crucial for ivig-mediated immunosuppression [81] . contrasting with these results, it was shown that
the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig was fully intact in fcgriiideficient animals in a model of autoantibody-induced accelerated
nephrotoxic nephritis. here, ivig appeared to modulate activating
and inhibitory  xxxg772xxx  expression. a possible explanation for these
inconsistent results could be the different models of autoimmune
disease. use of the cell-transfer model in nephrotoxic nephritis
or  xxxg775xxx -deficient animals in a model of itp should provide
insight into the role of  xxxg775xxx  in both model systems. in general,
any cell-transfer model using single-cell preparations of otherwise
intact organs has to be interpreted with some caution as they no
longer reflect the 3d architecture of the organ.

longer protected from autoimmune disease in models of itp,
nephro­toxic nephritis and serum transfer arthritis [29–32,82] . a
detailed analysis of innate immune effector cells infiltrating
the inflamed organs showed that upon ivig injection, either
enhanced levels of fcgriib-positive macrophages or enhanced
expression of the inhibitory  xxxg772xxx  could be observed in models
of itp, rheumatoid arthritis and nephrotoxic nephritis [29,30,32] .
in addition, a reduced expression of the triggering activating
fcgriv was documented in the nephrotoxic nephritis model,
suggesting that this strongly increased the threshold for innate
immune effector cell activation could be the explanation for
ivig activity (figure 2) [30] . one important unresolved question is
how ivig treatment achieves this increased threshold and which
pathways and molecules are involved. as discussed previously,
cytokines can dramatically alter the expression of activating and
inhibitory fcgrs [47] . however, recent experiments performed
in a variety of mouse strains deficient in different cytokines
could not identify a significant impact of these molecules [83] .
naturally, there are many more cytokines to test and this initial
study was not exhaustive.
sialic acid & signr1 on macrophages

irrespective of cytokine involvement, one general question
is whether ivig acts directly on the effector cell population
responsible for tissue destruction, or whether the modulation of
activation thresholds requires other cells. evidence for the latter
comes from studies performed with a serum transfer arthritis model in osteo­petrotic mice (op/op mice), lacking colonystimulating factor 1-dependent monocyte and macrophage
populations. while ivig efficiently suppressed development of
arthritis in wild-type animals, op/op mice were resistant to the
anti-inflammatory action of this treatment [29] . among other cell
populations, these animals lack signr1-positive marginal-zone
macrophages, suggesting that this cell type might be involved in
mediating ivig activity. consistent with this notion, splenectomized animals behaved similarly and were no longer protected
against the induction of arthritis by ivig therapy [84] . using a
panel of blocking antibodies or knockout mouse strains, it was
demonstrated that signr1 is indeed crucially involved in the
anti-inflammatory activity and that it binds to sialic acid-rich
igg glycovariants in the ivig preparation. these data fit well
with previous studies, which demonstrated that ivig activity
can be potentiated if the polyclonal ivig preparation is enriched
for the fraction of igg molecules rich in terminal sialic acid residues on the antibody fc fragment in a model of serum transfer
arthritis [31] . by contrast, depletion of terminal sialic acid residues resulted in a loss of anti-inflammatory activity. moreover,
2,6-linked sialic acid residues, which is the predominant linkage
of this sugar residue on antibodies, were particularly important
for the anti-inflammatory activity [85] . in serum, approximately
1–5% of the igg molecules contain one or two terminal sialic
acid residues in the sugar moiety of the fc fragment [86] . of note,
it was observed more than 25 years ago that autoimmune-prone
mouse strains and patients with arthritis show a skewed serum
igg glycosylation pattern, specifically lacking igg glycovariants
430

containing terminal sialic acid and galactose residues [71,87,88] .
although it was initially thought that the lack of galactose might
enhance the proinflammatory activity of igg via recruitment
of the  xxxg1382xxx  (mbl) pathway of complement
activation, later studies performed with mbl-knockout animals
could not confirm these earlier results obtained in vitro [89,90] .
thus, it seems that sialic acid-rich igg has an active antiinflammatory activity, keeping the immune system in a resting
state. loss of this igg fraction results in immune activation and
enhanced binding of igg to cellular fcgrs. infusion of sialic
acid-rich ivig might restore the balance by actively engaging
the anti-inflammatory pathway via signr1 expression on splenic
macrophage populations.
expert commentary

overall, we are only just beginning to fully understand which
different molecular and cellular pathways are involved in the antiinflammatory activity of ivig in different types of autoimmune
diseases. considering the wide array of autoimmune diseases that
can be successfully treated with ivig, it is very likely that there
will be more than one mechanism involved in the anti-inflammatory activity. we have reached a different level of understanding
of the various anti-inflammatory pathways triggered by ivig in
individual autoimmune diseases. results obtained from in vivo
studies in mice and humans have highlighted the role of the igg
fc fragment and its specific glycosylation pattern in modulating
the pro- and anti-inflammatory activity of igg in itp, rheumatoid arthritis and nephrotoxic nephritis. in these models, sialic
acid-rich igg glycovariants and splenic macrophage populations
were shown to be crucial for the suppression of auto­immune
pathology in rheumatoid arthritis. importantly, in human itp
patients, ivig is still active in individuals who have undergone
splenectomy, suggesting that different cell populations might be
involved in ivig activity or that the pathway of ivig-mediated
suppression of platelet depletion is different from the suppression
of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. alternatively, different
cell types might be involved in the anti-inflammatory pathway
in mice and humans. the human orthologue to mouse signr1,
for example, dc-sign, is also expressed on dcs and has previously been proposed to be important for ivig activity [81] . these
findings emphasize that results obtained in mouse studies might
not be directly transferable to the human system. nonetheless,
several of the mechanisms found to be important for ivig activity
in humans also were essential in mice and vice versa. in addition to the fc-dependent mechanisms of ivig activity, several
f(ab)2-dependent mechanisms have been proposed and might
also be involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig in, for
example, the amelioration of eae. many other f(ab)2-dependent
mechanisms require further analysis in suitable in vivo model
systems to better evaluate their relevance. whereas in vitro assays
are helpful for an initial evaluation of ivig activities, studies over
the last few years have shown contradicting results, such as stimulating and blocking antibodies for the same target in the ivig
preparation, making it hard to draw definitive conclusions. in the
end, only successful clinical trials will show if the mechanisms

five-year view

in the next 5 years, more studies carefully evaluating the cell
populations and molecular pathways involved in each type of
auto­immune disease where ivig has proven anti-inflammatory
activity will be necessary to obtain a more complete picture of the
importance of the different mechanisms proposed so far. besides
the well-established modulation of monocyte/macrophage activity, it will be of great interest to further delineate the role of dcs
in the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig. to date, fc-dependent
as well as f(ab)2-dependent pathways have been implicated in
the modulation of dc activity [18,81] . one exciting impact of
the inhibition of dc maturation by ivig is that immature dcs
are actively involved in maintaining peripheral tolerance by the
induction of tregs. indeed, it was recently demonstrated that
ivig treatment induces the expansion of tregs in a model of
eae [15] . in addition, the first clinical studies with ivig glycosy­
lation variants rich in terminal sialic acid residues will soon be
performed and should show whether this modified version of

review

ivig also has enhanced anti-inflammatory activity in humans.
if so, this would be an exciting opportunity to develop recombinant versions of ivig for at least some autoimmune diseases.
a recombinant ivig preparation would also help to reduce side
effects, limit the risk of contamination with pathogenic microorganisms and help to prevent the danger of shortages in supply
in the future.

key issues
•  xxxd2207xxx  (ivig) affects several cell populations of the innate and adaptive immune system, including monocytes/
macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, b cells and tregs.
• several f(ab)2- and fc-dependent mechanisms of ivig-mediated direct interference with autoantibody-mediated effector functions
have been proposed.
• cytokine-specific (auto)antibodies within the ivig preparation might modulate immune responses, dendritic cell maturation and
regulatory t-cell function.
• evidence from mouse and human in vivo studies suggests that the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig is dependent on the ivig fc
fragment in idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, rheumatoid arthritis and nephrotoxic nephritis.
• the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig has been shown to increase the threshold for innate immune effector cell and b-cell activation
in vivo.
• sialic acid-rich igg glycosylation variants in the ivig preparation are crucial for the anti-inflammatory activity of ivig in models of
nephrotoxic nephritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
• a novel signr1-dependent pathway is involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of sialic acid-rich glycosylation variants in ivig
preparations in mice.
