human endothelial cells

abstract:  xxxg36xxx  (ace) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. we examined the effect of carvedilol, a cardiovascular drug, on basal and
stimulated ace production in human endothelial cells. carvedilol
(0.625–5 µm), in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited basal
and  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf, 0.5 nm) or phorbol
12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma, 10 nm) induced ace up-regulation.
carvedilol has non-selective ␤-adrenoceptor and selective ␣1adrenoceptor blocking activity, calcium channel blocking, and antioxidant activity. to study whether these activities were related to
ace down-regulation, endothelial cells were treated with metoprolol
(1–10 µm), propranolol (1–10 µm),  xxxd3000xxx  (1–5 µm),  xxxd2718xxx 
(1–10 µm),  xxxd3014xxx  (1–100 µm), or  xxxd228xxx  (1–100 µm). none
of these compounds modified ace. vegf (0.5 nm) and pma (10
nm) induced pkc phosphorylation, which was inhibited by cotreatment of cell cultures with carvedilol (5 µm). in conclusion,
carvedilol inhibited basal and vegf or pma induced ace upregulation. inhibition of pkc phosphorylation was probably involved
in carvedilol action.

arvedilol, a vasodilating agent with multiple pharmacological properties, was originally designed as an agent for
the management of hypertension and coronary artery disease.
more recently, carvedilol has been shown to be effective in the
management of congestive heart failure.1 carvedilol exhibits
cardioprotective properties and prevents cardiac remodeling in
congestive heart failure and following myocardial infarction.2
in spontaneously hypertensive rats carvedilol reduces vascular
and ventricular hypertrophy.3 the mechanisms of the extraordinary cardiac protection by carvedilol is not clear but it may

be explained by the multiple actions of this compound. carvedilol is a nonselective ␤-adrenoceptor-blocking agent and a
selective ␣1-adrenoceptor blocker. it also has antioxidant and
free radical scavenger properties. at higher concentrations,
carvedilol is a calcium channel antagonist.4
in vitro studies show that carvedilol is an inhibitor of
vascular smooth muscle proliferation induced by various mitogens such as et-1, fgf, pdgf, and thrombin.5 carvedilol
prevents ldl-enhanced monocyte adhesion to endothelial
cells by inhibiting ldl oxidation.6 in human endothelial cells
carvedilol inhibits  xxxg674xxx  production.7,8
renin-angiotensin system, through its effector peptide,
 xxxg99xxx , plays a significant role in the pathophysiology
of hypertension but also in the process of atherosclerosis and in
cardiovascular pathology including left ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling and repair processes of the myocardium
following myocardial infarction.9
angiotensin converting enzyme (ace), which is widely
distributed on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium, is a
key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems by generating  xxxg99xxx  and degrading bradykinin.10
as a regulator of aii production ace has an important role in
cardiovascular pathologies. ace inhibitors are effective both
in reducing experimental atherogenesis11 and in the reduction
of left ventricular hypertrophy of hypertensive patients.12
in the present study we show that carvedilol inhibits
basal and stimulated ace production in human endothelial
cells.

endothelial cells were prepared from human umbilical
cord veins according to jaffe et al.13 veins were cannulated,
washed with phosphate buffered saline (pbs), and treated with
0.5% collagenase (sigma, st. louis, mo) in pbs for 15 minutes at room temperature and cells were then collected by centrifugation. cells were grown to confluence in 0.2% gelatin
(sigma) coated cell culture flasks (costar, cambridge, ma) in
medium 199 (gibco laboratories inc., belmont, ca) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (gibco), 20 µg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (sigma), 12 u/ml heparin (sigma),
100 u/ml g-penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (gibco), and 2

mm l-glutamine (gibco) at 37°c in humidified 5% carbon dioxide in air. the cells were detached with 0.125% trypsin0.02% na2edta solution (gibco) and subcultured on 48-well
cell culture plates (costar) coated with 0.2% gelatin solution.
the cells were identified as endothelial cells by their typical
cobblestone appearance and the presence of von willebrand
factor demonstrated by an immunofluorescence method using rabbit immunoglobulin to human  xxxg2423xxx 
(dakopatts, glostrup, denmark). more than 90% of the cells
stained positively.

and then vegf (0.5 nm) or pma (10 nm) was added and
incubation was continued for a further 24 hours.

experimental design
confluent subcultures at passages 1 to 2 were incubated
in medium 199 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. the
effect of carvedilol (0.625–5 µm), propranolol (1–10 µm),
metoprolol (1–10 µm),  xxxd3000xxx  (1–5 µm),  xxxd2718xxx  (1–10
µm),  xxxd228xxx  (1–100 µm), or  xxxd3014xxx  (1–100 µm) on
basal ace production was studied. to stimulate ace production, cell cultures were incubated with vegf (0.5 nm) or pma
(10 nm) for 24 hours. cell cultures were preincubated with
carvedilol or the following cardiovascular agents:  xxxd2718xxx ,
 xxxd3014xxx , or  xxxd228xxx  for 3 hours before vegf or pma
was added and then incubated for further 24 hours. carvedilol
was from f. hoffmann la roche (basel, switzerland); other
agents were from sigma. after incubation, an ace assay was
performed as described below.

angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
binding assay
angiotensin converting enzyme amount in intact endothelial cells was measured by an inhibitor binding assay (iba)
developed and characterized in our laboratory.14,15 briefly, a
lisinopril analog, p-hydroxybenzamidine derivative of n-(1carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-l-lysyl- xxxd2434xxx  = 351a (merck,
sharp and dohme, rahway, nj), was labeled with 125-iodine
(ims 30, amersham, bucks, england) using chloramine t
method, as described elsewhere.14 125i-351a is specifically
bound to ace.14,16 after incubation of huvec’s with test
substances cell monolayers were washed with pbs. typically,
20,000 cpm of label per well in culture medium was added to
huvec’s cultured on 48-well plates. following incubation at
37°c for 2 hours, cells were washed twice with pbs, then detached with 0.1 m naoh, and counted in a gamma counter.
the amount of ace is given as inhibitor (125i-351a) bound
cpm/105 cells, which is proportional to the amount of ace on
the cell membrane.14 the method was previously shown to
closely match the enzyme activity method.14,17

total rna and cdna preparation
total rna from huvecs was isolated using
genelute™ mammalian total rna kit (sigma) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. after dnase i treatment
(sigma) rna concentrations were measured using the ribogreen fluorescent nucleic acid stain (rna quantification kit,
molecular probes, eugene, or) and checked by agarose gel
electrophoresis. a half µg of total rna was transcribed into
cdna using m-mlv reverse transcriptase (life technologies, paisley, uk) and oligo (dt)12-18 (500 µg/µl) primer.

quantification of angiotensin converting
enzyme mrna and ␤-actin mrna
quantification of the mrnas was performed by realtime pcr using lightcycler technology (roche diagnostics
gmbh, mannheim, germany). two µl of 1:10 diluted cdna
was brought to a final volume of 20 µl, containing 4 mm
mgcl2 (3 mm for ␤-actin), 2 µl of lightcycler-faststart
dna sybr green i mix (roche diagnostics), and 0.5 µm of
primers in h2o. after initial activation of the dna polymerase
at 95°c for 10 minutes, the amplification conditions were as
follows: 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°c for 15
seconds, annealing for 3 seconds at 56°c (ace), 3 seconds at
57°c (␤-actin), and extension at 72°c. the extension times
(sec) were calculated from the amplicon size (base pairs/25).
fluorescent data were acquired at the end of each extension
phase. quantification was done by using the second derivative
maximum method of the lightcycler software (roche molecular biochemicals), which determines the crossing points of
individual samples by an algorithm identifying the first turning
point of the fluorescence curve. after amplification, a melting
curve analysis from 65°c to 95°c with heating rate of 0.1°c /s
with continuous fluorescence acquisition was made.
the used primers for ␤-actin (accession m10277) were:
forward 5⬘-cac act  xxxg889xxx  ccc atc tac ga and reverse
primer 5⬘-cca tct ctt gct cga agt cc, amplicon size
202 bp, and for ace (accession af118569): forward 5⬘-acc
aat gac acg gaa ag and reverse 5⬘- xxxg889xxx  ggt ttc
gtt tcg g (amplicon size 207 bp). standard curves were
created from specific pcr products. the signals of the
samples of interest were then quantified from the standard
curve and the expression of ace determined relative to ␤actin.

immunoblotting of phosphorylated pkc
confluent endothelial cells in  xxxd1728xxx  0.5% fcs were preincubated with carvedilol (5 µm) for 3 hours. then vegf (0.5
nm) or pma (10 nm) was added and incubation was continued
for 15 minutes. both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated
pkc levels were measured using phospho-pkc (pan) anti-

body (cell signaling technology, bevery, ma) and pkc
(mc5) antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, inc., ca). western blot analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (cell signaling technology). briefly, cells
were rinsed with ice-cold pbs and lysed with sds sample
buffer containing 62.5 mm tris-hcl (ph 6.8), 2% sds, 10%
glycerol, 50 mm dtt, and 0.1% bromophenol blue and immediately scraped off the plate and sonicated. an aliquot of
sample was boiled for 5 minutes, centrifuged, and applied to
sds-page gel for western blotting. equal amounts of protein
in the supernatants were subjected to sds-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. a 10% sds-page bis-acrylamide gel was
run at 100 v for 1.5 hours. after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were blotted overnight with phosphopkc (pan) antibody, or pkc (mc5) antibody, 1:1000 and then
the membranes were incubated with hrp-conjugated secondary antibody 1:2000 (cell signaling technology) for 1 hour.
the bands were then visualized with western blot chemiluminescence reagent plus (nentm life science products, inc.,
boston, ma) following autoradiography according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

results
effects of carvedilol on membrane-bound
angiotensin converting enzyme
carvedilol in a concentration-dependent manner
(1.25–5 µm) suppressed membrane bound ace amount measured after 24 hours treatment (fig. 1). ace production was
induced by treatment of the cell cultures with vegf (0.5 nm)
or pma (10 nm). treatment of endothelial cells with carvedilol (0.625–5 µm) in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited vegf (0.5 nm) or pma (10 nm) induced ace upregulation (fig. 2a,b).

effects of carvedilol on angiotensin
converting enzyme mrna levels
to study whether the suppressive effect of carvedilol on
vegf or pma induced ace up-regulation was also found at
mrna level, real-time pcr was used to quantify the levels of
ace mrna and ␤-actin mrna. single and sharply defined
melting curves with narrow peaks were obtained for both pcr
products. once the predicted lengths of the pcr products were
confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, the tm was used to
identify specific products in subsequent analysis. levels of the
␤-actin mrna did not vary significantly between treatments

effects of other cardiovascular drugs on
membrane-bound angiotensin

endothelial cells were treated with the ␤1-blocker, metoprolol (1–10 µm), the non-selective ␤-blocker, propranolol
(1–10 µm), the ␣1-blocker,  xxxd3000xxx  (1–5 µm), the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel blocker,  xxxd2718xxx  (1–10
µm) or the antioxidant compounds,  xxxd3014xxx  (1–100 µm) or
 xxxd228xxx  (1–100 µm). none of these compounds inhibited
basal ace production (table 1). among these compounds the
effect of  xxxd2718xxx ,  xxxd3014xxx , or  xxxd228xxx  on vegfstimulated ace production was studied. these compounds
did not modulate vegf-stimulated ace production (data not
shown).

effects of carvedilol on pkc phosphorylation
treatment of huvec’s with pma (10 nm) or vegf
(0.5 nm) induced pkc phosphorylation measured after 15
minutes stimulation, which was inhibited by preincubation of
the cells for 3 hours with carvedilol (5 µm). non-phosphorylated pkc levels were not significantly modulated by treatments (fig. 4 a,b).

confluent endothelial cells were incubated with the above agents for 24 h.
ace amount was measured using iba method. each value is the mean ± s.d.
of 8 replicate determinations from 3 to 4 separate experiments.

carvedilol is a competitive ␤-adrenoceptor and an ␣1adrenoceptor blocker. the vasodilating activity of carvedilol
has been attributed to ␣1-adrenoceptor antagonism.4 relation
of ␣1- or ␤-adrenoceptor blocking activity of carvedilol to
ace inhibition was, however, unlikely, as  xxxd3000xxx , an ␣1blocker, or the ␤-blockers, metoprolol or propranolol, did not
modify ace amount.
carvedilol, at concentrations above 1 µm, acts as a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel antagonist.4 we
studied the effect of the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium
channel blocker,  xxxd2718xxx , on basal- or vegf-stimulated
ace production.  xxxd2718xxx  at concentrations 1 to 5 µm did
not modulate basal- or vegf-induced ace up-regulation suggesting that mechanisms other than calcium channel blockade
may be involved in ace inhibition by carvedilol.
carvedilol has been shown to decrease oxidative stress
elevated in the myocardium of patients with heart failure and
thus improve cardiac function.19 its antioxidant activity may
contribute to its superior cardioprotective efficacy relative to
typical ␤-blockers.20 carvedilol has been shown to inhibit
ldl oxidation and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells,
which may protect blood vessels from atherosclerotic pro-

figure 4. effects of carvedilol on vegf- (a) or pma- (b) induced pkc phosphorylation in huvec’s. confluent cell cultures were treated with vegf (0.5 nm) or pma (10 nm) for 15
minutes in the absence or presence of carvedilol (5 µm).
carvedilol was added 3 hours prior to vegf or pma. cell extracts were prepared and subjected to sds-page and immunoblotted with phospho-pkc-antibody and pkc-antibody.

cesses.21 to elucidate whether the antioxidant property of
carvedilol was related to ace inhibition we studied the effect
of antioxidative compounds,  xxxd3014xxx  and  xxxd228xxx , on
basal- and vegf-induced ace up-regulation. these compounds, even at a high concentration (100 µm), did not modify
ace suggesting that antioxidant and free radical scavenging
activities of carvedilol may not be involved in ace inhibition
in our cell culture system.
none of the known mechanism of carvedilol action—the
␣1- or ␤-adrenergic antagonism, the calcium channel blockade, or the antioxidant activity—seem to explain the suppressive effect of carvedilol on ace.
to further study the mechanism by which carvedilol inhibits ace production we focused on the intracellular signaling molecule pkc, which is involved in ace regulation.22,23
pma, a direct pkc activator, is a potent ace stimulator. on
the other hand, we have previously reported that pkc is a mediator involved in vegf-induced ace production.23 inhibition of pkc by the selective pkc inhibitor,  xxxd2195xxx , or

carvedilol inhibits ace production

down-regulation of pkc totally blocked vegf-induced ace
up-regulation.23 therefore, we studied whether vegf- or
pma-induced pkc phosphorylation was modulated by carvedilol. we show that pma and vegf induced pkc phosphorylation, which was inhibited by carvedilol. these data suggest
that carvedilol may inhibit vegf- or pma- induced ace production through inhibition of pkc phosphorylation.
renin-angiotensin system has an important role in the
development and risk of hypertensive heart disease and its major complication, congestive heart failure.24 ace is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system by producing  xxxg99xxx , the effective peptide of this system, which mediates
vasoconstriction and cardiac and vessel hypertrophy. in addition ace inactivates the vasodilator peptides, bradykinin and
kallidin. ace inhibition is central to treatment of cardiovascular disorders. ace inhibitors have been found to improve
the prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure and after
myocardial infarction.25 ace inhibitors are effective both in
reducing experimental atherogenesis11 and in the reduction of
left ventricular hypertrophy of hypertensive patients.12
carvedilol has been shown to be effective in the management of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. in a recent study carvedilol administered on
top of an ace inhibitor and a diuretic in chronic heart failure
was superior to metoprolol in reducing mortality.26 since it is
well documented that inhibition of ace is incomplete using
any orally administered ace inhibitor, and that ace inhibitors in fact increase tissue ace,27 a decrease of ace expression by carvedilol may contribute to the difference. thus, inhibition of basal and stimulated endothelial ace biosynthesis
may be an additional potentially beneficial action of carvedilol.
