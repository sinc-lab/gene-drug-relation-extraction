both  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic receptors (beta1ars and beta3ars) are present on nuclear membranes in adult
ventricular myocytes. these nuclear-localized receptors are functional with respect to ligand binding and
effector activation. in isolated cardiac nuclei, the non-selective betaar agonist  xxxd2401xxx  stimulated de
novo rna synthesis measured using assays of transcription initiation (boivin et al., 2006 cardiovasc res.
71:69–78). in contrast, stimulation of endothelin receptors, another  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  (gpcr) that
localizes to the nuclear membrane, resulted in decreased rna synthesis. to investigate the signalling
pathway(s) involved in gpcr-mediated regulation of rna synthesis, nuclei were isolated from intact adult
rat hearts and treated with receptor agonists in the presence or absence of inhibitors of different mitogenactivated protein kinase (mapk) and pi3k/pkb pathways. components of  xxxg1366xxx , jnk, and  xxxg1369xxx /2 map kinase
cascades as well as pkb were detected in nuclear preparations. inhibition of pkb with  xxxd3427xxx , in the
presence of  xxxd2401xxx , converted the activation of the betaar from stimulatory to inhibitory with regards to
rna synthesis, while  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk and  xxxg1366xxx  inhibition reduced both basal and  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated
activity. analysis by qpcr indicated an increase in the expression of 18 s rrna following  xxxd2401xxx 
treatment and a decrease in  xxxg1559xxx  mrna. further qpcr experiments revealed that  xxxd2401xxx  treatment
also reduced the expression of several other genes involved in the activation of  xxxg1559xxx , while  xxxg1369xxx /2 and pkb
inhibition substantially reversed this effect. our results suggest that gpcrs on the nuclear membrane
regulate nuclear functions such as gene expression and this process is modulated by activation/inhibition of
downstream protein kinases within the nucleus.

beta-adrenergic receptors (betaars) are part of the gpcr superfamily
that signal through heterotrimeric g proteins. gpcrs activate a wide
range of downstream effectors and regulate diverse cellular functions
in cardiomyocytes, including contractility, metabolism and gene
expression. additionally, the downstream signalling pathways activated following ligand binding can vary depending on the composition of heterotrimeric g proteins, and particularly which alpha subunits
interact with the receptor.
in mammalian cardiomyocytes, all three known betaar subtypes
have been detected. beta1ars are the predominant subtype found in the
heart, representing roughly 70% of the total betaar density [1]. primarily
involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contractility, beta1ars are
known to signal through galphas and adenylyl cyclase (ac). beta2ars,
representing roughly 30% of the total betaar density, are also involved in
the regulation of the contractility, but to a lesser extent [2]. beta1ars and

beta2ars signal through galphas and ac with similar efﬁcacy. however, the
signals are compartmentalized differently in cardiomyocytes, possibly
due to their localization in distinct membrane microdomains and/or
dual coupling of the  xxxg92xxx  to galphas and galphai [3]. beta2ars also have a high
level of spontaneous activity not detected for  xxxg91xxx  [4]. during the
development of heart failure, beta1ars are internalized, their synthesis is
reduced, and they begin to signal predominantly through a ca2+/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii)-dependent mechanism, while beta2ars switch from galphas to galphai signalling, potentially
activating cardioprotective mechanisms [2]. additionally, expression
and activity of  xxxg970xxx  (betaark1), the primary gpcr kinase (grk) in the
heart, is increased during the development of heart failure, providing
a molecular mechanism for betaar desensitization in heart failure [1].
while beta3ars are also expressed in healthy cardiomyocytes, their
functions remain ill-deﬁned, and they represent a negligible part of
the total betaar density [1]. in fact, as opposed to the beta1ars and beta2ars,
beta3ars appear to have negative inotropic effects and are actually upregulated in response to heart failure [5]. hence, betaar subtypes likely
play non-redundant roles within the cardiomyocyte.
recently, evidence has accrued showing that functional gpcrs are
not solely localized at the plasma membrane but can also signal from
different endogenous membrane compartments, including the nuclear membrane (reviewed in [6]). recent evidence also seems to
indicate that these intracellular receptors may have the capacity to
regulate signalling pathways that differ from those of their plasma
membrane counterparts, as was recently demonstrated for the
 xxxg974xxx  ( xxxg974xxx ) [7]. in the case of the
betaars, functional  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg93xxx , but not the  xxxg92xxx , have been detected
at the level of the nuclear membrane in rat and mouse adult
ventricular myocytes [8]. moreover, several studies have demonstrated that a number of their normal cell surface interactors, including
galphas, galphai, galphaq, adenylyl cyclase, and pka, as well as other regulatory
molecules known to interact with gpcrs, are also associated with the
nucleus or the nuclear membrane [9,10]. in fact, literature even seems
to support the existence of nuclear-localized phosphoinositide
signalling pathways that can regulate nuclear pkb/akt signalling
[11]. furthermore, betaars on the nuclear membrane have been shown
to be functional with respect to both ligand binding and effector
activation [8]. indeed, in isolated nuclei, beta1ars activate ac following
treatment with  xxxd2401xxx , while beta3ars appear to stimulate de
novo transcription, through galphai activation [8]. however, the postreceptor signalling pathways that become activated following ligand
binding and lead to changes in gene transcription remain to be
identiﬁed.
given the presence of gpcrs at the level of the nuclear membrane,
we wished to assess what role they might play in adult cardiomyocytes, and to determine what pathways might be activated downstream of nuclear receptor activation and lead to modulation of gene
transcription. to this end we used a pharmacological approach to
investigate the involvement of different mapks and the pi3k/pkb
pathway.

2.2. isolation of nuclei
rat cardiac nuclei were isolated as described previously [12].
brieﬂy, rat hearts were pulverized under liquid nitrogen, resuspended
in cold pbs, and homogenized (polytron, 8000 rpm; 2 × 10 s, fraction
1). all subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 5 °c.
homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 500 ×g. the resulting
supernatants, referred to as fraction 2, were diluted 1:1 with buffer a
(10 mm k-hepes (ph 7.9), 1.5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm kcl, 1 mm dtt,
25 mug/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm na3vo4), incubated 10 min on ice, and
centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 ×g. the resulting supernatant was
discarded. the pellet, referred to as crude nuclei (fraction 3) was
resuspended in buffer b (0.3 m k-hepes ph 7.9, 1.5 m kcl, 0.03 m
mgcl2, 25 mug/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm na3vo4), incubated on ice for
20 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 ×g. the pellet, an enriched
nuclear fraction (fraction 4), was resuspended in buffer c (20 mm nahepes (ph 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m nacl, 1.5 mm mgcl2,
0.2 mm edta, 0.2 mm egta, 0.5 mm pmsf, 0.5 mm dtt, 25 mug/ml

7.9, 0.15 m kcl, 1 mm mncl2, 6 mm mgcl2, 1 mm atp, 2 mm dtt, 1 u/
mul rnase inhibitor) and either used fresh or aliquoted, snap-frozen
using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °c.

2.3. transcription initiation
measurements of transcription initiation were performed as
previously described [8]. brieﬂy, 10 mul of isolated nuclei (resuspended
in 1 x transcription buffer) were incubated at 30 °c for 30 min in the
presence of the indicated agonist/antagonist and 10 muci [alpha32p]utp
(3000 ci/mmol). ctp and gtp were omitted to prevent chain
elongation. following termination of reactions by digestion with
dnase i, nuclei were lysed with 10 mm tris–hcl ph 8.0, 10 mm edta
and 1% sds. duplicate 5 mul aliquots were transferred onto whatman
gf/c glass ﬁber ﬁlters, washed twice with 5% tca containing 20 mm
sodium pyrophosphate, and air-dried. 32p incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. dna concentrations were
determined spectrophotometrically and [32p]utp incorporation
expressed as cpm/mug dna. where indicated, isolated nuclei were
pre-treated with the appropriate pharmacological inhibitors. nuclei

nuclei by protein kinases

2.5. quantitative real-time pcr
rna was isolated from puriﬁed nuclei using qiagen rna extraction
kits. to prepare cdna, 1 mug of rna was mixed with 100 ng of random
primers and 1 mul of 10 mm dntp mix, diluted to a ﬁnal volume of 10 mul,
heated to 65 °c for 5 min, and then immediately quick chilled on ice.
next, 4 mul of 5 x ﬁrst strand buffer, 2 mul of 0.1 m dtt and 1 mul of rnase
out were added, and reactions were incubated for 2 min at 37 °c.
following the addition of 1 mul of m-mlv reverse transcriptase
(200 units), reactions were mixed, centrifuged and then incubated
for 10 min at 25 °c, 50 min at 37 °c, and ﬁnally 15 min at 70 °c. qpcr
reactions, containing 12.5 mul of sybr green pcr master mix, 0.03 mul
rox dye (an internal ﬂuorescence standard), 2.5 mul of primers, and
10 mul of cdna were 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °c, then 40 cycles of (30 s
at 95 °c, followed by 1 min at 60 °c and 1 min at 72 °c) using a
stratagene mx3000p system. samples were assayed in triplicate and
normalized to  xxxg53xxx  expression. primers used for real-time qpcr are
shown in table 1. the speciﬁcity of each primer pair for the amplicon
of interest was veriﬁed by dissociation curve analysis.

we have shown previously that  xxxd2401xxx  (iso) increases de
novo rna synthesis in nuclei freshly isolated from rat heart [8]. mapk
and pkb signalling are known to lead to the phosphorylation of a
variety of transcription factors, including some that are regulated by
multiple signalling pathways.  xxxg1369xxx /2 primarily activates activator
protein-1 (ap-1) through its coordinated stimulation of c-fos, while
jnk also activates ap-1, though through its control of c-jun
expression [13]. pkb on the other hand primarily activates the foxo
family of transcription factors as well as  xxxg1559xxx  [14]. moreover, atf-2
and p53 can be activated by jnk as well as  xxxg1366xxx  mapk, while c-myc has
been shown to be activated by  xxxg1369xxx /2, erk5 and jnk [15–17]. hence,
it is reasonable to propose that one or more of these pathways may be
involved in regulating transcription in response to activation of betaars
in the nuclear membrane. first, we set out to determine if the  xxxg1369xxx /2
mapk pathway modulated the effects of betaar stimulation on
transcriptional initiation. freshly isolated nuclei were incubated
with iso (1 mum), in the absence or presence of an inhibitor of either
 xxxg1361xxx /2 activation ( xxxd1169xxx ) or activity ( xxxd3462xxx ), and [alpha32p]utp to

2.6. rt2 proﬁler pcr arrays
rna was isolated from puriﬁed nuclei using qiagen rna
extraction kits. cdna was prepared from 1 mug of rna using the
sabiosciences rt2 first strand kit. cdna (102 mul) was mixed with
1275 mul of 2 x sabiosciences rt2 qpcr master mix plus 1173 mul of
ddh2o and 25 mul of the ﬁnal mixture was transferred to each well of
the rt2 pcr array. arrays were assayed for 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °c,
then 40 cycles of (15 s at 95 °c, followed by 1 min at 60 °c) using a
stratagene mx3000p system. all conditions were done in triplicate
and normalized to the vehicle control. each 96-well plate also
included primers for 5 housekeeping genes as well as positive and
negative controls. results were analyzed using web-based analysis
software (sabiosciences). changes were considered signiﬁcant when
p b 0.05.
2.7. statistical analysis
data are presented as the mean ± the standard error of the
mean (s.e.m.). the signiﬁcance of differences between groups was
determined using one-way anova followed by tukey's multiple
comparison tests (prism 4.0cx, graphpad software). differences were
considered signiﬁcant when p b 0.05.
2.8. miscellaneous methods
protein concentrations were determined by the method of
bradford using bovine gamma-globulin as a standard.

measure initiation of rna transcription. endothelin type b receptors
(etb) have also been shown to be present on the nuclear envelope
[12]; hence, puriﬁed nuclei were also treated with  xxxg674xxx  (et-1,
10 nm). interestingly, whereas iso increased [32p]utp incorporation
(fig. 1a) treatment with et-1 decreased rna transcription below
control levels. treatment with  xxxd1169xxx  also resulted in a decrease in
basal levels of de novo transcription whereas  xxxd3462xxx  did not
suggesting a difference between having activatable  xxxg1361xxx /2 or not.
however, pre-treatment with either  xxxd1169xxx  or  xxxd3462xxx  blocked the
increase in rna synthesis following iso treatment. neither compound
altered the inhibition of rna synthesis induced by et-1, suggesting
that the signals from betaar and etb are compartmentalized differently.
the presence of the activated, phosphorylated form of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in
isolated nuclei was conﬁrmed by immunoblot, where isolated nuclei
were pretreated with either vehicle, iso, microcystin lr, or iso and
microcystin lr and then probed with anti-phosphoerk1/2 (p42/ xxxd1355xxx ,
fig. 2a). the presence of other components of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway
was also assessed by immunoblotting, with the results demonstrating
the presence of both  xxxg1924xxx  and the phosphorylated form of  xxxg1361xxx /2
(figs. 2b and 3a). the ability of  xxxd1169xxx  to reduce the basal level of
transcription, taken together with the ability of both  xxxd1169xxx  and
 xxxd3462xxx  to block the iso-induced up regulation of rna synthesis, and
the presence of  xxxg1924xxx ,  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 immunoreactivity,
demonstrate that all of the components of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 mapk pathway
are present in the nucleus and appear to be already in an activated
form prior to betaar stimulation.  xxxd2401xxx  treatment did not
activate nuclear  xxxg1369xxx /2 per se. a number of signals likely converge
on  xxxg1369xxx /2 and other mapks suggesting that the net state of their
activation may serve a modulatory role for betaar-mediated
transcription.
next, we examined the potential involvement of the  xxxg1366xxx  and jnk
mapk pathways. pre-treatment with  xxxd3177xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg1368xxx 
and p38beta activity, again resulted in the inhibition of basal rna synthesis
(fig. 1b), while pre-treatment with  xxxd3231xxx  (which inhibits jnk)
showed an inhibitory trend that did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
both  xxxd3177xxx  and  xxxd3231xxx  blocked the iso-induced increase in
transcription, but had no appreciable effect on the inhibition of
transcription induced by et-1, again highlighting differences in how
the two signalling pathways are organized in nuclei. both  xxxg1366xxx  and jnk
were detected by immunoblot (fig. 3b,c), however levels of phosphop38 and phospho-jnk were too low to detect with the antibodies
available (data not shown). these results indicate that both the  xxxg1366xxx  and
jnk mapk signalling cascades are present within the nucleus. the ability
of  xxxg1366xxx  and jnk inhibitors to completely block iso-induced up regulation
of rna synthesis, while not being directly activated by  xxxd2401xxx 
treatment, seems to indicate that these mapks might also play
important modulatory roles in this process. thus the different mapk
systems all seem to mediate the ability of betaar to increase transcriptional
activity. systems which control mapk activity or distribution in the
nucleus would either be permissive or restrictive to transcriptional
regulation by betaar.
we then turned our attention to the pi3k/pkb pathway.  xxxd2523xxx 
and  xxxd3536xxx  (which inhibit pi3k) both inhibited de novo
transcription in the absence of agonist stimulation (fig. 4a), and
blocked the increase in transcription in response to iso. again neither
inhibitor had any effect on et-1 induced inhibition. in line with these
experiments, it was not surprising that pre-treatment with the pkb
inhibitor  xxxd3427xxx  alone resulted in a similar decrease in basal de
novo transcription since pkb is downstream of pi3k (fig. 4b). a
striking ﬁnding was that  xxxd3427xxx  not only blocked the increase in
transcription produced by iso, but actually converted the normal
stimulatory effect of iso to an inhibitory one, i.e. levels of rna
synthesis initiation were lower in the presence of  xxxd3427xxx  and iso
than with  xxxd3427xxx  alone. thus, the ability of  xxxd3427xxx  to turn iso
from stimulatory to inhibitory indicates that iso, when pkb cannot be
activated, becomes an  xxxd1422xxx  for the transcriptional pathway.

3.2. regulation of beta-adrenergic transcriptional responses in isolated
nuclei by protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity
given that  xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1366xxx , jnk and pkb are all protein serine/
threonine kinases, we next examined the involvement of protein
serine/threonine phosphatase activity in regulating [32p]utp incorporation. microcystin lr, a potent inhibitor of type i and iia protein
serine/threonine phosphatases, produced 50% increases in transcription initiation with vehicle, iso, and et-1 (fig. 5). the latter
observation is interesting in the sense that it changes the direction of
et-1 signalling with respect to transcription initiation in an
analogous way to how  xxxd3427xxx  affected the response to iso.
since pkb inhibition converted iso from an activator into an
inhibitor of transcriptional initiation, the effect of iso and microcystin upon pkb phosphorylation was also examined. isolated nuclei
were pretreated with either vehicle, iso, microcystin lr, or iso and
microcystin, and either phospho-pkb threonine 308 or serine 473
was quantiﬁed by immunoblotting. treatment with microcystin
increased phosphorylation of pkb at both threonine 308 and serine
473 (fig. 6a,b) indicating the presence of, and dephosphorylation
by, type i and/or iia protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity in
isolated nuclei. additionally, although iso alone did not increase pkb
phosphorylation at either threonine 308 or serine 473, treatment
with iso in the presence of microcystin increased the level of pkb
phosphorylation at both sites, particularly in the case of serine
473, indicating that iso is in fact able to activate pkb in the nucleus,
but that pkb is subject to rapid dephosphorylation. the levels of
both total  xxxg1366xxx  and total pkb immunoreactivity remained constant
(figs. 2a and 6a,b), conﬁrming that the changes in phospho-pkb
levels were due to activation of local pkb pools in isolated nuclei
following receptor stimulation.
3.3. targets of beta-adrenergic transcriptional responses in isolated nuclei
we next wished to determine which type(s) of rna were being
altered upon stimulation of betaar on isolated nuclear membranes.

ribosomal rna (rrna) represents the majority of the rna within the
cell. consequently, to identify if an increase in rrna synthesis was
responsible for the observed increase in de novo rna synthesis,
isolated nuclei were treated with iso or vehicle for 30 min, 1, 6, 12 or

nuclear fractions were stimulated with either 1 mum  xxxd2401xxx  or vehicle for 30 min

fig. 8. detection of  xxxg1559xxx  following treatment with  xxxd2401xxx . enriched nuclear fractions were treated as described in fig. 2a, separated by sds-page, transferred to nitrocellulose and
probed with an anti- xxxg1559xxx  antibody. expression of  xxxg1559xxx  was normalized to the levels of lamin b protein. images on the left of each panel show representative immunoblots and data on the

24 h and the quantity of 18 s rrna determined by qpcr, and
normalized against  xxxg53xxx  mrna. large variations in the abundance
of 18 s rrna could be seen at the later time points, including a
decrease at 12 h and a signiﬁcant increase at 24 h (data not shown).
however, a closer examination of the qpcr data revealed the
variability observed from the 6 h time point forward was due to
changes in both 18 s rrna and  xxxg53xxx  mrna levels, which appeared
to be degraded more rapidly in the iso treated samples. for that
reason we decided to focus solely on the 30 min time point. a
signiﬁcant increase, of close to 5 fold, in 18 s rrna was observed,
indicating that an increase in rrna is likely primarily responsible for
the increase in global transcription observed upon betaar stimulation
(fig. 7a).
we also wanted to determine whether mrna abundance was
affected in response to activation of betaar in the nuclear membrane.
given that  xxxg1559xxx  is a well characterized transcription factor downstream of pkb signalling, and its message levels have recently been
shown to be regulated by another nuclear gpcr, the type 1
 xxxg99xxx  receptor (at-1) [18], we reasoned that it might be an
interesting candidate. using primers directed against nfkappab1, we
observed a decrease in  xxxg1559xxx  mrna levels after 30 min of stimulation
with iso (fig. 7b). these results were further conﬁrmed at the protein
level as a small decrease in  xxxg1559xxx  was observed following treatment
with iso (fig. 8). levels of  xxxg1559xxx  protein were normalized using an
anti-lamin b antibody. hence, the abundance of  xxxg1559xxx  mrna appears
to be down-regulated by nuclear betaar stimulation. the fact that
inhibition of rna polymerase ii (rnap ii), with alpha-amanitin,
substantially reduced the effects of iso on transcription initiation
(fig. 9a) also suggests that some of the transcriptional events depend
on this enzyme. iso reduced  xxxg1559xxx  mrna levels and no added effect
was observed in the presence of alpha-amanitin (fig. 9b). interestingly,
we also noted an effect of alpha-amanitin on 18 s rrna levels, which
depends on rnap i (fig. 9c).
to further explore the regulation exerted by nuclear betaars on the
 xxxg1559xxx  pathway, we used rt2 proﬁler pcr arrays (purchased from
sabiosciences) with rna from isolated nuclei treated with iso or
vehicle for 30 min in the presence or absence of either  xxxg1369xxx /2
inhibition ( xxxd3462xxx ) or pkb inhibition ( xxxd3427xxx , table 2). the
abundance of several transcripts was signiﬁcantly altered in each of
the conditions. consistent with our initial experiments with  xxxg1559xxx ,
treatment with iso also resulted in the down-regulation of atf-2,
 xxxg1171xxx  and  xxxg2301xxx , along with the modest up-regulation of ripk2.  xxxg206xxx   xxxg882xxx , which is known to interact with c-jun, is a transcription factor
primarily regulated by the stress activated mapks jnk and  xxxg1366xxx  and is
known to play a role in the hypertrophic response [19], while  xxxg1171xxx  is
mainly involved in the immune and inﬂammatory response, through
its interaction with  xxxg1489xxx , although it also plays a role in the
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  [20].  xxxg2301xxx  plays a role in the activation of  xxxg1559xxx ,
but only in the absence of rip proteins like ripk2 [21]. taken together

these results support the idea that iso stimulation leads to general
inhibition of the  xxxg1559xxx  pathway along with the suppression of the
inﬂammatory response.
further, isolated nuclei pretreated with  xxxd3462xxx  prior to iso
stimulation showed an increase in irak2,  xxxg1489xxx  and ippk along
with a decrease in traf3. both the protein kinase irak2 and adaptor
protein  xxxg1489xxx  play key roles in the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  [22], whereas
traf3 has been shown to inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation [23]. the role of the
enzyme ippk is still unclear, but it has been shown to play a role in the
inhibition of apoptosis [24]. in addition, c-jun is also up-regulated in
comparison to the iso stimulated nuclei. our results indicate that
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by  xxxd3462xxx  in the presence of iso leads
to the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  and the suppression of apoptosis. hence,
 xxxd3462xxx  completely reverses the inhibitory effect exerted on the  xxxg1559xxx 
pathway by iso stimulation, indicating that  xxxg1369xxx /2 might be
responsible for this inhibitory effect.
isolated nuclei pretreated with  xxxd3427xxx  prior to iso stimulation
showed an increase in  xxxg340xxx  and lpar1 mrna, along with increases in
 xxxd3123xxx , tlr6 and  xxxg2301xxx  that were not quite statistically signiﬁcant.
 xxxg340xxx  is an enzyme involved in the up-regulation of inﬂammation and
apoptosis [25], while lpar1 is a gpcr involved in developmental,
physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, and has also been shown
to activate pkb as well as rho pathways [26]. in addition,  xxxd3123xxx  and
 xxxg2301xxx  both have been shown to play a role in the activation of  xxxg1559xxx 
and apoptosis [21], while tlr6, through its interaction with tlr2, is
involved in the immune response [27]. hence, it appears that pkb
inhibition leads to an increase in the abundance of mrnas arising
from genes important for induction of apoptosis, suggesting a role for
pkb in the inhibition of apoptosis following nuclear betaar stimulation.
the results of the rt2 pcr arrays were in accordance with the qpcr
data, where iso stimulation leads to the reduction of  xxxg1559xxx  mrna,
while also demonstrating a role for both  xxxg1369xxx /2 and pkb in
modulating this pathway. taken together, our data indicate that
nuclear betaar modulate a number of transcriptional events through
localized signalling pathways (i.e. pkb activation) and these are
modulated by the tone of  xxxg1366xxx ,  xxxg1366xxx  and protein phosphatase signalling
in the nucleus.
4. discussion
we have demonstrated that gpcrs located on the nuclear
membrane are not only functional with respect to ligand binding
and effector activation, but also can play very distinct roles in regards
to the regulation of rna synthesis (summarized in fig. 10). whereas
betaar activation has been shown previously to both activate ac via gs
and stimulate global rna synthesis via gi [8], we now show that etr
activation by et-1 has the opposite effect, actually inhibiting de novo
rna synthesis, in a protein phosphatase-sensitive manner. these two
types of gpcrs exert opposing effects on rna synthesis indicates that

they either integrate signals relevant for target binding sites in the
genome or may have distinct sets of targets. additionally, betaars in the
nuclear membrane, similarly to the betaars located at the level of the
plasma membrane, appear to be able to activate the pi3k/pkb
pathway, a process which also appears to be highly regulated via
serine/threonine phosphatases. mapk signalling pathways, although
not directly activated by the betaar in the nucleus, do in fact modulate
the ability of betaar to mediate transcriptional events, again in a manner
that is sensitive to serine/threonine phosphatase inhibition. different
levels of control are also suggested by the differences in basal

transcriptional activity in the presence of an activatable mek or not.
whereas  xxxd1169xxx  inhibits  xxxg1361xxx /2 activation,  xxxd3462xxx  inhibits  xxxg1361xxx /2
activity. as a result, in the nuclei treated with  xxxd3462xxx ,  xxxg1361xxx /2 can still
be activated and hence might play some other role unrelated to its
kinase activity per se, perhaps as a scaffold.
nuclear-targeted pkb overexpression has previously been shown
to have several beneﬁcial effects including enhanced contractility and
protection from ischaemic injury [28], while sustained pkb activation
can lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy primarily via phosphorylation of substrates localized to the cytoplasm [11,29], indicating that
pkb not only plays important roles in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes,
but that these roles can differ depending on its localization.
furthermore, we show that inhibition of pkb with  xxxd3427xxx  causes
iso to behave as an  xxxd1422xxx , leading to the inhibition of rna
synthesis, as opposed to its previously noted stimulatory effect. at the
level of the plasma membrane, pi3k activation leads to the
recruitment of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 ( xxxg1714xxx   xxxg1718xxx ) and
pkb via their pleckstrin homology (ph) domains, where  xxxg1714xxx   xxxg1718xxx  is able
to phosphorylate pkb at threonine 308 and thereby activate it [30].
once activated, pkb can accumulate both in the cytoplasm and the
nucleus [11,31,32]. however, inhibition of pi3k with either
 xxxd3536xxx  or  xxxd2523xxx  did not produce the same effect, indicating
that either pkb activation in this case might be mediated by another
pathway, or that pkb is only one of multiple effectors activated
downstream of pi3k in the nucleus. one such possibility would be that
pkb is being activated by dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk)
through the control of camp levels [33,34], although in this case dnapk would not be exported, but would instead phosphorylate pkb
within the nucleus. moreover, it is unclear how inhibition of pkb with
 xxxd3427xxx  reverses the effect of iso treatment on transcriptional
activity. one possibility is that the conformational state of the receptor
is altered such that iso now acts as an  xxxd1422xxx  for the
transcriptional pathway. recent evidence demonstrates that betaar
inverse agonists for ac may act as agonists for activation of mapks via
a beta-arrestin-mediated pathway [35]. in our case, similar pleiotropic
effects of iso may result from pkb-mediated alterations in the
receptor or its signalling partners, leading to the inhibition of de novo
rna synthesis, when pkb is inhibited and activation when it remains
activatible. given the high level of basal rna transcription seen, in the
case where pkb is inhibited, iso might simply be inhibiting the
spontaneous activity of these nuclear localized receptors in a
functionally selective manner. further experiments to examine the
involvement of beta-arrestin in this pathway and the identiﬁcation of the
relevant pkb targets are required. at this point, it is still unclear if the
nuclear localized receptors interact with beta-arrestin or grks although
both are present in the nucleus [36,37]. pim-1, a protein kinase
downstream of pkb, may also be involved as it plays a pivotal role in
the inhibition of both apoptosis and hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes,
and its expression affects both jnk and  xxxg1366xxx  pathways [38]. this may
in part explain why each of the mapk pathways appears to play some
role in the betaar stimulated increase in de novo rna synthesis.
additionally, pim-1 has been shown to phosphorylate and stabilize cmyc [39]. given the established role of c-myc as an activator of rnap i
[40], this may suggest a pathway involving the receptor, pkb and
rnap i being important for rrna transcription.
although the bulk of the transcriptional response to betaars
stimulation involved synthesis of rrna, we did detect regulation of
speciﬁc mrna targets, such as  xxxg1559xxx , which was down-regulated in
response to treatment with iso, and our experiments with alphaamanitin demonstrate a role for rnap ii in the receptor-mediated
transcriptional responses. the effects on rrna transcription in
response to pretreatment with alpha-amanitin were somewhat surprising. a similar effect of alpha-amanitin on rnap i- and rnap iii-transcribed
genes has been reported previously [41,42] and rnap ii was recently
shown to bind near and regulate the transcription of genes
transcribed by rnap iii [41]. alternatively, it may be that signalling

via the betaar alters the activity and/or distribution of shared
components of rnap i and rnap ii but this is beyond the scope of
the present study.
genes for other modulators and targets of the  xxxg1559xxx  pathway, such
as atf-2 and  xxxg2301xxx  were also down-regulated. nuclear gpcrs may
therefore be important regulators of both apoptosis and the
inﬂammatory pathway in the heart. moreover, the fact that both
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and pkb inhibition seem to reverse the effects of iso
stimulation on these identiﬁed genes would seem to indicate that
both pathways play a role in the regulation of gene expression by
nuclear betaars. this may be through mapk or pkb modulation of the

signalling proteins themselves, modulation of the transcriptional
machinery or via alterations in the occupancy of chromatin sites by
 xxxg1366xxx  and other protein kinases [43,44]. further, given the already
identiﬁed role of mapks in regulating mrna stability [45], further
experiments need to be conducted to determine if the regulation that
we see is actually due to a changes in the level of de novo mrna
synthesis or reduced mrna stability. these results reveal that betaars
located on the nuclear envelope can in fact affect speciﬁc genes, and
pathways, though further large-scale analysis by microarray would be
useful in developing a broader picture of genes regulated by these
receptors.

5. conclusions
we have shown that etb and betaars in the nuclear membrane can
effect rna synthesis, and in opposing ways, implying that they have
different roles to play in regulating this process. additionally, using a
pharmacological approach we have shown that mapk and pkb
modulate rna synthesis observed following iso treatment in isolated
nuclei. moreover, we show that not only is rrna synthesis increased
but speciﬁc mrna targets, such as  xxxg1559xxx , also appear to be regulated.
together, these results begin to demonstrate that not only are these
gpcrs present at the level of the nuclear membrane, functional with
respect to ligand binding and effector activation, but also have a role
to play in the regulation of gene transcription, in addition to other
functions yet to be discovered.
