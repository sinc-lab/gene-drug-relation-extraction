indomethacin and other nsaids1 are used clinically for
their anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic properties
(1). the molecular basis for the therapeutic actions of nsaids
is believed to be their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (cox)
activity and thereby block the production of prostaglandins
(pgs). two cox enzymes have been identified. cox-1 is constitutively expressed, and the pgs produced by this enzyme are
thought to function in the so-called housekeeping functions of
the cell; in contrast, the cox-2 isozyme is an inducible enzyme
that is normally absent from cells but is expressed in response

to growth factors, tumor promoters, and cytokines (2). most of
the nsaids inhibit both cox-1 and cox-2, although they vary
in their relative potencies against the two cox isozymes (3).
indomethacin is also widely used as a research tool to study
the process of adipocyte differentiation. while there is at least
one report of indomethacin blocking adipocyte differentiation
(4), treatment of several preadipocyte cell lines with this drug
results in their terminal differentiation (5–7). early reports
suggested that indomethacin might function as an adipogenic
agent through its inhibition of cox activity. however, two
lines of evidence indicate that the adipogenic activity of indomethacin cannot simply be ascribed to the inhibition of cox.
first, the concentration of drug required to induce differentiation is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that required to
inhibit cox activity, and second, several nsaids that inhibit
cox activity fail to induce adipocyte differentiation (7). thus,
the mechanism underlying the adipogenic activity of indomethacin has remained obscure.
insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for adipocyte differentiation was recently provided by the identification of a ligand-activated transcription factor, termed  xxxg1807xxx ,
as a key regulator of adipogenesis (8).  xxxg1807xxx , a member of the
nuclear receptor superfamily, is selectively expressed in adipocytes and induced early during the course of differentiation of
several preadipocyte cell lines (9, 10). forced expression of
 xxxg1807xxx  in fibroblast and myoblast cell lines results in efficient
adipocyte differentiation in a  xxxg1807xxx -activator-dependent fashion (8, 11). thus,  xxxg1807xxx  functions as a master regulator of
adipocyte differentiation. two other ppar subtypes, termed
 xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx , have been identified in addition to  xxxg1807xxx 
(12, 13).  xxxg1805xxx  is the predominant ppar subtype expressed in
liver and is activated by a group of chemicals that induce the
proliferation of peroxisomes in rodents (14). gene disruption
experiments have demonstrated that  xxxg1805xxx  is required for the
pleiotropic hepatic response to peroxisome proliferators in
rodents (15).
work from several laboratories had shown that pgs have
marked effects, both positive and negative, on adipocyte differentiation (4, 16 –19). interestingly,  xxxg1807xxx  is activated by pgs
and pg-like molecules (20 –23). recently, the  xxxd208xxx 
metabolite 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 was shown to bind directly to
 xxxg1807xxx  and to promote the efficient conversion of fibroblast and
mesenchymal stem cell lines to adipocytes (24, 25). the finding
that a pg functions as a  xxxg1807xxx  ligand and promotes adipocyte
differentiation provided additional evidence that products of
the cox pathway play an important role in modulating
adipogenesis.
if prostanoids can function as  xxxg1807xxx  ligands and induce
adipogenesis, how then does a cox inhibitor such as indomethacin, which blocks pg synthesis, promote adipocyte differentiation? in this report, we show that indomethacin and

indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (nsaid) and cyclooxygenase inhibitor that is frequently used as a research tool to study the process of
adipocyte differentiation. treatment of various preadipocyte cell lines with micromolar concentrations of indomethacin in the presence of insulin promotes their
terminal differentiation. however, the molecular basis
for the adipogenic actions of indomethacin had remained unclear. in this report, we show that indomethacin binds and activates peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor g (ppar g ), a ligand-activated
transcription factor known to play a pivotal role in adipogenesis. the concentration of indomethacin required
to activate  xxxg1807xxx  is in good agreement with that required to induce the differentiation of c3h10t1/2 cells
to adipocytes. we demonstrate that several other
nsaids, including fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and  xxxd2122xxx , are also  xxxg1807xxx  ligands and induce adipocyte differentiation of c3h10t1/2 cells. finally, we show
that the same nsaids that activate  xxxg1807xxx  are also efficacious activators of  xxxg1805xxx , a liver-enriched ppar
subtype that plays a key role in peroxisome proliferation. interestingly, several nsaids have been reported
to induce peroxisomal activity in hepatocytes both in
vitro and in vivo. our findings define a novel group of
 xxxg1807xxx  ligands and provide a molecular basis for the
biological effects of these drugs on adipogenesis and
peroxisome activity.

several other nsaids function as  xxxg1807xxx  ligands, suggesting a
mechanism for the adipogenic actions of these compounds.
furthermore, we demonstrate that these same nsaids also
activate  xxxg1805xxx , providing a basis for the reported effects of
nsaids on peroxisome activity in liver.
experimental procedures

results

indomethacin activates  xxxg1807xxx —the ppars are activated
by a large number of structurally diverse compounds including
prostanoids, long-chain  xxxd2154xxx , the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs, leukotriene antagonists, and anti-diabetic
thiazolidinediones (13). while chemically diverse, these compounds share certain structural characteristics including a lipophilic backbone and an acid moiety, usually a carboxylate.
indomethacin and many of the other nsaids are amphipathic
carboxylates that share these broad structural features (fig. 1).
this suggested to us that indomethacin might exert its adipogenic effects through direct activation of  xxxg1807xxx .
we tested the possibility that indomethacin activates  xxxg1807xxx 
via a transient transfection assay. an established chimera system was used (28) in which the lbd of  xxxg1807xxx  was fused to the
dna binding domain of the yeast transcription factor gal4.
the advantage of the gal4 chimera assay is that it minimizes
background due to the cell’s endogenous receptors. expression
plasmid for the gal4- xxxg1807xxx  lbd chimera was transfected
into cv-1 cells together with a reporter construct containing
five copies of the gal4 response element driving expression of

the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (uas5-tkcat). dose-response analysis revealed that indomethacin is an
efficacious activator of  xxxg1807xxx , inducing  xxxg1807xxx  activity
roughly 40-fold at 1 3 1024 m (fig. 2). this activation is comparable with the maximal induction obtained with the  xxxg1807xxx 
ligands 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 and the anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione  xxxd3147xxx  (25, 28) (see below). indomethacin activated  xxxg1807xxx  with an ec50 of approximately 4 3 1025 m (fig.
2). similar ec50 and fold activation values were obtained for
indomethacin in transient transfection assays performed with
an expression vector for wild-type  xxxg1807xxx  and a reporter driven
by the fatty acid binding protein/ap2 enhancer region which
contains two  xxxg1807xxx  response elements (10) (fig. 2). thus,
indomethacin is an efficacious activator of  xxxg1807xxx .
indomethacin binds  xxxg1807xxx —we next sought to determine
whether indomethacin activates  xxxg1807xxx  through direct interactions with the receptor. we and others (24, 28) have previously shown that the anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione  xxxd3147xxx 
can bind to  xxxg1807xxx  with high affinity. the ability of indomethacin to bind to  xxxg1807xxx  was assessed in a competition binding
assay using [3h] xxxd3147xxx  and bacterially expressed  xxxg1807xxx 
lbd. as shown in fig. 3, indomethacin competed efficiently
with [3h] xxxd3147xxx  for binding to the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd, with an
ic50 of approximately 1 3 1024 m. in control experiments,
acetaminophen, an nsaid that does not activate  xxxg1807xxx  (see
below), failed to compete with [3h] xxxd3147xxx  for binding to the
 xxxg1807xxx  lbd (fig. 3). these data demonstrate that indomethacin can interact directly and specifically with the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd
and thus define a novel  xxxg1807xxx  ligand.
other classes of nsaids activate  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx —several chemically distinct classes of nsaids are used clinically
including thiazinecarboxamides (e.g.  xxxd2969xxx ) and derivatives of arylacetic acid (e.g. indomethacin), aminoarylcarboxylic
acid (e.g.  xxxd2122xxx ), arylpropionic acid (e.g. ibuprofen
and fenoprofen), and  xxxd3159xxx  (e.g. aspirin) (fig. 1) (1). we
next tested whether representative compounds from the different classes of nsaids could also activate  xxxg1807xxx . cv-1 cells
were transfected with the gal4-pparglbd expression plasmid and the uas5-tk-cat reporter and treated with 1 3 1024
m of  xxxd2969xxx ,  xxxd2122xxx , ibuprofen, fenoprofen, and
 xxxd3159xxx . as shown in fig. 4a,  xxxd2122xxx , fenoprofen,
and ibuprofen were efficient activators of  xxxg1807xxx , activating
the receptor to a degree comparable to that obtained with the
 xxxg1807xxx  ligands  xxxd3147xxx  and 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 and the
peroxisome proliferator wy14,643. however, in contrast to indomethacin, no activation of  xxxg1807xxx  was observed in transfected cells treated with 1 3 1025 m of these compounds (data
not shown). thus, indomethacin is the most potent of the
nsaids that we tested for  xxxg1807xxx  activation. treatment of

cotransfection assay—to generate the psg5-gal4-pparalbd and
psg5-gal4-pparglbd chimeric receptor expression plasmids,
cdnas encoding the ligand binding domains (lbds) of the human
 xxxg1805xxx  (amino acids 167– 468) (26) and the human  xxxg1807xxx  (amino acids
176 – 477) (27) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the psg5-gal4 expression plasmid (28). the pcmv- xxxg1807xxx 
expression plasmid has been described (27). the (uas)5-tk-cat and
ap2-tk-cat reporter plasmids were previously described (28). transient cotransfection assays using these plasmids were performed as
described previously (28).
ligand binding assays—the lbd of human  xxxg1807xxx  (amino acids
176 – 477) (27) was overexpressed in escherichia coli as a histidinetagged fusion protein and bacterial lysates prepared as described previously (25). for competition binding assays, bacterial extracts (approximately 100 mg of protein) containing the  xxxg1807xxx  ligand binding domain
were incubated at 4 °c for 2–3 h with 40 nm [3h] xxxd3147xxx  (specific
activity, 40 ci/mmol) in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor
in buffer containing 10 mm tris (ph 8.0), 50 mm kcl, 10 mm dithiothreitol. bound was separated from free radioactivity by elution through 1ml sephadex g-25 desalting columns (boehringer mannheim). bound
radioactivity eluted in the column void volume and was quantitated by
liquid scintillation counting. data shown are the result of binding
assays performed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at
least twice with similar results.
adipocyte differentiation assays and northern analysis—
c3h10t1/2 clone 8 murine fibroblasts (american type culture collection) were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (life
technologies, inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10
mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. one day after reaching confluence,
the cells were treated with  xxxd3147xxx  or the various nsaids in the
presence of 200 nm insulin. fresh media and test compounds were
added every 2 days. lipogenesis was measured in cells at 9 days
post-confluence as described previously (29). for northern analysis,
total rna was prepared from vehicle- and compound-treated cells using
the rneasy total rna kit (qiagen, chatsworth, ca). fifteen mg of
total rna was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde gel and transferred
to nitrocellulose. the blot was probed with mouse ap2 and  xxxg861xxx 
probes labeled via the random priming technique with [a-32p]dctp.
the results of northern assays were quantitated using a molecular
dynamics computing densitometer and image quant software.

fig. 2. indomethacin activates  xxxg1807xxx . cv-1 cells were transfected with expression plasmid psg5-gal4-pparglbd encoding the
chimeric gal4- xxxg1807xxx  receptor and the uas5-tk-cat reporter plasmid
(dotted line) or, alternatively, expression plasmid for psg5- xxxg1807xxx 
encoding the wild-type  xxxg1807xxx  receptor and reporter plasmid ap2-tkcat (solid line). cells were treated with increasing concentrations (m)
of indomethacin, and cell extracts were subsequently assayed for cat
activity.

transfected cells with  xxxd2969xxx  resulted in only a modest
activation of  xxxg1807xxx  (approximately 5-fold), whereas treatment
with  xxxd3159xxx  or acetaminophen resulted in little or no
induction of reporter expression (fig. 4a). we note that the
compounds that activated  xxxg1807xxx  efficiently (.6-fold) were all
amphipathic acids (fig. 1) and thus conform in their general
structural features to known ppar activators.
the ability of these compounds to interact with  xxxg1807xxx  was
assessed in the competition binding assay using
[3h] xxxd3147xxx . these studies revealed a good correlation between the compounds that activated  xxxg1807xxx  in the transfection
assay and those that interacted directly with the receptor.
although  xxxd2122xxx , fenoprofen, and ibuprofen competed
efficiently with [3h] xxxd3147xxx  for binding to the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd,
little or no competition was seen with  xxxd2969xxx ,  xxxd3159xxx ,
or acetaminophen (fig. 4b). taken together, the transfection
and binding analyses demonstrate that some but not all
nsaids bind and activate  xxxg1807xxx .
for comparative purposes, we also tested the various
nsaids on the  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  subtypes using the transfection assay. little or no activation of  xxxg1806xxx  was seen in the
presence of 1 3 1024 m of these compounds (data not shown).
however, indomethacin, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and flufenamic
acid were efficacious activators of  xxxg1805xxx  at this concentration,
with fenoprofen activating the receptor to a degree comparable
to that obtained with the strong peroxisome proliferator
wy14,643 (fig. 4a). thus, the same nsaids that activate
 xxxg1807xxx  are also efficacious activators of the  xxxg1805xxx  subtype.
nsaids promote adipocyte differentiation—we and others
(24, 25, 28, 30 –33) have shown that treatment of various fibro-

cells were transfected with the uas5-tk-cat reporter plasmid and

the various nsaids, wy14,643 or 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2, or 1 3 1025 m

blast and mesenchymal stem cell lines with  xxxg1807xxx  ligands,
including 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 and the anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones, promotes their efficient conversion to adipocytes.
as discussed, indomethacin is used to promote the terminal
differentiation of preadipocyte cell lines. we next examined
whether the concentration of indomethacin required to activate
 xxxg1807xxx  in cv-1 cells was consistent with that required to
induce adipocyte differentiation. c3h10t1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells were treated with various concentrations of
indomethacin and subsequently assayed for lipogenesis, an
established measure of adipocyte differentiation (29). doseresponse analysis revealed the ec50 for indomethacin in the
lipogenesis assay to be approximately 8 3 1025 m (fig. 5a).
this value is in good agreement with that reported in a previous study (3 3 1025 m) using  xxxg2239xxx  cells, a stable adipogenic cell
line derived from c3h10t1/2 cells (7), and is also consistent
with the ec50 value of indomethacin for  xxxg1807xxx  activation in
the transfection assay (fig. 2). taken together, these data
suggest that  xxxg1807xxx  is the target for the adipogenic actions of
indomethacin.
our finding that  xxxd2122xxx , fenoprofen, and ibuprofen
also activated  xxxg1807xxx  at micromolar concentrations suggested
that these nsaids might also promote adipocyte differentiation. we tested this possibility using c3h10t1/2 cells and the

thiazolidinedione  xxxd3147xxx  or 3 3 1026 m 15-deoxy-d12,14pgj2 resulted in marked increases in adipocyte differentiation
(fig. 5b) (25, 28). as expected, concentrations of the hypolipidemic agent wy14,643 sufficient to activate  xxxg1807xxx  also induced lipogenesis (fig. 5b) (9, 28). treatment of c3h10t1/2

the nsaid indomethacin is frequently included as one of a
mixture of compounds used to promote the terminal differentiation of various preadipocyte cell lines in vitro. this differentiation mixture also routinely includes insulin, corticosteroids,
and  xxxd2388xxx . recent work has indicated that
 xxxd2388xxx  and corticosteroids induce the expression of the genes encoding ccaat/enhancer binding proteins b
and d, respectively, members of the basic region-leucine zipper
family of transcription factors (34). these two transcription
factors are induced early during the course of 3t3-l1 cell
conversion to adipocytes and appear to play key roles in the
differentiation cascade (34 –37). the mechanism underlying
the adipogenic activity of indomethacin, however, has remained unclear. early speculation focused on the ability of
indomethacin to inhibit cox activity. however, knight et al.
(7) showed that the concentration of indomethacin required to
promote the differentiation of  xxxg2239xxx  cells to adipocytes was 1–2
orders of magnitude greater than the concentrations needed to
block prostaglandin synthesis. furthermore, not all cox inhibitors promoted adipocyte differentiation. likewise, we have
found that several cox inhibitors, including the potent nsaid
 xxxd2969xxx  (38), fail to promote adipocyte differentiation. these
data provide compelling evidence that the effects of indomethacin are not mediated through the inhibition of prostaglandin
production.
in searching for the basis of its adipogenic activity, we have
found that indomethacin functions as a micromolar ligand for
the adipogenic transcription factor  xxxg1807xxx .  xxxg1807xxx  is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue where it functions as a key
modulator of the adipocyte differentiation program (8 –10).
 xxxg1807xxx  ligands, including the anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones
and the  xxxd208xxx  metabolite 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2, are
potent inducers of the differentiation of several different fibroblastic cell lines to adipocytes (30 –33). our finding that the
concentration of indomethacin required to induce c3h10t1/2
cell differentiation correlates with that required to activate
 xxxg1807xxx  in the transfection assay provides strong evidence that
the adipogenic actions of this nsaid are mediated through its
binding and activation of  xxxg1807xxx .
while indomethacin is widely used to promote the differen-

cells with 1 3 1024 m of either  xxxd2122xxx  or fenoprofen
promoted lipogenesis, albeit less efficiently than indomethacin
(fig. 5b). the results of the lipogenesis assay were confirmed
by oil red o staining for lipid accumulation in treated cells
(data not shown). the nsaids that did not activate  xxxg1807xxx 
efficiently in the transfection assay, including  xxxd2969xxx ,  xxxd3159xxx , and acetaminophen, failed to induce lipogenesis in
the c3h10t1/2 cells (fig. 5b). we conclude that nsaids other
than indomethacin can also promote adipocyte differentiation
at concentrations at which they activate  xxxg1807xxx .
we note that ibuprofen, which was a less efficacious activator of  xxxg1807xxx  in cv-1 cells than either  xxxd2122xxx  or
fenoprofen (fig. 4a), failed to promote lipogenesis in
c3h10t1/2 cells when tested at 1 3 1024 m (fig. 5b). however,
increasing the concentration of indomethacin to 5 3 1024 m
resulted in significant lipogenesis (fig. 5b). in northern analysis, 1 3 1024 m ibuprofen induced weak expression of the gene
encoding ap2, an adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein
whose expression is directly regulated by  xxxg1807xxx  (fig. 5c) (10).
consistent with the results of the transfection studies, 1 3
1024 m indomethacin stimulated ap2 gene expression approximately 3-fold more efficiently than ibuprofen (fig. 5c). taken
together, these data indicate that ibuprofen is less potent than
indomethacin,  xxxd2122xxx , or fenoprofen in the activation
of  xxxg1807xxx  in both cv-1 and c3h10t1/2 cells.

tiation of preadipocyte cell lines, in at least one instance indomethacin was found to block this process (4). our results together with the recent findings that a subset of the pgs
activate  xxxg1807xxx  (23–25) may provide an explanation for this
paradox. at lower concentrations, indomethacin may block
cox activity, thus inhibiting the formation of adipogenic pgs
and activators of  xxxg1807xxx  such as 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 and
prostacyclin without directly affecting the ppars. at higher
concentrations, however, indomethacin not only inhibits cox
activity but also acts as a  xxxg1807xxx  agonist, promoting adipocyte
differentiation. thus, indomethacin may function to either inhibit or induce adipogenesis depending upon the particular
concentration of drug used in the experiment.
we have shown that the same nsaids that activate  xxxg1807xxx 
also activate  xxxg1805xxx .  xxxg1805xxx  is the predominant ppar subtype expressed in the rodent liver (14, 21). targeted gene
disruption experiments have shown that  xxxg1805xxx  is essential for
the induction of peroxisomal enzymes and peroxisome proliferation in the rodent liver (15). interestingly, several nsaids
have been reported to have marked effects on peroxisome activity in hepatocytes when used either in vitro or in vivo.
indomethacin and ibuprofen induced b-oxidation in peroxisomes of cultured hepatocytes (39). furthermore, treatment of
rats with ibuprofen induced peroxisomal b-oxidation, reduced
serum triglycerides and cholesterol, and increased liver weight
(39). finally, treatment of rats with benoxaprofen, an nsaid
closely related to ibuprofen, at doses comparable to those used
clinically induced peroxisomal b-oxidation and increased cytochrome p4504a1 apoprotein and enoyl-coa hydratase/3- xxxg1013xxx  bifunctional protein levels in
liver (40). expression of both of these genes is known to be
induced by  xxxg1805xxx  in response to peroxisome proliferators (15,
41, 42). as a whole, the effects of these nsaids on liver function are similar to those seen in experiments performed with
the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs (43), agents that are
established activators of  xxxg1805xxx  (14). our data strongly suggest that the actions of nsaids on peroxisomal and liver functions are mediated through the activation of  xxxg1805xxx . we note,
however, that we do not have a binding assay for mammalian
 xxxg1805xxx  and, as a consequence, have not been able to demonstrate direct interactions between the nsaids and  xxxg1805xxx .
thus, it remains possible that the nsaids modulate  xxxg1805xxx 
activity through an indirect mechanism. it is interesting that
nsaids are associated with a variety of detrimental side effects, including hepatotoxicity (1). while there is currently no
evidence of a link between these negative effects and ppars,
evaluation of the activities of nsaids on ppars may be useful
in minimizing the potential for unwanted side effects as new
drugs of this class are developed.
in summary, we have demonstrated that indomethacin and
other nsaids are efficacious activators of  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx 
at micromolar concentrations. these data provide evidence for
a common mechanism underlying the seemingly disparate biological effects of these compounds on the induction of adipocyte differentiation in vitro and peroxisome proliferation in
vivo.

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma are activated by indomethacin
and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
