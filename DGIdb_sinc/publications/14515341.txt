abstract
administration of d-fenﬂuramine (d-fen) or parachloroamphetamine
(pca) can produce long-lasting decreases in serotonin transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) binding and
tissue levels of serotonin (5-ht) in rat forebrain. these changes have been viewed as
evidence for 5-ht neurotoxicity, but no studies have measured  xxxg2150xxx  protein levels. in
the present study, we determined the effect of high-dose d-fen or pca, administered
according to a “neurotoxic” dosing regimen, on the density of  xxxg2150xxx  sites using ligand
binding methods and on  xxxg2150xxx  protein levels using western blots. rats were sacriﬁced
2 days and 2 weeks after administration of drug or saline. the density of  xxxg2150xxx  was
determined in homogenates of caudate and whole brain minus caudate. d-fen and pca
decreased  xxxg2150xxx  binding by 30 – 60% in both tissues and at both time points. similarly,
d-fen and pca administration profoundly decreased tissue 5-ht and 5-hiaa in
frontal cortex. despite the large decreases in  xxxg2150xxx  binding and depletion of tissue 5-ht
that occurred with d-fen administration,  xxxg2150xxx  protein expression, as determined by
western blot analysis, did not change in either tissue or time point. pca administration
decreased  xxxg2150xxx  protein by about 20% only at the 2-day point in the caudate. drug
treatments did not change expression of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (gfap), a hallmark indicator of neuronal damage, in whole brain minus caudate in the 2-week group.
these results support the hypothesis that decreases in tissue 5-ht and  xxxg2150xxx  binding
sites induced by d-fen and pca reﬂect neuroadapative changes, rather than neurotoxic effects. synapse 50:233–239, 2003. published 2003 wiley-liss, inc.†

introduction
it is well established that administration of highdose fenﬂuramine (fen) or d-fenﬂuramine (d-fen) to
laboratory animals produces long-lasting decreases in
markers of the serotonergic (5-ht) nerve terminal (mccann et al., 1997). these markers include depleted
tissue 5-ht levels, impaired 5-ht biosynthesis, and
decreased density of the 5-ht transporter ( xxxg2150xxx )
binding sites (zaczek et al., 1990). viewed collectively,
these data support the hypothesis that administration
of high-dose fen/d-fen causes degeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals, i.e., neurotoxicity (mccann et
al., 1997). on the other hand, some investigators report
that high-dose d-fen decreases brain 5-ht without

corresponding evidence of reactive gliosis, as measured
by glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (gfap), which would
be expected to occur if the 5-ht nerve terminals had
degenerated (o’callaghan and miller, 1994; rowland
et al., 1993). these data suggest that the effects of
high-dose fen/d-fen on serotonergic nerve terminals

may reﬂect adaptive changes rather than true neurotoxicity.
to further test the hypothesis that fenﬂuramine produces 5-ht neurotoxicity, we determined the effect of
high-dose d-fen or parachloroamphetamine (pca)
administration on the  xxxg2150xxx  protein using two different methods:  xxxg2150xxx  binding using standard ligand
binding methods and immunoquantitation of  xxxg2150xxx 
proteins using western blots. for comparative purposes, as an index of reactive gliosis, we also measured
gfap. our results indicate that high-dose d-fen or
pca do not signiﬁcantly change  xxxg2150xxx  or gfap protein
expression.

for d-fen treatments, rats received i.p. injections of
d-fen (6 mg/kg) every 2 h for four doses. for pca
treatments, rats received a single i.p. injection of 5
mg/kg. control rats received i.p. saline injections (1
ml/kg) according to the d-fen protocol. all rats were
sacriﬁced 2 days or 2 weeks later. after sacriﬁce, the

frontal cortex and caudate were dissected and the remainder of the brain tissue (minus cerebellum) was
pooled and termed “whole brain minus caudate.” tissue was kept frozen at –70°c until used in the binding
assays or western blots. the experiments were designed so that western blot analysis and ligand binding experiments were done with tissue from the same
rat. when caudates were used for binding, the corresponding whole brain minus caudate was used for
western blots. similarly, when whole brain minus caudate was used for binding, the corresponding caudates

were used for western blots. in all cases, the prefrontal
cortex was used for measurement of tissue 5-ht.
western blot analysis
western blot analysis of  xxxg2150xxx  protein was ﬁrst done
with a rabbit polyclonal serotonin transporter antibody
(1:100; chemicon international, temecula, ca; 2 h at
34°c). subsequently, conﬁrmatory experiments were
done with a second polyclonal serotonin transporter
antibody obtained from calbiochem (la jolla, ca) (see
below).
brieﬂy, the caudate putamen and whole rat brain
tissue excluding caudate were homogenized in buffer
containing 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl, 1
mm egta, 1 mm pmsf, 0.5% np-40, 0.25% sds, 1
␮g/ml leupeptin, 1 ␮g/ml aprotinin, and 1 ␮g/ml pepstatin. homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000g for 5
min and the supernatant fraction was subsequently
centrifuged at 30,000g for 30 min. the resulting pellet
was resuspended in the sample buffer (62.5 mm trishcl, 10% glycerol, 2% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds),
0.1% bromophenol blue, and 50 mm dithiothreitol) and
subjected to sds-page. proteins (100 ␮g) were electrophoretically separated in sds-10% polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to hybond-p pvdf membrane.
membranes were blocked and incubated with the
chemicon polyclonal serotonin transporter antibody (2
h at 34°c). the primary antibody treatment was followed by treatment with secondary hrp-conjugated
antirabbit igg (1:4,000) for 1 h at 25°c. secondary
antibody-bound proteins were detected using an ecl
chemiluminescence kit (amersham, arlington heights,
il). equal protein loading (100 ␮g) was assured by
measuring samples (bradford, 1976) and subsequently
conﬁrmed by reprobing with ␣-tubulin antibody
(1:2,000; sigma, st. louis, mo; 2 h at room temperature (rt)). the intensity of each band was measured

using an is-1000 digital imaging system (alpha innotech, san leandro, ca) and quantitated using flurochem v. 2.0 software (alphaeasefc analysis software)
(jayanthi et al., 2002).
for the conﬁrmatory experiments, we used rat
whole brain minus caudate from rats sacriﬁced 2
weeks after drug administration. tissues were homogenized by sonication in cold ripa buffer (1%
igepal ca-630, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% sds,
1 mm pmsf, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium
orthovanadate). protein concentrations were determined using the pierce bca protein assay reagent
kit (rockford, il) and homogenates were diluted to a
concentration of 2 mg/ml with 2⫻ sds-page loading
buffer (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). samples were
boiled for 6 min. sample protein (6 ␮g/lane) was
separated on 8 –16% polyacrylamide minigels (invitrogen). proteins separated by electrophoresis
were transferred to immobilon-pvdf membranes
(millipore, bedford, ma) using a semi-dry apparatus
(bio-rad, hercules, ca). nonspeciﬁc binding to
membranes was prevented by blocking for 60 min at
rt in tbs solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk.
membranes were then probed by overnight incubation with 1:500 dilution of gfap antibody (rdi,
flanders, nj), and 1:100 dilution of  xxxg2150xxx  antibody
(calbiochem), then membranes were rinsed three
times with tbs, then incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody in tbs solution containing 0.25% nonfat dry
milk for 90 min at rt. after washing three more
times, antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using a kit from pierce biotechnology.
measurement of 5-ht and  xxxg2150xxx  binding
125

[ i]rti-55 (3␤-(4⬘-iodophenyl)tropan-2␤-carboxylic
acid methyl ester) was used to label  xxxg2150xxx  binding sites
using previously published methods (rothman et al.,
1994). binding surfaces (rothman, 1986) were generated by displacing two concentrations of [125i]rti-55
(0.02 and 1.01 nm) by eight concentrations of rti-55 in
the presence of 100 nm gbr12935 or 100 nm 4-(2benzhydryloxyethyl)-1-(4-nitrobenzyl)-piperidine oxalate (tp-2-64) (with similar results) to block binding
to the  xxxg2149xxx , and 100 nm desipramine
to block binding to the  xxxg1505xxx   xxxg2148xxx .
tp-2-64 is a gbr12935 analog that is more selective
for the  xxxg2149xxx  than gbr12935 (prisinzano et
al., submitted). nonspeciﬁc binding was determined
using 10 ␮m gbr12909. the reaction was terminated
after an 18 –24 h incubation at 4°c by rapid ﬁltration
over whatman gf/b ﬁlters.
rat cortical tissue levels of da, dopac, ne, and
hva, 5-ht, and 5-hiaa were measured using highpressure chromatography coupled with electrochemical
detection as previously described (baumann et al.,
1998).

data analysis, statistics, and reagents
the [125i]rti-55 binding surfaces of six rats were
pooled and ﬁt to a one-site binding model using
mlab-pc (civilized software, bethesda, md), for the
best-ﬁt estimates of the bmax and kd as described in
detail elsewhere (rothman, 1986). statistical signiﬁcance among binding parameters was determined using the f-test. western blots were quantitated using
standard methods (jayanthi et al., 2002). statistical
signiﬁcance of the 5-ht tissue data and the western
blot data was determined by anova with a post-hoc
newman-keul’s test. the sources of reagents used in
this study are described in previous publications as
cited in the previous sections. tp-2-64 was synthesized
in the laboratory of dr. kenner c. rice, lmc, niddk,
nih (greiner et al., 2003).
results
d-fen and pca treatment decreased the bmax of the
 xxxg2150xxx  between 30% and 60%, depending on the tissue
and time after drug administration (table i). similarly,
d-fen and pca administration profoundly decreased
tissue 5-ht and 5-hiaa in frontal cortex (fig. 1). ne,
dopac, da, and hva were not affected (data not
shown).
using the chemicon  xxxg2150xxx  antibody, western blot
analysis permitted reliable detection of the  xxxg2150xxx  protein at 76 kda (fig. 2, upper panel). samples from all
six groups were run on the same gel. in the 2-week
treatment group, an additional band of ⬃78 kda was
observed. despite the large decreases in  xxxg2150xxx  binding
and 5-ht levels that occurred with d-fen administration,  xxxg2150xxx  protein expression, as determined by western blot analysis, did not change in either tissue or
time point (fig. 2, lower panel). unexpectedly, pca
administration decreased  xxxg2150xxx  protein only at the
2-day point in the caudate.
to conﬁrm the ﬁndings made with the chemicon
antibody, whole rat brain minus caudate from the
2-week group was probed with  xxxg2150xxx  antibody obtained from calbiochem. the same samples were also
probed for gfap. figure 3 demonstrates that the calbiochem antibody afforded reliable detection of the
 xxxg2150xxx  protein at 70 kda. figure 4 reports that treatment with d-fen and pca did not decrease  xxxg2150xxx 
protein expression in whole brain minus caudate in the
2-week group. these results conﬁrm the ﬁndings obtained with the chemicon  xxxg2150xxx  antibody. there was
also no change in gfap expression (fig. 5).
discussion
it is well established that administration of highdose fen, d-fen, or pca to rats results in longlasting decreases in markers of serotonergic nerves,
including 5-ht, tryptophan hydroxylase, and the
 xxxg2150xxx  (huether et al., 1997; mccann et al., 1997).

fig. 4. samples prepared from control, d-fen-, and pca-treated
animals (2-week group) were probed with  xxxg2150xxx  antibody obtained
from calbiochem and quantitated as described in materials and
methods. each sample was compared to a corresponding control. each
value is the mean ⫾ sd (n ⫽ 3).

immunohistochemical studies, typically detecting
5-ht, provide images consistent with the hypothesis
that fen and pca administration produce axonal degeneration and an ensuing loss of presynaptic nerve
terminals (mamounas et al., 1995; molliver and molliver, 1990).
 xxxg2150xxx  proteins are rapidly sequestered in response to
various perturbations such as phosphorylation (bauman et al., 2000; blakely and bauman, 2000; ramamoorthy and blakely, 1999). as with other biogenic
amine transporters,  xxxg2150xxx  is subject to protein trafﬁcking (blakely and bauman, 2000). thus, serts in a
nerve terminal likely exist in two pools: sequestered
and unsequestered. an alternative interpretation of
the 5-ht neurotoxicity data (mccann et al., 1997) is
that high-dose fen/d-fen produces a long-lasting
shift in the balance between sequestered and unsequestered  xxxg2150xxx  so that a greater proportion of  xxxg2150xxx 
is sequestered, leading to a decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  binding.
the apparent loss of 5-ht nerve terminals as detected
by immunohistochemical measurement of 5-ht would
be explained by a decrease in presynaptic 5-ht levels
to below the detectable level. one prediction of this
alternative hypothesis is that high-dose fen/d-fen
will decrease  xxxg2150xxx  binding without a corresponding
decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  immunoreactive protein measured

by western blot. whereas ligand binding methods will
not detect internalized transporters, western blot will
measure all  xxxg2150xxx  protein because of the denaturing
conditions used in the assay.
the data of the present study are in accord with the
alternative hypothesis. as expected, d-fen administration decreased  xxxg2150xxx  binding and 5-ht tissue levels
by about 30 – 60% in both tissues and at both time
points. because our experimental design emphasized
performing different types of measurements in the
same rat, we measured tissue 5-ht only in the prefrontal cortex. this was done to verify that d-fen and pca
had decreased tissue 5-ht in the same rats in which
we conducted [125i]rti-55 binding and western blot
measurements. this experimental design precluded
measuring tissue 5-ht in the same tissue used for the
binding and western blot measurements. however,
previous studies indicate that d-fen and pca treatments reduce tissue 5-ht similarly across brain regions (baumann et al., 1998, 2000; dewar et al., 1992;
fasciano et al., 1997; zaczek et al., 1990). thus, it is
reasonable to assume that d-fen and pca decreased
tissue 5-ht in caudate and whole brain minus caudate.
d-fen did not decrease  xxxg2150xxx  protein levels in either
tissue or at either time point. to verify our ﬁndings, we
repeated  xxxg2150xxx  westerns using whole brain minus cau-

date from the same 2-week group and observed, using
a second, different  xxxg2150xxx  antibody (figs. 4, 5), identical
results, i.e., no change in  xxxg2150xxx  protein expression. as
reported by others (haring et al., 1992; huether et al.,
1997; mamounas et al., 1995; ridet et al., 1994; zhou et
al., 1996), pca reduced  xxxg2150xxx  binding at all time
points and in both tissues, but reduced  xxxg2150xxx  protein
only at the 2- xxxd1861xxx  point.
most studies that have examined the effect of fen/
d-fen or pca administration on the  xxxg2150xxx  used radioligand binding to measure  xxxg2150xxx  (appel et al., 1990;
zaczek et al., 1990). this is an indirect method and
may not be able to detect internalized transporters.
western blots, in contrast, which use denatured homogenates, will measure all  xxxg2150xxx  protein present in a
sample. clearly, the results obtained with western
blots were unexpected. since d-fen administration
failed to decrease  xxxg2150xxx  protein, yet decreased  xxxg2150xxx 
binding, the simplest explanation of the data is that
d-fen administration leads to functional inactivation
of  xxxg2150xxx , not serotonergic axotomy (molliver and molliver, 1990). although  xxxg2150xxx  sequestration is one explanation of our ﬁndings, other possibilities should be
considered. as with d-fen, the results obtained with
pca were also unexpected and also suggest that pca
administration leads to  xxxg2150xxx  sequestration, not serotonergic axotomy. the lack of change in gfap expression supports this hypothesis.
in conclusion, d-fen and pca administration decreases 5-ht and [125i]rti-55 binding to the  xxxg2150xxx ,
but not  xxxg2150xxx  protein expression, suggesting that dfen and pca may not promote the loss of presynaptic
5-ht nerve terminals. these data suggest that the
putative serotonergic toxicity of substituted amphetamines should be reexamined using immunological
methods to quantify  xxxg2150xxx  protein, rather than  xxxg2150xxx 
binding.
