microsporidia are parasitic protists of all classes of vertebrates and most invertebrates. they recently
emerged as important infections in various immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patient populations.
they are also important veterinary and agricultural pathogens. current therapies for microsporidiosis include
benzimidazoles, which bind tubulin-inhibiting microtubule assembly, and  xxxd2166xxx  and its derivatives, which
bind and inhibit methionine amino peptidase type 2 ( xxxg1400xxx ). benzimidazoles are not active against enterocytozoon bieneusi, the most common cause of human microsporidiosis.  xxxd2166xxx  is active against most
microsporidia, including e. bieneusi, but thrombocytopenia has been a problem in clinical trials. there is a
pressing need for more-specific microsporidian  xxxg1400xxx  inhibitors. to expedite and facilitate the discovery of
safe and effective  xxxg1400xxx  inhibitors, we have engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae to be dependent on encephalitozoon cuniculi  xxxg1400xxx  (ecmetap2) for its growth, where ecmetap2 is harbored on an episomal uracilselectable tetracycline-regulated plasmid. we have also constructed a leucine-selectable tetracycline-regulated
expression plasmid into which any  xxxg1400xxx  gene can be cloned. by utilizing a 5-fluoroorotic acid-mediated
plasmid shuffle in the ecmetap2 yeast strain, a yeast strain can be generated whose growth is dependent on
 xxxg1400xxx  from any organism. the level of heterologous  xxxg1400xxx  gene expression can be controlled by the
addition of tetracycline to the growth medium. these yeast strains should permit high-throughput screening
for the identification of new inhibitors with high specificity and activity toward microsporidian  xxxg1400xxx .
semisynthetic analogue of  xxxd2166xxx  that appears to be less
toxic but has been reported to exhibit side effects in wound
healing and female reproduction (15). clinical trials with tnp470 as an angiogenesis inhibitor suggest that resistance to
 xxxd1330xxx  can occur (2).
 xxxd2800xxx  (5),  xxxd2166xxx , and derivatives such as  xxxd1330xxx 
(23), cis- xxxd2166xxx  (21), and fumagalone (35) specifically and
covalently bind to a target enzyme identified as methionine
amino peptidase type 2 ( xxxg1400xxx  [map2 in yeast]) and specifically inhibit its peptidase activity.  xxxg1400xxx  catalyzes an essential posttranslational modification of nascent proteins by
cleaving the initiator methionine and thus is a major component of the n-terminal methionine excision pathway (15).
n-terminal methionine excision has been found to be an
essential universal process conserved from eubacteria to
higher eukaryotes.  xxxg1400xxx  genes are essential genes in all
prokaryotes since  xxxg1400xxx  deletion is lethal. there are two
major forms of metaps, designated type 1 and type 2 (1,
22). although not an absolute rule, prokaryotes, which include eubacteria and archaebacteria, will typically express
the  xxxg1399xxx  isoform, while eukaryotes express both type 1
and type 2 isoforms. additionally, there are reports of other
forms of metaps (16, 27).  xxxg1400xxx  gained a lot of attention
recently as an excellent therapeutic target not only in treatment of various parasite infections but also in anticancer
therapy (26). data suggest that the cellular target for  xxxd2166xxx  and its analogs in microsporidia is a microsporidian
 xxxg1400xxx  homologue and that this is an essential enzyme for
these organisms (34).
 xxxd2166xxx  and its analogs do not bind or inhibit the activity
of  xxxg1399xxx  or other amino peptidases. saccharomyces cerevisiae cells deficient in  xxxg1399xxx  (⌬map1) are killed by  xxxd2800xxx ,

microsporidia are “emerging” human and veterinary pathogens. these protists belong to the phylum microsporidia, which
are obligate intracellular parasites. they are ubiquitous in nature, having been described as parasites of all classes of vertebrates and most invertebrates (8, 33). they have been reported
to infect mainly their host’s digestive tract; however, infections
have also been reported in reproductive, muscle, excretory,
and nervous systems (4, 7, 10, 11, 30, 31). microsporidia have
been identified in water sources as well as in wild, domestic,
and farm animals. this has raised concerns for waterborne,
food-borne, and zoonotic transmissions of these infections. at
least 10 species have been etiologic in several disease syndromes in humans (32). these pathogens have presented as
opportunistic infections in immunodeficient hosts, such as patients with aids and/or organ transplantation, but also infect
immunocompetent hosts (9). the two most commonly used
drugs for treating microsporidiosis in animals and humans are
albendazole and  xxxd2166xxx  (6). albendazole is a benzimidazole that inhibits tubulin polymerization. even though it is
effective against many microsporidia, including encephalitozoon spp., which infect mammals, including humans, it is only
variably effective against enterocytozoon bieneusi, the most
common cause of human microsporidiosis.
 xxxd2166xxx  is a sesquiterpene diepoxide produced by the
fungus aspergillus fumigatus and is highly effective when administered systemically to humans but has caused neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia in some patients (24).  xxxd1330xxx  is a

materials and methods
strains, growth conditions, and dna methods. all s. cerevisiae strains used
and generated in the present study are derived from s228c (atcc 201388), with
the genotype mata his3⌬1 leu2⌬0 met15⌬0 ura3⌬0. yeast was grown at 30°c on
yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (ypd) solid or liquid medium and synthetic
complete (sc) liquid or solid medium. ypd- xxxg418xxx  plates contained ypd medium with 200 ␮g/ml of  xxxg418xxx  (life technologies, gaithersburg, md). escherichia coli strain top10 and standard media and methods were used for plasmid
manipulations. yeast genomic dna was isolated using a yeast star genomic
dna kit from zymo research (zymo research, orange, ca). plasmid dna
was isolated from e. coli and from agarose gels using qiagen kits (qiagen,
santa clarita, ca). oligonucleotides were purchased from invitrogen (carlsbad,
ca). dna for plasmid construction and yeast transformation was generated by
pcr using the expand system (boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in) for 30
cycles.

plasmids and vector construction. the ecmetap2 gene was pcr amplified
from a pcr2.1-topo vector containing the ecmetap2 gene, (34) using primers
ecmap2pmefor (5⬘ccgtttaaacagatgaagtgtattctgttgaatca
ggctgaggagc3⬘) and ecmap2 eagrev (5⬘ gaatcggccgttaatagt
catcgccccttgtaag3⬘) (restriction sites are underlined). the 1.1-kb pcr
product was cloned into the yeast episomal vector pcm190 at the pmei and eagi
sites to generate the plasmid pcm190:ecmetap2. ligation of the pcr product
was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing to confirm the
absence of pcr-generated mutations in the vector construct. to construct plasmid prs425tet, plasmid pcm190 was cut with hindiii, followed by end blunting
with klenow. ecori treatment of this product yielded a 2,822-bp fragment
containing the elements required for tetracycline-dependent transcription in
yeast. this fragment was initially cloned into prs423 at blunt-ended noti and
ecori sites to generate prs423tet. the 3.3-kb pvuii fragment from prs423tet
was then excised and ligated into prs425 at the pvuii site, resulting in the
plasmid prs425tet.
mutant ecmetap2 was pcr amplified from the vector pvl1392:mutecmetap2 (34), using the same primers as described above for the amplification of the
wild-type ecmetap2 gene. a 1.1-kb pcr product was digested with pmei and
eagi and was ligated into pmei/eagi-digested prs425tet. positive clones
(prs425tet::mutecmetap2) were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing.
human  xxxg1400xxx  was pcr amplified using a human cdna library as the
template, employing the primer set humap2pmefor (ccgtttaaacagatg
gcgggtgtggaggaggtagc) and humap2eagrev (gaatcggccgt
taatagtcatctcctctgctgacaac) (restriction sites are underlined).
the 1.5-kb pcr product was ligated at the pmei and eagi sites of prs425tet,
generating prs425tet:humetap2.
pcr-mediated deletion of yeast map2 using a his3mx6 disruption cassette.
a 1.6-kb pcr product of his3mx6 marker flanked by 60 nucleotides homologous to the region immediately upstream and downstream of the start and stop
codons, respectively, of the yeast map2 gene locus was generated using the
primers map2hisfor (5⬘gaagctaataagtgggcttttacatcaacaag
tactgtagaagctctaccgtattgaaaaggcgcgccacttctaaataagcgaatttc3⬘)
and map2hisrev (5⬘atataactacaacagtattcatatacctagtg
aggaggccatttgaaagcgcattttaccgatctgatatcatcgatgaattcgagctcg3⬘)
(letters in lowercase are homologous to the plasmid sequence), using pym2
plasmid (20) as the template. the pcr product was gel purified, and 5 ␮g of the
product was used for transforming the by4741 map1::kan mata yeast strain
(atcc 4005153) containing pcm190:ecmetap2 plasmid by using the lithium
acetate transformation procedure (14). transformants were then selected on an
sc-histidine (sc-his) plate.
genomic dna was prepared and used as the template for the diagnostic
pcrs, using the primers map2for (p1) (5⬘caagggacctttaatgacct
ggtctc3⬘), map2rev (p2) (5⬘tgcagcacaatggttgagagagag
3⬘), and map2hisrev (p3) (5⬘cttaacttcgcatctgggcagatgatg
tcg3⬘).
immunoblot analysis. yeast cells were harvested around an optical density at
600 nm of 2.0 and washed in cold water, and cell lysates were prepared by glass
bead disruption. total protein was estimated using bio-rad protein reagent, and
50 ␮g of total protein was loaded per lane in a 10% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  gel.
resolved proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose and incubated with a
1:2,000 dilution of anti-recombinant ecmetap2 (anti-recmetap2) or antihumetap2 antibody overnight at 4°c. immune complexes were visualized by
incubation of the immunoblots with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin g, followed by chemiluminiscence detection (ge healthcare biosciences, piscataway, nj).
yeast drug assay. yeast colonies were inoculated onto ypd liquid medium
and grown at 30°c with shaking. at an a600 reading of 1.5, yeast cells were
diluted to 0.5 absorbance units and were then 10-fold serially diluted. using a
multichannel pipettor, 3 ␮l of the yeast cell suspension was spotted onto solid
ypd medium in the absence of any drugs or onto the plates containing either 10
␮g/ml of doxycycline or different concentrations of  xxxd2800xxx ,  xxxd2166xxx , or tnp470. the plates were incubated at 30°c for 5 to 6 days and photographed.

but yeast cells deficient in  xxxg1400xxx  (⌬map2) are not (17, 29).
deletion of both  xxxg1399xxx  and  xxxg1400xxx  is lethal in yeast (17,
34). these data confirm that  xxxd2166xxx  selectively targets
 xxxg1400xxx  and not  xxxg1399xxx . the genome of the microsporidian
encephalitozoon cuniculi lacks  xxxg1399xxx  (19, 25); therefore, in
microsporidia, inhibition of  xxxg1400xxx  by  xxxd2166xxx  most likely
results in cell death analogous to the situation in ⌬map1 yeast.
this indicates that microsporidian  xxxg1400xxx  is a physiologically
relevant target for parasite drug development. although the
therapeutic potentials of  xxxg1400xxx  have increasingly been recognized, there are only a few inhibitors against metaps reported in the literature.
screening for potent novel inhibitors of the enzyme  xxxg1400xxx 
can conventionally be accomplished either by using the recombinant protein of the pathogen or by using in vitro cell culture
of the parasite. the use of the recombinant enzyme is not ideal
since it involves tedious heterologous expression, isolation, and
purification procedures and an in vitro inhibitory assay may not
reflect the true physiological conditions of the protein. in addition, since the enzyme requires metal ion for its activity,
conversion of the recombinant apoenzyme to its corresponding
active holoenzyme adds an additional complication. the use of
an in vitro microsporidian culture for identifying the inhibitors
of microsporidian  xxxg1400xxx  is cumbersome and time consuming. in addition, this approach is impossible for those microsporidia which are noncultivatable and for which there is no
murine model of infection, such as e. bieneusi. as an alternative to the above-described methods, yeast-based screening
strategies are attractive as they are simple and rapid and can be
carried out in a high-throughput manner. they have successfully been used for studying drugs effective against protein
targets of apicomplexa (28) and for identifying the inhibitors of
 xxxg631xxx  of mycobacterium tuberculosis (13) and
cryptosporidium parvum (3). one of the main prerequisites
required for conducting such studies is that parasite target
protein needs to be able to complement its ortholog protein
function in yeast.
we have reported the identification and characterization of
the  xxxg1400xxx  gene and its protein product from the humanpathogenic microsporidian e. cuniculi (34). in an attempt to
design a simple and rapid approach to screen for novel e.
cuniculi  xxxg1400xxx  (ecmetap2) inhibitors, we devised a complementary approach which is independent of recombinant
protein or parasite culture and instead dependent on the expression of ecmetap2 in the yeast s. cerevisiae.

and 53% similarity. ecmetap2 was pcr amplified and cloned
into a 2-␮m yeast expression plasmid, pcm 190, to generate
pcm190:ecmetap2. a ⌬map1 yeast strain (atcc 4005153)
was transformed with pcm190 and pcm190:ecmetap2 vectors. transformants were selected on sc-uracil (sc-ura)
plates. independent colonies from both of the plates were
inoculated into sc-ura medium for growth. cell lysates
were subjected to immunoblot analysis to investigate whether
ecmetap2 protein was expressed in yeast, using mouse polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant ecmetap2 (34).
a minimum of four colonies was examined for each transformation, and a representative figure is shown in fig. 1. a
specific signal corresponding to the predicted size of the
ecmetap2 protein is seen in the lysates of the yeast transformed with the pcm190:ecmetap2 vector (fig. 1, lane 2),
and this signal is absent in lysates from yeast transformed with
an empty pcm190 vector (lane 1), indicating that ecmetap2
expresses in yeast from the teto- xxxg568xxx  hybrid promoter in the
vector pcm190.
in order to determine whether ecmetap2 complements the
function of map2 in yeast, we employed a one-step pcrmediated gene disruption of the endogenous yeast map2 gene
in the strains harboring pcm190:ecmetap2. a histidine-selectable marker cassette was pcr amplified using primers with
homologous sequences flanking the start and the stop codon of
the yeast map2 gene, using pym2 as a template (20). this
pcr product was transformed to the yeast strains which contain either pcm190 (control) or pcm190:ecmetap2 (test)
vector, and the transformants were selected on sc-his plates.
his- and ura-positive transformants from the control and test
plates were then replica plated onto a 5-fluoroorotic acid (5foa) plate. while almost all of the colonies from the control
plate grew in the presence of 5-foa, more than 50% of the
transformants from the test plate exhibited an inability to grow
in the presence of 5-foa. in the next experiment, two of the
independent his/ura-positive colonies from the test plate were
serially diluted and spotted onto ypd plates containing doxy-

 xxxd2900xxx . a representative clone is shown in fig. 2, illustrating
the regulation of gene expression by doxycycline in yeast with
a disrupted endogenous map2 locus which is now dependent
on ecmetap2 under the control of the teto- xxxg568xxx  hybrid
promoter. to further confirm the deletion of the genomic
map2 gene, genomic dna was isolated from these cells and
used as a template in a diagnostic pcr. pcr was carried out
using three primers designed as shown in fig. 3a. primer p1

was designed to anneal to the yeast map2 gene locus outside
the region of alteration, primer p2 to anneal in the map2 gene
locus, and primer p3 to anneal to the hismx6 region in the
transformation module. in the cells where the map2 gene is
intact, a pcr product of 650 bp was obtained as predicted
(fig. 3b, lanes 2 and 3), and in the cells where there is a
replacement of the yeast map2 gene by a histidine marker, a
pcr product of 1,650 bp was obtained as expected (fig. 3b,
lane 4).
evaluation of 5-foa-mediated plasmid shuffle to convert
ecmetap2-dependent yeast to a strain dependent on humetap2.
since the  xxxg1400xxx  gene has been reported to be a therapeutic
target for a wide range of infectious agents, we wanted to extend
the present system to be useful for screening novel inhibitors for
 xxxg1400xxx  from other organisms. to achieve this, prs425tet, an
episomal leucine (leu) marker-containing plasmid, was constructed with the same basic elements required for the tetracycline-dependent expression of a foreign gene as pcm190. as
human  xxxg1400xxx  (humetap2) has been reported to complement
yeast map2 function (12), this gene was selected to test this
plasmid shuffle vector. the humetap2 gene was cloned into
the pmei/eagi sites of prs425tet to generate prs425tet:
humetap2. this plasmid was initially transformed to a ⌬map1
yeast strain, and the transformants were selected on sc-leu
plates. after the initial colony purification, individual colony
lysates were used for the immunoblot analysis employing antihumetap2. as shown in fig. 4 there is a specific signal in lane
1 corresponding to the predicted size of the human  xxxg1400xxx 
protein which is absent in the lysate from the cells transformed
with vector alone (prs425tet), confirming the expression of
humetap2 in yeast.
to demonstrate the complementation of yeast map2 by
humetap2, a plasmid reshuffle was carried out in the ⌬map1
map2 pcm190:ecmetap2 strain to replace pcm190:
ecmetap2 plasmid with prs425tet:humetap2. the ⌬map1

map2 pcm190:ecmetap2 strain was transformed with
prs425tet (control) or prs425tet:humetap2 (test) plasmid, and the transformants were selected on sc-leu plates.
leu-positive colonies were streaked after colony purification
on sc–5-foa-containing ura plates for facilitating the ejection of ura-containing plasmid causing the loss of ecmetap2.
there was a significant number of colonies in the plate
streaked with the cells transformed with test plasmid, indicating that humetap2 is the only copy of the  xxxg1400xxx  gene in
these cells and that it complements yeast map2 function. there
were no colonies in the plate spread with the cells transformed
with control plasmid, confirming our earlier observation that in
the absence of a copy of humetap2, cells require ecmetap2
activity for survival. when prs425tet:humetap2-containing
cells were spotted after a 10-fold serial dilution on ypd plates
containing doxycycline, they also exhibited doxycycline sensitivity
(fig. 2), consistent with the phenotype observed earlier for
ecmetap2-containing cells. this experiment demonstrates the
generation of ⌬map1 map2 prs425tet:humetap2 yeast cells
starting from ⌬map1 map2 pcm190:ecmetap2 and suggests
that the  xxxg1400xxx  gene from any organism can be used for
plasmid reshuffle to generate a new yeast strain dependent on
that organism’s  xxxg1400xxx  (provided that the organism’s
 xxxg1400xxx  can complement the function of endogenous map2 in
yeast).
a point mutation in ecmetap2 abolished its ability to complement yeast  xxxg1400xxx . site-directed mutagenesis of ecmetap2 was
performed using a quikchange ii site-directed mutagenesis
kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca), changing the residue ala to thr
at position 241 in ecmetap2 (this ala corresponds to the ala
at position 362 in humetap2) (34). both the wild-type and the
mutant proteins were expressed in sf9 insect cells, employing the
bakpak baculovirus expression system as previously described
(34). independent in vitro enzymatic assays were done using methionine–para-nitroanilide and met–pro–p-nitroanilide as substrates and confirmed that both of these enzyme preparations
exhibited comparable in vitro enzyme activities (data not
shown). the ecmetap2-thr241 mutant gene was cloned into

strain was transformed with this plasmid, the transformants
were selected on sc-leu plates, and the positive transformants
were used for the immunoblot analysis with anti-recmetap2.
as demonstrated in fig. 5 there was expression of both
ecmetap2 (lane 1) and mutecmetap2 (lane 3) in transformed cells and no expression in cells transformed with empty
prs425tet vector (lane 2). despite multiple attempts, we were
unable to replace the pcm190:ecmetap2 plasmid with
prs425tet:mutecmetap2 following 5-foa-mediated selection.
in all of the experiments, no colonies grew in the presence of
5-foa, suggesting that mutecmetap2 does not complement
yeast map2.
validation of a drug screening strategy for ecmetap2 and
humetap2 by using the newly generated yeast strains. for
validation of the use of these newly generated yeast strains as
a screen for potential  xxxg1400xxx  inhibitors, we used  xxxd2166xxx ,
 xxxd2800xxx , and  xxxd1330xxx , which are known inhibitors of  xxxg1400xxx .
after pilot experiments to determine the optimum concentrations of each drug, each yeast strain was spotted after 10-fold
serial dilutions on ypd agar plates containing the appropriate
amount of drug and the plates were incubated at 30°c. as
shown in fig. 6  xxxd2166xxx  at 1 and 5 nm inhibited  xxxg1400xxx 
from all three sources, i.e., yeast, e. cuniculi, and human;
however, yeast map2 was more resistant to  xxxd2166xxx  than
both e. cuniculi  xxxg1400xxx  and humetap2. we have observed
that higher concentrations of the drugs were required to inhibit
yeast map2, resulting in growth arrest (data not shown).  xxxd2800xxx  was more effective than  xxxd2166xxx . for  xxxd2800xxx , 0.5 to 1
nm of the drug was inhibitory for all three metap2s. for
 xxxd1330xxx , 0.25 ␮m of the drug was used and all of the
metap2s were less sensitive than to  xxxd2166xxx  or  xxxd2800xxx .

discussion
a main goal of the present study was to develop a new
strategy to identify potent inhibitors of microsporidian
 xxxg1400xxx . to accomplish this, using yeast as a surrogate system,
the primary criterion was to determine whether microsporidian
 xxxg1400xxx  complements map2 function in yeast. it had already
been shown that human  xxxg1400xxx  complements yeast map2
function only when overexpressed from a 2-␮m episomal plasmid. when human  xxxg1400xxx  was cloned into a centromerecontaining yeast expression plasmid, it failed to support the
viability of ⌬map1 map2 yeast cells, suggesting that the amount
of humetap2 protein expressed from a single-copy centromere plasmid may not be sufficient to sustain yeast growth
(12). overexpression of a heterologous protein may, however,
force nonspecific protein-protein interactions titrating out a
specific protein from its biologically relevant association with
another protein, resulting in a lethal phenotype. systematic
characterization of proteins associated with either yeast map1
or map2 have not been reported; however, genome-wide affinity purification-based protein interaction network studies of
yeast have identified a physical interaction of map2 with an
essential dna binding protein, rfc3p ( xxxg220xxx  of heteropentameric replication factor c) (18). overexpression of a heterologous  xxxg1400xxx  protein may result in its increased association
with rfc3p, making this protein unavailable for dna replication and leading to cell death and the conclusion that the
heterologous protein is nonfunctional in yeast. therefore,
pcm190, a 2-␮m-based yeast expression plasmid in which the
expression of the foreign gene can be modulated using tetracycline derivatives, was utilized for these studies.

strategy and is consistent with earlier reports of yeast map2
complementation by humetap2.
in the case of humetap2, it has been reported that a point
mutation resulting in the change of a single amino acid at
position 362 from ala to thr abolishes its sensitivity to  xxxd2800xxx . this study was carried out to screen for  xxxd2800xxx -resistant
humetap2 after random mutagenesis using a yeast system (2),
and the exact mechanism of a362t-mediated resistance of
humetap2 to  xxxd2800xxx  is not clear. we wondered whether
ecmetap2 would exhibit properties similar to those of  xxxd2800xxx 
and thus would be useful for validating  xxxd2800xxx  drug assays.
we, therefore, mutated the ala at 241 of ecmetap2 to threonine and successfully expressed this mutant protein in a baculovirus system. the in vitro enzyme activity of the mutant protein
was comparable to that of the wild-type protein. despite this,
mutecmetap2 failed to complement the function of map2 in
yeast. this may be because this mutation interferes with biologically relevant potential protein-protein interactions in
yeast. this suggests that in addition to the peptidase activity,
yeast map2 may also participate in other important functions
required for yeast growth and mutecmetap2 may not be able
to complement such functions. this may not be surprising
given the fact that in yeast, map1 point mutations in the zinc
finger region exhibited a more detrimental effect on the enzyme function in vivo than did truncation of the entire zinc
finger domain (12).
we validated our strategy of using the yeast strains generated in the present study for drug screening by using known
inhibitors of  xxxg1400xxx . serial dilution and spotting of yeast
strains dependent on  xxxg1400xxx  of yeast, e. cuniculi, and human
on plates containing  xxxd2166xxx ,  xxxd2800xxx , and  xxxd1330xxx  are
clearly consistent with in vitro data for e. cuniculi showing that
these drugs are inhibitory to this organism. in our assays for all
of the drugs tested, human  xxxg1400xxx  was more sensitive to
these agents than either ecmetap2 or yeast map2. this may
be due to our observation that ecmetap2 complements yeast
map2 function more efficiently than human  xxxg1400xxx . the doubling time of a yeast ⌬map1 map2 strain dependent on
ecmetap2 was 3.5 to 4 h compared to 7.5 to 8 h for a yeast
⌬map1 map2 strain dependent on humetap2. we have observed that the yeast strains exhibited a higher sensitivity toward all of the drug concentrations tested than toward the drug
concentrations found optimal by brdlik and crews (2). this
may be because of a difference in the parental yeast strains
used by brdlik and crews (2) as well as a difference in the
compositions of media used for our respective drug assays. the
higher concentration of  xxxd1330xxx  required in the present study
to inhibit  xxxg1400xxx  activities and thereby the growth of yeast
cells is consistent with the reported observation that  xxxd1330xxx 
is less potent in arresting the growth of s. cerevisiae cells (2).
the strategy of generating new yeast strains dependent on
 xxxg1400xxx  of an organism of choice and the demonstration of
their use for high-throughput drug screening should prove to
be very useful for developing new inhibitors for  xxxg1400xxx . once
novel inhibitors are identified in screens using these yeast
strains dependent on heterologous  xxxg1400xxx , yeast cells can be
grown in liquid culture to determine their respective 50%
inhibitory concentration values against a parasite’s  xxxg1400xxx . in
addition, random mutagenesis studies can be carried out with
various metap2s from different sources with yeast to identify

genomic map1 is replaced by a kanmx4 cassette, rendering
the cells  xxxg418xxx  positive. the absence of the map1 gene in this
strain was reconfirmed by diagnostic pcr using gene-specific
primers. transformation of this strain with pcm190:ecmetap2
vector and subsequent immunoblot analysis clearly established
that ecmetap2 can be expressed in yeast. in the next step,
three independent approaches were employed to ascertain the
complementation of yeast map2 function by ecmetap2 protein. we hypothesized that if ecmetap2 complements the
function, we should be able to delete the endogenous chromosomal copy of the yeast map2 gene. a histidine-selectable
marker cassette was used for the disruption of the yeast map2
gene by a one-step pcr-mediated gene deletion strategy.
transformation of yeast cells containing either pcm190 (control plate) or pcm190:ecmetap2 (test plate) vector resulted
in the appearance of a significant number of colonies in sc-his
plates, which represent cells in which the transformation module is recombined either at the target map2 gene locus or
elsewhere in the genome. to facilitate screening for those cells
in which homologous recombination has occurred at the map2
locus, we employed 5-foa selection. when his- and urapositive transformants from the test plate are selected on
plates containing 5-foa, only those cells which possess the
intact endogenous copy of yeast map2 will grow. those cells in
which the recombination of the histidine marker module has
occurred at the genomic map2 locus will not be able to survive
because in the presence of 5-foa, yeast cells will lose uracontaining plasmid which harbors the ecmetap2 gene. consistent with this, all of the colonies from the control plate
survived in the presence of 5-foa and a significant number of
colonies from the test plate failed to grow in the presence of
5-foa.
in the vector pcm190:ecmetap2, the expression of
ecmetap2 is under the regulation of doxycycline. in the
⌬map1 map2 yeast transformants, the only source of map2
activity is ecmetap2. in these cells, if ecmetap2 complements the function of yeast map2, then their growth should be
modulated by doxycycline. accordingly, we found that 5-foasensitive colonies from the test plate had a clear sensitivity
toward doxycyline, confirming that in these cells, the genomic
yeast map2 locus has been replaced by a his-selectable
marker cassette (fig. 2). the final demonstration of the
genomic yeast map2 deletion in the presence of ecmetap2
was provided by a diagnostic pcr of yeast genomic dna. all
of these independent experimental results conclusively suggest
that we have generated a ⌬map1 map2 yeast strain which is
dependent on ecmetap2 for its viability. these yeast strains
exhibited growth rates similar to that of their parental ⌬map1
yeast strain.
since several species of microsporidia have caused human
infections, we wanted to extend our study to facilitate the
generation of yeast strains whose growth is dependent on the
functional expression of  xxxg1400xxx  from any organism of choice.
to this end, we generated the prs425tet vector. using the
two vectors pcm190 and prs425tet with ura and leu markers, respectively, one can generate a yeast strain containing the
 xxxg1400xxx  of any organism by employing a 5-foa-mediated
plasmid shuffle. using these vectors, we demonstrated the conversion of a yeast strain dependent on ecmetap2 to one dependent on human  xxxg1400xxx  for its growth. this validates our

overall, the technique we have described should prove to be
very useful for the development of new therapeutic agents
against microsporidia as well as other pathogenic organisms.
