background. during some surgical interventions,
temporary occlusion of the hepatic blood supply may
cause ischemia-reperfusion (ir) injury. recent studies
suggest that type 3 phosphodiesterase inhibitors may
have a beneficial effect on liver ir injury. the aim of
this study was to investigate whether  xxxd2341xxx , a type
3 phosphodiesterase inhibitor, could have a protective
effect on liver having experimental liver ir injury.
materials and methods. sixty wistar albino rats
were randomly divided into three groups. the ir and
 xxxd2341xxx  groups were subjected to 1 h total hepatic
ischemia, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. the sham
group underwent midline laparotomy only.  xxxd2341xxx 
10 ␮g/kg/min was infused to the  xxxd2341xxx  group during the 3 h of the ir period. histopathological examination, biochemical liver function, and liver  xxxd83xxx  concentration after reperfusion and
survival rate on the seventh day after the ir insult
were recorded.
results. serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase levels, and
histological damage scores in the  xxxd2341xxx  and ir
groups were significantly higher compared with the
sham group (p < 0.01). however, all of these values
were significantly lower in the  xxxd2341xxx  group than
in the ir group (p < 0.05). liver  xxxd83xxx  levels and the rat survival rate in the  xxxd2341xxx 
and ir groups were significantly lower than those in
the sham group (p < 0.01). however, these values were
significantly higher in the  xxxd2341xxx  group compared
to those in the ir group (p < 0.01).
conclusions. these results suggest that  xxxd2341xxx 
plays a significant role in the protection of liver

introduction

the pringle maneuver— clamping of the portal
pedicle—is commonly used to interrupt blood flow to
the liver during surgery. tissue damage occurs during
the ischemia phase, and it is significantly augmented
in the reperfusion phase [1, 2]. various mechanisms
have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of
ischemia-reperfusion (ir) injury. the implicated factors include free oxygen radicals, leukocyte migration
and activation, microcirculatory abnormalities, sinusoidal endothelial cell damage, activation of the coagulation
cascade, kupffer cell activation due to the release of inflammatory cytokines, and proteolytic enzymes [2– 6].
pharmacological agents, such as allopurinol, antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, and the university of
wisconsin solution, have been used to try to prolong
the duration of so-called safe ischemia [3, 7, 8].
type 3 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (pdeis), such
as  xxxd2341xxx  and milrinone, are widely used in the
clinical setting for their positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects [9, 10]. they inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase, block the conversion of 3=,5=-cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) to  xxxd81xxx ,
and increase the intracellular camp concentration
[9, 11]. the elevated camp level causes myocardial
muscle contraction by increasing the intracellular ionized calcium level and prolonged vasodilatation as a
result of phosphorylation of a camp-dependent contractile protein in the smooth muscle [9, 12], and camp

kucuk et al.:  xxxd2341xxx  in hepatic ir injury

has been used in a wide spectrum of experimental and
clinical studies on cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension, vascular diseases, platelet functions, reduction of ir injury, and preservation of graft viability
[9, 10, 12, 13].
although pdeis have primarily been used in the
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, recent studies
have revealed beneficial effects on the liver [9, 11, 13].
therefore it was the aim of this study to investigate the
effects of the  xxxd2341xxx  on a hepatic ir injury model in
rats. to our knowledge, there are only a few studies
and limited data in the literature about the protective
effect of  xxxd2341xxx , a selective type 3 pdei, on the
function of liver subjected to ir injury [14 –16], but in
these studies, the experimental model is not a pure
hepatic ir model due to the portal congestion. prolonged clamping of the portal vein has been shown to
induce different negative pathophysiological events
such as release of endotoxin and  xxxg2296xxx ,
damage to the intestinal mucosa, and bacterial translocation. many of these adverse effects are related to
damage to the gut owing to prolonged splanchnic venous stasis. furthermore, splanchnic congestion may
have a greater influence than hepatic ischemia in contributing to the deterioration of the physiological state.
a portocaval shunt allows decompression of the
splanchnic circulation and prevents mucosal and submucosal injury during total hepatic ischemia [17–19].
therefore, in this study model, portal congestion was
prevented using an extracorporeal shunt. an extracorporeal portosystemic shunt was then created by cannulating the cecal branch of the superior mesenteric
vein and the external jugular vein.
materials and methods
animal preparation
animal care complied with the guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals established by the ethical committee of the
university of erciyes, turkey. the study was performed at erciyes
university hakan cetinsaya experimental research centre
(dekam) between july and september 2002. sixty male wistar
albino rats bred in the same research center, weighing between 200
and 250 g at the age of 24 –32 weeks, were used for this study. the
animals were acclimatized for 1 week before the experiments. they
were housed in constant-temperature rooms and given standard rat
chow. only water was provided in the 12 h preceding the experiments. the animals were randomized into three groups: sham, ir
alone, and ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  groups, each one containing 20 rats.

sufficient, while still remaining well below the lethal dose [10]. in
addition, dosage guidelines for  xxxd2341xxx  are usually for a bolus
followed by an infusion [9]. in the sham and ir alone groups, normal
saline was infused at an equal volume and at the same time as
 xxxd2341xxx .

experimental procedures

general anesthesia was induced by an intraperitoneal 20 mg/kg ketamine-hcl (ketalar; parke-davis,
morris plains, nj) injection. the abdominal skin was
shaven and scrubbed with 1% cetrimide-chlorhexidine
solution. midline laparotomy was performed under
sterile conditions. in the sham group, only the hepatic
pedicle was identified. in the ir alone and ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  groups, hepatic ischemia was induced for 60 min
[2, 20] by cross-clamping the hepatic artery, portal
vein, and bile duct (pringle maneuver) with a vascular
microclip. rats were subjected to hepatic ischemia for
60 min, but portal congestion was prevented by the
extracorporeal shunt. an extracorporeal portosystemic
shunt was then created by cannulating the cecal
branch of the superior mesenteric vein and the external jugular vein, using polyethylene tubing (0.5 mm
inner diameter, 200 mm long; braun, d-34209) primed
with 0.04 ml heparinized saline solution (250 units/
ml). during all of the above interventions, the abdomen was closed temporarily. when the clamps were
released to end the ischemia, the bypass system was
removed. then, the cecal branch of the superior mesenteric vein was ligated with 4-o silk sutures. at the
end of the reperfusion, 10 rats in each group were killed
with an overdose of anesthetic. at this time, blood samples were also obtained by cardiac puncture to determine the serum aspartate aminotransferase (ast),  xxxg941xxx  (alt), and lactic dehydrogenase (ldh). furthermore, the liver was surgically
removed for  xxxd83xxx  (atp) assay and
histological examination. a single investigator performed all dissections to limit technical differences. to
determine the survival rate, the remaining 10 rats in
each group were monitored for 7 days after operation,
and no blood or liver tissue samples were taken from
these animals. after the surgical procedure, the abdominal incision was closed in two layers with 3-o
nonabsorbable sutures (prolene, ethicon, johnson &
johnson, somerville, nj), and the animals were allowed to recover and to take food and water.

jugular vein catheterization and infusion
silastic venous catheters (0.5 mm inner diameter; braun,
d-34209, melsungen, germany) were placed by cutdown into the
internal jugular vein, and 1 ml of blood was obtained from the
catheters before hepatic ir.  xxxd2341xxx  (sigma-aldrich, dorset, uk)
was given as a bolus dose of 2 mg/kg at the start of ischemia and
infused  xxxd1891xxx  ␮g/kg/min in the  xxxd2341xxx  group during the 3 h of the
ir period: 1 h of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion. the dose and
duration of  xxxd2341xxx  treatment were chosen so that they would be

liver function tests

blood samples were centrifuged immediately at 3000
rpm for 10 min and then serum samples were stored at
⫺80°c until the analysis. serum ast, alt, and ldh
levels were assayed using an autoanalyzer (konelab,
software version, 60i, espoo, finland).

changes were scored from 0 to 4, and the means of the
scores were taken.
survival rate determination

determination of the survival rate of the rats was
performed by monitoring live animals at day 7 after the
surgical procedure.

the data were analyzed with the statistical products
and service solution package (spss for windows, version 10.0.1, chicago, il). an analysis of variance test
was used in the comparison of parameters among all
three groups, and post-hoc intergroup comparisons
were made with a scheffe test. the results are expressed as means ⫾ standard deviation. statistical
significance was defined by a p value less than 0.05.

hepatic atp assay

results

the liver tissue samples for the atp assay were
immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at
⫺80°c in plastic tubes until the analysis. tissue samples were thawed and homogenized with an ultrasonographic homogenizator (virtis, virsonic 50, gardiner,
ny) at the time of the study. afterward, the liver atp
concentration was determined using a spectrophotometric atp assay kit (catalog no. 366-a, sigma chemical, st. louis, mo). the results are expressed as micromoles per gram of wet tissue.
histopathological examination

the liver biopsies were fixed in 10% formalin solution. five-micron-thick sections were cut from the
paraffin-embedded liver tissue specimens, routinely
processed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. a
pathologist who was unaware of the animals’ groups
evaluated the specimens by light microscopy. histopathological analysis, based on the scoring system
proposed by suzuki et al. [21], was applied on all samples to determine the degree of sinusoidal congestion,

analysis of survival rates

the survival rate in the ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  group was
significantly higher than the survival rate in the ir
alone group (p ⬍ 0.01; fig. 1).
serum ast, alt, and ldh levels

there were no differences between the initial values
of the three groups. following 2 h of reperfusion, the
ast, alt, and ldh levels in the ir alone and ir ⫹
 xxxd2341xxx  groups were significantly higher in comparison with the sham group (p ⬍ 0.01). the increase in
the ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  group was significantly lower than
the increase in the ir alone group (p ⬍ 0.05; table 1).

discussion

during the hepatic resection, to control the bleeding,
clamping of the portal pedicle— described by pringle in
1908 —is the most commonly used technique [16]. during this maneuver, cell damage occurs during the hypoxic phase and, interestingly, is augmented in the
following reperfusion period [1, 2, 22]. free oxygen
radicals,  xxxd208xxx  metabolites, leukocyte migration and activation, neutrophil infiltration, tumor
necrosis factor, and kupffer cell activation have been
implicated in ir injury [2, 23–25]. for success in hepatic resection, it is necessary to decrease the duration
of ischemia or mitigate its negative effects. accordingly, augmentation of the blood flow during reperfusion and control of inflammatory processes are gaining
importance. extensive studies have been performed on
the effects of vascular occlusion on the healthy, normal
liver. still, there is an ongoing debate on the safe limits
of warm ischemia in liver transplantation and hepatic
resection.
the portosystemic shunt has been reported as a surgical strategy to prevent splanchnic congestion associated with hepatic ir processes [26, 27]. the blood pooling in the splanchnic bed induces portal hypertension,
multivisceral edema, and a significant decrease in mesenteric arterial blood flow, culminating in intestinal
ischemia [28]. intestinal hypoperfusion has been implicated as a trigger of systemic organ dysfunction
response and sepsis, which commonly compromises
outcome after major hepatic surgery and liver transplantation. during hepatic reperfusion, it seems that
the release into the systemic circulation of proinflammatory substances from the intestine and spleen, re-

77

sulting from splanchnic congestion, induces liver and
lung damage and a portosystemic shunt reduces this
damage by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine expression [29]. the intestine acts as a barrier to prevent
toxins contained within the lumen from spreading to
the liver and distant organs. failure of intestinal barrier function when congestion occurs results in increased permeability to and subsequent translocation
of bacteria and toxins from the lumen [30, 31]. recently, bedirli et al. demonstrated that splanchnic congestion after portal triad occlusion increases apoptosis
in intestine and the use of a portosystemic shunt results in a reduction in the percentage of fragmented
dna, preserves the microscopic appearance of intestinal mucosa, and improves survival rate [27]. these
results suggest that portosystemic shunt on hepatic,
intestinal, and lung injuries associated with liver ir
injury would be useful in clinical practice.
type 3 pdeis, such as  xxxd2341xxx  and milrinone, have
been used in the field of cardiology for their inotropic
and vasodilating properties to treat heart failure [9, 12,
32]. in addition, recent studies have revealed some
hepatoprotective effects on the liver [13, 33, 34]. the
positive effects of type 3 pdei  xxxd2341xxx  on the liver
after ir injury may be explained by various mechanisms, and possible protective factors may be classified
into four groups, discussed in the following sections.
hemodynamic changes

it is known that, following heart surgery, the use of
pdeis can support blood flow, and this leads to improved portal circulation [35]. a lack of microvascular
flow due to vasoconstriction is an important factor in
hepatic ir injury [36]. kobayashi et al. [15] showed
that a significant improvement in hepatic tissue blood
flow was demonstrated in the injured tissues in
 xxxd2341xxx -treated rats.
regulation of intracellular camp levels

cellular camp, an intracellular second messenger,
plays an important role in cellular responses to various
stimuli, including ir injury [9, 12]. it has also been
reported that increases in intracellular camp concentration are associated with the prevention of inflammatory reactions, including hepatic ir injury [12, 32,
37]. ikegami et al. [38] investigated the effects of the
phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone on the functions
of liver grafts and found that camp levels were higher
and liver function was better in the milrinone-treated
group. increased intracellular camp concentrations by
pdeis stabilize the hepatocyte and endothelial cell
membranes and thus protect the liver against ir injury
[39]. camp improves blood flow to tissues with increasing myocardial contractility and with vasodilatation in
organs where it is effective [39].

hepatic stellate cell relaxation and inhibition of
platelet aggregation

the relaxation of hepatic stellate cells by pdeis
might have contributed to the improvement of sinusoidal circulation [40 – 42]. kawada and inoue [40] reported that the relaxation of hepatic stellate cells,
which are located in disse’s space and determine sinusoidal tonus, is induced via a camp-dependent mechanism. platelet aggregation is a causative factor that
aggravates ir injury [43]. the adherence of platelets to
the hepatic vasculature after reperfusion had detrimental effects on the viability of human liver allografts
[44].  xxxd2341xxx  inhibited human platelet activation at
the cellular level and protected against experimental
coronary thrombosis in dogs [45].
regulation of intracellular calcium levels

in some studies, pdeis increased the camp concentration, suppressed cytoplasmic calcium mobilization,
and decreased intracellular calcium concentrations
[41, 45]. liver ir injury is mediated, at least in part,
through an elevation in intracellular calcium [8, 46].
increased calcium concentrations also stimulate the
ca-atpase activity, deplete the intracellular atp
stores, inhibit atp synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation by activating proteolytic enzymes, and cause
cell death due to energy depletion [45, 46].
another factor in hepatic ir injury is mitochondrial
dysfunction [23]. fujii et al. [23] reported that insufficient blood flow impaired the hepatic mitochondrial
energy metabolism, depressed oxidative phosphorylation, and caused decreases in atp concentrations. similarly, in our study, the atp levels in the ir alone and
ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  groups were significantly lower than
those in the sham group (p ⬍ 0.01). the levels in the
ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  group were also higher in comparison
with the ir alone group (p ⬍ 0.01). there will be
difficulties to meet increased energy requirements in
the case of decreased intracellular atp levels, and this
may lead to cell death eventually. for liver ir injury in
a clinical setting, restoration of liver function is essential for preventing reperfusion injury. in this respect,
metabolic and energy support for the liver in the early
period after ir injury are important [38]. during this
growth period, energy expenditure exceeds atp availability, inducing a decline in energy state. increased
atp levels in the ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  group may affect
energy balance positively, with improved functional
and histological restoration.
enzymes such as alt, ast, and ldh are used as
markers of cellular damage following hepatic ir injury.
in various studies, it has been shown that the serum
concentrations of these enzymes increase in proportion
with the duration of ischemia. the levels persist for
some period during reperfusion and then return to
normal levels [22]. in our study, that the serum ast,

alt, and ldh levels of the ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  group were
significantly lower than those of the ir alone group and
were nearer the normal range suggests that  xxxd2341xxx 
decreases hepatic cellular damage. these effects of  xxxd2341xxx  after ir injury may be due to protection of
sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are the first target,
and improvement of sinusoidal blood flow by  xxxd2341xxx .
light microscopic studies showed that 30 and 45 min
of hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion is not associated with marked changes [47]. in contrast, 60 min
of ischemia followed by reperfusion may cause tissue
damage, and even necrosis [48]. in our study, 60 min of
ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion caused severe
sinusoidal congestion and cytoplasmic vacuolization in
midzonal areas. the changes were less marked in the
ir ⫹  xxxd2341xxx  group (table 2). these results show the
beneficial effects of  xxxd2341xxx  on hepatic ir injury at
the cellular level.
in conclusion,  xxxd2341xxx  treatment decreased liver
damage, according to both morphological and functional criteria, in this experimental ir model in rats,
even though its detailed mechanism of action remains
unclear. further experimental and clinical studies on
the protective role of  xxxd2341xxx  ir injury may contribute to increasing the safety of portal pedicle clamping.
