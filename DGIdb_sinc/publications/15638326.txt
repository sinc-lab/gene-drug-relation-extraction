the plecomacrolides  xxxd279xxx  a1 and b1 (1, 2) and concanamycin a (3), produced by
different streptomyces species, show a unique macrolactone structure with characteristic
side chains and exhibit striking biological activities including distinct v-type atpase inhibition.
the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 has been established by feeding experiments with 13c-labelled
precursors. both,  xxxd279xxx  (1, 2) and concanamycin (3) feature an "unusual c2 chain
extension unit" of as yet unknown origin which was addressed by feeding labelled 2-hydroxyand 2-methoxymalonyl-derivatives.

enhancement of c-11 and c-19 and moderate enhancement
of c-3, c-5, c-7, c-9, c-15, c-17 and c-21 in 1 and 2

direction of  xxxd279xxx  biogenesis by strong spin-spin
coupling of c-11/c-12 and c-19/c-20 (table 2) as depicted
in fig. 2. the results indicate two chain extensions with
acetate and low enrichments

for the methylmalonyl-coa

c-6', c-9' are additionally enriched in  xxxd280xxx  (2)

resulted in the exclusive signal enhancement of c-23 of 1
and 2 confirming the notion that isobutyrate is the starter
unit of the polyketide chain during  xxxd279xxx  biogenesis.
administration of [u-13c3]glycerolled to intact specific
incorporation of c-1/c-2 and c-13/c-14 (table 2) for the
"unusual c2 extender units", which confirms the hypothesis
that these c2 units arise from the carbohydrate metabolism.
c-11/c-12 and c-19/c-20 also showed a significant
labelling pattern (due to scrambling from glycerol into
malonyl-coa) while c-24/c-33 represents a coupling pair
of carbon atoms from the incorporation of glycerol into the
isobutyrate unit via pyruvate. the two methoxy groups
were labelled after feeding of [methyl-13c]methionine as
expected.
according to known chain extension mechanisms
2-hydroxymalonyl- and 2-methoxymalonyl-thioesters are
plausible precursors. 13c labelled 2-hydroxy- (4) and
2-methoxymalonyl-n-acetylcysteamine (snac) thioester
