wo isoforms of cyclooxygenase (cox), cox-1 and
cox-2, 1 - 4 catalyze human
prostaglandin synthesis. almost all currently available nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
inhibit both cox isoforms.5 cox-1 is
constitutively expressed and generates prostaglandins believed to be involved in gastrointestinal (gi) mucosal protection,6 while cox-2 is induced
at sites of inflammation throughout the
body and generates prostaglandins that
mediate inflammation and pain.7 therefore, the anti-inflammatory effects of
nsaids appear to be mediated via inhibition of cox-2,8 while the deleterious gi effects, a significant source of
morbidity and mortality, are believed
to occur primarily via inhibition of
cox-1.5 these gi-related adverse effects (aes)9-11 are estimated to be responsible for 107 000 hospitalizations
and 16 500 deaths annually in the
united states alone.12
rofecoxib (vioxx, merck & co,
inc, whitehouse station, nj) specifically inhibits cox-213,14; at dosages of
up to 375 mg/d for 12 days15 and up to
1000 mg in single doses,13 it had no
effect on cox-1 isoenzyme activity. in

context nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid)–induced gastrointestinal (gi)
toxic effects, such as upper gi tract perforations, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers,
and upper gi tract bleeding (pubs), are thought to be attributable to cyclooxygenase
1 (cox-1) inhibition. rofecoxib specifically inhibits cox-2 and has demonstrated a
low potential for causing upper gi injury.

adverse gi effects of rofecoxib vs nsaids

mg/d)19 and patients with osteoarthritis (at 25 and 50 mg/d).20
this study was a planned, blinded,
combined analysis of 8 randomized,
double-blind, phase 2b/3 clinical trials performed from december 1996
through march 1998 of rofecoxib inpatients with osteoarthritis to examine the incidence of upper gi perforations, symptomatic gastroduodenal
ulcers, and upper gi bleeding (pubs).
we hypothesized that the incidence of
pubs would be lower with rofecoxib
(12.5-, 25-, and 50-mg combined treatment groups) than with nsaids (ibuprofen, diclofenac, and  xxxd2688xxx 
combined treatment groups).
methods
the plan used to analyze the incidence
of pubs with rofecoxib compared with
nsaids was prespecified. pubs are rare
and large numbers of patients are necessary to evaluate the rate of incidence
with precision; therefore, in this analysis, we pooled patients from all 8 phase
2b/3 osteoarthritis trials of rofecoxib and
their blinded extensions (table 1). all
patients gave signed informed consent
and an institutional review board approved each study.
the analysis plan prespecified that
patients with asymptomatic ulcers di-

agnosed within a 7-day window surrounding the scheduled procedure dates
in the 2 surveillance endoscopy studies would be excluded from the analysis. eleven additional patients with
asymptomatic ulcers confirmed by investigators to have been detected at surveillance endoscopies scheduled outside the 7-day window for a variety of
reasons were also excluded.
investigators were instructed to report all laboratory and clinical aes, including upper gi dyspepsia and pubs,
that occurred during treatment and
within 14 days of study drug discontinuation. in all the studies, a final patient contact and/or evaluation was
scheduled for the 14th day following
study completion or study drug discontinuation. patients were followed up in
each study until final evaluation after
completion of study therapy or after
early discontinuation for any reason (eg,
diagnosis of pub, other ae, lack of treatment efficacy, withdrawal of consent),
death, or loss to follow-up.
clinical source documentation for
suspected pubs was reviewed by a
blinded, external adjudication committee. only pubs judged as confirmed, according to prespecified definitions
(table 2), were analyzed. pubs that occurred more than 14 days after the last

dose of study drug were not included
in the analysis (as prespecified).
adverse events, including pubs, were
coded blind to treatment with a standard automated dictionary that classified aes into broader categories
grouped by body system. we also compared discontinuations due to any gi
ae and discontinuations due to a prespecified subset of gi aes typical of upper gi symptoms associated with
nsaids.21-23 the latter category (hereafter referred to as “dyspeptic-type gi
aes”) consists of all aes mapped by the
dictionary to the categories of acid reflux, dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort,
heartburn, nausea, or vomiting.
analyses were based on all patients
treated in the 8 trials, with exceptions as
follows. patients from the placebo and
5-mg rofecoxib groups of protocol 029
(table 1) were switched after 6 weeks to
diclofenac, 12.5 mg of rofecoxib, or 25
mg of rofecoxib in an extension phase.
similarly, patients from the placebo
group of protocol 058 were switched after 6 weeks to  xxxd2688xxx , 12.5 mg of
rofecoxib, or 25 mg of rofecoxib in an
extension phase. to avoid doublecounting patients in the analyses, it was
prespecified that the data from patients

adverse gi effects of rofecoxib vs nsaids

controlled phase of both studies would
be excluded from analyses, while the data
from these patients’ extension phase
would be included. however, 117 such
patients (2.1% of the total population)
did not continue into extensions or did
not have extension data at the time of the
analysis and were therefore excluded.
a survival analysis of the time to first
pubdiagnosisdatewasusedforbetweentreatment comparisons. this method is
appropriate because it takes into account
the varying lengths of treatment in the 8
studies.forpubsdiagnosedininpatients,
the hospital admission date was used as
the diagnosis date. for pubs diagnosed
in outpatients, the date of the diagnostic procedure or clinical observation was
used. the log-rank test was the primary
method used to compare time-to-firstevent distributions between groups. the
cumulative incidence difference between
rofecoxib and nsaids was assessed at 6
weeks and at 4, 6, 12, and 24 months, usingthemethodofbreslowandcrowley.24
results are reported at 4 months (maximumdurationofplacebo)and12months
(no pubs occurred beyond 12 months).
differences between groups were considered significant when p,.05. the cox
proportional hazards model was used to
estimate overall relative risks (rrs) and
95% confidence intervals (cis) of rofecoxib vs nsaids. treatment by type of
protocol interactions were evaluated in
thecoxmodel.analysesstratifiedbytype
of protocol and analyses in which each
type of protocol was removed from the
analysis 1 at a time were performed to assess possible confounding.
results
the analysis included 5435 patients. of
these, 3357 patients were treated with
rofecoxib (1209, 1603, and 545 patients
received 12.5, 25, and 50 mg, respectively, once daily), 1564 patients were
treated with nsaids (847 received ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily; 590 received diclofenac, 50 mg 3 times daily;
and 127 received  xxxd2688xxx , 1500 mg
once daily) and 514 patients were treated
with placebo. total patient-years of exposure were 1428, 615, and 112, in the
rofecoxib, nsaid, and placebo groups,

respectively. the average dosage of rofecoxib was 24.7 mg once daily.
there were no clinically meaningful
differences in baseline characteristics between groups (table 3). mean age overall was 63 years (range, 38-94 years);
45% of patients were 65 years or older,
and 73% were women. most (90%) patients had previously used nsaids for
their osteoarthritis. approximately 10%
of the patients in each group had a prior
medical history of pub.
rofecoxib was generally well tolerated and fewer patients overall discontinued rofecoxib compared with the
nsaids (table 4); 9.4% of rofecoxib

patients vs 10.7% of nsaid patients discontinued the study drug because of any
clinical ae, and 3.5% of the rofecoxib
patients discontinued the study drug
due to a gi ae, compared with 4.8%
of nsaid patients (table 4). the cumulative incidence of dyspeptic-type gi
aes up to 6 months was significantly
lower with rofecoxib than with nsaids
(23.5% vs 25.5%; p = .02), after which
the incidence rates converged. the 12month cumulative incidences of study
drug discontinuation due to gi aes
were 5.7% vs 7.8% for the rofecoxib and
nsaid groups. the difference was significantly lower (p = .02) in the rofe-

rr = 0.70; 95% ci, 0.52-0.94).
forty-nine potential pubs were submitted by investigators and adjudicated; 5 (3 in the rofecoxib and 2 in the
nsaid group) did not meet the prespecified case definition because they occurred more than 14 days after study
drug discontinuation. of the remaining 44 cases, 38 (19 in the rofecoxib, 16
in the nsaid, 3 in the placebo group)
were adjudicated as having at least 1 confirmed pub, and 6 (all in the nsaid
group) were adjudicated as having un-

confirmed pubs. nine patients had more
than 1 pub (2, 3, and 4 in the placebo,
placebo,  xxxd3139xxx , and nsaid groups
respectively); all of these patients had 2
pubs each, except for 1 patient (nsaid
group) with 3 pubs. only the first pub
in a given patient was included in the
analysis. there were no pubs during the
small amount of patient exposure (25

years over 12 months were 1.33 and 2.60
for rofecoxib and nsaids, respectively.
the overall rr over 12 months for rofecoxib vs nsaids was 0.51 (95% ci,
0.26-1.00). analyses stratified by type of
protocol yielded very similar results to
the unstratified analyses (rr = 0.53; 95%
ci, 0.27-1.03; p = .06), and analyses that
sequentially removed each protocol type
also yielded consistent results, demonstrating a lack of confounding by type of
protocol. no statistically significant treatment by type of protocol interaction was
present (p..10) in the unstratified cox
model. the difference between rofecoxib and nsaids in the incidence of
confirmed pubs became statistically significant as early as 6 weeks (rr for rofecoxib vs nsaids, 0.21; 95% ci, 0.060.67; p = .004), and remained so up to
12 months.
in analyses confined to placebocontrolled protocols, which were up to
4 months in duration, the cumulative
incidence rates of confirmed pubs were
0.9%, 0.9%, and 1.6% for placebo, rofecoxib, and nsaids, respectively. the
corresponding rates per 100 patientyears over 4 months were 2.68, 2.50,
and 7.21. the rr over 4 months for
nsaids vs placebo was 2.50 (95% ci,
0.68-9.24), while that for rofecoxib vs
placebo was 0.94 (95% ci, 0.25-3.60).
comment
because pubs are rare, we carried out
a prespecified analysis of data obtained from 8 randomized, doubleblind phase 2b/3 osteoarthritis trials
with rofecoxib to determine whether
cox-2 specific inhibition would be associated with a lower incidence of pubs
than nonspecific cox inhibition. the
combined population included patients at high risk of pubs (eg, those
with a history of pub and/or age $65
years), as reported previously.25 the
analysis demonstrated a significantly
lower incidence of confirmed pubs with
rofecoxib than with nsaids over 12
months. in addition, the total rate of
study drug discontinuations due to gi
aes was significantly lower in the group
receiving rofecoxib than in the group
receiving nsaids.

adverse gi effects of rofecoxib vs nsaids

the analysis has particular strengths.
it was prospectively designed and used
prespecified adjudication criteria, hypotheses, and data analysis plans, and
an external, blinded committee adjudicated all reported pubs. it included all
phase 2b/3 osteoarthritis trials of rofecoxib and a broad range of patients, including those with prior pub history.
the primary hypothesis involved a biologically meaningful comparison of gi
safety with cox-2 specific inhibition vs
nonspecific cox-1/cox-2 inhibition,
and the doses of nsaid comparators for
the included studies were chosen to be
within the clinical dose range for treatment of osteoarthritis. the average dosage of rofecoxib in this study was 24.7
mg/d, which corresponds to the highest recommended daily dose (25 mg) for
osteoarthritis. both the 12.5-mg and
25-mg doses of rofecoxib have been
shown, using prespecified criteria, to be
therapeutically equivalent, in terms of
osteoarthritis symptom relief, to the
doses of the main comparator nsaids
(diclofenac and ibuprofen) used in this
study.26,27 the analytic methods took account of the varying lengths of the studies. analyses stratified by type of protocol demonstrated that difference in
study design was not a confounding variable in the assessment of pub risk with
treatment. statistical tests of treatment
by type of protocol interaction in the unstratified cox model indicated that the
assumption of a common rr was appropriate. because pubs are uncommon, there were generally too few within
any 1 study to provide precise studyspecific rr estimates. however, the
variation that did occur was compatible with the assumption of a common,
study-specific incidence rate ratio.
analyses in which each type of protocol was removed from the analysis 1 at
a time showed consistent results.
the analysis also had limitations.
first, there were only enough patientyears of exposure to compare pooled rofecoxib and nsaid comparators, rather
than individual treatments. second, inclusion of studies with scheduled endoscopies mandated in their protocols may have caused a bias against

rofecoxib. patients in these studies were
systematically discontinued from treatment when they developed endoscopically evident gastroduodenal ulcers 3
mm or more in diameter, and a much
higher rate of endoscopically detected
ulceration was observed in the ibuprofen than in the rofecoxib group.21 if patients discontinued from the study had
greater potential to develop a pub (eg,
because of an endoscopic ulcer or a
prior history of pub), then the inclusion of these 2 studies may have reduced the observed incidence of pubs
in the ibuprofen groups.
our analysis shows that cox-2 specific inhibition with rofecoxib was associated with a significantly lower risk
of pubs relative to nsaids. these findings are consistent with the results of
studies of intestinal permeability,17 fecal red blood cell loss,18 and upper gi
endoscopy19,20 with rofecoxib and indicate that risks of gi toxic effects associated with nsaids can be reduced
by cox-2 specific inhibition.
