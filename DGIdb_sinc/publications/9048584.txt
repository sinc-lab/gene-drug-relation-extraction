abstract
the rat  xxxg730xxx  (er) exists as two subtypes, era and
erb, which differ in the c-terminal ligand binding domain and in the
n-terminal transactivation domain. in this study we investigated the
messenger rna expression of both er subtypes in rat tissues by
rt-pcr and compared the ligand binding specificity of the er
subtypes.
saturation ligand binding analysis of in vitro synthesized human
era and rat erb protein revealed a single binding component for
16a-iodo-17b-estradiol with high affinity [dissociation constant (kd)
5 0.1 nm for era protein and 0.4 nm for erb protein]. most estrogenic
substances or estrogenic antagonists compete with 16a-[125i]iodo17b-estradiol for binding to both er subtypes in a very similar preference and degree; that is, diethylstilbestrol . hexestrol .  xxxd1878xxx  . 4-oh-tamoxifen . 17b-estradiol . coumestrol,  xxxd576xxx  .

distribution and/or the relative level of era and erb expression
seems to be quite different, i.e. moderate to high expression in uterus,
testis, pituitary, ovary, kidney, epididymis, and adrenal for era and
prostate, ovary, lung, bladder, brain, uterus, and testis for erb. the
described differences between the er subtypes in relative ligand
binding affinity and tissue distribution could contribute to the selective action of er agonists and antagonists in different tissues. (endocrinology 138: 863– 870, 1997)

(cdnas) cloned from mouse, human, and chicken (3). we
recently cloned a novel rat er cdna from prostate (4), which
we suggested be named rat erb subtype to distinguish it
from the previously cloned er cdna (consequently era
subtype). the rat erb cdna encodes a protein of 485 amino
acid residues with a calculated mol wt of 54200. rat erb
protein is highly homologous to rat era protein, particularly
in the dna binding domain (. 90% amino acid identity) and
in the c-terminal ligand binding domain (lbd) (55%). saturation ligand binding experiments with in vitro synthesized
erb protein revealed a single binding component for 17bestradiol (e2) with high affinity [dissociation constant (kd) 5
0.6 nm]. expression of erb was investigated by in situ hybridization, and prominent expression was found in rat prostate (secretory epithelial cells) and ovary (granulosa cells).
in cotransfection experiments of chinese hamster ovary
(cho) cells with an erb expression vector and an estrogen-regulated reporter gene, maximal stimulation of reporter gene activity was found during incubation with 1
nm e2 (4).
the biological significance of the existence of two er subtypes is at this moment unclear. perhaps the existence of two
er subtypes provides, at least in part, an explanation for the
selective actions of estrogens in different target tissues (5). in
fact, the high degree of interspecies conservation of the individual er subtypes throughout vertebrate evolution (ref.
6 and our unpublished observations) could suggest that the
basis for the selective effects of estrogens resides in the control of different subsets of estrogen-responsive promoters by

strogens influence the growth, differentiation
and functioning of many target tissues. these include
tissues of the male and female reproductive systems such as
mammary gland, uterus, ovary, testis, and prostate. estrogens also play an important role in bone maintenance and in
the cardiovascular system, where estrogens have certain cardioprotective effects (1). estrogens are mainly produced in
the ovaries and testis. they diffuse in and out of all cells, but
are retained with high affinity and specificity in target cells
by an intranuclear binding protein, termed the  xxxg730xxx  (er). once bound by estrogens, the er undergoes a
conformational change, allowing the receptor to bind with
high affinity to chromatin and to modulate transcription of
target genes (2). steroid hormone receptors consist of a hypervariable n-terminal domain that contributes to the transactivation function; a highly conserved central domain responsible for specific dna binding, dimerization, and
nuclear localization, and a c-terminal domain involved in
ligand binding and ligand-dependent transactivation function (1). the rat er cdna was cloned from uterus and found
to be highly homologous to the er complementary dnas

era and erb ligand binding

the two er subtypes. this would implicate differential expression of the er subtypes in target tissues.
the overall homology between the rat era protein lbd
and rat erb protein lbd is not more than 55% (fig. 1).
interestingly, the erb protein lbd encompassing amino acid
residues 223– 457 has a low homolgy with the era protein
lbd between amino acid residues 344 – 403, whereas outside
this stretch the homology is considerably higher (amino acid
residues 223–343 and 404 – 457). the structural core of the
lbd of the human era protein has recently been mapped by
restricted proteolysis, and only one single region within this
core was found to be easily accessible to proteases (7). this
surface-exposed protease accessible region (human era lbd
amino acid residues 465– 468) is in the center of the stretch
showing lowest homology with erb protein. the amino acid
sequence stretches of the erb lbd between amino acids
223–343 and 404 – 457 are probably, similarly to the highly
homologous stretches in the era lbd, part of a compact
hydrophobic (non-surface-exposed) entity directly contacting the ligand. although several parts of these stretches are
completely conserved, and the amino acid alterations often
are conservative, it is possible that interesting differences in
ligand binding affinity and/or specificity exist between the
er subtypes. chemically quite diverse compounds (estrogens, some androgens, phytoestrogens, antiestrogens, and
environmental estrogens) have been shown in the past to
have estrogenizing activity and to interact with the er from
rat uterus and human breast tumor cells (ref. 8 and references therein).
in the present study we investigated the ligand binding
specificity of the two er subtypes and the transcript tissue
distribution in the adult rat.

ikapharm (ramat-gan, israel) and from roussel uclaf (romainville,
france), respectively.

merck index or elsewhere (8–10).
sephadex g25 columns (qs-2a) were obtained from isolab (akron,
oh). all other chemicals were of the highest purity available.

in vitro transcription and translation
the 2.6 kbp rat erb cdna (4) was subcloned into the ecori site of
pbluescript (stratagene, la jolla, ca). the plasmid pt7bher (11) containing the wild type (hego) human era sequence was a kind gift from
dr. b.w. o’malley and co-workers (baylor college of medicine, houston, tx). human era and rat erb protein was synthesized in vitro using
the tnt-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (promega, madison, wi)
with t7-rna polymerase, during a 90 min reaction at 30 c. translation
reaction mixtures (50-ml portions) were snap-frozen and stored at 270 c
until further use.

saturation ligand binding analysis
translation reaction mixtures were diluted in buffer a (20 mm
hepes, ph 5 7.9; 150 mm nacl, 10% wt/vol glycerol, 1 mm edta, 6
mm  xxxd2668xxx , and 10 mm na2 moo4) and kept at 4 c. aliquots
equivalent to 0.25 ml era translation mixture or 2 ml erb translation
mixture were incubated in duplo with 10 – 800 pm [125i]-e2 in the presence or absence of  xxxd3426xxx -fold excess of diethylstilbestrol for 16 h at 4 c.
the final incubation volume was 200 ml, and to the era incubation series
unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate was added to equalize the total protein concentrations. free and unbound radioligand was separated by
gelfiltration over g-25 columns at 4 c as described (12). bound radioactivity was measured in a wallac g-counter (turku, finland) with 70%
efficiency. specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific
binding from total binding, and the free ligand concentration was estimated by subtracting total bound ligand from added ligand. the equilibrium kd was calculated as the free concentration of radioligand at
half-maximal binding by fitting data to the hill equation (13) and
by linear scatchard transformation (14). curve fitting was done in
kaleidagraph 2.1.3 (abelbeck software, pa).

ligand competition experiments
competitors were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at a concentration
of 1 mm, except for coumestrol, genistein, and b-zearalanol, which were
dissolved in ethanol. translation reaction mixtures were diluted with

era and erb ligand binding
buffer a and kept at 4 c. aliquots equivalent to 0.25 ml era translation
mixture or 2 ml erb translation mixture were added to dilutions containing [125i]-e2 and the respective competitors. the final concentration
of radioligand was 125–150 pm, and the incubation time was 16 h at 4
c. unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate was added to the era series to
equalize protein concentrations. competitors were present at concentrations between 1024 m and 10210 m; each competition curve consisting
of eight concentrations in duplicates. free and bound ligand were separated by gelfiltration over sephadex g-25 columns as described (12).
the data were evaluated by a nonlinear four-parameter logistic model
(15) to estimate the ic50 value (the concentration of competitor at halfmaximal specific binding). relative binding affinity (rba) of each competitor was calculated as the ratio of concentrations of e2 and competitor
required to reduce the specific radioligand binding by 50% (5 ratio of
ic50 values). the rba value for e2 was arbitrarily set at 100. the chengprusoff equation (13, 14) was used to calculate the ki of the various
competitors.

pcr analysis of rat tissue total rna
male and female rats (6 – 8 weeks old) were killed by cervical dislocation, and tissues were collected. tissue samples were immediately
processed for total rna isolation according to the acid guanidinium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform single-step extraction protocol (16). the
integrity and quality of the purified rna was controlled by formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and by measurement of the
a260/a280 nm ratio. only rna samples exhibiting an a260/a280 ratio
.1.6 and showing integrity of the rna by electrophoresis were used in
further experiments. the rna isolated from spleen and brain cortex
appeared degraded and was discarded.
random hexamer-primer cdna synthesis was performed as described (17, 18). for the pcr amplification, 5% of the synthesized cdna
was added to a pcr reaction mixture as described (17) and amplified for
30 cycles by incubation at 95 c for 30 sec, 57 c for 15 sec, 72 c for 60 sec,
and a final incubation at 72 c for 3 min, all in a pcr 9600 thermocycler
(perkin-elmer, norwalk, ct). the oligonucleotides erbkg1: 59ttcccggcagcaccagtaacc (138 relative to atg) and erbkg2: 59tccctctttgcgtttggacta (1279 relative to atg) were used for amplification of a 262-bp fragment of the erb messenger rna (mrna).
the oligonucleotides kgb5: 59aattctgacaatcgacgccag (1472
relative to atg) and kgb6: 59gtgcttcaacattctccctcctc (1794
relative to atg) were used for amplification of a 344-bp fragment of the
rat era mrna. the oligonucleotides used for the amplification of actin
mrna are previously described (17). after agarose gel electrophoresis
and blotting to nitrocellulose filters, the pcr products were hybridized
to the internal oligonucleotides: erur 4: 59gggactcttttgaggttctgc (1163-182 relative to atg) for erb, kg50: 59gcagcgagaagggaaacatga (1518-538 relative to atg) for era, and
actin primer: 59gatgacccagatcatgtttga (1434-454 relative
atg) for actin according to a previously described protocol (17).

about 7s, and it shifted to 4s in the presence of 0.4 m nacl
(not shown). it was therefore decided to use human era and
rat erb protein synthesized in reticulocyte lysates for the
ligand binding experiments.
to obtain optimal conditions for the determination of equilibrium kds and rbas of various ligands, the er concentration in the binding assay was lowered to 10 –20 pm. at these
low er concentrations radioligand and/or competitor depletion can be excluded while maintaining high receptor
recovery during separation of bound and unbound ligand by
the use of a gel filtration assay instead of the traditional
charcoal adsorption assay (12). the low er concentration
made it necessary to employ radioiodinated estradiol as a
probe, because the specific radioactivity of tritiated estradiol
was too low to maintain sufficient accuracy. radioiodinated
e2 (16a-[125i]iodo-e2) binds to the er with high affinity and
specificity as shown by its use in dry-mount autoradiographic techniques and various ligand binding assays (19,
20).
in fig. 2 the result of a saturation ligand binding assay with
[125i]-e2 is shown. single point assays (not shown) were used
to equalize the amount of era and erb protein used (10 –15
pm). the nonspecific binding was #8% of total binding over
the whole radioligand concentration range used. the kd
values calculated from the saturation curves (fig. 2) were
0.06 nm for era protein and 0.24 nm for erb protein. linear
transformation of saturation data (scatchard plots in fig. 2)
revealed a single population of binding sites for 16a-iodo-e2
with a kd of 0.1 nm for the era protein and 0.4 nm for the
erb protein. the measured kd values are in agreement with
the finding that almost maximal stimulation of reporter gene
activity by era and erb protein was previously found during incubation with 1 nm e2 (4). although the erb protein has
a four times lower affinity for 16a-iodo-e2 in this system
compared with the era protein, both kd values are within

results
saturation ligand binding analysis of er protein

the er can be isolated from the cytosol of target cell
extracts as a large nontransformed (i.e. non-dna binding)
7– 8s oligomeric complex, which contains hsp90 and hsp70
(2). it is believed that heat-shock proteins function to help
fold the er protein properly and to protect the hydrophobic
hormone binding domain from inappropriate interactions
(2). rabbit reticulocyte lysates contain large amounts of several heat-shock proteins as hsp90 and hsp70, and have been
used extensively for the study of er complex formation with
hsps, as well as for the study of requirements for steroid
binding and interactions with dna (2, 6, 11). when erb
protein was synthesized in vitro and labeled with a saturating
dose of [3h]-e2 and analyzed on sucrose density gradients,
a single peak of specifically bound radioactivity was observed. the sedimentation coefficient of this complex was

periments were performed using era and erb protein concentrations of 10 –15 pm and a [125i]-e2 concentration of about
150 pm, so that for both ers the total receptor concentration
was #0.1 kd and the radioligand concentration was $10
times the er concentration. under such experimental conditions radioligand or competitor depletion can be excluded
(14).
in total 37 substances were tested for both er subtypes

a
rba of each competitor was calculated as ratio of concentrations
of e2 and competitor required to reduce the specific radioligand binding by 50% (5 ratio of ic50 values). rba value for e2 was arbitrarily
set at 100. the ic50 of e2 was 0.21 nm for era protein and 0.13 nm
for erb protein.
b
the cheng-prusoff formula (13, 14) was used to calculate the ki
of the various competitors.

competitor curves obtained are shown. in all cases monophasic curves were obtained for compounds with significant
affinity. the slopes of the curves were almost similar, enabling the use of ic50 values to calculate rba values (table
1), with an rba value of 100 for e2 for each receptor. for the
era as well as erb protein, the estradiol binding was stereospecific because 17a-estradiol showed a two times and 10
times lower affinity, respectively (table 1), compared with
e2, which is in agreement with previous findings on stereospecific binding of estradiol by the er (21). however, in
making such comparisons, it should be kept in mind that
most, if not all, er ligand binding studies done in the past
30 yr actually involved mixtures of era and erb protein.
this is certainly the case for many studies in which rat uterus
cytosol was used (see following). the present study is the
first in which the ligand binding properties of both er subtypes are measured separately, and caution is needed when

867

comparing rbas from this study with the previous studies
involving mixtures of er subtypes.
for the physiological estrogens, the order of competition
was e2 . estrone, 17a-estradiol (era) . estriol . catecholestrogens, 17a-estradiol (erb) . estrone-3-sulfate. overall
the era and erb proteins show the binding characteristics
and relative affinity for the physiological estrogens found to
be characteristic for an er protein (1, 8, 22). the stilbene
estrogens, which consist of a composite diphenolic ring
structure, bind with high affinity to both er subtypes. however, different orders of competition were found: diethylstilbestrol . hexestrol .  xxxd1878xxx  . (e2) for era and
 xxxd1878xxx  . diethylstilbestrol . hexestrol . (e2) for erb.
the extra methoxy group at c11 and the ethynyl group at
c17 of moxestrol (ru 2858) lowered the affinity compared
with e2 for the era protein by only a factor of 2 but for the
erb protein by a factor of 20. moxestrol is in use as a radioligand in er assays, and is known to have a lower binding
affinity than e2 under certain assay conditions (23).
the triphenylethylene (anti)estrogens were developed by
successive chemical modifications of the triphenylethylene
nucleus, formed by the addition of an extra phenyl ring to the
stilbene nucleus as present in for instance diethylstilbestrol
(9, 10). interestingly, the measured order of affinity for the
tested triphenylethylene (anti)estrogens was the same for
both er subtypes: 4oh-tamoxifen ..  xxxd2692xxx  .  xxxd1725xxx  . tamoxifen. the steroidal antiestrogen  xxxd576xxx 
had a high affinity for era as well as for erb, confirming that
extensions at c7 do not preclude ligand-er interactions (9,
24).
it has been known for a long time that a number of compounds classified as androgens (c19 steroids) can evoke
estrogen-like effects in the female genital tract and in the
mammary glands (25). of all the androgens tested only those
with a hydroxyl group at c3 and c17 had significant affinity
for both er subtypes (table 1). the relative flatness of the
a-ring with respect to the b-ring is also important, given the
clear difference in affinity for both er subtypes between
5-androstenediol and 4-androstenediol. the binding affinity
of 3b- xxxd175xxx  and 5-androstenediol for both er subtypes is in agreement with previous studies showing specific
binding to the rat uterus er and estrogenic responses in rat
uterus and mammary tumors for both steroids (26, 27).
norethynodrel and  xxxd2751xxx , progestins derived
from 19-nor-testosterone, and 19-nor-testosterone itself have
an intrinsic estrogenic potential as shown by the induction of
alkaline phosphatase activity in er-positive human endometrial cancer ishikawa cells (28). the apparent binding affinity of norethynodrel and  xxxd2751xxx  for both er subtypes was however, only about 1/500th of that for e2 (table
1), and the need for a conversion into more active metabolites
by aromatization or hydroxylation at c-3 has been suggested
(28).
several plant-derived nonsteroidal compounds such as
genistein and coumestrol have estrogenic activity (8). these
compounds increase rat uterine weight and stimulate growth
of breast tumor cells and compete with e2 for binding to er
protein as well as stimulate the activity of reporter genes in
the presence of er protein (ref. 29 and references therein).
both coumestrol and genistein had a significantly higher

era and erb ligand binding

affinity for erb protein (table 1), which is interesting in the
light of the high expression of erb mrna in the secretory
epithelial cells of the prostate, and the prostate cancer protective properties that have been associated with these compounds (30). zearalanols are fungal metabolites or derivatives thereof that have been associated with estrogenizing
syndromes in cattle fed with mold-infected grain (8). despite
the fact that zearalanols are structurally very different to
known steroidal and nonsteroidal estrogens, they interact
with the rat uterus cytosolic er (31). also, in our competition
assays b-zearalanol interacted with both er subtypes with a
similar affinity (table 1), as was reported previously for the
rat uterus er protein (31).
abnormal sexual development in reptiles as well as the
increasing incidence of certain human reproductive tract abnormalities (such as hypospadias) has been associated with
increased exposure to and body burdens of so-called estrogenic environmental chemicals (32, 33). these effects from
estrogenic chemicals as, for instance, the pesticide  xxxd2143xxx  and the plastics ingredient  xxxd346xxx , are postulated
to be mediated via the er because these compounds have
estrogenic effects (increase of uterine weight) in female rats
(8, 32, 33).  xxxd346xxx  and  xxxd2143xxx  both inhibited the
binding of [125i]-e2 by the era and erb protein, and the
inhibition seemed to be stronger for the erb protein (table
1). however, it was clearly a very low affinity interaction,
and the fact cannot be excluded that it involved different sites
on the er than those involved in the binding of e2.
expression of era and erb mrna in rat tissues

to determine the relative distribution of era and erb
mrna, total rna was isolated from rat tissues and used for
rt-pcr using primers specific for each er subtype. all tissues were taken from 6- to 8-week-old male rats, except
uterus and ovary, which were taken from 8-week-old female
rats. although this assay was only semiquantitative, it is clear
that the relative distribution of both er subtypes was quite
different (fig. 4). highest expression of erb mrna was
found in the ovary and prostate, which is in agreement with
our previous in situ hybridization experiments using male
and female rats of similar ages (4). in addition, testis, uterus,
bladder, and lung showed moderate expression, whereas
pituitary, epididymis, thymus, various brain sections, and
spinal cord reveal low expression of erb mrna. the era
mrna was highly expressed in epididymis, testis, pituitary,
uterus, kidney, and adrenal, which all showed moderate or
no expression of erb mrna. aside from weak expression
in thalamus/hypothalamus, the brain sections tested were
negative for era mrna. ovary and uterus, which are
known to contain high amounts of er protein (1), clearly
expressed both er subtypes. all organs from male rats previously described to display specific binding of [3h]-e2 to an
8s cytosolic protein, i.e. liver, lung, adrenal, pituitary, prostate, epididymis, and testis, showed clear expression of either
er subtype mrna or both (34, 35).
discussion

the ligand binding affinity of era and erb protein is
overall quite similar for the physiological ligands, certainly

when only the order of competition is compared. the most
interesting difference was found for 17a-estradiol, which has
a five times higher affinity for era protein. the physiological
action of 17a-estradiol is quite different from that of e2,
because 17a-estradiol is a short-acting estrogen and actually
a time-dependent mixed agonist-antagonist in the rat/
mouse uterus (1). short-acting estrogens (estrone, estriol, and
17a-estradiol) do cause nuclear binding of the hormonereceptor complex but only for a short period of time (1). it
would be interesting to see whether the difference found for
17a-estradiol in our ligand binding assays is also present in
a transactivation assay system. for the other types of ligands
tested, i.e. antiestrogens, androgenic steroids, and phytoestrogens, there are some interesting differences in the rbas
(table 1), but it remains to be seen whether these differences
are also reflected in a transactivation assay system using
different cellular backgrounds. the erb protein clearly displays all the ligand binding characteristics of a classical er
protein (1, 8 –10, 21, 22, 26 –29, 31, 36), and therefore it seems
unlikely that a unique physiological ligand for the erb protein exists. the relative order of ligand binding for various
estrogens (diethylstilbestrol, estrone, and estriol) is slightly
different in this study than in our previous study (4). our
previous rather preliminary assay (4) was hampered by relatively high levels of nonspecific radioligand binding (30 –
40% compared with about 5% in this report), which might
explain the difference.
a question of considerable interest is why, despite the
numerous ligand binding assays performed for the er protein, an indication for the existence of two er subtypes was
never published. of course, distinguishing between a mixed
population of receptor subtypes and a homogeneous receptor population by saturation or homologous/heterologous
competition assays is generally difficult. this is only possible
with certainty when the two subtypes differ sufficiently in
affinity (10- to 100-fold), and the range of ligand concentrations examined is wide. furthermore, the proportions of the
two subtypes must be appropriate (37). of all the radioligands used in er assays (e2, des, hexestrol, moxestrol, 16aiodo-estradiol), the difference in affinity for moxestrol between both er subtypes is the greatest (8-fold) in our
experiments. in this regard, it should be realized that to
detect the existence of receptor subtypes the higher affinity

era and erb ligand binding

subtype should be less abundant than the lower affinity
subtype (37). most er ligand binding assays have been done
with uterus extracts and breast tumor extracts or cell lines,
and it could be that the right conditions for the detection of
receptor subtypes are not fulfilled in these cases. we have
been unable to detect the erb mrna in various breast tumor
cell lines (mcf-7, t47d, zr75-1) by rt-pcr (our unpublished observations), whereas both subtypes are expressed in
rat (fig. 4) and human uterus (not shown).
in prostate and ovary, the two tissues that express high
levels of erb mrna, it has been difficult to demonstrate the
presence of ers by immunostaining with the available er
antibodies, although specific binding of e2 could be measured (1, 8, 34). in human and rat prostate at best only weak
staining in stromal smooth muscle cells was found (38, 39),
which is in contrast with our results showing high expression
of erb mrna in the prostate secretory epithelial cells (4). in
the rat and human ovary, specific binding of estradiol was
found in intact follicles and granulosa cells (40 – 41), but no
er could be detected with available er antibodies (41). these
discrepancies could be explained by the fact that the most
frequently used er protein antibodies, h-222 and h-226 (42),
do not cross-react with rat erb protein on immunoblots (our
unpublished observations). the above findings and our results could indicate that the erb protein is the predominant
if not the only er subtype present in rat prostate and ovary.
of course this remains to be proven when specific erb protein antibodies become available. the fact that disruption of
the era gene in vivo did not eliminate the ability of small
follicles to grow, as is evident from the presence of secondary
follicles and antral follicles in the era knockout mouse (43),
also argues for the presence of alternative er (erb?) molecules. in fact, rat uterus, ovary, testis, epididymis, and pituitary clearly express both er subtypes mrnas. although
we have no data on erb mrna expression or protein concentration in tissues of the era knock-out mouse (43), the
possible presence of erb protein should be kept in mind
when interpreting experiments using the era knock-out
mouse. furthermore, in the uterus of the era knock-out
mouse, residual e2 binding could be measured (43), which is
likely caused by the presence of erb protein. in the brain of
the era knock-out mouse, specific binding of e2 and modulation of  xxxg1737xxx  gene expression by e2 was
observed (44). again this is most likely caused by the presence of erb protein, because the erb mrna is broadly
expressed in the rat brain and probably also in the mouse
brain at a low level. detailed mapping of era and erb
expression in rat/mouse brain by in situ hybridization or
using specific antibodies for each subtype is of clear interest
given the fact that for the localization of ers in the brain of
various species antibodies that do not recognize erb have
been used (45).
