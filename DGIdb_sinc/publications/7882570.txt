summary
elevation of intracellular camp levels has been shown previously to inhibit cytokine secretion by
various cell types in vitro. since salmeterol is a /jj-agonist which activates adenylate cyclase, its
ability lo inhibit cytokine production was evaluated. though salmeterol, and the related drug
albuterol. did not inhibit il-l/i produclion in vitro, both drugs did inhibit tumour necrosis factoralpha ( xxxg2296xxx ) secretion by lipopolysaccharide (lps)-activated thp-1 cells with similar icjos of
approximately olyim. this inhibition was effectively reversed by the /i2-antagonist  xxxd2812xxx ,
indicating that the inhibition was mediated through the ,tf2-adrenergic receptor. a strikingly
different reactivity profile was seen with t cells. salmeterol was able to inhibit the activation of
both mouse and human tcelis. as measured by proliferation and il-2 secretion in response to anticd3 antibody, whereas albuterol was completely inactive in these assays. this t cell inhibition by
salmeterol was about 10-fold less potent than that for  xxxg2296xxx  production, and was not reversed by
a /32-antagonist, indicating thai a different mechanism was involved in the effect of salmeterol on t
cells. paralleling the  xxxg2296xxx  inhibitory activity in vitro, oral dosing of salmeterol and albuterol
inhibited lps-induced increase in murine serum tnf level in vivo, with edsos of approximately
01 mg/kg. this inhibition could be abrogated by dosing orally with the /^blocker propranolol.
the long-acting pharmacological profile of salmeterol was apparent in that it maintained its
efficacy for 3h. while albuterol had a much shorter duration of action. salmeterol also had some
protective effects in the galactosamine/lps model of endotoxic shock, which is dependent upon
 xxxg2296xxx  production. though satmeterol inhibited serum  xxxg2296xxx  levels by up to 94% in this assay, it
protected less than 50% ofthe animals from the lethal effects ofthe lps/gal actosa mine mixture.
this observation suggests that functional levels of  xxxg2296xxx  localized in tissues may not be
accurately reflected by serum levels.

introduction
selective regulation of cytokine production appears to be an
important element in many ofthe pathological manifestations
of inflammation. in particular, the inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  and
il-i production appears lo be particularly important, since
inhibition of these cytokines can play an effective role in the
treatment of septic shock and other inflammatory conditions,
such as rheumatoid arthritis [i 4]. one mechanism for reducing secretion of many cytokines produced by monocyte/macrophages [5-9] or t cells [10] is elevation of inlracellular camp
levels. moreover, agents which increase intracellular camp
concentrations not only reduce cytokine secretion, they can

also inhibit the release of hydrolytic enzymes and other
proinflammatory mediators [ii 14].
increasing inlracellular camp levels can be achieved in a
number of ways., including phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibition
and stimulation of prostaglandin and ii;-adrenergic receptors
[7-10]. pde-iv inhibitors, which slow camp degradation by
inhibiting type iv phosphodiesterases, are potent inhibitors of
cytokine production [15,16] and are effective in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced endotoxic shock models (sekut et al,
manuscript submitted). it has also been demonstrated that
agents which directly activate adenylate cyclase, such as
prostaglandin ei (pge2) or  xxxd1742xxx . elevate camp levels
and inhibit il-lji and  xxxg2296xxx  produclion in vitro [1]. since ;iiagonists also elevate intracellular camp levels, they could be
potentially useful anti-inflammatory agents if the unacceptable

side-effects accompanying systemic administration could be
overcome by localizing or targeting the 02 agonist.  xxxd2401xxx , a non-specific /3-agonist, has been shown to inhibit tnfq production by thp-1 cells, acting at the transcriptional level,
and to affect post-transcriptional regulation of il-1 [10,17].
the /?2-agonist albuterol has also been reported to inhibit tnfq production by human monocyte cell lines [10]. we have now
examined the activity of salmeterol, the newest long-acting
/?2-agonist, in both in vitro and in vivo models of cytokine
production. the data indicate that salmeterol is also a potent
inhibitor of  xxxg2296xxx  production in vitro and in vivo., and, at a
10-foid higher concentration, also has inhibitory effects on
t cell activation which are not shared by albuterol and are
not due to the ^2-agon'st properties of this drug.

materials and methods
animals
female inbred c57b1/6 and c3h/hen mice (approximately 22 g
each) were obtained from charles river labs inc. (raleigh,
nc). both strains gave a similar pattern of serum  xxxg2296xxx 
activity in response to lps injection, although c57bi/6 mice
were somewhat more sensitive to lps in combination with
galactosamine, while c3h/hen mice were more sensitive to lps
alone.
compounds
salmeterol hydroxynaphthoate (us patent number 4992 474)
was synthesized by glaxo inc. albuterol (us patent number
3705 233), propranolol and  xxxd2812xxx  were obtained from
sigma chemical co (st louis. mo). for oral dosing, compounds were suspended at the appropriate concentration in
0-1 % methyl cellulose and ground in a homogenizer. and 0-5 ml
administered to each mouse by oral gavage. for in vitro studies,
compounds were dissolved in dmso and diluted to 0 1 % in
culture medium. lps (serotype 0111 :b4; sigma) was prepared
and stored as frozen stocks in saline at 5 mg/ml.

of the cells was assessed at 72 h by measuring the incorporation
of ^h-methyl thymidine during the last 18 h of culture. parallel
experiments were done with cba mouse spleen cell suspensions, in this case stimulated with purified hamster monoclonal
anti-mouse cd3 (1452c11) at a 1:1000 dilution. for il-2
secretion studies, expieriments were set up in the same way,
with 100^1 culture supematants taken after 24h. il-2 in these
supernatants was measured in a standard ctll proliferation
assay, and results for compounds were expressed as a percentage inhibition of proliferation induced by supematants activated in the absence of compound. this was always submaximal when compared with the response to recombinant
il-2.
serum tnfm vivo following sublethal lps injection
to induce elevation of serum  xxxg2296xxx  levels, lps (5/ig/mouse)
was injected intraperitoneally into c3h mice which had been
fasted overnight. mice were dosed orally with compounds
60 min before lps injection, or as indicated in results. exactly
90 min after lps injection, previously determined to be the
peak for  xxxg2296xxx  levels in this system [18], mice were bled from
the heart. the serum from the clotted blood was collected the
following day and serum t n f - q levels were determined by
elisa as above.
lpsjgalaciosamine model of endotoxic .shock
c57b1/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0 5 ml of a
mixture of lps (0 01 or 0-1/ig/mouse) and galactosamine
(600 mg/kg; aidrich chem. co., milwaukee, wi). serum was
obtained from one group of mice (n - 4) 90 min after injection
and analysed for  xxxg2296xxx  levels as described above. survival was
assessed after 24 h on the remaining mice (n = 6).

cytokine secretion in vitro
the thp-1 cell line., a human monocytic cell line, was obtained
from atcc (rockville, md). supematants taken from cells
cultured for i week in antibiotic-free media tested negative for
mycoplasma infection (lineburger cancer centre, university
of north carolina). the cells were routinely cultured in 75-cm^
tissue culture flasks (costar, cambridge, ma) in rpmi1640
(gibco, grand island, ny) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(fbs; hyclone labs, logan, ut), 2mm l-glutamine (gibco)
and 50^g/ml gentamicin sulphate (sigma). thp-1 cells were
incubated in 96-well plates at 5 x 10^ cells/well with various
concentrations of compound plus 10/ig/ml lps in rpmi
medium. supematants were removed 4h later for t n f - q
analysis and 24h later for il-1/3 analysis. commercially
available elisa kits (genzyme, cambridge, ma) were used
to measure cytokines in culture supematants.
t cell activation studies
human splenic mononuclear cells, prepared by  xxxd3253xxx 
hypaque density centrifugation, and stored in frozen aliquots
before use, were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates at
2 x 10^cells/well in dmem containing 10% fbs in the

results
effect of salmeterol on cytokine secretion in vitro
salmeterol and albutero! were incubated with thp-1 cells, a
human monocyte cell  xxxg694xxx , to determine whether the drugs

inhibited lps-induced secretion of il-1/? and tnf-«.
though neither compound inhibited ll-1/3 (data not shown),
both drugs reduced t n f - q in the cell supernatant in a dosedependent fashion (fig. 1). salmeterol and albuterol possessed
similar potency, inhibiting  xxxg2296xxx  by 72% and 59%, respectively, at 0 1 fim. the in vitro profile of salmeterol inhibition was
not statistically different from that of albuterol. dexamethasone (dex), used as a positive standard at 01/am, reduced
 xxxg2296xxx  levels by approximately 65%. normal untreated control supernatant (nor) possessed no detectable  xxxg2296xxx . this
pattern of inhibition was similar to that obtained using human
peripheral blood cells (data not shown). the inhibition of
tnf-q production by salmeterol, especially at the low concentration, could be attributed to its /?2-agonist function, since
inhibition was reversed by the (^blocker  xxxd2812xxx  (fig. 2).
 xxxd2812xxx  itself had no effect on  xxxg2296xxx  production.
we also evaluated the effect of salmeterol on activation of
murine and human lymphocytes. as shown in fig. 3, salmeterol
inhibited proliferation of  xxxd2676xxx -activated mouse (fig. 3a)
and human (fig. 3b) splenic t cells. salmeterol also inhibited
il-2 production from activated mouse spleen cells (fig. 3c).
this effect was about  xxxg147xxx -fold less potent than the inhibition
of tnf-f> production in thp-1 cells, and was not reversed in
the presence of a /j-blocker (data not shown). the related, but
short-acting /32-agonist albuterol was completely inactive in
these assays. together, these results suggest that, unlike inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx , inhibition of t cell activation is not related to
the /32-receptor binding activity of salmeterol.
effect of salmeterol on lps-induced serum tnflevels
since the /^2-agon'sts were active against t n f - q production in
vitro, they were tested in vivo, for inhibition of lps-induced
murine serum  xxxg2296xxx  production. in preliminary studies not
shown, mice were pretreated orally with salmeterol or albuterol
30 min before lps injection and blood taken 90 min later. in
this initial study, both salmeterol and albuterol significantly
(p < 0 05) reduced lfs-lnduced serum tnf levels, with edsq
values of approximately 01 mg/kg (data not shown). since
salmeterol is a long-acting ^2-agonist, the time between

we wished to determine if the in vivo inhibition of t n f - q

by salmeterol was dependent upon ils /^agonist properties as
shown by ils inhibition of tnf in vitro. serum tnf levels were
measured in lps-injected mice dosed with salmeterol with and
without the /^-blocker propranolol (fig. 5). salmeterol was
given p.o. 60min before the lps injection. propranolol
(lomg/kg, p.o.) was given twice: 30 min before and after dosing
with salmeterol. as shown in fig. 5. salmeterol alone inhibited
serum tnf-o in a dose-dependent manner. however,
propranolol abolished the salmeterol-induced inhibition
(f < 0 05). the elevation of serum  xxxg2296xxx  levels in mice
receiving propranolol and a high dose of salmeterol could be
due in part to the fact that propranolol alone potentiated serum
tnf-q levels approximately 20%.

since salmeterol was such a potent inhibitor of serum  xxxg2296xxx 
production, il was evaluated for its ability to protect mice from
lethality in the lps/galactosamine model of endotoxic shock
(fig. 6).  xxxd1891xxx  and 30 mg/kg, salmeterol reduced serum tnf
levels 94% and 92%. respectively, in mice injected with
galactosamine plus 0 1 / i g lps. however, it protected less
than half the animals from lethality, even at the high
30 mg/kg dose. in a second exp)eriment, when a 10-fold lower
injection of lps (001 /xg/mouse) was administered, salmeterol
 xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg and 30mg/kg still protected only 50% and 66% of
mice from death by endotoxic shock, while still inhibiting
serum  xxxg2296xxx  by greater than 90%.

effect of salmeterol on  xxxg2296xxx  production
discussion
cytokine interactions form a complex web which may
up-regulate or down-regulate the response to infection or
injury' to the host. since cytoltincs have both pro- and antiinflammatory activities, it would be desirable to be able to
selectively regulate cytokine produclion in the treatment of
inflammatory diseases [1.3,19,20]. in vitro experiments have
shown that cytokine production can be inhibited by elevation
of intracellular camp. and suggest that this may be a very
ettective way of down-regulating the response of the cells to
inflamagens such as endotoxin.
,*i-adrcncrgic receptors arc 7-transmembrane proteins
which arc g-protein coupled to adenylate cyclase. thus,
binding of agonists triggers the production of camp. we
have shown here that the .it-agonists albuterol and salmeterol
inhibited lps-induced t n f - q production by thp-l cells, but
had no effect on \l-\ii production. this inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx 
production was a potent effect (icjo values approximately
loonm) and was clearly mediated through the j;-rccepior
since it was reversed by u i^-antagonist. the selective effect
of ;*i-agonists on  xxxg2296xxx  production contrasts with that of
non-selective /j-agonists, which inhibit both tnf-o and il-1.
this suggests that different intracellular camp compartments
and/or trafficking events may be involved.
since increases in intracellular camp concentrations have
been shown to inhibit t cell ktivation we examined the effects
of salmeterol and albuterol on anli-cd3-stimu]ated activation
of mouse and human t cells. salmeterol (but not albutero!)
inhibited t cell activation, albeit ul an approximately 10-fold
higher concentration than that at which it inhibited tnf.
whether this in vitro inhibitory effect of salmeteroi on t cells
will translate into in vivo immunosuppressive activity remains
to be investigated.
an inhibitory effect of salmeterol and albuterol on t n f - q
production was also shown in vivo. serum tnf-o levels in mice
injected with a sublethal concentration of lps (5^g/mouse)
were inhibited by orally administered compounds, with ed50
values of 0 i mg/kg. our data from the serum tnf-n model
confirmed the long-acting nature of salmeterol as reported by
johnson [21] and ball *•/ al. [221. *^ur results showed that
salmcterol had a longer duration of action than albuterol and
was efficacious even when given 3h before lps injection, at a
time when albutcrol was inactive. despite salmeterol's potency
in the rcduciiun of scrum  xxxg2296xxx , ihis compound, used alone.
offered only partial protection in the lps/galactosamine model
of endotoxic shock.
the use of ,(32-agonlsts in the control of inflammatory
responses has also been evaluated by other investigators
[10,23 27]. one group has reported inhibition of tnf-o
secretion in mast cells following in vitro incubation with
js2.agoni8ts [28]. others have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory- activity of salmeterol against neutrophils [29] or t
cells [30]. in some cases j-agonists appear to inhibit at the
transcriptional level, as dimitr>' ft al, have repcirted inhibition
of  xxxg1180xxx  transcription in lung fragments treated with  xxxd2401xxx  [31}. sever et al. on ihe other hand, demonstrated that
adrenaline and isoprotcrenol blocked tnf-o produclion in
human blood cells at the post-transcriptional level [10]. if
^-agonists inhibit cytokines at a relatively late (post-transcriptional) stage in cytokine secretion, then they may be useful in

the later stages of acute inflammation, at a time when earlier
acting transcriplional inhibitors are not very useful they may
also complement or synergize with the actions of other antlinfiammatories. such as pde inhibitors or steroids [32]. in
addition. j;-agonists rapidly inhibit lps-induced tnf-o
release in vitro as opposed to the delayed action of steroids,
which showed maximal effectiveness when present before lps
stimulation [33]. this properly of steroids represents a major
disadvantage when using them as therapy late in acute, lifethreatening forms of infiammation. thus, despite their high
potency against cytokines. steroids have not improved the
survival rate of patients with sepsis [34-36].
in the current study we investigated the effect of/^i-agonists
on tnf-rt inhibition in vitro and in animal models of
inflammation. though this study focused mainly on antiinflammatory activity in animal models of acuic inflammation, work done by seo & sacki [25] demonstrated the
combined effectiveness of albuterol and aminophyiline in
adjuvant arthritis, a chronic model of inflammation. the
authors further reported that aminophyiline (a pde inhibitor) alone, possessed only weak anti-inflammatory activity,
possibly due to the fact that cells from arthritic rats treated
with aminophyiline alone did not have significantly elevated
leveis of intra«llular camp [25|. it is possibie that the use of
/^^-agonists, in combination with pde inhibitors, might serve
to boost camp level and provide a more potent inhibition of
cytokine production. in addition, combination therapy may
lower the therapeutic dose, thereby minimizing side-effects.
in apparent contrast to seo & saeki's work [25], coderre
et al. reported that catecholamines exacerbated arthritis by
acting on prcsyuapuc .i^-adrenoceptors [26.27]. however, in
these experiments compounds were continously infused over a
28-day period, which is known to cause desensiti/jition of
.i-receptors [37-39]. in addition, ihe activity of the catecholamines on the o-adrenergic receptors mighl have caused a
proinflammatory reaction, since spengler et al. [40] have
demonstrated that stimulation of o-adrenergic receptors
increased tnf production in vitro.
finally, it is possible that specific d^-agonists like salmeterol, in conjunction wiih moabs, soluble cytokine receptors or
traditional steroids, might be useful in a multi-step approach
towards the treatment of septic shock syndrome or oiher
serious diseases in which cytokines play a pathogenic role,
like acute episodes of lupus or flairs assckiated with rheumatoid arthritis.
