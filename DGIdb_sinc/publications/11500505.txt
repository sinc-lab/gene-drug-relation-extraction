running title: a conserved tryptophan and  xxxg15xxx  substrate specificity

summary
the atp-binding cassette (abc) proteins comprise a large superfamily of transmembrane
transporters that utilize the energy of atp hydrolysis to translocate their substrates across
biological membranes.  xxxg12xxx  (mrp) 2 ( xxxg15xxx ) belongs to subfamily c
of the abc superfamily and when overexpressed in tumour cells, confers resistance to a wide
variety of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents.  xxxg15xxx  is also an active transporter of organic
anions such as methotrexate (mtx), estradiol glucuronide (e217betag) and leukotriene c4 (ltc4),
and is located on the apical membrane of polarized cells including hepatocytes where it acts as a

mrp1 that is critical for the substrate specificity of this protein. in the present study, we have
examined the effect of replacing the analogous tryptophan residue at position 1254 of  xxxg15xxx .
we found that only non-conservative substitutions (ala, cys) of trp1254 eliminated [3h]e217betag
transport by  xxxg15xxx , while more conservative substitutions (phe, tyr) had no effect. in addition,
only the most conservatively substituted mutant (w1254y) transported [3h]ltc4, while all other
substitutions eliminated transport of this substrate. on the other hand, all substitutions of trp1254
eliminated transport of [3h]mtx. finally, we found that  xxxd3256xxx  stimulated [3h]e217betag
transport by wild-type  xxxg15xxx  4-fold, while transport by the trp1254 substituted mutants was
enhanced 6- to 10-fold. in contrast,  xxxd3256xxx  failed to stimulate [3h]mtx transport by
either wild-type  xxxg15xxx  or the  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants. taken together, our results demonstrate
that trp1254 plays an important role in the ability of  xxxg15xxx  to transport conjugated organic anions
and identify this amino acid in the putative last transmembrane segment (tm17) of this abc
protein as being critical for transport of mtx.

introduction
the atp-binding cassette (abc)1 proteins comprise a large superfamily of
transmembrane proteins that use the energy of atp hydrolysis to translocate their substrates
across biological membranes (1-3). one branch of the superfamily, known as subfamily c,
presently consists of 12 human proteins, seven of which are designated multidrug resistance
protein (mrp) 1-7 (4-5). mrp1 ( xxxg13xxx ) was the first of the mrp-related transporters to be
cloned and increased expression of this protein in tumor cells results in resistance to a
remarkably diverse spectrum of anticancer drugs and other xenobiotics (5-10). mrp1 is also a

conjugated to glutathione (gsh), glucuronide and sulphate (5,10-16). well characterized
organic anion substrates of mrp1 include the  xxxd2146xxx  antimetabolite methotrexate (mtx), the
cysteinyl leukotriene c4 (ltc4), and the conjugated estrogen, 17beta-estradiol 17-(beta-dglucuronide) (e217betag) (8,10,15-21).
the ability of mrp1 to confer drug resistance and transport organic anions is shared by
several other proteins belonging to the abcc subfamily, including  xxxg15xxx  ( xxxg15xxx ) (11,21-24).
mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx  have in common a five domain structure with a core consisting of two
tandemly arranged units, each containing a membrane spanning domain (msd) and a nucleotide
binding domain (nbd), that is preceded by a third msd with an extracytosolic nh2-terminus
(fig. 1a) (10,11,25). the substrate specificities of the two proteins are also similar in many
respects, although certain significant differences have been identified (11,26-28). mrp1 and
 xxxg15xxx  also differ with respect to their levels of expression in normal tissues, as well as their
membrane localization in polarized cells. for example, mrp1 is expressed in many tissues
throughout the body and localizes to basolateral membranes of polarized cells including

hepatocytes and pneumocytes (29,30) while  xxxg15xxx  is found predominantly in the canalicular
(apical) membrane of hepatocytes where it functions as a biliary transporter (11,26,31).
mutations in the  xxxg15xxx  gene that create a premature termination codon have been
identified in two hyperbilirubinemic rat strains, the groningen yellow/transport-deficient wistar
rat (gy/tr-) and the eisai hyperbilirubinemic rat (ehbr), and are associated with the absence
of detectable  xxxg15xxx  protein (32,33). in humans, the absence of functional  xxxg15xxx  protein has been
associated with several different missense, nonsense and deletion mutations in the  xxxg15xxx  gene in
patients with a rare disorder known as dubin-johnson syndrome (34-37). this disorder is

from hepatocytes into bile, and deposition of a dark pigment in the liver .
the specific amino acids in  xxxg15xxx  involved in the recognition and transport of its
substrates remain largely unknown although two recent reports indicate that certain charged
residues in or close to tm segments of the second and third msds are important (38,39). in a
previous study of the related mrp1, we identified a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the
last tm segment of msd3, trp1246, that is essential for the transport of e217betag, as well as for
the ability to confer resistance to cationic and electroneutral natural product drugs (40). in
contrast to the effect on drug resistance and e217betag transport, we found that the variously
substituted mrp1-trp1246 mutants were capable of transporting ltc4 with only a modest
decrease in affinity (km) for this gsh conjugated substrate.2 in the present study, we have
mutated the analogous tryptophan residue in tm17 of  xxxg15xxx , trp1254 (fig. 1a), and show that all
but the most conservative substitutions markedly reduce the protein’s ability to transport
conjugated substrates in a way that differs quantitatively and qualitatively from comparable
trp1246 mutants of mrp1. in addition, we have identified trp1254 as being critical for the ability

vector construction and site-directed mutagenesis - to generate an  xxxg15xxx  expression
vector, a dna fragment containing the complete coding sequence of human  xxxg15xxx  mrna with
an optimized kozak sequence was synthesized from several polymerase chain reaction products
obtained from human a549 and hepg2 tumor cells and assembled in the vector pbluescript ii
ks+ (stratagene, la jolla, ca). the coding sequence of  xxxg15xxx  cdna was then moved into
pcdna3.1(-) (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and the integrity of the resulting pcdna3.1(-)- xxxg15xxx 
vector was confirmed by sequencing the entire inserted sequence in both directions. the
sequence obtained was in agreement with that published previously (accession number
xp005809).
the template for site-directed mutagenesis of trp1254 of  xxxg15xxx  was prepared by cloning a
2 kb xbai fragment of  xxxg15xxx  corresponding to nucleotides 2349-4404 into pgem-3z.
mutagenesis was carried out using the transformer kit (clontech, palo alto, ca) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions with the following sense mutagenic primers (substituted

embryonic kidney cells (hek293t) as follows. approximately 5 x 106 cells were seeded in 175
cm2 flasks and 24 h later, dna (16 µg) was added using fugene 6 (roche diagnostics,
laval, pq, canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. after 48-72 h, the hek293t
cells were harvested and inside-out membrane vesicles prepared as described previously (18).
empty vector pcdna3.1(-) dna and vector containing the wild-type  xxxg15xxx  cdna were
included as controls in all transfection experiments.
measurement of  xxxg15xxx  protein levels in transfected cells - the relative levels of wildtype and trp1254 mutant  xxxg15xxx  proteins were determined by immunoblot analysis of membrane
protein fractions from the transfected cells, essentially as described (40,41). proteins were
resolved on a 6-7% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a nylon membrane. membranes
were blocked with 4% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1 h followed by incubation with the mrp2specific murine mab m2i-4 (alexis, san diego, ca) (diluted 1:2500 or 1:5000) (41,42). after
washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody

levels of  xxxg15xxx  protein expression were estimated by densitometric analysis using a

 xxxg15xxx -mediated transport of [3h]e217betag and [3h]ltc4 by inside-out membrane
vesicles - inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from the transiently transfected
hek293t cells and atp-dependent transport of [3h]-labelled substrates by the membrane
vesicles was measured using a rapid filtration technique as described previously (18,41). briefly,
e217betag transport assays were performed at 37 oc in a 60 µl reaction containing 400 nm

creatine kinase (100 µg  xxxg1167xxx ), and 8 µg of vesicle protein in transport buffer (50 mm tris-hcl,
250 mm sucrose, ph 7.4). in some experiments,  xxxd3256xxx  (100 µm) and mtx (500 and
1000 µm) were added. uptake was stopped at 5 min by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer, and
then the reaction was filtered through glass fibre (type a/e) filters that had been presoaked in
transport buffer. radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. all data were
corrected for the amount of [3h]e217betag that remained bound to the filter, which was usually
<10% of the total radioactivity. transport in the presence of amp was subtracted from transport
in the presence of atp to determine atp-dependent e217betag uptake. all transport assays were
carried out for time periods during which uptake was linear, based on preliminary time course
studies. thus transport activities represent initial rates. assays were carried out in triplicate and
results expressed as means (± sd).
uptake of [3h]ltc4 was measured in a similar fashion except that membrane vesicles (8
µg protein) were incubated at 23 oc for 3 min in a total reaction volume of 50 µl containing
[3h]ltc4 (50 nm; 40 nci) and other components as described for [3h]e217betag transport.

kidney cells but only conservatively substituted  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants transport [3h]e217betag
- we showed previously that both conservative and non-conservative substitutions of trp1246 in
mrp1 eliminated the e217betag transport activity of this protein (40). to determine whether
 xxxg15xxx -mediated e217betag transport activity would be similarly affected, cdna constructs were
generated in which several different amino acids were introduced in place of the analogous
tryptophan residue in  xxxg15xxx , trp1254. these included non-conservative substitutions with a nonaromatic non-polar amino acid (ala; w1254a- xxxg15xxx ) and a non-aromatic polar amino acid
(cys; w1254c- xxxg15xxx ), as well as conservative substitutions with polar (tyr; w1254y- xxxg15xxx )
and non-polar (phe; w1254f- xxxg15xxx ) aromatic amino acids. the constructs were transfected into
hek293t cells and after 48-72 h, cells were harvested, membrane vesicles prepared and relative
 xxxg15xxx  protein levels were determined by immunoblotting (41,42). as shown in fig. 1b, wildtype  xxxg15xxx  and its four mutants (w1254a, w1254c, w1254y, and w1254f) were all expressed
in the hek293t cells at comparable levels. mean values of expression levels from 4-6

independent transfections relative to wild-type  xxxg15xxx  were w1254a, 1.1; w1254c, 0.9;
w1254f, 0.9; w1254y, 1.0, respectively (fig. 1b).
atp-dependent transport of [3h]e217betag was determined using the membrane vesicles
prepared from the transfected hek cells (fig. 2a). like the non-conservatively substituted
mrp1-trp1246 mutants, the w1254a- xxxg15xxx  and w1254c- xxxg15xxx  mutants either did not, or only
very poorly, transported [3h]e217betag (fig. 2b). however, e217betag transport by the w1254ymrp2 and w1254f- xxxg15xxx  mutants was similar to that of wild-type  xxxg15xxx , in marked contrast
to the comparable conservatively substituted mrp1-trp1246 mutants which were inactive for

only the most conservatively substituted  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutant transports [3h]ltc4 previously, we found that the ltc4 transport capacity of the trp1246 substituted mrp1 mutants
remained intact although affinity (km) for this glutathione conjugated substrate was modestly
reduced compared to wild-type mrp1 (40).2 in contrast, [3h]ltc4 transport activity was
essentially eliminated in vesicles containing three of the four  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants, with levels
of transport being comparable to those of vesicles prepared from control cells transfected with
the empty pcdna3.1(-) vector (fig. 2b). the [3h]ltc4 transport activity of the fourth and most
conservatively substituted mutant, w1254y- xxxg15xxx , was approximately 40% of wild-type  xxxg15xxx .
[3h]e217betag transport by w1254f- xxxg15xxx  is no longer inhibited by ltc4 - it has been
shown previously that ltc4 inhibits  xxxg15xxx -mediated e217betag transport (39,44). consequently,
to determine whether e217betag transport by a mutant  xxxg15xxx  protein that no longer transports ltc4
could still be inhibited by this cysteinyl leukotriene, [3h]e217betag transport by the w1254fmrp2 mutant was examined. as shown in fig. 3, ltc4 (1 µm) inhibited [3h]e217betag transport
by wild-type  xxxg15xxx  by approximately 50% as expected. in contrast, ltc4 had no significant

effect on [3h]e217betag transport by w1254f- xxxg15xxx , indicating that the loss of ltc4 transport by
this mutant is associated with a loss of binding of this substrate.
transport of [3h]mtx by  xxxg15xxx  is eliminated by trp1254 substitutions - to determine
whether the conservative and non-conservative trp1254 substitutions might affect the transport of
 xxxg15xxx  substrates other than glutathione and glucuronide conjugated organic anions, [3h]mtx
uptake was measured in membrane vesicles prepared from cells transfected with wild-type and
mutant trp1254  xxxg15xxx  cdnas. as shown in fig. 4a, atp-dependent [3h]mtx transport by
wild-type  xxxg15xxx  was readily detectable. in contrast, [3h]mtx transport by all four  xxxg15xxx -

protein expression and subtracting the background transport activity of the membrane vesicles
from the vector transfected control cells, the relative levels of [3h]mtx transport by the
w1254a, w1254c, w1254f, and w1254y mutants were 14%, 14%, 11% and 1%, respectively,
of wild-type  xxxg15xxx . thus both conservative and non-conservative substitutions of trp1254
essentially eliminated mtx transport by this abcc transporter.
[3h]e217betag transport by wild-type  xxxg15xxx , but not w1254f- xxxg15xxx , is inhibited by mtx
- it has previously been shown that mtx inhibits  xxxg15xxx -mediated transport of the gsh
conjugated substrates, dinitrophenyl-glutathione and  xxxd2684xxx -glutathione (21,24). in
the present study, we found that mtx also inhibits e217betag transport. thus [3h]e217betag
transport by wild-type  xxxg15xxx  was inhibited by approximately 25% and 50% at concentrations of
500 and 1000 µm mtx, respectively (fig. 4b). to determine whether e217betag transport by
mutant  xxxg15xxx  proteins that no longer transport mtx remained inhibitable by this antifolate,
[3h]e217betag transport in membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing w1254f- xxxg15xxx  and
w1254y- xxxg15xxx  was examined. in contrast to wild-type  xxxg15xxx , mtx had no significant effect

trp1254 mutant proteins was very low. after taking into account the different levels of  xxxg15xxx

on [3h]e217betag transport by either w1254f- xxxg15xxx  or w1254y- xxxg15xxx  at concentrations of
either 500 or 1000 µm mtx (fig. 4b). these results indicate that the loss of mtx transport by
 xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants is associated with a loss of binding of mtx to the protein.
 xxxd3256xxx  stimulates [3h]e217betag transport by wild-type and mutant  xxxg15xxx  but
has no effect on [3h]mtx transport - it has been reported previously that transport of gsh and
glutathione conjugates by  xxxg15xxx  can be markedly stimulated by several organic anions, including
 xxxd3256xxx  (21,27,45). we have now found that  xxxd3256xxx  (100 µm) can also stimulate
[3h]e217betag transport by  xxxg15xxx  (fig. 5a). in addition, we observed that [3h]e217betag transport

9-fold and 10-fold, respectively, by  xxxd3256xxx  compared to 4-fold for wild-type  xxxg15xxx .
these results suggest that the trp1254 mutations may augment the ability of  xxxd3256xxx  to
stimulate transport of conjugated organic anions by  xxxg15xxx . in contrast, 100 µm  xxxd3256xxx 
had no effect on [3h]mtx transport by either wild-type  xxxg15xxx  or any of the four  xxxg15xxx -trp1254
mutants (fig. 5b).

discussion
 xxxg15xxx  was first identified as a hepatocellular (canalicular) organic anion transporter and
was originally cloned from rat liver using strategies that took advantage of its structural similarity
to human mrp1 (11,32). the human, rabbit, mouse and canine cdnas were cloned soon
thereafter and the five orthologs show a high degree of amino acid identity with one another (7783%) (46-49). as demonstrated for mrp1, studies of  xxxg15xxx -enriched membrane vesicles and
the purified reconstituted recombinant protein show that  xxxg15xxx  exhibits an atpase activity that
can be stimulated by its substrates (21,50,51). however,  xxxg15xxx  is unique among the mrp-

related proteins in that it is found exclusively on the apical membrane of polarized cells whereas
the other mrp transporters are localized on the basolateral membrane. moreover, since  xxxg15xxx  is
expressed predominantly in hepatocytes, renal epithelia and intestinal enterocytes, it is
particularly well situated to play a role in the elimination, as well as oral bioavailability, of drugs,
xenotoxins and their conjugated metabolites (41,52-56).
the amino acid sequence of human  xxxg15xxx  is 49% identical to mrp1 and it has been well
established that both proteins can transport a similar spectrum of organic anions in vitro,
although it is clear that some differences exist with respect to substrate affinity and specificity.

conjugated organic anion e217betag, as well as being essential for the ability of this protein to
confer resistance to cationic and electroneutral natural product chemotherapeutic agents,
including doxorubicin, vincristine and  xxxd2068xxx  (etoposide) (40). because of the primary structure
similarity and shared substrate specificity of mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx , we anticipated that mutation of
trp1254 in  xxxg15xxx  which is analogous to mrp1 trp1246, would result in phenotypic changes
similar to those observed in mrp1. however, unlike mrp1, where any substitution of trp1246
eliminated e217betag transport activity (40), we observed that only non-conservative substitutions
of trp1254 (ala, cys) resulted in loss of transport of this conjugated organic anion by  xxxg15xxx . in
contrast, levels of e217betag transport by  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants with conservative substitutions
(tyr, phe) were similar to those of wild-type  xxxg15xxx . these findings suggest that the architecture
of the e217betag binding pocket of  xxxg15xxx , in contrast to mrp1 (40), can be maintained as long as
the amino acid at position 1254 is capable of participating in aromatic interactions. aromatic
interactions also appear critical for ltc4 transport activity by  xxxg15xxx , again in contrast to mrp1,
since transport of this conjugated organic anion was eliminated when trp1254 was replaced with

we have recently shown that the highly conserved trp1246 in mrp1 is critical for transport of the

page 13 of 27

ala and cys. however, ltc4 transport by  xxxg15xxx  was also markedly reduced when trp1254 was
replaced with phe but less so when it was replaced with tyr. these findings suggest that in
addition to its aromaticity, the hydrogen bonding properties and possibly the size of the lateral
sidechain of the tryptophan residue, are important for  xxxg15xxx -mediated transport of this
glutathione conjugated substrate. the selective loss of ltc4 transport activity of the w1254fmrp2 mutant was matched by the inability of the cysteinyl leukotriene to inhibit [3h]e217betag
transport by this mutant, suggesting that loss of ltc4 transport is caused by a loss of binding of
this substrate to the protein.

structurally related endogenous reduced folate derivatives are reported to be substrates of several
mrp-related proteins (8,21,24,43,56). however, as observed with their other substrates, the
overall capacity of the different mrps to transport mtx varies considerably. in the present
study, we found that  xxxg15xxx  in hek cell membranes transported mtx much more efficiently
than mrp1 (data not shown), in agreement with the earlier findings of bakos et al (21) using
membrane vesicles derived from insect cells expressing these two transporters.
as mentioned previously, it has recently been shown that certain charged residues located
in or close to tm segments in msd2 and msd3 are important in the transport of some
conjugated molecules by  xxxg15xxx  (38,39). however, in these studies, transport of mtx by  xxxg15xxx 
was not investigated. we found that, in contrast to the transport of the conjugated substrates
e217betag and ltc4, which was selectively lost depending on the nature of the amino acid
replacing trp1254, [3h]mtx transport activity was eliminated regardless of whether the
substitution was conservative or not. these data are the first to identify a single amino acid as
being critical for  xxxg15xxx -mediated transport of this clinically important antifolate drug and

downloaded from http://www.jbc.org/ by guest on october 15, 2019

in addition to conjugated metabolites, the widely used anticancer agent mtx and certain

page 14 of 27

indicate a stringent requirement for a tryptophan residue at position 1254.
previously, mtx has been reported to inhibit the transport of the glutathione conjugates
of dinitrophenyl and  xxxd2684xxx  by  xxxg15xxx  and a competitive mode of inhibition has been
suggested (21,24). we have now shown that transport of [3h]e217betag by wild-type  xxxg15xxx  can
also be inhibited by mtx. however, although [3h]e217betag transport by the  xxxg15xxx -w1254f and
 xxxg15xxx -w1254y mutants appeared unchanged despite their inability to transport mtx, transport
of the conjugated estrogen was no longer inhibited by the antifolate agent. these findings
suggest that loss of mtx transport by the  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants is matched by a loss of binding

the role of this highly conserved trp residue in tm17 of the cooh-proximal msd3 of
 xxxg15xxx  and the related mrp1 is not clear. since trp1254 is predicted to be at the membrane
cytosol interface, it may serve to anchor the position of tm17 (57), and in this way, ensure the
correct positioning of the tm segments involved in substrate recognition and transport. it is also
possible that it may interact directly with at least some mrp substrates because the tryptophan
indole ring could contribute to cation- pi bond formation with substrates containing positive
charges or polarities, pi-pi stacking interactions with substrates containing aromatic rings as well
as hydrogen bonding interactions with polar substituents (58). of the three  xxxg15xxx  substrates
examined in the present study, none were transported by the non-conservatively substituted
w1254c and w1254a mutants, one was transported by the w1254f mutant, and two were
transported by the w1254y mutant. these data indicate that trp1254 interacts differently with
these different  xxxg15xxx  substrates and further, as proposed earlier for mrp1, that each substrate
establishes its own unique set of atomic contacts in a multipartite substrate binding pocket of
 xxxg15xxx , although it is clear that within each set, many binding determinants are held in common.

it is of interest to note that  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 and mrp1-trp1246 are positioned on the same
hydrophilic side of the amphipathic helix (within one position or helix turn) as the two amino
acids in the comparable tm segment of the sulfonylurea receptors sur2a/ xxxg20xxx  (leu1249,
thr1253) and  xxxg19xxx / xxxg19xxx  (thr1286, met1290) that were recently shown to be intimately involved
with the activation of katp channels by k+ channel openers (59) (fig. 6a).  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 and
mrp1-trp1246 are also on the same side of tm17 as thr1242 which we have recently determined
is important for mrp1 substrate specificity (60). these observations, together with labelling
studies with photoaffinity analogs (61,62), suggest that the polar face of this last tm helix plays

proteins belonging to the abcc subfamily. the exceptionally high degree of amino acid
conservation of the tm17 sequences of the abcc proteins lends further support to this
conclusion (fig. 6b) (40).
several organic anions, including the uricosuric agent  xxxd3256xxx , have been shown
to inhibit the transport of certain mrp1 substrates whereas at most concentrations, mrp2mediated transport of gsh and gsh conjugates is stimulated by these organic anions
(21,27,45). the molecular basis for this remarkable difference between mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx  is
unknown. however, we have now extended these earlier observations by demonstrating that
 xxxd3256xxx  can also stimulate transport of glucuronide conjugates by  xxxg15xxx  as exemplified
by e217betag. transport stimulation by  xxxd3256xxx  was maintained in all of the variously
substituted  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants, and indeed, for those with conserved substitutions, the
magnitude of [3h]e217betag transport stimulation by  xxxd3256xxx  was increased. exactly how
 xxxd3256xxx  stimulates transport of conjugated substrates by  xxxg15xxx  is unclear and appears
complex (27). however, our finding that  xxxd3256xxx  stimulated the e217betag transport

a common and particularly critical role in the formation of a substrate-binding pocket in transport

page 16 of 27

activity of all four  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 mutants suggests that the binding site for this organic anion
may be distinct from the binding site of the glucuronide conjugated estrogen. thus it appears
likely that transport stimulation is occurring through some type of positive cooperativity or
allosteric activation mechanism (27). why  xxxd3256xxx  neither stimulated nor inhibited mtx
transport by  xxxg15xxx  is unknown but again is consistent with the idea of  xxxg15xxx  having more than
one drug binding site.
another remarkable difference in the interaction of mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx  with organic anions
was recently revealed by our demonstration that transport of the 3-o-glucuronide conjugate of

by gsh whereas transport of this substrate by mrp1 was completely dependent on the presence
of this tripeptide or certain of its analogs (41). the amino acids in mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx  that are
responsible for their differences in substrate and inhibitor/stimulator specificity and affinity
remain to be identified; however, the observations of the current and previous studies indicate
that it is not possible to predict the substrate or inhibitor specificity of an  xxxg22xxx  on the
basis of amino acid conservation, either with homologs in the same species or orthologs in
different species (1-3).
recently, compelling evidence that polymorphisms in the  xxxg10xxx  ( xxxg10xxx ) gene encoding
the 170 kda p-glycoprotein can play a clinically important role in the bioavailibility and
disposition of a variety of important drugs including anticancer agents, immunosuppressive
drugs, cardiac drugs and steroids has been reported (63). based on the results presented here and
elsewhere (32,33,38-40,64), it seems clear that certain mutations in  xxxg15xxx , and possibly mrp1,
can also be expected to contribute to altered pharmacokinetics of certain anticancer agents such
as mtx. this in turn could affect their efficacy and/or the incidence and severity of toxic side

effects associated with their use. such mutations might also affect an individual’s susceptibility
to damage incurred by exposure to endo- and xenotoxins, carcinogens and their metabolites
whose transport is mediated by these proteins (5,12,41,54,65). several polymorphisms in  xxxg15xxx 
and mrp1 have recently been described in healthy japanese subjects but whether or not these
mutations result in differences in the substrate specificity of the encoded proteins is not yet
known (66). however, none of mutations described to date affect amino acids located in tm17
of either protein.
in summary, we have shown that trp1254 at the predicted cytoplasmic face of the last

residue in mrp1, is critical for the recognition and transport of e217betag. we have also shown
that, unlike mrp1-trp1246,  xxxg15xxx -trp1254 is important for ltc4 transport. finally, we have
identified trp1254 as being essential for the ability of  xxxg15xxx  to transport mtx. together with
previous studies, these findings demonstrate that this conserved trp residue plays a pivotal role
in the substrate specificity and transport capacity of both mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx , which suggests that
it is also likely to be important in other members of the abcc subfamily. the related
basolateral transporter,  xxxg16xxx , like mrp1 and  xxxg15xxx , can confer drug resistance and transport
conjugated organic anions but has its own distinctive pattern of tissue expression and substrate
specificity (67-72). experiments are in progress to examine the effect of trp1242 substitutions on
the transport activities of  xxxg16xxx .
