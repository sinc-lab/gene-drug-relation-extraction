caused by art, dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism,
abnormalities in adiponectin and leptin concentrations, alterations in glucocorticoid signaling, immune reconstitution, and impaired growth hormone secretion.3 for this last
pathophysiologic mechanism, recombinant human growth
hormone has been studied and vat reduction of 8.5-11%
has been observed in clinical trials.3 recombinant human
growth hormone has been approved by the food and drug
administration (fda) for aids-related wasting; however,
the doses required for the greatest reductions in vat
caused insulin resistance, arthralgias, carpal tunnel syndrome, and peripheral edema.8 this resulted in the development of  xxxd3320xxx , an analogue of growth hormone
releasing hormone ( xxxg892xxx ) that provides a different approach to the management of lipodystrophy in the hiv-infected individual.
 xxxd3320xxx  ( xxxd3320xxx ; manufactured by theratechnologies inc., montreal, quebec, canada; distributed by emd

phase 2 study

the phase 2 dose-finding study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind trial that assessed the efficacy of
 xxxd3320xxx  ( xxxd3320xxx ) 1 or 2 mg subcutaneously once daily versus placebo.12 participants (n = 61) were predominantly white men; 5% of subjects had diabetes at baseline.
treatment groups were similar at baseline in terms of use of
art and lipid-lowering therapies. mean age and cd4+ cell
count were 45 years and 548 cells/mm3, respectively. after
12 weeks, vat decreased in the placebo group and both
treatment groups compared to baseline (p = 0.03 for change
within group), but this change was not significant for
 xxxd3320xxx  compared to placebo (table 2).12 there were no
significant changes in sat. the vat-to-sat ratio was decreased more in the treatment groups than in the placebo
group, at –0.23, –0.14, and 0.01 for the 1-mg, 2-mg, and
placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.008 for 2 mg vs placebo;
p = 0.043 for 1 mg vs placebo). concentrations of igf-1 increased significantly compared to placebo (p < 0.01 for each
active group). there were no significant changes in or between treatment groups in fasting glucose and insulin. although  xxxd3320xxx  treatment did not significantly impact the
primary endpoint of vat change, the authors were encouraged by the positive impact of treatment on increasing igf-1
without compromising glycemic control.
phase 3 studies

 xxxd3320xxx  efficacy was evaluated for 26 weeks in 2
double-blind phase 3 studies.13,14 in both studies, patients
were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive  xxxd3320xxx  2 mg
daily or placebo. body composition parameters, with vat
as the primary outcome, biochemical indices, and glycemic parameters were measured. the impact of  xxxd3320xxx  on lipid parameters, fasting glucose, and igf-1 concentrations was determined (table 3). impact of  xxxd3320xxx 
on body image was determined with use of a questionnaire
attributed to phase v technologies (wellesley, ma).

in a phase 3 study (nct00123253), 410 patients received  xxxd3320xxx  or placebo.13 demographic and clinical
characteristics were similar between groups at baseline:
mean age was 47 years and most patients were white men.
fasting glucose was <110 mg/dl in 81% of the population
at baseline. significantly more patients in the treatment
group than in the placebo group received nonnucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (146 [53.7%] vs 57 patients
[41.6%]; p = 0.03); however, use of other arts was similar. overall study discontinuation rate was 20.5% (p = 0.12
between study groups). the primary reasons for discontinuation were consent withdrawal and adverse events. waist
circumference and vat were significantly decreased after
26 weeks of  xxxd3320xxx , with no overall change in bmi
(table 2). sat decreased by 0.4% in the  xxxd3320xxx  group
and increased by 1.7% in the placebo group (p = 0.05).
concentrations of igf-1 substantially increased (81%)
with treatment, without significantly affecting fasting glucose (table 3) or insulin. with respect to body image,
scores for “belly image distress” and “belly profile”
demonstrated statistically significant improvement in
 xxxd3320xxx - vs placebo-treated patients, but the difference
in “belly size” score was not statistically significant. adherence, determined by  xxxd3320xxx  vial count, was greater
than 98% in both groups.
in the other primary phase 3 study (nct00435136),
396 patients were randomized to receive  xxxd3320xxx  2 mg
or placebo.14 characteristics were similar between groups
at baseline, including utilization of various art drug
classes. approximately 57% of patients were on regimens
including protease inhibitors, 89% were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 37% were on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. over three
quarters of patients were white males. the discontinuation
rate was slightly higher in this study, at 26% (p = 0.71 between groups). the primary reasons for discontinuation
were consent withdrawal and adverse events. findings for

vealed benefit of treatment and were similar to the findings
in the previous phase 3 study. at 26 weeks, there were no
significant differences from baseline or between groups in
sat (p = 0.55). patients rated less belly appearance distress with  xxxd3320xxx  (p = 0.02), and physician belly profile rating demonstrated improvement (p = 0.02). in both
studies, treatment with  xxxd3320xxx  had positive impact
quantitatively and with some qualitative measures on visceral adiposity, without worsening glycemic control. the
authors suggest that the reduction in vat may improve
body image for hiv-infected patients. although reduction
in cardiovascular risk was not specifically studied, the authors suggest that there may be benefit to vat reduction,
given that increased vat is becoming recognized as a risk
factor for coronary heart disease. however, findings from
both trials have limited applicability to female or nonwhite
patients.
data from the first phase 3 study demonstrated the positive impact of  xxxd3320xxx  on lipid measures, but these
findings were not repeated in the second study (table 3).
therefore, the authors pooled the data from both studies
for further analysis (tables 2 and 3).15 baseline characteristics were similar between groups in all evaluated parameters. when data were stratified for sex or baseline art
regimen, efficacy in terms of vat reductions was maintained, meaning that there were no treatment-by-art or
treatment-by-sex interactions.
both 26-week studies had preplanned 26-week extension phases conducted for safety evaluation and duration of
effect.13,14,16 only patients completing the initial studies

with fasting glucose <150 mg/dl were eligible for the extension. at 26 weeks,  xxxd3320xxx -treated patients were
rerandomized to receive placebo or  xxxd3320xxx  (t-p, and
t-t, respectively), while patients treated with placebo initially then received  xxxd3320xxx  (p-t).14,16 in both extension
studies, vat benefits were maintained without adverse effects on glycemic or lipid control. however, the vat improvements in the initial 6 months were not sustained in
the t-p group. the percent changes from baseline in vat
at week 52 were 1.3% and –1.6% for the t-p groups in the
extension studies.14,16 in one extension study, there were no
significant differences between or within groups for sat at
52 weeks.14 in the other 52-week study, sat was reduced
by 1.6% over baseline in the t-t group (p < 0.05); other
sat comparisons were not statistically significant.16
clinical trials to date have focused on the reduction of
vat and belly fat with  xxxd3320xxx  use in hiv-associated
lipodystrophy. however, its effects on fat accumulation in
other areas are not known. investigators for an ongoing trial18 are planning to evaluate the effect of 6-12 months of
 xxxd3320xxx  on primary outcomes of liver fat as measured
by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and vat change.
secondary outcome measures of note include intramyocellular lipid of the calf, endogenous growth hormone secretion, and carotid intimal medial thickness. the investigators hypothesized that treatment with  xxxd3320xxx  will decrease liver and muscle fat accumulation without adversely
affecting glucose metabolism. information obtained from
this study might provide further efficacy and safety data to
support  xxxd3320xxx  use.

off-label uses

currently, the use of  xxxd3320xxx  is being assessed in a
number of clinical trials in disease states other than hivassociated lipodystrophy. a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial assessing the efficacy and safety of  xxxd3320xxx  in ambulatory patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and
muscle wasting began recruiting patients in september
2011.19 the primary endpoint of this trial will be to assess
the effect of  xxxd3320xxx  on lean body mass, while secondary endpoints include changes in exercise capacity, peripheral muscle strength, copd exacerbations, and plasma
glucose. another ongoing trial, smart (the somatotrophics, memory, and aging research trial), is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel assignment study of the efficacy and safety of  xxxd3320xxx  in healthy adults and those
with mild cognitive impairment.20 the outcome measure
will assess memory changes and cognitive function. this
trial began recruiting patients in early 2006, with an estimated date of completion of february 2012. previously,
the use of  xxxd3320xxx  was assessed in hip fracture recovery, immune responsiveness to influenza vaccination, sleep
maintenance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, the
full results of these trials have not been published, and
there has been no attempt to pursue phase 3 trials on these
potential indications.21
in summary, results from clinical trials in patients with
hiv-associated lipodystrophy demonstrated that treatment
with  xxxd3320xxx  for up to 52 weeks significantly reduced
vat 10-15% from baseline, with minimal clinical impact
on sat. the clinical significance of the degree of vat reduction is not well characterized. in addition, improvement
was observed in some qualitative parameters of belly fat
distribution as demonstrated by body image survey findings. both vat and sat have been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, although vat has been considered more pathogenic.22 insulin resistance and dyslipidemia associated with vat have been observed in both
hiv-positive and -negative subjects.5,6,22 therefore, vat
reduction without sat gain may theoretically reduce
metabolic risk, but additional sustained outcomes were not
evaluated. the findings of reduced distress related to body
composition may have potential implications for art adherence; however, more studies are required. improvements in vat with  xxxd3320xxx  were lost after 26 weeks in
the t-p study groups, so questions remain about the optimal duration of therapy.
safety and adverse events
a thorough evaluation of  xxxd3320xxx  safety must address discontinuation rates, relevant alterations of metabolic or biochemical indices, adverse effects, and potential for

antibody formation.  xxxd3320xxx  treatment for at least 26
weeks led to increased igf-1 concentrations without adversely affecting triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or fasting glucose (table 3).
 xxxd3320xxx  was generally well tolerated in clinical trials,
with similar rates of discontinuation versus placebo in
most studies.12-16 in the dose-ranging trial, 3 patients in the
2-mg group discontinued treatment because of rash,
arthralgia, and paresthesias.12 headaches were noted in
14% and 21% of subjects in the placebo and  xxxd3320xxx  1mg groups, respectively. anti- xxxd3320xxx  antibodies were
not found in any subjects during this 12-week study.
one phase 3 study (nct00123253) had similar overall
discontinuation rates between groups; however, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was higher in the
 xxxd3320xxx  group compared to the placebo group (12.1%
vs 2.9%; p = 0.002).13 headache and arthralgias were the
most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse
events (>10%), with rates similar in both groups.  xxxd3320xxx  was discontinued in 6 patients with urticaria reactions
extending beyond the injection site. one of these patients
developed systemic reactions that resolved spontaneously.
anti- xxxd3320xxx  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies
were detected in those 6 patients, and in 48.6% and 2.7%
of patients in the  xxxd3320xxx  and placebo groups, respectively. during the extension phase, 9 serious adverse
events, including 2 deaths, occurred in  xxxd3320xxx -treated
patients. the deaths were due to coronary artery disease in
a patient with preexisting history of disease, and complications of tonsillectomy in the other patient.13,16 the investigators did not attribute the deaths or serious events to treatment.16 at 1 year, anti- xxxd3320xxx  igg antibodies were detected in 53.7%, 21.1%, and 67.5% of the t-t, t-p, and
p-t participants, respectively. all patients with urticarial
reactions, except for 1, had anti- xxxd3320xxx  igg antibodies. antibody titer levels were not correlated with changes
in vat or igf-1, so the authors suggested that the antibodies were unlikely to be neutralizing. however, the clinical
significance of the antibodies and the extent of antibody
disappearance require further study.
 xxxd3320xxx  was well tolerated, with similar rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation and overall adverse
events in the other primary phase 3 study (nct00435136)
and its extension.14 the most commonly reported adverse
events (>10%) were injection site erythema, pruritus, and
arthralgia. two deaths were reported: 1 from lung cancer
in the  xxxd3320xxx  group, and 1 from arrhythmias in the
placebo group. at 52 weeks, hypersensitivity skin reactions were observed in 1.1%, 0%, and 3.5% of participants
in the t-t, t-p, and p-t groups, respectively. similarly to
the other phase 3 study extension, there was no impact of
anti- xxxd3320xxx  antibodies on vat or  xxxg1144xxx  responses at
week 52.

 xxxd3320xxx : a growth hormone–releasing factor analogue for hiv-associated lipodystrophy

the possible impact of  xxxd3320xxx  on progression to diabetes is a potential area of concern. in a pooled analysis of
data from the 2 phase 3 trials, mean hemoglobin a1c (a1c)
increased by 0.14% and 0.02% at 26 weeks in tesamorelintreated and placebo-treated patients, respectively (p <
0.001).15 although impact on a1c is not again discussed
in the published clinical trials, the  xxxd3320xxx  prescribing
information provides data about diabetes risk.9 in the phase
3 studies, more  xxxd3320xxx -treated patients developed
a1c of 6.5% or greater (4.5% vs 1.3% in placebo-treated
patients). an odds ratio of 3.3 (ci 1.4 to 9.6) for developing diabetes with treatment is provided by the manufacturer.
finally, further studies of  xxxd3320xxx  have been conducted to evaluate effects on biochemical parameters17 and
endogenous growth hormone pulsatility.23 stanley and colleagues17 reviewed the impact of  xxxd3320xxx  on inflammatory markers using a previously described cohort.13 endogenous concentrations of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1, tissue plasminogen activator (tpa), c-reactive
protein, and adiponectin were measured at 26 weeks.17
treatment with  xxxd3320xxx  decreased tpa antigen, which
the authors suggest may result from the favorable body
composition changes.  xxxd3320xxx  2 mg daily for 2 weeks
was administered subcutaneously to 13 healthy males for
evaluation of growth hormone pulsatility and insulin sensitivity.23 the investigators hypothesized that the effects of
 xxxd3320xxx  on endogenous growth hormone would not adversely affect insulin sensitivity. after 2 weeks of
 xxxd3320xxx , and 2 weeks later, mean growth hormone and
igf-1 concentrations increased as expected, but insulinstimulated glucose uptake was not changed. the overall
clinical significance of these physiologic effects of
 xxxd3320xxx  requires further study.

center resource located on the product’s web page.24 additionally, the axis center provides reimbursement assistance to determine if a patient’s insurance benefits provide
access to  xxxd3320xxx  as well as financial assistance in the
form of a patient assistance program and co-pay program.
the program also supplies patient education kits, in-office
or at-home injection training, ongoing product support, and
adherence assessment.
use in special populations
 xxxd3320xxx  has not been studied in adults older than 65
with hiv-associated lipodystrophy.9 its use has not been
assessed in pediatric patients; the product labeling notes
that it should not be used in children with open epiphyses,
as this could result in excessive growth.9 in the new drug
application approval letter for  xxxd3320xxx , the fda
waived the pediatric study requirement because of this
concern.25  xxxd3320xxx  is pregnancy category x, as altering vat during pregnancy could result in harm to the fetus, including the potential for hydrocephaly that was observed in fetal rats.9 it is unknown whether  xxxd3320xxx  is
excreted into human milk; however, breast feeding is discouraged in order to avoid potential transmission of hiv
as well as possible adverse effects for the infant. no dosing
recommendations are provided for patients with renal or
hepatic impairment, owing to a lack of data.
economic considerations

dosage and administration
 xxxd3320xxx  is fda approved only for the reduction of
excess abdominal fat in hiv-infected individuals with
lipodystrophy, at a dose of 2 mg subcutaneously once daily
in the abdomen, rotating injection sites and avoiding scar
tissue, bruises, and the navel.9  xxxd3320xxx  is available as a
sterile, lyophilized powder that is white to off-white. it is
supplied in a package containing 2 boxes; the medication
box contains sixty 1-mg vials of  xxxd3320xxx  for injection
(requiring refrigeration) and the injection box contains 30
single-use 10-ml vials of sterile water for injection, usp,
as diluent, disposable syringes, and needles (stored at room
temperature).
patient counseling for  xxxd3320xxx  should include review
of the reconstitution method detailed in the patient instruction leaflet provided in the product packages. each dose necessitates reconstitution of two 1-mg vials of  xxxd3320xxx 
with 1 vial of diluent. the vials should be rolled gently betheannals.com

one of the primary concerns with  xxxd3320xxx  is its high
price; the average wholesale price of a 1-month supply is
$2357.28, translating to an annual cost of $28,287.36.26 considering that the management of hiv-associated lipodystrophy could be lifelong, as changes in vat observed with
 xxxd3320xxx  are reversed once the drug is discontinued, this
may result in an extremely large economic burden for health
plans and patients. additionally, since there is a lack of safety data beyond 1 year of treatment, it is questionable how
long patients should continue to receive therapy with
 xxxd3320xxx , and for how long health plans should continue
to pay for it. the initial onset of effect of this agent appears
to be within the first 3-6 months of initiation; if no benefit is
observed after 6 months of treatment, it would be reasonable
to discontinue it. ideally, strict prior authorization criteria are
needed to ensure appropriate initial and continued use, especially considering the potential for off-label uses that have
not been studied adequately at this time.

summary
clinical trial data with  xxxd3320xxx  prove this agent to be
potentially effective and safe when used to treat hiv-associated lipodystrophy. however, in addition to the economic
controversies, there are additional questions yet to be answered. currently, this agent has not been proven to reduce
the risk of poor outcomes related to lipodystrophy. also,
there are no data indicating that adherence with art is enhanced when body image is improved with  xxxd3320xxx . the
lack of safety data beyond 1 year of treatment is concerning,
as there could be long-term cardiovascular or endocrine adverse effects that arise with long-term use. studies assessing
these outcomes will be needed to gain a better understanding
of the place in therapy of this agent. overall, its benefits of reducing central adiposity and improving lipid profiles make it
an important option to consider for patients who experience
lipodystrophy associated with hiv infection.

 xxxd3320xxx : a growth hormone–releasing factor analogue for hiv-associated lipodystrophy

el tratamiento de lipodistrofia asociada a la infección por el virus de
inmunodeficiencia humana (vih).
fuentes de información: la literatura se obtuvo a través de medline
(1948-noviembre 2011) y de abstractos farmacéuticos internacionales
(1970-octubre 2011) utilizando los términos  xxxd3320xxx ,  xxxd3320xxx ,
factor de liberación de la hormona de crecimiento, y síndrome de
lipodistrofia asociada a vih. se obtuvieron publicaciones adicionales a
través de las referencias dentro de las publicaciones de la literatura
primaria así como de lugares pertinentes en la web (internet).
selección y extracción de información: todos los artículos
identificados de las fuentes de información fueron evaluados y toda la
información pertinente fue incluida. todos los estudios relevantes a la
evaluación de la eficacia y seguridad de  xxxd3320xxx  en el manejo de
lipodistrofia asociada a vih fueron incluidos, con énfasis en los estudios
completados en humanos.
síntesis: en los 2 estudios clínicos fase iii y su análisis agregado,
 xxxd3320xxx  demostró disminuir significativamente la circunferencia de
la cintura y el tejido adiposo visceral (tav) luego de 26 semanas de
tratamiento. ambos estudios también demostraron mejoría significativa
en algunos parámetros subjetivos de la imagen corporal. ambos estudios
tuvieron fases de extensión de 26 semanas las cuales confirmaron el
mantenimiento de la mejoría en tav sin impactar negativamente los
parámetros de glucosa y lípidos. al momento, hay información limitada
para usos no aprobados por fda para  xxxd3320xxx .
conclusiones:  xxxd3320xxx  es efectivo en mejorar la adiposidad visceral
y la imagen corporal en pacientes con lipodistrofia asociada a vih a
través de 26-52 semanas de tratamiento. limitaciones potenciales para
su uso incluyen su alto costo y la falta de información sobre la seguridad
y adherencia a largo plazo.  xxxd3320xxx  provee una opción de
tratamiento para el manejo de lipodistrofia significativa relacionada a
infección con vih.

une recherche a été effectuée dans la base de données
informatisée medline (1948-novembre 2011) et international
pharmaceutique résumé (1970-octobre 2011) à l’aide des mots-clé
tésamoréline,  xxxd3320xxx , facteur de libération de l’hormone de croissance,
et syndrome de lipodystrophie associée au vih. les références
bibliographiques d’intérêt citées dans ces articles ainsi que celles
obtenues via des sites web pertinents ont aussi été incluses.
sélection des études et de l’information: tous les articles de langue
anglaise identifiés par la recherche ont été évalués et toute l’information
pertinente a été retenue. toutes les études pertinentes à l’évaluation de
l’efficacité et l’innocuité de la tésamoréline pour le traitement de la
lipodystrophie associée au vih ont été incluses, en mettant l’accent sur
les essais effectués chez l’humain.
synthese des données: dans 2 essais cliniques de phase iii et dans les
analyses des données regroupées, la tésamoréline a montré une
diminution significative du tour de taille et du tissu adipeux viscéral
après 26 semaines de traitement. les 2 essais ont aussi montré des
améliorations dans des paramètres subjectifs de l’image corporelle. dans
des phases d’extension de 26 semaines de ces études, on a montré le
maintien des améliorations sur la diminution du tissu adipeux viscéral
sans impact négatif sur la glycémie et le bilan lipidique. peu de données
supportent actuellement l’utilisation hors indication officielle de la
tésamoréline.
conclusions: la tésamoréline est efficace pour améliorer l’adiposité
viscérale et l’image corporelle lors de lipodystrophie chez les patients
infectés par le vih jusqu’à 26-52 semaines de traitement. les
limitations potentielles de son utilisation sont le coût élevé de traitement,
le manque de données sur l’innocuité à long terme et sur l’adhésion au
traitement. la tésamoréline est une alternative de traitement utile pour
les patients présentant des lipodystrophies significatives associées à
l’infection par le vih.
