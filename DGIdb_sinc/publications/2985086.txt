abstract--the equilibrium dissociation constants (ka) and maximal binding capacities of tritiated

 xxxd1888xxx  (dhm), [d-ala2,d-leus]enkephalin (dadle), ethylketocyclazocine (ekc) and
human ,6-endorphin (,6-ep) in rabbit cerebellum and brain membranes have been investigated. binding
of tritiated dhm and dadle was adequately described by a single affinity class of binding sites, while
that of ekc required two affinity sites. binding of tritiated/3-ep was also consistent with a single affinity
class of binding sites by scatchard analysis, but inhibition of the binding with type selective opiate
receptor ligands revealed multiple sites. sequential displacement of a broad spectrum opiate ligand,
 xxxd1913xxx  (dip), by type selective ligands showed that cerebellum membranes are relatively rich
in g (40%) and deficient in ~c(12%) binding sites, while brain membranes are relatively rich in ~c(32%)
and deficient in ~ (12%) binding sites. ~ep displaces 88 and 73% of tritiated dip from cerebellum and
brain membranes, respectively, suggesting multiple sites of ~ep binding.

the existence of multiple opiate receptors in the
mammalian brain has been well documented [1-5].
however, there are few studies on the opiate binding
sites in cerebellum of mammals except lagomorphs
[6, 7]. we recently reported that rabbit cerebellum
possesses abundant high affinity binding sites for/3ep? [8]. in view of the unique function and neuronal
architecture of cerebellum, it is of interest to determine the binding characteristics of various opiate
receptors in this tissue. the present study was conducted to disclose the spectrum of p, 6, i< and fl-ep
sites and their binding profiles in rabbit cerebellum
and brain.

winthrop and the upjohn co. respectively. bsa
was from schwarz/mann and bacitracin from sigma.
 xxxg1383xxx  was isolated from bovine brain
as described [11].

membranes
cerebellum and brain were dissected from 5 to
7 lb male new zealand rabbits, homogenized with a
polytron (brinkmann pt-20) (setting 6.5, 20 sec) in
10 vol. of tris-hc1 buffer (50 mm, ph 7.4), centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min, and washed as described
previously [8]. washed membranes were stored at
-700 at a concentration of 5 mg protein/ml in 20%
glycerol, 50 mm tris-hc1, ph 7.4. membrane protein was estimated by the method of lowry et al.
[121.

materials and methods

labeled compounds
[3h]-/3-ep (50ci/mmole) was prepared by catalytic reduction of the appropriate iodinated synthetic
analog as described previously [9]. [3h]dhm (72 ci/
mmole), [3h]dadle (44 ci/mmole), and [3h]ekc
(16ci/mmole) were from new england nuclear.
[3h]dip (7.5ci/mmole) was from amersham/
searle. purity of these 3h-ligands was checked using
reverse phase hplc.
unlabeled compounds and reagents
/3-ep was a synthetic product [10].  xxxd2670xxx  was from mallinckrodt and d a d l e from

binding experiments
all binding experiments were carried out in plastic
tubes with an assay buffer consisting of 0.1% bsa,
0.01% bacitracin, and 50 mm tris-hcl at ph 7.4.
the order of addition of reagents to tubes was assay
buffer, competing ligands (if any), the labeled ligand
and membranes. in most experiments, 0.5 mg of the
membrane protein was incubated in a final volume
of 2.0 ml for 60 min at 23 °. binding was terminated
by rapid vacuum filtration through whatman gf/b
glass fiber filters. the filters were then washed twice
with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (assay buffer
without bacitracin), transferred to vials containing
3 ml of scintillation fluid, and allowed to stand overnight at 23 °. when using [3h]-/3-ep as primary ligand.
the gf/b filters were pretreated with myelin basic
protein as described previously [13, 14]. radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. specific binding was determined by the difference in radioactivity trapped on filters in the
presence and absence of a 1.0 um concentration of
the corresponding unlabeled ligand.
sequential displacement was performed by meas-

plus 1 #m d a d l e , 100 nm morphine plus i # m
d a d l e plus 100 nm ekc, and 100 nm/3-ep. the
fraction which was displaced by morphine was taken
as the # site. the further displacement achieved by
the addition of d a d l e was assumed to represent
the 6 site. the difference between displacement with
morphine + d a d l e and with morphine + d a d l e
+ ekc was assumed to represent the k site. nonspecific binding was defined as binding remaining in
the presence of morphine, d a d l e , ekc, a n d / ~ ep together at the concentration given above. this
method was suggested by pfeiffer et al. [15] to estimate receptor type densities in human brain. since
d a d l e is not very specific for 6 sites, the estimate
for 6 site density is obtained from differences in
binding in the presence of morphine, with or without
d a d l e , rather than from d a d l e alone. the estimate for ~csite density is also obtained by differences
in binding. this approach avoids the problem of lack
of ligand selectivity by first using the most selective
ligand alone, then in combination with a less selective
ligand.

least squares method as described above, taking the
plateau region to be maximal binding. the apparent
affinity obtained is a function of receptor density as
well as receptor affinity.

data analysis

characterization of binding sites by competition
experiments
[3h]dhm. in cerebellum, [3h]dhm labeled a

saturation experiments were analyzed by
unweighted linear least squares regression of the
ratio of specific binding to free labeled ligand against
specific binding of the ligand (scatchard analysis).
initial estimates for nonlinear scatchard plots were
obtained as described [161 . competition experiments
were analyzed by weighted nonlinear least squares
analysis of a four parameter (ics0, slope, minimal
and maximal bound) logistic model. some of the
ligands showed heterogeneous curves in competition
experiments, as indicated by shallow slopes and poor
fit to a four parameter logistic model. in particular,
the displacement curve of [3h]dhm and [3h]ekc
by /3-ep in cerebellum was characterized by two
distinct components. for these two curves,* the
apparent k~ was calculated from the ic50 of the lower
portion of the curve. this was computed by the

* analysis of these curves and others in this data set by
the model of mass action as implemented by munson and
rodbard [17] has not, to date, proven possible (the data
appear to be inadequately fit by this model). for this
reason, analysis of relative affinities by ics,~is retained.

results

binding characteristics obtained by saturation analysis
table 1 presents the kd values and binding capacity
of various tritiated ligands in rabbit cerebellum and
brain. binding of [3h]dhm and [3h]dadle was
adequately described by a single affinity class of sites
by scatchard analysis. the binding of [3h]ekc was
found to be multiphasic (fig. 1); only the high affinity
site is shown in table 1. binding of [3h]-/3-ep was
monophasic; however, binding site heterogeneity
was revealed by kinetics of dissociation [8] and by
inhibition of binding by prototype opiate ligands (see
figs. 2 and 5). the apparent affinity of dhm. ekc,
and fl-ep was higher in cerebellum than in brain.
cerebellum also had a larger binding capacity than
brain, most prominently for dhm (tt opiate
receptor).

population of binding sites which could be displaced
completely by ekc and fl-ep, and nearly completely
displaced (98% inhibition) by d a d l e at a concentration of 1 ,um, as shown in fig. 2a. u-50488, a
compound reported to be a specific k ligand [18],
showed weak but complete inhibition of [3h]dhm
binding at a concentration of 40 um-/3-ep inhibited
[3h]dhm binding with the highest potency. its completion curve was biphasic, with a plateau at 65%
inhibition. the apparent inhibition constant (k,) of
the higher affinity phase was estimated to be lower
than 0.1 pm. this apparent high affinity site for flep had not been detected by saturation analysis and
could be due to the slow dissociation of/3-ep from
the binding site as has been reported previously [8].
the apparent k, values of all ligands tested are given
in table 2. the value for morphine agrees well with
its apparent kj obtained from saturation analysis. in
brain all ligands, including [3-ep, showed a simple,
monophasic competition curve (fig. 2b). the order
of potency is similar to that in cerebellar membranes
(i.e.
[3-ep > ekc > morphine > d a d l e > u-

fig. 1. saturation analysis of binding of [3h]ekc to cerebellar (0) and brain (c)) membranes of the rabbit. data
shown are from one of three replicate experiments. in
cerebellar membranes, the ka and binding capacity are
0.24 nm and 208 fmoles/mg for the high affinity site and
1.27 nm and 235 fmoles/mg for the low affinity site. in brain
membrane, the kd and binding capacity are 0.95 nm and
229 fmoles/mg for the high affinity site, and 3.1 nm and
381 fmoles/mg for the low affinity site respectively.

50488). however, all ligands had lower affinity
(higher ki value) in brain (table 2), and dadlie
and u-50488 did not completely displace [3h]dhm
binding at concentrations of 1.0 and 40 !~m respectively. it is interesting to find that ekc, a c o m p o u n d
claimed to be a ,v specific ligand, showed a three to
four times higher potency than morphine in displacing [3h]dhm.
[3h]dadle. as summarized in table 3, the
apparent ki for d a d l e calculated from competition experiments was 2.0 -+ 0.2 in cerebellum and
1.7 +-0.3 in brain membranes. these values agree
well with those obtained from saturation experiments. opioid peptides and opiates displaced [3h]d a d l e binding in cerebellar m e m b r a n e s (fig. 3)
with a relative potency similar to that found in displacement of [3h]dhm (table 3). in brain
m e m b r a n e , however, e k c and morphine showed a
marked increased in apparent k i values so that the
order of potency changed to fi-ep > d a d l e >
e k c > morphine > u-50488. morphine and u50488 were unable to completely displace {3hjd a d l e binding in both cerebellum and brain membranes (fig. 3). the lower apparent affinity of d h m
and e k c in brain may be attributed in part to the
relatively low content of the/,~ binding site in brain
(see below) to which d h m and e k c bind with high
affinity.
[3h]ekc. the opiate binding sites labeled by [3h]e k c could not be displaced completely by all other
ligands tested. even fl-ep showed a flat, incomplete

fl-ep can bind a large n u m b e r of binding sites,
amounting to 3 5 0 - 8 f m o l e s / m g protein in cerebellum and 272 +- 9 fmoles/mg protein in brain [8].
the apparent kd values determined by saturation
experiments in cerebellum and brain were 0.28 and
0 . 4 5 n m respectively. competition studies in cerebellum revealed that m o r p h i n e and e k c had similar potencies in displacing [3h]-fl-ep binding (ki =
1.71 and 1.96 respectively), while d a d l e was about
two times less potent than morphine (fig. 5b and
table 5). in brain m e m b r a n e s , morphine, d a d l e
and e k c showed similar apparent ki values against
[3h]-fl-ep (fig. 5b and table 5), while u-50488

displaced with a ki value as high as 959 nm. it is
surprising that morphine could displace more than
90% and d a d l e completely displace fl-ep binding
in both brain and cerebellum, although the n u m b e r
of binding sites for d h m or d a d l e determined by
scatchard analysis was always less than for fl-ep.

the capacity of binding. using sequential displacement of [3h]dip (an opiate ligand reported to
bind all types of opiate receptors in brain [19], the
relative content of/~, 6 and ,v receptors was estimated
to be 40, 37, and 12% respectively, in cerebellum
and 12, 37 and 32, respectively, in brain (table 6).
~ e p displaced 88% of [3h]dip binding in cerebellum and 73% in brain; these values appear to
equal the sum of displacement of all three types of
receptors (/*, 6 and k). the relative deficiency in
receptors in brain is consistent with the data obtained
from saturation analysis (see table 1). the relative
content (%) of /~ and 6 receptors in cerebellum
and brain obtained by either saturation analysis or
sequential displacement is fairly close. values of
42% for/~, 33% for 6 sites in cerebellum and 19%
for /~, 39% for 6 sites in brain were obtained by
dividing the maximal binding capacity (table 1) by
the total [3h]dip bound. due to the rather broad
spectrum of ekc binding, the capacity of its high
affinity site shown in table 1 probably represents the
sum of its binding to k as well as kt sites. high affinity
binding of ekc to/~ and ,v sites has been shown in
this (see tables 3 and 4) and other reports [20, 21].

it has been reported that low temperature and
na ÷ inhibit binding of [3h]ekc to/~ and 6 receptors
but enhance binding to k receptor [22]. therefore,
one would expect binding to decrease in brain areas
rich in # and 6, and to increase in areas rich in k and
deficient in/~ on adding na +. at 23°, 100 mm na +
reduced [3h]ekc binding to 48% of control in cerebellum but increased binding to 110% of the control
in brain. at 5°, 100 mm na + reduced [3h]ekc binding to 17.5% in cerebellum and 32.2% in brain,
relative to control (23 °, no na+). these values are
similar to those determined by sequential displacement (table 6).
discussion

the maximal binding capacity and relative content
of various types of opiate binding sites differ between
rabbit brain and cerebellum as shown by both saturation and sequential displacement methods. cerebellum is rich in y and 6 and deficient in k while
brain is rich in k and 6 but deficient in y. these

opiate receptor in rabbit cerebellum
findings are consistent with changes in binding
capacity resulting from changes in incubation temperature and na* concentration.
competition experiments showed marked differences in ligand binding profile between these two
membrane preparations. in brain membranes, the
binding sites labeled by [3h]dhm (/*), [3h]dadle
(6) and [3h]ekc ( k + / , ) show highest affinity to
morphine, d a d l e and ekc respectively (table
7), while in cerebellar membranes/~ sites have the
same affinity to both morphine and d a d l e , and 6
sites show the same affinity to d a d l e and
morphine, or even higher affinity to morphine. ekc
which should have high affinity to r< and ,u sites also
shows high affinity to the 6 site. since the relative
content of the 6 site is the same in brain and in
cerebellum, the differences in apparent binding affinity (ki) to prototype ligands suggest a preponderance
of ~usites in rabbit cerebellum. meunier [7] suggests
that y sites account for 80% of opiate receptor sites
in rabbit cerebellum, on the basis of competition for
[3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding. however, sequential displacement of dip by selective ligands indicates only
40% of ~usites.
the proportions of/t, 6, and ~:sites found in rabbit
cerebellum by sequential displacement were quite
similar to those reported in rat brain [19, 23] while
the proportions found in rabbit brain were close to
those reported in guinea pig brain [24, 25].
from binding capacity data determined by saturation with labeled ligands or sequential displacement,/3-ep sites appear to be approximately the sum
of p, 6 and k sites. this suggests that, ~ e p can
interact with all three receptors. however, saturation
analysis gave a single ka for/3-ep which indicates
that the fl-ep binds to different sites with similar
affinity. this conclusion is supported by the present
findings that ekc, d a d l e and morphine displaced
[3h]-fi-ep with similar ki values in brain and cerebellum (see table 5) despite the large difference in
receptor types composition.
after completing this manuscript, we noted the
related publication of meunier et al. [26]. although
different methods of analysis and different labeled
compounds were used, both meunier et al. [26] and
we agree that there are approximately 3-fold higher
levels of f2 receptors in rabbit cerebellum than in
brain, and approximately a 3-fold lower level of k
receptors in cerebellum than in brain. our results
indicate a substantial amount of 6 receptors in both
brain and cerebellum, while they indicate that the 6
receptor is negligible. further work will be required
to clarify the status of 6 receptors in rabbit cerebellum and brain.
