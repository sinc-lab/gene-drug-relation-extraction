abstract
1,25(oh)2 d3 regulates calcium homeostasis through its actions in the intestine, bone, and kidney. these actions are mediated through the
vdr. to determine if vdr’s actions in the proximal small intestine can sufficiently restore calcium homeostasis, we generated transgenic
mice expressing hvdr exclusively in the duodenum of mvdr-null mice by using the  xxxg62xxx  enhancer (hvdr+/mvdr-null).
unlike wild-type mice, hvdr+/mvdr-null mice express hvdr and vdr target genes only in the proximal small intestine. despite having
functional hvdr in the proximal small intestine, hvdr+/mvdr-null mice were hypocalcaemic when fed a normal rodent diet at weaning,
like mvdr-null mice fed the same diet. the hypocalcemia in these mice is prevented if they are given the rescue diet before weaning.
however, when 90-day-old rachitic mice were fed a rescue diet, serum calcium improved in hvdr+/mvdr-null mice, but not in mvdr-null
mice. in conclusion, transgenic hvdr in the proximal small intestine of hvdr+/mvdr-null mice was transcriptionally active and regulated
calcium absorption, but vdr actions elsewhere in the intestine are probably necessary to support adequate calcium homeostasis. in addition,
hvdr+/mvdr-null mice responded better to the late rescue diet suggesting that expression of vdr in the proximal small intestine protected
the calcium absorbing machinery from age-dependent decline.

1. introduction
david schachter and colleagues first reported the connection between 1,25(oh)2 d3 (the active form of vitamin
d) and intestinal calcium absorption in the 1960s [2]. they
determined that calcium could be actively transported against
its concentration gradient and that this event was highly
dependent on 1,25(oh)2 d3 [2]. marcus and lengemann
ascertained that the duodenum (followed by the jejunum
and ileum) has the fastest rate of calcium absorption [2].
this is significant because duodenal calcium absorption is
dependent on 1,25(oh)2 d3 [11].
1,25(oh)2 d3 regulates calcium absorption in the small
intestine by binding the  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr), a

nuclear receptor and transcription factor [1]. this binding
leads to conformation changes in the vdr that promote
heterodimerization with the retinoid x receptor (rxr)
[1]. the 1,25(oh)2 d3 –vdr–rxr complex translocates to
the nucleus where it binds  xxxd2019xxx  response element/s
(vdres) usually located on the dna upstream of the transcription start site [1]. this vdr complex can then regulate
gene transcription [1].
the vdr-null mice have proven valuable in revealing
many unexplored functions of the vdr and in confirming its
importance in regulating calcium homeostasis. indeed, the
vdr-null mice develop rickets, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated serum 1,25(oh)2 d3 , and hyperparathyroidism [3]. furthermore, active duodenal calcium absorption
in 60-day-old vdr-null mice was reduced by 70% compared
to wild-type (wt) mice and this reduction was accompanied
by a decrease in expression of genes associated with this

physiological action, namely, ecac2 and calbindin d9k [5].
in spite of this evidence for decrease in active calcium absorption, feeding the vdr-null mice a diet high in calcium (2%),
phosphorus (1.25%), and lactose (20%) starting at 16 days
of age was sufficient to prevent the hypocalcemia, bone disease, growth retardation, and hyperparathyroidism without
restoring active duodenal calcium absorption [4]. therefore,
these studies did not establish a physiological necessity for
vdr-regulated active calcium absorption.
to determine the contribution of vdr-regulated active
calcium absorption (primarily executed by the duodenum and
proximal jejunum) to overall calcium homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice expressing the hvdr exclusively in
the duodenum and proximal jejunum of mvdr-null mice by
using the duodenal-specific enhancer fragment of the  xxxg62xxx  (ada) gene [6,7].

highest level of hvdr expression in the intestine was chosen
for further studies.
2.3. detection of transcriptionally active hvdr
transgenic mice were analyzed for induction of 24hydroxylase (cyp24) mrna by an intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection of 1,25(oh)2 d3 (3 ␮g/kg) 6 h before sacrifice [8].
total rna was extracted from intestinal mucosa using trireagent and cdna produced by rt was analyzed using
semi-q pcr and primers specific for cyp24 [8].
2.4. analysis of serum calcium
cardiac puncture was performed on mice after they had
been sacrificed by asphyxiation. total calcium was measured
in serum samples using the cobas integra® 400 plus
(roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in).

2. materials and methods
2.5. animal maintenance
2.1. generation of transgenic mice
the psi mammalian expression vector (promega, madison, wi) was used as a backbone for the construct of the
wt hvdr transgene. the sv40 enhancer was removed and
the ada enhancer (a kind gift of dr. d.a. wiginton, university of cincinnati) [6,7] was inserted upstream of the
original enhancer site. the wt hvdr was introduced into a
multiple cloning cassette. restriction analysis confirmed the
correct orientation of the hvdr. the ada/hvdr/poly(a)
cassette was isolated from the psi vector and injected into
the pronuclei of fertilized b6d2f1/j mouse oocytes. potential founders were identified by pcr of tail dna using
hvdr-specific primers that do not recognize the mvdr
[9]. three potential founders were mated to wt littermates
to obtain offspring heterozygous for hvdr transgene integration (hvdr+/mvdr+/+). mice heterozygous for hvdr
were then bred with mvdr-null mice (a kind gift of dr. m.b.
demay, harvard medical school) [3,4] to generate mice heterozygous for both hvdr and mvdr (hvdr+/mvdr+).
heterozygous mice were then bred with mvdr-null mice to
generate mice heterozygous for hvdr and null for mvdr
(hvdr+/mvdr-null).

mice were housed in a conventional specific pathogen free
(cspf) facility and exposed to a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle.
mice were fed either a normal rodent diet from labdiet
(5001, pmi® nutrition international, richmond, in) composed of 0.95% calcium and 0.67% phosphorus or a rescue
diet from harlan teklad (td-96348, harlan teklad global
diets® , madison, wi) composed of 2% calcium, 1.25% phosphorus, and 20% lactose.

3. results
3.1. assessment of hvdr transgene expression
hvdr expression was initially assessed in hvdr+/
mvdr+ mice and later assessed in hvdr+/mvdr-null

2.2. analysis of transgene expression
in order to determine level of hvdr mrna and tissues where it is expressed, total rna was extracted from
intestine, kidney, liver, and spleen using tri-reagent (sigma,
st. louis, mo). intestinal tissue was analyzed by removing
2 cm segments starting with the segment most adjacent to the
pyloric sphincter and ending with the cecum. cdna produced
by reverse transcriptase (rt) was analyzed using semiquantitative (semi-q) pcr and transgene-specific primers
that distinguished spliced hvdr mrna from genomic
hvdr or mvdr mrna. the transgenic line that had the

mice. in the transgenic mice tested, hvdr expression was
localized to the proximal small intestine, namely small
intestinal segments 2 and 3 (fig. 1a). these segments represent the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. there was
no detectable hvdr mrna in the distal gi (ileum, cecum)
or in kidney, spleen, or liver.
3.2. assessment of cyp24 expression
cyp24 expression was analyzed in wt and hvdr+/
mvdr-null mice after i.p. injection of 1,25(oh)2 d3
(fig. 1b). wt mice had robust expression of cyp24 mrna;
expression was apparent in the proximal small intestine (segments 1 and 2) as well as in the cecum. cyp24 expression in
hvdr+/mvdr-null mice was visible in the proximal small
intestine (segments 1, 2, and 3), but not in the cecum.
3.3. serum calcium measurements
60-day-old female and male wt mice had serum calcium levels of 10 ± 0.47 mg/dl when kept on a normal
diet (fig. 2a). this value was significantly higher than that
of age- and sex-matched mvdr-null and hvdr+/mvdrnull mice, which had serum calcium values of 6.1 ± 0.70
and 7.1 ± 1.2 mg/dl, respectively. normal calcium homeostasis was restored in these mice if they were given
the rescue diet before weaning [4]. on this diet, mvdrnull mice had serum calcium levels of 10.3 ± 0.76 mg/dl
and hvdr+/mvdr-null mice had serum calcium levels
of 10.6 ± 1.5 mg/dl (fig. 2a). however, if the rescue diet
was given to 90-day-old mice for 3 consecutive weeks
and not at weaning, mvdr-null mice remained hypocalcaemic with serum calcium levels of 7.3 ± 1.2 mg/dl,
but hvdr+/mvdr-null mice became normocalcaemic
and had serum calcium values of 11.7 ± 1.6 mg/dl
(fig. 2b).

4. discussion
hvdr+/mvdr-null mice expressed transcriptionally
active hvdr only in the proximal small intestine. because a

normal rodent diet cannot maintain adequate calcium homeostasis in these mice, we concluded that vdr actions in other
parts of the intestine are probably necessary to support this
process. according to wasserman [2], a large portion of calcium is transported in the jejunum (23%) and ileum (62%) by
passive mechanisms; perhaps, the vdr plays an important
role in this process.
the hvdr+/mvdr-null mice responded better to the rescue diet at 90 days than the mvdr-null mice suggesting
that vdr-mediated active calcium absorption is necessary
under nutritional and physiological conditions when calcium
absorption is inadequate. for example, inadequate calcium
absorption develops in aging rodents and in man as their calcium absorbing machinery declines [10] and in inflammatory
bowel disease when the distal gastrointestinal tract becomes
obstructed leading to insufficient calcium absorption [12].
the expression of hvdr in the proximal small intestine of
mvdr-null mice protected their calcium absorbing machinery from age-dependent decline. these mice can be further
used to identify approaches to enhance  xxxd2019xxx -regulated
calcium absorption in the proximal small intestine to compensate for obstruction of calcium absorption in the distal
intestine.
