summary: purpose: we investigated the effect of the new
antiepileptic drug (aed)  xxxd2466xxx  (lev) on different
types of high-voltage–activated (hva) ca2+ channels in
freshly isolated ca1 hippocampal neurons of rats.
methods: patch-clamp recordings of hva ca2+ channel activity were obtained from isolated hippocampal ca1 neurons.
lev was applied by gravity flow from a pipette placed near the
cell, and solution changes were made by electromicrovalves.
ca2+ channel blockers were used for separation of the channel
subtypes.
results: the currents were measured in controls and after
application of 1–200 ␮m lev. lev irreversibly inhibited the
hva calcium current by ∼18% on the average. with a prepulse
stimulation protocol, which can eliminate direct inhibition of
ca2+ channels by g proteins, we found that g proteins were not
involved in the pathways underlying the lev inhibitory effect.
this suggested that the inhibitory effect arises from a direct

action of lev on the channel molecule. the blocking mechanism of lev was not related to changes in steady-state activation or inactivation of ca2+ channels. lev also did not
influence the rundown of the hva ca2+ current during experimental protocols lasting ∼10 min. finally, lev at the highest
concentration used (200 ␮m) did not influence the activity of
l-, p- or q-type ca2+ channels in ca1 neurons, while selectively influencing the activity of n-type calcium channels. the
maximal effect on these channels separated from other channel
types was ∼37%.
conclusions: our results provide evidence that lev selectively inhibits n-type ca2+ channels of ca1 pyramidal hippocampal neurons. these data suggest the existence of a subtype
of n-type channels sensitive to lev, which might be involved
in the molecular basis of its antiepileptic action. key

 xxxd2466xxx  (lev) is a new antiepileptic drug
(aed) with a unique pharmacologic profile, exerting potent seizure suppression in kindling models of epilepsy
(1–3). it substantially inhibits neuronal hypersynchronization in hippocampal slices induced by application of
high potassium–low calcium perfusion solutions, without
any intrinsic effects on normal electrophysiologic responses. therefore it is of obvious importance to evaluate possible cellular mechanisms of the antiepileptic
action of lev that might be related to its specific interaction with molecular structures responsible for the generation of electrical activity in brain neurons.
previous investigations have failed to find any modulatory activity of  xxxd2466xxx  on voltage-gated na+ and
low-voltage–activated ca2+ currents in rat neocortical
neurons (4,5). therefore special attention was devoted to
high-voltage–activated (hva) ca2+ currents, which also
can be responsible for changes in the firing pattern of

corresponding neurons. recently it was shown that lev
can inhibit hva calcium channels in pyramidal hippocampal neurons (6,7). therefore it was of special interest
to evaluate whether lev can exert a specific action on
different subtypes of hva channels, specifically expressed in various types of nerve cells. in these experiments, we analyzed on isolated rat ca1 hippocampal
neurons the effect of lev on hva ca2+ currents, separated into the main subtypes (l, n, p, q, and r) by the
application of standard selective channel blockers.
methods
primary hippocampal neurons
neurons were dissociated with a modification of the
method described previously (8). wistar rats at postnatal
day p14 were used. at this age, hippocampal neurons
express hva ca2+ channels well, electrophysiologic
properties of which are similar to those in older animals,
and the yield of viable neurons with our dissociation
technique is higher than that in older animals. the rats
were deeply anesthetized with ether and decapitated. the
brain was removed and submerged in iced ringer solu-

tion (equilibrated with 95% o2/5% co2). after 1 min,
the brain was removed from the ringer solution, and the
hippocampus was isolated. slices (500 ␮m) were taken
with a blade and transferred to a chamber containing
hepes-buffered solution (equilibrated with 95% o2/5%
co2). after 20–30 min, trypsin (0.02% type xi; sigma,
st. louis, mo, u.s.a.) was added to the incubation
chamber. after 30 min of exposure to trypsin, the slices
were washed (30 min) before being prepared for recording. immediately before recording, a hippocampal slice
was removed from the chamber, and the ca1 region was
cut away from the remaining tissue. ca1 neurons were
immediately isolated by using modified vibrodissociation technique (9). the cell suspension was plated on a
coverslip in the recording chamber (room temperature,
20–22°c), perfused with extracellular solution (mm: tetraethylammonium chloride, 25;  xxxd1804xxx , 5; mgcl2, 2; kcl,
3; cacl2, 5; nacl, 100; hepes, 20; tetrodotoxin (ttx),
0.001; at ph 7.4) at 1–2 ml/min, and viewed with inverted microscope. drug application was performed by
using an application system consisting of a glass pipette
with internal diameter of ∼200 ␮m. drug solutions were
delivered by gravity flow from independent reservoirs
placed above the preparation, and solution changes were
effected by switching electromicrovalves. between drug
applications, the cells were constantly bathed in normal
external solution flowing from the application pipette.
electrophysiological measurements
cells were voltage clamped with the whole-cell patchclamp technique. whole-cell ca2+ currents were recorded at high time resolution with a computercontrolled patch-clamp amplifier epc-9 and “pulse”
software (heka electronic, lambrecht, germany). data
processing, acquisition, and their analysis were conducted on power pc macintosh computer with “pulse”
and special software developed by our laboratory on the
basis of “igorpro,” (wavemetrics, u.s.a.) as well as on
pc computers with standard software. the composition
of pipette solution used in this study was (mm) cscl, 90;
hepes, 20; mgcl2, 2;  xxxd83xxx  (atp), 5;
egta, 10; nacl, 10; at ph 7.2. all data shown represent
the mean ± sem. statistical comparisons were performed by using the one-way analysis of variance
(anova) method. a value of p < 0.05 was regarded as
a statistically significant difference. lev was obtained
from ucb (s.a. braine l’alleud, belgium), ca2+ channel blockers from alomone labs (jerusalem, israel), and
all other chemicals were from sigma (u.s.a.).

rat hippocampus, ca2+ currents were elicited by potential
shifts from a holding potential (vh) of −70 mv to depolarizing test potentials (ranging from −60 to +50 mv) for
50 ms. figure 1a shows a representative ica and also the
time course of ica inhibition by lev. peak ica values at
test potential +10 mv were used to evaluate ica amplitude. application of 5–200 ␮m lev irreversibly (in the
range of 30 min after application) inhibited evoked ica in
all tested cells (n ⳱ 122) to a sustained level (fig. 1a).
figure 1b shows superimposed current traces before and
after application of 50 ␮m lev. in addition to inhibition
of the steady-state current, lev also changed current
decay without shifting the current–voltage relation (i-v).
figure 1c shows the averaged i-v obtained from three
neurons. lev inhibited ica at voltages between −30 mv
and +40 mv with more or less equal effectiveness.
our experiments showed that the lev effect is not
time dependent, because its maximal value did not
change during the course of experiment (10–20 min).
besides, studies of lev influence on ca2+ current run-

down have shown that the velocities of the current magnitude decrease during the experiment in control
conditions and, in the presence of 200 ␮m lev, were
similar.
concentration dependence of  xxxd2466xxx  effect
the dose–response relation of the lev-induced inhibition of ica was studied by using voltage steps to +10
mv (corresponding to the maximum of i-v) from a holding potential of −70 mv. figure 2 demonstrates that
sustained inhibition of ica by lev was concentration
dependent. the concentration dependence of the lev
block was fitted with empirical hill equation by the
least-squares method (fig. 2, solid line). determined
half-maximal concentration (ic50) for the sustained inhibition of ica by lev was 14.7 ± 1.6 ␮m (n ⳱ 62; fig.
2). maximal inhibition was observed at 200 ␮m and was
∼18%, which could be only slightly increased (up to
21%) at significantly higher lev concentrations (1 mm
lev). the data were well fitted by a hill curve with
slope factor n equals to 1.5 for sustained lev effect.
kinetic properties of high voltage–activated calcium
channels under  xxxd2466xxx  treatment
a two-pulse protocol was used to study voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of ica in a part of
tested cells. from holding potential of −70 mv cells were
stepped to a range of potentials from −60 mv to +10 mv
in 10 mv steps for a period of 2 s and then stepped to +10
mv. the symbols in fig. 3a represent the mean data of
current steady-state inactivation in control (open
squares) and in the presence of 200 ␮m lev (solid
circles). as can be seen, the inactivation characteristics
could be only slightly influenced by lev.
in control conditions, the membrane potential at which

calcium current traces correspond to control (1) and application

half-inactivation occurred (v1/2) was −10.68 ± 1.24 mv
(n ⳱ 3), and after 200 ␮m application, it was −12.24 ±
1.06 mv (n ⳱ 3). the slope factor (k) was 8.7 ± 1.12 mv
(n ⳱ 3) and 7.73 ± 0.95 mv (n ⳱ 3) for control and
lev cases. the open triangles in fig. 3a represent the
current activation expressed as maximal available current in control, and solid triangles, in the presence of 200
␮m lev (fig. 3a). the figure shows that the activation
characteristics also were not significantly influenced by
lev, similar to the inactivation case. thus in control
conditions, the membrane potential at which halfactivation occurred (v1/2) was −6.8 ± 1.18 mv (n ⳱ 3),
and after 200 ␮m application, it was −7.03 ± 0.9 mv
(n ⳱ 3). the slope factor (k) was 9 mv for both cases.
the region of overlap between the two curves was in the
range of −40 to +10 mv, which would result in a sigepilepsia, vol. 43, no. 1, 2002

nificant sustained inward current (window current). in
both cases, the experimental points could not be well
fitted by a standard boltzmann function (solid line). conversely, the experimental points could be well fitted by
double boltzmann functions (dotted lines) for activation
and inactivation processes, suggesting either that at least
two different types of ca2+ channels can be represented
in tested cells or that a single population of channels
undergoes multiple activation/inactivation processes.
these data testify that kinetic characteristics of total current and hence all of its components are not significantly
influenced by lev.
the time course of recovery from inactivation was
studied by using a double-pulse protocol in some of the
tested cells. cells were held at −70 mv and then stepped
to +10 mv. this was followed by a variable delay from
10 to 800 ms, whereupon the cells were again stepped to
+10mv. the potential during the variable-delay period
was −70mv. recovery was mainly complete after delays
400 ms. the data could be well fitted by a single exponential giving a time constant for recovery from inactivation of 338 ms in control and 306 ms in the presence
of 50 or 200 ␮m lev. thus application of lev did not
influence this characteristic significantly.
effects of prepulses on  xxxd2466xxx -induced
inhibition of vdccs
the rapid onset, on the order of seconds, for the inhibition of ica by lev indicates that the response might be
mediated by a membrane-delimited mechanism. it is well
established that a large depolarizing prepulse reverses
the inhibition of ica by the membrane-delimited (due to
a direct interaction of g proteins with a ca channel molecule) action of g protein ␤␥ subunits (10,11). in the
present study, a prepulse to +100 mv for 100 ms did not
reverse the lev-induced inhibition (fig. 3b). in the
presence of lev, the ica after such a prepulse (c2) was
similar to the current observed before the prepulse (c1).
similar results were observed on three other ca1 neurons tested by this protocol. the c2/c1 ratio of ica was
investigated either in absence or in the presence of 50
␮m lev (fig. 3b). in control conditions, we did not
observe ica facilitation, and this ratio was 0.82 ± 0.06
(n ⳱ 3). this fact may reflect the absence of direct tonic
voltage-dependent inhibition of the vdccs by g protein
␤␥ subunits in these conditions (10,11). application of
lev insignificantly increased this ratio to 0.87 ± 0.08
(n ⳱ 3); however, the effect was not statistically significant at the 0.05 level (p > 0.5). these results indicate that
g proteins are not involved in the inhibition of ica by lev.
effects of ca2+ channel blockers on
 xxxd2466xxx  effect
to detect which types of vdccs contributed to the
component of ica that was inhibited by lev, we used the
selective ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine (l-type) and
epilepsia, vol. 43, no. 1, 2002

␻-conotoxin-gvia (␻ctxgvia, n-type). both the contributions of these subtypes of vdcc to the total calcium
influx and the relative percentages of lev-induced inhibition of each subtype were measured. the membrane
potential of recorded neurons was held at −70 mv, and a
voltage step to a test potential (+10 mv) was applied.
the contribution of l-type calcium channels to the
blocking effect of lev was first tested. for blockage of
l-type, we used nifedipine, a widely accepted selective
blocker of l-type ca2+ channels, which blocks these
channels at range of concentrations from 5 to 50 ␮m in
different types of neurons (12,13). therefore, we used
nifedipine in concentrations of 20 ␮m to inhibit l-type
ca2+ channels maximally in hippocampal neurons, as it
was used previously (8,14). figure 4a shows that application of the l-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine (20 ␮m) caused a decrease of the total calcium
current by ∼25%. it is well known that nifedipine exerts
a fast developing maximal effect, which is easily reversible (15). next, application of 200 ␮m lev reduced
further the calcium current amplitude by 16.95 ± 4.55%
(n ⳱ 8; fig. 4a–c). lev did not influence the i-v
dependence of vdcc in the presence of the blocker. in
some of our experiments, we observed putative time dependence of the nifedipine-blocking effect; however, this
slight decrease of current amplitude in time may be a
result of ca2+ current rundown. therefore in such cases,
we calculated the effect from a base level just preceding
the lev application.
we next explored the effect of selective blockade of
calcium channel subtype by ␻ctxgvia. the
␻ctxgvia, a peptide toxin of the marine snail conus
geographus, has been well characterized as a specific
n-channel blocker (16). in mammalian neurons,
␻ctxgvia irreversibly blocks n-type channels (17,18)
in the range of concentrations from 0.1 to 3 ␮m used by
different authors for hippocampal neurons (19–21). at
special experimental conditions (long-lasting deep prehyperpolarization), its blocking effect can be partly reversed (22). in our experiments, we did not apply such
protocols and used mainly 0.5 ␮m blocker, as at higher
concentration (1 ␮m), it had no additional effect. when
n-type calcium channels were irreversibly blocked by
0.5 ␮m ␻ctxgvia, ica was reduced by ∼48% (fig. 5),
but there were no statistically significant changes in the
amplitude of ica during the following 200 ␮m lev application (fig. 5a–c). current–voltage relations also
were without statistically significant additional changes
during lev application (fig. 5b).
it was reported previously that the efficacy of
␻ctxgvia action on n-type ca2+ channels in neurons
significantly depends on the extracellular ca2+ because
of competition between ␻ctxgvia and ca2+ ions for
binding sites (23,24). therefore in the next series of experiments, we used ␻ctxgvia pretreatment of cells in

ca2+-free solution. the protocol of these experiments
was as follows: cells were incubated for several minutes
(10–15 min) before recording in 1 ␮m ␻ctxgviacontaining solution in which ca2+ was replaced by
equimolar amounts of tris ions. in such experiments, we
used a higher toxin concentration (1 ␮m) to preclude a
possible decrease of its effectiveness during incubation.
application of 200 ␮m lev did not induce inhibition of
ca2+ current in ␻ctxgvia-pretreated cells.
these results clearly show that lev selectively inhib-

its n-type ca2+ channels. to compare the effectiveness
of ␻ctxgvia and lev, we tested ␻ctxgvia effect on
ca2+ current exposed to a saturating concentration of
lev (200 ␮m). we conducted the mirror recordings of
the experiment presented in fig. 5. in this case, we first
exposed ca current to 200 ␮m lev, and then, 0.5 ␮m
␻ctxgvia was additionally applied (fig. 6a). as can
be seen from fig. 6a, saturated concentration of lev
could not completely block n-type channels, which were
then additionally blocked by the toxin. figure 6b shows
that preincubation of cells in ca2+-free solution containing 200 ␮m lev also was unable to block completely
n-type ca channels. moreover, the value of their blocking by lev, estimated from the efficacy of ␻ctxgvia
to block the residual current (∼29%), was the same as in
previous cases.
these facts point to nonadditive inhibitory actions of
lev and ␻ctxgvia, and hence selective but incomplete blockade of n-type ca2+ channels by lev. however, the question arises, whether other types of hva
ca2+ channels (p, q, and r types) are sensitive to this
compound.

discussion
despite extensive experimental and clinical investigations summarized in recent reviews concerning descriptions of the antiepileptic action of  xxxd2466xxx  ( xxxd2466xxx )
(28–35), the exact mechanisms of its action are still unsettled. the existing experimental data do not allow attribution to lev any of the three main mechanisms
currently accepted for the established aeds: conventional ␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)ergic facilitation or
inhibition of either na+ or low-voltage–activated ca2+

channels contribute mainly to total hva calcium current
in ca1 hippocampal neurons. however, the presence of
a remaining current unblocked by these blockers suggested the presence of other ca-channel types, which
could be blocked by cd2+ ions (not shown). therefore in
the next experiments, we tested the contribution of p/q
types of calcium channels to the total peak current with
the use of specific toxin blockers ␻-agatoxin (p/q types)
and ␻ctxmviic (q type). we used low concentrations
of ␻-agatoxin, which is specific for p-type and not for
q-type vdccs (25,26). the 50 nm ␻-agatoxin blocked
the total calcium current in tested ca1 hippocampal neurons by 16.8 ± 2.7% (n ⳱ 7; fig. 7a). application of
200 ␮m lev decreased further the magnitude of
vdccs by 15.6 ± 5.6% (n ⳱ 4; fig. 7a,c). corresponding current–voltage dependence is presented on fig.7b.
these experiments clearly show that the inhibitory effect
of lev is additive to the action of a selective blocker of
p-type vdccs and hence lev is not their blocker.
we next explored the effect of selective blockade of
q-subtype calcium channel by 200 nm ␻ctxmviic,
which is effective for hippocampal neurons (20,27). we
found that this agent blocked the total vdccs only by
9.4 ± 1.4% (n ⳱ 9) showing poor representation of this
type in tested neurons. when q-type calcium channels
were irreversibly blocked by ␻ctxmviic (200 nm), the
amplitude of vdccs was further reduced with 200 ␮m
lev by 17.4 ± 2.1% (n ⳱ 8), fig. 8a and c.
in this case, the voltage-dependent properties also
were without changes (fig. 8b). described experiments

currents (4). therefore other types of currents can be
putative targets for this aed. our previous studies of
electrical activity of ca1 hippocampal neurons from rats
showed a possible role of ca2+ ions entering into the cell
during membrane depolarization in the development of
epileptiform activity (36,37). recently it was reported
that lev produces a limited depression of hva ca2+
currents in rat ca1 hippocampal neurons (6,7). this observation directed the present task: to determine the selectivity of lev action on different types of hva ca2+
channels.
the obtained experimental data clearly demonstrate an
irreversible inhibitory effect of lev on hva ca2+ currents in the investigated hippocampal neurons. the observed effect occurs within a few seconds and is not
related to possible action of the drug on indirect mechanisms regulating ca2+-channel activity, like activation of
corresponding g proteins (38,39). by using available
channel blockers, it was possible to separate the integral
hva ca2+ current into its main subtypes and to show
that hippocampal neurons express all known types of
hva ca2+ channels (l, n, p, q, and r) expressed in
different ratios. this gave us the opportunity to analyze
all possible targets of the inhibitory action of lev by
blocking them separately with selective channel blockers. the results clearly indicate that lev, even at high
concentrations, does not influence the activity of other
types of hva calcium channels except those of the n
type. this finding is obviously very important for understanding of the mechanisms of the antiepileptic action of
the drug, as n-type channels, according to our data, form
the predominant population (∼48%) of hva ca2+ in hippocampal neurons and therefore are of major importance
for the determination of their firing patterns. at the same
time, this also may explain the specific binding of lev
in rat central nervous system (cns) (40), where n-type
channels (␣1b) are principally expressed in comparison
with other tissues (41). the predominant action of lev
on discrete areas of rat brain such as striatum (42), where
n-type channels compose the main subpopulation of calcium channels (43), was shown. it also was shown that
another aed, lamotrigine (ltg; lamictal) also can exert its effect through inhibition of presynaptic n-type
ca2+ channels (44–46). another indication of possible
involvement of this type of channel into neuronal disturbance during epilepsy is the fact that kindling induces a
long-term enhancement in the density of n-type calcium
channels in ca1 and ca3 rat hippocampal neurons
through changing of their expression and trafficking
(47).
the most intriguing result of our data is the inability of
lev to block n-type channels completely, even at very
high concentrations, and the absence of additivity between its action and the action of ␻ctxgvia, a known
selective blocker of n-type channels. the maximal inepilepsia, vol. 43, no. 1, 2002

hibitory effect of lev was ∼18%, whereas that of
␻ctxgvia was ∼48%. after inhibition of calcium current by ␻ctxgvia, subsequent application of lev did
not exert any additional inhibitory action. a possible
explanation of this phenomenon can be based on the
mechanisms of toxin action on the channel molecule. we
suggest that the mechanism of lev action on n-type
channels is the same as that of the toxin, because they
both act irreversibly, and their blocking effect develops
quite rapidly. it is generally accepted that the toxin
blocks the channel by occluding the channel pore (22,
48,49). the ␻-conotoxins are large, highly charged molecules, effective as blockers when applied outside cells,
but not when delivered inside (50). all four motifs of the
n-type channels contribute to its interaction with the
toxin, but especially motifs i and iii, which are supposed
to occupy positions diametrically opposite each other
across the pore mouth (49,51). interestingly, the other
conotoxins closely related to ␻ctxgvia, obtained from
venom of other cone snails, label different subsets of
binding sites in the brain (52–55). these peptides have
different effects on transmitter release. on the basis of
this observation, we suggest the heterogeneity of n-type
channel family. it has been shown that n-channels can
differed by expression and assembly of the pore-forming
␣1b subunit with auxiliary ␤ and ␣2/␥ subunits of
n-channels (51,55,56). this suggestion is significant in
light of resent observations that mutation of ␤4 subunit is
the molecular defect in the epileptic mouse strain lethargic (lh/lh) (57). it was suggested that increased excitability and susceptibility to seizures observed in the lh/lh
mouse arise from the inappropriate expression of the
population of n-type vdccs (56,58,59). thus we can
speculate that partial block of n-type channels by lev is
due to n-type channel heterogeneity. probably lev can
block one of the subtypes of n-type channels (perhaps
caused by association with a specific auxiliary subunit)
that is sensitive also to ␻ctxgvia. these compounds
compete for a similar binding site, and a fraction of such
channels remain unblocked by lev in the presence of
toxin, whereas the majority of n-type population is sensitive to the toxin only.
another explanation of different effectiveness of
␻ctxgvia and lev may be their action on different
motifs or subunits of n-channels. of course, this suggestion is speculative and demands further experimental
confirmation.
finally, it should be stressed that lev appears to be
one of the first synthetic selective blockers of n-type
ca2+ channels, which can be used in clinical practice,
and this may be of great importance for more effective
treatment of epileptic disorders.
