abstract
background. low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) are an alternative to unfractionated heparin (ufh) for anticoagulation
during hemodialysis (hd). we performed a prospective randomized crossover study of the effect of enoxaparin,  xxxd2690xxx , and
 xxxd1805xxx  on some hemostatic factors, including  xxxg2266xxx  ( xxxg2266xxx ), in patients with maintenance hd. methods. plasma levels (immunoassays) of total  xxxg2266xxx , platelet-derived growth factor-ab (pdgf-ab), and prothrombin fragment 1 þ 2
(pf 1 þ 2) were evaluated pre-hd, after 10 (t10) and 180 (t180) minutes of hd in 21 patients, who completed a 3-period (for 2
months each) crossover study in 6 groups (latin-square design). results. the baseline  xxxg2266xxx , pdgf-ab, and pf 1 þ 2 levels were
comparable under all lmwh treatments.  xxxg2266xxx  levels, compared with the baseline, significantly
increased (all p < 104), whereas pdgf-ab levels remained stable at each interval during enoxaparin,  xxxd2690xxx , and  xxxd1805xxx 
anticoagulated hd. interestingly,  xxxg2266xxx  increment at t10 was the highest, dose-dependent, and accompanied by pf 1 þ 2 decrease
under enoxaparin administration. conclusion. the switch from enoxaparin to  xxxd2690xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx  used as anticoagulants
had no long-term effect on the baseline total  xxxg2266xxx  and pf 1 þ 2 levels in chronically hd patients. only short-term, overdialytic
differences were noticed, indicating a single bolus of enoxaparin (0.75 mg/kg) as the most potent stimulus for endothelial  xxxg2266xxx

introduction
low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) comprise a variety
of different molecular weight derivatives of unfractionated
heparin (ufh). major effects of the lmwhs are by potentiating antithrombin activity and exerting anti-xa inhibition. they
can also release  xxxg2266xxx  ( xxxg2266xxx ), von
willebrand factor (vwf), modulate the activity of different
adhesion molecules, and release many other profibrinolytic and
antithrombotic mediators from blood vessel wall.1
the lmwhs, with a mean molecular weight of 4.0 to
6.0 kd, exhibit specific molecular and structural attributes that
are determined by the type of manufacturing process used. for
example, enoxaparin, which is prepared by benzylation followed by alkaline hydrolysis of ufh, exhibits a double bond
at the nonreducing end and the presence of a unique bicyclic
structure namely 1,6 anhydromanno glucose or mannose, or
both, at the reducing end.2 similarly, the other lmwhs, such
as  xxxd1805xxx ,  xxxd2690xxx ,  xxxd3379xxx , and parnaparin, exhibit
specific structural characteristics that may contribute to their
own unique biochemical and pharmacological profiles. these
unique features may not exhibit any major influence on the

routinely determined anti-xa and anti-iia activities.3,4
however, they may have an impact on the pharmacokinetics
and other biological actions such as interaction with growth
factors, blood components, and endothelial cells. simultaneously,  xxxg2266xxx  release contributes to the individuality of lmwhs.
because the lmwhs represent product-specific molecular
and structural attributes, the us food and drug administration
as well as european medicines agency consider each of these
drugs as distinct pharmacological agents. although differences
between various commercially available products have been
described in term of molecular weight profile and biologic
properties, very limited information on the direct comparison
of individual products in chronically hd patients is available.

the current study was designed to comparatively investigate
the influence of 3 lmwhs: enoxaparin ( xxxd1997xxx ),  xxxd1805xxx 
( xxxd1805xxx ), and  xxxd2690xxx  (fraxiparin) given for anticoagulation during hd on plasma levels of total  xxxg2266xxx , plateletderived growth factor-ab (pdgf-ab), and prothrombin
fragments (pf 1 þ 2). platelet-derived growth factor-ab was
chosen among few widely used markers of platelet activation
because it is also proven to have special importance in the progression of atherosclerosis which is flourishing in hemodialysis
(hd) population.5,6

participants and methods
patients
we enrolled 21 patients who had been undergoing maintenance hd in the department of nephrology and transplantation with dialysis unit of medical university in białystok.
they were selected from a group of patients who had been
receiving enoxaparin ( xxxd1997xxx , bellon rhône-poulenc
rorer, montrouge, france) as an anticoagulant during their
hd session for at least 3 months prior to the study. the
enrollment criteria excluded patients with diabetes requiring
insulin, malignancy, hiv, active viral hepatitis b and/or c,
other severe liver diseases, those receiving immunosuppressive, contraceptive, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(except for  xxxd234xxx  administered because of cardiovascular disease),  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists, and those who
had had any inflammatory or infectious diseases during the
preceding month. the dose of dialysis delivered (kt/v, calculated using a single-compartment model), reflecting the
effectiveness of hd session was assigned in each case. its
value below 1.2, as well as incorrect basal whole bloodactivated partial thromboplastin time determined exclusion
from the study. if treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuepo), the patients had reached target hematocrit prior to enrollment and were on maintenance doses
during the study. other patients’ characteristics are presented in table 1.
all the patients had a native arteriovenous fistula allowing
double-needle dialysis at blood flow rates of at least 200 ml/min.
the flow rate of a bicarbonate buffer was 500 ml/min.
before each hd session, the extracorporeal circuit was
rinsed with 1000 ml of 0.9% saline containing 2.0 iu/ml of
ufh (heparin, biochemie, kundl, austria). no other drugs
or blood products were given to patients during dialysis
procedure.

study protocol
the study was performed in conformity with the helsinki
declaration. ethics committee approval was obtained and
informed consent was sought from each patient.
this prospective, 3-period crossover study lasted 6 months.
the patients were randomized (envelope method) to 6 groups.
the sequence of treatments was determined according to

cardiovascular disease was defined as a present or prior pectoral angina, or
myocardial infarction in anamnesis or ecg changes suggestive of ischemia,
ischemic cerebrovascular accident in anamnesis or peripheral vascular disease
(at least 1 nonpulsatile peripheral artery or vascular thrill, except for arteriovenous fistula).

latin-square design (figure 1). such a protocol allowed avoiding random (carryover) and systemic (bias) error as well as
decreasing the sample size at least 9 times. each patient was
tested against himself or herself in 3 different periods (2
months each) during hd under anticoagulation with 3 different
lmwhs. the study was designed to keep the heparin doses,
dialysis membrane, other hd prescriptions, and pharmacologic
treatment stable during the entire 6 months.
initial lmwhs doses were administrated intravenously
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation: 70 iu/kg
of body weight in the case of  xxxd2690xxx  (fraxiparin,
glaxosmithkline, brentford, uk) and  xxxd1805xxx  sodium
( xxxd1805xxx , pfizer, new york), and 0.7 mg/kg of body weight for
enoxaparin. during the first 3 sessions after heparin change, the
doses were modified on the basis of the following clinical
guidelines: no visible fibrin clots in the arterial and venous bubble traps during hd, no clotted filters after hd, and no bleeding
from the fistula puncture sites after compression.7

laboratory procedures
after each 2-month period of the study, blood samples were
obtained during a midweek morning hd session: before hemodialysis (t0) from the arterial needle (before heparinization),
and  xxxd1891xxx  and 180 minutes of dialysis (t10 and t180, respectively) from the predialyzer port after slowing the blood flow
to 100 ml/min for 1 minute. the time range for collecting
blood was adopted from previous studies.8-11
fasting blood was drawn without the use of a tourniquet
through a wide-gauge butterfly needle into (1) diatubesh (bd
vacutainer systems, plymouth, uk) containing a 0.5 ml solution
consisting of citrate (0.109 mol/l), adenosine (3.7 mmol/l),
theophylline (15 mmol/l), and  xxxd1914xxx  (0.198 mmol/l) to
minimize platelet degranulation; (2) monovette vacutainers
(sarstedt, nümbrecht, germany) containing 0.129 mol/l trisodium citrate (0.5 vol anticoagulant and 4.5 vol whole blood). the
first 1 ml of blood was discarded; then 4.5 ml of blood was
collected. tubes were placed in melting ice and centrifuged

15 minutes later at 2000g for 30 minutes. one third of the plasma
was collected from the middle region of the supernatant, aliquoted, and immediately frozen at 70 c. batch analyses
were performed within 8 weeks.
plasma pdgf-ab antigen levels were determined using
solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)
kits purchased from r&d systems, inc, minneapolis, minnesota (quantikine; cat no dhd00b); its minimum detectable
levels was 1.7 pg/ml. prothrombin fragment 1 þ 2 was
determined using enzyme immunoassays enzygnost f 1 þ
2 micro (cat no owvv) from dade behring, marburg,
germany; its minimum detectable level was 0.04 nmol/l.
plasma antigens of total  xxxg2266xxx  were measured using commercial 2-antibody sandwich assay kit imubind (cat no 849),
american diagnostica inc greenwich, connecticut. the total
 xxxg2266xxx  assay detects both intact and truncated forms of the
inhibitor as well as its complexes with tf/viia; its detection
limit was 0.18 ng/ml.

all the measurements were performed in duplicate using
a 400 sfc photometer (slt-labinstruments, gröding/
salzburg, austria), and calibrated using provided recombinant human reference samples and standards. for calculation
of the results, a computer and curve-fitting software were
used. their intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variations
were <9%. the values obtained after 180 minutes of hd
were corrected for hemoconcentration according to plasma
protein levels.

 xxxd1997xxx  treatment
the mean, minimal, and maximal doses of enoxaparin,
 xxxd2690xxx , and  xxxd1805xxx  were respectively, 0.75, 0.27, and
1.1 mg/kg for enoxaparin; 70.4, 61.3, and 78.6 iu/kg for  xxxd2690xxx ; 66.0, 55.6, and 75.2 iu/kg for  xxxd1805xxx . slight hemorrhagic complications, demanding  xxxd1805xxx  dose adjusting,
appeared in only 1 case.

total  xxxg2266xxx  levels during different lmwhs hd
statistical analysis
all data were analyzed using statistica software (version
6.0 pl, statsoft, tulsa, oklahoma). shapiro-wilk w test of
normality was used for data distribution analysis. the normally
distributed data were presented as mean + 1 sd, and the
skewed data as median (full range). according to data distribution, repeated measures analysis of variances (rm anova) or
friedman’s anova test was performed for plasma levels of
the markers studied within participants during 3 periods of different anticoagulation. for comparison between 2 groups nonparametric wilcoxon single-rank or mann-whitney u tests
were used when appropriate. comparisons within 1 group were
made by kruskal-wallis anova and chi-square tests. bivariate correlations were assessed using nonparametric spearman
regression test. all statistical tests were 2-sided and only p <
.05 was considered significant.

results
a total of 17 patients uneventfully completed the study; 2
patients died from complications not relevant to the study, 1
patient treated with  xxxd2690xxx  refused further cooperation
because of repeated hemorrhage after hd despite minimal
heparin dose, and 1 patient had to receive therapeutic doses
of enoxaparin after surgery for femoral neck fracture.

plasma total  xxxg2266xxx  levels significantly increased during hd
under 3 lmwhs studied: enoxaparin (w2 anova ¼ 24.47,
p < 106),  xxxd2690xxx  (w2 anova ¼ 20.12, p < 103) and  xxxd1805xxx  (w2 anova ¼ 20.59, p < 103) as shown in table 2
and figure 2. the baseline plasma total  xxxg2266xxx  levels were comparable in whole group regardless of the heparin sort.
during enoxaparin treatment, the total  xxxg2266xxx  values increased
by a median of 293% (p < 103) and remained still higher at
t180 (p < 104) compared to pre-hd levels. during hd anticoagulated with  xxxd2690xxx , they increased by a median of 233%
(p < 103) and remained unchanged after further 180 minutes
(p < 103) compared with the baseline levels. under  xxxd1805xxx 
treatment, the total  xxxg2266xxx  increased by a median of 216%
under the first 10 minutes (p < 102) and remained similar at
t180 (p < 104) of hd session. the percentage total  xxxg2266xxx  increment after 10 minutes of hd occurred to be dose-dependent
(r ¼ .576 p ¼ .015) only under enoxaparin treatment.
the total  xxxg2266xxx  increment after 180 minutes of hd procedure correlated inversely with its pre-hd values (figure 3), and
this association was independent of the type of anticoagulant.

(w2 anova ¼ 6.12, p ¼ .047) and  xxxd2690xxx  (w2 anova ¼
8.33, p ¼ .015) anticoagulated hd and did not change during
 xxxd1805xxx  treatment (w2 anova ¼ 0.35, p ¼ .838). the baseline plasma pf 1 þ 2 levels were comparable under all lmwh
treatments.
during enoxaparin treatment, pf 1 þ 2 decreased by a median of 22% after 10 minutes (p ¼ .015) and remained still lower
after 180 minutes of the session compared to its pre-hd values
(p ¼ .031). their decrement at t10 as well as the values
obtained after 180 minutes of hd were associated with the
enoxaparin dose/kg (r ¼ .431, p ¼ .046; r ¼ .478, p ¼
.049, respectively).
during  xxxd2690xxx  anticoagulated hd, plasma pf 1 þ 2
decreased by a median of 18% after 10 minutes (p ¼ .015) and
returned to its baseline levels after 180 minutes of hd (p ¼
0.184). there were no associations between pf 1 þ 2 and
 xxxd2690xxx  dosage in any period of the study.
hemodialysis with  xxxd1805xxx  did not affect plasma pf 1 þ 2
levels (all ps > .05). simultaneously, there were no correlation
between their levels and  xxxd1805xxx  dose after both 10 and 180
minutes of hd session.

anova ¼ 0.25, p ¼ .899) and  xxxd1805xxx  (w2 anova ¼
1.78, p ¼ .344) treatment (table 2, figure 2).

the effect of heparin switch
the switch from enoxaparin to  xxxd2690xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx  used
as anticoagulants during hd session had no long-range effect
on the baseline total  xxxg2266xxx , pdgf-ab, and pf 1 þ 2 levels.
it was only connected with short-term, overdialytic different
effects on  xxxg2266xxx  release. enoxaparin usage was associated with
the highest  xxxg2266xxx  increment after 10 minutes (w2 anova ¼
5.84, p ¼ .048), whereas  xxxd1805xxx  treatment with the highest
pf 1 þ 2 levels after 10 minutes (w2 anova ¼ 8.59, p ¼ .014)
of hd session (table 2).

discussion
ever since the introduction of lmwhs for clinical use, one of
the major questions relates to product interchangeability and
differences between each of the individual lmwhs’ clinical
effects. the novel finding of our study is that a single bolus
of enoxaparin (0.75 mg/kg) is the most potent stimuli of
dose-dependent  xxxg2266xxx  release during hd procedure. simultaneously, we did not observe any long-term effect of different
lmwhs on the baseline total  xxxg2266xxx , pdgf-ab, and pf 1þ2
levels in chronically hd patients.
one of the most important actions of heparins is a substantial increase in plasma  xxxg2266xxx  levels.12  xxxg748xxx  pathway
inhibitor, the leading inhibitor of tf-initiated coagulation, is
6

clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis 000(00)
a circulating and endothelial-bound  xxxg745xxx  that inhibits
factor viia/tf complexes in a  xxxg741xxx -dependent manner.
the underlying mechanism and the vascular sites from which
the molecule is released are not quite clear. heparin has been
found to displace  xxxg2266xxx  from its endothelial membrane-bound
complexes with glycosaminoglycans, that is heparan sulfate,13
as well as to mobilize  xxxg2266xxx  from intracellular stores.14 however, the platelets can be the potential sources of plasma  xxxg2266xxx 
as well. we are aware of and have considered the possibility of
ex vivo thrombocyte activation; first, because it inevitably
occurs during the hd procedure (not fully biocompatible), second, due to the hardly avoidable platelet degranulation during
blood sampling.15 with the regard to the release of  xxxg2266xxx  from
platelets, there is a general agreement that pdgf-ab is a sensitive marker of platelet activation.15 even though it has been
known that lmwh causes reduced platelet activation compared to ufh,16 we have monitored plasma pdgf-ab levels
during hd procedure in our patients. as we have already
reported,10 we did not observe any significant pdgf-ab
increase during hd procedure, as well as its correlations with
overdialytic total  xxxg2266xxx  levels. this finding indirectly supports
that platelets are not a meaningful source of plasma  xxxg2266xxx  during lmwhs anticoagulated hd. furthermore, once-daily
subcutaneous injection of all 3 lmwhs during hd has been
shown to result in transiently increased total  xxxg2266xxx  levels,
which present, however, no effect on freely available,
heparin-releasable  xxxg2266xxx  store in patients on maintenance
hd. this conclusion is based on a strong inverse association
between the post-heparin  xxxg2266xxx  increments and the baseline
levels of the inhibitor, which we have reported earlier in a
study with ufh.8
what is interesting in our study is that single enoxaparin
bolus causes the highest plasma total  xxxg2266xxx  increase and pf 1
þ 2 depletion after 10 minutes of its administration during
hd procedure compared with  xxxd2690xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx . this
effect is also dose-dependent. in contrast, during  xxxd1805xxx 
treatment, plasma pf 1 þ 2 level changes during hd were
nearly unnoticeable. these discrepancies may depend on individual heparin properties such as pharmacokinetics. enoxaparin (*4.2 kd), despite its lower mean molecular weight,
offers longer biological half-life compared to  xxxd2690xxx 
(*4.5 kd) and  xxxd1805xxx  (*5 kd).12 the apparent total body
clearance of enoxaparin is significantly smaller than those of
 xxxd2690xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx  whereas  xxxd1805xxx  apparent clearance is about 1.5-fold greater than that of  xxxd2690xxx  (measured
in people in whom prophylactic doses of those lmwhs were
used).12 in healthy people, renal excretion pattern, measured
as the percentage of fragments exhibiting an anti-xa activity
which are recovered in urine after subcutaneous heparin administration, is the highest in the case of enoxaparin (6%-8.5%)
and the lowest in the case of  xxxd1805xxx  (about 3.4%). hence,
apparent elimination half-life values amount to 4.1 hours for
enoxaparin, 3.7 hours for  xxxd2690xxx , and 2.8 hours for  xxxd1805xxx .12 we can only extrapolate these data to patients with
maintenance hd, because there have been no such precise
studies in patients with end-stage renal disease so far. there

naumnik et al
is no clear dose-adjustment conversion rate for the stage of
chronic kidney disease. currently, the dosage of heparins has
been arbitrarily reduced up to 50% in chronically hd patients.
in conclusion, enoxaparin appears to cause greater  xxxg2266xxx 
release during hd procedure compared with  xxxd2690xxx  and
 xxxd1805xxx . this phenomenon needs further explanation but
adds strongly to the discussion on lmwh interchangeability
and proves once again that heparins are not created equal. the
switch from enoxaparin to  xxxd2690xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx  used as
anticoagulants during hd session has no long-range effect on
the baseline total  xxxg2266xxx  and pf 1 þ 2 levels.
