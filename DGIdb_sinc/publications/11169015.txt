the folate cycle and disease in humans. the prevalence of
hyperhomocysteinemia in renal disease patients, its treatment
by folate administration, and its aggravation by the 677 c-t
mutation of methylene-tetrahydrofolate (methylene-thf) re-
ductase has established the folate cycle as an important factor
in the pathogenesis and management of renal disease. proper
function of the folate cycle depends on normal function of
involved enzymes adequate of the vitamin and its correct dispo-
sition within the body. vital processes in folate disposition
include conversion of dietary folylpolyglutamates to monoglu-
tamates, intestinal absorption, receptor and carrier-mediated
transport across cell membranes, and cellular export. folate
coenzymes are responsible for the one-carbon unit transfer in
intermediary metabolism and are required for several reactions
in key metabolic processes, for example of purine, pyrimidine
and methionine synthesis, and glycine and serine metabolism.
 xxxg1479xxx  and its recently discovered reducing pro-
tein as well as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase are key
folate enzymes in homocysteine metabolism. deficiencies of
these enzymes are important causes of severe disease in the
rare remethylation defects causing homocystinuria. knowledge
of their catalytic and molecular properties is important in un-
derstanding possible causes of moderate hyperhomocysteine-
mia, as for example, the well-known 677 c-t transition of
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase.

folate is vital in humans for several metabolic reac-
tions involved in the formation and transfer of c1 units.
as with other vitamins such as b, [1], a large number
of different physiological and metabolic processes are
necessary to convert  xxxd2146xxx  in the diet into intracellu-
lar, metabolically active forms. these processes include
interconversion of polyglutamate and monoglutamate
forms of folate, intestinal uptake, transport across cell
membranes, and export processes and metabolic reac-
tions catalyzed by specific enzymes.

deficiency of folate caused by renal loss or poor nutri-
tion may be important in relationship to renal disease.
for example, low dietary intake [2] and low blood levels
[3] of folate in dialysis patients are well known, and
anemia in renal failure patients, whether or not on dial-
ysis, is a common finding [4]. monitoring of nutritional

status [5] and adjuvant therapy, including folate, irre-
spective of hyperhomocysteinemia [6], plays an impor-
tant role in the management of renal disease.

in recent years, the link between folate homeostasis
and homocysteine metabolism has been established to be
important in a number of disease states, including various
types of vascular disease [7] as well as in renal disease.
the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in renal dis-
ease patients [8, 9], its treatment by folate administration
[10] and its aggravation by the 677 c-~t mutation of
methylene-tetrahydrofolate (methylene-thf) reductase
[11] have established the folate cycle as an important fac-
tor in the pathogenesis and management of renal disease.

this article reviews current knowledge of processes
involved in folate homeostasis and metabolism. particu-
lar emphasis is placed on folate enzymes directly related
to homocysteine metabolism.

processing of ingested folate and
intestinal transport

the  xxxd2146xxx  molecule is complex and consists of
2-amino-4-hydroxy-pteridine linked to p-aminobenzoic
acid (that is, pteroic acid) combined with a variable num-
ber (one to nine) of  xxxd2431xxx  residues (fig. 1). these
glutamate moeties are bound to pteroic acid and to each
other by amide linkages involving the gamma carboxyl
group of glutamate [12]. dietary folates exist mainly as
5-methyl- and 10-formyl-thf in polyglutamate forms
that cannot cross cell membranes [13] and must be enzy-
matically hydrolyzed by folylpolyglutamate  xxxg887xxx 
(e.c. 3.4.19.9) to the monoglutamy] form in the intestine
to be absorbed. the conjugases are widely distributed.
the human  xxxg887xxx  isolated from jejunal brush bor-
ders is a lysosomal exopeptidase cleaving terminal y glu-
 xxxd2571xxx  residues [14-16]. a second distinct enzyme from
jejunal mucosa is located intracellularly and is reported
to have endopeptidase activity [17].

once folate has entered the enterocyte by specific mem-
brane transport, intracellular polyglutamate synthesis oc-
curs to meet the cellular needs for folate metabolism
and also to maintain a concentration gradient in favor
of entry of folate monoglutamate into the cell. reconver-

sion of polyglutamates to monoglutamates allows trans-
port across the basolateral membrane into the portal
circulation, mainly as 5-methyl-thf, most of which is
nonspecifically bound to albumin [18].

cellular transport of folate

transport of folates across cell membranes is facili-
tated by both receptor-mediated and carrier-mediated
mechanisms, which are variably expressed in different
tissues. membrane folate receptors, which are attached
through glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol anchors, have a
high affinity for  xxxd2146xxx  as well as for reduced folates
[19]. their distribution in cell membranes is diffuse, and
internalization of folate probably involves classic endo-
cytosis [20]. folate receptors have been described in
three isoforms, two of which are widely distributed, while
one seems to be specifically associated with placenta and
is likely to be important in the maternal-fetal transfer
of folate [21, 22].

carrier-mediated systems (rfc) exhibit a much higher
affinity for reduced folates (1 to 5 pmol/l) than for
 xxxd2146xxx  (about 200 to 400 zmol/l) and facilitate active
transport involving exchange with organic anions [23].

one example of a folate uptake mechanism is that
existing in the brush border membrane of rat small intes-
tine luminal epithelium with a ph optimum of 5.5 to 6
and high saturability (k,, < 5 pmol/l), which can inter-
nalize all folate compounds, including  xxxd2146xxx . another

be related to folate absorption, and appears to be located
in the plasma membrane at the basolateral surface [24].
the functional expression and mrna distribution of a
rfc-1 cdna involved in folate transport have been
described [25]. subsequent studies in the mouse revealed
a higher capacity for 5-methyl-thf uptake in mature
absorptive cells than in proliferative crypt cells, and this
was associated with rcf-1 gene expression, which codes
for a 58 kd brush border membrane protein [24].

folate exit pumps, which are directly linked to adeno-
sine 5'-triphosphate (atp) hydrolysis, will act in opposi-
tion to folate uptake so that maintenance of the trans-
membrane folate gradient will depend on the net effect
of these two processes [26, 27].

finally, passive diffusion has also been shown to play
a role in  xxxg807xxx -mediated transport across the
human placenta [28].

once transported into cells, monoglutamyl folates
must be converted to their polyglutamyl forms by folyl-
poly y-glutamate synthetase ( xxxg814xxx ), the latter be-
ing preferentially retained in cells [29]. cytosolic and
mitochondrial isoforms of folylpoly y-glutamate synthe-
tase exist, probably coded for by the same gene whose
variable transcription has been proposed to regulate en-
 xxxg1282xxx  levels in different tissues [30]. the degree of poly-
glutamylation may be important in the effectiveness of
antifolate drugs such as methotrexate [31].

oxidation levels of formyl (—hco), methylene (—ch,~),
or methyl (—ch;; fig. 1), and are covalently attached
to the nitrogen atoms at position 5 and/or 10. these
modifications involve several enzyme reactions related
to different essential metabolic pathways such as the
synthesis of purines, pyrimidines and methionine, glycine
and serine metabolism, and the breakdown of histidine
[12]. table 1 summarizes the main reactions and lists
special features and references to main data on enzymes
of the folate cycle. the interactions of folate coenzymes
and ci unit metabolism are illustrated in figure 2.

folate compounds must be in the reduced and polyglu-
 xxxd2571xxx  form to function as coenzymes. reduction of folic
acid or dihydrofolate to thf is catalyzed by dihydrofo-
late reductase. this enzyme plays an important role in
folate homeostasis and has received much attention as
the site of action of cancer treatment [32].

c,-thf synthetase

three enzymes, 10 formyl-thf synthetase, 5,10 meth-
enyl-thf cyclohydrolase, and 5,10 methylene-thf de-
hydrogenase, which constitute the multi-enzyme complex
c,-thf synthetase, are responsible for the interconver-
sion of (j) 10-formyl-thf with thf and formate, (2)
10-formyl-thf with 5,10-methenyl-thf, and (3) 5,10-

methenyl-thf with 5,10-methylene-thf [33]. the cdna
codes for a protein of 101 kd corresponding well with the

_ properties of the enzyme purified from human liver [34].

10-formyl-thf can also be converted to thf and carbon
dioxide in the reaction catalyzed by the liver-specific 10-
formyl-thf dehydrogenase, whereby excess c-1 units
are released and the thf pool is maintained [35].

5,10-methylene-thf

5,10-methylene-thf is a central compound in the fo-
late cycle since (7) it provides the entry point of the
quantitatively important supply of c1 units from serine
through the interconversion of glycine and serine cata-
lyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase; (2) it links
this supply of ci units to the formation of thymidylate
for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides; and (3) it is
reduced to 5-methyl-thf by methylene-thf reductase.

this provides methyl groups for the formation of me-
thionine from homocysteine in the  xxxg1479xxx 
catalyzed reaction, which links folate metabolism intri-
cately to homocysteine and finally allows thf to re-
enter the pool of reduced folates.

purine nucleotide synthesis

the folate cycle is also linked directly to purine nucleo-
tide synthesis through the provision of carbon atoms

folate cycle. the two reactions are catalyzed by a bifunc-
tional octameric enzyme with glutamate formimino
transferase and n° formimino-thf cyclodeaminase ac-
tivities. recent studies report cloning and characteriza-
tion of a rat bifunctional enzyme of 58 kd localized to
the golgi apparatus [36, 37].

serine metabolism and folate

serine hydroxymethyltransferase plays a key role in
ci-unit metabolism [38].

both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms exist, and
cdnas have been cloned for the human enzyme (39, 40].
the genes for the cytosolic form and mitochondrial form
have been characterized [39], and a pseudo gene has
been found on chromosome 1p32.3-33 [41]. the exact
role of the different isoenzymes in c1 unit metabolism
is not fully understood, but it has been proposed that
their regulation might influence cell proliferation and be
a target for antineoplastic drugs [42].

one important role of the enzyme is the channeling
of c1 units of serine (carbon number 3), derived from
intermediates of glycolysis, via 5,10-methylene-thf, into
the folate cycle with the concomitant formation of glycine.
glycine cleavage occurs in only the mitochondria in a four
reaction sequence involving the mitochondrial form of
serine hydroxymethyltransferase [43]. the activity of the
enzyme and degree of metabolism of glycine compared
with serine varies considerably between different tissues
[42]. in the reverse direction of this reaction, thf is regen-
erated from 5,10-methylene-thf, thereby converting gly-
cine to serine and completing the sequence whereby the
possibly toxic formate is converted to serine [38].

5,10-methylene-thf reductase

this enzyme, which catalyzes the nicotinamide ade-
nine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph)-linked reduc-
tion of 5,10-methylene-thf to 5-methyl-thf, has been
purified from pig liver [44] and human liver [45] with
similar properties. the reaction is essentially irreversible
in vivo, and its activity is a control point for entry of
folate coenzymes into the remethylation of homocys-
teine pathway [46]. the purified enzyme is a dimer of
equal subunits of 77 kd molecular mass, each of which
contains one mole of noncovalently bound flavinadenine
dinucleotide. flavin acts as a conductor of reducing
equivalents from nadph to the natural substrate or in
artificial systems to alternative electron acceptors such
as  xxxd2563xxx . the binding of  xxxd3156xxx  re-
sults in allosteric inhibition, which can be reversed by
s-adenosythomocysteine [47]. this inhibition by s-aden-
osylmethionine acts synergistically with the activation of
cystathionine b-synthase and is an important factor in
the regulation of homocysteine metabolism [48].

the studies of rozen and coworkers have consider-

8-225

ably advanced our knowledge of the molecular genetics
of this important enzyme. they first cloned a cdna that
codes for the expected amino acid sequence based on
data from the pig enzyme and maps to 1p36.3 [49]. this
allowed elucidation of different mutations in patients
with homocystinuria caused by severe methylene-thf
reductase deficiency [50]. the cdna of 2.2 kb codes for
a 70 kd protein in an expression system, whereas a
larger enzyme of 77 kd is found in tissues, suggesting
the possibility of tissue-specific methylene-thf reduct-
ase protein isoforms and a complex regulation of the
gene [51].

a thermolabile variant of this enzyme first described
by kang et al [52] is due to a 677 ct transition [53]
and is a common polymorphism with incidences as high
as 23% in some populations [54].

5-methy!l-thf: homocysteine s-methyltransferase
( xxxg1479xxx )

this complex enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a
methyl group from 5-methyl-thf to homocysteine-pro-
ducing methionine and thf, that is, remethylation. the
enzyme plays a vital role in the provision of methionine
for  xxxd3156xxx -dependent transmethylation
reactions. much of our understanding of the mechanism
stems from elegant studies by matthews, and coworkers
on the escherichia coli enzyme {55-s7] as well as infor-
mation on the human placenta [58] and the pig liver
enzymes [59]. the porcine enzyme is a monomer of 151
to 155 kd molecular mass, contains one cobalt atom per
mole of enzyme, and is dependent on s-adenosylmethio-
nine for activity.

cloning of the genes revealed that much homology
exists between the human and e. coli forms, so that
information gained from the extensive studies of the
latter is indeed relevant for the human enzyme. our
present understanding of the catalytic cycle is deduced
from kinetic studies that suggest an ordered sequential
mechanism [60] as well as molecular modeling [55, 56].
in this cycle, the methyl form of the by, coenzyme do-
nates its methyl group to homocysteine yielding the re-
duced form of the coenzyme cob(dalamin and producing
methionine. the cob(1)alamin moeity is remethylated by
5-methyl-thf-forming thf. thus, reductive remethyla-
tion of the cobalamin molecule is a vital part of the reac-
tion, particularly since the  xxxd1771xxx  form occasionally
becomes oxidized to the cob(idalamin form, which is
inactive. the methyl group is donated by s-adenosyl-
methionine in this process, and in e. coli, the electron
is furnished by reduced flavodoxin, a protein lacking in
mammals. until its elucidation (discussed later in this
article), there was much speculation on the nature of the
human reducing component. evidence was obtained that
the mammalian enzyme utilizes two distinct proteins,
s-226

which are not related subunits, to transfer electrons from
nadph to the cobalamin moiety of the enzyme [61].
three independent groups cloned the methionine syn-
thase gene (designated mtr) at the same time, em-
ploying similar approaches and taking advantage of the
highly conserved sequences in bacteria and c. elegans
[62-64]. the cloned human gene encodes a protein of
1265 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of
140 kd and is localized to chromosome 1q42.3-1q44.
mutations in the m7r gene have been identified in sev-
eral patients with the  xxxg1479xxx  form of homocystinuria
caused by  xxxg1479xxx  deficiency [62, 65, 66].
also, the 919 d-g polymorphism of mtr has been
reported to be a determinant of plasma total homocys-
teine concentrations, albeit to a modest degree [67].
an important advance in understanding the methio-
nine synthase function in humans was the discovery of
the gene for  xxxg1479xxx  reductase. leclerc et al
cloned a cdna using consensus sequences for binding of
potential reducing cofactors, fmn, fad, and nadph
[68]. the isolated gene codes a mrna of 3.6 kb and
predicts a protein of molecular mass of 77,000 kd and
698 amino acids belonging to the family of ferredoxin-
nadp + reductases. different mutations in this gene,
including large insertions or deletions caused by splicing
defects and small deletions and point mutations, have
been demonstrated in patients with the  xxxg1480xxx  form of
homocystinuria [69]. this provides conclusive evidence
that this gene and its protein are indeed necessary for
proper function of human  xxxg1479xxx . whether
any additional reducing proteins are necessary for methi-
onine synthase function remains to be established.

metabolic importance of polyglutamate forms

the degree of polygutamylation of coenzymes plays
an important role in the regulation of folate enzymes as
well as in their retention in cells (discussed previously
in this article). for example, the affinity of formyl-thf
synthetase for the substrate thf with four or five gluta-
mate residues is 150 times higher than that for the mo-
noglutamate form of thf. furthermore, the conversion
of glycine to serine by cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl-
transferase was three times higher with substrate con-
taining five glutamate residues than with two [38].

inherited disorders of
folate metabolism

several rare congenital disorders of folate metabolism
are known [1].

hereditary folate malabsorption reported in less than
20 cases exhibits megaloblastic changes, diarrhea, failure
to thrive, and neurological abnormalities in the first few
months of life. serum and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) fo-
late levels are low and respond poorly to oral folate

fowler: folate cycle and disease in humans

treatment. little is known on the molecular defect, but
involvement of a folate transporter seems plausible.

other disorders of folate transport have been reported
such as a postulated defect of 5-methyl-thf uptake of
into bone marrow cells. one patient with dyserythro-
poiesis was shown to have reduced 5-methyl-thf uptake
into erythrocytes.

an adult with progressive sensorineural hearing loss,
dysarthria, dysgraphia, and gait ataxia was shown to have
low folate levels in csf that was postulated to be due
to a defect of a  xxxg807xxx  of the choroid
plexus.

deficiency of dihydro-thf reductase has been re-
ported but not substantiated as an inborn error of metab-
olism [12].

also glutamate formiminotransferase/formimino-thf-
cyclodeaminase deficiency has been observed in both
asymptomatic subjects and in patients with neurological
abnormalities, including three with associated malignancy,
but  xxxd3237xxx  as a cause of clinical abnormalities.

several distinct, rare inherited disorders resulting in
deficient  xxxg1479xxx  activity are known. func-
tional deficiency of this enzyme, either isolated (due to
the  xxxg1480xxx  or cbig cobalamin defects [79]) or combined
with methylmalony! coa mutase deficiency (cbic/d [80]
or cblf defects [81]), leads to severe disease and early
death, sometimes even in treated patients. neurological
abnormalities, feeding difficulties, and delayed develop-
ment, together with megaloblastic anemia, usually mani-
festing in the first weeks or months of life, increased
homocystine with low methionine levels, together with
methylmalonic aciduria in the combined defects are all
hallmarks of this enzyme deficiency.

in both isolated and combined deficiencies, treatment
with high doses of intramuscular hydroxocobalmin usu-
ally leads to a marked improvement of the biochemical
abnormalities, but neurological damage may be irrevers-
ible. as in other remethylation defects, betaine and me-
thionine can be given to increase further the ratio of
methionine to homocysteine as well as  xxxd2146xxx  or folinic
acid.

acquired causes of  xxxg1479xxx  deficiency are
also known, such as exposure to nitrous oxide [82] and
also by deficiency [83].

methylene-thf reductase deficiency is well known as
a cause of severe hyperhomocysteinemia. most patients
have presented between the neonatal period and one
year of age with severe neurological disease, including
seizures, upper motor neuron signs, microcephaly, elec-
troencephalogram (eeg) abnormalities, developmental
delay, and psychomotor retardation. later presenting
patients with milder features, gait abnormalities, and
psychiatric disorder are known. vascular abnormalities
have been identified at post-mortem in some patients [1].

in addition to increased plasma levels of homocystine
fowler: folate cycle and disease in humans

with low methionine, folates can be low in serum, red
cells, or csf reflecting low 5-methyl-thf. although a
few exceptional patients have responded to pharmaco-
logical doses of folate, most are unresponsive to specific
vitamin administration, and treatment is aimed at low-
ering homocysteine and correcting low methionine levels
[1]. most patients have responded poorly to treatment,
and long-term outcome appears to be poor.

finally, although not described in humans, deficiency
of 10 formyl-thf dehydrogenase has been discovered
in a mouse model [84].

conclusion

an important question is whether renal disease per
se can disturb folate metabolism. clearly, if folate status
is affected by poor nutrition or renal loss of water soluble
vitamins, low folate levels may lead to reduced activity of
folate enzymes, including those related to homocysteine
metabolism leading to pathology, for example, anemia.
conversely, if homocysteine elevation occurs because of
a disturbance of metabolism at the level of methylene-
tetrahydrofolate reductase or  xxxg1479xxx , inde-
pendent of folate status, this may lead to disturbed avail-
ability of reduced folates essential for cellular integrity.
there is little evidence that disturbed folate metabolism
in the inherited disorders of folate metabolism causes
renal disease except for the occurrence of hemolytic ure-
mic syndrome in patients with cblc/d disease. however,
this condition has a complex etiology with increased
methylmalonic acid levels as well as deficiency of methio-
nine synthase function.

clearly, much work is still needed to elucidate both
the mechanism for the cause of hyperhomocysteinemia
in renal disease and also the interactions between meta-
bolic changes in renal disease and folate enzymes, consid-
ering possible inhibition of folate enzymes by uremic
compounds.
