role of intraarterial therapy for cerebral vasospasm
secondary to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage

aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) accounts for a significant
percentage of morbidity and mortality among patients admitted to
neurosurgical centers throughout the world. even for individuals surviving
beyond the initial presentation and intervention for aneurysmal sah, the
occurrence of cerebral vasospasm has the potential to induce a second tier of
complications that can be just as devastating as the inciting event. however,
despite numerous studies and some initial advancements in management,
therapeutic modalities are limited to help prevent or treat this complex entity.
historically, the mainstay of treatment for cerebral vasospasm has been a
combination of hypervolemia, hemodilution, and hypertension. in addition,
other systemic therapies such as oral  xxxd2728xxx , statins, and intravenous
magnesium, as well as intensive glucose control, appear to have some
promise, although they are limited at times by adverse effects. to avoid these
adverse consequences and perhaps gain some modicum of efficacy, attempts
have been made to use endovascular techniques to physically dilate vessels or
to administer drugs directly to the site of action and thus avoid many of the
untoward effects of systemic pharmacotherapy. controversy still remains over
the success of intraarterial therapy, the drugs or techniques to be used, and
the best timing of this therapy. based on the currently available literature, it is
impossible to assess the most effective intraarterial therapy. randomized
controlled trials that can control for baseline factors and technical expertise
are needed to provide more conclusive data. clinical pharmacists should be
actively involved in assisting interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons in
providing safe and appropriate pharmacotherapy in this promising but
controversial arena of intraarterial drug delivery.

conclusion

aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah)
accounts for a significant percentage of morbidity
and mortality among patients admitted to
neurosurgical centers throughout the world. in
north america, the estimated annual incidence
of aneurysmal sah is 10–28 events/100,000
people.1 an estimated 10–15% of patients will
die before ever receiving medical attention,
contributing to an overall mortality rate of
32–67%. in addition, of those who survive the
initial insult, 30% will have moderate-to-severe
disability.1, 2

for individuals surviving beyond the initial
presentation and intervention for aneurysmal
sah, the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm has
the potential to induce a second tier of complications. the presence of blood in the subarachnoid space is thought to initiate a cascade of
events resulting in “spasm,” or narrowing of the
cerebral arteries, which may be accompanied by
delayed blood flow, decreased cerebral perfusion,
and ischemic sequelae.3 cerebral vasospasm can
be described as a radiographic or clinical entity.4
radiographic vasospasm is defined as arterial
narrowing noted on cerebral angiograms when
compared with previous angiograms that demonstrated the same vessel with a normal caliber. as
this method enables visualization of only larger
vessels, vasospasm of smaller vessels is often
undiagnosed. in contrast, clinical vasospasm is
defined as a delayed ischemic neurologic deficit
(dind) on physical examination. a noninterventional method sometimes used to aid in
diagnosis is transcranial doppler (tcd) ultrasound measurement.5, 6 the narrowing of the
arterial lumen in vasospasm results in an
elevation in blood flow velocity, which may be
detectable with tcd measurement. this
measurement is highly operator dependent and
may exhibit significant interpatient variability.
since vasospasm was first described in 1951, it
has been the subject of intense research as relates
to the decreased survival for patients with
aneurysmal sah. some have reported that
patients with aneurysmal sah who develop
vasospasm have up to a 3 times higher mortality
rate.7 despite numerous studies and some initial
advancements in management, therapeutic
modalities are limited to help prevent or treat this
often devastating entity.
molecular basis for vasospasm
the inciting events of cerebral vasospasm after
sah remain somewhat unclear. although several
theories exist regarding possible causes, most
experts contend that the presence of subarachnoid
blood is the stimulus for the subsequent cascade

of deleterious events. 8 it is likely that the
presence of this blood initiates a profound
immunologic and inflammatory response that
leads to a dysregulation of the cerebral vasculature.
inflammation is an innate response by which
the body attempts to protect against recognized
antigens. although this response is often
beneficial, in the setting of aneurysmal sah this
process becomes malignant, leading to vascular
spasticity. in the immediate vascular area after
the inciting event, there is an increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules, including
selectins, integrins, and intercellular adhesion
molecules, leading to increased leukocyte
adherence to the endothelium.8 in addition, it
has been found that some cytokines, proteins
that help mediate the immune response, are
upregulated in this setting. not only may the
damaged vessel itself stimulate an inflammatory
response, but also it may be aided by the release
of blood into the extravascular space. erythrocytes
in the cerebrospinal fluid appear to incite an
inflammatory response themselves, recruiting
further activated neutrophils to the area of
damage.8–10
in addition, the liberation of oxyhemoglobin
from erythrocyte breakdown in the cerebral
spinal fluid is associated with vasospasm. one
theory is that the presence of iron in oxyhemoglobin helps to generate free radicals and lipid
peroxides and to bind  xxxd2738xxx . the production of free radicals and enhanced peroxidation
exacerbate the initial damage to vascular smooth
muscle cells and endothelial cells, stimulating the
release of calcium and calmodulin. these latter
two molecules appear to contribute significantly
to altering the balance in favor of vasoconstriction. the ferrous component of hemoglobin
also has a strong binding affinity for  xxxd2738xxx ,
an endogenous vasodilator, thus limiting its
availability and further enhancing the vasoconstrictive state. 9, 10  xxxg674xxx , a potent
vasoconstrictor, has also been proposed to have a
role, as there appears to exist a correlation
between cerebrospinal and plasma levels of
 xxxg674xxx  in the setting of vasospasm after
aneurysmal sah. 11–13 the noted correlation
between the quantity of blood on a computed
tomographic scan and the risk of vasospasm has
led to the development of a grading system for
aneurysmal sah (table 1).14

cerebral vasospasm has been a combination of
hypervolemia, hemodilution, and hypertension
(triple-h therapy). the basis of these interventions
stems from a theoretical division of posseiulle’s
equation of physics stating that the best defense
against constriction of a vessel involves maximal
filling, optimal viscosity, and optimal pressure of
the fluid traveling through it. 15 as a result,
triple-h therapy has been used for years with
relative effectiveness. although data are limited
regarding its success, given its widespread use
among neurosurgical centers, it has become a
standard of care for prevention and treatment of
symptomatic vasospasm. 16 thus, in most
institutions, triple-h therapy is started at the
onset of clinical vasospasm with euvolemia and
the avoidance of anemia or hypotension.15
another agent routinely used in patients with
aneurysmal sah to prevent cerebral vasospasm is
 xxxd2728xxx , a dihydropyridine calcium channel
blocker. it is an l-type, slow-conducting,
voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker that
acts to inhibit the influx of calcium and thus
reduce vasoconstriction.  xxxd2728xxx  is the most
commonly used and studied calcium channel
blocker, in part because it is highly lipid soluble
and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. 17
since 1983, numerous small trials and metaanalyses have investigated the role of  xxxd2728xxx 
in preventing cerebral vasospasm and reducing
ischemic events.18, 19
in the british aneurysm  xxxd2728xxx  trial, 554
patients were randomly assigned to receive either
 xxxd2728xxx  or placebo within 96 hours of
presentation after aneurysmal sah.20 cerebral
infarction was observed in 22% of nimodipinetreated patients compared with 33% in the
control group. the lack of effect on tcd
measurements suggests that perhaps  xxxd2728xxx 
does not have a direct effect on cerebral blood

407

flow. however, it has been postulated to provide
a neuroprotective benefit through modulation of
the increased intracellular calcium concentrations
that have been associated with cell lysis and
death.21 in addition,  xxxd2728xxx  has been found
in other studies to have an inhibitory effect on
thromboxane release, an important factor in
platelet aggregation, potentially leading to
decreased ischemia.22
novel therapies
molecular research into the causes of vasospasm
has led to investigations on whether different
therapies, such as statins, endothelin receptor
antagonists, intravenous magnesium, and
intravenous  xxxd2718xxx , as well as intensive
glucose control, may have therapeutic efficacy in
preventing this complication.23–28 none of these
agents has been fully established as a method for
combating the occurrence and sequelae of
cerebral vasospasm. in addition to questionable
benefit, these therapies also have their own
inherent risks of adverse effects such as hypoglycemia, anemia, and tachycardia. the impact
of some interventions, such as magnesium and
 xxxd2718xxx , is limited due to their systemic
adverse effects such as hypotension, which comes
into direct conflict with traditional triple-h
therapy.24, 29
to avoid these adverse consequences, attempts
have been made to use endovascular techniques
to physically dilate vessels or to administer drugs
directly to the site of action, thus avoiding many
of the untoward effects of these drugs. typically,
endovascular techniques are performed after a
diagnostic cerebral angiogram has demonstrated
significant vasospasm. 30–32 a catheter is then
inserted into the target area in the anterior
circulation and directed proximal to the area of
spasm in the posterior circulation. at this point,
either physical dilation of the vessel using
transluminal balloon angioplasty or pharmacologic
dilation with drugs may be attempted. controversy
still remains over the success of intraarterial
therapy, the drugs or techniques to be used, and
the best timing of this therapy.
intraarterial administration
in theory, the intraarterial approach to drug
delivery would result in high tissue concentrations
at the site of action. however, this advantage can
be diminished in settings of high cerebral blood
flow resulting in lower concentrations at the
intended site of action. in addition, rapid blood

used found increases in cerebral circulation time
in both proximal and distal vessels, suggesting a
positive effect not only in the parent vessel but
also in the capillary beds.36 some have suggested
that the role of this therapy, and that of all
intraarterial therapies, in aneurysmal sah may
be in the treatment of small-vessel vasospasm.
although encouraging, the benefits of intraarterial therapy are not quite so clear. a small
case series demonstrated that an intraarterial
infusion of papaverine 300 mg over 1 hour
increased regional cerebral blood flow from 7.3 to
37.9 ml/100 g/minute. 37 however, within 3
hours, this effect disappeared, as all values
returned to baseline, and subsequently 80% of
the patients tested eventually developed
infarctions in the target territory. therefore, not
only is the selection of an effective agent
essential, but also a thorough understanding of
the pharmacokinetics, dosing, and preparation of
these agents is necessary for the provision of
comprehensive pharmacotherapy.

papaverine is an opium alkaloid, but does not
have significant analgesic activity, as it is structurally unrelated to other opioids. it is a vasodilator that appears to act by phosphodiesterase
inhibition in vascular smooth muscle.38 this is
the basis for its use in intraarterial administration
of cerebral vasospasm. although papaverine
seems to be the earliest and most commonly
reported intraarterial agent for cerebral vasospasm,
little data are available to suggest that it is
actually effective.
although the role of intraarterial papaverine, to
our knowledge, has not been investigated in
prospective randomized studies, numerous
investigators have reported their experiences
with this therapy (table 2).30, 35, 39–61 intraarterial
papaverine appears to consistently increase
cerebral blood flow on angiograms (figure 1).
however, the translation of angiographic improvement to clinical resolution of vasospasm is
lacking. several retrospective studies describe a
supratherapeutic vasodilation of the cerebrovasculature, resulting in increased cerebral blood
volume and a corresponding increase in intracranial pressure. the doses in these investigations
ranged from 140–600 mg, either given in a bolus
or slow infusion fashion. typically, a 0.3%
solution (range 0.1–0.6%) was made with normal
saline and infused at 1–2 ml/minute (range 1–7
ml/min), with boluses infused over 60 seconds.

arterial papaverine fail to show reliable efficacy
for cerebral vasospasm, the frequency of adverse
events is relatively consistent. elevations in
intracranial pressure seem to occur in many
patients, likely due to excessive vasodilation of
large-caliber cerebral vessels, which increases
cerebral blood volume. hemiplegia has also been

411

reported after intraarterial papaverine therapy, as
well as a number of other adverse events such as
agitation, mental status changes, chills, hypotension, seizure, aphasia, papillary dysfunction,
respiratory arrest, and hypertension. most of
these adverse events can be attributable to the
combination of the tenuous clinical state of
cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal sah and the
vasodilatory effects of papaverine. however,
seizures that have occurred after the use of
papaverine in this setting have been noted to
recur with repeat administration, thus demonstrating that this therapy carries its own set of
neurologic adverse effects.62
perhaps more concerning is the direct effect
papaverine may have on the cerebrovasculature.
papaverine may have effects on mitochondrial
respiration, resulting in neurotoxicity. whether
or not this may be more noticeable in patients
receiving relatively high exposure, such as seen
with intraarterial therapy with cells already in a
potentially metabolically stressed state, is
unknown. it should also be noted that highly
concentrated papaverine (0.8–2%) is associated
with a higher risk of temporary deterioration,
making the pharmaceutical preparation of this
product of utmost concern.
when viewed comprehensively, the data
regarding intraarterial papaverine do not show it
as a reliable agent for the treatment of cerebral
vasospasm. the angiographic effects of
papaverine are relatively consistent (figure 1).
in contrast, beneficial clinical effects are
sporadic, and the durability of response is
questionable. the likelihood of adverse events
appears to be high, and many of the adverse
events reported are severe and can worsen an
already complicated clinical situation.
 xxxd2718xxx 
 xxxd2718xxx  is a dihydropyridine calcium
channel blocker that reduces the influx of
calcium through the l-type calcium channels in
vascular smooth muscle.38  xxxd2718xxx  is much
more water soluble than most dihydropyridine
calcium channel blockers, which, among other
factors, allows for a relatively convenient
parenteral formulation. other pharmacologic
factors, such as vascular specificity, also make
this drug attractive for use in patients with
cerebral vasospasm.  xxxd2718xxx  appears to have
a higher affinity for cardiac and cerebral vascular
smooth muscle than comparable calcium channel
blockers; thus, theoretically, the drug should be

412

pharmacotherapy volume 30, number 4, 2010

more effective for ischemic or vasoconstrictive
conditions in these vessels.
in addition to vascular specificity,  xxxd2718xxx 
is a zwitterion with a pka of 7.2. therefore, at
the typical physiologic ph, the molecular charge
is neutral, allowing for widespread distribution,
even into the central compartment. however, in
areas of ischemia (such as might be seen with
cerebral vasospasm or stroke),  xxxd2718xxx  is
more commonly protonated, allowing for
accumulation at those sites. this may impart a
significant ability to vasodilate ischemic areas.
this accumulation may also allow for a slightly
prolonged pharmacologic half-life in these areas.
several studies have documented systemic
 xxxd2718xxx  use in the prevention of cerebral
vasospasm as well as intraarterial  xxxd2718xxx  use
for the treatment of vasospasm.27, 28, 46, 47 like
papaverine,  xxxd2718xxx  appears to vasodilate
cerebral vessels during periods of vasospasm, as
manifested by decreases in cerebral blood flow
velocity (decreased tcd mean and peak systolic
velocity measurements). to our knowledge, no
prospective randomized data exist supporting the
use of  xxxd2718xxx , either by intravenous or
intraarterial infusion, for the treatment of
vasospasm. the available clinical evidence does
suggest that angiographic measures of vasospasm
may be improved after infusion. numerically,
this improvement appears to be more consistent
than that with papaverine, although no direct

comparison has been made of the therapies.
typical total doses used in these various
investigations ranged from 5–40 mg.  xxxd2718xxx 
was prepared by diluting the drug with normal
saline to a concentration of 0.83–1 mg/ml and
administering 0.5–1 ml over 60 seconds.
 xxxd2718xxx  may have adverse effects when
infused intraarterially. much like papaverine,
vasodilation by  xxxd2718xxx  may increase cerebral
blood volume and thus intracranial pressure.
systemic intravenous administration (or higher
doses of intraarterial infusions) may result in
hypotension, which may be deleterious in
patients experiencing true cerebral vasospasm.
in addition,  xxxd2718xxx  solution for injection
also contains 4.8% sorbitol as a cosolvent.
although this is a relatively small amount
compared with doses used experimentally for
intracranial pressure control, the impact of this
excipient in the setting of vasospasm and when
administered intraarterially is poorly understood.
 xxxd2728xxx 
 xxxd2728xxx  is a dihydropyridine calcium
channel blocker that reduces the influx of
calcium through the l-type calcium channels in
smooth muscle cells. as stated previously, the
use of oral  xxxd2728xxx  has decreased the frequency
of vasospasm.18, 20 like  xxxd2718xxx ,  xxxd2728xxx 
appears to have a specific preference for the

cerebrovasculature. however,  xxxd2728xxx  is
practically insoluble in water, making the formulation of a pharmaceutically convenient solution
for injection much more difficult. the formulation
available in other countries contains 25%
volume:volume ethanol and 15% volume: volume
 xxxd2982xxx -400. currently, intravenous
 xxxd2728xxx  is not approved or available in the
united states.  xxxd2728xxx  infusions, like other
calcium channel blockers, do cause hypotension,
and this has been reported in many of the published retrospective analyses describing intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  use. it is unclear how the
additional ingredients in the intravenous
preparation impact these adverse effects. limited
other adverse effects have been described.
intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  has been administered
in a number of studies (table 2),48–51 although no
high-level evidence exists supporting its use.
only one study was prospective in nature, but it
was also open-label and lacked a control group.51
numerous other retrospective case series of
intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  have been published.
reports vary as to whether the  xxxd2728xxx 
therapy was administered during endovascular
securing of the aneurysm (as prophylaxis or
treatment in patients’ delayed therapy) or as
primary therapy for cerebral vasospasm. in
general, angiographic reversal or mitigation of
vasospasm appears relatively common with
intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx , as does some clinical
improvement. of interest, one study reported
that despite only 43% of patients having obvious
angiographic improvement after intraarterial
 xxxd2728xxx  therapy, 76% of the patients exhibited some improvement in clinical vasospasm
symptoms.50 this is intriguing given the similar
trend of the results of studies on oral  xxxd2728xxx 
for vasospasm prevention, in which many
subjects did not exhibit alterations in tcd
measurements but did have improved neurologic
outcomes.18–20 it is conceivable that the putative
neuroprotective effects of  xxxd2728xxx  may play a
role in acute reversal of vasospasm, as well as in
the short-term prophylaxis used with a 21-day
oral regimen. in two of the investigations,
 xxxd2728xxx  was prepared by diluting 1–2 mg in
25–30 ml of normal saline and was infused over
15 minutes. 48, 49 other investigations administered  xxxd2728xxx  by a continuous infusion at a
rate of 0.07–0.1 mg/minute.50, 51
verapamil
verapamil is a benzylalkylamine calcium

413

channel blocker that has been shown to reduce
the influx of calcium through the l-type calcium
channels in smooth muscle cells. 38 although
verapamil appears to have little specificity for the
cerebrovasculature, it is an agent that has been
widely used to treat coronary vasospasm and,
therefore, its use has been extrapolated to the
treatment of cerebral vasospasm.63–65
the evidence surrounding verapamil with
regard to intraarterial use for cerebral vasospasm
is much like many of the other calcium channel
blockers: limited prospective data exist, some
reports demonstrate clinical success to varying
degrees, vasodilation is inconsistently exhibited
as measured by tcd, and systemic hypotensive
effects are possible, as is increased intracranial
pressure. substantial variation exists regarding
the dosing of this agent (total doses of 1–41
mg/procedure).52, 53 typically, a 5% solution was
prepared, with boluses of 1–2 mg given every 30
minutes.52 one study increased this up to 5 mg
every 1–2 minutes. 53 as verapamil has more
effects on cardiac automaticity, decreases in heart
rate have also been reported after intraarterial
use. of note, one recent case report described
the development of tonic-clonic seizure after
intraarterial verapamil administration.66
transluminal balloon angioplasty
transluminal balloon angioplasty is a common
intervention used to treat refractory vasospasm in
patients with peripheral arteriosclerotic
obstructions; however, it was not until 1984 when
it was first used in the treatment of vasospasm
secondary to aneurysmal sah.67 the mechanism
by which mechanical disruption of the intracranial
tree reestablishes distal perfusion is poorly
understood but likely involves mechanical
disruption of smooth muscle cells or the ionic
connections between the basement membranes of
the cells. although endoluminal injury has been
known to occur during angioplasty, it is likely
transient, and the effects result in durable dilation
of the vessel with resultant increase in distal
perfusion (figure 2).68, 69
the technique of cerebral angioplasty varies,
but it generally involves navigation into the
spastic vessel by using a microcatheter-mounted
balloon filled with contrast material and
subsequent inflation under direct angiographic
visualization. modern balloons navigate the
intracranial circulation more easily, offer better
compliance, and have more uniform and
consistent inflation pressures than many of the

414

pharmacotherapy volume 30, number 4, 2010

coronary balloons that were used in early case
reports.70 although this technique has been used
to effectively dilate vasospastic proximal vessels
such as the supraclinoid carotid artery, proximal
m1 segments of the middle cerebral artery
(proximal to the middle cerebral artery bifurcation),
the m2 segments (distal to the middle cerebral
artery bifurcation), the proximal posterior
cerebral arteries, the basilar artery, vertebral
arteries, and occasionally a1 of the anterior
cerebral segments, it has size limitations with
regard to dilating smaller distal vessels of the
arterial tree.
despite early studies showing variable
responses to angioplasty, recent studies indicate
that angioplasty, when offered in a timely manner
(within 2 hrs71 or up to 24 hrs55 after vasospasm),
results in angiographic and clinical improvements in vasospasm. in addition, studies show a
decreased frequency of stroke in the treated
territory affected by vasospasm. prophylactic
angioplasty, however, does not appear to confer
benefit in patients with moderate-grade sah,
based on recent phase ii data from randomized
controlled trials.72, 73
devastating complications of balloon-directed
therapies do occur and include vessel perforation, misplacement of the balloon due to
inadequate contrast visualization of the arterial
tree or patient motion artifact, vessel thrombosis
or vessel dissection, and reperfusion-related
hemorrhage. these risks are minimized by
meticulous blood pressure control, patient
monitoring, induction of anesthesia, and careful
review of baseline angiograms. in addition, the
long-term effects of these treatments are unclear,

a

as is how to combine intraarterial drugs and
balloon-directed therapies. 38, 74 for further
information on this technique and associated
outcomes, the reader is directed to many
publications regarding this topic.38, 60, 67, 70, 74
role of the pharmacist and future research
the available clinical literature regarding the
use of intraarterial therapies for the treatment of
cerebral vasospasm consists largely of
retrospective analyses and anecdotal reports. as
such, assessments of the overall success of these
therapies, even compared with current standards
of care, are difficult to determine in the absence
of control groups. taken alone, the highest
clinical recovery rates appear to be associated
more with transluminal balloon angioplasty (up
to 100%); however, this is tempered by reports
from one study that noted no significant
difference in tcd measurement reduction
between pharmacologic and physical vasodilation
(p=0.5509).60
the clinical pharmacist can and should have
an essential role in providing intraarterial
pharmacotherapy. because of the urgency with
which these intraarterial drugs are needed, in
addition to the lack of data and general
knowledge of drug utilization in this arena, it is a
process that can be fraught with error. if these
agents are used, the clinical pharmacist,
interventional radiologist, and neurosurgeon
should develop protocols to ensure safe and
appropriate prescribing. in addition, processes
should be implemented to ensure accurate and
sterile drug product admixture as well as efficient

room.
much of the difficulty in assessing the most
effective therapy stems from the complicated
nature of cerebral vasospasm and our fundamental lack of understanding regarding its
etiology, diagnosis, and clinical course. this
becomes evident when evaluating the available
studies, as they use various definitions of clinical
vasospasm (e.g., dind, tcd, angiographic data),
baseline severity of illness (i.e., hunt and hess
grade, fisher grade, world federation of
neurological surgeons grade, glasgow coma
score), interventional strategies (i.e., prophylactic, treatment, combination), and measurements of success (i.e., dind, tcd, angiographic
improvement). although it is impossible to
control for every individual factor in a study,
randomized control trials provide one avenue for
ensuring that a minimal level of bias exists with
all these factors. in the absence of these trials,
however, all of these factors are equally present
and can have an equally large impact on therapy.
future studies should be designed in a
randomized fashion with clearly established
treatment protocols and quantitative clinical and
radiologic end points. for pharmacologic
investigations, standard and consistent dosing
and administration are necessary to evaluate
overall efficacy. studies should attempt to focus
on the use of a single agent, rather than various
combinations, in order to isolate the beneficial or
harmful agent. in addition to short-term clinical
outcomes, these investigations must include
longer term outcomes such as dind, intensive
care unit and hospital length of stay, and
rehabilitation time.
conclusion
based on the available literature, it is impossible to assess the most effective intraarterial
therapy to prevent or treat cerebral vasospasm
resulting from aneurysmal sah. the most
encouraging therapy appears to be early
intervention (< 24 hrs after aneurysmal sah)
with transluminal balloon angioplasty. however,
this is tempered by the fact that the full adverseeffect profile and operator dependency need
further exploration. also, this therapy may only
yield positive results in proximal vasospasm and
will be completely ineffective in distal vasospasm.
at that point, intraarterial chemical dilation may
be considered; however, determination of which
agent to use and the necessity for intracranial

415

pressure monitoring need further exploration. in
the presence of a combination of proximal and
distal vasospasm, the question remains as to the
efficacy, and danger, of using one or both
therapies for treatment. these questions can be
resolved only through randomized controlled
trials that can control for baseline factors and
technical expertise.
