abstract
appropriate expression of the  xxxg931xxx  ( xxxg931xxx ) in
gonadotropes is critical for gnrh signaling and hence for gonadotropin secretion and sexual development. in the present
work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels in pituitaries of male rats from day 5 to day 55,
when sexual maturity is attained. developmental changes of gonadotropin subunit (a, fshb, and lhb) mrna levels were also
assessed. in addition, the role of the endogenous gnrh on the
maturational changes of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit
gene expression was investigated. messenger rna levels were
determined by northern blot analysis of total rna from anterior
pituitaries. amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kb)  xxxg931xxx 
mrna increased slowly from day 5 through the infantile and
the juvenile periods, to peak at day 35 (12-fold increase vs. day
5). thereafter, the levels of the  xxxg931xxx  mrna decline slightly
until day 55 (33% decrease vs. day 35). parallel changes were
observed on the 4.5-kb transcript of the  xxxg931xxx  gene. alpha
subunit mrna was easily detected at day 5, and its levels increased progressively through the infantile period (2.5-fold increase) and peaked at day 25 (3.3-fold increase vs. day 5) with
a smooth nonstatistically significant increment until day 35;
then it decreased by 41.5% at day 55. fshb and lhb mrna
levels rose slowly until day 25. a sharp rise occurred thereafter
to reach maximum levels at day 35 (5.8-fold for fshb and 3.8fold for lhb vs. day 25). thereafter, the levels of both mrnas
fell until day 55 (44.1% decrease for fshb and 37.1% decrease
for lhb vs. day 35). to ascertain whether developmental activation of the  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit gene expression
is gnrh dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the
endogenous gnrh action by treating developing male rats with
the specific gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx  (1.5 mg/kg body weight/
week, s.c.) through the infantile (days 5–20) and the juvenile
periods (days 20–35).  xxxd466xxx  completely blocked the rise of
levels of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of
the  xxxg931xxx  mrna, during both the infantile and the juvenile
periods.  xxxd466xxx  also abolished the developmental rise of the
gonadotropin b subunit mrnas during the two periods of the

endocrine society, san diego, ca, 12–15 june 1999, and at the 82nd
annual meeting of the endocrine society, toronto, on, canada, 21–24

study. in contrast, the  xxxg220xxx  gene expression was not altered
by  xxxd466xxx  treatment during any of the two periods. these data
demonstrate that sexual maturation of male rats is accompanied
by a progressive and concerted induction of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit gene expression. developmental activation
of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin b subunit genes is gnrh dependent. the apparent gnrh-independent regulation of the a-glycoprotein subunit mrna levels may be due to the contribution
of thyrotropes and perhaps to the presence of exclusive regulatory signals for this gene.

gene expression,  xxxg931xxx , pubertal development

introduction
pubertal development in mammals results from a complex cascade of progressive maturational events involving
the entire gonadal axis. it is heralded by increasing pulsatile
secretion of gonadotropins in response to augmented pulsatile gnrh secretion. the  xxxg931xxx  ( xxxg931xxx )
plays an essential role in this process, allowing gnrh signaling to the gonadotrope cell.
based on endocrinological and morphological landmarks, the postnatal development of the male rat has been
divided into several phases [1]. the first week after birth
is considered as the neonatal period, a period during which
the hypophysial portal system becomes established and the
gonocytes in the seminiferous tubules terminate their period
of mitotic quiescence. the infantile period extends from
day 7 to day 21, when sertoli cells stop dividing, the
blood-testis barrier becomes established, and serum fsh
levels begin to increase. the juvenile period begins at day
21 and ends at day 35, when serum fsh levels become
maximally elevated and serum testosterone levels begin to
rise. the pubertal period is initiated at day 35 and ends
around day 55–60, when mature sperm are observed in the
vas deferens.
several aspects of the maturational changes in the hypothalamic-gonadotrope cell unit of male rats have already
been described. hypothalamic prognrh mrna levels increase steadily (;3-fold) during the first 45 days of life [2]
and are accompanied by parallel changes in hypothalamic
gnrh content [3, 4]. moreover, the pituitary content of
fsh and lh increases with age, reaching maximum levels
at days 40–50 [5]. also, ligand binding studies have demonstrated that the number of gnrh receptors in male rat
pituitaries increases progressively during neonatal [6], infantile, and juvenile prepubertal stages, peaking at day 30–
35 (;2-fold) [7, 8]. although activation of the  xxxg931xxx 
gene expression could be the most likely responsible for
this increase, other mechanisms either at the translational
(altered mrna translational efficiency) or at posttranslational levels (i.e., receptor recycling or degradation) can be
involved. in this regard, it has been reported that gnrh is
able to increase the  xxxg931xxx  number on the surface of the

1764

 xxxg931xxx  gene expression during puberty

1765

murine cell line  xxxg2056xxx  [9] without changes on the  xxxg931xxx 
mrna levels. moreover, in the same cell line, other authors
showed that gnrh increases protein synthesis through a
cap-dependent activation of mrna translation [10]. since
the  xxxg931xxx  gene has been cloned, several works performed in vitro have demonstrated that its expression is
directly regulated by two signals, pulsatile gnrh in primary pituitary cultures [11, 12] and activin in the murine
gonadotrope cell line  xxxg2056xxx  [13, 14], pulsatile gnrh being
the most relevant one. because pubertal development is accompanied by increased pulsatile gnrh secretion, this presumably leads to an activation of pituitary  xxxg931xxx  gene
expression. in order to contribute to a better understanding
of the molecular basis of pubertal development, we have
investigated the ontogeny of the steady-state  xxxg931xxx 
mrna levels in pituitaries of male rats from the infantile
period to sexual maturation. also, changes of the gonadotropin subunit (a, lhb, and fshb) mrna levels were assessed in parallel with those of the  xxxg931xxx . finally, to
confirm that developmental changes of the  xxxg931xxx  and
gonadotropin subunit gene expression are gnrh dependent, we have studied the effect of  xxxd466xxx , a specific
gnrh antagonist [15–17] on the pubertal regulation of the
 xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit mrna levels.

twenty micrograms of total rna were electrophoresed on denaturing
1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. rna was transferred onto a
duralon uv nylon membrane (stratagene, la jolla, ca) by diffusion blotting [19]. each blot was hybridized with a [p]dctp-labeled rat  xxxg931xxx 
cdna probe [20] using conditions previously described [21]. blots were
washed, subjected to autoradiography, and subsequently stripped off radioactivity and rehybridized with specific [p]dctp-labeled rat cdna
probes for fshb, lhb, and a glycoprotein subunit. differences in total
rna loading among samples were corrected by  xxxg798xxx  mrna quantitation in the same samples. the mrna levels were estimated on the
basis of the intensity of the hybridization signal quantitated by a densitometer.

materials and methods

serum gonadotropin and testosterone

experimental design

serum lh and fsh were determined by ria using reagents generously supplied by dr. a.f. parlow (national hormone and pituitary program). lh-rp3 and fsh-rp2 were used as reference preparations. lh
and fsh were iodinated by the chloramine t method, and specific rias
were performed according to the procedure recommended by the national
institutes of health. the intraassay variations were 8% and 7% for lh
and fsh, respectively. serum total and free testosterone were measured
by ria using commercial kits obtained from diagnostic products corporation dpc (los angeles, ca). the intraassay variations for total testosterone assay were 5% for total testosterone concentrations of 100–400
ng/dl, 10% for concentrations of 50–100 ng/dl, and 15% for concentrations
of 10–20 ng/dl. the intraassay variation for free testosterone assay was
4%. all samples from the same experiment were analyzed in duplicate in
one assay.

for the ontogenic studies, male rats aged 5 (neonatal-infantile transition), 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55 days (sexually mature
rats) were used. in order to obtain sufficient sample for analysis, anterior
pituitaries from several rats were pooled as follows: day 5, six animals/
pool; day 10, four animals/pool; days 15–25, three animals/pool; days
30–55, two animals/pool. sera were pooled as follows: day 5, four rats/
pool; day 10, three rats/pool; days 15–25, two rats/pool. from days 30–
55, hormone levels were determined in serum samples from individual
rats. total rna from four pools of anterior pituitaries per age group was
extracted by the method of chomczynski and sacchi [18] and analyzed
by northern blot. gonadotropin and total and free testosterone levels were
measured in pooled sera (six pools/age group) by specific rias.
to investigate the gnrh dependency of gonadotrope gene expression
during both the infantile and juvenile stages of sexual development, two
sets of experiments were conducted by using the specific gnrh antagonist
 xxxd466xxx . in the first set, looking at the infantile period, 5-day-old male
rats were treated by weekly s.c. injection (days 5, 12, and 19) of either
vehicle or  xxxd466xxx  acetate (1.5 mg/kg body weight [bw]) according to
the manufacturers recommendations to avoid unnecessarily more frequent
injections. the last dose of  xxxd466xxx  was administered the day before
decapitation to assure appropriate blockade. both groups of rats, vehicleand  xxxd466xxx -treated, were killed on day 20. nontreated 5-day-old male
rats were killed to serve as controls of gonadotrope gene expression at
this age. in the second set of experiments, 20-day-old male rats were
treated as above until day 35 (injections on days 20, 27, and 34) (juvenile
period). each experimental group consisted of six pools of 2 animals, as
described for the ontogenic studies. the animals were killed on day 35.
a group of nontreated 20-day-old rats was killed and used as controls of
gonadotrope gene expression at this age. anterior pituitaries were removed
to analyze gonadotrope gene expression by northern blot and trunk blood
was collected for hormone assays.

animals
male wistar rats, 5–55 days old, were obtained from iffa-credo
(charles river laboratories, barcelona, spain). five-day-old male rats
were delivered to our laboratory on day 4. the other age groups were
delivered 4 days before decapitation and were maintained in a 12l:12d
cycle at 248c with food and water ad libitum, either with their respective
mothers (groups of 10–20 days) or housed in groups of 3 animals/cage
(25–55 days). for gnrh antagonist experiments, male rats aged 4 (for the
infantile period) or 16 days (for the juvenile period) were delivered to our
laboratory with their mothers and maintained as above until the day they
were killed. all animals were killed by decapitation after ether anesthesia

between 9 and 10 h; trunk blood was collected for hormone assays and
sera were stored at 2208c until assayed. the anterior pituitaries were
separated from the intermediate and posterior lobes, frozen on dry ice, and
stored at 2808c until assayed. the experimental protocol described within
this article was approved by the animal research committee of our institution.

gnrh antagonist
as a gnrh antagonist, we used  xxxd466xxx  acetate (sb-75), generously
provided by asta medica (frankfurt/main, germany). for injection,  xxxd466xxx  was dissolved in distilled water containing 5% mannitol and administered s.c. through a 22-gauge needle.

northern blot analysis

statistical analysis
data are expressed as the mean 6 sd. statistical analysis of ontogeny
experiments was performed by using one-way anova. those experiments where the effects of two factors (age and  xxxd466xxx  treatment) were
studied, the two-way anova was performed. in both cases, the bonferroni posttest was used to establish the level of significance between a pair
of groups. statistics were done with the prism program (graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca). a p value less than 0.05 was considered
significant.

results

 xxxg931xxx  mrna levels

the two major species of  xxxg931xxx  mrna, 5.0 and 4.5
kb, were present in the pituitaries of 5-day-old male pups.
as shown in figure 1, the levels of both transcripts increased very slowly through the infantile period. a more
rapid rise occurred through the juvenile period to peak at
day 35. thereafter, the levels of both transcripts declined
slightly until day 55. the other two much less abundant
transcripts, 2.5 and 1.3 kb, were almost undetectable and
therefore their levels were not quantitated.
gonadotropin subunit mrna levels

as shown in figure 2, the  xxxg220xxx  mrna was easily

nonstatistically significant increase occurred to day 35.
thereafter, the levels fell to day 55. fshb and lhb mrna
levels increased slowly until day 25, when the levels of
both mrnas rose sharply to peak at day 35 (fig. 2). then
the levels of both mrnas declined to day 55.
serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels
as shown in figure 3, serum fsh levels showed a tendency to decrease from day 5 to day 15, with a progressive
rise until day 45, 10 days after the peak of the fshb
mrna. in contrast, the circulating lh levels were quite
variable and did not show significant changes with increasing age. serum total testosterone was barely detectable during neonatal and infantile periods and was undetected from
day 25 to day 35, when it began to rise until day 50 (fig.
3b). serum-free testosterone levels paralleled those of total
testosterone until day 45 and remained unchanged thereafter (fig. 3b).

male rats were treated either with vehicle or the gnrh
antagonist  xxxd466xxx  during the infantile and juvenile stages
of prepubertal development. as shown in figure 4,  xxxd466xxx  treatment completely abolished the rise of the two
major species of the  xxxg931xxx  mrna during the two periods of the study.

 xxxd466xxx  treatment abated serum lh and fsh concentrations to very low or undetectable levels in both the infantile and the juvenile periods of pubertal development

discussion

to our knowledge, the present work shows, for the first
time, the developmental changes in  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit mrna levels in male rats from day 5 to
sexual maturity. the  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels increased progressively and markedly through the infantile and juvenile
periods until the time of puberty. this increase is slow
through the first part of the infantile period and accelerates
during the second part of the infantile and during the juvenile period. this supports the idea that pubertal activation
of  xxxg931xxx  gene expression is the major mechanism by
which the gonadotrope cell increases the number of  xxxg931xxx  during sexual development. also, the pattern of the

 xxxg931xxx  gene activation suggests that pubertal development in male rats occurred in a progressive manner, starting
in the postnatal period and showing an intriguing peak
model of regulation during peripuberty. the levels of the
two major transcripts of the  xxxg931xxx  gene, 5.0 and 4.5 kb
[20, 22], rose in parallel to peak at day 35, well before
complete sexual maturation was attained but when serum
fsh levels are close to maximum. this is in good correlation with previously reported ontogenetic profiles of the
number of pituitary gnrh receptors in male rats, as determined by gnrh-binding studies [7, 8]. furthermore, both
mrna levels and  xxxg931xxx  number smoothly declined after
day 35, when serum testosterone started to rise, as shown
in the present work and in other studies [7, 8, 23–25]. this
inverse correlation suggests that androgens produced by the
maturating testes, acting as negative feedback on gnrh
secretion, could be responsible for this small decline on the

 xxxg931xxx  gene expression after day 35. additionally, this
ontogenetic pattern of  xxxg931xxx  gene expression shows
good parallelism with prognrh mrna levels in the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamic region of the rat brain [2]
and also with hypothalamic gnrh content measured by
ria [3, 4].
the ontogenetic patterns of gonadotropin b subunit gene
expression are quite similar to those of the  xxxg931xxx  gene.
however, the juvenile acceleration started several days later
than the  xxxg931xxx  mrna. this fact is not surprising taking
into account that appropriate expression of gnrh receptors
in gonadotropes may allow the subsequent expression of
gonadotropin subunits in response to gnrh. again, the
progressive increase of serum testosterone, acting as negative feedback on gnrh secretion, may explain the decline
of gonadotropin b subunit mrnas that occurred after day
35. the levels of glycoprotein  xxxg220xxx  mrna behave
slightly different than those of b subunits.  xxxg216xxx 
mrna was easily detected during the neonatal period, and
a more rapid increase is observed around day 15 (the infantile-juvenile transition) and peaks at day 25. these divergent patterns of mrna levels between a and b subunits
may be due to different pulse frequency of gnrh at different developmental stages, favoring  xxxg220xxx  mrna accumulation. in this regard, it has been reported that 8-min
gnrh pulse intervals increased a and had little or no effect
on lhb and fshb mrna in vitro [26]. in addition, a
subunit gene expression in thyrotropes (not regulated by
gnrh) can account for this different pattern of the  xxxg220xxx  gene expression. the temporal sequence of gonadotropin subunit gene expression, being  xxxg220xxx  first, followed
by lhb and fshb, seems to fit with the embryonic ontogenetic pattern of expression of the three subunits [27, 28].
pituitary weight increases 3- to 4-fold from infancy to puberty [7]. literature about the relative contribution of different cell populations to total pituitary cellular mass during
ontogeny is scarce [29], but some studies pointed out that
gnrh is mitogenic for gonadotrophs in vitro [30]. therefore, it is possible that populations of gonadotropes are relatively more represented in the anterior pituitary during puberty, contributing, at least in part, to the dramatic elevation
of the gonadotrope mrnas observed in the present work.
in fact, anterior pituitaries of male rats treated with  xxxd466xxx  weigh ;15% less than controls (data not shown). on
the other hand, anesthetics, including ether, can affect the
expression of several genes. however, with the exception
of early immediate genes, it is unlike that measurements of
other mrnas, such as  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit,
could be affected because tissues were obtained and frozen
less than 3 min after ether exposure.
the developmental pattern of circulating fsh levels was
similar to that previously reported, with relatively low levels during infancy, to increase markedly during the juvenile
and pubertal stages (for a review, see [1]). in contrast, as
previously reported [1], lh levels are more variable and
do not show a clear pattern. luteinizing hormone pulsatility, more evident than that of fsh, may contribute to this
variability. even though it has been published that longterm (hours) exposure to ether anesthesia can alter gonadotropin levels in rats, other studies show no differences after brief (up to 30 min) exposures [31, 32]. thus, it is
unlikely that anesthesia affected lh and fsh levels in the
present work.
inasmuch as pulsatile gnrh is the major positive regulatory signal for  xxxg931xxx  gene expression, presumably

development is due to the progressive increase of endogenous gnrh secretion as young male rats approach sexual
maturity. our data show that the specific gnrh antagonist
 xxxd466xxx  completely prevents the rise of levels of both
 xxxg931xxx  gene transcripts during the infantile and juvenile
periods. this unequivocally proves that progressive developmental activation of the  xxxg931xxx  gene expression in
male rats is entirely gnrh dependent, even at very early
stages of development such as during the infantile period.
this is in agreement with previous works indicating that
chronic administration of  xxxd466xxx  to adult male rats
caused a marked decrease in the  xxxg931xxx  number [33] as
well as in the levels of  xxxg931xxx  mrna [15] by counteracting the stimulatory effect of endogenous gnrh [16, 17].
also, it has been reported that chronic  xxxd466xxx  treatment
of female rats from day 25 to day 36 down-regulates (by
50%) the expression of the  xxxg931xxx  gene measured by
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) assay [34]. however, another report, also using
rt-pcr, showed that  xxxg931xxx  as well as gonadotropin b
subunit mrnas were not affected by treatment of infantile
female rats with a gnrh antagonist [35]. these different
responses can be attributed to sexual dimorphism and to
different experimental protocols, such us different antagonists and different developmental periods of treatment.
although not evaluated in the present work, evidence
from in vitro studies showing that gnrh up-regulates the
 xxxg931xxx  mrna through transcriptional activation rather
than modulation of the mrna stability [36] suggests that
developmental up-regulation of  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels by
endogenous gnrh takes place mainly at the transcriptional
level.
in a similar manner as occurred with the  xxxg931xxx  gene,
 xxxd466xxx  completely prevented the developmental up-regulation of gonadotropin b subunit mrnas during both the
infantile and juvenile prepubertal periods. this is congruent
with the overwhelming evidence from in vivo and in vitro
experiments indicating that lhb and fshb gene expression
is gnrh dependent [37–41]. also, the dramatic inhibition
of fshb mrna levels by  xxxd466xxx  suggests that pituitary
and gonadal activin is not a major contributor to the activation of the fshb gene expression in the prepubertal pe-

riod. however, a caveat to this conclusion must be introduced because significant evidence indicates that gnrh
can indirectly regulate the fshb gene through induction of
activin and  xxxg816xxx  genes [42]. in agreement with the
blocking effect on gonadotropin b subunit gene expression,
 xxxd466xxx  also abated serum lh and fsh concentrations
and aborted the initial rise of serum total and free testosterone levels. in contrast with the gonadotropin b subunits,
the gnrh antagonist did not affect  xxxg220xxx  mrna levels
during either the infantile or the juvenile periods. this observation was, in some ways, unexpected in light of the
numerous reports showing a gnrh dependence of  xxxg220xxx  gene expression in vivo, explored with gnrh antagonist treatment [37, 39, 41]. this different behavior of the
 xxxg220xxx  gene may be explained, at least partially, by the
contribution of the  xxxg220xxx  mrna expressed in thyrotropes (not regulated by gnrh). alternatively, other signals
that could affect selectively the  xxxg220xxx  gene expression
may overcome the blocking effect of  xxxd466xxx  on the
gnrh-regulated  xxxg220xxx  gene expression during sexual
maturation.
in summary, this study shows that sexual development
in male rats is accompanied by a progressive and concerted
activation of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit genes in
the anterior pituitary through the infantile and juvenile periods to puberty. this seems to be the major mechanism
for the augmented synthesis of  xxxg931xxx  number and gonadotropin subunits during sexual maturation of male rats.
developmental activation of the expression of the  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin b subunit genes is gnrh dependent.
the apparent gnrh-independent activation of  xxxg220xxx 
gene expression may be due to the contribution of  xxxg220xxx 
mrna from thyrotropes. additionally, this gives rise to the
question of whether other specific regulatory signals for the
pituitary  xxxg220xxx  gene expression, aside from gnrh and
trh, could have a role.
