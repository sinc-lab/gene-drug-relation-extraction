comparison of ophthalmic beta-blocking agents.  glaucoma is described, and the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of betaxolol and  xxxd2467xxx  in comparison with  xxxd3377xxx  are reviewed. betaxolol and  xxxd2467xxx  are two beta-adrenergic blocking agents being marketed as ophthalmic solutions for treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (poag) and ocular hypertension ( xxxd3285xxx ). betaxolol is a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, while  xxxd2467xxx  is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. double-blind comparative trials have suggested that betaxolol has an equal to slightly lower efficacy and  xxxd2467xxx  has equal efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure (iop) compared with  xxxd3377xxx , the first ophthalmic beta blocker. a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 15-35% occurs with both betaxolol and  xxxd2467xxx  and is reported to be maintained with prolonged use. betaxolol is associated with a higher (25%) incidence of local ocular adverse reactions than  xxxd3377xxx . however, betaxolol produces less systemic beta 2- and possibly beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade than either  xxxd3377xxx  or  xxxd2467xxx . betaxolol may be relatively safer to use in patients with reactive airway disease than either  xxxd3377xxx  or  xxxd2467xxx .  xxxd2467xxx  causes a similar to greater incidence of local ocular adverse reactions and similar systemic beta blockade compared with  xxxd3377xxx .  xxxd2467xxx  may possibly be longer acting than  xxxd3377xxx , allowing more patients to be controlled by once-daily dosing. betaxolol and  xxxd2467xxx  appear to be similar to  xxxd3377xxx  in controlling iop in patients with poag and  xxxd3285xxx ; additional experience with these agents is needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each agent.
