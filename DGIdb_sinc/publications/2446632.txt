abstract-the interaction of 12 phenoxypropanolamines,
all ligands with high affinity towards /3adrenoceptors, with the [3h]batrachotoxinin a 20-cy-benzoate ([3h] xxxd360xxx ) binding site on voltagesensitive sodium channels in a rat brain synaptosomal preparation, was studied as a measure for local
anaesthetic activity. all derivatives are capable of displacing [3h] xxxd360xxx  from its specific binding site,
 xxxd2869xxx  displaying the highest affinity. multiple regression analyses were performed, correlating
biological activity ( pki values) with physicochemical parameters. lipophilicity is of prime importance
in the established regression equations, but steric factors are relevant as well. comparisons were made
with analogous equations relating /ii- and &-adrenoceptor affinity with physicochemical parameters,
leading to the conclusion that “cardioselective” /i-adrenoceptor ligands appear to have fewer membrane
stabilizing properties.

there is ample

evidence
that, besides /3-adrenoceptor occupation,
lipophilic padrenoceptor
ligands
exert a, usually
undesired,
effect on the cell
membrane,
the so-called
membrane
stabilizing
activity (msa) or local anaesthetic
activity. as several cell types may be involved, many expressions of
these effects,
unrelated
to /3-adrenoceptor
occupation, have been described in various in vivo and
in vitro pharmacological
assays.
thus, hellenbrecht
et al. [l] demonstrated
that
local anaesthetic
activity (isolated frog nerve) and
myocardial
conduction
velocity (frog heart) were
markedly influenced by nine padrenoceptor
ligands,
which effects were linearly correlated with the lipophilicities of the derivatives.
similar conclusions,
to
mention only a few recent findings, were drawn with
respect to the immobilization
of human sperm [2],

the cornea1 penetration in the rabbit eye [3], the
inhibition of [3h]noradrenaline uptake in rat brain
synaptosomes [4], and the effects on maximum
upstroke velocity of the action potential in guinea-pig
papillary muscles [5]. furthermore, in radioligand
binding studies, the influence on non-specific binding
of radiolabeled badrenoceptor
antagonists, such as
[3h]dihydroalprenolol,
is dependent on the lipophilicity of the displacing agent [6], at least in tissue
preparations with high non-specific binding.
characteristically, the potencies of the padrenoceptor ligands with regard to these effects usually are
more than three decades lower than their respective
affinities towards the padrenoceptor.
moreover, no

stereospecificity is observed, the i- and d-stereoisomers
of propranolol,
for instance,
being
equiactive.
the molecular pharmacological basis for this membrane stabilizing activity has been and still is a matter
of debate. it has been suggested that padrenoceptor
ligands interact with membrane phospholipids, such
as phosphatidylcholine
[7,8]. on the other hand, as
local anaesthetic activity is often explained in terms
of blockade of the voltage-dependent
sodium channels (in neurons), it is conceivable that padrenoceptor ligands are capable of interacting with this
channel, resulting in “membrane stabilization”.
recently, it was established that the binding of a
radiolabeled neurotoxin derivative, [3h]batrachotoxinin a 20-a-benzoate
([3h] xxxd360xxx ), to (a site
of) the voltage-sensitive sodium channel in rat or
guinea-pig brain preparations is inhibited by compounds with local anaesthetic
activities [ xxxd2274xxx ],
including some &adrenoceptor agents.
previously, we quantitatively
documented
the
interaction of /3-adrenoceptor ligands with both bland &adrenoceptors
by radioligand binding studies
[12,13]. in the present paper we evaluate, again in
a quantitative fashion, the binding of 12 phenoxypropanolamines
to the voltage-dependent
sodium
channel, as measured by their displacement of the
specific [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding to a rat brain synaptosomal preparation. physicochemical properties of
the compounds are taken into account and are
related to the biological effects, in order to derive
clues that provide a molecular basis for the membrane stabilizing activity of p-adrenoceptor ligands.

materials and

methods

preparation of synaptosomes. synaptosomes were
prepared from rat brain by a modification of the
method of gray and whittaker (141, as described by
postma and catterall [9]. briefly, the brains of male
wistar rats (200-25og, cpb, tno, zeist, the
netherlands) were removed, homogenized in icecold 0.32 m sucrose (ph 7.4) and centrifuged at
1000 g for 10 min. the supernatant was centrifuged
at 17,000g for 45 min. the resuspended pellet
(0.32 m sucrose/5 mm k2hp04/kh2p04
ph 7.4)
was layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient,
and centrifuged at 100,ooog for 105 min. synaptosomes were collected from the 1.0-1.2 m sucrose
interface, resuspended (final sucrose concentration
0.32 m), and centrifuged at 40,000 g for 45 min. the
final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer consisting of 5.4 mm kcl, 0.8 mm mgs04, 5.5 mm glucose, 130 mm choline chloride, and 50 mm hepestris (ph7.4).
aliquots were frozen on dry ice,
and subsequently stored in liquid nitrogen. binding
characteristics remained constant for more than
three months.
[3h] xxxd360xxx  binding assay. all assays were performed in duplicate in a final volume of 250 1-11
containing the following components in a hepes buffer
(50 mm hepes, adjusted to ph 7.4 with  xxxd3449xxx ):
(a) loo@ of various concentrations
of badrenoceptor ligands, or 100 ~1 veratridine
(final concentration 500 ,um to obtain nonspecific binding), or
100 ~1 buffer;
(b) 50 ~1 [3h] xxxd360xxx  (2-3 nm);
uin(c) 50 ~1 of a crude scorpion toxin leiurus
questriatus solution (final concentration 200 pg 3ml);
(d) 50 ~1 of a synaptosomal suspension in hepes
buffer (2 mg/ml) .
incubations were carried out for 30 min at 37”, and
were terminated by the addition of 2 ml ice-cold
hepes buffer to the incubation tubes. the synaptosomes were immediately collected on glass-fiber
filters (whatman gf/c) under vacuum and washed
three times with 2 ml hepes buffer. radioactivity
retained at the filters was counted, following drying
of the filters at 70” for 45 min, in 4 ml optiphase mp
counting liquid at 55% efficiency on a lkb 1214
rackbeta liquid scintillation spectrometer. specific
binding was defined as the difference between radioactivity bound in the absence and presence of 500 pm
veratridine or 200 pm aconitine, which yielded identical results.
protein determination. protein was determined by
the method of lowry et al. using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard [15].

data analysis following the law of mass-action has
previously been described [ 161.
ki and kn values are given with approximated se.

of the aromatic moiety of the ligands (i.e. the corresponding, substituted benzenes) were calculated,

results

in fig. 1 the behaviour of three @adrenoceptor
ligands with respect to the displacement of specific
[3h] xxxd360xxx  binding is shown.  xxxd2869xxx  displays
the highest affinity (in the low micromolar range),
whereas  xxxd2991xxx  is not very effective in displacing
[3h] xxxd360xxx  from its binding sites in our rat brain
synaptosomal preparation. all three drugs do not
influence non-specific [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding. as documented in a previous paper [19], [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding
in this synaptosomal preparation is effectively displaced by batrachotoxin and veratridine (results not
shown). ki values are similar to those obtained by
others [20], and the binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  is characterized by relatively hi h affinity and capacity (kd
- 90 nm, b,, - 5 pmol pmg protein). in table 1 the
displacement characteristics of the mentioned and
nine other fiadrenoceptor blocking agents are represented by their ki and pkr values, respectively,

together with their structural formulas. from computer-assisted data analysis it was revealed that the
interaction between the b-adrenoceptor ligands and
the t3h] xxxd360xxx  binding site is best described by the
assumption of one single binding site. this is in
agreement with the finding that all displacement
curves have slope factors (“pseudo” hill coefficients)
which do not differ significantly from unity (results
not shown).
from table 1 it is obvious that all ligands are
capable of displacing specific [3h]btx-13 binding,
but with potencies that vary considerably. in an
attempt to explain this diversity in affinities, we
have focused on the structural and physi~ochemical
characteristics of the derivatives. all ligands are
phenoxypropanolamines,
having an identical aliphatic side chain (one exception:  xxxd2869xxx  has
a tert-butylamino
function, the others are isopropylamino derivatives) the pi(, values of the
phenoxypropanolamines
range from 9.2 to 9.5 [21],

the amounts of cations approximating 100% at ph
7.4. on the assumptions that the cations are the
active ionic species interacting with the sodium channel, and that l- and d-stereoisomers are equipotent
[lo], no further corrections with respect to & values
were made. thus, in this case, total drug concentrations refer to active drug concentrations, and
variation in biological effect should be ascribed
almost exclusively to variation in substitution patterns of the aromatic nucleus within this class of /iadrenoceptor ligands. therefore, we have calculated
some physicochemical
parameters of substituted
benzenes, corresponding to the aromatic moieties of
the phenoxyprop~olamines.
in table 2 the calculated lipophilicities of the substituted benzenes,
and the calculated steric parameters for the various
substituents are delineated. lipophilicities are the
log p values (octanol/water),
calculated according
to the hydrophobic fragmental system [17]. in a
previous report we have shown that experimentally

determined log p values (as far as known) closely
match the calculated log p values for these substituted benzenes [12]. steric influences are quantified by the so-called steric branching parameter (sb),
which largely accounts for branching of a substituent
rather than for “width” or “length” [18].
first, we have considered the correlation between
the pki values of the compounds and their respective
lipophilicities. for all twelve ligands the following
equation was derived by (multiple) regression
analysis
pki = 0.95(*0.12)
n = 12

r = 0.9332

log pcalc + 1.89 (20.31)
s = 0.4488

(i)

f = 67.403
equation (1) is graphically represented in fig. 2.
the omission of  xxxd2869xxx , being the only ntert.butyl substituted derivative, did not significantly
influence the equation
pki = 0.94(*0.14)
n = 11

r = 0.9128

log pcalc + l.gl(ko.35)
s = 0.4719

(2)

f = 44.938
although the contribution of lipophilicity to binding
explains more than 80-85% of the observed variance
(s), a further improvement of the equations could
be achieved by the introduction of sbr,, the steric
branching parameter for the substituents paru to the
aliphatic side chain. the result is shown for all twelve
ligands
pki = 0.71(&0.12) log pcalc- 0.24(*0.08)sbr,
+ 2.77( t0.37)
n = 12

r = 0.9647

(3)
s = 0.3465

use of both steric parameters in regression analysis
clearly demonstrates that only the contribution of
sbr, is significant (results not shown).
neither the inclusion of sbr, (me@) and (log p)2,
nor the use of other parameters such as hammett’s
a(electronicity) improve the quality of the regression
equations.
discussion
the inhibition of [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding by local
anaesthetics has been documented as an indirect
allosteric mechanism [9]. although, as in the present
study (see fig. 1 and table l), displacement studies
in equilibrium su gest a merely competitive interaction between [$h] xxxd360xxx  and compounds with
local anaesthetic properties, the rate of [3h] xxxd360xxx 
dissociation was shown to be increased in the presence of these derivatives, altogether indicative for an
indirect allosteric mechanism. thus, there appears to
be a local anaesthetic (la) receptor distinct from
the [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding site. in the discussion we
will further refer to this putative complex of proteins
as the [3h] xxxd360xxx /la binding site, as present on
the voltage-sensitive
sodium channel. from the
established regression equations the major conclusions to be drawn are:
(1) lipophilicity is the predominant factor that determines the affinity of the phenoxypropanolamines
for the [3h] xxxd360xxx /la binding site on the voltagesensitive sodium channel;
(2) the substituent paru to the aliphatic side chain,
exerts two effects on the affinity: it influences lipophilicity (as do all substituents),
and, second, by
steric hindrance, it negatively influences sodium
channel affinity

as mentioned in the introduction, lipophilicity has
been found to be of prime importance in all studies
although the inclusion of sbr, (&ho) instead of dealing with membrane stabilization by p-adrenosba, also yields an improved equation, the combined
ceptor ligands. to our knowledge this is the first
report to interpret and evaluate this phenomenon
quantitatively by radioligand binding studies on the
sodium channel. in table 3 we have ranked the
relative potencies of a number of padrenoceptor
antagonists in various functional pharmacological
tests, and compared these with the relative affinities
for the rh] xxxd360xxx /la
binding site. although it
can be concluded from the respective correlation
coefficients that a fair parallellism between sodium
channel binding and functional parameters exists,
two remarks have to be made. first, in functional
studies it is likely that the transport of the active
substance from the organ bath into the tissue, a
phenomenon which is governed by lipophilicity as
well, is an important factor. second, a good corlrelation per se does not necessarily mean that all non
specific functional effects of /l-blockers are indeed
mediated through an interaction with the voltagei

this organ preparation more quickly than observed
for compounds unsubstituted in this direction [5].
furthermore, these authors did not establish marked
differences between the n-tert. butyl and n-isopropyl substituted phenoxypropanolamines,
which
places reliance on the inclusion of  xxxd2869xxx  (ntert. butyl substituted) in the regression equations.
how do these results compare with padrenoceptor affinity? in a previous study [13] we have
presented regression equations for the jli- and aadrenoceptor
affinities of a similar class of 14
phenoxypropanolamines,
derived in an analogous
way. for reasons of comparison, the best equations
for &-, &adrenoceptor,
and sodium channel affinity
are represented together in table 4 (without the
standard errors of the regression coefficients and the
statistic parameters).
obviously, the lipophilic environments
of the
binding sites, whether on the padrenoceptor
or on
the sodium channel, do not differ markedly. for the
/3-adrenoceptor it has been suggested that tryptophan
moieties on the macromolecule are responsible for
the lipophilic interaction [22], which idea could be
of relevance for the definition of the rh] xxxd360xxx /la
binding site on the sodium channel.
the steric aspects of the respective binding sites
are clearly different. all three substituent positions
determine
@-adrenoceptor affinity, whereas the
sodium channel is only sensitive to substitution paru
to the aliphatic side chain. thus, the introduction
of
a bulky para substituent

together
with a less prominent
local
activity. therapeutically,
this particular
of effects is usually strongly favoured

a third point of discussion are the values of the
intercepts in the three regression equations: cu. 6.0
for both fiadrenoceptors,
in contrast with a value of
2.8 for the sodium channel. obviously, the oxypropanolamine
side chain is far better accommodated for by the padrenoceptor
binding sites than
by the active site on the sodium channel. [3h]btxb, due to the presence of a tertiary amino group
in the molecule, is positively charged (monovalent
cation) at ph7.4, as are the oxypropanolamines.
thus, the charged amino function in the padrenoceptor ligands per se seems mandatory for affinity
at the [3h] xxxd360xxx /la binding site. among other
explanations, it can therefore be reasoned that the
distance between the lipophilic moiety and the
charged amino function is not fully adequate for
optimal affinity towards the sodium channel.
the above speculations are strongly stressed by
the findings of mcneal et al. [lo] with respect to the
“classical” local anaesthetics.  xxxd305xxx , lacking an
amino function protonated at physiological ph, has
virtually no effect in the [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding assay,
whereas the lipophilic local anaesthetics with secondary or tertiary amino functions, like  xxxd2280xxx  and
 xxxd1869xxx , respectively, display affinities comparable
to  xxxd2869xxx  in the present study. local anaesthetics
bearing a quatemary ammonium group (the methiodides) tend to be less active than the corresponding
tertiary analogues, although no regular pattern is
observed. hence, it can be speculated that the
charged amino function should preferably be a protonated one. interestingly,
besides the padrenoceptor antagonists and the local anaesthetics, a great
variety of other classes of drugs inhibit [3h]btxb binding, including calcium antagonists, tricyclic
antidepressants
and tranquillizers, such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones.
all active substances
share a lipophilic region and a (charged) amino
function.

from these considerations it would be interesting
to further explore the nature of the lipophilic region
and the distance between this region and the charged
amino function. a starting point could be  xxxd2956xxx 
(a d2 dopamine antagonist) which was shown to be
very effective in displacement studies with [3h]btxb [ 111. its iq, value of 50 nm is even lower than the
& value of [3h] xxxd360xxx  itself (- 90 nm). the log p
value of  xxxd2956xxx  is 5.56, and from its pka value it
can be derived that more than 90% of this compound
is protonated at physiological ph.
a final point to discuss is the phenomenon
of
non-specific binding in radioligand binding studies
performed with labeled lipophilic &adrenoceptor
ligands, like [3h]dihydroalprenolol.
the high extent
of non-specific binding with this radioligand observed
in membrane
preparations
of skeletal muscles
[24,25] could be overcome by the inclusion of  xxxd2914xxx  (10d4 m) in the incubation medium [26].
since skeletal muscles are richly endowed with the
voltage-sensitive sodium channel [27], and as  xxxd2914xxx  is a rather effective displacer of rh]btxb with an 1~50value of 8.4,um, it can be imagined
that non-specific binding of [3h]dihydroalprenolo1
has to be interpreted, at least in this case, in terms
of sodium channel binding. of course, the high
amount of non-specific binding that can be displaced
non stereospecifically, observed with [3h]dihydroalprenolol in cell types (whether membrane preparations or intact cells) without a significant population of voltage-sensitive
sodium channels will
demand another explanation [6,28].
in conclusion, it is suggested that the molecular
basis of the so-called membrane stabilizing or local
anaesthetic properties of /3-adrenoceptor ligands is
found in their interaction with the voltage-sensitive
sodium channel. this interaction is dependent on
lipophilic and steric parameters of the ligands, which
can be used to separate badrenoceptor affinity from
membrane stabilizing activity.
