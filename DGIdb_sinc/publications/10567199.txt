natriuretic response to increased pressure is preserved
with cox-2 inhibitors

abstract—elevation of renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (rihp) by direct renal interstitial volume expansion increases
sodium excretion. this natriuretic response is blunted by the nonspecific inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (cox)
enzymes. the present study tested the hypothesis that the natriuretic response to increased rihp during direct renal
interstitial volume expansion is dependent on cox-1 but not cox-2. rihp and fractional excretion of sodium (fena)
were measured before and after direct renal interstitial volume expansion in control rats (n57), rats infused with the
cox-1 inhibitor  xxxd2969xxx  (n56, 1.5 mg/kg), and rats infused with the cox-2 inhibitors ns-398 (n55, 1.5 mg/kg) and
 xxxd2561xxx  (n56, 0.3 mg/kg). in control animals, direct renal interstitial volume expansion significantly increased rihp
(d2.360.5 mm hg, p,0.05) and fena (d1.160.3%, p,0.05). likewise, in animals infused with ns-398 or  xxxd2561xxx ,
direct renal interstitial volume expansion significantly increased rihp (d1.860.6 mm hg, p,0.05, and
d1.760.3 mm hg, p,0.05) and fena (d1.560.4%, p,0.05, and d1.160.3%, p,0.05), respectively. in contrast,
infusion of  xxxd2969xxx  significantly blunted the natriuretic response to direct renal interstitial volume expansion (dfena
0.360.2%), even though rihp was increased (d1.960.6 mm hg, p,0.05). infusion of  xxxd2969xxx  but not ns-398 or
 xxxd2561xxx  blunted the natriuretic response to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that the
natriuretic response to increased blood pressure may be preserved during inhibition of cox-2. (hypertension.

ncreases in arterial blood pressure are associated with
elevations in renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (rihp)
and fractional sodium excretion (fena).1,2 when the renal
capsule is removed, renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure is
prevented from rising and the natriuretic response to increased blood pressure is blunted, which suggests that rihp
is an important factor linking arterial blood pressure to
tubular reabsorption of sodium.3,4
the elevation in renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure in
response to increased renal perfusion pressure is mimicked by
direct renal interstitial volume expansion (drive), the technique used in the present study. drive was previously
shown to significantly increase renal interstitial hydrostatic
pressure and sodium excretion without affecting renal blood
flow or glomerular filtration rate (gfr).5 the natriuretic
response to increased renal perfusion pressure or direct renal
interstitial volume expansion is blunted during inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis by the nonspecific cyclooxygenase
inhibitors indomethacin or meclofenamate,6 – 8 demonstrating
that the presence of prostaglandins are required for the full
expression of the natriuretic response to increased renal
interstitial hydrostatic pressure.

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) inhibit
the activity of cyclooxygenase (cox), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of  xxxd208xxx  to prostanoids. two
separate isoforms of this enzyme have been identified,
cox-1 and cox-2.9 –11 because inflammatory mediators and
growth factors induce cox-2 expression but not cox-1
expression, cox-2 has been generally described as the more
important cox isoform in mediating inflammation, whereas
cox-1 is thought to be involved with the physiological
homeostasis regulation of renal, gastrointestinal, and platelet
functions.11 however, recent studies have demonstrated constitutive cox-2 expression in the kidney and its dependence
on volume status.12–14 thus the role of cox-2–synthesized
prostaglandins in the kidney is not clear.
ns-398 and  xxxd2561xxx  are nsaids that have been shown
to have potent anti-inflammatory activity in the rat.15,16
ns-398 has been demonstrated to selectively inhibit cox-2
without affecting cox-1 activity.15,17 likewise,  xxxd2561xxx 
has consistently demonstrated a preference to inhibit cox-2
with a cox-2/cox-1 ic50 ratio of 0.33.18 conversely,
 xxxd2969xxx  is a nsaid that has demonstrated a preference to
inhibit cox-1 (ic50 ratio of 250).19 traditional nsaids such

as indomethacin are nonselective cox inhibitors (ic50 ratio
of 60).19
the present study compared the effects of therapeutically
similar anti-inflammatory doses of  xxxd2969xxx , ns-398, or
 xxxd2561xxx  on the natriuretic response to increased renal
interstitial hydrostatic pressure. we hypothesized that  xxxd2969xxx  infusion would blunt the natriuretic response to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure induced by
drive, whereas ns-398 and  xxxd2561xxx  infusion would
have no effect on the natriuretic response.

methods
at least 2 weeks before the acute experiment, polyethylene matrixes
were implanted in the left kidney of 250-g male sprague-dawley rats
as previously described.5 briefly, the rats were anesthetized with an
intramuscular injection of equal volumes of xylazine (lloyd laboratories) and ketalar (parke-davis) (100 mg/kg body wt). under
aseptic conditions, the rats were placed on a heated table and a
midline abdominal incision was made. the left kidney was exposed
and 2 polyethylene matrixes were implanted in each renal pole. the
muscle layer was closed with a continuous 3-0 vicryl suture, and the
skin layer was closed with separate silk 4-0 sutures.
on the day of the acute experiment, rats with implanted matrixes
were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg body
wt) of inactin (byk-gulden) and were placed on a heated table to
maintain rectal temperature at '37°c. after tracheostomy, a polyethylene (pe-50) catheter was inserted in the jugular veins for
infusions and in the carotid artery for arterial blood sampling and the
monitoring of mean arterial pressure (map). intravenous infusions
of 0.9% nacl and 2% inulin in 6 mmol/l licl dissolved in 0.9%
nacl were initiated each at 1 ml/100 g body wt per hour, and a
2-hour recovery period was allowed. then, the implanted matrixes
were exposed; one was connected to a pressure transducer to
continuously monitor renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure and the
other matrix was used for drive. a pe-50 catheter was placed in
the ureter for urine collection. in the vehicle,  xxxd2969xxx , and
 xxxd2561xxx  protocols (groups 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8), urine samples were
collected on ice and frozen at 230°c for later determination of
prostaglandin (pge)2. in all protocols, a blood sample was collected
at the midpoint of the clearance. all experiments were performed
within the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use
committee of mayo foundation.
 xxxd2969xxx  was purchased from sigma. ns-398 was purchased
from cayman chemical.  xxxd2561xxx  was generously donated by
boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals, inc.

group 1: effect of drive on fena(n57)
two hours after the infusions had been started, a 30-minute control
clearance was taken. then, volume expansion of the renal interstitium was achieved by injecting 100 ml of an artificial lymph
solution (2.5% albumin in 0.9% nacl) into the remaining chronically
implanted matrix. after a stabilization period of at least 10 minutes,
a final 30-minute experimental clearance was started.

group 2: effect of drive on fena during cox-1
inhibition by  xxxd2969xxx  (n56)
ninety minutes after the infusions had been started, the cox-1
inhibitor  xxxd2969xxx  (1.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously as a
bolus. a similar dose of  xxxd2969xxx  (daily oral dose range from '0.50
to 0.95 mg/kg, id50 0.67 mg/kg) was previously shown to dosedependently inhibit paw swelling in the rat in a model of adjuvantinduced arthritis.16 after a 30-minute equilibration period, a 30minute control clearance was taken. then, 100 ml of a 2.5% albumin
solution was infused into the remaining chronically implanted
matrix. after a stabilization period of at least 10 minutes, a final
30-minute experimental clearance was started.

group 3: effect of drive on fena during cox-2
inhibition by ns-398 (n55)
this protocol is identical to group 2 except that the cox-2 inhibitor
ns-398 (1.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously as a bolus 90
minutes after the infusions had been started. this dose of ns-398
was previously shown to completely inhibit cox-2 activity in an in
vivo inflammation model without affecting cox-1 activity.15

group 4: effect of drive on fena during cox-2
inhibition by  xxxd2561xxx  (n56).
this protocol is identical to group 2 except that the cox-2 inhibitor
 xxxd2561xxx  (0.3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously as a bolus 90
minutes after the infusions had been started. a similar dose of
 xxxd2561xxx  (daily oral dose range from '0.10 to 0.14 mg/kg, id50
0.12 mg/kg) was previously shown to dose-dependently inhibit paw
swelling in the rat in a model of adjuvant-induced arthritis.16

group 5: saline time control (n54)
this protocol is a time control for group 1. two hours after initiation
of intravenous infusions, a 30-minute clearance was taken. then, a
final 30-minute clearance was taken.

group 6:  xxxd2969xxx  time control (n56)
this protocol is a time control for group 2. ninety minutes after
initiation of the intravenous infusions, the cox-1 inhibitor  xxxd2969xxx  (1.5 mg/kg bolus) was administered intravenously. after a
30-minute equilibration period, a 30-minute control clearance was
taken. then, a final 30-minute clearance was taken.

group 7: ns-398 time control (n55)
this protocol is a time control for group 4. ninety minutes after
initiation of the intravenous infusions, the cox-2 inhibitor ns-398
(1.5 mg/kg bolus) was administered intravenously. after a 30-minute
equilibration period, a 30-minute control clearance was taken. then,
a final 30-minute clearance was collected.

group 8:  xxxd2561xxx  time control (n57)
this protocol is a time control for group 3. ninety minutes after
initiation of the intravenous infusions, the cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd2561xxx  (0.3 mg/kg bolus) was administered intravenously. after a
30-minute equilibration period, a 30-minute control clearance was
taken. then, a final 30-minute clearance was collected.

analytic procedures
gfr was determined from the clearance of inulin. inulin concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by the anthrone method.20
sodium and lithium concentrations in plasma and urine were
measured by flame photometry (instrumentation laboratory inc).
urinary pge2 concentrations were determined by a  xxxd1903xxx 
immunoassay kit (cayman chemical).
results are expressed as mean6sem. significance of changes
within groups was evaluated with a paired t test, and an unpaired t
test was used for statistical comparisons between groups. statistical
significance was defined as p,0.05.

results
the renal responses to drive in the presence and absence of
 xxxd2969xxx , ns-398, or  xxxd2561xxx  are shown in table 1.
volume expansion of the renal interstitium by injection of
100 ml of a 2.5% albumin solution into the chronically
implanted matrix significantly increased renal interstitial
hydrostatic pressure from 4.461.0 to 6.861.3 mm hg (d
2.360.5 mm hg, p,0.05) in vehicle-infused rats, 4.560.8 to

rihp was stable in the vehicle time control group
(7.161.4 to 6.661.4 mm hg, d20.560.4 mm hg) and in the
ns-398 –infused time control rats (6.360.5 to
6.160.7 mm hg, d20.260.3 mm hg). rihp was measured
in 6  xxxd2561xxx -infused time control rats (5.160.8 to
5.460.7 mm hg, d0.360.2 mm hg) and 3  xxxd2969xxx -infused
time control rats (data: 8.1 to 6.8 mm hg, 7.3 to 5.1 mm hg,
and 4.7 to 5.0 mm hg), and no significant changes in rihp
were observed. in the vehicle time controls and piroxicaminfused time control rats, no significant changes in fena, feli,
or uv were observed (table 2). however, in ns-398 –
infused time control rats, fena and feli significantly increased, whereas uv remained stable. similarly, in the
 xxxd2561xxx -infused time control rats, fena significantly increased whereas feli and uv remained stable. in all time
control rats, map and gfr remained stable.
pge2 excretion is presented as the combined data of each
experimental group and its respective time control during the

6.061.1 mm hg (d1.760.3 mm hg, p,0.05) in meloxicaminfused rats. the increase in rihp was similar between these
4 groups. these increases in rihp were associated with
significant increases in fena and urinary flow rate (uv) in the
vehicle, ns-398 –infused, and  xxxd2561xxx -infused rats. in
contrast, the natriuretic response to drive during  xxxd2969xxx 
infusion was significantly blunted. the increase in fena after
drive was significantly greater in the vehicle-infused rats
(d1.160.3%), the ns-398 –infused rats (d1.560.4%), and
the  xxxd2561xxx -infused rats (d1.160.3%) as compared with
the  xxxd2969xxx -infused rats (d0.360.2%, p,0.05). fractional
lithium excretion (feli) tended to increase in the vehicletreated rats after drive, although this increase did not reach
statistical significance (p50.07). feli significantly increased
in ns-398 –infused and  xxxd2561xxx -infused rats in response
to drive. in the  xxxd2969xxx -infused animals, uv and feli
did not increase in response to drive. gfr and map
remained unaltered in all groups before and after drive.

first clearance period (ie, the pge2 excretions of groups 1 and
5, groups 2 and 6, and groups 4 and 8 were combined).
intravenous infusion of  xxxd2969xxx  significantly reduced urinary pge2 excretion (762 pg/min) as compared with control
rats (5068 pg/min, p,0.05) and as compared with rats
infused with  xxxd2561xxx  (3668 pg/min, p,0.05). pge2

discussion
the present study demonstrates that the natriuretic response
to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure induced by
direct renal interstitial volume expansion is preserved in the
presence of the cox-2 inhibitors ns-398 and  xxxd2561xxx . in
contrast, infusion of the cox-1 inhibitor  xxxd2969xxx  significantly blunted the natriuretic response to increased renal
interstitial hydrostatic pressure. these studies suggest that the
presence of cox-1 and not cox-2 is required for the full
expression of the natriuretic response to increased renal
interstitial hydrostatic pressure during direct renal interstitial
volume expansion.
prostaglandins have long been recognized as playing a role
in the regulation of sodium balance during elevations in renal
perfusion pressure and renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure.
carmines et al6 demonstrated in the dog that elevations in
renal perfusion pressure were associated with enhanced
sodium excretion. after indomethacin administration, there
was a marked attenuation of the effect of increased renal
perfusion pressure on sodium excretion. the natriuretic
response to increased renal perfusion pressure was attenuated
in rats given meclofenamate as compared with control animals.21 likewise, the natriuretic response to increased renal
interstitial hydrostatic pressure induced by drive is blunted
during nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin or meclofenamate.7,8 similarly, in the present study, the
natriuretic response to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic
pressure induced by drive was significantly blunted during
infusion of  xxxd2969xxx , a cox-1 inhibitor, even though rihp
was significantly increased.
sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule decreases after
increases in renal perfusion pressure.22,23 increases in renal
interstitial hydrostatic pressure induced by direct renal interstitial volume expansion inhibits proximal tubular sodium
reabsorption, and this inhibition of sodium reabsorption is
abolished by pretreatment with indomethacin or meclofenamate.24 consistent with these observations, in the present
study, fractional excretion of lithium, a marker for proximal
tubular sodium reabsorption, significantly increased after
drive in rats infused with the cox-2 inhibitors ns-398 and
 xxxd2561xxx . on the other hand, infusion of  xxxd2969xxx  blocked
the increase in feli after drive. taken together, these
results suggest that the increase in lithium excretion after
renal interstitial volume expansion reflects decreased proximal tubular sodium reabsorption and is mediated by cox1–synthesized renal prostaglandins.
urinary pge2 was markedly decreased in rats infused with
 xxxd2969xxx . in contrast, pge2 excretion was not significantly
inhibited in rats infused with  xxxd2561xxx , which is in agreement with a previous study performed in humans.25 in a study

by gonzalez-campoy et al,26 inhibition of prostaglandin
synthesis by indomethacin blunted the pressure natriuretic
response to increased perfusion pressure in the dog. subsequent infusion of pge2 into the renal artery of the indomethacin-treated dogs completely restored the natriuretic effect of
increased perfusion pressure. because a fixed level of intrarenal pge2 was administered, it was concluded that the
presence of pge2 was necessary for full expression of the
natriuretic response to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic
pressure during increased renal perfusion pressure. likewise,
in the present study the presence of prostaglandins in the
control rats, the ns-398 –infused rats, and  xxxd2561xxx -infused
rats was sufficient to allow for the full expression of the
natriuretic response to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic
pressure induced by drive. in contrast,  xxxd2969xxx  infusion
resulted in markedly reduced prostaglandin excretions and a
blunted natriuretic response to increased rihp as compared
with control and  xxxd2561xxx -infused rats.
although nsaids are therapeutically effective for the
conditions for which they are prescribed, adverse renal effects
such as sodium retention, edema, and decreases in renal blood
flow and gfr have been attributed to nsaids.27 moreover,
the use of nsaids increases the risk for initiation of
antihypertensive therapy.28 it has been suggested that the
selective inhibition of cox-2 would offer the antiinflammatory therapeutic benefits associated with the use of
nsaids and would avoid the renal sodium retention associated with these drugs.29 although the present study did not
independently show that ns-398 and  xxxd2561xxx  inhibited
cox-2 in the kidney, these studies suggest that the inhibition
of the cox-2 enzyme may preserve the pressure natriuretic
response to increased blood pressure while offering antiinflammatory relief because the natriuretic response to
drive was preserved in the presence of 2 separate cox-2
inhibitors at doses that have been shown to inhibit inflammation in vivo.15,16
infusion of ns-398 and  xxxd2561xxx  significantly increased
fena in the absence of drive. it is important to note that
constitutive renal cox-2 expression in the rat appears to be
highly localized to the macula densa, whereas cox-1 expression is more widely distributed.12,13 the increase in sodium
excretion after cox-2 inhibition in the present time-control
studies might be related to decreased renin activity, because
the elevation in plasma renin activity in response to salt
restriction has been reported to be blocked by a cox-2
inhibitor.30
in conclusion,  xxxd2969xxx  but not ns-398 or  xxxd2561xxx 
blunts the natriuretic response to increased renal interstitial
hydrostatic pressure during direct renal interstitial volume
expansion. these observations suggest that the natriuretic
response to increased renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure
may be preserved during inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx .
