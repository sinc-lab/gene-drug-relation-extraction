hemodynamic and biochemical effects of the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan in hypertension.  we studied the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and biochemical effects of the novel angiotensin type 1 (at1) receptor antagonist irbesartan in 86 untreated patients with essential hypertension on a normal sodium diet. according to a double-blind parallel group trial, patients were randomized to a once-daily oral dose of the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist (1, 25, or 100 mg) or placebo after a placebo run-in period of 3 weeks. randomization medication was given for 1 week. compared with placebo, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure did not change with the 1-mg dose, and it fell (mean and 95% confidence interval) by 7.0 (4.2-9.8)/6.1 (3.9-8.1) mm hg with the 25-mg dose and by 12.1 (8.1-16.2)/7.2 (4.9-9.4) mm hg with the 100-mg dose. heart rate did not change during either dose. with the 25-mg dose, the antihypertensive effect was attenuated during the second half of the recording, and with the 100-mg dose, it was maintained for 24 hours. baseline values of renin and the antihypertensive response to the 25- and 100-mg doses were well correlated (r = .68, p < .01). renin did not change with the 1-mg dose, but it rose threefold to fourfold with the 25-mg dose and fourfold to fivefold with the 100-mg dose 4 to 6 hours after administration. with the 100-mg dose, renin was still elevated twofold 24 hours after dosing. the changes in renin induced by the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist were associated with parallel increments in  xxxg99xxx  and  xxxg99xxx . aldosterone, despite  xxxg100xxx  blockade, did not fall.(abstract truncated at 250 words).
