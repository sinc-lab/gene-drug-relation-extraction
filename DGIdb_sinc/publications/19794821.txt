anastrozole use in early stage breast cancer of post-menopausal women.  the majority of breast cancers express the  xxxg730xxx  and depend on estradiol (e2) for their growth. hormonal therapy aims at depriving estrogen signaling either by using selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators (serm)-that interfere with the binding of e2 to its receptor (er)-or aromatase inhibitors (ai)-that block the aromatase-dependent synthesis of e2. while serms are recommended for both pre- and post-menopausal patients, ais are indicated only for post-menopausal patients. for the past 20 years, the serm tamoxifen has been considered the "gold standard" for the treatment of  xxxg1603xxx  positive breast cancers. however, tamoxifen's role is now challenged by third generation ais, such as anastrozole, which exhibit greater efficacy in the adjuvant setting in several recently reported trials. this review will focus on anastrozole's mechanism of action, dosing, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical applications. it will briefly discuss the clinical trials that determined anastrozole's efficacy in the treatment of advanced breast cancer (abc) and in the neoadjuvant setting. finally, it will present the clinical trials that established anastrozole as a frontline agent in the treatment of post-menopausal women with  xxxg1603xxx  positive early breast cancer.
