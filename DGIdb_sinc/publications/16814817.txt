abstract
the novel spiroimidazoline, s18616, a potent and efficacious agonist at a2-adrenoceptors (ars), shows >100-fold selectivity versus a1-ars,
imidazoline receptors and all other sites examined. herein, we characterized its discriminative stimulus (ds) properties in rats trained to recognise
s18616 (0.01 mg/kg, s.c.) from saline. s18616 dose-dependently (0.0063e0.01) and ‘‘fully’’ (80% ‘‘s18616’’ lever selection) substituted for
itself. full substitution was also acquired for the agonist, uk14,304 (0.04e0.16), while the partial agonist, clonidine (0.01e0.08), yielded submaximal substitution (67%). guanfacine (0.16e1.25) and  xxxd2241xxx  (0.00063e0.04), preferential agonists at a2a-ars, revealed full substitution
for s18616. in contrast, the a1-ar agonists,  xxxd1707xxx  and st587 (both 0.04e0.63), did not substitute. the a2-ar antagonists, rx821,002, atipamezole (both 0.0025e0.04) and idazoxan (0.04e0.63) blocked the s18616 ds, whereas the a1-ar antagonists,  xxxd3000xxx  (0.16e0.63) and
wb4101 (0.04e0.63), were inactive.  xxxd3000xxx  is also a preferential antagonist at a2b/2c- versus a2a-ars and a further preferential a2b/2c-ar
antagonist, brl41,992 (0.63e2.5), was likewise ineffective. in contrast, the a2a-ar antagonist, brl44,408 (0.04e0.16), dose-dependently
abolished the s18616 ds. finally, the ‘‘atypical’’ antidepressants, mirtazapine (0.16e10.0) and  xxxd2637xxx  (0.63e10.0), which behave as antagonists
at a2a-ars, dose-dependently blocked the s18616 ds. in conclusion, s18616 elicits a robust ds in rats that principally reflects engagement of
a2a-ars. this novel procedure should prove useful in the characterisation of psychoactive drugs which interact with a2-ars.

1. introduction
drug discrimination procedures have been widely used to
assess the interoceptive properties of a variety of centrallyactive agents such as antidepressants, antipsychotics and analgesics (dekeyne and millan, 2003; dykstra et al., 1997; goudie
et al., 2004). they have also proven useful in the characterisation of drugs that interact with various classes of monoaminergic receptor (dekeyne and millan, 2003; dykstra et al.,

1997; goudie et al., 2004). as concerns multiple subtypes of
a- and b-adrenoceptor (ar), it has been shown that a specific
discriminative stimulus (ds) can be generated in rats by selective agonists at a1-ars (arnt, 1992; schechter, 1991). further,
agonists at b1- and b2-ars elicit robust ds that have been related to the role of b-ars in the control of mood and the aetiology of depressive states (crissman et al., 2001; crissman
and o’donnell, 2002). data are, however, less extensive for
a2-ars of which three functionally-relevant subtypes have
been cloned: a2a (also known as the a2d homologue in
rats), a2b and a2c (hieble et al., 1995; kable et al., 2000;
millan, 2002). successful attempts to produce an interoceptive
cue have been reported with the subtype non-selective

a. dekeyne, m.j. millan / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 718e726

antagonists, yohimbine, ethoxy-idazoxan (rx811,059) and
idazoxan, but the role of a2-ars as compared to imidazoline
and 5-ht1a receptors in their actions has been questioned
(jordan et al., 1996; millan et al., 2000f; sanger, 1989; winter
and rabin, 1993). moreover, curiously few studies have been
devoted to agonists, with the exception of one investigation
of xylazine (colpaert and janssen, 1985), and several reports
on the partial agonist, clonidine (bennett and lal, 1982; cunningham et al., 1985; jordan et al., 1993; lal and yaden, 1985).
in addition, these studies present several important limitations.
first, in the study of the full agonist, xylazine (colpaert and
janssen, 1985), no pharmacological characterisation of its ds
properties was undertaken with other agonists at a2-ars. second, though substitution studies with agonists have been undertaken with a clonidine ds (bennett and lal, 1982; jordan et al.,
1993; lal and yaden, 1985), this ligand is a partial agonist at all
subtypes of a2-ar (buccafusco, 1992; hieble et al., 1995;
millan et al., 2000a,b) complicating interpretation of substitution studies. third, the implication of a2-ar subtypes in the
ds properties of clonidine, xylazine and other a2-ar agonists
has never been examined. fourth, clonidine and xylazine show
only modest selectivity for a2-ars versus a1-ars, and they are
both potent ligands at imidazoline (i1 and i2) receptors which
mediate ds in rodents (jordan et al., 1996; macinnes and
handley, 2003; millan et al., 1994, 2000b). finally, despite
the potential significance of a2-ars in the interoceptive actions
of antidepressants and other classes of psychotropic agent
(invernizzi and garattini, 2004; millan, 2003, 2006; nutt,
1994; nutt and pinder, 1996; svensson, 2003), no ds studies
with a2-ar agonists have, as yet, been undertaken.
recently, we described the pre-clinical profile of a chemically novel and exceptionally potent agonist at all three subtypes of a2-ars, the spiroimidazoline derivative, s18616.
this agent displays striking (>100-fold) selectivity versus
a1- and b-ars, imidazoline (i1 and i2) receptors, and all other
(>50) classes of binding site evaluated (millan et al., 2000b).
reflecting actions at segmental a2-ars involved in the modulation of nociception (hayashi and maze, 1993; millan, 2002),
s18616 displays potent antinociceptive properties in both behavioural and electrophysiological paradigms (millan et al.,
2000b; suzuki et al., 2002). further, in line with its actions
at a2-autoreceptors inhibitory to ‘‘overactive’’ monoaminergic
pathways participating in anxious states (millan, 2003;
schramm et al., 2001), s18616 displayed potent anxiolytic
properties in several rodent procedures (millan et al.,
2000e). these observations suggest the utility of s18616 in
the treatment of anxious and, via systemic or spinal administration, painful states. in addition, s18616 shares the sedative
and hypnotic properties of other a2-ar agonists (millan et al.,
2000e), so it is of potential therapeutic use as an anesthetic
agent, and in the handling of large animals in the veterinarian
domain (cormack et al., 2005; eisenach et al., 1996; hall
et al., 2000; hayashi and maze, 1993; moens et al., 2003).
in light of the above observations, the present study evaluated whether s18616 can elicit a specific and stable ds in rats.
we also characterized the role of a2-ars as compared to
a1-ars and imidazoline sites in the mediation of its potential

ds properties. moreover, we determined whether a2a-, a2band/or a2c-ars are implicated in the interoceptive effects of
s18616. a final aspect of the present work was to examine
whether the antidepressant agents, mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx ,
interfere with the ds properties of s18616. these ‘‘atypical’’
agents, which do not modify serotonin reuptake, possess antagonist properties at a2-ars, blockade of which has been implicated in their beneficial influence upon mood (invernizzi
and garattini, 2004; millan, 2006; nutt and pinder, 1996)
and their preservation of sexual function in depression (benelli
et al., 2004; gelenberg et al., 2000; millan, 2006).
2. material and methods
2.1. animals
male wistar rats (180e200 g body weight upon arrival; iffa-credo, l’arbresle, france) were housed individually in sawdust-lined standard polycarbonate cages with free access to water and, with restricted access to chow
(10e11 g per day) in order to maintain their weight at 80% of free-feeding
values. they were kept under a 12 h/12 h lightedark cycle with lights on at
07:00. laboratory temperature was 21  1.0  c and humidity, 60  5%. all
animal use procedures conformed to international european ethical standards
(86/609-cee) and the french national committee (décret 87/848) for the care
and use of laboratory animals.

2.2. drug discrimination procedure
as described previously (dekeyne et al., 1999; dekeyne and millan,
2003), rats were trained to discriminate s18616 (0.01 mg/kg, s.c.) from saline
in operant conditioning chambers equipped with two levers. they were reinforced with food according to a fixed ratio 10 schedule of reinforcement.
each 15-min daily session (5 days/week) started 15 min after injection. during
‘‘s18616’’ sessions, responses on only one lever were reinforced while, during
‘‘saline’’ sessions, responses on the other lever were reinforced. drug (d) or
saline (s) sessions alternated as follows: dssds-sddss-sdsdd-dsdsd-,
etc. correct responding was defined as no more than 13 presses on both levers
to obtain the first reinforcement. the discrimination criterion was 10 consecutive sessions with correct responding, and animals failing to reach the criterion after 100 sessions were not used further. thereafter, substitution or
antagonism tests were conducted every wednesday and friday, whereas training sessions continued on the other days. rats were tested only if they showed
correct responding on the two preceding training sessions. test drugs were administered instead of s18616, 15 min before the test session (substitution studies), or 30 min prior to the training dose of s18616 (antagonism studies).
substitution/blockade testing was performed at several doses for each
compound. the highest dose tested corresponded to that for which either
‘‘full’’ substitution or blockade (defined as 80% ‘‘s18616’’ or ‘‘saline’’ lever
selection, respectively) was obtained, or a marked decrease in response rates.
test sessions began with individual verification of appropriate lever selection
as a function of the dose of the training drug.

2.3. data analysis
data recorded during a test session were as follows: (1) lever selection,
that is, the lever on which 10 (not necessarily consecutive) presses were recorded first and (2) response rates that is the total number of presses on
both levers. lever selection data were expressed as the percentage of rats selecting the drug lever and were compared by fisher exact probability tests to
control values (0% in substitution studies, 100% in antagonist studies). inhibitory dose50s (id50s) plus 95% confidence limits (95% cl) were calculated to
estimate drug potency in antagonism studies. response rates in the presence of
drug were compared by paired t-tests to response rates obtained during the preceding ‘‘saline’’ (or ‘‘s18616’’ in antagonist studies) training sessions.

3. results
3.1. acquisition of the s18616-mediated discriminative
stimulus (fig. 1)
at the training dose of 0.01 mg/kg, s.c., s18616 reliably and
rapidly yielded a robust ds. the mean (sem) number of training sessions needed to attain the discrimination criterion (10
consecutive sessions with correct responding) was 49  9 (n ¼ 17).
in the course of training sessions, throughout the study, a
reduction in response rates of w40% was seen upon injection
of s18616 as compared to the preceding vehicle session.
3.2. substitution patterns with s18616 and other a2-ar
agonists (fig. 2 and table 1)
upon administration of s18616 itself as the ‘‘test’’ drug, it
produced dose-dependent substitution: the ‘‘s18616’’ lever

and injected by the s.c. route. all the tested drugs are well known to be devoid
of cutaneous toxicity so they were also administered s.c. they were dissolved
in sterile water: if necessary, a few drops of lactic acid were added and the ph
was adjusted to as close to neutrality as possible (5.0). drug sources, salts
and structures were as follows.  xxxd1707xxx  hcl was obtained from synthélabo

the selective a1-ar agonist, st587, did not significantly
substitute for s18616 despite the fact that it dose-dependently
decreased response rates, with statistical significance observed
at the two highest doses tested (0.16 and 0.63 mg/kg). likewise,
another a1-ar agonist,  xxxd1707xxx , failed to substitute for
s18616. at a dose of 0.63 mg/kg, it only slightly decreased
response rates but a further increase in the dose to 2.5 mg/kg
was associated with a complete lack of response in two of four
rats treated so this dose was discontinued (data not shown).

similarly, complete blockade was acquired with the prototypical a2-ar antagonist, idazoxan, which exerted full antagonism at the dose of 0.63. for both rx821,002 and idazoxan,
though not for atipamezole, there was a dose-dependent increase in response rates relative to those for s18616 alone.
this elevation reflects a reversal of the inhibitory influence
of s18616 upon response rates, though there was an ‘‘overshoot’’ at the highest doses of antagonist tested.
3.5. blockade of the ds properties of s18616 with the
preferential a2a- versus a2b/2c-ar antagonist,
brl44,408 (fig. 5 and table 2)
the preferential a2a-ar antagonist, brl44,408, dosedependently blocked the interoceptive effects of s18616 without affecting response rates up to the highest doses evaluated.
contrariwise, the preferential a2b/2c- versus a2a-ar antagonist, brl41,992, failed to block the ds properties of s18616,
even at a dose which significantly decreased response rates.

3.6. lack of blockade of the ds properties of s18616
with a1-ar antagonists (fig. 6 and table 2)
the a1-ar antagonists,  xxxd3000xxx  (which also acts as an antagonist at a2b/2c-ars) and wb4101, failed to block the ds
elicited by s18616 even at doses which significantly decreased
response rates. it was also found that  xxxd3000xxx  (0.16e2.5 mg/
kg, s.c.) did not significantly substitute for s18616: maximal
observed effect, 40% at a dose of 0.63 (data not shown).
3.7. blockade of the ds properties of s18616 with the
antidepressants, mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx 
(fig. 7 and table 2)
the atypical antidepressant agents, mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx , which possess antagonist properties at a2-ars, dosedependently blocked the ds effects of s18616. for both
compounds, response rates were not significantly modified.
in contrast, venlafaxine, an antidepressant which does not
possess significant affinity for a2-ars, was ineffective: 0% of

janssen, 1985; cunningham et al., 1985; jordan et al., 1993;
lal and yaden, 1985).
as pointed out in the section 1, the xylazine cue has not
been thoroughly characterized pharmacologically, but it is interesting to compare the present substitution tests to the findings of jordan et al. (1993) who trained rats to recognise
clonidine (0.02 mg/kg, s.c.). in that investigation, the agonist,
uk14,304, substituted maximally at a dose of 0.16 mg/kg,
a dose which likewise showed full substitution for s18616.
clonidine substituted fully to a clonidine ds, and its lack of
full substitution herein presumably reflects the fact that
s18616 is a high efficacy agonist at a2-ars whereas clonidine
is a partial agonist (buccafusco, 1992; hieble et al., 1995;
millan et al., 2000b, 2000e). in line with this argument, clonidine only partially substituted for the full agonist, xylazine
(colpaert and janssen, 1985). in distinction to clonidine, the
high efficacy agonist,  xxxd2241xxx , fully substituted for the
s18616 ds: this finding mimics studies with a clonidine ds
documented by bennett and lal (1982), lal and yaden
(1985) and jordan et al. (1993). for unclear reasons, however,
 xxxd2241xxx  potently substituted in the present work and in that
of lal and yaden (1985), though it was less active in the studies of jordan et al. (1993) and bennett and lal (1982). in any
case, there is a consensus that  xxxd2241xxx  substitutes for ds

723

elicited by a2-ar agonists, a finding of note in light of its preferential actions at a2a- versus a2b/2c-ar subtypes (vide infra).
further support for a role of a2-ars in the ds properties of
s18616 is provided by its antagonism by the a2-ar antagonists, rx821,002, atipamezole and idazoxan. the relative potency of these antagonists in blocking the s18616 ds was
identical to their rank orders of potencies in antagonising the
analgesic and anxiolytic properties of s18616, and in blocking
its influence upon monoaminergic transmission (millan et al.,
2000b,e). in distinction, the a1-ar antagonists,  xxxd3000xxx  and
wb4101, did not influence the ds properties of s18616. mirroring these antagonism data, the selective a1-ars,  xxxd1707xxx 
and st587 e which elicits a ds in rats (arnt, 1992) e did not
substitute for s18616. these findings coincide with the very
high selectivity of s18616 for a2- versus a1-ars (millan
et al., 2000b).
s18616 also possesses negligible (100-fold lower) affinities
for imidazoline i1 and i2 sites (millan et al., 2000b). inasmuch
as the antagonist, rx821,002, also fails to recognise imidazoline sites (miralles et al., 1993), its blockade of the s18616 ds
underpins the argument that the a2-ar agonist properties of
s18616 are sufficient to elicit a ds. furthermore, neither  xxxd2241xxx  nor guanfacine recognise imidazoline sites (hieble
et al., 1995; millan et al., 1994) yet fully substituted for
s18616. this lack of involvement of imidazoline sites in the
s18616 ds, and its blockade by rx821,002, parallels studies
showing blockade of the clonidine ds by yohimbine and fluparoxan, which likewise do not interact with imidazoline sites
(bennett and lal, 1982; cunningham et al., 1985; jordan
et al., 1993; lal and yaden, 1985). this point is of some importance since the selective i2 ligand, 2-bfi, generated a ds in
rats and cross-generalized to ethoxy-idazoxan, an a2-ar antagonist which interacts with imidazoline (i2) sites: these findings were attributed to their common ability to increase
extracellular levels of noradrenaline (jordan et al., 1996;
macinnes and handley, 2003).
an important question e which has not been previously
addressed e is the identity of the a2-ar subtype mediating the
ds properties of a2-ar agonists. inasmuch as s18616 possesses high affinities for a2a-, a2b- and a2c-ar subtypes
(millan et al., 2000b), they are all potential candidates. support for a major implication of a2a-ars is provided by several
lines of evidence. first, guanfacine and  xxxd2241xxx  are preferential agonists at a2a-ars (hieble et al., 1995; millan et al.,
1994, 2000b) and fully substituted for s18616:  xxxd2241xxx 
also substitutes for clonidine (vide supra). second, the selective antagonist at a2a-ars, brl44,408, blocked the ds properties of s18616, whereas the preferential a2b/2c-ar
antagonist, brl41,992, was ineffective (millan et al., 1994;
renouard et al., 1994; young et al., 1989). third,  xxxd3000xxx ,
which shows significant affinity for a2b/2c versus a2a-ars,
did not block the s18616 ds (hieble et al., 1995; millan
et al., 1994, 2000d; renouard et al., 1994). fourth, involvement of the a2a-ar subtype in the interoceptive effects
of s18616 mirrors their predominant role in its antinociceptive, anxiolytic and sedativeehypnotic properties (millan
et al., 2000b,e). nonetheless, though supporting a role for

724

a. dekeyne, m.j. millan / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 718e726

a2a-ars, the present data should not be considered as definitively excluding a contribution of a2b/2c-ars in the ds properties of s18616 and other a2-ar agonists. this issue will
require additional study in future work, once selective antagonists become available.
reflecting sedative properties, and by analogy to studies of
xylazine and clonidine (colpaert and janssen, 1985; jordan
et al., 1993; bennett and lal, 1982), s18616 and all the
a2-ar agonists evaluated in substitution studies elicited a clear
reduction in response rates. further, during training sessions
with s18616, response rates were lower upon ‘‘drug’’ as compared to ‘‘saline’’ administration. it is probable that the decrease in response rates provoked by s18616 reflects its
agonist properties at a2-ars in view of its very high selectivity
for these sites. moreover, we have previously shown that its
inhibitory influence upon motor function is abolished by selective antagonists at a2-ars (millan et al., 2000e). likewise, the
suppressive influence of other a2-ar agonists tested herein
upon response rates reflects engagement of a2-ars, probably
localized presynaptically to monoaminergic pathways (millan
et al., 1994; hayashi and maze, 1993). interestingly, the motor
actions of s18616 and other a2-ar agonists reflect, like their
ds properties, a role of the a2a-ar subtype (millan et al.,
2000e). nonetheless, there was some dissociation of the influence of drugs upon motor performance and lever selection.
thus first, clonidine, at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg, did not substitute for s18616 yet markedly decreased response rates; second, atipamezole and brl44,408 blocked the s18616 ds
without affecting its reduction in response rates. in contrast,
the influence of s18616 upon response rates was attenuated
by rx821,002 and idazoxan. it is unclear why these antagonists exerted differential effects upon the reduction of response
rates provoked by s18616. one possibility is that doses of
atipamezole or brl44,408 higher than 0.04 and 0.16 mg/kg,
respectively, would have blocked the influence of s18616
upon lever selection e indeed, doseeresponse curves were
stopped once complete antagonism of lever selection had
been achieved. accordingly, higher doses of atipamezole and
brl44,408 (0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively), were needed
to antagonise the motor-suppressant actions of s18616 in a previous study (millan et al., 2000e). an alternative possibility is
that interactions at imidazoline sites are involved, but this is
very unlikely since atipamezole (which recognises these sites)
failed to block the influence of s18616 upon lever selection,
while rx821,002 (which does not recognise imidazoline sites)
did attenuate its influence; third, despite a further decrease in
response rates,  xxxd3000xxx  did not block the s18616 ds and
fourth, st587 dose-dependently decreased response rates
without substituting for s18616.
similar observations of a dissociation between drug influence on response rate and lever selection were reported by
bennett and lal (1982) for a clonidine ds: for example, diazepam and opiates did not substitute despite pronounced decreases in response rates. there is, then, no apparent
relationship between the motor actions of s18616 and other
a2-ar agonists and their ds properties. in a study of spontaneously-hypertensive rats, lal and yaden (1985) suggested

that reductions in arterial pressure may be involved in the
ds properties of clonidine. this is unlikely to be the case
for normotensive subjects (used herein). moreover,  xxxd3000xxx 
and the  xxxg656xxx  agonist, pramipexole (not shown), both
of which reduce arterial pressure (hieble et al., 1995; kujawa
et al., 2000), did not substitute for s18616. nonetheless, as for
most ds elicited by psychotropic drugs, the precise internal
state (psychological and/or somatic) underlying the ds properties of s18616 and other a2-ar agonists remains to be
elucidated.
in this light, an intriguing possibility is that the ds properties of s18616 may be related to its influence upon mood.
though the ‘‘internal state’’ provoked by s18616 certainly
cannot be considered as ‘‘depressed’’, a particularly interesting observation was the blockade of its ds properties by the
antidepressants, mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx , but not venlafaxine. these actions of mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx  reflect e in
contrast to venlafaxine e their marked antagonist properties
at a2-ars (millan, 2006; millan et al., 2000c; nutt and pinder,
1996; sanchez and hyttel, 1999). inasmuch as blockade of
a2-ars tends to favor motor function (hayashi and maze,
1993; kable et al., 2000; millan et al., 1994, 2000e), this action
likely explains the observation that response rates were not suppressed despite their potent histamine h1 antagonist effects and
marked sedative profile in man (benkert et al., 2006; szegedi
and schwertfeger, 2005; millan, 2003, 2006). inasmuch as mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx  block  xxxg1115xxx -mediated ds
properties of the 5-ht reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, and of
the selective 5-ht2c agonist, ro60,0175 (dekeyne et al.,
1999; dekeyne and millan, 2003; millan et al., 2000c), the
present findings suggest that they possess ‘‘compound’’ interoceptive effects expressed via blockade of both 5-ht2c receptors
and a2-ars. by analogy, both of these receptors have been
implicated in the beneficial influence of mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx  upon mood and sexual function (benelli et al., 2004;
gelenberg et al., 2000; millan, 2003, 2006; nutt and pinder,
1996).
though the present study provides several novel insights
into the ds properties of a2-ar agonists, a number of questions remain for future investigation.
first, the present work suggests that activation of a2a-ars
is sufficient and necessary to transduce the ds properties of
s18616 and, perhaps, of other a2-ar agonists. it would be interesting to extend these observations to ds studies of the
preferential a2a-ar agonists, guanfacine and  xxxd2241xxx ,
and to establish whether stimulation of a2b- and/or a2c-ars
can also generate a ds in rodents: however, the lack of preferential agonists at the latter sites renders this task difficult.
a related question is whether selective blockade of a2a-ars
would, by analogy to less selective antagonists like idazoxan
(see section 1), generate a ds.
second, inasmuch as a2a-ars are localized both postsynaptically to adrenergic pathways and presynaptically on their
cell bodies and terminals (hieble et al., 1995; kable et al.,
2000; mateo and meana, 1999; millan et al., 2000d), it is
not possible to assert which of these populations mediates
the ds properties of s18616 and other a2-ar agonists.

a. dekeyne, m.j. millan / neuropharmacology 51 (2006) 718e726

unfortunately, no drug is known to differentiate pre from postsynaptic a2-ars in vivo, but lesion studies may be helpful in
resolving such mechanistic issues, as well as microinjection
studies of drugs into discrete brain regions. inasmuch as  xxxg82xxx  autoreceptors are involved in the anxiolytic and sedative
actions of a2-ar agonists whereas their postsynaptic counterparts transduce their analgesic effects (eisenach et al., 1996;
kable et al., 2000; millan, 2002, 2003; millan et al., 2000d;
schramm et al., 2001), this issue relates to the functional significance of the interoceptive properties of a2-ar ligands
which, as pointed out above, remain to be clarified.
third, notwithstanding this uncertainty, it would be interesting to exploit the s18616 cue in the characterisation of other
psychotropic agents which interact with a2-ars. for example,
we recently found that s35966, an antidepressant that acts as
a mixed a2-ar antagonist and 5-ht reuptake inhibitor (gobert
et al., 2002), likewise antagonises the s18616 ds (unpub. obs.).
further, blockade of a2-ars may be beneficial in the treatment
of negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and in
delimiting extrapyramidal side-effects (millan et al., 2000a;
nutt, 1994). thus, it would be of interest to evaluate the influence of antipsychotics possessing antagonist properties at
a2-ars upon ds elicited by s18616. indeed, though a2-ar
antagonists only partially substituted for a clozapine ds in
determining the roles of specific receptors in the ds effects
of multi-receptorial antipsychotics (goudie et al., 1998), it is
more instructive to examine their actions in subjects trained
with receptor-selective agents (goudie et al., 2004).
5. conclusion
the present study shows that the a2-ar agonist, s18616,
elicits a robust and stable ds in rats that is mediated by
a2-ars rather than by a1-ars or imidazoline sites. further,
a2a-ars as compared to a2b/2c-ars appear to be implicated
in its actions. inasmuch as the atypical antidepressants, mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx , blocked the ds properties of s18616,
this model may be useful not only for evaluating drugs that
selectively target a2-ars, but also in the characterisation of
multi-target antidepressants, antipsychotics and other classes
of centrally-active agent which interact with a2-ars.
