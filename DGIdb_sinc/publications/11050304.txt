abstract
 xxxd1976xxx , a second-generation  xxxd3263xxx  with high affinity for 5-ht1br1d receptors, is highly effective in migraine, with or without aura.
we compared the effects of  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan on the human isolated middle meningeal and coronary arteries and saphenous vein,
used as models for therapeutic efficacy and potential side effects, and have investigated the role of 5-ht1br1d receptors in contractions
induced by these triptans. concentration–response curves to  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan were constructed in the absence or presence of a
selective 5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist, n-w4-methoxy-3-ž4-methylpiperazin-1-yl.phenylx-3-methyl-4-ž4-pyridyl.benzamide žgr125743..
all three blood vessels constricted in response to  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan, but the middle meningeal artery relaxed following the
highest concentration ž100 mm. of  xxxd1976xxx . in the middle meningeal artery, gr125743 antagonised the contractions induced by both
 xxxd1976xxx  žpec 50 : 7.34 " 0.13. and sumatriptan žpec 50 : 6.91 " 0.17. to a similar degree žp a 2 : 8.81 " 0.17 and 8.64 " 0.21, respectively.. in the human coronary artery and saphenous vein, sumatriptan-induced contractions žpec 50 : 6.24 " 0.14 and 6.19 " 0.12,
respectively. were also potently antagonised by gr125743 žp a 2 : 8.18 " 0.27 and 8.34 " 0.12, respectively.. the  xxxd1976xxx -induced
contractions of the human saphenous vein žpec 50 : 6.09 " 0.13. were antagonised less effectively by gr125743 žp k b : 7.73 " 0.18., and
those of the human coronary artery žpec 50 : 5.54 " 0.22. remained unaffected by gr125743 up to a concentration of 100 nm. these
results suggest that ži. based on the differences in pec 50 values, the cranioselectivity of  xxxd1976xxx  ž63-fold. is higher than that of
sumatriptan ž5-fold. in coronary artery, žii. the contractile effects of sumatriptan and  xxxd1976xxx  žlower concentrations. in the three blood

the highest dose of  xxxd1976xxx  ž80 mg. has been shown to
be superior to sumatriptan ž100 mg. in the treatment of
migraine in three head-to-head clinical trials žgoadsby et
al., 2000; saxena and tfelt-hansen, 2000..
it is now generally accepted that the therapeutic action
of sumatriptan and other triptans is mainly due to constriction of dilated intra- and extra-cranial blood vessels, although other mechanisms interfering with the trigeminovascular system may also be involved žde vries et al.,
1999a; saxena and tfelt-hansen, 2000.. indeed, the triptans potently contract human isolated middle meningeal
žlongmore et al., 1998; razzaque et al., 1999., temporal
žverheggen et al., 1996., middle cerebral žhamel and
bouchard, 1991; jansen et al., 1992. and basilar žparsons
et al., 1998. arteries. however, albeit less profound, the
triptans also have the ability to contract non-cranial blood
vessels, such as human isolated pulmonary žmaclean et
al., 1996. and coronary žconnor et al., 1989; chester et al.,
1990; maassenvandenbrink et al., 1998. arteries. constriction of these blood vessels may lead to cardiovascular
adverse events, including myocardial ischaemia and infarction in predisposed individuals žkelly, 1995; o’connor
and gladstone, 1995; ottervanger et al., 1997; main et al.,
1998..
in the present study, we have investigated the contractile effects of  xxxd1976xxx , in comparison to those of sumatriptan, on human isolated blood vessels used as models
with relevance to therapeutic efficacy žmiddle meningeal artery., coronary adverse events žcoronary artery.
and peripheral vasoconstriction žsaphenous vein.. furthermore, we used the competitive 5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist n-w4-methoxy-3-ž4-methylpiperazin-1-yl.phenylx3-methyl-4-ž4-pyridyl.benzamide žgr125743. ždomenech
et al., 1997; pauwels, 1997. in an attempt to characterise
the 5-ht receptors mediating contractions to  xxxd1976xxx  and
sumatriptan.
2. material and methods
2.1. tissue collection
2.1.1. human isolated middle meningeal artery
human middle meningeal arteries were obtained from
10 patients žfour males, six females; age 30–69 years.
undergoing craniotomy at the neurosurgical unit of the
university hospital ‘dijkzigt’, erasmus university medical centre, rotterdam. during the surgical procedure, a
part of the skull is temporarily removed and the dura
matter, together with a small piece of the middle meningeal
artery, is intentionally cut to obtain access to the brain.
this piece of the artery was placed in a plastic tube filled
with ice-cold ž0–4 8c. physiological saline and immediately transported to the laboratory. upon arrival at the
laboratory, the artery was placed in a cold oxygenated
modified krebs bicarbonate solution of the following composition žmm.: nacl 119, kcl 4.7,  xxxg2125xxx  2 1.25,  xxxd2534xxx 

1.2, kh 2 po4 1.2, nahco 3 25 and glucose 11.1; ph 7.4.
the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin ž0.1 mm. was
added to the krebs solution to prevent prostaglandin synthesis. excess tissue surrounding the artery was carefully
removed and no attempt was made to remove the endothelium. the middle meningeal artery was used within 2 h of
surgery.
2.1.2. human isolated coronary artery and saphenous õein
the human right epicardial coronary artery was obtained from 11 ‘heart-beating’ organ donors žsix males,
five females; 17–52 years., who died of non-cardiac disorders žeight to cerebrovascular accidents; three to brain
trauma.. the hearts were provided by the heart valve
bank, rotterdam, the netherlands after donor mediation
by bio implant services foundationreurostransplant
foundation, leiden, the netherlands žfor details, see
maassenvandenbrink et al., 1998.. leftover human
saphenous vein was obtained postoperatively from 13 patients žseven males, six females; age 34–81 years. undergoing coronary bypass surgery. saphenous vein was immediately placed in cold saline and was brought to the
laboratory within 15 min.
upon arrival in the laboratory, the right coronary artery
and saphenous vein were cleaned from the surrounding
tissue and placed in a cold, oxygenated krebs bicarbonate
solution of the following composition žmm.: nacl 118,
kcl 4.7,  xxxg2125xxx  2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, kh 2 po4 1.2, nahco 3
25 and glucose 8.3; ph 7.4. no attempt was made to
remove the endothelium. the artery and vein were stored
overnight in cold oxygenated krebs solution and were
used the following day.
2.2. experimental protocol
2.2.1. human isolated middle meningeal artery
the middle meningeal artery was cut into circular 3- to
4-mm-long segments, which were mounted on metal prongs
in 10-ml organ baths containing krebs bicarbonate solution, aerated with 95% o 2 and 5% co 2 and maintained at
a temperature of 378c. changes in isometric tension were
measured by a force displacement transducer and recorded
with iox 1.203h software žboth, emka technology,
paris, france. . segments were stretched to a passive tension of 4 mn and were allowed to stabilise at this level for
60 min žwith replacement of krebs solution every 15 min..
all segments were then exposed 2–3 times to 0.1 mm
prostaglandin f2 a to demonstrate reproducibility of the
evoked contractions. subsequently, the segments were
pre-contracted with prostaglandin f2 a ž1 mm. and the
relaxation response to  xxxg2240xxx  ž10 nm. was used to
evaluate the presence of a functional endothelium. after
washing, the segments were allowed to equilibrate for 60
min, with replacement of buffer every 15 min. the segments were then used in a paired parallel experimental
set-up, incubating with the 5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist

r.w.m. õan den broek et al.r european journal of pharmacology 407 (2000) 165–173

gr125743 ž10 and 30 nm. or vehicle for 30 min. subsequently, a single cumulative concentration–response curve
to either  xxxd1976xxx  or sumatriptan žboth 1 nm to 100 mm.
was constructed in each segment.
2.2.2. human isolated coronary artery and saphenous õein
vessels were cut into ring segments of approximately
4-mm length and were suspended on stainless steel hooks
in 15-ml organ baths containing krebs bicarbonate solution, aerated with 95% o 2 and 5% co 2 and maintained at
a temperature of 378c. vessel segments containing macroscopically visible atherosclerotic lesions were not used.
changes in tension were recorded using a harvard isometric transducer. the segments were allowed to equilibrate
for at least 30 min and were washed every 15 min.
segments were stretched to a passive tension of 15 mn
žcoronary artery. or 10 mn žsaphenous vein., respectively.
all segments were then exposed to kcl ž30 mm. twice, to
demonstrate the reproducibility of the evoked contractions.
subsequently, the functional integrity of the endothelium
was verified by observing relaxation to  xxxg2240xxx 
žcoronary artery, 1 nm. or bradykinin žsaphenous vein, 0.1
mm. after pre-contraction with prostaglandin f2 a ž1 mm..
after washout, the tissue was exposed to kcl ž100 mm. to
determine the maximal contractile response to kcl. the
tissue was washed and then was allowed to equilibrate for
another period of 30 min. after this equilibration period
the segments were divided in a paired parallel experimental set-up and were incubated with the 5-ht1br1d receptor
antagonist gr125743 žcoronary artery: 3 nm to 1 mm;
saphenous vein: 3–30 nm. or with vehicle for 30 min.
subsequently, a single cumulative concentration–response
curve to  xxxd1976xxx  or sumatriptan žboth 1 nm to 100 mm.
was constructed in each segment.
2.3. data analysis
2.3.1. concentration–response curões
contractile responses were expressed as percentage of
the contractile response to 1 mm prostaglandin f2 a žmiddle
meningeal artery. or 100 mm kcl žcoronary artery and
saphenous vein.. the occasional spontaneous phasic contractions observed in some coronary artery and saphenous
vein segments were not considered in the calculations, but
the respective plateau contraction levels were used. initially, we calculated the mean value of the individual
maximum contractile responses ž emax . to  xxxd1976xxx  or
sumatriptan; in case the contractions did not reach a
plateau in an individual experiment, the contraction induced by the highest concentration used ž100 mm. was
considered as emax . we then analysed mean concentration–response curves with a non-linear regression fitting
technique for sigmoidal functions with variable slope using
graphpad prism 3.0 žgraphpad software inc., san diego,
ca, usa. to obtain hill slopes for the agonists in the

167

absence or presence of different concentrations of
gr125743. when mean emax values and hill slopes were
not significantly different, we assumed that gr125743
behaved as a competitive antagonist. the whole data set
was then transformed using spss 7.5 non-linear regression
statistics žspss inc., chicago, il, usa. into a dependent
fitting model, where the emax values were set to the
respective agonist control emax . this model enabled us to
obtain valid s.e.m. and 95% confidence intervals of mean
pec 50 values and dose ratios. using the pec 50 values that
were significantly different from their respective controls,
schild regression analysis was performed žspss inc.. to
calculate antagonist p a 2 žg 3 concentrations of
gr125743., apparent p a 2 ž2 concentrations of gr125743
with slope set to unity. or p k b ž1 concentration of
gr125743 with slope set to unity.. when the ratio between ec 50 values in the absence or presence of antagonist
was larger than 1, the dose ratio was calculated.
2.3.2. statistical analysis
differences between emax , hill slopes and pec 50 values of vehicle and antagonist-treated groups were analysed
according to one-way analysis of variance žanova.,
followed by dunnett’s multiple comparison t-test žgraphpad software inc... differences in potency, efficacy and
logarithmically transformed dose ratios between the agonists were analysed according to tukey’s unpaired t-test
žgraphpad software inc... cranioselectivity ratios were
calculated as the inverse logarithmic difference between
pec 50 values of agonists in middle meningeal artery and
either coronary artery or saphenous vein. the 95% confidence limit ž95% ci. of cranioselectivity ratios obtained
with  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan were calculated and compared as described by steel and torrie ž1980.. in all cases,
statistical significance was assumed when p - 0.05. except for dose ratios and cranioselectivity ratios, where the
geometric means with 95% ci are given, all other data are
presented as mean " s.e.m.
2.4. ethical approõal
the medical ethics committee of the erasmus medical
centre rotterdam, which deals with the use of human
material for scientific experiments, approved the protocols
for this investigation.
2.5. compounds
bradykinin acetate, 5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulphate žserotonin; 5-ht., indomethacin hydrochloride,

ž5-fold each. were significantly more selective for the
meningeal artery. the cranioselectivity for  xxxd1976xxx  in the
coronary was significantly higher than that for sumatriptan.

4. discussion
in the present study, we investigated the effects of
 xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan on the human isolated middle
meningeal artery as a model for anti-migraine activity, and
coronary artery and saphenous vein as models for peripheral vascular side-effect potential. in addition, the role of
5-ht1br1d receptors in the vasoconstrictor responses to
the two triptans was evaluated using gr125743, a potent

and competitive 5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist ždomenech
et al., 1997; pauwels, 1997..
4.1. efficacy profile of  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan in blood
õessels
it is well known that acutely acting  xxxd2022xxx  drugs,
such as the triptans, have a vasoconstrictor effect, particularly on cranial vessels žde vries et al., 1999a; saxena and
tfelt-hansen, 2000.. indeed,  xxxd1976xxx  contracted human
isolated blood vessels used in this investigation with a
maximum response similar to that of sumatriptan žsee emax
values in table 1.. this is in accordance with our previous
study in human vessels, where 5-ht also showed a similar
emax žmaassenvandenbrink et al., 2000., but contrasts
with observations in the canine basilar artery and saphenous vein, where  xxxd1976xxx  behaved as a partial agonist
žgupta et al., 1999.. however, it must be pointed out that
in our experiments the efficacy of  xxxd1976xxx  was not
studied after receptor alkylation, thus not ruling out the
partial agonist nature of  xxxd1976xxx  in human blood vessels.
unlike sumatriptan, the highest concentration of  xxxd1976xxx  ž100 mm. elicited a profound relaxation of the human
middle meningeal. the exact reason for this difference
between  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan is not known. however, a possible explanation could be that at such high
concentrations, which are well beyond the clinically relevant free ži.e., protein unbound. plasma cmax values of
around 30 and 65–90 nm obtained after 40 and 80 mg oral
 xxxd1976xxx , respectively žpersonal communication a.d.
mcharg; milton et al., 1998., the contraction elicited by
 xxxd1976xxx  was overruled by vasorelaxation mediated by the
5-ht7 receptor žeglen et al., 1997; saxena et al., 1998;

r.w.m. õan den broek et al.r european journal of pharmacology 407 (2000) 165–173

terron and falcon-neri, 1999.. the 5-ht7 receptor mrna
has been detected in human meningeal vessels žschmuck
et al., 1996. and at this receptor  xxxd1976xxx  žp k i : 6.70 "
0.06. has a higher affinity than sumatriptan žp k i : 5.86 "
0.11. žnapier et al., 1999.. interestingly,  xxxd1976xxx  relaxed
neither the coronary artery nor saphenous vein; the 5-ht7
receptor mrna is poorly expressed in the human coronary
artery žnilsson et al., 1999b..
4.2. effects of gr125743 on contraction elicited by  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan
the contractions elicited by sumatriptan were competitively antagonised by gr125743 in the human middle
meningeal and coronary arteries as well as the saphenous
vein with similar p a 2 values ž8.64, 8.18 and 8.34, respectively; table 1.. these values resemble the affinity estimates of gr125743 at 5-ht1br1d receptors in radioligand
binding žp k i : 8.2–9.0, audinot et al., 1997; domenech et
al., 1997. and functional studies against sumatriptan-induced contractions of the human isolated middle meningeal
artery žp k b : 9.1, razzaque et al., 1999.. the results reveal
that sumatriptan acts on the same 5-ht receptor žmost
probably 5-ht1b , kaumann et al., 1993. in all three blood
vessels studied. indeed, elegant in situ hybridisation and
immunohistochemistry experiments have demonstrated that
the 5-ht1b but not  xxxg1110xxx  mrna and protein
are present in the smooth muscles of human middle
meningeal and coronary arteries žbouchelet et al., 1996;
longmore et al., 1997, 1998; nilsson et al., 1999a,b.. in
addition, selective  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonists
failed to constrict the human cerebral arteries, excluding a
role for these receptors in vasomotor responses žennis et
al., 1998; bouchelet and hamel, 1999; cohen and schenck,
1999.. finally, the selective  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist
2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1x -methyl-5-w 2 x -methyl-4x ž 5-methyl1,2,4-oxadiazo-l-3-yl. biphenyl-4-carbonylxfurow2,3, f xindole-3-spiro-4x-piperidine hydrochloride žsb224289. antagonises sumatriptan-induced vasoconstrictor responses
žverheggen et al., 1998; de vries et al., 1999b.. thus,
there is now overwhelming evidence that the 5-ht1b žnot
 xxxg1110xxx  . receptor mediates vasoconstrictor responses to the
triptans.
the contraction of the middle meningeal artery by
 xxxd1976xxx  was antagonised by gr125743 with a p a 2
ž8.81; table 1. that was similar to that against
sumatriptan-induced contraction in this artery and  xxxd1976xxx -induced contractions in the dog isolated basilar artery
and saphenous vein žp a 2 values: 9.1 and 9.4, respectively.
žgupta et al., 1999.. however, in the coronary artery and
saphenous vein, gr125743 appeared to block eletriptaninduced contractions in a slightly different manner compared to those by sumatriptan. in the coronary artery,
higher concentrations of gr125743 žg 300 nm. revealed
a non-sigmoidal nature of the concentration–response
curves to  xxxd1976xxx , whereas lower concentrations žf 100

171

nm. of gr125743 failed to block  xxxd1976xxx -induced contractions žfig. 2.. in the saphenous vein, the hill slope of
 xxxd1976xxx  was significantly different from unity, indicating
the involvement of more than one mechanism and, accordingly, gr125743 caused a rightward shift in the concentration–response curve to  xxxd1976xxx  only with the highest
concentration used ž30 nm; fig. 3.. moreover, the dose
ratio of  xxxd1976xxx  following 30 nm gr125743 ž3.4. was
significantly lower than that of sumatriptan ž18.. the
discrepancy between antagonism by gr125743 against
 xxxd1976xxx -induced contraction in the coronary artery and
saphenous vein and the results obtained in dog basilar
artery and saphenous vein žgupta et al., 1999. may well be
species related or could be based on methodological differences, as we have not used the mixed 5-ht2r7 receptor
antagonist mesulergine in our experiments.
overall, these data suggest that the sumatriptan-induced
contraction in the three vessels examined is mediated by
the  xxxg1109xxx . furthermore, the contractile effects of
 xxxd1976xxx  at lower concentrations is largely mediated by
the  xxxg1109xxx  but an additional receptorrmechanism, unaffected by gr125743, contributes to some extent
in the contractions of the human coronary artery and
saphenous vein elicited by high concentrations of  xxxd1976xxx . this is indirectly supported by our experiments in
the anaesthetised pigs, where we reported that, unlike
sumatriptan žde vries et al., 1996., the  xxxd1976xxx -induced
constriction of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses was
not completely blocked by gr127935, another potent
5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist žwillems et al., 1998.. the
exact nature of this additional mechanism involved in
 xxxd1976xxx -induced contraction is unknown, but it is conceivable that a part of the contraction to high concentrations of  xxxd1976xxx , particularly after blockade of the 5-ht1b
receptor by gr125743, may be mediated via the 5-ht2a
receptor. in contrast to the human middle meningeal artery
that predominantly possesses  xxxg1109xxx  population
žjansen et al., 1992; razzaque et al., 1999., it is known
that both human coronary artery and saphenous vein have
a mixed population of 5-ht1b and 5-ht2 receptors žconnor et al., 1989; bax et al., 1992, 1993; ishida et al., 1999;
nilsson et al., 1999b.. we must, however, concede that
 xxxd1976xxx  does not differ from sumatriptan with regard to
the affinity at the  xxxg1113xxx  žp k i : both - 5.5,
napier et al., 1999..
4.3. cranioselectiõity of  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan
 xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan contracted the human isolated middle meningeal artery with equal efficacy ž emax :
94 " 8% and 106 " 17% of the contraction to 1 mm
prostaglandin f2 a , respectively. and potency žpec 50 : 7.34
" 0.13 and 6.91 " 0.17, respectively.. the two drugs exhibited cranioselectivity because they were significantly
more potent in contracting the middle meningeal artery
than coronary artery žpec 50 : 5.54 " 0.22 and 6.24 " 0.14,

172

r.w.m. õan den broek et al.r european journal of pharmacology 407 (2000) 165–173

respectively. or saphenous vein žpec 50 : 6.09 " 0.13 and
6.19 " 0.12, respectively; table 1..  xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan were equipotent in the saphenous vein, but in the
coronary artery, as we found earlier with another 5-ht1br1d
receptor agonist 3-w2-ždimethylanimo.ethylx-5-wžtrifluoromethyl.sulfonylxoxyxw1 h xindole oxalate žgmc2021.
žsaxena et al., 1996.,  xxxd1976xxx  was significantly less
potent than sumatriptan. this latter finding appears at
variance with the higher binding affinity of  xxxd1976xxx  for
the 5 ht1b receptor compared to sumatriptan žnapier et
al., 1999., but may involve agonist-specific differences in
stimulus-effector coupling žkenakin, 1987.. it can perhaps
be argued that the lower potency of  xxxd1976xxx  on the
coronary artery may be due to the involvement of the
non-5 ht1br1d mechanism for which  xxxd1976xxx  has a low
affinity žsee section 4.2.. however, we believe that the
contraction elicited via a high affinity site žin this case, the
5 ht1b receptor. would overrule that via a low affinity
site.
based on the difference in pec 50 values, sumatriptan
proved 5-fold ž95% ci: 2–13. more selective for the
meningeal artery compared to both coronary artery and
saphenous vein. this cranioselectivity ratio of  xxxd1976xxx  in
the coronary artery ž63, 95% ci 20–200. was significantly
higher compared to that of sumatriptan ž p - 0.01., whereas
in the saphenous vein the cranioselectivity of  xxxd1976xxx ,
being 18-fold ž95% ci: 8–41., was not different from that
of sumatriptan ž p s 0.06.. admittedly, the data obtained
with  xxxd1976xxx  are complicated by two factors. firstly, the
coronary artery contraction has a non- xxxg1109xxx 
component. however, it is the resultant coronary artery
contraction and not its underlying mechanism that is important for potential coronary side effects. secondly, the
relaxant response in the middle meningeal artery observed
with  xxxd1976xxx  ž100 mm. could well reduce its emax and,
thus, overestimate its pec 50 , compared to sumatriptan.
our results, however, show that the maximal contraction
žand hill slope. by  xxxd1976xxx  is similar to that of sumatriptan as well as 5-ht žsee table 1; maassenvandenbrink et
al., 2000.. although, the relaxant response manifests at the
highest concentration, it cannot be excluded that this response is latently present throughout the concentration
range so that the whole concentration–response curve may
have been shifted to the right. in this case, it is equally
possible that we may have underestimated the pec 50 žand
cranioselectivity. of  xxxd1976xxx .
the cranio-coronary selectivity of  xxxd1976xxx , together
with the clinical data showing that the highest dose of
 xxxd1976xxx  ž80 mg. has a superior efficacy, onset of action
and patient acceptability in the acute treatment of migraine
when compared with oral sumatriptan ž100 mg. žgoadsby
et al., 2000., speak in favour of  xxxd1976xxx . however, it
cannot be overemphasised that  xxxd1976xxx  has the capacity
to constrict the human coronary artery and, therefore, like
the other triptans, must remain contraindicated in patients
with coronary artery disease.
