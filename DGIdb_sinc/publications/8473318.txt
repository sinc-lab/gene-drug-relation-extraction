are available (4-8). in addition to  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone
and a carboxylatable substrate, the carboxylation reaction
requires cos and o2 as substrates. the carboxylase activity
has been associated with a  xxxd3522xxx  epoxidase activity, and
the available data indicate carboxylation is coupled to epoxidation (6). most studies of the carboxylase activity have used
detergent-solubilized microsomes and synthetic peptide substrates and have measured the amount of l4co2incorporated
into the peptide. the millimolar k,,, concentrations of these
peptides (9) are too high to be physiologically relevant, and it
has been shown that theprecursor forms of native substrates
contain acarboxylase-binding site that binds carboxylase with
submicromolar affinity (10-12). in blood-clotting factors and
 xxxg260xxx , this “propeptide” region is at the amino
terminus and is removed by a peptidase following carboxylation. although the propeptide is believed to function primarily
as a “docking site” for the carboxylase, it may also serve as
an allosteric effector, asit lowers the k , of the peptide
substrates somewhat (10, 11, 13). the carboxylase is an integral membrane protein that resides in the rough endoplasmic
reticulum (14) and that has recently been purified (15) and
cloned (16). the deduced amino acid sequence suggests two
major domains, including an amino-terminal hydrophobic
domain that containsthree probable membrane-spanning
regions and a hydrophilic domain that shows homology to a
known epoxidase (16).
in crude, solubilized microsomes, the carboxylase activity
shows a ph optimum around 7.0 and a sensitivity to salt
concentration (9,17). stimulators of the activity include dtt
(9, 18, 19), ammonium sulfate (20, 21), and divalent metal
ions (5,22). thesulfhydryl-reactive agents  xxxd2684xxx

 xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase, purified from bovine liver,has properties similar to those reported for
the carboxylase activity present in crude, solubilized
microsomes. the purified carboxylase was found to
possess the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxidase activity, believed to
be essential for  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylation,
but did not contain  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase activity. kinetic studies of the carboxylase done under defined conditions were complicated by the non-michaelis-menten kinetic behavior observed for reactions
with two of the enzymes substrates, fleel and  xxxd2941xxx  hydroquinone. initial rate experiments with
the substrate fleel demonstrated behavior consistent with substrate inhibition and gave half-maximal
activity at 1 mm fleel. experiments with the substrate  xxxd2941xxx  hydroquinone also displayed nonmichaelis-menten kinetics, as maximal activity was
reached prematurely in relation to behavior at lower
concentrations. half-maximal activity wasobserved at
35 pm  xxxd2941xxx  hydroquinone. initial rate experiments with varyingnah1*cosconcentration displayed

the example shown in fig. 2 demonstrates. onepossible
explanation for this is the presence of two forms of carboxylase with different first-order decay rates, and the curve in

carboxylase has a half-time of decay of 6 h and43% of 69 h.
once the carboxylase was diluted in the reaction mixture,
it was much more stable at room temperature. this is evident
in the linearity of the reaction and in the uninhibited control

noncompetitive inhibition seems unlikely, it is very possible
that warfarin is acting as an irreversible inhibitor, resulting
in a common artifact that yields data that appear noncompetitive (34). following a 30-min preincubation with 1 mm
warfarin, removal of 90% of the warfarin by washing (details
under "materials and methods") resulted in the recovery of
none of the inhibited activity. in this experiment, washed
uninhibited controls retained 90% of the activity observed in
uninhibited controlsthat were not washed. to demonstrate a
time dependence to warfarin inactivation of carboxylase, we
preincubated the carboxylase with 1.25 mm warfarin for various times prior to thecarboxylation assay (fig. 7 b ) .because
most inactivation occurred even in the absence of a warfarin
preincubation, only a modest time-dependent effect was observed. like nem, the decay rate observed for warfarin
inactivation of carboxylase was not pseudo first-order. neither  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide orvitamin k1 hadany effect on
warfarin inactivation of carboxylase. duringthese experiments it was noticed that 4% ethanol inhibited carboxylase
from 30 to 50%, whereas ethanol at 2% or less had no
inhibitory effect. the uninhibited control in fig. 7 b demonstrates the relative stability of carboxylase under conditions
very similar to reaction conditions.

discussion

the initial linearityof the carboxylation reaction indicated
that changes in conditions such as carboxylase inactivation,
loss of nah14c03, and oxidation of vitamin khz were not
large enough to affect linearity. enzyme inactivation and
nah14c0, loss were confirmed to be 10% or less in a halfhour reaction. even a 10% losswould result in a smaller
percent decrease in activity for the entire reaction period and
would probably not be apparent. similarly, during the first
hour of reaction no evidence of time-dependent oxidation of
vitamin khz was observed, as the proportion of reduced and
oxidized vitamin kremained constant. the apparent stability
of vitamin khz under reaction conditions is consistent with
the reaction linearity observed at vitamin khz concentrations
as low as 22 pm. this contrastswith the situation reported in
crude microsomal systems lacking dtt, where oxidation of
vitamin khz is reported to be more rapid (35, 36). although
the reason for this difference is not apparent,the composition
of the purified carboxylase system is significantly different

vitamin ki to compete with vitamin khz probably indicates
the vitamin khz-binding site is not available to the other
forms. however, our lack of knowledge about how the various
forms of  xxxd2941xxx  partition between mixed micelles, mixed
vesicles, and aqueous environments or even in which environment and with what orientation vitamin khz is active, suggests caution in making this interpretation.

analyzed, recovery of the reduced form is only 60-70%. for
this reason, we believe much of the low recovery from extracted reactions is due to oxidation during analysis. since
this factor could not be quantitated or eliminated, we have
presented our data without correction for the low vitamin
kh2 recovery, even though this has probably resulted in a
slight overestimation of the concentration at half-maximal
activity. note that the carboxylation reaction with endogenous substrates requires less vitamin khz. the  xxxd2941xxx 
concentration in mammalian liver is about 0.1 p m (39), and
earlier systems using endogenous substrate report lower vitamin kh2requirements (4, 5) than observed in our system.
recently, a study using propeptide-containing substrates has
found a much lower k,,, for vitamin khz (1 pm) in a soluble
microsomal system (40). we have confirmed this with the
substrate fixq/s (27)in our purified system.'

allows estimation of a
of
0.25-0.3
mm,
in agreement
with the low end (38,41,42) of reported values, which range
from 0.2 to 2 mm (6). the presence of endogenous nahc03
is a serious problem in determining the k,,, for nah14c03,
and estimates yielding higher values either do not appear to
have adjusted k,,, in response to the presence of endogenous
nahc03 or used a nonreproducible quantitation technique
(6) for measuring nahc03. however, somewhat different
systems are used, and k,,,(app)
may indeed vary. as pointed out
will be the observed
by uotila (38), the actual km(app)
for nah14c03minus the endogenous nahc03 concentration.
in our assays, deionized h 2 0 was used for all solutions, and
this water contained less than 5 p~ nahc03 asestimated by
acidification and ir spectroscopy. however, when a large
volume of reaction mixture was prepared from stock solutions
including carboxylase and lacking only fleelandnah14c03,the nahc03concentration had risen to 40 p ~the
.
small volumes used in the reaction would have somewhat
higher endogenous levels, as theywere exposed to atmospheric
c02 during set up and reaction. fortunately, this must be a
small effect, as the reaction is linear even at low nahi4co3
concentrations. elimination of this variable requires precise
control and measurement of endogenous nahc03 under reaction conditions and is not presentlypossible for us. for this
reason, and because the correction is not too large, we have
presented our results without correction.
oxygen wasclearly required for carboxylation, as deoxygenation with a glucose-glucose oxygenasesystem under a nitrogen atmosphere eliminated more than 99% of carboxylase
activity. performing reactions under an oxygen atmosphere,
which should result in nearly a &fold increase in dissolved
oxygen concentration, increased activity only 20%. this behavior suggests the dissolved oxygenconcentration inequilibrium with the atmosphere is above k,,,, as previously reported
(6, 41) and that thedissolved oxygen concentration under an
oxygen atmosphere is well above k,. in order to determine
v, of carboxylase, it is necessary to have all four substrates

free sulfhydryl groups probably near, or part of, the active
site of this protein. we found that nem inhibited purified
carboxylase to the same extent as it inhibits the carboxylase
activity in crude soluble microsomes (23). it has been suggested that a free sulfhydryl, protected from nem inactivation by vitamin khz, is involved in the epoxidase activity,
whereas modification of a second sulfhydryl, not protected by
vitamin kh2,blocks only carboxylation activity. such a complex inhibitory mechanism is consistent with the nonpseudo
first-order inactivation rate observed in our study. identification of the responsible sulfhydryl(s) in purified carboxylase
using radioactive nem should clarify the mechanism of inactivation.
in uiuo, the sites of action of the  xxxd3522xxx  antagonist
warfarin are almost certainly the dtt-dependent, vitamin
k, and  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase activities (24, 43, 44).
inactivation of the reductases has been shown to be irreversible in vitro at micromolar warfarin concentrations (43). a t
higher concentrations, warfarin apparently inhibits allof the
known enzymes involved in the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle (24). the
carboxylase activity present in crude soluble microsomes is
reportedly inhibited by warfarin with an ic5oof 2-3 mm (24).
purified carboxylase was also inhibited by warfarin, apparently by an irreversible mechanism and at somewhat lower
concentration than in the crude preparations. although inhibition of the carboxylase occurred at a 1000-fold higher
concentration than thephysiologically relevant reductase inhibition, the fact that all known  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins are inhibited by warfarin (24) suggests that the inhibition is mechanism-based. because the inhibition appears to
be irreversible, the significance of a lower inhibitory concentration is uncertain. it is somewhat surprising that we did not
observe  xxxd3522xxx  protection (any form) of the carboxylase
from warfarin inactivation. the inability of vitamin khz to
protect the carboxylase from warfarin inactivation, the nonfirst-order decay of the carboxylase, and thenonpseudo firstorder decays observed for warfarin and nem inactivation of
the carboxylase are all consistent with the carboxylase having
two functionally different conformations.
recently, berkner et al. (45) reported purification of the
carboxylase to a somewhat higher specific activity than we
previously reported (15). no evidence is presented that this
identical molecular weight protein is different from the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase we had previously purified.
furthermore, the major steps of both purifications are essentially the same (propeptide affinity/cation exchange). the
specific activity in their recent report, which was determined
under different assay conditions, is only 6-fold higher than
observed in our preparations when differences in protein
quantitation technique are accounted for (bovine  xxxg124xxx , used as a protein standardby berkner et al., binds 2.5
times more coomassie blue than igg, which we used (46)).
six-fold is not a large difference, as bothprotein quantitation
by gel scanning and the carboxylase assay are prone to variability. for example, we find that boiling the carboxylase in
sodium  xxxd3215xxx  containing sample buffer will cause an
insoluble precipitate that does not enter the gel, resulting in
an underestimation of protein and an overestimation of specific activity. because identification of the carboxylase as the
major band in our purifications is so strongly supported (15,
16), andbecause all of the carboxylase activity present in our
starting microsomes was recovered in either the retained or
discarded materials,' we are confident our purified carboxylase is correctly identified and fully active. however, it is
possible that activity may be somewhat higher under alternative reaction conditions.
