abstract
several pharmaceuticalsare frequently dispensed to prevent or reduce the occurrence of migraine attacks. the
prophylactic effect of these drugs has been suggested to be caused through blockade of serotonin (5-ht)
receptors of type 5-ht2bor 5-ht2c. to elucidate which of these receptors is involved, we first used radioligand
binding assays to determine the pharmacological profile of the human and rat 5-ht2breceptor. furthermore, the
potency of drugs used in migraine prophylaxis to stimulate or inhibit 5-ht2bor  xxxg1115xxx -mediated
phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis was measured. all these drugs were found to block both human receptors.
correlation of the receptor affinities with the potencies used in migraine prophylaxis showed significant
correlations, which were better for the 5-ht2b( p = 0.001) than for the 5-htzc receptor ( p = 0.005).migraine
headache is thought to be transmitted by the trigeminal nerve from the meninges and their blood vessels. using
the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the expression patterns of all cloned g-protein-coupled
serotonin receptors were analysed in various human meningeal tissues. all tissues expressed 5-ht1dp, ~ - h t ~ a ,
~ - h t ~ xxxg1117xxx 
b , and 5-ht7 mrnas. only trace amounts of  xxxg1115xxx  mrna were found. with organ bath
experiments we showed that the 5-ht2breceptor stimulated the relaxation of the pig cerebral artery via the
release of  xxxd2738xxx . our data support the hypothesis that 5-ht2breceptors located on endothelial cells of
meningeal blood vessels trigger migraine headache through the formation of  xxxd2738xxx .
introduction
migraine is a type of headache afflicting -10-20 % of the population.
there are two main types of migraine (olesen and lipton, 1994).
the first, migraine without aura (previously called common migraine),
is characterized by headache attacks lasting 4-72 h. the headache is
usually severe, unilateral pulsating, and accompanied by nausea,
vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. in the second type, migraine
with aura (previously called classic migraine) the attacks are preceded
by neurological symptoms called aura (visual, sensory, speech or
motor distortions). otherwise, the headache is similar to that in
migraine without aura.
several theories exist which attempt to explain the pathogenesis
of migraine. based on the theory of wolff (1963), migraine was
considered to be a vasospastic disorder with a vasoconstriction
during the migraine aura and a vasodilatation during the headache
phase. several studies measuring regional cerebral blood flow have
shown (lauritzen and olesen, 1984; olesen, 1992) that attacks of
migraine with aura are initiated by a focal reduction in regional
cerebral blood flow, which occurs most commonly in the posterior
part of the brain. subsequently, the low-flow region spreads
forwards to contiguous areas. lauritzen (1994) proposed that these
observed flow changes were secondary to the electrical phenomenon
of spreading depression first described by lea0 (1944). cortical

spreading depression is a short-lasting depolarization wave that
moves across the cortex at a rate of 3-5 d m i n . it must be
noted, however, that this phenomenon has never been recorded in
humans during a migraine attack. migraine without aura does not
seem to be associated with measurable changes in brain tissue
perfusion (lauritzen and olesen, 1984).
a role for the trigeminal nerve in the headache phase of
migraine was proposed by moskowitz and colleagues (1979). the
trigeminal nerve transmits headache pain from the pia and the
dura mater and their blood vessels. electrical stimulation of
trigeminal ganglia results in the release of the vasoactive peptides
calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) and  xxxg2240xxx  (goadsby
et nl., 1988; buzzi et nl., 1991). these peptides dilate blood
vessels and, in addition,  xxxg2240xxx  promotes protein leakage
from blood vessels. thus, a sterile inflammation within the dural
vasculature may result (moskowitz, 1993).  xxxd2738xxx  seems to
be an important molecule in the development of migraine attacks
since  xxxd2741xxx , a donor. of  xxxd2738xxx , causes in
migraineurs a pulsating, dose-dependent headache with several
migraine-like characteristics (olesen et al., 1994). wei and
colleagues (1992) showed that local application of  xxxd2741xxx 
to the pial surface induces cgrp release from perivascular nerve

960 role of meningeal 5-ht2b receptors in migraine
fibres. this implies that the observed increase in cgrp during
migraine attacks may be secondary to  xxxd2738xxx  formation.
since various abnormalities of serotonergic function during a
migraine attack have been documented (fozard and kalkman, 1992;
peroutka, 1993), serotonin (5-ht) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. for example, 5-ht levels in plasma rise slightly
during the migraine aura. at the onset of the headache the levels in
plasma and platelets fall rapidly and remain low during the attack
(sommerville, 1976). at the same time, increased amounts of 5-ht
and its metabolites are excreted in the urine during most attacks. a
role for 5-ht is further supported by the finding that drugs which
cause the release of serotonin from tissue stores, such as reserpine
and fenfluramine, induce migraine attacks. recent research has
therefore focused on the role of 5-ht receptor subtypes in this
~
agonists like sumatriptan
process. while selective 5 - h t i receptor
are effective in the acute treatment of migraine (doenicke et al.,
1988; peroutka and mccarthy, 1989; humphrey et al., 1991), a number
of  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists, like  xxxd2621xxx ,  xxxd1785xxx ,
pizotifen and  xxxd156xxx , are used as prophylactic  xxxd2022xxx 
agents. it is not clear, however, which of the  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes
mediates this prophylactic effect. a role for the  xxxg1115xxx  has
been proposed since the 5-htza-selectiveantagonist  xxxd2419xxx  was
ineffective as a migraine prophylactic agent (fozard and gray, 1989).
this idea is supported by the observation that rn-chlorophenyl
piperazine (mcpp), a 5-ht mimic acting on 5-ht2c receptors,
triggers migraine attacks (brewerton et al., 1988). after the recent
cloning of the rat and human s - h t ~ b
receptor (foguet et al., 1992;
schmuck et al., 1994) an additional candidate of this group of 5-ht
receptors must be considered. by comparing the potencies of various
drugs with migraine prophylactic activity with their affinities to the
pig 5-ht2c and the rat 5-htlb receptor, we found a remarkable
correlation for both receptors (kalkman et al., 1993; kalkman, 1994).
to provide experimental evidence for the involvement of one of
these receptor types in migraine prophylaxis we have now determined
the pharmacological profile of the human ~ - h t ~receptor
b
and
correlated the affinities of several migraine prophylactic drugs to
human ~ - h t and
~ b 5-htzc receptors with their daily doses. additionally, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) technique we have investigated the expression pattern of all
known g-protein-coupled 5-ht receptor subtypes in different human
meningeal tissues. we further demonstrate that endothelial ~ - h t ~
receptors on cerebral blood vessels trigger the release of  xxxd2738xxx .
these data form a link between the vascular and the neuronal theory
of migraine pathogenesis.

it was speculated that the prophylactic effect in migraine treatment
was caused through either 5-ht2, or 5-ht2c receptors (fozard
and kalkman, 1994). to evaluate the role of these receptors in
migraine prophylaxis, we first defined the pharmacological profile
of the human s-ht~breceptor. to determine the affinities of
several drugs commonly used in migraine treatment, membranes
were prepared from transfected hek 293 cells. after expression
of a human  xxxg1114xxx  clone (schmuck et al., 1994) the
membranes displayed a high affinity for [3h]5-ht b,,, = 211
2 50 fmoymg, pkd = 8.35 ? 0.3 (mean value 2 sd, n = 2).
non-transfected cells did not have binding sites (data not shown).
for comparison, the rat s-ht~breceptor (foguet el al., 1992) was
characterized in parallel. for both receptors the affinity for 5-ht
in saturation binding experiments agreed well with that obtained
in competition binding (table 1). inhibition of [3h]5-ht binding
by various drugs resulted in monophasic curves best fitted by a
one-site binding model. for the human receptor we observed the
following rank order of potencies for selected drugs (table 1):
1-naphthyl piperazine =  xxxd2621xxx  >  xxxd2637xxx  = pizotifen >
5-ht = methoxytryptamine > mcpp > yohimbine >
d-propranolol = l-propranolol >  xxxd2419xxx . a comparison with
the binding properties of hek 293 cells expressing the rat

5-ht2, receptor revealed that  xxxd2637xxx , pizotifen, mesulergine, eltoprazine and ketotifen display clearly different binding affinities for the
human and the rat receptors. sumatriptan, a selective 5 - h t i d dagonist
~
frequently used for the acute treatment of migraine headache, did not
show significant affinity for the 5-ht2, receptors.
efficacy of  xxxd2022xxx  drugs on human 5-htzband 5-htzc
receptors
several pharmaceuticals are frequently employed to prevent or
reduce the occurrence of migraine attacks. these ‘prophylactic’
drugs (e.g. pizotifen,  xxxd2637xxx  and propranolol; table 2) display
antagonistic properties on 5-ht2c receptors. therapeutically used
during the acute headache phase are 5-htidreceptor agonists, like
sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine. to determine whether these
ligands activate or block the human 5-ht2, and 5-ht2c receptors,
we measured their ability to stimulate or inhibit phosphatidyl inositol
hydrolysis in hek 293 cells transfected with the human receptor
clones. the data are listed in table 2. examples of the action of
agonists and antagonists on the 5 - w ~
receptor
~
are displayed in
figure 1. the pkd for 5-ht in this assay was 8.22 2 0.08 for the
~ - h t ~receptor
b
(fig. ia), in agreement with that measured in
binding experiments, and 7.93 +- 0.03 for the 5-htzc receptor.
sumatriptan, which did not bind to the human  xxxg1114xxx 
(table 1), failed to stimulate or inhibit phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis
(data not shown). at the 5-ht2breceptor, dihydroergotamine showed
an agonistic response with a pkd of 8.06 ? 0.33 and -70% efficacy
compared to 5-ht (fig. ia). all tested drugs with ‘prophylactic’
properties were unable to stimulate phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis
via 5-ht2, or 5-ht2c receptors (data not shown) but showed clear
antagonistic effects, with pkb values comparable to those obtained
in competition binding experiments (table 2, fig. ib). in addition,
mcpp, which is known to be a migraine trigger, is a partial agonist
at the human  xxxg1114xxx , displaying a complex dose-response
curve (we did not attempt to fit the data to a mathematical model).
its efficacy was -10-15% compared to 5-ht (fig. ia). as an
antagonist mcpp displayed a pkb of 7.56 2 0.06 (fig. 1b). at the
 xxxg1115xxx  mcpp showed a strong agonistic response, with a
pkd of 8.43 2 0.30 and -85% efficacy compared to 5-ht(table 2).
it is of particular interest that some antagonists, e.g.  xxxd2621xxx  or
 xxxd2637xxx , displayed quite different affinities in drug displacement

964 role of meningeal 5-ht26 receptors in migraine
and inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis (compare tables
1 and 2).
correlations between potency in migraine prophylaxis and
receptor affinities
to evaluate the putative role of these receptors in migraine prophylaxis
we compared the daily doses of eight drugs used for prophylactic
migraine treatment with their affinities to the cloned human s-ht~b
and 5-htzc receptor subtypes, as determined by the inhibition of 5ht induced phosphatidyl inositol turnover. table 2 lists daily dose
ranges and the corresponding references. average concentrations of
logarithmic human daily doses were correlated with the pkb values
at which these drugs inhibit 5-ht2b or 5-htzc receptor-stimulated
phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis (fig. 2). the coefficients for the
correlation between log (mean of the active human dose) and pk6
values for 5-ht2b and 5-htzc receptors were -0.916 (p < 0.001)
and -0.819 (p < 0.01) respectively. spearman rank coefficients
were -0.970 (p << 0.001) and -0.922 (p< 0.005) for 5-ht26 and
5-ht2c receptors respectively.
analysis of serotonin receptor expression in human meningeal
tissues
since migraine headache is thought to stem from the meninges and
their blood vessels, we analysed the serotonin receptor expression in
various preparations from these tissues. from two cases of human
autopsies, arachnoid tissue, internal carotid artery, dura mater and
middle meningeal artery were dissected and cleaned from surrounding
tissue, and rna was prepared. rnas were extensively treated with
dnase to avoid contamination resulting from residual genomic dna.
we have recently described pcr primers which distinguish all known
g-protein-coupled serotonin receptors (ullmer ef al., 1995). the
functionality and specificity of the primers were controlled by rtpcrs with rna from human total brain (fig. 3). confirming earlier
results, we found only a little 5-htzb receptor mrna in total brain
tissue (fig. 3) (foguet et al., 1992; schmuck et al., 1994). we then
used rt-pcr to analyse mrnas for the serotonin receptor subtypes
expressed in the meningeal tissues. contamination with genomic
dna was excluded in all rna preparations by performing the same
rt-fcr procedure without adding reverse transcriptase. in all these
tissues we found expression of 5-htidp,%-itza. ~ - h t ~ xxxg1117xxx 
b , and
5-ht7 receptor mrna (fig. 4a-h). trace amounts of 5-htzc
receptor mrna were found only in the preparations of arachnoid
tissue and in one of the middle meningeal artery preparations (fig.
4a, e, h). this might have been due to contamination with brain
tissue, since rt-pcr with human total brain mrna showed a strong
signal for 5-ht2aand  xxxg1115xxx  mrna (fig. 3). no expression
was found for any other serotonin receptor subtype (data not shown).
modulation of cerebral artery relaxation by 5-htzbreceptors
to demonstrate the functional role of 5-htzb receptors in cerebral
blood vessels, we performed organ bath experiments. do1 was chosen
as the agonist, since this compound is selective for 5-ht2 receptors.
doi-induced contraction via s-ht~areceptors was avoided by
inclusion of  xxxd2419xxx  (30 nm) in the bath fluid. this concentration
of  xxxd2419xxx  is at least 10-fold higher than reported pa2 values for
5-htza-mediatedvascular contraction (leff and martin, 1986). doimediated contractions were not observed in the present experiments
(not shown). after precontraction of the porcine cerebral artery with
lo4 m pgf2, and in the presence of  xxxd2419xxx , do1 produced a
concentration-dependent relaxation. the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist
pizotifen (10” m) abolished the relaxation, thus supporting the 5-

ht2 specificity of the response (fig. 5a). in view of the foregoing,
the receptor involved in the relaxant response to do1 is most likely
the 5-htzbsubtype. it is particularly interesting that the doi-induced
relaxation could be blocked by l-nitroarginine (lo-’ m), an inhibitor
of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (fig. 5b), which demonstrates that the doiinduced response is mediated by the release of  xxxd2738xxx .

discussion
to provide experimental evidence for the role serotonin receptor
subtypes play in the treatment of migraine attacks we first characterized
the pharmacology and function of the recently cloned human 5-ht26
receptor. we had speculated before that this receptor subtype (kalkman
et al., 1993; kalkman, 1994) or the 5-htzc receptor, which has been
known for a longer time (fozard and gray, 1989). is responsible for
the prophylactic action of some  xxxd2022xxx  drugs. while similar
affinities were found for most antagonists, there were pronounced
differences for some drugs when the affinities determined by ligand
binding were compared to those found for the inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis.  xxxd2621xxx  displayed a pkb of 11.24 5
0.16 in the phosphatidyl inositol assay and a pk, of 8.85 ? 0.23 in
binding displacement. for  xxxd2637xxx , we found a pkb of 7.59 2 0.36
and a pki of 8.63 ? 0.40. it seems possible that the receptor displays
different affinities for these antagonists when it is in a state that can
be activated, potentially dependent on different g-protein coupling.
since a functional assay like the inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol
hydrolysis seemed more relevant, we correlated the potencies of
antagonists on the ~ - h t or
~ bthe 5-htlc receptor, determined in the
phosphatidyl inositol assay, with their potency in migraine prophylaxis. for both receptors, there was a significant correlation which
was better for the 5-htzs (p = 0.001) than for the 5-htzc (p =
0.005) receptor. dl-propranololand o-propranolol show equal potency
in migraine treatment (sjaastad and stensrud, 1972). d-propranolol
and l-propranolol displayed similar affinities for the 5-htzbreceptor
(pkb = 6.34 -+ 0.01 and 6.78 ? 0.08 respectively), while their
affinities to the  xxxg1115xxx  differ by an order of magnitude
(pkb = 4.21 5 0.22 and 5.30 ? 0.35 respectively). this makes the
5-htzbreceptor a more likely candidate as mediator of the migraine
prophylactic activity than the  xxxg1115xxx . it should be noted,
however, that such reasoning may be complicated by pharmacokinetic
differences between the various drugs.
since the brain itself is not sensitive to pain and headache is
transmitted from the meninges and their blood vessels via the
trigeminal nerve, the expression of serotonin receptor subtypes in
meningeal tissues was investigated. we used an rt-pcr approach
(ullmer et al., 1995) to distinguish all known g-protein-coupled
serotonin receptors. in all parts of the meninges analysed, we found
expression of 5 - h t l ~ p5-htza,
,
5-ht2b, xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors.
only in the arachnoid tissue preparations and in one of the middle
meningeal artery preparations did we find trace amounts of 5-htlc
receptor mrna. since this receptor is, unlike the 5-htzb receptor,
strongly expressed in brain tissue, this weak expression may be due
to contamination with neuronal material. no other type of 5-ht
receptor mrna was found in meninges. the pattern of serotonin
receptor expression in all layers of the meninges closely resembles
that found in a recent study of 5-ht receptor expression in blood
vessels (ullmer er al., 1995). in that study we found that endothelial
cells from several human blood vessels express 5-ht2b, xxxg1117xxx  and
5-htidp receptor mrnas at variable abundances. smooth muscle
cells from the same vessels expressed 5-htidp,5-htza, 5-ht7 and
very little 5-htzbreceptor mrna. therefore, the serotonin receptor
pattern observed in the meningeal layers corresponds to that seen in

endings from the raphe nuclei are concentrated on pial blood vessels
(chan-palay, 1976; edvinsson et a!., 1983), it may be assumed that

meningeal blood vessels are the site where the observed receptor
mrnas are expressed.

blood vessels relaxes the vessel via the release of  xxxd2738xxx .
this highly reactive molecule has been shown to cause migraine
headache in susceptible individuals (olesen er al., 1994). since it
is also known to stimulate the trigeminal nerve when released in
the meninges (wei er al., 1992), activation of endothelial 5-ht2,
receptors may be considered as a link between central events
occumng during the migraine aura or other stressful events which
lead to the activation of the trigeminal nerve and the precipitation
of the migraine headache. this conclusion is in agreement with
the fact that serotonin releasers (fenfluramine, reserpine, red wine)
are able to cause migraine attacks in migraineurs (curzon er al.,
1969; del bene et al., 1977; jarman er al., 1991). the partial 5ht2b/2c agonist mcpp has also been found to induce migraine
attacks (brewerton er al., 1988). we found that this compound
activates the  xxxg1115xxx , while it displays rather low efficacy
on the cloned human  xxxg1113xxx . whether this is sufficient
to induce the attacks or whether these are caused indirectly by,
for instance,  xxxg1115xxx -mediated changes in hormone release
(aulakh et al., 1992) requires further investigation.
it should be noted that other substances which mediate the
formation of  xxxd2738xxx  in endothelial cells can also induce
migraine attacks. infusions of histamine, for instance, have been
shown to cause migraine headache via activation of hi receptors,
which are presumably located on the endothelium (toda, 1990;
ottosson et al., 1991). however, the special role of serotonin as
a natural player in the generation of migraine attacks is documented
by the observation that 5-ht2, receptor antagonists block naturally
occumng migraine attacks, whereas  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists block
only histamine-induced migraine, while they are not effective as
prophylactic  xxxd2022xxx  drugs (anthony et al., 1978; russell,
1979).
moskowitz and his colleagues have postulated that the activated
trigeminal nerve releases cgrp and  xxxg2240xxx  onto meningeal
blood vessels. this may then trigger the formation of more nitric
oxide, after which the process can proceed in circles and a painful
sterile inflammation develops (moskowitz, 1990). if this is correct,
then an intervention at the level of 5-ht2, receptors would not
be useful after this process has started. this is consistent with the
fact that  xxxg1114xxx  antagonists like pizotifen and  xxxd2621xxx 
do not terminate an ongoing migraine attack. according to
moskowitz's theory, this can rather be achieved by activation of
inhibitory 5-htid receptors located on nerve endings of the
trigeminal ganglion using drugs like sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine (rebeck et al., 1994).
irrespective of this point, however, our data support the
hypotheses of fozard and colleagues (fozard and gray, 1989;
fozard and kalkman, 1994) and moskowitz and colleagues
(moskowitz and macfarlane, 1993). 5-ht may be released from
central neurons and activate endothelial ~ - h t ~receptors
b
on
meningeal blood vessels. the resulting production of  xxxd2738xxx 
then stimulates fibres of the trigeminal ganglion and starts a
vicious circle in susceptible individuals. it is an obvious question
why some individuals are sensitive to this process and others are
not. since this question cannot easily be addressed in experimental
systems, an answer may arise from progress that will be made in
the field of human molecular genetics.

blood vessels. this assumption is consistent with our observations.
based on our data, it can be concluded that the receptor is in
fact the 5-fit2b receptor located on the endothelium. we have
further demonstrated that activation of this receptor on cerebral
