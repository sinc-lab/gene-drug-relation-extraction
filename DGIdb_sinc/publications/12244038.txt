it is now increasingly clear that glial cells (astrocytes and
microglia) in the central nervous system (cns)1 induce the
expression of inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (inos) and the
production of no in response to proinflammatory cytokines,
including interleukin-1␤ (il-1␤),  xxxg2296xxx -␣ (tnf␣), and interferon-␥ (ifn-␥) (1– 4). although the no produced
by inos has bactericidal and tumoricidal properties, it also
plays an important role in pathophysiologies of inflammatory
neurological diseases including demyelinating disorders (e.g.
multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalopathy), neurodegenerative disorder like alzheimer’s disease, and in ischemic and traumatic brain injuries associated with the activation
of glial cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines
(5– 8). no derived from activated glial cells is assumed to
contribute to oligodendrocyte degeneration in demyelinating
diseases and neuronal death during ischemia and trauma (5,
6). therefore, characterization of intracellular pathways required to transduce the signal from the cell surface to the
nucleus for the induction of inos is an active area of investigation, since compounds capable of antagonizing signaling
steps for the induction of inos may have therapeutic effect in
no-mediated pathophysiological conditions.
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars), members of the  xxxg1594xxx  superfamily, have been
implicated in a variety of human diseases (9). three isotypes
have been described to date, ppar-␣, ppar-␤, and ppar-␥ (9).
activation of ppar-␣ mainly leads to the induction of a variety
of genes such as those coding for the enzymes for ␤- and
␻-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  (10). gemfibrozil, an activator of
ppar-␣, has been often prescribed in patients to lower the
level of triglycerides (11, 12). this drug decreases the risk of
coronary heart disease by increasing the level of high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and decreasing the level of low density
lipoprotein cholesterol (11, 12). activation of ppar-␣ is also
capable of modifying the stress response by activation of heat
shock factor 1 ( xxxg1604xxx ) and induction of hsp70 (13, 14). recently it has been shown that activation of hsp70 inhibits the
expression of inos in astrocytes (15), suggesting that the expression of inos may also be regulated by activators of

gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of no and the expression of
inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (inos) in human
u373mg astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. similar
to gemfibrozil,  xxxd1724xxx , another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of inos. inhibition of human
inos promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil
in cytokine-stimulated u373mg astroglial cells suggests
that this compound inhibits the transcription of inos.
since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-␣ (ppar-␣), we investigated
the role of ppar-␣ in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of
inos. gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (ppre)-dependent luciferase activity,
which was inhibited by the expression of ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣, the
dominant-negative mutant of human ppar-␣. however,
⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated
inhibition of inos suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits
inos independent of ppar-␣. the human inos promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of
transcription factors, including interferon-␥ (ifn-␥)
regulatory factor-1 (irf-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (isre), signal transducer and
activator of transcription (stat) binding to ␥-activation
site (gas), nuclear factor-␬b (nf-␬b),  xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1), and ccaat/enhancer-binding protein ␤
(c/ebp␤); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors.
the combination of interleukin (il)-1␤ and ifn-␥ induced the activation of nf-␬b, ap-1, c/ebp␤, and gas
but not that of isre, suggesting that irf-1 may not be
involved in cytokine-induced expression of inos in human astrocytes. interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of nf-␬b, ap-1, and c/ebp␤ but
not that of gas in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells.
these results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of inos probably by inhibiting the activation of
nf-␬b, ap-1, and c/ebp␤ and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.

gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of nos in human astrocytes
ppar-␣. therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on
the expression of inos in cytokine-stimulated human u373mg
astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. in the current work, we
present evidence that gemfibrozil markedly inhibited the expression of inos and the production of no in human astrocytes independent of ppar-␣. in addition, reporter gene assays
reveal that gemfibrozil specifically inhibited cytokine-induced
activation of nf-␬b, ap-1, and c/ebp␤ but not that of gas.
these results raise the possibility that gemfibrozil, a common
lipid-lowering drug, may be of therapeutic value in human
neuroinflammatory diseases.

assay of inos promoter-driven reporter activity—construction of
phinos(7.2)luc, the 7.2-kb human inos promoter-luciferase construct, has been described previously (19). cells plated at 50 – 60%
confluence in six-well plates were cotransfected with 1 ␮g of
phinos(7.2)luc and 50 ng of prl-tk (a plasmid encoding renilla
luciferase, used as transfection efficiency control; promega) by lipofectamine plus (invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocol (3, 4).
twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 12 h. firefly and renilla luciferase activities were obtained by
analyzing total cell extract according to standard instructions provided
in the dual luciferase kit (promega) in a td-20/20 luminometer
(turner designs). relative luciferase activity of cell extracts was typically represented as the ratio of firefly luciferase value/renilla luciferase value ⫻ 10⫺3.
assay of transcriptional activities of different proinflammatory
transcription factors—cells plated at 50 – 60% confluence in six-well
plates were cotransfected with 1 ␮g of either pnf-␬b-luc (nf-␬b-dependent reporter construct), pap-1-luc (ap-1-dependent reporter construct), pc/ebp␤-luc (c/ebp␤-dependent reporter construct), pgasluc (gas-dependent reporter construct), or pisre-luc (isredependent reporter construct) and 50 ng of prl-tk using
lipofectamine plus. construction of pc/ebp␤-luc has been described
earlier (4). this c/ebp␤-sensitive promoter contains four consensus
c/ebp␤-binding sites. other reporter constructs (pnf-␬b-luc, pap-1luc, pgas-luc, and pisre-luc) were obtained from stratagene. after
24 h of transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 6 h.
firefly and renilla luciferase activities were obtained as described
above.
statistics—statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by student’s t test.
results

gemfibrozil inhibits the expression of inos in cytokinestimulated human u373mg astroglial cells—cells were cultured in serum-free media in the presence of il-1␤ and ifn-␥.
it is evident from table i that il-1␤ and ifn-␥ alone were poor
inducers of no production. however, marked induction of no
production was observed by the combination of il-1␤ and
ifn-␥. this combination of cytokines was used to induce the
production of no in subsequent studies. the inhibition of cytokine-induced production of no by arginase (an enzyme that
degrades the substrate, l-arginine, of nos) and l-nma (a
competitive inhibitor of nos) but not by d-nma (a negative
control of l-nma) suggests that the combination of il-1␤ and
ifn-␥ induces the production of no in u373mg astroglial cells
through nos-mediated arginine metabolism (table i). next we
examined the effect of gemfibrozil, an activator of ppar-␣ (20),
on the cytokine-induced nitrite production in u373mg glial
cells. gemfibrozil itself was neither stimulatory nor much in-

reagents—fetal bovine serum and dmem/f-12 were from invitrogen. human recombinant ifn-␥, il-1␤, and tnf-␣ were purchased
from r & d systems.  xxxd3291xxx  (l-nma) and d-ngmonomethylarginine (d-nma) were obtained from biomol. gemfibrozil
and  xxxd1724xxx  were obtained from sigma. antibodies against human
macrophage inos were obtained from calbiochem. 125i-labeled protein
a and [␣-32p]dctp (3000 ci/mmol) were purchased from perkinelmer
life sciences. peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (ppre)-dependent reporter construct (tk-pprex3-luc) and dominant-negative
mutant of ccaat/enhancer-binding protein ␤ (⌬c/ebp␤) were kindly
provided by dr. ronald m. evans of the salk institute and dr. steve
smale of the university of california at los angeles, respectively.
preparation of human astrocytes—human cns tissue was obtained
from the human embryology laboratory, university of washington,
seattle. the cns tissue from each specimen was processed separately
and independently, as were subsequent cell cultures; there was no
pooling of cns tissue from distinct specimens. all the experimental
protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional review
board (irb number 224-01-fb) of the university of nebraska medical
center. these cells were grown in a serum-free, defined medium (b16)
enriched with 5 ng of  xxxg787xxx  per ml for optimal
growth of astrocytes and for the suppression of fibroblast growth (16).
by immunofluorescence assay, these cultures homogeneously expressed
 xxxg883xxx  (gfap). cells were trypsinized, subcultured, and stimulated with cytokines in serum-free dmem/f-12 medium to induce the production of no. the human u373mg astrocytoma
cell line, purchased from the american type culture collection (atcc),
was also maintained and stimulated under similar conditions.
assay for no synthesis—synthesis of no was determined by assay
of culture supernatant for nitrite, a stable reaction product of no with
molecular oxygen, using griess reagent (1– 4). briefly, 400 ␮l of culture
supernatant was allowed to react with 200 ␮l of griess reagent and
incubated at room temperature for 15 min. the optical density of the
assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. fresh
culture medium served as the blank in all experiments. nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of nano2 in the assay. protein was measured by the procedure of
bradford (17).
immunoblot analysis for inos—immunoblot analysis for inos was
carried out as described earlier (2– 4). briefly, cells were detached by
scraping, washed with hanks’ buffer, and homogenized in 50 mm trishcl (ph 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 5 ␮g/ml antipain, 5 ␮g/ml pepstatin a,
and 5 ␮g/ml leupeptin). after electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the inos band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against human inos and 125ilabeled protein a (2– 4).
rna isolation and northern blot analysis—cells were taken out of
the culture dishes directly by adding ultraspec-ii rna reagent (biotecx
laboratories, inc.), and total rna was isolated using ultraspec-ii rna
reagent (biotecx laboratories inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. for northern blot analyses, 20 ␮g of total rna was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to hybond-nylon membrane (amersham biosciences) and hybridized at 68 °c with 32p-labeled cdna probe using express hyb
hybridization solution (clontech) as described by the manufacturer.
the cdna probe was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification
using two primers (forward primer, 5⬘-ctc ctt caa aga ggc aaa
aat a-3⬘; reverse primer, 5⬘-cac ttc ctc cag gat gtt gt-3⬘)
(2– 4, 18). after hybridization filters were washed two or three times in
solution i (2⫻ ssc, 0.05% sds) for 1 h at room temperature followed by
solution ii (0.1⫻ ssc, 0.1% sds) at 50 °c for another hour. the membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (eastman kodak

gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of nos in human astrocytes

hibitory to no production in control cells. however, gemfibrozil, when added 2 h before the addition of cytokines, markedly
inhibited cytokine-induced production of no (table i).
to determine whether inhibition of cytokine-induced no
production by gemfibrozil was simply due to delayed induction,
we measured no concentrations in cytokine-stimulated cultures maintained up to 48 h. when cells were stimulated in the
absence of gemfibrozil, no was detected in culture supernatants after 8 h and increased progressively thereafter for 48 h,
the duration of the experiment (fig. 1). however, when 200 ␮m
gemfibrozil was added 2 h before the addition of the combination of il-1␤ and ifn-␥, production of no was significantly
inhibited (fig. 1). in our studies, maximal suppression of no
production was observed when gemfibrozil was added 2 h before the addition of cytokines (data not shown). when gemfibrozil was added after the addition of cytokines, the extent of
inhibition progressively decreased (data not shown). it is evident from fig. 2a that gemfibrozil dose-dependently inhibited
cytokine-induced production of no. although at 50 ␮m concentration, gemfibrozil was not a potent inhibitor of cytokineinduced no production, it inhibited the induction of no production by more than 80% at 200 ␮m concentration. to
understand the mechanism of inhibition, we examined the
effect of gemfibrozil on protein and mrna level of inos in
cytokine-stimulated cells. consistent with the effect of gemfibrozil on cytokine-induced production of no, gemfibrozil dosedependently inhibited cytokine-induced expression of inos
protein (fig. 2b) and mrna (fig. 2c).
next we investigated the possibility whether gemfibrozil inhibited cytokine-induced expression of inos mrna by decreasing the stability of inos mrna. human u373mg astroglial cells were stimulated with the combination of il-1␤ and
ifn-␥ under serum-free condition. after 6 h of stimulation,
cells were treated with  xxxd1800xxx  d (an inhibitor of rna
synthesis) in the presence or absence of 200 ␮m of gemfibrozil.
at different h of treatment with  xxxd1800xxx  d, the level of
inos mrna was analyzed by northern blot. it is apparent
from figure 3, a and b, that the relative rate of degradation of
inos mrna (inos/ xxxg861xxx ) in the presence or absence of

cells preincubated with different concentrations of gemfibrozil for 2 h
in serum-free dmem/f-12 received the combination of il-1␤ (10 ng/ml)
and ifn-␥ (10 units/ml). a, after 24 h of stimulation, the concentration
of nitrite was measured in the supernatants. data are mean ⫾ s.d. of

inos as described under “materials and methods.” c, after 6 h of
stimulation, total rna was isolated, and northern blot analysis for
inos mrna was carried out as described under “materials and
methods.”

gemfibrozil at different time periods remained almost same
suggesting that gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of inos
mrna is not due to any alteration of the stability of inos
mrna.
inhibition of cytokine-induced expression of inos by  xxxd1724xxx  in human u373mg astroglial cells—to investigate
whether other fibrate drugs are also capable of inhibiting cytokine-induced production of no and expression of inos in
astrocytes, we examined the effect of  xxxd1724xxx .  xxxd1724xxx  is
also a hypolipidemic drug that activates ppar-␣ and induces
proliferation of peroxisomes in rats and mice (9, 20, 21). similar
to gemfibrozil,  xxxd1724xxx  itself was neither stimulatory nor
much inhibitory to no production; however, it dose-dependently inhibited the production of no (fig. 4a) and the expression of inos protein (fig. 4b) in cytokine-stimulated u373mg
astroglial cells. these studies suggest that fibrate drugs, in
general, are inhibitory to cytokine-induced expression of inos
in human astroglial cells.
inhibition of cytokine-induced production of no by gemfibrozil in human primary astrocytes—human primary astrocytes have been shown to induce the expression of inos in the
presence of different proinflammatory cytokines (22–24). since
gemfibrozil potently inhibited the expression of inos in human
u373mg astroglial cells, we examined the effect of gemfibrozil
on cytokine-induced expression of inos in human primary
astrocytes. different cytokines alone were poor inducers of no
production (table ii). however, the combination of il-1␤ and
ifn-␥ markedly induced the production of no. the addition of
tnf-␣ to the combination of il-1␤ and ifn-␥ did not further
increase the production of no (table ii). although gemfibrozil
itself had no effect on no production in control cells, preincubation of human primary astrocytes with 200 ␮m of gemfibrozil

phinos(7.2)luc, a construct containing the human inos promoter fused to the luciferase gene (19), and activation of this
promoter was measured after stimulating the cells with cytokines in the presence or absence of gemfibrozil. the combination of il-1␤ and ifn-␥ induced inos promoter-driven luciferase activity by about 3.9-fold (fig. 5). consistent with the
effect of gemfibrozil on the expression of inos, gemfibrozil
itself had no effect on inos promoter-driven luciferase activity
but it dose-dependently inhibited inos promoter-driven luciferase activity in cytokine-stimulated cells (fig. 5), suggesting
that gemfibrozil inhibits cytokine-induced production of no
and the expression of inos mrna by inhibiting the activation
of inos promoter.
role of ppar-␣ in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of inos
in human u373mg astroglial cells—since gemfibrozil is a
known activator of ppar-␣ (9, 20, 21), a member of the nuclear
 xxxg1603xxx  superfamily, we examined whether gemfibrozil inhibited the induction of inos through the activation of
ppar-␣. ppars bind to a consensus sequence known as ppre
(9). therefore, to study the activation of ppar, cells were
transfected with tk-pprex3-luc, a ppre-dependent luciferase
construct, and luciferase activity was measured. as shown in
fig. 6a, gemfibrozil alone was able to induce ppre-dependent
luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner and the maximum induction (⬃4-fold) was observed at 100 ␮m or higher
concentration of gemfibrozil. in contrast, the combination of
il-1␤ and ifn-␥ capable of inducing inos inhibited ppre-dependent luciferase activity (fig. 6a). however, gemfibrozil
treatment blocked the inhibitory effect of cytokines on the
activation of ppre and stimulated ppre-dependent luciferase
activity over basal level even in the presence of cytokines (fig.
6a). to analyze the role of ppar-␣ in gemfibrozil-induced
activation of ppre, we used ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣, the dominant-negative mutant of human ppar-␣ (25). marked abrogation (p ⬍
0.001) of gemfibrozil-induced activation of ppre (fig. 6b) by
the expression of ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ but not that of the empty vector
suggests that gemfibrozil induced ppre-dependent reporter
activity through the activation of ppar-␣ in human astroglial
cells.
next we examined whether ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ can block the inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil on the induction of inos. cells were
cotransfected with phinos(7.2)luc, ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣, and prl-tk
(a plasmid encoding renilla luciferase, used as transfection
efficiency control). after 24 h of transfection, cells were incubated with gemfibrozil for 2 h followed by stimulation with

inos promoter-driven luciferase activity in empty vectortransfected cells (fig. 7). however, despite the ability of ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ to block gemfibrozil-mediated activation of ppre (fig.
6b), the expression of ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ did not block the inhibitory
effect of gemfibrozil on inos promoter-driven luciferase activity in cytokine-stimulated cells (fig. 7). these results suggest
that ppar-␣ is not involved in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition
of inos in human astroglial cells.
effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of proinflammatory
transcription factors in human u373mg astroglial cells—
different proinflammatory transcription factors are known to
be involved in the transcription of inos (2– 4, 26 –30). analysis
of human inos promoter shows that it has consensus sequences for binding of several transcription factors such as
nf-␬b, ap-1, c/ebp␤, irf-1 binding to isre, and stat binding to gas (29 –31). although several reports have established
the involvement of nf-␬b, ap-1, and stat in the induction of
inos in human cells (29, 32, 33), the role of c/ebp␤ in the
induction of human inos has not been established. overexpression of dominant-negative molecules provides an effective
tool with which to investigate the in vivo functions of different
transcription factors and signaling molecules. therefore, we
used the dominant-negative mutant of c/ebp␤ (⌬c/ebp␤) (34)
to inhibit the activation of c/ebp␤. it is apparent from fig. 8
that the expression of ⌬c/ebp␤ but not that of the empty
vector inhibited inos promoter-driven luciferase activity significantly (p ⬍ 0.005) in cytokine-stimulated human u373mg
astroglial cells, suggesting the involvement of c/ebp␤ in the
induction of inos in human astroglial cells.
since gemfibrozil inhibited cytokine-induced activation of
human inos promoter (fig. 5), we decided to investigate the
effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these proinflammatory
transcription factors in cytokine-stimulated human u373mg

discussion

the signaling events transduced by proinflammatory cytokines for the induction of inos are poorly understood. a complete understanding of the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in the induction of inos should identify novel targets
for the therapeutic intervention in no-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases. the studies reported in this manuscript
clearly demonstrates that gemfibrozil, an activator of ppar-␣,
reduces the induction of inos in human astrocytes. since
astrocytes express ppar-␣ (35), and no produced from inos
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of demyelinating and
neurodegenerative diseases (5–7), our results provide a potentially important mechanism whereby activators of ppar-␣

from fig. 9, a–d, that the combination of il-1␤ and ifn-␥
induced nf-␬b-, ap-1-, and c/ebp␤-dependent luciferase activities by 3–5-fold and that of the gas-dependent one by about
10-fold within 6 h of incubation. however, isre-dependent
luciferase activity was not induced in the presence of same
cytokines under the same condition (fig. 9e). the combination
of il-1␤ and ifn-␥ was also unable to induce the activation of
isre within 12 or 18 h of incubation (data not shown). gemfibrozil itself did not induce the activation of any of these
transcription factors (fig. 9). however, this fibrate drug markedly inhibited cytokine-induced activation of nf-␬b, ap-1, and
c/ebp␤ (fig. 9, a–c). this inhibitory effect was dose-dependent, and the maximum inhibition was found at 150 –200 ␮m
concentration of gemfibrozil. however, activation of c/ebp␤
was much more sensitive than that of nf-␬b and ap-1 to
gemfibrozil (fig. 9). in contrast, gemfibrozil had no inhibitory
effect on gas-dependent luciferase activities in cytokine-stimulated u373mg astroglial cells (fig. 9d). at 150 or 200 ␮m
gemfibrozil, only 10 –12% inhibition of gas-dependent luciferase activity was observed. similar to the effect of ⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ on
the inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil on the induction of inos,
⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ was also unable to reverse the inhibitory effect of
gemfibrozil on cytokine-induced activation of nf-␬b, ap-1, and
c/ebp␤ (data not shown).
effect of gemfibrozil on cell viability—human u373mg
astrocytoma cells were incubated with different concentrations
(50, 100, 150, and 200 ␮m) of gemfibrozil under serum-free
condition as mentioned above, and their viability was determined by the mtt assay. gemfibrozil used at different concentrations did not decrease the viability of the cells (data not
shown). therefore, inhibition of the expression of inos by
gemfibrozil was not due to any change in viability of the cells.

may ameliorate neural injury. however, gemfibrozil inhibits
the induction of inos in human astroglial cells independent of
ppar-␣. this conclusion is based on the following observations. first, gemfibrozil induced ppre-dependent luciferase
activity, suggesting that gemfibrozil can activate ppar in human astroglial cells. second, gemfibrozil inhibited cytokineinduced activation of inos promoter suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits the transcription of inos. third, the expression of
⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣, a dominant-negative mutant of human ppar-␣,
blocked gemfibrozil-mediated activation of ppre suggesting

c/ebp␤ translational product, lip, which acts as a dominantnegative inhibitor of c/ebp␤ activity (34), inhibits the production of no and the expression of inos in mouse microglial cells
(4). consistently, here we show that ⌬c/ebp␤ also inhibits
cytokine-induced activation of inos promoter in human astroglial cells (fig. 8).
here we have found that the combination of il-1␤ and ifn-␥
markedly induced the activation of nf-␬b, ap-1, c/ebp␤, and
gas but not that of isre in human u373mg astroglial cells.
interestingly, gemfibrozil suppressed cytokine-induced activation of nf-␬b, ap-1, and c/ebp␤ but not that of gas. since
stat binds to gas (40) and jak is known to phosphorylate
and activate stat (40), our results suggest that gemfibrozil
may not inhibit the jak-stat pathway in human astrocytes.
on the other hand, irf-1 binds to isre (41). irf-1 has been
found to be involved in the induction of inos by ifn-␥ in
mouse macrophages (42). consistently, ifn-␥ cannot induce
inos in macrophages isolated from irf-1(⫺/⫺) mice (43). although the promoter of human inos gene contains isre (30,
31, 44), the combination of il-1␤ and ifn-␥ did not modulate
the activation of isre in any significant way, suggesting that
irf-1 is unlikely to act as an important regulator of cytokineinduced expression of inos in human astrocytes.
fibrate drugs like gemfibrozil,  xxxd1724xxx , and  xxxd2096xxx 
induce the proliferation of peroxisomes in rats and mice (45,
46). continuous administration of fibrate drugs to the rats and
mice for 40 –50 weeks also leads to the formation of hepatic
tumor (45– 47). however, induction of hepatic tumor promotion
by fibrate drugs has not been demonstrated in human, other
primates, and guinea pig (46, 48), species that have lost their
ability to synthesize ascorbate due to inherent loss of the gulonolactone oxidase gene. braun et al. (48) have recently reported that the evolutionary loss of the gulonolactone oxidase
gene may contribute to the missing carcinogenic effect of peroxisome proliferators in humans, since ascorbate synthesis is
accompanied by h2o2 production, and consequently its induction can be potentially harmful. furthermore, recent studies
have also revealed that humans have considerably lower levels
of ppar-␣ in liver than rodents, and this difference may, in
part, explain the species differences in the carcinogenic response to peroxisome proliferators (46). in addition, gemfibrozil
does not require ppar-␣ to inhibit the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors and the induction of inos in human astroglial cells. taken together, these observations suggest that gemfibrozil as an anti-neuroinflammatory drug may
not cause human health problems.
no, a short-lived and diffusible free radical, plays many
roles as a signaling and effector molecule in diverse biological
systems; it is a neuronal messenger and is involved in vasodilation as well as in antimicrobial and antitumor activities (49).
on the other hand, no has also been implicated in several cns
disorders, including inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, and
degenerative diseases (5– 8, 50). there is considerable evidence
for the transcriptional induction of inos (the high output
isoform of nos) in the cns that is associated with autoimmune reactions, acute infection, and traumatic brain injury
(5– 8, 50). once no is formed, it spontaneously reacts with o2⫺
to form peroxynitrite (onoo⫺), the most reactive derivative of
no known so far (51). both no and peroxynitrite are potentially toxic molecules to neurons and oligodendrocytes that may
mediate toxicity through the formation of iron-no complexes of
iron-containing enzyme systems (52), oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups (51), nitration of proteins, and nitrosylation of
nucleic acids and dna strand breaks (53).
in the cns, inos is expressed mainly by activated astrocytes and microglia, the two glial cell types involved in intrac-

that gemfibrozil activates ppre through ppar-␣. fourth,
⌬ xxxg1805xxx -␣ was unable to block the inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil on the induction of inos promoter activation, suggesting
that gemfibrozil does not require ppar-␣ to inhibit the induction of inos in human astroglial cells.
in contrast to the marked induction of inos mrna by the
cytokine combination (fig. 2), there was only a 3.9-fold induction of human inos promoter in human astroglial cells (fig. 5),
suggesting that in addition to transcriptional mechanisms
posttranscriptional events could also play a significant role in
regulating the expression of inos gene. several authors have
performed nuclear run-on assays to analyze the induction rate
of the human inos promoter in different human cell lines (30,
36 –38). these authors have shown that the endogenous inos
promoter displays a significant basal activity and that the
induction rate of only 2–10-fold by cytokines is much lower as
seen for the induction of the inos mrna expression. taken
together, these results suggest that human inos gene is regulated at the level of transcription as well as posttranscription.
however, in our experiment, gemfibrozil does not alter the
relative rate of degradation of human inos mrna in astroglial
cells (fig. 3), suggesting that gemfibrozil may not couple to
posttranscriptional pathways required for the regulation of
inos expression and that gemfibrozil inhibits the expression of
inos mrna mainly at the level of transcription.
proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-␣, il-1␤, or ifn-␥) bind to
their respective receptors and induce inos expression via activation of nf-␬b (2– 4, 22, 26 –28). the presence of multiple
consensus sequences in the promoter region of inos for the
binding of nf-␬b and the inhibition of inos expression with
the inhibition of nf-␬b activation (2– 4, 22, 26 –28) establishes
an essential role of nf-␬b activation in the induction of inos.
although tnf-␣ or il-1␤ alone is capable of inducing the
activation of nf-␬b, these cytokines alone were not sufficient
to induce the expression of inos in human cell lines (39). the
fact that a combination of cytokines is required to induce the
expression of inos suggests that activation of additional transcription factors is also necessary for the expression of inos.
consistently, apart from the consensus sequence for binding of
nf-␬b, the human inos promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors including ap-1,
c/ebp␤, irf-1 binding to isre, and stat binding to gas
(29 –31). the bulk of the work regarding the involvement of
these transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of
the inos gene involved the murine system.
although the role of these transcription factors in the transcription of human inos has not been well established, several
evidences point to their possible involvement in the induction
of inos in human cells. kleinert et al. (32) have shown that the
cytokine mixture induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of
 xxxg1220xxx  in human dld-1 cells. this activated  xxxg1220xxx  further
induces the dna binding activity of stat1␣ (32). tyrophostin
b42, a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1220xxx  (33), inhibits the phosphorylation of  xxxg1220xxx , the activation of stat1␣, and the induction of
inos (32), suggesting that the  xxxg1220xxx -stat1␣ pathway is an
important activator of inos transcription. moss and colleagues
(29) have recently shown that activation of both nf-␬b and
ap-1 is an important step for the transcription of inos in
human cells. mutation in nf-␬b- as well as ap-1-binding site
of the inos promoter reduces the transcriptional activity of
inos promoter (29). furthermore, they (29) have shown that
map kinase pathways (erk and p38) regulate the expression
of inos in human lung epithelial (a549) cells through the
modulation of nf-␬b and ap-1. recently, we have found that
activation of c/ebp␤ is also necessary for the induction of
inos (4). overexpression of ⌬c/ebp␤, a truncated alternate

gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of nos in human astrocytes
erebral immune regulation. astrocytes are the major glial cell
population in the central nervous system; therefore, induction
of inos in astrocytes may be an important source of no in
cns inflammatory disorders associated with neuronal and oligodendrocytes death. therefore, gemfibrozil being capable of
attenuating the activation of proinflammatory transcription
factors and the expression of inos in human astrocytes may
find therapeutic application in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.
