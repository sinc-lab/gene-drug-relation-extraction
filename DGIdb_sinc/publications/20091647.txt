abstract
background
vitamin d is produced in the skin after sun-light exposure and can also be obtained through food. vitamin d deficiency has recently
been linked with a range of diseases including chronic pain. observational and circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a
role for vitamin d deficiency in the aetiology of chronic pain conditions.
objectives
to assess the efficacy and adverse events of vitamin d supplementation in chronic painful conditions.
search methods
we searched cochrane central, medline, embase and the oxford pain relief database for studies to september 2009. this
was supplemented by searching the reference lists of retrieved articles, textbooks and reviews.
selection criteria
studies were included if they were randomised double blind trials of vitamin d supplementation compared with placebo or with active
comparators for the treatment of chronic pain conditions in adults.
data collection and analysis
two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. pooled analysis
was not undertaken due to paucity and heterogeneity of data.
main results
four studies, with a total of 294 participants, were included. the studies were heterogeneous with regard to study quality, the chronic
painful conditions that were investigated, and the outcome measures reported. only one study reported a beneficial effect, the others
found no benefit of vitamin d over placebo in treating chronic pain.

authors’ conclusions
the evidence base for the use of vitamin d for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. this is due to low quality and insufficient
randomised controlled trials in this area of research.

plain language summary
vitamin d for the treatment of chronic painful conditions in adults
vitamin d has a variety of roles in the body. it is made in the skin through the action of sunlight and can also be obtained from food.
a lack of vitamin d has been implicated in a number of diseases, including chronic painful conditions. additionally, associations of
such diverse types of pain as headache, abdominal pain, knee pain, and back pain with season of the year and latitude provide indirect
support for a role for vitamin d. the possibility of a link between vitamin d and chronic pain has attracted interest because - if it
was true - vitamin d would be a cheap and relatively safe treatment for chronic pain. there is some evidence supporting this link
but it is not of high quality and is at risk of bias. this review sought out high quality evidence from randomised controlled trials
on the treatment of chronic pain with vitamin d. there were few high quality studies of which only one reported a beneficial effect.
at present, therefore, there is insufficient evidence for an effect of vitamin d in chronic pain conditions. more research is needed to
determine if vitamin d is a useful pain treatment at all and if so, whether the effect is restricted to those who are vitamin d deficient,
how much vitamin d is useful, in which conditions, and for how long.

background
vitamin d is a fat-soluble vitamin that is synthesized from a precursor in the skin after exposure to ultraviolet b (uvb) radiation
from the sun, and it is also obtained from dietary sources (e.g.
oily fish, vitamin d-fortified milk and breakfast cereals, or dietary
supplements). vitamin d can be of plant origin ( xxxd2019xxx  or
 xxxd2019xxx ) or of animal origin ( xxxd1682xxx  or cholecalciferol).
vitamin d from the skin and diet is metabolized in the liver to
25-hydroxy vitamin d, and further metabolized in the kidneys to
its active form, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin d. vitamin d exerts its
effects by modulating gene expression after binding to a nuclear
 xxxg2412xxx . most tissues in the human body express vitamin d receptors (holick 2007) supporting the concept of a wideranging importance of vitamin d.
vitamin d deficiency can arise from a number of causes including
insufficient uvb exposure, decreased bioavailability (e.g. malabsorption disorders), or diseases that affect the metabolism of vitamin d, such as liver and kidney disease. some medications can
also cause vitamin d deficiency. these include anticonvulsants,
glucocorticoids, and antiretroviral drugs (holick 2007).
vitamin d is known to be implicated in diseases of the musculoskeletal system, where its deficiency is classically a cause of rickets
(in children) and osteomalacia (’softening of the bones’, in adults).
recently insufficient vitamin d has been implicated in a range of
diseases involving other body systems, including disorders such

as metabolic, autoimmune, psychiatric and cardiovascular disease,
cancers (especially colon, prostate, and breast cancer), and chronic
pain (holick 2007). it has been suggested that there is widespread
vitamin d deficiency in the population and that sensible sun exposure and vitamin d supplementation may be called for (holick
2007). indeed, a recent meta-analysis found a reduced all-causemortality (death rate from any cause) with vitamin d supplementation (autier 2007). recommended levels of vitamin d intake
vary from 200 international units (iu) to 1000 iu per day (holick
2007). one iu corresponds to 25 ng of vitamin d.

description of the condition
chronic pain is generally described as pain experienced on most
days for at least three months. chronic pain in its various forms
is very common, one of the most common health problems of all.
the prevalence of benign chronic back pain in adults alone has
been estimated to be between 2% and 40%, depending on the
population studied (verhaak 1998). the prevalence of arthritis was
estimated at almost 16% in a large multinational study (alonso
2004). fibromyalgia is another chronic pain disorder that affects
1 to 2% of the population (bannwarth 2009; mas 2008; mcquay
2007). furthermore, acute pain can become chronic. for example,
a systematic review showed that chronic pain after surgery was
surprisingly common, up to 47% after thoracic surgery (perkins
2000). a survey of adults from scotland found that about half of

them self-reported chronic pain (elliott 1999). not surprisingly,
chronic pain conditions can have a profound effect on functioning
and quality of life (alonso 2004; mas 2008), with considerable
economic and social impact. chronic pain is a very common cause
of sickness absence from work (saastamoinen 2009).
there is some controversy among the experts as to which levels
of 25-hydroxy vitamin d actually constitute deficiency (holick
2007), but low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin d have been linked
with a higher incidence of chronic pain (atherton 2009; benson
2006; lotfi 2007). additionally, associations of such diverse types
of pain as headache, abdominal pain, knee pain, and back pain
with season of the year and latitude may be taken as evidence to
suggest that 25-hydroxy vitamin d levels are important in this
context (mitsikostas 1996; saps 2008; zeng 2004). it seems possible, therefore, that vitamin d deficiency is involved in the aetiology of chronic pain.

description of the intervention
vitamin d supplementation can be given orally or parenterally. a
number of different preparations and dosing regimens of vitamin
d treatment have been employed in clinical practice. this review
will consider all vitamin d preparations or dosing regimens when
used in the treatment of chronic pain. treatment with vitamin
d holds great appeal because it is cheap, has relatively few, and
usually mild, side effects, and there is a positive public perception
of vitamin supplementation which could result in high rates of adherence. excessive vitamin d intake can result in hypercalcaemia,
but this is rare.

how the intervention might work
vitamin d supplementation increases 25-hydroxy vitamin d
blood levels (holick 2007) (25-hydroxy vitamin d is the form
of the vitamin usually measured, with assays normally detecting
 xxxd2019xxx  and  xxxd1682xxx  ) and can therefore potentially correct
the effects of vitamin d deficiency. the details of how this might
work (molecular mechanism, time to effect, extent of reversibility of pain associated with vitamin d deficiency) are unclear at
present.

why it is important to do this review
while low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin d have been linked with
chronic pain conditions, no systematic review of vitamin d supplementation in chronic pain has been published in the cochrane
database of systematic reviews. a systematic review of vitamin d
treatment for chronic pain is necessary to answer the questions of
whether chronic pain can be helped by vitamin d supplementation and, indirectly, whether low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin d
in people with chronic pain are causal or coincidental. our earlier

review on this topic was published in “pain”. this was based on
a medline (pubmed) search and used evidence from a variety
of study architectures (straube 2009). we felt it was important to
develop this further by using a more extensive search strategy and
at the same time more stringent inclusion criteria to focus on the
high quality evidence that is most relevant to clinical practice and
present such a review in the cochrane library.

objectives
to assess the efficacy and adverse events of vitamin d supplementation in chronic pain conditions when tested against placebo or
against active comparators.

methods

criteria for considering studies for this review

types of studies
studies were included if they were randomised double blind
controlled trials of vitamin d supplementation compared with
placebo or with active interventions in the treatment of chronic
pain conditions. randomisation and double blinding are known
to minimise bias (moore 2006). parallel group design and crossover studies were both acceptable.
we excluded the following:
• review articles, case series, case reports and clinical
observations;
• studies of experimentally induced pain;
• studies where pain relief (or pain intensity with baseline
level) was not measured or not patient-reported.

types of participants
studies of adult participants (> 15 years) with all types of chronic
pain conditions were eligible for inclusion. to qualify for inclusion, all study participants needed to have a chronic painful condition. studies in conditions that were painful in some but could
be asymptomatic in others (e.g. osteoporosis) did not qualify for
inclusion if they did not explicitly state that all study participants
had chronic pain.

types of interventions
vitamin d supplementation (oral or parenteral) compared with
placebo or active comparator. no restriction was made regarding

type, dose and frequency of vitamin d treatment. studies that investigated combined treatment with vitamin d and other concurrent interventions were included only if the other interventions
were available to the comparator group also, because we wanted
to isolate the treatment effect due to vitamin d.

types of outcome measures
we collected data on participant characteristics (age, sex, and condition to be treated, baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin d status) together with the following:
• patient reported pain intensity or pain relief;
• patient reported global impression of change;
• patient reported “improvement ” in pain;
• patient reported quality of life;
• adverse events;
• withdrawals.
because different painful conditions may respond to vitamin d
after different time periods (leavitt 2008), we extracted outcome
measures at different time points. we also collected data on baseline and end of trial 25-hydroxy vitamin d levels where they were
reported.

primary outcomes

the primary outcome was clinically significant pain relief. the
following hierarchy of outcome measures, in order of preference,
was used:
• number of participants with at least 50% pain relief;
• number of participants reporting a global impression of
change of “much” or “very much” improvement;
• number of participants with undefined “improvement” in
pain.

electronic searches
the following electronic databases were searched. we searched as
far back as databases allowed us, without specified start dates.
• cochrane central (issue 3, 2009);
• medline (to september 2009);
• embase (to september 2009);
• oxford pain relief database (jadad 1996a).
see appendix 1 for the medline search strategy, appendix 2 for
the embase search strategy and appendix 3 for the central
search strategy.

searching other resources
additional studies were sought from the reference lists of retrieved
articles, textbooks and reviews. manufacturers of vitamin d preparations were not contacted since vitamin d does not have an indication in chronic pain.

data collection and analysis
review authors were not blinded to the authors’ names and institutions, journal of publication, or study results at any stage of
the review. two review authors independently selected the studies
for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data.
disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third review author.

selection of studies
titles and abstracts of publications identified by the searches were
assessed on screen to eliminate studies that obviously did not satisfy
the inclusion criteria. full publications of the remaining studies
were obtained to determine inclusion in the review.

secondary outcomes

we investigated these secondary outcomes:
• other patient-rated pain outcomes (reported as
dichotomous responder outcomes or group mean values);
• numbers of participants with adverse events: any adverse
event, serious adverse events;
• numbers of withdrawals: all cause, lack of efficacy, and
adverse event withdrawals;
• number of participants reporting improvement in quality of
life (any scale).

search methods for identification of studies
studies were identified primarily by searching electronic databases,
with no language restriction.

data extraction and management
a standard form was used for data extraction.

assessment of risk of bias in included studies
two review authors independently assessed the included studies
for quality using a five-point scale (jadad 1996b) that considered
randomisation, blinding, study withdrawals and dropouts. studies
needed to score at least two points, one for randomisation and one
for blinding to be included in the review, i.e. studies needed to be
randomised and double blind. trial validity was assessed using a
16-point scale (smith 2000) and a risk of bias table was completed
using the criteria of sequence generation, allocation concealment
and blinding.

measures of treatment effect

sensitivity analysis

it was planned to estimate treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes by calculating relative benefit or harm, and numbersneeded-to-treat-to-benefit (nnt) or -harm ( xxxd669xxx ). any continuous outcome data would be analysed using revman 5.

sensitivity analyses were planned for different treatment regimens
and for participants with different baseline levels of 25-hydroxy
vitamin d (the effects of vitamin d treatment might differ in
people who are deficient in 25-hydroxy vitamin d versus those
who have ’normal’ levels).

unit of analysis issues
randomisation was to the individual patient.

results

dealing with missing data

description of studies

analysis was conducted according to the intention-to-treat (itt)
principle.

see: characteristics of included studies; characteristics of excluded
studies.

assessment of heterogeneity
it was planned to examine homogeneity of studies with regard to
intervention effects visually using l’abbé plots (l’abbé 1987).

results of the search
searching identified 15 potentially relevant studies that were examined for inclusion.
included studies

assessment of reporting biases
reporting biases were not formally assessed.

data synthesis
it was planned to pool either dichotomous and continuous data
where the same or comparable measures were used. data for ’at
least 50% pain relief ’ would be combined even when pain was
assessed with different scales whenever the assessments in themselves were valid.
for dichotomous outcomes, relative benefit (rb) and risk (rr)
estimates would be calculated with 95% confidence intervals (ci)
using a fixed-effect model (morris 1995). a statistically significant
benefit of active treatment over control would be assumed when
the lower limit of the 95% ci of the rb was greater than the
number one. a statistically significant benefit of control over active
treatment was assumed when the upper limit of the 95% ci was
less than the number one. nnt or  xxxd669xxx  and 95% ci would be
calculated from the pooled number of events using the method
devised by cook and sackett (cook 1995).
continuous data suitable for pooling would be analysed using
revman 5 software.

subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
subgroup analyses were planned for different pain conditions.

four studies were included (brohult 1973; di munno 1989;
warner 2008; yamauchi 1989) with a total of 294 participants.
full details are in the “characteristics of included studies” table.
excluded studies
eleven potentially relevant studies (arden 2006; björkman 2008;
de nijs 2006; dottori 1982; grove 1981; krocker 2008; lyritis
1994; ringe 2000; ringe 2004; ringe 2005; ringe 2007) had to
be excluded largely for reasons of methodological inadequacy (not
double blind) or because it was not clear that all participants had
a chronic painful condition. full details are in the “characteristics
of excluded studies” table.

risk of bias in included studies
one recent study (warner 2008) was of high methodological
quality (oxford quality score 5/5) suggesting little likelihood
of methodological bias. three older studies (brohult 1973; di
munno 1989; yamauchi 1989) had lower oxford quality scores
and were potentially prone to bias. points were lost mainly due
to failure to adequately describe methods of randomisation and
blinding. studies scored between 9/16 and 16/16 on the oxford
pain validity scale, indicating moderate to good validity. points
were lost due to inadequate details of study methods and because
of small trial group sizes.
full details are in the table of “characteristics of included studies”
and figure 1.

effects of interventions
four studies could be included (brohult 1973; di munno 1989;
warner 2008; yamauchi 1989) with a total of 294 participants.
these studies investigated the effects of four different regimens
of vitamin d administration, in participants with three different
chronic pain conditions, from four different countries, were conducted at different times, and reported on different outcomes. the
studies were therefore not sufficiently homogeneous to allow any
meaningful pooled analysis.
only one of the included studies investigated one of the primary
efficacy outcomes that were selected as representing clinically sig-

nificant benefit. a trial of  xxxd109xxx  ( xxxd109xxx )
for rheumatoid arthritis over 16 weeks (yamauchi 1989) found
that similar proportions of participants reported “very much” or
“much” improvement in patient global impression of change in
the two treatment groups (1-2 µg  xxxd109xxx ) and in the placebo
group.
in a trial of 100,000 iu daily  xxxd2019xxx  for rheumatoid arthritis
conducted over 12 months, brohult 1973 showed that the consumption of analgesics and antiinflammatory medicines decreased
significantly in the  xxxd2019xxx  group while there was no change in
the placebo group (no direct between groups comparison was re-

ported). a trial of 25-hydroxy vitamin d (35 µg per day for 25
days a month) in participants with polymyalgia rheumatica over
9 months (di munno 1989) found that subjective pain on movement decreased in both vitamin d and placebo groups over time,
with little difference between the groups (no statistics for between
group comparisons reported). a recent study of 50,000 iu  xxxd2019xxx  for the treatment of diffuse musculoskeletal pain over 3
months (warner 2008) investigated pain with a visual analogue
scale (vas) - finding no significant difference between vitamin d
and placebo groups - and with a functional pain score - with an
outcome that slightly favoured placebo in one comparison (table
1).
warner 2008 measured 25-hydroxy vitamin d levels in treatment
and placebo groups at the start and end of the trial (the only study
to do so). while at baseline there was no significant difference in
25-hydroxy vitamin d levels between groups, after three months
of  xxxd2019xxx  treatment the levels in the active treatment group
were significantly higher than in the placebo group (table 1).
two studies, with a total of 195 participants, reported on adverse
events in a way that allowed data extraction (numbers of participants with any adverse events or serious adverse events). adverse
events were infrequent and occurred at similar rates with vitamin
d and placebo (di munno 1989; yamauchi 1989; table 2).
brohult 1973 reported that after 10 months of treatment one
participant in the  xxxd2019xxx  group had a serum calcium level (7.0
meq/l) that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range, and
that two participants in the  xxxd2019xxx  group reported polydipsia
and increased frequency of urination on one occasion (these can
be symptoms of hypercalcaemia, but they are not specific for it).
none of the other trials reported on hypercalcaemia as an adverse
event.
withdrawals were investigated in three studies with a total of 270
participants. there were similar rates of withdrawals in the vitamin d and placebo groups. brohult 1973 reported that four out
of 24 participants withdrew in the  xxxd2019xxx  group (three due to
worsening of disease, one death due to a pulmonary embolus) versus six out of 25 in the placebo group (all due to worsening of
disease). yamauchi 1989 found that 8/57 participants withdrew
in the placebo group, 14/59 in the 1 µg  xxxd109xxx  group, and 9/
55 in the 2 µg  xxxd109xxx  group. of these, only one withdrawal
was due to lack of efficacy (1 µg  xxxd109xxx  group); adverse event
withdrawals included three cases in the placebo group, one case in
the 1 µg  xxxd109xxx  group and two cases in the 2 µg  xxxd109xxx 
group. warner 2008 stated that three out of 25 participants withdrew in the vitamin d group versus five out of 25 in the placebo
group; there were no adverse event withdrawals in either group
(table 2).
no study reported on the number of participants with improvements in quality of life.

discussion

summary of main results
on the basis of four heterogeneous studies there is at present
no convincing evidence that vitamin d treatment is beneficial in
chronic painful conditions in adults. only one of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes that this review was looking for, finding similar results with vitamin d and placebo. these
primary outcomes were based on a recent description of clinically
useful benefit (dworkin 2008). with one exception (yamauchi
1989) the studies reported only group means, rather than dichotomous responder outcomes (such as the proportions of participants
achieving a certain defined level of pain intensity or pain relief ).
relying on group mean values for pain intensity or pain relief is
problematic because the underlying distributions are often skewed,
and using average data from such skewed distributions can produce misleading results (mcquay 1996). this is why dichotomous
responder analysis has been suggested to produce results more useful in clinical practice both in the acute (moore 1998) and chronic
pain setting (moore 2008).
the only study that reported a beneficial effect (in a secondary pain
outcome and not reporting dichotomous responder outcomes) was
of lower methodological quality (brohult 1973). the three other
studies found no benefit of vitamin d over placebo (di munno
1989; warner 2008; yamauchi 1989).

overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
a number of potentially eligible studies had severe methodological
limitations and had to be excluded from this review. of the four
studies that could be included, three were of lower methodological
quality (brohult 1973; di munno 1989; yamauchi 1989) and
therefore potentially prone to bias. only one studies investigated
one of the primary pain outcomes that were chosen for clinical
relevance and applicability (yamauchi 1989). furthermore, the
clinical heterogeneity between studies made a meaningful pooled
analysis impossible.

quality of the evidence
the paucity of trials and participants in stringent studies, together
with the laxness and inadequacy of outcome measures used, implies that the evidence base for the use of vitamin d in chronic
painful conditions is weak.

potential biases in the review process
because of adherence to quality criteria and an extensive search
strategy, bias in the review process were minimised.

agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
this study agrees with a previous review on the subject in that
there is little high quality evidence for an effect of vitamin d in
chronic pain, despite the existence of a number of studies of lower
methodological quality (not double blind randomised controlled
trials (rcts)) that suggest an effect (straube 2009). as we have
previously stated, there is a ’beguiling attraction’ in a link between low 25-hydroxy vitamin d levels and chronic pain (straube
2009). if effective, vitamin d would be a simple and inexpensive treatment with limited side effects. good evidence for this
effectiveness is lacking, however. there are a number of examples
where early observational studies and treatment studies of lower
methodological quality appear to demonstrate effects that are not
subsequently confirmed by high quality trials. for example, the
use of hyperbaric oxygen in multiple sclerosis appeared beneficial
based on observational and non-randomised studies, but subsequent rcts found no benefit (bennett 2001). likewise for the
use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for postoperative pain, non-randomised trials were largely positive while randomised trials were largely negative (carroll 1996). our previous
review on vitamin d for chronic pain came to a similar conclusion
when comparing high and low quality treatment studies (straube
2009). this present review - relying on a wider search and more
strict inclusion criteria than our previous review - found few trials
of a methodological quality sufficient for inclusion and with one
exception these did not report on the most informative outcomes.

implications for research
there is clearly a need for more work in this area. an effect of
vitamin d on chronic pain is theoretically possible, even in the
absence of a clear mode of action, because of the wide range of
effects of vitamin d (holick 2007) and the many molecular and
neural mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of various chronic
pain conditions. while there is little evidence from double blind
rcts, other study types do suggest that there may be a link (
straube 2009). because vitamin d is cheap and relatively safe, a
use in chronic pain could be advocated even if the benefit was of
modest size.
more and better evidence is called for. what is needed are large,
double blind, rcts in a variety of chronic pain conditions conducted over long enough periods of time with multiple assessments
to capture short, medium, and long term effects. to provide the
highest quality evidence, these trials need to be stratified by baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin d levels, with defined treatments, with
clinically relevant pain outcomes (such as the primary outcomes
that this review looked for), and ideally with outcomes analysed by
post-treatment 25-hydroxy vitamin d level. because it is unclear
whether vitamin d has an effect at all, trials need to include a
placebo group; and because it is unclear which dose of vitamin d
- if any - is effective, different treatment regimens need to be compared. finally, trials need to report on adverse events (including
hypercalcaemia) and give details of withdrawals and drop-outs (all
cause, lack of efficacy, and adverse event withdrawals), as is now
commonly done in the pain field.

authors’ conclusions
acknowledgements
implications for practice
at present, the evidence base for the use of vitamin d supplementation for chronic painful conditions in adults is rather poor
and we do not think the evidence is of sufficient quality to guide
clinical practice.

yamauchi 1989 included 191 participants in total (65, 64, and 62 in the placebo, 1 µg, and 2 µg  xxxd109xxx  groups, respectively).
of these, 20 (8, 5, and 7 in the previously mentioned groups) were excluded after randomisation due to violation of inclusion criteria
or concurrent drugs. these 20 participants who were excluded from the original study due to protocol violation were not included in
our intention to treat analysis.

differences between protocol and review
after the search and examination of the retrieved studies it was decided to include an additional secondary outcome (“other patientrated pain outcomes”).
since the included studies were both clinically and methodologically heterogeneous, no pooled analysis was possible, no formal
assessment of heterogeneity was undertaken, and no sensitivity analyses were undertaken. it had been planned to assess efficacy at
different time points but there were insufficient data to do this.
