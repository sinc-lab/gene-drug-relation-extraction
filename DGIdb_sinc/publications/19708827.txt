10. expert opinion

 xxxd282xxx  is the newer 5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) prodrug which releases
active  xxxd2579xxx  only into the colon with minimal systemic absorption. the onset
of action of this drug is variable, and it may take at least some days to reach
clinical effectiveness. clinical studies found  xxxd282xxx  faster than  xxxd2579xxx 
in the induction of remission, but  xxxd282xxx  has no benefit compared with
 xxxd2579xxx  in preventing relapse in the population selected. however, the
high number of pills to take may affect the adherence to the treatment.
this  xxxd2579xxx  prodrug may be effectively used also in patients unable to tolerate
other  xxxd2579xxx  compounds for non-hypersensitivity reasons. the costs of
 xxxd282xxx  capsules seem to be lower for the health system, both considering
total direct healthcare costs and better outcomes, compared with patients
treated with oral  xxxd2579xxx . finally, there is also some recent evidence
that  xxxd282xxx  may be effectively used, in combination with probiotics, in
treating acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is the colon.

introduction

treatment with 5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) containing drugs is the gold standard
in treating mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis (uc) [1]. slow-release drug
formulations are increasingly available for the treatment of uc and have been
developed to target  xxxd2579xxx  delivery to the colon. these formulations are divided into
two categories: those using a delayed-release mechanism achieved by a ph shift or
sustained-release formulations, and those using azo-bonded prodrug forms.
delayed-release formulations may be at a risk of early increased absorption of
 xxxd2579xxx , leading to possible  xxxd2579xxx -nephrotoxicity [2]. in contrast to delayedrelease  xxxd2579xxx  formulations, the azo-bonded containing drugs are patterned
on the original  xxxd2579xxx -containing drug,  xxxd3255xxx .  xxxd282xxx , the newer  xxxd2579xxx 
prodrug, provides more rapid relief of symptoms and induces complete remission in
a greater percentage of patients than ph-dependent, delayed-release  xxxd2579xxx  [3].
it has been effectively used in treating uc [4], and in combination with a highpotency probiotic preparation, vsl#3, in inducing and maintaining remission of active
mild-to-moderate uc and acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis of the colon [4].
the rationale and the clinical data in using this drug are described herein.

mechanism of action of  xxxd2579xxx 

 xxxd2579xxx  is absorbed into the epithelium of the distal ileum and/or colon, where
it undergoes extensive metabolism to n-acetyl-5-amyiosalicylate (n-ac- xxxd2579xxx )
by n-acetyl-transferase 1. from the ileal and/or colonic epithelium, n-ac- xxxd2579xxx 
is both secreted back into the lumen by the membrane-bound drug efflux

 xxxd282xxx  in treating colonic diseases

pump, p-glycoprotein, and excreted in faeces, and adsorbed
systematically into the blood and excreted in the urine [5].
the systemic adsorption is very low and similar for all
 xxxd2579xxx  formulations, whereas systemic adsorption of
 xxxd2579xxx  prodrugs is somewhat (but not statistically significant) lower [5]. in examining the main pharmacokinetic
parameters (tmax, cmax, auc), we find that the values are
similar for all  xxxd2579xxx  formulations [5].
the exact mechanisms of action responsible for the efficacy
of the  xxxd2579xxx  compounds are not yet well understood.
it is thought that  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits some key factors of the
inflammatory cascade (cyclooxygenase, thromboxane synthetase
and paf synthetase), inhibits the production of il-1 and free
radicals [6-8], and possesses intrinsic antioxidant activity [9], the
reduction of transcriptional activity of  xxxg1559xxx , the inhibition
of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis [10].
recent data suggest that  xxxd2579xxx  acts at least in large part
through the activation of the  xxxg1807xxx  nuclear receptors. these
receptors are expressed at high levels in colonic epithelial
cells, where their expression appears to be at least in part
stimulated by the gut bacteria [11].  xxxg1807xxx  is involved in the
control of inflammation, cell proliferation, apoptosis and
metabolic functions [10]. recent data identifying  xxxg1807xxx  as
the key receptor for  xxxd2579xxx  have been based on functional,
pharmacological and chemical lines of evidence [12].

chemistry, pharmacokinetic and metabolism
of  xxxd282xxx 
3.

 xxxd282xxx  has the chemical name (e)-5-[[-4[[2-carboxyethyl) amino]carbonyl]phenil]azo]-2-hydroxybenzoic
acid, disodium salt dehydrate.
it is an orally administered prodrug of  xxxd2579xxx  in which
an inert carrier molecule, 4-aminoenzoil-beta-alanine, is bonded
to a molecule of  xxxd2579xxx  [13]. after administration, colonic
 xxxg1592xxx  produced by colonic bacteria [14] splits  xxxd282xxx  into  xxxd2579xxx  and 4-aminobenzoil-beta-alanine, releasing active  xxxd2579xxx  only into the colon with minimal systemic
absorption [13].
 xxxd282xxx  is excreted as a metabolite primarily in the
faeces (65% as  xxxd2579xxx  or metabolites) and urine (25% as n- xxxg69xxx -asa); less than 1% of the parent drug is found in the urine
or faeces.
this azo-bonded drug should, therefore, provide a more
reproducible and reliable delivery of  xxxd2579xxx  to the colon,
resulting in a more rapid improvement of symptoms and
induction of remission. the onset of action of this drug is
variable, and it may take at least some days to reach
clinical effectiveness.

clinical efficacy in treating active
ulcerative colitis
4.

the clinical efficacy of  xxxd282xxx  in treating uc has been
proven by several trials.
1556

4.1

 xxxd282xxx  compared to  xxxd3255xxx 

green et al. performed a double-blind, parallel group
study over 12 weeks comparing  xxxd282xxx , 6.75 g daily, with
 xxxd3255xxx , 3 g daily, in the treatment of active uc of all
grades of severity. a total of 57 patients were randomised:
28 to receive  xxxd282xxx  and 29 to receive  xxxd3255xxx . there
was a trend towards more patients completing the study in
remission on  xxxd282xxx  than on  xxxd3255xxx  (75 versus 59%),
but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). significantly
fewer patients withdrew from the  xxxd282xxx  group due to
adverse events (2/28 versus 9/29, p = 0.041) [15].
mansfield et al. compared the safety and efficacy of
 xxxd3255xxx , 3 g, with  xxxd282xxx , 6.75 g, in the initial daily
treatment of mild-to-moderate uc through a randomised,
double-blind, parallel group study, with a treatment duration
of 8 weeks. a total of 50 patients were recruited (26 treated
with  xxxd282xxx  and 24 with  xxxd3255xxx ). more patients
withdrew due to adverse events in the  xxxd3255xxx  group
(nine patients versus one patient in the  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd282xxx  groups, respectively, p = 0.004). remission occurred
in both groups ( xxxd282xxx : 50%;  xxxd3255xxx : 38%, p = ns).
improvement in the  xxxd282xxx  treatment group was significant at 2 weeks (p = 0.011), 4 weeks (p = 0.011) and at the
end of treatment (p < 0.001), whilst, in the  xxxd3255xxx  group,
it was not significant until week 4 (p = 0.03), indicating a
faster improvement for  xxxd282xxx  [16].
these data show that  xxxd282xxx  has a similar eradication
rate than  xxxd3255xxx , but it is better tolerated than  xxxd3255xxx . as shown by a recent meta-analysis, overall tolerability was significantly lower for  xxxd282xxx  compared with
 xxxd3255xxx , but clear  xxxd282xxx  superiority compared to
 xxxd3255xxx  does not seem convincing [17].
4.2

 xxxd282xxx  compared to  xxxd2579xxx 

green et al. performed a randomised, double-blind
study comparing  xxxd282xxx , 6.75 g/daily, with  xxxd2579xxx ,
2.4 g/daily, administered for 12 weeks to 101 patients with
symptomatic, endoscopically proven uc. symptomatic remission was obtained in a great percentage of patients taking
 xxxd282xxx  at weeks 2, 4 and 12. additionally, complete remission was obtained in higher percentage of patients taking
 xxxd282xxx  than  xxxd2579xxx  after 4 (38 versus 12%, p = 0.005)
and 12 (62 versus 37%, p = 0.0159) weeks.  xxxd282xxx  was also
faster in obtaining remission than  xxxd2579xxx  (10 versus 2%
at 2 weeks, p = 0.0446). also, the side effects recorded
were significantly less in the  xxxd282xxx  group (48 versus 71%,
p = 0.024) [18].
another large study was performed by levine et al. one
hundred and fifty-four patients with active, mild-to-moderate
uc, as verified by sigmoidoscopy, were enrolled. the patients
were treated with  xxxd282xxx  6.75 g,  xxxd282xxx  2.25 g or
 xxxd2579xxx  2.4 g. eight weeks of treatment with 6.75 g of
 xxxd282xxx  daily provided significantly greater improvement
than did  xxxd282xxx  (2.25 g daily) in rectal bleeding (64.7%
(6.75 g  xxxd282xxx ) versus 32.4% (2.25 g  xxxd282xxx ),

p < 0.006), stool frequency (58.8 versus 29.4%, p < 0.006),
sigmoidoscopic score (78.9 versus 52.5%, p < 0.015) and
physicianâs global assessment (73.7 versus 51.3%, p < 0.03).
the efficacy of  xxxd282xxx  showed a significantly more rapid
onset of action than that of  xxxd2579xxx  (2.4 g daily) (2-week
sigmoidocopic score improvement, 54.7% (6.75 g  xxxd282xxx )
versus 29.4% (2.4 g  xxxd2579xxx ), p = 0.006) with numerically
greater improvement at 8 weeks in five of seven measured
signs and symptoms.  xxxd282xxx  (6.75 g daily) was well tolerated, and the safety profile did not differ significantly
from that of  xxxd282xxx  (2.25 g daily) or  xxxd2579xxx  [19].
the larger study has been conducted by pruitt et al. they
enrolled 173 patients with endoscopically proven uc in an
8-week, double-blind, randomised treatment with  xxxd282xxx 
6.75 g/day or  xxxd2579xxx  2.4 g/day. this trial did not find any
different efficacy in inducing remission (46% in  xxxd282xxx 
group versus 44% in  xxxd2579xxx  group), but it found an
earlier remission in obtaining remission in the  xxxd282xxx 
group (25 versus 37 days) [20].
a newer, larger study was performed also by scherl et al.
in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new twice-daily
 xxxd282xxx  1.1 g tablet dosing regimen (6.6 g/day,
three tablets twice daily) in treating mild-to-moderatelyactive uc. in a double-blind, multi-centre study, a total of
249 patients (166  xxxd282xxx , 83 placebo) with symptoms of
active uc were randomised to receive 3.3 g of  xxxd282xxx  or
placebo tablets twice daily for 8 weeks. a significantly larger
proportion of patients achieved clinical improvement and
improvement in rectal bleeding in the  xxxd282xxx  versus the
placebo group (55 versus 40%, p = 0.02). the most common
adverse events reported were worsening of uc and headache,
which were reported more often in the placebo group. this
new formulation with a reduced pill and dosing burden
offers, therefore, the potential to improve convenience and
compliance in patients with active uc [21].
4.3

 xxxd282xxx  in combination with probiotics

there is evidence implicating the resident bacterial flora as an
essential factor in driving the inflammation process in human
inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). probiotics are living microorganisms that, on ingestion in certain numbers, exert health
benefits beyond those of inherited basic nutrition [22].
probiotics seem to inhibit pathogen adherence, increase iga
secretion in peyerâs patches, increase the immune system
activity inhibiting the release of anti-inflammatory cytokine and
inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine [23]. moreover, these
âgoodâ bacteria may interfere with the pathogen metabolism
by a mechanism of âmetabolic competitionâ [23].
this new approach seems to be also a further option in
treating uc [24,25], as well as it seems to be effective in
managing pouchitis [26].
vsl#3, a probiotic mixture, contains a significantly greater
concentration of live bacteria (at least 3 Ã 1011 viable cells/g)
than traditional probiotic preparations. it contains four
strains of lactobacillus (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus

and l. delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus), three strains of
bifidobacterium (b. longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and
one strain of streptococcus salivarius (subspecies thermophilus).
although the precise mechanism of action of vsl#3 is not
fully understood at present, preclinical and clinical studies have
shown that vsl#3 modulates the host immune response [27].
in 2004, a randomised study assessed the effectiveness of the
 xxxd282xxx âvsl#3 combination in treating mild-to-moderate
uc [28]. ninety patients (thirty for each group) were randomly
enrolled, with a treatment duration of 8 weeks:  xxxd282xxx 
2.25 g/day plus vsl#3 450 billion/day (group a),  xxxd282xxx 
alone 4.5 g/day (group b) or  xxxd2579xxx  2.4 g/day (group c).
efficacy was assessed by symptoms assessment, endoscopic
appearance and histological evaluation.
 xxxd282xxx âvsl#3 was significantly superior to  xxxd282xxx 
alone or  xxxd2579xxx  in obtaining remission: 24 patients of
group a were in remission (per-protocol: 85.71% (ci95%:
62 â 96), on intention-to-treat: 80% (ci95%: 59 â 91)),
while 21 group b (per-protocol: 80.77% (ci 95%: 51 â 82),
on intention-to-treat: 77% (ci95%: 43 â 81)) and 16 group c
patients were in remission (per-protocol: 72.73% (ci 95%:
30 â 75), on intention-to-treat: 53.33% (ci95%: 42 â 62))
(p < 0.02).  xxxd282xxx  with or without vsl#3 was more
tolerated than  xxxd2579xxx , and the  xxxd282xxx âvsl#3 combination was faster to obtain remission than  xxxd282xxx  alone
or  xxxd2579xxx  (4, 7.5 and 13 days in groups a, b and c.
respectively) [28].
the  xxxd282xxx âvsl#3 combination seems to act by two
different ways to stop inflammation:  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits some
key factors of inflammatory cascade (e.g., cyclooxygenase,
thromboxane-synthetase and paf-synthetase), [7-9,29], while
probiotic (vsl#3 in particular) action includes production
of antimicrobials, competitive metabolic interactions with
pro-inflammatory organisms, and inhibition of adherence and
translocations of pathogens [30].

 xxxd282xxx  in maintaining remission of
ulcerative colitis
5.

 xxxd282xxx  seems to be effective also in maintaining remission.
green et al. performed a randomised, double-blind comparison of  xxxd282xxx  3 g/daily and  xxxd2579xxx  1.2 g/daily
for 12 months, in 99 (95 evaluable) patients in uc remission.  xxxd282xxx  patients experienced more asymptomatic
nights (90 versus 77%, p = 0.0011) and days (58 versus
50%, p = 0.3995) during the first 3 months.  xxxd282xxx 
patients experienced more symptom-free nights a week
(6.4 Â± 1.7 versus 4.7 Â± 2.8; p = 0.0006) and fewer nights a
week with blood on their stools or on the toilet paper, mucus
with their stools or with sleep disturbance resulting from
symptoms or lavatory visits (each p < 0.05). fewer  xxxd282xxx 
patients relapsed within 3 months (10 versus 28%; p = 0.0354).
remission at 12 months was 58%, in both groups. similar
proportions of patients reported adverse events (61  xxxd282xxx 
versus 65%  xxxd2579xxx , p = 0.8330). there were five serious

 xxxd282xxx  in treating colonic diseases

adverse events (two  xxxd282xxx , three  xxxd2579xxx ) and four
withdrawals due to unacceptable adverse events (three  xxxd282xxx , one  xxxd2579xxx ), of which one in each group was
also a serious adverse event [31].
kruis et al. compared the relapse preventing effect and
safety profile of two doses of  xxxd282xxx  and a standard dose
of eudragit coated  xxxd2579xxx  in maintaining remission of
uc. a total of 133 patients with uc in remission were
enrolled in a double-blind, randomised trial: 49 patients
were treated with  xxxd282xxx  1.5 g twice daily, 40 with  xxxd282xxx  3.0 g twice daily and 44 with  xxxd2579xxx  0.5 g three
times daily. the study lasted for 26 weeks.  xxxd282xxx  3.0 g
twice daily showed significantly higher clinical remission
rate (77.5%) than  xxxd282xxx  1.5 g twice daily (43.8%) and
 xxxd2579xxx  0.5 g three times daily (56.8%) (p = 0.006). the
respective times to relapse were 161 days, 131 days (p = 0.003)
and 144 days (p = ns). accordingly, pair-wise contrasts of the
final endoscopic score demonstrated a significant difference
(p = 0.005) between the two  xxxd282xxx  treatment groups
while differences between either of these two groups and
 xxxd2579xxx  were not statistically significant (p = 0.133). three
 xxxd282xxx  1.5 g twice daily group patients, two  xxxd282xxx 
3.0 g twice daily group patients and four  xxxd2579xxx  0.5 g
three times daily group patients were withdrawn from the trial
because of adverse effects. high dose  xxxd282xxx  (3.0 g twice
daily) was superior in maintaining remission in patients with
uc compared with a low dose (1.5 g twice daily) or a standard dose of  xxxd2579xxx  (0.5 g three times daily). all three
treatments investigated were also safe and well tolerated [32].
a more recent 3-year, two-cohort, multi-centre study
assessed the efficacy of a patient-led dosing using  xxxd282xxx .
a total of 128 patients in remission from active uc were
enrolled: one cohort was in stable remission (52 patients) and
the other was newly in remission (76 patients). two 750 mg
 xxxd282xxx  capsules were given twice daily for maintenance,
increased by 750 mg increments to a maximum of 6 g for up
to 7 days depending on symptom severity. clinical assessments
were made every 12 â 14 weeks. the average median daily dose
of  xxxd282xxx  was 3 g (range, 1.5 â 6 g). in the cohort with
stable remission, 23 (44%) patients had relapsed by 3 years
(median time to relapse > 1095 days (36 months)). in the
cohort newly in remission, these values were 45 (59%) patients
and 656 days (22 months), respectively. in the cohort with stable
remission, the time since last relapse was significantly associated
with relapse during the first year of treatment (p < 0.033).
these data confirm that long-term, patient-led, maintenance
treatment with  xxxd282xxx  is well tolerated with a good safety
profile and is effective for patients affected by uc [33].
6.

use of  xxxd282xxx  in other colonic diseases

6.1

diverticular disease

recent observations suggest an understanding of the natural
history of diverticular disease as a chronic ibd [29]. because
it is now accepted that low-fibre diets may be associated
1558

with diverticular formation, it must be noted that low-fibre
diets results in an altered microecology. experimentally in
humans, it was demonstrated that wheat bran alters anaerobic/
aerobic bacterial ratios [34], and that altering the flora will
change the immune response of the host and the colon [35,36].
there is also evidence that chronic inflammation occurs in
the mucosa associated with diverticula and that it may be
identified also by faecal calprotectin [37].
these new pathophysiologic understandings about diverticular disease may also explain some recent literature data about
new therapeutic approaches to the disease. if chronic inflammation occurs as a result of alteration in the normal microflora, it is probable that altering the flora or administering
anti-inflammatory agents may help to treat diverticular disease,
to prevent diverticulitis or to reduce diverticulitis recurrence.
a recent, pilot-study study investigated whether low-dose
 xxxd282xxx  plus vsl#3 or vsl#3 alone were effective in
preventing diverticulitis recurrence [38]. thirty patients were
monitored in this study after obtaining remission. the patients
were randomly treated with  xxxd282xxx  2.25 g daily for 10 days
every month plus vsl#3 450 billions/day for 15 days every
month (group a) or with vsl#3 alone 450 billions/day for
15 days every month (group b). eleven group a patients
were completely symptom-free (73.33%) after 12 months,
whilst two patients complained for only mild, recurrent
symptoms (13%). one (6.66%) patient showed relapse of
symptoms during the follow-up. eight (60%) group b patients
were completely symptom-free after 12 months, two (13.33%)
patients complained of mild, recurrent symptoms and one
(6.66%) patient complained of mild but continuous symptoms. two (13.33%) patients showed relapse of the disease
during the follow-up. the probioticâ xxxd282xxx  combination
was found to be better, therefore, than probiotic treatment
in preventing relapse of uncomplicated diverticulitis of the
colon, even if not statistically significant (p < 0.1). the
mechanisms of action of this combination on inflammation
is similar to that of ibd:  xxxd2579xxx  downregulates the inflammatory cascade by inhibition of several pro-inflammatory
factors, whilst probiotics maintain an adequate and balanced
colonisation in gastrointestinal tract inhibiting both colonic
bacterial overgrowth and metabolism of pathogens as well as
perhaps reducing some pro-inflammatory cytokines [39]. this
approach seems to be able to maintain an optimal colonic
micro-environment, and seems to be able in maintaining
most of these patients disease-free.
6.2

radiation-induced proctosigmoiditis

treatment with  xxxd282xxx  was effective also in preventing
acute radiation-induced proctosigmoiditis (rips). a common
complication of pelvic radiotherapy (rt) is the development
of acute rips, for which a multitude of therapies have been
tried.  xxxd2579xxx  has been tested, but it fails in limiting or
preventing rips [40]. a small randomised, placebo-controlled
trial was performed in 2005 that evaluated  xxxd282xxx  for its
potential to prevent or limit rips in patients undergoing

rt for carcinoma of the prostate, as a representative sample
of pelvic rt patients [41]. twenty-seven eligible patients,
affected by prostate cancer, american joint committee on
cancer stage t1-3, m0 being treated with external beam
rt, were enrolled. patients took 2.25 g of  xxxd282xxx  or an
identical-appearing placebo twice daily beginning 5 days
before rt and continuing for 2 weeks after completion.
toxicities were graded weekly according to national cancer
institute common toxicity criteria v. 2.0 for each of the
following: proctitis, diarrhoea, dysuria, weight loss, fatigue,
nausea and vomiting. a symptom index was formulated for
each toxicity consisting of the toxicityâs numeric grade multiplied by the number of days it was experienced, and summed
for each grade experienced throughout the course of rt. with
the exception of nausea or vomiting, seen in three patients
on  xxxd282xxx  and two on placebo, all toxicities were appreciably
lower in patients taking  xxxd282xxx . proctitis was prevented
most significantly with a mean proctitis index of 35.3 in
 xxxd282xxx  patients and 74.1 in placebo patients (p = 0.04).
placebo patients lost an average of 2.7 pounds, whereas
 xxxd282xxx  patients on average gained weight.
7.

safety and tolerability

suplhasalazine may cause several side effects that are multifactorial in aetiology, some due to the parent molecule, and
some to one of its two metabolites,  xxxd2579xxx  and sulfapyridine. a prospective study found that the clinical tolerance to
 xxxd2579xxx  (63%),  xxxd2781xxx  (70%) and  xxxd282xxx  (70%) is
similar, and that these  xxxd2579xxx  formulations may be effectively
used in patients intolerant to  xxxd3255xxx  [42].
the newer  xxxd2579xxx  preparations are generally well tolerated
and have fewer side effects than  xxxd3255xxx . although
 xxxd282xxx  has a similar side effect profile to other  xxxd2579xxx 
preparations, some available data show that patients taking
 xxxd282xxx  experience fewer side effects than patients taking
other  xxxd2579xxx  preparations [33].
fever, cutaneous rash and diarrhoea are the most common
side effects. diarrhoea caused by  xxxd2579xxx  newer preparation
occurs more frequently in patients taking  xxxd2781xxx  than
 xxxd282xxx ; it is more common at the onset of the treatment
and typically resolves within some weeks as the colon adapts
to the increased fluid load [43].
hypersensitivity reactions to the 5-asas can result in
pancreatitis and pneumonitis. patients with known hypersensitivity to any member of this class of medication should
not be started on another, as these responses are likely to occur
again [44,45]. looking at  xxxd282xxx , it should be avoided in
patients with known hypersensitivity reaction to salicylates,
 xxxd2579xxx , other  xxxd282xxx  metabolites or the components of
the  xxxd282xxx  capsule (silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate)
but may be tolerated in patients who were unable to tolerate
other  xxxd2579xxx  compounds for non-hypersensitivity
reasons [46]. in fact, a recent case report found that adverse
reactions to one or more  xxxd2579xxx  medications ( xxxd2579xxx  as

either ph-dependant release or time-dependant release) do not
necessarily preclude the use of others in the same class, and
that a successful challenge with  xxxd282xxx  can be effected [47].
although uncommon, development of acute interstitial
nephritis has been described in patients taking  xxxd2579xxx ,
with an incidence of 1:500 [48]. early stopping of  xxxd2579xxx 
has been associated with reversibility of this process, but
prolonged treatment may lead to irreversible renal impairment [45,48]. data about this type of side effect in patients
taking  xxxd282xxx  are unavailable. however, because the active
 xxxd2579xxx  coming from  xxxd282xxx  is released only into the colon
with minimal systemic absorption, it is hypothesised that
this azo-bonded  xxxd2579xxx  prodrug may be at a lower risk of
developing this type of renal complication.
overall,  xxxd282xxx  is well tolerated and effective in the
treatment of ibd, but casual complication cannot be overall
avoided. for example, a recent case report described a case of
a 38-year-old man with uc recently treated with  xxxd282xxx 
admitted with chest pain. investigations demonstrated acute
myocarditis, which resulted in a full recovery and resolution of
abnormalities when  xxxd282xxx  therapy was withdrawn [49].
we cannot forget that  xxxd2579xxx  drugs are commonly used for
the management of ibd also during pregnancy. the safety
of drug therapy for ibd during pregnancy is an important
clinical concern. a recent meta-analysis explored the risk of
adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ibd following
exposure to  xxxd2579xxx  drugs ( xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd3255xxx ,  xxxd282xxx 
and  xxxd2781xxx ). a total of 2200 pregnant women with ibd
were included and data analysed (642 patients receiving  xxxd2579xxx 
drugs and 1158 not receiving any medication). the results
found a 1.16-fold increase for congenital abnormalities (95%
ci: 0.76 â 1.77, p = 0.57), a 2.38-fold increase for stillbirth
(95% ci: 0.65 â 8.72, p = 0.32), a 1.14-fold increase for
spontaneous abortion (95% ci: 0.65 â 2.01, p = 0.74), a
1.35-fold increase for preterm delivery (95% ci: 0.85 â 2.13,
p = 0.26) and a 0.93-fold increase for low birth weight
(95% ci: 0.46 â 1.85, p = 0.96). although this meta-analysis
is limited by lack of information regarding the dose of
 xxxd2579xxx  given, it confirms that  xxxd2579xxx  compounds are thought
to be safe in pregnancy, and as such, classified as pregnancy
risk class b [50].
finally,  xxxd282xxx  can be used also in paediatric patients.
a recent document from the fda extended the indication
from adults to patients 5 years and older suffering from mildly
to moderately active uc. in these patients, pharmacokinetic
of  xxxd282xxx  and its metabolites shows very large interpatient variability, similar to that seen in adults. dosing can be
initiated at either 6.75 or (preferably) 2.25 g/day, and adverse
events were similar to those seen in adults [51].

costs

uc is a costly disease, especially if not properly treated.
epidemiologic studies have shown that many patients progress
in 1 year from initial treatment with prednisone to expensive

 xxxd282xxx  in treating colonic diseases

colectomy if the uc is not managed with drug therapy. a
two-stage decision analysis was conducted to estimate the
cost of a  xxxd2579xxx  treatment failure using the treatment guidelines recommended by the american college of gastroenterology
and to incorporate the cost of a  xxxd2579xxx  treatment failure to
determine which oral  xxxd2579xxx  agent results in cost minimisation and cost effectiveness. healthcare costs related to uc
for an oral  xxxd2579xxx  failure is greater than $ 11,500 on average
in the first 6 months after therapy. patients treated with
 xxxd282xxx  capsules had 16% lower total direct healthcare
costs, 32% better outcomes (days without symptoms or steroids) and 37% greater cost effectiveness compared with patients
treated with a specific formulation of oral  xxxd2579xxx . this
important point should be considered to avoid the cost and
morbidity associated with  xxxd2579xxx  treatment failures [52].

conclusions

 xxxd282xxx  is the newer  xxxd2579xxx  prodrug that can be effectively
used in treating uc.  xxxd282xxx  is more effective than
 xxxd2579xxx  in the induction of remission, but  xxxd282xxx  has
no benefit compared with  xxxd2579xxx  in preventing relapse
in the population selected. although the number of patients
with any adverse events and withdrawals because of severe
adverse events is similar for  xxxd2579xxx  and  xxxd282xxx  [53],
this  xxxd2579xxx  prodrug may be effectively used also in patients
unable to tolerate other  xxxd2579xxx  compounds for nonhypersensitivity reasons. the costs of  xxxd282xxx  capsules seem
to be lower for the health system, considering total direct
healthcare costs, better outcomes and better cost-effectiveness
compared with patients treated with oral  xxxd2579xxx . finally,
there is also some recent evidence that  xxxd282xxx  may be
effectively used, in combination with probiotics, in treating
acute uncomplicated diverticulitis in the colon.

expert opinion

 xxxd282xxx  is the newer  xxxd2579xxx  prodrug which seems to be
effective in treating active uc. currently, three points seem
to be of interest in using this drug:
1. although the current data are still conflictive, some studies
found  xxxd282xxx  more effective that  xxxd2579xxx  in inducing
remission of active mild-to-moderate uc. these studies
show conflicting results also due to differences in the remission definitions used by the different studies (endoscopic,
and/or symptomatic remission or assessment by clinical
indexes). the results are, therefore, difficult to compare.
further studies should be performed to confirm or deny
this result, also considering that the largest induction trial
by pruitt et al. did not find a difference in the 8-week
remission rates [20]
2.  xxxd282xxx  seems to be faster in obtaining remission than
 xxxd2579xxx ; however, it is not clear that the onset of action
has a major influence on patient adherence [54] and
1560

3.  xxxd282xxx  may be effectively used also in patients
unable to tolerate other  xxxd2579xxx  compounds for
non-hypersensitivity reasons.
on the other hand, balsalzide does not seem better than
 xxxd2579xxx  in maintaining remission. despite this, and despite
some adverse events related to the  xxxd2579xxx  reactivity,  xxxd282xxx 
may be, therefore, an effective tool in treating active uc.
however, some clinical aspects should be further investigated
in the future.
â¢ the better  xxxd282xxx  dosage to obtain remission is 6.75 g
(9 capsules/day or 6 tablets/day as suggested by scherl et al. [21]).
because the  xxxd2579xxx  dosage to obtaining remission ranges
from 2.4 to 3.2 g/day (3 â 4 pills/day), it is evident that the
higher number of  xxxd282xxx  capsules in comparison to
lower number of  xxxd2579xxx  pills to obtain remission may
affect patientsâ compliance in  xxxd282xxx -treated patients.
patientsâ adherence to the treatment is an important point
that affects patients treated with  xxxd2579xxx  [55]. it should be
interesting to compare the patientsâ compliance when
treated with  xxxd282xxx  with compliance when treated with
the new, once daily  xxxd2579xxx  formulations (mmx,  xxxd2579xxx 
or  xxxd2579xxx  granules). in particular,  xxxd2579xxx  with mmx
multi matrix system technology (also known as mmx
 xxxd2579xxx ) has been introduced in the treatment of uc.
this is an oral, high-strength (1.2 g/tablet), once-daily formulation of  xxxd2579xxx . this new formulation has been designed
to provide delayed and prolonged  xxxd2579xxx  release throughout
the colon, and it has been found effective both in inducing
and in maintaining remission of uc [56]. because this once
daily  xxxd2579xxx  formulation partly acts through improved
compliance, further studies should explore whether lower a
amount of  xxxd282xxx  (as investigated by scherl et al. [21])
may obtain the same remission and maintenance rate and
the same patientsâ adherence as  xxxd2579xxx .
â¢ further studies are needed to assess whether lower dosages of
 xxxd282xxx  may be effective at least in maintaining remission
â¢ most of trials compared standard dose of  xxxd282xxx 
(6.75 g/day) with a medium dose of  xxxd2579xxx  (2.4 g/day).
this seems to be the better comparison, because  xxxd282xxx 
6.75 g contains 2.36 g of  xxxd2579xxx  (the standard dose of comparison is 2.4 g of  xxxd2579xxx ). however, a more interesting
comparison could be with higher dose of  xxxd2579xxx  (3.2 or
4.8 g/day). unfortunately, there are no trials comparing  xxxd282xxx  6.75 g/day to  xxxd2579xxx  3.2 or 4.8 g/day in any clinical
scenario including induction of remission in uc, and further
studies should be performed in the future to assess this point
â¢ the colonic-release mechanisms of  xxxd282xxx  may be useful
also in treating colonic crohnâs disease. however, there are
no trials assessing the role of  xxxd282xxx  also in treating
active mild-to-moderate colonic crohnâs disease, and further
studies are needed to investigate the use of  xxxd282xxx  also
in this disease

low-dosage of balasalzide plus high-potency probiotic

tursi

mixture (vsl#3) to be more effective than a medium-dosage
of  xxxd282xxx  or a standard dosage of  xxxd2579xxx  in obtaining
remission of active uc [28]. this is an extremely interesting
approach to treating uc. we currently know that probiotic
action includes several anti-pathogen mechanisms (production of antimicrobials, competitive metabolic interactions
with pro-inflammatory organisms, and inhibition of adherence and translocations of pathogens), as well as that it
enhances immune activity. adding probiotics to an antiinflammatory drug may, therefore, enhance the effect of the
treatment, permitting to reduce the number of capsules
taken to obtain remission. it is interesting to assess whether
this combined approach may be useful also in maintaining
remission of uc, and further studies are warranted
â¢ another interesting clinical application of  xxxd282xxx  is the
treatment of diverticular disease. recent observations suggest
that diverticular disease may be considered as a chronic
ibd [29].  xxxd2579xxx  has been the first  xxxd2579xxx  compound
investigated in the treatment of diverticular disease [29].
the combination probiotic mixture vsl#3â xxxd282xxx  was
found better than probiotic treatment in preventing relapse
of uncomplicated diverticulitis of the colon, even if not
statistically significant (p < 0.1) [38]. the mechanisms of

action of this combination on inflammation are similar to
that of ibd:  xxxd2579xxx  downregulates the inflammatory cascade
by inhibition of several pro-inflammatory factors, whilst
probiotics maintain an adequate and balanced colonisation
in the colon. because a preliminary, double-blind, placebocontrolled study found  xxxd2579xxx  better than placebo in
treating patients suffering from painful diverticular disease [57],
further studies should investigate whether  xxxd282xxx  may
play a therapeutic role also in treating these patients and
â¢ a paper published in 2006 found  xxxd282xxx  more costeffective than  xxxd2579xxx  (lower costs, better outcomes considered as days without symptoms or without steroids) [52].
however, these considerations seem to be still preliminary
and not fully shared, because results as already discussed
previously are inconclusive. more data and adequate evidence
are needed before advising the use of  xxxd282xxx  instead of
 xxxd2579xxx  due to more efficacy and lower costs.
