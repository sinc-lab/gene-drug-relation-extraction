 xxxd3564xxx ,  xxxd3262xxx , and topiramate, clinically
used antiepileptics are inhibitors of mammalian
carbonic anhydrase isoforms i–xiv, indiscriminately inhibiting with variable efficacy all the catalytically active isoforms present in mammals.
however, it is not clear which carbonic anhydrase
isozymes might be responsible for the anticonvulsant activity of such sulfonamide ⁄ sulfamate
drugs. we examine here the full inhibition profile
against all mammalian carbonic anhydrases of the
above antiepileptic drugs together with two investigational, structurally related sulfonamides, one
of which is and the other is not an anticonvulsant.
no clear-cut data allow us to propose which are
the carbonic anhydrases involved in these processes, but strong  xxxg293xxx , vii, ix,
and xii inhibition, correlated with sufficiently high
liposolubility may lead to effective anticonvulsants of this pharmacological class. therefore,
further studies are warranted for better understanding these phenomena. whether the inhibition
of such carbonic anhydrases present in the
mammalian brain might be relevant for designing
pharmacological agents useful in the management
of neurological disorders or for understanding the
multifactorial mechanism of action of some of
these drugs is a topic which surely deserves
further investigations.

the carbonic anhydrases (cas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes, present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, being encoded by
five distinct, evolutionarily unrelated gene families: the a-, b-, c-,

d-, and f-cas (1,2). they all catalyze a very simple but fundamental
physiological reaction, the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to
bicarbonate and protons (1,2). as this reaction is involved in a host
of physiological processes, it is not a surprise that in mammals,
including our own species, 15 or 16 different a-ca isozymes were
described, with very different catalytic activity, subcellular localization, tissue distribution, physiological ⁄ pathological roles, and susceptibility to inhibitors (1,2). basically, there are five cytosolic forms
(ca i-iii, ca vii and ca xiii), five membrane-bound isozymes (ca iv,
ca ix, ca xii, ca xiv and ca xv), two mitochondrial ones (ca va
and ca vb), a secreted ca isozyme, ca vi as well as three acatalytic ones, ca viii, x and xi, denominated also ca-related proteins
(carps) (1,2). ca xv is not present in primates but is found in other
vertebrates, such as rodents, birds, and fish (3). by catalyzing the
interconversion between carbon dioxide and the bicarbonate ion,
these different isoforms are involved in crucial physiological processes connected with respiration and transport of co2 ⁄ bicarbonate
between metabolizing tissues and lungs, ph and co2 homeostasis,
electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues ⁄ organs, biosynthetic
reactions (e.g., gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and ureagenesis), bone
resorption, calcification, tumorigenicity, epileptogenesis, tumorigenesis, and many other physiological or pathological processes
(1,2,4,5).

 xxxd3564xxx  and other
sulfonamides / sulfamates as carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors
the main classes of ca inhibitors (cais) are constituted by the
metal complexing anions (such as cynaide, azide, thiocyanate, etc),
and the unsubstituted sulfonamides and their isosteres (e.g., sulfamates, sulfamides, etc), which bind to the zn(ii) ion of the enzyme
either by substituting the non-protein zinc ligand or add to the
metal co-ordination sphere (1,2). sulfonamides, sulfamates, and sulfamides always bind in this last mode (1,2,6). there are at least 25
clinically used drugs ⁄ agents in clinical development reported to
possess significant ca inhibitory properties (1,2), with at least three
of them being used as antiepileptic drugs:  xxxd3564xxx  1,  xxxd3262xxx 
2, (both sulfonamide derivatives) and topiramate 3 (a sulfamate
derivative), as shown in figure 1.
because of the presence of the zinc binding group of the sulfonamide (so2nh2) ⁄ sulfamate (oso2nh2) type in drugs 1–3, we have
investigated the interaction of these three compounds with all
the catalytically active ca isoforms described so far in mammals
(ca i–xiv) by means of kinetic (solution) and x-ray crystallographic

techniques. as observed from data of table 1, the three compounds
bind to all ca isoforms from mammals (human or mouse cas
were used) but with very different efficacy:  xxxd3564xxx  1 for
example is an efficient ca va and ca ix inhibitor (inhibition
constants of 5.1–20 nm) is slightly less effective as a ca ii and i
inhibitor (inhibition constant of 35–56 nm) whereas its affinity
for other isoforms is less strong (inhibition constants of
89–2.2 · 106 nm, table 1).

in a recent paper, it was erroneously claimed (7) that we have
shown  xxxd3564xxx  (6) to act as 'a highly selective ca ii inhibitor'
and that 'ca ii inhibition may be a potent antiepileptic mechanism,'
citing again another of our papers dealing with the design of anticonvulsant sulfonamides, such as derivatives 4 and 5 shown in
figure 1 (8). we have never stated either one of these two issues
erroneously attributed to us. as seen from data of table 1,  xxxd3564xxx , similarly to  xxxd3262xxx  2 and topiramate 3 are not at all
selective ca ii inhibitors. furthermore, the conclusion of ilies et al.
(8) (in which the drug design of adamantyl-substituted sulfonamides
was reported) was that ca ii inhibition alone is not at all a potent
mechanism for designing effective anticonvulsants, as compounds
such as 4 and 5 possessing very similar ca ii inhibition constants
(of 10–13 nm) and liposolubilities, have very different anticonvulsant
effects in mice (4 at 30 mg ⁄ kg confers protection to 92% of animals, being a potent anticonvulsant, whereas 5 at the same dosage
provides protection to only 47% of the animals, being a rather
weak anticonvulsant agent) (8). it should be mentioned that in the
previous work (8) only the ca i and ii inhibition data of sulfonamides 4 and 5 were published as other isoforms were not readily
accesible at that date. here, we present the full inhibition profile
of these two sulfonamides (4 and 5) and compare them with those
of the clinically used antiepileptics 1–3 to try to understand which
cas are involved in the anticonvulsant action of these drugs ⁄ investigational agents.

antiepileptic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

tion bound to the classical 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide ring present in acetazolamide, shows effective inhibition of isozymes hca iv,
va, vb, vi, and mca xiii (with ki-s in the range of 34–78 nm) and
very effective inhibition of isozymes hca ii, vii, ix, xii, and xiv, with
inhibition constants in the range of 0.5–13 nm. the best inhibited
isozymes were hca vii and ix (subnanomolar inhibition). compound
5, structurally related to 4 (it has an extra nh group in the urea
functionality, as compared with the carboxamide 4) has a different
inhibition profile. it is a medium potency hca va inhibitor (ki of
135 nm), effectively inhibits hca ii, iv, vb, vi, xiii, and xiv (ki-s in
the range of 13–45 nm) and acts as an extremely potent inhibitor
of hca vii, ix, and xii (ki-s in the range of 1.3–7.8 nm). thus, even
a very small structural change leads to a completely different
inhibition profile and biological activity of the two sulfonamides 4
and 5 (the former being an efficient anticonvulsant and the latter
being completely devoid of such properties) (8). thus, these data
(table 1) do not allow us to propose which ca isozyme(s) is
targeted by the anticonvulsant sulfonamides ⁄ sulfamates, although a
clear-cut connection between ca inhibition and the anticonvulsant
effect exists.

as shown recently (9) several types of cells located in the central
nervous system (cns) express many of these ca isoforms. ca ii
was first reported to be the only ca isozyme in cns, but recently,
other ca isozymes have been discovered in this organ. localization
of ca isozymes in different parts of the cns is illustrated at
figure 2. ca ii is expressed in the choroid plexus, oligodendrocytes,
myelinated tracts, and astrocytes in the rodent brain (9). ca iii is
present in the rat and human choroid plexus. ca iv was found on
the luminal membranes of cerebral capillaries, and associated with
the blood–brain barrier in the rat and mouse (9). it is also concentrated in layers iii and vi within the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of rats. the mitochondrial isozymes ca va and ca vb were
found to be expressed in rodent nervous tissues, especially in astrocytes and neurons. the brain expression of ca vii and  xxxg300xxx  viii is
similar: a relatively high expression is observed throughout the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. nevertheless, ca vii expression is
highly increased intrapyramidally at around postnatal day 12 (10).
this developmental expression promotes excitatory response evoked
by intense gabaergic activity. the other acatalytic cas (ca x and
xi) are constitutively expressed in the cns (11). isozyme ix is situ-

ated in choroid plexus but it is overexpressed in glioma, ependymoma, and other cerebral tumors (5). similarly to ca ix, ca xii is
also associated with cancer and is characterized by a similar
expression pattern to that of ca ix. nevertheless, high levels of ca
xii mrna were seen in the dentate granule cells, media amygdala,
choroid plexus, and hippocampus. ca xiv is located on the plasma
membrane of some neurons and on axons of both mouse and
human brain (12). ca xv was only detected in the mice brain
(9,12).

formation of the e–i complex. triplicate experiments were performed for each inhibitor concentration, and the average of those
was taken. the uncatalyzed rates were determined in the same
manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. the kinetic
constant kcat and also kcat ⁄ km were obtained by non-linear least
square method using sigma plot. all inhibition constants (ki) were
determined by non-linear regression analysis as reported earlier
(6,13,14).

thus, thçne et al. (7) in addition to misciting or wrongly interpreting the conclusions of two of our papers (6,8), also consider only
ca ii to be present in the hippocampal  xxxg294xxx  neurons that they
investigate in guinea pigs. considering the many isoforms present
in the cns of mammals (as shown above by us, see figure 2), and
the very different inhibition pattern of the antiepileptic sulfonamides ⁄ sulfamates among which also  xxxd3564xxx  (table 1) with
these purified enzymes in vitro, we express profound doubts regarding the validity of the data and conclusions presented by these
authors (7).

acknowledgments

underscoring the link between cas and epilepsy is complicated
because of the widespread expression of many ca isozymes in the
mammalian brain and due to their multiple physiological roles in
this organ. at least ca ii, iv, va, vii, xii, and xiv have been
pointed out for their contribution to generate neuronal excitation
(10,12). the design and development of more isoform-selective ca
inhibitors might improve our knowledge of the functional relevance
of ca isozyme in neurological disorders (9). further studies are warranted for understanding whether the sulfonamides ⁄ sulfamate antiepileptics are indeed targeting some of these isoforms or whether
cas are just off-targets for the design of antiepileptic drugs.

experimental part
chemicals
derivatives 1–3 are commercially available whereas 4 and 5 were
prepared as reported earlier (8). all ca isozymes were recombinant
ones, obtained as reported by this group (6,13,14).

ca inhibition assay
an sx.18mv-r applied photophysics (oxford, uk), stopped-flow
instrument was used for assaying the ca catalyzed co2 hydration
activity (15). phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) was used as
indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with
10 mm hepes (ph 7.5) as buffer, 0.1 m na2so4 (for maintaining the
ionic strength constant), following the ca-catalyzed co2 hydration
reaction for a period of 10–100 seconds. saturated co2 solution in
water at 20 c was used as substrate. the co2 concentration ranged from 1.7 to 17 mm for the determination of the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mm)
were prepared in distilled deionized water with 10–20% (v ⁄ v)
dmso (which is not inhibitory at these concentrations) and dilutions
up to 0.01 nm were performed thereafter with distilled-deionized
water. inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together
for 15 min at room temperature prior to assay, to allow for the
