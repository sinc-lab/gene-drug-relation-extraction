overexpression of  xxxg1222xxx  and constitutive
activation of the  xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) signaling
pathway have been implicated in the leukemic transformation process. however, c-jun expression and the role of the
jnk signaling pathway have not been investigated in
primary acute myeloid leukemia (aml) cells with
frequently observed balanced rearrangements such as
t(8;21). in the present study, we report elevated c-jun
mrna expression in aml patient bone marrow cells with
t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16), and a high correlation in
mrna expression levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun within
t(8;21)-positive aml patient cells. in myeloid u937 cells,
c-jun mrna and protein expression increase upon
inducible expression of  xxxg1996xxx -eto.  xxxg1996xxx -eto transactivates the human c-jun promoter through the proximal
activator protein (ap-1) site by activating the jnk
pathway. overexpression of jnk-inhibitor  xxxg1371xxx  and
chemical jnk inhibitors reduce the transactivation
capacity of  xxxg1996xxx -eto on the c-jun promoter and the
proapoptotic function of  xxxg1996xxx -eto in u937 cells. an
autocrine mechanism involving granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) and  xxxg529xxx  ( xxxg529xxx )
might participate in  xxxg1996xxx -eto mediated jnk-signaling, because  xxxg1996xxx -eto induces g-csf and  xxxg529xxx 
expression, and  xxxg529xxx -neutralizing antibodies reduce
 xxxg1996xxx -eto-induced jnk phosphorylation. these data
suggest a model in which  xxxg1996xxx -eto induces protooncogene c-jun expression via the proximal ap-1 site of
the c-jun promoter in a jnk-dependent manner.

introduction
the nuclear  xxxg1222xxx  encodes for a major
component of the  xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1) transcription factor family comprising the jun, fos and creb/
atf proteins. c-jun homodimerizes or heterodimerizes
with ap-1 family members via the leucine-zipper domain
(halazonetis et al., 1988), and recognizes tpa- or
camp-response elements in promoters. the c-jun
promoter contains two variant ap-1 binding sites, where
the c-jun protein preferentially heterodimerizes with
atf-2 (stein et al., 1992; van dam et al., 1993). the
more proximal ap-1 (pap-1) site is the main site at
which c-jun stimulates its own transcription in a positive
autoregulatory loop (angel et al., 1988). for transcriptional and autoregulatory activity, c-jun requires phosphorylation by the  xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) at serine
63 (ser63) and serine 73 (ser73) within the transactivation domain (pulverer et al., 1991). the jnk signaling
pathway connects c-jun to a variety of extracellular
factors, including growth factors and cytokines. in
response, c-jun regulates crucial biological processes,
such as proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation.
a deregulation of c-jun or jnk can, however, also
promote cellular transformation. besides important
oncogenes like  xxxg1077xxx  (schutte et al., 1989), cot
(chiariello et al., 2000) or met (rodrigues et al., 1997),
leukemic translocations have also been shown to
stimulate tumor promotion and oncogenic transformation by overexpression of c-jun. in the chronic myeloid
leukemia (cml)-associated leukemic translocations
t(9;22) or t(3;21), enhanced ap-1 activity has been
implicated in the leukemic transformation process
(kurokawa et al., 1995; raitano et al., 1995; tanaka
et al., 1995). studies on t(9;22) have revealed that the
resulting bcr-abl fusion gene constitutively activates
the jnk signaling pathway and increases c-jun expression (burgess et al., 1998). enhanced c-jun expression
and jnk activity might also play a role in acute myeloid
leukemia (aml) with frequently observed balanced
rearrangements such as t(8;21). overexpression of the

 xxxg1996xxx -eto fusion gene, resulting from the translocation t(8;21) in ﬁbroblast cells, results in transformation
and has been associated with increased levels of
phosphorylated c-jun and enhanced ap-1 activity
(frank et al., 1999). the pathophysiological importance
of these ﬁndings, however, has not been conﬁrmed in
primary leukemia patient samples on the basis of
increased levels of c-jun expression. furthermore, the
importance of the jnk signaling pathway for aml1eto induced leukemogenesis has not been investigated.
the translocation t(8;21) is associated with about 40%
of aml with fab (french–american–british) subtype
m2 and represents one of the most frequent chromosomal translocations in aml (look, 1997). the resulting
 xxxg1996xxx -eto fusion gene inhibits important myeloid
transcription factors, which might lead to the block in
differentiation (vangala et al., 2003). it has recently been
shown that  xxxg1996xxx -eto might also be responsible for
gain-of-function properties characterizing leukemogenesis (mulloy et al., 2002). expression of  xxxg1996xxx -eto in
primary human cd34 þ stem cells results in a proliferation and survival advantage of leukemic cells, and
thus promotes their expansion (mulloy et al., 2002).
several positively regulated target genes of  xxxg1996xxx -eto
have been identiﬁed, but only a few have been conﬁrmed
in primary t(8;21)-positive cells. furthermore, the
molecular mechanisms behind the gain-of-function
properties of  xxxg1996xxx -eto are still unknown.
in this study, we found that aml patient cells with
the translocations t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16) have
increased expression levels of c-jun. moreover, in
t(8;21)-positive patient cells, there was a correlation in
the mrna expression levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun.
we show that  xxxg1996xxx -eto induces upregulation of  xxxg1222xxx  expression via transactivation of the c-jun promoter,
and mapped the  xxxg1996xxx -eto responsive site to the
proximal ap-1 site. we also demonstrate the importance of the jnk signaling pathway for  xxxg1996xxx -eto
induced c-jun activation and for the biological function
of  xxxg1996xxx -eto. finally, we suggest that an autocrine
loop involving granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
(g-csf) and the  xxxg529xxx  ( xxxg529xxx ) participates in  xxxg1996xxx -eto induced jnk signaling.

high c-jun mrna expression in aml patient cells with
t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16), and correlation in mrna
expression levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun within
t(8;21)-positive aml cells
cml leukemia cells with translocation t(9;22) have
previously been associated with increased c-jun expression levels (burgess et al., 1998). we therefore examined
whether mrna expression levels for c-jun are also
elevated in aml leukemia cells with the most common
cytogenetic abnormalities. microarray analysis (affymetrix) was performed on aml patient samples with
translocation t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), with translocations involving the mixed-lineage-leukemia (mll) gene

high c-jun expression upon  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction in

to investigate whether  xxxg1996xxx -eto could be responsible for the increased c-jun mrna expression levels in
t(8;21)-positive patients samples, we used a u937 cell
line with  xxxg1996xxx -eto under the control of a zincinducible metallothionein promoter (u937z/a-e). we
performed quantitative real-time pcr for c-jun and
 xxxg1996xxx -eto after different time points of  xxxg1996xxx -eto

on chromosome 11q23: t(11q23/mll) or on normal

present study for the expression of human c-jun. we
found that t(8;21)-, t(15;17)- or inv(16)-positive aml
cells and, as previously shown, cml cells with t(9;22)
showed increased expression levels of c-jun mrna and
that the signal difference compared to c-jun mrna
expression in normal bone marrow cells was statistically
signiﬁcant (pp0.05). in contrast, t(11q23/mll)-positive
aml patient cells had basal levels of c-jun expression
(figure 1a). standard errors of the mean (s.e.m.) of c-jun
mrna expression values in t(8;21)-, t(15;17)- or inv(16)positive aml patient samples were about fourfold
higher compared to the ones in normal bone marrow
individuals (figure 1a). in t(8;21)-positive aml patient
cells, we investigated whether the high variation in c-jun
mrna expression levels was a consequence of ﬂuctuating expression levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto. we performed realtime pcr for  xxxg1996xxx -eto (figure 1b) and c-jun
(figure 1c) of 16 t(8;21)-positive patient samples, and
found a 13-fold variation in  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun
mrna expression levels. correlation analysis of the
mean mrna expression levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun
in t(8;21)-positive patient cells revealed a highly signiﬁcant correlation (pp0.01) (figure 1d). these data
indicate that t(8;21)-, t(15;17)- or inv(16)-positive patient
cells contain high mrna expression levels for c-jun, and
that within t(8;21), there is a positive correlation in the
mrna expression levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun.

panel).  xxxg1996xxx -eto expression induced a ﬁvefold
increase in c-jun expression after 6 h of zn2 þ induction,
and c-jun levels remained elevated 16 h after induction
(figure 2a, lower panel). the addition of zn2 þ did not
affect c-jun expression in parental u937 cells (figure 2a,
lower panel).
to investigate whether  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction also
increases c-jun protein levels, western blot experiments
were performed using a tetracycline-regulated aml1eto expressing u937 cell line (u937t/a-e), which
expresses high and tightly controlled levels of aml1eto protein upon tetracycline withdrawal (figure 2b,
upper panel) (burel et al., 2001). in the u937t/a-e cell
line, c-jun protein (39 kda) expression was increased
after 24 h of  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction, and increased up to
21-fold after 72 h of induction (figure 2b, middle panel).
in the u937t control cell line, c-jun protein expression
did not change upon tetracycline-withdrawal (figure 2b,
lower panel). these data indicate that in u937 cells,
 xxxg1996xxx -eto induction increases c-jun mrna and c-jun
protein expression levels.
 xxxg1996xxx -eto enhances the positive autoregulatory activity
of c-jun by transactivating the human c-jun promoter
through the proximal ap-1 site
we next studied whether  xxxg1996xxx -eto upregulated c-jun
expression by stimulating c-jun promoter activity.
furthermore, it was of interest to compare the
transactivating capacity of  xxxg1996xxx -eto with wild-type
 xxxg1996xxx  or eto protein. we transiently transfected u937
cells with the full-length human c-jun promoter (construct #1) and cotransfected  xxxg1996xxx -eto,  xxxg1996xxx  or
eto.  xxxg1996xxx -eto transactivated the full-length c-jun
promoter around threefold, whereas neither wild-type
 xxxg1996xxx , with or without cotransfection of its coactivator
core-binding factor (cbf) b, nor wild-type eto had
transactivation capacity (figure 3b).
in order to map the  xxxg1996xxx -eto transactivation site
in the c-jun promoter, we transiently transfected u937
cells with various 50 c-jun promoter deletion mutants
(wei et al., 1998). in figure 3a, the basal promoter
activity of each promoter construct in u937 cells is
presented in comparison to the basal promoter activity
of the empty vector plasmid  xxxg2041xxx  or pgl2. the site
transactivated by  xxxg1996xxx -eto could be narrowed down
to a region between bp 180/ þ 731 (construct #5)
(about 3.5-fold transactivation) and bp 63/ þ 731
(construct #6) (no transactivation) (figure 3c). in the
longer c-jun promoter constructs (#2–4), transactivation
capacity of  xxxg1996xxx -eto decreased from threefold to
1.5-fold, which implies loss of positive-response elements. in addition, the increase in c-jun activation by
 xxxg1996xxx -eto upon removal of sequence between 345
and 180 suggests the presence of a repressive element
(possibly the distal ap-1 site). the bp 180/ þ 731 c-jun
promoter construct (#5) still contains the proximal ap-1
site (figure 3a). the importance of the ap-1 site for
 xxxg1996xxx -eto transactivation has previously been shown
using a minimal ap-1 promoter derived from the
collagenase gene in ﬁbroblast cells (frank et al., 1999).

for ﬁne mapping, u937 cells were transiently
transfected with a c-jun promoter construct (bp 79/
þ 170) (#7) containing the proximal ap-1 site (pap-1),
or the same construct with a mutated pap-1 site (#8)
(figure 3d). cotransfection of  xxxg1996xxx -eto transactivated the bp 79/ þ 170 c-jun promoter construct up to
4.5-fold, whereas transactivation capacity was reduced
to 1.5-fold when the pap-1 site was mutated. the bp
63/ þ 170 c-jun promoter construct (#9) was not
transactivated by  xxxg1996xxx -eto (figure 3d). this construct was included to rule out a role of the 30 promoter
region between bp þ 170 and bp þ 731. the pap-1 site
is also the site through which c-jun autoregulates its own
expression. we therefore hypothesized that  xxxg1996xxx -eto
enhanced the autoregulatory capacity of c-jun by
increasing c-jun protein levels. we transiently transfected the full-length c-jun promoter (#1), and cotransfected c-jun,  xxxg1996xxx -eto, or c-jun and  xxxg1996xxx -eto
together, into u937 cells, which contain little endogenous c-jun. cotransfection of  xxxg1996xxx -eto increased
transactivation capacity of c-jun from fourfold to 10fold (figure 3e). these results show that  xxxg1996xxx -eto
increased c-jun promoter activity via the proximal ap-1
site and thus enhanced the autoregulatory nature of
c-jun.
 xxxg1996xxx -eto induces the jnk signaling pathway
we investigated how  xxxg1996xxx -eto induced c-jun promoter activity.  xxxg1996xxx -eto could not directly
bind to the c-jun promoter (emsa, data not shown)
and in addition, the c-jun promoter does not
contain any  xxxg1996xxx  consensus sites through which
 xxxg1996xxx -eto has been shown to interact with dna
(meyers et al., 1993). therefore,  xxxg1996xxx -eto might
induce the c-jun promoter via the proximal ap-1 site in
an indirect manner. at the proximal ap-1 site, prebound c-jun is mainly targeted by the jnk signaling
pathway (karin, 1995). we therefore hypothesized that
the jnk signaling pathway might be involved. we
assayed the activity of jnk induced phosphorylation of
ser63 in c-jun in u937t/a-e cells after 48 h of aml1eto induction (u937t/a-e 48 h tet) and found a 3.5fold increase. (figure 4a, lane 4). tetracycline withdrawal did not affect c-jun phosphorylation in u937t
control lysates (u937t 48 h tet) (figure 4a, lanes 1
and 2).
in order to rule out the possibility that kinases other
than jnk phosphorylated ser63 in c-jun, we directly
measured phosphorylation of jnk upon  xxxg1996xxx -eto
induction.  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction for 48 h increased
phosphorylation of the 46 kda isoform of jnk up to
2.3-fold and the 54 kda isoform of jnk up to 6.3-fold
(figure 4b). unphosphorylated  xxxg1370xxx  expression levels
were, however, not enhanced upon  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction (figure 4c). we further analysed the phosphorylation of the endogenous jnk targets c-jun and atf-2
upon  xxxg1996xxx -eto expression, which heterodimerize at
the proximal ap-1 site in u937 cells (data not shown).
 xxxg1996xxx -eto induction also increased jnk-speciﬁc
phosphorylation of ser73 in c-jun up to 2.5-fold and

human c-jun promoter (pcjun) 50 deletion constructs (#1–9). the locations of the proximal ap-1 (pap-1) and distal ap-1 (dap-1) sites
are indicated. the basal promoter activity of each construct is presented in comparison to the empty vector (pgl2 or  xxxg2041xxx ), which is
set to 1. (b) transient transfection of u937 cells with 0.6 mg of the full-length human c-jun promoter (pcjun #1) or the promoterless

phosphorylation of thr71 in atf-2 up to 3.2-fold.
(figure 4d). these results indicate that the jnk
signaling pathway might link the expression of aml1eto with transactivation of the proximal ap-1 site of
the c-jun promoter.
interference with the jnk signaling pathway disrupts the
functional properties of  xxxg1996xxx -eto
in order to elucidate the functional importance of the
jnk signaling pathway for  xxxg1996xxx -eto induced
transactivation of c-jun promoter activity, we investigated whether disruption of the jnk signaling pathway
oncogene

could interfere with the transactivation capacity of
 xxxg1996xxx -eto on the c-jun promoter. for this, u937t/
a-e and u937t control cells, grown with or without
tetracycline, were transiently transfected with the fulllength c-jun promoter construct (#1), and cotransfected
with  xxxg1371xxx  (figure 5a).  xxxg1371xxx , a scaffold protein,
aggregates components of the jnk pathway to form a
functional signaling module (yasuda et al., 1999). in
overexpression studies, however,  xxxg1371xxx  sequesters jnk
from its nuclear targets, and thus functions as an
inhibitor of jnk-regulated gene expression (dickens
et al., 1997). we could show that  xxxg1371xxx  inhibited the
activating effects of c-jun on the c-jun promoter.

(figure 5d). therefore, we overexpressed  xxxg1371xxx  in
u937t/a-e cells after 36 h of  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction
and found that the transactivation capacity of the c-jun
promoter by  xxxg1996xxx -eto was reduced from threefold to
1.7-fold (40%) (figure 5a).
we further assessed whether the inhibition of c-jun
activation could inhibit the biological functions of
 xxxg1996xxx -eto.  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction for 3 days in
u937 cells induces proliferation arrest and apoptosis
(burel et al., 2001). we conﬁrmed the proapoptotic
function of  xxxg1996xxx -eto in these cells by performing
western blot analysis for poly(adp-ribose) polymerase
(parp). parp is a 116 kda protein that is speciﬁcally
cleaved by caspase-3 and caspase-6 into a 85 kda
apoptotic fragment. we found that after 72 h of
 xxxg1996xxx -eto induction, the 116 kda parp protein
was cleaved to a 85 kda apoptotic fragment
(figure 5c).  xxxg166xxx / xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining
revealed that these apoptotic cells are mainly in the
stage of late apoptosis (figure 5b).
we tried to block  xxxg1996xxx -eto induced apoptosis
with cell-permeable jnk inhibitor peptides (jnk inh.).
they contain 20 amino acids of the islet-brain-1 protein,
a mouse homologue of  xxxg1371xxx  (bonny et al., 2001), and
reduced the amount of  xxxg1996xxx -eto induced phosphorylation of ser63 in c-jun by 60% (from 1 to 0.4,
according to densitometric analysis) (figure 5e).
furthermore, they inhibited the autoregulatory activity
of c-jun on the c-jun promoter. (figure 5d). addition of
these peptides to  xxxg1996xxx -eto expressing u937t/a-e
cells reduced  xxxg1996xxx -eto induced apoptosis by 30%,
while addition of a negative control peptide (hiv-tat
alone) had no effect. no effect was seen when u937t/ae cells were grown in the presence of tetracycline or for
the u937t control cell line (figure 5b). these results
demonstrate the importance of the jnk signaling
pathway and c-jun activation for the functional properties of  xxxg1996xxx -eto.

an autocrine growth factor loop involving g-csf and
its receptor is important for jnk phosphorylation in
 xxxg1996xxx -eto expressing cells
the question remains, how  xxxg1996xxx -eto, which has no
known kinase activity, induced the jnk signaling
pathway.  xxxg1996xxx -eto has recently been shown to
upregulate the expression of the  xxxg529xxx  (shimizu
et al., 2000), which can mediate ras-dependent activation of the jnk signaling pathway (rausch and
marshall, 1997). therefore, we analysed the microarray
analysis data on leukemic patient samples, as described
in figure 1a, for mrna expression levels of the g- xxxg525xxx . we found that t(8;21)-, t(15;17)- or inv(16)-positive
aml cells and also cml cells contained signiﬁcantly
higher expression levels of  xxxg529xxx  mrna than
normal bone marrow cells (figure 6a). we then
examined the mrna and protein expression levels of
the  xxxg529xxx  and its ligand g-csf in u937t/a-e and
u937t control cells upon tetracycline withdrawal by
real-time pcr and western blot analysis, respectively.

to test whether g-csf and its receptor are important
for activating jnk signaling pathways in  xxxg1996xxx -eto
expressing cells, we stimulated u937t/a-e cells after
48 h of  xxxg1996xxx -eto induction with a  xxxg529xxx -neutralizing antibody. this antibody interacts with the
ligand-binding domain of the  xxxg529xxx  and inhibits
binding of g-csf. we found that the elevated levels of
phosphorylated p46 and p54 isoforms of jnk in
 xxxg1996xxx -eto expressing cells were reduced by about
10-fold after addition of  xxxg529xxx -neutralizing antibody. exogenous g-csf further stimulated jnk
phosphorylation in these cells two- to threefold, which
was reduced after addition of  xxxg529xxx -neutralizing
antibodies (figure 6d). these results indicate that gcsf and  xxxg529xxx  expression levels are upregulated in
 xxxg1996xxx -eto expressing cells. furthermore, g-csf and
the  xxxg529xxx  pathways are functional and participate in
 xxxg1996xxx -eto induced jnk signaling.

approximately 40% of aml is associated with the
translocations t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16) or t(9;11),
encoding for the  xxxg1996xxx -eto, pml-rara, cbfbsmmhc and mll-af9 fusion proteins, respectively
(look, 1997). despite the diversity of the involved
fusion partners, these aml-associated chimeric proteins deregulate their target genes through common
mechanisms (alcalay et al., 2001). we suggest that these
aml fusion proteins might also affect common targets
and show in the present study that  xxxg1222xxx 
was a frequently upregulated target gene (figure 1a). in
the case of t(8;21), we identiﬁed that  xxxg1996xxx -eto, by
employing an indirect mechanism including the jnk
signaling pathway, upregulated c-jun expression
through the proximal ap-1 site.
previous studies have indicated that speciﬁc signaling
events might be important for the functional properties

of  xxxg1996xxx -eto. transformation capacities of aml1eto in nih3t3 cells have been associated with
elevated levels of phosphorylated c-jun (frank et al.,
1999). in addition, wild-type eto requires h-ras for
transformation of 3t3 ﬁbroblast cells (sueoka et al.,
1998). therefore, pathways like the jnk pathway,
which are both ras- and c-jun dependent are candidate
mechanisms for  xxxg1996xxx -eto-dependent signaling. unlike leukemic fusion proteins such as bcr-abl,
 xxxg1996xxx -eto has no known intrinsic kinase activity on
its own. thus, it appears more likely that it interferes
with such signaling pathways in an indirect manner.
we propose that an autocrine mechanism involving
g-csf and the  xxxg529xxx  participates in aml1eto-mediated jnk signaling (figure 6). it has
previously been shown that primary aml blast cells
can produce and respond to their own growth factors,
like g-csf, gm-csf or il-1b, which allow them
to grow autonomously (bradbury et al., 1992). moreover, administration of g-csf stimulates cell
growth (spinner et al., 1995; baumann et al., 2001) by
activating the jnk signaling pathway (rausch
and marshall, 1999) and c-jun expression (brandstetter
et al., 1998).
in  xxxg1177xxx -dependent cell lines,  xxxg1996xxx -eto expression
has been shown to lead to g-csf-dependent proliferation (kohzaki et al., 1999). furthermore,  xxxg1996xxx -eto
promotes the expansion and self-renewal capacities of
human cd 34 þ stem cells, which is the cell type, in
which the translocation is physiologically found (mulloy
et al., 2002). the mechanism is currently unknown, but
an involvement of  xxxg1996xxx -eto in g1- to s-phase
progression is discussed, as wild-type  xxxg1996xxx  has been
shown to inhibit cell cycle progression (lou et al., 2000).
c-jun also has been implicated in g1- to s-phase
progression and cell proliferation by negatively regulating tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulators (schreiber et al., 1999; rangatia et al., 2002; peer zada et al.,
2003). the functional properties of  xxxg1996xxx -eto are
strongly depending on the maturation stage of the
progenitor cells. thus,  xxxg1996xxx -eto expression in more
mature progenitor cells results in growth arrest and
abrogates colony formation (mulloy et al., 2002).
 xxxg1996xxx -eto induction in cd34- myeloid u937 cells
reduces proliferation and the cells undergo apoptosis
after 3 days (burel et al., 2001), (figure 5b, c). our data
indicate that the jnk signaling pathway and c-jun
activation are important for the proapoptotic function
of  xxxg1996xxx -eto in u937 cells (figure 5b). therefore, we
suggest that  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun might share additional functional properties.
in primary t(8;21)-positive cells, we could further
show a correlation of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun expression
levels (figure 1d). the biological relevance of the lower
levels of c-jun and  xxxg1996xxx -eto expression in some of
the t(8;21)-positive samples is unknown. a follow-up
study on the expression levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun
might give important insights whether patients with
lower levels of  xxxg1996xxx -eto and c-jun reach complete
remission more rapidly or show a prolonged event free
survival (efs).
oncogene

upregulated c-jun expression in cml has been shown
to be important for proliferation and transformation
properties of leukemia blast cells (kurokawa et al.,
1995; raitano et al., 1995; tanaka et al., 1995). thus,
disruption of the c-jun regulating jnk pathway might
have therapeutic potential in aml, as similarly shown
in rheumatoid arthritis (han et al., 1999) or diabetes
(bonny et al., 2001). alternatively, the higher proliferative activity of aml blast cells from patients of the
favorable subgroup, including t(8;21), t(15;17) and
inv(16), might be beneﬁcial during standard chemotherapy, as it increases sensitivity to s-phase-speciﬁc agents
such as  xxxd1790xxx  (arac) (braess et al., 2001).
intriguingly, we found high levels of c-jun expression in
aml cells with translocations t(8;21), t(15;17) or
inv(16), which are associated with good response to
arac, whereas c-jun expression was low in cells with
translocation t(11q23/mll), which are generally associated with worse prognosis (bloomﬁeld et al., 2002)
(figure 1a). the good prognosis subgroups are also
more likely to produce endogenous g-csf, gm-csf or
 xxxg1177xxx  (braess et al., 2001). furthermore, t(8;21)- (shimizu et al., 2000) and t(15;17)-positive patient cells have
previously been shown to contain high levels of g- xxxg525xxx , and t(15;17)-positive cells proliferate in response to
g-csf which increases their vulnerability to cell-cyclespeciﬁc drugs (katayama et al., 1998). accordingly, we
show here that aml patient cells of the ‘favorable’
subgroups contained increased mrna expression levels
of the  xxxg529xxx  (figure 6a). the similar expression
pattern of the  xxxg529xxx  and c-jun mrna expression in
aml cells with the most common translocations
(figures 1a and 6a) further indicates that the g- xxxg525xxx  and c-jun might participate in the same signal
transduction pathway.
this is the ﬁrst report presenting data that the
leukemic fusion protein  xxxg1996xxx -eto induces autocrine
loops involving g-csf and the  xxxg529xxx , resulting via
jnk stimulation in increased expression levels of protooncogene c-jun (figure 7). we identiﬁed c-jun as a
common target among ‘good prognosis’ aml, and
propose that this knowledge might be valuable for the
therapeutic outcome of other amls.

materials and methods
cells and cell culture
a human myeloblastic u937 cell line containing the aml1eto cdna under the control of the human metallothionein
promoter in the expression vector ppc18 (u937z/a-e) was
kindly provided by pg pelicci (instituto europeo di oncologia, milano). u937z/a-e, parental u937 cells (dsmz:  xxxg553xxx )
and  xxxg1996xxx -eto expressing kasumi-1 cells (dsmz: acc220)
were grown in rpmi 1640 medium (pan biotech, aidenbach,
germany) supplemented with 10% fbs and 1% l-glutamine
(gibco brl, rockville, md, usa). an inducible aml1eto expressing u937t cell line under control of the
tetracycline (tet)-responsive transcriptional repressor tta
(u937t/a-e) and an empty vector cell line containing tta
(u937t) were as described (burel et al., 2001). recombinant

(granocyte 34, chugai, frankfurt, germany). bioactive, cellpermeable jnk inhibitor i peptides (420116) and negative
control peptides (420118) were purchased from calbiochem
(schwalbach, germany) and used as described (bonny et al.,
2001).
patient samples
patient samples were referred to the laboratory for leukemia
diagnostics, department of internal medicine iii, hospital
grosshadern, for routine cytomorphologic and cytogenetic
analyses. all samples were from the time of diagnosis and
selected for mononuclear cells by  xxxd3253xxx  gradient separation.
the percentage of blast cells within the bone marrow carrying
the respective fusion genes as detected by ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization ranged from 52 to 99% (median 90%). there
was no correlation between the percentage of blast cells and
the fusion gene transcript levels. leukemia patient samples
analysed by microarray analysis had only a single translocation, the group of t(11q23/mll)-positive patients samples
contained one sample with a t(11;19), one sample with a
t(6;11), one with a t(11;22), and seven samples with a t(9;11)
(figures 1a and 6a). microarray analysis was performed as
described (schoch et al., 2002). in the t(8;21)-positive patients
analysed by real-time pcr (figure 1b, c), four patients had
t(8;21) as sole anomaly, 13 had loss of a sex chromosome, two
had trisomy 8, and one a t(15;20). the  xxxg1996xxx -eto transcript
was observed in all cases.

western blot, antibodies
cells were lysed in ripa buffer, and proteins analysed by
western blot as described (behre et al., 2002; reddy et al.,
2002). densitometric analysis was performed using the aida
2.1 software program. in vitro translated c-jun and aml1eto were prepared as described (behre et al., 1999b) using the
tnt sp6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (promega, madison, wi, usa). phosphorylated antibodies and the nonradioactive  xxxg1372xxx /jnk assay kit were used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (new england biolabs, schwalbach, germany).  xxxg529xxx -neutralizing antibodies were applied at a concentration of 5 mg/ml (chemicon, temecula, ca,
usa). all other antibodies were obtained from santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa).
reporter constructs and expression plasmids
the human full-length c-jun promoter and various 50 truncation mutants in the ﬁreﬂy luciferase vector  xxxg2041xxx  were a kind
gift of wayne vedeckis (state university medical center, new
orleans, usa) (wei et al., 1998). the bp 79/ þ 170 proximal
c-jun promoter construct and the ap-1/cre mutation of the
same in pgl2 were kindly provided by xiao-fan wang (duke
university medical center, durham, nc, usa) (wong et al.,
1999). for generation of the bp 63/ þ 170 c-jun promoter
construct in pgl2, the fragment was pcr ampliﬁed using
sense 50 -tgg gct att ttt agg ggt tga ctg g-30
and antisense: 50 -agc cac agg cgc tag ctc tgg  xxxg30xxx  , cloned into pcr2.1 using topo ta cloning strategy
(invitrogen, groningen, the netherlands) and subcloned into
pgl2 via kpn/xhoi sites. expression plasmids for aml1eto, eto,  xxxg1996xxx  or cbfb in pcmv5 were kindly provided
by scott hiebert (st jude children’s hospital, memphis,
tennessee, usa). mouse c-jun was a kind gift of trang hoang
(clinical research institute of montreal, qc, canada). fulllength ﬂag-tagged  xxxg1371xxx  in pcmv5 was provided by roger
davis (howard hughes medical institute, ma, usa). mouse
c-jun in psp65 for in vitro translation has been described
(behre et al., 1999b).  xxxg1996xxx -eto for in vitro translation was
generated by subcloning  xxxg1996xxx -eto from pcmv5 into
pcdna 3.1( þ ) (invitrogen, groningen, the netherlands)
via xbai site.

quantitative real-time rt–pcr
for total rna isolation, the rneasy mini kit (qiagen, hilden,
germany) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. total rna (1 mg) was reversely transcribed using the
omniscript reverse transcriptase protocol (qiagen, hilden,
germany). real-time pcr was performed using the lightcycler faststart dna master sybr green i kit (roche
diagnostics, mannheim, germany) as described (reddy et al.,
2002). primers for g6pd (emig et al., 1999), c-jun (kiaris
et al., 1999) and  xxxg529xxx  (brandstetter et al., 1998) were as
described.  xxxg1996xxx -eto primers were designed with the sense
primer lying in the region of  xxxg1996xxx : 50 -atg acc tca ggt
ttg tcg gtc g-30 and the antisense primer in the

transient transfections and luciferase reporter assays
u937 cells were transiently transfected using effectene
transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(qiagen, hilden, germany). cells were split 24 h prior to
transfection to 3  105 cells/ml and harvested 30 h posttransfection.
u937t and u937t/a-e cells were kept in the maintenance
medium with and without tetracycline for 12 h prior to
transfection and harvested 24 h after transfection. the dualluciferase reporter assay system (promega, madison, wi,
usa) was performed as previously described (behre et al.,
1999a, c).

detection of apoptosis
apoptosis was detected by western blot analysis for parp.
the level of apoptosis was further assessed by ﬂow cytometry
of cells stained with annexinv–fitc and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide as
described by the manufacturer (nx50; r&d systems, wiesbaden, germany).
statistical analysis
a correlation coefﬁcient (r), and the respective p-value for
statistical signiﬁcance were calculated. the mann–whitney–
wilcoxon test was performed to compare the median of two
groups. based on the number of patient samples analysed, a p-

value p0.05 indicated statistically signiﬁcant difference
between two groups.
