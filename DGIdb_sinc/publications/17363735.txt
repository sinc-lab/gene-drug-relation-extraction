x-linked  xxxg1176xxx  (scid-x1) results from mutations
in the  xxxg1176xxx  gene, which encodes the
common gamma chain (␥c) of the receptors for interleukin (il)-2, 4, 7, 9, 15, and
21. affected infants typically lack t and

of loss of signaling via the  xxxg1183xxx  receptor
(il-7r) and the il-15r, respectively. in

nk-cell ontogeny remain incompletely understood. we used scid-x1 patient–derived ebv-transformed b cells to test the
hypothesis that the il-15r–mediated signaling is preferentially retained as ␥c
expression becomes limiting. signal
transduction via the il-15r was readily
detected in control ebv-transformed b
cells, and via the il-7r when modified to
express il-7r␣. under the same experimental conditions, patient-derived ebvtransformed b cells expressing trace
amounts of ␥c proved incapable of signal

transduction via the il-7r while retaining
the capacity for signal transduction via
the il-15r. an equivalent result was obtained in ed-7r cells modified to express
varying levels of ␥c. collectively, these
results confirm that signal transduction
via the il-15r, and hence nk ontogeny, is
preferentially retained relative to the il-7r
as ␥c expression becomes limiting.

introduction
the x-linked form of  xxxg1176xxx  ( xxxg1176xxx ) is caused by mutations in the  xxxg1176xxx  gene, which encodes the
common ␥ chain (␥c).1 affected infants typically lack both t and
natural killer (nk) cells and have normal or elevated numbers of
functionally deficient b cells that are unable to undergo immunoglobulin class switching and antibody production. the common ␥
chain is an integral component of receptors for interleukin (il)-2,
il-4,  xxxg1183xxx , il-9, il-15, and il-21 and associates with janus kinase
3 ( xxxg1221xxx ).1-3 ligand/receptor binding results in  xxxg1221xxx  activation by
transphosphorylation that in turn phosphorylates signal transducers
and activators of transcription (stats), which translocate to the
nucleus and modulate gene expression.2,4 among these ␥cdependent receptors, the  xxxg1175xxx , il-7r, and il-15r are recognized
to be essential for lymphoid ontogeny and homeostasis,5 and
deficient signaling through these receptors as a consequence of ␥c
mutations is thought to account for the classical t⫺b ⫹ nk⫺
scid-x1 phenotype. a proportion of scid-x1 infants, however,
have atypical phenotypes that remain incompletely understood.
human clinical and laboratory data, complemented with comprehensive studies in knockout mice, have demonstrated the critical
role of signal transduction via the il-7r and il-15r for t- and
nk-cell ontogeny, respectively.6,7 the il-7r is heterodimeric,
consisting of a unique il-7r␣ subunit and ␥c, while the il-15r is
heterotrimeric, consisting of a unique il-15r␣ subunit, ␥c and the
 xxxg1175xxx ␤ subunit, which is shared with the  xxxg1175xxx .5,8,9 the unique ␣
subunits confer ligand-binding specificity. mice and scid patients
with defective expression of il-7r␣ exhibit a t⫺b ⫹ nk ⫹ phenotype, indicating that signal transduction via the il-7r is required

for t-cell development, but is dispensable for nk-cell development.10 conversely, il-15r␣ knockout mice exhibit a t ⫹ b ⫹ nk⫺
phenotype, indicating that signal transduction via the il-15r is
essential for nk-cell development in vivo, but is dispensable for
t-cell development.11 these conclusions are further supported by
the defects in lymphoid ontogeny observed in  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15
knock-out mice.12,13
a subset of scid-x1 infants retain the capacity for nk cell
ontogeny and exhibit a t⫺b ⫹ nk ⫹ phenotype similar to that
observed in patients with defective il-7r␣ expression.10,14
a logical hypothesis to explain this atypical scid-x1 phenotype is that certain ␥c mutations result in preferential impairment of il-7r–mediated signaling. this is supported by the
identification of a mutant ␥c chain (a156v) isolated from an
nk ⫹ scid-x1 infant that, when expressed in the ed-7r t cell
line, conferred selective impairment of responses to il-4 and
 xxxg1183xxx  with relative maintenance of responses to il-2 and il-15.9
more recently, we have described a novel splice-site mutation in
the  xxxg1176xxx  gene in an nk ⫹ scid-x1 infant15 who was
subsequently treated by gene therapy.16 correctly spliced ␥c
mrna was reduced to trace levels and ␥c expression was
undetectable on the surface of nk cells and the majority of b
cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) analysis. in
that report we hypothesized that signal transduction via the
il-15r is preferentially retained relative to the il-7r as ␥c
expression becomes limiting.
in the current study we formally tested this hypothesis by
examining  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation in response to ␥c-dependent

cytokine stimulation in healthy control and scid-x1 patient–
derived epstein barr virus (ebv)–transformed b cell lines using
immunolabeling and fluorescence microscopy. common ␥ chain–
dependent signal transduction via both the il-15r and il-7r was
readily detected in healthy control-derived ebv-transformed b
cells, when modified to express il-7r␣. under the same experimental conditions, patient-derived ebv-transformed b cells expressing
trace amounts of ␥c, insufficient for detection at the cell surface,
proved incapable of signal transduction via the il-7r while
retaining the capacity for signal transduction via the il-15r. in
supporting studies, the same result was obtained in ed-7r cells
modified by lentivirus-mediated transduction to express varying
levels of ␥c. together these results confirm that signal transduction
via the il-15r is preferentially retained relative to the il-7r as ␥c
expression becomes limiting. given the requirement for signaling
via the il-7r and il-15r for t- and nk-cell development,
respectively, this finding provides a novel mechanism for selective
retention of nk cells in a proportion of scid-x1 infants, and has
important implications for vector design in scid-x1 gene therapy.

materials and methods
approval for the study was received from the children’s hospital at
westmead ethics committee.
cell lines
the human t-cell lines ed-7r and ed-␥c-7r have been described
previously.9 both lines express  xxxg1175xxx ␣,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, il-4r␣, il-7r␣ and
il-15r␣. the ed-␥c-7r also expresses the common ␥ chain.9 the healthy
donor-derived ebv-transformed b cell line, herein designated ebv-␥cwt,
was provided by dr graham mann (millennium institute, westmead, nsw,
australia) and the ␥c-null scid-x1 patient-derived ebv-transformed b
cell line (ebv-dr), herein designated ebv-␥cnull, was provided by
professor marina cavazzana-calvo (hôpital necker, paris, france). the
ebv-␥clow was generated in-house from bone marrow cells from a
previously described scid-x1 patient with the mutation c.468 ⫹ 3 a3c15
using ebv provided by mala ratnamohan (icpmr, westmead, nsw,
australia). the above lines were cultured in rpmi 1640 medium (gibcobrl, invitrogen australia, mt waverly, vic, australia) containing 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (fbs) (csl, parkville, vic, australia) and 2 mm
glutamine (gibco-brl). the hek 293 cell line has been described
previously17 and was cultured in dulbecco modified essential medium
(dmem) (gibco-brl) containing 10% fbs and 2 mm glutamine. all
cultures were grown at 37°c in a humidified 5% co2-air atmosphere.

western analysis for the detection of ␥c,  xxxg1221xxx , and  xxxg2216xxx 
cultured cells were pelleted, washed twice with cold pbs, and lysed by
resuspension in lysis buffer (10 mm tris.cl ph7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm
edta, 2 mm na3vo4, 2 mm na2moo4, 1% (v/v) nonidet p40, 1 ⫻ complete protease inhibitor (roche diagnostics, castle hill, nsw, australia),
0.001% (v/w) aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride) and
gentle agitation at 4°c for 30 minutes. protein concentrations were
determined using a dc protein assay kit (bio-rad, hercules, ca). for each
sample, 100 ␮g of protein was separated using sds-page and transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane. blots were probed with either biotinylated rat
antihuman ␥c (1:1000), rabbit antihuman  xxxg1221xxx  or rabbit antihuman  xxxg2216xxx 
(1:1000, both from santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca). blots
were also probed for actin (1:500, sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo) to ensure
equivalent amounts of protein were loaded to each lane. hrp-conjugated
goat antirabbit igg (1:20 000 bio-rad) or hrp-streptavidin (1:15 000,
perkinelmer inc., waltham, ma) were used as secondary detection
reagents and immobilized hrp was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (pierce biotechnology inc., rockford, il).
cytokine stimulation and detection of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation
prior to cytokine stimulation cells were washed in rpmi 1640 medium and
incubated overnight in rpmi 1640 medium containing 0.02% (w/v) bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (bsa fraction v; roche diagnostics). the following day,
cells were incubated with il-2 (100 pm to 100 nm),  xxxg1183xxx  (100 pm to
1000 nm) or il-15 (100 pm to 1000 nm) (r&d systems, inc, bioscientific)
for 20 minutes at 37°c followed by chilling to 4°c to halt cytokine
activation. cells were then cytospun onto prepared slides and fixed in
ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (ph 7.4) followed by ice cold
methanol, each for 30 minutes.21 cells were then incubated in pbs
containing 10% fbs and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide (ajax chemicals,
auburn, nsw, australia) for at least 1 hour, labeled with rabbit antipstat5 (cell signaling, genesearch, arundel, qld, australia), and stored
overnight at 4°c in a humidified chamber. the following day, cells were
stained with goat antirabbit alexa fluor 488 antibody (molecular probes,
invitrogen australia), and nuclei counterstained with 4⬘6⬘diamidino-2
phenylindole (dapi) (sigma-aldrich). slides were mounted using 2.5%
(w/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco) (sigma-aldrich), 50 mm
tris (ph8.0) and 90% (v/v) glycerol and examined using a leica clsm
confocal microscope (leica microsystems ag, germany) equipped with an
argon/krypton laser and leica objective x40 / na 1.3. cells, positive or
negative for pstat5, were counted either directly from the bx51 olympus
microscope (olympus mt waverley, australia) image field using olympus
objectives x20 / na 0.5, x40 / na 0.75 and x60 / na 1.4, or from images
captured with a spot enhanced sp6.o ccd camera using spot software
version 4.0.1 (diagnostic instruments, scitech pty ltd, vic, australia).

facs analysis for the detection of cell-surface markers
and dna ploidy
the cell-surface antibody-labeling methods used have been previously
described.18 flow cytometry was performed on a facscan cytometer
running cellquest software version 3.1f (becton dickinson, north ryde,
nsw, australia). cells were phenotyped with saturating concentrations of
murine antibodies to human  xxxg375xxx  (dako australia, botany, nsw, australia),  xxxg1175xxx ␣ (cd25) (bd biosciences, north ryde, nsw, australia),
 xxxg1175xxx ␤ ( xxxg1175xxx ) (pharmingen, bd biosciences), il-7r␣ ( xxxg1184xxx ) (immunotech, beckman coulter, gladesville, nsw, australia) conjugated to
either fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) or phycoerythrin (pe). biotinylated rat antihuman  xxxg1175xxx ␥ ( xxxg1176xxx ) (pharmingen, bd pharmingen)19 and
biotinylated mutant human il-15/mouse fc fusion protein (chimerigen,
bioscientific, gymea, nsw, australia) were detected using rpeconjugated streptavidin (dako). dna ploidy in ebv-transformed b cell
lines was determined as previously described.20

to obtain the human il-7r␣ cdna, genomic dna was extracted from
ed-7r cells using the qiaamp dna blood mini kit (qiagen, doncaster,
vic, australia). pcr was performed to amplify il-7r␣ cdna using the
following forward and reverse primers, 5⬘-ccaccatgacaattctaggtacaac-3⬘ and 5⬘-tcactggttttggtagaagc-3⬘, respectively. reaction conditions were 30 cycles of 94°c for 30 seconds, 52°c for
30 seconds, and 72°c for 3 minutes using pfu ultra dna polymerase

was collected 48 and 72 hours after transfection, filtered through a 0.45␮m-pore-size cellulose acetate membrane (sartorius ag, east oakleigh,
vic, australia) and concentrated by using the vivaspin 20 filtration
system with a 100-kda molecular weight membrane cut-off (sartorius

virus by hiv-1 p24 elisa (perkin-elmer life sciences, rowville, vic,
australia) after inoculation of hek 293 cell cultures with vector
supernatant and serial passaging. transduction titres were determined
on hek 293 cells in the presence of polybrene (8 ␮g/ml culture
medium; sigma-aldrich) by using real-time quantitative pcr and
previously published primer and probe sequences.28
viral transduction
the ebv-transformed b-cell lines, ebv-␥cwt and ebv-␥clow, were transduced at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 25 to produce lines designated
ebv-␥cwt-il-7r␣ and ebv-␥clow-il-7r␣, respectively. the ed-7r cell
line was transduced at an moi of 10 for egfp-expressing vectors or 25 for
vectors expressing the ␥c transgene. transduction was performed in the
presence of polybrene (8 ␮g/ml of culture medium). flow cytometry was
performed on a facscanto cytometer (bd biosciences) running facs
diva software (version 5.0.1). cells expressing egfp were enumerated and
the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) calculated for each facs profile.

␥c mrna and ␥c-dependent cytokine receptor expression in
ebv-transformed cell lines

we have previously described a scid-x1 infant with an atypical
t⫺nk ⫹ phenotype caused by a novel intron 3 splice-site mutation
in ␥c15. this mutation leads to the production of 2 aberrantly
spliced ␥c mrna species and trace amounts of correctly spliced
message. to facilitate in vitro analysis of the impact of this
mutation on ␥c-dependent signal transduction, patient bone marrow cells harvested prior to treatment with gene therapy16 were
transformed with ebv and the resultant cell line designated
ebv-␥clow. analysis of ␥c mrna species in ebv-␥clow cells by
rt-pcr confirmed retention of the pattern previously reported in
patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) (fig. 1). as
expected, a single ␥c mrna species was detected in control

figure 1. ebv-transformed patient cells exhibit the same aberrant ␥c mrna
splicing pattern as previously studied patient pbmcs. rt-pcr analysis showed
a single 439 bp product representing correctly spliced ␥c mrna in healthy
control-derived ebv-␥cwt cells (lane 4) and 3 products of 439, 499 and 650 bp in
patient-derived ebv-␥clow cells (lane 6). these represent trace amounts of correctly
spliced ␥c mrna, a species with aberrant intron 3 splicing and a predominant
species with complete failure of intron 3 splicing, respectively. m indicates molecular

either antibodies to  xxxg1175xxx ␥,  xxxg1175xxx ␣,  xxxg1175xxx ␤, il-7r␣, or il-15r␣ (solid lines) or to the
isotype control (gray filled) and subjected to facs analysis. percentages shown in
each panel represent the proportion of cells expressing detectable levels of the
indicated cell surface receptor subunit. (b) lysates of the above cell lines were
analyzed for  xxxg1221xxx ,  xxxg2216xxx  or actin using sds-page and western blotting. immobilized proteins were detected using hrp-conjugated secondary reagents and enhanced chemilumiscence.

ebv-transformed b cells, designated ebv-␥cwt, obtained from a
healthy donor.
analysis of ebv-␥clow cells by facs revealed that cell surface
␥c expression was below the limit of detection (fig. 2a), consistent
with the presence of only trace amounts of correctly spliced ␥c
mrna. cell surface ␥c was similarly undetectable on ebvtransformed b cells, obtained from a scid-x1 patient with a
confirmed null mutation in the ␥c gene, designated ebv-␥cnull,
while ␥c expression was readily detected on healthy donor-derived
ebv-␥cwt cells. the anti-␥c antibody used successfully for facs
had insufficient sensitivity to detect ␥c by western analysis (not
shown). further phenotyping of these  xxxg375xxx  ⫹ dna diploid cell
lines, for the ␥c-dependent il-2-,  xxxg1183xxx - and il-15- cytokine
receptors, demonstrated expression of  xxxg1175xxx ␣,  xxxg1175xxx ␤ and il15r␣ but not il-7r␣ (fig. 2a). this latter result is consistent with
the known loss of il-7r␣ expression on mature b cells.29,30
positive control ed-␥c-7r cells expressed all receptor subunits
examined. in addition, given the intention to evaluate signaling
through ␥c-dependent cytokine receptors, expression of immediate
downstream targets in the signal transduction pathway,  xxxg1221xxx  and
 xxxg2216xxx , were confirmed in all lines by western analysis (fig. 2b).

infant described, we hypothesized that limiting levels of ␥c
expression differentially affects signal transduction via the il-7r
and il-15r receptors with retention of il-15r-mediated signaling
at lower ␥c expression levels. as a first step toward testing this
hypothesis in patient-derived ebv-␥clow cells, we investigated
 xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in response to
il-15 stimulation.
phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  is commonly measured by western analysis, however, in order to achieve optimal sensitivity we
used an immunofluorescence microscopy method that allows
visualization and sub-cellular localization of pstat5 in individual cells. using this assay,  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was

observed in a proportion of ebv-␥cwt cells following stimulation with saturating concentrations of il-2 and il-15 (fig. 3a).
interestingly,  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was also observed in
ebv-␥clow cells under the same experimental conditions, albeit
in a smaller proportion. this result is consistent with retention
of ␥c-dependent signaling through  xxxg1175xxx  and il-15r despite
undetectable levels of ␥c at the cell surface (fig. 2a). in the
negative control ebv-␥cnull cell line, which completely lacks ␥c
expression, no  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was observed in response to cytokine stimulation confirming the specificity and
␥c-dependence of the assay (fig. 3a).
to better characterize the retention of il-15r-mediated signaling in patient-derived ebv-␥clow cells, the percentage of cells
exhibiting  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation over a range of il-15 concentrations was compared with that observed in healthy donor-derived
ebv-␥cwt cells (table 1). for both ebv-␥cwt and ebv-␥clow,
 xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was detected at concentrations as low as
100 pm and was maximal  xxxd1891xxx  nm and above. however, the
percentage of cells exhibiting  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was consistently lower in ebv-␥clow cells.
as expected,  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was not detected in any
of the ebv cell lines following stimulation with a saturating
concentration of  xxxg1183xxx  (fig. 3a), consistent with absence of
constitutive cell surface il-7r␣ expression (fig. 2a). in the
positive control ed-␥c-7r cell line,  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation
was observed after stimulation with each of the 3 ␥c-dependent
cytokines tested.
to confirm nuclear translocation of pstat5 in ebvtransformed cell lines following il-15-stimulation, further
analyses by nuclear counter-staining with dapi were performed
(fig. 3b). characteristic nuclear localization of pstat5 was
observed in both ebv-␥cwt and ebv-␥clow, and also in the
positive control cell line ed-␥c-7r. collectively these results
confirm retention of il-15r-mediated signaling in ebv-␥clow
cells consistent with the atypical nk ⫹ phenotype of the
scid-x1 infant from which they were derived.
patient-derived ebv-␥clow-il-7r␣ cells do not respond
to  xxxg1183xxx  stimulation

to facilitate analysis of ␥c-dependent signal transduction via the
il-7r, a lentiviral vector encoding the il-7r␣ cdna was constructed (fig. 4a) and used to transduce ebv-␥cwt and ebv-␥clow
cells. similar levels of il-7r␣ expression were achieved in each
cell line (fig. 4b) with ploidy,  xxxg375xxx , and ␥c expression levels
remaining equivalent to the parental lines (data not shown). the
capacity of these cell lines to phosphorylate  xxxg2216xxx  after  xxxg1183xxx 
stimulation was then tested over a range of cytokine concentrations
(fig. 4c and table 2). following  xxxg1183xxx  stimulation, pstat5 was
detected in il-7r␣-expressing ebv-␥cwt cells at all concentrations
tested down to 100 pm. in contrast, pstat5 phosphorylation was
not observed in il-7r␣-expressing ebv-␥clow cells following  xxxg1183xxx

these results suggest that the limiting level of ␥c expression on
patient-derived ebv-␥clow cells, while sufficient for il-15r–
mediated signaling (and  xxxg1175xxx –mediated signaling), is insufficient
for il-7r–mediated signaling.
limiting ␥c expression preferentially impairs  xxxg1183xxx 
receptor–mediated signaling

to further substantiate our hypothesis and confirm dependence on
␥c expression levels, we next sought to examine the effect of
titrating ␥c expression on ␥c-dependent signal transduction in the

␥c-null ed-7r cell line. expression levels of  xxxg1175xxx ␥,  xxxg1175xxx ␣,
 xxxg1175xxx ␤, il-7r␣, il-15r␣, and  xxxg1221xxx  and  xxxg2216xxx  were confirmed
by facs and western analysis, respectively (not shown), and
found to be equivalent to those shown for ed-␥c-7r cells (fig. 2).
as an initial step toward the generation of ed-7r cells with
varying levels of ␥c expression, a series of lentiviral vectors
encoding either egfp or ␥c under the transcriptional control of
selected internal heterologous promoters were constructed. to
determine the relative strength of each promoter, ed-7r cells were
transduced at an moi of 10 with the egfp-encoding vector set.
this moi was chosen to ensure that the majority of cells contained
single integration events so that the relative strength of each
promoter could be accurately assessed. analysis of egfp expression by facs revealed a hierarchy of promoter strengths with the
ef1␣ promoter being the strongest (mfi ⫽ 28 276) (fig. 5). this
was 5.0-, 4.7-, 8.8-, and 20.7-fold stronger than the pgk
(mfi ⫽ 5615), ltr (mfi ⫽ 6007), wasp (mfi ⫽ 3225), and
 xxxg1221xxx  (mfi ⫽ 1369) promoters, respectively.
the ␥c-encoding vector set, containing the same promoters,
was then used to transduce ed-7r cells and resultant cell surface
␥c expression determined by facs. expression of ␥c was detectable following expression with vectors containing the ef1␣ and
pgk promoters, but not for vectors containing the ltr, wasp, and
 xxxg1221xxx  promoters (fig. 6a). analysis of integrated provirus and ␥c
mrna by quantitative pcr and rt-pcr, respectively, confirmed
molecular transduction and ␥c transgene expression for all vectors
(not shown). this result was consistent with ␥c being expressed on
the surface of ed-7r cells transduced with the vectors containing
the ltr, wasp, and  xxxg1221xxx  promoters, but at levels below the limit
of detection by facs (fig. 6a). each vector was then evaluated for
the capacity to reconstitute ␥c-dependent signaling (fig. 6b).
following stimulation with the ␥c-dependent cytokines il-2,  xxxg1183xxx ,
and il-15,  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was detected in ed-7r cells
transduced with the ef1␣, pgk, and ltr promoter constructs. in

figure 6. ␥c expression and ␥c-dependent cytokine signaling in ed-7r cells
following lentiviral vector transduction. (a) ed-7r cells were transduced at an
moi of 25 by vectors encoding ␥c under the transcriptional control of the indicated
promoters. after 10 days cells were labeled with anti-␥c antibody and analyzed by
facs. (b) immunofluorescence images of the above transduced cell populations

 xxxg1221xxx  promoters, however,  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was observed
following il-2 and il-15 stimulation, but not  xxxg1183xxx . these results
are entirely consistent with those obtained using scid-x1 patientderived ebv-transformed b cells, and confirm the conclusion that
expression of limiting levels of cell surface ␥c preferentially
impairs signaling via the il-7r.

discussion
we have previously reported a novel splice-site mutation in the
␥c-encoding  xxxg1176xxx  gene in a scid-x1 infant with an atypical nk ⫹
phenotype who was subsequently treated by gene therapy.15,16 this
mutation reduced correctly spliced ␥c mrna to trace levels such that
cell surface ␥c expression was below the limits of detection by facs
analysis on nk cells and the majority of b cells. given the known
requirement for ␥c-dependent signaling via the il-7r and il-15r for tand nk-cell ontogeny, respectively, we hypothesized that il-15r–
mediated signaling, and hence nk ontogeny, is preferentially retained as
␥c expression becomes limiting.
in the current study we first tested this hypothesis using healthy
control and scid-x1 patient-derived ebv-transformed b cells and a
highly sensitive and specific assay to measure  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation
in individual cells in response to ␥c-dependent cytokine stimulation.

blood, 1 july 2007 䡠 volume 110, number 1

signal transduction via il-15r was readily detectable at physiologic
cytokine concentrations in healthy donor-derived ebv-transformed b
cells, and via the il-7r when modified to express il-7r␣. under the
same experimental conditions, patient-derived ebv-transformed b cells
expressing trace amounts of ␥c proved incapable of signal transduction
via the il-7r while retaining the capacity for signal transduction via the
il-15r. moreover, increasing the concentration of  xxxg1183xxx  to in excess of
1000-fold above physiologic levels did not overcome the observed
block to il-7r–mediated signaling. although not a specific focus of the
current study, we also observed retention of  xxxg1175xxx –mediated signaling
in the presence of limiting ␥c expression. to independently substantiate
data obtained using healthy control and scid-x1 patient-derived
ebv-transformed b cells we next confirmed dependence on ␥c levels
by titrating ␥c expression in the ␥c-null ed-7r cell line. this was
achieved by using ␥c-encoding lentiviral vectors containing internal
promoters with a 20-fold range of transcriptional activities. in this
context, free of possible confounding variables present in the ebvtransformed b cell studies, we again observed preferential loss of
il-7r-mediated signaling at low ␥c expression levels. indeed, this result
was replicated with each of the 2 least transcriptionally active vector
constructs. loss of signaling through the  xxxg1175xxx  and il-15r was not
observed, even at the lowest ␥c expression levels achieved.
collectively, these results confirm our hypothesis and reveal
a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mutations in
the ␥c-encoding  xxxg1176xxx  gene can differentially impact t- and
nk-cell ontogeny. another group has previously reported a
mutant ␥c (a156v) isolated from an nk ⫹ scid-x1 infant, that
when expressed in ed-7r cells conferred selective impairment
of responses to il-4 and  xxxg1183xxx  with relative maintenance of
responses to il-2 and il-15.9 together these studies show that
preferential retention of nk cell ontogeny in scid-x1 infants
can be the consequence of mutations that result in both
qualitative and quantitative abnormalities in ␥c expression. in
this latter study the underlying mechanism appeared to be
preferential impairment of the ligand-binding affinity of the
il-4r and il-7r containing the mutant ␥c. clearly, a different
mechanistic explanation is required to explain our results where
the ligand-binding affinity of any ␥c-dependent cytokine receptors formed would be predicted to be normal.
high-affinity receptors for il-2 and il-15 are heterotrimeric,
containing unique  xxxg1175xxx ␣ and il-15r␣ subunits, a shared  xxxg1175xxx ␤
subunit and ␥c.31,32 the receptor for  xxxg1183xxx  has substantially lower
ligand-binding affinity and is heterodimeric, containing a unique
il-7r␣ subunit and ␥c9. these differences in ligand-binding
affinities alone are insufficient to explain our findings as experiments were carried out under conditions where ligand concentrations were in excess and all available ␥c-dependent receptors
would have been saturated. failure of ␥c-dependent signal transduction via the il-7r, as measured by  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation,
therefore directly implies the presence of insufficient receptor
numbers to initiate the intracellular  xxxg1221xxx / xxxg2216xxx  signal cascade.
this being the case, there are 2 possible mechanisms. first, the
number of activated  xxxg1175xxx  and il-15r required to initiate the
 xxxg1221xxx / xxxg2216xxx  intracellular signal cascade may be lower than for the
il-7r. alternatively, under conditions where the availability of ␥c
is limiting there may be higher numbers of il-2 and il-15
receptors, possibly as a consequence of more effective competition
for the pathologically low number of ␥c chains available for
receptor assembly. further dissection of mechanism will be challenging. for example, use of scatchard analysis, which is commonly used to determine receptor numbers and ligand binding
affinities, is confounded by the fact that the il-15r␣ subunit binds

blood, 1 july 2007 䡠 volume 110, number 1

il-15 with extremely high affinity irrespective of whether the
subunit is assembled into a functional heterotrimeric receptor.31
in addition to providing insight into the molecular basis of the
nk ⫹ scid-x1 phenotype our data may have implications for the
treatment of scid-x1 by gene therapy. with current gene delivery
technologies, successful reconstitution of the t- and nk-cell
compartments relies on the selective growth advantage of genemodified progenitor cells over unmodified counterparts. in the
nk ⫹ scid-x1 infant whose ebv-transformed b cells were
investigated in this report, gene therapy resulted in only partial
reconstitution of the t-cell compartment and little or no effect on
the infant’s preexisting but functionally abnormal nk-cell compartment.16 while the relatively low dose of ␥c ⫹ /cd34 ⫹ cells used
(1.3 ⫻ 106/kg) is likely to have been a contributory factor, the
infant’s partial phenotype may also have exerted an affect. the
preexistence of an nk cell compartment before gene therapy, as a
consequence of retention of il-15r–mediated signaling, would
have almost certainly resulted in reduced competitive advantage
for gene-modified cells undergoing nk–cell ontogeny. whether
there might also have been an impact on reconstitution of the t-cell
compartment is more speculative. given the presence of low-level
␥c expression, successful signal transduction via the il-7r in early
t-cell ontogeny cannot be ruled out. the functional consequence
for il-7r formation of competition among ␥c-dependent cytokine
receptors for a limiting numbers of ␥c chains would be determined
by the relative levels of expression of subunits for other ␥cdependent receptor subunits. as more infants with partial scid-x1
phenotypes undergo gene therapy the impact of such phenotypes on
immunologic reconstitution should become clearer.
our data have further important implications for researchers
involved in the development of safer vectors for scid-x1 gene
therapy. the development of leukemia in 3 of 11 infants treated in
the paris-based scid-x1 gene therapy trial has been shown to be
the consequence of vector insertion in or near oncogene loci, such
as  xxxg1333xxx , leading to aberrant activation driven by proximity to
strong enhancer elements in the vector ltr promoter.33,34 this has
lead to a desire to trial vectors with self-inactivating ltrs and
carefully selected internal heterologous promoters with less potent
enhancer activity. our data define a new risk to vector therapeutic
efficacy. as promoter enhancer strength is reduced, an increasing
proportion of integrated proviral genomes will give rise to limiting
levels of ␥c expression. based on our results, this phenomenon has
the potential to skew reconstitution toward the nk compartment
with t-cell reconstitution becoming dependent on increasingly
fewer high expressing integration sites. novel ␥c-encoding vectors
intended for human clinical use should therefore be tested to ensure
that they not only minimize transactivation events but also provide
adequately robust ␥c expression to ensure that a high proportion of
integration events in progenitor cells express sufficient ␥c to ensure
both t- and nk-cell ontogeny. the assay system used in this report
should prove to be a useful tool for such analyses.
up to the present time, the majority of studies examining the
effect of ␥c mutations on signal transduction have used western
blot analysis and necessitated the biochemical and genetic manipulation of large numbers of cultured cells such as the ed-7r cell
line.7,9 in the current study, however, we were faced with the
challenge of studying the impact of a novel splice-site mutation that
could not be modeled by simple transfection of mutant ␥c cdna.
this challenge was overcome by directly analyzing patient-derived
ebv-transformed b cells. therefore, anticipating the need to
derive data from relatively small cells numbers, we chose to use an
intracellular immuno-cytochemical assay system that facilitated

limiting ␥c in il-7r and il-15r signalling

97

analysis of ␥c-dependent signal transduction in individual cells and
required at least an order of magnitude fewer cells than western
blotting.35 indeed, the relatively low proportion of ebv-transformed b cells from both healthy donor and scid-x1 patients
exhibiting responsiveness to ␥c-dependent cytokine stimulation
precluded the use of more conventional methodologies. in addition
to the desired sensitivity, which allowed direct analysis of patientderived cells, the assay proved to be highly specific with  xxxg2216xxx 
phosphorylation events being dependent on the presence of both ␥c
expression and cytokine stimulation.
a tangential, but nevertheless interesting, question arising from
the use of immunofluorescence microscopy to detect pstat5 in
individual cells is the relationship between ␥c expression levels,
the proportion of cells exhibiting  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation and the
level of phosphorylation per cell. in experiments using both
ebv-transformed b cells and ed-7r cells, the proportion of cells
exhibiting detectable  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation following cytokine
stimulation was reduced in cells expressing ␥c at lower levels. the
corresponding level of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation observed in individual cells, however, was not uniformly reduced with some cells
remaining capable of high-level  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation despite
low-level ␥c expression. this observation suggests that a threshold
for triggering  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation may exist whereby the
number of cell surface receptors increases the probability of the
threshold being reached, but exerts relatively less influence on the
resultant level of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation.
in summary, using healthy donor and scid-x1 patient-derived
ebv-transformed b cells, lentiviral vector-transduced ed-7r
cells, and a sensitive immuno-cytochemical assay to measure
 xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation, we show that limiting ␥c expression
preferentially impairs signal transduction via the il-7r while
signaling via the il-15 receptor is retained. this result provides a
novel explanation for the atypical nk ⫹ scid-x1 phenotype, and
has implications for the treatment of scid-x1 by gene therapy.
