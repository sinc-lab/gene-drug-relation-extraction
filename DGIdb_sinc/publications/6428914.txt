summary. soybean lipoxygenase inhibition has been
proposed as an in vitro biochemical model for the
antiinflammatory action of certain drugs used in the
treatment of ulcerative colitis. in an extension of a
recent study which showed that therapeutically active compounds, such as  xxxd3255xxx  and its colonic metabolite 5- xxxd153xxx  were soybean
lipoxygenase inhibitors, it has now been shown that
n-acetylaminosalicylic acid, the principal metabolite
of 5- xxxd153xxx , also inhibits soybean lipoxygenase in a dose dependent and noncompetitive
m a n n e r (ki 3.0 x 10-sm, ics0 250 ~m). sulphapyridine, the other major metabolite of  xxxd3255xxx ,
which has been demonstrated to be inactive in the
treatment of ulcerative colitis, did not inhibit the lipoxygenase activity. the findings further support the
hypothesis that only the therapeutically active compounds are soybean lipoxygenase inhibitors.

acute muscosal inflammation of the colon in ulcerative colitis has been shown to be characterized by
polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) accumulation [1, 2]. since  xxxd3255xxx , the mainstay of therapy in this disease, and its colonic cleavage product,
5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) [3], were shown to inhibit p m n l function [4], the antiinflammatory action was considered to be derived, at least in part,
from local inhibition of lipoxygenase by these compounds [5,6]. lipoxygenase catalyzes the formation
of a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as hy-

droperoxytetraenoic acids (hete) and leukotrienes,
from  xxxd208xxx  in inflammatory states in animals and man [7,8]. in support of the view that lipoxygenase inhibition may be a possible pharmacological action in ulcerative colitis, sircar et al. [5] found
that  xxxd3255xxx  and its active metabolite  xxxd2579xxx 
inhibited soybean lipoxygenase in a dose dependent
manner [5]. this enzyme is considered to behave like
human lipoxygenases [9], since comparability of
their substrate and inhibition characteristics has
been demonstrated [10]. to test further the hypothesis that the only therapeutically active derivatives of
 xxxd3255xxx  are soybean lipoxygenase inhibitors, two additional metabolites of  xxxd3255xxx 
have been examined, n-acetylaminosalicylic acid
(acasa) and sulphapyridine: the first shown to be
therapeutically active when administered directly
into the rectum [11], and the latter has been demonstrated to be ineffective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis [12].

materials and methods
soybean lipoxygenase ( xxxg147xxx .12), as the ammonium sulphate fraction, and sodium linoleate were
obtained from sigma chemicals (st. louis, mo,
usa). n-acetyl-amino- xxxd3159xxx , 5-amino- xxxd3159xxx  and sulphapyridine were gifts from
deutsche pharmacia gmbh (freiburg i.br., frg).
the other chemicals came from commercial sources
and were of analytical grade.
lipoxygenase activity was determined by the increase in absorption/min at 234 nm (zeiss, spektralphotometer d m r 10) caused by the appearance of
dihydroperoxylinoleic acid from linoleate catalyzed
by the enzyme [13]. the incubation mixture contained 100 ~lm sodium linoleate (or concentrations

as specified) dissolved in 1% pure ethanol, tris/hc1
buffer (0.1 m, ph 9.0) and enzyme (0.014 mg/ml) to
give a linear increase of absorbance for at least 5 minutes. n-acetyl- xxxd153xxx , 5-aminosalicylic
acid,  xxxd2748xxx  (ngda), a potent inhibitor of lipoxygenase [14] or sulphapyridine were
added in final concentrations as indicated. measurements were performed at room temperature [13]
against a blank containing all constituents except the
enzyme. the reaction was started by addition of the
enzyme; uv absorption by the added lipoxygenase
at the concentrations in the test system was negligable.
protein was determined by the method of lowry
et al. [15].
the percentage inhibition of lipoxygenase activity was calculated from the ratio of the activity in the
presence and absence of added substances. km and
vmaxwere obtained from lineweaver-burk diagrams

in the presence of acasa, dose dependent inhibition of the soybean lipoxygenase activity was observed, with an ics0 value of 250 ~tm (fig. 1). the km
was j.2x10-4m (fig.2) in the presence and
4.1 x 10-4m in the absence of inhibitors. the inhibition constant (ki), calculated from the equation
ics0/s = ki/km [16], was 3.0 x 10-8m. the different
x and y-intercepts (vmax 3.07 p.mol/min/mg in the
presence and 13.3 ~tmol/min/mg in the absence of
acasa 450 ~tm) in the lineweaver-burk plot (fig. 2)
pointed to noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition.
 xxxd2579xxx  inhibited soybean lipoxygenase in a similar dose dependent and noncompetitive manner (ki:
3.15 x 10-8m). except for one pint (at 200 ~tm), the
two inhibition curves did not differ significantly. the
ics0 value was 175 ~tm. n g d a inhibited the enzyme
to 46.5% at 9 ~xm. in contrast to acasa,  xxxd2579xxx  and
ngda, sulphapyridine did not inhibit soybean lipoxygenase activity, even at concentrations as high
as 1000 ~tm.

discussion

in spite of the fact that  xxxd3255xxx  has been used
in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease for many years [17], the mechanism of its action
is not completely understood. clinical trials have
shown that the local antiinflammatory action of
 xxxd2579xxx , the metabolite released from the parent drug
 xxxd3255xxx  by colonic bacterial cleavage [3], is
most probably the active therapeutic principle [12,
j8]. explanations proposed on the basis of an action
on local colonic prostaglandin synthesis and/or metabolism are contradictory [j9, 20]. lipoxygenase inhibition has recently been proposed as an alternative
explanation for the antiinflammatory action [5, 6].
since soybean lipoxygenase has been shown to resemble the human enzyme in a number of ways [9,
10], it has been used to study the actions of certain
antiinflammatory drugs, such as  xxxd2579xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx  [5].
in the present study it was shown that n-acetylaminosalicylic acid, which is very probably an active
metabolite of  xxxd3255xxx  [11], and  xxxd2579xxx  inhibi-

ted soybean lipoxygenase. the inhibition by both
compounds was dose dependent and showed a non
competitive mechanism with similar kinetic characteristics. relative to the inhibitory potency of
ngda, a known inhibitor of lipoxygenase [14], the
inhibition was about twenty times weaker if compared by the ic50values (ics0 of ngda: 9 ~m). sulphapyridine, on the other hand, was completely inactive.
the finding supports the hypothesis that only
therapeutically active compounds, such as  xxxd3255xxx  [17],  xxxd2579xxx  [18] and n-acetyl-aminosalicylic
acid [11], are soybean lipoxygenase inhibitors,
whereas inactive ones are not. this concept is further
supported by the finding that cyclooxygenase inhibitors with no or low lipoxygenase inhibition, such as
 xxxd2352xxx  [21, 20],  xxxd2141xxx  [23] and salicylate [24], are not effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. since intermediary radicals
have demonstrated to be present during the lipoxygenase reaction [25], radical trapping by  xxxd2579xxx  and
other compounds has been proposed as a possible
mechanism of lipoxygenase inhibition [26]. further
studies on lipoxygenase preparations from human
colonic mucosa are necessary before these findings
can be extrapolated to man.
