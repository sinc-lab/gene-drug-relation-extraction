assess drug effects on sexual maturation, reproduction and
cns development; a case registry spanning at least
15 years to determine effects of the drug on incidence of
medullary thyroid cancer; a comparative study with insulin
 xxxd2362xxx  in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with
moderate-to-severe renal impairment; and a study to assess
the impact of the drug on cardiovascular risk in patients
with high baseline risk of cardiovascular events [6]. the
ongoing nct01621178 and nct01394952 studies have
been designed to evaluate  xxxd1951xxx  in patients with renal
impairment and high baseline cardiovascular risk, respectively [7].

2 scientific summary
2.1 pharmacodynamics
 xxxd1951xxx  is a fusion protein produced using mammalian
cell culture and consisting of two identical disulphidelinked chains, each with a n-terminal glp-1 analogue
sequence that is covalently linked by a peptide linker to the
fc component of a modified human immunoglobulin g4
heavy chain (igg4 fc) [1, 3]. fusion to this large carrier
moiety slows its clearance from the body. the glp-1
analogue component is 90 % homologous to endogenous
human glp-12 (7-37), but with structural modifications in
the area of the molecule that interacts with  xxxg651xxx .
additional modifications were made in areas of the glp-1
molecule that have potential as epitopes for t cells, and in
areas of the igg4 fc component that bind fc receptors and

contribute to half-antibody formation. these modifications
are intended to reduce the immunogenicity of the protein
[1, 3].
the  xxxd1951xxx  mechanism of action involves activation
of the  xxxg899xxx , a membrane-bound cell-surface
receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase in b cells [3]. thus, it
increases intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  in these cells, leading to
a glucose-dependent release of insulin.  xxxd1951xxx  also
reduces secretion of glucagon and slows gastric emptying
[3].
in clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, onceweekly subcutaneous  xxxd1951xxx  0.75 or 1.5 mg reduced
both fasting and postprandial serum glucose concentrations
and postprandial serum glucose incremental area under the
concentration-time curve (auc) and increased first-and
second-phase insulin secretion more than placebo [3].
compared with baseline, continued administration of  xxxd1951xxx  increased fasting insulin and c-peptide concentrations and reduced fasting glucagon concentrations [3].
in a thorough qtc study, there was no evidence of qtc
prolongation at  xxxd1951xxx  doses of 4 and 7 mg [3].
2.2 pharmacokinetics
healthy adults and patients with type 2 diabetes have
similar  xxxd1951xxx  pharmacokinetics [3].  xxxd1951xxx  is
slowly but well absorbed into the systemic circulation,
reaching maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) in
24–72 h (median 48 h) after a subcutaneous injection
administered at steady state. with once-weekly injections,
steady-state plasma concentrations were reached after

 xxxd1951xxx : first global approval

2–4 weeks. the site of the injection (abdomen, upper arm,
thigh) had no statistically significant effect on  xxxd1951xxx 
systemic exposure. following subcutaneous  xxxd1951xxx 
0.75 and 1.5 mg, the mean absolute bioavailability values
were 65 and 47 %, respectively; at corresponding doses,
the mean volumes of distribution were 19.2 and 17.4 l [3].
it is assumed that  xxxd1951xxx  is broken down into its
component amino acids via pathways for general protein
catabolism [3]. after administration of 0.75 or 1.5 mg
doses, the elimination half-life for both doses was
&5 days [3], which is consistent with once-weekly
administration.
there were no clinically important effects of age, sex,
race, ethnicity or bodyweight on the  xxxd1951xxx  cmax or
auc; no dose adjustment is necessary based on these
factors [3]. similarly, there were no clinically important
changes in the  xxxd1951xxx  cmax and auc values in patients
with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (small
increases were observed) or in patients with mild, moderate
or severe hepatic impairment (small decreases were
observed) [3].
2.2.1 drug interactions
as  xxxd1951xxx  slows gastric emptying, it could reduce the
rate and extent of absorption of orally administered drugs,
although in clinical pharmacological studies no clinically
important effects on absorption of tested drugs was
observed [3]. however, caution is recommended when
coadministering  xxxd1951xxx  with orally administered
drugs, with adequate monitoring of those drugs that have a
narrow therapeutic index [3].
in drug interaction studies with pharmacokinetic probes
and drugs that might be coadministered with  xxxd1951xxx ,
there were no clinically important effects of  xxxd1951xxx  on
the cmax or auc of the coadministered drugs [3].
in a study of  xxxd1951xxx  coadministered with sitagliptin,
there was no clinically relevant effect of sitagliptin on
 xxxd1951xxx  exposure [3].
2.3 therapeutic trials
the efficacy and tolerability of once-weekly subcutaneous
 xxxd1951xxx  0.75 or 1.5 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes
has been evaluated in the award [assessment of weekly
administration of ly2189265 ( xxxd1951xxx )] programme
of clinical studies conducted by eli lilly. this section
summarizes the main findings from the award-1, -2, -3,
4, -5 and -6 studies [8–13] (final results from the award7, -8 and -9 trials are not yet available).
the studies were all randomized trials versus active
comparators in patients with type 2 diabetes who were

treatment-naı̈ve or had inadequate control with current
diabetic regimens [8–13]. award-1 and -5 included a
placebo arm that received the same background therapy as
the active comparators [9, 12]. trials were open-label
(award-2, -4, -6) [10, 11, 13] or blinded (award-1, -3,
-5) [8, 9, 12]. treatments included an active comparator
arm and a  xxxd1951xxx  1.5 mg once-weekly arm (award6) [12] or  xxxd1951xxx  0.7 and 1.5 mg once-weekly arms
(award-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5) [8–11, 13]. across trials, the
primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the least
squares mean (lsm) glycosylated haemoglobin level
(hba1c) at week 26 (award-1, -3, -4, -6) or 52
(award-2, -5). for the primary analyses, award-1
tested superiority of  xxxd1951xxx  to placebo [12], whereas
the remaining trials first tested non-inferiority of  xxxd1951xxx  once-weekly to the comparator, before assessing
superiority to the comparator [8–11, 13].
across trials, once-weekly  xxxd1951xxx  0.75 or 1.5 mg
was efficacious in type 2 diabetes, based on changes from
baseline in hba1c.  xxxd1951xxx  was efficacious as monotherapy (vs. metformin) (sect. 2.3.1) and in combination
with metformin (vs. sitagliptin and vs.  xxxd2495xxx ) (sect.
2.3.2), metformin plus  xxxd2203xxx  (vs.  xxxd2362xxx )
(sect. 2.3.3), metformin plus pioglitazone (vs. exenatide)
(sect 2.3.4) and insulin lispro ±metformin (vs. insulin
 xxxd2362xxx ) (sect 2.3.5).
2.3.1 monotherapy
the award-3 trial (n = 807) evaluated the efficacy of
 xxxd1951xxx  monotherapy versus metformin (dosages up to
2,000 mg/day, as tolerated) in patients with hba1c of c6.5
and b9.5 % with diet and exercise with or without lowdose oral antihyperglycaemic medication (oam) monotherapy (oams were discontinued at the start of the
2-week lead-in period of the trial) [8]. the lsm changes in
hba1c from baseline to week 26 were -0.71, -0.78 and
-0.56 % in the  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and metformin
groups, respectively (both  xxxd1951xxx  groups p \ 0.025 vs.
metformin; noninferiority criterion met). in the  xxxd1951xxx 
0.75, 1.5 mg and metformin groups, 63, 62 and 54 % of
patients, respectively, met the hba1c target of \7.0 % at
week 26 (both  xxxd1951xxx  groups p \ 0.05 vs. metformin)
[8].
2.3.2 in combination with metformin
the award-5 trial (n = 1,098) evaluated the efficacy of
 xxxd1951xxx  versus sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo
in patients with hba1c [8.0 and b9.5 % on diet and
exercise alone or c7 and b9.5 % despite treatment with
oam monotherapy or combination therapy. during the

m. sanford

lead-in period of the trial, all patients were stabilized on
metformin  xxxd2871xxx  mg/day and other oams were discontinued [9]. the lsm changes in hba1c from baseline to
week 52 were -0.87, -1.10 and -0.39 % in the  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and sitagliptin groups, respectively
(both  xxxd1951xxx  groups p \ 0.001 vs. sitagliptin; noninferiority criterion met). in the  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and
sitagliptin groups, 49, 58 and 33 % of patients, respectively, met the hba1c target of \7.0 % at 52 weeks (both
 xxxd1951xxx  groups p \ 0.001 vs. sitagliptin). compared
with placebo, at week 26  xxxd1951xxx  groups had significantly (p \ 0.001) greater lsm changes from baseline in
hba1c and greater proportions of patients met the hba1c
target of \7.0 % [9].
the award-6 trial (n = 599) evaluated the efficacy of
 xxxd1951xxx  1.5 mg once-weekly versus  xxxd2495xxx  1.8 mg
once-daily in patients with hba1c c7.0 % and b10.0 %
despite treatment with metformin [10]. the lsm changes
in hba1c from baseline to week 26 were -1.42 and
-1.36 % in the  xxxd1951xxx  and  xxxd2495xxx  groups (noninferiority criterion met). in both the  xxxd1951xxx  and  xxxd2495xxx  groups, 68 % met the hba1c target of \7.0 % at
week 26 [10].

2.3.4 in combination with metformin plus pioglitazone
the award-1 (n = 976) trial evaluated the efficacy of
 xxxd1951xxx  versus exenatide 10 lg twice-daily or placebo
in patients with a baseline hba1c between 7–11 % (on
oam monotherapy) or 7–10 % (on combination oam
therapy). during the lead-in period of the trial, all patients
were stabilized on maximum tolerated dosages of metformin plus pioglitazone and other oams were discontinued.
after treatment stabilization, patients with hba1c [6.5 %
were then randomized to  xxxd1951xxx  or exenatide therapy
[12]. the lsm changes in hba1c from baseline to week
26 were -1.30, -1.51 and -0.99 % in the  xxxd1951xxx 
0.75, 1.5 mg and exenatide groups, respectively, versus
-0.46 % in the placebo group (both  xxxd1951xxx  groups
p \ 0.001 vs. placebo and vs. exenatide; exenatide group
p \ 0.001 vs placebo). in the  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and
exenatide groups, 66, 78 and 52 % of patients met the
hba1c target of \7.0 % at week 26 (vs. 43 % in the placebo group; p \ 0.001 for both  xxxd1951xxx  groups vs.
placebo) [12].
2.3.5 in combination with insulin lispro
with or without metformin

2.3.3 in combination with metformin plus  xxxd2203xxx 
the award-2 trial (n = 807) evaluated the efficacy of
 xxxd1951xxx  versus once-daily  xxxd2362xxx  (titrated to
fasting glucose targets) in patients with type 2 diabetes
inadequately controlled with metformin plus  xxxd2203xxx 
(data are from an abstract) [11]. at week 52, the lsm
changes from baseline in hba1c were -0.76. -1.08 and
-0.63 % in the  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and  xxxd2362xxx  groups, respectively (noninferiority criterion met for
both dosages; p \ 0.001 vs.  xxxd2362xxx  for the  xxxd1951xxx  1.5 mg once-weekly group). at week 52, the
hba1c target of \7.0 % was met by 37, 53 and 31 % of
patients in the  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and  xxxd2362xxx 
groups, respectively (p \ 0.05 for  xxxd1951xxx  1.5 mg vs.
 xxxd2362xxx ) [11].

the award-4 trial (n = 884) evaluated the efficacy of
 xxxd1951xxx  versus  xxxd2362xxx  in patients whose type 2
diabetes was uncontrolled with conventional insulin therapy (hba1c c7.0 and b11.0 %); all patients received
insulin lispro three-times daily with or without metformin;
 xxxd2362xxx  and insulin lispro were titrated to achieve
glycaemic targets (data are from an abstract) [13]. the
lsm changes in hba1c from baseline to week 26 were
-1.59, -1.64 and -1.41 % in the  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg
and  xxxd2362xxx  groups (both  xxxd1951xxx  groups
p \ 0.05 vs.  xxxd2362xxx ; noninferiority criterion met).
at week 26, 69, 68 and 57 % of patients in the  xxxd1951xxx 
0.75, 1.5 mg and  xxxd2362xxx  groups met the hba1c
target of \7.0 % (both  xxxd1951xxx  groups p \ 0.05 vs.
 xxxd2362xxx ) [13].

2.4 adverse reactions
in pooled data from placebo-controlled trials, adverse
reactions occurring in c5 % of  xxxd1951xxx  0.75 mg

(n = 836) or 1.5 mg (n = 834) groups and at a higher rate
than in placebo groups (n = 568) were nausea (12.4 and
21.1 vs. 5.3 % with placebo), diarrhoea (8.9 and 12.6 vs.
6.7 %), vomiting (6.0 and 12.7 vs. 2.3 %), abdominal pain

m. sanford

(6.5 and 9.4 vs. 4.9 %), decreased appetite (4.9 and 8.6 vs.
1.6 %), dyspepsia (4.1 and 5.8 vs. 2.3 %) and fatigue (4.2
and 5.6 vs. 2.6 %) [3]. overall, gastrointestinal (gi) reactions occurred in 31.6, 41.0 and 21.3 % of  xxxd1951xxx  0.75,
1.5 mg and placebo recipients, respectively. in the corresponding groups, 1.3, 3.5 and 0.2 % of patients discontinued treatment because of gi adverse reactions. in the
 xxxd1951xxx  0.75 and 1.5 mg groups, most gi adverse
reactions were mild or moderate, with 7 and 11 % severe.
a similar pattern of adverse reactions was seen in pooled
analyses of placebo and active-comparator trials [3].
at week 26 in placebo-controlled trials in which  xxxd1951xxx  was added to metformin or to metformin plus
pioglitazone, symptomatic hypoglycaemia (serum glucose
 xxxg398xxx  mg/dl) occurred in b6 % of  xxxd1951xxx  recipients
and 1 % of placebo recipients (no cases of severe hypoglycaemia were observed). when administered with a
sulfonylurea, &40 % of  xxxd1951xxx  recipients had documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (severe in \ 1 % of
patients) and when administered with prandial insulin
80–85 % of  xxxd1951xxx  recipients had documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (severe in 2–3 %) [3].
a dose-duration-dependent increase in thyroid c-cell
tumours has been observed in male and female rats following lifetime exposure.[3] the relevance of this finding
to humans is unknown. one case of medullary thyroid
carcinoma has been reported in a patient treated with  xxxd1951xxx  whose calcitonin levels prior to treatment were
8-fold the upper limit of normal [3]. the us prescribing
information contains a black box warning about a possible
risk of thyroid c-cell tumours, noting that  xxxd1951xxx  is
contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history
of these tumours and in patients with multiple endocrine
neoplasia syndrome type 2 [3].
in clinical trials,  xxxd1951xxx  was associated with small
increases in mean heart rate (hr) (2–4 beats/min); longterm clinical effects of these increases in hr are unknown
[3]. sinus tachycardia, persistent sinus tachycardia, and
episodic sinus tachycardia with an increase in hr of c15
beats/min occurred more often in  xxxd1951xxx  than placebo
recipients; for instance, sinus tachycardia occurred in 2.8,
5.6 and 3.0 % of  xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and placebo
recipients, respectively.  xxxd1951xxx  recipients had mean
increase in the pr interval of 2–3 ms (vs. 0.9 ms with
placebo) and av block occurred in 1.7, 2.3 and 0.9 % of
 xxxd1951xxx  0.75, 1.5 mg and placebo recipients, respectively. in the corresponding groups, 2.5, 3.2 and 0.7 % of
patients had an increase in the pr interval to c220 ms [3].
in pooled data, 1.6 % of  xxxd1951xxx  recipients developed anti- xxxd1951xxx  antibodies. in 64 patients with antibodies, 34 had neutralizing antibodies and 36 (0.9 % of the
total population) had antibodies against native glp-1 [3].

injection site reactions occurred in 0.5 % of  xxxd1951xxx 
recipients and 0 % of placebo recipients [3]. in the four
phase ii and iii studies, systemic hypersensitivity adverse
reactions occurred in 0.5 % of  xxxd1951xxx  recipients [3].
other adverse reactions that may be of clinical relevance
include increases in lipase and/or  xxxg1789xxx , acute
pancreatitis, and acute renal failure or worsening of chronic
renal failure [3]. the us prescribing information contains
warnings related to these possible reactions and necessary
monitoring precautions [3].
2.5 ongoing clinical trials
the award programme includes three further ongoing
randomized, multinational trials. these are award-7
(nct01621178) comparing  xxxd1951xxx  plus insulin lispro
with  xxxd2362xxx  plus insulin lispro in patients with
type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease; award 8
(nct01769378) comparing  xxxd1951xxx  plus  xxxd2203xxx 
versus placebo plus  xxxd2203xxx  in patients receiving a
sulfonylurea; and award-9 (nct02152371) comparing
 xxxd1951xxx  plus insulin versus placebo plus insulin in
patients with poor glycaemic control despite insulin with or
without metformin [7].
the rewind (researching cardiovascular events
with a weekly incretin in diabetes) study (nct01394952)
is a randomized, placebo controlled trial of  xxxd1951xxx 
1.5 mg once-weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes with
hba1c of b9.5% who are receiving stable therapy for
diabetes and who are aged c50 years with established
clinical vascular disease, aged c55 years with subclinical
vascular disease, or aged c60 years with c2 cardiovascular risk factors [7]. the trial will evaluate the effect of
weekly  xxxd1951xxx  therapy for up to 8 years on cardiovascular endpoints, such as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetic retinopathy and chronic
renal replacement therapy.
two further trials are being conducted in japan:
(1) comparing  xxxd1951xxx  with  xxxd2362xxx 
(nct01584232) and (2) comparing  xxxd1951xxx  with  xxxd2495xxx  (nct01558271) in patients with type 2 diabetes
receiving oams [7].

3 current status
 xxxd1951xxx  received its first global approval on 18 september 2014 for use in adult patients with type 2 diabetes in
the usa and on 25 september 2014 it received a positive
opinion for use in adults with type 2 diabetes in the eu.
 xxxd1951xxx  can be used as monotherapy or in combination
with other regimens.
