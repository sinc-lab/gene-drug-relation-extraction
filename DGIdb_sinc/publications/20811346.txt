between  xxxd138xxx  and cyclosporine
r spence1, a mandagere1, db richards2, mh magee3, c dufton1 and r boinpally1
 xxxd138xxx  (abs), approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and administered as an oral dose
once daily, is an eta-selective endothelin receptor antagonist (era) and a potential substrate for cytochrome p450 (cyp)
3a4, organic anion–transporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx ), and p-glycoprotein (p-gp).  xxxd1781xxx  (csa), an inhibitor of
cyp3a4, p-gp, and  xxxg2163xxx , may be used concomitantly with abs. in this open-label, parallel-treatment study, 28 healthy
subjects received steady-state abs (5 mg q.d.) either alone or with steady-state csa (100–150 mg b.i.d.), and 24 other
subjects received steady-state csa either alone or with steady-state abs. in the presence of csa, abs maximum plasma
concentration (cmax) increased 1.5-fold, and area under the plasma concentration–time curve (auc)0–tau increased
twofold. marginal increases were observed for csa cmax (906 vs. 1,014 ng/ml) and auc0–tau (3.05 vs. 3.37 µg⋅h/ml) in the
presence of abs. frequent adverse events (aes) were headache and gastrointestinal disorders. the addition of abs to
steady-state csa appeared less tolerable as compared with the addition of csa to steady-state abs. a maximum abs dose
of 5 mg is recommended if it is coadministered with csa. no change in csa dose is recommended if it is coadministered
with abs.
 xxxd138xxx  (abs;  xxxd138xxx ,  xxxd138xxx ) is an eta-selective
endothelin receptor antagonist (era) that has been approved for
the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the united
states, the european union, canada, australia, and several other
countries. it is administered as an oral once-daily dose and is
rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation, with maximum
plasma concentration (cmax) observed at ~2 h after administration. both cmax and area under the plasma concentration–time
curve (auc) increase proportionally over the therapeutic range
of the drug. in contrast to sulfonamide-based eras ( xxxd358xxx 
and  xxxd3207xxx ), which are metabolized principally by the cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzyme system,1–3 abs is a  xxxd3029xxx –
based era that is metabolized primarily by phase ii hepatic
glucuronidation through several  xxxd3476xxx  glucuronosyltransferase enzymes.4,5 the glucuronide metabolite is inactive and relatively unstable, easily reverting to the parent drug at
physiological ph; its systemic exposure in plasma is <3% relative
to the parent abs.6 abs also undergoes oxidative metabolism to
a lesser extent,6 primarily by cyp3a4, to form 4-hydroxymethyl
 xxxd138xxx  (4-hma). 4-hma is the only active circulating
metabolite; however, with a systemic exposure of ~4% of parent
abs and a 64-fold lower binding affinity for the  xxxg676xxx  as
compared with the parent compound,6 it does not significantly

contribute to the pharmacological actions of abs. the parent
compound and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in
bile/feces and appear to undergo enterohepatic recycling. abs
has demonstrated no clinically relevant drug–drug interactions
with cyp substrates.4,7–9 in vitro studies have demonstrated that
abs is a weak substrate for the efflux transporter p-glycoprotein
(p-gp) and a possible substrate for the hepatic uptake transporter
organic anion–transporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx ).6,10 consistent
with this, coadministration of abs with ketoconazole, a strong
inhibitor of cyp3a4 and p-gp, resulted in a modest (~35%)
increase in abs exposure.11 in addition, a recent study of abs
coadministered with rifampin, a potent inducer of cyp3a4 and
an effective inhibitor of  xxxg2163xxx , demonstrated a transient increase
(slightly less than twofold) in systemic exposure of abs with
acute rifampin coadministration; however, no clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics (pk) of abs were observed
with steady-state rifampin coadministration,12 which further
suggests that abs is a substrate for  xxxg2163xxx .
 xxxd1781xxx  (csa) is an immunosuppressant that may
be used concomitantly with pulmonary arterial hypertension
therapies, particularly in those with connective tissue disease.
furthermore, calcineurin inhibitors, including csa, are widely
used in solid organ transplantation; however, calcineurin

i­ nhibitor–mediated nephrotoxicity can limit the success of
kidney transplantation. data from previous studies suggest
that eras may attenuate csa toxicity through reversal of csainduced renal vasoconstriction.13–15 however, the use of both
 xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd3207xxx  are contraindicated in conjunction
with csa because of the substantial increases in exposure of
these drugs when coadministered with csa.2,3,16
csa, which is extensively metabolized by the  xxxg590xxx  enzyme
system, affects multiple drug metabolism and transport pathways; specifically, it is an inhibitor of cyp3a4, p-gp, and other
active transport systems such as  xxxg2163xxx .17 given the complexity
of the effect of csa on drug metabolic and transport pathways,
this study evaluated the effect of csa on the steady-state pk of
abs and its metabolite, 4-hma. given the narrow therapeutic
index of csa, the effect of abs on the pk of steady-state csa was
also evaluated. in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated
that abs does not inhibit or induce cyp or  xxxd3476xxx 
glucuronosyltransferase metabolic pathways at clinically relevant
concentrations.4 in addition, it does not inhibit transporters such
as  xxxg2163xxx , ntcp,  xxxg15xxx , or  xxxg11xxx , nor does it induce changes
in the levels of the proteins  xxxg15xxx ,  xxxg11xxx , and p-gp.6 therefore,
administration of abs was not expected to alter the pk of csa.

demographics and baseline characteristics

twenty-eight healthy volunteers (age ± sd, 36 ± 9.0 years; body
mass index, 25.4 ± 2.70 kg/m2) were enrolled into treatment
arm ab (steady-state abs followed by coadministration of abs
and csa (figure 1); all the subjects completed the study. the
­majority (96.4%) of the subjects were male. all the subjects were
either caucasian (82.1%) or african american (17.9%).
twenty-four healthy volunteers (age, 36 ± 8.2 years; body mass
index, 25.4 ± 2.81 kg/m2) were enrolled into treatment arm cd
(steady-state csa followed by coadministration of csa and
abs (figure 1). all the subjects received at least one dose of the
study drug. of the total number of subjects, 16 (66.7%) subjects
completed the treatment, and 8 (33.3%) subjects discontinued
prematurely because of adverse events (aes). subjects in this
treatment group were male (100%) and either caucasian (87.5%)
or african american (12.5%). overall, ­demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable in subjects assigned to
treatment arms ab and cd.

to 125 mg b.i.d., and 23 subjects had their dosages titrated to
150 mg b.i.d. there were no further titrations.
all 24 subjects assigned to treatment arm cd started csa
dosing at 100 mg b.i.d. all the subjects had their csa dosages
titrated to 150 mg b.i.d. during the first titration. one subject
was subsequently downtitrated to 125 mg b.i.d. because of excess
csa trough level. of the 24 subjects enrolled, 16 received a total
of six planned daily doses of abs (5 mg). of the 8 subjects who
did not receive all the doses of abs, 2 discontinued prematurely
before receiving any dose of abs, 4 subjects received two doses
each, and 2 subjects received three doses each.

dosing

an abs dose of 5 mg was selected for this study to allow for a
potential increase in abs exposure with coadministration of
csa. a target csa trough concentration of 150–200 ng/ml was
selected because this is the target range in routine clinical use.
a starting csa dosage of 100 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) with two
separate dose titrations was incorporated into the study to allow
for variability in exposure of csa. for reasons of safety/tolerability, the total daily csa dosage was limited to 300 mg/day
(150 mg b.i.d.).
all 28 subjects in treatment arm ab received a total of 14
planned daily doses of abs (5 mg). subjects started csa dosing at 100 mg b.i.d.; 5 subjects had their csa dosages titrated

pharmacokinetics
treatment arm ab: steady-state abs followed by coadministration of abs
and csa. steady state was determined for both abs and 4-hma

prior to assessing the pk of abs alone. in addition, steady-state
concentrations of abs, its metabolite, and csa were attained
before assessing the pk of abs in the presence of csa.
in order to evaluate the potential acute effect of csa on the
steady-state pk of abs and 4-hma, a time-matched comparison was carried out between the concentrations of abs and
its metabolite at steady state in the absence of csa (day 4) vs.
the concentrations in the presence of csa but prior to steadystate csa (days 6 and 7). figure 2 shows that the mean abs

the steady-state geometric mean cmax for abs increased from
421 ng/ml to 624 ng/ml (48% increase) in the presence of steadystate csa (table 1). the steady-state auc0–tau for abs increased
from 2,952 ng·h/ml to 6,535 ng·h/ml (a more than twofold
increase) because of the effect of csa. furthermore, minimum
plasma concentration (cmin) increased ~3.4-fold in the presence
of csa as compared with abs administered alone. the apparent
terminal half-life of abs was marginally increased (from 8.4 to
11.5 h) in the presence of csa; however, given the magnitude of
the standard deviations (table 1), this is unlikely to represent
a true difference.
plasma concentrations of 4-hma were also higher in the
presence of csa. the cmax of 4-hma increased 23% (table 1),
and auc0–tau increased from 134 ng·h/ml to 190 ng·h/ml (42%)

 xxxd138xxx  concentration (ng/ml)

concentrations in plasma on days 6 and 7, after initial dosing
with csa in combination with abs, were higher than after
steady-state abs alone. the geometric mean of the auc0–tau values for abs on days 4, 6, and 7 were 3,109, 4,360, and 4,907 ng·h/
ml, respectively. a comparison of the geometric mean ratios
for the auc0–tau of abs on day 4 vs. days 6 and 7 demonstrated
that abs exposures increased markedly (40% on day 6 and 58%
on day 7) immediately after coadministration. in contrast, the
abs cmax values were similar in the absence and presence of
csa. increased exposure was not observed for the metabolite,
4-hma, in the presence of csa (data not shown).
in agreement with the results in previous reports,7–9 abs
was rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation, in both the
absence and presence of csa (table 1). figure 3 shows that abs
concentrations at steady state were higher in the presence of
csa at steady state (day 14) than in the absence of csa (day 5).

in the presence of steady-state csa. on the basis of individual
metabolite-to-parent exposure (auc0–tau) ratios, there appears
to be a slight decrease in the relative exposure of metabolite:
mean (±sd) was 4.8 ± 1.82% for steady-state abs alone and
3.3 ± 1.94% in the presence of steady-state csa.
treatment arm cd: steady-state csa followed by coadministration of
csa and abs. steady state was attained for csa alone prior to

assessing its pk. subsequently, steady state was maintained for
csa, and steady states of abs and 4-hma were attained prior
to the evaluation of csa pk in the presence of abs.
figure 4 shows that the mean steady-state csa whole-blood
concentration–time profiles were similar for csa alone (day 8)
and in the presence of steady-state abs (day 14). peak concentrations of csa were reached in ~1.5 h, whether in the absence
or presence of abs (table 2). the steady-state geometric mean
cmax of csa increased (by 12%) from 906 ng/ml to 1,014 ng/­ml
in the presence of steady-state abs (table 2). although the
average cmin of csa (table 2) was below the trough target of
150–200 ng/ml, the increases observed for cmin of csa in the
presence of abs were of a similar magnitude (18%) to those
seen for cmax. steady-state geometric mean auc0–tau for csa
increased ~10% when administered in combination with steadystate abs. the apparent mean whole-blood terminal half-life of
csa increased slightly in the presence of abs.
in addition to the pharmacokinetic assessments described
above, trough and approximate peak concentrations of csa were
assessed on day 9 vs. day 10 (the first 2 days of coadministration
of abs and csa) with minimal changes, suggesting that there is
no acute effect of abs on the pk of csa.

this treatment arm, with twice as many subjects experiencing
a headache after coadministration of abs and csa as compared with abs alone (table 3). aside from headache, no ae
occurred in more than 2 subjects, and all aes reported were
considered mild.
all 24 subjects enrolled into treatment arm cd received at
least one dose of csa; however, 2 subjects did not receive a dose
of abs, and their data were not included in the safety summary
for the combination treatment period. as in treatment arm ab,
headache was the most frequent ae when csa was administered
first, with a substantially greater number of subjects reporting a
headache after coadministration of csa and abs as compared
with csa alone (table 3). the more common aes in treatment
arm cd were experienced by a greater percentage of subjects
after coadministration of csa and abs than after csa alone.
most of these aes were mild (75% after csa alone and 63%
after csa + abs). however, one subject experienced a mild ae
of pharyngeal hemorrhage after receiving csa alone (150 mg
b.i.d.). this event, along with mild abdominal pain, led to discontinuation of csa in this subject. the subject was admitted to
the hospital, qualifying the event as a serious ae. all laboratory
findings and vital signs for this subject stayed within normal
limits. a nasopharyngeal cause was assessed to be the most likely
origin of bleeding. this event was considered resolved on the
day of hospitalization, and the subject’s epigastric abdominal
pain improved after treatment for helicobacter pylori infection.
another subject who experienced a moderate headache after
administration of csa alone prematurely discontinued the study
before receiving any dose of abs. in addition, six subjects discontinued the study prematurely because of at least one ae after
administration of two or three doses of abs concurrent with
csa at steady state; mild and moderate aes of upper abdominal

pain, headache, vomiting, and nausea were the most common

overall, the incidence and types of aes were similar in the
two treatment arms; twice as many aes occurred during the
coadministration treatment periods as compared with treatments with either abs alone or csa alone. both abs and csa
are associated with reductions in hematocrit and hemoglobin
levels.4,18 a trend toward lower hematocrit and hemoglobin
­levels was observed during the coadministration, but this
did not reach clinical significance. no clinically significant
changes in electrocardiogram, vital sign parameters, or physical examination findings were observed during either treatment
regimen.
discussion

csa is a known inhibitor of cyp3a4, p-gp, and  xxxg2163xxx , and
it may therefore affect the pk of numerous compounds that
are substrates of these enzymes/transporters. because abs is
metabolized to 4-hma mainly by cyp3a4, and because abs
is a possible substrate for the hepatic uptake transporter  xxxg2163xxx 

and for the gut efflux transporter p-gp, it was important to
­investigate the potential drug–drug interaction(s) of the abs–
csa combination.
given that hepatic glucuronidation and biliary excretion of
parent drug and metabolite(s) are the major routes of excretion
of abs from the body, the 2.2-fold increase in auc0–tau after
abs alone, with a smaller relative change in cmax when coadministered with csa, is suggestive of csa-mediated inhibition
of hepatic uptake transporters (possibly through  xxxg2163xxx ) and/
or ­biliary excretion through efflux transporters (such as p-gp)
rather than cyp3a4-metabolic inhibition. this hypothesis is
consistent with the modest increase in abs exposure observed
in the presence of ketoconazole, a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor.11
these observations are inconsistent with csa-mediated inhibition of p-gp being the primary cause for the significant increase
in abs exposure seen in this study; however, one cannot dismiss the possibility that such inhibition could offer a partial
explanation for the observed rise in abs levels. furthermore,
the transient increase in abs exposure with acute rifampin
coadministration12 suggests that csa-mediated  xxxg2163xxx  inhibition may have contributed to the results observed in this study.
although the effect of csa on the pk of abs is clinically relevant, it is notable that the magnitude of the change is much lower
than both the 30-fold increase observed after the first day of
coadministration of csa with  xxxd358xxx  and the fourfold exposure increase observed after steady-state coadministration.2,19
interestingly, the marked increases in  xxxd358xxx  exposure when
coadministered with csa have been largely attributed to the
inhibition of  xxxg2163xxx  by csa.19,20 additional mechanistic studies
are needed to elucidate the exact role of various transporters in
the systemic clearance of abs.
a slight increase in 4-hma exposure was also observed in
the presence of csa; however, the increase in metabolite exposure was much lower than that for the parent compound, and a
decrease in the metabolite-to-parent auc0–tau ratio was observed
in the presence of csa (4.8% vs. ~3.3%). this suggests that, in
the presence of csa, abs metabolism is reduced; this too is
supportive of the theory that a csa-mediated reduction in
hepatic uptake of abs occurs when less abs is available for
metabolism.
although both men and women were eligible to participate
in this study, it is notable that the subject population consisted
overwhelmingly of men. it has been reported that, relative to
men, women have a higher systemic clearance of cyp3a4 substrates administered intravenously; however, gender-related
differences in the apparent clearance of cyp3a4 substrates
administered orally have generally not been reported.21 this
observation is supported by the finding that no gender-related
differences in cyp3a4 expression were observed in the small
intestine.22 additionally, studies have demonstrated that there
are no significant differences between men and women with
regard to either hepatic or intestinal p-gp levels.22,23 in view of
the results of previous studies, and given the fact that abs is a
dual cyp3a4/p-gp substrate that is administered orally (with
cyp3a4 contributing minimally to its metabolism), the results
of this study should be applicable to women also.

in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that abs
neither inhibits nor induces cyp or  xxxd3476xxx  glucuronosyltransferase metabolic pathways at clinically relevant
concentrations, nor does abs inhibit  xxxg2163xxx , ntcp,  xxxg15xxx , or
 xxxg11xxx .6,10 consistent with these findings, the coadministration
of abs with csa in our study did not substantially alter the
pk of csa. the steady-state cmax and auc of csa increased
marginally (~12% and 10%, respectively) when csa was coadministered with abs. the slight increase in the exposure of csa
is unlikely to be clinically relevant.
the aes experienced by subjects during this study are predictable, on the basis of the known profiles of abs and csa.4,18
headaches and gastrointestinal disorders, as well as downward
shifts in hematology parameters, were observed more often after
coadministration of abs and csa than after abs alone. it is
important to note that the incidence of aes was greater when
abs was added to csa treatment rather than when csa was
added to abs treatment. this may be associated with a more
rapid achievement of maximum abs exposure, as opposed to
receiving a lower abs exposure prior to the increase. greater
drug-related side effects have been observed when era exposure is increased too rapidly without uptitration.2 given the relatively small number of subjects in this study, it is not possible to
draw definitive conclusions.
the increase in abs exposure caused by csa is manageable
through adjustment of the abs dose. in view of the approximately twofold increase in abs exposure when it is coadministered with csa, the dosage of abs should be limited to 5 mg
once daily for such a coadministration. however, no csa dose
adjustment is warranted when it is administered in combination with abs.
methods

subjects. men and women 18–55 years of age, with body mass index

of 18.5–29.9 and body weight ≥50 kg, who were in good health were
eligible for this study. women were required to be surgically sterile or
postmenopausal to be eligible for inclusion. the inclusion criteria were
normal cardiovascular function, normal hematology and chemistry
tests, and negative results for drug and alcohol use at screening and
at baseline. other key requirements for enrollment were that subjects
should avoid the intake of caffeine, alcohol, grapefruit, and foods that
potentially interfere with cyp and/or  xxxd3476xxx  glucuronosyltransferase metabolic enzymes, from 7 days before treatment up
to discharge; refrain from taking prescription medications, over-thecounter medications, and herbal remedies from 14 days before treatment up to discharge; and undergo no vaccinations from 30 days prior
to treatment up to the follow-up visit.
subjects were excluded from participation in the study if they had a
history of angina, arrhythmia, hypotension or hypertension, sickle cell
disease, anemia, or any bleeding disorder; any clinical condition deemed
unsuitable for study compliance; and/or known hypersensitivity to abs
or csa (neoral). all volunteers provided written informed consent prior
to enrollment in the study.
study design. eligible subjects were enrolled to one of two parallel-

t­ reatment arms: ab and cd. subjects entered the clinical facility on day
1 and were confined therein for the duration of the treatment (16 days/15
nights and 15 days/14 nights for ab and cd, respectively). subjects
returned for a follow-up visit 8–10 days after discharge (figure 1).
treatment arm ab: treatment a consisted of 5 days of 5 mg abs once
daily. on day 5, after a fast, subjects received the dose followed by a 24-h

pharmacokinetic assessment of abs and 4-hma. treatment b started
on day 6 and consisted of abs 5 mg once daily in addition to 100 mg (4 ×
25 mg capsules) csa b.i.d. on the basis of csa trough concentrations on
the mornings of days 8 and 10, the csa doses for individual subjects were
titrated by ±25 mg to target a csa trough level of 150–200 ng/ml. the csa
dosage was limited to a maximum of 300 mg/day (150 mg b.i.d.). on days
11–13, subjects continued to receive a 5 mg dose of abs in the morning,
in addition to the day 10 evening dose of csa b.i.d. on day 14, after a fast,
the subjects received 5 mg abs in the morning in addition to the day 10
evening dose of csa b.i.d. a 24-h pk assessment of abs and 4-hma
was carried out after the morning doses. the subjects were discharged
on day 15 after completion of all study procedures and collection of the
final pharmacokinetic sample.
treatment arm cd: treatment c consisted of 8 days of csa dosing
b.i.d. on days 1 and 2, subjects were administered 100 mg (4 × 25 mg
capsules) csa b.i.d. on the basis of csa trough concentrations on the
mornings of days 3 and 5, the csa dose was titrated ±25 mg to target a
csa trough level of 150–200 ng/ml; csa administration was limited to a
maximum dosage of 300 mg/day (150 mg b.i.d.). on days 6 and 7, subjects
continued to receive the day 5 evening dose of csa b.i.d. on day 8, fasted
subjects continued to receive the day 5 evening dose of csa followed by
a 12-h pharmacokinetic assessment of csa. treatment d consisted of
6 days (days 9–14) of 5 mg abs once daily in addition to csa at the day
5 evening dose (b.i.d., except on day 14 when only the morning dose of
csa was administered). on day 14, after a fast, subjects received morning
doses of abs and csa, followed by a 12-h pharmacokinetic assessment of
csa. the subjects were discharged on day 14 after completion of all study
procedures and collection of the final pharmacokinetic blood sample.
when abs and csa were administered on the same day, abs was
given at the same time as the morning dose of csa.
this study was approved by the independent investigational review
board (plantation, fl) and was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the declaration of helsinki and the international conference of
harmonisation.
analytical methods and pharmacokinetic assessments

treatment arm ab: plasma samples for the determination of abs and
4-hma concentrations were collected at the following time points:
on day 3, before administration of the dose; on days 4, 6, and 7, before
the dose and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after the dose; on days 5 and 14,
before the dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and
24 h after the dose. in addition, on days 8–13, predose and 2-h postdose
(approximate time point for cmax) blood samples were collected for the
determination of abs and 4-hma concentrations. on days 8 and 10,
whole-blood samples were collected for on-site determination of csa
concentrations, within 30 min prior to the morning dose. in addition,
blood samples were collected on days 12–14 before the dose and at 2 h
after the morning dose (approximate time point of cmax) so as to assess
csa concentrations.
treatment arm cd: on days 3 and 5, whole-blood samples were
­collected for on-site determination of csa concentrations, within 30 min
prior to the morning dose. blood samples for the determination of csa
concentrations were collected at the following times: on days 6 and 7 and
9–13, before the dose and at 2 h after the morning dose (approximate time
point of cmax) and on days 8 and 14, before the dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5,
2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the dose. in addition, on days 12–14,
plasma samples for the determination of abs and 4-hma concentrations
were collected before dosing.
whole-blood samples for csa analysis were collected in tubes containing k3-edta, immediately mixed by gentle inversion to prevent
coagulation, and stored at −20 °c until being processed. blood samples
for abs analysis were collected in tubes containing sodium citrate, immediately mixed by gentle inversion to prevent coagulation, and placed on
ice prior to centrifugation. the samples were centrifuged at 1,500g for
15 min at 4 °c ≤30 min after collection to separate plasma from cells, and
stored at −20 °c until analysis. concentrations of csa, abs, and 4-hma
were measured using validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass

spectrometry methods at amdequant (colorado springs, co). plasma
concentrations of abs and its metabolite were determined as previously
reported.8 the precision of the abs assay was ±15%, as indicated by the
percentage coefficient of variation, and the accuracy of the assay was
within ±15% of the actual value for abs. the quantification limit was
set at 1.0 ng/ml for abs and at 0.2 ng/ml for 4-hma.
whole-blood concentrations of csa were determined using
cyclosporin d (lkt laboratories, st paul, mn)) as an internal standard, calibration standards, and qc samples with each sample set. csa
was extracted from 0.25 ml of whole blood by precipitating proteins with
0.5 ml of acetonitrile and centrifuged at 12,000 r.p.m. the supernatant
was injected into a perkin elmer sciex api 3000 (concord, ontario,
canada) mass analyzer using a c18 hplc column. quantitation was
carried out using the positive-ionization mode with transition masses
of 1,219.9 and 1,202.8 for csa and 1,233.9 and 1,216.8 for the internal
standard. the csa calibration curve ranged from 5 ng/ml to 1,500 ng/ml.
the precision of the assay was within ±15%, as indicated by the percentage coefficient of variation, and the accuracy was within ±15% of the
actual concentration.
pk analyses were performed using noncompartmental methods in
winnonlin-pro version 5.2 (pharsight, palo alto, ca). pk parameters
included auc during the dosing interval, using the linear-log ­trapezoidal
rule, where tau is equal to the dosing interval (auc0–tau), cmax, time to maximum concentration, and apparent terminal half-life, calculated as 0.693/
lambdaz, where lambdaz is the apparent elimination rate constant. actual elapsed time
relative to dosing was used for all parameter estimations. if lambdaz could not
be determined, or if the calculated r2 value for lambdaz was <0.8, terminal
half-life was not estimated.
safety assessments. aes were monitored throughout the study.

electrocardiograms, vital signs, and urinalysis were performed at screening, day −1, discharge, and follow-up. in addition, clinical laboratory
measurements and vital signs were measured at pre-specified times
throughout both treatment sequences.

of csa was assessed from predose and approximate peak (2 h after the
morning dose) whole-blood concentrations of csa on day 9 as compared
with the corresponding concentrations on day 10. in addition, trough
plasma abs and 4-hma concentration values and trough whole-blood
csa concentration values were used to assess the attainment of steady
state. steady-state assessments were conducted using analysis of variance,
where the lower bound of the 90% confidence intervals of the contrasts
(e.g., day 3 vs. the average of days 4 and 5) was compared with the 80%
equivalence criterion. all statistical analyses were conducted using sas
software, version 8.2 or higher (sas institute, cary, nc).

statistical analyses. the safety population consisted of all subjects who

received treatment with at least one dose of either study drug (abs and/or
csa). safety data were summarized using descriptive methods, including
n, mean, sd, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous measures, and counts and percentage of subjects for categorical parameters.
descriptive statistics were used for demographics, baseline characteristics, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests.
the pk evaluable population for treatment arm ab consisted of all
subjects who received study drug regimens a and b and had sufficient
plasma concentration data for assessment of abs cmax and auc0–tau after
treatments a and b. the pk evaluable population for treatment arm cd
consisted of all subjects who received study drug regimens c and d and
had sufficient whole-blood concentration data for assessment of csa
cmax and auc0–tau after treatments c and d. pk parameters were calculated by means of noncompartmental methods using winnonlin (version
5.2; pharsight, mountain view, ca) and summarized descriptively. a
mixed-effects analysis of variance was applied to log-transformed para­
meters for inferential analysis with fixed effect as the relevant treatment
(a and b or c and d) and the subject as a random effect. on the basis
of these models, auc0–tau, cmax, and cmin were described by geometric
mean ratios for the primary analysis, which compared treatment b to a
and treatment c to d. point estimates and two-sided 90% confidence
intervals were used to determine the effect of each of the study drugs
on the pk of the other: if a confidence interval was contained within
the predefined no-effect range of 80% to 125%, it was concluded that no
clinically relevant drug–drug interaction occurred.24 although the primary analysis was based on the hypothesis of equivalent bioavailability,
a post hoc analysis was performed to test the hypothesis of equal means,
using the same mixed-effects analysis of variance with a two-sided test.
in order to evaluate the acute effect of csa on abs, the cmax and auc0–tau
values of abs and its metabolite on days 6 and 7 were compared with
those on day 4 for treatment ab. the initial effect of abs on the pk
