background: chiral local anesthetics, such as ropivacaine and
 xxxd2468xxx , have the potential advantage over racemic
mixtures in showing reduced toxic side effects. however, these
s-(levo, or “ⴚ”)isomers also have reportedly lower potency
than their optical antipode, possibly resulting in no advantage
in therapeutic index. potency for local anesthetics inhibiting
naⴙ channels or action potentials depends on the pattern of
membrane potential and so also does the stereopotency ratio.
here the authors have quantitated the stereopotencies of r-, s-,
and racemic  xxxd383xxx , comparing several in vitro assays of
neuronal naⴙ channels with those from in vivo functional
nerve block, to establish relative potencies and to understand
better the role of different modes of channel inhibition in
overall functional anesthesia.
methods: the binding of  xxxd383xxx  to naⴙ channels was
assessed indirectly by its antagonism of [3h]-batrachotoxin
binding to rat brain synaptosomes. inhibition of naⴙ currents
by  xxxd383xxx  was directly assayed in voltage-clamped gh-3
neuroendocrine cells. neurobehavioral functions were disrupted by  xxxd383xxx  percutaneously injected (0.1 ml; 0.0625–
1.0%) at the rat sciatic nerve and semiquantitatively assayed.

acaine were compared for their magnitude and duration of
action.
results: competitive batrachotoxin displacement has a stereopotency ratio of r:s ⴝ 3:1. inhibition of naⴙ currents with
different prepulse potentials shows that s > r potency when
the membrane is hyperpolarized, and r > s potency when it is
depolarized from normal resting values. functional deficits assayed in vivo usually demonstrate no consistent enantioselectivity and only a modest stereopotency (r:s ⴝ 1.2–1.3) for peak
analgesia achieved at the lowest doses. other functions display
no significant stereopotency in either the degree, the duration,
or their product (area under the curve) at any dose.
conclusion: although the in vitro actions of  xxxd383xxx 
showed stereoselectivity ratios of 1.3–3:1 (r:s), in vivo nerve
block at clinically used concentrations showed much smaller
ratios for peak effect and no significant enantioselectivity for
duration. a primary role for the blockade of resting rather than
open or inactivated naⴙ channels may explain the modest stereoselectivity in vivo, although stereoselective factors controlling local disposition cannot be ruled out. levo-(sⴚ) xxxd383xxx  is
effectively equipotent to r- or racemic  xxxd383xxx  in vivo for rat
sciatic nerve block. (key words: action potential; local anesthetic; sodium channel; state-dependence; stereopotency.)

the development of chiral local anesthetics, such as
ropivacaine and  xxxd2468xxx , was a response to reports of cardiovascular collapse after accidental intravenous injections of racemic  xxxd383xxx .1 both of these
chiral compounds, s-stereoisomers of closely related piperidine local anesthetics, are reported to have reduced
cardiotoxicity compared with the racemic mixture or
the r-isomer.2,3 however, these s-enantiomers are also
reported to be less potent than their r- counterparts,4
and, if equal clinical actions require higher doses, the
apparent advantage of reduced toxicity observed at a
lower dose might be offset with no gain in therapeutic
index.
the primary action of local anesthetics on the peripheral nervous system is a blockade of nerve impulses
resulting from direct binding of these drugs to neuronal
sodium channels. this action has some, albeit weak,
stereoselectivity. for the stereoisomers of  xxxd383xxx ,

in vitro and in vivo actions of  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers

the dextro-(r⫺)enantiomer is slightly more potent than
the levo-(s⫺)enantiomer for tonic block and increasingly
more potent for the phasic block of nerve impulses
in vitro.4 this observation implies that functional local
anesthetic activity of dextro- and  xxxd2468xxx  in
vivo might also be different.
peripheral nerve fibers conduct trains of impulses at
different frequencies to accomplish the functional transmission of information. trains of efferent impulses in
motor fibers lead to smoothly developing, sustainable
muscle contractions and trains of afferent impulses in
both myelinated and nonmyelinated fibers conduct information about intensity, rate of change, and duration
of sensory input to the central nervous system. highfrequency impulses are both more sensitive to local
anesthetic (la) blockade and, important here, display
greater stereoselectivity. if such phasic block accounts
for functional losses during anesthesia in vivo, then a
relatively larger stereopotency will be present, but if
tonic block with little use-dependent contribution occurs in vivo, then the functional stereopotency will be
small.
in this study we have extended earlier observations by
using additional in vitro tests and also have conducted
in vivo nerve block studies. the original assay of impulse blockade was complemented by experiments testing the competitive displacement of radiolabeled batrachotoxin (3h-btx) from the na⫹ channels in rat brain
synaptosomes. direct actions on na⫹ channels were
measured by inhibition of voltage-clamped na⫹ current
in clonal neuroendocrine (gh-3) cells.
in these electrophysiological experiments, several
mechanistic questions are addressed, including whether
there is stereoselectivity for the “tonic” inhibition of
infrequently stimulated channels, as in nerves at rest,
how such stereoselectivity depends on the resting
(“holding”) membrane potential, and if the use-dependent inhibition that results during frequent depolarization of the membrane, as would occur during a train of
action potentials, demonstrates stereoselectivity. variations of use-dependent test protocols also are applied to
reveal the kinetic basis for increased drug affinity of
inactivated channel states and, importantly, a mechanism for the previously reported stereoselectivity of cardiac actions. altogether, the diverse assays provide a
comprehensive approach to assess the na⫹ channelrelated pharmacodynamics of  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers
and of the racemic mixture.
to compare their functional effectiveness, we examined the actions of  xxxd383xxx  stereoisomers and their

racemic mixture on neurobehavioral assays in rats. this
involves semiquantitative assessment of changes in neurologic responses that are reversible and dose-dependent.5 by comparing the actions of drugs on isolated
tissues and cells in vitro with the neurobehavioral results in vivo, one is able to separate local disposition
from neuronal pharmacodynamic influences for the percutaneous block of sciatic nerve used here.

methods
in vitro assays
batrachotoxin binding experiments. the ability of
 xxxd383xxx  enantiomers to displace 3h-btx from na⫹
channels was assayed with a technique adapted from
creveling et al.6 as described in mchugh et al.7 incubations were conducted in a total volume of 250 ␮l containing synaptosomes at a final concentration of 0.8 ␮g
total protein/␮l, 50 nm 3h- xxxd360xxx  (50 ci/mmol), 1 ␮m
tetrodotoxin, 0.03 mg leiurus quinquestriatus venom,
dissolved in synaptosome storage buffer, composed of
130 mm choline 䡠 cl, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.4 mm kcl, 0.8 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , 50 mm hepes, ph adjusted to 7.4 with  xxxd3449xxx 
(⬇ 22 mm). incubations for 30 min at 37°c were terminated by dilution of the reaction mixture with 3 ml of
wash buffer (163 mm choline cl, 5 mm hepes, 1.8 mm
cacl2, and 0.8 mm  xxxd2534xxx , ph adjusted to 7.4 with tris
base) and filtered through whatman gf/c filters (whatman international ltd., maidstone, england). filtration
was accomplished by vacuum perfusion through a 10sample filtration device (unipore model 25; biorad laboratories, richmond, ca). each filter was washed three
times with wash buffer at 0°c (1 ml/wash, approximately several seconds per wash). filters and filtrate
were counted in 15 ml of aquasol-2 (dupont-nen, boston, ma) on a beckman scintillation counter (model
ls6800; beckman, inc., palo alto, ca). the counting
efficiency was approximately 35%. nonspecific binding
was determined by parallel experiments in the presence
of 300 ␮m veratridine. specific binding was approximately 75% of total binding at 50 nm 3h- xxxd360xxx  (kd ⬇ 82
nm in 1 ␮m leiurus quinquestriatus toxin; kd of leiurus
quinquestriatus for enhancement of 3h- xxxd360xxx  binding ⫽ 35 nm8).
scorpion venom was prepared as described by wang
and strichartz.9 briefly, 5 mg/ml dry weight of lyophilized venom was incubated overnight in synaptosome
storage buffer (see above) at 4°c and spun at 20,000g for
15 min to pellet the undissolved mucopolysaccharide.

the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was then
used as a 5-mg nominal protein/ml solution of scorpion
venom.
preparation of synaptosomes. synaptosomes were
prepared using a method adapted from dodd et al.10 a
sheep (white-faced dorset-ewes, 40 – 60 kg) was killed
using a barbiturate overdose according to a protocol
approved by the harvard university standing committee
on animals for dr. hal feldman. the cerebral cortex was
harvested (5 g wet weight) and placed in 200 ml of 0.32
m sucrose at 0°c. three- to four-gram sections were
placed in 30 ml of 0.32 m sucrose at 0°c and were
homogenized in a teflon/glass homogenizer (fisher scientific, woburn, ma; clearance ⬇ 0.15– 0.23 mm, 12
up-and-down strokes at 800 rpm) while the mortar of the
homogenizer was kept in an ice–water bath. the crude
homogenates were pooled and distributed as 20-ml aliquots into polycarbonate centrifuge bottles. these were
centrifuged at 5,100 rpm (1,500g) on a 70.1 ti rotor for
12 min at 4°c in a beckman l-80 preparative ultracentrifuge (palo alto, ca). the pellet (p1) was discarded.
the supernatant (nominally in 0.32 m sucrose) was removed, layered onto 8 ml of 1.2 m sucrose at 0°c, and
spun at 50,000 rpm (170,000g) for 17 min on a 70.1 ti
rotor at 4°c. four milliliters of supernatant was removed
from the gradient interface and mixed with 10 ml of 0.32
m sucrose at 0°c. the pellet (p2) and other material was
discarded. the diluted interface was layered onto 8 ml of
0.8 m sucrose and spun at 50,000 rpm for 17 min on a
70.1 ti rotor. the supernatant was discarded and the
pellets (p3) were resuspended in synaptosomal storage
buffer. the synaptosomes were snap frozen in 250-␮l
aliquots on ethanol– dry ice and stored at ⫺80°c. storage
of synaptosomes in a similar fashion has been shown to
have little effect on toxin binding or na⫹ flux.11 total
protein concentration was measured to be 3.41 mg/ml

whole cell voltage clamp of naⴙ currents. the
gh-3 cell line was purchased from american type culture collection (rockville, md) and maintained as described by dubinsky and oxford.13 cells were kept in a
humidified incubator at 37°c under 5% co2 and 95% air.
cells were replated to a lower density every 7 days in
35-mm culture dishes. the culture medium (89% dulbecco’s eagle medium, gibco brl #11965, life technologies, gaithersburg, md; 10% fetal calf serum, hyclone,

gibco brl, #15140) was replaced every 3– 4 days. cells
were used for experiments at days 1–5 after replating.
na⫹ currents in gh3 cells were recorded at room
temperature (23 ⫾ 2°c) using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp method.14 patch pipettes were
pulled from borosilicate glass tubes (tw150f-3, world
precision instruments, sarasota, fl) and heat polished at
the tip before use to give a resistance of 1 ⫾ 0.5 m⍀.
currents were recorded using an axopatch 200a
patch clamp amplifier (axon instruments, foster city,
ca), filtered with a 4-pole low-pass bessel filter at 2–5
hz, and digitized at 20 khz (tl-1, dma interface, axon
instruments). all experiments were conducted under
capacitance and series resistance compensation, leakage
current was subtracted by the p/4 method7 with exception of the experiments for phasic inhibition. pclamp
6.0 software (axon instruments) was used for acquisition and analysis of currents. microcal origin software
(microcal software, northampton, ma) was used for
creating figures and applying fitting procedures.
experiments were performed with external solution
containing 130 mm nacl, 0.1 mm cacl2, 5 mm kcl, 5 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm hepes (adjusted to ph 7.4
with naoh), and internal solution containing 110 mm
csf, 10 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm egta, 10 mm
hepes (adjusted to ph 7.2 with csoh). control solutions as well as test solutions were applied to cells with
a multiple-barrel perfusion system. r(⫹)- and s(⫺)- xxxd383xxx  were obtained as crystalline hcl salts from
chiroscience, ltd. (cambridge, united kingdom) and
dissolved in water to give 50-mm stock solutions.
in vivo assay
neurobehavioral experiments. neurobehavioral
experiments were performed on male sprague-dawley
rats, weighing 250 –300 g (age, 10 –12 weeks). all procedures were approved by the harvard committee on
animals and are in accordance with published guidelines
for animal experimentation of the international association for the study of pain. rats were delivered at an age
of 40 days and were handled daily over the next 10 –14
days. the goal of handling is to familiarize the animal
with the experimenter, the environments in which the
studies are conducted, the manipulations involved in the
neurologic evaluation, and the injection procedure.5
this familiarization minimizes the contamination from
stress response during the experiment and improves
experimental performance. criteria for sufficient handling were an absence of signs of behavioral stress (absence of locomotor freezing and decreased number of

fecal boli in the open field) and somatic stress (a regular
gain in weight) and a lack of response to the tactile
(non-noxious) stimulation of the area to be tested, followed by a robust, distinctive response to noxious stimulation. animals that did not meet all criteria were not
used in this study.
general behavioral reactions, indicating the mental
status of the animals, were monitored throughout the
observation period under free behavior conditions, observed in a 1 ⫻ 1-m uncovered box. mental status was
considered normal when the animal was responsive to
its environment and exhibited exploratory activity.
these behavioral aspects are known to be altered by
systemic (toxic) local anesthetics.5,15 all solutions were
prepared on the day of the experiment, not more than
30 min before injection.
regional block. an experiment consisted of monitoring the specific neural functions, mediated by the sciatic
nerve of either hind limb: proprioception, motor function, and nociception before and after injection of drug
close to the sciatic nerve of one limb.5 the noninjected
limb served as a control for evaluation of neurologic
changes. time intervals for testing were 1, 5, 15 min, and
every 15 min until 2 h after the injection, and thereafter
every 30 min until functions were fully recovered.
a total of 142 experiments were performed on 71 rats.
the following drugs were injected, all in 0.1-ml volumes:

assessment of sciatic nerve functions. the order
of testing was always as follows: proprioception, motor
function, nocifension.5 the evaluation of proprioception
was based on quantification of the “hopping” and “tactile placing” reactions. hopping tests the ability to do
passive lateral movement; tactile placing is testing of the
ability to reposition the knuckled toes. the functional
status was graded as follows: 3 (normal), 2 (slightly
impaired), 1 (severely impaired), or 0 (absent).
motor function was evaluated by the extensor postural
thrust (measured in grams with a platform balance) as
the force that resists contact of the platform by the heel.
normal motor function was established by measuring
the applied force necessary to bring the heel to the
platform before injection. the reduction in extensor
thrust was considered block of motor function.
nociception was evaluated by the nocifensive reaction
to thermal and mechanical stimulation, i.e., to heat and
pinch. the latency of the withdrawal response to application of a hot (51.0 ⫾ 0.5°c) metal probe (3-mm diameter) to the dorsal surface of the lateral and medial
margin of the metatarsus was monitored. prolongation of
latency to 10 s (cutoff time) was taken as complete
nociceptive block. the nocifensive response to mechanical noxious stimulation (pinch of little toe) was scored
as follows: 3 (normal), 2 (slightly impaired), 1 (severely
impaired), or 0 (absent).
changes of each function were evaluated as percent of
maximal possible effect (%mpe) in each experiment at a
specified time after injection. %mpe was used for a
general comparison of functions measured with different numeric scales.
the definition of %mpe is given by

when the drug abolishes the response, %mpe ⫽
100; when the affected response of the drug is
identical to the control response, %mpe ⫽ 0.
%mpe was calculated for every functional change,
considering 100% of mpe as a complete block of
function, and by comparing the magnitude of evoked response with the magnitude of the predrug control measurement on the same leg. the duration of the complete
block of each function was also measured.

effects of r- and s- xxxd383xxx  on batrachotoxin binding and na⫹ currents were compared by paired student

of variance with bonferonni correction for graded actions
and by the fisher exact test for the proportion of the
population that was fully blocked. p values are listed in
most cases, and p ⬍ 0.05 was taken as the criterion for
significant differences.

inhibition of na⫹ currents
sodium currents under voltage clamp were inhibited
by  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers in tonic (fig. 2) and usedependent (phasic, fig. 3) modes. both prolonged, single
depolarizations and brief, repetitive depolarizations increased the inhibition of  xxxd383xxx , showing that this
drug binds more to open (activated) and inactivated states
than to resting, closed states of the na⫹ channel.18 –21
the degree of block was altered by the membrane
potential in ways that differ between the two enantiomers. in assays of tonic inhibition, when the membrane
was held for 5 s at ⫺80 mv, the r-enantiomer was
slightly but significantly more potent than the s-enantiomer, with ic50 values of 101.7 ⫾ 7.5 ␮m and 132.1 ⫾ 8.8
␮m, respectively, giving a stereopotency ratio (r:s) of 1.3
(p ⫽ 0.02). depolarization of the membrane’s holding
potential increased the affinity for both enantiomers; at
⫺70 mv, ic50 values equaled 34.8 ⫾ 2.4 ␮m and 37.6 ⫾
2.6 ␮m, and at ⫺60 mv, ic50 values equaled 18.6 ⫾ 0.8
␮m and 21.6 ⫾ 1.2 ␮m for r- and s- xxxd383xxx , respectively. although r- xxxd383xxx  was the slightly more
potent enantiomer at these potentials, the stereopotency
ratios were small (1.08 and 1.16, respectively) and not
statistically different from 1.0.
hyperpolarization of the membrane’s holding potential, however, decreased the affinity for both enantiomers; at ⫺100 mv, the ic50 for r- xxxd383xxx  increased
to 317.4 ⫾ 10.5 ␮m and that for s- xxxd383xxx  to 264.0 ⫾
19.4 ␮m. at this potential, the r-enantiomer becomes
significantly less potent than the s-enantiomer (r:s ⫽
0.83; p ⫽ 0.036), as previously reported.22
the kinetic basis for  xxxd383xxx ’s stereoselective
block of na⫹ channels can be gleaned from an analysis of
use-dependent block (fig. 3). repetitive depolarizations
prompted further channel blockade, as reflected by decreasing na⫹ current amplitude during a train of short
pulses applied at 5 hz (fig. 3, current traces). at the same
 xxxd383xxx  concentration, and stimulation frequencies
of 1 and 5 hz, r- xxxd383xxx  produced a slightly slower
developing block that reached a greater steady state than
s- xxxd383xxx  at 5 hz (fig. 3b). for example, at 5 hz and
100 ␮m, r- xxxd383xxx  yields a reduction in peak amplitude of tonic block of 58.5 ⫾ 0.6% with a decay constant
␶ of 4.6 ⫾ 0.8 pulses, whereas s- xxxd383xxx  yields a
reduction in peak amplitude of tonic block of 48.5 ⫾
1.1% with a ␶ of 3.8 ⫾ 0.2 pulses.

an unpaired student t test (sigmastat, jandel scientific software, san rafael, ca) was used to evaluate the significance of differences
in fitted values between r- and s-enantiomers. p values < 0.05 (*) were considered to be statistically significant.

rates of dissociation of  xxxd383xxx  isomers from na⫹
channels were assessed by increasing the recovery interval during which the membrane was unstimulated after
a 10-s depolarizing conditioning pulse to ⫹10 mv and
measuring the recovery current as a function of recovery
time. these recovery kinetics show two phases in the
control situation without drug—a fast and a slow one—
that are attributable to the recovery from fast (hodgkinhuxley type) and slow inactivation, respectively (table
1). both  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers slightly but insignifianesthesiology, v 93, no 3, sep 2000

cantly increased the time constant for fast inactivation,
but their major effect was to increase the fraction of
channels and the time constant of slow recovery, now
reflecting, in part, the dissociation of  xxxd383xxx  from
inactivated channels. the slowly recovering fraction is
increased approximately fourfold over control by r- xxxd383xxx  and threefold by s- xxxd383xxx , and the slow
recovery rate is slowed by approximately the same factors by the respective drugs. in other words, r- xxxd383xxx  dissociates less rapidly from na⫹ channels than

to the receptor.
in vivo sciatic nerve block
all neural deficits occurred at the appropriate anatomic locus, the ipsilateral leg of the injected sciatic
nerve. no effects on the contralateral side were observed, nor were there any generalized indications of
systemic toxicity (abnormal gaits, twitching, or sedation). all neurologic deficits disappeared fully within
3–3.5 h at the longest. there were no residual changes in
anesthesiology, v 93, no 3, sep 2000

function or in gross anatomic appearance of the leg, nor
any signs of local inflammation.
changes in resting posture and in gait were observed
before any other functional impairment, and they lasted
longer. the magnitude and the duration of these changes
appeared to increase with increasing dose, and their
pattern is similar to that previously reported with lidocaine in the rat5: for postural changes, the toes first
became fully extended and then ventroflexed and
curled, and the stifle was extended and the hock
dropped; for changes of gait, the injected limb touched
the supporting surface with more weight bearing on the
lateral margin or with weight bearing on the knuckled
paw, then the leg dragged on the supporting surface.
the graded deficits in the four neurobehavioral functions mediated by the sciatic nerve are exemplified in
figure 4 for blockade by the three drugs at a dose of
0.125%. inhibition of nocifensive responses, to both
noxious heat and pinch, is smaller in degree and shorter
in duration than inhibition of proprioception and motor
function, a differential functional block that occurs at all
doses. data such as those in figure 4 were used to
compare the effects of the three drugs in terms of maximum graded effects (%mpe), the period after injection
during which the maximum effect occurred, and the
duration of significant partial deficits (i.e., ⬎ 20% mpe)
for both motor activity and the nocifensive response to
pinch. the first two of these parameters are shown in
table 2, the last in table 3.
no stereoselective actions of drugs on maximum
%mpe was observed, with the exception of inhibition of
the response to pinch at 0.125%, where r ⫽ s ⬎ racemic. durations of the maximum effect (table 2) as well of
partial deficits (table 3) generally increased with increasing dose for all three drugs and, for the partial deficit of
both motor and nociception, the duration of effect from

s- xxxd383xxx  is less than, or occasionally equal to, that
from r- xxxd383xxx  at all doses. in contrast, the duration
of effects from racemic  xxxd383xxx  has no consistent
relationship to those from the single enantiomers, being
sometimes greater than both, sometimes less than either,
and sometimes between the two.
these complex actions cannot be explained by a single
mechanism, such as binding to na⫹ channels, but probably
arise from a combination of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences. both factors contribute to the
integrated actions of the drugs, which can be compared by
calculating the area under the curve for the %mpe functions versus time, such as those in figure 4. such a comparison is made in figure 5, where integrated inhibition of
motor functions (fig. 5a) and heat nociception (fig. 5b) are
presented graphically for three  xxxd383xxx  doses: 0.125,
0.25, and 1%. no significant differences exist between the
two stereoisomers or the racemic mixture when this integrated activity is compared.

another measure of local anesthetic effect having a
strong analogy to clinical anesthesia is the fraction of
injected animals that become completely blocked. scoring by presence or absence of response quantizes the
population, and is shown in figure 6 for all four behavioral functions inhibited by  xxxd383xxx  doses of 0.125
and 0.5%. as for the graded response (%mpe), the fully
blocked fraction increased with dose in both degree and
duration. interestingly, at the lower dose (0.0625) the
fraction of thermal nocifensive responses that was fully
blocked was greater than that of either proprioceptive or
motor functions, the opposite relation from when a
graded response (%mpe) was evaluated (fig. 4).

effect (%mpe) versus time for (a) motor block and (b) inhibition of the nocifensive response to thermal stimulation at three
concentrations of the  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers and racemate.
areas were determined by measuring the profile from the averaged data, as graphed in figure 4, and the errors were estimated from the envelopes formed between the larger and
smaller extremes of the sds.

the fraction of animals fully blocked at the lower dose
(0.125%, fig. 6a) also demonstrated a greater effect of rover racemic  xxxd383xxx , particularly for the later
phases of motor block and heat nociception, and greater
effects of the s-enantiomer over the racemate for heat
nociception. however, at the higher dose (0.5%, fig. 6b),
there was no difference among the three drugs in the
extent (all near or at 100%) or the duration of full
functional blockade.

discussion
the experimental results show that both  xxxd383xxx 
stereoisomers and the racemic mixture are safe and
anesthesiology, v 93, no 3, sep 2000

effective for in vivo nerve block in the rat. neither local
nor systemic toxicity or irritation is apparent, judging by
the calm, unsedated behavior or the animals and their
continuous ease in handling. the observed inhibitions
were fully reversible in the dose range used here.
these doses can be compared with those used in
humans. for example, for axillary (brachial plexus)
blockade in adults, 20 –30 ml (5 mg/ml)  xxxd383xxx ,
0.5%, might be delivered. this results in a dosing of
1.5–2 mg/kg total body mass for this block. for the rat
sciatic nerve, injection of 0.1 ml  xxxd383xxx , 0.5%, also
produces a secure block, also corresponding to a dosing
of 1.5–2 mg/kg. this is to some degree a fortuitous
agreement, because local vascularity, surface:volume relationships and species-dependent pharmacokinetic factors may differ markedly between the two circumstances. still, the agreement supports the extension of
qualitative results from rats to humans. r- xxxd383xxx  is
generally more potent than s- xxxd383xxx  when assayed
in vitro for na⫹ channel inhibitory activity, although the
exact stereopotency depends on the the assay and the
conditions. antagonism of batrachotoxin binding shows
a greater stereoselectivity (approximately 3:1) than the
tonic blockade of resting or inactivated channels measured by voltage clamp (approximately 0.8 –1.3:1). the
same 3:1 stereopotency was found previously by lee son
et al.4 for competitive antagonism by  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers of the depolarizing action of veratridine on frog
sciatic nerves.23
inhibition of na⫹ shows the resting channel conformation (favored at ⫺100 mv) to have a slightly higher
(1.2-fold) affinity for s- over r- xxxd383xxx , while the
inactivated channel (favored at ⫺60 mv) binds the renantiomer 17 times tighter and the s-enantiomer 12
times tighter than their resting-state affinities, resulting
in only approximately a 1.2-fold stereopotency ratio
(r:s) in the moderately depolarized membrane. these
findings confirm and extend the earlier reports of weak
but significant stereoselectivity (r ⬎ s) for the inhibition
of neuronal action potentials4,24 and na⫹ currents,22,25
both of which were enhanced by steady or repeated
transient depolarization. in a nerve membrane at the
“normal” resting potential of ⫺70 to ⫺80 mv, therefore,
the r-  xxxd383xxx  enantiomer is approximately 1.3
times more potent for tonic blockade of na⫹ channels.4
however, use-dependent actions, which result from increased local anesthetic binding to na⫹ channels
opened or inactivated by repeated stimulation, will lead
to a stereoselective phasic block more favorable to rbupivacaine. the underlying kinetic mechanism re-

racemate by the fisher exact test.

ported here describes a slower dissociation of r- xxxd383xxx  from inactivated channels compared with
s- xxxd383xxx . a similar, state-dependent affinity difference occurs with cardiac na⫹ channels25 and would be
particularly emphasized during the large and prolonged
systolic depolarization of cardiac tissues. this may explain the pronounced stereoselectivity of cardiotoxicity
(see below).
in contrast to the in vitro neuronal stereopotency,
only small differences in enantiomer potency could be
detected for the neurobehavioral deficits that characterize sciatic nerve block in vivo. neither the maximum
degree of blockade (%mpe) nor its duration was clearly
favored by one enantiomer at all doses, for any of the
four functions tested, although the fraction of animals
completely blocked by 0.125% r- xxxd383xxx  was
anesthesiology, v 93, no 3, sep 2000

greater than when 0.125% of the racemate was used.
stereoselective (r ⬎ s) actions of  xxxd383xxx  isomers
have been reported for infiltration anesthesia in animals2
and humans,26 but other clinical trials have not detected
a significant difference in degree (intensity), spread, or
duration of block between  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers or
between  xxxd2468xxx  and the racemic mixture.27
there are several possible explanations for the difference between in vitro and in vivo stereoselectivity findings. first, the predominant mode of neural blockade
that underlies functional deficits may be a result of tonic
inhibition of resting nerve fibers. stereoselectivity for
this block in vitro is modest at best, as reported here
(fig. 2c) and in other reports4,24 and might be undetected during typical clinical tests, where quantitation is not
a primary objective and intraindividual variability is high.

754
vladimirov et al.

the methods used here for assaying functional neural
blockade can readily discriminate dose differences of
threefold, near the ed50 (e.g., see table 2, nociception);
therefore, if potency differences of 3:1, as shown for
batrachotoxin displacement or the competitive antagonism of veratridine’s actions,4 were reflected in functional blockade they should be detectable.27
second, inhibition of k⫹ channels by  xxxd383xxx ,
known in some cases to have a strong (r ⬎ s) stereoselectivity,28,29 may either potentiate30 or antagonize31 impulse blockade that is primarily caused by inhibition of
na⫹ channels. because different types of axons, classified by anatomy (nonmyelinated, myelinated) or by function (sensory, motor), appear to have different kinds of
k⫹ channels,32–35 blockade of na⫹ channels may not be
the predominant factor determining the stereoselectivity
of impulse blockade.
third, the local disposition of drug that is a major
determinant of degree and duration of neural blockade
may favor the neuronal uptake of the intrinsically less
potent enantiomer, thus nullifying any pharmacodynamic advantage. studies of rat sciatic nerve block with
radiolabeled lidocaine reveal that only a few percent of
the total injected dose (in 0.1 ml) actually is present in
the nerve during the peak of functional deficits.36 vasoconstriction by epinephrine (1:100,000) is known to
potentiate and prolong this blockade and also elevates
intraneural lidocaine approximately twofold (unpublished observations). the s-enantiomers of piperidinering local anesthetics, e.g., s-mepivacaine, ropivacaine,
and s- xxxd383xxx , are reported to be more vasoconstrictive than the r-enantiomers,26,37 and thus, through this
vascular action, s- xxxd383xxx  could enhance its own
neuronal uptake and potentiate its own block, more so
than the comparative actions of r- xxxd383xxx .
finally, all of these factors could be contributing to the
overall observed functional block in vivo, because the
participation of any one factor does not preclude the
others.
that neural blockade in vivo shows little to no significant stereoselectivity for sensory or motor deficits contrasts with the effects on cardiac activities,3,38,39 where
r- xxxd383xxx  is both more potent and more toxic than
s- xxxd383xxx . the discrepancy between neuronal “therapeutic” and cardiac “toxic” actions may arise from the
different states of the na⫹ channel involved in the effects on these different tissues. neural blockade requires
relatively high concentrations of  xxxd383xxx , likely
binding to resting state na⫹ channels in a nerve membrane most often at a potential of ⫺70 to ⫺80 mv
anesthesiology, v 93, no 3, sep 2000

(where little stereoselectivity of block is present) and
only briefly depolarized by neuronal impulses. in contrast, cardiac effects that can be produced by much
lower drug concentrations arise from binding to inactivated na⫹ channels (with higher r ⬎ s stereoselectivity)
that are populated during the hundreds of millisecond–
long depolarizations of cardiac action potentials.25 one
would predict from these state-dependent affinities that
r- xxxd383xxx  would be more cardiotoxic than s- xxxd383xxx , a prediction born out by in vitro3,38,39 and
in vivo studies.40,41 these differences in cardiotoxicity
between r- and s-enantiomers of  xxxd383xxx  (or between ropivacaine and its r-enantiomer), coupled with
equipotency for nerve block in vivo, might provide an
advantage in therapeutic index that justifies their clinical
use.
