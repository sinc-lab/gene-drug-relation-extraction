purpose
xl184 ( xxxd401xxx ) is a potent inhibitor of met,  xxxg1274xxx 
( xxxg1274xxx ), and ret, with robust antiangiogenic, antitumor, and anti-invasive effects in preclinical
models. early observations of clinical benefit in a phase i study of  xxxd401xxx , which included
patients with medullary thyroid cancer (mtc), led to expansion of an mtc-enriched cohort, which
is the focus of this article.
patients and methods
a phase i dose-escalation study of oral  xxxd401xxx  was conducted in patients with advanced solid
tumors. primary end points included evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, and maximum-tolerated
dose (mtd) determination. additional end points included recist (response evaluation criteria in
solid tumors) response, pharmacodynamics, ret mutational status, and biomarker analyses.
results
eighty-five patients were enrolled, including 37 with mtc. the mtd was 175 mg daily.
dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (ppe), mucositis, and ast,
alt, and lipase elevations and grade 2 mucositis that resulted in dose interruption and reduction.
ten (29%) of 35 patients with mtc with measurable disease had a confirmed partial response.
overall, 18 patients experienced tumor shrinkage of 30% or more, including 17 (49%) of 35
patients with mtc with measurable disease. additionally, 15 (41%) of 37 patients with mtc had
stable disease (sd) for at least 6 months, resulting in sd for 6 months or longer or confirmed partial
response in 68% of patients with mtc.
conclusion
 xxxd401xxx  has an acceptable safety profile and is active in mtc.  xxxd401xxx  may provide clinical benefit
by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways of importance in mtc, including met,  xxxg1274xxx , and ret. a
global phase iii pivotal study in mtc is ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov number nct00215605).

introduction

the development of antiangiogenic agents targeting
the  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf)/
vegf receptor (vegfr) signaling pathway has led
to key advances in the treatment of cancer. for example, the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab and
small-molecule multitargeted vegfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tkis) sorafenib and sunitinib have
produced statistically significant survival improvements in some cancers.1-3 however, these survival
improvements have been modest, and attempts to
demonstrate single-agent therapeutic utility across a
wide range of cancers have been unsuccessful. a
potential explanation for these results may come

from recent preclinical and clinical studies indicating that despite providing some short-term clinical
benefit, agents targeting the vegf signaling pathway can ultimately promote tumor aggressiveness,
with invasion into neighboring tissues and metastasis to distant sites.4-7 a mechanism for these untoward effects of  xxxd328xxx  therapy may be the
upregulation of met, a proinvasive receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (rtk) implicated in tumor growth,
metastasis, and angiogenesis.8,9
 xxxd401xxx  is a potent inhibitor of rtks,
including met,  xxxg1274xxx , and ret.10,11 in preclinical studies,  xxxd401xxx  exhibited significant antiangiogenic and antitumor activity in a broad range
of tumor models, including a model of medullary

activity of  xxxd401xxx  in patients with medullary thyroid cancer

thyroid cancer (mtc) with an activating ret mutation. importantly,
it has also been shown in preclinical studies that treatment with  xxxd401xxx  results in decreased tumor invasiveness and decreased metastasis compared with either vehicle control or agents targeting vegf
signaling without met inhibition.11 this report focuses on results
from a phase i open-label dose-escalation study of  xxxd401xxx  in
patients with a wide range of advanced malignancies, including an
expanded cohort of patients with advanced mtc.
activating mutations in ret play a central role in tumorigenesis
in both inherited and sporadic forms of mtc. as a component of
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndromes, hereditary mtc
comprises 25% to 30% of all mtc cases and is caused by germline
gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ret.12 in the sporadic form of the disease, somatic mutations in ret occur in 30% to
50% of patients. in addition to ret, met and its ligand, hepatocyte
growth factor, also seem to play significant roles in the pathogenesis of
mtc, in which both proteins are frequently coexpressed.13 notably, it
has been shown that overexpression of met can be driven by activation of the ret signaling pathway, albeit in a cell type different from
that giving rise to mtc.14 in addition to met and ret, the vegf
signaling pathway has also been implicated in mtc and is likely
involved in disease progression.15,16
patients with metastatic mtc have a poor prognosis, with approximately 25% and 10% alive at 5 and 10 years, respectively.17
furthermore, mtc is largely unresponsive to conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy and radiotherapy.18 doxorubicin, the only us food
and drug administration–approved treatment for patients with advanced thyroid cancer, has resulted in transient tumor response rates
in 0% to 20% of patients with mtc and is associated with significant
toxicity.19,20 although the results of a phase iii trial of  xxxd3489xxx  have
recently been presented showing improved progression-free survival,21 there remains an unmet medical need in mtc; no randomized
trials have yet been associated with increased overall survival in this
patient population.

patients and methods
patients
the study enrolled adult patients with histologically confirmed solid
tumors or lymphomas that were metastatic or unresectable who were no
longer responding to conventional therapies or who had disease for which no
standard therapy exists. all patients had an eastern cooperative oncology
group performance status score of 0 to 2 and life expectancy longer than 3
months. additional parameters for study entry included adequate neutrophil
counts (ⱖ 1,500/␮l), platelets (ⱖ 100,000/␮l), hemoglobin (ⱖ 9g/dl), bilirubin (ⱖ 1.5 mg/dl), serum creatinine (⬍ 1.5 mg/dl), and alt and ast (ⱕ
2.5 ⫻ upper limit of normal with no liver involvement or ⱕ 5 ⫻ upper limit of
normal with liver involvement). patients were ineligible if they had received
chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks, nitrosourea therapy within
6 weeks, or radiotherapy or investigational agents within 30 days of the first
dose of  xxxd401xxx . patients with brain metastases, uncontrolled intercurrent illness, or known hiv infection were ineligible. this study was conducted
in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. patients provided written
informed consent according to institutional guidelines. the study was approved by the institutional review board at each study center.
study design and treatment
using a three-plus-three study design, patients were assigned to 13 dose
levels exploring two different schedules of administration and formulations of
 xxxd401xxx . dose levels one to nine (0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, 1.28, 2.56, 5.12,
www.jco.org

7.68, and 11.52 mg/kg) explored an intermittent schedule (once daily for 5
days followed by 9 days rest) with a suspension formulation, dose levels 10 to
11 (175 and 265 mg) used continuous fixed daily dosing with a suspension
formulation, and dose levels 12 to 13 (175 and 250 mg) and the mtd (175 mg)
cohort used continuous fixed daily dosing with capsules. all patients were
instructed to take  xxxd401xxx  in a fasting state (2 hours before and 1 hour
after administration of  xxxd401xxx ). patients continued to take  xxxd401xxx 
until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events. intrapatient dose
escalation was allowed once the mtd was established with the capsule formulation, and dose holds and reductions were allowed for management of adverse
events (aes). additionally, an expanded mtd cohort that included patients
with metastatic and/or locally advanced or locally recurrent mtc not appropriate for surgical resection was initiated.

were male, and 64 of the patients (75%) had prior chemotherapy. the
most common tumor diagnosis was mtc (n ⫽ 37; 44%). the study
population was enrolled across five study centers. seventy-seven patients with measurable disease according to recist were evaluable
for response, including 35 patients with mtc. two patients with
mtc had bone metastases or lesions too small to measure by recist
but were assessable by computed tomography, magnetic resonance
imaging, or bone scan. in the mtc subset, a majority of the cases were
sporadic (22 [71%] of 31 patients), with three (10%) of 31 patients
presenting with inherited mtc (table 1).

assessment of safety and efficacy
aes were assessed at each visit and graded according to the common
terminology criteria for adverse events, version 3.0. safety assessments included an evaluation of the aes, physical examination, and evaluations of
performance status, body weight, complete blood count, serum chemistries,
urinalysis, and electrocardiography at regularly scheduled intervals. doselimiting toxicity (dlt) was defined as either the occurrence of a treatmentrelated ae of potential clinical significance such that additional dose escalation
would expose patients in higher dose cohorts to risk of irreversible medical
harm or require medical treatment to avoid irreversible medical harm or any
 xxxd401xxx -related grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, including grade 3
nausea and/or vomiting and grade 3 diarrhea despite prophylaxis and/or
treatment or the following grade 4 hematologic toxicities: thrombocytopenia,
neutropenia of more than 5 days duration, and neutropenia of any duration
with fever or documented infection.
tumor response was assessed by investigators using recist (response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors) at baseline, at 28 days after the first dose
of  xxxd401xxx , and every 8 weeks thereafter.22 tumor response was confirmed by repeat imaging at least 28 days after the initial response assessment.
pharmacokinetic, calcitonin,  xxxg427xxx  (cea), and genotyping analyses were done. a detailed description of the methods is included in the
appendix (online only).

safety results
dlts were observed in three dose levels. in dose level 9 (11.52mg/kg suspension intermittent dosing cohort), two of three patients
experienced dlts, with one experiencing grade 3 ppe and grade 3
ast/alt elevations and one experiencing grade 3 lipase elevation. in
dose level 11 (265-mg suspension daily dosing cohort), two of 10
patients experienced a dlt of mucositis (one with grade 2 and one
with grade 3). in dose level 13 (250-mg capsule dosing cohort), two of
six patients experienced dlts, with one experiencing grade 3 ast
elevation and one experiencing grade 3 ppe, thus establishing the
next-lowest well-tolerated dose level of 175 mg daily as the maximumtolerated capsule dose and the dose for the ongoing phase iii
trial xl184-301.
a total of 77 patients (90%) reported at least one treatmentrelated ae (table 2). of these, 43% reported grade 1 or 2 aes. the
most frequent treatment-related aes (⬎ 20% of patients) were diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, ppe, rash, increased ast

level, vomiting, and mucosal inflammation. one grade 4 event (pulmonary embolism, dose level 10, 175-mg suspension daily dosing)
was assessed as related to  xxxd401xxx . treatment-related hypertension of grade 3 severity occurred in two patients (2%) and of grade 1 to
2 severity occurred in 12 patients (14%), most of whom had a history
of hypertension. there were no treatment-related grade 5 events, and
the nature of aes was similar between patients with mtc and those
with other solid tumor diagnoses.
response
of the 35 patients with mtc with measurable disease, confirmed
objective response was achieved in 10 (29%; 95% ci, 15% to 45%),
each of whom had a partial response (table 3). five of the 10 responders had a partial response at the first radiologic assessment, and responses occurred most commonly at the 175-mg dose level. overall,
17 patients (49%) experienced a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of
tumor measurements compared with baseline measurements (fig
1a), including seven patients without confirmed response resulting
either from lack of response based on the subsequent confirmatory
scan or from study discontinuation before the subsequent scan. stable
disease of at least 6 months duration (range, 6.4 to 31.1 months) was
observed in 15 (41%) of the 37 patients with mtc.
stable disease of at least 6 months or confirmed partial response
was observed in 25 (68%) of 37 patients with mtc. onset of tumor
response in the mtc population was reported as early as day 21 and as
late as day 365. median time to response was 49.5 days, whereas the
median duration of response has not yet been reached (range, 3.9 to ⬎

35 months) with a minimum of 17 months of follow-up. of the 20
(54%) of 37 patients with mtc who had received prior therapy, 16
(43%) of 37 were treated with tkis (table 1). three of the 10 responses occurred in patients with mtc in whom prior tki therapies
had failed, including those known to inhibit ret (eg,  xxxd3489xxx  and
sorafenib),23-27 as well as in patients who had previously received
treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
for the non-mtc subset, stable disease of at least 3 months was
reported in 38% of patients (fig 1b). this included the following
tumors: colorectal (three patients), melanoma (two patients), and
carcinoid (two patients) tumors and adenoid cystic, follicular thyroid,
papillary thyroid, hepatocellular, renal cell carcinoma, cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma, salivary gland, alveolar sarcoma, clear-cell sarcoma,
mesothelioma, and neuroendocrine tumor originating in the thyroid
(one patient each). the patient with a neuroendocrine tumor originating in the thyroid also experienced tumor shrinkage of more than
30% (fig 1b).
genotyping analyses
germline and somatic ret genotyping for the patients with
mtc was performed using dna isolated from whole blood (n ⫽ 30)
and tumor (n ⫽ 31), respectively. activating ret mutations were
detected in tumors from 25 (81%) of 31 patients with mtc (table 1;
fig 1). notably, the tumor of one patient with rapid clinical progression exhibited no detectable ret mutation in the analyzed clinically
relevant mutational hotspots; however, a braf activating mutation
(g469a) and a 2.2-fold amplification of the gene encoding met were
detected (appendix table a1, online only). of the four remaining
patients without detectable ret hotspot mutations, one was found to
have a 1.7-fold amplification of met in the tumor. in addition, sequence analysis of met in tumor dna from a subset of patients with
mtc (n ⫽ 15) did not reveal any mutations (appendix table a1). a
strict correlation was not observed between ret mutational status
and either clinical response or time on study.
pharmacokinetics
the peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma
concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable time point for
 xxxd401xxx  increased in proportion to dose in the individual dosing
cohorts. after repeat daily dosing, terminal half-life values (mean ⫾
standard deviation) for  xxxd401xxx  were 91.3 ⫾ 33.3 hours (n ⫽ 23),
and apparent steady-state plasma levels were reached by day 15.
steady-state clearance for the 175-mg capsule dose derived from repeat dose data was 4.2 ⫾ 1.5 l/h. patients receiving 175-mg  xxxd401xxx  capsules had four- to five-fold higher steady-state exposure (area
under the curve) compared with day 1 (7.68 ⫾ 2.85 ␮g ⴱ h/ml; n ⫽
23 v 41.6 ⫾ 15.5 ␮g ⴱ h/ml; n ⫽ 23), indicating that  xxxd401xxx 
accumulated with repeat daily dosing (appendix table a2, online
only). there was no significant difference in exposure between

changes were observed in the levels of circulating biomarkers
related to the mechanism of action of  xxxd401xxx , including  xxxg1734xxx ,  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx , erythropoietin, and soluble met (appendix fig a1, online only). in addition, decreased
phosphorylation of met and ret was observed in skin biopsies
obtained from one patient with mtc (appendix fig a2, online only).
discussion

this phase i study of  xxxd401xxx  demonstrated that the drug is active
in mtc, with an acceptable spectrum of toxicity. mtc is a neuroendocrine malignancy arising from parafollicular calcitonin-producing
c cells, a neural crest-derived tissue that normally expresses the ret
rtk.26,28 a detailed understanding of the molecular lesions associated
with mtc has spurred development of new therapeutic approaches
for patients with metastatic disease. rtk inhibitors targeting ret
and/or  xxxg1274xxx  have been reported to result in partial response rates

as high as 20% in this disease.23-25,29-31  xxxd401xxx  is among the first
molecules in the class of dual ret/ xxxg1274xxx  inhibitors to also inhibit
met, an rtk that is overexpressed in many human tumors, including those of the thyroid epithelium.13 on the basis of preclinical data,
this attribute of  xxxd401xxx  may result in decreased tumor invasiveness and metastatic spread compared to vegf pathway inhibition
without met inhibition.11
frequently reported aes of  xxxd401xxx  are largely consistent
with those of other agents that target rtks, including  xxxg1274xxx , kit,
and ret.24,25,31 the incidence of hypertension (16% all grades, including 2% grade 3) reported in this study (table 2) is lower than expected,comparedwiththeincidenceoftreatment-relatedhypertensionin
recent studies with other tkis, including motesanib29 and  xxxd252xxx .32
the confirmed partial response rate of 29%, rapidity of response,
and prolonged duration of response observed in a largely heavily
pretreated population of patients with mtc that included prior tki/
ret-inhibitor therapy, including  xxxd3489xxx , compares favorably

with efficacy reported in other trials of tkis in mtc.23,25,31,33 however, the clinical significance of the reported prolonged stable disease
in this patient group is uncertain because of the lack of evidence of
disease progression before study entry. fifty-four percent of patients
with mtc had received prior therapy (table 1), including 16 patients
(43%) who were treated with tkis. one patient with mtc harbored
an activating braf mutation, a rare finding in this disease group.33
braf is known to signal downstream of the rtks targeted by  xxxd401xxx , which may account for the lack of response in this patient
(figs 1a and b).
evidence of tumor regression was observed in patients with and
without identified ret mutations in the analyzed clinically relevant
mutational hotspots, suggestive of anticancer effects potentially attributable to inhibition of targets other than ret, such as met and/or
 xxxg1274xxx , or to as yet unknown aberrations in the ret pathway.
notably, evidence of durable tumor shrinkage or stable disease was
observed in 12 of 15 patients with mtc with a somatic m918t
mutation in ret (treatment duration range, 6 to 38 months),
which has been shown to be a strong negative prognostic indicator
for metastasis-free and overall survival.34 this degree of durable
response in patients with the m918t mutation contrasts with the
limited clinical benefit of  xxxd2671xxx , a ret and vegfr inhibitor,
in similar patients.29
exposure to  xxxd401xxx  resulted in significant changes in levels
of the circulating biomarkers  xxxg1734xxx ,  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx , and erythropoietin, consistent with changes observed
with other antiangiogenic agents.35 levels of soluble met in plasma
increased during treatment, a finding consistent with preclinical observations made with a met-targeted monoclonal antibody,36 and an
analysis of skin samples from a patient with mtc revealed decreased
phosphorylation of met and ret after administration of  xxxd401xxx . in addition, although calcitonin and cea generally decreased
from baseline in patients with any measurable tumor shrinkage (fig
2), a significant correlation between the magnitude of tumor reduction and magnitude of reduction of calcitonin was not observed. the
lack of correlation between calcitonin changes and tumor reduction
may be the result of a pharmacodynamic effect of  xxxd401xxx  on
ret, in that ret is known to mediate calcitonin secretion via modulation of calcitonin gene transcription.37
in summary, these phase i results indicate that  xxxd401xxx  is
active in patients with mtc, including those who harbor somatic ret
www.jco.org

mutations and are potentially at high risk for progression and death.34
 xxxd401xxx  has an acceptable safety profile and dose-dependent
exposure and half-life supporting once daily dosing, with only moderate inter-individual variability. future studies will evaluate the need
for administration of the drug in a fasting state. furthermore,  xxxd401xxx  is active in patients who have progressed while receiving prior therapies, including other inhibitors of ret and  xxxg1274xxx . an international
phase iii study of  xxxd401xxx  is ongoing in patients with progressive mtc.
