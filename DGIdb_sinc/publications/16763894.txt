summary  xxxd3047xxx  is the cofactor for over 100
enzyme-catalysed reactions in the body, including many involved in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters.
inadequate levels of  xxxd3047xxx  in the brain cause
neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy. there are
several different mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for pyridoxine and/or  xxxd3047xxx . these
include: (i) inborn errors affecting the pathways of b6 vitamer metabolism; (ii) inborn errors that lead to accumulation of small molecules that react with  xxxd3047xxx  and inactivate it; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal
phosphate; (iv) coeliac disease, which is thought to lead
to malabsorption of b6 vitamers; (v) renal dialysis, which
leads to increased losses of b6 vitamers from the circulation;
(vi) drugs that affect the metabolism of b6 vitamers; and
(vii) inborn errors affecting specific pyridoxal phosphatedependent enzymes. the last show a very variable degree
of pyridoxine responsiveness, from 90% in x-linked sideroblastic anaemia (delta- xxxd148xxx  synthase deficiency)
through 50% in homocystinuria ( xxxg350xxx 
deficiency) to 5% in ornithinaemia with  xxxg1621xxx  ( xxxg1621xxx  deficiency). the possible role of
 xxxd3047xxx  as a chaperone during folding of nascent
enzymes is discussed. high-dose pyridoxine or pyridoxal
phosphate may have deleterious side-effects (particularly pe-

ripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this must be considered in treatment regimes. none the less, in some patients,
particularly infants with intractable epilepsy, treatment with
pyridoxine or  xxxd3047xxx  can be life-saving, and in
other infants with inborn errors of metabolism b6 treatment
can be extremely beneficial.
chemical structure of b6 vitamers
 xxxd3049xxx  is present in the human body as six vitamers,
which all share a 2-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine structure but
differ in the nature of the c4 and c5 substituents (fig. 1)
(sauberlich 1999). the c4 carbon bears a hydroxymethyl
group (−ch2 oh) in pyridoxine, an aldehyde group (−cho)
in pyridoxal, and an aminomethyl group (−ch2 nh2 ) in pyridoxamine. all three of these c4 variants can exist with the c5
substituent as a hydroxymethyl group or with this group esterified to phosphate (e.g. pyridoxal 5 -phosphate). in plants
the c5 hydroxymethyl group of pyridoxine can be esterified
to glucose, forming pyridoxine-5 -beta-d-glucoside.
sources of  xxxd3049xxx 
 xxxd3049xxx  in human breast milk is present as pyridoxal
phosphate plus pyridoxal (morrison and driskell 1985). in
animal-derived foods it is also present largely as pyridoxal
phosphate and in greatest amounts in meat (including poultry and fish) because, in animals, the largest store of  xxxd3047xxx  is present in muscle, associated with glycogen phosphorylase. smaller amounts of  xxxd3048xxx  are also present in animal-derived foods. in plantderived foods, b6 is present mainly as pyridoxine, pyridoxine
phosphate and pyridoxine glucoside (which appears to have
reduced bioavailability because of the need for hydrolysis by

an intestinal glucosidase) (mackey et al 2003). when foods
are fortified with b6 (e.g. soya meat substitutes), the form
that is used is usually pyridoxine (hydrochloride). the two
b6 vitamers that have been used therapeutically are pyridoxine (hydrochloride) and pyridoxal 5 -phosphate (plp); this
review will discuss disorders responsive to pyridoxine and/or
plp.
reactivity of pyridoxal 5 -phosphate
pyridoxal 5 -phosphate is a highly reactive chemical. the
aldehyde group can react with:
1. amino groups, by condensation reactions to form a covalent schiff base, e.g. the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues
at the active sites of plp-dependent enzymes, the alpha-amino
groups of amino acids during plp-catalysed reactions, or
the epsilon-amino group of lysine-130 in albumin
2. hydrazines, by condensation reactions e.g. hydralazine,
isoniazid, carbidopa
3. substituted hydroxylamines, by condensation reactions
e.g. d-cycloserine
4. sulphydryl compounds, e.g. l- xxxd2870xxx 
the ability of small molecules to react with plp and inactivate it is an important factor in pyridoxine dependency,
both in patients taking drugs such as isoniazid and in certain
inborn errors of metabolism; the latter will be discussed in
more detail below. the reactions of plp with lysine residues
of proteins and with the alpha-amino groups of amino acids are
essential to the numerous reactions involving amino acids
that are catalysed by plp-dependent enzymes.
physiological roles
our requirement for b6 arises mainly from the fact that
plp is the cofactor for over 100 enzyme-catalysed reactions that occur in humans. the majority of these reactions
involve amino acids. when plp reacts with the alpha-amino
springer

group of an amino acid substrate, it stabilizes a negative
charge at calpha . this facilitates reactions at the alpha, beta and
gamma positions (eliot and kirsch 2004). some of the important pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzymes in relation
to b6 deficiency, known or suspected inborn errors of
metabolism and/or seizures are listed in table 1. it can be
seen that the metabolism of the sollowing neurotransmitters could be affected by plp deficiency: dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), glycine,  xxxd5xxx , glutamate,
 xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), and histamine. furthermore, the
following might be indicators of deficient flux through a
plp-deficient pathway: raised csf 3-methoxytyrosine (3o-methyl-dopa); raised urinary vanillyllactate; low csf
homovanillic acid (hva) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5-hiaa); raised threonine and/or glycine and/or serine
and/or histidine in csf and perhaps in plasma; raised plasma
total homocysteine, and plasma and urine homocystine;
raised urinary cystathionine; increased urinary xanthurenic
acid (particularly following a tryptophan load); and microcytic, hypochromic anaemia.
plp also acts as the cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase,
although the mechanism is different from that seen in reactions involving amino acids (takagi et al 1982). other physiological roles of b6 include modulation of steroid receptor
interaction (tully et al 1994) and regulation of immune function. plp binds tightly to the d1 domain of the  xxxg388xxx 
(salhany and schopfer 1993) and it has been suggested that
this may interfere with the reaction of cd4 with mhc ii
(namazi 2003)
there is some evidence that in some situations b6 vitamers
can function as antioxidants, quenching singlet oxygen at a
rate comparable to vitamins c and e (ehrenshaft et al 1999;
bilski et al 2000).

dietary deficiency of  xxxd3049xxx 
isolated dietary deficiency of  xxxd3049xxx  is rare. the first reports were of an ill-defined syndrome characterized by weakness, irritability, nervous disorder, insomnia and difficulty
with walking. in1954, coursin observed that when infants
were fed on a formula containing only 60 mug/l of b6 they
developed irritability and seizures. these changes were reversed when their b6 intake was restored to 8 mug/kg per day.
a dietary intake of b6 of less than 7 mug/kg per day also causes
eeg changes in adults (kretsch et al 1991). the changes can
be reversed by restoring  xxxd3049xxx  intake to 8 mug/kg per day.
biochemical changes observed in  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency include increased urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid (fouts
and lepkovsky 1942), raised plasma concentrations of threonine, glycine and serine (park and linkswiler 1971).
hyperhomocystinaemia has also been seen in elderly subjects who are receiving insufficient b6 . a daily supplement

(mckinley et al 2001).

in the next sections we will discuss the effect of deficiency
of  xxxg1793xxx  and tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (inborn
errors affecting the interconversion of b6 vitamers).

decreased absorption of b6 vitamers
there is evidence to suggest that absorption of b6 vitamers
is impaired in coeliac disease (kowlessar et al 1964). surprisingly, plp concentrations in plasma are still low in some
patients who have been on a gluten-free diet for 10 years
(hallert et al 2002).

metabolic pathways, including interconversion of b6
vitamers
the phosphorylated b6 vitamers in the diet are thought to be
hydrolysed to pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine by intestinal phosphatases prior to absorption (fig. 2). pyridoxineglucoside is hydrolysed to pyridoxine by a glucosidase. the
absorbed pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine are rapidly
cleared, principally by uptake into the liver, where they are
phosphorylated by  xxxg1720xxx .  xxxd2833xxx 
and  xxxd3048xxx  are then converted to pyridoxal
phosphate by pyridox(am)ine-5 -phosphate oxidase ( xxxg1793xxx ).
 xxxd3047xxx  re-enters the circulation bound to the
lysine-190 residue of albumin. delivery of active cofactor
to the tissues requires hydrolysis of circulating pyridoxal
phosphate to pyridoxal by the ecto-enzyme tissue nonspecific
alkaline phosphatase. pyridoxal is able to cross the blood–
brain barrier (and enter other tissues) but then needs to be
re-phosphorylated by  xxxg1720xxx  to produce active cofactor.

inborn errors affecting interconversion of b6
vitamers
pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase deficiency
autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the  xxxg1793xxx 
gene encoding pyridox(am)ine-5 -phosphate oxidase have
been described in 5 infants with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy from three families (mills et al 2005). in all of
these newborns, the severe seizure disorder did not respond
to treatment with pyridoxine; in the one infant in whom  xxxd3047xxx  was tried there was a dramatic cessation
of seizures. these 5 infants will be described below. much
larger numbers of infants have been described in whom severe epilepsy has been better controlled with the use of plp
than with the use of pyridoxine (wang et al 2005). it is not
yet known whether any of these infants have mutations or
polymorphisms in the  xxxg1793xxx  gene.
all 5 infants with homozygous  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency were
born prematurely and all but one had low apgar scores
and/or required intubation. early acidosis was also common.
seizures commenced on the first day of life and were associated with an eeg showing a burst suppression pattern.
the convulsions, which included myoclonic jerks and severe
tonic-clonic seizures, were resistant to conventional anticonvulsant drugs. in two patients pyridoxine treatment led to a
partial improvement in clonic contractions and lip-smacking
automatisms.

csf concentrations of the dopamine metabolite hva
and of the serotonin metabolite 5hiaa were low. the
csf concentration of the l-dopa metabolite 3-o-methyldopa (3-methoxytyrosine) was very high. the urinary excretion of another l-dopa metabolite, vanillyllactic acid, was
increased. these changes indicated reduced activity of the
plp-dependent enzyme aromatic l-amino-acid decarboxylase. raised csf concentrations of glycine and threonine
(4/5) could be explained by reduced activity of the plpdependent glycine cleavage enzyme and threonine dehydratase, respectively. csf concentrations of histidine and
taurine (4/5) were also increased. plasma and csf concentrations of arginine were low. csf concentrations of pyridoxal
and  xxxd3047xxx  were measured in 3 patients and
were low in all cases.
the  xxxg1793xxx  gene is situated on chromosome 17q21.2. the
newborns with epileptic encephalopathy and the biochemical changes reported above were shown to be homozygous
for missense, splice site and stop codon mutations expression studies showed that the splice site (ivs3−1g>a) and
stop codon (x262q) mutations were null activity mutations
and that the missense mutation (r229w) markedly reduced
pyridox(am)ine-phosphate oxidase activity.

to respond to pyridoxine (but therapeutic trials must be undertaken with great care—see below).
 xxxd3047xxx  for intravenous use is not readily
available. fortunately, plp is very effective when given via a
nasogastric tube (in a sick neonate) or orally following recovery from the seizures. a trial of treatment with plp should
only be undertaken in a setting where full resuscitation and
intensive care facilities are available. in a  xxxg1793xxx -deficient patient, nasogastric administration of 50 mg of plp led to cessation of seizures within an hour, but this was associated with
profound hypotonia and unresponsiveness and also some hypotension. his neurology only normalized after 4 days of
treatment. continuing control of seizures was achieved with
10 mg/kg of plp 6-hourly. without plp treatment,  xxxg1793xxx 
deficiency was rapidly fatal in all affected infants. the one
case who was treated with plp after suffering from severe
seizures for 2 weeks is alive at 2 years 8 months but has severe dystonia, acquired microcephaly and moderate to severe
developmental delay. treatment with l-dopa and carbidopa
was helpful in controlling his dystonic spasms. the effect of
earlier treatment remains to be established.

hypophosphatasia

diagnostic tests
the least-invasive test for  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency is measurement
of urinary vanillyllactate, but the sensitivity and specificity
of this determination in neonates with seizures has yet to be
determined. high csf (and plasma) threonine, and low csf
hva and 5hiaa, with high csf 3-methoxytyrosine are important indicators of possible  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency. a tentative
diagnosis of  xxxg1793xxx  deficiency might be made if a neonate
has seizures that respond dramatically to plp having failed
springer

hypophosphatasia was described by rathbun in 1948. he
reported paradoxically low levels of alkaline phosphatase
(alp) activity in blood and in several tissues of an infant
who died with ‘rickets’ and epilepsy. hypophosphatasia is
now known to be an inborn error of metabolism–deficient activity of the tissue nonspecific isoenzyme of alp ( xxxg148xxx )
caused by deactivating mutations in the  xxxg148xxx  gene (mckusick 171760). waymire and colleagues in 1995 showed that
the  xxxg148xxx  knockout mouse developed fatal seizures shortly
after birth and that these were associated with elevated serum
plp levels and reduced levels of gaba in the brain. seizures

could be prevented by the administration of pyridoxal. several case reports have indicated that some human infants with
hypophosphatasia develop neonatal convulsions with burst
suppression on eeg and/or infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia on eeg (litmanovitz et al 2002; whyte et al 1988).
good responses to treatment have been described with pyridoxine 100 mg intravenously or oral  xxxd3047xxx 
(30 mg/kg per day). affected individuals have high plasma
concentrations of plp (iqbal et al 1998) but low plasma concentrations of pyridoxal (whyte et al 1988). these observations are consistent with the scheme proposed in fig. 1 which
indicates that  xxxg148xxx  is an ecto-enzyme required for the dephosphorylation of circulating plp to form pyridoxal, which
can then enter the brain (and other tissues).

drugs that affect enzymes involved in b6 vitamer
metabolism
in the brain of the seizure-prone gerbil, vigabatrin has been
shown to inhibit pyridox(am)ine oxidase (an et al 2004).
this effect is separate from the known inhibition of gaba
transaminase. enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants probably
increase the rate of catabolism of b6 vitamers. adults on
anti-epileptic medication have hyperhomocysteinaemia and
subnormal plasma concentrations of plp; these can be corrected with a supplement of  xxxd2146xxx , pyridoxine and riboflavin (apeland et al 2002). apeland and colleagues used
a dose of pyridoxine of 2 mg/kg per day but stressed that little
is known about the relative effectiveness of high versus low
doses of pyridoxine hydrochloride in patients on anticonvulsants.
 xxxg1720xxx  is inhibited by methylxanthines (ubbink
et al 1990a); consequently it can be shown that pyridoxal
phosphate levels fall when a patient is given a theophylline

infusion for treatment of asthma (ubbink et al 1990b).
with prolonged treatment with xanthines there is a compensatory increase in  xxxg1720xxx  activity. seizures are
a serious complication of theophylline therapy. in rabbits,
theophylline-induced eeg changes can be reversed with
pyridoxine (glenn et al 1995).

inborn errors causing accumulation of metabolites
that inactivate plp
hyperprolinaemia type ii (1 -pyrroline-5-carboxylate
dehydrogenase deficiency)
in this disorder, mutations in the gene encoding l-1 pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid ( xxxg1905xxx ) dehydrogenase lead to accumulation of  xxxg1905xxx . walker et al (2000) observed xanthurenic
acid in the urine of a child with hyperprolinaemia type ii who
had severe seizures complicating pneumonia. they deduced
that the seizures and increased excretion of xanthurenic acid
might be due to plp deficiency and found that, indeed, the
plasma plp concentration was low. farrant and colleagues
(2001) proposed that plp had been inactivated by reacting
with  xxxg1905xxx  (fig. 3). they showed that  xxxg1905xxx  could indeed react
with plp by a novel condensation reaction. this involved a
claisen condensation (or knoevenagel type of reaction) between the activated c-4 carbon of the pyrroline ring of  xxxg1905xxx 
and the aldehyde carbon of plp.
pyridoxine-responsive epilepsy
pyridoxine-responsive epilepsy (pde) was first described in
1954 (hunt et al 1954). the diagnosis is based on the clinical
observation of cessation of seizures after the administration
of 50–100 mg (rarely 500 mg) of pyridoxine, continuing

seizure control on pyridoxine 10 mg/kg per day and recurrence of fits when the pyridoxine is stopped. the response to
pyridoxine may be dramatic, not only in terms of the seizure
control but also in terms of additional effects that can include
severe unresponsiveness, hypothermia, hypotension and respiratory arrest. these latter effects are more likely if the infant has been treated with anticonvulsants. the eeg prior
to administration of pyridoxine frequently shows burst suppression; 20 min after administration, pyridoxine the eeg
may be flat; after 24 h normal activity can be seen.
pyridoxine dependency is often classified as ‘typical’ or
‘atypical’ (baxter 2001). typical seizures are of perinatal
onset, are refractory to anticonvulsants, respond rapidly to
pyridoxine and recur soon after the pyridoxine is stopped.
atypical pyridoxine dependency is of later onset (up to 2
years); the patient may only respond after repeated administration of pyridoxine and patients may be seizure-free for
up to 5 months when treatment is stopped. additional features that may be seen in infants with pyridoxine dependency
include jitteriness, hypothermia, neonatal dystonia, and a
prodrome of restlessness, irritability and emesis preceding
the seizures. imaging may show cerebellar dysplasia, hemispheric hypoplasia or atrophy, neuronal dysplasia, periventricular hyperintensity, and intracerebral haemorrhage. patients occasionally develop hydrocephalus on follow-up. in
2000, cormier-daire and colleagues mapped the gene for
pde to 5q31.
estimates of the incidence of pde vary considerably. in
one centre in germany where a trial of pyridoxine is a formal
part of the protocol for neonatal seizures, an incidence of 1
in 20 000 has been described (ebinger et al 1999). in the uk
springer

and ireland (where there is considerable variation in the use
of a trial of pyridoxine for neonates and infants with seizures)
a poll of paediatricians suggested an incidence of 1 in 700
000 for definite and probable cases of pde (baxter 2001).
however, there was marked geographical variation, suggesting the possibility of under-recognition and under-reporting.
a similar nationwide survey in the netherlands suggested
an incidence of 1 in 396 000 for definite and probable cases
and 1 in 252 000 when possible cases were included (been
et al 2005).
in 2004, i developed a hypothesis for the pathogenesis
of pde, based on two main observations: (1) the known
ability of plp to react with small molecules (in particular the observations of walker et al (2000) and farrant et
al (2001) on the reaction between plp and  xxxg1905xxx  that occurs in hyperprolinaemia type ii (see above)); and (2) the
observation of increased pipecolic acid concentrations in
csf, plasma and urine of patients with pde (plecko et al
2000). the hypothesis was that pde may be caused by a
defect in the catabolism of pipecolic acid. metabolism of
pipecolic acid occurs via  xxxg1754xxx , which generates 1 -piperideine 6-carboxylate (p6c). p6c is structurally
similar to  xxxg1905xxx  and might be expected to undergo a knoevenagel condensation with plp, with the aldehyde group
of the plp condensing with the activated c5 methylene of
the piperideine ring of p6c. thus, pde might be caused by
a defect in the metabolism of p6c (which is in equilibrium
in solution with alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (alpha-aasa);
fig. 4). the piperideine-6-carboxylate dehydrogenase from
streptomyces clavuligerus had been cloned (perez-llarena
et al 1998). a blast search of the human genome was

j inherit metab dis (2006) 29:317–326

undertaken with an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved between the  xxxg140xxx  of s. clavuligerus
and aldehyde dehydrogenases from caenorhabditis elegans
and pisum sativum (and conserved to a lesser degree in the
pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase from bacillus subtilis) (mills et al 2006). this search led to a single human
gene encoding a protein called antiquitin (because the homology between the protein from humans and that from the
pea suggested it arose early in evolution) (lee et al 1994). the
gene was known as  xxxg140xxx  because of its homology with
other aldehyde dehydrogenases.  xxxg140xxx  mapped to 5q31
(skvorak et al 1997) and this was the known locus for pde
(cormier-daire et al 2000). thus it seemed a good candidate gene. we were able to show that antiquitin is indeed an
alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde/ xxxg140xxx  and that
children with pde have  xxxg140xxx  mutations that abolish
this enzyme activity. we were further able to show that alphaaasa is present in increased concentration in csf, plasma
and urine of children with pde and that p6c can undergo a
knoevenagel condensation with plp at physiological temperature and ph (mills et al 2006).

drugs that react with plp and inactivate it
hydrazines
the  xxxd3047xxx   xxxd2396xxx  complex cannot act as a
cofactor (biehl and vilter 1954) and may also inhibit  xxxg1720xxx  (mccormick and snell 1961).
during isoniazid treatment of tuberculosis, symptomatic
pyridoxine deficiency tends to occur only in patients who
are slow isoniazid inactivators or who have renal insufficiency. the commonest effect is peripheral neuropathy; this
and other side-effects can be prevented by giving pyridoxine
in a dose 50–100 mg of pyridoxine daily (for an adult).
 xxxd2870xxx 
symptomatic pyridoxine deficiency became rare when treatment with d, l- xxxd2870xxx  was replaced by treatment with
d- xxxd2870xxx . nevertheless, most people treating wilson
disease with  xxxd2870xxx  give pyridoxine at a dose of 25
mg daily (for an adult).

inborn errors affecting plp-dependent enzymes
some patients with inborn errors affecting enzymes that use
plp as cofactor are pyridoxine responsive. one obvious explanation could be that these patients have mutations that impair the binding of plp to the enzyme. however, the nature
of the mutations in some pyridoxine-responsive patients ren-

323

ders this explanation unlikely. thus it is important to consider other possible mechanisms. in particular we need to
think about a possible role of plp in assisting protein folding
and/or reducing the likelihood of degradation of misfolded
proteins. for any particular mutation, more than one mechanism may contribute to cofactor responsiveness as shown
by the detailed studies of the molecular basis of tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness in phenylketonuria (erlandsen et al
2004).
 xxxd3047xxx  as chaperone
as early as 1963, greengard and gordon provided evidence indicating that the amount of  xxxg2250xxx  (tat) protein in the liver could be increased by
treatment with pyridoxine. they measured the liver tat activity (using a saturating concentration of plp) before and
4 h after pyridoxine administration. there was a 3-fold rise
in the enzyme activity following b6 administration, and this
increase was blocked by  xxxd3041xxx  and was therefore dependent on protein synthesis. more recently, gross-mesilaty and
colleagues (1997) showed that the increased overall synthesis
of tat in the presence of plp could be explained by reduced
catabolism of nascent protein by the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway. in their model system, tat conjugation and degradation required ubiquitin, atp and the 26s proteasome and
could be inhibited by association of tat with plp.
among the inborn errors affecting enzymes that have
plp as cofactor, there is considerable variation in the proportion of affected patients who are pyridoxine-responsive.
thus, estimates of pyridone responsiveness range from 90%
of patients with deficiency of erythroid delta- xxxd148xxx 
synthase (pyridoxine-responsive anaemia), through 50% of
patients with  xxxg350xxx  deficiency (classical homocystinuria), to 5% of patients with ornithine
delta-aminotransferase deficiency (ornithinaemia with  xxxg1621xxx ) and 0% of patients with tat deficiency (despite the
chaperone effect demonstrated in the rat).
pyridoxine-responsive anaemia
pyridoxine-responsive anaemia (or x-linked sideroblastic
anaemia) is caused by a defect in the erythroid-specific form
of delta- xxxd148xxx   xxxd148xxx  synthase, a plp-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reaction between succinyl-coa and
glycine to produce delta- xxxd148xxx ,  xxxd1739xxx  and
co2 . it usually presents in the second decade of life with a microcytic, hypochromic anaemia with a sideroblastic marrow
and other problems caused by iron overload. improvement
with pyridoxine is usual but may not be seen in patients with
a severe degree of iron overload.
most of the (more than 24) published mutations in the gene
are missense and are in the catalytic domain as opposed to
springer

324

the mitochondrial-targeting or regulatory domains. when the
mutations are expressed in e. coli, they have reduced enzyme
activity that can be increased in the presence of pyridoxine.
in 1979, aoki and colleagues showed that newly synthesized  xxxd148xxx -synthase from patients with pyridoxineresponsive anaemia was more rapidly broken down by
erythroid protease than wild-type enzyme. in 1995, cotter
and colleagues showed that two pyridoxine-responsive patients had reduced apo-enzyme stability.
furuyama and colleagues (1997) studied a patient with
 xxxd148xxx  synthase deficiency who was pyridoxine-resistant.
expression studies suggested that the b6 resistance might be
due to failure of mitochondrial import of the mutant enzyme,
but iron overload may also have contributed to the pyridoxine
resistance of this patient.

order of 80–310 mumol/l in contrast to a figure of 20 mumol/l
in controls. however, the experiments were done in an intact
cell system and it is possible that chaperoning by plp led to
reduced degradation of newly synthesized enzyme and that
this contributed to the increased enzyme activity. molecular
modelling has been used to try to explain pyridoxine responsiveness in oat deficiency. plp is covalently bound to the
lysine-292 residue of the enzyme, but other residues are also
important in noncovalent interactions between the enzyme
and its cofactor. patients with pyridoxine-responsive oat deficiency due to the a226v mutation could have an impaired
interaction between the e230 residue and the 3 -hydroxyl
group of plp. molecular modelling does not provide an explanation for the pyridoxine responsiveness of the v332m
or e318k missense mutations causing b6 -responsive oat
deficiency.

homocystinuria ( xxxg350xxx  deficiency)
 xxxg350xxx  (cbs) catalyses the plpdependent condensation of serine with homocysteine. a defect in this reaction causes classical homocystinuria. in 1967,
barber and spaeth reported 3 patients with cbs deficiency
who responded to very high doses of pyridoxine (250–500
mg daily) with decreases of plasma methionine levels to normal and virtual elimination of homocystine from plasma and
urine. subsequent reports suggested that approximately 50%
of cbs-deficient patients showed a marked or a partial response to pyridoxine in vivo (mudd et al 2001). this effect
may not be detectable if the patient is folate-depleted. the
response tends to be consistent between siblings. in general there is a correlation between residual hepatic enzyme
activity and pyridoxine responsiveness, but there are some
exceptions–individuals with high residual activity and no response to pyridoxine. an interesting observation that suggests the possibility of a chaperone action of plp came from
measurement of cbs activity in liver biopsies from patients
taken before and after in vivo pyridoxine supplementation.
the b6 administration led to 1.3- to 4.5-fold increase in the
hepatic cbs activity (mudd et al 2001).
 xxxg1621xxx  deficiency
plp is the cofactor for  xxxg1621xxx  (oat).
between 1978 and 1981 six patients from 5 sibships were described who showed significant reduction in plasma ornithine
in response to high doses of pyridoxine (500–100 mg/day)
(berson et al 1978, 1981; weleber et al 1978, 1981). weleber
and colleagues found that 15–20 mg/day was as effective as
the higher doses in some of their patients. fibroblast oat activity in these patients increased when high concentrations of
plp were added to the assay medium (kennaway et al 1980).
these experiments suggested that the km for plp in patients
with pyridoxine-responsive oat deficiency might be in the
springer

dangers of an excessive intake of  xxxd3049xxx 
there may be significant differences between pyridoxine and
plp in terms of adverse effects of high doses. supplementation of pyridoxine intake to 1–10 mg/kg per day (for treatment
of premenstrual syndrome) caused subtle neurological symptoms in 60% of the women taking the supplement (dalton and
dalton 1987). objective evidence of dorsal root ganglionopathy has been documented in individuals taking a similar dose
(baxter 2001; bender 1999). in young rats, doses of pyridoxine of 100–400 mg/kg per day given intraperitoneally caused
eeg changes and sometimes frank seizures (veresova et al
1998). six hundred mg/kg twice daily for 3–4 days consistently produced neurotoxicity in rats (levine and saltzman
2004). this effect is exacerbated when the rats are given a
low-protein diet and is not seen with b6 vitamers other than
pyridoxine.
one neonate treated with plp showed an unexpected increase in seizure frequency (hammen et al 1998) and plp injected into the cerebral ventricles of rats can induce seizures
(salazar and tapia 2001). one infant with homocystinuria
treated with  xxxd3047xxx  at a dose of 300 mg/kg per
day showed evidence of hepatotoxicity (yoshida et al 1985).
against these observations it is important to note that both
pyridoxine and plp have been used quite extensively for
treatment of children with idiopathic epilepsy without obvious side-effects (wang et al 2005).
