abstract
h2s functions as a neuromodulator and exerts anti-inflammatory
activities. recent data indicate that irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)
is linked to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. in this study,
we have investigated the role of a novel h2s-releasing derivative
of  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx  4-(5-thioxo-5h[1,2]dithiol-3yl)-phenyl ester, atb-429) in modulating nociception
to colorectal distension (crd), a model that mimics some features
of ibs, in healthy and postcolitic rats. four graded (0.4 –1.6 ml of
water) crds were produced in conscious rats, and colorectal
sensitivity and pain were assessed by measuring the abdominal
withdrawal response and spinal c-fos expression. in healthy rats,
atb-429 dose dependently (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) attenuated
crd-induced hypersensitivity and significantly inhibited crd-induced overexpression of spinal c-fos mrna, whereas  xxxd2579xxx  had no effect. atb-429-induced antinociception was

reversed by  xxxd2215xxx , a atp-sensitive k⫹ (katp) channel
inhibitor. the antinociceptive effect of atb-429 was maintained in
a rodent model of postinflammatory hypersensitivity (4 weeks after
colitis induction). at a dose of 100 mg/kg, atb-429 reversed the
allodynic response caused by crd in postcolitic rats. colonic
 xxxg1884xxx  and interkeukin-1␤ mrna and spinal c-fos
mrna expression were significantly down-regulated by atb-429,
but not by  xxxd2579xxx . atb-429, but not  xxxd2579xxx , increased
blood concentrations of h2s in both healthy and postcolitic rats.
taken together, these data suggest that atb-429 inhibits hypersensitivity induced by crd in both healthy and postcolitic, allodynic rats by a  xxxg1253xxx -mediated mechanism. this study
provides evidence that h2s-releasing drugs might have beneficial
effects in the treatment of painful intestinal disorders.

existence of abdominal pain or discomfort and an alteration
in bowel habit that cannot be explained by a structural or
biochemical abnormality (thompson et al., 1999). although
the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain obscure, psychosocial disturbances, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and altered visceral perception are currently the most
accepted hypothesis.
animal models have provided evidence that inflammationdriven sensory afferent system activation might be a causative factor for development of altered visceral perception.
support for this view comes from the observation that allo-

tities of h2s are produced by these tissues. moreover, h2s
administration inhibits colorectal distension (crd)-induced
pain in healthy and allodynic rats by acting on the katp
channels (distrutti et al., 2006). following these initial results, we have examined the effects of atb-429, a new chemical entity that combines an h2s-releasing moiety with  xxxd2579xxx . here, we have compared the effects of atb-429 to
those of  xxxd2579xxx  in terms of alleviating crd-induced
hypersensitivity in healthy and postcolitic rats.

materials and methods
structure and purity of atb-429. the chemical structure of
 xxxd2579xxx  4-(5-thioxo-5h-[1,2]dithiol-3yl)-phenyl ester (atb-429) is illustrated in fig. 1, whereas key synthetic
steps are shown in supplemental fig. 1. the structure of the atb429 was verified spectroscopically by proton 1h nmr and 14c nmr.
spectra were recorded on varian mercury plus 400 instrument (varian, torino, italy). chemical shifts are referred to me4si as internal
standard. mass spectra of the synthesized products were performed
on api 2000 mass spectrometry (applied biosystems international,
monza, italy). melting point was performed on buchi b-540 instrument (büchi labortechnik ag, flawil, switzerland). purity of the
compound was 98%, as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (varian, torino, italy). 5-p-hydroxyphenyl-1,2-dithione-3thione (adt-oh) (christen, 1995) was used as h2s-releasing moiety
(fig. 1a).
materials.  xxxd228xxx ,  xxxd3159xxx , potassium hydroxide, lcysteine, n- xxxd68xxx , dl-propargylglycine, trichloroacetic
acid, pyridoxal-5⬘-phosphate,  xxxd2982xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2579xxx , and phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from sigma-aldrich (s. louis, mo). adt-oh and atb-429 were provided by
antibe therapeutics inc. (calgary, alberta, canada). tissue protein
extraction reagent t-per was obtained by pierce chemical (rockford, il). all of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used
without treatment. deionized water filtered was used for the buffer
preparation. silver and sulfide ion-selective electrode was from thermoorion (beverly, ma).
animals. male wistar rats (200 –250 g; charles river, monza,
italy) were housed in plastic cages and maintained under controlled
conditions with 12-h light/dark cycles with lights on  xxxd2274xxx :00 am. tap
water and standard laboratory chow were freely available. food was
withheld for 12 h before surgical procedures and crd recordings.
after recovery from surgery, the rats were individually trained by
spending 2 to 3 h per day in a plexiglas cage for 2 to 3 days, which
allowed them to adjust to a movement-restricted environment. all
experimental procedures described below were approved by our institutional animal research committees and were in accordance with
nationally approved guidelines for the treatment of laboratory animals. all experiments were performed in conscious rats and were
conducted in a blinded manner in that the observer was not aware of
the identity or dose of drugs administered to each animal.
surgical procedures. fasting rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg i.p.), and a catheter was inserted into the left
jugular vein. the catheter was externalized subcutaneously through
the dorsal aspect of the neck and protected with a tube attached to
the skin for future access. during procedure, body temperature was
kept constant at 36 –37°c using a homeothermic blanket. animals
exhibiting motor deficits after the surgical procedure were not used
in the experiment. after surgery, rats were housed separately and
allowed to recuperate for at least 5 days before crd testing. rats
were allowed to recover from the surgical procedure for 3 days before
subsequent training in the plexiglas cage.
crd and behavioral testing. the night before experiments the
balloons were inflated and left overnight, so that the latex stretched
and the balloons became compliant. on the testing day, each rat was
sedated with ether inhalation, and a 2-cm-long latex balloon was

dynia and/or hyperalgesia develops in animals after resolution of acute infective (barbara et al., 1997) or chemically
induced (julia et al., 1995; distrutti et al., 2006) colitis, and
by the finding that maternal deprivation-induced visceral
hyperalgesia, a model that involves no direct manipulation of
the colon, is associated with increased myeloperoxidase
(mpo) activity, a measure of colon inflammation (coutinho
et al., 2002). likewise, low-grade inflammation is found in
the colon of ibs patients and is increasingly regarded as a
putative causative factor for symptoms development. support for this concept comes from the following evidence: first,
epidemiological studies have shown that infective gastroenteritis is a risk factor for development of ibs-like symptoms,
and this association is now referred to as postinfective ibs
(garcia-rodriguez and ruigomez, 1999); and second, histological and ultrastructural studies have shown that an increased number of mast cells and t cells are found in the
lamina propria of the ileum and colon of ibs patients in
comparison with healthy subjects (barbara et al., 2006).
moreover, there is evidence that, in these postinflammatory
states, immune cells localize in proximity to nerve endings,
raising the possibility that mediators released from immune
cells might alter enteric nerve function and muscle contractility (barbara et al., 2004). together, these observations
support the concept that ibs is, at least in some patients, the
consequence of the failure of the mucosal immune system to
attenuate inflammatory response after the clearance of an
infectious agent. evidence does exist that genetic factors may
play a role in maintaining intestinal inflammation in specific
subsets of ibs patients (gwee et al., 1996). finally, further
support for a link between inflammation and altered perception is provided by the observation that patients with chronic
inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) develop ibs-like symptoms and visceral hyperalgesia during the quiescent phases
of their diseases (isgar et al., 1983; rao et al., 1987). in these
patients,  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) is
widely used to maintain remission, although it has no effect
in preventing development of ibs-like symptoms.
gaseous transmitters are a growing family of regulatory
mediators involved in regulation of physiological and pathological functions in mammalian tissues (wang, 2002; moore
et al., 2003). although no is the best characterized member
of this family, it is increasingly recognized that co and h2s
also exert regulatory functions (wang, 2002; moore et al.,
2003). h2s regulates key neuronal functions, including the
induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation, a synaptic
model of learning and memory (abe and kimura, 1996), and
the release of the  xxxd1752xxx -releasing hormone from the
hypothalamus (russo et al., 2000). in addition there is evidence that h2s may act as a proinflammatory mediator (bhatia et al., 2005; li et al., 2005). although the molecular
mechanisms involved in these activities are only partially
known, it has been shown that h2s increases camp levels in
neuronal and glial cell lines and primary neuron cultures and
hyperpolarizes dorsal raphe neurons (moore et al., 2003),
contributes to cardioprotection (pan et al., 2006), and affects
insulin secretion from an insulin-secreting cell line (yang et
al., 2005) by activating atp-sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels.
we have recently shown that cystathionine-␤ synthase
(cbs) and cystathionine-␥ lyase (cse), the two major enzymes involved in h2s generation, are constitutively expressed in colon and spinal cord and that measurable quan-

inserted intrarectally 2 cm from the anal verge and fixed at the base
of the tail. the balloon was connected via a double barreled cannula
to a pressure transducer to continuously monitoring the colorectal
pressure by a computer (powerlab pc, adinstruments, milford,
ma) and to a syringe for inflation/deflation of the balloon. the rats
were then housed in a small plexiglas cage (20 ⫻ 8 ⫻ 8 cm) on an
elevated platform and allowed to regain consciousness and adapt for
1 h. after recovery from sedation, the rats underwent the crd
procedure, and behavioral response was tested in all groups except
control group in which no crd was performed. crd of 20 s performed every 5 min was applied in increments of 0.4 ml starting from
0.4 ml and increasing to 1.6 ml of water. animals underwent a
double set of crd. ten minutes after the first crd (0.4 –1.6 ml of
water), drugs were administered i.p. and/or intravenously (i.v.). five
minutes after the end of the drug administration, a second crd was
performed. behavioral responses and colonic parameters collected
during the first and the second sets of crd were assessed and
compared.
the behavioral response to crd was assessed by measuring the
abdominal withdrawal reflex (awr) using a semiquantitative scoring system (al-chaer et al., 2000). the awr is an involuntary motor
reflex similar to the visceromotor reflex, but it has the great advantage that the latter requires abdominal surgery to implant recording
electrodes and wires in the abdominal muscle wall, which may cause
additional sensitization (ness and gebhart, 1990). measurement of
the awr consisted of visual observation of the rat’s response to
graded crd by a blinded observer and assignment of an awr score
according with the behavioral scale described previously (al-chaer
et al., 2000) in which grade 0 corresponds to no behavioral response
to crd, grade 1 corresponds to brief head movement at the onset of
the stimulus followed by immobility, grade 2 corresponds to a mild
contraction of abdominal muscles although the rat does not lift the
abdomen off the platform, grade 3 corresponds to a strong contraction of the abdominal muscles with the lifting of the abdomen off the
platform, and grade 4 corresponds to a severe contraction of the
abdominal muscles manifested by body arching and the lifting of the
abdomen and of the pelvic structures and scrotum. the rats that did
not show any behavioral response (i.e., score 0) were excluded from
further study (approximately 20%). to determine the effect of h2s on
colonic smooth muscle, the compliance of the colon during crd was

obtained from colorectal volume and pressure and expressed as milliliters per mm hg.
effects of atb-429 on colonic hypersensitivity in healthy
rats. the control group (n ⫽ 5) consisted of fasting rats that underwent the surgical procedures but not crd, whereas the crd group
consisted of fasting, healthy animals that underwent surgical procedures and two sets of crd. to investigate whether atb-429 modulates sensitivity and pain induced by crd, rats were treated i.p. with
atb-429 at doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg (atb-429 group),  xxxd2579xxx  at the dose of 100 mg/kg ( xxxd2579xxx  group), or vehicle
(crd group).
the involvement of katp channels in the modulation of visceral
perception by h2s was assessed by pretreating rats with  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxg1253xxx  blocker) at a dose of 2.8 ␮mol/kg i.v. for 20
min before atb-429 administration ( xxxd2215xxx  plus atb-429
group) or  xxxd2215xxx  alone ( xxxd2215xxx  group). at the end of
the crd procedures, rats were sacrificed and blood, colon, and spinal
cord (l1–l5) were collected for further analysis.
induction of colitis. colitis was induced as described previously
(wallace et al., 1989). in brief, rats were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg
i.p. pentobarbital. trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs) at a dose of
20 mg/ml in 0.5 ml of 50% ethanol was administered into the distal
colon by cannula. the rats were monitored daily for loss of body
weight and survival. after 4 weeks, rats still alive were used for a
crd study, as described above. five rats were immediately sacrificed and served as controls (tnbs group). in the other rats, we
performed two consecutive series of crd without administering
drugs (tnbs plus crd group; n ⫽ 5), or we repeated crd after
treatment with atb-429 at a dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. (tnbs plus crd
and atb-429 group; n ⫽ 5) or  xxxd2579xxx  at a dose of 100 mg/kg i.p.
(tnbs plus crd and  xxxd2579xxx  group; n ⫽ 5). at the end of the
crd procedures, rats were sacrificed and blood, colon, and spinal
cord were collected for further analysis.
assessment of colonic inflammation. colons were examined
blindly with a dissecting microscope (5-fold magnification) and
graded for macroscopic lesions on a scale from 0 to 10 based on
criteria for inflammation, such as hyperemia, thickening of the bowel
and the extent of ulceration (wallace et al., 1989). colonic tissue was
taken for measurement of mpo activity, an index of granulocyte
infiltration, as described previously (santucci et al., 1995).

results
atb-429 pharmacokinetics. figure 1b demonstrates
that, in contrast to  xxxd2579xxx , 10 mm atb-429 functions
as an h2s donor. although spontaneous release of h2s occurred in a phosphate-buffered solution, h2s generation was
significantly enhanced by incubating atb-429 with liver homogenates, suggesting that this compound effectively generates h2s both by nonenzymatic and enzymatic activities,
although the nature of the enzymes involved in this process
was not addressed. the amount of h2s released in vitro by
atb-429 was significantly higher than that released by
adt-oh alone.
to investigate whether atb-429 releases h2s in vivo,
plasma h2s concentrations were measured in rats administered 100 mg/kg atb-429 i.p. (fig. 1c). atb-429 increased
plasma h2s concentrations in a time-dependent manner
with a peak occurring 10 min after drug injection (n ⫽ 4 –5;
*, p ⬍ 0.05 versus basal), and concentrations returned to
basal values 60 min later. due to this kinetics, all of the
distension experiments described hereafter were carried out
10 to 30 min after atb-429 administration.
atb-429 does not induce colonic damage. macroscopic examination of the colon revealed that the inflammation scores after crd alone or crd plus drug administration
were similar to those of control group (data not shown).
moreover, mpo activity in colonic tissue during crd was
similar to that of the control group, indicating that crd did
not produce a significant colonic inflammatory response. administration of  xxxd2579xxx , atb-429, or  xxxd2215xxx  did
not significantly affect colonic mpo activity (data not
shown).

in vitro h2s release. to compare the in vitro h2s release
induced by  xxxd2579xxx , atb-429, and adt-oh, the h2s-releasing
moiety of atb-429, 100 to 150 mg of isolated livers was homogenized
in 1 ml of ice-cold t-per protein extractor. the h2s release was lead
on the same reactor of plasma analysis. two milliliters of an assay
reaction mixture was introduced in the reactor. the mixture contained 10 mm atb-429 or 10 mm adt-oh dissolved in polyethylene
glycol and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4. incubations
were lead with or without presence of 10% (w/v) liver homogenate
and 2 mm pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate. a constant stream of nitrogen was
passed through the mixture via gas inlet capillary. reactions were
initiated by transferring the tube from ice bath to a 37°c water bath.
the stream of nitrogen carried the sulfide acid into the second
reactor containing 2 ml of sulfide antioxidant buffer (saob) as
described previously. after incubating at 37°c for 90 min, 1 ml of
50% trichloroacetic acid solution was added to the mixture to stop
the reaction. the remainder h2s in the mixture was carried out via
nitrogen stream by another 30 min of incubation at 37°c. the concentration of sulfide in the saob solution was measured with a
sulfide-sensitive electrode as described previously (khan et al., 1980;
ubuka, 2002).
measurement of plasma h2s concentrations. to determine
the kinetics of h2s released from atb-429, groups of four to five rats
were treated with atb-429 at the dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. and sacrificed after 10, 30, 60, and 180 min. a time-course curve of plasma
h2s concentrations was then constructed. plasma h2s concentrations were measured as described previously (zhao et al., 2001;
ubuka, 2002) with modifications. in brief, 250 ␮l of plasma was
added to ice-cold 250 ␮l of 0.1 n naoh in a sealed three-neck reactor.
a constant stream of nitrogen was passed through the mixture via a
gas inlet capillary. the reactor was maintained at 37°c, and h2s
extraction was started by introducing 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid
solution. the stream of nitrogen carried the sulfide acid in another
reactor by cooled connector and bubbling in 2 ml of saob solution,
consisting of 2 m koh, 1 m  xxxd3159xxx , and 0.22 m  xxxd228xxx 
at ph 12.8. after 30 min, the saob solution was removed, and the
sulfide concentration was measured with a sulfide-sensitive electrode (model 9616 s2⫺/ag⫹ electrode; thermoorion) and expressed
as h2s (khan et al., 1980; ubuka, 2002).
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on colonic and spinal tissues. whether acute administration of atb429 could modulate the expression of genes that participate in the
control of inflammation and pain was studied by determining the
colonic and spinal cord expression of mrna of cbs, cse, c-fos,
cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 and -2,  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-␣, interleukin (il)-1␤, constitutive no synthase (cnos), calcitonin generelated peptide (cgrp), and takikinin (tac)-1 and -2 in postcolitic
rats. in brief, total rna was isolated from rat colon and spinal cord
by using the trizol reagent according to manufacturer’s specifications (invitrogen, milan, italy). rna was processed directly to cdna
by reverse transcription with superscript ii (invitrogen). two micrograms of rna was added to a mixture of 10⫻ dnase i reaction buffer
and 1 u of dnase i. the mix was incubated 15 min at room temperature, and then 4 ␮l of 5⫻ first strand buffer (250 mm tris-hcl, ph
8.3, 375 mm kcl, and 15 mm mgcl2), 2 ␮l of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 2
␮l of 10 mm dntps mixture, 1 ␮l of random primers at 300 ng/␮l, 0.5
␮l of rnase out, and 0.5 ␮l of superscript ii were added to the
sample. the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min
and at 42°c for 50 min, heated at 95°c for 5 min to inactivate the
enzyme, and cooled at 4°c. all polymerase chain reaction primers for
quantitative and qualitative polymerase chain reaction were synthesized by mwg biotech (high point, nc) and designed using software
primer3-new using published sequence data from the national
center for biotechnology information database. table 1 illustrates
the rat primers (sense and antisense) used in this study. in control
experiments with three replicates, no false positives were detected.

healthy rats. in all experiments, two sequential distension-effect curves were constructed. the first distension-effect curve acted as basal, and the second curve was constructed following vehicle or drug administration. in all
experiments, rats were conscious, and none of the treatments
induced changes in the state of consciousness. crd elicited
volume-dependent increases in the awr score, which were
rapid in onset and persisted for the duration of the distension
period (fig. 2a) with no significant reduction in colorectal
pressure (fig. 2b). distensions with 0.4 ml of water induced
a slight increase of the awr score (less than 1) that was

451

associated with a small rise of colorectal pressure (⬇20 mm
hg), indicating that this crd represents a nonpainful stimulus. distensions with 1.2 and 1.6 ml of water were associated with greater awr scores (3 and 4, respectively) and
with a high colorectal pressures (up to 80 mm hg), indicating
that these volumes induced noxious sensations (ji and

comitant increase in rectal compliance (fig. 2f). the antinociceptive effects of atb-429 during crd were confirmed by
analysis of c-fos expression in the spinal cord. quantitative
rt-pcr of c-fos mrna expression demonstrates that crd
induced a 2-fold increase in spinal c-fos expression that was
not modified by  xxxd2579xxx . administration with atb-429
abrogated c-fos mrna induction caused by crd, suggesting
that the reduced awr score was due to the antinociceptive
effect of the h2s moiety of atb-429, rather than the  xxxd2579xxx  component of the new molecule (fig. 2g).
the antinociceptive effect of atb-429 was dose-dependent,
because it was maximal at the dose of 100 mg/kg (fig. 3a), it
was maintained at the dose of 50 mg/kg (fig. 3c), but it was
not apparent at the dose of 25 mg/kg (fig. 3e). the relaxant
effect was demonstrated only at the highest dose (fig. 3, b, d,

 xxxg1253xxx  blockade reverses the antinociceptive effect of atb-429. to determine whether atp-sensitive k⫹ channels were involved in the antinociceptive effects
of atb-429, the interaction of atb-429 with a known katp
channel modulator was examined. the inhibitory effect of
atb-429 on crd-induced pain was reversed by pretreating
rats with  xxxd2215xxx , a  xxxg1253xxx  antagonist (fig. 4a),
and this effect was accompanied by inhibition of colonic
smooth muscle relaxation (fig. 4b). in contrast, treating rats
with  xxxd2215xxx  alone had no effect on crd-induced nociception or colonic compliance (data not shown). analysis of
c-fos expression demonstrated that pretreatment with  xxxd2215xxx  reversed the antinociceptive effect of atb-429
(fig. 4c). plasma h2s concentrations did not significantly
change during  xxxg1253xxx  modulator pretreatment (data

atb-429 inhibits pain in allodynic rats. colitic rats
exhibited a 20% reduction of body weight compared with
healthy rats, and diarrhea was observed during the first week
after induction of colitis. four weeks after induction of colitis,
colonic mpo activity was not significantly increased in tnbstreated rats in comparison with controls (fig. 5a), indicating
that inflammation was almost resolved. these data were confirmed by the analysis of the macroscopic inflammatory score
that demonstrated that only thickening of bowel wall was observed in tnbs-treated rats compared with controls, whereas
hyperemia and ulceration had disappeared (fig. 5b).
when crd was performed 4 weeks after induction of colitis, a significant increase in the awr score was observed in
comparison with healthy rats. as shown in fig. 6a, an increased nociception was observed during the low-volume (0.4
and 0.8 ml of water) and high-volume (1.2 ml of water)
distensions, indicating that colonic inflammation induces allodynia (perception of nonpainful stimulus as painful) and
hyperalgesia (perception of painful stimulus as more painful)

to crd. interestingly, colonic compliance of postcolitic rats
was also significantly lower than that of control animals (fig.
6b), probably due to the fibrotic evolution of the colitis. the
awr score and colonic compliance in response to repeated
crds and crd ⫹  xxxd2579xxx  (100 mg/kg i.p.) did not
change (fig. 6, c and d, respectively), whereas pretreating
colitic rats with 100 mg/kg i.p. atb-429 almost completely
inhibited the allodynic response to crd (fig. 6e) without
modifying the colonic compliance (fig. 6f). the expression of
c-fos mrna in the spinal cord was greatly increased in the
colitic rats after crd, indicating the presence of a painful
condition after induction of colitis. the administration of
atb-429, but not of  xxxd2579xxx , reduced c-fos mrna expression to values similar to that of controls (fig. 6g).

cbs and cse mrna, which was not modified by atb-429

an overexpression of cox-1, cox-2, tnf␣, il-1␤, and cnos
mrnas that was not modified by crd or  xxxd2579xxx  administration (fig. 9), whereas atb-429 significantly inhibited the colonic expression of cox-2 and il-1␤ (fig. 9, b and

increased cgrp, tac-1, and tac-2 mrna expression in the
colon that was not modified by  xxxd2579xxx  or atb-429 administration (data not shown).

tnbs-induced colonic inflammation did not modify spinal

rectal hypersensitivity. these effects are produced, at least in
part, through katp channels. atb-429 is a new chemical
entity consisting of an h2s-releasing moiety (a thione group)
linked to  xxxd2579xxx , a known anti-inflammatory agent,
and, it is noteworthy that a 100-mg/kg dose of atb-429
delivers only ⬃38 mg/kg  xxxd2579xxx . here, we provide evidence that atb-429 is significantly more effective than  xxxd2579xxx  in reducing nociception caused by colonic distension in intact and allodynic rats. the antinociceptive action of
the atb-429 was dose-dependent, and at the higher doses
tested (50 and 100 mg/kg), it significantly decreased the
awr score following repetitive noxious and non-noxious
crd. antinociceptive activities of atb-429 did not correlate
with changes in colorectal compliance, because a significant
decrease of colorectal compliance was observed only with the

highest dose (100 mg/kg), whereas lower doses had no relaxant effect on colonic smooth muscle cells.
several of our data support the hypothesis that the antinociceptive effects of atb-429 are due to its h2s moiety. first,
 xxxd2579xxx  itself was only marginally effective in controlling pain in the model. second, atb-429, but not  xxxd2579xxx , releases h2s in vitro, and it does the same in vivo,
with a peak of plasma h2s concentration occurring rapidly
(10 –30 min) after i.p. administration (100 mg/kg). third, two
pharmacological actions of atb-429, antinociception and reduction of c-fos expression in the spinal cord, were reversed
by  xxxd2215xxx , a  xxxg1253xxx  inhibitor (edwards and
weston, 1993; distrutti et al., 2006). several h2s activities
have been shown to be mediated via katp channels (wang,
2002), and this finding is consistent with our previous observation demonstrating that antinociception exerted by h2s is
 xxxd2215xxx -sensitive (distrutti et al., 2006). katp channels are expressed in many excitable cells, including skeletal
and smooth muscle cells as well as neurons from both central
and peripheral nervous system. because these receptors are
not discriminated by  xxxd2215xxx , the use of this agent does
not allow for identification of the site of action of atb-429
(central versus peripheral) and deserves further investigation.

inflammation, abnormal pain responses to crd have been
observed, demonstrating that inflammation induces both hyperalgesia and allodynia that persist when local inflammation is partially or totally resolved. human studies in patients with ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease (bernstein
et al., 1996; chang et al., 2000) and ibs (collins et al., 2001)
have confirmed that colonic inflammation modulates colonic
neural afferents. in the present study, an elevated awr
score was observed in postcolitic rats in response to lowvolume distension (0.4 and 0.8 ml of water), confirming that
tnbs-induced inflammation causes allodynia. moreover, cfos mrna expression was increased in postcolitic rats in
comparison with healthy controls, suggesting that colonic
inflammation activates a population of second order spinal
cord neurons (traub et al., 1992). of interest, atb-429 completely reversed the allodynic effect of colonic inflammation
and down-regulated c-fos mrna expression in the spinal
cord.
several inflammatory and noninflammatory mediators are
thought to be involved in the hyperalgesia and/or allodynia
observed in postinflammatory states. here, we found that
colonic expression of cox-1, cox-2, tnf-␣, il-1␤, cnos,
cgrp, tac-1, and tac-2 increased in postcolitic rats in
comparison with healthy rats. previous studies have associated the increased expression of these mediators with development of hypersensitivity, and their mechanistic role has

been investigated by pharmacological and genetic approaches (abbadie, 2005). the development of hypersensitivity in postinflammatory states supports the notion that inflammation induces long-lasting changes in the mechanisms
underlying visceral pain. structural and molecular changes
take place in the colon of ibs patients and along with the
demonstration that ibs-like symptoms develop in postinfectious colitis, these data support the notion that intestinal
inflammation plays a crucial role in precipitating ibs symptoms in susceptible individuals (sartor, 1994). further supporting the link between inflammation and ibs, il-1␤ has
been found to be elevated in the colonic mucosa of a subset of
diarrhea-predominant ibs patients (sartor, 1994), and
cox-2 is up-regulated in animal model in which transient
acute infection leads to persistent muscle hypercontractility
(akiho et al., 2005). moreover, it has been demonstrated that
il-1␤ induces spinal cox-2 up-regulation and pain hypersensitivity following peripheral inflammation (lee et al.,
2004). in the present study, we have shown that colon expression of il-1␤ and cox-2 mrna was persistently increased after tnbs-induced inflammation and that atb429, but not  xxxd2579xxx , reduced the colonic expression of
these mediators. previous studies have shown that h2s exerts anti-inflammatory activities and, similar to no, reduces
neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells in the mesenteric
circulation (fiorucci et al., 2005), suggesting that the h2s-

releasing moiety contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects
of this compound (fiorucci et al., 2006).
the mechanism(s) through which atb-429 exerts its antinociceptive activities remains to be identified, although several explanations could be taken into consideration. first,
because high concentrations of h2s are neurotoxic, one might
speculate that h2s released by atb-429 alters rat consciousness, a situation that mimics a pain-free condition during
crd (distrutti et al., 2006). this explanation, however, is
unlikely, because concentrations required for neurotoxic effects by h2s are significantly higher than that measured in
our experimental setting. plasma and brain levels of h2s in
healthy rats range from 10 to 160 ␮m (wang, 2002), whereas
neurotoxic effects (inhibition of synaptic transmission in the
hippocampus) occur at concentrations ⬎320 ␮m (abe and
kimura, 1996). not only did atb-429 have no effect on the
rat consciousness but also plasma h2s concentrations measured in rats administered 100 mg/kg atb-429 (the higher
dose used in this study) never exceed 60 to 70 ␮m. second,
because h2s causes smooth muscle relaxation (zhao et al.,
2001), the antinociceptive activities of atb-429 might be due
to an increase in colorectal compliance. however, this is also
an unlikely explanation, because atb-429 maintains its analgesic action also at a dose (50 mg/kg) that fails to decrease
colorectal tone. moreover, in the postcolitic model in which
atb-429 is powerfully analgesic, the colorectal compliance
that is persistently reduced in comparison with healthy rats
as a consequence of colonic fibrosis induced by tnbs is not
affected by this agent. third, atb-429 might modulate inflammation in the colon. although inflammation results in
enhanced nociception and its reversal attenuates perception
of painful stimuli, and atb-429 exerts anti-inflammatory
activities in rodent models of colitis, it is unlikely that antiinflammation by itself explains all its antinociceptive activities. in support to this concept, we have shown that 1) atb429 is antinociceptive also in healthy rats, where no
inflammation is detectable; 2) in both healthy and postcolitic
rats, atb-429 is antinociceptive after a single dose; and 3) in
the postcolitic model, atb-429 was administered 4 weeks
after the induction of colitis, when the inflammatory process
was largely resolved. fourth, a likely explanation of the
antinociceptive activity of atb-429 might deal, therefore,
with the ability of atb-429 to modulate neurotransmission
of painful stimuli. support to this concept comes from the
observation that antinociceptive activity of atb-429 associates with significantly inhibition of crd-induced spinal cfos expression. because induction of this gene by crd is a
marker of activation of second order spinal cord neurons
(traub et al., 1992), its reversal by atb-429 supports a direct
modulatory function on these neurons. the findings that
 xxxd2579xxx  fails to modulate c-fos expression in this experimental setting and that effects of atb-429 on c-fos are
reversed by  xxxd2215xxx  support a role for katp channels
on the afferent, sensitive spinal fibers.
in summary, we have shown that systemic administration
of atb-429 reduces visceral sensitivity and pain perception
in conscious healthy and postcolitic, hypersensitive, rats. the
neurophysiological basis for these actions seems to be dependent on the h2s-releasing moiety of atb-429 and might
involve katp channels on afferent, sensitive spinal fibers. in
addition, atb-429 modulates expression of colonic proinflammatory mediators such as cox-2 and il-1␤. whether
