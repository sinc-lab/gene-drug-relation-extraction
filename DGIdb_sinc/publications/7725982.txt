 xxxd2622xxx  - an orally active histamine h2-receptor antagonist

histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion
can be antagonized in animals [i] and in man [2]
by burimamide given intravenously. this effect
appears to be related to the specific blockade of
histamine h2-receptors by burimamide which
was demonstrated on certain tissues in vitro [1].
potential clinical interest was aroused by the
finding that burimamide also inhibited gastric
acid secretion evoked by  xxxd2873xxx  or gastrin.
however, because of difficulties found in studying
the oral effectiveness of burimamide in experimental animals, no proposal for its clinical
evaluation was made. a new compound,  xxxd2622xxx , has now been developed which has
properties suitable for evaluation of the therapeutic potential of histamine h2-receptor blockade in man, namely, high specific activity, low
toxicity and good oral bioavailability.

chemistry of  xxxd2622xxx 
 xxxd2622xxx  is the approved name for n-methyl-n'- {2 [(5-methylimidazol-4-yl) methylthio]ethyl}thiourea. as shown in figure 1  xxxd2622xxx 
was developed from burimamide by replacing a
pka(37~

methylene group (-ch2-) with an isosteric thios
ether ( - s - ) link in the side chain and by the addition of a methyl group in the imidazole ring.
these changes alter the electron densities of the
ring nitrogens and were introduced to make the
preferred tautomer of the imidazole ring similar
to that found in histamine in solution. these
changes also alter the ionisation and lipid solubility of the compound and hence may influence
its absorption from the intestine. thus the pka
for  xxxd2622xxx  of 6.8 implies that when the ph
is below 4 in the stomach almost all the molecules
will be charged due to protonation of the
imidazole ring but when the ph approaches
neutrality in the small intestine about half of the
molecules will now be uncharged. since uncharged molecules are much more lipid soluble
than charged ones the lipid solubility ofmetiamide
at ph 7 is over 40 times greater than at ph 4.
the molecular weight of  xxxd2622xxx  is 244.4.

the imidazole ring can exist as two tautomers depending
on which of the ring nitrogen atoms carries a proton
(h+). the preferred tautomer in burimamide is opposite
to that found in histamine. in  xxxd2622xxx  the preferred
tautomer is the same as that found in histamine.

 xxxd2622xxx  - a histamine h~-receptor antagonist

~zmole kg -1 can be roughly converted to mg kg -1
by dividing by 4.

 xxxd2622xxx  was given by rapid intravenous injection during a maximal plateau of histaminestimulated acid secretion and any reduction in
secretion was expressed as a percentage of the
preceding maximal level. using doses from 0.5
to 64 tzmole kg -1 in rats and from 1 to 4 [xmole
kg -~ in dogs, estimates of the dose needed to
produce 5 0 ~ inhibition (eds0) were measured
in each species. the results are shown in the
table. the corresponding estimates for burimamide were 6.1 ~zmole kg -1 in the rat preparation
and 19 ~tmole kg -1 in the dog preparation.
 xxxd2622xxx  is therefore approximately 4-6 times
more active than burimamide in dogs and rats
as an inhibitor of maximal histamine-stimulated
acid secretion.
estimates of the eds0 for  xxxd2622xxx  as an
inhibitor of maximum  xxxd2873xxx -stimulated
acid secretion were made using the same techniques and the results are also shown in the table.
as with burimamide, the eds0 values for
 xxxd2622xxx  are of the same order of magnitude
against both histamine and  xxxd2873xxx . however, in the rat, the eds0 against  xxxd2873xxx  is
significantly greater than against histamine. the
two values in the dog are not significantly different hut the confidence region for  xxxd2873xxx 
is very wide, so the biological significance of
these differences is doubtful.
as was found with burimamide, doses of
 xxxd2622xxx  up to 64 ~zmole kg -1 i.v. did not inhibit carbachol-stimulated secretion in rats. in
dogs with heidenhain pouches, carbachoistimulated secretion was inhibited by intravenous
injection of 8 ~mole kg -1 of  xxxd2622xxx  but
continuous intravenous infusion of 10 ~tmole
kg -1 min -1 of  xxxd2622xxx , which was highly
effective against histamine and  xxxd2873xxx , did
not inhibit the effects of carbachol.

antagonism of histamine h2-receptors in vitro
the pharmacological receptors which mediate the effects of histamine on guinea-pig heart
muscle or rat uterine muscle in vitro have been
defined as histamine h2-receptofs [1 ].  xxxd2622xxx 
quantitatively suppresses the effects of histamine
on these tissues as would be expected from a
competitive antagonist of these receptors. the
concentration of  xxxd2622xxx  (with 9 5 ~ confidence limits) needed to occupy half of the receptors at equilibrium (kb) [3] was found to be
9.2 (7.4-11.5)• 10-7m on atrial muscle and 7.5
(4.0-13.6) • 10-tm on uterine muscle.
on these tissue preparations  xxxd2622xxx  is
thus about 10 times more active than burimamide
which has a kn of 7.8 (6.4-9.6) • 10-tm on atria.
the specificity of this antagonism was shown by
the inability of  xxxd2622xxx , even at a concentration of 10-zm, to inhibit the effects ofisoprenaline
on either tissue; like histamine,  xxxd2398xxx 
increases atrial contraction frequency and inhibits contractions of rat uterus.
the histamine receptors in guinea-pig ileum
have been classified as hz-receptors [4].  xxxd2622xxx , even at a concentration of lo-sm, did not
produce specific, competitive, blockade of these
receptors.
inhibition of gastric acid secretion: intravenous
dosing
the present hypothesis is that histamine
stimulates gastric acid secretion by activating
he-receptors. by extrapolation from the in vitro
measurements,  xxxd2622xxx  should antagonise
histamine-stimulated gastric acid in vivo.
the effectiveness of  xxxd2622xxx  as an
antagonist of gastric acid secretion was estimated
both in anaesthetized rats, using a lumen-perfused stomach preparation [1], and in conscious
dogs, using the heidenhain pouch technique.

dosing were obtained using the same procedures
in heidenhain-pouch dogs. doses of 10, 20 and
40 ~mole kg -1 p.o. were used. the time course of
the inhibition is shown in figure 2. peak inhibition was reached between 75 and 105 minutes
after dosing. percentage inhibition for each dose
at maximum response (mean 4- s.e.m.) was
31~2 4.2, 55.8 • 6.0 and 81.1 • 6.1, respectively.

so far, only doses of 40 [xmole kg -1  xxxd2622xxx  (fig. 2) have been given orally to dogs
maximally-stimulated by  xxxd2873xxx . this dose
produced a mean percentage inhibition of

the effect of orally-dosed  xxxd2622xxx  has
also been studied in a small colony of rats
prepared with gastric fistulae. even after food
has been withdrawn for 24 hours these animals
still show a high level of basal secretion (fig. 3)
and histamine, 2 mg per rat subcutaneously,
produces only a 70 % increase in total acid output. this histamine response was completely
blocked by 160 [zmole kg -1 p.o.  xxxd2622xxx . however, this dose also produced a highly significant
reduction of basal secretion so that the histamine
response could probably have been reduced by
much smaller doses of  xxxd2622xxx . a larger dose,

10 ~mole rain -1 for 90 minutes, produced a
maximum plasma level (mean • s.e.m.) of
7.4 4- 1.8 f m in the histamine-treated subjects
and 8.3 4- 0.8 ~xm in those treated with  xxxd2873xxx . corresponding to these plasma levels
maximum inhibition of total acid output did not

87 4- 8% using  xxxd2873xxx . as shown in
figure 4 the inhibition of total acid output was
due to a reduction in both the volume and
acidity of the juice.

agonist. degree of inhibition was assessed by
comparison with control tests done on the same
subjects when agonist alone was given. 30 minutes
after starting the agonist infusion (that is 60
minutes after dosing with met•177
an average
of 60% inhibition was estimated. an average
plasma level of 4 ~tm was measured 45 minutes
after dosing in these subjects. in one subject,
illustrated in figure 5, met•177

during the plateau of maximal  xxxd2873xxx

for 15 minutes only. nevertheless a peak plasma
level of 4.3 ~tm was reached 15 minutes after
dosing and 78% inhibition of secretion was
calculated 30 minutes after dosing.

toxicity
in sub-acute toxicity tests in the rat and
dog the kidney has been shown to be the major
target organ. in rats given  xxxd2622xxx  1500 ~mole
kg -1 p.o. daily for 3 months the histological
changes in the kidney were nuclear enlargement,
flattening of epithelial cells lining the tubules and
tubular hyperplasia. these changes were not
considered to be severe and were not dissimilar
to those reported following sulphonamide
administration; no deposition of drug was found
in the tubules. in dogs given  xxxd2622xxx  a t
700 [zmole kg -1 p.o. daily for 90 days the changes
were more extensive and 2/6 dogs sacrificed
before the end of the experiment had severe
tubular necrosis. of the dogs surviving until the
end of the experiment 1/6 had tubular necrosis,
2/6 had evidence of histological changes and 1/6
had normal kidneys. no evidence of kidney

damage was observed in 6 dogs receiving 975
~mole kg -i daily for 30 days.
barely detectable histological changes were
reported in the thyroid of both the rat and dog
after 90 days dosing and there was no clinical
evidence of anti-thyroid activity.
although met•177
was shown to have no
marked generalized effect on the haemopoietic
system, leukopenia was observed in three dogs,
two of which had been dosed at 350 ~mole kg -1
daily for 3 months. on stopping administration
of the drug the granulocyte count rapidly returned to within its normal range. on present
evidence this granuiocyte leukopenia does not
appear to be associated with depression of the
bone marrow.
daily infusions of met•177
to the rat
(1500 ~tmole kg -1 per day for 14 days) and dog
(180 ~tmole kg 1 per day for 6 days) produced no
tissue changes or local reactions.
in the rat and rabbit met•177
had no
teratogenic activity.

abstract
 xxxd2622xxx  has been found to be about 10 times more
active than burimamide in vitro in antagonizing histamine
h2-receptors and nearly 5 times more active in vivo as an
antagonist of histamine or  xxxd2873xxx -stimulated secretion. effective oral eds0 doses for inhibition have been
estimated as 25 ~mole kg -1 against basal secretion in rats
and 16 ~mole kg 1 against maximal histamine-stimulated
secretion in dogs. administration of  xxxd2622xxx  orally daily
for 90 days with doses of 1,500 ~mole kg -1 to rats and
700 smole kg -1 to dogs produced signs of kidney damage
as the dominant lesion in both species. these toxic doses
are roughly 60 and 44 times greater than the ed50 doses
in the rat and dog, respectively. these results show that
 xxxd2622xxx  has the degree of activity and safety needed for
a compound to be a candidate for thorough clinical evaluation.
