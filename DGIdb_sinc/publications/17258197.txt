abstract
prostanoid production depends on the activity of two cyclooxygenase (cox) isoforms. it is appreciated that cox-1 plays a role in physiological
processes, whereas cox-2 acts in pathological conditions. however their roles, particularly roles of cox-1, have not yet been fully established in
inflammation. here, we examined the effects of cox inhibitors, having differential isoform selectivity, on the late phase of rat carrageenin-induced
pleurisy to elucidate the role of cox-2 expressed in the draining lymph nodes and found substantial contribution of cox-1-product(s). protein and
mrna of cox-2 were detectable with western blotting analysis and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis in parathymic
lymph nodes, peaking at 48 h after induction of pleurisy. microsomal  xxxg1876xxx  ( xxxg1876xxx )-1 was detectable by immunohistochemical
analysis in cells with dendritic processes, a morphological characteristic similar to that of cox-2 expressing cells. although aspirin, indomethacin and a
cox-1 inhibitor, ketorolac, significantly decreased the volume of pleural exudate, they did not affect the levels of cox-2 and  xxxg1876xxx  in the lymph
node 24 h after induction of pleurisy. in contrast, cox-2 inhibitors,  xxxd2727xxx  and ns-398, had no effect on the exudate volume, but they increased the
number of cox-2- and  xxxg1876xxx -expressing cells and extension of their dendritic processes with significant increase in the cox-2 level, which were
antagonised by ketorolac. these results suggest that cox-2-expressing cells may negatively self-regulate their functions by producing pge2 via
 xxxg1876xxx : migration into the draining lymph node and their differentiation. moreover, cox-1- and cox-2-derived prostanoids may play differential or
sometimes antagonistic roles in the late phase of acute inflammation.

of reproduction, neurotransmitter release as well as modulation
of immune and inflammatory responses. prostanoids are
produced when  xxxd208xxx  is released from the plasma
membrane by  xxxg1759xxx  and metabolised by cyclooxygenases (coxs) and specific terminal pg synthases. prostanoid production depends on the activity of the two cox
isoforms within cells. cox-1 is present in most cells and its
expression is generally constitutive. in contrast, cox-2
expression is low or undetectable in most cells, but its expression
increases dramatically upon stimulation. pgh2 is produced by

m. nakano et al. / european journal of pharmacology 559 (2007) 210–218

both cox isoforms and is the common substrate for a series of
cell-specific terminal pg synthases that produce  xxxg1073xxx , pge2,
pgf2, pgi2 and txa2 (samuelsson et al., 1978; moncada and
vane, 1979; simmons et al., 2004). recently the genes encoding
the terminal synthase enzymes involved in converting pgh2 to
each of the pgs, including the pge synthase ( xxxg1876xxx ), have been
cloned and characterised (helliwell et al., 2004). at least three
distinct  xxxg1876xxx  isoforms have been identified, including cytosolic
 xxxg1876xxx  ( xxxg1877xxx ), microsomal  xxxg1876xxx -1 ( xxxg1876xxx ) and mpges2. among these  xxxg1876xxx  isoforms,  xxxg1876xxx  has received much
attention. because stimulation of various cultured cells with
proinflammatory stimuli leads to a marked elevation of mpges1 expression with a concomitant elevation of cox-2 expression
and pge2 production (murakami et al., 2000). in addition,
overexpression of  xxxg1876xxx  in in vivo models of inflammation
is much more robust and prolonged than that of cox-2 (ivanov
et al., 2002).
it is well known that constitutive cox-1 plays a role in the
generation of pg, which regulates physiological processes such
as gastrointestinal cytoprotection, vascular homeostasis and
renal function, whereas inducible cox-2 is thought to act in
pathological processes such as inflammation. in fact, cox-2
has been detected in inflammatory sites in carrageenin-induced
pleurisy (harada et al., 1994; tomlinson et al., 1994), air-pouch
(masferrer et al., 1994) and paw oedema (seibert et al., 1994) in
the rat, and in mouse adjuvant-induced air-pouch (vane et al.,
1994). furthermore, its expression has been demonstrated in
human synovial tissues derived from patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (crofford et al., 1994).
conventional cox inhibitors, such as aspirin and indomethacin, are widely used as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs for relief from pain, fever and swelling, which are acutephase symptoms of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. they inhibit the activities of
both cox-1 and cox-2, almost equally or slightly selective for
cox-1. it has been suggested that the anti-inflammatory action
of conventional cox inhibitors is due to inhibition of cox-2
and that their harmful effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa are
due to the blockage of cox-1 activity. this association of
cox-2 with inflammatory events led to the development of
selective cox-2 inhibitors that are expected to display systemic
anti-inflammatory properties while avoiding gastrointestinal
toxicity (vane et al., 1998; vane, 2000). under these
circumstances, the contribution of cox-1 in inflammation is
not yet fully elucidated. in recent years, however, gilroy et al.
(1998a,b) suggested substantial contribution of cox-1-derived
prostanoids in models of chronic inflammation and the early
phase of acute inflammation.
using rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy as a model for acute
inflammation, we found in previous studies that pge2 produced
via cox-2 expressed in infiltrating leukocytes is involved in
plasma exudation in the early phase (3–7 h) (harada et al., 1994,
1996). furthermore, we suggested that cox-2 expressed in
pleural mesothelial cells may be involved via production of pgi2
in extracellular matrix formation in the same model (9–24 h)
(hatanaka et al., 1999). more recently, the authors reported
expression of cox-2 in parathymic lymph nodes in the late

211

phase (14–48 h) of this model (fujisawa et al., 2005). in the
present study, we examined the effects of cox inhibitors,
having differential isoform selectivity, on the late phase of rat
carrageenin pleurisy to further elucidate the role of cox-2
expressed in the draining lymph nodes and we found substantial
contribution of cox-1 product(s) in the late phase of acute
inflammation.
2. materials and methods
2.1. carrageenin-induced pleurisy
all experiments were approved by the institutional animal
care and use committee and performed according to the
guideline for animal experimentation of kitasato university
(sagamihara, japan). pleurisy was induced in male sprague–
dawley rats (9–10 weeks old, specific pathogen-free), purchased from charles river japan, inc. (yokohama, japan), by
intrapleural injection of 0.2 ml of 2% lambda-carrageenin (sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa) under light ether anesthesia
(harada et al., 1996). at a given time, the rats were euthanized
under ether anesthesia. and then, the pleural exudate was
harvested and its volume was determined. the cells in the
pleural exudate were enumerated using an improved neubauer
cell counting plate after staining with türk's solution (sigma–
aldrich japan, tokyo, japan). zero-h means samples from
normal control rats.
parathymic and axillary lymph nodes were dissected from
pleurisy rats and normal control rats and then washed with
10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2, pbs). for pcr
analysis, the lymph nodes were stored in rna later™ (ambion,
austin, tx, usa) at − 20 °c. for western blotting analysis, the
lymph nodes were dissected with scissors. cells in the lymph
nodes were washed out with pbs, collected by centrifugation at
88 ×g for 10 min at 4 °c, and then stored at − 80 °c until
analysis. for immunohistochemical analysis, the lymph nodes
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution (wako pure
chemical, osaka, japan) at 4 °c overnight, dehydrated, and
then paraffin-embedded. cross sections (2 mum in thickness) of
paraffin-embedded tissues were mounted on silane-coated glass
slides.
2.2. western blotting analysis
western blotting analysis for cox-2 and  xxxg1876xxx  was
performed by the method described previously with slight
modification (harada et al., 1996). in brief, the frozen cells
collected from parathymic and axillary lymph nodes were
thawed and suspended in 20 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.4)
containing 0.5% tween 20 and 2 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl
fluoride (wako pure chemical) and then sonicated for 1 min at
4 °c. the homogenate was then centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for
30 min at 4 °c. the resulting supernatant was diluted with a
sampling buffer consisting of 62.5 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph
6.5), 5% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 1% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  and 2%  xxxd26xxx  and then boiled for
3 min at 95 °c. the solubilized protein (20 mug protein/lane) was

212

m. nakano et al. / european journal of pharmacology 559 (2007) 210–218

subjected to sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and then transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (millipore, bedford, ma, usa). after
blocking with i-block® (tropix, bedford, ma, usa), the
membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-mouse cox-2
antiserum (0.5 mug/ml, cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi,
usa) or rabbit anti-human  xxxg1876xxx  antibody (10 mug/ml,
cayman chemical). then, after incubation with goat antirabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (organon teknika n.v. cappel products, durham, nc,
usa), the immunoreactive proteins were detected with the
enhanced chemi-luminescent reagent (amersham pharmacia
biotech, buckinghamshire, uk) and then photographed with a
charged-coupled device camera (las-1000, fuji film, tokyo,
japan). the luminescence intensity of each band was processed
with imagegauge® software (fuji film), and the expression
levels of cox-2 were semi-quantified by a comparison of the
luminescence intensity of samples and standard cox-2 protein
(100 ng, cayman chemical).
2.3. immunohistochemical analysis
the paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated,
and then incubated with 3% h2o2 for 10 min. the preparations
were incubated with 0.5% casein for 10 min to block nonspecific binding of igg and then incubated overnight at room
temperature with rabbit anti-mouse cox-2 antibody (0.5 mug/
ml, cayman chemical), rabbit anti-human  xxxg1876xxx  antibody
(1 mug/ml, cayman chemical), rabbit anti-human thromboxane
synthase ( xxxg2254xxx ) antibody (0.5 mug/ml, cayman chemical), rabbit
anti-human prostaglandin i synthase ( xxxg1880xxx ) antibody (1 mug/ml,
cayman chemical), or non-immunised normal rabbit igg
fraction (1 mug/ml, cappel lab., west chester, pa, usa). after
being washed with pbs, the preparations were incubated for a
further 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-labelled goat antirabbit igg antibody (histofine simplestain max-po®,
nichirei, tokyo, japan). after washing, the substrate diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (stable dab™, research genetics, huntsville, al, usa) was placed on the preparation for
5 min at room temperature. hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. this resulted in brown-colored staining in immunepositive cells.
2.4. reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
analysis
total rna of parathymic lymph nodes stored in rna later™
was extracted in isogen (nippon gene, toyama, japan), a mixture
of guanidinium isothiocyanate and phenol (chomczynski and
sacchi, 1987). rna was further purified by dnase-i (takara bio
inc., ohtsu, japan) in the presence of an rnase inhibitor (takara
bio inc.). the yield of rna extracted was determined
spectrophotometrically.
a first-strand cdna synthesis kit (life science inc., st.
petersburg, fl, usa) was used for synthesis of first-strand
complementary dna (cdna) according to the protocol provided
by the manufacturer. in brief, purified total rna (4 mug) was

incubated with 50 ng of random hexamer oligonucleosides at
70 °c for 10 min and then reacted with 25 units of avian
myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. the resulting cdna
(80 ng total rna equivalent) was amplified in a final volume of
25 mul containing 10 mumol of each primer (final 0.4 mum) and 0.625
units of taq polymerase (takara bio inc.). the primers used were

elmer, norwalk, ct, usa) by initial denaturation at 94 °c for
5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °c for 30 s), annealing (60 °c
for 30 s) and extension (72 °c for 1 min or 7 min for the last cycle).
amplification products were subjected to electrophoresis on 3%
agarose and stained with ethidium bromide.
2.5. drugs
conventional cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors, aspirin (100 mg/kg)
and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) were purchased from sigma (st.
louis, mo, usa). a selective cox-1 inhibitor (warner and
mitchell, 2004), ketorolac (1 mg/kg), was also purchased from
sigma. selective cox-2 inhibitors, ns-398 (3 mg/kg, taisho
pharmaceutical co., ltd., tokyo, japan) and  xxxd2727xxx  (3 mg/kg,
helsinn sa, chiasso, switzerland), were generous gifts (futaki
et al., 1994; taniguchi et al., 1995). all drugs were suspended in
1% carboxymethyl cellulose and administered orally. drugs

3.1. cox-2 expression in the draining lymph node
cox-2 mrna was detectable in parathymic lymph nodes by
rt-pcr (fig. 1, panel a). its level was slightly over the
detection limit in lymph nodes obtained from normal control
rats, and then it increased after induction of pleurisy until 48 h.
cox-2 protein was also detectable by western blotting analysis

expressing cells. furthermore, they were distributed in the marginal zone during the early phase of inflammation and then spread
through the medulla.
3.3. effects of cox inhibitors on the volume of pleural exudate

fig. 6. effects of cox inhibitors on the level of cox-2 protein in parathymic
lymph nodes at 24 h after induction of pleurisy. the cox-2 level was expressed
by relative luminescence intensity as 100 a.u. for that of standard cox-2
protein (100 ng). the detection limit was approximately 10 a.u. each value is
the mean ± s.e.m. of 4–10 rats.

intrapleural injection of carrageenin-induced accumulation of
pleural exudate. the volume of exudate was 5.27 ± 0.49 ml
(n = 7) at 24 h after injection of carrageenin in the group not
treated with a drug (fig. 5). the exudate volumes were
significantly decreased in aspirin-, indomethacin- and ketorolac-treated groups: 3.43 ± 0.50 ml (n = 7), 3.24 ± 0.20 ml (n = 5)
and 3.49 ± 0.57 ml (n = 7), respectively. in contrast, the exudate
volumes were not affected by treatment with  xxxd2727xxx  or ns398: 4.64 ± 0.44 ml (n = 6) and 4.13 ± 0.23 ml (n = 6),

in parathymic lymph nodes (fig. 1, panel b). while the level
was below the detection limit in lymph nodes obtained from
normal control rats, it increased gradually after injection of
carrageenin and reached a peak at 48 h (fig. 1, panel c). in
contrast, cox-2 protein was below the detection limit in
axillary lymph nodes throughout the course of pleurisy
examined (data not shown). therefore, cox-2 mrna and
protein were detectable in adjacent draining lymph nodes with
similar time courses during the progression of acute
inflammation.
3.2. detection of terminal pg synthases
messenger rnas for tx synthase ( xxxg2254xxx ), pgi synthase
( xxxg1880xxx ) and microsomal pge synthase ( xxxg1876xxx )-1 were
analysed with rt-pcr (fig. 2). a high level of  xxxg2254xxx  mrna
was detected in parathymic lymph nodes of normal control rats.
its level remained almost constant even after carrageenin
injection (fig. 2, top panel). the level of  xxxg1880xxx  mrna was
below the detection limit in normal control rats. its level
gradually increased after induction of pleurisy and peaked at
48 h (fig. 2, middle panel). a low level of  xxxg1876xxx  mrna
was detectable in parathymic lymph nodes from normal control
rats. its level was gradually increased by induction of pleurisy
and peaked at 48 h (fig. 2, bottom panel).
 xxxg2254xxx  protein was detected in parathymic lymph nodes from
normal control rats (fig. 3, upper panels). cells expressing  xxxg2254xxx 
were round-shaped and distributed almost uniformly in lymph
nodes. their shape and distribution were not changed after
induction of pleurisy. while  xxxg1880xxx  protein was not detectable in
normal control lymph nodes, it was detectable in lymph nodes
from pleurisy-affected rats. immune-positive cells were located
in small vessels, suggesting that they may be vascular
endothelial cells (fig. 3, lower panel).
while a small number of cells immune-positive to antimpges-1 antibody were observed in normal control lymph
nodes, the number of the cells increased after induction of pleurisy
(fig. 4). cells expressing  xxxg1876xxx  possessed dendritic processes, a morphological characteristic similar to that of cox-2

3.4. effects of cox inhibitors on cox-2 expression
the cox-2 level was 47.92 ± 8.51 a.u. (n = 10) at 24 h after
carrageenin injection in rats not treated with a drug (fig. 6).
aspirin (100 mg/kg, once) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg, twice),
which are conventional cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors, did not
significantly affect the cox-2 level: 54.48 ± 18.19 a.u. (n = 8)
and 66.83 ± 14.77 a.u. (n = 6), respectively.  xxxd2727xxx  (3 mg/
kg, twice) and ns-398 (3 mg/kg, twice), both of which are
selective for cox-2, significantly increased the cox-2 level:
135.25 ± 33.35 a.u. (n = 4) and 125.88 ± 32.53 a.u. (n = 6),
respectively. pre-treatment with ketorolac (1 mg/kg, twice), a
selective inhibitor of cox-1, did not affect the cox-2 level:
58.54 ± 12.56 a.u. (n = 10). however, the effect of ns-398 was
partially antagonised by simultaneous administration of ketorolac: 90.21 ± 10.08 a.u. (n = 8).
effects of cox inhibitors on cox-2 expression were also
studied using immunohistochemistry (fig. 7). compared with
expression of cox-2 in the group not treated with a drug, pretreatment with ketorolac did not significantly affect cox-2
expression. in contrast, treatment with ns-398 caused a
remarkable increase in the number of cox-2-expressing cells
and in degree of extension of their dendritic processes.
moreover, the effect of ns-398 was antagonised by simultaneous administration of ketorolac, as observed with western
blotting analysis (fig. 6).
3.5. effects of cox inhibitors on expression of  xxxg1876xxx 
effects of cox inhibitors on expression of  xxxg1876xxx 
protein were examined by immunohistochemical staining
(fig. 8, panel a). although treatment with ketorolac had no
appreciable effect, treatment with ns-398 resulted in an
obvious increase in the number of  xxxg1876xxx -expressing cells
and acceleration of extension of their dendritic processes.
furthermore, the effects of ns-398 were antagonised by coadministration of ketorolac. similar results were also obtained
by western blotting analysis (fig. 8, panel b).

respectively. furthermore, co-administration of ns-398 partially relieved the significant decrease in exudate volume induced
by ketorolac: 4.11 ± 0.53 ml (n = 5). the total leukocyte count in
the pleural exudate was 416.7 ± 20.6 × 106 (n = 10) at 24 h. the
count was not significantly affected by the treatment with those
inhibitors (data not shown).

4.1. cox-2 expression in draining lymph nodes
cox-2 mrna and protein were detected by rt-pcr and
western blotting analysis, respectively, in parathymic lymph nodes
after intrapleural injection of carrageenin. these results are
consistent with results of our previous immunohistochemical
analysis (fujisawa et al., 2005). intriguingly, the time course of the
cox-2 level in the lymph nodes is quite different from that in the
leukocytes of pleural exudate (harada et al., 1996). in the exudate
leukocytes, cox-2 is detectable from 1 h after the carrageenin
injection. its level rises sharply, remains high from 3 to 7 h after the
carrageenin injection, and subsides thereafter to near the detection
limit. in contrast, a constant level of cox-1 is detectable in the
exudate cells throughout the course of pleurisy. these results
suggest that different mediator(s) may be involved in stimulation
for cox-2 expression in the exudate leukocytes and lymph nodes.

cox-2-expressing cells first appeared in the subcapsular sinus
and cortical region and then intruded into the lymphatic sinus with
time (fujisawa et al., 2005). these facts suggest that cox-2expressing cells may transmigrate from peripheral tissues into
draining lymph nodes after induction of inflammation. cox-2 was
detectable in cells having dendritic processes. in preliminary
experiments, cells with dendritic processes, morphologically
similar to cox-2-expressing cells, reacted with the ed1
monoclonal antibody (data not shown). the ed1 antigen is the
most widely used marker for rat monocytes, macrophages and
dendritic cells (van den berg et al., 2001). the majority of hepatic
and pulmonary cells that become cox-2-positive are identified as
macrophages in lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation (steiner
et al., 2006). moreover, bowman and bost (2004) reported cox-2
expression in mouse mesenteric lymph nodes after oral infection of
salmonella. they also demonstrated that macrophages and
dendritic cells have the ability to express cox-2 in response to
the bacteria in vitro. thus, cox-2 expression in draining lymph
nodes seems to be general after insult invasion, and some of the
cox-2-expressing cells in the present study may be dendritic cells.
the up-regulation of cox-2 expression is short-lived, suggesting
involvement of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors,
which are considered negative regulators of the inflammatory
response (ricote et al., 1998).
effects of cox inhibitors, having different isoform selectivity,
on cox-2 expression were examined. aspirin, indomethacin and
ketorolac, all of which have cox-1 inhibiting activity, did not
affect cox-2 expression. the dose of aspirin and indomethacin is
sufficient for exerting anti-inflammatory effects (flower et al.,
1972). in fact, these drugs significantly reduced the volume of
pleural exudate. in contrast,  xxxd2727xxx  and ns-398 significantly
enhanced the level of cox-2 expression. furthermore, ns-398
increased the number of cox-2-expressing cells and enhanced
extension of their dendritic processes, and these effects of the
cox-2 inhibitor were partially antagonised by simultaneous
treatment with ketorolac. these results suggest that cox-2expressing cells may negatively self-regulate their migration,
cox-2 expression and extension of dendritic processes by the
cox-2 product. moreover, cox-1 product(s), which may be
produced in the inflammatory locus or the draining lymph nodes,
seemed to interact with the cox-2 product, suggesting
substantial contribution of cox-1-derived prostanoids.
4.2. possible prostanoid arising via cox-2
among terminal pg synthases tested,  xxxg1876xxx  was
detected in cells showing morphological characteristics similar
to those of cox-2-expressing cells, and its expression
responded to cox inhibitors, as did that of cox-2, suggesting
cox-2-expressing cells simultaneously express  xxxg1876xxx . the
enzyme is one of microsomal pge synthases and is inducible
upon stimuli. it is functionally associated with cox-2 in several
types of cells (murakami et al., 2000). these characteristics of
 xxxg1876xxx  are consistent with the present results. many cells
produce pge2 in the immune and inflammatory systems,
including neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (harris
et al., 2002; gualde and harizi, 2004). it is well known that

pge2 is involved in causing the cardinal signs of acute inflammation: redness, swelling, fever and pain. pge2 also has diverse
effects on the regulation and activity of t cells, b cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. pge2 has opposite effects on
dendritic cell activation, depending on the site of encounter and
their maturation stage. in peripheral tissues, pge2 appears to
have stimulatory effects on immature dendritic cells (luft et al.,
2002; scandella et al., 2002). in lymphoid organs, however,
pge2 assumes an inhibitory role, reducing the activation of
dendritic cells (harizi et al., 2001), apparently being consistent
with the present results. four subtypes of pge receptors,
designated e prostanoid receptors (eprs), ep1-4r, have been
identified and have been shown to differ in their signal
transduction pathways (coleman et al., 1994; negishi et al.,
1995; ichikawa et al., 1996). all eprs were coexpressed in
dendritic cells (harizi et al., 2003). it is reported that both
stimulatory and inhibitory actions of pge2 on dendritic cells are
mediated via ep2r and  xxxg1875xxx  (scandella et al., 2002; harizi
et al., 2003). the function of ep1r and ep3r in dendritic cells
is unknown. it is speculated that these receptors may be required
for counteracting a pge2-induced effect mediated by ep2r and
 xxxg1875xxx  and may represent a possible mean by which expression
of ep2r and  xxxg1875xxx  returns to basal levels (harizi et al., 2003).
there may be differences in the expression pattern of eprs
between dendritic cells in peripheral tissues and in lymphoid
organs. moreover, monocytes and dendritic cells have the
ability to respond to prostanoids other than pge2 (gualde and
harizi, 2004; gosset et al., 2005). these possible mechanisms
may relate with our results that the dual cox inhibition by
aspirin or indomethacin and the selective cox-1 inhibition by
ketorolac did not significantly affect the levels of cox-2 and
 xxxg1876xxx  below their control levels. the following mechanism
may explain the present results: cox-1 product(s), produced in
the inflammatory locus or the draining lymph nodes, may upregulate the basic mechanism that stimulates cox-2 expressing
cells. in addition, the cox-2 product may antagonize against
the action of cox-1 product(s), but not against the basic
mechanism.
in the present study, we did not check pgd synthase and pgf
synthase.  xxxg1073xxx  is produced by a variety of cells, including mast
cells, t cells, platelets and macrophages (harris et al., 2002).
however, at least in human myeloid dendritic cells, activation
with lipopolysaccharides rapidly induces cox-2 expression,
together with the synthesis of pge2 but not  xxxg1073xxx  (fogel-petrovic
et al., 2004). two stereoisomers of pgf2 have been identified in
vivo: pgf2alpha and 9alpha-, 11beta-pgf2. the former is synthesized via
two pathways from pgh2 or pge2 by pgh 9-, 11-endoperoxide
reductase or pge 9-ketoreductase, respectively, and the latter is
synthesized from  xxxg1073xxx  by pgd 11-ketoreductase. expression of
these enzymes in immune and inflammatory cells is not yet
known (watanabe, 2002).
4.3. effects of cox inhibitors on volume of pleural exudate
drugs having cox-1-inhibiting activity significantly decreased the volume of pleural exudate at 24 h after induction of
inflammation. accumulation of inflammatory exudate is induced

m. nakano et al. / european journal of pharmacology 559 (2007) 210–218

by plasma extravasation from the gap formed between venular
endothelial cells by the action of mediators, such as bradykinin
and histamine. prostanoids, particularly pge2, dilate arterioles
and increase blood flow in the inflammatory site, thus enhancing
plasma extravasation. in rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy, plasma
exudation occurs most intensively in the early phase, 3 to 5 h after
carrageenin injection. bradykinin and pge2 produced via cox-2
expressed in infiltrating leukocytes are involved in plasma
exudation in the early phase of this model (majima et al., 1993;
harada et al., 1996). at 24 h, the rate of plasma exudation is very
low with a low level of these mediators, suggesting involvement
of the neutrophil-induced plasma extravasation (wedmore and
williams, 1981). gilroy et al. (1999) reported that drugs, having
an inhibitory activity against cox-2, significantly increased the
exudate volume at 48 h in rat carrageenin pleurisy. they
suggested the involvement of cox-2-derived cyclopentenone
pgs in various anti-inflammatory events through activating the
nuclear receptor  xxxg1807xxx 
(ricote et al., 1998). thus, in the late phase of this model, the
exudate volume may be differentially regulated by both cox-1and cox-2-derived prostanoids, and cox-1 inhibition may be
beneficial for relieving oedema. furthermore, this result suggests
that substantial amount of cox-1 product(s) may be produced for
modulating cox-2 expression in the draining lymph node in the
late phase of acute inflammation.
in conclusion, the present results suggest negative selfregulation for cox-2-expressing cells themselves by production of pge2 via  xxxg1876xxx , their migration into the draining
lymph nodes and their differentiation. moreover, cox-1- and
cox-2-derived prostanoids may play differential or sometimes
antagonistic roles in the late phase of acute inflammation.
although the precise mechanisms of the present results are still
obscure, more detailed pharmacological profiling of cox
inhibitors may be required for their rational clinical application.
