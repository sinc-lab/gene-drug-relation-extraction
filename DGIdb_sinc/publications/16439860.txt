role of anastrozole across the breast
cancer continuum: from advanced to
early disease and prevention

abstract
breast tumorigenesis is a continuum from preinvasive
lesions to early breast cancer and advanced disease. in
this article the data supporting the use of the aromatase
inhibitor anastrozole in postmenopausal women across
this continuum are reviewed. in advanced disease, anastrozole has a significant survival benefit and tolerability advantage compared with  xxxd2557xxx  when
used as second-line treatment. as first-line therapy, anastrozole significantly prolongs time to progression
compared with tamoxifen in women with  xxxg1603xxx -positive (hr+) disease. in the adjuvant setting,
anastrozole has superior efficacy and tolerability compared with tamoxifen in newly diagnosed patients and
those who have already received 2–3 years’ prior adjuvant tamoxifen. therefore, anastrozole should be considered a preferred treatment option for postmenopausal women with hr+ early breast cancer. furthermore,
anastrozole has preoperative efficacy in hr+ large or locally advanced tumors. finally, anastrozole substantially
reduces the incidence of contralateral breast cancer
compared with tamoxifen in women with hr+ early
breast cancer and, therefore, is a potential chemopreventive agent. anastrozole is thus positioned to become
the standard care for postmenopausal women with hr+

introduction

breast cancer is the most common cancer in women:
in the usa alone, it is estimated that there will be 211,240
new cases of invasive breast cancer and 58,490 of carcinoma in situ of the breast in 2005 [1]. the initiating steps
and precise pathways of breast tumorigenesis remain
poorly deﬁned, but there is a clear breast cancer continuum in which a series of molecular, cellular and pathological processes occur in the transformation of healthy
tissue to preinvasive lesions, such as ductal carcinoma in
situ, to early breast cancer and ﬁnally to advanced disease
(ﬁg. 1).
estrogen is a major factor in the development and progression of breast cancer. lifetime cumulative exposure
to estrogen and elevated levels of plasma estrogen are correlated with the risk of developing breast cancer [2] and
the  xxxg730xxx  (er) is increasingly expressed as
normal epithelium progresses to hyperplasia, hyperplasia
with atypia and ﬁnally ductal carcinoma in situ [3]. therefore, antagonizing estrogen is a logical approach to the
treatment and prevention of breast cancer. the selective

zole was ﬁrst established as a treatment of choice, moving
on to the adjuvant setting, then to more recent data on
the use of anastrozole as preoperative therapy, and, ﬁnally, its potential role in the chemoprevention of breast
cancer (ﬁg. 1).

advanced breast cancer

second-line endocrine treatment
the potential for anastrozole as a new endocrine treatment option for breast cancer was ﬁrst demonstrated in
the mid 1990s by two large randomized trials in the second-line setting after failure of tamoxifen, i.e. in patients
whose disease recurred during or within 12 months of
completing adjuvant treatment, or for patients who had
a progression of advanced disease. these trials showed
that anastrozole had both a signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt
and a signiﬁcant tolerability advantage in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had progressed after prior tamoxifen therapy compared with the
standard second-line therapy at that time,  xxxd2557xxx  [7, 8]. the ﬁrst of these trials, including 378 women,
was conducted in north america [7] and the second trial,

er modulator, tamoxifen, has been the mainstay of endocrine treatment for  xxxg1603xxx -positive (hr+)
breast cancer for many years. however, tamoxifen is associated with harmful and potentially life-threatening
side effects due to its partial estrogen agonist activity;
these side effects include an increased incidence of endometrial cancer [4, 5] and thromboembolic events [6]. furthermore, many advanced er+ tumors fail to respond to
tamoxifen, and those that do respond ultimately acquire
tamoxifen resistance and the disease recurs.
the more recently developed aromatase inhibitors
(ais) offer an alternative means of preventing the action
of estrogen and its metabolites on the breast. the ais
block the enzyme aromatase, which is responsible for the
conversion of androgens to estrogens via a pathway that
is the main source of estrogen for postmenopausal women, thereby suppressing estrogen levels. three third-generation ais are available: the nonsteroidal ais anastrozole and letrozole, and the steroidal ai exemestane; of
these three, anastrozole is the most advanced in terms of
clinical development.
in this article, the data supporting the use of anastrozole across the breast cancer continuum are reviewed,
starting with advanced breast cancer, in which anastro-

data from the survival analysis at a median follow-up of 43.7 months [11].

including 386 women, was conducted in europe, south
africa and australia [8]. in each of these trials the women were randomized double-blind to anastrozole 1 mg or
anastrozole 10 mg, or open-label to  xxxd2557xxx . a
prospectively planned combined analysis at a median follow-up of 31 months demonstrated that anastrozole 1 mg
once daily was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant
survival advantage compared with  xxxd2557xxx 
[hazard ratio 0.78; 97.5% conﬁdence intervals (ci) 0.60,
1.0; p ! 0.025] (table 1, ﬁg. 2) [9]. the higher dose of anastrozole did not result in additional clinical beneﬁt and
the 1-mg dose was subsequently approved for routine
clinical practice. anastrozole was also better tolerated
than  xxxd2557xxx : dyspnea, hypertension, vaginal
hemorrhage, weight gain, sweating and increased appetite
were all at least half as common with anastrozole 1 mg
than with  xxxd2557xxx  [9]. for those patients treated
with anastrozole, body weight remained at or around the
baseline value for up to 9 months of treatment with both
doses, whereas those patients treated with  xxxd2557xxx  continued to gain weight at 9 months. only diarrhea
was at least twice as common with anastrozole 1 mg. the
results from these trials established anastrozole as a second-line treatment of choice for advanced breast cancer
in postmenopausal women, which is reﬂected by its approval for this indication in over 90 countries. moreover,
the ﬁrst observation of a survival advantage, in favor of
anastrozole, from a comparison of two hormone therapies in patients failing tamoxifen in advanced disease,
prompted several randomized trials challenging the ‘gold

standard’ tamoxifen in ﬁrst-line treatment for advanced
disease as well as in the adjuvant setting.

first-line endocrine treatment
the results of two pivotal large randomized trials have
subsequently shown that anastrozole signiﬁcantly prolongs time to progression compared with tamoxifen in
postmenopausal women with hr+ advanced breast cancer when used in the ﬁrst-line setting, i.e. in newly diagnosed patients or those who have not received endocrine
therapy within the previous 12 months [10, 11]. the ﬁrst
of these trials, the north american trial [11], included
353 women and was conducted in the usa and canada,
and the second trial, the tamoxifen or arimidex randomized group efﬁcacy and tolerability (target) trial [10], included 668 women and was conducted in europe, australia, new zealand, south america and south
africa. in a prospectively planned combined analysis at
a median follow-up of 18 months, median time to progression in women with hr+ tumors was 10.7 months
with anastrozole compared with 6.4 months with tamoxifen (p = 0.022) (table 1, ﬁg. 3) [12]. anastrozole was also
associated with tolerability beneﬁts, with signiﬁcantly
fewer thromboembolic events in patients randomized to
anastrozole (3.6 vs. 6.5%, p = 0.0434) and a lower incidence of vaginal bleeding (1.0 vs. 2.2%) than in those patients randomized to tamoxifen. a further combined
analysis at a median follow-up of 44 months also showed
that anastrozole was at least as effective as tamoxifen for
overall survival (table 1) [13].

treatment of anastrozole-resistant disease
within the context of anastrozole replacing tamoxifen
as standard of care we need to consider the possible treatments if recurrence occurs after anastrozole treatment.
current options include tamoxifen, exemestane, or  xxxd2165xxx , the ﬁrst of a new type of antiestrogen, an er
antagonist that downregulates the er and is devoid of
agonist effects. a retrospective analysis assessed this issue
in the north american and target trials, in which patients were randomized to anastrozole or tamoxifen as
ﬁrst-line treatment and then treated, at the time of progression, either with anastrozole or tamoxifen as secondline therapy on an open-label basis. results indicated that
treatment with anastrozole ﬁrst does not result in the development of resistance to tamoxifen [15]. a further substudy of the target trial, the swiss group for clinical
cancer research (sakk) crossover trial, investigated responses in patients who received double-blind crossover
treatment. whilst there were no statistically signiﬁcant
differences, all of the efﬁcacy outcomes, including survival, were in favor of the anastrozole-tamoxifen sequence over tamoxifen-anastrozole [16]. two phase ii
trials have also shown that  xxxd2165xxx  has potential as an
alternative treatment option for postmenopausal women
with advanced breast cancer who progress after treatment
with tamoxifen and ais [17, 18], and two ongoing stud-

early breast cancer

primary adjuvant therapy
early detection has increased the proportion of women
with breast cancer who present with early stage disease;
during 1995–2000, 64% of cases in the usa were localized [19]. although surgery removes the detectable cancer
in these women, recurrence – generally as a result of undetected micrometastases – remains a primary concern.
as the risk of recurrence is highest in the ﬁrst 5 years after
a diagnosis of breast cancer, with a peak within 2 years
of diagnosis [4], it is important that women receive the
most effective adjuvant therapy at the ﬁrst opportunity
in order to minimize this risk. in 1989, fisher et al. [4,
20] demonstrated that adjuvant tamoxifen signiﬁcantly
reduced the risk of recurrence in women with er+ early
breast cancer compared with no adjuvant treatment (placebo). more recently, the arimidex, tamoxifen, alone or
in combination (atac) trial has shown that anastrozole
has superior efﬁcacy and a number of important tolerability beneﬁts compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal
women with early breast cancer [21–23].
in the atac study (n = 9,366), at a median follow-up
of 33 months, anastrozole signiﬁcantly prolonged diseasefree survival, improved time to recurrence and reduced
the incidence of contralateral breast cancer compared
with tamoxifen [21] (table 2). these beneﬁts remained
consistently in favor of anastrozole at an updated analysis
at a median follow-up of 47 months (table 2) [22]. mature
data from the atac completed treatment analysis at
a median follow-up of 68 months now conﬁrm that 5
years of primary adjuvant therapy with anastrozole signiﬁcantly prolongs disease-free survival, time to recurrence, and time to distant recurrence, and signiﬁcantly
reduces the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer
compared with tamoxifen. these beneﬁts with anastrozole were further improved in the hr+ population (84%
of the overall population), as might be expected in the
clinically relevant target population for adjuvant endocrine treatment (table 2) [23]. in those patients with hr+
tumors, 5 years of adjuvant therapy with anastrozole
rather than tamoxifen reduced the risk of recurrence, the
most clinically relevant efﬁcacy endpoint, by a further

in a third independent trial, conducted in spain, anastrozole was associated with a signiﬁcantly longer median survival compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women (n = 238) with er+ advanced breast cancer
(17.4 vs. 16.0 months; hazard ratio 0.64; 95% ci 0.47,
0.86; p = 0.003) [14]. this trial differed from the north
american and target trials in that the participants
had received no prior adjuvant therapy and the majority
received only best supportive care on progression, whereas in the other trials, prior adjuvant therapy was permissible and those patients still considered suitable for hormonal therapy after ﬁrst progression moved on to alternative therapies. although the design of the spanish trial
may not be representative of standard clinical practice in
many centers, it is more likely to reveal a true survival
beneﬁt for one agent over another as the effects of the
comparative agents are not confounded by previous or
subsequent therapies.
thus, anastrozole has clear efﬁcacy and tolerability
advantages compared with tamoxifen as ﬁrst-line therapy
of hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer, which is
reﬂected by its approval in over 80 countries for this indication.

the completion of therapy (ﬁg. 4). consistent with previous adjuvant tamoxifen studies that have demonstrated
that signiﬁcant beneﬁts in time to recurrence reliably
translate into beneﬁts for time to distant recurrence and
breast cancer mortality [4], there was a 16% reduction in

26% over and above that seen with tamoxifen, and reduced the risk of contralateral breast cancer by a further
53%. the absolute beneﬁt for anastrozole in terms of time
to recurrence begins within 1 year of starting treatment
and continues to increase over time, extending beyond

risk of distant recurrence and a 13% reduction in breast
cancer mortality in patients with hr+ tumors. these differences can be expected to become statistically signiﬁcant
with time as more events occur. this trial population had
a relatively good prognosis and in a previous study it took
over 7 years to show a signiﬁcant survival advantage for
tamoxifen compared with placebo for women with er+
breast cancer [24, 25].
with respect to tolerability, anastrozole was consistently associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced incidence of
hot ﬂushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, endometrial malignancies, ischemic cerebrovascular events, and
venous thromboembolic events compared with tamoxifen at a median follow-up of 33 months, in an updated
safety analysis 7 months later and in the atac completed treatment analysis at a median follow-up of 68
months [21–23]. since almost all patients have completed their scheduled 5 years of therapy, the safety and tolerability data collected during treatment are now considered ﬁnal. although anastrozole was associated with a
signiﬁcantly increased incidence of joint symptoms and
fractures compared with tamoxifen, the fracture rate with
anastrozole stabilized after 2 years of therapy and the
relative risk of fracture remained constant with longer
duration of therapy and ﬁnally returned to the lower rate
observed with tamoxifen at completion of therapy [23,
26, 27]. the incidence of hip fracture, a fracture type associated with high morbidity and mortality, was similar
for anastrozole and tamoxifen. compared with tamoxifen, patients who were treated with anastrozole experienced signiﬁcantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse
events (11.1 vs. 14.3%; p = 0.0002) and drug-related serious adverse events (4.7 vs. 9.0%; p ! 0.0001).
the atac completed treatment analysis, based on
mature reliable data, reinforces that anastrozole is signiﬁcantly more effective and better tolerated than tamoxifen,
and that 5 years of anastrozole should now be considered
as the preferred initial adjuvant endocrine treatment for
postmenopausal women with hr+ early breast cancer.
this is endorsed by the current american society of clinical oncology technology assessment, which recommends that adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women
with hr+ breast cancer should include an ai, and the
particular ai chosen should be the one with the most data
in the relevant clinical setting [28]. anastrozole is the only
ai with published data as initial adjuvant therapy for
postmenopausal women with hr+ early breast cancer
and the only ai with mature long-term data for which a
full risk:beneﬁt proﬁle has been established. anastrozole
is now approved in over 60 countries for this indication.

treatment following adjuvant tamoxifen
the higher risk of recurrence of breast cancer within
the ﬁrst 3 years of diagnosis [29] and the increased incidence of adverse events and withdrawals from treatment
associated with tamoxifen relative to anastrozole within
this time period [21] indicate that patients may gain the
most beneﬁt from starting primary adjuvant treatment
with anastrozole rather than tamoxifen. however, for
those patients already receiving adjuvant tamoxifen,
switching treatment to an ai may improve their outcome.
the arimidex-nolvadex (arno) 95 and austrian breast
and colorectal cancer study group (abcsg) 8 trials
have been conducted to assess whether switching to anastrozole after 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen is more effective than continuing tamoxifen treatment for the remaining 3 years of adjuvant therapy. a prospectively
planned, event-driven combined preliminary analysis of
these two trials (n = 3,123) at a median follow-up of 26
months showed that anastrozole signiﬁcantly prolonged
event-free survival compared with tamoxifen (hazard ratio 0.59; 95% ci 0.42, 0.82; p ! 0.0018) [30].
these results conﬁrm those of the earlier italian anastrozole tamoxifen (ita) trial in which patients who had
received 2–3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (n = 448) were
randomized to tamoxifen or anastrozole for the remainder of their 5 years of adjuvant treatment [31]. this study
also found a signiﬁcant beneﬁt for anastrozole over
tamoxifen in terms of event-free survival (hazard ratio
0.38; 95% ci 0.20, 0.63; p = 0.0002) after a median follow-up of 36 months.
although there are no data from prospective sequencing studies to conﬁrm whether it is better to start with
anastrozole or to switch to anastrozole after initial tamoxifen treatment, these data indicate that postmenopausal
women who are already receiving tamoxifen as adjuvant
therapy should be switched to anastrozole after 2–3 years
of treatment. the results of a further ongoing trial,
abcsg 6a, should also soon reveal whether 3 years of
anastrozole is beneﬁcial for postmenopausal women with
early breast cancer who have already received 5 years of
adjuvant tamoxifen with or without  xxxd147xxx 
compared with placebo.

prevention

adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen was shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence: in
the early breast cancer trialists’ collaborative group
(ebctcg) overview, 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduced the risk of recurrence by approximately 42% in
women with er+ or er-unknown tumors, and by 50%
in women with er+ tumors compared with no adjuvant
tamoxifen [4]. such ﬁndings suggested that tamoxifen
might play a role in breast cancer prevention, and a metaanalysis of subsequent studies, including the national
surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project p-i (nsabp
p-i) study [38] and the international breast cancer intervention study (ibis i) [39], found that prophylactic
tamoxifen reduced the incidence of breast cancer by 38%
in women at an increased risk of breast cancer compared
with placebo, and reduced the incidence of er+ tumors
by 48% [40]. tamoxifen has since been approved in the
usa for the short-term reduction of breast cancer incidence in women at high risk of breast cancer; however,
its serious but rare adverse effects, such as thromboembolism and endometrial cancer, are a concern and the
overall risk:beneﬁt ratio for the use of tamoxifen in prevention is unclear.
adjuvant treatment with anastrozole for 5 years has
been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer by 53% over and above that already seen with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women
with hr+ early breast cancer (table 2) [23] and, therefore,
might prevent 70–80% of hr+ tumors in women at high
risk of breast cancer. as with tamoxifen, if anastrozole
was effective in the prevention of breast cancer, the long-

tomy. two large randomized trials, immediate preoperative arimidex, tamoxifen or combined with tamoxifen (impact) and preoperative arimidex compared
with tamoxifen (proact), compared 3 months of
neoadjuvant treatment with anastrozole and tamoxifen
in postmenopausal women with large operable or inoperable (including locally advanced) hr+ breast cancer
[32, 33].
a prospectively planned combined analysis of the
impact and proact trials showed that anastrozole,
despite a short duration of exposure of 3 months, was an
effective preoperative treatment in women (n = 535) with
operable or inoperable hr+ breast cancer, resulting in a
numerically higher objective response rate than treatment with tamoxifen (table 3) [34]. of those patients
scheduled for mastectomy or considered inoperable at
trial entry, i.e. the target population for preoperative therapy (n = 344), the objective response rate was signiﬁcantly higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen, enabling
breast-conserving surgery in signiﬁcantly more patients
treated with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen (table 3) [34]. the separate trials both reported that anastrozole was well tolerated over the short duration of therapy
[32, 33].
these data add to a growing body of evidence to support the role of anastrozole as an effective and well-tolerated preoperative therapy for postmenopausal women
with hr+ large or locally advanced breast cancer [35–
37].

discussion

the breast cancer continuum is a spectrum from preinvasive lesions originating within normal breast tissue,
with histological progression from atypical hyperplasia
to invasive breast cancer. this evolution involves distinct changes in gene and protein expression, but most
of these seem to occur during the transition from normal tissue to ductal carcinoma in situ [42]. thus, it
could be hypothesized that agents with demonstrated
effectiveness in a particular setting, such as second-line

anastrozole across the breast cancer
continuum

therapy, are likely to have wider application across the
breast cancer continuum. of the third-generation ais
anastrozole has displayed the broadest spectrum of use
across this continuum.
as second-line treatment for advanced breast cancer,
anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane have each demonstrated effectiveness as alternatives to  xxxd2557xxx ,
but a mature survival advantage compared with  xxxd2557xxx  has only been demonstrated for anastrozole
[9]. no mature survival data have been reported to date
for exemestane [43] and studies with letrozole have not
shown a statistically signiﬁcant survival advantage [44,
45]. in the ﬁrst-line setting, both anastrozole and letrozole
have been shown to improve time to progression compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with
advanced breast cancer [10, 46]. first-line data for exemestane have not been fully published and it is not approved for this indication.
to date anastrozole is the only third-generation ai
with conclusive and mature evidence demonstrating signiﬁcant efﬁcacy and tolerability advantages compared
with tamoxifen as initial endocrine therapy for early
breast cancer over the full 5-year recommended treatment period [21–23]. data from the breast international
group (big) 1-98 trial comparing letrozole with tamoxifen as initial endocrine therapy at a median follow-up of
26 months have been presented [47] but are not yet published. the other third-generation ais have been evaluated in the adjuvant setting after initial tamoxifen therapy: anastrozole and exemestane have both been evaluated
in switching trials after 2–3 years of tamoxifen therapy
[30, 31, 48] and letrozole has been evaluated in the extended adjuvant setting after 5 years of tamoxifen therapy [49]. these studies show that changing to an ai may
be appropriate for a patient who is already receiving
adjuvant tamoxifen. however, the lower rate of recurrence and the reduced incidence of contralateral breast
cancer with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen in
the ﬁrst 2 years of initial endocrine therapy [21] suggest
that further beneﬁt can be gained by initial adjuvant
therapy with anastrozole. in response to this, ongoing
trials are comparing initial ai therapy with a planned
crossover from tamoxifen to an ai after a ﬁxed time.
another question that needs to be answered is whether
endocrine therapy with an ai should be continued
beyond 5 years.
in the preoperative setting, both anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to improve the objective response
rate compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hr+ breast cancer [34, 50]. no data are available

term side effects would also need to be considered to determine its overall risk:beneﬁt ratio, particularly in women who are not suffering from breast cancer but are just
at high risk of the disease. anastrozole now has long-term
safety and tolerability data over a 5-year treatment period
and, compared with tamoxifen, the side effects of anastrozole are predictable, preventable and manageable. anastrozole is associated with signiﬁcantly fewer venous
thromboembolic events compared with tamoxifen (2.8
vs. 4.5%, p = 0.0004) but is associated with an increased
risk of fractures (11.0 vs. 7.7%, p ! 0.0001) [23]. however, the fracture rate with anastrozole stabilized after 2
years of therapy and the relative risk of fracture versus
tamoxifen remained constant with longer duration of
treatment before ﬁnally returning to the lower rate observed with tamoxifen at completion of therapy [23, 26,
27]. the appropriate use of bisphosphonates in women
with low bone mineral density may prevent the bone loss
and subsequent fractures associated with ais [28]. preliminary results from abcsg 12 have shown that the
addition of the bisphosphonate  xxxd3561xxx  prevented the bone loss that occurred in premenopausal breast
cancer patients treated with the combination of anastrozole and  xxxd2229xxx  [41].
the overall risk:beneﬁt ratio of anastrozole in the prevention of breast cancer is being investigated in the ongoing phase iii trial, ibis ii, which was launched in september 2003. the preventive study of ibis ii compares
anastrozole versus placebo in approximately 6,000 postmenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer. a
bone substudy examines the effects of anastrozole on
bone mineral density and the risks of developing osteoporosis and/or fractures among women participating in
the ibis ii study. a second arm of ibis ii compares anastrozole versus tamoxifen in approximately 4,000 postmenopausal women with locally excised er+ ductal carcinoma in situ.

in the preoperative setting for exemestane. prevention
studies are ongoing with anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane.
the availability of alternative endocrine agents to
tamoxifen as breast cancer treatment options raises the
possibility of sequential use of these agents if resistance
develops. this would prolong the time during which endocrine therapies can be used, thereby avoiding the more
acute toxicities associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
as anastrozole is replacing tamoxifen as the standard of
care as initial adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer and
in the ﬁrst- or second-line setting for advanced breast cancer, it is appropriate to consider possible treatments if
recurrence occurs after anastrozole.

the introduction of anastrozole, along with the other
third-generation ais, has moved breast cancer treatment
into a new era. anastrozole is positioned to become a
treatment of choice across the whole breast cancer continuum. it is well established for advanced breast cancer
and should now be considered the preferred initial adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hr+
early breast cancer. recent data have also shown that anastrozole is an effective preoperative treatment enabling
mastectomy in patients with previously inoperable disease and breast-conserving surgery in women previously
only eligible for mastectomy. anastrozole has also shown
promise in the preventive setting and the results of ongoing studies are awaited with interest.
