clinical pharmacology and mechanism
of action of  xxxd3564xxx 
victor biton, md
abstract
antiepileptic drugs (aeds) suppress seizures by
selectively modifying the excitability of neurons
and blocking seizure firing with minimal disturbance of nonepileptic activity. all aeds have been
shown to work by at least one of 3 main mechanisms of action: through modulation of voltagegated ion channels, enhancement of synaptic
inhibition, and inhibition of synaptic excitation.
 xxxd3564xxx  is a novel aed that has a broad
combination of complementary mechanisms of
action, which may offer a clinical advantage over
other antiepileptic agents. by altering the fast
inactivation threshold of voltage-dependent
sodium channels,  xxxd3564xxx  reduces sustained
high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials.  xxxd3564xxx  also inhibits low-threshold ttype calcium channels in neurons, which may
prevent the spread of seizure discharge across
cells. in addition,  xxxd3564xxx  is a weak inhibitor
of carbonic anhydrase. however, this mechanism
is not believed to contribute to the antiepileptic
activity of  xxxd3564xxx . although  xxxd3564xxx  also
seems to alter dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine metabolism, it is not clear to what extent
these effects on neurotransmitters are involved in
the clinical actions of the drug. in addition to
these actions, recent evidence suggests that  xxxd3564xxx  may exert neuroprotective actions, independent of its antiepileptic activity. these
potential effects may be important in preventing
neuronal damage caused by recurrent seizures.
therefore, it seems that the multiple pharmacological actions of  xxxd3564xxx  may contribute to
the seizure reductions observed in a wide range of
epilepsies and may help to preserve efficacy in
individual patients despite possible changes in
electrophysiological status.

e

pileptic syndromes are characterized by
recurrent seizures that occur as a result of
spontaneous periodic disruptions to the

normal electrical activity of the brain. seizures are caused by a variety of pathological
conditions including genetic abnormalities
and acquired injuries and a range of physiological disturbances in brain function.1 the
mechanisms by which seizures are generated
and their behavioral manifestations are a
direct consequence of the location of abnormality within the brain. therefore, a range of
seizure types and epileptic syndromes has
been described.
the aim of antiepileptic drug (aed)
therapy is to selectively modify the excitability of neurons, thereby suppressing seizure firing without disturbing nonepileptic
activity. it has been proposed that the
antiepileptic actions of most aeds could be
categorized as modulation of voltage-gated
ion channels (sodium [na+], calcium [ xxxg293xxx +],
and potassium); enhancement of synaptic
inhibition (mediated by +- xxxd2177xxx ,
type a [gabaa] receptors); and inhibition of
synaptic excitation (by blockade of glutamate receptors).2 it is possible that different
mechanisms of action may be effective in
suppressing different types of seizures, even
within a single patient.1
 xxxd3564xxx  ( xxxd3564xxx ) is a novel aed that has a
unique chemical structure and a broad
spectrum of antiepileptic activity.3 more
than 15 years of clinical experience with
 xxxd3564xxx  (2 million patient-years of exposure) have accumulated since its approval
for clinical use in japan in 1989.  xxxd3564xxx 
was approved for the adjunctive treatment
of adult partial-onset seizures in the united
states in 2000 and in europe in 2005, with
additional indications for monotherapy and
pediatrics in japan.

 xxxd3564xxx  has demonstrated benefits
in refractory partial-onset seizures as adjunctive therapy4y7 with sustained benefits over
long-term treatment.8y10 in addition to proven efficacy in patients with partial-onset
seizures, preliminary clinical data suggest
that  xxxd3564xxx  is effective as monotherapy,11y15 and in patients with primary
generalized seizures,16y18 postsurgical seizures,19 progressive myoclonic epilepsies20y22
(including unverricht-lundborg disease and
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy), 23y27 and
absence seizures.28,29 there are reports that
 xxxd3564xxx  may have therapeutic properties
beyond seizure control (eg, beneficial effects
have been seen in parkinsonian symptoms,30
chronic headache,31 and refractory bipolar
disorder.32,33 there is also some evidence
that  xxxd3564xxx  may be associated with
modest weight loss.34

this review evaluates the effects of
 xxxd3564xxx  on the different mechanisms
implicated in epileptic activity.

 xxxd3564xxx  mechanisms
of action
the beneficial effects of  xxxd3564xxx 
seen in a wide range of epilepsies are likely
to be attributable to its unique range of
complementary modes of action. these
multiple modes of action differentiate  xxxd3564xxx  from other aeds (table 1). as may be
expected, much of the data regarding the
mode of action of  xxxd3564xxx  is derived from
in vitro and animal models. however, these
data indicate that the antiepileptic effects
result primarily from ion channel modulation, but neuroprotective mechanisms and

effects on neurotransmitter systems have
also been described.

ion channel modulation
data suggest that  xxxd3564xxx  stabilizes
neuronal membranes and disrupts synchronized firing through combined effects on ion
channels, thereby limiting the spread of seizures.49y51 the effects of  xxxd3564xxx  are
concentrated on na+ and  xxxg293xxx + channels. there
are no data suggesting effects on potassium or
chloride channels, which play an important
role in regulating neuronal excitability.
inhibition of voltage-dependent
na+ channels
during epileptic discharge, the neuronal
cell body is subject to synaptic depolarization
and na+ influx, leading to high-frequency
repetitive firing. preclinical studies showed
that  xxxd3564xxx  reduces na+ currents without affecting potassium currents.49,52 by
reducing the influx of na+ into the neuron,
 xxxd3564xxx  raises the threshold for generation of action potentials. this inhibition of
na+ ion movement occurs without effects on
compensatory potassium efflux and reduces
sustained repetitive firing.  xxxd3564xxx  has no

effect on na+ channel activation but produces a shift in the steady-state fast inactivation
threshold of voltage-dependent na+ channels
(fig. 1). this effect was produced only
with intracellular  xxxd3564xxx  and not with
extracellular concentrations of the drug.52
it is proposed that the effects of  xxxd3564xxx 
of na+ currents may be caused by preferential binding to inactive na+ channels that
produces use- and voltage-dependent blockade and slows the rate of recovery of these
channels from inactivation,50 thereby limiting
epileptiform activity. this proposed mechanism is similar to that seen for some other
aeds, including phenytoin,53 carbamazepine,54 and sodium valproate.55
additional effects of na+
channel inhibition
as well as attenuating neuronal excitability,  xxxd3564xxx  may also alter the process of
synaptic transmission. glutamate is a primary
mediator of neuronal excitation during seizures.  xxxd3564xxx  has been shown to inhibit
excitatory glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission, suggesting presynaptic effects56,57
without influencing the postsynaptic effects
of glutamate in spinal cord neurons.49

zhu and rogawski56 examined whether  xxxd3564xxx  affected glutamate-mediated
synaptic excitation in a rat hippocampal
slice preparation.  xxxd3564xxx  substantially
reduced the frequency and amplitude of
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in  xxxg287xxx  pyramidal neurons, an action
that was reversible on washout.  xxxd3564xxx 
decreased the amplitude of spontaneous
excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by
high-frequency stimulation of the stratum
radiatum but had no effects on those evoked
by low-frequency stimulation. this presynaptic use-dependent inhibition of the release of
excitatory neurotransmitters seems to represent the cellular basis of  xxxd3564xxx ’s anticonvulsive effects in patients with epilepsy.
it is not clear currently whether inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release is a
direct effect or secondary to the effects of
 xxxd3564xxx  on voltage-gated na+ or  xxxg293xxx +
channels.
although a direct role for  xxxd3564xxx 
on regulating glutamate-mediated synaptic
transmission remains to be demonstrated
clearly, a recent study has shown that
 xxxd3564xxx  may up-regulate the neuronal
transporter,  xxxg2102xxx 
in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of
rats.  xxxg2102xxx  contributes to the attenuation of the effects of
glutamate by the removal of the amino acid
from the synaptic cleft.58
reduction of t-type  xxxg293xxx + currents
t-type  xxxg293xxx + channels can be activated
by small depolarizations of the plasma membrane; the resulting  xxxg293xxx + influx generates
low-threshold spikes which can trigger a
burst of action potentials mediated by na+
channels.59  xxxd3564xxx  has been shown to
inhibit low-threshold t-type  xxxg293xxx + channels in
cultured neurons of rat cerebral cortex,
leading to a reduction in  xxxg293xxx +-dependent
action potentials.60 these effects were generated at therapeutic drug concentrations
without similar blockade of high-threshold
l-type  xxxg293xxx + channels. kito and colleagues51
have demonstrated that  xxxd3564xxx  reduced

t-type  xxxg293xxx + currents (ica) in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 2). furthermore,  xxxd3564xxx 
caused a shift in the channel population
toward the inactivation state, allowing fewer
channels to open during membrane depolarization. these properties indicate that at a
cellular level,  xxxd3564xxx  may suppress an
important inward current that underlies
bursting activity of excitable cells and therefore may prevent the spread of seizure
discharge.51,60
many other aeds, including phenytoin,41  xxxd2056xxx ,44 sodium valproate,38
dimethadione,61 and topiramate,42 also have
inhibitory effects on  xxxg293xxx + channels, suggesting that this mechanism of action could
confer activity against various different seizure types.60 however,  xxxd3564xxx  differs in
that it inhibits low-threshold t-type  xxxg293xxx +
channel activity, whereas some other aeds
such as carbamazepine62 and topiramate42

inhibition shown represents nominal inhibition
minus 4.3%. the curve for t-type ica was

stoichiometry between  xxxd3564xxx  concentration and effect on t-type ica. reprinted from

are known to inhibit l-type  xxxg293xxx + channels.
this specificity for t-type  xxxg293xxx + channels may
have clinical significance because inhibition
of l-type  xxxg293xxx + channels may lead to proconvulsive effects in absence seizures.61y64

effects on neurotransmitter systems
the ability of an aed to enhance the
basal release of inhibitory neurotransmitters
and reduce neurotransmitter release at neuronal excitation will likely contribute to
antiepileptic efficacy.
although the effects of  xxxd3564xxx  on
na+ and  xxxg293xxx + channels may mediate some
effects on neurotransmitter release, there is
evidence that  xxxd3564xxx  also directly alters
the synthesis, release, and degradation of a
number of different neurotransmitters,
including glutamate, gaba, dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-ht]), and
acetylcholine, which may lead to enhancement of synaptic inhibition.
+- xxxd2177xxx 
 xxxd3564xxx  may enhance gaba function through interaction at allosteric or other
binding sites and/or by influencing gaba
transport.58,65  xxxd3564xxx  has been shown
to enhance gaba transport in the hippocampus,66 but observations in spinal cord
neurons suggested that postsynaptic responses
to gaba were unaffected by  xxxd3564xxx .49
studies in rat hippocampus and cortex demonstrate that  xxxd3564xxx  also down-regulates
the gaba transporter,  xxxg2143xxx ,58 an action
which may result in increased tissue and
synaptic concentrations of gaba.
in binding studies conducted using a
crude synaptosomal fraction of whole rat
brain,  xxxd3564xxx  was shown to bind to
saturation.65 mimaki et al67 later suggested
this binding to be through interaction with
the gaba/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore. binding produced no change in
chloride ion flux, suggesting an allosteric
interaction of  xxxd3564xxx  with a site coupled
to the benzodiazepine receptor.
however, there is no direct evidence
that  xxxd3564xxx  potentiates gabaa receptor-

related events in the same way as seen with
benzodiazepines.68 in this respect,  xxxd3564xxx  resembles  xxxd2466xxx , which has
also not demonstrated significant gabaminergic mechanisms,69 and differs from carbamazepine and phenytoin, which have been
shown to potentiate gaba-mediated chloride currents,70 and gabapentin, which has
been observed to mimic gaba-receptor
activation.71 however, 1 study has noted
that the interaction of  xxxd3564xxx  with the
gaba/benzodiazepine receptor complex
seems to be similar to that of phenytoin.72
 xxxd3564xxx  binding to an allosteric
site, or other binding site, may limit inhibition by antagonists or allosteric modulators
of gaba-gated currents. this mechanism has
been suggested from in vitro and in vivo
studies of levetiracetam73,74 and may contribute to the antiseizure effect and inhibition of kindling seen with both aeds.
overall, the effects of  xxxd3564xxx  on
gaba function are unclear, and the mechanisms by which it affects gaba transport
require further investigation.
monoamines
there is evidence that enhanced basal
monoamine levels may elevate seizure
thresholds.75  xxxd3564xxx  has been observed
to increase extracellular levels of the monoamines 5-ht and dopamine in vivo35 without
affecting basal glutamate release. this property is shared with carbamazepine, 35,76
although it has not been established how
far these neurotransmitter effects contribute
to the anticonvulsant activity of either drug.
modulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release may be mediated via effects on
soluble  xxxg1610xxx 
attachment protein receptor, a protein
involved in exocytosis of neurotransmitters
at the synapse.75,77
dopamine
the mechanism by which  xxxd3564xxx 
enhances dopaminergic function in rats may
involve increasing basal dopamine levels in
the striatum and hippocampus, as suggested

in rat studies.35,76,78,79 data suggest that
therapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  increase dopamine synthesis, leading to increased levels of
the dopamine precursor  xxxd2471xxx , dopamine, and the metabolite homovanillic acid.  xxxd3564xxx  may also inhibit
degradation of dopamine as shown by
decreased levels of the metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, consistent with weak inhibition of  xxxg1358xxx  by  xxxd3564xxx .79
serotonin
 xxxd3564xxx  seems to facilitate serotonergic transmission by increasing the overall
levels and turnover of 5-ht in the striatum
and hippocampus.35,76y78 therapeutic doses
of  xxxd3564xxx  have been shown to increase
levels of 5-ht; its precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan; and the metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.35,78,80 as with the observed
effects on dopamine levels,  xxxd3564xxx  seems
to have biphasic effects on 5-ht concentrations. supratherapeutic doses are reported to
reduce 5-ht levels in rat hippocampus.80
acetylcholine
effects of  xxxd3564xxx  have also been
reported on acetylcholine release in the
striatum and frontal cortex. studies in rats
have shown that therapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx  increase extracellular levels and turnover of acetylcholine without change in
cholinesterase activity37,81 or basal glutamate
release. this property is shared with carbamazepine,37,81 although the contribution of the
effect to antiepileptic efficacy is unclear.
 xxxd3564xxx  also decreased potassium-evoked
acetylcholine release in rat frontal cortex,
suggesting ability to reduce depolarizationrelated acetylcholine release, which could
contribute to antiepileptic action.37
consistent with data regarding other
neurotransmitters, the effect of  xxxd3564xxx  on
acetylcholine seems to be biphasic, with turnover reduced at supratherapeutic doses.37,81

neuroprotective actions
independent of its effects on ion channels and neurotransmitter systems, zonisa-

mide has potentially neuroprotective effects,
which may prevent neuronal damage caused
by recurrent seizures.82
 xxxd3564xxx  has been shown to prevent
hypoxic-ischemic damage in neonatal rats,83
adult rats,84 and adult gerbils.85 although the
reduction in neuronal damage in the gerbil
global ischemia model was related to
reduced glutamate release,85 which may be
attributable to inhibitory effect on na+
channels or to direct effects on glutamate
as previously discussed, the neuroprotection
afforded by  xxxd3564xxx  in a neonatal rat
model in vivo was suggested to be independent of its anticonvulsant efficacy.83 in addition, therapeutic doses of  xxxd3564xxx , but
not carbamazepine or valproate, protected
against damage induced by focal cerebral
ischemia in rats.84
the neuroprotective effects of  xxxd3564xxx  may be linked to its antioxidant properties.82 studies in vitro have shown that
 xxxd3564xxx  scavenges hydroxyl and nitric
oxide (no) free radicals in a dose-dependent
manner,86 and dose-dependent reductions in
lipid peroxidation have been observed after
 xxxd3564xxx  administration in a rat model.87,88
additionally,  xxxd3564xxx  inhibited no synthase, reducing no production after injury in
a rat model.89
the putative neuroprotective properties of  xxxd3564xxx  may help protect neurons
from free radical damage, assist in the
stabilization of neuronal membranes, and
minimize the initiation and propagation of
seizures. the free-radical scavenging properties of  xxxd3564xxx  may be of particular
significance in the prevention of postsurgical
epilepsy and in patients with progressive
myoclonus epilepsy.90

other actions
 xxxd3564xxx  is a weak inhibitor of
carbonic anhydrase. its action on carbonic
anhydrase is generally considered to be 100
to 200 times less potent than that of
acetazolamide.91 of the 2 carbonic anhydrase isozymes (type i [or b] and ii [or c])
present in human erythrocytes, it is carbonic

anhydrase ii that primarily mediates carbon
dioxide hydration and bicarbonate dehydration in vivo.92  xxxd3564xxx  is 188 times less
potent than acetazolamide as an inhibitor of
type ii carbonic anhydrase.91 this mechanism
does not seem to contribute to the antiepileptic action of the drug, as demonstrated by
the lack of anticonvulsant activity of the 7methylated analogue of  xxxd3564xxx , which
demonstrates the same carbonic anhydraseinhibiting potency as  xxxd3564xxx .93 it should
be noted that, as with other drugs with
inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase (such
as acetazolamide or topiramate),  xxxd3564xxx  is
associated with the development of renal
calculi. the incidence of renal calculi in
patients treated with  xxxd3564xxx  is listed as
uncommon (0.1%y1%) in the european summary of product characteristics.94 however,
although  xxxd3564xxx  has only a weak-inhibiting
effect on carbonic anhydrase, caution is warranted when administering  xxxd3564xxx  with
other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

discussion
this review of the literature suggests
that  xxxd3564xxx  acts at multiple sites in the
brain to reduce levels of epileptiform activity. its predominant mechanisms of action
are related to inhibition of sustained highfrequency repetitive firing of na+-dependent
action potentials and a reduction in lowthreshold t-type ica. it is well established
that aeds that act on na+ and t-type  xxxg293xxx +
channels have beneficial effects in simple,
partial, and generalized tonic-clonic and
absence seizures. a similar broad spectrum
of activity is therefore predicted from pharmacological activity of  xxxd3564xxx  at these
sites and is supported by clinical experience.
 xxxd3564xxx  also alters dopamine, 5-ht, and
acetylcholine metabolism, but it remains
unclear how far these actions contribute to
the clinical effects of the drug. in contrast to
some other aeds,  xxxd3564xxx  has no apparent effect on gaba function.  xxxd3564xxx 
administration has been associated with
inhibition of glutamate release, although this

may be an indirect effect, mediated by its
action on voltage-gated na+ or  xxxg293xxx + channels. an emerging and interesting element of
the mechanism of action of  xxxd3564xxx  is its
potential neuroprotective effects, which may
limit the neuronal damage caused by recurrent seizures. this neuroprotective activity
of  xxxd3564xxx  has been demonstrated at a
cellular and biochemical level.
the effects of  xxxd3564xxx  in a wide
variety of epileptic syndromes may also be
caused by multiple modes of action because
different seizure types may respond to different modes of action.1 in addition, this broad
range of mechanisms of action may increase
the likelihood of  xxxd3564xxx  acting in a
complimentary manner to other concomitant aeds.
the actions of  xxxd3564xxx  on neurotransmitters may contribute to the beneficial
effects reported in parkinson disease, which
may be a result of the enhanced basal
dopamine levels observed after  xxxd3564xxx 
administration. 30,95,96 increases in basal
monoamine levels after  xxxd3564xxx  administration may be, in part, responsible for the
therapeutic effects of  xxxd3564xxx  seen in the
treatment of bipolar depression.33 in addition,
gaba potentiation has been suggested as a
key factor underlying the mood-modulating
properties of aeds97,98 which may help
account for the beneficial effects seen with
 xxxd3564xxx  in the management of bipolar
disorder.33,99,32
as may be expected with any centrally
acting drug, the adverse effects most commonly seen with  xxxd3564xxx  are cns related
(eg, somnolence, dizziness, and nausea).
however,  xxxd3564xxx  is well tolerated by
patients with epilepsy during long-term therapy,8 and adverse events are typically mild to
moderate in intensity and can frequently be
managed with dose adjustment.100
in view of the multiple underlying
causes and mechanisms of epileptic seizures,
an aed such as  xxxd3564xxx , which has a
combination of complementary mechanisms
of action, may provide a potential treatment
option for a variety of epileptic syndromes.
