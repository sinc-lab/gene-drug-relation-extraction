abstract: the expression of a membrane-associated  xxxg807xxx  (fr) was elevated in spleen samples
from patients with chronic (cml) and acute (aml) myelogenous leukemias compared with normal spleen.
contrary to earlier reports, antibodies to a purified f r from placenta cross-reacted quantitatively with this
protein in solution radioimmunoassays. similar to fr-a (kb cells) and fr-8 (placenta), the protein was
released from the membrane by phosphatidylinositol-specificphospholipase c, indicating a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) membrane anchor. screening of a cdna library from c m l spleen with a heterologous
murine f r cdna and also amplification of f r cdnas from spleen and bone marrow in cml, aml,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (all) by polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) using degenerate oligonucleotides yielded cdna clones representing fr-p, a novel f r (type r),
and an aberrant transcript of fr-7 with a 2 base pair deletion resulting in a truncated 104-residue polypeptide;
fr-a was not detected in these tissues. the cdna for fr--y predicts a 243-residue polypeptide with an
amino acid sequence homology of 71% and 79% with fr-a and fr-0, respectively, a 23-residue aminoterminal signal peptide, and 3 potential sites for n-linked glycosylation. transfection of cos-1 cells with
the cdna for fr-7 resulted in low expression of a [3h]foli~
acid binding protein on the cell surface that
was gpi-anchored. pcr analysis of total r n a from a number of normal and malignant tissues and cell
lines indicated a limited tissue specificity of fr-7. fr-7 and fr-0 could thus be potential differentiation
markers in hematopoiesis and potential therapeutic targets in certain malignancies.

the two known isoforms of the human cell surfaceassociated high-affinity  xxxg807xxx  (fr) are homologous
polypeptides of mr -28 000 that are n-glycosylated and
attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(gpi)anchor (ratnam et al., 1989;sadasivan & rothenberg,
1989; elwood, 1989; lacey et al., 1989; luhrs & sloliamy,
1989; verma et al., 1992). although a dual functional role
has been proposed for fr, le., cellular transport of folate
compounds/anti-folates [reviewed in antony (1992); jansen
et al., 1990; westerhof et al., 1991;luhrs et al., 1992; matsue
et al., 19921 and stimulation of cell growth in primary bone
marrow cultures (antony et al., 1991), the physiological
significance of fr expression in various tissues is still unclear.
nevertheless, fr levels are greatly elevated in a variety of
malignant tissues compared with normal tissues, suggesting
a potential role for fr in tumor targeting either with frspecific antibodies or with novel anti-folate drugs (campbell
et al., 1991; coney et al., 1991; weitman et al., 1992; ross
et al., 1994).
fr type a (kb cells) and type /3 (placenta) have opposite
stereospecificities and quite different (2-fold to 100-fold)
affinities for folate coenzymes and anti-folates (wang et al.,
1992). furthermore, the two isoforms are differentially
regulated in various tissues, showing a general tendency toward
elevation of fr-a in malignant tissues of epithelial origin and
elevation of fr-/3in maligancies of nonepithelial origin (ross
& ratnam, 1992; ross et al., 1994).

our interest in identifyingfolate binding proteins in leukemic
cells was based on earlier reports that spleen tissue in chronic
myelogenousleukemia (cml) expressed relatively high levels
of a membrane-associated [ 3 h ] f ~ acid
l i ~ binding protein that
did not cross-react with polyclonal antibodies raised against
purified placental fr (sadasivan et al., 1986,1987). herein,
we present our results on the molecular and immunochemical
characterization of fr in spleen and bone marrow samples
obtained from normal individualsand from patients with cml,
acute myelogenous leukemia (aml), chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (cll), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (all).
we also characterize a novel fr isoform and its alternatively
spliced product and examine its tissue specificity.

materials and methods
crude plasma membranes. approximately 0.5 g of frozen
tissue was pulverized and homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold
20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5,lo mm edta, and
1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. the samples were
centrifuged at approximately looog for 5 min at 4 "c to
sediment nuclei and debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 30000g for 45 min at 4 "c. the pellet was
resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm sodium acetate buffer
(ph 3.5)/150mmnaclusingasyringeanda 21-gaugendle
with the orifice opposed to the wall of the glass container in
order to obtain a fine suspension. the samples were centrifuged at 30000g for 20 min at 4 oc, and the supernatants
were discarded. this step removed endogenously bound folates
in the samples. (additional acid washes did not expose any
more [ 3 h ] f ~ lacid
i ~ binding sites.) the membranes were
washed with 5 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph
7.5)/ 150mm nacl by resuspendingand centrifuging as above.
the resulting membrane pellets were dissolved in 1 ml of 10

mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, 150 mm sodium
chloride, and 0.5% triton x-100, and the insoluble material
was removed by centrifugation.
[3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding assay. the [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding
assay was performed both by direct binding of [3h] xxxd2146xxx 
to membranes and by a solution-phase assay (wang et al.,
1992). in the direct binding assay, membrane samples (10100 pg of protein) were incubated with 3 pmol of [3h]folic
acid (moravek) (40 ci/mmol) in 10 mm sodium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.5)/150 mm  xxxg2020xxx /10 mm edta for 30 min
at 37 oc with constant agitation. the membranes were
sedimented at 12ooog for 15 min, washed once with the same
buffer, dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph
7.5)/150 mm nacl/l% triton x-100, and subjected liquid
scintillation counting. nonspecific binding of [3h] xxxd2146xxx 
was determined for both the assays by performing the assay
in each case simultaneously with controls in which the addition
of [3h] xxxd2146xxx  was preceded by incubation for 5 min at
room temperature with 100 pmol of unlabeled  xxxd2146xxx . the
assays are quantitative for both fr-a and fr-8.
protein and antibodies. fr was purified from human
placenta as described (ratnam et al., 1989). rabbit antisera
against the placental fr were produced and fr-specific
antibodies were affinity-purified using placental fr coupled
to sepharose as described (ratnam et al., 1989).
immunoprecipitation. three picomoles of either purified
fr or fr in the form of a plasma membrane extract in 10
mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.5)/150 mm nacl/l%
triton x-100 was incubated in this buffer (0.3 ml) with a
stoichiometric amount of [ 3 h ] f ~ lacid
i ~ for 30 min at 37 oc
followed by the addition of various amounts of the primary
antibody. after incubating for 1 h at 37 oc, 30 pl of goat
anti-rat igg-coupled sepharose 4b (cappel) was added. the
suspension was agitated overnight at 4 "c. the sepharose
beads were then sedimented by centrifuging for 2 min at
1oooog, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was estimated
by liquid scintillation counting. the decrease in the radioactivity in the supernatant was monitored as a measure of
antibody binding to fr. in control samples, either the primary
antibody or the receptor was excluded.
immunoblotting. total membrane protein (10 pg) from
fr-y-transfected cos-1 cells was electrophoresedon a sodium
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel followedby electroblotting
onto nitrocellulose and probing with affinity-purified antibodies to placental fr as described previously (wang et al.,
1992). total protein from 1 ml of cell culture media, collected
at the time of harvesting fr-y-transfected cos-1 cells, was
precipitated by treatment with 10% trichloroacetic acid
followed by sedimentation for 15 min at 12ooog. the
precipitate was washed with 1 ml of acetone, dried, and
subjected to electrophoresis and western blotting as described
for the membrane proteins.
treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc). fr in the plasma membrane preparation
was saturated with [ 3 h ] f ~ lacid
i ~ by incubating with a 2-fold
molar excess of the radioligand in 50 mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.5)/
10 mm edta (buffer b) at 4 oc for 30 min with constant
agitation. the membranes were sedimented at 1oooog in a
microfuge at 4 oc. the membranes were then resuspended
in the same buffer and sedimented again at 4 oc. the washed
pellets were resuspended again in the above buffer, and 10-pl
aliquots were incubated in the absence or in the presence of
0.5 unit of pi-plc in a final volume of 50 pl of buffer b for
3.5 h at 37 oc with intermittent agitation. the membranes
were sedimented as above, and 30 pl of the supernatant was

rna and pcr analysis. total rna from 0.5-1.0 g of
tissue was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/
chloroform single-stepextraction method (stratagene). total
rna from the bone marrow samples was kindly provided by
curt i. civin, m.d. when taq polymerase was used for the
pcr reaction, the 10-pl reverse transcription reaction
contained 0.05 pg/pl total rna, 0.05 m kc1,o.ol m trishcl, ph 8.3, 5 mm mgc12, 1 mm each of  xxxd1148xxx , dctp,
 xxxd1837xxx , and dttp (gibco-brl), 1 unit/pl rnasin rnase
inhibitor (promega), random hexamer primers (5 x 10-4od
units/pl; usb), and mmlv-reverse transcriptase ( 5 units/
pl; gibco-brl). when vent polymerase was used for the
pcr reaction, the reverse transcription reaction (10 pl)
consisted of 0.05 pg/pl total rna, 0.01 m kcl, 0.01 m
(nh&304,0.02 m tris-hc1, ph 8.6, 5 mm mgs04, 0.01%
triton x- 100,l mm each of  xxxd1148xxx , dctp,  xxxd1837xxx , and dttp
(gibco-brl), 1 unit/pl rnasin rnaseinhibitor (promega),
random hexamer primers (5 x lo4 od units/pl; usb), and
mmlv-reverse transcriptase (5 units/pl; gibco-brl). in
either case, the reaction mixture was first incubated at room
temperature for 10 min to allow the random hexamer primers
to anneal. the temperature was raised to 42 oc and held at
this temperature for 15 min, and then stopped by heating at
99 oc for 6.5 min.
for pcr using taq polymerase, the entire reverse transcription product was combined with additional kcl/tris
buffer (the same concentration as in the reverse transcription
reaction except for mgc12, which was 2 mm), 0.15 pm of
each primer, and 1.25 units of taq polymerase in 50 pl. the
reaction mix was heated for 2 min at 95 oc. the pcr cycle
comprised 1 min at 95 oc followed by 1 min at 60 oc. after
25-35 cycles, the reaction was held at 60 "c for 6.5 min.
for pcr using vent polymerase, the entire reverse
transcription product was combined with additional kcl/
(nh&so4/tris/mgs04/triton buffer (the same concentration as in the reverse transcription reaction except for
mgs04 which was 2.6 mm), 1 unit of vent polymerase, and
0.1 5 pm of each primer in 50 pl. in both cases, the reaction
mix was heated for 2 min at 95 "c. the pcr cycle comprised
three steps: 1 min at 95 "c, 0.5 min at 60 oc, and 0.5 min
at 72 oc. after 35 cycles, the reaction was held at 72 oc for
6.5 min; 10-20 pl of each reaction was electrophoresed
through a 1.o% agarose gel containing 0.05 pg/ml ethidium
bromide. the dna was visualized by uv illumination.

folate receptors in hematopoietic cells
for tissue distribution studies of fr-y, the sensitivity of
the pcr was enhanced by using 32p-labeledprimer (cml4);
in the same pcr reaction tube, the cdna for @-actinwas
amplified using 32p-labeled primers @-actin 1 and p-actin 2)
as an internal control. the expected pcr products for fr-y
and @-actin were 361 base pairs and 661 base pairs,
respectively. in order to detect fr-a and fr-@,a common
primer (mf1) was labeled and used in combination with primer
m2 (for fr-a) or f1 (for fr-0). the expected pcr products
for fr-a and fr-@were 648 base pairs and 502 base pairs,
respectively. the labeling reaction was carried out in 50 mm
tris-hc1 (ph 7.6)/ 10 mm mgc12/5 mm dithiothreitol/o. 1

primer in a volume of 50 pl for 45 min at 37 oc followed by
heating at 68 oc for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. the
product was purified on a sephadex g-25 (sigma) column.
the pcr conditions were the same as stated above for taq
polymerase. unlabeled primers were added to the pcr
reactions to ensure the primers were not limiting in the reaction
due to any loss of the primers in the labeling and purification
procedure. for fr-y, the reaction was allowed to proceed
for 5 cycles with the unlabeled cml2 primer and the mixture
of labeled and unlabeled cml4 primers before adding the
@-actinprimers (the mixture of labeled and unlabeled). a
further 25 cycles were carried out. the entire 50 pl of each
reaction product was electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel. the gel was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. fr-a and fr-@were similarly detected using the
appropriate primers described above.
subcloning pcr products. pcr products generated by
vent polymerase were directly subcloned into the smai site
in the polylinker of pbluescript by blunt-end ligation for dna
sequence analysis.
cdna cloning and sequencing. a human cml cdna
library constructed in the expression vector xgt 11 was obtained
from clontech, inc., and plated on escherichia coli r y1090.
approximately 400 000 recombinant plaques were screened
using a radiolabeled dna probe. the dna probe was
prepared by labeling with [32p]datpa 722 bp avai and haeii
fragment of murine fr using the prime a gene labeling
system from promega. the cdna inserts were cut out with
ecori and subcloned into puc19 or pbluescript. sequencing
of the plasmids was carried out by the dideoxy sequencing
method using sequenase version 2.0 (usb).
expression in cos-1 cells. the full-length cdna for
fr-y was placed in the polylinker region of the expression
vector pcdnal neo (invitrogen), and the plasmid was
amplified in e. coli mc1061/p3. the resulting plasmid was
used to transfect cos- 1 cells using lipofectamine (bethesda
research laboratories) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. c o s - 1 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection.
untransfected cos-1 were used as the negative control in all
experiments.

immunoreactivity of membrane-associated
 xxxd2146xxx 
binding protein in cml and aml with anti-placental fr.
consistent with earlier reports on cml, when acid-washed
membrane preparations from normal spleen samples were
compared with those from cml and aml spleen, the level
of specific [3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding was significantly elevated
in the leukemic spleens (table 1). affinity-purified rabbit

1: radioimmunoprecipitation of membrane-associated fr
from tissue explants. [sh] xxxd2146xxx  was bound to fr solubilized
from crude membrane preparations and immunoprecipitated using
an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to purified placental fr
(fr-a plus fr-p) as described under materials and methods. the
tissues used were c m l spleen (a), aml spleen (e), myeloproliferative disorder spleen (w), kb cells (fr-a) (v),ovarian carcinoma
(fr-a) ( o ) , and meningioma (fr-8) (v). in control experiments,
either the primary antibody or the receptor was excluded.

polyclonal antibodies raised against purified human placental
frcross-reacted quantitatively with the [3h] xxxd2146xxx  bound
membrane protein in cml and aml (figure 1). in fact, the
immunoprecipitation curves for the leukemic samples overlapped closely both with placental fr (fr-a plus fr-@)and
withthefrinkbcells (fr-a) (figure 1). thisresult suggests
that the protein that is elevated in the leukemic spleens is
identical either to a placental fr (fr-a or fr-@)or to a
homologous fr isoform.
the result in figure 1 is at variance with earlier reports
(sadasivan et al., 1986, 1987) that the membrane-associated
 xxxg807xxx  in cml spleen did not cross-react with
antibodies to placental fr. one explanation for this discrepancy could be that the particular sampleof leukemic spleen
used in those studies did express a  xxxg807xxx  that
was structurally unrelated to fr. however, we did not
encounter such a protein in any of the leukemic spleens in this
study, although they invariably showed elevated fr levels. a
second possibility is a difference in the quality of the antibodies
used in the two studies, such as a difference in the fraction
of the antibody directed against tissue-specific carbohydrate
epitopes on the protein.

gpi-specific phospholipase c, indicating a gpi membrane
anchor for the protein. it has been previously established

that fr is a gpi-anchored protein. this result is further
evidence that the elevated membrane folate binder in cml
and aml spleen is a member of the fr family and not a
structurally unrelated protein.
identification of the fr in leukemic spleen and bone
marrow. we undertook two complementary approaches to
identify the fr in normal and various pathologic specimens
of spleen including cml, aml, cll, and lymphoproliferative
and myeloproliferative disorders. we also examined bone
marrow samples from cml, aml, and all.
one approach was to amplify all fr cdnas in the samples
using rna-pcr with two degenerate oligonucleotideprimers.
the pcr primers (search 1 and search 2, see materials

and methods) were designed so as to correspond to 30 bases
in conserved regions of fr-a, fr-p, and the two murine fr
sequences (brigle et al., 1991) with complete degeneracy in
the ultimate and penultimate bases at the 3’ends. the primers
spanned a 588 base pair fragment of fr-a, fr-p, and murine
frs. in control experiments, the primers amplified the
expected fragment from total rna samples containing
mrnas for fr-a, fr-p, and murine fr. vent polymerase
was used in these experiments in order to minimize potential
“pcr errors”. the amplified cdna fragments were subcloned into the vector pbluescript, and the partial cdna clones
were sequenced.
in the second approach, a cdna library prepared from a
cml spleen sample in xgtl 1 was screened using a 722 base
pair cdna fragment in the coding region of a mouse fr
(brigle et al., 1991). the mouse fr cdna was chosen as
a probe rather than a human fr cdna in order to minimize
bias for the selection of any one type of human fr in the
screening procedure. forty-five positive clones were obtained,
and the cdna inserts were subcloned into pbluescript for
sequencing.
by both the above methods, two types of fr were identified

4: western blot analysis of membranes and media from
transfected cos- 1 cells expressing fr-y. membrane proteins ( 10
pg) from cos-1 cells transfected with the vector pcdnal neo
(lane 1) or from cos-1 cells transfected with pcdnal neo
containing the cdna for fr-y (lane 2) and proteins precipitated
from 1 ml of fr-y-transfected cos-i cell culture media (lane 3 )
were subjected to western blotting and probing with affinity-purified
polyclonal antibodies to placental fr as described under materials
and methods.

expression and membrane-anchoringoffr-y. transient
expression of fr-y in cos-1 cells resulted in relatively low
[3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding activity in the cell membrane (table
2). treatment with pi-plc released fr-y quantitatively
from the membranes (table 2), indicating a gpi membrane
anchor for fr-y. expression of fr-y in the transfected cos
cell membranes was observed by western blot analysis using
affinity-purified polyclonal anti-placental fr antibody as
probe (figure 4). the protein expressed in cos-1 cells
appeared as closely spaced bands of mr 32 000 (figure 4);
the multiple bands in the western blot in all likelihood
represent microheterogeneity in the n-linked glycosylation
as seen for other fr isoforms (ratnam et al., 1989). fr-y
was not detected in the cell culture medium from the shortterm-transfected cos-1 cells (figure 4).
tissue distribution of fr-y. using pcr primers (cml2
and cml4, see materials and methods) specific for fr-y
(figure 5), total rna samples (0.5 pg) from a number of
normal and malignant tissues and established tumor cell lines
were analyzed for the presence of the mrna for fr-y (table
3). the sensitivityof the pcr method was enhanced by using
a 32p-labeledoligonucleotide primer followed by autoradiography of a polyacrylamide electrophoretic gel of the pcr
products (figure 5). the cdna for @-actinin each sample
was amplified as an internal control (figure 5). due to the
overabundance of the transcript for @-actin,the primers for
its amplification were added after the first five pcr cycles
(material and methods). as seen in table 3, the mrna for
fr-y (or fr-7’) was detected in certain carcinomas (ovarian,
cervical, uterine) and in tissue sources of hematopoietic cells
such as normal or malignant spleen, bone marrow, and thymus.
furthermore, when pcr primers specific for fr-a (mfl
and m2) and fr-@(mfi and f1) were used, fr-@but not
fr-a was detected in the samples of spleen, bone marrow,
and thymus (results not shown). thus, fr-@and fr-y were
the only receptor isoforms expressed in the normal and
leukemic hematopoietic cells in this study. a variety of other
normal and malignant tissues tested did not express significant
amounts of fr-r (table 3). further studies should reveal
the relative levels of fr-y in various tissues and its cell-type
specificity.
the foregoing results clearly show that the high-affinity
[3h] xxxd2146xxx  binding protein in normal and leukemic spleen
and bone marrow is represented by fr type @, which was one
of the receptor isoforms originally identified in placenta, and/
or a novel homologous protein (fr-y). the soluble folate

fr-y (fr-y’) that is possibly the result of alternative splicing
was also found (figure 2). fr-y’ was the result of a 2-base
(ta) deletion resulting in a stop codon and a 139 amino acid
carboxyl-terminal deletion (figure 2). since the cdna for
fr-y’ is identical in sequence to fr-y (including the 3‘- and
5’-untranslated regions) except for the two-base deletion, fry’ is in all likelihood an alternatively spliced product of the
gene for fr-y and is not encoded by a separate gene. fr-a
was not detected in the above experiments, suggesting either
its completeabsenceor the occurrenceof relativelyinsignificant
amounts of fr-a.
structure of fr-y. the cdna for fr-y predicts a 243residue polypeptide with a 23-residue amino-terminal signal
peptide (figure 2). fr-y has an amino acid sequence
homology of 7 1% and 79%, respectively, with fr-a and fr@, 16 conserved cysteine residues, and 3 potential sites for
n-linked glycosylation (figures 2 and 3). the carboxylterminal sequences of fr-a and fr-@are represented by 30
and 19 unconserved hydrophobic amino acids, respectively;
the carboxyl-terminal sequence of fr-y is unusual in that it
is represented by 16 hydrophobic amino acids in a sequence
that is interrupted by charged amino acid residues (aspartic
acid at the second position and arginine at the sixth position
from the carboxyl terminus), perhaps lowering gpi signal
efficiency (figure 3).

of certain malignant tissues. the physiological significance
of alternative splicing of fr-7 is at present unclear, although
the resulting truncated polypeptide may be expected to be
secreted because it lacks a membrane-anchoring domain.

5: detection of the mrna for fr-y in representative tissue
samples by (nonquantitative) rna-pcr analysis. total r n a
prepared for various tissues was analyzed using 32p-labeled primers
specific for fr-y and &actin as described under materials and
methods. arrows indicate the positions of specific pcr products
obtained for fr-7 (361 base pairs) or &actin (661 base pairs). the
samples shown in this figure are the following; lanes 1, 2, and 3
(0.005,0.05,and 0.5 pg, respectively, of total rna), cml spleen;
lane 4,normal spleen (0.5 pg of total rna); lane 5, meningioma (0.5
pg of total rna); lane 6, ovary carcinoma (0.5 pg of total rna);
lane 7, kb cells (0.5 pg of total rna). because of the abundance
of mrna for 0-actin, the primers for @-actinwere introduced after
the first five pcrcycles (as described under materials and methods).

binding proteins (sfbps) isolated from leukemic spleen
(sadasivan et al., 1986, 1987) are in all likelihood derived
from fr-6 or fr-7 since (a) frs have been clearly shown
to be the precursors of sfbps in kb cells and placenta (luhrs
& soliamy, 1989; verma et al., 1992; antony et al., 1989;
elwood et al., 1991) and (b) the soluble and membraneassociated folate binding proteins in leukemic spleen were
immunologicallycross-reactive(sadasivan et al., 1986,1987).
serum sfbp is elevated in cancer and several pathologicstates
(rothenberg & da costa, 1971; corrocher et al., 1979;
rochman et al., 1985). molecular characterization of these
serum fbps and identification of their isoform types may
enable their exploitation as serum markers. further investigations should also explore the value of fr-p and fr-7 as
cell-surface markers for certain hematopoieticcell types. the
structural, functional, and regulatory differences among the
fr isoforms may enable their exploitation for differential
transport of novel types of anti-folatesand for immunotargeting
