abstract
 xxxd2884xxx , 2-(2, xxxd2884xxx , was originally developed as an antianginal drug in the 1970s. despite its success, its use diminished due to the occurrence of
poorly understood side effects including neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in a small proportion of patients. recently,  xxxd2884xxx ’s mechanism of action and the molecular basis of its
toxicity have been elucidated.  xxxd2884xxx  reduces fatty acid metabolism through the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for mitochondrial uptake of
long-chain  xxxd2154xxx . the corresponding shift to greater carbohydrate utilization increases
myocardial efficiency (work done per unit oxygen consumption) and this oxygen-sparing
effect explains its antianginal efficacy.  xxxd2884xxx ’s side effects are attributable to high
plasma concentrations occurring with standard doses in patients with impaired metabolism
due to cyp2d6 mutations. accordingly, dose modification in these poorly metabolizing
patients identified through therapeutic plasma monitoring can eliminate any significant
side effects. herein we detail  xxxd2884xxx ’s pharmacology with particular emphasis on its
mechanism of action and its side effects. we discuss how therapeutic plasma monitoring
has led to  xxxd2884xxx ’s safe reintroduction into clinical practice and how recent clinical data
attesting to its safety and remarkable efficacy led to a renaissance in its use in both refractory

angina and chronic heart failure. finally, we discuss the application of pharmacogenetics
in combination with therapeutic plasma monitoring to potentially broaden  xxxd2884xxx ’s use
in heart failure, aortic stenosis, and other cardiac conditions.

introduction
 xxxd2884xxx  has a long, eventful, and at times painful history. having been developed by
richardson–merrell pharmaceuticals in the late 1960s,  xxxd2884xxx  was first marketed in
france and subsequently elsewhere during the 1970s as an antianginal agent.  xxxd2884xxx  has
been a popular and effective treatment for angina, having the almost unique property compared to other agents of that time of not inducing intolerable reductions in blood pressure or
heart rate. however, a small number of cases of severe hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity led
to a rapid decline in its use. although by 1988 many countries worldwide had followed the
trend set by the united kingdom in 1985 of removing  xxxd2884xxx  from the market,  xxxd2884xxx  continued to be prescribed in some countries, especially australia and new zealand.
in these countries, although prescribed with care, it continues to confer great benefits upon
patients who have little else in terms of treatment options (inglis and stewart, 2006). here
we will review the chemistry and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2884xxx  and relate them to the
now better-understood mechanism of  xxxd2884xxx ’s toxicity. in doing so we describe how,
with simple and cost-effective therapeutic plasma monitoring, this toxicity can be easily
avoided. one of the principal developments in facilitating  xxxd2884xxx ’s return to patient care
has been a detailed understanding of the genetics underlying its metabolism. accordingly,
one of the central features of this review will be to consider the basic pharmacogenetic
data regarding  xxxd2884xxx  and relate these to the potential for genetic testing to avoid side
effects. finally, we will outline its clinical efficacy as a novel therapy in a variety of cardiac
conditions ranging from angina to heart failure in order to demonstrate how its theoretical
mode of action translates into effective clinical care.

chemistry
 xxxd2884xxx  is 2-(2, xxxd2884xxx  (fig. 1) and can be prepared through
the catalytic hydrogenation of 2-(2,2-diphenylethenyl)pyridine. consistently high yields can
be ensured by the application of a raney nickel catalyst (nickel–aluminium alloy) to facilitate
this reduction. although  xxxd2884xxx  hydrochloride is clinically effective, pharmaceutical
preparations contain  xxxd2884xxx ’s maleate salt.  xxxd2884xxx  salts form a white, odorless,
aqueously soluble, and crystalline powder, which melts at approximately 245◦ c.
chemically,  xxxd2884xxx  consists of a –ch-ch 2 carbon chain backbone with three sixmembered rings. two of these are saturated cyclohexane rings and the remaining one is a
pyridine group (a heterocyclic amine with a six-membered ring containing five carbon atoms
and one nitrogen atom). each of the six-membered rings assumes a chair conformation;
the molecule, however, lacks any overall symmetry. the cyclohexane residues are strongly
hydrophobic. the pyridine group forms hydrogen bonds with the maleate oxygen atoms and
is hydrophilic. the molecule as a whole is thus amphiphilic (or amphipathic). although the
maleate ion is planar, the hydrogen bonds formed between  xxxd2884xxx  and its maleate group
are slightly out of this plane. because  xxxd2884xxx  forms hydrogen bonds with the maleate

carboxyl groups, it had been proposed by some investigators, based purely on chemical and
structural considerations, that reminiscent of this maleate interaction,  xxxd2884xxx ’s putative
biological
targets might also have a group equivalent to two oxygen atoms separated by
❛
4.49 a. however, attempts to predict  xxxd2884xxx ’s function based on structural similarities
with other molecules (e.g., the histamine h 1 receptor antagonist—carbinoxamine) have not
proved insightful due the dissimilarity of even these seemingly similar molecules (dawson
et al. 1986).
pharmaceutical preparations of  xxxd2884xxx  contain a racemic mixture of (+) and (–)
enantiomers. as will be discussed,  xxxd2884xxx  is metabolized to one of its six monohydroxy metabolites or its dihydroxy metabolites. these include a cis, trans-1, and trans-2
monohydroxy variant for each enantiomer. the predominant metabolites are the cis-4-axial
and to a lesser extent the trans-4 equatorial monohydroxyperhexiline diastereoisomers.
these are depicted in figure 2 (davies et al. 2006a, 2006b).

pharmacology
mechanism of action (table 1)
interest in the development of  xxxd2884xxx  was aroused by the physiological success of
the related compound hexadylamine. although principally investigated in isolated perfused
heart preparations, hexadylamine was noted to exhibit vasodilation effects. specifically,
hexadylamine’s efficacy as a coronary vasodilation was the major impetus for the evaluation of its derivatives as antianginal agents. although the mechanism of vasodilation
was never fully delineated, it was noted that despite the increased cardiac output, cardiac
work remained constant in the context of a reduced cardiac oxygen extraction. in effect,
hexadylamine increased cardiac oxygen efficiency (rowe et al. 1963).  xxxd2884xxx  was
similarly extensively studied using pharmacological techniques in animals (hudak et al.
1973).

fig. 2. the six different  xxxd2884xxx  metabolites.  xxxd2884xxx  is metabolized to one of its six monohydroxy
metabolites or its dihydroxymetabolites. these include a cis, trans-1 and trans-2 monohydroxy variant for each
enantiomer (from davies et al. drug metab dispos 2006).

these investigations revealed that  xxxd2884xxx  was both a coronary and a systemic vasodilator. this effect was independent of the adrenergic system. by systemic administration
 xxxd2884xxx , 0.0055 mg/kg i.v, increased coronary and femoral blood flow despite a fall in
systemic blood pressure (–13% to –49% with 0.3 to 3 mg/kg i.v.). this finding contrasted
with nitrates, which, when given systemically, reduced blood pressure at the expense of
femoral blood flow (hudak et al. 1970). these coronary vasodilator effects may reflect the
weak l-type calcium channel-blocking effect of  xxxd2884xxx ; however, as the experiments

were performed with intravenous preparations, their relevance to oral dosing with the drug is
uncertain. with this proviso in mind, such rapid loading of high systemic  xxxd2884xxx  doses
was noted to initially cause a transient positive chronotropic effect, which was followed by
a more prolonged negative chronotropic effect (hudak et al. 1973). these effects were also
independent of the adrenergic system, as they were resistant to reserpine and propranolol.
to further understand the direct effects of  xxxd2884xxx  on the cardiovascular system, a
canine right heart perfusion model was employed. by manipulating the cardiac perfusion
rate from 37 ml/kg/min to 47 ml/kg/min, it was possible to assess the effect of  xxxd2884xxx 
on the mechanical properties of the heart. accordingly, after 1–2 mg/kg i.v. of  xxxd2884xxx ,
the calculated left ventricular work (blood pressure × cardiac output) decreased. moreover,
the index of left ventricular efficiency (change in left ventricular work/change in myocardial
oxygen consumption) was increased with  xxxd2884xxx  (cho et al. 1970). these experiments
were indicative of the unique property of  xxxd2884xxx  to improve the parameters of mechanical cardiac function while at the same time increasing cardiac metabolic efficiency.
in order to further confirm this unique effect on the heart, as distinct from changes to
the systemic circulation,  xxxd2884xxx  and nitrates were injected directly into the circumflex
branch of the left coronary artery in order to minimize the systemic effects and markedly
increase coronary blood flow in a dose-dependent manner (hudak et al. 1970). this increased coronary blood flow has been previously associated with increased coronary sinus
oxygen concentration. this was again interpreted to imply that  xxxd2884xxx  improves cardiac
efficiency.
in order to assess the relevance of these animal models to  xxxd2884xxx  administration in
humans, pepine et al. (1973, 1974) assessed the effects of  xxxd2884xxx  in patients with angina
pectoris with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. a full range of metabolic and
invasive hemodynamic assessments was performed in patients given 200 mg of  xxxd2884xxx 
twice a day for 2 weeks. recapitulating the findings in the animal models,  xxxd2884xxx 
decreased heart rate but increased stroke volume and exercise tolerance with reduced angina.
it is notable that in contrast to the intravenous studies and akin to the clinical findings, there
was only a modest reduction in exercise heart rate and the blood pressure was essentially
unchanged. furthermore, in order to provide a controlled experimental protocol, these
patients were atrially paced. in this context  xxxd2884xxx  increased cardiac output despite
a lower left ventricular filling pressure. corresponding to the preceding animal models,
 xxxd2884xxx  notably increased coronary lactate extraction while maintaining a fixed oxygen
extraction. these experiments again implied that  xxxd2884xxx  induces a shift in cardiac
metabolism toward more efficient utilization of carbohydrates. the mechanism for this
increased efficiency was elusive.
based on the observations that  xxxd2884xxx  increases myocardial metabolic efficiency
and coronary lactate extraction vaughan williams proposed that  xxxd2884xxx  may shift
myocardial metabolism from principally fatty acid toward greater carbohydrate metabolism
(kennedy et al. 1996). this hypothesis fit well with the physiological observations; because
 xxxd2154xxx  consume more oxygen per unit atp produced, the conversion to increased
carbohydrate metabolism (including lactate) would serve to increase myocardial energy
production at a lower oxygen cost (faadiel et al. 2004). consistent with this hypothesis,
both ex vivo rat heart preparations and hepatocytes treated for 72 h with  xxxd2884xxx  showed
reduced beta-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  (deschamps et al. 1994). despite these physiological
studies, the substrate for  xxxd2884xxx  remained elusive. based on a suspicion derived from
the fact that several agents that similarly blocked fatty acid metabolism were carnitine

palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1) inhibitors, horowitz hypothesized in 1996 that  xxxd2884xxx 
might be another cpt inhibitor. this was prescient as it was proven that  xxxd2884xxx  was
indeed a potent cardiac cpt-1 (and cpt-2) inhibitor and inhibits long-chain fatty acid
metabolism (kennedy et al. 1996, 2000).
the evidence for  xxxd2884xxx ’s role as a potent cpt-1 and cpt-2 inhibitor was derived from classical pharmacological studies in which homogenates of heart and liver from
male sprague–dawley rats were isolated and treated with  xxxd2884xxx . tritiated palmitoylcarnitine,  xxxd2832xxx -coa, and carnitine were used to assess the kinetics of mitochondrial
fatty acid transport in the presence and absence of  xxxd2884xxx . lineweaver-burk, dixon, and
yonetani-theorell plots were employed and kinetic parameters derived. these studies were
highly informative. they confirmed that  xxxd2884xxx  was indeed a potent cpt-1 inhibitor and
demonstrated that  xxxd2884xxx  was more potent at inhibiting cardiac mitochondrial cpt-1
than hepatic mitochondria in vitro. specifically, the half-maximal inhibition (ic 50 ) of  xxxd2884xxx  in heart and liver mitochondria was 77 and 148 µmol/l, respectively. moreover, it
was noted that due to  xxxd2884xxx ’s amphipathic nature, it tended to become concentrated
in tissues (up to 30-fold higher in the heart than in plasma). the concentrations achieved in
the vicinity of cardiac mitochondrial cpt-1 are thought to exceed even this value. finally,
the endogenous cpt-1 inhibitor malonyl-coa was known to bind cpt-1 at two sites and
inhibited the enzyme at a cytoplasmic regulatory site remote from the active site. from
these kinetic studies and the use of nagarse (a protease applied by kashfi and cook [1992],
capable of altering the cytoplasmic component of cpt-1 molecule), it was inferred that
although  xxxd2884xxx  was a competitive inhibitor of cpt-1 and competed for the malonyl
coa binding site, unlike malonyl-coa and other cpt-1 inhibitors, it appeared to act at a
protected mitochondrial site not amenable to proteolysis (kennedy et al. 1996).
the identification of cpt-1 as  xxxd2884xxx ’s major biochemical site of inhibition has
proved most illuminating.  xxxd2884xxx  is one member of a disparate family of drugs termed
fatty acid oxidation inhibitors (faois) due to their capacity to inhibit fatty acid metabolism
in the myocardium and in other tissues (fig. 3). a subgroup of these agents, including
etomoxir, oxfenicine, and to a lesser extent, amiodarone inhibits fatty acid oxidation at the
cpt-1 level. a well-known faoi is the antianginal agent  xxxd3437xxx  that has been used
effectively for decades (lee et al. 2004). although its major mechanism of action remains
controversial, its predominant action probably involves beta-oxidation by inhibiting long-chain
3-ketoacyl coa thiolase (lc 3-kat), thereby reducing fatty acid oxidation (lopaschuk et
al. 2003). in addition,  xxxd3437xxx  is a weak cpt-1 inhibitor (ic 50 = 3 mmol/l). although
it reacts with the enzyme at a site similar to that of  xxxd2884xxx ,  xxxd3437xxx  is two orders
of magnitude less potent than  xxxd2884xxx  (ic 50 = 77 µmol/l). it is unlikely that cpt-1
inhibition plays an important role in the mechanism of action of  xxxd3437xxx  (kennedy
and horowitz, 1998).
the consequences of inhibiting cardiac fatty acid metabolism are profound. based on
simple stoichiometry the energy liberated per unit of carbon metabolized is higher for
lipids than for carbohydrates (298 vs. 223 kcal/mole of c2 units, respectively). when carbohydrates are oxidized, less oxygen is required to produce each molecule of atp (veech,
2004). an approximately 12% increase in oxygen efficiency would be expected if fatty
acid metabolism would be completely converted to carbohydrate metabolism (faadiel et
al. 2004). although experimental observations confirm the oxygen-sparing effect of carbohydrate metabolism, in practice, predominant carbohydrate utilization is at least 30% to
40% more efficient than predominant free fatty acid utilization, and in some experimental

fig. 3. the sites of action of the different fatty acid oxidation inhibitors (faois). a number of different sites
might be envisaged for faois to be effective. these range from (a) cell membrane inhibitors of fatp/cd36,
(b) mitochondrial carntine shuttle (cpt inhibitors), and (c) beta-fatty acid oxidation inhibitors. in practice the latter
two represent the clinically pertinent therapeutic targets. group (b) includes  xxxd2884xxx , etomoxir, oxfenicine,
and to a lesser extent amiodarone. group (c) includes  xxxd3437xxx  and  xxxd3083xxx . although  xxxd3437xxx  has
a significant provenance in ischemic heart disease, based on biochemical studies, it is likely to be less effective
than cpt inhibitors. it is notable that  xxxd2884xxx  inhibits both cpt-1 and cpt-2 (from lee et al. eur heart j
2004;25:634-641).

studies even more oxygen efficient. the reason for this unexpected oxygen efficiency may
relate to the property of  xxxd2154xxx  to increase uncoupling protein (ucp) expression and
activity.
ucps were thought originally to be involved in heat generation and to mitigate detrimental mitochondrial reaction, production of oxygen species, but they also reduce mitochondrial
energetic efficiency (faadiel et al. 2004). a final effect of some faois is their capacity to
work systemically. the inhibition of fatty acid metabolism in the liver may reduce systemic
ketone body levels and mitigate detrimental mitochondrial lipid metabolism.
being a competitive cpt-1 inhibitor,  xxxd2884xxx  is a partial faoi, unlike etomoxir,
which is an irreversible cpt-1 inhibitor (spurway et al. 1997). although in practice this
may prove to be a subtle distinction, especially if  xxxd2884xxx  levels are maintained, it does
imply that unlike  xxxd2884xxx , with etomoxir, high cellular fatty acid levels cannot overcome
cpt-1 inhibition. like etomoxir,  xxxd2884xxx  has both cardiac (and skeletal muscle) as well
as hepatic effects. this is unlike oxfenicine—another cpt-1 inhibitor whose cardiac (and
skeletal muscle) effects are more pronounced than its hepatic effects (stephens et al. 1985).
in experimental models  xxxd2884xxx  effectively reduces cardiac free fatty acid metabolism
and putatively increases carbohydrate metabolism. it also has systemic effects with a notable

impact on the liver (in which it accumulates). accordingly, it may confer increased efficiency upon the myocardium and, in principle, therefore, has potential use in disorders of
impaired cardiac energetics. this includes ischemic heart disease, congestive cardiac failure, aortic stenosis, and systemic associated heart disease (e.g., diabetes, obesity, and the
metabolic syndrome). in addition to the direct effects of  xxxd2884xxx  on myocardial fatty
acid metabolism, other unknown mechanisms have been invoked to explain  xxxd2884xxx ’s
efficiency (unger et al. 2005).
 xxxd2884xxx  is known to alter myocellular electrical activity through blockade of voltage
gated l-type calcium (barry et al. 1985) and sodium channels (grima et al. 1988).  xxxd2884xxx  is also known to block the voltage-dependent k v 1.5  xxxg1232xxx  in human
embryonic kidney cells (ic 50 = 1.5 µm) and also inhibits the ultra-rapidly activating k+
channel (i kur ), encoded by kv 1.5, in human atrial myocytes (rampe et al. 1995). at the
ventricular level  xxxd2884xxx  causes voltage- and frequency-dependent block of the human
ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) channel (ic 50 7.8 µm) (walker et al. 1999). the significance of these electrophysiological effects of  xxxd2884xxx  is unclear but  xxxd2884xxx  does
appear to cause a modest slowing of sinoatrial node activity and atrial conduction velocity.
there is little firm evidence that  xxxd2884xxx  has a profound impact on ventricular arrhythmias but there is a body of literature attesting to the capacity of  xxxd2884xxx  to reduce the
incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the context of ischemic heart disease
(ten eick and singer, 1973). although there was an early impression that the q-t period
was prolonged by  xxxd2884xxx , especially in those with k+ -channel mutations ( xxxg1268xxx ) or
when used with other agents that prolong q-t, once the q-t interval was corrected for rate,
the prolongation of q-t was not significant (drake et al. 1973). although of little apparent
significance,  xxxd2884xxx  causes a transient diuretic effect that is self-limited (czerwinski
et al. 1973).  xxxd2884xxx  can also reduce airway resistance in patients with asthma by 28%
in relation to baseline levels (hudak et al. 1973).
 xxxd2884xxx  increases platelet cgmp generation, largely via inhibition of neutrophil
nadph oxidase, and, consequently production (kennedy et al. 2006; willoughby et al.
2002).

pharmacokinetics
perhaps the most important advance in our understanding of  xxxd2884xxx  is in its
metabolism. the decline in  xxxd2884xxx ’s use was not a result of its poor efficacy; on the contrary, it was highly effective in the treatment of angina. instead, the reason for its withdrawal
related to its highly polymorphic and variable metabolism. this variability led to toxicity in
a small group of patients. a number of observations paved the way toward understanding
the role of pharmacokinetics in this toxicity:
1. singlas et al. (1978a, 1978b) observed that plasma  xxxd2884xxx  levels were elevated in
patients with long-term neuro- and hepatotoxicity relative to unaffected individuals.
2. shah et al. (1982) implicated the same mutation in  xxxd1818xxx  and  xxxd2884xxx 
metabolism as a basis for the toxicity of each of these drugs (i.e., anticipating the
delineation of cyp2d6 mutations).
3. horowitz et al. (1981) showed that metabolism of  xxxd2884xxx  in unselected individuals
with angina is nonlinear, implying the risk of disproportionate increases in  xxxd2884xxx 
levels with small increases in daily drug dosage.

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 1, 2007

84

h. ashrafian et al.
4. horowitz et al. (1986) showed that  xxxd2884xxx  toxicity in the long term can be obviated by adjusting dosage to standardize steady-state levels below those seen in toxic
patients.

to appreciate the now well-understood mechanism for  xxxd2884xxx ’s toxicity and how it
can be readily avoided, it is important to appreciate the pharmacogenetics of  xxxd2884xxx ’s
metabolism. although the cause of  xxxd2884xxx ’s variable toxicity was initially unclear, in
1982 shah et al. noted that neuropathy and later hepatic injury occurred only in patients with
 xxxd1818xxx  hydroxylation ratios >12.6. patients without neuropathy had normal  xxxd1818xxx  hydroxylation ratios.  xxxd1818xxx  is a now rarely used antihypertensive. however, in the
absence of a genetic technique to directly study the metabolic polymorphisms that modify
drug metabolism, the metabolism of a well-understood surrogate substrate can be used. by
determining the metabolic ratio, that is, the ratio of the blood or urinary concentration of the
parent drug over its metabolite in different individuals administered the test drug, different
polymorphic groups of drug metabolizers can be identified.  xxxd1818xxx  metabolism conforms to a complex distribution of  xxxd1818xxx :  xxxd1818xxx  4-hydroxylation ratios. patients
can be broadly divided into extensive metabolizers (ems) and poor metabolizers (pms).
ems excrete 10 to 200 times more of the urinary metabolite 4-hydroxydebrisoquin than
do pms. in summary, it was inferred that  xxxd1818xxx  and putatively  xxxd2884xxx  pms were
those susceptible to toxicity. corresponding to these  xxxd1818xxx  hydroxylation ratios, it was
accordingly observed that there was a clear bimodal distribution of  xxxd2884xxx  metabolizers. one group, (those without complications) had a plasma  xxxd2884xxx -to-metabolite ratio
of 0.3, whereas those with complications such as neuropathy had a ratio of 2.82 (singlas et
al. 1978a, 1978b).
 xxxd2884xxx  appears to be well absorbed orally. extensive bioavailability studies were
performed with  xxxd2884xxx  in the 1970s. although the single dose preparations of the radioactive crystal used in the study showed erratic absorption, when assessed in the multiple
dose study over 14 days, the vast majority of the patients averaged greater than 88% bioavailability. absorption was almost complete by 12 h of the dose. these studies confirmed that
 xxxd2884xxx  and metabolites continued to accumulate over time. it was confirmed that  xxxd2884xxx  metabolism primarily proceeds through oxidative pathways. the derivatives that
were primarily excreted through the urine were either monohydroxylated variants or in turn
their derivatives. dihydroxylated compounds were also identified in significant concentrations (wright et al. 1973).
having explicitly recognized the dependence of  xxxd2884xxx  metabolism on the ability
of the individual to oxidatively metabolize it in the liver, the molecular substrate for the
polymorphic variation in metabolism was left to be identified. once again recognizing
the importance of the  xxxd1818xxx  metabolizing pathway as a surrogate for other drug
metabolism pathways, an influential study showed that pms had negligible amounts of
the cytochrome p450 enzyme  xxxg588xxx . this enzyme was cloned and through sequencing
of cdnas from several pm livers; three variant messenger rnas were identified, which
represented incorrectly spliced db1 pre-mrna. in short, identification of the molecular
basis of this autosomally inherited trait provided a molecular explanation for the difference
between ems and pms (gonzalez et al. 1988). this member of the p450 family called
 xxxd1818xxx  hydroxylase was renamed cyp2d6 and was recognized to metabolize more
than 30 commonly used medications of different categories.

it is now recognized that 7% to 10% of u.s. and european caucasians are pms and harbor
mutations in cyp2d6. the prevalence of pms in african americans was far lower, at 1.9%
(evans et al. 1993). in the chinese, japanese, and korean populations, the incidence of pms
is even lower at approximately 1% (gardiner and begg, 2006). the protein product cyp2d6
is absent in pm livers and functional assays confirm the absence of cyp2d6 function. in the
ethnic variant studies, analysis of the molecular basis of these mutations has been studied
extensively. these mutations include point mutations at the intron 3/exon 4 splice site, a
single nucleotide deletion in exon 5, and complete deletion of the cyp2d6 gene. many
variants of the cyp2d6 gene are now recognized (http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm)
that both inactivate and activate the enzyme. genotyping of the common cyp2d6 variants
in patients of defined ethnicity has an accuracy of approximately 99% in predicting the
phenotype (gardiner and begg, 2006).
cyp2d6 genotype and activity are thus  xxxd2884xxx ’s predominant metabolic determinant. in preliminary in vitro studies corresponding to the studies performed in the  xxxd1818xxx  pms, the hepatic rate of  xxxd2884xxx  monohydroxylation across even a small
population of 20 patients varied dramatically. even within the group of ems, there was
a 5-fold variation in metabolic rate. using inhibitors to define the role of cyp2d6 in
these patients groups, it was observed that in ems, the k m of 3 µm with a v max of 9.1
pmol/min/mg microsomal protein. the corresponding values in the pms were: k m 124 µm
with a v max of 1.4 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein (sorensen et al. 2003). therefore, not
only were there intra group variations, but the variation between pms and ems was greater
than 100-fold. these in vitro data also confirmed the potentially saturable metabolism
of  xxxd2884xxx . in order to relate this in vitro data to in vivo data, initially a ratio of cisoh- xxxd2884xxx  metabolite/parent  xxxd2884xxx  plasma concentrations at steady state was
developed: c(i)(ohpx)/c(i)(px) (sallustio et al. 2002). at steady state, the frequency distributions of c(i)(ohpx)/c(i)(px) were consistent with cyp2d6  xxxd2884xxx  metabolism.
using this c(i)(ohpx)/c(i)(px) patients were categorized as pms, ems, and ultra-rapid
metabolizers (ums), with mean oral clearance values of 50.2, 428.3, and 1202.1 ml/min,
respectively. this categorization proved consistent with putative cyp2d6 metabolism and
also allowed the patients to be grouped into those requiring differing doses to attain steadystate equilibrium; patients thus divided into pms, ems, and ums required doses of 10–25,
100–250, and 300–500 mg/day, respectively.
confirmation of this role of cyp2d6 metabolism has a number of implications. the
implications for genotyping to predict patients who are at a significant risk of side effects is the most obvious and important implication, but this will be discussed later
(gardiner and begg, 2006). there are, however, more direct chemical implications of the
p450 cyp2d6 metabolic pathway. although  xxxd2884xxx  is predominantly metabolized to
its cis-4-monohydroxy derivative, the precise details of this metabolism remained elusive
until recently. it is important to recall that pharmaceutical preparations of  xxxd2884xxx  consist of a racemic mixture of (+) and (–) enantiomers. there are in total six potential cis
and trans derivatives (fig. 2). in order to understand how cyp2d6 determined the precise
metabolism of  xxxd2884xxx , detailed studies using cyp isoform-specific inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies directed against cyp isoforms, and recombinant expressed human cyp
enzymes were applied in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography to define the cyp isoform profile of phx 4-monohydroxylations (davies et al. 2006a, 2006b).
the most striking feature of these studies was that different  xxxd2884xxx  enantiomers were
metabolized differently. although initial studies in 1986 recognized that  xxxd2884xxx  (–)

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 1, 2007

86

h. ashrafian et al.

enantiomer was more rapidly metabolized, the enzymatic system subserving this role was
not known (gould et al. 1986). although the precise details are beyond the scope of this
review, in vitro assessment of  xxxd2884xxx  metabolism reveals that  xxxd2884xxx  clearance of
(+) and (–) enantiomers was 1376 vs. 2475, 230 vs. 482, and 63.4 vs. 54.6 µ/min/mg for
the ems, ims, and pms, respectively. interestingly, cyp2d6 only catalyses the formation
of cis-oh-(+)- xxxd2884xxx , trans1-oh-(+)- xxxd2884xxx  and cis-oh-(–)- xxxd2884xxx . these
represent the predominant pathways of metabolism in the majority of the population. however, in the absence of cyp2d6 in pms,  xxxg583xxx  and cyp3a4 each catalyze the trans-1and trans-2-4-monohydroxylation of both (+)- and (–)-phx with low affinity. this explains
the different stereoselective metabolism patterns identified in pms vs. ems.
in summary, it is apparent that the initial complications of  xxxd2884xxx  principally derived
from the accumulation of the native compound in pms. this accumulation occurred due
to a deficiency in the cyp2d6 enzymatic pathway. appreciating that this pathway has the
dual implications of a better understanding of the detailed  xxxd2884xxx  metabolic pathway
and the potential for pharmacogenetics to both guide our understanding of drug toxicity
and to avoid these side effects.

toxicity (table 2)
depending on the manner and rate of  xxxd2884xxx  administration, the incidence of adverse
events with  xxxd2884xxx  can vary between 0% and 60% (killalea and krum, 2001). there
is a clear delineation between minor and serious major toxic effects; serious toxicity takes
at least 3 months to develop. the most reliable evidence suggests that the incidence of
early adverse effects ranges from 10% to 28%, even in patients who are subject to a fastloading regimen (philpott et al. 2004). bearing in mind that  xxxd2884xxx  exists only in an
oral formulation, the vast majority of these adverse events is related to rapid oral loading
and has been recognized to occur due to high  xxxd2884xxx  concentrations, usually in pms
or in patients with marked saturation of metabolism. nonetheless, transient minor adverse
events represent the majority of these side effects.
the minor transient effects predominantly are dizziness, headache, and nausea. other
recorded events include vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, lethargy, insomnia, and loss of libido.
these adverse events abate spontaneously or respond well to drug dose reduction as will
be discussed in detail below. in general, these side effects do not result in drug discontinuation (killalea and krum, 2001). the decline in  xxxd2884xxx ’s use, however, resulted
from a small number of case reports (abaza et al. 1973) of severe debilitating neuropathy
(laplane and bousser, 1981), papilloedema, and potentially fatal hepatotoxicity (paliard
et al. 1978; poupon et al. 1980; shah et al. 1999) in those on long-term  xxxd2884xxx  therapy.

other reported adverse reports that may have been associated with  xxxd2884xxx -induced
hypoglycemia (dally et al. 1977), weight loss (myers and ronthal, 1978), and renal impairment. although these more serious adverse events were initially reported as case reports,
by august 1983, 80 cases of hepatotoxicity and 131 cases of neuropathy had been reported
in the united kingdom (shah, 2006). this was mirrored by reports from new zealand
suggesting that between 1974 and 1994, 46 cases of hepatic adverse events were reported
due to  xxxd2884xxx  (although as will be seen, despite continued more limited use, all but one
of these cases occurred before 1988 when plasma monitoring was adopted) (pillans, 1996).
these events constituted between 4.6% and 8.9% of all serious adverse hepatic events before the monitoring era in new zealand and france, respectively (killalea and krum, 2001;
pillans, 1996). despite these potentially serious side effects, a large observational series
of cardiac patients treated with  xxxd2884xxx  over a 10-month period in 1973 concluded that
the incidence of adverse events was low and that the annualized mortality rate of 4.25%
was comparable to that of a general cohort of patients with coronary artery disease. no
correlation could be established between  xxxd2884xxx  use and increased mortality in this
cohort (killalea and krum, 2001).
based on an increasingly comprehensive understanding of  xxxd2884xxx ’s metabolism
by the polymorphic cyp2d6 pathway predominantly in the liver, it is now appreciated
that the basis of the serious side effects relates to rapidly saturable and hence inadequate
metabolism of  xxxd2884xxx  in pms. indeed clues to this effect were apparent from the observation that although in normal patients,  xxxd2884xxx ’s elimination half-life was between
3 and 12 days, in pms this half-life could be as long 30 days (wright et al. 1973). although the targets for the accumulated plasma  xxxd2884xxx  levels were not known in the
1970s and 1980s, it became readily apparent that  xxxd2884xxx  rapidly accumulated at high
concentrations within the mitochondria. it was observed that as an amphiphilic (or amphipathic) molecule, protonated  xxxd2884xxx  accumulated in mitochondria along the mitochondrial membrane potential (deschamps et al. 1994). although at high concentrations,
a multitude of effects on mitochondria could be discerned, including the uncoupling of
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, inhibition of complexes i and ii, and decreased
atp formation, the most striking and clinically pertinent effect was reduced mitochondrial
beta-oxidation of long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  (deschamps et al. 1994; fromenty and pessayre, 1995).
in retrospect, based on our appreciation of the role of  xxxd2884xxx  as a powerful competitive
cpt-1 inhibitor, these effects become more explicable. parenthetically, it is notable that
 xxxd2154xxx  do not utilize cpt-1 to gain access to the mitochondria and their
metabolism is relatively unimpeded by  xxxd2884xxx  and other cpt-1 inhibitors at clinically
pertinent plasma  xxxd2884xxx  levels.
we speculate that the adverse reactions encountered with  xxxd2884xxx  and indeed those of
other cpt-1 inhibitors (e.g., etomoxir; rupp et al. 2006) are the consequence of excessive
cpt-1 and hence fatty acid metabolism inhibition. therefore, although a moderate inhibition of fatty acid metabolism is beneficial from the perspective of improved myocardial
efficiency, it has already been established that  xxxd2154xxx  are the myocardium’s primary
energy source. profound inhibition of myocardial energy provision by complete abrogation
of fatty acid metabolism, which may not be compensated for by carbohydrate metabolism,
may be detrimental. this is borne out in both experimental animal models and human inherited cardiomyopathies, where profound impairment of fatty acid metabolism results in
cardiomyopathy.  xxxg1805xxx  ( xxxg1805xxx ) has been knocked
out to test this hypothesis. downregulation of cardiac  xxxg1805xxx  leads to decreased fatty acid

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 1, 2007

88

h. ashrafian et al.

oxidation and increased reliance on carbohydrates. although at rest  xxxg1805xxx -deficient animal exhibits “normal” cardiac function, inadequate fatty acid metabolism at high workload
proves limiting. this limitation can, however, be mitigated by genetically augmenting carbohydrate metabolism by upregulating glut1—one of the glucose transporters (luptak et al.
2005). in short, although moderate fatty acid inhibition will increase myocardial efficiency
and yet leave enough fatty acid metabolism to ensure enough absolute energy provision,
excessive inhibition of fatty acid metabolism may prove detrimental.
additionally, excessive cpt-1 inhibition will lead to excessive upstream cytoplasmic
accumulation of  xxxd2154xxx  and their derivatives and decreased downstream derivatives
(e.g., ketone bodies). finally, excessive cpt-1 inhibition leads to excessive reliance on
carbohydrate utilization. this excessive carbohydrate removal from the plasma coupled with
the impact of excessive pancreatic beta-islet cell cytoplasmic fatty acid accumulation leading
to diacylglycerol synthesis and subsequent pkc-dependent insulin exocytosis, explains the
hypoglycemia identified as an adverse effect in  xxxd2884xxx  toxicity (lehtihet et al. 2003).
accordingly, in order to assess the structural correlates of these biochemical effects of
excess  xxxd2884xxx , intensive ultrastructural studies with electron microscopy and histoenzymological techniques were employed in cultured cells. these studies agreed with
clinical samples that demonstrated a pathology termed as pseudo-alcoholic hepatitis.
the changes identified were similar to those seen in alcoholic liver injury and included
macrovesicular as well as microvesicular steatosis, ballooning of hepatocytes (a feature of
injured hepatocytes), and mallory bodies. most importantly, characteristic lamellar lysosomal inclusion bodies representing phospholipidosis as well as triglyceride and fatty acid
accumulation were identified (lageron et al. 1981). this fits well with our biochemical
arguments.
in order to avoid these biochemical and histological changes characteristic of  xxxd2884xxx 
excess found in a number of tissues (e.g., peripheral nerve schwann cells) and incidentally
also a feature of amiodarone toxicity (another cpt-1 inhibitor), based on the preceding
pharmacokinetic arguments, it was recognized that dose adjustment should be made. explicitly, it was hypothesized that in order to avoid fatty acid, phospholipid, and ganglioside
(gm1 and gm4) accumulation as well as the other biochemical changes, systemic and
hence local  xxxd2884xxx  levels would need to be carefully regulated in pms. this hypothesis
was carefully confirmed by numerous compelling studies with the advent of an effective
 xxxd2884xxx  monitoring assay. singlas et al. (1978a, 1978b) noted that in three individuals
(2 male and 1 female) who had regularly used  xxxd2884xxx  maleate for at least 5 months
and had severe neurological side effects, that the plasma levels of the drug were chronically
high ranging from approximately 5000 µg/l to 6500 µg/l. even without being familiar
with the role of cyp2d6 in  xxxd2884xxx ’s metabolism, the same group showed that those
with neuropathy had higher plasma levels of  xxxd2884xxx , with slower hepatic metabolism
and longer plasma half-lives. they showed that those with major neurological side effects
had a  xxxd2884xxx -to-metabolite ratio of 2.82 vs. 0.3 in those without neuropathy (singlas
et al. 1978, 1978b).
although the results of these studies were compelling, the biggest contribution to our understanding of how to mitigate the toxic side effects of  xxxd2884xxx  has come from the studies
of horowitz et al. over a mean study period of approximately 9 months they adjusted the
dose of  xxxd2884xxx  in 19 patients according to the clinical emergence or otherwise of neuroor hepatotoxicity. they recognized that patients developing hepatic or neurological side effects had plasma  xxxd2884xxx  concentrations of between 720 µg/l and 2680 µg/l on doses

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 1, 2007

 xxxd2884xxx 

89

of  xxxd2884xxx  ranging from 50 mg/day to 400 mg/day. horowitz et al. then carefully adjusted
 xxxd2884xxx  dosing in a cohort of subsequently treated patients to ensure that all patients had
steady-state plasma  xxxd2884xxx  concentrations of <600 µg/l. despite the fact that almost
all the patients had a reduction or complete resolution in their symptoms of angina with a
mean dose of approximately 160 mg/day (mean plasma  xxxd2884xxx  concentration of approximately 390 µg/l), none had any significant adverse events. these studies have transpired
to be of immense importance, as they have confirmed that long-term  xxxd2884xxx  dosing, if
guided by plasma monitoring, can be entirely safe without abolition of antianginal effects
(see appendix) (horowitz et al. 1986). support for this finding comes from the observation
that virtually all of  xxxd2884xxx ’s adverse effects have been avoided in patients who have been
treated with  xxxd2884xxx  for decades in australia and new zealand (horowitz et al. 1995).
furthermore, it emerged from observations of patients treated for acute coronary syndromes
that the less important “short-term” toxic effects of  xxxd2884xxx  (nausea/dizziness) are also
closely related to elevation of plasma  xxxd2884xxx  concentrations beyond 600 µg/l.
a number of further studies have subsequently formally confirmed these observations
(cole et al. 1990; pilcher et al. 1985; stewart et al. 1996). it is, however, important to note
that despite a well-validated protocol to load  xxxd2884xxx  in a gradual way that avoids early
side effects and permits adequate time for effective plasma monitoring and the mitigation of
any long-term side effects, a number of provisos exist. the first is that a fast-loading regimen
exists: while the majority of patients starting on  xxxd2884xxx  have a chronic disease with a low
imperative for rapid drug loading,  xxxd2884xxx  has been used successfully in acute coronary
syndromes with fast loading (philpott et al. 2004). this fast loading may incur potential side
effects. second, it is important to note that it is likely that in patients with liver impairment
due to other causes,  xxxd2884xxx  metabolism may be impaired; this is, however, less pertinent
to cyp2d6. finally, and most importantly,  xxxd2884xxx  has a number of drug interactions.
because  xxxd2884xxx  is metabolized by the p450 cyp2d6 microsomal enzymes, careful
attention should be paid to patients who are taking medications that interfere with this
enzyme system. the most notable group of agents are the ssris (e.g., fluoxetine and
paroxetine) (alderman et al. 1997). taking these factors into account, there is a mandate
for careful consideration of a patient’s liver function and coadministered drugs. plasma
monitoring and careful dosing are an effective guide to safe  xxxd2884xxx  administration,
even in those patients who require fast loading.
parenthetically, there is also an interesting additional feature of perhexilin metabolism
that has received little attention. it is apparent from the data already described that cyp2d6
phenotype (as determined by  xxxd1818xxx  metabolism patterns) is predictive of perhexilineinduced adverse events. in particular, the test has a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity
of approximately 50% (shah et al. 1982). stated alternatively, this implies that not every
pm even with high  xxxd2884xxx  concentrations has adverse effects. this has been confirmed
as part of the study looking at the interaction of ssris and  xxxd2884xxx ; despite a plasma
concentration of 1560 µg/l, one of the patients was asymptomatic (alderman et al. 1997).
although this may simply be attributed to an inadequate time for  xxxd2884xxx  to manifest
its side effects, they may also be good biological reasons for  xxxd2884xxx ’s lack of side
effects in these patients. there may also be other genetic or environmental determinants
of  xxxd2884xxx -induced organ damage. for example, polymorphisms in cpt-1 might render
 xxxd2884xxx  less potent in some patients in relation to others. these variations have not been
previously considered and may have a bearing on the identification of patients who are
specifically at risk.

pharmacogenetics
based on the work of horowitz and colleagues,  xxxd2884xxx  is being used relatively
extensively in australia and new zealand with appropriate plasma monitoring and dose
adjustment. due to the large variability in  xxxd2884xxx ’s elimination, even within groups
of extensive or poor metabolizers, some have suggested that dose adjustment may prove
arduous. although this has not been the case in our experience, approaches have nevertheless been devised to rapidly identify pms. for example, the use of the metabolic ratio of
 xxxd2884xxx  to monohydroxyperhexiline has been proposed as a rapid diagnostic tool. this
allows the discrimination of ums, ems, and pms and provides an indication of final dosing
requirement.
in order to further streamline the process of therapeutic monitoring, much hope exists on
the pharmacogenetic approaches (gardiner and begg, 2006). although pharmacogenetics
has not yet fulfilled the potential that was expected of it in a number of circumstances, in the
case of  xxxd2884xxx , it promises significant potential.  xxxd2884xxx  is effectively metabolized
by only one system (cyp2d6). as noted previously, this system has been well worked out
and conforms to well-recognized genetic principles. polymorphisms in the various alleles
can maintain, reduce, abolish, or rarely even enhance enzymatic activity. individuals with
two “normal” alleles are considered ems. those with two poorly functioning alleles are
considered pms. those with only one functional variant are termed intermediate metabolizers (ims); in practice these individuals generally function as ems although they may
be more susceptible to being seen as phenocopies (individuals who appear to have a given
phenotype associated with a given genetic profile, without having that genotype). this
would be achieved, for example, by patients taking a drug that interferes with  xxxd2884xxx 
metabolism; this would convert a genetic im to a phenotypically pm. apart from being an
ideal system from a genetic perspective, the impact of genetic polymorphisms is profound,
 xxxd2884xxx  has a relatively low therapeutic index and as already understood, there is a clear
relationship between dose and side effects. although a more detailed genetic analysis of the
cyp2d6 system is beyond the scope of this article, based on first principles,  xxxd2884xxx 
metabolism a priori is a good model system that should be amenable to pharmacogenetic
analysis.
accordingly, preliminary studies have been performed to assess whether clinical pharmacogenetic practice with  xxxd2884xxx  conforms to a priori expectation. seventy-four patients
who had been stabilized on  xxxd2884xxx  for >3 months were enrolled into a dual program
of assessment for metabolic ratio and cyp2d6 genotyping. in fact the genotyping was by
necessity limited to 11-point mutations known to occur in pms, 3-point mutations known
to occur in ims; the remaining 3 pms predisposing mutations involved large rearrangement in the gene-encoding cyp2d6 and were identified using polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) and southern blotting. one allele found in ums was also assessed using pcr. the
genetics corrected predicted all three true pms. two other phenocopies of pms were in fact
genetically ims, but were on medications that interfered with the cyp2d6 system. this
phenomenon emphasizes how genotypically im or even em patients can be chemically
(pharmacologically) converted to pms and should be vigilantly assessed. even within the
em range, the genetics were highly predictive of the precise phenotype. this study was
highly successful and suggested that genotyping was capable of identifying pms, that the
broad dose of these individuals could be predicted, but that therapeutic monitoring was
not obviated (barclay et al. 2003). a more detailed analysis of patients taking  xxxd2884xxx 

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 1, 2007

 xxxd2884xxx 

91

further confirmed the capacity of genotyping to predict those ims who are susceptible to
being rendered pms phenocopies and to identify pm (davies et al. 2006a, 2006b).
there is a strong case to be made for genotyping of patients due to receive  xxxd2884xxx .
not only has this been confirmed in an analysis of all drugs amenable to pharmacogenetics where  xxxd2884xxx  appeared close to the top of the list of potential drugs for which
genetic testing may be useful (gardiner and begg, 2006), but also in a recent analysis of
“[whether] pharmacogenetics help rescue drugs withdrawn from the market?”  xxxd2884xxx 
was considered as a model example (shah, 2006). how should genotyping be applied to
 xxxd2884xxx ?
most importantly, we propose that plasma monitoring should not be obviated by the
provision of a genetic test. genotyping of patients, if readily available at a reasonable
price would certainly identify pms and those at risk of being pm phenocopies. this would
have to be performed in an ethnically informed manner. depending on the intentions of
the clinicians involved and patient consent, the simplest strategy would be to avoid using
 xxxd2884xxx  in these pms altogether. an alternative strategy would be to treat these patients
with  xxxd2884xxx  but to be especially vigilant in their case. all patients should proceed to a
conventional loading regimen with plasma therapeutic monitoring. depending on who was
excluded on the original genotype data, the genotype could alert the physician to pms or
ims who were at higher risk of appearing as pms by agents that interfered with cyp2d6.
this coupled with software packages that are increasingly being used (or alert pharmacists)
that identify potentially detrimental drug interactions will prove an effective barrier to side
effects. although patients may be successfully and safely stabilized on  xxxd2884xxx , the
introduction of offending coadministered agents should be addressed by a check plasma
monitoring or perhaps infrequent serial monitoring as a routine. this could be performed at
the time of clinic review or other drug monitoring (e.g., potassium check for spironolactone)
for convenience.

clinical findings
as already mentioned,  xxxd2884xxx  is a highly potent antianginal agent. in this section, we
will review  xxxd2884xxx ’s mode of action and describe the benefits that have been observed
when it has been applied clinically. the normal heart relies predominantly on fatty acid
oxidation (>70%) with the remaining metabolic substrate subsisting of a host of different
metabolites including ketone bodies, carbohydrates, and other smaller contributions. the
precise contribution of metabolites will depend on the individual, the pathological state of
the heart, the systemic disease status, and even the timing of the previous meal—under the
influence of insulin the heart will metabolize carbohydrates immediately after a meal. as
already noted, free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffas) are an excellent source of fuel due to their impressive
enthalpy of combustion; however, they are also inefficient fuels by virtue of their impact
on oxygen utilization and expression of uncoupling proteins mediated through increased
 xxxg1805xxx  expression. a variety of faois exist including the cpt inhibitors ( xxxd2884xxx ,
oxfenicine, and etomoxir) and other potentially weaker agents that operate downstream
(e.g.,  xxxd3437xxx  and  xxxd3083xxx ), which can inhibit ffa metabolism and hence may
improve cardiac oxygen status or energetics (fig. 3). etomoxir and oxfenicine, despite
initial promise, suffered clinical complications and have been essentially abandoned (rupp

cardiovascular drug reviews, vol. 25, no. 1, 2007

92

h. ashrafian et al.

et al. 2006); however,  xxxd2884xxx  continues to boast significant clinical promise. based
on these analyses, conditions of cardiac oxygen deficiency (e.g., ischemic heart disease or
aortic stenosis) or energy deficiency (heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the
diabetic heart) would be predicted.

ischemic heart disease
even before its mechanism of action began to be appreciated,  xxxd2884xxx  was already
available clinically for the treatment of ischemic heart disease as manifested by angina
pectoris. as well as its prominent oxygen-sparing metabolic effect, there is probably a
contribution from  xxxd2884xxx ’s other pleotropic effects including coronary vasodilation
and cgmp augmentation. in a systematic review of 26 randomized, double-blind, controlled
trials including 696 patients,  xxxd2884xxx  was found to be remarkably potent. although all
but one of the trials were of cross-over design (with the attendant difficulty of washout time),
 xxxd2884xxx  provided at least a 50% reduction in  xxxd1914xxx  symptoms over use of nitroglycerin.
this was supported by 11 of 13 positive trials employing objective electrocardiographic
measures of ischemia. not only was  xxxd2884xxx ’s effect antianginal in its own right, but
 xxxd2884xxx  also compared favorably with use of beta-blockers (killalea and krum, 2001).
in addition to being excellent in chronic stable angina, in which it is used safely and with
great efficacy (especially angina refractory to other medical and interventional therapies)
(horowitz et al. 1995),  xxxd2884xxx  is also an effective therapy in acute coronary syndromes.
once again, australia and new zealand have pioneered this application (willoughby et al.
2002).

aortic stenosis
extensive evidence has been available for decades that severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
without aortic valve replacement carries a bleak prognosis. despite advances in the application of medical and minimally invasive therapies to many areas of cardiology, surgery
remains the gold standard for severe aortic stenosis. nevertheless, by virtue of aortic stenosis being a condition of the elderly, cardiac surgery in these patients often with extensive
comorbidity is not without hazard and is on occasion contraindicated. because aortic stenosis is characterized by a decreased perfusion pressure to an increasingly hypertrophied
ventricle, a state of relative oxygen debt may exist. more recently, aortic stenosis, irrespective of the presence of coronary disease, has been shown to be associated with platelet
hyperaggregability and hyporesponsiveness to antiaggregatory effects of no donor sodium
nitroprusside (snp) (chirkov et al. 2002).  xxxd2884xxx ’s capacity to ameliorate oxygen debt
metabolically, improve coronary perfusion, and to improve reduction platelet aggregation
might accordingly be considered of utility. a preliminary study reported that in 13 of 15
elderly patients (age range 73–87 years) with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, who were
unsuitable for aortic valve replacement based on conventional criteria and who were treated
with  xxxd2884xxx  and followed up for 30 months, symptoms improved. twelve-month actuarial survival was 80%. thus  xxxd2884xxx  is well tolerated in this group (bearing in mind
the proviso of therapeutic plasma monitoring); it was certainly associated with a marked
clinical improvement in clinical status in this group of elderly patients and may even confer

 xxxd2884xxx 

93

prognostic benefits (unger et al. 1997). this pilot study has ceded to a complete randomized,
double-blinded, controlled trial the results of which are soon to be announced.

heart failure
despite significant progress in the medical treatment of heart failure, morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. thus a significant unmet gap exists between ideal medical
therapy and that which is available. although neurohormonal antagonistic therapy has essentially been fully applied, with significant success, few novel therapeutic avenues exist. it
has, however, been known for some time that chronic heart failure is characterized by complex and deranged substrate metabolism (stanley et al. 2005). these impairments are known
to translate into myocardial energetic deficiency (ingwall and weiss, 2004). although some
controversy exists, both animal models and human studies suggest that in moderate heart
failure, ffa metabolism is maintained or increased (horowitz and kennedy, 2006; stanley
et al. 2005). heart failure is also characterized by insulin resistance (dutka et al. 2006).
metabolic therapy for heart failure is thus a highly promising prospect. although small
preliminary studies with etomoxir were promising, more systematic clinical studies were
discontinued due to side effects (rupp et al. 2006). in contrast, studies with  xxxd2884xxx  have
been very encouraging. studies done by members of our own group in a randomized, doubleblind, and placebo-controlled fashion, assessed the effect of  xxxd2884xxx  on patients with
optimally medicated congestive heart failure. patients were randomized to either  xxxd2884xxx 
(n = 28) or placebo (n = 28). treatment with  xxxd2884xxx  led to significant improvements
in vo 2max (16.1 ± 0.6 to 18.8 ± 1.1 ml/kg/min; p < 0.001), which are unprecedented
in comparison with other medical therapies. this is remarkable bearing in mind that these
patients are already well medicated. quality of life improved (minnesota score reduction
from 45 ± 5 to 34 ± 5; p = 0.04), and perhaps more notably, the well-understood and commonly clinically used parameter of left ventricular ejection fraction improved dramatically
(24% ± 1% to 34% ± 2%; p < 0.001).  xxxd2884xxx  represents, therefore, a novel and
promising treatment for congestive heart failure. if the precautions described earlier are
carefully employed,  xxxd2884xxx  can be efficacious, tolerable, and safe.
because metabolic and energetic dysfunction characterize other cardiac disorders such
as the diabetic heart (an and rodrigues, 2006; scheuermann-freestone et al. 2003) and
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (crilley et al. 2003), these conditions may also benefit from
 xxxd2884xxx . although no formal trials have been published, anecdotal evidence suggests
that  xxxd2884xxx  is also highly effective for these conditions and there have been calls for
formal trials to assess its efficacy in such contexts (horowitz and kennedy, 2006).

conclusions
 xxxd2884xxx  is one of the original metabolic pharmaceutical agents. it has proved to be
highly efficacious in many different cardiac contexts where newer therapies have failed.
we suspect that as a result of pharmacological serendipity, when correctly applied and
monitored,  xxxd2884xxx  will again prove to be a great value in cardiovascular medicine. its
renaissance has already been ushered in by advances in monitoring therapy and our improved
understanding of the metabolic deficiencies in cardiac conditions.  xxxd2884xxx ’s return to

the armamentarium of pharmacology will need to be accompanied by greater thought and
application with respect to the clinical pharmacology, basic biology, and pharmacogenetics
of this agent. ultimately, if these commitments are made and support is forthcoming from
both industry and the regulators to drive  xxxd2884xxx  into phase iii studies, there is a significant probability that  xxxd2884xxx  will find use in a variety of unpleasant and life-shortening
conditions.

appendix— xxxd2884xxx  dosing
an effective and safe protocol with which to dose  xxxd2884xxx  in patients is to start with
100 mg b.i.d. this should be initiated after appropriate baseline general medical assessment
(including liver function tests), an assessment of coadministered medications, and patient
counseling. plasma levels should be obtained at 1, 4, and 8 weeks after initiation of the drug
for measurements of serum  xxxd2884xxx  levels, with subsequent dose titration to prevent
toxicity or to ensure that  xxxd2884xxx  levels are in the therapeutic range (lee et al. 2004).
