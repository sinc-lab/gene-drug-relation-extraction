a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation trial of merimepodib (vx-497) and interferon-alpha in previously untreated patients ...  inhibition of  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase (impdh) is one of several proposed mechanisms of action for ribavirin ( xxxd3111xxx ), a critical component of the current treatment for chronic hepatitis c (chc). this study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study of a novel, selective, orally active small molecule inhibitor of impdh, merimepodib (vx-497 or mmpd) in combination with standard interferon-alpha ( xxxg1137xxx ). fifty-four treatment-naive patients with genotype-1 chc were randomized to receive  xxxg1137xxx  3 miu subcutaneously three times a week, alone or in combination with 100 mg or 300 mg (every 8 h) of mmpd for 4 weeks. at the end of 4 weeks, all patients were offered 48 weeks of treatment with  xxxg1137xxx / xxxd3111xxx . the objectives of the study were to evaluate the tolerability of the  xxxg1137xxx /mmpd combination and to evaluate whether mmpd had an on-treatment effect on hcv-rna, similar to  xxxd3111xxx  when added to  xxxg1137xxx . the drug combination was generally well tolerated; one patient at the higher dose discontinued because of elevated  xxxg941xxx  levels. no pharmacokinetic interactions were evident between the two drugs. analysis of covariance that adjusted for a baseline imbalance in hcv-rna in the intent-to-treat population did not show any significant differences between the treatment groups, or between mmpd plus  xxxg1137xxx  compared with  xxxg1137xxx  alone. however, the per-protocol primary efficacy analysis based on treatment-compliant patients demonstrated a greater reduction in mean hcv-rna in the combination of 100 mg mmpd plus  xxxg1137xxx  compared with  xxxg1137xxx  alone (-1.78 log vs -0.86 log, p=0.037). in conclusion, the addition of a selective impdh inhibitor to  xxxg1137xxx  was well tolerated. in a low-dose range, the addition of mmpd may have the potential to add to the antiviral efficacy of  xxxg1137xxx . larger, longer duration trials incorporating pegylated ifn would be required to determine whether this combination, alone or with  xxxd3111xxx , would increase either early or sustained virological response rates.
