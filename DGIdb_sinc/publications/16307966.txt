abstract
objectives: to evaluate the possible role of tamoxifen (selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators, serm) in treating bleeding irregularities
associated with norplant contraceptive use.
material and methods: randomized clinical trial including 100 norplant users complaining of vaginal bleeding irregularities. the trial was
conducted in the family planning clinic of assiut university hospital. women were assigned at random to receive tamoxifen tablets (10 mg)
twice daily for 10 days or similar placebo. women were followed-up for 3 months. the end points were percentage of women who stopped
bleeding during treatment, bleeding/spotting days during the period of follow-up, effect of treatment on their lifestyle, and side effects and
discontinuation of contraception.
results: there was good compliance with treatment. at the end of treatment, a significantly higher percentage of tamoxifen users stopped
bleeding in comparison to the control group (88% vs. 68%, respectively; p = .016). women who used tamoxifen had significantly less
bleeding and/or spotting days than women who used placebo, during the first and second months. during the third month, there were no
significant differences between the two groups. women who used tamoxifen reported improvement in performing household activities,
religious duties and in sexual life, during the first 2 months. in the third month, there were no differences between the two groups. there were
no significant differences between tamoxifen and placebo groups in reporting side effects. in the group who used tamoxifen, two women
discontinued norplant use because of bleeding vs. nine women in the placebo group.
conclusion: tamoxifen use at a dose of 10 mg twice daily orally, for 10 days, has a beneficial effect on vaginal bleeding associated with
norplant use. in addition, the bleeding pattern was better in women who used tamoxifen for the following 2 months after treatment. however,
these results have to be confirmed in a larger trial before advocating this line of treatment.

1. introduction
endometrial breakthrough bleeding (btb) problems,
and in particular irregular and prolonged bouts of bleeding,
are a major side effect of progestin-only contraceptives.
since progestogen-only contraceptives (pocs) represent
one of the safest, reversible, long-acting fertility control
methods available for many women, endometrial bleeding
problems must be considered a major clinical and social
problem [1]. there is no established treatment for this btb
and it commonly leads to discontinuation [2,3]. disturbed
bleeding patterns may reflect a change in the type of
endometrial vessel from which the bleeding arises (vessel

source), vessel integrity, hemostasis or a combination of
these factors [4]. grow and reece [5] have proposed that
endometrial btb results from the stimulatory effects of
estrogen in the endometrium. because pocs (especially
norplant) do not consistently inhibit ovulation like oral
contraceptives, the endogenous ovarian estradiol may
contribute to btb [5]. estrogen causes endometrial proliferation, hyperplasia and neoplasia if unopposed. estrogen
allows the production of growth factors supporting angiogenesis which results in an abundance of endometrial surface
blood vessels. these vessels are predisposed to bleed due to
the reduction in their vascular structural integrity secondary
to prolonged exposure to progestogens [4,6]. estrogen has
been linked to angiogenesis through estrogen-responsive
mitogens such as  xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg787xxx ) and
vascular endothelial growth factors (vegfs) which have

h. abdel-aleem et al. / contraception 72 (2005) 432 – 437

been demonstrated to be involved in the construction and
remodeling of new blood vessels of the endometrium [7,8].
inhibition of these estrogen-responsive mitogens could
facilitate endometrial vascular stability and thereby prevent
endometrial bleeding.
tamoxifen is a triphenylethylene derivative that is a
competitive antagonist of estrogen, but seems to have antiangiogenic effects independent of, and in addition to, its
anti-estrogen effects. tamoxifen enjoys widespread clinical
use for its ability to prevent the spread of breast cancer in
humans [5]. grow and reece [5] hypothesized that selective
 xxxg730xxx  modulators (serms) such as tamoxifen
may improve bleeding with pocs by antagonizing the
angiogenic effect of estrogen. although this effect has been
demonstrated in nonhuman primates [9,10], to the best of
our knowledge, it has not been tested in humans.
therefore, we planned this randomized controlled trial
to test the possible role of tamoxifen in treating uterine
bleeding irregularities associated with norplant contraceptive use.
2. material and methods
this double-blinded randomized controlled trial was
conducted during the period between march 2003 and
august 2004, in the family planning clinic of the
department of obstetrics and gynecology, assiut university hospital, assiut, egypt.
2.1. participants
one hundred women with current complaints of
increased bleeding during norplant use were the target
population of this trial. bleeding was defined as current
episode of bleeding/spotting z 8 days, or bleeding-free
interval b 15 days. all participants were in their first year of
norplant use who had accepted to participate in the trial and
to keep an accurate menstrual diary for the study.
2.2. exclusion criteria
women with any medical disease that may be affected by
the use of hormonal contraceptive methods, those with
uterine gynecological abnormality, lactating women and
women who had received treatment for uterine bleeding
within the past month were excluded from participation in
the study.
2.3. interventions
tamoxifen 10-mg tablets (medical union pharmaceutical, egypt) and identical placebo (especially prepared for
this trial in the department of pharmaceuticals, faculty of
pharmacy, assiut university, egypt) were used in the trial.
2.4. randomization
randomization was done using computer-generated
random table. women were assigned randomly to either

433

treatment (tamoxifen 10-mg tablets twice daily for 10 days)
or similar placebo. blinding was achieved using serialnumbered closed envelopes containing 20 tablets of either
the drug or the placebo. once an envelope was opened,
allocation could not be changed.
2.5. follow-up schedule
each participant was scheduled for four appointments: at
the end of the treatment (after 10 days), at the end of the
first month after treatment, at the end of the second month
after treatment and, finally, at the end of the third month
after treatment.
since women participating in the study were in a current
episode of bleeding for more than 8 days or bleeding-free
interval for less than 15 days, bleeding history was
ascertained by oral recall. patients enrolled were given a
menstrual diary to record bleeding/spotting days in the
3 months following the start of treatment. at the first followup, each woman was asked whether she had completed the
treatment or not and about the number of treatment days
required to stop the current episode of bleeding. if she did
not complete the treatment, she was asked about the reason
for discontinuation and the number of treatment days she
had taken the tablets. at each visit, each participant was
asked to report any change in the menstrual pattern
including number of bleeding and spotting days since the
last visit. oral recall was compared with what was recorded
in her menstrual diary to substantiate proper notations in the
diary. side effects that may have been related to drug intake,
flushes, dizziness, nausea and vomiting were also recorded.
discontinuations due to side effects were reported.
2.6. assessment of the effect of treatment on a woman’s
lifestyle
perceived effect of treatment on a woman’s life style was
assessed by a short validated interview questionnaire. the
questionnaire was first written in english and piloted on a
small group of women. this resulted in some modifications
to reach the final english version. after reaching this
version, linguistic validation was done using the methodology proposed by acquadro et al. [11] to reach the final
arabic version of the questionnaire. the questionnaire
included four questions proposed to all participants at the
recruitment visit and at each follow-up visit thereafter. each
woman was asked about feeling some improvement in
regard to performing her household duties, religious duties
(which may have been affected by btb), in sexual relation
with her husband and, finally, about her overall satisfaction
with the treatment she had received. women’s answers were
compared before and after treatment.
2.7. ethical aspects
the study was approved by the assiut university
medical review board, and all subjects signed an informed
consent prior to study enrolment.

2.8. data entry and analysis
all the above data were entered into a microsoft
access database and analyzed by spss statistical analysis
software. comparisons between the two groups were done
using independent sample t test to compare the mean
values between groups in scale variables. however, v 2 test
was used to compare the dichotomous variables in the
two groups.

sample size calculation was not done because this is the
first trial using tamoxifen for treating bleeding irregularities
associated with norplant. we recruited women fulfilling the
inclusion criteria and accepting to participate during an
18-month period.

3. results
the study included 100 women who were using norplant
for 3 to 12 months and were complaining of bleeding. the
trial profile is shown in fig. 1. two cases, one in the
tamoxifen and one in the placebo group, did not complete
the treatment, but they were included in the analysis (intentto-treat analysis). there were three cases lost to follow-up in
the tamoxifen group and two cases in the placebo group.

in the trial. there were no significant differences between
the two groups in any of the characteristics at admission.

t the difference is statistically significant (p v .05).

the percentage of women who stopped bleeding during
treatment is shown in table 2. a significantly higher
percentage of women in the tamoxifen group stopped
bleeding at 3, 7 and 10 days, in comparison to women in
the placebo group. at the end of treatment, 88% of
tamoxifen users stopped bleeding in comparison with 68%
in the control group. the difference is statistically significant (p= .016).
bleeding days, spotting days and total bleeding/spotting
days during the 3 months of the trial are depicted in table 3.
women who used tamoxifen had significantly less bleeding
and/or spotting days than women who used placebo, during
the first and second months. during the third month, there
were no significant differences between the two groups.
the beneficial effect of tamoxifen was reflected in the
improvement in the women’s lifestyle and overall satisfaction with treatment. a significantly higher percentage of
women were satisfied by the end of the first and second
months after treatment compared with the control group
(85.7% and 75.5% vs. 34.7 and 23.9%, respectively;
pb .0005). but in the third month, there was no difference
between those who received tamoxifen or placebo. moreover, by the end of the first and second months after
treatment, significantly higher percentages of tamoxifen
users expressed improvement in performing their household
activities, religious duties and in sexual life than in the
control group. while in the third month, there were no
differences between the two groups.
following treatment with tamoxifen, the subjects tended
to enjoy a long bleeding-free interval which lasted, on
average, 33.2f20.9 days; the corresponding figure in the
placebo-treated subjects was only 15.7f12.9 days

(p= .0003). the total number of bleeding and spotting
episodes in the 90-day reference period was, on average,
2.68f1.8 in the tamoxifen group and 4.63f2.17 in the
placebo group (p= .0002).
the side effects and discontinuation of norplant are
shown in table 4. there were no significant differences
between the tamoxifen and placebo groups in reporting side
effects. in the group who used tamoxifen, two women
discontinued norplant use because of bleeding. ten women
discontinued the use of norplant in the placebo group: nine
because of bleeding and one for planned pregnancy. no
pregnancies occurred during the period of the study.
4. discussion
this is the first trial, to our knowledge, reporting the use
of tamoxifen in the treatment of bleeding irregularities
associated with norplant use. tamoxifen treatment in the
present study was more effective than the placebo in
stopping a current episode of bleeding. it significantly
reduced the number of bleeding and spotting days in the first
2 months after the start of treatment. the beneficial effect of
tamoxifen was not limited to stoppage of an episode of
bleeding. the 90-day reference analysis following tamoxifen treatment exhibited significantly less episodes of
bleeding and longer bleeding-free interval relative to the
control. the beneficial effect of tamoxifen was reflected by
significantly higher proportions of women in the tamoxifen
group who were satisfied with treatment and who felt some
improvement in their lifestyle during the first and second
months after treatment relative to the control.
a series of clinical trials using different strategies for
management of btb accompanying norplant use have been
tried. this included the use of  xxxd2054xxx  [12–15],
combined oral contraceptives [13,16], ibuprofen [12],
 xxxd2556xxx  acid [17,18] and  xxxd3521xxx  [3,19]. the beneficial
effect of the above drugs in reducing the number of bleeding
and spotting days of a current bleeding episode in
comparison with the placebo was much varied. it ranged
from no effect in some studies [3,14] to about 25–30%
improvement in others [13,17,18]. even the beneficial
effects encountered in some of these trials were not
reproducible in larger trials [1–3].
tamoxifen treatment was also followed by prolonged
bleeding-free interval after treatment, significantly less
bleeding and spotting days, and less episodes of bleeding
relative to the control. however, previously tried manage-

436

h. abdel-aleem et al. / contraception 72 (2005) 432 – 437

ment strategies showed no satisfactory long-term effect for
these bleeding disturbances [1]. the above salutary effect of
tamoxifen must be confirmed by a larger randomized
controlled trial.
grow and reece [5] have suggested an explanation for
the above beneficial effect of serms. they based their
explanation upon the results of in vitro trials demonstrating
that endometrial aberrant revascularization may be estrogen-dependent rather than progestogen-dependent. antiprogesterones (noncompetitive anti-estrogens) theoretically
may have the capacity to inhibit the growth of these abnormal vessels by its estrogen antagonism properties. laboratory animals treated with mifepristone (anti-progesterone)
had significantly lower  xxxg787xxx  and vegf-r1 (estrogenresponsive mitogens) relative to the control animals [20].
moreover, williams et al. [21] showed that castrated
monkeys treated with noncompetitive estrogen antagonist
(onapristone) experienced a 10-fold reduction in the
incidence of btb relative to the placebo. we can propose
a similar mechanism for the effect of tamoxifen (competitive anti-estrogen). additionally, nonhuman primate trials
demonstrated the anti-angiogenic action of tamoxifen.
tamoxifen was capable of decreasing the number of blood
vessels in the nude mice carcinoma of the breast by 68%
[22]. tamoxifen and antiprogestins inhibit angiogenesis in
the chick egg chorio-allantoic membrane, and this antiangiogenic action is independent of  xxxg730xxx  action
[9]. this inhibition of angiogenesis was even observed
in the presence of fivefold increased concentrations of
17g-estradiol. this suggests anti-angiogenic action that is
independent of the  xxxg730xxx . the effects of tamoxifen have been demonstrated in the uteri of rats, where
treatment causes a decrease in uterine weight, epithelial
thickness and number of glands [10]. unfortunately, studies
on the effect of tamoxifen on human endometrial vasculature
are scarce in the scientific literature.
there are reports demonstrating that tamoxifen stimulates
proliferation of the endometrium and polypi formation if
used for a long time to prevent breast cancer [23,24]. the
relative risk was, however, predominantly in women over the
age of 50, who had a relative risk of 4.01; the relative risk for
women aged 49 or younger was 1.21 [23,24]. the previous
finding was also confirmed by the study of goldstein [25],
who found that the risk of endometrial carcinoma appears to
be confined to women over 50; in contrast, in women under
50 there was no statistically significant increased risk.
tamoxifen is a competitive anti-estrogen, and its precise
action sometimes depends on the presence of estrogen. in the
absence of estradiol, tamoxifen promotes some endometrial
growth, but in the presence of estradiol, growth is inhibited
[26]. in the present study, the average age of the women was
32 years, and tamoxifen was used for 10 days, thus the
abovementioned risk should not be considered.
the theoretical concern of the possible interference of
tamoxifen treatment with the efficacy of the contraceptive
implant cannot be ignored. although the present study was

not designed to answer this question, no case of pregnancy
was reported. tamoxifen has rarely been combined with
progestin. one report showed profound suppression of both
estrogen and progesterone receptors in the endometrium,
which was atrophic and decidualized [27].
in conclusion, tamoxifen could have a role in the
treatment of vaginal bleeding irregularities associated with
pocs. the improvement in bleeding pattern which lasted
for 2 months after treatment is also appealing. however,
these results have to be confirmed in a larger trial.
