hydrogels based on polymeric derivatives of  xxxd3159xxx  have been prepared for
biomedical applications by free radical copolymerization of 2-hydroxy-4-methacrylamidobenzoic acid, 4hma, and 2-hydroxy-5-methacrylamidobenzoic acid, 5hma, with 2hydroxyethylmethacrylate, hema, in a wide range of compositions. the reactivity ratios of
4hma and 5hma with hema in radical copolymerization processes have been determined
from their 1 h nmr spectra by applying linearization methods and non-linear least square
treatments. tgs of the corresponding copolymers were analyzed by dsc. the swelling
behavior in water of the prepared copolymers was studied in comparison to poly-(hema),
poly-(4hma) and poly-(5hma) hydration degrees, being in all cases superior to 35%. the
hydrolytical behavior of the synthesized copolymers was studied at three different phs (2, 7.4
and 10) determining the release percentage of the  xxxd3159xxx  derivatives, 4-amino salicylic
acid, 4asa, and 5-amino  xxxd3159xxx , 5asa, analyzed by high performance liquid
chromatography (hplc). the release analysis was followed during 230 days and a ph
dependence was observed obtaining the highest release percentages at ph Âˆ 10, whereas at
physiological ph (7.4) the release percentages were in range from 2 to 5% at that time for all
copolymer systems. the hydrolytical stability is enough for long-term applications like bone
cements, ionomers, etc.

1. introduction

2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) homopolymer
and copolymers have been widely used in applications
such as vascular grafts coating, vascular valves, vascular
prosthesis and contact lenses due to their capability of
forming biocompatible hydrogels with an excellent
tolerance and good biostability, as well as a great
bioadhesion [1Â±6].
the  xxxd3159xxx  derivatives 4- and 5-aminosalicylic
acids (4-asa and  xxxd2579xxx ) have been linked to several
types of polymers and applied as pharmacological agents
and anti-inÂ¯ammatory drugs [7Â±9]. we previously
reported the synthesis of the two methacrylic monomers
derived from  xxxd153xxx , 2-hydroxy-4-n-methacylamidobenzoic acid, 4hma, and 2-hydroxy-5-n
methacylamidobenzoic acid, 5hma[10] (see fig. 1),
which have been incorporated to acrylic bone cement
formulations [11] due to their ability to form molecular
complexes with calcium atoms [12] which can facilitate
bone regeneration in these types of applications. in this
sense, 5- hma was added to the liquid phase of classical
acrylic bone cement formulations with methyl metha0957Â±4530

crylate, mma, and with hema, showing excellent
curing parameters and a slightly higher hydration degree
than pmma formulations [13] also having the possibility
of behaving as a control release systems of the salicylic
acid side groups bonded to the macromolecular chains by
amide links.
in addition, due to the intrinsic pharamacological
activity of these compounds (they present pharmacological activity as macromolecules) hema derivatives
might be quite interesting in alternative applications as
hydrophilic coatings or hydrogel matrices. as it has been
demonstrated for analogous polymers bearing salicylic
acid or nsaids (non-steroidal anti-inÂ¯ammatory drugs),
hema copolymers not only act as drug carriers behaving
as drug delivery systems in which the drug can be released
in mild conditions by hydrolytical processes [13, 14] but
also offer the possibility of being pharmacologically
active in their macromolecular form [15].
the aim of this paper is the preparation of hema
derivatives bearing the mentioned compounds by
copolymerization reactions of 4hma and 5hma with
hema. the copolymerization reaction as well as the
535

elmer dsc-7 calorimeter. measurements and calibration
were carried out at a heating rate of 10  c min 1 . tg was
taken as the midpoint of the transition region. samples
(*40 mg weight) were introduced into the aluminum
pan, heated at 450 k. compressed and quenched at room
temperature before carrying out the measurements. tg
values determined at 5 and 15  c min 1 heating rates,
gave a deviation of 5 2% with respect to those obtained
 xxxd1891xxx   c min 1 .

aqueous behavior, chain Â¯exibility and hydrolytical
stability, have been characterized.

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials

the monomers 4hma and 5hma (see fig. 1) syntheses
have been described in a previous paper [12].
azobisisobutironitrile (aibn) (merck) was recrystallized from methanol (melting point 104  c). 2hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hema, was puriÂ®ed
according to the literature [16]. the solvents diethyl
ether (quimicen), methanol (quimicen) and dimethylformamide, dmf, (scharlau) were puriÂ®ed by standard
procedures.

2.2. copolymerization

all copolymerization reactions were carried out in dmf
solutions at 50+0:1 c in pyrex glass ampoules sealed
under high vacuum. the monomer and initiator
concentration were 1.0 and 1:5610 2 mol l 1 ,
respectively. the sealed ampoules were vigorously
shaken and immersed into a water bath regulated at the
polymerization temperature. after reaction, the copolymers were precipitated into a large excess of diethyl
ether, washed with water and dried under vacuum until
constant weight was attained.

2.3. characterization

the copolymers obtained from different mixtures of
4hma and 5hma with hema, were analyzed by 1 h
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) with a
varian xlr-300 operating at 300 mhz. the spectra
were recorded on 5% (w/v) deuterated methanol
solutions (cd3 od).

2.4. differential scanning calommetry (dsc)
analysis

the tg values of the corresponding homopolymers and
prepared copolymers were determinated with a perkin536

films of 0.4Â±0.5 thickness were prepared by slow
evaporation of a solution of 0.5g of the copolymer
samples in 5 ml of dmf/methanol (1 : 1). copolymers
prepared with 10 and 20% wt of 4hma and 5hma were
used. in order to obtain homogeneous discs, a cylindrical
mold of teÂ¯on (20 mm diameter and 8 mm depth) was
prepared. after evaporation and drying at reduced
pressure, transparent and clear Â®lms were obtained.
homopolymers poly (4hma) and poly (5hma) Â®lms
were also prepared to carry out comparative studies.
the study of the hydration degree of Â®lms was
followed gravimetrically by measuring the weight with
the time of immersion in 10 ml of distilled water at 37  c.
measurements were taken until the equilibrium was
reached, which was considered to be when three
consecutive measurements gave the same value.

2.6. hydrolytical behavior

the hydrolytical study of the homopolymers poly
(4hma), poly (5hma), and the prepared copolymers,
was carried out over a period of 230 days in buffer
solutions of ph Âˆ 2, 7.4 and 10, analyzing the 4-asa and
 xxxd2579xxx  release by high performance liquid chromotography (hplc). the hplc eluent was constituted by a
buffer solution ( ph Âˆ 7.8) of kh2 po4 (0.067 m)/
acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran, thf, (85/10/5), using a
bio-rad bio-sil c18 hl 90Â±5 column connected to
a perkin-elmer lc 250 pump, a uv/vis detector perkinelmer lcÂ±95 and to a computer where the chromatograms were registered. the uv spectra gave maximum
absorbance at 265 and 332 nm for the 4-asa and  xxxd2579xxx 
solutions, respectively. six standard solutions of 4-asa
and  xxxd2579xxx  of known concentration between 750Â±25 mm
were prepared to obtain the corresponding calibration
lines. solutions were injected onto the column using a
1 ml/min Â¯ow. on the other hand, the buffer solutions
were prepared from hcl and glycine ( ph Âˆ 2), kh2 po4
and na2 hpo4 ( ph Âˆ 7.4) and naoh and glycine
( ph Âˆ 10). 50 mg of the corresponding homopolymers
and copolymers were added to 125 ml of each buffer
solution. one ml samples were taken from each buffer at
different times, precipitating the corresponding polymers
by adding 0.4 ml of hcl 0.5 m , and analyzing the 4-asa
and  xxxd2579xxx  solutions by adding the column eluent (1/1).

3. results and discussion

the 4hma-hema and 5hma-hema copolymers
were prepared by radical copolymerization reactions as
described in the experimental section. the presence of

the polar carboxylic, phenolic (4hma and 5hma) and
hydroxyl (hema) groups, together with the rigid
character of the aromatic ring (4hma and 5hma) or
the Â¯exible oxyethylene residue (hema), impart to the
material some particular properties as we will discuss
later, specially those related with the behavior in aqueous
media. the global Â¯exibility as well as the polar
interactions between the different units (4hma-4hma,
hema-hema, etc) determine most of the characteristics of the hydrogel matrix. in this sense, a deep study
of the copolymerization reactions, and mainly the
knowledge of the sequence distribution, will be very
helpful. therefore, we have determined the reactivity
ratios for both copolymerization reactions.
copolymers at low conversion were prepared with
molar fractions in the monomer feed, f4hma and f5hma ,
from 0.20 to 0.80 as shown in table i. the reaction time
was initially regulated to reach conversions of 4 5 wt %
in order to satisfy the differential copolymerization
equation [17]. the molar fraction of monomer units in
the copolymer chains was determined from the 1 h nmr
spectra of the copolymer samples prepared with different
monomer feed. the analysis was carried out by
comparison of the integrated intensities of resonance
signals with chemical shifts assigned to the aromatic
protons (6.6Â±8.1 ppm) of monomers 4hma and 5hma,
and from the signals with chemical shifts 3.7 ppm
and 4.0 ppm corresponding to the -ch2 oh and -o-ch2 hema groups as can be observed in fig. 2 for the
4hma-hema system.
the reactivity ratios of the monomers were determined
according to the general copolymerization equation by
application of the linearization methods proposed by
fineman and ross [18] and kelen and tudos [19], as well
as the non-linear squares treatment suggested by tidwell
and mortimer [20]. the results obtained are shown in
table ii and it can be observed that r4 , rh and r5 , rh
reactivity ratio values are somewhat different depending
on the applied method. in this sense, the tidwellmortimer reactivity ratios are suggested to be the most
probable because of the well-known higher accuracy of
the non-linear method. fig. 3 shows the 95% conÂ®dence
limits deÂ®ned by the area of the elliptical diagram
determined by application of the mathematical treatment
[19, 21], together with the points of the reactivity ratio

deuterated methanol solution at 30  c.

values obtained by the three methods. these diagrams
conÂ®rm the good approximation of the reactivity ratio
values as indicated by the reduced dimensions of the
ellipse. fig. 4 shows the composition diagrams of both
copolymer systems where the solid lines correspond to
the theoretical diagrams obtained according to the mayolewis [17] equation, and the points are the experimental
values obtained at low conversions. both systems exhibit
similar patterns and moreover, there is good agreement
between the theoretical curve and the experimental data
indicating again the reliability of the calculus and
conÂ®rming the Â®tting to the terminal model. the reaction
gives rise to random sequences with a slightly higher
content of hema in the copolymer chains than in the
feed. thus, there is a tendency (mainly for the
compositions rich in hema) to the formation of short
hema sequences isolating 4hma or 5hma units. this
fact can also be observed in fig. 5 where the

instantaneous sequence distribution in terms of triads of
4hma/hema and 5hma/hema (determined from the
reactivity ratio values using the terminal model) are
plotted against the molar fraction of monomers 4hma
and 5hma in the feed. it can be observed that for
copolymers obtained at low conversion with feed
composition rich in hema, the 4-hma and 5-hma
monomer units are mainly present in h4h and h5h
alternating triads. that means that samples rich in
hema (which are the copolymers more interesting
from a practical point of view) present the active units

isolated between hema units and therefore the
neighbor-to-neighbor interactions will be mainly
4hma-hema or 5hma-hema (in addition to the
hema-hema), which might be important to understand the aqueous behavior. one interesting point is that
h5h population increase with hema content faster than
h4h (as a consequence of the lower value of r 5 with
respect to r 4 ), which means that for the same
composition the 5hma units tend to be more isolated
by hema blocks than the 4hma units.
the previous discussion is referred to the character of
the instantaneous copolymer formed during the reaction.
however, form a practical point of view, high conversion
materials are prepared. in this case, there is a scanning on
feed compositions with conversion as a consequence of
the higher consumption of the more reactive comonomer
(hema). these particular copolymerization reactions
do not change signiÂ®cantly the sequence distribution
with conversion till the last steps of the reaction. fig. 6
shows a contour plot of the h44* or h55* triad
population (taken as an example because it will be
used in the forthcoming discussion) as a function of the
conversion and the initial feed composition, as determined using the well-known skeist and gallardo et al.
[23] treatment. there is a shifting of the triad molar
fraction towards higher values with conversion because
of the higher consumption of hema and the increasing
probability of the formation of h44 or h55 as the 4 or 5
monomer concentration increases. in any case, for

conversion.

538

hema rich copolymers (the courses of the reactions for
a initial feed composition of 0.88 of hema, which
correspond to an 80 wt % are depicted as thick lines)
there is a slightly higher population of cumulative h44
than h55 in most of the range of conversions indicating
that the presence of neighbor 5Â±5 units is less probable
than 4Â±4 in agreement with the instantaneous analysis.

3.1. in vitro studies

copolymers prepared by free radical reactions at low conversion.

figure 6 effect of conversion degree on the distribution of 4-hma or
5-hma centered triads containing two neighboring units of the
respective  xxxd3159xxx  derivatives.

the preparation of the hydrogels was carried out by
copolymerization reactions at total conversion using
concentrations of 4hma and 5hma of 10 and 20 wt %
in order to study the hydration and hydrolysis processes.
copolymer composition calculated by 1 h nmr spectroscopy was similar to that of the feed as expected for
copolymers obtained at total conversion.
the high conversion materials were used to perform
the in vitro assays. fig. 7 shows the equilibrium swelling
degrees of both copolymeric systems as a function of the
average weight composition. the systems exhibit an
interesting non-linear dependence with the composition.
the equilibrium swelling degree of both homopolymers
poly-4hma and poly-5hma are lower than the heq of
poly-hema. on the other hand, the swelling kinetics
also depend on the composition: the initial water uptake
decreases with the increasing 4hma or 5hma unit
content in the copolymer chains (see fig. 8).
these results agree with the dsc data obtained from
the thermal analysis as depicted in fig. 9 where the
dependence of the inverse tg is represented as a function
of the weight composition in the copolymers. the tgs of
the homopolymers poly-4hma and poly-5hma are
higher than the tg of poly-hema because of the rigidity
provided by the aromatic ring and the polar interactions
compared with the Â¯exible oxyethylene group of hema.
on the other hand, the tgs of the copolymers are strongly
deviated from the fox equation (the straight line) being
higher than the weight average of the inverse of the

process for 4-hma-hema (r) and 5-hma-hema () copolymer
systems.

homopolymers. this behavior has been well described
for polar copolymeric systems with hydrogen atoms able
to form h-bonds [24]. the schemes represented in fig. 1
give us a good idea of the high possibility of h-bond
formation because the presence of the polar -nh-,
-cooh- and -oh (of both unit) groups. strong polar
interactions lead to a higher compact structure and to a
lower Â¯exibility. after the immersion in aqueous media,
there is competition between the solvation phenomena
and these strong polar interactions, being the swelling
process governed kinetically by the comonomer composition and the related rigidity, as taken out from the
thermal analysis. that might explain the differences
observed in fig. 8 because the richer in 4hma or 5hma

weight composition of copolymer systems (r) 4-hma-hema and ()
5-hma-hema.

540

the copolymer system is, the more compact is the original
material. finally, from the results obtained in fig. 7, it
seems that there is an optimum composition where the
combination of the Â¯exibility of the oxyethylene residue
and the hydrophilia associated to the presence of such
polar group as cooh, oh and nh in the 4hma or
5hma units, leads to a maximum equilibrium swelling
degree (higher than the heq of both homopolymers).
this maximum appears at hema rich compositions but
slightly different in both copolymer systems,  xxxd1891xxx  and
20 wt % of 4hma or 5hma for 4hma-hema and
5hma-hema, respectively. from the previous discussion on sequence distribution, this displacement in the
maximum could be related to the disappearance of the
interaction neighbor-neighbor 5hma-5hma, which
occurs at lower hema content than in the case of the
4hma- 4hma as a consequence of the analysis of the
copolymerization reactions (see figs 5 and 6). figs 10
and 11 show the cumulative release proÂ®les of both
copolymer systems represented as released drug (in
percentages) as a function of time. the hydrolysis rate is
clearly dependent on ph, being higher at basic ph
because of the well known basic catalysis of the
amidolysis reaction. the release rate at physiological
ph is very low, specially for the 4hma-hema system.
on the other hand, the amide character of the labil bond
makes it sensitive to acid hydrolysis and as a
consequence they exhibit some hydrolysis degree at
acid ph, similar or higher than at neutral ph for the 5 or
4hma's systems. in all the cases, the proÂ®les, after a
initial release, reach a zero order release at least during
several months. the relatively hydrolytical stability of
these hydrophylic formulations provides excellent
characteristics for applications with associated antiinÂ¯ammatory properties, like bone cements, dental Â®lling
materials or even glass alkanoate cements and glass
ionomers. however, analysis would be necessary of the
enzymatic activation of the hydrolytical processes

mainly in physiological conditions, but the results
obtained so far indicate the hydrolytical stability of the
copolymers prepared with relatively high content in
hema, is enough to guarantee the performance of
applications with the additional pharmacological effect
of the 4-asa or  xxxd2579xxx  residues.
the differences between 4- and 5- are related to their
swelling behavior. it was discussed previously that

5hma-hema samples, at that composition range, as
well as the homopolymer poly-5hma, swell signiÂ®catively more than the 4hma derivatives, leading to a
higher water penetration and therefore to a relatively
higher release rate which is in agreement with the
obtained results. on the other hand, the 4hma-hema
10 present the highest release rate for this system while
the 5hma-hema 20 has a much higher release rate than
541

the 4hma-hema 20 in agreement with the swelling
behavior.
a very slow hydrolysis rate can be an advantage in
some speciÂ®c applications such as hydrophilic coatings
in vascular applications. san roman et al. [25, 26] have
successfully used similar polymeric systems for this
particular application. the polymers are expected to
exhibit activity in their macromolecular form as in other
similar systems [15] because of the intrinsic antithrombogenic properties of 4-asa and  xxxd2579xxx , and the
hydrolysis of the amide group leads to (in addition to
the release of the antithrombogenic agent) the formation
of anionic carboxylate residues randomly distributed
along the macromolecular chains (as was discussed in the
Â®rst section of this paper). this fact might improve the
vascular long-term performance.
