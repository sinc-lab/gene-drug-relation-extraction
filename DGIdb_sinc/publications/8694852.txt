act as inhibitors of cpt-19 ( xxxg508xxx   xxxg509xxx ), a mitochondrial
enzyme responsible for long chain acyl camitine formation,
which provides access of long chain fatty acyl-coa to the
site for p-oxidation in the mitochondrial
matrix. recent
evidence suggests that cpt-1 is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane with the catalytic site facing the intermembrane space [17]. of the various agents previously
shown to be cpt-1 inhibitors, oxfenicine, which is converted to the active cpt-1 inhibitor hpg, has been in-

essentially

as described

by mcgarry

et al. [26],

with the exception that a preincubation period was used
prior to enzyme estimation as described by kiorpes et al.
[24]. the incubate consisted of 0.4 ml of incubation buffer

mgclz, 5 fl ethanol, 2.7 mg defatted bsa, and potential
inhibitors as indicated below. preincubation in a shaking
water bath at 37” was initiated by the addition of 50 p,l of
homogenate or mitochondrial preparation. for assays of the
cardiac or liver enzyme, 50 kg of mitochondrial protein and
 xxxd1289xxx  p,g of homogenate protein were utilized per assay to
ensure linearity with protein concentration.
the reaction
was initiated by the addition of 50 fl of substrate mix
containing
 xxxd2832xxx -coa
and [3h]-i-carnitine.
unless
otherwise indicated, the final concentrations
were 50 or
100 p.mol/l  xxxd2832xxx -coa and 400 kmol/l carnitine. the
reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 ~_llof concentrated hci. samples were diluted with 1.45 ml of distilled water, and then the product, [3h]- xxxd2832xxx  carnitine,
was extracted with 1 ml n-butanol as described by kiorpes
et al. [24]. blanks were identical in composition to reaction
tubes except that concentrated
hcl was added prior to
addition of substrate mix. the incubation

time was 4 min

rats of 300 g body weight were killed

by exsanguination under light ether anaesthesia. the hearts
and livers were removed rapidly and placed on ice. homogenates and mitochondria were prepared essentially as described by kiorpes et al. [24], based on the method of
johnson and lardy [25]. briefly, hearts or livers were homogenized at 4“ in isolation buffer (10 mmol/l tris-hcl,
ph 7.4, containing
250 mmol/l sucrose and 1 mmol/l
edta) at 1:5 (w/v), using a polytron pt-3000
(kinematica). the post-nuclear supernatant was obtained after
centrifugation for 10 min at 600 g. in some experiments,
the supernatant was used as such, while in the majority of
experiments a mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 4” for 10 min at 7000 g. the pellet was
washed by resuspension to the original volume in isolation
buffer and centrifugation at 7000 g for 10 min, followed by
resuspension in isolation buffer to approximately 40 mg/ml
protein. in some experiments the mitochondria were pretreated with nagarse, 5 pg/ml, for 10 min at 37”, followed
by addition of 200 p.l of 20% bsa. then the mitochondria
were pelleted and washed as above by centrifugation

we have provided evidence that  xxxd2884xxx  and amiodarone are inhibitors of cardiac and hepatic cpt-1. the cardiac enzyme appears to be more sensitive to inhibition by

hence, the concentrations

bation with malonyl-coa,
and  xxxd2884xxx  did not lead to
greater inhibition than that due to  xxxd2884xxx  alone. at
present we have no explanation
the interaction of  xxxd2884xxx 

for the difference between
with hpg and that with

*

malonyl-coa. although the binding site for  xxxd2884xxx  on
cpt-1 is protected from protease treatment in a way similar
to that for active-site directed agents like  xxxd1739xxx  [33], the

b.

non-competitive
interaction of  xxxd2884xxx  with  xxxd1739xxx  indicates that they inhibit the enzyme at different sites. hpg
and malonyl-coa
both show similar non-competitive
interactions with  xxxd1739xxx  on hepatic cpt-1 [33]. hence,  xxxd2884xxx  appears to be unique among cpt-1 inhibitors described thus far.  xxxd2884xxx  appears to interact with the
same site on cpt-1 as hpg and malonyl-coa,
but unlike
the latter two agents it does not appear to require a protein

on cpt-1 is not identical to that of any previously described endogenous or exogenous inhibitor.

other authors have suggested that the cationic amphiphilic nature of  xxxd2884xxx  and amiodarone, favouring the
formation of ion pairs with polar lipids [34], may facilitate
their cellular actions [9, 161. whether this property contributes to their inhibitory action on cpt-1 is unknown at
present. however, it is possible that they could interact
with phospholipid components of the mitochondrial membrane containing cpt- 1, as well as to some component of
cpt- 1.
malonyl-coa-sensitive
cpt has been identified recently in liver peroxisomes [35] and in cardiac sarcoplasmic
reticulum [36]. in the present experiments, the contribution of extramitochondrial
cpt has not been determined.
however, the ability of  xxxd2884xxx , like malonyl-coa,
to
cause approximately 90% inhibition of cpt activity in the
cardiac homogenate preparations may indicate that any extramitochondrial
sources of the enzyme present in these
preparations are sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd2884xxx .

of cardiac cm- 1 to  xxxd2884xxx 
compared with hepatic cpt-1. this difference may relate
support

a greater

sensitivity

to the fact that cardiac cpt-1

exists as two isoforms only

one of which is similar to the hepatic isoenzyme [37], a
characteristic that may also explain the greater sensitivity
of the cardiac enzyme to malonyl-coa
[38].
the finding that  xxxd2884xxx  and amiodarone are cpt- 1
inhibitors
is consistent
with the previously postulated
“metabolic” mechanism of action of  xxxd2884xxx  [6] and
with the common

mechanisms

of potential

long-term

cumulation of phospholipids as a consequence of prolonged
inhibition of long chain fatty acid metabolism may be a
predictable adverse effect of cpt-1 inhibitors. it remains to
be determined whether regional heterogeneity of drug affinity for cm-1 and/or differences in tissue concentration
inhibitors

may account for variation

tox-

icity of both agents. previous studies have linked the possible occurrence of phospholipidosis, which predisposes towards hepatotoxicity
and peripheral neuropathy seen with
both agents, with a number of amphiphilic compounds [34],
rather than with cm-1 inhibition. however, potential ac-

in predomi-

nant sites of phospholipidosis with differing agents.
in conclusion,  xxxd2884xxx  and amiodarone are inhibitors
of cpt-1 in cardiac and liver mitochondria. as such, they
would be expected to inhibit the access of long chain fatty
acids to the mitochondrial matrix and thereby inhibit long
chain fatty acid oxidation. this mechanism would account
for their anti-angina1 properties. in addition, the inhibition
of long chain acyl camitine formation may contribute towards an anti-arrhythmic
effect in the presence of myocardial ischaemia, since other inhibitors of cm-l
have been
shown to delay the cellular uncoupling effects of ischaemia
in cardiac tissue [23].
although cpt-1 inhibitors have been shown to have
anti-ischaemic
actions in in vitro animal models [22, 391,
this is the first report of inhibition of cm-1 by clinically
useful anti-angina1 agents. as such, a previously defined
biochemical class of drugs (cpt-1 inhibitors) now accords

with a previously defined, therapeutically validated group
of “metabolic” anti-angina1 agents. appreciation that this
biochemical

mechanism

of action

may correlate

with

16.

marked suppression of myocardial ischaemia may facilitate
the development of future anti-angina1 agents, as well as
improving understanding of the actions and potential toxicity of  xxxd2884xxx 

and amiodarone.
