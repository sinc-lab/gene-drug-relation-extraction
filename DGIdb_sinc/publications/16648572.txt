introduction

abstract
the properties of several multitargeted receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors have been studied for their inhibition of
 xxxg526xxx -1 receptor ( xxxg525xxx ) signaling.
a structurally novel, multitargeted  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (abt-869), imatinib (sti571), and four compounds
currently in clinical development ( xxxd252xxx , bay
43-9006,  xxxd1932xxx , and  xxxd3264xxx ) were tested for
inhibition of  xxxg525xxx  signaling in both the enzymatic and
cellular assays. abt-869 showed potent  xxxg525xxx  inhibition in both the enzyme and cell-based assays (ic50s <
20 nmol/l). in contrast to a previous report, we have
found that imatinib has activity against human  xxxg525xxx  in
both assays at submicromolar concentrations. in enzyme
assays, we have found that the inhibition of  xxxg525xxx 
by both abt-869 and imatinib are competitive with
atp, with k i values of 3 and 120 nmol/l, respectively.
 xxxd3264xxx  is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg525xxx  in the enzyme
assay (ic50 = 7 nmol/l) and inhibits receptor phosphorylation in the cellular assay (ic50 = 61 nmol/l).
 xxxd252xxx  was also a potent inhibitor of  xxxg525xxx  in
both assays (enzyme, ic50 = 16 nmol/l; cellular, ic50 =
21 nmol/l), whereas  xxxd3226xxx  is less potent in
the enzyme assay (ic50 = 107 nmol/l) than in the
cellular system (ic50 = 20 nmol/l). in contrast, we found
that  xxxd1932xxx  had less activity in the cellular assay
(ic50 = 535 nmol/l) relative to its enzymatic potency
(ic50 = 26 nmol/l). these results show the use of a
cell-based assay to confirm the inhibitory activity of lead

mammary carcinoma has the highest incidence of all cancer
types in american women, and its incidence rates have
continued to increase since 1986 (1). the mechanism by
which mammary epithelial cells undergo genetic changes
that result in acquisition of the ability to invade and
colonize distant sites is complex (2). normal and malignant
mammary epithelium and the surrounding stromal cells
produce and respond to various growth factors, including
transforming growth factors a and h (3) and fibroblast
growth factors (4). among the stromal cells, macrophages
play a unique role because they are recruited into
mammary gland carcinomas (5), and, in the absence of
such tumor-associated macrophages, metastatic progression of mammary gland tumors is profoundly reduced (6).
macrophages enhance tumor progression through paracrine
circuits involving the production of colony-stimulating
factor ( xxxg524xxx ) by tumor cells (7) or other host-derived
stromal cells and also by extracellular matrix – modulating
functions mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (8). a
recent study has shown that a selective  xxxg525xxx  inhibitor
inhibits monocyte growth and bone degradation (9), and a
multitargeted inhibitor with potent activity against  xxxg525xxx 
is being evaluated in patients with bone metastases (10).
overexpression of  xxxg524xxx  or its receptor ( xxxg525xxx ) occurs
in a significant percentage of breast, ovarian, prostate, and
endometrial cancers (6, 11), and studies using antisense
oligonucleotides to suppress  xxxg524xxx  expression and smallinterfering rna directed against  xxxg524xxx  or  xxxg525xxx 
expression have shown that blockade of this pathway
inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models (12).  xxxg524xxx  null
mice (ob/ob) are resistant to the development of invasive,
metastatic carcinomas. measurements of circulating levels
of  xxxg524xxx  have proven useful in patients with ovarian,
endometrial, and breast carcinoma, both for disease
detection and monitoring of response to therapy (13). for
all of these reasons, the extent of inhibition of  xxxg525xxx 
signaling is an important consideration in the evaluation of
the properties of receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors.
abt-869 is a structurally novel multitargeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (14, 15). this compound is a potent
inhibitor of several class iii receptor tyrosine kinases but
has little activity against other tyrosine kinases or serine/
threonine kinases (15). in preclinical s.c. and orthotopic
tumor growth models, abt-869 has been shown to be

1008 inhibition of phosphorylation of  xxxg525xxx  in cells

efficacious after oral administration against several tumor
types. abt-869 is also effective in murine models of
 xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) – induced edema, angiogenesis, and tumor-associated receptor phosphorylation in vivo (15).
we have examined abt-869 and five other compounds
either marketed or in clinical development (imatinib,
 xxxd252xxx ,  xxxd3226xxx ,  xxxd1932xxx , and  xxxd3264xxx ) as
inhibitors of the  xxxg525xxx  catalytic domain using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (htrf) assay. in addition, the kinetics of the enzymatic inhibition by imatinib
and abt-869 with  xxxg525xxx  has been analyzed. the
inhibitory activity has been confirmed with a cell-based
assay using nih3t3 cells transfected with the full-length
human  xxxg525xxx  gene.

materials and methods
materials
dmem and pbs were purchased from life technologies
(gaithersburg, md). streptavidin-allophycocyanin (phycolink) was purchased from prozyme (san leandro, ca),
and europium chelate anti-phosphotyosine (py20) was
from cis-bio (bedford, ma). the biotinylated peptide
kinase substrate was synthesized by dr. paul richardson
of abbott.
compounds used inthese studies
the characterization of abt-869, n-[4-(3-amino-1hindazol-4-yl)phenyl]-n v-(2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)urea
(fig. 1), has been disclosed (14, 15). the chemical structures
of the kinase inhibitors 6-[2-(methylcarbamoyl)phenylsulfanyl]-3-e -[2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethenyl]indazole ( xxxd252xxx ;
ref. 16), n -(3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorophenyl)-n v-(4(2-methylcarbamoyl-pyridin-4-yl)oxyphenyl)urea (bay
43-9006; ref. 17), 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1h-benzimidazol-2-yl]-2(1h)-quinolinone ( xxxd1932xxx ;
ref. 18), 5-[5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-(3z)-ylidenemethyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1h -pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid-(2deae)amide ( xxxd3264xxx ; ref. 19), and 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-n-[4-methyl-3-[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-phenyl]benzamide (imatinib, sti571; ref. 20)
have been reported. these chemical entities were synthesized at abbott for comparison studies and are designated
in this article using the abbreviations previously used for
these compounds.
purification of  xxxg525xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  enzymes
sf9 cells were engineered to express 6-his- xxxg525xxx  (547972; protein accession no.  xxxg525xxx ) and  xxxg1274xxx  (792-1356)
active kinase domain (soluble cooh-terminal domain

with an nh2-terminal 6-his sequence to facilitate purification, cloned, and expressed in a baculovirus system).
supernatants of the whole-cell lysate were loaded onto
ni-agarose (probond, invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and
proteins were eluted with imidazole containing buffer.
 xxxg525xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  activity was determined by htrf assay
as described below. the peak activity fractions were dialyzed
against 20 mmol/l hepes/naoh buffer (ph 7.5) with
100 mmol/l nacl, 1 mmol/l dtt, 1 mmol/l edta,
and 1% glycerol and applied to a q2 anion exchange
column (bio-rad, hercules, ca) equilibrated with same
buffer. elution of proteins was done with 30 ml of a linear
gradient from 0.1 to 1 mol/l nacl in column buffer at a
flow rate of 1 ml/min. fractions of 1 ml were collected
and assayed for  xxxg525xxx  or  xxxg1274xxx  activity by htrf assay,
and the protein purity was analyzed by sds-page and
western blot. the active form of abl was purchased from
upstate (charlottesville, va).
htrf assay of inhibitors
the  xxxg525xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  ic50 values were determined by
assay of  xxxg525xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  using an atp concentration of
1 mmol/l. a biotinylated peptide (biotin- xxxg1594xxx -aeeeyfflfa-amide) substrate containing a single tyrosine was
used in a microtiter plate assay using htrf methodology
as described in ref. (21). each inhibitor was assayed at
11 concentrations prepared by serial dilution of a dmso
stock solution of the compound. the concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of activity (ic50) was calculated
with mdl assay explorer software using a nonlinear
regression analysis of the concentration response data.
abl was assayed similarly using a different peptide (biotinahx-gaeeeiyaaffa) and at an atp concentration of
10 amol/l.
determination of the k i of abt-869 and imatinib with
rcsf-1r catalytic domain
the range of atp concentrations in the final assay was
0.2 to 1 mmol/l. the imatinib concentrations used were 0,
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 amol/l. the complete reaction
mixture (40 al) in a black microfluor 96-well plate
contained buffer (0.2 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx 
added),  xxxg525xxx  catalytic domain, compound, and atp
and was initiated by the addition of substrate (0.5 amol/l
final). after a 1-hour reaction, a solution (10 al) of
0.5 mol/l edta was added to stop further kinase reaction.
a volume of 50 al of a mixture of streptavidin-allophycocyanain and europium-chelate anti- xxxd1075xxx  in
development buffer was added immediately after the
edta. the response (ratio of 665 and 615 nm fluorescence)
of each well was recorded 1 hour after addition of the
htrf reagents using a packard discovery plate reader. the
background response from wells prequenched with edta
was subtracted from all wells, and the data were analyzed
using lineweaver-burk plots.
effect of inhibitors on levels of phosphorylatedcsf-1r intransfected cells by western blot analysis
nih3t3 cells stably transfected with the cdna for fulllength human  xxxg525xxx  were placed overnight in 100-mm
culture dishes at 3,000,000 per dish. the cells were serum

deprived for 1 hour (dmem/0.1% fetal bovine serum)
and then resuspended in fresh dmem containing 0.1%
fetal bovine serum, with inhibitor compounds diluted
from dmso stock solutions (1% dmso final). the
positive and negative control dishes contained no
inhibitor. after 1 hour, the cells (except negative controls)
were stimulated for 10 minutes with 200 ng/ml human
 xxxg524xxx  (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). after this
treatment, the cells were immediately lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/l tris-hcl
(ph 7.4), 1% igepal, 150 mmol/l nacl, 1 mmol/l
edta, and 0.25% sodium  xxxd1835xxx ] containing
protease inhibitors (complete, roche, indianapolis, in)
and naf (1 mmol/l), and the lysates cleared by
centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a refrigerated microcentrifuge for 15 minutes. the protein concentration was
determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay
(pierce, rockford, il), and 600 ag protein from each
incubation was immunoprecipitated overnight as described (4), with a rat monoclonal antibody to human
 xxxg525xxx  (calbiochem, san diego, ca). the immunocomplexes were then incubated with 0.1 ml of protein g
sepharose beads (pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj),
recovered by centrifugation, and washed with pbs/
tween. after treatment with sds-loading buffer, the
proteins were resolved on a 3% to 8% tris-acetate sdspage gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. for  xxxd1075xxx  analysis,
membranes were probed with anti- xxxd1075xxx 
(clone 4g10, upstate). to determine the total amount of
 xxxg525xxx , the blots were reprobed with an antibody to
 xxxg525xxx  (santa cruz biotechnology). for both determinations, a secondary antibody conjugated to hrpo was
used, and detection of the blots was done using
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (pierce). the total
 xxxd1075xxx  and  xxxg525xxx  bands were digitized by
un-scan-it-gel software (silk scientific, orem, ut) for
quantification. the anti- xxxd1075xxx  bands were
normalized using the corresponding  xxxg525xxx  bands, and

the percent inhibition was calculated at each concentration of inhibitor. ic50 values were estimated by plotting
the percent inhibition at each concentration versus the
logarithm of the inhibitor concentration.
cellular  xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation assay
nih3t3 cells stably transfected with the cdna for fulllength human  xxxg1274xxx  ( xxxg1274xxx ) were maintained in dmem
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 ag/ml  xxxd2191xxx .
 xxxg1274xxx  cells were plated at 20,000 per well into duplicate 96well tissue culture plates and cultured overnight in an
incubator at 37jc with 5% co2 and 80% humidity. the
growth medium was replaced with serum-free growth
medium for 2 hours before compound addition. compounds in dmso were diluted in serum-free growth
medium (final dmso concentration 1%) and added to cells
for 20 minutes before stimulation for 10 minutes with vegf
(50 ng/ml). cells were lysed by addition of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors
and naf and placed on a microtiter plate shaker for 10
minutes. the lysates from duplicate wells were combined,
and 170 al of the combined lysate was added to the  xxxg1274xxx 
elisa plate. the  xxxg1274xxx  elisa plate was prepared by
adding anti- xxxg1274xxx  antibody (1 ag/well; r&d systems) to
an unblocked plate and incubated overnight at 4jc. the
plate was then blocked for at least 1 hour with 200 al/well
of 5% dry milk in pbs. the plate was washed twice with
pbs containing 0.1% tween 20 (pbst) before addition of
the cell lysates. cell lysates were incubated in the  xxxg1274xxx 
elisa plate with constant shaking on a microtiter plate
shaker for 2 hours at room temperature. the cell lysate was
then removed, and the plate was washed five times with
pbst. detection of phospho- xxxg1274xxx  was done using a 1:2,000
dilution of biotinylated 4g10 anti- xxxd1075xxx 
(upstate), incubated with constant shaking for 1.5 hours
at room temperature, and washed five times with pbst;
for detection, a 1:2,000 dilution of streptavidin-hrp
(upstate) was added and incubated with constant shaking
for 1 hour at room temperature. the wells were then
washed five times with pbst and k-blue hrp elisa

results
specificity of abt-869 as an inhibitor of receptor
tyrosine kinases
abt-869 (fig. 1) is an inhibitor of vegf and plateletderived growth factor families of receptor tyrosine kinases,
with potent activity against  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg801xxx , c-kit, and
 xxxg525xxx . however, this compound is not an inhibitor of
fibroblast growth factor receptor,  xxxg681xxx 
receptor, or the soluble tyrosine kinases, such as src or
abl, nor of the serine/threonine kinases tested. the
enzyme inhibition properties of abt-869 are summarized
in table 1 (15).
htrf assays of  xxxg525xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx , and abl
the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of  xxxg525xxx  and
 xxxg1274xxx  was determined by htrf assay of  xxxg525xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx 
active kinase domains using an atp concentration of
1 mmol/l. the abl assays were carried out  xxxd1891xxx  amol/l
atp to provide a more sensitive assay of inhibitor
potencies. these data are summarized in table 2. abt869, and the other compounds (excluding imatinib) were
found to be potent  xxxg1274xxx  inhibitors. although less active
than these other compounds, imatinib has activity against
 xxxg525xxx  at submicromolar concentrations (ic50 = 422
nmol/l). using a commercial preparation of active
recombinant abl for comparison, we found that imatinib
is a moderately potent inhibitor of this enzyme in the
htrf assay, whereas  xxxd252xxx  was unexpectedly found

to be nearly 10-fold more potent than imatinib (ic50 = 52
nmol/l) as an inhibitor of active abl. abt-869 and the
other compounds have little in vitro activity as inhibitors
of abl.
k i of imatinib and abt-869 with  xxxg525xxx 
the kinetics of the reaction of abt-869 and imatinib with
 xxxg525xxx  using various concentrations of atp and inhibitor
was analyzed. the lineweaver-burk analysis of imatinib
inhibition is shown in fig. 2 and shown to be competitive
with atp with a k i of 120 nmol/l. the k i of abt-869 was
similarly analyzed and found to be 3 nmol/l. these
experiments were done with the soluble catalytic domain
construct, and the competitive nature of the inhibition
implies that both compounds bind to the atp-binding site
of  xxxg525xxx .

inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  in a cellular assay
nih3t3 cells transfected with the cdna for  xxxg1274xxx  were
used to examine the activity of abt-869 and the
reference compounds in an elisa measuring the
phosphorylation of  xxxg1274xxx  in cells as described in methods.
the results are summarized in table 2. abt-869 and
 xxxd252xxx  are potent inhibitors of  xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation
(ic50s < 10 nmol/l). the other  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
(excluding imatinib) also showed significant inhibition
of both assays (ic50s < 100 nmol/l). consistent with its
lack of activity in the  xxxg1274xxx  enzyme assay, imatinib is not
an inhibitor of  xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation in the cell-based
elisa assay.

was immunoprecipitated from the cells, and the level
of phosphorylation was determined by western blot
using an anti- xxxd1075xxx  antibody. to estimate as
precisely as possible the relative potencies of the
compounds, incubations were done at five concentrations
selected from 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1,000 nmol/l,
with the concentration range adjusted for the potency
of the inhibitor as shown in fig. 3. abt-869 and the
five other compounds were evaluated, the pictures of
the blots are shown in fig. 3, and the results are
summarized in table 2. complete inhibition of phosphorylation was observed at 100 nmol/l abt-869
(fig. 3a), and the ic50 was estimated to be 16 nmol/l
from a digital analysis of the intensity of the bands
(fig. 4a).  xxxd252xxx  and  xxxd3226xxx  were also potent
inhibitors, whereas  xxxd3264xxx  was less potent.  xxxd1932xxx 
was the least potent of the compounds evaluated in
this assay, with a cellular ic50 (535 nmol/l) substantially
higher than found in the enzyme assay (ic50 = 26
nmol/l). imatinib was found to inhibit the cellular assay
at submicromolar concentrations (fig. 3b), and an ic50
of 118 nmol/l was calculated upon analysis of the
digitized densities of the bands (fig. 4b).

this work describes the characterization of six compounds
as inhibitors of the soluble catalytic domain of  xxxg525xxx  in
an enzymatic activity assay and also as inhibitors of
receptor autophosphorylation in cells expressing the fulllength protein on the cell surface. for comparison, the
assays of these compounds as inhibitors of  xxxg1274xxx  in
corresponding enzyme and cellular systems are included.
the enzyme and cellular experiments are complementary,
as the enzyme assay measures more precisely the affinity
of the compound for the atp binding site, whereas the
cellular assay confirms that the compound is an effective
inhibitor of the activation of the full-length protein by its
natural ligand.
abt-869 is a multitargeted inhibitor with potent
activity against several class iii receptor tyrosine kinases
and also has activity when administered orally in tumor
models in mice (15). the other compounds tested for
comparison have been described in the literature and
have been shown to be kinase inhibitors with anticancer
activity. some compounds did better in one assay than
the other, and abt-869 was shown to be a potent
inhibitor of  xxxg525xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  in both the enzymatic and
cellular assays.

1012 inhibition of phosphorylation of  xxxg525xxx  in cells

the  xxxg525xxx  cellular assay employs the analysis of
 xxxd1075xxx  in  xxxg525xxx  using western blots compared
with the total immunoprecipitated protein. this is a robust
assay system since, as shown in fig. 3, the band
corresponding to  xxxg525xxx  protein does not change intensity
on stimulation of the cells with  xxxg524xxx , and also tyrosine
phosphorylation of this protein is negligible without
induction. the calculated ic50s of the compounds can be
influenced by factors such as the intensities of the bands on
the scanned image and the uniformity of immunoprecipitation and sample loading on the gels. within these
limitations, the use of multiple inhibitor concentrations
and normalization of the  xxxd1075xxx  determination
with the total amount of  xxxg525xxx  in each lane allows a
quantitative estimation of the potencies of the compounds.
although imatinib was designed to be a relatively
selective inhibitor of abl (20), it also has activity against
c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, which is
believed to be important in its therapeutic use (22). we
found that this compound is also an atp-competitive
inhibitor of the  xxxg525xxx  catalytic domain, with a k i of 120
nmol/l, and also has submicromolar activity in our
cellular assay system. our results with  xxxg525xxx  were
unexpected because a previous report stated it does not
affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of murine  xxxg525xxx  at
concentrations up to 10 amol/l. this difference in
observed activity might be due to the species difference
or that, in the previous work (23), the analysis was done
using a western blot of whole-cell lysates without
immunoprecipitation, and it was not stated whether
specific stimulation of  xxxg525xxx  was employed.
while this work was in progress, the inhibition of  xxxg525xxx 
by imatinib in cells was reported (24) and shown to inhibit
 xxxg524xxx -induced proliferation of a cytokine-dependent
cell line. treatment of normal hematopoietic progenitor
cells with imatinib has been associated with inhibition of
monocyte/macrophage colony formation (25), although
this was not shown to be the result of  xxxg525xxx  inhibition.
although imatinib is not as potent an inhibitor of  xxxg525xxx  as
some other kinase inhibitors, the additional effect of
inhibition of this protein could be an important consideration in its use (24).
except for imatinib, the other compounds described in
this work are inhibitors of  xxxg1274xxx , but each has its own
pattern of selectivity of inhibition of other kinases (17 – 19,
26, 27). their observed activity against  xxxg525xxx  is consistent
with previous reports, and  xxxd252xxx  is the only compound in this study other than imatinib having significant
activity against abl. as all of these molecules inhibit
multiple kinases, each compound may have different
activity profile upon evaluation as a therapeutic agent.
our data show that direct assessment of the activation of
 xxxg525xxx  in cells can be accomplished by monitoring
receptor autophosphorylation. the use of a cell-based
assay to confirm the inhibitory activity of lead compounds
and drug candidates, such as abt-869, against the  xxxg525xxx 
protein in situ provides valuable information for their
assessment as anticancer agents.
