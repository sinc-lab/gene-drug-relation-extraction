the genotype of the receptor with which a particular drug interacts may be a between- subject factor that
modifies the pharmacodynamic and consequently the therapeutic response to drugs. subjects with a1 allele
(taq ia restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the gene encoding for the  xxxg656xxx 
( xxxg656xxx ) seem to express lower number of  xxxg656xxx  compared to subjects who do not have this allele. we
investigated whether subjects homozygous for the a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene have decreased response to
 xxxg656xxx  stimulation by  xxxd200xxx  when compared with those homozygous for the a2 allele. two hundred
and two caucasian subjects were genotyped for  xxxg656xxx  taq ia polymorphism, 6.9 % had the genotype a1a1
and 65 % a2a2. nine homozygous subjects\group were selected for the  xxxd200xxx  study. five, 10 and
20 µg\kg of  xxxd200xxx  were administered subcutaneously according to a randomized crossover design.
the main pharmacodynamic criterion was the plasma  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  increase induced by  xxxd200xxx .
secondarily, we measured oral temperature responses and yawns in response to  xxxd200xxx . plasma
 xxxd200xxx  concentrations were similar for the two matched and only genotypically different groups.
 xxxd200xxx  dose-dependently increased serum  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  concentration, and significant effect of
time, dose by time interaction but no effect of genotype or genotype by dose interaction was shown.
 xxxd200xxx  decreased body temperature, significant effect of dose, time, dose by time interaction but no
effect of genotype or genotype by dose interaction were observed. the number of  xxxd200xxx -induced
yawns increased dose-dependently but no significant difference between groups occurred. thus, in this study
 xxxd200xxx -induced responses were not modified by  xxxg656xxx  taq ia polymorphism although the power of
the study could be insufficient to detect subtle differences.

introduction
the dopaminergic system plays a major role in the
reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse and dependence.
according to the hypodopaminergic hypothesis of
addictions, drug abusers would compensate for an
underactive dopamine-mediated reward system by taking
drugs that increase synaptic dopamine concentration
(altman et al., 1996). various dopamine-related genes
have been examined for their possible association with
drug dependencies. interest has focused on the  xxxg656xxx 
subtype.  xxxg656xxx  availability has been found to be

significantly lower in the brain of alcoholics than in nonalcoholics, whereas no difference has been found for the
 xxxg2149xxx  (volkow et al., 1996). similarly,
decreases in  xxxg656xxx  number have been observed in opiatedependent subjects (wang et al., 1997), and striatal  xxxg656xxx 
availability is lower in cocaine-dependent subjects than in
controls (volkow et al., 1997). the lower number of
 xxxg656xxx  in the brain of alcoholic subjects has been found to
be associated with the presence of the a1 allele (taq ia
restriction fragment length polymorphism, rflp) of the
 xxxg656xxx  gene : progressively reduced bmax of the  xxxg656xxx 
was found in subjects with a2a2, a2a1 and a1a1
genotypes in the caudate nuclei, subjects with a2a2
alleles had the highest and those with a1a1 alleles the
lowest values (noble et al., 1991). further, higher
prevalence of the a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene has been
observed in smokers (noble et al., 1994), alcoholics (blum
et al., 1990), subjects with cocaine dependence (noble et

materials and methods
study design
this study was conducted in two steps : (i) subjects were
screened for genotypes of the  xxxg656xxx  gene ; (ii) genotyped
subjects were included in the  xxxd200xxx  study (n l 9
for each homozygous group a1a1 and a2a2).
subjects
subjects who reported themselves as healthy were
recruited by advertisement. they were from paris, france,
and its suburbs. they were selected for genotyping if they
had no chronic disease, no history of drug or alcohol
abuse, according to dsm-iv criteria (american psychiatric association, 1994), if they were non-smokers or if
they smoked less than 5 cigarettes a day on an irregular
basis. none drank alcoholic beverages regularly. only
one member of a family was included. two hundred-andtwo caucasian subjects underwent genotyping (see
below) for determination of alleles a1 and a2 of the
 xxxg656xxx  gene. fourteen subjects (6.9 %) were homozygous

for the genotype a1 (a1a1), 58 subjects had the
genotype a1a2 (28.4 %) and 132 (64.7 %) were homozygous for the genotype a2 (a2a2). nine non-smoker
subjects with genotype a1a1 were included in the
 xxxd200xxx  study and 9 a2a2 subjects were matched
with them for age, gender and body mass index. there
were 7 men and 2 women in each group. all 4 women had
been taking an oral contraceptive for at least 3 months.
they all had normal results on clinical examination, had
normal results of blood chemistry, had normal blood cell
count, normal 12-lead electrocardiograms, negative
results of urine drug screens for opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis, benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and
negative results of serodiagnostic tests for human
immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis b and c viruses, and
also negative results of standard urine analysis. the mean
age of the a1a1 group was  xxxg1309xxx  yr and that of the
a2a2 group 24p2 yr and the mean body mass index
was 23.23p2.1 and 22.51p1.13 kg\m#, respectively.
all 202 subjects gave written informed consent for
 xxxg656xxx  genotyping and for the  xxxd200xxx  study. the
protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the
ho# pital pitie! -salpe# trie' re, paris, france.
determination of taq ia polymorphism of the
 xxxg656xxx 
genomic dna was extracted from lymphocytes in the
venous blood by standard procedures. all subjects were
genotyped to the taq ia marker at the  xxxg656xxx  locus
described by grandy et al. (1993). specific primers 5hgacatgatgccctgcttt-3h and 5h-tcatcaacctcctagaacat-3h corresponding to parts of the
304 bp sequence (accession number in embl bank
l22303) were chosen by oligo 4 (version 4.0-s) and
synthesized. they were used to amplify a 199 bp
fragment (nucleotides position j91 to j290 of the
304 bp sequence) by pcr. the products were digested
with taq i (promega, madison, wi, usa) for 2 h at 65 mc
and subjected to 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis. a single
uncleaved 199 bp fragment indicated the a1a1 genotype, fragments of 199, 110 and 89 bp the a1a2
genotype, and fragments fo 89 and 110 bp only the
a2a2 genotype.
the  xxxd200xxx  study
 xxxd200xxx  was chosen for this study as dopaminergic
agonist for the following reasons.  xxxd200xxx  has been
the most studied dopaminergic agonist to stimulate gh
release (balldin et al., 1985, 1992, 1993 ; ettigi et al., 1975 ;
hollander et al., 1990 ; lal et al., 1973, 1975 ; schmidt et
al., 1996 ; szetchman et al., 1987 ; wiesbeck et al., 1995).

al., 1993) and in polysubstance abusers (comings et al.,
1994 ; smith et al., 1992) although other studies found no
association between a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene and
alcoholism (bolos et al., 1990 ; gelernter et al., 1991) or
cocaine dependence (gelernter et al., 1999). it was
hypothesized that the association of low  xxxg656xxx  number
and the presence of a1 allele is due to a mutation causing
taq ia polymorphism which is in linkage disequilibrium
with a functional allelic variant in the regulatory region of
the  xxxg656xxx  gene leading to reduced  xxxg656xxx  expression
(noble, 1996). however, the functional significance of the
taq ia polymorphism is unclear and a matter of ongoing
controversy.
to our knowledge, only one study assessed the
therapeutic response to a  xxxg656xxx  agonist as a function of
the a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene. in this study, a differential
response to bromocriptine on craving and anxiety was
shown in alcoholics with the a1 allele than in those
without this allele (lawford et al., 1995).
if the presence of the a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene is
associated with lower number of drd2s, it can be
hypothesized that healthy subjects homozygous for the
a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene may have a decreased
response to  xxxg656xxx  stimulation when compared with
those homozygous for the a2 allele. to test this
hypothesis we identified healthy subjects homozygous
for the a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene and compared their
responses to the dopaminergic agonist,  xxxd200xxx ,
with that of healthy subjects homozygous for the a2
allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene.

dopaminergic drug response and taq ia polymorphism

pharmacodynamic assessments
serum  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx . this was determined by an immunoenzymatic method (aia-pack hgh kit). the intra-assay
coefficient of variation with this method is 4.2 % at the

mean concentration of 2.8 ng\ml, 5.4 % at 23.6 ng\ml,
and 4.3 % at 42.2 ng\ml. the inter-assay coefficient of
variation is 3.3 % at the mean concentration of 2.9 ng\ml,
2.6 % at 24.6 ng\ml, and 2.7 % at 45.1 ng\ml. the
detection limit of this method is 0.1 ng\ml. venous blood
samples were drawn 20 and 5 min before injection of
 xxxd200xxx  and 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min
thereafter. to control for the effect of plasma cortisol and
blood glucose concentration on serum gh level, baseline
plasma cortisol was determined before  xxxd200xxx 
administration and blood glucose before and 150 min
after  xxxd200xxx  administration.
oral temperature. this was measured at 15-min intervals
from 30 min before and up to 180 min after injection of
 xxxd200xxx  by an ot-1 oral probe (physitemp instruments, nj) connected to a high resolution thermometer
(bailey instruments inc., saddle brook, nj, usa, model
bat 8). the sensitivity of the thermometer was 0.1 mc.
blood pressure and heart rate. these were recorded at the
same time as oral temperature (dinamap, critikon, tampa,
fl, usa). time to onset and number of yawns were
observed and recorded by one of the investigators (b.b.).
both self-reported and observer-rated adverse events were
recorded.
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd200xxx . venous blood was
drawn for plasma  xxxd200xxx  determinations before and
10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min after administration
of  xxxd200xxx . blood samples were immediately placed
on ice, centrifuged at 4 mc, plasma was rapidly separated
and frozen at k70 mc.  xxxd200xxx  was assayed
according to a modified procedure of sam et al. (1995)
using a hplc method with electrochemical detection.
the limit of quantification was 0.1 ng\ml at a signal-tonoise ratio of 3 and with a coeffcient of variation less than
20 % (n l 8) for precision and accuracy.
statistical analyses
continuous variables (serum gh, plasma  xxxd200xxx 
concentrations, ratio of serum gh\plasma  xxxd200xxx 
concentration, blood pressure and heart rate, oral temperature) were compared with anova. baseline values
were compared with two-way anova (between-subject
factor, genotype l group ; within-subject factor,  xxxd200xxx  dose). changes were compared by three-way
anova (factors : genotype, dose and time) for repeated
measures. areas under the concentration\effect–time
curves (auc, calculated according to the trapezoidal rule)
and maximal increases were compared by anova with
the factors of genotype and dose. between-dose differences were tested by joint univariate bonferroni confidence intervals. baseline plasma cortisol and blood
glucose concentrations were included as covariates in

its gh releasing effect is mediated by drd2s because
selective stimulation of drd1s does not result in gh
secretion (fabbrini et al., 1988). in healthy subjects,
stimulation of gh release by -dopa leads to only a
moderate increase in serum gh concentration and to
relatively high number (30 %) of non-responders (lal et al.,
1975). bromocriptine although more selective for the
drd2s than  xxxd200xxx , has less favourable characteristics for a mechanistic study : after oral administration the peak gh response occurs between 120
and 180 min (farren et al., 1995), the elimination half-life
is relatively long and biphasic (alpha l 6 h, beta l 15 h).
furthermore, it has been reported that repeated injections of  xxxd200xxx  in healthy subjects do not lead to
modification of gh response (szetchman et al., 1987) and
gh response to  xxxd200xxx  is less in women either on or
off oral contraceptives (ettigi et al., 1975). the following
doses of  xxxd200xxx  have been chosen : 5 µg\kg body
weight is the lowest  xxxd200xxx  dose that modifies
serum gh concentration (lal et al., 1975) ; 10 µg\kg body
weight is used in most studies (balldin et al., 1985, 1992,
1993 ; ettigi et al., 1975 ; hollander et al., 1990 ; lal et al.,
1975 ; szetchman et al., 1987 ; wiesbeck at al., 1995) ; the
dose of 20 µg\kg body weight results systematically in
increases in serum gh concentrations although it also
elicits vomiting (lal et al., 1973).  xxxd1927xxx  is largely
used to antagonize  xxxd200xxx -induced vomiting but it
decreases serum gh response to  xxxd200xxx  (lal et al.,
1982) and was therefore not given to prevent vomiting.
because 20 µg\kg of  xxxd200xxx  induces vomiting in
almost all subjects, and vomiting is known to be a
symptom with high carry-over effect, it was decided to
give 5 and 10 µg\kg of  xxxd200xxx  according to a
randomization schedule and to inject the 20 µg\kg dose
into all subjects during the third period of administration.
the doses of 5 and 10 µg\kg were given double blind.
the  xxxd200xxx  tests were performed at 1-wk
intervals in the centre d’investigation clinique, ho# pital
pitie! -salpe# trie' re, paris, france. the subjects arrived at
07 : 00 hours after an overnight fast. an indwelling
catheter was introduced in a forearm vein for blood
sampling. at 08 : 00 hours  xxxd200xxx  was given
subcutaneously in the abdominal wall. subjects remained
in the supine position until lunch which was served
between 12 : 30 and 13 : 00 hours. the subjects left the
ward between 16 : 00 and 17 : 00 hours.

analyses of serum gh concentration. frequencies were
compared with the chi# test and cochran’s q ajdusted for
the number of comparisons. the number of yawns was
compared by non-parametric two-factor anova (zar,
1984) with the factors genotype and dose of  xxxd200xxx . differences were considered to be significant if p
values were less than 0.05. data are presented as means

fifty-three  xxxd200xxx  tests were performed. one
subject of the a1a1 group dropped out of the study
between the second and third period (he did not receive
the 20 µg\kg dose) because of a vagal malaise.

reported 21 min after injection of 10 µg\kg of  xxxd200xxx  an episode of depersonalization lasting 9 min
(feeling ‘ disconnected from reality, hearing the voices of
the investigators from afar ’) ; one man (group a2a2) had
a penile erection with the 5 and 10 µg\kg doses lasting 4

vagal malaise (5 µg\kg dose) and did not receive the
20 µg\kg dose.
discussion
the hypothesis of this study was that subjects homozygous for the a1 allele of the  xxxg656xxx  gene would have
blunted pharmacodynamic responses to the dopaminergic
agonist  xxxd200xxx . while plasma  xxxd200xxx  concentration was similar,  xxxd200xxx -induced increases in
serum gh and oral temperature responses, and yawns
showed no difference between subjects homozygous for
the a1 or a2 alleles of the  xxxg656xxx  gene.
two studies assessed  xxxd200xxx -induced plasma
gh responses as a function of genotype of the  xxxg656xxx .
both studies used only one  xxxd200xxx  dose (10 µg\kg).
heinz et al. (1996) assessed  xxxd200xxx -induced gh
responses in alcohol dependent subjects (group a1a1, n
l 3 ; group a1a2, n l 31 ; group a2a2, n l 63).
 xxxd200xxx -induced peak gh responses were around
7 ng\ml in all three groups with standard deviations
ranging from 9 to 12 ng\ml. thus, peak gh responses

were lower than in the present study with healthy
subjects (mean peak gh with 10 µg\kg of  xxxd200xxx  ;
group a1a1 : 17.5p12.6 ng\ml ; group a2a2 : 26.5p
19.9 ng\ml) but similar in subjects with different alleles.
the authors concluded that with a power of 90 %, more
than 350 subjects per group would be required in each
group if a hypothetical interaction between  xxxg656xxx  taq ia
rflp and dopamine receptor sensitivity was to be
observed. in the second study the effect of a g
substitution polymorphism in the 3 ’ untranslated region
of exon 8 of the  xxxg656xxx  was also evaluated in alcoholics.
 xxxd200xxx - induced serum gh responses were measured during regular alcohol intake, the day of last alcohol
intake, the first day without alcohol and 3 months later.
significantly blunted gh response was observed in the
group with alleles a\a but only on the last day of alcohol
intake. three months later the effect of genotype on
 xxxd200xxx -induced gh responses was no longer
present in alcoholics without relapse (finckh et al., 1997).
 xxxd200xxx  elicits dose-dependent hypothermia
(puech et al., 1974), and this hypothermic effect is  xxxg656xxx 
dependent ; a selective  xxxg656xxx  agonist reduces temperature
but a selective  xxxg655xxx  agonist fails to modify it (verma et
al., 1993). in the present study  xxxd200xxx  reduced oral
temperature, more precisely, it antagonized the physiological morning increase in body temperature. the  xxxg656xxx 
genotype did not affect temperature responses to  xxxg656xxx 
stimulation by  xxxd200xxx .
although the precise mechanisms of yawns are not
known, it is well established that dopaminergic agonists
induce yawns in animals and this action is antagonized by
neuroleptics. even low doses of  xxxd200xxx  (less than
5 µg\kg) induce yawning in healthy subjects and
 xxxd200xxx -induced yawning has been proposed to
assess dopaminergic responsiveness (blin et al., 1988,
1990). in the present study, a clear dose-dependent
relationship but no effect of genotype were shown.

 xxxg656xxx  genotype …

dopaminergic drug response and taq ia polymorphism

genetic heterogeneity, which has been found for this
polymorphism (kidd et al., 1996). further studies aimed to
assess the role of genotype in  xxxg656xxx -dependent drug
responses may need to use genetic haplotypes including
several polymorphisms of the  xxxg656xxx  gene.

this study has some limitations that warrant a cautious
interpretation of the results. subjects homozygous for the
a1 and a2 alleles of  xxxg656xxx  were selected because we
estimated that differences would be greater between
homozygous subjects. this very strict selection criterion
led to the inclusion of only 18 subjects out of 202
screened. the power of the study (based on area under the
serum gh concentration curves) to detect small differences is limited. power analysis showed that with 80 %
power a significant difference (p l 0.05) would have been
obtained in 118 subjects (with 5 µg\kg  xxxd200xxx ), in
247 subjects (with 10 µg\kg  xxxd200xxx ) and in 715
subjects (with 20 µg\kg  xxxd200xxx ). this is in line with
the results of heinz et al. (1996) who used the same
method and achieved the same conclusion. on the other
hand, with 9 subjects per group, the power to detect a
difference at p l 0.05 was 0.13 and the effect-size
measure, the epsilon# statistic that describes the proportion of
total variability attributable to a factor (genotype) was
also near 0 (0.1) showing that difference in genotype
probably does not contribute to the response to  xxxd200xxx . that means that if taq ia rflp influenced
serum gh responses to  xxxd200xxx , the magnitude of
the effect would be extremely small and would be of only
negligible clinical significance.
the functional significance of the taq ia polymorphism of  xxxg656xxx  is unknown. the dopaminergic
hypothesis of drug and alcohol dependence postulates
intrinsic deficits in the mesolimbic reward systems
(altman et al., 1996). the finding that the number of
 xxxg656xxx  in the brain of alcoholics is associated with the
presence of the a1 allele of taq ia rflp of  xxxg656xxx  agrees
with this hypothesis (noble et al., 1991). based on the
hypodopaminergic hypothesis of alcoholism, bromocriptine, a  xxxg656xxx  postsynaptic agonist was administered
to alcoholics with either the a1 (a1a1 and a1a2
genotypes) or the a2 (a2a2 genotype) allele of the
 xxxg656xxx  gene (lawford et al., 1995). in the 52 alcoholics
who completed the study craving for alcohol and anxiety,
but not depression, decreased significantly more with
bromocriptine (n l 14) than with placebo (n l 4) in the
a1 group during weeks 3–6. moreover, attrition to
retention ratio was significantly higher in the placebo a1
group than in the bromocriptine a1 group during weeks
3–6. no differences were observed during the first 3 wk.
thus, this study showed some differential effects of a
dopaminergic agonist on surrogate endpoints. however,
there has been no replication of these results and direct
assessment of the dopaminergic response (heinz et al.,
1996) did not confirm differential response as a function of
the taq ia  xxxg656xxx  polymorphism.
the lack of effect of taq ia polymorphism on drd2related drug response may be due to the important
