the contribution of endothelin to the genesis of neointimal development in collared
rabbit carotid arteries, a widely accepted model of atherosclerosis, was investigated. three sets of
rabbits were studied. in the first group, a non-occlusive, biologically inert silastic collar was
positioned around the right carotid artery of the rabbit. in another group, the application of the
collar was accompanied by endothelial denudation via a fogarty arterial balloon catheter, while the
third group of animals underwent only endothelial denudation. after two weeks, intimal hyperplasia
of a similar degree was observed in all groups. the administration of the nonselective etaietr,
receptor antagonist  xxxd358xxx , significantly reduced both the neointimal area and the intimalmedia
area ratio in all groups. however, the beneficial effects of  xxxd358xxx  were less pronounced in
balloon injured vessels than in collared ones. the results of the present study indicate that i)
endothelin has a key role in the development of intimal hyperplasia following arterial collaring, ii)
the contribution of endothelin to intimal hyperplasia is greater in collared arteries that in balloon
injured ones, and iii) the nonselective eta/ xxxg677xxx  antagonists are potential tools for the
prevention of intimal hyperplasia. 0 1998 elsevier science inc.

introduction

intimal hyperplasia is considered one of the major components of vascular proliferative disorders
such as atherosclerosis and restenosis following procedures of myocardial revascularization.
various growth factors have been hypothesized to be involved in the mechanisms responsible for
the genesis of intimal hyperplasia. recently, it has been suggested that endothelin (et), a potent
vasoconstrictor, could importantly contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia. in fact,
endothelin was shown to act as a growth promoter of vascular smooth muscle cells both in vitro
and in vivo (l-5), and an increased content of et-l in previously denuded carotid arteries was
reported (6,7). furthermore, although the role of the et receptor subtypes in the development of
intimal hyperplasia after endothelial removal needs still to be clarified (6,8), the administration of
et receptor antagonists was able to inhibit intimal hyperplasia formation in the rat balloon injury

model (3,9,10) and in a porcine coronary stent model (11). however, to the best of our knowledge,
the contribution of endothelin to the development of intimal hyperplasia in experimental models
such as the collared artery model, where the endothelium is preserved (12), has never been
investigated. we therefore investigated whether endothelin contributes to the genesis of intimal
lesion under experimental conditions which preserve the endothelium and contemporarily induce
the development of intimal hyperplasia (12). to that purpose, we evaluated the in vivo effects of
the administration
of the nonselective
et*/etn receptor antagonist  xxxd358xxx ,
on intimal
hyperplasia induced by the positioning of a hollow silastic collar around the common carotid artery
(12). furthermore,
we also investigated the effects of endothelin receptor blockade on the
development of intimal hyperplasia after removal of endothelium by balloon, with the aim of
verifying whether i) there were significant differences in the contribution of endothelin to the
neointima formation between the two models, and ii) the entity of intimal hyperplasia after removal
of endothelium could be enhanced by collaring.
materials and methods
animals. thirty-six male new zealand white (nzw) rabbits (charles river, italy), weighing 2.5 3.0 kg, were studied. the animals were individually caged in a room with artificially controlled
temperature (21-24°c) and a 12h light - 12h dark cycle. water and food were provided ad libitum.
animal care and use followed the directive of the council of european
communities
(86/609/eec).
animal model. anesthesia was induced intramuscularly with ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam
(0.1 mg/kg), and orotracheai intubation was attempted immediately after loss of consciousness. if
the rabbit did not chew when this was attempted, the level of unconsciousness was judged to be
sufficient. a cuffed endotracheal tube of 3.0 mm i.d., (d.a.r., mirandola, italy) was inserted into
the trachea, and connected to a respiratory pump (mod. 6025, ugo basile, italy), set at a tidal
volume of 10 ml/kg. the ventilatory rate was adjusted to 30-35 breaths/mm (0.50-0.58 hz) to keep
end-tidal co2 between 35 and 37 mmhg. end-tidal anaesthetic and carbon dioxide levels were
continuously monitored (gas monitor, 5250 rgm, ohrneda, england). pancuronium bromide (0.1
mg/kg intravenously)
was injected to induce muscle relaxation and facilitate ventilation
mechanically. anesthesia was maintained with end-tidal 1.8% isoflurane (1 mac) in a gaseous
mixture of nitrous oxide (nzo) and oxygen (02) (50/50% v/v). body temperature and lead ii of the
electrocardiogram (ecg) were monitored continuosly. a 24-gauge catheter needle was inserted
percutaneously into the marginal ear vein and an intravenous flow control system (dial-a-flo,
abbott) was attached to it. lactated ringer’s solution was infused at 4 ml/kg/h throughout the
study.
in a first series of experiments consisting of 2 groups of 7 rabbits each (a and b), both carotid
arteries were exposed surgically, and the right carotid artery was enclosed by a non-occlusive,
biologically inert silastic collar of 1.0 cm length and an internal diameter of 3.5 mm (volume of
about 96 mm3). in all experiments the contralateral carotid from the same animal was used as a
control and was surgically manipulated in an identical fashion and for the same time as the carotid
enclosed by the collar (sham-operated control).
in a second series of experiments, 2 groups of 5 rabbits each (c and d) were anesthetized as above,
and the bifurcation of both common carotid arteries were exposed surgically. thereafter, a 3f
fogarty arterial balloon catheter was inserted in the right common carotid artery and advanced into
the aortic arch. the balloon was inflated with a fixed volume of fluid, and slowly pulled through the
carotid artery to the bifircation. the procedure was repeated three times to ensure complete
removal of the endothelium. thereafter, the right external carotid artery was ligated, and the right
common carotid artery was enclosed by a non-occlusive, biologically inert silastic collar of length
and internal diameter equal to that above described. in all experiments the contralateral carotid

from the same animal was used as a control and was surgically manipulated in an identical fashion
and for the same time as the denuded carotid artery (sham-operated control).
in a third series of experiments, 2 groups of 6 rabbits each (e and f) were anesthetized as above. in
both groups the right common carotid artery was denuded, whereas the contralateral carotid was
used as a control and was surgically manipulated in an identical fashion and for the same time as the
disendothelized carotid artery (sham-operated control).
the b, d and f groups of rabbits were treated with  xxxd358xxx  (ho&an-la
roche, basel,
switzerland) at the dosage of 10 mg/kg/day iv., whereas 4 c and e groups received the
equivalent volume of vehicle, beginning 1 day before surgery and continuing for 14 days until
necropsy. the dosage protocol chosen for  xxxd358xxx  was based on in vitro and in vivo studies (13).
in addition, preliminary in vivo studies performed by this laboratory before the beginning of the
protocol, indicated that  xxxd358xxx  at the dose of 10 mg/‘kddie, significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited the
pressor responses to big et-l (0.1 nmol/kg) with a long duration of action. therefore, the dosage
of  xxxd358xxx  appeared to be sufficient to antagonize the endothelin binding to eta receptors in
vivo. data from literature (13) also indicates that  xxxd358xxx  at the dose of 10 mgn<g i.v. is sufficient
to inhibit completely the depressor effects of the etb agonist sarafotoxin s6c.
in a separate group of 4 animals, a 22-gauge catheter needle was inserted percutaneously into the
marginal ear artery under local anesthesia, to measure arterial blood pressure and evaluate the
hemodynamic acute effects after the administration of  xxxd358xxx .
histologv and histomorphometric
analysis, the rabbits were sacrificed after 14 days with an
overdose of pentobarbital and both carotids were isolated and excised. the arteries were divided
into 3 regions of about 1omm length : a tract proximal to the collar, a mid region which had been
surrounded by the collar, and a tract distal to the collar. from each specimen, cross sections
selected from identical regions were fixed for 2 hours in buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin. five micrometer thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and van giesonweigert. one cross section from each region was rapidly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -8o’c before use. immunohistochemical
studies were made on frozen sections with
mca641 mouse anti human endothelium (serotec) and a2547 mouse anti-alpha smooth muscle
the
peroxidase-antiperoxidase
method,
and
diaminobenzidine
actin
(sigma),
using
tetrahydrochloride was used as chromogen.
histomorphometric
analysis was performed on all the rabbits with the use of a semiautomatic
image-analyzer (quantimet 500, leica, cambridge united kingdom). measurements were made
on three cross sections selected from identical regions of the three tracts. the total area of the
medial layer, and the area of intimal hyperplasia (the neointimal tissue overlying the internal elastic
membrane) were measured at 10x magnification. neointimal growth was evaluated in terms of
intimal-to-medial area ratio. although the specimens were not fixed under physiological distention
pressure, quantitative comparisons among the groups are justified because all specimens were
prepared under the same conditions (14).
statistical analysis. data were averaged for each group and expressed as mean + standard
deviation. statistical significance was determined by one way anova, followed by fisher’s test to
assess specific group differences (statview 4.02 statistical package). a p value < .05 was
considered significant.

in arterial blood pressure. at harvest, all the carotid arteries were patent and did not show any
abnormality on gross examination, except for a diffuse periadventitial fibrous thickening in the
region surrounded by the collar.
in the first experimental protocol, groups a and b carotid arteries showed a severe (group a) to
very mild (group b) degree of intimal hyperplasia in the region which had been surrounded by the
collar (fig. la, ib). intimal hyperplasia consisted of a neo-growth of spindle-shaped cells,
identified as smooth muscle cells because of their positive staining for actine, and an extracellular
matrix lined by a continuous layer of endothelial cells, either flat or swollen. neither intimal
inflammatory infiltrates, nor medial lesions were observed. the carotid segments which were not
enclosed in the collar, did not show any intimal lesion. in the sham-operated left carotid arteries, no
noticeable changes could be detected (fig. 2). on histomorphometric analysis, both the neointimal
area and the intima/media area ratio were significantly lower in  xxxd358xxx -treated rabbits (group b)
than in vehicle-treated animals (group a) (respectively 0.03 f 0.007 mm2 vs 0.14 + 0.02 mm2,
p< 0.01, and 13% f 2% vs 29% k 4%, pco.01) (fig 3).
in the second experimental protocol, intimal hyperplasia was present in both c and d group carotid
arteries, with morphological features similar to those observed in a and b groups. morphometric
analysis showed significant differences in neointimal thickening between c group and d group.
both the neointimal area and the intima/media area ratio were significantly lower in group d
carotid arteries than in group c (0.08 _+0.003 mm2 vs 0.13 f 0.01 mm2, pco.05 and 18% k 0.7%
vs 25% f 2%, p<o.o5, respectively) (fig 3). the comparison between  xxxd358xxx -treated groups
revealed that both intimal area and intima/media area ratio were significantly lower in group b than
in group d (0.03 f 0.007 mm2 vs 0.08 i 0.003 mm2, pco.05, and 13 % + 2 % vs 18% _+0.7%,
pco.05) (fig 3).
in the third experimental protocol, intimal hyperplasia was present in both e and f groups. again,
both the neointimal area and the intima/media area ratio were significantly lower in group f carotid
arteries than in group e (0.07 st 0.005 mm2 vs 0.11 f 0.05 mm2, pco.05 and 17% f 0.8% vs 25%
+ l%, pco.05, respectively) (fig 3). the comparison between  xxxd358xxx -treated groups revealed
that both intimal area and intima/media area ratio were significantly lower in group b than in
groups d and f (fig 3).

discussion

our study was conducted in an animal model of intimal hyperplasia that allowed us to study the
role of endothelin under experimental conditions which preserve the endothelium, and at the same
time stimulate the proliferative activity of vascular smooth muscle cells. the most important finding
of this study was that endothelin contributes importantly to the development of intimal hyperplasia.
although the importance of endothelin in the development of intimal hyperplasia in the balloon
injury model has already been highlighted (3,9,10), we are able for the first time to report that the
involvement of endothelin in the development of intimal hyperplasia can also occur in
endothelialized arterial tracts. we obviously do not know which type of stimulus is involved in the
release of endothelin from the endothelium at present. however, taking into account that ischemia
of the arterial wall (12) and changes in hemodynamic conditions (15) were reported after the
collaring occurred, we speculate that these conditions are responsible for the release of endothelin
in the present model.

also reduced intimal hyperplasia in other groups (groups d and f) even if in a less
pronounced manner. rabbit carotid arteries were treated with vehicle of  xxxd358xxx

a tiuther significant result of our study was that  xxxd358xxx  induced a greater decrease in neointimal
formation in collared arteries than in balloon injured ones, from which we conclude that the amount
of endothelin released in collared arteries is greater than that involved in balloon injured arteries. in
addition, we also conclude that in de-endothelialized
vessels, collaring does not contribute
significantly to neointima formation, because collaring did not influence the magnitude of intimal
lesions after removal of the endothelium.
a final comment is also warranted regarding some possible limitations of our study. first, we used
a nonselective eta/et* receptor antagonist. because several endothelin receptor subtypes have
been described based on in vitro and in vivo pharmacological evidence (8, 16-19) we do not know
how much the blockade of ets receptors, and in particular the  xxxg677xxx  that mediates
vasoconstriction,
contributes to the decrease of neointimal lesion formation. studies of in situ
hibridization performed in the rat balloon injury model have reported an increased expression of
mrna for eta but not for etb in the developing lesions (3). however, it cannot be ruled out that
the blockade of the etn receptor that mediates vasoconstriction may contribute to a reduction in
the development of intimal hyperplasia, although establishing the relative contribution of the two
receptors to the neointima formation was not among the objectives of our study. second, although
one can hypothesize that changes in the endothelial production of endothelin contribute to the
neointimal development in collared arteries, the exact cellular sites of these changes were not
identified by specific studies (i.e in situ hybridization).
in conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that i) endothelin has a key role in the
development of intimal hyperplasia following arterial collaring, ii) the contribution of endothelin to
intimal hyperplasia is greater in collared arteries that in balloon injured ones, and iii) the
nonselective et.&tb receptor antagonists are potential tools for the prevention of intimal
hyperplasia.
