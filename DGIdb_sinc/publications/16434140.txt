abstract
this study reports the solubilization of the rat synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2233xxx , the brain binding site for the antiepileptic drug  xxxd2466xxx 
(lev), and its characterization. n-dodecyl-␤-d-maltoside (ddm) was the best detergent at achieving a high percentage of  xxxg2233xxx  solubilization
and at maintaining the binding characteristics of a tritiated form of a more potent analogue of lev, [3 h]ucb 30889 ((2s)-2-[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2oxopyrrolidin-1-yl]butanamide). scatchard analysis revealed that approximately 25% of  xxxg2233xxx  proteins from brain membranes are solubilized by
ddm under optimal conditions. competition binding experiments with a variety of lev analogues indicated that [3 h]ucb 30889 labels the same
binding site in both crude homogenates and soluble extracts, with still high stereoselectivity. after immunoprecipitation of  xxxg2233xxx  from solubilized
rat brain membranes, binding properties of [3 h]ucb 30889 to  xxxg2233xxx  and association with synaptotagmin i were maintained. the two other isoforms
sv2b and sv2c were found to be co-immunoprecipitated with  xxxg2233xxx . the solubilization and immunopurification of  xxxg2233xxx  with unmodified
ligand affinities and synaptotagmin i interaction provides the starting point for future protein–protein interactions and structural studies.

 xxxg2233xxx  proteins are 12 transmembrane glycoproteins localised in
synaptic vesicles and implicated in the regulation of synaptic
vesicle exocytosis [8,16]. three  xxxg2233xxx  isoforms, called  xxxg2233xxx ,
sv2b, and sv2c, have been identified and show a unique distribution in brain [2,3,10,17].  xxxg2233xxx  is the most widely distributed,
being ubiquitous in the central nervous system and present in
endocrine cells [1,5].  xxxg2233xxx  knock-out (ko) mice, as well as
double  xxxg2233xxx /sv2b ko, exhibit a severe seizure phenotype
[8,16]. although its molecular function remains unknown, the
altered neurotransmission observed in these mice, in the absence
of changes in either synapse or synaptic vesicle density or morphology [8,16,31], suggests that  xxxg2233xxx  acts as a modulator of
vesicle fusion.
we have recently identified the protein  xxxg2233xxx  as the brain
binding site of the novel antiepileptic drug  xxxd2466xxx 
(lev; (s)-␣-ethyl- xxxd2962xxx ;  xxxd2466xxx ® )
[21]. used as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of refractory
partial epilepsy in adults [15], lev acts differently than conventional antiepileptic drugs (aeds) [18,23,26] and appears devoid

of direct effects on the three main mechanisms involved in the
anti-seizure action of established aeds (gabaergic facilitation or inhibition of either na+ or low-voltage activated ca2+
currents) [24]. recently lev has been shown to inhibit calcium
release from ip3-sensitive stores in pc12 cells [6]. however,
the absence of a known function of  xxxg2233xxx  prevents the elucidation of lev’s mechanism(s) of action. to enable further
functional (e.g. protein–protein interactions, post-translational
modifications) or structural studies on  xxxg2233xxx , we decided to
determine the optimal mode of solubilization of this membrane
protein. we used the tritiated form of a potent analogue of lev
named ucb 30889 ((2s)-2-[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin1-yl]butanamide) to characterize the binding properties of the
solubilized form of  xxxg2233xxx . the high affinity and specific activity of this radioligand have already been proved as a useful tool
to characterize the lev binding site [11,12]. in this paper, we
report the solubilization and characterization of the  xxxg2233xxx  protein from rat brain membranes.

amersham biosciences (roosendaal, the netherlands). detergents were all purchased from sigma–aldrich (bornem, belgium), except np40 and octylglucoside that were purchased
from roche diagnostics (vilvoorde, belgium), and analogues
of n-dodecyl-␤-d-maltoside that were from anatrace (maumee,
usa). bca reagent kit was purchased from perbio science
(erembodegem, belgium) and protein a-sepharose beads cl4b from amersham. antibodies directed against  xxxg2233xxx  (sc11936), b (sc-11941) and c (sc-11944) were from santa-cruz
biotechnologies (ca, usa). antibodies anti-synaptotagmin i
(syn i) were from calbiochem (san diego, usa; ref. 573828)
for the polyclonal and from synaptic system (goettingen, germany; ref. 105011) for the monoclonal.
rat cortical membranes and lp2 subcellular fraction,
enriched in synaptic vesicles, were prepared as previously
described [11,12]. for solubilization, aliquots of membrane suspension were diluted in a solubilization buffer (tris-hcl 20 mm
ph 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, protease inhibitors complete roche)
containing n-dodecyl-␤-d-maltoside 3.9 mm (except otherwise
stated) or other detergents as indicated in table 1, incubated
for 1 h (except otherwise stated) at 4 ◦ c and centrifuged at 4 ◦ c
for 1 h at 100,000 × g. proteins of the supernatants and the pellets were measured with the bca reagent kit. for western-blot
analysis, they were separated by sds-page, and tranferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with an antibody
against  xxxg2233xxx .

binding experiments were performed as described in [12]
and using 150 ␮g proteins/assay of brain membranes or soluble
extracts, and 1–2 nm of [3 h]ucb 30889. gf/c glass fibre filters
were pre-soaked in 1% polyethyleneimine. in saturation binding
studies, proteins were incubated with concentrations of [3 h]ucb
30889 ranging from 1 to 250 nm (concentrations above 28 nm
were obtained by isotopic dilution).
for immunoprecipitation experiments, 4 ␮g of polyclonal
antibodies against  xxxg2233xxx , sv2b, or sv2c, 4 ␮g of monoclonal
anti-synaptotagmin i (syn i) or 10 ␮l of polyclonal anti-syn i
antibodies were added to 1–1.5 mg of soluble extract for a 2 h
incubation at 4 ◦ c, and then incubated with protein a-sepharose
beads for 1 h at 4 ◦ c. for experiments on lp2 subcellular fraction, antibodies were added to 0.5 mg of proteins. beads were
washed with either tris 10 mm ph 7.5 (buffer a) three times
or two times with buffer a containing 150 mm nacl, 2 mm
edta, once with buffer a containing 500 mm nacl, 2 mm
edta, then once with buffer a (indicated as “nacl+” condition
in fig. 3). the beads containing the immunopurified  xxxg2233xxx  were
collected and either incubated with the [3 h]ucb 30889 as indicated above or submitted to electrophoresis. in the latter case,
bead pellets were boiled for 5 min in sds sample buffer containing ␤- xxxd26xxx  and submitted to western-blot analysis
as indicated above.

ca), according to equations describing several binding models [25]. ic50 were corrected to ki by applying the cheng and
prusoff [7] equation (ic50 = ki (1+l/kd )) where ic50 is the concentration of the test substance inhibiting by 50% the radioligand
specific binding, ki is the test substance equilibrium dissociation constant, l is the free radioligand concentration and kd is
the radioligand equilibrium dissociation constant).
several detergents were tested for their ability to maintain
the binding of [3 h]ucb 30889 to the solubilized  xxxg2233xxx . the
simple addition of octylglucoside, np40, triton x-100 and triton x-114 in the binding reaction buffer completely inhibited
the specific binding of [3 h]ucb 30889 to rat cortical membranes
(table 1, percentage of specific binding). among the other detergents tested, ddm, chaps and digitonine did not inhibit the
specific binding and were the best at maintaining maximum
binding following solubilization of rat cortical membranes (percentage of solubilized binding sites), while  xxxd1835xxx  and
tween-20 displayed some intermediate capacity to retain the
ligand binding. western-blot analysis of solubilized  xxxg2233xxx  by
either ddm, chaps, octylglucoside,  xxxd1835xxx , digitonine or tween-20, indicated that the highest recovery of soluble
 xxxg2233xxx  in the supernatant was obtained with ddm (fig. 1). note
that whereas the percentage of solubilized binding sites with
digitonine or ddm are similar, digitonine did not permit to
recover equal amount of  xxxg2233xxx  after western-blot. this may
be due to interference of this detergent with the binding assay.
mixing the best detergents of this first set of experiments, ddm
and chaps, or using various analogues of ddm, with acyl
chains of different length or structure, did not increase the number of solubilized binding sites (not shown). looking for the best
conditions for  xxxg2233xxx  solubilization by ddm, we found that the

highest binding level recovered after solubilization was obtained
for a ratio d/p of 1, a ddm concentration of 3.9 mm, 15-60 min
of incubation time, and was not improved by an addition of salts
(not shown). therefore, ddm was chosen as the detergent for
further experimentation on solubilization and characterization
of  xxxg2233xxx  and all other experiments were done with this protocol
and using an incubation time of 60 min.
performing saturation binding curves of [3 h]ucb 30889, we
found a maximum binding capacity (bmax ) of 8.5 ± 3.7 pmol/mg
protein in solubilized cortical membranes (fig. 2a) and of
15.6 ± 5.6 pmol/mg protein in native membranes (mean ± s.d.,
n = 6 and 5, respectively). saturation binding curves of [3 h]ucb
30889 were compatible with the labelling of a homogeneous
population of binding sites. considering that half of the crude
membrane proteins are solubilized by ddm (table 1), these
results indicate that approximately 25% of the crude membrane
sites are solubilized by ddm under these conditions, which was
nearly the same as illustrated in table 1. a slight, but not significant, decrease in the affinity (kd ) of [3 h]ucb 30889 was observed
after solubilization (90 ± 37 nm, compared to 48 ± 15 nm for
crude homogenates, mean ± s.d.). furthermore, in competition
binding experiments using a variety of lev analogues (fig. 2b),
calculated pki values were, in soluble extracts and crude membranes, respectively, 5.8 ± 0.5 and 6.2 ± 0.3 for lev, 7.2 ± 0.1
and 7.0 ± 0.1 for ucb 30889, 7.2 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.1 for ucb
34714, and <3.0 in both cases for  xxxd2466xxx  (mean ± s.d.,
n = 4–6). the similar affinity of these compounds for  xxxg2233xxx  from
crude membranes or solubilized extracts indicates that solubilization does not alter the binding properties of this protein.
to characterize some biochemical properties of the solubilized  xxxg2233xxx , we studied the interactions of the immunopurified
 xxxg2233xxx  protein with other synaptic vesicle proteins previously
shown to be putative partners of this protein.  xxxg2233xxx  has been
reported to co-immunoprecipitate with the synaptic vesicle protein syn i [28,29] and to be part of a multimeric complex [4].
however,  xxxg2233xxx ’s interactions varied with the detergent used for
solubilization [4]. furthermore, our work indicates that these
detergents prevent [3 h]ucb 30889 binding to  xxxg2233xxx , suggesting
that they may alter protein conformation. we had already published in a previous paper the immunopurification of solubilized
 xxxg2233xxx  [21] but did not measure ligand affinity and proteinprotein interactions with this protein. here, we show that the
binding properties of the immunopurified  xxxg2233xxx  were not altered
during the purification procedure. fig. 2c illustrates the competition curve of lev against [3 h]ucb 30889 for immunopurified
 xxxg2233xxx . we obtained a pki of 6.0 ± 0.2 (mean ± s.d., n = 4) with
immunoprecipitated  xxxg2233xxx , which was very similar to the one
observed in the soluble extract (pki of 5.8 ± 0.5). as previously shown [21],  xxxg2233xxx  is the unique binding site of [3 h]ucb
30889 in the brain. it does not bind to sv2b or sv2c isoforms
expressed in cos cells and no specific binding is detected in the
brain of  xxxg2233xxx  knock-out mice. as expected, no specific binding
was detected after immunopurification from ddm-solubilized
brain membranes from  xxxg2233xxx -/- knock-out mice (not shown).
we next performed co-immunoprecipitations of  xxxg2233xxx  and syn
i to ensure that treatment by ddm did not change  xxxg2233xxx  protein partners. specificity of immunopurification procedures was

terminus region (cytoplasmic) of  xxxg2233xxx  (fig. 3b). in both cases,
when the bead pellets were washed with solutions containing
nacl, which are typically used to withdraw any contaminants,
the amount of immunoprecipitated proteins was decreased, or
even removed in the case of syn i (lu). we then considered the

for each  xxxg2233xxx  isoforms was previously verified by western-blots
on  xxxg2233xxx  knock-out mice and by immunohistochemical studies
(not shown). as illustrated in fig. 3a and b,  xxxg2233xxx  and sv2b
interact to each other, in an ionic strength sensitive manner.
moreover, sv2b was co-purified with syn i (fig. 3c), with
a better yield when the antibody against the cytoplasmic part
of syn i was used. we then co-immunoprecipitated the same
complexes from synaptic vesicles preparation (lp2) solubilized
by ddm (fig. 3d). the higher purity of  xxxg2233xxx  in solubilized
lp2 facilitated the co-immunoprecipitation. in that latter case,
we were able to co-purify sv2c, which is almost undetectable
in rat cerebral cortex [17], with  xxxg2233xxx  (fig. 3d).
in this study, we assessed the abilities of various detergents to
solubilise from rat cortical membranes the  xxxg2233xxx  protein, which
is the binding site for the antiepileptic drug  xxxd2466xxx  [21].
detergent solubilization of membrane proteins can give very low
yield of non denaturated proteins [14,22]. therefore, the use of
the radioligand [3 h]ucb 30889 with high affinity for  xxxg2233xxx  provided an essential tool in our attempt to solubilise protein with
binding capacity. several detergents, such as triton x-100, triton x-114 and np-40 interfered with the binding assay and thus
were incompatible. among the others, the highest yield of solubilized binding sites was obtained with ddm. this result was
consistent with western-blot analysis. in fact, ddm is known as
a mild detergent which can be used for solubilization and purification of active transporters, in particular those that possess 12
transmembrane alpha-helices [9,20]. this structure is shared by
the  xxxg2233xxx  protein family [1,10].
in an attempt to increase the yield of protein solubilization,
we showed that a mixture of ddm and chaps, which was also
effective in solubilizing binding sites, did not increase the yield
of  xxxg2233xxx  extraction. moreover, analogues of ddm that possess
different acyl chains, and that are also used for solubilizing transporter proteins [9,13,20], were not better than ddm at solubilizing the binding site. after optimizing the solubilization by ddm,
we confirmed by scatchard analysis that approximately 25% of
 xxxg2233xxx  proteins were extracted from rat cortical membranes and
maintained their binding to [3 h]ucb 30889 under our experimental conditions. comparison between crude membranes and
solubilized  xxxg2233xxx  revealed that the binding characteristics of
[3 h]ucb 30889 were unchanged after detergent extraction. the
pki values for lev and its analogues (ucb 30889 and ucb 34714)
were equivalent before and after solubilization. the stereoselective nature of binding was retained, since the r-enantiomer of
lev ( xxxd2466xxx ) produced no inhibition of binding. radioligand
affinity measured in solubilized samples (kd = 90 ± 37 nm) was
in accordance with the ki value of ucb 30889 (63 ± 5 nm) and to
the affinity obtained for crude homogenates (48 ± 15 nm). this
indicated that the solubilization procedure did not significantly
alter the affinity for the lev binding site and that the conformation of this binding site is probably not modified by detergent
extraction.
using a specific antibody for the amino terminus of  xxxg2233xxx , we
immunopurified  xxxg2233xxx  from the solubilized extract. the specificity of this procedure has already been described elsewhere
[21]. the immunopurified  xxxg2233xxx  still bound to [3 h]ucb 30889.
this interaction was inhibited by lev with a pki value similar to

111

the one obtained with  xxxg2233xxx  in the solubilized extract, indicating
that even after immunopurification, solubilized  xxxg2233xxx  retains its
binding properties. to further verify that solubilization did not
alter the protein and in particular its biochemical properties, we
investigated  xxxg2233xxx  interactions with putative protein partners
like synaptotagmin i [4,27–29]. most of the previous experiments aimed at analysing  xxxg2233xxx  protein partners were performed
using triton-x100 as solubilizing agent [19,27–30], which, as
reported in our study, prevent the binding of lev to  xxxg2233xxx  probably through protein denaturation. we showed here that solubilized  xxxg2233xxx  was immunoprecipitated by two antibodies directed
against syn i, and this latter protein was immunopurified with
an antibody specific for the amino terminus of  xxxg2233xxx , which
reinforced the former result. we also observed that the yield of
co-purification was dependent on the ionic strength, indicating
that the binding of both proteins is electrostatic by nature.
we then observed that  xxxg2233xxx  was immunopurified with sv2b
in solubilized cortical membranes, but also with sv2c in synaptic vesicles purified from rat brain. to our knowledge, this is the
first evidence of an interaction between the three  xxxg2233xxx  isoforms.
only the interaction between  xxxg2233xxx  and sv2b has been already
described [1]. it remains unclear however what is the relevance
of such a link between these proteins, and further experiments
are needed to demonstrate whether  xxxg2233xxx  directly binds to other
 xxxg2233xxx  isoforms or if this interaction is mediated through, for example, syn i.
concerning the lev’s mechanism of action and in particular
the functional relevance of the binding of lev to  xxxg2233xxx , it is
tempting to speculate that it may not involve the interaction
between  xxxg2233xxx  and syn i since both  xxxg2233xxx  and sv2b are copurified with syn i whereas [3 h]ucb 30889 bind only to the
former isoform [21]. some other characteristics of  xxxg2233xxx  and
sv2b are probably responsible for the interaction with lev.
in summary, the successful solubilization of  xxxg2233xxx  protein from rat cerebral cortex using n-dodecyl-␤-d-maltoside is
reported here. solubilization and immunoprecipitation of the
lev binding site identified as  xxxg2233xxx  from rat brain with unmodified binding to lev and derivatives and intact interactions to
protein partners may constitute the first step to gain insight into
structural information and the function of  xxxg2233xxx  and its interaction with synaptic vesicle proteins.
