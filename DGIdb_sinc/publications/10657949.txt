 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) expression is up-regulated in
several types of human cancers and has also been directly
linked to carcinogenesis. to investigate the role of cox-2
in pancreatic cancer, we evaluated cox-2 protein expression in primary human pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n ⍧
23) and matched normal adjacent tissue (n ⍧ 11) by
immunoblot analysis. cox-2 expression was found to be
significantly elevated in the pancreatic tumor specimens
compared with normal pancreatic tissue. to examine
whether the elevated levels of cox-2 protein observed in
pancreatic tumors correlated with the presence of oncogenic
 xxxg1285xxx , we determined the  xxxg1285xxx  mutation status in a subset
of the tumors and corresponding normal tissues. the
presence of oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  did not correlate with the level
of cox-2 protein expressed in the pancreatic adenocarcinomas analyzed. these observations were also confirmed in
a panel of human pancreatic tumor cell lines. furthermore,
in the pancreatic tumor cell line expressing the highest
level of cox-2 (bxpc-3), cox-2 expression was demonstrated to be independent of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. the lack of
correlation between cox-2 and oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  expression
suggests that ras activation may not be sufficient to induce
cox-2 expression in pancreatic tumor cells and that the
aberrant activation of signaling pathways other than ras
may be required for up-regulating cox-2 expression. we
also report that the cox inhibitors  xxxd3259xxx , indomethacin
and ns-398 inhibit cell growth in both cox-2-positive
(bxpc-3) and cox-2-negative (paca-2) pancreatic tumor
cell lines. however, suppression of cell growth by indomethacin and ns-398 was significantly greater in the bxpc-3
cell line compared with the paca-2 cell line (p ⍧ 0.004
and p < 0.001, respectively). in addition, the three cox
inhibitors reduce  xxxd1903xxx  levels in the bxpc-3
cell line. taken together, our data suggest that cox-2 may
play an important role in pancreatic tumorigenesis and

therefore be a promising chemotherapeutic target for the
treatment of pancreatic cancer.

introduction
cancer of the exocrine pancreas is the fourth and fifth leading
cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women, respectively,
in the usa (1). difficulty in achieving early diagnosis as well
as the aggressive nature of this type of cancer contribute to
the low survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer. since
few options exist for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, it is
important to identify potential targets for drug therapy. in an
effort to gain more insight into pancreatic tumorigenesis,
pancreatic tumors have been analyzed at the molecular level
to detect genetic lesions. activating mutations within the
 xxxg1285xxx  gene have been detected in up to 90% of pancreatic
carcinomas, suggesting that activation of the ras pathway
is important in the development of pancreatic cancer (2).
experimental chemotherapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer
patients currently include drugs which target the ras signal
transduction pathway.
multiple lines of evidence suggest that the enzyme cyclooxygenase (cox), specifically cox-2, may be a promising
chemotherapeutic target. for example, epidemiological studies
have shown that prolonged use of aspirin or other non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) can reduce the risk of colon
cancer by 40–50% (3). nsaids also inhibit chemically induced
colon carcinomas in animal model systems (4). since nsaids
are known to inhibit cox, the key enzyme in the conversion
of  xxxd208xxx  to prostaglandins and other eicosanoids,
these studies imply that cox may play a role in carcinogenesis
in addition to its known role in inflammation. two isoforms
of cox, designated cox-1 and cox-2, have been identified.
cox-1 is constitutively expressed whereas cox-2 is induced
by mitogenic stimuli such as serum, phorbol esters and growth
factors (5,6). cox-2 expression has recently been shown to
be elevated in several different types of human cancer, suggesting that the presence of cox-2 correlates with cancer
development (7–11). additional studies which directly link
cox-2 to carcinogenesis include observations that human
colon cancer cells expressing cox-2 acquire increased invasiveness (12) and that cox-2 expressed in intestinal epithelial
cells inhibits apoptosis (13). cox-2 expression in colon cancer
cells has also been found to promote angiogenesis of cocultured endothelial cells by stimulating the production of
angiogenic factors (14). furthermore, direct genetic evidence
linking cox-2 to colorectal tumorigenesis was provided by a
mouse model for human familial adenomatous polyposis, an
inherited condition leading to colorectal cancer; in this system,
cox-2 gene knockouts and a specific cox-2 inhibitor were
found to reduce the number of intestinal polyps formed (15).
the presence of oncogenic ras has been associated with
the induction of cox-2 expression in h-ras-transformed rat
intestinal and mammary epithelial cells as well as in non139

m.t.yip-schneider et al.

small cell lung cancer cell lines (nsclc) (16–18). to our
knowledge, the association between oncogenic ras and
cox-2 expression has not been explored in vivo. the high
frequency of activating mutations within the  xxxg1285xxx  gene in
pancreatic tumors should enable us to investigate the relationship between oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  and cox-2 expression in vivo.
in the present study, we have evaluated cox-2 protein levels
in primary human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. we further
examined whether cox-2 expression correlated with  xxxg1285xxx 
mutation status in pancreatic tumors as well as in pancreatic
cancer cell lines. in light of our data demonstrating elevated
levels of cox-2 protein in primary pancreatic tumors and cell
lines, we tested the effect of the cox inhibitors  xxxd3259xxx ,
indomethacin and ns-398 on cell growth and prostaglandin
e2 production in human pancreatic tumor cell lines.
materials and methods
patient samples
banked tissues were obtained from the indiana university tissue procurement
laboratory and the cooperative human tissue network, which is funded by
the national cancer institute. a total of 23 primary human pancreatic cancer
specimens were analyzed in this study. corresponding matched, normal
adjacent tissue was obtained from 11 of the patients. the patients were
selected on the basis of having no prior chemotherapy. tissues were frozen
in liquid nitrogen within 1 h of surgical removal and subsequently stored at
–80°c. paraffin sections were prepared from a subset of the specimens. all
tumor specimens used in this study were examined by a pathologist and
classified as primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas. institutional review board
approval was obtained for this study.
immunoblots
frozen tissue was briefly homogenized in ripa lysis buffer (phosphatebuffered saline, 1% np40, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% sds, 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, 1 mm na3vo4, 20 mm beta-glycerophosphate,
1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, 20 µg/ml aprotinin and 1 µg/ml
leupeptin). lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13 000 g for 10 min,
followed by boiling in sample buffer. protein concentrations were determined
using the bca protein assay kit (pierce). equivalent amounts of total protein
were resolved by sds–page on 10% gels (novex) and transferred to
immobilon p membranes (msi). the blots were probed with the primary
antibodies cox-1 (c-20; santa cruz biotechnology), cox-2 (c-20; santa
cruz biotechnology),  xxxg1077xxx  (pan-ras ab-3; oncogene science), actin (c-11,
which recognizes a broad range of actin isoforms; santa cruz biotechnology)
or the phospho-specific anti- xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody (new england biolabs) as
recommended by the manufacturers. bands were visualized by ecl
(amersham) and quantitated by densitometry. the amount of cox-2 was
expressed as a percentage of the positive control [3 µg of cell lysate
prepared from the mouse macrophage cell line raw 264.7 stimulated with
lipopolysaccharide (lps)]. specific recognition of cox-1 and cox-2, respectively, by the anti-cox-1 and anti-cox-2 antibodies was confirmed by peptide
inhibition experiments (data not shown).
immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemical staining was performed on 5 µm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using the avidin–biotin complex technique (19). primary
polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; oxford biomedical research inc., oxford,
mi) was used for evaluation of cox-2 expression. 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine
was used as the chromogen and 0.2% methyl green was used as the
counterstain. positive and negative controls were run in parallel and gave
appropriate results.
 xxxg1285xxx  mutation analysis
genomic dna was prepared by incubating the tissue in lysis buffer (50 mm
tris, ph 8.0, 100 mm edta, 100 mm nacl, 1% sds, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase
k) overnight at 55°c. rnase (0.1 mg/ml) was added and the incubation was
continued for 2 h at 37°c. the sample was then extracted with phenol and
phenol:chloroform, and ethanol precipitated.  xxxg1285xxx  exon 1 of the resuspended
genomic dna (0.5 µg) was amplified by pcr (5⬘ primer, 5⬘-atgactgaatataaacttgt-3⬘; 3⬘ primer, 5⬘-ctctattgttggatcatatt-3⬘) (20).
 xxxg1285xxx  mutation-specific oligonucleotides (oncogene research products) were
utilized to detect mutations at  xxxg1285xxx  codon 12 in the pcr-amplified products
by dot blot hybridization (21). mutations at  xxxg1285xxx  codon 13 were detected by
sequencing the purified pcr amplification products.

fig. 1. representative immunoblot of pancreatic adenocarcinomas and
matched normal tissue. lysates were prepared from tumor (t) specimens
obtained from six patients, three with matched normal (n) tissue (sample
numbers correspond to those listed in table i). lysates were analyzed by
immunoblotting with specific cox-2, cox-1,  xxxg1077xxx  and actin antibodies as
indicated. the positive control (⫹) for the cox-2 immunoblot is a cell
lysate prepared from lps-treated mouse macrophage cell line raw 264.7.
the negative control (–) is the colon carcinoma cell line hct 116, which
expresses neither cox-1 nor cox-2.

statistical analysis
the presence of a statistically significant elevation of cox-2 protein between
cancer specimens and corresponding normal adjacent tissues was determined
by the non-parametric signed rank test. a two-way analysis of variance was
used to examine the difference in mean percent cell growth between the
bxpc-3 and paca-2 cell lines in the presence of the cox inhibitors.
cell lines
the human pancreatic tumor cell lines (aspc-1, bxpc-3, capan-1, capan-2,
hpaf-ii, hs766t, paca-2 and panc-1) were obtained from the american
type culture collection (atcc, rockville, md) and cultured as recommended.
the hamster pancreatic cell lines (d27, d27/ xxxg1285xxx  and b12/13) were cultured
as described previously (22,23). for the inhibitor studies, bxpc-3 cells were
treated with the map kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  (40 µm) or
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) for 10 h. lysates were prepared and analyzed as
described above.
cell growth
cells were plated in duplicate in 6-well plates in the presence of dmso,
 xxxd3259xxx  (sigma), indomethacin (sigma) or ns-398 (biomol). on day 3, cells
were trypsinized, stained with trypan blue and counted using a hemocytometer.
cell growth was determined by averaging the cell counts and expressed as a
percentage of the number of cells in the dmso control samples.
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) assay
cells were plated in 12-well plates. on day 3, the culture medium was
aspirated and replaced with 15 µm  xxxd208xxx  in serum-free medium
for 1 h prior to assaying the culture supernatant for pge2 by enzyme
immunoassay (biotrak; amersham) as recommended by the manufacturer.
the amount of pge2 produced was normalized to protein concentration.
intracellular pge2 levels were determined by plating cells in 12-well plates
in the presence of the cox inhibitors for 24 h followed by cell lysis and
quantitation by enzyme immunoassay (biotrak) as recommended by the
manufacturer. for determination of intracellular pge2 levels, the cells were
not preincubated with  xxxd208xxx  prior to assay.

results
cox-2 expression in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas
the expression of cox-2 protein was examined in primary
human pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n ⫽ 23) and matched
normal adjacent pancreatic tissue (n ⫽ 11) by immunoblot
analysis. a representive immunoblot of lysates prepared from
six patients, three with matched normal tissue lysates, is
shown in figure 1. undetectable levels of cox-2 protein were
observed in each of the normal specimens. in contrast, cox-

cox-2 expression in pancreatic cancer

and cox-2-negative samples were defined as those samples
with percent cox-2 expression greater or less than 5%,
respectively, which corresponds closely with visual detection
in the immunoblots. according to these criteria, six of 11
(55%) tumor samples in the matched tissue sets were cox2-positive. similarly, 13 of the 23 (56%) total tumor specimens
analyzed were cox-2-positive; in contrast, all the normal
tissue samples (n ⫽ 11) were cox-2-negative.
immunohistochemical staining of the pancreatic tumor specimens demonstrated that cox-2 expression was localized to
the carcinoma cells and was not detectable in the stromal
compartment of the tumors (figure 3).

fig. 2. percent cox-2 expression in patient samples. values of percent
cox-2 expression for all tumor samples, shown by solid circles, and
normal tissue, shown by open circles, from table i are plotted. values for
mean, median and range are indicated. the percent cox-2 expression for
the matched pancreatic tumor/normal tissue sets is shown in the inset
(n ⫽ 11). lines are drawn between the corresponding tumor values, shown
by solid circles, and normal values, shown by the open circles. the
difference in cox-2 expression between tumor and normal specimens was
determined to be statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.004).

2 protein expression in the pancreatic tumor tissues ranged
from undetectable (sample 21) to slight/moderate (samples 12,
14 and 20) to high levels (samples 9 and 22). cox-1 protein
was observed in both pancreatic tumor and normal tissues,
although the level of expression was variable and not consistently elevated in the tumor specimens (figure 1). similar
levels of  xxxg1077xxx  and actin expression were found in both the
tumor and corresponding normal tissues (figure 1).
the percent cox-2 expression was determined for all the
tissue specimens by performing densitometric analysis and
calculated relative to the positive control set equal to 100%
(table i and figure 2). the positive control for our studies
was the mouse macrophage cell line raw 264.7 stimulated
with lps, previously shown to induce cox-2 expression (24).
a wide range (0–93%) of cox-2 expression was found in the
pancreatic adenocarcinomas versus a much narrower range
(0–4.3%) of cox-2 expression in the normal tissues. both
mean and median cox-2 expression were higher in the tumor
samples, suggesting that cox-2 expression is elevated in
pancreatic adenocarcinomas compared with normal tissue. the
difference in cox-2 expression between the pancreatic tumor
and corresponding normal tissue was determined to be statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.004) (figure 2, inset). cox-2-positive

cox-2 expression and  xxxg1285xxx  mutation in pancreatic tumors
and cell lines
to determine if cox-2 expression levels correlated with the
 xxxg1285xxx  mutation status of the tumors, genomic dna was
isolated from a subset of the tissue specimens and screened
for the presence of  xxxg1285xxx  mutations at codon 12 by allelespecific hybridization of pcr-amplified  xxxg1285xxx  exon 1 products.
specimens which lacked a mutation at codon 12 were subsequently sequenced to search for the presence of  xxxg1285xxx 
mutations at codon 13 (table i). all of the normal tissues
analyzed were wild-type at codon 12 (ggt ⫽ gly) and codon
13 (ggc ⫽ gly). of the 13 pancreatic cancer specimens
analyzed, one specimen had a mutation at codon 13 whereas
10 samples were mutated at codon 12, corresponding to a
 xxxg1285xxx  mutation frequency of 85%. there did not appear to be
a direct correlation between  xxxg1285xxx  mutation and the extent
of cox-2 protein expression. for example, some samples
expressed high levels of cox-2 protein and possessed a
mutation in  xxxg1285xxx  (tumor samples 9, 16, and 22), however,
other samples which had mutated  xxxg1285xxx  expressed little or no
cox-2 protein (tumor samples 3, 17, 18, 19, and 21).
similarly, no direct correlation between the expression of
activated  xxxg1285xxx  and cox-2 was observed in a panel of
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines with known
 xxxg1285xxx  mutation status (25,26). both the frequency and variability in the quantity of cox-2 expressed in the pancreatic tumor
cell lines reflected our findings in the primary pancreatic
adenocarcinomas. of the eight human pancreatic tumor cell
lines analyzed, only three of the seven cell lines expressing
oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  exhibited detectable levels of cox-2 protein
(capan-1, capan-2 and hpaf-ii) (figure 4a). high levels of
cox-2 protein were also observed in the wild-type k-rasexpressing cell line bxpc-3, which displays high levels of
ras-independent raf activity (26). treatment of the bxpc-3
cell line with the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  significantly reduced
the level of active, phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 but had no effect
on the amount of cox-2 protein synthesized, suggesting that
cox-2 expression is independent of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation (figure
4b). taken together, our results suggest that activation of the
ras pathway is not sufficient to mediate cox-2 up-regulation
in pancreatic tumor cells.
we also compared the level of cox-2 expression in three
hamster pancreatic cell lines. the d27/ xxxg1285xxx  and b12/13
transformed cell lines were derived from the non-malignant
hamster pancreatic duct cell line d27 by transfection with
oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  or treatment with chemical carcinogens
in vitro, respectively (22,23). although both the d27/ xxxg1285xxx 
and b12/13 cell lines harbor oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx , only the b12/
13 cells showed elevated levels of cox-2 protein compared
with the d27 parental line (figure 4c). these results confirm
141

m.t.yip-schneider et al.

fig. 3. immunohistochemical staining of pancreatic tumor tissue. some but not all of the tumor cells are positive for cox-2 (brown reaction product)
whereas the surrounding stroma is negative (⫻200).

our conclusion that ras activation alone is not sufficient to
up-regulate cox-2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells and
suggest that additional events which occur following exposure
to chemical carcinogens may be required.
to examine whether cox-2 expression could be induced
in the human pancreatic cancer cell lines, four cell lines were
serum starved and subsequently treated with 10% fetal calf
serum (fcs) for various time periods (figure 4d). in the
cox-2-positive bxpc-3 and capan-1 cell lines, cox-2 was
still detectable following serum starvation, although at lower
levels than in exponentially growing cells. cox-2 expression
was inducible in these cell lines following fcs stimulation.
in contrast, cox-2 expression could not be induced by serum
treatment in either of the cox-2-negative cell lines, aspc-1
and paca-2. under these treatment conditions,  xxxg1369xxx /2 is
activated (unpublished observations), again demonstrating that
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation is not sufficient to induce cox-2 expression
in the cox-2-negative pancreatic tumor cells. we observed
similar results upon treating the cell lines with the tumor
promoter  xxxd2925xxx  (pma) (unpublished
observations).
treatment of pancreatic tumor cell lines with cyclooxygenase
inhibitors
the cox-2-positive human pancreatic tumor cell line bxpc-3
and the cox-2-negative cell line paca-2 were treated with
the cox inhibitor  xxxd3259xxx , indomethacin, or ns-398.  xxxd3259xxx 
and indomethacin are non-selective cox inhibitors, inhibiting
both cox-1 and cox-2 (27), whereas ns-398 is a more
specific inhibitor of cox-2 (28). the effect of the cox
inhibitors on cell growth was measured after 3 days of
treatment (figure 5). all three inhibitors were found to suppress
cell growth in both pancreatic tumor cell lines in a dosedependent manner. however, indomethacin and ns-398 were
found to inhibit cell growth to a greater extent in the cox-2expressing cell line bxpc-3 compared with the paca-2 cell
line (p ⫽ 0.004 and p ⬍ 0.001, respectively). no significant
142

difference in cell growth inhibition was observed between the
two cell lines with  xxxd3259xxx  treatment (p ⫽ 0.333).
to evaluate the functional activity of cox-2 in the human
pancreatic tumor cell lines, pge2 production was measured
by enyzyme immunoassay (figure 6a). pge2 production was
elevated in the bxpc-3, capan-1, capan-2 and hpaf-ii cell
lines, correlating with the increased level of cox-2 expressed
in these cell lines. in contrast, barely detectable levels of pge2
were detected in the cox-2-negative pancreatic cell lines. to
determine the effect of the cox inhibitors on pge2 production,
the cox-2-positive cell line bxpc-3 was incubated with
two different concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  (100 and 250 µm),
indomethacin (10 and 100 µm) or ns-398 (10 and 50 µm)
for 24 h prior to measuring intracellular pge2 levels (figure
6b). intracellular pge2 rather than pge2 secreted into the
growth medium was measured since intracellular levels should
be more sensitive to changes in response to the inhibitor
treatments. the two concentrations of the various cox inhibitors were evaluated in the cell growth assays described above
(figure 5), with the higher concentration corresponding to the
ic50 values of the cox inhibitors. at the lower concentrations,
both ns-398 and indomethacin inhibited pge2 production, by
75 and 95%, respectively; in contrast,  xxxd3259xxx  at the lower
concentration did not affect pge2 levels. nevertheless, all
three inhibitors at the higher ic50 concentrations substantially
suppressed intracellular pge2 levels, by between 86 and 98%,
in the bxpc-3 cell line. these data suggest that the cox
inhibitors may exert their effects in the cox-2-positive bxpc-3
cell line at least in part by decreasing pge2 production.
however, in the cox-2-negative cell lines, the effects of
the cox inhibitors may be mediated by cox- and pge2independent mechanisms.
discussion
in resting cells, the expression of cox-2 is usually undetectable
but can be rapidly induced by mitogenic stimuli as well as

inflammatory agents (5,6,29). recent studies have shown that
cox-2 expression is up-regulated in a variety of human
cancers, including colon, lung, gastric, pancreatic and esophageal (7–11). in the present study, we report that elevated
levels of cox-2 protein are expressed in human pancreatic
tumors compared with barely detectable levels in the matched
normal pancreatic tissue, suggesting that increased expression
of cox-2 protein correlates with pancreatic tumorigenesis.
our results confirm a recent report demonstrating up-regulation
of cox-2 rna and protein in pancreatic tumors and localization of cox-2 in malignant epithelial cells (11). an earlier
study demonstrated that the expression of group ii  xxxg1759xxx , which catalyzes the release of  xxxd208xxx  from
membrane phospholipids, was higher in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinomas compared with normal pancreatic tissue (30).
in addition, the development of n-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine-initiated pancreatic tumors in hamsters was inhibited
by the administration of two prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors,
phenylbutazone and indomethacin (31). together with our
observations in vivo and in vitro, these studies suggest that
increased prostaglandin production due to increased expression

of cox-2 may be an important event in the multi-step
progression towards pancreatic tumor formation.
recent studies have suggested that ras activation may induce
cox-2 expression in several systems. activated, oncogenic
h-ras was inducibly expressed in rat-1 fibroblasts with a
concomitant increase in cox-2 expression as well as pge2
production (32). in this particular cell line, a specific mek
inhibitor,  xxxd1169xxx , was found to suppress cox-2 induction
by oncogenic ras, suggesting that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation is required
for ras-dependent induction of cox-2. similarly, elevated
levels of cox-2 as well as pge2 were detected in rastransformed mammary epithelial cells (c57/mg) cells (17). in
human nsclc cell lines expressing oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx ,
increased pge2 production was mediated by constitutively
high expression of cytosolic  xxxg1759xxx  and cox-2
compared with nsclc lines without ras mutations (18). in
the present study, we addressed the question of whether the
expression of oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  correlated with increased
cox-2 expression in primary human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. we found that the presence of a mutation at codon 12
or 13 in the  xxxg1285xxx  gene did not correlate with the expression

(b) activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and cox-2 expression levels following treatment of

phosphorylated, active  xxxg1369xxx /2 was detected with a phospho-specific antierk1/2 antibody. (c) comparison of cox-2 expression in three hamster
pancreatic cell lines. d27 is the non-malignant, parental cell line from
which the d27/ xxxg1285xxx  and b12/13 transformed lines were derived. after
probing for cox-2, the blot was stripped and re-probed for actin to
demonstrate equivalent protein loading. (d) inducibility of cox-2
expression. serum-starved cells were stimulated with 10% fcs for the
indicated times followed by cell lysis. expression of cox-2 was
determined in lysates prepared from growing (gr), serum-starved (0 h) and
fcs-stimulated cells by immunoblot analysis.

of detectable levels of cox-2 protein. a possible explanation
for the lack of cox-2 expression in a subset of the tumors
with oncogenic ras is that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity may be downregulated in pancreatic carcinomas (26). moreover, even in
the two pancreatic tumor samples which did show elevated
levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (samples 4 and 21; data not shown),
only low levels of cox-2 were detected in the present study,
suggesting that  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation alone is not sufficient to
induce cox-2 expression. these findings suggest that within
the tumor environment, the presence of oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx 
does not directly result in increased cox-2 expression in
pancreatic cancer.
similar conclusions were also reached upon analysis of
pancreatic cancer cell lines, which were examined since they
represent a homogeneous population of cells as opposed to
primary tumor tissue, which is heterogeneous. despite activating  xxxg1285xxx  mutations in seven of the eight lines, only three of
the lines with mutated  xxxg1285xxx  expressed detectable amounts of
cox-2 protein. cox-2 expression was also elevated in the

lines. the cell lines bxpc-3, shown by the black bars, and paca-2, shown
by the hatched bars, were plated in the presence of dmso (control) or the
indicated concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  (a), indomethacin (b) or ns-398 (c).

wild-type  xxxg1285xxx  bxpc-3 cell line, which possesses high levels
of active raf (26). cox-2 was constitutively expressed in the
four cox-2-positive cell lines; in contrast, cox-2 expression
could not be induced by serum or pma in the cox-2-negative
cell lines, suggesting that cox-2 expression is blocked in
these cells. cox-2 expression in the bxpc-3 cell line was not
reduced following treatment with the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx ,
suggesting that cox-2 induction is independent of ras pathway activation in this cell line. differential expression of
cox-2 protein in the transformed hamster pancreatic cell lines
generated by either transfection with oncogenic ras or treatment
with chemical carcinogens further demonstrated that ras
activation does not appear to be sufficient to mediate the
induction of cox-2 expression. activation of other signaling
pathways in addition to ras may cooperate to determine the
extent of cox-2 expression in cancer cells. such pathways
may include the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase which
has been reported to regulate the induction of cox-2 in lpstreated human monocytes (33). furthermore, in human vascular
endothelial cells, the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  p65 was found
to mediate the induction of cox-2 in response to hypoxia
(34). thus, the induction of cox-2 expression appears to
be mediated by multiple signaling pathways. the specific
pathway(s) activated may depend upon the cell type as well

cox-2 expression in pancreatic cancer

pge2 levels. no pge2 was detectable in the non-cox-2expressing cell lines. these data suggest that the cox inhibitors
exert their inhibitory effects by both cox/pge2-dependent
and -independent pathways in pancreatic tumor cell lines. ns398 has been previously shown to inhibit cell proliferation by
inducing apoptosis in a cox-2-independent fashion (35).
similarly,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, a metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx  which
does not inhibit cox activity, was found to inhibit colon
carcinogenesis in a rat model without decreasing prostaglandin
levels (36). furthermore, in cox null embryo fibroblasts,
transformation as well as the antiproliferative and antineoplastic actions of nsaids were recently shown to be independent of cox expression (37).
the detection of elevated levels of cox-2 in a variety of
human cancers combined with the chemopreventative effect
of nsaids in colon cancer demonstrate that cox-2 may
be an important participant in carcinogenesis. the reported
biological consequences of cox-2 up-regulation include
inhibition of apoptosis (13), increased metastatic potential
(12) and promotion of angiogenesis (14). these events may
contribute to cell transformation and tumor progression. we
report that cox-2 expression was noticeably elevated in 55%
of the patient pancreatic tumor samples analyzed, identifying
cox-2 as a promising new target for chemotherapy. our
results demonstrating the ability of cox inhibitors to inhibit
pancreatic tumor cell growth and pge2 production in vitro
suggest that nsaids may be effective in the treatment of
pancreatic cancer patients, for whom few treatment options
currently exist. whether cox-2 expression can be employed
as a prognostic or diagnostic tool is also an important issue
which remains to be investigated.

delineate which signaling pathways are functional in pancreatic
tumor cells.
cell growth was inhibited by treatment with the cox
inhibitors  xxxd3259xxx , indomethacin and ns-398 in both cox2-positive (bxpc-3) and cox-2-negative (paca-2) cell lines.
however, the cell line bxpc-3 was significantly more sensitive
to growth inhibition by indomethacin and ns-398 compared
with the paca-2 cell line, suggesting that these two compounds
may be more selective for cox-2-expressing cells than  xxxd3259xxx . furthermore, in the bxpc-3 cell line, the cox inhibitors
at ic50 concentrations substantially decreased intracellular
