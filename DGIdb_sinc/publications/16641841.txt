needs assessment
despite evidence of antidepressant efficacy, the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors has declined due to concerns about food and drug interactions. to overcome
these problems, the selegiline transdermal system (sts) was developed with novel
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. sts represents an advance over
older monoamine oxidase inhibitors because it can be used as an antidepressant
with minimal dietary modifications. sts may have an important therapeutic role in
major depressive disorder.

review article

leads to sustained plasma concentrations of the

advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(ssris), maois were relegated to third- or even
fourth-line treatment.
nevertheless, the efficacy of maois, in particular for atypical and treatment-resistant depresssion (trd) subtypes, has sustained interest in this
class of drugs. recently, there have been renewed
efforts to develop better-tolerated maois leading to the introduction of reversible inhibitors
of mao isoenzyme a (rima), such as moclobemide, and a transdermal formulation of selegiline
that targets brain mao while initially bypassing
gastrointestinal (gl) mao. while moclobemide is
marketed in several countries, it will not become
available in the united states in the foreseeable
future. therefore, this review will focus on critically evaluating the pharmacology, efficacy, and
safety data for the selegiline transdermal system
(sts) that was introduced in the us in 2006.the
purpose of this review is to help clinicians make
informed decisions about the appropriate use of
new maois for the treatment of depression.

parent compound, increasing the amount of drug
delivered to the brain and decreasing metabolite production. in addition, sts allows targeted
inhibition of central nervous system monoamine
a (mao-a) and monoamine b isoenzymes with
minimal effects on mao-a in the gastrointestinal and hepatic systems, thereby reducing the
risk of interactions with tyramine-rich foods (the
"cheese-reaction"). clinical trials have found 6
mg/24 hours of sts to be effective in mdd without the need for dietary restrictions. the efficacy
and safety profile of sts supports its use in mdd.
it is possible that sts may demonstrate benefit in
mdd with atypical features or mdd resistant to
other antidepressants. however, more research is
needed. clinicians should familiarize themselves
with the properties and indications for the new
generation of maois.

the monoamine oxidase enzyme system
mao is one of the most important enzymes in
neurotransmitter metabolism.the human mao
system consists of two isoforms designated mao
isoenzyme a (mao-a) and isoenzyme b ( xxxg1358xxx ).6the ratio of mao-a to mao-b in the human
brain is 25%:75%, in the liver is 50%:50%, in the
intestine is 80%:20%, and in the peripheral adrenergic neurons (adrenal glands, arterial vessels,
and sympathetic nerve) is 90%:10%.78 mao-a
preferentially metabolizes serotonin (5-ht) and
norepinephrine (ne) and is inhibited by  xxxd1730xxx . mao-b preferentially metabolizes phenylethylamine and  xxxd314xxx  and is inhibited by
selegiline. dopamine and tyramine are metabolized equally by both isoforms.7 within the human
brain, mao-a is found in the locus ceruleus and
reticular formation, regions that contain a high
density of catecholaminergic neurons. mao-a is
also present in the presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons. in contrast, mao-b is abundant in the dorsal raphe nucleus, which is rich
in 5-ht neurons. mao-b is also found in basal
ganglia, primarily within glial cells, that contain
dopamine neurons.9 mao metabolizes exogenous amines, such as dietary tyramine, and regulates neurotransmitter levels.10

introduction
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) are
an important class of antidepressants that have
been used for over 40 years. iproniazid, an inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (mao),
was originally synthesized as an antituberculosis
agent and ushered in the era of antidepressant
development.12 by the early 1960s, maois were
successfully established as antidepressants. 3
these agents included the hydrazine derivatives
phenelzine and  xxxd2389xxx  and the nonhydrazine drug tranylcypromine. however, in the early
1960s, iproniazid was withdrawn from the market due to reports of hepatotoxicity.
by the mid-1960s, there were over 40 reports of
hypertensive crisis associated with maois, most
commonly with tranylcypromine.these episodes
often followed ingestion of tyramine-rich cheese,
hence the term "the cheese reaction."45the food
and drug administration revised the labeling
for maois to include extensive dietary restrictions. although this dramatically reduced the
incidence of hypertensive crises, most patients
found the dietary restrictions inconvenient. when
tricylic antidepressants (tcas) rapidly gained
acceptance, the use of maois declined. with the

irreversibility and nonselectivity
irreversible and nonselective
monoamine oxidase inhibitors:
phenelzine and tranylcypromine

moclobemide was the first rima to be approved
as an antidepressant in europe and is available in
over 50 countries, excluding the us.14 moclobemide
is better tolerated than the older maois and is seldom associated with hypertensive crisis because it
is readily displaced from its binding site on mao-a
by tyramine.16 however, questions remain regarding
efficacy of moclobemide compared with the older
maois.16 a meta-analysis11 found that there was a
clinically significant advantage for the older maois
(13.3%) over moclobemide. it is hypothesized1 that
mao inhibition by reversible maois is less profound and sustained compared with the irreversible
maois, which may explain the possible efficacy differences. despite a more favorable tolerability profile, rimas have not yet established a strong track
record as a preferred treatment for depression.17

many of the problems associated with older
maois, such as tranylcypromine and phenelzine,
result from two pharmacologic characteristics:
irreversibility and nonselectivity. irreversibility
refers to the tenacious binding of the drug to
the mao enzyme essentially for the lifetime of
the molecule (ie, 14-28 days).11 thus, even high
concentration of substrate cannot displace an
irreversible maoi from the enzyme. therefore,
normally insignificant concentrations of vasopressors, such as tyramine, can be dangerous
when ingested with an irreversible maoi.
nonselectivity refers to the tendency of a drug
to bind both the a and b isoenzymes.12 several
maois with selectivity toward either mao-a or
mao-b have been developed.table 1 lists the various maois that have been clinically tested. one
of the earliest selective maois to be identified
was the irreversible mao-a inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx .13
however,  xxxd1730xxx  had the liability to cause
hypertensive crisis with high concentrations of
tyramine despite its selectivity.to address these
limitations, rimas were developed.

selective  xxxg1358xxx 
inhibitors: selegiline
the accessibility of the blood platelets that
contain mao-b for research facilitated the identification of selective mao-b inhibitors, such as
selegiline. at low oral doses (5-10 mg/day), selegiline inhibits >90% of brain mao-b while avoid-

ing inhibition of gl mao-a, eliminating the need
for dietary restrictions.1819 at doses >20 mg/day,
selegiline loses its selectivity. oral selegiline in
low doses (5-10 mg/day) has been approved for
the adjunctive treatment of parkinson's disease
without any dietary restrictions.2021
to date, clinical trials2224 have  xxxd3237xxx 
oral selegiline as a potent antidepressant at doses
selective for mao-b inhibition (5-10 mg/day).
the best evidence for antidepressant efficacy
comes from trials25'27 employing larger, nonselective doses (20-60 mg/day) that required dietary
restrictions.this suggests that inhibition of  xxxg1357xxx  alone or in combination with mao-b is critical
to the antidepressant response.28
oral selegiline undergoes extensive first-pass
metabolism by the hepatic cytochrome p450 system. desmethylselegiline,  xxxd2589xxx ,
and  xxxd163xxx  are the main metabolites.
there is concern that the metabolites with the
oral formulation may be associated with cardiovascular side effects and neurotoxicity.29
a freeze-dried, orally disintegrating form of
selegiline has been developed. it is absorbed
through the buccal mucosa directly into the systemic circulation3031 and seems to be better tolerated than the conventional formulation and
less sensitive to a tyramine challenge.29 orally
disintegrating selegiline 1.25-2.5 mg/day has
been demonstrated to have short-term efficacy
as adjunctive treatment for parkinson's disease.
however, its antidepressant efficacy remains to
be evaluated.
rasagiline is a selective, irreversible mao-b
inhibitor that is 10-15 times more potent than
selegiline. unlike selegiline, it does not give rise
to methamphetamine metabolites nor does it
have the sympathomimetic activity of selegiline.32
while it is effective in the treatment of parkinson's
disease,33 its antidepressant efficacy has not been
investigated in controlled trials.

consequences can be a severe hypertensive reaction that typically occurs within 10 minutes and
can last up to 2 hours after a meal.37
therefore, dietary restrictions are required for
patients receiving older maois. extensive dietary
restrictions were previously recommended, however, due to changes in food processing and more
reliable analytical methods, newer recommendations are less restrictive.38the tyramine content
of foods varies due to the differences in processing. large quantities of tyramine are formed if
products are aged, fermented, or spoiled. because
the cheese reaction is dose-related, it can be minimized without the complete avoidance of tyramine-containing foods.

development of selegiline
transdermal system
from an antidepressant efficacy and safety
standpoint, the ideal maoi should inhibit brain
mao-a and mao-b but not gl mao-a. oral
selegiline suffers from the limitations of loss of
selectivity for mao-b at antidepressant doses,
thereby introducing the need for dietary restrictions. recent advances in drug-delivery systems
have permitted systemic delivery of a drug via
transdermal route.
sts has been developed with novel pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. it utilizes selegiline as an amine base embedded in an

the "cheese reaction" occurs when food and

mao-a is inhibited by at least 80%, tyramine is
not metabolized, able to enter the circulatory system, and cause a significant release of ne from

a controlled rate by the components in the matrix
so that a steady plasma-drug level is maintained.39
sts has undergone extensive evaluation in
humans.these studies40-41 have found that sts
offers sustained plasma concentrations, minimal
peak-trough fluctuations, higher bioavailability,
and reduced concentration of metabolites. sts
allows inhibition of brain mao-a and mao-b
enzymes with reduced effects on gl mao-a,
thereby reducing the risk of possible interactions
with tyramine-rich foods at therapeutic doses.
the prolonged duration of action with sts permits the lower frequency of administration and
possibly improved patient compliance.1

compared with 4.4% after oral administration due
to first-pass metabolism.therefore, sts produces
higher and more sustained steady-state levels
compared with oral selegiline. figure 243 shows
differences in plasma concentrations with oral
selegiline 10 mg/day versus sts 6 mg/24 hours.
protein binding is ~90% and it rapidly penetrates
the central nervous sytem. selegiline is metabolized by multiple cytochrome p450 isoenzymes
2c9, 2b6, 3a4/5 to form /v-desmethylselegiline
or r-methamphetamine. both these metabolites
can be further transformed into r-amphetamine.
the increase in selegiline concentration after sts
compared with oral administration occurs with a
70% reduction in the formation of amphetaminelike metabolites that may be associated with toxic
effects on brain neurochemistry and behavior.44'45
the pharmacokinetics of sts does not seem to
be significantly influenced by gender, renal function, or mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
table 2 describes the pharmacokinetics of sts.

pharmacokinetics of selegiline
transdermal system
over 30 human pharmacokinetics studies42
have examined dermally applied selegiline in
over 650 subjects. sts is extensively absorbed
through the skin with plasma levels maintained
over a 24-hour period permitting once-daily application. about 25% to 30% of selegiline in sts is
delivered within 24 hours. selegiline delivered
by 20 mg/20 cm 2 , 30 mg/30 cm 2 , and 40 mg/40
cm2 sts approximates 6 mg, 9 mg, and 12 mg
over 24 hours, respectively. steady-state levels
are reached after 5 days of sts treatment.23the
bioavailability of selegiline is -75% following sts

pharmacodynamics of
selegiline transpermal system
studies46 have shown that selegiline doses that
produce at least 70% inhibition of brain mao-a
and 90% inhibition of brain mao-b predict antidepressant activity. sts also was 10-20 times more
potent than oral selegiline in producing its antidepressant-like effect and inhibiting cortical mao-a.10
animal studies 24 have demonstrated that
doses of sts that inhibit activities of both  xxxg1357xxx  and mao-b in the brain by >90% only partially
inhibit gl enzyme activities, with a maximal

bition of mao-b. in addition, doses of sts that
inhibit brain mao-a and mao-b by 60% and 90%,
respectively, do not alter gl mao-a activity.this
supports a targeted effect of sts on the brain
versus the periphery (figure 3).1024 because >80%
inhibition of gl mao-a is necessary to affect the
ability of the enzyme to catabolize tyramine, sts
6 mg/24 hours does not seem to significantly
impair tyramine metabolism in the gut.

tyramine challenge tests
tyramine is a vasopressor and can produce clinically significant increases in blood pressure (>30
mmhg) in healthy volunteers at extremely high
doses (~1 gram/meal). 4849 about 2-3 times more
tyramine is required with food compared with
fasting condition to induce a pressor response.
tyramine pressor sensitivity to sts 6 mg/24 hours
and 12 mg/24 hours has been investigated under
both fasting and fed conditions. studies4849 have
found that, on average, at least 200 mg of tyramine in fasting state (well above the content of a
tyramine-rich meal, which is 40 mg) was necessary to produce a 30 mm increase in blood pressure. in contrast, as little as 10-25 mg of tyramine
can produce a 30 mm increase in blood pressure
with tranylcypromine. 49 ' 50 even with long-term
sts 6 mg/24 hours treatment, there is only a
slight increase in tyramine sensitivity compared

figure 3 .

effect of sts at steady-state on  xxxg1357xxx  inhibition* 42

with that seen with oral selegiline 10 mg/day.51
the results of tyramine challenge studies48'50
suggest that sts 6 mg/24 hours is equivalent to
oral selegiline 10 mg/day in pressor responses at
10 days and is -20 times less sensitive than tranylcypromine. doses of sts 12 mg/24 hours are ~4
times less sensitive than tranylcypromine. with
sts 6 mg/24 hours, it seems virtually impossible
that an individual can consume sufficient amounts
of tyramine-rich food to produce a hypertensive
crisis. even at 12 mg/24 hours, the mean pressor
dose (172±92 mg/24 hours) in the fed state represents >4 times the amount in a tyramine-rich meal.
however, the most sensitive subject had a pressor dose of tyramine 75 mg. given individual variabilities in tyramine sensitivity and unusual dietary
habits, dietary modifications are required with sts
9 mg/24 hours and 12 mg/24 hours. mccabe and
gurley52 reviewed tyramine content of over 360
samples in >17 food categories and could identify
only seven items (mostly aged or fermented cheese,
meat, or fish products) that, when consumed in
large amounts (>5 servings at a time), could reach
the mean tyramine threshold in the fed state that
may produce a pressor effect with 12 mg/24 hours.
the lists of food to avoid are available in local pharmacies and are shown intable 3.63
consistent with these findings, phase iii trials42
of >2,500 patients exposed to sts 6 mg, 9 mg, and
12 mg over 24 hours without dietary modifications
revealed no episodes of hypertensive crises. oral
selegiline has been used to treat parkinson's disease without dietary restrictions since 1989 with
>1.5 million patient exposures. pharmacovigilance
data from 199742 found that the rate of hypertensive crisis per 100,000 exposure years was 1.56 for
oral selegiline compared with 43.36 for tranylcypromine. of the four reported events, three were
not tyramine related and possibly due to interactions with multiple dopaminergic drugs.

review article

due to the limited number of subjects exposed
in these two studies, sympathomimetic drugs
are contraindicated with sts.
another potentially life-threatening complication of maoi therapy is the development of
serotonin syndrome characterized by confusion, fever, diaphoresis, ataxia, or diarrhea.the
most common drug combinations that cause
serotonin syndrome are maois with ssris,
tryptophan,tcas, or meperidine (opioids).56
this syndrome is rare. since 1950, -225 cases
of serotonin syndrome have been reported and
have included cases due to non-maol drug
combinations.57the syndrome is usually mild
and, if managed with drug withdrawal and supportive therapy, generally improves within 24
hours.67 as in the case of older maois, these
agents are contraindicated during sts treatment.
a survey of 47 investigators involved in the
parkinsons study group58 found that of the
4,568 patients treated with a combination of oral
selegiline and an antidepressant (commonly
an ssri), 11 (0.24%) experienced symptoms

possibly consistent with serotonin syndrome.
only two (0.04%) had serious symptoms.there
were no fatalities.58 currently, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether sts has a
decreased risk to induce the serotonin syndrome
in depressed patients.therefore, it is prudent to
observe a minimum washout period equal to 5
half-lives (~1 week with all antidepressants, 5
weeks with fluoxetine) when switching from an
antidepressant to an maoi and to allow at least
2 weeks of washout when switching from an
maoi to an ssri.
comprehensive data are not available for drug
interactions with sts.therefore, sts should not
be used in combination with several drugs that
affect monoamine activity for at least 2 weeks
after discontinuation of sts.table 4 provides a
list of contraindicated medications with sts.

review article

ble-blind, placebo-controlled trials and one
maintenance trial. 475961 four trials compared a
fixed-dose of sts (6 mg/24 hours) while one
study62 had a flexible-dosing strategy (sts 6-12
mg/24 hours). in the pivotal trials, sts produced
significantly greater improvement on primary
and secondary outcome measures, which
included the 28-item hamilton rating scale for
depression (ham-d28) and montgomery-asberg
depression rating scale (madrs) scores and
clinical global impression (cgi) ratings.
to date, results from two randomized controlled trials (rcts)5960 have been reported. in
a 6-week, fixed-dose, rct of 176 subjects, sts
6 mg/24 hours was significantly more effective
compared with placebo on the primary (17-item
ham-d and secondary endpoints. 59 tyraminerestricted diet was recommended in this study.
sts was separated from placebo by week 1,
raising the possibility of accelerated response
due to a systemic drug-delivery route.61 about
38% of subjects on sts responded (>50%
reduction in ham-d17) and 23% remitted (ham-

d17 score <8) compared with 23% response and
11% remission rate in the placebo group.the
compliance with the patch was high, with nearly
90% of sts subjects completing the trial.
the second trial 60 was an 8-week, dose titration (sts 6-12 mg/24 hours) trial of 289 subjects without dietary restrictions. primary and
secondary efficacy endpoints included scores
on the ham-d17l ham-d28, and the madrs. sts
was significantly superior to placebo according
to ham-d 28 and madrs scores and showed
a nonsignificant superiority on the ham-d 17
(p=.o7) and clinical global impression ratings (p=.o55). responders (>50% reduction in
madrs scores) were significantly higher in
the sts group (33%) than the placebo group
(21%). responder differences were not striking
when defined by ham-d17 or ham-d28 scores.
overall, there was a modest but statistically significant improvement with sts compared with
placebo. data from this trial were supportive of
sts but the drug did not significantly separate
from placebo on the primary endpoint.
in a long-term trial,62 322 subjects with mdd
who had responded during an initial, open-label,
10-week trial of fixed-dose sts, were randomized to sts 6 mg/24 hours or placebo for up to
12 months. relapse rates at 6 and 12 months
favored sts (17% at 12 months) over placebo
(31% at 12 months). substantially greater numbers of placebo patients (61%) received rescue
medication during the first 26 weeks of treatment
than sts patients (29%).62 it seems that improvement seen in short-term trials is maintained for
at least 1 year with continued sts treatment.the
data from the three trials as well as an unpublished trial (data submitted to the fda) are summarized intable 5.

jects required symptomatic treatment for the
asrs in the trials and <10% discontinued treatment due to asrs.
the potential for asr can be minimized by
proper precautions while applying the patches.
these include applying the patch on intact,
dry skin on the upper torso, upper thigh, or
upper arm; rotating the patch site daily; washing the site with soap and water and drying
it before application; ensuring that the patch
adheres properly by pressing it flat against
the skin; removing the patch every 24 hours;
and gently rinsing the skin site with warm
water after removal. most reactions subside
without treatment. if reactions persist or are
severe, local corticosteroids and/or oral antihistaminic agents, such as diphenhydramine,
should be used.
insomnia has been reported, particularly
with higher doses of sts (eg, 12 mg/24 hours).
to minimize potential insomnia, sts should
be initiated at 6 mg/24 hours, preferably in
the morning. benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics can be used if insomnia
is troublesome.

hypotension was 9.8% in sts-treated patients
and 6.7% in placebo-treated patients. however,
orthostatic hypotension and falls are more of
a concern in the elderly. such patients should
be monitored for postural changes in blood
pressure throughout treatment. dose increases
should be made cautiously in patients with preexisting orthostasis. postural hypotension may
be relieved by having the patient recline until
the symptoms have abated or asking patients
to change positions gradually. patients displaying orthostatic symptoms may need their
dose adjusted.
rates of sexual, digestive, and central
nervous system side effects with sts were
comparable with those with placebo. in
6-8-week studies,5960 there were no significant changes in weight between sts (mean
change: -1.2 pounds) compared with placebo
(mean change: 0.3 pounds).the incidence
of >5% weight gain or loss was no different between drug and placebo. in long-term
studies (3-12 months),42 the average weight
change with sts was -1.6 pounds.
skin reactions
application site reactions (asrs), such
as rash, itching, redness, or irritation, were
more common in sts-treated patients (36%)
than in placebo patients (17%) (p=.oo6).59
pauporte and colleagues 63 found that the
rate of skin reactions was significantly higher
with sts (22%) compared with placebo
(12%) in 1,326 subjects with a mean duration
of exposure of 75 days. in general, few sub-

sts is a category c drug like most antidepressants and there are no data on secretion

in clinical studies of sts,42 there have been

young patients, though the elderly appear at
higher risk for skin rash.there are no data on

review article

there are no data on discontinuation of sts.
in the absence of data on downtitration of sts,
it is difficult to make specific recommendations
about abrupt versus gradual discontinuation. in
clinical trials, subjects were abruptly discontinued at the end of the trials; however most of the
studies were short-term. from a clinical standpoint, abrupt discontinuation of the 6 mg/24
hours patch may be reasonable. whether the
12 mg- or 9 mg/24 hours patches should be discontinued abruptly or tapered to the 6 mg/24hour patch prior to discontinuation will depend
upon the clinical history as well as patient and
clinician preferences. a better understanding of
taper strategies may occur with wider clinical
use of the drug. at least 2 weeks should elapse
after stopping sts before commencing treatment with another antidepressant or a drug that
is contraindicated with sts.

mechanism of antidepressant
action of selegiline transdermal
system
selegiline has been found to potentiate dopamine transmission in the brain primarily due to
mao-b inhibition. 7 additionally, sts would be
expected to elevate brain 5-ht and ne levels due
to inhibition of brain mao-a.6466 interestingly, the
acute increases in brain 5-ht and ne with maois
subside with continued treatment and the levels
gradually return to the pre-treatment state due to
end-product inhibition of biosynthesis and adaptive
changes in the neurotransmitter receptor sensitivity.1 chronic maoi administration has been shown
to enhance 5-ht neurotransmission by altering the
rate of 5-ht neuron firing and the release of 5-ht
from nerve endings.6667 it is likely that elevated
levels of 5-ht, ne, and dopamine resulting from
mao inhibition play some role in the antidepressant effects of sts.68 selegiline also has several
pharmacologic effects in the brain other than its
mao inhibition. for example, selegiline has been
found to have antioxidant and neuroprotective
properties.69 in this context, defects in antioxidative
systems have been found in depression.70

therapeutic implications
major depressive disorder with atypical
features
mdd with atypical features characterized by
reverse vegetative symptoms (eg, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, retardation) and mood reactivity is viewed as distinct from other forms of
depressive disorders. prevalence rates of 30%
in depressive outpatients and 5% in the community have been reported.6973 a recent large metaanalysis74 showed that maois are superior to
tcas (effect size=0.27; 95% cl: 0.16-0.42) in mdd
with atypical features, replicating results from an
earlier meta-analysis.28 only three rcts28 have
directly compared ssris with maois in atypical
depression. both drugs were found to have comparable efficacy in atypical depression. however,
the results should be interpreted cautiously
because two included the rima moclobemide
that may be less efficacious than the irreversible
maoi. 75 while mdd without atypical features
responds equally well to maois andtcas or
ssris, it seems that atypical depression may
preferentially respond to maois.28

dosage a n d indication
sts has been fda approved for the treatment of mdd. sts comes in three strengths: a 6
mg/24-hour patch (20 mg/20 cm2), a 9 mg/24-hour
patch (30 mg/30 cm2), and a 12 mg/24-hour patch
(40 mg/40 cm2) in separate boxes of 30 patches.
dietary modifications are not necessary with the
6 mg/24-hour patch but are required with the 9
mg/24-hour and 12 mg/24-hour patches.the starting and target dose should be 6 mg/24 hours.
dose increases, if required should occur in 3
mg/24 hours increments at >2-week intervals until
the maximum recommended dose of 12 mg/24
hours is reached. no data are available to support a greater efficacy at higher doses. generally,
the sts should be applied at the same time of
the day, preferably in the morning. a minimum
washout period equal to 5 half-lives from existing
antidepressants (~1 week for most antidepressants, 5 weeks for fluoxetine) is recommended
before initiating sts treatment. patients should
be informed that tyramine-rich foods should be
avoided from the first day of using the 9 mg/24
hours or 12 mg/24 hours patch.the dietary modifications should continue for at least 2 weeks after
dose reduction to 6 mg/24 hours or discontinuation of the 9 mg or 12 mg 24-hour patch.

treatment-resistant depression

practice guidelines have recommended maois in
trd.77 a recent retrospective study78 of 59 patients
withtrd found that 56% of maoi trials in patients
with early trd (defined as those who had failed
to respond to <3 previous antidepressant trials)
resulted in a cgi-lmprovement score of 1 (very
much better) or 2 (much better). however, only
12% of maoi trials in patients with advanced trd
(failed >3 antidepressant trials) resulted in remission.78the maois studied included older maois
and oral selegiline. similar results supporting efficacy of maois in trd have been reported previously.167679 sts may benefit patients withtrd and
clearly prospective, controlled studies to examine
this issue should be conducted.

tions. sts represents a new generation of maoi
that seems to have safety advantages over the
older maois. available evidence shows that 6
mg/24 hours of sts is effective in mdd and can
be safely taken without dietary modifications.
although higher doses of sts (9 mg and 12
mg/24 hours) also demonstrate a superior safety
profile than older maois, the limited clinical
and experimental evidence suggest that dietary
modifications should be instituted at these doses.
due to paucity of data, it is premature to infer
whether sts will offer any incremental value in
efficacy over currently available antidepressants
or whether its side-effect profile may differ with
long-term use. nevertheless, introduction of sts
expands the range of therapeutic options for clinicians to treat mdd. further studies are necessary
to compare sts with conventional antidepressants and to suggest evidence-based guidelines
for the use of sts in clinical practice. cns

therapeutic areas needing further study
oral selegiline and sts has been shown to
hold promise in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd).8081 sts was
also shown to block cocaine-induced euphoria
and cardiovascular effects in a controlled study,82
consistent with results from an earlier trial of oral
selegiline in cocaine dependence.83 studies8485
have also found that oral selegiline was effective
in reducing craving for nicotine and reduced the
need for nicotine replacement therapy, although
it did not influence long-term abstinence from
smoking. a 6-week augmentation trial86 with oral
selegiline was found to lead to reduction in negative and depressive symptoms in 21 patients with
chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
with prominent negative symptoms who were
receiving antipsychotic medications. interestingly,
positive symptoms did not worsen in this study.86
another case series87 also supported selegiline
use in schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms who were smokers. older maois
have been found to be effective in panic disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, phobia, and anxiety
disorders,88 although oral selegiline or sts has
not been studied in these populations.

conclusion
there is a large unmet need in patients with
mdd. although ssris and newer antidepressants
are effective, a significant proportion of patients
fail to respond and the remission rates are not
high.this is coupled with high rates of noncompliance, troublesome side effects, and the risk of
withdrawal syndrome. despite evidence of efficacy, older maois have been mostly avoided by
clinicians due to safety issues and dietary restriccns spectr 1 1:5
