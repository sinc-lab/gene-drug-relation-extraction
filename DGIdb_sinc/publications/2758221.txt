1 the potent,  xxxd2022xxx  drug ergotamine has affinity for both 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 binding sites
and constricts arteriovenous anastomoses. since 5-ht also constricts arteriovenous anastomoses
(mainly via 5-ht1-like receptors), this study investigates the involvement of 5-ht receptors in the
ergotamine-induced reduction of arteriovenous shunting in the carotid circulation of the cat and
pig.
2 in the cat, ergotamine (3, 10 and 30 ug kg 1, i.v.) reduced carotid blood flow, predominantly by
a reduction in arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow. pretreatment with  xxxd2419xxx  (0.5 mgkg 1,
i.v.) or methiothepin (1 mg kg- ', i.v.) did not antagonize the effects of ergotamine.
3 in the pig, ergotamine (2.5, 5, 10 and 20pgkg-', i.v.) also reduced carotid blood flow and
arteriovenous shunting, which was not affected by pretreatment with methiothepin (1 mg kg- 1, i.v.).
4 these results suggest that the reduction by ergotamine in the shunting of carotid arterial blood
via cephalic arteriovenous anastomoses is not mediated by 5-ht1-like or 5-ht2 receptors.
introduction

ergotamine is a potent and effective drug for the
treatment of acute attacks of migraine headaches
where, among other pathophysiological factors (for
references, see blau, 1987), an opening of arteriovenous anastomoses has been suggested (heyck,

1969; saxena, 1978; 1987). indeed, ergotamine
decreases blood flow in the carotid circulation in a
variety of species, including man (saxena & de
vlaam-schluter, 1974; spira et al., 1976; puzich et
al., 1983). in anaesthetized cats (johnston & saxena,
1978), pigs (schamhardt et al., 1979) and dogs
(saxena et al., 1983), the decrease in carotid blood
flow by ergotamine is almost entirely due to a
reduction in the cephalic arteriovenous anastomotic
('shunt') fraction. the constrictor effect of ergotamine
on arteriovenous anastomoses in the dog is not
antagonized by  xxxd2914xxx  and/or pizotifen,
thereby excluding the involvement of aadrenoceptors and histamine h1-receptors, as well as
the 'd' 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) receptors
(saxena et al., 1983) which are claimed to be
involved in ergotamine-induced constrictions of isolated extracranial arteries (mtiller-schweinitzer &
weidmann, 1978; muller-schweinitzer, 1986).

the receptors for 5-ht have recently been subdivided into three distinct types, called 5-ht1-like,
5-ht2 (generally equivalent to 'd' 5-ht) and 5-ht3
receptors (bradley et al., 1986; humphrey &
richardson, 1988). the selective agonists at the three
receptor
types
are,
respectively,
5carboxamidotryptamine, a-methyl-5-ht and 2methyl-5-ht.  xxxd2419xxx  and mdl 72222
selectively antagonize 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 receptors
respectively, whilst methiothepin and  xxxd2621xxx 
are non-selective antagonists at both 5-ht2 and
5-ht1-like receptors. the 5-ht1-like receptors
mediate the constriction of arteriovenous anastomoses by 5-ht in the carotid circulation of the pig,
since this response is mimicked by 5carboxamidotryptamine (saxena & verdouw 1985a)
and other selective 5-ht1-like agonists such as bea
1654 (verdouw et al., 1985), ah25086 (humphrey et
al., 1987) and gr43175 (feniuk et al., 1987; humphrey et al., 1988), and is blocked by methiothepin but
not by  xxxd2419xxx  or mdl 72222 (verdouw et al.,
1984; saxena et al., 1986). recent radioligand experiments show that ergotamine possesses a high affinity
for 5-ht1 binding sites (leysen & gommeren, 1984;
richardson et al., 1986). in this investigation, therefore, we address the question whether 5-ht1-like

receptors mediate the ergotamine-induced constriction of arteriovenous anastomoses. for this
purpose the effects of ergotamine on the carotid circulation has been compared in untreated cats and
pigs with those in animals pretreated with  xxxd2419xxx 
or methiothepin.

3mm, i.d.; transfilow 601-system, skalar, delft). a
hub-less 0.5 mm (external diameter) needle, connected to suitable polyethylene tubing, was inserted
in this common carotid artery for the administration
of microspheres and methiothepin (see later). the
animals were wrapped in a thermo-insulating
blanket to maintain body temperature between 37380c.

methods
experimental set-up
cats the experimental set-up used in the cats has
been described in detail (johnston & saxena, 1978;
saxena & verdouw, 1982). briefly, the animals
weighing between 2.1 and 4.4 kg, were anaesthetized
with a mixture of a-chloralose (60mg kg 1, i.p.) and
urethane (700 mg kg- 1, i.p.). bilateral cervical
vagosympathectomy was performed (to reduce reflex
influences on the carotid circulation) and the trachea
was cannulated and connected to a respirator for
intermittent positive pressure ventilation. arterial
blood gasses were monitored and kept within
normal limits (ph, 7.35-7.45; pao2, 90-150mmhg;
paco2, 35-45 mmhg). aortic blood pressure was
measured with a statham transducer (model p23 ac)
connected to a polyethylene cannula inserted in a
femoral artery. heart rate was derived from the pressure signals. the femoral vein was cannulated for
drug administration. blood flow in the left common
carotid artery was measured with electromagnetic
flow probes (1.5-2mm i.d.; transflow 600-system,
skalar, delft, the netherlands). a catheter was
placed in the left lingual artery to allow retrograde
injection of microspheres into the carotid artery. the
body temperature was maintained around 37°c by
use of an electric heating pad.

pigs as described earlier (saxena & verdouw,
1982), fasted young yorkshire pigs (body weight: 1929kg) were sedated with azaperone (120mg, i.m.)
and metomidate (120-150mg, i.v.), intubated and
given intermittent positive pressure ventilation with
a mixture (1: 2) of oxygen and nitrous oxide. a continuous infusion of pentobarbitone sodium (2026 mg kg- t h - 1, i.v.) completed the anaesthesia.
respiratory rate and tidal volume were adjusted to
keep arterial blood gases and ph within normal
limits (see above). the right femoral artery and vein
were cannulated for the measurement of aortic blood
pressure (statham transducer, model p23 id) and
administration of ergotamine, respectively. heart
rate was derived from the pressure signals. the
common carotid arteries were dissected free and
both cervical vagosympathetic trunks were severed.
blood flow in one of the common carotid arteries
was measured with a precalibrated flow probe (2.5-

distribution of common carotid blood flow
the distribution of common carotid blood flow was
determined with the radioactive microsphere method
using 15 + 1 (s.d.) ym diameter spheres labelled with
either 141ce, 113sn, 103ru, 95nb or 46sc (nen
company, dreieich, west germany). for each measurement a suspension of microspheres, labelled with
one of the nuclides, was mechanically agitated and
injected against the direction of the carotid blood
flow to facilitate uniform mixing with the blood. at
the end of the experiment the animal was killed and
the heart, kidneys, lungs and the various tissues of
the head were dissected out, weighed and placed in
vials. the radioactivity in these vials was counted for
5-10min in a v-scintillation counter (packard
minaxi autogamma 5000) using suitable windows
for discriminating the different isotopes. the amount
of carotid blood flow distributed to the individual
tissues (qtisicarj) was calculated as described earlier
(saxena et al., 1980; saxena & verdouw, 1982) by:
x q[carj, where itis and
qtis[car] (ml min - ) = (itiito,)
the

are,

respectively,

radioactivity (c.p.m.)

particular tissue and that detected in all tissues, and
q[carj is carotid blood flow (ml min- 1). because there
was complete entrapment of microspheres passing
through the cranial circulation in the capillaries of
the lungs (no significant amounts of radioactivity
were detected in the heart or kidneys), the values
determined for the lungs provide an index of the
arteriovenous anastomotic fraction of the common
carotid blood flow (see johnston & saxena, 1978;
saxena & verdouw, 1982).
experimental protocol
cats about 45 min after completion of the surgical
procedures baseline measurements of heart rate,
blood pressure and common carotid blood flow and
its distribution (using 20,000-50,000 radioactive
microspheres) were made. the cats were then divided
into three groups receiving pretreatment with either
physiological saline (0.9% nacl, w/v) (2 ml, i.v.),
 xxxd2419xxx  (0.5 mgkg- 1, i.v.) or methiothepin
(lmgkg-1, i.v.) this pretreatment was followed by
the administration of ergotamine in cumulative
doses (3, 10, 30pgkg-1, i.v.) at intervals of 15min.

ments were repeated at the end of each intervention
(pretreatment and the three ergotamine doses).
pigs after a post-surgical stabilization period of
about 45min, the animals were divided into two
groups receiving intracarotid infusions (rate:
1mlmin' for a period of 10min) of either physiological saline or methiothepin (total dose:
1mgkg-1). ten minutes later, in all experiments
baseline measurements of heart rate, arterial blood
pressure, common carotid arterial blood flow and its
distribution (with 100,000-150,000 spheres) were
made. these measurements were repeated after the
administration of ergotamine (2.5, 5, 10 and
20 pg kg-1 in cumulative doses) at intervals of
15 min.
statistical analysis

the significance of the differences between the variables was evaluated by duncan's new multiple range
test, once an analysis of variance (randomized block
design) had revealed that the samples represented
different populations (steel & torrie, 1980). sta-

tistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05 (twotailed). all data are expressed as means + s.e.mean.
drugs

apart from the anaesthetics, the drugs used in this
study were:  xxxd2022xxx  (gynergeen ampoules sandoz b.v., uden, the netherlands),  xxxd2419xxx 
tartrate (courtesy: dr j.m. van nueten, janssen
pharmaceutica, beerse, belgium) and methiothepin
maleate (courtesy: dr p.j. pijper, hoffmann-la
roche b.v., mijdrecht, the netherlands). the drugs
were diluted with (ergotamine) or dissolved in
physiological saline. the doses of ergotamine,  xxxd2419xxx  and methiothepin refer to the salts.

in both variables. irrespective of the type of pretreatment, cumulative doses of ergotamine (3, 10 and
30 pg kg - 1, i.v.) caused a decrease in heart rate,
whereas arterial blood pressure showed a marked
increase (table 1). in the pig experiments ergotamine
had no effect on mean arterial blood pressure in
either the saline- or methiothepin-treated animals.

carotid haemodynamics
cats in the saline group of animals, where salinetreatment itself had no effect on carotid blood flow
or its distribution, cumulative doses of ergotamine
(3, 10 and 30pgkg-1, i.v.) caused a decrease in total
carotid blood flow. this decrease was predominantly
in the arteriovenous anastomotic fraction (non-nutrient) but the nutrient (arteriolar; capillary) fraction
was also reduced (figure 1). pretreatment with
 xxxd2419xxx  (0.5 mg kg- 1) or methiothepin (1 mg kg 1)
caused a decrease in total carotid blood flow which
was similar in the arteriovenous anastomotic and
nutrient fractions. neither pretreatment modified the
effects of ergotamine on total carotid and arteriovenous anastomotic blood flows though the decrease
in nutrient flow seemed attenuated (figure 1). the
decrease in the nutrient blood flow by ergotamine in
the animals pretreated with saline was distributed
over a number of cephalic tissues, particularly the
ears, skin, muscles and salivary glands, but not the
brain (data not shown). pretreatment with  xxxd2419xxx  reduced blood flow, especially to the muscles,
ears and skin. methiothepin also reduced blood flow
to the muscles and ears. both drugs seemed to
prevent ergotamine-induced decreases in nutrient
blood flow, but the pre-ergotamine blood flow values
were less after  xxxd2419xxx  and methiothepin when
compared to saline (figure 1).
since both potential antagonist drugs,  xxxd2419xxx 
and methiothepin, decreased mean arterial blood
pressure, the effects of these drugs on blood flow
may be related to reduced perfusion pressure; hence
vascular conductances within the carotid bed were
calculated as ratios of blood flow and mean arterial
blood pressure values. the data reveal that the
decrease in blood flow by  xxxd2419xxx  and methiothepin was clearly related to the drop in blood pressure,
probably caused by vasodilatation in other vascular
beds. furthermore, it is observed that ergotamineinduced decreases in vascular conductances in total
carotid, arteriovenous anastomotic and nutrient
beds were not much altered by either  xxxd2419xxx  or
methiothepin (figure 2). the examination of individual tissues shows that vascular conductance
decreased with ergotamine in the saline pretreated
animals in the ears, skin, eyes, muscles, bones and

salivary glands, but not in the brain. in antagonist
pretreated animals the effects of ergotamine were
apparently either less or absent in several tissues;
however, as with blood flow values, the preergotamine conductance values were lower than in
the saline group (data not shown).
pigs as in the cats, ergotamine dose-dependently
reduced common carotid blood flow in the salinepretreated pigs by decreasing arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow; the nutrient (arteriolar; capillary)
fraction was unaffected. pretreatment with methiothepin (1 mg kg- 1) did not much modify the effects of
ergotamine (figure 3). after administration of
ergotamine, blood flow to some tissues (brain, eyes,
fat, bones or salivary glands) did not change, but in
others there was a tendency to increase (ears, skin
and tongue) or decrease (muscles). the increases in
tissue blood flow seemed to be attenuated in animals
pretreated with methiothepin (data not shown).

discussion
shunting of microspheres
the present results confirm the observations that a
large fraction (cat: 35-45%; dog: 40-45%; pig:
75-80%) of 15 pm microspheres, injected into the
carotid circulation of anaesthetized animals, is not
trapped in the arteriolar bed of the cephalic tissues;
these spheres pass via arteriovenous anastomoses
and veins to the right side of the heart to be sieved
by the pulmonary capillary bed (johnston & saxena;
1978; saxena & verdouw, 1982; saxena et al., 1983).
the simultaneous use of microspheres of four different diameters (10, 15, 25 and 35pm) has shown that
the large arteriovenous anastomoses in the cephalic
circulation are mainly present in the skin and ears
(saxena & verdouw, 1985b), but such 'shunt' vessels
have also been located in the nasal mucosa
(anggard, 1974), tongue (kronert et al., 1980), dura
mater (rowbotham & little, 1965) and rete mirabile
(gillilan & markesbery, 1963). the opening of
arteriovenous anastomoses, possibly secondary to a
decrease in blood 5-ht concentrations (lance,
1982), may be involved in the pathophysiology of
migraine (see heyck, 1969; saxena, 1978; 1987).
effects of ergotamine
ergotamine decreased heart rate in both cats and
pigs. in the cat the ergotamine-induced bradycardia
is due to an agonist action on presynaptic dopamine
receptors located on the cardiac sympathetic nerve
terminals (saxena & cairo-rawlins, 1983), but in the
rat presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors have been implicated (roquebert & grenie, 1986).

,

in both species studied, ergotamine caused a doserelated decrease in carotid blood flow, predominantly by affecting the arteriovenous anastomotic
fraction. pretreatment with the  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  or the mixed 5-ht1-like and
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonist methiothepin did not

were more than adequate, since they antagonize
several cardiovascular responses mediated by
5-ht1-like receptors (e.g.: 5-ht-induced hypotension in the rat and cat, tachycardia in the cat and
arteriovenous anastomotic constriction and arteriolar dilatation in the porcine carotid bed; saxena &
lawang, 1985; saxena et al. 1985; 1986; connor et
al., 1986) or by 5-ht2 receptors (e.g.: 5-ht-induced
hypertension in the rat; saxena & lawang, 1985).
therefore, despite demonstration of a high affinity
for both 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 binding sites (leysen &
gommeren, 1984) and for 5-ht2 receptors in 'large'
conducting arteries (muller-schweinitzer & weidmann, 1978; muller-schweinitzer, 1986), the
reduction in the carotid blood flow following constriction of cephalic arteriovenous anastomoses by
ergotamine does not appear to be mediated by either
5-ht1-like or 5-ht2 receptors. as shown earlier in
the dog,  xxxd2914xxx  and pizotifen were also
unable to modify the responses to ergotamine,
excluding the involvement of a-adrenoceptors as well
as histamine h1-receptors (saxena et al., 1983). a
possible mediation by 5-ht3 receptors can not be
ruled out from the present experiments, but neither
5-ht3 receptors mediate constriction of arteriovenous anastomoses (saxena et al., 1986) nor does
ergotamine have an agonist action on these receptors. thus receptors involved in the ergotamineinduced reduction of arteriovenous anastomotic
blood flow in the carotid vascular bed are yet to be
characterized. in this context it may be recalled that
5-ht can act on receptors unrelated to 5-ht1-like,
5-ht2 or 5-ht3 types in isolated papillary muscle of
kitten (kaumann, 1985) and in the pig heart (bom et
al., 1988) and that vasodilator dopamine receptors
have been described on arteriovenous anastomoses
in the canine paw pad (bell et al., 1978; bell & lang,
1979). whether ergotamine can act on these receptors is not yet known. another mechanism explaining the action of ergotamine could be related to
prostaglandin formation. in canine vein strips the
constrictor response to ergotamine is in part mediated by production of a prostaglandin-like substance
(mufler-schweinitzer & weidmann, 1978) and prostaglandin f2. can increase vascular resistance in the
external carotid bed of the monkey (spira et al.,
1978).
the vasoconstrictor action of ergotamine in some
tissues was attenuated in both  xxxd2419xxx - and
methiothepin-pretreated animals. it may suggest that
the vasoconstriction by ergotamine in the nutrient
circulation may be partly mediated by aadrenoceptors and/or 5-ht2 receptors (see saxena
& de vlaam-schluter, 1974; mulier-schweinitzer &
weidmann, 1978).

ergotamine-induced ava constriction

in conclusion this study shows that the effects of
ergotamine on arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow
in cat and pig are not mediated by 5-ht1-like or
5-ht2 receptors. the involvement of aadrenoceptors and histamine hi-receptors has been
excluded in earlier studies.
