abstract:  xxxg913xxx  adenylyltransferase ( xxxg1808xxx ) regulates the activity of  xxxg913xxx 
by adenylylation and deadenylylation in response to signals of nitrogen and carbon status: glutamine,
r-ketoglutarate, and the uridylylated and unmodified forms of the pii signal transduction protein.  xxxg1808xxx 
consists of two conserved nucleotidyltransferase (nt) domains linked by a central region of ∼200 amino
acids. here, we study the activities and regulation of mutated and truncated forms of  xxxg1808xxx . our results
indicate the following. (i) the n-terminal nt domain contained the adenylyl-removing (ar) active site,
and the c-terminal nt domain contained the adenylyltransferase (at) active site. (ii) the enzyme contained
a glutamine binding site, and glutamine increased the affinity for pii. (iii) the enzyme appeared to contain
multiple sites for the binding of pii and pii-ump. (iv) truncated versions of  xxxg1808xxx  missing the c-terminal
(nt) domain lacked both at and ar activity, suggesting a role for the c-terminal nt domain in both
activities. (v) the purified c-terminal nt domain and larger polypeptides containing this domain had
significant basal at activity, which was stimulated by glutamine. these polypeptides were indifferent to
pii and pii-ump, or their  xxxg1808xxx  activity was inhibited by either pii or pii-ump. (vi) certain point
mutations in the central region or an internal deletion removing most of this part of the protein eliminated
the ar activity and eliminated activation of the at activity by pii, while not eliminating the binding of
pii or pii-ump. that is, these mutations in the central region appeared to destroy the communication
between the pii and pii-ump binding sites and the at and ar active sites. (vii) certain mutations in the
central region of  xxxg1808xxx  appeared to dramatically improve the binding of glutamine to the enzyme. (viii)
while the isolated at and ar domains of  xxxg1808xxx  bound poorly to pii and pii-ump, these domains
bound pii and pii-ump significantly better when linked to the central region of  xxxg1808xxx . together, our
results indicate a highly coordinated enzyme, in which the at and ar domains participate in each other’s
regulation and distant regulatory sites are in communication with each other. a model for the regulation
of  xxxg1808xxx  by glutamine, pii, and pii-ump consistent with all data is presented.

 xxxg1808xxx ,1 product of glne, regulates the activity of glutamine
synthetase (gs) in response to intracellular signals of
nitrogen status, by catalyzing the adenylylation and deadenylylation of gs (1, 2). the enzyme participates in both
short-term and long-term adaptation to nitrogen status (3,
4). under nitrogen-excess growth conditions, gs is adenylylated by  xxxg1808xxx , resulting in low gs activity. conversely,
under nitrogen-limiting conditions, gs∼amp is deadenylylated by  xxxg1808xxx , restoring gs activity.  xxxg1808xxx  allows rapid
alteration of gs activity in response to dramatically changing
environments (4). the enzyme is widely distributed in
bacteria, as is regulation of  xxxg913xxx  by reversible

covalent adenylylation, and in some bacteria, the enzyme is
essential for cellular viability (5).
historically,  xxxg1808xxx  was one of the first signal transduction
enzymes identified (1, 2, 6), and it provided the first example
of reversible nucleotidylylation as a signal transduction
mechanism (7). the study of  xxxg1808xxx  regulation in escherichia
coli also provided one of the first examples of a bicyclic
signal transduction system (8-10; figure 1a). one cycle
of this bicyclic system consists of the uridylyltransferase/
uridylyl-removing enzyme (utase/ur, product of glnd) and
the pii signal transduction protein. under physiological
conditions, utase/ur controls the pii uridylylation state in
response to the glutamine concentration (11). pii and piiump regulate the antagonistic adenylylation (at) and
adenylyl-removing (ar) activities of  xxxg1808xxx  (12 and references cited therein). specifically, pii activates the at activity
and pii-ump the ar activity, and each also inhibits the
antagonistic activity (figure 1a). in addition, glutamine
directly activates the at activity and inhibits the ar activity
(figure 1a). a signal antagonistic to glutamine is provided
by r-ketoglutarate, which acts through pii and pii-ump (13).
a low level of r-ketoglutarate favors the action of pii, and
a high level of r-ketoglutarate (figure 1a) favors the action

figure 1: bicyclic signal transduction system regulating gs
activity. (a) topology of the network. the bicycle is comprised
of two linked monocycles. in the utase/ur-pii monocycle, the
pii protein is converted between unmodified and uridylylated forms
by the ut and ur activities of the utase/ur protein. glutamine
(gln) activates the ur activity and inhibits the ut activity. in the
 xxxg1808xxx -gs monocycle, the gs enzyme is converted between
unmodified and adenylylated forms by the at and ar activities
of the  xxxg1808xxx  protein. glutamine (gln) activates the at activity
and inhibits the ar activity. pii also activates the at activity and
inhibits the ar activity. pii-ump activates the ar activity and
inhibits the at activity. r-ketoglutarate acts upon pii and piiump; a low concentration of this effector favors the action of pii
and inhibits the action of pii-ump, while a high concentration of
this effector inhibits the action of pii and favors the action of piiump. (b) integration of antagonistic r-ketoglutarate and glutamine
signals by the reconstituted bicyclic system. data are from ref 12.

of pii-ump. the bicyclic system has been reconstituted using
purified components, and the reconstituted system provided
rapid alteration of the gs adenylylation state in response to
alterations in the concentrations of glutamine and r-ketoglutarate and reproducibly “calculated” an appropriate gs
adenylylation state in response to effectors [e.g., figure 1b
(12)]. the question of how exactly pii, pii-ump, r-ketoglutarate, and glutamine bring about the regulation of the
at and ar activities of  xxxg1808xxx  remains.
the adenylylation (at) activity of  xxxg1808xxx  catalyzes the
addition of amp to tyrosine 397 of gs, with the release of
pyrophosphate (7). this reaction is activated synergistically
by (unmodified) pii and by glutamine; either effector alone
can partially activate the enzyme, and each effector reduces
the apparent kact of the other effector (12). the ability of
pii to activate  xxxg1808xxx  is regulated by the synergistic binding
of r-ketoglutarate and atp to pii. pii activity is highest
when the trimeric protein is bound by three molecules of
atp and a single molecule of r-ketoglutarate (12, 13). at
physiological atp concentrations, the binding of r-keto-

jiang et al.
glutarate to pii displays negative cooperativity such that the
binding of the first molecule of r-ketoglutarate inhibits
further effector binding. this negative cooperativity is
overcome as the level of r-ketoglutarate is increased through
its physiological range such that the pii trimers become
saturated with three effector molecules (12). the form of
pii saturated with three molecules of r-ketoglutarate per
trimer is unable to activate the at activity, and thus, as the
concentration of r-ketoglutarate is increased through its
physiological concentration range, it blocks the activation
of the at activity by pii (12). the at activity is inhibited
by pii-ump in the presence of pii and glutamine, and a
high level of r-ketoglutarate improves the ability of piiump to inhibit the at activity (12 and references cited
therein).
the ar activity catalyzes the phosphorolysis of gs∼amp
to produce gs and adp (14). in vitro, the activity requires
pii-ump as an essential activator and is weakly inhibited
by pii and by glutamine (12). the activation of the ar
activity by pii-ump requires r-ketoglutarate and is favored
by high concentrations of r-ketoglutarate. thus, as the
concentration of r-ketoglutarate is increased through its
physiological range, it both inhibits the ability of pii to
activate the at activity and improves the ability of pii-ump
to activate the ar activity (figure 1a).
bioinformatic analysis indicated that the 946-amino acid
 xxxg1808xxx  contains two copies of a highly conserved motif
shared by other nucleotidyltransferase enzymes, designated
the nt domain (15, 16; figure 2). the nt domains utilize
a two-metal mechanism (usually mg2+ ions) and contain a
glycine-rich loop followed by a pair of acidic amino acids,
usually aspartates, which participate in chelation of the mg2+
ions. the two mg2+ ions serve to position the substrate and
stabilize the pentavalent phosphate transition state, respectively (17, 18). the two nt domains in  xxxg1808xxx  are related
to each other, as well as to the single nt domain found
within the utase/ur (15, 16).
vasudevan and colleagues have examined the effect of
producing two “halves” of the  xxxg1808xxx  as discrete polypeptides
(15). the c-terminal polypeptide, consisting of residues
425-946 of  xxxg1808xxx , displayed at activity that was regulated
by glutamine but was reported to be unaffected by pii (15).
an n-terminal polypeptide, consisting of residues 1-423
of  xxxg1808xxx , was expressed and studied in crude fractions
(0-50% ammonium sulfate cut from a crude extract). it was
reported that this polypeptide had ar activity that was
activated by pii-ump and inhibited by pii and unaffected
by glutamine (15). on the basis of these observations, it was
concluded that the two opposing activities of  xxxg1808xxx  reside
in the distinct nt domains, with the n-terminal domain
catalyzing the ar activity and the c-terminal nt domain
catalyzing the at activity (15). furthermore, it was concluded that a single pii/pii-ump site maps within the
polypeptide of residues 1-423, while a glutamine binding
site maps in the polypeptide of residues 425-946 (15).
here, we further examine the structure-function relationships of the  xxxg1808xxx  and its mechanism of control. some of
our results are consistent with the results of vasudevan and
colleagues. specifically, we show by site-specific mutagenesis of the putative active sites that the n-terminal domain
of  xxxg1808xxx  contains the ar active site and the c-terminal
domain of  xxxg1808xxx  contains the at active site. we also

the beginning and end of each species indicate the first and last
amino acid present, respectively. the cross-hatched box depicts
the deleted region in atm∆. the atm series of enzymes contain
clusters of point mutations in different parts of the central region,
as described in the text. specifically, atm1 contains the d463n,
p467a, and l469g mutations, atm2 the r499a, r501a, d505n,
p509a, and l511g mutations, atm3 the l525g, r527a, and
i528g mutations, and atm4 the r571a, p573a, and l575g
mutations.

observed that the enzyme contains a glutamine site that
probably maps to the c-terminal at domain. however, other
results shown here are not in agreement with the conclusions
of vasudevan and colleagues (15). our results suggest that
the enzyme contains multiple pii/pii-ump sites, and we
demonstrate conclusively that the enzyme contains a pii/
pii-ump site on the c-terminal side of position 425. in the
aggregate, our results show that the enzyme is highly
coordinated, with the at and ar domains participating in
each other’s regulation and communication among the pii,
pii-ump, and glutamine sites. a hypothesis for the organization and regulation of the enzyme is presented.
experimental procedures
recombinant dna techniques. the wild-type glne gene
encoding  xxxg1808xxx  was amplified from e. coli strain ymc10
by pcr, using the primers listed in table 1, and cloned into
palter-1 (promega), and its sequence was verified by
dna sequencing. at-ndn (d173n and d175n), at-cdn
(d701n and d703n), atm1 (d463n, p467a, and l469g),
atm2 (r499a, r501a, d505n, p509a, and l511g),
atm3 (l525g, r527a, and i528g), and atm4 (r571a,
p573a, l575g) were constructed using the palter mutagenesis kit (promega), following the instructions of the
vendor and using the mutagenic oligonucleotides listed in

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 13, 2007 4119
table s1 of the supporting information. the mutations in
atm1, atm2, atm3, and atm4 were chosen to test the
role of portions of the central region of  xxxg1808xxx  that bear some
resemblance to the beta-hairpin element of the c-terminal
domain of nrii, implicated as possibly forming part of the
pii-binding site of nrii (19). atm∆ was constructed as
follows. the palter mutagenesis kit was used to introduce
two restriction sites for xhoi into the wild-type gene, using
the primers listed in table s1. the mutated gene was
digested with xhoi and ligated with dna ligase to form
the desired internal deletion mutation. truncated forms of
the  xxxg1808xxx  were formed by pcr using the primers listed in
table s1. all mutated alleles and truncated alleles were
verified by dna sequencing. the wild-type allele, alleles
containing point mutations, and truncated alleles were cloned
into pjla503 for hyperexpression of the protein products
(20). hyperexpression of proteins from the pjla503-based
plasmids was induced by a temperature shift to 43 °c and
used strain ec (21), which contains a null mutation in glne
and thus lacks endogenous  xxxg1808xxx .
purified proteins. preparations of gs, nrii, pii, and pii(e44c/c73s) obtained previously were used (12, 22, 23).
gs∼amp was freshly prepared for each series of experiments as described previously (12). for purification of  xxxg1808xxx 
and mutant forms of  xxxg1808xxx , cells containing the hyperexpressed protein were harvested and stored as a frozen cell
paste at -80 °c. in all cases, overexpression was sufficient
to permit purification of the desired proteins to be monitored
by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
purification of  xxxg1808xxx , at-cdn, and at-ndn was
conducted briefly as follows. cells were resuspended in 50
mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dtt,
and 200 mm kcl (tgdk buffer), disrupted by sonication,
and clarified by centrifugation. a 25-50% ammonium
sulfate cut was made, and the precipitate was collected by
centrifugation, resuspended in  xxxg9xxx  buffer (tgdk lacking
kcl), diluted with  xxxg9xxx , and applied to a de-52 column
(whatman) equilibrated with  xxxg9xxx  buffer. proteins were
eluted with a 0 to 0.6 m kcl gradient in  xxxg9xxx  buffer;  xxxg1808xxx 
and the mutated forms of  xxxg1808xxx  were eluted at ∼310-350
mm kcl. peak fractions were then pooled and fractionated
on a bio-gel a0.5m gel filtration column equilibrated in
tgdk buffer. peak fractions from the gel filtration column
were pooled and fractionated on phenyl sepharose cl-4b
(sigma) as follows. the column was equilibrated in 40 mm
tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 2 mm edta, 4 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
and 1 m (nh4)2so4 (temn buffer). the pooled sample from
gel filtration was brought to 25% saturated (nh4)2so4 and
applied to the column. the column was then washed with a
gradient of temn buffer to tem buffer [as temn but
lacking (nh4)2so4].  xxxg1808xxx  and mutant forms of  xxxg1808xxx 
remained bound to the column during this elution.  xxxg1808xxx 
and mutant forms of  xxxg1808xxx  were then eluted with a gradient
from 0 to 50% ethylene glycol in tem buffer. peak fractions
were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer [tgdk
buffer, except with 50% (v/v) glycerol]. purification of
atm∆, atm1, atm2, atm3, and atm4 was similar,
except that a 25-60% saturation ammonium sulfate cut was
used after sonication, the phenyl-sepharose chromatography
step was omitted, and the pooled peak from the gel filtration
step was dialyzed against storage buffer. purification of
truncated proteins atc1, atn1, atn2, and atn6 was as

4120 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 13, 2007
described above, using a 25-50% ammonium sulfate cut as
the first step and omitting the phenyl-sepharose step.
purification of atc2 was conducted as described for the
other truncated proteins, except that the protein did not stick
to de-52, and was recovered from the flow-through fraction.
purification of atc3 was briefly as follows. cells were
disrupted by sonication, and the polypeptide was fractionated
with the pellet. the pellet was resuspended in 6 m urea and
slowly stirred at 4 °c overnight. insoluble material was
removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed
against  xxxg9xxx  buffer. the dialysate was clarified by centrifugation; a 0-50% (nh4)2so4 cut was made, and the
resuspended pellet was subjected to gel filtration on sephadex
g-75. atc3 fractionated into two peaks, corresponding to
the excluded fraction and presumably the monomeric polypeptide. the latter was highly purified and dialyzed directly into
storage buffer.
preparation of pii-ump and pii (e44c/c73s)-ump was
as follows. a 10 ml reaction mixture contained 100 mm
tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 100 mm kcl, 25 mm mgcl2, 2 mm
dtt, 300 µm r-ketoglutarate, 500 µm atp, 2 mm utp,
10 µm trimer pii (e44c/c73s), and 0.1 µm monomer
utase/ur. the reaction was started by adding utp and the
mixture incubated at 37 °c for 25 min. the reaction was
stopped by adding edta to a final concentration 25 mm.
the utase/ur and pii-ump were separated on a monoq
column (pharmacia fplc) run at room temperature using a
gradient from 0 to 1 m kcl in  xxxg9xxx  buffer. pii-ump was
not separated from pii during this procedure but was well
separated from utase/ur; pii-ump eluted later than utase/
ur at ∼300 mm kcl. the peak pii-ump fractions were
pooled and heated to 60 °c for 5 min to kill any remaining
utase/ur activities, then concentrated using a 10 kda
molecular mass cutoff ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device
(millipore), and stored at -20 °c.
labeling of pii (e44c/c73s) and pii (e44c/c73s)-ump
with a cross-linker was exactly as described previously (22)
except that only the noncleavable tfpam-3 cross-linker was
used. tfpam-3 was purchased from molecular probes. in
some cases, 10% (v/v) glycerol was added to the final piitf3 preparation, and it was stored at -20 °c for later use.
this did not appear to result in any diminished cross-linking
ability.
cross-linking reactions. reaction mixtures contained 50
mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 2 mm
dtt, 500 µm atp as indicated, 20 µm, 50 µm, or 10 mm
r-ketoglutarate as indicated, 5 µm dimer nrii, 2 µm wildtype  xxxg1808xxx , 5 µm monomer  xxxg1808xxx  truncations, and 10 µm
trimer pii or pii-ump as indicated. as indicated, reaction
mixtures also contained 200 µg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(sigma). reaction volumes were typically 20-30 µl, and
reactions were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates on
ice. uv light was from a hand-held source placed directly
on the 96-well plate on ice for exposure for 20 min. reactions
were stopped by addition of sds loading buffer. aliquots
were run on 13.5% sds-polyacrylamide gels and the protein
bands visualized by coomassie brilliant blue r250 staining.
in some cases, aliquots were run on sds-polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting, as
indicated. note that phenylazide cross-linkers such as tfpam-3 must be used in the presence of an excess of
nucleophilic buffer, such as tris, to prevent nonspecific

cross-linking, and we observed that 50 mm tris-hcl, as used
here, appeared to be a suitable buffer concentration.
immunoblotting. blots were probed with anti-pii that was
generously provided by w. van heeswick (24). the crude
antibody was further purified as follows. a 250 ml luria
broth/chloramphenicol culture of strain bkc, lacking both
pii and glnk, was grown overnight at 37 °c. cells were
harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of
tris-buffered saline (tbs) [20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5) and
137 mm nacl]. the suspension was sonicated on ice to
break open the cells. polyclonal anti-pii serum was added
to the lysate (1:5000 dilution), and the mixture was stirred
for 1 h at room temperature to allow contaminating antibodies
to adsorb to the cellular protein. the mixture was cleared
by centrifugation, and the supernatant was saved. tween 20
was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), and the
extract-treated antibody was stored at 4 °c. blots were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) using the
amersham ecl kit according to the manufacturer’s directions.
nondenaturing gel electrophoresis assay for pii- xxxg1808xxx 
binding. the incubation mix contained 50 mm tris-hcl (ph
7.5), 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 2 mm atp, 50 µm
r-ketoglutarate or as indicated, 10 mm glutamine or as
indicated, and proteins as indicated. after incubation at room
temperature for 10 min, the samples were mixed with gel
loading buffer [50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5) and 10% (v/v)
glycerol] and subjected to electrophoresis on 14% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. the stacking gel contained
62.5 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.6), and the resolving gel contained
187.5 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5). the running buffer consisted
of 25 mm tris-borate (ph 7.5), 1 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm atp,
30 µm r-ketoglutarate (or as indicated), and 10 mm
glutamine (or as indicated). the gels were prerun at 100 v
for 50-75 min to balance the small molecule components
of the gels and buffer. after the electrophoretic run, gels
were stained with coomassie brilliant blue r-250 to
visualize the protein bands.
to determine if the presumed complex bands on the
nondenaturing gels contained both  xxxg1808xxx  and pii, the bands
were extracted and analyzed via sds-page as follows.
the native gels were stained briefly with coomassie brilliant
blue r-250 in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and then briefly
destained with 50% (v/v) methanol, using several changes
of the destaining solution. the visualized bands were excised
and soaked in 0.2× sds loading buffer and neutralized with
1 m tris-hcl (ph 9.0). (a minimal amount of the tris-hcl
was added, until the bromophenol blue ph indicator in the
sds loading buffer turned blue.) the gel slices were shaken
at 37 °c for 16 h to extract the proteins, and the gel extracts
were analyzed on 14% polyacrylamide-sds gels. after the
samples had been stained with coomassie blue, the bands
were quantified by densitometry using image quant software
(molecular dynamics).
gel filtration chromatography assay for pii- xxxg1808xxx 
binding. the incubation mixture contained 50 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5), 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 2 mm atp, 72 µm
r-ketoglutarate, 42 µm pii, 6 µm  xxxg1808xxx , and glutamine as
indicated. after incubation at room temperature for 15 min,
the sample was loaded onto a sephadex g-100 column
(∼120 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5), 100 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm atp, and

structure-function analysis of  xxxg1808xxx 
30 µm r-ketoglutarate and eluted with the same buffer at 4
°c. fractions containing proteins were analyzed by sdspage with coomassie blue staining.
adenylyltransferase (at) assays. the assay included 100
mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 100 mm kcl, 25 mm mgcl2, 0.3
mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 0.5 mm [r-32p]atp, and the
indicated concentrations of glutamine, r-ketoglutarate, pii
(expressed as the trimer concentration),  xxxg913xxx 
(gs, expressed as the dodecamer concentration), and  xxxg1808xxx 
or a mutant form of  xxxg1808xxx . incubation was carried out at
30 °c for the indicated times, and samples were analyzed
by either the nitrocellulose filter assay as described previously
(12) or sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed
by autoradiography.
adenylyl removing (ar) assays. gs was adenylylated as
described above, with gs at 2 µm, enzyme ( xxxg1808xxx  or atc1
at 2 µm or atc3 at 1 µm), and glutamine (10 mm when
 xxxg1808xxx  was used, 1 mm when atc1 was used, and no
glutamine when atc3 was used). no pii was present during
the adenylylation reactions used to prepare gs∼amp for
use as a substrate in the ar assays. after a 20 min incubation
at 30 °c, the reaction mixture was incubated at 60 °c for 10
min. this treatment irreversibly inactivates the  xxxg1808xxx  without
affecting the ability of gs∼amp to serve as a substrate in
the ar reaction. the reaction mixtures were then passed
over sephadex g-25 minicolumns to separate gs∼amp (and
the inactivated  xxxg1808xxx ) from the small molecules of the
adenylylation reaction mixture. the extent of gs modification was typically greater than 95%, as estimated by
comparing the amount of 32p incorporated into gs∼amp
with the quantity of gs used in the adenylylation reaction.
gs∼amp concentrations are stated as the monomer concentration, reflecting the concentration of the incorporated
r-phosphoryl group from atp.
reaction conditions for the ar assay were like those for
the  xxxg1808xxx  reaction, except that gs∼amp was used in place
of gs, pii and glutamine were absent except where their
inhibition was studied, atp was unlabeled, the r-ketoglutarate concentration was 1 mm, the kpi concentration was
5 mm, and pii-ump was present as indicated. reactions
were analyzed by the nitrocellulose filter method (12).
 xxxg913xxx  assay. conditions were as described
previously (15), using gs∼amp at 0.152 µm (dodecamer),
pii∼ump at 2 µm, and either  xxxg1808xxx  at 0.001 µm or at

binding of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  was stimulated by glutamine.
prior results indicated that the two activators of the at
activity, pii and glutamine, acted synergistically; the apparent
kact for either activator was reduced in the presence of the
other (12). however, neither this observation nor the simple
fact that glutamine activates the at activity and inhibits the
ar activity of  xxxg1808xxx  indicates that  xxxg1808xxx  itself contains a
regulatory site for glutamine. this is because the substrates
for adenylylation and deadenylylation (gs and gs∼amp)
contain a binding site for glutamine (the gs product site)
such that all glutamine effects on  xxxg1808xxx  activities could be
due to binding of glutamine to gs and gs∼amp. the kact
for glutamine for the at activity is sufficiently high (∼7
mm for the wild-type enzyme) that it was not practical to

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 13, 2007 4121
directly assess the binding of glutamine to either gs or
 xxxg1808xxx . kinetic methods can be used to distinguish whether
an activator binds to the enzyme or to the substrate (25),
but in the case of the  xxxg1808xxx  reaction, these kinetic methods
are impractical. the substrate for adenylylation, gs, is a
dodecamer of ∼600 kda and difficult to deliver in huge
excess. more importantly, at very low substrate (gs) levels,
the measurement of the gs∼amp product becomes unreliable. we therefore examined whether  xxxg1808xxx  contained a
glutamine regulatory site indirectly, by examining whether
glutamine affected the binding of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  in the absence
of gs.
three different binding assays were used to study the
interaction of pii and  xxxg1808xxx , based upon gel filtration
chromatography, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and
protein cross-linking. since these assays have a different
physical basis, it is expected that different results should be
obtained, depending on the properties of the protein-protein
interaction. in the gel filtration assay, as soon as a complex
becomes dissociated, the components begin to separate from
one another such that rebinding is limited. also, in the gel
filtration assay, the concentration of complexes and the
dissociated proteins is slowly reduced by diffusion. in the
nondenaturing gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the
complex moves through the gel, which consists of small
“chambers” where rebinding of dissociated components may
occur. such rebinding should be favored when the two
individual components move through the gel at a similar rate
and its level reduced when the mobility of the separate
components is vastly different. finally, the cross-linking
assay, which has been described previously for the interaction
of pii and nrii (22), results in a covalent linkage between
 xxxg1808xxx  and pii or pii-ump. there is no dissociation of
complexes in this assay, and cross-linked complexes accumulate over time. we found that glutamine was required
to observe the binding of pii and  xxxg1808xxx  in a gel filtration
assay (figure 3) and that glutamine was not required but
greatly enhanced the binding of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  in a nondenaturing gel electrophoresis assay (figure 4). glutamine was
not required for the cross-linking of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  (see below),
and thus, the cross-linking assay appears to be the most
sensitive of the three assays. nevertheless, prior control
experiments for the cross-linking procedure (22) and experiments to be described later suggest that even this assay
depends on the presence of a bona fide pii/pii-ump binding
site.
in the gel filtration assay (figure 3), mixtures of pii and
 xxxg1808xxx  were fractionated on sephadex g-100, which completely separated the two proteins when glutamine was not
present in the incubation mixture and throughout the column.
binding of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  was only observed when glutamine
was in the incubation mixture as well as equilibrated in the
column. this binding can be deduced in two ways; the  xxxg1808xxx 
protein eluted in an earlier fraction, and some pii was clearly
observable coeluting with  xxxg1808xxx  and shortly behind the
 xxxg1808xxx  peak.
the nondenaturing gel electrophoresis assay (protein
electrophoretic mobility shift assay) readily detected the
complex of pii and  xxxg1808xxx  (figure 4). under the conditions
that were used, the trimeric pii migrated as a well-defined
band, while the monomeric  xxxg1808xxx  migrated as a closely
spaced doublet band. the complex of the two proteins

presence or absence of glutamine and subjected to fractionation on a sephadex g-100 column, as described in experimental procedures.

migrated with significantly reduced mobility. this complex
formed a very sharp and darkly stained band when the
incubation mixture and the gel and electrophoresis buffer
contained glutamine (10 mm, figure 4a). in the absence of
glutamine, binding of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  could be detected, but
the complex did not form a sharp band (figure 4b). instead,
a smeared and somewhat diffuse band with a ragged top edge
was reproducibly obtained. thus, glutamine seemed to be
required for formation of a stable complex that could migrate
as a discrete band.
to demonstrate that the complex observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay indeed consisted of pii and
 xxxg1808xxx , we excised this complex from the nondenaturing gel,
extracted the proteins from the gel slice, and subjected the
mixture to separation by sds-page. as expected, the
complex consisted of pii and  xxxg1808xxx  (figure 4c,d). to
estimate the stoichiometry of the complex, we examined the
distribution of pii and  xxxg1808xxx  in complexed and uncomplexed
form when present at various concentrations (figure 4c and
data not shown). when present at a 1:1 ratio, most of the
 xxxg1808xxx  was found in the complex, and the mobility of the
complex was not altered when pii was in significant excess
(figure 4c). this suggests that the complex resulted from a
1:1 interaction. furthermore, the amount of pii that was
present in the complex could be estimated from the amount
of pii extracted from the gel slice containing the complex
(figure 4d), which also suggested that the stoichiometry was
1:1 under the conditions that were used.
since glutamine was required for detection of the interaction of pii and  xxxg1808xxx  by the gel filtration chromatography
assay and clearly influenced the binding of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  in
the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, both of which were
conducted in the absence of gs, we conclude that  xxxg1808xxx 
does indeed contain a glutamine site. in additional experiments to be published elsewhere, we observed that the
nondenaturing gel electrophoresis assay for protein interactions described here was also useful for detecting other
protein interactions. for example, we have used the assay
to study the interaction of e. coli pii and glnk with nrii

(ntrb) and the interaction of arabidopsis thaliana pii with
 xxxg1497xxx  (manuscripts in preparation). later in this report, we
will show that the assay can be used to detect interactions
between different truncated versions of  xxxg1808xxx . for each
interaction, optimization of conditions is required, yet neither
the gel filtration method nor the gel electrophoresis method
captures all pii interactions; we were not able to detect the
interaction of pii-ump with  xxxg1808xxx  by either method.
cross-linking of pii and pii-ump to  xxxg1808xxx . for these
studies, a mutant form of pii with a unique cysteine at
position 44 of the t-loop (c73s/e44c) was used (22). a
heterobifunctional cross-linker with a uv-activatable phenyl
azide at one end and a maleamide at the other was attached
to this cysteine, as described previously (22), and the ability
of pii and pii-ump so labeled to become cross-linked to
 xxxg1808xxx  upon uv exposure was investigated. uv-dependent
cross-linking of pii and pii-ump to  xxxg1808xxx  was clearly
observed, even in the presence of excess bsa (figure 5).
the cross-linking of pii to  xxxg1808xxx  did not require glutamine,
r-ketoglutarate, or atp, was stimulated by atp and
r-ketoglutarate at 20 µm, and was not strongly inhibited by
r-ketoglutarate  xxxd1891xxx  mm (figure 5a). similarly, crosslinking of pii-ump to  xxxg1808xxx  required uv exposure and
could be observed in the presence of excess bsa but was
only modestly stimulated by atp and r-ketoglutarate and
was unaffected by glutamine (figure 5b). thus, in both
cases, the cross-linking seemed to be specific but only weakly
regulated by the small molecule effectors. to be certain that
our pii-ump preparation was not contaminated with a
significant fraction of unmodified pii, we both examined the
preparation by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (where it
appeared to be completely modified; not shown) and tested
the ability of the material to become cross-linked to nrii,
which is readily cross-linked to unmodified pii (22). via
this functional assay, the pii-ump preparation seemed to
be fully modified, as no cross-linking to nrii was detected
(figure 5b).

procedures. (d) sds-14% polyacrylamide gel analysis of extracted proteins: (1) control sample with  xxxg1808xxx  and pii and (a-g) extracts

by a central region of ∼200 amino acids (figure 2). we
hyperexpressed and purified altered forms of  xxxg1808xxx  with
either truncations, an internal deletion, or clusters of point
mutations, as depicted in figure 2. the three n-terminal and
c-terminal truncations were designed to include various
portions of the central region of  xxxg1808xxx , and the four clusters
of point mutations were focused on different portions of the
central region. the internal deletion mutation removes 122
amino acids from the middle of the ∼200-amino acid central
region. finally, each of the putative nt active sites was
separately inactivated by mutation of both of the highly
conserved aspartates involved in the two-metal mechanism
to asparagine. the purified proteins that were obtained are
shown in figure s1 of the supporting information. the
truncated forms of  xxxg1808xxx  ranged from ∼80-90% pure
(atn1 and atc1) to ∼40% pure (atc3). the mutations
altering the active sites (cdn and ndn) did not dramatically
affect purification, but the other mutations altering the central

region of  xxxg1808xxx  affected the expression and/or purification
of the these proteins; final preparations of these proteins were
less pure than the wild-type protein (figure s1).
effect of mutations at the active sites. the active sites
for the highly conserved nt domains can be readily
recognized from the primary sequence; we engineered the
replacement of the two conserved aspartate resides with
asparagine within each nt domain. for the n-terminal nt
domain, aspartates 173 and 175 were converted, while for
the c-terminal nt domain, aspartates 701 and 703 were
converted, yielding the enzymes at-ndn and at-cdn,
respectively (figure 2). the purified at-cdn enzyme lacked
any discernible at activity (data not shown) but had ar
activity that was only slightly lower than that of the wild
type in the presence of pii-ump (figure 6a). like the wildtype enzyme, the at-cdn ar activity was inhibited by pii
and glutamine, and their concerted effect did not display
obvious synergy (figure 6a). in additional experiments, we

observed that the ar activity of at-cdn required pii-ump,
as did the wild-type enzyme (not shown), and that the
apparent kact of pii-ump for activation of the ar activity
was reduced for the at-cdn enzyme relative to the wild
type (table 1). also, the apparent kinhib for glutamine
inhibition of the ar activity was modestly increased relative
to that of the wild type (table 1). thus, alteration of the
c-terminal domain active site seemed to make pii-ump bind
better and glutamine bind worse.
the at-ndn enzyme had no discernible ar activity (not
shown) but retained at activity that was synergistically
activated by pii and glutamine (figure 6b) and weakly
inhibited by pii-ump (data not shown), like the wild-type
enzyme. in additional experiments, we saw that the apparent
kact values for glutamine (7.5 mm) and pii (1.2 µm) were
similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (table 1). thus, the
at activity of the at-ndn enzyme appeared to be regulated
normally.
both at-ndn and at-cdn appeared to bind pii like
wild-type  xxxg1808xxx  in the nondenaturing gel electrophoresis
assay (figure s2 of the supporting information).
effect of a 122-amino acid deletion in the central region
of  xxxg1808xxx . the atm∆ enzyme is missing amino acids 456577 from the central region of  xxxg1808xxx  (figure 2). this enzyme
completely lacked ar activity (not shown) but retained at
activity (figure 7). the atm∆ enzyme exhibited high basal
at activity in the absence of any activators, and this basal
activity was activated ∼5-fold by glutamine  xxxd1891xxx  mm
(figure 7). remarkably, the at activity of the atm∆
enzyme was inhibited by pii as well as by pii-ump,
regardless of whether r-ketoglutarate was at a low or high
concentration (figure 7a). that is, the mutation altering
 xxxg1808xxx  converted pii from an activator to an inhibitor.
inhibition of the at activity of the atm∆ enzyme by pii
was unaltered when glutamine was present  xxxd1891xxx  mm, but
inhibition by pii-ump was greatly weakened in the presence
of glutamine (figure 7a). in another experiment, we
observed that the inhibition by the combination of pii and
pii-ump was less than additive with reference to the
inhibition by either pii or pii-ump alone (figure 7b). these
observations suggested that pii and pii-ump might exert
their inhibitory effects from independent sites. in ref 26,
kinetic analysis of the inhibition of the atm∆ enzyme by
pii and pii-ump is presented, which is consistent with this
conclusion (26). the atm∆ enzyme appeared to bind pii

normally in the gel electrophoresis assay (figure s2) and
was cross-linked to pii and to pii-ump like the wild-type
enzyme in the cross-linking assay (figure s3 of the supporting information). thus, the central region of  xxxg1808xxx  was
not essential for pii/pii-ump binding, but its deletion
appeared to disprupt the communication between the pii/
pii-ump site(s) and the active sites, as well as the communication between the glutamine and pii sites. in another
experiment, we observed that the apparent glutamine kact
for activation of the at activity of atm∆ was ∼0.3 mm,
a remarkable 23-fold below that of the wild-type enzyme
(table 2). thus, the mutation also appeared to have a
significant effect on binding of glutamine to the enzyme.
clustered point mutations affecting the central region
of the  xxxg1808xxx . four different mutated enzymes containing
mutations in the central region were examined; each of these
contains several point mutants clustered into a small portion
of the central region (figure 2). our original purpose in
forming these mutations was to test portions of the central
region of  xxxg1808xxx  that bear some resemblance to the beta-hairpin
element of the c-terminal domain of nrii, implicated as
possibly forming part of the pii-binding site of nrii (19).
the mutant atm1 contains the d463n, p467a, and l469g
mutations. this enzyme had approximately one-half to onethird of the ar activity observed with the wild-type enzyme,
and this ar activity was inhibited by pii and by glutamine
like the wild-type enzyme (figure 8 and table 2). the atm1
enzyme also had approximately one-half to one-third of the
at activity when compared to the wild-type enzyme, and
this activity was regulated normally by glutamine, pii, and
pii-ump (figure 9 and table 2). the enzyme appeared to
bind pii normally in the gel electrophoresis assay (figure
s2) and was cross-linked to pii and pii-ump in the crosslinking assay (figure s3). thus, alteration of residues 463,
467, and 469 did not result in dramatic alterations of the
 xxxg1808xxx  activities or their regulation.
the atm2 enzyme contains the alterations r499a,
r501a, d505n, p509a, and l511g. this enzyme completely lacked ar activity (not shown) but retained at
activity (figure 9). like the atm∆ enzyme, atm2 exhibited significant basal at activity in the absence of any
activators, approximately equal to the activity obtained with
the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 1 mm glutamine
(not shown). this at activity was strongly activated by
glutamine, and reminiscent of the situation with the atm∆

preparation did not contain a significant concentration of unuridylylated pii.

protein, either pii or pii-ump inhibited the enzyme (figure
9). the atm2 enzyme retained some ability to bind pii as
indicated by the gel electrophoresis assay (figure s2) and
the cross-linking assay (figure s3). however, it should be
noted that in the gel electrophoresis assay, the appearance
of the  xxxg1808xxx -pii complex band resembled that typically
seen in the absence of glutamine (figure s2), yet the
glutamine apparent kact for the at activity of atm2 was
significantly lower than that observed with the wild-type
enzyme (table 2). the mutations in atm2 apparently block
communication between the glutamine and pii sites. the
atm2 protein was also slightly defective in cross-linking
to pii-ump (figure s3).
the atm3 enzyme contains the l525g, r527a, and
i528g mutations. this enzyme proved quite difficult to purify

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 13, 2007 4125
due to a low expression level, and the preparation we used
was only ∼40% pure (figure s1). the enzyme seemed to
completely lack ar activity but retained at activity (figure
9). basal at activity in the absence of any activators was
discernible; this at activity was strongly activated by
glutamine and weakly activated by pii, and the degree of
synergy between the two activators was lower than that
observed for the wild-type protein (figure 9). the at activity
of the atm3 enzyme was poorly inhibited by pii-ump
(figure 9). the enzyme seemed to bind pii normally in the
gel electrophoresis assay, but because of the poor purity of
the enzyme, this conclusion is tentative (figure s2). additional studies indicated that the apparent kact for glutamine
was significantly lower than that observed with the wildtype enzyme, and furthermore, the glutamine kact was not
decreased in the presence of pii (table 2), unlike the situation
obtained with the wild-type enzyme (12). thus, the mutations
in atm3 appear to strengthen the binding of glutamine,
weaken the binding of pii-ump, and alter the communication
between the pii site and the at active site, as well as
eliminating the ar activity.
the atm4 enzyme contains the alterations r571a,
p573a, and l575g. this enzyme exhibited approximately
one-eighth of the ar activity seen with the wild type; its
ar activity was inhibited by glutamine and pii (figure 9).
inhibition of the ar activity by glutamine seemed to be more
effective than that observed with the wild-type enzyme, and
the apparent kinhib for glutamine was a remarkable 0.4 mm,
or ∼50-fold below that observed with the wild-type enzyme
(table 2). the apparent pii-ump kact for activation of the
ar activity was increased relative to that of the wild-type
enzyme (table 2). the enzyme displayed discernible basal
at activity in the absence of any activators, and the at
activity was strongly activated by glutamine (figure 9). the
activation of the enzyme by glutamine seemed to saturate at
1 mm glutamine (not shown), and the apparent kact for
glutamine was a remarkable 0.4 mm, or ∼20-fold lower than
that obtained with the wild-type enzyme (table 2). the
enzyme bound normally to pii in the gel electrophoresis
assay (figure s2) and was cross-linked to pii normally in
the cross-linking assay (figure s3), but cross-linking to piiump may be modestly defective (figure s3). thus, the main
effect of the mutations in atm4 was to dramatically
strengthen the binding of glutamine to the enzyme, as well
as increasing the basal and glutamine-activated at activity.
activities of truncated forms of  xxxg1808xxx . the three cterminal fragments of  xxxg1808xxx  that we purified, atc1, atc2,
and atc3, contained various portions of the central region
of  xxxg1808xxx  and the c-terminal nt domain (figure 2 and figure
s1). all three of these polypeptides lacked ar activity (not
shown) and had at activity that was activated by glutamine
(shown for atc1 in figure 10 and table 2). for polypeptide
atc1, consisting of residues 425-946, these results were
expected, as it should be similar to a polypeptide produced
previously (15). the atc1 and atc3 polypeptides had
discernible basal at activity in the absence of any activators
(not shown), and these enzymes were strongly activated by
glutamine. atc2 was activated by glutamine in a manner
similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (not shown).
interestingly, the glutamine-stimulated at activity of
atc1 was weakly inhibited by pii and by pii-ump, and
concerted inhibition by pii and pii-ump seemed to be less

than additive (figure 10). in additional experiments, the
apparent kinhib values for pii-ump and pii were 8.5 and 13
µm, respectively, indicating poor binding of the enzyme by
pii and pii-ump. we observed that inhibition by pii did
not require r-ketoglutarate and was relatively insensitive to
the r-ketoglutarate concentration, being slightly increased
at 1 mm r-ketoglutarate (not shown). at a high glutamine
concentration (50 mm), inhibition by pii and by pii-ump
was significantly weakened, again, regardless of the r-ketoglutarate concentration (figure 10). these observations are
explored further in ref 26, where kinetic analysis of the atc1
at activity suggested that pii and pii-ump inhibit competitively with glutamine and that both pii and pii-ump act
from a common site (26). thus, atc1 seemed to interact
with pii and pii-ump, indicating the presence of a pii/piiump site that is between the c-terminus and position 425.
however, we could not detect the interaction using the gel
electrophoresis assay (not shown). binding of atc1 to pii
and pii-ump was readily observed in the cross-linking assay
(figures s4 and s5 of the supporting information).

the atc2 polypeptide contains a portion of the central
region of  xxxg1808xxx  and the c-terminal at domain. this
polypeptide had low basal at activity, which was activated
by glutamine (not shown). the enzyme was completely
unaffected by pii and pii-ump (not shown) and displayed
a glutamine apparent kact that was significantly lower than
that displayed by wild-type  xxxg1808xxx  (table 2). we could not
detect binding to pii or pii-ump by a gel electrophoresis
assay (not shown), or by the cross-linking assay when
coomassie blue-stained gels were used to monitor crosslinking (figures s4 and s5).
the atc3 polypeptide consists of essentially just the at
domain. the enzyme lacked ar activity and displayed a
discernible basal at activity, which was further activated
by glutamine (not shown). again, the apparent kact for
glutamine was lower than the expected value (table 2). the
enzyme seemed to be completely indifferent to the presence
of pii and pii-ump (not shown). binding of pii or pii-ump
was not detected by the gel electrophoresis assay or by the
cross-linking asssay when coomasie blue-stained gels were
used to monitor cross-linking (not shown).
the n-terminal polypeptides, atn1, atn2, and atn6,
were also purified. contrary to the expectations based on a
previous report (15), we could not measure ar activity with
any of our truncated versions, nor could we detect ar
activity with another truncated version (1-423) that was
identical to that reported previously (not shown). because
of this, we attempted to measure ar activity in crude
extracts, both by examining the regulation of gs activity,
as reported previously (15), and by directly examining the
deadenylylation of labeled gs∼amp. we were unable to
detect ar activity by either assay for any of the atn
constructs, including the construct identical to that reported
previously (15). as expected, none of the n-terminal
polypeptides displayed at activity (not shown). the largest
of the n-terminal polypeptides, atn6 (residues 1-608),

10 µm. the fraction of activity remaining was as follows: control (100%), +pii (37.6%), +pii-ump (61.5%), and +pii and pii-ump
(31.0%).

clearly bound pii in the gel electrophoresis assay, while
atn1 and atn2 failed to bind pii in this assay (not shown).
the atn6 and atn2 polypeptides were readily cross-linked
to pii in the cross-linking assay; atn6 was also cross-linked
to pii-ump, while atn2 was defective in cross-linking to
pii-ump (figures s4 and s5).
cross-linking of pii and pii-ump to truncated forms
of  xxxg1808xxx . the cross-linking experiments discussed so far
employed coomassie blue-stained gels for monitoring crosslinking. to have a more sensitive assessment of cross-linking
of pii and pii-ump to  xxxg1808xxx  and the various  xxxg1808xxx 
truncations, and to confirm the identity of the bands seen
on coomassie-stained gels, we used an immunoblotting
method to detect the formation of the cross-linked complexes
(figure 11). using this method, a very dense band corresponding to the cross-linked complex was obtained when
wild-type  xxxg1808xxx  was used (figure 11), and as expected on
the basis of the results with coomassie-stained gels (figures
s4 and s5), the atn6 polypeptide was well cross-linked to
both pii and pii-ump. by comparison, all of the truncation
polypeptides with the exception of atn6 exhibited weak
but clearly discernible cross-linking to pii (figure 11). the
atc1, atn1, and atn2 polypeptides also exhibited clear
cross-linking to pii-ump, while the atc2 and atc3
polypeptides exhibited very weak cross-linking to pii-ump
(figure 11). since the atn1 and atc3 polypeptides consist
mainly of the two conserved nt domains, these results
suggest that pii and pii-ump weakly interacted directly with
the nt domains.

glutamine, 10 µm pii-ump, and the r-ketoglutarate concentration increrased to 1 mm.

interactions of truncated forms of  xxxg1808xxx . because all of
the n-terminal truncations examined here lacked ar activity,
the possibility that these polypeptides were denatured or
improperly folded existed. to explore this possibility, we
examined the interactions of the truncated polypeptides with
each other, using the gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay.
no combination of polypeptides that contained overlapping
segments was found to interact, nor was an interaction
discernible between atn1 and atc1 or between atn2 and
atc2 (not shown). however, in the presence of glutamine,
a strong interaction was detected between atn6 (the longest
n-terminal truncation) and atc3 (the shortest c-terminal
truncation), which together comprise the  xxxg1808xxx  (figure s6
of the supporting information). this interaction did not
appear to prevent interaction of atn6 with pii, and indeed,
a complex could be excised from the mobility shift gels that
contained atn6, atc3, and pii (figure s6). thus, atc3
and atn6 display specific interaction with each other,
implying that they are both at least partially native. however,
as with atn6, the complex of atc3 and atn6 did not
display ar activity (not shown).

discussion
the  xxxg1808xxx  provides an example of a bifunctional enzyme
with antagonistic activities, each of which is regulated by
inhibitors and activators (27). here, we focus on the
regulation of the activities by pii, pii-ump, and glutamine
and on locating the sites from which these effectors work.
our results suggest that the enzyme is even more complex
than previously envisioned (15, 28). a hypothesis consistent
with the available data is presented in figure 12. we
hypothesize that the enzyme contains two sites for the
binding of pii and pii-ump, one associated with each of
the nt domains. the central region of  xxxg1808xxx  either forms
a portion of these sites or regulates the binding of pii and
pii-ump to these sites. we hypothesize that the binding of
pii is favored by the n-terminal pii/pii-ump site and that
the binding of pii-ump is favored by the c-terminal piiump/pii site. glutamine binds to a site that is probably
located on the c-terminal nt domain. all of the sites
communicate with each other; in the case of the glutamine
and pii sites, this communication requires proper interaction
of the at and ar domains of  xxxg1808xxx . we hypothesize that

figure 10: inhibition of atc1 at activity by pii and pii-ump. reactions were conducted as described in experimental procedures with
the following concentrations: 2.5 µm gs and 0.5 mm atp. pii, when present, was at a concentration of 10 µm, and pii-ump, when
present, was at a concentration of 10 µm.

the at and ar activities are mutually antagonistic, that the
c-terminal at domain must contribute to or activate the ar
activity of the n-terminal nt domain, and that this interaction can be disrupted by mutations in the central region of
 xxxg1808xxx .
while none of the points discussed above have been
proven, our data were consistent with this hypothesis and
inconsistent with the previous hypothesis (15). a suggestion
for multiple pii/pii-ump sites comes from the atm∆
enzyme, where both pii and pii-ump inhibited the at
activity in a less than additive fashion, with only inhibition
by pii-ump eliminated by glutamine. furthermore, the
atm2 and atm3 mutant enzymes were clearly defective
in communication between the pii site and the  xxxg1808xxx  active
site (and glutamine site). since these enzymes have mutations
in the central regions of the  xxxg1808xxx , this suggests that the
pii site and at active site may not reside on the same
domain. in the cross-linking assay, binding of pii to
polypeptides atc1 and atn6 could be clearly observed
on coomassie-stained gels. since these two peptides contain
the central region of  xxxg1808xxx , it would seem from these data
that pii and pii-ump bind to the central region. however,
deletion of most of the central region in the atm∆ enzyme
did not eliminate the binding of pii and pii-ump. furthermore, when immunoblotting was used to examine the
products of cross-linking, we observed weak cross-linking
of pii and pii-ump to the isolated nt domains. therefore,
it seems likely that the binding sites are located on the nt
domains themselves and that the central region either forms
a part of the sites or regulates the binding of pii/pii-ump
to the sites. since the atm∆ protein seems to have two
sites for pii/pii-ump, the 122 deleted central amino acids
of the central region of  xxxg1808xxx  probably do not contain either
site. thus, we hypothesize that the wild-type enzyme has
two pii/pii-ump sites, as depicted in figure 12. in ref 26,

these observations were followed up with a kinetic analysis
of the  xxxg1808xxx  that also suggested the presence of multiple
pii/pii-ump sites (26).
since the  xxxg1808xxx  substrate, gs, has a binding site for
glutamine, we studied the effect of glutamine on binding of
pii to the  xxxg1808xxx  to examine whether  xxxg1808xxx  also contained
a site for glutamine. glutamine affected the binding of  xxxg1808xxx 
to pii in the absence of gs, making it likely that the  xxxg1808xxx 
does have a glutamine site. the synergistic activation of the
at activity by glutamine and pii (12 and references cited
therein) seems to be due, at least in part, to the effect of
glutamine on pii binding. the glutamine site on  xxxg1808xxx  that
facilitates pii binding may or may not be the same site from
which glutamine activates the at activity. if it is the same
site, it is likely that this site is on the c-terminal nt domain,
as polypeptide atc3 exhibited at activity that was strongly
activated by glutamine. this conclusion is consistent with
previous structure-function studies of the  xxxg1808xxx  (15).
mutations in the central region could eliminate the ar
activity and result in elevated basal at activity in the absence
of any activators or block the activation of the at by pii.
thus, the central region played an important role in communication between the domains. since the atc series of
truncated enzymes exhibited at activity while none of the
n-terminal polypeptides exhibited ar activity, it seems that
the c-terminal at domain is sufficient for the at activity
and also plays a role in the activation of the ar activity.
pii-ump is an essential activator of the ar activity. we
hypothesize that pii-ump activates the ar activity by
binding to a pii-ump/pii site on the c-terminal domain and
that this domain must then interact with the n-terminal
domain for the ar activity to occur. since mutations in the
central region can block communication between the pii and
glutamine sites, we hypothesize that a pii/pii-ump site is
located on the n-terminal ar domain (figure 12).

figure 11: cross-linking of pii and pii-ump to truncated forms
of  xxxg1808xxx , as detected by immunoblotting with anti-pii. the
reactions and immunoblotting were performed as described in
experimental procedures. cross-linked species are marked with
black dots.

interestingly, pii-ump and glutamine appeared to be
directly antagonistic, as if they competed for the enzyme.
for example, a high concentration of glutamine blocked
inhibition of the atc1 at activity by pii-ump or pii, and
a high concentration of glutamine blocked inhibition of the
atm∆ at activity by pii-ump (but not by pii). these
observations are described further in the following paper,
where kinetic analysis indicated that glutamine and pii-ump
compete for binding the enzyme (26). furthermore, we show
in that work that pii and pii-ump are likely to act from a
common site to inhibit the at activity of atc1 and that
glutamine acts competitively with both pii and pii-ump
binding to this site (26). thus, atc1 seems to contain the
pii-ump site, whose specificity for pii-ump was reduced
by truncation of the rest of the protein. interestingly, the
mutations in the atm4 enzyme both elevated the pii-ump
apparent kact for the ar activity and reduced the glutamine
apparent kact for the at activity. it seems that in the atm4

enzyme, the c-terminal at domain conformation is altered
in a way that affects both pii-ump and glutamine binding.
conversely, but less dramatically, alteration of the at active
site within the c-terminal at domain decreased the piiump kact for the ar activity and increased the glutamine
kinhib for the ar activity. these observations suggested that
both the pii-ump site and glutamine site may map to the
c-terminal at domain.
as already noted, the glutamine activation of the at
activity of the atc3 polypeptide suggests that the glutamine
site maps to the c-terminal at domain of  xxxg1808xxx . it is
remarkable then that all of the c-terminal truncations and
three of the four enzymes altered in the central region of
 xxxg1808xxx  exhibited reduced apparent kact values for glutamine

structure-function analysis of  xxxg1808xxx 
activation of the at activity; in some cases, these apparent
kact values were quite dramatically reduced. this observation
suggests that the glutamine site in the native enzyme is in
communication with the other domains of the protein;
presumably, the mutations in the central part of the  xxxg1808xxx 
alter the glutamine site indirectly by altering the interactions
of the n-terminal and c-terminal domains.
according to our hypothesis, pii and pii-ump act as
activators by binding to the domain with the antagonistic
activity; that is, pii activates the at by binding to the ar
domain, and pii-ump activates the ar by binding to the
at domain (figure 12). we imagine that this binding alters
the conformation of the bound domain, and this is communicated to the other domain by direct interaction of the
nt domains. direct interaction between the  xxxg1808xxx  domains
is consistent with our observation of a strong and specific
interaction between the atn6 and atc3 polypeptides.
presumably, pii and pii-ump binding also inhibits the
activity of the domain to which it is bound. this is consistent
with the observation that pii and pii-ump inhibited the at
activity of the atc1 polypeptide.
prior studies have established that r-ketoglutarate binds
to pii and to pii-ump and regulates the ability of pii and
pii-ump to activate the at and ar reactions (12, 13). the
simplest explanation for those results is that r-ketoglutarate
regulates the ability of pii and pii-ump to bind to  xxxg1808xxx 
(29). although we did not focus on the role of r-ketoglutarate in this work, we did observe that this effector had little
effect on cross-linking of pii and pii-ump to  xxxg1808xxx . this
observation is described further in the following paper, where
kinetic analysis suggested that the binding of pii and piiump to  xxxg1808xxx  was not altered by r-ketoglutarate. rather,
this effector seemed to act at a postbinding step to regulate
the activity of pii and pii-ump (26).
the  xxxg1808xxx  is a complex enzyme that has resisted definition
for more than 30 years. our hypothesis makes several
predictions that may be directly tested in future experiments.
for example, mapping of the contacts of pii and pii-ump
with the enzyme, for instance, by using “zero-spacer” crosslinking and classical peptide mapping, should reveal two
different pii/pii-ump binding sites, and furthermore, when
the intact enzyme is used, the n-terminal site should have a
greater affinity for pii while the c-terminal site should have
a greater affinity for pii-ump. our hypothesis also predicts
that the synergy between glutamine and pii results from the
ability of either effector to propagate a conformational change
that alters the site on the opposite domain. also, the contacts
between the at and ar domains with each other or with
the central region should be different in the absence and
presence of pii-ump, as we hypothesize that in the later
situation the at domain plays a role in activating the ar
domain.
