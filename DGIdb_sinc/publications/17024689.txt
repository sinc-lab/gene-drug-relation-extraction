summary
purpose the objective of this study was to quantify the associations between nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors and risk for
initiating antihypertensive therapy.
methods we conducted a population-based case-control study in a large, integrated health system in the midwestern
united states. cases (n ¼ 23 562) were new users of antihypertensive therapy from 1, july 1997, through 31, january 2003.
controls (n ¼ 23 562) were randomly selected and matched to cases on age, copay, medical care utilization, sex, and index
date. the main outcome measures were exposure to nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors.
results recent prescription nsaid use was associated with an increased risk for initiation of antihypertensive therapy
(odds ratio (or) ¼ 1.6, 95%ci 1.5, 1.7) as were selective cox-2 inhibitors (or ¼ 1.8, 95%ci 1.6, 2.1). after adjusting for
age, sex, co-payment, race, and exposure to other nsaids/cox-2, each non-selective nsaid (diclofenac, ibuprofen,
indomethacin, naproxen,  xxxd2807xxx ) was associated with an increased risk of antihypertensive therapy initiation, with ors
ranging from 1.4 to 1.8. recent users of cox-2 inhibitors had an increased risk of initiating antihypertensive therapy,
regardless of speciﬁc drug (celecoxib adjusted or ¼ 1.7 (95%ci 1.3, 2.1); rofecoxib adjusted or ¼ 1.7 (95%ci 1.4, 1.9)).
conclusions a consistent increased risk of initiation of antihypertensive therapy was observed among recent users of
nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors. unlike previous studies, the results indicate that the effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib are
equivalent. copyright # 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.

effects of nsaids,2–4 clinical and research evidence
indicate that nsaids and cox-2 may impact blood
pressure, directly5–9 or by interaction with antihypertensive agents.7,10,11
clinical studies provide mixed messages, some
showing nsaids have no blood pressure effect, with
others indicating that nsaids and cox-2 increase
mean blood pressure.12,13 a 52-week study of oncedaily rofecoxib showed small, dose-related increases
of diastolic and systolic bp (1 mmhg and 3 mmhg,

nsaids and htn
14

respectively). head-to-head comparisons of rofecoxib and celecoxib in hypertensive osteoarthritis
patients showed a slight mean systolic blood pressure
increase in the rofecoxib group at 6 weeks, compared
to a slight decrease in the celecoxib group.15,16 in one
of the studies, 10% of both treatment groups
experienced clinically important changes in systolic
blood pressure at any trial visit.16
population-based studies have shown an association
between nsaids and hypertension. gurwitz et al.5
determined that the use of non-selective prescription
nsaids increased the risk for initiation of antihypertensive therapy (or ¼ 1.66) in medicaid enrollees over 65 years of age. this effect was highest in
high-dose, recent nsaid users and was consistent for
all non-selective nsaids studied except  xxxd2423xxx .
more recently, two studies conducted using the
nurses’ health study cohort showed an increased
risk of hypertension in users of acetaminophen and
nsaids.6,8
rofecoxib was ﬁrst associated with an increased
risk of acute myocardial infarction (mi) in the vigor
study,17 which showed a ﬁve-fold increase in the risk
of mi compared with naproxen. this ﬁnding was
reinforced in several epidemiologic studies18–20 and
later in the approve trial.21 rofecoxib was
voluntarily withdrawn from the market in september
2004, after approve results indicated that doses of
25 mg increased the relative risk of conﬁrmed
cardiovascular events after 18 months or more of
use.22 while most studies investigating the association
between celecoxib exposure and cardiovascular risk
showed no strong effect20,23 in december 2004, results
from the randomized apc study reported that high
doses of celecoxib resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold
increase in the combined endpoint of fatal or non-fatal
cardiovascular events.24
it is important to understand the full range of
cardiovascular risks of the cox-2 selective inhibitors
and the differences between them. this paper assesses
the risk of hypertension in rofecoxib, celecoxib and
non-selective nsaids users and provides information
on the level of risk for each of the drugs.

nonproﬁt health plan, including a large mixed-model
health maintenance organization (hmo). to optimize
the computerized data available for this study, the
population was limited to health plan members
assigned to medical group physicians. during the
study period, the health system had no formulary
restrictions on nsaids or cox-2 selective inhibitors.
this study was approved by the medical group
institutional review board (irb).
computerized data sources and medical records
the health system maintains a centralized system of
computerized databases. data for this study primarily
came from electronic and paper medical record review
and three computerized databases: (1) the membership
ﬁle; (2) the outpatient pharmacy database; and (3) the
encounter and claims databases.
the membership database includes information on
coverage dates, beneﬁts, and co-payments. the
pharmacy database contains information on outpatient
prescriptions ﬁlled by members. to receive payment,
contracted pharmacies, including several major
chains, must ﬁle a claim for each prescription ﬁlled.
this database includes information on date member
ﬁlled prescription, drug name, national drug code
(ndc), number of pills, dosage dispensed, and days
supply. because this database captures all prescriptions paid by the plan (regardless of pharmacy
location) and pharmacies will not be paid unless a
claim is submitted, these data are of high quality.
the encounter and claims databases include
comprehensive patient data for outpatient, emergency
department, and inpatient care delivered. for each
outpatient encounter, information on date of visit,
diagnoses, physician delivering care, procedures
delivered, and clinic in which the care was delivered
is compiled. likewise, for each inpatient stay,
information on admission and discharge date, diagnoses, and procedures is compiled. finally, inpatient
and outpatient medical records are maintained in both
traditional paper format and electronic format.
study population

methods
data sources and study population
we conducted a case-control study sampling from a
population of subjects identiﬁed from a large
integrated health system in the midwestern united
states. the health system includes an owned multispecialty, salaried, physician group afﬁliated with a
copyright # 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.

using the computerized databases described above,
we identiﬁed cases (as ﬁlling a new anti-hypertensive
prescription) and matched controls from the base
population of individuals who were, at one time, nonusers of antihypertensive therapy and continuously
enrolled in the health system for at least 1 year
sometime during the study period 1, july 1996,
through 21, january 2003.

identiﬁcation of cases
to identify all incident anti-hypertensive users, we
selected all individuals 20 years of age or older who
ﬁlled a prescription for an antihypertensive medication (including ace inhibitors, alpha blockers, beta
blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics
(including loop diuretics)) any time during the study
period 1, july 1997, through 31, january 2003, with no
previous antihypertensive ﬁlled within 1 year. the
date that the patient ﬁlled the ﬁrst antihypertensive
prescription was termed the ‘index date’. from this
group of new users, we excluded individuals who were
not continuously enrolled for at least 1 year before the
index date. because these drugs are also used to treat
conditions other than hypertension, we excluded
patients who did not have an icd-9-coded encounter
indicative of hypertension (401–401.9). therefore,
only treated patients with a hypertension diagnosis
were included as cases.
identiﬁcation of controls
controls were randomly selected from the base
population of health system members who did not
ﬁll an antihypertensive prescription during the study
period. one control was sampled for each case,
matched to the case on the following variables: age
( 2 years); co-payment; sex; index date (i.e., the
index date for the case was the reference point for
the matched control). in addition, because the
hypertension cases encountered the health system at
the time of the index date, controls were required to
have an encounter with the health system within
30 days of the case’s index date. we excluded as
controls individuals who had an icd-9-coded diagnosis for hypertension within 1 year before the index
date. like the cases, controls not continuously
enrolled in the health system for at least 1 year
before the index date were excluded from the study.
ascertainment and classiﬁcation of nsaid and
cox-2 exposure
from the outpatient pharmacy database, we downloaded all nsaid and cox-2 prescriptions ﬁlled. we
classiﬁed a patient as exposed to pharmacotherapy
only if they ﬁlled a prescription for at least a 30-day
supply, and formed the following exposure categories:
recent use: nsaid or cox-2 use within the 60-day
period before the index date; former use: nsaid or
cox-2 use within 1 year before the index date, but
supply ended more than 60 days before the index date;
copyright # 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.

et al.

non-use: less than 30-day supply or no prescriptions
ﬁlled within 1 year before the index date.
medical record review
we conducted medical record review for a random
sample of 450 patients (225 cases and 225 matched
controls). this record review collected data on height,
weight, smoking, and blood pressure readings
obtained and recorded during the study period.
data analysis
we conducted all analyses using sas statistical
software version 8.1 (sas institute, inc., cary, north
carolina).25 we calculated odds ratios (or) and
corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals (ci) to
estimate the relative risk of initiation of antihypertensive therapy among recent users of nsaids/cox-2
and former users of nsaids/cox-2 compared to
nonusers. to control confounding, we ﬁt a multiple
logistic regression model controlling for age, copayment, and number of visits in the year before the
index date (as continuous variables); sex (male/
female); and race (african american vs. caucasian/
other). we also ﬁt a multiple logistic regression
model, evaluating the independent effect of individual
nsaids/cox-2s. in this analysis, in addition to the
variables listed above, we also controlled for exposure
to other nsaids/cox-2 inhibitors.
we conducted analysis using conditional logistic
regression (to account for matching) and found that
the results and conclusions were the same when
unconditional logistic regression was used. therefore,
we present results from the unconditional model,
thereby simplifying the analysis and presentation and
allowing evaluation of the matching factors if needed.
results
we identiﬁed 55,337 cases with a ﬁlled prescription
for an antihypertensive medication during the period
1, july 1997, through 31, january 2003, and no
previous antihypertensive prescription ﬁlled within
1 year. from these cases, we excluded 15,921
individuals (29%) who were not continuously enrolled
in the health system for at least 1 year before the index
date, and also excluded 15,417 patients (28%) who did
not have an icd-9-coded encounter indicative of
hypertension. for each of these cases, we randomly
sampled one control matched on age, sex, co-payment,
and encounter with health system within 30 days of the
index date. among the 23,999 eligible cases, we could

not identify a control for 437 patients (1.8%; mainly
due to the visit-related criteria in the older age groups
for whom limited numbers of eligible controls were
available). table 1 shows the demographics of the ﬁnal
study sample of 47,124 patients (23,562 cases and
23,562 controls).
the mean duration of exposure to nsaids was 86.0
days and the mean duration of exposure to cox-2
selective inhibitors was 100.0 days (97.3 days for
rofecoxib and 81.0 days for celecoxib). the distribution of nsaid and cox-2 exposure among the
cases and controls is shown in table 2. as can be seen
in table 2, after adjusting for age, sex, copayment,
race, and number of visits to the health system during
the year before the index date, recent users of nsaids
or cox-2 were 1.6 times more likely to initiate
antihypertensive therapy when compared to non-users
(95%ci 1.5, 1.7). this increased risk was seen for both
recent users of nsaids (or ¼ 1.6 (95%ci 1.5, 1.7)
and cox-2s (or ¼ 1.8 (95%ci 1.6, 2.1). no
increased risk of initiation of antihypertensive
pharmacotherapy was seen among former users.
table 3 presents results according to speciﬁc
nsaid or cox-2 exposure. drugs were selected
for this analysis if more than 300 patients were
exposed to the speciﬁc drug during the study period.

medical record review sub-analysis
we conducted medical record review on a random
sample of 225 cases and their 225 matched controls to
obtain data on blood pressure measurements (to
determine the prevalence of unrecorded hypertension
among controls) and potential confounding factors
(height, weight and smoking). among the 225
controls, three patients (1.3%) had at least one
elevated blood pressure measurement (systolic
140 or diastolic 90) within 180 days of the index
date. these ﬁndings indicate that 1.3% of controls
were misclassiﬁed in this study.

impact of this potential misclassiﬁcation, we conducted an analysis assuming that 1.3% of controls in

the results. therefore, we proceeded with analyses
using automated data (in which bmi and information
on smoking were not available).
potential impact of pharmacy utilization
the endpoint in this study, initiation of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy, requires that a patient ﬁll a
prescription and that this prescription is billed to the
health system. likewise, the exposures in this study,
nsaid and cox-2 use, require that patients ﬁll a
prescription that is billed to the health system. in order
to evaluate whether the results of this study were due
to the possibility that nsaid exposure was a surrogate
for pharmacy utilization, we conducted a sub-analysis
limiting the population to individuals who ﬁlled at
least one prescription for any medication within 1 year
before the index date (excluding the antihypertensive
prescription among cases). this analysis (n ¼ 18,122
cases, 16,458 controls) provided results similar to
those found for the entire study population (crude or
for recent nsaid or cox-2 use ¼ 1.5 (95%ci 1.4,
1.6).
potential impact of over-the-counter (otc)
nsaid use
because nsaids are available otc, we evaluated
the potential effect that misclassiﬁcation of otc
nsaid use may have on the results of this study.
in previous work using data from patient interview, we
determined that up to 15% of the health system
population uses otc nsaids.26 assuming this
extreme distribution (i.e., that 15% of cases and
15% of controls classiﬁed as non-users in this study
were actually otc nsaid users), nsaids remain
associated with initiation of antihypertensive therapy
(crude or ¼ 1.3, 95%ci 1.25, 1.37).

conclusions
we conducted a population-based study in a realworld setting to evaluate the effect of nsaids and
cox-2 inhibitors on initiation of antihypertensive
therapy. our ﬁndings indicate a strong and consistent
association between recent exposure to nsaids or
cox-2 inhibitors and initiation of antihypertensive
therapy. among the non-selective nsaids, the effect
was lowest for recent users of diclofenac (or ¼ 1.4,
95%ci 1.0, 1.9) and highest among recent users of

effect in our study was identical for recent users of
celecoxib (or ¼ 1.7, 95%ci 1.3, 2.1) and rofecoxib
(or ¼ 1.7, 95%ci 1.4, 1.9), after adjusting for age,
sex, copayment, race, number of visits, and exposure
to other nsaids/cox-2 inhibitors.
most information regarding the potential effect of
nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors is derived from clinical
trials with limited numbers of patients, and subsequent
meta- analyses of these trials.9,13 some populationbased epidemiologic studies have been conducted on
non-selective nsaids using automated data5 and
questionnaires.6,8 although the literature to date is not
deﬁnitive, most studies indicate, in general, that nonselective nsaids are associated with increased blood
pressure and increased risk of hypertension. however,
much less information is known about selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors. many studies have concluded that, when
compared to celecoxib, rofecoxib is more likely to
increase blood pressure or lead to initiation of
therapy,7,15,27 while others propose that these differences between selective cox-2 inhibitors may be due
to underlying characteristics of the study populations
or suboptimal study methods.12
in terms of rofecoxib use, our ﬁndings are similar to
those of solomon et al.,27 who found that, in a low-tomoderate income elderly population, rofecoxib users
had an increased risk of initiating antihypertensive
therapy compared to non-users (or ¼ 1.6, 95%ci
1.3–2.0). however, our results differ for celecoxib
users; solomon et al. found no difference in risk for
hypertension comparing celecoxib users to patients
unexposed to nsaids or cox-2 selective inhibitors
(or ¼ 1.0, 95%ci 0.9–1.2). one possible explanation
for this discrepancy is the fact that our study included
patients who were exposed to both nsaid and cox-2
selective inhibitors during the study period, and
adjusted for previous exposure in the analysis. patients
exposed to both classes were excluded from the
solomon study. to evaluate the potential impact that
this difference may have, we brieﬂy reviewed our data
and found that, in our population, 55% of rofecoxib
users and 64% of celecoxib users were exposed to an
nsaid or a different cox-2 selective inhibitor during
the study period. as a result, the base population of
exposed patients in our study differed from that
of solomon et al., with potentially a larger number of
celecoxib users excluded from the solomon study due
to crossover. another difference between our studies is
that we required at least 30 days exposure to an
nsaid or cox-2, while no minimum exposure was
required by solomon et al.

hypertension conducted by sowers et al. compared the
effect of 200 mg/day celecoxib, 25 mg/day rofecoxib
and 1000 mg/day naproxen. this study found that after
12 weeks, rofecoxib exposed patients experienced
mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure increases
(3.7 mmhg increase), while celecoxib and naproxen
exposed patients did not experience increases in mean
blood pressure compared to baseline.28 this study also
found that after 6 weeks of treatment, 30.1% of
rofecoxib-exposed patients who were normotensive at
baseline became hypertensive at 6 weeks, compared
with 16.2% of celecoxib patients and 19.3% of
naproxen patients. while the results demonstrated that
rofecoxib users were almost two times more likely to
develop hypertension compared with celecoxib users,
the results also indicated that 16% of celecoxibexposed patients became hypertensive.
potential mechanisms by which non-selective
nsaids may affect blood pressure have been
proposed and discussed. as described by frishman,12
nsaids may lead to changes in blood pressure by
inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, and the relative
contribution of  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 in this process is
unknown. our results suggest a pharmacologic effect
of both selective nsaids and non-selective cox-2
based upon the consistency of the ﬁndings among
current users and the lack of effect among former users
(i.e., patients with nsaid or cox-2 exposure ending
at least 60 days before the index date).
this observational study is potentially limited by
several sources of bias that must be addressed. first,
this study relied upon prescription claims data to
measure exposure to nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors as
well as exposure to antihypertensive therapy. therefore, although we know from these data that the patient
ﬁlled a prescription, we do not know for a fact that
they took the prescribed medication. however, studies
have demonstrated that patients are likely to take a
medication after a prescription is ﬁlled.29 second,
because this study relied on prescription claims to
measure both exposure and antihypertensive outcome,
we evaluated the hypothesis that the ﬁndings in this
study were not due to a pharmacologic effect but
resulted because both exposure and outcome required
pharmacy utilization. however, when we conducted
an analysis limiting the study population to patients
who ﬁlled at least one prescription for any medication
during the year before the index date, the results did
not substantially change. in this study, we were unable
to evaluate the potential limitation that health care
providers may be more likely to monitor patients
exposed to nsaids and, therefore, treat the condition
sooner. however, given the limited and inconclusive

et al.

literature on this topic, this possibility should not
explain our ﬁndings.
an additional limitation of this study is the fact that
certain non-selective nsaids are available otc. in
our study, individuals who use otc nsaids will be
classiﬁed as unexposed to nsaids because their use
will not be recorded in the claims database. using
results from a patient interview during a previous
study of nsaid use in this study population,20 we
applied the estimated 15% otc exposure prevalence
to the study results. we found that missed otc
exposure would diminish the overall effect estimates,
although an overall increased risk for nsaids would
remain. in addition, it is important to note that three of
the nsaids highlighted in this study (indomethacin,
 xxxd2807xxx , and diclofenac) are not available otc, nor
are the cox-2 inhibitors. another issue to consider is
that cox-2 selective inhibitors were not clinically
available in 1997 and 1998. to evaluate whether this
fact potentially biased our results, we conducted a
subanalysis, limiting the study period to 1999–2003.
the results of this subanalysis and the conclusions
remained the same.
in order to identify newly diagnosed hypertensive
cases, this study relied upon icd-9 coded diagnoses of
hypertension in addition to claims-based pharmacotherapy data. as a result, the control group
(classiﬁed as non-hypertensive) may have elevated
blood pressure clinically deﬁnable as hypertension
and not treated with pharmacotherapy (because
therapy was not prescribed or a prescription was
not ﬁlled). we conducted medical record review to
evaluate the impact of this potential bias and found no
substantial difference in the effect estimate. because
we required an icd-9 coded diagnosis of hypertension
in addition to receipt of pharmacotherapy, 28% of
patients receiving pharmacotherapy did not meet the
hypertension case deﬁnition. if these patients actually
had hypertension and have a distribution of nsaid
and cox-2 selective inhibitor exposure different from
that found in the hypertension cases included in this
study, our results may be biased.
obesity is a potentially important source of bias in
this study because these patients may be more likely to
be exposed to the analgesics in this study and are also
more likely to develop hypertension. however, when
we adjusted for body mass index in our sub-sample,
the results did not change.
in summary, because nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors are frequently used medications, particularly in
the elderly population in which the baseline risk of
cardiovascular events is increased, potential adverse
effects of these therapies may have considerable

key points
 recent users of nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors
had an increased risk of initiation of antihypertensive therapy in this study.
 the results of this research indicate that the
effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib are equivalent,
in contrast to results of previous studies.
consequences. our results indicate that users of
nsaids and selective cox-2 inhibitors are more
likely to initiate antihypertensive therapy when
compared to non-users or previous users. we found
no difference in risk between celecoxib and rofecoxib.
the effect of these medications appears to diminish
when the drug is discontinued, with no increased risk
found in former users. because nsaids and cox-2
inhibitors often represent chronic treatment, clinicians
should be aware of the potential risks and appropriately monitor their patients. in light of the recent
withdrawal of rofecoxib from worldwide markets due
to serious cardiovascular events,30 it is critical to
completely understand whether these outcomes are
restricted to a particular drug, the cox-2 class, or all
nsaids.
