abstract
the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of ochratoxin a (ota) transport by
multispecific human organic anion transporters ( xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx , respectively) using the second
segment of proximal tubule (s2) cells from mice stably expressing  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  (s2  xxxg2113xxx  and
s2  xxxg2115xxx ). s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx  exhibited a time- and dose-dependent, and a saturable increase in
uptake of [3h]-ota, with apparent km values of 0.42 mm ( xxxg2113xxx ) and 0.75 mm ( xxxg2115xxx ). these ota
uptakes were inhibited by several substrates for the oats. para-aminohippuric acid (pah), probenecid,
 xxxd2969xxx , octanoate and citrinin inhibited [3h]-ota uptake by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  in a competitive
manner (ki 5 4.29z3080 mm), with the following order of potency: probenecid . octanoate . pah .
 xxxd2969xxx  . citrinin for  xxxg2113xxx ; probenecid .  xxxd2969xxx  . octanoate. citrinin . pah for  xxxg2115xxx .
these results indicate that  xxxg2113xxx , as well as  xxxg2115xxx , mediates a high-affinity transport of ota on the
basolateral side of the proximal tubule, but  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota transport are differently influenced by the substrates for the oats. these pharmacological characteristics of  xxxg2113xxx  and
 xxxg2115xxx  may be significantly related with the events in the development of ota-induced nephrotoxicity
in the human kidney. © 2001 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

cereals, nuts and coffee beans, with ota has been noted in east and central europe, north
africa, north america and japan (2). recently, ota has received considerable attention,
because of its deleterious effects on human and animal health. ota accumulates in several
tissues in the body, and the kidney being the main target, where it exerts toxic and carcinogenic effects (3). three forms of human renal disease, seem to be also caused, at least in part,
by enhanced ota exposure: balkan endemic nephropathy, chronic interstitial nephritis and
karyomegaric interstitial nephritis (4). however, the pathophysiological role of ota in human
renal disease has still not been completely determined.
in the kidney, ota mainly impairs the proximal tubular functions and causes glucosuria,
enzymuria and a decrease in the para-aminohippuric acid (pah) transport (5–7). an in vivo
study revealed that probenecid, a typical inhibitor of the renal organic anion transporter
(oat), inhibited the renal clearance of ota (8). in addition, glomerular filtration of ota is
considered to be minimal, since more than 99% of ota is bound to plasma proteins (9,10).
from these results, it is thought that the excretion of ota into the urine is mainly by tubular
secretion, presumably via the oat system, and this may play an important role in ota accumulation and development of nephrotoxicity. thus, knowledge on the fate of ota that has
reached the tubular lumen for its elimination is of crucial importance to understand how ota
is accumulated in the renal tubular cells and to develop possible strategies for prevention of
ota-induced nephrotoxicity.
two different types of human multispecific oats ( xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx ) were recently isolated in our laboratory (11). in the kidney,  xxxg2113xxx  as well as  xxxg2115xxx , is localized on the basolateral side of the proximal tubule (11). since  xxxg2113xxx , as well as  xxxg2115xxx , mediates the transport of various drugs, endogenous substances and xenobiotics, these transporters are
considered as the classical oats responsible for the basolateral uptake of organic anions in
renal epithelial cells. in the renal tubules, the major cellular targets of ota are the second
(s2) and third (s3) segments of the proximal tubule in the kidney (12). considering these
points, the present study investigated the pharmacological characteristics of ota transport
by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  using s2 cells stably expressing  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  (s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2
 xxxg2115xxx , respectively).
methods
material
[3h]-ota (547.6gbq/mmol) was purchased from moravek biochemicals inc. (brea, ca).
unlabeled ota was obtained by purification as previously described (12). unless stated
otherwise, all other chemicals were obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis mo, usa).
cell culture and establishment of s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx 
s2 cells, derived from transgenic mice harboring the temperature-sensitive simian virus 40
large t-antigen gene, were established as described previously by us (13). the full-length
cdnas of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  were subcloned into pcdna 3.1 (in vitrogen, san diego, ca,
usa), a mammalian expression vector. s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx  were obtained by transfecting s2 cells with pcdna3.1- xxxg2113xxx , pcdna3.1- xxxg2115xxx  coupled with psv2neo, a neomycin-

resistant gene using a liposome (13). s2 cells transfected with pcdna3.1 lacking an insert
and psv2neo were designated as s2 pcdna 3.1 and used as a control. these cells were
grown in a humidified incubator at 338c and 5% co2, using ritc 80-7 medium (iwaki co.,
tokyo, japan) that contained 5% of fetal bovine serum, 10 mg/ml of transferrin, 0.08 u/ml of
insulin, 10 ng/ml of recombinant  xxxg681xxx  and 400 mg/ml of  xxxd2191xxx  (13).
the cells were subcultured in a medium containing 0.05% trypsin-edta solution (containing in mm: 137 nacl, 5.4 kcl, 5.5 glucose, 4 nahco3, 0.5 edta and 5 hepes; ph 7.2) and
used for 60z100 passages. clonal cells were isolated using a cloning cylinder, and screened
by determining the optimal substrate for each transporters, i.e., [14c]-pah for  xxxg2113xxx  (11)
and [3h]- xxxd2046xxx  for  xxxg2115xxx  (unpublished observation).
immunohistochemical analysis of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  proteins
light-microscopic analysis of the  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  proteins was performed as previously described (14). s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx  were cultured in a six-well dish. the cells
were fixed with paraformaldehyde lysine periodate (plp) solution (containing 0.01 m naio4,
0.075 m lysine, 0.0375 m phosphate buffer and 2% paraformaldehyde; ph 6.2) for 2 hrs at 48c.
after fixation, the cells were washed with 50 mm nh4cl in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs)
(containing in mm: 136 nacl, 2.7 kcl, 8.2 na2hpo4 ? 12h2o and 15 kh2po4, ph 7.4) and
then with tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% tween 20 (tbst). the cells were incubated
with polyclonal antibodies against  xxxg2113xxx  or  xxxg2115xxx  at a dilution of 1: 400 for 2 hrs. after
rinsing with tbst, the cells were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies against
rabbit immunoglobulin (lsab kit, dako, carpinteria, ca) for 1 hr. the cells were washed
with tbst, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated streptavidine solution for 30 min. hrp labeling was detected using a peroxidase substrate solution, 0.8 mm diaminobenzidine. then the cells were postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in pbs for 30 min
and embedded in epoxy resin. sections (0.5 mm) were cut on an ultramicrotome and observed
under a light microscope.
uptake experiment
uptake experiments were performed as previously described (14). as described above,
the cells were cultured at 338c, which is suitable for cell growth for cells encoding the
temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large t-antigen gene (13). in contrast, uptake experiments were performed at 378c, which is commonly used for evaluating transporter activities.
there has been no difference in the mount of uptake between 338c and 378c (data not
shown). based on these, the cells were cultured at 338c, whereas uptake experiments were
performed at 378c. the s2 monolayer was determined to be leaky based on the results of a
study wherein we estimated paracellular secretion from cells cultured on a permeable support, using d-[3h]-mannitol as an indicator. therefore, the cells were cultured on a solid
support for these experiments. the s2 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at a
cell density of 1 3 105cells/well. after the cells were cultured for two days, the cells were
washed three times with dulbecco’s modified phosphate-buffered saline (d-pbs) solution
(containing in mm: 137 nacl, 3 kcl, 8 nahpo4, 1 kh2po4, 1 cacl2 and 0.5 mgcl2; ph 7.4)
containing 5 mm d-glucose, and then preincubated with the same solution for 10 min in a
water bath at 378c. the cells were then incubated in d-pbs containing 5 mm d-glucose with

2126

k.y. jung et al. / life sciences 69 (2001) 2123–2135

[3h]-ota as indicated in each experiment. the uptake was stopped by the addition of icecold d-pbs, and the cells were washed three times with the same solution. the cells in each
well were lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.1n sodium hydroxide and 2.5 ml of aquasol-2, and radioactivity was determined using a b-scintillation counter (aloka, lsc-3100).
inhibition study
to evaluate the inhibitory effects of several substrates for an oat on ota uptake, s2
 xxxg2113xxx  or s2  xxxg2115xxx  were incubated for 2 min in d-pbs containing 1 mm [3h]-ota in the
absence or presence of inhibitors (0.2 mm) as described above. indomethacin was firstly dissolved in ethanol and diluted with d-pbs.  xxxd2969xxx , citrinin, octanoate and aspartame were
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and diluted with the incubation medium. the final
concentration of ethanol and dmso was adjusted to less than 0.1%, which did not affect the
 xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota uptake in our system.
kinetic analysis
after preincubation as described above, s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx  were incubated for 1
min in d-pbs containing different concentrations of [3h]-ota in the absence or presence
of inhibitors. the concentrations of the inhibitors used are listed in the table. on the basis of
[3h]-ota uptake under each condition, double reciprocal plot analyses were performed as
previously described (15). when the inhibition was found to be competitive, ki values were
calculated based on the following equation, ki 5 concentration of inhibitor/[(km ota with
inhibitor/km ota without inhibitor)-1].
statistical analysis
data are expressed as the mean 6 s.e.m. statistical differences were determined using
student’s unpaired t-test. differences were considered significant at p,0.05.

not shown). vertical sections of s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx  show that the subcellular localization of  xxxg2113xxx  or  xxxg2115xxx  protein is mainly on the cell membrane (figs. 1c, d). both the basolateral and apical portions of the membrane show positive staining (figs. 1c, d).
ochratoxin a uptake
to evaluate the time-dependent uptake of ota in s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx , s2 cell monolayers were incubated with 4 mm [3h]-ota for various periods at 378c. the values were
obtained by subtracting the values for the uptake in s2 pcdna 3.1 from those in s2  xxxg2113xxx  or
s2  xxxg2115xxx . as shown in fig. 2, the specific uptake of [3h]-ota increased linearly up to 3
min, followed by a steady-state level for both s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx . the kinetics of ota
uptake was examined to evaluate the pharmacological characteristics of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx 
on the ota transport. the specific uptake of [3h]-ota in s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx  revealed
saturable kinetics (fig. 3a), and the eadie-hofstee plot gave a single straight line (fig. 3b).
the estimated km values of organic anion transport by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  were 0.4260.03
mm and 0.7560.06 mm, respectively (n54). the results suggest that both  xxxg2113xxx  and
 xxxg2115xxx  are responsible for a high-affinity transport of ota.
inhibitory effects on ota uptake
the pharmacological characteristics of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  for ota transport were further
clarified by using various drugs, which are considered as a substrate for oats (16–18). as
shown in fig. 4, compounds (0.2 mm) tested here inhibited the [3h]-ota (1 mm) uptake

at different ratios. significant inhibition of [3h]-ota uptake in s2  xxxg2113xxx  was observed in
the substrates tested except aspartame, i.e., pah, probenecid,  xxxd2969xxx , octanoate,  xxxd2871xxx , cimetidine and indomethacin (pah, probenecid,  xxxd2969xxx , octanoate, citrinin,  xxxd2871xxx , cimetidine and indomethacin: n54, p,0.01 vs. control; citrinin: n54, p,0.05 vs.
control). similarly, drugs other than aspartame significantly inhibited [3h]-ota uptake in s2
 xxxg2115xxx  (pah, probenecid,  xxxd2969xxx , octanoate, citrinin,  xxxd2871xxx , cimetidine and indomethacin: n54, p,0.01 vs. control). the inhibitory effects of pah on [3h]-ota uptake in
s2  xxxg2113xxx  were significantly higher than those in s2  xxxg2115xxx  (n54, p,0.01), whereas that of
citrinin on [3h]-ota uptake in s2  xxxg2115xxx  was significantly higher than that in s2  xxxg2113xxx 
(n54, p,0.01). these results suggest that each substrate used might have a different affinity
to compete with ota transport mediated by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx .

lyzed. the uptake of [3h]-ota at different concentrations by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  was determined in the absence or presence of inhibitors. typical results are shown in fig. 5. the
lineweaver-burke plot analysis of pah inhibition on  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota uptake (figs. 5a and 5b, respectively) demonstrated that this compound inhibited ota uptake by
 xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  in a competitive manner. the km values in the absence and presence of
pah in s2  xxxg2113xxx  were 0.48 60.05 and 1.27 60.06 mm (n53), respectively, whereas those
in s2  xxxg2115xxx  were 0.7160.06 and 1.0760.09 mm (n53), respectively. the vmax values in
the absence and presence of pah in s2  xxxg2113xxx  were 24.461.23 and 22.3 61.90 pmol/mg

found to be competitive (data not shown). the ki value for each inhibitor tested is shown in
the table. on the basis of the calculated ki values, the inhibitory effect of drugs on ota
transport was in the following order: probenecid . octanoate . pah .  xxxd2969xxx  . citrinin

discussion
 xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  were recently cloned and characterized as multispecific oats and
were found to mediate active transport of organic anions from the interstitium to the cells in
the proximal tubule (11). there exist some differences in characteristics between  xxxg2113xxx  and
 xxxg2115xxx , such as substrate specificity, and localization:  xxxg2113xxx  exits on the basolateral membrane of the s2 segment of the proximal tubule (11), whereas  xxxg2115xxx  exists on the basolateral
membrane of the first (s1), s2 and s3 segments of the proximal tubule (unpublished observation). in addition,  xxxg2113xxx , but not  xxxg2115xxx  exhibits transport properties of an exchanger (11).
these characteristics of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  were similar to those of rat oat1 ( xxxg2113xxx ) (17)
and rat  xxxg2115xxx  (19), respectively.
in previous studies (5,7,12,20), the basolateral organic anion transport system in the proximal tubule is largely responsible for the blood-to-lumen translocation of ota. in the current
study, we demonstrated the pharmacological characteristics of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  on ota
uptake with respect to the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules in the human kidney.
the uptake of ota increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner and is saturable, suggesting that the mechanism of ota transport may involve the carrier-mediated pathway on
the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules. this hypothesis is also supported by a previous
report (21), suggesting that ota tran-stimulates and competitively inhibits pah transport in the
basolateral membrane vesicle isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. therefore, we could suggest that this mycotoxin is a preferred substrate for  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  in the human kidney.
recently, it was reported that an  xxxg2163xxx  ( xxxg2163xxx -1), which
is a member of a distinct oat family, mediates the transport of ota (km518.9 mm) in cultured liver cells (22).  xxxg2163xxx -1 is localized at the sinusoidal side of hepatocytes and the apical
membrane of the rat renal proximal tubule (23). therefore, it is believed that  xxxg2163xxx -1 reabsorbs
ota across the luminal membrane. the km value of ota transport via  xxxg2163xxx -1 expressed in
oocytes was 16.6 mm, which is about 40 times higher than that via  xxxg2113xxx  (0.42 mm) and 22
times higher than that via  xxxg2115xxx  (0.75 mm). since the main route of renal ota excretion is
tubular secretion (10), these results lead us to conclude that the primary step for ota accumulation in the human kidney may be mediated by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  distributed on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubules. in addition, the km value of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx 
was two or three times higher than that (1.4 mm) of rabbit renal proximal tubular cells (16).
we previously reported that the km value of  xxxg2113xxx  in oocytes was 2.1 mm (18), which was
estimated to have a lower affinity with ota those that of  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx . comparing the
affinity of other types of oats identified in various animal species,  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  have
a high affinity with ota. therefore,  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  seem to contribute significantly to
the transport of ota.
there are two kinds of  xxxg2113xxx  cdnas were cloned and designated as  xxxg2113xxx -1 and
 xxxg2113xxx -2 (11). the current study was performed using  xxxg2113xxx -1. the mrna of  xxxg2113xxx -2
appears to be differentially spliced mrna of  xxxg2113xxx -1 as a result of an alternative splicing
mechanism (11). in addition,  xxxg2113xxx -1 and  xxxg2113xxx -2 exhibited the same level of pah transport activity (11). based on these, transport of various organic anions including ota, methotrexate, salicylate and antiviral agent was characterized using  xxxg2113xxx -1 (unpublished observation). unfortunately, showing the difference in characteristics of ota transport between

k.y. jung et al. / life sciences 69 (2001) 2123–2135

2133

 xxxg2113xxx -1 and  xxxg2113xxx -2 is beyond the scope of the current study and further studies should be
performed to clarify this by establishing cell line stably expressing  xxxg2113xxx -2.
we have already demonstrated that s2 and s3 are the major targets of ota-induced nephrotoxicity (12). in this report, ota treatment resulted in a significant decrease in atp content
in s2 and s3, but not in s1 of isolated rat proximal tubule. however, it dose not necessarily
means that s1 is not the site of ota-induced nephrotoxicity in vivo. it is possible that s1 is
also the site of ota-induced injury. otherwise, we suggest that  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota transport in s1 segment contributes to ota excretion in the proximal tubule.
it has been reported that several substances such as probenecid,  xxxd2969xxx , octanoate,
aspartame and indomethacin inhibit the transport of ota and prevent ota-induced nephrotoxicity (16,24–26). in the present study, we clarified the inhibitory effects of various substrates for oats on ota transport in s2  xxxg2113xxx  and s2  xxxg2115xxx . each drug inhibited hoat1and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota uptake at different ratios. ota uptake was markedly inhibited by
the presence of probenecid,  xxxd2969xxx , octanoate and indomethacin in s2  xxxg2113xxx  as well as
s2  xxxg2115xxx . in contrast to these, pah markedly suppressed ota uptake in s2  xxxg2113xxx , but not
in s2  xxxg2115xxx . these results lead us to consider that pah may be the preferred substrate for
 xxxg2113xxx  rather than for  xxxg2115xxx .
octanoic acid was shown to inhibit peritubular organic anion transport in single s2 segments (27). the current results also confirmed that octanoate significantly inhibited ota
transport by  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx . the present results suggest that citrinin, which is a nephrotoxic mycotoxin and a structural analogue of ota (28), is the preferred substrate for  xxxg2115xxx 
rather than for  xxxg2113xxx . these results, along with previous reports (29), suggest that  xxxg2115xxx  plays
a predominant role in the development of citrinin nephrotoxicity. in contrast, aspartame (an
artificial sweetener) showed no inhibitory effect on  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota
uptake. this is consistent with the previous study using xenopus oocyte expressing  xxxg2113xxx 
(18). aspartame is considered to prevent nephrotoxicity by reducing the rate of ota reabsorption via peptide transporter(s) in the renal proximal tubule (30, 31).
as shown in table, the ki values of probenecid for  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota
uptake, 4.29 mm and 4.40 mm, respectively. in humans, total steady-state maximum plasma
concentration of probenecid was reported to be 170mm (32) and its protein binding rate was
89 % (33). thus, unbound steady-state maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of probenecid
is estimated to be approximately 18.7 mm. since ki values are thought to be comparable to
therapeutically relevant unbound plasma concentration (within fivefold of unbound cmax)
(34), we suggest that probenecid significantly inhibited  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota
uptake into the proximal tubule and could be a useful therapeutic agent for ota-induced
nephrotoxicity in humans. in contrast,  xxxd2969xxx  appears not to exert any clinical significance, whereas this agent was shown to prevent ota-induced nephrotoxicity in rats (24).
the total cmax of  xxxd2969xxx  was reported to be 24.0 mm and its protein binding rate was 99.8 %
(interview form, pfizer co., ltd.). thus, the unbound cmax of  xxxd2969xxx  is estimated to be approximately 0.0048 mm. therapeutically relevant plasma concentration of  xxxd2969xxx  is
much lower than the ki values of this drug for  xxxg2113xxx - and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated ota transport,
19.8 mm and 4.88mm, respectively, as shown in table.
in conclusion, our data show that  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  have a high affinity with ota, and
this may be essentially related to the renal transport of ota on the basolateral membrane in

the human kidney. ota uptake via  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  may be differently influenced by the
endogenous and exogenous substrates of oats in vivo. these ota transport may be associated with the development of nephrotoxicity by this mycotoxin along the nephron segments
of the human kidney.
