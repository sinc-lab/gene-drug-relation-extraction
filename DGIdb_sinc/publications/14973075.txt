abstract
regarding the involvement of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)-independent
pathways in celecoxib-mediated antineoplastic effects, the following two
issues remain outstanding: identity of the non-cox-2 targets and relative
contributions of cox-2-dependent versus -independent mechanisms. we
use a close celecoxib analog deficient in cox-2-inhibitory activity, dmc
{4-[5-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-3(trifluoromethyl)- xxxd3045xxx ]benzenesulfonamide}, to examine the premise that akt signaling represents a
major non-cox-2 target. celecoxib and dmc block akt activation in
pc-3 cells through the inhibition of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1
(pdk-1) with ic50 of 48 and 38 ␮m, respectively. the consequent effect on
akt activation is more pronounced (ic50 values of 28 and 20 ␮m, respectively), which might be attributed to the concomitant dephosphorylation
by protein phosphatase 2a. in serum-supplemented medium, celecoxib
and dmc cause g1 arrest, and at higher concentrations, they induce
apoptosis with relative potency comparable with that in blocking akt
activation. moreover, the effect of daily oral celecoxib and dmc at 100
and 200 mg/kg on established pc-3 xenograft tumors is assessed. celecoxib at both doses and dmc at 100 mg/kg had marginal impacts.
however, a correlation exists between the in vitro potency of dmc and its
ability at 200 mg/kg to inhibit xenograft tumor growth through the
inhibition of akt activation. analysis of the tumor samples indicates that
a differential reduction in the phospho-akt/akt ratio was noted in celecoxib- and dmc-treated groups vis-à-vis the control group. together,
these data underscore the role of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
kinase-1/akt signaling in celecoxib-mediated in vitro antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer cells.

introduction
in the past decade, substantial evidence from epidemiological and
animal model studies has suggested the clinical use of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs in chemoprevention, especially against colon
cancer (1–3). this premise is strengthened by two recent large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, demonstrating that aspirin
might be effective in primary and secondary prevention of colorectal
cancer by lowering the incidence of adenomas (4, 5). the fact that all
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in clinical use are cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitors provides a putative link between the inhibition
of cox activity and the antitumor effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. two isoforms of cox have been characterized, each of
which displays a distinct physiological profile. cox-1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all tissues, of which the inhibition underlies
the gastrointestinal toxicities of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. in contrast, cox-2, an inducible isozyme, is dramatically up-regulated during pathological conditions such as inflammation and cancer (6). increased expression of cox-2 has been
demonstrated in various human malignancies (7–12). furthermore,

evidence suggests that cox-2 overexpression leads to increased
resistance to apoptotic signals and alterations in extracellular matrix
adhesion (13–15). the most compelling evidence for a role of cox-2
in carcinogenesis was obtained by an in vivo study showing that
knockout of the cox-2 gene could suppress tumorigenesis in mice
that had a genetic predisposition to form intestinal polyps (16). consequently, selective inhibition of cox-2 has emerged as a viable
target for cancer prevention and therapy (17, 18). among various
selective cox-2 inhibitors examined, celecoxib has received the most
attention (19), in part, because of its demonstrated effectiveness in
reducing colorectal polyps in patients with familial adenomatous
polyposis (20). in addition to the recent approval by the united states
food and drug administration for the adjuvant treatment of familial
adenomatous polyposis, celecoxib is currently undergoing a series of
clinical trials for its chemopreventive effect on various epithelial
malignancies.
in light of the potential use of celecoxib in the prevention of human
tumors (19, 21), the underlying mechanism has been the focus of
many recent investigations. at the cellular level, celecoxib inhibits
cox-2, causes cell cycle arrest, and induces apoptosis in cancer cells.
however, there exists a disparity by several orders of magnitude
between the concentration needed to inhibit cox-2 (ic50, 0.04 ␮m)
and that for causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro (⬎20 ␮m;
refs. 22 and 23). in addition, evidence from this and other laboratories has demonstrated the involvement of molecular targets other than
cox-2 in celecoxib-mediated in vitro antiproliferative effects in
prostate (23–26) and colon (27) cancer cells. among various putative
pathways reported in the literature, blockade of akt signaling is
especially noteworthy (23–26). together, these data suggest that
celecoxib may use both cox-2 and non-cox-2 targets to mediate its
antitumor activities, although their relative contribution toward the in
vivo effects remains undefined. consequently, a better understanding
of the cox-2-independent pathways may help optimize the chemopreventive potential of celecoxib. in this study, we used celecoxib and
its cox-2-inactive derivative, 4-[5-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-3(trifluoromethyl)- xxxd3045xxx ]benzene-sulfonamide (dmc; ref. 25;
fig. 1a), in pc-3 prostate cancer cells to examine the hypothesis that
the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (pdk-1)/akt signaling pathway represents a major cox-2-independent mechanism by
which celecoxib exerts in vivo antiproliferative effects against prostate
tumors.
materials and methods
reagents. dmc is a close structural analog of celecoxib, of which the
5-aryl moiety is altered by replacing the 4-methylphenyl with a 2,5-dimethylphenyl function (fig. 1a). this slight modification abrogated the activity of
dmc in cox-2 inhibition (ic50 ⬎ 100 ␮m; ref. 28); however, its ability to
block akt phosphorylation and to induce apoptosis in cancer cells was retained
(25). the synthesis of dmc has been described previously (25, 28). celecoxib
was prepared from commercial celebrex capsules by solvent extraction followed by recrystallization. for in vitro studies, these agents at various concentrations were dissolved in dmso and were then added to the cells in 10%
fetal bovine serum (fbs)-containing rpmi 1640. the final dmso concentration was kept at 0.1% after addition to medium. for in vivo studies,

comparative decrease in the s fraction (from 28% to 6%). relatively,
the potency of dmc in causing g1 arrest was higher than that of
celecoxib, which is consistent with that observed in cell proliferation.
together, these data indicate that celecoxib and dmc at concentrations lower than the respective apoptosis thresholds mediated the
antiproliferative effect through the inhibition of cell cycle progression.
celecoxib and dmc block akt signaling by inhibiting pdk-1
kinase activity. previously, we demonstrated that the proapoptotic
activity of celecoxib in pc-3 cells in serum-free media was, in part,
because of the inhibition of akt activation (24). to provide a link
between akt and g1 arrest, we examined the kinase activity of
immunoprecipitated akt from pc-3 cells treated with various levels of
individual agents in 10% fbs-supplemented medium (fig. 2a). the
akt kinase activity in drug-treated cells was attenuated in a dosedependent manner with ic50 values of 28 and 20 ␮m for celecoxib and
dmc, respectively, which were correlative with the respective concentrations required for suppressing 50% pc-3 cell proliferation.
it is noteworthy that neither compound exhibited any direct-inhibitory effect on immunoprecipitated akt kinase activity (data not
shown). in cells, akt activity is regulated through a dynamic balance
between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by pdk-1 and protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a), respectively. previously, we showed that
the dephosphorylation of akt could not be rescued by okadaic acid, a
pp2a inhibitor (24). in light of the report by arico et al. (31) that
celecoxib inhibited pdk-1, an upstream kinase of akt, with high
potency (ic50, 3.5 ␮m), we examined the effect of each agent on the
kinase activity of recombinant pdk-1 using a commercial assay kit
(fig. 2b). this assay is based on the ability of recombinant pdk-1, in
the presence of either agent, to activate its downstream kinase, sgk,

which in turn phosphorylates the peptide substrate rpraatf with
[␥-32p]atp. our data show that celecoxib and dmc displayed
moderate-inhibitory activities against pdk-1 with ic50 values of 48
and 38 ␮m, respectively. to exclude the possibility that celecoxib and
dmc might interfere with the pdk-1 assay by inhibiting sgk activity, we preincubated recombinant pdk-1 with inactive sgk for 2 h to
ensure full sgk activation before adding the inhibitor. under such
conditions, neither celecoxib nor dmc exhibited an inhibitory effect
on the peptide phosphorylation (data not shown), indicating that these
agents were not sgk inhibitors.
it is especially noteworthy that the estimated ic50 of 48 ␮m for
celecoxib could not reconcile with that of 3.5 ␮m reported previously
by arico et al. (31). the cause for this discrepancy, however, remains
unclear.
in addition, the ic50 values of both agents for akt inhibition in
drug-treated cells was substantially lower than those for recombinant
pdk-1. we hypothesized that this discrepancy might, in part, arise
from the concomitant deactivation of akt by pp2a. presumably,
partial inhibition of pdk-1 in concert with the concurrent action by an
uninhibited pp2a could culminate in a greater extent of inhibition of
the akt kinase activity in drug-treated cells.
target validation. two experiments were carried out to validate
pdk-1/akt signaling as a major target responsible for the in vitro
antiproliferative effect of celecoxib and dmc. in addition to akt,
pdk-1 can also phosphorylate other members of the agc protein
kinase family such as p70s6k (32, 37–39). we thus examined the
activity of immunoprecipitated p70s6k in drug-treated pc-3 cells. as
indicated in fig. 2c, the activity of immunoprecipitated p70s6k was
significantly reduced in pc-3 cells exposed to celecoxib and dmc at
the indicated concentrations for 2 h. in addition, we assessed the
protective effect of the transient expression of the constitutively active
forms of pdk-1 and akt (pdk-1a280v, ref. 40; aktt308d/s473d, ref.
41; respectively) on drug-induced pc-3 cell death. western blot
analysis confirmed that transient transfection of pdk-1a280v and
aktt308d/s473d into pc-3 cells led to a several-fold increase in the
expression of the respective kinases (fig. 3a). these transient transfectants were exposed to 10 –50 ␮m celecoxib or dmc for 24 h in
serum-free medium to examine their susceptibility to drug-induced
cell death vis-à-vis transfectants with an empty pcmv vector. as
shown, aktt308d/s473d gave partial yet significant protection against
either agent before complete apoptotic death took place at higher
concentrations (fig. 3b; celecoxib, left; dmc, right). in contrast,
pdk-1a280v provided only a marginal protection, suggesting that
even constitutively active pdk-1 could not overcome the direct
inhibition by these agents. at high concentrations of celecoxib or
dmc, cells underwent rapid apoptotic death. fig. 3c indicates the
partial protective effect of aktt308d/s473d against 40 ␮m dmc before
complete apoptotic death occurred at 6-h posttreatment.
in vivo effect of celecoxib and dmc on pc-3 xenograft
tumor growth. oral celecoxib and dmc at two different doses, 100
and 200 mg/kg, were administered daily to nude mice bearing established pc-3 xenograft tumors. all animals tolerated the treatments
well without observable sign of toxicity and were characterized by
stable body weights throughout the course of study. no gross pathological abnormalities were noted at necropsy after 35 days of treatment.
the effects of individual treatments on tumor growth were assessed
(fig. 4). in addition, serum concentrations of celecoxib and dmc
were measured at different time points during the 24-h period after the
final administration of test agents (fig. 5a). accordingly, the respective pharmacokinetic parameters in pc-3 tumor-bearing mice are
summarized in fig. 5b.

noted in celecoxib- and dmc-treated groups vis-à-vis the control
group (fig. 6b).
in line with the in vivo data on tumor growth, celecoxib displayed
a marginal effect (p ⫽ 0.112) on p-akt/akt ratios, whereas dmc
could significantly suppress in vivo akt phosphorylation at p ⫽ 0.056.
however, there existed no direct correlation between the tumor volume and p-akt status within the same group. characteristic of rapidly
growing and poorly differentiated tumors, these pc-3 xenografts were
heterogeneous with respect to the distribution of viable and necrotic
regions within the tumors. this heterogeneity in the quality of tumor
tissues sampled could account for the lack of correlation.

day dmc displayed a significant effect on the pc-3 tumor growth
(p ⬍ 0.1). although treatment with celecoxib at 200 mg/kg/day and
dmc at 100 mg/kg/day could marginally suppress the proliferation of
the xenograft, these effects were not statistically significant. pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the peak serum concentrations
achieved during the 24-h dosing interval were approximately 20 and
14 ␮m for celecoxib and dmc, respectively, at 200 mg/kg/day. the
respective average serum concentrations (caverage), defined as area
under the curve/time interval, were calculated to be 11.3 and 5.4 ␮m.
high-performance liquid chromatography data suggest that dmc
underwent oxidative metabolism to a greater extent than celecoxib in
mice (not shown). consequently, the serum concentrations of dmc
were significantly lower than those of celecoxib. the major oxidative
metabolite extracted from serum was identified by high-resolution
mass spectrometry to be the dicarboxylate counterpart of dmc (fig.
5c). this metabolic profile is analogous to that of celecoxib. however, it remains unclear whether this oxidative metabolite retained any
antiproliferative activity.
to correlate biological response with the mechanism of action
identified in vitro, the effect of orally administered celecoxib and
dmc at 200 mg/kg/day on p-akt in pc-3 tumors was examined by
immunoblotting. fig. 6a depicts western blots of akt and p-akt in
the homogenates of three representative pc-3 tumors with different
volumes from tumor-bearing mice treated with vehicle, celecoxib, or
dmc for 35 days. these immunoblots were scanned and quantitated
to determine the ratios of the levels of p-akt to akt (in arbitrary
units). overall, a differential reduction in the p-akt/akt ratio was

this study used dmc, a close structural analog of celecoxib, to
discern the relative involvement of cox-2-dependent versus independent pathways in the antiproliferative effect of celecoxib in prostate cancer. even deficient in cox-2-inhibitory activity, dmc was
able to inhibit pc-3 cell proliferation in a manner qualitatively similar
to celecoxib, suggesting that cox-2 inhibition alone could not account for the in vitro antiproliferative effect of celecoxib. in drugtreated cells, akt activity was attenuated as a result of the partial
inhibition of pdk-1 in concert with the concomitant akt dephosphorylation by pp2a. it is well documented that pdk-1/akt signaling
plays a central role in regulating cancer cell survival and proliferation
by affecting the phosphorylation status of a plethora of downstream
effectors that are either pdk-1 or akt substrates (42– 45). consequently, blockade of this signaling cascade leads to growth inhibition
by cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in malignant cells. in 10%
fbs-supplemented medium, both compounds caused g1 arrest and, at

nearly 20 ␮m, neither dose led to significant inhibition of tumor
growth in nude mice. this finding is in line with the in vitro data that
celecoxib at 20 ␮m could not effectively suppress pc-3 cell growth. it
may also dampen the possibility that inhibition of cox-2 in either the
tumor or the host tissues plays a major role in the in vivo antitumor
effect of celecoxib in this model of prostate cancer. in contrast,
treatment with 200 mg/kg/day dmc, which gave rise to a cmax of 14
␮m, showed significant inhibition of the pc-3 tumor growth, which
parallels the results in cultured pc-3 cells in which significant growth
inhibition was seen at a concentration around 15 ␮m. accordingly,
there exists a correlation between the effectiveness of dmc in inhibiting in vitro pc-3 cell proliferation and its ability to inhibit in vivo
pc-3 tumor growth through the inhibition of pdk-1/akt signaling.
these data suggest that pdk-1/akt signaling represents a major
non-cox-2 target underlying the in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative
effects of celecoxib and dmc in prostate cancer cells. it has been
demonstrated that there was no consistent overexpression of cox-2
in established prostate cancer or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia, vis-à-vis adjacent normal prostate tissue (47). this finding
suggests that cox-2 might not play as critical a role in prostatic
carcinogenesis as in other types of cancer.
nevertheless, this cox-2-independent mode of action might be a
cancer type-specific phenomenon. several studies in the literature
have elegantly demonstrated the importance of the inhibition of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx -derived prostaglandins, particularly  xxxd1903xxx , as a major
mechanism underlying the in vivo antitumor action of celecoxib in
different xenograft tumors, including those of hca-7 colon cancer
cells (22) and hnscc 1483 head and neck cancer cells (48). presumably, in these xenograft models, stromal or host-derived cox-2dependent processes may play a prominent role in tumorigenesis
and/or angiogenesis (49 –51), rendering these tumors more susceptible
to the cox-2-inhibitory effect of celecoxib. consequently, growth of

higher concentrations, induced apoptosis with relative potency consistent with the respective activities in blocking akt activation. in
addition, we reported that celecoxib and dmc facilitated the dephosphorylation of  xxxg1366xxx  (23, 25). however, our data suggest that  xxxg1366xxx 
down-regulation might not be as important as pdk-1 inhibition in
celecoxib-induced cell death, because treatment of pc-3 cells with the
inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase,  xxxd1169xxx , did
not lead to apoptotic death.1 moreover, at concentrations as low as 10
␮m, celecoxib was able to perturb intracellular calcium by inhibiting
endoplasmic reticulum ca2⫹-atpases (46). together, these data underscore the pharmacological complexity in cox-2-independent signaling mechanisms that celecoxib uses to mediate antiproliferative
effects in vitro.

major cox-2-independent target for celecoxib

these xenografts could be attenuated by low serum concentrations of
celecoxib via a cox-2-dependent mechanism.
in summary, the impetus of the present study is at least 3-fold. first,
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using a celecoxib
analog to discern the relative contribution of cox-2-dependent versus
cox-2-independent signaling mechanisms in the in vivo antitumor
effects of celecoxib. second, our present data demonstrate that  xxxg1718xxx /akt signaling represents a unique non-cox-2 target for celecoxib,
whereas rofecoxib (vioxx) and other cox-2 inhibitors have no
appreciable-inhibitory effect on pdk-1 (data not shown). this discrepancy explains why celecoxib is substantially more potent than
other cox-2 inhibitors in inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
cancer cells. third, separation of the effect on pdk-1/akt signaling
from the cox-2-inhibitory activity allows us to use celecoxib as a
starting point to design a novel class of antitumor agents, of which the
proof of principle has been demonstrated in our previous paper (26).
use of this strategy to develop more potent pdk-1/akt signaling
inhibitors is currently underway in this laboratory.
