summary
the use of b-blockers has emerged as a beneﬁcial treatment for cardiac hypertrophy. hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a ( xxxg1048xxx ) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. however, the expression of  xxxg1048xxx 
in cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload and after treatment with b-blocker is little known. to
evaluate the eﬀect of carvedilol on both myocardial  xxxg1048xxx  expression and cardiac hypertrophy, infrarenal aortic banding was performed for 4 weeks in adult sprague-dawley rats to induce cardiac hypertrophy. carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. heart weight and the ratio of
heart weight and body weight increased signiﬁcantly after aortic banding for 4 weeks in the absence of drug
treatment. mean arterial pressure increased from 80 ± 9 mmhg in the sham group to 94 ±5 mmhg
(p < 0.001) in the banding group. echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy after aortic banding.
mean arterial pressure decreased after treatment with carvedilol. the increased wall thickness and heart
weight was reversed to normal by carvedilol. western blot showed that  xxxg1048xxx , vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) and brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) proteins were up-regulated and nerve growth
factor-b (ngf-b) down-regulated in the banding group. treatment with  xxxd3487xxx , doxazosin, or
 xxxd68xxx  did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf proteins expression in the banding groups.
real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mrna of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf and bnp increased and
mrna of ngf-b decreased in the banding group. treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and
mrna of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf, bnp, and ngf-b to the baseline values. increased immunohistochemical
labeling of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf, and bnp in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the banding group
and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. in conclusion,  xxxg1048xxx , vegf, and bnp mrna and protein
expression were up-regulated, while ngf-b mrna and protein was downregulated in the rat model of
pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy. treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of
abnormal regulation of  xxxg1048xxx ,vegf, bnp, and ngf-b in the hypertrophic myocardium.

bidity and mortality. chronic cardiac hypertrophy
may be deleterious because it increases the risk for
the development of heart failure and premature
death [1]. cardiac hypertrophy is usually accompanied by complex changes in gene reprogramming [2]. these changes include genes that modify

410
energy metabolism and encode components of
hormonal pathways.
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (hif-1), a transcription factor, is now recognized to be a key
physiologic regulator of gene expression that
responds to changes in cellular oxygen tension [3].
hif-1 is a heterodimeric dna complex composed
of  xxxg1048xxx  and hif-1b.under hypoxic conditions,
both  xxxg1048xxx  protein levels and activity of the  xxxg1048xxx  transactivation domains increases [4, 5].  xxxg1048xxx 
is involved in energy metabolism. in the progression of heart failure, in which impaired energy
metabolism may occur,  xxxg1048xxx  is likely to be
involved in the activation of the glycolytic system
[6, 7]. in addition to the hypoxic pathway mediating  xxxg1048xxx  expression, other nonhypoxic pathways factors such as neurohormonal activators and
mechanical stress have also been shown to induce
 xxxg1048xxx  expression in vascular smooth muscle cells
[8, 9]. recently kim et al. [10] demonstrated that
acute hemodynamic overload induced early expression of  xxxg1048xxx  and vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf) in rat myocardium.
the expression of  xxxg1048xxx  in cardiac hypertrophy is little known. tissue ischemia has been
reported in congestive heart failure [11], possibly
due to a combination of increased wall stress and
coronary vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction. increased wall stress occurs in hypertrophic myocardium.  xxxg1048xxx  may play a role in
the hypertrophic myocardium because of pressure overload. the use of b-blockers has emerged
as a beneﬁcial treatment in hypertensive patients
with increased left ventricular mass [12]. however, the link of gene expression to b-blocker
treatment in the hypertrophic heart is rarely
reported. accordingly, we sought to evaluate the
eﬀect of carvedilol on both myocardial  xxxg1048xxx 
expression and cardiac hypertrophy in a rat
model of pressure overload induced by abdominal aortic constriction.

randomly divided into four groups: (1) shamoperated, (2) sham-operated and treatment with
carvedilol, (3) pressure-overloaded (aortic banding), and (4) pressured-overloaded and treatment
with carvedilol rats. a polyethylene catheter
(pe10) was put on the surface of abdominal aorta
distal to the renal arteries. then the catheter and
aorta were tightly constricted with 6-0 silk. shamoperated control animals were prepared in a
similar manner, except that the aorta was not
constricted. after the procedure, the catheter was
fully withdrawn and the abdominal wound was
sutured and let the rats recover. in the treatment
group, the rat was given 50 mg/kg body weight per
day of carvedilol in drinking water after surgery
for 4 weeks. the perioperative mortality in the
aortic banding group was around 10%. in addition
to carvedilol,  xxxd3487xxx  (a selective angiotenisn ii
receptor antagonist) at 30 mg/kg body weight per
day, doxazosin (a-adrenergic receptor antagonist)
at 3 mg/kg body weight per day, and  xxxd68xxx  (antioxidant) at 250 mg/kg body weight per
day were also given to diﬀerent banding rats. all
animal procedures were performed in accordance
with institutional guideline and conformed with
the guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals as published by the us nih.
hemodynamic monitor
four weeks after the surgery, the animals were
anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/
kg), and their carotid arteries were cannulated
with polyethylene catheters to measure mean
arterial pressure. heart rate was measured
through a grass model tachograph preampliﬁer.
after the measurement of hemodynamic data, the
rats were sacriﬁced to remove the heart to
perform the following experiments. each hemodyamic data was presented as a mean from three
measurements.
assessment of cardiac hypertrophy and function

methods
rat model of abdominal aortic constriction
on the day of surgery, adult sprague-dawley rats
weighing 250–300 g were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg) and the aorta was
exposed via abdominal midline incision. rats were

cardiac function of aortic banding rats was
evaluated noninvasively by echocardiography performed with an acuson sequoia 512 machine
using a 15-mhz probe at the day of sacriﬁce,
4 weeks after surgery. left ventricular percent
fractional shortening, left ventricular end-diastolic
dimension, left ventricular end-systolic dimension,

411
interventricular septum thickness, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were calculated.
the sonographer was blinded to the randomization
of rats. the following experiments were performed
by a technician blinded to the design of the study.
western blot analysis
tissue samples from left ventricle were homogenized in modiﬁed ripa buﬀer (50 mmol/l tris
[ph 7.4], 1% igepal ca-630 (sigma), 0.25%
sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 150 mmol/l nacl, 1 mmol/
l edta, 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride,
and 1 lg/ml aprotinin, leupetin, and pepstatin).
nuclear and cytosolic protein samples were mixed
with sample buﬀer, boiled for 10 min, separated
by sds-page under denaturing conditions, and
electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. the
nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation in blocking buﬀer, incubated with  xxxd328xxx , or anti- xxxg1048xxx , anti-bnp, or anti-ngf-b
antibody, washed, and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. signals
were visualized by chemiluminenescent detection.
rna isolation and reverse transcription
total rna was isolated from frozen left
ventricle using the single-step acid guanidinium
thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method. total rna (1 lg) was incubated with 200 u
of moloney–murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase in a buﬀer containing a ﬁnal concentration of 50 mmol/l tris–cl (ph 8.3),
75 mmol/l kcl, 3 mmol/mgcl2, 20 u of rnase
inhibitor, 1 lmol/l polydt oligomer, and
0.5 mmol/l of each dntp in a ﬁnal volume of
20 ll. the reaction mixture was incubated at 42 c
for 1 h and then at 94 c for 5 min to inactivate
the enzyme. a total of 80 ll of diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water was added to the reaction
mixture before storage at )70 c.
real-time pcr
a lightcycler (roche diagnostics, mannheim,
germany) was used for real-time pcr. cdna
was diluted 1 in 10 with nuclease-free water. 2 ll
of the solution was used for the lightcycler

sybr-green mastermix (roche diagnostics):
0.5 lmol/l primer, 5 mmol/l  xxxd2532xxx ,
and 2 ll master sybr-green in nuclease-free
water in a ﬁnal volume of 20 ll. the primers used
for vegf,  xxxg1048xxx , ngf-b, bnp, and  xxxg861xxx 
were: forward, 5¢-cacccacgacagaagg-3¢,
5¢-ag tcggacagcctcac-3¢, 5¢-aaccaatagct gcccg-3¢, 5¢-ctcaaaggaccaaggc3¢, and 5¢-catcaccatcttccaggagc-3¢,

ctgcc-3¢, respectively. the initial denaturation
phase for rat vegf was 5 min at 95 c followed
by an ampliﬁcation phase as detailed below:
denaturation at 95 c for 10 s; annealing at
55 c for 10 s; elongation at 72 c for 15 s;
detection at 79 c and for 37 cycles. the ampliﬁcation phase program of rat  xxxg1048xxx  as detailed
below: denaturation at 95 c for 10 s; annealing at
57 c for 10 s; elongation at 72 c for 15 s;
detection at 80 c and for 36 cycles. the amplication phase for rat bnp was denaturation at
95 c for 5 s; annealing at 60 c for 3 s; elongation at 72 c for 5 s; detection at 72 c and for 40
cycles. the amplication phase for rat ngf-b was
denaturation at 95 c for 10 s; annealing at 56 c
for 5 s; elongation at 72 c for 20 s; detection at
72 c and for 39 cycles. ampliﬁcation, ﬂuorescence detection, and post-processing calculation
were performed using the lightcycler apparatus.
individual pcr product was analyzed for dna
sequence to conﬁrm the purity of the product. the
size of the pcr products for vegf,  xxxg1048xxx ,
ngf-b, bnp, and  xxxg861xxx  were 421, 436, 474,
294, and 405 bp, respectively.
immunohistochemistry
slides were dried overnight at room temperature.
snap-frozen sections were postﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, treated in 3% hydrogen
peroxide/pbs for 25 min, blocked in 5% normal
rabbit serum for 20 min, blocked with biotin/
avidin for 15 min each, and incubated with the
following: primary antibody ( xxxd328xxx , antihif-1a, anti-bnp, or anti-ngf-b antibody) for
2 h at room temperature, biotinylated rabbit-anti
mouse igg at 1:400 for 30 min, and vector elite
abc biotin-avidin-peroxidase complex for 30 min;

412
sections were then developed with diaminobenzidine and diaminobenzidine enhancer (vector),
counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted.
statistical analysis
all results were expressed as mean ± sd. statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated using analysis of
variance followed by tukey-kramer multiple
comparisons test (graphpad software inc., dan
diego, ca). a value of p < 0.05 was considered
to denote statistical signiﬁcance.
results
hemodynamic and echocardiographic change after
banding and treatment with carvedilol
the mean of baseline body weight was 270 gm. the
mean of baseline thickness of interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall was 1.1 mm
and 1.3 mm, respectively. the baseline body weight
and echocardiographic parameters were similar in
each group (n = 36 for all groups). as shown in
table 1, heart rate increased signiﬁcantly after
aortic banding for 4 weeks from 329 ± 8 bpm in
the sham group to 352 ± 10 bpm (p < 0.001) in
the banding group. mean arterial pressure increased
from 80 ± 9 mmhg in the sham group to
94 ± 5 mmhg (p < 0.001) in the banding group.
echocardiography showed that the thickness of
interventricular septum and left ventricular poster-

ior wall also increased signiﬁcantly after aortic
banding. treatment with carvedilol signiﬁcantly
reduced the heart weight and the ratio of heart
weight and body weight. mean arterial pressure also
decreased after treatment with carvedilol. the
increased wall thickness was reversed to normal by
carvedilol. treatment with carvedilol in the banding
and sham groups signiﬁcantly decreased heart rate
as compared with both groups without treatment.
a dose-dependent eﬀect of carvedilol on wall
thickness was observed. as shown in table 2, lower
dose of carvedilol at 2.5 mg/kg/day showed less
eﬀect on reversed wall thickness and reduction in
mean arterial blood pressure than higher dose of
carvedilol at 12.5 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day.
treatment with propranolol at 30 mg/kg/day
showed similar eﬀect on hemodyanmic and echocardiographic change as compared to treatment
with carvedilol at 12.5 mg/kg/day (data not shown).
as shown in table 3, treatment with  xxxd3487xxx  and
doxazosin also decreased heart weight, mean arterial pressure, and thickness of interventricular
septum after banding.  xxxd68xxx  did not
aﬀect the heart weight, mean arterial pressure, and
echocardiographic parameters after banding.
western blot analysis after aortic banding and
treatment with carvedilol
to evaluate the eﬀect of aortic banding and
cavedilol on the  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf protein
expression, western blotting was performed. the

2.4-fold at 4 weeks of induction of aortic banding
as compared to sham group (figure 1). treatment
with carvedilol in the banding group signiﬁcantly
blocked the increase of  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf proteins-induced by aortic banding. aortic banding
signiﬁcantly increased bnp protein expression
(2.7-fold, p < 0.001 vs. sham group) and decreased ngf-b protein expression (0.8-fold,
p < 0.05 vs. sham group). treatment with carvedilol in the banding group reversed the bnp and

decreased ngf-b mrna expression (0.7-fold,
p < 0.05 vs. sham group). treatment with carvedilol in the banding group completely blocked

the increase of bnp and ngf-b mrna expression-induced by aortic banding. treatment with

immunohistochemical stain conﬁrmed the previous ﬁndings from western blots and real-time
pcr. increased labeling of  xxxg1048xxx , vegf and

bnp in the ventricular myocardium was observed
after induction of aortic banding for 4 weeks
(figure 6). treatment with carvedilol in the banding group decreased the immunohistochemical

in this study, we demonstrated that both  xxxg1048xxx 
and vegf mrna and protein expression were
up-regulated in a rat model of pressure overloadinduced cardiac hypertrophy. the model of cardiac hypertrophy was conﬁrmed by morphological
and gene proﬁle study. blood pressure and heart
weight increased after aortic banding. cardiac
echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy

of left ventricle after aortic banding for 4 weeks.
the hemodynamic and echocardiographic data
that are presented certainly support a pressure
overload state. cardiac bnp mrna and protein
expression were measured to conﬁrm the presence
of cardiac hypertrophy. expression of bnp gene is
one of the most reliable markers for activation of
the hypertrophic program in clinical states and
experimental models associated with hypertrophy
[13]. the elevated bnp supports the presence of
cardiac hypertrophy.
although expressions of other genes such as
natriuretic peptide have been extensively examined
in cardiac hypertrophy, much less is known about
 xxxg1048xxx  [13, 14]. aortic banding is known to
increase concentrations of several humoral factors
including  xxxg99xxx , epinephrine,  xxxg674xxx 
as well as blood pressure [15, 16]. the presence of
circulating humoral factors secondary to pressure
overload that can trigger the cardiac hypertrophic
response and alter gene expression. reactive oxygen species also play a key role in pressure
overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and antioxidant attenuates myocardial hypertrophy

[17, 18]. recent studies suggest that  xxxg1048xxx 
mrna and protein can be induced under normoxic conditions by growth factors and hormones in
vascular smooth muscle cells [8, 9] and by
mechanical stress in rat myocardium [10].
although increased wall stress and myocardial
stretching might be responsible, humoral factors
secondary to mechanical load could also contribute to the upregulation of  xxxg1048xxx  mrna and
protein expression in the model of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. in the model of
pressure overload, the blood pressure and left
ventricular mass were increased and cytokine
released due to neurohormonal activation.
accordingly,  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf were up-regulated in the pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy. carvedilol treatment decreased blood
pressure and left ventricular mass and may also
decrease neurohormal activation. therefore, carvedilol treatment reverses the abnormal expression
of  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf in the hypertrophic myocardium.
the vegf expression in hypertrophic
myocardium is also little known. the vegf

expression in heart failure is controversial. tham
et al. reported up-regulation of  xxxg2413xxx  without
angiogenesis in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by mitochondrial dysfunction
[19]. however, abraham et al. demonstrated that
 xxxg2413xxx  was down-regulated and capillary
density was decreased in patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy [20]. in patients with congestive
heart failure, the blood levels of vegf were also
inconsistent [21, 22]. decreased ngf-b and
elevated bnp in our study may indicate that
asymptomatic heart failure in our model of
pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy. in this
study, we demonstrated that  xxxg1048xxx  mrna and
protein expression was upregulated in a pressure
overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. the increase in  xxxg1048xxx  protein will increase the expression of its target gene, vegf.
use of b-blocker to treat patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure is beneﬁcial.
the functional recovery resulting from b-blockertherapy has been shown to restore the unfavorable
gene expression that control ca2+ handling in the

failing heart [23, 24]. whether b-blocker therapy
can alter  xxxg1048xxx , a major physiologic regulator of
many genes, in myocardium is not known in
cardiac hypertrophy. change gene expression after
b-blocker therapy in human was obtained from
right ventricle [23, 25]. however gene expression of
the left ventricle is not necessarily the same as in
the right ventricle.
carvedilol is a nonselective, vasodilating
b-blocker with potent antioxidant and free radical-scavenging properties that is used in the
treatment of hypertension, angina, and congestive
heart failure [26]. in the present study, carvedilol
repressed cardiac hypertrophy induced by aortic
banding which is consistent with previous study
reported by massart et al. [16]. in this study, both
 xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist and a-adrenergic receptor antagonist decreased blood pressure induced by aortic banding, but the  xxxg1048xxx 
and vegf proteins did not change signiﬁcantly.
these data implicated that change of  xxxg1048xxx  and
vegf gene expression by carvedilol was not contributed by hemodynamic alteration. antioxidant

419
with  xxxd68xxx  did not alter  xxxg1048xxx  and
vegf proteins, implying the negligible eﬀect of
oxidative stress changes on this phenomenon.
other b-receptor blockades such as propranolol
have similar eﬀect on change of  xxxg1048xxx  and
vegf gene expression induced by aortic banding. the potential mechanism that carvedilol
reverses  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf gene expression in
pressure-overloaded heart is through b-receptorblockade eﬀect. our study proves that there is a
class eﬀect of b-receptor blockade on change of
 xxxg1048xxx  and vegf gene expression induced by
aortic banding.
cardiac hypertrophy can be induced in many
hypertensive animal models. the classic animal
models include stroke prone spontaneously
hypertensive rats fed with a high-salt-diet, uninephrectomized rats receiving deoxycorticosterone acetate and a high-salt diet, renovascular
hypertensive rats, and rats infused with  xxxg99xxx  or norepinephrine. the mechanisms of
cardiac hypertrophy induced by these models
may not be similar to that of our aortic banding
model. it needs further study to investigate
whether the eﬀect of carvedilol applies to these
hypertensive animal models.
reducing heart rate has been reported to
increase myocardial vegf production [25]. in
our study, carvedilol reduced heart rate both in the
treated sham and banding groups. however,
vegf and  xxxg1048xxx  mrna and protein expression
in the treated sham group were similar to that in
the sham group without treatment. this ﬁnding
indicated that the up-regulation of vegf and
 xxxg1048xxx  mrna and protein expression in the
pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy
was not due to bradycardia eﬀect. however, we
cannot exclude the possibility that hemodynamic
change after carvedilol treatment may alter the
 xxxg1048xxx  and vegf expression in our study.
in summary,  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf mrna and
protein expression were up-regulated in the rat
model of cardiac hypertrophy because of pressure
overload. treatment with carvedilol is associated
with a reversal of abnormal regulation of  xxxg1048xxx 
and vegf in the hypertrophic myocardium.
these ﬁndings emphasize the potential implications of carvedilol on pressure-overload induced
cardiac hypertrophy to clinical setting such as
hypertensive patients with increased left ventricular mass.
