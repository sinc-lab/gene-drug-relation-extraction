abstract
revealed uniform and high distribution of radioactivity in the bone
marrow and splenic red pulp with less extensive distribution in the
renal cortex (glomeruli, associated ducts, interstitial cells). radioactivity in the kidney was most prominent in the outer medullary and
papillary interstitium. at 2 weeks after dosing, cumulative radioactivity recovery in the urine and feces was 60 and 7% of the administered dose, respectively, with most of the radioactivity associated
with the parent molecule. in conclusion, the pk characteristics are
consistent with a pegylated peptide of a 45-kda molecular mass,
specifically low volume of distribution and long half-life. drug was
localized principally to hematopoietic sites, and nonspecific tissue
retention was not observed. the nonhuman primate data indicate
that  xxxd2861xxx  is metabolically stable and primarily excreted in
the urine.

introduction

 xxxd2861xxx  is a  xxxd2982xxx  (peg)ylated, peptide-based
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (esa) that is approved in the united
states for the treatment of anemia due to ckd in adult patients on
dialysis.  xxxd2861xxx  stimulates the epor, but has no sequence
homology to rhuepo (woodburn et al., 2011).  xxxd2861xxx , by virtue
of its lack of immunologic crossreactivity (fan et al., 2006), has been
shown to correct anemia in rats with anti-epo antibody-mediated pure
red cell aplasia (woodburn et al., 2007) as well as increase hemoglobin levels and reduce the need for transfusions in ckd patients
with pure red cell aplasia caused by anti-epo antibodies (macdougall
et al., 2009).
the  xxxd2861xxx  peptide sequence was identified by peptide
screening against the human epor, followed by synthetic chemical
optimization (fan et al., 2006). the screening methodology allows
the generation of peptide alternatives to endogenous proteins with
amino acid sequences unrelated to the natural ligand or any other
human sequence (cwirla et al., 1997). the  xxxd2861xxx  peptide was
pegylated in an effort to prolong systemic circulation, increase
solubility, and decrease the peptide’s immunogenic potential by
masking epitopes (caliceti and veronese, 2003; harris and chess
2003).

erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone synthesized by the kidney in
response to hypoxia. the hormone activates the erythropoietin (epo)
receptor (epor) on bone marrow erythroid-cell precursors supporting
their proliferation, growth, and differentiation, which leads to reticulocytosis and subsequent red blood cell maturation. anemia in chronic
kidney disease (ckd) patients occurs as a result of damage to the
renal cells that are responsible for epo production (maxwell et al.,
1997). benefits of anemia treatment in ckd patients include decreased
morbidity, hospitalization, mortality, and transfusion avoidance (vanrenterghem et al., 2002; silverberg, 2003; li et al., 2004). currently in
the united states, management of anemia secondary to ckd relies on
recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuepo,  xxxd2011xxx , procrit,
epogen) or  xxxd1812xxx  (aranesp), which are typically administered up to three times weekly or every 1–2 weeks, respectively.

 xxxd2861xxx , a  xxxd2982xxx  (peg)ylated peptide-based
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, stimulates the  xxxg718xxx  dimer that governs erythropoiesis. studies were designed to
determine the erythropoietic response, pharmacokinetics (pk),
tissue distribution, metabolism, and excretion of  xxxd2861xxx  in
nonhuman primates following a single i.v. dose. the pk profile of
 xxxd2861xxx  (0.1–5 mg/kg) is characterized by low, dose-dependent
plasma clearance; small volume of distribution; and long half-life.
the  xxxd2861xxx  pk profile following a single i.v. dose is consistent with the sustained erythropoiesis. biodistribution quantitative whole-body autoradiography demonstrated high  xxxd2861xxx 
levels in bone marrow (i.e., primary hematopoietic site) as well as
other known hematopoietic sites persisting through at least 3 weeks
at 2.1 mg/kg. microautoradiography analysis at 48 hours postdose

materials and methods
chemicals
 xxxd2861xxx  is a synthetic, dimeric peptide (approximate molecular mass
4,900 da). the molecule is comprised of two identical 21-amino acid chains
covalently bonded via a linker to a single lysine-branched bis-peg chain
(approximate molecular mass 40,000 da), yielding a total molecular mass of
approximately 45,000 da (fig. 1). the linker is derived from iminodiacetic and
b-alanine.
both unlabeled and radiolabeled  xxxd2861xxx  were used in the studies.
radiolabeled  xxxd2861xxx , with the 14c-radiolabel on the lysine linker between
the peptide dimer and the two 20-kda peg chains (fig. 1) was used for the
quantitative whole-body autoradiography (qwba) biodistribution and for the
excretion/metabolism studies. radiolabeled [14c] xxxd2861xxx , with activity
ranging from 5.5 to 5.7 mci/mg and a radiochemical purity of approximately
90%, was synthesized by ge healthcare (buckinghamshire, uk). the process
to prepare the labeled material used a synthetic route that resulted in a monopegylated 14c-labeled species at a level of approximately 10%, in addition to
radiolabeled parent compound. the mono-peg is a specific impurity formed
during radiolabel chemical synthesis and has not been identified in any
unlabeled lots. the mono-peg species results from incomplete pegylation
(i.e., attachment of only one of the two 20-kda peg chains) and likely
represents pegylation of either the alpha or epsilon amine of lysine. the level
of mono-peg present in the formulation was not deducted from the total
radioactivity measured in plasma and tissues.

animal studies
animals were maintained at each of the study facilities in accordance with
the guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals.
pharmacology
dimeric peptide. male non-naïve cynomolgus monkeys (n = 3 per group; 3
kg; covance, denver, pa) were administered an i.v. injection of dimeric
peptide (i.e.,  xxxd2861xxx  minus pegylation) at 0.1 or 1 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) on
day 1. blood samples for complete blood counts (cbcs), including reticulocyte
counts, were collected prior to dosing and on days 4, 6, 10, 14, 19, and 29
postdose.
 xxxd2861xxx . male non-naïve cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4 per group; 3–5
years old) were administered an i.v. injection of vehicle (10 mmol/l acetic acid
in isotonic saline, ph 5.5) or 0.02, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/kg  xxxd2861xxx  at 0.5 ml/kg
on day 1. blood samples for cbcs, including reticulocyte counts, were
collected prior to and 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63 days following
administration.
the rbc and reticulocyte data following administration of the dimeric
peptide or  xxxd2861xxx  are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation. comparisons of hematologic parameters were performed using a one-way analysis
of variance followed by a post hoc dunnett’s test. a p value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
pharmacokinetics
the pk and linearity of the pk profile were evaluated following single i.v.
doses of  xxxd2861xxx . male non-naïve cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4 per group;
4 years old, 4.2–4.4 kg) were administered single escalating i.v. doses of 0.1,
0.5, and 5 mg/kg  xxxd2861xxx  at 0.5 ml/kg with a 42-day washout period
between doses. the vehicle was isotonic saline. blood samples for pk analysis
were collected from animals predose and at 0.25, 1, 6, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168,
240, 336, 408, and 504 hours postdose. plasma was obtained and analyzed for
 xxxd2861xxx  by a validated competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
in monkey plasma with a lower limit of quantification of 40 ng/ml (fan et al.,
2006; woodburn et al., 2007).
the pk parameters were calculated using winnonlin software (version
5.0.1; pharsight, mountain view, ca). area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (auc) and area under the first-moment curve of the plasma
concentration-time curve (aumc) were calculated by the linear trapezoidal
rule. clearance (cl) was calculated as dose/auc, mean residence time as area
under the first-moment curve of the plasma concentration-time curve/auc, and
volume of distribution at steady state (vss) as cl*mean residence time. the
cmax was designated as the measured value at the earliest sampling time point
of 0.25 hours postdose.
tissue distribution
tissue distribution and localization were investigated using qwba and
microautoradiography (marg). male naïve cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4; 2 years
old, 1.9–2.0 kg) were given an i.v. bolus dose of [14c] xxxd2861xxx  at 2.1 mg/kg
(7.14 mci/mg). three monkeys were sacrificed for qwba analysis 48 hours or 1
or 3 weeks after dosing. one monkey was sacrificed for marg analysis at 48
hours after dosing. blood samples for cbcs, including reticulocyte counts, were
collected predose; 48 and 120 hours postdose; and at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after
dosing. blood samples for pk determination were collected predose; at 1, 24, 48,
72, and 120 hours postdose; and at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after dosing.

studies conducted in the rat characterizing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (adme) of  xxxd2861xxx  after
i.v. administration and correlating the adme properties with the
pharmacological activity have been reported (woodburn et al., 2012).
the toxicologic assessment of  xxxd2861xxx  was also performed in
both the rat (woodburn et al., 2009) and the monkey (woodburn et al.,
2008a,b). the monkey and the rat are appropriate species for the
nonclinical assessment of  xxxd2861xxx  based on pharmacological,
toxicological, and pharmacokinetic (pk) considerations.  xxxd2861xxx 
has been shown to be pharmacologically active in both rats and
monkeys. in addition, the red blood cell (rbc) life span is 52–128
days in the monkey and 45–60 days in the rat (moore, 2000), compared with 120 days in normal adult humans and 45–85 days in
patients with renal failure (kruse et al., 2008). unlike the rat, humans
and monkeys undergo little or no extramedullary hematopoiesis (emh)
in the spleen and liver under normal conditions, whereas rodents
commonly exhibit a fairly robust emh response throughout their lives
(greaves and faccini, 1992). the erythropoietic response in monkeys,
therefore, more closely approximates the response in humans when
compared with the rats, which allows a more direct translation of the
data obtained in monkeys to human clinical use.
extensive nonclinical studies have been conducted in nonhuman
primates to support clinical development and approval of  xxxd2861xxx .
the results of studies designed to determine the erythropoietic response, pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and major routes of elimination of  xxxd2861xxx  following a single i.v. dose in cynomolgus
monkeys are described.

metabolism and excretion
the metabolism and excretion of  xxxd2861xxx  was evaluated in male nonnaïve cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4; 4 years old, 3.6–4.3 kg) following a single
i.v. administration of 5 mg/kg radiolabeled [14c] xxxd2861xxx  (28 mci/kg body
weight). blood samples for the analysis of pk parameters and metabolite
profiling were also obtained at 0.25, 1, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 240,
and 336 hours postdose.
the total plasma concentration of radioactivity was measured by a direct
method (lsc). quantitative metabolite profiling was performed using pooled
plasma samples prepared from combining each respective time point. samples
were extracted and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc) separation and fractionation as subsequently described. radioactivity
concentrations in the various fractions were measured by lsc. unlabeled
standards, including the non-pegylated peptide monomer, non-pegylated
peptide dimer and a mono-peg, were used for identification of potential
metabolites. the unidentified minor peaks were combined as “others.” the pk
parameters were analyzed for  xxxd2861xxx  and metabolites as follows. the
cmax was obtained from the actual values measured at the earliest time point
(i.e., 0.25 hours). the t1/2 and auc were calculated by the winnonlin
noncompartmental model (ver. 4.1; pharsight corporation). clearance was
calculated as dose/auc. the auc of metabolites designated as “others” was
calculated by the subtraction of the auc of the identified components from the
auc of total radioactivity in the plasma.
urine and fecal samples were collected every 24 hours up to 14 days after
dosing. radioactivity in the urine samples was measured using the direct
method. radioactivity in fecal homogenates was measured using the combustion followed by direct lsc methods. cumulative excretion ratio was calculated and expressed as percent of administered dose.
for quantitative metabolite profiling, two aliquots (i.e., 0–168 and 168–336
hours postdose) of each biologic matrix were obtained by combining pooled
samples from the 4 animals at respective 24-hour collection intervals. the
samples were subsequently extracted and analyzed by hplc fractionation and
radioactivity was measured by a direct method (lsc) for plasma and urine and
by a combustion method for the fecal homogenate.

high-performance liquid chromatography for metabolite profiling
the radioactive hplc fraction eluents were identified as  xxxd2861xxx  or
mono-peg ( xxxd2861xxx  with one peg chain), with the remaining radioactivity designated as “other.” the classification of other is considered likely to
encompass smaller pegylated-peptides and peptide/amino acid components.
sample preparation. plasma, urine, and fecal homogenates were extracted
with 5 volumes of methanol containing 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid (tfa). the
homogenate samples were then mixed and centrifuged at 1,500g at 4°c for 10
minutes to obtain supernatant. a portion of the supernatant was counted by
lsc to estimate the extraction ratio of [14c] xxxd2861xxx  and its related
compounds in the biologic samples. extraction efficiencies for plasma and
urine were above 95 and 97%, respectively.
the rest of the supernatant was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen gas
stream. the residue was dissolved in a small volume of mobile phase a and b
[mp(a):mp(b) = 1:1 by volume]. a mixture of 0.1% tfa aqueous solution
and 0.1% tfa in methanol solution were used for mp(a) and mp(b),
respectively. the samples were injected into the hplc, which consisted of an
lc-10advp pump, a cto-10acvp column oven, an spd-10avp uv
detector, and an scl-10avp system controller. the hplc separation was
achieved at 40°c with a zorbax 300sb-c8 column (150 mm  2.1 mm i.d., 5
mm; agilent technologies japan, ltd., kyoto, japan). the flow rate was 0.5
ml/min, and the peaks were monitored by a uv absorption detector at 215 nm
and a radioisotope detector. the gradient elution involved increasing mp(b)
from 50 to 80% and from 80 to 83% over a period of 2–10 minutes and 10–20
minutes, respectively. the concentration of mp(b) was continuously increased
to 90% by 20.1 minutes and was held at 90% for 10 minutes, then cycled back
to the initial condition (50%) yielding a total run time of 40 minutes. under
these conditions unchanged  xxxd2861xxx  and mono-peg eluted at 18 and 17
minutes, respectively.

results
pharmacology. the pharmacological activity of the dimeric peptide is enhanced by pegylation. dimeric peptide doses of 0.1 and
1 mg/kg did not induce increases in rbcs in male cynomolgus
monkeys following a single i.v. administration (not shown). the
lowest  xxxd2861xxx  dose tested of 0.02 mg/kg, which contains approximately 0.0022 mg/kg of the dimeric peptide, on a weight basis,
produced a statistically significant (p , 0.05) increase in rbcs, compared with the concurrent vehicle control (fig. 2).
 xxxd2861xxx  induced an initial, generally dose-dependent increase
in percent reticulocytes. at peak response on day 5, however, a notable difference between the response at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg was not
observed, suggesting that the magnitude of the peak response plateaus
at a given dose. the increase in reticulocytes subsequently resulted in
a dose-dependent increase in rbc parameters. by day 21, reticulocyte
values were similar or lower than baseline values across all doses. a
decrease below baseline values likely represents negative feedback
mechanisms secondary to the  xxxd2861xxx -induced polycythemia. the
duration of the increase in both reticulocytes and rbc parameters was
also dose-dependent.
on day 14, mean rbc counts were 5.83 6 0.513, 6.17 6 0.533,
and 6.72 6 0.316  106/ml at 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively,
compared with concurrent vehicle control levels of 5.48 6 0.384 
106/ml. the increase in rbcs, which reached statistical significance at
doses of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg, corresponded to hemoglobin increases of
0.50 6 0.424, 1.40 6 0.408, and 2.95 6 1.25 g/dl at 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5
mg/kg, respectively, compared with predose levels. the increases
from predose levels in rbcs on day 21 were 0.025 6 0.114, 0.330 6
0.075, and 0.855 6 0.166 106/ml for 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 mg
 xxxd2861xxx /kg, respectively, reaching statistical significance at all
dose levels. by day 35, rbc counts in the 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg groups
remained elevated. the increase, however, was statistically significant
compared with the concurrent vehicle control group at only the high

the rbc and reticulocyte data were expressed and analyzed as previously
described. total radioactivity in whole blood samples was determined by
combustion then liquid scintillation counting (lsc) analyses and plasma
samples by lsc analyses. the pk parameters were calculated as previously
described.
quantitative whole-body autoradiography preparation. carcasses from
animals euthanized at 48 hours, 1 week, and 3 weeks after dosing were
immediately frozen in a hexane-dry ice bath for approximately 1 hour.
following embedding, the carcasses were cut into sagittal sections (40 mm
thick) using a cm3600 cryomicrotome (leica, nussloch, germany) and then
mounted on cardboard backing. a set of sections from each animal were
exposed to 14c-sensitive phosphorimaging plates (fuji biomedical, stamford,
ct) for a 4-day exposure period. tissue radioactivity concentrations were
quantified from the whole-body autoradiograms using a validated image
analysis system [typhoon 9410 image acquisition system (ge healthcare/
molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca) and mcid image analysis software
(v. 6.0 and 7.0; ge healthcare/imaging research, inc., st. catherines, ontario,
canada)]. a set of 14c-blood calibration standards (range was approximately
0.0007–6.5 mci/g) applied to 14c-sensitive phosphorimaging plates (fuji
biomedical) was used as the calibration standard.
microautoradiography preparation. liver, spleen, thymus, mesenteric
lymph nodes, axillary lymph nodes, sternum, bone marrow (femur), kidney
cortex, kidney medulla, and kidney papilla were immediately removed from
one of the animals euthanized at 48 hours postdose and were prepared for
marg analysis. tissues were cut into blocks of approximately 0.5 cm2. each
block was mounted on a cryosectioning stage and quick-frozen in isopentane
cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. cryosections were collected (5 mm
in thickness, chamber temperature approximately 225°c) and thaw-mounted
under darkroom conditions onto slides previously coated with nuclear
photographic emulsion (ntb; kodak, rochester, ny). slides were exposed
and then developed in kodak d19 developer and fixed with kodak fixer. slides
were co-stained with hematoxylin and eosin for geographic orientation.

dose of 0.5 mg/kg. a significant elevation in rbc counts persisted
through day 42 in the 0.5 mg/kg group, with increases over concurrent
controls of 0.453 6 0.389 106/ml. by day 63, values across all dose
groups were similar to or approached the levels of the concurrent
control group.
the [14c] xxxd2861xxx -induced erythropoiesis following an i.v. dose
of 2.1 mg/kg was characterized by an initial increase in reticulocytes
and a subsequent time-dependent increase in rbcs (fig. 3). twentyone days following administration of radiolabeled  xxxd2861xxx , there
was an increase in rbcs of 1.73  106/ml. the kinetics of the
erythropoietic response, including magnitude of response, following
administration of unlabeled 2 mg/kg  xxxd2861xxx  was similar to that
obtained with radiolabeled material. specifically, there was an
increase in rbcs of 1.67  106/ml 21 days after the administration
of unlabeled  xxxd2861xxx  (woodburn et al., 2008b). the data support,
therefore, that radiolabeling does not interfere with the pharmacologic
activity of  xxxd2861xxx .
pharmacokinetics. plasma concentrations of  xxxd2861xxx  were
sustained for at least 72 hours postdose following a single i.v. dose at
0.1 mg/kg, at least 168 hours postdose at 0.5 mg/kg, and for at least
504 hours postdose at 5 mg/kg (fig. 4). the pk parameters are
provided in table 1. the cmax values increased in a roughly doseproportional manner between the doses of 0.1 and 5 mg/kg, while the

increase in auc0–inf was greater than dose-proportional. following
a 5-fold increase in dose from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg, there was an
approximately 8- to 9-fold increase in auc. following a 10-fold

increase in dose from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg, there was an approximately 19to 21-fold increase in auc.
the cl was typically low, decreasing from 1.22 to 0.435 ml/h per
kg across the dose range of 0.1–5 mg/kg, and was only a fraction of
the estimated monkey glomerular filtration rate (gfr) of 125 ml/h per
kg (davies and morris, 1993). the half-life (t1/2) of  xxxd2861xxx ,
consequently, increased as a function of dose. the vss, which was low
and apparently independent of dose, ranged from 32.0 to 41.4 ml/kg
over 0.1–5 mg/kg and approximated the plasma volume of 44.8 ml/kg
described for monkeys (davies and morris, 1993). the volume of
distribution, therefore, suggests that  xxxd2861xxx  is generally confined
to the vascular compartment. because the kinetics of  xxxd2861xxx  are
nonlinear, in the absence of any further data, cl values may have been
in flux over the time course of the study (i.e., cl low at earlier time
points characterized by high plasma concentrations and higher at later
time points characterized by lower plasma concentrations of  xxxd2861xxx ).
the cl values, therefore, may represent time- and concentration-dependent
averaged values.
the plasma pk of [14c] xxxd2861xxx  was evaluated in an excretion study and a qwba study in male cynomolgus monkeys following a single i.v. administration of 5 or 2.1 mg/kg, respectively. the
pk parameters, including measured cmax (i.e., measured at the first
sampling time point), auc, t1/2, cl, and vss, for unlabeled  xxxd2861xxx  as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
analysis, were similar to the kinetics derived via quantitative radiometric (hplc fractionation) profiling at a dose of 5 mg/kg (table 1).
the measured cmax, auc, cl, and t1/2 obtained in the qwba study
at 2.1 mg/kg (unpublished data) were similar to the toxicokinetic
values obtained at a dose of 2 mg/kg administered in a 9-month
toxicology study in monkeys (woodburn et al., 2008b). the data

indicate that radiolabeling  xxxd2861xxx  does not alter the pk profile of
the molecule and that the analytical methods yield comparable results
at a given dose level.
the pk in the qwba monkeys was characterized in both blood
and plasma. regardless of the biologic matrix, cl was low (0.885 and
0.520 ml/kg per hour for blood and plasma, respectively) and half-life
was prolonged (approximately 70 hours in blood or plasma). at all pk
time points, radioactivity concentration was greater in plasma than
blood. the blood-to-plasma ratios ranged from 0.466 to 0.622,
indicating minimal association with blood cells and demonstrating
that the majority of [14c] xxxd2861xxx  was confined to the plasma
compartment.
quantitative whole-body autoradiography study-tissue distribution. representative whole-body autoradiograms from male
cynomolgus monkeys at 48 hours, 1 week, and 3 weeks postdose
following a single i.v. administration of [14c] xxxd2861xxx  at 2.1 mg/
kg are depicted in fig. 5. drug-derived radioactivity was widely
distributed at 48 hours postdose throughout the tissues with the
exception of the central nervous system separated from the vasculature
by the blood-brain barrier. tissue distribution, however, was slow as
evidenced by tissue/plasma ratios generally ,1 through at least 48–72
hours postdose. based on the sustained blood and plasma levels of
[14c] xxxd2861xxx  (t1/2 of approximately 70 hours), the tissue distribution demonstrated by qwba analysis at 48 hours is considered
likely to reflect the presence of drug within the vascular/lymphatic
space of the individual tissues (e.g., confinement of radiolabel to the
vascular compartment). accumulation of radioactivity (tissue concentrations higher than blood) in spleen, lymph node, bone marrow,
adrenal gland, and pituitary gland was observed 1 week following
administration. persistently high levels of radioactivity were also observed in the urine through 1 week following administration, supporting renal clearance as a major route of excretion (table 2).
the highest concentrations of tissue radioactivity or measured cmax
(i.e., measured values at $48 hours ranging from approximately
6.5–29 mg equiv/g) were found, based on rank order from highest to
lowest, to occur in the red pulp of the spleen, blood, lung, renal
medulla, adrenal medulla and capsule, and the highly vascularized
nasal turbinates. tissues with the lowest exposure (i.e., cmax at 48
hours ,1.0 mg equiv/g) included bone, skeletal muscle, small
intestine contents, brain, and spinal cord. concentrations in urine/
bladder were notably higher than bile or intestinal contents at each
time point throughout the study, supporting renal excretion as a primary route of elimination.
at 1 week postdose, the concentrations of radioactivity were
decreasing in the majority of the tissues except in the spleen, lymph
node, bone marrow, and adrenal gland. in these tissues, radioactivity
concentrations were increasing, which suggested partitioning of
 xxxd2861xxx . concentrations of radioactivity increased through 3
weeks for the spleen and lymph node and pronounced levels persisted

in the bone marrow and adrenal gland. the bone marrow had sustained levels that remained fairly constant throughout the study,
ranging from 2.32 to 4.93 mg equiv/g, although values appeared to
be decreasing by the final time point in the study at 3 weeks
postdose.
elimination of the radioactivity was not complete by the end of the
study, but tissue concentrations had generally declined at 3 weeks with

the levels in most tissues ,1 mg equiv/g of tissue. the exceptions
were the spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and
pituitary gland. the radioactivity levels in the spleen and lymph nodes
remained increased compared with 48 hours but were similar for week
1 versus week 3. the radioactivity levels in the bone marrow, adrenal
gland, and pituitary gland were approximately 53, 36, and 56% lower,
respectively, at week 3 compared with week 1.

microautoradiography. microautoradiography analyses at 48
hours postdose revealed uniform distribution of radioactivity in the
bone marrow and liver. radioactivity within the bone marrow
extracted from the femur was uniform and relatively high (fig. 6a).
there was no obvious cell-associated accumulation of radioactivity.
bone matrix did not contain radioactivity (not shown). moderate
distribution of radioactivity was seen throughout the marrow cells of
the sternum. similarly, the radioactivity in the liver (fig. 6d) and
thymus (not shown) was scattered and light.
microautoradiography demonstrated differential distribution in the
spleen and, to a lesser extent, the lymph nodes. a notable differential
distribution was observed between red and white pulp of the spleen
(fig. 6b). the marg results are consistent with the qwba data
(table 2) that yielded red pulp/white pulp ratios of 2.56-, 7.8-, and
4.94-to-1 at 48 hours and 1 and 3 weeks, respectively. radioactivity
was diffusely distributed in the axillary and mesenteric lymph nodes,
with only a slight accumulation at the blood/lymphatic vessels and no
cell-specific localization (fig. 6c).
in the kidney, comparable distribution was noted across the
glomeruli, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, and collecting
ducts, blood vessels, and interstitial cells of the renal cortex (fig. 7a).
in the medulla, however, radioactivity was more obvious in the
interstitium. there was less association of radioactivity with the lumen
of the ducts compared with cells in the interstitium (fig. 7b).
similarly, radioactivity in the papilla was associated primarily with
cells in the interstitium, while little was seen in the collecting ducts
(fig. 7c).
excretion. the major route of drug excretion following i.v.
administration of 5 mg/kg [14c] xxxd2861xxx  was in the urine with
lesser amounts excreted in the feces. by 24 hours after administration
of [14c] xxxd2861xxx , the excretion ratios for urine and feces were 12.4 6
2.4% and 0.2 6 0.2% of the radioactive dose, respectively. the
ratios of the radioactive dose excreted into the urine and feces at 96
hours after dosing were 34.3 6 4.6% and 2.2 6 1.6%, respectively.
excretion was not complete by 14 days postdose with approximately
67% of the total radioactive dose excreted by the end of the collection
period. of the total radioactivity excreted by the end of the collections,
approximately 60% was excreted in the urine and approximately 7%
in the feces. of the excreted radioactivity, a large proportion (approximately 34% of the radioactive dose) was excreted in the urine
during the first 96 hours postdose. during the remainder of the study

(i.e., 96–366 hours postdose), the total daily radioactivity excretion
ranged from 1.5 to 5.6% of the administered dose. the extent of
excretion and recovery of the dose administered are depicted in fig. 8
and table 3.
plasma, urine, and fecal metabolite profiles. quantitative
metabolite profiling was performed using pooled plasma, urine, or
fecal samples. the plasma concentration-versus-time profile is depicted in fig. 9.  xxxd2861xxx  was the major component in plasma.
at 0.25 hours postdose, the plasma content of the parent and monopeg was essentially the same as the dose formulation. specifically,

erythropoietic activity of the dimeric peptide portion of  xxxd2861xxx , discovered by screening against human epor (fan et al.,
2006), was enhanced by pegylation with a 40-kda branched peg.
pegylation improves the pk of protein and peptide therapeutics by
reducing renal clearance and protecting the molecule from enzymatic proteolysis or antibody neutralization (caliceti and veronese,
2003; harris and chess, 2003). enhanced erythropoietic activity of
pegylated dimeric peptide (i.e.,  xxxd2861xxx ) is considered largely
a function of prolonged  xxxd2861xxx  plasma levels (green et al.,
2011).
 xxxd2861xxx  plasma pk in monkeys demonstrated a profile
consistent with concentration-dependent processes, exhibiting a
michaelis-menten type saturable elimination. population pk modeling, based on doses of 0.02–0.21 mg/kg, indicated that  xxxd2861xxx 
kinetics in humans is also characterized by michaelis-menten elimination. the near dose-proportional increase in cmax in monkeys suggests a dose-independent initial volume of distribution. a greater than
dose-proportional increase in auc (i.e., 143-fold increase) was related

 xxxd2861xxx  and mono-peg accounted for approximately 90 and 10%
of the total radioactivity, respectively, in both plasma and dose formulation. by 168 hours (day 7) postdose, [14c] xxxd2861xxx  represented over 90% of the total radiolabel in the plasma. at 336 hours
(day 14), [14c] xxxd2861xxx  remained the only major circulating drugrelated component in plasma, with a 14c-auc for the parent molecule
accounting for 87.1% of the total 14c-auc (table 4). the disappearance of mono-peg from plasma appeared to be faster than
 xxxd2861xxx , resulting in a relative exposure of 5.4% of total 14cauc and a half-life of 34.7 hours (table 4). the rate of elimination of
mono-peg versus  xxxd2861xxx  provides further support that the
mono-peg in plasma comes from the impurity in the radiolabeled
preparation, rather than being formed in vivo.
the major moiety in urine was also the parent molecule,  xxxd2861xxx 
(table 3). the cumulative recovery of radioactivity (i.e., at 336 hours
postdose) in the urine associated with  xxxd2861xxx , mono-peg, and
unidentified components was 42.6, 15.9, and 1.2%, respectively, of
the total radioactive dose. the urinary radioactivity of  xxxd2861xxx ,
mono-peg, and unidentified components comprised 71.4, 26.6, and
2.0%, respectively, of the cumulative excreted radioactive dose. the
recovery of  xxxd2861xxx  and mono-peg in the feces was below the
limit of quantification. unidentified components (other) represented
7% of the administered radioactive dose or 100% of the fecal
radioactivity.

primates. (greaves and faccini, 1992; o’malley et al., 2005). furthermore, unlike in rodents (woodburn et al., 2009), emh has not
been shown to occur in monkeys administered  xxxd2861xxx  up to 20
mg/kg i.v. every 3 weeks for 9 months (woodburn et al., 2008a,b).
under certain pathologic conditions and in response to certain biologic
modifiers, emh has been shown to occur in the spleen, lymph node,
thymus, adrenal gland, pituitary, and kidney of monkeys (welte et al.,
1987; okasaki et al., 2002; starost et al., 2004) and in the spleen of
humans (o’malley et al., 2005). the emh in rodents and, under
certain conditions in primates, may involve the erythroid lineage,
which suggests that epor occurs at these sites and may be or may
become functional. the  xxxd2861xxx  data suggest that although drug
may bind to splenic epor, the receptor was not functional, under the
conditions of the study, since no erythropoietic effect was noted in the
monkeys.
following i.v. administration of  xxxd2861xxx , the pronounced, sustained erythropoietic response increased with increasing dose and
exposure across animal species and in normal healthy volunteers (fan
et al., 2006; stead et al., 2006). a pharmacologically active i.v.
 xxxd2861xxx  dose of 0.1 mg/kg resulted in an average maximum
change in baseline hemoglobin of 1.36 g/dl in normal healthy volunteers
(stead et al., 2006) and of 1.4 g/dl in monkeys. the apparently more
pronounced effect in rodents likely reflects the robust peginesatideassociated emh response in the spleen and liver.
a greater erythropoietic response in 5/6 nephrectomized rats
compared with normal animals is likely due to at least two factors,
including altered pk (i.e., a 2-fold slower clearance and higher
exposures) and diminished activity in nephrectomized rats of the
negative feedback controls on erythropoiesis that would come into
play following administration of  xxxd2861xxx  in normal animals (fan
et al., 2006). the nephrectomized rat findings are consistent with data
in clinical trials of  xxxd2861xxx  showing an enhanced pharmacological
response, decreased cl, and an increase in half-life in ckd patients
compared with normal healthy volunteers.
the adme and pharmacology of  xxxd2861xxx  have been extensively evaluated in monkeys. the similarity in pk and pharmacology parameters for monkeys and humans suggests that the monkey
data can be extrapolated to humans and that the monkey is an appropriate species for evaluating  xxxd2861xxx  effects. the robust, sustained erythropoietic response in monkeys is consistent with the
clinical data demonstrating that once monthly dosing of  xxxd2861xxx 
maintains hemoglobin in dialysis patients.

are consistent with the literature suggesting that pegylation may
lower rme (webster et al., 2007) due to lower receptor affinity. a
64% decrease in clearance associated with a 50-fold increase in
 xxxd2861xxx  was observed at higher doses in the normal monkey and
may reflect saturation of receptor and nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms. the decrease in  xxxd2861xxx  clearance in the rat renal-failure
model may reflect saturation of receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated
mechanisms to a greater or lesser extent, in addition to decreased
gfr.
monkey distribution data should be interpreted and extrapolated to
humans within the context of dose differences. while a 0.1 mg/kg
dose in the monkey is 2.5-fold higher than the human starting dose of
0.04 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks, the 5 mg/kg dose is 125-fold
higher than the human starting dose. the nonclinical doses were
selected to obtain a recommended targeted radioactive dose of 16–300
mci/kg (solon et al., 2010) and based on the achievable specific
activity of [14c] xxxd2861xxx . administration of lower clinically
relevant doses would not have delivered adequate radioactivity for
the determination of tissue distribution using both qwba and marg
analyses.
radioactivity concentrations were decreasing in most tissues in the
monkey at 1 week postdose. the increased radioactivity concentration
in spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and urine suggests a partitioning of  xxxd2861xxx  into these tissues or increased
excretion (urine). the relatively high  xxxd2861xxx -associated radioactivity levels in the lymphatic tissues may reflect the uptake or removal
of the macromolecule, transport to the draining lymph nodes, and the
potential processing and/or degradation of the molecule (porter et al.,
2001).
the ability to collect potentially meaningful quantitative tissue
distribution data with  xxxd2861xxx  is in contrast to approved proteinbased esas. radiolabeling of proteins, such as rhuepo and darbepoetin
alfa, with iodine-125 can lead to results confounded by label instability
with cleavage and uptake of free label into various tissues by transporters (solon, 2012). for  xxxd2861xxx , 14c can be used to radiolabel
the lysine linker between the peptide dimer and the two 20-kda peg
chains.
 xxxd2861xxx  biodistribution data may potentially provide insight
into the biodistribution of esas and perhaps even epor sites. the
data suggest that  xxxd2861xxx  is localized to known epor sites (bone
marrow), sites that may have functional epor (e.g., splenic red
pulp), and putative epor sites such as the renal medulla and papilla
(westenfelder et al., 1999). there is considerable controversy, however, with respect to not only epor distribution, but whether the epor
is functional if expressed on cells other than hematopoietic progenitor
cells.
the bone marrow is the primary hematopoietic site in monkeys.
unlike rodents, in which notable emh occurs throughout the animal’s
lifespan, emh does not normally occur in nonhuman and human
