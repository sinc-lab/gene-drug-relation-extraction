estradiol, the most potent endogenous estrogen, is biosynthesized from androgens by the cytochrome p450 enzyme complex called aromatase. aromatase is present in breast tissue,
and intratumoral aromatase is the source of local estrogen
production in breast cancer tissues. inhibition of aromatase
is an important approach for reducing growth-stimulatory
effects of estrogens in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. steroidal inhibitors that have been developed to date build upon
the basic androstenedione nucleus and incorporate chemical
substituents at varying positions on the steroid. nonsteroidal
aromatase inhibitors can be divided into three classes:  xxxd147xxx -like molecules, imidazole/triazole derivatives, and flavonoid analogs. mechanism-based aromatase inhibitors are steroidal inhibitors that mimic the substrate, are
converted by the enzyme to a reactive intermediate, and result in the inactivation of aromatase. both steroidal and non-

steroidal aromatase inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in
the treatment of breast cancer. the potent and selective thirdgeneration aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, letrozole, and
exemestane, were introduced into the market as endocrine
therapy in postmenopausal patients failing antiestrogen therapy alone or multiple hormonal therapies. these agents are
currently approved as first-line therapy for the treatment of
postmenopausal women with metastatic estrogen-dependent
breast cancer. several clinical studies of aromatase inhibitors
are currently focusing on the use of these agents in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of early breast cancer. use of an
aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment with
tamoxifen is now recommended as adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal woman with hormone-dependent
breast cancer. (endocrine reviews 26: 331–345, 2005)

2004 (1). currently, one of eight american women will develop
breast cancer in her lifetime. approximately two thirds of postmenopausal breast cancer patients have hormone-dependent
(estrogen-dependent) breast cancer, which contains estrogen
receptors and requires estrogen for tumor growth. estrogens
produce normal physiological effects by binding to specific
nuclear receptor proteins,  xxxg730xxx -␣ and  xxxg730xxx -␤ (2). the predominant  xxxg730xxx  in the female
reproductive tract and mammary glands is  xxxg730xxx -␣.
following the binding of estrogen to its receptor, the estrogenreceptor complexes form homodimers and interact with sequence-specific estrogen response elements present in the promoter region of responsive genes in target cell chromatin.
binding of the nuclear steroid-receptor complexes to dna and
interaction with various nuclear transcriptional factors, such as
steroid receptor coactivator proteins, initiate the transcription of
the relevant gene to produce mrna. the elevated mrna levels result in increased protein synthesis in the endoplasmic
reticulum. these proteins include enzymes, receptors, and secreted factors that subsequently result in the steroid hormonal
response regulating cell function, growth, and differentiation.
estrogens enhance growth and proliferation of certain target
cells, such as breast epithelial cells and estrogen-dependent
mammary carcinoma cells, and induce the formation and secretion of various growth factors in established cell lines such
as mcf-7, t47d, and zr-75–1 human mammary carcinoma
lines (3).

i. introduction

strogens are involved in numerous physiological
processes including the development and maintenance of
the female sexual organs, the reproductive cycle, reproduction,
and various neuroendocrine functions. these hormones also
have crucial roles in certain disease states, particularly in mammary and endometrial carcinomas. cancer is the leading cause
of death among women between the ages of 30 and 54, with
breast and uterine cancers comprising 28% and 10%, respectively, of all cancers in females per year. an estimated 217,440
new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed, and 40,580 women
in the united states were projected to die from breast cancer in

331

p450 enzyme complex called “aromatase” (4), with the highest levels of enzyme present in the ovaries of premenopausal
women, in the placenta of pregnant women, and in the peripheral adipose tissues of postmenopausal women and of
men. aromatase activity has also been demonstrated in
breast tissue in vitro (5–7). furthermore, expression of aromatase is highest in or near breast tumor sites (6, 8).
the enzyme complex is bound in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell and is comprised of two major proteins (4,
9). one protein is cytochrome p450arom, a hemoprotein that
converts c19 steroids (androgens) into c18 steroids (estrogens) containing a phenolic a ring (4, 10). the second protein
is nadph-cytochrome p450 reductase, which transfers reducing equivalents to cytochrome p450arom. three moles of
nadph and three moles of oxygen are used in the conversion of one mole of substrate into one mole of estrogen
product (fig. 1). aromatization of androstenedione, the preferred substrate, proceeds via three successive oxidation
steps, with the first two being hydroxylations of the angular
c-19 methyl group. the final oxidation step proceeds with
the aromatization of the a ring of the steroid and loss of the
c-19 carbon atom as  xxxd2154xxx .
this third and final step in the aromatase reaction oxidatively cleaves the c10-c19 bond, although the mechanism of
this step remains to be elucidated. a number of mechanisms
have been proposed, and one mechanism for the oxidative
deformylation step that has received significant favor involves nucleophilic attack of the 19-aldehyde by the reduced
ferrous dioxygen, or peroxy, intermediate (fig. 2a). the resulting peroxo hemiacetal is suggested to decay via a process
by which the proximal oxygen atom removes the 1␤-hydrogen, resulting in aromatization of the steroid a ring and
 xxxd2154xxx  release (11). model reaction studies have suggested that formation of the 2,3-enol is a prerequisite for
aromatization. a homology model of the aromatase enzyme
suggests the presence of an  xxxd233xxx  residue near the
2␤-hydrogen and lysine or histidine residues near the 3-ketone of androstenedione (12). the orientation of these residues is supportive of an enzyme acid-base-catalyzed enolization process to selectively remove the 2␤-hydrogen.

recently, our laboratory has employed computational chemistry approaches to unravel the mysterious third step of
aromatase catalysis (13). recent advances in computational
chemistry, including density functional theory alone or in
combination with molecular mechanical methods, have provided better tools that enable study of the active species in
their native protein environment, such as the cytochrome
p450 oxidant compound i (14). a model system of the cytochrome p450 active site and truncated steroid substrates
has been studied using density functional theory calculations
and ab initio molecular dynamics. analysis for the reduced
ferrous dioxygen (peroxy) intermediate suggests that 1␤hydrogen atom abstraction by the proximal oxygen of the
peroxo hemiacetal intermediates encounters a high energetic
barrier (⬎60 kcal/mol) that is enzymatically inaccessible.
also, the resulting species do not directly fragment to the
experimentally observed  xxxd2154xxx  and aromatized steroid
products. a novel, alternative mechanism was examined, in
which the widely accepted cytochrome p450 oxidant compound i, the iron oxene catalytic intermediate (fig. 2b), abstracts the 1␤-hydrogen atom initiating the aromatization
and deformylation cascade. the steroid models that contain
the 2,3-enol moiety have a strikingly low barrier for 1␤hydrogen atom abstraction (⬍7 kcal/mol) due to the ability
of the enolized a ring to delocalize the impending radical.
the transition states containing the 2,3-enol moiety and the
19-gem diol decay directly to the aromatized product, formic
acid, and the aqua-bound model cytochrome p450 enzyme.
analysis of the reaction vectors indicate that the second
hydrogen transfer occurs with a concerted, nonsynchronous
mechanism without an energetic barrier. thus, these calculations support a final catalytic step of aromatase involving
the cytochrome p450 oxene intermediate, 1␤-hydrogen atom
abstraction, and release of  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. 2).
b. aromatase gene expression

over the past two decades, knowledge of the biochemistry, molecular biology, and regulation of aromatase has increased greatly. the aromatase gene, designated  xxxg574xxx , en-

codes the cytochrome p450arom, and this gene is located on
chromosome 15q21.1. the coding region is approximately 30
kb in size, and the regulatory region is approximately 93 kb
(9, 15). the aromatase gene consists of 10 exons, and its
full-length cdna of 3.4 kb encodes for a protein of 503 amino
acids. the aromatase protein is a glycosylated cytochrome
p450 protein with a molecular mass of approximately 58,000
da (16). the regulation of aromatase is complex in various
tissues, and several tissue-specific promoter regions have
been identified upstream from the  xxxg574xxx  gene (9, 17, 18).
these tissue-specific promoters include promoter pi.1, pi.3,
pi.4, pi.6, pi.7, and pii (fig. 3). promoter pi.1 is the major
promoter used in placental tissues and is the farthest upstream. the pii promoter is used in the ovary and in breast
cancer tissues, and it contains a camp response element.
promoters pi.3, pi.4, pi.6, and pi.7 are the promoters used in
extraglandular sites. promoter pi.4 is the primary promoter
used in normal adipose tissue and is responsive to glucocorticoids and cytokines such as il-1␤, il-6, and tnf␣. promoter pi.3 is also present in adipose tissues such as normal
breast tissue and is elevated in breast cancer tissues.
c. aromatase in breast cancer tissues

aromatase is found in breast tissue, and the importance of
intratumoral aromatase and local estrogen production is being unraveled (6, 19, 20). aromatase has been measured in
the stromal cell component of normal breast and breast tu-

mors, but the enzyme has also been detected in the breast
epithelial cells in vitro (5, 8, 20 –22). furthermore, expression
of aromatase is highest in or near breast tumor sites (8, 20).
the exact cellular location(s) of aromatase must await more
rigorous analysis by several laboratories with a new monoclonal antibody now being developed and evaluated (23).
the increased expression of aromatase cytochrome
p450arom observed in breast cancer tissues is associated with
a switch in the major promoter region used in gene expression, with promoter pii being the predominant promoter
used in breast cancer tissues (24). as a result of the use of the
alternate promoter, the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis
switches from one controlled primarily by glucocorticoids
and cytokines to a promoter regulated through camp-mediated pathways (24).  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) increases intracellular camp levels and stimulates estrogen biosynthesis
(24), whereas other autocrine factors such as il-1␤ do not
appear to act via pge2 (25).
local production of pge2 via the cyclooxygenase
isozymes (constitutive cox-1 isozyme and inducible cox-2
isozyme) can influence estrogen biosynthesis and estrogendependent breast cancer. this biochemical mechanism may
explain epidemiological observations of the beneficial effects
of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) on breast
cancer (26 –29). investigations using human breast cancer
patient specimens demonstrated a strong linear correlation
between  xxxg574xxx  expression and the sum of cox-1 and cox-2
expression (30). gene expression analysis for  xxxg574xxx , cox-1,
and cox-2 were performed in 20 human breast cancer specimens and in five normal control breast tissue samples. a
positive correlation was observed between  xxxg574xxx  expression and the greater extent of breast cancer cellularity (fig.
4a), in agreement with literature reports showing that aromatase levels were higher in tumors than in normal tissue.
furthermore, a positive linear correlation was observed between cox-2 expression breast cancer cellularity in each
sample. linear regression analysis using a bivariate model
shows a strong linear association between  xxxg574xxx  expression
and the sum of cox-1 and cox-2 expression (fig. 4b). similar correlations between  xxxg574xxx  expression and cox-2 expression in breast cancer patient specimens have been confirmed in other laboratories (31). this significant relationship
between the aromatase and cox enzyme systems suggests

that autocrine and paracrine mechanisms may be involved in
hormone-dependent breast cancer development via growth
stimulation from local estrogen biosynthesis. in human
breast stromal cells, pge2 acts via two g protein-coupled
receptors, ep1 and  xxxg1873xxx  receptors, to stimulate aromatase gene
expression via  xxxg1836xxx  and protein kinase c signaling pathways (32). nsaids and cox-1- and cox-2-selective inhibitors produce dose-dependent decreases in aromatase activity in breast cancer tissues (fig. 5) (33, 34). real
time pcr analysis of aromatase gene expression showed a
significant decrease in mrna levels by these agents, and the
effect of cox inhibitors on aromatase expression occurs
through suppression at the tissue-specific promoters pi.3,
pi.4, and pii. this significant relationship between the aromatase and cox enzyme systems suggests that autocrine
and paracrine mechanisms may be involved in hormone-

dependent breast cancer development via growth stimulation from local estrogen biosynthesis (fig. 6).
iii. development of aromatase inhibitors

two primary approaches have been developed to reduce
the growth-stimulatory effects of estrogens in breast cancer:
1) interfering with the ability of estrogen to bind to its receptor; and 2) decreasing circulating levels of estrogen. antiestrogens compete for binding to the estrogen receptors and
reduce the number of receptors available for binding to endogenous estrogen. this approach has proven effective as an
anticancer strategy (35, 36) and has led to the development
of efficacious antiestrogens, such as the drug tamoxifen, that
exhibit minimal toxicity. inhibition of aromatase is the second approach for reducing growth-stimulatory effects of
estrogens. effective aromatase inhibitors have been developed as therapeutic agents for controlling estrogen-dependent breast cancer. investigations on the development of
aromatase inhibitors began in the 1970s and have expanded
greatly in the past three decades. research summaries of
aromatase inhibitors have been presented at international
aromatase conferences (37– 41), and several reviews have
also been published (42–51).

biochemical evaluation of competitive inhibitors (52–54).
competitive inhibitors are molecules that compete with the
substrate androstenedione for noncovalent binding to the
active site of the enzyme to decrease the amount of product
formed. the term “apparent ki” represents the equilibrium
constant for the reversible binding of the enzyme and the
inhibitor. the values are used in comparisons of inhibitors,
and the smaller the ki value, the better the inhibitor. steroidal
inhibitors that have been developed to date build upon this
basic androstenedione nucleus and incorporate chemical
substituents at varying positions on the steroid (fig. 7). these
inhibitors bind to the aromatase cytochrome p450 enzyme in
the same manner as the substrate androstenedione. initial
structure-activity relationships were developed with these
early investigations on competitive aromatase inhibitors. in
summary, effective inhibition is observed with an androstane steroid molecule possessing an a/b trans ring junction,
a ketone functionality at the c-3 position, unsaturation in the
steroid nucleus (4-ene, 4,6-diene, or 1,4,6-diene functions),
and either a 17-ketone or 17␣-hydroxyl moiety.
a limited number of effective inhibitors with substituents
on the a ring have been reported. several steroidal aromatase inhibitors contain modifications at the c-4 position,
with  xxxd2153xxx  being the prototype agent.
initially,  xxxd2153xxx  was thought to be a
competitive inhibitor with an apparent ki of approximately
170 nm, but the compound was later shown to produce
enzyme-mediated inactivation. the spacial requirements of
the a ring for binding of the steroidal inhibitor to aromatase
are rather restrictive, permitting only small structural modifications to be made. incorporation of the polar hydroxyl
group at c-4 enhances inhibitory activity. 1-methylandrosta1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx  is a potent inhibitor of aromatase in vitro
and in vivo (55); on the other hand, bulky substitutents at the
1␣-position are poor inhibitors (54).
extensive structural modifications may be made on the b
ring of the steroid nucleus. bulky substitutions at the c-7
position of the b ring have provided several very potent
aromatase inhibitors (54). one of the more potent inhibitors,
7␣-(4⬘-amino)phenylthio- xxxd176xxx  with an
apparent ki of 18 nm, demonstrated effectiveness in inhibiting aromatase in cell cultures and in treating hormone-

dependent rat mammary tumors (56 –58). evaluation of
various substituted aromatic analogs of 7␣-(4⬘-amino)phenylthio- xxxd176xxx  provided no correlation between the electronic character of the substituents and inhibitory activity. investigations of various 7-substituted
androsta-4,6-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx  derivatives suggest that only
those derivatives that can project the 7-aryl substitutent into
the 7␣-pocket are effective inhibitors (59). several compounds with substituents at the c-6 position have been described which exhibit irreversible inhibition; these are discussed in a later section. overall, the most effective b ringmodified aromatase inhibitors are those with 7␣-aryl
derivatives, with several analogs having 2–10 times greater
affinity for the enzyme than the substrate. these results suggest that additional interactions occur between the phenyl
ring at the 7␣-position and amino acids at or near the enzymatic site of aromatase, resulting in enhanced affinity.
the other position of androstenedione that has received
considerable investigation and has resulted in effective inhibitors is the c-19 methyl position, the site of enzymatic
oxidation. competitive inhibitors have been designed to enhance affinity through noncovalent binding of a heteroatom
at c-19 with the heme iron of the cytochrome p450arom.
19-substituted aromatase inhibitors include thiiranes and
oxiranes (60, 61), epoxysteroids (62), and thiol and amino
analogs (63, 64). the 19r-isomers of the thiiranes and oxiranes were potent inhibitors with apparent ki values ranging from 1–7 nm, showed affinity 36- to 80-fold greater than
the corresponding 19s-isomers, and demonstrated binding
to the heme iron in spectroscopic studies. unique 2,19bridged androstenediones have also been reported (65– 67).
these a ring-bridged steroids consist of both five-membered
and six-membered ring analogs containing carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen, or sulfur atoms. several of these compounds exhibited apparent ki values in the low nanomolar range and
demonstrated tight-binding competitive inhibition. thus, effective inhibitors have been prepared with geometrically
small functionalities at the c-19 position, suggesting that the
enzyme active site can accommodate small changes in
structure.
2. mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors. a mechanism-based inhibitor is an inhibitor that mimics the substrate, is converted
by the enzyme to a reactive intermediate, and results in the
inactivation of the enzyme. the term “mechanism-based” is
used because the inhibitor contains a chemical functionality
that is acted upon by the enzyme during the normal catalytic
process. a mechanism-based inhibitor produces time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme only in the presence of catalytically active enzyme; omission of a cofactor, such as
nadph, does not produce inactivation. other terms that are
used for these inhibitors are “enzyme-activated irreversible
inhibitors,” “suicide substrates,” and “suicide inactivators.”
several mechanism-based aromatase inhibitors, structurally
related to the natural substrate androstenedione (fig. 8), are
initially recognized by the aromatase enzyme as alternate
substrates and are then transformed (through an nadphdependent mechanism) to reactive intermediates, which
bind irreversibly to the enzyme and produce inactivation.
inactivation kinetic values are determined from plots of the

half-time of inactivation, i.e., the time required to decrease
the enzymatic activity by 50%, vs. the reciprocal of the inhibitor concentration. the y-intercept of the resulting line is
the half-time of inactivation at infinite inhibitor concentration (t1/2) and the rate of inactivation, apparent kinact, is equal
to 0.693/t1/2. the most effective mechanism-based inhibitors
exhibit short half-times of inactivation (t1/2) and rapid rates
of inactivation. mechanism-based inhibitors have distinct
advantages in drug design, because these inhibitors are
highly enzyme specific, produce prolonged inhibition, and
often exhibit minimal toxicities.
the first compound designed as a mechanism-based inhibitor of aromatase was 10-propargyl-4-estrene-3, xxxd2153xxx 
(mdl 18,962); it was synthesized and studied independently
by three research groups (68 –70). mdl 18,962 has an electron-rich alkynyl function on the c-19 carbon atom, the site
of aromatase-mediated oxidation of the substrate, and is an
effective inhibitor in vitro and in vivo (71–74). in biochemical
assays, mdl 18,962 exhibited a half-time of inactivation at
infinite inhibitor concentration (t1/2) of 10.41 min and an
apparent kinact of 1.11 ⫻ 10⫺3 sec⫺1. although the identity of
the reactive intermediate formed is not known, an oxirene
and a michael acceptor have been suggested.
a larger number of mechanism-based inhibitors have developed from more detailed biochemical investigations of
several inhibitors originally thought to be competitive inhibitors. these inhibitors can be grouped into the general
categories of 4-substituted androst-4-ene-3,17-diones, substituted androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-diones, and 6-methylene- or
6-oxo-androst-4-ene-3,17-diones.
4-hydroxy- xxxd176xxx  ( xxxd2153xxx ,  xxxd2153xxx ), originally thought to be a competitive inhibitor, produces enzyme-mediated inactivation (75). in enzyme assays,  xxxd2153xxx  exhibited a halftime of inactivation at infinite inhibitor concentration (t1/2) of
2.57 min and an apparent kinact of 4.50 ⫻ 10⫺3 sec⫺1. in vivo,
 xxxd2153xxx  inhibits reproductive processes (76) and causes
regression of hormone-dependent mammary rat tumors (77,
78).  xxxd2153xxx  is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women
(79, 80); however, extensive first-pass metabolism of this
agent in the liver necessitates im administration and limits its
use (81– 83).

brueggemeier et al. • aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer therapy

numerous androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-diones have been prepared and have demonstrated mechanism-based or enzymemediated inactivation of aromatase in vitro. androsta1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx  and androsta-1,4,6-triene-3, xxxd2153xxx 
were initially thought to be competitive inhibitors, but
further examination of the biochemistry of these inhibitors
revealed that these compounds demonstrated inactivation
of aromatase only in the presence of cofactors (84, 85).
introduction of substituents at the 7␣-position of both
androsta-1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx  and androsta-1,4,6-triene3, xxxd2153xxx  have resulted in very effective mechanismbased inhibitors of aromatase (57, 86 – 89). 7␣-(4⬘-amino)
phenylthioandrosta-1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx  has high affinity
for aromatase, with an apparent ki of 9.9 nm, and has the
most rapid rate of inactivation reported to date with a
half-time of inactivation (t1/2) of 1.38 min and an apparent
kinact of 8.40 ⫻ 10⫺3 sec⫺1. more metabolically stable inhibitors were synthesized by replacing the thioether linkage at the 7␣-position with a carbon-carbon linkage. the
best inactivator of the series was the 7␣-phenpropylandrosta-1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx , which exhibited a t1/2 of 6.08
min and an apparent kinact of 1.90 ⫻ 10⫺3 sec⫺1.
an exocyclic double bond at the c-6 carbon atom results
in 6-methyleneandrost-1,4-diene-3, xxxd2153xxx  (exemestane),
which produces aromatase inactivation in vitro and causes
regression of hormone-dependent mammary rat tumors (90 –
92). exemestane is a potent inhibitor of both human placental
aromatase with apparent ki of 26 nm, a t1/2 of 13.9 min, and
an apparent kinact of 8.30 ⫻ 10⫺4 sec⫺1. exemestane, when
administered sc or orally, inhibits rat ovarian aromatase
(ed50 of 1.8 and 3.7 mg/kg, respectively) (90, 93).
despite the large number of effective mechanism-based
or enzyme-activated inhibitors that have been prepared,
no detailed mechanism(s) of action have been identified.
all agents produce time-dependent inactivation of aromatase activity only when incubated with catalytically
active enzyme, no inactivation is observed in the absence
of cofactors such as nadph, and coincubations with the
substrate androstenedione decrease the rates of inactivation. investigations of radiolabeled mechanism-based inhibitors, [125i]-7␣-(4⬘-iodo)phenylthioandrosta-1,4-diene3, xxxd2153xxx  and [14c]-mdl 18,962, provided the first
evidence of irreversible binding of these inhibitors to the
aromatase protein (94). radiolabeled inhibitors were incubated with purified reconstituted aromatase preparations and nadph, and the cytochrome p450arom protein
was isolated by gel chromatography after the incubation.
subsequent treatments of the cytochrome p450arom protein
fractions by precipitation, extensive washings, and sdspage demonstrated that the radioactive inhibitors remain
bound to the cytochrome p450arom protein. thus, the
mechanism-based inactivation that occurs is due to irreversible, covalent binding of the inhibitors to the enzyme
protein. the exact nature of the covalent bound(s), the
chemical structures of the bound inhibitors, and the
amino acids involved are yet to be elucidated. additionally, the question of whether the inhibitors are oxidized at
the c-19 position in a manner similar to the substrate
androstenedione before irreversible binding and inactivation remains to be answered.

b. nonsteroidal inhibitors

1. first- and second-generation inhibitors. nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors possess a heteroatom as a common chemical feature and interfere with steroid hydroxylations by the
binding of this heteroatom with the heme iron of the cytochrome p450s (fig. 9). initial nonsteroidal inhibitors were less
enzyme specific and inhibited, to varying degrees, other
cytochrome p450-mediated hydroxylations of steroidogenesis.  xxxd147xxx  was the prototype for nonsteroidal
aromatase inhibitors (95).  xxxd147xxx  was originally
an antiepileptic agent that was removed from the market due
to serious side effects.  xxxd147xxx  inhibited cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  and other enzyme pathways but was more
selective for cytochrome p450arom. the racemic mixture (dlaminoglutethimide) inhibits aromatase with an apparent ki
of 700 nm. the d- xxxd147xxx  stereoisomer is 20-fold
more potent than the l- xxxd147xxx  stereoisomer.
because  xxxd147xxx  was the first aromatase inhibitor to be studied in patients, it is referred to as the firstgeneration aromatase inhibitor.  xxxd147xxx  has
been used in the clinics with some success to treat patients
with advanced breast cancer, but it must be administered
with corticosteroid due to the inhibitory effects on cortisol
and aldosterone biosynthesis (95, 96). although effective at
decreasing aromatization, it also inhibited a number of other
steroidogenic cyp-450 enzymes, which resulted in significant toxicity. the imidazole compound fadrazole is a potent,
competitive inhibitor of aromatase both in vitro and in vivo
(97). fadrazole, referred to as a “second-generation inhibitor,” is more selective than  xxxd147xxx , and its inhibitory activity is 700 times more potent. clinical studies
using fadrazole proved this nonsteroidal inhibitor is effective
in the treatment of some postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. both partial and complete responses
were observed upon treatment with fadrazole. however, this
compound still has some nonselective inhibitory activity
with respect to aldosterone, progesterone, and corticosterone
biosynthesis. the apparent ki for the racemate of fadrazole
in human placental microsomes is 1.6 nm, and the (⫺)-s
isomer is equipotent to the racemate whereas the (⫹)-r isomer has a lower inhibitory activity with an apparent ki of 39
nm (98).

cessfully developed. vorozole potently inhibits aromatase in
numerous in vitro systems, with an apparent ki of 1.3 nm in
human placental microsomes (99). the racemate has been
tested thoroughly, but it is known that the (⫹)-s isomer is 36
times more potent than the (⫺)-r isomer (100). regression of
tumors in a hormone-dependent rat tumor model has been
demonstrated with various doses of vorozole. another triazole analog is anastrozole, which is an achiral triazole derivative (101). anastrozole is a potent aromatase inhibitor
with an ic50 of 15 nm in human placental microsomes. in
vitro, anastrozole has no effect on numerous other p450 enzymes such as,  xxxg570xxx , 11␤-hydroxylase, 18-hydroxylase,
17␣-hydroxylase, and lanosterol-14␣-demethylase. in vivo
studies in monkeys showed that anastrozole, at a dose of less
than 0.2 mg/kg䡠d, reduced peripheral aromatase activity by
50 – 60% (101). the third triazole derivative, letrozole, is a
potent inhibitor of aromatase with an ic50 of 11.5 nm in
human placental microsomes (102). in in vitro studies, letrozole has no effect on the biosynthesis of other steroids such
as aldosterone, progesterone, or corticosterone. in vivo, letrozole was determined to be orally active and to cause regression of tumors in the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene hormone-dependent rat tumor model, and it demonstrated
aromatase inhibition in patients (103). a higher degree of
specificity has been reached with the new generation of triazole derivatives (letrozole and anastrozole). these newer
agents are 100-3000 times more active than  xxxd147xxx , and all inhibit whole-body aromatization by greater than
96%.
3. flavonoid derivatives as inhibitors. flavonoids are plant natural products present in many food sources, including fruits,
vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. the class of flavonoids encompasses flavones, isoflavones, flavanones, and
flavonols, each possessing the  xxxd1757xxx  ring system as
the common chemical scaffold. considerable interest in flavonoids in breast cancer has been stimulated by the hypothesis that these natural products, present in soy and in rye
flour, are dietary factors that may be responsible for the
lower incidence of breast cancer in women from certain regions of the world (104, 105). several flavonoids demonstrate
inhibitory activities of the aromatase enzyme, thus lowering
estrogen biosynthesis and circulating estrogen levels (fig. 10)
(104, 106 –111). however, these natural products demon-

strate numerous biological activities and interact with various enzymes and receptor systems of pharmacological significance, thus limiting their therapeutic usefulness.
strong evidence for the binding of flavones to the active
site of aromatase was obtained by difference spectral absorption studies (106), with  xxxd121xxx  displacing androstenedione from the aromatase active site and inducing
a spectrum consistent with the low-spin state of iron. reduction of the flavone 4-keto group was detrimental to aromatase inhibition by these compounds (107). based on data
obtained from site-directed mutagenesis studies and ligand
docking into a homology model of the aromatase protein, a
binding orientation was predicted in which the a and c rings
of the flavone mimic the c and d rings of the steroid substrate, respectively. the 2-phenyl substituent is oriented in a
region similar to that occupied by the a ring of the steroid.
this analysis places the flavone 4-keto functionality in the
same position as the steroid 19-angular methyl group with
respect to the heme iron (110).
medicinal chemistry approaches to develop synthetic flavonoids, chromone, or xanthone analogs with enhanced aromatase inhibitory activity have identified more selective
and/or more potent agents for future development (112–
114). generally, flavones and flavanones have higher aromatase inhibitory activity than isoflavones (fig. 10). the flavone, chrysin, has an ic50 value of 0.50 ␮m; apigenin, flavone,
flavanone, and quercetin were less efficacious inhibitors with
ic50 values of 1.2, 8, 8, and 12 ␮m, respectively. isoflavones
are significantly less potent as aromatase inhibitors. the most
effective isoflavone inhibitor is  xxxd343xxx  with an ic50
value of 113 ␮m, approximately 20-fold less potent than
chrysin in terms of ic50 values (110, 115). this large difference in potency is the likely reason why there has been little
effort to develop aromatase inhibitors on an isoflavone scaffold. on the other hand, we envisioned introduction of the
proper functional groups on the isoflavone core could result
in the desired aromatase activity. as a proof of principle, a
2-(4-pyridylmethyl)thio functionality was introduced onto
the isoflavone nucleus (fig. 10), and this isoflavone modification afforded a 160-fold enhancement in potency compared with the natural product,  xxxd343xxx  (116). in human
placental microsomal assays, the synthetic pyridyl isoflavone analog, 3-phenyl-7-(phenylmethoxy)-2-[(4⬘-pyridylmethyl)thio]-4h-1-benzopyran-4-one, exhibited an ic50 value
of approximately 210 nm and an apparent ki value of 220 nm.
iv. aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer
a. first- and second-generation aromatase inhibitors

1.  xxxd147xxx .  xxxd147xxx  was the first of
these inhibitors evaluated in clinical studies for treatment of
hormone-dependent breast cancer (117). santen et al. (118)
extensively evaluated the kinetic and hormonal effects of
 xxxd147xxx  in breast cancer and first proposed aromatase inhibition as the primary mechanism of action of
 xxxd147xxx  therapy. numerous clinical trials performed since the early 1980s have demonstrated the clinical
efficacy of combination therapy of  xxxd147xxx  with
corticosteroid replacement (96, 119) in treatment of hormone-

brueggemeier et al. • aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer therapy

dependent breast cancer. however, side effects of lethargy,
ataxia, and morbilliform skin rash and the development of
more potent aromatase inhibitors resulted in cessation of
further development of  xxxd147xxx  for breast cancer.
2.  xxxd2153xxx . the steroidal inhibitor  xxxd2153xxx , generic name of  xxxd2153xxx , was extensively evaluated in clinical trials and was the first aromatase inhibitor approved for general use in europe. in a
series of clinical studies (120),  xxxd2153xxx 
treatment in unselected postmenopausal breast cancer patients with either weekly or biweekly im injections resulted
in 26% of patients experiencing complete or partial responses
and another 25% exhibiting disease stabilization. decreased
serum estrogen levels have been observed in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. the drug is extremely well
tolerated, and only a low percentage (13%) of patients experienced pain and/or inflammation at the injection site.
because  xxxd2153xxx  ( xxxd2153xxx ) was the
second aromatase inhibitor to be studied in patients, it is
referred to as a second-generation aromatase inhibitor.
b. third-generation aromatase inhibitors

the third-generation aromatase inhibitors include the
nonsteroidal inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole and the
steroidal inhibitor exemestane. these third-generation aromatase inhibitors have received extensive clinical evaluations (121–126).
1. anastrozole. anastrozole (arimidex; astra-zeneca, london, uk) is a potent nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in
patients, decreasing plasma estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner and producing approximately 97% inhibition of
estrogen biosynthesis at the dose of 1 mg/d (127). anastrozole was well tolerated in two large, phase iii trials of anastrozole vs.  xxxd2557xxx  in patients who progressed on
tamoxifen, and the combined analysis demonstrated a clinically significant advantage over  xxxd2557xxx  (128 –130).
two randomized, double-blind studies demonstrated that
anastrozole (1 mg daily) was more effective than tamoxifen
(20 mg daily) as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women
with advanced breast cancer (131–133). anastrozole at the
recommended therapeutic dose of 1 mg once daily effectively
suppressed total-body aromatization, with a mean percentage inhibition of 97.3%, and suppressed plasma estrone and
estradiol levels by 81– 85% in postmenopausal women with
metastatic breast cancer (134). in clinical trials with postmenopausal women, no changes were detected in levels of
androgens, an increase in the gonadotropins lh and fsh
was observed over time, and a decrease in shbg was also
detected (135).
2. letrozole. letrozole (femara; novartis, basel, switzerland)
is a potent nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor that produces
approximately 99% inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis at the
dose of 2.5 mg/d in patients (136). clinical studies, involving
postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who
have had numerous previous endocrine treatments, showed
that letrozole produced either a partial response or stabilization of disease in about 40% of the women (137, 138).

brueggemeier et al. • aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer therapy

letrozole is also well tolerated, causes a marked decrease in
serum and urine estrogen levels, and has little effect on other
endocrine factors. in clinical trials with postmenopausal
women, plasma levels of androgens were unchanged with
letrozole treatment, and increases in lh, fsh, and shbg
were detected over time (139). a multicenter, randomized,
double-blind study in advanced breast cancer reported letrozole more effective than tamoxifen in response rate, clinical
benefit, time to progression, and time to treatment failure
(140). letrozole at the recommended therapeutic dose of 2.5
mg once daily effectively suppressed total-body aromatization, with a mean percentage inhibition of greater than 99.1%,
and suppressed plasma estrone and estradiol levels by 84 –
88% in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer (141).
3. exemestane. exemestane ( xxxd2075xxx ; pfizer, new york, ny)
is a potent steroidal inhibitor of human placental aromatase,
and a single oral dose of 25 mg exemestane was found to
cause a long-lasting reduction in plasma and urinary estrogen levels. maximal suppression of circulating estrogens occurred 2–3 d after dosing and persisted for 4 –5 d (142). the
lengthy duration of estrogen suppression is thought to be
related to the irreversible nature of the drug-enzyme interaction rather than pharmacokinetic properties of the compound. exemestane is also well tolerated, causes a marked
decrease in serum and urine estrogen levels, and has no effect
on other endocrine factors (142–146). increased doses of exemestane can lead to suppression of shbg (147, 148). exemestane was shown to inhibit peripheral aromatase by 97–
98% (144, 149).
table 1 compares the inhibitory activities in vitro and in
vivo of aromatase inhibitors that have been evaluated clinically. as described earlier, anastrozole and letrozole are both
nonsteroidal competitive inhibitors of aromatase, whereas
exemestane is a mechanism-based inhibitor. investigations
of these therapeutic agents in cell lines expressing high levels
of aromatase, such as jeg-3 and jar choriocarcinoma cells,
have examined the impact of these inhibition characteristics
on the residual in vitro aromatase activity and protein levels.
several mechanism-based aromatase inhibitors produce prolonged suppression of aromatase catalytic activity for up to
48 h in cells following short drug exposure (72, 94, 150). on

the other hand, the nonsteroidal inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  resulted in elevated levels of aromatase enzyme activity
under similar conditions, possibly due to enzyme stabilization (150). in a study comparing letrozole (3 nm), exemestane
(20 nm), anastrozole (40 nm), and  xxxd147xxx  (10 nm),
aromatase activity returned to control levels immediately
after letrozole exposure and increased by about 60, 30, and
20% after 4, 24, and 48 h, respectively. after preincubation
with anastrozole or  xxxd147xxx , cellular aromatase
also increased. on the other hand, suppression of aromatase
activity was maintained for approximately 24 – 48 h after the
removal of exemestane (151). there was no increase in the
aromatase protein level in either experiment. in a study with
cultured fibroblasts from mammary adipose tissue preincubated with an antiaromatase agent for 18 h, removal of  xxxd147xxx  or anastrozole elicited up to 40% increases in
aromatase activity, whereas preincubation with exemestane
resulted in a marked suppression (152).
c. clinical studies

the third-generation aromatase inhibitors are approved in
the united states for the treatment of postmenopausal
women with metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer.
both anastrozole and letrozole were more effective than tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women with
advanced breast cancer (131–133, 153). exemestane has also
shown enhanced efficacy over tamoxifen as first-line therapy
in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer
(154). in these clinical studies, the aromatase inhibitors demonstrated improved clinical efficacy in primary endpoints of
objective response rates (complete response, partial response, or disease stabilization), time to progression, and
time to treatment failure. patients positive for  xxxg730xxx  ( xxxg730xxx  positive) and/or  xxxg1737xxx  ( xxxg1737xxx  positive) had better response
rates when treated with aromatase inhibitors than the patients treated with tamoxifen. overall, the third-generation
aromatase inhibitors are well tolerated in these clinical trials
of postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent metastatic breast cancer.
current clinical studies of aromatase inhibitors are focusing on the use of the agents in the adjuvant setting for the
treatment of early breast cancer (121, 125, 155, 156). these
studies assess the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors following tamoxifen, of aromatase inhibitors alone, and/or of
the combination of aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen in
adjuvant therapy. table 2 summarizes the key adjuvant trials
for the third-generation aromatase inhibitors. early results
from three randomized, adjuvant phase iii clinical trials have
recently been published. the largest of these trials, anastrozole, tamoxifen alone, or in combination, recruited 9366
postmenopausal women with early breast cancer, and the
patients were randomized into one of the three treatment
arms for 5 yr. after a median follow-up of 47 months, the
anastrozole arm of the study resulted in statistically significant reduction in breast cancer events and improvement of
disease-free survival (157, 158). no differences in disease-free
survival were observed between the tamoxifen-alone arm
and the combination arm. the ma-17 trial recruited 5187

data are derived from refs. 154 –160.

postmenopausal women who had taken tamoxifen for 5 yr,
and these patients were randomized into two treatment arms
of letrozole or placebo for an additional 5 yr. after a median
follow-up of 2.4 yr, the letrozole-treated patients had a significant reduction of breast cancer events (159). at this analysis, the data safety and monitoring committee for the ma-17
study recommended that the trial be halted early and the
participants informed of the positive results. the intergroup
exemestane study enrolled 4742 postmenopausal women
who had taken tamoxifen for 2 or 3 yr, and these patients
were randomized into two treatment arms of tamoxifen for
a total of 5 yr or exemestane to complete the 5-yr hormonal
therapy. exemestane therapy after 2–3 yr of tamoxifen therapy significantly reduced breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer as compared with the standard 5 yr
of tamoxifen treatment (160). based on the results of these
multiple, large randomized trials, the american society of
clinical oncology technology assessment panel (161) recommends that the “optimal adjuvant hormonal therapy for
a postmenopausal woman with receptor-positive breast cancer includes an aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after
treatment with tamoxifen.”
these multiple, large randomized trials also enabled a more
thorough analysis of the tolerability and adverse events of the
aromatase inhibitors. in general, patients receiving aromatase
inhibitors experienced less gynecological symptoms such as
endometrial cancer, vaginal bleeding, and vaginal discharges.
fewer cerebrovascular events and venous thromboembolic
events were also observed with patients receiving aromatase
inhibitors. no information is yet available on the effects of
aromatase inhibitors on serum lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease risk. on the other hand, musculoskeletal effects and bone toxicity are associated with aromatase inhibitors. the percentages of musculoskeletal effects,
which include increased arthritis, arthralgia, and/or myalgia,
were small but showed statistically significant increases with
aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen. all three aromatase inhibitors were associated with increased fractures

when compared with tamoxifen or placebo. the anastrozole,
tamoxifen alone, or in combination trial reported a 7.1% fracture incidence in the anastrozole arm vs. tamoxifen at 4.4% (157,
158). in the ma-17 study, fractures in the letrozole-treated patients were 3.6% compared with 2.9% in placebo, after 2 or 3 yr
of prior tamoxifen treatment (159). exemestane was associated
with osteoporosis and/or increased fractures (7.41%) when
compared with tamoxifen (5.7%) in the intergroup exemestane
study trial. baseline bone mineral density evaluations and potential bisphosphonate therapy are recommended (161).
other ongoing clinical studies are designed to compare the
various aromatase inhibitors and/or combination therapies
in early-stage breast cancer or in the chemoprevention setting. for example, ma-27 is a phase iii adjuvant trial in
postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer comparing exemestane with anastrozole, with or without celecoxib, a cox-2 inhibitor. the potential for aromatase inhibitors in the chemoprevention setting in women with
increased risk for the development of breast cancer is also
being considered. in preclinical models, aromatase inhibitors
reduce tumor formation in the carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumor studies (162–165). the international breast cancer intervention study ii will compare anastrozole vs. placebo in a prevention study, and the accompanying ductal
carcinoma in situ study will compare tamoxifen vs. anastrozole in women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in
situ (166). a canadian breast cancer prevention study, ncic
map3, is a three-arm study of placebo vs. exemestane vs.
exemestane and celecoxib (166). important endpoints in such
trials may include not only reduction in tumor incidence but
also may examine effects of aromatase inhibitors on bone
mineral density and serum lipid levels.

v. conclusions

aromatase inhibitors, both steroidal and nonsteroidal
agents, have been shown to be useful for the treatment of

brueggemeier et al. • aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer therapy

breast cancer. these compounds work by preventing the
synthesis of estrogens in the body. aromatase inhibitors
appear to be more effective in postmenopausal women than
in premenopausal women due to the fact that the major
source of estrogen biosynthesis in postmenopausal women
is adipose tissue. over the years, both steroidal and nonsteroidal inhibitors have developed into very potent compounds that are highly selective for aromatase vs. other steroidogenic cytochrome p450 enzymes. the potent, selective
and orally-active third-generation aromatase inhibitors,
anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, were initially approved for clinical use as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients failing antiestrogen therapy alone or multiple
hormonal therapies. more recent clinical studies have shown
that these aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast
cancer, and these agents are the approved therapy for the
treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer. furthermore, the third-generation aromatase inhibitors are now being studied in the adjuvant setting either alone or in combination with other
agents. based on the results of these multiple, large randomized trials, the american society of clinical oncology panel
recommends adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal woman with receptor-positive breast cancer with an
aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment with
tamoxifen.
