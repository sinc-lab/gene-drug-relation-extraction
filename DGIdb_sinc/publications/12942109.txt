 xxxd3297xxx  is an acetylenic retinoid which is metabolised to tazarotenic acid and which binds selectively to the retinoid receptors
 xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx . the safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral  xxxd3297xxx  were determined over 12 weeks of treatment in 34
patients with advanced cancer. commonly seen toxicities were mucocutaneous symptoms, musculoskeletal pain and headache.
dose-limiting toxicities were hypercalcaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and musculoskeletal pain. the maximum tolerated dose of
 xxxd3297xxx  in this schedule is 25.2 mg day1. plasma concentrations of tazarotenic acid were found to peak rapidly within 1 – 3 h of
dosing and thereafter declined quickly. the cmax and auc values on day 0, and weeks 2 and 4 were similar indicating no drug
accumulation. the dose-normalised cmax and auc values at different dose levels and different study days appeared to be similar
indicating linear pharmacokinetics. no objective responses were seen, although stable disease was seen in six out of eight evaluable
patients receiving the three highest dose levels of  xxxd3297xxx  (16.8, 25.2 or 33.4 mg day1). we conclude that oral  xxxd3297xxx  is well
tolerated when administered daily for 12 weeks, has a favourable toxicity profile compared with other retinoids and merits further
investigation as an anticancer therapy.

retinoids regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
in development and adult life (altucci and gronemeyer, 2001).
they also have anticancer activity in preclinical studies, acting to
promote differentiation and/or apoptosis in tumour cells and now
have an established role in the treatment of several malignancies,
including acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl), cutaneous t-cell
lymphoma and neuroblastoma (altucci and gronemeyer, 2001;
smith and anderson, 2001).
retinoids act via two families of nuclear transcription factors,
the retinoid (rara, b, g) and rexinoid ( xxxg1998xxx , b, g) receptors
(altucci and gronemeyer, 2001). these receptors act mainly as
rar – rxr heterodimers, which regulate the transcription of
downstream target genes after binding to  xxxd3417xxx  response
elements in their promoters (kastner et al, 1997). gene targeting
studies in mice indicate that the six retinoid receptors have distinct
functions; this has encouraged the development of synthetic
ligands that bind selectively to different retinoid receptors (chen
et al, 1996).
 xxxd3297xxx  (ethyl 6-[2-(4,4-dimethylthiocroman-6-yl)-ethynyl]
nicotinate) and tazarotenic acid, the free acid metabolite of
 xxxd3297xxx , belong to a novel class of retinoids called acetylenic
retinoids (chandraratna, 1996).  xxxd3297xxx  itself does not bind to
retinoid receptors, but tazarotenic acid is a retinoid agonist that
binds with high affinity to the receptors  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx 
(chandraratna, 1996).  xxxg1932xxx  expression is decreased in breast

and lung cancer compared with normal tissues suggesting that
regulation of  xxxg1932xxx  expression has a role in malignant progression
(xu et al, 1997; picard et al, 1999). in vitro studies reveal that
expression of  xxxg1932xxx  correlates with sensitivity to retinoid-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis in tumour cell lines, suggesting
that this receptor has a key role in retinoid-mediated antitumour
effects (liu et al, 1996).
preclinical studies have shown that  xxxd3297xxx  inhibits the
growth of various human tumour cell lines (leukaemia, myeloma
and cervical and breast carcinoma), head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma xenografts and human tumour explants (allergan
clinical investigator brochure –  xxxd3297xxx  ( xxxd3297xxx ),
1998). topically applied,  xxxd3297xxx  has been in clinical use for
some years and has proven effective in the treatment of psoriasis
and acne (lebwohl et al, 1998). preliminary evidence suggests
that it may possess significant activity in basal cell carcinoma
(peris et al, 1999).
in view of the evidence suggesting that  xxxd3297xxx  may have
anticancer activity, we conducted the study presented here.
the primary goals of the study were to determine the safety
profile of  xxxd3297xxx , the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) of
oral  xxxd3297xxx  when administered on a continuous daily schedule
to patients with advanced cancer and the pharmacokinetic
profile of  xxxd3297xxx  in cancer patients. patients were assessed
for evidence of tumour response or palliative benefit. as
retinoids have side effects that may only appear with prolonged
administration, patients were offered a 12-week course of daily
treatment to determine the safety of longer term  xxxd3297xxx 
administration.

 xxxd3297xxx  phase 1
ph jones et al

patient selection
patients 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed
cancer refractory to conventional therapy, who had made an
adequate recovery from side effects of all prior therapy were
candidates for this study. all patients had to have the ability to
follow study instructions. signed informed consent was obtained
prior to any study procedures. eligibility criteria also included the
following: ecog performance status 0 – 2; life expectancy greater
than 12 weeks; serum calcium p2.89 mmol 11; fasting serum
triglycerides p5.7 mmol 11; no known sensitivity to any of the
ingredients in the study medication, no prior systemic retinoid
therapy, or  xxxd3105xxx  at dosages 415 000 iu or mg day1, during
the previous year; no concurrent administration of drugs that
affect the 2c8 cytochrome p450 system such as carbamazepine; no
uncontrolled systemic disease other than cancer; no known human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infection; gastrointestinal malabsorption for any reason; and no concurrent participation in
another investigational study or participation within 30 days prior
to the start of the study. women with child-bearing potential
(women were considered as having child-bearing potential unless
they were postmenopausal, lacked a uterus and/or both ovaries, or
had undergone bilateral tubal ligation) were excluded from the
study.
patients who fulfilled the above criteria and had completed 12
weeks of treatment without evidence of disease progression or
poor compliance to treatment, and with adequate tolerance of
 xxxd3297xxx , were eligible for entry into a follow-up study, subject to
the exclusion criteria in the first part of the study and the
provision of further signed informed consent.

drug administration
 xxxd3297xxx  was supplied by allergan as soft gelatin capsules in a
liquid triglyceride vehicle containing either 0.7 or 2.1 mg
 xxxd3297xxx . the study drug was taken as a single daily dose with
breakfast. although a standard breakfast was not specified,
patients were encouraged to eat at least two slices of buttered
toast or bread and drink a glass of whole fat milk, and to continue
such a breakfast for the duration of the study. treatment
compliance was assessed by capsule counts of the returned study
drug by the pharmacist at each centre. patients who had taken
o75% of the prescribed study treatment over two consecutive
visits in either study were considered noncompliant and were
withdrawn from the study.

toxicity over a 12-week period before the next cohort of patients
was enrolled. the dose-escalation protocol, based on assessment of
toxicity at 12 weeks, was as follows. if there was no evidence of
toxicity greater than grade 1 in the first cohort, dosage was to be
escalated to 2.1 mg once daily in the second cohort. if any of the
first three patients treated at either dose level experienced dlt, an
additional three patients were treated at that dose level. an
additional dose (2.8 mg) was to be evaluated after at least three
patients in the 2.1 mg cohort had been assessed for toxicity over 12
weeks of treatment, provided mtd was not reached at the first two
dose levels.
after commencing the study, the results of an additional
toxicology study became available. this study suggested that the
mtd was likely to be significantly higher than initially projected.
the dose-escalation schedule was therefore redesigned. the second
stage of the study used an accelerated dose titration schedule
involving treatment of cohorts of one to six patients (simon et al,
1997). in the absence of toxicity greater than grade 1 in at least
three patients assessed over a 12-week period at the 2.8 mg dose
level, dosage was to be escalated by 100% for subsequent single
patients at 4-weekly rather than 12-weekly intervals. if a patient
experienced grade 2 toxicity, two additional patients were enrolled
at that dose level. at least three patients in a cohort must have been
assessable for toxicity over a 4-week period once grade 2 toxicity
was reached. if one or both of the additional patients experienced
grade 2 toxicity, the dose was subsequently escalated by 33 – 50% in
cohorts of three patients.
if one of the three patients entered at a dose level experienced
dlt, up to three additional patients were entered at that dose level.
if one of the six patients experienced dlt, dose escalation
proceeded with a dose increment of 20 – 33%, in at least three
patients per dose level. however, if a second patient in the cohort
experienced dlt, then the mtd was deemed to be exceeded. if deescalation from the dlt dose involved a 50% dose reduction to a
previously investigated dose level (e.g. from 8.4 to 4.2 mg), then a
33% dosage reduction was investigated.

dose modifications
dose reduction due to toxicity was permitted in either study if
continuation of treatment was considered appropriate for the
patient by the investigator. a period off treatment was allowed to
enable adequate recovery from all treatment-related toxicities
before restarting treatment at the reduced dose. patients were
withdrawn from the study for progressive disease, unacceptable
toxicity or if the investigators decided it was not in the patient’s
interest to continue treatment.

maximum tolerated dose

pretreatment and follow-up studies

the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) was defined as the highest
dose level at which not more than one of a cohort of three to six
patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) over a period of
12 weeks. dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any drug-related
grade 3 or 4 toxicity, or any unresolved toxicity that caused
treatment to be interrupted for more than 2 weeks.

patient histories, including performance status, concomitant
medications, physical examination and laboratory safety variables,
were measured at screening, at each treatment visit during each
study and at follow-up by the responsible local laboratories at each
centre. the initial study consisted of 11 visits scheduled at p2
weeks before baseline (screening), week 0 (baseline/start of
treatment), and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (during treatment)
and 16 (follow-up). patients in the continuation study had a
baseline visit (corresponding to week 16 of the initial study) and 10
scheduled follow-up visits at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 29, 24, 28, 32, 36
(during treatment) and 40 (follow-up). blood for biochemistry
analyses was taken after the patients had fasted for 8 h and prior to
dosing with the study drug. the following variables were assessed.
haematology: haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (mcv),
haematocrit, white blood cell count (wbc) with differential
(neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils)
and platelets. biochemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, bicarbonate, creatinine, urea, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh),

dose-escalation schedule
two dose-escalation schedules were used in the study. there was
no within-patient dose escalation in either stage of the study. at
each visit, patients were graded for toxicity according to the nci
common toxicity criteria (version 2.0).
stage 1 of the study involved dose escalation in cohorts of three
to six patients. the starting dose was 1.4 mg  xxxd3297xxx  once daily,
based on the preliminary results of a safety and pharmacokinetic
study in healthy volunteer subjects (allergan study 190168-015p).
at least three patients in this cohort had to be assessable for

semiquantitative analysis for urinary protein and glucose was also
performed. a chest x-ray and strict lateral x-ray films of the
thoracic, cervical and lumbar spine, and ankles were taken at
screening, week 12 during the initial study and at 12-weekly
intervals during the continuation study to monitor possible softtissue calcification and bone toxicity.
objective response was evaluated on the basis of tumour
measurements made by chest x-ray and other appropriate clinical
investigations (skeletal x-ray, isotopic bone or liver scan,
computer-assisted tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging
scan or abdominal ultrasound). established tumour markers that
were accepted as a measure of tumour response were also
determined. clinically measurable or evaluable lesions were
measured every 4 weeks. lesions measurable by scanning
investigations were measured every 12 weeks. response was
assessed using the uicc/eortc criteria.

tazarotenic acid data.
descriptive statistics included mean, standard deviation (s.d.),
minimal value (min), median, maximal value (max) and coefficient
of variation (cv). pharmacokinetic data analyses were performed
by the pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism department at
allergan (irvine, ca, usa).

results
pharmacokinetic analysis
 xxxd3297xxx  and tazarotenic acid concentrations were measured in
plasma samples collected before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h
postdose at baseline and weeks 2 and 4. at week 12, samples were
collected predose and 1, 2 and 3 h postdose in the first study and at
12-weekly intervals in all patients who completed at least 12
further weeks on treatment in the continuation study. on each
blood sampling day, patients were asked to take their assigned
dose of study drug with breakfast. although a standard breakfast
was not specified, patients were encouraged to eat a minimum of
two slices of buttered toast or bread and drink a glass of whole fat
milk on each occasion. blood was collected into tubes containing
ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (edta) as anticoagulant, gently
inverted to ensure adequate mixing, placed on ice for 5 min and
then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 g at 41c. plasma samples
(minimum of 4 ml) were then transferred into labelled glass
scintillation vials and stored at 151c until shipped on dry ice to
allergan, irvine, ca, usa, for analysis.  xxxd3297xxx  and tazarotenic
acid plasma concentrations were assayed using a validated liquid
chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry method (lc – ms/
ms) with a concentration range of 0.1 – 40 ng ml1 for  xxxd3297xxx 
and 0.1 – 100 ng ml1 for tazarotenic acid. the lc – ms/ms method
employed  xxxd3297xxx -d7 and tazarotenic acid-d7 as internal
standards to quantitate  xxxd3297xxx  and tazarotenic acid concentrations in human plasma. the specific precursor – product ion pairs
used in mrm analysis were: m/z 352-324 ( xxxd3297xxx ); m/z 359331 ( xxxd3297xxx -d7); m/z 324-294 (tazarotenic acid); and m/z
331-298 (tazarotenic acid-d7). the retention times of tazarotenic
acid and  xxxd3297xxx  were approximately 1.6 and 2.7 min,
respectively. the analysis was performed by allergan, inc. (irvine,
ca, usa).
for each patient, the following noncompartmental model

patient characteristics
a total of 34 patients with refractory solid tumours were treated
with  xxxd3297xxx  at eight dose levels. patient characteristics are
shown in table 1. all patients received  xxxd3297xxx  for at least 7
days, 31 patients received  xxxd3297xxx  for at least 4 weeks, 19
patients received  xxxd3297xxx  for at least 12 weeks. one patient was
on  xxxd3297xxx  for 50 weeks. the doses received by patients and
reasons for withdrawal from the study are shown in table 2.
fifteen patients discontinued from the study before 12 weeks: nine
patients were withdrawn due to disease progression, four patients
were withdrawn due to adverse events, and one patient each was
withdrawn at their own request or the investigator’s decision. five
of the 19 patients who completed the first study entered the
continuation study. the pharmacist at each study centre counted
the number of returned capsules and documented this in records
maintained at each centre. all patients were judged to have been
compliant with the study medication.
the dose of  xxxd3297xxx  was reduced in four patients during the
initial study. one patient had two dose reductions (from 33.6 to

this accelerated dose-escalation phase, the majority of toxicities
above grade 1 in severity developed after the decision to dose
escalate had been taken. table 4 lists all toxicities greater
than grade 1 and their time of onset, apart from at the highest
dose level where only grade 2/3 toxicities occurring in the first 4
weeks are listed. numerous other grade 2/3 toxicities were seen
after 4 weeks at the 33.6 mg day1 dose level, see table 3. the
latency of grade 2 toxicity was markedly shortened at the highest
dose level.
the commonest symptomatic adverse events were cutaneous
symptoms, cheilitis and dry skin (in 17 and 14 patients,
respectively). pruritus, rhinitis, oral ulceration, blocked ears, nasal
soreness and alopecia were also seen, but were not severe (grade 1
or 2). asthenia occurred in 15 patients and was severe (grade 3) in
three patients. grade 3 asthenia developed after 6 – 12 weeks of
treatment. headache and musculoskeletal side effects occurred in
seven patients, but were grade 1 or 2 in severity apart from one

adverse events
adverse events were reported for 30 of the 34 patients. the adverse
events that occurred in three or more patients are summarised in
table 3, which records the worst grade of toxicity experienced
by each patient during their time on study. also listed in table 3
are the numbers of patients at each dose level who experienced
toxicity greater than grade 1 at the time when the decision to
increase the dose of the next cohort of patients was made
(see dose-escalation schedule, above). for the three lowest
dose levels, this was after at least three patients had completed
12 weeks of treatment. for higher dose levels, this was after at
least one patient had completed 4 weeks of treatment; during

retinoids may cause skeletal toxicity after prolonged administration, resulting in ossification of ligamentous insertions (pittsley
and yoder, 1983). all patients had appropriate radiographs at 12weekly intervals to screen for this side effect but none was
detected.
the commonest biochemical abnormalities were hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, occurring at grade 1 or 2
severity in 18 and 16 patients, respectively. mild hypercalcaemia
occurred in five patients. despite small patient numbers, there
was evidence to suggest a higher prevalence of biochemical
abnormalities at the higher dose levels. hypertriglyceridaemia
occurred in four out of seven patients on 25.2 mg day1 and
five out of six patients on 33.6 mg day1, while hypercholesterolaemia was seen in four out of seven patients on 25.2 mg day1
and four out of six patients on 33.6 mg day1. severe biobritish journal of cancer (2003) 89(5), 808 – 815

patient on the 1.4 mg day1 dose level, with grade 2 hypercholesterolaemia at baseline, developed grade 4 hypercholesterolaemia
within 1 week of commencing treatment. one patient at the
highest dose level (33.6 mg day1) developed grade 3 hypercalcaemia after 4 weeks on study and a second patient at this dose level
developed grade 4 hypertriglyceridaemia after 2 weeks of

over the dose range of 1.4 – 33.6 mg used in this study, two out
of six patients developed dlt on 33.6 mg (hypercalcaemia and
hypertriglyceridaemia) and one out of six patients had dlt on
25.2 mg (musculoskeletal pain). thus, the mtd of  xxxd3297xxx  was
25.2 mg.

pharmacokinetics

tumour response was assessed in 19 of the 34 enrolled patients
who received the study drug for at least 12 weeks. all patients
had progressive disease prior to study entry. there were no
complete or partial tumour responses. nine patients had stable
disease at the 12-week assessment, in nine patients there was
disease progression and one patient was unevaluable. there were
eight evaluable patients at the highest three dose levels of whom six
had stable disease (all four patients on 33.6 mg, one of three
patients on 25.2 mg and one patient on 16.8 mg). the tumour types
of those patients who had stable disease were squamous carcinoma
of the lung, renal cell cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the
cervix, ovarian cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. this contrasts with three of 11 evaluable patients with stable
disease at the lower dose levels (melanoma, gastric cancer and
renal cell cancer). there is no evidence of clinical response from
this study.

samples were analysed for concentrations of  xxxd3297xxx  and its
active metabolite tazarotenic acid. plasma  xxxd3297xxx  concentrations were not quantifiable in most (79%, 670 out of 848 samples)
samples. the single highest plasma  xxxd3297xxx  concentration
throughout the study was 24.0 ng ml1. peak plasma tazarotenic
acid concentration was reached rapidly within 1 – 3 h of dosing and
thereafter declined quickly. representative concentration – time
curves are shown in figure 1a – f and a summary of the
pharmacokinetic parameters is given in table 5. the mean
apparent elimination half-lives on day 0 ranged from 33.3 to
15.4 h (see table 5). there was no change in the concentration –
time curves with repeated dosing (figure 1a – f). there was no
significant difference between cmax and auc values on day 0, and
weeks 2 and 4, indicating no drug accumulation or self-induction
of metabolism (data not shown). the peak tazarotenic acid
concentrations at week 12 were also similar to those on day 0

pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as mean7s.d. (minimum, median and maximum).

and weeks 2 and 4, although patient numbers were insufficient for
statistical analysis (table 5). pharmacokinetic data were available
for only a single patient following week 12, and although
significant serum levels of tazarotenic acid were detected, no
conclusions could be drawn from such limited information. the
dose-normalised (to 1 mg) cmax and auc values at different dose
levels and different study days appeared to be similar indicating
linear pharmacokinetics. there was no evidence to suggest any
differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of tazarotenic acid in
cancer patients from that found in other studies in healthy
volunteers.

discussion
a key requirement for candidate synthetic retinoids for use in
cancer treatment is an acceptable toxicity profile that enables
prolonged administration either as a single agent or in combination
with other agents such as cytotoxics or interferon (lippman et al,
1992; khuri et al, 2001). this study shows that  xxxd3297xxx  is well
tolerated up to the mtd of 25.2 mg day1 given daily for 12 weeks.
although the range of adverse events seen in this study is similar
to that reported for other retinoids, the frequency of some
symptomatic adverse events at the mtd was lower with  xxxd3297xxx .
the commonest side effects were mucocutaneous (cheilitis and dry
skin), which were experienced by the majority of patients at the
two highest dosages investigated, but which were never of greater
than grade 2 severity. similar toxicity has been reported with 9-cis
 xxxd3417xxx  (9-cis ra) and with all  xxxd3417xxx  (atra)
(lee et al, 1993; miller et al, 1996; park et al, 2000). despite the
small numbers of patients in this study, it seems that there is a
lower frequency of severe mucocutaneous toxicity with  xxxd3297xxx 
than with atra for which mucocutaneous toxicity was a dlt in
one study (park et al, 2000).
there were some differences in the adverse events in this study
compared with other retinoids. ocular toxicity (dry eyes and
conjunctivitis), which occurs in 25 – 40% of patients treated with
 xxxd2404xxx  ( xxxd2404xxx ) or atra, was only seen in one
patient in this study (lee et al, 1993; miller et al, 1996). likewise,
headache, which is frequent and may be severe and dose limiting
with 9-cis ra or atra, was reported by only seven or 34 patients
and was usually mild in severity (lee et al, 1993; miller et al, 1996).
there was no evidence of an increased frequency or greater
severity of symptomatic side effects with prolonged dosing. thus
 xxxd3297xxx  has a favourable symptomatic side effect profile
british journal of cancer (2003) 89(5), 808 – 815

compared with 9-cis ra,  xxxd2404xxx  and atra. the improved
tolerance of  xxxd3297xxx  may be due to its selective activity on  xxxg1932xxx 
and  xxxg1933xxx  receptors, in contrast to atra which is a pan rar
agonist and 9-cis ra which is a pan rar and rxr agonist (altucci
and gronemeyer, 2001).
hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia are common
toxicities with retinoids, and with  xxxd3297xxx  proved to be dose
limiting (bershad et al, 1985; lee et al, 1993; miller et al, 1996).
hypercalcaemia was also encountered in six patients, but there was
no evidence of ectopic ossification in this study. this side effect is
associated with prolonged (greater than 21 months) administration of  xxxd2404xxx  and 9-cis ra (pittsley and yoder, 1983;
lawrence et al, 2001).
 xxxd3297xxx  has ideal pharmacokinetic properties for long-term
administration. plasma concentrations of tazarotenic acid displayed linear pharmacokinetics and there was no evidence of
variation in pharmacokinetics with prolonged oral dosing. this is
in contrast to atra where a continuous oral administration is
associated with a progressive decline in plasma concentrations
with time, so that the auc is only 20% of the day 1 value by day 28
(muindi et al, 1992; smith et al, 1992). this effect appears clinically
significant and is associated with retinoid resistance and relapse in
patients with apl. a similar decline in drug concentration with
time occurs with prolonged dosing with 9-cis ra above a
threshold of 140 mg2 day1 (miller et al, 1996). the stable
pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3297xxx  is a major advantage in
cancer patients, where schedules often involve prolonged administration. in addition, there is a high level of consistency in plasma
tazarotenic acid concentrations between patients treated at the
same and different dose levels, suggesting rapid and predictable
absorption of  xxxd3297xxx  in the present formulation.
in conclusion,  xxxd3297xxx  is a selective activator of  xxxg1932xxx  and
 xxxg1933xxx . given orally over 12 weeks, it is well tolerated in cancer
patients and an ideal agent for further investigation in cancer
patients, either as a single agent or in combination with other
drugs, using a dose of 25.2 mg day1.
