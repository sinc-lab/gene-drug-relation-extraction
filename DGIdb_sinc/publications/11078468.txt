sulfonylurea sensitivity of  xxxd83xxx -sensitive potassium channels from beta cells and extrapancreatic tissues.  sulfonylureas are widely used to stimulate insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients because they close  xxxd83xxx -sensitive potassium (k(atp)) channels in the pancreatic beta-cell membrane. this action is mediated by binding of the drug to the sulfonylurea receptor ( xxxg19xxx ) subunit of the channel. k(atp) channels are also present in a range of extrapancreatic tissues, but many of these contain an alternative type of sur subunit (sur2a in heart and sur2b in smooth muscle). the sulfonylurea-sensitivity of k(atp) channels containing the different types of sur is variable:  xxxd2202xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx  block the beta cell, but not the cardiac or smooth muscle types of k(atp) channels with high affinity.  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx , on the other hand, block channels containing  xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg20xxx  with similar affinity. the reversibility of the different sulfonylureas also varies.  xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2202xxx  produce a reversible inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg20xxx  channels, whereas  xxxd2215xxx  has a reversible effect on cardiac, but not beta-cell, k(atp) channels. in this article, we summarize current knowledge of how sulfonylureas act on k(atp) channels containing the different types of sulfonylurea receptor, and discuss the implications of these findings for the use of sulfonylureas in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
