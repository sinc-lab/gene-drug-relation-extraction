the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are widely used in the
management of essential hypertension, stable chronic heart failure, myocardial
infarction (mi) and diabetic nephropathy. there is an increasing number of new
agents to add to the nine ace inhibitors (benazepril,  xxxd1694xxx , delapril, fosinopril,
lisinopril, pentopril, perindopril,  xxxd3063xxx  and ramipril) reviewed in this journal
in 1990. the pharmacokinetic properties of five newer ace inhibitors
( xxxd3409xxx , moexipril,  xxxd3237xxx ,  xxxd3305xxx  and imidapril) are reviewed in this
update.
all of these new agents are characterised by having a carboxyl functional
groups and requiring hepatic activation to form pharmacologically active metabolites. they achieve peak plasma concentrations at similar times (tmax) to those
of established agents. three of these agents ( xxxd3409xxx , moexipril and imidapril) require dosage reductions in patients with renal impairment. dosage reductions of moexipril and  xxxd3305xxx  are recommended for elderly patients, and
dosages of moexipril should be lower in patients who are hepatically impaired.
moexipril should be taken 1 hour before meals, whereas other ace inhibitors
can be taken without regard to meals.
the pharmacokinetics of warfarin are not altered by concomitant administration with  xxxd3409xxx  or moexipril. although imidapril and  xxxd3237xxx  have no
effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics, the area under the concentration-time curve
of imidapril and the peak plasma concentration of the active metabolite imidaprilat are decreased when imidapril is given together with digoxin.
although six ace inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril,
 xxxd3063xxx  and ramipril) have been approved for use in heart failure by the us
food and drug administration, an overview of 32 clinical trials of ace inhibitors
in heart failure showed that no significant heterogeneity in mortality was found
among enalapril, ramipril,  xxxd3063xxx , captopril, lisinopril, benazepril, perindopril
and  xxxd1694xxx . initiation of therapy with captopril, ramipril, and  xxxd3409xxx  at
least 3 days after an acute mi resulted in all-cause mortality risk reductions of 18
to 27%. captopril has been shown to have similar morbidity and mortality benefits to those of diuretics and beta-blockers in hypertensive patients. captopril has
been shown to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy, and enalapril and
lisinopril prevent the development of nephropathy in normoalbuminuric patients
with diabetes.
ace inhibitors are generally characterised by flat dose-response curves.
lisinopril is the only ace inhibitor that exhibits a linear dose-response curve.
despite the fact that most ace inhibitors are recommended for once-daily administration, only fosinopril, ramipril, and  xxxd3409xxx  have trough-to-peak effect ratios in excess of 50%.

the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors have been available for use in the blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
(raas) for two decades.[1] the pharmacokinetic
properties of nine of these agents have been re© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

rived from that published by kelly and o’malley,
summarises the pharmacokinetic parameters of the
older ace inhibitors.[1,3-20]
since the previous review, numerous clinical trials have established the mortality benefits of ace
inhibitors in patients with heart failure and myocardial infarction (mi).[21-33] furthermore, ace inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy and to prevent nephropathy in
normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients
with diabetes.[34-37] the information obtained from
these studies may be of critical importance in de© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

termining which agents in a large class of drugs
should be utilised in an institution.
the criteria used to validate the clinical efficacy
of antihypertensive medications have been modified over the past decade.[38] consequently, an understanding of selective pharmacodynamic properties,
including trough-to-peak ratios and dose-response
effects, will enable clinicians to select the optimal
ace inhibitor for treating patients with hypertension.
in the present review, we have focused upon reviewing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

properties of newer agents and included information on the effects of age and disease on the pharmacokinetics of these agents. we also have reviewed landmark clinical trials, dose-response effects
and trough-to-peak ratios for every agent with evaluable data.
1. angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibition
the raas is a critical component in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte balance and
fluid volume homeostasis.[39,40] renin release from
the juxtaglomerular cells located in the renal afferent arterioles initiates the raas cascade. renin, a
340-amino-acid glycoprotein, is synthesised and
stored in juxtaglomerular cells.[41] following its release, renin cleaves the decapeptide  xxxg99xxx 
from the circulating glycoprotein  xxxg99xxx .
ace cleaves a dipeptide sequence from  xxxg99xxx  to yield the octapeptide  xxxg99xxx .[41]
 xxxg99xxx  exerts its physiological actions
at numerous sites in the body, including vascular
smooth muscle, adrenal cortex, kidney and
brain.[42] consequently,  xxxg99xxx  is a key regulator of blood pressure and extracellular volume.
briefly,  xxxg99xxx –mediated vasoconstriction
of the efferent arterioles and increased epinephrine
release from the adrenal medulla both contribute to
elevating blood pressure.  xxxg99xxx  controls
intravascular volume by promoting the synthesis
and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex,
which increases proximal tubular sodium reabsorption.[42] other effects include thirst stimulation, decreased renin secretion, increased  xxxd3495xxx  secretion from the central nervous
system, and mitogenesis of cardiac and vascular
muscle cells.[42]
over the past two decades, numerous studies
have been conducted to determine the relationship
between plasma or tissue ace inhibition and the
antihypertensive efficacy of ace inhibitors.[43-46]

was previously reviewed by kelly and o’malley in
this journal.[1] since the majority of ace inhibition
studies utilised different techniques for measuring
ace activity, cross comparisons of the relationships between ace inhibition and antihypertensive
efficacy for ace inhibitors is fraught with difficulty.[47]
studies with moexipril,  xxxd3409xxx  and imidapril have generally demonstrated a lack of
correlation between the blood pressure lowering
effects of these agents and the extent of ace
inhibition. [43-45] in spontaneously hypertensive
rats, although moexipril was a more potent blocker
of ace in lungs, aorta, and heart than enalapril, both
agents lowered blood pressure to a comparable extent.[43] although low doses (3 to 300 mug/kg) of
 xxxd3409xxx  administered to sprague-dawley
rats induced complete ace inhibition in serum,
heart ventricle, renal inner cortex, lung, aorta,
adrenal cortex and medulla, only higher doses (>3
mg/kg) were able to significantly lower blood pressure.[44] single doses of imidapril 2.5 and 5mg
given to 24 patients with new york heart association class ii/iii heart failure showed no difference in the degree of serum ace inhibition
between the 2 doses. [45] in contrast, only the 5mg
dose lowered diastolic blood pressure significantly.
 xxxd3305xxx  doses ranging from 2.5 to 40mg
were administered to ten healthy males in a study
performed by delacretaz et al.[46] plasma ace activity was estimated by calculating the ratio of  xxxg99xxx  to  xxxg99xxx . in vivo ace activity
was shown to be correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to exogenous  xxxg99xxx  administration (r = 0.76 and r = 0.70,
respectively). therefore, unlike moexipril,  xxxd3409xxx  and imidapril, the antihypertensive effect
of  xxxd3305xxx  appears to be correlated with the extent of ace inhibition. imidapril also displays
concentration-dependent ace inhibition.[48] there
is one study which showed that  xxxd3305xxx  is a
competitive ace i n hibitor.[49] trandolaprilat exclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

hibits competitive ace inhibition.[50]  xxxd3237xxx 
was found to exhibit noncompetitive ace inihibition in one study.[51] moexipril exhibited concentration-dependent ace inhibition in a study.[52]therefore, only  xxxd3237xxx  appears to exhibit noncompetitive
ace inhibition among the newer ace inhibitors.
2.  xxxd3409xxx 
 xxxd3409xxx  is a monoacid-monoester prodrug
structurally related to enalapril.[53-55] following
hydrolysis in the liver,  xxxd3409xxx  is converted to
the active metabolite trandolaprilat, a dicarboxylic
acid.
2.1 pharmacokinetic properties

the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3409xxx 
and trandolaprilat have been determined in healthy
volunteers,[56] patients with renal impairment[57]
and patients with mild to moderate hypertension.[54] lenfant and colleagues examined the
pharmacokinetics of oral  xxxd3409xxx  0.5 to 4mg
administered as a single-dose to 12 healthy male
volunteers (see table ii).[56] following oral admin-

istration, peak plasma concentrations (cmax) for
 xxxd3409xxx  and trandolaprilat occurred at 0.5 and
6 hours, respectively. plasma concentrations of
 xxxd3409xxx  and trandolaprilat were quantified by
radioimmunoassay. the cmax was shown to be directly proportional to the dose (linear kinetics) and
ranged from 0.43 to 3.32 mug/l for 0.5 to 4mg. similarly, the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (auc) expanded with increasing doses in a linear fashion, and ranged from 0.4 to 3.64 mug • h/l for
0.5 to 4mg for the parent drug. the mean half-life of
 xxxd3409xxx  was 0.72 hour. the cmax and auc from 0
to 24 hours (auc24) for trandolaprilat ranged from
0.96 to 6.41 mug/l and 17.99 to 73.72 mug • h/l, respectively. the renal clearance (clr) of trandolaprilat
calculated over 0 to 24 hours ranged from 0.34 to
6.66 l/h.
2.2 effects of renal impairment

 xxxd3409xxx  2mg was administered daily for 10
days to 8 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with

group 1, clcr 7 to 30 ml/min; group 2, clcr 31 to
80 ml/min; and group 3, clcr >80 ml/min (normal).
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3409xxx  were virtually unchanged in renal impairment. in contrast,
for trandolaprilat, the c max and auc 24 of individuals whose clcr was less than 30 ml/min were
approximately double those of healthy individuals
on day 1 (p = 0.012 for both cmax and auc) and on
day 10 (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0007, respectively).
danielson and colleagues concluded that the dosage
of  xxxd3409xxx  should be reduced in patients with
clcr <30 ml/min.
2.3 effects of age

arner and colleagues compared the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3409xxx  and trandolaprilat in 14 elderly patients (>65 years) and 10 patients under 65
years of age, all with mild to moderate hypertension.[54]  xxxd3409xxx  2mg was administered oncedaily for 10 days to both groups. the time to peak
plasma concentration (tmax) was observed significantly earlier on days 1 and 10 in elderly patients and
the day 10 auc was higher (by 65%, p = 0.016) in
the older group. trandolaprilat pharmacokinetic
properties were unaltered by age. in addition, it was
shown that  xxxd3409xxx  induced comparable reductions in diastolic blood pressures in both groups.
arner et al.[54] summarised their study by suggesting
that elderly patients do not require dosage modification of  xxxd3409xxx .
2.4 drug interactions

a two-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled
crossover study performed by meyer et al.[65] evaluated the effect of  xxxd3409xxx  on warfarin pharmacokinetics.  xxxd3409xxx  2mg or placebo was administered once-daily to 19 healthy male volunteers.
on the eighth day of treatment, volunteers received a single oral dose of warfarin 25mg. the
area under the prothrombin time (pt) versus time
curve (0 to 144h) and the auc144 for clotting factor
vii did not differ between placebo and  xxxd3409xxx .

pritchard et al.[66] showed that indomethacin did
not attenuate the blood pressure lowering effects of
 xxxd3409xxx  2mg given orally once-daily to 17 patients with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure
95 to 115mm hg). the addition of indomethacin
25mg twice daily did not result in significant increases in blood pressure; diastolic and systolic
blood pressure increased by 1.6mm hg (p = 0.87)
and 2.2mm hg (p = 0.79), respectively, after 3 weeks.
3. moexipril
moexipril is a carboxylic acid derivative that is
hydrolysed to its active metabolite, moexiprilat,
following oral administration.[58]
3.1 pharmacokinetic properties

the pharmacokinetic properties of moexipril
and moexiprilat have been examined in healthy
volunteers and patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction.[58] following single oral doses of moexipril
3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30mg taken by 24 healthy volunteers, maximum moexipril plasma concentrations
(approximately 25 to 170 mug/l) were shown to increase in a dose-linear fashion and occurred within
1.5 to 2.1 hours. cmax values for moexiprilat were
also shown to be dose-linear and ranged from about
2.5 to 40 mug/l for 3.75 to 30mg.
the effect of food on the bioavailability of oral
moexipril has been studied in healthy volunteers.
stimpel et al.[59] conducted a non-blind, randomised,
crossover study with a 2-week washout period in
which 24 men aged 18 to 40 years were administered moexipril 15mg in the  xxxd2476xxx  fasting
or 30 minutes after a standard breakfast. the bioavailability was reduced by 40% after ingestion of
a standard breakfast (p-value not specified). consequently, the manufacturer recommends that
moexipril should be taken 1 hour before meals.
moexipril excretion was characterised in a
study with four healthy volunteers who received a
single oral dose of moexipril 15mg followed by a
single 5mg intravenous dose 3 weeks later.[58] after
intravenous administration, 40% of the dose was

recovered in urine as moexiprilat, 26% of the dose
appeared in urine as moexipril, and 20% of the
dose appeared in faeces primarily as moexiprilat.
after oral administration, faecal recovery rates of
moexiprilat and moexipril were 52 and 1%, while
urinary recovery rates were 7 and 1%, respectively.

213

respectively, in the hepatically impaired group (pvalue not specified). the results of this study
prompted the manufacturer to recommend a starting dose of 3.75mg for patients with hepatic failure.
3.5 drug interactions

3.2 effects of renal impairment

moexipril 15mg was administered to 21 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment in
a non-blind study.[58] patients with clcr in the
range of 10 to 40 ml/min experienced a 3- to 4-fold
increase in the half-life of moexiprilat. therefore,
for patients with clcr ≤40 ml/min/1.73m2, the manufacturer recommends a starting dosage of 3.75mg
once daily and to avoid exceeding a maximum dosage of 15 mg/day.
3.3 effects of age

the pharmacokinetics of moexipril was compared in 12 healthy elderly (65 to 80 years) and 12
healthy young (18 to 39 years) men.[58] moexipril
15mg was administered once-daily for 5 days to
both groups. after 5 days, the auc of moexiprilat
was 30% higher in the elderly group (p-value not
specified). however, neither group exhibited significant drug accumulation after five doses of
moexipril. hence, no specific dosage modification
for elderly patients has been suggested by the manufacturer, except to initiate therapy with a low
starting dosage.
3.4 effects of hepatic disease

the effect of hepatic disease on moexipril pharmacokinetics was examined in an non-blind study
with 12 patients aged 35 to 66 years with mild to
moderate liver cirrhosis who were given a singledose of moexipril 15mg.[58] compared with the control group of healthy volunteers (18 to 39 years), the
hepatically impaired group showed a 50% and
100% increase in moexipril cmax and auc, respectively (p-value not specified). the moexiprilat
cmax and auc were 50% lower and 30% greater,
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

single oral doses of moexipril 30mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg were administered alone or in
combination to 12 healthy male volunteers.[67] no
significant changes in the auc12, cmax and mean
total renal excretion of moexipril and moexiprilat
occurred with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide.
van hecken et al.[68] examined the pharmacokinetic interactions between warfarin and moexipril.
ten healthy men received a single oral dose of warfarin 50mg on day 1 of 6 days of oral moexipril
15mg once daily. total body clearance (cl), volume of distribution (vd), tmax, cmax and the auc120
of (r)-warfarin and (s)-warfarin were not significantly affected. in addition, the maximum pt and
the area under the pt versus time curve (0 to 168h)
were not altered by moexipril.
4.  xxxd3237xxx 
 xxxd3237xxx  has structural similarities to perindopril, fosinopril and  xxxd1694xxx .[60] following hydrolysis, the parent drug is converted to the active
diacid metabolite, spiraprilat.
4.1 pharmacokinetic properties

the pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd3237xxx 
have been determined in healthy volunteers, [60] patients with mild to moderate hypertension and
varying degrees of renal dysfunction,[61] and patients with hepatic disease.[60] grass and colleagues examined the pharmacokinetics of oral and
intravenous  xxxd3237xxx  6mg administered as a singledose to 12 healthy male volunteers.[60] following
intravenous administration, cmax for  xxxd3237xxx  and
spiraprilat occurred within 0.4 and 1.5 hours, respectively. the cmax of  xxxd3237xxx  and spiraprilat
were quantified by radioimmunoassay and were

193 and 45 mug/l, respectively. the total plasma
clearance (clp) of  xxxd3237xxx  was shown to be 56 l/h,
of which clr accounted for 11 l/h. for spiraprilat,
clp and clr were 18.7 and 3.0 l/h, respectively. vd
for  xxxd3237xxx  was 28l and the elimination halflife (t1⁄2beta) ranged from 20 to 50 minutes. the t1⁄2beta
of spiraprilat was approximately 41 hours.
following oral administration of  xxxd3237xxx  6mg,
cmax for  xxxd3237xxx  and spiraprilat occurred at 1.0
and 2.4 hours, respectively, with values of 20 and
23 mug/l, respectively. clp for  xxxd3237xxx  (118 l/h)
was nearly 5-fold greater than that of spiraprilat
(24 l/h). cl r was similar between the two moieties, at 3.3 and 3.0 l/h for  xxxd3237xxx  and spiraprilat, respectively. the values of t1⁄2beta for  xxxd3237xxx 
and spiraprilat were 60 to 97 minutes and 33
hours, respectively.
 xxxd3237xxx  exhibits linear kinetics at doses ranging
from 6 to 50mg.[60] the cmax and auc increased
linearly with increasing single doses and ranged from
68 to 634 mug/l and 453 to 2385 mug • h/l, respectively, for 6 to 50mg. interestingly, the plasma
concentration-time profile of spiraprilat was characterised by nonlinear and linear phases. the area
under the alpha phase of the plasma concentrationtime profile represented the linear phase and the
area under the terminal phase of the profile reflected the nonlinear phase. the accumulation
ratio of  xxxd3237xxx  was unchanged, and that for
spiraprilat increased 1.2 to 1.4-fold, after 2
weeks of treatment with once-daily oral  xxxd3237xxx 
6 and 24mg.[60] the bioavailability of  xxxd3237xxx  and
its active diacid metabolite is 50%.[62] approximately 42% of the total ingested oral dose is converted to spiraprilat (84% of the total bioavailable
drug).[61,62]
4.2 effects of renal impairment

stein et al.[61] evaluated  xxxd3237xxx  pharmacokinetics in 49 patients with mild to moderate hypertension and varying degrees of renal impairment.
following a 2-week placebo run-in phase, patients were administered oral  xxxd3237xxx  6mg once

song & white

daily for 4 weeks. the patients were divided into
four groups according to renal function: group 1,
clcr >80 ml/min; group 2, clcr 41 to 80 ml/min;
group 3, clcr 20 to 40 ml/min; and group 4, clcr
<20 ml/min. after 4 weeks of treatment, there
were no differences in  xxxd3237xxx  auc, c max, cl,
t max or t 1⁄2beta between the four groups. in contrast,
for spiraprilat, auc and t1⁄2beta increased by approximately 4- and 3-fold, respectively. the authors
commented that trough plasma concentrations (24
hours post-dose) of  xxxd3237xxx  increased only
slightly with decreasing clcr, so clinically relevant accumulation of  xxxd3237xxx  is unlikely in patients with clcr < 20 ml/min. despite the significant increases in spiraprilat auc seen in patients
with renal impairment, no clinically significant accumulation of the active diacid metabolite occurred. the manufacturer recommends reducing
the initial dosage by 50%, whereas other reviewers
of this drug have recommended no dosage adjustment.[69] therefore, it remains unclear as to
whether the  xxxd3237xxx  dosage should be reduced in
patients with renal impairment
4.3 effects of age

the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd3237xxx  has been studied with single doses of 3 to
6mg and 25mg .[60] in one study,  xxxd3237xxx  was administered as a single 25mg dose to 24 patients
with a mean age of 69.5 years.[60] in another study,
 xxxd3237xxx  3 to 6mg was given to 32 elderly patients
(age not specified) as a single-dose.[60] the cmax
and auc increased by 30% in both elderly study
populations for both  xxxd3237xxx  and spiraprilat compared with 53 healthy young volunteers with a
mean age of 30.2 years (p-value not specified).
since the elevations in cmax and auc were doseindependent, no specific dosage adjustment for age
has been recommended by the manufacturer.
4.4 effects of hepatic disease

 xxxd3237xxx  was administered as a single 25mg
dose to 18 hepatically impaired patients.[60]
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

new ace inhibitors

 xxxd3237xxx  pharmacokinetic parameters were unchanged relative to those observed in 16 healthy
young volunteers. the cmax and auc of spiraprilat
were around 30% lower in patients with hepatic
disease compared with healthy young volunteers
(p-value not specified). the clp of  xxxd3237xxx  given
as a 4mg intravenous dose was 10.2l/h, of which
clr accounted for 7.8l/h. whether or not these
changes are clinically relevant requires further
study.
4.5 drug interactions

johnson et al. evaluated the effect of multiple
doses of  xxxd3237xxx  on steady-state digoxin pharmacokinetics in 15 healthy male volunteers.[70] digoxin was given orally as 0.25mg twice daily for 5
weeks, with  xxxd3237xxx  or placebo added during weeks
1 and 2, or weeks 4 and 5.  xxxd3237xxx  was titrated from
12 to 48mg once daily over a 1-week period.  xxxd3237xxx  did not affect the cmax, tmax, auc12, clr,
mean steady-state concentration or extent of urinary
excretion of digoxin.
5.  xxxd3305xxx 
 xxxd3305xxx  is a prodrug, carboxylic acid type of
ace inhibitor that is converted to its pharmacologically active diacid metabolite, temocaprilat, by
liver and gut mucosa esterases.[63]
5.1 pharmacokinetic properties

the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3305xxx 
and temocaprilat have been determined in healthy
volunteers,[71] young and elderly patients with hypertension,[63] and patients with hypertension with varying degrees of renal impairment.[72] puchler et al.[63]
performed a non-blind study that evaluated the
pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd3305xxx  20mg
administered as a single-dose and after seven oncedaily doses to 18 (≤40 years) patients with hypertension. plasma  xxxd3305xxx  and temocaprilat concentrations were quantified using capillary gas
chromatography-negative ion chemical ionisation
mass spectrometry.  xxxd3305xxx  pharmacokinetic

properties were shown to be similar after single
and multiple doses. the tmax occurred within 1 hour
and cmax was 139 mug/l at steady state (1 week).
the steady-state auc and t1⁄2beta were 140 mug • h/l
and 1.6 hours, respectively. the steady-state cl and
clr were 132 and 2.75 l/h, respectively.
the tmax of temocaprilat occurred within 1.5
hours following single and multiple doses of  xxxd3305xxx  20mg, and the cmax values were 760 and
828 mug/l, respectively. the steady-state auc24,
t1⁄2beta and clr for temocaprilat were 3457 mug • h/l,
19.4h and 1.35 l/h, respectively.
5.2 effects of renal impairment

the effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3305xxx  and temocaprilat have
been evaluated in a single-dose study with  xxxd3305xxx  20mg and in a multiple-dose study with
 xxxd3305xxx  10mg. sierakowski et al.[71] conducted
a study in which 29 individuals were divided into
four groups according to their quartiles of renal
function: clcr ≥60 ml/min, 40 to 59 ml/min, 20 to
39 ml/min and <20 ml/min. following a singledose of  xxxd3305xxx  20mg, both the cmax and t max
of  xxxd3305xxx  and temocaprilat were shown to be
unaffected by decreases in cl cr. although the
auc of  xxxd3305xxx  was independent of changes
in clcr, the auc of temocaprilat increased by
2 to 3-fold with progressive renal impairment (pvalue not specified). in addition, the t1⁄2beta of temocaprilat in individuals with clcr <60 ml/min
was prolonged compared with that in healthy controls (p-value not specified). however, the magnitude of the increases in auc and t 1⁄2beta did not
parallel the decreases in mean clr for  xxxd3305xxx 
and temocaprilat, which decreased by approximately 10-fold for both entities. the investigators
concluded that since  xxxd3305xxx  had been shown in
a previous human study to be predominantly excreted in the faeces,[73] a compensatory increase in
biliary excretion may occur in response to renal
impairment.
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

216

similar results were obtained in a multiple-dose
study performed by puchler et al.,[72] in which the
study protocol employed was almost identical to
that used by sierakowski et al.[71] however, instead
of giving patients a single 20mg dose,  xxxd3305xxx 
10mg was administered once-daily for 2 weeks to
32 volunteers with varying degrees of renal impairment.
in summary, despite the evidence suggesting dual
elimination of  xxxd3305xxx , sierakowski et al.[71] and
puchler et al.[72] concluded that the dosage of  xxxd3305xxx  should be reduced for patients with moderate
to severe renal impairment.
5.3 effects of age

puchler et al.[63] determined the pharmacokinetic
properties of  xxxd3305xxx  20mg administered as a
single-dose and as seven once-daily doses to 18 elderly (≥65 years) and 18 young (≤40 years) patients
with hypertension. there were no differences in  xxxd3305xxx  cmax, tmax, auc, t1⁄2beta and cl after a singledose and at steady-state (7 days). the clr (singledose and steady-state) of  xxxd3305xxx  was 60% lower
in elderly patients than in younger patients (p < 0.05).
after a single-dose of  xxxd3305xxx  20mg, the auc
and clr of temocaprilat were 50% higher (p < 0.05)
and 38% lower (p < 0.05), respectively, in the elderly
group. at steady-state, the auc and clr of temocaprilat were 36% higher and 35% lower, respectively, in the elderly group (p < 0.05). puchler and
associates concluded that lower initial doses
should be used in elderly patients with hypertension in order to minimise the risk of hypotension.
6. imidapril
imidapril is a carboxylic acid prodrug that
undergoes hydrolysis in the liver to form its active
metabolite imidaprilat.[64,74]

mild to moderate hypertension.[64] in a nonrandomised, non-blind study, harder and colleagues
examined the pharmacokinetics of oral imidapril
administered once-daily as single and multiple
doses[28] to 10 patients with hypertension (3 males
and 7 females aged 37 to 72 years).[64] plasma concentrations of imidapril and imidaprilat were quantified by monoclonal antibody radioimmunoassay.
following a single-dose, the c max of imidapril
(39.3 ± 10.1 mug/l) and imidaprilat (15.7 ± 9.8
mug/l) occurred 2 and 7 hours post-dose, respectively. the auc24 of imidapril and imidaprilat
were 140 ± 43 and 211 ± 101 mug • h/l, respectively. the t1⁄2beta of imidapril was 1.8 ± 0.9 hours
and that of imidaprilat was considerably longer,
approaching 8 hours.
after 4 weeks of treatment, imidapril cmax and
tmax did not change significantly from day 1 and
were 34.7 ± 12.3 mug/l and 2 hours, respectively.
the cmax of imidaprilat at steady-state was 20.4 ±
5.2 mug/l and occurred 5 hours post-dose. the
auc24 of imidapril and imidaprilat were 123 ± 34
and 240 ± 55 mug • h/l, respectively. the cmax and tmax
observed for imidaprilat at steady-state did not differ
significantly from day 1 values.
6.2 effects of renal impairment

the disposition of imidapril and imidaprilat in
patients with chronic renal failure was studied by
hoogkamer and associates.[48] twenty-four volunteers were divided into three groups according to their
renal function, which was represented by clcr.
group 1 consisted of eight healthy individuals (mean
age 53 years) with a mean clcr of 116 ml/min. the
remaining 16 individuals (mean age 58 years) were
equally distributed into groups 2 and 3, and the mean
clcr of the two groups were 64 and 18 ml/min, respectively. following a single oral dose of imidapril
10mg, the cmax and auc∞ of imidapril in group 3
were 3-fold greater than those in group 1 (p < 0.05).
the cmax and auc∞ of imidaprilat in group 3 were
6- and 12-fold greater than those in group 1, respectively (p < 0.05).
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

new ace inhibitors

after seven once-daily doses of imidapril 10mg,
the differences in the cmax and auc∞ of imidapril
between groups 1 and 3 were similar to those seen
after one dose. the cmax and auc∞ of imidaprilat
in group 3 were 3- to 4-fold and 6-fold greater than
the corresponding group 1 parameters, respectively (p < 0.05). hoogkamer and colleagues concluded that minimum clinically effective doses
should be given to patients with clcr <25 ml/min.
6.3 effects of hepatic disease

the effects of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of imidapril and imidaprilat were examined by hoogkamer et al.[75] in an non-blind study
with 16 patients who were given once-daily single
and multiple (seven) doses of oral imidapril 10mg.
eight patients with normal liver function and a mean
age of 43 years were assigned to group 1. group 2
consisted of eight patients (mean age 55 years) of
whom two and six, respectively, were diagnosed
with grade a child-pugh classification cirrhosis
and fatty liver disease. there were no significant
differences in cmax, tmax, auc or t1⁄2beta between the
two groups after one dose or seven doses, except
for the cmax of imidaprilat on day 1, which was
2-fold lower in group 2 (p < 0.05). hence, hoogkamer and associates concluded that patients with hepatic disease do not require dosage modification of
imidapril.
6.4 drug interactions

harder et al. evaluated the pharmacokinetic interaction between imidapril and digoxin in 12
healthy male volunteers.[76] the volunteers each
received 8 days of treatment with digoxin 0.25mg
once daily given with placebo or with imidapril
10mg once daily, or imidapril 10mg once daily
with placebo. concurrent administration of imidapril and digoxin decreased the cmax of imidaprilat
by 20% [90% confidence interval (ci) 0.67 to 1.00,
point estimate (pe) 0.82] and the auc24 of imidapril
by 19% (90% ci 0.76 to 0.94, pe 0.85). in contrast,
neither the cmax nor the auc24 of digoxin were

altered by concomitant administration with imidapril.
7. landmark clinical trials
numerous clinical trials have established the effectiveness of ace inhibitors in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, mi and diabetic nephropathy.[21-34,77-80] the sixth report of
the joint national committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood
pressure (jnc-vi) recommended ace inhibitors
as first-line therapeutic agents for patients with
type 1 diabetes mellitus with proteinuria, mi patients with evidence of systolic dysfunction, and
patients with heart failure.[77] shortly after the
jnc-vi guidelines were published, the results of
the captopril prevention project (cappp) were
reported.[78] patients were randomised to receive
diuretics and beta-blockers (n = 5493), agents previously shown to have mortality benefit, or captopril (n = 5492) for 5 years. the number of patients
who achieved the primary endpoint of fatal and
nonfatal mi, stroke and other cardiovascular
deaths did not differ between the two treatment
groups (p = 0.52).
currently, ace inhibitors are considered firstline therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients
with stable chronic heart failure. numerous clinical trials have established that these agents reduce
all-cause mortality and the combined risk of death
and hospitalisation.[21-25,79] six ace inhibitors
(captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril,  xxxd3063xxx 
and ramipril) have been approved for use in heart
failure by the us food and drug administration
(fda).[80] a 1995 overview of 32 clinical trials of
ace inhibitors in heart failure showed that no significant heterogeneity in mortality was found
among enalapril, ramipril,  xxxd3063xxx , captopril,
lisinopril, benazepril, perindopril and  xxxd1694xxx .[24]
the overall odds ratio for these agents was 0.77, with
a 95% confidence interval of 0.67 to 0.88 (p < 0.001).

patients by the fda.[80] large clinical trials have
demonstrated the ability of captopril, lisinopril,
ramipril and  xxxd3409xxx  to reduce overall mortality.[26-33] a 100 000-patient overview of the fourth
international study of infarct survival (isis-4), chinese cardiac study (ccs-1), cooperative new scandinavian enalapril survival study ii (consensus
ii), and third gruppo italiano per lo studio della
sopravvivenza nell’infarto miocardico (gissi-3) trials was published in 1998.[30] a7% reduction in overall mortality occurred with ace inhibitors compared
with placebo (7.11% mortality with ace inhibitors
and 7.59% with placebo, p < 0.004). ace inhibitor
therapy was initiated within 36 hours after the onset
of chest pain in these trials.[80] the survival and ventricular enlargement (save), acute infarction
ramipril efficacy (aire) and  xxxd3409xxx  cardiac evaluation (trace) trials assessed the mortality benefits of starting ace inhibitor therapy
(captopril, ramipril and  xxxd3409xxx , respectively)
at least 3 days after an acute mi.[31-33] the all-cause
mortality risk reductions observed in the three trials
ranged from 18 to 27% (p < 0.019, 0.002 and 0.001,
respectively).
ace inhibitors have also been shown to delay
the progression of diabetic nephropathy[34] and to
prevent nephropathy in normoalbuminuric and
microalbuminuric patients with diabetes.[35-37] in a
study in patients with type 1 diabetes, captopril
therapy was associated with a 50% risk reduction
in achieving the combined secondary endpoints of
death, dialysis and transplantation (p = 0.02).[34]
enalapril and lisinopril therapy has been shown to
prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy in
normoalbuminuric diabetic patients.[35,36] patients
treated with enalapril and lisinopril exhibited lower albumin excretion rates (measure of glomerular permeability) compared with placebo (p = 0.001 and p < 0.03,
respectively). furthermore, long term (up to 7 years)
enalapril treatment of patients with microalbuminuric type 2 diabetes with has been demonstrated
to preserve renal function.[37] patients who received enalapril for a longer time period were more

likely to experience decreases in their serum creatinine.
recently, the use of ramipril was expanded to
include patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease, with no signs of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.[81] the heart outcomes prevention evaluation (hope) trial was terminated early
after an interim analysis showed compelling evidence of a beneficial effect of ramipril.[81] ramipril
therapy was associated with a 22% risk reduction
in the primary outcome of cardiovascular death, mi
or stroke compared with placebo (p < 0.001). for
a more comprehensive review of clinical trials with
ace inhibitors, readers should refer to the reviews
written by white[80] (for mi and heart failure) and
manley[82] (for renal disease).
8. dose-response
over the past decade, the fda division of cardio-renal drug products has developed a standardised set of guidelines designed to optimise the
use of antihypertensive drugs.[38] particular attention has been focused on the dose-response relationships of antihypertensive drugs. earlier doseranging studies with captopril, the first ace
inhibitor to be marketed worldwide, reported a
large number of adverse events.[83] these events
were attributed to the use of both excessive dosages
and short intervals between dosage adjustments.
furthermore, an understanding of the dose-response
effects of ace inhibitors can also provide an indication of when additive therapy for hypertension
rather than dosage escalation is warranted.
the delineation of dose-response relationships
with respect to the antihypertensive efficacy of
ace inhibitors has been challenging. this is due,
in part, to the lack of uniformity in the study designs of various dose-response trials with ace
inhibitors. [83] in particular, the duration of the
active drug treatment phase, the range of doses
used, and the number of individuals enrolled in
the studies differed considerably. an optimal doseresponse study should provide a sufficiently wide
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (3)

new ace inhibitors

range of doses such that the lower, middle and upper segments of the dose-response curve will
emerge upon study completion.[38] specifically, the
minimum dose required to exert superior blood
pressure lowering effects compared with placebo, the dose that produces half-maximal effect
and the dose that elicits no further reductions in
blood pressure should be included. in general,
blood pressure differences exceeding 2mm hg delineate clinically significant differences in antihypertensive effect.[84] also, since ace inhibitors generally require several weeks to achieve maximum
effect, the duration of the active treatment phase
should be at least 4 weeks.[38,83] acceptable study
designs include randomised studies, parallel doseresponse studies, titration studies and crossover
studies.[38] in addition, since the dose ranges of
most ace inhibitors are usually validated by only
one or two well-controlled studies, a minimum of
30 to 40 patients per dose level is recommended.[38]
finally, dose-response studies should report mean
reductions in blood pressure rather than percentage
responses.
dose-response studies performed over the past
two decades shared some common features.[85-91]
with few exceptions, most studies included patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, whose diastolic blood pressures (dbps) usually ranged from 95mm hg to 115mm hg following
a 4-week, single-blind, placebo treatment period.
also, participants were mostly caucasian (75 to
100%), with mean ages of approximately 50 years.
in addition, blood pressure measurements were
generally performed immediately prior to ingestion of the active drug or placebo. table iii summarises the major dose-response studies performed with various ace inhibitors.
the dose-response studies with ramipril,
 xxxd3063xxx , benazepril and  xxxd3409xxx  have yielded
inconclusive results.[53,83,92-95] ramipril[83] and
 xxxd3063xxx [83,92] studies have either included an insufficient number of patients or used overly narrow
dose ranges. most of the dose-ranging studies of

benazepril have only been published as abstracts
or have included a small number of patients.[93-95]
similarly,  xxxd3409xxx  dose-ranging studies have
been of short duration (8 days) or have been published only in abstract form.[53]
in summary, with the exception of lisinopril,
most of the commercially available ace inhibitors
are characterised by flat dose-response curves.
maximal efficacy usually is achieved with doses in
the lower to middle portion of the recommended
range.
9. trough-to-peak ratios
in recent years, the fda has revised the way it
has evaluated the efficacy of antihypertensive
medications.[96] previously, efficacy trials generally reported the sitting dbp at trough (time immediately prior to next dose) as the study endpoint.
therefore, larger doses of the drugs were used in
order to yield clinically relevant blood pressure reductions with once-daily administration.[42,96]
however, the risk of excessive peak reductions in
blood pressure was increased by the attempts to
retain significant decreases in blood pressure at the
end of the administration interval. consequently,
the fda recommended that the placebo-corrected
trough effect of an antihypertensive agent should
be at least one-half of the placebo-corrected peak
effect.[96] also, if the net reduction in blood pressure induced by an agent is below 5mm hg at peak,
the trough-to-peak (t:p) ratio should be at least
67%.[96]
after the fda guidelines were released, numerous studies evaluating the t:p ratios of several
ace inhibitors were conducted.[97] unfortunately,
the methods used to measure the t:p ratios varied
considerably among the studies, thus limiting the
cross-comparability of the results.[97] to date, the
two commonly used methods are the global and
individual techniques; most studies have utilised
the global method to perform t:p ratio measurements.[98]

with the global method, the subject’s blood
pressure is determined by 24-hour ambulatory
blood pressure recording.[98] initially, on day 1 of
the single-blind, placebo treatment washout phase,
the 1-hour blood pressure means of all subjects are
calculated and then averaged throughout the 24hour period. next, at the end of the washout phase
(usually 4 weeks), the 1-hour blood pressure means
from day 1 are subtracted from the corresponding
values at follow-up. at the end of the active treatment phase, 1-hour net treatment effects are calculated by subtracting the placebo group’s blood
pressures from those observed in the active treatment group. the t:p ratio for the drug can then be
determined by dividing the trough net reduction in
blood pressure by the largest decrement in blood
pressure.
the global approach has been criticised for its
tendency to overestimate t:p ratios, since it forces
all subjects onto the same time scale, thus blunting
the overall peak blood pressure reduction.[98] this
is due to the large degree of intersubject variability
in the time at which peak decreases in blood pressure occur.
the individual approach generates a t:p ratio
for each individual, thus yielding a range of t:p
ratios rather than estimating a single group t:p ratio.[98] the blood pressure curves (using 24-hour
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) of each
individual are plotted at the end of the placebo washout period and upon completion of randomised treatment. this approach is currently considered the most
accurate and clinically useful method for determining
t:p ratios of antihypertensive agents.[98]
table iv presents the t:p ratios of various ace
inhibitors.
10. conclusion
since the previous review of ace inhibitors in
this journal, several new drugs in this class have
been developed. the pharmacokinetic properties
of five ace inhibitors ( xxxd3409xxx , moexipril,

in this update. dosages of  xxxd3409xxx , moexipril
and imidapril need to be reduced in patients with
renal impairment. multiple doses of  xxxd3237xxx  administered to patients with renal impairment did
not result in significant accumulation of the active
diacid metabolite spiraprilat. also, since  xxxd3305xxx  is primarily excreted in the faeces, it appears that a compensatory increase in biliary excretion occurs in response to renal impairment.
dosage reductions of moexipril and  xxxd3305xxx  are
recommended for elderly patients, and moexipril
dosages should be lower for patients who are
hepatically impaired. moexipril should be taken 1
hour before meals, whereas other ace inhibitors
can be taken without regard to meals.
over the past decade, more attention has been
focused on examining the dose-response effects
and the t:p ratios of ace inhibitors. with the exception of lisinopril, most of the ace inhibitors are
characterised by flat dose-response curves. also,
only three ace inhibitors, fosinopril, ramipril and
 xxxd3409xxx , appear to consistently exhibit t:p ratios
in excess of 50%.
numerous clinical trials have established the effectiveness of ace inhibitors in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, mi and diabetic nephropathy. the results of the cappp and hope trials
have expanded the clinical use of ace inhibitors to
