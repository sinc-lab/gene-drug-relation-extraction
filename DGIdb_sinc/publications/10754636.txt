background: the  xxxd83xxx  (atphensitive potassium (kam)channels protect myocytes during ischemia and
reperfusion. this study investigated the effects of  xxxd3348xxx  on
the activities of katpchannels in isolated rat ventricular myocytes during simulated ischemia.
methods: male wistar rats were anesthetized with ether. single, quiescent ventricular myocytes were dispersed enzymatically. membrane currents were recorded using patch-clamp
techniques. in the cell-attached configuration,  xxxg1253xxx 
currents were assessed before and during activation of these
channels by 2,4-dinitrophenol and after administration of 25,
50, and 100 mg/l  xxxd3348xxx . the open probability was determined from current-amplitude histograms. in the inside-out
configuration,the current-voltage relation was obtained before
and after the application of  xxxd3348xxx (50 mg/l).
results: in the cell-attached configuration, 2,4-dinitrophenoi
caused frequent channel opening. 2,4-dinitrophenol-induced
channel activities were reduced significantly by  xxxd2215xxx ,
suggesting that the channels studied were kam channels. open
probability of  xxxg961xxx .,, channels was reduced by  xxxd3348xxx  in a
concentration-dependent manner. kam channels could be activated in the inside-out configuration because of the absence of
aw.  xxxd3348xxx  inhibited kktpchannel activity without changing the single-channel conductance.
conclusions: the result.. obtained in this study indicate that
 xxxd3348xxx  inhibits kam channel activities in cell-attached and

these channels. (key words: anesthetic; kam channel; patchclamp configuration.)

 xxxd83xxx  (atp)-sensitive potassium
(katp) channels are a family of potassium channels inhibited by intracellular atp. - 3 because katr channels
are gated by intracellular atp, they are thought to link
cellular metabolism with membrane excitability. in
heart cells, katpchannels are activated by depletion of
intracellular atp, hypoxia, or exposure to metabolic
and cause an increase in potassium ion
outward flow. this activation of katpchannels may be
an endogenous protective mechanism against cardiac
damage during myocardial ischemia. in addition, it has
been reported that katp channels play an important role
in ischemic preconditioning’-‘: a brief period of ischemia can make the heart more resistant to subsequent,
more severe episodes of ischemia. as a possible mechanism of cardioprotective action of katp channels, the
activation of sarcolemmal katp channels has been
thought to protect the ischemic myocardium by shortening the action potential duration. that is, the shortening of action potential duration decreases calcium influx
through voltage-dependent calcium channels,” and
causes a decrease in contractility,” which is a major
source of atp consumption, and decreases in calciuminduced cell toxicity,” thereby resulting in the protection of myocytes from further depletion of atp and
irreversible impairment of energy metabolism.l 3 it was
suggested recently that mitochondria1 rather than sarcolemmal k,.,
channels might be playing an important
role in the cardioprotective action of katpchannels. ‘*-i6
studies of the effects of anesthetics on the kati,channel activities in the heart have been performed. in uiuo

halothane, isoflurane, and entlurane, activate katpchan-

nels and have cardioprotective effects.17-23 in contrast,
using a patch-clamp technique, ko et ali2 found that
ketamine inhibits the  xxxg1253xxx  activities in a concentration-dependent manner in rat ventricular myocytes. kozlowski and a ~ h f o r d *also
~ revealed that in
cri-gi insulin-secreting cells thiopental inhibits katr
channel activities if applied to cell-attached patches or
excised inside-out patches. these findings suggest that
ketamine and thiobarbiturates may attenuate the cardioprotective effects of katpchannels during ischemia and
reperfusion in the myocardium. because thiobarbiturates are used a great deal in all types of anesthesia in
patients who have coronary artery disease and are undergoing a variety of surgical procedures, it is important
to evaluate the direct effects of these drugs on the katp
channel activities in the ventricular myocardium during
ischemia. therefore, we evaluated the effects of thiamyid on the katpchannel activities in isolated rat ventricular myocytes during simulated ischemia.

materials and methods
cell isolation
this study was approved by the animal investigation
committee of tokushima university and followed the
guidelines of the american physiological society (bethesda, maryland) for the humane use of animals in
research. fifty-one male wistar rats (weight, 250 -300 g)
were anesthetized with ether, and 1.0 iu/g heparin was
injected intraperitoneally 30 min before surgery. the
chest was opened, and the beating heart was dissected
as soon as the response to tail clamp was lost. the heart
was perfused in a retrograde manner via the aorta using
a langendorff apparatus with standard tyrode’s solution
prewarmed to 37°c and saturated with a 95% oxygen
and 5% carbon dioxide gas mixture. the composition of
standard tyrode’s solution (ph 7.4) was as follows:
naci: 125 mm; nahco,: 24 m ~kci:
; 5.4 mm; nah,po,:
0.47 mm; mgc1,: 1.05 mm; dextrose: 5.5 mm; and caci,:
1.8mm. the heart was perfused with ca2+-freetyrode’s
solution for approximately 5 min until the heart stopped
beating and then was digested with cali-free tyrode’s
solution containing collagenase (0.2 mg/ml) and pronase
(0.05 mg/ml) for 15 min. after enzymatic digestion, the
heart was perfused with low-ca’+ tyrode’s solution
(0.1 mm caci,) for several minutes to wash away the
enzymes. the ventricle was cut into pieces in low-ca2+
tyrode’s solution, and the myocytes were filtered. the
cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was reanesthesiology, v 9 2 , no 4,apr 2000

moved. all cells used in these experiments were rod
shaped and striated.
electrophysiologic measurements
membrane currents were recorded in the cell-attached
and inside-out configurations using a patch-clamp amplifier as described by hamill et u i . , ~the composition of
bath solution for cell-attached mode was as follows: kci:
140 mm; hepes: 10 mm; dextrose: 5.5 mm; and ethyleneglycoltetracetic acid (egta): 0.5 mm. the pipette solution
for cell-attached mode contained 140 mm kcl, 10 mm
hepes, and 5.5 mm dextrose. the composition of bath
solution for inside-out mode was as follows: kc1: 140
mm; hepes: 10 mm; dextrose: 5.5 mm; mgcl,: 1 mm; and
ethyleneglycoltetracetic acid: 0.5 mm. the composition
of pipette solution for the inside-out mode was the same
as that for the cell-attached mode. soft-glass pipettes
prepared in an electrode .puller (pp-830; narishige, tokyo, japan) were used after being coated with sylgard
(dow corning co., midland, mi). the electrical resistance of the patch pipette was 5 to 7 mf2 for single.
channel recording. experiments were conducted with
solution temperatures of 35-37°c. pclamp version 6.0
software (axon instruments, foster, ca) was used to
analyze the data for single-channel currents. the open
probability (npo) was determined from current amplitude histograms and was calculated using the following
equation:

xn.pn
n

npo =

n=o

where n is the number of channels in the patch and pn
is the integrated channel opening. open probability of
katpchannels was determined from recordings longer
than 60 s in duration.

drugs
the  xxxd3348xxx  sodium (yoshitomi chemical, osaka,
japan) ampule was opened before use. 2,4-dinitropheno1 (dnp; sigma chemical, st. louis, mo) and  xxxd2215xxx  (sigma) were prepared as stock solutions. all
other solutions were made daily. collagenase (yakult,
tokyo, japan) and pronase (sigma) were used for enzymatic dissociation.
statistical analysis
data are expressed as the mean f sd. differences
among data sets were evaluated by the student t test. a
p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

to investigate whether  xxxd3348xxx  affects the kat, channel activities in intact ventricular myocytes, we studied

any channel openings in the standard bath solution. if

reversible (fig. 1b). figure 1c shows the blockade of
katr channels by  xxxd3348xxx . figure 2 shows the relation
between relative kat, channel activities and the concentration of  xxxd3348xxx . in 22 patches, the open probabilities
were suppressed by increase the concentration of  xxxd3348xxx . the relative channel activities after administration

inhibition of katp channels by  xxxd3348xxx  occurs in a
dose-dependent manner. a decreased open probability

are important for regulation of cellular energy metabolism associated with membrane excitability.’ during
ischemia and reperfusion, katrchannels open to induce
several protective responses in the heart, katr channels
are responsible for an increase in potassium permeability
and reduction of the action potential duration during
hypoxia and ischemia.’*thus, opening of katpchannels
benefits the heart, possibly by reducing calcium influx
through voltage-dependent calcium channels, slowing
atp depletion, and decreasing calcium-induced toxicity.l* in addition, with reperfusion or reoxygenation,
oxygen free radicals are generated, which could trigger
a chain of damaging chemical reactions resulting in
“reperfusion injury.” free radical-induced injury can be
attenuated by  xxxg1232xxx  openers that act on
katpchannels.26
although han et al2’ reported that, in rabbit ventricular myocytes, isoflurane inhibits the katr channel activities in the inside-out patch-clamp configurations,
there are many in vivo or isolated whole-heart experiments showing that volatile anesthetics, including halothane, isoflurane, and  xxxd1993xxx , activate katpchannels
and have cardioprotective effects.17-23 kanaya and fujita” and kersten et al.19,20 reported that isoflurane
improves regional myocardial contraction and preserves
high-energy phosphate concentrations in a canine model
of myocardial stunning. boutros et az.*l found in isolated
rat hearts that ischemic preconditioning, halothane, and
isoflurane pro\;ide significant protection against ischemia. in addition, kersten et u z . * ~ demonstrated that
pretreatment with isoflurane, similar to ischemic pre-

activities in the inside-out configuration, and washout of
 xxxd3348xxx  reactivated the channel (fig. 3). the average
percentage recovery of the katr channel activity after
 xxxd3348xxx  washout was 89.3 f 6.2% of open probability
obtained before application of  xxxd3348xxx  (n = 26).
the current-voltage relation obtained from 19 patches
before and after the application of  xxxd3348xxx (50 mg/l) is
shown in figure 4 . the current-voltage curves before
and after the application of  xxxd3348xxx  were linear in the
negative potential range, with single-channel conductances of 73.4 ? 1.7 picosiemens (ps) and 75.1 2 2.2 ps
before and after 50 mg/l  xxxd3348xxx , respectively. there
were no statistical differences between control and  xxxd3348xxx -treated series. these results suggest that  xxxd3348xxx 
does not change the katpchannel conductances in the
inside-out configuration.

discussion
the principal findings of this study are that  xxxd3348xxx 
inhibits the katrchannel activities without changing the
single-channel conductance in the inside-out patches
and in the cell-attached patches. although we cannot
discriminate whether  xxxd3348xxx  acts directly on the katp
channel protein or indirectly via alteration of the physical characteristics of the membrane lipids,  xxxd3348xxx 
inhibits the katr channel activities in a membrane-delimited manner rather than through a cytosolic second
messenger, which is absent in the excised inside-out
patch.
