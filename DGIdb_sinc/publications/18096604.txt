reconciling ion channel alpha-subunit expression with native ionic currents and their
pharmacological sensitivity in target organs has proved difficult. in native tissue, many k+
channel alpha-subunits co-assemble with ancillary subunits, which can profoundly affect physiological parameters including gating kinetics and pharmacological interactions. in this review, we
examine the link between voltage-gated potassium ion channel pharmacology and the biophysics
of ancillary subunits. we propose that ancillary subunits can modify the interaction between pore
blockers and ion channels by three distinct mechanisms: changes in (1) binding site accessibility;
(2) orientation of pore-lining residues; (3) the ability of the channel to undergo post-binding
conformational changes. each of these subunit-induced changes has implications for gating,
drug affinity and use dependence of their respective channel complexes. a single subunit
may modulate its associated alpha-subunit by more than one of these mechanisms. voltage-gated
potassium channels are the site of action of many therapeutic drugs. in addition, potassium
channels interact with drugs whose primary target is another channel, e.g. the calcium channel
blocker nifedipine, the sodium channel blocker quinidine, etc. even when k+ channel block
is the intended mode of action, block of related channels in non-target organs, e.g. the heart,
can result in major and potentially lethal side-effects. understanding factors that determine
specificity, use dependence and other properties of k+ channel drug binding are therefore of
vital clinical importance. ancillary subunits play a key role in determining these properties
in native tissue, and so understanding channel–subunit interactions is vital to understanding
clinical pharmacology.

although a single type of k+ channel alpha-subunit is
often present in a variety of different organs, the kinetic
behaviour and conformational changes of alpha-subunits
are often modulated by co-assembly with ancillary
subunits. the expression of ancillary subunits varies
between organs, as well as between regions of an organ
(isom et al. 1994; mccrossan & abbott, 2004; birnbaum
et al. 2004; melnyk et al. 2005). this diversity of ancillary
subunit expression therefore contributes to the diverse
assortment of potassium currents recorded from native
tissues. in addition, relative expression of k+ channels
and their associated ancillary subunits can be affected by
factors such as development, changes in hormonal state,
ischaemic conditions, etc., which can also modulate the
electrophysiology and pharmacology of native potassium
currents (soliven et al. 1989; shimoni et al. 1997;
nerbonne, 1998; liu et al. 2007). the importance of

the role that subunits can play in regulating ion channel
behaviour in native tissue is demonstrated by the number
of mutations which are associated with arrhythmogenesis
and periodic paralysis in humans (for reviews, see chiang
& roden, 2000; abbott & goldstein, 2001; shah et al. 2005).
in addition, indirect alteration in subunit function can lead
to epilepsy in humans (schulte et al. 2006).
compounds with k+ channel blocking properties
are commonly employed as therapeutic agents for
conditions such as arrhythmias (tamargo et al. 2004),
stroke (surti & jan, 2005), cancer (conti, 2004),
and neurological disorders such as psychoses, epilepsy,
stroke and alzheimer’s disease (surti & jan, 2005).
for these therapeutic agents, block of specific k+
channels is the intended mechanism of action (e.g.
class iii anti-arrhythmic agents). however, there are a
wide variety of therapeutic agents that are targeted

to non-k+ channels, but result in unintended block
of k+ channels. this k+ channel block can result in
potentially serious and sometimes even fatal side-effects
(e.g. cardiac arrhythmias). for example, kv channels
are blocked by calcium channel blockers including
nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx  (grissmer et al. 1994; zhang
& fedida, 1998; hatano et al. 2003; bett et al. 2006b),
and sodium channel blockers including quinidine and
 xxxd2113xxx  (yeola & snyders, 1997; caballero et al. 2003;
wang et al. 2003; bett & rasmusson, 2004). even when
k+ channel block is the intended mode of action (for
example, anti-psychotics, anti-epileptics, etc. (davis et al.
1996; escande, 2000; wickenden, 2002)), block of the
same or related ion channels in non-target organs, e.g.
the heart, can result in major and potentially lethal
side-effects such as arrhythmogenesis. side-effects are of
particular importance in the herg channel, which is
the molecular basis of i kr . (see for example sanguinetti
& tristani-firouzi, 2006). the co-assembly of the core
alpha-subunit of an ion channel with a variety of ancillary
subunits results in channels which present a broad
spectrum of potential targets and side-effects for
drugs with channel blocking actions. understanding the
molecular basis of subunit–channel interactions and their
impact on drug binding is therefore of critical importance
in the development of safe pharmacological approaches
for the treatment of arrhythmias, neurological disorders,
and a multitude of other channel-related maladies.
this review focuses on the relationship between the
ability of ancillary subunits to modify the interaction
between voltage-gated k+ channels and drugs which

bind to and block the intracellular vestibule of the open
channel pore. ancillary subunits alter the properties of the
intracellular pore, which can result in direct changes in the
interaction between the drug and the binding site, as well
as changes in gating, which can indirectly affect channel
pharmacology. we discuss three, non-mutually exclusive,
biophysical models by which ancillary subunits could
modify ion channel behaviour. these biophysical models
form a framework for understanding the modification of
drug–channel interactions by ancillary subunits, and are
a necessary step in developing predictive state models of
how drug binding to the open pore is modified by ancillary
subunits.
voltage-gated k+ channels and ancillary
subunits
voltage-gated k+ channels

voltage-gated k+ channels are a large family of ion
channels, which are found in almost every cell type,
and play physiological roles in everything from electrical
excitability to solute transport. a minimally functional k+
channel contains a tetramer of alpha-subunits, each of which
contributes equally to the pore structure. in addition to
the alpha-subunits, which form the core of the channel, many
k+ channels co-assemble in native cells with ancillary
subunits (e.g. kchips (k+ channel interacting proteins),
kcnes and kvbetas), which can result in dramatic changes
in structure, behaviour, and function of the ion channel.
figure 1 shows the topology of a typical pore-forming

figure 1. cartoon representation of kv channels and ancillary subunits
the pore-forming component of kv channels are formed from a tetramer of alpha-subunits. the alpha-subunits have six
transmembrane segments, with intracellular n- and c-terminals. the fourth transmembrane segment has a net
positive charge, and is thought to be the voltage sensor. ancillary subunits interact with the core alpha-subunits in
a variety of ways. the kcne family are single transmembrane proteins, with an intracellular c-terminal and an
extracellular n-terminal. the kchip family of proteins are located intracellularly, and are thought to interact with
the n-terminal. the kvbeta proteins interact with both n- and c-terminals.

alpha-subunit of a  xxxg1244xxx . the n- and
c-terminal domains are on the cytoplasmic side of the
membrane. the channel has six transmembrane segments,
s1–s6, thought to be alpha-helical in structure. a short
lipophilic segment, the ‘h5 loop’, lies between s5 and
s6. the h5 helix dips into the transmembrane domain,
forms a small loop and returns to the extracellular side
(jan & jan, 1992). h5 is thought to be the location of
the selectivity filter of the channel (yool & schwarz, 1991;
lipkind et al. 1995; doyle et al. 1998), and is important
as a locus for extracellular channel blockers. these general
structural elements established in kcsa (doyle et al. 1998)
are well conserved in voltage-gated k+ channels, and have
been confirmed in crystal structures such as kvap and
 xxxg1231xxx  (lee et al. 2005; long et al. 2005a,b).

in all voltage-gated channel models, activation involves a
movement and deformation of s6 at critical hinge regions
(labro et al. 2003; zhao et al. 2004; webster et al. 2004)
as the channel moves from the closed to the open state.
however, the putative open conformation is very different
for the kcsa and  xxxg1231xxx  versus mthk channels (liu et al.
2001; jiang et al. 2002; cuello et al. 2004; lee et al. 2005;
long et al. 2005a,b; zimmer et al. 2006). this suggests
there is tremendous physical diversity in the open channel
conformation, even in related channels. furthermore,
ancillary subunits strongly modify gating properties and
drug binding properties of the open channel, possibly
by the substantial structural rearrangements that occur
as a result of ancillary subunits co-assembling with their
alpha-subunit partners (see table 1 and table 2).

k+ channel activation

k+ channel inactivation

k+ channel activation is a voltage-dependent event, i.e.
channels open in response to a change in membrane
voltage. such voltage dependence requires that a net
charge moves in the transmembrane electrical field in
order to produce the physical work necessary to move
the channel out of the stable closed conformation.
ca2+ , na+ and k+ channels share a similar structure
and common voltage-sensing mechanism. the s4
transmembrane domain in k+ channels contains a highly
conserved structure (lee et al. 2005; long et al. 2005a,b).
every third position is occupied by a lysine or arginine,
which are positively charged in the physiological range
of ph. at the resting membrane potential, many of
these positive charges are on the intracellular face of the
membrane. on membrane depolarization these residues
move through the membrane due to the increased
electrical driving force and reach the extracellular face
(mannuzzu et al. 1996). the transmembrane movement of
s4 initiates large scale conformational changes that result
in an open, conducting pore (catterall, 1995; yellen, 1998;
bezanilla, 2002; lee et al. 2005; long et al. 2005a,b).

inactivation is the process by which a channel becomes
non-conducting in the presence of a continued stimulus.
in general, the process of inactivation is slower than
activation, although there are important exceptions to this
observation, e.g. herg (trudeau et al. 1995; sanguinetti
et al. 1995). the molecular basis of k+ channel inactivation
was originally based on data from shaker k+ channels.
mutagenesis studies showed at least two mechanisms of
inactivation, called ‘n-type’ and ‘c-type’ (hoshi et al.
1991).

the k+ channel open state

channel opening involves a significant change in protein
structure. one of the most important rearrangements
is opening or widening of the intracellular pore. this
widening is often referred to as the ‘intracellular gate’
(holmgren et al. 1998). the entire
pore volume has been
a
measured to be ∼800–2000 a3 for voltage-gated na+ and
k+ channels i.e. the volume of ∼50 water molecules
(zimmerberg et al. 1990; rayner et al. 1992; jiang et al.
2003). there are three general pictures of intracellular pore
opening based on crystal structure measurements. the s6
transmembrane segment is thought to play a prominent
role in lining the pore in the open channel models of both
kcsa,  xxxg1231xxx  and mthk channels (liu et al. 2001; jiang et al.
2002; cuello et al. 2004; lee et al. 2005; long et al. 2005a,b).

n-type inactivation. the best understood inactivation

mechanism is n-type, which occurs on the order
of ∼milliseconds to ∼tens of milliseconds. n-type
inactivation is mediated by a ‘tethered ball’ mechanism
in which a lipophilic segment of ∼20 amino acids in the
n-terminus of the channel binds at the intracellular pore
mouth (zagotta et al. 1990; hoshi et al. 1990, 1991). n-type
inactivation has a number of well-defined properties: (1)
n-type inactivation is removed after n-terminal deletion
(hoshi et al. 1990); (2) n-type inactivation is insensitive to
extracellular [tea+ ] but sensitive to intracellular [tea+ ]
(choi et al. 1991; demo & yellen, 1991); (3) n-type
inactivation is unaffected by increased [k+ ]o (rasmusson
et al. 1995); (4) the rate of n-type inactivation is voltage
insensitive at positive potentials (zagotta & aldrich, 1990);
(5) n-type inactivation is insensitive to point mutations
at the outer mouth of the channel or the outer region of
s6 (hoshi et al. 1991; rasmusson et al. 1995).
c-type inactivation. in k+ channels, c-type inactivation

is defined as the inactivation mechanism that remains
following the loss of n-type inactivation i.e. following
n-terminal deletion (hoshi et al. 1991; hille, 2001). c-type
inactivation involves small conformational changes at
the extracellular side of the pore, and a substantial
conformational change (on the same order as channel
opening) at the intracellular side of the channel pore

ancillary subunits and k+ channel block

include the extracellular side of s6 (hoshi et al. 1991), the
intracellular side of s6 (li et al. 2003; bett & rasmusson,
2004) and a specific residue in the extracellular h5–s6
loop (position 449 in shaker b) (lopez-barneo et al.
1993; wang et al. 2003). c-type inactivation is slowed by
increasing external permeant ion concentrations (busch
et al. 1991; lopez-barneo et al. 1993) and by the application
of extracellular, but not intracellular, tea+ (choi et al.
1991). thus, c-type inactivation was determined to
involve closure of the extracellular pore mouth and
cooperative interactions between multiple core alpha-subunits
(ogielska et al. 1995; kiss et al. 1999; andalib et al.
2004). the movements associated with c-type inactivation
involve more than just small regional changes on the
extracellular face of the pore; changes in intracellular pore
diameter (jiang et al. 2003; panyi & deutsch, 2007), and
transmembrane spanning domains (hoshi et al. 1991;
adelman et al. 1995; li et al. 2003; bett & rasmusson,
2004) have also been implicated, as have deeper regions of
the selectivity filter (kurata et al. 2005; panyi & deutsch,
2007; cordero-morales et al. 2007).
drug binding to the open k+ channel

potassium channels interact with a wide variety of drugs.
for manageability, this review considers only the binding
of drugs to the open pore of voltage-gated potassium
channels. however, a similar analysis can be applied to
conformational-specific drug binding to other states and
channels. drug binding to an intracellular pore site or
vestibule is a well established concept (see hille, 2001).
more recently, site-directed mutagenesis has enabled
identification of the key pore residues which form the
binding site in the intracellular pore. analysis of crystal
structures of the pore region has shown the relative
positions of these key residues, and the physical nature
of the binding site.
the  xxxg1234xxx  s6 binding domains for quinidine were
among the first to be mapped (yeola et al. 1996).
other drug–channel combinations have subsequently
been mapped against the putative crystal structure of this
region (seebohm et al. 2001, 2003; chen et al. 2002). in
some cases, a projection of the drug binding interactions
in terms of individual van der waal’s interactions has
been accomplished for high-affinity, high-specificity drugs
(chen et al. 2002). these mappings agree well with the
putative closed state kcsa structure (doyle et al. 1998),
despite the drugs having the properties of open channel
blockers. analysis of quaternary ammonium binding has
also been interpreted in the context of the putative closed
structure of the kcsa channel (doyle et al. 1998). analysis
of the crystal structure of this channel bound to the
n-terminal inactivation ball showed some interesting
characteristics. in addition to having structural orientation
similar to the closed state of the channel, the n-terminal

‘ball’ bound with the n-terminal amino acids in an
extended chain (zhou et al. 2001), lining the pore, instead
of the much more rounded structure predicted for these
domains in solution using nmr (wissmann et al. 1999).
this structural information suggests that drug binding and
n-terminal-inactivated states may involve considerable
secondary changes in channel structure following initial
binding to the open state.
for some drug–channel combinations, the degree of
block observed depends on the stimulation frequency.
when the block of an open channel blocking drug
increases with stimulation frequency, this is called use
dependence. use dependence is thought to arise from
the interplay of two kinetic parameters: the rate of drug
binding/unbinding, and the transition rate of the channel
between states (starmer et al. 1984; gintant & hoffman,
1984; hondeghem & katzung, 1984). this occurs because
some drugs bind only to, or preferentially to, specific
open or closed states of the channel, i.e. some drugs
display a variety of conformation-specific interactions
with k+ channels. the amount of time a voltage-gated
channel spends in any particular state depends in large
part on the membrane potential. conformation-specific
interactions can therefore alter drug block of a given
channel by orders of magnitude, depending on the
pattern of electrical stimulation (armstrong, 1969, 1971;
strichartz, 1973; hondeghem & katzung, 1977; starmer
et al. 1984). this remains a current topic of research
in voltage-gated potassium channels (e.g. spector et al.
1996; zhang et al. 1999; jo et al. 2000; kushida
et al. 2002; persson et al. 2005; bett et al. 2006a,b; stork et al.
2007). these variations in patterns of use dependence can
either be clinically detrimental (i.e. the drug has reduced
effectiveness) or beneficial (e.g. the drug is only effective
during periods of tachycardia) (hondeghem & snyders,
1990). ancillary subunits can alter the conformation of
k+ channels, as well as alter gating kinetics and the
response of the channel to stimulation frequency. the
presence of ancillary subunits can therefore modulate
the relationship between drug and channel, in some cases
quite dramatically.
biophysical models of subunit modification
of k+ channel behaviour
ancillary subunits can strongly modulate drug–channel
interactions (tables 1 and 2). as more channel defects
that affect drug–channel interactions are identified,
understanding subunit–channel interactions will be
critical in identifying the consequences of these defects.
drug–channel interactions are strongly influenced by
channel gating, as well as the structure of the binding
site. in an effort to develop a general framework for
understanding how the relationship between ion channels
and drug binding is affected by the presence of ancillary

934

subunits, we will examine subunit–drug–channel interactions in terms of mechanisms of interaction between
subunit in the pore/vestibule region. this biophysical
classification may help form the basis for developing predictive state models of drug binding to the open pore, and
how these models are modified in the presence of subunits.
we propose that the subunit-induced changes in
drug–channel interactions can be separated into three
discrete but related components with distinct molecular
mechanisms:
1. ancillary subunits can modulate the ability of drugs
to access the binding site in the open pore.
2. ancillary subunits can modulate the orientation of
residues (primarily on s6) which confer specificity of drug
binding.
3. ancillary subunits can modulate the ability of
the channel to undergo conformational changes (e.g.
inactivation and closure) following drug block.
these three mechanisms are not necessarily exclusive
but can, and probably do, co-exist in any combination in
any given channel–subunit unit. many features of gating
and open pore drug binding are similar across the family of
voltage-gated channels, so it is likely this biophysical model
can be successfully applied to open pore drug binding
modulation in other voltage-gated channels.
ancillary subunits can modulate the ability of drugs
to access the binding site in the open pore

in order for a drug to bind to the intracellular pore of a
channel, the drug must be able to reach its binding site.
for open-pore blockers, this requires that the channel is
in the open state and the drug can reach the binding site.
a simple state model of a drug binding to the open pore
in a channel with closed (c), open (o), blocked (b) and
blocked-inactivated (bi) states is given by:

scheme (1)

a schematic representation of this model is shown in
fig. 2a. the simplest method by which  xxxg220xxx  can
decrease the ability of a drug to reach the open pore binding
site is by physical occlusion of the binding site. figure 2b
shows how an ancillary subunit that binds to the pore
drug binding site will alter the interaction between drug
and channel. if the subunit blocks access to the pore or
competes at the open pore binding site (e.g. rasmusson
et al. 1997; de biasi et al. 1997), then the subunit must
unbind before the drug can gain access to the binding site.
the equivalent state model is:
c  o  b  bi
scheme (2)
s

j physiol 586.4

where s is the state in which the subunit is bound to
the pore of the channel. electrophysiologically recorded
current flow is only a measure of the time the channel
spends in the open state. the effect of the addition of the
subunit-bound state will therefore depend on the relative
magnitude of the transition rates between the open and
blocked states, and the open and subunit-bound states.
the introduction of the subunit-bound state may result in
a change in apparent affinity of the drug for the channel,
even though the actual affinity of the channel has not
changed. changes in the apparent affinity are usually
measured as reduction in peak current, but depending on
model specifics, the actual changes in affinity can often be
calculated from the changes in gating (bett & rasmusson,
2002).
in some cases, inactivation and drug block are
competitive processes. a schematic depiction of the most
simple case of competitive binding and inactivation is
shown in fig. 3a. the equivalent state model is given by:

similar to scheme (2), the net effect on the electrophysiologically measured current will depend on the
relative magnitudes of the four transitions out of the open
state. although the rate of transition from the open to the
drug-bound state is not changed by the presence of the
ancillary subunit, there may be a change in the apparent
affinity for the drug, due to the addition of the extra
subunit-blocked state. physical occlusion of the binding
site that competes with drug binding is most easily understood in terms of the addition of an ‘n-terminal ball’, which
kvbeta-subunits introduce to kv channels (see section 3.1).
physical occlusion of the pore by the ancillary subunit
itself is not the only way in which access to the binding can
be altered. in order for the binding site to be accessible,
the channel must be in the open conformation, and the
conformation of the intracellular pore must enable the
drug to reach the binding site. changes in channel gating
can result in a change of accessibility to the binding site
i.e. the amount of time the channel spends in the open
state. deactivated, closed and resting channels usually have
an intracellular gate which precludes the entry of open
channel blockers to their s6 binding site (holmgren et al.

ancillary subunits and k+ channel block

1998; del camino & yellen, 2001). addition of extra closed
states increases the complexity of the opening process,
and can introduce a sigmoid delay between stimulus and
channel opening. a reduction in the time the channel is in
the open state can reduce the apparent binding affinity of
a drug for the channel.

alternatively, addition of extra open states, which
have altered (or zero) affinity for the drug, will result
in a change in apparent binding affinity. in the case
where co-expression with an ancillary subunit results in
additional open states with altered affinity for the drug,
there cannot be an increase in the apparent affinity of the
drug for the channel without re-orientation of the residues
involved in creating the binding site.

conversely, the presence of ancillary subunits can result
in a reduction in the number of states, which can result in
an increase in the ability of the drug to access the binding
site. the most dramatic form of this is when the channel
is not able to move in or out of the open state, and the
binding site is always accessible, as is approximated by the
case of kcne3 interacting with  xxxg1268xxx  (see section 3.3):
o

if accessibility to the pore binding site is changed by either
physical block or changes in gating, there is a change in
the number of states present in the equivalent state model.
these changes will affect the rate at which the channel
can return to the drug-unbound closed state, and so will
usually affect the use dependence of the channel.
in summary, if the subunit modulates ion channel–drug
interactions by altering the ability of the drug to access the

associated with it that can bind to the open pore, then, following pore opening, the subunit can block access of
the drug to the binding site, thus altering binding site accessibility.

of the channel.

the actual affinity.
3. changes in use dependence
ancillary subunits can modulate the orientation
of residues (primarily on s6) which confer specificity
of drug binding

the traditional view of drug binding is often presented
in terms of a ‘lock and key’ type of interaction. the
lock and key hypothesis suggests that specific epitopes
on a drug (the key) interact with specific side chains of
pore-lining residues (the lock). this requires that the lock,
i.e. the pore-lining residues, is in a particular physical
orientation. however, the transmembrane segments of a
channel are composed of a mixture of rigid and hinged
structures which can adopt a number of different physical
orientations and therefore the pore-lining side chains are
able to adopt different physical conformations which still
form an open vestibule capable of conducting ions. this
is shown in fig. 4a, which demonstrates how movement

j physiol 586.4

(e.g. rotation) of the side chains on the s6 segment orients
the side chain residues to form the binding site in the open
state. if an ancillary subunit interferes with rotation of s6
during gating in such a situation, then the side chains which
form the lock can end up in altered relative orientations
(fig. 4b). changing the orientation of the binding site
residues can result in a binding site with either an increased
or decreased affinity for the drug. examples of subunits
that increase affinity of a drug for the channel are the
kcnes and  xxxg1268xxx  (see section 3.3).
a schematic representation of ancillary subunits altering
the binding site is shown in fig. 5. there is no change
in the ability of the drug to access the binding site,
only a difference in the interaction between the drug
and the side chains forming the binding site. the only
transition affected is therefore that between the open and
the drug-bound state. the equivalent state model is:

an increase or a decrease in the affinity of the drug for the
channel.
use dependence depends on the transition and drug
binding rates of the drug–channel combination relative
to the stimulation frequency. changing the conformation
of the binding site can result in a dramatic increase or
decrease in the rate at which the drug binds and unbinds
to the channel.  xxxg220xxx  that increases the rate at which a
drug unbinds has the potential to reduce or eliminate use
dependence. conversely,  xxxg220xxx  that decreases the rate
at which a drug unbinds from a channel has the potential
to increase use dependence. experimental examples of this
include kchip2b, which eliminates use dependence from
 xxxg1244xxx , and  xxxg1245xxx , which introduces use dependence to
 xxxg1268xxx  (see sections 3.2 and 3.3).
in summary, a change in the orientation of the residues
lining the pore results in:
1. a change (either an increase or decrease) in the actual
affinity of the drug for the channel
2. no changes in the number of states
3. any changes in use dependence will follow changes
in the on-rate and/or off-rate of drug binding
ancillary subunits can modulate the ability of the
channel to undergo conformational changes (e.g.
inactivation and closure) following drug block

when a drug binds to the residues lining the pore, there
will be a release of energy as the drug and channel
interact. this drug–binding site interaction can result in
deformation of the channel, which can either promote or

j physiol 586.4

inhibit the normal conformational changes associated with
channel gating. in addition, the physical presence of the
drug can alter the ability of the channel to adopt certain
conformational changes it would otherwise undergo. for
example, the mere physical presence of a blocker in the
pore can prevent deactivation and normal closure of
the pore (for reviews see rasmusson et al. 1994; bett &
rasmusson, 2002). alternatively, drug binding to the open
pore can compete with the n-terminal domain ‘ball and
chain’ binding, and result in a slowing of the development
of n-type inactivation (rasmusson et al. 1994). these
‘foot in the door’ type of mechanisms of drug–channel
interactions (armstrong, 1966) are relatively easy to
understand, and result in the relatively simple kinetic
predictions (bett & rasmusson, 2002). if a channel cannot
deactivate, close or inactivate in the presence of an open
channel blocking drug, then the drug-bound site becomes
an additional blocked state which only has transitions to
and from the open state.
for a growing number of channels and drugs it
is becoming clear that the presence of a drug bound
to an intracellular binding site can promote further
conformational changes that confer many of the timeand use-dependent properties of drug action (baukrowitz
& yellen, 1996; balser et al. 1996; rasmusson et al.
1998; bett & rasmusson, 2002; sandtner et al. 2004).
lipophilic open channel blocking compounds can increase
the rate of development and stability of the c-type
inactivated state (baukrowitz & yellen, 1996; wang et al.
2003; bett & rasmusson, 2004). stabilization of the
c-type inactivated state can result in a very slowly
recovering open channel block, if the alpha-subunit has

slowly recovering c-type inactivation. promotion of a
stable c-type inactivation mechanism in  xxxg1233xxx  is critically
dependent upon lipophilic interactions and the movement
of s6 (bett & rasmusson, 2004). drug binding that
causes allosteric interactions involving the pore mouth
and intra- and extracellular domains of s6 can create a
long-lived, combined drug-bound and c-type-inactivated
state which governs recovery and use dependence. a
general picture of binding to the open pore is emerging
in which drug binding properties are strongly dependent
on the rotational mobility and stability of s6. movement
of s6 links key elements that govern the accessibility and
orientation of the high-affinity binding site in response to
both activation and inactivation. in addition, the induced
conformational changes that follow initial drug binding
are critically dependent upon the flexibility and movement
of s6.
any intervention which limits the ability of the
channel to adopt certain conformations following drug
block will therefore be predicted to alter drug–channel
relationships. an ancillary subunit can block post-binding
conformational changes either by physically preventing the
channel from adopting the conformation or by making
transitions less energetically favourable.
figure 7 shows a schematic representation of the effects
of  xxxg220xxx  altering the post-binding conformational
changes following drug binding. there are no additional
states, and the affinity of the channel for the drug is not
affected. only the transition from the drug-bound to the
drug-bound inactivated state is affected. the equivalent

state model is given by:

this model applies equally well to channels that can close
with the drug bound, i.e. exhibit trapping block:

c  o  b  bc


scheme (11)

where bc is a blocked-closed (deactivated) state.
the changes to the transition rates shown in
schemes (10) and (11) will affect the stability of
the blocked-inactivated or blocked-closed states. these
changes can affect properties such as apparent threshold
for activation, recovery from inactivation, and use
dependence. channels that bind drugs which become
trapped in the deactivated or closed channel may require
a higher applied voltage to activate as the closed/trapped
state can become more stable relative to the open state.
this would appear as an apparent shift in the voltage
of activation. if the presence of  xxxg220xxx  makes the
transition to the drug-bound inactivated state less
energetically favourable, the inactivated state may be less
stable, and recovery from inactivation may be more rapid
than without the subunit.
the rate at which the channel recovers from the open
state is a key determinant of use dependence. if the subunit
creates a relatively unstable inactivated state with rapid

figure 7. changes in post-binding transitions
following drug binding, some channels undergo significant conformational changes. if the presence of  xxxg220xxx 
alters the ability of the channel to undergo these changes, there will be a change in the transition rates between
the drug-bound and drug-bound-inactivated states.

recovery from inactivation, this would have the potential
to decrease use dependence. conversely,  xxxg220xxx  that
promotes a stable slowly recovering inactivated state has
the potential to increase use dependence.
in summary, a change in the ability of the channel to
undergo conformational changes following drug binding:
(1) does not affect actual initial binding/affinity; (2) can
affect activation voltage; (3) affects the stability of the
inactivated state; and (4) affects use dependence
experimental observations of modulation
of k+ channel gating and pharmacology by
ancillary subunits
the three distinct mechanisms detailed above can co-exist
with each other in any channel–subunit pair. in this section
we review some experimental data on how drug–channel
interactions are modified by the presence of ancillary
subunits and test the applicability of the three components
of our biophysical model. ancillary subunits interact with
their core alpha-subunits in a variety of ways including altering
cell surface expression, acting as redox sensors, intracellular calcium concentration sensors, etc. (for a review
see patel & campbell, 2005). for the analysis of the
biophysical model, we are only interested in how ancillary
subunits modify open channel drug binding.
kvbeta-subunits and kv1.x channels

the kvbetas were the first family of voltage-gated k+ channels
ancillary subunits to be isolated (rettig et al. 1994; scott
et al. 1994; morales et al. 1995; mccormack et al. 1995).
kvbeta-subunits are relatively large protein structures, with
two functional domains: a core c-terminal domain, which
associates with the alpha-subunit domain, and an n-terminal
domain, which varies in length.
kvbetas interact with the kv1.x family of voltage-gated
ion channels, which are homologs of the shaker channels
from drosophila.  xxxg1234xxx  and  xxxg1233xxx  alpha-subunits are thought
to be the molecular basis of the ultrarapid delayed rectifier
current in human atrium (i kur ) (wang et al. 1994; li
et al. 1996; yue et al. 1996; feng et al. 1998) and a slowly
recovering transient outward k+ current in mammalian
endocardium (i to,s ) (brahmajothi et al. 1999), respectively.
in addition,  xxxg1233xxx  and  xxxg1234xxx  are thought to be the
molecular basis of a-type currents in tissues including
brain (sheng et al. 1993; chung et al. 2001) and smooth
muscle (lu et al. 2001; fergus et al. 2003; mcgahon et al.
2007).
kvbeta-subunits assemble on the intracellular side
of kv1.x channels, and interact with both n- and
c-terminal domains. most kvbeta-subunits induce a ‘ball
and chain’ binding to the open pore mechanism,
reminiscent of n-type inactivation in shaker-related

j physiol 586.4

channels (heinemann et al. 1994; rettig et al. 1994;
morales et al. 1995, 1996; england et al. 1995; heinemann
et al. 1995, 1996). the lipophilic domain of the n-terminus
of the beta-subunit binds to the same region of the pore as
lipophilic channel blockers (rettig et al. 1994; de biasi
et al. 1997; rasmusson et al. 1997; zhou et al. 2001). the
addition of rapid n-type inactivation suggests that kvbetas
modulate drug binding via a competitive limitation of
open channel accessibility in a manner similar to fig. 2
and scheme (2).
the introduction of the extra subunit-bound state to
the kv1.x channels predicts that the rate of development of
apparent current inactivation/block in the presence of the
kvbeta-subunits should be additive in nature, but of a lower
apparent affinity. this has been demonstrated for internal
block by bupivicaine, quinidine and the  xxxd189xxx 
s0100176 in  xxxg1234xxx  channels with kvbeta1.3 (gonzalez et al.
2002; decher et al. 2005).
there may be additional interactions between kv1
channels and kvbeta-subunits. the presence of kvbeta slows
the rate of recovery from inactivation of  xxxg1233xxx , which
has an intrinsic n-terminal ‘ball and chain’ inactivation
mechanism, but does not affect recovery from inactivation
of  xxxg1233xxx  n, which is a  xxxg1233xxx  construct with the
n-terminal removed (castellino et al. 1995; accili et al.
1998). this suggests that subunits may have some effect
on the inactivated state. the core domain of the beta-subunit
may interact with the alpha-subunit in an allosteric way
resulting in an alteration of the pore structure, and the
arrangement of the drug binding site. such a possibility
is suggested by the ability of the core domain to shift the
activation kinetics of  xxxg1234xxx  channels (uebele et al. 1996)
and by recent reports of the effects of the core domain
of kvbeta1 on inactivation rates of mutant kv1 channels
(weng et al. 2006 but see bahring et al. 2001b). however,
the dominant mechanism of modulation of drug binding
seems to be via competitive interaction in those beta-subunits
possessing an intact ‘ball and chain’ mechanism.
in summary, kvbeta-subunits may have some mild affect
on the orientation of residues forming the binding site
and the stability of the bound-inactivated state in kv1
channels, but the primary mechanism of kvbeta regulation
of kv1 drug–channel interactions appears to be through
changes in the accessibility of the drug to the binding site
(see section 2.1).
kchips and kv4.x channels

kv channel interacting proteins or kchips, are a diverse
group of proteins that are part of the large neuronal intracellular calcium-sensing protein family (an et al. 2000;
bahring et al. 2001a; burgoyne & weiss, 2001; nakamura
et al. 2001; jerng et al. 2004; patel & campbell, 2005).
kchips are thought to bind to the n-terminal of the kv4
family of k+ channels (an et al. 2000).

j physiol 586.4

ancillary subunits and k+ channel block

the kv4.x family of channels mediate a rapidly
recovering transient outward current (i to,f ) in the
myocardium (brahmajothi et al. 1999; tseng, 1999; oudit
et al. 2001) and an a-type current (i sa ) in the brain
(jerng et al. 2004). the kv4 channel family has been less
extensively studied than the kv1 family in part because
of the complex gating of this channel, which remains
the subject of debate. kv4 channels have a complex
multi-exponential inactivation process, the molecular
basis of which is unclear (jerng & covarrubias, 1997; jerng
et al. 1999; nakamura et al. 2001; wang et al. 2005). the
core alpha-subunits of the kv4.x channels recapitulate many
of the properties of native i to,f and i sa , but the gating of the
heterologously expressed cloned channels does not match
the native currents. many of the differences in inactivation
and recovery between the kv4s and the cardiac i to,f can be
reconciled by co-expression of  xxxg1244xxx  with kchip2b (kuo
et al. 2001; patel et al. 2002a,b; shibata et al. 2003). in the
brain, the co-localization of kchips and kv4 channels has
heterogeneous regional and cellular distribution (an et al.
2000; rhodes et al. 2004).
the gating mechanisms underlying kv4.x channel
activity remain highly controversial, as the molecular basis
for the components of kv4.x inactivation do not match the
criteria for either the n- or c-type inactivation seen in kv
channels (rasmusson et al. 1998; wang et al. 2005). the
effect of kchips on the inactivation rate of  xxxg1244xxx  channels
is modest, usually resulting in a mild decrease in the rate
of inactivation, depending on the particular kchip splice
variant and the voltage (an et al. 2000; beck et al. 2002;
deschenes & tomaselli, 2002; van hoorick et al. 2003;
patel et al. 2004).
kchips also affect transitions from the inactivated
state, dramatically increasing the speed of recovery from
inactivation (an et al. 2000; decher et al. 2001; patel et al.
2002a; deschenes & tomaselli, 2002; beck et al. 2002;
boland et al. 2003). this suggests that the inactivated
state which the channel enters is less stable when the
kchip is present. when recovery from inactivation is
measured in the presence of nifedipine,  xxxg1244xxx  channels
recover more slowly than without the drug. however, when
kchips are present, nifedipine has no effect on the rate
of recovery from inactivation (bett et al. 2006b). this
suggests that not only do kchips make the inactivated
state less stable, but they also prevent the channel from
entering the longer lived drug-bound inactivated state.
in other words, kchips have altered the ability of kv4
channels to undergo conformational changes subsequent
to drug binding. on a structural level, this could be
interpreted as kchips reducing the flexibility or ‘stiffening’
the channel, which inhibits the channel from developing
the slowly recovering inactivated and inactivated/blocked
states which  xxxg1244xxx  channels usually enter.
kchips affect the ability of several open channel
blockers to bind to kv4 channels. kchip co-expression

results in a decreased sensitivity to kv4 block by nifedipine,
 xxxd2718xxx , bupivicaine and ropivicaine (hatano et al.
2003; friederich & solth, 2004; solth et al. 2005; bett
et al. 2006b). if kchips modulate drug binding by altering
accessibility to the binding site, the fact that kchips
reduce the speed of inactivation would suggest that drugs
have more time to access the binding site, and so should
modestly increase the apparent affinity of the drug for the
channel. however, the decreased affinity for some drugs
suggest that changing the accessibility due to altered gating
is not the primary mechanism by which kchips modulate
drug–channel affinity.
further evidence for kchips having a direct effect on
the binding site is the fact that although kchip2.2 reduces
the rate of inactivation of  xxxg1244xxx  channels, with the result
that accessibility to the binding site is increased, the rate
of development of block by ropivicane and  xxxd383xxx 
are both slowed in the presence of kchip2.2 (friederich &
solth, 2004; solth et al. 2005). these changes to the rate at
which the drug binds are opposite to the changes predicted
by slowed inactivation gating, which suggests they are a
direct result of changes in the affinity of the drug for the
open pore binding site, as a consequence of a change in the
conformation of the binding site residues.
in summary, kchips appear to interact with kv4
channels by two of the mechanisms in the biophysical
model: kchips appear to change the orientation of pore
residues, resulting in a change in the interaction between
drug and channel (see section 2.2). in addition, kchips
may affect the stability of the inactivated state, and prevent
conformational changes of the channel subsequent to drug
binding (see section 2.3).
kcnes and  xxxg1268xxx 

although the kcne subunit proteins are relatively small,
they have dramatic effects on activation of voltage-gated
channels. kcne subunits are composed of 57–150 amino
acids that cross the membrane, with an intracellular
c-terminal and an extracellular n-terminal (mccrossan
& abbott, 2004). kcne subunits interact with  xxxg1268xxx 
alpha-subunits.
 xxxg1268xxx  ( xxxg1268xxx  or  xxxg1268xxx ) is a member of the kcnq
k+ channel gene family (barhanin et al. 1996; sanguinetti
et al. 1996; wang et al. 1996; yang & sigworth, 1998).
 xxxg1268xxx  is found in an exceedingly diverse range of tissues
including the heart, neuronal tissue, kidney, colonic crypt
cells, pituitary, the stria vascularis and the vestibular dark
cells of the cochlea, stomach, small intestine, liver, thymus,
exocrine pancreas, prostate, skeletal muscle, airway
epithelia, ovarian tissue, testis, uterus and placenta (vetter
et al. 1996; wang et al. 1996; brahmajothi et al. 1996;

the tissue-specific characteristics of electrophysiologically recorded  xxxg1268xxx  current are diverse, due
to strong modification of  xxxg1268xxx  by ancillary subunits.
in cardiac myocytes,  xxxg1268xxx  is co-expressed with a
small single transmembrane domain ancillary subunit,
 xxxg1245xxx  (mink).  xxxg1268xxx – xxxg1245xxx  forms a k+ channel
that reproduces the slowly activating delayed-rectifier
current (i ks ), responsible for repolarization of the cardiac
action potential (sanguinetti et al. 1996). mutations
in  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1245xxx  have been linked to prolonged
qt of the cardiac ekg, and fatal arrhythmias (long qt
syndrome).  xxxg1268xxx – xxxg1245xxx  results in currents with
greatly slowed kinetics of activation and deactivation,
and no voltage-dependent inactivation. in epithelial
tissues,  xxxg1268xxx  associates with the single transmembrane
domain subunit kcne3 (schroeder et al. 2000), which
produces a constitutively open, voltage-independent k+
current.
chromanol 293b is a lipophilic drug that is thought to
bind to the open pore of  xxxg1268xxx  (seebohm et al. 2001).
kcne subunits have a dramatic effect on the affinity and
use dependence of drugs for  xxxg1268xxx  (seebohm et al. 2001;
bett et al. 2006a). the apparent affinities of chromanols
293b, hmr 1556, s5557, as well as  xxxd272xxx , xe991 and 17
beta- xxxd2037xxx  are increased by over an order of magnitude
depending on subunit composition (busch et al. 1997;
wang et al. 2000; lerche et al. 2000; tinel et al. 2000;
schroeder et al. 2000; macvinish et al. 2001; bett et al.
2006a).
kcne3 appears to ‘lock’ the channel in an open
position, resulting in a constitutively open channel
(schroeder et al. 2000; melman et al. 2001). this suggests
that part of the increased affinity for  xxxg1268xxx –kcne3
may be caused, at least in part, by increased access time
to the binding site when kcne3 is present. conversely,
 xxxg1245xxx  greatly increases the sigmoid delay in activation
of  xxxg1268xxx , and appears to prevent the channel from
entering the inactivated state (seebohm et al. 2005). the
net result is that  xxxg1245xxx  decreases the amount of time
the channel spends in the open state, at most physiologically important potentials relative to  xxxg1268xxx  expressed
alone. however, in both cases, the presence of the subunit
greatly increases drug affinity. therefore, the changes in
gating cannot account for changes in affinity. the kcne
subunits probably also modify the orientation of
the residues which form the drug binding site. the
presence of this mechanism is further supported by
mutagenesis results which demonstrate that the kinetic
and affinity effects of kcne3 and  xxxg1245xxx  can be
changed independently (bett et al. 2006a). when
 xxxg1268xxx  channels are co-expressed with kcne3 with
the valine at position 72 mutated to a threonine, the
channels are no longer constitutively open, but have

j physiol 586.4

voltage-dependent gating (melman et al. 2002). although
the  xxxg1268xxx –kcne3[v72t] channel spends much less
time in the open state than the  xxxg1268xxx –kcne3 channels,
the high affinity phenotype is retained. this suggests that
it is a structural change in the binding site rather than
the change in gating which is the dominant factor in
determining chromanol 293b affinity.  xxxg1268xxx  has been
reported to have multiple open states (pusch et al. 2001),
so kcne subunits may work by modifying the number
and/or stability of  xxxg1268xxx  open and closed states and the
ability of drugs to bind to these states.  xxxg1268xxx  alone has a
fast early activation which reaches a stable steady state. in
contrast,  xxxg1268xxx – xxxg1245xxx  activation is relatively complex,
with a relatively slow sigmoid time course, and a second
very slowly developing component. the time-course of
open channel block in  xxxg1268xxx – xxxg1245xxx  channels occurs
relatively slowly following channel opening, and may
actually reflect a balance between multiple open states such
as those reported for the  xxxg1268xxx  channel alone (pusch
et al. 2001). these multiple open states may be modulated
by kcne subunits, and may have different affinities for
open channel blockers such as chromanol 293b (bett et al.
2006a).
rapid repetitive stimulation of  xxxg1268xxx –kcne
channels results in a significant increase in channel block,
which is not seen in  xxxg1268xxx  channels (seebohm et al.
2001; bett et al. 2006a). the ability of  xxxg1245xxx  to introduce
use dependence to  xxxg1268xxx  channels, even though  xxxg1245xxx 
removes the  xxxg1268xxx  inactivated state is consistent
with the hypothesis that the  xxxg1245xxx  subunit alters the
conformational changes that the channel undergoes once
the drug has bound.
in summary, data currently available on  xxxg1268xxx 
support the notion that  xxxg1245xxx  and kcne3 appear to
modify the drug binding properties of  xxxg1268xxx  channel
by three distinct mechanisms: (1) changing binding site
accessibility (see section 2.1); (2) changing the orientation
of pore lining residues thus modifying the binding
site (see section 2.2); and (3) limiting the ability of
the channel to undergo gating conformational changes
secondary to drug binding (see section 2.3). however,
the relationship between these components and specific
drug–channel–subunit interactions remains a current
topic of research.
kcnes and herg

in addition to interacting with the  xxxg1268xxx  channel, kcne
subunits have been seen to interact with other kv channels
including the herg channel, or  xxxg1246xxx  (mcdonald et al.
1997; abbott et al. 1999; schroeder et al. 2000; mazhari
et al. 2001; ohyama et al. 2001; weerapura et al. 2002;
lu et al. 2003). the herg alpha-subunit is thought to
be the molecular basis of the  xxxg1244xxx 
underlying cardiac i kr (warmke & ganetzky, 1994;

ancillary subunits and k+ channel block

trudeau et al. 1995; sanguinetti et al. 1995). the drug
binding site in the intracellular pore has been well
described in the herg channel. in particular, two
aromatic residues (tyrosine y652 and phenylalanine f656)
on s6 are thought to play a critical role in drug–channel
interactions for several herg open channel blockers
(mitcheson et al. 2000). drug binding to the open herg
pore is thought to be highly conformation dependent (see
sanguinetti & tristani-firouzi, 2006).
the herg channel gating has some unique features
such as the rate of inactivation being faster than activation
at positive potentials. this makes state-dependent analysis
of channel activity difficult, and results can be influenced
by voltage protocols used to obtain them and the analysis
used to interpret the data. data on the effect of kcne2
(mirp1) on herg gating is therefore understandably
mixed. kcne2 has been suggested to slow or speed the
rate at which herg activates and speeds deactivation, or
have little effect at all (abbott et al. 1999; mazhari et al.
2001; weerapura et al. 2002; lu et al. 2003). the data on
the effects of kcne2 on drug binding are equally mixed.
kcne2 increases the sensitivity of herg for propranolol
(dupuis et al. 2005). in addition, kcne2 has been reported
to increase herg sensitivity to e4031, and increase the
rate at which use dependence develops (abbott et al.
1999). conversely, using a different voltage clamp protocol,
kcne2 was shown to have no effect on e4031 binding
(weerapura et al. 2002). the differences in the voltage
protocols used to study e4031 sensitivity suggest that
kcne2 alters herg conformations. when the protocol
involves holding the channel mainly in the open state
(0 mv) then briefly stepped to −110 mv for 25 ms, there
is no difference in the rate of development or the degree of
e4031 block whether kcne2 is present or not (weerapura
et al. 2002). in contrast, when the holding potential is
−80 mv (i.e. the channel is held in the closed state) and
stepped to +20 then −40 mv then there is a significant
difference in the rate of development and the affinity of
e4031 for herg in the presence of kcne2 (abbott et al.
1999). this suggests that kcne2 does not affect e4031
access to the binding site in the open state, but does modify
access of e4031 to the drug binding site in the closed state.
the orientation of the binding site residues will be different
in the open and closed states of the channels, so the affinity
for closed and open states should be different.
not all herg drug affinities appear to be affected by the
presence of kcne2. there are several binding sites in the
herg channels, and kcne2 may not enable access to all
of this sites. in addition, some drugs have more restrictive
requirements for a binding site. drugs which are reported
to have no change in affinity by kcne2 include local
anaesthetics (friederich et al. 2004), sulfamethoxazole
(park et al. 2003), terfenadine (scherer et al. 2002) and
 xxxd3507xxx  (kamiya et al. 2001). terfenadine interacts
with y652 and f656, but not the binding sites deeper

within the pore v625,  xxxg648xxx  and t623 (mitcheson et al.
2000).  xxxd3507xxx  interacts with  xxxg648xxx , f656 and v659
located in the s6 domain and t623, s624 and v625 located
at the base of the pore helix (kamiya et al. 2001).
in summary, the interaction between herg and kcne2
remains a subject of current research. however, kcne2
appears to alter accessibility to the binding site for some
drugs, by enabling binding to the closed state.

conclusions
ancillary subunits strongly modulate open channel block
by drugs as well as modifying basic alpha-subunit gating. this
subunit-specific pharmacology suggests that drugs that are
targeted to specific alpha-subunits in specific organs can be
made more specific by considering the characteristics of
associated subunits found in these tissues. furthermore,
the kinetic differences in gating and the corresponding
differences in drug use dependence suggest that the
response of channels to a drug will depend on the
patterns of electrical activity of a particular organ or cell
type, providing the opportunity for additional specificity
of action or reduction in side-effects. however, the
drug-modifying properties of some subunits may be
very limited. drugs which change the structure of the
binding site may alter the pharmacological profile of a
channel in a qualitative as well as quantitative fashion.
conversely, subunits which act primarily by changing
binding site access time, may not confer altered specificity,
but may just raise or lower the apparent degree of
channel inhibition at a specific concentration or pattern
of electrical activity. changing the relationship between
drug binding and conformational changes should strongly
alter use-dependent properties and may confer specific
inhibitory action to abnormal electrical behaviour, such
as seizures or arrhythmias. better understanding of the
molecular properties of drug–subunit interactions will
help in the development of organ-specific pharmacological
therapies, and the reduction of adverse side-effects
associated with current pharmacological interventions.
