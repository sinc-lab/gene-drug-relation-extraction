abstract. aspirin is a salicylate drug that is extensively used
for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and antithrombotic effects. more recently, it has been shown to
decrease the incidence of cancers of epithelial origin. in most
cases, aspirin is relatively safe. however, it does cause a host
of adverse effects and toxicities, including gastrointestinal
bleeding, ulcerations, nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity
reactions. although the inhibition of cyclooxygenases by aspirin,
which leads to its anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties, has
been well studied, the mechanisms involved in its chemopreventive effects as well as some of its adverse effects are as yet
ill-defined. studies over the past decades suggest that, besides
cyclooxygenases, aspirin acetylates other cellular proteins.
these studies used radiolabeled 3h or 14c aspirin, the only
approach used to date for the detection of proteins acetylated
by aspirin. in a recent study using protein-specific anti-acetyl
lysine antibodies and immunological methods, we demonstrated the ability of aspirin to acetylate the tumor suppressor
protein p53. in this review, we present current research from
the literature on the aspirin-induced acetylation of proteins.
we also describe an immunological approach to detecting
acetylated proteins in aspirin-treated cells, and demonstrate
that multiple proteins are acetylated. since post-translational
modification of proteins, such as acetylation, may lead to the
alteration of their function, it is possible that some of the hitherto
unexplained beneficial or adverse effects of aspirin could occur
as a result of these modifications. the identification of these
novel acetylation targets of aspirin represents a new area for
investigation.

1. introduction
aspirin ( xxxd234xxx  or asa) is currently one of the
most frequently used drugs in the world. it is well known
that use of aspirin prevents pain, inflammation and fever
(1). aspirin is also widely used for its anti-thrombotic and
cardioprotective properties, while more recent studies have
indicated its potential use in chemoprevention (2,3). aspirin
consists of acetyl and salicylate moieties, both of which have
their own individual targets. while the salicylate group has
been implicated in the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin
via the inhibition of nf-kappa b (4-6), the acetyl group causes the
inactivation of cyclooxygenases (coxs) through the acetylation
of serine residues (1,7). however, it has been demonstrated that
aspirin is also able to acetylate distinct cellular components,
including proteins, hormones and nucleic acids (8).
aspirin is generally absorbed intact in the gastrointestinal
tract (9-11). as the drug circulates in the plasma, it is hydrolyzed
to the acetate ion and  xxxd3159xxx  (11). hydrolysis is enhanced
during passage through the liver and other organs. using
radiolabeled 3h or 14c aspirin, it was shown that aspirin acetylates proteins in vitro and in vivo through a transacetylation
reaction (8,12-15). however, detailed study on its ability to
acetylate cellular proteins has not been carried out, as there is a
lack of sensitive techniques. one major problem with the use of
radiolabeled 3h or 14c aspirin in determining the acetylation of
proteins is that the absolute amount of radioactivity transferred
to the protein is relatively small and difficult to quantify due to
the low specific activity of the radioactive aspirin (16). in this
review, we provide an up-to-date account of the literature on
the effects of aspirin on the acetylation of cellular proteins,
and discuss an immunological approach for the detection of
acetylated proteins in aspirin-treated cells.
2. acetylation of cyclooxygenases by aspirin
cyclooxygenases (coxs) catalyze the rate-limiting step in the
synthesis of prostaglandins. all cox enzymes are homodimers and membrane-bound heme-containing glycoproteins

534

alfonso et al: acetylation of cellular proteins by aspirin

primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (1). cox has
both peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities. aspirin has
been shown to selectively acetylate the hydroxyl group of a
serine residue at position 530, located 70 amino acids from
the c-terminus of the cox-1 enzyme (1,7). acetylation of
cox-1 results in irreversible inhibition of its activity, thus
a new enzyme must be synthesized for more prostanoids to
be produced. acetylation of cox-1 at serine 530 inhibits its
cyclooxygenase but not its peroxidase activity. the stoichiometry of this reaction is 1:1, with one acetyl group transferred
per enzyme monomer of this dimeric protein (1,17). cox-1
and -2 contain an overall homology of 60% between their
amino acid structures, and aspirin binds to serine 516 in the
active site of cox-2 in the same way as it binds to serine 530
in the active site of cox-1. due to the presence of a slightly
larger active site in cox-2, the degree of inhibition is reported
to be much lower than in cox-1 (17). inactivation of these
enzymes leads to decreased synthesis of prostaglandins, which
are responsible for pain and fever.
3. acetylation of human  xxxg124xxx  by aspirin
human  xxxg124xxx  (hsa) is the most abundant plasma
protein, comprising approximately half of the blood serum
protein. it is a soluble protein that is produced by the liver and
is mainly involved in the transport of biomolecules, such as
hormones,  xxxd2154xxx  and various drugs. pinckard et al
demonstrated that aspirin acetylates hsa under physiological
conditions in vitro (8). this was also confirmed to occur in vivo
by a separate study (13). the acetylation of hsa by aspirin
in vivo and in vitro enhanced its capacity to bind a marker
anion, acetrizoate (18), suggesting that this protein modification
alters its conformation. the modification has been reported to
result in the formation of n-acetyl derivatives, with the epsilon-amino
group of lysine being considered a probable site of this action
(8,16,18). it was shown that sera from rheumatic patients who
had received extensive aspirin therapy contained anti-acetylated
 xxxg124xxx  antibodies (14,19,20), suggesting that aspirininduced acetylation of proteins could trigger immune responses.
aspirin also appears to inhibit the glycation of albumin
through rapid acetylation in vivo and in vitro (21), indicating
that it can interfere with protein functions, including ligand
binding properties (18).
4. acetylation of fibrinogen and platelet proteins by aspirin
fibrinogen is a soluble plasma glycoprotein produced by the
liver that is converted to fibrin by the  xxxg745xxx  thrombin
during the coagulation cascade. in addition to its anti-platelet
effect, occurring as a result of the inhibition of cyclooxygenases,
aspirin has been shown to have hypoprothrombinemic and
fibrinolytic effects (22). it was revealed that aspirin acetylates
fibrinogen in vitro (8) and in vivo (22) to form epsilon-n-acetyl-lysine
derivatives. an average of three acetyl substitutions were
observed to occur on each fibrinogen molecule, and the
n-acetylation of the lysine residues of fibrinogen by aspirin
appeared to be involved in the increased susceptibility of fibrin
clots to lysis (22). aspirin at micromolar concentrations has
also been shown to acetylate an 85-kda protein in platelets
localized to the particulate fraction. this reaction was correlated
with the inhibition of platelet function (16).

5. acetylation of other proteins and biomolecules by aspirin
aspirin has also been shown to acetylate proteins and biomolecules such as hemoglobin, dna, rna and histones, as well as
several plasma constituents, including hormones and enzymes
(8). best characterized of these is the hemoglobin molecule
(hba and hbs), which was demonstrated to be modified in
in vivo and in vitro reactions (10,23,24). both · and ß chains
were shown to be acetylated by aspirin, and the identified sites
included ßlys-59, ßlys-144 and ßlys-90 (25); however, another
study showed the primary target to be ßlys-82 (26). although
there were claims that this modification increases the oxygen
affinity of hbs (24), other reports could not substantiate this
finding (27,28). as observed with hsa, the glycation of hemoglobin was inhibited by aspirin, though the required dose was
considerably higher (21).
there is also evidence for the modification of erythrocyte
and platelet membrane proteins by aspirin, which induces local
conformational changes in these membranes (29). another
study revealed that aspirin at micromolar concentrations
acetylated rbc membrane peptides (30). elsewhere, aspirin
was shown to acetylate renal cortical and medullary proteins
after in vivo administration (15). this acetylation of proteins
was rapid and increased the half-life of these proteins to more
than 130 h. there is also a study that demonstrated the ability
of aspirin to acetylate ubiquitin in vitro (31).
aspirin is reported to have a protective effect against the
development of cataracts. implicated in this anti-cataract
effect is the acetylation of lens á-crystallins, shown to be
caused by aspirin (32,33). both the lysyl and cysteinyl residues
of bovine á-crystallins were demonstrated to be acetylated
by aspirin (33). non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins is a
secondary complication in diabetes mellitus. therefore, it was
postulated that acetylation of these proteins by aspirin could
reduce the progress of secondary biochemical lesions (21,34).
in other studies, in vivo administration of radiolabeled 3h or
14c aspirin showed that the acetyl group of aspirin bound to
several proteins, glycoproteins and lipids of the glandular and
non-glandular regions of the stomach, kidney, liver and, to a
lesser degree, bone marrow (12). this clearly demonstrated the
ability of the actetyl group to reach distant organs where sideeffects are manifested. therefore, it is argued that the high
degree of acetylation of these biomolecules may be related to
the development of some of the adverse effects of aspirin.
6. acetylation of p53 by aspirin
in a recent study, we demonstrated that aspirin at the physiologically achievable concentration of 100 µm acetylates the
tumor suppressor protein p53 (35). p53 is a key regulator of
apoptosis, and is acetylated at several defined sites by cellular
acetyltransferases in response to various stresses, including
dna damage. the ability of aspirin to acetylate p53 was demonstrated in immunoblotting experiments using commercially
available anti-acetyl p53 antibodies specific for the recognition
of acetylated lysine at position 382 (k382). increased acetylation of p53 by aspirin was correlated with increased p53 dna
binding activity and the expression of two of its target genes,
 xxxg418xxx , a protein involved in cell cycle arrest, and bax, a mitochondrial pro-apototic protein (35). p53 contains a total of 20
lysine residues. it is not at present clear how many of these

figure 1. aspirin induces the acetylation of p53 in vitro. (a) bacterially
expressed recombinant p53 (r-p53) (5 ng) was incubated in the absence
(control) or presence of aspirin at 100 µm or 2.5 mm as indicated for 24 h at
room temperature. the samples were immunoblotted by probing with antiacetyl p53 antibody (cell signaling inc.) specific for the recognition of
acetylation at lys 382. protein bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. (b) the blot in a was stripped and reprobed with anti-p53
antibody (loading control).

lysine residues, besides k382, are acetylated by aspirin (35).
in view of previous reports on the ability of aspirin to acetylate proteins through a transacetylation reaction (8,12-15), it
is likely that aspirin targets multiple lysine residues on p53.
consistent with this notion, we observed that the incubation of
purified recombinant p53 with low (100 µm) as well as high
(2.5 mm) concentrations of aspirin resulted in p53 acetylation at lysine 382 (fig. 1a), confirming the occurrence of a
non-enzymatic transacetylation reaction. it is possible that p53
acetylation by aspirin may have significant consequences on
the ability of p53 to modulate its target gene expression. the
battery of p53-regulated genes comprises more than 150 genes,
including those which induce growth arrest, stimulate dna
repair, and regulate apoptosis and anti-angiogenic proteins
(36). the ability of aspirin to acetylate p53 in cell cultures
as well as in vitro is a very important observation in view of
its chemopreventive properties. it remains to be determined
whether or not the anticancer properties of aspirin occur as a
result of the acetylation of p53 and the subsequent activation
of its target genes.
7. aspirin acetylates multiple cellular proteins
the ability of aspirin to acetylate p53 (35) suggests that under
similar conditions aspirin may target other acetylable cellular
proteins. here, we present a new approach for the detection of
proteins acetylated by aspirin in cells. we carried out immunoblotting experiments to detect proteins acetylated by aspirin
using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody specific for the recognition
of acetylated lysine residues. since the liver is one of the first
tissues to come into contact with intact aspirin following oral

figure 2. aspirin acetylates multiple cellular proteins. (a) concentrationdependent protein acetylation by aspirin in wb cells. wb liver epithelial
cells were grown as previously described (38). cells were left untreated or
treated for 8 h with different concentrations of aspirin as indicated. proteins
were run on an 8% sds-page and immunoblotted with anti-acetyl lysine
antibody (cell signaling inc.). protein bands were detected using enhanced
chemiluminescence. (b) the blot in a was stripped and reprobed with antiß-actin antibody (loading control). similar results were obtained in multiple
cell lines.

ingestion (10,11,37), a rat liver normal epithelial cell line (38)
was used. cells were treated with different concentrations
(0.25-5 mm) of aspirin for 8 h, and lysates were prepared and
immunoblotted with anti-acetyl lysine antibody. we chose
to use these concentrations of aspirin in view of the use of
similar concentrations by previous investigators, ranging
from 0.2 mm to 5 mm or much higher (10,24,39-42). fig. 2a
shows that aspirin induced the acetylation of few proteins at
0.25 mm (lane 2); however, increasing amounts of acetylated
proteins were detected at higher concentrations (lanes 5-10).
as a loading control, the blot shown in fig. 2a was stripped
and reprobed with anti-ß-actin antibody. fig. 2b shows that
all lanes contained similar amounts of ß-actin. these results
clearly demonstrate that aspirin acetylates multiple proteins in
a dose-dependent fashion. although the profile and intensity
of acetylated proteins as detected by the anti-acetyl lysine
antibody at concentrations such as 250 µm are lower compared to higher concentrations, we observed the acetylation
of specific proteins at lower aspirin concentrations (100 µm)
in immunoblots probed with protein (p53)-specific anti-acetyl
lysine antibodies (35). this suggests the increased sensitivity
of this immunoblotting technique with protein-specific antiacetyl lysine antibodies. acetylation of multiple proteins was
also observed in colon (ht-29), lung (a549), breast (mdamb-231), skin (sk-mel-5) and liver (hepg2) cancer cell
lines, as well as in primary cultures of normal human hepatocytes (unpublished data). treatment of cells with  xxxd3159xxx 
alone failed to induce protein acetylation, suggesting that the
acetyl group of aspirin is required for the observed effects.

alfonso et al: acetylation of cellular proteins by aspirin

8. summary
aspirin is a systemic agent that has both beneficial and adverse
effects throughout the body. its beneficial effects include its
analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic/cardioprotective
and potential chemopreventive properties. however, despite
these beneficial effects, it can cause fatal gastrointestinal
bleeding, hemorrhagic strokes, nephrotoxicity, and adverse
effects on the central nervous system (tinnitus). the plasma of
aspirin-treated patients has been shown to contain antibodies
against acetylated albumin. this is sometimes associated with
a number of untoward immunological reactions. moreover,
aspirin-intolerant patients are characterized by asthma,
rhinitis and nasal polyps (13), suggesting that the adverse
effects of aspirin include imbalances in immunological
reactions. aspirin is used as a therapeutic agent at various
concentrations; therefore, it is likely that the long-term effect
of even lower doses of repeatedly administered aspirin may
lead to the acetylation of proteins having a longer half life.
the molecular mechanisms by which aspirin exerts its chemopreventive properties, as well as some of its adverse effects,
are not clearly understood. the ability of aspirin to acetylate
multiple proteins as demonstrated in fig. 2, in combination
with previous reports, suggests that the acetylation of proteins
may be a major factor involved in some of the unexplained
effects of aspirin. the identification of these novel targets and
their functions may provide improved insight into the hitherto
unknown actions of this drug.
