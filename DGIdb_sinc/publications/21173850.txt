abstract
cancer pain and chronic non-malignant pain can be difficult to manage and may not respond
satisfactorily to standard analgesics. sequential empiric analgesic trials are usually done to manage
individual patients. experimental human pain models have helped to clarify mechanisms of opioid and
adjuvant analgesic actions. combinations of opioids and adjuvant analgesics better relieve pain than
either opioids or adjuvant analgesics alone, as demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. the
analgesic activity of antidepressants is largely dependent upon norepinephrine reuptake and activation
of alpha 2 adrenergic receptors. corticosteroids reduce postoperative orthopedic incident pain,
which may allow patients to ambulate earlier and with less pain. spinal corticosteroids reduce lower
hemibody pain. gabapentinoids as single high doses reduce postoperative pain and certain acute pain
syndromes. individuals who experience flares of pain while on spinal opioids benefit from intrathecal
boluses of levobupivicaine or sublingual ketamine. interventional approaches to pain management are
often necessary due to the limitations of systemic analgesics. electronics stimulators (peripheral,
spinal and motor cortex) improve difficult to manage chronic pain syndromes. pulsed radiofrequency
reduces pain without tissue damage, which could be an advantage over chemical or radiofrequency
neurotomy. botulinum toxin a reduces focal neuropathic pain that is durable. interventional related
successes in relieving pain are operator dependent. most reported benefits of systemic and regional
analgesics and interventional approaches to pain relief are not based on randomized trials and are
subject to selection bias, sampling error, and placebo responses, which may over-inflate reported
benefits. randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm reported benefits.

introduction and context
the management of pain is a complex problem. cancerrelated pain, post-operative pain, and painful flares of
chronic pain are difficult to treat. however, pain
management is a fundamental human right and so
clinicians need to be knowledgeable about analgesics
and interventional approaches to pain management [1].
single-agent analgesics are frequently ineffective and
analgesic rotation or combinations are prescribed with
little evidence of additive or synergistic benefits [2];
multiple adjuvant analgesics are frequently used with
opioids without strong evidence as to effectiveness [3-6].
evidence for benefits in neuropathic pain is often based

on disease-oriented trials but recent research is starting to
focus on pathophysiologic mechanisms of action of
analgesics [7,8].
the clinical benefits of analgesics are difficult to evaluate.
confounders such as baseline pain variability, emotional
state and associated disease-related symptoms bias
outcomes [9]. placebo responses are substantial, overinflating analgesic response in single arm studies and
diminishing anticipated benefits in randomized studies.
frequently, individuals with chronic pain have several
pains, one of which responds better to an analgesic than
the other(s).

recent advances
analgesic management of pain

experimental pain models involve acute skin, nasal, and
dental mucosa pain, muscle pain, diffuse noxious
inhibitory control (dnic), and hyperalgesia/central
sensitization. pain intensity, location, frequency, and
duration are controlled in these models to limit
confounders and better explore analgesic responses to
pain mechanisms. these models are valuable tools for
characterizing analgesic actions beyond pharmacodynamic information derived from receptor or channel
interactions [10]. using these models, staahl and
colleagues [11] recently reported a systematic review
of non-opioid analgesic responses in human experimental pain. aspirin improved acute pain, was ineffective in ischemic muscle pain but, interestingly, improved
hyperalgesia and central sensitization. ibuprofen had
the same spectrum of activity, including reduction
of mechanical hyperalgesia. in contrast, n-methyl
d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonists did not reduce
acute pain but did reduce muscle pain and secondary
hyperalgesia. gabapentin was not effective in acute pain
but blocked hyperalgesia. gabapentin did not enhance
dnic whereas lamotrigine did but did not relieve
cutaneous hyperalgesia. tricyclic antidepressants
reduced acute pain and visceral pain but did not enhance
dnic.
delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol was found to be not
effective in acute pain or hyperalgesia. smoked cannabis,
which contains several cannabis analogues, reduced
spontaneous pain from intradermal capsaicin. a recent
study reported that the combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) and cannabidiol was more effective in
relieving cancer pain than thc alone [12]. hence,
cannabis combinations and  xxxg18xxx   xxxg480xxx  agonists
should be explored further in clinical trials. combinations may improve pain and/or diminish side effects,
thus extending the thc therapeutic index.
several recent studies have demonstrated benefits from
combinations of opioids and adjuvant analgesics, which
produce superior pain control compared to single
analgesics even though the maximum tolerable doses of
both drugs are less in combination. effective combinations include oxycodone plus pregabalin [13], morphine
plus gabapentin [14] and nortriptyline plus gabapentin
[15]. the mechanisms behind the added benefits are
not known but presumably are due to complementary
receptor interactions that diminish pain or reduce opioid
analgesic tolerance. it is speculated that gabapentin and
pregabalin block calcium channels that are upregulated
by opioids [16]. gabapentin requires activated 5ht3
(serotonin) receptors for analgesia [17,18].

http://f1000.com/reports/medicine/content/2/63

the choice of antidepressants for chronic pain is
clinically important [19]. tricyclic antidepressants have
greater evidence for benefit in acquired pain processing
disorders (neuropathic pain, headaches, low back pain,
fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome) while
newly developed selective serotonin and norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors have less supportive evidence.
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are generally
ineffective. overall adrenergic (alpha-2-adrenergic)
receptor activation is more important to antidepressant
analgesic activity than activation of serotonin receptors.
there is good evidence that alpha-2-adrenoceptors mediate inhibitory descending brain stem control over dorsal
horn nociceptive traffic and that the serotonin 5ht3
receptor facilitates dorsal horn nociceptive processing
[20]. pain processing disorders such as fibromyalgia and
irritable bowel syndrome are putatively the result of
endogenous central monoamine imbalances, which cause
the brainstem nociceptive modulator to malfunction. this
may be the reason why antidepressants that selectively
reduce serotonin reuptake are less effective adjuvant
analgesics and be why norepinephrine is the important
monoamine when dampening pain processing [18].
dexamethasone reduces pain in several clinical scenarios. preoperative dexamethasone (40 mg) selectively
reduces dynamic (incident) pain after total hip replacement [21]. the benefits were quite dramatic. incident
pain in this study was reduced to 2.7 (95% confidence
interval 2.2-3.1) in the numerical rating scale (nrs)
score (0 = no pain, 10 = severe pain) compared to no
response (nrs 6.8) with placebo (95% confidence
interval 6.4-7.2; p < 0.0001). rest pain and cumulative
morphine doses, however, were not reduced. postoperative nausea was also less with dexamethasone,
which is an additional benefit. ambulation after hip
replacement is limited by incident pain; dexamethasone
appears to facilitate early mobilization and may reduce
hospital stay. both outcomes need to be included in a
confirmatory trial before this becomes routine practice.
a second study involved 10 individuals with intractable
lower hemibody cancer pain. weekly intrathecal betamethasone (2 mg) produced analgesia quickly (within
30 minutes). half of the individuals had pain relief lasting
7 days [22]. repeat intrathecal injections  xxxd2274xxx -day intervals
may be clinically problematic unless an intrathecal
catheter is in place. analgesic tolerance to intrathecal
dexamethasone was not determined in this study.
persistent responses with repeated injections would be
an important outcome. however, in those with a short
time to live (1 to 2 weeks), this may be a reasonable option
in lieu of spinal analgesia.

several studies have found that preoperative dexamethasone improves acute postoperative pain [23,24]. however, this is not observed in all studies [25]. the
mechanism by which dexamethasone improves postoperative analgesia is not well understood. morphine
increases central nervous system glutamate levels and
dexamethasone increases glutamate transporter expression, which increases glutamate clearance from synaptic
clefts [26-28]. hence, dexamethasone appears to acutely
reduce morphine analgesic tolerance or blunt counteropioid responses. it would be of interest to know if
cerebrospinal fluid glutamate levels are reduced by
dexamethasone in morphine-tolerant individuals.
gabapentinoids reduce postoperative pain after craniotomy [29]. the opioid sparing effects of preoperative
gabapentin (doses range between 300 and 1200 mg) are
from 20 to 60% [30,31]. gabapentin, besides blocking
voltage-gated calcium channels, also blocks thrombospondin binding to alpha-2-delta-1 calcium channel
subunits, which are responsible for synaptogenesis and
excitatory synapse formation [32]. preventing excitatory
synapse formation and pain-induced neuroplasticity will
reduce long-term postoperative pain syndromes (postmastectomy pain and post-thoracotomy pain). the
effective dose and duration of gabapentin treatment to
achieve these benefits are not known but should be
explored. gabapentin also reduces acute zoster pain and
allodynia with a single dose of 900 mg [33]. at least in
certain clinical settings gabapentin produces a rapid
response.
rarely do spinal opioids completely relieve pain but this
may be due to patient selection. in general, individuals
considered for spinal analgesia are highly opioidtolerant, and as a result systemic opioid doses for
transient flares of pain are less likely to be effective or
are required in high doses, leading to toxicity. mercadante and colleagues [34] reported the use of either
spinal bolus levobupivicaine or sublingual ketamine for
breakthrough pain episodes. individuals in the study
were treated by spinal analgesia (local anesthetics,
clonidine, and morphine) and experienced unacceptable
side effects and/or little pain relief from systemic
morphine (mean dose 36 mg) for pain flares. spinal
bolus levobupivicaine (mean dose 1.5 mg/0.6 ml)
through a side port or sublingual ketamine (25 mg)
reduced pain severity by 50% within 5 minutes of
administration. leg weakness was seen in 10% of
episodes treated with spinal levobupivicaine. one
individual experienced a pleasant sensation of dreaming
with ketamine. one cannot exclude a placebo response
since this was a case series and not a randomized blinded
controlled trial. there is very little published experience

http://f1000.com/reports/medicine/content/2/63

on how to manage pain flares on spinal opioids, but for
the present time, until better evidence becomes available,
mercadante and colleagues have given us an approach to
managing this rare but difficult clinical scenario.
interventional approaches to pain management
electronic stimulators

transcutaneous nerve, spinal cord, and motor cortex
stimulators have been used to reduce chronic pain that is
poorly responsive to systemic analgesics. short-term high
frequency and low frequency transcutaneous nerve
stimulators were used by 24 individuals who suffered
from chronic pain secondary to spinal cord injury [35].
patients used short bursts of high frequency (80 hz) or
low frequency (2 hz) stimulation three times daily for
2 weeks. crossover was performed after a 2-week period.
pain relief (measured using a five point global relief
scale) was reported in 29% of patients on high frequency
and 38% on low frequency stimulation. no improvement was observed in mood, coping, life satisfaction,
sleep quality, and psychosocial pain. of the 24 patients,
6 elected to continue with transcutaneous nerve stimulation. comparison to usual care would have been helpful
when assessing benefits of transcutaneous nerve stimulation in this population. one cannot exclude a placebo
response.
there is little published experience of the long-term
benefits of peripheral nerve stimulators, but a study on
long-term benefits was reported by van calenbergh and
colleagues [36]. of 11 individuals treated since the
1980s, 5 were re-examined for pain and studied using
quantitative sensory testing. pain intensity was still
reduced by stimulators and unpleasantness improved
(as measured by the visual analogue scale [vas] and
verbal rating scale). the stimulator had a continued
benefit to sleep and physical function. quantitative
sensory testing found no change in cold or heat
thresholds whether the stimulator was on or off. this
study demonstrates long-term benefits in a subset of
patients on transcutaneous nerve stimulators; in addition, tachyphylaxis to pain responses (analgesic tolerance) may not occur.
spinal cord stimulators have been used for complex
regional pain syndromes, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, pain from peripheral vascular disease,
and low back pain. a small series of patients who had
cervical neck pain after back surgery underwent cervical
epidural stimulator placement by percutaneous thoracic
needle directed implantation [37]. this was successfully
performed in four of five eligible individuals. pain over
the neck and upper extremities was reduced by 70-90%
in this small group of individuals and pain responses

f1000 medicine reports 2010, 2:63

were durable up to 9 months. these patients are not
usual candidates for regional analgesia and were likely to
have been opioid-tolerant. this procedure may be
considered in those individuals whose pain does not
respond to systemic analgesics and in whom spinal
analgesia is not possible.
spinal cord stimulators will improve complex regional
pain syndromes if the segment of body area involved
with pain is small. spinal cord stimulators cannot
adequately treat large body segments affected by regional
pain. velasco and colleagues [38] reported the use of
motor cortex stimulators in managing complex regional
pain syndrome. five individuals underwent a small
craniotomy and unilateral 20 grid contact implantation
on the motor cortex, guided by craniometric landmarks.
pain and sympathetic symptoms (perspiration, regional
temperature, skin color, and swelling) were evaluated
over 1 year using standard instruments. four of five
individuals had improvement in pain, sensory, and
sympathetic symptoms. vas and mcgill pain questionnaire scores improved significantly. this procedure
requires neurosurgical expertise and should be limited
to high volume, experienced institutions. the benefits to
this small group of individuals appear to be substantial
and durable.
a second study reported the use of motor cortex
stimulation to treat peripheral neuropathy refractory to
usual management [39]. sixteen individuals with a
variety of peripheral neuropathies (trigeminal neuralgia,
brachial plexopathy, ambulation-related pain, neurofibromatosis, herpetic ophthalmicus, atypical facial pain,
and traumatic nerve trunk injury) underwent implantation of quadrupolar leads under radiological guidance.
the epidural cortical stimulator location was secondarily
confirmed by electrophysiologic studies. the stimulator
was switched on and off at monthly intervals and
patients were assessed by the brief pain inventory, vas
for pain severity, and mcgill pain questionnaire.
thirteen individuals underwent âonâ and âoff â stimulation
assessment. the scores on the mcgill pain questionnaire
pain rating index and sensory subscore improved with
stimulation. the effects appeared to linger during the âoff â
stimulation month. the median vas pain score
decreased by 48% (individual range 0-95%).
anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is one way
of non-invasively stimulating the motor cortex. antal
and colleagues [40] used this method to treat chronic
pain syndromes, including trigeminal neuralgia, poststroke pain, back pain, and fibromyalgia. twelve patients
underwent both anodal and sham stimulation and nine
underwent either anodal or sham stimulation. current

http://f1000.com/reports/medicine/content/2/63

was applied to the âhandâ area of the m1 cortex for 20
minutes using 1 ma current for 5 consecutive days. the
crossover was randomized, double blinded, and
occurred at 6 weeks only if the vas for pain severity
returned to baseline 10 days prior to the next anodal
stimulation (or sham stimulation). this was done to
avoid a carryover analgesic effect. vas was rated daily for
1 month before, during, and after stimulation. anodal
direct current stimulation was superior to sham stimulation and lasted 3-4 weeks after stimulation was finished.
no patient experienced severe adverse effects. the
mechanism of action postulated by the investigators is
a decrease in intracortical inhibition and increased
 xxxd1751xxx -cortical excitability. activation of the motor
cortex produces long-lasting inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus [41-43]. the subthalamic nuclei project to
ventral thalamus. the dorsal subnucleus reticularis
dorsalis contains neurons involved in the convergence
of widespread nociceptive signals [44,45]. hence, longterm inhibition of the subthalamic nuclei may be the
mechanism of analgesia in this case by dampening
thalamic nociceptive traffic and blocking nociceptive
convergence.
pulsed radiofrequency

pulsed radiofrequency involves short bursts of radiofrequency energy applied to nervous tissue. unlike
continuous radiofrequency ablation, it produces little
tissue destruction but lasting inhibition of evoked
synaptic activity [46]. pulsed radiofrequency induces
cellular distress as measured by expression of neuron
activation transcription factor-3 (atf-3), and both c and
a delta sensory fibers appear to be selectively targeted by
it [47]. ultrastructural changes include abnormal membranes and mitochondria morphology and disrupted
and disorganized microfilaments and microtubules [48].
ultrastructural changes are greater in c fibers than a beta
fibers.
splanchnic pulsed radiofrequency has been used to treat
chronic benign pancreatic pain [49]. pancreatic pain is
poorly responsive to pancreatic enzyme supplements,
systemic analgesics, anti-oxidants, surgical drainage, and
celiac block. percutaneous splanchnic block may be
more successful than celiac block due to a more
predictable anatomy. blocks using alcohol or phenol
can cause cardiac arrhythmia or paralyze the diaphragm.
continuous radiofrequency ablation of the splanchnic
nerve produces good analgesic responses in 40% of
individuals. the authors reported excellent responses in
individuals using pulsed radiofrequency splanchnic
blocks. the relative lack of tissue destruction and the
avoidance of alcohol potentially make this procedure
safer than standard approaches. however, randomized

trials comparing this technique to conventional interventional approaches will need to be done to confirm
these results.
occipital neuralgia produces paroxysmal non-throbbing,
stabbing pain in the area of the greater and lesser occipital
nerve, with most episodes (85%) being unilateral.
vanelderen and colleagues [50] used pulsed radiofrequency as a means of reducing the pain intensity from
occipital neuralgia. patients were chosen for this singlearm study based on response to bupivicaine injections
into the offending nerve, defined as a 50% reduction in
the vas score for pain intensity. a 23 gauge cxe-6 needle
(cotop international bv, amsterdam, the netherlands)
was used with a lesion generator (cosman rfg-1b
generator, cosman medical inc., burlington, ma; 50 hz,
0.5 v). the primary outcome was pain, quantified by vas
and likert scale. secondary outcomes were quality of life
and reduction in analgesic use. of 19 patients who
underwent pulsed radio-frequency, 13 had a 50% or
greater improvement in pain severity. the vas score was
7.5 cm at baseline, 3.5 cm at 2 months, and 3.8 cm at
6 months. daily activities improved as well as mood and
sleep disturbances. no adverse effects were noted. this
approach should be compared to local injections of
botulinum toxin a (botox), subcutaneous neurostimulation, and c1-c4 block or rhizotomy. as this was a select
group of patients, responses may have been inflated by
selection bias. however, this is a one-time procedure that
does not cause tissue damage and has durable benefits, all
of which are encouraging. the response to repeat pulsed
radiofrequency with relapse would be of interest.
lateral branch radiofrequency ablation significantly
reduces sacroiliac pain in 50% of individuals. significant
in this setting is defined as a 50% reduction in pain
severity lasting at least 6 months [51]. however, when
using pulsed radiofrequency the location of the electrode
may be critical to analgesic benefits, much more so than
with continuous radiofrequency neurotomy. in a randomized trial involving individuals with chronic postsurgical thoracic pain, pulsed radiofrequency of the dorsal
root ganglion reduced pain in over 60% of individuals
whereas pulsed radiofrequency of the intercostal nerve
and standard medical management reduced pain in 21%
and 27%, respectively (at 6 weeks). the durability of
response for those undergoing pulsed radiofrequency of
the dorsal root ganglion was greater when assessed at
3 months compared to those undergoing intercostal
nerve pulsed radiofrequency or receiving systemic analgesic [52]. hence, the benefits in response and duration
depend on where pulse radiofrequency is performed in
relation to the nerve. the optimal site appears to be at the
dorsal root ganglion.

continuous radiofrequency neurotomy

neuropathic (post-mastectomy) pain after breast cancer
surgery can be debilitating. corticosteroids have been
used with nerve blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy
to treat neuropathic pain. a small series of three patients
with post-mastectomy pain were treated with paravertebral nerve radiofrequency neurotomy combined with
corticosteroids [53]. treatment was repeated at 2-month
intervals as needed and a total of 21 procedures were
done on these three patients. all three experienced pain
relief and improved quality of life, but regional
hypoesthesia worsened slightly with treatment. the
average number of procedures per patient was seven,
which means either the response duration was short or
multiple thoracic nerves required radiofrequency neurotomy for response. the addition of corticosteroids may
or may not be beneficial and cannot be determined from
this study.
lumbar medial branch neurotomy has been used to treat
chronic low back pain. outcomes are adversely affected
by poor patient selection and inaccurate surgical
techniques [54]. a randomized trial compared lumbar
facet-joint radiofrequency neurotomy with sham neurotomy [55]. eligible individuals had back pain for more
than 6 months and a vas pain severity â¥5. of 462
individuals, 81 were eligible and randomly assigned to a
treatment group. the first evaluation was 3 months postprocedure and the primary outcome was reduction in
pain severity by vas. secondary outcomes were physical
activity, analgesic consumption and quality of life as
measured by the short form 36 (sf-36). there was no
difference in response between radiofrequency neurotomy (27%) and sham (29%), but global perceived
effects favored radiofrequency neurotomy [56]. the
authors performed two-level diagnostic intra-articular
facet joint blocks before entering patients in the study;
blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy were performed at
the offending facet(s).
a second randomized trial compared radiofrequency
neurotomy of the facet joint versus a sham procedure in
40 patients [57]. this study was double blinded and
eligible individuals had three separate positive facet
blocks with local anesthetics; a single operator did all the
blocks. primary outcomes were reduction in pain severity
by vas, relief of generalized pain, and global impression
of improvement. there was a 1.5 (out of an 11-point pain
scale) difference between radiofrequency neurotomy and
sham in favor of radiofrequency therapy. back pain and
referred pain were statistically significantly reduced to the
same degree as generalized pain. secondary outcomes
were improved with radiofrequency neurotomy. the
differences between the two studies may be related to

f1000 medicine reports 2010, 2:63

design. the requirement of responses to three separate
blocks prior to entrance in the study and a single
individual performing radiofrequency neurotomy may
have been the reasons for the responses.
a systematic review of lumbar facet joint interventions
for back pain found that the diagnostic accuracy of local
anesthetic blocks is strongly supported by evidence
(level i or ii-1) while the evidence for radiofrequency
neurotomy is level ii-2 and ii-3 (moderate) due to lower
quality of evidence [58].
radiofrequency facet joint neurotomy should be considered for those who fail to respond to direct application of long-acting corticosteroids. besides diagnostic
techniques, the experience of the operator and imaging
modality will be critical to success of radiofrequency
neurotomy [59]. the psychological make-up of the
individual will predict responses also. psychologically
vulnerable individuals (reduced life control, disturbed
mood, negative self-efficacy, catastrophizing, high anxiety, inadequacy, and poor mental health) do not
respond as well to treatment [60].
similar to lumbar facet joint radiofrequency neurotomy,
sacroiliac joint radiofrequency neurotomy has limited
evidence (level ii-3) for benefit in reducing pain [61].
the types of diagnostic tests, criteria for response,
patient groups, and block methodology, including
imaging, are also likely to be factors predicting responses
[62].
radiofrequency splanchnic neurotomy has been used to
reduce pain and analgesic consumption in those
suffering from chronic pancreatitis [63]. endoscopicguided percutaneous radiofrequency cordotomy
reduced refractory pain [64]. radiofrequency neurotomy followed by cementoplasty has been used to treat
painful malignant bone lesions in a small number of
individuals [65]; post-procedure pain severity in this
study was 4.2, which was significantly less than preprocedure levels (7.9 by vas). comparisons should be
made between cementoplasty or kyphoplasty alone
versus cementoplasty or kyphoplasty plus radiofrequency ablation in future studies.
botutinum toxin type a (botox)

fewer than 60% of individuals receive or experience
partial relief from neuropathic pain using approved
medications. in fact, the number needed to treat to
obtain a response in one individual ranges between two
and six. botox has been used for painful disorders
associated with muscular contraction (e.g., cervical
dystonia and facial spasticity) and glandular secretion

http://f1000.com/reports/medicine/content/2/63

(hyperhidrosis) [66]. acute and chronic pain syndromes
are frequently associated with muscle spasm, and preclinical evidence using the rat formalin pain model
supports the antinociceptive potential of botox. botox
injected into the same site as formalin (subplantar
surface) inhibited formalin-induced glutamate release
from sensory neurons and reduced the expression of
fos-like immunoreactive cells in the dorsal horn [67].
botox reduced the release of  xxxg2240xxx , calcitonin
gene-related protein, and  xxxd428xxx  receptors (such as
trpv1). in a case report, botox injections into the trigger
zone of individuals with trigeminal neuralgia reduce
pain [68].
botox has been used to reduce pain and improve gait in
patients with unilateral plantar fasciitis. huang and
colleagues [69] performed a randomized double-blind
controlled study in 50 individuals with unilateral
fasciitis. those randomized to botox received 50 units
in normal saline injected into the plantar fascia under
ultrasound guidance. the control group received normal
saline alone. outcomes were pain severity by vas,
plantar fascia thickness, fat pad thickness, and gait
(pressure velocity during first step loading response).
those receiving botox had a significant reduction in pain
at 3 weeks and 3 months compared to controls. fat pad
thickness was unchanged, indicating no inflammatory
responses or tissue atrophy.
forty-five individuals with myofascial pain and headaches
were enrolled in a randomized trial in which they were
randomly assigned to dry needle, 0.25% lidocaine, or
botox injections at the trigger points [70]. outcomes were
pain intensity, frequency, duration, local post-injection
sensitivity, obtainment time, duration of relief, and use of
rescue analgesics and responses were assessed at 12 weeks.
all groups responded, with botox associated with reduced
analgesic use and improved local injection sensitivity. the
authors recommended that botox be reserved for those
who do not respond to lidocaine trigger point injections
only, because of the increased cost.
ureteral stent placement is associated with pain and
urinary frequency and urgency. these symptoms may be
related to muscle spasm. gupta and colleagues [71]
performed a randomized, single blinded trial in 51
individuals undergoing ureteral stenting. botox 10 u/ml
was injected in three locations around the ureteral orifice
during stent placement in 30 individuals. pain and
urinary symptoms were assessed using the urethral stent
symptom questionnaire completed 7 days after stent
placement. botox reduced post-stent placement pain
(vas 3.4 versus 6) and opioid use. botox did not relieve
lower urinary tract symptoms.

botox injections have been compared to topical  xxxd2402xxx  in the management of pain associated
with anal fissures [72]. seventy-three individuals were
randomly assigned, of which 37 received botox. pain was
non-significantly better with  xxxd2402xxx . healing at 4 months occurred in 14 of 37 individuals who
received botox and 21 of 36 who were treated with
 xxxd2402xxx .  xxxd2402xxx  has advantages
since it is less expensive, but requires daily continuous
application. there appears to be little role for botox as
initial therapy and should be reserved for individuals
who do not respond to  xxxd2738xxx  donor therapy.
combination therapy should be tested in those with anal
fissures that fail to respond to single agent therapy.
ranoux and colleagues [73] performed a randomized
double-blinded controlled trial of botox versus placebo in
29 individuals with focal neuropathies, allodynia, and
cold intolerance. patients received a one-time intradermal injection of botox (20-190 units) into the painful
area. outcomes were average spontaneous pain severity,
quantitative thermal and mechanical perception, allodynia to brushing, neuropathic symptoms, global impression of benefit, and quality of life; these outcomes were
measured at baseline, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. botox reduced
spontaneous pain relative to placebo from weeks 2 to 14.
thermal sensation was preserved with botox injections.
botox also reduced allodynia and cold sensitivity without
altering perception thresholds. the number needed to
treat for benefit was three at 12 weeks. side effects were
transient pain at the site of injection. a single injection of
botox at the site of neuropathic pain produces durable
responses and may be less expensive than daily lidocaine
transdermal patches. this small but well conducted
randomized trial provides evidence that botox is effective
in neuropathic pain. whether this should be used after
lidocaine transdermal patches or as a substitution in the
management of focal neuropathic pain needs to be
addressed in a randomized trial.

reduces lower hemibody pain from cancer. combinations
of tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentin and gabapentinoids plus opioids improve analgesia at lower doses than
single analgesics and to a better extent. these findings will
influence dosing strategies. it is better to add a second drug
to moderate doses of an opioid, gabapentin, or tricyclic
antidepressants rather than titrate to high and perhaps
toxic doses. flares of pain with spinal analgesia unresponsive to intravenous morphine may better respond to
sublingual ketamine or spinal  xxxd2468xxx .
non-destructive minimally invasive techniques have
been developed to treat refractory pain. these include
electronic stimulations, pulsed radiofrequency, and
botox. these therapies have been creatively applied in a
small number of individuals. randomized trials are
available but participant numbers are generally limited.
on the other hand, pulsed radiofrequency and electrostimulation as well as botox have an additional element
of safety since they do not involve the risk of phenol and
alcohol injections or tissue destruction. the applications
of these techniques are operator dependent, which will
influence response rates and ultimately benefits.

implications for clinical practice
adjuvant analgesics influence the cerebral and spinal
signatures of pain perception differently [74]. combining
adjuvants and analgesics reduces acute pain, enhances
dnic and reduces central sensitization. non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) may be effective analgesics
for neuropathic pain as demonstrated in human experimental pain, animal models, and case reports [75-81].
antidepressants that block norepinephrine uptake are
likely to be more effective adjuvant analgesics than those
that inhibit serotonin reuptake. single dose dexamethasone and gabapentin improve postoperative pain. dexamethasone may be particularly effective for incident pain
after joint replacement. intrathecal betamethasone
