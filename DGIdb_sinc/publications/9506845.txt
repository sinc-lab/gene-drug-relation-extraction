abstract isothermal titration microcalorimetry has been used
to measure changes in enthalpy and heat capacity for binding of
lisinopril to the  xxxg99xxx -converting enzyme (ace; ec
3.4.15.1) and to its apoenzyme at ph 7.5 over a temperature
range of 15^30³c. calorimetric measurements indicate that
lisinopril binds to two sites in the monomer of both holo- and apoace. binding of lisinopril to both systems is enthalpically
unfavorable and, thus, is dominated by a large positive entropy
change. the enthalpy change of binding is strongly temperaturedependent for both holo- and apo-ace, arising from a large heat
capacity change of binding equal to 32.4 þ 0.2 kj/k/(mol of
monomeric holo-ace) and to 31.9 þ 0.2 kj/k/(mol of monomeric apo-ace), respectively. the negative values of vcp for
both systems are consistent with burial of a large non-polar
surface area upon binding. although the binding of lisinopril to
holo- and apo-ace is favored by entropy changes, this is more
positive for the holoenzyme. thus, the interaction between zn2 +
and lisinopril results in a higher affinity of the holoenzyme for
this drug due to a more favorable entropic contribution.

1. introduction
 xxxg99xxx -converting enzyme (ace;  xxxg36xxx ) is a
zinc metallopeptidase that plays an important role in blood
pressure regulation. ace catalyzes the hydrolysis of inactive
 xxxg99xxx  to the potent vasoconstrictor  xxxg99xxx , and
converts the vasodilator bradykinin into an inactive peptide
[1]. the involvement of ace in the metabolism of these two
vasoactive peptides has been responsible for the attention paid
to it as a target for antihypertensive drugs. one of the compounds widely used in the treatment of hypertensive disease is
lisinopril
(nk -[(s)-1-carboxy-3-phenyl]-l-lysyl- xxxd2434xxx ),
which is an inhibitor of ace. the somatic isozyme of ace
is a glycoprotein that consists of a single polypeptide chain
containing two homologous domains called the n and c domains, each bearing a potential catalytic site [2^5]. ace is
found as a membrane-bound enzyme via its hydrophobic cterminal segment and also as a circulating molecule in plasma
[6]. the latter seems to be secreted from the former by the

action of an unknown protease and shows enzymatic activity
[7], indicating that the c-terminal region of the native enzyme
is not needed for the catalytic activity [8^10]. in vitro, a soluble active form of it can be obtained from the lung enzyme by
limited proteolytic cleavage [9,11].
the three-dimensional structure of ace is still unknown,
but the crystal structures of other zinc metalloproteases have
been elucidated. although carboxypeptidase a and ace are
quite distinct structurally, both enzymes are zinc-containing
exopeptidases with some similar properties. these facts suggested that the nature of the catalytic process, and therefore
of the active sites, was similar in both cases. thus, taking into
account the analogy between the catalytic sites of the carboxypeptidase a, thermolysin and ace, potent competitive inhibitors of ace have been designed, one of them being lisinopril [12,13]. from a thermodynamic viewpoint drug design
is seen primarily as the process of optimizing speci¢c biomolecular interactions, which is achieved by the estimation of the
di¡erence between the gibbs energy of a compound in water
compared to that of the same compound bound to a speci¢c
protein receptor site. the gibbs energy changes are linked to
the enthalpy and entropy changes. thus, the knowledge of the
e¡ect of speci¢c interactions in the vh and vs³ values of
binding will provide information, which in turn can be used
in the drug design process. in order to understand the forces
driving the association between lisinopril and ace, we
studied the energetics of binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme as a function of temperature using isothermal titration
calorimetry (itc). as far as we know, this is the ¢rst time
that a calorimetric study has been carried out on ace. earlier
studies have only been focused on measuring inhibition of
ace or binding a¤nities for di¡erent drugs [5,14^18], but a
thermodynamic characterization of the binding of drugs to
ace has not been undertaken. in this work, we report on
calorimetric titration of lisinopril to ace and to its apoenzyme at four temperatures within the range 15^30³c. in both
systems, the enthalpy changes are positive within the temperature range studied and decrease linearly with the temperature, given a large negative value of vcp . the formation of
complexes between lisinopril and the holo- and apo-enzymes
is entropically driven, although the thermodynamic parameters obtained are di¡erent. those di¡erences are discussed in
terms of the possible interaction between the zinc cofactor and
the inhibitor.

trypsin treatment and size exclusion chromatography [11]. the trypsin
solubilizes the protein by deletion of a fragment of approximately 10
kda. thus, the molecular mass of the monomer was taken as 160 kda
[11]. the puri¢cation yield was around 15^20 mg of apparently pure
protein from 1 kg of bovine lung. the enzyme showed a single-band
pattern in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of  xxxd3215xxx  and showed no detectable trypsin activity.
solutions of ace were concentrated on centriprep 30 concentrators and prepared by dialysis of the enzyme against several changes of
0.3 m nacl, 50 wm zn(aco)2 , 50 mm cacodylate at ph 7.5 and 4³c.
protein concentration was determined from absorbance measurements
at 280 nm using the bovine lung enzyme absorbance coe¤cient
2.1u105 m31 cm31 [19]. the activity of lung ace was determined
by the spectrophotometric method of holmquist et al. [20] at 25³c,
with 2-furanacryloyl-l-phenylalanyl glycyl-glycine (fapgg) as substrate. reaction mixtures contained 100 mm fapgg in 50 mm
hepes, 0.3 m nacl, 10 wm zn(aco)2 and 5^12 nm ace at ph
7.5. absorbance measurements at 334 nm were carried out in a beckman du-7400 spectrophotometer with the cells maintained at 25³c.
one unit of activity is de¢ned as the amount of ace that produces a
va334 /min of 1.0. the speci¢c activity of puri¢ed enzyme was 24^26
min31 mg31 .
2.1. preparation of apo-ace
the zinc-free enzyme was prepared by dialysis of 30^84 wm ace
against seven changes of a 100-fold volume excess of edta (10 mm)
dissolved in 10 mm hepes at ph 7.5 and 4³c for 1 week. the
edta was removed by dialysis against three changes of 100-fold
volume excess of 0.3 m nacl, 50 mm cacodylate bu¡er solution at
ph 7.5 and 4³c. the speci¢c activity of the apoenzyme was less than
1% of the activity of the holoenzyme, and in the presence of zn2 the
activity is completely recovered.
all chemicals used were of the highest purity available and were
purchased from either merck or sigma. centriprep 30 concentrators
were from amicon. all solutions were degassed and clari¢ed through
a 0.45-wm millipore ¢lter immediately before use.
2.2. calorimetric experiments
itc experiments were performed in a calorimeter built in our laboratory, interfaced to a microcomputer using an a/d converter board

(data translation dt-2805) for automatic instrument control and
data collection. the characteristics of this instrument are similar to
other calorimeters, such as those described by mckinnon et al. [21]
and freire et al. [22]. the titration experiments were carried out at ph
7.5 and 14.9³c, 19.9³c, 25³c and 29.9³c, as described elsewhere
[23,24]. the protein concentrations of the solutions employed in the
calorimetric experiments were in the range 34^90 wm and 34^65 wm
for holo- and apo-ace, respectively. all the appropriate corrections
for dilution heats were applied. the thermal e¡ect of the protein
dilution was negligible in all cases. the activity of the enzyme was
routinely checked just before and after the calorimetric experiment.
the ace-lisinopril complex from calorimetric experiments showed
less than 1% activity. similarly, the ph values of the bu¡er, lisinopril,
and protein solutions were checked at each temperature before and
after the binding reaction.
2.3. analysis of calorimetric titration data
the binding of a ligand, l, to two equal and independent sites on
the protein molecule was assumed, k being its characteristic microscopic association constant, vh the molar enthalpy change of binding
and nh  the number of protons taken up by the protein-ligand complex. the heat released or absorbed for each ligand concentration is
given by the equation [24]

where [p] stands for the monomer protein concentration in the calorimeter cell, v for the reaction volume and vhi for the bu¡er ionization heat. the free ligand concentration after each injection must be

where [l]t is the total ligand concentration.
eq. 1 involves three ¢tting parameters: vh, nh  and k. if the bu¡er
ionization heat is close to zero, the last term in eq. 1 can be neglected
and, then, that equation has only two ¢tting parameters, the enthalpy
change and the association constant. once the convergence criteria are
satis¢ed, the values of those parameters can be obtained for each
temperature. a computer program for speci¢c data analysis has
been written including a function optimization based on the levenberg-marquardt algorithm [25]. heat capacity changes of binding
were obtained by measuring the enthalpy changes on association
over a temperature range of 15^30³c.

3. results and discussion

fig. 1. calorimetry titration of the binding of lisinopril to bovine
lung ace at ph 7.5 and 25³c. a: the programmed sequence consisted of 12 injections of 30 wl each of 10 mm lisinopril stock solution. the lisinopril and bu¡er solution were injected into a sample
cell containing 2.9 ml of 90.3 wm monomeric ace and a reference
cell containing 2.9 ml of bu¡er (0.3 m nacl, 50 wm zn(aco)2 , 50
mm cacodylate). the data in a are the di¡erences between the sample cell and the reference cell. b: integrated heat change for each
injection per mol lisinopril injected after subtracting the control injection is plotted vs. injection number.

3.1. binding lisinopril to holo-ace
direct calorimetric measurements were performed in order
to determine the enthalpy change for the binding of lisinopril
inhibitor to holo-ace. a typical thermogram for binding of
lisinopril to monomeric ace in cacodylate bu¡er at ph 7.5
and 25³c is shown in fig. 1. cacodylate bu¡er was chosen for
its small ionization heat of approximately 31.25 kj/mol [26].
thus, the thermal e¡ects of possible bu¡er protonation or
ionization must be almost negligible. however, the heat measured might include a possible contribution due to the heat
induced by proton uptake or release from the ligand-protein
complex. for the titration of ace there are 12 consecutive
equivalent 30 wl injections (spaced at 4 min intervals) of a
lisinopril solution into the enzyme solution. the positive
sign of the measured heat indicates that the enthalpy change
for each injection was positive and that the process of binding
under these conditions was endothermic. control experiments
involved the same number of 30 wl injections of inhibitor
solution into the same bu¡er but without enzyme present.
control injections represent the dilution heat of lisinopril
and the heat e¡ects from non-chemical reaction sources,

which have not been compensated with dual injection into the
sample and reference cells. the negative de£ections observed
from the third injection to the end of the titration in fig. 1a
are very similar to the control injections and show that saturation has been reached in the ¢rst two injections. the area
under each peak is the heat for each injection. the integrated
heats after subtraction of the small heat of the control experiment are divided by the mol ligand injected, and the resulting
values are shown vs. injection number in fig. 1b. in the reaction cell, total enzyme and lisinopril concentrations were
89.3 wm and 109.1 wm, respectively, after the ¢rst injection.
in these conditions, a site in the monomer of enzyme would
be saturated if the association constant was higher than 106
m31 . as it is well known that the a¤nity of ace to lisinopril
is very high [14,18], the result proves that lisinopril binds to
the two potential active sites identi¢ed in the sequence of
somatic ace [5]. also it agrees with the fact that lisinopril
binds to both ileal £uid and rabbit testicle enzymes, which
have analogous sequences to the n and c domains in the
somatic enzyme [17], respectively. because the reaction of
ace with lisinopril occurs with extremely high a¤nity, no
attempt was made to obtain the equilibrium binding constants
from the calorimetric titration data, since these constants are
too large to be measured by titration microcalorimetry [27^
29]. for the tight binding process, however, this technique
allows precise measuring of the enthalpy change of binding.
the total heat of the saturation process can be calculated
from the summation of the heats involved in each injection.
the value of vh obtained at 25³c is shown in table 1. as the
enthalpy change is positive, vs³ must also be positive and the
binding process is entropy driven. the entropy change was
calculated from the vh obtained and using the value of vg³
calculated from the microscopic binding constants [17]. the
vs³ value is also displayed in table 1. the standard state is
that of 1 mol/l. the calculation of thermodynamic functions
implies the usual approximation of setting standard enthalpies
equal to the observed ones.
experiments identical to those described above were also
carried out at 14.9³c, 19.9³c and 29.9³c. in these cases saturation was also allowed on the second injection (data not
shown), and the binding enthalpy change was positive. as
the temperature increased, vh became less endothermic and
its contribution to the gibbs energy change of binding was
less unfavorable. fig. 2 shows a linear dependence of binding
enthalpy change on the temperature, and a constant heat capacity change was obtained from the slope of a linear regression analysis of vh vs. t data (table 1). as can be seen in
fig. 2, the enthalpy change decreased quickly with the temperature due to a large negative heat capacity. the binding process is accompanied by a large positive entropy change, which
also depends strongly on temperature, while vg³ will change
less than vh and vs³ with temperature because of the enthal-

py-entropy compensation. this behavior is usual in many ligand-protein interactions [24,30^32], because the binding of a
ligand to a protein is frequently accompanied by a large vcp .
the positive enthalpy change and large positive entropy
change of binding upon complex formation can be justi¢ed
by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. it is probable
that the lisinopril-ace complex has an electrostatic interaction between the zinc ion and some group from lisinopril.
electrostatic interactions correlate well with some postulated
interactions in designed inhibitors on the assumption that
ace has similar active sites to thermolysin and carboxypeptidase a [12,13]. in the spatial structure of these two related
enzymes [33^35], two histidines, one glutamate and one water
molecule coordinate the zinc ion. although the three-dimensional structure of ace has not been yet determined, the
sequence is known and corresponding residues of his and
glu are found in the n and c domains [2]. monzingo and
matthews [35] crystallized some inhibitors bound to thermolysin and found that the carboxylate of their phenylalanine is
bound to the zn2 . moreover, in the active sites of carboxypeptidase a [33] and thermolysin [35] there is an arginine,
which binds the c-terminal carboxylate of the substrate. similar interactions are possible between a carboxylate group of
lisinopril and zinc ion of ace and between an arginine residue of ace and the carboxy terminus of lisinopril. x-ray
analysis also showed a hydrogen bond between the inhibitors
and the thermolysin [35], and this interaction has also been
suggested to exist in the inhibitor-ace association [12]. however, the obtained thermodynamic parameter values seem to
indicate that hydrogen bonds do not play an important role in
the binding of lisinopril to ace. on the other hand, the

interaction between  xxxd1850xxx  groups from lisinopril and ace
requires the dehydration of both the protein and the drug and
there is an entropic gain from the transfer of interfacial water
into the bulk solvent. the aromatic groups of lisinopril may
be accommodated in a hydrophobic binding pocket similar to
that observed in the three-dimensional structure of carboxypeptidase a and thermolysin. if a signi¢cant  xxxd1850xxx  surface
area is buried at the interaction interface, the complex formation is accompanied by negative changes in the heat capacity
of the system [36^41]. as table 1 shows, the vcp for the
binding of lisinopril to holo-ace is negative and large. murphy and freire [42] and spolar and record [43] have suggested that the vcp may be described as a phenomenon in
hydration terms, pointing out that changes in vibrational
modes apparently contribute little to vcp . thus, the enthalpy
and heat capacity values provide an estimation of solvent
accessibility changes during the binding [42,44], the values
of which are still unknown since the spatial structure of
ace has not yet been determined. if we assume that the
contribution to vh and vcp of possible protonation or ionization of groups of the protein and/or ligand during binding
is almost negligible, the application of murphy's approach
[42] to the experimentally determined values (table 1) indicates that the surface area buried on complex formation comî 2 ) and
prises 70% non-polar surface (approximately 1720 a

30% polar surface (approximately 775 a ).
3.2. binding lisinopril to apo-ace
fig. 3 shows data from the calorimetric titration of 2.9 ml
of 54.3 wm monomeric apo-ace in the sample cell at 25³c
with a 8 mm solution of lisinopril, both in the same bu¡er
(0.3 m nacl, 50 mm cacodylate at ph 7.5). the sample data
represent 12 injections of 30 wl each spaced at 4 min intervals.
the ¢rst four injections are all endothermic, while the last

seven are exothermic and very similar to the control experiment, which indicates that saturation has been reached. the
integrated heats after subtraction of the small heats of the
control experiment are shown as the enthalpy per mol ligand
injected vs. injection number in fig. 3b. for this system the
shape of a calorimetric titration curve is sensitive to both the
enthalpy change and the association constant for the binding
ligand to protein. if the curve in fig. 3b is compared to that
in fig. 1b it is evident that the holoenzyme has a higher
a¤nity for lisinopril than the apoenzyme. the calorimetric
titrations were also carried out at other temperatures between
14.9 and 19.9³c and are shown in fig. 4 as curves of cumulated changes of enthalpies. therefore, any point, at a given
ligand concentration, represents the total heat obtained summing all previous heats and divided by the mol monomeric
protein. in order to calculate more accurately the heat capacity change value, the enthalpy change of the binding of
lisinopril to the apoenzyme was also determined at 30³c.
molecular biology studies of human somatic ace predict
the existence of two functional active sites in the protein
monomer [2,45] and some ace inhibitors bound to both sites
[5,15^18]. although the sequence of ace reveals a high degree of internal homology between the n and c domains [2],
the a¤nity of both sites for several inhibitors seems to be
slightly di¡erent [5,16,17]. the equilibrium constants of lisinopril to holo-ace are not equal but are of the same order of
magnitude [5,17]. we tested di¡erent binding models and the
analyses of the data in fig. 4 are consistent with a stoichiometry of two equal and non-interacting sites in the apoenzyme
for the binding of lisinopril. however, a model of two independent sets of binding sites in the monomer (two enthalpy
changes and two apparent association constants) makes it
possible to ¢t the experimental binding data, both equilibrium
constants being very close to the one obtained, which is
(2.3 þ 0.2)u104 m31 at 25³c. thus, our data allow us to
suggest that lisinopril shows close a¤nity for both sites in
the n and c domains and to determine the vh for the binding of lisinopril to monomeric apo-ace with fairly good precision. the results of the ¢tting of the experimental data for
the lisinopril-apo-ace complex, using the model to two equal
and independent sites (see section 2) are shown in fig. 4 and
the thermodynamic parameters at 25³c are summarized in

fig. 4. thermal titration of bovine lung apo-ace at ph 7.5. the
monomeric protein concentration was 34^65 wm in 0.3 m nacl
and 50 mm cacodylate. the points correspond to the total cumulative heat e¡ect in the titration process plotted as a function of the

table 1. the heat capacity change was calculated as described
before for the ligand binding to the holoenzyme (fig. 2). in
this case, a large negative vcp was also obtained (table 1).
thus, the enthalpy and entropy changes of lisinopril-apoace complex formation depend strongly on temperature in
the range 15^30³c, while vg³ changes little with temperature
because of enthalpy-entropy compensation. the large negative
vcp suggests the possibility of a decrease in the exposure of
hydrophobic groups from the ligand and the protein to water
upon binding. the association lisinopril-apoenzyme is clearly
governed by an entropic contribution at all temperatures examined. if the thermodynamic parameter values for the binding of the inhibitor to holo- and apo-ace are compared, we
can observe that the a¤nity of the ligand to the holoenzyme is
higher, since the value of k is approximately ¢ve orders of
magnitude higher. this higher a¤nity is due to a more favorable entropy change, which can be explained by electrostatic
interactions between zn2 and some negative groups of lisinopril. these interactions seem to be accompanied by a positive vh. however, an electrostatic interaction usually makes
positive contributions to vcp and our results show a heat
capacity more negative for the holoenzyme than for the
apoenzyme, which seems to suggest light changes at the neighborhood of the sites in the apoenzyme with respect to the
holoenzyme, which a¡ect their interactions with the lisinopril.
the results presented in this study show that lisinopril binds
to two sites in the somatic ace monomer. the gibbs energy
change for both holo- and apo-ace complex formation is
entropy-controlled and although the enthalpy and entropy
changes exhibit strong temperature dependence, arising from
a signi¢cant negative heat capacity change, the binding process remains dominated by entropy throughout the physiological temperature range. thus, the thermodynamic parameter
values suggest that the driving force for the binding of lisinopril to holo-ace is provided by electrostatic interactions and
hydrophobic e¡ects related to buried  xxxd1850xxx  surface with liberation of water molecules from both the protein and the
drug, showing that the hydrophobic character of the groups
in the drug is an important factor in the binding of an inhibitor to ace. the comparison between the thermodynamic
parameters for the binding of lisinopril to the holo- and the
apo-enzyme shows that the interaction between the zinc ion
and some group of lisinopril increases the a¤nity of holoenzyme for the inhibitor due to a more favorable entropic contribution.
