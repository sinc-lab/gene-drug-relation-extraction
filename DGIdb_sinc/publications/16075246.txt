pyridoxine-dependent seizures

abstract pyridoxine-dependent seizure (pds) is a rare
autosomal recessive intractable seizure disorder only controlled by a daily supplementation of pharmacological
doses of pyridoxine ( xxxd3049xxx ). although glutamate
decarboxylase utilizes  xxxd3047xxx  as a cofactor
during conversion of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate, to the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-amino butyric
acid (gaba), several studies have failed to demonstrate
a linkage to either of the glutamate-decarboxylase-encoding
genes ( xxxg849xxx  and  xxxg850xxx ) and pds excluding involvement
of this functional candidate. however, in 2000, a locus for
pds was mapped to a 5 cm interval at chromosome 5q31 in
four consanguineous and one multisib pedigree (zmax=8.43
at theta=0 for marker d5s2017) [cormier-daire et al. in am j
hum genet 67(4):991–993 2000]. we undertook molecular
genetic studies of six nonconsanguineous north american
families, using up to ten microsatellite markers to perform
haplotype segregation analysis of the 5q31 locus. assignment to the chromosome 5q pds locus was excluded in one
of the six north american pds pedigrees, as chromosome
5q31 haplotypes were incompatible with linkage to this
locus. the remaining five pds pedigrees showed haplotype
segregation consistent with linkage to 5q31, generating a
maximum combined lod score of 1.87 (theta=0) at marker

introduction
pyridoxine-dependent seizure (pds) is a very rare autosomal recessive disease with a prevalence of 1 in 400–700,000
births. pds typically presents as intractable seizures during
infancy, uncontrolled by anticonvulsants. however, following treatment with pyridoxine ( xxxd3049xxx ), all clinical and
electrophysiological evidence of seizures are abolished, thereby confirming the diagnosis. consequently, patients are
dependent on high pharmacological doses of pyridoxine for
the rest of their lives to remain seizure-free, but developmental delay, even with prompt recognition and treatment,
is usual [2, 3].
pyridoxine-dependent seizure was first reported in the
1950s by hunt et al. [4, 5]. although not completely consistent, observations of measurably low levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (gaba)
and high levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamic
acid in cerebral spinal fluid and in a postmortem brain specimen of pds patients supported contentions that pds may
result from either a block in  xxxd2431xxx  conversion to
gaba or in the metabolic recovery of gaba itself [6–9].
because the active form of pyridoxine in neurons, pyridoxal
5-phosphate (plp), is the cofactor for  xxxg913xxx  (gad) which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to
gaba, scrutiny of the genes encoding gad as candidates
for pds transpired. however, the two genes encoding the
gad isoforms ( xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx ),  xxxg849xxx  (chromosome
2q31), and  xxxg850xxx  (chromosome 10p11.23) were excluded
from playing a causal role in pds by haplotype and mutational analysis in pds pedigrees [1, 10, 11]. thereafter,
homozygosity mapping by cormier-daire et al. identified a

144

locus for pds to a chromosome, 5q31 [1], yet the causal
gene residing within this interval has yet to be identified.
interestingly, recessive loss-of-function mutations of the
 xxxg1793xxx  gene, which encodes the enzyme required for intracellular systhesis of plp, has been shown to cause
neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (nee). nee is related to
pds in that potentially fatal seizures develop within hours
of birth which are unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy.
however, nee is clearly a disorder distinct from pds, as
neonatal seizures respond to plp, but not to pyridoxine
treatment [12].
in this communication, we report the findings of a
haplotype segregation analysis, using polymorphic dna
markers from 5q31 in six pds north american families,
which establish that genetic heterogeneity is present for
pds. we report also the identification of recombination
events within classic pds pedigrees at the 5q31 locus that
may further direct candidate gene analysis for this rare
disorder.

materials and methods

neonatal seizures. while the index patient’s (ii.1) neonatal
seizures responded to pyridoxine, the diagnosis of pyridoxine dependency was in doubt until his younger brother
presented 5 years later with neonatal seizures that responded to pyridoxine. both boys have experienced rare
breakthrough seizures associated with febrile illnesses and
have motor apraxia and language delay. patient ii.1 from
kindred 3008 presented with partial motor seizures at 3 weeks
of age. pyridoxine dependency was diagnosed at 8 months of
age. he has problems with attention and language developmental delay. his younger brother presented with partial motor
seizures at 9 months of age, and due to the family history, was
diagnosed with pyridoxine dependency immediately. he is
described as developmentally normal.
patient ii.1 from kindred 3009 presented at 3 months of
age with infantile spasms. the seizures did not respond to
vigabatrin or  xxxg1801xxx  (acth), but
came under complete control at 9 months of age when daily
oral pyridoxine (200 mg) was initiated.  xxxd2274xxx  years of age,
she remains seizure-free on pyridoxine. however, she has
significant neurodevelopmental handicaps consistent with
her autistic spectrum disorder.

patients
dna microsatellite marker analysis
all affected pedigree members described in this manuscript
met criteria for diagnosis for pds defined below. pyridoxine-dependent seizure (or epilepsy) is a clinical diagnosis
and is characterized by a combination of various seizure
types usually appearing before 18 months of age. these
seizures are otherwise intractable and responsive only to
administration of pyridoxine hydrochloride, either parenteral (immediate response) or oral (within 7 days). the
dependence is permanent, and the interruption of daily
pyridoxine supplementation leads to a recurrence of seizures generally within days [online mendelian inheritance
in man (omim) 266100] [2, 3].
dna samples were extracted from peripheral blood
samples using standard methods from members of six white
north american families (see fig. 1a), each consisting of
the proband, parents, affected siblings, and unaffected
siblings. clinical details of the affected individuals are
outlined in table 1. kindreds 3001 and 3002 have been
described previously (families 3 and 2, respectively) [11].
briefly, patients in pedigrees 3001 and 3002 presented with
typical pds symptoms of neonatal onset, except for some
initial responsiveness to anticonvulsants observed for the
male in pedigree 3001 and the female in pedigree 3002.
however, by 3–8 months of age, both of these patients
required pyridoxine for seizure control. the second affected
sibling in both pedigrees (3001 and 3002) were diagnosed
with pds at initial presentation. all four patients have been
treated with pyridoxine for 7–15 years. the affected female
in kindred 3005 (ii.1) presented with mixed seizures at 2
months of age. pyridoxine dependency was confirmed at 4
months of age. she is now 4 years of age and has experienced one breakthrough seizure associated with varicella.
she has gross motor and language developmental delay.
the two affected boys in kindred 3006 presented with

the majority of patients were enrolled through a protocol
of informed consent (university of washington, human
subjects). pedigree structures are depicted in fig. 1. peripheral blood lymphocytes were harvested from patient blood,
and genomic dna was isolated using standard methods.
initial genotyping was performed using polymorphic markers
within the 5-cm critical region as defined by cormier-daire
et al. [1]. four polymorphic markers were used for the initial
linkage analysis in all six pedigrees (fig. 1a). an additional
six markers were subsequently utilized to further characterize
recombination events in two pedigrees. polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) amplicons were detected using 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-fam) fluorescence sense primers (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). after capillary electrophoresis, the results were analyzed using genotyper v. 2.5.2
software (applied biosystems). genotypes are given using
exact allele sequence lengths. haplotype segregation analysis
was performed using the pedigree drawing program cyrillic
(version 2.1; cyrillic software, oxfordshire, uk). primer
sequences can be found on the genome database (http://
www.gdb.org/).
linkage analysis
two-point lod scores were calculated between polymorphic
markers and a 5q31 pds locus using the computer program
linkage (version 5.1) [13]. lod scores (z) were calculated under a model of autosomal recessive inheritance.
disease penetrance was taken as 1.0 for this disorder, and
the frequency of the mutant allele was assumed to be
0.0001.

one of the six north american pds pedigrees we studied
showed a segregation pattern for markers spanning the
5-cm pds genetic interval that was incompatible with

linkage to chromosome 5q31. haplotype sharing between
siblings discordant for pds is present in pedigree k3001
(fig. 1a).
five of the six pds families that we analyzed were,
however, consistent with linkage to the chromosome 5q31

locus. in pedigrees k3002 and k3006, each affected sibling
shared the same 5q31 haplotypes across a portion of the
pds interval. pedigree k3005 demonstrates a haplotype
segregation pattern that is consistent with linkage to 5q31,
as the affected and unaffected siblings do not share the
same haplotypes. the affected siblings in k3008 shared the
same haplotypes for all four markers tested. the single
affected sibling in pedigree k3009 does not share the same
chromosomal haplotypes as her unaffected brother, therefore making pds consistent with linkage to 5q31 in this
pedigree (fig. 1a). under the assumption of genetic homogeneity for these five pedigrees, combined lod scores were
calculated (data not shown). a maximum combined lod

score of z=1.87 was obtained for marker d5s2011 at
recombination fraction theta=0.
recombination events were observed in two of our five
pds pedigrees that were otherwise consistent with linkage
to chromosome 5q31. crossovers were observed between
markers d5s1972 and d5s436 and pds in affected individual ii.1 from pedigree k3002, and in affected individual ii.2 from pedigree k3006 (fig. 1a). a series of more
densely spaced chromosome 5q31 markers were typed in
these two pedigrees in an attempt to map these recombination
events with a finer degree of resolution. the subsequent segregation analyses determined that the recombination events
in each of the two affected individuals were equally informative. in pedigree k3002, the recombination maps

between markers d5s207 and d5s2859 (individual ii.1)
(fig. 1b). the recombination event in individual ii.2 of
pedigree k3006 also maps between markers d5s207 and
d5s2859, as marker d5s207 is homozygous and therefore
uninformative in the boy’s mother (k3006, individual i.2)
(fig. 1b).

discussion
cormier-daire et al. mapped the first genetic locus for pds
to chromosome 5q31 [1] and identified recombination
events in two unrelated consanguineous families to identify
a minimum candidate interval of 5 cm bounded by the
markers d5s2017 (centromeric) and d5s436 (telomeric).
these findings prompted our undertaking of haplotype
segregation analysis in six small pds pedigrees of north

from the 5-cm pds interval of chromosome 5q31.
despite being hampered by the small size of each individual pedigree we studied, and the lack of consanguinity
in our families, the results from our investigation establish
that genetic heterogeneity exists for pds. this finding was
reached because cosegregation of pds and 5q31 markers
was not present in pedigree k3001 (fig. 1a), confirmed by a
direct identification of recombinant haplotypes. given the
small size of this pedigree, generating negative lod scores
≤−2 are only possible at, or close to, markers tested within
the pds interval. alternative explanations to genetic heterogeneity to account for this haplotype sharing among affected and unaffected siblings would include the extremely
unlikely possibility of double recombination for markers
within the interval, or nonpenetrance of pds in k3001, ii.3.
however, nonpenetrance has not yet been reported for pds.

overall, our results confirm that at least one other pds
locus exists, a finding that has also been anecdotally reported for uk pds pedigrees [2]. our confirmation of
genetic heterogeneity is perhaps a somewhat surprising
finding for a rare recessive disease with the distinctive
phenotypic feature of amelioration of seizures by administration of  xxxd3049xxx  in pharmacological doses. thus far,
no phenotypic differences in patients can be discerned between those pds pedigrees mapping to the 5q31 locus and
the nonlinked pedigree. in particular, no differences in age
of onset or diagnosis, severity, seizure type, responsiveness,
accompanying developmental sequelae, or outcome are apparent in our small cohort (table 1).
although the results of this investigation indicate that
five of our six pedigrees were consistent with linkage to the
5q31 locus (fig. 1a), a nonsignificant maximum lod score
of z=1.87 (theta=0), with marker d9s2011, was observed.
notwithstanding the failure to reach linkage significance in
the five pds pedigrees, whose haplotypes were either consistent with linkage to 5q31 or, alternatively, did not exclude
linkage to 5q31, we reasoned that the identification of
putative recombination events could prioritize genes within
the previously identified pds interval in an attempt to
identify a pds candidate gene and direct further molecular
analyses for a very rare disease in which family material is
extremely limited. to this end, we identified recombination
events between pds and markers d5s1972 and d5s436 in
pedigree k3002 and in pedigree k3006 following our initial
haplotype analysis (fig. 1a). thereafter, an additional six
markers were typed to refine these distal crossovers. we
determined that the crossover events in pedigrees k3002
and k3006 were equally informative, mapping between
d5s207 and d5s2859. assuming that pds in pedigrees
k3002 and k3006 indeed maps to chromosome 5q31, the
previously established pds genetic interval of 5 cm,
bounded by markers d5s2011-d5s638, can be refined. the
pds proximal boundary defined by cormier-daire et al.
(d5s2011) [1], in combination with the putative distal
boundary suggested by our analysis (d5s2859), would
uncover a high-priority interval of 2.0 mb (approximately
2.2 cm) within the 5.1-mb pds genetic interval (fig. 2).
this interval contains just 11 genes, italicized in table 2.
at the time of the identification of the 5q31 pds locus,
the genomic sequencing of the region was incomplete, and
only three genes were known to map within the 5 cm
interval: fibroblast growth factor-1 ( xxxg786xxx ), glucocorticoid
receptor ( xxxg1601xxx ), and the kiaao555 gene. currently, 21
refseq genes map to the pds candidate region (d5s2011–
d5s2859) based on the university of california santa cruz
(ucsc) human genome database (http://www.genome.
ucsc.edu) (table 2). prioritization of functional candidates
that are identified within the pds interval may be assigned
from a known role in cerebral development or general expression in the brain or neuronal tissue. however, using
these criteria, no outstanding candidate genes for pds are
apparent among these 21 genes.
alternatively, genes rated as low-priority pds candidates may be presumed to be those with a demonstrated
role in an unrelated disease or are known to act in cellular

pathways that appear unlikely to lead to pds through
recessive mutation. for example, in the graf gene
[guanosine 5c-triphosphate (gtp)ase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase], point and microdeletion mutations, in combination with 5q31 translocation
break points, have been associated with myelodysplastic
syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia [14]. mutations of the
 xxxg1601xxx  gene, which encodes a  xxxg1601xxx ,
are associated with a familial glucocorticoid resistance
disorder (omim: 138040). the rnf14 protein contains
a c3hc4-type (ring) zinc finger, a motif known to be
involved in protein–protein interactions. rnf14 has
been shown to interact with the  xxxg183xxx  protein, mutations of which are associated with either androgen insensitivity, prostate cancer, or spinal and bulbar
muscular atrophy (omim: 313700). interestingly, there
are two genes, protocadherin 1 (pcdh1) and protocadherin 12 (pcdh12), that reside within the pds interval. these genes encode protocadherin proteins which
are part of a subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. the
pcd proteins are membrane proteins found at cell–cell
boundaries. they are involved in neural cell adhesion,
suggesting a possible role in neuronal development and
may represent plausible candidate genes for pds mapping to 5q31.
in summary, haplotype segregation analysis of the 5q31
locus in six small unrelated north american pedigrees establishes that genetic heterogeneity exists for pds. we have
tabulated the 21 genes within the originally established
pds interval and 11 genes within our defined highest
priority interval, two of which are associated with disorders
seemingly unrelated to pds.
