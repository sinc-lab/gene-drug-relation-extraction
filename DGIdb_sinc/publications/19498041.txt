efficacy is defined as the ability of a ligand to elicit a
response upon binding to a receptor (stephenson, 1956) and
is arguably the most important parameter for optimization in
novel agonist drugs. to date, efficacy has largely been treated
as an empirical term, and several approaches comparing
equilibrium binding to functional potency have been described for its measurement (black and leff, 1983; ehlert,
1985). although they provide a pragmatic approach to ranking ligands, these methods make no attempt to explain the
molecular mechanism behind efficacy. one of the first attempts to provide a mechanistic explanation for agonist efficacy was by paton (1961), termed “rate theory.” this model
considers that excitation by a stimulant drug is proportional
to the rate of drug-receptor combination rather than to the
proportion of receptors occupied by the drug. in this case,
once the receptor has been activated and the signal transarticle, publication date, and citation information can be found at

after  xxxg449xxx  activation: the stimulation of guanosine 5⬘-o(3-[35s]thio)triphosphate binding to g␣ subunits, and the subsequent increase in intracellular calcium levels. these experiments revealed a range of intrinsic efficacy, from the lowefficacy  xxxd2950xxx  and oxotremorine to high-efficacy
acetylcholine. there was no relationship between agonist efficacy and the equilibrium binding affinity of each agonist (kd).
when efficacy was compared with the dissociation rate constant, however, the two were highly correlated, suggesting a
relationship between the duration of agonist binding at the
receptor and the intrinsic efficacy. these data suggest that
kinetic models incorporating the mean lifetime of specific complexes will be required to fully explain the nature of agonist
efficacy.

duced, it must be reset by dissociation of the agonist before
another activation event can be initiated by binding of another agonist molecule. thus, a high-efficacy ligand would
dissociate rapidly from the receptor, allowing another agonist to bind rapidly, whereas a low-efficacy agonist would
dissociated more slowly from the receptor, acting effectively
as a competitive antagonist against other agonist molecules.
this model was proposed after the observation that efficacy
and offset for a series of ligands at the guinea pig ileum were
negatively correlated.
since then, however, models have been developed that
describe efficacy in terms of the ability to stabilize an active
receptor conformation. perhaps the most widely used is the
two-state model, originally described for activation of ion
channels (del castillo and katz, 1957) but since adapted for
use with g protein-coupled receptors (karlin, 1967;
colquhoun, 1973; thron, 1973; leff, 1995). in this model, the
efficacy of an agonist is dependent on its affinity for r*
(active conformation) over r (inactive state). thus, an agonist that preferentially binds r* will drive the equilibrium

abstract
although there are several empirical approaches that enable
the comparison of relative agonist efficacy, the molecular basis
that underlies differences in the ability of g protein-coupled
receptor agonists to elicit a response is still largely unexplained.
several models have been described that incorporate the kinetics of receptor-mediated initiation of the g protein cycle, but
these have not directly addressed the influence of agonistbinding kinetics. to test this, we investigated the relationship
between the efficacy of seven  xxxg449xxx  agonists
and their rate of dissociation (koff) from the  xxxg449xxx . the
association and dissociation rate constants of the agonists
were determined using a l-[n-methyl]-[3h]scopolamine methyl
chloride competition binding assay in the presence of gtp. the
agonists displayed a range of association and dissociation
rates. relative agonist efficacy was measured at two points

cell culture. chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells transfected
with the cdna encoding the human m3 (cho-m3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was a kind gift from professor s. r. nahorski
(department of cell physiology and pharmacology, university of
leicester, leicester, uk). cho cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. cells were
maintained at 37°c in 5% co2/humidified air. cells were routinely
split 1:10, using trypsin-edta to lift cells, and were not used in
assays beyond passage 40.
cell membrane preparation. cho cells expressing the m3
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were grown to 80 to 90% confluence in 500-cm2 cell culture plates at 37°c in 5% co2. all subsequent
steps were conducted at 4°c to avoid receptor degradation. the cell
culture media were removed, and ice-cold buffer [1 ⫻ 10 ml; 10 mm
hepes, 0.9% (w/v) nacl, and 0.2% (w/v) edta, ph 7.4] was added
to the cells, which were then scraped from the plates into a 50-ml
corning tube (corning inc., corning, ny) and subsequently centrifuged at 250g for 5 min to allow a pellet to form. the supernatant
fraction was aspirated, and 10 ml per 500-cm2 tray of wash buffer (10
mm hepes and 10 mm edta, ph 7.4) was added to the pellet. this
was homogenized using an electrical homogenizer ultra-turrax (ikawerk gmbh & co. kg, staufen, germany) (position 6, 4 ⫻ 5-s
bursts) and subsequently centrifuged at 48,000g at 4°c (beckman
avanti j-251 ultracentrifuge; beckman coulter, fullerton, ca) for
30 min. the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was rehomogenized and centrifuged as described above in wash buffer. the
final pellet was suspended in ice-cold 10 mm hepes and 0.1 mm
edta, ph 7.4, at a concentration of 5 to 10 mg/ml. protein concentration was determined by the bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca) based on the method of bradford (1976)
using bsa as a standard, and aliquots were maintained at ⫺80°c
until required.
common procedures applicable to all radioligand binding experiments. all radioligand experiments were conducted in
96-deep-well plates in assay binding buffer hbss, ph 7.4, with gtp
(100 ␮m) at 37°c. in all cases, nonspecific binding was determined in
the presence of 1 ␮m atropine. after the indicated incubation period,
bound and free [3h]nms were separated by rapid vacuum filtration
using a filtermate cell harvester (perkinelmer life and analytical
sciences, beaconsfield, uk) onto 96-well gf/b filter plates and rapidly washed three times with ice-cold 20 mm hepes, ph 7.4. after
drying (⬎4 h), 40 ␮l of microscint 20 (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences) was added to each well, and radioactivity was quantified using single-photon counting on a topcount microplate scintillation counter (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences). aliquots
of [3h]nms were also quantified accurately to determine how much
radioactivity was added to each well using liquid scintillation spectrometry on an ls6500 scintillation counter (beckman coulter). in
all experiments, total binding never exceeded more than 10% of that
added, limiting complications associated with depletion of the free
radioligand concentration (carter et al., 2007).
[3h]nms saturation binding. binding was performed with a
range of concentrations of [3h]nms (⬃0.004–8 nm) to construct
saturation binding curves, as described by dowling and charlton

between the two states toward the active conformation and
will display high efficacy. if the binding affinity is higher for
r than r*, an agonist will exhibit negative efficacy by driving
the equilibrium toward the inactive state. a full spectrum of
efficacy can be established between these two extremes, governed by the differential in affinity for the two receptor
states. this model predicts that affinity and efficacy are
inextricably linked (colquhoun, 1998), although unlike paton’s rate theory, higher relative affinity at the active conformation would result in a higher efficacy agonist. this model
has been extended to include the presence of g proteins in
the extended ternary complex model (samama et al., 1993) or
the more thermodynamically complete cubic ternary complex
model (weiss et al., 1996). the assumption of equilibrium in
these models is, however, a simplification, because the ternary complex is not stable and does not accumulate in the
presence of agonist.
to address this, waelbroeck et al. (1997) proposed a kinetic
model in which the receptor acts as an enzyme that catalyzes
gdp/gtp exchange on the g protein and the agonist as an
allosteric activator. in this model, once the gtp-bound g
protein dissociates, the agonist-bound receptor is free to catalyze another reaction cycle. a similar kinetic approach has
since been described for the cubic ternary complex model, in
which the model was modified to include the breakdown of
the ternary complex and recycling of g protein (shea et al.,
2000; kinzer-ursem and linderman, 2007). like the kinetic
model of waelbroeck et al. (1997), providing the agonist remains bound to receptor, it is able to catalyze multiple
rounds of the g protein cycle.
according to these newer kinetic models, it may be hypothesized that the mean receptor residency time of a rapidly
dissociating agonist may not be long enough to facilitate a
full, productive turn of the cycle (thus showing low efficacy),
whereas a slowly dissociating agonist may catalyze several
cycles before dissociating, thereby displaying higher efficacy
(scheme 1). to test this, we determined the dissociation rates
of seven muscarinic  xxxg449xxx  agonists and compared them
with two empirical measures of agonist efficacy, intrinsic
activity (i.a.) and ␶, from the operational model of black and
leff (1983), in an effort to test whether the observed residency of an agonist at the receptor is directly linked to
apparent efficacy.

[35s]gtp␥s binding assay. the [35s]gtp␥s binding assays
were performed in white 96-well optiplates in a final volume of 250
␮l as follows. in brief, the frozen cell membranes were thawed and
resuspended in gtp␥s binding buffer [hbss containing 20 mm
hepes, 10 ␮g/ml saponin, and 0.1% (w/v) bsa, ph 7.4]. membranes
(30 ␮g/well), gdp (1 ␮m), spa beads (1 mg/well), [35s]gtp␥s (300
pm), and the muscarinic m3 agonists at a range of concentrations
were added to the plates. plates were incubated for a further 1 h at
30°c with shaking before centrifugation at 3000 rpm (jouan b4i;
jouan, st. herblain, france) for 3 min and then read on the topcount (30 s/well).

slightly for each experiment (⬍5%), data are shown graphically as
the mean ⫾ range for individual representative experiments,
whereas all values reported in the text and tables are mean ⫾ s.e.m.
for the indicated number of experiments. all experiments were analyzed by either linear or nonregression using prism 4.0 (graphpad

(2006). cho-m3 cell membranes (10 ␮g/well) were incubated in
96-deep-well plates at 37°c in assay binding buffer with gentle
agitation for 3 h to ensure that equilibrium was reached. because of
the low concentrations of [3h]nms used, the assay volume was
increased to 1.5 ml to avoid significant ligand depletion.
determination of agonist ki. to obtain affinity estimates of
unlabeled agonists, [3h]nms competition experiments were performed at equilibrium. [3h]nms was used at a concentration of
approximately 350 pm (⬃40,000 c.p.m. in a volume of 1.5 ml) such
that the total binding never exceeded more than 10% of that added.
[3h]nms was incubated in the presence of the indicated concentration of unlabeled agonist and cho cell membranes (10 ␮g/well) at
37°c with agitation for 3 h.
determination of the association rate (kon) and dissociation rate (koff) of [3h]nms. to determine the kon, the kob was
calculated at three different concentrations of [3h]nms (approximately 222, 666, and 2000 pm; exact concentrations were calculated
in each experiment using liquid scintillation counting) the experiment was initiated (t ⫽ 0) by the addition of cho-m3 cell membranes
(10 ␮g/well) to [3h]nms in assay binding buffer (final assay volume,
500 ␮l) and incubated with gentle agitation. free [3h]nms was
separated at multiple time points to construct association kinetic
curves. care was taken to ensure that saturation for each experiment was reached before the experiment was terminated. after
incubation, bound radioactivity was separated from free by rapid
filtration, plates were left to dry, and radioactivity was quantified (as
described previously). the kinetic rate constants for [3h]nms were
calculated as described below under data analysis.
competition kinetics. the kinetic parameters of unlabeled agonists were assessed using a competition kinetic binding assay as
described by dowling and charlton (2006). approximately 2 nm
[3h]nms (a concentration that avoids ligand depletion in this assay
volume) was added simultaneously with the unlabeled compound to
cho-m3 membranes (10 ␮g/well) in 500 ␮l of assay buffer. the
degree of [3h]nms bound to the receptor was assessed at multiple
time points by filtration harvesting and liquid scintillation counting,
as described previously. nonspecific binding was determined as the
amount of radioligand bound to the filters and membrane in the
presence of atropine (1 ␮m) and was subtracted from each time point,
meaning that t ⫽ 0 was always equal to 0. each time point was
conducted on the same 96-deep-well plate incubated at 37°c with
constant agitation. reactions were considered stopped once the
membranes reached the filter, and the first wash was applied within
1 s. three different concentrations of unlabeled competitor were
tested to ensure the rate parameters calculated were independent of
ligand concentration. all compounds were tested  xxxd1891xxx -, 3-, and 1-fold
of their respective ki, and data were globally fitted using eq. 2 to
simultaneously calculate kon and koff.

fluorometric imaging plate reader. cho-m3 cells were seeded
into 96-well black plates (costar; corning life sciences, acton, ma)
at 50,000 cells/well in 100 ␮l of tissue culture medium, supplemented
as above, and incubated at 37°c/5% co2 for approximately 24 h. on
the day of the experiment, the cells were loaded in hbss without
phenol red containing 0.1% (w/v) bsa, hepes (20 mm), fluo-4-am
[2 ␮m, 50 ␮g of fluo-4-am dissolved in 44 ␮l of  xxxd1896xxx /
pluronic acid (1:1)], probenecid (250 ␮m), and brilliant black (100
␮m), and incubated at 37°c/5% co2 for 30 min. agonist-induced
changes in ca2⫹ concentration were monitored using fluorometric
imaging plate reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). the laser
intensity on the fluorometric imaging plate reader was set between
0.4 and 0.5 w, a level sufficient to obtain basal fluorescence of
⬃10,000 u. basal fluorescence was monitored for 10 s before the
addition of 50 ␮l of muscarinic agonist at a speed of 50 ␮l/s, and the
fluorescence change was monitored for 5 min. responses to agonist
were expressed as the change in fluorescence from baseline to peak.

characterization of  xxxg449xxx -expressing cho
cell line. specific [3h]nms binding to muscarinic receptors
in cho-m3 membranes was saturable and best described by
the interaction of the radioligand with a single population of
high-affinity binding sites. the expression level of the m3
cho-cell line was estimated from the bmax in [3h]nms
saturation binding  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx .0 ⫾ 0.4 pmol/mg (n ⫽ 4). from these
studies, the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) of
[3h]nms was determined to be 289 ⫾ 13 pm (n ⫽ 4).
[3h]nms competition binding studies. the cho-m3
receptor binding profile of the seven muscarinic agonists was
determined in buffer containing gtp (100 ␮m). gtp was
included to ensure that agonist binding only occurred to the
uncoupled form of the  xxxg449xxx . all seven agonists
produced concentration-dependent inhibition of specific
[3h]nms binding. examples of competition curve data are
shown in fig. 1, and pki values were determined as shown in
table 1. slope parameter estimates for all agonists tested

were not different from unity, suggesting that binding occurs
to a single population of receptor.
characterization of [3h]nms kinetic parameters. a
family of association kinetic curves was constructed using a
range of [3h]nms concentrations. each association curve
was monitored until equilibrium was achieved (fig. 2). the
data were globally fitted to eq. 2 to derive a single best-fit
estimate for the kon and koff of [3h]nms. mean values obtained for the on- and off-rates were 9.26 ⫾ 0.69 ⫻ 108 m⫺1 䡠
min⫺1 and 0.30 ⫾ 0.05 min⫺1, respectively. the kinetically
derived kd (koff/kon) calculated from the mean values for the
individual experiments (341 ⫾ 72 pm) was in good agreement
with the value obtained from [3h]nms saturation experiments of 289 ⫾ 13 pm.
competition kinetic binding. this method models the
binding between two ligands, one labeled and one unlabeled,
competing for the same receptor site. representative curves
for acetylcholine and  xxxd2950xxx  are shown in fig. 3, a and
b, respectively. the pattern of [3h]nms binding over time
was dependent on the off-rate of the competing agonist.
[3h]nms association in the presence of more slowly equilibrating competitors (slow off-rate) was two-phase. the initial, rapid phase was equivalent to the rate of association of
radioligand alone and represents binding to free receptors.
the second phase represents equilibration of the two ligands
with the receptor and was significantly slower. in the presence of more rapidly equilibrating agonists, the first phase of
[3h]nms binding was much less apparent because the majority of free receptors (at t ⫽ 0) were occupied first by the
competitor. progression curves for [3h]nms alone and in the
presence of three different concentrations of competitor were
globally fitted to eq. 3, enabling the calculation of both kon
(k3) and koff (k4) for each of the agonists, as reported in table
1. because the koff values were similar across the cohort, we
tested whether the data were sufficient to discriminate between the agonists. the quality of fit was worse when the koff
was fixed to any value outside that was predicted by simultaneous fitting. there was a much larger difference in kon
values between the agonists. interestingly, these correlated
well with the kd (r2 ⫽ 0.92, p ⬍ 0.001 for logkon versus pkd),
suggesting that it is the on-rate that governs the equilibrium
affinity of these agonists. to validate the rate constants, the
kinetically derived kd values (koff/kon) were compared with
the affinity constant (ki) obtained from equilibrium competition binding experiments (fig. 4). although there was a
very good correlation (r2 ⫽ 0.99) between these two values,

there was a small (approximately 2-fold) but consistent difference for all of the agonists.
measurement of [35s]gtp␥s binding activity. each
ligand stimulated the incorporation of [35s]gtp␥s into the
cho-m3 membranes, displaying a range of potency and intrinsic activity (fig. 5a and table 2). when the data were

simultaneously fitted to the operational model, ␶ values were
very low, suggesting that there was little if any receptor
reserve at this early step in the transduction pathway.
measurement of changes in cytoplasmic [ca2ⴙ]. all
seven of the muscarinic agonists tested stimulated an increased intracellular calcium concentration in cho-m3 cells
(fig. 5b). the maximal responses to these ligands did not
differ significantly from each other (p ⬍ 0.05) despite the fact
that some of these ligands were partial agonists in the
gtp␥s assay. this is probably because of the greater degree
of amplification associated with calcium signaling. because
relative efficacy could not be determined in this system by
comparing maximal agonist responses, the data were fitted
to an operational model that compares binding affinity to
functional potency to calculate ␶, a value that can be used to
compare relative efficacies of agonists when tested in the
same system (black and leff, 1983). a range of ␶ values were
obtained that broadly agreed with the rank order of intrinsic
activity from the [35s]gtp␥s binding assay (table 2).
relationship between agonist efficacy and koff.
there was no relationship between the affinity (kd) of the
seven agonists tested here and their relative efficacy determined either in the calcium assay (r2 ⫽ 0.05, p ⫽ 0.63) or
[35s]-gtp␥s (r2 ⫽ 0.07, p ⫽ 0.57) (fig. 6, a and c, respectively). likewise, there was no relationship between kon and
efficacy (r2 ⫽ 0.23, p ⫽ 0.28, and r2 ⫽ 0.32, p ⫽ 0.19 from
ca2⫹ and gtp␥s data, respectively) (correlation not shown).
however, when the efficacy of each agonist was compared
with its dissociation rate constant (koff), a highly significant
correlation was obtained, with the highest efficacy ligands
having the slowest dissociation rates. this correlation was
observed when koff was compared with either ␶ from the
calcium assay (r2 ⫽ 0.98, p ⬍ 0.0001) or i.a. from the gtp␥s
data (r2 ⫽ 0.95, p ⫽ 0.0002), suggesting that the dissociation
rate for these muscarinic agonists plays an important role in
defining efficacy at the  xxxg449xxx  (fig. 6, b and d).

discussion
the aim of this study was to investigate whether the observed rate of agonist dissociation is related to observed
efficacy, such that the receptor residency time of a rapidly
dissociating agonist is not always long enough to facilitate a

full, productive g protein activation event (thus showing low
efficacy), whereas a slowly dissociating agonist may catalyze
several g protein activation cycles before dissociating,
thereby displaying higher efficacy.
to assess relative agonist efficacy, we measured m3-mediated activation at two different points: direct activation of g␣
subunits using gtp␥s binding, and the subsequent release
of intracellular calcium. the agonists displayed different
maximal responses in the gtp␥s assay but were all maximally effective in the calcium experiments. to determine
relative efficacy from the calcium data, we fitted the data to
the operational model of black and leff (1983). the values
obtained using this method were in broad agreement with
intrinsic activity measurements from the gtp␥s assay.
to determine the dissociation kinetics of the seven agonists, we used a competition kinetic method using a radiolabeled antagonist, [3h]nms (dowling and charlton, 2006).
the agonists displayed a range of dissociation rate constants,
from 5.6 min⫺1 for acetylcholine to 17.6 min⫺1 for oxotremorine. the off-rate of acetylcholine is moderately faster than
that previously described by kellar et al. (1985) using
[3h]acetylcholine (1.04 min⫺1), but this was performed at
25°c in cerebral cortex and probably represents a mixture of
rates from a variety of muscarinic receptor subtypes. the
association rate constants of these agonists were significantly slower than those previously reported for antagonists
at the  xxxg449xxx  (dowling and charlton, 2006). this is
contrary to the generally assumed situation that equilibrium
affinity is governed predominantly by off-rate and that onrate is effectively diffusion-limited. it is, however, consistent
with previous attempts to measure agonist kinetics at mus-

relating  xxxg449xxx  agonist efficacy to dissociation rate

relationship between the efficacy of these muscarinic agonists with the rate of dissociation from the  xxxg449xxx . can
this be reconciled with what we understand about the transduction of receptor signals and the g protein activation cycle?
we have shown that the half-life of the agonists tested ranges
from 7.8 s for acetylcholine to 2.6 s with oxotremorine. if the
efficacy of oxotremorine is limited by its duration at the
receptor, the activation interval would need to be in the
range of 2.6 s or less so that oxotremorine is not always able
to promote a productive turn of the g protein cycle. whereas
the conformational change in receptor and resultant receptor-g protein interaction proceeds very rapidly after agonist
binding, in the range of 30 to 50 ms (lohse et al., 2008), the
next step in the activation cycle, gdp release from the ␣
subunit, is slow and represents the rate-limiting step in the
g protein cycle. biddlecome and colleagues (1996) measured
the rate of gdp dissociation from g␣q after carbachol-induced activation by the m1 muscarinic receptor and found
that at a saturating concentration of carbachol, gdp dissociation from g␣q was biphasic with constants of 20 and 1.4
min⫺1. because of differences in experimental protocol, it is
not possible to directly compare these time constants with
those described in the current study, but it suggests that the
rate-limiting step in the cycle may occur at a rate similar to
the mean residency time of oxotremorine at the  xxxg449xxx 
(2.6 s). it is therefore possible that not all receptor binding
events will last long enough to promote the dissociation of
gdp and will not therefore activate a productive turn of the
g protein cycle.
several other groups have made similar observations, albeit comparing just two ligands. sklar et al. (1985) found that
at the formyl peptide receptor, the full agonist fnlpntl-fl
dissociated with a rate constant of 0.35 min⫺1, whereas the
dissociation rate of the partial agonist fmp was much faster

carinic receptors using competition binding (schreiber et al.,
1985). although the rate constants described by schreiber
and colleagues can not be directly compared with those obtained in the current study as binding was performed in
brain tissue in which multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes
exist, the authors demonstrated that at the low-affinity receptor site, the association kinetics were 2 to 5 orders of
magnitude lower for agonists compared with antagonists.
sklar and colleagues (1985) made similar observations, in
which formyl peptide agonist affinity was largely governed
by changes in on-rate rather than off-rate. these reports are
consistent with our current observation that it is predominantly the kon that defines the equilibrium affinity of muscarinic agonists.
we have measured the kinetic rate constants in the presence of gtp to remove any pre-existing high-affinity guanine
nucleotide-free complexes that may have complicated the
analysis (cohen et al., 1996). it is important to note, however,
that we can not definitively ascribe our measured rate constants to a single receptor-g protein complex. indeed, the
two-state model would predict that they comprise a mixture
of microscopic rate constants, and that these are directly
influenced by the efficacy of the agonist (colquhoun, 1998).
for example, a high-efficacy ligand may more effectively
stabilize the activated, high-affinity ar*g(gtp) complex,
thereby displaying a slower dissociation rate than an agonist
that is unable to promote isomerization to the high-affinity
state. despite this, the observed, macroscopic dissociation
rate constants are still useful descriptors of the mean residency time at the receptor, even though they probably represent a mixture of microscopic rate constants.
the data presented in this report are not consistent with
the notion that macroscopic equilibrium affinity is correlated
to observed efficacy. rather, we have demonstrated a clear

tionship between agonist off-rate and efficacy at these alternative, non-g protein-mediated pathways will be an interesting area for future investigations.
in summary, we have shown that agonist efficacy is positively correlated to duration at the receptor. this suggests
that equilibrium models alone are not sufficient to describe a
dynamic signaling system, and that kinetic models incorporating duration of agonist binding alongside the rate of effector activation will be required to fully explain the nature of
efficacy at g protein-coupled receptors.

at 5.1 min⫺1. a similar relationship was reported for the
␣2-adrenoceptor agonists uk14,304 and clonidine (paris et
al., 1989). dissociation experiments using the radiolabeled
forms of the agonist showed two rate constants, but in each
case, the off-rates of the full agonist uk14,304 were at least
10-fold slower than that of the partial agonist clonidine (0.08
and 1.0 min⫺1 for the fastest phase, respectively). these
experiments were performed at 25°c, but more recently,
hoeren and colleagues (2008) have repeated these findings at
37°c, where it was found that the median binding of duration
of uk14,304 was approximately 3-fold longer than that of
clonidine (79.8 s and 27.6 s, respectively). a key issue with
these examples is that in each case, only two ligands were
examined. in this present study, we chose a larger cohort of
agonists to represent a broader range of intrinsic efficacy.
interestingly, however, rather than an even distribution of
efficacy and dissociation rates, the seven ligands examined
here tended to form two separate groups of high-efficacy
ligands with slow off-rates and lower efficacy ligands with
more rapid dissociation kinetics. this could be a chance occurrence that reflects the need to test much larger agonist
collections. alternatively, it could be the nature of the conformational change induced by the agonists, whereby a
longer residency provides sufficient time for the receptor to
isomerize into the high-affinity state, effectively locking the
agonist into the receptor. there may even be a threshold
duration at the receptor after which the receptor can isomerize. hence, it cannot be concluded that receptor residency
drives efficacy or vice versa, but rather that both elements
are inextricably linked.
it is clear that this correlation of long receptor residency
with higher efficacy is in direct contrast to paton’s “rate
theory” (paton, 1961), where he argued that high-efficacy
ligands dissociate quickly from the receptor, permitting a
more rapid breakdown of the ternary complex so that the
system would reset faster, allowing a second activation event
to occur. there is evidence now, however, that the g protein
does not necessarily dissociate from receptor, meaning that
the agonist does not have to dissociate from the receptor for
the g protein to dissociate (lambert, 2008). this implies that
the same agonist-receptor-g protein complex could cycle several times before dissociation of the agonist, the rate of which
would depend on gdp dissociation to form the high-affinity
guanine nucleotide-free complex (scheme 1).
the present study has focused on g protein-mediated responses, but there are a growing number of examples of
alternative g protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways
(e.g., ␤-arrestin-mediated events) (defea, 2008). it is interesting to consider whether efficacy at these other pathways
might also be defined, in part, by the residency time of the
agonist at the receptor. it has been shown that agonist withdrawal leads to swift dissociation of the receptor-␤-arrestin2
complex, demonstrating that interaction of ␤-arrestin2 with
the ␤2 adrenoceptor is highly dependent on coincident agonist binding (krasel et al., 2005). it is therefore plausible that
an agonist that dissociates slowly from this complex may be
more likely to initiate a downstream signal. there are other
examples, however, in which the efficacy measured at two
different pathways is not correlated (galandrin and bouvier,
2006), suggesting that the agonists stabilize discrete active
conformations that may have different efficiencies across
multiple pathways (kenakin, 2007). investigating the rela-
