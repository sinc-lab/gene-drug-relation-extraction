sequential polymerase chain reaction experabstract
iments were performed to amplify a unique sequence representing a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (g-protein)coupled receptor from rat hypothalamic cdna. degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved amino acids from
transmembrane domains iii, v, and vi of known receptors
[5-ht1a, 5-ht,c, and 5-ht2; 5-ht is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine)] were used as primers for the sequential reactions.
the resulting product was subcloned and used to screen a rat
genomic library to identify a full-length clone ( xxxg1112xxx ) containing an intronless open reading frame encoding a 366-amino
acid seven-transmembrane domain protein. the human homolog was isolated, and its encoded protein had 93% overall
amino acid identity with the rat sequence. within the conserved
transmembrane domains, the sequences exhibit approximately
52%, 59%, 65%, and 68% amino acid identity with the known
rat 5-ht1a, rat 5-htib, rat  xxxg1110xxx , and human 5 -ht1e
receptors, respectively.  xxxg1112xxx  was subcloned into a eukaryotic
expression vector system and expressed in cosm6 cells. studies
on broken cell preparations indicate that the expressed receptor exhibits 125i-labeled  xxxd2527xxx  (lsd)
binding that can be displaced by serotonin but not by other
biogenic amines. the specific binding is displaced by the
selective  xxxg1110xxx  agonist sumatriptan but not by the mixed
5-htia/1d agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine. 125i-labeled
lsd binding was competitively antagonized by the ergot alkaloids  xxxd2621xxx  and ergotamine. hela cells transfected with
the  xxxg1112xxx  gene exhibited inhibition of adenylate cyclase in
response to serotonin.  xxxg1112xxx  is expressed at low levels throughout the brain, with the greatest expression in the cortex,
hippocampus, and striatum.  xxxg1112xxx  thus represents a 5-ht
receptor of the 5-ht1 class, and we propose that, based on the
pharmacological characterization,  xxxg1112xxx  represents an additional 5-htle-like receptor.

serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) is a biogenic amine
neurotransmitter found in both the central and peripheral
nervous systems (for review, see ref. 1). a majority of
serotonin-containing neurons in the central nervous system
have cell bodies located in association with the raphe nuclei
in the midline area of the brainstem. these cells send
projections to the cortex, several limbic structures (hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and amygdala) as well
as the lateral geniculate and superior colliculus. serotonergic
transmission through these pathways is thought to be involved with a variety of behaviors and disorders including
anxiety, sleep regulation, aggression, and depression. to
understand the effects of current drug therapies and also
develop additional selective drugs, the receptor systems

involved in serotonergic transmission along these pathways
must be elucidated.
pharmacological experiments have suggested that the actions of serotonin are mediated by multiple types of serotonin
receptors, each having a distinct profile of activity with
respect to serotonin-related drugs (2). several serotonin
receptors have been identified by cdna cloning and have
been shown to be guanine nucleotide-binding protein (gprotein)-coupled molecules with the putative seventransmembrane domain structure characteristic of many receptors, including the prototypes rhodopsin and the 3-adrenergic receptors (3). members of the serotonin receptor family
have been subdivided on the basis of either affinities for
serotonin or sequence similarities. members of the 5-ht1
subgroup are characterized by their high affinities for serotonin, whereas 5-ht2 receptors exhibit low affinity. currently, five 5-ht1 and one  xxxg1113xxx  have been identified pharmacologically (5-ht1a, 5-ht1b, 5-htic,  xxxg1110xxx ,
 xxxg1111xxx , and 5-ht2). genomic and/or cdna clones for all of
these receptors have been isolated, and their sequences have
been determined (4-11).
in an attempt to identify other receptors that belong to the
family of 5-ht receptors, we used a strategy based upon
similarities shared among known members of the family. we
designed highly degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding
to conserved amino acid sequences in putative transmembrane domains iii, v, and vi of the 5-ht1a, 5-ht,c, and
5-ht2 receptors. these oligonucleotides were used in sequential polymerase chain reactions (pcr) with rat hypothalamus cdna as the template to generate a series of clones.
here we report that one of these clones and its human
homolog¶ correspond to a 5-ht receptor that is more closely
related in sequence to the recently cloned human  xxxg1111xxx  receptor ( xxxg1111xxx ) than any previously described 5-ht receptor but
clearly is a new member of the 5-ht1 receptor family. initial
pharmacological characterization of this receptor, which is
negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, is similar to but
distinct from that described previously for the 5-htle receptor (9, 12, 13), and therefore we propose that  xxxg1112xxx  belongs
to a new subgroup of 5-htle-like receptors.

(stratagene). oligonucleotides of degenerate sequence were
synthesized corresponding to conserved amino acid sequences of portions of putative transmembrane domains iii,
v, and vi of the 5-htla and 5-ht,c receptors [leu-cysala-ile-(ala or ser)-leu-asp-arg-tyr, phe-(val or gly)-alaphe-(phe or tyr)-ile-pro-leu, and (cys or met)-trp-(leu or

(30 cycles of 94°c for 15 sec, 55°c for 30 sec, and 72°c for 30
sec with a perkin elmer cetus 9600 thermal cycler) used
oligonucleotides corresponding to transmembrane regions iii
and vi (10 ug each) with the hypothalamus cdna as a
template. products >500 bases were isolated by agarose gel
electrophoresis and used as templates for a second pcr
reaction with oligonucleotides iii and v. the resulting products were ligated into pbluescript (stratagene) and used to
transform dhsa bacteria (brl). cloned dna was used to
probe both rat and human genomic libraries (stratagene). all
sequencing was performed by the dideoxy-termination
method (14) with sequenase (united states biochemical).
sequence data were compiled and analyzed by using genetics computer group sequence software (madison, wi) (15).

expression in cos-m6 cells. all expression and pharmacological experiments were carried out with the rat  xxxg1112xxx 
clone. cosm6 cells (a subclonal line of cos-7 cells, obtained
from edith womack in the laboratory of j. l. goldstein,
university of texas health sciences, dallas, and generously
provided by l. e. limbird, vanderbilt university) or hela
cells were transfected by using the deae dextran or calcium
phosphate methods, respectively, with plasmids (10 ,g of
cesium chloride-purified plasmid per 10-cm dish) pdp5ht1a
(16), pdp5mr77, or pbc12bibeta2 (17) (hamster 12adrenergic receptor gene). the hamster f2-adrenergic receptor gene, obtained from atcc (deposited by r. j. lefkowitz, duke university), was subcloned into the pbc12bi
eukaryotic expression vector [provided by b. cullen, duke
university (18)]. cotransfection experiments used 2 ,ug of
pbc12bibeta2 combined with 10 ,g of either pdpsht1a
(5-ht1a) or pdpsm77 ( xxxg1112xxx ).
12-5-labeled  xxxd2527xxx  (lsd) binding.
approximately 60 hr after transfection, cosm6 cells were
removed from dishes by using edta (gibco) and a cell
scraper and then were collected by centrifugation (250 x g,
5 min). pellets were resuspended in 50 mm tris hcl (ph 7.6)
with a polytron homogenizer, centrifuged for 20 min at 40,000
x g, and resuspended in the same buffer (500 ,l1 per 10-cm
dish). 125i-lsd (nen, 2200 ci/mmol; 1 ci = 37 gbq) binding
was assessed in a 100-,li final volume and contained 0.02%
ascorbate, cosm6 membranes (15 jig of protein), 1 nm
125i-lsd (final concentration), and various unlabeled test
compounds. nonspecific binding was determined by using
100 ,um serotonin, and typically was <10% of total dpm.
after 60 min at 37°c, 2 ml of ice-cold 50 mm tris hcl was
added to each tube, and bound ligand was isolated on 0.1%
polyethyleneimine-soaked gf/b glass fiber filters, washed
twice, and assayed for radioactivity. protein concentration
was measured by the bradford dye binding method (bio-rad)
(19). binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression

washed twice with 10 ml of krebs-ringer buffer (krb)
containing 134 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kci, 2.5 mm cac12, 2.5
mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.18 mm kh2po4, 11.1 mm glucose, 20 mm
hepes-naoh, and 0.001% phenol red (ph 7.35). krb containing 4 ,ci of [3h]adenine (10 ml per dish) was added, and
the dishes were placed in a 37°c air incubator for 2 hr. the
dishes were washed once with krb and once with 10 ml of
edta, and then the cells were incubated with 10 ml of fresh
edta for 30 min at 37°c. cells were resuspended, pooled,
and pelleted at 250 x g for 5 min. the final pellet was
suspended in krb containing 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) and 0.02% ascorbate, and 400 ,ul of the cell
suspension was dispensed to each assay tube. after a 5-min
preincubation at 37°c, the tubes were cooled on ice, various
test compounds or krb/ xxxd2388xxx  was added, and the tubes
were returned to the 37°c bath for 10 min. the 37°c incubations were ended by placing the tubes on ice and adding 550
ili of ice-cold 10% perchloric acid containing 5500 dpm of
[14c]camp, 110 ,ug of unlabeled atp, 55 ,g of unlabeled
camp, and 0.002% phenol red. samples were centrifuged at
3700 rpm for 15 min, and the transferred supernatants were
neutralized with 50 ,li of 10 m koh. insoluble kc104 was
removed by centrifugation, and 50-i,l aliquots were removed
for determination of total radioactivity in each sample. the
remaining 1.0 ml was used for determination of camp by the
sequential dowex/alumina ion-exchange method (22). conversion of cell-associated [3h]atp to [3h]camp was expressed as a percentage of total cell-associated radioactivity
(from the 50-,ld sample) and was normalized to the percentage
recovery of [14c]camp tracer (generally 25-40%).
semiquantitative pcr. to determine the tissue distribution
of  xxxg1112xxx  mrna expression in rat, we designed a pcr
protocol that takes advantage of the intron present in the
genomic  xxxg1112xxx  clone (fig. 3a). two oligonucleotide primers
were designed-one was the inverse complement of nucleotides 590-615, and the other corresponded to the region of the
cdna 20 nucleotides upstream from the putative splice site.
in a pcr assay, these primers amplify a 563-bp fragment from
cdna template but not from genomic dna. poly(a)+ rna
was isolated from a variety of dissected rat tissues including
several brain regions. first-strand cdna was synthesized
from 1 ,ug of poly(a)+ rna from each tissue by using
moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. two
microliters of a 1:10 dilution of each cdna was used as
template in a pcr reaction with the primers described above
for 30 amplification cycles; 30 cycles was determined to be
within the linear amplification range under the conditions
used. equal aliquots (10 ,l) of each pcr reaction were
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. the resulting gel
was denatured, neutralized, transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane, and probed with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide
complementary to nucleotides 364-385 of  xxxg1112xxx .

results and discussion
identification of cdna and genomic  xxxg1112xxx  clones. we used
sequential amplification of rat hypothalamus cdnas with

nested primers and pcr to identify novel 5-ht receptor-like
sequences. the first amplification was performed with degenerate primers (with cloning sites) corresponding to portions of the coding regions of putative transmembrane domains iii and vi that are conserved among known catecholamine and serotonin receptors from the g-protein-associated
receptor superfamily. products longer than 500 base pairs
(bp) were isolated and used as templates in a second amplification designed to amplify cdnas encoding proteins
closely related to known 5-ht receptors (by using the same
transmembrane iii degenerate primer and a degenerate
primer corresponding to residues in transmembrane v that

conserved among known 5-ht receptors but not catecholamine receptors). the pcr products were ligated to
vector, and bacterial transformation resulted in approximately 1000 colonies, of which >95% hybridized to a mixture
of radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to nonconserved regions located between transmembrane domains iii
and v of the rat 5-ht1a (nucleotides 1002-976), 5-htic
(nucleotides 879-856), and 5-ht2 (nucleotides 1515-1488)
receptors. thirty six colonies that showed either minimal or
no hybridization were picked and reprobed with the same
oligonucleotide mixture, and partial sequences of nonhybridizing clones were determined. from this screening, two
distinct cdna clones were isolated whose sequences had
significant similarity to g-protein-associated receptors. one
of these, designated  xxxg1112xxx , is described in this paper.
we tried unsuccessfully to screen a rat hypothalamus
cdna library with the  xxxg1112xxx  pcr product as a probe. since
many neurotransmitter receptor genes of this superfamily do
not contain introns, we hypothesized that a genomic clone
may contain an intact open reading frame. a rat genomic
library was probed with radiolabeled  xxxg1112xxx  dna. this
resulted in the isolation and subsequent subcloning of a
2.5-kilobase (kb) fragment that contained an apparently intronless open reading frame of 1098 nucleotides. however,
the reading frame upstream from an apparent initiation codon
was also open. therefore, we used an anchor-pcr protocol
with an oligonucleotide primer complementary to nucleotides
311-289 and a poly(dc) oligonucleotide to amplify template
rat brain cdna tailed with dg and cloned the largest product.
the sequence of this partial  xxxg1112xxx  cdna clone was identical
to the genomic clone from nucleotide 97 to nucleotide 311 but
was completely different at its 5' end beginning 41 nucleotides upstream from the presumed initiation codon. the
cdna sequence contained stop codons in frame with the
putative coding sequence, suggesting that the assignment of
the initiation codon was correct. upon closer examination of
the genomic clone, it was evident that an intron acceptor site
was at nucleotide 97 (asterisk at top of fig. 1). the intron lies
upstream from the complete open reading frame encoding the
putative receptor. because the open reading frame encoded
a 366-amino acid sequence that is highly related to known
receptors throughout its entire length, we concluded that the
mrna contained no further introns.
predicted amino acid sequence of rat and human  xxxg1112xxx .
the predicted protein contains seven hydrophobic regions as
determined by hydropathy calculations (23) (data not shown).
in addition, the n-terminal putative extracellular domain has
two potential sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation at
amino acids 5 and 10 (fig. 1, black triangles). there are
several potential protein kinase c (circles) and calmodulin
kinase ii phosphorylation (squares) sites in the large intracellular loop between putative transmembrane domains v
and vi (fig. 1). these potential posttranslational modifications are similar to those predicted for a variety of g-proteincoupled receptors (24, 25).  xxxg1112xxx  exhibits considerable
amino acid homology, particularly within the transmembrane
domains, with known 5-ht receptors that are coupled to the
inhibition of adenylate cyclase: human  xxxg1111xxx  ( xxxg1111xxx ), dog
 xxxg1110xxx , rat 5-ht1b, rat 5-ht1a, and rat 5-htic with 55%,
48%, 46%, 35%, and 30% overall identity. the primary amino
acid sequence of  xxxg1112xxx  is most closely related to the recently
described human  xxxg1111xxx  receptor (26), which has been identified
as the  xxxg1111xxx  (9). we screened a human genomic
library with rat  xxxg1112xxx  and determined the sequence of the
human  xxxg1112xxx  homolog, which is 86% and 93% identical to rat
 xxxg1112xxx  at the nucleic acid and amino acid sequence levels,
respectively. the human amino acids that differ from those
of rat are shown in italics in fig. 1. the relationships among
the known g-protein-coupled serotonin receptors are graphically illustrated as a dendrogram (fig. 2). the 5-ht1b and

of the rat  xxxg1112xxx  genomic clone. the putative transmembrane domains are underlined. triangles indicate potential n-linked glycosylation sites. the asterisk in line 2 is located above the intron splice
junction. the sequence upstream of this site in boldface print
represents the  xxxg1112xxx  cdna sequence, which is different from the

 xxxg1110xxx  receptors and the  xxxg1112xxx  and  xxxg1111xxx  receptors form
distinct subfamilies that are more similar to one another than
to other receptor types, as determined by amino acid sequence comparisons. in addition, the 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx ,
 xxxg1112xxx , and  xxxg1111xxx  receptors are more similar to each other
collectively than to 5-ht1a. this may be due in part to the
longer putative third intracellular loop in 5-ht1a compared
with the other receptors.
brain regional distribution of  xxxg1112xxx  mrna expression.
the tissue distribution of  xxxg1112xxx  expression could not be
determined by northern blotting because of the low expression of the mrna. however, we were able to take advantage
of pcr and the fact that the  xxxg1112xxx  gene contained an intron
in its 5' untranslated region. primers were designed so as to
amplify  xxxg1112xxx , producing a 563-bp fragment from cdna

 xxxg1112xxx  cdna. the  xxxg1112xxx  pcr product was detected in
approximately the following abundance: cortex = striatum =
hippocampus > thalamus = pons > hypothalamus > cerebellum. this distribution is consistent with known central
nervous system terminal fields for serotonergic pathways.
the abundance of  xxxg1112xxx  mrna in the cerebral cortex was
estimated to be approximately 0.0001% of total mrna,
based on the comparison of the pcr product formed from
cortex cdna template to the product formed from known
amounts of cloned  xxxg1112xxx  dna template. no pcr product
was detected with liver, kidney, or heart cdna templates.
to show that the pcr products were not the result of
amplification of genomic dna, the same hippocampus and
cortex mrnas used to make cdna template were additionally used as templates in pcr. these reactions did not yield
any products (lanes 12 and 13, fig. 3b).
expression and pharmacologcal analysis of  xxxg1112xxx . to
determine the pharmacological profile of this receptor, we
subcloned the gene into a eukaryotic expression vector
(pcmv4) and transfected cosm6 cells. broken cell preparations from transfected cells exhibited saturable 1251-lsd
binding that was competitively antagonized by 5-ht but not
by either of the two catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. saturation isotherm binding experiments demonstrated that 1251-lsd binds with high affinity (kd = 21.2 nm
± 5) to an apparent single class of noninteracting binding
sites.
table 1 shows the ic50 values for competition by a variety
of selective and nonselective 5-ht ligands for 125i-lsd
binding to  xxxg1112xxx  and the reported  xxxg1111xxx .  xxxg1112xxx 
demonstrated a high affinity for 5-ht, much like members of
the 5-ht1 subfamily. as predicted by the primary sequence
analysis,  xxxg1112xxx  exhibited a 5-htld-like pharmacology in that
it had affinity for sumatriptan but not 8-hydroxy-2(di-npropylamino)tetralin. however,  xxxg1112xxx  did not bind the
mixed 5-htla/ld agonist 5-ct.  xxxg1112xxx  also exhibited high
affinity for the ergot alkaloids ergotamine and  xxxd2621xxx .
125i-lsd binding to  xxxg1112xxx  was relatively unaffected by the
5-htlc/2-selective ligands methiothepin and mesulergine.
thus,  xxxg1112xxx  has a unique pharmacological profile, and its
affinity for 5-ht classifies it as a member of the 5-ht,

subfamily.

neurobiology: lovenberg et al.

the insensitivity of  xxxg1112xxx  to 5-ct was similar to that
observed for the reported human 5-htle receptor (12, 13).
leonhardt and coworkers (13) demonstrated that the putative
 xxxg1111xxx  had high affinity for 5-ht, ergotamine, and
 xxxd2621xxx  but not 5-ct. although the reported k, values
for ligand binding at the  xxxg1111xxx  were slightly
different than those for  xxxg1112xxx , the general trend was similar.
mcallister et al. (9) have recently cloned dna for a human
receptor that was identical to the  xxxg1111xxx  gene and have reported
that the pharmacology of the receptor matches exactly that
for the putative  xxxg1111xxx  (13). table 1 lists the k,
values for competition binding vs. tritiated 5-ht in cells
transfected with the  xxxg1111xxx  receptor gene. the  xxxg1111xxx 
is insensitive to sumatriptan, whereas  xxxg1112xxx  displays significant affinity for this ligand. in addition, the ergot alkaloids
 xxxd2621xxx  and ergotamine display lower affinity for the
 xxxg1111xxx  than for  xxxg1112xxx . it should be noted that our
binding assays used 125i-lsd, whereas the  xxxg1111xxx  studies
used tritiated 5-ht. these different agents may result in the
variations between affinity constants determined for the
ligands tested.
inhibition of adenylate cyclase. the primary structure of
 xxxg1112xxx  suggested that this receptor may be coupled to the
inhibition of adenylate cyclase through an inhibitory g-protein (gi)-like protein. this assumption was based on similarities among g,-coupled receptors, which tend to have longer
intracellular loops between transmembrane regions five and
six as well as shorter c-terminal tails compared with stimulatory g-protein (g.)-coupled receptors. we tested whether
 xxxg1112xxx  could mediate the inhibition of adenylate cyclase
induced by serotonin. in cells cotransfected with  xxxg1112xxx  and
the hamster ,82-adrenergic receptor, 10 ,um 5-ht elicited a 32
+ 6% (n = 3) decrease of  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated camp
accumulation. cells cotransfected with the rat 5-htla receptor, known to couple to g,, and the hamster 02-adrenergic
receptor exhibited a 53 ± 9% (n = 3) reduction in camp
accumulation in response to 10 um 5-ht. cells transfected
with the hamster p2-adrenergic receptor alone showed almost
no inhibition (8 ± 6%) in response to 10 um 5-ht. these
results show that  xxxg1112xxx  is capable of coupling in an inhibitory
manner to adenylate cyclase, presumably through a gi-like
mechanism.

conclusion
the data presented demonstrate that the  xxxg1112xxx  gene encodes
a 5-ht receptor protein that is expressed predominantly in
the central nervous system. the mrna distribution pattern
in the brain is consistent with terminal fields for some
serotonergic neurons.  xxxg1112xxx  couples to the inhibition of
adenylate cyclase and has a binding profile similar to that for
the  xxxg1110xxx  with the marked exception in affinity for
5-ct. interestingly, sumatriptan and ergotamine, both of
which exhibit high affinity for  xxxg1112xxx , have been shown to
have clinical efficacy for the treatment of migraine headaches
(for review, see ref. 27). this raises the possibility that the
action of these drugs may be mediated by more than one
subtype of 5-ht receptors.
lately, the identification of receptor genes has outpaced
traditional pharmacological identification. therefore, it has
become increasingly difficult to classify receptor gene products on a basis other than amino acid sequence. the pharmacological profile of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor protein is similar to
the previously identified  xxxg1111xxx  with regard to the
apparent insensitivity to the ligand 5-ct but differs with

proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 90 (1993)

regard to the affinity for sumatriptan. given that the sequence of  xxxg1112xxx  is most similar to  xxxg1111xxx , we propose that
the  xxxg1112xxx  gene be tentatively identified as another member of
the  xxxg1111xxx  subgroup.
note added in proof. the mouse homolog of this 5-htle-like
receptor has been reported (28).
