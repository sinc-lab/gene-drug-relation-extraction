summary. the quantitative differences between the activity of the 3 common phenotypes
of human red cell gpt has been confirmed. in addition, the activity of red cell  xxxg941xxx  was
found to be greater in young children than in adults. no such difference was found for the
 xxxg942xxx  phenotype. the activity of the red cell  xxxg941xxx  was found to decrease with age, reaching
the adult level at the age of 10 to 12 years. red cell gpt of all the 3 common phenotypes
in both adults and children was found to show a similar response to the addition of excess
 xxxd3047xxx .
a method has been devised for the partial purification of human gpt (cytoplasmic) from
liver.  xxxg941xxx  and  xxxg942xxx  have been purified, and very few significant differences were found
amongst the physical and kinetic parameters tested.

materials and methods
tissue extracts. most experiments were carried out using red cell haemolysates prepared
as follows. blood samples were collected into edta. the  xxxd187xxx  were washed three times
in 0.9~o smine, and the packed cells were diluted with an equal volume of distilled water. the
cells were haemolysed by ultrasonic disintegration. liver samples were obtained post mortem.
a small piece of liver was homogenised in four volumes of chilled water, the debris was spun
down, and the clear supernatant was used for electrophoretic analysis.
electrophoresis. ttorizontal starch gel electrophoresis was carried out at ph 6.8 using a
tris-citrate buffer. the bridge buffer was 0.2 1vftris titrated to ph 6.8 with a saturated solution of  xxxd1710xxx . the gels were prepared containing 11% starch in a 1 in 30 dilution of the
bridge buffer. the p i t of the starch/buffer mixture was checked and adjusted to ph 6.8 using
0.1 m tris. electrophoresis was carried out for 16 hrs  xxxd2274xxx  v/cm. the gels were sandwiched
between cooling plates through which water  xxxd1891xxx ~c was circulated.
staining. the gpt isoenzymes were detected using a modification of the procedure described by chen and giblett (1971). 200 mg dl alanine, 40 mg a-kctoglutarate, and 10 mg
~ xxxg1458xxx  were dissolved in 10 ml of 0.3 m tris/hc1 buffer ph 8.0. the ph of the solution was
checked and adjusted to p i t 8.0 with dilute naoh. 10 ~z lof lactate dehydrogenase (sigma
type 10--3000 units/ml) was added, and the stain was applied to the cut surface of the gel
by soaking onto two layers of filter paper. the gels were incubated at 37°c, and inspected

under a u.v. lamp (366 nm) for the presence of areas of defluorescence indicating the position
of the gpt isoenzymes. gpt in liver extracts were usually visible within 15 rain, whereas the
red cell gpt was not normally visible until after 2--3 hrs incubation.
enzyme assays. i n view of the very low activity of red cell gpt in comparison to the
enzyme from liver extracts, two different assay procedures were employed. both were based
on the same principle, namely the reduction of one of the products of gpt (pyruvate) b y
l d h and nadh~, and the monitoring of the disappearance of n a d h 2 in an ultraviolet
spectrophotometer a t 340 nm.
for the erythrocyte enzyme assay, a speetrophotometer cell (3 ml) was prepared as follows;
1.7 ml 0.3 m tris/ttc1 p  xxxd736xxx .0, 1.0 ml dl manine 20 mg/ml, 0.2 ml a-ketoglutarate 40 mg/ml
(ph 7.0), 0.1 ml -nadi-i2 3 mg/ml and 10 [11 of the haemolysate (1 volume water: 1 volume
 xxxd187xxx ). the contents of the cell were mixed and incubated for 5 min a t 45°c, after which
the absorbance at 340 n m was measured. the cell was incubated for a further 60 min at 45°c
and the absorbance at 340 n m measured. finally, the absorbance at 540 n m was measured
in order to determine the haemoglobin concentration. i t h a d been found from previous experiments t h a t it was not necessary to add ldh, there being sufficient of the enzyme in the
haemolysatc to reduce t h e p y r u v a t e produced during the reaction. enzyme activities are
expressed as international units/g haemoglobin at 45°c, a unit being the a m o u n t of gpt
causing the production of 1 tzmole of p y r u v a t e (and hence the loss of 1 ~mole of  xxxg1458xxx )
in 1 rain.
for the liver gpt assay, because of the possibility of producing an extract with far greater
enzyme activity t h a n a red cell lysate, a continuous assay (340 nm) can be carried out. i n
contrast to the red cell gpt assay, l d h is added, since in the later stages of the liver gpt
purification contaminating l d h will be removed. however, a complication arises due to the
presence of a m m o n i u m ions in the liver extract, and also in the l d h added to the assay.
the addition of a-ketoglutarate, n a d h 2 and ~nh~ provides b o t h the substrates and coenzymes
for the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase. g d h is present in liver extracts, whereas it is not
present in  xxxd187xxx . this means t h a t for the assay of liver gpt, the assay is carried out initially
in the absence of alanine, to measure g d h activity, and t h e n in the presence of manine to
measure b o t h gdi-i and gpt. the difference between the first and second assay is t a k e n as a
measure of the gpt activity. i n the later stages of the liver gpt purification, once gdh
activity has been removed, this problem does not arise.
a 3 ml spectrophotometer cell was prepared as follows; 1.5 ml 0.3 m tris/hcl p  xxxd736xxx .0,
0.2 ml a-ketoglutarate 40 mg/ml (ph 7.0), 0.1 ml nadh 2 3 mg/mi, 0.2 ml l d h (10 units/ml
in 50~o (nh4)2soi), and 10 ~zl of a suitably diluted liver extract. the decrease in absorbance
at 340 n m (gdh activity) was measured at a temperature of 30 ° c. 1.0 ml dl alanine 20 mg/ml
was added to the cell ~nd the decrease in absorbance a t 340 n m measured (gdk -~ gpt
activity).
all other technical methods will be described in the relevant section of the results.

difficult to detect. with this in mind, a project was started with the aim of

240

s. welch

measuring the frequency of quantitative variants of red cell gpt. blood samples
were collected from families and the gpt phenotypes, as shown by starch gel
e]ectrophoresis, were determined. the samples were assayed for red cell gpt.
i t was soon apparent from the results that an analysis of the red cell gpt
activity in families, with the aim of detecting the occurence and inheritance of
variant alleles causing reduced activity, would prove to be extremely difficult.
the reason being that superimposed upon the normal variation in gpt activity
within and between each of the 3 common phenotypes, was an increased gpt
activity in the children. 124 adults and 56 children were studied. the children's
ages ranged from 4 weeks to 7 years, the average being 14 months. the mean red
cell gpt activity of the children was found to be 0.738 units/g hb, as compared
to a mean value for the parents of 0.519 units/g itb.
i n view of the already known quantitative difference in gpt activity between
the 3 common phenotypes, the activity of the  xxxg941xxx  being 2--3 times higher
than the  xxxg942xxx , such a difference between the parents and children could be
due to a greater proportion of  xxxg941xxx  phenotypes amongst the children. an analysis
of the results from the starch gel phenotypes did not show any significant difference in gene frequency between the 2 groups (table 1). therefore the increased
gpt activity in the group of children could not be explained by an increased
proportion of  xxxg941xxx  phenotype.
the reason for the difference was discovered when the distribution of the red
cell gpt activity was plotted for each of the 3 phenotypes, and the results of the
adults and children then compared (fig. 1). the results for the adults are similar
to those already described (welch, 1972 a; chen et al., 1972; k6mpf and bissbort,
1974) with the activity of the gpt ] phenotypes being higher than the activity
of the  xxxg942xxx  phenotypes. the same was found to be true in the case of the children.
however, in the latter group, there seemed to be a higher activity of red cell gpt
amongst those children of the  xxxg941xxx  phenotype. the difference is more clearly
seen in table 2, where the mean activity of red cell gpt of the 3 phenotypes in
adults and children are compared.
whilst the mean activity of the  xxxg942xxx  phenotypes was found to be very similar
in adults and children, there is clearly an increased gpt activity in children of
the  xxxg941xxx  phenotype compared with adults. i t has been shown (welch, 1972a)
that the quantitative effects of the products of the  xxxg941xxx  and gpt ~ alleles are
additive. the mean activity of the  xxxg942xxx --1 phenotype can be predicted from
the results of the  xxxg941xxx  and  xxxg942xxx  phenotypes :

red cell gpt. 93 of the children were in this group. the results were divided into
2-year age groups and the mean red cell gpt activity of each of the 8 groups
was determined. the results are shown in graphical form in fig. 2. the results
clearly show a decrease in red cell gpt activity with age, with the mean adult
level of activity being reached by the age of 10--12 years. the results confirm
the initial observation made during the family study, namely that children of
 xxxg941xxx  phenotype and below the age of 2 years exhibit a red cell gpt activity
160% of that found in adults of the same phenotype.

 xxxd3047xxx  and red cell gpt activity
transaminase enzymes use  xxxd3047xxx  as a coenzyme. the coenzyme
is involved in the transfer of n i t 2 groups from an amino acid to a keto acid, the
reaction going via one or more schiff's bases.
one of the possible explanations that could account for either the difference
in activity between the products of the  xxxg941xxx  and  xxxg942xxx  alleles, or the difference
in activity of the product of the  xxxg941xxx  allele in adults and young children, is
that the enzyme from the various phenotypes and age groups shows a difference
in saturation with  xxxd3047xxx . a red cell lysate was prepared from an
adult of  xxxg941xxx  phenotype. the enzyme was assayed in the presence of various
concentrations of  xxxd3047xxx , ranging from 0.001 to 1.0 mm. the results
are shown in fig. 3. clearly the enzyme in the human erythrocyte is not fully
saturated with coenzymes. the addition of extra  xxxd3047xxx  causes an
increase in activity up to a level of 150--160°/o . further addition of coenzyme,
above the level of 0.1 mm does not cause any significant rise in red cell gpt
activity. assuming that 0.1 mm  xxxd3047xxx  causes maximal activation
of gpt, the addition of this concentration was tried on red cell lysates from adults
and children of all 3 common gpt phenotypes. the samples tested were from the
same group as shown in tables 1 and 2. the results, calculated as the percentage
activity in the presence of 0.1 mm coenzyme, are shown in table 3. the results
suggest that differences in the saturation of red cell gpt by  xxxd3047xxx 
do not explain either the differences in activity of the products of the  xxxg941xxx

fications of some of the steps in both these published procedures, plus other steps
arrived at as a result of many pilot experiments on human liver gpt. h u m a n
liver samples (approximately 250 g) were collected at post mortem. the gpt
phenotype was determined as described in the methods section. liver samples
from individuals of either the  xxxg941xxx  or opt 2 phenotype were stored at - - 2 0 ° c.
most of the steps in the purification were carried out at 4 ° c. protein concentration was measured by the  xxxd2444xxx  procedure.

step 1. 300 g of liver was homogenised in 1 1 of 0.02 m tris/0,1 m kc1/0.01 m
alanine/10 -t m mereaptoethanol : pi-i 8.0. the homogenate was raised to a temperature of 52°c in a boiling water bath, and then transferred to a water bath at
52°c and held at this temperature for 5 min. the h omogenate was cooled at
15°c and the ph adjusted to 6.3 with glacial acetic acid. the denatured protein
and cell debris was removed by eentrifugation at 5000 g for 30 min.
step 2. solid (nit4)2so 4 was added to the supernatant from step 1 to bring
the final concentration to 330/0. the precipitated protein was removed by eentrifugation at 10000 g for 30 min, and the snpernatant was brought to 55% satruation
by the addition of solid (nh4)zso 4. the precipitate was collected by centrifugation
at 10000 g for 30 rain and the supernatant was discarded.
step 3. the pellet from step 2 was suspended in 50 ml 0.005 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 6.0 containing 10 -4 m  xxxd26xxx , and dialysed against
10 1 of the same buffer. the dialysate was applied to a cm cellulose column
(50 x 2.5 cm) equilibrated against the same buffer. the column was elated with
1 1 of the phosphate buffer ph 6.0, then the ph of the buffer was adjusted to ph
6.6. the protein fraction eluted at this ph contained the gpt activity, and the
protein was precipitated by the addition of (nh4)~so 4 to 75% saturation. the
precipitated protein was collected by eentrifugation at 10000 g for 30 rain.
step 4. the pellet from step 3 was dissolved in 50 ml 0.01 m tris/10-~m
 xxxd26xxx  : ph 6.9, and dialysed against 2 1 of the same buffer. the sample
was applied to a d e a e cellulose column (50 × 2.5 cm), and elated with 200 ml
of the same buffer, during which time the gpt activity remained bound to the
column. the column was eluted with 500 ml 0.05 tris/10-~ m  xxxd26xxx /
10 mm alanine/1 mm ~-ketoglutarate: ph 6.4. the fractions containing gpt
activity were pooled and precipitated with solid (nh4)2so 4 to 75% saturation.
step 5. the pellet from step 4 was dissolved in 10 ml 0.02 m tris/0.1 m kc1/
10 -4 m  xxxd26xxx : ph 8.0, and dia]ysed against 1 1 of the same buffer.
the sample was applied to a sephadex g-200 column (50 × 1.5 em) and eluted
with the same buffer.
step 6. the fractions from step 5 containing gpt activity were pooled and
concentrated by pressure dialysis to a volume of 2 ml. the sample was re-cbromatographed on a sephadex g-200 column using the same conditions as in step 5.
the fractions containing gpt activity were pooled, assayed for enzyme and
protein, and stored in 50% (nh4)2so 4 at 4°c.
using the protocol described above, 5.2 mg of  xxxg941xxx  was prepared from 300 g
of liver. the purification procedure and results are summarised in table 4. a
similar procedure was carried out using 270 g of liver of a  xxxg942xxx  phenotype. i n
both cases the preparations were not homogeneous as shown by polyacrylamide

inhibition by amino-oxyacetate and maleate
in their studies on rat liver gpt, hopper and segal (1962) demonstrated that
amino-oxyaeetate and maleate both acted as competitive inhibitors, the former
being far more affective. since it has been shown that  xxxg942xxx  has a higher affinity
for the substrate alanine, one might expect that the 2 isoenzymes would show
differences in inhibition when the assays are carried out in the presence of either
amino-oxyaeetate or maleate. the activity of gpt was measured in the presence
and absence of amino-oxyaeetate (3.3 × 10-7m) and maleate (0.2 m). the results
are shown in table 5, confirming that at the same concentration of inhibitor, the
 xxxg942xxx  isoenzyme is inhibited to a lesser degree than the  xxxg941xxx  isoenzyme.
the kinetic experiments on the partially purified  xxxg941xxx  and  xxxg942xxx , whilst
failing to explain the reason for the lower activity of the  xxxg942xxx  allele product in
 xxxd187xxx , has provided some useful data showing differences in snbstrate affinity
and inhibition.
experiments are in progress to prepare  xxxg941xxx  and  xxxg942xxx  in a sufficiently pure
state to allow the structural difference between the two isoenzymes to be determined.

discussion
many of the red cell enzyme polymorphisms detected by means of starch gel
electrophoresis have subsequently been found to show quantitative differences
in enzyme activity. in a review of polymorphism in man, harris (1971) pointed
out that of 23 loci giving rise to eleetrophoretie variation, some form of quantitative variation had been found in 16 of these loci. such a common occurence of
quantitative variation was thought by harris to favour the view that these are
the consequences of natural selection rather than random drift. human red cell
gpt seems to be no exception. the quantitative difference in activity of the
product of the gpt ~ and  xxxg942xxx  allele has been well documented (welch, 1972;
chen et al., 1972; ksmpf and bissbort, 1974~) and has been confirmed in this
paper. the work described in the present paper has demonstrated a further
complexity, namely that the product of the  xxxg941xxx  allele is more active in young
children than in adults, whereas the activity of the product of the  xxxg942xxx  allele
does not vary with age. for example children of the  xxxg941xxx  phenotype and below
the age of 2 years were found to have levels of red ceil gpt activity 160% of that
of adults, and this activity was found to decrease with age and reach the adult
level by 10--12 years. these differences, not seen in the case of the  xxxg942xxx  phenotype, were not found to be due to an increased saturation of the enzyme from
young children by the cofaetor  xxxd3047xxx .
the role of gpt in human red cell metabolism is unlikely to be of any great
significance, the activity of the enzyme being so low in comparison to tissues like
the liver and heart. i t remains to be seen whether human liver cytoplasmic gpt
shows the same quantitative differences as the erythrocyte enzyme. liver gpt
is known to show variation in activity dependant upon age, hormone and diet.
chen et al. (1973) in a study of mouse liver gpt showed that the enzyme activity
in liver increased from 10 units to 300 units/g from the age of 12 to 26 days, the
latter age coinciding with the onset of weaning. rat liver gpt has been shown to
increase in activity under the influence of a variety of hormones including cortisol

a n d thyroxine, a n d also as a result of a high p r o t e i n diet (snell a n d walker, 1972).
one or more of the above factors could be implicated in the increased a c t i v i t y of
h u m a n g p t 1 in y o u n g children.
e x p e r i m e n t s carried out on the partially purified g p t from livers of a g p t 1
a n d g p t 2 p h e n o t y p e did n o t provide the i n f o r m a t i o n necessary to explain the
q u a n t i t a t i v e differences between the red cell g p t a c t i v i t y of adults of the 3
c o m m o n g p t phenotypes. most of the kinetic a n d physical parameters of the
g p t 1 a n d g p t 2 enzymes were found to be the same, the only exception being
a small difference in substrate affinity a n d competitive inhibition. e x p e r i m e n t s
designed to elucidate the n a t u r e of the molecular basis for the electrophoretic
differences between the products of the g p t 1 a n d g p t 2 alleles are in progress
