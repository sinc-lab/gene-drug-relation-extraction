summary--serotonergic transmission is thought to be central to the aetiology of depression and the
therapeutic actions of antidepressant drugs, and the latters' delayed effect has given rise to the hypothesis that
an adaptive change may be involved, possibly at the level of gene expression. we have examined this
hypothesis by treating rats over a time course of up to 32 days with either imipramine,  xxxd2637xxx , fluvoxamine,
citalopram,  xxxd160xxx  or saline and measuring the levels of mrnas encoding the 5htia, 5ht m, 5ht~c and
5ht2 receptors, the enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, and the 5ht
transporter. none of the treatments gave rise to significant changes in any of the mrna levels at any time
point. these results suggest that the reported changes in 5ht receptor numbers do not occur as a result of
changes in the abundance of their encoding mrnas, and that changes to the latter is not central to the
therapeutic effects of antidepressant drugs.

5ht2 function, and increased 5ht2 receptor sensitivity
as measured electrophysiologically (marsden, 1991;
peroutka and snyder, 1980; goodwin et al., 1984;
beasley et al., 1992). these findings are in general more
robust for the tricyclic antidepressants; reports on
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are less
consistent (johnson, 1991). however, down regulation
of 5ht2 receptor binding has been reported following
administration of citalopram, fluvoxamine and other
ssri's (johnson, 1991) and also  xxxd2637xxx  (green et al.,
1986).
the effects of chronic antidepressant exposure on
5hti receptor ligand binding are inconclusive (marsden,
1991) but functional studies indicate enhanced responsiveness of postsynaptic 5htia receptors (traber and
glaser, 1987) and reduced function at the 5htia autoreceptor (de montigny et al., 1984). however, a
major problem for 5ht receptor research is that few of
the allegedly specific ligands and drugs are specific
for receptor subtypes, and many have high affinity
for other classes of neuroreceptors. for example the
'specific' 5hte antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  also binds to
~1 adrenoreceptors and the  xxxd3330xxx  sensitive
 xxxg2099xxx  (wijngaarden et al., 1990). this
makes it difficult to make confident assertions about the
involvement of 5ht receptor types in behavioural and
ligand binding studies.

for the last 2-3 decades, the dominant hypothesis of
the pathogenesis of depression has proposed that there
is a dysfunction in central monoamine systems. the
evidence for this hypothesis largely originates from the
observation that all clinically effective antidepressant
drugs affect noradrenergic and/or serotonergic systems
(sulser, 1987). the simplest explanation as to how most
of these agents exert their effect is that they prevent
the breakdown of neurotransmitter (in the case of
monoamine oxidase inhibitors), or block the synaptic
re-uptake of monoamines, and, consequently boost
5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht) and nor-adrenalin (na)
transmission. one of the main obstacles to the acceptance of this view is that an increase in synaptic neurotransmitter takes place shortly after drug administration
yet clinical improvement in depression takes between
2-6 weeks to emerge. this has led to the hypothesis that
secondary regulatory mechanisms are responsible for
antidepressant efficacy.
although there are inconsistencies in the data, a
fairly constant observation across several classes of
antidepressants is that chronic exposure results in
reduced 5ht2 ligand binding, reduced measures of

in the last few years, several genes encoding 5ht
receptors and enzymes involved in 5ht synthesis have
been cloned, which has enabled us to study the effects of
antidepressant drugs on serotonergic transmission from
an alternative, but complimentary, angle. we have
measured the levels of mrnas encoding the 5htia,
5ht1b, 5htlc and 5ht 2 receptors, the enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase (tph) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx ), and the  xxxg2150xxx  ( xxxg2150xxx )
following the administration of imipramine,  xxxd2637xxx ,
citalopram, fluvoxamine and  xxxd160xxx  which represent
several different classes of antidepressant. imipramine
is the prototype re-uptake blocking tricyclic antidepressant, citalopram and fluvoxamine represent the
newer ssris, and both  xxxd2637xxx  and  xxxd160xxx 
represent atypical antidepressants.  xxxd2637xxx  is a
potent 5ht2 and 5htic receptor antagonist (hall and
ogren, 1981) which is thought to have little influence on
monoamine re-uptake in vivo.
the aim of the study was primarily to determine if
antidepressant drugs of several classes induced alterations in the expression of genes which are central to
serotonergic function. however, it was anticipated that
the study might have secondary implications. under
stringent hybridization conditions, each species of 5ht
receptor mrna can be detected with complete specificity. this approach has been successfully employed in
the past to study the regulation of dopamine receptor
isoforms (buckland et al., 1992a) and ),-aminobutyric
acid (gabaa) receptor subunits (o'donovan, 1992)
following antipsychotic and benzodiazepine treatment
paradigms respectively.

pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 10ml
ghc1. the precipitation from ghci was repeated a
total of four times and the final precipitate redissolved
in 1.2 ml water. the rna was reprecipitated from water
three times by the addition of 30 pl 3 m sodium acetate
(ph 5.7) and 2.5 ml ethanol followed by incubation at
4°c for 5 min, and centritgugation at 14000 g for 5 min
giving a typical yield of 1.1 mg.

methods

quantification of m r n a
each rat brain rna sample was analysed individually.
all bands measured on the autoradiographs were in the
linear range of the film used (hyperfilm mp; amersham,
u.k.), and this was corroborated by the use of a standard
curve an example of which is shown in fig. 1. the ratio
of band intensities of each probe relative to the fl-actin
probe were calculated for each sample, fl-actin is a
structural gene, commonly used as an internal standard
for gene expression studies. its expression is not affected
by any of the drugs used. the mean of the values obtained
for the five untreated samples was calculated. each of the
other ratios thus obtained was calculated as a percentage
of the mean of the untreated samples.

treatment of rats and preparation of rna
male wistar rats 3-4 months old, average weight
300g when killed, were used. five rats were used
per time point for each drug (in one cage) and group
housed with a 12 hr light/dark cycle at a constant
temperature of 20 + i°c. rats were injected i.p. with
0.5 ml of solution (see below) twice a day,  xxxd1891xxx  a.m. and
6 p.m. over a time course of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 days.
final injections were given  xxxd1891xxx  a.m. and the rats killed
4 hr later (to avoid any acute effects due to the injection
procedure) by inhalation of  xxxd2052xxx  and decapitation (day 1 rats are those killed 4 hr after the first
injection). the whole brain was removed and homogenized in a glass/ptfe tissue grinder with 20 ml gtc (5 m
guanidinium thiocyanate [fluka; > 97%], 50 mm tris
ph 7.5, 25 mm edta, 8% 2- xxxd26xxx ) at 0°c
and spun at 6000g for 40min. ethanol (10ml) was
added to the supernatant and the mixture incubated at
-20°c for 16hr followed by centrifugation at 6000 g
for 40 min. the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml ghc1
(6 m guanidine hydrochloride [fluka; >98%], 25 mm
edta, 10mm 2- xxxd26xxx ) and 5ml ethanol
added. the samples were incubated at -20°c for 3 hr,

multiprobe oligonucleotide solution hybridization (mosh)
oligonucleotide probes (severn biotech, kidderminster) were end labelled with polynucleotide kinase
using ~ 3:p-atp using standard procedures. probes
and rna were suspended in 30 pl hybridization buffer
[probe concentration 1 pmol/ml, 0.4 m nacl, 40 mm
pipes (1,4-piperazinediethanesulphonic acid) ph 6.4,
1 mm edta] heated at 90°c for 2 min and incubated
at 65°c for 2 hr. excess probe was then removed by
the addition of 300 #l s1 nuclease buffer [s1 nuclease
(amersham, u.k.) 120u/ml, zinc sulphate 4.5mm,
sodium acetate 50 mm, ph 4.2,  xxxd3213xxx  0.3 m,
10#g/ml single stranded dna] and incubation for
15 min at 37°c.  xxxd3426xxx  #1 aliquot of the reaction mixture
was transferred to a fresh tube, incubated at room
temperature (rt) for l0 min and the reaction terminated
by the addition of 48 #l 4 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m
edta. double stranded hybrids were precipitated
with ethanol, resuspended in l0/zl formamide running
buffer, denatured at 90°c for 2 min, subjected to acrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis and the dried gels
were analysed by autoradiography (exposure for 4
weeks) followed by scanning densitometry (ultrascan
densitometer, lkb).

depressive illness has long been thought to be due to
a deficiency in one or more of the monoamine neurotransmitters although there is a variety of hypotheses
concerning the aetiology of depression and an overactivity of a monoamine neurotransmitter may be
involved (strange, 1992). most drugs used to treat
depression are known to interact with the serotonergic
system and the term 'serotonin hypothesis' is sometimes
used. antidepressants are thought to act as 5ht agonists
by indirectly increasing the amount of neurotransmitter
in the synaptic cleft by blocking its reuptake or inhibiting its breakdown. however, this occurs shortly after
the drugs are administered whereas the antidepressant
effects are thought to take one to two weeks or longer
to develop. this has led to the idea that the therapeutic
action may be due to an adaptive change.
there is considerable and consistent evidence that
there may be changes in the abundance of 5ht2 receptors following the administration of antidepressants to
animals (roth et al., 1990; roth and ciaranello, 1991).
however, using ligand binding as a measure, not all 5ht
reuptake blockers appear to down-regulate the 5ht site
(fraser et al., 1988). however, both agonists (e.g.  xxxd2527xxx ) and antagonists (e.g.  xxxd2419xxx )
of 5 h t 2 receptors can cause down-regulation of responsiveness of the receptor but neither of the above are
established as antidepressants (fraser et al., 1988).
also, there is no evidence that depressed patients have
abnormal cortical 5 h t 2 receptor binding sites although
they may have decreased hippocampal 5ht l binding
sites (horton, 1992). direct measures of 5ht metabolites or receptors in the various tissues and fluids of the
body have failed to give decisive evidence of impaired
5ht neurotransmission (deakin, 1989). these observations suggest that 5 h t 2 receptor down regulation is
not central to the therapeutic action of anti-depressant
drugs.
our results indicate that the reported changes in the
abundance of the 5ht2 receptor do not occur as a result
of changes in the mrna levels. two other groups have
measured the levels of 5ht 2 receptor mrna following  xxxd2637xxx  treatment. roth and ciaranello (1991)
reported no change in 5 h t 2 mrna levels following
 xxxd2637xxx  15 mg/kg/day for 21 days. this group also
measured ligand binding to the 5 h t 2 receptor and did
find decreased ligand binding in the same experiments.
mengod et al. (1990) also reported no change in mrna
levels following  xxxd2637xxx  5 mg/kg/day for 15 days
whilst they too found decreased ligand binding in the
same experiments.
several possible explanations exist for the discrepancy
in previously reported ligand binding data and the
mrna results of roth and ciaranello (1991), mengod
et al. (1990) and ourselves. the simplest possible
explanation is that any alterations in the serotonergic
system occur by mechanisms other than the regulation

of steady state m r n a levels. although the expression of
a gene is generally primarily regulated by the abundance
of the specific m r n a s , alternative post-translational
regulation of protein levels has been well documented
(latchman, 1990). it must be noted also that the functional activity of a protein may be more important
with respect to behavioural effects than receptor numbers (smith et al., 1990), and effectors of 5ht receptor
function such as g proteins may be affected by antidepressants with respect to both protein and m r n a
abundance (lesch and manji, 1992).

the 5ht~c is pharmacologically and biochemically
similar to the 5ht 2 receptor and would more correctly
be classed as a 5ht2 subtype. 5htlc receptors are
distributed throughout the brain but are concentrated in
the choroid plexus. activation of the 5ht1c receptor
appears to have many effects including effects on mood
(curzon and kennett, 1990) and it is antagonized by
 xxxd2637xxx .  xxxd2637xxx  has been shown to cause a large
down regulation of 5htic receptor abundance but a
slight increase in its encoding m r n a levels (roth et al.,
1990). our results showing no change in 5ht~c m r n a

levels following drug treatment agree with those of
roth et al. (1990) as far as they are comparable and
again we must conclude that any changes in protein
abundance do not occur as a result of changes in the
mrna levels.
the 5htta receptor may be involved in anxiety and
depression (hensler et al., 1991). 5ht~a agonists such as
buspirone and its analogs have some efficacy in the
treatment of anxiety and also possibly depression. it is
thought that chronic treatment with both tricyclic and
ssri antidepressants enhances 5ht neurotransmission
by an effect upon 5htia receptors by different mechanisms: tricyclics are thought to increase the sensitivity of
5htia postsynaptic receptors (in the hippocampus and
medial temporal lobe) whereas ssris reduce the responsiveness of the somatodendritic and terminal 5htia
autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (blier et al.,
1990; marsden, 1991). welner et al. (1989) have reported
that the above affects may be due to increased or
decreased abundance of the 5htia receptor respectively
in the brain areas above. however hensler et al. (1991)
report that none of a range of antidepressant drugs
affects the abundance of 5htia receptors in rat brain
and yates and ferrier (1990) have reported that in post
mortem studies antidepressant treatment has no significant effect on the abundance of 5htia receptors in
human brain (although sample numbers were small).
our results indicate that any change in the abundance of
the 5htia receptor which may occur is not as a result
of changes in the encoding mrna.
tryptophan hydroxylase (tph) is thought to be the
rate limiting step in the synthesis of serotonin, converting tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan which is in
turn converted into 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) by
aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx ). however
neither tph nor  xxxg618xxx  is normally saturated; the
production of 5-hydroxytryptophan being regulated by
the availability of tryptophan. oral administration of
tryptophan increases the synthesis of 5ht but it is not
clear if this results in an increase in the release of 5ht
into the synapse. however, orally administered tryptophan does potentiate the effects of both monoamine
oxidase inhibitor and tricycle antidepressants (malizia
and bridges, 1992). although it is not thought that
antidepressants affect the activity of these two enzymes,
it is possible that any perturbation of the serotonergic
system may cause compensatory changes in their activity
even though this may not change the presynaptic concentration of 5ht. in similar experiments to those
described above we have found that some antipsychotic
drugs markedly increase the abundance of  xxxg618xxx 
mrna, although neither the mechanism behind this nor
the biochemical consequence of this increase are clear
(buckland et al., 1992b). our results show that none of
the drugs used changed the abundance of either of these
enzyme mrnas, adding weight to the hypothesis that
the synthesis of 5ht is not affected by antidepressants
although it must be borne in mind that we cannot rule

out an effect by antidepressants, indirect or otherwise,
on the availability of tryptophan.
serotonin reuptake or transport sites have been
reported to be reduced in platelets of patients suffering
from depression and also in post mortem brain samples
from depressed patients and suicide victims although
other workers have failed to find this (cooper and kelly,
1992). most of the antidepressant drugs used in this
study are thought to inhibit the reuptake of 5ht and at
least in the case of ssri's this is thought to be their
principal site of therapeutic action. however, as this
blockade occurs shortly after drug administration and
before the therapeutic effects are apparent the two may
not be connected. clearly, however, any effects following
chronic drug treatment on the abundance and function
of the  xxxg2150xxx  may be important.
although there have been suggestions that chronic
 xxxg2150xxx  blockade causes a down regulation of the  xxxg2150xxx 
site (e.g. hrdina, 1987) in a review of the subject
marcusson and ross (1990) conclude that there is no
evidence of changes in either  xxxg2150xxx  activity or protein
abundance following treatment with antidepressants
including ssri's. also, a recent study by kovachich
et al. (1992) concludes that ssri's do not exert consistent or substantial regulatory effects on the abundance of
the  xxxg2150xxx . however, lesch et al. (1993) have studied the
effects of a range of drugs on the mrna levels of the
 xxxg2150xxx  in the raphe nuclei of rat brains. they report that
fluoxetine and imipramine down-regulate the  xxxg2150xxx 
mrna at the 0.05 significance level. although not
significant they also report a quantitatively similar down
regulation by desipramine and clomipramine and a
smaller down regulation by the monoamine oxidase
inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx , and the 5ht agonists rnchlorophenylpiperazine
and
l-(2,5-dimethoxy-4iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane. it is usually considered to
be axiomatic that antagonism of a system will cause a
homeostatic change to compensate for that antagonism.
thus an upregulation of  xxxg2150xxx  sites following chronic
inhibition would be expected. our results are in contrast
to those of lesch et al. (1993) and suggest that the
abundance of the  xxxg2150xxx  encoding mrna is not changed
by the drugs. until clear evidence of the down regulation
of  xxxg2150xxx  sites by chronic antidepressant treatment is
produced our results rather than those of lesch et al.
(1993) would appear to support the dominant theory
that  xxxg2150xxx  sites are not regulated by these drugs.
in conclusion we have found no change in the levels
of mrna encoding the  xxxg1108xxx , 5htm, 5htlc or 5ht 2
receptors or the enzymes tph and  xxxg618xxx  or the
serotonin transporter, following exposure to  xxxd2637xxx ,
imipramine, fluvoxamine, citalopram,  xxxd160xxx  or
saline control. these results suggest that the reported
changes in 5ht receptor numbers do not occur as
a result of changes in the abundance of their encoding
mrnas. it should be noted however, that as whole
rat brain rna was used, differential regional changes
may not have been detected. also the role of the

effect of antidepressant drugs on levels of mrnas
serotonergic system in both the aetiology o f depression
and the clinical m o d e o f action o f anti-depressant drugs
is far from clear and it is possible that changes in
the abundance o f other m r n a s , e.g. those encoding
adrenergic system proteins m a y have clinically i m p o r t a n t
effects.
