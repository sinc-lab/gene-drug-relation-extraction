abstract
 xxxd2995xxx  is a selective cysteinyl leukotriene1 ( xxxg599xxx )
receptor antagonist, and is now widely used in the treatment of asthma. the anti-asthmatic effect of  xxxd2995xxx 
may be rendered not only by antileukotriene activity, but
also by other pharmacological activity. this study was
designed to investigate whether  xxxd2995xxx  had inhibitory effects on nuclear factor-îb (nf-îb) activation and
mucin gene expression in cultured human epithelial
cells. luciferase assay was mainly used for analysis. cultured epithelial cells were transfected with nf-îb luciferase vector,  xxxg1484xxx  or muc5ac luciferase vectors. lipopolysaccharide (lps) significantly increased nf-îb activation in nci-h292 cells, which was inhibited by the pretreatment by  xxxd2995xxx  in a dose-dependent manner.
either ltd4 or  xxxd2995xxx  alone did not increase nf-îb
activation in nci-h292 cells.  xxxd2995xxx  also inhibited

nf-îb activation induced by phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13acetate (pma).  xxxd2995xxx  also significantly inhibited
lps-induced  xxxg1484xxx  mrna expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis in
nci-h292 cells.  xxxd2995xxx  also inhibited lps-induced
 xxxg1484xxx  gene expression in  xxxg449xxx - xxxg1484xxx  cells. however,
 xxxd2995xxx  did not inhibit muc5ac gene transcription
activity induced by lipoteichoic acid (lta) in nci-h292
cells. these results suggest that  xxxd2995xxx  may inhibit
nf-îb activation and  xxxg1484xxx  gene transcription through
pathways distinct from  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonism in
cultured human epithelial cells.

introduction

cyslts are important mediators of human bronchial
asthma [1], and activate  xxxg599xxx  receptor and cyslt2
receptor [2, 3].  xxxg599xxx -receptor activation by ltd4 results in contraction and proliferation of smooth muscle,
edema, eosinophil migration and damage to the mucus
layer in the lung [1, 4, 5]. in normal human lung, expres-

materials and methods
reagents
p. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (lps) from serotype 10, phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from
staphylococcus aureus were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo.,
usa). leukotriene d4 (ltd4) was obtained from cayman chemical (ann arbor, mich., usa).
cell culture
nci-h292 cells, a human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line, were purchased from the american type culture collection (rockville, md., usa) and maintained in rpmi-1640 medium
(sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (gibco brl, grand
island, n.y., usa), 5 ml penicillin-streptomycin mixed solution
(nacalai tesque, kyoto) in humidified atmosphere with 5% carbon
dioxide at 37 ° c. the day before each experiment, cells were seeded
into 24-well tissue culture dishes at the density of 1.0 ! 105/well. for
the evaluation of effects of  xxxd2995xxx , the cells were incubated with
various concentrations of  xxxd2995xxx  for 6 h before the stimulation by
lps, lta and ltd4.
an  xxxg449xxx  cell was a sub-clone of the ls174t adenocarcinoma cell
line.  xxxg449xxx  cells stably transfected with  xxxg1484xxx  promoter (–2864/+19)
pgl2 (promega, madison, wisc., usa) luciferase construct (hm3muc2) were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin
(100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 ìg/ml).
transfection and reporter gene assay
pnf-îb luciferase vector was purchased from clontech (palo
alto, calif., usa). nci-h292 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (105 cells/well) and left for 24 h in rpmi-1640 medium
plus 10% fbs. transfection was performed in accordance with the
instructions of the manufacturer. briefly, 0.2 ìg dna, 1.2 ìl
fugene 6 (roche, indianapolis, ind., usa), in 20 ìl optimen
(gibco brl) reduced serum medium was added to each well. after
24 h, the rpmi 1640 medium was replaced. then serum-free
medium, stimulants and  xxxd2995xxx  + stimulants were added to the
transfected cells. luciferase activity was measured using dual-luciferase reporter assay system according to manufacturer’s recommendations (promega). briefly, 100 ìl of lysis buffer was added to
each well and plates were agitated for 15 min at room temperature.
20 ìl of supernatant was added to 100 ìl luciferase assay reagent and
light units measured for 10 s on luminescence-psn (bio-instrument
atto, bunkyo, tokyo). luciferase activity was normalized with
respect to relative light units emitted from serum-free, mediumtreated controls.
rt-pcr analysis for  xxxg1484xxx  mrna
cultured cells were homogenized in denaturing solution (4 m
guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% sarcosyl, 0.1 m
2- xxxd26xxx ). then we followed a single-step method of rna
isolation by chomczynski. rna pellets were resuspended in 20 ìl of
10! buffer and incubated with 1 u of dnase i at 37 ° c for 30 min to
distinguish rna from contaminating genomic dna. the rna was
extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1; v/v/v),
ethanol precipitated, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, rinsed
with 70% ethanol and dried. the rna pellets prepared as above
were reverse transcribed into cdnas using geneamp rna pcr kit
(takara biomedicals, tokyo, japan). oligo d (t) primer was used for

sion of the  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna was confined to
smooth muscle cells and tissue macrophage, with minimal
receptor mrna detected in epithelial cells lining the airway lumen [6].
 xxxd2995xxx  (8-[p-(4-phenylbutyloxy) xxxd98xxx ] amino-2[tetrazol-5-yl]-4-oxo-4h-1-benzopyran hemihydrate) is a
selective  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonist [7]. it is effective in
reducing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and allergen-induced bronchoconstriction. it has been reported to exhibit not only antileukotriene activity but also other pharmacological effects [8, 9]. it is shown that  xxxd2995xxx  attenuates lps-induced acute lung injury in guinea pigs [9]. and
it is also reported that  xxxd2995xxx  inhibited the lpsinduced airway hyperreactivity in guinea pigs [8]. the
authors [8] concluded that cyslts were not important in
the development of lps-induced bronchial hyperreactivity and  xxxd2995xxx  suppressed lps-induced bronchial hyperreactivity by some other mechanism.
recently, it was shown that cyslts induce  xxxg1559xxx  activation and  xxxd2995xxx  significantly inhibits  xxxg1559xxx  activation in isolated lung mononuclear cells in a murine model
of asthma [10]. moreover, it was reported that  xxxd2995xxx 
attenuates allergen-specific  xxxg2296xxx  alpha
production and nf-îb nuclear translocation in peripheral blood monocytes from atopic asthmatics [11] and that
this drug also inhibits  xxxg1559xxx  activation in jurkat t cells
[12].
therefore, we expected that  xxxd2995xxx  had some antiinflammatory effects in mucus-producing epithelial cells.
nf-îb is a ubiquitous and important transcription factor
for genes that encode proinflammatory cytokines such as
interleukine-1 (il-1), il-6, il-8 and tnf-· [13–17]. activation of nf-îb results in the binding of specific promoter elements and expression of mrnas for proinflammatory cytokine gene. in order to examine the inhibitory
effects of  xxxd2995xxx , we investigated the effects of  xxxd2995xxx  on nf-îb activation induced by lps and pma in
cultured human airway epithelial cells.
it is reported that activation of nf-îb is required for
 xxxg1484xxx  induction by pseudomonas aeruginosa lps in epithelial cells [18].  xxxg1484xxx  is one of the mucin genes, and it
is expressed in the tracheal and nasal goblet cells as well as
small and large intestines [19]. mucins are major constitutive glycoproteins of mucus and give its viscoelastic, gellike property. excessive mucus production characterizes
airway disease, such as chronic bronchitis, asthma, cystic
fibrosis, chronic sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis. we hypothesized that  xxxd2995xxx  also had inhibitory effects on
lps-induced  xxxg1484xxx  activation as wells as nf-îb activation.

rt-pcr analysis for  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna
total rna was extracted from nci-h292 cells and  xxxg449xxx - xxxg1484xxx 
cells and was reverse transcribed as above. pcr were performed with
a thermal cycler under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 94 ° c for 5
min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 1 min denaturation at 94 ° c,
1 min annealing at 60 ° c, and 2 min extension at 72 ° c. the
sequences of the 5) sense primers and the 3) antisense primers synthesized based on published sequence data [20] and used in this study
were as follows:  xxxg599xxx , sense, 5)-gacagccatgagctttttcc-3), and antisense, 5)-atgcacccagagacaaggtt-3)
(product size, 514 bp). as a positive control, genomic dna extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes was used.
statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean b se of triplicate samples from six
different experiments for luciferase assays. for rt-pcr analysis,
data are expressed as mean b se of eight samples for each group.
the statistical significance of the data was evaluated by means of
mann-whitney’s u test.

nci-h292 cells. nci-h292 cells were stimulated by ltd4,  xxxd2995xxx , or lps for 2 h. when  xxxd2995xxx  was used in combination with
other stimulants,  xxxd2995xxx  was administered 6 h earlier than
administration of ltd4 or lps. the cells were then subjected to the
luciferase assay as described.

cells induced a significant activation of nf-îb (fig. 1).
this effect of lps was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of cells with  xxxd2995xxx  (fig. 1). in this experiment,
lps was administered after 6 h incubation with  xxxd2995xxx .  xxxd2995xxx  inhibited nf-îb luciferase activity at the
dose of 10 –6 m and 10 –7 m, compared to lps alone
(fig. 2). incubation of the cells with  xxxd2995xxx  at a concentration of 10 –6 m for 8 h had no significant cytotoxicity to nci-h292 as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion
(data not shown).

nci-h292 cells were stimulated by 0.25 ìm pma for
2 h instead of lps in the same experimental design. pma
significantly increased nf-îb luciferase activity (fig. 3).

generation of cdnas. after incubation at 42 ° c for 30 min, the samples were heated for 5 min at 99 ° c to terminate the reactions and
were stored at –20 ° c until used. oligonucleotide primers were
designed from the published cdna sequences. the sequences
of primers are 5)-catggaggcccccggggagtgctg-3)
( xxxg1484xxx , sense), 5)-tgtcccgcaggacccggagcaatg-3)
( xxxg1484xxx , antisense), 5)-atggatgatgatatcgccgcg-3) (ß-actin, sense) and 5)-atgtcgtcccagttggtgacgat-3) (ß-actin,
antisense). fresh tubes containing the upstream and downstream
primers (25 ìm of each primer) spanning the given sequence for
amplification, 200 ìm of each dntp, 50 mm kcl, 10 mm tris-hcl
(ph 8.3), 1.5 mm mgcl2, 1 u of thermus aquaticus (taq) dna
polymerase were heated to 94 ° c, and 1 ìl of cdna was added to a
final volume of 50 ìl. the reaction mixture was then added 1 drop of
 xxxd2648xxx  and amplified in perkin-elmer/cetus (norwalk, conn.,
usa) thermal cycler. the amplification profile consisted of 30 cycles
of denaturation at 94 ° c for 45 s, primer annealing at 62 ° c for 2 min
and extension at 72 ° c for 1 min. the reaction was terminated by
chilling at 4 ° c. the pcr products were electrophoresed through a
2% (w/v) agarose gel. band intensities were measured by a densitometer.
previous studies have shown that the amount of amplified fragments is proportional to the quantity of input mrna during the
exponential phase of the amplification process. we have also varied
the number of cycles of amplification to determine the point at which
amplification is within the exponential phase. we confirmed that the
amplification of both  xxxg1484xxx  and ß-actin mrnas remained in the
exponential phase at 30 cycles.

rt-pcr analysis showed a single band about 500 bp
in  xxxg449xxx -muc cells and the positive control, but not in

fig. 7.  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna is expressed in  xxxg449xxx - xxxg1484xxx  cells
but not in nci-h292 cells. the expression of  xxxg599xxx  receptor mrna
was examined by means of rt-pcr. genomic dna extracted from
peripheral blood leukocytes was used as a positive control.

our study, 10 –6 and 10 –7 m  xxxd2995xxx  clearly inhibited lps-induced nf-îb activation in nci-h292 cells.
transcription factors are components of the signal transduction machinery that act in the nucleus to promote the
transcription of genes, leading to the de novo production
of proteins [21, 22]. they are expressed in multiple cell
types and play a dominant role in the transcription of
many immune-related genes. it is reported that immunostaining of inflamed lung shows high levels of nuclear nfîb in lung epithelium and leukocytes [23, 24]. inhibition
of nf-îb may provide a powerful means for down-regulating many of the molecular events that culminate in
inflammation and structural damage of the lung.
for the evaluation of effects of  xxxd2995xxx , the cells
were incubated with  xxxd2995xxx  for 6 h.  xxxd2995xxx  was
incubated for such a long time because incubation with
 xxxd2995xxx  for 2 h had less inhibitory effects. this is probably because inhibition by  xxxd2995xxx  is not by  xxxg599xxx 
receptor antagonism but by another mechanism, which
results in  xxxg1559xxx  inhibition.
in nci-h292 cells, ltd4 did not induce nf-îb activation or increase  xxxg1484xxx  gene expression. similar observations have been reported in human monocytes and t
cells. tomari et al. [11] reported that  xxxd2995xxx  signifi-

cantly inhibited tnf-· production and nuclear translocation of nf-îb in peripheral blood monocytes of atopic
asthmatics and that ltd4 did not induce tnf-· production or nf-îb nuclear translocation. ichiyama et al. [12]
reported that ltc4, ltd4 or lte4 did not induce nf-îb
activation in human monocytic u-937 cells and that  xxxd2995xxx  inhibited nf-îb activation in u-937 and jurkat t
cells. it is known that u-937 cells express  xxxg599xxx  receptor
but jurkat t cells do not. absence of  xxxg599xxx  mrna
expression in nci-h292 cells suggests lack of  xxxg599xxx 
receptor or its very low expression. therefore, inhibition
of nf-îb activation by  xxxd2995xxx  in nci-h292 cells may
be independent of  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonism.
in the study using 48 healthy volunteers, the plasma
 xxxd2995xxx  concentration after oral administration of
225 mg was cmax 446 ng/ml [25], which is around 10 –6 m.
our results suggest that therapeutic  xxxd2995xxx  administration at usual dose has an anti-inflammatory effect by
inhibition of nf-îb activation. we also stimulated ncih292 cells with pma, and showed that  xxxd2995xxx  also
inhibited pma-induced nf-îb activation. phorbol esters
such as pma function as tumor promoters and have been
reported to modulate diverse cellular responses such as
gene transcription, cellular growth and differentiation,
programmed cell death, the immune response and receptor desensitization, through protein kinase c (pkc) signal
pathways. pma can substitute for diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator of pkc, and it has been used as a
model agent to study the mechanisms utilized by growth
factors, hormones and cytokines to regulate growth and
differentiation of cells [26– 28]. our present study suggests that  xxxd2995xxx  may have inhibited common signaling molecules of lps- and pma-induced nf-îb activation. probably,  xxxd2995xxx  may have inhibited raf-1mek1/2- xxxg1369xxx /2-pp90rsk pathway, because both lps
and pma have that signaling pathway [18, 29].
it is reported that neutrophils play a critical role in
development of lps-induced airway disease [8, 12, 30].
ishizaka et al. [9] described that  xxxd2995xxx  attenuates
lps-induced acute lung injury, and this effect appears
mainly as a result of its potent antagonistic actions against
peptide leukotrienes and also, in part, the suppression of
neutrophil chemotaxis. uno et al. [8] reported that secondary release of tnf in response to lps contributes to
bronchial hyperreactivity, and  xxxd2995xxx  suppresses
lps-induced tnf production and neutrophil chemotaxis.
we used lps and pma to stimulate  xxxg1484xxx  gene transcription, because pma and lps are known to increase
 xxxg1484xxx  transcription. when  xxxg1484xxx  gene transcription is

upregulated by pma or lps, nf-îb is activated in both
cases [18, 29]. in the present study, ltd4 did not increase
 xxxg1484xxx  gene expression but  xxxd2995xxx  significantly inhibited lps-induced  xxxg1484xxx  gene expression in nci-h292
cells. this suggests that inhibition of  xxxg1484xxx  gene expression by  xxxd2995xxx  may be independent of  xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonism. whether or not  xxxd2995xxx  suppresses
nf-îb itself or its upstream is currently unknown. it is
generally accepted that lps stimulate inflammatory responses through toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 [31]. tlr4 can
activate a signaling pathway which sequentially activates
irak, traf6, i-îb kinase complexes and nf-îb [31].
therefore,  xxxd2995xxx  may suppress irak, traf6 or iîb kinase complexes, which eventually inhibits nf-îb
activation.
 xxxd2995xxx  failed to suppress muc5ac gene transcription induced by lta. this is because the signaling pathway for muc5ac is different from that for  xxxg1484xxx . it is
known that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase is required for muc5ac transcription, whereas
activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-akt pathway
leads to down-regulation of muc5ac transcription via a
negative cross-talk with p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathway [32]. thus, the absence of nf-îb involvement in muc5ac signaling pathway may explain lack of
effect of  xxxd2995xxx  for inhibition of muc5ac gene
expression induced by lta.

clinically,  xxxd2995xxx  is now widely used for the patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis. it is reported that
 xxxd2995xxx  significantly decreased eosinophil infiltration
and il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ,  xxxg363xxx , il-1ß,  xxxg2296xxx -·,
and il-8 production in human nasal mucosa of perennial
allergic rhinitis [33].  xxxd2995xxx  also suppressed the production of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , and gm-csf by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells under stimulation with specific antigens in patients with bronchial asthma [34]. recently,
 xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonists have been used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids [34]. tomari et al. [11]
reported that  xxxd2995xxx  and dexamethasone significantly
inhibited nuclear translocation of  xxxg1559xxx  in peripheral
blood monocytes of atopic asthmatics. they also demonstrated an additive effect of  xxxd2995xxx  on low-dose dexamethasone.
in conclusion,  xxxd2995xxx  inhibits nf-îb activation
induced by lps and pma in nci-h292 cell. furthermore,  xxxd2995xxx  also inhibits lps-induced  xxxg1484xxx  expression in both nci-h292 cells and  xxxg449xxx - xxxg1484xxx  cells.
these inhibitions by  xxxd2995xxx  may be independent of
 xxxg599xxx  receptor antagonism.
