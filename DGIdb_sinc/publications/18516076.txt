background and purpose:  xxxg720xxx  (epo) catalyses the formation of oxidants implicated in the pathogenesis of
various respiratory diseases including allergy and asthma. mechanisms for inhibiting epo, once released, are poorly
understood. the aim of this work is to determine the mechanisms by which melatonin, a hormone produced in the brain by
the pineal gland, inhibits the catalytic activity of epo.
experimental approach: we utilized h2o2-selective electrode and direct rapid kinetic measurements to determine the
pathways by which melatonin inhibits human epo.
key results: in the presence of plasma levels of bromide (br), melatonin inactivates epo at two different points in the classic
peroxidase cycle. first, it binds to epo and forms an inactive complex, melatonin-epo-br, which restricts access of h2o2 to the
catalytic site of the oxidation enzyme. second, melatonin competes with br and switches the reaction from a two electron
(2e) to a one electron (1e) pathway allowing the enzyme to function with catalase-like activity. melatonin is a bulky
molecule and binds to the entrance of the epo haem pocket (regulatory sites). furthermore, br seems to enhance the affinity
of this binding. in the absence of br, melatonin accelerated formation of epo compound ii and its decay by serving as a
1e substrate for epo compounds i and ii.
conclusions and implications: the interplay between epo and melatonin may have a broader implication in the function of
several biological systems. this dual regulation by melatonin is unique and represents a new mechanism for melatonin to
control epo and its downstream inflammatory pathways.

introduction
eosinophils are white blood cells produced in the bone
marrow and migrate to various tissues on a regular basis
(klebanoff et al., 1983; ackerman et al., 1985). they play an
essential role in host defences through their ability to release
toxic substances to kill parasites (klebanoff et al., 1983;
ackerman et al., 1985). they also play a role in tissue
surveillance and allergic responses (rothenberg 1998; holt
et al., 1999). eosinophils are found in higher numbers in
asthmatic airways (klebanoff et al., 1983). eosinophil
peroxidase (epo) is secreted from eosinophilic granules
during phagocyte activation (jong et al., 1980; klebanoff

mayeno et al., 1989; slungaard and mahoney, 1991;
samoszuk et al., 1994; rothenberg 1998). epo is a monomeric haemoprotein comprised of light and heavy chains
with molecular masses of 15.5 and 50 kda, respectively
(bolscher et al., 1984a). epo and related mammalian
peroxidases (such as myeloperoxidase (mpo) and  xxxg1338xxx ) use h2o2 as the electron acceptor in the catalysis of
oxidative reactions, which have a role in generating
inflammatory injury and cardiovascular diseases (jong
et al., 1980; klebanoff et al., 1984; mayeno et al., 1989;
slungaard and mahoney, 1991). the enzyme catalyses the
formation of a cytotoxic and antimicrobial chemical,
hypobromous acid (hobr), by oxidation of bromide (br)
as a favoured substrate (bolscher et al., 1984a; arlandson
et al., 2001). indeed, epo is the only human enzyme known
to selectively generate reactive brominating species in
physiological concentration of halides (wu et al., 1999;

melatonin and mammalian peroxidases
t lu et al

macpherson et al., 2001). brominated products can serve as
markers to identify sites of epo-mediated oxidative damage
(henderson et al., 2001).
 xxxg720xxx -fe(iii) reacts rapidly with h2o2 and
generates a ferryl p-cation radical (epo-fe(iv) ¼ o þ p) intermediate compound i (weiss et al., 1986; mayeno et al., 1989;
wu et al., 1999; mitra et al., 2000). compound i is capable of
oxidizing either br through a two-electron (2e–) transition,
generating epo-fe(iii) and hobr, or oxidizing multiple
organic and inorganic molecules by two successive sequential
one-electron (1e–) transitions, generating their corresponding
free radicals and the peroxidase intermediates compound ii
(e-fe(iv) ¼ o) and e-fe(iii), respectively (weiss et al., 1986;
mayeno et al., 1989; mitra et al., 2000). compound ii is a
longer lasting intermediate whose decay to epo-fe(iii) is
considered to be the rate-limiting step during steady-state
catalysis (mitra et al., 2000). acceleration and decay of
compound ii formation have been noted with a series of
organic and inorganic substrates and physiological reductants
like  xxxd2738xxx  and superoxide (mitra et al., 2000; abu-soud
et al., 2001; abu-soud and hazen, 2001; galijasevic et al., 2007).
melatonin ( xxxd2559xxx ) is a ubiquitous neurohormone, synthesized from the amino
acid tryptophan and secreted by the pineal gland in the
brain. it is involved in numerous aspects of biological
and physiological regulation, including circadian entrainment, blood pressure regulation, oncogenesis, retinal
physiology, seasonal reproduction, ovarian physiology
and immunity (gastel et al., 1998). its synthesis and release
are stimulated by darkness and suppressed by light
(wurtman et al., 1963; brown, 1994; arendt et al., 2000;
herxheimer and waterhouse, 2003; herxheimer and
petrie, 2004; malhotra et al., 2004; hardeland, 2005;
schaffazick et al., 2005). it can inhibit h2o2-induced lipid
peroxidation and lipoprotein modification. however, the
possible in vivo reaction pathways for these properties
have not yet been identified (hardeland, 2005;
schaffazick et al., 2005).
melatonin is thought to act as a potent anti-inflammatory
reagent through its action as an antioxidant and free-radical
scavenger in both in vivo and in vitro (hardeland, 2005). it
plays an important role in protecting cell membranes from
lipid peroxidation, neutralizing hydroxyl radicals and may
bind to dna, promoting further protection beyond antioxidant activity. melatonin may stimulate some important
antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and  xxxg981xxx  (hardeland,
2005).
synthetic melatonin supplements, administered orally or
by intramuscular injection, have been used for a variety of
medical conditions, most notably for disorders related to
sleep (goldman, 1995; altun and ugur-altun, 2007). these
uses have been tested in humans or animals. safety and
effectiveness have not always been proven. a wide range of
melatonin doses has been used, including ‘low dose’
(0.1–1.0 mg) for jet lag and insomnia in the elderly,
‘moderate doses’ (5 and 10 mg), often taken by mouth
30–60 min prior to sleep time for sleep disturbances in
children with neuropsychiatric disorders and bipolar
disorder, or ‘high dose’ (50–1200 mg) for treating cancer

1309

and migraine headaches (goldman, 1995; altun and
ugur-altun, 2007).
despite the potential significance of epo to both human
health and disease, little is known about the factors that
downregulate its activity and function. in this report, we use
a combination of h2o2-selective electrode, optical absorbance and rapid kinetics measurements to show that
melatonin is an effective inhibitor of epo.

methods
enzyme purification
human epo was purchased from lee biosolutions inc.
(st louis, mi, usa). the enzyme was isolated using a
modification of the method of jorg et al. (1982), using
guaiacol oxidation as the assay. purity of isolated epo was
established by demonstrating a reinheitzal (rz) value of
40.85 (a412/a280). sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
with coomassie blue staining and gel tetramethylbenzidine
peroxidase staining was performed to confirm no contaminating mpo activity (van dalen et al., 1997). an extinction
coefficient of 112 000 m1 cm1 per haem of epo was used to
determine the final epo concentration used in each experiment (bolscher et al., 1984b; carlson et al., 1985).

h2o2-selective electrode measurements
h2o2 measurements were carried out using an h2o2selective electrode (apollo 4000 free radical analyzer; world
precision instruments, sarasota, fl, usa). experiments were
performed at 25 1c by immersing the electrode in 3 ml of
200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7, under air. h2o2 at a
concentration of 20 mm was added to a continuously stirred
buffer solution containing various concentrations of melatonin and/or br (70 mm) during which the rise and fall of
h2o2 concentration was continuously monitored. where
indicated, 20 ml epo (15 nm final) was added to the reaction
mixture. to determine the effect of melatonin on h2o2
consumption by epo, similar experiments were repeated by
adding 20 ml of the enzyme solution (15 or 60 nm final) to a
continuously stirred h2o2 solution in the absence and
presence of various concentrations of melatonin.

absorbance measurements
spectra were recorded with a cary 100 bio uv-visible
spectrophotometer, at 25 1c, in the phosphate buffer ph 7
(see above). experiments were performed with a 1 ml cuvette
containing epo (0.7–1.0 mm) preincubated with increasing
concentrations of melatonin (6–200 mm), in the absence
and presence of 70 mm br. concentrated volumes of h2o2
solution were added to the sample cuvette (20 mm final) and
absorbance changes were recorded from 300 to 700 nm.

were performed with a dual-syringe stopped-flow instrument
obtained from hi-tech ltd (model sf-61, tgk scientific
limited, bradford on avon, uk). experiments were initially
performed under conditions identical to those recently
reported for epo and other related haemoproteins to
facilitate comparison (galijasevic et al., 2004, 2006; proteasa
et al., 2007). measurements were carried out under an aerobic
atmosphere  xxxd1891xxx  1c following rapid mixing of equal
volumes of an h2o2-containing phosphate buffer solution
and a peroxidase solution containing 70 mm br and/or
different melatonin concentrations. reactions were monitored at both 412 and 432 nm. the time course of the
absorbance change was fitted to a single-exponential,
y ¼ 1ekt, or a double-exponential y ¼aek1t þ bek2t)
function as indicated. signal-to-noise ratios for all kinetic
analyses were improved by averaging at least six to eight
individual traces.
in some experiments, the stopped-flow instrument was
attached to a rapid scanning diode array device (hi-tech)
designed to collect multiple numbers of complete spectra
(200–800 nm) at specific time ranges. the detector was
automatically calibrated relative to a holmium oxide filter,
as it has spectral peaks at 360.8, 418.5, 446.0, 453.4, 460.4,
536.4 and 637.5 nm, which were used by the software to
correctly align pixel positions with wavelength. rapid
scanning experiments involved mixing solutions of peroxidase (1–2 mm) preincubated with 200 mm br in the
absence or in the presence of increasing (7–200 mm) melatonin concentrations with the phosphate buffer containing
40 mm h2o2,  xxxd1891xxx  1c.

solution preparation
a stock solution of melatonin was dissolved in dimethylformamide and then diluted to the required concentration
with the phosphate buffer (ph ¼ 7). the final concentration
of dimethylformamide in all melatonin solutions used was
less than 1% and had no effect on epo reactions.

materials
melatonin, h2o2, sodium bromide and dimethylformamide
used were of the highest purity grades and obtained from
sigma-aldrich (st louis, mo, usa).

results
ability of melatonin to inhibit epo catalytic activity
we initially used an h2o2-selective electrode to determine
how melatonin regulates the catalytic activity of epo and its
role in substrate switching, steering the catalytic activity of
epo from a 2e to a 1e oxidation pathway. as a control, we
first tested whether melatonin alone and in combination
with a plasma level of br has an effect on h2o2 autoreduction rate. following addition of 20 mm h2o2 (final) to
the continuously stirred reaction mixture, the h2o2 signal
rose rapidly, achieved a maximum after b30 s and fell
gradually as h2o2 was depleted by auto-reduction (figure 1,
dashed line). addition of different concentrations of

presence of br. a typical recording by an h2o2-selective electrode
demonstrating auto-reduction of h2o2 (20 mm) following addition
to stirred phosphate buffer (200 mm; ph 7) supplemented with
70 mm br, at 25 1c (dashed line). addition of 20 ml (15 nm final
concentration) of epo solution to the h2o2/br stirred buffer caused
rapid h2o2 consumption. addition of 20 ml (15 nm final concentration) epo solution to the h2o2/br solution supplemented with
increasing melatonin concentrations 4, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 18 mm (solid
lines from left to right, respectively) causing slower h2o2 removal.
tracings shown are from a typical experiment performed at least
three times. epo,  xxxg720xxx .

melatonin (7, 14, 28, 50 and 100 mm) and/or plasma
concentration of br (70 mm) to a stirred h2o2 buffer solution
had no or little effect on h2o2 auto-reduction rates,
indicating that melatonin alone did not significantly consume h2o2 (data not shown).
addition of epo (20 ml, 15 nm final concentration) solution
to a continuously stirred h2o2 (20 mm) buffer solution
supplemented with 70 mm br caused rapid consumption of
h2o2 (figure 1). under these circumstances, epo metabolized br through a 2e oxidation pathway generating hobr.
the rapid disappearance of h2o2 did not occur in the
presence of saturating amounts of melatonin (420 mm
melatonin). instead a much slower rate of h2o2 consumption (figure 1) indicated that melatonin might have a role in
inhibiting the catalytic activity of epo. in the presence of
sub-saturated amounts of melatonin (o20 mm melatonin),
epo catalysed a slow reduction of h2o2, which did accelerate
upon melatonin oxidation. when the same experiments
were repeated by adding higher epo concentrations (for
example, 60 nm), the h2o2 consumption rates were significantly increased, the duration of the reactions decreased and
the trend by which melatonin inhibited epo stayed the same
(data not shown).
for comparison, the above experiments had been repeated
in the absence of the competing co-substrate, br. addition
of 60 nm epo to the reaction mixture caused an immediate
rapid decay in the level of free h2o2, followed by a slower
decay, indicating that h2o2 was consumed as a substrate by
epo during steady-state catalysis, as previously reported
(figure 2a; tahboub et al., 2005). the first step occurred
immediately after enzyme addition and is attributed to the
formation of epo compound i. the second step is much
slower and is attributed to the reaction of epo with h2o2
after the conversion of epo compound ii to epo-fe(iii).
decreasing the concentration to 15 nm epo caused slower

disappearance of h2o2 (figure 2a). addition of 20 ml epo
(15 nm final concentration) to continuously stirred h2o2
(20 mm) buffer solutions supplemented with increasing
melatonin concentrations increased the rate of h2o2 consumption (figure 2b), indicating that melatonin served as a
1e substrate for both epo compounds i and ii.

rapid kinetic measurements
we used stopped-flow spectroscopy to examine the effect of
melatonin on the distribution of epo intermediates during
steady-state catalysis. the reactions were initiated  xxxd1891xxx  1c by
mixing an aerobic solution of epo-fe(iii) in the absence and
presence of increasing concentrations of melatonin with a
solution of h2o2. upon initiating the reaction, we observed
an initial rapid decrease in absorbance in the first 10 ms that
can be attributed to epo compound i formation. this was
followed by an increase in absorbance at 432 nm over the
next 3 s that can be attributed to the formation of epo
compound ii (figure 3a). similar results were obtained in the
presence of 10 mm melatonin (final), except that the conversion rate constants of compound i to compound ii were
progressively accelerated with increasing melatonin concentration (figure 3b). at higher melatonin concentrations, the

1311

figure 3 melatonin accelerates the conversion rates of epo
compound i to compound ii. absorbance spectra of epo recorded
by diode array stopped-flow in the absence (a) and in the presence
of 10 mm (b) and 160 mm melatonin (c). experiments were performed
under aerobic conditions when a phosphate buffer solution
(200 mm, ph 7) containing 1.6 mm epo in the absence and presence
of 20 and 320 mm melatonin was rapidly mixed with a buffer solution
supplemented with 40 mm h2o2  xxxd1891xxx  1c as described under
methods. the time of each collected spectrum after initiating the
reaction is indicated in each figure in seconds. arrows indicate the
direction of spectral change over time. the dashed line spectrum
represents the enzyme as isolated. epo,  xxxg720xxx .

rate of the absorbance decrease at 412 nm was essentially
identical to the rate of absorbance increased at 432 nm (data
not shown), suggesting that epo binds to melatonin and its
dissociation from the melatonin–epo complex is the ratelimiting step of the overall reaction (figure 3c).
single-wavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy was also
used to highlight melatonin’s influences on epo compound
ii formation, complex duration and decay. investigations
were carried out by rapid mixing of epo-fe(iii) solution
preincubated with increasing concentrations of melatonin
(for example, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mm) against 40 mm h2o2.

duration and decay of epo compound ii collected at 432 nm

increasing melatonin concentrations. in the presence of 5 mm
melatonin, there was a fast build-up of epo compound ii,
which remained at the same level for around 800 s, and
decayed through a biphasic reaction to the ferric form with
apparent rate constants of 0.08 s1 for the faster phase and
0.005 s1 for the slower phase (figure 4). between 5–7% of
the total absorbance changes at 452 nm were associated with
the fast phase. the amplitude of the first phase increased,
while that of the second phase decreased upon increasing
melatonin concentration. only the faster phase was
observed at higher melatonin concentrations (figure 4). in
all cases, conversion of epo compound i to compound ii
was best fitted to a single-exponential function. figure 5
shows the relationship between melatonin concentration

and the rate of epo compound ii formation (figure 5a),
duration of its formation (figure 5b) and the rate of complex
decay (figure 5c). it was evident as melatonin’s concentration increased the formation of epo compound ii and its
decay rate constant progressively increased in a linear
manner. the second-order rate constant of epo compound
ii formation (kon) calculated from the slope was
1.60  106 m1 s1, while first-order rate, calculated from
the intercept, was similar to that measured in the absence
of melatonin (3 s1). the second-order rate constant of epo
compound ii decay calculated from the slope of figure 5c
was 1.00  103 m1 s1, while the first-order rate calculated
from the intercept was similar to that found in the absence
of melatonin (0.001 s1). epo compound ii duration
decreased in a linear and saturable manner. collectively,
these results may suggest that melatonin serves as a 1e
substrate for both epo compounds i and ii.

reaction changes the distribution of epo intermediates

that were either higher or lower than h2o2 concentrations.
addition of h2o2 to epo solution in the presence of 100 mm
br caused rapid small decreases in absorbance at 412 nm,
followed by instant recovery (figure 6a), indicating that
the decay of epo compound i is faster than its formation.
when the same reactions were repeated in the presence of
saturating amounts of melatonin (200 mm), epo-fe(iii) converted directly to compound ii without any sign of
compound i accumulation (figure 6b). when the melatonin
concentration used was less than h2o2 concentration (for
example, 10 and 20 m), the majority of epo-fe(ii) was
converted to compound ii, which then decayed to epofe(iii) upon melatonin oxidation.
finally, we examined the influence of melatonin on the
kinetics of epo compound ii build-up, duration and decay
during steady-state catalysis in the presence of plasma levels
of the competing substrate br. reactions were performed by
following rapid mixing of epo preincubated with various
concentrations of melatonin (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mm

substrate br (100 mm final) against 40 mm h2o2. initiation of
the reaction resulted in a significant increase in the amount

b0.64-fold decrease in the decay rate of compound ii was
observed.
in addition, we observed a significant increase in epo

these results clearly demonstrate that melatonin competes
with a plasma level of br and switches the reaction from a
2e to a 1e oxidation. when the same reactions were
monitored at 412 nm, the direction of absorbance change
reversed, but otherwise proceeded with identical kinetics
(not shown).

discussion
evidence suggests epo-mediated reactive oxidants promote

matory conditions such as allergy and asthma. melatonin
may have a beneficial role in modulating the pathogenesis
of several disorders by inhibiting epo catalytic activity and
function. our current results not only highlight the
potential role of melatonin in inhibiting epo, but also
emphasize the role of br in this inhibition. in the presence
of br, the efficiency of melatonin in inhibiting epo
is enhanced probably due to stabilization of the
br–epo–melatonin complex. formation of such a complex
restricts the access of h2o2 to the catalytic site of the enzyme
and limits the overall epo catalytic activity by the removal
of melatonin from the complex by either dissociation or
oxidation. this behaviour was evident by direct conversion
of epo-fe(iii) to compound ii, decrease in the second-order
rate constant of compound ii accumulation and restoration
of catalytic activity upon melatonin exhaustion. when
melatonin dissociated from the complex, it accelerated the
formation of epo compound ii and its decay to the ground
state by serving as a 1e substrate. the ability of melatonin
to compete with plasma levels of br and serve as a 1e
substrate of epo compounds i and ii drives the enzyme to
function with catalase-like activity.
our results did not exclude the possibility that the br–
epo–melatonin complex might have reacted directly with
h2o2 generating compound ii and the oxidized form of
melatonin. in the absence of br, melatonin served as a 1e
substrate of epo compound i and accelerated its conversion
to compound ii. collectively, our results suggest a bidirectional relationship that links epo and melatonin, which may
have a much broader application in biological systems. the
present studies support the notion that the formation of the
br–epo–melatonin complex during steady-state catalysis is a
fundamental feature of the kinetic reactions of epo under
these experimental conditions. its formation and decay
accelerate the removal of the h2o2 from the epo milieu.
this is particularly important in the human airway, where
catalase, a major h2o2 scavenger, is present at very low levels
(erzurum et al., 1993), thus leaving mammalian peroxidases
to serve as the major h2o2 scavenger at this site.
the x-ray structure of epo is presently unavailable.
however, using rapid kinetic measurements, no binding to
epo haem iron and a theoretical epo three-dimensional
model built on the scaffold of the  xxxg1338xxx  x-ray
structure, we have recently shown that br binds at two
different binding sites on epo (galijasevic et al., 2007). both
sites have distinct effects on the epo haem iron microenvironment. melatonin is a bulky aromatic molecule that may
influence epo steady-state catalysis by binding to the
entrance of the hydrophobic pocket of the distal haem
cavity, preventing access of h2o2 to the catalytic site of the
enzyme. our current results are consistent with this
hypothesis, since inhibition of epo requires occupation of
both catalytic sites of epo. previous electron paramagnetic
resonance (epr) and x-ray structure simulations have
demonstrated that aromatic molecules bind near the haem
centre of mpo (hori et al., 1994). the hydroxamic side
chains of salicylhydroxamic acid and benzohydroxamic acid
seem to interact with the haem iron (hori et al., 1994). the
docking calculations carried out by hallingbäck et al. (2006)
also showed that the indole substituent and/or the indole

ring moieties of the substrate positioned at the mpo haem
edge. these finding are consistent with mpo being able to
oxidize melatonin through 1e pathway reactions (allegra
et al., 2001; ximenes et al., 2005). our current findings
provide further evidence for an allosteric coupling between
melatonin, epo haem pocket entrance binding (regulatory)
site and the catalytic centre that induces detectable inhibition of epo. they also provide a new role for br in
facilitating melatonin binding that mediates epo inhibition.
the apparent ability of br to stabilize the epo–melatonin
complex is unprecedented, and it may be governed by a
mechanism involving communication between the two
binding sites of the enzyme. melatonin significantly inhibited h2o2 consumption in levels that govern both (patho)physiological, and supplemental ranges (van den heuvel
et al., 1998; altun and ugur-altun, 2007). a steady-state
competition model that describes the modulating effects of
melatonin on epo inhibition in the presence of br is shown
in figure 9. epo compound i was the first intermediate that
was formed in the catalytic cycle. its formation is relatively
fast, with a second-order rate constant of 4.3  107 m1 s1 at
10 1c (ximenes et al., 2005). epo compound i oxidizes br,
the physiological substrate for epo (furtmuller et al., 2000),
in a single 2e reaction, leading to formation of epo-fe(iii)
and hobr. the high rate of br catalysis was associated with
undetectable compound i build-up and minimal decrease in
the soret absorbance peak during the steady-state catalysis.
in the absence of br and during turnover, compound i is
converted to compound ii both spontaneously by 1e leak
(from endogenous electron donors) and more rapidly in the
presence of melatonin, which serves as an exogenous 1e
reductant. in the absence of br, epo consumes h2o2 by
immediate rapid decay in the level of free h2o2, followed by
a much slower decay (tahboub et al., 2005). the first step
occurs immediately after epo addition and is attributed to
multiple cycles of h2o2 consumption prior to conversion of
epo compound i to compound ii. our results showed that
melatonin was able to constrain this reaction by accelerating
conversion of compound i to compound ii. formation of
compound ii, the inactive form of epo, limits h2o2
consumption rate by the slow conversion rate of epo

1315

compound ii to epo-fe(iii). in the presence of br, only
the first phase is observed, indicating that epo catalyses the
formation of hobr. hobr is a highly active compound,
possessing potent bactericidal and viricidal activities (weiss
et al., 1986; mayeno et al., 1989; mitra et al., 2000).
in the presence of sub-saturating amounts of melatonin,
the transformation that is apparent from our h2o2-selective
electrodes may represent a switch in subcycles (figure 9). the
first step in h2o2 consumption is limited by the rate of
melatonin dissociation from the br–epo–melatonin complex when the reaction is initiated by adding epo solution to
melatonin/br/h2o2 mixture. in this case, the second step of
h2o2 consumption is the peroxidation reaction after the
release of melatonin from the melatonin–epo–br complex
by either oxidation or dissociation to generate inhibitor-free
epo. under the latter circumstances, the enzyme generates
hobr. thus, the variation in the binding affinity of epofe(iii) towards melatonin and the release of melatonin from
the epo–melatonin complex due to its oxidation accounts
for the inflection point in the h2o2 consumption rate.
the finding that oxidation of melatonin can restore the
catalytic activity of epo is very intriguing. more importantly,
oxidized melatonin had no biological harmful sequelae and
no effect on the epo activity. the maximum stoichiometry
value obtained for melatonin in h2o2 consumption was
approximately a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that epo compound i
partitions between two subcycles as during catalysis. it could
oxidize br and melatonin by a 2e and 1e pathway,
respectively. the rate of melatonin oxidation and degree of
compound ii formation may both depend on melatonin
bioavailability. indeed, increasing melatonin concentration
not only increases the amplitude of epo compound ii
formation, it also increases the duration of its formation. our
data indicated that formation of compound ii occurs much
faster than its decay. thus, the bioavailability of melatonin
versus br, the affinity of epo compound i towards
melatonin versus br and the decay rate of epo compound
ii are all likely to determine the amount of epo compound
ii that builds up during steady state. the different activities
of epo are best appreciated in the context of figure 9.
compound ii complex formation is intrinsic to catalysis and

causes a majority of the enzyme to partition into catalaselike activity. thus, inactivation of epo and its duration can
be controlled effectively by melatonin supplementation.
melatonin is currently associated with improved outcome
when used to treat jet-lag, disturbances of sleep, lowering of
blood pressure, cancer, longevity and even improving sex life
(goldman, 1995; altun and ugur-altun, 2007). melatonin
has been found to acts as one of the most effective
antioxidants through its ability to neutralize and scavenge
hydroxyl radicals known to induce dna damage (reiter,
1995; cuzzocrea and reiter, 2001; kücükakin et al., 2008).
due to the relatively low physiological levels of melatonin in
human tissue, melatonin has been recommended as a
supplement for a wide variety of conditions in daily doses
ranging from 0.3 to 1000 mg given for 1–4 weeks (goldman,
1995; zhdanova et al., 1995). epo, like mpo, is released into
the extracellular space as eosinophils degranulate in the lung
tissues during inflammation (andreadis et al., 2003). inhibition of epo by sufficient amounts of melatonin may have a
beneficial effect in vivo. our current study uses concentrations of melatonin that have been shown to induce a
biological effect in human cells and tissues, without any sign
of toxicity or side effects (goldman, 1995). thus, the results
of this study suggest a potential role for melatonin in the
treatment of various inflammatory disorders.
normal plasma levels of melatonin in human subjects
are approximately 2.5–50 pg ml1, but they increase to
1700 pg ml1 (7 nm) within 60 min of consumption of 5 mg
orally (mero et al., 2006). as melatonin can be metabolized
through several pathways to various components, it is
important to measure the levels of melatonin and its
metabolites in the blood (hardeland and pandi-perumal,
2005). n(1)-acetyl-n(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (afmk)
is the major metabolite of melatonin, accompanied by
6-hydroxymelatonin, sulphatoxymelatonin and glucuronic
acid conjugates. the high variable first-pass metabolism of
melatonin after oral administration can be one of the factors
that limit measuring its serum levels. various methods, such
as immunoassays, liquid and gas chromatography and
capillary electrophoresis, were used to measure serum melatonin concentrations. only the sulphated fraction has been
measured by immunoassay to determine the quantitative
level of the metabolite. the hepatic metabolism of oral
melatonin cannot be measured using this assay, because
approximately 20% goes undetected as the glucuro
nidated fraction. härtter et al. (2001) developed a method
using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, which
showed
relatively
lower
melatonin
concentration
(19.2 ng ml1; 0.1 mm) versus a higher concentration of its
6-hydroxy metabolite (694 ng ml1; b3 mm) in human plasma 1 h after ingestion of 20 mg of melatonin. thus, melatonin
and its metabolites should all be taken in consideration when
evaluating the overall melatonin concentration in biological
systems. the lower melatonin concentrations used in our
current study are comparable to plasma 6-hydroxy metabolite
concentrations detected by others (härtter et al., 2001).
higher doses of melatonin (420 mg) can probably result in
greater serum concentrations of melatonin and its metabolites, close to those we used in our experiment. we believe
that the concentrations used in these studies may have
british journal of pharmacology (2008) 154 1308–1317

pharmacological relevance in inflammatory diseases. further
investigation is needed to elucidate the bidirectional relationship between various doses of melatonin and epo in vivo.
collectively, melatonin and peroxidase activities are
apparently coupled through complex and interdependent
pathways. our results clearly show that br facilitates
melatonin binding to the enzyme, which in turn inhibits
the catalytic activity of the enzyme. epo may be functioning
as a scavenger for melatonin limiting its bioavailability and
function. this may subsequently modulate the negative
effects of sleep loss on various body functions. on the other
hand, melatonin may have an important role in the
inhibition of epo activity in various tissues during inflammation. the biological consequences of melatonin–peroxidase interactions may have broad implications in the
regulation of sleep, inflammation, infectious and cardiovascular disorders in vivo.
