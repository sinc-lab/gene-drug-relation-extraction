summary-the high affinity binding

of the phencyclidine
derivative [‘h]tcp to cortical membranes
of
the rat was investigated.
in an extensively washed membrane preparation
the binding of [rh]tcp was
enhanced in the presence of l-glutamate
and nmda. the stimulation
of the binding of [‘h]tcp by
l-glutamate
was inhibited competitively
by  xxxd1353xxx  and non-competitively
by mk801. the binding of
[3h]tcp was also enhanced in the presence of glycine; this effect was insensitive to strychnine and inhibited
non-competitively
by  xxxd1353xxx . saturation experiments demonstrated
that mksoi was a competitive inhibitor
of the binding of [3h]tcp.
these results suggest that [jh]tcp binds to a site similar to that which binds mk801; this site may
be associated with the ion channel of the nmda receptor.

receptors.

excitatory amino acids such as  xxxd2431xxx  are
thought to interact with several distinct classes of
receptors within the mammalian central nervous system and spinal cord (mclennan, 1988; watkins and
evans, 1981; foster and fagg, 1984). these receptors
can be classified on the basis of their sensitivity to the
selective agonists n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda),
kainic acid and  xxxd3068xxx . at the present time
it is not known whether glutamate and aspartate are
the only endogenous compounds with activity at
these receptors (do, herrling, streit, turski and
cuenod, 1986; zaczek, koller, cotter, heller and
coyle, 1983). the study of  xxxg981xxx  systems has been aided by the identification of a number
of synthetic analogues of glutamate which act as
competitive antagonists at excitatory amino acid
receptors. whilst many of these are not selective for
subtypes of receptors, the phosphonic acid derivatives aminophosphonopentanoic
acid ( xxxd1353xxx ) and
3-[( f )-2 carboxypiperazin-4-yllpropyl1-phosphonic
acid (cpp) are both highly selective for the nmda
subtype of receptor (evans, francis, jones, smith
and watkins, 1978; davies, evans, herrling, jones,
olverman, cook and watkins, 1986).
electrophysiological experiments have suggested
that the nmda receptor may be associated with an
ion channel which is permeable to calcium and
sodium (macdermott and dale, 1987; ascher and
nowak, 1987). it has recently become apparent that
several drugs may interact with this ion channel and
inhibit responses to nmda in a non-competitive
manner. these antagonists include the dissociative
anaesthetic phencyclidine (pcp) (lodge and berry,
1984) and the anticonvulsant
(+)-5-methyl- lo,lldihydro - 5h - dibenzo [ a,d] cyclohepten - 5,10 - imine

(mk801) (kemp, priestley and woodruff, 1986);
[‘hi-mk801 has been shown to bind to a site associated with the nmda receptor complex which is
distinct from the binding site for glutamate and may
represent binding to a site on the ion channel (foster
and wong, 1987). in membranes from the brain of
the rat, phencyclidine appears to interact with at least
two distinct binding sites, the first of these, the
phencyclidine-sigma site, is labelled by some (sigma)
opiates, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-n-n-propylpiperidine
(3-ppp) and haloperidol (gundlach, largent and
snyder, 1986; vignon, privat, chaudieu, thierry,
kamenka and chicheportiche, 1986; downes, lewis
and stone. 1986). this site can be differentiated
pharmacologically and anatomically from a second
site, the phencyclidine-nmda site which may represent an interaction with the nmda receptor complex
(maragos, chu, greenamyre, penney and young,
1986; fagg, 1987).
in the present study the binding of [3h]tcp, a
derivative of phencyclidine of increased potency and
specificity, to rat brain membranes was examined.
the binding was characterised in terms of interactions with the nmda receptor complex, and the
effects of nmda receptor agonists and antagonists
have been described. in addition, the effects of glycine
and related amino acids, which may also act as
allosteric modulators of the nmda receptor complex (johnson and ascher, 1987) have been examined.

results

in well-washed
membranes
of cerebral cortex of
the rat the binding of [3h]tcp was saturable and
inhibited by the specific nmda receptor antagonists
 xxxd1353xxx  and mksol. the addition of  xxxd2431xxx  to
these membrane
preparations
resulted in a marked
stimulation of the binding of [3h]tcp, giving a 24
fold increase above basal levels. the maximum effect
of glutamate
was seen in membranes
washed five
times in 20 volumes of buffer immediately
before
assay; however, in later experiments it was noted that
washing in larger volumes (100 x ) resulted in an even
greater (up to 6 fold) stimulation
of the binding of
[3h]tcp. under these conditions,
the concentration
of glutamate was reduced from 40nmol/mg
protein
in the p, pellet to 0.2 nmol/mg protein in the frozen
pellet and 0.12 nmol/mg protein in the final preparation.

acid (ampa, 10 p m), a selective  xxxd3068xxx  receptor agonist. the stimulation by 1opm nmda was
not significantly different from the maximum stimulation by glutamate (fig. 1).
the stimulatory effect of glutamate was inhibited
by  xxxd1353xxx  (10 and 30 /j m) in an apparently competitive
manner (fig. 2a). it can be seen from figure 2(a)
that  xxxd1353xxx  also lowered the basal level of binding of
[-‘h]tcp. in contrast to  xxxd1353xxx , mk801 (10 and 30 nm)
inhibited the binding of [3h]tcp in a noncompetitive manner (fig. 2b). once again the basal
binding of [3h]tcp was inhibited by mk801.
the inhibition of the binding of [3h]tcp by
mk801 and phencyclidine was studied in the presence and absence of added glutamate (fig. 3). in the
absence of glutamate the i& for mk801 was
65 k 25 nm (n = 3); in the presence of 1opm glutamate this value was reduced to 12 f 3 nm
(mean + sd, n = 3). in contrast the ic,, of phencyclidine in the presence of 10pm glutamate
(275 f 90 nm) was not significantly different from the
i& in the absence of glutamate (470 f 205 nm).

(fm 1

the results of the present study suggest that
13h]tcp binds to a site associated with the nmda
receptor complex. in well-washed cortical membranes the binding of [‘h]tcp was enhanced in the
presence of  xxxd2431xxx  and nmda but not by the
presence of kainic acid or ampa, a selective agonist
of the “ xxxd3068xxx  preferring” receptor. both the
basal levels of the binding of [ih]tcp and the
giutamate-stimulated
binding of [‘h]tcp were inhibited by the specific nmda receptor antagonist
aps. autoradiographic studies have shown that in
rat the distribution of the binding of [‘h]tcp is very
similar to that of the binding of [3h] glutamate to the
nmda receptor (maragos et al., 1986, gundlach et
al., 1986), with the exception of the cerebellum. in

saturation analysis of the binding of [3h]tcp in
the presence or absence of 10 p m  xxxd2431xxx 
demonstrated that the increase in the binding of
[3h]tcp was due to both an increase in the number
of binding sites and the affinity (fig. 6a). glycine
(10 pm) increased the number of binding sites for
[‘h]tcp and also increased the affinity; the effect of
glycine on affinity (&) was less pronounced than that
of glutamate. the number of binding sites for
13h]tcp in the presence of 10 p m  xxxd2431xxx  was
not s~gni~cantly different from the number of binding
sites for [3hftcp in the presence of iopm glycine

in the binding assay would be no greater than
ioonm.
this concentration
of glutamate
was
sufficient to cause a significant enhancement
of the
binding of (‘h]tcp, and it is interesting to note that
in the absence of added glutamate both  xxxd1353xxx  and
mk801 markedly inhibited the binding of [)h]tcp.
the stimulation
of the binding of [-‘h]tcp by
glutamate was antagonized
by  xxxd1353xxx  in a competitive
fashion.
at lopm,
 xxxd1353xxx  markedly
inhibited
the
stimulation
by glutamate,
which agrees well with
published values for the inhibition of the binding of
[3h]glutamate to the nmda receptor by  xxxd1353xxx  and
also for the inhibition of the glutamate stimulation of
the binding of [‘h]mk801 (fagg and matus, 1984;
monaghan
and cotman,
1986; foster and wong,
1987; olverman, monaghan,
cotman and watkins,
1984). in contrast
to  xxxd1353xxx , mk801 inhibited
the
stimulation by glutamate of the binding of [3h]tcp
in a non-competitive
manner with respect to glutamate; mk801 does not directly inhibit the binding
of [3h]glutamate to the nmda receptor (foster and
wong, 1987). it would thus seem probable
that
mk801 reduces the number of binding sites for
[3h]tcp, available for stimulation by glutamate. it
has been suggested that mk801 binds to the open
state of the ion channel associated with the nmda
receptor (kemp, foster and wong, 1987 for review).
the non-competitive
inhibition of the stimulation by
glutamate
of the binding of [3h]tcp by mk801
suggests that [‘h]tcp may also bind to a similar site.
this conclusion is strengthened
by the observation
that, in the presence of glutamate,
mk801 was a
competitive inhibitor of the binding of [3h]tcp (fig.
6b). electrophysiological
experiments
have demonstrated
that mk801
is a use-dependent,
noncompetitive inhibitor of responses to nmda (wang,
kemp, priestly,
knight,
woodruff
and iversen,
1986), a profile of action which is similar to that
observed previously with phencyclidine
and related
“dissociative
anaesthetics”
(martin
and lodge,
1985). taken together, these results strongly suggest
that [3h]tcp, like mk801, binds to the open state of
the ion channel of the nmda receptor complex.
electrophysiological
experiments
have indicated
that other modulatory
sites may be involved in the
function of nmda receptors. the studies of johnson
and ascher (1987) hav-e shown that glycine may
markedly potentiate responses to nmda in cultured
neurones. the effect of glycine in this system occurs
at small concentrations
and is insensitive to strychnine, which antagonises effects of glycine in the brain
stem and spinal cord. strychnine-insensitive
binding
sites for [‘hlglycine have been identified in mammalian forebrain (bristow, bowery and woodruff,
1986) and the distribution
of these binding sites
closely parallels the distribution
of nmda receptors
(bristow et al., 1986; cotman, monaghan,
ottersen
and storm-mathiesen,
1987). in the present study
glycine was found to stimulate
the binding
of
[3h]tcp in a strychnine-insensitive
manner. a similar

single experiment replicated twice.

addition, recent studies (loo, braunwalder, williams
and sills, 1987; fagg 1987; javitt, jotkowitz, sircar
and zukin, 1987) have demonstrated
that the binding
of [3h]tcp may be enhanced by several excitatory
amino acids with potencies similar to those at the
nmda
receptor
and that this enhancement
is
blocked by selective nmda receptor antagonists.
the studies of foster and wong (1987) and
reynolds, murphy and miller (1987) have suggested
that the novel anticonvulsant
mk801 may also bind
to the nmda receptor complex. in well washed
membranes the binding of [‘h]mk801 was enhanced
by the addition of glutamate and nmda and this
effect was blocked by aps. in agreement with the
observations
of foster and wong (1987), the maximum enhancement
of the binding of [3h]tcp was
observed after 4 washes, however in the present
experiments
the endogenous
concentrations

observation
has been recently reported
by others
(bonhaus,
burge and mcnamara,
1987; thomas,
hood, monaghan, contreras and o’donohue,
1988;
benavides,
rivy, carter and scatton,
1988) and
glycine has also been shown to enhance the binding
of [‘h]mk801 (wong, knight and ransom,
1987).
the effect of glycine was mimicked by other neutral
amino acids which also interact with strychnineinsensitive binding sites for [‘hlglycine (bristows et
al., 1986). thus,  xxxd5xxx  was considerably
more
potent than l-serine and l-alanine was of intermediate potency. the stimulation
of the binding of
[)h]tcp by glycine was inhibited by the nmda
receptor
antagonist
 xxxd1353xxx , as has been shown by
thomas et al. (1988) and benavides et al. (1988). the
antagonism by  xxxd1353xxx  was non-competitive
with respect
to glycine. it would seem unlikely that glycine and
related amino acids act directly at the binding site for
nmda, as  xxxd1353xxx  would be expected to be a competitive inhibitor of this effect. moreover glycine did
not inhibit the binding of [3h]glutamate in cortical
membranes
of the rat. two other interpretations
of
these data are possible. firstly, glycine may facilitate
the binding of glutamate to the nmda receptor and
secondly, that the interaction
of glycine with the
nmda receptor complex requires the presence of
glutamate binding to the nmda site. the first of
these possibilities suggests that the effects of glycine
are indirect
and mediated
through
an increased
affinity of the receptor for endogenous
glutamate in
the membrane
preparation.
when this was investigated, glycine was found to produce a small but
significant increase in the potency of glutamate to
enhance the binding of [3h]tcp. the unpublished
observations
of cotman et al. (cited in cotman et al.,
1987) also suggest that glycine may enhance the
binding of [3h]glutamate to the nmda receptor.
the interaction
between binding sites for glutamate
and glycine may well be reciproca! in that glutamate
was observed to increase the potency of glycine in
enhancing
the binding of [3h]tcp (fig. sb). the
potency of glycine in the present study was considerably less than the potency of glycine in electrophysiological
experiments
(johnson
and ascher,
1987) and in direct ligand binding
experiments
(bristow et al., 1986; wong et al., 1987). however, as
the potency of glycine may be dependent
upon the
concentration
of glutamate in the assay it is difficult
to estimate the true potency of glycine under these
different experimental
conditions.
saturation
analyses of the binding of [-‘h]tcp in
the presence of glutamate suggested that glutamate
increased
both the number
of binding
sites for
[3h]tcp and the affinity of the binding of [3h]tcp.
this contrasts with the situation with mk801, where
glutamate
increased the affinity of the binding of
without
increasing
the number
of
[3h]mk801
binding sites. in competition
experiments
(fig. 3),
glutamate enhanced the affinity of mk801 approximately 5-fold, in agreement with direct binding stud-

ies with [3h]mk801 (foster
and wong, 1987). in
contrast,
the affinity of phencyclidine
was not
significantly
altered by the addition of glutamate.
under basal conditions the number of binding sites
for [‘h]tcp was small, and it is impossible to exclude
the possibility that a low affinity site may also be
present, which is converted to one of higher affinity
in the presence of glutamate. this is emphasised by
the observation that glycine also produced significant
changes in the affinity of the binding of [3h]tcp,
however the number of binding sites observed in the
presence of glycine was not different to the number
of sites in the presence of glutamate.
in conclusion,
the present results suggest that
[‘h]tcp binds to the nmda receptor complex, to a
site associated with the ion channel and which may
be identical to the binding site for [?h]mk801. the
binding of [‘h]tcp to the receptor complex was
enhanced by the agonists glutamate and nmda and
was also modulated
by glycine, a putative allosteric
effector of the nmda
receptor.
ligand binding
studies with [‘h]tcp may be useful in the development of drugs acting at this receptor complex.
