summary:  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ), a proinflammatory cytokine, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). biotechnology agents including a chimeric monoclonal anti-tnf antibody (infliximab),
a humanized monoclonal anti-tnf antibody (cdp571), and a
recombinant tnf receptor fusion protein (etanercept) have
been used to inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  activity. controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for infliximab in moderately to severely active crohn’s disease (cd) and fistulizing cd sufficient to justify recent us. food and drug administration (fda) approval. additional trials have been completed in rheumatoid
arthritis (ra). similarly, preliminary controlled trials have suggested efficacy for cdp571 in active cd and ra. larger controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for etanercept in ra

patients who have failed disease modifying antirheumatic drug
(dmard) therapy leading to fda approval for ra. toxicities
observed with anti-tnf therapies have included formation of
human antichimeric antibodies (haca) with associated acute
and delayed hypersensitivity infusion reactions, human antihuman antibodies (hahas), and formation of autoantibodies
with rare instances of drug-induced lupus. several cases of
non-hodgkin’s lymphoma also has been described. future
studies should evaluate optimal timing and duration of antitnf therapy, the utility of adjuvant medical treatments during
anti-tnf therapy, and evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of
the various anti-tnf agents. key words: antitumor necrosis

introduction

man recombinant tnf receptor fusion protein), for patients with ibd and rheumatoid arthritis (ra).

current therapies for inflammatory bowel disease
(ibd) are limited by low-to-moderate efficacy, delayed
onset of action, frequent dosing regimens, and side effects. medications that inhibit  xxxg2296xxx -a
( xxxg2296xxx ) have been proposed as a new therapeutic class
with high efficacy, rapid onset of action, prolonged effect, and improved tolerance. this article reviews the use
of anti- xxxg2296xxx  agents including infliximab (a chimeric
monoclonal anti-tnf antibody), cdp57 1 (a humanized
monoclonal anti-tnf antibody), and etanercept (a hu-

 xxxg2296xxx  ligand, receptors, and
biologic effects
the gene encoding  xxxg2296xxx  is located on the short arm
of chromosome 6, between the hla class i and class i1
loci (1). transcription of this gene in monocytes, macrophages, and t cells results in the secretion of inactive
soluble 17 kd monomer proteins that subsequently combine to form 51 kd trimers, the active form of  xxxg2296xxx 
ligand (2,3). there are two different transmembrane receptors for  xxxg2296xxx  identified on most cell types: a 55 kd
protein ( xxxd924xxx ) and a 75 kd protein (p75) ( 4 3 . circulating
 xxxg2296xxx  trimers bind to two or three  xxxg2296xxx  receptors re-

sulting in cross-linking and signal transduction (6,7).
both the  xxxd924xxx  and p75 tnf receptors undergo enzymatic
cleavage by protein kinase c at the membrane surface
releasing soluble binding proteins that increase the activity of  xxxg2296xxx  at low concentrations (due to an increased
half-life of  xxxg2296xxx  from slow release of  xxxg2296xxx ) and inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  activity at higher concentrations (fig. 1) (810). after binding to its membrane bound receptors, the
proinflammatory cytokine  xxxg2296xxx  mediates multiple biologic effects including recruitment of neutrophils to local
sites of inflammation, induction of edema, activation of
coagulation, and induction of granuloma formation (fig.
2) (11,12).

role of  xxxg2296xxx  in ibd
 xxxg2296xxx  has been found in the serum (13-15), stool
(16,17), and intestinal tissue (18-21) of patients with
ibd. the specificity remains unclear and may be comparable to other forms of inflammation (14,15,20,21).
cells that express tnf can be found in the gut mucosa
and lamina propria of crohn's disease (cd) patients (2224). one study suggested enhanced secretion of  xxxg2296xxx 
and failure to release enhanced amounts of soluble tnf
receptors by lamina propria mononuclear cells (25).
 xxxg2296xxx  may be a cofactor for mucosal t helper cell type
1 (thl) response, and in a clinical study treatment with
the chimeric monoclonal anti- xxxg2296xxx  antibody infliximab
resulted in the down-regulation of mucosal thl cytokines (26). the clinical response of patients with cd to
chimeric or humanized monoclonal antibody therapy
with infliximab or cdp571 reinforces the potential pivotal role of  xxxg2296xxx  in the pathogenesis of cd (27,28).

tnf trimer

monoclonal antibodies and
fusion proteins

,

the development of monoclonal antibody therapies
has been reviewed elsewhere (29). antibodies serve as
adapters connecting antigens to effector molecules. antibody binding alone may provide sufficient neutralization although cell lysis via complement fixation or antibody-dependent cellular toxicity is another potential
mechanism to reduce cytokine production. attempts to
therapeutically administer murine monoclonal antibodies
(100% murine antibody) created using hybridoma technology resulted in significant human immune responses
due to the formation of human antimouse antibodies
(hamas) directed against the constant region of the
mouse antibody (30,3 1). with repeat treatment, formation of hamas caused both a shortening of the half-life
for the murine monoclonal antibody (due to increased
clearance of the antibody from the serum) and hypersensitivity reactions (29-3 1).
protein engineering techniques that transplant antigen
binding sites from murine to human antibodies have been
used to decrease amounts of murine protein in therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, thus reducing immunogenicity. the first generation of engineered monoclonal antibodies were simple chimeric monoclonal antibodies in
which the variable domains of a mouse monoclonal antibody were transplanted to the constant domains of human antibodies (fig. 3). the resulting chimeric monoclonal antibody is approximately 75% human and 25%
murine (fig. 4). while chimeric monoclonal antibodies
are less immunogenic than murine monoclonal antibodies, they still result in the formation of human antichimeric antibodies (hacas) (32) directed against the

is monocyte/macrophages. tnf induces a number of proinflammatory changes in endothelial cells, including cytokine production,
expression of adhesion molecules, release of procoagulatory substances, and induction of inos. these alterations may lead to septic
shock. furthermore, tnf stimulates b and t cells, induces fever in the brain, suppressesthe  xxxg1337xxx  in adipocytes (contributing

transplanted variable domain from the mouse. however,
these chimeric monoclonal antibodies appear to have
better pharmacokinetics than murine monoclonal antibodies, with half-lives significantly extended in humans
(29,33).
the second generation of engineered monoclonal antibodies were “humanized” by transplanting the antigen
binding region (complimentarity determining regions or
cdr) of murine variable domains to human antibodies.
the resulting humanized monoclonal antibody is approximately 95% human and 5% murine (fig. 4). while
expected to be less immunogenic than chimeric monoclonal antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies do
result in formation of human antihuman antibodies
(hahas) directed against both the variable regions
(mouse and human) and the allotype (human) antibody
structures (29,34,35). similar to chimeric monoclonal
antibodies, these humanized monoclonal antibodies appear to have better pharmacokinetics than murine monoclonal antibodies, with significantly prolonged half-lives
in humans (29,33).
the third generation of engineered antibodies are
more properly termed “fusion proteins.” fusion proteins
are created by linking dna encoding a human protein
receptor to dna encoding the fc portion of a human

100% human, immunoglobulin-like dimer (fig. 4). even
these completely human recombinant proteins have some
immunogenicity and can result in the formation of
hahas. the fusion of the fc portion of an antibody to
soluble protein receptors significantly prolongs the halflives of soluble receptors.
selection of different constant domains has implications for the effector function of chimeric and humanized
monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins. for example,
the iggl isotype results in complement fixation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity whereas the igg4 isotype
has more favorable blocking characteristics.

anti- xxxg2296xxx  agents and mechanisms
of action
infliximab
infliximab (previously ca2) is a chimeric monoclonal
antibody to human  xxxg2296xxx  constructed by linking the
variable regions of a mouse antihuman tnf monoclonal

inflainmatort). bowel di,waes@,v d . s, nu 2. muy 19%

antibody (a2) to human iggl with k light chains (36). it
is produced commercially by centocor (malvern, pa,
u.s.a.) and marketed as remicade. infliximab has a
strong binding affinity to soluble trimers of  xxxg2296xxx  (kd
100 pm) (34,37). similarly, infliximab has a strong binding affinity to the transmembrane form of  xxxg2296xxx  (kd 46
pm) (38). in vitro, infliximab binding to transmembrane
 xxxg2296xxx  results in complement fixation and antibodydependent cytotoxicity in a tumor cell line, whereas an
investigational igg4 form of infliximab showed no cellkilling activity (38). some or all of these effects may
play a role in the in vivo activity of infliximab (fig. 5)
(39). infliximab does not promote the rapid removal of
tnf, instead it paradoxically prolongs the half-life of
 xxxg2296xxx  (40). thus infliximab acts both as a cytokine “carrier” and as a tnf antagonist, with the net effect of
rendering tnf biologically inactive (40). in vivo studies
with infliximab have demonstrated down regulation of
mucosal thl cytokines (26), decreased activation of coagulation (41), decreased circulating secretory phospholipase a, (42), decreased concentrations of il-1, il-6,
soluble  xxxg2048xxx , and icam-1 (43,44), and a decrease
in serum  xxxg1418xxx  and  xxxg1437xxx  (45).

fig. 5. mechanisms for antibody neutralization of  xxxg2296xxx . lnfliximab (chimeric anti- xxxg2296xxx  antibody) works by binding to and neutralizing
transmembrane  xxxg2296xxx  on macrophage or activated t-cell surfaces, binding to and neutralizing free tnf-cu in the serum, and lysis of
 xxxg2296xxx  producing cells via complement fixation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc). cdp571 (humanized anti-tnf-cu
antibody) works by binding to and neutralizing free tnf-cu in the serum. etanercept (human recombinant fusion protein with two soluble
p75 tnf receptors per fc molecule) works by binding to and neutralizing free  xxxg2296xxx  in the serum. [modified and reproduced with
permission from: kam l, targan s. lnfliximab and crohn’s disease. clin persp gastroentero/1998;1:67-72.]

cdp571
a humanized monoclonal antibody to human  xxxg2296xxx 
initially named cdp57 1 (celltech, slough, england,
u.k.) was constructed by transplanting the complimentarity determining regions or cdr of a mouse antihuman
tnf monoclonal antibody to human igg4 with k light
chains (46). cdp571 has a strong binding affinity to
soluble trimers of  xxxg2296xxx  (kd 100 pm) (29) and is believed to bind to the transmembrane form of  xxxg2296xxx .
cdp57 1 and other investigational versions of humanized
igg4 anti- xxxg2296xxx  antibodies neither fix complement nor
mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (47). thus, the
in vivo effect of cdp571 is believed to result from the
binding of soluble trimers of  xxxg2296xxx  and membranebound  xxxg2296xxx  (fig. 5 ) (47). the only in vivo mechanistic
study, to date, demonstrated a decrease in the concentration of il-1 after treatment with cdp571 (48).

etanercept
etanercept (enbrel, immunex, seattle, wa, u.s.a.), a
human fusion protein initially named tnfr:fc, was con-

structed by linking the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human  xxxg2301xxx  to the fc portion of
iggl (49). the fc component contains the c,2 domain,
the c,3 domain, and the hinge region but not the ch1
domain of iggl. the fusion protein is produced by recombinant dna technology in a chinese hamster ovary
system. the resulting fusion protein is an immunoglobulin-like dimer consisting of two soluble p75 tnf receptors per fc molecule.
etanercept binds soluble trimers of  xxxg2296xxx  with the
same high affinity as membrane-bound p75 tnf receptors but with a higher affinity than binding of soluble
tnf trimers by soluble  xxxg2301xxx  monomers
(49). the serum half-life of etanercept is significantly
longer than the soluble  xxxg2301xxx  monomer (50).
in vivo, etanercept competitively inhibits binding of
soluble  xxxg2296xxx  trimers to membrane bound  xxxg2296xxx  receptors (fig. 5) (49,51). similar to infliximab, etanercept
does not promote the rapid removal of tnf but paradoxically prolongs the half-life of  xxxg2296xxx  by acting as a
cytokine “carrier” and as a tnf antagonist, with the net
effect of rendering tnf biologically inactive (51). in

vitro, etanercept binding to transmembrane  xxxg2296xxx  does
not result in complement fixation or antibody-dependent
cytotoxicity (5 1). mechanistic studies have demonstrated
decreased concentrations of il- 1, il-6, soluble eselectin, icam- l , and  xxxg1437xxx 
(5 1,53) after treatment with etanercept.

pharmacokinetics
infliximab
data from a study of single intravenous infusions of 1,

5, 10, or 20 mgkg of infliximab showed a direct and
linear relationship between the dose administered and the
maximum serum concentration (cmax)and the area under
the concentration-time curve (table 1) (40,54). the median serum concentrations versus time profiles for a
single i.v. infusion of 5, 10, or 20 mgkg of infliximab
are shown in fig. 6a (40). the volume of distribution at
steady state (vj, clearance, and mean residence time are
independent of the administered dose (table 1) (40,54).
infliximab is predominantly distributed in the vascular
compartment and has a prolonged half-life (table 1)
(40,54). following a single dose, the serum levels declined in an exponential fashion through 8-12 weeks
(fig. 6a). the median serum concentration of the 5 mg/
kg treatment group was undetectable by 12 weeks following the infusion. no evidence of accumulation was
observed after repeated dosing with infliximab 5 mgkg
at weeks 0, 2, and 6, or in after repeated dosing with 4
infusions of infliximab 10 mgkg at 8-week intervals
(54).

cdp571
data from a study of single intravenous infusions of
0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mgkg of cdp571 showed a
direct and linear relationship between administered dose,
maximum serum concentration (c,,,) and the area under
the concentration-time curve (table 1) (46). the mean
serum concentrations versus time profiles for single i.v.
infusions of 0.1,0.3, 1, 2, 5, or 10 mgkg of cdp571 are
shown in fig. 6b (46). cdp571 has a prolonged half-life
and is predominantly distributed in the vascular compartment (table 1) (46). following a single dose, the serum
levels declined in an exponential fashion through 3-12
weeks (fig. 1). cdp571 was detectable in the serum 12
weeks after a single infusion in 7 of 12 of the subjects
who received doses of 2, 5, or 10 mgkg (46).

etanercept
data from single subcutaneous injections of 25 mg of
etanercept in 3 patients with ra showed a median halflife of 115 hours (range 98-300 hours) with a clearance
of 89 &/hour (52 ml/hr/m2) (51). a maximum serum
concentration (c,,,) of 1.2 mcg/& (range 0.6-1.5 mcg/
ml) and a time to c,,, of 72 hours (range 48-96 hours)
was observed in these patients (51). after continued dosing in ra patients, (n = 25) for 6 months with 25 mg
twice weekly, the median observed level was 3.0 mcg!
ml (range 1.7-5.6 mcg/ml) (5 1). based on the available
data, individual patients may undergo two- to fivefold
increase in serum levels with repeated dosing.

results in crohn’s disease
infliximab
the clinical studies of infliximab therapy for cd are
summarized in table 2. infliximab was first used as a
therapy for cd in a 14-year-old female with medically
refractory symptoms treated with infliximab 10 mgkg at
weeks 0 and 2. the patient experienced clinical and endoscopic remission lasting 3 months (55). this initial
case report was followed by a pilot study in 10 patients
with medically refractory cd. eight patients received
treatment with a single infusion of infliximab 10 mgkg
and 2 patients received a single infusion of infliximab 20
mgkg. all 10 patients experienced clinical and endoscopic improvement, and 9 of i0 patients experienced
clinical remission lasting 8 weeks (56). clinical improvement was accompanied by impressive endoscopic and
histologic healing.

the first dose-response study then enrolled 20 patients
with medically refractory cd randomized to therapy
with a single dose of infliximab 1 mgkg, 5 mgkg, 10
mgkg, or 20 mgkg (57). at 4 weeks, clinical improvement [defined as a decrease of at least 70 points in the
crohn’s disease activity index (cdai) score compared
with the baseline value] occurred in 2 of 5 patients (40%)
receiving the 1 mgkg dose, 4 of 5 (80%)at 5 mgkg, 4
of 5 (80%)  xxxd1891xxx  mgkg, and 4 of 5 (80%) at 20 mgkg
(table 2). at 12 weeks, clinical improvement persisted
in 1 of 5 patients (20%) receiving the 1 mgkg dose, 2 of
3 (67%) at 5 mgkg, 4 of 5 (80%)  xxxd1891xxx  mgkg, and 2 of
4 (50%) at 20 mgkg. these resuits were used to determine the infliximab doses of 5 mgkg, 10 mgkg, and 20
mgkg for the phase iibphase i11 placebo-controlled
clinical trials.
the subsequent (phase iib/iii) trial was designed as a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-ranging study of infliximab enrolling 108

or closure of 100% of crohn’s disease fistulae or metastatic perineal wounds.

patients with moderately to severely active cd refractory
to medical therapy (27). patients initially received placebo, 5 mgkg, 10 mgkg, or 20 mgkg of infliximab. at
4 weeks, clinical improvement occurred in 4 of 24 (17%)
of the placebo group, 22 of 27 (82%) at 5 mg/kg, 14 of
28 (50%)  xxxd1891xxx  mgkg, and 18 of 28 (64%) at 20 mgkg,
p < 0.001 (table 2). clinical remission (defined as a
cdai score < 150 points) at 4 weeks occurred in 1 of 24
(4%) of the placebo group, 13 of 27 (48%) at 5 mg/kg, 7
of 28 (25%)  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg, and 7 of 28 (25%) at 20 mgkg,
p = 0.005 (table 2). these results confirmed that a
single infusion of infliximab was effective for moderately to severely active cd refractory to medical therapy,
and that 5 mgkg was the best dose for both improvement
and induction of clinical remission.
a second phase iibliii study of infliximab was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter, dose-ranging trial enrolling 94
patients with cd complicated by draining enterocutaneous fistulae involving the abdominal wall or perianal
region (58). patients were treated with three infusions of
placebo or infliximab 5 mgkg or 10 mgkg at weeks 0,
2, and 6, and followed for 18 weeks. improvement was
defined as closure (in spite of gentle compression) of
250% of draining fistulae maintained for at least 4
weeks. remission was defined as closure of all draining
fistulae, maintained for at least 4 weeks. improvement
occurred in 8 of 3 1 (26%) of the placebo group, 21 of 3 1

(67%) at 5 mgkg dose, and 18 of 32 (56%)  xxxd1891xxx  mgkg
dose, p = 0.002 (table 2). remission of draining fistulae occurred in 4 of 31 (13%) of the placebo group, 17 of
31 (55%) after 5 mgkg dosing, and 12 of 32 (38%) after
10 mgkg dosing, p = 0.001 (table 2). these results
demonstrated that infliximab also was effective for cd
complicated by draining enterocutaneous fistulae and
supported 5 mg/kg as the optimal dose. of interest, a
small case series recently reported that infliximab may
be useful in closing nonhealed perineal wounds in cd
after proctocolectomy (59).
a preliminary maintenance of remission study was
also conducted as a follow-up to the phase iib/iii study
for chronically active cd. this study was randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multi-center, enrolling 73 patients with cd in whom infliximab had been
used to induce improvement or remission (60). patients
who responded to the initial dose of infliximab or placebo, or responded to a second, open label infusion of 10
mgkg were rerandomized after 12 weeks to treatment
with placebo or infliximab 10 mgkg at weeks 12,20,28,
and 36, and followed through 48 weeks. at 44 weeks (8
weeks after the final infliximab dose), clinical improvement was maintained in 13 of 37 (35%) of the placebo
group and 24 of 36 (66%) of the 10 mgkg dosing group,
p < 0.01 (table 2). clinical remission was maintained in
8 of 37 (21%) of the placebo group and 18 of 36 (5 1 %)
in the 10 mgkg dosing group, p < 0.05 (table 2). how-

anti-tnf for ibd
ever, because the confidence intervals were wide and the
life-table analyses were not statistically significant, the
results were not definitive. nevertheless, the study suggests that infliximab may be effective for maintaining
remission for patients who respond to an initial infusion.
the optimal dose and dosing interval for infliximab
maintenance of remission therapy remains to be determined. in addition, most patients were receiving concomitant therapy with aminosalicylates, steroids, or  xxxd371xxx . preliminary analyses suggested that
concurrent immunomodulating therapy may enhance the
maintenance response (schaible t., personal communication). these outcomes would be consistent with the
concurrent use of  xxxd371xxx  for rheumatoid arthritis (see below). the failure to achieve statistical significance due to wide confidence intervals and questions
regarding concomitant medications led the fda to withhold a maintenance claim for infliximab.

cdp571
a small, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-center phase iia trial with cdp571 for
cd has been reported. the trial was comprised of 30
patients with mildly to severely active cd refractory to
medical therapy (28). patients were treated with a single
dose of placebo or cdp571 5 mgkg and followed for 8
weeks. the primary endpoint for the study was a decrease in the median cdai score at 2 weeks. after receiving cdp57 1, the median cdai score decreased significantly from 263 points at baseline to 167 points at
week 2, p = 0.0003; in contrast, there was no significant
decrease in the median cdai score of the placebotreated group (253 points at baseline to 247 points) at
week 2. after 2 weeks clinical remission occurred in 0 of
10 (0%) patients in the placebo group and 6 of 20 (30%)
in the cdp571 5 mgkg group, p value not significant
(table 2). of the six cdp571-treated patients who were
in remission at week 2, four patients had a persistent
remission for 6 weeks and three patients for 8 weeks.
these results suggested that cdp571 5 mgkg may have
short-term efficacy in mildly to severely active cd refractory to medical therapy. the optimal dose and dosing
interval for cdp57 1 therapy for improvement, induction
of remission, and maintenance for patients with cd remain to be determined. phase iib/iii trials for patients
with cd refractory to medical therapy and for steroiddependent patients are currently underway.

etanercept
there are no published clinical trials of etanercept for
the treatment of cd.

results in rheumatoid arthritis
infliximab
infliximab was first used in a 20-patient pilot study for
active ra that had not responded to previous therapy
with various dmards (61). ten patients received two
infusions of infliximab 10 mgkg on days 0 and 14, and
10 patients received 4 infusions of infliximab 5 mgkg on
days 0, 4, 8, and 12. all 20 patients experienced a response as determined by the paulus 20% response criteria. eight of these patients were entered into an open
label retreatment protocol consisting of 1-3 infusions of
infliximab 10 mgkg administered for relapse (defined as
the loss of previous response to infliximab) (62). seven
of eight patients experienced repeated responses after
1-3 retreatment cycles, with maintenance of the response.
this initial study was followed by a 73-patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center,
dose-ranging trial for active ra that had not responded
to previous therapy with at least one dmard (63). patients were randomized to a single infusion of placebo,
infliximab 1 mgkg, or infliximab 10 mgkg. clinical
improvement, as determined by a paulus 20% response
criteria, occurred in 2 of 24 (8%) of the placebo group,
11 of 25 (44%) of the 1 mgkg infliximab group, and 19
of 24 (79%) of the 10 mgkg infliximab group at 4
weeks, p < 0.0001. a more stringent criteria for improvement (a paulus 50% response) occurred in 2 of 24 (8%)
of the placebo group, 7 of 25 (28%) of the 1 mgkg
infliximab group, and 14 of 24 (58%) of the 10 mgkg
infliximab group, p = 0.0005. these results demonstrated the efficacy of a single infusion of infliximab for
active ra unresponsive to previous dmard therapy,
and that the 10 mgkg was more effective than 1 mgkg.
the next infliximab study enrolled 28 patient with
active ra unresponsive to 3 months of methotrexate into
a phase iia randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-center, dose-ranging trial (64). patients
were randomized to a single infusion of placebo, or infliximab 5 mgkg, 10 mgkg, or 20 mgkg (64). all patients continued methotrexate 10 mglweek throughout
the trial. during the course of the 12-week trial, clinical
improvement, as determined by the american college of
rheumatology (acr) response criteria, occurred in i of
7 (14%) of the placebo group compared with a pooled
response of 17 of 21 (81%) for the three infliximab
groups. the clinical response to infliximab tended to be
more durable for patients receiving the 10 mgkg and 20
mgkg doses. eleven of these patients were entered into
an open label retreatment protocol consisting of 3 infu-

sions of infliximab 10 mgkg administered at weeks 12,
20, and 28 (65). nine of 11 patients experienced a prolonged response during the infliximab retreatment study.
these results demonstrated that infliximab at doses of 5
mgkg, 10 mgkg, and 20 mg/kg was effective for active
ra unresponsive to concurrent dmard therapy with
methotrexate and suggested that repeated dosing may be
beneficial.
the first phase iib/iii trial of infliximab in ra was a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-ranging trial that enrolled 101 patients who
were unresponsive to dmard therapy with methotrexate (66). patients were followed for 26 weeks during
treatment with placebo plus methotrexate 7.5 mglweek;
infliximab 1 mgkg, 3 mgkg, or 10 mgkg plus methotrexate 7.5 mg/week; or infliximab 1 mgkg, 3 mgkg, or
10 mgkg without methotrexate at weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, and
14. improvement was defined by paulus 20% response
criteria. a durable paulus 20% response occurred in 60%
of patients treated with infliximab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg,
with or without methotrexate. patients treated with infliximab 1 mgkg without methotrexate rapidly became
unresponsive to repeated infliximab infusions, whereas
patients treated with infliximab 1 mgkg plus methotrexate had a durable paulus 20% response rate of 60%.
these results demonstrated that repeated administration
of infliximab at doses of 3 mgkg and 10 mgkg, with or
without low dose methotrexate, was effective for inducing and maintaining a clinical response in active ra
patients who were previously unresponsive to methotrexate. efficacy of infliximab 1 mgkg required concomitant
methotrexate therapy.
the second, and largest, phase i11 infliximab study
enrolled 428 patients with active ra unresponsive to
methotrexate into a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-center, dose-ranging, multiple-dosing
trial of infliximab (67). patients were treated with placebo, infliximab 3 mgkg every 4 weeks, infliximab 3
mgkg every 8 weeks, infliximab 10 mgkg every 4
weeks, or infliximab 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks for a total
of 30 weeks. all patients continued methotrexate at a
dose 212.5 mg/week throughout the study. improvement was defined by acr 20 response criteria. during
the course of the 30-week trial, clinical improvement
occurred in 18 of 88 (20%) of the placebo group cornpared with 43 of 86 (50%) in the 3 mgkg every 4 weeks
group, 43 of 86 (50%) in the 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks
group, 47 of 81 (58%) in the 10 mglkg every 4 weeks
group, and 4.5 of 87 (52%) in the 10 mgkg every 8 weeks
group, p < 0.001. these results demonstrated that repeated administration of infliximab was effective for inducing and then maintaining a clinical response in active

ra unresponsive to dmard therapy with methotrexate,
and that infliximab 3 mgkg administered every 8 weeks,
in combination with methotrexate, was the optimal therapeutic strategy.

cdp571
cdp571 was first used as a therapy for ra in a 36patient phase iia study for active ra that had not responded to previous therapy with various slow acting
antirheumatic drugs (72). patients were randomized to
receive a single infusion of placebo or cdp571 0.1 mg/
kg, 1 mgkg, or 10 mgkg and were followed for 8 weeks.
in patients receiving cdp57 1, there was a dose-related
fall in the pain scale at week 1. the decrease in the pain
scale for the cdp571 10 mgkg group reached a maximum decrease of 40% at 2 weeks with continued evidence of improvement at 8 weeks. thirty of these patients then entered an open label retreatment protocol
consisting of a single dose of cdp571 1 mgkg or 10
mgkg and followed for an additional 8 weeks. there
were trends toward improvement at weeks 1-4 with a
return to preinfusion values at week 8. the best outcomes were with placebo followed by open cdp571 10
mgkg or blinded cdp571 10 mgkg followed by open
cdp571 10 mgkg. this study provides preliminary evidence that cdp57 l is efficacious for active ra and suggests a dose response, with the highest cdp571 dose
studied to date being 10 mg/kg.

etanercept
etanercept was first used as a therapy for ra in a
phase i study enrolling 16 patients who had not responded to previous therapy with various dmards
(68). patients were randomized to receive placebo or
etanercept 4 mg/m2, 8 mg/m2, 16 mg/m2, or 32 mg/m2 as
an intravenous loading dose, followed by subcutaneous
injections of placebo or etanercept 2 mg/m2, 4 mg/m2, 8
mg/m2, or 16 mg/m2 twice weekly for 4 weeks. clinical
improvement, as determined by improvement in total
pain and total joint scores, occurred in 22% of placebotreated patients and 4.5% of etanercept-treated patients.
there was no clear evidence of a dose response.
this phase i study was followed by a phase i1 study of
180 patients with active ra who had not responded to
previous therapy with various dmards (69). patients
were randomized to receive a twice-weekly course of
subcutaneous injections of placebo or etanercept 0.25
mg/m2, 2 mg/m2, or 16 mg/m2. clinical improvement as
determined by acr 20 response criteria at 12 weeks
occurred in 14% of the placebo group, 33% of the etaner-

129

anti-tnf for ibd
cept 0.25 mg/m2 group, 46% of the etanercept 2 mg/m2
group, and 75% of the etanercept 16 mg/m2 group. these
results demonstrated that etanercept at twice-weekly
doses of 0.25 mg/m2, 2 mg/m2, and 16 mg/m2 was effective for up to 12 weeks in patients with active ra who
had not responded to previous therapy with various
dmards, and that 16 mg/m2 was the most effective
etanercept dose.
a larger, 234-patient phase i11 randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, dose-ranging,
multiple-dosing trial of etanercept was held for active
ra patients who had not responded to previous therapy
with various dmards (70). patients were treated with
placebo, etanercept 10 mg, or etanercept 25 mg (equivalent to 16 mg/m2) twice weekly as a subcutaneous injection for 6 months. improvement was defined by acr 20
response criteria. during the course of the 6-month trial,
clinical improvement occurred in 23% of the placebo
group, 46% of the etanercept 10 mg group, and 62% of
the etanercept 25 mg group. these results demonstrated
that etanercept at twice-weekly doses of 10 mg and 25
mg was effective for up to 6 months in patients with
active ra who had not responded to previous therapy
with various dmards, and that the 25-mg etanercept
dose was most effective.
the second phase i11 trial was a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, multiple-dosing
trial of etanercept enrolling 89 patients with active ra
unresponsive to dmard therapy with methotrexate
(71). patients were treated with placebo or etanercept 25
mg (equivalent to 16 mg/m2) twice weekly as a subcutaneous injection for 6 months. all patients continued
methotrexate throughout the study. improvement was defined by acr 20 response criteria. during the course of
the 6-month trial, clinical improvement occurred in 27%
of the placebo group and 71% of the etanercept group.
these results demonstrated that etanercept at a twiceweekly dose of 25 mg was more effective than placebo
for up to 6 months in active ra patients who were unresponsive to dmard therapy with methotrexate.

results in ulcerative colitis
infliximab
a preliminary phase iia trial with infliximab for ulcerative colitis (uc) had been reported. the study enrolled 11 hospitalized patients with severely active, steroid-refractory uc treated in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial (73). patients
were treated with a single dose of placebo or infliximab
5 mgkg, 10 mgkg, or 20 mg/kg and followed for 2

weeks. the primary endpoint for the study was clinical
response as defined by a decrease in the baseline modified truelove and witt's score of 2 5 points and an absolute score c 10 points. at 2 weeks a clinical response
was observed in 0 of 3 patients in the placebo group, 2 of
3 patients in the infliximab 5 mgkg group, 1 of 3 patients
in the infliximab 10 mgkg group, and 2 of 2 patients in
the infliximab 20 mgkg group. these findings provide
preliminary evidence that infliximab may be of benefit in
severe uc, but additional studies are needed to prove
efficacy and to determine optimal dose and dosing intervals.

cdp571
a phase i, open-label trial with cdp571 for uc has
been reported from a single center (74). fifteen patients
with mildly to moderately active uc, some of whom
were refractory to medical therapy, were treated with a
single dose of cdps71 5 mgkg and followed for 8
weeks. the primary endpoint was a decrease in the mean
powell tuck score over the course of the study. the
mean powell tuck score decreased significantly from 6.7
to 4.6 points at week 1, and there was a trend towards a
decreased score at week 2 but not at weeks 4 or 8. these
results suggest a possible short-term benefit from
cdp57 1, 5 mgkg (up to 2 weeks) in mildly to moderately active uc. additional studies are needed to prove
efficacy and to determine the optimal dose and dosing
interval. of interest, cdps71 has also shown benefit in
the cotton-top tamarin animal model of uc (75).

etanercept
there are no published clinical trials of etanercept for
the treatment of uc.

toxicity of anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapy
immunogenicity (formation of haca or haha)
one hundred thirty-four of 199 cd patients treated
with infliximab were evaluated for the presence of antibodies to infliximab (hacas), of whom 18 (13%) were
positive (54). haca-positive patients were more likely
to experience infusion reactions. concomitant immune
modifier therapy with corticosteroids, azathioprine, or
 xxxd2573xxx  during infliximab therapy for cd appeared to protect- against haca formation (10% frequency) compared with patients not taking immune
modifier therapy (23% frequency) (54). similarly, lowdose methotrexate (7.5 mg/week) during infliximab

inflammatory bowel diseases", val. 5, no. 2, may 1999

therapy for ra protected against haca formation (66).
of note, higher doses of infliximab (25 mgkg) may be
associated with less haca formation than lower doses
of 1 mgkg or 3 mgkg (66). the presence of haca may
be associated with an increased clearance and shortened
serum half-life of infliximab (62). at present there is no
commercially available assay for haca.
sixteen percent of patients treated with etanercept for
ra developed antibodies to etanercept (hahas) that did
not correlate with clinical response or adverse events
( 5 1). the likelihood of developing antibodies to cdp571
(hahas) in healthy volunteers treated with cdp57 1
was inversely proportional to the dose, with minimal
haha formation at the 10 mgkg dose (46). seven of 20
(35%) patients with cd treated with cdp57 i developed
a haha response (28). the clinical significance of
haha antibodies after cdp571 is unknown.

autoantibodies
eighty-five of 357 (24%) of infliximab-treated patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ana) were
positive at baseline compared with 128 of 357 (36%) at
the last evaluation (54).
antidouble stranded dna (anti-dsdna) developed in
approximately 9% of patients treated with infliximab.
baseline therapy with immune modifier therapy in cd
was associated with a decreased likelihood of developing
anti-dsdna (3% versus 21%) (54). two patients treated
with infliximab developed clinical symptoms consistent
with a lupus-like syndrome requiring discontinuation of
infliximab and treatment with corticosteroids. antidsdna disappeared when infliximab therapy was discontinued.
whether patients treated with cdp571 have an increased frequency of new autoantibody formation is unknown.
patients treated with etanercept do have an increased
frequency of developing new autoantibodies compared
with placebo-treated patients: ana, 11% versus 5%;
anti-dsdna, 15% versus 4% (51).

infusion-related reactions
among 1,207 infliximab infusion reactions (defined as
any adverse event occurring during or for 2 hours after an
infusion), 58 of 1,207 (5%) were accompanied by nonbpecific symptoms such as fever or chills. one percent
were accompanied by pruritus or urticaria, 1% by cardiopulmonary reactions (primarily chest pain, hypotension, hypertension, or dyspnea), and 0.2% by combined
symptoms of pruritushrticaria and cardiopulmonary re-

lnflurnrnutory bowel diseuserm, vol. 5, no. 2, may i y y y

actions (54). infusion reactions were more likely during
a second infusion. patients who became positive for
haca were more likely to develop infusion reactions
(36% versus 1 i%), and concomitant therapy with immune modifier therapy appeared to reduce the frequency
of infusion reactions.
recently, the manufacturer of infliximab (centocor)
reported that 10 of 40 (25%) patients with cd treated
2-4 years previously with infliximab developed a serum
sickness-like, delayed-hypersensitivity reaction 3-12
days after retreatment. signs and symptoms included
myalgia, rash, fever, polyarthralgia, pruritus, facial or lip
edema, dysphagia, and urticaria. six of the 10 patients
were hospitalized and were treated with high-dose steroids. these patients had been negative for haca at the
time of retreatment but, at the time of the reaction, had
developed titers as high as 1:40,000 and were found to
have no circulating infliximab, suggesting a rapid anemnestic response with antigen-antibody complex formation.
the frequency, types, and severity of infusion reactions after treatment with cdp571 is unknown, although
in studies reported to date this issue does not appear to be
a significant problem (28,46,72,74).
thirty-seven percent of patients treated with etanercept developed reactions at injection sites (51). all injection site reactions were described as mild to moderate
(erythema, and/or itching, pain, or swelling) and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation.

lymphoproliferative disorders
of 394 patients treated with infliximab who were followed from 6 months to 3 years after receiving their last
infusion, one case of non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl)
was identified in a cd patient, two cases of nhl were
observed in patients with ra, and one case of nhl
occurred in a patient with hiv and aids (54). in addition, one case of myeloma occurred in a patient with ra.
subsequently one additional case of nhl occurred in an
infliximab-treated ra patient participating in a multipledosing study in which 340 patients received infliximab
(67). given the confounding associations between nhi,
and both ra (76) and aids (77), the available data are
not sufficient to determine whether there is an increased
risk of nhl after exposure to infliximab. an association
between nhl and cd is less clear cut, with one study
reporting a series of nine cases (78) but three populationbased studies reporting no evidence for a statistically
increased risk (79-81).
to date, with only 166 patients or healthy volunteers
reported treated with single or multiple doses of

anti-tnf for ibd

cdp57 1, no lymphoproliferative disorders have occurred.
among 745 ra patients treated in clinical trials with
etanercept for up to 18 months, one case of hodgkin’s
disease and no cases of nhl occurred.
it is unclear whether nhl occurring after infliximab
for cd and ra, as compared with etanercept and
cdp571, is a true increased risk or simply represents
imprecise confidence intervals.

infections and abscesses
there is no evidence of an increased frequency of
serious infections associated with infliximab, etanercept,
or cdp57 1 compared with placebo-treated patients (27,
46,51,54,72,74). there was a 12% frequency of new abscess formation among patients with fistulizing cd
treated with infliximab, possibly due to uneven healing
of fistula tracts, with closure of the cutaneous opening
before healing of the mucosal orifice.

conclusions
biotechnology agents including infliximab, cdp57 1,
and etanercept have been used to inhibit  xxxg2296xxx  activity.
controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for infliximab in moderately to severely active cd and fistulizing
cd with sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy for
recent fda approval. regulatory assessment of infliximab for ra is pending. similarly, the fda has accepted
the demonstrated efficacy and safety for etanercept in
ra patients who have failed disease dmard therapy.
preliminary controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy
for cdp571 in active cd and ra. toxicities observed
with biologic anti-tnf therapies have included formation of hacas and hahas, leading in some instances
to minor and severe infusion reactions, and formation of
autoantibodies leading in some instances to drug-induced
lupus. the true risk of nhl remains to be determined
after larger populations are studied over longer periods
of time. future studies should evaluate the optimal timing and duration of anti-tnf therapy, the utility of continuing other medical treatments during anti-tnf
therapy, and should compare the safety and efficacy of
the biologic and soon to be evaluated standard pharmacologic approaches to inhibit tnf such as thalidomide.
