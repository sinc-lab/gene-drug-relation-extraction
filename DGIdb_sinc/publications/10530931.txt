abstractða series of 2-carbonyl analogues of the muscarinic antagonist  xxxd1907xxx  bearing 1-substituents of dierent lipophilic,
electronic, and steric properties was synthesized and their anity for the m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes was evaluated by
functional tests. two derivatives (2g and 2d) showed an m2-selective pro®le which was con®rmed by functional tests on the m1 and
m4 receptors. a possible relationship between m2 selectivity and lipophilicity of the 1-substituent was suggested by structure±
activity analysis. this work showed that appropriate structural modi®cation of  xxxd1907xxx  can lead to m2-selective muscarinic
antagonists of possible interest in the ®eld of alzheimer's disease. # 1999 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

introduction
the heterogeneity among muscarinic receptor has been
widely demonstrated, and ®ve unique gene sequences
coding for muscarinic receptors (m1±m5) have been
cloned;1 four of them (m1±m4) have been pharmacologically de®ned.2 the search for potent and selective
ligands is still in progress, mostly because of the need
for reliable pharmacological standards which would
make for a more complete classi®cation and represent
potential therapeutic agents. in fact, muscarinic receptor subtypes are variously involved in secretory and
cardiovascular functions, smooth muscle control and in
central nervous system transmission.
as a part of our studies on  xxxd1907xxx  (1,1-diphenyl-4piperidin-1-yl-butan-1-ol, 1), we initially turned our
attention to the part of the molecule interacting with the
hydrophobic receptor pocket introducing a substituent
in either position para or meta or ortho to one phenyl
ring of the lead compound.3 to extend our research, we
then modi®ed the intermediate chain connecting the
lipophilic head of the molecule to the cationic center
rendering it more polar or less ¯exible.4 the introduction

of a carbonyl group in position 2 of the butyl chain of
 xxxd1907xxx  led to compound 2 with enhanced anity for
both the m2 and the  xxxg449xxx  subtypes and a selectivity ratio m3/m2 better than that of  xxxd1907xxx  (1,
table 1).

considering the important role of the benzilic oh in
position 1 of  xxxd1907xxx  (1), we designed and synthesized a number of 1-substituted-2-carbonyl derivatives
(2a±i, table 1) with the aim to evaluate the contribution
of 1-substituents to the anity for the muscarinic
receptor subtypes. substituents were chosen in such a
way as to provide orthogonality and as much variability
as possible with respect to the classical lipophilic (p),
electronic (s) and steric (mr) parameters.
in this paper, we report the synthesis and the evaluation
by functional studies of the anity and selectivity for
muscarinic receptor subtypes of the title compounds,
and discuss their structure±activity and structure±selectivity relationships.

chemistry

methods
series design
the substituents to be introduced in the benzilic position of 2 (r in table 1) were selected following, as far
as possible, the criteria of minimum redundancy and
maximum variance in physicochemical properties. synthetic restraints limited the choice to a small number of
groups. the selection was based on the consideration of
the lipophilic, electronic and steric properties which
were parameterized by means of the substituent constants5 p, s* and mr, respectively. the r groups and
the physicochemical descriptors are shown in table 1.
the squared correlation matrix6 of the parameters is
reported in table 2, and it shows that a reasonable
orthogonality among the properties was obtained with
the selected series of substituents. this means that the
variation of each parameter within the series is independent from the variation of the others as indicated by
the low values of the squared correlation coecients. it
is remarkable that almost no collinearity exists between
the lipophilic (p) and steric (mr) parameters.

the compounds reported in this study were synthesized
by means of the mannich reaction on the appropriate 1substituted-1,1-diphenylpropan-2-one (3a±h) and piperidine hydrochloride in 2-methoxyethanol as high-boiling
solvent (2a±h, scheme 1). compound 2i was prepared

by reaction of 2a with chlorine in thf. compounds
2a±i were obtained as hydrochloride salts, because of
the better characterizability and stability. starting
ketones were commercially available (3a) or synthesized
according to literature methods (3b±f). compound 3g
was obtained from 1-chloro-1,1-diphenylpropan-2-one
and ethylmercaptan, in presence of anhydrous caco3.
oxidation of the ethylthio-derivative 3g with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mcpba) in ch2cl2 led to the sulfone
3h (scheme 2).
pharmacology
all the compounds were tested on m2 (guinea pig heart)
and m3 (guinea pig ileum) muscarinic receptor subtypes
for their antimuscarinic activity using arecaidine propargyl ester (ape) as agonist. compounds 2d and 2g
were also tested on m1 (rabbit vas deferens) and m4
(guinea pig lung) subtypes using p-cl-mcn-a-343 and
ape as agonists, respectively. the antagonist potency
was expressed as dissociation constant (pkb), and in
some cases pa2 values were also determined.
results and discussion
the antagonistic activities at the m2 and m3 muscarinic
receptors and the subtype selectivity of the new compounds studied are reported in table 1. the corresponding data of the previously published4  xxxd1907xxx 
analogue 2 are also shown. compounds 2a±i behave as
competitive (causing a parallel shift to the right of the
agonist dose±response curves) and noncompetitive (a
decrease of the maximum eect of the reference agonist
was present at 110ÿ5 m) antagonists at m2 and m3
subtypes, respectively (figs 1 and 2).
examination of the pkb values of table 1 reveals that
the introduction in position 1 of substituents dierent
from the hydroxylic group, always decreases the anity

dierences (5±525, for compounds 2i and 2g, respectively). the eects of the substitution are dierent in the
case of the  xxxg448xxx  subtype. in fact, while the cl
and och3 substituents slightly enhance the anity of
the corresponding compounds (2i and 2e, respectively)
for this subtype, all the others cause a moderate decrease
(up to sevenfold with compound 2a) in this parameter,
the only exception being the so2c2h5 substituent which
causes a remarkable fall (190 times) in the anity of

non-competitive behavior of the two antagonists.

compound 2h. as a consequence, the m2/m3 selectivity
pro®le of the antagonists 2a±g and 2i results reversed
compared with that of the reference compound 2, which
shows higher anity for the m3 subtype.
another interesting point is the dierence in the selective pro®le observed between compounds 2g and 2h
carrying sul®de and sulfone substituents, respectively.
the 310-fold dierence in selectivity (table 1) between
these two antagonists suggests that the two oxygens
in the substituent of compound 2h could play a
role in binding with the muscarinic receptor subsites. in particular, it seems possible to suppose that the
presence of two oxygen atoms improves the binding of
compound 2h at m3 subtype, while it hinders the binding of this compound at the m2 one. moreover, as
already pointed out,7 it seems that oxygen and sulfur
can dierentiate the behaviour of the muscarinic
antagonists: in fact, compounds 2f and 2g, which present substituents diering for oxygen (2f) and sulfur
(2g), display a tenfold dierence in selectivity (table 1).
since the m2/m3 selectivity ratios for compounds 2g
and 2d showed interesting values (62 and 16, respectively), we decided to complete the study of these two
antagonists testing them at m1 (rabbit vas deferens) and
m4 (guinea pig lung) muscarinic receptor subtypes as
well. in table 3, the whole results for these two ligands
are reported, from which their m2-selective pro®le
clearly emerges. actually, these compounds show m2
selectivity ratios ranging from 62 to >155 (2g) and
from 16 to >115 (2d), and therefore they can be considered as candidates for further development in an area
of great therapeutic interest as that of the treatment of
alzheimer's disease.
it is well known that the cholinergic system is involved
in memory and learning.8 although acetylcholine is not
the only neurotransmitter involved in alzheimer's disease,
an illness presenting degenerative alterations which occur
in certain brain regions involved in the cognitive processes, nevertheless the `cholinergic hypothesis' suggests
the restoration of central cholinergic tone in order to
alleviate and slow down the symptoms and the progress
of this disease.9 the presence of m1 and m2 muscarinic
receptors has been investigated in cortex and hippocampus with selective radioligands. m1 receptors control excitatory processes and are postsynaptically
located, whereas m2 receptors are mostly located presynaptically and modulate the release of acetylcholine.10

since m1 receptors are apparently untouched in these
areas of the brain of alzheimer's disease patients, a
possible mean of restoring central cholinergic tone is the
substitution of the reduced amount of acetylcholine
with exogenous m1 selective agonists.
on the other hand, since stimulation of m2 presynaptic
autoreceptors will reduce, and blockade will enhance the
acetylcholine release, the use of m2 selective antagonists
could improve memory and learning, amplifying the
physiological cholinergic transmission. the increase of
acetylcholine release will be so possible by blocking the
presynaptic m2 receptors with selective m2 antagonists
possessing the ability to penetrate the blood±brain barrier
but leaving unaected the postsynaptic m1 receptors.10
attempts to quantitatively correlate the observed anity data at both the m2 and  xxxg449xxx 
subtypes with the substituents' physico-chemical properties were carried out following the traditional hansch
method, but no signi®cant qsar equation could be
obtained. as an alternative approach, a factor analysis6
was performed on the matrix formed by the biological
and physico-chemical data of table 1. this method
allows one to extract the relevant information from a
data matrix and to calculate linearly independent
factors from the original variables. each factor corresponds to one of the eigenvalues of the matrix and, generally, only a few of them are needed to account for
most of the variance of the data. in the present case, as
shown in table 4, the ®rst three factors are able to
explain 94% of the variance, indicating that some
intercorrelation exists within the six (biological and
physicochemical) variables. looking at the loadings of
each original variable on to the relevant factors, it is
possible to see which variables are correlated. considering factor1, it appears that the selectivity ratio
(sel) and p are correlated to some extent, although
other variables contribute to that factor. factor2 is
mainly composed of pkb(m2) correlated with pkb(m3)
and mr; factor3 is mostly loaded by s*. factor1 also
shows a negative correlation between pkb(m3) and p,
which might explain the favorable eect of the latter
parameter on the m2 versus m3 selectivity. as regards
pkb(m2), it is not easy to say which physicochemical
variable (if any) has a quantitative eect on it, even if
mr (negative association in factor2) might play a role.
the important outcome of this analysis is the relationship between selectivity and lipophilicity, which can also

be shown by the plot of figure 3. the correlation
between the two variables is not sharp (r2=0.718), but
the trend is evident: increasing the lipophilicity of the
benzilic substituent (r) favors the anity for the m2
muscarinic receptor subtype rather than that for the m3
subtype. from inspection of the plot, it appears that the
eect of the sc2h5 substituent on selectivity is not only
strong, but also much stronger than its lipophilicity
would predict. the same seems to hold, even if at a lesser extent, also for the oc2h5 and och3 substituents.
the eect of the sc2h5 substituent on the m2 (and m1)
versus m3 selectivity was reported for a series of 2,2diphenyl-2-ethylthioacetic acid esters (4, rsc2h5)
developed as muscarinic antagonists structurally correlated to adiphenine (4, rh).11 in an attempt to
understand the chemical reasons at the basis of such an
eect, romanelli et al.12 performed an accurate theoretical study comparing the electronic and steric properties of the ethoxy- and ethylthio-groups. based on some
ligand±receptor models, and postulating that these substituents bind to a receptor pocket made by several
aromatic residues, the authors reached the conclusion
that sulfur derivatives are favored over oxygen analogues, because in the overall balance of the contributions

to the binding energy, repulsion forces favor oxygen
(due to its smaller size), but dispersion and electrostatic
forces favor sulfur (due to its higher polarizability and
lower electron density).
the similarity of the molecular skeletons on which the
substituent groups are introduced (the carbonyl analogue of  xxxd1907xxx , 2, and adiphenine, 4, rh) leads
us to believe that the results reported in the present
paper, as regards the eect of the sc2h5 group on the
m2/m3 selectivity, can be ascribed to the same reasons
outlined above. in such a context, it is reasonable that
lipophilicity exerts a generalized in¯uence on selectivity
(perhaps limiting the m3 anity), while more speci®c
interactions determine the binding anity of each single
compound to the dierent receptor subtypes.

finally, in a previous work,4 we hypothesized that the
bioactive conformation of these carbonyl-derivatives of
 xxxd1907xxx  might be one that exposes the pharmacophoric groups to the receptor in a favorable arrangement (5). at the light of the present results, namely the
relevant eect of the r substituents on both anity and
selectivity towards the m2 and  xxxg449xxx , we can
con®rm that hypothesis and point out the critical role of
r in recognizing and binding the dierent muscarinic
receptor subtypes.

conclusion

figure 3. plot of the m2/m3 selectivity (sel) versus lipophilicity (p).

a series of analogues of 2 was synthesized with the aim
of probing the eects of the benzilic substituent on the
anity and selectivity towards the m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes. in almost all the compounds
studied, replacing the oh group of 2 reduced the anity for both m2 and m3 subtypes, but the introduction
of some substituent caused dierent eects at the two
receptors. all substituents except so2c2h5 reversed the
m3-selective pro®le of the parent compound (2) up to
the point that we obtained some interesting m2-selective

1842

muscarinic antagonists. the increase in m2/m3 selectivity throughout the series roughly parallels the increase
in lipophilicity of the substituents, with the remarkable
exception of the sc2h5 group (compound 2g), which
leads to a much higher m2-selectivity than expected on
the basis of the lipophilicity alone. the most selective
compounds 2g and 2d were further characterized with
respect to the other muscarinic receptor subtypes (m1
and m4), and their m2-selective antimuscarinic pro®le
was con®rmed. in conclusion, our study led us to obtain
two m2-selective muscarinic antagonists, which might
be of potential interest in the ®eld of the alzheimer's
disease treatment, when the present data will be con®rmed with human cloned receptor binding studies.
further work will be devoted to the increase of the
antimuscarinic potency and to the improvement of the
physicochemical properties (lipophilicity) critical for
the pharmacokinetics of the central nervous system
drugs.

pharmacology
general considerations. male guinea pigs (200±300 g)
and male new zealand white rabbits (3.0±3.5 kg) were
killed by cervical dislocation. the organs required were
set up rapidly under 1 g of tension in 20 ml organ baths
containing physiological salt solution (pss) maintained
at an appropriate temperature (see below) and aerated
with 5% co2±95% o2. dose±response curves were
constructed by cumulative addition of the reference
agonist. the concentration of agonist in the organ bath
was increased approximately threefold at each step,
with each addition being made only after the response
to the previous addition had attained a maximal level
and remained steady. following 30 min of washing, tissues were incubated with the antagonist for 30 min, and
a new dose±response curve to the agonist was obtained.
contractions were recorded by means of a force transducer connected to a two-channel gemini polygraph
(u. basile). in all cases, parallel experiments in which
tissues received only the reference agonist were run in
order to check any variation in sensitivity.
guinea pig ileum. two-centimeter-long portions of
terminal ileum were taken at about 5 cm from the
ileum±cecum junction and mounted in pss, at 37 c, of
the following composition (mm): nacl (118), nahco3
(23.8), kcl (4.7),  xxxd2534xxx .7h2o (1.18), kh2po4 (1.18),
cacl2 (2.52), and glucose (11.7). tension changes were
recorded isotonically. tissues were equilibrated for
30 min, and dose±response curves to arecaidine propargyl
ester (ape) were obtained at 30 min intervals, the ®rst

one being discarded and the second one being taken as
the control.
guinea pig stimulated left atria. the heart was rapidly
removed, and the right and left atria were separately
excised. left atria were mounted in pss (the same used
for ileum) at 30 c and stimulated through platinum
electrodes by square-wave pulses (1 ms, 1 hz, 5±10 v)
(tetra stimulus, n. zagnoni). inotropic activity was
recorded isometrically. tissues were equilibrated for 2 h
and a cumulative dose±response curves to ape was
constructed.
guinea pig lung strips. the lungs were rapidly removed
and strips of peripheral lung tissue were cut either from
the body of a lower lobe with the longitudinal axis of
the strip parallel to the bronchus or from the peripheral
margin of the lobe. the preparations were mounted,
with a preload of 0.3 g, in pss with the following composition (mm): nacl (118.78), kcl (4.32), cacl2.2h2o
(2.52),  xxxd2534xxx .7h2o (1.18), kh2po4 (1.28), nahco3
(25), glucose (5.55). contractions were recorded isotonically at 37 c after tissues were equilibrated for 1 h,
then two cumulative dose±response curves to ape
(0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 mm) were obtained at 45 min intervals, the ®rst one being discarded and the second one
being taken as the control.
rabbit stimulated vas deferens. this preparation was set
up according to eltze.22 vasa deferentia were carefully
dissected free of surrounding tissue and were divided
into four segments, two prostatic portions of 1 cm and
two epididymal portions of approximately 1.5 cm
length. the four segments were mounted in pss with
the following composition (mm): nacl (118.4), kcl
(4.7), cacl2 (2.52), mgcl2 (0.6), kh2po4 (1.18),
nahco3 (25), glucose (11.1); 10ÿ6 m yohimbine was
included to block a2-adrenoceptors. the solution was
maintained at 30 c and tissues were stimulated through
platinum electrodes by square-wave pulses (0.1 ms,
2 hz, 10±15 v). contractions were measured isometrically after tissues were equilibrated for 1 h, then a
cumulative dose±response curve to p-cl-mcn-a-343
was constructed.
determination of antagonist potency. to quantify
antagonist potency, pkb values were calculated from the
equation pkb=log(dr-1)ÿlog[b], where dr is the
ratio of ed50 values of agonist after and before treatment with one or two antagonist concentration [b].23 in
some cases, antagonist potency is expressed in terms of
pa2, estimated by schild plots constrained to slope
ÿ1.0, as required by the theory.24,25
statistical analysis. values are given as mean  standard error of four or ®ve independent observations.
student's t-test was used to assess the statistical signi®cance of the dierence between two means.
