abstract
rationale many antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension possibly due to antagonist action on resistance vessel
alpha1a-adrenoceptors (alpha1a-ar).
objective we have tested this possibility by determining in
wistar rats how the orthostatic hypotensive effect of several
antipsychotic drugs compares with their affinity for
adrenoceptors in mesenteric small arteries (msa with
mainly alpha1a-ar) and aorta (mainly alpha1d-ar).
materials and methods using a tilt setup, orthostatic
hypotension was measured in anaesthetized rats for  xxxd3000xxx  and the antipsychotics haloperidol,  xxxd3195xxx ,  xxxd3129xxx , clozapine, ziprasidone,  xxxd1927xxx , olanzapine,
and aripiprazole. for in vitro studies, segments of msa and
aorta were mounted on a wire myograph for isometric
tension recording. cumulative concentration-response
curves were constructed to phenylephrine (pe) in the
absence and presence of the drugs. apparent affinity (pa2)
was calculated by schild analysis.

results  xxxd3000xxx  antagonized tilt-induced and pe responses
in both studies (threshold 4 ng/ml, pa2 9.52 msa, 10.1
aorta). the rank order of the potency of the antipsychotics
in the tilt experiments correlated (r2 =0.69, p=0.01) with
the pa2-values in msa:  xxxd3129xxx  and  xxxd3195xxx  had the
highest potency in the tilt test (threshold 159 and 97 ng/ml)
and the highest apparent affinity in msa (pa2 8.92 and
8.78), in contrast with aripiprazole and  xxxd1927xxx , which
had the lowest in each case (threshold 4.1 and 3.0 mug/ml,
pa2 7.17 and 6.99). in aorta, the pa2 values did not
correlate with the in vivo potencies; in particular,  xxxd3195xxx 
had no functional affinity in aorta.
conclusion we conclude that the orthostatic hypotensive
effect in rats of the antipsychotic drugs investigated is
mediated through alpha1a-ars.

antipsychotic drugs are used in the treatment of schizophrenia, a common psychotic disease that affects around
0.7–1% of the world population (williams et al. 2004).
almost all available antipsychotic drugs are dopamine d2receptor antagonists, and it is generally accepted that
antipsychotic effects are mediated through blockade of
mesolimbic d2 dopaminergic receptors (lewis and lieberman
2000). nevertheless, most antipsychotic drugs have effects
on other receptors such as serotonin 5-ht2 receptors,
muscarinic (m2) receptors, and alpha-adrenoceptors, particularly  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoceptors (buckley and sanders 2000; svensson
2003). extrapyramidal side effects (eps) in patients under
treatment with typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloper-

16

idol are mediated via striatal  xxxg656xxx 
blockade (lidow et al. 1998). these side effects are reduced
for the atypical drugs such as clozapine, possibly because of
lower affinity of atypical antipsychotics for d2-receptors and
greater affinity for 5ht2-receptors (strange 2001).
in addition to eps, the atypical antipsychotics like the
typical ones frequently have cardiovascular side effects
such as increase in the qt interval of the electrocardiogram
and orthostatic hypotension (buckley and sanders 2000).
the latter may be caused by their antagonist action against
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoceptors ( xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar). the importance of the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx 
component of these drugs as regards their antipsychotic
effects has been studied intensively (lane et al. 1988;
prinssen et al. 1994; wadenberg et al. 2000). however, the
role of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar subtype with respect to their cardiovascular
side effects, especially orthostatic hypotension, has received
little attention, and to our knowledge, there are no data to
show a direct comparison between in vivo and in vitro
effects of antipsychotics. we have therefore investigated the
hypothesis that the ability of antipsychotic drugs to cause
orthostatic hypotension is correlated to their  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar antagonist affinity (especially alpha1a-ar) on resistance vessels.
the hypothesis has been tested by comparing the rank
order of a range of antipsychotic drugs both in vivo in an
animal tilt model of orthostatic hypotension (take et al.
1998; hashimoto et al. 1999; hieble et al. 1999; akiyama
et al. 2002; de moura et al. 2005), and in vitro using
isolated rat mesenteric small arteries (msa) studied in a
myograph (mulvany and halpern 1977). these latter
vessels are important in the control of blood pressure
(fenger-gron et al. 1995) and contain mainly alpha1a-ar
(ipsen et al. 1997). in the in vivo experiments, the rank
order of the drugs was based on the lowest concentration to
give a detectable orthostatic hypotension response. in the in
vitro experiments, rank order was based on the apparent
affinity (pa2) of the drugs for alpha-ar, determined using
schild analysis of the contractile responses to pe. for
comparison, we also studied the alpha-ar affinities in rat
thoracic aorta, a vessel containing predominantly alpha1d-ar
(hussain and marshall 1997; marti et al. 2005).

materials and methods
this study was conducted in accordance with the current
danish animal testing act.
in vivo experiments
tilt setup
male normotensive wistar rats (220–250 g) were anesthetized with administration of pentobarbital (1%, 50 mg/kg)

psychopharmacology (2008) 199:15–27

intraperitoneally, in a volume of 5 ml/kg. during the
surgical implantation of the catheters, the anesthesia was
supplemented with isoflurane. the left common carotid
artery was cannulated with a polyethylene tube to monitor
the systemic arterial pressure and for final blood sampling.
systemic arterial pressure was monitored by a pressure
transducer (sensonor 844, sensonor, norway) placed at
the heart level so that the tilting itself did not influence
blood pressure measurement. the left jugular vein was
cannulated for administration of test drugs or vehicle. then,
the rats were fixed in the supine position with the fulcrum
of the customized tilt table at the level of the heart.
in vivo experimental procedure
observation of the tilt-induced blood pressure response in
rats has previously been described (take et al. 1998;
hashimoto et al. 1999; hieble et al. 1999; akiyama et al.
2002; de moura et al. 2005). in this study, the method has
been customized as follows. rats were rapidly (within 1–
2 s) subjected to a consistent 60° head-up tilt from the
horizontal position. this was considered as the pre-dose tilt.
if a normal blood pressure response was not observed
(immediate tilt-induced blood pressure <85% of pre-tilt
blood pressure and compensatory blood pressure response
>90% of pre-tilt blood pressure) within three pre-dose tilts
(10 min apart), the rat was omitted from the study. if more
than one pre-dose tilt was performed, the final tilt was used
in the analysis. vehicle or test drugs were administered
5 min after the pre-dose tilt. a similar post-dose tilt was
initiated 10 min after the test drug had been administered.
each tilt was timed to last 60 s.
each rat was injected once intravenously (i.v.) with one of
ten different compounds: vehicle (10% hydroxypropyl-betacyclodextrin, hpbetac),  xxxd3000xxx  (0.0011 to 0.044 mg/kg),
clozapine (0.1 to 3 mg/kg), ziprasidone (0.01 to 1 mg/kg),
 xxxd3195xxx  (0.1 to 5 mg/kg), aripirazol (1 to 30 mg/kg),
haloperidol (0.3 to 10 mg/kg),  xxxd3129xxx  (0.01 to 1 mg/kg),
olanzapine (0.01 to 3 mg/kg), and  xxxd1927xxx  (0.3 to
10 mg/kg). each drug was tested at three to six dose levels
(two to five animals per dose level). blood samples were
collected immediately after the end of the post-dose tilt for
measurement of drug plasma concentrations.
analysis of drug plasma concentration
analysis of plasma concentration for all tested drugs was
performed using turbulent flow chromatography followed
by detection using mass spectrometry (api 3000, mds
sciex, canada) according to a method described early
(sanchez and kreilgaard 2004). the concentration of
compounds in plasma was determined by standard calibration curves (1–1,000 ng/ml) for each analysis prepared

psychopharmacology (2008) 199:15–27

using ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (edta)-treated
plasma from untreated animals.
in vivo data analysis
continuous recording of blood pressure and mean arterial
blood pressure (map) was performed. exact values were
measured immediately before tilt (baseline at 0 s) and at 2,
5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 s after the start of tilt. due to
marked fall in map caused by i.v. injections of the test
drugs, the tilt response was expressed with reference to the
baseline value before the tilt (100%) plotted against time
after the start of tilt, from which the area under the curve
from 0 to 60 s (auc0–60) was calculated. the effect of the
dose of test drug on the tilt response was taken as deltaauc0–
60 =auc0–60 (pre-dose tilt)-auc0–60 (post-dose tilt). all
values are presented as mean ± sem.
statistical analyses of data were performed using a
computer program (graphpad prism, san diego, ca,
usa). a nonparametric test (kruskal-wallis) was used for
each drug to simultaneously determine significance over all
dosing levels. if there was overall significance, individual
comparisons were made to determine the possible significance of differences at each dosing level, compared to
vehicle (dunn’s test). statistical significance was set at
p<0.05. in the vehicle-administered animals, the pre-dose
tilt was compared to the post-dose tilt by a student’s t
test. for each drug, the plasma concentration of the lowest
dose that was found to be significantly different from
vehicle has been selected as an estimate of the potency of
each drug and, thereby, to generate the rank order between
the drugs.
in vitro experiments
rat isolated small mesenteric artery and aorta preparation
male wistar rats (300–350 g) were killed by cervical
dislocation, after which the mesentery or the aorta was
removed immediately and placed in cold physiological salt
solution (pss 4°c) of the following composition (mm):
nacl 119, kcl 4.7, cacl2 1.6,  xxxd2534xxx .7h2o 1.17,
nahco3 25, glucose 5.5, kh2po4 1.18, and edta
0.026. the solution was gassed with 5% co2 in air.
segments of thoracic aorta and mesenteric small arteries
(approximately 2 mm) cleaned of surrounding adipose
tissue were mounted as ring preparations on two 100- or
40-mum wires, respectively, in a wire myograph (j.p.
trading, aarhus, denmark). the vessels were allowed to
equilibrate in pss (thermostatically controlled at 37±0.5°c
for at least 30 min).
after the stabilization period, the internal diameter of
each vessel was set to an extension equivalent to 0.9 times

17

the estimated diameter at 100 mmhg effective transmural
pressure (l100 =200–250 mum) according to the standard
procedure of mulvany and halpern (1977). after examination of viability of vessels, as described below, the
endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the lumen
with a hair to confirm that the main function of the
antipsychotic drugs was the result of their action on smooth
muscle cells not on the endothelium. removal of the
endothelium was confirmed by the presence and absence of
relaxation to acetylcholine (ach, 10−5 m), before and after
removal, in mesenteric arteries precontracted with noradrenaline (na, 10−5 m). the presence of endothelium in
rat thoracic aorta, before and after removal, was tested
using phenylephrine (pe) 10−6 m as preconstrictor then
ach (3×10−6 m). experiments were only performed on
vessels that showed less than 10% relaxation after endothelial removal. in some experiments, where indicated, the
endothelium was not removed.
experimental procedure
mesenteric small arteries
after standardization of the internal diameter, the viability
of vessels was examined by exposing them to na 10−5 m
three times, 2 min per activation, with washouts after each
exposure. as described above, the function of the endothelium was assessed after the third exposure to na. after
removal of endothelium, the vessels were incubated with
propranolol (10−6 m) and cocaine (3×10−6 m) for at least
10 min to block beta-ar and neuronal uptake of na,
respectively.
initially, a pe concentration-response curve was
obtained by adding pe from 0.02 to 640 mum in twofold
increments to the bath every 2 min. the vessels were then
washed to baseline and incubated with test drug for 30 min.
a new concentration–response curve for pe was constructed in the presence of the drug. only one concentration
of the drug was used for each vessel.
aorta
the standard start for testing the viability of aorta
preparations was made by exposing them to na (10−6 m)
three times for 3 min per activation. after testing the
function of endothelium and its removal, as described
above, a curve for pe (3×10−9 m to 3×10−5 m) was
constructed in control condition (with vehicle) and in the
presence of propranolol (10−6 m), and yohimbine (10−7 m),
cocaine (6×10−6 m), and corticosterone 21-acetate (cca,
10−6 m) to block beta-ar,  xxxg831xxx -ar, neuronal, and extra
neuronal uptake of na, respectively. after the washing
and incubation of the vessels with antagonist for 30 min,

18

the second concentration–response curve for pe was
constructed as described above.
in vitro data analysis
the mechanical responses of the vessels were measured as
force and expressed as active wall tension, which is the
increase in measured force divided by twice the segment
length (mulvany and halpern 1977). responses are plotted
graphically as means from at least four separate experiments (one vessel per animal in each experiment), with
vertical lines representing sem. when error bars do not
appear on the figures, this is because they are small and fall
within the dimension of the symbols. curves were fitted
(graphpad prism, san diego, ca, usa) to all the data by
nonlinear regression to determine hill slopes for the agonist
concentration–response curves and to calculate pd2 values
(−log of the ec50 values). the ec50 value in the presence
and absence of test drug (antagonist) was used to determine
the concentration-ratio (cr). pa2 values were calculated by
linear regression by use of the same computer program and
were obtained from the x-intercept of the plot of log (cr-1)
against log molar antagonist concentration (arunlakshano
and schild 1959). slope values were evaluated for
statistical difference from unity by t test. statistical analysis
of concentration-response curves was performed using
two-way analysis of variance followed by bonferroni
post-test.

diluted in distilled water. all stock solutions for in vitro
experiments were stored frozen in aliquots and thawed and
diluted fresh daily. all test drugs for in vivo experiments
were dissolved in 10% hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin
(hpbetac) on the day of use and administered in a volume

the following drugs were used. noradrenalinehydrochloride (hcl),  xxxd2920xxx  (hcl) acetylcholine chloride,
cocaine (hcl),  xxxd3033xxx  (hcl), yohimbine (hcl),
corticosterone 21-acetate (cca), and  xxxd3000xxx  (hcl) were
all obtained from sigma (st. louis, usa).  xxxd3195xxx ,
 xxxd3129xxx , clozapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine were all synthesized and provided by h. lundbeck
a/s, denmark. haloperidol was purchased from sigma,

the combined use of pentobarbital and isoflurane gave a
satisfactory anesthesia that did not suppress the tilt
responses. thus, an almost complete compensation of
reflex responses was found to the initial tilt-induced drop
in blood pressure during the pre-dose tilt periods in
anesthetized rats (pre-dose tilt responses in fig. 1a). there
were no significant differences in the pressure responses
between pre-dose and post-dose tilt in the control (vehicle

administered) animals (table 1). as seen in fig. 1b,
administration of  xxxd3129xxx  (1 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited the
reflex response, which did not reestablish during the 60-s
post-dose tilt. deltaauc0–60 values and the mean of plasma
concentrations of drugs at the end of tilt procedure are
indicated in table 1. dose-dependent increases in the
deltaauc0–60 values were observed for all drugs except
aripiprazole and  xxxd1927xxx . haloperidol showed a
dose-dependent increase in deltaauc0–60, but the effect was
just not statistically significant (p=0.07; tables 1 and 2).
to estimate the drugs’ potencies to cause orthostatic
hypotension on the tilt setup, we have measured for each
drug investigated the plasma concentrations for each dose
(table 1). these measurements were then used to rank the
tested drugs based on the plasma concentration of the first
dose of drugs having a significant increase in deltaauc0–60
compared with vehicle (see table 1). as shown in table 2,
 xxxd3000xxx  (used as a positive control) has the highest rank
followed by  xxxd3195xxx , and thereafter in order  xxxd3129xxx ,
ziprasidone, olazapine, clozapine, haloperidol,  xxxd1927xxx , and aripiprazole. figure 2 shows the changes in
blood pressure during the 60° head-up tilt for 60 s after
administration of various doses of  xxxd3000xxx  and  xxxd3129xxx .
 xxxd3000xxx  at more than 0.022 mg/kg, i.v., completely
depressed the tilt induced blood pressure responses
(fig. 2a, table 1). although 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.v.
administration of  xxxd3129xxx  completely depressed the
responses, partial compensation was observed at 0.03 and
0.1 mg/kg (fig. 2b).
in vitro study
antagonism of pe responses in rat small mesenteric
arteries in vitro
in the rat mesenteric small artery, pe produced isometric
contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (pd2 =
6.24±0.02, n=11).  xxxd3000xxx  shifted the concentration–
response curve to pe markedly to the right (fig. 3a,
table 3). the responses to pe were antagonized by
 xxxd1927xxx ,  xxxd3129xxx , and  xxxd3195xxx  in a concentration-dependent manner with no depression in maximum
responses (figs. 3 and 4, table 3) and pa2 values 6.99,
8.92, and 8.78, respectively. none of the schild slopes
differed significantly from unity (table 3). for  xxxd3195xxx 
and  xxxd3129xxx , exactly the same results were obtained in
vessels where the endothelium had not been removed (n=
12, data not shown).
the responses to pe were also antagonized by the
presence of ziprasidone and aripiprazole (fig. 5), and
clozapine, haloperidol, and olanzapine (data not shown).
schild regression analysis carried out for these drugs
against pe gave pa2 values of 7.98, 7.17, 7.64, 7.64, and

19

7.35, respectively. the slopes of the schild plots were not
significantly different from unity, respectively (table 3).
the antagonists in table 3 are arranged in order of their pa2
values found in msa, with  xxxd3000xxx  having the greatest
affinity and  xxxd1927xxx  having the least.
antagonism of phenylephrine responses in rat aorta in vitro
phenylephrine produced concentration-dependent contractions of rat aorta (pd2 =7.33±0.04, n=9) with a greater
potency than that seen in the mesenteric small arteries (pd2 =
6.24, see above). the pe concentration–response curves
were markedly right-shifted by  xxxd3000xxx  (fig. 3b and
table 3).  xxxd3129xxx  antagonized the pe-concentration–
response curves in rat aorta with high affinity (pa2 value,
8.36) and no depression of the maximum response at the
higher concentration (fig. 4b, table 3).  xxxd3195xxx  produced
rightward shifts of the concentration–response curves to pe
(fig. 4e), and gave a schild slope that was greater than unity
(1.99, table 3). clozapine and haloperidol antagonized pe
responses in rat aorta with the same pa2 values (7.3) but
different schild slopes (table 3).
we performed schild analysis for ziprasidone on rat
aorta using six different concentration of ziprasidone
(fig. 5e). as ziprasidone gave similar rightward shifts of
the pe-concentration–response curves at concentrations 3×
10−7 and 5×10−7 m and very small rightward shift for
10−7 m (fig. 5e), we exposed the vessels with higher
concentrations of ziprasidone (10−6, 3×10−6, and 10−5 m),
and based on these, a low pa2 value was calculated (6.93)
with a schild slope that was not significantly different from
unity (table 3). calculated pa2 value for  xxxd1927xxx  was
6.11, with significant depression in maximum response at
10−5 m but a schild slope not significantly different from
unity (fig. 3e and table 3).
there was no rightward shift of the pe-concentration–
response curves in the presence of 10−6 m aripiprazole.
from the rightward shifts at two higher concentrations (3×
10−6 and 10−5 m, fig. 5b) pa2 value equal to 5.96 was
calculated. for olanzapine, pa2 values equal to 6.37 was
calculated with a schild slope that was not significantly
different from unity (table 3).
comparison of tilt test potencies and pa2 values in msa
and aorta
the calculated pa2 values for msa and aorta were similar
for  xxxd3000xxx ,  xxxd3129xxx , haloperidol, and clozapine.
markedly lower pa2 values were, however, seen in aorta
vs. msa for  xxxd3195xxx  (pa2 6.31 vs. 8.78) and to a lesser
extent for  xxxd1927xxx , olanzapine, and ziprasidone (pa2
6.11, 6.37, and 6.93 vs. 6.99, 7.35, and 7.98, respectively).
lowest affinity in aorta was found for aripiprazole, which

no dose-dependent effect and no significant effect at highest dose
were found. for each compound, the plasma concentration (cp) of the
first dose having a significant effect from the vehicle has been used to
generate the rank number.

orthostatic hypotension has been compared with the
functional affinity of these drugs for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar in separate
vascular subtype models in the same species. eight
antipsychotic drugs, plus  xxxd3000xxx  as a positive control,
were evaluated for their orthostatic hypotensive effect in
vivo, and their alpha1a- and alpha1d-ar antagonist apparent
affinities (pa2) have been determined in vitro in rat
mesenteric small arteries (msa) and rat thoracic aorta,
respectively. in the following, we refer to responses of
msa and aorta as alpha1a-ar and alpha1d-ar responses,
respectively. the results show a good agreement in the
rank order of the in vivo potencies and in vitro affinities for
alpha1a-ar but not for alpha1d-ar (table 3).
investigations employing functional, radioligand binding, and molecular methods have demonstrated the existence of a heterogeneous population of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar subtypes
throughout the vascular system (kenny et al. 1995; hussain
and marshall 1997; docherty 1998; hrometz et al. 1999).

each point shows the mean ±

although the messenger rna (mrna) encoding the three
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar subtypes is expressed in many arteries (piascik and
perez 2001), marti et al. (2005) found in a molecular and
functional study on msa and rat aorta that the alpha1a subtype
is the dominant subtype in msa (with 73% of mrna
level) compared with 79% of mrna level for the alpha1d
subtype in the rat aorta. a major functional role of alpha1a in
msa has also been proposed by other authors (ipsen et al.
1997; stam et al. 1999), whereas several lines of evidence
show that the alpha1d-subtype is the main functional  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar
subtype in rat aorta (hussain and marshall 1997; hrometz
et al. 1999; gisbert et al. 2003). although there are some
functional studies on spleen and liver indicating the
presence of alpha1b-ar in these tissues (sleight et al. 1993;
eltze 1996), as yet there is little direct evidence for the role
of the alpha1b-ar as a mediator of contractile function in
blood vessels (daly et al. 2002). this subtype has only
been identified at a low level (1.7–11.1%) of mrna in
peripheral vessels (marti et al. 2005), confirming previous
observations of the lack of alpha1b-ar in the vasculature
(piascik and perez 2001).
it is well known that peripheral vasodilators, specifically
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar blockers, such as  xxxd3000xxx  and terazosin, have the
potential to cause orthostatic hypotension (andros et al.
1996; poon and braun 2005). consistent with this, in the
present study, we found that  xxxd3000xxx  had a high potency to
cause orthostatic hypotension in our animal model, as well
as a high apparent affinity of  xxxd3000xxx  for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar in both
msa and rat aorta (pa2 9.5 and 10.1, respectively), in
agreement with previous studies (kenny et al. 1995;
hussain and marshall 1997; testa et al. 1997; stam et al.
1999). antipsychotic drugs also cause blockade of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar
(schotte et al. 1996; ipsen et al. 1997; richelson and
souder 2000; wadenberg et al. 2000; schmidt et al. 2001)
and also cause postural hypotension; for example, postural
hypotension was seen in 77% of the people receiving

fig. 3 phenylephrine concentration–response curves in the presence

and the vertical lines show the sem of at least four separate

antipsychotic drugs versus 15% receiving placebo (silver et
al. 1990). the side effect of postural hypotension with
antipsychotic drugs is thus believed to be mediated by their
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar antagonist affinity (casey 1996, 1997).
among the eight antipsychotic drugs investigated in this
study, there was a remarkable agreement (table 3) in the
rank orders of potency as regards the induction of
orthostatic hypotension and the apparent affinity of the
drugs for alpha1a-ar (as determined in msa). thus,  xxxd3129xxx  and  xxxd3195xxx  had the highest potency concerning
orthostatic hypotension and apparent affinity for alpha1a-ar,
in contrast to aripiprazole and  xxxd1927xxx , which show
the lowest potencies and affinities in these models. on the
other hand, the rank order of apparent affinity for alpha1d-ar (as
determined in aorta) showed little correlation with the rank
order of the other two assays (table 3). thus, for example,
the pa2 values for both  xxxd3129xxx  and  xxxd3195xxx  for the
alpha1a-ar were high (pa2 =8.92 and 8.78, respectively), but

their affinity for alpha1d-ar was very different (pa2 =8.36 and
6.31, respectively).
richelson and sounder (2000) showed that both  xxxd3129xxx  and  xxxd3195xxx  had high affinity for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar using
radioligand binding assay and post-morten normal human
brain tissue, but the subtypes involved were not investigated. in subtype studies, a high affinity of  xxxd3129xxx  for
alpha1a-ar has been found in isolated rat vas deferens (eltze
1996), although this was not the case for rat hippocampus
(sleight et al. 1993). to our knowledge, there are no data
on  xxxd3129xxx  affinity for alpha1d-ar, but low (eltze 1996)
and high (sleight et al. 1993) affinity for alpha1b-ar has been
reported in guinea pig/mouse spleen and rat hippocampus,
respectively. as regards  xxxd3195xxx , the present data confirm
previous data from our laboratory, showing that this drug is
approximately 300-fold selective for alpha1a-ar compared to
alpha1d-ar; indeed, the high schild slope seen here in the
aorta experiments (1.99) suggests that  xxxd3195xxx  has little

functional affinity for the alpha1d-ar. the significance of the
low affinity for alpha1d-ar is not known. the similarity
between studies on msa with and without endothelium
confirms that the action of the tested compounds ( xxxd3129xxx  and  xxxd3195xxx ) is being mediated through effects on
the vascular smooth muscle.
consistent with the high alpha1a-ar affinity of  xxxd3129xxx 
and  xxxd3195xxx , and the high potency of these drugs in the tilt
test, the incidence of dizziness in patients taking  xxxd3195xxx 
(sramek et al. 1997) and  xxxd3129xxx  (barnes and mcphillips
1999) appears to be quite high. for  xxxd3129xxx , the high
affinity of  xxxd3129xxx  for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar compared to the low
affinity for dopamine d2 receptors can explain the high risk
(48%) of orthostatic hypotension (poon and braun 2005). in
a case report study, postural hypotension, tachycardia, and
syncope have been reported in a patient taking a relatively
small overdose of  xxxd3129xxx  (kopala et al. 1998).
aripiprazole is the first atypical antipsychotic that has
potent partial agonist activity at dopamine d2 and 5-ht1a
receptors (burris et al. 2002; jordan et al. 2002). in the

psychopharmacology (2008) 199:15–27

present in vivo investigation, no significant effects were
found at the highest doses of aripiprazole (table 2). the
pa2 value for aripiprazole on alpha1a-ar (7.17) was also
relatively low, which is in concordance with the lack of
reported orthostatic hypotension in clinical studies (keck
and mcelroy 2003), a potential benefit of this drug.
clinical studies have confirmed that  xxxd1927xxx , as a
d2-antagonist that does not cross the blood–brain barrier, is
an effective treatment for preventing early orthostatic
hypotension in parkinson’s patients under dopamine agonist therapy (lang et al. 1990; sigurdardottir et al. 2001).
such orthostatic hypotension is often found with initiation
of dopamine agonist therapy, particularly in parkinson’s
disease, and is thought to be caused by venous and arterial
dilation through inhibition of the sympathetic nervous
system (kujawa et al. 2000). our finding of a low potency
of  xxxd1927xxx  for orthostatic hypotension in the tilt model
and a relatively low affinity of  xxxd1927xxx  on msa (pa2 =
6.99) is consistent with the relatively low incidence of
orthostatic hypotension when used as a peripheral dopamine antagonist (lopes et al. 1988).
the relatively low affinity of olanzapine for both investigated  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar subtypes in the present study compared with
ziprasidone is in agreement with the study of schmidt et al.
(2001). it was therefore unexpected that olanzapine showed
a relatively high potency in the tilt test, and the reason for
this discrepancy is not clear. clinically, olanzapine has a low
orthostatic effect (beasley et al. 1997), but this is thought to
be due to the relatively high affinity of olanzapine for
dopamine d2 receptors compared to its affinity for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar
(schmidt et al. 2001). radioligand binding studies with
ziprasidone by schmidt et al. (2001) also identified a lower
affinity of ziprasidone for human  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar compared to its
dopamine d2 receptors, suggesting that also ziprasidone may
have a lower potential to produce orthostatic hypotension in
the clinic, but clinical data are lacking.
the anomalous schild analysis for ziprasidone on rat
aorta was unexpected. here, despite repeated tests, a large
gap between phenylephrine concentration–response curves
at 5×10−7 and 10−6 m ziprasidone with depression of the
maximum responses at higher concentrations compared to
small right shifts without depression in maximum responses
by lower concentrations 10−7, 3×10−7, and 5×10–7 m of
ziprasidone. this behaviour of ziprasidone might be due to
partial agonist activity at alpha1d-ar, but this possibility is not
supported by our finding that the schild slope was unity;
thus, further experiments are required to elucidate this
anomaly.
the similar potencies in the tilt test for clozapine and
haloperidol, and the similar pa2 values for alpha1a-ar found
in the present investigation are consistent with the similar
affinity of clozapine and haloperidol for human  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -ar
reported previously (schmidt et al. 2001). clinical data on

25

the orthostatic effects of clozapine are limited, but there are
several reports that these are found in some patients
(tuunainen et al. 2002). the findings of the present study
are concerned with the acute effects of the drugs investigated. it is, however, well known that the orthostatic
hypotensive action of antipsychotics is strongest at the start
of treatment and that the effect diminishes over the
following days and weeks. the reason for this tolerability
is not clear (stanniland and taylor 2000). the present study
should therefore be considered as providing information
that may be relevant for the initial stages of antipsychotic
treatment. on this basis, the ability of the antipsychotic
drugs, at the higher doses, to prevent recovery of blood
pressure during the tilt test (fig. 2) is consistent with the
drug-induced orthostatic hypotension being mediated
through the peripheral vascular adrenoceptors. however,
as with the exception of  xxxd1927xxx , all the drugs pass the
blood–brain barrier, a central contribution to their action
cannot be entirely excluded.
in summary, for most of the antipsychotics investigated in
the present study, there was a good correlation between the in
vivo potency to induce orthostatic hypotension and the affinity
for alpha1a-ar, except olanzapine, which showed slightly
higher in vivo potency than expected from the in vitro
affinity results. no obvious correlation was found between in
vivo effects and affinity toward alpha1d-ar. therefore, based on
the present comparative functional study, we conclude that
alpha1a-ar are mainly responsible for the orthostatic hypotensive effect of treatment of the rats. whether this is also the
case in man remains to be determined.
