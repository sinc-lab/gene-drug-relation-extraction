effects of androgen treatment on expression of macrophage fcgamma receptors.  macrophage fcgamma receptors (fcgammars) play an important role in the host defense against infection and in the pathophysiology of immune cytopenias. modulation of macrophage fcgammar expression is a potential therapeutic approach to immune disorders. glucocorticoids and progesterones decrease macrophage fcgammar expression. we assessed the effect of treatment with androgens and antiandrogens on the expression of macrophage fcgammars using an experimental guinea pig model. four androgens (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, mesterolone, and  xxxd1806xxx ) and five antiandrogens ( xxxd2143xxx ,  xxxd2725xxx ,  xxxd1786xxx , spironolactone, and finasteride) were studied. following in vivo treatment of guinea pigs, we determined the clearance of immunoglobulin g (igg)-sensitized erythrocytes in vivo, the binding of igg-sensitized erythrocytes by isolated splenic macrophages, and splenic macrophage fcgammar cell surface expression. all of the androgens impaired the clearance of igg-sensitized erythrocytes by decreasing splenic macrophage fcgammar expression. dihydrotestosterone and mesterolone were more effective than testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the androgens decreased the cell surface expression of fcgammar1,2 more than that of fcgammar2. antiandrogens did not significantly alter macrophage fcgammar expression. nevertheless, antiandrogens counteracted the effects of androgens on macrophage fcgammar expression. these data indicate that androgens impair the clearance of igg-coated cells by decreasing splenic macrophage fcgammar expression. thus, androgens other than  xxxd1806xxx  are candidate drugs for the treatment of immune disorders.
