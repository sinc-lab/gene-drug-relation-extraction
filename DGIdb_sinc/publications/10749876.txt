proliferation (5, 6), and platelet adhesion to the endothelial
surface (7). impaired endothelium-derived no bioactivity is a
common feature of many vascular diseases (8 –10) that is
thought to contribute to their clinical manifestations (11, 12).
the action of no is particularly sensitive to the local availability of superoxide. both endothelial elaboration of no and
arterial relaxation in response to nitrovasodilators are dependent upon intact copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (sod) activity (13, 14). animal models of hypercholesterolemia (15, 16)
and hypertension (17) demonstrate an excess vascular superoxide flux that is linked to reduced no bioactivity. conversely,
increasing vascular sod activity enhances no-mediated arterial relaxation in experimental models of atherosclerosis (18,
19) and hypertension (17). thus, scavenging superoxide has
important implications for no bioactivity under both normal
and pathologic conditions.
 xxxd228xxx  also efficiently scavenges superoxide (20) and
numerous studies in a host of pathologic conditions such as
diabetes (21), hypercholesterolemia (22), smoking (23), and
hypertension (24) indicate that no bioactivity is improved by
parenteral  xxxd228xxx  at supraphysiologic concentrations
(⬃10 mm). we have observed enhanced no bioactivity in atherosclerotic patients after both acute (25) and chronic (1 month)
(26) oral  xxxd228xxx  administration. with respect to these
latter two observations, the role of superoxide scavenging is
unclear. in particular, kinetic constraints indicate that extracellular  xxxd228xxx  concentrations in these studies (⬃100 ␮m)
cannot preserve no bioactivity through superoxide scavenging
(27). the purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate
the role of intracellular  xxxd228xxx  on endothelial no
bioactivity.
experimental procedures

materials—medium m-199, minimal essential medium, fetal bovine
serum (fbs), penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from life
technologies, inc. [3h]l-arginine (10.2 ci/mmol) and [14c] xxxd228xxx 
(8 mci/mmol) were obtained from nen life science products.  xxxd3166xxx  ( xxxd3166xxx ) was from research biochemical international
(natick, ma). 2,3-diaminonaphthalene was purchased from molecular
probes (eugene, or), and dowex ag 50w-x8 resin was from bio-rad.
all other chemicals were obtained from sigma. solutions of authentic
no (⬃1 mm) were prepared in helium-deoxygenated distilled water as
described (28).
cell culture—porcine aortic endothelial cells (paecs) were harvested from pig aorta using standard techniques and grown in m-199
supplemented with 15% fbs, 10 ␮g/ml heparin sulfate, and antibiotics.
cells were grown in t75 flasks coated with fibronectin and passaged
using calcium and magnesium-free hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  and
trypsin-edta. cultures were used up to passage 6 and exhibited typical endothelial cell morphology and positive staining for factor viiirelated antigens.
endothelial  xxxd228xxx —for determination of  xxxd228xxx  content, media or cell lysates were precipitated with an equal volume of 5%

 xxxd228xxx  enhances no bioactivity in patients
with vascular disease through unclear mechanism(s).
we investigated the role of intracellular  xxxd228xxx  in
endothelium-derived no bioactivity. incubation of porcine aortic endothelial cells (paecs) with  xxxd228xxx 
produced time- and dose-dependent intracellular  xxxd228xxx  accumulation that enhanced no bioactivity by
70% measured as a23187-induced cgmp accumulation.
this effect was due to enhanced no production because
ascorbate stimulated both paec nitrogen oxide (no2ⴚ ⴙ
no3⫺) production and l-arginine to  xxxd2429xxx  conversion by 59 and 72%, respectively, without altering the
cgmp response to authentic no.  xxxd228xxx  also stimulated the catalytic activity of  xxxg1579xxx  derived from either
paec membrane fractions or baculovirus-infected sf9
cells.  xxxd228xxx  enhanced bovine  xxxg1579xxx  vmax by
⬃50% without altering the km for l-arginine. the effect
of ascorbate was  xxxd3166xxx  ( xxxd3166xxx )-dependent,
because ascorbate was ineffective with  xxxd3166xxx  concentrations >10 ␮m or in paecs treated with sepiapterin to
increase intracellular  xxxd3166xxx . the effect of  xxxd228xxx 
was also specific because a23187-stimulated cgmp accumulation in paecs was insensitive to intracellular
glutathione manipulation and only  xxxd228xxx , not
glutathione, increased the intracellular concentration
of  xxxd3166xxx . these data suggest that  xxxd228xxx  enhances
no bioactivity in a  xxxd3166xxx -dependent manner by increasing intracellular  xxxd3166xxx  content.

chosen to minimize artificial  xxxg1579xxx  superoxide production observed
with higher concentrations (⬎1 ␮m) of flavins (34). reactions were
initiated by the addition of 0.1– 0.25 ␮g of bovine  xxxg1579xxx  or 150 –200 ␮g
of membrane protein and were stopped after 0 – 40 min at 37 °c by 1 ml
of ice-cold stop buffer containing 20 mm sodium acetate, ph 5.5, 1 mm
 xxxd2429xxx , 2 mm edta, and 2 mm egta. samples were then applied
to 0.8-ml dowex ag50w-x8 columns pre-equilibrated with stop buffer.
 xxxd2429xxx  was eluted twice with 1 ml of h2o, and the 3-ml eluent was
collected for determination of [3h] xxxd2429xxx  by scintillation counting.
reactions were inhibited ⬎95% by 200 ␮m l-name or the omission of
cacl2. the eluate typically contained ⬍1% [3h]l-arginine based upon
parallel run controls without enzyme.
intracellular gsh and  xxxd3166xxx —intracellular gsh was
estimated from the acid-soluble supernatant of paecs lysed with 5%
metaphosphoric acid/0.1 mm dtpa using an ellman assay modified as
described (35).  xxxd3166xxx  was determined as described (36)
with some modifications. paecs from four 150-mm dishes were collected with trypsin-edta and lysed with ph 3 hplc grade water
containing 100 mm dithioerythritol and 100 ␮m dtpa, centrifuged at
13,000 ⫻ g for 10 min, and the supernatant and pellet were frozen
immediately on dry ice and stored at ⫺80 °c until analysis. samples
processed in this manner are stable for at least 1 year (36). for analysis,
thawed samples were resolved with hplc using a 25-cm lc18 reversephase column (supelco, bellefonte, pa) with a mobile phase of 50 mm
sodium acetate, 5.2 mm citrate, 60 ␮m edta, 160 ␮m dithioerythritol,
and 5% methanol, ph 5.22. quantification of  xxxd3166xxx  was accomplished
with electrochemical detection at an applied potential of ⫹0.12v using
a hewlett packard series 1050 chemstation. under these conditions,
biopterin and dihydrobiopterin are not detected.
data analysis—values are presented as the means ⫾ s.e. dose
response relationships were evaluated using one-way anova and an
appropriate post hoc comparison. instances involving only two comparisons were evaluated with a student’s t test. statistical significance was
accepted if the null hypothesis was rejected with a p ⬍ 0.05.

endothelial cell  xxxd228xxx  status and no bioactivity—
consistent with previous reports (37), we found that cultured
cells from passages 2– 6 contained undetectable levels of  xxxd228xxx  by hplc (⬍0.1 nmol/mg protein), likely because of low
levels of ascorbate even in freshly obtained  xxxd1728xxx  (⬍0.1 ␮m).
paecs demonstrated dose- and time-dependent uptake of
 xxxd228xxx  from the media (fig. 1, a and b) with a plateau in
intracellular  xxxd228xxx  after 5 h (14.7 ⫾ 1.2 nmol/mg protein; n ⫽ 3) that was stable up to 24 h (fig. 1a). intracellular
 xxxd228xxx  also saturated at ⬃20 nmol/mg protein with 75 ␮m
extracellular  xxxd228xxx  during a 5-h incubation (fig. 1b).
calcium ionophore significantly increased endothelial cell
cgmp from a basal level of 5.3 ⫾ 0.8 pmol/mg protein to 58.2 ⫾
20.2 pmol/mg protein (n ⫽ 4, p ⬍ 0.01; data not shown). this
increase in cgmp was inhibited ⬃98% to 6.4 ⫾ 1.9 pmol/mg
protein (n ⫽ 3) in cells treated with 300 ␮m l-name (p ⬍ 0.01
by student’s t test, data not shown). as shown in fig. 1c,
paecs treated with  xxxd228xxx  for 5 h demonstrated a dosedependent increase in a23187-stimulated cgmp accumulation
that closely paralleled  xxxd228xxx  uptake (fig. 1b). the maximum stimulation of a23187-induced cgmp accumulation with
 xxxd228xxx  was 170 ⫾ 14% of the untreated control (fig. 1c;
p ⬍ 0.01 for  xxxd228xxx  dose-response by anova). to determine whether increased intracellular sod activity would
mimic the effect of  xxxd228xxx , we treated cells with mn(iii)
tetrakis(4- xxxd306xxx )porphyrin (50 ␮m), a cell-permeable
sod mimic (38, 39), but did not observe any increase in
a23187-stimulated cgmp accumulation (102.7 ⫾ 8.4% of
control).
to determine whether  xxxd228xxx  altered the response to
exogenous no, we examined its effect on endothelial cgmp
accumulation in response to authentic no and sodium nitroprusside. paecs incubated with 75 ␮m  xxxd228xxx  for 5 h did
not demonstrate any change in cgmp accumulation in response to either sodium nitroprusside (fig. 2a) or authentic
no (fig. 2b). moreover,  xxxd228xxx  also did not significantly

using paired ion, reverse-phase hplc with electrochemical detection as
described (29). uptake of  xxxd228xxx  was determined using [14c]lascorbic acid. paecs were incubated with varying concentrations of
[14c]l- xxxd228xxx , washed three times with pbs, and lysed in 60%
methanol and 1 mm edta. intracellular [14c]l- xxxd228xxx  was determined by scintillation counting, and 100% of the intracellular radioactivity co-eluted with authentic l- xxxd228xxx  on paired ion, reversephase hplc.
assay of endothelium-derived no—we assayed endothelium-derived no as the accumulation of cgmp in response to 1 ␮m a23187.
confluent paecs in 12-well plates were equilibrated for 30 min in
hepes-buffered physiologic salt solution (pss) containing 22 mm
hepes, ph 7.4, 124 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1.5 mm cacl2,
0.16 mm hpo4, 0.4 mm h2po4, 5 mm nahco3, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 ␮m
indomethacin, and 200 ␮m  xxxd2388xxx . equilibrated
cells were then stimulated with a23187 or vehicle for 5 min and lysed
by the addition of 6% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. cell lysates were
subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 ⫻ g for 10 min, and both the
supernatant and pellet were stored at ⫺70 °c until analysis. determination of cgmp in supernatants was performed as described (30). the
cell pellet protein content was determined by the bca protein assay
(pierce) after solubilization with naoh.
endothelial production of no2⫺ and no3⫺—paecs in 6-well plates
were incubated in phenol red-free minimal essential medium in the

l-arginine for 8 h, and no2 ⫹ no3 was determined using the method
of miles and colleagues (31).
western blotting—paecs in 60-mm dishes were incubated with or
without  xxxd228xxx  in  xxxd1728xxx /fbs for 5 or 24 h and lysed in 50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.5, containing 1% nonidet p-40 and protease inhibitors.
an aliquot of lysate was mixed with laemmli buffer followed by boiling
for 5 min. cellular proteins (20 ␮g) were resolved on 7% sds-page and
transferred onto nitrocellulose (amersham pharmacia biotech). membranes were incubated with a 1:2500 dilution of mouse mab raised
against human  xxxg1579xxx  (transduction laboratories, lexington, ky) followed by goat anti-mouse igg peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and  xxxg1579xxx  visualized using the ecl chemiluminescence kit (amersham pharmacia biotech).
expression and purification of  xxxg1579xxx —the generation of baculovirus
vector for expression of bovine  xxxg1579xxx  has been described previously (32,
33). briefly, sf9 insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of
5 in hemin chloride (1 ␮g/ml) containing grace’s medium. cells were
harvested 3 days after infection and lysed on ice for 30 min in buffer a
(1% triton x-100 in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 ␮g/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, soybean
 xxxd207xxx , and pepstatin a). the lysate was mixed with 1 ml of
buffer a-equilibrated 2⬘,5⬘-adp-sepharose beads for at least 30 min.
the slurry was washed twice with 20 volumes of 0.5 m nacl and 2 mm
egta in buffer b (buffer a with 20% glycerol and no triton x-100), and
twice with 20 volumes of buffer b alone. bound  xxxg1579xxx  was eluted with
10 mm nadph in buffer b. isolated  xxxg1579xxx  was used immediately for
experiments and typically demonstrated a specific activity for citrulline
production of 50 –100 nmol/mg/min.
paec membrane preparations—confluent paecs in a t75 flask
were suspended in pbs with a rubber policeman and washed twice with
pbs. harvested cells were sonicated in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 100 ␮m dtpa, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 65,000 rpm for 60 min using a
beckman ti70 rotor. the pellet was then resolubilized by gentle rocking
in lysis buffer with 1 mm chaps for 2 h. the protein concentration in
solublized membrane preparations was determined by the bca protein
assay (bio-rad), and membrane fractions were prepared in this manner

[3h]l-arginine to [3h] xxxd2429xxx  conversion—for intact cell assays,
paecs in 6-well plates were washed and incubated in pss for 30 min
followed by treatment with 200 ␮m l-arginine containing 25 ␮ci of
[3h]l-arginine. after 30 min, cells were stimulated with 1 ␮m a23187

chromatography as described below. total [3h]l-arginine uptake was
determined by liquid scintillation counting of total lysate aliquots prior
to anion exchange chromatography and did not vary as a function of

 xxxd228xxx  and endothelial no production—to determine whether  xxxd228xxx  enhances no bioactivity as a function of no production, we examined its effect on no2⫺ ⫹ no3⫺
(nox) production from paec cultures. stimulation of paecs
with 0.1 ␮m a23187 increased nox approximately 72% from
basal levels of 251 ⫾ 40 pmol/106cells/8 h to 433 ⫾ 72 pmol/
106cells/8 h (fig. 3a; p ⬍ 0.05). in paecs treated with 75 ␮m
 xxxd228xxx  for 5 h, a23187-stimulated nox was 290 ⫾ 40
pmol/106cells/8 h, an increase of 59% compared with 182 ⫾ 45
pmol/106cells/8 h in control cells (fig. 3b; p ⬍ 0.05). western
blots of total cellular proteins revealed no significant effect of
 xxxd228xxx  on  xxxg1579xxx  protein (fig. 3c).
 xxxd228xxx  and  xxxg1579xxx  enzymatic activity—as shown in
fig. 4a, paecs loaded with  xxxd228xxx  exhibited a ⬃73%
increase in  xxxg1579xxx  enzymatic activity manifested as [3h] xxxd2429xxx  production from 251 ⫾ 40 pmol/106 cells to 433 ⫾ 72
pmol/106 cells (p ⬍ 0.001). there was no effect of  xxxd228xxx 
on the time-dependent uptake of [3h]l-arginine (data not
shown). paec membrane fractions converted [3h]l-arginine to
[3h] xxxd2429xxx  at a rate of 41.7 ⫾ 2.1 pmol/mg/min. this ac-

tivity was heat-labile and inhibited by ⬎99% to 0.1 ⫾ 0.4
pmol/mg/min by 200 ␮m l-name (fig. 4b).  xxxd228xxx  over
the intracellular concentration range (0.1–5 mm) significantly
increased the rate of l-arginine conversion in paec membrane
fractions (fig. 4b), whereas copper-zinc sod (0.01–1 ␮m) had
no significant effect on  xxxg1579xxx  activity in paec membranes
(98 ⫾ 2% of control, data not shown). similar effects were seen
using purified recombinant bovine  xxxg1579xxx  (fig. 4c).
because we observed optimal stimulation of  xxxg1579xxx  activity
with 5 mm  xxxd228xxx , we examined its effects on enzyme
kinetics using this concentration. as shown in fig. 5a, the
substrate dependence of  xxxg1579xxx  demonstrated saturation with
an upward shift in response to 5 mm  xxxd228xxx . lineweaverburk analysis confirmed that  xxxd228xxx  significantly increased  xxxg1579xxx  vmax approximately 50% from 38.6 ⫾ 0.6 nmol/
mg/min to 57.2 ⫾ 4.7 nmol/mg/min (p ⬍ 0.05 by t test, n ⫽ 3)

 xxxd228xxx  and  xxxd3166xxx —the activity of all nos isoforms is
dependent upon the presence of  xxxd3166xxx  that is bound to the
enzyme in its physiologic state (40 – 43). we examined the role
of  xxxd3166xxx  in the effect of  xxxd228xxx  on  xxxg1579xxx  activity. at
concentrations of  xxxd3166xxx  below 10 ␮m, we observed a profound
stimulatory effect of  xxxd228xxx  (5 mm) on  xxxg1579xxx  activity,
whereas higher concentrations of  xxxd3166xxx  produced  xxxg1579xxx  activity

discussion

the major finding of this study is that intracellular ascorbic
acid status is an important determinant of endothelial cell no

production, principally because of increased intracellular  xxxd3166xxx .
we found that endothelial cells demonstrated enhanced enosmediated cgmp accumulation as a function of increasing intracellular  xxxd228xxx  (fig. 1). we interpret this enhanced
no bioactivity with  xxxd228xxx  to reflect an absolute increase
in the amount of no produced by endothelial cells. in support
of this interpretation,  xxxd228xxx  had no effect on the cgmp
response to exogenous no (fig. 2), and endothelial cells containing  xxxd228xxx  produced more  xxxd2429xxx  and no2⫺ ⫹
no3⫺ than cells not containing ascorbate (fig. 3). in addition,
the enzymatic activity of  xxxg1579xxx  was enhanced (via increased
vmax) by  xxxd228xxx  at concentrations that are physiologically relevant (0.1–5 mm). we also found that  xxxd228xxx 
enhanced  xxxg1579xxx  catalysis in a manner that is dependent upon
 xxxd3166xxx . in particular, the stimulatory effect of  xxxd228xxx  on
 xxxg1579xxx  was lost with  xxxd3166xxx  concentrations exceeding 10 ␮m and in
endothelial cells treated with sepiapterin, an agent that increases intracellular  xxxd3166xxx  levels (fig. 6) (45– 47). although the
effect of  xxxd228xxx  on isolated  xxxg1579xxx  was mimicked by gsh
(fig. 7b), we found that the effects of  xxxd228xxx  and gsh on

endothelial cell no bioactivity were distinct. in contrast to
 xxxd228xxx , manipulation of intracellular gsh status had no
effect on no bioactivity. the mechanism for this distinction
relates to our observation that intracellular  xxxd228xxx , but
not gsh, appears to be an important determinant of endothelial cell  xxxd3166xxx  content.
a potential role for reductants in no production has been
proposed for the neuronal isoform of nos ( xxxg1577xxx ). komori
and colleagues (48) found that  xxxg1577xxx  purified in the absence
of thiols was stimulated 4 –7-fold by glutathione, cysteine,
dithiothreitol, and ␤- xxxd26xxx . because a similar effect was observed for  xxxg1912xxx , the authors
proposed a mechanism involving the reduction of dihydrobiopterin to  xxxd3166xxx . in that study,  xxxd228xxx  was not an
effective replacement for thiols (48). this latter finding contrasts with that of hofmann and schmidt (49), who demonstrated that glutathione,  xxxg1912xxx , and
 xxxd228xxx  were interchangeable in stimulating  xxxg1577xxx  activity. the latter two reagents, however, were not effective in
preventing  xxxg1577xxx  inactivation during catalysis. thus, there
is precedent for stimulation of nos activity in the presence of
reducing agents.
the data presented here extend these previous studies to
 xxxg1579xxx , demonstrating that  xxxd228xxx  at a concentration of 5
mm stimulated bovine  xxxg1579xxx  enzymatic activity ⬃80%, a value
that is in excellent agreement with its ⬃70 –90% stimulatory

63

effect on  xxxg1577xxx  (49). our results are also in excellent agreement with a recent report by heller and colleagues (50) who
found that human endothelial cells treated with  xxxd228xxx 
demonstrated enhanced no production as determined by lcitrulline formation and cgmp accumulation in response to
both  xxxd2379xxx  and thrombin. using a number of  xxxd228xxx 
derivatives, these authors found that the reductive capacity of
 xxxd228xxx  was an important component of its action and
that ascorbate had no effect on l-arginine uptake, an important
determinant of endothelial no bioactivity (51). our data provide some additional mechanistic insight into the action of
 xxxd228xxx . we were unable to duplicate the effect of ascorbic
acid with physiologic concentrations of sod, suggesting that
superoxide scavenging by ascorbate is not involved in  xxxg1579xxx 
stimulation. this finding is consistent with our report demonstrating that  xxxd228xxx  is a poor substitute for sod (27).
moreover, we observed that  xxxd228xxx  stimulated  xxxg1579xxx 
activity principally as a result of an increase in the enzyme
vmax without any effect on l-arginine binding as the km for
l-arginine remained unchanged (fig. 5). thus, there is precedent for stimulation of nos activity with  xxxd228xxx , and the
mechanism for this effect is unrelated to superoxide or
l-arginine.
we did observe that the effect of  xxxd228xxx  was dependent
upon the concentration of  xxxd3166xxx  in both isolated enzyme preparations and intact cells (fig. 6). in this regard, several aspects

of  xxxd3166xxx  warrant consideration. only the completely reduced
(tetrahydro) form of biopterin supports nos coupling of
nadph oxidation to no synthesis (52). because nos catalysis
is associated with oxidation of  xxxd3166xxx  (53, 54) and  xxxd228xxx 
has been proposed to maintain  xxxd3166xxx  in a reduced state (55), one
might speculate that  xxxd228xxx  simply maintains  xxxd3166xxx  in its
reduced state. indeed, our experiments with bovine  xxxg1579xxx  from
sf9 cells would tend to support such an argument because
 xxxd228xxx  was ineffective with saturating  xxxd3166xxx  levels and
gsh could substitute for  xxxd3166xxx . however, this line of reasoning
would also predict equivalent effects on no bioactivity with the
intracellular manipulation of either  xxxd228xxx  or gsh, a
prediction clearly inconsistent with the data presented here
(figs. 1 and 7). the major distinction between intracellular
gsh and  xxxd228xxx  manipulation in this study was the
activity of  xxxd228xxx  alone to increase endothelial cell  xxxd3166xxx 
content. the precise mechanism for this observation is not yet
clear but may relate to the prevention of intracellular  xxxd3166xxx 
oxidation or some effect of ascorbate on  xxxd3166xxx  synthesis. further
investigation will be required to clearly define the role of  xxxd228xxx  in maintaining intracellular  xxxd3166xxx .
in the context of other ascorbate-sensitive enzymes, the fact
that  xxxd228xxx  stimulates no synthesis is not particularly
surprising. the first step in no synthesis involves the hydroxylation of l-arginine to n-hydroxy-l-arginine (56), and several
enzymes that mediate amino acid hydroxylation are ascorbatesensitive (table i). in the first three instances,  xxxd228xxx 
acts through a reductive mechanism maintaining the iron cofactor in its reduced state for the hydroxylation of proline (57,
58), lysine (59, 60), and 4- xxxd40xxx  (61). in the
copper-containing enzymes dopamine ␤-hydroxylase and peptidylglycine monooxygenase,  xxxd228xxx  serves as a source of
electrons for reduction of molecular oxygen (62, 63). in contrast, the mechanism of ascorbate action with  xxxg2276xxx  is less clear. like the nos isoforms, this enzyme
utilizes  xxxd3166xxx  as a cofactor, and one suggested
mechanism of ascorbate action involves maintaining the pterin
in a reduced state (64). whether  xxxd228xxx  stimulates no
synthesis principally through facilitating l-arginine hydroxylation remains to be determined.
the effects of  xxxd228xxx  described here are physiologically
relevant based upon considerable experience with  xxxd228xxx 
and no bioactivity in human subjects. patients with atherosclerosis treated both acutely (25, 26) or chronically (26) with
oral  xxxd228xxx  demonstrate enhanced endothelium-derived
no bioactivity. in fact,  xxxd228xxx  improves endothelial no
bioactivity in a number of disease states including diabetes
mellitus (21), hypercholesterolemia (22), heart failure (65), and
hypertension (24). given the fundamental role of intracellular
 xxxd3166xxx  for no synthesis (46), the  xxxd3166xxx -dependent effect of ascorbic
acid described here provides an attractive explanation for such
uniform clinical observations.
in summary, the data presented here indicate that endothelial cell no bioactivity is sensitive to intracellular ascorbic
acid. in particular, endothelial cell production of no is enhanced by intracellular ascorbate, and this effect appears to be
mediated through an effect on intracellular  xxxd3166xxx . these data
suggest a novel mechanism for numerous in vivo observations
that endothelium-derived no bioactivity is enhanced by  xxxd228xxx .
