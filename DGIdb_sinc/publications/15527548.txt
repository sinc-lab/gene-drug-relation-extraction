abstract—the principal regulatory factors that control the flow and make-up of salivary secretion are
neurotransmitters, released by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation, that trigger activation
of g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) on the acinar cells of salivary glands and stimulate the
generation of soluble second messengers. in this study, we report that activation of gpcr by betaadrenergic agonist leading to stimulation in salivary mucin secretion occurs with the involvement
of  xxxg682xxx  (egfr). using [3 h]glucosamine-labeled mucous acinar cells
of sublingual salivary gland in culture, we show that stimulatory effect of beta-adrenergic agonist,
 xxxd2401xxx , on mucin secretion was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by egfr kinase
inhibitor, pd153035, as well as  xxxd3536xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg1751xxx . moreover, both inhibitors caused
the impedance in the acinar cell mucin secretory responses to beta-adrenergic agonist-generated second
messenger, camp, as well as adenylate cyclase activator,  xxxd1742xxx . the acinar cell secretory responses
to  xxxd2401xxx , furthermore, were blunted in a concentration-dependent fashion by  xxxd1307xxx , a selective
inhibitor of  xxxg2198xxx  src responsible for ligand-independent egfr autophosphorylation.
however, no significant alterations in the acinar cell mucin secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx ,
camp or  xxxd1742xxx  were attained with an inhibitor of the erk pathway,  xxxd1169xxx . our findings
underline the role of egfr as a convergence point in modulation of salivary mucin secretion triggered
by beta-adrenergic agonist gpcr activation and demonstrate the importance of src kinase in the egfr
transactivation process.
key words: salivary mucin secretion; beta-adrenergic g-protein-coupled receptor activation; egfr
transactivation; src kinase.

1. introduction

the epithelial surfaces of oral mucosa, soft gingival tissue and tooth enamel are
protected from a variety of exogenous and endogenous insults by copious quantities
of viscous secretion elaborated by the major and minor salivary glands (mandel,
1982; slomiany et al., 1993b; tabak, 1990). among the constituents of saliva
implicated in the preservation of the health of oral cavity are mucins. these
large, highly glycosylated glycoproteins play a major role in the maintenance
of viscoelastic properties of saliva, participate in the formation of the protective
coating covering tooth enamel and oral mucosa, and promote bacterial aggregation
and clearance from the oral cavity (slomiany et al., 1993b, 1996; tabak, 1990).
moreover, mucins of oral mucosal mucus coat, remaining in intimate association
with the epithelial surfaces within the oral cavity, provide important regulatory clues
that affect the processes occurring within the epithelial perimeter of oral mucosal
defense, such as receptor-gated ion channel activity regulation (slomiany et al.,
1993a, 1996).
the functional efficiency of salivary mucins depends on a delicate balance of
factors that control the processes of the glycoprotein assembly, post-translational
modification and secretion (cook et al., 1994; slomiany et al., 1997). under
normal physiological conditions, the factors’ synchrony plays an essential role in
maintenance the health of teeth and oral mucosa, whereas disturbances in salivary
gland acinar cell function affect the macromolecular composition and secretion of
saliva and often lead to the development of inflammation of oral mucosa, fungal
infection and periodontal disease (kaufman and lamster, 2002; mandel, 1982;
slomiany and slomiany, 2002a, b). hence, the factors regulating salivary mucin
elaboration are of direct relevance to the preservation of soft and hard oral tissue
homeostasis.
studies into the mechanism of salivary fluid and protein secretion provided welldocumented evidence that the control of salivary glands secretory responses is
mainly derived through sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation (anderson
et al., 1998; baum, 1987; cook et al., 1994). the parasympathetic nerve
stimulation induces mainly the secretion of salivary fluid low in proteins, while
sympathetic nerve stimulation evokes the secretion of saliva low in volume but rich
in macromolecular constituents (anderson et al., 1998; baum, 1987; slomiany
et al., 1992). indeed, an increase in flow rate of saliva with a low protein
concentration has been reported in response to cholinergic agonists, while the acinar
cells of submandibular gland respond to beta-adrenergic agonists with increase in
protein and mucin secretion (anderson et al., 1998; cook et al., 1994). this
apparent divergence in neurotransmitter action reflects the molecular mechanism
by which g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) mediate transmembrane signaling
leading to elevation in the intracellular levels of second messengers. thus, while
the secretion of salivary fluid is stimulated by activation of cholinergic and alphaadrenergic receptors coupled to gpcrs that regulate the generation of ca2+ and
pkc second messengers, the beta-adrenergic agonists that stimulate the secretion of

salivary mucin secretion in response to beta-adrenergic g-protein-coupled receptor activation 235

macromolecular constituents of saliva, including mucins, couple to gpcrs that
regulate the activation of adenylate cyclase and stimulate camp generation (baum,
1987; cook et al., 1994).
interestingly, the recent study revealed that the cellular effects of gpcr activation
mediated by camp generation occur in association with  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr) transactivation (bertelsen et al., 2004; maudsley et al., 2000).
this ligand-independent egfr activation involves selective phosphorylation of the
non-receptor tyrosine residues in the absence of egf ligand by gpcr-activated
src kinase (huang et al., 2004; hur et al., 2004; maudsley et al., 2000; shi and
kehrl, 2004). in this study, using mucin-producing acinar cells of rat sublingual
gland, we have investigated the role of egfr transactivation in regulation of the
signaling pathways leading to salivary mucin secretion in response to stimulation
by the beta-adrenergic agonist,  xxxd2401xxx .

2. materials and methods

2.1. sublingual gland acinar cell isolation and mucin labeling
the study was conducted with sprague–dawley rats in compliance with the
institutional animal care and use committee. freshly dissected sublingual salivary
glands were trimmed of fat and minced by passage through a 50 mesh metal
grid (slomiany et al., 1992). the minced tissue was suspended in 5 volumes
of dulbecco’s modified (gibco) eagle’s minimal essential medium (dmem),
supplemented with  xxxd164xxx  (50 µg/ml), penicillin (50 u/ml), streptomycin
(50 µg/ml) and 2% albumin, dispersed into single cells by trituration with a
glass homogenizer and settled by centrifugation (slomiany and slomiany, 2004).
following rinsing, the cells were resuspended in the medium to a concentration
of 5 × 105 cells/ml, transferred in 1-ml aliquots to dmem in culture dishes
containing [3 h]glucosamine (100 µci) and incubated for 4 h under 95% o2 /5%
co2 atmosphere at 37 ◦ c. the cells were then centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min,
washed three times with dmem containing 5% albumin to remove free radiolabel
and resuspended in fresh dmem free of albumin (slomiany and slomiany, 2004).
2.2. acinar cell incubation
to assess the effect of beta-adrenergic agonist on the sublingual salivary gland acinar
cells’ mucin secretory responses, the cells were preincubated for 30 min either with
saline diluent or indicated concentrations of beta-adrenergic antagonist,  xxxd123xxx 
(sigma) or cholinergic antagonist, atropine (sigma), followed by 30 min incubation
with 0–15 µm  xxxd2401xxx  (sigma). in the experiments on the effect of the egfr
inhibitor pd153035 (calbiochem),  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  (calbiochem),  xxxg1751xxx 
inhibitor  xxxd3536xxx  (sigma), src kinase inhibitor  xxxd1307xxx  (calbiochem), protein
kinase a (pka) inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  (sigma) and adenylate cyclase inhibitor sq22536

(sigma), prior to addition of the  xxxd2401xxx , the cells were first incubated for
30 min with the indicated concentration of the agent. the effects of dibutyryl-camp
(sigma) and  xxxd1742xxx  (sigma) were assessed following 30 min preincubation with
pd153035,  xxxd3536xxx ,  xxxd477xxx  or saline diluent. at the end of 30 min incubation
period, the cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min and washed three times
with fresh dmem. the medium and the washes were combined, and used for the
[3 h]glucosamine-labeled mucin assay (slomiany and slomiany, 2003).
2.3. cell viability
the acinar cell preparations before and during the experimentation were assessed
for viability and cellular integrity using trypan blue dye exclusion assay and the
determination of lactate dehydrogenase released into the medium (slomiany et al.,
1992).
2.4. mucin analysis
the combined cell wash and incubation medium containing 3 h-labeled mucin were
treated at 4 ◦ c with 10 volumes of 2% phosphotungstic acid in 20% trichloroacetic
acid for 4 h and the formed precipitates were collected by centrifugation. the
glycoprotein precipitates were dissolved in 6 m urea and chromatographed on
bio-gel a-1.5 column (0.9 × 100 cm). the eluted fractions were monitored
spectrophotometrically for protein and for radioactivity by liquid scintillation
spectrometry, and the mucin fractions eluted in the excluded volume were pooled,
dialyzed, lyophilized and subjected to analysis for total incorporation of radiolabel
and for protein content (slomiany and slomiany, 2003).
2.5. data analysis
all experiments were carried out using duplicate sampling and the results are
expressed as means ± sd. analysis of variance (anova) was used to determine
significance and the significance level was set at p < 0.05. the tests were
performed using soft stat statistica software. the protein content of samples was
measured using the bca protein assay kit (pierce).

3. results

the involvement of egfr transactivation in mediation of the signaling pathways
leading to salivary mucin secretion in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation was
investigated using [3 h]glucosamine-labeled mucous acinar cells of rat sublingual
salivary glands exposed to  xxxd2401xxx . under the employed incubation conditions, the cell viability remained over 97%, as judged by trypan blue uptake, and
the lactate dehydrogenase assays indicated only negligible, if any (0.5%), cellular damage. a concentration-dependent increase in mucin secretion was observed

stimulated for 30 min with the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2401xxx  (iso) and the medium was

with the  xxxd2401xxx  up to 10 µm, at which concentration a 3.4-fold increase in
mucin release over that of controls was attained (fig. 1a). the effect of  xxxd2401xxx  on mucin secretion was countered in a concentration-dependent fashion by
a specific beta-adrenergic antagonist,  xxxd123xxx , which at 30 µm produced a 94.1%
impedance of the  xxxd2401xxx  stimulatory effect (fig. 1b), the mucin prosecretory effect of  xxxd2401xxx , however, was not affected by cholinergic antagonist,
atropine (fig. 1b). this indicated that mucin secretion by sublingual salivary gland
acinar cells occurred in response to beta-adrenergic effector.
the stimulatory effect of  xxxd2401xxx  on mucin secretion by sublingual salivary gland acinar cells was subject to suppression by the pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of egfr kinase, pd153035, which at its optimal concentration of
100 nm evoked a 79.8% reduction in the  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated mucin secretion (fig. 2a). moreover, the stimulatory effect of  xxxd2401xxx  on mucin secretion was also inhibited by  xxxd1307xxx , a selective inhibitor of tyrosine src kinase responsible for ligand-independent egfr transactivation (fig. 2b). the effect of  xxxd1307xxx 
was concentration-dependent and at 15 µm produced a 74.3% reduction of the
 xxxd2401xxx -stimulated mucin secretion.
since the prosecretory effects of  xxxd2401xxx  are mediated through elevation
of intracellular levels of camp, we next assessed the acinar cell mucin secretory

responses to a cell-permeable analog of camp, dibutyryl-camp, and adenylate
cyclase activator,  xxxd1742xxx . the results revealed that both agents evoked a
concentration-dependent stimulation in mucin secretion, which with dibutyrylcamp at 100 µm increased by a 3.1-fold (fig. 3a) and with  xxxd1742xxx  at 20 µm
by a 2.9-fold (fig. 3b). further, the mucin prosecretory effect of  xxxd2401xxx  was
inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by a specific inhibitor of pka,  xxxd477xxx ,
which at 50 µm caused 60.2% reduction in mucin secretion (fig. 4a), as well as
by an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase activity, aq22536, which at 50 µm evoked a
48.1% reduction in mucin secretory response to  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 4b). moreover,
the pka inhibitor,  xxxd477xxx , also countered the mucin stimulatory effects of dibutyrylcamp and  xxxd1742xxx  (fig. 5). pretreatment with egfr kinase inhibitor, pd153035
reduced the stimulatory effect of dibutyryl-camp on the acinar cell mucin secretion
by a 69.8% and that of  xxxd1742xxx  by a 62.5% (fig. 5).
as the downstream effects of egfr activation are mediated by  xxxg1751xxx , we further examined the acinar cell mucin secretory responses in the presence of  xxxg1751xxx 
inhibitor,  xxxd3536xxx , which at the concentration of 100 nm employed herein is
well documented to be specific for  xxxg1751xxx  (bertelsen et al., 2004; djordjevic and
driscoll, 2002; stein and waterfield, 2000). the results revealed that pretreatment
with 100 nm  xxxd3536xxx  evoked an 89.6% reduction in the acinar cell mucin secretion induced by  xxxd2401xxx , the mucin secretory responses to a cell-permeable

concentrations of bdcamp (a) or  xxxd1742xxx  (b) and the medium was analyzed for radiolabeled mucin.

analog of camp, dibutyryl-camp, decreased by 85.1% and the prosecretory effects
of adenylate cyclase activator,  xxxd1742xxx , were reduced by 91.8% (fig. 6). however,
no significant alterations in the acinar cell mucin secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx , dibutyryl-camp or  xxxd1742xxx  were observed following pretreatment with
the highly specific inhibitor of erk pathway,  xxxd1169xxx  (fig. 7), which at the concentration used in this study (30 µm) has been shown to inhibit erk activation in
a variety of different systems (dudley et al., 1995; slomiany and slomiany, 2002b;
wilkie et al., 1996). this indicated that erk is not involved in mediation of the
 xxxd2401xxx  stimulatory effect on mucin secretion by sublingual salivary glands.

4. discussion

saliva, the product of anatomically and physiologically varied glands located in
the oral cavity, is known to exhibit considerable variation in its flow rate and
macromolecular composition with circadian rhythm and the nature and duration
of stimulus. the principal regulatory factors that control the flow and makeup
of salivary secretions are neurotransmitters, released by the parasympathetic and
sympathetic innervation, that bind specific gpcrs on the acinar cells of salivary
glands and trigger the elevation in intracellular levels of second messengers, ca2+ ,
pkc and camp (anderson et al., 1998; cook et al., 1994). the secretory responses
to ca2+ - and pkc-mediated cholinergic agonists are rapid in onset but transient and

hence account for variations in flow of saliva, those induced by camp-dependent betaadrenergic agonists are considerably more sustained in duration and rich in a variety
of proteins and glycoproteins, including mucins, that are of paramount significance
to the preservation of oral health (baum, 1987).
as the cellular responses mediated by gpcr signaling systems that rely on second
messenger camp generation occur in association with egfr  xxxg2198xxx 
activation, and since the activation of egfr through tyrosine phosphorylation has
been reported in response to beta-adrenergic agonists (bertelsen et al., 2004; huang et
al., 2004; maudsley et al., 2000), we examined the role of egfr transactivation in
regulation of salivary mucin secretion in response to stimulation by  xxxd2401xxx .
the results revealed that the exposure of mucin-producing acinar cells of sublingual
gland to  xxxd2401xxx  led to stimulation in mucin secretion and that the effect
was sensitive to inhibition by the beta-adrenergic antagonist  xxxd123xxx , but not to
the cholinergic antagonist atropine. hence, the observed mucin secretion by the
acinar cells occurred in response to beta-adrenergic effector. this interpretation of
the results is in keeping with our further findings demonstrating that the acinar
cell mucin secretory responses were stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonist-generated
second messenger, camp, as well as adenylate cyclase activator,  xxxd1742xxx , and
that the prosecretory effect of  xxxd2401xxx  on mucin secretion was subject to
suppression by a specific inhibitor of adenylate cyclase activity, sq22536, and the
pka inhibitor,  xxxd477xxx . more importantly, the prosecretory effect of  xxxd2401xxx 
on mucin secretion was inhibited by a specific inhibitor of egfr kinase activity,
pd153035, which at the concentrations employed in our study is well documented
to be specific for the egfr (fry et al., 1994; gardner et al., 2003; lee et al., 2001).
it is pertinent to note that pd153035 also caused the reduction in the acinar cell
mucin secretion in response to camp analog, dibutyryl-camp, and  xxxd1742xxx , thus
attesting to the role of egfr activation in mediation of  xxxd2401xxx  stimulatory
effect on salivary mucin secretion.
studies into the mechanism of egfr activation through ligand-independent
phosphorylation, referred to as transactivation, indicate that the receptor responds to
a variety of non-ligands by selective non-receptor tyrosine residues phosphorylation
(garner et al., 2003; shah et al., 2003; shi and kehrl, 2004). indeed, activation of
gpcr by camp-dependent beta-adrenergic agonists leading to egfr transactivation
with the involvement of pka-stimulation of erk and src kinases has been reported
in transformed kidney cells (mandsley et al., 2000), and colonic epithelial cells
respond to vip stimulation with gpcr-mediated signaling through c-amp, an
pka-dependent egfr transactivation that involves  xxxg1751xxx  (bertelsen et al., 2004).
the involvement of src kinase in egfr transactivation has also been demonstrated
to play a role in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling
cascades in response to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (garner
et al., 2003; shah et al., 2003). our findings with the acinar cells reported
herein revealed that  xxxd3536xxx , a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1751xxx , not only inhibited
the prosecretory effects of  xxxd2401xxx  on mucin secretion but also caused the

salivary mucin secretion in response to beta-adrenergic g-protein-coupled receptor activation 243

reduction in mucin secretory responses to beta-adrenergic agonist-generated second
messenger, camp, and adenylate cyclase activator,  xxxd1742xxx . based on the recent
data obtained with intestinal epithelial cells, the secretory responses to campdependent secretagogues require the recruitment of a  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx  regulatory subunit of
 xxxg1751xxx  to the egfr (bertelsen et al., 2004). this process, apparently, facilitates
autophosphorylation of tyrosine residue within the regulatory subunit and leads to
an increase in catalytic activity of the p110 subunit of  xxxg1751xxx  towards membrane
inositol lipids that trigger  xxxg118xxx   xxxg1890xxx /akt activation (haynes et al., 2003;
wang et al., 2003). interestingly, akt activation and  xxxg1751xxx -dependent generation
of phosphatidylinositol phosphates have been shown to be sensitive to an inhibitor
of src kinase,  xxxd1307xxx  (haynes et al., 2003).
indeed, investigations into the mechanism of gpcr-mediated transactivation of
the egfr clearly demonstrated the requirement of src kinase in the gpcr-induced
egfr phosphorylation (andreev et al., 2001; hur et al., 2004; maudsley et al.,
2000). while egfr is known to undergo autophosphorylation at five tyrosine
residues upon egf ligand stimulation, the phosphorylation sites that are dependent
on src kinase are different form those triggered by egf and involve tyr-845 and
tyr-1101 (hur et al., 2004; thomas and brugge, 1999). it has been reported that
phosphorylation of these two tyrosine residues is associated with egfr activation
through dimerization and triggers the formation of a heterocomplex between src and
activated egfr that results in an enhanced phosphorylation of receptor substrates
(hur et al., 2004; maudsley et al., 2000; thomas and brugge, 1999; tice et al.,
1999). furthermore, in many systems gpcr-mediated egfr transactivation is
associated with the activation of erk mapk and the src kinase inhibitors are
known to impair egfr autophosphorylation, as well as erk activation (kraus
et al., 2003; shah et al., 2003). hence, to gain further insight into the signaling
pathways that mediate salivary mucin secretory responses to gpcr agonists, we
examined the role of erk and src kinases. the results revealed that inhibition of
src kinase with a selective inhibitor,  xxxd1307xxx , at concentrations that has been shown to
inhibit src activation in several different systems (gardner et al., 2003; maudsley
et al., 2000; salazar and rozengurt, 1999), elicited a significant reduction in the
acinar cell mucin secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx . on the other hand, the
erk inhibitor,  xxxd1169xxx , which at the concentration used in our study has been
documented to inhibit erk activation in a variety of different systems (bertelsen
et al., 2004; dudley et al., 1995; slomiany and slomiany, 2002b; wilkie et al.,
1996), caused only marginal alteration in subsequent mucin secretory responses to
 xxxd2401xxx , as well as dibutyryl-camp and  xxxd1742xxx . interestingly, the recent
data obtained with intestinal cells suggest that, although camp-dependent agonistinduced egfr transactivation is accompanied by erk phosphorylation, the kinase
is not involved in mediation of camp-dependent secretory responses (bertelsen
et al., 2004). others have noted that erk activation is dependent on src kinase,
as well as egfr activation, depending on cell type, the type and duration of
the stimulus, and pointing to the fact that the characteristics of cells containing

244

overexpressed ectopic receptors and signaling proteins may differ from those of
cells expressing endogenous gpcrs (shah et al., 2003). it is also conceivable
that egfr has the capability to differentially modulate and propagate intracellular
signals of the camp-dependent secretory responses, or may reflect the differences
in the signaling events at the level of receptor activation.
in conclusion, the results of our study point to egfr as a convergence point
in modulation the extent of salivary mucin secretion triggered by beta-adrenergic
neurotransmitter gpcr activation and demonstrate the importance of src kinase
in the egfr transactivation process.
