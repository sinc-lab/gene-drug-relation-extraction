abstrart-the
inhibition of human lens  xxxg111xxx  by ravonoids has been studied. quercetin,
the major pentahydroxyflavone,
was observed to inhibit human lens  xxxg111xxx  by 50% at a
concentration of 5 x 10m6m. the inhibitory activity of its 30glucoside
was similar to that of the parent
aglycon. glycosidation with l-sugar (quercitrin and guaijaverin), however, inproved the inhibitory
activity (the 1~50values being 1 x 10m6m and 2.5 x 10m6m respectively). the improvement in inhibitory
activity with glycosidation with l-sugar was also apparent from the high inhibitory activity of myricitrin
as compared to  xxxd2680xxx , although the improvement in this case of hexahydroxy flavone glycosidation
was significantly less than in the case of penthahydroxy flavone glycosidation. the structure-activity
relationship observed for human lens enzyme was similar to that reported previously for rat lens enzyme.
inhibitory activity on the whole however, was lower with human lens enzyme. some known inhibitors
of cycle-oxygenase such as indomethacin, aspirin and  xxxd3259xxx  also inhibited human lens  xxxg111xxx .
thus. an inhibitor of one of the enzymes may actually inhibit both and. when administered. may exert
mixed physiological effects.

the genesis of sugar cataracts in experimental animals has been proposed to be initiated by aldose
reductase catalyzed synthesis of polyols [l] and a
concomitant osmotic hydration of the tissue [z], the
most convincing evidence of this hypothesis came
from studies where, in systemic and topical administration of  xxxg111xxx , inhibitors attenuated
the formation of cataracts in animals that were fed
excessive galactose or were rendered diabetic by
 xxxd3249xxx  and alloxon [3-61. more recent studies
point out a possible usefulness of  xxxg111xxx 
inhibitors in improving motor nerve conduction
velocity in humans with diabetes [7]. the inhibition
of  xxxg111xxx  has been achieved by various
classes of generic compounds such as isoquinolines,
xanthones, and chromonones. the largest number
of inhibitors has been discovered in the class of
chromones popularly known as bioflavonoids [s]. in
initial experiments the inhibitory activities of these
compounds were tested against rat lens  xxxg111xxx . it is, nevertheless, desirable that such compounds be examined for their efficacy against human
 xxxg111xxx  from various tissues. some studies
involving inhibition of human lens  xxxg111xxx 
at the enzyme level, as well as the organ culture
level, have appeared recently [9-111. such studies
are of pharmacokinetic and nutritional importance.
in this study, we have examined inhibition of purified
human lens  xxxg111xxx  by certain  xxxd3153xxx 
derivatives not reported before, such as glycosides
and  xxxd3258xxx . information has also been provided on the inhibition of human lens aldose reduc-

materials and methods

human lenses obtained from the maryland eye bank
within 4-6 hr after death were used for the enzyme
preparation. the entire preparation of the enzyme
was done in a cold room at 4”. lenses were homogenized in 1.5 voi. (six lenses in 9 ml) of 50mm
phosphate buffer, ph6.7, containing 10mm  xxxd26xxx . the homogenate was centrifuged at
12,000g for 15 min to obtain the soluble enzyme
fraction. the residue was re-extracted with one-third
volume of the same buffer (3 ml). the two supernatant fractions were pooled and recentrifuged. solid
(nh4)2soj was then added to the supernatant fraction to 25% saturation. after 15 min of equilibration,
the protein that was precipitated was removed by
centrifugation.
additional
(nh4)2s04 was then
added to the supernatant fraction to 60% saturation.
this resulted in the precipitation of the enzyme
activity. the precipitate thus obtained after centrifugation was dissolved in the minimum volume (3 ml)
of the above buffer.
gel filtration. the enzyme solution obtained as
described above (ca 160 mg protein) was applied to
a sephadex g-75 column (1.5 x x5cm) which had
been equiiibrated previously with 50 mm phosphate
buffer, ph 6.7, containing 10 mm  xxxd26xxx 
and 50 mm nacl. the enzyme was eluted from the
column with the same buffer in 2.5-ml fractions.
fractions with high enzyme activity were pooled and

p. s. chaudhrv el al

used for further
studies.
the fractions
collected
between 61 and 73 ml were most active.
enzyme activity was determined,
as described previously, by the rate of decrease in 0.d.1~0 due to
nadph utilization,
monitored
on a gilford 24002 recording
spectrophotometer
[8]. the reaction
mixture
consisted
of 2.5 x lo_‘m
nadph,
1.5 x lo-” m dl-glyceraldehyde,
in 0.1 m phosphate
buffer, ph 6.7. and the enzyme in a final volume of
1 ml. the reference blank consisted of all the above
components
except the substrate.
the effect of
inhibitors
on enzyme activity was determined
by
including in the mixture described
above the compound under study at the desired concentrations.
an
appropriate
blank to correct for absorption
by the
compounds
was also run simultaneously.
the compounds were dissolved in water with the aid of a
minimum amount of sodium hydroxide which maintained the ph between 7 and 8. indomethacin
was
dissolved in a minimum acount of ethanol.
during (nhj)$o,
fractionation
and gel filtration,
the activities of the fractions were monitored
in the
presence of 0.5 m lithium sulfate. protein was determined according to lowry et al. [12], using bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as the standard.

the
elution pattern of  xxxg111xxx  through sephadex g-75 is shown in fig. 1. the enzyme activity

at least for 6 days at 4”. thus, the preparation

with this preparation,
no
addition of lithium sulfate (often added to activate
the enzyme if its specific activity is low) was required.

response of the enzyme toward some inhibitors more
strongly than others. the inhibition of  xxxg111xxx  by indomethacin,  xxxd3259xxx  and its active metabolite ( xxxd3260xxx ), which are commonly used
anti-rheumatic drugs, was also studied. the 1~50values for  xxxd3259xxx 
and  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide were
0.4 x 10t6and 0.8 x low6 m respectively. the values
are somewhat higher than those reported recently
with crude lens enzyme [lo].
we discovered previously that flavonoids are
potent inhibitors of rat lens  xxxg111xxx  [13].
the main objective of the present investigation was
to study the effect of some flavonoids on human lens
 xxxg111xxx . the 1~50of quercetin, the basic
compound in this group, was 5 x 10m6m. the icky

previous studies conducted with the crude rat lens
