objective:  xxxd2654xxx , a rapid- and short-acting insulinotropic sulfonylurea
receptor ligand, exhibits hypoglycemic action unlike other sulfonylureas.
the efficacy of the combination of  xxxd2654xxx  and a-glucosidase inhibitors
for diabetic patients on hemodialysis (hd) has not been prospectively evaluated; therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2654xxx  in
these patients.
research design and methods: we performed an open-label randomized
study with 36 type 2 diabetics with poor glycemic control on hd and receiving
daily doses of  xxxd3524xxx  (0.9 mg). the patients were randomly assigned to two
groups: a combination-therapy group ( xxxd2654xxx  group),  xxxd2654xxx  initial
dose 7.5 – 15 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and constant daily dose 0.9 mg of
 xxxd3524xxx , and a monotherapy group (control group), constant daily dose
0.9 mg of  xxxd3524xxx  alone. the efficacy of the treatment was determined by
monitoring plasma glucose, hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), and glycated albumin
(ga) levels and using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(homa-ir). safety and tolerance were determined by monitoring clinical
and laboratory parameters.
results: the final dose of  xxxd2654xxx  was 22.9 ± 8.9 (mean ± s.d.) mg
(0.41 mg/kg) daily.  xxxd2654xxx  reduced fasting plasma glucose and ga levels
after 4 weeks and hba1c levels after 8 weeks. triglyceride levels and homa-ir
values also decreased significantly after  xxxd2654xxx  treatment. no significant changes in blood pressure levels or serious adverse effects such as
hypoglycemia or liver impairment were observed.
conclusions: this study suggests a combination therapy of  xxxd2654xxx  and
 xxxd3524xxx  may have potential for the treatment of diabetics on hd. due to the
small sample size used, further studies should be performed, particularly to
assess the safety of  xxxd2654xxx  treatment.

introduction

the number of patients with primary diabetic nephropathy undergoing dialysis
continues to increase. the prognosis for diabetic patients undergoing dialysis is
worse than that for patients with primary glomerular nephropathy. diabetic patients
undergoing dialysis also have an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and

complicated disease courses. recent clinical evidence has
suggested favorable effects of strict glycemic control on cardiovascular disease, which is the main cause of death in
diabetic patients [1,2]. thus, good glycemic control can
decrease cardiovascular and other diabetes-related causes of
death, leading to better survival rates in diabetic patients [3-5].
numerous drugs with different mechanisms of action are
being used with the aim of improving glycemic control.
multiple drugs with different pharmacological profiles are
used for the management of type 2 diabetics. therapeutic
alternatives in patients with type 2 diabetes and end stage
kidney disease are limited because a reduced glomerular
filtration rate results in the accumulation of some drugs
and/or their metabolites [6]. conventional oral hypoglycemic
agents, such as sulfonylureas (su), are not suitable due to the
risk of prolonged hypoglycemia; furthermore, metformin is
contraindicated. clinicians can treat diabetic hemodialysis
(hd) patients by orally administering a-glucosidase inhibitors (a-gi). therefore, insulin injection therapy remains the
mainstay treatment to achieve good glycemic control in
diabetic patients receiving hd therapy.
 xxxd2654xxx  is a rapid- and short-acting insulinotropic su
receptor ligand (surl), a benzylsuccinic acid derivative developed in japan that has rapid hypoglycemic action unlike
conventional su agents [7-9]. it alleviates postprandial hyperglycemia and improves glycemic control [8]. because the
concentration of  xxxd2654xxx  in blood rapidly increases after
oral administration and the drug quickly disappears subsequently, it is unlikely that this drug will exert hypoglycemic
effects early in the morning and between meals. therefore, as
 xxxd2654xxx  is rarely accompanied by hypoglycemia, it would
be an attractive therapeutic option for patients with impaired
kidney function.  xxxd2654xxx  administration in patients undergoing hd remains to be adequately studied, but clinical trials
have been conducted in diabetic patients with relatively
normal kidney function [10-12]. in light of this information,
we decided to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2654xxx  in
japanese diabetics on hd. no prospective study has evaluated
the use of  xxxd2654xxx  in combination with a-gi in diabetics
on hd. thus,  xxxd2654xxx  may become the drug of choice for
diabetics on hd if its safety and efficacy can be confirmed.

patients and methods

patients
we performed an open-label, randomized and controlled trial.
the study was performed in the hd clinic of the nihon
university nerima hikarigaoka hospital, japan, with the
approval of the clinical research ethical committee of the
same institution. we enrolled type 2 diabetics undergoing hd
therapy in our dialysis unit; all patients had poor glycemic
control and were not treated with insulin. poor glycemic
control was defined as a hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) level exceeding 6.5% after 8 consecutive weeks of daily administration of
0.9 mg of  xxxd3524xxx , an a-gi. exclusion criteria were deranged
2.1

liver function at baseline, decompensated congestive heart
failure, infectious disease, thyroid disease, malignant tumor
and treatment with steroids.
we recruited 36 (male/female: 22/14) type 2 diabetics on
chronic hd therapy with poor glycemic control who met the
enrollment criteria: hba1c levels exceeding 6.5% after 8 weeks
on oral  xxxd3524xxx  therapy of 0.9 mg daily (observation period).
written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
all of the patients had anuria. the mean age of the patients
was 66.6 ± 9.0 (mean ± s.d.) years and the mean duration of
hd was 25.8 ± 8.2 (mean ± s.d.) months. all the patients
were diagnosed with primary renal diagnosis of diabetic
nephropathy caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was
diagnosed by renal biopsy or clinical history. patient
characteristics are listed in table 1.
design
after initial evaluations, we randomly assigned 18 hd
patients to an add-on therapy with  xxxd2654xxx  ( xxxd2654xxx 
group), and 18 hd patients continued with  xxxd3524xxx  monotherapy (control group) (figure 1). a computer-generated list
was used for randomization. patients of the  xxxd2654xxx  group
started with 5 mg  xxxd2654xxx  three times a day orally (t.i.d.
p.o.) before each meal. this dose was increased up to 10 mg t.i.
d. if target hba1c values < 6.5% were not reached after
12 weeks. elderly hd patients (> 75 years of age) initially
received 2.5 mg t.i.d. p.o. the dose was escalated to 5 mg t.i.d.
p.o. at week 12, if necessary.  xxxd3524xxx  dose was reduced from
0.9 to 0.6 mg daily if necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. on the
other hand, if the physician judged that  xxxd2654xxx  5 mg t.i.d.
presented a safety problem, its dose could be reduced to
2.5 mg t.i.d. or 2.5 mg two times a day in elderly patients.
hypoglycemia was defined as a fasting or random blood
glucose level of < 70 mg/dl or the presence of typical symptoms
at the fasting stage. patients continued to receive their regular
medications during the study period (e.g., antihypertensives,
recombinant human erythropoietin (epo), phosphate binders
and lipid-lowering agents). the target predialysis systolic and
diastolic blood pressure was 140/90 mmhg.
hba1c, glycated albumin (ga) and plasma glucose levels
were measured as the criteria for glycemic control. insulin
resistance was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (homa-ir), in which homair = fasting glucose (mg/dl)  fasting insulin (µiu/ml)/405.
the concentration of plasma insulin was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. levels of hb, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase,  xxxg941xxx , lactate dehydrogenase,
alkaline phosphatase, g-gtp, total cholesterol (t-chol), highdensity lipoprotein (hdl) and triglycerides (tgs) were
routinely measured following clinical chemistry procedures
using commercial kits. the body weight of patients before and
after dialysis, body mass index (bmi), cardiothoracic ratio
(ctr) determined by radiographic examination of the chest,
and the levels of pre-dialysis systolic and diastolic blood
pressures were also measured. fasting blood samples were

hd procedure
in all patients, the hd procedure was performed for 4 h at a
blood flowrate of 200 ml/min and a dialysate flowrate of
500 ml/min. hd was performed using dialyzers containing
high-flux membranes such as polysulfone, polyester-polymer
alloy or cellulose triacetate. the surface area of the dialyzer
membrane was selected according to the body weight of the
patient. the glucose concentrations of the dialysate were
100 mg/dl. heparin was used at 2600 – 4000 units per
4 h hd session for anticoagulation. the volume of ultrafiltration was maintained on the basis of clinical dry weight
during each session.

obtained before commencing the hd treatment. all parameters for monitoring  xxxd2654xxx  effects were evaluated once
monthly during the 8-week period before the commencement
of  xxxd2654xxx  treatment and once monthly during the
24-week treatment period.

baseline characteristics
the demographic characteristics at baseline (age distribution,
sex distribution, plasma albumin and duration of dialysis)
were similar between the  xxxd2654xxx  and control groups after
randomization (table 1).  xxxd3524xxx  (0.9 mg) was administered
daily to all the patients. both the groups received similar doses
of lipid-lowering agents (statins) and renin-angiotensin system
blockers. the two groups also had similar metabolic control,
as reflected by baseline lipid levels, dry weight, homa-ir,
anemia state and blood pressure level (table 2).
3.1

dosage of  xxxd2654xxx  and  xxxd3524xxx 
the final dose of  xxxd2654xxx  was 22.9 ± 8.5 mg daily, and
it was 0.41 ± 0.14 mg/kg/day. patients in both groups
received a daily dose of 0.9 mg  xxxd3524xxx . dose reduction
of  xxxd3524xxx  was not required because none of the patients
developed hypoglycemia.

safety variables

at each visit, the subjects were questioned about compliance
(diet and medication), concomitant medication and adverse
events. safety assessments were performed repeatedly throughout the study. adverse events were graded on the basis of
intensity (mild, moderate and severe). serious adverse events
were defined as significant and untoward medical events that
resulted in death, hospitalization, or significant disability or
incapacity. patient withdrawal from the study was considered
if an allergy or intolerance to  xxxd2654xxx  appeared during the
study, or if either the serum transaminase concentration
increased to more than twice the upper limit of the normal
range and the patient concomitantly exhibited symptoms such
as loss of appetite or general fatigue, or if the patient was

glycemic control
as shown in figure 2, there was a significant decrease in fasting
plasma glucose level in the  xxxd2654xxx  group at 4 weeks after
the start of  xxxd2654xxx  therapy, and the levels continued to
decrease throughout the 24-week treatment period. the
decrease in the fasting plasma glucose levels was greater in
the  xxxd2654xxx  group than in the control group at 8 weeks,
and the levels continued to decrease throughout the 24-week

insulinotropic surl with rapid hypoglycemic action [7-9]. it
alleviates postprandial hyperglycemia and, as a result,
improves overall glycemic control [13]. the blood concentration of  xxxd2654xxx  rapidly increases after oral administration
and the drug quickly disappears subsequently; therefore, the
drug is unlikely to exert hypoglycemic effects early in the
morning and between meals. in addition to  xxxd2654xxx , two
other insulinotropic surls,  xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx , are in
clinical use; however,  xxxd2654xxx  shows selective action on the
atp-sensitive  xxxg1232xxx  ( xxxg1250xxx /surl) of pancreatic
b-cells and the order of affinity to  xxxg1250xxx /syr1 is  xxxd2654xxx 
>  xxxd3098xxx  >  xxxd2702xxx  [14]. these results suggest that
 xxxd2654xxx  induces insulin secretion by specifically acting
on pancreatic b-cells and has few unwanted effects on the
cardiovascular system. because  xxxd2654xxx  is rarely accompanied by hypoglycemia, it may be an attractive therapeutic
option for patients undergoing dialysis.
however, none of the earlier studies have evaluated the
efficacy of  xxxd2654xxx  in combination with a-gi agents for
uremic patients on dialysis. therefore, we decided to compare
the effects of  xxxd3524xxx  monotherapy with the effects of an
add-on therapy,  xxxd2654xxx  combined with  xxxd3524xxx , in hd
patients with type 2 diabetes. the ratio of type 2 diabetes to
type 1 diabetes in japan is larger than that in the us or europe,
and japanese diabetics have a lower bmi than diabetics in the
west [15]. moreover, a-gi has been speculated to be more
effective for japanese diabetics, because the japanese have
historically subsisted primarily on carbohydrates [16]. in the
light of this assumption, the recent westernization and the
increasing frequency of insulin resistance in japan may be
mitigating the a-gi responsiveness in the japanese population. the mean bmi in our japanese type 2 diabetic hd
patients was 22.2 kg/m2 and only two patients had bmis
> 24 kg/m2. our results suggest that  xxxd3524xxx  is effective for
174

maintaining the present glycemic state, because it neither
worsened nor improved glycemic control in patients with
poor glycemic control, which was defined by hba1c
> 6.5%. thus, we showed that the add-on therapy of  xxxd2654xxx  with  xxxd3524xxx  may be a therapeutic option for achieving
good glycemic control in type 2 diabetic hd patients with
otherwise poor glycemic control. the  xxxd2654xxx  dosage in
our study was lower than that for subjects with normal kidney
function. therefore, the daily dose of  xxxd2654xxx  (23 mg) was
adequate: in fact, the dose was adequate to induce significant
reductions in glycemic parameters such as fasting plasma
glucose, hba1c, ga and homa-ir levels. in our study,
we noted that  xxxd2654xxx  significantly improved glycemic
control, tg level and interdialytic weight gain even when
it was administered only for a short duration. therefore, we
believe that this agent may be beneficial for diabetic patients
on hd. our study is limited by the relatively small sample size
and the short period of treatment. moreover, to further clarify
the effect and safety of  xxxd2654xxx  and the differences related
to factors such as gender, age and bmi in the hd population,
further longitudinal clinical trials should be conducted in a
larger number of patients.
as stated in the 2007 kidney disease outcomes quality
initiative guidelines, the target hba1c level associated with the
best clinical outcome in diabetic hd patients has not been
established yet [17]. anemia, which results from a short
erythrocyte life span, theoretically suppresses hba1c levels.
therefore, some studies suggested that the hba1c level is not
an ideal index for assessing glycemic control in the diabetic
hd patients who receive epo [18-20]. by increasing the
proportion of young erythrocytes in the blood, both anemia
and epo can falsely lower the hba1c level, thereby, leading
to failure in the diagnosis of hyperglycemia. in contrast, the
ga level was reported to provide a significantly superior

estimation of glycemic control in diabetic hd patients [18-20].
the ga level was not significantly associated with dialysis,
hemoglobin level or epo dose in dialysis patients.
therefore, ga, which is unaffected by the changes in the
survival time of erythrocytes, has been suggested as a better
indicator of glycemic control. because the ga level reflects
glycemic control for only 1 – 2 weeks preceding the assay, the
ga level as well as the fasting plasma glucose levels in the
 xxxd2654xxx  group decreased from 4 weeks, which was earlier
than the reduction in the hba1c level. however, there is no
clear consensus on the target hba1c and ga levels for a good
prognosis of diabetic hd patients. this aspect will have to be
clarified by long-term future studies.

conclusion

in conclusion, we found that combination therapy of
 xxxd2654xxx  with  xxxd3524xxx  is effective for the treatment of

diabetics on hd. thus,  xxxd2654xxx  can be used as one of the
therapeutic options for glycemic control in uremic type 2
diabetics. the optimal daily dose of  xxxd2654xxx  is suggested to
be lower in the diabetic hd patients than that in the diabetic
patients with normal kidney function.  xxxd2654xxx  has the
potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on hd who
ultimately require insulin injection therapy. further investigations will be needed to assess the efficacy of combination
therapy of  xxxd2654xxx  with not only  xxxd3524xxx  but also
thiazolidinediones or insulin injection therapy.
