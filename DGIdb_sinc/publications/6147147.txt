binding of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists to rat and rabbit lung: special reference to  xxxd2467xxx .  binding of 3h-dihydroalprenolol (3h-dha) to beta-adrenoceptors in homogenates from rat and rabbit lung was homogeneous and of high affinity (kd = 0.6 and 1.1 nmol/l at 20 degrees c; 1.1 and 2.2 nmol/l at 37 degrees c). the beta 1-selective antagonists betaxolol, metoprolol,  xxxd329xxx  and  xxxd58xxx  displaced 3h-dha in a biphasic manner. from these data, the beta-adrenoceptor subtype distribution in rat lung homogenates was estimated to be 80% beta 2 (at 20 and 37 degrees c) as compared to 25% beta 2 in rabbit lung homogenates. in general, binding of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (selective and nonselective) was slightly (less than 2 x) weaker in rabbit than in rat lung homogenates. in rat lung, binding of cardioselective beta-blockers to beta 1-receptors seemed to be more temperature-sensitive than binding to beta 2-receptors or binding of nonselective beta-blockers.  xxxd2467xxx , a potent non-cardioselective beta-blocker in pharmacological experiments, displaced 3h-dha in a homogeneous manner (indicative of non-selectivity). in rat lung homogenates kd values were 0.8 nmol/l at 20 degrees c and 2.1 nmol/l at 37 degrees c. similar values were found for the metabolites dihydrolevobunolol and hydroxylevobunolol. surprisingly, d-bunolol, the dextrarotatory enantiomer of bunolol, showed a biphasic displacement curve, the fraction of high affinity sites being 83% in rat lung homogenates and 23% in rabbit lung. this ratio of sites is expected for a beta 2-adrenoceptor preferring ligand. high affinity binding (i.e. supposedly binding to beta 2-receptors) was about 50 times weaker than binding of  xxxd2467xxx , in agreement with known stereospecificity of beta-adrenoceptor binding.
