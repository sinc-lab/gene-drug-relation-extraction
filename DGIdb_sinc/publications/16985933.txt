 xxxg930xxx  antagonist in the management of prostate cancer.   xxxd2226xxx  ( xxxg930xxx ) agonist therapy to induce medical castration has become the most common form of hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. when treatment is started,  xxxg930xxx  agonists initially stimulate the release of lh, causing a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a "flare" phenomenon or worsening of disease, particularly in patients with bone metastatic disease.  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) receptor antagonism represents a newer approach to medical castration.  xxxd51xxx  is a pure  xxxg931xxx  antagonist that is devoid of any  xxxg930xxx  agonist activity. results from 1 phase ii and 3 phase iii clinical trials demonstrate that  xxxd51xxx  produces medical castration more quickly and without causing testosterone surge, as compared with  xxxg930xxx  agonists with or without a nonsteroidal antagonist. the safety profile in terms of adverse events is comparable between the 2 types of treatment, but the lack of testosterone surge with  xxxd51xxx  might confer a safety advantage by abolishing the risk of a disease flare.
