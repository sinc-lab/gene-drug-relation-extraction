abstract

purpose:the purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects of physiologic levels (10-50
nmol/l) of 2- xxxd3206xxx  (2me) on the growth of  xxxg730xxx  (er) ^ positive breast
cancer cells and provide insights into its mechanism(s) of action.
experimental design: using the era-positive breast cancer cells, we studied the effects of
2me on cell proliferation and cell signaling. our hypothesis is that 17h-estradiol (e2) and 2me
can affect shared cell signaling pathways, leading to different outcomes in cell proliferation,
depending on the absence/presence of e2.
results: e2 stimulated the growth of mcf-7 andt-47 d cells and induced akt phosphorylation, a
nongenomic signaling pathway. in the absence of e2, 10 to 50 nmol/l of 2me enhanced cell
growth and akt phosphorylation. however, in the presence of e2, 2me inhibited e2-induced cell
growth and prevented e2-induced akt phosphorylation. confocal microscopic studies showed
that 2me inhibited subcellular distribution of era in response to e2 in mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cells.
2me also down-regulated e2-induced increases in  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxg1626xxx  activity.
in addition, treatment of mcf-7 cells with 2me in the presence of e2 resulted in a decrease in era
level by 72 hours. accelerated down-regulation of era may contribute to growth inhibition in the
presence of e2/2me combinations. in contrast, a concentration of up to 2.5 amol/l 2me had no
effect on the growth of er-negative sk-br-3 cells, either in the presence or absence of e2.
conclusions: our results provide evidence for the nongenomic action of 2me in er-positive
cells. in the presence of e2, 2me suppressed e2-induced cell growth, akt signaling, and generation of  xxxd1773xxx , whereas it acted as an estrogen in the absence of e2. the intriguing growthstimulatory and growth-inhibitory effects of 2me on breast cancer cells suggests the need for its
selective use in patients.

17h-estradiol (e2), estrone (e1), and some of its biologically
active metabolites not only regulate the physiology of the
mammary glands, but also affect the development of breast
cancer. enzymes involved in multiple pathways of biosynthesis
and the metabolism of endogenous estrogens contribute to
the etiology of human breast cancer (1, 2). distinct metabolic

pathways are responsible for conversion of e2 or e1 to derivatives hydroxylated at the c-2 or c-4 positions (catechol estrogens) or to the 16a position (16a-hydroxy-e1; refs. 3, 4). catechol
estrogens are further converted to methoxyestrogens by  xxxg487xxx  – mediated methylation. increased
production of 2- xxxd3206xxx  (2me) compared with 16ahydroxy-e1 has been linked to lower breast cancer risk in humans
(5). consequently, 2me has been widely viewed as a ‘‘good
estrogen,’’ exerting growth-inhibitory effects on breast cancer (4).
although serum concentrations of 2me (25-55 pg/ml) in women
are comparable to that of e2 (40-80 pg/ml), as much as 4,000 pg/
ml of 2me has been reported in pregnant women (6).
studies on the pharmacologic concentrations (1-10 amol/l)
of  xxxd26xxx  have revealed its antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in
preclinical cancer models (7 – 12). 2me seems to have increased
sensitivity toward rapidly proliferating cancer cells compared
with normal cells (13). antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of
2me have led to phase i and phase ii clinical trials with
promising beneficial effects (7, 11). several mechanism(s),
including tubulin depolymerization, up-regulation of p53, upregulation of death receptor, production of reactive oxygen
species, and inhibition of superoxide dismutase have been
proposed for its action (7 – 12). however, pathways such
as inhibition of superoxide dismutase remain controversial
(14, 15). dose-dependent mechanistic differences, such as g1

cell signaling by 17b-estradiol and 2- xxxd3206xxx 

arrest or g2-m arrest of cancer cells have also been observed with
2me (16). overall, widely different effects of 2me do not provide
a common pathway or a framework for the action of the
compound. in contrast to its antitumor effects, recent studies
also indicate that 2me could act as an  xxxg730xxx  (er)
agonist, stimulating the growth of er-positive breast tumors
(8, 17). this result has fueled a controversy on the ‘‘potential and
suitability’’ of 2me in cancer therapy (18).
the hormonal responses of estrogens are generally mediated
by era and erh, the ligand activated transcription factors that
facilitate cell cycle progression and cell proliferation (19). the
classical mechanism of action of estrogens is described by
ligand-induced conformational changes of ers, followed by
dimerization and increased binding to regulatory regions of
estrogen responsive genes. however, recent studies indicate that
this classical paradigm of estrogenic action is incomplete and
that estrogenic action might involve both genomic and nongenomic components (20, 21). the nongenomic action of e2
involves its interaction with membrane er, followed by the
activation of kinase cascades, either through g proteins or
through the coupling of er with growth factor receptor
pathways (20 – 24). it is possible that the interaction of estrogens
with the membrane ers may not follow the predictions of
binding affinity measurements. although human era and erh
have low binding affinities for 2me compared with e2, 2me
seems to have antiestrogenic effects on mcf-7 cells (8, 12, 25).
in the present study, we examined the effect of 10 to 50
nmol/l 2me on several cell signaling variables in er-positive
mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cell lines. for comparison, we also tested the
sensitivity of 2me on an er-negative cell line, sk-br-3 (22). as
indicators of nongenomic signaling, we examined the effect of
2me on akt signaling and  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) production.
previous studies have reported akt phosphorylation and
increases in the levels of camp in response to e2 treatment of
breast cancer cells (26 – 28). as markers of cell proliferation, we
examined the effect of 2me on the activity of ornithine
decarboxylase (odc) and increases in polyamine levels. odc
gene expression and enzyme activity are increased by growthstimulatory hormones, carcinogens, and tumor promoters
(29 – 31). odc converts ornithine to putrescine, which is then
converted to spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx . these polyamines
regulate macromolecular functions by virtue of their binding
to negatively charged sites, in addition to binding to specific
sites in nucleic acids and proteins (29 – 31). increases in odc
and polyamine levels are associated with estrogenic action in
breast cancer cells (32, 33).
our results show that 2me induced akt phosphorylation in
both mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cells in the absence of e2, suggesting its
estrogenic activity. however, in the presence of e2, 2me
inhibited akt phosphorylation in these cells. confocal microscopic studies showed that the e2-induced pattern of subcellular distribution of era in both cell lines is disrupted by 2me.
furthermore, 2me did not have any significant effect on the
growth of sk-br-3 cells  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l to 2.5 amol/l
concentrations, either in the presence or absence of e2.

materials and methods
materials. mcf-7, t- xxxd751xxx , and sk-br-3 cell lines were obtained
from american type culture collection (manassas, va). e2 and 2me
were purchased from steraloids, inc. (wilton, nh). 2me was further

purified by a high-pressure liquid chromatography method (34). the
high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis (with uv detection) of
the repurified 2me showed a purity of >99%, and no e2, e1, or other
metabolite was detected. in addition, gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy analysis of the trimethylsilylated derivatives of the purified
2me confirmed the structural identity of 2me and the absence of e2, e1,
or any of the estrogen metabolites/derivatives, after comparing against a
library of >60 estrogen derivatives (34). putrescine, spermidine,
 xxxd3234xxx , dmem, phenol red – free dmem, fetal bovine serum,
and anti-h-actin antibody were obtained from sigma chemical co.
(st. louis, mo). antibiotics, trypsin, and other additives for cell culture
medium were purchased from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). antiphospho-akt and anti-akt antibodies were from cell signaling
technology (beverly, ma). anti-era antibody was from santa cruz
biotechnology, (santa cruz, ca). the ere-linked firefly luciferase
reporter gene containing four tandem repeats of 38-mer consensus ere
in  xxxg2041xxx  plasmid (35, 36) was kindly provided by dr. carolyn m.
klinge of university of kentucky. renilla luciferase plasmid,  xxxg2041xxx 
control plasmid, and dual luciferase assay system were purchased from
promega, madison, wi.
cell culture. mcf-7 cells were maintained in dmem containing
10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin,
100 ag/ml streptomycin, 40 ag/ml gentamicin, 2 ag/ml insulin, 0.5
mmol/l sodium pyruvate, 10 mmol/l nonessential amino acids, and 2
mmol/l l-glutamine. sk-br-3 cells were maintained in mccoy 5a
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/l
glutamine. t- xxxd751xxx  cells were maintained in rpmi 1640 with serum and
antibiotic supplements. all cell lines were grown in phenol red – free
dmem for 7 days prior to experiments (12, 33). this medium
contained 10% fetal bovine serum pretreated with dextran-coated
charcoal (0.5% norit a and 0.05% dextran t-70) to avoid the effects of
serum-derived estrogenic compounds.
cell proliferation. mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cells were seeded in triplicates
at a density of 5  104 cells/ml/well in 24-well plates. sk-br-3 cells
were seeded at a density of 3  104 cells/ml/well. cells were dosed 24
hours after plating, with required concentrations of e2 and/or 2me.
cells were re-dosed at 48-hour intervals. after the appropriate treatment
periods, live cells were counted using the trypan blue exclusion method,
using a hemocytometer.
western blot analysis. cells (2.5  106/100 mm dish) were washed
twice with ice-cold pbs and lysed with the addition of ice-cold lysis
buffer [150 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 150 mmol/l nacl, 1% nonidet
p-40, 2 mmol/l edta, 50 mmol/l sodium fluoride, 0.2% sds, 1
mmol/l sodium vanadate, and 1 concentration of a protease inhibitor
cocktail (calbiochem, san diego, ca)]. thirty micrograms of protein
(determined by the bradford protein assay) was diluted in 2 sdspage laemmli buffer [150 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 6.8), 30% glycerol,
4% sds, 7.5 mmol/l dtt, 0.01% bromophenol blue] and separated on
a 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride polyscreen membrane. after blocking with 5% nonfat
milk, membrane was immunoblotted with a 1:100 dilution of the
primary antibody. protein bands were visualized using horseradish
peroxidase – conjugated secondary antibody with a chemiluminescence
based detection system. to verify equal protein loading, membranes
were stripped and reblotted with anti-h-actin monoclonal antibody.
the blots were developed using kodak xar biomax film. lightly
exposed films were scanned using an epson b4 scanner and band
intensities quantified using the nih image j 1.34s program.
confocal microscopic analysis of era. mcf-7 or t-47 d cells were
seeded 5  104 cells/well in labtek four-well slide chamber. after
treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at
22jc, rinsed with pbs, permeabilized with 0.1% triton for 5 minutes.
cells were then blocked in normal goat serum (5%) in pbs followed by
incubation with anti-era antibody, and diluted in 2.5% normal goat
serum in pbs for 2 hours. cells were rinsed with pbs and incubated
with secondary antibody for 1 hour at 22jc. cells were then rinsed
with pbs and actin was stained by a 2.5% solution of alexa 546

conjugated to phalloidin in pbs for 20 minutes. nuclei were stained
with 4v,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (f1 nmol/l) solution for 5
minutes. primary antibody was rabbit-anti-era (sc-7207, santa cruz
biotechnology) at 1:100 dilution (24). antirabbit secondary antibody
conjugated to alexa 488 (green; molecular probes/invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca) was used to detect era. images were recorded using a zeiss 510
laser scanning microscope with a 60 objective at identical intensity
settings for all treatment groups. to evaluate nonspecific binding, cells
were examined after treatment with fluorescence-labeled secondary
antibody alone. no fluorescence was detected in this case.
measurement of camp. mcf-7 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 
106 cells/100 mm dish. after 24 hours, cells were pretreated with 1
mmol/l  xxxd2388xxx  for 30 minutes and then treated
with different concentrations of e2, 2me, or their combination. cells
were harvested in 500 al of 0.1 n hcl and camp measured according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (biomol, plymouth, pa). camp
values were normalized against protein levels determined by the
bradford assay.
odc activity assay. mcf-7 cells (3  106 cells/dish) were plated in
100 mm dishes. cells were treated with 10 nmol/l e2, 2me, or their
combination in triplicate. the odc assay was done as described
previously (30, 33). briefly, cell pellets were sonicated on ice for 10
seconds in 1 ml of  xxxd3449xxx  [10 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 2.5
mmol/l dtt]. after centrifugation, supernatant was used for the
assay. ornithine mix containing 6.5 aci/ml of 14c-ornithine and 22
mmol/l unlabeled ornithine in 10 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 7.4) and
pyridoxal-5-phosphate (2 mmol/l) were added to tubes fitted with
rubber stoppers with center wells (kontess glass company, vineland,
nj). hyamine hydroxide was used to trap 14co2 and radioactivity
determined using a scintillation counter. odc activity was calculated
as nmol/mg protein/h.
polyamine assay. polyamine levels were quantified by a previously
described procedure using a hitachi l-7000 high-pressure liquid
chromatography unit (30). mcf-7 cells were plated at a density of
3  106 cells/100 mm dish, treated with e2 or 2me for 24 or 48 hours.
cells were homogenized in 8% sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged.
polyamines were converted to dansyl derivatives and separated on a
c18 analytic column with an acetonitrile-water gradient, and quantified
by a fluorescence detector. 1,6-diaminohexane was used as the internal
standard.
transient transfections. cells (1.75  105) were seeded in 24-well
plates. after 16 hours, cells were transfected with 0.5 ag of 4-ere-linked
firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.05 ag of renilla plasmid in 100
al of transfection solution containing lipofectamine (37). transfection solution was removed after 5 hours, and cells allowed to recover
for 18 to 24 hours. cells were then stimulated with e2, 2me, or their
combination. cells were harvested at 6 or 24 hours after treatment, and
luciferase activity assayed with a dual luciferase reporter assay system
using a td-20/20 luminometer. reporter activity was normalized for
each sample. normalized luciferase activity = firefly luciferase activity /
renilla luciferase activity.
statistical analysis. all experiments were repeated at least thrice. all
blots shown are representative of three separate experiments with mean
of fold changes in intensities reported in the text. statistical difference
between control and treatment groups was determined by one-way
anova followed by dunnet’s test (graphpad prism software program,
san diego, ca). p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

the presence of e2) and the other with vehicle alone (for the
determination of effect of 2me in the absence of e2). in other
words, 100% control in the presence of e2 includes growth
stimulation in the presence of e2. e2 stimulated the growth of
mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cells by 2.4-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively.
figure 1a and b (insets) show expanded versions of the lowconcentration effect of 2me. in the absence of e2, 10 to 500
nmol/l concentrations of 2me showed a proliferation effect,
whereas higher concentrations showed growth inhibition.
however, all 2me concentrations inhibited cell growth in
the presence of 10 nmol/l e2. in the absence of e2, the ic50
(concentration required for 50% of growth inhibition) of 2me
was 1,120 f 70 nmol/l, whereas it was 180 f 30 nmol/l
in the presence of e2. for the t- xxxd751xxx  cells, ic50 of 2me was
1,950 f 150 nmol/l in the absence of e2, and 450 f 75
nmol/l in the presence of e2. thus, at physiologically relevant
concentrations, 2me showed a significant growth-stimulatory
effect in the absence of e2, and a growth-inhibitory effect in
the presence of e2.
figure 1c shows the effects of 2me on the growth of sk-br-3
cells. for these experiments, sk-br-3 cells were grown under
the same growth conditions as that used for mcf-7 cells. 2me
did not have a significant effect on the growth of these cells up
to 2.5 amol/l concentration, either in the presence or absence
of e2.
in other experiments, we tested whether antiproliferative
effects observed in the presence of e2 + 2me is similar to the
effect of a high dose of e2. we therefore compared the effect
of 10 and 60 nmol/l e2 (equivalent to 10 nmol/l e2 + 50
nmol/l 2me) on mcf-7 cell growth. we found that both 10
and 60 nmol/l e2 exerted a similar growth stimulation (2.3 f
0.1-fold increase compared with the control) on day 4 of
treatment. this is not surprising because the antiproliferative

effect of high-dose e2 is generally observed at micromolar
concentrations (38).
effect of 2me on akt phosphorylation in the absence or presence
of e2. because the akt-mediated phosphorylation pathway
plays a key role in cell growth regulation, we determined the
effects of e2 on akt phosphorylation in mcf-7 cells. sixteen
hours after seeding, cells were treated with 10 nmol/l e2
and harvested at 3, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after treatment.
cellular extract was analyzed by western blots using an
antibody specific to phospho-akt ser473. subsequently, blots
were stripped and reblotted with an antibody that recognized
total akt. our results (fig. 2a and b) showed a significant (2.7fold) increase in ser473 phosphorylation of akt in cells treated
with e2 for 5 minutes, compared with the control. phospho-akt
levels decreased after 30 minutes of e2 treatment. however,
there was no significant change in the level of total akt under
this treatment condition. the blot was stripped further and
probed with an anti-h-actin antibody to ensure equal loading.
we also examined the effect of e2 on akt phosphorylation in
mcf-7 cells using an antibody that recognized thr308 phosphorylation site. thr308 phosphorylation also showed similar
kinetics with a maximal induction of 2.4-fold at 5 minutes of e2
treatment and a significant decrease from the maximal levels by
30 minutes of treatment (results not shown).
we next examined the effect of 2me on akt phosphorylation
using the antibody that recognized the ser473 site. mcf-7 cells
were treated with 10 nmol/l e2 in combination with 10, 25, or
50 nmol/l 2me for 5 minutes. our results showed that 10
nmol/l of e2 induced a 3-fold increase in phospho-akt levels
(fig. 3a). 2me caused a dose-dependent decrease in e2-induced
phospho-akt level. in the presence of 50 nmol/l 2me, the
phospho-akt band intensity was reduced to a level similar to
that of the control. in contrast, total akt level remained
unchanged under all treatment conditions, as determined by
stripping the blot and reprobing it with an antibody that
recognized total akt. thus, 2me disrupted the e2-mediated
signaling process, leading to a decrease in akt phosphorylation.
we next examined the effect of 2me on akt phosphorylation
in mcf-7 cells in the absence of e2. cells were treated with 10,

cells were treated with e2 + 2me (a) or 2me alone (b) for 5 minutes. cells were
harvested and analyzed by western blotting using an anti-phospho-akt antibody,
specific for ser473 phosphorylation, followed by an antibody specific to total akt.
stripping and reblotting with an anti-h-actin antibody showed equal loading and
transfer.

15, 30, and 60 minutes. cells were harvested and analyzed by sequential western blots, using antibodies specific to phospho-akt, total akt, and h-actin. b, cells were
treated with 10 nmol/l of e2 and 10, 25, and 50 nmol/l 2me for 5 minutes. cell lysate was analyzed by western blots using antibodies specific to phospho-akt, akt, and
h-actin. c, cells were treated with 10, 25, and 50 nmol/l 2me for 5 minutes and the cell lysate was analyzed by western blots.

25, and 50 nmol/l 2me and were harvested 5 minutes after
treatment. our results showed that 2me treatment caused a
dose-dependent increase in akt phosphorylation (fig. 3b).
thus, 2me could initiate nongenomic signaling in the absence
of e2. however, this effect was not efficient  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l 2me,
but was effective at 50 nmol/l, resulting in an akt phosphorylation level 2.5-fold higher than that of control (p < 0.05). in
the case of e2, even 0.1 nmol/l e2 showed increased akt
phosphorylation (results not shown). these results showed that
the ability of 2me to initiate membrane signaling was lower
than that of e2.
figure 4 shows the effects of e2, 2me or their combinations
on akt phosphorylation in t- xxxd751xxx  cells. e2 induced akt
phosphorylation by 2.5-fold, 5 minutes after its addition
(fig. 4a). phospho-akt levels decreased by 60 minutes of e2
treatment. e2-induced akt phosphorylation was reduced by
cotreatment of cells with e2 and 2me (fig. 4b). there was a
dose-dependent decrease in phospho-akt levels when e2 was
present with 10, 25, and 50 nmol/l of 2me. in contrast, there
was an increase in akt phosphorylation when cells were treated
with 2me alone, particularly at the 50 nmol/l concentration
(fig. 4c).
subcellular localization of era by confocal microscopy.
because akt phosphorylation by e2 and 2me is likely to be
mediated by membrane er, we next examined the intracellular
distribution of era in mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cells and changes in
its distribution in response to e2, 2me, or their combination.
time course experiments at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes
showed that e2 treatment produced major changes in the
distribution of era after 30 and 60 minutes of treatment.
figure 5a shows representative results of the effects of 2me on
era distribution in the absence or presence of e2 in mcf-7
cells. the majority of era in untreated cells seemed to be evenly
distributed in the nucleus, with mild cytoplasmic and
membrane staining. arrows point to regions that are magnified
in the side panels and illustrate changes in era membrane
staining. at 30 minutes of e2 treatment, there was a marked
redistribution of era with focal accumulation in specific sites
in the nucleus. in contrast, cells treated with 10 nmol/l of 2me
alone showed intense and even distribution of era in the
nucleus. in cells treated with e2 + 10 nmol/l 2me, era
remained intensely stained in the nucleus and showed a
punctate pattern without focal accumulation in nuclear sites.
similar results, showing the inhibition of the subcellular
distribution of era were obtained when e2 was administered

in combination with 25 nmol/l 2me, although 25 nmol/l
2me alone showed focal accumulation comparable to that of
10 nmol/l e2-treated cells. in contrast, cells treated with 10
nmol/l e2 + 25 nmol/l 2me showed diffuse and even era
nuclear staining pattern. these results show that that 2me
could disrupt the e2-induced subcellular distribution of era.
figure 5b shows the confocal microscopic images of the
intracellular distribution of era in t- xxxd751xxx  cells in the presence
of e2 and 2me as single agents and in combination. the results
of this study showed cytoplasmic and nuclear era in the
absence of e2. a redistribution of era including membrane
localization, was found after cells were treated with e2. when
2me was present with e2, era localized in the nucleus, and less
frequently on the membrane sites. because mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx 
cell lines behaved similarly in growth response, akt phosphorylation and era distribution, we next focused our studies on
the mcf-7 cell line.
effect of e2 and 2me on the generation of camp in mcf-7
cells. we tested the ability of e2 to induce camp in
mcf-7 cells and the effect of 2me on e2-mediated camp
production. cells were treated with e2 or e2 + 2me for different
time periods and were harvested. cells were lysed and assayed
using a camp enzyme immunoassay kit. a 3-fold increase in
camp was detected 5 minutes after the addition of e2 (fig. 6).
the maximal value of camp was f 200 pmol/mg protein in
the presence of e2. the presence of 10 nmol/l 2me inhibited
e2-induced increase in camp at 5 minutes of treatment. the
increase in camp levels after e2 treatment decreased by 30
minutes, but remained higher than that of the control. however,
10 nmol/l 2me alone did not have a significant effect on camp
levels at any time point. on the other hand, 50 nmol/l of 2me
increased camp levels by 2-fold at 5 minutes after treatment
(results not shown). these results further showed nongenomic
signaling by e2 and its inhibition by 2me.
effects of e2 and 2me on odc activity in mcf-7 cells. figure 7
shows the effects of e2 and 2me on odc activity in mcf-7
cells, 24 hours after treatment. e2-induced a 2-fold increase in
odc activity and this increase was down-regulated by
cotreatment with 10 and 50 nmol/l of 2me. in the absence
of e2, 50 nmol/l of 2me significantly increased odc activity.
these results showed that e2-induced odc activity was
suppressed by 10 to 50 nmol/l of 2me, although 2me could
increase odc activity in the absence of e2. we also
determined the activity of other enzymes in the polyamine
biosynthetic and catabolic pathways in mcf-7 cells treated

effects of e2 and 2me on ere-reporter activity. we next
examined whether genomic responses such as e2-induced ere
reporter gene activation was affected by e2, 2me, or their
combination. cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with 0.5 ag of ere-linked firefly luciferase plasmid
and 0.05 ag of renilla luciferase, using lipofectamine as the
transfection agent. cells were 80% to 90% confluent at the time
of transfection and maintained in the transfection medium
for 5 hours. cells were stimulated with e2, 2me, or their
combination 24 hours after changing the transfection medium.
cells were harvested and reporter gene activity was assayed at 6
and 24 hours after treatments. results are presented in terms of
fold induction of luciferase activity compared with samples not
treated with e2 (fig. 9). our results show that e2 stimulated ere
reporter gene activity 2- to 3-fold higher than that of the
control. the presence of 2me suppressed e2-induced reporter
gene activity by 38% (24 hours), compared with e2-treated
group. however, 2me was only mildly (1.4-fold) active in
stimulating ere reporter gene activity compared with the
control. these results show that 2me can suppress the genomic
responses of e2, although this suppression is not as effective as
the nongenomic responses.

discussion
table 1 shows polyamine levels in the presence and absence of
e2. e2 induced a significant increase in the levels of putrescine,
spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx  both at 24- and 48-hour time points.
in cells treated with e2 + 10 nmol/l 2me, there was a trend
toward decreases in putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx 
levels at the 24-hour time point, compared with e2-treated
samples. in cells treated with e2 + 50 nmol/l 2me, there was a
significant down-regulation of all three polyamines, both at the
24- and 48-hour time points, compared with e2-treated
samples. these results show that the antiproliferative effect of
2me involves a general down-regulation of polyamine levels. in
the absence of e2, 50 nmol/l of 2me caused a significant
increase in putrescine levels. in contrast, there was no
significant increase in spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels due to
2me treatment.
effect of e2 and 2me on era levels. ligands such as e2,
tamoxifen, and  xxxd2165xxx  are known to modulate the steadystate levels of era, due to alterations in the degradation of era
(39, 40). therefore, we examined whether the down-regulation
of era levels was associated with antiproliferative effects of
2me in the presence of e2. cells were treated with e2, 2me, or
their combination and harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hours. era
levels were determined by western blot analysis using an antiera antibody. our results showed a marginal change in era
levels after 24 hours of treatment with e2, 2me, or their
combination (fig. 8). however, at 48 hours of treatment, there
was a 50% reduction in era in cells treated with e2, whereas in
cells treated with 2me alone, era levels remained similar to
that of untreated controls. in contrast, in cells treated with e2 +
2me, there was a decrease in era levels from 24 to 72 hours. by
72 hours of treatment, era level was reduced by 95%
compared with the control. e2-induced down-regulation of
era is believed to counter the estrogenic response, providing a
feedback control (39, 40). however, when e2 is combined with
2me, the degradation of era seems to be enhanced. increased
down-regulation of era may contribute to growth inhibition in
the presence of e2/2me combinations.

clin cancer res 2006;12(7) april 1, 2006

results presented in this report show that 2me could induce
contrasting estrogenic or antiestrogenic behavior in er-positive
mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cell lines, depending on the absence/
presence of e2 in the growth medium. in the absence of e2,
physiologic concentrations of 2me enhanced nongenomic
signaling events, such as the phosphorylation of akt. however,
e2-induced phosphorylation of akt was suppressed by 2me,
contributing to its antiestrogenic effect. further analysis of the
effect of 2me on e2-induced increase in camp levels in mcf-7
cells showed that 2me suppressed the increase in camp,
providing support for the idea that nongenomic responses of e2
are suppressed by 2me. consistent with the growth-stimulatory
effect of 2me, odc activity was increased by 2me alone. in

contrast, e2-induced odc activity was suppressed by 2me.
polyamine levels showed a varied response; putrescine levels
showing an increase in the presence of 50 nmol/l 2me,
whereas spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels were either not
affected or decreased. e2-induced increases in polyamine levels
were down-regulated by 10 to 50 nmol/l of 2me, consistent
with the growth-inhibitory effects of 2me under these
conditions. furthermore, 2me suppressed e2-induced genomic
estrogenic response of ere reporter gene activation, 24 hours
after treatment. long-term treatment (72 hours) showed that
2me reduced steady-state levels of era in the presence of e2.
thus, the estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects of 2me have
multiple components, resulting in growth stimulation or
growth inhibition under different treatment conditions. it is
also important to note here that the studies of liu and zhu (9)
showed that 2me was not transformed to estrogenic metabolites in mcf-7 cells. the antiestrogenic effect of 2me is also
consistent with our recent findings on the effect of 2me on the
phosphorylation of activating transcription factor-2, which is
involved in e2-induced transcription of  xxxg366xxx  (12).
our confocal microscopic results show the ability of 2me to
alter e2-induced shuttling of era between different sites within
the cell. after 30 minutes of e2-treatment, there was a
movement of era to the periphery of the cells and a focal
accumulation in specific regions of the nucleus. ligand-induced
redistribution of era and other nuclear receptors has been
reported previously (41). this redistribution is believed to be
due to the dissociation of native complexes and formation of
new complexes pertinent to transcriptional activation, receptor
recycling, and degradation. the combination of e2 + 2me
blocked this redistribution. confocal microscopic studies of
song et al. (24) showed that e2 induced shuttling of era from

the nucleus to the membrane as a part of the association of era
with growth factor receptors and adaptor proteins. membrane
era level is estimated to be between 2% and 20% of the total
era (20, 42) and changes in this distribution may affect the
signaling pathways initiated by e2.
current evidence suggests the participation of membrane
ers, g proteins such as gpr30, cell surface growth factor
receptors, as well as the modulator of nongenomic activity of
er (also known as pelp1, for proline- xxxd2431xxx  – and
leucine-rich protein 1) in nongenomic e2 signaling (20 – 24).
although the measured relative binding affinity of 2me for era
is only f1% to 2% of that of e2, correlating to transcriptional
effects (9, 10), this may not represent the true affinity of the
compound for a multiprotein complex on the cell surface. the
conformational flexibility of era in the presence of different
ligands and eres (43, 44) suggests that it can easily assume
different conformations; perhaps an agonist-like conformation
in the presence of 2me alone, and an antagonist conformation
in the presence of e2/2me combinations. for example, a novel
mode of binding of era has been reported for a series of
estrogenic ligands with low relative binding affinities, but
potent biological activity (45). it is possible that the conformation of era provoked by e2/2me combination might be
amenable to facile degradation compared with the conformation induced by 2me alone.
2me is capable of initiating cell signaling processes
including akt phosphorylation, odc activation, and production of camp in mcf-7 cells. however, not all the variables
follow a similar dose-response, suggesting that multiple
pathways might be involved. 2me (10 nmol/l) inhibited e2induced dna synthesis and down-regulated  xxxg366xxx  (12).
e2-induced camp was also down-regulated by 10 nmol/l 2me.
however, maximal down-regulation of akt phosphorylation

cells were treated with e2, 2me, or their combinations, and changes in era levels
were determined by western blot analysis, using an anti-era antibody. cells were
harvested for western blots after 24, 48, or 72 hours of treatment. after probing
with anti-era antibody, membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-h-actin
antibody to ensure equal loading and transfer.

fig. 9. effects of e2, 2me, or their combinations on the genomic effect of reporter

a renilla luciferase plasmid. subsequently, cells were treated with e2, 2me or their
combinations. cells were harvested after 6 and 24 hours of treatment and luciferase
activity was determined by dual luciferase assay system. a control plasmid  xxxg2041xxx 
was also used to examine e2 response. there was no change in fold induction of

was only found at 50 nmol/l 2me. it seems that e2 signaling
is inhibited by 2me as it encounters the multiprotein receptor
system containing e2, era, and other proteins. gpr30 may
not be sufficient to support the action of 2me because
significant growth-stimulatory effects were not observed in our
studies of sk-br-3 cells, although it is reported to express this
g protein (23).
whereas the generation of camp on mcf-7 cells has been
associated with growth stimulation and growth inhibition, these
effects vary with the intensity and duration of camp response
(46). in the current studies, e2-induced camp was suppressed by
2me under conditions of growth inhibition. although it is well
known that camp levels regulate cell growth, the pathways
affected in breast cancer cells are not clear. one possibility is that
camp induced the up-regulation of  xxxg185xxx , an epidermal
growth factor – like growth factor, that binds and activates the
egf receptor (47). this pathway includes the activation of
 xxxg1836xxx  and the phosphorylation of camp-responsive
element binding proteins. a decrease in camp levels could
therefore lead to a decrease in camp-responsive element
binding protein activation, associated with the down-regulation
of  xxxg366xxx  and cell growth inhibition (48).
e2-induced akt phosphorylation is reported to be due to the
activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase in breast cancer cells
(26, 49). the mechanism of activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway may involve e2-induced ras signaling
and/or direct interaction of era with the p85 subunit of
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (49). akt activation is reported to
stimulate multiple cell survival pathways, including the
phosphorylation of bad, preventing apoptotic signaling and
contributing to cell proliferation response (26, 49). aktmediated phosphorylation of gsk-3h is also known to regulate
 xxxg366xxx  stability and nuclear localization (50). e2 is also
known to enhance the activity of other kinase cascades (51)
and characterization of e2-induced genomic and nongenomic

clin cancer res 2006;12(7) april 1, 2006

responses contributing to cell growth regulation remains far
from complete. it is also interesting to note that other
compounds, such as resveratrol, induced the expression of
 xxxg1737xxx  gene in mcf-7 cells when used as a
single agent, but the expression of the  xxxg1737xxx 
gene was suppressed when resveratrol was used in combination
with e2. the mixed agonist/antagonist action of resveratrol was
also observed in vivo in mammary tissues of animal models of
breast cancer (52).
a recent study showed that e2-induced generation of camp
was involved in e2-induced activation of odc gene expression
(53). previous studies have shown that e2 increased odc
mrna expression at 8 hours of treatment (30). thus, e2 may
have genomic and nongenomic effects on the expression of
odc gene and odc activity. although 50 nmol/l of 2me
increased odc activity and enhanced putrescine levels,
whereas spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels were not enhanced.
this result indicates a branching point in e2-induced signaling
compared with 2me-induced signaling. polyamines are regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of
biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes as well as membranemediated influx and efflux pathways (29, 54). a microarray
study on multiple myeloma cell lines showed a decrease in
spermidine synthase in cells treated with 2me (55). however,
these down-regulatory responses of 2me might have been
compensated in the long-term, resulting in cell proliferation
after treatment with 10 to 50 nmol/l of 2me for 4 days.
the results of the present study might have implications on
the clinical trials for developing 2me as a potential therapeutic
agent for breast cancer. the mixed agonist/antagonist activity of
2me in er-positive cells may also account for the discrepancy
between different studies contributing to the ongoing controversy on the potential clinical usefulness of 2me (18).
investigators have usually focused on either the agonist activity
in the absence of e2 or the effects of 2me at micromolar
concentrations where apoptotic action is the dominant effect
(7, 14, 17). the observation of growth-stimulatory effects of
2me in mcf-7 nude mice xenografts in the absence of e2 has
led sutherland and collaborators to conclude that 2me is
inappropriate for the evaluation for breast cancer therapy (17).
this conclusion was questioned by investigators involved in the
development of 2me for clinical use in breast cancer (18). a
large body of data including clinical studies on 170 patients
indicates the safety of the compound in humans (56). 2me also
showed synergistic growth-inhibitory action on breast cancer
cells when combined with microtubule-disrupting agents,
paclitaxel, or  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx  (57).
in summary, our results show that 2me could exert
estrogenic or antiestrogen-like action in the same cell line
depending on the absence/presence of e2. 2me inhibited e2induced nongenomic responses such as akt phosphorylation
and camp signaling as well as e2-induced transcription of the
ere-linked reporter gene. the era protein level was also altered
in the presence of e2/2me combinations. these different effects
might contribute to the ability of 2me to suppress e2-induced
cell growth. the reduction of odc activity and polyamine
levels following 2me treatment may also contribute to the
antiproliferative activity of 2me in the presence of e2. in
contrast, mcf-7 and t- xxxd751xxx  cells responded to 2me like an
estrogen under conditions of estrogen deprivation. confocal
microscopic studies further support the differential effects of

2me and e2 + 2me on subcellular distribution of era in these
cells. because 2me is in clinical trials, our results call for caution
in the administration of 2me to patients with breast cancer,
and yet offer the possibility that 2me might have beneficial
anticancer effects in subsets of patients.
