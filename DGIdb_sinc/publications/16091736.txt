nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) including  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde are known to exert cancer chemopreventative activity in a range of cell lines. this activity
has been shown to involve the upregulation of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx . it is also known
that nsaids can act as peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (ppar) agonists and antagonists. in this study,
we show that  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde acts both as a pparc
agonist and a  xxxg1806xxx  antagonist in an immortalized
prostatic epithelial cell line (pnt1a). we utilized sirna
technology to show that pparc is required for both
growth inhibition and p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  upregulation in response
to  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde treatment in pnt1a cells. in addition,
the overexpression of  xxxg1806xxx  partially rescued these
cells from growth inhibition and also dramatically inhibited  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  upregulation.
together these data identify a novel link between pparc/
 xxxg1806xxx /p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  and the cancer chemo-preventative
properties of nsaids.

prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
deaths among men and is difﬁcult to treat with
conventional therapies. the identiﬁcation of targets
to prevent prostate carcinogenesis is an alternative
approach, which may prove to be effective in lowering
the burden of this disease. one such group of targets
is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
(ppars). ppars are members of the class ii nuclear
receptor superfamily (mangelsdorf et al., 1995) which
includes a number of other hormone receptors, forming
heterodimers with rxr upon activation. since their
discovery, ppars have been well established as master
regulators of adipogenesis (morrison and farmer, 1999)
and lipid homeostasis (tontonoz et al., 1994).  xxxg1807xxx  is
expressed in prostate cancer cell lines and activation of
 xxxg1807xxx  within these cell lines has been shown to result in

growth inhibition (mueller et al., 2000). in contrast to
 xxxg1807xxx , the role of ubiquitously expressed  xxxg1806xxx  in
regulating the growth of human prostate cells is a novel
area of research. however, we have recently shown that
 xxxg1806xxx  agonists have a pro-proliferative effect on
human prostate cancer cells (stephen et al., 2004).
from these data, it appears that  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx 
have opposing roles in regulating the growth of human
prostate cells.
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) are
a group of compounds possessing both anti-inﬂammatory and analgesic properties. nsaids have been shown
to suppress colorectal carcinogenesis in both animal
models and humans (smalley and dubois, 1997). the
nsaid  xxxd3259xxx  has the ability to upregulate p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx 
expression in colon carcinoma cell lines (goldberg et al.,
1996). similarly when p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  is inactivated in apcmin/ þ
mice,  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde no longer has the ability to lower
the number of intestinal tumours (yang et al., 2001),
indicating that p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  is an absolute requirement
for the anticancer effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde.
several nsaids including indomethacin, fenoprofen,
ﬂufenamic acid and ibuprofen have been shown to
activate  xxxg1807xxx  at concentrations of 100 mm (lehmann
et al., 1997). the nsaid diclofenac can also bind to
 xxxg1807xxx  at nanomolar concentrations, in this case
resulting in an antagonistic interaction (adamson
et al., 2002). the activity of  xxxg1806xxx  is inhibited by
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde which has been shown to prevent
 xxxg1806xxx /rxr heterodimers from binding to their
recognition sequences (he et al., 1999). since  xxxd3259xxx 
sulﬁde can activate  xxxg1807xxx  (wick et al., 2002) and
inhibit  xxxg1806xxx  (he et al., 1999), we hypothesized that
the growth inhibitory effects of this compound may be
mediated by p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  upregulation through a dual
pathway involving  xxxg1807xxx  activation and  xxxg1806xxx 
repression.
previous studies into the role of ppars in proliferation have been performed using highly transformed
cancer cell lines. in order to assess the action of  xxxd3259xxx 
sulﬁde on ppars in precancerous cells an immortalized
cell line (pnt1a) derived from normal human prostatic
epithelium (cussenot et al., 1991) was utilized as a
model of premalignant disease.
although  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde has been studied as a
 xxxg1807xxx  agonist and a  xxxg1806xxx  antagonist in separate
cellular contexts, we wished to determine the ability of

 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde to mediate both of these effects in
pnt1a cells. we, therefore, examined the effect of
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde on ppar response elements (ppres).
by transfecting expression vectors encoding either
 xxxg1807xxx  or  xxxg1806xxx , we were able to ascertain the
effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde on the activity of each
receptor. figure 1a shows that a known  xxxg1807xxx  agonist,
rosiglitazone (1 mm) resulted in the activation of
transcription from the ppar target gene liver fatty
acid binding protein (dr1) 4-tk-gl3 (lfabp) containing a ppre reporter construct by approximately 30fold (***po0.001). activation of lfabp is dependent

on both additional  xxxg1807xxx  expression vector and
rosiglitazone. figure 1b shows that a known  xxxg1806xxx 
agonist, gw501516 (10 nm) activated  xxxg1806xxx  by
approximately 3.5-fold (***po0.001) and this effect
was also dependent upon both additional  xxxg1806xxx 
expression vector and gw501516. depending on
whether  xxxg1807xxx  or  xxxg1806xxx  was exogenously introduced
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde acted as a  xxxg1807xxx  agonist activating
transcription from the lfabp reporter construct by
greater than 10-fold (***po0.001) (figure 1c) and a
 xxxg1806xxx  antagonist, repressing transcription from the
lfabp reporter construct by approximately 75%

figure 1  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde activates lfabp transcription in the presence of ppar-g but represses lfabp transcription in the
presence of  xxxg1806xxx . cells were transfected with 500 ng psv b-gal control vector (promega), either 50 ng of pcldn  xxxg1807xxx  ( þ g) or
50 ng pcldn (g) vector alone and 25 ng ppar target gene liver fatty acid binding protein (dr1) 4-tk-gl3 (lfabp) containing a
peroxisome proliferator activated response element (ppre) using lipofectamine 2000t. (invitrogen). after 24 h cells were treated with
either dmso (0.1%) as a control or the  xxxg1807xxx  agonist rosiglitazone (alexis) (1 mm) (ros) for 18 h. cells were lysed in reporter lysis
buffer (promega). luciferase activities were determined, divided by b-gal values and expressed as relative light units (rlu), relative to
the control. (a) rosiglitazone activates transcription from the lfabp reporter construct only in the presence of exogenously
introduced  xxxg1807xxx  ***po0.001. (b) the transfection was repeated as before with either 50 ng of pcldn  xxxg1806xxx  ( þ d) or 50 ng
pcldn (d) vector alone, cells were treated with either dmso (0.1%) or the  xxxg1806xxx  agonist gw501516 (10 nm) (gw) for 18 h.
gw501516 activates transcription from lfabp reporter construct only in the presence of exogenously introduced  xxxg1806xxx 
***po0.001. (c)  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde (150 mm) (ss) also activates lfabp in the presence of additional  xxxg1807xxx  expression vector ( þ g)
when compared against the vector alone (g) ***po0.001. (d)  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde (150 mm) (ss) represses lfabp in the presence of
additional  xxxg1806xxx  expression vector ( þ d) when compared against the vector alone (d) **po0.01. (e)  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde does not
antagonize rosiglitazone activation of  xxxg1807xxx  (no difference between rosiglitazone (ros) and rosiglitazone, combined with  xxxd3259xxx 
sulﬁde (ros þ ss), (p>0.05). (f)  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde antagonizes the activation of  xxxg1806xxx  by gw501516 (**po0.01)

(**po0.01) (figure 1d). in the presence of exogenous
 xxxg1807xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde activated  xxxg1807xxx  to the same
extent as rosiglitazone (***po0.001) and no synergistic
effect was observed (figure 1e). in the presence
of exogenous  xxxg1806xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde was able to
repress gw501516 activation of  xxxg1806xxx  (**po0.01)
(figure 1f).

to determine what extent  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated
pnt1a growth inhibition is dependent on  xxxg1807xxx  and
 xxxg1806xxx , we utilized sirna technology to deplete cells
of  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  mrna. in these experiments, we
were able to reduce levels of  xxxg1807xxx  mrna by in excess
of 90% (***po0.001) (figure 2a) and protein to a lesser
extent (figure 2b) and  xxxg1806xxx  mrna by greater than

figure 2  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde maintains its growth inhibitory effects in the absence of  xxxg1806xxx  but not  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  is required for
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-induced p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  upregulation. cells were transfected with smartpool sirna duplexes (5 nm) (dharmacon) of
either  xxxg1807xxx : agactcagctctacaataa gaagttcaatgcactggaa aagtaactctcctcaaata gcatttc
tactccacatta,  xxxg1806xxx : gagcgcagctgcaagattc gcatgaagctggagt acga ggaagcagttggtgaatgg
gctgcaagattcagaagaa or a nonspeciﬁc scrambled oligo control. after 48 h cells were lysed and rna was extracted using an
rneasys mini kit (qiagen). cdna was synthesized using standard reverse transcription pcr techniques. steady-state levels of mrna
encoding  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  were determined by real time quantitative pcr as previously described (young et al., 2002). western
blotting was performed using standard techniques performed on either 10% glycerol gels ( xxxg1807xxx ) or 10% sds–page gels ( xxxg1806xxx ).
the primary antibodies used were as follows: antirabbit raised against the ab domain of human  xxxg1807xxx  (1 : 2500).  xxxg1806xxx  nuc-1
(1 : 500) (vosper et al., 2001). b-actin anti-goat (1 : 2000) (santa cruz).  xxxg1807xxx  (a) mrna ***po0.001 and (b) protein levels are
reduced after sirna introduction, as are  xxxg1806xxx  (c) mrna ***po0.001 and (d) protein levels when compared against the nonspeciﬁc
(ns) control. the sirna experiment was carried out as before and after the second round of sirna cells were treated with either
0.1% dmso or  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde (150 mm) (ss). the measurement of cell numbers was performed as described (stephen et al., 2004). ns
sirna-treated cells are responsive to the growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde, **po0.01, as are  xxxg1806xxx  sirna-treated cells
**po0.01. (e) the proliferation of  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-treated  xxxg1807xxx  sirna compared to dmso-treated  xxxg1807xxx  sirna pnt1a cells is
not signiﬁcantly different p>0.05. the expression of p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna and protein was also carried out after ns and  xxxg1807xxx  sirna
and  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde treatment. analysis for p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna was carried out with the following forward, reverse primers and probe:
f: 50 -gactctcagggtcgaaaacgg-30 , r: 50 -gcggattagggcttcctctt-30 , p: ctaccactccaaacgccgct
gatct. western blotting was performed on 12% sds–page gels, using the primary antibody p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mouse monoclonal
(1 : 1000) (fredersdorf et al., 1996). pnt1a ns sirna-treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde for 48 h have upregulated p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  (f) mrna
**po0.01 and (g) protein levels when compared against dmso alone. (h) p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna in  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-treated  xxxg1807xxx 
sirna cells is not signiﬁcantly different from dmso-treated  xxxg1807xxx  sirna cells, p>0.05. (i) pnt1a  xxxg1807xxx  sirna cells do not

90% (***po0.001) (figure 2c) and protein, again to a
lesser extent (figure 2d). sirna transfected cells were
then treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde. cells that had been
transfected with nonspeciﬁc sequences underwent  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated growth inhibition by approximately 70% (**po0.01), as did  xxxg1806xxx -depleted cells
(**po0.01), which initially would imply that  xxxg1806xxx 
suppression is not required for the response to  xxxd3259xxx 
sulﬁde. conversely, depletion of  xxxg1807xxx  by sirna
virtually abolished the growth inhibitory effects of
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde and these cells did not undergo any
signiﬁcant growth inhibition compared to the dmsotreated control (p>0.5) (figure 2e). we then explored
the hypothesis that  xxxg1807xxx  has a role in the upregulation of p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  by  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde. cells transfected
with nonspeciﬁc control sirna demonstrated  xxxd3259xxx 
sulﬁde-mediated p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna upregulation by
approximately threefold (**po0.01) (figure 2f). this
was reﬂected in p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  protein upregulation
(figure 2g). however, the depletion of  xxxg1807xxx  in these
cells resulted in the loss of  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated
p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna (p>0.05) (figure 2h) and protein
(figure 2i) upregulation, which remained unaltered
relative to the dmso-treated control. this supports
the novel hypothesis that  xxxg1807xxx  activation by  xxxd3259xxx 
sulﬁde is required for p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx -mediated growth
inhibition.
in order to dissect the role of  xxxg1806xxx  antagonism in
mediating  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde growth inhibition we overexpressed  xxxg1806xxx  protein by 3.8-fold (figure 3a). the
moderate overexpression of  xxxg1806xxx  rendered cells
approximately 40% more resilient to  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁdeinduced growth inhibition (***po0.001) (figure 3b).
the overexpression of  xxxg1806xxx  also dramatically reduced
the capability of cells to upregulate p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  following  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde treatment. cells transfected with
pcldn vector alone underwent p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna
upregulation by more than ﬁvefold (**po0.01)
(figure 3c), which was also reﬂected in strong p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx 
protein upregulation (figure 3d). conversely, cells
transfected with pcldn  xxxg1806xxx  failed to show any
signiﬁcant increases in p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna (p>0.5)
(figure 3e) and displayed greatly reduced p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx 
protein upregulation (figure 3f).
daily use of nsaids has been associated with a
reduction in prostate cancer risk (nelson and harris,
2000). initially, it was believed that the antineoplastic
activity of nsaids was mediated by their ability to bind
to and inhibit cyclooxygenase (cox) enzymes. cox
enzymes are responsible for mediating the conversion of
 xxxd208xxx  into prostaglandins. since particular
types of prostaglandins have been shown to promote
carcinogenesis (lupulescu, 1978) it seemed logical that
this hypothesis was correct. however, it has since been
shown that nsaids can inhibit growth and cause the
death of cells not expressing cox enzymes (hanif et al.,
1996). furthermore, the nsaid derivative  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone is unable to inhibit cox but retains the ability
to inhibit tumour growth (piazza et al., 1997) hence
other pathways may also play a role. other groups have
conﬁrmed  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde as a  xxxg1807xxx  agonist and also
oncogene

figure 3 overexpression of  xxxg1806xxx  renders cells more resistant to
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde induced growth inhibition and protects cells from
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  upregulation. cells were
plated out for transfection as previously described for transactivation studies and transfected with either 1 mg of pcldn
vector or 1 mg of pcldn  xxxg1806xxx  expression vector. (a) samples
were taken for western blotting analysis of  xxxg1806xxx  as previously
described. (b) after transfection, cells were treated for 48 h with
either dmso (0.1%) or  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde (150 mm) (ss), growth
experiments were performed as previously described and cell
survival measured. increased protein expression of  xxxg1806xxx 
partially protects cells from  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated growth
inhibition ***po0.001. p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  expression was also measured
as previously described in pcldn vector alone or pcldn  xxxg1806xxx 
transfected cells after  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde treatment. (c) pcldn
transfected cells treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde for 48 h have
upregulated p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna **po0.01 and (d) protein levels
when compared against dmso control. (e) p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  mrna in
 xxxg1806xxx  transfected cells treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde is not
signiﬁcantly different from those treated with dmso, p>0.05.
(f) p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  protein in  xxxg1806xxx  transfected cells treated with
 xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde is also not strongly upregulated compared to
dmso treated alone

proposed it as an important factor of cox independent
inhibition of lung cancer cell growth (wick et al., 2002).
our experiments extrapolate from this work functionally implicating  xxxg1807xxx  in  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated
growth inhibition. we also further demonstrate that this
is achieved by p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  upregulation, a previously
established mechanism of  xxxg1807xxx  ligand-mediated
growth inhibition (hong et al., 2004).
previous studies have also implicated  xxxg1806xxx  in
mediating the anticancer effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde. he
et al. (1999) proposed an antagonistic effect of  xxxd3259xxx 
sulﬁde on  xxxg1806xxx , which they initially believed to be
responsible for the induction of apoptosis in colon
cancer cells. however, after depleting colon cancer cells

8215

of  xxxg1806xxx , the authors observed that  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁdemediated apoptosis still occurred and concluded  xxxg1806xxx 
repression was not responsible for this effect (park et al.,
2001). similarly, our experiments using sirna of
 xxxg1806xxx  failed to inhibit  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated
growth inhibition. however, depletion of  xxxg1806xxx  by
sirna was sufﬁcient to slow the growth of the cells
(data not shown) consistent with that previously
observed with deletion of the  xxxg1806xxx  gene (park et al.,
2001). this implies that maximum growth inhibition
from interrupting  xxxg1806xxx  signalling was achieved via
 xxxg1806xxx  depletion, thus we considered a gain of
function approach as more amenable to study  xxxg1806xxx 
antagonism. moderate  xxxg1806xxx  overexpression partially
protected cells from  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-mediated growth
inhibition and also virtually abolished  xxxd3259xxx  sulﬁde-

mediated p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx  upregulation. importantly,  xxxg1806xxx 
has been shown to be overexpressed in some cancers
(he et al., 1999) and (gupta et al., 2000). together,
these results offer insight into the observed efﬁcacy of
nsaids in cancer chemoprevention and also reveal a
mechanism by which advanced cancers may be less
sensitive to such compounds.
