 xxxg487xxx  (comt) plays important roles in the metabolism of catecholamine neurotransmitters and catechol estrogens. the development of comt inhibitors for use in the treatment of parkinson's disease
has been aided by crystallographic structures of the rat enzyme. however,
the human and rat proteins have significantly different substrate specificities. additionally, human comt contains a common valine–methionine
polymorphism at position 108. the methionine protein is less stable than the
valine polymorph, resulting in decreased enzyme activity and protein levels
in vivo. here we describe the crystal structures of the 108v and 108m
variants of the soluble form of human comt bound with s- xxxd3156xxx  (sam) and a substrate analog,  xxxd36xxx . the polymorphic residue 108 is located in the  xxxg834xxx – xxxg838xxx  loop, buried in a hydrophobic
pocket ∼ 16 å from the sam-binding site. the 108v and 108m structures are very similar overall [rmsd of calpha atoms between two structures
(calpha rmsd) = 0.2 å], and the active-site residues are superposable, in accord
with the observation that sam stabilizes 108m comt. however, the
methionine side chain is packed more tightly within the polymorphic site
and, consequently, interacts more closely with residues a22 ( xxxg831xxx ) and  xxxd333xxx 
( xxxg833xxx ) than does valine. these interactions of the larger methionine result in a
0.7-å displacement in the backbone structure near residue 108, which
propagates along alpha1 and  xxxg834xxx  toward the sam-binding site. although the
overall secondary structures of the human and rat proteins are very similar
(calpha rmsd = 0.4 å), several nonconserved residues are present in the
sam-(i89m, i91m, c95y) and catechol- (c173v, r201m, e202k) binding
sites. the human protein also contains three additional solvent-exposed
cysteine residues (c95, c173, c188) that may contribute to intermolecular
disulfide bond formation and protein aggregation.

crystal structures of human 108v and 108m comt

structures of the human protein are desirable because the two proteins differ in their kinetic properties. catechol km values generally are higher in the
rat enzyme than in human comt, and the relative
specificities for particular catechols vary. for example, the km values for rat comt and human comt
for dopamine are 826 ± 16 and 188 ± 16 mm, respectively, while those for 4-hydroxyestradiol are 27.5 ±
2.3 and 12.4 ± 2.6 mm, respectively.21
human comt contains a common polymorphism
at residue 108, which can be either valine (v) or
methionine (m).22–24 approximately 25% of u.s. and
northern european caucasians are homozygous
for the 108m allele, which is much less common
in african and asian populations.25,26 the 108m
allele has been linked with increased risk for breast
cancer,27–30 obsessive–compulsive disorder,31,32 some
manifestations of schizophrenia,33–37 and increased
sensitivity to pain,38,39 but it has also been linked
with improved prefrontal cognitive function, especially in working memory.40,41 it appears to be linked
particularly strongly to neuropsychiatric dysfunction
in velocardiofacial syndrome, a chromosomal disorder resulting from the deletion of multiple contiguous genes, including comt, from one copy of
chromosome 22.37,42,43 a haplotype involving the
108v allele and two noncoding comt polymorphisms has been associated with increased risk for
schizophrenia, possibly because it results in diminished mrna expression or translation.44–48
comparative modeling studies based on the crystal
structures of rat comt put residue 108 in a surface
loop that is some 16 å from the catalytic site,49 and
the v108m polymorphism has relatively little effect
on the enzyme's kinetic parameters.27,50,51 however,
108m comt has lower thermal stability than 108v
comt,50–59 is more prone to inactivation through
oxidation58,60,61 and to unfolding by heat and guanidine hydrochloride,62 and has decreased protein
levels in vivo.51,59,63 molecular dynamics (md) simulations indicate that 108m comt exists in a broader
ensemble of potentially deformed conformational
states at 37 °c than does the 108v protein,49 which
could make the protein more susceptible to proteolysis.
the co-substrate sam protects 108m comt against
both thermal inactivation50 and denaturation.62
here we describe the crystal structures of the
human 108v comt and 108m comt with bound
sam and  xxxd36xxx  (dnc). the two

structures are superposable with a c alpha rmsd
(rmsd of calpha atoms between two structures) of
0.2 å, and the active sites are virtually identical.
there are, however, several intramolecular packing
differences in the vicinity of polymorphic residue
108 that result in the displacement of the backbone
at m108 and in nearby helices alpha1 and  xxxg834xxx . these
differences provide a clue as to how the v/m
substitution at the polymorphic site can destabilize
the protein.

results and discussion
the structure of human comt is composed of a
seven-stranded beta-sheet core (3↑2↑1↑4↑5↑7↓6↑) sandwiched between two sets of alpha-helices (fig. 1). this
structure is characteristic of the sam-dependent
methyltransferase fold family, differing only in the
presence of an extended loop between beta-strands 6
and 7 that forms part of the catechol-binding site.14
helices 6 and 7 contain one turn of a pi-helical structure and 310-helical structure, respectively, possibly
due to the presence of proline residues (p124, p149)
that disrupt the helices. one residue (y68) falls
within the disallowed region of the ramachandran
plot. y68 is located in the sam-binding site, where
the tyrosine side chain adopts an unfavorable conformation that allows sam binding. it has a similar
disallowed geometry in both human comt structures described here and in all published structures
of rat comt, which also contain bound sam or cosubstrate analogs.
the structure of 108v comt contains a k+ bound
in a small pocket defined by alpha8 and beta6 and their
connecting loop (fig. 1). the k+ is coordinated to the
backbone oxygen atoms of v183, r184, s186, and
f189 with a mean distance of 2.75 ± 0.25 å, and to the
oxygen atoms of two water molecules with a mean
distance of 2.91 ± 0.01 å. the structure of human
108m comt described here and all the published
structures of rat comt have a water molecule
bound in this surface pocket, as k+ was not present
during their crystallization.8,10–12
sam, mg2+, and the inhibitor dnc all bind in
shallow clefts on the protein surface (fig. 1). sam
interacts with conserved motifs along the first half of
the core beta-sheet ( xxxg836xxx –beta4). e90 (beta2) forms hydrogen
bonds with the ribose hydroxyl groups of sam

fig. 2. sam-binding site. sam is shown in stereo with
a transparent van der waals surface and a ball-and-stick
representation colored by atom type (c, gray; n, blue; o,
red; s, yellow). the side chains of residues that interact
with sam are shown in stick representations with c
atoms colored in cyan for 108v comt, in magenta for
108m comt, and in salmon for rat comt (1vid8) and
other atoms colored by atom type as above. the residues
that interact with sam include three nonconserved
residues, i89, i91, and c95, of human comt that replace m89, m91, and y95 of rat comt. s119 was omitted
for clarity. the figure was made with molscript65 and
raster3d.66

(fig. 2, table 1). the adenine ring of sam forms
hydrogen bonds with the side-chain oxygen atoms
of s119 and q120 of  xxxg835xxx  and van der waals interactions with residues in beta2 (i91),  xxxg838xxx  ( xxxg117xxx , a118),
and the beta4–alpha7 loop (h142, w143) (fig. 2). the
methionine portion of sam is coordinated through
hydrogen bonds with residues in  xxxg832xxx  ( xxxd568xxx , v42),  xxxg833xxx 
(s72), and beta4 ( xxxd141xxx ) and hydrophobic interactions
with m40, v42, g60, y68, and i89. the ce methyl
group of sam is directed toward the substratebinding site and the catechol oxygen atom to be
methylated.
the catechol-binding site is a shallow pocket
defined by m40, l198, y200, and “gatekeeper”
residues w38 and p174, which form van der waals
contacts with dnc and hold the substrate in the
correct orientation for methylation (fig. 3). mg2+, a
necessary co-factor for the methylation reaction,1 is
octahedrally coordinated in the active site by the
side chains of  xxxd141xxx ,  xxxd169xxx , n170, the two hydroxyl
groups of the catechol substrate, and a water molecule trans to n170 (fig. 3b, table 1). mg2+ has been
found in the active sites of all the crystal structures
of rat comt.8–12
the crystal structures of human 108v comt and
rat comt [protein data bank (pdb) code 1vid8]
superpose with a calpha rmsd of 0.4 å. this similarity
is not surprising, considering the high sequence
identity of the two proteins and the conservation of
key residues within the binding sites for sam (e90,
 xxxd141xxx , k144) and catechol (w38, p174, e199, y200)
substrates. however, there are several notable
differences between the active sites of rat comt

crystal structures of human 108v and 108m comt

and human comt. three residues in the sambinding site of the human protein (i89, i91, c95)
replace larger residues (m89, m91, y95) that interact
more closely with sam in the rat protein (fig. 2,
table 1). additionally, the outer lip of the catecholbinding site contains two charge substitutions (r201
and e202 in humans to m201 and k202 in rats) that,
while not involving residues that interact directly
with the substrate, could affect vmax as well as
substrate binding and release (fig. 3b). as mentioned above, the km values for catechol substrates
are generally higher in the rat protein.21 the mg2+–
ligand distances in the models for human comt are
shorter than those for rat comt (table 2), but the
difference is probably below the resolution of the
structures.
human comt contains seven cysteine residues,
three of which (c95, c173, c188) are not
conserved in the rat enzyme (y95, v173, s188)
(fig. 4). c95 is situated in the sam-binding site,
∼ 4 å from the ribose hydroxyl groups of sam, while
c173 is positioned next to the p174 “gatekeeper”
residue in the catechol-binding site. all seven
cysteine residues probably exist as free thiol groups
in vivo, and, in the crystal structure, no two of their
sulfur atoms are close enough to each other to form
an intramolecular disulfide bond. however, under
nonreducing conditions, comt migrates as a dimer
and a higher molecular weight species on polyacrylamide gels.58,61,68 in addition, c33, c69, c95, c157,
and c173 of the comt apoprotein all readily interact
with glutathione and iodoacetamides.58,69 the human
crystal structure reveals that c157, c173, c188, and, to
a lesser extent, c95 are located in surface loops
with their sulfur atoms exposed to solvent, making
them potential sites for intermolecular disulfide bond
formation. sam partially protects c69 and c95

e202 is seen in two conformations. figures were made with (a) ucsf chimera64 and (b) molscript65 and raster3d.66

against labeling by 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein, consistent with their locations in the sam-binding site.69
of the cysteine residues reported to undergo
labeling by iodoacetamide, only c33 is completely
buried in the structure of the comt holoprotein.
c33a mutations in rat comt and human comt
completely abolish methyltransferase activity,2,61
while a c33s mutation has little or no effect.58 in
addition, yao et al.68 found that c33 can be covalently modified by the substrate 4-hydroxyequilenin, inhibiting protein activity. c33, located in
helix  xxxg831xxx , forms an sg–od1 hydrogen bond with
 xxxd568xxx  and is buried by side-chain contacts with i29,
 xxxd568xxx , and y200.  xxxd568xxx  (nd2) in turn forms a hydrogen
bond with the  xxxg1641xxx  of sam, while y200 is located in
the catechol-binding pocket. active-site rearrangement and opening of the apoprotein to allow
substrate binding and release could expose c33,
allowing it to become modified. the c33s mutation

would probably maintain both the hydrogen bond
with  xxxd568xxx  and the hydrophobic interactions around
residue 33. in contrast, the c33a mutation would
remove the c33 sg– xxxd568xxx  nd2 hydrogen bond,
possibly affecting the structure of the sam-binding
site.

the crystal structures of human 108v comt and
108m comt are superposable with an overall calpha
rmsd of 0.2 å. plots of the calpha atom b values follow
very similar patterns in the two proteins (fig. 5a).
however, the mean magnitude of all the b values for
108m comt was about half that for the 108v
protein, consistent with the superior diffraction
quality of the 108m comt crystals (table 2). the

catechol-binding sites are virtually identical (figs. 2
and 3, table 1). there are very few structural differences overall between the two human holoproteins.
however, intramolecular packing deviations are
present in the vicinity of the polymorphic residue.
residue 108 is located in a surface loop between
helix  xxxg834xxx  and strand  xxxg838xxx , both of which have sambinding residues at their distal ends (e90, i91, and
c95 on  xxxg834xxx ; a118, s119, and q120 on  xxxg838xxx ) (fig. 1).
v108 is completely buried within a hydrophobic
pocket defined by residues in  xxxg831xxx  (a22),  xxxg833xxx  (a73,
v74, a77,  xxxd333xxx ),  xxxg834xxx  (v103, a106), and beta4 ( xxxd110xxx ,

both proteins, m108 forms closer contacts with a22,
 xxxd333xxx , v103, and a106 (fig. 6, table 3). these closer
contacts result in a 0.7-å displacement between the
calpha atoms of residues m108 and v108 (fig. 6b), and
the displacement propagates toward the sambinding site as slight deviations in the main-chain
atoms of alpha1 (q7, r8, l14, q15) and  xxxg834xxx  (n92, p93,
r101) (figs. 5b and 6b). interestingly, the calpha atom
displacements between the 108v and 108m comt
structures (fig. 5b) are not correlated with the b
values for the calpha atoms (fig. 5a). the calpha atom b
values peak for residues in  xxxg831xxx  (q35, k36), the  xxxg833xxx –beta2
loop (s81–k85), the  xxxg835xxx –beta4 loop (k127– xxxd133xxx ), and

structures, whereas the 108v and 108m backbone
structures differ mainly in alpha1,  xxxg834xxx , and alpha7. in addition, the mean b value for residue 108 is relatively
low in both comt structures. these observations
indicate that the slight differences in the structures
of 108v comt and 108m comt probably do not
result from uncertainties in the data but are instead
attributable to differing interactions of residues
v108 and m108 with their surroundings in the polymorphic site.
in principle, variations in the crystallization conditions could cause differences between the 108v
and 108m structures. 108m comt was crystallized
at ph 7.5, close to the enzyme's ph optimum of 8.0,7
while 108v comt was crystallized at ph 10.5. the
crystal structures of rat comt that have been used
to develop comt inhibitors were obtained at ph 5.5
( xxxd1257xxx , 1jr4) and ph 6.5 (2cl5). however, the salt
bridges and hydrogen bonding involving ionizable
residues appear to be well conserved between the
108v and 108m structures. with the exception of
k111, all the nitrogen atoms of lysine and arginine
side chains that are within 3.5 å of a protein oxygen
atom in the 108m comt structure are located

126
similarly in 108v comt. the side chain of k111 is
oriented somewhat differently, as might be expected
considering its proximity to the polymorphic site
(fig. 6). with the exception of the surface residue
h16, there also appears to be no difference in the
hydrogen bonding of histidine side-chain nitrogen
atoms. a rotation of the imidazole ring in 108m
comt puts ne2 of h16 in a position to form a
hydrogen bond to the backbone o atom of  xxxg1956xxx . the
difference in ph therefore seems unlikely to have
contributed significantly to the structural differences
seen between 108v comt and 108m comt.
because sam stabilizes both the enzymatic activity and the secondary and tertiary structures of
108m comt against heat and chemical denaturants,50,62 it is likely that the bound sam in the
crystal structures, and possibly the dnc, might
restrict the conformational changes caused by the
polymorphism at residue 108. however, the differences in the backbone structures of helices alpha1,  xxxg834xxx ,
and alpha7 may provide clues as to how small displacements at the polymorphic site propagate through
the protein. md simulations of 108v comt and
108m comt have shown that, in the absence of
sam, structural differences at the polymorphic site
spread throughout the protein, becoming especially
pronounced in the region of the catalytic site.49 at
both 25 and 37 °c, residues in the sam-binding site
were more exposed to the solvent in 108m comt
than in the 108v protein. adding sam reduced the
structural differences between 108v comt and
108m comt in the simulations, in accord with the
similarity of the crystal structures described here.
structural studies of the apoproteins will be needed
in order to elucidate more fully the structural differences between 108v comt and 108m comt.
the ability of bound substrates to constrain the
structures of polymorphic methyltransferases has
also been reported for  xxxg2319xxx  ( xxxg2319xxx )70 and  xxxg1066xxx 
( xxxg1066xxx ),71,72 which have sam-binding domains
that are structurally similar to the binding domain of
comt.  xxxg2319xxx  has 23 known single nucleotide polymorphisms, including an alanine/threonine substitution at position 154 in the sam-binding site and a
tyrosine/cysteine substitution at position 240 in the
final beta-strand. both the a154t and y240c polymorphisms destabilize  xxxg2319xxx , decreasing its protein
and activity levels relative to that of the wild-type
protein.73,74 in addition, the y240c mutation decreases the midpoint temperature (tm) for thermal
inactivation of  xxxg2319xxx  from 50 to 39 °c.70,75 sam
protects the catalytic activity of y240c  xxxg2319xxx  but
has no stabilizing effect on the a154t active-site
variant.73,74 these observations suggest that sam
can restrict structural differences that originate distal
from the active site but has little effect on polymorphisms that directly disrupt the sam-binding site.
 xxxg1066xxx  has a common threonine/isoleucine polymorphism at residue 105, which, interestingly, is
located in a position that is virtually identical to that
of residue 108 in comt. replacing t105 with isoleucine results in lower enzymatic activity, dec-

reased levels of immunoreactive protein in vivo, and
higher km values for both sam and histamine.3,71,76
as in comt, md simulations of the 105i and 105t
 xxxg1066xxx  apoproteins showed large structural and
dynamic differences between the sam-binding sites
of the two variants.77 however, the crystal structures of 105t and 105i hnmts71,72 with bound
s- xxxd3157xxx  differ by a calpha rmsd of
only 0.4 å overall, and residue 105 interacts with the
same residues in both variants. the structural similarity of the two variants parallels our finding for
108m comt and 108v comt and is most likely a
result of s- xxxd3157xxx  binding.

materials and methods
reagents
sam ( xxxd1526xxx  salt), dnc, and dl-dithiothreitol (dtt) were purchased from sigma-aldrich.
expression and purification of comt
cloning of human comt, introduction of the v108m
mutation and a c-terminal  xxxd2282xxx  tag, expression in
escherichia coli, and initial purification using talon®
metal affinity resin (clontech) have been described.58
eluted fractions from the talon® column were equilibrated in 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 8, 200 mm nacl, and
10 mm  xxxd26xxx . the histidine tag was cleaved
using biotin-tagged thrombin (thrombin cleavage capture kit, novagen) and the thrombin was removed via
streptavidin agarose. comt was further purified by sizeexclusion chromatography on an xk-16/100 superdex 75
preparation-grade chromatography column (amersham
biosciences) in buffer containing 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 8,
200 mm nacl, and 10 mm dtt. the purified protein was
dialyzed into 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.5, 50 mm nacl,
2 mm mgcl2, and 10 mm dtt and concentrated to a final
concentration of 3 mg/ml.
crystallization
solutions of comt containing 3 mg protein/ml, 50 mm
tris–hcl, ph 7.5, 50 mm nacl, 2 mm mgcl2, 10 mm dtt,
50 mm sam, and 50 mm dnc were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature prior to all crystallization trials. protein
solutions were screened with wizard i and ii sparse
matrix macromolecule crystallization screens (emerald
biosystems) using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. a cluster of rodlike crystals of 108v comt grew at
room temperature in 0.1 m caps, ph 10.5, 0.2 m li2so4,
and 1.2 m nah2po4/0.8 m k2hpo4. crystals of 108m
comt were obtained at 4 °c in solutions containing
0.1 m hepes, ph 7.5, and 70% methyl-2,4-pentanediol
(mpd). paraffin oil was used as a cryoprotectant during
data collection.
data collection
x-ray diffraction data for the 108v comt crystals were
collected at 100 k on an in-house rigaku r-axis iv++
imaging plate system using a wavelength of 1.54 å. the

127

crystal structures of human 108v and 108m comt
108m comt data were collected at 100 k using the x-ray
operations and research beamline 23-id-d (wavelength =
1.22 å) and a mar300 detector at the argonne national
laboratory advanced photon source. the diffraction data
were processed and scaled with the hkl2000 program,78
and the crystals were indexed in space group p212121.
data processing statistics are given in table 2. the minimum d spacing is given as the nominal resolution, but the
incompleteness of the data sets makes the effective resolution less than this. the completeness drops below 80% at
about 2.2 å for the 108v comt data set and at about
1.45 å for the 108m comt data set.

refinement and geometry (molprobity84) statistics for the
second 108v comt structure. the structural differences
between the final models for the two polymorphs (fig. 6)
indicate that refinement against the 108v diffraction data
provides an independent model for this protein.
protein data bank accession numbers
the final coordinates have been deposited in the research collaboratory for structural bioinformatics pdb85
with accession numbers 3bwm and 3bwy for 108v
comt and 108m comt, respectively.

structure solution and refinement
an initial structure of 108v comt was solved by molecular replacement (molrep79), using the 2-å crystal
structure of rat comt (pdb code 1h1d8) stripped of its
sam, inhibitor, mg2+, and solvent molecules as a search
model. during refinement, we used all the reflections
available in the 108v comt data set out to 1.98-å resolution. the structure was refined using refmac5,80 with
rigid-body refinement and then restrained refinement
with riding hydrogen atoms. restraints were applied to
sam and dnc, but not to mg2+, during the refinement.
graphical evaluation of the model and electron density
maps was carried out with xtalview.81 residues 2–215
were resolved in the asymmetric unit. seven residues
(n11, e18, i54, t88, l153, e190, e202) had density present
for two conformations. one molecule each of sam and
dnc and one atom each of mg2+ and k+ were located in
the difference density maps. k+ and mg2+ were identified
on the basis of their electron densities, the candidate
species in the crystallization solution (mg2+, na+, li+, k+,
cl−, and water), the number and identities of nearby
ligands, and the ion–ligand distances. none of the observed distances differed significantly from the mean
length of that metal–ligand bond in high-resolution protein structures from the pdb.82,83 the rwork and rfree
values were 0.189 and 0.245, respectively.
the refined structure of human 108v comt served as
the initial phasing model for the isomorphous 108m
comt crystal. refinement used all the reflections available in the 108m comt data set out to 1.30-å resolution
and was completed using refmac5 with babinet scaling,
anisotropic atomic displacement parameters, and hydrogen atoms added in their riding positions.80 the final
structural model contained one molecule each of sam and
dnc, three molecules of mpd, and one mg2+. nine
residues (e18, q23, q35, i54, t88,  xxxd110xxx , l153, r201, e202)
had density present for two conformations. the final rwork
and rfree values were 0.124 and 0.167, respectively.
refinement and geometry (molprobity84) statistics are
given in table 2.
several side chains adopted different orientations in
the models of the two proteins. to determine if these differences were real, we generated a second structure for 108v
comt using the 1.30-å structure of 108m comt for the
initial phasing. the structure was refined by refmac5 as
before. the test set of reflections used for calculating rfree
consisted of all the reflections with d spacings between 50
and 1.98 å in the test set used for 108m comt. (the test
set for 108m comt included additional reflections with
smaller d spacings.) this procedure resulted in a final value
for rwork of 0.175 and for rfree of 0.225, and the addition of
77 more water molecules. the seven residues that had
density for two conformations in the first structure for
108v comt also did so in the second. table 2 gives the
