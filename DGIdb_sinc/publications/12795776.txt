summary

objective: to determine the relative b1-selectivity
of three b-blockers ( xxxd2704xxx , bisoprolol and
atenolol), administered orally at normal therapeutic doses, by assessing their impact on the
b2-mediated, haemodynamic and biochemical
responses to a terbutaline infusion, which decreases serum potassium and increases serum glucose
and insulin.
methods: twenty-four healthy volunteers (14 men,
10 women), with no history of respiratory disease,
attended on five separate occasions; b-blockers
( xxxd2704xxx  5 mg, bisoprolol 10 mg, atenolol 50 and
100 mg) or placebo were supplied in random order.
three baseline blood samples were collected at
65–85 min post-b-blocker. a 60-min terbutaline
infusion was started 90 min after taking the
b-blocker. blood samples were taken and blood
pressure and heart rate recorded at 15 min intervals
up to 30-min post-infusion. blood samples were
analysed for serum potassium, glucose and insulin
concentrations.
results: terbutaline increased heart rate. pretreatment with  xxxd2704xxx  caused a modest and
non-significant reduction in terbutaline-induced
tachycardia whilst bisoprolol produced a more
marked effect. atenolol at both 50 and 100 mg
doses caused a highly significant reduction in
terbutaline-induced tachycardia. all active preparations had a comparable impact on the terbutaline-induced increase in systolic blood
pressure, but the drugs had no impact on the
changes produced in diastolic blood pressure.
after pretreatment with placebo, the terbutaline
infusion caused a significant decrease in serum
potassium and increases in serum glucose and

insulin. pretreatment with  xxxd2704xxx  had no
discernible effect on potassium compared with
placebo. in contrast, when compared with either
placebo or  xxxd2704xxx , bisoprolol (p < 0æ01) and
both doses of atenolol (p < 0æ001) significantly
attenuated the hypokalaemic effect of terbutaline.
treatment with  xxxd2704xxx  and bisoprolol modestly but significantly reduced the terbutalineinduced increases in glucose (p < 0æ05). the
blocking effects of both doses of atenolol were
highly significant (p < 0æ001) when compared
with placebo and also significant (p < 0æ05 and
p < 0æ01, respectively) when compared with
 xxxd2704xxx  and bisoprolol. a similar pattern of
responses with the different b-blocker treatments
was observed for the effects on insulin concentrations during the terbutaline infusion.
conclusion: the b1-selectivity of three different
b1-blockers has been demonstrated in healthy
volunteers using the blocking of biochemical and
haemodynamic responses to a b2 stimulus. terbutaline alone caused an increase in heart rate, a
rise in systolic blood pressure, a fall in serum
potassium and a rise in both serum glucose and
insulin. in this study, for both haemodynamic
and biochemical responses, atenolol 100 mg had
the greatest b2-blocking effect,  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg the
least. bisoprolol 10 mg and atenolol 50 mg had
intermediate effects; bisoprolol was the more
b1-selective of these two.

introduction

b-blockers are used extensively in clinical practice to
treat patients with hypertension (1, 2), coronary
artery disease (cad) (3) and more recently, heart
failure (4–6). these can be considered as different
stages in the patients’ progress from developing
cad to dying from its consequences. heart failure

may be seen as the end stage, a condition that
severely reduces exercise capacity, causes distressing dyspnoea and has a high mortality rate (7). until
relatively recently treatment was only symptomatic.
then the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
(ace i) were shown to improve the patients’ prognosis (8). more recently b-blockers in addition to ace
inhibitors were shown to further reduce both the
morbidity and the mortality of these patients. in the
largest of these trials, there were marked reductions
in cardiovascular mortality (26–37%) and in particular the incidence of sudden death (40–42%) (4, 5).
in order to be effective however, any treatment
must be well tolerated by patients, many of whom are
elderly and incapacitated by their disease. in the case
of b-blockers this means limiting the adverse effects
most of which are caused by blocking b2-receptors.
b2-blockade may cause severe and often life-threatening asthma attacks in susceptible patients, constrict the medium sized arteries and reduce the
availability of the energy sources, glucose and free
 xxxd2154xxx . limiting these effects may be achieved by
giving a b-blocker selective for the b1-receptor, and
by maintaining low plasma concentrations of the
drug, because there is some loss of selectivity at
higher plasma concentrations.
in the past, the b1-selectivity of b-blockers
was determined by assessing their effect on airway responses in asthmatic individuals given a
b2-agonist (9). such tests (designed to demonstrate a
lack of impact on b2-mediated bronchodilation)
however, are difficult to perform. they are not
reproducible as standard measurements of bronchial patency (peak flow rate and forced expiratory
volume), are very dependent on individual subject’s technique, and the amount of effort they exert
during the procedure. in addition, b-blockers may
cause severe, potentially fatal bronchoconstriction.
further, giving a number of different b-blockers
to compare their relative b1-selectivities would
repeatedly expose these patients to risks and it
would be difficult to achieve sufficiently small
interstudy variability to make meaningful comparisons possible. an alternative, more simple and
reproducible method of determining b1-selectivity
was therefore needed. b2 agonists, such as terbutaline, also promote the mobilization of glucose into
the circulation (causing a rise in serum glucose),
increase serum insulin concentrations and drive
potassium into cells (resulting in a fall in serum

potassium) (10, 11). the extent to which b-blockers
counteract these processes (compared with the
effects of a placebo) can be used as a measure of their
b2-blocking properties and hence, their lack of
b1-selectivity (12).
previous studies have successfully used a terbutaline-based method to demonstrate the b1-selectivity of several b-blockers, propranolol, atenolol
and metoprolol (12, 13). these studies have demonstrated that the technique is easy to perform,
reproducible, and fairly accurate (10).
atenolol is a well-known b1-selective b-blocker,
which has been used very extensively worldwide.
bisoprolol is thought to be highly b1-selective and
was the drug used in the studies in heart failure
called cibis and cibis ii (4).  xxxd2704xxx  is a relatively
lipophilic b1-selective blocker that causes vasodilatation by activation of the l-arginine ⁄  xxxd2738xxx 
pathway, as can be demonstrated by blocking its
effect with  xxxd3291xxx , a  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor (14). it has recently been shown to reverse
endothelial dysfunction (a predictor of future cardiovascular events) in patients with essential
hypertension (15). the b1-selectivity of  xxxd2704xxx  has
been determined primarily in animal models (16).
evidence of its b1-selectivity in man is limited and
derived from the observation that the dose of the
b2-agonist, salbutamol, required to produce bronchodilation is less in those pretreated with  xxxd2704xxx 
than with atenolol or propranolol (17). it is also
derived from studies on the impact of  xxxd2704xxx  on
 xxxd2398xxx -induced increases in heart rate (18).
 xxxd2704xxx  has less effect than a non-selective
b-blocker, which would theoretically reduce both b1
and b2-mediated increases in heart rates.
this study aimed to investigate the relative
b1-selectivity of three b1-selective blockers, haemodynamic and at normal therapeutic doses, by
demonstrating biochemical responses to b2-blockade after a b2-selective stimulus. the study was
approved by the south birmingham local research
ethics committee and all volunteers gave written
informed consent.

methods

volunteer recruitment
twenty-four healthy volunteers (14 male, 10 female)
aged 18–29 years (mean age ± sd 22æ6 ± 2æ5 years)

were recruited. health was defined as an absence
of major medical or surgical illness in the previous
5 years, no hospital admissions and no current
medications (except the oral contraceptive pill).
a full medical history was taken and physical
examination performed at an initial screening visit
specifically to exclude those with a history of
asthma or bronchospasm. subjects were of normal
height (range 1æ60–1æ91 m, mean 1æ73 ± 0æ1 m) and
weight (range 51–95 kg, mean 70æ1 ± 12 kg), with a
moderate alcohol intake (16æ9 ± 10 units ⁄ week).
plan of investigation
volunteers attended the clinical investigation
unit, queen elizabeth hospital at 8 a.m. in a fasted
state on five occasions, not <3 days apart. an
outline of the study plan is presented in fig. 1.
after an initial rest, blood pressure and heart rate
were recorded. volunteers were then given a single
dose of the study medication with 50 ml cold
water. the five study medications ( xxxd2704xxx  5 mg,
bisoprolol 10 mg, atenolol 50 or 100 mg, and placebo) were given double-blind in random order.
the doses of drug were chosen as the standard
therapeutic doses for each agent; those which have
comparable blood pressure lowering effects
(19, 20). subjects remained in a semirecumbent
position for the duration of the study. an intravenous cannula was inserted into a suitable forearm vein for regular blood sampling and a second
cannula was inserted into the contralateral arm for
infusion of the b2-agonist terbutaline. volunteers
then rested undisturbed for 1 h. three baseline

181

blood samples were taken 10 min apart (65, 75 and
85 min after administration of drug). terbutaline
(6 lg ⁄ kg) was then infused over 1 h starting at
90 min post-dosing. heart rate and blood pressure
were measured 15 min before administration of the
terbutaline infusion and at 15–min intervals thereafter until 30 min after the infusion had finished.
blood samples, at 15-min intervals throughout the
study, were taken into plain tubes and allowed to
clot at room temperature. they were then centrifuged at 3500 · g, 4 c for 15 min, separated into
aliquots and stored at ) 80 c until they were analysed for serum potassium, glucose and insulin.
methods of analysis
blood pressure and heart rate were recorded, as the
mean of three recordings, at each time point using an
automated blood pressure monitor (711 omron
automatic is, supplied by white medical, rugby, uk).
serum potassium concentrations were determined by ion selective electrode analysis (ilab
instruments, gmbh, kirchheim, germany). serum
glucose was measured by automated spectrophotometry (cobas-bio autoanalyser, roche diagnostics ltd, basle, switzerland) using the enzyme
hexokinase (bio-stat diagnostic systems, stockport,
cheshire, uk), and serum insulin concentrations
were analysed by elisa (mercodia, ab, uppsala,
sweden). coefficients of variation for all biochemical
analyses were < 3% and < 5% for intra- and interassay variability, respectively. the analyses were
carried out by a technician unaware of the treatments given.

statistical analysis

biochemical parameters

statistical differences between treatments at each
time point, and assessment of change from baseline
within each treatment group were determined by
repeated measures analysis of variance (anova)
with bonferoni’s multiple test analysis. the level of
significance was taken to be p < 0æ05.

serum potassium concentrations. the time course of
the changes in serum potassium concentrations
during and immediately after the terbutaline infusion is shown in fig. 2. at the time of the maximum hypokalaemic effect of terbutaline (i.e. at the
end of the 60-min infusion), pretreatment with
 xxxd2704xxx  had no discernible effect (fig. 3). in
contrast, when compared with either placebo or
 xxxd2704xxx , bisoprolol (p < 0æ01) and both doses of
atenolol (p < 0æ001) significantly attenuated the
hypokalaemic effect of terbutaline.

results

haemodynamic profile
the results for blood pressure and heart rate are
presented in table 1.
by comparison with pretreatment values, at the
end of the 60-min terbutaline infusion (150 min
post-dosing) heart rates were significantly
increased on all treatments (p < 0æ001, table 1).
pretreatment with  xxxd2704xxx  caused a modest and
non-significant reduction in terbutaline-induced
tachycardia whilst bisoprolol produced a more
marked effect. atenolol at both 50 and 100 mg
doses caused a highly significant reduction in terbutaline-induced tachycardia.
the four active preparations had a modest
impact on the terbutaline-induced increase in
systolic blood pressure (table 1). no significant
changes in diastolic blood pressure were observed
(data not shown).

serum glucose and insulin concentrations. after
placebo, a 1-h terbutaline infusion increased
serum glucose concentrations by approximately
1æ3 mmol ⁄ l (fig. 4a). treatment with  xxxd2704xxx 
and bisoprolol treatment modestly but significantly
reduced this effect (p < 0æ05). as can be seen from
fig. 4a, the blocking effects of both doses of
atenolol were highly significant (p < 0æ001) when
compared with placebo and also significant
(p < 0æ01 and p < 0æ05, respectively) when compared with  xxxd2704xxx  and bisoprolol.
similar responses were observed in change in
insulin concentrations during the terbutaline infusion (fig. 4b). in contrast to the other treatments
however, treatment with  xxxd2704xxx  had little impact
on the response to terbutaline.

discussion

in this study, when the volunteers were pretreated
with placebo, terbutaline, by stimulating b2 receptors, caused an increase in heart rate, a rise in
systolic blood pressure, a fall in serum potassium
and a rise in both serum glucose and insulin. the
extent to which each of the four active preparations
counteracted these changes, the method used in
this study to demonstrate b2-blocking activity, was
fairly consistent. for each of the responses (both
haemodynamic and biochemical) atenolol 100 mg
had the greatest b2-blocking effect,  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg
the least. bisoprolol 10 mg and atenolol 50 mg had
intermediate effects; bisoprolol was the more
b1-selective of these two. no significant differences
were observed in baseline haemodynamic or biochemical parameters between treatments suggesting no carry-over of b-blocking effects between
study days.
all the b-blockers studied are considered to be
relatively b1-selective. it should therefore be noted

that their impact on terbutaline-induced responses
were documented over a period of 90–150 min
post-dosing, at a time when oral administration of
the b-blockers would be producing peak plasma
concentrations. as it is known that selective drugs
tend to lose their selectivity at high plasma concentrations our studies were intentionally designed
to allow us to demonstrate differences between
drugs at a time (1–3 h post-dosing) when the
b2-blocking actions were expected to be most

evident. the loss of selectivity at higher plasma
concentrations was further emphasized by the
greater b2-blocking effects of atenolol 100 mg as
compared with atenolol 50 mg.
the fall in serum potassium in response to terbutaline appears to be the most useful measure of
b2 activity (12). potassium is easy to measure and
not influenced by the mental state of the volunteers
or the actions of the member of staff performing the
study. it does require care in taking the blood
sample to prevent haemolysis and we made every
effort to minimize any perturbation of the blood at
the time the sample was collected and during it’s
processing. these measures allowed us to document the fall in potassium as a method for demonstrating the differences in selectivity most
effectively.
the haemodynamic changes observed with all
active preparations during the terbutaline infusion
may be of interest but the differences observed
were small. b2-receptors are also present in the
heart and when stimulated by b2-agonists, such as
terbutaline, cause increases in heart rate (21). using
the terbutaline model, it would therefore be expected that the more selective b1-blockers would
have less effect on terbutaline-induced tachycardia.
although we have positively demonstrated this in
our study, our results must be interpreted with
some caution. effects on blood pressure and heart
rate have proved in previous studies of this kind to
be of limited value and difficult to interpret
because of influences at both the b1 and b2 receptors (13).
the terbutaline test, as used in this investigation
is based on three assumptions. these are firstly that
terbutaline is a selective b2 agonist, secondly that
the haemodynamic and biochemical changes
documented are at least predominantly b2-mediated, and thirdly that the doses of the drugs used
are comparable.
it is accepted that terbutaline is a b2-agonist and
this drug is widely used as a bronchodilator in
asthmatic individuals. the b2-selectivity of terbutaline can be derived from studies showing the
b2-mediated effects on heart rate and pulmonary
function in animal models (22). further evidence
may be derived from its haemodynamic and biochemical effects in asthmatic individuals (23), and
significant bronchodilator actions against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction (24).

the metabolic changes are also predominantly
b2-mediated (25). a fall in potassium can be
observed in animal models following the administration of adrenaline. when pretreated with a
selective b2-receptor blocker, adrenaline no longer
caused a fall in potassium (26). increases in glucose
and insulin concentrations are similarly b2-mediated (25). infusion of a b2-agonist causes a rise in
insulin, which could be the result of direct stimulation of b2-receptors on pancreatic cells or in
response to b2-mediated release of glucose. acute
administration of any b2-agonist (by inhalation or
intravenous infusion) also causes a dose-dependent
rise in serum glucose, apparent shortly after
administration and reaching a maximum at 1 h. it
appears therefore, that demonstration of biochemical changes in response to terbutaline after
pretreatment with b1-selective blockers may be a
useful tool to determine their relative b1-selectivity.
the doses of each drug used in this study were
selected on the basis of previous work. studies
have demonstrated that  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg and
atenolol 50 mg are the doses that provide comparable blood pressure lowering effects when
taken orally in hypertensive subjects (19, 27) and
diabetic patients with hypertension (28). higher
doses of both these agents (i.e.  xxxd2704xxx  10 mg and
atenolol 100 mg) have not provided any additional
antihypertensive benefit (27, 29). bisoprolol 10 mg
has been shown to be therapeutically equivalent to
atenolol 50 mg in patients with essential hypertension (30) but has not been directly compared
with  xxxd2704xxx . we chose to study the higher dose
of atenolol (100 mg) in addition to its normal
therapeutic dose (50 mg) in order to assess the
impact of dose responsiveness in our model of
b1-selectivity.
previous studies of the b1-selectivity of  xxxd2704xxx 
have been performed in vitro and in animal models.
the binding affinity of b-blockers to b-receptors
has been determined in isolated cardiovascular and
respiratory preparations (predominantly b1 and
b2 receptors, respectively). the results of these
studies have demonstrated that  xxxd2704xxx  is a very
b1-selective antagonist. in isolated guinea pig right
atrium it produces a dose-dependent inhibition of
the response to  xxxd2398xxx -induced increases
in heart rate but by contrast had only a weak effect
on  xxxd2398xxx -induced b2-mediated relaxation
of the trachea (31). using the same study design,

comparison of b1-selectivity

 xxxd2704xxx  demonstrated greater b1-selectivity compared with other agents (carvedilol,  xxxd458xxx  and
bisoprolol) (16). in experiments on anaesthetized
dogs,  xxxd2704xxx  significantly inhibited isoprenalineinduced changes in haemodynamic responses at
doses that did not inhibit b2-mediated increases in
biochemical parameters in response to  xxxd2398xxx 
(e.g. glucose, insulin and lactate). these studies
confirmed the b1-selectivity of  xxxd2704xxx  as compared with atenolol and propranolol (32).
there are few in vivo studies of the b1-selectivity
of  xxxd2704xxx  in man. mohammed et al. (17)
assessed the airways response after treatment with
 xxxd2704xxx  but only in six healthy male subjects and
found that it was a more b1-selective blocker than
atenolol (non-significant) or propranolol. their
results were of limited value however, as doses of
atenolol (100 mg) and  xxxd2704xxx  (5 mg) were not
therapeutically comparable and propranolol is a
non-selective agent. in a separate, but again smaller study, van bortel et al. (18) assessed the impact
of  xxxd2704xxx  on  xxxd2398xxx -induced changes in
heart rate.  xxxd2398xxx , a non-selective b-receptor
stimulant, causes these effects as a result of both
the direct stimulation of the b1-receptor and also
via sympathetic stimulation in response to peripheral vasodilatation, as a consequence of b2 stimulation (33). they also found that  xxxd2704xxx  was
selective at the b1-receptor, but in their study not
statistically different from similar therapeutic
doses of atenolol. this may have been due to the
small sample size and greater variability in outcomes. these human studies, designed to assess
b1-selectivity, were able to distinguish between
selective and non-selective b-blockers, but were not
capable of determining the relative selectivity of
different b1-selective agents.
our results are based on a relatively large
number of healthy volunteers studied double-blind
using a method which is precise and reproducible
enough to demonstrate relative selectivity of different b1-selective b-blockers.
conclusions

the potential benefits of using b1-selective blockers
are widely accepted (34). they are associated with
improved patient tolerability and compliance. it is
therefore desirable to be able to assess b1-selectivity
in a safe and reproducible way. drugs that can be

185

shown to be effective at low plasma concentrations
and which can provide a prolonged therapeutic
response should prove particularly acceptable.
they may provide a cardioprotective effect in those
frequently denied b-blockers, such as patients who
are elderly, diabetics, patients with heart failure
and those with reduced respiratory function (35).
in this study, in which three b1-selective b-blockers
were compared,  xxxd2704xxx  was the most selective,
bisoprolol somewhat less selective, and atenolol
