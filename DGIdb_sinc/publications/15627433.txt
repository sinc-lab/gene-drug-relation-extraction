abstract
 xxxd1910xxx  hydrochloride (dpp) is used clinically as an antihistamine drug, but its neurobiological effects are not completely
understood. voltammetry and microdialysis were used to investigate potential actions of dpp on the dopamine system. voltammetric
monitoring of dopamine signals in mouse nucleus accumbens slices showed that dpp (10 am) markedly inhibited dopamine uptake. there
was a 20-fold increase in apparent k m for dopamine uptake, while v max was unchanged. microdialysis experiments demonstrated that dpp (5
mg/kg, i.p.) elevated extracellular dopamine levels (~200%) in mouse nucleus accumbens. dpp (5 and 10 mg/kg) also induced locomotor
activation. all of the effects of dpp were comparable with those of cocaine. taken together, these results indicate that dpp acts as a
competitive  xxxg2149xxx  inhibitor similar to cocaine.

1. introduction
elevations in brain histamine levels are implicated in
arousal mechanisms which contribute to wakefulness and
increased locomotion (mochizuki et al., 1992; philippu and
prast, 2001). classic  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists are
known to exert significant sedative effects. in humans,
these drugs produce measurable decrements in psychomotor performance and impair visual information processing
(kay, 2000). these side effects limit the clinical usefulness
of these compounds as antiallergy drugs. there are several
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, including  xxxd1910xxx  hydrochloride (dpp), which have a chemical structure similar to
 xxxg2149xxx  (dat) inhibitors (e. g. benztropine)

and therefore could potentially inhibit dopamine uptake by
the dat (farnebo et al., 1970). this mechanism of action
of antihistaminergic drugs may lead to new pharmacological uses. for example, such compounds may be effective
as antiparkinsonian drugs (farnebo et al., 1970; ohno et
al., 2001). the ability of dpp to alter endogenous
dopamine uptake has not previously been evaluated. dat
inhibitors are known to elevate striatal extracellular
dopamine levels and this effect is associated with behavioral hyperactivity (budygin et al., 2000; sabeti et al.,
2002; garris et al., 2003; heusner et al., 2003). at the
present time, it is unclear if dpp has any activating
properties which may modify the sedative effects induced
by  xxxg1078xxx  blockade.
the goal of the present study was to evaluate the ability
of dpp, an  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist, to inhibit dopamine
uptake and to induce an increase in extracellular dopamine
levels in the nucleus accumbens in vivo. in addition, the
effect of dpp on locomotor activity was studied. for
comparison purposes, the effects of cocaine, a known dat
inhibitor, were also assessed.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
c57bl/6 mice (jackson laboratories, bar harbor,
maine) were housed in groups of three to four per cage
with food and water ad libitum, and they were on a 12-h
light–dark cycle. experiments were performed in male and
female mice (8–12 weeks old). experimental protocols
adhered to national institutes of health animal care
guidelines and were approved by the wake forest university institutional animal care and use committee.
2.2. fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in brain slices
mice were sacrificed by decapitation and the brains
rapidly removed and cooled in ice-cold, pre-oxygenated
(95% o2/5% co2), modified kreb’s buffer. the tissue was
then sectioned into 400-am-thick coronal slices containing
the nucleus accumbens with a vibrating tissue slicer (leica
vt1000s, leica instruments, wetzlar, germany). slices
were kept in a reservoir of oxygenated kreb’s buffer at room
temperature until required. thirty minutes before each
experiment, a brain slice was transferred to a submersion
recording chamber, perfused at 1 ml/min with 34 8c
oxygenated kreb’s, and allowed to equilibrate. dopamine
release was evoked by single, rectangular, electrical pulses
(300 aa, 2 ms/phase, biphasic). dopamine was detected
using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry as described earlier
(phillips et al., 2003). measured time courses of extracellular dopamine before and after dpp (10 am) or cocaine
(10 am) were analyzed with a michaelis–menten based set
of kinetic equations (phillips et al., 2003) to determine the
maximal concentration of dopamine released by stimulation
and the kinetics of dopamine uptake (fig. 1).
2.3. surgery for in vivo microdialysis
briefly, mice were anesthetized with 6.5 mg/kg ketamine
and 0.44 mg/kg xylazine, administered in a volume of 20 al/
g. a guide cannula for a cma/7 microdialysis probe (cma/
microdialysis, chelmsford, ma) was implanted into the
nucleus accumbens using coordinates determined from
mouse atlases (slotnick and leonard, 1975; franklin and
paxinos, 1997) and refined by empirical determination
(anterior +1.2, lateral 0.6, ventral 4.2 from bregma).
the guide cannula was anchored and the exposed skull
sealed with a fast drying two-part epoxy (locktite, fastneal,
state college, pa). immediately after dialysis, mice were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the brains were
removed for histological confirmation of probe placement.
2.4. microdialysis
the microdialysis procedure is essentially as described
by mateo et al., 2004, with the following modifications. as

nucleus accumbens core slices. (a) dpp and cocaine do not significant alter

mice were recovering from anesthesia, microdialysis
probes (1 mm membrane length, 0.24 mm o.d.; cuprophane, 6 kda cut-off; cma-7, cma/microdialysis) were
connected to a syringe pump and perfused with artificial
cerebral spinal fluid (csf) at a flow rate of 0.6 al/min.
twenty-four hours later, four baseline samples were
collected at 20-min intervals and analyzed immediately
by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. dialysate samples (5 al) were injected
onto a reverse phase microbore column (1501 mm, c-18
unijet column, bioanalytical systems) for separation,
followed by detection with a glassy carbon electrode
(+0.65 v, bioanalytical systems). the mobile phase
consisted of 25 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm sodium
octanesulfonate, 2 mm edta and 10% acetonitrile (ph
5.8). dpp and cocaine were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
and samples were collected for 2 h.
2.5. locomotor activity testing
locomotor activity was studied using plastic chambers
(43.243.230.5 cm; med associates) equipped with
photosensors spaced 2.5-cm apart along two perpendicular
walls. one count of horizontal activity was registered each
time the subject interrupted a single beam. mice were
habituated for 1 h and dpp (5 or 10 mg/kg), cocaine (6 mg/
kg), or saline was injected. horizontal activity counts were
collected every 5 min for 1 h (fig. 2).

dpp, dopamine levels were elevated 2-fold (195f71%;
pb0.05; n=6), while an equimolar dose of cocaine (6 mg/
kg) induced a 3-fold increase in extracellular dopamine
(305f20%; pb0.05; n=6) (fig. 2a). the peak effect of
cocaine occurred at an earlier time (40 min) than dpp (60–
80 min). the average basal dialysate dopamine level was
0.92f0.18 fmol/al. finally, dpp (5 and 10 mg/kg) dosedependently increased the locomotor activity of mice in the
open field (5586f1537 and 13640f3960 cm/h, respectively; pb0.05; n=6). cocaine induced similar activation
(7563f623 cm/h; pb0.01; n=6) (fig. 2b).

4. discussion

fig. 2. (a) dpp (5 mg/kg) and cocaine (6 mg/kg)-stimulated extracellular
dopamine levels in nucleus accumbens measured by microdialysis. the
drugs were administered intraperitoneally at the end of the last baseline
sample and dopamine levels were measured every 20 min for the next 120
min. dpp and cocaine significantly elevated extracellular dopamine levels
~200% and ~300%, respectively ( pb0.05). the arrow represents when
drugs were administered. data are meanfs.e.m. values from six mice and
are expressed as percent of baseline values. (b) effect of dpp (5 and 10
mg/kg) and cocaine (6 mg/kg) on locomotor activity. mice were injected
intraperitoneally with drugs or saline and horizontal activity was monitored
during 1 h. dpp and cocaine significantly increased locomotor activity
levels. **pb0.01; *pb0.05 between saline and postdrug values, #pb0.05
between effect of dpp (5 mg/kg) and dpp (10 mg/kg). data are
meanfs.e.m. values from six mice.

2.6. statistics
statistical analyses were carried out by a one- and twoway analysis of covariance (anova) and student’s t-test
with graphpad prism (graph pad software, san diego, ca,
usa). the data are presented as meanfs.e.m. the
criterion of significance was set at pb0.05.

3. results
to determine if dpp had the ability to inhibit dopamine
uptake, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to monitor
the effect of 10 am dpp on electrically stimulated
endogenous dopamine dynamics in slices from mouse
nucleus accumbens (fig. 1). the drug induced a 20-fold
increase in apparent k m for dopamine uptake (168f8 vs.
3122f342 nm, pb0.001; n=5). the same concentration of
cocaine had greater effect on this parameter (168f8 vs.
4481f395 nm, pb0.001; n=5). at the same time, evoked
dopamine release was not significantly altered by dpp
(1.72f0.15 vs. 2.40f0.42 am, pn0.05; n=5) or by cocaine
(1.54f0.4 vs. 1.95f0.57 am, pn0.05; n=5). microdialysis
experiments showed that after the administration of 5 mg/kg

dpp ( xxxd1910xxx  or  xxxd1910xxx ) is an antihistamine
used clinically in the treatment of allergies (puhakka et al.,
1977) and parkinson’s disease (ohno et al., 2001), although
its mechanism of action in attenuating parkinson’s symptoms was published as unknown. in 1970, it was found that
dpp (10 am) inhibited the uptake of [3h]-dopamine in
striatal slices and induced a blockade of the accumulation of
a-methyl-noradrenaline in dopamine nerve terminals of the
rat median eminence ex vivo (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p.)
(farnebo et al., 1970). dpp is not the only histamine
antagonist that inhibits da uptake;  xxxd375xxx  and
possibly others have been demonstrated to inhibit the dat
(farnebo et al., 1970). the present study, wherein dopamine
dynamics were monitored with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry
in nucleus accumbens slices of mice, confirms that dpp has
the ability to inhibit dopamine uptake. in addition, the effect
of dpp on endogenous dopamine uptake was kinetically
analyzed. the changes in dopamine uptake were best fit to
an increase in apparent k m for dopamine uptake without any
changes in v max, consistent with competitive inhibition of
the dat. similar results were obtained with cocaine (10
am) in nucleus accumbens slices of mice, corroborating
previous studies in rats (phillips et al., 2003). cocaine was
found to be more potent than dpp in increasing the apparent
k m value for dopamine uptake. similarly, microdialysis
experiments showed that 5 mg/kg dpp elevated accumbal
dopamine levels; however, not to the same magnitude as an
equimolar dose of cocaine (6 mg/kg) (~200% vs. ~300%,
respectively). therefore, the dat-inhibiting effect of dpp is
a robust phenomenon both in vitro and in vivo.
the increase in accumbal dopamine levels produced by
psychostimulant administration is critically important for
producing hyperlocomotor responses in rodents (heusner et
al., 2003). consequently, in view of the results obtained by
fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis, it was
predicted that dpp could be a behavioral stimulant. on
the other hand, since histamine  xxxg1078xxx  blockade
induces locomotor inhibition, any stimulatory effects of
dpp could be masked. to determine if dpp acts primarily
as a stimulant or depressant, horizontal activity following
the drug was monitored. in these experiments, dpp induced

240

g.b. lapa et al. / european journal of pharmacology 506 (2005) 237–240

a marked increase in locomotor activity that was slightly
lower than that induced by equimolar dose of cocaine (6 mg/
kg). this behavioral outcome was consistent with the
dopamine-enhancing properties of dpp.
in conclusion, the data presented here clearly indicates
that dopamine-mediated arousal effects are behaviorally
manifested rather than h1-mediated sedative mechanisms in
the actions of dpp on psychomotor performance. these
attributes of dpp could reduce the sedative side effects;
however, there is a possibility of abuse liability, as with
other dat blockers like cocaine. the present findings
should be considered in the future clinical use of  xxxg1078xxx 
antagonists of analogous chemical structures.
