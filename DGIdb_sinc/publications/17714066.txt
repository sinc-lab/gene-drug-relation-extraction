combined use of ultra-short

in patients with impaired myocardial contractility associated with downregulation of the beta-receptors, compounds inhibiting phosphodiesterase
(pde) 3 may be useful to increase contractility. the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 
has been shown to improve pump-function independent from the beta-receptor
pathway. a simultaneous decrease in ventricular preload and afterload by
vasodilation has led to the term ‘inodilator’. esmolol is the only available
ultra-short acting intravenous beta-blocking agent. due to its half-life of
∼ 9 min, beta-blockade, and thus, heart rate, can easily be titrated. esmolol
appears to be a helpful tool to avoid myocardial ischemia (e.g., in the
perioperative setting). as with all other beta-blockers, it has dose-dependent
negative inotropic effects, and this limits its use in patients with severe heart
failure showing low cardiac output. it seems reasonable that an intravenous
combination of both approaches,  xxxd1998xxx -induced positive inotropy and
esmolol-associated protection from myocardial ischemia, might offer advantages by producing beneficial hemodynamic effects and by compensating
each other’s limitations in a complementary way. in spite of some promising
results, the place of a combination of  xxxd1998xxx  and esmolol in the process
of treating patients with (acute) heart failure showing low output is still not
entirely clear, and needs further confirmation.

introduction

myocardial failure can be characterized by the heart’s limited ability to sustain
adequate organ perfusion and to provide the tissue with substrates. the common
denominator of heart failure, independent of its origin, is the inability of the
myocardium to match the load imposed on it. although heart failure starts with
myocardial dysfunction, many of the manifestations of low-output syndrome result
from peripheral circulatory derangements. the objective in this situation is to
improve overall cardiac function and to provide optimal organ perfusion.
most conventional therapy for managing acute low output failure is based on
alpha-, beta- or dopaminergic receptors. catecholamines are powerful positive inotropic
agents, but their use is limited due to their chronotropic and arrhythmogenic
properties. the positive inotropic response to beta-sympathomimetic agents are
diminished in patients with severe heart failure because of desensitization of
myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors (‘down-regulation’ phenomenon) (figure 1) [1].
in patients in whom beta-blockers are used for treating chronic heart failure,
hypertension or coronary artery disease, catecholamines possess only reduced

positive inotropic efficacy. phosphodiesterase (pde) 3 inhibitors
are alternative therapeutic strategies, as these cardiotonic
compounds counteract the loss of beta-receptor responsiveness.
the complexity of the pathogenesis of acute heart failure
may offer a large number of opportunities for acute pharmacologic interventions. prevention of perioperative myocardial
ischemia represents an important approach to improve
postoperative outcome. beta-blockers seem to be the most
effective regimen in reducing cardiac morbidity and
mortality in non-cardiac and cardiac surgery patients [2,3]. as
catecholamines show reduced positive inotropic effects in
beta-blocked patients, use of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors is an interesting
alternative to improve hemodynamics in beta-blocker patients.

overview of the market

2.1

esmolol (brevibloc®)

beta-blockers prevent catecholamines from binding to beta-receptors
in the myocardium and peripheral arteries. beta-blockers have
antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic and anti-ischemic effects.
beta-blockers inhibit sympathetic outflow centrally, slow heart
rate and reduce the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
activity by inhibiting renin release [4]. acute intravenous
administration of beta-blockers results in significantly decreased
cardiac contractility. compared with other antihypertensives,
beta-blockers have the greatest combined effect on reducing heart
rate and blood pressure [5]. beta-blockers reduce tachyarrhythmias
associated with sudden death. beta-blockers differ with regard
to their pharmacologic properties, including  xxxg836xxx /beta2-adrenergic
receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (isa)
and vasodilatory properties [4] (table 1).
beta-blockers are commonly divided into three generations
of agents. first-generation beta-blockers, such as propranolol,
exert equal blockade of  xxxg836xxx -and beta2-adrenergic receptors, and
are therefore described as nonselective beta-blockers. the secondgeneration exhibits higher affinity binding to  xxxg836xxx -receptors
than to beta2-receptors, and are termed selective beta-blockers.
the extent of selectivity of these agents (e.g., metoprolol,
atenolol, bisoprolol, esmolol) is not absolute and ranges
2136

widely among the agents.  xxxg836xxx -selectivity implies greater
safety in treatment of patients with obstructive pulmonary
disease, diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease
because beta2-agonist effects (bronchodilation, vasodilation) are
presumably maintained. the third-generation beta-blockers
(e.g., carvedilol) are distinguished from the earlier classes
of beta-blockers by their ancillary vasodilating activity. these
agents appear to provide vasodilation primarily through
their blockade of the alpha1-receptor, which contributes to
regulation of endothelial function and vasoconstriction
in peripheral blood vessels.
some  xxxg836xxx -blockers exhibit isa due to partial agonism at
one or more adrenergic receptors. thus, beta-blockers with isa
are capable of both stimulating  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptors and
opposing the transmission of sympathetic nervous system
signalling [4]. this combination of opposing effects has been
shown to attenuate the decreases in heart rate and cardiac
output and increases in peripheral vascular resistance that
are associated with beta-blockade.
all beta-blockers have the potential to exacerbate congestive
heart failure (chf), impair cardiac conduction, reduce blood
pressure and precipitate bronchoconstriction. the development
of these adverse effects may be unpredictable before initiating
beta-blocker therapy, and may result from antagonism of intrinsic
sympathetic tone or direct depression of myocardial function
and of the specialized automatic and conductive tissues.
2.2

 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 

 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors are a heterogenous group of compounds,
which have one common activity: the inhibition of pde
type 3. all  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors act by direct positive inotropy and
peripheral vasodilation (‘inodilators’); all are available only for
intravenous administration: i)  xxxd2341xxx , the first  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitor to be introduced, is now not available in several countries. its inotropic properties have been questioned and its
effects in patients suffering from chf were assumed to result
from peripheral vasodilating effects only [6]. ii) milrinone
(corotrop®), a bypiridine derivative, appears to be 20 – 30 times
more potent than  xxxd2341xxx , but shows less positive inotropic

chemistry of esmolol

esmolol hydrochloride is a  xxxg836xxx -selective adrenergic receptor
blocking agent with a very short duration of action (elimination half-life of 9.2 min). the chemical name for esmolol
hydrochloride is (±)-methyl p-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)
propoxy]hydrocinnamate hydrochloride. esmolol has the
molecular formula c16h26no4ci and a molecular weight of
331.8 daltons. it is a relatively hydrophilic compound
that is very soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol.

chemistry of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 

 xxxd1998xxx  is an imidazolone derivative that selectively
inhibits sr-associated phosphodieserase. an ampule has
20 ml containing 100 mg of  xxxd1998xxx , as well as
 xxxd3034xxx , ethanol and sodium hydroxide.

pharmacodynamics

3.1

esmolol

esmolol is  xxxg836xxx -selective adrenergic-receptor blocker reported
to have no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, vasodilatory
capabilities or significant membrane-stabilizing activity.
in human electrophysiology studies, esmolol produced
effects typical of a beta-blocker; a decrease in the heart rate,
prolongation of the sinus node recovery time during normal
sinus rhythm and during atrial pacing, and an increase in
antegrade wenckebach cycle length. after termination of
infusion, substantial recovery from beta-blockade is observed
in 10 – 20 min. during exercise, esmolol produced reductions
in heart rate, rate pressure product and cardiac index,
which were also similar to those produced by propranolol,
but produced a significantly larger fall in systolic blood
pressure. at 30 min after the discontinuation of esmolol
infusion, all of the hemodynamic parameters had returned
to pretreatment levels.

3.2

 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 

the mechanism of action of pde inhibitors at the cellular
level is based on the ability to inhibit pde, which results in
an increase in intracellular camp [8-10] (figure 2). multiple
forms of pde isoenzymes have been identified [11]. the physiological consequences of inhibition of pde isoenzymes depend
on the concentration of pde in certain tissues as well as on the
selectivity of the pde inhibitor for that isoenzyme fraction.
specific  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors lack significant affinity for adenosine
receptors and central stimulant properties [12].
with the rise in camp by inhibition of pde, protein
kinases are activated to promote phosphorylation of the
sarcoplasmatic reticulum. the increase in camp produces a
net influx of ca++ in the cardiac muscle, resulting in inotropy
and a net outflux of ca++ in vascular smooth muscle, thus
resulting in vasodilation (figure 3). the pharmacological
profile of  xxxd1998xxx  is characterized by an increase in the
force of contraction as well as by a relaxation of vascular
smooth muscles. this results in peripheral vasodilation, by
which end-diastolic wall stress (‘preload’), as well as systolic
wall stress (‘afterload’), are reduced [10,30,34]. the term ‘inodilator’
was coined to describe the dual hemodynamic properties
of these agents.
in contrast with catecholamines, tachyphylaxis is not
present with  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors. klein et al. [13] compared the
effects of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2341xxx  and dobutamine in
patients with chronic heart failure. improvement in cardiac
performance was comparable for both groups; hemodynamics
remained improved throughout the infusion period of 24 h
with  xxxd2341xxx  only.  xxxd1998xxx  is also effective over a
prolonged infusion period.

is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues,
such as the liver, or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow.
esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of ∼ 2 min and an
elimination half-life of 9.2 min. using an appropriate loading
dose, steady-state blood levels of esmolol for dosages from
50 – 300 µg/kg/min are obtained within 5 min. steady-state
is reached in ∼ 30 min without the loading dose. steady-state
blood levels of esmolol increase linearly over this dosage
range and elimination kinetics are dose-independent over
this range. steady-state blood levels are maintained during
2138

infusion, but decrease rapidly after termination of the
infusion. consistent with the high rate of blood-based metabolism of esmolol, < 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged
in the urine. within 24 h of the end of infusion, ∼ 73 – 88%
of the dosage has been accounted for in the urine as the
acid metabolite of esmolol. metabolism of esmolol results in
the formation of the corresponding free acid and methanol.
the acid metabolite has been shown in animals to have
∼ 1/1500th the activity of esmolol, and in normal volunteers
its blood levels do not correspond to the level of beta-blockade.

the acid metabolite has an elimination half-life of ∼ 3.7 h and
is excreted in the urine with a clearance that is approximately
equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate. excretion of the
acid metabolite is significantly decreased in patients with
renal disease, with the elimination half-life increased to
∼ 10-fold that of normal subjects, and plasma levels considerably elevated. esmolol has been shown to be 55% bound
to human plasma protein, whereas the acid metabolite is
only 10% bound.

the mean time to peak drug-effect of  xxxd1998xxx  ranges
from 27 min to 4 h and is dependent on the patient’s disease
(e.g., liver or kidney dysfunction) [14]. duration of action
cannot be definitely predicted and varies widely among
patients with chronic chf, acute hemodynamic decompensation or renal dysfunction. half-life of elimination (t1/2beta)
in healthy volunteers ranged ∼ 1 – 2 h after intravenous
administration, but ranged from 2.9 to 20.0 h in patients
with chf.  xxxd1998xxx  is extensively metabolised in the
liver to active sulphoxide derivatives. these derivatives are
renally excreted, thus dose reduction is recommended in
patients with liver and kidney failure. approximately 85%
of  xxxd1998xxx  is protein-bound.

clinical efficacy

5.1

b-blocker esmolol
supraventricular tachycardia

5.1.1

esmolol is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in
patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative
states and in all emergent circumstances where short-term
control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is
desirable. the efficacy and safety of esmolol was investigated
in 358 patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (svts)
in placebo-controlled, propranolol-controlled or open-label,
baseline-controlled, multi-center studies [15]. the majority of
these patients developed arrhythmias postoperatively. esmolol
was infused in doses ranging from 25 to 300 µg/kg/min.
results revealed that esmolol was superior to placebo and
equal to propranolol in controlling heart rate in patients
with svts. conversion to normal sinus rhythm was
comparable in patients treated with esmolol (14%) and in
those treated with propranolol (16%).
5.1.2

perioperative tachycardia and/or hypertension

fast heart-rate and high blood-pressure are associated with
a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients
with coronary artery disease (cad) and heart failure.
esmolol has been shown to be effective and safe in
attenuating the tachycardia and hypertension seen in various
intra- and postoperative settings. in particular, esmolol was
successfully used to blunt the hyperdynamic hemodynamic
responses to tracheal intubation and extubation, and during
electroconvulsive therapy [16,17].

5.1.3 perioperative myocardial ischemia
and infarction

the perioperative period is known to be stressful, characterized
by complex and rapidly changing physiologic responses that
may be poorly tolerated by patients with a compromised
circulation or poor left ventricular function [18]. during
and after surgery, hypertension, tachycardia and increased
sympathetic activity are common. this affects the balance
between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, predisposing
the vulnerable myocardium to ischemia. thus, cardiac
complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure
and life-threatening dysrhythmias are common in patients
undergoing major noncardiac surgery and represent a major
health and economic issue [18].
previous clinical investigations have demonstrated the
utility of beta-blockade in reducing perioperative ischemic
events, ultimately translating into a decrease in cardiac
morbidity and mortality especially in patients who were at
risk for, or had cad [19-21]. administration of beta-blockers
to all patients at high risk for coronary events who undergo
major noncardiac surgery is strongly supported by a
recently updated clinical guideline of the american college
of cardiology/american heart association [22].
the safety and anti-ischemic efficacy of intra- and postoperative esmolol administration in high-risk surgery patients
has been demonstrated in several clinical studies [23-25]. in a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial, raby et al. [23] described
the anti-ischemic efficacy of esmolol therapy to control individual patient heart rate in a high-risk subset of patients with
documented preoperative ischemia. the authors identified the
minimal heart rate at which preoperative holter monitoring(ambulatory electrocardiography)-detected ischemia occurred,
and then defined a target heart rate as 20% less than the
ischemic threshold (with an absolute minimum of 60/min).
a total of 26 of 150 patients who underwent elective major
vascular surgery were found to have significant myocardial
ischemia as defined by st-segment depression. these patients
were then randomized to receive intravenous esmolol via a
continuous infusion without a starting bolus, beginning at a
dose of 100 µg/kg/min or an intravenous isotonic sodium
chloride solution via a continuous infusion, beginning immediately after surgery and just before arrival in the postanesthesia
care unit. esmolol infusions were well tolerated in all patients
and no patient in this study had beta-blocker therapy suspended
because of unacceptable side effects. the most important
finding of the study, however, was that beta-adrenergic blockade
with esmolol administered to a predefined patient-specific
target heart rate was associated with a significant reduction
and frequent elimination of postoperative myocardial
ischemia. postoperative ischemia occurred in 33% of the
beta-blocker group and 73% of the controls.

altered significantly [1,26]. thus, in patients with severe heart
failure, positive inotropic response to beta-sympathomimetic
agents is diminished owing to a desensitization of myocardial
beta-adrenergic receptors (‘downregulation’ phenomenon). the
degree of downregulation is directly related to the severity of
ventricular dysfunction. fowler et al. [27] investigated patients
with mild-to-moderate and severe ventricular dysfunction and
found reductions of 38 and 57%, respectively. patients with a
left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) of < 30% (severe
heart failure) and < 50% (moderate heart failure) were given
graded sequential infusions of dobutamine. those patients
with severe cardiac dysfunction showed a marked impairment
of the expected response in dp/dtmax and stroke work index.
this proves that reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density
and/or function is related to the severity of heart failure
and can be associated with specific impairment of the
beta-receptor-mediated contractile response to dobutamine.
treatment with catecholamines is also known to induce
desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors, which results in
hyporesponsiveness to further stimulation by sympathomimetic
agents [28] – downregulation developed within 72 h of
initiation of infusion of dobutamine.
particular problems arise in patients with chronic use of
beta-blocker therapy. in these patients, catecholamines often
fail to sufficiently improve pump function. substances with
a mechanism of action located at a site ‘distal’ to the
beta-adrenergic receptor, such as  xxxd1998xxx , may be useful to
treat inotropic abnormalities sufficiently (figure 4) [29].
5.2.1

hemodynamic effects

 xxxd1998xxx  shifts the slope of the peak isovolumetric
pressure–volume relation to the left, indicating enhanced
2140

contractility [30]. improvement in other indices of contractility
(i.e., left ventricular dp/dtmax, ratio of peak systolic pressure
to end-systolic volume) also indicates an increase in inotropy
with this  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor in the clinical setting. in animal
experiments using  xxxd1998xxx  and close control of preloading,
contractility increased by ∼ 66%, whereas systemic vascular
resistance fell by 30 – 50% [30].
 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors also act beneficially on the diastolic
properties by modulating compliance and relaxation [31,32].
the lusitropic action of pde inhibitors is also mediated by
the increase in intracellular camp levels, which is necessary
for energy-dependent relaxation. vasodilatation induced by
 xxxg1695xxx  inhibition may trigger reflex increase in sympathetic
tone, through which the rate of cardiac relaxation and
heart rate may increase secondary to camp accumulation via
beta-adrenoceptor activation. venodilation leads to a decrease
in right ventricular volume, which contributes to a downward
displacement of left ventricular pressure–volume relationship
via ventricular interdependence.
when treating patients with reduced myocardial
performance, it is imperative to use drugs that will improve
ventricular function without jeopardizing an ischemic
myocardium. myocardial oxygen consumption (mvo2)
reflects the sum of both energy-saving (arterial and venous)
vasodilation and energy-consuming (positive inotropic)
effects. administration of  xxxd1998xxx  resulted in an
improvement in myocardial performance, whereas mvo2
remains almost unchanged [34]. the expected increase in
mvo2 secondary to the increase in myocardial contractility
appears to be compensated for by a decrease in ventricular
preload and afterload. the lack of lactate production
reported by weber et al. [34] suggested that myocardial

anaerobiosis was not induced by  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors. by
contrast, the improvement in hemodynamics induced
by dobutamine was associated with an increase in mvo2
(ranging from +30 to +40%) [35].
the beneficial effects of  xxxd1998xxx  are augmented when
beta-receptor agonists are administered simultaneously. by
complementary action,  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors prevent the destruction of camp, whereas catecholamines stimulate camp
production. a synergistic inotropic interaction between
catecholamines and  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors is particularly expected
in patients with severe, pre-existing heart failure. these
patients often show an enhanced beta-adrenergic stimulation
secondary to elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.
the combined action of  xxxd1998xxx  and catecholamines
may explain the drugs’ significant cardiostimulatory effects
in this situation.
5.2.2

electrophysiological effects

patients suffering from severe heart failure often show various
types of dysrhythmias. all inotropic substances are at risk
to cause arrhythmias. the potential pro-arrhythmogenic
activity of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors is mediated by the increase in
intracellular camp levels.  xxxd1998xxx  led to a shortened basic
sinus cycle length, sinus node recovery time and sinuatrial
conduction, whereas atrioventricular atrial refractoriness
decreased, thus resulting in positive chronotropic and
dromotropic effects [36]. aside from these actions on
myocardial automaticity, conduction and refractoriness, the
increase in heart rate, more likely, appears to be caused by
vasodilation-mediated, reflex increase in sympathetic tone.
5.2.3

effects on circulation

an increase in cardiac output is not always identical with
an improvement in organ perfusion. catecholamines, for
example, may improve cardiac output, but effective regional
perfusion may deteriorate. many of the hemodynamic
problems in the critically ill are secondary to a reduced
blood flow to various organs, which promotes further
deterioration of microcirculatory blood flow. the microcirculatory profile of cardiovascular active agents is not
well documented. the effects of  xxxd1998xxx  on organ
function are not well defined. zeplin et al. [37] compared
the effects of dobutamine and  xxxd1998xxx  on renal function
in cardiac surgery patients in the postoperative period.
urine output was significantly higher in the patients
who had received  xxxd1998xxx , and diuretics were more
often necessary in patients who were treated with
dobutamine.  xxxd1998xxx  had beneficial effects on renal
function attributable either to the increase in cardiac
index or to a direct improvement in renal perfusion.
in contrast to dobutamine, treatment with  xxxd1998xxx 
(2.5 – 10.0 µg/kg/min) resulted in increased hepatosplanchnic
oxygen consumption, increased indocaine metabolism and
decreased release of hepatic tnf-alpha in septic shock
patients, indicating improved hepatosplanchnic function and

anti-inflammatory properties [38]. administration of  xxxd1998xxx 
(5 µg/kg/min) that was initiated prior to cardiopulmonary
bypass (cpb) and continued for the following 24 h
diminished endotoxin levels in liver venous blood, indicating
beneficial effects on perfusion, tissue damage and barrier
function of the gut [39].
5.2.4

other effects

the microvasculature is a key battleground for inflammatory
processes, with evidence of a central role for the
endothelium in modulating inflammation. both leukocytes
and endothelial cells express particular adhesion molecules
that are responsible for the cell–cell interactions. by this
cell–cell interplay, trafficking and migration of leukocytes
across the vascular endothelial barrier into tissues is
modulated. in a study in cardiac surgery patients using
cbp, an increased expression of adhesion molecule l-selectin
of more than the double of baseline values was seen after
cpb [40]; this was significantly lower in  xxxd1998xxx -treated
than in non-treated control patients, indicating less endothelial injury in the treated patients. this may be either due
to the reduced inflammatory response (as pro-inflammatory
cytokines induced expression and release of adhesion
molecules) or due to improved (micro) circulation that
attenuates development of tissue hypoxia.
5.3 combination of b-blocker esmolol and
 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 

elevated cyclic nucleotides by  xxxg1695xxx  inhibition of beta-adrenergic
substances may be associated with increased incidence of
dysrhythmias, especially in ischemic tissues or during
reperfusion [41]. by contrast, beta-blockers have been shown
to be of benefit in protecting patients from sudden death
secondary to arrhythmias. they have, however, considerable
negative inotropic properties that may limit their use in
patients who are at risk to develop low output failure. thus,
it seems reasonable that a combination of both approaches
might offer advantages in the critically ill by producing
beneficial hemodynamic effects and by compensating each
other’s limitations in a complementary way [42,43]. the influence
of the prophylactic, prebypass use of a combination of
intravenous beta-blocker esmolol (e) and  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor
 xxxd1998xxx  (e) on postbypass hemodynamics, inflammation
and organ function was assessed in a prospective, randomized,
placebo-controlled study in 42 patients aged > 65 years
undergoing aorto-coronary bypass grafting [44]. in 21 patients,
esmolol (titrated to keep heart rate < 70/min) plus  xxxd1998xxx 
(continuous infusion of 2.5 µg/kg/min) was started after
induction of anesthesia and continued until the morning
of the 1st postoperative day (e+e-group). another 21 patients
received saline solution as placebo. hemodynamics,
splanchnic perfusion, liver function, renal function,
myocardial ischemia, inflammation (figure 5) and endothelial
integrity were assessed at baseline, before and after cpb,
and in the intensive care unit (icu). catecholamine

requirements were significantly lower in the e+e-treated
than in the non-treated patients. heart rate was significantly
lower, cardiac index was higher and splanchnic perfusion

troponin t,  xxxg1403xxx  (beta-nag) and
glutathione transferase-alpha (alpha-gst) increased significantly in
the untreated control, but remained almost normal in the
e+e-treated patients. inflammatory response (plasma levels
of elastase, interleukins, adhesion molecules) were attenuated
by esmolol/ xxxd1998xxx . thus, in comparison with an untreated
control, the use of a combination of esmolol and  xxxd1998xxx 
in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cpb
2142

resulted in overall beneficial effects on postbypass
hemodynamics, organ function, inflammatory response and
endothelial integrity.
 xxxd1998xxx  may increase myocardial oxygen consumption
and may have dysrhythmogenic effects, especially during
myocardial ischemia or reperfusion [45]. as beta-blockers have
important antiarrhythmic properties, and may also reduce
apoptic myocardial cell death [46], a combination of both
substances in this situation may be useful. in elderly cardiac
surgery patients, markers of myocardial ischemia (troponin t,
ck-mb) were significantly less increased in the postbypass
period in e+e-treated patients compared with an untreated

control group [44]. this myocardial protective effect may be
attributed only to the use of esmolol, but  xxxd1998xxx  may
have contributed to this effect by means of mediating an
increased myocardial blood flow.
the beneficial myocardial effects of beta-blocking substances
are most probably explained by a reduction of heart rate.
aside from this cardioprotective effect, beta-blockers may
possess additional cellular effects by inhibition of protein
kinases. by this mechanism, beta-blockers affect endothelin
synthesis, neutrophil chemotaxis, inflammation and nitric
oxide synthesis [47,48].
the organ-protective effects of the combination of beta-blockers and  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors have been confirmed also in a nonsurgical, medical setting: long-term use of beta-blocker carvedilol
and metopropol in patients with chronic heart failure
inhibited the favorable hemodynamic effects of dobutamine,
whereas administration of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx  resulted
in improved hemodynamics in these patients [42,43].

safety and tolerability

6.1

b-blocker esmolol

investigators, or by observation of systolic pressure < 90 mmhg
or diastolic pressure < 50 mmhg. the hypotension was
symptomatic (mainly diaphoresis or dizziness) in ∼ 12% of
patients, and therapy was discontinued in ∼ 11% of
patients: about 50% of whom were symptomatic.
6.1.1 interaction with other cardiovascular
medications

esmolol does not appear to interact with digoxin, morphine,
warfarin or succinylcholine to any clinically important
extent. caution should be exercised when considering the
use of esmolol and verapamil in patients with depressed
myocardial function. fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in
patients receiving both drugs. additionally, esmolol should
not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the
presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic,
such as dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline, because
of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic
vascular resistance is high.
6.2

the safety and tolerability of esmolol has been shown
in specific clinical settings (i.e., in patients with unstable
angina, myocardial ischemia and infarction, atrial fibrillation
or flutter and supraventricular tachycardia). with careful
titration and monitoring of the patient, esmolol is
relatively safe in the management of patients with hypertension or tachyarrhythmias associated with chf or
chronic obstructive lung disease, in whom beta-blockers are
otherwise contraindicated.
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
often do not have a significant bronchospastic component.
cardioselective beta-blockers, beginning at low doses and
titrating upward as tolerated, have cardioprotective effects
in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. thus, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease should not preclude beta-blockers when compelling
indications exist. by contrast, the safety and relative cardioselectivity of esmolol were demonstrated in a double-blind,
randomized, crossover study in ten patients with asthma [49].
increasing doses of esmolol (100, 200, 300 µg/kg/min)
produced no significant increases in specific airway-resistance
compared with placebo. at a dose of 300 µg/kg/min,
esmolol produced slightly enhanced bronchomotor
sensitivity to dry air stimulus. these effects were not
clinically significant, and esmolol was well tolerated by all
patients. six of the patients also received intravenous
propranolol, and at a dosage of 1 mg, and two patients
experienced significant, symptomatic bronchospasm
requiring bronchodilator treatment.
the most frequent adverse effects associated with esmolol
infusion are hypotension and phlebitis. in all studies,
significant decreases of blood pressure occurred in 20 – 50%
of patients, identified either as adverse reaction reports by

 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 

three major risks associated with the intravenous use of
 xxxd1998xxx  are:
– reduction in blood pressure
– increase in heart rate and/or induction of arrhythmias
– increase in mvo2.
patients with cad may be especially sensitive to the possibly
tachycardic and arrhythmogenic properties of  xxxd1998xxx .
aside from hemodynamic side effects and inducing
arrhythmias,  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2341xxx  has been reported
to be associated with significant thrombocytopenia [50].
by contrast,  xxxd1998xxx  has been shown to be safe with
regards to platelet function and in patients showing
increased risk of bleeding [51].  xxxd1998xxx  is contraindicated
in pregnanacy because of possible teratogenic effects.
7.

drug interactions

no relevant drug interactions between esmolol and  xxxd1998xxx 
have been described.  xxxd1998xxx  must be prepared only
in saline solution or aqua injectabile, other solutions
(e.g., dextrose) should not be used because they are
incompatible. it should not be prepared in glass but in
plastic devices.  xxxd1998xxx  must be infused via a seperate
line (preferably via a central venous line), otherwise it will
precipitate.  xxxd1998xxx  does not interact with diuretics,
antiarrhythmics (e,g, lidocaine, diltiazem), anticoagulants
or sedatives [14].
8.

dosing regimens

8.1

b-blocker esmolol

esmolol is infused intravenously in rates ranging from
25 to 300 µg/kg/min, along with a loading dose or bolus.

esmolol and  xxxd1998xxx 

esmolol dosage needs to be titrated, using ventricular rate
as the guide. an initial loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg infused
over a 1 min duration followed by a maintenance infusion
of 50 µg/kg/min for the next 4 min is recommended. after
the 4 min of initial maintenance infusion, depending upon
the desired ventricular response, the maintenance infusion
may be continued at 50 µg/kg/min or increased step-wise
(e.g., 100, 150 to a maximum of 300 µg/kg/min), with each
step being maintained for at least 4 min. if more rapid
slowing of ventricular response is imperative, the 0.5 mg/kg
loading dose infused over a 1 min period may be repeated
twice. maintenance infusions (with or without loading
doses) may be continued for as long as 24 h. the safety of
dosages > 300 µg/kg/min has not been studied. in the event
of an adverse reaction, the dosage of esmolol may be reduced
or discontinued. abrupt cessation of esmolol in patients
has not been reported to produce the withdrawal effects
which may occur with abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockers
following chronic use in cad patients.
the most frequent adverse effect associated with
esmolol infusion is hypotension. adverse effects due to
beta-blockade can be corrected by down-titrating or
discontinuing the infusion, with complete disappearance
of clinical effects in 20 – 30 min.
8.2

 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 

some of the negative effects are dependent on the
administered dose of  xxxd1998xxx .  xxxd1998xxx  is sometimes
started with a loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg i.v. (ranging from
0.5 to 3.0 mg/kg) followed by a continuous infusion
of 2.5 – 5 µg/kg/min (to a maximum of 10 µg/kg/min).
in a randomized study, increasing doses of  xxxd1998xxx 
(2.5, 5.0, 10.0 µg/kg/min) were given to patients with nyha
(new york heart association)-failure class ii – iv: significant
hemodynamic changes were noted at the lowest infusion
rate and did not increase in a linear fashion at higher
infusion rates [53]. increasing the dosage of  xxxd1998xxx  may
result in considerable hypotension which should be
avoided particularly in patients with critical cad. a
reduction in blood pressure can be limited when volume
deficits that result from vasodilation on arterial and
venous sides are treated early and sufficiently. when a
bolus loading dose is used, the rate of injection may also
influence the hemodynamic response to  xxxd1998xxx . rapid
injection (within 1 min) induces severe decrease in blood
pressure, which places the patient at risk of reflex increase
in heart rate or induction of dysrhythmias by reflex
sympathetic stimulation. thus, (rapid) bolus loading dose
should be avoided and a continuous infusion at a slow
rate is recommended.
the dosage of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors has to be adjusted with
regard to renal function. in patients showing elevated serum
creatinine levels,  xxxd1998xxx  must be reduced because of the
growing risk of accumulation of its partly-active metabolite
( xxxd1998xxx  sufoxide).
2144

8.3 combination of b-blocker esmolol and
 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx 

doses of both substances should be titrated according to their
hemodynamic effects. effects of esmolol can be seen within
a few minutes, whereas effects of  xxxd1998xxx  will be seen
within 30 min, when a continuous infusion is used instead
of bolus application. bolus administration of  xxxd1998xxx 
may rapidly decrease blood pressure that subsequently needs
treatment with vasoconstrictors (e.g., noradrenaline).
9.

expert opinion

the pathophysiology of low output syndrome is rarely
limited to an isolated abnormality. it is more likely that
a combination of defects in diastolic and systolic function,
cardiac relaxation and vascular loading is responsible.
pharmacologic interventions aim to influence the most
important aspects of low output failure: heart rate,
contractility and vascular resistance. when patients with
acute heart failure are treated, pathophysiological changes
of beta-adrenoceptor should be taken into account. alternate
approaches to beta-receptor stimulating substances exist and
ought to be part of our therapeutic armamentarium. unlike
the catecholamines that act by stimulating beta-adrenergic
receptors, the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1998xxx  works by
inhibiting  xxxg1695xxx . the expected considerable increase in
mvo2 secondary to increased myocardial contractility
may partly be compensated by a decrease in ventricular
preload and afterload.
inotropic stimulation in patients with heart failure per se
may have deleterious effects, by which clinical benefits of
this therapeutic approach can be lessened or even negated [53].
arrhythmogenicity of all available inotropic substances has
raised especial concern. elevated cyclic nucleotides by  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibition or beta-adrenergic substances may be associated
with increased incidence of dysrhythmias, particularly in
ischemic tissues or during reperfusion. beta-blockers have
been shown to be of significant benefit in protecting
patients from myocardial ischemia and from sudden death.
they are associated with considerable negative inotropic
properties that may limit their use in patients with reduced
myocardial contracility (who are subsequently at risk
to develop low output failure). thus, it seems reasonable that
a combination of both agents,  xxxd1998xxx -induced positive
inotropy and esmolol-induced beta-receptor blockade, might
offer advantages by producing beneficial hemodynamic
effects by compensating limitations of each other in a
complementary manner.
a combined intravenous therapy with the short acting
beta-blocker esmolol and the inodilator  xxxd1998xxx  may be a
promising therapeutic approach for certain patients (e.g., in
those critically ill surgical patients in whom myocardial
protection is necessary but patients simultaneously show
impaired cardiac function, thus needing inotropic support
to maintain sufficient cardic output). compared with a

expert opin. pharmacother. (2007) 8(13)

boldt & suttner

conventional catecholamine-based therapy, early or even
preventive use of this combination has shown to be of benefit
in patients who are at risk of severe low output syndrome [44].
in spite of some promising reports, experiences with using the
esmolol/ xxxd1998xxx  combination are insufficient at present.
we should remember withering (1795): ‘it is now about ten
years since i first began to use this medicine. experience and
cautious attention gradually taught me how to use it. for the
