review

there are now a number of highly effective options for the treatment of hormone-receptor–positive breast
cancer. although tamoxifen was the standard hormonal treatment for many years, we now have another option
for postmenopausal women: the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (ais) anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole.
a number of trials have investigated the use of third-generation ais compared with tamoxifen throughout the
continuum of treatment settings for postmenopausal women with breast cancer. in the neoadjuvant setting, letrozole,
given for 4 months, resulted in better overall clinical response and breast-conserving surgery rates than tamoxifen.
the immediate preoperative anastrozole tamoxifen or combined with tamoxifen trial gave anastrozole for 3 months
with no difference in clinical response but significantly improved breast-conserving surgery rates. compared with
tamoxifen, anastrozole and letrozole significantly improved disease-free survival as early adjuvant treatment for
hormone-receptor–positive disease. switching to anastrozole or exemestane after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen
for a total of 5 years of therapy was also more effective than continued tamoxifen. all three agents are approved in the
early adjuvant or switching setting in the usa. letrozole following 5 years of tamoxifen as extended adjuvant treatment
improved disease-free survival and, in the node-positive subgroup, overall survival when compared with placebo.
anastrozole and letrozole are both approved for the first-line treatment of hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer
in postmenopausal women; letrozole showed an improved response rate compared with tamoxifen. anastrozole,
letrozole and exemestane are all indicated for the second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer. in summary, thirdgeneration ais have been shown to have superior efficacy over tamoxifen in the metastatic, neoadjuvant and adjuvant
settings and to improve outcome as extended adjuvant therapy following 5 years of tamoxifen. ongoing studies will
further define the role of sequential adjuvant treatment. appropriate duration of treatment is another important area of
investigation. this review will cover hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with breast cancer and will not
address the treatment of premenopausal women.

introduction
hormone-receptor (hr) status is an important factor used to
determine the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer. hrpositive (hr+) breast cancer is defined as estrogen-receptor–
positive (er+), progesterone-receptor–positive (pgr+) or both.
a patient with hormone-sensitive breast cancer has hr+
disease, which responds to treatments that specifically block
or interfere with the function of estrogen or progesterone. the
major source of estrogen in premenopausal women is the

ovaries; in postmenopausal women, estrogen arises from the
aromatization of peripheral androgens catalysed by the enzyme
aromatase. the ovaries, adrenal gland and adipose tissue are the
main sources of the peripheral androgens in postmenopausal
women [1, 2].
historically, the first evidence of effective hormonal therapy
for breast cancer was the response of metastatic disease to
ovarian suppression. only about one-third of patients
responded to this therapy, indicating that better identification
of responsive cancers and more specific treatment was needed
[3]. sensitive tumors are now identified by testing for specific
receptors.  xxxg1603xxx  testing is performed on either
paraffin-embedded or frozen tumor tissue with
immunohistochemical (ihc) staining [4, 5]. the degree of
hormone positivity can be scored by a variety of methods; the

the operability of larger tumors. in addition, treatment in the
neoadjuvant setting allows assessment of clinical response,
and it is possible to obtain serial tumor tissue to better
understand determinants of response or resistance to specific
therapies. adjuvant ai therapy following primary surgery with
or without chemotherapy has been tested in a number of
ways: as initial therapy compared with tamoxifen for 5 years,
as sequential therapy following 2–3 years of tamoxifen for
a total of 5 years of hormone treatment, and following 5 years
of tamoxifen as extended adjuvant therapy for 5 additional
years. this review will examine the evolution of hormone
therapy as treatment for postmenopausal women with earlystage breast cancer as part of the continuum of treatment for
hr+ breast cancer.

treatment of hr1 early-stage breast
cancer
neoadjuvant therapy
in hr+ postmenopausal women, neoadjuvant endocrine
therapy is an alternative for larger tumors when chemotherapy
is not possible due to medical contraindications, or when
surgery is delayed for a variety of reasons [18]. in addition,
endocrine therapy may be preferred over chemotherapy for
older women with tumors that are strongly hr+. the results of
a comparison of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (four cycles of
doxorubicin and paclitaxel) with neoadjuvant hormonal
therapy (either anastrozole or exemestane for 3 months) in
postmenopausal women with hr+ breast cancers showed
similar clinical and pathologic complete response rates between
the chemotherapy and hormonal therapy arms [19].
significantly more patients were rendered eligible for breastconserving therapy in the hormonal therapy arm (34%)
compared with the chemotherapy arm (24%) [20].
chemotherapy was associated with expected side effects such as
grade iii/iv alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhea and cardiotoxicity,
while hormonal therapy was better tolerated, with the most
common adverse events being hot flushes, vaginal discharge
and musculoskeletal disorders [19]. retrospective evaluation of
patients in a variety of clinical trials have suggested that hr+
tumors may be less likely to respond to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy [21], with very low rates of complete pathologic
response. it is possible that neoadjuvant hormonal therapy
offers an advantage over chemotherapy for hormone-sensitive
tumors. at the present time, this should be considered as an
important treatment option for older women with strongly
hr+ tumors for whom neoadjuvant therapy is planned. in the
future, genomic analysis should allow differentiation of
hormone-sensitive tumors that do not require chemotherapy
from those that should be treated with chemotherapy
preferentially.
in two separate randomized clinical trials, 4 months or
3 months of neoadjuvant letrozole (po24) or anastrozole (the
immediate preoperative anastrozole tamoxifen or combined
with tamoxifen [impact] trial), respectively, improved the
rate of patients receiving breast-conserving surgery compared
with the same duration of therapy with tamoxifen. after
4 months of letrozole or tamoxifen, patients receiving letrozole

best validated system is the allred score. the allred score
combines a proportion score (ps) with an intensity score (is)
to arrive at a total score for receptor positivity (ts, range 0–8).
the ps reflects the estimated proportion of positive tumor
cells on the entire slide (range 0–5). the is reflects the average
staining intensity of positive tumor cells (range 0–3) [6].
however, due to ease of interpretation, the majority of
laboratories report results as positive or negative, with
a percentage of positive cells and the degree of intensity of
staining. central retesting has demonstrated that at least
a modest percentage of results from ihc may be false negatives;
negative testing that does not correlate with the biologic
features of a tumor should be repeated [7, 8]. studies to date
have not determined a definitive connection between the
relative degree of receptor positivity and response to hormone
therapy, although clearly, minimally receptor-positive tumors
have a lower chance of response [6]. approximately 75% of
breast cancers are er+ and 55% are pgr+ [9, 10]. endocrine
therapy is indicated as part of adjuvant treatment for these
tumors [11].
treatment of established cancers depends on menopausal
status. the estrogen pathway can be targeted through either
receptor blockade, reduction of circulating estrogen levels in
premenopausal women or suppression of estrogen synthesis in
the tissues in postmenopausal women. ovarian ablation alone
or in combination with endocrine manipulation is an effective
therapy for premenopausal women [12]. although levels of
circulating estradiol are about 10-fold lower in postmenopausal
women than in premenopausal women, tissue estradiol levels
are elevated due to conversion of weak androgens to estrogens
via the aromatase enzyme [2], and are sufficient to support the
growth of hormone-sensitive tumors. targeting the estrogen
pathway is a highly effective therapy for the most common type
of breast cancer, and there are several agents now available
(table 1).
tamoxifen is a selective er modulator (serm) with both
antagonistic and agonistic er effects [13, 14]. at least part of
the determination of effect is organ-based. in the breast,
tamoxifen inhibits estrogen activity. however, tamoxifen has
estrogen-like activity in the uterus and bone, resulting in
endometrial hyperplasia and an increased risk of endometrial
cancer, as well as preservation of bone mineral density in
postmenopausal women [15, 16]. despite the significant and
durable efficacy of tamoxifen, it is this variability that also
limits the benefits of tamoxifen as a treatment for breast cancer
and contributes to its short-term side effects. aromatase
inhibitors (ais), including anastrozole, letrozole and
exemestane, selectively inhibit enzymatic aromatase activity
in peripheral tissues responsible for estrogen synthesis in
postmenopausal women. anastrozole and letrozole are
nonsteroidal inhibitors, and exemestane is a steroidal inhibitor
with a different binding site on the aromatase enzyme.
 xxxd2165xxx , a pure er antagonist without partial agonist
activity, results in a significant reduction in cellular levels of
the  xxxg730xxx  [17].
several different approaches comparing ais with tamoxifen
to treat early-stage breast cancer have been evaluated.
neoadjuvant therapy is given prior to surgery to reduce tumor
load and improve the chances of breast-conserving surgery and

had a significantly higher rate of breast-conserving surgery,
45% versus 35%, respectively (p = 0.022) [22]. similar results
were reported in the impact trial in patients who were
initially deemed ineligible for breast-conserving surgery. after
3 months of treatment, 46% of anastrozole patients became
eligible for breast-conserving surgery, compared with 22.2%
of patients receiving tamoxifen (p = 0.03) [23]. a recent report
of a small (n = 151) randomized trial investigating exemestane
in the neoadjuvant setting also found exemestane to be more
effective than tamoxifen in terms of rate of clinical overall
response (exemestane 76.3% vs tamoxifen 40%; p = 0.05) and
breast-conserving surgery (exemestane 36.8% vs tamoxifen
20%; p = 0.05) [24].
overall response (or) is an important and clinically relevant
end point in patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment due to
the strong correlation of pathologic response and long-term
outcome in chemotherapy trials [25]. in these neoadjuvant
trials, clinical response was the primary end point. pathologic
response was not reported. clinical or did not differ
significantly in patients receiving 3 months of anastrozole
compared with tamoxifen in two neoadjuvant trials [23, 26]. in
contrast, treatment with letrozole for 4 months resulted in
significant superior or compared with tamoxifen [22, 27].

initial tumor size did not affect response rates; response was
improved in both large and small tumors [22]. it may be that
the duration of therapy influences the response to hormone
therapy. data from trials testing ais as neoadjuvant therapy for
breast cancer are summarized in table 2.
there is great interest in understanding the factors that may
contribute to tamoxifen resistance or, more importantly,
improved response to ais. two areas of interest are the relative
intensity of er and coexpression of other receptors that may
lead to tamoxifen resistance. in an analysis of response rates
based on degree of er positivity using the allred score,
treatment with letrozole resulted in consistently higher
response rates compared with tamoxifen in patients whose
tumors had low er scores [27]. in addition, a subset analysis
demonstrated that letrozole was also significantly more effective
than tamoxifen (or 88% vs 21%; p = 0.0004) in er+ patients
whose tumors were found to have gene amplification for two
factors linked to endocrine-therapy resistance, human
 xxxg682xxx -2 ( xxxg721xxx  [ xxxg682xxx -2]) and
human  xxxg682xxx -1 (her-1,  xxxg682xxx -1 or

and found that treatment with anastrozole resulted in higher
response rates compared with tamoxifen in this high-risk
population. interestingly, subsequent studies have indicated
that the presence of her2/neu receptor overexpression is likely
associated with relative resistance to at least most forms of
hormone therapy, and that the growth stimulatory effects of the
her2 pathway overcome the effects of therapy directed to the
er. further evaluation of the p024 neoadjuvant trial data
indicated no real difference in suppression of proliferation as
measured by ki67 when comparing tamoxifen to letrozole in
her2 amplified tumors [29]. data from the transatac
group, described below, supports the overall worse outcome in
this group of patients with early stage disease regardless of
hormone therapy.

early (or initial) adjuvant therapy
the american society of clinical oncology (asco) guidelines
(technology assessment on the use of aromatase inhibitors as
adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone
receptor-positive breast cancer) were updated based on the
results of several large adjuvant trials, outlined in table 3. these
guidelines, published in early 2005, state that optimal adjuvant
hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with hr+
disease should include an ai either as initial therapy or
following a course of tamoxifen [30]. the arimidex, tamoxifen
alone or in combination (atac) trial was the first to show
that the ai anastrozole was more effective than tamoxifen as
initial adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer [31–33].
this double-blind trial originally randomized 9366
postmenopausal women with er/pgr+ or unknown receptor
status breast cancer to 5 years of anastrozole, tamoxifen or
a combination. the primary end point was disease-free survival
(dfs), defined as the time to the earliest occurrence of local or
distant recurrence, new primary breast cancer or death from
any cause. eighty-four percent of patients were hr+ and 8%
were hr–, while in 8% of patients the receptor status was
unknown. sixty-five percent of patients had node-negative
breast cancer and 22% received adjuvant chemotherapy [31].

months, dfs in patients enrolled on the combination arm was
found to be similar to that of tamoxifen alone, while treatment
with anastrozole resulted in improved results. subsequently,
the combination arm of the atac trial was closed. the 6421
patients enrolled in the single-agent arms remained blinded and
continued to be analysed for the primary and secondary end
points. after a median follow-up of 68 months, anastrozole was
associated with a 13% relative improvement in dfs over
tamoxifen (p = 0.01) and a 21% relative risk reduction in time
to recurrence (ttr) (p = 0.0005) [33]. this effect was greater
in the hr+ subset, with a 17% improvement in dfs (p =
0.005) and a 26% risk reduction in ttr (p = 0.0002). a
significant relative reduction in the risk of distant recurrence in
the intent-to-treat (itt) population (14%; p = 0.04) was
observed, although the reduction in the hr+ population was
not statistically significant (p = 0.06) [33]. anastrozole reduced
the incidence of new contralateral breast cancer in all patients
(risk reduction 42%; p = 0.01) and in hr+ patients (risk
reduction 53%; p = 0.001). in a subset analysis, anastrozole did
not provide a significant advantage in terms of dfs for women
with node-positive disease or for those treated with adjuvant
chemotherapy.
a more recent analysis investigating the use of different
chemotherapeutic regimens used in the atac trial again
showed no significant benefit for anastrozole over tamoxifen in
these patients regardless of type of regimen [34]. at 68 months
of median follow-up, there was no overall survival difference
for either the itt or hr+ populations (hazard ratio 0.93; p =
0.7) [33]. with respect to safety, patients taking anastrozole
experienced an increased incidence of fractures, osteoporosis
and musculoskeletal problems, while they experienced fewer
gynecological problems and vascular events than those taking
tamoxifen [33]. the incidence of hypercholesterolemia was
higher in patients receiving anastrozole than in patients
receiving tamoxifen (9% vs 3%; p <0.0001, respectively), and
patients receiving anastrozole also had a slightly higher
incidence of ischemic cardiovascular disease (4.1% vs 3.4%; p =
0.1) [33, 35].
a retrospective analysis of patients randomized on the
atac trial initially suggested that a subset of patients may
particularly benefit from the use of ais as adjuvant therapy

tamoxifen, reducing the overall relative risk of recurrence by
19% (p = 0.003). initial treatment with letrozole also
significantly reduced the relative risk of distant metastases in
hr+ tumors (27% reduction; p = 0.0012). interestingly,
prospectively planned subset analysis of the big 1-98 data
revealed different information compared with atac. a
significant improvement in dfs was observed in patients with
node-positive disease as well as in patients who had received
adjuvant chemotherapy. in addition, letrozole was superior to
tamoxifen in all hr subsets, with an improvement in dfs in
er+/pgr+ and er+/pgr– tumors. as was done in atac,
hr status was determined locally, so the validity of both subset
analyses has been questioned in terms of their value in
establishing a population with relative hormone resistance
based on receptor status. central confirmation of receptor
status was performed by the big and these data were recently
presented [39], demonstrating benefit of letrozole over
tamoxifen in the two hr+ subsets irrespective of pgr and
her-2 status. patients with  xxxg721xxx –positive disease
experienced a worse dfs than those with her-2–negative
tumors. at the current period of follow-up there was no
significant difference in overall survival between the two
groups (hazard ratio = 0.86; 95% confidence interval [ci] =
0.70–1.06; p = 0.16) [38].
side effects in the big 1-98 trial were largely as expected and
similar to those reported in the atac trial. elevation of
cholesterol was listed as an event in 43% of patients taking
letrozole versus 19% of those taking tamoxifen. however, more
than 80% of elevations were grade 1 or mild, and cholesterol
levels remained relatively stable in patients taking letrozole,
whereas treatment with tamoxifen resulted in a 12% overall
reduction, suggesting that the observed difference between
letrozole and tamoxifen in hypercholesterolemia in big 1-98
may be due to the lipid-lowering effects of tamoxifen. in
comparison with tamoxifen, patients treated with letrozole had
less vaginal bleeding and fewer thromboembolic complications.
conversely, letrozole increased the incidence of bone
fractures and arthralgia compared with tamoxifen. grade 3–5
cardiovascular events were reported in 3.7% versus 4.2% of the
patients in the letrozole arm versus the tamoxifen arm,
respectively, but grade 3–5 cardiac events were slightly but
significantly more frequent in the letrozole arm (2.1% vs 1.1%,
respectively; p = 0.0003) [38]. this degree of detail in grade
of toxicity was not provided for either atac or the intergroup
exemestane study (ies).

switching adjuvant therapy
the development of resistance to tamoxifen, as well as its
toxicity over time, limit its effectiveness and lead to preclinical
data suggesting a possible benefit of switching from tamoxifen
to an ai partway through tamoxifen therapy to decrease the
risk of recurrence [40, 41]. two of the ais, exemestane and
anastrozole, have been studied in this context; these data are
summarized in table 4 [42]. the ies [43, 44] compared
switching to exemestane after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen with
tamoxifen alone, for a total of 5 years of endocrine treatment in
4742 women with early-stage breast cancer. the primary end
point, dfs, was defined as the time from randomization to
recurrence of breast cancer at any site, diagnosis of a second

[36]; patients reported to have er+/pgr– tumors experienced
a statistically significantly improvement in dfs from treatment
with anastrozole. however, the transatac group recently
presented a central analysis of estrogen and progesterone
receptors in a subset of patients enrolled in atac, and found
no difference in the dfs benefit of anastrozole over tamoxifen
based on pgr status (all patients hazard ratio [hr] 0.72,
er+/pgr+ hr 0.72, er+/pgr– hr 0.66). in addition,
 xxxg721xxx  positivity was associated with a shorter time to
relapse for both tamoxifen (p = 0.001) and anastrozole
(p <0.0001) [37].
the breast international group (big) 1-98 trial [38] is the
only study that is designed to compare initial adjuvant therapy
with either an ai or tamoxifen with sequential use of both
agents for a total duration of 5 years. this double-blind,
randomized, phase iii study was initially started by novartis in
1998 as a two-arm study called the femara–tamoxifen trial.
the sequencing arms were then added when the international
breast cancer study group (ibcsg, a subgroup of the big)
took over the scientific integrity, operations and logistics of
what then was renamed big 1-98. the primary end point, dfs,
is defined as events occurring from the time of randomization
to the time of either recurrence of the primary breast cancer
at any local, regional or distant site, development of a new
primary invasive breast cancer in the contralateral breast,
development of any second primary cancer except basal or
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or death from any cause.
unlike the atac study, the dfs end point in big 1-98 also
includes secondary cancers. in this double-blind study,
postmenopausal women with er+ or pgr+ early-stage breast
cancer were randomized to receive monotherapy with either
letrozole or tamoxifen for 5 years or sequential administration
of tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years, or
letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years
(figure 1). the primary core analysis of 8010 patients included
patients enrolled in all four arms of the trial, censoring
patients in the sequential arms within 30 days of the 2-year
switch, and was recently published [38]. forty-one percent of
patients had node-positive disease, and 25% received
adjuvant chemotherapy. hr positivity was a requirement for
study entry; 99.8% of patients had receptor-positive tumors.
after a median follow-up of 25.8 months, with more than
1200 patients followed for at least 5 years, treatment with
letrozole resulted in superior dfs than did treatment with

women receiving tamoxifen for 2 years (n = 3123) were
randomized to continue with tamoxifen for a total of 5 years.
although originally not planned together, the studies were
combined despite small differences in entry criteria. all patients
in the trials were hr+, 27% were node-positive, and no
patients in the study received prior chemotherapy. the primary
end point was event-free survival (efs). switching to
anastrozole resulted in significantly improved efs compared
with the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio = 0.60; p = 0.0009) and
significantly better distant recurrence-free survival (hazard
ratio = 0.61; p = 0.0067); the advantage of switching to
anastrozole versus continuing with tamoxifen therapy was
independent of nodal status [45]. there was no difference in
overall survival at 28 months of follow-up, although there were
a limited number of events for survival assessment (59 deaths
on tamoxifen and 45 deaths on anastrozole). the incidence
of prespecified adverse events was low, but there were
significantly more fractures in the anastrozole group compared
with the group continuing on tamoxifen (2% vs 1%).
interestingly, there were no differences in the incidence of
gynecologic adverse events.
the italian tamoxifen arimidex (ita) trial [46] is a small,
randomized, open-label study of er+, lymph node-positive,
postmenopausal women, of whom approximately 45% had
prior adjuvant chemotherapy. in this study 448 women who
had received tamoxifen for 2 or more years went on to receive
continued tamoxifen or anastrozole for a total of 5 years of
treatment. at a median follow-up of 36 months, patients
receiving anastrozole had a significant improvement in dfs
compared with those continuing on tamoxifen (hazard ratio =
0.35; p = 0.001) but experienced more adverse events (203 vs
150, respectively; p = 0.04). however, patients receiving
tamoxifen had significantly more serious adverse events (33 of
150 events vs 28 of 203 events; p = 0.04). the trial was not able
to look at other end points such as the risk of distant metastases
and the variability of time on tamoxifen before the switch
(median 28 months; range, 20–40 months), and the open-label

primary breast cancer or death from any cause. eighty-five
percent of women were er+ and 12% had unknown er status;
patients were declared ineligible if their tumors were known
to be er– [43]. at a median follow-up of 56 months, the switch
to exemestane significantly improved dfs compared with 5
years of tamoxifen alone (hazard ratio = 0.75; p = 0.0001),
corresponding to an absolute benefit of 3.5% at 5 years in the
er+/unknown population [44]. in these patients, changing to
exemestane significantly reduced the relative risk of
contralateral breast cancer by 44% (hazard ratio = 0.56; p =
0.04) and improved breast cancer-free survival (hazard ratio =
0.75; p = 0.00005) as well as survival free of distant disease. at
the most recent update of this trial, there was a borderline
overall survival benefit in the hormone-receptor–positive or
unknown group (hazard ratio = 0.83; p = 0.05) when compared
with tamoxifen [44]. subgroup analysis revealed a benefit from
the switch in all subgroups, including in er+/pgr+ vs er+/
pgr–, node-positive versus node-negative and patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.
the overall side-effect profile following the switch was
similar to that seen in atac and big 1-98; there was a higher
rate of osteoporosis (9.2 vs 7.2%, p = 0.01) and fracture (7%
vs 4.9%; p = 0.003) in patients on the exemestane arm.
although the initial report of these data suggested that
pretreatment with tamoxifen could have a protective effect on
bone, this effect was lost with further follow-up. patients on
the exemestane arm also had a slightly higher risk of myocardial
infarction (1.3% vs 0.8%; p = 0.08) [44]. when patients
actually on medication were analysed, the difference in the
number of myocardial infarctions occurring in patients on
exemestane compared to those on tamoxifen was insignificant
(0.6% vs 0.2%; p = 0.06) [44]. the difference in cardiovascular
events seen when all ais are compared with tamoxifen may
be due to a cardioprotective effect of tamoxifen and needs to
be evaluated with longer follow-up.

tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting based on the data from the
neoadjuvant studies described above) and may clarify
differences between response based on pgr status, although this
may require genomic analysis. finally, data from the sequential
arms of the big 1-98 trial will help determine the optimal time
to introduce an ai. this trial is particularly important, as
patients are randomized to either switching or receiving
therapy from the start at diagnosis, rather than after 2–3 years
of treatment with tamoxifen, which of course eliminates those
who relapse early. the team trial has more inherent variability
due to differences in study design between the participating
centers, but will also provide additional data on the switching
approach compared to up-front therapy.

extended adjuvant therapy
hr+ early-stage breast cancer is a chronic disease, with half of
the recurrences and over half of the deaths occurring after
completion of 5 years of tamoxifen therapy [11]. this ongoing
risk of recurrence varies by stage at diagnosis [49]. the
national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project (nsabp)
b-14 trial demonstrated that extending adjuvant tamoxifen to
10 years resulted in a worsening of dfs compared with 5 years
of tamoxifen due to competing morbidities and the probable
development of resistance to tamoxifen over time [40]. ma.17
was the first study to demonstrate the benefit of an ai
(letrozole) as extended adjuvant hormone treatment after
5 years of tamoxifen [50, 51]. in this trial, postmenopausal
women (n = 5187) with hr+ early-stage breast cancer who
were disease-free following 4–6 years of adjuvant tamoxifen
were randomized to receive letrozole or placebo for
5 additional years as extended adjuvant therapy. unlike the
trials outlined above, women did not have to be
postmenopausal at diagnosis; those who became amenorrheic
during chemotherapy or tamoxifen treatment were allowed
into the study. almost one-half of patients enrolled in the trial
had node-positive disease (45.3% of letrozole patients and 46%
of placebo patients), and about half of the patients received
adjuvant chemotherapy (45.6% of letrozole patients and 45.1%
of placebo patients). the primary end point was dfs, defined
as the time from randomization to the recurrence of the
primary disease or the development of a new primary breast
cancer in the contralateral breast. this trial was unblinded early
in october 2003, following the prospectively planned first
interim analysis at a median follow-up of 2.4 years, due to
highly significant differences in outcomes between the letrozole
and placebo groups [50]. in the final analysis, at 2.5 years
median follow-up, letrozole was associated with significantly
improved dfs, defined as recurrence or a contralateral breast
cancer (hazard ratio = 0.58; 95% ci = 0.45–0.75; p < 0.001)
[51]. letrozole also significantly reduced the risk of distant
metastases (hazard ratio = 0.60; 95% ci = 0.43–0.84; p = 0.002).
there was no difference in overall survival between groups
(hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% ci = 0.57–1.19), but a survival
advantage was observed in the node-positive subgroup (hazard
ratio = 0.61; 95% ci 0.38–0.98; p = 0.04), making letrozole
the first ai to demonstrate a significant improvement in
survival in early breast cancer. the occurrence of
hypercholesterolemia (16% vs 16%; p = 0.79) and

design limits further analyses. switching to anastrozole was
associated with less gynecological toxicity and fewer venous
disorders when compared with tamoxifen, but lipid
metabolism disorders were more frequent with anastrozole
[46]. although this trial reported a benefit from switching to an
ai after about 2.5 years of tamoxifen, the larger ies and
abcsg/arno 8 trials have significantly more robust data sets
due to patient number as well as study design.
two ongoing trials are expected to provide further
clarification of optimal adjuvant hormonal regimens for
postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. the
tamoxifen–exemestane adjuvant multicenter trial (team),
which began in 2001, is comparing 5 years of exemestane
treatment with 5 years of tamoxifen treatment as adjuvant
hormone therapy in early-stage disease. results from the ies,
which showed that switching from tamoxifen to exemestane
after 2 to 3 years improves dfs over tamoxifen treatment
alone, prompted an amendment to the team trial design to
include a similar switch (figure 2) [47]. in addition, analysis of
the sequential adjuvant arms of big 1-98, in which 2 years of
letrozole treatment is followed by 3 years of tamoxifen
treatment or vice versa (figure 1) [37], will provide crucial
comparative data on the benefit of sequencing letrozole and
tamoxifen compared with front-line therapy and will also
clarify optimal sequencing strategies. results from the
switching arms of big 1-98 trial are expected in 2008.
data from all of the switching trials have demonstrated
increased benefit for patients with hr+ disease who switch to
an ai after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen compared with
those continuing on a total of 5 years of tamoxifen therapy [43–
46]. currently, the decision on whether to start with an ai or to
start with tamoxifen and switch to an ai later on is a subject of
great debate. the greatest risk of recurrence for hr+ breast
cancer is in the first 2–3 years following surgery [48]. while this
may reflect general hormone resistance, it has been suggested as
a reason to start with an ai rather than with tamoxifen,
especially in the patient population at increased risk for
recurrence (e.g., patients with node-positive disease). however,
it may be that sequencing tamoxifen and ais retains the
benefits of both classes of agents and optimizes outcome in
disease that is hormone-sensitive. future studies and ongoing
analysis of patient tumor samples from the atac and big 1-98
trials will analyse specific phenotypes to better understand
whether particular risk groups are best treated with one
approach rather than another (e.g., treatment of  xxxg721xxx –
positive, hr-positive disease with ais rather than with

results from the abcsg 6a trial investigating extended
adjuvant therapy with anastrozole were recently reported [54].
in this open-label study, postmenopausal women with nodepositive disease who had received tamoxifen in combination
with  xxxd147xxx  (n = 406) or tamoxifen alone (n = 450)
were re-randomized to switch to anastrozole (1 mg/day) or no
treatment for an additional 3 years. at 5-year follow-up,
significantly fewer patients in the anastrozole group
experienced disease recurrence compared with the placebo
group (30 vs 56 patients; hazard ratio = 0.64; p = 0.047), but
there was no statistically significant difference in survival
between the two groups. these are the first data showing
efficacy of anastrozole as an extended adjuvant therapy, but
conclusions must be drawn carefully, because this was a small,
open-label trial with unbalanced arms, and no safety results are
presently reported.
the other large extended therapy trial, nsabp b-33, which
compared exemestane with placebo for an additional 5 years of
treatment following 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen, was
closed early when the results of ma.17 were reported in 2003
[55]. at the time of study unblinding, 1598 patients out of the
planned 3000 had been enrolled; 72% continued exemestane,
and 44% of patients taking placebo changed to exemestane.
with a median follow-up of only 30 months, and despite the
crossover, extended adjuvant therapy with exemestane in b-33
resulted in a borderline improvement in dfs (relative risk =
0.68; p = 0.07) and a significant improvement in relapse-free
survival (relative risk = 0.44; p = 0.004) [54]. data from these
three trials are summarized in table 5.
the 2006 breast cancer guidelines of the national
comprehensive cancer network (nccn) suggest that
adjuvant hormonal therapy for hr+ postmenopausal women
with tamoxifen alone should be limited to women in whom ais
are contraindicated or to those who decline treatment with ais.
otherwise, the use of ais is recommended in the early adjuvant
(anastrozole or letrozole), sequential adjuvant (anastrozole or
exemestane) and extended adjuvant settings (letrozole) where
specific ais have proven superior to tamoxifen [56]. the 2005
asco guidelines support the use of an ai in hr+
postmenopausal women with early breast cancer as
a component of adjuvant therapy, although the optimal
sequence and duration of therapy are as yet unknown [30]. as

cardiovascular events (5.8% letrozole vs 5.6% placebo;
p = 0.76) was similar between letrozole and placebo groups
[51]. an increased incidence of new osteoporosis was observed
with patients receiving letrozole (p = 0.003); however, the rate
of clinical bone fractures was not statistically significant
between the two treatment arms [51]. statistically more
patients receiving letrozole had hot flashes, anorexia, arthralgia
and alopecia, while more placebo patients reported vaginal
bleeding [51].
at the time of the unblinding in october of 2003, patients
originally randomized to placebo were offered letrozole free of
charge. a total of 1655 women chose letrozole, and 613 women
chose no additional therapy [52]. interestingly, patients
choosing letrozole were younger, had a lower performance
status and were more likely to have node-positive disease and
have had treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy—an overall
worse prognosis group. however, in this nonrandomized
comparison, women who chose letrozole following a median of
2.5 years of placebo had statistically improved dfs, distant dfs
and overall survival as well as less new contralateral breast
cancer compared with those who chose no additional therapy.
treatment appeared safe, with an increase in new osteoporosis
but no difference in bone fractures or cardiovascular disease.
these very interesting data suggest that therapy with an ai,
even at a median of 7.5 years following diagnosis, can
significantly affect breast cancer outcome and is affecting late
recurrences seen in hr+ breast cancer.
ma.17r is an ongoing study designed to evaluate continued
therapy with letrozole for up to 15 years. patients who are
disease-free after completing 5 years of extended adjuvant
letrozole (either in the ma.17 trial or routine clinical practice)
and women completing 5 years of any adjuvant ai (as initial
treatment or after any prior length of time on tamoxifen) will
be offered re-randomization at year 10 to continue either
letrozole or placebo for an additional 5 years [53].
extended adjuvant letrozole therapy offers all women, even
those at minimal risk, an opportunity to further reduce their
ongoing risk of breast cancer recurrence following adjuvant
tamoxifen treatment. given the evolving data utilizing ais in
the adjuvant setting, this is particularly important for women
who are premenopausal at diagnosis but become
postmenopausal during tamoxifen treatment.

review
ais become the standard of care for postmenopausal women
with hr+ early-stage breast cancer, it will become critical to
understand the long-term side effects and risks and to
incorporate regular screening tests as well as appropriate
preventive strategies. at the present time, bone mineral density
and cholesterol should be monitored, and treatment provided
as indicated by current guidelines [29, 56, 57].

therapy than on first-line tamoxifen therapy were alive at each
6-month interval during the first 2 years of treatment (all
comparisons p < 0.025) [62]. a crossover trial was built into
this study with prospectively planned survival analyses at
6-month intervals, which allowed patients to switch to the
alternate hormone therapy after progression; 51% of letrozole
patients and 49% of tamoxifen patients crossed over at
a median of 32 months. the large number of patients crossing
over potentially impaired the chance of seeing an overall
survival advantage.
the survival results from this trial with the crossover design
and the results of the trials outlined above indicate that
hormone therapies should be offered in sequence for women
with hormone-responsive advanced breast cancer, as there
appears to be at least some degree of non–cross-resistance.
 xxxd2165xxx  is a pure er antagonist or down-regulator
without agonist properties that is approved as second-line
therapy following tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with
advanced breast cancer. in a randomized, double-blind,
double-dummy, parallel-group, multinational study comparing
250 mg  xxxd2165xxx  given as an intramuscular injection once
a month with tamoxifen once daily (n = 587) as first-line
therapy for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women,
no significant difference was seen between groups for ttp or
or at a median follow-up of 14.5 months [63]. treatment with
 xxxd2165xxx  in patients whose disease progressed after treatment
with tamoxifen resulted in similar ttp and response rates
compared with anastrozole [64], providing another treatment
option for postmenopausal women with hr+ advanced breast
cancer. pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that it takes
approximately 3 months to achieve steady state levels in the
serum of patients receiving monthly injections of  xxxd2165xxx 
[65], leading to a number of ongoing trials evaluating a loading
dose of  xxxd2165xxx  every 2 weeks for three doses, followed by
monthly injections, as well as an evaluation of initial dosing
at 500 mg. one recent study evaluated a loading dose of 500 mg
of  xxxd2165xxx , following by 250 mg day 14 and day 28, followed
by standard monthly dosing [66]. pk data demonstrated that
steady state levels were achieved at one month, suggesting that
this is a more appropriate and potentially effective method of
administration. an ongoing cooperative group trial is
comparing first-line  xxxd2165xxx  to anastrozole utilizing the
loading dose approach.

second-line therapy
the nccn guidelines recommend the use of an ai in
postmenopausal women with recurrent breast cancer who have
received antiestrogen treatment within the past 12 months [56].
another option for second-line endocrine treatment is
 xxxd2165xxx , which has been shown to be as effective as
anastrozole in patients whose disease progressed during
tamoxifen treatment [67] (see above). several studies have
evaluated sequential hormone therapy and found small but
consistent response regardless of the order in which therapy
was administered [68–70]. the recently presented phase iii

to  xxxd2165xxx  [66]. six hundred and ninety three

first-line therapy
two identical, double-blind, randomized, multicenter trials
were conducted in north america and in europe, comparing
first-line anastrozole with tamoxifen in 1021 postmenopausal
women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer [58,
59]. patients with known er– tumors were excluded from both
trials. there was a substantial difference in the percentage of
confirmed hr+ patients between the two studies, with 89% in
the north american study and 45% in the other. the primary
end point was time to progression (ttp) [58]. analysed
together, the trials demonstrated that tamoxifen and
anastrozole had similar efficacy with respect to ttp (hazard
ratio = 1.13) [58]. however, women with known hr+ disease
receiving anastrozole in the combined analysis fared better,
with a median ttp of 10.7 months versus 6.4 months for the
tamoxifen group (p = 0.022) [58]. response rates were similar
in both studies between the two arms, but in the north
american trial, progression-free survival was longer in patients
treated with anastrozole (11.1 months vs 5.6 months; p = 0.005
[59]. these differences can probably be attributed to the
imbalance in hr+ subjects between the two studies. there was
no difference in overall survival between the two arms of either
study.
the european organisation for research and treatment of
cancer (eortc) evaluated exemestane or tamoxifen as firstline hormonal therapy in 382 patients with hr+ metastatic
breast cancer in a randomized, open-label phase iii trial.
progression-free survival was the primary end point. in this
trial 84%–88% of women had known hr+ disease. exemestane
significantly reduced the risk of progression relative to
tamoxifen (hazard ratio = 0.84; p = 0.028, 9.9 vs 5.8 months)
[60]. objective response was higher in patients treated with
exemestane than in patients treated with tamoxifen (46% vs
31%, respectively; odds ratio = 1.85; p = 0.005). overall survival
was similar between the two arms of the trial.
a phase iii, multinational, randomized, double-blind study
evaluated letrozole or tamoxifen in 907 postmenopausal
women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. the
primary end point was ttp, defined as the interval between the
date of randomization and the earliest date of disease
progression [61]. compared with tamoxifen, letrozole
significantly improved ttp (median, 9.4 vs 6.0 months;
p < 0.0001), time to treatment failure (median, 9.0 vs 5.7
months; p < 0.0001) and or (32% vs 21%; p = 0.0002). similar
to the two trials outlined above, there was no significant
difference between the two arms in terms of overall survival
[62]. however, significantly more patients on first-line letrozole

the median duration of response was quite long, ranging from
9.8 to 13.5 months and cb was seen in up to 29% of patients

evidence of resistance to antiestrogens and ais is evident from
incomplete responses and recurrent or relapsing disease [71].
maintaining options for further endocrine therapy is clinically
important because of the sequencing regimens under study.
endocrine therapies are also generally better tolerated than
chemotherapy, so the availability of endocrine treatment for
relapsed/recurrent disease is an important area of study.
patterns of endocrine therapy resistance have been described
[72]; understanding these patterns is important in order to
assess responses to and potential benefits of endocrine
therapies. interestingly, patients will respond to further
endocrine therapy even after their disease has progressed while
on tamoxifen [73]. little cross-resistance has been reported
either between the antiestrogens and the ais or within the
group of ais [68, 70, 74, 75]. use of drugs such as  xxxd2165xxx 
with a novel mechanism of action may also help to reduce the
development of cross-resistance [76]. further study should
provide information about the effect, if any, of cross-resistance
between hormonal therapies and the potential impact of
sequencing drugs used as hormonal therapy. correlation of
gene arrays to response and resistance to hormone therapy in
patients with hr+ breast cancer will help to triage patients to
appropriate therapies in the future.  xxxg721xxx  overexpression
has correlated with poorer overall outcome on hormonal
therapy. the trastuzumab in dual her2 positive er positive
metastatic breast cancer tandem trial randomized women
with  xxxg721xxx  and er+ untreated metastatic breast cancer to
anastrozole with or without trastuzumab [77]. although this
study demonstrated a significant advantage for both response
rate (6.8 vs 20.3%; p = 0.018) and progression-free survival
(2.4 vs 4.8 months; p = 0.0016) with the addition of
trastuzumab, the duration of response was still disappointingly
short, and there was no difference in overall survival. these
data suggest that hormonal therapy is perhaps best used
following chemotherapy but with continued trastuzumab to
maintain remission. ongoing and planned clinical trials are
evaluating the role of targeted therapies, including agents
that target the  xxxg721xxx  and  xxxg681xxx 
receptors, angiogenesis and down-stream signaling in
combination with ais and  xxxd2165xxx  to overcome resistance
to therapy targeting the  xxxg730xxx .

treatment in women with early or advanced hormone-sensitive
breast cancer. when used as adjuvant treatment in early breast
cancer, ais have improved dfs in several settings. the atac
trial of anastrozole and the big 1-98 study of letrozole each
demonstrated significantly prolonged dfs in the ai group
compared with the tamoxifen group, but only letrozole showed
significant dfs improvement for patients at increased risk of
early recurrence (i.e., node-positive disease or chemotherapytreated patients). central analysis of primary tumor samples
from patients enrolled in both the big 1-98 and atac trials
showed a benefit for the ai in all patients with er+ tumors
irrespective of pgr status, indicating that treatment decisions
for the use of ais should not be made based on pgr status or
on retrospective analysis of local tissue staining. studies
employing a switch to anastrozole or exemestane after 2 to 3
years of tamoxifen resulted in significantly less recurrence in
patients who switched to the ai compared with those who
remained on tamoxifen, with a borderline benefit for overall
survival. pending data from big 1-98 will compare a switch to
letrozole at 2 years with upfront letrozole, as well as the reverse
switch with tamoxifen. ma.17 is a landmark trial clearly
showing that letrozole as extended adjuvant therapy provided
continued protection from recurrence in patients who had
already completed 5 years of tamoxifen, and it is the only ai to
date showing improvement in survival in the node-positive
subgroup. the femara versus anastrozole clinical evaluation
trial is now under way to determine which nonsteroidal ai is
superior in the adjuvant treatment of patients with nodepositive tumors. in hormone-sensitive advanced or metastatic
breast cancer, treatment with ais in general resulted in
improved ttp and improved response for letrozole and
exemestane. currently, anastrozole and letrozole are indicated
for first- and second-line treatment of patients with hr+ or
hr–/status unknown advanced/metastatic breast cancer, while
exemestane is approved for second-line treatment.
published guidelines now include the use of the thirdgeneration ais as adjuvant treatment alone or following
a course of tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with hr+
disease [29, 56]. there are highly effective new options for the
treatment of early- and late-stage hr+ breast cancer that have
improved treatment options, dfs and ttp and have already
been shown to improve survival in the extended therapy
setting. it is important for oncologists and primary care
physicians to understand the potential short- and long-term
risks of these agents when used in the early-stage setting, so that
appropriate testing and preventive treatment can be offered.
additional studies are evaluating the efficacy of the
combination of ovarian suppression and ais in premenopausal
women.
