summary voltage-dependent calcium channels (vdccs) are heteromultimeric complexes that mediate calcium influx
into cells in response to changes in membrane potential. the a1a subunit, encoded by the  xxxg302xxx  gene, is the poreforming subunit specific to the neuronal p/q-type vdccs. these are implicated in fast excitatory and inhibitory
neurotransmission. their highest levels of expression are found in the purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and in the
hippocampus.
spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (sca 6) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar degeneration that shares neuropathological findings with late-onset cortical cerebellar atrophy (cca). it is caused by an abnormal expansion of a
trinucleotide (cag) repeat in exon 47 of  xxxg302xxx , on chromosome 19p13. this translates into a  xxxd2212xxx  (polyq)
tract of prolonged length in the carboxyl terminal of the a1a subunit. heterologous expression of mutated a1a subunits
results in increased channel inactivation in electrophysiological tests. no treatment is known to improve sca 6 at
present, as none of the available drugs is able to reverse a1a dysregulation, nor disturbed protein aggregation,
transport and localization in this disease.
the drugs gabapentin and pregabalin interact with the a2d subunit of the p/q-type vdccs. gabapentin and
pregabalin slow the rate of inactivation in recombinant p/q-type vdccs, expressed in xenopus oocytes. these drugs
improve ataxia in cases of cca, olivopontocerebellar atrophy and ataxia-telangiectasia. on the basis of the
neuropathological identity of sca 6 with cca, and given the capacity of gabapentin and pregabalin to decrease p/qtype vdccs inactivation, in this paper the authors put forward the hypothesis that the administration of gabapentin and
pregabalin might prove beneficial in sca 6 as the ataxia caused by this disease would be expected to improve. the
authors hope that researchers working with this illness will be inspired and encouraged to undertake the appropriate
clinical and experimental work.

introduction
voltage-dependent calcium channels (vdccs) are
important elements in neurons and other excitable
cells. disturbances of vdccs cause a number of
neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, migraine,
muscle weakness and cerebellar ataxia. spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (sca 6) is a genetic illness that
affects the p/q-type voltage-dependent calcium
channel (p/qcc), and interferes with purkinje cell
calcium homeostasis. no treatment is currently
available for this disease.
the drugs gabapentin and pregabalin interact
with the p/qccs and have alleviated ataxia in late
cortical cerebellar atrophy (cca) and other degenerative ataxias. their mechanism of action seems
to be appropriate for counteracting the channel
dysregulation found in transgenic models of sca
6. the aim of this work is to demonstrate that
gabapentin and pregabalin could prove beneficial
in the treatment of this disease.
in order to provide appropriate support for this
hypothesis, the authors have reviewed the following subjects: (1) structure and regulation of p/
qccs; (2) the pathophysiology of sca 6; and (3)
the mechanism of action of the drugs gabapentin
and pregabalin.

p/q-type voltage-dependent calcium
channels
vdccs are heteromeric complexes with the capacity to mediate calcium influx into cells in response
to changes in membrane potential. calcium entering the cell serves as a second messenger of electrical signalling, initiating a multiplicity of cellular
functions. vdccs are composed of several subunits,
of which a1 has the property to form the structural
ion channel [1].
p-type currents were identified in guinea pig
purkinje cells and in the squid giant synapse [2].
they were selectively blocked by x-agatoxin-iva
[3], which reduced over 80% of the total calcium
current in rat purkinje neurons [4]. p-type vdccs
are predominant in purkinje cells [5].
q-type currents were identified in rat cerebellar
granule cells. the resemblance between q-type,
and the p-type currents generated by a1a subunits
in oocytes led to the conclusion that a1a should give
rise to both types of currents [6]. this subunit is,
therefore, specific to p-type and q-type vdccs [7].
p/q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels
(p/qcc) are restricted to central and peripheral
neurons [1]. the p/qccs (also referred to as
 xxxg302xxx ) contribute to the majority (90%) of depo-

gazulla and tintoreÃÅ
larization-induced calcium current in the purkinje
cell. it is found extensively in the human nervous
system, with the highest presence in the cerebellum and hippocampus [8].
p/qccs are high threshold calcium channels
which control neuronal survival, excitability, plasticity and genetic expression, and mediate fast
neurotransmitter release at synapses and neuromuscular junctions [9]. changes in membrane potential activate vdccs and the increase in
cytoplasmic calcium causes exocytosis of synaptic
vesicles [10]. p/qccs have been found to be
responsible for the control of acetylcholine release
at the mature mammalian neuromuscular junction
[11]. inhibitory (gaba) postsynaptic currents in
cerebellar nuclear neurons were suppressed, and
excitatory (glutamate) postsynaptic currents in
hippocampal neurons were decreased by 60% by
x-agatoxin-iva, in slices of rat brain [12]. these
facts underline the importance of the p/qcc in
neurotransmission.

structure and regulation of p/q-type
voltage-dependent calcium channels
the a1 subunit defines the vdcc type. there are at
least ten a1 subtypes, each one with its own physiological and pharmacological properties [1]. the
a1a subunit corresponds to the p/q-type channel
[7], and is encoded by the  xxxg302xxx  gene [5]. in
addition, vdccs comprise b, a2d and c subunits,
which regulate channel activity [1].
the a1a subunit is a 190 kda protein having over
2000 aminoacid residues with four identical domains (i‚Äìiv), each containing six helical, membrane
spanning segments (s1‚Äìs6). the pore-forming region lies between s5 and s6, and the voltage sensor,
in s4. the four domains are linked by three large
intracellular loops. the a1a subunit is sufficient to
conduct calcium currents on its own and is responsible for channel gating, permeability and voltage
dependence of activation and inactivation [1].
modulation of a1a activity is exercised by its
auxiliary subunits [13] and by g intracellular proteins [1]. it is also subject to feedback regulation
by calcium. this effect requires the direct association of calcium/calmodulin with the calmodulin
binding domain (cbd), located close to the c-terminal end of a1a [14,15]. calcium entering the cell
first binds to the c-terminal of cbd and stimulates
calcium currents, whereas further cell calcium
inhibits them after binding to the n-terminal, finishing calcium influx.
the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin is
physically attached to lii‚Äìiii [16]. the docking

the p/q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel as pharmacological target
membrane proteins syntaxin and snap 25 also attach to lii‚Äìiii during synaptic vesicle priming [17].
the immediate proximity between synaptic vesicle
proteins, membrane docking proteins and the synprint site of a1a therefore seems best to promote
a high efficiency of neurotransmitter release.
the intracellular b subunit binds to li‚Äìii, close
to the g protein receptor site [1,18]. co-expression
of a b subunit with a1a modified channel kinetics,
b4 inducing the greatest increase in current amplitude (19.3 ¬± 7.8 fold) in transfected xenopus oocytes, and b3 exerting a milder (5.48 ¬± 2.1 fold)
stimulation [13]. a1 subunits may associate with
any of the four b subunit types in the human nervous systems [19].
the a2d family is comprised of four genes. it
seems probable that the a2 domain provides the
structural elements necessary for channel modulation, whilst d anchors a2 to the a1a subunit [20].
the a2d subunit stimulates the current density of
p/qccs in the presence of a b subunit, by promoting allosteric changes in a1a and by recruitment
and synthesis of functional channels [13]. xenopus
oocytes co-expressing complementary rna (crna)
of human a1b and b3 subunits demonstrated a similar increase (7.6‚Äì9 fold) in current amplitude in
the company of either a2d-1 or a2d-2 subunits, albeit a slower inactivation rate after pulses of
+20 mv in the presence of the a2d-2 subunit. the
largest stimulatory effect was found to be exerted
by the b3/a2d-2 combination [21].
the a2d-1, a2d-2 and a2d-3 subunits have been
identified in the brain [22,23]. the expression of
a2d-1 was demonstrated as being strongest in the
pyramidal cell layer of the mouse hippocampus
[23], while that of a2d-2 was greatest in the purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum [24].
any of the transmembrane c2, c3 and c4 subtypes may form part of the p/qcc [25,26]. their
precise role in calcium channel physiology is undetermined at present.
few drugs interact with the p/q-type vdcc,
regardless of its potential as therapeutic target.
the a2d subunit has been implicated as target for
the drugs gabapentin [22] and pregabalin; otherwise, none of the known drugs modifies a1a, b or
c subunit function in a clinically favourable manner.

spinocerebellar ataxia type 6
sca 6 is an autosomal dominant cerebellar degeneration associated with the expansion of a trinucleotide cag repeat in the last exon of  xxxg302xxx ;
4‚Äì18 cag repeats are present in healthy individuals. this gene is on chromosome 19p13 and has 47

133

exons [5,27‚Äì30]. expanded sequences of cag repeats determine abnormally long tracts of glutamine residues.
sca 6 causes a slow, progressive ‚Äòpure‚Äô cerebellar syndrome, with onset between the third and
fifth decade of life. transient unsteadiness may occur before permanent symptoms develop [27,28].
its principal clinical expression is truncal and limb
ataxia [27‚Äì30]. sca 6 appears to be the most common cause of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia in northern europe [31]. the prevalence of sca 6
among genotyped dominant ataxias was 31% in japan [32], 23.5% in the netherlands [33] and 1% in
italy [34] and spain [35].
pathological findings in sca 6 include diffuse loss
of purkinje cells, predominant in the cerebellar
vermis [36,37].  xxxd2212xxx  (polyq) and calcium
channel protein aggregates have been detected in
purkinje cells [38]. it has been noted that sca 6
shares neuropathological findings with cca [37].

pathophysiology of spinocerebellar
ataxia type 6
polyq expansion disorders are diseases caused by
the presence of excessively long stretches of glutamine residues in proteins. however, polyq tracts
are exceptionally short in sca 6 (21‚Äì33 glutamine
residues) [34,39,40], making aggregation an
improbable single pathogenic cause. sca 6 is unique among dominant ataxias in that its affected
gene product, the a1a subunit, exerts a recognized
function [41]. the polyq tract is located beyond
the pore-forming region of a1a, close to the cbd
and to a g protein interaction domain, indicating
that altered channel regulation might play a role
in the pathogenesis of sca 6.
matsuyama et al. [40] studied the effects of
polyq expansion on rabbit a1a subunits by comparing currents flowing through channels with 4, 24, 30
and 40 glutamine residues, using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique. auxiliary a2 and b1 subunits
were expressed by baby hamster kidney cells. the
current densities were not modified in cells
expressing expanded channels. a1a subunits with
30 and 40 glutamine residues demonstrated a negative shift of 8 mv in the voltage dependence of
inactivation, meaning that the number of active
p/q-type vdccs was halved and calcium influx reduced. thus, lack of adequate calcium ingress
was evoked as the cause of neuronal loss in  xxxg302xxx .
toru et al. [42] studied the properties of rabbithuman chimeric a1a subunits with 13, 24 and 28
polyq residues, in hek 293 cells co-expressing b1a
and a2d subunits, with no difference in current

134
density being found among channels. negative
shifts in voltage-dependent inactivation were recorded, in proportion to the length of the expanded polyq tracts. consequently, functional
vdccs near the resting membrane potential should
be reduced in mutated cells. the authors proposed
that decreased calcium influx might lead to purkinje cell death in sca 6.
restituito et al. [43] introduced b, a2d and rabbit-human chimeric a1a subunits with 13, 22, 26
and 30 glutamine residues into xenopus oocytes.
a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation, a slowing of inactivation and abolition of
regulation by g proteins were found in electrophysiological tests of cells expressing expanded polyq
tracts. as a consequence, current densities were
increased. these effects were seen only when the
chimeric a1a subunits were co-expressed with b4,
though not with b2 or b3 subunits.
piedras-renterƒ±ÃÅa et al. [44] introduced human
a1a cdna in hek 293 cells expressing b1 and a2d1 subunits. electrophysiological testing of cells
expressing a1a subunits with 4, 11, 23, 27 and 72
repeats resulted in increased current density in
mutated cells, in spite of similar physical channel
properties. an increased mutated protein expression, demonstrated by inmunocytochemical methods, was reported to be the cause.
accordingly, p/q-type vdcc dysregulation has a
pivotal role in the pathogenesis of sca 6. preserved
function of the pore-forming region has been demonstrated by the normal current densities found in
transfected cells. electrophysiological testing
yielded enhanced channel inactivation in some
experiments [40,42], and increased activation in
others [43,44]. with respect to the latter, a oneoff utilization of a b4 subunit, or abolition of g protein regulation, may have accounted for this result
in one test [43] and an unrepeated elevation in mutated protein expression in the other [44]. additional diversity in transfected cell type, source of
heterologous material and length of polyq tracts
may have added to the inconsistency of the results.
in addition to p/q-type vdcc dysregulation,
abnormal protein aggregation has been revealed
in sca 6 [29,38,39]. the specific relevance of this
issue has yet to be established.

therapeutic approach to spinocerebellar
ataxia type 6
there is no etiologic treatment for sca 6. only the
drug acetazolamide has been tried in sca 6 by jen
et al. [45], and by yabe et al. [46], with limited
improvement in ataxia.

gazulla and tintoreÃÅ
nevertheless, the p/qcc might represent an
accessible, and potentially a very important therapeutic target in sca 6, especially as the pore-forming region is preserved and channel dysregulation
seems to underlie the disease.
gabapentin and pregabalin bind the a2d subunit
[47], and exert their effect on neurotransmission
through a presynaptic mechanism. gabapentin
has been shown to increase brain gaba concentration in humans [48]. acute treatment with gabapentin has been shown not to diminish peak
current amplitude of recombinant p/qccs (a1a/
b3/a2d-1) expressed in xenopus oocytes, while
prolonged administration slowed the rate of inactivation in a dose-dependent manner [49]. gabapentin binds preferentially to the a2d-1 subunit, while
pregabalin does so to a2d-2 [50]; none of them targets a2d-3. pregabalin has exhibited more delayed
channel inactivation than gabapentin under experimental conditions [47,50].
gabapentin has been shown capable of improving ataxia in cases of cca [51] and of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (opca) [52]. pregabalin was
able to ameliorate ataxia in a case of ataxia-telangiectasia, not benefited by administration of gabapentin. the enhanced efficiency was attributed to
the higher affinity of pregabalin towards a2d-2,
and delayed channel inactivation [53].
ataxia caused by cca was relieved by the drug
gabapentin [51]. it has been pointed out that sca 6
shares neuropathological findings with cca [37], a
fact that may have the meaning that both diseases
share some pathogenic mechanisms. the use of
gabapentin and pregabalin may well hold promise
in sca 6, because stimulation of the ancillary a2d
subunit [54] might offset the dysregulation (increased inactivation) demonstrated by mutated
a1a subunits in electrophysiological studies
[40,42]. similarly, pregabalin might prove particularly favourable in sca 6, as the expression of a2d2 is maximal in purkinje cells.
in this context, precise knowledge about the effects of gabapentin and pregabalin on cells
expressing expanded a1a subunits would be desirable, as they are currently unknown. evaluating
the effects of these drugs on animal purkinje cells
bearing mutations affecting a1a and auxiliary vdcc
subunit genes might also provide valuable information, since no experimental studies of this kind are
available at present.

conclusion
it has been stated above that no etiologic treatment
is on hand for sca 6. consequently, any medicine

the p/q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel as pharmacological target
able to afford symptomatic benefit should be welcome, even if lacking curative properties.
drugs with affinity towards vdcc, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, may have a role in the treatment of sca 6. being drugs that target the a2-d
subunit, their label of antiepileptic and analgesic
drugs may prove scarce in the long term, as these
drugs might prove successful in the treatment of
diseases that involve tissues rich in vdccs, as the
cerebellar cortex and the neuromuscular junction,
and of inherited or acquired calcium channelopathies, irrespective of the symptoms these disorders
produce.
ideally, the adjustment in calcium homeostasis
achieved with gabapentin and pregabalin would
give way to an amelioration of ataxia in sca 6, even
though the protein aggregation disturbance is not
dealt with. it is clear that this hypothesis should
be verified by the appropriate clinical trials, in
which an ataxia scale (such as the international
cerebellar ataxia rating scale) [55], video recording, body stabilometry, or any combination of
them, should be used to assess the changes brought
about by the drugs under test. a double blind, placebo-controlled trial with gabapentin, pregabalin,
or both drugs would be preferable to an open-label
study, in order to avoid biases attributable to a placebo effect of gabapentin or pregabalin.
other inherited or acquired calcium channelopathies could also benefit from treatment with gabapentin and pregabalin. a previously defined
procedure, in which single doses of 400 mg of gabapentin and of 75 mg of pregabalin are utilized,
could help to single out cerebellar ataxias that
could benefit from treatment with these drugs
[51,53].
at present, it is impossible for the authors to
demonstrate the hypothesis advanced in this article. they would recommend researchers with access to sca 6 to take this work into consideration
and carry out the relevant clinical and experimental studies.
