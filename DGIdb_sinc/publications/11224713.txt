update on topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
ulrike herkel, md, and norbert pfeiffer, md

topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are a novel addition to
the armamentarium of medical glaucoma treatment;
 xxxd1931xxx  has been available since 1995 and  xxxd367xxx 
since 1998. they lower intraocular pressure by inhibiting
carbonic anhydrase, a key enzyme for aqueous humor
formation. intraocular pressure–lowering activity of the
substances appears to be the same and is similar to that of
most other agents, but it does not reach the activity of the
unselective ß-blocker  xxxd3377xxx  or the prostaglandin  xxxd2446xxx .
on concomitant treatment, additivity is reached with all other
topical agents. a possible improvement of blood flow may offer
an additional benefit, but its significance for the long-term
outcome for human glaucoma remains to be shown. side
effects are mostly local. a more physiologic ph of  xxxd367xxx 
appears to be advantageous. curr opin ophthalmol 2001, 12:88–93

systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (cai) are among
the most powerful medications for lowering intraocular
pressure (iop), but their use is accompanied by cumbersome side effects. thus, the 1995 introduction of  xxxd1931xxx , the first topical cai, marks an important development in medical glaucoma therapy.  xxxd1931xxx  was
the first of three new classes of glaucoma agents to be
introduced, followed by prostaglandins and ␣2-agonists.
 xxxd367xxx , a second topically active cai, became
available in the united states in 1998 and in many european countries within the past year. this review summarizes properties, activity, and side effects of topical
cai, stressing the literature published since the major
reviews by pfeiffer [1] and talluto, wyse, and krupin [2]
in 1997.

pharmacology of topical carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors
 xxxd1931xxx  is a heterocyclic thieno-thiopyran with sufficient lipophilicity to penetrate the eye after topical administration [1,2]. the new topical cai  xxxd367xxx  is
a heterocyclic thienothiazine sulfonamide with a free
amine. the molecular structure is similar to  xxxd1931xxx ,
but a sidechain was added that makes  xxxd367xxx  more
lipophilic than  xxxd1931xxx  or acetazolamide at a physiologic ph (fig. 1). thus,  xxxd367xxx  can better cross
lipid membranes. the binding affinity constants (ki) for
 xxxg293xxx  for  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx , and acetazolamide
are 0.51 nm, 0.13 ± 0.03 nm, and 33.8 nm, respectively
[5]. however, the concentration needed to inhibit 50% of
 xxxg293xxx  (ic50), representing the inhibitory potency, is 3.19
± 0.3 nm for  xxxd367xxx  and 3.74 ± 0.02 nm for  xxxd1931xxx  and thus is lower than that for acetazolamide
(9.04 nm). the concentration of  xxxd367xxx  in irisciliary body in pigmented rabbits after topical application
is 10 µm/g and is thus sufficient to inhibit the enzyme in
excess. topical ocular doses are systemically absorbed.
although the carbonic anhydrases of erythrocytes were
not totally inhibited, the mean half-life of 111 ± 29 days
is remarkably long.
carbonic anhydrase is a key enzyme in aqueous humor
formation. the aqueous flow rate in humans is approximately 2.8 µl/min during the day and decreases to about
1.2 µl/min at night. after topical application of  xxxd1931xxx  or  xxxd367xxx  in healthy subjects, aqueous
humor formation was reduced by 0.34 ± 0.2 µl/min
(14%) and 0.47 ± 0.2 µl/min (19%) during the day and by
0.1 ± 0.13 µl/min (8%) and 0.16 ± 0.12/min (16%) at
night, which did not represent a statistically significant
difference [6].

tid in glaucoma patients and found an equivalent iop
reduction by  xxxd367xxx  tid (−4.1 to −4.8 mmhg,
−16.6 to −19.1%) and  xxxd1931xxx  tid (−4.3 to −4.9
mmhg, −16.9 to −20.1%).  xxxd367xxx  bid was less
effective (−3.4 to −4.1 mmhg, −13.2 to −16.7%) but statistically and clinically equivalent to the other treatments. this study confirms the results of a previous
study [10] that compared  xxxd367xxx  bid and tid
with  xxxd1931xxx  tid and  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid. the iop
changes after  xxxd367xxx  bid (−3.8 to −5.7 mmhg)
and tid (−4.2 to −5.6 mmhg) were statistically and
clinically equivalent to each other as well as to  xxxd1931xxx  tid (−4.3 to −5.9 mmhg). however,  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%
bid was significantly more effective than both cais
(−5.2 to −6.3 mmhg). these data support  xxxd367xxx ’s
labeling for a twice-daily application.

dose-response behavior of  xxxd367xxx 
the optimal concentration and dosing scheme for  xxxd367xxx  was established in two studies. silver et al. [7]
determined the dose response for twice-daily (bid)  xxxd367xxx , 0.3%, 1%, 2%, and 3%, for 2 weeks in patients
with primary open angle glaucoma. the maximal effect
(16.1% mean and 14.5% trough iop reduction) was
reached at a concentration of 1%; higher concentrations
resulted in more adverse events.
march and ochsner [8] reported on the long-term safety
and efficacy of  xxxd367xxx  1% bid in patients with
primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension
with a follow-up of 18 months. the iop-lowering efficacy remained stable during the observation period with
a mean iop change at trough of −3.3 mmhg, and a
change of −3.5 mmhg and −3.3 mmhg at 1 and 18
months, respectively. the mean iop reduction at trough
with  xxxd367xxx  thrice daily (tid) was −3.3 mmhg,
which was not statistically different from  xxxd367xxx 
bid. however, in the same study,  xxxd3377xxx  showed a significantly stronger iop reduction with a mean change at
trough of −5.2 mmhg. adverse events were ocular discomfort (burning or stinging), which occurred more frequently with  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid (8%) than with  xxxd367xxx  bid (3.3%) or tid (5.9%) treatment. blurred vision was induced more often by  xxxd367xxx  bid (8%)
than by tid (5.2%) or by  xxxd3377xxx  bid (5.3%). it should
be noted, that the drop-out rate for all types of treatment
was high (36 to 41%).
sall et al. [9] compared the efficacy and safety of treatment with  xxxd367xxx  bid or tid with  xxxd1931xxx 

when  xxxd1931xxx  arrived on the market, it was compared with ␤-blockers. meanwhile studies were performed to establish comparative efficacy of  xxxd1931xxx ,
 xxxd367xxx , brimonidine, and  xxxd2446xxx .
stewart et al. [11] compared the iop effect of brimonidine tid and  xxxd1931xxx  tid treatment in a
crossover study. both treatments reduced iop in glaucoma or ocular hypertension from 24.1 ± 2.0 to 18.6 ± 3.4
mmhg (peak) and 20.7 ± 3.1 mmhg (trough,  xxxd1931xxx ) and 17.8 ± 2.7 mmhg and 20.8 ±3.2 mmhg ( xxxd367xxx ); this did not represent a statistically significant
difference.
o’donoghue [12] compared once-daily (uid)  xxxd2446xxx  monotherapy with  xxxd1931xxx  tid (baseline 27.2
± 3 mmhg) and found significantly lower mean diurnal
iop (−8.5 ± 3.3 mmhg) on  xxxd2446xxx  than on  xxxd1931xxx  (−5.6 ± 2.6 mmhg). on  xxxd2446xxx , the peak iop
reduction (−8.6 mmhg, 32%) and trough iop reduction
(−8.1 mmhg, 31%) were significantly lower than on  xxxd1931xxx  (peak −6.2 mmhg, 23%; trough −4.7 mmhg,
17%). furthermore, in a crossover study,  xxxd2446xxx 
showed less circadian fluctuation than  xxxd3377xxx  or  xxxd1931xxx  [13•]. the comparison revealed that  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%
bid was more effective at 3:00 pm than was  xxxd1931xxx  tid, whereas  xxxd1931xxx  maintained its efficacy
overnight and was more effective than  xxxd3377xxx  at 3:00
am (fig. 2).
 xxxd367xxx  tid appears to have an additional effect
on iop in patients with inadequately controlled iop on
 xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid treatment [14]: the additional reduction following  xxxd367xxx  was −3.3 to −4.1 mmhg
(−13.2 to −16.6%). brubaker et al. [15•] compared a fixed
combination of  xxxd1931xxx  bid and  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid
with concomitant treatment of  xxxd367xxx  bid and
betaxolol 0.5% bid. the  xxxd1931xxx  combination lowered aqueous flow by 51% and iop by 18 to 24%,

all drugs significantly reduced iop in comparison with baseline, except  xxxd3377xxx  at
3 am.  xxxd2446xxx  lead to a fairly uniform circadian iop reduction.  xxxd3377xxx  was
more effective than  xxxd1931xxx  at 3 pm whereas  xxxd1931xxx  performed better
than  xxxd3377xxx  at midnight and 3 am. published with permission [13•]. iop,
intraocular pressure.

whereas the  xxxd367xxx –betaxolol combination reduced flow by 39 to 44% and iop by 14 to 19%. the
reduction could be because of the smaller effect of betaxolol than  xxxd3377xxx  [16].
stewart et al. [17] compared treatment of  xxxd2446xxx 
uid, brimonidine bid or tid, or  xxxd1931xxx  bid and
tid when added to a ␤-blocker. all three combination
therapies decreased iop significantly. there was no difference between bid or tid application of brimonidine
or  xxxd1931xxx . however,  xxxd2446xxx  (iop, −6.3 ± 4.1 to
16.7 ± 3.3 mmhg) and brimonidine (iop, −4.2 ± 4.5 to
17.4 ± 4.9 mmhg) were statistically more potent in additive iop reduction than was  xxxd1931xxx  (iop, −3.1 ±
5.1 to 20.1 ± 6.1 mmhg). emmerich [18] reported that
 xxxd2446xxx  uid monotherapy (iop reduction, −4.5 ± 0.2
to 17.6 ± 2 mmhg) was as effective as combination
therapy of  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx  bid (iop reduction,
−4.4 ± 0.2 to 17.6 ± 1.9 mmhg).
whereas  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  decrease aqueous humor production,  xxxd2446xxx  increases aqueous outflow.
susanna, nicolela, and oga [19] therefore studied the
additive effect of  xxxd2446xxx  in patients with uncontrolled iop already on combination therapy with  xxxd3377xxx 
0.5% bid and  xxxd1931xxx  bid. a further iop decrease
from 19.3 ± 5 to 16.2 ± 5.2 mmhg (16%) was achieved
with  xxxd2446xxx . a total of 20.4% of patients had a further iop reduction of more than 30%, but some did not
respond to additional therapy: 29.5% of patients showed
an iop reduction of less than 5%.

comparing the acute additive iop-lowering effect of
 xxxd1931xxx  with brimonidine in glaucoma patients on
 xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid with inadequately controlled iop,
centofanti et al. [20] found a mean iop reduction from
19.36 ± 1.82 mmhg by −4 ± 2.9 mmhg for  xxxd1931xxx 
versus −7 ± 4.1 mmhg for brimonidine. thus, brimonidine has a significant additive iop-lowering effect
that appears to be greater than that of  xxxd1931xxx .
efficacy and impact on daily life of a fixed bid combination of  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% and  xxxd1931xxx  versus  xxxd3377xxx 
0.5% bid in combination with pilocarpine 2% qid were
investigated by sverrisson et al. [21]. both treatments
showed no statistically significant differences in peak
and trough iop reduction, although additive use of pilocarpine seemed to be slightly more effective at trough
(reduction at peak:  xxxd3377xxx – xxxd1931xxx  16.4%,  xxxd3377xxx –
pilocarpine 14.8%; reduction at trough:  xxxd3377xxx –
 xxxd1931xxx  12%,  xxxd3377xxx –pilocarpine 14.9%). eighty
percent of patients preferred the fixed  xxxd3377xxx –
 xxxd1931xxx  combination, mainly because of fewer side
effects (91.5 to 69.1%) and higher convenience (49.1%).
the side effects of  xxxd3377xxx  and pilocarpine (visual disturbances, accommodative spasm, browache) limited
driving and reading. because of these effects, 33.7% of
patients discontinued the study early. although both
therapies showed comparable effects on iop, patients
preferred the fixed  xxxd3377xxx – xxxd1931xxx  combination for
its lesser impact on quality of life and its simple dosing
regime.
the available cais appear to have similar efficacy and
show a valuable additivity to other topical drugs.

side effects
side effects may be local or systemic. although systemic
cais exhibit rather strong systemic side effects and few
local side effects, the reverse is true for  xxxd1931xxx  and
 xxxd367xxx . these frequently induce burning, stinging, and taste alteration, which have been described elsewhere [2].
ocular discomfort could be due to a relatively low ph,
which is needed to render a drug such as  xxxd1931xxx 
(ph 5.5–5.8) water soluble.  xxxd367xxx , in contrast, is
formulated as a suspension at the physiologic ph of 7.5.
silver et al. [22] investigated whether  xxxd367xxx  improves ocular comfort, assessing the treatment of 213
primary open-angle glaucoma patients with  xxxd367xxx 
tid or  xxxd1931xxx  tid for 1 week. treatment with
 xxxd367xxx  resulted in a significantly lower ocular discomfort score (0.2–0.4 units) compared to treatment with
 xxxd1931xxx  (1.5–1.7 units). moreover, significantly
more patients treated with  xxxd367xxx  experienced no
discomfort (71–81%), compared to those treated with
 xxxd1931xxx  (17–20%). however, transient blurring of
vision occurred significantly more often in the brinzol-

update on topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors herkel and pfeiffer

amide group (20–25%) than in the  xxxd1931xxx  group
(3.7–3.8%). a study by sall et al. [9] confirmed these
findings. ocular discomfort after treatment with  xxxd367xxx  (3% of patients) was less frequent than after treatment with  xxxd1931xxx  (12.2% of patients). this could
result in better compliance with  xxxd367xxx  than with
 xxxd1931xxx .
corneal adverse events could be more severe. the corneal endothelium features two active pump mechanisms
to keep the cornea at a low degree of hydration, the
na/ka-atpase and the bicarbonate dependent mgatpase, which uses  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg295xxx . inhibition of the
latter pump by  xxxd1931xxx  might therefore lead to corneal edema. sugrue [23] showed that in rats the peak
concentration of  xxxd1931xxx  in the cornea was higher
than in the aqueous humor (85.3 µm vs 21.6 µm). in
addition, increased corneal thickness associated with
 xxxd1931xxx  treatment has been reported [24,25]. thus,
it is not surprising that reversible [1] and irreversible [26]
corneal decompensation occurred in patients using  xxxd1931xxx . however, all reported patients had undergone
intraocular surgery; most patients had had multiple surgeries, and four patients had had corneal transplantation
[27]. egan et al. [28] exposed the corneas of healthy persons treated for 1 day with either  xxxd1931xxx  or placebo
to hypoxic stress via hydrogel contact lenses. no difference could be found between the  xxxd1931xxx -treated
group and the placebo-treated group regarding the central corneal thickness and the deswelling rate. however,
glaucoma patients may have reduced endothelial cell
densities [29]. giasson et al. [30•] tested the corneal response to hypoxic stress of glaucoma and ocular hypertensive patients. after 1 year of  xxxd1931xxx  treatment
they found no difference to the baseline data. interestingly, the percentage of recovery per hour of the healthy
subjects in the egan study was higher than of the glaucoma patients in the giasson study. it appears that  xxxd1931xxx  does not compromise corneal function of
healthy eyes, but patients with corneal transplantation or
major corneal surgery should be monitored.
another tissue that could be affected by cais is the lens.
wistrand [31] reported that in human lenses  xxxg293xxx  is the
most abundant isozyme, having a concentration of 9 µg
per gram of wet weight. furthermore, almost all the catalytic activity of the ca in the lens originates from  xxxg293xxx .
in senile cataract lenses, wistrand did not find ca activity. however, no case of cataract formation has been
reported to follow either systemic or topical cai treatment. more conclusively, a  xxxg293xxx  deficiency syndrome
does not lead to cataract formation [32], making cataractogenic properties of cais unlikely.
interesting but unexplained is the report of seven cases
in which sterile mucopurulent conjunctivitis developed 1
to 21 months after  xxxd1931xxx  treatment was started

91

[33]. all were unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics and
showed negative bacterial cultures.  xxxd1931xxx  could
account for the conjunctivitis, because of a unilateral appearance when it was taken for one eye and the rapid
resolution of the conjunctivitis when the treatment was
discontinued.
three cases of nephrolithiasis associated with  xxxd1931xxx  treatment have been reported [34]. two patients
were young (aged 17 and 25 years), and the kidney
stones manifested 3 weeks to 8 months after initiation of
treatment. one kidney stone was found to consist of
calciumoxalate, which could be explained by caidependent alkalization of the urine, and subsequent formation of calciumoxalate and calciumphosphate.
when  xxxd1931xxx  was introduced, concern was raised
about idiosyncratic agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia, which have not been observed so far. pfeiffer [1]
pointed out that although these conditions are possible,
very low incidences should be expected, at least for the
dose-related forms. no metabolic acidosis or electrolyte
imbalances have been reported. thus, the safety profile
of topical cais appears to be reasonable.

ocular blood flow
several studies suggest that ischemia-promoting vascular
factors may contribute to glaucomatous damage, including vasospasm [35], impaired ocular perfusion pressure
[36], and general vascular disorders such as low blood
pressure, especially dips in blood pressure at night [37].
visual hemifield defects could be linked to corresponding peripapillary focal vessel narrowing [38]. furthermore, patients with progressing glaucoma showed a
lower enddiastolic velocity in the central retinal artery
than do healthy persons [39]. generally, cais are believed to increase co2 in tissue, and co2 then can act on
blood vessels to produce vasodilation. thus, systemic
acetazolamide has been shown to increase retinal blood
flow by 37% [40]. it is assumed that application of cais
lowers blood ph, activates the bohr shift, and pushes o2
off hemoglobin. several studies were performed to determine the influence of  xxxd1931xxx  on periocular and
retinal blood supply.
tamaki et al. [41] treated 11 rabbits for 20 days with
 xxxd1931xxx  1% bid and found no difference in in vivo
tissue blood flow velocity as compared to the untreated
contralateral eye, measured by using the laser speckle
method. likewise, healthy human subjects after 3 days
of  xxxd1931xxx  2% tid treatment did not exhibit a difference in the optic nerve blood flow [42] compared to
the placebo-treated group, neither measured by scanning
laser doppler flowmetry (hrf) nor laser doppler flowmetry. on examining glaucoma patients by color doppler imaging, martinez et al. [43] obtained different results: 2 hours after  xxxd1931xxx  application, the end-di-

astolic velocity of the central retinal artery increased
significantly in healthy and glaucomatous eyes, and the
resistance index of the ophthalmic and central retinal
artery decreased. although the peak systolic velocity of
the central retinal artery did not change in healthy subjects, it increased significantly in glaucomatous eyes.
an indirect measurement of the systolic peak flow is the
ocular pulse amplitude (opa), which represents the pulsatile amount of blood of the whole eye and is an estimate of choroidal perfusion. after administration of  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% bid to patients with glaucoma, the iop was
reduced. the opa, in contrast, remained unchanged at
2.1 ± 0.1 mmhg [44]. when  xxxd1931xxx  2% bid was
added, the opa increased significantly to 2.5 ± 0.2
mmhg (19%), and the iop was further reduced. thus,
 xxxd1931xxx  appears to increase opa. however, because
the choroidal blood flow is not autoregulated, the opa
should always increase when the iop is reduced.
after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with  xxxd1931xxx  2%
tid, patients with normal tension glaucoma showed a
significantly accelerated arteriovenous passage time on
fluorescein angiography, compared to placebo-treated
patients [45]. flow velocity in retrobulbar arteries was
not altered (resistance index, peak systolic velocity, and
enddiastolic velocity in the central retinal artery, nasal,
and temporal posterior ciliary arteries) measured with
color doppler imaging. the acceleration of the arteriovenous passage time could be reproduced at least for the
inferior temporal quadrant, and the effect was not seen
after topical betaxolol 0.5% bid [46]. however, the passage time only indirectly indicates enhanced retinal perfusion. moreover, accelerated transit in diabetic retinopathy could be associated with decreased nutrition delivery [47]. therefore, speed itself is not necessarily an
advantage.
to determine the oxygen delivery to the optic nerve
head, stefansson et al. [48•] measured the optic nerve
oxygen tension (onpo2) of pigs breathing different concentrations of o2, co2, and n2 by using an oxygen electrode placed 0.5 mm above the optic nerve head. when
breathing 21% o2 (n2 balanced), untreated pigs showed
an onpo2 of 21 mmhg. an addition of 5.19% co2 induced an increase of the onpo2 to 29 mmhg. a similar
onpo2 increase from 23.6 to 31 mmhg was seen when
500 mg acetazolamide were injected intravenously. an
even greater effect (increase from 16.4 to 26.9 mmhg)
was observed after injection of 500 mg  xxxd1931xxx . the
iop was fixed at 15 mmhg throughout the experiments.
the effect on the onpo2 showed a dose-response behavior (fig. 3). a similar increase in onpo2 from 29.3 to
32.6 mmhg was observed after topical application of  xxxd1931xxx  [49]. for the first time these studies offer evidence that cais have a direct effect on onpo2. however, it remains to be shown that an increase in onpo2

alters the course of glaucoma. if  xxxd1931xxx  should convey an effect to the posterior pole, it first needs to be
shown that  xxxd1931xxx , applied topically, reaches the
optic nerve vasculature in sufficient quantities. but most
important is to prove that patients with glaucoma do
profit from improved ocular blood flow.

conclusion and outlook
this review offers evidence that the topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx  are safe
and effective drugs with which to lower iop in glaucoma. additional benefits from potential improvement
of ocular blood flow need to be shown to be of significance in human chronic glaucoma. a major study [50]
now investigates if lowering of iop by use of the topical
cai  xxxd1931xxx  does prevent conversion from ocular
hypertension to chronic open-angle glaucoma. results
from this study could influence future management of
ocular hypertension.
