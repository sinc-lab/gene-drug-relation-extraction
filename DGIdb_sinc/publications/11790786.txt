cancer, mmps are known to be required at all stages of tumorigenesis, including tumor establishment and growth, neovascularization, intravasation, extravasation, and metastasis (1,
2). mmps are expressed as zymogenic latent enzymes. the
zymogenic form has a propeptide that achieves coordination to
the catalytic zinc ion by a strictly conserved cysteine residue
(for a comparative review of mmp structures see ref. 3). mmp
activation occurs when the cysteine thiolate-zinc ion coordination is broken, usually as a consequence of two proteolytic
cleavages of the propeptide, either by autolysis or by hydrolytic
action of other proteinases (4 – 6). mmps are inhibited by the
tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (timps), a family of four
proteins that are the natural inhibitors of mmps.
a subgroup of the mmp family, gelatinases a and b ( xxxg1428xxx 
and  xxxg1440xxx , respectively), has been shown to play a key role in
angiogenesis and tumor metastasis (7, 8).  xxxg1428xxx  has been the
subject of intense investigation since the observation was made
that its activation correlates with tumor spread and poor prognosis (9). latent  xxxg1428xxx  (pro- xxxg1428xxx ) is activated by membrane-type mmps (mt-mmps) (10, 11), a unique mmp subfamily currently comprising six members (mt1- to  xxxg1433xxx ).
contrary to the other mmps, which are secreted into the extracellular milieu, the mt-mmps are tethered to the plasma
membrane either by a transmembrane domain (mt1-, mt2-,
mt-3 and  xxxg1432xxx ) or by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (mt4- and  xxxg1433xxx ).  xxxg1423xxx  ( xxxg1423xxx ) (12) is
known to be the primary pro- xxxg1428xxx  physiological activator
through a highly regulated mechanism (13) involving timp-2
(14). it has been shown that timp-2 binds active  xxxg1423xxx 
through the n-terminal cysteine residue (15, 16), whereas the
c-terminal domain of timp-2 interacts with the hemopexinlike domain of pro- xxxg1428xxx  (17), forming a ternary complex (18)
that efficiently concentrates pro- xxxg1428xxx  on the cell surface,
thereby promoting its interaction with a neighboring timp-2free  xxxg1423xxx .  xxxg1423xxx  cleaves pro- xxxg1428xxx  at the asn37–
leu38 peptide bond, generating an inactive 64-kda intermediate. subsequently, a second autolytic cleavage at asn80–tyr81
bond achieves the full activation of pro- xxxg1428xxx  (19). this process requires protonation of the coordinated cysteine thiolate
before its dissociation from the active site zinc ion (6).
the key role that mmps play in neovascularization and
metastasis has made these enzymes major targets for therapeutic intervention, and therefore synthetic small molecular
weight mmp inhibitors are highly sought. several orally active
mmp inhibitors were synthesized and tested in animal models
yielding encouraging results (20, 21). some of these mmp inhibitors, including the broad-spectrum hydroxamate-based  xxxd287xxx  and marimastat (22, 23), reached phase 3 of clinical
trials. however, administration of these inhibitors, either alone
or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents, to

gelatinases have been shown to play a key role in
angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. small molecular
weight synthetic inhibitors for these enzymes are highly
sought for potential use as anti-metastatic agents. virtually all of the known inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are broad spectrum. we report herein
the synthesis and kinetic characterization of two compounds, 4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane-1,2-dithiol
(compound 1) and 5-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)pentane1,2-dithiol (compound 2), that are potent and selective
gelatinase inhibitors. these compounds are slow, tightbinding inhibitors of gelatinases ( xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx )
with ki values in the nanomolar range. in contrast, competitive inhibition of the catalytic domain of membranetype 1 metalloproteinase (mmp-14cat) with comparable
ki values (ki ⬃200 nm) was observed. binding to stromelysin ( xxxg1437xxx ) was substantially weaker, with ki values
in the micromolar range (ki ⬃10 ␮m). no binding to
 xxxg1438xxx  ( xxxg1438xxx ) and collagenase 1 ( xxxg1418xxx ) was detected at inhibitor concentrations up to 60 ␮m. we have
previously shown that synthetic mmp inhibitors work
synergistically with timp-2 in the promotion of prommp-2 activation by  xxxg1423xxx  in a process that depends on the affinity of the inhibitor toward  xxxg1423xxx .
it is shown herein that the dithiols are significantly less
efficient (>100-fold) than marimastat, a broad-spectrum
mmp inhibitor, in enhancing pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation in
cells infected to express  xxxg1423xxx , consistent with the
lower affinity of the dithiols toward  xxxg1423xxx . thus, in
contrast to broad-spectrum mmp inhibitors, the dithiols
are less likely to promote  xxxg1423xxx -dependent prommp-2 activation in the presence of timp-2, while maintaining their ability to inhibit active  xxxg1428xxx  effectively.

experimental procedures

synthesis—1h and 13c nmr spectra were recorded on either a varian gemini-300, a varian mercury-400, or a varian unity-500 spectrometer. chemical shifts are reported in ppm from tetramethylsilane
on the ␦ scale. infrared spectra were recorded on a nicolet 680 dsp
spectrophotometer. mass spectra were recorded on a kratos ms 80rft
spectrometer. melting points were taken on an electrothermal melting
point apparatus and are uncorrected. thin-layer chromatography was
performed with whatman 0.25-mm silica gel 60-f plates. all other
reagents were purchased from either aldrich or across organics. 2-(4phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)ethylthiirane and 3-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)propylthiirane were prepared according to the method reported
previously (28).
4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane-1,2-dithiol—a solution of sodium
hydrosulfide (13 mg, 0.18 mmol) in methanol (0.5 ml) was cooled to 0 °c.
hydrogen sulfide gas was then bubbled slowly through the solution for
5 min. to this solution was added 2-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)ethylthiirane (39 mg, 0.12 mmol) in chloroform/methanol (1:2, 0.8 ml) over a
period of 10 min, with continuous bubbling of hydrogen sulfide. this
mixture was stirred at 0 °c for a further 30 min and then at room
temperature for 2 h. the reaction mixture was poured into water (20
ml) and then acidified with a few drops of  xxxd3258xxx  (1 m) before
extraction with ether (3 ⫻ 10 ml). the combined organic extracts were
dried over  xxxd2534xxx  and concentrated to give the desired

5-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)pentane-1,2-dithiol—this material was
prepared in the same manner as 4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane1,2-dithiol with the exception that 3-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)propylthiirane was used in place of 2-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)ethylthiirane.

cell culture—hela s3 cells were obtained from american type
culture collection (attc, manassas, va) (ccl-2.2) and grown in
suspension in mem spinner (quality biologicals, inc., gaithersburg,
md) supplemented with 5% horse serum. nonmalignant monkey kidney epithelial bs-c-1 (ccl-26) cells were obtained from the attc and
cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. all tissue culture reagents
were purchased from invitrogen.
recombinant vaccinia viruses—recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing either bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase (vtf7–3) or  xxxg1423xxx  (vtf-mt1) under the t7 promoter were produced by homologous
recombination as described previously (27, 30 –32).
recombinant proteins, enzymes, and protein inhibitors—human recombinant pro- xxxg1428xxx , pro- xxxg1440xxx , timp-1, and timp-2 were expressed in hela s3 cells infected with the corresponding recombinant
vaccinia viruses and purified to homogeneity as previously described
(17). heat-activated human  xxxg1437xxx  ( xxxg1437xxx ) was generously
provided by dr. paul cannon (center for bone and joint research, palo
alto, ca). pro- xxxg1428xxx  and pro- xxxg1440xxx  were activated by incubation
with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate and heat-activated  xxxg1437xxx ,
respectively, as described previously (28). the recombinant catalytic
domain of human  xxxg1423xxx  (mmp-14cat) encompassing residues
ile114–ile318 expressed in escherichia coli (33), was a generous gift from
dr. harald tschesche (university of bielefeld, bielefeld, germany).
recombinant human active  xxxg1438xxx  ( xxxg1438xxx ) was obtained from
chemicon (temecula, ca). human recombinant  xxxg1418xxx 
(pro- xxxg1418xxx ) was a generous gift from dr. william parks (washington
university, st. louis, mo). pro- xxxg1418xxx  was activated by incubation
with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (1 mm) in a buffer consisting of 0.1
m tris, 10 mm cacl2, ph 7.5. the concentrations of heat-activated
 xxxg1437xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were determined by active site titration with
recombinant timp-1, whereas  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1438xxx , and mt1-mmpcat concentrations were obtained by titration with recombinant timp-2. the
hydroxamate-based inhibitors marimastat ( xxxd2544xxx ) and  xxxd287xxx 
( xxxd287xxx ) were obtained from british biotech (annapolis, md). stock
solutions of marimastat,  xxxd287xxx , and the dithiol compounds were
prepared in me2so in the millimolar concentration range.
fluorescence enzymatic activity assays—fluorescence was measured with a pti spectrofluorometer (photon technology international)
interfaced to a pentium computer equipped with radiomastertm and
felixtm hardware and software, respectively. the assays were carried
out at 25.0 °c, and the cuvette holder was thermostatted at the same
temperature. excitation and emission band passes of 1 and 3 nm,
respectively, were used. fluorescence measurements were taken every
4 s.  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx ,  xxxg1438xxx , and  xxxg1423xxx  activities were monitored
with the fluorescence-quenched substrate mocacplgla2pr(dnp)arnh2 at excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 393 nm, respectively. mocacrpkpve(nva)wrk(dnp)nh2 was the fluorogenic substrate used to monitor  xxxg1437xxx  enzymatic activity at 325 and 393 nm.
 xxxg1418xxx  activity was assayed with the fluorogenic synthetic substrate
(dnp)p(cha)gc(me)hak(nma)nh2 at 340 and 440 nm. all fluorogenic
substrates were obtained from peptides international, inc. (louisville,
ky). less than 10% hydrolysis of the substrates was monitored as
described by knight (34). the assays were performed as described
previously (35).
enzyme inhibition studies—progress curves for slow-binding inhibition analysis were obtained by adding enzyme (0.5–1 nm) to a mixture
of mocacplgla2pr(dnp)ar-nh2(7 ␮m) and varying concentrations of
the dithiol inhibitors in buffer r (50 mm hepes (ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl,
5 mm cacl2, 0.01% brij-35, and 5% me2so; final volume 2 ml) in acrylic
cuvettes with stirring. hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate was

cancer patients produced severe side effects and showed no
clinical efficacy. the current view is that these trials were
misguided because the subjects had pre-existing metastasis
and improved survival rates should not have been anticipated
(24). on the other hand, a recent study (25) demonstrated that
 xxxd287xxx  administration led to liver metastasis in mice inoculated with human breast carcinoma cells. results from our
laboratories (26) showed that both  xxxd287xxx  and marimastat,
in concert with timp-2, enhanced  xxxg1423xxx -dependent prommp-2 activation when compared with the activation observed
with timp-2 alone. on the cell membrane, active  xxxg1423xxx 
(57 kda) undergoes autolysis and shedding of the catalytic
domain, yielding a major membrane-bound species of 44 kda,
which is devoid of proteolytic activity (27). binding of timp-2
or of a synthetic mmp inhibitor to active  xxxg1423xxx  prevents
autolysis, resulting in accumulation of enzyme on the cell surface. we have shown that in the presence of timp-2 accumulation of active  xxxg1423xxx  by synthetic mmp inhibitors can
generate mt1-mmp䡠timp-2 complexes on the cell surface,
which then promote pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation (26). thus, under
certain conditions, synthetic mmp inhibitors with high affinity
toward  xxxg1423xxx  can enhance the effects of timp-2 in prommp-2 activation by  xxxg1423xxx . we have recently reported
the first mechanism-based inhibitor (“suicide substrate”) for
mmps, sb-3ct (28, 29), which exhibits high selectivity for the
gelatinases but poor affinity for  xxxg1423xxx . consistently, sb3ct does not enhance the  xxxg1423xxx -mediated activation of
pro- xxxg1428xxx  in the presence of timp-2 (26). thus, selective
inhibitors for gelatinases may have clinical advantages by reducing side effects and improving efficacy. we report herein the
synthesis and kinetic characterization of two novel inhibitors,
4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane-1,2-dithiol (1) and 5-(4phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)pentane-1,2-dithiol (2), which also exhibit selectivity toward gelatinases. however, their mechanisms of inhibition are different. a comparative study of these
compounds on the activation of pro- xxxg1428xxx  in cells expressing
 xxxg1423xxx  shows that, when compared with marimastat, significantly higher dithiol concentrations are required for active
 xxxg1423xxx  binding and enhancement of pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation
in the presence of timp-2. moreover, at higher concentrations
both marimastat and the dithiols inhibit  xxxg1428xxx , leading to
accumulation of the 64-kda  xxxg1428xxx  inactive intermediate and
preventing further  xxxg1428xxx  generation.

cell infection, treatment with synthetic inhibitors, and pro- xxxg1428xxx 
activation—to express  xxxg1423xxx , ⬃90% confluent bs-c-1 cells cultured in 6-well plates were co-infected with 5 plaque-forming units/cell
each of vtf7–3 and vtf-mt1 viruses for 45 min in infection medium
(dmem supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) at
37 °c. after infection the cells were rinsed with serum-free dmem
supplemented with l-glutamine and antibiotics and incubated in the
same medium containing varying concentrations of synthetic inhibitors. after ⬃16 h the inhibitor-containing media were aspirated, and
the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with opti-mem, without phenol red, supplemented with prommp-2 (25 nm). at varying times, media aliquots were removed and
 xxxg1428xxx  activity was assayed with mocacplgla2pr(dnp)ar-nh2, as
described (35). after 4 – 6 h the remaining media were collected, and the
cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed
with cold lysis buffer (25 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 1% igepal ca-630,
100 mm nacl) containing protease inhibitors (1 pellet of complete mini,
edta-free protease inhibitor mixture from roche diagnostics/10 ml of
buffer). the media and lysate samples were analyzed for pro- xxxg1428xxx 
cleavage by gelatin zymography. the lysates were also subjected to
immunoblot analysis to ascertain the level of  xxxg1423xxx  expression and
processing as described below.
gelatin zymography and immunoblot analysis—gelatin zymography was performed using 8% tris-glycine sds-polyacrylamide gels
containing 0.1% gelatin under nonreducing conditions as described
previously (38). the samples for immunoblot analysis were subjected to
reducing sds-page followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes.
the transferred proteins were developed using rabbit polyclonal antibody 437 to  xxxg1423xxx  (39). horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit
igg (immunopurer, pierce) was the secondary antibody used. detection
was performed using supersignalr enhanced chemiluminescence substrate for horseradish peroxidase, with west pico or femto sensitivity,
according to the manufacturer’s (pierce) instructions.
results

design and synthesis of 4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane1,2-dithiol (1) and 5-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)pentane-1,2-di-

thiol (2)—thiolates are the best ligands for zinc ions, a factor
that has been used in designing enzyme inhibitors (40 – 48). a
report for a dithiol inhibitor of vanx, a bacterial zinc-dependent d,d-dipeptidase, was published recently (49), which
prompted us to consider the issue of chelation of the active site
zinc ion in  xxxg1428xxx  by dithiol inhibitors. the dithiol inhibitors
for vanx were slow-binding inhibitors. in slow-binding inhibition, inhibitor binding initiates a conformational change that
results in an enzyme-inhibitor complex that resists dissociation. as a result of the interactions that initiate the onset of the
conformational change, and the difficulty of its reversal, slowbinding inhibitors can afford excellent selectivity in inhibition
of closely related enzymes. this will be of great interest to the
study of inhibition of mmps, because their active sites are
extremely similar to one another.
dithiol inhibitors 1 and 2 were designed based on our knowledge of the binding interactions of the thiirane mechanismbased inhibitors (suicide substrates) that we developed for gelatinases (28, 29) although the mechanisms for inhibition of the
two classes of inhibitors are very different. the biphenyl moiety
in these inhibitors fits well in the s1⬘ subsite of  xxxg1428xxx .
the oxygens of the sulfone make hydrogen bonds to the backbone amines of leu191 and ala192. sequestration of the inhibitor in the active site brings the thiols close to the coordination
environment of the zinc ion (scheme 1).

scheme 1

we synthesized thiiranes 3 and 4 in six steps according to
reported procedures (28). the thiirane moiety in each case was
opened by reaction with sodium hydrosulfide to afford the
desired dithiols 1 and 2 in excellent yields (scheme 2).

scheme 2

compounds 1 and 2 as selective gelatinase inhibitors—as
shown in fig. 1 and table i, compounds 1 and 2 are slowbinding inhibitors of only  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  with ki values in
the nanomolar range (46 –260 nm). these compounds also inhibited mmp-14cat with similar affinity (ki ⬃200 nm), although
we observed only a competitive mechanism for inhibition in
this case. on the other hand,  xxxg1437xxx  was inhibited at significantly higher inhibitor concentrations (ki of 10 ⫾ 2 and 4.4 ⫾
0.8 ␮m for compounds 1 and 2, respectively), whereas for  xxxg1438xxx  ( xxxg1438xxx ) and collagenase-1 ( xxxg1418xxx ), activities remained unchanged in the presence of inhibitor concentrations
up to 60 ␮m. no significant difference in affinity or mechanism
of inhibition was detected between the two compounds. thus,
the dithiols exhibit selectivity toward gelatinases and  xxxg1423xxx , and the binding affinity of the enzymes tested is independent of the length of the backbone of the molecules. it is
important to note that the values for koff for both inhibitors
with either of the gelatinases are slow (10⫺3 s⫺1) and those for
kon are very favorable (104-105 m⫺1 s⫺1); hence the inhibitors
are extremely effective in targeting gelatinases.

the km values used for the reaction of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  with the
fluorogenic substrate were 2.46 ⫾ 0.34 and 3.06 ⫾ 0.74 ␮m, respectively
(17). intercept and slope values, obtained by linear regression of the k
versus inhibitor concentration plot (eq. 2), yielded the association and
dissociation rate constants kon and koff, respectively, and the inhibition
constant ki (koff/kon). alternatively, ki was determined from the slope of
the (vo ⫺ vs)/vs versus [i] plot according to equation 3. the dissociation
rate constants were determined independently from the enzyme activity recovered after dilution of a preformed enzyme-inhibitor complex.
thus, 200 – 400 nm enzyme was incubated with ⬃100 ␮m inhibitor for at
least 45 min at 25.0 °c. the complex was diluted 400-fold into 2 ml of
buffer r containing fluorogenic substrate (10 ␮m final concentration).
recovery of enzyme activity was monitored for 60 min. the data were
analyzed as described elsewhere (26, 28). for competitive inhibition,
the initial rates were obtained by adding enzyme (0.5 nm) to a mixture
of fluorogenic substrate (7 ␮m) and varying concentrations of inhibitor
in buffer r (final volume 1 ml) in quartz semi-micro cuvettes and
monitoring the increase in fluorescence with time for 5–10 min. the
initial velocities were determined by linear regression analysis of the
fluorescence versus time traces using felixtm. the initial rates were
fitted to equation 4 (37), where vi and vo represent the initial velocity in
the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively, using the program
scientist.

concert with timp-2 enhances pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation mediated
by  xxxg1423xxx , a process that is related to its ability to stabilize
 xxxg1423xxx . because the affinities of both the gelatinases and
 xxxg1423xxx  for the dithiol inhibitors are poorer in comparison
with marimastat (fig. 2 and earlier reports (26, 50)), they are
expected to be less efficient than marimastat at promoting
activation of pro- xxxg1428xxx  in the presence of  xxxg1423xxx  and
timp-2. to test this hypothesis, bs-c-1 cells, which express
endogenous timp-2, were infected to express  xxxg1423xxx  and
incubated with various concentrations of either inhibitor 1
(0 –1000 ␮m) or marimastat (0 –10 ␮m) to stabilize  xxxg1423xxx 
on the cell surface. the cells were subsequently examined for
their ability to activate exogenously administered pro- xxxg1428xxx .
as shown in fig. 3, enhanced pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation on cells
that were incubated with inhibitor 1 was noticeable at 100 ␮m
inhibitor. in contrast, a comparable amount of  xxxg1428xxx  generation was detected at ⬃100-fold lower marimastat concentrations (1 ␮m). this effect correlated with the differential affinity
of the inhibitors for  xxxg1423xxx  because, as shown by immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates (fig. 3), marimastat promoted
the accumulation of the 57-kda active form of  xxxg1423xxx  at
⬃100-fold lower concentrations than compound 1. both inhibitor 1 and marimastat appear to bind active  xxxg1428xxx , thereby
inhibiting pro- xxxg1428xxx  autolytic activation step as evidenced by
the accumulation of the 64-kda  xxxg1428xxx  intermediate at the
high end of the concentration range used. this effect was apparent at significantly higher concentrations of compound 1
relative to marimastat (⬃100-fold), which correlates with the
inhibitors differential affinities for active  xxxg1428xxx .
discussion

we have designed, synthesized, and kinetically characterized two novel small molecular weight synthetic inhibitors for
mmps. these compounds were shown to be tight, slow-binding
inhibitors for gelatinases, with ki values in the nanomolar
range. the inhibitors contain a dithiol moiety that was expected to interact with the active site zinc ion to give enzyme
inhibition. although the principles that facilitate the manifestation of slow-binding inhibition remain unclear, such inhibition can have important implications for selectivity in targeting
closely related enzymes such as mmps. the rationale is as
follows. the inhibitor needs to bind the enzyme effectively to

begin with. on binding, the conformational change that is
implicit for the slow-binding behavior would ensue to give the
final enzyme-inhibitor complex. whether this conformational
change would take place or not is a function of specific interactions between the inhibitor and the active site. in essence,
small changes of the surface features of the active site could
make a significant difference in the rate constants for the onset
of slow-binding behavior. this is most likely at the root of the
selectivity that we observe in inhibition of gelatinases with
compounds 1 and 2. not only are the ki values for gelatinases
in the nanomolar range, it is only with gelatinases that the
slow-binding behavior is seen. one observes only simple competitive inhibition of the closely related  xxxg1437xxx  but with ki
values in the micromolar range. again, despite high similarities in the active sites of other mmps such as  xxxg1418xxx  and
 xxxg1438xxx , we did not observe inhibition at concentrations of the
inhibitors as high as 60 ␮m. on the other hand, the catalytic
domain of  xxxg1423xxx  showed affinity for the inhibitors (ki ⬃200
nm), but the inhibitors behaved as simple competitive inhibitors of this enzyme.
the previously reported mechanism-based inhibitor, sb3ct, exhibited a higher degree of selectivity and was capable of
discriminating between  xxxg1428xxx  (ki ⫽ 14 ⫾ 4 nm) and  xxxg1440xxx 
(ki ⫽ 600 ⫾ 200 nm). contrary to the case of the thiirane
inhibitors, which showed very strict limitations on structure
variation (28), the length of the dithiol side chains (4 or 5
carbons) practically did not affect their binding behavior with
gelatinases.
the dithiols exhibit high affinity for gelatinases ( xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx ), two enzymes that have been associated with pathogenesis of various human pathological conditions. therefore,
selective inhibition of these enzymes with dithiol-like inhibitors represents an advantage over broad-spectrum mmp inhibitors. like most mmps, gelatinases are produced in a latent
form that is activated by a proteolytic cascade, generally involving the action of other mmps acting as zymogen activators.
for example,  xxxg1437xxx  and  xxxg1423xxx  (4, 12) are the major
activators of pro- xxxg1440xxx  and pro- xxxg1428xxx , respectively. synthetic mmp inhibitors, depending on their affinities, may influence the process of zymogen activation. indeed, we have
previously shown that high-affinity synthetic mmp inhibitors

zymography. the lysates were subjected to gelatin zymography and reducing 12% sds-page followed by immunoblot analysis using the
anti- xxxg1423xxx  polyclonal antibody 437. note that in the lower left panel an additional minor  xxxg1423xxx  species of ⬃62 kda is detected, which

slow-binding inhibitors of gelatinases
 xxxg1440xxx  activation cannot be envisioned. on the other hand,
pro- xxxg1440xxx , as a soluble mmp, may be activated efficiently in
the extracellular space, for example, by  xxxg1437xxx  among other
possible activators. kinetically,  xxxg1437xxx  is an efficient prommp-9 activator (35), a process that is accomplished by two
consecutive  xxxg1437xxx  cleavages at the propeptide region (4). as
poor inhibitors of  xxxg1437xxx  (ki ⫽ 4 –10 ␮m), the dithiols are not
expected to alter the rate of pro- xxxg1440xxx  activation but rather to
specifically inhibit active  xxxg1440xxx , achieving desirable enzyme
targeting. broad-spectrum inhibitors like marimastat are
likely to diminish pro- xxxg1440xxx  activation by affecting  xxxg1437xxx 
and thus achieve less selectivity but a broader neutralizing
effect. thus, in clinical applications inhibitor selectivity and
dosage will be crucial in determining the final outcome of the
application.

like marimastat can act synergistically with timp-2 in promoting pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation by  xxxg1423xxx  (26). this effect is
mediated at least in part by the stabilization of active  xxxg1423xxx  on the cell surface by the action of the inhibitor. assuming that a fraction of the surface enzyme is free of inhibitor and
that the cells continue to produce and activate pro- xxxg1423xxx ,
the accumulated enzyme would form complexes with timp-2,
which in turn would enhance pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation. alternatively, displacement of mt1-mmp䡠synthetic inhibitor complexes by timp-2 would also generate additional mt1mmp䡠timp-2 complexes for pro- xxxg1428xxx  binding and
consequent activation. such an effect would be undesirable in
tissues, because it would favor pericellular proteolysis. it is
therefore important to design mmp inhibitors that exhibit
selectivity, to prevent this potential side effect. in this report,
we have shown that both the dithiols and marimastat enhance
activation of pro- xxxg1428xxx  by  xxxg1423xxx  in bs-c-1 cells, which
express low amounts of endogenous timp-2 (26). however, by
exhibiting ⬃100-fold lower affinity for  xxxg1423xxx  than marimastat, the dithiols are significantly less efficient in enhancing
the effects of timp-2 on pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation, requiring at
least 100 ␮m to achieve an activation comparable with 1 ␮m
marimastat. this was consistent with the differential effects of
the inhibitors on the stabilization of active  xxxg1423xxx  on the
cell surface. previous studies have shown that  xxxg1423xxx 
cleaves pro- xxxg1428xxx  at the asn37–leu38 peptide bond present in
the propeptide region, generating an inactive 64-kda intermediate (19). full pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation requires autolytic processing of a second scissile bond at asn80–tyr81. the formation
of ternary (mt1-mmp䡠timp-2䡠pro- xxxg1428xxx ) complexes on the
cell surface concentrates pro- xxxg1428xxx , thus favoring the second
autolytic step. we have observed herein that the dithiols, as
well as marimastat, inhibit the second activation step, inducing
accumulation of the inactive  xxxg1428xxx  intermediate at the highest inhibitor concentrations. however, given the higher affinity
of  xxxg1428xxx  for marimastat, lower concentrations of this inhibitor were required to observe this effect. accumulation of the
intermediate form of  xxxg1428xxx  is likely a consequence of the
inhibition of the fully active  xxxg1428xxx  required for the second
autolytic step. the synthetic inhibitors characterized herein
and the system used to test their effects in live cells illustrate
the complex regulation of mmp proteolytic activity and the
different outcomes that different inhibitors may have depending on their binding affinities and selectivity for the various
mmps. thus, inhibitors with high affinity for  xxxg1423xxx , like
marimastat, may generate, at relatively low concentrations, a
“pool” of active  xxxg1423xxx , thereby promoting pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation. marimastat is also an effective  xxxg1428xxx  inhibitor, thus
binding the generated active  xxxg1428xxx  and preventing further
pro- xxxg1428xxx  full activation and pericellular proteolysis. it is
noteworthy that a decline in inhibitor concentration may reverse both of these effects. thus, although marimastat enhances activation through its effect on  xxxg1423xxx , it will reduce  xxxg1428xxx  activity by inhibiting the second activation step.
furthermore, by stabilizing  xxxg1423xxx  on the cell surface,
marimastat may indirectly contribute to the overall activity of
this enzyme on the cell surface, under conditions of low inhibitor concentrations. selective inhibitors for  xxxg1428xxx , in contrast
to broad-spectrum inhibitors, are less likely to bind  xxxg1423xxx 
and promote pro- xxxg1428xxx  activation.
 xxxg1440xxx  is also inhibited by the dithiols with high affinity and
with a slow-binding mode of inhibition, consistent with the
high degree of homology that exists between the catalytic sites
of the gelatinases. however, in contrast to pro- xxxg1428xxx , a cellular mechanism of pro- xxxg1440xxx  activation has not been identified yet. therefore, an analogous effect of the dithiols on pro-
