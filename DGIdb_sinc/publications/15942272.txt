introduction

histamine has been recognized as a major mediator in
allergic reactions and diseases [1], and it is widely accepted that histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists are important agents in the treatment of allergic diseases [2]. histamine increases the release of a number of cytokines that
might contribute to allergic inﬂammation [3]. histamine
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists might have effects other than
simple antagonism of the histamine receptor, with important actions on the inhibition of mediator release and
blockade of cellular recruitment and activation.
atopic dermatitis (ad), allergic contact dermatitis,
and psoriasis vulgaris are the most common skin diseases.
ad is a chronically relapsing inﬂammatory skin disease
characterized by episodes of intense pruritus, multiple
lesions with erythema, excoriation, erosions, licheniﬁcation, papules, dry skin, and susceptibility to cutaneous
infection. the ﬁrst-line treatment regimen for the eczematous lesions of ad is the topical application of steroids

abstract
histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists have long been prescribed for atopic dermatitis as an adjuvant therapy with
topical therapy by local applied steroids. olopatadine is
one of the second-generation histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists that are treated for allergic disorders. we investigated that the effect of olopatadine on oxazoloneinduced chronic contact hypersensitivity response in
balb/c mice compared with other histamine  xxxg1078xxx 
antagonists loratadine, cetirizine and fexofenadine. the
chronic contact hypersensitivity induced by repeated application of oxazolone was treated with olopatadine and
other histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists at the effective
doses on histamine-induced paw edema in mice. the effects of these drugs in the oxazolone-induced model
were quantified by measurements of ear swelling, and
levels of cytokines in the lesioned ear. olopatadine significantly inhibited the ear swelling and the increased
production of il-4, il-1, il-6, gm-csf and ngf in the
lesioned ear. on the other hand, the other histamine h1
receptor antagonists did not significantly suppress the
increase in ear thickness. moreover, they did not affect

materials and methods
animals
male 6-week-old balb/c mice were purchased from charles
river japan (kanagawa, japan). the animals were kept in the speciﬁc pathogen-free animal facility that maintained temperature of

46

pharmacology 2005;75:45–52

19–25 ° c, humidity of 30–70%, and a 12-hour day/night cycle, and
were given access to food and water ad libitum. the experiments
were conducted in accordance with the guiding principles for the
care and use of laboratory animals, and the experimental protocol used in this study was approved by the committee for animal
experiments in kyowa hakko kogyo co., ltd (shizuoka, japan).
drugs
olopatadine hydrochloride (olopatadine) was synthesized in
yokkaichi plant, kyowa yuka co., ltd (mie, japan). cetirizine
hydrochloride (cetirizine) and  xxxd2103xxx  (fexofenadine) were synthesized or extracted from the commercially
available tablets in our institute. loratadine was purchased from
pharm chemical shanghai lansheng (shanghai, china), and chlorpheniramine maleate salt (chlorpheniramine), prednisolone, histamine dihydrochloride (histamine) and 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one (oxazolone) were from sigma chemical (st.
louis, mo., usa). olopatadine, cetirizine and chlorpheniramine
were dissolved in distilled water. loratadine and fexofenadine were
suspended in 0.5 w/v%  xxxd2609xxx  solution. prednisolone and
oxazolone were dissolved in acetone.
histamine-induced paw edema
histamine-induced paw edema was conducted according to the
method of barnett et al. [14]. eight balb/c mice in a group were
injected with 13 g of 25 l histamine in saline into the right hind
paw and 25 l saline into the left hind paw under light ether anesthesia. the paw thickness was measured 30 min after the injection,
using a dial thickness gauge (peacock; model g-1a, ozaki corp.,
tokyo, japan). the difference in thickness between both paws was
indicated as the swelling, and the % inhibition of each drug on the
histamine-induced paw edema was calculated. each drug was orally administered 1 h before the injection at a volume of 1 ml/100 g
body weight.
oxazolone-induced chronic contact hypersensitivity
response
balb/c mice were sensitized and challenged with oxazolone as
described previously [13]. using 8 mice in each group, the same
skin site of the right ear was sensitized by a single application of
10 l of 0.5 w/v% oxazolone in acetone 7 days before the ﬁrst challenge (day 0) and 10 l of 0.5 w/v% oxazolone in acetone was repeatedly applied to the sensitized right ear 3 times per week. in the
non-sensitized animals, acetone alone was applied to the right ear.
olopatadine was orally administered at 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day, loratadine, cetirizine and chlorpheniramine were orally administered at
10 mg/kg/day, fexofenadine was orally administered at 50 mg/kg/
day, and prednisolone was topically applied at 0.05 mg/ear/day to
the right ear. olopatadine, loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine and
chlorpheniramine were orally administered at a volume of 1 ml/
100 g body weight. prednisolone was applied at a volume of 10 l/
ear. each drug was administered once daily from day 0 to 16. on
the day of oxazolone challenge, each drug was administered 1 h
before the challenge. the changes in the ear thickness were measured with a dial thickness gauge (peacock; model g-1a). at 24 h
after the ﬁnal challenge, blood was collected for measurement of
serum ige, and the animals in each group were sacriﬁced to remove
the ears. each ear sample was homogenized and centrifuged, and
then the supernatant was stored at –80 ° c until the cytokine assay.

and emollients. on the other hand, oral histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists have long been prescribed for ad as
an adjunct therapy with topical agents, in the belief that
they reduce pruritus by blocking the action of histamine
in the skin [2, 4].
olopatadine hydrochloride (olopatadine: 11-[(z)-3(dimethylamino)propylidene]-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid monohydrochloride) (allelock®,
kyowa hakko kogyo co., ltd, japan) is a selective and
potent histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist with no anticholinergic effect, and it is widely used for allergic rhinitis,
chronic urticaria, eczema dermatitis, prurigo, pruritis cutaneous, psoriasis vulgaris and erythema exsudativum
multiform [5]. in addition to its potent histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonistic effect, previous studies have demonstrated that olopatadine inhibits the release of tachykinin
[6], interleukin (il)-6, il-8 [7] and  xxxg2296xxx - [8].
genetic, environmental, skin barrier, pharmacological, psychological and immunological factors are involved
in the pathogenesis of ad [9]. in particular, the t-helper
(th)2 cells accumulated in the lesioned skin of ad are
thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of the
dermatitis [10]. webb et al. [11] and kitagaki et al. [12]
have examined the cutaneous cytokine proﬁle in the mice
exposed to repeated application of hapten, and observed
the shift in the local cytokine pattern from a th1- to a
th2-type proﬁle. since most of these ﬁndings are also observed in patients with ad, the mouse models appear to
mimic many, if not all, events occurring within the lesioned skin of patients with ad. we recently have reported that olopatadine mitigates the cutaneous inﬂammation in a mouse model of chronic inﬂammatory dermatitis induced by repeated challenge of hapten to the ear
[13].
the purpose of present study was to determine the effect of olopatadine in a mouse model of chronic inﬂammatory dermatitis induced by repeated challenge of oxazolone to the skin compared with other histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine
and chlorpheniramine. we examined whether olopatadine appeared to exert additional biological effects besides its blockade of a histamine  xxxg1078xxx .

results

effects on the histamine-induced paw edema
effects of olopatadine and other histamine  xxxg1078xxx 
antagonists on the histamine-induced paw edema were
examined by oral administration (ﬁg. 1). olopatadine at
0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg signiﬁcantly suppressed the increase
in paw thickness by 33.9, 62.0 and 72.7%, respectively.
loratadine (0.1–10 mg/kg), cetirizine (0.1–10 mg/kg),
fexofenadine (5–150 mg/kg) and chlorpheniramine (3–
30 mg/kg) also signiﬁcantly suppressed the histamine-induced paw edema.
effects on the ear thickness after repeated
challenge with oxazolone
olopatadine and other histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists at the effective doses in the histamine-induced paw
edema were investigated on the ear thickness after repeated challenge with oxazolone.
in the oxazolone-challenged group, the ear thickness
signiﬁcantly increased from day 1 throughout the experimental period. olopatadine at 1 mg/kg/day signiﬁcantly
suppressed the increase in ear thickness at days 9 and 12,
at 3 mg/kg/day signiﬁcantly suppressed it at days 5, 8, 9,
12, 15 and 16, and  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg/day signiﬁcantly suppressed it at days 4, 5 and 8–16, respectively (ﬁg. 2a).
loratadine suppressed it at days 5, 8 and 12 (ﬁg. 2b); ce-

individual mouse ears were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.4; icn biomedicals, aurora, ohio, usa) containing the protease inhibitor (complete; roche diagnostics,
mannheim, germany) and centrifuged, and then the supernatant
was used for the measurement of interferon (ifn)-, il-4, il-1,
il-6,  xxxg526xxx  ( xxxg526xxx ) and  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) by speciﬁc elisa. ifn- and
il-4 levels were determined using the commercial kits from
amersham biosciences uk ltd (little chalfont, bucks., uk), and
il-1, il-6 and gm-csf kits were from r&d systems (minneapolis, minn., usa). ngf kits were from promega (madison,
wisc., usa). the assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the optical density of each well was determined by using the microplate reader thermomax (molecular

effects on the levels of ifn-, il-4, il-1, il-6,
gm-csf and ngf in lesioned ears
to elucidate the mechanism by which olopatadine inhibited the development of ear swelling, we investigated
its effect on the levels of ifn-, il-4, il-1, il-6,  xxxg526xxx  and ngf in the lesioned ear. as shown in ﬁgure 3,
the levels of il-4, il-1, il-6, gm-csf and ngf in the
lesioned ear taken at 24 h after the ﬁnal challenge were
signiﬁcantly increased compared with those in the acetone-treated ear; in contrast, the ifn- level was signiﬁcantly decreased (acetone 448.8 8 56.1 pg/site, oxazolone challenge 302.4 8 12.5 pg/site).
olopatadine at 1 mg/kg/day signiﬁcantly inhibited the
increased levels of il-1 and il-6 by 24.1 and 45.5%, at
3 mg/kg/day signiﬁcantly inhibited the increased levels of
il-1, il-6 and ngf by 48.9, 66.5 and 39.3%, and at
10 mg/kg/day signiﬁcantly inhibited the increased levels
of il-4, il-1, il-6, gm-csf and ngf by 48.5, 62.4,
95.8, 74.7 and 51.2%, respectively.
on the other hand, loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine
and chlorpheniramine did not affect them. topical prednisolone signiﬁcantly inhibited the increased levels of  xxxd3054xxx , il-1, il-6, gm-csf and ngf.
the histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists tested in this
study and topical prednisolone did not affect the decrease
in ifn- levels (data not shown).
effect on the serum ige levels
the total serum ige level was signiﬁcantly increased
by repeated challenge with oxazolone (acetone 366.9 8
119.2 pg/ml, oxazolone challenge 4308.7 8 317.8 pg/ml).
the histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists in this study did
not affect the increase in total serum ige levels (data not
shown). on the other hand, topical prednisolone signiﬁcantly augmented the elevation of total serum ige level.

discussion

in the present study, we demonstrated that olopatadine appeared to exert additional biological effects besides its blockade of the histamine  xxxg1078xxx . olopatadine mitigated the cutaneous inﬂammation in a mouse

model of chronic inﬂammatory dermatitis induced by repeated challenge of oxazolone. moreover, olopatadine
clearly inhibited the increased production of il-1, il-4,
il-6, gm-csf and ngf in the lesioned ear. on the other hand, none of the four histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists tested (loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine and
chlorpheniramine) had similar effects. it is therefore conceivable that the suppressive effect of olopatadine in this
model may be due to the mechanism other than its histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonistic effect.
in an allergic reaction, various inﬂammatory cells contribute to the initial triggering and subsequent maintenance of the reaction through cell-cell interactions or the
production of soluble biological factors. th2 cells accumulate in the lesioned skin of ad, and play an important
role in the dermatitis [15, 16]. the present study demonstrated that the oxazolone-repeated challenge increased
the level of a th2 cytokine il-4 and decreased that of a
th1 cytokine ifn- in the lesioned skin. this was in accordance with the previous study by kitagaki et al. [12],
who demonstrated that th2 cytokine mrnas were abundant at lesioned skin in mice. the th2 cytokine il-4 affects a broad spectrum of different cell types and regulates
the immune response in a number of ways, thus suggesting a crucial role of il-4 in the pathogenesis of ad [17].
these observations suggest that the th2 cytokines, especially il-4, play major roles in the development of dermatitis in the present mouse model, and that the present
mouse model is likely, at least partly, to mimic the ad in
humans.
moreover, the number of mast cells increases in the
lesioned skin of ad [18]. mast cells, which participate in
the inﬂammatory cascade, serve as an abundant source
of th1 and th2 cytokines, as well as inﬂammatory mediators [11, 19]. on the other hand, il-4 is known to be
a potent activator of mast cells. the hapten-repeated challenge induced the increased number of dermal mast cells
in the lesioned skin and the development of dermal mast
cells was paralleled the development of dermatitis [20].
we have demonstrated that the oxazolone-repeated challenge induced the increased number of dermal mast cells
and that olopatadine decreased the number of dermal
mast cells in the lesioned skin [13]. these observations
suggest that mast cells play an important role in terms of
the development of cutaneous inﬂammation. in addition,
olopatadine has been shown to inhibit the expression of
il-4 mrna in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  mast cells [21], suggesting a
possible involvement of the inhibition of il-4 production
in the amelioration of the lesioned skin.

tirizine suppressed it at day 2 and 12 (ﬁg. 2c), respectively. on the other hand, fexofenadine and chlorpheniramine did not signiﬁcantly suppress the increase in ear
thickness (ﬁg. 2d, e). topical prednisolone signiﬁcantly
inhibited it from day 1 throughout the experimental period (ﬁg. 2e).

olopatadine is a selective and potent histamine h1
receptor antagonist and its clinical effect is believed to be
mediated by its antagonistic action so far. its inhibitory
effect on the development of chronic inﬂammatory dermatitis is not attributable to histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonistic effect because none of the histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists tested exerted an inhibitory effect in this
experimental model. sugimoto et al. [22] have reported
that olopatadine (3, 10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly inhibited the
antigen-induced sneeze and nasal rubbing responses and
the scratching behavior in the both wild-type mice and
 xxxg1078xxx -deﬁcient mice, but cetirizine (10 mg/kg) did
not inhibit these responses in  xxxg1078xxx -deﬁcient mice
[23]. unlike other histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists,
olopatadine potently inhibited the increased levels of
il-4, other cytokines and ngf in the lesioned ear. thus,
olopatadine has inhibitory activities against chronic inﬂammatory dermatitis, possibly resulting from its more
potently diminishing effect on elevated cytokines in the
lesioned skin than other histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists. keratinocytes are capable of producing a variety of

cytokines, and are considered to be a principal source of
cytokines in the epidermis [24, 25]. indeed, olopatadine
more potently blocked the histamine-induced cytokine
production from native human epidermal keratinocytes
than the other histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists [26].
these reports imply that olopatadine might inhibit the
production of th2-type and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
through mechanisms other than histamine  xxxg1078xxx 
antagonistic effect. further detailed analysis is necessary
on the mechanism and site of action by which olopatadine inhibits the cytokine production.
in conclusion, olopatadine appears to exert additional
biological effects besides its blockade of the histamine h1
receptor unlike other histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists.
