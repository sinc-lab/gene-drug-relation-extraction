differential and additive suppressive effects of 5-ht3 ( xxxd2834xxx )- and nk1 ( xxxd2713xxx )-receptor antagonists on cisplatin-induced vomiting and ...  to better understand the anti-emetic profile of the 5-ht3 ( xxxd2834xxx )- and the tachykinin nk1 ( xxxd2713xxx ) -receptor antagonists, either alone or in combination, we evaluated the effects of  xxxd2834xxx  and/or  xxxd2713xxx  pretreatment on cisplatin-evoked vomiting and changes in the phosphorylation of brainstem kinases such as the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2),  xxxg1837xxx /beta ( xxxg1837xxx /beta), and  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) in the least shrew. our results demonstrate that cisplatin (10mg/kg, i.p.) causes emesis in the least shrew over 40h with respective peak early- and delayed-phases occurring at 1 - 2 and 32 - 34h post-injection. during the early phase (0 - 16h post cisplatin),  xxxd2834xxx  (0.1mg/kg, s.c.) significantly protected shrews from vomiting with a near complete suppression of vomit frequency.  xxxd2834xxx  also significantly protected shrews from vomiting during the delayed phase (27 - 40h post cisplatin), but the reduction in mean vomit frequency failed to achieve significance. on the other hand,  xxxd2713xxx  (5mg/kg, i.p.) totally abolished vomiting during the delayed phase, and tended to suppress the mean vomit frequency during the acute phase. the combined treatment protected shrews almost completely from vomiting during both phases. brainstem perk1/2 levels were significantly elevated at all time-points except at 40h post-cisplatin administration. pka phosphorylation tended to be elevated throughout the delayed phase, but a significant increase only occurred at 33h. brainstem ppkcalpha/beta levels were enhanced during acute-phase with a significant elevation at 2h.  xxxd2834xxx ,  xxxd2713xxx  or their combination had no effect on elevated perk1/2 levels during acute phase, but the combination reversed  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation at 33h post-cisplatin treatment. in addition, only the combined regimen prevented the cisplatin-induced  xxxg1837xxx /beta phosphorylation observed at the acute phase. on the other hand,  xxxd2834xxx  and  xxxd2713xxx , either alone or in combination, were effective in reducing the induced elevated ppka levels during the delayed phase. these effects on cisplatin-related emetic signals downstream of 5-ht3- and nk1-receptors help us to better understand the intracellular basis of cisplatin-induced vomiting.5-ht(3) receptor; cisplatin;  xxxg1369xxx /2; emesis; nk(1) receptor; pka
