abstract
opioid and excitatory amino acid receptors contribute to morphine dependence, but there are no studies of their role in heroin dependence.
thus, mice injected with acute or chronic heroin doses in the present study were pretreated with one of the following selective antagonists: 7benzylidenenaltrexone (bntx), naltriben (ntb), nor-binaltorphimine (nor-bni; delta1, delta2, and kappa opioid receptors, respectively), mk-801, or
ly293558 (nmda and ampa excitatory amino acid receptors, respectively). naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping frequency, shown here
to be a reliable index of heroin dependence magnitude, was reduced by bntx or ntb in mice injected with both acute and chronic heroin doses.
in contrast, nor-bni did not alter jumping frequencies in mice injected with an acute heroin dose but significantly increased them in mice
receiving chronic heroin injections. continuous mk-801 or ly293558 infusion, but not injection, reduced jumping frequencies during withdrawal
from acute heroin treatment. their delivery by injection was nonetheless effective against chronic heroin dependence, suggesting mechanisms not
simply attributable to nmda or ampa blockade. these data indicate that whereas delta1, delta2, nmda, and ampa receptors enable acute and chronic
heroin dependence,  xxxg1633xxx  activity limits the dependence liability of chronic heroin. with the exception of delta1 receptors, the apparent role of
these receptors to heroin dependence is consistent with their contribution to morphine dependence, indicating that there is substantial physiological
commonality underlying dependence to both heroin and morphine. the ability of  xxxg1633xxx  blockade to differentially alter acute and chronic
dependence supports previous assertions from studies with other opioids that acute and chronic opioid dependence are, at least in part,
mechanistically distinct. elucidating the substrates contributing to heroin dependence, and identifying their similarities and differences with those
of other opioids such as morphine, may yield effective treatment strategies to the problem of heroin dependency.

drome of multiple aversive physical signs, dependence remains
a primary concern of physicians, leading them to undermedicate pain patients (breivik, 2001). for narcotic drug
abusing populations, the aversive withdrawal symptomology is
regarded as a causative factor in their continued opioid use,
engendering dangerous drug seeking behavior (jasinski, 1977).
although physical dependence is commonly associated with
chronic opioid intake, acute opioid treatment comprised of even
a single exposure can cause dependence in a wide variety of
species (smits, 1975; jasinski, 1977; mclemore et al., 1997;

180

kest et al., 2001). despite their qualitatively similar withdrawal
symptoms, there is behavioral and biochemical evidence that
acute and chronic dependence are mediated by distinct
mechanisms (nehmad et al., 1982; mclemore et al., 1997;
kest et al., 2001).
research into the mechanism of opioid dependence in
rodents has been facilitated by precipitating withdrawal by
injecting the wide-spectrum naloxone. among naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal signs in mice, frequency of uncontrollable stereotypical jumping (i.e., a hyperactivity response) is
widely considered the most sensitive and reliable index of
withdrawal intensity and is by far the most commonly used
(saelens et al., 1971; smits, 1975; el-kadi and sharif, 1994;
kest et al., 2002). for a variety of opioids, jumping frequencies
in mice during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal correlate well
with their known physical dependence liability in man (saelens
et al., 1971).
although all opioids have some dependence liability, our
current understanding of opioid dependence is based predominantly on studies using morphine (nestler et al., 1994). for
example, the recent cloning of three separate genes encoding
opioid receptors supports pharmacological studies indicating that
opioids exert their effects at mu, delta, and  xxxg1633xxx  types (knapp
et al., 1995). although morphine dependence has been shown to
be a consequence of activity at the mu type (matthes et al., 1996;
berrendero et al., 2002), delta and kappa receptors have a modulatory role.
the  xxxg1632xxx  type has been further resolved into subtypes, each
with a specific contribution to morphine dependence. for
example, blocking the delta2-subtype with naltriben (ntb) or
naltrindole 5′-isothiocyanate attenuated the jumping, body shakes
and weight loss accompanying naloxone-precipitated withdrawal
after chronic morphine treatment. in contrast, delta1-receptor antagonists, including 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (bntx), were either
without effect on any withdrawal measure or blocked the
withdrawal-induced changes in body weight only (miyamoto
et al., 1994; suzuki et al., 1997b). antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting delta2-receptors similarly attenuated naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping after acute and chronic morphine
treatment (kest et al., 1996; suzuki et al., 1997a). the exact role
of kappa opioid receptors is more equivocal. whereas mice with a
disruption in the kappa-opioid receptor gene appear to have attenuated
withdrawal signs including naloxone-precipitated withdrawal
jumping following chronic morphine administration (simonin
et al., 1998), administration of the kappa-receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine (nor-bni) increased naloxone-precipitated withdrawal weight loss in mice (suzuki et al., 1992). additionally,
administration of dynorphin a (1–13), an opioid peptide with
greater relative affinity for kappa than mu and delta receptors, immediately
prior to naloxone-precipitated withdrawal significantly suppressed the withdrawal jumping response in mice made
chronically dependent on morphine (takemori et al., 1992). the
contribution of kappa-opioid receptors to acute morphine dependence
has not been reported.
by activating n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) and alpha-amino3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4- xxxd3029xxx  (ampa) receptors, excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate also
make a critical contribution to morphine dependence. for

example, continuous infusion or repeated injection of mk-801
attenuated naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping frequencies in mice rendered dependent on morphine after acute or
chronic administration, respectively (trujillo and akil, 1991;
verma and kulkarni, 1995; mclemore et al., 1997). these data
collectively indicate a role for nmda receptors in mechanisms
contributing to both acute and chronic morphine dependence.
the contribution of ampa receptors to morphine dependence
has been much less studied, but a contribution to morphine
dependence is nonetheless indicated. chronic infusion of the
selective antagonist ly293558 attenuated jumping frequencies
in mice subject to acute morphine dependence (mclemore
et al., 1997). although the same ly293558 infusion dose was
ineffective in mice chronically treated with morphine, “knockout” mice lacking the ampa  xxxg952xxx  subunit show reduced
jumping frequencies under these conditions (vekovischeva
et al., 2001).
it has commonly thought that heroin, which is rapidly
converted to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-mam) and then morphine in vivo (inturrisi et al., 1983), would logically have a
pharmacological profile similar to that of morphine. indeed,
both opioids preferentially bind and activate mu opioid receptors
(watson et al., 1996; selley et al., 2001). however, recent data
indicate mechanistic differences between morphine and heroin
with respect to analgesia processes. for example, although
morphine analgesia is reduced in  xxxg1635xxx  deficient
cxbk mice (ikeda et al., 1999), heroin analgesia is
uncompromised (rossi et al., 1996). studies using an antisense
strategy to target different exons of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene
have also demonstrated that different splice variants mediate
morphine and heroin analgesia (rossi et al., 1995). since there
are very few studies of heroin dependence, it is unknown
whether — like analgesia — the mechanisms underlying heroin
and morphine dependence are somewhat distinct. specifically, it
is possible that opioid and excitatory amino acid receptors make
different contributions to heroin and morphine dependence.
there is currently no data that can address this possibility.
thus, the aim of the present study is twofold. first, we
sought to assess whether jumping during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from heroin is a reliable measure of dependence and to determine heroin–naloxone doses and
injection intervals yielding optimal responding. thus, we
first obtained time- and dose–response data across a range of
heroin and naloxone doses and injection intervals after both
acute and chronic heroin injection. second, we assessed the
contribution of delta and kappa opioid as well as nmda and ampa
types of excitatory amino acid receptors to heroin dependence
by using selective antagonists previously used in studies with
morphine.

maintained on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle in a climate-controlled
room with free access to food and tap water. each mouse was

181

with saline instead of heroin at the heroin–naloxone interval
eliciting the greatest jumping frequency.
2.5. dose–response studies

2.2. drugs
heroin hydrochloride and  xxxd2670xxx  (both gift of
nida), naloxone hydrochloride (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo),
the respective delta1, delta2, and  xxxg1633xxx  antagonists bntx,
naltriben, and nor-bni (all gifts of nida), and the respective
nmda and  xxxg981xxx  antagonists (5r,10s)-(−)-5-methyl10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cylcohepten-5,10-imine maleate
(mk-801; sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) and (3s,4ar,
6r,8ar)-6-[2-(1(2)h-tetrazole-5yl)ethyl] decahydroisoquinoline-3carboxylic acid (ly293558; gift of eli lily co., indianapolis, in) were delivered in a 0.9% physiological saline vehicle.
administration was by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route, either by
injection (10 ml/kg injection volume) or, for excitatory amino acid
receptor antagonists only, continuous infusion via osmotic pumps
(alzet model 2001, alza, mountain view, ca) surgically
implanted through a small dorsal midline incision in mice under
oxygen/isoflourane inhalant anesthesia. heroin and morphine
were always injected at 09:00 h with additional daily injections
during chronic treatment at 13:00 and 17:00 h. withdrawal was
always precipitated between 4 and 8 h into the light cycle (lights
on at 06:00 h).
2.3. naloxone-precipitated withdrawal
immediately after naloxone injection, subjects were placed
into individual plexiglas observation cylinders (25 × 11 cm), and
the frequency of jumps for each subject was tallied over the next
15 min. among withdrawal measures, only the jumping response — defined as the simultaneous removal of all four paws
from the horizontal surface — was consistently observed and
found to be dose-dependent in previous studies of both acute
and chronic morphine dependence (smits, 1975; el-kadi and
sharif, 1994; kest et al., 2001). thus, although symptoms such
as diarrhea, ptosis, wet-dog shakes, lacrimation were occasionally observed in the present study, they were excluded from
analysis.
2.4. time–response studies
in the acute heroin dependence protocol, mice were injected
once with heroin (50 mg/kg). to study chronic dependence,
heroin dose of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were injected t.i.d. on days
1, 2, and 3, respectively. a final heroin injection (40 mg/kg) was
made before naloxone-precipitated withdrawal on day 4. at
the completion of heroin treatment, mice were injected with
a single bolus dose of naloxone (50 mg/kg) and jumping frequencies were tallied at various hourly intervals. the heroin and
naloxone doses chosen are those previously shown to elicit
maximal jumping responses in the study of acute and chronic
morphine dependence in mice (el-kadi and sharif, 1994; kest
et al., 2002). heroin control mice were injected with saline
instead of naloxone and naloxone control mice were injected

2.5.1. heroin
the relationship between heroin dose and naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal jumping was determined for acute
and chronic dependence paradigms. for acute dependence,
mice were injected with a single heroin dose (2–50 mg/kg)
followed by naloxone (50 mg/kg). we used a heroin–naloxone
interval (2 h) determined from the above time–response studies
to yield maximal jumping responses following acute heroin
injection.
for chronic dependence studies, heroin doses of 5, 10, and
20 or 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were injected into separate groups of
mice t.i.d. on days 1, 2, and 3 respectively. on day 4, mice
received a final single 40 mg/kg heroin injection followed by a
naloxone (50 mg/kg) injection using an interval determined
from the above time–response studies to yield maximal
jumping responses following chronic heroin treatment (1 h).
heroin control mice in both acute and chronic treatment
paradigms were injected with saline instead of heroin using the
naloxone dose eliciting the greatest jumping frequency.
2.5.2. naloxone
the relationship between naloxone dose and naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal jumping was determined for acute and
chronic heroin dependence paradigms. for acute dependence,
mice were injected once with heroin (50.0 mg/kg). for the
chronic treatment condition, mice were injected with 5, 10, and
20 mg/kg of heroin on days 1, 2, and 3 respectively, followed by
a final heroin injection of 20 mg/kg on day 4. a range of
naloxone doses (0.3–50.0 mg/kg) were injected after the end of
heroin treatment using a heroin–naloxone interval shown in the
time–response studies to elicit maximal jumping frequencies
(acute: 2 h; chronic: 1 h).
naloxone control mice in both acute and chronic treatment
paradigms were injected with saline instead of naloxone using
the heroin dose eliciting the greatest jumping frequency.
2.6. opioid and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist
studies
the acute and chronic heroin dependence paradigms used in
these studies were those shown in the above time- and doseresponse studies to elicit maximal naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping frequencies.
2.6.1. acute heroin dependence
groups of mice were injected with a single bolus dose of
heroin (50 mg/kg) followed 2 h later by naloxone (50 mg/kg).
some groups were injected 30 min prior to heroin with either
bntx (0.5 mg/kg), naltriben (1 mg/kg), mk-801 (0.05 mg/kg),
or ly293558 (5 mg/kg). the bntx and naltriben doses used
are those previously reported as effective in the morphine
dependence literature (suzuki et al., 1997b). mk-801 and

182

g. klein et al. / european journal of pharmacology 586 (2008) 179–188

ly293558 doses were based on our pilot studies and were the
maximal allowable dose not causing severe motor impairment
and/or lethality. since mclemore et al. (1997) have shown that
mk-801 and ly293558 can attenuate acute morphine dependence after their continuous subcutaneous infusion, separate
groups received these drugs using delivery protocols described
in that study. specifically, pumps infusing cumulative daily
doses of 1 and 60 mg/kg containing mk-801 and ly293558,
respectively, were implanted 16 h prior to acute heroin injection
and removed 30 min prior. nor-bni (10 mg/kg) was injected 8 h
prior to heroin, corresponding to its maximal blockade of kappa
receptors (endoh et al., 1992). an antagonist control group was
injected with saline instead of an antagonist.
2.6.2. chronic heroin dependence
heroin doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were injected into
separate groups of mice t.i.d. on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. a
final 40 mg/kg heroin dose injection on day 4 was followed 1 h
later by naloxone (50 mg/kg). bntx, naltriben, mk-801, and
ly 293558 doses identical to those used for the acute heroin
study above were injected 30 min prior to each heroin injection.
we also injected the identical nor-bni dose, but since this drug
is an irreversible antagonist and a single injection provides kappa
opioid receptor blockade for up to 96 h (endoh et al., 1992), it
was injected 8 h prior to the first heroin injection on days 1 and
3 only. antagonist controls were injected with saline instead of
antagonist.
2.6.3. acute and chronic morphine dependence
previous studies report that the delta1 receptor plays no role in
morphine dependence (miyamoto et al., 1994; suzuki et al.,
1997b). however, in the above studies (sections 2.5.1 and
2.5.2), the delta1 receptor antagonist bntx nonetheless attenuated
both acute and chronic heroin npw. to confirm this apparent
dissociation between heroin and morphine dependence, we
additionally tested acute and chronic morphine dependence in
bntx treated mice using protocols virtually identical with
those used to study heroin dependence. acute morphine dependence was induced by injecting mice with a single morphine
dose (50 mg/kg). chronic morphine dependence was induced
by injecting mice t.i.d. with morphine doses of 10, 20, and
40 mg/kg on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. a final 40 mg/kg
morphine dose was injected on day 4. a single bntx dose
(0.5 mg/kg) preceded each morphine injection by 30 min. for
both paradigms, the final morphine dose was followed 3 h later
by naloxone (50 mg/kg), corresponding to the morphine–naloxone
interval yielding maximal jumping frequencies (el-kadi and
sharif, 1994; kest et al., 2001; smits, 1975). separate antagonist
control groups injected with saline instead of bntx were also
tested.
2.7. data analysis
jumping frequencies between groups within the various
studies were subject to an independent samples t-test or oneway anova. fisher's lsd test was used for post-hoc
comparisons. an alpha level of 0.05 was used throughout.

3. results
3.1. time–response studies
3.1.1. acute heroin injection
jumping frequencies after injecting the acute heroin bolus
dose was maximal when naloxone was injected 2 h later
(fig. 1a format). thus, this heroin–naloxone interval was used
to test heroin and naloxone control mice. since the mean
jumping frequencies of the two control groups were not
significantly different (heroin controls: 1.3 jumps; naloxone
controls: 2.3 jumps), they were pooled into a single control
group. relative to control values, significant naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping was observed when naloxone was
injected 1, 2, or 3 h after heroin. nonetheless, values obtained at
2 h were significantly greater than those obtained at 1 or 3 h.
jumping frequencies obtained at heroin–naloxone intervals of
0.5 and 5 h were not significantly different than those obtained
in controls.

fig. 1. time–response study of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from acute and
chronic heroin treatment. acute (top figure): mice were injected with a single
heroin dose (50 mg/kg). chronic (bottom figure): mice were injected t.i.d. for
three days with escalating heroin doses (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg on treatment days 1,
2, and 3, respectively) and a final 40 mg/kg heroin dose on day 4. withdrawal was
precipitated by injecting naloxone (50 mg/kg) at various intervals after heroin
treatment was completed. control mice were subject to the identical acute or
chronic heroin treatment protocols but received saline injections in place of either
heroin or naloxone and tested at the heroin–naloxone interval yielding maximal
frequencies. significant differences from control values (⁎ p b 0.05; ⁎⁎ p b 0.01)
are indicated.

3.1.2. chronic heroin injection
for chronic heroin treatment, maximal jumping responses
were obtained at a heroin–naloxone interval of 1 h (fig. 1b
format), and therefore both heroin and naloxone control groups
were tested at that time. again, since the mean jumping
frequencies of the two control groups were virtually identical
(heroin controls: 2.6 jumps; naloxone controls: 2.2 jumps), they
were pooled. significant jumping relative to control mice was
also observed at heroin–naloxone intervals of 2 and 3 h, but not
0.5 h. there was no significant difference between jumping
values obtained at 1, 2, and 3 h.
3.2. dose–response studies
3.2.1. acute heroin doses
there was a positive relationship between heroin dose and
naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping, with the acute
50 mg/kg heroin dose causing the greatest mean jumping
frequency (fig. 2a format). accordingly, mice in the heroin
control group were injected with the identical heroin dose (but

fig. 3. dose–response relationship between naloxone doses after heroin
treatment and jumping frequency. acute (top figure): mice were injected with
a single heroin dose (50 mg/kg). chronic (bottom figure): mice were injected
t.i.d. for three days with escalating heroin doses (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg on
treatment days 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and a final 40 mg/kg heroin dose on
day 4. naloxone doses were injected 2 and 1 h after acute and chronic heroin
treatment, respectively. naloxone control mice in both treatment paradigms
were injected with saline instead of heroin followed by an injection of the
naloxone dose eliciting the greatest jumping frequency. significant differences
from control group (⁎p b 0.05; ⁎⁎ p b 0.01) and the lower preceding dose (+) are

without subsequent naloxone). although all heroin doses
increased jumping frequency relative to heroin controls, these
differences were significant only after acute heroin injections of
10 and 50, but not 2, mg/kg. although there was no significant
difference between mice treated with the 10 and 50 mg/kg
heroin doses, their frequency values were significantly greater
(between 45% and 50%) than that obtained after 2 mg/kg
heroin.

fig. 2. dose–response relationship between acute and chronic heroin doses and
jumping frequency. acute (top figure): mice received a single injection of
various heroin doses followed 2 h later by naloxone. chronic (bottom figure):
mice were injected t.i.d. for three days with escalating heroin doses (5, 10, and
20 or 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg on treatment days 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and a
final single heroin dose (40 mg/kg) on day 4. withdrawal was precipitated by
injecting naloxone (50 mg/kg). heroin control mice in both treatment paradigms
were injected with saline instead of naloxone after injecting the heroin dose
eliciting the greatest jumping frequency. significant differences from control
group (⁎⁎p b 0.01) and all other non-control groups (+) are indicated.

3.2.2. chronic heroin doses
for chronic heroin treatment, maximal jumping responses
were obtained after treatment with the higher dosing regimen of
10, 20, and 40 mg/kg t.i.d. on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
(fig. 2b format). relative to the heroin control group, who thus
received the identical heroin dosing regimen but without
subsequent naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, both chronic
heroin dose groups displayed significantly greater jumping
frequencies. although mice treated with the greater heroin
doses jumped more (~ 30%) than those treated with the lower
chronic doses, this difference was not significant.

fig. 4. effect of opioid and excitatory amino acid receptor blockade on withdrawal jumping after acute and chronic heroin treatment. acute (left figure): mice were
injected with a single heroin dose (50 mg/kg). chronic (right figure): mice were injected t.i.d. for three days with escalating heroin doses (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg on
treatment days 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and a final 40 mg/kg heroin dose on day 4. all mice were also injected with one of the following antagonists: bntx, ntb,
nor-bni (delta1, delta2, and  xxxg1633xxx  antagonists, respectively), mk-801 and ly293558 (nmda and  xxxg981xxx  antagonists, respectively: see text for
antagonist doses and injection schedule). mk-801 and ly293558 were also delivered by continuous infusion during acute heroin treatment. withdrawal was
precipitated by naloxone (50 mg/kg) injection 2 and 1 h after completing acute and chronic heroin treatment, respectively. control mice in both treatment paradigms
were injected with saline instead of antagonist. significant differences from control group are indicated (⁎p b 0.05).

3.2.3. naloxone doses: acute heroin treatment
after an acute 50 mg/kg heroin injection, the 50 mg/kg
naloxone dose elicited the greatest mean jumping frequency
(fig. 3a format) and so naloxone control mice were injected
with this naloxone dose (without prior heroin treatment).
relative to these controls, all three naloxone doses (2, 10, and
50 mg/kg) elicited significant jumping, and there was no
significant difference between the groups.
3.2.4. naloxone doses: chronic heroin treatment
there was a clear positive relationship between naloxone
doses and jumping frequency, with the largest naloxone dose
(50 mg/kg) eliciting the greatest mean jumping frequency
(fig. 3b format) after chronic heroin treatment. thus, naloxone
control mice were injected with 50 mg/kg naloxone only.
relative to these controls, significant jumping was elicited after
naloxone doses of 3 and 50, but not 0.3, mg/kg. furthermore,
each naloxone dose significantly increased jumping frequencies
between 2- and 2.5-fold relative to the preceding lower dose.

(fig. 4a). in contrast, nor-bni increased jumping relative to
controls by ~ 70%.
3.3.3. effect of bntx on acute and chronic morphine
dependence
as illustrated in fig. 5, mice subject to our acute and chronic
morphine treatment displayed jumping responses during npw
that were similar in frequency to values obtained in mice subject
to acute and chronic heroin treatment. however, in contrast to
heroin treated mice (sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2), the delta1 opioid

the respective delta1 and delta2 opioid receptor antagonists bntx
and naltriben, but not the kappa antagonist nor-bni, significantly
reduced mean heroin–naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping frequencies by ~ 35%–50% relative to antagonist controls
(fig. 4a). although neither the respective nmda nor ampa
receptor antagonists mk-801 or ly293558 altered jumping
frequencies after their acute s.c. injection, both drugs caused
marked and significant frequency reductions of between 60%
and 80% when they were delivered by continuous infusion.

morphine doses (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg on treatment days 1, 2, and 3, respectively)
and a final 40 mg/kg morphine dose on day 4. all mice were also injected with the
delta1 opioid receptor antagonist bntx (0.5 mg/kg) 30 min prior to every morphine
injection. withdrawal was precipitated by naloxone (50 mg/kg) injection 3 h after
completing acute and chronic morphine treatment. antagonist control mice in both
treatment paradigms were injected with saline instead of bntx. there were no
significant differences between saline and bntx treated groups (p n 0.05).

receptor antagonist bntx did not attenuate jumping frequencies relative to saline-injected controls when mice were
subjected to acute or chronic morphine injection.
4. discussion
previous studies have demonstrated a positive dose–
response relationship between morphine dose and subsequent
jumping frequencies during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal
(marshall and weinstock, 1969; wiley and downs, 1979; kest
et al., 2001). on the basis of these and other studies, naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal jumping frequency is widely considered a reliable and sensitive index of morphine withdrawal
severity and, accordingly, morphine dependence. the present
study sought to determine whether there is a similar relationship
between heroin treatment and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal
jumping responses. since there has yet to be a demonstration of
a dose–response relationship between morphine and other
observable measures typical of opioid withdrawal such as
ptosis, diarrhea, wet-dog shakes, or rearing, these were not
studied here. the data show a positive dose–response relationship between either acute or chronic heroin doses and naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal jumping frequencies. although the
increased frequency between a particular dose and the one
preceding or following was not always significant, this may
simply reflect the doses chosen for study. that is, the trend in
the data indicate that eliminating some doses and/or testing
additional higher or lower doses than those presently employed
would have likely resulted in additional significant differences
between doses. in order to minimize the total number of mice
studied and lethality associated with large opioid bolus doses,
these additional doses were not tested. in contrast to the
experimental mice treated with heroin followed by naloxone,
jumping frequencies tallied in heroin control mice were minimal
(mean: 2–4 jumps/15 min). in fact, these already low mean
values are overestimates as the overwhelming majority of
subjects were non-responders, regardless of the heroin injection
protocol or dose used. collectively, these data indicate that the
responses of experimental mice were a consequence of their
heroin dependency, and that, like morphine dependence,
jumping frequency is a reliable and sensitive index of heroin
withdrawal magnitude in mice.
previous studies have also reported a positive dose–response
relationship between naloxone doses used to precipitate withdrawal after acute and chronic morphine treatment and jumping
frequency (smits 1975; el-kadi and sharif, 1994; kest et al.,
2001). here, increasing the naloxone dose also caused
significant concomitant increases in jumping frequencies
following chronic, but not acute, heroin administration. at
present we have no explanation as to why increasing naloxone
dose after an acute heroin injection did not concomitantly
increase jumping frequencies, particularly since such increases
are evident after acute morphine injection (kest et al., 2001),
and the present acute heroin protocols utilized highly similar
experimental methodologies including the range of naloxone
doses tested. although the interval between morphine and
naloxone injection of 3 h in that study was slightly longer than

185

the 2 h heroin–naloxone interval used here, this difference is
unlikely to be critical since in both studies jumping frequencies
were tallied immediately after naloxone injection and there is no
reason to suspect that differences in naloxone pharmacokinetics
between morphine and heroin treated mice that would cause
differences in naloxone bioavailability or efficacy.
the time–response data indicate that maximal naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal responding is obtained after acute and
chronic heroin treatment using a heroin–naloxone interval of 2
and 1 h, respectively. it is possible that prolonged heroin
exposure during chronic treatment caused pharmacodynamic
changes at opioid receptors themselves or recruited additional
and/or distinct adaptive changes in any of several neural
adaptations that underlie dependence subsequent to their
activation. additional studies are needed to distinguish between
these possibilities. despite their differences, the heroin–
naloxone interval yielding maximal responses after acute (2 h)
and chronic (1 h) heroin are still smaller than those demonstrated for acute (3 h) and chronic (3 h) morphine treatment
(wiley and downs, 1979; el-kadi and sharif, 1994). it seems
logical to us that ability of heroin to more rapidly cross the
blood-brain barrier and penetrate the brain relative to morphine
(oldendorf et al., 1972) may underlie this difference.
in the present study, the respective delta1 and delta2 opioid receptor
antagonists bntx and ntb significantly reduced naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal jumping frequencies relative to controls
after both acute and chronic heroin injection, suggesting that
activity at either  xxxg1632xxx  subtype enables heroin dependence.
although our finding with ntb parallels the results from
studies of acute and chronic morphine dependence, the ability of
bntx to reduce heroin withdrawal jumping frequencies does
not. that is, bntx doses identical to or even greater than that
used here are ineffective in reducing withdrawal jumping in
mice after chronic morphine treatment (suzuki et al., 1997b).
our confidence in this previous finding is greatly enhanced by
our own demonstration here that the bntx dose attenuating
heroin jumping frequencies did not similarly reduce frequencies
in morphine treated mice. furthermore, it does not seem likely
that the ability of bntx to differentially alter heroin and
morphine dependence is due to some intrinsic property of
bntx as another delta1 receptor selective antagonist, dalce, is
also ineffective in reducing jumping frequencies after chronic
morphine treatment (miyamoto et al., 1994). instead, the
prevailing evidence indicates that delta1 receptors do not contribute
to morphine dependence and, with the present data, suggest that
the  xxxg1632xxx  modulation of morphine and heroin
dependence is not identical. converging lines of evidence
indicate a close association of mu and delta binding sites in an opioid
receptor complex, and this association is thought to underlie the
ability of delta2 opioid receptors to attenuate morphine dependence
(george et al., 2000; daniels et al., 2005). we suspect that the
ability of ntb to attenuate withdrawal jumping after heroin,
which also acts primarily at the  xxxg1635xxx  (liu et al., 2003),
results from the same mechanism. however, since there are no
similar studies reporting an anatomical association or functional
interaction between mu and delta1 receptors, the basis by which delta1
receptors modulate heroin dependence is not obvious to us.

186

furthermore, any such mechanism would have to be distinct
from that mediating morphine dependence.
in contrast to  xxxg1632xxx  antagonists, the selective and
irreversible kappa-opioid receptor antagonist nor-bni was without
effect on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping frequencies after acute heroin injection. we do not believe this finding
resulted from using an insufficiently large nor-bni dose since
this dose has been shown to provide effective kappa-opioid receptor
blockade on several behavioral measures (narita et al., 1990),
including chronic morphine dependence (suzuki et al., 1992).
indeed, here, injecting the identical nor-bni dose only twice
over 4 days significantly increasing jumping frequencies in
mice injected repeatedly and chronically with heroin over
4 days. instead, we believe that kappa-opioid receptors act
exclusively to restrict withdrawal jumping after chronic but
not acute heroin treatment. that acute and chronic heroin
dependence may be mediated by distinct substrates is an
assertion previously advocated regarding acute and chronic
morphine dependence (nehmad et al., 1982; mclemore et al.,
1997; kest et al., 2001). interestingly, the identical nor-bni
dose tested here significantly increased weight loss in mice and
rats consequent to withdrawal after chronic morphine treatment
(suzuki et al., 1992). similarly, weight loss, “wet-dog” shakes,
and teeth chattering were also increased after intrathecal norbni injection in rats chronically treated with morphine (cui et
al., 2000). these findings parallel the increased jumping caused
by nor-bni in our mice chronically injected with heroin. the
mechanism by which kappa-opioid receptor blockade increases
naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms is not well understood (however, see suzuki et al., 1992). nor-bni can act as a mu
opioid receptor antagonist (endoh et al., 1992), which must be
considered when evaluating data generated by this drug.
nonetheless, it is very unlikely that any  xxxg1635xxx  blockade
of nor-bni contributed to its effects in the present study for the
following reasons. first, nor-bni injection provides only a
transient 2 to 4 h blockade of mu receptors in mice, but effectively
blocks kappa opioid receptors for up to 96 h (endoh et al., 1992).
here, nor-bni was injected 8 h prior to heroin injection and
10 h prior to naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in the acute
heroin dependence protocol, corresponding to a time when it
acts solely as a  xxxg1633xxx  antagonist. similarly, nor-bni
was injected 8 h prior to the first heroin injection on days 1 and
3, and ~ 25 h prior to precipitated withdrawal in mice subject to
chronic heroin treatment. second, the effect of nor-bni on
heroin withdrawal jumping frequencies in the present study is
inconsistent with  xxxg1635xxx  blockade. specifically, blocking mu
receptors during the injection of a  xxxg1635xxx  opioid such as
heroin should decrease or even abolish the development of
dependence and subsequent withdrawal responding. here, in
contrast, nor-bni had no effect on withdrawal jumping after
acute heroin treatment and significantly increased jumping
frequencies in mice chronically injected with heroin.
nmda receptor activity is critically important to neuronal
plasticity, resulting in adaptive changes after morphine
exposure that results in dependence (trujillo and akil, 1991;
inoue et al., 2003). indeed, mk-801 has been reported to
attenuate naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms when

delivered prior to acute and chronic morphine injections
(trujillo and akil, 1991; verma and kulkarni, 1995; mclemore
et al., 1997). here, mk-801 was always injected 30 min prior to
heroin in both the acute and chronic heroin treatment protocols,
presumably before neuronal adaptive processes have been
initiated. after an acute heroin injection, we indeed found that
nmda receptor blockade reduced jumping frequencies, but
only when mk-801 was delivered via continuous infusion
starting 16 h before heroin injection and not when it was
delivered as an acute bolus dose 30 min before. it is unlikely
that the acute mk-801 bolus dose was not sufficiently large
since the same dose was effective against chronic dependence
when injected prior to each heroin injection. furthermore, mk801 delivery by infusion was terminated 30 min prior to the
acute heroin injection, corresponding exactly with the interval
between acute mk-801 and heroin injection. thus, mk-801
delivery by infusion was no more proximal to the acute heroin
injection than was mk-801 delivery by acute bolus injection.
nonetheless, only mk-801 infusion was effective in reducing
the subsequent withdrawal jumping. these data suggest that the
ability of mk-801 to attenuate heroin dependence might not
result from the blockade of nmda receptors per se, but from
physiological and/or neuronal adaptations resulting from
prolonged mk-801 treatment. for example, chronic mk-801
administration or nmda receptor blockade can reduce the
density of the glutamate binding site within the nmda receptor
(manallack et al., 1989; beart and lodge, 1990), which would
presumably down-regulate nmda receptor activity and the
consequent biochemical cascade that underlies dependence, and
alter gabaa and dopamine d2 receptors that contribute to
opioid dependence (micheletti et al., 1992; lannes et al., 1995;
zarrindast et al., 2002). this supposition is also consistent with
the finding that mice injected daily with mk-801 followed by
saline for 8 consecutive days show attenuated withdrawal
jumping and weight loss in response to an acute morphine
injection on day 9 (koyuncuoglu et al., 1999). such an adaptive
process may similarly underlie the efficacy with which repeated
and chronic acute mk-801 bolus doses injected prior to each
heroin injection were effective against chronic heroin
dependence.
like nmda receptors, ampa receptors mediate long-term
central nervous system changes (bettler and mulle, 1995). not
surprisingly then, these receptors contribute to morphine
dependence (mclemore et al., 1997; vandergriff and rasmussen,
1999) and, as demonstrated here, they apparently do so with
respect to heroin dependence as well. we observed that
ly293558 delivery by continuous infusion — but not acute
bolus dose injection — prior to acute heroin injection reduced
naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping, and injecting a bolus
dose of ly293558 t.i.d. over 4 days also attenuated jumping
frequencies in the chronic heroin treatment protocol. the finding
that continuous ly293558 infusion reduces acute heroin
dependence parallels the finding that it attenuates withdrawal
jumping under identical acute morphine dosing and delivery
protocols (mclemore et al., 1997). although pharmacological,
electrophysiological, and molecular cloning studies have demonstrated that excitatory amino acid receptors are functionally and

g. klein et al. / european journal of pharmacology 586 (2008) 179–188

constitutively distinct (watkins and collingridge, 1994; bettler
and mulle, 1995), the effect of ly293558 on heroin dependence
was identical to our present finding with mk-801. accordingly,
we suggest that, like mk-801, it is possible that only prolonged
ly293558 treatment will reduce withdrawal jumping. unlike for
chronic mk-801 treatment and nmda receptor blockade,
however, we are not aware of any studies reporting that chronic
ly293558 administration or  xxxg981xxx  blockade causes
adaptive changes that might obviously impact heroin or opioid
dependence. it is important to note that ampa receptors have a
highly overlapping anatomical distribution with nmda receptors
and are thought to assist in their activation by providing the
postsynaptic depolarization necessary to remove the voltagesensitive mg2+ blockade of nmda receptors (bliss and
collingridge, 1993; patel and mcculloch, 1995). since mk801 and ly293558 were effective only under the identical
specific delivery protocols, we can not rule out the possibility that
blockade of ampa receptors here by ly293558 reduced heroin
dependence only indirectly, via an  xxxg981xxx -mediated
reduction in nmda receptor activity. mechanism notwithstanding, the present data indicate that activation of the excitatory
amino acid receptors nmda or ampa during acute and chronic
heroin treatment enables heroin dependence.
finally, it should be noted that the antagonist injection
protocols used here make it almost certain that these drugs were
pharmacologically active during heroin injection and subsequent
naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. thus, it is possible that the
opioid and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists altered
jumping frequencies by altering the mechanisms underlying the
induction of heroin dependence, the expression of withdrawal per
se, or both. clearly needed are studies of opioid dependence that
discern between these alternative possibilities, which will likely
have practical implications in addressing the utility of these drugs
in treating populations already opioid-addicted.
