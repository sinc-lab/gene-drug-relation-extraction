abstract: in vivo microdialysis in conscious rats was used to examine the effect of clozapine on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) efflux in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus and dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex.
both systemic and local administration of clozapine (systemic,10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.; local, 100 mm) increased 5-ht
efflux in the dorsal raphe. however, in the prefrontal cortex, dialysate 5-ht increased when clozapine (100 mm) was
administered through the probe, while no effect was observed when it was administered systemically. by pretreatment
with the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist p-mppi (3 mg/kg, i.p.), systemic treatment of clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.)
significantly increased 5-ht efflux in the prefrontal cortex. this result suggests that the ability of clozapine to enhance
the extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the dorsal raphe attenuates this drug’s effect in the frontal cortex, probably
through the stimulation of 5-ht1a somatodendritic autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe. we also found that pretreatment
with p-mppi (3 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated by 45% the rise in cortical dopamine levels induced by clozapine (10 mg/kg,
i.p.). these findings imply that the reduction in serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe nucleus induced by clozapine
could lead to an increase in dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex.
key words:  xxxg1108xxx , clozapine, microdialysis, 5-ht, dopamine.
résumé : on a utilisé la microdialyse in vivo chez des rats éveillés pour examiner l’effet de la clozapine sur l’efflux
de sérotonine (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) dans le cortex préfrontal et le noyau du raphé dorsal, et sur l’efflux de dopamine dans le cortex préfrontal. des administrations systémique et locale de clozapine (systémique, 10 et 20 mg/kg,
i.p.; locale, 100 mm) ont augmenté l’efflux de 5-ht dans le raphé dorsal. toutefois, dans le cortex préfrontal, la teneur
du dialysat en 5-ht a augmenté lorsque la clozapine (100 mm) a été administrée par la sonde, alors qu’aucun effet n’a
été observé lorsqu’elle a été administrée par voie systémique. après un prétraitement avec l’antagoniste sélectif du
récepteur de 5-ht1a, p-mppi (3 mg/kg, i.p.), le traitement systémique de la clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) a augmenté
significativement l’efflux de 5-ht dans le cortex préfrontal, donnant à penser que la capacité de la clozapine à stimuler
les concentrations extracellulaires de 5-ht dans le raphé dorsal atténue l’effet de ce médicament dans le cortex frontal,
probablement par la stimulation des autorécepteurs somatodendritiques de la 5-ht1a dans le raphé dorsal. nous avons
aussi constaté que le prétraitement par p-mppi (3 mg/kg, i.p.) a atténué de 45 % l’augmentation des taux de dopamine
corticale induite par la clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). ces résultats ont laissé entendre que la réduction par la clozapine
des influx sérotoninergiques en provenance du noyau du raphé dorsal pourrait conduire à une augmentation de la
libération de dopamine dans le cortex préfrontal.

schizophrenia, and is effective in many patients who are refractory to typical antipsychotics. in addition, clozapine does
not induce the extrapyramidal side effects commonly caused
by typical agents. due to these properties, clozapine was
termed atypical and represents the prototype drug of this
class (ashby and wang 1996; duncan et al. 1999).
clozapine binds to a diverse number of neurotransmitter
receptors, but it is unclear whether actions at specific serotonin (5-ht), dopamine, or adrenergic receptors, alone or in
combination, account for its clinical efficacy (ashby and
wang 1996; duncan et al. 1999). it has been suggested that
the atypical profiles of antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine
are due to their preference for 5-ht2a over dopamine type-2
(d2) receptors (meltzer and nash 1991; watanabe and
hagino 1999). however, the clinical efficacy of clozapine

may not be solely related to the ability of this agent to antagonize 5-ht2a and d2 receptors (ichikawa and meltzer
1999).
in contrast, the superior clinical efficacy of clozapine may
be related to its ability to selectively increase the release of
dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) (hertel et al. 1996;
kuroki et al. 1999; millan et al. 1998; moghaddam and
bunney 1990; volonte et al. 1997; youngren et al. 1999).
this enhancement of cortical dopamine release may underlie
its efficacy against negative symptoms because the negative
symptomatology in schizophrenia has been hypothesized to
be associated with a functional impairment of mesocortical
dopaminergic transmission (knable and weinberger 1997).
however, the mechanism by which clozapine preferentially
increases extracellular dopamine in the pfc remains elusive.
serotonergic mechanisms are of particular relevance in
view of both their modulation of dopaminergic transmission
and their key role in the control of mood, cognition, and motor behavior (millan 2000). recently, extensive evidence has
been reported that the importance of the 5-ht1a-receptor
agonistic action of clozapine may be crucial for its clinical
uniqueness (ashby and wang 1996; ichikawa and meltzer
1999; ichikawa et al. 2001; millan 2000; newman-tancredi
et al. 1996; rollema et al. 1997). thus, it is important to determine precisely the effects of clozapine administration on
5-ht efflux in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn) and the pfc.
given the purported role of 5-ht in the mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic clozapine, in the present study,
we examined clozapine-induced effects on brain 5-ht systems. the effects of clozapine administered locally and systemically on extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in both the
medial pfc and the drn were studied by means of microdialysis. to clarify the role of  xxxg1108xxx  activation on
clozapine’s effects on 5-ht and dopamine release, the effects of the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist 4-(2¢methoxyphenyl)-1-{2¢-[n-(2 ¢¢-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]ethyl} piperazine (p-mppi) (allen et al. 1997; kung et al.
1994; thielen et al. 1996) on cortical dopamine and 5-ht
efflux were examined.

subjects
male wistar rats weighing 300–350 g were used throughout the study. the animals were housed with free access to
water and food under a 12 h light : 12 h dark cycle (lights on
at 0800) in a temperature-controlled environment.
surgery and microdialysis
in vivo microdialysis experiments were performed as
previouly described (hagino and moroji 1994; watanabe
and hagino 1999). rats were stereotaxically implanted under anesthesia (sodium pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) with
microdialysis probes in either the prc or drn 24 h before

the experiment. all dialysis probe placements were verified
histologically.
the coordinates with respect to the bregma and dura surface for the pfc were as follows: anterior, 4.2 mm; lateral,
0.5 mm; ventral, 5.0 mm. the coordinates for the drn (implanted with a lateral angle of 10°) were as follows: posterior, 6.0 mm; lateral, 1.2 mm; ventral 8.0 mm (according to
the atlas of pellegrino and cushman 1967). the dialyzing
membrane length was 4 mm for the pfc and 1 mm for the
drn.
the perfusion experiments were performed on unrestrained, freely moving animals. ringer’s solution (145 mm
nacl, 3 mm kcl, 1.26 mm cacl2, and 1 mm mgcl2
(ph 6.5)) was perfused at a constant flow rate of 2 ml/min.
perfusates were directly injected into the high-performance
liquid chromatography system every 20 min using an
autoinjector (as-10; eicom corporation, kyoto, japan). the
5-ht and dopamine in the dialysate were separated using a
reverse-phase ods column (eicompack ca-5ods, eicom
corporation) and detected with a graphite electrode (ecd100, eicom corporation). the mobile phase consisted of
0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 6.0); for 5-ht the buffer contained sodium octanesulfonate (250 mg/l), edta
(50 mg/l), and 21% methanol v/v; for dopamine the buffer
contained sodium octanesulfonate (500 mg/l), edta
(50 mg/l), and 20% methanol v/v.
the detection limit of the assay for 5-ht and dopamine
was -1 fmol/sample with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2. in vitro probe recoveries for 5-ht and dopamine were 9 and
10%, respectively, when perfusing at a flow rate of 2 ml/min.

drugs
clozapine (sandoz, basel, switzerland) was dissolved in
0.1 n hcl and the ph was adjusted to 6.0 with 0.1 n naoh.
p-mppi–hcl (research biochemicals international, natick,
mass.) was dissolved in deionized water. clozapine in a volume of 1.0 ml/kg or p-mppi in a volume of 2.5 ml/kg
were administered i.p. in the interaction studies, p-mppi or
vehicle was administered 20 min prior to clozapine or vehicle. clozapine was also dissolved in perfusion solution and
administered locally into the pfc and drn via the dialysis
membrane for 60 min at concentration of 100 mm. the concentration of clozapine (100 mm) is comparable to that used
by previous investigators to examine the effect of local
clozapine infusion on dopamine efflux (pehek and
yamamoto 1994).
tetrodotoxin (ttx) (sigma, st. louis, mo.) was dissolved in the perfusion solution. the 1 mm ttx perfusion
began 60 min before clozapine application.
analysis of data
all data were calculated as percent changes from dialysate
basal concentrations, with 100% defined as the average of
the final three preinjection values. the effects of the drugs
on dialysate 5-ht and dopamine were calculated using the
area under the curve of the response during the 180-min interval after treatment. thereafter, statistical comparisons were
performed among the groups on the area-under-the-curve
data by using analysis of variance (anova) followed by a
post-hoc scheffé’s test. a probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant in this study.

basal extracellular 5-ht and dopamine levels in the
pfc and drn
no significant difference was found in the basal dialysate
concentrations of 5-ht and dopamine between the different
drug treatment groups and the appropriate control group.
mean baseline values of 5-ht in dialysates from the pfc
and drn were 5.71 ± 0.30 fmol per 20 min (n = 49) and
3.80 ± 0.24 fmol per 20 min (n = 26), respectively. the
mean baseline value of dopamine in dialysate from the pfc
was 6.43 ± 0.52 fmol per 20 min (n = 19).

effects of systemic administration of clozapine on
extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the pfc and
drn
as shown in fig. 1a, when clozapine was administered
i.p., neither treatment nor dose significantly affected
extracellular 5-ht in the pfc. in contrast to the effects of
systemic clozapine in the pfc, systemically administered
clozapine (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased the extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the drn
(f2,14 = 14.48, p < 0.001) (fig. 1b).
effects of local administration of clozapine on
extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the pfc and
drn
local administration of clozapine (100 mm, perfused for
60 min) significantly increased extracellular concentrations
of 5-ht in the pfc (f1,8 = 48.57, p < 0.001) (fig. 2a). local administration of clozapine also significantly increased
the extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the drn (f1,7 =
439.06, p < 0.001) (fig. 2b). the effects of locally applied
clozapine on 5-ht were statistically comparable in the pfc
and drn.
effects of clozapine given systemically on extracellular
5-ht in the pfc in animals pretreated with p-mppi
systemic administration of p-mppi alone (3 mg/kg, i.p.)
did not modify extracellular concentrations of 5-ht
(fig. 3b). systemic administration of clozapine (10 mg/kg),
which by itself did not change cortical 5-ht, increased
extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the pfc of rats
pretreated with p-mppi (20 min before clozapine) (f1,11 =
20.99, p < 0.001) (fig. 3a).

effect of ttx perfusion on the increases in
extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the pfc and
drn induced by locally administered clozapine
after the perfusion of ttx (1 mm) alone via the dialysis
probe for 60 min, the levels of extracellular 5-ht decreased
to 25 and 20% of basal levels in the pfc and drn, respectively (figs. 4a and 4b). we also found that the absence of
ca2+ ions in the perfusion medium decreased 5-ht efflux in
the pfc and drn (data not shown). these observations
confirmed that the present dialysis method detected
neurogenic 5-ht efflux in the pfc and drn. the
facilitatory effect of 100 mm clozapine on 5-ht output was
markedly reduced in the presence of ttx in the pfc
(f3,14 = 30.58, p < 0.001) (fig. 4a). similarly, infusion of
ttx completely prevented the increase of 5-ht in the drn

induced by locally administered clozapine (f3,12 = 124.49,
p < 0.001) (fig. 4b).
effects of p-mppi on clozapine-induced changes in
extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the pfc
systemic administration of clozapine (10 mg/kg) alone
markedly increased the extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the pfc. pretreatment with p-mppi (3 mg/kg,
20 min before clozapine), which by itself did not affect dopamine efflux, significantly attenuated the increases in the
cortical dopamine efflux produced by clozapine by 45%
(f3,15 = 48.20, p < 0.001) (fig. 5). however, p-mppi did not
completely reverse the effect of clozapine on the dopamine
efflux. thus, there was a partial reversal of the clozapineinduced elevation of dopamine output by p-mppi.

verse microdialysis (hertel et al. 2001; pehek and
yamamoto 1994). it should be noted that although the concentrations of drug infused through the microdialysis probe
are in the high micromolar range, this does not reflect the
quantities of drug reaching the brain tissue. the quantity infused in 60 min at a rate of 2 ml/min for a concentration of
100 mm is equal to the molarity × 120 ml = 12 nmoles.
however, this still does not reflect the amount reaching the
tissue. in vitro recoveries of dopamine and 5-ht are 9–10%
using the present microdialysis probes. nomikos et al.
(1990) have shown that the in vitro recoveries of several
dopamine-uptake blockers were inversely related to their
molecular weights. these weights ranged from 135 to 450,
with recoveries from 8.6 to 2.0%. because the molecular
weight of clozapine is 327, it is likely that the concentration
of clozapine crossing the dialysis membrane and into the
brain in the present study was much lower than the drug
concentration (100 mm) in the perfusion medium. however,
the precise concentration of the administered drug in the surrounding interstitial space is usually unknown (benveniste
1989). on the other hand, michel and trudeau (2000) noted
that the concentration of clozapine in the brains of patients

study will be within the range of clinically relevant concentrations.
infusion of minor quantities of ttx during a release experiment could indicate whether neuronal activity was involved in drug-induced processes (westerink et al. 1987). in
the present study, perfusion of 1 mm ttx markedly decreased extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the drn and
pfc, suggesting that somatodendritic and terminal release of
5-ht was dependent on the nerve impulses of serotonergic
neurons. these findings are in line with those of previous
studies indicating that somatodendritic 5-ht release is dependent upon voltage-activated sodium channels possibly located on the somatodendritic membranes (bosker et al.
1994; matos et al. 1996). furthermore, we found that the increase in 5-ht output induced by local perfusion of
clozapine was prevented by ttx infusion in the cortex and
dorsal raphe, indicating that facilitation of 5-ht output that
is dependent on nerve impulse activity played a crucial role
in the local administration of clozapine-induced augmentation of 5-ht output in those areas.
the clozapine-induced increase in 5-ht levels is not
likely to arise from 5-ht uptake inhibition, because
clozapine has low affinity for the 5-ht uptake site (ki =
5450 nm) (leysen et al. 1993). the release of 5-ht in the

pfc has been shown to be regulated via both 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  autoreceptors and a2-adrenergic heteroreceptors, presumably located on 5-ht nerve terminals (brazell et al.
1985; gobert et al. 1998; middlemiss 1985; trendelenburg
et al. 1994).
hertel et al. (1998) reported that local cortical application
of both risperidone and the selective a2 adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan, increased extracellular levels of 5-ht in the
pfc and suggested that risperidone’s a2 adrenoceptor antagonistic action could augment 5-ht output in the pfc. since
clozapine also possesses high affinity for a2 adrenoceptors
(ki = 33 nm) (duncan et al. 1999), it is conceivable that the
observed increase in 5-ht output in the pfc stimulated by
local perfusion of clozapine may be related to the antagonism of a2 adrenoceptors located on serotonergic nerve terminals in the frontal cortex. however, arguing against a role
of a2-adrenoceptor blockade, gobert et al. (1998) noted that
blockade of a2-adrenergic heteroreceptors did not increase
5-ht release in the pfc, indicating that their control of
5-ht release is usually not tonic. on the other hand,
clozapine has low affinity for 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  receptors (ki =
1700–3280 nm) (duncan et al. 1999; schotte et al. 1996),
suggesting that a facilitatory effect of local perfusion of
clozapine on 5-ht levels in the pfc cannot be mediated
through antagonism of 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  autoreceptors.
recently, hertel et al. (2001) reported that the atypical
antipsychotic risperidone enhanced 5-ht efflux in the drn
via blockade of 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  receptors. however,
clozapine is a poor ligand for the 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  receptors
(duncan et al. 1999; schotte et al. 1996), which argues
against antagonism of 5-ht1b/ xxxg1110xxx  receptors as the
mechanism responsible for clozapine’s stimulatory effect on
5-ht output in the drn. it is also unlikely that the observed
increase in 5-ht output in the drn stimulated by clozapine
is related to antagonism of a2 adrenoceptors, because hertel
et al. (1998) reported that local raphe administration of the
a2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan did not increase 5-ht
in the drn. thus, the mechanism responsible for the enhancing the effects of clozapine on 5-ht output in the dorsal
raphe in the present study is currently unknown.
one possible reason underlying the increase in 5-ht
efflux in both the pfc and drn stimulated by clozapine
might be interference with the activity of gabaergic interneurons, which may exert inhibitory control of 5-ht output.
there is evidence that clozapine could cause a reduction in
gabaergic transmission (michel and trudeau 2000). thus,
it is possible that clozapine disinhibits 5-ht efflux by
inhibting gabaergic activity, although direct evidence for
this has yet to be provided.
in the present study, systemic administration of clozapine
alone did not change dialysate 5-ht levels in the pfc.
these findings are in agreement with those of previous studies indicating that systemically administered clozapine had
no significant effect on extracellular 5-ht levels in the pfc
(ichikawa et al. 1998; millan et al. 1998). however, we
found that this treatment significantly increased 5-ht output
in the frontal cortex of rats that had received the selective
5-ht1a antagonist p-mppi (3 mg/kg), a condition which by
itself did not change the cortical 5-ht concentration. a
plausible explanation for these findings is that the enhancing
effect of systemically administered clozapine on extra-

cellular 5-ht in the frontal cortex is attenuated by its simultaneous ability to activate somatodendritic 5-ht1a receptors
through an increase in 5-ht in the drn.
somewhat at variance with our present finding, millan et
al. (1998) reported that the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way 100,635 (0.16 mg/kg) did not modify the influence of clozapine (2.5 mg/kg) upon pfc levels of 5-ht.
previous investigators have provided data indicating that
both way100,635 and its close structural analog p-mppi
are highly selective 5-ht1a antagonists. way 100,635 and
p-mppi display high affinities for 5-ht1a receptors (ki =
4.5 and 1 nm, respectively), but only low to moderate affinities for a1-adrenergic, a2-adrenergic, b-adrenergic, d2, and
5-ht2 receptors, and have demonstrated antagonositic-like
activity at both somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors and
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors (allen et al. 1997; fletcher et
al. 1996; kung et al. 1994; thielen et al. 1996). thus, the
reason for the discrepancy between the results presented
here and the previous results of millan et al. (1998) remains
to be clarified.
the mechanism of the clozapine-induced inhibition of
5-ht cell firing
in the present study, both systemic and local raphe administration of clozapine increased the extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in the drn, a major origin for serotonergic
innervation of the pfc. the cell bodies and dendrites of
serotonergic neurons have a very high density of 5-ht1a
autoreceptors that exert a negative control on cell firing and
on release from nerve terminals (sharp et al. 1989; sprouse
and aghajanian 1987).
thus, the enhacing effects of clozapine on 5-ht concentrations in the drn in the present study indicate that the
clozapine-induced inhibition of 5-ht cell firing in the drn
in previous studies (gallager and aghajanian 1976; millan
et al. 1998; lejeune et al. 1994; sprouse et al. 1999) was, at
least partly, secondary to an increased availability of
extracellular 5-ht in the drn, which may result in an activation of 5-ht1a somatodendritic autoreceptors.
on the other hand, lejeune et al. (1994) concluded that
the decrease in 5-ht neurotransmission caused by clozapine
was mediated through a1-adrenoceptor blockade rather than
by 5-ht1a autoreceptor agonism. this interpretation gained
support from receptor-binding studies in vitro, which demonstrated that clozapine showed more pronounced affinity at
a1-adrenoceptors (k i = 24 nm) than at 5-ht 1a receptors
(ki = 145 nm) (leysen et al. 1993). such a mechanism has
been proposed by other studies that reported similar findings: dose-dependent inhibition of serotonin neuronal firing
by clozapine and reversal of its effect by agents that increased noradrenergic tone (gallager and aghajanian 1976;
sprouse et al. 1999).
thus, the present findings suggest the possibility that the
inhibitory effect of clozapine on 5-ht cell firing, in addition
to interference with the regulation of 5-ht cell firing via
blockade of a1 adrenoceptors, may also be mediated through
agonism of 5-ht1a receptors. clozapine displays moderate
affinity at 5-ht1a receptors and partial agonism at recombinant human 5-ht1a receptors (newman-tancredi et al.
1996). thus, partial 5-ht1a agonist activity of clozapine and
increased concentrations of 5-ht induced by clozapine in

the drn might have a synergistic inhibitory effect on 5-ht
neurons. therefore, it is conceivable that the inhibition of
5-ht cell firing by clozapine may result from a combination
of a1 antagonism and 5-ht1a agonism.

influence of clozapine on dopamine levels
in line with previous findings (ichikawa et al. 2001;
rollema et al. 1997, 2000), we found that clozapine produced a marked increase in dopamine efflux in the pfc.
this increase was largely mediated via activation of 5-ht1a
receptors, since pretreatment with the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist p-mppi was found to markedly attenuate
the clozapine-induced rise in cortical dopamine levels. however, at variance with the present findings and those of previous studies (ichikawa et al. 2001; rollema et al. 1997,
2000), millan et al. (1998) reported that the selective 5-ht1a
antagonist way 100,635 did not modify the increase in cortical dopamine output induced by clozapine. the reason for
this discrepancy is presently unknown.
several lines of evidence suggest that the 5-ht system exerts an inhibitory action on mesocortical dopaminergic pathways (arborelius et al. 1993; lejeune et al. 1997; millan
2000; millan et al. 2000; prisco et al. 1994). dopaminergic
neurons in the parabrachial subdivisions of the ventral
tegmental area (vta) that project primarily to the pfc are
subject to more pronounced serotonergic control than their
paranigral counterparts projecting to limbic structures
(arborelius et al. 1993). the selective  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin inhibits the firing
rate of drn neurons (lejeune et al. 1997) and decreases 5ht output in the pfc (gobert et al. 1998), while this drug
stimulates vta neuron firing (lejeune et al. 1997) and increases dialysate levels of dopamine in the pfc (gobert et
al. 1998). these findings imply that activation of 5-ht1a
autoreceptors, which suppress serotonergic transmission,
should disinhibit mesocortical dopaminergic pathways.
a combination of a1 antagonism and 5-ht1a agonism of
clozapine in the dorsal raphe, by suppressing the activity of
raphe 5-ht neurons, may decrease the 5-ht-containing input to the dopaminergic neurons. this may lead to an increase in dopamine release in the pfc, to which the
parabrachial subdivisions of the vta project dopamine neurons. indeed, clozapine potently stimulates the firing rate
and the burst firing of dopamine neurons projecting to the
pfc (melis et al. 1999).
however, although clozapine’s agonistic activity at 5-ht1a
receptors and its effects on dopamine efflux in the pfc are
clear, its precise site of action, whether on cell-body autoreceptors or on postsynaptic receptors in the forebrain, remains to be determined.
in the present study, however, p-mppi did not completely
abolish the elevation in dopamine levels provoked by
clozapine. the remaining 5-ht1a-independent increase in
cortical dopamine release could result from an interaction
with other neurotransmitter receptors, such as the blockade
of 5-ht2c receptors (rollema et al. 2000), the simultaneous
blockade of 5-ht2a and d2 receptors (andersson et al.
1995; kuroki et al. 1999), d2 and a2-adrenoceptor blockade
(hertel et al. 1999), or the combination of 5-ht2a antagonist
and partial 5-ht1a agonist activity (ichikawa et al. 2001).

therapeutic significance
the finding that clozapine may act as a  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist in vivo may further contribute to its efficacy as an
antipsychotic with activity against negative symptoms. these
findings underscore the importance of 5-ht1a-receptormediated modulation of cortical dopaminergic acivity, an action of potential importance to the therapeutic profile of
clozapine. indeed, clinical findings suggest that the 5-ht1a
receptor partial agonist buspirone improves the symptoms of
schizophrenic patients (goff et al. 1991).
schizophrenia may indeed be associated with impaired
dopaminergic functioning in the pfc (okubo et al. 1997).
enhanced dopamine output in the pfc induced by the stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors by clozapine may have therapeutic value for the treatment of the negative symptoms and
cognitive impairment of schizophrenia.
