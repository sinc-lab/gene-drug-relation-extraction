mutations in the  xxxg1414xxx  gene on human chromosome 4q31.21 result in  xxxd1771xxx -responsive methylmalonic
aciduria ( xxxg1414xxx  complementation group) due to deficiency in the synthesis of adenosylcobalamin. genomic dna
from 37  xxxg1414xxx  patients, diagnosed on the basis of cellular adenosylcobalamin synthesis, methylmalonyl–
 xxxd1739xxx  (coa) mutase function, and complementation analysis, was analyzed for deleterious mutations in
the  xxxg1414xxx  gene by dna sequencing of exons and flanking sequences. a total of 18 novel mutations were
identified, bringing the total number of mutations identified in 37  xxxg1414xxx  patients to 22. a total of 13 mutations
result in premature stop codons; three are splice site defects; and six are missense mutations that occur at highly
conserved residues. eight of these mutations were common to two or more individuals. one mutation,
c.433c4t (r145x), represents 43% of pathogenic alleles and a common haplotype was identified. restriction
endonuclease or heteroduplex diagnostic tests were designed to confirm mutations. none of the sequence
changes identified in  xxxg1414xxx  patients were found in 100 alleles from unrelated control individuals. hum mutat

introduction

methylmalonic acidemia is a rare human disorder
caused by a decreased activity of mitochondrial methylmalonyl– xxxd1739xxx  (coa) mutase (mcm), one of two
mammalian enzymes that utilize  xxxd1771xxx  (cobalamin,
cbl) derivatives. mcm catalyzes the adenosylcobalamin
(adocbl)-dependent rearrangement of l-methylmalonyl-coa to succinyl-coa. this is an important intermediary step in the catabolism of branched chain amino
acids and odd chain  xxxd2154xxx  via the tricarboxylic acid
cycle. a defect in either mcm or the gene products
involved in the conversion of exogenous cbl to adocbl
leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in the
blood and urine of affected individuals.
the  xxxg1414xxx  complementation class of inborn errors of
cobalamin metabolism (mim# 251100) is one of three
known disorders that affect adocbl synthesis without
also affecting the synthesis of methylcobalamin (mecbl),
a second cbl derivative required for activity of the
cytoplasmic enzyme  xxxg1479xxx  [rosenblatt
and fenton, 2001]. the gene responsible for  xxxg1414xxx  has
been identified through the examination of prokaryotic
gene arrangements and is called  xxxg1414xxx  (mim#
r2004 wiley-liss, inc.

607481) [dobson et al., 2002]. the identification of
four mutations in five  xxxg1414xxx  patients confirmed the gene
assignment. the precise role of the  xxxg1414xxx  gene product
is not known, but previous studies have suggested its
involvement in either mitochondrial cbl transport or
reduction of cobalamin [fenton and rosenberg, 1978;
dobson et al., 2002]. more recently, a role for  xxxg1414xxx  in
the maintenance of mcm dimer stabilization and cbl
cofactor protection has been suggested [korotkova and
lidstrom, 2004].
individuals affected with  xxxg1414xxx  typically present with
severe disease in infancy or early childhood and are
prone to potentially life threatening acidotic crises
[rosenblatt and fenton, 2001]. cultured fibroblasts

lerner-ellis et al.

from  xxxg1414xxx  patients have characteristic biochemical
features, including: 1) reduced synthesis of adocbl from
exogenous cyanocobalamin (cncbl) with normal levels
of methylcobalamin (mecbl); 2) reduced ability to
incorporate propionate into cellular macromolecules, an
indirect measure of adocbl-dependent mcm activity;
and 3) the ability to complement all other inborn errors
of cobalamin metabolism in cell culture [gravel et al.,
1975; fenton and rosenberg, 1978; willard et al., 1978;
watkins et al., 2000].
a total of 37  xxxg1414xxx  patients were identified on the basis
of adocbl synthesis, mcm function and complementation analysis. our aim was to identify novel mutations in
the  xxxg1414xxx  gene in these patients by sequencing the
exons and flanking regions.
materials and methods
patients
sequencing of the  xxxg1414xxx  gene (nm_172250.1) was carried
out on a panel of 37  xxxg1414xxx  patients and 50 anonymous controls.
this includes five patients previously studied by dobson et al.

table 1.

[2002]. patient cell line numbers are listed in table 1, along with
the sex, race, and age of onset of these individuals, except for five
patients for whom complete clinical information was not available.
consanguinity was reported in two individuals.
fibroblast studies
diagnosis of  xxxg1414xxx  was based on assessment of cellular adocbl
synthesis and mcm function, and was confirmed by complementation analysis [watkins et al., 2000]. mcm function in
intact fibroblasts was assessed by measuring incorporation of
[14c]propionate into acid-precipitable material. cell lines were
plated into 35-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 4  105
cells per dish and incubated for 18 hr in puck’s f medium
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (fbs) and 100 mmol/l
[14c]propionate (new england nuclear, www.perkinelmer.com),
diluted with unlabeled propionate to give a final specific activity of
10 mci/mmol. the assay was performed in the presence and
absence of 3.75 mmol/l  xxxd2300xxx  (ohcbl). macromolecules were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. the
precipitated material was dissolved in 0.2 n sodium hydroxide
and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.
all patient fibroblasts had decreased incorporation of label from
[14c]propionate into cellular macromolecules compared to control
fibroblasts (table 2).

cobalamin distributions were determined by growing cells in 25
pg/ml [57co]cncbl (amersham, www5.amershambiosciences.com
or mp biomedicals, www.mpbio.com) for 4 days, followed by
extraction of labeled cobalamins in darkness in  xxxd102xxx  at
851c. intracellular cobalamins were separated by high performance
liquid chromatography (hplc) as previously described [rosenblatt
et al., 1984]. all patient fibroblast lines had decreased synthesis of
adocbl from [57co]cncbl compared to controls (table 2).
dna sequencing
dna was extracted from patient and control fibroblasts using
the qiagen genomic dna extraction kit for cultured cells.
 xxxg1414xxx  exons 1–3 and flanking sequences were amplified by pcr
using primers listed in table 3 (primers were designed using primer
3.0 software available online at www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/
primer/primer3_www.cgi) and exons 4–7 were amplified using
primers described by dobson et al. [2002]. pcr products were
purified with montage pcr96 filter plates (millipore, www.
millipore.com). purified pcr products were used for 10 ml

511

sequencing reactions made up of 2 ml pcr product, 1 ml of
bigdye terminator cycle sequencing version 2.0 or version 3.0
(applied biosystems, www.appliedbiosystems.com), 1.5 ml of 5 
buffer, 5 ml h2o, and 0.5 ml (1 mm final) of sense or anti-sense
primer. amplicons were sequenced in both forward and reverse
directions. products were analyzed on an abi3700 automated
dna sequencer (applied biosystems). gel files were processed
using sequence analysis software (pe applied biosystems) and
were assembled and analyzed using the phred/phrap/consed
system [ewing et al., 1998; gordon et al., 1998]. dna mutation
numbering is based on cdna sequence with +1 corresponding to
the a of the atg translation initiation codon.
restriction endonuclease and heteroduplex analysis
 xxxg1414xxx  sequence changes identified by sequence analysis
were confirmed by restriction endonuclease or heteroduplex
analysis. restriction endonucleases were purchased from new
england biolabs (www.neb.com). a total of 10 sequence changes
resulted in either the creation or loss of a naturally occurring
restriction site. five sequence changes were confirmed by analysis
using artificially created restriction sites. digestions were performed under conditions recommended by the enzyme manufacturer. five sequence changes (one duplication and four deletions)
detected by sequencing were confirmed by heteroduplex analysis
of pcr products. pcr products were denatured for 4 minutes at
941c prior to electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels (29:1
acrylamide:bisacrylamide). table 3 describes the primers and
restriction enzymes used to detect sequence changes.
results

two mutations in the  xxxg1414xxx  gene coding sequence
and/or flanking region were identified in 35  xxxg1414xxx  patients
and a single mutation was identified in two patients.
none of these mutations was detected in 100 control
alleles. mutations were identified in exons 2–7. no
mutations were detected in exon 1, which is likely
untranslated due to the presence of an in-frame stop
codon that precedes the first in-frame atg in exon 2.
novel  xxxg1414xxx  mutations

mutations are listed in table 1 and figure 1. details of
mutation confirmation analysis are described in table 3.
c.64c4t (r22x) . this c4t sequence change at
position c.64 results in a nonsense mutation by changing
an arginine codon at position 22 to a stop codon in exon
2 and is common to both wg1449 and wg1588 cell
lines in heteroallelic form.
c.161g4a (w54x) . cell line wg2578 is heteroallelic
for a g4a sequence change at c.161, which results in
the substitution of a stop signal for tryptophan at codon
54 in exon 2.
c.266t4c (l89p) . a  xxxd3355xxx  nucleotide change at
position c.266 in exon 2 results in the substitution of
proline for leucine at codon 89. the leucine residue is
conserved between mouse and human and occurs within
the mitochondrial leader sequence, which is not present
in orthologous polypeptides of esherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and archeoglobus fulgidus. this change
was detected in two cell lines, wg1449 and wg2578, in
heteroallelic form.
c.387c4a (y129x) . cell line wg3009 is homoallelic
for a nonsense mutation in exon 2 at position c.387

figure 1. the exon structure of the  xxxg1414xxx  gene (nt _016606.16) and the position of mutations identi¢ed with the corresponding
amino acid change. the introns are drawn to scale except where ‘‘//’’ denotes a region longer than indicated. see dobson et al.
[2002] for structural organization of the  xxxg1414xxx  gene.

due to a  xxxg283xxx  nucleotide change. this results in
the replacement of tyrosine by a stop codon at amino
acid 129.
c.433c4t (r145x) . this  xxxg283xxx  sequence change
occurs in exon 2 at position c.433 and it accounts for
31 of 72 (b43%) pathogenic alleles in this panel of  xxxg1414xxx 
patients. arginine is converted to a stop signal at codon
145. a total of 10 patients were homoallelic and 11
patients were heteroallelic for this mutation (table 1).
this mutation was not detected in 182 control alleles
examined.
c.434g4a (r145q) . cell line wg1191 is homoallelic
for a g4a nucleotide change at position c.434.
arginine is converted to a glutamine at codon 145. this
residue is conserved between human, mouse, e. coli and
m. tuberculosis, but not with a. fulgidus, which has valine
at this position, five amino acids upstream of the walker
a motif.
c.439+1 _4delgtca. this deletion results in a splice
site defect. four bases, gtca, are deleted at the exon 2
donor splice site. cell line wg1776 is heteroallelic for
this sequence change.
c.440g4a (e147g) . the first nucleotide of exon 3,
c.440, is converted from g4a, resulting in the
substitution of glycine for  xxxd2431xxx  at amino acid
position 147. this amino acid is conserved between
human, mouse, e. coli, m. tuberculosis, and a. fulgidus,
and it is three amino acids upstream of the walker a
motif. cell line wg1518 is heteroallelic for this sequence
change.

c.450 _451insg. an insertion of a guanine nucleotide at

cdna position 450–451 of exon 3 results in a frame shift
mutation and creation of a stop signal downstream at
amino acid position 169. cell lines wg1518, wg2185,
and wg2893 are heteroallelic for this insertion.
c.503delc. a cytosine deletion was detected at
position c.503 in exon 3. a truncated protein product
is predicted from this mutation. cell line wg3003 is
heteroallelic for this mutation.
c.653g4a (g218e) . cell lines wg1588 and wg2188
are both heteroallelic for a point mutation at position
c.653 in exon 4, a g4a change that results in a glycine
to a  xxxd2431xxx  substitution at codon 218. the glycine
residue is highly conserved between human, mouse,
e. coli, m. tuberculosis, and a. fulgidus. this residue is
located between the predicted mg2+ binding site and
walker b motif of the polypeptide chain.
c.733+1g4a. cell line wg2623 is homoallelic for a
g4a nucleotide change at splice site position c.733+1
in intron 4. disruption of  xxxg1414xxx  transcript processing is
predicted.
c.742c4t (q248x) . sequence analysis of dna from
cell line wg2230 revealed a heteroallelic point mutation
at position c.742 in exon 5. a c4t nucleotide change
results in the substitution of a stop signal for a glutamine
residue at codon 248.
c.959g4a (w320x) . a homoallelic nonsense mutation was found in cell line wg2627 at codon 320 of exon
6 as the result of a g4a sequence change at position
c.959.

lerner-ellis et al.

c.970^2a4t. cell line wg1798 is heteroallelic for a

splice site mutation at position 2 of the intron 6–exon
7 boundary.
c.988c4t (r330x) . the wg2063 cell line is homoallelic for a c4t nucleotide change at position c.988 in
exon 7, resulting in the creation of a nonsense mutation
at codon 330. the mutation is 37 amino acids
downstream of a predicted gtp binding site.
c.1076g4a (r359q) . sequence analysis of dna from
the wg3084 cell line revealed a heteroallelic g4a
change at nucleotide position c.1076 in exon 7. cell line
wg2704 is homoallelic for this sequence change. this
alteration results in the conversion of the normal
arginine codon to a glutamine codon at position 359,
resulting in a charge change at this site. the c.1076
guanine nucleotide is highly conserved between human,
mouse, e. coli, m. tuberculosis, and a. fulgidus.
c.1089_1090delga . this mutation occurs in exon 7.
guanine and adenine are deleted at positions
c.1089_1090, resulting in a frameshift. cell line
wg2188 is heteroallelic for this mutation.

(c.260_267dupataaactt,
c.283c4t
(q95x),
c.592_595delactg
and
c.620a4g (y207c)) previously identified by dobson
et al. [2002] were confirmed in the originally described
patients and tested for in the remainder of the 32 patient
cell lines. the nomenclature of mutations, c.260_267dupataaactt and c.592_595delactg, have been changed from their original designation [dobson et al., 2002]
to adhere to current guidelines [den dunnen and
antonarakis, 2000]. the c.283c4t (q95x) mutation,
initially reported in cell line wg1776, was also observed
in one additional cell line: wg1798. the c.592_595delactg frameshift mutation was originally detected in
cell lines wg1192, wg2014, and wg3080. this
sequence change was also observed in three additional
cell lines: wg2664, wg1516, and wg2922. cell line
wg1192 is homoallelic and the five other cell lines are
heteroallelic.

snps

five single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were
observed in intronic regions: c.1–56a4g (rs4835011),
c.439+108a4g
(rs4835012),
c.734–74g4a
(rs11721510), c.820–169t4c (rs2279717), and
c.820–110a4g. snps c.734–74g4a and c.820–
110a4g were not previously documented. table 4 lists
the allelic frequencies of snps in patients and controls.
interestingly, c.820–110a4g was not found in any of
the controls from our panel, but is present in 31 out of 74
patient alleles, all in patients with the c.433c4t
mutation. a sequence change at position c.1089g4c
(rs2270655), which results in a q363h amino acid
change, was identified in 4 out of 100 control alleles in
heteroallelic form. a silent sequence change, c.747g4a
(s249s), was detected in homoallelic form in cell line
wg2627, and in 6 out of 100 control alleles in
heteroallelic form.

haplotypes of patients with the c.433c4t (r145x)
and c.592 _595delactg mutations. haplotypes were constructed using the genotypes of patients for the polymorphisms:
c.1^56a4g, c.439+108a4g, c.734^74g4a, c.820^169t4c,
and c.820^110a4g within the  xxxg1414xxx  gene. results are shown
for patients that were homozygous for either c.433c4t (n=10)
or c.592_595del (n=1), or heterozygous for both (n=4). patients
carrying these mutations are listed intable 1.

haplotype analysis

haplotypes were constructed from genotype data for
patients homoallelic for the c.433c4t and
c.592_595delactg mutations using five snp markers
detected by sequencing analysis (c.1–56a4g
(rs4835011), c.439+108a4g (rs4835012), c.734–
74g4a (rs11721510), c.820–169t4c (rs2279717),
and c.820–110a4g). these markers span 14,801 bp
from intron 1 to intron 5. a common haplotype was
observed in patients with each of these mutations
(fig. 2).
discussion

in this study, we report the identification of 18 novel
mutations in the  xxxg1414xxx  gene of  xxxg1414xxx  patients. four
previously identified disease-causing mutations in
 xxxg1414xxx  reported in five  xxxg1414xxx  patients [dobson et al.,
2002] were confirmed, and second mutations were
identified in two of these patients (cell lines wg1776
and wg2014). in total, 22 mutations have been
identified: 13 result in premature stop codons, including
three deletions, one insertion, and one duplication; three
are splice site defects; and six are missense mutations
that occur at highly conserved residues. two mutations

mutations in the mmma gene

were identified in 35 patients, consistent with autosomal
recessive inheritance of the  xxxg1414xxx  disorder, and one
mutation was identified in two patients. none of the
sequence changes identified in  xxxg1414xxx  patients was found
in a minimum of 100 alleles from unrelated control
individuals.
common mutations

several mutations were identified in more than one
individual. the c.433c4t (r145x) mutation was
identified in 21 patients; this sequence change accounts
for b43% of pathogenic alleles in this panel of  xxxg1414xxx 
patients. all patients homozygous for the c.433c4t
mutation were also homozygous at five snps within the
 xxxg1414xxx  gene (fig. 2), allowing definition of a common
haplotype associated with this mutation. the c.820–
110a4g snp was seen only in patients carrying the
c.433c4t mutation and not detected in any controls
from our sample. genotypes of patients heterozygous for
the c.433c4t mutation were also consistent with the
occurrence of c.433c4t on the same haplotype. this
mutation was observed primarily in patients of european
ancestry, but was also detected in heterozygous form in a
black individual and one of mixed asian and european
origin. these data suggest a common ancestor for the
c.433c4t mutation.
the c.592_595delactg mutation was identified in
six individuals, five of whom were of european origin;
information on the ethnic background of the sixth
patient was unavailable. cell line wg1192 is homozygous for this deletion and was also homozygous across
five intronic snps (fig. 2), allowing inference of a
haplotype associated with this mutation. the genotypes
of the remaining five patients who carry this deletion in
heterozygote form are consistent with the mutation being
on the same haplotype as in cell line wg1192. four
patients were compound heterozygote for c.592_595delactg and c.433c4t mutations. genotypes of these
individuals were consistent with the haplotypes defined
in patients homozygous for these mutations.
other common mutations identified in more than one
individual include c.64c4t (r22x), c.266t4c
(l89p), c.653g4a (g218e), c.283c4t (q95x),
c.450_451insg, and c.1076g4a (r359q). further
study will be necessary to determine if common
mutations are being transmitted on the same genetic
background.
genotype^phenotype correlation

no direct correlations could be made between the
mutations identified in the  xxxg1414xxx  gene and clinical
severity or the degree of impairment of cobalamin
metabolism observed in tissue culture studies. clinically,
there was not much variation in presentation among the
 xxxg1414xxx  patients in the present study. all patients presented
during infancy or childhood with signs of metabolic
acidosis. variation in age of onset may be at least partly
explained by environment, since in several cases,
patients with childhood onset were reported to be

515

self-limiting their protein intake prior to diagnosis. the
age of onset of patients homozygous for the
c.433c4t mutation varied from the neonatal period
to 10 years of age. this suggests that environmental
factors, genetic modifiers, or both, may affect the clinical
presentation of the  xxxg1414xxx  disorder. interestingly, of all the
 xxxd1771xxx  inborn errors of metabolism, the  xxxg1414xxx 
patients are the most responsive clinically to vitamin
b12 supplementation.
the  xxxg1414xxx  gene has four sequence motifs that define
the argk subfamily of g3e gtpases, including the
walker a motif, a mg2+-binding aspartate residue, the
walker b motif, and a gtp-binding motif, as described by
leipe et al. [2002]. the function of the  xxxg1414xxx  gene
product is not known and it is currently not possible to
predict functional effects of missense mutations. a role
for the  xxxg1414xxx  gene product has recently been
suggested. a  xxxg1414xxx  homologue, meab from methylobacterium extorquens, was hypothesized to protect mcm
from irreversible inactivation. meab was shown to bind
mcm and suggested to stabilize the dimer form of the
enzyme and/or to protect bound cofactor from attack by
oxygen, water, and highly reactive radical intermediates
[korotkova and lidstrom, 2004]. further investigation of
defects in  xxxg1414xxx  will be critical to our understanding of
the human  xxxg1414xxx  gene product and to its role in
patients with the  xxxg1414xxx  disorder.
