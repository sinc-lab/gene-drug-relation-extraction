objective:

to provide information about research evaluating
antioxidants in  xxxg178xxx  (ad) and to discuss the potential
role of beta-blockers,  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors,
clonidine, guanfacine,  xxxd2728xxx , and ergoloid derivatives in ad
therapy.
data sources: studies, review articles, and editorials identified from
medline searches (from 1989 to 1997) and bibliographies of
identified articles.
study selection: studies and review articles addressing antioxidant,
antihypertensive, and ergoloid derivative pharmacotherapy research.
data extraction: pertinent information was selected and the data
synthesized into a review format.
data synthesis: ad is a progressive neuropsychiatric disorder of
unknown etiology. studies evaluating the possible association
between a free radical mechanism in ad and the potential role of
antioxidants are reviewed. additionally, the role of beta-blockers,
 xxxg36xxx  inhibitors, clonidine, guanfacine,
 xxxd2728xxx , and ergoloid derivatives in ad management are
discussed.
conclusions: preliminary evidence suggests that antioxidants may
have a protective effect against the development of ad. additional
prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are needed to
determine the role of antioxidants in the prevention and
management of ad. understanding the role of antioxidants in ad
may suggest alternative agents that have similar pharmacologic
activity. beta-blockers may be an option to control agitation in ad
patients for whom anxiolytics or antipsychotics are ineffective or are
contraindicated because of their adverse effect profiles. other agents
that may have a role in ad therapy include angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors,  xxxd2728xxx , and ergoloid derivatives. clonidine
and guanfacine have thus far shown little promise in improving
cognitive function in ad. further prospective, double-blind,

lzheimer disease (ad) is a progressive neurologic
disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration and
cognitive deterioration. ad prevalence illustrates an exponential rise with age, approximately doubling each fiveyear period, from a 1% incidence at age 65 years to 16–20%
at 85 years.1 currently, ad is estimated to comprise approximately 50% of all dementia cases. the impact on patient, family, and caregiver resources and on medical expenses for this illness is enormous. ad is associated with
significant hardship for victims, their families, and caregivers. effective treatment and prevention strategies, and
management of attendant behavioral disturbances, are
paramount to the management of this illness. this article
provides information about research evaluating antioxidants in ad and discusses the potential role of beta-blockers,
 xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors, clonidine, guanfacine,  xxxd2728xxx , and ergoloid derivatives in
ad therapy.

free radical formation in  xxxg178xxx ?
research is being conducted regarding free radical damage in the pathogenesis of ad. oxidative stress is theorized to cause unbound oxygen radical formation with resultant neurodegeneration and possible plaque formation
in the central nervous system. antioxidants, including alphatocopherol and  xxxd228xxx , are free radical scavengers of
theoretical therapeutic value that have been studied for
amelioration of free radical damage.2

possible mechanisms of free radical scavengers in
 xxxg178xxx 
the significance of free radical formation has been studied in the pathophysiology of many neurologic disorders.
the brain is particularly vulnerable to free radical formation and damage, given the brain’s demand for oxygen.
the basal ganglia are exquisitely susceptible to oxidative
destruction because they possess abundant catecholamines
such as dopamine.3 these catecholamines may autoxidize
to form free radicals or augment free radical formation via
metabolism by  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx , forming hydrogen
peroxide.4 the brain is also abundant in iron, which is vital
in the creation of oxyradicals.5-8 however, the brain has a
relatively low concentration of antioxidant enzymes.9
several approaches have been used to examine free radical formation and oxidative brain damage in ad. one
method is to determine the presence of enhanced lipid peroxidation, by an increase in thiobarbituric acid–reactive
substances (tbars).10 another method, frank determination of free radicals, uses electron spin resonance, but is
impractical in vivo.
free radical generation may not be the principal factor in
ad pathogenesis and may occur in addition to other mechanisms. secondary free radical formation may indeed augment ad progression. despite technical challenges in free
radical detection, presumptive evidence would exist if antioxidant therapy thwarts or delays the progression of ad.4
the role of free radical formation in ad, and the corresponding potential for antioxidant therapy, has been examined in the rat model. the major constituent of senile
plaques, beta-amyloid protein, is theorized to possess a direct
neurotoxic action. this neurotoxicity is thought to be the
result of its ability to construct ca2+-permeable pores in
membranes, resulting in ca2+ influx, with ensuing initiation of neurotoxic cascades. additionally, beta-amyloid exposure to ca2+-mediated augmentation in free radical formation may surpass cellular defensive mechanisms.11

superoxide dismutase and catalase
among the antioxidant enzymes in the brain are glutathione peroxidase and  xxxg981xxx , catalase,
and superoxide dismutase. superoxide dismutase catalyzes
the dismutation of the superoxide radical to oxygen and
 xxxd2298xxx . glutathione peroxidase and catalase,
in turn, can reduce  xxxd2298xxx  to water.
superoxide dismutase is overabundant by approximately 50% in down syndrome patients, compared with the
healthy population.12,13 down syndrome patients develop
brain abnormalities similar to those seen in patients with
ad. this observation led to further investigation that free
radical formation may also be involved in ad pathophysiology. skin-cultured fibroblasts from both familial and
sporadic ad cases (with age-matched controls) have served
as a means to study free radical activity. tesco et al.13 reported that patients with ad were more susceptible to free
radical damage than were controls.

greater susceptibility to free radical–induced damage
due to diminished tocopherol brain concentrations has also
been investigated. some investigators have noted decreased  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations in brain tissue of patients
who had ad, but others have not found this effect.14-16
adams et al.16 demonstrated a doubling of midbrain tocopherol concentrations in patients who had ad, compared
with control patients.
goodman and mattson17 demonstrated that amyloid betaprotein augmented calcium and free radical genesis in rat
hippocampal cultures. calcium and free radical genesis
were both reduced by  xxxd3521xxx . lockhart et al.11 also examined inhibitors of free radical formation with beta-amyloid25-35 peptide–mediated neurotoxicity induced in rat hippocampal cultures. cultures of beta-amyloid25-35 peptide and
inhibitors were incubated in rat hippocampal cultures. specific inhibitors of  xxxg2431xxx  and/or  xxxd2738xxx  synthase ( xxxd3291xxx ), nomega-nitro-l-arginine, allopurinol,  xxxd2818xxx , important factors of superoxide,  xxxd2738xxx , and hydroxyl radical formation did not lessen
beta-amyloid neurotoxicity. furthermore, cultures exposed to
superoxide dismutase, catalase, and free radical scavengers
including  xxxd228xxx ,  xxxd3521xxx , l-cysteine,  xxxd68xxx , glutathione, hemoglobin, or  xxxd1824xxx  failed
to alter the neurotoxic activity of beta-amyloid. this study
also suggested that subtoxic concentrations of beta-amyloid
augmented neuronal susceptibility to  xxxd2298xxx 
exposure and that the presence of beta-amyloid may promote
neuronal vulnerability to free radical assault. however, this
escalation in free radical formation is not the primary mechanism for in vitro beta-amyloid–mediated neurotoxicity. dyrks
et al.18 revealed that metal-catalyzed oxidation conferred
amyloidogenic activity to amyloid protein precursor fragments. furthermore, behl et al.19 demonstrated that vitamin
e protected rat nerve cells from beta-amyloid protein damage.

thiobarbituric acid–reactive substances and brain
antioxidant enzymes
evidence of brain lipid peroxidation may be detected
with concentrations of tbars from brain tissue. lovell et
al.10 evaluated autopsy brain specimens from 10 control
patients and 13 ad patients (mean age 77.5 y) who met
the national institute of neurological and communicative
disorders and stroke–alzheimer’s disease and related
disorders association (nincds-adrda) work group
criteria20 for probable ad. the investigators10 noted elevated concentrations of tbars in the hippocampus, superior
and middle temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobe, amygdala,
pyriform cortex, cerebellum, and occipital pole. these elevations achieved statistical significance (p < 0.05) in comparison with control brain tbars for the pyriform cortex
and hippocampus, and marginal significance in the amygdala (p < 0.07). superoxide dismutase concentrations were
increased in all of the aforementioned brain areas and in
the middle frontal gyrus, although not to statistically significant concentrations. significant concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (p < 0.05) were present in hippocam-

pal areas in ad brains; statistically significant (p < 0.05)
 xxxg981xxx  concentrations were discovered in
the hippocampus and amygdala. catalase activity was also
noted to be significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in the superior
and middle temporal gyri and in the hippocampus in ad
patients. such elevations in the aforementioned antioxidant
enzymes in areas of pronounced lipid peroxidation may
represent a compensatory increase to handle the augmented free radical formation.
de la torre et al.21 evaluated superoxide dismutase and
catalase activity in 16 patients with stroke, five patients
with parkinson’s disease, 17 patients with dementia, and
22 healthy age-matched controls. red blood cells were
measured for superoxide dismutase activity, and hemolysates were evaluated for catalase activity. the investigators
detected significantly (p < 0.05) decreased catalase activity
and normal superoxide dismutase concentrations in the
subjects with dementia. reynolds and cutts12 discovered a
15–30% increase in tbars reactivity in the cerebral cortex and temporal areas of ad patients when compared
with control subject brains. using tbars methodology,
richardson et al.22 also noted enhanced lipid peroxidation
in the frontal cortex of ad patients.

antioxidants
based on evidence of free radical formation and oxidative stress, trials with antioxidants as preventive agents
against ad have been suggested.23,24 a major preventive
strategy would be to delay the age of ad onset. a postponement by five years would reduce the prevalence of
ad by 50% in one generation; a 10-year delay would decrease prevalence by 75% in a generation.24
antioxidants, such as  xxxd228xxx  and  xxxd3521xxx , are
free radical scavengers that have been evaluated in the
treatment of several neurologic disorders.  xxxd3521xxx  has
been the most widely studied antioxidant.  xxxd3521xxx 
analogs have shown promise as free radical scavengers in
laboratory animals.25 therapeutic advantages of antioxidants such as  xxxd228xxx  and  xxxd3521xxx  include ready
availability and low cost. a free radical hypothesis has also
been investigated with respect to parkinson’s disease. the
deprenyl and tocopherol antioxidative therapy of parkinsonism study26 evaluated the use of  xxxd3521xxx  and selegiline in parkinson’s disease patients. the investigators
did not demonstrate a delay in the progression of the disease with tocopherol. fahn27 evaluated combination highdose  xxxd3521xxx  (3200 iu/d) and  xxxd228xxx  (3000 mg/d) in
patients with parkinson’s disease. the investigator documented that the multiple antioxidant regimen delayed the
need for l-dopa treatment by 2.5 years.
 xxxd3521xxx  has been evaluated as a single agent for
treatment in clinical ad trials and in conjunction with selegiline. a 1997 study28 evaluated  xxxd3521xxx ’s role in
the treatment of moderately impaired patients with probable ad in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial. the investigators evaluated  xxxd3521xxx , selegiline, or both as a treatment for ad. the primary

focus of this trial was to ascertain if these therapeutic agents
affected the time to achieve significant functional decline.
selegiline was included since it may function as an antioxidant and reduce oxidative deamination and resultant neuronal toxicity. furthermore, selegiline enhances catecholamine concentrations, and adrenergic stimulation may ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in ad.
three hundred forty-one patients from 23 participating
centers in the alzheimer’s disease cooperative study received  xxxd3521xxx  (1000 iu bid), selegiline (5 mg bid),
both agents, or placebo for 24 months.28 patients had a
baseline clinical dementia rating29 score of 2 (moderate
dementia). study subjects were living at home or in a supervised-care setting, but not in skilled nursing facilities.28
a composite end point of primary outcome measures included institutionalization, loss of ability to perform activities of daily living, severe dementia (defined as a rating of
3 with the clinical dementia rating scale), or death. secondary outcome measures included the mini-mental state
examination (mmse),30 the cognitive portion of the alzheimer’s disease assessment scale,31 the blessed dementia scale,32 the presence or absence of extrapyramidal side
effects (eps), and other measures of function and behavior. secondary outcome measures were evaluated with the
use of anova, ancova, and survival analyses.28
refer to table 1 for baseline mmse and blessed dementia scale scores. clinical assessments, including routine blood measurements and urinalysis, weight, and vital
signs were conducted during all clinic appointments. clinic visits were conducted four weeks after study enrollment
and at three-month periods during the two-year study. primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at each interval. serum tocopherol and urine amphetamine concentrations were used to monitor concentrations of  xxxd3521xxx 
and selegiline, respectively.28
the investigators noted that baseline mmse scores
were highest in the group receiving placebo and lowest in
the group receiving  xxxd3521xxx  (p = 0.071) (table 1).
mean changes in performance on the cognitive portion of
the alzheimer’s disease assessment scale did not differ

significantly among the groups (p = 0.17). no differences
were noted in eps frequency. with baseline mmse scores
as a covariate, the estimated median survival was increased
by 215 days (risk ratio 0.57; p = 0.012) in the selegilineonly group, 230 days (risk ratio 0.47; p = 0.001) in the alphatocopherol treatment group, and 145 days (risk ratio 0.69;
p = 0.049) in the combination group, compared with placebo. the investigators concluded that selegiline and  xxxd3521xxx  appeared to be effective in delaying functional deterioration in moderately impaired ad patients. no improvement in therapeutic efficacy was noted with combination
therapy, in comparison with monotherapy.28
no significant difference in the development of adverse
effects, including gastrointestinal, dermatologic, psychiatric, and cardiac adverse effects, was noted between the
groups. increased syncope and risk of falling was observed
in the treatment groups, particularly in the combination
treatment group. the basis for these events is unclear, as
these adverse effects have been reported with selegiline,
but not with  xxxd3521xxx . falls and syncope were not severe enough, however, to necessitate drug discontinuation.
no significant differences in weight change, laboratory
values, or vital signs were noted. the rate of death was reportedly 10.3%, and no specific pattern in the cause of
death was associated with treatment. as both selegiline
and  xxxd3521xxx  demonstrated comparable efficacy, cost
issues and adverse effect profiles are important clinical
considerations in determining which agent to use.28
although the results are encouraging, some clinicians
have cautioned about overzealous interpretation of these
preliminary study results.28 drachman and leber33 noted
that the study design and statistical analyses are very complex and subject to differences in interpretation. the cox
proportional-hazards statistical model, the problems of
multiple comparisons, and whether a correction for multiple comparisons is possible or appropriate are factors worthy of clinical consideration. randomization did not result
in comparable mmse scores between groups. additionally, the primary outcomes were statistically adjusted for
baseline mmse scores. furthermore, comment33 has been
made regarding the baseline status of study subjects, which
revealed that approximately 20% required help with one of
the three assessed activities of daily living.
the risks associated with antioxidants may not be insignificant. the  xxxd3521xxx ,  xxxd3105xxx  cancer
prevention study34 has raised some clinical concern regarding the potential for hemorrhagic stroke in patients
taking  xxxd3521xxx . additionally, clinical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased lung cancer risk in
smokers receiving beta-carotene. further study is needed to
fully clarify the risk of adverse effects, if any, with antioxidants. additional upper limit dosage recommendations in
the elderly should be explored.

carbon-based free radicals, in combination with ascorbic
acid and  xxxd3521xxx , has been shown to heighten acquisition and memory retention skills of aged rats.35 sack et
al.36 evaluated the effect of phenyl-alpha-tert-butyl nitrone
monotherapy on aging rats (24 mo) for ≤9.5 months. the
investigators noted an improvement in two cognitive performance morris water maze tasks, diminished lipid peroxidation in the globus pallidus and neocortex, and increased survival time (as evidenced by the log-rank test for
survivorship [chi(1) = 4.74; p < 0.05]).
euk-8

euk-8 is a synthetic catalytic superoxide and hydrogen
peroxide scavenger. musleh et al.37 demonstrated the
saleno-manganese complex euk-8 produced protection
against acidosis and hypoxia-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal slices. subsequently, bruce et al.38 evaluated the
efficacy of euk-8 on free radical–mediated beta-amyloid
peptide–induced neurotoxicity. neuronal injury was induced by  xxxg178xxx  at various concentrations in rat
hippocampal cultures. euk-8 was added to some cultures
and the effect on neurotoxicity was assessed up to 72 hours
later. mature hippocampal slices exposed to euk-8 25 µm
were significantly protected (p < 0.05) from  xxxg178xxx –induced free radical damage. additionally, euk-8
also significantly obstructed (p < 0.05) beta-amyloid
peptide–induced free radical buildup and lipid peroxidation.

antioxidants in  xxxg178xxx  prevention:
confounding therapeutic factors
several confounding factors, identified by evans and
morris,23 exist with the use of antioxidants for the prevention of ad. antioxidants have not been studied extensively in the elderly population. some currently unidentified
adverse effects of antioxidants in the elderly could exist.
another therapeutic issue is the age at which antioxidant
therapy should begin, and what doses would be necessary
for a protective influence against ad. many questions regarding the efficacy and safety of prophylactic antioxidants in ad prevention remain unanswered. would prophylaxis with more than one antioxidant achieve superior
outcomes compared with single antioxidant use? would
dietary sources of antioxidants be superior to exogenously
supplied agents?23 randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trials of antioxidants and studies comparing antioxidants against other preventive strategies, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, are needed.

type distribution alterations is unknown. beta-blockers, including propranolol and  xxxd2957xxx , have been used to manage behavioral disturbances in ad patients. beta-blockers are
theorized to augment presynaptic norepinephrine production in response to postsynaptic antagonism, with resultant
enhanced noradrenergic activity and diminished rage reaction.42 specific behavioral disturbances, including aggression, assaultive behavior, hostility, agitation, and restlessness, may be diminished with beta-blockers.
 xxxd2957xxx , which possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic
activity, may provide therapeutic advantages similar to
those of propranolol, but with fewer adverse effects. greendyke and kanter43 evaluated  xxxd2957xxx  in a double-blind,
crossover study. eleven patients (average age 60 y) with
various organic brain syndromes received  xxxd2957xxx  60–100
mg/d. each assaultive behavioral episode was reported on
an incident report every shift by inpatient nursing staff.
two staff members monitored the study subjects during
waking hours to ensure that virtually every aggressive
episode would be detected. one of the study investigators
also completed daily behavioral assessments, during which
uncooperativeness, hostility, uncommunicativeness, repetitive behaviors, and lethargy were assessed. a rating scale
ranked from 1 (symptom not present) to 5 (severe, disabling symptom present) was used. the investigators noted a significant reduction in uncommunicativeness (p <
0.025), hostility (p < 0.05), uncooperativeness (p < 0.025),
and repetitive behaviors (p < 0.01). the optimal  xxxd2957xxx 
maintenance dosage identified was 40 – 60 mg/d. no significant adverse effects were noted.
greendyke et al.44 conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study in a neurobehavioral intensive
care unit. ten organic brain syndrome patients (age 27–75
y) were evaluated and randomly assigned to receive placebo or sustained-release propranolol. following a dosage
titration period, subjects received propranolol 520 mg/d or
placebo for 11 weeks of the study. after the dosage was tapered to discontinuation, study subjects receiving active
drug were then switched to placebo for the duration of the
trial. participants originally receiving 11 weeks of placebo
were crossed over to receive propranolol using the same
titration schedule and 11-week regimen of propranolol 520
mg/d as the first active treatment group. the complete
study, including active drug and placebo arms, continued
for 25 weeks.
propranolol efficacy was evaluated by two staff nurses
in the neurobehavioral intensive care unit. patients were
monitored during waking hours, and episodes of assaultiveness were recorded by the nursing staff. propranolol reportedly diminished aggression in these patients, with fewer assaults and attempted assaults occurring in the propranolol-treated patients compared with the placebo-treated
group (f = 6.50 [1.7 df]; p < 0.05, anova).44
several case reports have been published regarding the
use of propranolol in agitated ad patients. weiler et al.42
surveyed the effects of propranolol in six patients in a
skilled nursing facility who had been diagnosed with senile
dementia characterized by agitation. propranolol doses

ranged from 80 to 560 mg/d. these patients previously developed intolerable adverse effects to sedatives and neuroleptics. no adverse effects to propranolol were reported
in any of the cases. greendyke et al.45 related the use of
propranolol in eight male patients (average age 52 y) with
organic brain syndrome characterized by assaultiveness,
pacing, and verbal outbursts. propranolol doses ranged
from 200 to 520 mg/d. improved behavior was noted in
seven patients; one patient was not able to tolerate a dosage exceeding 160 mg daily, due to hypotension. shankle
et al.46 studied low-dose propranolol in elderly patients
with dementia. twelve patients with dementia and diagnoses of possible or probable ad (nincds-adrda criteria) and diagnoses of probable or possible vascular dementia (alzheimer’s disease diagnostic and treatment
center47) were evaluated.46 this trial was not randomized
or placebo-controlled and used nonstandardized instruments. study subjects were evaluated for agitation based
on ordinal ratings of aggression severity, including the california behavior questionnaire47 and cohen-mansfield
agitation inventory.48 subjects received a propranolol dosage of 10–80 mg daily, with a statistically significant (p <
0.003) reduction in severity of aggression.46 most subjects
demonstrated a clinical response within two weeks of initiating propranolol. only one woman with heart disease experienced bradycardia, which dissipated with a reduction
in propranolol dosage from 60 to 30 mg daily.45
beta-blockers should be increased gradually in elderly individuals, with stringent pulse rate and blood pressure
monitoring and must be used cautiously in patients with
diabetes, asthma, heart failure, bradycardia, and depression. given propranolol’s highly lipophilic properties, clinicians must also be vigilant for the development of central
nervous system adverse effects, to which the elderly are
exceedingly susceptible. central nervous system adverse
effects such as insomnia, confusion, nightmares, and hallucinations are possible and are more commonly encountered in the elderly. orthostatic hypotension may also be
problematic, with increased risk of hip fracture secondary
to orthostasis-related falls. precipitous discontinuation of
beta-blockers may trigger rebound hypertension and  xxxd1914xxx 
episodes in patients with ischemic heart disease. cardiac
arrhythmias and myocardial infarction are also possible
outcomes from abrupt cessation of beta-blockers.
although they are not generally first-choice antihypertensives in the elderly due to potentially significant adverse
effects, beta-blockers may be an effective therapeutic option
in elderly patients requiring antihypertensive management
and regulation of agitation. anxiolytics and antipsychotics,
and their attendant adverse effect profiles, may preclude
their use in the management of agitation and aggressive
behavior in the ad patient. eps and tardive dyskinesia are
potential adverse effects of antipsychotics. specifically,
akathisia (restless leg syndrome) may be effectively treated
with propranolol.49-51 beta-blockers may, therefore, offer more
advantageous adverse effect profiles in select patients.
many elderly also experience essential familial tremor,
which may be effectively treated by propranolol.52-54

 xxxg36xxx  inhibitors

ace and  xxxg99xxx  may be involved in cognitive
function. in animals,  xxxg99xxx  decreases learning,55
whereas ace inhibitors improve memory function.56 in a
study of antihypertensive therapy and quality of life,57 308
hypertensive men (aged 21–65 y) treated with captopril 50
mg twice daily had greater improvement (p < 0.05) in a
measure of cognitive function than did subjects treated
with methyldopa 500 mg twice daily.
the effects of ceranapril (ceronapril) on cognitive function in ad were explored in a pilot study58 of patients with
a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate ad who met diagnostic
and statistical manual of mental disorders, 3rd edition
(dsm-iii)59 criteria. subjects were normotensive (systolic
blood pressure ≤165 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure
≤95 mm hg).58 an mmse score between 12 and 26 inclusive and a global deterioration scale60 score between 3
and 5 were needed for participation in the study. the
study58 used a three-way block design. subjects completed
three five-week treatment intervals, the order of which was
randomized. each treatment interval consisted of a oneweek, single-blind treatment with placebo followed by a
four-week, double-blind treatment with placebo or ceranapril (5 or 40 mg bid). thirty subjects were included in
the study; one withdrew during single-blind placebo treatment. mean age was 67.5 years (range 54–75). cognitive
assessments occurred at entry, at the end of each singleblind phase, and at the end of each double-blind phase.
the assessments, which included the computerized neuropsychological test battery61 and noncomputerized test
batteries, yielded no significant results (p > 0.05).58 there
were no clinically significant adverse events. because a
trend consistent with drug effect appeared between placebo and high-dose ceranapril test scores, a study with a
larger sample and a longer duration of treatment, and possibly higher drug dosages, may be appropriate.
clonidine and guanfacine

cortical noradrenergic innervation is diminished in autopsy examinations of ad brains.62,63 clonidine and guanfacine, both centrally acting alpha-2 agonists, improved
cognitive performance in aged rhesus monkeys.64,65 guanfacine has been studied as an alternative to clonidine that
produces less sedation.
the cognitive effects of clonidine were examined in two
studies66,67 of patients meeting the criteria of dsm-iii and
nincds-adrda for ad. in both studies, the sample sizes
were small. there were no consistent effects of clonidine
on cognitive function. clonidine treatment was associated
with decreased blood pressure, hypotension, and sedation.
the cognitive effects of guanfacine were examined in
five subjects meeting the dsm-iii criteria and nincdsadrda criteria for ad.68 the degree of baseline cognitive impairment ranged from mild to moderately severe
(range 82–124, mean 101) on the mattis dementia rating
scale.69 age ranged from 54 to 65 years.68 following an

open-label dose-finding phase, the optimal or maximally
tolerated guanfacine dose was compared with placebo in a
randomized, double-blind, crossover phase during which
placebo and guanfacine were given for two weeks. a twoweek washout period separated each crossover arm. a battery of 12 tests of attention, verbal memory, visuospatial
memory, and mood were completed at baseline and at the
end of each treatment phase. there were no significant improvements in cognitive testing during the crossover phase
(p > 0.2). during the dose-finding phase, sedation occurred
in three subjects and hypotension (blood pressure not reported) occurred in three subjects receiving guanfacine
doses of 1–1.5 mg/d.
guanfacine was studied in a 13-week, double-blind
trial70 of 29 subjects meeting dsm-iii criteria for primary
degenerative dementia (pdd) and nincds-adrda criteria for probable ad. the mean age of the subjects was
71 years (range 60–81). the mean mmse score was 22.
following a two-week, single-blind placebo phase, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or
guanfacine 0.5 mg at bedtime for 13 weeks. neuropsychological evaluation occurred at the beginning of the singleblind phase, at the beginning of the double-blind phase,
and at weeks 2, 6, 10, and 13 of the double-blind phase.
fourteen of 15 subjects treated with guanfacine and two of
14 subjects treated with placebo completed the study. reasons for withdrawal from the study were not reported. no
adverse effects were associated with drug therapy. efficacy
analysis revealed no therapeutic benefit of guanfacine. significant differences (p values not reported) on interviewerassessed neuropsychological items (“loses his/her train of
thought during the interview,” “appears depressed, blue,
or despondent”) favored placebo. results on the benton
visual retention-errors71 favored placebo (f = 5.42; p <
0.03).70 evaluation of pre- and posttreatment test results
within the guanfacine and placebo groups identified significant worsening in the guanfacine group but not in the
placebo group on the wechsler paired associates test,72
the benton visual retention-number correct,71 and the
benton visual retention-errors.
clonidine and guanfacine have not been found to enhance cognitive performance in persons with ad. on
some measures, guanfacine may even impair cognitive
performance.
 xxxd2728xxx 

 xxxd2728xxx  is a calcium-channel antagonist used in the
us in the management of subarachnoid hemorrhage. interest in  xxxd2728xxx  as a treatment for dementia relates to the
drug’s potential to protect against calcium-mediated neuron damage.  xxxd2728xxx  may prevent neuronal calcium
influx and, in this manner, decrease neurotoxicity from excitatory amino acids such as glutamate. the relationship
between neuronal calcium homeostasis and excitatory amino
acid receptor activity has been reviewed elsewhere.73
several european clinical trials of  xxxd2728xxx  therapy in
dementia report favorable treatment effects. some trials

classify subjects as having organic brain syndrome or report composite results for pdd and multiinfarct dementia
(mid) subjects.74,75 other trials use an open-label design.76
because ad is the most common diagnostic subtype of
pdd, two placebo-controlled studies of  xxxd2728xxx  in
pdd are reviewed below.
two hundred twenty-seven subjects meeting dsm-iii
criteria for pdd completed a two-week placebo lead-in
period and were randomized to one of three double-blind
treatments: placebo,  xxxd2728xxx  30 mg three times daily,
or  xxxd2728xxx  60 mg three times daily.77 global evaluation, psychometric testing (including the buschke selective
reminding task78), and functional capacity assessments
were made weekly for the first three weeks and then at
two-week intervals.77 mean age of the subjects was 69.5
years, and the mean duration of treatment was 83 days.
baseline evaluation results were not reported. efficacy
analysis was based on data from 195 subjects. compared
with placebo, differences favoring  xxxd2728xxx  30 mg were
found in buschke long-term retrieval (p = 0.056) and longterm storage (p = 0.048). the author noted a strong trend
favoring the  xxxd2728xxx  30-mg group in list learning (p =
0.063). no statistically significant benefits were identified
for subjects receiving  xxxd2728xxx  60 mg compared with
placebo. two subjects in the placebo group withdrew due
to an adverse event, as did one in the  xxxd2728xxx  30-mg
group, and seven in the  xxxd2728xxx  60-mg group. serious
adverse reactions were reported in seven subjects and included urinary frequency, fecal impaction, rash, suspicion,
agitation, flatulence, and nausea. the relationship of these
adverse effects to  xxxd2728xxx  therapy is unclear.
 xxxd2728xxx  was also evaluated in a clinical trial of subjects with pdd and mid.79 these dementia diagnoses
were based on dsm-iii criteria, computed tomography
scans, electroencephalographic (eeg) testing, and the
hachinski ischemic score.80 following a four-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, subjects were randomly
assigned to placebo or  xxxd2728xxx  30 mg three times daily
for a 12-week double-blind treatment phase.79 the primary
evaluation tools were the sandoz clinical assessment —
geriatric scale81 (scag) and the short cognitive performance test (syndrom kurz test82 [skt]). subject age
ranged from 50 to 85 years.79 thirty-two of 61 subjects
treated with  xxxd2728xxx  and 36 of 69 subjects treated with
placebo were diagnosed with pdd. the remaining subjects were diagnosed with mid. the mean scag cognition factor scores at baseline (end of the placebo lead-in
phase) for each treatment– dementia group ranged from
21.6 to 22.8, reflecting moderate-to-severe impairment.
changes within the groups in scag and skt scores between baseline and week 12 evaluations were analyzed.
the mean scag total score increased slightly for placebotreated subjects (70.9 vs. 71.0; p < 0.01) and decreased for
 xxxd2728xxx -treated pdd subjects (71.4 vs. 65.7; p < 0.01)
and  xxxd2728xxx -treated mid subjects (71.8 vs. 66.2; p <
0.05). the mean skt score decreased for placebo-treated
subjects (19.5 vs. 18.6; p < 0.01),  xxxd2728xxx -treated pdd
subjects (19.4 vs. 14.9; p < 0.01), and  xxxd2728xxx -treated
194

mid subjects (19.6 vs. 16.1; p < 0.05). in a post hoc analysis, the mean value differences of each of the 18 scag
cognitive and behavioral items between baseline and week
12 in pdd subjects were compared with the differences in
mid subjects. in 14 items, the mean value difference in
pdd subjects was greater than that for mid subjects, suggesting a greater degree of improvement among pdd subjects in these scag items.
rigorous evaluation of  xxxd2728xxx  therapy in ad needs
to be conducted. in controlled trials, cognitive function in
patients with pdd has improved with  xxxd2728xxx  30 mg
three times daily, but not with 60 mg three times daily. the
dose–response effects of  xxxd2728xxx  need to be examined
further.
ergoloid derivatives

 xxxd2020xxx  and  xxxd2719xxx , available in the us
and europe, respectively, are ergoloid derivatives that have
been used to treat persons with dementia and a variety of
vascular diseases. proposed mechanisms for these agents
in dementia include improvement of central adrenergic,
serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter activity
and improvement of cerebral metabolism.83
in a meta-analysis of clinical trials of  xxxd2020xxx 
in subjects with dementia, 47 studies met criteria for analysis.84 these studies were double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials that (1) specified criteria for sample selection, (2) included elderly study
subjects with possible dementia as evidenced by clinical
descriptions or diagnostic syndromes consistent with possible dementia, (3) specified outcome instruments, and (4)
provided adequate statistical information. effect sizes for
three outcome ratings were determined: comprehensive
rating scores, clinical global impressions, and combined
cognitive–neuropsychological tests. mean subject age per
trial was 59–84 years, when reported. mean trial duration
was 17.1 weeks (range 4 – 60). the mean  xxxd2020xxx  dose per trial ranged from 1.5 to 9 mg per day. in dementia patients,  xxxd2020xxx  were found to be more
effective than placebo in comprehensive ratings (p = 0.0001),
clinical global impressions (p = 0.0001), and combined
cognitive–neuropsychological measures (p = 0.0001).
there were seven studies84 of patients with possible ad.
all were conducted as outpatient studies. the sample size
per trial ranged from 19 to 68 subjects, and the study duration ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. in separate analyses performed on these trials,  xxxd2020xxx  were more effective than placebo as assessed by combined neuropsychological measures in five trials (p = 0.0001); ergoloid
mesylates were no more effective than placebo when assessed with comprehensive ratings (p = 0.18). the effect of
higher dosages (4.5–9 mg/d) was greater than that for lower doses on neuropsychological measures. the authors
characterized the overall effect of  xxxd2020xxx  in
possible ad as very modest at best.
the effects of  xxxd2719xxx  30 mg twice daily in dementia
of the alzheimer type (dat) and mid were examined in a

management of  xxxg178xxx , part ii

double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 98 nursing home
patients older than 60 years.85 subjects met dsm-iii-r criteria86 for dat and had mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment.85 assignment to the dat or mid group was
based on hachinski ischemic score and computed tomography scan results. after a two-week placebo lead-in period, subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment
with placebo or  xxxd2719xxx  30 mg twice daily for an eightweek double-blind phase. evaluation included the clinical
global impression (cgi) score completed at weeks 0 and
8; the scag scale at weeks –2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8; and the
mmse at weeks –2, 0, 4, and 8. eeg measurements were
recorded at weeks 0 and 8. analysis was based on data
from 98 subjects. twenty-four of 48 dat subjects and 24
of 50 mid subjects received  xxxd2719xxx . the median
mmse scores for each treatment– dementia group at the
start of the double-blind phase ranged from 21 to 23.
 xxxd2719xxx  therapy in dat and mid subjects was statistically superior to placebo (p < 0.05) in the cgi score,
mmse score, and scag scale at the end of 8 weeks of
treatment. statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05)
in vigilance were demonstrated by eeg testing in  xxxd2719xxx -treated dat subjects compared with placebo-treated
dat patients. treatment-emergent symptoms were reported in seven  xxxd2719xxx -treated dat subjects: mild itching,
blocked nose, sweating, dry mouth, diarrhea, weight loss,
and constipation (1 subject each); headaches (2 subjects);
and mild tachycardia (2 subjects). four placebo-treated
dat subjects reported symptoms: mild sweating, diarrhea,
weight loss, and moderate dizziness (1 subject each); and
mild dry mouth (2 subjects).
in a comprehensive meta-analysis,84  xxxd2020xxx 
therapy in ad conferred limited benefit as assessed by
cognitive–neuropsychological measures and no apparent
benefit in comprehensive ratings. a dose–response effect
of  xxxd2020xxx  has not been adequately explored.
the short-term effects of  xxxd2719xxx , while encouraging,
need to be confirmed in controlled trials of longer duration.

summary
the precise etiologic mechanisms involved in ad remain
a complex neuropathologic puzzle. until these mechanisms
are revealed, preventive pharmacologic strategies will be
difficult to identify. preliminary suggestions of antioxidant
efficacy in ad prevention and therapy are encouraging.
present clinical strategies include cholinergic therapy for
cognitive dysfunction and management of attendant behavioral disturbances. beta-blockers may be a useful pharmacotherapeutic option in the management of ad -associated
aggression and agitation. clonidine and guanfacine show
little promise in ad management, with significant adverse
effects. ace inhibitors in ad have not been thoroughly
investigated.  xxxd2728xxx  may prove beneficial in the future. in controlled studies of ad,  xxxd2719xxx  has demonstrated promising effects on cognitive function, but further
investigation is warranted.  xxxd2020xxx  have exhib-

ited only modest benefit in ad, although higher doses may
yield enhanced efficacy. expanded placebo-controlled,
double-blinded studies are needed to further illuminate the
role of these agents in the prevention and management of
ad.

extracto
objetivo:

informar sobre las investigaciones evaluando el efecto de los
agentes antioxidantes y discutir el papel potencial de los betabloqueadores, inhibidores de la enzima convertidora de la angiotensina
(eca),  xxxd1728xxx , guanfacina, nimodipina, y los derivados ergoloides en
el tratamiento de la enfermedad de alzheimer (ea).
fuentes de información: estudios, artículos de repaso, y editoriales
identificados a través de medline (1989–1997) y las bibliografías de
los artículos identificados.
selección de fuentes de información: se evaluaron los estudios y
artículos tratando de investigaciones farmacoterapeúticas con
antioxidantes, antihipertensivos, y derivados ergoloides.
método de extracción de información: la información pertinente fue
presentada en forma de un artículo de repaso.

síntesis: la ea es una condición neuropsiquiátrica progresiva cuya
etiología se desconoce. se discuten estudios evaluando la posible
asociación entre un mecanismo de radicales libres, el desarrollo de la
ea, y el papel potencial de los agentes antioxidantes. también se
discute el papel de los beta-bloqueadores, inhibidores de la eca,
 xxxd1728xxx , guanfacina, nimodipina, y derivados ergoloides en el
tratamiento de la ea.
conclusiones: evidencia preliminar sugiere que los agentes
antioxidantes poseen un efecto protector contra el desarrollo de la ea.
los beta-bloqueadores pueden ser útiles para controlar la agitación y
agresión en pacientes en quienes son inefectivos o contraindicados los
agentes anxiolíticos o antipsicóticos. otros agentes con un papel
potencial en el tratamiento de la ea incluyen los inhibidores de la eca,
la nimodipina, y los derivados ergoloides. la  xxxd1728xxx  y la guanfacina
han demostrado poca promesa en el mejoramiento de la función
cognitiva en la ea. son necesarios estudios prospectivos, controlados, y
doble-ciegos para determinar de manera definitiva el papel de todos
estos agentes en la prevención y tratamiento de la ea.

résumé
objectif:

revoir l’information portant sur l’utilisation d’anti-oxydants
dans la maladie d’alzheimer (ma) et discuter du rôle potentiel des bêtabloquants, des inhibiteurs de l’enzyme de conversion de l’angiotensine,
de la clonidine, de la guanfacine, de la  xxxd2728xxx , et des dérivés de
l’ergot dans la traitement de la ma.
revue de littérature: études, articles de revue, et éditoriaux identifiés
à partir d’une recherche informatisée de la banque de données
medline (1989–1997) et des références bibliographiques des articles
identifiés.
sélection des études: les études et les articles de revue portant sur les
anti-oxydants, les anti-hypertenseurs, et les dérivés l’ergot ont été
sélectionnés.
sélection de l’information: l’information pertinente a été
sélectionnée et mise sous un format permettant une révision synthétique.
résumé: la ma est un désordre neuropsychiatrique progressif
d’étiologie inconnue. les études évaluant la formation de radicaux libres
dans la pathogénèse et le rôle des anti-oxydants sont revus. de plus, le
rôle des bêta-bloquants, des inhibiteurs de l’enzyme de conversion de
l’angiotensine, de la clonidine, de la guanfacine, de la  xxxd2728xxx , et des
dérivés de l’ergot dans le traitement de la ma sont discutés.
conclusions: certaines évidences préliminaires suggèrent que les antioxydants pourraient avoir un effet protecteur contre le développement de
la ma. cependant, des études prospectives, en double-aveugle contre
placébo devront être faites pour confirmer leur rôle. néanmoins, la
compréhension du rôle des anti-oxydants permet de suggérer des
thérapies alternatives qui ont une activité pharmacologique similaire. par
exemple, les bêta-bloquants pourraient représenter une option pour
contrôler l’agitation lorsque les anxiolytiques et les antipsychotiques
sont innefficaces ou contre-indiqués. d’autres agents potentiels incluent
les inhibiteurs de l’enzyme de conversion de l’angiotensine, la
 xxxd2728xxx , et les dérivés de l’ergot. la clonidine et la guanfacine
semblent être des agents beaucoup moins prometteurs. ici encore, des
études bien contrôlées seront nécessaires pour mieux définir le rôle de
ces agents.
