 xxxd2420xxx .  the title compound, 11-chloro-8,12b-dihydro-2,8-dimethyl-12b-phenyl-4h-[1,3]oxazino[3,2-d][1,4]benzodiazepine-4,7(6h)-dione, c20h17cln2o3, is a benzodiazepine with an additional d-face-fused heterocyclic ring. in the molecule, a dihedral angle of 86.2 (1) degrees is formed by the planes of the phenyl and benzo rings and the former is axially oriented from the core, i.e. the fused 6,7,6-tricyclic system. both heterocycles in the core suffer significant deviations from planarity. the central diazepine ring is a twist-boat and the oxazine ring exhibits a conformation intermediate between half-chair and sofa.
