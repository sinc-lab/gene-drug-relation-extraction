abstract
the physiological reactions after spinal cord injury are accompanied by local synthesis of the transcriptional activator  xxxd3417xxx 
(ra). ra exerts its effects by binding to  xxxd3417xxx  receptors ( xxxg1931xxx ) which heterodimerize with retinoid x receptors (rxr) and then
act as ligand-activated transcription factors. to identify possible cellular targets of ra we investigated protein levels and cellular
distribution of retinoid receptors in the rat spinal cord at 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after a contusion injury. in the nonlesioned spinal cord,
immunoreactivity for  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx ,  xxxg1999xxx  and  xxxg2000xxx  was localized in the cytosol of neurons, that of  xxxg1998xxx  and  xxxg1999xxx  in astrocytes
and that of  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx  and  xxxg2000xxx  in some oligodendrocytes. after contusion injury  xxxg1931xxx  and all rxrs appeared in the cell nuclei
of reactive microglia and macrophages. this nuclear staining began at 4 days, was most prominent  xxxd2274xxx  and 14 days and had
decreased at 21 days after injury. a similar nuclear translocation was also observed for the  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx  and  xxxg1999xxx  staining in
neurons situated around the border of the contusion. these observations suggest that ra participates as a signal for the
physiological responses of microglia and neurons after cns injury.

introduction
after spinal cord injury (sci), microglia and macrophages clear debris
from degenerating cells and myelin and secrete a number of
inﬂammatory cytokines. due to these functions microglia have a
decisive inﬂuence on the medical outcome after sci (kiefer et al.,
2001; batchelor et al., 2004; gomes-leal et al., 2004; yang et al.,
2005), and it has been suggested that differences in the inﬂammatory
reaction between cns and pns are responsible for the different
growth-promoting properties of these environments (lazarov-spiegler
et al., 1998; slovodov et al., 2000; stoll et al., 2002). a recent study
implicates  xxxd3417xxx  (ra) in these events (mey et al., 2005). ra is
a transcriptional activator that binds to intracellular  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors ( xxxg1931xxx ), which in turn heterodimerize with retinoid x
receptors (rxr) and regulate gene expression via retinoic acidresponsive elements. there are three  xxxg1931xxx  and three rxr genes
( xxxg1931xxx , -b, -c and  xxxg1998xxx , -b, -c), each with different splice variants
(chambon, 1996). rxrs can also heterodimerize with a variety of
other related receptors including thyroid hormone receptors,  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx 
receptors and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors.
the putative relevance of the ra signaling system for cns injury
rests on three kinds of observations. (i) a subpopulation of
proliferating cells that express the proteoglycan  xxxg537xxx  as well as
retinaldehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg128xxx ) have been speciﬁcally
observed in the vicinity of a spinal cord contusion, and rasynthesizing activity by those enzymes increased locally after the
lesion (mey et al., 2005). (ii) corcoran et al. (2002a) found a strong
correlation between axonal regeneration and the expression of

rarb2: embryonic mouse spinal cord tissue extended neurites after
application of ra in vitro and this correlated with the expression of
rarb2, whereas tissue from adult mouse spinal cord did not
regenerate neurites and did not show an up-regulation of rarb2.
adult spinal cord tissue which was transfected to overexpress rarb2
showed proliﬁc neurite outgrowth in vitro (corcoran et al., 2002a).
(iii) in retinoid-deﬁcient adult rats, motoneurons showed an accumulation of intracellular neuroﬁlaments, an increase in astrocytosis, and
motoneuron degeneration. these effects have been ascribed to the
failed activation of  xxxg1931xxx  (corcoran et al., 2002b).
as these studies implicate a function of ra in the regulatory
processes of cns injury and neurodegenerative diseases, we asked
whether there was a role for ra signaling after sci. in order to address
this problem we performed spinal cord contusion injuries in adult rats,
measured protein levels of  xxxg1931xxx  and rxrs in the weeks after lesion
and investigated their cellular distribution with double-labelling
immunohistochemistry. because the intracellular localization of  xxxg1931xxx 
and rxr, which can be in either the cytosol or the nucleus, is an
indicator of transcriptional activity of ra (fukunaka et al., 2001; braun
et al., 2002a) this parameter was analysed with ﬂuorescence microscopy and quantiﬁed. special attention was paid to neurons because of
the neurotrophic effects of ra, and to microglia and macrophages
because anti-inﬂammatory activity has been ascribed to ra in different
contexts (dheen et al., 2005; sjöberg et al., 1992; kim et al., 2004).

contusions were performed with the new york university impactor
device. during the operation the rats breathed o2 and n2o, 1 : 2 ratio,
with varying concentrations of halothane during the procedure: 5% to
lose consciousness, 2% until analgesia and 1.5–1% thereafter. after
removing the covering muscle tissue, the spinal column was opened at
vertebrae t10 and t11 without rupturing the dura to expose the spinal
cord. the spinal column was ﬁxed with allis clamps in a stereotactic
frame at the spinous processes of t9 and t12 and raised to reduce
breathing motilities. to induce a mild lesion a weight of 10 g was
dropped from a height of 12.5 mm. the weight drop and displacement of
the tissue at impact were monitored to ensure reproducibility. experiments with velocity errors of > 5% were excluded from the analysis.
after the injury, vertebral bones which had been removed were replaced
with a resorbable gelatine sponge (spongostan; ferrosan, denmark) and
muscles and skin were sutured. postoperative care included analgesics
(0.1 mg ⁄ kg of 0.3 mg ⁄ ml temgesic; schering-plough) and 5–10 ml
daily of ringer’s lactate, both applied subcutaneously, and manual
emptying of the bladder until sufﬁcient voiding of the bladder returned.
sham-treated animals received a laminectomy only. locomotor recovery after spinal cord contusion injury was monitored using the locomotor
rating scale of basso, beattie and bresnahan (bbb; basso et al., 1995) to
verify that the severity of the injury was consistent in all animals. animal
experiments were performed in accordance with legal requirements for
animal experimentation, and were approved by the local authorities
(university of maastricht).

described above. rats were perfused with 4% pfa and a 10-mm piece
of lesioned spinal cord was removed and postﬁxed overnight, again in
4% pfa. for cryoprotection the tissue was equilibrated in 15% and
25% sucrose for 24 h each and then quick-frozen in isopentane. on a
cryostat, the spinal cord was sectioned parasagittally in 10-lm slices
and dry-mounted on ice-cold gelatine-coated slides. to avoid background staining, sections were blocked for 60 min with 3% normal
goat serum (sigma) and 1% triton x-100 (serva) for permeabilization. sections were incubated overnight at 4 c with combinations of
one primary antibody against a retinoid receptor and one antibody
used as a cell type marker. primary antibodies were directed against
 xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx ,  xxxg1999xxx  (diluted 1 : 100; santa cruz) and  xxxg2000xxx 
(1 : 75; santa cruz), all polyclonal, and monoclonal antibodies
against glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (gfap; 1 : 2000; sigma), 2¢,3¢cyclic neucleotide 3¢-phosphodiesterase (cnpase; 1 : 1000; sigma),
mitogen-activated protein2 ( xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx ; 1 : 500; sigma) and ed1
(1 : 600; serotec). secondary antibodies were alexa fluor488 goat
antirabbit (1 : 1000) and alexa fluor594 goat antimouse (1 : 500)
immunoglobulin-gs (mobitec, göttingen, germany). cell nuclei
were visualized with 4¢,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(dapi). sections were analysed with ﬂuorescence microscopy using a
zeiss axiophot microscope. again, preincubation with antigenic
peptide allowed testing for the speciﬁty of  xxxg1931xxx  staining in the tissue.

quantification of the intracellular localization of retinoid
receptors

western blotting
after survival periods of 4, 7, 14 and 21 days rats were killed by
decapitation. a 30-mm piece of spinal cord was removed and divided
into 10-mm sections central, rostral and caudal to the lesion. every
piece was triturated in 4 ll ⁄ mg of 20 mm hepes buffer with 1%
triton x-100 and protease inhibitors pmsf, 1 mm; leupeptin, 1 lm;
and aprotinin, 1%. after 20 min centrifugation at 13 000 g at 4 c the
content of soluble protein extracts was measured with the bicinchoninic
acid protein assay (sigma). proteins were separated with discontinuous
sds-page, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (mini transblot electrophoretic transfer cell; bio-rad) and stained with ponceaus. we used rabbit antisera binding speciﬁcally to the ra receptor
 xxxg1931xxx  (santa cruz; sc-551) or rxrs ( xxxg1998xxx , -b, -c; santa cruz;
sc-553, sc-831, sc-555), all diluted 1 : 500. to test the speciﬁty of the
 xxxg1931xxx  antiserum, it was blocked with  xxxg1931xxx  peptide (santa cruz,
sc-551p): this was diluted 1 : 50 and preincubated with  xxxg1931xxx 
antiserum 2 h before use. detection of immunoreactivity was based
on peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (sigma, dilution
1 : 5000), enhanced chemiluminiscence (amersham) and a digital
image analysis system ( xxxg1348xxx -labortechnik, wasserburg, germany).
when evaluating the western blots we used exposure times between
30 s and 30 min to determine the linear range of chemiluminiscence
output. for each time point three animals receiving an sci were
compared to three sham-operated animals. for statistics the immunoreactivity values after spinal cord contusion were normalized using the
averaged data from sham-operated animals with the same period of
survival. in the quantiﬁcation experiments, ponceau-s staining of all
proteins was used as control when comparing the strengths of speciﬁc
immunoreactive signals. logarithms of corrected data were analysed
with anova and post hoc dunnett’s test.
immunohistochemistry
for immunohistochemistry rats were killed using an overdose of
0.8 ml pentobarbital sodium after the same survival periods as

we evaluated the intracellular distribution of  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx ,  xxxg1999xxx 
and  xxxg2000xxx  in neurons, ed1-positive microglia or macrophages,
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in spinal cord sections from nonoperated and lesioned rats at 4, 7, 14 and 21 days post-operation
(d.p.o.). dapi-stained cells were identiﬁed by their morphology and
location in the spinal cord, and their identity was veriﬁed with
immunoreactivity for the markers mentioned above. a quantitative
assessment was made for neurons and activated microglia and
macrophages: for every double-labelling condition, three sections
separated by 100 lm were photographed (40· objective; zeiss
axiovision software), and 20 ed1- and  xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx -positive cells were
randomly selected within (macrophages) or close and ventral to
(motoneurons) the centre of the injury. the ﬂuorescence values of
staining for the retinoid receptor (alexa fluor488) of equal-sized
areas within the nucleus and within the cytoplasm were measured
with nih image software and the quotient was calculated for every
cell. the position of the cell nucleus was determined with dapi and
of the cell body with alexa fluor594 counterstaining (ed1,  xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx ).
dependence of the nuclear : cytosolic staining ratio on time after
injury was evaluated with anova.

results
behavioural effects of spinal cord contusion
all animals showed injury-induced deﬁcits and a normal pattern of
recovery according to the bbb score. in the ﬁrst postoperative days
only movement of the joints in the hind limbs was observed (3 d.p.o.,
bbb score 3.8 ± 1.6, mean ± sem). thereafter, the recovery proceeded normally and large differences between the animals were not
noted (21 d.p.o., bbb score 10.8 ± 0.3). the limited improvement in
function is part of the normal healing process, e.g. reduction of oedema,
but does not lead to functional recovery which would require axonal
regeneration.

retinoid receptors after spinal cord injury 287
 xxxg1931xxx  and all rxrs were present in the rat spinal cord
to address the question of whether  xxxg1931xxx  and rxrs are expressed in
the adult spinal cord, protein extracts from intact spinal cord were
analysed with western blotting. the results showed that all of these
retinoid receptors were present in the adult rat spinal cord (fig. 1a).
immunostaining for  xxxg1931xxx  showed bands of molecular weights of
105, 80 and 55 kda with one predominant band at 80 kda. preincubation of the antibody with  xxxg1931xxx  peptide abolished the
immunoreactive signals of all three molecular weight bands
(fig. 1b) and also of a speciﬁc signal in tissue sections (see below).
the immunoreactive bands of  xxxg1998xxx  and -c had a size of 40 kda and
that of  xxxg1999xxx  was 55 kda; these are consistent with those cited in the
literature (mohan et al., 2003; takiyama et al., 2004).  xxxg1932xxx  and
 xxxg1933xxx  were not investigated in this study.

sci caused a small reduction in the total amount of retinoid
receptors
if ra plays a role in lesion-induced processes after sci, one way of
regulating transcriptional activity might consist of changing protein
concentrations of its receptors, similar to what has been observed in
peripheral nerves (zhelyaznik & mey, 2005). for quantitative
assessment of the four retinoid receptor types expressed in the adult
spinal cord, we compared animals receiving an sci with shamoperated animals at time points of 4, 7, 14 and 21 d.p.o.. three rats
were used for every time point and type of injury. subsequently, a 30mm piece of spinal cord around the lesion site was dissected and
divided into three segments of equal size, central, rostral and caudal to
the lesion. semiquantitative analysis of western blots revealed a
moderate reduction in the total amount of  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx  and  xxxg1999xxx 
central and caudal to the lesion at 4, 7 and 14 d.p.o. (figs 1c and 2).
because the  xxxg1931xxx  antiserum speciﬁcally bound to three bands at 105,
80 and 55 kda, we evaluated changes in immunoreactivity of these
signals independently (fig. 2a–c). except for one signiﬁcant increase
in the 105-kda band (rostral, 7 d.p.o.) all signals displayed the same
tendencies for variation. at 21 d.p.o., the protein levels had returned
to baseline. in the rostral segment at 21 d.p.o., an increase in  xxxg1931xxx 
and  xxxg1999xxx  appeared.  xxxg2000xxx  was signiﬁcantly down-regulated only
21 days after injury in each of the three segments of the cord. these
changes may have occurred because of a down-regulation of retinoid
receptors within surviving cells or because of degeneration of rarand ⁄ or rxr-expressing cell types. we were able to resolve this issue
with immunohistochemical analysis.

cellular distribution of retinoid receptors in the adult spinal cord

fig. 1. retinoid receptor expression in the rat spinal cord. (a) western blot
data revealed the presence of  xxxg1931xxx  and all rxrs in the intact spinal cord.
immunostaining for  xxxg1931xxx  showed bands of molecular weights of 105, 80 and
55 kda with one predominant band at 80 kda. the immunoreactive bands of
 xxxg1998xxx  and -c had a size of 40 kda and  xxxg1999xxx  of 55 kda. (b) preincubation of
the  xxxg1931xxx  antiserum with  xxxg1931xxx  peptide abolished the staining of all three
immunoreactive bands in spinal cord extracts. (c) seven days after contusion
the total amount of  xxxg1931xxx  (aa),  xxxg1999xxx  (xb) and  xxxg2000xxx  (xc) was reduced after
spinal cord injury (sci) central and caudal to the lesion site compared to shamoperated animals (c, control).  xxxg1998xxx  (xa) protein level decreased in the rostral
and central parts of the lesion.

to identify cell types that express retinoid receptors in the spinal cord,
we investigated their distribution with immunohistochemistry in
parasagittal spinal cord sections of noninjured animals and 4, 7, 14
and 21 days after contusion injury. in the nonlesioned spinal cord
there was intense immunoreactivity of  xxxg1931xxx  in larger dendrites and
cytoplasm of  xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx -stained neurons (fig. 3a–c). this speciﬁc
immunohistochemical staining for  xxxg1931xxx  disappeared after preincubation of the antiserum with the  xxxg1931xxx  peptide (fig. 4). neurons were
also  xxxg1998xxx -positive; this was present in cytoplasm, nuclei and
dendrites.  xxxg2000xxx  occurred mainly in the cytoplasm. a slight
expression of  xxxg1999xxx  was seen in the cytoplasm of these neurons.
ramiﬁed astrocytes, stained with gfap, expressed  xxxg1999xxx  in their
cytoplasmatic processes (fig. 3d–f). these were intensely doublelabelled cells in the white matter and here predominantly at the border
to the grey matter. staining was stronger in the dorsal spinal cord.
astrocytes in the grey matter displayed a weaker  xxxg1999xxx  signal. white
matter gfap-positive astrocytes were weakly immunoreactive for
 xxxg1998xxx . this signal appeared in the cytoplasm close to the cell nuclei,
but no exclusively nuclear staining of retinoid receptors was observed
in astrocytes. some oligodendrocytes also expressed retinoid receptors. small, distinctly cnpase-positive cells in the white matter
showed  xxxg1931xxx -,  xxxg1998xxx - and  xxxg2000xxx - (fig. 3g–i) and a weak rxrbpositive staining in their cytosol.

nuclear localization of retinoid receptors in reactive microglia
and macrophages
neural injury causes a rapid transformation of highly ramiﬁed or
resting microglia to activated microglia with thick processes. cell
death leads to a further transformation into amoeboid or reactive
microglia, which lose their processes and become phagocytotic.

in the central part of the lesion at 4, 7 and 14 d.p.o.. at 21 d.p.o. the protein levels had returned to baseline or were even increased in the rostral segment. (f)  xxxg2000xxx 
was signiﬁcantly down-regulated only at 21 d.p.o. in each of the three segments of the cord (n ¼ 3 in all experiments; error bars indicate sem; *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01). bars are marked as follows: open, rostral; solid, central; shaded, caudal.

microglial activation is marked by proliferation, migration to the site
of injury, morphological changes and altered expression of cell surface
markers. spinal cord contusion also disrupts the blood–brain barrier,
thereby causing the inﬁltration of lymphocytes and haematogenous
macrophages into the tissue. the ed1 antibody used here recognizes a
single-chain glycoprotein of 110 kda which is expressed predomin-

antly in the lysosomal compartment of activated microglia and
macrophages, and it is absent in the normal adult rodent cns (dijkstra
et al., 1985; streit et al., 1989; perry et al., 1993). at all time points
after injury, ed1-positive activated and reactive microglia were seen
in the spinal cord sections. activated microglia were distributed
peripheral to the lesion site (fig. 5a), and amoeboid reactive microglia

and macrophages were close to and within the centre of the lesion
(fig. 5b–d). four days after injury a weak signal of  xxxg1931xxx 
immunoreactivity was seen in the nuclei and cytoplasm of these
ed1-positive reactive monocytes within the lesion site (fig. 5e). three
days later,  xxxd2274xxx  d.p.o., a strong signal was present in the nuclei while
the cytosolic staining was attenuated (fig. 5f). at 14 d.p.o. the nuclear
staining had become even more intense (fig. 5g). one week later, at
21 d.p.o., it had decreased to a low level (fig. 5h). in contrast,  xxxg1998xxx 
and  xxxg1999xxx  were found predominantly in the cytoplasm of reactive
microglia and macrophages at 4 d.p.o. (fig. 5i and m), where the rxr

staining did not distinguish cell nuclei from the surrounding
cytoplasm. after 7 (fig. 5j and n) and 14 d.p.o. (fig. 5k and o) the
receptors had shifted almost completely into the nucleus. subsequently,  xxxg1998xxx  and -b proteins appeared to have returned to their
initial distribution because at 21 d.p.o. the signals were again seen in
the cytoplasm (fig. 5l and p). immunoreactivity to  xxxg2000xxx  was present

here, observations and quantitative measurements were performed on cells after immunohistochemical double labelling of one retinoid receptor and ed1, combined
with dapi staining. (e–h) the nuclear signal of  xxxg1931xxx  was up-regulated between (e) 4 d.p.o. and (f) 7 d.p.o., (g) was increased further at 14 d.p.o. and
(h) reduced 7 days later. (i–l)  xxxg1998xxx  staining at (i) 4 d.p.o. was found predominantly in the cytoplasm. after (j) 7 d.p.o. and (k) 14 d.p.o. it had shifted almost
completely into the nucleus. (l) at 21 d.p.o. the label had returned to the cytoplasm. (m–p) the receptor distribution of  xxxg1999xxx  resembled that of  xxxg1998xxx . (q–t)
staining of  xxxg2000xxx  was (q) cytosolic at 4 d.p.o., also increased in the nucleus at (r) 7 d.p.o. and (s) 14 d.p.o., but was less intense than that of  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx  or

21 d.p.o. (fig. 5t). figure 7a presents a quantiﬁcation of these
observations: at 4 d.p.o. the nuclear and cytosolic signals of all four
receptors were about equal. a translocation of  xxxg1931xxx  into the nuclei of
macrophages caused the ratio of nuclear : cytosolic staining to
increase. this ratio reached 2–3  xxxd2274xxx  and 14 d.p.o., then it declined

to  1.4 at 21 d.p.o.. similar, albeit less dramatic, changes were
apparent for the rxrs. in summary, all expressed retinoid receptors
showed a shift from a cytoplasmic to a nuclear localization 7–14 d.p.o.
and a subsequent decline in the nuclear immunoreactivity (see also
fig. 8). these observations, which pertain to ed1-positive cells within

retinoid receptor expression in neurons
acute injury to the nervous system triggers a number of morphologic
and metabolic changes in the directly affected neurons. injured nerve
cells that survive the initial damage rapidly stimulate the activation of
nearby microglia and astrocytes and frequently undergo apoptosis
(raivich et al., 1999). staining for  xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx , which marks neuronal
somata and dendrites, showed the complete absence of viable neurons
within the lesion site even after mild contusion injury. our investigation of the neuronal localization of retinoid receptors in neurons
therefore focused on cells in the ventral spinal cord adjacent to the

centre of the injury. at 4 d.p.o. there was strong  xxxg1931xxx  immunoreactivity predominantly in the cytoplasm and bigger dendrites of
neurons positive for  xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx  rostral and distal to the lesion site (fig. 6a
and b). three days later,  xxxd2274xxx  d.p.o., this signal also appeared within
some cell nuclei (fig. 6c and d). at 14 d.p.o.  xxxg1931xxx  had shifted
almost completely into the nuclei (fig. 6e and f) while after 21 d.p.o.
it was again located predominantly in the cytoplasm and bigger
dendrites (fig. 6g and h). an  xxxg1998xxx  signal was present in the
cytoplasm, in bigger and smaller dendrites and to a lesser extent in
neuronal nuclei, at 4 d.p.o.. dendrites were stained more strongly with
the antibody against  xxxg1998xxx  than that against  xxxg1931xxx .  xxxd2274xxx  d.p.o. the
dendritic staining had decreased and it was almost gone at 14 d.p.o.. in
contrast, the nuclear staining increased during this time. at 21 d.p.o.
the  xxxg1998xxx  signal was weak and mostly cytoplasmatic. the neuronal

fig. 7. quantitative analysis of the intracellular receptor distribution in

the nucleus, with a peak at 14 d.p.o. for  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1999xxx  and  xxxg2000xxx  and at
7 d.p.o. for  xxxg1998xxx . this intracellular translocation was most prominent for
 xxxg1931xxx  where the ratio of nuclear to cytosolic signal rose from 1.1 to 2.7.
changes were signiﬁcant for  xxxg1931xxx  and all rxrs (anova, p < 0.0001).
(b) in neurons,  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx  and  xxxg1999xxx  signals shifted to the nucleus with a
maximum at 14 d.p.o. (anova, p < 0.0001). again,  xxxg1931xxx  showed the
strongest nuclear : cytosolic signal ratio. the intracellular distribution of  xxxg2000xxx 
changed very little. error bars indicate sem; n ¼ 20 cells in all cases.

staining of  xxxg1999xxx  was in general rather faint; it decreased with time
and changed from predominantly cytosolic with no distinct dendritic
staining at 4 d.p.o. to a more nuclear location  xxxd2274xxx  and 14 d.p.o., and
then was again mostly cytosolic. the intracellular distribution of
 xxxg2000xxx  changed less than was observed for the other receptors
(fig. 7b). the intensity of staining, indicative of the overall amount of
receptor protein, was decreased at 4 and 7 d.p.o. and had recovered
again at 14 and 21 d.p.o.. in comparison with macrophages, the
intracelluar distribution of retinoid receptors in neurons always
displayed a stronger cytoplasmatic signal. however, a transient shift
of all detected retinoid receptors towards the nucleus did occur
(anova, p < 0.0001 for  xxxg1931xxx  and all rxrs). this lesion-induced
change was most pronounced  xxxd2274xxx  d.p.o.. for the quantiﬁcation of
these observations we selected  xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx -positive motoneurons, identiﬁed by their size, morphology and location in the ventral horn. while
it is possible that the changed retinoid distribution is part of
physiological changes that may be detrimental or supportive to the

in the noninjured spinal cord, gfap-positive astrocytes with thin
processes were evenly distributed over grey and white matter. four
days after injury there were no astrocytes left within the lesion site,
and adjacent astrocytes had a changed morphology with swollen
somata and much shorter processes. as gfap staining was strongly
increased, an astrocytic scar formed around the lesion site. while this
phenomenon seemed to be in progress after 4 d.p.o., 3 days later
(7 d.p.o.) the number of astrocytes had increased in the whole tissue
and a delimited scar made of a thin layer of swollen astrocytes
surrounded the lesion. during the following 2 weeks the astrocytic
scar grew in size.
while in nonoperated animals and at 4 d.p.o. in sci animals  xxxg1931xxx 
was was not present in astroglia, this receptor was up-regulated in
some astrocytes of animals that survived 7 days after injury. the
receptor protein was discernible in nuclei and cytoplasm, but not in the
ramiﬁcations of astrocytes in grey or white matter.  xxxg1998xxx , in contrast,
exhibited a weak staining at all the time points after injury that we
looked at. it was present in the cytoplasm of swollen astrocytes close
to the lesion site, and the intensity of the staining improved with the
swelling of the cell bodies.  xxxd2274xxx  d.p.o. the nuclei of some of these cells
were also stained. two weeks after injury many ramiﬁed astrocytes in
grey and white matter and at the site of injury showed a strong  xxxg1998xxx 
label. immunostaining in these cells was reduced at 21 d.p.o.. a bright
 xxxg1999xxx  signal was already visible in many but not all astrocytes of the
nonoperated spinal cord. the number of  xxxg1999xxx -positive astrocytes
increased with time, especially close to the lesion site. most rxrbmarked cells were seen at 21 d.p.o. (fig. 6i–p). no intracellular shift
towards a nuclear localization was apparent. compared to the controls,
 xxxg2000xxx  was up-regulated at 4 d.p.o. in the cytoplasm of astrocytes in
the white matter and around the lesion site, and after 7 d.p.o. the
receptor was also seen in the nuclei. at 14 d.p.o.,  xxxg2000xxx  was found in
astrocytes in the grey matter adjacent to the lesion site. at 21 d.p.o.
the  xxxg2000xxx  signal had again decreased. our observations of retinoid
receptor expression in gfap-positive astrocytes are summarized in
fig. 8.

retinoid receptor distribution in oligodendrocytes
in the intact spinal cord, cnpase staining of grey and white matter was
used to mark oligodendrocytes and their processes. the pattern of
staining did not change much at 4 d.p.o..  xxxd2274xxx  and 14 d.p.o. the
cnpase staining was more intense and the structural differences
between grey- and white-matter myelin were better distinguishable. at
4 d.p.o. a lot of myelin debris, distributed throughout the entire lesion
site, was already partially phagocytosed by microglia. after 21 d.p.o.
this remaining cnpase staining was again weaker and the lesion site
was almost cleared of myelin debris.
all analysed retinoid receptors were coexpressed with cnpase in a
pattern that resembled that of myelin. the signal of all retinoid
receptors increased over time,  xxxd2274xxx  and 14 d.p.o., and had declined at
21 d.p.o.. cnpase-immunoreactive structures that also carried  xxxg1931xxx ,
 xxxg1998xxx  and  xxxg2000xxx  occurred in linear fascicles in the white matter, yet

discussion
in this study we report that spinal cord contusion injury in the adult rat
causes an intracellular translocation of retinoid receptors  xxxg1931xxx ,
 xxxg1998xxx ,  xxxg1999xxx  and  xxxg2000xxx  in macrophages and neurons. the time
course of these changes, predominantly 7–14 days after injury,
suggests an involvement of ra signaling in late inﬂammatory
processes. retinoid receptors were also expressed in astroglia and
oligodendrocytes, and the staining patterns in these cells were
similarly affected by the injury.
our western blotting results showed that  xxxg1931xxx  and all rxr
isoforms were also present in the nonlesioned spinal cord. quantitative
assessment of the retinoid receptor proteins at 4, 7, 14 and 21 d.p.o.
showed a moderate reduction in the total amount of  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx  and
 xxxg1999xxx  central and caudal to the lesion at 4, 7 and 14 d.p.o.. at
21 d.p.o. the protein levels had returned to baseline.  xxxg2000xxx  was
signiﬁcantly reduced only at 21 d.p.o. in each of the three segments of
the cord.

of  xxxg1931xxx - and ⁄ or rxr-expressing cell types and not to the downregulaion of  xxxg1931xxx  or rxrs in surviving cells. neurons and
oligodendrocytes expressed all four retinoid receptor types in the
uninjured spinal cord and at all measured time points after injury. the
loss of neurons at the site of the lesion explains the reductions in
 xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1998xxx  and  xxxg1999xxx  in the tissue samples taken from the lesion
site, and the spreading apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes probably
expalins that in the caudal segment. although  xxxg1360xxx   xxxg1400xxx -positive
motoneurons that expressed retinoid receptors in their nuclei did not
show cytological signs of cell death, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the receptor translocation forms an early part of a cell death
pathway. whatever the function, neurons appear to be targets of
retinoid signaling after sci.
the compensating increase in all retinoid receptors at later time
points might be due to the up-regulation in reactive microglia, which
strongly proliferated and invaded the lesion cavity in great numbers.
we conclude from these observations that macrophages are also
targets of ra signaling. this interpretation is also in accordance with
recent experiments by dheen et al. (2005), who demonstrated antiinﬂammatory effects of brain microglia primary cultures activated
with lipopolysaccharide or b-amyloid peptide.

intracellular translocation of retinoid receptors
cellular targets of ra signaling after spinal cord contusion
immunohistochemical assessment revealed that the reduction in the
total amount of retinoid receptor protein was due to the degeneration

transcription. retinoid receptors are thought to reside exclusively in
the cell nucleus (chambon, 1996; braun et al., 2002a). in contrast we
found that, in the noninjured spinal cord, retinoid receptors were
located in the cytoplasm of neurons and glia cells. we saw a transfer of
 xxxg1931xxx  and rxrs to the cell nuclei only after contusion injury. while
this constitutes a contradiction of the original concept, other instances
of cytosolic distribution of retinoid receptors have recently been
reported, e.g. in sertoli cells (braun et al., 2002a,b). cañón et al.
(2004) report nongenomic effects of ra-like creb and erk
phosphorylation in pc12 cells; these effects might reside in the
cytosol.
the injury-induced subcellular translocation of retinoid receptors
may either be a consequence of ra exposure or may represent an raindependent regulatory mechanism that renders these cells responsive
to ra. is ra the trigger of subcellular translocation? it was recently
reported that sci, performed as in the present study, resulted in an
increase in local enzyme activity of  xxxg128xxx , presumably leading to
local synthesis of all-trans ra. in accordance with the intracellular
shift or  xxxg1931xxx , the strongest increase in  xxxg128xxx  activity occurred 7–
14 d.p.o. (mey et al., 2005). because rxrs can be heterodimeric
partners of other nuclear receptors ( xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  receptors, thyroid
hormone receptors and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors;
chambon, 1996) their translocation may also be caused by transcriptional activators other than ra, i.e. the ligands of these receptors.
thyroid hormone, for instance, may be involved in the responses to
nerve injury (barakat-walter, 1999). in another context, thyroid
 xxxg1603xxx -b was found to be partially in the cytoplasm and
transferred to the nucleus upon triiodothyronin binding (zhu et al.,
1998). co-transfected rxr markedly decreased the rapid shuttling of
thyroid  xxxg1603xxx -b between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in hela cells by maintaining them unliganded within the
nucleus (baumann et al., 2001). furthermore, rars exhibited
reduced shuttling in the presence of rxrs, suggesting that heterodimerization plays a major role in maintaining the normal cellular
distribution of rars (prüfer et al., 2000; maruvada et al., 2003).
alternatively, are other factors responsible for a nuclear shift of
 xxxg1931xxx  and rxrs? injury-related factors that are not ligands of the
nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  superfamily may cause the intracellular
shift of  xxxg1931xxx  or rxr proteins. in the liver, pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines, e.g. interleukin-1b, inﬂuence the subcellular localization
and dna binding of  xxxg1931xxx – xxxg1999xxx  heterodimers (denson et al.,
2000; ghose et al., 2004). in the spinal cord, cytokines that lead to a
transfer of retinoid receptors into the nucleus could thereby induce
the responsivity of the affected cells to ra. the dna binding
domains of rars, rxrs and other hormone receptors can serve as
nuclear export signals (black et al., 2001), and it has also been
shown that the dna binding domain of rxrs contains a nuclear
localization sequence and mediates binding to import receptors
(prüfer & barsony, 2002).
comparison with peripheral nerve injury
a number of similarities and differences are observed with respect to
ra signaling after injury in the central and peripheral nervous system.
in both cases, ra synthesis was catalysed by  xxxg128xxx  ( xxxg127xxx 
and -3 were not involved), and a small increase in immunoreactivity or
enzyme activity of  xxxg128xxx  was seen, which was stronger after
spinal cord contusion (mey et al., 2005) than after sciatic nerve injury
(zhelyaznik et al., 2003).  xxxg1931xxx  and all rxrs were also expressed in
the sciatic nerve. after peripheral nerve lesion, nuclear translocation of
 xxxg1931xxx  and  xxxg1998xxx  in macrophages and schwann cells was also visible
and, as in the spinal cord, this activity appeared much later than the

initial inﬂammatory response (n. zhelyaznik and j. mey, 2005 and
unpublished observations).
unlike in the sciatic nerve, we saw no increase in the expression
levels of retinoid receptors in the cns (zhelyaznik & mey, 2005).
sources of ra synthesis in the spinal cord were oligodendrocytes,
meningeal cells and, after injury, ng-2-expressing cells, which
proliferate and are thought to differentiate mostly into oligodendrocytes (mey et al., 2005). in the pns the ra-releasing cells have not
yet been identiﬁed, although  xxxg128xxx  staining suggests schwann
cells to be likely candidates.
possible physiological functions of ra after sci
the time course of retinoid signaling suggests that ra probably does
not initiate the inﬂammatory reaction or axonal sprouting because
these changes occur earlier. based on receptor expression in target
cells it is tempting to conclude that ra may fulﬁl neuroprotective or
neuritogenic functions. this has already been shown in vitro in
different contexts, including mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons
(corcoran & maden, 1999; corcoran et al., 2000), embryonic spinal
cord of humans and mice (quinn & de boni, 1991), and chick retinal
ganglion cells (mey & rombach, 1999). as noted above, an
involvement in a neuronal cell death pathway cannot be excluded,
because apoptotic functions of ra also exist.
in astrocytes, ra might suppress the astroglial inﬂammatory
response. for instance, it has recently been discovered that ra inhibits
interferon-c-activated janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of
transcription (jak–stat) pathways, probably via the expression of
suppressors of cytokine signaling (socs3) (choi et al., 2005). in
addition to degeneration of their motoneurons, retinoid-deﬁcient rats
show an increase in astrocytosis; this was found to be a consequence
of the lack of  xxxg1931xxx  (corcoran et al., 2002b). furthermore, it has been
suggested that astrocytes regulate the concentration of ra through
oxidation of retinol to the biologically active ra, which then gives
trophic support to spinal cord neurons in vitro (wuarin et al., 1990).
in macrophages, which were found to be major targets of ra
signaling after sci, potent anti-inﬂammatory effects of ra have also
been reported. in peritoneal macrophages, ra almost completely
inhibited the production of  xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxd2738xxx 
(sjöberg et al., 1992), the lipopolysaccharid-induced production of
 xxxd1903xxx  and the expression of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2)
protein, which take part in pro-inﬂammatory reactions as well (kim
et al., 2004). in activated rat microglia the ra-induced reduction
in  xxxg2296xxx -a and  xxxd2738xxx  synthase was correlated
with enhanced expression of  xxxg1932xxx  and transforming growth factor
(tgf-b1) and inhibited translocation of nuclear factor-jb (dheen
et al., 2005).
in summary, our experiments reveal that the ra signaling system
participates in the physiological responses to sci: they indicate that
activated microglia in their phagocytotic stage are targets of this
signaling pathway. in addition, neurons, scar-forming astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes express retinoid receptors. the intracellular distributions of several of these receptors show a translocation, from the
cytosol into the nucleus, which is triggered by a contusion injury. ra
signaling may thus provide a novel target for therapeutic interventions
in inﬂammatory processes in the cns.
