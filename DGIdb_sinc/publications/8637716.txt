the human  xxxg1162xxx  receptor requires gp130 for signalling: demonstration by molecular cloning of the receptor.  we describe the molecular cloning of a cdna for the alpha chain of the human  xxxg1162xxx  receptor (il-11r alpha) and demonstrate the requirement of either the human or mouse gp130 molecule for signalling. cdna clones encoding il-11r alpha were isolated from a bone marrow cdna library using a fragment from the murine il-11r alpha as a probe. the human receptor was predicted to consist of 422 amino acids and was found to share 84% identity with the murine protein. in the extra-cellular region it exhibited a single hemopoietin domain with conserved cysteine residues and wstws motif. the transmembrane region was followed by a short cytoplasmic tail which did not contain a  xxxg2198xxx  domain. interaction of the human il-11r alpha with murine gp130 was demonstrated: expression of the human il-11r alpha in murine m1 cells which constitutively express murine gp130 (and murine lif receptor), resulted in the generation of specific high-affinity binding sites for  xxxg1162xxx  (kd = 250 pm). in addition, expression of the human il-11r alpha in these cells permitted the induction of macrophage differentiation in response to  xxxg1162xxx . these results suggested that the human il-11r alpha chain was able to form a functional receptor complex in association with murine gp130. the requirement of gp130 for signalling was confirmed by expression of the human il-11r alpha in ba/f3 cells. baf3 cells that expressed the human il-11r alpha alone showed binding of radiolabelled  xxxg1162xxx  but no proliferative response. introduction of human gp130 into these cells resulted in high-affinity  xxxg1162xxx  binding sites and  xxxg1162xxx  dependent cellular proliferation. thus these results demonstrated the absolute requirement of gp130 for signalling.
