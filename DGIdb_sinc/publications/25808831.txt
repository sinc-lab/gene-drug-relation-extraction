1 introduction
 xxxd2107xxx  is a ph-activated fluoroquinolone (belonging
to a new 8-cyano subclass) that is being developed by
merlion pharmaceuticals to treat serious bacterial infections associated with an acidic environment, including
urinary tract infections (utis) and helicobacter pylori
infections [1, 2]. the compound exhibits optimal efficacy
in slightly acidic environments (ph 5.0–6.0), under which
other fluoroquinolones lose activity. it is highly selective
for bacterial type ii topoisomerases, including  xxxg2311xxx 
and dna topoisomerase iv.
a topical otic suspension formulation of  xxxd2107xxx 
(xtorotm), developed by alcon (a division of novartis),
was recently approved in the usa for the treatment of acute
otitis externa (in individuals aged c1 year) caused by susceptible strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and a common technical document for this
indication was also filed in canada [3]. phase ii development of oral and intravenous (iv) formulations for the
treatment of complicated uti and pyelonephritis are underway in germany and poland, as well as an oral formulation for the treatment of uncomplicated uti in germany
and singapore. phase ii development of oral  xxxd2107xxx  as
part of a combination regimen is also underway in germany
to treat h. pylori infection. phase i studies have been conducted in switzerland, the uk and us, with particular
emphasis on safety, as well as the pharmacokinetics and
bactericidal activity in urine and lung tissue.

 xxxd2107xxx  was originally developed by bayer
healthcare pharmaceuticals (formerly bayer schering
pharma), which subsequently out-licensed global development rights to byk gulden (later altana pharma).
however, altana terminated developmental work on  xxxd2107xxx  and licence rights were returned to bayer
healthcare pharmaceuticals, which out-licensed  xxxd2107xxx  development rights to merlion pharma.

2.1.2 in vitro activity
clsi or eucast breakpoints for susceptibility for  xxxd2107xxx  have not been defined as yet. the antimicrobial
activity of  xxxd2107xxx  is enhanced in acidic conditions
compared with a neutral environment [6–18]. the antibacterial activity of  xxxd2107xxx  was optimal between
ph 5.0 and 6.0 against a broad spectrum of gram-positive
and gram-negative laboratory strains, including
ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, using broth microdilution
methods [13]. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)
values were 4- to 8-fold lower at ph 5–6 than at neutral
ph.

chemical structure of  xxxd2107xxx 

 xxxd2107xxx : first global approval

compared with other fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) using disk diffusion methods,  xxxd2107xxx  demonstrated greater activity in acidic
conditions (ph 5.8) against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)
strains and coagulase-negative staphylococcal strain pairs
consisting of small colony variants and their clonally
identical parental strain displaying the normal phenotype
[8]. at neutral conditions, activity against mssa isolates
was greatest with moxifloxacin, followed by  xxxd2107xxx ,
levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin.
 xxxd2107xxx  mic values were twofold lower than those
of ciprofloxacin against mssa strains and were generally
similar (0.125–1 lg/ml) to those of ciprofloxacin against
community-acquired mrsa isolates in broth microdilution
assays [12]. against listeria monocytogenes, the mic
values of  xxxd2107xxx  and ciprofloxacin were generally
similar (1–2 lg/ml). in acidic conditions, the mic values
of  xxxd2107xxx  decreased, whereas the mic values of
ciprofloxacin increased, for both s. aureus and l. monocytogenes strains.
against s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis strains in
synthetic urine (ph 5.8),  xxxd2107xxx  mics were 4- to
32-fold lower than those of ciprofloxacin [9].
against a range of enterobacteriaceae,  xxxd2107xxx  mic
values were 4- to 16-fold lower under acidic conditions
than under neutral conditions in broth microdilution assays
[13].  xxxd2107xxx  mic values at which 50 % (mic50) and
90 % (mic90) of the isolates were inhibited against
ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant escherichia coli
strains are presented in the in vitro activity table.
in broth microdilution assays, the mic values for  xxxd2107xxx  against fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli isolates
(both wild-type and isogenic mutant strains) were lower in
an acidic than a neutral environment by a factor of 2–8 [6].
in contrast, mic values for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and
moxifloxacin were higher in an acidic than neutral environment by factors of 8–16, 8 and 4–16, respectively. at a
ph of 5.8,  xxxd2107xxx  mic values against a range of
chromosomally- or plasmid-encoded fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli strains were 2- to 16-fold lower than those of
other fluoroquinolones tested. unlike the other fluoroquinolones (particularly ciprofloxacin), which showed reduced in vitro activity,  xxxd2107xxx  mic values were
unaffected by the presence of qepa1 gene mutation and, at
ph 5.8,  xxxd2107xxx  mic values were b2 lg/ml, except
against strains with the qnrs variant [6].
in neutral conditions,  xxxd2107xxx  mic50 and mic90
values (16 lg/ml for both) were generally similar to those
of ciprofloxacin (8 and 16 lg/ml, respectively) against
ciprofloxacin-sensitive and -resistant acinetobacter baumannii isolates in disk diffusion assays [10]. however, in

acidic conditions,  xxxd2107xxx  mic50 and mic90 values
decreased to 2 lg/ml against both strains, and
ciprofloxacin mic50 and mic90 values increased to 16 and
[128 lg/ml, respectively.
against bacteroides fragilis strains,  xxxd2107xxx  mic50
and mic90 values were 0.5 and 4.0 lg/ml in neutral
conditions and were reduced to 0.25 and 4 lg/ml in acidic
conditions in broth microdilution assays [7].
against legionella pneumophila laboratory strains, the
mic values of  xxxd2107xxx  and ciprofloxacin were generally similar (0.01 lg/ml) using broth microdilution
methods [12].
 xxxd2107xxx  mic values in acidic conditions (ph 5.0)
were lower than those observed at ph 7.4 against h. pylori
strains using disk diffusion assays, and lower than those of
ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin [18].
similarly, against yersinia pestis strains,  xxxd2107xxx 
mic values were lower at ph 6 than at ph 7 in broth
microdilution assays [15]. in contrast, mic values for
ciprofloxacin increased when the ph was lowered compared with those at neutral conditions.
2.1.3 bactericidal and post-antibiotic effect
at 4 times the mic,  xxxd2107xxx  was rapidly bactericidal
against burkholderia pseudomallei at ph 5.0 and at ph 7.0,
with the activity greatest at ph 5 [17]. in a murine inhalational model of melioidosis, the bacterial burden in
animals infected with b. pseudomallei, was lower 24 h post
challenge in  xxxd2107xxx -treated animals than in those
treated with ciprofloxacin or  xxxd1734xxx  (p \ 0.05)
[17].
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd2107xxx  demonstrated bactericidal effects against susceptible urinary pathogens, with
bactericidal activity enhanced in acidic versus alkaline
urine [14]. in acidic conditions,  xxxd2107xxx  was more
active than ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin by a factor of
4–64 against strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and
e. faecalis; the difference in activity against proteus
mirabilis and p. aeruginosa strains was within a factor of
2.
compared with other fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin and moxifloxacin),  xxxd2107xxx  demonstrated
a longer post-antibacterial effect (pae) against strains of s.
aureus, p. aeruginosa and e. coli under acidic conditions,
whereas at neutral conditions, the pae of all agents tested
was generally similar [11].
2.1.4 biofilm activity
 xxxd2107xxx  demonstrated greater bactericidal activity than
ciprofloxacin against catheter adherent (biofilm) e. coli and

k. mckeage

mutations in the chromosomal dna that encode for dna
gyrase and dna topoisomerase enzymes, decreased outer
membrane permeability or drug efflux mechanisms.
resistance to  xxxd2107xxx  appears less likely in acidic
conditions than in a neutral environment [16]. at a ph of
5.8, only 12 % of 100 mrsa isolates were resistant to
 xxxd2107xxx  (23 % at ph 7.2), whereas more than 60 %
were resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin irrespective of ph. about 70 % of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermis strains tested (n = 50) were resistant to
ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, whereas only 8 % were
resistant to  xxxd2107xxx  at an acidic ph (34 % at ph 7.2)
[16]. at ph 5.8, 99 % of ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci were also resistant to moxifloxacin, but only 21 %
were resistant to  xxxd2107xxx  (47.4 % at ph 7.2).

greater bactericidal activity than ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin
or moxifloxacin against filter membrane-adherent e. coli
[19]. in the latter experiment,  xxxd2107xxx  was the only drug
to prevent the regrowth of the adherent population following
perfusion with drug-free media. furthermore, following
exposure to stationary-phase e. coli for 24 h,  xxxd2107xxx 
achieved a greater killing rate (as determined from survival
rates) than ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin.
2.1.5 resistance
breakpoints for resistance for  xxxd2107xxx  have not yet
been defined. in vitro, resistance to  xxxd2107xxx  as a result
of spontaneous mutation is rare [5]. the primary
mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones is via

in vitro activity of  xxxd2107xxx  against selected laboratory isolates in neutral and acidic conditions using broth microdilution assays [13]

2.2 pharmacokinetics
following a single dose of  xxxd2107xxx  otic suspension
0.3 % (4 or 8 drops in each ear) in patients with acute otitis
media (n = 36), quantifiable  xxxd2107xxx  concentrations of
up to 0.234 ng/ml were observed in two patients [5].
similarly, following repeated ototopical doses of  xxxd2107xxx  (4 drops in each ear twice daily) for 7 days in
healthy volunteers (n = 14), quantifiable  xxxd2107xxx 
concentrations of 0.05 ng/ml (i.e. just above the quantifiable limit) were observed in two subjects [5].
 xxxd2107xxx  is well absorbed after oral administration,
with generally similar mean peak plasma concentration
(cmax) values to those of other fluoroquinolones [20].
following oral doses of  xxxd2107xxx  300, 600 or 800 mg
once daily for 7 consecutive days in healthy volunteers,
mean cmax values were 4.15, 6.76 and 8.95 mg/l, respectively, which were achieved at 0.63, 0.88 and 0.88 h
(median values) [20]. in corresponding dosage groups,
mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from
time zero to 24 h (auc24) values were 9.09, 19.2 and
26.1 mgh/l, with mean terminal elimination half-life
values of 6.5, 8.8 and 14.0 h. approximately one-third of
the oral dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, and
renal elimination appeared to be saturable, with dosages
[400 mg leading to slight increases in the dose-normalized auc extrapolated to infinity [20].
in urine,  xxxd2107xxx  was bactericidal against susceptible uropathogens in a study in healthy volunteers [14]. the
mean cmax of  xxxd2107xxx  in urine was 150 lg/ml 4–8 h
after a single oral dose of  xxxd2107xxx  800 mg.
after iv administration of single doses of  xxxd2107xxx 
800 and 1000 mg in healthy volunteers, mean cmax values
were 13.7 and 21.0 lg/ml, respectively, and mean auc
from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration values were 32.3 and 48.1 lgh/ml [21]. following
once-daily iv  xxxd2107xxx  800 or 1000 mg for 7 consecutive days, cmax was 11.9 and 18.9 lg/ml, respectively, and auc24 was 37.1 and 67.8 lgh/ml. systemic
exposure to iv  xxxd2107xxx  increased in a dose-dependent
manner [21].
2.3 therapeutic trials
2.3.1 otitis externa
 xxxd2107xxx  administered twice daily (4 drops each time)
for 7 days was superior to vehicle with regard to

microbiological and clinical outcomes, including time to
cessation of ear pain, in two randomized, multicentre
phase iii trials in patients (aged 6 months to 85 years)
with otitis externa [5, 22]. the primary endpoint was the
proportion of patients with a clinical cure (i.e. eradication of tenderness, erythema and oedema) on day 11
[22].
in pathogen-positive patients (baseline specimen contained s. aureus and/or p. aeruginosa), a clinical cure on
day 11 in  xxxd2107xxx  and vehicle groups was evident in
71.7 versus 33.3 % of patients in study 1 (n = 283), and
68.7 versus 40.0 % in study 2 (n = 277) [p \ 0.0001 for
both] [5, 22]. in the intent-to-treat population, clinical
cure rates on day 11 were evident in 71.2 versus 50.6 %
of patients, respectively, in study 1 (n = 686) and 70.8
versus 48.9 %, in study 2 (n = 548) [p \ 0.0001 for
both] [5, 22].
across both trials, the median time to the cessation of
ear pain in groups receiving  xxxd2107xxx  or vehicle was 3.5
versus 6.8 days in pathogen-positive patients and 3.5 versus 5.3 days in the itt population [5]. microbiological
success (i.e. eradication of all baseline organisms) in
pathogen-positive patients was achieved in 67 versus 13 %
of patients, respectively. in clinically cured pathogenpositive patients, eradication rates of s. aureus and p.
aeruginosa were 89 % for both in the  xxxd2107xxx  group
compared with 33 and 20 %, respectively, in the vehicle
group [5].

2.3.2 urinary tract infections
preliminary results of a phase ii trial in hospitalized patients (n = 193) with complicated uti (cuti; 70 % with
pyelonephritis) indicate that  xxxd2107xxx  is superior to
current standard care (results reported in a media release)
[23]. once-daily  xxxd2107xxx  800 mg (iv and oral) for 5
or 10 days was associated with higher, more rapid and
more sustained levels of microbiological eradication, as
well as improved clinical outcomes than patients treated
with twice-daily ciprofloxacin 400 mg for 10 days [23,
24]. at test of cure evaluation (17 days after the start of
therapy), a composite response (primary endpoint; both
microbiological eradication and elimination of clinical
symptoms) in groups receiving  xxxd2107xxx  for 5 or
10 days, or ciprofloxacin for 10 days, was achieved in 70
and 68 versus 57 % of patients [23]. data analysis is
ongoing.

2.4 adverse events
the most frequently reported adverse events associated
with topical  xxxd2107xxx  (n = 618) in the two phase iii
trials in patients with otitis externa were ear pruritus and
nausea, both of which occurred in 1 % of patients [5].
preliminary results of the phase ii trial in patients with
cuti report that the  xxxd2107xxx  (iv and oral) was well
tolerated with low rates of mainly gastrointestinal adverse
events [23].
oral  xxxd2107xxx  was generally well tolerated in healthy
volunteers (n = 95) [20]. the incidence of adverse events
(any cause) was generally similar in groups receiving oncedaily  xxxd2107xxx  (150–800 mg) or placebo, except for
gastrointestinal adverse events, the most common of which
was flatulence. other adverse events associated with  xxxd2107xxx  included diarrhoea, nausea, headache and nasopharyngitis. there were no clinically relevant changes in
laboratory or cardiovascular parameters.
iv  xxxd2107xxx  single doses (200–1000 mg) or multiple
doses (600–1000 mg) once daily for 7 days was not associated with clinically relevant changes in laboratory test
parameters in a well-designed, placebo-controlled study in
healthy volunteers (n = 58) [21]. adverse events were
reported in 35 subjects (60 %), including musculoskeletal
disorders (14 events), headache (10), diarrhoea (7) and
administration site disorders (8). there were no reports of
serious adverse events.
2.5 ongoing clinical trials
two randomized, double-blind phase ii trials of  xxxd2107xxx  in patients with utis (complicated and uncomplicated) are complete but full results are pending.
preliminary results from the trial in cuti are available
(sect. 2.3.2) [nct 01928433], but no results are available
regarding the trial in patients with uncomplicated uti, in
which oral  xxxd2107xxx  300 mg will be compared with oral
ciprofloxacin 250 mg, both administered twice daily for
3 days (nct00722735).

results of a completed randomized, open-label phase ii trial
in patients with h. pylori infection are also awaited (nct00
723502). in this study, patients received oral twice-daily  xxxd2107xxx  400 mg in combination with either amoxicillin
(1000 mg twice daily) or esomeprazole (40 mg twice daily).

3 current status
 xxxd2107xxx  otic suspension received its first global approval in the usa on 17 december 2014 for the treatment
of acute otitis externa caused by susceptible strains of s.
aureus and p. aeruginosa [3].
