summary
link modules are hyaluronan-binding domains found
in proteins involved in the assembly of extracellular
matrix, cell adhesion, and migration. the solution
structure of the link module from human  xxxg2297xxx  was
determined and found to consist of two a helices and
two antiparallel b sheets arranged around a large hydrophobic core. this defines the consensus fold for
the link module superfamily, which includes cd44,
 xxxg1018xxx , and  xxxg33xxx . the  xxxg2297xxx  link
module was shown to interact with hyaluronan, and a
putative binding surface was identified on the structure. a structural database search revealed close similarity between the link module and the c-type lectin
domain, with the predicted hyaluronan-binding site at
an analogous position to the carbohydrate-binding
pocket in  xxxg2048xxx .
introduction
interactions between the ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (ha), and ha-binding proteins are crucial for the formation and stability of the extracellular
matrix as well as many aspects of cell behavior during
development, morphogenesis, tumorigenesis, and inflammation (see knudson and knudson, 1993; neame
and barry, 1993; sherman et al., 1994). the ha interactions are often mediated by a common protein domain
termed a link module, also known as a proteoglycan
tandem repeat (perkins et al., 1989; hardingham and
fosang, 1992; bork and bairoch, 1995). this module
is approximately 100 amino acids in length and has
a characteristic consensus sequence, containing four
disulfide-bonded cysteines (neame et al., 1986; neame
and barry, 1993). link modules have been described in
extracellular matrix molecules (link protein,  xxxg33xxx ,
 xxxg2407xxx ,  xxxg1507xxx , and brevican), the ha receptor

cd44, and the arthritis-associated protein  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-stimulated gene-6 ( xxxg2297xxx ). the widespread use of the link module in ha binding is illustrated
below with a brief description of its role in cartilage
formation and inflammation.
link protein is an essential constituent of cartilage
extracellular matrix and, together with ha and the proteoglycan  xxxg33xxx , forms large multimolecular aggregates that provide the tissue with its capacity to bear
load and resist deformation (neame and barry, 1993).
link protein also occurs in many noncartilaginous tissues, where it stabilizes proteoglycan binding to ha
(binette et al., 1994). electron microscopy has revealed
that a dense array of alternating  xxxg33xxx  and link protein molecules form along a central ha filament (morgelin et al., 1988, 1995). link protein is comprised of an
n-terminal immunoglobulin module followed by two link
modules (neame et al., 1986) that can both bind independently to ha (grover and roughley, 1994; varelas
et al., 1995). a homologous n-terminal proteolytic fragment of  xxxg33xxx , termed the g1 domain (doege et al.,
1987), is responsible for binding to both link protein
and ha (morgelin et al., 1988; fosang et al., 1990). an
equivalent region is also found in the  xxxg33xxx -related
proteoglycans  xxxg2407xxx ,  xxxg1507xxx , and brevican, which
are expressed in the central nervous system and brain
(zimmermann and ruoslahti, 1989; rauch et al., 1992;
yamada et al., 1994).
the cell surface molecule cd44 has a single n-terminal link module (goldstein et al., 1989; haynes et al.,
1989) that is involved in ha binding (peach et al., 1993).
cd44 on cartilage chondrocytes is involved both in the
assembly of the pericellular matrix, by binding to ha in
coordination with proteoglycans, and in the local turnover of ha by endocytosis (knudson and knudson,
1993). cd44 also has proinflammatory functions, being
up-regulated on many synovial cell types in patients
with arthritis (haynes et al., 1991). in murine models of
arthritis, cd44 mediates the migration of inflammatory
leukocytes into the extravascular compartment of the
synovium by ha binding (mikecz et al., 1995). in this
regard, the rolling of lymphocytes on vascular endothelium has recently been found to occur via the interaction
of cd44 with ha (degrendele et al., 1996).
human  xxxg2297xxx  was first cloned from a cdna library
prepared from tnf-treated fs-4 fibroblasts and contains a link and a cub module as shown in figure 1
(lee et al., 1992). there is no constitutive expression in
fibroblasts, chondrocytes, or synovial cells, but rapid
onset of transcription, and subsequent secretion of the
gene product, is seen after treatment with interleukin-1
or tnf (see maier et al., 1996).  xxxg2297xxx  protein has been
detected in the synovial fluids from individuals with arthritis, but is not present in normals, and it was found
to be constitutively expressed in synoviocytes from a
rheumatoid arthritis patient (wisniewski et al., 1993).
it thus seems likely that  xxxg2297xxx  is produced locally in
inflamed joints and may serve as a useful marker in
arthritis. recombinant  xxxg2297xxx  coprecipitates with ha
in the presence of cationic detergent and is, therefore,

likely to be an ha-binding protein, potentially via its link
module. it has been suggested that  xxxg2297xxx  might be
involved in the destabilization of ha–proteoglycan complexes at sites of inflammation (lee et al., 1992), but a
recent report indicates that it may have an anti-inflammatory role (wisniewski et al., 1996).
the link module is thus clearly involved in a variety
of important functions related to ha binding, yet nothing
is known about the structural basis of this activity. we
have produced the link module from  xxxg2297xxx  (referred
to here as residues 1–98; see figure 1) by expression
in escherichia coli, as described previously (day et al.,
1996). the expressed polypeptide was shown to bind
ha, and its 3-dimensional structure was determined in
solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. the  xxxg2297xxx  link module structure, which defines the consensus fold for this module superfamily,
was unexpectedly found to have structural similarity to
other protein domains that bind carbohydrate.
results and discussion
structure of the  xxxg2297xxx  link module
the structure determination of the  xxxg2297xxx  link module
was based on a total of 875 nuclear overhauser effect
(noe)-derived interproton distance, and 19 phi dihedral
angle, restraints obtained from spectra collected at ph
6.0 (see experimental procedures). a total of 200 structures were calculated, and of these the 20 lowest energy
structures were selected. figure 1 shows the number
of noes per residue, which correlates well with the rootmean-square deviation (rmsd) from the mean atomic
positions. as illustrated in figure 2a, only the n- and

c-termini of the module (residues 1 and 94–98, respectively) are disordered. for residues 2–93, the rmsd from
the mean structure is 0.54 6 0.09 å for the ca, c, and
n atoms, indicating that the backbone of the link module is well defined. the core of the molecule is also well
defined, with an rmsd of 0.99 6 0.11 å, from the average
coordinates, for all heavy atoms. this is illustrated in
figure 2b, which shows an overlay of the disulfide bonds
and selected hydrophobic core residues from the family
of structures superimposed on the mean backbone.
the structure, which has a compact fold with a somewhat flattened shape, contains two a helices and two
antiparallel b sheets, as shown in figure 3. the position
of these secondary structure elements in relation to the
link module sequence is indicated in figure 1. in the
absence of hydrogen exchange data (see experimental
procedures), elements of secondary structure were defined on the basis of noe connectivities. sheet i (si)
is composed of three strands: b1 (residues 2–6); b2
(residues 29–31); and b6 (residues 89–93). the short
strand b2 pairs almost perpendicularly with b6. the two
peripheral strands of si, b1 and b2, are connected by
a turn (residues 8–11) similar to a type ii turn (wilmot
and thornton, 1988) and a 10 residue helix (a1, residues
16–25), whereas the central b6 strand is linked to the
a1 helix by a disulfide bond (cys-23–cys-92). the a1
helix has a typical n-terminal capping sequence (thr15 and glu-18) and a c-terminal, glycine-based (gly-27
and gly-28) schellman motif (harper and rose, 1993;
aurora et al., 1994). the other antiparallel b sheet (sii)
is also composed of three strands (b3, residues 49–51;
b4, 56–60; b5, 75–81) where the b5 strand contains a
bulge (77–79). sheet si is in contact with sii via the

is shown by a blue ribbon.

aromatic residues to the core, where the two tryptophans (51 and 88) lie very close together. in a 1-dimensional nmr spectrum, methyl protons are seen at
20.532 and 21.089 ppm (day et al., 1996). these come
from val-57 (b4) where the protons are shifted to high
field owing to close contact with trp-51 (b3) and trp88 (b6). we note that asp-89 in b6 is completely buried
within the protein and is likely to have a high pka. this
amino acid may form hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide protons of amino acids 11–13 and thus be
involved in restraining the region between b1 and a1
(residues 7–15).
the n- and c-termini of the link module are close to
each other in such a way that val-2 and tyr-93 are
adjacent residues and define the boundaries of the
structural domain (see figures 1 and 2). the n-terminal
and the five c-terminal residues are not well-resolved
in the structure and, therefore, are probably domainconnecting peptides. the novel structure reported here
defines the global fold for this module type.

formation of a parallel b-sheet structure, pairing residues 50 and 51 of b3 with 89 and 90 of b6. the six
residue a2 helix (36–41) lies in a loop, between b2 and
b3. the irregular segment (42–48) following this helix is
linked, by the cys-47–cys-68 disulfide, to the long loop
(61–74) between b4 and b5 that is rich in glycine and
proline.
the  xxxg2297xxx  link module has a large and well-defined
hydrophobic core composed of side chains from 21
amino acids, including the disulfide bond between cys23 and cys-92 (see figure 4). the majority of these
residues are located either in the sii sheet (b3, ala-49,
gly-50, trp-51; b4, val-57, gly-58, pro-60; b5, ile-75,
ile-76, ile-80) or in the b6 strand (asp-89, ala-90, tyr-91,
cys-92). strands b3 and b6 have a particularly important
role in stabilizing the structure and provide much of the
central scaffold. figure 2b shows the contribution of

comparison with other link modules
figure 4 also shows a comparison of the amino acid
sequences of the  xxxg2297xxx  link module with those from
human cd44,  xxxg1018xxx , and the g1 domain
of  xxxg33xxx , in which the level of sequence identity
ranges from 32.3% (cd44 and lk-2) to 37.9% ( xxxd147xxx ).
from this alignment it can be seen that the residues
that define the hydrophobic core in  xxxg2297xxx , including
the amino acids of the b3 and b6 sheets, are highly
conserved in these proteins. there are no insertions or
deletions present in regions corresponding to elements
of the secondary structure, and those that do occur
would mainly affect the length of exposed loops. possible exceptions are a seven amino acid insertion and a
three residue deletion, at the position of the bulge in
the b5 strand, in the second link module of  xxxg33xxx 
(ag-2) and cd44, respectively. in ag-2, this insertion is
expected to be accommodated as an additional loop
within the structure, whereas the absence of a bulge in
cd44 may cause local structural modification to the

modified to give biotinylation of about 1 in 50 of the
carboxyl moieties. a similar probe has been used recently to detect the presence of ha-binding proteins on
blots and in tissue slices (yu and toole, 1995). figure
5a shows that the  xxxg2297xxx  link module does indeed bind
to ha. there was close to maximum binding of bha
when 25 pmol (z0.3 mg) of the link module was coated
per well. therefore, this amount of protein was used in
the subsequent competition assay. in figure 5b, it can
be seen that the binding of bha could be almost fully
competed by unlabeled ha. the g1 domain of  xxxg33xxx ,
a well-characterized ha-binding domain (fosang et al.,
1990) that contains two link modules, was found to bind
bha in a similar manner, indicating that the assay is
reliable (see figure 5b). therefore, the recombinant link
module of  xxxg2297xxx  interacts specifically with ha. these
experiments were performed at a ph (5.8) at which the
protein has been shown by nmr to be fully folded (data
not shown).

which consists of two helices (a1 and a2) and two antiparallel b

the si sheet is composed of strands b1, b2, and b6 and the sii
sheet of b3, b4, and b5. the b5 strand contains a bulge (residues
77–79), which is indicated by no shading. this figure, in which the
structure is in the same orientation as in figure 2, was made using
the program molscript (kraulis, 1991).

length or position of the b5 strand (relative to b4). therefore, the link module from  xxxg2297xxx  is typical of link modules in general, and our structure will allow useful modeling of other superfamily members.
ha binding of the  xxxg2297xxx  link module
recombinant full-length  xxxg2297xxx  has been demonstrated
previously to interact with ha (lee et al., 1992). an ha
binding assay was developed to investigate whether
the expressed link module of  xxxg2297xxx , used in structure
determination, mediates this interaction (see experimental procedures). in this assay, the binding of biotinylated ha (bha) to a link module–coated plate was measured colorimetrically using a 250 kda fragment of ha

identification of a putative ha-binding surface
visual inspection of the link module structure revealed
the presence of a solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch
made up of tyr-12, tyr-59, tyr-78, and part of trp-88
(see figure 6). hydrophobic amino acids are highly conserved at these positions in cd44,  xxxg1018xxx ,
and  xxxg33xxx  (see figure 4). similar amino acids have
been found to have important roles in protein–carbohydrate interactions, e.g., by making hydrophobic contacts with the c-5 and c-6 carbons of hexopyranoside
rings (vyas, 1991; sharon, 1993). positively and negatively charged amino acids (lys-11, lys-72, asp-77, arg81, and glu-86) are arranged around this patch (see
figure 6). arginine and lysine residues have been implicated in ha binding by chemical modification studies
on  xxxg1018xxx  (lyon, 1986) and  xxxg33xxx  (hardingham et al., 1976), where these are likely to form
ionic interactions with the carboxylate anions of ha
(christner et al., 1977). in light of these data, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic region of the link module could
be involved in ha binding. similar patches are likely to
be formed in the other members of the link module
superfamily, as there is conservation of the hydrophobic
and some of the charged residues. as can be seen from

figure 4. multiple sequence alignment of the link module superfamily
sequence alignment of the  xxxg2297xxx  link module with those from cd44,  xxxg1018xxx  (lk-1 and lk-2), and the g1 domain of  xxxg33xxx 
( xxxd147xxx  and ag-2). all the sequences are from human proteins and taken from genbank (humcd44b, hslinkc, and humagpro). the
alignment was generated using the program amps (barton and sternberg, 1987), and minor adjustments were made manually. for the  xxxg2297xxx 
link module amino acid numbering, secondary structure (ss) elements (a, a helix; b, b strand; caret indicates the bulge in b5) and core
residues (black background) are shown. the consensus sequence (con) indicates the presence of identical amino acids (one-letter code) or
conservative replacements (plus: k or r; minus: d or e; t: s or t; p: aromatics f, y, or w; phi: aliphatic hydrophobics a, m, i, l, or v; 5
y: p or
phi) in at least five of the sequences as indicated by the gray background. regions implicated in ha binding are underlined, and the residue
r-41 in cd44 is shown in lower case. amino acids that form the putative ha-binding surface in  xxxg2297xxx  are denoted by closed diamonds. on
the basis of this alignment, the  xxxg2297xxx  link module (residues 1–93) has 32.3% identity with cd44, 33.7% with lk-1, 32.3% with lk-2, 37.9%
with  xxxd147xxx , and 35.4% with ag-2.

(asterisk) or presence of competing unlabeled ha. values are plotted
as mean absorbance (n 5 4) 6 sem.

figure 4, the amino acids that form this surface are
brought together from different parts of the sequence.
interestingly, most of these amino acids come from regions of the link module that have been previously implicated in ha binding of  xxxg1018xxx  or cd44
(goetinck et al., 1987; yang et al., 1994; zheng et al.,
1995). furthermore, peach et al. (1993) have demonstrated that mutation of the conserved arg-41 of cd44
(equivalent to lys-11 in our structure) to alanine completely abolishes ha binding. this basic amino acid is
located next to one of the surface-exposed hydrophobic
residues (tyr-12) on the 7–15 loop between b1 and a1.
therefore, this loop region may be of particular functional importance. as noted above, the buried asp-89
(in its protonated state) may have a role in restraining
this loop. this amino acid is conserved in cd44,  xxxd147xxx ,
ag-2, and lk-1, but is replaced by a glycine in lk-2,
as shown in figure 4. it is possible that the nature of
the amino acid residue at this position will determine
the ph dependencies of ha binding by these proteins.

the solvent-accessible surface of the protein is shown, where residues that comprise the predicted ha-binding site are highlighted:
aromatics in yellow (tyr-12, tyr-59, tyr-78, and trp-88), basics in
blue (lys-11, lys-72, and arg-81), and acidic residues in red (asp77 and glu-86). the ha 12, i.e., six [d-glucuronic acid (b1→3) n-acetyld-glucosamine (b1→4)] disaccharide units, is shown in green, with
the carboxyl oxygens of d-glucuronic acid and the nitrogen atom
of  xxxd2683xxx  in red and blue, respectively. the n- and
c-termini and lys-11 of the protein are indicated. from the figure
it can be seen that, if a single link module does interact with an
ha 10, then contacts could occur with regions of the protein outside
the predicted binding surface.

it is well established that a decasaccharide (i.e., ha10 )
is the minimum size of ha that can interact strongly with
 xxxg33xxx  or link protein (hardingham and muir, 1973;
hascall and heinegård, 1974). these proteins each contain two link modules which, in link protein at least,
can both interact with ha (grover and roughley, 1994).
to our knowledge, the size of ha oligomer that interacts
with an individual module in these proteins has not been
studied directly. however, cd44, which contains a single
link module, binds to an ha6 (underhill et al., 1983). in
 xxxg2297xxx , which also contains a single link module, the
size of carbohydrate ligand has not yet been established. figure 6 shows a speculative model of how an
ha 12 could dock on the putative ha-binding site discussed above. work is in progress in our laboratory to
define this binding site experimentally.

comparison of the link module
with other structures
an automated search of the dali database (holm et al.,
1992; holm and sander, 1994) revealed an unexpected
similarity between the link module structure and the
c-type lectin domain of human  xxxg1382xxx -chain ( xxxg1382xxx ; sheriff et al., 1994). an overlay of
these structures is shown in figure 7. these domains
have identical topologies and a very similar organization
of secondary structure with an rmsd of 2.89 å for backbone atoms of 70 structurally equivalent residues. we

figure 7. a comparison of the structures of the link module and the c-type lectin domain
a stereoview showing the link module in blue and the c-type lectin domain in yellow. residues 1–96 of the link module are overlaid with
residues 119–228 of the human  xxxg1382xxx  (sheriff et al., 1994) on the basis of structurally equivalent residues determined by a search of the
dali database (holm et al., 1992; holm and sander, 1994) with the link module mean coordinates. the equivalent disulfide bonds in the link
module (cys-23 to cys-92) and in the c-type lectin (cys-135 to cys-224) are shown. the long calcium-binding loop of the c-type lectin,
residues 166–201, is not displayed for the sake of clarity. this region has no equivalent in the link module. residues 165 and 202, the points
where this loop enters and leaves the structure, are indicated on the figure by small spheres. the coordinates of the c-type lectin domain
were obtained from the brookhaven protein data bank (entry 1hup).

note that the interstrand hydrogen bond network is similar in the two structures. the major differences between
the structures is the length of two loops. the long loop
(residues 166–201 in  xxxg1382xxx ), which contains ca21-binding residues in the lectin domain (weis et al., 1991), is
absent from the link module. at this position the link
module has a much shorter loop (residues 53–55) between the b3 and b4 strands (see figure 4). similarly,
the loop between b4 and b5 (residues 62–74) in the link
module is shorter in the lectin domain. the interiors of
the structures are also quite similar, with conservative
replacements found in the lectin domain, at equivalent
sequence positions, for 13 of the 21 core residues in
the link module. this includes the disulfide bond between cys-23 and cys-92 in the link module (cys-135
to cys-224 in the lectin domain). these structural similarities between the link module and the lectin domain
suggest that they have a common evolutionary origin,
even though the overall sequence similarity is below the
level of statistical significance. this is intriguing given
that both of these structures are involved in carbohydrate recognition.
recently, the n-terminal regions of the s2 and s3
subunits of pertussis toxin, from the whooping cough
bacteria bordetella pertussis, have been found to be
structurally related to the c-type lectin domain (stein et
al., 1994). the s2 and s3 structures have an identical
topology to the link module with a similar organization
of secondary structure, where only the b1 strand and

a1 helix are missing (data not shown). like the link
module, they do not contain a long ca21-binding loop.
at the sequence level, there is no significant similarity
to either the link module or lectin domain, but there
are a number of residues in equivalent core positions,
including a disulfide bond.
in the c-type lectin domain of mbp, the residues that
bind ca21 ions are also largely responsible for carbohydrate binding (weis et al., 1992). these amino acids are
mostly located in the long loop (residues 166–201 in
 xxxg1382xxx ), which is absent in the link module (see above).
since there is no evidence that ha binding is ca21 dependent, it is perhaps not surprising that the link module
lacks this region. however, asp-77 and tyr-78 in the
putative link module ha-binding site are in similar positions (on the b5 strand) to other calcium-chelating residues in mbp (asn-212 and asp-213 in human  xxxg1382xxx ). in
the lectin domain of  xxxg2048xxx , although ca21-chelating
residues are functionally important, a much larger protein surface is involved in carbohydrate binding than in
mbp (graves et al., 1994; kogan et al., 1995). we note
that amino acids of the putative link module ha-binding
surface (tyr-59, arg-81, glu-86, and trp-88) are in equivalent backbone positions to residues of the sialyl lewisx
binding site of  xxxg2048xxx  (tyr-94, glu-107, lys-111, and
lys-113, respectively). this is interesting, particularly
given the recent finding that cd44 can mediate the rolling of leukocytes on the vascular endothelium by binding
to ha (degrendele et al., 1996), a process in which

the selectins are also involved (lawrence and springer,
1991; jutila et al., 1994).
conclusions
we have defined the consensus structure for the link
module, which gives novel molecular insight into the
mode of action of a protein superfamily involved in extracellular matrix assembly and cell migration. identification of a putative ha-binding site on the link module
forms the basis for further investigations to define the
exact nature of this important protein–carbohydrate interaction in the arthritis-associated protein  xxxg2297xxx . the
structural similarity between the link module and the
c-type lectin domain suggests that these have a common evolutionary origin, which provides a possible explanation for the similar roles of cd44 and the selectins
in leukocyte extravasation at sites of inflammation.

the link module corresponds to residues 36–133 in the  xxxg2297xxx  preprotein (lee et al., 1992). cloning and overexpression of this module

has been reported previously (day et al., 1996); the purified proteins
were shown to have the expected disulfide bond organization and
the correct molecular masses.
nmr spectroscopy and structure calculations
protein samples (including 15n-enriched samples) were dissolved in
either h 2o, containing 10% (v/v) d2o and 0.02% (w/v) nan3, or d2o
($99.96% isotopic purity) to a concentration of z1 mm and were
adjusted to the required ph with naoh or naod, respectively. all
nmr spectra were recorded using home-built/ge omega spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of 600 and 750 mhz. felix
2.3 (biosym) was used to process the nmr data, and baseline correction and peak picking were performed with the programs described in hatanaka et al. (1994).
homonuclear 2-dimensional 1h nmr spectra were collected at
either ph 5.1 and 378c or at ph 6.0 and 208c. in addition, 4 mm
znso4 was included in the ph 6.0 samples, as this was found to
increase their long-term stability while having little effect on spectral
quality. at ph 6.0 and 208c, high quality noesy, but relatively poor
total correlated spectra (tocsy), were obtained. the low quality of
the tocsy data was due to some self-association of the protein
(a. j. d., unpublished data). at ph 5.1 and 378c, better tocsy data
were obtained, but the noesy spectra were overlapped (particularly
in the fingerprint region) owing to the presence of both folded and
partially unfolded protein in the sample. as neither condition alone
gave data of sufficient quality for complete sequential assignment,
a combination of noesy (jeener et al., 1979; macura et al., 1981),
cosy (braunschweiler and ernst, 1983; bax and davis, 1985), and
tocsy (aue et al., 1976; brown et al., 1988) spectra at both ph 5.1
and ph 6.0 was used.
semiautomatic assignment of the noesy spectra, collected at
ph 6.0 with a mixing time of 150 ms, was performed with the program
xplor-up (hatanaka et al., 1994) to generate an unbiased set of
distance restraints. ambiguous noe cross peaks were assigned, in
an iterative manner, with reference to calculated preliminary structures, using conservative selection parameters. this analysis was
helped by the high proportion of amino acids with simple spin networks (13 glycine and 12 alanine). peak intensities were transformed
into distances on the basis of known distances: sequential d an b
strand 5 2.2 å in 1 h2o noesy, and interstrand d aa in antiparallel b
sheet 5 2.3 å in 2h2 o noesy using the relationship (noe intensity)
~ (distance)2a. an empirical value of a 5 4 was used to take account
of spin diffusion effects at the mixing time used (suri and levy,
1993). the upper bond distance constraints were the calculated
distance plus 0.5 å, and the lower limits were set to 1.8 å. after 10
cycles of iterative noesy peak assignment and structure calculation

a total of 348 intraresidue (|i-j| 5 0), 167 sequential (|i-j| 5 1), 109
medium-range (2 # |i-j| # 5), and 251 long-range (|i-j| $ 6) (including
2 derived from disulfide bonds) distance restraints were used in the
final structure calculations. a 15n–1h hmqc-j experiment (kay and
bax, 1990) at ph 6.0 was used to determine phi dihedral angles.
slow-exchanging amide protons were not detected, as the protein
was dissolved under conditions at which it is completely unfolded
(i.e., zph 3.5). consequently, no hydrogen bond restraints were
applied during structure calculations.
a total of 200 structures were calculated on the basis of 875 noe
distance and 19 phi dihedral angle constraints using the program
xplor 3.1 (brünger, 1992). the restraints for the disulfide bridges
were included in the bond term just before the cooling stage of the
xplor protocol. the final values of the experimental terms in the
force field used during simulated annealing were fnoe 5 1831.0 6
63.2 kj mol21, fcdih 5 9.27 6 6.66 kj mol21, with force constants of
209 kj mol21 å 22 and 209 kj mol21 rad22, respectively. the 20 structures with the lowest residual energy (frepel 1 f noe 1 fcdih) were
selected, with deviations from idealized covalent geometry of
0.0089 6 0.0003 å (bonds), 1.36 6 0.0278 (angles), and 2.07 6 0.0328
(impropers).
the mean structure was obtained by averaging the coordinates
of the 20 selected structures and subjecting the resulting coordinates to further restrained minimization. in the mean structure there
are two torsion angle violations greater than 5.08 (maximum, 13.88)
and no distance constraint violations greater than 0.51 å. these
violations result from the relatively low number of constraints per
residue, which was a consequence of the difficulties encountered
in recording the nmr data, relative to the good sampling properties
of the structure calculation method (see above). however, the small
deviation from idealized bond lengths shows the structure has good
covalent geometry. the coordinates of the mean structure have
been deposited in the brookhaven protein data bank (entry 1tsg).
model building
an ha 12 was built and docked manually onto the link module structure using the program sybyl (tripos associates). to remove van
der waals clashes introduced by the modeling process, the complex
(i.e., the link module and ha12) was subjected to 100 rounds of
conjugate gradient minimization using the tripos force field.
biotinylation of ha
highly purified ha with a molecular mass of 250 kda (kabi pharmacia, sweden), a gift from dr. mike bayliss (kennedy institute of
rheumatology, london), was biotinylated by the method of pouyani
and prestwich (1994). to 100 ml of 5 mg/ml ha in h2o (i.e., z1.32
mmol of carboxyl groups), 25 ml of 10 mg/ml adipic dihydrazide (1.43
mmol) was added, and the ph was adjusted to 4.75 with 0.1 m hcl.
to this, 5 mmol (9.55 ml of a 100 mg/ml solution) of 1-ethyl-3-[3(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide was added. the reaction mixture was maintained at ph 4.75 by addition of 0.1 m hcl, and after
2 hr no further rise in ph was seen. the ph was then titrated to 7.0
with 1 m naoh. the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1 ml, dialyzed
exhaustively against h2o, and then lyophilized. the freeze-dried
hydrazido–ha was dissolved in 80 ml of 0.1 m nahco 3 containing
65 mg (29 nmol) of immunopure sulfo-nhs-biotin (pierce) and mixed
at room temperature for 18 hr. hydrolyzed biotin that precipitated
during the reaction was removed by centrifugation. the supernatant
was purified on a 10dg desalting column (bio-rad, uk) and equilibrated in h2 o to remove any unreacted biotin, and fractions containing bha were lyophilized. the preparation was resuspended in
100 ml of h2o. using this method, a maximum of 1 in 45 of the
carboxyls of ha could be modified with biotin (i.e., each ha molecule
should contain less than 15 biotin moieties).
ha binding assay
this ha binding assay measures the amount of bha binding to
protein immobilized on a microtiter plate in the absence or presence
of competing unlabeled ha. all dilutions, incubations, and washes
were performed in 10 mm na-acetate, 140 mm nacl, 0.05% (v/v)
tween 20 (ph 5.8) at room temperature unless otherwise stated.
wells of plastic linbro microtiter plates (icn, uk) were coated overnight either with 200 ml per well of protein solution in 20 mm na2co3

cell
774

(ph 9.6) or with buffer alone. the coating solution was removed and
the plates were washed three times. the plates were blocked by
incubation for 90 min at 378c with 1% (w/v) bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
followed by three washes. a 1:10,000 dilution of bha (see above)
was made, and 200 ml of this solution, which either contained no
ha or various amounts of ha (2.5–2,500 ng), was added to the wells
and incubated for 4 hr. the ha used for competition was from human
umbilical cord with average molecular mass of 4.4 3 10 6 da (sigma,
uk). the plates were washed three times, and 200 ml of a 1:10,000
dilution of extra-avidin alkaline phosphatase (sigma, uk) was
added and incubated for 30 min, followed by three washes. a 1 mg/
ml solution of the alkaline phosphate substrate, disodium
p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, in 100 mm tris–hcl, 100 mm nacl, 5 mm
mgcl2 (ph 9.3) (200 ml) was added to all wells and incubated until
sufficient color had developed (8–12 min). the absorbance at 405 nm
was determined on a microtiter plate reader (mkii titertek multiscan
plus). all absorbances were corrected against blank wells, which
contained substrate solution alone.
the optimum amount of link_tsg-6 used in this assay was determined by coating with a range of protein concentrations (0.5–100
pmol per well) and binding bha in the absence of competitor (figure
5a). on this basis, 25 pmol per well of link_tsg-6 (or the g1 domain
of  xxxg33xxx ) was used in the competition assay. the g1 domain of
 xxxg33xxx , purified from porcine laryngeal cartilage, was provided
by ms. sarah howat and dr. mike bayliss (kennedy institute of
rheumatology, london).
