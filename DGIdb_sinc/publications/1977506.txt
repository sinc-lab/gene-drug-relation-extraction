introduction

it is well established that a blood and tissue eosinophilia is
associated with helminthic infections and that eosinophils
are also a feature of allergic inflarnmation [1]. eosinophilmediated damage might be an important factor in
denudation of the bronchial epithelium in asthma [2],
following adhesion to the vascular endothelium and
subsequent diapedesis, eosinophils, like neutrophils, tnay
become activated as a result of changes in the microenvironment. in vitro, stimulation of eosinophils with
various agonists results in the generation of lipid mediators [3,4] and partial reductive products of oxygen [5]
together with exocytosis of basic granule proteins [6], the
effector function of eosinophiis in adaptive itnmunity, i.e.
the extracellular killing of non-phagocytosable targets
such as opsonized helminthic larvae, is triggered via
complement and/or immunoglobulin receptors present
on the eell membrane [7].

reeeptors for immunogiobulins and adhesion
glycoproteins

there are a number of specific receptors which may play a
role in the recognition of opsonized particles and the
activation of cellular responses [8]. among those weil
characterized for the neutrophil and the monocyte are the
three types of fey receptor (fcyrt/ xxxg770xxx , fcyrii/
 xxxg772xxx   xxxg773xxx   xxxg774xxx , fcyriii/cdi6), complement receptors (crl/
 xxxg510xxx  and cr3/cd1 tb), and other membrane proteins
important for intercellular adhesion (lfa-1 -alpha/
cdi la, pl50,95-alpha/cdl ic and icam-1/ xxxg1127xxx ),
fcyrl is the only receptor that will bind monomerie
igg, while fcyrti and fcyriii only exhibit detectable
binding with multivalent ligand, such as immune complexes [9],
complement receptor type one (crl) is the receptor
for the third component of complement, c3b. the
leucocyte integrins are a family of three receptors, lfa-1,
cr3 and pi 50,95, which are heterodimers composed of
two non-covalently linked polypeptide chains. each
receptor has a distinct alpha chain (molecular weights
190 kd, 185 kd and 150 kd, respectively) which is
associated with a common beta-chain (mw 95 kd) [10].
complement receptor type three (cr3) is the receptor for

c3bi and has binding sites for other tnolecliles [ii];
pl50,95 binds c3bi and may also bind other hgands [12].
lyinphocytefunction-associated antigen-1 (lfa-1) interacts with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) on
other cells to facilitate intercellular adhesion [13].
eosinophils exhibit considerable heterogeneity and ean
be separated into distinct populations by density gradient
centrifugation. there is evidence that the lower density
ceils are activated in terms of metabolic activity and igg
fc and complement receptor expression [14-16], much of
the work characterizing igg fc and complement receptors on eosinophils has used the rosette technique [17],
which is a relatively imprecise method for determining
receptor expression. there are few data on the expression
of the leucocyte integrins on eosinophits [18 20].
we have used specific monoclonal antibodies and flow
cytometry to investigate the expression of these receptors
on normal density and low density eosinophils. the
findings were compared with the neutrophil and the
monocyte in order to identify differences which may be
relevant to the specialized function of the eosinophil.
several novel properties of the human eosinophil were
established. these were: (1) that the eosinophil expressed
fcyrtt ( xxxg772xxx   xxxg773xxx   xxxg774xxx ) only (unlike monocytes which bear
fcyrii and fcyriii); (2) that the absence of fcyriii
(cd 16) on eosinophils served as a basis for distinguishing
eosinophil and neutrophil populations by itntnunofluoreseence; (3) that the leucocyte adhesion glycoproteiils,
lfa-1-alpha (cdi la), cr3-alpha (cdllb), pl50,95alpha(cdllc)and the common beta-chain (cd 18), were
expressed on the eosinophil as well as the neutrophil; and
(4) that cdi 8 expression was signilicantiy reduced on low
density eosinophils from the hypereosinophiiic syndrome
[21]. thus, our findings emphasize the unique phenotype
of the human eosinophil in terms of fey receptor
expression, the similarity of the eosinophil and neutrophil
with regard to the leucocyte integrins and thateo.sinophils
of low density do not differ greatly from those of normal
density in terms of receptor expression.

mechanisms of local eosinophitia

eosinophil leucocytes are known to accumulate and
persist preferentially at the site of allergic tissue reactions

[1,22]. for example, frew and kay [23], employing skin
biopsies from late-phase cutaneous reactions (lpcr) in
human atopic subjects, demonstrated activated (bg2+)
eosinophils 48 hr after challenge with specific allergen. in
contrast, neutrophils appeared early and their numbers
decreased with time. the mechanism of local tissue
eosinophilia is largely unexplained. although platelet
activating factor (paf) is a potent eosinophil chemoattractant, it was shown to have even greater effects on
neutrophil locomotion [24]. inter!eukin-5 ( xxxg1180xxx ) has been
shown to be a selective chemotactic agent for the
eosinophil, but the activity was very weak compared with
that of paf [25]. furthermore, the general concept that
the elaboration of selective chemotactic factors explains
the local accumulation of various cell types in inflammatory reactions remains largely unproven. for this reason
other mechanisms need to be considered to explain the
local eosinophilia observed in allergy, asthma and helminthic infections.
the role of  xxxg1180xxx 
using in-.siui hybridization, we have recently identified
nirna for  xxxg1180xxx  in both allergen-induced lpcr and
bronchial mucosal biopsies from allergic asthma patients
[26]. in addition, ll-5 [27],  xxxg1177xxx  [28] and granulocyte/
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) [29]
prolong the survival of human eosinophils />/ vitro and
this may provide a partial explanation for ihe eosinophilic
response in vivo. tl-5 has a number of selective effects on
eosinophils. these include terminal differentiation ofthe
committed eosinophil precursor [30,31]. enhanced cytotoxicity and increased respiratory burst activity [32]. we
recently examined the role ofil-5 in the eosinophil adhesion reaction. we proposed that  xxxg1180xxx  promotes preferential hyperadhesion of eosinophils, as compared with the
neutrophi] [33]. lamas et al. [34] had previously reported
that eosinophil adherence to cultured human vascular
endothelial cells (hvec) or gelatinized plates could be
enhanced by prior incubation with fmlp or tnf.
furthermore, a number of cytokines acted directly on
cultured hvec to give enhanced adhesion of untreated
eosinophils. paf was also shown to stimulate increased
eosinophil adherence lo hvec or plastic surfaces.
enhanced adhesion was inhibited by prior incubation
with a monoclonal antibody directed against the common
beta-chain ofthe cd! 1/18 leucocyte integrin family [20].
thus, we have compared  xxxg1180xxx  with  xxxg1177xxx , gm-csf and
paf to determine whether this cytokine preferentially
influences eosinophil as opposed to neutrophil, hyperadhesiveness to plasma-coated glass (pcg) or human
microvascular endothelial cells (hmvec). furthermore,
the contribution ofthe cd 11/18 complex to this process

was assessed using both flow cytometry and inhibition
assays.
we found that  xxxg1180xxx ,  xxxg1177xxx  and gm-csf also induced a
time-dependent increase in adherence of normal density
eosinophils to pcg, optimal at 60 min, whereas the effect
of paf was greater at 15 min. similar results were
obtained with neutrophils with the exception that  xxxg1180xxx 
had minimal and non-significant effects on this cell type.
unstimulated eosinophils and neutrophils also adhered
to pcg or hmvec, but in low numbers. pre-incubation
of eosinophils with  xxxg1180xxx , gm-csf or paf resulted in
dose-dependent increases in the numbers of cells adherent
to pcg.  xxxg1177xxx  had a smaller but significant effect on
enhanced eosinophil adhesion to pcg, while il-2 and
lyso-paf were.ineffective. neutrophils gave similar levels
of baseline and stimulated adhesion to pcg as eosinophils,  xxxg1180xxx  again had no significant stimulatory effect.
 xxxg1180xxx  also increased eosinophil, but not neulrophil, adherence to hmvec in a concentration-depend ent manner.
pre-incubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effect on tl-5-, gm-csf- or pafstimulated eosinophil adhesion. the contribution ofthe
cdll/18 leucocyte integrins to  xxxg1180xxx  and paf-induced
eosinophilic hyperadherence was investigated by inhibition experiments utilizing monoclonal antibodies was
also assessed. enhanced adhesion to pcg (by paf) or
hmvec (by  xxxg1180xxx ) was inhibited by (ranked in order of
potency) anti-cr3-aipha = common beta-chain > lfa1-alpha. anti-pl50,95-alpha had no measurable effect.
baseline adhesion by unstimulated eosinophils was not
significantly influenced by prior incubation with these
monoclonal antibodies. using flow cytometry,  xxxg1180xxx  and
 xxxg1177xxx  were found to upregulate eosinophil but not neutrophil cr3 expression. these findings demonstrate that tl5 enhances eosinophil, but not neutrophil adherence
reactions, by a mechanism dependent, at least in part, on
the cdl 1/18 family of adhesion glycoproteins.
conclusions
the density of expression of a number of functionally
relevant receptors appears to be very similar on eosinophils and neutrophils; there may be differences in intracellular signalling mechanisms of these two cell types
which give rise to a difference in the quality of the
response to a given stimulus. in addition, while the use of
specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry gives
an accurate measure of the number of receptors on the
surface ofthe cell, it gives no indication ofthe affinity of
the receptor. therefore, there are a number of ways in
which an apparently similar level of receptor expression
could give rise to a very different level of response to a
stimulus in different cell types.

modulation of eo.sinophit furiclion

investigations of these well characterized cell surface
receptors showed only one major difference between
eosinophils and neutrophils, i.e. lack of cd 16 expression
on eosinophils. the functional consequences of this
difference are unclear. eosinophils have very distinctive
cytotoxic proteins within their granules which are crucial
to their effeetor function and which clearly distinguish
them from other inflammatory cells. it is possible that
they also possess specialized cell surface receptors which
require further characterization.
our data also suggest that in vivo., eosinophil hyperadherence is similar to that ofthe neutrophil in terms of
the dependence on cd 11/18 and involves the utilization
of cr3 and to a lesser extent lfa-i. although we
observed enhanced expression of cr3-alpha by stimulated eosinophils, the possibility that enhanced eosinophil
adhesion is dependent upon an affinity or conformational
change in the receptor and not increased expression
cannot be excluded. the observation that  xxxg1180xxx  selectively
enhanced eosinophil adherence to pcg and hmvec
may provide some insight into the preferential eosinophil
accumulation observed in atopic allergic inflammation
and infection with helminthic parasites.
