voltage-gated sodium channel blockers like phenytoin and

recent advances in adjunctive therapy for epilepsy

introduction
the world health organization estimates that 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy (1). for several decades, first-generation antiepileptic drugs (aeds)
(phenytoin,  xxxd2908xxx , carbamazepine, valproic
acid) were the main pharmacological targets for the
treatment of epileptic disorder. however, the use of
these aeds is associated with severe adverse events
(aes), drug interactions and pharmacokinetic variations.
the over-treatment of epilepsy results in serious aes
such as stevens-johnson or lyell syndrome following
unnecessary fast titration of aeds. in addition, aed polytherapy during pregnancy may increase the risk of fetal
malformations. moreover, the problem of pharmacoresistance may be encountered, where reduced drug sensitivity is due to certain neurobiological changes in brain,
thereby making treatment of epilepsy less efficient. it is
believed that approximately 30-40% of individuals with
epilepsy continue to suffer from uncontrolled seizures
despite aed treatment. this observation further limits
the use of first-generation antiepileptic drugs in the
management of epilepsy (2, 3).
during the past 2 decades, approximately 14 drugs have
been licensed, thus making drug selection a complicated task for neurologists. while efficacy (mainly in refractory seizures), safety and tolerability are the main criteria
for selection, pharmacokinetic features of a drug, its
drug interaction profile, overall quality of life and cost
are also important factors during therapy selection for
an individual patient. newer aeds are approved mainly
as adjunctive therapy in refractory epilepsy, except for
some second-generation drugs such as vigabatrin, used
for the treatment of west syndrome and lamotrigine for
idiopathic generalized seizures, in women and elderly.
the new aeds differ from older agents in several important ways, including mechanism of action, spectrum of
activity, pharmacokinetics and safety profile. the newer
aeds were developed primarily as add-on therapy
(adjunctive therapy) in epileptic patients who are resistant to older aeds. the option for refractory seizures is
the combined administration of two or more aeds with
or without the addition of novel drug. however, some of
the drugs, such as  xxxd2809xxx , lamotrigine and topiramate, were approved to be used as monotherapy in
epilepsy. the newer generation of aeds provides better
safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles. some of
these have been approved for indications other than
epilepsy, like pregabalin for neuropathic pain and topiramate for migraine (4-8). while the second generation of
aeds has yet to find a place in epilepsy therapy, a whole
266

new third generation has recently emerged. the present
review discusses the efficacy, safety and aed selection
issues for sodium channel blockers, focusing mainly on
the third generation of aeds, which are mostly under
development.
modulation of sodium channel function as
an important target for aeds
conventional and most of the second-generation aeds
act mainly via inhibition of sodium channel function,
enhancement of gabaergic transmission or blockade of
calcium channel function. the past decade has witnessed various novel targets for aed development such
as synaptic vesicle glycoprotein ( xxxg2233xxx ) for drugs like  xxxd2466xxx  and brivaracetam (9), potassium voltagegated channels (kv7/kcnq/m) for  xxxd2079xxx  and alpha2delta
subunit of calcium channels for gabapentin (10). the
major targets of second- and third-generation aeds are
summarized in table i. nevertheless, sodium channel
blockade is not the primary mechanism for some of the
aeds described in table i. an example of such a drug is
topiramate, which exerts a modest inhibition of sodium
channel-mediated responses only at high doses (11).
however, brain sodium channels continue to be an
important target for conventional, second- (fosphenytoin,  xxxd2809xxx , lamotrigine,  xxxd2090xxx , topiramate,
 xxxd3564xxx ) and third- (eslicarbazepine, brivaracetam,
carisbamate, fluorofelbamate, elpetrigine,  xxxd2436xxx ,
 xxxd3152xxx ,  xxxd3158xxx , vinpocetine) generation aeds,
and many more in development (3, 12, 13).
voltage-gated sodium channels (vgscs) are responsible
for the generation and propagation of action potentials
in excitable cells. the sodium channel protein undergoes voltage-dependent changes, regulating conductance through the channel pore. the channel exists in
three functional states: open, resting and inactivated
(14). at resting membrane potential, channels are in the
closed and resting state. depolarization causes the
channels to open, allowing influx of sodium ions, after
which the channels inactivate and remain closed until
the membrane is again repolarized to allow the channels
to return to the resting state. aeds bind to the channel,
prolonging the inactivated state accounting for inhibition during sustained depolarization (voltage-dependent) and repetitive firing (use-dependent) block (15).
vgscs are composed of a central, pore-forming alpha-subunit (vgsc-alpha) and one or more beta-subunits (vgsc-beta)
(15, 16). currently, nine isoforms of the alpha-subunit have

been characterized, of which  xxxg2026xxx  is present in skeletal
muscles,  xxxg2028xxx  in heart,  xxxg2030xxx , 1.8 and 1.9 in sensory
neurons and  xxxg2020xxx , 1.2, 1.3 and 1.6 are mainly found in
the central nervous system (cns). vgscs are often subdivided on the basis of their sensitivity to tetrodotoxin
(ttx). ttx-sensitive vgsc-alphas ( xxxg2020xxx -1.4, 1.6 and 1.7) are
active at –40 mv and have fast inactivation kinetics,
whereas ttx-resistant vgscs ( xxxg2028xxx  and 1.9) activate at
hyperpolarized states and inactivate more slowly.
several toxin binding sites have been identified on the
alpha-subunit of vgscs. while ttx binds to site-1, preventing ion flow, batrachotoxin, veratridine or aconitine bind
to toxin site-2, preventing inactivation and causing permanent channel activation (17, 18).

lamotrigine,  xxxd3564xxx , valproate,  xxxd2090xxx  and topiramate act on the fast sodium current (inaf) (3),
 xxxd2436xxx , a new aed, modulates sodium channels in a
novel manner by selectively enhancing slow inactivation
with no effect on fast inactivation. slow inactivation is
induced under conditions of sustained depolarization and
repetitive firing of neurons, both of which are relevant to
the pathophysiology of epilepsy (19). it is likely that with
the detailed understanding of the vgscs and future
development of agents with vgsc subtype specificity,
could prove to be more efficacious in specific forms of
epilepsy. however, most of the currently available aeds
do not distinguish between these channel subtypes.

the fraction of sodium channels available for activation
is regulated by fast inactivation. usually, it occurs on a
millisecond time scale and in some cases, slow inactivation occurs within seconds or minutes. while most of the
aeds such as phenytoin, carbamazepine,  xxxd2809xxx ,

267

recent advances in adjunctive therapy for epilepsy

 xxxd3564xxx . recently, a whole new generation of sodium
channel-modulating agents has emerged, the so-called
third-generation aeds, and are currently undergoing
clinical evaluation. these include eslicarbazepine
acetate, brivaracetam (ucb-34714), carisbamate (rwj333369),  xxxd2436xxx , fluorofelbamate, elpetrigine,  xxxd3152xxx ,  xxxd3158xxx  and vinpocetine. among these,
 xxxd2436xxx  was approved in august 2008 by the u.s.
food and drug administration (fda) as an adjunctive
therapy for partial-onset seizures (20).
the drug acts by a novel mechanism, selectively enhancing the slow inactivation of vgscs and by modulating
the activity of collapsing response mediator protein-2
(crmp-2) (21, 22). the latter is involved in neuronal protection from excitotoxicity and apoptosis (19). its modulation by  xxxd2436xxx  is believed to be responsible for its
neuroprotective effects (12). furthermore, the enhancement of slow inactivation of sodium channels by
 xxxd2436xxx  is a novel mechanism of modulation (19).
some third-generation aeds are the result of chemical
alterations of existing aeds. one such drug is  xxxd2034xxx , which was developed after carbamazepine (first generation) and  xxxd2809xxx  (second
generation).  xxxd2034xxx  is a prodrug of eslicarbazepine. it shares similar chemical structure with
carbamazepine and  xxxd2809xxx , but has different
metabolism, low potential for drug interactions,
improved tolerability and is suitable for once-daily dosing (6, 12, 23-25). eslicarbazepine binds to site-2 of inactivated state of vgscs and suppresses the repetitive
neuronal firing. eslicarbazepine has no ability to bind
with benzodiazepine ( xxxd1459xxx ),  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)
or glutamate receptors (23). however, like carbamazepine and  xxxd2809xxx , it inhibits the release of
glutamate, gaba, aspartate and dopamine (24).
similarly, fluorofelbamate is an analogue of  xxxd2090xxx ,
with a structural modification to avoid the toxicity of the
latter compound. the difference from  xxxd2090xxx  is that
the fluorine is substituted for hydrogen in the propanediol moiety. the drug is believed to prevent the formation
of a reactive metabolite, atropaldehyde, responsible for
the toxic effects of  xxxd2090xxx  (26). although fluorofelbamate is reported to decrease the responses to gaba,
kainate and n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda), it also causes a significant reduction in the vgscs (higher than  xxxd2090xxx ). however, these effects are not completely
responsible for its therapeutic effects and other, yet
unexplored mechanisms are believed to play a role in its
anticonvulsant effects (26, 27). elpetrigine, structurally
268

d. vohora et al.

similar to lamotrigine, is currently under clinical evaluation as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. it has
inhibitory effects on both sodium and calcium channels.
it inhibits voltage- and use-dependent blockade of
 xxxg2022xxx  and  xxxg2024xxx , and shows weak inhibition of ttxresistant nav 1.8 and  xxxg2019xxx  sodium channels. the drug
showed a greater selectivity for brain sodium channels
over peripheral ttx-resistant sodium channels, indicating a reduced potential for peripheral adverse effects, an
advantage over lamotrigine. it also inhibited high-voltage calcium channels (n, l, p/q and t-type) (12).
carisbamate is another novel aed that is structurally different from other carbamates ( xxxd2090xxx  and fluorofelbamate) and is currently undergoing phase iii clinical
evaluation. the molecular mechanism of antiepileptic
action of carisbamate has not been fully elucidated but
it is known to cause voltage- and use-dependent blockade of sodium channels in rat hippocampal neurons. in
addition, it blocks an isoform of vgscs ( xxxg2022xxx ), which is
highly expressed in the hippocampus and other regions
of the cns. the broader anticonvulsant profile in various
animal models indicates that the drug may have additional mechanisms that are yet to be explored. however,
it has been shown to be devoid of any effects on potassium channels (28).  xxxd3152xxx , a triazole derivative, is
another drug which is structurally unrelated to aeds. it
is under development as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults and adolescents (29) as well as for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with lennoxgastaut syndrome (lgs) in children and adults, for
which it received fda approval in 2008 (30).  xxxd3152xxx 
reduces the capacity of neuronal sodium channels to
recover from inactivation and limits neuronal sodiumdependent action potential firing. the drug was not
found to affect  xxxd1459xxx , gaba or adenosine uptake and glutamate receptors (13, 30).
 xxxd3158xxx , a derivative of alpha-amino amides, is another
novel sodium and calcium channel blocker with additional  xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b)-inhibiting activity.
the drug is being developed for both parkinsonism and
epilepsy (31). although the antiepileptic actions are
attributed mainly to blockade of sodium channels with
consequent inhibition of glutamate release, mao-b inhibition could also partly contribute to its anticonvulsant
actions (27).
vinpocetine is another third-generation aed with effects
on vgscs. the drug has been found to prevent accumulation of sodium in ischemic neurons by inhibiting vgscs

other drugs with a broader anticonvulsant profile are
 xxxd2436xxx , brivaracetam, fluorofelbamate, elpetrigine
and  xxxd3152xxx . brivaracetam is more potent than  xxxd2466xxx  in animal models of seizures and epilepsy,
which may be due to its additional effects on sodium
channels (12, 42). the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant
efficacy of fluorofelbamate is slightly better than felba-

the preclinical profile of various third-generation sodium-channel blocking aeds is summarized in table ii.
unlike first-generation sodium channel blockers such as
phenytoin and carbamazepine, carisbamate has the
ability to suppress seizures in almost all animal models
tested to date and is effective in the genetic absence
epilepsy rats of strasbourg (gaers) model. similarly,
unlike first- and second-generation sodium channel
blockers such as lamotrigine and topiramate, it is effective against models representing pharmacoresistant
epileptic states, such as the 6-hz model and lamotrigine-resistant model of amygdala kindling (39, 40).
carisbamate also reduces spontaneous motor seizures
in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy more potently than
topiramate (41). thus, this drug possesses a broader
anticonvulsant profile, which is a unique feature.

brivaracetam, chemically related to  xxxd2466xxx , is an
example of a rational drug discovery that began with a
specific molecular target ( xxxg2233xxx ) (9). it has high affinity
(10-fold higher than  xxxd2466xxx ) towards  xxxg2233xxx  protein. although not its primary mechanism, it also has
inhibitory effects on neuronal vgcss. this mechanism of
action has not been detected for  xxxd2466xxx  (38).
brivaracetam is currently undergoing phase iii clinical
trials (12).

models

(32). it is one of the most selective inhibitors of
ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase (pde)
type 1, which maintains levels of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate rather than of cyclic guanosine
monophosphate. furthermore, the drug has been found
to protect neurons from glutamate (33) and nmda toxicity (34). many studies have suggested that vinpocetine
affects gabaergic and serotonergic pathways, peripheral  xxxd1459xxx  receptors, and blocks na+ and ca2+ channels (35,
36). vinpocetine was also found to be more efficacious
and potent when compared with other widely used
aeds. it completely inhibited veratridine-induced neurotransmitter release, including ca2+ channel-mediated
exocytosis of excitatory [3h]-glutamate induced by high
k+ from hippocampal isolated nerve endings (11, 37).

mate in various animal models (table ii) (27, 43). in addition to anticonvulsant effects, it was also demonstrated
to have neuroprotective effects against ischemia and
hypoxia-induced neuronal damage (44). neuroprotective effects were also reported with  xxxd3158xxx  (45),
 xxxd2436xxx  (46) and vinpocetine (47).  xxxd2436xxx  was
demonstrated to have neuroprotective and antiapoptotic effects following glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in
hippocampal slices and in status epilepticus (19).
preclinical efficacy of  xxxd3152xxx  in various animal models was found to be superior to many standard aeds
such as phenytoin, phenobarbital,  xxxd2056xxx  and valproate (48). in addition, anticonvulsant effects (47), vinpocetine has been shown to have nootropic and neuroprotective effects (49, 50). these properties of vinpocetine could be explained by the fact that seizures
reduce cerebral blood flow, leading to central hypoxia,
genesis of free radicals and neuronal cell loss. it confers
neuroprotection by augmenting cerebral blood flow,
exerting a favorable effect on glucose metabolism and
has a significant antioxidant property (35, 50). in addition to its anticonvulsant efficacy (table ii), elpetrigine
was also proved effective in depression and mania (51),
harmaline-induced tremor and in animal models of neuropathic pain (12). lamotrigine was also active in these
models.
currently, all third-generation aeds are undergoing
clinical evaluation and are in various stages of development, except  xxxd2436xxx . this drug was approved in
2008 as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures, and its
postmarketing experience has also been made available
(20). in addition,  xxxd2436xxx  is undergoing clinical evaluation for the pediatric population and in patients with
primary generalized seizures. this drug is also being
evaluated in areas other than epilepsy, such as diabetic
neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and migraine prophylaxis.  xxxd2436xxx  demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive
therapy in refractory partial seizures in three large phase
iib/iii randomized, placebo-controlled trials (12). pooled
data from various trials support its efficacy in a dose
range of 200-600 mg/day. currently, > 90% of patients
who completed the randomized, controlled trials opted
for open-label extension trials for up to 8 years (46).
thus, the long-term efficacy and tolerability would be
ascertained in such patients. a post-marketing surveillance study reported the results of 6 month’s experience
with adjunctive  xxxd2436xxx  in patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. the efficacy was found to be similar to in the controlled clinical trials (20).
270

d. vohora et al.

several late-stage clinical trials have been completed
with  xxxd3152xxx  in patients with partial, generalized
tonic–clonic seizures and with lgs (13). adjunctive  xxxd3152xxx  (400-1600 mg/day) was efficacious in refractory
partial seizures in two multicenter, randomized, doubleblind trials followed by open-label extension studies
(43). furthermore, it was efficacious in children and
adults with lgs, a severe childhood epilepsy syndrome
characterized by inadequately controlled multiple
seizure types and impaired mental development. in lgs,
 xxxd3152xxx  was associated with reduced seizure frequency and severity. it was approved as an orphan drug
for lgs in patients older than 4 years of age. there was
no evidence of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of
 xxxd3152xxx  in open-label extension studies for both
refractory partial seizures lgs (29). recently, the efficacy of  xxxd3152xxx  was also reported in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. the effects were comparable to those in lgs patients, although it was less
effective in patients with partial-onset seizures (30).
another drug which recently completed phase iii trial is
 xxxd2034xxx . it has demonstrated efficacy in
phase ii trials as an adjunctive therapy in refractory partial-onset seizures. recent completion of phase iii, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials at
125 sites in 23 countries has shown its efficacy in simple
and complex partial seizures refractory to other aeds at
doses of 800 and 1200 mg/day. trials are currently
undergoing in children with epilepsy and in patients with
neuropathic pain (6, 12, 44, 52).
currently, phase iii trials are in progress for brivaracetam
and carisbamate. brivaracetam is under clinical assessment for partial-onset seizures and as an add-on treatment for refractory partial-onset seizures in adolescent
and adults. it demonstrated efficacy in phase iib trials in
patients with partial seizures refractory to at least one to
two aeds. it is also under consideration for photosensitive epilepsy. in a phase iia trial, brivaracetam (10-80
mg) suppressed generalized photoparoxysmal electroencephalogram responses in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. currently, it is undergoing phase iii, multicenter trials using different doses (5-100 mg/day) in
epileptic patients with either partial-onset seizures or
generalized seizures inadequately controlled by two to
three aeds (12, 38). carisbamate was also shown to be
efficacious in photosensitive epilepsy at doses of 5001000 mg/day, in a nonrandomized single-blind study.
moreover, it showed efficacy in a phase ii, randomized,
double-blind, dose-ranging study in subjects with partial-onset seizures (39) and also as an adjunct in phase

iib study in refractory epilepsy patients with partial-onset
seizures (300-1600 mg). in preliminary phase iii studies,
the dose of 400 mg was efficacious but not the 200-mg
dose. currently, phase iii trials are in progress to fully
elucidate the long-term effectiveness of carisbamate as
an adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures (12).
another drug that has reached phase iii trials is  xxxd3158xxx , but for parkinsonism, the drug has yet to be
clinically evaluated in epilepsy patients. in an explorative, open-label study in refractory (localization-related) epilepsy,  xxxd3158xxx  was evaluated as an adjunct
with other drugs. the trial was completed in 2003 and
was designed to address tolerability rather than efficacy.
surprisingly, 41% of patients had > 50% reduction in
seizure frequency. randomized, placebo-controlled trials are currently being planned for  xxxd3158xxx  in epilepsy (27, 45).
fluorofelbamate is currently undergoing phase i evaluation (44). a phase i dose-ascending study performed in
male volunteers (7.5-180 mg) indicated no signs of toxicity with this drug (26). in regards to elpetrigine, at present there are only two published clinical reports. the first
study described the effect of drug in decreasing cortical
excitability following transcranial magnetic stimulation
in male healthy volunteers. the second study evaluates
its effects on photosensitive epileptic patients, comparing it with valproate and  xxxd2466xxx , the results of
which have not yet been reported (12). further clinical
studies are being planned with this drug.
vinpocetine has been successfully used for the treatment of cns disorders of cerebrovascular origin, which
may prevent recurrence of convulsive paroxysms and
other neurodegenerative complications. vinpocetine was
found to be most effective in generalized tonic–clonic
convulsions. this has been supported by a few russian
studies. however, clinical trials in different types of
epilepsies are insufficient. in a study in epileptic patients,
20 of 31 had reduced seizure frequency (36), and further
studies of the drug in epileptic patients are warranted.
pharmacokinetics and drug interactions
 xxxd2034xxx  has high bioavailability after
oral administration. it is rapidly metabolized to s-licarbazepine (which is the major metabolite, 95%) by liver
esterases and to minor metabolites ([r]-licarbazepine
and  xxxd2809xxx ) formed by nonmicrosomal
cytochrome p450-mediated metabolism. pharmacokinetics are linear and metabolites are excreted renally.
thomson reuters – drugs of today 2010, 46(4)

recent advances in adjunctive therapy for epilepsy

unlike carbamazepine,  xxxd2034xxx  does not
induce its own metabolism or is susceptible to enzyme
induction because it does not form a 10,11-epoxide
metabolite.  xxxd2809xxx  is metabolized to both  xxxd2034xxx  and (r)-licarbazepine (23, 53, 54).
furthermore,  xxxd2034xxx  has no inhibitory
effects on cytochrome p450 isoenzymes (cyp1a2,
 xxxg582xxx ,  xxxg583xxx , cyp2d6,  xxxg589xxx , cyp3a4, and
cyp2c9), but it has a moderate inhibitory effect on
cyp2c19. this drug also has a mild inducing effect on
cyp2c9.  xxxd2034xxx  does not alter the
plasma drug concentrations of carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine,  xxxd2466xxx , topiramate, phenobarbital, gabapentin,  xxxd1718xxx  or valproate. thus, no dose
adjustments are required on concurrent administration
with these drugs. similarly, the plasma drug concentration of  xxxd2034xxx  is not affected by the
presence of warfarin, diazepam, phenytoin and  xxxd3394xxx  (6, 12, 23, 53, 54). recently, it was reported that
 xxxd2034xxx  has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (54).
brivaracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed
after oral administration. the metabolism of brivaracetam includes hydrolysis of the  xxxd63xxx  group and
hydroxylation by liver microsomal cytochrome p450. the
metabolite is not active but has high renal clearance,
with 90% of dose recovered in urine after 72 h of administration (55). thus, the compound is primarily excreted
as the metabolite. while brivaracetam was reported to
weakly induce cyp3a4 in vitro, recent evidence showed
no induction of cyp3a4 activity following brivaracetam
administration to healthy male subjects at 200-800
mg/day, suggesting a low potential for drug interactions. in addition, no alteration of plasma levels of carbamazepine, lamotrigine,  xxxd2466xxx ,  xxxd2809xxx ,
topiramate, phenytoin or valproate was observed following concurrent administration with brivaracetam.
however, with carbamazepine, the metabolite carbamazepine epoxide was significantly increased (12, 56).
carisbamate is well absorbed orally with a bioavailability of > 94%. it is extensively metabolized through o-glucuronidation and hydrolysis of the carbamate ester followed by oxidation (57). the reactive intermediate
atropaldehyde, associated with toxicity of the dicarbamate  xxxd2090xxx , was not found (12). moreover, carisbamate exhibits minimal hepatic first-pass metabolism
with a half-life (t1/2) of 12 h, enabling twice-daily dosing
(39). carisbamate did not have a significant effect on the
activity of cyp2c9, cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 enzymes and
271

recent advances in adjunctive therapy for epilepsy

produced no clinically significant changes in the plasma
concentrations of concurrently administered aeds such
as lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine, or other drugs
such as oral contraceptives, warfarin and alcohol (12).
however, the plasma concentration of carisbamate was
reduced following administration with carbamazepine or
with oral contraceptives possibly due to induction of glucuronidation (58).
 xxxd2436xxx , which is rapidly and completely absorbed,
has a high oral bioavailability. peak plasma concentration (tmax) occurs 1-4 h after oral administration, while its
t1/2 is 13 h, allowing twice-daily dosing. a small portion is
metabolized to inactive o-desmethyl metabolite. both
 xxxd2436xxx  and its metabolite are excreted renally (46).
because of minimal protein binding, risk for displacement drug interactions is low. furthermore,  xxxd2436xxx 
does not affect the plasma levels of concurrently administered aeds such as  xxxd2466xxx , lamotrigine, carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate and phenytoin (46, 59)
or affects the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, metformin
and oral contraceptives (46). it is neither an inducer nor
an inhibitor of cyp450 isoenzymes, although it inhibits
cyp2c19 in vitro at higher concentrations (46).
 xxxd3152xxx  is well absorbed after oral administration
and is extensively metabolized. the most important
metabolite is a carboxylic acid derivative formed by
hydrolysis of the carboxyl amide group of  xxxd3152xxx .
this metabolite is inactive. most of the elimination of
 xxxd3152xxx  is through metabolism, which uses a mechanism that is cyp450-independent. renal excretion
accounts for < 2% of the dose (29, 44).  xxxd3152xxx 
shows weak induction of cyp3a4 and thus can induce
metabolism of other drugs (29). it may increase the concentration of phenytoin, while valproate may lead to elevated  xxxd3152xxx  levels in children (44).  xxxd3152xxx  can
also increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by
cyp3a4 such as  xxxd2054xxx ,  xxxd2751xxx  and triazolam (29).
 xxxd3158xxx  exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. the drug is
89% bound to plasma proteins, whereas its metabolites
are inactive and are found in plasma and urine.
 xxxd3158xxx  has a long t1/2 (24 h), which makes it suitable
for once-daily administration. however, concurrent
administration of enzyme-inducing aeds reduces its t1/2
to 16 h (27).  xxxd3158xxx  does not affect plasma concentrations of carbamazepine,  xxxd2908xxx , valproate
and lamotrigine. in addition, in vitro experiments
showed no relevant enzyme-inducing or -inhibiting
272

action for cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6,  xxxg589xxx  and
cyp3a4 (31, 45).
detailed pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs
revealed high bioavailability for fluorofelbamate (27).
the tmax ranged between 2 and 6 h, and urinary excretion
is the primary route of elimination (6). hepatic and
hematological (rare aplastic anemia) toxicity of  xxxd2090xxx  is thought to be due to the production of a reactive
metabolite (atropaldehyde) produced from 3-carbamoyl-2-phenylprionaldeyde. fluorofelbamate, however, utilizes a different metabolic pathway and does not
lead to formation of this reactive metabolite (26).
oral bioavailability of vinpocetine was found to be
approximately 55% and the presence of food hastened
its absorption; the drug reached the bloodstream within
1 h and was readily and highly up taken by the cns in
both animals and human subjects. the main metabolite,
free apovincaminic acid, is rapidly formed and its elimination t1/2 is reported to be 1-2 h (36, 60). vinpocetine
should be cautiously used along with blood thinners like
warfarin (61).
elpetrigine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration
and readily eliminated as o-glucuronidated hydroxyl
metabolites in urine (12, 44). it has no inhibitory effect on
 xxxg589xxx  and very weak inhibitory effects on  xxxg582xxx ,
cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6 and cyp3a4. it has very low
potential for affecting the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered drugs, and it does not act as an
enzyme inducer (12).
adverse events
commonly encountered aes for new-generation aeds
are listed in table iii.  xxxd2034xxx  was generally well tolerated. the aes reported were mild to moderate and included dizziness, somnolence, nausea,
diplopia, headache, ataxia and vertigo. the incidence of
rash and hyponatremia was low (an advantage over carbamazepine) (12, 52). although the incidence of skin
rash is less frequent with  xxxd2809xxx , hyponatremia
is reported to be more common with administration of
this drug (62). the aes were reported to occur within the
first few weeks of treatment only. no significant behavioral or psychiatric adverse events were observed (12,
52).
brivaracetam was well tolerated by healthy male volunteers at 200-800 mg/day and also as adjunctive
therapy in partial-onset seizures. aes were mostly
mild to moderate, including dizziness and somnolence.

other aes were nausea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis,
anorexia and insomnia. ataxia was not reported even at
the highest dose (12, 56).
carisbamate had excellent tolerability at the dose of
300 mg. the most common aes reported were mild and
related to the cns, including headache, dizziness, somnolence and nausea (39). elevations of serum alanine
aminotransferase occurred in some subjects at higher
dose ranges (800 and 1600 mg) (12). another drug that
displayed excellent tolerability in clinical trials was
 xxxd2436xxx . the most common aes reported were either
of the cns or gastrointestinal tract were mild to moderate in severity and included dizziness, headache, ataxia,
vomiting, nystagmus and diplopia. no clinically
important changes in vital signs were reported except
for a small increase in p-r interval in electrocardiogram (ecg) (46). post-marketing experience in 25
patients showed that 2 patients lost > 10% of body
weight (20).
the most common aes reported with  xxxd3152xxx  were
headache, dizziness, fatigue and somnolence. vomiting
and rash were also observed in patients with lgs. no
cognitive dysfunction, hepatotoxicity, steven-johnson
syndrome or agranulocytosis was reported following
drug administration (29, 44). however, some serious
hypersensitivity reactions, lymphadenopathy and liver
function abnormalities were reported in children. all
patients developing rash following the drug were
advised to be followed closely. status epilepticus
was also reported in a few patients (29). no serious aes
were reported in a recent european study (30).

testinal problems; nonetheless, these side effects did not
warrant discontinuation of the medication (61).
vinpocetine was generally found to be safe during longterm administration. considering the fact that both
epilepsy per se and prolonged medication of the commonly used aeds cause hearing deficits and parallel
cognitive impairment, the added advantage with vinpocetine is its ability to improve cognitive function in
experimental animals, as well as in healthy human volunteers, and prevent hearing loss (47, 49).
conclusions
the newer aeds act on diverse and novel molecular targets. nevertheless, inhibition of vgscs continues to be
an effective strategy for the development of second- and
third-generation aeds. many of the third-generation
compounds are currently undergoing clinical evaluation,
and some are even approved and marketed (e.g.,
 xxxd2436xxx ). the third-generation drugs offer various
favorable properties such as broad-spectrum efficacy,
and many have demonstrated efficacy mainly in refractory partial seizures. in addition,  xxxd3152xxx  has proved
to be efficacious in idiopathic generalized epilepsy and
lgs. some aeds possess neuroprotective effects in
addition to the antiepileptic effects, for example,  xxxd3158xxx ,  xxxd2436xxx  and vinpocetine. some-third generation compounds, such as  xxxd3158xxx ,  xxxd2436xxx ,
elpetrigine and  xxxd2034xxx  have demonstrated potential in indications other than epilepsy and
are undergoing further evaluations.

 xxxd3158xxx  was reported to have a good safety profile. no
clinically relevant changes in ecg or hematological tests
were reported (45). clinical trials with fluorofelbamate
are in progress and adverse events associated with this
drug have yet to be reported. in toxicological studies in
rats, it was found to be devoid of neurological toxicities at
doses below 500 mg/kg. tests for qtc prolongation and
genotoxicity tests were also negative (27). like fluorofelbamate, aes have yet to be evaluated in clinical trials for
elpetrigine. it was negative in genotoxicity, mutagenicity,
fertility and teratogenicity tests. ataxia and sedation
were observed at higher toxic doses in animal studies.
compared to lamotrigine, it demonstrated a wider margin of safety in purkinje fiber studies (44).

in general, the third-generation compounds have shown
excellent tolerability and/or milder adverse effects, an
improved pharmacokinetic profile and/ or lesser drug
interactions as compared to the older aeds.
nevertheless, the efficacy of the third-generation drugs
in specific forms of epilepsy and the long-term consequences of these drugs, along with information concerning their teratogenicity, are not presently known. as the
majority of the epileptic patients need to take drugs for
several years, additional clinical studies are required to
determine the long-term adverse effects of these drugs.

like other nootropics, vinpocetine is devoid of any aes on
the cns. however, in some subjects, the administration
of vinpocetine led to flushing, rashes or minor gastroin-

assistance by university grants commission (ugc), new
delhi under its special assistance programme (sap) is
