ethnic differences in beta-1-adrenoceptor sensitivity.  in the light of reports that beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs seem to be ineffective in black hypertensives, the effects of  xxxd2869xxx  on exercise-induced tachycardia were assessed in 6 black and 6 white healthy volunteers. after a standardized breakfast at 08h00 the subjects received either intravenous  xxxd2869xxx  or placebo at 08h45, on a randomized double-blind basis. at each test session subjects were exercised for 5 minutes on a bicycle ergometer, the load predetermined to increase their heart rates to +/- 130/min. recordings, spaced at 30-minute intervals, commenced 45 minutes after the injection. the results indicate that black volunteers require a higher dose of  xxxd2869xxx  than whites to achieve a similar degree of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. it also appears that the maximal response is lower in blacks.
