the novel progestin  xxxd1946xxx  and
its natural counterpart progesterone:
biochemical profile and
antiandrogenic
potential

 xxxd1946xxx  is a novel progestin under clinical development that is similar to the natural hormone progesterone,
combining potent progestogenic with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activities. this specific pharmacological profile of  xxxd1946xxx  is defined by its pattern of
binding affinities to a variety of steroid hormone receptors.
in the present study the affinity of  xxxd1946xxx  to the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr), the  xxxg183xxx  (ar), the
 xxxg1601xxx  (gr), the mineralocorticoid
receptor (mr), and the  xxxg730xxx  (er) was re-evaluated
by steroid binding assays and compared to those obtained
for the natural hormone progesterone.
 xxxd1946xxx 
displayed high affinity to pr and mr and low binding to ar,
similar to progesterone.
unlike progesterone,
which
showed considerable binding to gr,  xxxd1946xxx  exhibited only low binding to this receptor. neither  xxxd1946xxx  nor progesterone did bind to the er. in addition to
receptor binding studies, transactivation
assays were carried out to investigate ,the effects of  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone on ar-, gr-, and mr-mediated
induction of
transcription.
both progestins showed no androgenic but
antiandrogenic
activity by inhibiting ar-mediated
transcription in a dose-dependent manner. this observation
could be confirmed by in vivo experiments carried out with
orchiectomized
male rats, where the antiandrogenic potency of  xxxd1946xxx  was found to be about five- to tenfold higher than that of progesterone. in contrast to progesterone,  xxxd1946xxx  was devoid of glucocorticoid activity.
both progestins did not show any antiglucocorticoid
action. furthermore,
 xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone both
showed considerable antimineralocorticoid
activity and
weak mineralocorticoid
activity.

introduction
(bf3,7p,15p,lgf%dimethylene-30x0-1 7a-pregn-4-ene-21,17
carbolactone) is a
novel progestin under clinical development.
structurally,
the compound is different from all currently available progestogens in that it is derived from
spironolactone
but not from 19-nortestosterone
or
progesterone. ‘j the pharmacological
characterization of  xxxd1946xxx  revealed that this progestin exhibits a pharmacological
profile very similar to the
natural hormone progesterone.3  xxxd1946xxx 
combines potent progestogenic
with antimineralocorticoid4j5 and antiandrogenic
activities.3
in order to
obtain additional
information
about the pharmacological profile of  xxxd1946xxx , we carried out a broad
biochemical
characterization
of this compound
in
comparison to the natural hormone progesterone. we,
therefore, investigated
the interaction
of  xxxd1946xxx  with the classical steroid hormone receptors by
competition
experiments.
receptor binding was reevaluated for the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr), the  xxxg183xxx  (ar), the glucocorticoid
receptor
(gr), the mineralocorticoid
receptor (mr), and the
 xxxg730xxx  (er). furthermore,
the steroid agonistic and antagonistic
properties of this progestin
were evaluated in vitro by transactivation
assays
forar, gr, and mr. the transactivation
assay assumes that steroid receptor proteins act as ligandregulated transcriptional
activators.
after binding

the steroid
receptor

elements (hres) of hormoneregulated genes, thereby inducing a cascade of transcriptional
events.6 the hormone-dependent

in tissue
culture by transfection of the steroid receptor under
investigation
and a reporter gene linked to a hormonally responsive promoter into cells. this transactiva-

of the agonistic but also the antagonistic
potency of a given
compound,

of reporter gene activity.’ the results of the receptor binding studies and the transactivation
assays are discussed in comparison
to data on receptor affinities
published earlier’ and with regard to the pharmacodynamic profile of  xxxd1946xxx  observed in vivo.3 in
addition to the ar transactivation
assay, we carried
out in vivo studies with orchiectomized
male rats,
since comparative
in vitro and in vivo studies on the
antiandrogenic
potencies of  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone were not available.

receptor

binding

studies

steroid binding assays were carried out to determine
the receptor-binding
affinities of  xxxd1946xxx  and
progesterone using cytosol fractions of steroid  xxxg1603xxx -containing
tissue of the rat (ar, gr,
er, mr) or rabbit (pr). the relative binding affinity
(rba) of the two progestins was determined in competition
experiments,
using radioactive
standard
compounds as reference. the rba values of reference
compounds were arbitrarily set at 100%. the results
are summarized in table 1.  xxxd1946xxx  exhibited
high binding affinity to the rabbit pr (rba value:
40%). in comparison to the rba value of  xxxd1946xxx , the rba value of progesterone was slightly
higher (100%). both progestins showed very low affinity to the rat prostate ar as documented by the

0.6% rba values for  xxxd1946xxx  and 1.4% for progesterone. the 11% rba value of progesterone indicated considerable affinity of this progestin to the rat
thymus gr, whereas  xxxd1946xxx  exhibited only low
binding affinity (rba value: 1%) to this receptor. both
compounds bound with high affinity to the rat hippocampus mr.  xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone
showed similar high affinity to the rat mr; this affinity was similar to the reference compound aldosterone (rba value: 100%). neither  xxxd1946xxx  nor
progesterone bound to the rat er.

transactivation

assays

since  xxxd1946xxx  shows affinity to the ar, the gr,
and the mr, we were interested in investigating the
effects of this progestin on ar-, gr-, and mrmediated induction
of transcription,
in order to
obtain additional information about the pharmacological profile of this compound. the effects of
 xxxd1946xxx  on receptor-mediated
reporter gene
transcription were compared with those of the natural progestin, progesterone.

cells, stably transfected with the rat ar (rar) and a
reporter plasmid containing the mouse mammary
tumor virus promoter (pmmtv-cat)
were used.’ armediated agonistic activity was investigated by treating these cells with increasing amounts of either
 xxxd1946xxx  or progesterone, as illustrated
in figure
1a. as a positive control for ar-mediated
reporter
gene induction,
cells were cultured in the presence of
the synthetic androgen r188 1. to study ar-mediated
inhibition
of reporter gene induction,
cells were
treated with 0.5 nmol/l  xxxd2631xxx  and, in addition, with
increasing amounts of  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone,
respectively.
the antiandrogen
 xxxd1786xxx 
was used as positive control for reporter gene inhibition. as shown in figure 1a, neither  xxxd1946xxx  nor
progesterone
showed androgenic
activity.
furthermore,  xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone both inhibited
ar-mediated
transcription
in a dose-dependent manner, progesterone
being the stronger antiandrogen
(figure 1b).
cv-1 cells transiently
transfected with the human
gr (phg0) and pmmtv-cat
served to determine
the glucocorticoid
and antiglucocorticoid
action of
 xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone.
transiently
transfected cv-1 cells were treated with dexamethasone
(dex) as a positive control for gr-mediated
reporter
gene transcription
(figure 2a). the antiprogestin
ru486, which is known to exhibit antiglucocorticoid
action, was used as a positive control for cat inhibition (figure 2b). in contrast to  xxxd1946xxx , which
showed no glucocorticoid
activity, progesterone exhibited weak glucocorticoid
action (figure 2a). as
can be seen in figure 2b, both compounds showed no
gr-mediated
antagonistic
activity.
finally, mineralocorticoid
and antimineralocorticoid activity of  xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone was
investigated
by transiently
transfecting
the human
mr (prshmr) and pmmtv-cat
into cos 1 cells.
as a positive control for mr-mediated
cat induction, the transiently transfected cos 1 cells were cultured in the presence of the mineralocorticoid
aldosterone (figure 3a). as a positive control for reporter
gene inhibition,
the antimineralocorticoid
zk 9 1 587
was used (figure 3b).  xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone
both inhibited
the aldosterone-induced
cat activity
(figure 3b). in addition, both compounds weakly induced reporter gene transcription
(figure 3a).
antiandrogenic
activity in vivo
in order to evaluate the antiandrogenic
activity of
 xxxd1946xxx 
and the natural hormone progesterone
in vivo, a comparative
study was performed in juvenile castrated male rats. substitution
of the castrated
rats with  xxxd3327xxx  caused stimulation

1996;54:243-251

of seminal vesicle and prostate growth, as documented by three- to fourfold increases in organ fresh
weight compared to control animals treated with vehicle only (figure 4). increasing
doses of both
 xxxd1946xxx  (0.1 to 10 mg/animal/day,
s.c.) and progesterone (0.3 to 30 mg/animal/day,
s.c.) caused a
dose-dependent inhibition
of testosterone-stimulated
growth of seminal vesicles and prostates. the antiandrogenic potency of  xxxd1946xxx 
was found to be
five- to tenfold higher than that of progesterone.

discussion
one aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive biochemical
profile of  xxxd1946xxx 
and
the natural progestin, progesterone,
regarding their
interactions with all classical steroid hormone receptors. besides the determination
of the rba to the five
classical steroid receptors, transcription
activation assays were performed to elucidate the agonistic and
antagonistic
properties of the two progestins under
study for those receptors-with
the exception of the
pr-for
which the compounds exhibited detectable
binding affinity. a second aim was to carry out a comparative investigation
in vivo and in vitro of the antiandrogenic
potential of  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone. in vivo, the antiandrogenic
activity of the two
compounds
was investigated
in juvenile
castrated
male rats and in vitro by receptor binding and transactivation experiments.
 xxxg183xxx  binding and antiandrogenic
activity
receptor binding studies with ar-containing
cytosol
preparations
from rat prostate revealed that both
 xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone exhibited low affinity
to the rat ar (rba value: 0.6% and 1.4%, respectively; table 1). higher affinity of  xxxd1946xxx  to rat
ar was reported recently (rba value: 65%).’ in the
same study, the rba of progesterone was reported to
be below 0.1%. the reason for these variations in the
binding affinities are unclear.
transactivation
assays carried out in cv- 1 cells stably transfected with the rat ar and an androgenregulated reporter gene revealed that both  xxxd1946xxx  and the natural progestin progesterone
were
devoid of androgenic activity (figure 1a). the two
progestins rather exhibited
considerable
antiandrogenie activity (figure 1b). surprisingly, the activity of
progesterone was only slightly lower than that of the
reference antiandrogen
 xxxd1786xxx . in agreement with the in vitro results, progesterone
and
 xxxd1946xxx 
were shown to be lacking androgenic
activity in vivo. 3~i7 furthermore,

4. antiandrogenic activity of  xxxd1946xxx  ( xxxd1946xxx ) and progesterone in castrated  xxxd3327xxx  (tp)treated juvenile male rats. animals were treated for 7 days by daily subcutaneous administration with 0.1 mg/animal/day
 xxxd3327xxx  in 0.1 ml vehicle either alone or in combination with increasing dosesof  xxxd1946xxx  (0.1, 1, or 10
mg/animal/day in 0.2 ml vehicle) or progesterone(0.3,3, or 30 mg/animal/day in 0.2 ml vehicle), respectively. as a negative
control, animals were treated with 0.1 ml vehicle only. seminal vesicle and prostate weight were determined. data
correspond to mean values + standard deviation; n = 6 animals/group.

showed high antiandrogenic

activity

in castrated tes-

tosterone-substituted
male rats (figure 4). in contrast
to the in vitro experiments, in which progesterone
was more potent than  xxxd1946xxx , in vivo  xxxd1946xxx  exhibited five- to tenfold higher antiandrogenic

activity than progesterone.
whereas the antiandrogenie potency of  xxxd1946xxx  was about one-seventh
of that of  xxxd1786xxx  in vitro, its antiandrogenie activity in vivo was found to be about one-third
of that of  xxxd1786xxx .3 the inverse relationship of the relative

antiandrogenic

potencies

of

 xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone in vitro and in vivo
could be explained by differences in the metabolic
stability of the two compounds.  xxxd1946xxx 
exhibits a higher metabolic
stability than the natural progestin progesterone.3
interaction with other steroid hormone receptors
the relative binding affinity of  xxxd1946xxx  to the

rabbit uterus pr used in our studies was found to be
40% when compared to progesterone, whose affinity
was set to 100% (table 1). a similar rba value (66%)

was reported earlier for human uterus pr.8 the high
binding affinity is reflected by high progestogenic activity in vivo. the progestogenic potency was investigated in rats (maintenance
of pregnancy) and rabbits
(endometrial
transformation),
and was found to be
about threefold higher compared to progesterone3
(krattenmacher,
personal communication)
and was in
the same range as that of  xxxd1786xxx , a compound exhibiting similar binding affinity to the rabbit
pr as  xxxd1946xxx 
(rba value: 50%; fritzemeier,
personal communication)
and  xxxd2751xxx 
acetate3
(rba value of the active metabolite
 xxxd2751xxx :
200%; fritzemeier,
personal communication).
in addition, the antiovulatory
potency in rats was comparable to the antiovulatory
potency determined
for
 xxxd2751xxx 
acetate.2
 xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone exhibited low binding affinities to the rat gr as is documented by 1%
and 11% rba values compared to the reference dexamethasone, respectively.
similar results were reported elsewhere.8 in accordance with the low affin-

ity to the gr, progesterone

and  xxxd1946xxx 

showed

250

fuhrmann

et al

weak or no detectable agonistic activities, respectively, in the gr-dependent transactivation
assay
(figure 2a and figure 2b). furthermore, both progestins were devoid of antiglucocorticoid
activity
in
vitro. these data are in agreement with in vivo studies carried out with rats where  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone showed neither glucocorticoid nor antiglucocorticoid activity.8
 xxxd1946xxx  does not exhibit detectable affinity to
rat (table 1) and human’ uterus er. in accordance
with the lack of er binding affinity, the compound
does not exhibit estrogenic activity in animal studies.8
one characteristic of  xxxd1946xxx  is its high binding affinity to the rat hippocampus mr (rba value:
100%; table 1). high affinity was also found for human mr overexpressed in cos 1 cells (rba value:
167%; fritzemeier,
personal communication).
a
similarly high affinity to the mr is exhibited by progesterone (rba value: 100% for rat mr; table 1, and
200% for human mr; fritzemeier, personal communication). in agreement with these data, high affinity
of  xxxd1946xxx  for rat kidney mr was reported recently.8 the transactivation assays based on transient
co-transfection of the human mr and the mineralocorticoid-regulated mmtv reporter gene into cos 1
cells revealed that the high affinity of  xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone to the mr are reflected by considerable antimineralocorticoid
activity in vitro. in addition, the two progestins showed marginal agonistic
activity in this in vitro assay. the antimineralocorticoid activity was also analyzed in the rat distal colon
in vitro, where both compounds were shown to inhibit aldosterone-stimulated
transepithelial sodium
transport.5 in studies with adrenalectomized, aldosterone-substituted rats,  xxxd1946xxx  could be shown to
be a potent antimineralocorticoid
without agonistic
properties in vivo. in this respect the new synthetic
progestin is again similar to the natural hormone progesterone which also exhibits antimineralocorticoid
activity in vitro and in vivo.18
in conclusion, the biochemical profile of  xxxd1946xxx  emerging from receptor binding studies and
transactivation
assays is in full agreement with the
pharmacological profile of this new progestin as demonstrated by in vivo studies with various animal experiments.  xxxd1946xxx  is a novel progestin with antimineralocorticoid
and antiandrogenic activity. it is
devoid of any androgenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid,
and antiglucocorticoid
activity. therefore, the biochemical and pharmacological profile of this compound closely resembles the natural hormone progesterone.
