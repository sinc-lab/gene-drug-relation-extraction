characterization of a novel thermostable o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from aeropyrum pernix k1.  an o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (oass) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon aeropyrum pernix k1, which shares the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding motif with both oass and  xxxg350xxx  (cbs), was cloned and expressed by using escherichia coli rosetta(de3). the purified protein was a dimer and contained pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. it was shown to be an enzyme with cbs activity as well as oass activity in vitro. the enzyme retained 90% of its activity after a 6-h incubation at 100 degrees c. in the  xxxd5xxx  sulfhydrylation reaction, it had a ph optimum of 6.7, apparent k(m) values for  xxxd5xxx  and sulfide of 28 and below 0.2 mm, respectively, and a rate constant of 202 s(-1). in the l-cystathionine synthetic reaction, it showed a broad ph optimum in the range of 8.1 to 8.8, apparent k(m) values for l-serine and l-homocysteine of 8 and 0.51 mm, respectively, and a rate constant of 0.7 s(-1). a. pernix oass has a high activity in the l-cysteine desulfurization reaction, which produces sulfide and s-(2,3-hydroxy-4-thiobutyl)-l-cysteine from l-cysteine and dithiothreitol.
