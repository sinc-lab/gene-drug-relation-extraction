summary: the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the inhibitors of different pde isoenzymes
(pde 1–5) on the production of two pro-inflammatory cytokines –  xxxg2296xxx  alpha (tnf) and
 xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf). two in vitro models were used to compare the
antiinflammatory properties of pde inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. the effect on tnf release from diluted
human blood following lipopolysaccharide (lps from salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the  xxxg526xxx  and tnf release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. both models
proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities.
in diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced tnf release was most potently
suppressed by selective pde4 inhibitors.  xxxd2341xxx  and milrinone, selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors, suppressed tnf
secretion to a lesser extent. the effects of theophylline (unspecific pde inhibitor), vinpocetine (pde1 inhibitor),
 xxxd1974xxx  (pde2 inhibitor) and the pde5 inhibitors zaprinast and e 4021 were weak. in human blood, the tested
glucocorticoids beclomethasone, dexamethasone and fluticasone inhibited the lps induced tnf release potently
in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in dispersed human nasal polyp cells, the effect of the glucocorticoids
on allergically induced tnf release, with the exception of dexamethasone, was much less pronounced. glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of gm-csf release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to
the  xxxg1601xxx . the selective pde 4 inhibitors, and to a certain extent the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors  xxxd2341xxx 
and milrinone, reduced the gm-csf release in a concentration dependent manner. in all investigations selective
pde4 inhibitors reduced tnf release to a much higher degree (4–10 fold) than gm-csf release.

tnf is a potent early pro-inflammatory cytokine
and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
septic shock1 and chronic inflammatory conditions,
such as rheumatoid arthritis,2 chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (copd)3–5 and inflammatory bowel
diseases, i.e. colitis ulcerosa and crohn’s disease.6–8
considerable evidence has accumulated suggesting
that tnf upregulation occurs in asthmatic subjects,
especially in those with severe acute symptoms. analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid studies
has revealed that more cells express tnf mrna
when compared to those of normal subjects.9 mast

introduction
within the last couple of years the roles of two potent
pro-inflammatory mediators were elucidated which
play – beside others – an important role in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation:  xxxg2296xxx  alpha (tnf) and granulocyte-macrophage
 xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf).

cells, eosinophils, macrophages and monocytes have
been considered as a major source of tnf.10–12 other
cell types including peripheral blood lymphocytes and
granulocytes are capable of producing measurable
levels of tnf in response to various stimuli.1 lipopolysaccharide (lps) is the most potent stimulus of
the tnf production in human blood.13,14
gm-csf is a cytokine of the glycoprotein family
and acts as a potent growth factor both in vitro and
in vivo, stimulating proliferation and maturation of
myeloid progenitor cells, giving rise to neutrophil and
eosinophil granulocytes and monocytes.15,16 gm-csf
also activates the corresponding mature cells.17  xxxg526xxx  is chemotactic for eosinophils and influences the
migration behaviour of these cells in response to other
chemotactic factors.18 moreover, the cytotoxicity of
eosinophils is enhanced considerably by gm-csf.
since gm-csf is produced by cells present at sites
of inflammatory responses (t-lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) it is considered
to be an important mediator for inflammatory reactions.19 beside others, the airway epithelial cells,20,21
eosinophils22 and smooth muscle cells23 produce remarkable amounts of gm-csf and contribute to
maintenance of the inflammation.
searching for alternative antiinflammatory treatment, selective pde4 inhibitors have received a considerable amount of attention because they suppress
the functions of several cell types implicated in inflammation and may be useful alternative therapeutic
agents to corticoids.24,25 in recent years the distribution
and role of pde isoenzymes in inflammatory cells
was extensively investigated.26 pde4 was found to be
the predominant  xxxd1773xxx -metabolizing isoenzyme
family in immune and inflammatory cells and the first
selective pde4 inhibitors are in late clinical trials27,28
submitted for asthma and copd. in general, elevation
of camp leads to a suppression of inflammatory
responses in leukocytes, such as mediator release and
proliferation.29
the aim of this study was to investigate the role of
the inhibitors of the diﬀerent pde isoenzymes (types
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) on the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. in our experiments we compared the antiinflammatory properties of pde inhibitors with that
of glucocorticoids in two in vitro models. thus, we
investigated the eﬀect on tnf release from diluted
human blood following lps stimulation as well as
the gm-csf and tnf release from human nasal
polyp cells following allergic stimulation.
the evaluation of the antiinflammatory properties
of new compounds using leukocytes isolated from
human blood or whole blood preparations is a common method. samples of blood are easily obtained
and various stimuli can be used to provoke mediator
release.30 nasal polyps represent a model of chronic
respiratory mucosal inflammation.31 not only residing

cells such as epithelial cells, monocytes, macrophages,
and mast cells are contained in this cell culture; but
also infiltrated cells such as immunocompetent lymphocytes, neutrophil and often a high amount of
eosinophil granulocytes can be found. hence, this
culture system ensures an intensive interplay between
the diﬀerent cell populations, thereby providing a
suitable model to study the pharmacologic action of
anti-inflammatory and anti-asthmatic drugs.32–35

materials and methods
this study was approved by the ethics committee of
the university of dresden and informed consent was
obtained from each patient.
lps-induced tnf-release in human whole blood
citrated peripheral venous blood (10 ml) obtained
from human donors was diluted 1:5 with rpmi 1640
containing 2% fcs (fetal calf serum, heat inactivated),
2 mmol/l l-glutamine, 25 mmol/l hepes, 100 u/ml
penicillin,
100 g/ml
streptomycin.
lipopolysaccharide (lps) from salmonella abortus equi,
dissolved in 0.1% hydroxylamine/pbs-solution and
sonicated for 5 minutes, was added to reach a final
concentration of 10 g/ml to stimulate tnf-release
from leukocytes. vehicle (dmso at a final concentration of 0.1%) or compounds (dissolved in
dmso) were administered at diﬀerent concentrations.
the specimens (0.9 ml diluted blood and 0.1 ml compound or vehicle) were incubated for 24 h at 37°c in
a 5% co2 atmosphere and then centrifuged at 3000 g
for 1 min. the supernatants were stored at −70°c
until determination of tnf contents.
recovery of human nasal polyp cells
nasal polyps were obtained from patients with nasal
polyposis after polypectomy. patients had been free
of any medication for at least 2 weeks before surgery.
the polyps were washed in rpmi 1640 (biochrom,
germany), dissected and cell disaggregation was
achieved by enzymatic digestion according to
campbell and bousquet.36 briefly, the minced polyps
were incubated for 2 h at 37°c in rpmi 1640
(1 g tissue/4 ml culture medium) containing 2.0 mg/ml
protease, 1.5 mg/ml collagenase, 0.75 mg/ml hyaluronidase and 0.05 mg/ml dnase (all enzymes
sigma). then, the cell suspension was filtered to remove any undigested tissue and the cells were washed
3 times. after an incubation in the presence of human
ige (1 g/ml in rpmi 1640/10% fcs, biochrom) for
1 h at 37°c, the cells were washed two times, counted
and resuspended at a concentration of 2×106

modulation of tnf and gm-csf release

cells/ml. the cell suspension (1 ml per well in 6 well
plates) was preincubated with the compounds (pde
inhibitors or glucocorticoids) or with vehicle (0.1%
dmso) for 30 min prior to addition of 1 g anti-ige
antibodies (calbiochem) per well. after an incubation
period of 18 h (37°c and 5% co2) the cell suspension
was centrifuged and the supernatant was stored at
−70°c until determination of cytokine contents.
viability and differentiation of cells
after enzymatic disaggregation, cells were counted in
a neubauer chamber using trypan blue staining. cell
viability always exceeded 95 %.
for cell diﬀerentiation, cells were spun down onto
glass slides by a cyto-centrifuge eppendorf 5403 (eppendorf, hamburg, germany) for 5 min at 30 g. afterwards, the cells were stained with may-grünwald stain
and diﬀerentiated microscopically (data not shown).

cytokine determination
tnf and gm-csf were determined by elisa performed in flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates
(greiner, frickenhausen, germany). all antibodies
were purchased from pharmingen (hamburg, germany). the plates were coated overnight with monoclonal mouse-anti human antibody directed against
tnf or gm-csf, respectively. then the unspecific
binding sites were blocked with 10% fcs in pbs for
30 min. 100 l of the samples or the standard protein
(human recombinant tnf or gm-csf, respectively)
were incubated for 4 h and afterwards the detection
antibody (biotinylated monoclonal mouse-anti human
tnf or gm-csf, respectively, 1 h) and avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:400 for tnf
or 1:300 for gm-csf, 30 min) were added successively. between each step, the plates were washed
3–8 times with pbs/tween. a solution of 0.01% abts
(2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid,
sigma aldrich chemie, steinheim, germany) and
0.01% h2o2 was used as substrate for the enzyme.
after 40–60 min of colour development at room temperature the extinction at 405 nm was measured using
a digiscan 340 reader (asys hitech gmbh, eugendorf, austria) and the corresponding cytokine concentrations in the samples were calculated by the
digiscan microwin software package.

results
in this study we investigated the eﬀects of various
pde-isoenzyme inhibitors as well as the eﬀect of
glucocorticoids on tnf and gm-csf generation
from allergically sensitised human nasal polyp cells
and lps-induced tnf release in 1:5 diluted human
blood.
in human whole blood the lps stimulation caused
tnf levels from 255.9±125 pg/ml (control level) to
4159.6±1089 pg/ml in non-atopic patients and from
294.3±92 pg/ml (control level) to 7373.3±1910 pg/ml
in atopic patients 24 h after the provocation. the nonspecific pde inhibitor theophylline suppressed the
tnf release at the highest tested concentration of
300 mol/l by 46% (table 1). the eﬀect of the selective

analysis of results
the percent inhibition of cytokine release was compared to positive control and average inhibition for
each concentration was calculated. the ic50 values
were determined using an in-house programmed pc
software package (edx 2.1).

inhibitors of pde1 – vinpocetine (20 mol: 6 % inhibition), of pde2 –  xxxd1974xxx  (20 mol: 21 % inhibition)
and of pde5 – zaprinast and e 4021 (30 mol: 36%
and 28% inhibition, respectively) were weak.  xxxd2341xxx  and milrinone, selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors, suppressed tnf secretion to a certain extent (30 mol:
22% inhibition and ic50: 20.5 mol/l, respectively).
nevertheless, the most potent eﬀects on tnf release
from human blood cells were observed in presence of
selective pde4 inhibitors (fig. 1).  xxxd1697xxx , d22888,  xxxd3142xxx , awd 12-281 and  xxxd2945xxx  reduced the tnf generation potently in a concentration
dependent manner with ic50 values of 2.5, 1.8, 1.2,
0.8 and 0.076 mol/l, respectively.
the tested glucocorticoids inhibited the cytokine
release potently in a concentration dependent
manner. beclomethasone (ic50 : 0.117 mol/l) was
quite equi-eﬀective compared to dexamethasone (ic50 :
0.079 mol/l). fluticasone (ic50 : 0.0027 mol/l) was
the most potent inhibitor in this model (fig. 2).
in the supernatant of unstimulated nasal polyp cells
average levels of tnf in the range from 80–175
pg/ml and gm-csf from 50–75 pg/ml were detected
and increased within 18 h after stimulation to 400–440
pg/ml and 160–185 pg/ml, respectively. the results
obtained from human blood cells are directly comparable to those found in the cell culture model of

nasal polyp cells. the inhibitory eﬀect of the nonspecific pde inhibitor theophylline on the release
of tnf (100 mol/l: 26% inhibition) and gm-csf
(100 mol/l: 12% inhibition) was just as low as in
human blood. moreover, the inhibitors of pde1 vinpocetine, pde2  xxxd1974xxx , and pde5 either zaprinast
or e4021 were almost without any eﬀect on both
tnf and gm-csf release. in contrast, the pde 3
inhibitors milrinone and  xxxd2341xxx  reduced the release
of tnf in a concentration dependent manner with

ic50 values of 25 and 67 mol/l, respectively (fig. 3).
additionally,  xxxd2341xxx  inhibited gm-csf release
quite equi-eﬀective with an ic50 value of 49 mol/l.
milrinone was much weaker and reduced gm-csf
release only by 21% at a concentration of 100 mol/l
(fig. 4). just as in the human whole blood assay, the
strongest eﬀects on the release of both cytokines were
observed when the pde4 isoenzyme was selectively
inhibited. d-22888,  xxxd3142xxx ,  xxxd1697xxx  and awd
12-281 reduced tnf with ic50 values of 0.46, 0.1, 0.1
and 0.09 mol/l, respectively. gm-csf release was
reduced by these pde4 inhibitors with ic50 values of
2.15, 0.7, 0.5 and 0.54 mol/l, respectively. rpr
73401 proved to be most eﬀective with an ic50 of
0.014 mol/l for tnf inhibition and 0.022 mol/l for
gm-csf inhibition (fig. 5 and 6).

the eﬀect of the tested glucocorticoids on tnf
release from dispersed nasal polyp cells was, with the
exception of dexamethasone, relatively weak. the
inhibition at the highest tested concentration of
1 mol/l beclomethasone and fluticasone was 43% and
48%, respectively (fig. 7). dexamethasone inhibited
the tnf release with an ic50 value of 89 nmol/l. the
eﬀect of the glucocorticoids on gm-csf release was
much more potent and in all cases concentration
dependent. the ic50 values for dexamethasone, beclomethasone and fluticasone were 5 nmol/l, 25 nmol/l
and 0.4 nmol/l, respectively (fig. 8).

discussion

of diﬀerent pde isoenzyme inhibitors as well as glucocorticoids on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines using allergically challenged human nasal polyp

cells and human whole blood stimulated with lps.
interpreting the results, diﬀerences in the test systems
should be considered. the two in vitro models represent diﬀerent activation pathways and cell populations. in the human whole blood assay a direct
activation of leukocytes is achieved by the use of lps.
in the nasal polyp cell population the stimulation via
ige/anti-ige acts primary on mast cells, although they
can produce this cytokines these cells are most likely
not the only source for tnf or gm-csf. therefore
the activation of mast cells seems to be the trigger for
a cell activation cascade in this system and epithelial
cells, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils contribute to the cytokine production.
the inhibition of tnf production by pde inhibitors is a transcriptional eﬀect mediated through
the elevation of the intracellular levels of camp.
elevation of camp leads to inhibition of diverse
leukocyte functions and cytokine synthesis.37 pde4

isoenzyme appears to be a major pde isoform responsible for catabolism of camp and regulation
of inflammatory function in many cells including
monocytes, lymphocytes, mast cells, basophils and
neutrophils.38–40 in vivo, lps induced release of tnf
augments inflammatory cellular influx into the bronchial mucosa by up-regulating the expression of adhesion molecules on the microvasculature and the
subsequent recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells.9
our present results confirm that both type 3 and 4
pde inhibitors were eﬀective in inhibiting cytokine
release from diluted human blood and from nasal
polyp cells. the pde4 inhibitors  xxxd3142xxx , rpr
73401,  xxxd1697xxx , d-22888 and awd 12-281 suppressed tnf release from whole blood as well as tnf
and gm-csf from nasal polyp cells very eﬀectively.
moreover, suppression of tnf production in blood
and nasal polyp cells correlates well with the potency
of inhibition of pde4 catalytic activity and not with
inhibition of  xxxd3142xxx  binding aﬃnity which is consistent with other published data.41,42 the inhibitory
eﬀect on the gm-csf release was concentration dependent and strong but less pronounced than the
eﬀect on tnf. in all investigations pde4 inhibitors
reduced tnf release to a much higher degree (4–10
fold) than gm-csf release.
 xxxd2341xxx  and milrinone, the selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors, suppressed tnf and gm-csf release to a
lesser extent. human peripheral blood monocytes
contain almost exclusively the type pde4 with a minor
 xxxg1695xxx  activity which accounts for about 15–25% of
the total camp hydrolysis.43–45 mast cells, t lymphocytes, epithelial and endothelial cells, which are
present in the polyp cell culture, involve some  xxxg1695xxx 
activity.26,46 therefore, a certain antiinflammatory potency of selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors can be expected in
this models.
the selective inhibitors vinpocetine (pde1),  xxxd1974xxx 
(pde2), e-4021 and zaprinast (both pde5) were
without any relevant eﬀect on cytokine release. these
findings correlate well with investigations by molnarkimber47 and banner.48
in these series of experiments, there was no significant antiinflammatory eﬀect of the unspecific pde
inhibitor theophylline. only at higher concentrations,
an unspecific inhibition of cytokine release was found,
but such high plasma levels would never be tolerated
by patients (plasma level between 30–80 mol/l in
patients).
glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of inflammatory proteins (cytokines such as tnf and  xxxg1169xxx , inflammatory enzymes, inflammatory receptors)
involved in asthmatic inflammation.49 glucocorticoids exert their antiinflammatory eﬀects by
binding to a cytoplasmic  xxxg1601xxx 
within target cells, thus acting as transcription factor

modulation of tnf and gm-csf release

and thereby regulating gene expression.50 the lpsinduced release of tnf from diluted blood was
suppressed by all corticosteroids investigated in this
study. the degree of inhibition correlated well
with the aﬃnity to the  xxxg1601xxx  and
fluticasone showed the strongest inhibition due to
its highest aﬃnity to the receptor.51–53 surprisingly,
in nasal polyp cells dexamethasone was the only
glucocorticoid which potently suppressed the allergically induced tnf release. these results cannot
be explained at present and needs further investigations. interestingly, a similar phenomenon
was observed by hamilos et al54 who reported that
intranasal treatment of nasal polyps with fluticasone
resulted in a reduction of inflammation but the
expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as
tnf remained relatively unaﬀected by steroid treatment. on the other hand, the gm-csf-release
from dispersed nasal polyp cells was concentrationdependently inhibited by corticosteroids. corresponding to the receptor aﬃnity, fluticasone
showed the highest inhibition degree. recently,
rudack et al.55 have demonstrated that prednisolone
inhibits the gm-csf-synthesis in vitro in the nasal
polyp tissue.
both in vitro models, lps induced tnf release
from human blood as well as allergically induced
tnf and gm-csf release from dispersed nasal
polyp cells are well suited to investigate the antiinflammatory properties of new compounds. pde4
inhibitors and glucocorticoids inhibited tnf and
gm-csf release in human blood and in nasal
polyp cells in a concentration-dependent manner.
pde4, the phosphodiesterase isoenzyme which is
expressed in most inflammatory cells, is chiefly
involved in the events going on in stimulated
response of human leukocytes and nasal polyp cells.
the tested selective pde4 inhibitors reduced tnf
and gm-csf release and a good correlation to
inhibition of the catalytic activity was found. beside
pde4 inhibitors,  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors were eﬀective in
these models to a certain extent, whereas inhibitors
of other pde isoenzymes seems to play a minor
role. theophylline, an unspecific pde inhibitor was
ineﬀective. the glucocorticoids were the most potent
inhibitors of gm-csf release from dispersed nasal
polyp cells and this property correlates well with
the aﬃnity to the  xxxg1601xxx . although
the lps induced tnf release in whole blood was
concentration dependently inhibited by all tested
steroids, the allergically induced tnf release from
nasal polyp cells was only inhibited by dexamethasone (at a 19 fold higher concentration
than for gm-csf release). the reason for this
observation is still unknown and remains to be
elucidated.
