catalyze the first committed step in prostaglandin (pg)2 biosynthesis (reviewed in refs. 1, 2). the product, pgh2, is produced as a result of two sequential reactions that are performed
in separate but functionally linked active sites. in the first reaction,  xxxd208xxx  (aa; 20:4 ␻-6) bound in the cyclooxygenase channel undergoes a bis-oxygenation to form the intermediate pgg2. the released intermediate is then bound in the
peroxidase active site, where the 15-hydroperoxide group of
pgg2 is reduced to form pgh2 in the second reaction. both
 xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 require a preliminary catalytic turnover at
the peroxidase active site to generate an oxy-ferryl porphyrin
radical that is subsequently transferred to tyr-385 for the initiation of cyclooxygenase catalysis.
understanding the similarities and differences associated
with the structure and function of  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 and the
rationale for the existence of two isoforms has been the focus of
much recent research (3–5).  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2, which are
encoded by separate genes (6), display ⬃60% sequence identity
within the same species and greater than 85% sequence identity
among orthologs from different species (7). accordingly, the
crystal structures of  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 are virtually superimposable, and the catalytic mechanism is conserved between isoforms (1, 7). the major difference between  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2
is in their observed expression patterns (8). in most cases,
 xxxg1883xxx  is expressed constitutively, producing pgs that mediate
“housekeeping” functions, whereas cox-2 is expressed in
response to growth factors, tumor promoters, or cytokines (8).
pgs produced via cox-2 are intimately involved in a number
of pathologies, including inflammation, pain, and colon cancer
(9). other differences between isoforms include the following:
(a) the lower concentration of reducing cosubstrate required by
cox-2 for activation compared with  xxxg1883xxx , allowing for the
utilization of aa when it is a small constituent in a fatty acid
pool in vivo (4, 5, 10); and (b) the ability of aspirin-acetylated
cox-2 to oxygenate aa, which shifts the reaction specificity
such that (15r)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ((15r)-hete) is
formed instead of pgh2 (11, 12).
although aa is the preferred substrate for  xxxg1883xxx  and
cox-2, other  xxxd2154xxx  can be oxygenated by both isoforms
with varying efficiencies (13–15). a prime example is the 30%
efficiency (compared with aa) by which cox-2 can oxygenate
the fatty acid  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) (20:5 ␻-3) as

the cyclooxygenases ( xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2) are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that generate prostaglandin h2 from  xxxd208xxx  (aa). although aa is the preferred substrate, other  xxxd2154xxx  are oxygenated by these
enzymes with varying efficiencies. we determined the crystal
structures of aa,  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) bound to co3ⴙ- xxxd3037xxx -reconstituted murine cox-2 to 2.1, 2.4, and 2.65 å, respectively.
aa, epa, and docosahexaenoic acid bind in different conformations in each monomer constituting the homodimer in their
respective structures such that one monomer exhibits nonproductive binding and the other productive binding of the substrate in the cyclooxygenase channel. the interactions identified between protein and substrate when bound to  xxxg1883xxx  are
conserved in our cox-2 structures, with the only notable difference being the lack of interaction of the carboxylate of aa and
epa with the side chain of arg-120. leu-531 exhibits a different
side chain conformation when the nonproductive and productive binding modes of aa are compared. unlike  xxxg1883xxx , mutating this residue to ala, phe, pro, or thr did not result in a significant loss of activity or substrate binding affinity.
determination of the l531f:aa crystal structure resulted in aa
binding in the same global conformation in each monomer. we
speculate that the mobility of the leu-531 side chain increases
the volume available at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel and contributes to the observed ability of cox-2 to oxygenate a broad spectrum of fatty acid and fatty ester substrates.

 xxxg1282xxx  for crystallization trials. the apoenzyme was reconstituted with co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx  and fatty acid substrate to
generate the appropriate enzyme-substrate complexes for x-ray
crystallographic analyses. crystal structures of mucox-2 in
complex with aa, epa, and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) (22:6
␻-3) were elucidated to resolutions of 2.1, 2.4, and 2.65 å,
respectively. the structures were utilized to detail and functionally characterize the nuances involved in the binding of
fatty acid substrates in the cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2.

opposed to the less than 5% efficiency by which  xxxg1883xxx  oxygenates this substrate (14, 16). cox-2 can also oxygenate a more
extensive array of substrates compared with  xxxg1883xxx , presumably because of an ⬃20% larger active site created by a highly
conserved i523v substitution between isoforms (17). marnett
and co-workers (18 –20) have established that cox-2, but not
 xxxg1883xxx , oxygenates the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonylglycerol, arachidonylethanolamide, and n-arachidonylglycine, utilizing the same general catalytic mechanism derived for aa.
these substrates are larger than aa due to the additional
chemical constituent attached to the ␦-end of the fatty acid.
crystal structures of ovine (ov)  xxxg1883xxx  have been elucidated
in the presence of aa and other fatty acid substrates to moderate resolutions (⬃3.0 å) (16, 21–23). the  xxxd2154xxx  in these
structures are all oriented in the cyclooxygenase channel such
that the carboxylate of the substrate interacts with the guanidinium group of arg-120 and the ␻-end of the substrate binds
in a hydrophobic groove above ser-530, resulting in the placement of c-13 below tyr-385 (7). the ovcox-1:fatty acid crystal structures provided experimental verification at the molecular level of fundamental components of the cyclooxygenase
reaction previously identified via biochemical studies, including the following: the required interaction between arg-120
and the carboxylate of the fatty acid substrate (22, 24); the positioning of the 13-pro-s hydrogen below tyr-385 for subsequent
abstraction (2, 22); and the placement of the ␻-end of the fatty
acid substrate within the hydrophobic groove, where the terminal carbon lies adjacent to gly-533 (22, 25). furthermore, analysis of the spatial arrangement of aa within the cyclooxygenase
channel of the ovcox-1:aa crystal structure allowed for the
proposal of a valid sequence of events for the generation of
pgg2 and recycling of the tyrosyl radical during cyclooxygenase catalysis (22). aa bound in its productive conformation in
ovcox-1 has been utilized as a model to wed structure with
functional studies carried out on both  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 that
have investigated the catalytic process and molecular determinants governing substrate binding, specificity, and product formation (16, 19 –21, 23, 26 –30).
attempts to study the structure of aa bound in the cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2 have yielded interesting but somewhat ambiguous results. kiefer et al. (31) reported the structure
of aa bound to the apoenzyme form of murine (mu) cox-2 in
an attempt to prevent oxygenation of the substrate during crystallization. the electron density observed in the cyclooxygenase channel of the resulting structure suggested a mixture of aa
and pgg2. the authors concluded that contamination of the
protein preparation with heme-containing cox-2 led to the
oxygenation of aa during the crystallization process. in
another attempt, a peroxidase-inactive mutant (h207a) of
mucox-2 was used to form a complex with aa. analysis of the
electron density within the cyclooxygenase channel of this
structure showed that aa had indeed bound, but in a nonproductive conformation in which the carboxylate of aa hydrogen-bonded to tyr-385 and ser-530 at the apex of the channel
instead of near the opening. we report here studies designed to
further investigate the structural basis of fatty acid substrate
binding to cox-2. we engineered a his6-tagged n580a
mucox-2 construct to produce milligram quantities of apoen-

trode. each standard assay mixture contained 3 ml of 100 mm
tris, ph 8.0, 1 mm phenol, 5 ␮m hematin, and 1–200 ␮m substrate. reactions were initiated by the addition of up to 20 ␮g of
protein in a volume of 20 ␮l. km and vmax values were determined by measuring oxygen uptake using 1–200 ␮m fatty acid
substrate and fitting the data to the michaelis-menten equation
using graphpad prism 5.0 for windows (graphpad software,
san diego). peroxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 25 °c. the reaction mixture in the cuvette contained 100 mm tris, ph 8.0, 100 ␮m n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetramethylphenylenediamine, 1.7 ␮m hematin, and up to 100 ␮g of protein.
reactions were initiated by adding 100 ␮l of 300 ␮m h2o2, and
the oxidation of n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetramethylphenylenediamine was
monitored at 610 nm over time.
crystallization and data collection—for crystallization,
purified apo-his6 n580a mucox-2 (or the l531f mutant) was
reconstituted with a 2-fold molar excess of co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx , followed by dialysis overnight at 4 °c against 20 mm tris,
ph 8.0, 100 mm nacl, 0.6% (w/v) ␤og. just prior to setup, a
10-fold molar excess of substrate was added to the reconstituted protein. initial crystallization screening was carried out
on the mucox-2:aa complex using the 1536 microbatch-under-oil screen offered by the high throughput crystallization
laboratory, at the hauptman-woodward medical research
institute (34). one subsequent crystallization lead was further
optimized to generate crystals of the cox-2:fatty acid complexes utilized in this study. specifically, crystals were grown in
sitting-drops by combining 3 ␮l of protein solution with 3 ␮l of
23–34% polyacrylic acid 5100, 100 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 20 mm
mgcl2, and 0.6% (w/v) ␤og and equilibrating over reservoir
solutions containing 23–34% polyacrylic acid 5100, 100 mm
hepes, ph 7.5, and 20 mm mgcl2. trays were incubated at
23 °c, and plate-like crystals were formed in 3 days up until
approximately 4 weeks. crystals were cryopreserved via transfer to a solution consisting of 30% polyacrylic acid 5100, 100 mm
hepes, ph 7.5, 20 mm mgcl2, 0.6% (w/v) ␤og, and 10% ethylene glycol. following incubation in cryoprotectant for
10 –120 min, the crystals were looped and flash-cooled directly
into the nitrogen gas stream prior to diffraction analysis. data
were collected on beamline a1 at the cornell high energy synchrotron source (ithaca, ny) at a wavelength of 0.9789 å using
an area detector systems ccd quantum-210 detector. datasets were integrated and scaled using mosflm and scala,
respectively, in the ccp4 suite of programs (35). for the l531f
mutant cox-2:aa structure, the dataset was assembled from
diffraction measurements from two crystals. the data from
each crystal was processed individually using mosflm and
then scaled together using sortmtz and scala. details of
the data collection statistics are summarized in table 1.
structure solution and refinement—although crystal structures of both  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 have been elucidated, extensive care was taken to remove model bias during the structure
solution and refinement process given the crystallographic
observations reported previously for aa in complex with apoand h207a mucox-2 (31). as such, difference fourier maps
were not utilized to generate initial phases for the enzyme-substrate complexes. instead, a modified version of monomer a of
protein data bank entry 1cvu (31) was created in which all

generation of recombinant baculovirus and expression of
murine cox-2—positive baculovirus was generated for his6
n580a mucox-2 and mutant constructs via the transformation of max efficiency dh10bac cells with the appropriate construct in pfastbac1, followed by transfection of sf21 insect cells
with the isolated bacmid dna. the initial p1 virus stock was
amplified in 50 ml of sf21 insect cells using a multiplicity of
infection (moi) of 0.1 plaque-forming unit/ml. the resulting
p2 virus was harvested 48 h post-infection, plaque-assayed, and
used to generate large quantities of p3 virus for subsequent
large scale expressions. for expression, sf21 insect cells were
grown at 27 °c in sf-900 ii serum-free media supplemented
with 1.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and the appropriate antibiotics and additives and maintained in suspension in an 8-liter
spinner flask equipped with an air-sparging line for proper aeration. the cells were infected with p3 virus stock at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 once the cell density reached ⬃2.0 ⫻ 106
cells/ml in the spinner flask and harvested via centrifugation
72–96 h post-infection in conjunction with a drop in cell viability to below 80%. cell pellet was harvested via centrifugation,
pooled, and stored at ⫺80 °c.
purification of murine cox-2—the cell pellet from 2 liters of
culture was resuspended in 50 mm tris, ph 8.0, 300 mm nacl,
10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm  xxxd26xxx  (2 ml/g cell
pellet) and subsequently ruptured using a microfluidizer
(microfluidics, newton, ma). decyl maltoside was added to the
cell lysate to a final concentration of 0.7% (w/v), and the protein
was solubilized for 1 h with stirring at 4 °c. the mixture was
then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm at 4 °c for 1 h to remove insoluble debris. the clarified supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml
hitrap chelating hp column and washed with buffer a (50 mm
tris, ph 8.0, 300 mm nacl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , and 0.5% (w/v) decyl maltoside). an intermediate
wash step consisting of 10 column volumes was carried out
using buffer b (buffer a containing a final concentration of 60
mm imidazole), followed by elution with buffer c (buffer a containing 200 mm imidazole) over 5 column volumes. functionally active fractions were subsequently pooled and dialyzed
overnight at 4 °c against 50 mm tris, ph 8.0, 300 mm nacl, and
0.53% (w/v) ␤og to initiate detergent exchange for crystallization. the sample was concentrated to ⬃2 ml using a millipore
ultrafree-15 spin concentrator with a 50-kda nominal molecular mass cutoff. the concentrated protein sample was then
trypsin-digested for 20 –90 min at 25 °c with a 30:1 ratio  xxxg1884xxx :trypsin (33). the reaction was terminated via the addition of 2
mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. trypsin digestion has no
deleterious affect on cox-2 function, as digested protein contained cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activity comparable with
the undigested sample. the protein was then subjected to sizeexclusion chromatography utilizing a hiprep 16/60 sephacryl
s-300 hr column equilibrated in 25 mm tris, ph 8.0, 150 mm
nacl, and 0.53% (w/v) ␤og. the peak fractions of the purified
his6 n580a mucox-2 constructs were pooled and concentrated to 3 mg/ml for crystallization trials.
cyclooxygenase and peroxidase assays—for measurement of
cyclooxygenase activity, the initial rate of o2 uptake was measured at 37 °c using a model 5300 biological oxygen monitor
(ysi inc., yellow springs, oh), equipped with an oxygen elec-

ligands and waters as well as residues 33–144, 320 –325, 344 –
391, and 500 –553 were deleted. the regions deleted encompass the n and c termini, as well as the membrane binding
domain and walls of the cyclooxygenase channel. the remaining structure (⬃60% of the total residues) was then utilized as
the search model for molecular replacement calculations on
each dataset using the program phaser (36). the subsequent
phases were then used as input to arp/warp (37) utilizing the
“automated model building starting from experimental phases”
option, which further minimizes the introduction of model bias
(38). arp/warp was able to build the majority of missing portions of the protein model. iterative cycles of manual model
building and refinement, using the programs coot (39) and
refmac5 (40), were then carried out to fit the remaining residues and to add waters, substrate, sugar moieties, and other
ligand molecules. the coordinates and stereochemical dictionaries for aa, epa, and dha were downloaded from the prodrg server (41). tls refinement (42), utilizing the tlsmd
web server (43, 44), was carried out on each structure during the
final rounds of refmac5 refinement. final refinement statistics are summarized in table 1.
to verify that the observed differences between the conformations of aa and epa in each monomer were significant, we
performed the following exercise in both the mucox-2:aa
and mucox-2:epa crystal structures. the substrate model
built in the nonproductive conformation in monomer a was
replaced with the substrate model built in the productive conformation from monomer b and vice versa. cycles of refjuly 16, 2010 • volume 285 • number 29

mac5 refinement were carried out, followed by the calculation
of 2fo ⫺ fc and fo ⫺ fc electron density maps. in the areas
where the carbon positions differ between the substrates, we
would expect to see the appropriate “positive” and “negative”
electron density peaks in the calculated fo ⫺ fc electron density
maps. a similar method has been used to verify the changes
observed between fatty acid substrates bound in the cyclooxygenase channel of ovcox-1 (16, 23). inspection of the resulting
electron density maps clearly shows positive difference density
in the hydrophobic groove above ser-530 in monomer b, when
aa and epa are modeled in their nonproductive conformations. similarly, negative difference density is observed for the

to characterize the binding of fatty acid substrates within the
cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2, we generated a construct of
mucox-2 that was optimized for structural biology studies. a
his6 tag was engineered into mucox-2 two residues beyond
the signal sequence at the n terminus of the enzyme to facilitate
purification of the enzyme (32). in addition, we mutated asn580, one of four known n-glycosylation sites in cox-2 (48) to
alanine. roughly 50% of the cox-2 molecules are n-glycosylated at asn-580 (48). subsequent replacement of this residue
with alanine results in the removal of n-glycosylation heterogeneity. the resulting his6 n580a mucox-2 construct was
utilized in an insect cell-based expression system to overproduce recombinant enzyme, and a two-step purification protocol, consisting of immobilized metal affinity and size-exclusion
chromatography steps, was implemented to generate milligram
quantities of the protein. the purified his6 n580a mucox-2
enzyme was functionally characterized by spectrophotometric
measurement of the peroxidase activity and determination of
the oxygen consumption kinetics using an oxygen electrode,
with aa, epa, and dha utilized as fatty acid substrates. the
enzyme retains complete peroxidase activity with respect to
untagged, natively glycosylated wild-type mucox-2 (data not
shown). moreover, calculated kcat and km values are nearly
identical to those reported previously for hucox-2 and
mucox-2 when aa and epa are utilized as substrates (table
2) (14, 15). dha is a poor substrate for hucox-2, exhibiting a
specific activity of ⬃10% relative to the oxygenation of aa (15).
when his6 n580a mucox-2 was tested with dha, we
observed a similar relative activity to that reported for
hucox-2, with a km value ⬃7-fold higher than that of aa (table
2). taken together, the his6 and n580a modifications that were
introduced into the native mucox-2 construct to facilitate the
steps associated with generating the required quantities of protein
for x-ray crystallographic studies do not influence or alter the ability of the enzyme to oxygenate fatty acid substrates.

mucox-2 in complex with aa, epa, dha, as well as for the
l531f mucox-2:aa complex have been deposited in the protein

crystallographic structure determination of native and
mutant cox-2:fatty acid complexes—to generate stable
complexes of the fatty acid substrates within the cyclooxygenase channel, we reconstituted purified apo-his6 n580a
mucox-2 with co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx  to create a native-like
enzyme that lacks both peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activity
and hence does not form pg product when incubated with
substrates (49). this method has been used successfully to trap
aa and other fatty acid substrates within the cyclooxygenase
channel of ovcox-1 for structural studies (16, 21–23). we subsequently determined the crystal structures of his6 n580a
mucox-2 in complex with the fatty acid substrates aa, epa,
and dha using synchrotron radiation. (accordingly, we use
the naming conventions of mucox-2:aa, mucox-2:epa,
and mucox-2:dha, when describing the co-crystal
structures.)
each of the mucox-2:fatty acid structures contains two
monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (termed
“monomer a” and “monomer b” for comparison purposes) that
form the canonical biological dimer. interpretable electron
density was observed for co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx  and the carbohydrate moieties linked to asn-68, asn-144, and asn-410 in
each monomer (residue numbering based on ovcox-1 numbering scheme), and a single ␤og molecule was observed at a
crystallographic special position for each dimer (data not
shown). no electron density was observed for c-terminal residues beyond gln-584 in monomer a and val-583 in monomer
b in any of the mucox-2:fatty acid complexes. the domain
architecture, which includes the n-terminal epidermal growth
factor domain, the membrane-binding domain, and the catalytic domain, is well resolved for each monomer in all three
structures. there are no significant structural differences
between monomers within each mucox-2:fatty acid structure
(a versus b) or between monomers of the different mucox-2:
fatty acid structures (a versus a, b versus b, and a versus b)
when compared, as calculated root mean square deviations
(r.m.s.d.) between monomers are within the mean positional
error of these structures (supplemental table s1).
interpretable electron density was observed for fatty acid
substrate in the cyclooxygenase channel of each monomer of
the mucox-2 dimer for the structures determined. however,
there are significant conformational differences observed for
aa within the cyclooxygenase channels in the mucox-2:aa
crystal structure and epa in the mucox-2:epa crystal structure when their corresponding monomers (monomer a and
monomer b) are examined. specifically, aa is bound in monomer a such that the carboxylate of the fatty acid substrate interacts with tyr-385 and ser-530 at the apex of the channel, similar to that observed by kiefer et al. (31) and generally referred
to as a nonproductive binding mode for aa (fig. 1a). in stark
contrast, aa is bound in monomer b such that the carboxylate
lies near arg-120 and tyr-355 at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel, similar to the productive binding mode of aa
observed in the ovcox-1:aa crystal structure (fig. 1b) (22).
similarly, epa binds in a nonproductive conformation in monomer a (supplemental fig. s1) and a productive conformation
in monomer b (fig. 2a) in the mucox-2:epa crystal structure.
interestingly, dha adopts similar global substrate conforma-

within these structures is described in detail below.
aa and epa bound in a productive conformation within the
cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2—the conformations of aa
and epa observed in monomer b of the mucox-2:aa and
mucox2:epa crystal structures exhibit the “l-shaped” configuration observed for aa and other fatty acid substrates bound
in the cyclooxygenase channel of ovcox-1 (fig. 3, a and c) (16,
22, 23). in both cases, the carboxylate of the substrate is positioned at the channel opening near the side chains of arg-120
and tyr-355, and the ␻-end is encased by residues phe-205,
phe-209, val-228, val-344, phe-381, and leu-534, which form a
hydrophobic groove above ser-530. the central substrate carbons of aa and epa weave around the side chain of ser-530,
properly placing c-13 of each substrate 2.95 and 2.96 å, respectively, below the phenolic oxygen of tyr-385 for abstraction of
the 13-pro-s hydrogen. as such, the observed conformations of
aa and epa in monomer b of these structures can be considered as productive substrate conformations given that they
exhibit the proper positioning and stereochemical alignment
necessary for initiation of the cyclooxygenase reaction (22).

aa and epa make a total of 54 and 56 contacts, respectively,
with 19 residues that line the cyclooxygenase active site in
the mucox-2:aa and mucox-2:epa crystal structures
(supplemental table s2 and s3). the 19 residues participating
in these interactions are essentially conserved with respect to
those observed to form contacts with fatty acid substrates
bound in the cyclooxygenase channel of ovcox-1 (16, 22, 23).
the major difference between the active site residue contacts
made by aa and epa in the mucox-2:aa and mucox-2:epa
crystal structures compared with those made between substrate and active site residues in ovcox-1 is the lack of an
interaction between the carboxylate of these two substrates and
the side chain of arg-120. this interaction is a required molecular determinant for the binding of fatty acid substrates to
 xxxg1883xxx  (24), but not cox-2, and our structural data confirm
previous mutagenesis studies to this effect (50). indeed, only
one hydrophilic contact is made by aa and epa with cyclooxygenase active site residues in these structures, a hydrogen bond
between the carboxylate oxygen o1 of each substrate and the
phenolic hydroxyl of tyr-355, compared with three in structures of  xxxd2154xxx  bound to ovcox-1 (16, 22, 23). the lack of a
required interaction between the carboxylate of aa and epa
and side chain of arg-120 coupled with the larger volume of the
cox-2 cyclooxygenase channel also provides these substrates
with greater conformational freedom within the active site of
cox-2. this is borne out in r.m.s.d. values of 1.04 and 0.92 å
calculated for the productive conformations of aa and epa in
the mucox-2:aa and mucox-2:epa structures, respectively,
compared with the conformation exhibited by aa in the
ovcox-1:aa structure (supplemental table s4 and table s5).
 xxxg1883xxx  is essentially inactivated when epa is utilized as a
substrate due to epa binding in a strained conformation within
the cyclooxygenase channel, which results in the misalignment
of c-13 below tyr-385 (14, 16). the conformation of epa
within the cyclooxygenase channel of monomer b of the
mucox-2:epa crystal structure is significantly different from
that observed in the ovcox-1:epa crystal structure, with a
calculated r.m.s.d. of 2.28 å between the 22 atoms of the substrate (supplemental table s6). the observed conformation of
epa in monomer b is more closely related to that observed for
aa in both the ovcox-1:aa and mucox-2:aa (monomer b)
crystal structures (fig. 3, b and c). in this orientation, c-13 of
epa is properly aligned below tyr-385, consistent with kinetic
data showing that cox-2 can utilize epa as a substrate (table
2) (14). the decreased efficiency observed for the oxygenation
of epa by cox-2 compared with aa may be explained by the
presence of an additional double bond at the ␻-end of the substrate. the increased rigidity likely constrains the conformational flexibility at the ␻-end, which in turn limits its maneuverability within the cyclooxygenase channel during catalysis.
indeed, there is an ⬃2-fold increase in the km value for aa and
epa binding to mucox-2 (table 2).
the spatial positions of the side chains of the cyclooxygenase
active site residues in monomer b of the mucox-2:aa and
mucox-2:epa crystal structures remain mostly unchanged
compared with their positions in the ovcox-1:aa and
ovcox-1:epa crystal structures. the only notable exceptions
are differences exhibited by the side chains of arg-120, ser-530,

21-fold reduction and 27-fold increase in relative specific activity and km values, respectively, compared with wild-type
ovcox-1 (26). substitutions of leu-531 with asn, asp, ile, and
val in ovcox-1 also result in 5–14-fold reductions in relative
specific activity (26, 52). however, as is the case for the cox-2
substitutions, km values for these ovcox-1 substitutions
remain unchanged or are slightly lower compared with wildtype enzyme (26, 52). hence, leu-531 substitutions are more
tolerated in mucox-2, whereas a reduction in size or conservative replacement of this side chain in ovcox-1 significantly
affects the proper alignment of substrate for oxygenation (26).
to investigate the structural consequences of removing the
flexibility associated with the leu-531 side chain on aa binding
in the cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2, we determined the
crystal structure of co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx -reconstituted
l531f mucox-2 in complex with aa (denoted l531f:aa). as
with the other mucox-2:fatty acid complexes, the domain
architecture, co3⫹- xxxd3037xxx , and carbohydrate moieties are well resolved in the crystal structure, and there are no
significant structural differences between monomers (data not
shown). in contrast to what we observe in the mucox-2:aa
and mucox-2:epa crystal structures, the l531f mutation
causes aa to bind in the same global conformation in both
monomers of the l531f:aa crystal structure, with the carboxylate of aa located near the entrance of the cyclooxygenase
channel in each monomer (fig. 4, a and b). the ␻-end of the
substrate is bound in the hydrophobic groove above ser-530,
and the contacts made between aa and the residues lining the
cyclooxygenase channel are conserved with respect to those
identified when fatty acid substrates bind productively in the
cyclooxygenase channel (supplemental tables s10 and s11)
(16, 22, 23).
the side chain of leu-531 does not interact with fatty acid
substrate when it is bound in a productive conformation to
mucox-2 or when it is bound to ovcox-1 (16, 22, 23). instead,
it forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of arg120, suggesting a stabilizing role for this side chain in the maintenance of high affinity binding of substrate to ovcox-1 (26).
in the l531f:aa crystal structure, the side chain of phe-531 lies
above helix d of the membrane-binding domain in the vicinity
of arg-120, where it exhibits a single rotamer conformation
(fig. 4, a and b). substitution of leu for phe makes the side
chain long enough to make an additional hydrophobic contact
with c-1 of aa. this in turn influences the binding of the car-

fatty acid substrate binding in cox-2

discussion
in light of the difficulties and nuances associated with earlier
attempts to elucidate the structure of aa bound to mucox-2,
we applied techniques developed to produce ovcox-1:fatty
acid substrate complexes for crystallographic studies in an
attempt to determine the crystal structures of fatty acid substrates bound to mucox-2. all of the structures reported here
crystallized with i222 space group symmetry, with a biological
dimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. thus, there is no
crystallographic symmetry relating one monomer to the other
(as is the case with ovcox-1:fatty acid crystal structures), and
the biological dimer observed in these mucox-2:fatty acid
structures can be considered to contain two independent
monomers and hence two independent cyclooxygenase active
sites. as such, significant efforts were taken to eliminate the
introduction of model bias during the building and refinement
of fatty acid substrates within the cyclooxygenase channels so
that potential differences between substrate conformations or
active site residues in each monomer could be identified.
the conformation of aa, epa, and dha observed in monomer b of their respective crystal structures provides the first
insights at the molecular level for the productive binding of
these substrates in the cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2. the
observed productive conformations of aa and epa are in
accord with early models put forth for aa binding in the
cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2 that placed the carboxylate
near the opening of the channel near arg-120 and the ␻-end in
a hydrophobic groove above ser-530 (25, 50). the sequence of
events put forth for the cyclooxygenase reaction based on the

conformation of aa bound to ovcox-1 (22) is also valid for aa
and epa, given their similar overall l-shaped conformations
and the optimal positioning of c-13 beneath the phenolic oxygen of tyr-385 for hydrogen abstraction. moreover, the
observed constrained conformation of dha provides for an
explanation at the molecular level as to why monohydroxy acids
are formed upon oxygenation of this substrate by cox-2,
rather than a cyclic endoperoxide product.
when the binding of aa and epa in  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 are
compared, the first notable difference in cyclooxygenase active
site residues is related to the flexibility of ser-530, which exhibits alternate conformations for its side chain in the mucox2:aa crystal structure. the observed movement of the ser-530
side chain may provide for easier access of the ␻-end of the
substrate into the hydrophobic groove and also aid in the
proper positioning of c-13 for catalysis (7). furthermore, it is
possible that a reduction of the flexibility of the ser-530 side
chain plays a role in the generation of (15r)-hete upon aspirin
acetylation of cox-2.
the second notable difference is the lack of interaction
between the carboxylate of aa and epa and the side chain of
arg-120 in the mucox-2 crystal structures. an ionic interaction between the carboxylate and arg-120 is required for fatty
acid binding to  xxxg1883xxx  but not cox-2, and the mucox-2:aa
and mucox-2:epa crystal structures confirm previous
mutagenesis results to this effect. rieke et al. (50) postulated
that the lack of a required interaction between the carboxylate
of aa and the side chain of arg-120 in cox-2 suggested that
the hydrophobic residues lining the cyclooxygenase channel
contributed more significantly to fatty acid substrate binding to
cox-2. indeed, carbons c13–c20 of aa and epa make 40 and
38 of the 54 and 56 observed contacts (74 and 68%), respectively, with residues lining the hydrophobic groove above ser530 within the cyclooxygenase channel in monomer b of the
mucox-2:aa and mucox-2:epa crystal structures, compared with 26 of the 52 contacts (50%) made by the equivalent
carbons of aa in the ovcox-1:aa crystal structure. hence, the
lack of interaction between the carboxylate and arg-120 is now
compensated for by an increased number of hydrophobic contacts at the ␻-end of the substrate, ultimately providing aa and
epa with the ability to achieve greater conformational flexibility for the carboxylate end of the substrate in the cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2. this is supported by the greater than 0.9
å r.m.s.d. calculated for these substrates compared with the
position of aa bound in the cyclooxygenase channel of
ovcox-1 and in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations carried out to explore the equilibrium behavior of aa
bound to  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 (29).
the side chain of leu-531 must move to accommodate the
␻-end of the substrate when aa is bound nonproductively in
cox-2. movement of this side chain is the only notable difference when the positions of equivalent residues are compared
with the active sites of ovcox-1:aa and monomer b of
mucox-2:aa. in contrast to ovcox-1, leu-531 substitutions
in mucox-2 did not result in a significant loss of cyclooxygenase activity or binding affinity when aa was utilized as the
substrate. the side chain of leu-531 does not interact with fatty
acid substrates bound productively to ovcox-1 (16, 22, 23) or

volume of the cyclooxygenase channel available for aa binding
(fig. 4, c and d). this loss of volume combined with the rigidity
of the phe-531 side chain impedes aa from binding in a nonproductive conformation in monomer a. moreover, further
inspection of aa binding in each monomer of the l531f:aa
crystal structure indicates that aa does in fact bind differently
in each monomer despite their similar global orientations in the
cyclooxygenase channel. as observed for aa and epa in the
mucox-2:aa and mucox-2:epa crystal structures, aa is
bound productively in monomer b, with c-13 located ⬃3.2 å
below tyr-385 for hydrogen abstraction (fig. 4, a and d).
accordingly, the observed longer distance between c-13 and
the phenolic oxygen of tyr-385 compared with that observed in
the mucox-2:aa crystal structure likely explains the slight
decrease in relative specific activity for this mutant (table 3).
however, aa binds in a nonoptimal conformation in monomer
a, as c-13 is displaced with respect to its position in monomer
b such that the modeled 13-pro-s hydrogen points away from
tyr-385 in a manner similar to that observed for epa binding to
ovcox-1 (fig. 4, b and c) (16). hence, our functional analysis
of leu-531 mutants in cox-2 coupled with the l531f:aa crystal structure suggests that the side chain of leu-531 does not
play a significant role in high affinity binding of substrate to
cox-2 and only a minor role in aligning c-13 optimally below
tyr-385 for hydrogen abstraction. rather, the mobility
observed for the side chain of leu-531 results in an increase in
active site volume at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel
that influences the binding of certain fatty acid substrates.

fatty acid substrate binding in cox-2

higher affinity, which can then act to allosterically modulate
cyclooxygenase catalysis in the partner monomer, although the
residues and mechanism involved in mediating the cross-talk
between monomers have not been identified (15).
the crystal structures presented here agree with aspects of
the model proposed for half-of-sites activity for cyclooxygenase. specifically, we see fatty acid substrate bound in the
cyclooxygenase channel of both monomers of the canonical
cyclooxygenase homodimer. moreover, only one substrate is
bound in an optimal conformation for subsequent cyclooxygenase catalysis. in all of our cox-2:fatty acid crystal structures,
the substrate in monomer a is bound in either a nonproductive
conformation (mucox-2:aa and mucox-2:epa) or in a nonoptimal or perturbed conformation that results in the misalignment of c-13 (c-15 of dha) for catalysis (mucox-2:dha and
l531f:aa), whereas substrate is always bound productively in
monomer b. it remains unclear as to whether or not the nonproductive binding mode observed for aa and epa in monomer a of their respective crystal structures represents an “allosteric” conformation that contributes to the signaling at the
dimer interface (15). it is interesting to note that the global
conformational differences observed for aa and epa in monomer a of the mucox-2:aa and the mucox-2:epa crystal
structures versus the binding of dha and aa in monomer a of
the cox-2:dha and l531f:aa crystal structures correlate
with the ability of these substrates to attenuate cu2⫹/o-phenanthroline-induced cross-linking studies carried out using
p127c/s541c ⌬c hupghs-2 (15). based on these results, the
authors suggest that there are differences in the way that select
substrates interact within the cyclooxygenase channel of
cox-2 (15).
the different leu-531 side chain conformations are the most
significant changes observed when the areas in and around the
cyclooxygenase channel of monomer a and monomer b of
these crystal structures are compared. it is too early to speculate
as to whether or not the movement of this side chain is directly
or indirectly involved in mediating the cross-talk between
monomers. we also do not observe any significant changes in
residues at the dimer interface between monomers, which suggests that a large backbone movement is not the mechanism by
which the monomers relay the allosteric signal. it should be
noted, however, that large conformational backbone changes
are not the exclusive means by which proteins transmit allosteric signals. indeed, there are emerging ideas and new ways of
thinking about allostery and cross-talk that do not involve a
significant movement or change in shape (55, 56), and it is clear
that additional structural, functional, and biophysical analyses
will be required to shed light on the issue with respect to  xxxg1883xxx 
and cox-2.
in summary, the crystal structures of co3⫹-protoporphyrin
ix-reconstituted mucox-2 in complex with aa, epa, and
dha presented here provide the first molecular insight into the
productive binding of these substrates in the cyclooxygenase
channel of cox-2. moreover, our structure-function analyses
contribute to the verification of previous biochemical studies
undertaken to characterize the role that arg-120 and leu-531
play in fatty acid substrate binding to  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2.
finally, we show that the mobility of the side chain of leu-531

mucox-2. in both ovcox-1 and monomer b of the mucox2:aa structure, the side chain of leu-531 forms interactions
with the side chain of arg-120. this interaction has been postulated to provide stabilization of arg-120 for high affinity
binding of substrate to ovcox-1 (26). when aa is bound in a
nonproductive conformation, the ␻-end of the substrate interacts with the side chains of both arg-120 and leu-531, effectively replacing the direct interaction between the two side
chains, which occurs when substrate is bound productively. it is
unclear from a structural perspective whether or not the
observed flexibility of leu-531 in the mucox-2:aa crystal
structure is also a feature of the  xxxg1883xxx  homodimer, given that
the known crystal structures of ovcox-1 in complex with fatty
acid substrates all crystallized with a single monomer in the
asymmetric unit. however, the significant decrease in specific
activity observed for conservative substitutions of leu-531 in
ovcox-1 coupled with the strict requirement for the carboxylate of the fatty acid substrate to interact with the side chain of
arg-120 for high affinity binding suggests that leu-531 would
not exhibit the same side chain flexibility in the cyclooxygenase
channel of  xxxg1883xxx .
structural elucidation of the l531f:aa crystal structure
revealed aa bound in the same global conformation in each
monomer, with the side chain of phe-531 exhibiting a single
rotamer conformation. the l531f substitution introduces
rigidity at this site that decreases the volume of the cyclooxygenase channel available for substrate binding, which in turn
impedes the binding of aa in the nonproductive conformation.
the substitution also introduces a hydrophobic contact
between this side chain and carbon-1 of aa that influences the
carboxylate of aa to form the requisite ionic and hydrogen
bond interactions with the side chain of arg-120, analogous to
that observed for substrate binding to ovcox-1. thus, our
results indicate that the flexibility of the side chain of leu-531 is
important for increasing the volume available for substrate
binding at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel of
cox-2. as such, we postulate that the observed increase in
active site volume achieved by this movement is a significant
contributor to the observed ability of cox-2 to bind a broad
spectrum of fatty acid substrates and esters compared with
 xxxg1883xxx  (18, 20, 53).
why do we observe significantly different conformations of
aa and epa in each monomer of the biological dimer in the
mucox-2:aa and mucox-2:epa crystal structures? it has
recently been demonstrated that the cyclooxygenase enzymes
oxygenate fatty acid substrates via a half-of-sites reactivity
mechanism (54). accordingly, it has been postulated that at any
given time only one monomer of the cox-2 homodimer is
functional, and it alone accounts for the cyclooxygenase activity
of the enzyme. yuan et al. (54) initially speculated that only one
substrate molecule bound in the cyclooxygenase channel of one
monomer, which then could cause the partner monomer to
undergo a conformational change that inhibits substrate from
binding to this monomer. subsequent analyses from the same
laboratory have since demonstrated that substrate indeed binds
concurrently to each monomer of the dimer. as such, the current model of half-of-sites activity for cyclooxygenase involves
one monomer of the biological dimer binding substrate with a

fatty acid substrate binding in cox-2
influences the binding of aa and epa within the cyclooxygenase channel of cox-2 and suggest that this inherent flexibility
contributes to increase the volume available at the opening of
the cyclooxygenase channel so that cox-2 can oxygenate a
wide ranging array of fatty acid substrates and esters compared
with  xxxg1883xxx . the structural elucidation of cox-2 complexed
with these fatty acid-based cox-2-specific substrates will be
required to validate our hypothesis.
