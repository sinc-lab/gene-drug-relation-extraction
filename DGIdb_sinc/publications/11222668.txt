dopaminergic role in stimulant-induced wakefulness.  the role of dopamine in sleep regulation and in mediating the effects of wake-promoting therapeutics is controversial. in this study, polygraphic recordings and caudate microdialysate dopamine measurements in narcoleptic dogs revealed that the wake-promoting antinarcoleptic compounds modafinil and amphetamine increase extracellular dopamine in a  xxxg1032xxx -independent manner. in mice, deletion of the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) gene reduced non-rapid eye movement sleep time and increased wakefulness consolidation independently from locomotor effects. dat knock-out mice were also unresponsive to the normally robust wake-promoting action of modafinil, methamphetamine, and the selective dat blocker gbr12909 but were hypersensitive to the wake-promoting effects of caffeine. thus, dopamine transporters play an important role in sleep regulation and are necessary for the specific wake-promoting action of amphetamines and modafinil.
