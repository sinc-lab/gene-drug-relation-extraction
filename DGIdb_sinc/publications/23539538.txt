abstract

patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including mast cell leukemia, have a poor prognosis. in these
patients, neoplastic mast cells usually harbor the kit mutant d816v that confers resistance against  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors. we examined the effects of the multi-kinase blocker  xxxd2985xxx  on neoplastic mast cells and investigated
whether  xxxd2985xxx  acts synergistically with other antineoplastic drugs.  xxxd2985xxx  was found to inhibit the kinase
activity of kit g560v and kit d816v in the human mast cell leukemia cell line hmc-1. in addition,  xxxd2985xxx 
was found to block lyn- and  xxxg2216xxx  activity in neoplastic mast cells.  xxxd2985xxx  induced growth inhibition and
apoptosis in hmc-1.1 cells (kit g560v+) and hmc-1.2 cells (kit g560v+/kit d816v+) as well as in primary neoplastic mast cells. the effects of  xxxd2985xxx  were dose-dependent, but higher ic50-values were obtained in hmc-1
cells harboring kit d816v than in those lacking kit d816v. in drug combination experiments,  xxxd2985xxx  was
found to synergize with  xxxd2642xxx  in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis in hmc-1 cells and primary
neoplastic mast cells. the  xxxd2985xxx + xxxd2642xxx  combination induced substantial inhibition of kit-, lyn-, and
 xxxg2216xxx  activity, but did not suppress btk. we then applied a btk short interfering rna and found that btk knockdown sensitizes hmc-1 cells against  xxxd2985xxx . finally, we were able to show that  xxxd2985xxx  synergizes with the
btk-targeting drug  xxxd1815xxx  to produce growth inhibition in hmc-1 cells. in conclusion,  xxxd2985xxx  exerts major
growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic mast cells in advanced systemic mastocytosis and synergizes with
 xxxd2642xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  in inducing growth arrest in neoplastic mast cells.

introduction
systemic mastocytosis (sm) is a hematopoietic neoplasm
characterized by the expansion of neoplastic mast cells (mc)
and their infiltration in various internal organs.1-4 in patients
with advanced sm, including aggressive sm and mast cell
leukemia (mcl), mc infiltration leads to organ damage, and
the prognosis is grave.1-7 the response to conventional antineoplastic drugs and chemotherapy is poor.1-7 in most of these
patients, neoplastic mc express the d816v-mutated variant
of kit, which is constitutively active and is considered to be
a major transforming oncoprotein in neoplastic mc.8-11
unfortunately, in contrast to wild-type kit and some rare
kit mutants, the kit d816v mutant cannot be blocked by
pharmacologically meaningful concentrations of most available  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tki), including imatinib.11-14
during the past few years, several tki capable of targeting
the kinase activity of kit d816v have been developed. these
drugs include the multi-kinase blocker  xxxd2642xxx  ( xxxd2642xxx )
and  xxxd1815xxx .14-17 these agents are currently being tested in
clinical trials in advanced sm. however, neither  xxxd1815xxx  nor
 xxxd2642xxx  was found to induce long-lasting hematologic
remissions in patients with aggressive sm or mcl.18,19 in the

case of  xxxd1815xxx , the failure to achieve remissions may be
explained by the short half-life of the drug. in the case of
 xxxd2642xxx , multiple mechanisms as well as the pharmacological behavior of the drug and its metabolites may account
for the moderate efficacy. an important aspect of resistance
in advanced sm is that several kit d816v-independent signaling molecules and pathways are activated in neoplastic
mc, and contribute to abnormal growth and proliferation.18-20
sometimes, the more malignant subclone may lack kit
d816v, and tki-treated patients may even relapse with a kit
d816v-negative, drug-resistant leukemia.17 this observation
points to the need to target additional signaling nodes and
pathways in advanced sm.
a number of signaling molecules and pathways have been
implicated in drug resistance in advanced sm.20-22 critical signaling molecules may include ras, src-kinases such as lyn,
 xxxg1028xxx , or fyn, or the tek kinase btk, which is considered to
contribute to kit d816v-independent survival and proliferation of neoplastic mc.20-22 these additional signaling molecules are preferentially activated in advanced sm and cannot
be blocked by most tki, including  xxxd2642xxx . current
research is, therefore, focused on novel broadly acting tki
partners that can be combined with  xxxd2642xxx  to achieve

effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on neoplastic mast cells

better growth inhibition by blocking most signaling nodes
in the pro-oncogenic machinery of neoplastic mc.
the multi-kinase blocker  xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ) is an oral
tki that has been developed as a potent bcr- xxxg23xxx 
inhibitor.23  xxxd2985xxx  has inhibitory effects on a wide variety of kinase targets, including  xxxg801xxx , kit, fibroblast
growth factor receptor 1 ( xxxg791xxx ), and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor alpha (pdgfralpha).23-25 in addition,  xxxd2985xxx  has been described to block several downstream signaling molecules, including lyn.23-25
recently,  xxxd2985xxx  was tested in 65 patients with
philadelphia chromosome positive leukemia in a phase 1
clinical trial and was found to be highly active in heavily
pretreated patients.26 however, little is known about the
effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on growth of neoplastic mc. in the
present study, we examined the effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on
growth and survival of neoplastic mc and asked whether
the drug can produce synergistic growth-inhibtory effects
when combined with  xxxd2642xxx .

methods
reagents
the reagents used in this study are described in the online
supplementary material.  xxxd2985xxx  ( xxxd2985xxx ),  xxxd1815xxx , and
 xxxd2642xxx  ( xxxd2642xxx ) were purchased from chemietek
(indianapolis, in, usa), and cladribine from janssen cilag
(titusville, nj, usa).

evaluation of drug-induced apoptosis
hmc-1 cells were incubated with various concentrations of
 xxxd2985xxx  (0.001-1 mm) or control medium at 37°c for 24 h. the
percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified by morphological criteria (light microscopy), cleavage of  xxxg341xxx  (western blot analysis, flow cytometry or by an in situ  xxxg647xxx -mediated
dutp-fluorescence nick end-labeling (tunel) assay. the technical details are described in the online supplementary material.

design and application of small interfering rna
short interfering (si)rna directed against btk or luciferase
(online supplementary table s2; online supplementary material)
were transfected into hmc-1.2 cells as described elsewhere.20
thereafter, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 300
nm  xxxd2985xxx  for 24 h. the knockdown of btk after sirna transfection was confirmed by western blotting. the percentage of
apoptotic cells was determined by light microscopy.

statistical analysis
to determine the significance of differences in proliferation and
apoptosis in drug-exposed hmc-1 cells, student’s t test was
applied. results were considered statistically significant when the
p value was less than 0.05. drug-interactions (additive, synergistic)
were determined by calculating the combination index (ci) values
using calcusyn software (calcusyn; biosoft, ferguson, mo).28 a
ci value of 1 indicates an additive effect, whereas a ci below 1
indicates synergistic drug effects.

results
hmc-1 cells expressing or lacking kit d816v
hmc-1 cells27 were kindly provided by dr. jh butterfield (mayo
clinic, rochester, ma, usa) and were cultured as described in the
online supplementary material.

isolation of primary neoplastic cells
primary neoplastic cells were obtained from four patients with
kit d816v+ indolent sm, five with kit d816v+ aggressive sm,
and one with mcl and were isolated as described in the online
supplementary material. the patients’ characteristics are shown in
table 1. all patients gave written informed consent. the study
was approved by the local institutional review board and was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki.

western blotting
hmc-1 cells were incubated with  xxxd2985xxx  (0.001-1 mm),
 xxxd2642xxx  (0.05-0.1 mm), or control medium at 37°c for 4 h.
thereafter, cells were harvested and western blotting was performed as described14 using the antibodies shown in online
supplementary table s1.

 xxxd2985xxx  blocks the phosphorylation of key proteins
in neoplastic mast cells
as assessed by western blotting,  xxxd2985xxx  was found to
inhibit the phosphorylation of kit, lyn and stat 5 in
hmc-1.1 and hmc-1.2 cells (figure 1a,b, online
supplementary figure s1). in hmc-1.2 cells, relatively high
concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  (1 mm) were required to inhibit
kit-phosphorylation, suggesting that the d816v mutation
induces relative resistance against this drug. however, the

two other relevant signaling molecules examined, namely
p-lyn and p- xxxg2216xxx , were substantially down-regulated by
 xxxd2985xxx  at low concentrations (0.1 mm) in both subclones.
no effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on expression of p-btk were seen.
together, these results suggest that  xxxd2985xxx  may exert
antineoplastic effects (at pharmacological concentrations) in
neoplastic mc lacking or harboring kit d816v. in kit
d816v-positive subclones, at least some of the effect of
 xxxd2985xxx  may be exerted via kit-independent targets.

 xxxd2985xxx  inhibits the proliferation of hmc-1 cells
and primary neoplastic mast cells
to explore the effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on the proliferation
of neoplastic mc, 3h-thymidine uptake experiments were
performed using hmc-1 cells and primary neoplastic mc.
as shown in figure 2a,  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited the proliferation of both hmc-1 subclones in a dose-dependent manner, with 100-fold higher ic50 values in hmc-1 cells harboring kit d816v than in cells lacking kit d816v. in primary kit codon 816-mutated mc isolated from patients
with indolent sm, aggressive sm or mcl,  xxxd2985xxx  was
also found to inhibit proliferation, with ic50 values ranging
between 0.05 and 0.5 mm (table 1, figure 2b-2f). these
ic50 values correspond to ic50 values found in hmc-1.2
cells rather than to ic50 values obtained in hmc-1.1 cells.

 xxxd2985xxx  induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in hmc-1 cells
to explore the mechanism of  xxxd2985xxx -induced growth
inhibition, we measured the cell cycle and survival in
hmc-1 cells treated with  xxxd2985xxx .  xxxd2985xxx  was found
to induce a g1 cell cycle arrest in both hmc-1 subclones
(data not shown). moreover,  xxxd2985xxx  induced apoptosis in
both hmc-1 subclones in a dose-dependent manner as
assessed by light microscopy. as expected, higher concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  were required to induce apoptosis in
hmc-1.2 cells than in hmc-1.1 cells (figures 3a,b). the
 xxxd2985xxx -induced apoptosis in hmc-1 cells was confirmed by measuring an increase in cleaved caspase-3
(figure 3c). furthermore,  xxxd2985xxx -induced apoptosis in
hmc-1 cells was confirmed by  xxxg166xxx / xxxd3027xxx 
iodide staining and flow cytometry (figure 3d) as well as
by the tunel assay (figure 3e).

 xxxd2985xxx  cooperates with  xxxd2642xxx  and cladribine in
producing growth inhibition and apoptosis in hmc-1 cells
we next asked whether  xxxd2985xxx  would act synergistically with  xxxd2642xxx  in inhibiting the proliferation and
viability of neoplastic mc. as assessed by 3h-thymidine
uptake, a combination of suboptimal concentrations of
both compounds resulted in complete growth inhibition
in hmc-1 cells (figure 4a,b). furthermore, synergism was
demonstrable in primary neoplastic mc isolated from a
patient suffering from indolent sm-chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, in whom neoplastic monocytes also
express kit d816v (figure 4c) and mc derived from a
patient with aggressive sm (figure 4d). as shown in
figure 4e and 4f, synergistic drug interactions between
 xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx  were also observed when
apoptosis was analyzed as a “read out”. synergistic drug
interactions were confirmed using calcusyn software.
examples of resulting ci values are shown in online
supplementary figure s2. ci values of less than 1, indicating
synergistic drug effects, are highlighted by an asterisk in
figure 4a-4f. as assessed by western blot analysis, the
combination of both compounds, when applied at suboptimal combinations, resulted in dephosphorylation of kit,
lyn and  xxxg2216xxx  (figure 4g). we also investigated whether
 xxxd2985xxx  would synergize with cladribine, a drug that has
been shown to exert clear antineoplastic effects in sm in
vitro and in vivo.29,30 as assessed by 3h-thymidine uptake, a
combination of these two drugs also resulted in synergistic
growth inhibition in hmc-1.2 cells (online supplementary
figure s3).

silencing of btk with small interfering rna enhances
the pro-apoptotic effect of  xxxd2985xxx  in hmc-1 cells
we have recently demonstrated that btk plays a role in
kit d816v-independent survival of neoplastic mc.20 in
the current study,  xxxd2985xxx  failed to inhibit p-btk in
hmc-1 cells (figure 1a). we therefore hypothesized that
an induced knock-down of btk may potentiate the proapoptotic effects of  xxxd2985xxx  in hmc-1 cells. to test this
hypothesis, hmc-1.2 cells were treated with sirna
directed against btk, and were then exposed to control
medium or  xxxd2985xxx . figure 5a shows that this combined
treatment resulted in inhibition of p-kit and btk.

kit, phosphorylated lyn (p-lyn), lyn, phosphorylated btk (p-btk) or

effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on neoplastic mast cells

furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that  xxxd2985xxx 
synergizes with btk-sirna in inducing apoptosis in
hmc-1 cells (figure 5b). this observation suggests that
pharmacological inhibitors of btk may also represent suitable combination partners for  xxxd2985xxx  in advanced sm.
since  xxxd1815xxx  has been described to block btk,20 we finally applied combinations of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx .
indeed, we found that both drugs exert synergistic
growth-inhibitory effects in hmc-1 cells (figure 5c,d).

discussion
 xxxd2985xxx  is a novel promising tki that has been developed for the treatment of advanced drug-resistant chronic
myeloid leukemia.23 the target spectrum of  xxxd2985xxx  is
broad and includes kit and several oncogenic downstream kinases. in patients with heavily pretreated
philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias,  xxxd2985xxx 
was found to be highly effective.26 in the current study, we
examined the effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on growth and survival
of neoplastic human mc. our data show that  xxxd2985xxx 
exerts major growth-inhibitory effects in primary neoplastic mc as well as in hmc-1 cells. our data also suggest
that the kit mutant d816v introduces partial resistance

against  xxxd2985xxx , confirming previously published
results.25 finally, our data show that  xxxd2985xxx  and
 xxxd2642xxx  as well as  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  synergize
with each other in producing growth-inhibitory effects on
neoplastic mc.
various different studies have shown that  xxxd2985xxx , at
low (nm) concentrations, inhibits the proliferation of
leukemic cells in patients with chronic myeloid
leukemia.23 in our experiments we were able to show that
 xxxd2985xxx  inhibits the proliferation of neoplastic mc
derived from advanced sm, including hmc-1 cells.
however, 100-fold higher concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx 
were required to inhibit the proliferation of hmc-1.2 cells
exhibiting kit d816v compared to hmc-1.1 cells lacking
kit d816v. this observation confirms those of a previous
study25 and suggests that the d816v mutant introduces
relative resistance against  xxxd2985xxx . however, unlike
other tki, such as imatinib or  xxxd2724xxx , complete growth
inhibition of primary neoplastic mc expressing kit
d816v, was still demonstrable using  xxxd2985xxx  at pharmacologically meaningful concentrations. this is best
explained by the additional effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on other
key signaling molecules, including lyn and  xxxg2216xxx , known
to be expressed in activated form in these cells as well as
in hmc-1.1 and hmc-1.2 cells.20

figure 3.  xxxd2985xxx  induces apoptosis in hmc-1 cells. (a). hmc-1.1 cells
and (b) hmc-1.2 cells were incubated in control medium or in various concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  (hmc-1.1: 1–20 nm; hmc-1.2 cells: 0.2–1 mm),
as indicated, for 24 h. thereafter, the percentage of apoptotic cells was
determined by light microscopy. (c). hmc-1.1 cells and hmc-1.2 cells
were incubated in control medium or in various concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  (hmc-1.1: 0.02 or 0.05 mm; hmc-1.2: 1 or 5 mm) for 24 h. after incubation, cells were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies
directed against cleaved caspase-3 or b-actin (loading control). (d) hmc1.2 cells were incubated in control medium or in the presence of 1 mm
 xxxd2985xxx  for 24 h and thereafter analyzed by flow cytometry. (e) after 24
h of incubation in control medium or in medium containing 0.05 mm
(hmc-1.1) or 1 mm (hmc-1.2)  xxxd2985xxx , apoptosis was determined by the
tunel assay, as described in the text.

in a next step, we explored the mechanism of ponatinibinduced growth inhibition in hmc-1 cells. growth inhibition was accompanied by cell cycle arrest and by induction of apoptosis as assessed by light microscopy, flow
cytomery, the tunel assay, and analysis of caspase-3
cleavage. these data suggest that  xxxd2985xxx  exerts growthinhibitory effects on neoplastic mc through multiple
mechanisms, which points to a broad spectrum of relevant
(and responding) targets in these cells.
we have recently described that neoplastic mc in
advanced sm express several kit-dependent and -independent downstream signaling molecules, including activated (phosphorylated) lyn, btk and  xxxg2216xxx .20,31 in the current study,  xxxd2985xxx  was found to inhibit p-lyn and pstat5 in both hmc-1 subclones at reasonable (and comparable) drug concentrations (nm range). a somehow surprising result was that  xxxd2985xxx  failed to block p-btk, a
kinase that has been shown to contribute to survival of
neoplastic mc.20 this observation prompted us to test
combinations between sirna directed against btk and
 xxxd2985xxx  in neoplastic mc. since  xxxd1815xxx  has been
described to bind to btk and to block btk activity in neoplastic cells,32-34 we also examined the effects of a combina1454

tion of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx . indeed, we found that
both drugs, when combined, exert synergistic growthinhibitory effects on neoplastic mc. all in all, our data
suggest that btk is a relevant target mediating the synergism between  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , whereas synergism between  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx  may be best
explained by other differentially recognized targets, such
as lyn which is blocked by  xxxd2985xxx  but not by
 xxxd2642xxx .20
during the past few years, a number of different kit-targeting agents, including  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx , have
been tested in clinical trials with the aim of blocking malignant mc growth in patients with aggressive sm and
mcl.17-19 with regards to btk,  xxxd1815xxx  is of particular
interest. indeed, it has been described that  xxxd1815xxx  blocks
lyn and btk activity in neoplastic mc.20 however, because
of its short half-life and side effects,  xxxd1815xxx  is not expected to exert major sustained clinical effects in patients with
advanced sm. indeed, the first clinical studies with  xxxd1815xxx  were rather disappointing.18  xxxd2642xxx  has recently
been described to counteract neoplastic cell growth in
patients with aggressive sm and mcl, and data from currently ongoing clinical trials are very encouraging.35

however, unfortunately, the effects of this drug are often
short-lived and are frequently followed by a relapse.17,19
 xxxd2642xxx  may, therefore, not be very useful as a single
agent to treat patients with advanced sm.
the relative resistance against  xxxd2642xxx  may be due
to additional (kit-independent) oncogenic molecules and
pathways that are activated in neoplastic mc and contribute to the survival of neoplastic mc.20-22 these pathways are not inhibited by  xxxd2642xxx  and may, therefore,
contribute to disease progression despite treatment. a
combination between  xxxd2642xxx  and other agents, such
as  xxxd2985xxx , could, therefore, be an interesting approach
to optimize therapy in these patients.
 xxxd2985xxx  may be a suitable combination partner for

cells were subjected to
western blot analysis
using antibodies against
p-kit, kit, p-lyn, lyn, pstat5 or  xxxg2216xxx .

 xxxd2642xxx  for several reasons. first, the target spectra of
the two drugs differ. indeed, we were able to demonstrate
that  xxxd2642xxx  and  xxxd2985xxx  block a number of antiapoptotic kinases in hmc-1 cells, including p-kit, p-lyn
and p- xxxg2216xxx , when applied as a drug combination even at
suboptimal concentrations. furthermore, depending on
the presence and type of kit mutations,  xxxd2985xxx  inhibits
kit phosphorylation and thereby may contribute to suppression of abnormal cell survival. we therefore investigated whether the combination “ xxxd2642xxx + xxxd2985xxx ”
would act cooperatively or even synergistically in inducing growth inhibition and cell death in neoplastic mc. we
were able to demonstrate that  xxxd2642xxx  and  xxxd2985xxx 
synergize with each other in inducing growth inhibition

and apoptosis in hmc-1 cells. we were also able to show
that the two drugs applied,  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx ,
exert strong cooperative effects on phosphorylation of
common targets such as kit or  xxxg2216xxx . we therefore
hypothesize that synergistic drug interactions on cell proliferation and viability result from both the cooperative
effects on common targets and the inhibitory effects on
kinases differentially recognized by either  xxxd2642xxx  or
 xxxd2985xxx .
we then investigated whether  xxxd2985xxx  also exerts
growth-inhibitory effects on primary neoplastic mc. as
for hmc-1.2 cells, growth inhibition of primary neoplastic mc was observed in all samples examined, with ic50
values <0.5 mm in kit d816v+ patients. notably, in half of
the patients analyzed (5 out of 10), including two patients
with aggressive sm, even 100 nm of  xxxd2985xxx  induced
significant growth arrest. this is of particular interest,
since in a dose escalation study, 45 mg daily (corresponding to a mean peak plasma concentration of 145 nm) was
the dose recommended for further clinical trials.26 we also
examined combinations of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx  on
primary patient-derived cells. again, we were able to
show that both drugs cooperate with each other in blocking the proliferation of primary neoplastic mc. since
these two drugs,  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx , differ in their
structure, their target spectrum, and in known (reported)
side-effect profiles, a combination may be a potent and
better tolerated treatment option for patients with aggressive sm or mcl. these findings are promising since the
response to chemotherapy and targeted drugs in patients
with aggressive sm or mcl is usually poor, which points
to the need to develop new antineoplastic agents and therapeutic concepts. the question is how to apply  xxxd2985xxx

in patients with advanced sm. one reasonable maneuver
may be to administer  xxxd2985xxx  in patients with  xxxd2642xxx -resistant disease, with the hope that the remaining
(often kit d816v-negative17) subclones respond better to
 xxxd2985xxx  than to  xxxd2642xxx . another possibility could
be to combine  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx  directly in
patients with advanced sm. our data would be in favor of
such an approach. however, for the moment, this possibility remains hypothetical. in fact, clinical trials using  xxxd2985xxx  as a single agent in advanced sm are now warranted
in order to document clinical activity in these patients,
before combination trials can be planned.
our study shows that the multi-kinase inhibitor  xxxd2985xxx  exerts anti-neoplastic effects on hmc-1 cells and primary neoplastic mc derived from patients with advanced
sm. in addition,  xxxd2985xxx  was found to potentiate the
effects of  xxxd2642xxx , a drug that is currently used quite
successfully to treat patients with aggressive sm or mcl.
whether combinations of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd2642xxx  or
 xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  can be used in vivo in patients with
aggressive sm and mcl and can produce synergistic
effects remains at present unknown.
