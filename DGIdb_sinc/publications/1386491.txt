candoxatri~ is a novel, orally active inhibitor of
neutral wdase
 xxxg1417xxx , the enzyme
that degrades atrial natriuretk peptide (anp). the
acute and chronk (10 days hatment)
hemodynamk and hormonal effects of candoxatrii (130
mg twke daily) in 12 patients with moderately severe congestive heart failure were investigated in
double-blind
a ra@emixed, pk cebo-controlled,
study. on study day 1,  xxxd419xxx  acutely increased plasma anp levelq suppressed aldosta
rene and decreased right atrial and pulmonary
capilhry wedge pressures after 10 days of treatment, hasacllanp was increased and basal aldosterone was decreased. body weight was reduced,
most likely refkcting chronk natriuretk or diuretic effects, or both, and there was a trend toward
increased cardiac index and reduced preload values. on study day 10, the acute effects of candexatril were similar to those on day 1 (le., anp was
further increased, aldosterone was suppressed,
and right and left ventrkular filling pressures
were decreased). thus,  xxxd419xxx  may offer a
new and effective therapeutk
approach in the
treatment of heart failure.

pplication of atria1 natriuretic peptide (anp)
exerts beneficial hemodynamic, hormonal and
renal effects in patients with congestive heart failure,1-5 but its clinical use is liited by the need of intravenous application. therefore, orally active anp analogs or inhibitors of anp degradation have been
searched for. recently, the neutral metalloendopeptidase  xxxg1417xxx  has been identified as the major
anp degrading enzyme,6v7which cleaves anp 99-126
at the cys105-phe1mbond. inhibition of endopeptidase by
(f)- xxxd420xxx 
in animals819 and normal vohmteers9jo results in enhanced plasma anp concentrations producing effects similar to low-dose anp infusion. beneficial acute hemodynamic and renal effects of
(f)- xxxd420xxx ,
a compound requiring intravenous
infusion, have been reported in patients with heart failure.9j1 recently, the oral prodrug  xxxd419xxx  has been
developed, which is hydrolyzed to release the active endopeptidase inhibitor (&)- xxxd420xxx . this new drug
might promise a novel and feasible approach in heart
failure therapy, but so far its effectiveness has not been
demonstrated in patients. therefore, in a placebo-controlled, doubleblind study we tested the effects of acute
and prolonged inhibition of ec 24.11 by  xxxd419xxx  in
patients with congestive heart failure.

a

this investigation was a randomized, placebcontrolled, doubleblind study, approved by the hospital’s
ethics committee. after giving informed consent, 12 patients (10 men, 2 women), aged 34 to 71 years, with
stable functional classes ii and iii congestive heart failure according to the new york heart association trite
ria and an ejection fraction of <45% and >2c% took
part. of these patients 4 had coronary artery disease,
and 8 had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. all patients had normal renal function and were clinically and
hemodynamically stable.
study protoceh six days before commencing the
study, all medication except for digitalis, diuretics and
warfarin was discontinued. the dose of diuretics was
kept constant throughout the study. the patients were
kept on a normal diet with normal sodium intake. three
days before the study, a thorough clinical examination
and routine laboratory tests were performed before
starting a 2-day placebo run-in phase. one day before
the study, basal laboratory and clinical parameters including body weight were assessedand a bicycle exercise test was performed. starting at 25 w, the work
load was increased by 25 w every 120 seconds until the
standard end points, i.e., dyspnea and fatigue, were
reached. on study day 1  xxxd2274xxx :30 a.m., right-sided cardiaugust

ac catheterization was performed from the right or left
antecubital vein using a 7fr swan-ganz thermodilution
catheter with the patients in a fasted state and in supine
position. after a resting period of 30 minutes, hemodynamic measurements were performed and blood was
sampled from the pulmonary artery for hormone determinations. then the patients took 3 capsules of either
50 mg  xxxd419xxx  (pfiir, sandwich, united kingdom)
or of placebo. thirty, 60 and 90 minutes thereafter, he
modynamic measurements and blood sampling were repeated. after the last measurement, the catheter was
removed. two, 3 and 4 hours after drug administration
blood was taken from an indwelling cannula in a forearm vein for determination of anp levels. the patients
took either placebo or 150 mg of  xxxd419xxx  at 8 a.m.
and 8 p.m. for the next 10 days. on study day 5, routine
laboratory tests were performed and body weight taken.
on day 10  xxxd2274xxx :30 a.m., another right-sided cardiac
catheterization was performed, i.e., the baseline values
were determined 12 hours after the previous evening
dose. thereafter, another dose of the drug or placebo
was given and the identical protocol as on day 1 was
applied. on study day 11, body weight was measured
and blood sampled for routine measurements in a fasted
state and, 2 hours after the morning dose of placebo or
 xxxd419xxx , a bicycle stress test was performed as previously described. this ended the study.
m
systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were determined with a standard sphygmomanometer and used to calculate mean arterial pressure by
the standard formula. pulmonary arterial, right atria1
and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were obtained
using the swan-ganz catheter connected to a statham
p23 pressure transducer and recorded on a thermograph recorder. cardiac output was determined in trip
licate by the thermodilution technique. cardiac index,
systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were calculated using the standard formulas.
plasma levels of anp, renin and aldosterone were
measured by radioimmunoassay
as previously described.12 plasma norepinephrine concentration was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
with electrochemical detection. extraction from plasma
was performed using the standard technique as described.‘3

all values are expressed as mean f sem.
after a normal distribution of the assessedparameters
was excluded using the kolmogorov-smimov goodnessof-fit test, nonparametric procedures were applied. differences within groups were analyzed using wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test, and differences be
tween groups were analyzed using mann-whitney uwilcoxon rank sum w test.14 correlation coefficients
were obtained by linear regression analysis (method of
least-squares). statistical significance was accepted at p

anp, renin, aldosterone and norepinephrine were elevated. anp levels were significantly correlated to pulmonary capillary wedge pressures at baseline on study
day 1 (r = 0.80, p <o.ol) and inversely correlated to
ejection fraction (r = -0.66, p <o.ol). there was no
significant difference in basal values between the placebo group and the patients receiving  xxxd419xxx .

1): on day 1,  xxxd419xxx  elevated anp plasma levels
by about threefold with the peak effect observed 90
minutes after drug application. these changes were
highly significant compared with both baseline and placebo. anp levels at baseline on day 10 (i.e., 12 hours
after the last dose) were significantly elevated compared
with basal values of day 1 (p <0.05) as well with placebo.  xxxd419xxx  induced a further significant increase
reaching similar values as on day 1.
acute offsets (fl

no changes in aldosterone levels were observed in the
placebo group. there was a slight but significant de
crease in plasma renin concentration 60 minutes after
 xxxd419xxx  on day 1 (by 0.7 f 0.2 ngai/ml/hour)
and
90 minutes after  xxxd419xxx  on day 10 (by 1.2 f 0.9

however, similar changes were also

on day 1 but were significant 60 minutes after application on day 10 (decrease by 1.4 f 0.7 ngai/ml/hour).
plasma norepinephrine was not affected by  xxxd419xxx 
or placebo.  xxxd419xxx  significantly reduced right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures on both

chronic effects (figure 3): in the  xxxd419xxx  group
there was a tendency toward lower basal pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure on day 10, which was not sign&ant, and for elevated cardiac index, which reached
borderline significance (p = 0.08). compared with base
line on day 1, basal aldosterone levels on day 10 were
significantly suppressed, and basal renin and norepinephrine levels were unchanged.  xxxd419xxx  treatment
significantly reduced body weight from 73.7 f 5.5 kg
on day -1 to 72.2 f 5.2 kg on day 5 and to 71.8 f 4.1
kg on day 11 (p <0.05). hematocrit was significantly
increased (from 39 f 2% on day -1 to 42 f 3% on day
5; p <0.05), but returned to 39 f 3% on day 11. similarly, total protein concentration was increased from 7.0
f 0.3 (day 1) to 7.4 f 0.2 g/d1 (day 5) with borderline
significance (p = 0.07) and was 7.1 f 0.3 on day 11.
exercise time was increased from 327 f 50 to 367 f 67
seconds without reaching the level of significance. there
were no chronic changes observed in the placebo group.
 xxxd419xxx  was well tolerated by all patients, and no
adverse effects were noted.

discussion
in patients with congestive heart failure, the new
orally active endopeptidase inhibitor  xxxd419xxx  markedly increased endogenous anp plasma levels. after 10
days of oral treatment, basal anp concentrations were
still elevated 12 hours after the last dose, demonstrating
long-lasting effectiveness of  xxxd419xxx . although in
heart failure, anp levels are increased at baseline and
anp effects are bl,ted,3,4j2 we observed significant
biologic effects of the endopeptidase inhibitor. it cannot
be totally excluded that enhancement. of 1 or more potential substrates other than anp might participate in
the observed
effects, since the  xxxg1417xxx  ec
24.11 is also capable of in vivo cleavage of bradykinin,
vip, encephalin and  xxxg2240xxx .is however, the effects of  xxxd419xxx  in our study closely resemble those
of exogenous anp infusions in patients with heart failure.2.4y5pretreatment with anp antisera in animals

endopeptidase inhibition by (f)- xxxd420xxx ,8 which is

the active form of the prodrug  xxxd419xxx . this indicates that the biologic effects of  xxxd419xxx  are, at least
for the greatest part, due to elevated anp concentrations.
aldosterone was significantly suppressed by  xxxd419xxx  on both study days, which may be attributed
to direct inhibitory effects of anp on the adrenal
glandsi basal aldosterone plasma concentrations were
significantly lowered after 10 days of treatment, documenting effectiveness of the long-lasting anp elevations.  xxxd419xxx  markedly decreased right and left
ventricular filling pressures without affecting blood
pressure and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances. possible mechanisms for this predominantly preload lowering effect include an increase in venous capacitance due to direct venodilatory effects, an increased resistance to venous return, and a decrease in
blood volume either due to diuretic and natriuretic effects or a transcapillary fluid shift from plasma to extravascular compartments.
after chronic treatment with  xxxd419xxx , we observed a trend toward a long lasting reduction in left
ventricular preload and an increase in cardiac index.
however, owing to the small sample size and to the relatively short duration of the trial, these changes did not
reach statistical significance. in addition, there was a
slight, but insignificant increase in total exercise time.
body weight was significantly and markedly reduced after 10 days of treatment. although other potential
mechanisms cannot totally be excluded, this most likely
reflects a negative fluid balance due to increased diuresis or natriuresis, or both. such effects have been demonstrated acutely after single doses of  xxxd419xxx  in
normal humansi and of (f)- xxxd420xxx 
in patients
with heart failure. l l a transient volume contraction was
indicated by an increase in hematocrit on day 5, but
was no longer observed on day 11.

compared with our study, in which elevations of endogenous anp were induced, high doses of exogenous
anp decreased filling pressures and increased cardiac
output in patients with heart failure,‘m5 most likely due
to a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. natriuretic and diuretic responses were observed in some2$5
but not all studies, possibly because of the different dosages used, and were markedly attenuated compared
with responses in healthy control subjects.3-5 the striking difference compared with our study is the decrease
in systemic vascular resistance and subsequent increase
in cardiac output, which was not observed in our patients. in accordance with our results,  xxxd419xxx  did
not acutely affect afterload as determined by left ventricular hydraulic load in patients with heart failure.18
the most likely reason for this discrepancy is that very
high anp plasma levels may be required for arteriolar
dilatation; these levels were 64 to 39 times5 higher than
basal values during the anp infusion studies compared
with the threefold elevations induced by  xxxd419xxx . it
appears that even larger doses of  xxxd419xxx  do not elevate anp concentrations to levels sufficiently high to
lower afterload.i8
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd419xxx  suppressed aldosterone and renin and increased natriuresis without affecting blood pressure,r7 which is consistent with our
findings in patients with heart failure. marked diuretic
and natriuretic effects of endopeptidase inhibition were
demonstrated in dogs with experimental heart failure, in
which the renal effects of exogenously applied anp
were markedly attenuated. l9 in agreement with our results, a decrease in plasma renin activity and in puhnonary capillary wedge pressure have been observed after
short-term administration of the endopeptidase inhibitor
sinorphan in patients with heart failure.20 short-term
intravenous infusions of (f)- xxxd420xxx 
in such patients9j1 acutely increased anp levels by about three-

fold (which is similar to the changes found in our
study), reduced right and left ventricular filling pressures and increased diuresis and natriuresis. these results support the indirect evidence in our study given by
the reduction in body weight that chronic treatment
with  xxxd419xxx  may increase diuresis or natriuresis, or
both, in patients with heart failure.
in conclusion, endopeptidase inhibition by  xxxd419xxx  exerts a beneficial profile of acute and chronic hemodynamic, hormonal and renal effects in patients with
heart failure. therefore, this drug may offer a new and
effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of
chronic congestive heart failure.
