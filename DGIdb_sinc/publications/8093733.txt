 xxxd1708xxx  and 5-hydroxytryptamine enhance motility in the canine antrum via separate pathways, not involving 5-hydroxytryptamine1,2,3,4 receptors.  prokinetic benzamides (e.g.,  xxxd1708xxx ) enhance gastrointestinal motility and transit. in vitro studies on the guinea pig ileum suggest that their effect is mediated via serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine ( xxxg1117xxx ) receptors, resulting in a facilitation of cholinergic neurotransmission. however, most in vivo studies have been performed on the canine stomach. therefore, our aim was to determine whether the findings obtained on the guinea pig ileum can be extrapolated to another species and another organ. does a benzamide facilitate cholinergic neutrotransmission on strips of the canine stomach in vitro? if so, does the benzamide exert its effect via a serotonergic  xxxg1117xxx  mechanism? longitudinal muscle strips with adhering myenteric plexus were isolated from the canine stomach and were electrically stimulated at submaximal frequencies resulting in a mean contractile response of 16 +/- 7% of the response to  xxxd2586xxx  (10(-6) m). atropine and tetrodotoxin (both 3 x 10(-7) m) abolished the contractile responses, whereas hexamethonium (10(-4) m) had no effect.  xxxd1708xxx  (3 x 10(-7) m) enhanced the contractile responses from 14 to 70% (59 +/- 5% increase). 5-ht (3 x 10(-7) m) similarly enhanced the responses from 12 to 72% (58 +/- 5% increase).  xxxd1708xxx  induced a sustained enhancement throughout the duration of the experiment; in contrast, the effect of 5-ht subsided in about 90 min. single-concentration administration of  xxxd1708xxx  (10(-8)-10(-6) m) and 5-ht (10(-9)-3 x 10(-7) m) resulted in ec50 values of 1.0 (0.8-1.4) x 10(-7) m for  xxxd1708xxx  and 1.3 (0.8-2.1) x 10(-8) m for 5-ht. methiothepin and  xxxd2621xxx  (both 3 x 10(-7) m; 5-ht1-receptor antagonists),  xxxd2419xxx  and ly 53857 (both 3 x 10(-7) m; 5-ht2-receptor antagonists), granisetron (3 x 10(-7) m; 5-ht3-receptor antagonist) or ics 205-930 (3 x 10(-7) m; 5-ht3-receptor antagonist and in addition  xxxg1117xxx -receptor antagonist at 3 x 10(-6) m) did not reduce the responses to both  xxxd1708xxx  and 5-ht. 1-(1-naphthalenyl)piperazine (10(-6) m; 5-ht-receptor antagonist in the rat gastric fundus) significantly reduced the increase by 5-ht (24 +/- 7%; 7-31%) but had no effect on the  xxxd1708xxx  (3 x 10(-7) m)-induced increase (69 +/- 4%; 8-77%).(abstract truncated at 400 words).
