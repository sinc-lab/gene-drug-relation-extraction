 xxxd3223xxx  binds to its membrane receptor (ghr), whereby
it regulates many cellular functions, including proliferation,
differentiation and chemotaxis. however, although the activation
of  xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling is well understood, the
precise mechanism responsible for its regulation has not been
elucidated. here, we demonstrate that phospholipase cgamma1
(plcgamma1) modulates the action of  xxxd3223xxx -mediated
signalling by interacting with  xxxg2198xxx  jak2 (janus kinase
2) in a  xxxd3223xxx -dependent manner. in the absence of
plcgamma1 (plcgamma1–/–),  xxxd3223xxx -induced jak2 and  xxxg2216xxx 
phosphorylation significantly increased in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (mefs). furthermore, the re-expression of plcgamma1
reduced  xxxd3223xxx -induced jak2 activation. growth
hormone-induced jak2 phosphorylation was enhanced by sirnaspecific knockdown of plcgamma1. interestingly, plcgamma1 physically
linked jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx  ( xxxg1893xxx ) by
binding to both using different domains, and this process was
implicated in the modulation of cytokine signalling through
jak2. in addition, in plcgamma1–/– mefs,  xxxd3223xxx -dependent
c-fos activation was upregulated and  xxxd3223xxx -induced
proliferation was potentiated. these results suggest that plcgamma1
has a key function in the regulation of  xxxd3223xxx -mediated
signalling by negatively regulating jak2 activation.
 xxxd3223xxx , secreted by the anterior pituitary into the circulation, promotes postnatal growth by acting directly on tissues (such
as liver and bone) and by stimulating the synthesis of insulin-like
growth factor-1 (igf-1)1. the interaction between  xxxd3223xxx 
and  xxxd3223xxx  receptors (ghrs) on target cells promotes the
association of cellular  xxxg2198xxx  jak2 with the cytoplasmic domain
of ghr, which initiates the tyrosine phosphorylation of ghr and the
activation of jak2 by autophosphorylation2. consequently, the growth

hormone-stimulated activation of signal transducers and activators of
transcription (stats 1, 3, 5a and 5b) leads to their dimerization, nuclear
translocation, dna binding and the activation of transcription3,4. the
precise control of ghr signal transduction requires limitation of the
magnitude and duration of the signalling through negative regulation.
however, the specific regulatory mechanisms of growth hormonemediated signalling have yet to be determined.
plc hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to generate
inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (dag), which
are implicated in the mobilization of intracellular ca2+ and protein kinase
c activation, respectively5. unlike other plc isotypes, the plcgamma enzymes
contain two src homology (sh) 2 domains and one sh3 domain between
the x and y catalytic domains6, and these three domains have been implicated in the regulation of cellular proliferation and growth7–9. specifically,
 xxxd3223xxx  has been demonstrated to increase plc activity and
 xxxd3223xxx -induced dag formation has been found to be inhibited
by  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors10–12. however, growth-hormone treatment
does not always result in the concomitant elevation of intracellular ip3
and/or dag13. therefore, it is necessary to characterize precisely the role
of plc in the  xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling pathway.
we first investigated the effect of  xxxd3223xxx  on the tyrosine
phosphorylation of plcgamma1: plcgamma1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated on adding  xxxd3223xxx  in a dose- and time-dependent manner (fig. 1a,
b). as jak2 is essential for ghr-mediated signal transduction4, the role
of jak2 in the  xxxd3223xxx -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
plcgamma1 was assessed. the ectopic expression of wild-type jak2 increased
plcgamma1 phosphorylation, and the expression of kinase inactive jak2dn
significantly suppressed  xxxd3223xxx -induced plcgamma1 phosphorylation (fig. 1c). furthermore, jak2 potentiated the growth hormoneinduced enzymatic activity of plcgamma1 (fig. 1d). taken together, these
results suggest that plcgamma1 is activated by  xxxd3223xxx , and that
jak2 is a critical kinase for the activation of plcgamma1.

indicated times, lysed and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antijak2 (e) and anti-plcgamma1 (f) antibodies. precipitates were analysed using
anti-plcgamma1 and jak2 antibodies reciprocally. (g) schematic representation
of the structure of flag-tagged wild-type plcgamma1, the lipase-inactive

with  xxxd3223xxx . cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antiflag antibodies and the precipitates were analysed with anti-jak2 and antiflag antibodies. (i) nih3t3 cells expressing plcgamma1 and various mutants
were labelled with myo-3h-inositol in inositol-free medium for 24 h, and
treated with  xxxd3223xxx  for 1 min. insp3 generation was measured as
described in the methods. the error bars represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3).

to determine the possible role of plcgamma1 in  xxxd3223xxx -mediated
signalling pathway, we attempted to identify the protein that interacts
with the sh domain of plcgamma1 after  xxxd3223xxx  treatment. malditof mass spectrometry showed that jak2 kinase specifically interacted
with the sh2–sh2 domain of plcgamma1 in nih3t3 cells (data not shown).
jak2 was also found to specifically coimmunoprecipitate with plcgamma1 in
a  xxxd3223xxx -dependent manner (fig. 1e, f). to identify the region
of plcgamma1 responsible for binding to jak2, point mutants were generated
in each sh domain of plcgamma1 (plcgamma1r586k, plcgamma1r694k and plcgamma1p842l)
and a lipase-inactive mutant (plcgamma1lim), in which his 335 was replaced
with glutamine14 (fig. 1g). plcgamma1 specifically interacted with jak2 and

the enzymatic activity of plcgamma1 was not responsible for the interaction
between plcgamma1 and jak2 (fig. 1h). interestingly, plcgamma1 mutation at
arg 586 completely blocked its interaction with jak2. in addition, growth
hormone-induced enzymatic activity of plcgamma1lim or plcgamma1r586k was
completely abolished (fig. 1i). taken together, these results indicate that
the amino-terminal sh2 domain of plcgamma1 is critical for its interaction
with jak2 in a  xxxd3223xxx -dependent manner, and this interaction
is essential for plcgamma1 activation by  xxxd3223xxx .
to determine the specific role of plcgamma1 in the  xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling pathway, we used spontaneously immortalized mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) isolated from wild-type and plcgamma1–/–

phosphorylation of ghr was enhanced in knockout mefs, indicating
that plcgamma1 suppresses  xxxd3223xxx -induced ghr activation by
inhibiting jak2 (fig. 2c). it is well known that activated ghr rapidly
internalizes into endosomes after  xxxd3223xxx  stimulation16, therefore we examined the internalization of ghr by confocal microscopy.
compared with the wild-type mefs, knockout mefs showed elevated
levels of ghr in intracellular vesicular compartments after  xxxd3223xxx  treatment, suggesting that plcgamma1 negatively regulates the growth
hormone-mediated signalling pathway (fig. 2d).
to investigate the specificity of the inhibitory role of plcgamma1 on
cytokine-mediated signal transduction, we treated both wild-type and
knockout mefs with il-6. it has been reported that interleukin-6 ( xxxg1181xxx ) induces homodimerization of the il-6 receptor gp130, which leads
to association with one or more members of the jak-family tyrosine
kinases, such as  xxxg1219xxx , jak2,  xxxg1221xxx , and  xxxg2364xxx  (ref. 17). after il-6 stimulation, jak2, stat3 and  xxxg2216xxx  were hyperphosphorylated to a greater
degree in knockout mefs compared with wild-type mefs (fig. 2e). in
addition, jak2 was found to specifically interact with plcgamma1 in an  xxxg1181xxx -dependent manner (see supplementary information, fig. s1). these
results suggest that plcgamma1 is a general regulator of jak2 in the presence
of cytokines that activate jak2.
to confirm the inhibitory effects of endogenous plcgamma1 on the
phosphorylation of jak2 and  xxxg2216xxx , small interfering rna (sirna)
was used to abrogate the action of plcgamma1. transfection with plcgamma1directed sirna constructs resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of jak2
and  xxxg2216xxx  (fig. 2f). moreover, the importance of the n-terminal sh2
domain was made evident by the failure of plcgamma1r586k re-expression, in
contrast with plcgamma1r694k, to inhibit jak2 phosphorylation in knockout
mefs (fig. 2g). taken together, these results strongly indicate that the
potentiation of  xxxd3223xxx  signalling in knockout mefs is because
of a deficiency of plcgamma1, rather than to some other secondary effect.
it has been reported that leptin, ifngamma and  xxxd3223xxx  promote
the association between jak2 and ptp-1b18, and that  xxxg1893xxx  regulates
 xxxd3223xxx  signalling by reducing the extent of jak2 phosphorylation19. to examine the specificity of  xxxg1893xxx  in the phosphorylation
of jak2, we investigated whether jak2 is a direct substrate of  xxxg1893xxx .
 xxxg1893xxx  directly dephosphorylated jak2 in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 3a). in addition, the phosphorylation of jak2 and  xxxg2216xxx  were
potentiated by  xxxg1893xxx  knockdown (see supplementary information,
fig. s1b). moreover, the ectopic expression of wild-type  xxxg1893xxx  ( xxxg1893xxx ) was found to reduce jak2 phosphorylation in response to growth
hormone, but phosphatase-inactive  xxxg1893xxx  (ptp-1bcs) did not (see
supplementary information, fig. s1c). moreover,. these results demonstrate that  xxxg1893xxx  directly attenuates the activation of jak2.
because other proteins capable of binding to the sh3 domain of
plcgamma1 may regulate the  xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling pathway (fig. 2g), we investigated whether plcgamma1 physically binds  xxxg1893xxx .
gst– xxxg1893xxx  was found to directly interact with purified plcgamma1 (see
supplementary information, fig. s1d). moreover, the sh3 domain of
plcgamma1 was essential for interaction with  xxxg1893xxx  (see supplementary
information, fig. s1e). interestingly, plcgamma1 formed ternary complexes with jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx  in a  xxxd3223xxx -dependent manner (fig. 3b). in particular, the abolishment of interaction between
plcgamma1r586k and  xxxg1893xxx  was caused by the impairment of the localization of plcgamma1r586k to membrane compartments after growth-hormone
stimulation (fig. 3b, c). wild-type plcgamma1 was observed to colocalize

with  xxxg1893xxx  and jak2 in membrane compartments after growth-hormone stimulation (fig. 3c, d). however, plcgamma1r586k did not localize in
membrane compartments (fig. 3c). conversely, plcgamma1p842l, which can
be localized in the plasma membrane after growth-hormone stimulation, did not colocalize with  xxxg1893xxx  (fig. 3d). these results strongly
indicate that the sh2 and sh3 domains of plcgamma1 act differently during
 xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling.
to determine the nature of the relationships between plcgamma1, jak2
and  xxxg1893xxx , the effect of plcgamma1 on the interaction between jak2 and
 xxxg1893xxx  was examined. the re-expression of wild-type plcgamma1 in knockout mefs rescued the association between jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx , whereas
plcgamma1r586k did not (fig. 4a). consistent with previous results (figs 2g
and 3), it was interesting to note that the expression of plcgamma1p842l did
not result in an association between jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx  as  xxxg1893xxx  was
incapable of interacting with plcgamma1p842l. this suggests that the physical
interaction between jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx  occurs through the sh domains
of plcgamma1. using confocal microscopy, it was observed that the interaction between jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx  was abolished in knockout mefs
(fig. 4b). interestingly, the decrease in plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx  was found
to additively suppress  xxxd3223xxx -induced jak2 and  xxxg2216xxx  activation (fig. 4c). taken together, these results demonstrate that plcgamma1
physically links jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx , and that this leads to the dephosphorylation of jak2 and  xxxg2216xxx .
stat proteins are a well known family of transcription factors and
they are translocated to the nucleus after activation by jak2 (ref. 4). we
investigated whether plcgamma1 regulates the translocation of  xxxg2216xxx  to the
nucleus. after treating wild-type mefs with  xxxd3223xxx ,  xxxg2216xxx 
was translocated to the nucleus, and this translocation was enhanced in
knockout mefs (fig. 4d and see supplementary information, fig. s2a).
plcgamma1 totally inhibited  xxxd3223xxx -induced translocation of
 xxxg2216xxx  to the nucleus, but plcgamma1p842l, as well as plcgamma1r586k, did not
affect  xxxg2216xxx  translocation to nucleus (fig. 4e), suggesting that plcgamma1
specifically inhibits the activation and translocation of  xxxg2216xxx .
jak2 is essentially required for the upregulation of c-fos and c-myc
promoters, and cellular proliferation20. therefore, we examined the
effect of plcgamma1 on the activation of c-fos-mediated signalling. in the
absence of plcgamma1, the expression of c-fos protein was higher than in
wild-type mefs. moreover, plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx  additively suppressed
 xxxd3223xxx -induced c-fos expression, indicating that  xxxd3223xxx -induced c-fos expression is regulated by plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx  (see
supplementary information, fig. 2c, b). as c-fos is  xxxg220xxx  of ap-1,
we next examined ap-1-dependent transcription: the re-expression of
wild-type plcgamma1 failed to increase ap-1-dependent transcriptional
activity, but the enzymatic activity of plcgamma1 was not required (fig. 5a).
in addition, specific sirnas against plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx  additively augmented ap-1–luc transcriptional activity, suggesting that plcgamma1 and
 xxxg1893xxx  physiologically suppress  xxxd3223xxx -induced cellular
proliferation (fig. 5b).
to further examine the specific role of plcgamma1 in growth hormonemediated mitogenic function, we performed 5-bromouridine (brdu)
immunofluorescent staining. knockout mefs showed markedly
higher levels of brdu incorporation than wild-type mefs (fig. 5c).
the mitogenic activity was considerably reduced by the re-expression
of wild-type plcgamma1 (fig. 5f), suggesting that plcgamma1-mediated suppression of the jak2– xxxg2216xxx  activation leads to the downregulation of growth
hormone-induced transcriptional activity and cellular proliferation.

were treated with  xxxd3223xxx  or il-6 for 3 h. rt–pcr was performed with
specific primers for plcgamma1,  xxxg1893xxx , igf-1, igfbp-3, c-myc,  xxxg366xxx  and
 xxxg861xxx . (e) plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx -silenced hepg2 cells were treated with growth
hormone or il-6 for 36 h. proliferation activity in cells was measured as
described in the methods. the error bars represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3).

in addition, the cellular proliferation induced by  xxxd3223xxx  was
found to increase significantly in the absence of plcgamma1 using thymidine
incorporation assays (see supplementary information, fig. s2d).
cytokine-induced gene transcription and cellular proliferation was
analysed in plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx  knockdown hepg2 cells. it was reported that
insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) and igf binding protein-3 (igfbp-3),
which can be induced by  xxxd3223xxx  have an essential role in regulating somatic growth21. in addition, it was reported that il-6 either directly
or indirectly regulates c-myc and  xxxg366xxx  to progress through the cell
cycle22. the knockdown of plcgamma1 or  xxxg1893xxx  significantly increased growth

hormone-induced transcriptional activity (fig. 5d and see supplementary
information, fig. s3a–c). in addition, the decrease in both plcgamma1 and
 xxxg1893xxx  additively potentiated  xxxd3223xxx -induced transcriptional
activity (fig. 5d). consistent with transcriptional activity, the knockdown
of plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx  complex markedly increased the level of cellular proliferation in hepg2 cells (fig. 5e). taken together, these results strongly
suggest that the plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx  complex is an essential modulator of
 xxxd3223xxx - or il-6-induced gene expression and cellular proliferation. moreover, the physiological consequences of this complex have a novel
role in signalling attenuation, at least at the cellular level.

the main findings of this study are that plcgamma1 forms a ternary complex with jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx , and that plcgamma1 negatively regulates growth
hormone-induced jak2 phosphorylation. this negative regulation results
in the downregulation of  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation, transcriptional activation and cellular proliferation (see supplementary information, fig. s3f).
it has been reported that  xxxd3223xxx  increases plc activity and
elicits a rise in cellular dag10–12. however, there is no evidence that
plcgamma1 can regulate  xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling pathways.
here, we have demonstrate that the sh domains of plcgamma1 specifically
link jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx  in  xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling, and that
this link is indispensable for its enzymatic activity. these results demonstrate the first evidence for the physiological relationship between
plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx  complexes and  xxxd3223xxx -induced cellular proliferation, and the participation of plcgamma1 in hepatocyte proliferation.
it is well known that plcgamma1 has a central role in growth factor-mediated signal transduction through its sh domains6–9. however, it has not
been determined how  xxxd3223xxx -induced signalling is regulated
by plcgamma1. we have described dual roles for sh domains as the n-terminal sh2 domain of plcgamma1 participates in its interaction with activated
jak2, and the sh3 domain is essential for its direct interaction with  xxxg1893xxx . in addition, il-6 induced the association between plcgamma1 and jak2,
and jak2, stat3 and  xxxg2216xxx  activations were potentiated in knockout
mefs (fig. 2e and see supplementary information, fig.  xxxd3227xxx ). therefore,
we suggest that the sh2 and sh3 domains of plcgamma1 act differently and
specifically on the cytokine-mediated jak2– xxxg2216xxx  signalling pathway
(see supplementary information, fig. s3f).
the physiological role of  xxxg1893xxx  in the regulation of insulin signalling, and as a regulator of diabetes and obesity, has been studied
extensively23,24. however, its function in other physiological responses
regulated in vivo by  xxxg2198xxx  signalling, such as  xxxd3223xxx - or il-6-mediated signalling, is poorly understood. to address
this, we investigated the physiological role of plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx  complex in response to transcriptional activity and proliferation in hepatocytes. several reports indicate that  xxxd3223xxx  or il-6 induces
hepatocyte proliferation25,26. furthermore, it is clear that  xxxd3223xxx -mediated signalling is essential for postnatal growth27. our
data indicate that the absence of plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx  complex markedly
enhanced hepatocyte proliferation (fig. 5e) and this complex also
significantly regulated  xxxd3223xxx - and il-6-induced gene
expression (including igf-1, igfbp-3, c-myc and  xxxg366xxx , which
are essential for the liver regeneration; fig. 5d and see supplementary
information, fig. 3c, d). taken together, these results strongly suggest that plcgamma1– xxxg1893xxx  complex is an essential modulator of growth
hormone- or il-6-induced hepatocyte proliferation. these data are
consistent with a recent report that  xxxg1893xxx –/– mice are resistant to
liver damage and lethality, indicating that  xxxg1893xxx  may be a potential
therapeutic target against hepatotoxic agents28.
methods

hanmi pharmaceu. co., ltd (seoul, korea). il-6 was obtained from calbiochem
(la jolla, ca). anti-flag antibodies were obtained from sigma (sigma, st louis,
mo) and anti-plcgamma1, c-fos,  xxxg2216xxx , stat3, jak2,  xxxg1893xxx , ghr,  xxxd1075xxx  and lamin antibodies were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology,
inc. (santa cruz, ca). anti-phospho- xxxg2216xxx  antibody (tyr 694) and phosphorstat3 antibody (tyr 705) were purchased from cell signalling technology
(beverly, ma). anti-phospho jak2 antibody (tyr 1007/1008) was purchased

1396

germany), anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody from jackson
immuno research laboratories (west grove, pa) and anti-brdu monoclonal
antibody from dako (carpinteria, ca).
cell culture. nih3t3 or hepg2 cells were cultured in dmem medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum in a humid atmosphere of 5% co2/ 95%
o2 at 37 °c. mefs were maintained in dmem containing 10% foetal calf serum15.
cells were plated on a 100-mm tissue culture dish and were grown for 1–2 days
until they reached 70–80% confluency. cells were then placed in serum-free
dmem for 12–18 h before treatment with 250 ng ml–1  xxxd3223xxx .
plasmid constructs and mutagenesis. the mammalian expression vector for
flag-epitope tagged wild-type plcgamma1 was made by pcr. the amplified products
were inserted in-frame with the flag-epitope tag of pflag–cmv-2 (sigma). rat
plcgamma1 cdna was n-terminally tagged with flag sequence and subcloned into
pflag–cmv-2 vector (wild-type plcgamma1). the sh domain-defective mutants
(plcgamma1r586k, plcgamma1r694k and plcgamma1p842l) and lipase-inactive mutant (plcgamma1lim)
were introduced into the flag-epitope tag of pflag–cmv-2. ha- and gst-tagged
mouse  xxxg1893xxx  was generated by pcr-directed mutagenesis. jak2 and its dominant–
negative mutant were kindly provided by o. silvennoinen (university of tampere,
tampere, finland) and j. n. ihle (st. jude children’s research hospital, memphis,
tn). gfp-tagged  xxxg2216xxx  was kindly provided by c. carter-su (the university of
michigan medical school, ann arbor, mi). ghr cdna was kindly provided by f.
talamantes (university of california, santa cruz, ca). the mammalian expression
vector for flag-epitope tagged wild-type ghr was made by pcr.
in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays (jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx ). kinase activity
in anti-jak2 immunoprecipitates was assessed by an in vitro kinase assay using
autophosphorylation. wild-type and plcgamma1–/– mefs were lysed in lysis buffer a
(30 mm tris at ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm pmsf, 1 mm na3vo4, 1% nonidet
p-40 and 10% glycerol). immunoprecipitated complexes were washed twice with
lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm tris at ph 7.4, 5 mm mgcl2,
10 mm mncl2, 0.1 mm na3vo4). pellets were resuspended in 50 mul of kinase
buffer containing 5 muci gamma-32p-atp (nen life science products, inc., wellesley,
ma) and incubated at 30 °c for 10 min. beads were washed twice with 50 mul of
stop buffer (50 mm tris at ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl, 10 mm edta), and then boiled
in sds sample buffer. the solubilized proteins were resolved by sds–page, followed by autoradiography. the tyrosine phosphatase activity of purified  xxxg1893xxx 
(10 mug) for jak2 (4 mum) was determined at 30 °c in assay buffer (0.1 mm acetate,
1 mm edta at ph 5.5). the reaction was incubated for 15 min and quenched by
adding 1 m naoh. the reaction was stopped by adding sds sample buffer.
in vitro binding experiments. purified plcgamma1 from spodoptera frugiperda (sf9)
cells incubated with the 2 mug of gst– xxxg1893xxx  fusion proteins immobilized on
glutathione–agarose for 1.5 h at 4 °c29. protein complexes were pulldowned
by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer a. precipitates were
detected by immunoblotting using anti-plcgamma1 and gst antibody. to determine
which region of plcgamma1 interacts with  xxxg1893xxx , nih3t3 cells were solubilized with
lysis buffer a and cell lysates incubated with the 5 mug of gst-fusion proteins were
immobilized on glutathione–agarose beads for 1.5 h at 4 °c. the precipitates were
analysed by immunoblotting with anti- xxxg1893xxx  antibodies.
cell transfection, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays. nih3t3
cells and mefs were transfected using liposome-mediated transfection
lipofectamine (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) at a ratio of 1 mug of total plasmid
dna to 6 mul of lipofectamine in 100 mul of serum-free medium. after 4 h, the
medium was changed to dmem supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine
calf serum and after 36 h, the transfected cells were washed with pbs and treated
with lysis buffer a. immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed
as previously described9.
sirna against plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx . sirnas against plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx  were
synthesized by dharmacon research, inc. (lafayette, co). sequences of luciferase
sirna (control sirna) were: sense, 5ʹ-cuuacgcugaguacuucgadtdt-3ʹ;
antisense, 5ʹ-ucgaaguacucagcguaagdtdt-3ʹ. equal amount of sense
and antisense rna oligonucleotides were mixed and annealed according to the
manufacture protocol to form rna duplexes before transfection. sirna duplexes
were transfected into nih3t3 cells using lipofectamine.

cellular fractionation. cellular fractionation (total, cytosolic, membrane and
nuclear fractions) was performed as previously described30.
immunocytochemistry. after transfection (36 h), cells were stimulated with
 xxxd3223xxx  for the indicated times, washed three times with pbs, and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 30 min at room temperature. cells
were permeabilized with 0.5% triton x-100 for 4 min where indicated, washed
with pbs, and blocked by incubation in pbs containing 10% goat serum (sigma)
for 30 min at room temperature. to visualize ghr internalization, anti-flag
monoclonal antibodies diluted in pbs containing 1% goat serum were then
added for 1 h at room temperature. the samples were washed with pbs containing 1% goat serum and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (red) diluted 1:1000 in pbs containing 1% goat serum. cells were washed three times with pbs and covered with a
glass coverslip. to examine the colocalization of plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx , or plcgamma1
and jak2, nih3t3 cells expressing gfp-tagged plcgamma1 and rfp-tagged  xxxg1893xxx 
or jak2 were treated with  xxxd3223xxx  for the indicated times. the cells
were washed with pbs and immediately fixed. fixed cells were viewed with
a zeiss lsm 510 confocal microscope equipped with lsm 510 version 2.02
software, ar (458 and 488 nm) and 2ʹ-he ne–1 (543 and 633 nm) lasers. the
mean percentage of gfp– xxxg2216xxx  fluorescence in the cytoplasmic or nuclear
compartments for each treatment was determined by analysing egfp intensities from 15 transfected cells.
reporter gene assays and rt–pcr. pap-1–luc reporter plasmid
(stratagene, cedar creek, tx) was transfected using lipofectamine. after
36 h, the cells were stimulated with  xxxd3223xxx  (250 ng ml–1) for the
indicated times. after washing with pbs and lysis, the luciferase activity in
1 mug of lysate was assayed using a luciferase assay kit (promega, madiosn, wi)
with a luminometer (labsystems, epsom, uk). rt–pcr was performed as
previously described26,28. cdna was amplified for 30 cycles using the igf-1,
igfbp-3, c-myc,  xxxg366xxx  and  xxxg861xxx  primers shown in the supplementary
information, fig. s4.
cellular proliferation. mefs or hepg2 cells were grown to confluence and
subsequently incubated in dmem containing 0.5% foetal bovine serum for 36 h
before the addition of  xxxd3223xxx  (100 ng ml–1) or il-6 (250 unit ml–1). at
the indicated times thereafter, 3h-thymidine (0.5 muci ml–1) was added for 6 h. the
reaction was stopped by adding 5% trichloroacetic acid. proteins were measured
by the modified bradford procedure and radioactivity was expressed as counts
per mug of cellular protein. the brdu incorporation assay was performed as previously described8.

figure s3 plc- xxxg841xxx  and  xxxg1893xxx  complex attenuated gh-mediated signal
transduction. (a) nih-3t3 cells transfected with specific sirna for plcgamma1 and  xxxg1893xxx  were harvested. rt-pcr with specific plc- xxxg841xxx  and  xxxg1893xxx 
primers was performed. (b) hepg2 cells transfected with specific sirna
for plc- xxxg841xxx  and  xxxg1893xxx  were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific
antibodies against plc- xxxg841xxx ,  xxxg1893xxx  and actin. (c – d) plc- xxxg841xxx  and/or
 xxxg1893xxx -silenced hepg2 cells were treated with gh (c) or il-6 (d) for the
indicated times. rt-pcr with specific igf-1, igfbp-3, c-myc,  xxxg366xxx 

and  xxxg861xxx  primers was performed. (e) primers used for rt-pcr of total
rna. (f) proposed model for the inhibitory role of plc- xxxg841xxx  on gh-mediated
signaling pathway. after gh stimulation, the n-terminus sh2 domain
of plc- xxxg841xxx  interacts with jak2 and its sh3 domain of plc- xxxg841xxx  interacts
with  xxxg1893xxx . this linkage of jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx  by plc- xxxg841xxx  consequently
suppresses the gh-mediated signaling pathway and hence transcriptional
activity and cellular proliferation.

© 2006 nature publishing group

the mammalian expression vector for flag-epitope tagged wild type plcgamma1 was made by pcr. the amplified products were inserted in-frame with the flagepitope tag of pflag-cmv-2 (sigma, sl). rat plc- xxxg841xxx  cdna was n-terminally
tagged with flag sequence and subcloned into pflag-cmv-2 vector (plc-gamma1wt).
the sh domain-defective mutants (plc-gamma1r586k, plc-gamma1r694k and plc-gamma1p842l) and
lipase-inactive mutant (plc-gamma1lim) were introduced into the flag-epitope tag of
pflag-cmv-2. ha- and gst-tagged mouse  xxxg1893xxx  was generated by pcrdirected mutagenesis. jak2 and its dominant negative mutant were kindly provided by
dr. silvennoinen, o. (university of tampere) and dr. ihle, j. n. (st. jude children's
research hospital). gfp-tagged  xxxg2216xxx  was kindly provided by dr. carter-su, c.
(the university of michigan medical school). ghr cdna was kindly provided by
dr. talamantes, f. (university of california). the mammalian expression vector for
flag-epitope tagged wild type ghr was made by pcr.

in vitro kinase and phosphatase assay (jak2 and  xxxg1893xxx )
kinase activity in anti-jak2 immunoprecipitates was assessed by an in vitro
kinase assay using autophosphorylation. wild type and plc- xxxg841xxx -/- mefs were lysed in
lysis buffer a (30 mm tris, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1 mm na3vo4, 1% nonidet p-40 and 10% glycerol). immunoprecipitated
complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm
tris, ph 7.4, 5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm mncl2, 0.1 mm na3vo4). pellets were
resuspended in 50 µl of kinase buffer containing 5 µci [gamma-32p]atp (nen life science
products, inc., ma) and incubated at 30℃ for 10 min. beads were washed twice with
50 µl of stop buffer (50 mm tris, ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl, 10 mm edta), and then
boiled in sds sample buffer. the solubilized proteins were resolved by sds-page,

µg of gst- xxxg1893xxx  fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose for 1.5 h at
4℃29. protein complexes were pull-downed by centrifugation and washed four times
with lysis buffer a. precipitates were detected by immunoblotting using anti-plc- xxxg841xxx 
and gst antibody. for determining which region of plc- xxxg841xxx  interacts with  xxxg1893xxx ,
nih-3t3 cells were solubilized with lysis buffer a, and cell lysates incubated with
the 5 µg of gst-fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads for
1.5 h at 4℃. the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti- xxxg1893xxx 
antobody.

cell transfection, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assay
nih-3t3 cells and mefs were transfected using liposome-mediated
transfection lipofectamine (invitrogen, ca) at a ratio of 1 µg of total plasmid dna
to 6 µl of lipofectamine in 100 µl of serum free medium. after 4 hr, the medium
was changed to dmem supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum
and after 36 hr, the transfected cells were washed with pbs and treated with lysis
