abstract: in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbital, the left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) was occluded for
90 min. so that about 1/2 of the original flow was allowed to flow (partial occlusion).  xxxd329xxx  (a p,-adrenoceptor

antagonist) or propranolol (a reference drug) was injected intravenously 30 min. after partial occlusion. regional
myocardial ph was measured by a micro glass ph electrode inserted in the lad area. partial occlusion decreased
myocardial ph by 0.62 to 0.74.  xxxd329xxx  (1.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) significantly increased myocardial
ph, that had been decreased by partial occlusion, within 60 min. after the injection. restoration of myocardial [h+]
(defined as return towards a lower [ht] to the preocclusion level) (calculated from the ph data) induced by  xxxd329xxx 
and that induced by propranolol were 64.0 and 66.4% (measured 60 min. after the injection), respectively.  xxxd329xxx  or
propranolol decreased heart rate also. even in the paced heart,  xxxd329xxx  restored the myocardial [ht] that had been
increased by partial occlusion. these results suggest that  xxxd329xxx  has a favorable effect on the ischaemic myocardium
as has propranolol, and that the ph effect of  xxxd329xxx  is not primarily due to a decrease in heart rate.

it has been well documented that myocardial ph decreases
in response to occlusion of the coronary artery (abiko et
al. 1984a; watson et al. 1984; momomura et al. 1985);
myocardial acidosis occurs in the ischaemic area. it is also
known that the ischaemia-induced myocardial acidosis can
be attenuated by propranolol (abiko & sakai 1980), atenol01 (sakai & abiko 1985) or sotalol (izumi et al. 1982),
whereas it cannot be attenuated by ici 118,551 (sakai &
abiko 1985), a p,-adrenoceptor antagonist. these findings
suggest that one of the mechanisms responsible for the
ischaemia-induced myocardial acidosis is stimulation of piadrenoceptors in the myocardium. if this hypothesis is correct, other 0,-adrenoceptor antagonists would also attenuate
the ischaemia-induced myocardial acidosis.
the present study was designed to examine this hypothesis by the use of  xxxd329xxx  (hoefle et al. 1975).  xxxd329xxx 
is a p,-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, though it also
has a weak a,-adrenoceptor antagonistic action (dukes &
vaughan williams 1985; takayanagi et al. 1987). propranol01 was used in the present study as a reference drug to
 xxxd329xxx .
materials and methods
animal preparation. thirty mongrel dogs of either sex weighing
9.9 k0.4 kg (meanks.e.), were anaesthetized with sodium pento-

 xxxd285xxx  intravenously. respiration with room air was controlled
with a constant volume respirator (harvard apparatus company,
inc., millis, ma, usa.). a left thoractomy was performed between the fourth and fifth ribs, and the left ventricular wall was
exposed. a portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery
(lad) was separated free from the adjacent tissues at the level
immediately proximal to the first diagonal branch. an occluder,
consisting of a thread and a polyethylene tube, and an electromagnetic flow probe (fr-o20t, nihon kohden, tokyo, japan) were
placed around the portion of the lad. ischaemia of the myocardium was induced by occlusion of the lad with the occluder; the

lad flow was reduced so that about a half of the original flow was
allowed to flow (partial occlusion). the lad flow was measured by
a flow meter (mf 27, nihon kohden, tokyo, japan) and recorded
on a polygraph (model 146, san-ei instrument, tokyo, japan). a
micro glass ph electrode (mi-410, microelectrodes, londonderry,
nh, usa) was inserted in the area perfused by the lad at the
depth of 6-8 mm, and changes in myocardial ph were recorded
continuously on a pen recorder (ka-62h, rikadenki electronics,
tokyo, japan) via a ph meter (f-7 11, horiba company, ltd.,
kyoto, japan). the ph electrode was calibrated with standard ph
solutions (ph 6.84 and 7.38) before and after each experiment.
these procedures have been described previously (abiko & sakai
1980). epicardial electrocardiogram (ecg) was obtained from the
surface of the left ventricular wall using a wire electrode. difference
in st segment of the epicardial ecg between before and after
partial occlusion is expressed in terms of ast in figures. heart rate
was counted from the ecg (standard limb lead 11), and systolic
and diastolic blood pressures were measured in the left carotid
artery. all these parameters were recorded on a polygraph throughout the course of experiments. after a stabilization period of 60
min., partial occlusion of the lad was performed.  xxxd329xxx  or
propranolol solution was injected intravenously 30 min. after partial
occlusion, which continued for another 60 min. saline solution
instead of  xxxd329xxx  solution was injected intravenously in the
control study.
in some experiments, the heart was driven a t a rate higher than
the original rate with an electronic stimulator (paced heart). rectangular pulses, having 1 msec. duration with the voltage twofold
higher than the threshold, were applied to the right atrium.
calculation ofph changes. because the mean value of ph calculated
from a simple mathematical sum of each ph value is not a genuine
value, each value of ph measured by the ph electrode was converted
to the hydrogen ion concentration [h+] according to the following
formula.

[h+]= 10-ph
although the ph measured by a ph electrode does not directly
reflect [h+] but activity of the hydrogen ion, the ph value can be
converted to [ht] in the physiologic range of ph (masoro & siege1
1977). calculation of the mean f s.e. value and statistical analysis,
therefore, was made in terms of [h+] instead of ph values. mean

drugs.  xxxd329xxx  hydrochloride (nippon chemiphar co., tokyo,
japan) or propranolol hydrochloride (ici-pharma manufacturing
ltd., osaka, japan) was dissolved in saline solution so that final
concentration would be 2 mg/ml. the concentration of the drugs
was expressed in terms of salt.

statislical analysis. all the data are expressed as mean*s.e., and
the values were evaluated by the student’s t-test for paired observations, and by analysis of variance for unpaired observations (snedecor & cochran 1967). a p value of 0.05 or less was considered
significant.

the systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased slightly

min. after the injection. immediately after release of partial

the lad flow, myocardial ph, heart rate and systolic and

ml/min., 7.41, 163.3k7.6 beats/min. and 130.0k5.0 and
92.5 k 4.2 mmhg, respectively. pacing of the heart (heart
rate being increased from 163.3k7.6 to 193.8k8.3 beats/
min.) did not alter the lad flow, myocardial ph, and
systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly. partial
occlusion of the gad was then performed. when the lad
flow was reduced from 16.8_+ 2.0 (immediately before partial occlusion) to 9.5k2.3 ml/min. (30 min. after partial
occlusion), the myocardial ph decreased from 7.44 to 6.88,
the decrease in ph being 0.56. the st segment was elevated

after coronary occlusion, but systolic and diastolic blood
pressures were not altered.  xxxd329xxx (1 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 30 min. after partial occlusion. immediately after the  xxxd329xxx  injection, both myocardial ph
and st segment returned towards the pre-occlusion levels
without changes in lad flow and heart rate. immediately
after release of partial occlusion, the lad flow and myocardial ph returned to the pre-occlusion levels almost completely. when the cardiac pacing was stopped, heart rate
decreased to 133.3k 10.7 beats/min.

decrease in myocardial ph and elevation of st segment
induced by partial occlusion. heart rate was decreased
markedly by the injection of propranolol. the systolic and
diastolic blood pressures decreased slightly after the propranolol injection, but the decrease in systolic blood pressure was insignificant except the values 1, 2 and 3 min. after
the injection. immediately after release of partial occlusion,
the lad flow and the myocardial ph returned to their
pre-occlusion levels. heart rate that had been reduced by
propranolol, however, was not restored to the pre-occlusion
level by the release of lad in the whole course of experiments.
restoration of myocardial [ h + ] during partial occlusion of
the lad (fig. 5 ) .
to evaluate the effect of  xxxd329xxx  on myocardial ph during ischaemia, we compared the degree of restoration of
myocardial [h+] (defined as return towards a lower [h+] to
the preocclusion level) after the  xxxd329xxx  injection with
that after the saline, propranolol or  xxxd329xxx  (paced heart)
injection. first, the values of myocardial ph in figs. 1, 2, 3
and 4 were converted to the values of myocardial [h+], and
then the values of myocardial [h +i immediately before and
30 min. after lad partial occlusion were defined as 100
and 0% restoration of [hf], respectively. in fig. 5, the [hf
value after 30 min. of lad occlusion (or immediately
before the drug injection) is taken as 0% (note that there is
a change in expression of time; 0 min. in fig. 5 corresponds
to 30 min. in figs. 1 4 ) . the restoration of myocardial [h+
] induced by propranolol or  xxxd329xxx  (in both paced and
non-paced hearts) was significantly higher than that of saline. the restoration of myocardial [h'] 60 min. after the
injection of  xxxd329xxx , propranolol,  xxxd329xxx  (paced
heart), and saline was 86.572 2.23, 89.03 2.00, 75.25
11.32, and 22.62 3.65%, respectively. therefore, actual
restoration induced by  xxxd329xxx , propranolol, and  xxxd329xxx  (paced heart) was 63.95,66.41, and 52.63%, respective-

ly. there were no significant differences in the restoration
of myocardial [h +] among propranolol,  xxxd329xxx  and
 xxxd329xxx  (paced heart).

effect of  xxxd329xxx  on the non-ischaemic normal myocardial
p h (fig. 6, 6 dogs).
this experiment was undertaken to examine whether  xxxd329xxx  (1 mg/kg) influences the myocardial ph in the nonischaemic normal heart, in which the lad was not occluded.  xxxd329xxx  decreased both lad flow and blood
pressure slightly and the heart rate markedly, but it did not
change the myocardial ph.

discussion
it is known that the ischaemia-induced myocardial acidosis
is attenuated by antianginal drugs, such as nitroglycerin
(shibano & abiko 1983), nicroandil (abiko et al. 1984b),
propranolol (abiko & sakai 1980), atenolol (sakai & abio
1985) and diltiazem (ichihara & abiko 1982). the results
of the present study revealed that  xxxd329xxx , a p,-adrenoceptor antagonist, attenuated the ischaemia-induced myocardial regional acidosis. this supports the results of our
previous paper (sakai & abiko 1985), which suggests that
stimulation of the p,-adrenoceptors are responsible for myocardial acidosis induced by coronary artery occlusion and
that the p,-adrenoceptor antagonists are beneficial to the
ischaemic myocardium. the degree of the effect of bevantolo1 to attenuate the ischaemia-induced myocardial acidosis
is similar to that of propranolol, which is the most potent
drug in attenuating the ischaemia-induced myocardial aci-

dosis (abiko et al. 1984a).  xxxd329xxx  therefore is regarded
as a potent anti-ischaemic drug in terms of myocardial ph.
the experiment with paced heart indicated that the attenuating effect of  xxxd329xxx  on the ischaemic myocardial ph
is not due to a decrease in heart rate. by what mechanism
then does  xxxd329xxx  attenuate the ischaemia-induced myocardial acidosis? according to gross et al. (1979) and buck
et al. (1979),  xxxd329xxx  produces a redistribution of myocardial flow to ischaemic subendocardium, leading to a
favourable effect on the ischaemic myocardium. in fact,
 xxxd329xxx  has been demonstrated to reduce infarct size of
the ischaemic myocardium (wartier et al. 1980). if bevantolo1 actually increases the intramyocardial blood flow the
favourable effect of  xxxd329xxx  on the ischaemic myocardial
ph can be explained by improvement of blood perfusion in
the ischaemic myocardium, which may have been induced
by the pi-adrenoceptor antagonistic effect of  xxxd329xxx .
nevertheless, we did not confirm that  xxxd329xxx  increased
intramyocardial blood flow in the ischaemic area in the
present study.
 xxxd329xxx  has both pi- and a,-adrenoceptor antagonistic
effects (takayanagi et al. 1987). contribution of a,-adrenoceptor antagonistic action on the ischaemia-induced myocardial acidosis, however, may be minor because  xxxd2914xxx  does not inhibit the ischaemia-induced myocardial
acidosis (ichihara et al. 1979).
there is another possibility that the local anaesthetic
effect of  xxxd329xxx , which is slightly less potent than that
of propranolol (hastings et al. 1977), is also contributing
to the attenuating effect of  xxxd329xxx  on the ischaemiainduced myocardial acidosis. this is because lidocaine has
an action to attenuate the ischaemia-induced myocardial
acidosis (matsumura et al. 1987). nevertheless, the local
anaesthetic effect of  xxxd329xxx  at a dose of 1 mg/kg is not
likely to be signficant.
in conclusion,  xxxd329xxx  attenuated the myocardial regional acidosis induced by coronary artery occlusion by a
mechanism other than the decrease in heart rate.
