adrenal proteins bound by a reactive intermediate of  xxxd2656xxx 

received: 1 march 1996 / accepted: 5 september 1996

abstract purpose:  xxxd2656xxx  (o,p@-ddd), is the only
adrenolytic agent available for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. previous studies have shown that
 xxxd2656xxx  covalently binds to adrenal proteins following
its metabolism in adrenocortical tissue to a reactive
acyl chloride intermediate. it was the objective of this
study to compare the electrophoresis separation patterns of such adducts following activation of  xxxd2656xxx 
by various adrenocortical sources. methods: with the
use of a 125i-labeled analog of  xxxd2656xxx , 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-iodophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane, gel electrophoresis patterns were obtained for homogenates
from bovine, canine and human adrenocortical preparations as well as from a human adrenal preparation.
western immunoblotting analysis was used to test the
resulting patterns for adducts of cytochrome p-450
scc
and  xxxg779xxx . results: the electrophoresis separations were similar for all preparations, with bands at
apparent molecular weights of 49.5 and 11.5 kda being
the most pronounced. radiolabeling of the proteins of
a human adrenal cancer cell line nci h-295 was weak,
but a band at 11.5 kda was detected. western immunoblotting analyses indicated that the band at 49.5 kda
corresponded in molecular weight to that of adrenal
cytochrome p-450 , but the band at 11.5 kda did not

correspond to  xxxg779xxx . conclusions: the similarity of the results with canine and bovine adrenal
preparations to that of human material offers useful
systems for studying  xxxd2656xxx  and its analogs. this
should aid in understanding the mechanism of action of
 xxxd2656xxx  and in the design of compounds for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma.

introduction
since the first report of its clinical utility in 1960 [2],
 xxxd2656xxx  [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2, 2dichloroethane; o,p@-ddd] remains the drug of choice
in the treatment of adrenocortical cancer [15]. the
adrenocorticolytic activity of  xxxd2656xxx  in dogs is well
established [8, 13, 20] and in selective cases it has dramatically increased the survival time of patients with
adrenocortical cancer [25]. however, only about 35%
of the patients treated with  xxxd2656xxx  demonstrate any
objective signs of effectiveness [25]. moreover, especially at the large doses that may be needed to maintain
serum levels for adequate treatment [7],  xxxd2656xxx  exhibits severe side effects [7, 19]. these side effects and
the partial efficacy raise the question of the use of
 xxxd2656xxx  for adjuvant treatment following surgery [17]
and has restricted its use to inoperable or recurrent
tumors [10, 24].
thus, there is an obvious need for an improved
chemotherapeutic agent to treat adrenocortical cancer
[25]. as part of a program to develop such a drug, we
have studied the mode of action of  xxxd2656xxx  [4, 5, 16]
as a model compound to develop structure—activity
relationships for  xxxd2656xxx  analogs. it has been previously established, during incubations with adrenal
cortex homogenates from various species, that
 xxxd2656xxx  covalently binds to adrenal proteins through

538

a metabolic intermediate [5]. thus  xxxd2656xxx , like other
compounds containing a dihalogenated methyl moiety
[1], undergoes enzymatic hydroxylation at its dichloromethine carbon followed by dehydrochlorination to
form an acyl chloride derivative as the active intermediate. the previous investigation [5] employed the 125ilabeled analog of ddd, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-iodophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane, to detect protein binding.
the metabolism of the iodinated analog was found to
be similar to 14c-labeled  xxxd2656xxx . therefore, we continued to use this 125i analog of  xxxd2656xxx  in the present
study with the objective of identifying specific proteins
to which  xxxd2656xxx  binds. these proteins may be important in the mechanism of action of  xxxd2656xxx .

antibodies raised in rabbits, were kindly provided by dr. j.k.m.
menon (university of michigan). the paper was washed with 1%
tween 20 in tbs buffer three times and then incubated with a second antibody (antirabbit peroxidase) at a dilution of 1 : 14 000 for
1 h. the paper was washed with 1% tween 20 in tbs buffer again
and incubated with 2 ml of a 1 : 1 mixture of two ecl western
blotting detection reagents (rpn 2109, amersham) for 1 min. the
nitrocellulose paper was covered with saran wrap, mounted on
a sheet of paper which was marked at two corners with 1 lci of
a 32p-labeled marker and then the system was exposed to hyperfilm-ecl (amersham). the covered nitrocellulose paper was remounted on another piece of paper marked in the same position
with 35s ink and exposed to kodak ar x-ray film for 6 to 21 days
for detection of the 125i-labeled protein bands.

results and discussion
materials and methods
gel electrophoresis
the preparation of adrenocortical subcellular fractions, their use in
incubations to produce covalently bound adrenal proteins and the
isolation of these bound proteins from bovine, canine and human
adrenal preparations were as previously described [5]. for slab-gel
electrophoresis based on the method of laemmli [12], protein
samples in 1.0% sds (10 to 50 ll) were mixed with an equal volume
of buffer (0.062 m tris-hcl, ph 6.8), 1.0% sds, 0.001% bromphenol blue as tracking dye, 10% glycerol and 5% b-mecaptoethanol, and placed in boiling water for 10 min. aliquots of samples
(12 to 200 lg protein in 15 to 90 ll of the buffer) were applied to an
sds-polyacrylamide gel (15 cm]10 cm]1 mm). electrophoresis
was carried out with a constant current of 12 ma for the stacking gel
(4.5% acrylamide) and 25 ma for the separating gel (15% acrylamide) for about 3 h in a chamber containing an electrode buffer of
0.025 m tris-hcl (ph 6.8), 0.192 m glycine and 0.1% sds. prestained molecular weight standards were phosphorylase b, bovine
 xxxg124xxx , ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, soybean trypsin
inhibitor and lysozyme (bio-rad, hercules, calif.). the gel was fixed
in a 25% methanol and 10% acetic acid solution overnight. to
prevent cracking, 3% glycerol was then added to this solution and
the gel allowed to stand for 24 h. the gel, covered with a cellophane
membrane, was dried by a vacuum gel drier (model 543, bio-rad)
for 6 h at 60 °c using the gradient cycle and then exposed to kodak
ar x-ray film for 6 days. the autoradiogram was quantified using
a soft laser scanning densitometer (sl-trff, biomed instruments,
fullerton, calif.).

sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by
autoradiography of 125i-labeled proteins demonstrated
that radioactivity was associated with a few specific
proteins among the numerous proteins in the canine
adrenal cortex whole homogenate and its subcellular
fractions as well as in the mitochondria from bovine
adrenal cortex (fig. 1). as shown in table 1, the bands
of apparent molecular weight 11.5 and 49.5 kda were
the most intensely labeled proteins in the whole
homogenate from canine adrenal cortex. they represented 58% and 19%, respectively, of the total radioactivity on the gel. the radiolabeled protein bands of
mitochondria from bovine adrenal cortex had a pattern
similar to that of mitochondria from dog adrenal cortex except that an additional protein band of 34 kda
with 4% of the total radioactivity was found in bovine

immunoblotting analysis
for western immunoblotting analysis, the separated proteins were
transferred electrophoretically from the gel to nitrocellulose paper
(hybond-ecl, amersham, arlington heights, ill.) by the method of
burnette [3] using a transfer buffer of 0.159 m glycine, 0.025 m
tris-hcl, 0.01% sds and 20% methanol. the transfer was performed at 90 v for 1 h using a trans-blot cell (bio-rad). the
nitrocellulose paper was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with a solution of 1% tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk in
tris-buffered saline solution (tbs; 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.6,
0.14 mm nacl) to reduce nonspecific binding of the antibody. the
paper was then washed three times (1]15 min and then 2]5 min)
with a solution of 1% tween 20 in tbs, after which the nitrocellulose paper was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in antibody
solutions against bovine adrenal cytochrome p-450
or adscc
renodoxin at dilutions of 1 : 10 000 or 1 : 8000, respectively.

mitochondria and a 13.5 kda band was not detected in
the bovine preparation. in the cytosol from canine
adrenal cortex, the bands at 11.5 kda and 26 kda were
the major protein adducts found.
protein adducts previously reported [5] from incubations of the 125i-labeled analog of ddd with whole
homogenates of normal human adrenal cortex, adrenal
tumors or with nci h-295 human adrenal cancer cells
[6] in culture for 7 days were also available. these
proteins were separated by electrophoresis and the
autoradiogram of the gel showed a pattern similar to
that of canine adrenocortical whole homogenate
(fig. 2, table 1). however, the total radioactivity
bound to cellular proteins of nci h-295 human adrenal cancer cells was limited and only the 11.5 kda
band was evident.
based on previous reports of the effect of o,p@-ddd
on adrenal p-450
[26] and  xxxg779xxx  [14] and
scc
their molecular weight data [11, 21—23], it is possible
that the 49.5 kda and the 11.5 kda bands might have

(200 lg)

been cytochrome p-450
and  xxxg779xxx , respecscc
tively. immunoblotting assays were employed to examine these two protein bands. the bovine adrenal
p-450 antibody used in this study had crossimmunoscc
reactivity for the 49.5 kda bands of human adrenal
cortex and adrenal tumors as well as the band from
canine adrenal cortex. this is consistent with a previous report that immunohistochemical distribution of
the p-450
can be demonstrated in human normal
scc
adrenals, aldosteronoma and cushing’s adenoma using
a specific antibody against bovine adrenal p-450
scc
[18]. an autoradiograph showed that the radiolabeled
protein bands of 49.5 kda could be superimposed with
the protein bands of immunoblotting (fig. 1). therefore, the 49.5-kda protein band could be cytochrome
p-450
acylated by the reactive intermediate of the
scc
125i-analog of  xxxd2656xxx .
it has been shown [9] that  xxxd2656xxx  has an acute
inhibitory effect on acth-promoted transformations
of cholesterol to pregnenolone. also, an adrenal p-450
system has been shown to support  xxxd2656xxx  metabolism [13]. however, preliminary results from our laboratory suggest that p-450
is not involved in the
scc
metabolic activation of  xxxd2656xxx . that is, the metabolism of  xxxd2656xxx  is not inhibited by the addition
of cholesterol or by the p-450
enzyme inhibitor,
scc
 xxxd147xxx , to our adrenocortical preparations. thus, this radiolabeled protein could be a distinct p-450 with a molecular weight similar to that of
p-450 .
scc
in a similar manner to the immunoblotting of cytochrome p-450 , we found that the bovine adrenoscc
doxin antibody also has crossimmunoreactivity to
 xxxg779xxx  of canine adrenal cortex as well as human
adrenal cortex and adrenal tumor. however, the
radiolabeled protein bands of 11.5 kda could not be
superimposed on the protein bands that reacted with
the antibody. also, a much more intense immunoblotting band was detected in canine adrenal mitochondria
than any that was found in canine whole homogenates,
while the 11.5 kda radiolabeled protein was only seen
in canine adrenal cytosol or whole homogenates.

540

therefore, the 11.5 kda protein band is not an adduct
of  xxxg779xxx  but of another low molecular weight
adrenal protein or of a fragment of the 49.5 kda band.
identification of the major protein bands that reacted with the 125i-analog of  xxxd2656xxx  may aid in further
elucidation of the mechanism of action of  xxxd2656xxx .
the similarity of the patterns from canine and bovine
adrenal material to that of human adrenal material
offers useful model systems for studying  xxxd2656xxx  and
its analogs. such studies should aid in the evaluation
and design of new compounds that have potential for
treating adrenocortical carcinoma.
