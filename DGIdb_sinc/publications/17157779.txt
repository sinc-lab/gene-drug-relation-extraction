abstract: the aim of this study was to further validate our carrageenan-induced temporomandibular joint (tmj) inflammatory hyperalgesia model in rats by showing that administration of indomethacin before the initiation of inflammation would diminish the tmj hyperalgesia. using this
model, we investigated whether norepinephrine and local ␤-adrenoceptors contribute to the development of inflammatory tmj hyperalgesia. carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia was assessed by
measuring the behavioral nociceptive responses, such as rubbing the orofacial region and flinching
the head, induced by the injection of a low dose of 5-hydroxytryptamine into the tmj sensitized 1 h
before by a tmj injection of carrageenan. blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin prior
to initiation of inflammation by carrageenan significantly attenuated the tmj hyperalgesia. the
 xxxd2243xxx  depletion of norepinephrine or the blockade of ␤2 but not the blockade of the
␤1-adrenoceptor by the selective adrenoceptor antagonists ici 118.55 and atenolol, respectively,
significantly reduced carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia. in the present study, we further validated our carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia model to study the mechanisms involved in inflammatory tmj hyperalgesia and to test the analgesic effect of different types of peripheral analgesics.
we also demonstrated that norepinephrine released at the site of injury contributes to the development of the inflammatory tmj hyperalgesia by the activation of ␤2-adrenoceptors.
perspective: the findings that local sympathomimetic amines contribute to the inflammatory tmj
hyperalgesia by activating ␤2-adrenoceptors may be relevant to clinical tmj inflammatory pain states
less sensitive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

inflammatory tmj conditions can result in tmj hyperalgesia produced by peripheral sensitization of tmj nociceptors1,29,35,36,38 and by central sensitization of the
nociceptive neurons of the trigeminal brainstem sensory
nuclear complex.21,30,41 peripheral sensitization as well
as central sensitization are characterized by an increase
in the neuronal membrane excitability by inflammatory
mediators released at the site of injury1,29,43 and by neuropeptide and excitatory amino acid released at the tri929

geminal brainstem sensory nuclear complex,
respectively. some of the inflammatory mediators released
at the site of injury including pge2 are present at high
levels in the synovial fluid of patients with temporomandibular disorders.29 during hyperalgesic states, nociceptive threshold is lowered and a nonnoxious stimulus such
as jaw movement can induce pain1 as well as noxious
stimulus can induce increased pain.18 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) are frequently used to
manage inflammatory pain.19,32,44 the analgesic action
of these drugs results from the blockade of prostaglandins synthesis, thus preventing the peripheral sensitization of nociceptors.23,24 considering that many patients
are intolerant to prolonged treatment with nsaids and
that not all patients with tmj inflammatory pain respond to its effects,44 a better understanding of the neurochemicals and receptors involved in these conditions is
necessary.
it is well known that inflammatory pain has a sympathetic component31,33 that may predominate in pain
less sensitive to nsaids and that tmj receives a rich
sympathetic innervation.28,50,51 however, whether
sympathomimetic amines play a role in the development of tmj hyperalgesia remains to be investigated.
our recently described model of carrageenan-induced
hyperalgesia in the rat tmj36 may contribute to that.
in this model a low dose of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht) that induces minimal nociceptive behavior is injected into the tmj sensitized 1 h before by a tmj
injection of carrageenan. the chemical stimulation induced by the tmj injection of 5-ht is used to detect
carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia in the tmj region.
to distinguish this type of inflammatory hyperalgesia
from that detected by mechanical stimulation, the experimental model was termed carrageenan-induced
chemical hyperalgesia in the rat tmj. the aim of this
study was to further validate this model by showing
that administration of indomethacin before the initiation of inflammation would diminish the tmj hyperalgesia. using this model, we investigated whether
norepinephrine contributes to the development of inflammatory tmj hyperalgesia by activating articular
␤-adrenoceptors.

materials and methods
animals
a total of 154 male wistar rats (200-300 g) was used in
this study. the animals were housed in plastic cages with
soft bedding (5 per cage) on a 12:12 light cycle (lights on
at 6:00 am) with food and water available ad libitum.
they were maintained in a temperature-controlled room
(⫾23°c) and handled for at least 1 week prior to the
experiments. experimental protocols were approved by
the committee on animal research of the university of
campinas and conformed to iasp guidelines for the
study of the pain in animals.53

general procedures
each animal was placed in a test chamber (30 ⫻ 30 ⫻ 30
cm mirrored-wood chamber with a glass at the front
side) for a 15-min habituation period. each animal was
used in only one experiment and was sacrificed at the
end of the experiment. testing sessions took place during the light phase (between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm) in a
quiet room maintained at 23°c.39

tmj injection
animals were briefly anesthetized by inhalation of
halothane and the posteroinferior border of the zygomatic arch was palpated. the needle was inserted immediately inferior to this point and was advanced in an
anterior direction until reaching the posterolateral aspect of the condyle. tmj injections were performed via a
30-gauge needle introduced to the left tmj at the moment of the injection. a cannula consisting of a polyethylene tube was connected to the needle and also to a 50
␮l syringe (hamilton, reno, nv). volume per injection
was 15 ␮l. each animal regained consciousness approximately 30 s after discontinuing the anesthetic and was
returned to the test chamber.
after the conclusion of each experiment, animals were
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of urethane (1 g/kg) and ␣-chloralose (50 mg/kg).
the evans blue dye (0.1%, 5 mg/kg) was then administered systemically to visualize the inflammation-induced
plasma extravasation of evans blue dye bound to plasma
protein upon postmortem examination of the injected
tmjs.25 the correct site of injection was indicated by the
observation that the plasma extravasation induced by
the tmj injections was restricted to the tmj region.

measurement of behavioral nociceptive
responses
two tmj injections were given at 1-h intervals and
each rat was returned to the test chamber following the
last tmj injection for an observation period of 30 min.
rats immediately recovered from the anesthesia after
each tmj injection. the recording time was divided into
10 blocks of 3 min and a pain score was determined for
each block by measuring the number of seconds that the
animal spent rubbing the orofacial region asymmetrically with the ipsilateral fore- and hindpaw and/or flinching the head in an intermittent and reflexive way characterized by high-frequency shakes of the head as
previously described.12,36,40 rats did not have access to
food or water during the test.

carrageenan-induced chemical
hyperalgesia in the tmj
carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia was assessed
by measuring these behavioral nociceptive responses induced by application of a low dose of 5-ht (75 ␮g) into
the tmj challenged 1 h prior by carrageenan injection
(100 ␮g).36

indomethacin was dissolved in tris (0.2 m tris; ph 8.3)5
and all other drugs were dissolved in saline (0.9% nacl).
carrageenan was obtained from sigma (sp, brazil); ici
118.551 hydrochloride was obtained from tocris bioscience (ellisville, mo) and all other drugs and reagents
were obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).

experimental design
each rat was given a tmj injection of a specific combination of 2 drugs followed, 1 h later, by a tmj injection
of either 5-ht or its vehicle control (saline ⫽ 0.9% nacl).
rats were randomly assigned to separate groups of animals.
the tmj injection of 5-ht or saline 1 h after the tmj
injection of carrageenan plus saline (n ⫽ 7 and 9, respectively) or saline plus saline (n ⫽ 6 in both groups) was
used to characterize carrageenan-induced chemical tmj
inflammatory hyperalgesia.
to further validate this model of tmj inflammatory
hyperalgesia, indomethacin was injected either systemically or locally. systemic indomethacin was injected via
an intraperitonel injection performed 30 min before the
tmj injection of carrageenan plus saline followed, 1 h
later, by the tmj injection of 5-ht (n ⫽ 6). local indomethacin was co-injected with carrageenan into the tmj
and was followed, 1 h later, by the tmj injection of 5-ht
(n ⫽ 6). in another experimental group, tris was co-injected with saline into the tmj and was followed, 1 h
later, by the tmj injection of saline (n ⫽ 4). to control for
the possibility that local indomethacin could enter the
circulation after being injected into the tmj to act at a
site distant from the site of administration, indomethacin was injected into the right tmj, and carrageenan plus
saline was injected into the left tmj (contralateral),
which was also injected with 5-ht 1 h later (n ⫽ 6). furthermore, to control for the possibility that indomethacin could affect the behavioral response induced by the
tmj injection of 5-ht, systemic indomethacin was injected 30 min before the tmj injection of saline plus
saline followed, 1 h later, by the tmj injection of 5-ht (n
⫽ 7). for the same reason, in another experimental
group, local indomethacin plus saline was injected into
the tmj and was followed, 1 h later, by the tmj injection
of 5-ht (n ⫽ 6).
to test whether sympathomimetic amines such as norepinephrine play a role in carrageenan-induced chemical

tmj inflammatory hyperalgesia, we depleted the peripheral stores of norepinephrine by systemically applying
 xxxd2243xxx  (30 mg/kg, sc) for 3 days11 before the tmj
injection of carrageenan plus saline followed, 1 h later,
by the tmj injection of 5-ht (n ⫽ 7).  xxxd2243xxx  treatment was also applied before the tmj injection of saline
plus saline followed, 1 h later, by the tmj injection of
5-ht (n ⫽ 6) to control for the possibility that  xxxd2243xxx  could affect the behavior response induced by 5-ht.
to evaluate the contribution of ␤-adrenergic-receptors
to the tmj hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan, the
␤-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (0.25 or
2.25 ␮g, n ⫽ 6 in both cases) was co-applied with carrageenan into the tmj, and 1 h later, 5-ht was injected
into the ipsilateral tmj. to further evaluate the contribution of ␤-adrenergic receptors to the tmj hyperalgesia
induced by carrageenan, we next asked which subtypes
of ␤-adrenergic receptors contribute to this tmj hyperalgesia. to answer this question, the ␤1-adrenoceptor
antagonist atenolol (6 ␮g, n ⫽ 7; 18 ␮g, n ⫽ 6; 54 ␮g, n ⫽
6; or 162 ␮g, n ⫽ 6) or the ␤2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici
118.551 (0.05 or 0.1 ␮g, n ⫽ 6 in both cases) was coapplied with carrageenan into the tmj and, 1 h later,
5-ht was injected into the ipsilateral tmj. to confirm the
peripheral action of the ␤-adrenoceptor antagonists that
had any effect, the highest dose of either propranolol or
ici 118.551 (n ⫽ 6 in both cases) was injected into the
right tmj and carrageenan plus saline was injected into
the left tmj (contralateral), which was also injected with
5-ht 1 h later. to control for the possibility that these
␤-adrenoceptor antagonists could affect the behavioral
response induced by the tmj injection of 5-ht into the
tmj previously injected with saline plus saline, either
propranolol (0.25 or 2.25 ␮g, n ⫽ 6 in both cases) or ici
118.551 (n ⫽ 5) was co-applied with saline into the tmj
and was followed, 1 h later, by the tmj injection of 5-ht.

statistical analysis
the sum of the behavioral responses measured for 30
min was used for statistical analyses. data with homogeneity of variance were analyzed using the t test or oneway analysis of variance (anova) and multiple post-hoc
comparisons were performed using tukey test. a probability level of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance. data are presented in figures and
text as means ⫾ sem.

to access carrageenan-induced chemical tmj inflammatory hyperalgesia in rats, we applied a low dose of

condition, the behavioral nociceptive response measured was significantly greater (p ⬍ .05, tukey test) than
that induced by each of these drugs in saline and was
used as a quantitative measurement of carrageenan-induced chemical tmj hyperalgesia (fig 1).

indicates that prostaglandins contribute to the tmj hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan. similar results were

the injection of 5-ht into the ipsilateral tmj (fig 2b; p ⬍

discussion
in this study, we further validate our carrageenaninduced chemical tmj inflammatory hyperalgesia
model in rats36 by showing that blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin prior to initiation
of inflammation by carrageenan significantly attenuates tmj hyperalgesia. by using this model, we show
that sympathomimetic amines contribute to the development of tmj hyperalgesia, probably by acting at
␤2-adrenoceptors located in the tmj region. this is
based on the findings that depletion of intracellular
stores of norepinephrine or blockade of articular ␤2adrenoceptors prior to initiation of inflammation by

it is well known that the analgesic action of nsaids
such as indomethacin results from blockade of the synthesis of cyclooxigenase products such as prostaglandins.10,13,45 also well known is that prostaglandins are
common mediators of inflammatory processes and induce nociceptor sensitization.6,8,46 therefore, the
finding that indomethacin significantly attenuated
the hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan in the tmj
indicates that prostaglandin contributes to this articular hyperalgesic condition. this finding is consistent
with those previously demonstrated in other tissues,
such as the cutaneous16,48 and the articular tissue
(knee joint),46,47 and further validates the carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia model to study the
mechanisms involved in tmj inflammatory pain and to
test the analgesic effect of different types of peripheral analgesics. given that nsaids may also possess a
central analgesic effect by attenuating prostaglandin
production in the spinal cord,42 the effect of systemic
indomethacin might be due, at least in part, to a central effect. however, the findings that local application of idomethacin similarly attenuated carrageenaninduced tmj hyperalgesia, an effect that was not
observed when indomethacin was injected into the
contralateral tmj, confirms that prostaglandin is released at the inflamed tmj.

role of norepinephrine in carrageenaninduced tmj hyperalgesia
in addition to prostaglandins, sympathomimetic
amines such as norepinephrine are also released at the
site of inflammation,20,33 where they contribute to the
inflammatory hyperalgesia.2,27 therefore, our finding
that depletion of intracellular stores of norepinephrine by  xxxd2243xxx  significantly attenuated the tmj
hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan indicates that
norepinephrine contributes to the hyperalgesic state
in the tmj, as previously demonstrated in other tissues.14,15,16,33,46 this finding is consistent with the
dense innervation of the temporomandibular joint by
sympathetic fibers arising from cells of the superior
cervical ganglion28,50,51 from where norepinephrine
may be released. this sympathetic component of tmj
inflammatory pain may predominate in some patients
that suffer from this painful condition and may explain
why some of these patients are unresponsive to the
analgesic effect of nsaids.

mechanism of action of norepinephrine
in carrageenan-induced tmj
hyperalgesia
our data suggest that the mechanism by which norepinephrine contributes to carrageenan-induced tmj hy-

934
peralgesia is mediated by the activation of ␤2-adrenoceptors; specifically, tmj injection of the selective ␤2adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118.551 but not of the
␤1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol significantly attenuated the tmj hyperalgesia. this suggestion, which is
consistent with the finding that norepinephrine-induced
mechanical hyperalgesia is blocked by the ␤-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol,33 does not exclude the involvement of other mechanisms as well as the possibility
of other related monoamines to act on ␤2-adrenoceptors
to contribute to carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia.

temporomandibular joint inflammatory pain in rats

site of action of norepinephrine in
carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia
the contribution of norepinephrine to carrageenaninduced tmj hyperalgesia via ␤2-adrenoceptor activation probably does not result from a direct action of
this amine on the primary afferent nociceptive terminals. although no previous studies appear to have examined the presence of ␤-adrenoceptor rna or binding sites within nociceptive trigeminal neurons, the
␤-adrenoceptor rna was not detected in the dorsal
root ganglion.34 in fact, it has been suggested that, in
hyperalgesic states, the site of action of norepinephrine is not on the primary afferents but rather is presynaptic on the sympathetic postganglionic terminals.31

comparison with other types of
hyperalgesia
the inflammatory tmj hyperalgesia observed in the
present study resembles other types of inflammatory
hyperalgesia in that, like them, it is mediated by prostaglandins and sympathomimetic amines such as norepinephrine. however, whereas carrageenan-induced
chemical tmj hyperalgesia is mediated by local ␤2-adrenoceptors activation (current study), carrageenaninduced mechanical hyperalgesia in the subcutaneous
tissue is mediated by local ␤1-adrenoceptors activation.16 another difference is that carrageenan-induced chemical tmj hyperalgesia reaches its hyperalgesic peak 1 h after the carrageenan injection,36
whereas carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in the subcutaneous tissue does only 3 h after the
carrageenan injection.46 therefore, the pathophysiological characteristics of the hyperalgesic state may

differ depending on the site of the inflammation or on
the hyperalgesic stimulus.
in summary, this study further validates our carrageenan-induced tmj hyperalgesia model to study the
mechanisms involved in inflammatory tmj pain and to
test the analgesic effect of different types of peripheral
analgesics. in addition, we conclude that sympathomimetic amines such as norepinephrine are released at the
site of injury where they contribute to the inflammatory
tmj hyperalgesia by acting on ␤2-adrenoceptors. the re-

lationship between our findings and the clinical tmj inflammatory pain is not yet clear. however, the involvement of sympathomimetic amines in tmj hyperalgesia
may be relevant to clinical tmj inflammatory pain states
less sensitive to nsaids.
