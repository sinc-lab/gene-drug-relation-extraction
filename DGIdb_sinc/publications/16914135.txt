abstract
anti-pruritic effects of the antihistamine  xxxd317xxx  besilate were studied in mice.  xxxd317xxx  besilate (10 mg/kg) inhibited scratching induced
by an intradermal injection of histamine (100 nmol/site), but not serotonin (100 nmol/site).  xxxd317xxx  besilate (1–10 mg/kg, oral) dose-dependently
suppressed scratching induced by  xxxg2240xxx  (100 nmol/site) and leukotriene b4 (0.03 nmol/site). an intradermal injection of  xxxg2240xxx 
(100 nmol/site) increased the cutaneous concentration of leukotriene b4, which was not affected by  xxxd317xxx  besilate (10 mg/kg, oral). leukotriene
b4 increased ca2+ concentration in cultured neutrophils, which was suppressed by  xxxd317xxx  besilate (1–100 mum). leukotriene b4 increased ca2+
concentration in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, which was also suppressed by  xxxd317xxx  besilate (100 mum). the results suggest that the
inhibition of the actions of leukotriene b4 as well as histamine is involved in the anti-pruritic effect of  xxxd317xxx  besilate.

1. introduction
 xxxd317xxx  besilate (tau-284,  xxxd317xxx ), (+)-(s)-4-{4[(4-chlorophenyl) (2-pyridyl)methoxy]piperidino}butyric acid
monobenzenesulfonate, is a non-sedative anti-allergic drug
with antihistamine action (kato et al., 1997). it has inhibitory
effects on allergic responses, including the homologous passive
cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats (yato et al., 1997; ueno et al.,
1998), antigen-induced increase in vascular permeability in the
rat nasal mucosa and antigen-induced increase in nasal airway

philic inflammation in mice (sakai et al., 1997).  xxxd317xxx 
besilate inhibits pruritus in chronic urticaria, eczema/dermatitis,
prurigo and pruritus cutaneous in human patients (ishibashi et al.,
1997). severe pruritus in these chronic skin diseases except
chronic urticaria are generally resistant to antihistamines (blagg,
1986; ring et al., 2001; wahlgren et al., 1990). since  xxxd317xxx 
besilate relieves antihistamine-resistant pruritus, it is possible that
pharmacological action(s) other than blocking of h1 histamine
receptors are also responsible for the anti-pruritic effects of this
agent.
 xxxg2240xxx  is a potent pruritogenic peptide (hägermark et al.,
1978; thomsen et al., 2002) and is speculated to be involved in
some pruritic diseases, such as hemodialysis-associated pruritus
(kaku et al., 1990), atopic dermatitis (heyer et al., 1991) and
psoriasis (ellis et al., 1993).  xxxg2240xxx -induced itch is thought
to be at least partly mediated by histamine released from mast
cells (hägermark et al., 1978). in mice, an intradermal injection of
 xxxg2240xxx  induces scratching, an itch-associated response,
which shares some features of human itching (kuraishi et al.,
1995; andoh et al., 1998). histamine and other mast cell mediators may not play a critical role in  xxxg2240xxx -induced itching in

60

mice, because  xxxg2240xxx -induced scratching is not inhibited by
the antihistamine and is not different between mast cell-deficient
and normal mice (andoh et al., 1998; andoh and kuraishi, 2002).
recently, it has been demonstrated that ltb4 elicits itchassociated responses (andoh and kuraishi, 1998) and is involved
in  xxxg2240xxx -induced itch-associated responses in mice (andoh
et al., 2001). although no direct evidence, there are some reports
suggesting the involvement of ltb4 in pruritus of human patients.
for example, ltb4 is increased in the skin of patients with atopic
dermatitis and psoriasis (brain et al., 1984; ruzicka et al., 1986).
azelastine, an agent which inhibits ltb4 production and blocks
leukotriene action, alleviates pruritus of chronic hemodialysis
patients (kanai et al., 1995; matsui et al., 1994). in the present
study, therefore, we examined using mice whether  xxxd317xxx 
besilate could inhibit the  xxxg2240xxx -induced itch-associated
response and whether this agent would affect the ltb4 production
and the action of ltb4.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male icr mice (4–6 weeks of age) were used. they were
housed under controlled temperature (23–25 °c) and light
(lights off from 08:00 to 20:00). food and water were freely
available. the hair was clipped over the rostral part of the back
on the day before experiment. all experimental procedures were
approved by the animal care and use committee, university
of toyama, toyama, japan.
2.2. materials

2002). the pruritogen-injected region of the skin (1.7 cm in
diameter) was removed 5 min after injection. after being
weighed, the skin was immediately shred with scissors and put
into 2 ml of ice-chilled ethanol containing 10 mum indomethacin
and 10 mum  xxxd3554xxx . after being homogenized with a polytron
homogenizer, the sample was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min
at 4 °c. one milliliter of the supernatant was freeze-dried. it was
suspended in the enzyme immunoassay buffer (cayman chemical) and was assayed for ltb4 using an enzyme immunoassay
kit (cayman chemical).
2.5. measurement of intracellular ca2+ concentration
the bilateral dorsal root ganglia at the t1–l6 levels were
removed from the mice and dorsal root ganglion cells were
cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle medium (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca, usa) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum. the primary culture of mouse neutrophils was
done in rpmi-1640 (invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. these cells were washed with optimem (invitrogen), incubated with 10 mum fluo-3/am (dojindo,
kumamoto, japan) in opti-mem containing 0.05% poloxamer
(calbiochem, dermstadt, germany). after being washed with
hepes buffer (115 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 2.5 mm cacl2,
0.4 mm kh2po4, 0.4 mm na2po4, 20 mm hepes, 10 mm
glucose: ph 7.4), they were incubated in the same buffer.
intracellular ca2+ concentration was measured using a laserscanning microscope system (radiance 2100; bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa) at 515–545 nm emission with excitation at
488 nm.
since almost all neutrophils respond to ltb4, they were
stimulated once with ltb4.  xxxd317xxx  besilate was administered

 xxxg2240xxx  (peptide institute, minoh, japan), histamine (wako
pure chemical industries ltd., osaka, japan) and serotonin (sigma,
st. louis, mo, usa) were dissolved in physiological saline. ltb4
(cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi, usa) was suspended in 0.1%
ethanol or was dissolved in 1%  xxxd1896xxx  for in vivo or in
vitro experiment, respectively. these agents were injected intradermally in a volume of 50 mul into the clipped skin.  xxxd317xxx 
besilate (tanabe seiyaku co. ltd., saitama, japan) were suspended
in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose. they were administered orally
(p.o.) 1 h before the pruritogen injection.
2.3. behavioral observation
immediately after the injection of pruritogens, the animals were
individually put into one cell of an acrylic cage (26 × 18× 30 cm)
composed of four cells, to which they had been allowed to get used
for at least 1 h. behavior was videotaped for 1 h with no one
present in the observation room. the playback served for counting
scratching of the injection site with the hind paws (kuraishi et al.,
1995).
2.4. enzyme immunoassay for ltb4
the concentration of ltb4 was determined with enzyme
immunoassay, as previously described (andoh and kuraishi,

histamine (a), serotonin (b) and  xxxg2240xxx  (c) were injected intradermally at

10 min before ltb4 stimulation. since dorsal root ganglion
neurons are a heterogeneous group and only about half of the
neurons respond to ltb4 (andoh and kuraishi, 2005), they were
stimulated twice by ltb4; the neurons were thoroughly washed
with hepes buffer after the first stimulation and were left for at
least 20 min until the second stimulation.  xxxd317xxx  besilate was
administered 10 min before the first ltb4 stimulation. the data
were obtained from neurons that responded to the second
stimulation.
2.6. data processing
all data are presented as means ± s.e.m. statistical significance was analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance
followed by dunnett's multiple comparisons or student's t-test;
p b 0.05 was considered significant.
3. results
3.1. effects of  xxxd317xxx  besilate on pruritogen-induced
scratching
maximal or submaximal scratch-eliciting effects have been
observed after an intradermal injection of histamine, serotonin
and  xxxg2240xxx  at a dose of 100 nmol/site (andoh et al., 1998;
yamaguchi et al., 1999; maekawa et al., 2000). an intradermal
injection of ltb4 produces maximal scratch-eliciting effect at
an intradermal dose of 0.03 nmol/site (andoh and kuraishi,
1998). in this study, therefore, histamine, serotonin,  xxxg2240xxx ,
and ltb4 were injected at these doses as pruritogens. fig. 1

production of leukotriene b4 in the murine skin. sp (100 nmol/site) and vehicle
(sl, saline) were injected intradermally and 5 min later, the concentration of
leukotriene b4 in the treated skin was determined. bb (10 mg/kg),  xxxd3554xxx 
(zlt, 100 mg/kg) and vehicle (vh, 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) were
administered orally 1 h before sp injection. values are the means and s.e. for

pruritogens; the maximal scratching responses were observed
during the first 10-min period.
pretreatment with  xxxd317xxx  besilate (10 mg/kg, p.o.)
significantly inhibited scratching induced by histamine, but not
by serotonin (fig. 2a, b). the action of  xxxg2240xxx  was dosedependently inhibited by pretreatment with  xxxd317xxx  besilate
at p.o. doses of 1–10 mg/kg (fig. 2c). the action of ltb4 was
also dose-dependently suppressed by  xxxd317xxx  besilate at the
same doses (fig. 2d).  xxxd317xxx  besilate at the doses tested
did not affect locomotor activity (data not shown).
3.2. effect of  xxxd317xxx  besilate on  xxxg2240xxx -induced ltb4
production in the skin
an intradermal injection of  xxxg2240xxx  (100 nmol/site)
elicits scratching within a few minutes and the effect peaked
during the initial 10-min period (andoh et al., 1998). therefore,
the cutaneous concentration of ltb4 was determined 5 min
after  xxxg2240xxx  injection. intradermal  xxxg2240xxx  (100 nmol/
site) significantly increased the concentration of ltb4 as compared with that of the saline control (fig. 3). this increase was
not significantly affected by pretreatment with  xxxd317xxx 
besilate at p.o. dose of 10 mg/kg (fig. 3). in contrast, oral
pretreatment with the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3554xxx 
(100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited  xxxg2240xxx -induced ltb4
increase (fig. 3).

leukotriene b4 (d) at a dose of 0.03 nmol/site. bb and vehicle (vh) were
administered orally 1 h before pruritogen injection. values are the means and

since neutrophils express blt1 ltb4 receptor (haribabu
et al., 2000), it was first examined whether  xxxd317xxx  besilate
would inhibit ltb4 action on blt1 leukotriene receptors in
neutrophils. administration of ltb4 (3 mum) markedly increased
the concentration of intracellular ca2+ ions; the effect peaked
around 1 min after administration (fig. 4a). the peak effect of
ltb4 was significantly and concentration-dependently inhibited
by 10-min pretreatment with  xxxd317xxx  besilate at concentrations of 1–100 mum (fig. 4b).

3.4. effect of  xxxd317xxx  besilate on increase in the
intracellular ca2+ ion concentration induced by ltb4 in
dorsal root ganglion neurons
an intradermal injection of  xxxg2240xxx  acts on the epidermal
keratinocytes to produce ltb4, which may act on the intracutaneous axonal terminals of dorsal root ganglion neurons
(andoh and kuraishi, 2005; andoh et al., 2001). it is desirable to
test the effect of  xxxd317xxx  on the action of ltb4 on the
intracutaneous axonal terminals in the skin. however, it is
difficult to test the action of ltb4 on the axonal terminals in the
skin, and functional blt1 receptors are present on the dorsal root
ganglion neurons (andoh and kuraishi, 2005). therefore, in this
series of experiments, the effect of  xxxd317xxx  on the action of
ltb4 on the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons was tested.
in the above experiment,  xxxd317xxx  besilate (100 mum)
markedly suppressed the ltb4 action on the neutrophils. thus,
in this experiment,  xxxd317xxx  besilate at the same dose was
examined to suppress the ltb4 action on the dorsal root
ganglion neurons. administration of ltb4 (10 mum) markedly
increased the concentration of intracellular ca2+ ions; the effect
peaked around 30 s after administration (fig. 5a).  xxxd317xxx 
(100 mum) almost completely inhibited the increase of the ca2+
concentration after ltb4 administration;  xxxd317xxx  action on

neurons of the mouse. (a) ltb4-induced increase in the intracellular ca2+ ion
concentration. (b) inhibition by bb of ltb4-induced increase in the
intracellular ca2+ ion concentration. the fluorescence of ca2+ ions in the
primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons pretreated with fluo-3/am was
monitored with a laser-scanning microscope. dorsal root ganglion neurons were
stimulated twice with ltb4 (10 mum); they were washed after the first stimulation
and were left for at least 15 min before the second stimulation. the data were
obtained from neurons which responded to the second ltb4 stimulation. bb
(100 mum) was administered 10 min before the first stimulation. the data shows
the maximal effect to ltb4. vh, vehicle (1%  xxxd1896xxx ). ⁎p b 0.05 vs.
vh + vh. #p b 0.05 vs. vh + ltb4. values are the mean and s.e.m. for 16–33
neurons.

the peak effect of ltb4 is shown in fig. 5b. the same dosage of
 xxxd317xxx  besilate did not significantly inhibit the increase of
the ca2+ ion concentration induced by 30 mm k+ ions (n = 38,
data not shown).
4. discussion

increase in the concentration of intracellular ca2+ ions in the neutrophils of the
mouse. (a) increase in the intracellular ca2+ ion concentration by ltb4.
(b) inhibition by  xxxd317xxx  besilate of ltb4-induced increase in the
intracellular ca2+ ion concentration. the fluorescence of ca2+ ions in cultured
neutrophils pretreated with fluo-3/am was monitored with a laser-scanning
microscope. neutrophils were stimulated twice with ltb4 (3 mum); they were
washed after the first stimulation and were left for at least 15 min before the
second stimulation. the data were obtained from neutrophils which responded to
the second ltb4 stimulation. open column and closed columns show the data
obtained from first stimulation with vehicle (vh) and ltb4, respectively. bb
was administered 10 min before the first stimulation. vh, vehicle (1% dimethyl
sulfoxide). ⁎p b 0.05 vs. vh + vh. #p b 0.05 vs. vh + ltb4. values are the mean
and s.e.m. for 16–27 neutrophils.

stimulation of cultured mouse neutrophils with ltb4 produced a single peak of intracellular ca2+ concentration, the timecourse of which was similar to that of intracellular ca2+ mobilization in cultured human neutrophils (rediske et al., 1992). one
important finding in the present experiments is that  xxxd317xxx 
besilate suppressed ltb4-induced increase in ca2+ ion concentration in neutrophils, which express blt1 receptors (haribabu
et al., 2000), suggesting that  xxxd317xxx  blocks the action of
ltb4 on blt1 receptors. some dorsal root ganglion neurons
express blt1, but not blt2 receptors and the stimulation of
blt1 receptor results in the increase of intracellular ca2+
concentration (andoh and kuraishi, 2005).  xxxd317xxx  besilate
markedly suppressed ltb4-induced increase in ca2+ concentration in dorsal root ganglion neurons. since  xxxd317xxx 
besilate did not significantly inhibit high k+-induced increase in
the ca2+ concentration, the inhibition of ltb4 effect may be due

t. andoh, y. kuraishi / european journal of pharmacology 547 (2006) 59–64

to its specific action on blt1 leukotriene receptors. taken
together, the present results raise the possibility that some of the
anti-allergic effects of  xxxd317xxx  besilate are due to the
inhibition of ltb4 action.
the second and more important findings are that  xxxd317xxx 
besilate suppressed  xxxg2240xxx -induced scratching and more
effectively ltb4-induced scratching.  xxxg2240xxx -induced
scratching is not inhibited by the  xxxg1078xxx 
antagonist chlorpheniramine and deficiency in mast cells
(andoh et al., 1998; andoh and kuraishi, 2002).  xxxd317xxx 
besilate is a non-sedative agent (kato et al., 1997) and it did not
affect serotonin-induced scratching and locomotor activity.
therefore, the inhibition of scratching induced by  xxxg2240xxx 
and ltb4 is not due to the inhibition of h1 histamine receptors in
the central nervous system and the periphery. substance pinduced scratching in mice is inhibited by the nk1 tachykinin
receptor antagonist,  xxxg1759xxx  inhibitor, glucocorticoid,
 xxxg147xxx  inhibitor ( xxxd3554xxx ), and blt1 receptor antagonist (andoh et al., 2001). on the other hand, it is not inhibited by
the  xxxg2240xxx  receptor antagonist, cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ep1
 xxxd1903xxx  receptor antagonist, and cysteinyl leukotriene
receptor antagonist (andoh et al., 2001). an intradermal
injection of  xxxg2240xxx  increases the cutaneous concentration
of ltb4, which is almost completely suppressed by  xxxd3554xxx 
(andoh et al., 2001; the present study). however,  xxxd317xxx 
besilate did not inhibit  xxxg2240xxx -induced increase of ltb4.
taken together, these findings suggest that the inhibition of
ltb4 action, but not ltb4 production, is at least partly involved
in the inhibitory effect of  xxxd317xxx  besilate on substance pinduced scratching. these features are similar to those of other
antihistamine drugs, azelastine and emedastine (andoh and
kuraishi, 2000, 2002).
 xxxg2240xxx  acts on the keratinocytes to produce ltb4,
which is suppressed by the nk1 tachykinin receptor antagonist,
glucocorticoid, and  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor (andoh et al.,
2001). an intradermal injection of  xxxg2240xxx  may act on the
epidermal keratinocytes to produce ltb4. since  xxxd317xxx 
besilate did not significantly inhibit  xxxg2240xxx -induced increase of ltb4 in the skin, it may not affect the ltb4 production
in the keratinocytes.  xxxg2240xxx  induces neutrophil infiltration
(iwamoto et al., 1993) and neutrophils produce ltb4 after
stimulation with several endogenous mediators including ltb4
(rediske et al., 1992). however,  xxxg2240xxx -induced scratching peaked within 10 min after injection and almost subsided by
30–40 min. therefore, neutrophils may not be involved in the
acute production of ltb4 in the normal skin after  xxxg2240xxx 
injection. we do not rule out the possibility that neutrophils play
a role in the ltb4 production in lesional skin. however, repeated administration of  xxxd317xxx  was reported not to inhibit
scratching of mice with oxazolone-induced chronic contact
hypersensitivity (tamura et al., 2005), finding against the
involvement of ltb4 and  xxxg2240xxx  in itching of chronic
contact hypersensitivity.
in summary, the results suggest that  xxxd317xxx  besilate has
anti-ltb4 action. the inhibition of the action of ltb4 as well as
histamine may play a role in the anti-pruritic effect of  xxxd317xxx  besilate.
