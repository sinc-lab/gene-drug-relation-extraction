the thermodynamics of agonist and antagonist binding to dopamine d-2 receptors.  the ability of dopamine agonists and antagonists to compete with [3h]spiperone binding to rat striatal membrane preparations at 4, 15, 26, and 37 degrees varied markedly with temperature. dopamine and the dopamine agonist 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (adtn) were more potent at lower temperatures. the ability of the dopamine antagonists, haloperidol, cis- xxxd2137xxx , cis-n-(1-benzyl-1-methypyrrolidin-3-yl)-5-chloro-2-methoxy-9- methylaminobenzamide (ym 09151-2), raclopride, and clozapine, and of the agonists apomorphine and pergolide, to compete with [3h]spiperone binding was little altered by temperature. (+)-butaclamol was more potent at higher temperatures. in contrast, the antagonists sulpiride, metoclopramide, clebopride, sultopride, tiapride, piquindone, and zetidoline were more potent at lower temperatures. the interaction of the agonists dopamine and adtn was driven by a decrease in enthalpy, allowing an energetically unfavorable decrease in entropy. the binding of the antagonists, haloperidol, cis- xxxd2137xxx , ym 09151-2, raclopride, (+)-butaclamol, and clozapine, and also of the agonists, apomorphine and pergolide, was entropy driven. the interaction of the antagonists sulpiride, metoclopramide, clebopride,  xxxd115xxx , sultopride, tiapride, piquindone, and zetidoline differed from that of other antagonists in being enthalpy driven. the observed entropy changes correlated with the lipophilicity of the displacing drugs and not with their intrinsic activity.
