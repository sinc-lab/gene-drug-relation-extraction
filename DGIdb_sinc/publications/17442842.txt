abstract
 xxxd3118xxx , a rifamycin analog approved for the treatment of
travelers’ diarrhea, is also beneficial in the treatment of multiple
chronic gastrointestinal disorders. however, the mechanisms
contributing to the effects of  xxxd3118xxx  on chronic gastrointestinal disorders are not fully understood. in the current study,
 xxxd3118xxx  was investigated for its role in activation of the  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ), a nuclear receptor that regulates genes
involved in xenobiotic and limited endobiotic deposition and
detoxication.  xxxg1598xxx -humanized (hpxr),  xxxg1598xxx -null, and wild-type
mice were treated orally with  xxxd3118xxx , and rifampicin, a well
characterized human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand.  xxxd3118xxx  was highly concentrated in the intestinal tract compared with rifampicin.  xxxd3118xxx 
treatment resulted in significant induction of  xxxg1598xxx  target genes
in the intestine of hpxr mice, but not in wild-type and  xxxg1598xxx -null
mice. however,  xxxd3118xxx  treatment demonstrated no significant

 xxxd3118xxx  (rifax;  xxxd3118xxx ) was approved by the food and
drug administration in 2004 for the treatment of travelers’
diarrhea (laustsen and wimmett, 2005). rifax was shown
to be a general antibiotic that acts to inhibit bacterial rna
synthesis. interestingly, accumulated data revealed the potential value of rifax in the treatment of chronic gastrointestinal disorders. rifax was effective in both acute and

effect on hepatic  xxxg1598xxx  target genes in wild-type,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and
hpxr mice. consistent with the in vivo data, cell-based reporter gene assay revealed  xxxd3118xxx -mediated activation of
human  xxxg1598xxx , but not the other xenobiotic nuclear receptors
 xxxg1599xxx , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)␣, ppar␥, and  xxxg1597xxx .
pretreatment with  xxxd3118xxx  did not affect the pharmacokinetics
of the  xxxg590xxx  substrate midazolam, but it increased the cmax
and decreased tmax of 1⬘-hydroxymidazolam. collectively, the
current study identified  xxxd3118xxx  as a gut-specific human  xxxg1598xxx 
ligand, and it provided further evidence for the utility of hpxr
mice as a critical tool for the study of human  xxxg1598xxx  activators.
further human studies are suggested to assess the potential
role of  xxxd3118xxx -mediated gut  xxxg1598xxx  activation in therapeutics of
chronic gastrointestinal disorders.

chronic hepatic encephalopathy (loguercio et al., 2003; mas
et al., 2003). several recent clinical trails have recommended
the use of rifax for prevention of the main complications in
patients with diverticular disease (latella et al., 2003; pistoia et al., 2004; papi et al., 2005). in patients with gasrelated symptoms, the colonic production of h2 is increased,
and rifax significantly reduces this production and the excessive number of flatus episodes (di stefano et al., 2000). a
combination of rifax and ciprofloxacin was effective in patients with active chronic, treatment-resistant pouchitis
(gionchetti et al., 1999; abdelrazeq et al., 2005). in addition,
rifax was beneficial in ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease

reintroduced into the  xxxg1598xxx -null background (ma et al., 2007).
the present study identified rifax as a human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand,
and it provides further evidence for the utility of hpxr mice
as a critical tool for human  xxxg1598xxx  study.

materials and methods
chemicals. rif, rifax, and midazolam (mdz) were obtained
from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). 1⬘-hydroxymidazolam (1⬘-ohmdz) was purchased from bd gentest (woburn, ma). all other
chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.
animals and treatments. hpxr,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and wild-type (wt)
mice were maintained under a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle
with water and chow provided ad libitum.  xxxg1598xxx -null and hpxr mice
were described previously (staudinger et al., 2001; ma et al., 2007).
to investigate the potential role of rifax in  xxxg1598xxx  activation, 2- to
4-month-old male hpxr,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and wt mice were treated orally
with 25 mg/kg/day rifax for 3 days. rif, a specific human  xxxg1598xxx 
ligand, was used as positive control at 25 mg/kg/day (p.o.) for 3 days.
corn oil was used as vehicle for both rif and rifax treatment. all
mice were killed by co2 asphyxiation 24 h after the last dose. liver
and small intestine were collected and frozen at ⫺80°c for further
analysis. handling was in accordance with animal study protocols
approved by the national cancer institute animal care and use
committee.
rifax pharmacokinetics and its distribution in intestinal
tract. for pharmacokinetic analysis, wt,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and hpxr mice
were treated with 10 mg/kg rif or rifax by oral gavage. corn oil
was used as vehicle for both rif and rifax treatment. blood samples were collected from suborbital veins using heparinized tubes at
predose and 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h after the administration. to compare the metabolic profiles of rifax and rif, 10
mg/kg rifax and rif were administered by i.v. and i.p. for i.p.
injections, corn oil was used as vehicle for both rif and rifax, and
blood samples were collected from suborbital veins at predose and
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h after the administration. for i.v.
injections, 30%  xxxd2982xxx  (wt 400) was used as vehicle for
both rif and rifax, and blood samples were collected from suborbital veins at predose and 0.0833, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h
after the administration. serum was separated by centrifugation at
8000g for 10 min. fifty microliters of serum was mixed with 150 ␮l
of methanol, vortexed twice for 20 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm
for 10 min at 4°c. the upper organic layer was then transferred to an
autosampler vial for rif or rifax detection by lc-ms/ms using an
api2000 sciex triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (applied biosystems/mds sciex, foster city, ca). pharmacokinetic parameters of rif and rifax were estimated from the serum concentration-time data by a noncompartmental approach using
winnonlin (pharsight, mountain view, ca). the maximum concentration in serum (cmax) was obtained from the original data. the
area under the serum concentration-time curve (auc)0 – 48 h was
calculated by the trapezoidal rule. to detect the distribution in
intestinal tract, mice were treated with 10 mg/kg rifax or rif (p.o.).
at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h after administration, the mice were
killed, and the contents in different segments of the intestinal tract
were collected. intestinal contents were weighted and homogenized
in 100 mg/ml methanol. the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000
rpm for 10 min at 4°c. the upper organic layer was then transferred
to an autosampler vial for rif or rifax detection by lc-ms/ms.
analysis of rifax and rif by lc-ms/ms. rifax and rif were
determined by lc-ms/ms, carried out using a high-performance
liquid chromatography system consisting of a perkinelmer series
200 quaternary pump, vacuum degasser, and autosampler with a
100-␮l loop interfaced to lc-ms/ms as noted above. rifax and rif
were separated on a luna c18 (50 ⫻ 4.6 mm i.d.) column (phenomenex, torrance, ca). the flow rate through the column at ambient
temperature was 0.25 ml/min with 85% methanol and 15% h2o

to as inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds). despite the differences in dose and duration, rifax was beneficial in active
ulcerative colitis, mild-to-moderate cd as well as prevention
of postoperative recurrence of cd (shafran and johnson,
2005; gionchetti et al., 2006; guslandi et al., 2006). the
mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of rifax in
chronic gastrointestinal disorders are not fully understood.
recently, it was revealed that the susceptibility to ibd was
strongly associated with genetic variation in the pregnane x
receptor gene ( xxxg1598xxx ;  xxxg1598xxx ), a member of the nuclear receptor family (langmann et al., 2004; dring et al., 2006). in a
 xxxd1860xxx  (dss)-induced ibd mouse model,
pregnenolone 16␣-carbonitrile (pcn), a rodent-specific  xxxg1598xxx 
ligand, demonstrated a protective role in dss-induced colitis
(shah et al., 2007).
in the current study, rifax was investigated for its role in
activation of the  xxxg1598xxx .  xxxg1598xxx  is an integral component of the
body’s defense mechanism involved in endogenous and xenobiotic detoxication (kliewer et al., 2002).  xxxg1598xxx  is activated by
a broad spectrum of xenobiotics, including prescription
drugs, herbal supplements, pesticides, endocrine disrupters,
and other environmental contaminants (carnahan and redinbo, 2005).  xxxg1598xxx  activation regulates a number of genes
involved in the metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics, including toxic chemicals (kliewer, 2003; rosenfeld et al., 2003;
sonoda et al., 2005). several independent observations have
led to the hypothesis of rifax as a potential human gut  xxxg1598xxx 
ligand: 1) the high degree of structural similarity between
rifax and rifampicin (rif) (fig. 1, a and b), a well known
human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand (bertilsson et al., 1998); 2) the high
expression of  xxxg1598xxx  in human gut (miki et al., 2005) and the
high rifax concentration in gut following oral treatment
(jiang et al., 2000); and 3) the induction cyp3a4, a bona fide
 xxxg1598xxx  target gene, following rifax incubation in a human
hepatocyte model (http://www salix.com/). to test this hypothesis, a novel animal model was used,  xxxg1598xxx -humanized
(hpxr) mice, in which the entire human  xxxg1598xxx  gene was

cells were plated on 24-well plates (5 ⫻ 104 cells/well, cultured in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum), and transfected with the various expression vectors using
fugene transfection reagent (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in).
the mouse ppar and car vectors were described in previous reports (kliewer et al., 1992; swales et al., 2005). the mouse fxr
vector was provided by dr. christopher j. sinal (dalhousie university, halifax, ns, canada). after 24 h post-transfection, the cells
were incubated with vehicle (dmso) and 10 ␮m rifax for 24 h. we
used 250 nm 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene, 10 ␮m wy14,643, 10 ␮m rosiglitazone, and 25 ␮m gw4064 as positive controls
for mouse car, ppar␣, ppar␥, and fxr, respectively. a standard
dual luciferase assay was used and normalized to a cotransfected
control reporter (promega, madison, wi). each in vitro assay was
repeated at least three times.

results
metabolic profiles and intestinal tract distribution
of rifax in mice. lc-ms/ms was used to develop assays to
study the pharmacokinetics of rif and rifax. the retention
time was 2.21 min for rif, m/z 823.5/791.5 (fig. 1c, peak 1),
and 3.03 min for rifax, m/z 786.3/754.5 (fig. 1c, peak 2).
the detection limit was 0.023 pmol for rif and 0.012 pmol
for rifax. after a single oral dose of rif or rifax, mouse
blood samples and intestinal contents were collected at different time points up to 48 h after treatment. in the pharmacokinetic study, the cmax of serum rifax was 0.04 ␮m,
⬃70-fold lower than that of 2.75 ␮m rif. the auc0 – 48 h of
serum rifax was ⬃300-fold lower than that of rif (fig. 2a).
however, for intestinal tract distribution, the rifax concentration was significantly higher than that of rif. in the
small intestine, the rif concentration was below 20 ␮g/g at
all time points measured (fig. 2b). for rifax, the concentration was ⬃160 ␮g/g, and it lasted up to 9 h after administration. the rifax intestinal tract distribution in the cecum (fig. 2c) and colon (fig. 2d) was similar to that of the
small intestine. no significant difference in rifax metabolism was found among wt,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and hpxr mice after
oral treatment. the cmax values of rifax (p.o. treatment) in
wt,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and hpxr mice are shown in fig. 2e. rifax is
well known as nonabsorbable rifamycin by oral treatment.
by i.p. injection, rifax was not well absorbed, and the bioavailability was significant lower than that of rif (fig. 2, f
and g). differences in metabolic profiles between rifax and
rif were observed after i.v. treatment as ultrashort t1/2 and
low auc for rifax compared with rif (fig. 2h).
 xxxg1598xxx  activation by rifax.  xxxg1598xxx  was detected in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon, but not in stomach of
wt and hpxr mice (ma et al., 2007). due to the high distribution of rifax in the intestinal tract and expression of  xxxg1598xxx 
in the gut, the effect of rifax on gut  xxxg1598xxx  target genes was
investigated by qpcr. in the small intestine of hpxr mice
treated with rifax, cyp3a11,  xxxg983xxx ,  xxxg15xxx , and  xxxg2164xxx 
were all up-regulated (fig. 3a). intestinal cyp3a11 was
increased ⬃4-fold compared with vehicle-treated hpxr mice,
whereas expression was inhibited in wt mice, and no significant change was observed in  xxxg1598xxx -null mice (fig. 3, b and c).
intestinal  xxxg983xxx  mrna was up-regulated in all three
mouse strains after rifax treatment, with 87, 74, and 172%
increases noted in wt,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and hpxr mice, suggesting

containing 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx . the mass spectrometer was operated in
the turbo ion spray mode with positive ion detection. the turbo ion
spray temperature was maintained at 300°c, and a voltage of 4.8 kv
was applied to the sprayer needle. n2 was used as the turbo ion spray
and nebulizing gas. detection and quantification were performed
using the multiple reactions monitoring mode, with m/z 786.3/754.5
for rifax and m/z 823.5/791.5 for rif.
pharmacokinetic analysis of mdz in hpxr mice pretreated with rifax. hpxr mice were pretreated with or without
10 mg/kg rifax once daily for 3 days. corn oil was used as the
vehicle for rifax treatment. twenty-four hours after the last dose of
rifax, mice were administered 2.5 mg/kg mdz by oral gavage. blood
samples were collected from suborbital veins using heparinized
tubes at predose and 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 min after administration of mdz. serum was separated by centrifugation at 8000g for 10
min. for mdz and 1⬘-oh-mdz extraction, 50 ␮l of serum was mixed
with 150 ␮l of phosphate-buffered saline, 200 ␮l of ethyl acetate, and
200 ␮l of methyl t-butyl ether. the mixture was centrifuged at 3000
rpm for 5 min at 4°c. the organic layer was then transferred to a
new tube, dried with n2, and reconstituted in 100 ␮l of 70% aqueous
methanol and 30% h2o containing 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx . mdz and 1⬘oh-mdz were detected by lc-ms/ms, as described previously (ma
et al., 2007). pharmacokinetic parameters for mdz and 1⬘-oh-mdz
were estimated from the plasma concentration-time data by a noncompartmental approach using winnonlin (pharsight). the
auc0 –90 min was calculated by the trapezoidal rule. the cmax and its
corresponding time (tmax) were obtained from the original data.
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of  xxxg1598xxx  target genes. the following  xxxg1598xxx  target genes were
analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qpcr): cytochrome p450 3a11 (cyp3a11),  xxxg1073xxx  ␣ (gsta)1,  xxxg12xxx  (mrp)2, and organic
anion transporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx )2 (guo et al., 2002; kast et
al., 2002; rosenfeld et al., 2003). rna was extracted from different
tissues using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). qpcr was
performed using cdna generated from 1 ␮g of total rna with
superscript ii reverse transcriptase kit (invitrogen). primers were
designed for qpcr using the primer express software (applied biosystems, foster city, ca); primer sequences are listed in table 1.
polymerase chain reaction reactions were carried out using sybr
green pcr master mix (superarray) in an abi prism 7900ht
sequence detection system (applied biosystems). values were
quantified using the comparative cycle threshold (ct) method, and
samples were normalized to ␤-actin.
cell-based reporter assay. a hepg2 cell line (dpx2) with
stable expression of recombinant human  xxxg1598xxx  and a  xxxg1598xxx -response
element cloned in a luciferase vector was obtained from puracyp inc.
(carlsbad, ca). the construction and validation of the cell lines were
reported previously (yueh et al., 2005). the cells were seeded according to the distributor’s instructions. rifax (1, 10, and 100 ␮m) was
added to the culturing medium, and 10 ␮m rif was used as positive
control. the activation of  xxxg1598xxx  was determined by measuring the
firefly luciferase activity 24 h later, followed by normalization of
luciferase activity by protein concentrations. for cell-based reporter

ment, whereas its expression was significantly suppressed in
wt mice, with no change observed in  xxxg1598xxx -null mice (fig. 3, b
and c).  xxxg15xxx , which was reported to be activated by rif and
pcn in human and rat hepatocytes, respectively (kast et al.,
2002), was not markedly induced by rif in liver and only
modestly induced by rif or rifax in the gut in the current
study. indeed, others found that  xxxg15xxx  is not significantly
induced by mouse  xxxg1598xxx  ligands such as pcn (maher et al.,
2005). the finding that  xxxg15xxx  is not induced by rif in the
hpxr mice suggests a possible species difference in the ciselements controlling the  xxxg15xxx  gene between humans and
mice. intestinal  xxxg2164xxx  mrna was increased 3.4-fold in
hpxr mice after rifax treatment, but no significant induction of this mrna was noted in both wt and  xxxg1598xxx -null mice
(fig. 3, b and c). as expected, rif also induced the four
mrnas in intestine but the extent of induction was less than
that observed with rifax (fig. 3d). in contrast, rif produced a significant induction of cyp3a11,  xxxg983xxx , and
 xxxg2164xxx  in liver, whereas only  xxxg983xxx  mrna was increased
in the liver of rifax-treated hpxr mice (fig. 3, e and f).
these data indicate that rifax is a gut-specific human  xxxg1598xxx 
ligand.
human  xxxg1598xxx  activation by rifax in a cell-based
reporter assay. a dose-dependent increase in luciferase
activity was observed in a cell-based reporter assay for hpxr
activation by rifax. incubation with 1, 10, and 100 ␮m
rifax in the hpxr reporter system produced a 2.1-, 6.7-, and
25.2-fold increase, respectively, versus dmso control (fig.
4a). rifax at 100 nm had no significant effect on hpxr,
whereas 10 ␮m rifax produced no significant change in

luciferase activity in the presence of ppar␣, ppar␥, car,
and fxr (fig. 4b).
pharmacokinetic of mdz in hpxr mice pretreated
with rifax. after a single oral administration of 2.5 mg/kg
mdz, the serum concentration-time course of mdz and 1⬘oh-mdz in hpxr mice was determined. pharmacokinetic
parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis.
there were no significant changes (p ⬎ 0.05) for the cmax,
tmax, and auc0 –90 min of mdz in hpxr mice pretreated with

had no significant effect on auc0 –90 min of 1⬘-oh-mdz, the
major metabolite of mdz. however, the cmax value of 1⬘-ohmdz was 50% higher (p ⬍ 0.05) in rifax-pretreated hpxr
mice, and the corresponding tmax was 2-fold shorter than the
control group (table 2). these results suggested that the
rifax-mediated cyp3a11 up-regulation in hpxr mice intestine contributed to extrahepatic first-pass metabolism of
mdz.

discussion
in the current study, the effect of rifax on  xxxg1598xxx  was
investigated. by using hpxr,  xxxg1598xxx -null, and wt mice, and a
cell-based human  xxxg1598xxx  reporter gene assay, rifax was identified as a gut-specific human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand. during the pharmaceutical development of rifax, cyp3a4 induction by
rifax was noted in a human hepatocyte model (http://www.
salix.com/). however, to our knowledge, there was no further
study on the mechanism of rifax-mediated cyp3a4 induction. the current study is the first report indicating rifax as

a gut-specific human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand that up-regulates  xxxg1598xxx  target genes, including  xxxg590xxx . in the dpx2 cell line with stable
recombinant human  xxxg1598xxx  expression, hpxr was significantly
activated at rifax concentrations over 1 ␮m, as indicated by
at least a 2.1-fold increased luciferase activity versus vehicle.
the ec50 for activation of hpxr by rifax in the dpx2 cell
line was estimated to be around 20 ␮m. the rifax concentration in intestine is much higher than 20 ␮m after rifax
treatments. in the current study, when mice were treated
with 10 mg/kg rifax (single dose p.o.), the rifax concentration in the intestinal tract was up to 150 ␮g/g (⬃200 ␮m)
intestinal content. in humans, after 3 days of rifax treatment (800 mg daily p.o.), the rifax concentration was approximately 8 mg/g (⬃10,000 ␮m) stool (jiang et al., 2000),
which indicated an extremely high concentration of rifax
exposure in the intestine. the effect of rifax on gut  xxxg1598xxx , but
not the liver receptor, was probably related to its poor absorption. the metabolic profiles of rifax in this study are
consistent with previous studies, as high concentrations of
rifax in intestinal tract with only minor distribution in the
blood (venturini, 1983; cellai et al., 1984); this was indepen-

dent of  xxxg1598xxx  expression in the gut, indicating that lack of
absorption is not due to  xxxg1598xxx -induced metabolism. in humans, rifax absorption is also negligible after oral administration. after a single oral dose of 400 mg of rifax, the
plasma rifax concentration was below the detection limit of
2 ng/ml. in urine, very small amounts of the unchanged
molecule were detected that were ⬍0.01% of the administered dose (descombe et al., 1994). thus, the current study
indicates that during clinical use, rifax functions as an
antibiotic and also as a  xxxg1598xxx  activator in the gut.
the identification of rifax as human  xxxg1598xxx  ligand provides
new insight into the role of rifax in pharmacology and
therapeutics.  xxxg1598xxx , a member of the nuclear receptor family
of ligand-activated transcription factors, is an integral component of the body’s defense mechanism involved in the detoxication of xenobiotics (kliewer et al., 2002).  xxxg1598xxx  activation regulates the expression of xenobiotics oxidation and
conjugation enzymes, and transporters, involved in the metabolism and elimination of potentially harmful chemicals
from the body. previous studies revealed cyp3a4 induction
by rifax in a human hepatocyte model. two clinical studies
that used mdz and an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl
estradiol and  xxxd2753xxx  (trapnell et al., 2007) demonstrated that rifax did not alter the pharmacokinetics of
these drugs, indicating that rifax had no significant effect
on intestinal or hepatic cyp3a4 (http://www.salix.com/).
however, in the current study, intestinal cyp3a11 was significantly up-regulated in hpxr mice treated with rifax. in
the pharmacokinetics study of mdz in hpxr mice pretreated
with rifax, a 20% decrease of cmax was observed that was
consistent with the cmax increase of its major metabolite
1⬘-ohmdz, and it can be explained by the first-pass effect
through intestinal  xxxg590xxx  metabolism. however, there was
no parallel decrease of mdz auc in hpxr mice pretreated
with rifax. auc is not only related to first-pass elimination
but also to other factors, such as absorption. in hpxr mice
pretreated with rifax, several intestinal genes including
transporters were up-regulated, such as the influx transporter  xxxg2164xxx , which may contribute to the increase of mdz
absorption. a bioavailability study on mdz was not performed because of its poor bioavailability and large variation
in mice (granvil et al., 2003). overall, rifax-mediated intestinal  xxxg590xxx  induction and potential drug-drug interactions
should be reassessed in future studies because of intestinal
first-pass effects (doherty and charman, 2002; granvil et al.,
2003).
the beneficial aspects of  xxxg1598xxx  activation is its role in detoxication by up-regulating the enzymes and transporters
involved in elimination of the xenobiotics, including cytochromes p450, gst,  xxxg2163xxx , and mrp (kliewer, 2003; saini
et al., 2005; wagner et al., 2005).  xxxg1598xxx  target genes are
critical components in intestinal barrier function against xenobiotics and bacteria (langmann et al., 2004). in the small
intestine of hpxr mice treated with rifax, several  xxxg1598xxx 
target genes such as cyp3a11,  xxxg983xxx ,  xxxg15xxx , and  xxxg2164xxx 
were up-regulated. the contribution of rifax-mediated  xxxg1598xxx 
activation as a mechanism for the effects of the drug on
chronic gastrointestinal disorders should be considered. clinically, rifax was found to be beneficial in the treatment of
multiple chronic gastrointestinal disorders, such as hepatic
encephalopathy, intestinal gas and gas-related symptoms,
diverticular disease, pouchitis, and ibd (scarpignato and

pelosini, 2005). the mechanisms contributing to the beneficial effects of rifax in chronic gastrointestinal disorders are
not fully understood, and they cannot be explained simply as
rifax antibiotic activity. recent studies revealed that the
susceptibility to ibd was strongly associated with the genetic
variation in the  xxxg1598xxx  gene, and several  xxxg1598xxx  genes were
dysregulated or down-regulated in both ulcerative colitis and
crohn’s disease patients (langmann et al., 2004; dring et al.,
2006). in a dss-induced ibd mouse model, pcn-mediated
 xxxg1598xxx  activation significantly prevented dss-induced colitis
(shah et al., 2007), which indicates the potential value of
 xxxg1598xxx  ligands as a therapeutic for ibd. further human studies are suggested to assess the role of rifax-mediated gut
 xxxg1598xxx  activation in therapeutics of chronic gastrointestinal
disorders.
