abstract
background: worldwide, cancer in the esophagus ranks among the 10 most common cancers.
alterations of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (e.g. raralpha, beta, gamma, and rxralpha, beta, gamma) expression is considered
to play an important role in development of squamous-cell carcinoma (scc), which is the most
common esophageal cancer. alcohol consumption and smoking, which can alter  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor levels, have been identified as key risk factors in the development of carcinoma in the
aero-digestive tract. therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate protein levels of
 xxxd3417xxx  receptors (i.e. raralpha, beta, gamma, and rxrbeta) in esophageal scc and surrounding normal
tissue of patients with untreated scc and controls.
methods: all study participants completed a questionnaire concerning smoking and alcohol
drinking habits as well as anthropometrical parameters. protein levels of raralpha, beta, gamma, and rxrbeta
were determined by western blot in normal esophageal tissue and tissue obtained from scc of
21 patients with newly diagnosed esophageal scc and normal esophageal tissue of 10 controls.
results: protein levels of rargamma were significantly lower by ~68% in scc compared to normal
surrounding tissue in patients with scc that smoked and/or consumed elevated amounts of
alcohol. furthermore, raralpha protein levels were significantly lower (~- 45%) in scc in comparison
to normal esophageal mucosa in patients with elevated alcohol intake. when comparing protein
levels of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors between normal tissue of patients with scc and controls, rargamma
protein levels were found to be significantly higher (~2.7-fold) in normal esophageal tissue of scc
patients than in esophageal tissue obtained from controls. no differences were found for raralpha, beta,
and rxrbeta protein levels between normal esophageal tissue of patients and that of controls.
conclusion: in conclusion, results of the present study suggest that alterations of  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors protein may contribute in the development of scc in esophagus and that in some
patients life style (e.g. smoking and alcohol consumption) may be a critical component in the
alteration of  xxxd3417xxx  receptor levels in esophagus.

background

materials and methods

worldwide esophageal cancer ranks among the ten most
common cancers [1] and the overall 5-year survival rate
for patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer is poor
(e.g. 3%–10%) [2]. although, there is a rising entity of
adenocarcinoma [3], the majority of carcinoma of the
esophagus are squamous-cell carcinoma (scc) [1]. multiple epidemiological studies indicate that alcohol and
tobacco may be important risk factors for the development of carcinoma in the esophagus [1,4]. in a case-control study, valsecchi et al. [5] showed that people who
smoked 40 or more years had almost 6-times the risk of
esophageal cancer development compared to non-smokers. those with a history of alcohol consumption of more
than two beers per day had 3-times the risk in comparison
to abstainers. furthermore, the combination of both habits was found to have a synergistic effect, increasing the
relative risk for developing cancer in the aero-digestive
tract up to 17.3-times over that of the non-smokers, nondrinkers [6]. however, despite intense research [7], molecular pathomechanisms involved in the development of
esophageal scc are not fully understood so far contributing to the lack of successful pharmacological therapies.

subjects and tissue specimens
the study was approved by the ethics committee of the
medical clinic of the university of cologne, germany.
informed consent was obtained from all subjects included
in the study. a total of 31 subjects, all of whom were
undergoing endoscopies for medical reasons, were
included in the study. twenty-one patients had untreated
scc of the esophagus, and ten scc-free subjects served as
controls. histopathological analysis of scc was performed by an experienced physician. tumor staging was
based on a graded rating system and varied from g1 (well
differentiated) to g3 (poorly differentiated). in controls,
the presence or absence of scc was confirmed macroscopically. all study participants completed a questionnaire concerning smoking and alcohol drinking habits as
well as anthropometrical parameters. using standard
pinch forceps, two biopsies were obtained from macroscopically normal esophageal tissue and scc of subjects
with carcinoma and from the mucosa of healthy controls.
biopsies were placed immediately in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°c until analysis.

alterations of retinoid metabolism and  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor (e.g. raralpha, beta, gamma, and rxralpha, beta, gamma)-mediated gene
transcription have been proposed to play an important
role in the pathogenesis of scc [8-10]. it is well established that rars and rxrs are ligand-dependent transcription factors with distinct expression patterns in early
and adult stages of development. therefore, down-regulation (e.g. loss or low expression of the specific nuclear
receptor) or "functional" down-regulation (e.g. lack of ligands) of both  xxxd3417xxx  receptor families could interfere with the retinoid signal transduction and, over time,
might result in enhanced cell proliferation and malignant
transformation. an association between altered expression of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors and the malignant
transformation of human cells has been demonstrated in
several studies [11-14]. furthermore, a reduced expression
of rargamma found in head and neck scc cell lines [15] seems
to depend on a sufficient  xxxd3105xxx  supplementation
[16].
since little is known about the abundance of rars and
rxrs protein in esophageal scc in humans, the major
focus of the present study was to determine protein levels
of raralpha, beta, gamma, and rxrbeta in normal, macroscopically unaffected esophageal tissue and scc of patients with
untreated scc and controls. in addition, alcohol intake
and smoking habits of patients and controls were evaluated and related to  xxxd3417xxx  receptor levels.

immunoblot analysis
total protein was isolated using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). using sds-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, 20–30 µg of total protein were separated
in a 9% polyacrylamide gel (page). protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (amersham/ pharmacia, freiburg, germany). membranes were blocked in
tris-buffered saline (tbs) with 5% non-fat milk powder
with tween 20 (tbst, 0.01% v/v tween 20), rinsed in
tbst, and probed with primary antibodies dissolved in
tbs followed by an incubation with the secondary antibody. primary antibodies against raralpha, beta, gamma, and rxrbeta
were obtained from alexis (dianova, hamburg, germany), the secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies
were purchased from boehringer (mannheim, germany).
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
using supersignal® west dura (pierce, ktm, bad godesberg, germany). blots were photographed (camera las
1000, fuji, usa) and immunoquantitation was accomplished by densitometric analysis using the software aida
(raytest, isotopenmessgeraete, straubenhardt, germany).
to achieve standardization and comparability of blots,
total protein derived from human liver was loaded on
each gel at three concentrations (50 µg, 25 µg, and 12.5
µg) and blottet with the samples. to ensure equal loading,
all blots were stained with ponceau red; haptene signals
were normalized to  xxxg53xxx  using a commercially available antibody (sigma chemical co., munich, germany).

results
subject age ranged from 38–71 years and most were of
normal weight (table 1). smoking habits did not differ
between patients and controls. however, significantly
more patients with scc reported to consume "elevated"
amounts of alcohol (more than 30 g of alcohol/d or more
4-times a week more than 1 drink) in comparison to controls (table 1). tumor grading ranged form g1 to g3 with
the majority being g2 (table 2).
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor protein levels in patients with
untreated esophageal scc
figures 1 and 2 summarize the results of protein measurements performed in biopsy specimens obtained from scc
and neighboring normal esophageal tissue of patients
with untreated esophageal scc. western blot analyses
demonstrated that raralpha, beta, gamma, and rxrbeta were present as a
major immunoreactive band representing the 55 kda
monomer in all tissue samples tested (see figure 1). protein levels of rargamma were found to be significantly lower in
specimens obtained from scc in comparison to surrounding normal tissue. specifically, rargamma protein levels
were ~47% lower in scc when compared with those of
normal, unaffected esophageal tissue (p = 0.040). in con-

 xxxd2969xxx , no significant differences were found when comparing protein levels of raralpha, rarbeta, and rxrbeta between
macroscopically normal, unaffected esophageal tissue
and scc.
to investigate whether smoking and alcohol consumption influences protein levels of esophageal  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors of patients with scc were grouped by smoking
habits (e.g. non-smoker or smoker) regardless of their
alcohol consumption. in smokers, rargamma protein levels
were found to be significantly lower (~68%, p = 0.010) in
scc in comparison to unaffected esophageal tissue in
smoking patients (n = 10). interestingly, a similar difference was not found in patients who were non-smokers (n
= 11, data not shown). similar, patients were than subgrouped by alcohol intake regardless of their smoking
habits into patients who (a) reported to consume no alcohol (= "none"), (b) who reported to be "moderate" alcohol consumers not exceeding alcohol intake more than
once a week, or (c) who stated to consume alcohol more
than 4-times a week or more than 30 g raw ethanol/ d (see
also table 2). since only 4 patients reported to be abstainers and since two patients in this group stated to have
given up heavy alcohol consumption several years ago,
this group was excluded from the statistical analysis.
results are summarized in figure 3. when comparing protein levels of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors between scc and
unaffected tissue obtained from patients who reported to
consume "elevated" amounts of alcohol (n = 9), rargamma
protein levels were again found to be significantly lower
in scc in comparison to neighboring normal tissue
(~40%, p = 0.038). furthermore, in this subgroup of
patients, in biopsies obtained from scc protein levels of
raralpha were ~55% lower in comparison to normal tissue
(p = 0.049). again, similar to non-smokers, in patients
who were moderate consumers of alcohol (n = 8), neither
protein levels of raralpha nor rargamma were found to differ
between tissue obtained from scc and normal esophageal tissue (data not shown). next, receptor protein levels
were compared between scc and normal tissue of

discussion

alterations of rargamma and raralpha protein levels in patients
with esophageal scc are depending on life style
in the present study, the hypothesis was tested that altered
protein levels of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors might be involved
in the development of esophageal scc in humans.
indeed, protein levels of rargamma were found to be significantly lower in scc relative to normal tissue in patients
who smoked and consumed alcohol. a similar difference
was found for raralpha in scc patients who reported to consume "elevated" amounts of alcohol. however, diminished levels of rargamma and raralpha were only found in these
sub-populations of patients with scc in the esophagus,
suggesting that underlying mechanism leading to the
development of scc may vary depending on life style of
patients. several groups have previously determined
mrna expression of rars and rxrs in normal esophageal tissue and scc. zhang et al. [17] and qiu et al. [18],
who measured mrna levels of rars and rxrs found a
striking reduction of the expression of rarbeta but not of
rargamma in malignant esophageal tissue in comparison to
normal tissue. furthermore, in in situ studies a reduced
mrna expression of raralpha was found in esophageal scc
compared with normal tissue [11]. however, in these

several mechanism have been proposed to explain how
alcohol ingestion may interfere with retinoid metabolism.
first, it has been shown that alcohol may act as a competitive inhibitor of oxidation of retinal to  xxxd3417xxx  in
several organs (e.g. colon and esophagus) [21-23]. secondly, liu et al. [24] reported an enhanced catabolism of
retinoids into polar metabolites in the liver of  xxxd102xxx fed
rats compared to pair-fed animals. this was found to be
inhibited in vitro and in vivo by chlormethiazol, an inhib-

due to the retrospective character of the present study it
can only be speculated whether the association of cigarette smoking and reduced protein levels of rargamma in scc
is a cause – and effect relationship or not. however, the
action of tobacco carcinogens are believed to be mediated
through covalent binding to dna, rna, or protein, forming dna, rna, and protein adducts [19]. furthermore,
results of in vitro and in vivo studies [20] suggest that
tobacco carcinogens (e.g. benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide)
might lead to dna methylation of rar genes subsequently resulting in an inhibition of the expression of
rars rather than mediating their action through direct
mutations.

itor of cytochrome p4502e1 ( xxxg589xxx ). a significant
induction of  xxxg589xxx  was found after one week of chronic
alcohol ingestion in human subjects [25]. therefore, the
induction of  xxxg589xxx  (and/or other cytochrome p450 isoforms) activity during chronic alcohol intake could add to
a reduced bioavailability of  xxxd3417xxx  subsequently
resulting in changes in the expression of rars and rxrs.
thirdly, it has been shown that levels of cellular retinoic
acid binding protein (crabp) can be reduced in esophageal carcinoma (e.g. adenocarcinoma and scc) [26]. this,
in turn, may lead to alterations of receptor expression and
turnover. however, whether these mechanisms play a role
in the present study remains to be determined.
rargamma protein levels are elevated in normal esophageal
mucosa of patients with scc
untill now, information on protein levels of  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors in normal unaffected esophageal tissue has been
limited. recently, in a study determining the role of rxr
mrna in barett's esophagus mrna levels of rxrbeta were
found to be higher in non-malignant tissue in patients
with adenoma than in healthy controls [27]. in the
present study, protein levels of rargamma were found to be significantly higher in normal esophageal tissue of patients
with esophageal scc in comparison to controls. it may be
that the differences between the results of others [27] and
the present study are due to differences of patients (e.g.
patients with scc vs. patients with barrett esophagus) or
differences of detection sensitivity (mrna expression vs.
protein).

conclusion
the results of the present study provide further evidence
that a diminished abundance of retinoid acid receptors in
esophagus is associated with the development of esophageal scc in humans. furthermore, in some patients life
style (e.g. smoking and alcohol consumption) may contribute to the alteration of  xxxd3417xxx  receptor levels in
esophagus. further studies will be required to elucidate
this interaction of alcohol consumption, smoking, and
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor signaling with the development of
scc in the esophagus.
