dihydroetorphine and  xxxd2070xxx  have almost the same binding affinities to all types (p. 6.
and k) of opioid receptors and antagonist binding sites, and have similar inhibition
activities to  xxxd1742xxx  stimulated adenylyl cyclase. however, dihydroetorphine showed
significantly smaller value of dtnb-index compared with that of  xxxd2070xxx . this

introduction
 xxxd2070xxx  (i ,2). oripavine derivative. has been known to have strong analgesic
potency with high affinity to the opioid receptor, and also to have potent narcotic
property and dependence. dihydroetorphine, an analog with saturated bridge in c-ring
of  xxxd2070xxx , has been reported to have similar analgesic activity of  xxxd2070xxx  (3). in spite
of its potent analgesic activity (in doses ~1 yg/kg), dihydroetorphine showed a lower
physical dependence liability than that of morphine in mouse (4.5) monkey (4) and
human (6,7). consequently, it has been used safely and effectively as an analgesic in
clinical practice for twelve years in china. furthermore, they also have reported that
dihydroetorphine
has possessed adequate therapeutic effectiveness
against heroin
addicts and no significant adverse effects in clinical use (8). however, the mechanism of
these interesting properties of dihydroetorphine is still unclear. as far as we know. there
is only one brief report about opioid receptor affinity of dihydroetorphine (9). and. there
is no report which make direct comparison of opioid receptor interaction of
dihydroetorphine with that of  xxxd2070xxx . in this report, to find out the reason of weak
addiction property of dihydroetorphine, we synthesized both compounds, and compared
the affinities of dihydroetorphine
to the type selective opioid receptor sites. and also to
*to whom correspondence

s.s’-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic
acid), dtnb. and  xxxd1742xxx  were purchased from dojin
(japan) and sigma (ij.s.a.), respectively.
opioid receptor binding studies
cerebella from male mongolian gerbils (65-808). forebrains from male guinea pigs
(2so-3oog), and male wistar rats (180-2208) brains except cerebella were dissected and
membrane fractions were prepared as described before (io). p3 fraction frotn human
placenta was also separated as described previously (1 i ). membranes and p3fraction
were suspended in so mm tris-hci buffer ( xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.4) and kept at -80°c until use.
the binding of -‘h-opioids to receptors was determined by a modification of the
method of pert and snyder (12). to evaluate type selective opioid receptor binding, 3hdamgo binding in gerbil cerebellar membranes (io). ‘h-dpdpe-cl binding in guinea pig
forebrain metnbranes and 3h-u-69593 binding in human placental p3 fraction (i i) were
used for p-type. b-type and k-type. respectively. 3h-naloxone and 3h- xxxd1913xxx 
bindings were also performed for opioid antagonistic binding site. the membrane
suspension or p3 fraction containing radioligand and test compounds was incubated at
25°c for 40 min. then, bound/free-separation was done by rapid filtration using cell
harvester over g-io glass filters (inotech, switzerland). the filters were washed with ice
cold  xxxd3449xxx , and were dried and counted in 4 ml scintillation cocktail using
scintillation counter (beckmann-ls65oo. u.s.a.). specific binding of each 3h-opioid was
calculated from the difference between the counts in the presence and absence of 10 pm
of levorphanol for 3h-damgo, dpdpe for 3h-dpdpe-cl, bremazocine for 3h-u-69593,
naloxone

results and discussion
l___
the affinities of dihydroetorphine and  xxxd2070xxx  to the various types of opioid
receptor and binding sites are summarized in the table as ki values. dihydroetorphine
and  xxxd2070xxx  displaced jh-damgo specific binding to gerbil ccrebellar membranes,
which was considered as the p-type receptor binding. in similar manner. the same
findings were observed toward 6- and k-type opioid receptors through displacing 3hdpdpe-cl and jh-u-69593 in guinea pig for&rain membranes and human placental p3
fraction. respectively. furthermore. specific bindings of 3h- xxxd1913xxx 
and 3hnaloxone to rat brain membranes were also displaced by dihydroetorphine and  xxxd2070xxx ,
equipotently. ki values of dihydroetorphine
and  xxxd2070xxx  were calculated from
displacement results, and summarized in the table. dihydroetorphine showed smaller ki
values in each 3h--opioid binding than that of  xxxd2070xxx . however. there is no statistical
difference between ki values of the two compounds. the ratio of ki values of

1.1 : 1.6. respectively. as reference opioid. wc also examined the affinities of morphine to
the opioid receptor (table). the ki values of morphine in 3h-damco. 3h-dpdpe-cl. 3hu-69593, 3h- xxxd1913xxx  and 3h-naloxone binding were 1.o : 2 is : 33.3 : 7.5 : i .7.
wang et al. (9) reported that dihydroetorphine had extremely high affinity to ptype receptor, using jh-naloxone binding to rat brain. resulted in the relative potency
from ki value of dihydroetorphine for ~1 : 6 : k = i95 1 : 2 : 1. however. our finding
showed dihydroetorphine has almost the same aftinities to p. 6, and k-type receptors. even
when 3h-naloxone binding in rat brain was used as p-type binding. the ki ratio of
dihydroetorphine was almost same as that of  xxxd2070xxx  in our experiments. the reason of
this big discrepancy between our results and theirs is unclear. however. in their reports.
the binding data of  xxxd2070xxx  is from another author’s report as reference(l6).
one
possible reason of this differentiation might be that they did not compare the receptor
affinity of dihydroetorphine and  xxxd2070xxx  directory in their experiment. anyhow, by
direct comparison, our findings indicate that the binding affinities of dihydroetorphine to
various types of opioid receptors and antagonist binding sites are qualitatively same as
those of  xxxd2070xxx .
sodium index (na-index) has been used to classify the agonistic and/or
antagonistic properties of opioid ligands (17). however, we previously reported that
dtnb-index is more sensitive and useful than na-index (1 x14,1 8). to evaluate the
binding properties of dihydroetorphine. the dtnb-index of dhe was examined. the
dtnb-indices of dihydroetorphine (9. i) and  xxxd2070xxx  ( 14.5) were significantly different
at p<o.o5(fig. i). opioid pure antagonist, naloxone. antagonist-agonist. butorphanol.
and full agonist, morphine, showed dtnb-indices of 1.05. 4.22 and 17.5, respectively. it
has been reported that  xxxd2070xxx  has full agonistic property against opioid receptor (17).
dihydroetorphine has also been considered as full agonist of opioid receptor from its
analgesic effect (6). however, our finding indicates that dihydroetorphine may have
antagonistic properties to the opioid receptor, because dtnb-index of dihydroetorphine
was significantly smaller than that of  xxxd2070xxx .
furthermore. there are few report which compare the dependent properties of
 xxxd2070xxx  and dihydroetorphine at the same time. qin et al.( 19) compared the dependent
properties of both compounds and also morphine in mice. and results indicated that the
extent of physical dependence of morphine, which was evaluated both the numbers of
jumping and loss of body weight after naloxone injection, was stronger than those of
 xxxd2070xxx  and dihydroetorphine
when the three compounds were administered with
equivalent analgesic doses. interestingly. in our results, morphine showed higher value of
dtnb-index than those of  xxxd2070xxx  and dihydroetorphine.
it has been reported that cyclicamp level in central nervous system plays an
important role for development of opioid dependence (20.21). the opioid which causes
more inhibition to adenylyl cyclase tends to possess higher opioid dependence
properties. in this study. we could not demonstrate any significant difference between
dihydroetorphine and  xxxd2070xxx  as both possess equipotent inhibition to the  xxxd1742xxx 
stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in rat striatal membranes (fig. 2-a). both inhibitory
effects were antagonized by naloxone (fig. 2-b).
recently, shen and crain (22) reported that oripavine derivatives, such as
dihydroetorphine,
but not another opioid alkaloids, act as antagonists on excitatory
opioid receptors in sensory neurons in culture, and increase potency and specificity of
opiate analgesics and attenuate development of tolerance/dependence.
in our results,
dihydroetorphine
and  xxxd2070xxx  showed smaller value of dtnb-index than that of

above. their findings may bc related to the unique properties of
and  xxxd2070xxx .

as mentioned

dihydroetorphine

in conclusion. dihydroetorphinr
and  xxxd2070xxx  have almost the same binding
affinities to all types of opioid receptors and antagonist binding sites. and have similar
inhibition to forskotin-stimulated adenytyl cyctase. however, dihydroetorphine showed
significantly smatter value of dtnb-index compared with that of  xxxd2070xxx . this
differentiation may explain partly the unique properties of dihydroetorphine.
further
experiment is required to elucidate the tow addiction property of dihydroetorphine.
