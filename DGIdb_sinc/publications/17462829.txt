summary
numerous studies suggest that increased central drive to the hypothalamic–pituitary
adrenal (hpa) axis occurs in patients with major depression. to determine if increased
central drive occurs throughout the 24 h, we evaluated acth secretion under  xxxd2633xxx 
blockade of cortisol production. we collected blood every 10 min for measurement of acth
and data were analyzed for acth pulsatility using the pulse detection algorithm
deconvolution. we studied 28 patients with major depression and 28 age and sex-matched
control subjects, of which 9 pairs were men and 19 pairs were women. we found a
significant group  sex interaction with number of acth pulses (p ¼ 0.04); depressed men
showed more acth pulses over 24 h than matched control men (p ¼ 0.02). there was also
a significant sex difference in auc pulses with men showing a smaller auc acth than
women. previous analyses of these data with rm-anova showed a smaller acth response in
depressed men compared to control men. these data suggest that pulsatility and mean
acth levels are examining different aspects of hpa axis function, and that the types of hpa
axis dysregulation in depression may differ between men and women.

secretion of most hormones is characterized by coordinated
bursts of secretion called pulses. these secretory bursts are
the result of episodic secretion of releasing hormones from
the hypothalamus. hypothalamic releasing hormones are
released with characteristic frequencies that may be
modulated by end organ negative feedback on the brain

areas responsible for these coordinated secretory bursts.
this has been shown for gnrh, the hormone system best
characterized with regards to pulse frequency (midgley and
jaffe, 1971; knobil, 1990; veldhuis et al., 1986). in the case
of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis, under
intact glucocorticoid feedback cortisol bursts appear with a
60–90 min frequency (iranmanesh et al., 1993; veldhuis
et al., 2001). the negative feedback effects of cortisol may
affect both the ultradian rhythm of these bursts as well as
the circadian rhythms of acth secretion (veldhuis et al.,
2001). under basal conditions, approximately 18–25 pulses
of acth or cortisol are seen over 24 h (iranmanesh et al.,
1993; young et al., 2001).
major depression is associated with increased cortisol
secretion, as demonstrated by a number of investigators
(sachar et al., 1973; halbreich et al., 1985; pfohl et al.,
1985; linkowski et al., 1985; rubin et al., 1987; young et al.,
2001). however, it is still unclear if this increased cortisol
secretion is a function of increased acth drive from the
hypothalamus or is a result of increased adrenal response to
acth. our previous 24 h study of the hpa axis in depression
demonstrated a trend to increased acth secretion over 24 h
(young et al., 2001); but it is not known if increased acth
results from more secretory episodes or greater amplitude
of these secretory bursts. to characterize the underlying
rhythms of the hpa axis and the effect of major depression
on this pulsatile secretory mode, we conducted studies of
pulsatile acth secretion under  xxxd2633xxx  blockade in 28
patients with major depression and 28 age and sex-matched
controls over 24 h. specifically, we sought to determine if
the hpa axis hyperactivity of major depression in the
absence of glucocorticoid negative feedback following the
blockade of cortisol production was reflected in changes in
acth pulse number, pulse amplitude or half-life.

2. methods

e.a. young et al.
blood sample. blood was drawn every 10 min for the next
24 h (145 samples total).  xxxd2633xxx , 750 mg, was administered every 4 h from 4 p.m. through noon the following day.
standardized meals were given  xxxd2274xxx :30 p.m., 7:30 a.m.,
11:30 a.m. and a snack at 3:30 p.m. the midnight and 4 a.m.
doses of  xxxd2633xxx  were given with milk. all samples were
drawn via syringe and placed in polypropylene tubes with
edta, then placed on ice until centrifuged and separated, a
maximum of 2 h after collection. following centrifugation,
plasma was separated and frozen on dry ice. samples were
stored at 80 1c until assay.

2.3. hormone assay
all samples were assayed for acth with the diagnostic
products corporation (los angeles, ca) immulite chemiluminescent based system. intra-assay variability for acth
was 4.8% and interassay variabilities were 7% and 8% for low
and high acth samples, respectively. minimum detection
limit for acth was 10 pg/ml and for cortisol was 1 mg/dl.
samples that were below the detection limit of acth were
set to 10 pg/ml.

2.4. pulse detection analyses
to characterize the pulses of acth, we used deconvolution
analysis (veldhuis et al., 1987), which assumes that all
secretion results from pulsatile secretory mode and that
accumulation of acth across the circadian rhythm is the
result of secretory burst frequencies that are greater than
twice the frequency of blood sampling (veldhuis et al.,
1989). deconvolution estimates both the characteristics of
the specific pulses and model fitting of secretory episodes
(see figs. 1 and 2).

2.1. subjects

2.5. statistics

we studied 56 subjects in total, 28 depressed patients and
28 age (73 years) and sex matched control subjects. all
subjects were recruited by advertising and were untreated
with medications for the current episode of depression at
the time of recruitment and were free of any other
medications. after initial telephone screening, patients
were administered the structured clinical interview for
dsm-iv and all met criteria for current major depression as
determined by the scid and a psychiatrist (e.a.y. or s.c.r.).
all subjects were physically healthy as determined by
screening blood work and physical examination. all subjects
signed an informed consent and were free to withdraw at
any time.

pulse parameters were compared by either a paired t-test
applied to patient–control matched pairs or a two-way
anova with sex included as a covariate.

2.2. procedure
the study was approved by the university of michigan health
system irb. all subjects were admitted to the general
clinical research center at 2:30 p.m. and given a snack at
this time. an intravenous catheter for blood drawing was
inserted at 3:00 p.m. and the first dose of  xxxd2633xxx  was
administered at 4:00 p.m. immediately following the first

3. results
the demographic data for the current group of patients are
shown in table 1. all patients currently met criteria for mdd;
16 of the 28 were recurrent and 16 of the 28 were
melancholic. none were psychotic. in two subjects, dysthymia preceded the onset of major depression. four patients
had a history of anxiety disorders on the scid (ptsd in two
(both females); social anxiety disorder in three (all
females); two with panic disorder (one male, one female)).
in addition, five patients had a past history of alcohol abuse
which resolved 2, 8, 10, 17 and 18 years earlier.
our previous report addressed overall mean acth secretion and found lower circadian-driven peak acth secretion
in depressed men compared to either control men or
depressed women. in contrast, depressed women showed
no difference in mean or peak 24 h acth secretion

compared to age-matched control women (young and
ribiero, 2006).
figures 1 and 2 show example graphs of the acth profiles
and deconvolution output for one depressed patient (fig. 1)
and one normal control (fig. 2). the mean data for cortisol
over the 24 h as well as each of the 12 h blocks are shown in
table 2. as can be seen,  xxxd2633xxx  blocked cortisol
production to a mean of around 2 mg/dl, confirming
adequate blockade of cortisol production. the mean 24 h
cortisol in control men was 2.470.3 (sd) and for depressed
men it was 2.370.7. the mean data for pulse parameters
for patients and controls are shown in table 3. overall, there
were no group differences between patients and controls
in pulse number. however, there was a significant groupsex interaction (f ¼ 4.5, d.f. ¼ 1/52, p ¼ 0.04). post hoc

testing showed a greater number of acth pulses in
depressed men than control men (p ¼ 0.02, paired t-test),
whereas there was no significant difference between
depressed women and control women (p ¼ 0.773). as would
be expected by changes in pulse number over 24 h, there
was also significant group  sex interaction in interpulse
interval, with control men showing a longer interval
between pulses than control women (p ¼ 0.02) and female
patients (p ¼ 0.039) but not male patients (p ¼ 0.138,
paired t). interpulse interval did not differ between
depressed women and control women (p ¼ 0.773). pulse
height did not differ between patients and controls
(f ¼ 0.22, d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.6). there was a significant sex
difference in pulse auc (f ¼ 7.36, d.f. ¼ 1/52, p ¼ 0.009),
with men showing a smaller acth auc than women.
however, no difference in auc was found between controls
and patients (f ¼ 0.9, d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.35). finally, the
calculated half-life of acth pulse did not differ between
patients and controls (f ¼ 0.02, d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.884).
while deconvolution was able to identify acth pulses, in
general the pulses did not occur until approximately 12 h
into the study, following the onset of overnight acth
secretory drive (see figs. 1 and 2 as examples). the
difficulty in characterizing pulses during the quiescent
period may be a reflection of the presence of low plasma
acth levels, which were sometimes below the detection
limit of our assay. to assure that levels of acth below
the detection level found in first 12 h did not affect our
findings with men, we examined pulse number in the last
12 h, when all samples were above the detection limit. we
found significantly increased pulses, 2273.7 (sd), in
depressed men and 16.774.3 (sd) in control men
(p ¼ 0.0074, t-test).

4. discussion
data from the mean 24 h acth in response to  xxxd2633xxx 
demonstrated a significantly smaller acth response to
 xxxd2633xxx  in depressed men (young and ribeiro, 2006).
despite this decrease in overall acth secretion, we
observed significantly more acth pulses in depressed men
than matched control men. this finding suggests that the
types of hpa axis dysregulation may differ between
depressed men and women. overall, our data showed little
in the way of sex differences in acth pulse parameters with
the exception of pulse area, where men demonstrate a
smaller area than women.
several previous studies have examined pulsatile acth or
cortisol secretion in major depression. in our previous study,
we examined only women, and found no difference in acth
pulse number or amplitude between depressed and control
women, in agreement with the findings here under
 xxxd2633xxx  (young et al., 2001). mortola et al. (1987) also
examined acth pulses in six women with major depression
and found an increase in the number of pulses, although the
sample size was small. the report by deuschle et al. (1997)
examined only men, and reported an increase in number of
pulses over a 6 h period between 6 p.m. and midnight, the
quiescent period of acth secretion. the male depressed
patients in our study showed very low plasma acth during
this period, so we were unable to detect pulses during the
period. thus, our observation of increased number of acth
pulses was during the period of circadian activation of the
hpa axis. but our report and that of deuschle et al. (1997)
agree that depressed men may show an increased number of
acth pulses. our studies were conducted under the
influences of  xxxd2633xxx , which removes glucocorticoid
negative feedback and therefore would be expected to
affect parameters of acth secretion. veldhuis et al. (2001)
directly compared acth secretion basally and following
treatment with  xxxd2633xxx  in nine subjects. their report
noted that the number of acth pulses was significantly
increased following  xxxd2633xxx  (from 25 to 34); in addition,
 xxxd2633xxx  treatment greatly enhanced the amplitude of
acth pulses, but there was no change in either the half-life
or burst duration. our study observed fewer pulses under
 xxxd2633xxx  blockade than found in their report, despite
using the same pulse detection algorithm. one difference in

sex differences in acth pulsatility
methods is that their study started at midnight and
consequently there was more secretory activity observed
in the late afternoon and evening, following the large
circadian secretory surge that occurred overnight through
noon. in our study, this period was at the initiation of our
study and showed very little activity, since this period is
before the amplification of acth, secretion by  xxxd2633xxx 
is occurring. consequently, it is likely we are missing some
pulses that occur during very low levels of acth secretion.
in conclusion, our study of acth pulsatile secretion under
 xxxd2633xxx  continues to observe no change in pulsatile
secretion in women. we did observe an increase in acth
pulse number in depressed men. however, the small number
of depressed male patients (9) suggests caution be used in
interpreting our results. nonetheless, it is in agreement with
the only other previous report of pulsatile acth secretion in
men (deuschle et al., 1997). in our case, this increase in
acth pulses was found despite an overall smaller acth
response to  xxxd2633xxx . this lends support to the idea that
mean secretion and pulsatility are evaluating different
aspects of hpa axis function.
