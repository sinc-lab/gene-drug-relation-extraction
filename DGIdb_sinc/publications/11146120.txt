abstract
increasing  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf) in the pns is a rational strategy for treating certain neurodegenerative disorders. the present
studies were undertaken to compare two compounds, a  xxxd1682xxx  analogue (cb1093) with minimal calcaemic effects, and  xxxd1714xxx , a
long-acting b 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, both of which induce ngf synthesis in vivo.  xxxd1714xxx  caused significant increases in both ngf
mrna and protein in 3t3 cells; with maxima  xxxd1891xxx  nm and at 8–12 h exposure. effects of  xxxd1714xxx  on ngf mrna were antagonized
by propranolol. mobility shift assays on whole cell extracts showed that  xxxd1714xxx  increased  xxxg1222xxx  binding in 3t3 cells prior to increasing
ngf synthesis.  xxxd1714xxx  was without effect on ngf mrna levels in l929 cells, whereas cb1093 caused significant increases in both
ngf mrna and protein levels in both 3t3 and l929 cells. stimulation was almost maximal at 24 h exposure and was sustained for at
least 72 h. the magnitude of the increase was much greater in l929 (700% increase) than in 3t3 cells (80%). binding to the  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx 
nuclear receptor (vdr), which acts as a transcription factor itself, was increased as early as 30 min after exposure to of cb1093 and
maintained up to 24 h. increased vdr binding preceded increased ngf mrna. a 150% increase in ap-1 binding was also evident. this
study demonstrates that cb1093 and  xxxd1714xxx  stimulate ngf levels in vitro and that ap-1 binding could be a commonality between the
mechanism of ngf induction of these two compounds.  2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
 xxxg1564xxx  is a neurotrophic protein required
for the development and survival of sympathetic and
sensory neurons in the periphery, and cholinergic neurons
in the cns [4,55]. recently, a realisation that ngf also
supports the maintenance of neuronal phenotype in the
adult has stimulated the possibility that increasing the
endogenous synthesis of ngf might provide clinical
advantage in degenerative diseases [49]. hence, drugs with
this property may have novel therapeutic uses.
the fos / jun heterodimer, one of the major targets of
pka and pkc activation [3,7,20], could be a regulatory

transcription factor for the expression of the ngf gene as
suggested by mocchetti and co-workers [37]. this premise
was later supported by the identification of an ap-1
consensus sequence within the exon 1 / intron 1 region of
the mouse ngf gene [18] and by the demonstration that
this element is important for the basal and induced
expression of ngf in cultured mouse fibroblasts
[13,18,27]. the b 2 -adrenoceptor agonist,  xxxd1714xxx , increases camp levels in c6 cells [37], leading to activation
of pka.  xxxd1714xxx  has been demonstrated to induce
ngf synthesis both in the cns and in cell culture systems
derived from the cns [53] and in peripheral tissues of the
rat in vivo [50]. however it is not yet established whether
the treatment of ngf-expressing cells with a pka activator, such as  xxxd1714xxx , alters ap-1 activity in a
manner correlated with the induction of ngf mrna.
a number of genes can be stimulated by elevation of

camp and share a responsive element related to that of
ap-1, tgacgtca [8]. several proteins bind to this
camp response element (cre) and the first to be identified was camp-response element binding protein
(creb). therefore it would be interesting to see whether
the induction of ngf mrna elicited by  xxxd1714xxx 
correlated not only to ap-1 activity but also to creb
activity.
the metabolically active form of  xxxd1682xxx  , 1,25(oh) 2 d 3 , has been demonstrated to act as an inducer of
ngf synthesis in cell culture systems, including glial cells,
c6 glioma cell lines and various fibroblast-like cell lines,
including l929 cells [43,52,56]. cb1093 is  xxxd1682xxx 
analogue with minimal effects on calcium — it is reported
to be 100–200 times less potent than 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 in
causing hypercalcaemia metabolism (see [48]). the hypercalcaemic effect of  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  analogues limits their use
in vivo for neurotrophic support, so that the observation
that cb1093 is a potent orally active stimulant of ngf
synthesis in vivo [48] makes it therapeutically interesting.
thus ngf synthesis can be stimulated by two distinct
classes of drug, whose mechanisms are not fully elucidated. there has been no mechanistic comparison of the
two in similar cell systems, so the present study was
designed with the following aims. (i) to compare the
concentration–response and time-course of action of the
two as inducers of ngf mrna and protein using l929
and swiss mouse 3t3 cell lines. (ii) to determine whether
the effects of  xxxd1714xxx  on ngf mrna synthesis can be
modulated by b-adrenoceptor blockade. (iii) to examine
the potential of the transcription factors induced by these
drugs to stimulate ngf expression.
the two cell lines chosen for the task of elucidating the
effects of cb1093 and  xxxd1714xxx  on ngf mrna synthesis were the l929 and swiss mouse 3t3 cell lines. both
these cell lines have been shown to synthesise and secrete
a biologically active nerve growth-promoting factor which
was not immunologically distinguishable from purified
ngf from mouse smg [1,45–47], however, the mechanisms of this phenomenon have not been investigated in
the 3t3 cell line, so a further aim of this study was to
investigate this phenomenon.

2. materials and methods

2.1. cell culture
cultured l929 (dr marc williams, department of
haematology, london hospital, whitechapel) and 3t3 (dr
harry navasaria, department of dermatology, london
hospital, whitechapel) were plated at an initial density of
1310 5 cells per cm 2 in dmem supplemented with 10%
fcs (heat-inactivated). the following day the cells were
transferred to medium containing dmem and hams f12

(ratio 3:1) supplemented with insulin (5 mg / ml), transferrin (5 mg / ml) and selenium (5 ng / ml) and grown for
24–48 h. the medium was refreshed again 24 h prior to
the addition of cb1093 or  xxxd1714xxx . for ngf mrna
studies the cells were harvested at different time-points
after addition of drugs (see fig. 3) and a sample of
medium from the flask was also taken for determination of
ngf protein content by elisa. cb1093 (kind gift from
dr m. miller at cephalon) was provided at a concentration
of 0.2 mg / ml dissolved in isopropanol. dilutions up to 10
mm were made in isopropanol, with any subsequent
dilution being made in hams f12.  xxxd1714xxx  was dissolved and diluted in hams f12.  xxxd1742xxx  was originally
dissolved in dmso (1:12), pma was originally dissolved
in  xxxd102xxx , 8-bromo camp was dissolved in 1 m
nh 4 oh; all subsequent dilutions were made in hams f12.
for the mobility shift assays, cells were established as
described above and then treated with  xxxd1714xxx  for 30
min, 1 to 4 h prior to harvesting for whole cells extracts.
with cb1093, the time-course was extended to also
include 8, 12, 18 and 24 h.

2.2. rna preparation and northern blot analysis
cells from confluent 25 cm 2 culture flasks were used for
each experiment. total rna was extracted from the cells
using the chomczynski and sacchi method [10]. briefly,
total rna was extracted with phenol:chloroform and
quantified by the optical density reading at 260 nm and the
purity estimated by the 260:280 nm ratio. the yields
ranged from 100 to 200 mg per flask. the purified rna
was subjected to northern blotting. equivalents amounts of
total rna (20–30 mg) were size fractionated in a 1.2%
agarose / formaldehyde gel [33]. ethidium bromide staining
was used to determine the position of the 18 s and 28 s
ribosomal rna subunits and to confirm that equivalent
amounts of undegraded rna had been loaded. the
fractionated rna was transferred from the agarose gel to a
nylon membrane filter (nytran-n membrane pore size
0.45 mm, scheicher and schuell, dassel, germany) by
positive pressure (stratagene posiblotter pressure blotter,
ca, usa), and then permanently fixed to the nytran
membrane by uv crosslinking at 1200 joules (stratagene
uv stratalinker 2400, ca, usa).
the cdna probe for ngf was a mouse 0.92 kb pst1
fragments kindly given by dr alun davies (st andrews
university, scotland). single-stranded antisense dna
probes for ngf (approximate 600 bp) were generated by
asymmetric polymerase chain reaction and simultaneously
labelled with 32-p-dctp. the membrane was hybridized
for 16–18 h following the procedure first devised by
mahmoudi and lin [35]. the membrane was then washed
to a final concentration of 13ssc (75 mm nacl, 7.5 mm
sodium citrate, 5 mm na 2 hpo 4 , 0.015% pyrophosphate
and 0.025%  xxxd3215xxx  ph 7.0), and exposed
to medical x-ray film (18324 cm, fuji photo film co

ltd., japan) at 2708c for 1 week. the autoradiographs
were scanned using the image analyzer (ai systems,
cambridge) and the aden total grey-level densitometry
program.

2.3. ngf enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa)
the assays were carried out as recommended by the
supplier of the reagents (boehringer– mannheim) and
based on a procedure described elsewhere [23]. in brief,
cells were grown to confluence and the medium changed
as described in cell culture methods and treated with the
specific compound for the appropriate period of time. for
each assay, 100 ml aliquots of conditioned medium were
used.

2.4. whole cell extract preparation
cell extracts were prepared as described by dignam et
al. [22] with some modification [2]. briefly, cells (|13
10 6 ) were washed three times with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) and harvested in 4 ml of pbs and
centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min to pellet the cells. the
pbs was removed by aspiration and the cell pellet snap
frozen on dry ice. the packed cell volume was estimated,
and the cells were subsequently thawed on ice in 5
volumes of high salt buffer containing 0.4 m kcl, 20 mm
hepes, ph 7.4, 20% glycerol, 40 mg / ml pmsf, 5 mg / ml
pepstatin a, 5 mg / ml leupeptin and 1 m dtt. cells were
passed through a 25-gauge needle several times to help
lysis. the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm
(centra-sr, international equipment company, dunstable,
uk) for 40 min at 48c. the resulting supernatant, containing the transcription factors was stored in 20 ml
aliquots at 2708c until use. protein concentration of the
supernatant was determined by the coomassie blue
colorimetric assay (biorad, new york, usa).

2.5. preparation of dna probes
synthetic oligonucleotides (20–50 bp) were used as
probes in the protocol described below. prior to labelling
of the synthetic oligonucleotide, the complementary
strands were annealed. 1.6 mg of each of the complementary oligonucleotides were mixed. to this was added 5 ml
of 103te and the final concentration was made up to 50
ml with water. the mixture was heated at 958c for 5 min
and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, thus
allowing the complementary strands to anneal. labelling
proceeded with 32 p-dctp (|6000 ci / mmol, amersham,
uk) using the klenow enzyme. unincorporated nucleotides were removed by ethanol precipitation.
the sequences for the complimentary pairs of oligonucleotides (denoted a and b) used for the annealing
reaction and consequently the labelling reaction are given
below along with the appropriate reference. the sequence

2.6. gel mobility shift assay
the gel mobility shift assay was performed as described
[12]. the assay solution (15 ml) contained 5 mg of nuclear
extract in 30 mm hepes (ph 7.9), 30% glycerol, 10 mg
bsa, 10 mm tris (ph 7.9), 200 mm kcl, 100 mm nacl,
0.6 mm edta, 15 mm mgcl 2 , 1.5 mm dtt, 1 mg of
poly(di–dc) and |300,000 cpm of 32p-labelled oligonucleotide (1 ng of probe). competition binding assay
experiments were carried out by adding to the reaction 100
ng of unlabelled annealed oligonucleotides. the reaction
mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and
then loaded onto an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide
gel. electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature
for 2 h at a constant voltage of 200 v. the gel was dried
under vacuum at 808c for 45 min prior to 24 h exposure to
x-ray film.
all comparisons between treated groups and vehicletreated controls were made by one-way anova followed
by multiple range tests, applied where the f-test indicated
the presence of a significant difference. statistical significance was taken at p,0.05.

the induction of ngf mrna in 3t3 cells, several
modulators of these enzymes were used. peak time-points
were determined in pilots (not shown).  xxxd1742xxx  (10 mm)
caused a 1.8-fold increase in ngf (p,0.05) mrna after
16 h (fig. 1a). 8-bromo camp, (500 mm) a cell permeable
analogue of camp caused a 3.5-fold (p,0.01) increase in
ngf mrna after 16 h (fig. 1b). pma (1 mm) caused a
2-fold increase (over the effect of vehicle; p,0.05) in
ngf mrna after 24 h of incubation (fig. 1c). statistics
derive from three repeats of the experiment as shown.
in l929 cells, treatment with pma (1 mm) caused a
2-fold increase in ngf mrna after 24 h of incubation
(data not shown). this effect was less pronounced than that

seen with cb1093. in contrast, 24 h of  xxxd1742xxx  (10 mm)
treatment had no effect on ngf mrna expression in this
cell line (data not shown).

3.2. ngf mrna and protein levels in 3 t3 and l929
cell lines
in both l929 and 3t3 cells, exposure to cb1093 for 24
h caused a concentration-dependent increase in ngf
mrna when compared to vehicle-treated cells (fig. 2a).
the maximal increase was obtained  xxxd1891xxx  nm in both cell
lines. however in contrast to 3t3 cells, the regression
slope was much steeper and the magnitude of the increase
was much greater in l929 cells; on average a 7-fold
increase in ngf mrna was seen compared to an 80%
increase in ngf mrna expression in 3t3 cells. these
increases in ngf mrna were closely paralleled by
increases in ngf protein in both cell types (fig. 2b and d).
the time-course profile of cb1093 (10 nm) induction of
ngf mrna was investigated in l929 cells. cb1093
increased ngf mrna significantly above vehicle-treated
control flasks by 8 h (fig. 3a and b). this effect was
maintained at 24 and 72 h of treatment. changes in ngf
mrna were mirrored by ngf protein levels with a similar
time-course (fig. 3c). significant increases in ngf protein
levels were evident by 12 h and were maintained up to 72
h of treatment. the basal levels of ngf mrna and
protein in vehicle-treated control flasks were stable through
the 72 h of experimentation indicating that the vehicle
itself did not affect ngf mrna levels.
in 3t3 cells, cb1093 caused a concentration-dependent
increase in ngf mrna when compared to vehicle-treated
cells (fig. 4a and b). the maximal increase was obtained
at a concentration of 10 nm. the changes in ngf mrna
in 3t3 cells were mirrored by similar concentration-dependent changes in ngf protein levels as determined by
elisa; where 10 nm  xxxd1714xxx  caused a significant
increase in ngf protein (fig. 4c). the time-course profile
of  xxxd1714xxx  induction of ngf mrna was also investigated in 3t3 cells. treatment with 10 nm  xxxd1714xxx 
resulted in a significant, but transient increase in ngf
mrna above vehicle-treated controls at 2 h (fig. 5a and
b), followed by a slower increase which was still evident
after 24 h of treatment. changes in ngf mrna were
reflected in the ngf protein levels measured in the culture
medium (fig. 5c). significant increases in ngf protein
levels were evident by 12 h and were still present at 24 h
of treatment. the basal level of ngf mrna and protein in
vehicle-treated control flasks transiently increased at the
initial time-points but stabilised soon thereafter, though the
time-course was quite different to that seen with  xxxd1714xxx . strikingly, exposure of l929 cells to  xxxd1714xxx 
(1 pm to 100 nm) for 24 h caused no significant alteration
in ngf mrna levels (data not shown).

3.3. the effects of propranolol on ngf mrna in 3 t3
cells
the effects of  xxxd1714xxx  on ngf mrna are postulated
to be mediated by b-adrenoceptors. in this experiment,
3t3 cells were treated with  xxxd1714xxx  (10 nm), causing
an increase in ngf mrna to 2.260.5 (p,0.05 compared
to all other groups in this experiment) relative to control
cells (1.060.3). exposure to the b-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (10 nm) in the presence of  xxxd1714xxx 
prevented this increase (0.760.1) and propranolol alone
was without significant effect (0.660.1).

3.4. the effects of  xxxd1714xxx  on transcription factors in
whole cells extracts
mobility shift assays were used to investigate the role of
several putative transcription factors in the induction of
ngf mrna expression in 3t3 cells. using a radiolabeled
synthetic oligonucleotide complimentary to a putative  xxxg1222xxx  site, it was shown that binding activity of the whole cell
extract to the oligonucleotide was increased as early as 30
min after the addition of  xxxd1714xxx  (10 nm) to the culture
medium (fig. 6a and b). the elevation in ap-1 binding
activity was maintained up to 2 h after the addition of
 xxxd1714xxx  before returning to control levels by 4 h. the

changes in ap-1 preceded the changes in ngf mrna
expression seen in this cell line (fig. 5a and b). the effects
of  xxxd1714xxx  on nfk-b binding to a synthetic oligonucleotide were also investigated. treatment with  xxxd1714xxx  did not result in any significant change in nfk-b
binding (data not shown). finally, sp-1 binding activity,
which can be used as a housekeeping element, was also
determined. no significant changes in sp-1 binding activity were seen after treatment with  xxxd1714xxx  (data not
shown).

3.5. effects of cb1093 on the transcription factors
vdr, ap-1 and nfk -b in whole cell extracts
mobility shift assays were used to investigate the role of
several putative transcription factors in the induction of
ngf mrna expression in l929 cells. using radiolabeled
synthetic oligonucleotide complimentary to the  xxxd1682xxx 
nuclear receptor (vdr), it was shown that binding activity
to the nuclear receptor which acts as a transcription factor
itself, was increased as early as 30 min after the addition of
cb1093 to the culture medium (fig. 7a and b). the
elevation in vdr binding activity was maintained through
to 24 h after the addition of cb1093. the changes in vdr
preceded the changes in ngf mrna expression seen in
this cell line. the increase in ngf mrna were not

significantly above control until 6–8 h after addition of
cb1093 (fig. 3).
binding activity to a consensus ap-1 sequence was also
significantly increased after addition of cb1093 (fig. 7c).
a 150% increase in ap-1 binding was achieved. the
increase in ap-1 binding also occurred prior to the changes
in ngf mrna. the effects of cb1093 on nfk-b binding
activity contained in the whole cell extract was also
investigated. treatment with cb1093 did not result in any
significant change in nfk-b binding (data not shown).

4. discussion
the results reported here demonstrate that cb1093 is a
potent inducer of ngf expression in both l929 and 3t3

cells cultured in non-serum containing medium. the
increases in ngf mrna are mirrored by subsequent
elevation of ngf protein levels, and can be mimicked by
agents that induce pkc, such as pma.  xxxg67xxx 
activation was ineffective at inducing ngf mrna in l929
cells. increased binding of vdr to an oligonucleotide
mimic of its transcription site occurred within 1 h of
addition of cb1093 to the culture medium and was
maintained for up to 24 h after the addition of the vitamin
d 3 analogue. a significant increase in ap-1 binding also
occurred prior to increases in ngf mrna expression, but
no significant changes in nfk-b were demonstrated in this
cell line. thus, we propose that cb1093 acts through the
vdr, with possible co-operativity with ap-1, sharing a
mechanism with 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 as reported elsewhere
[40,56]. in our study cb1093 induced ngf expression at
concentrations as low as 100 pm, suggesting that cb1093
is as potent as 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 [56]. furthermore, the
magnitude of the increase resulting from cb1093 treatment was several fold higher than that previously reported
for 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 [56].

ligand activation of steroid hormone receptors causes
them to bind to specific dna sequences with activation or
repression of transcription by rna polymerase ii at a
nearby target gene [6,25,58]. the osteocalcin and calbindin
d-9k genes are regulated by this sequence of events and a
similar mechanism may regulate the transcription of ngf
mrna [19,21,36]. 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 may indirectly modulate
ngf mrna levels through increasing intracellular ca 21
content, promoting immediate early genes, including c-fos
and c-jun [39]. these immediate early gene products are
postulated to enhance ngf gene expression in damaged
sciatic nerve and after b-adrenoceptor stimulation in
cultured astrocytes through the interaction with a putative
ap-1 site on the ngf promoter [27,37].
however, it seems that the mechanism by which 1,25(oh) 2 d 3 controls the levels of ngf transcription differs

from that triggered by the synthesis of c-fos [27,37,56,57].
while serum or pma induced a transient expression of the
c-fos proto-oncogene, 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 failed to do so. the
lack of c-fos activation suggests that 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 enhances the expression of ngf gene by a c-fos-independent
pathway, while serum or pma would mediate their effects
via the c-fos gene product.
recently 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 analogues,  xxxd3192xxx , oct and
calcitriol with lesser calcaemic effects, have been demonstrated to induce ngf synthesis in l929 cells [29,40].
musiol et al. [40], have described competition binding
experiments to determine the affinity of 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 for
the vdr.  xxxd3192xxx  exhibited approximately equal affinity
for vdr, whereas oct bound with 5-fold less affinity for
vdr compared to 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 . both analogues induced
ngf synthesis within 24 h with the same potency as
1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 . the discrepancy between vdr binding and

affinity and potency to induce ngf synthesis may be
influenced by permeability and intracellular bioavailablity.
information about the affinity of cb1093 binding to vdr
is unavailable at this time.
clearly, the capacity of these drugs to stimulate ngf
expression in cns cells is important and l929 mouse
fibroblast-like cells are more sensitive to 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3
than primary astrocytes [43,56]. in this regard, expression
of the 24,25-hydrolase enzyme, which metabolises 1,25(oh) 2 d 3 into a much less potent metabolite 1,24,25-

(oh) 2 d 3 , has been reported in primary cultures of astrocytes [42]. it is also conceivable that the affinity of the
activated vdr for the ngf gene differs in astrocytes from
l929 cells, due either to the presence or absence of
accessory proteins [51] or to post-transcriptional modifications of the vdr, such as phosphorylation [28,31] or
g-carboxylation [54]. alternatively, the accessibility of the
 xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  response element, which remains to be fully
characterized in the ngf gene, could be different in these
two cell types. interestingly vdr has been reported to
form heterodimeric complexes with the 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor [9,32,59]. it is then possible that this receptor and
its ligand constitute modulators able to amplify the effects
of 1,25-(oh) 2 d 3 in vivo.
the interactions between agents such as pma and
 xxxd1742xxx  have also been investigated [16] and suggest that
several distinct pathways interact to regulate ngf production in l929 cells. the stimulation of transcription by
pma has been shown to involve the binding of jun and fos
proteins to the ap-1 element in the promoter regions of
pma-responsive genes [3,14]. the ap-1 element has the
consensus nucleotide sequence tgag / ctca, which is
present within intron 1 of the ngf gene [60], and is bound
by nuclear factors including jun and fos in l929 cells [17].
c-fos and junb mrna have been reported to be induced
by pma prior to increases in ngf mrna levels [16]. this
situation is consistent with a role of fos and jun proteins in
the ngf induction by pma and such a role is also
consistent with the presence of an ap-1 element in the
ngf gene [15,18], the binding of jun and fos proteins to
the ap-1 element and the demonstration that c-fos can
activate ngf gene transcription [17,27]. in addition, the
induction of transcription of a number of genes by pma
involves interaction of jun and fos proteins with ap-1
elements [14]. the essentially complete disappearance of
ngf mrna, despite induction of c-fos and junb mrnas
by pma in the presence of corticosterone, has also been
reported [16] and suggests that the involvement of jun and
fos proteins in the regulation of ngf mrna levels may be
more complex than first visualized. similarly  xxxd1742xxx  and
pma together synergistically induces c-fos and junb
mrnas, yet there is no subsequent increase in ngf
mrna levels as is observed when l929 cells are treated
with pma alone [16].
the results described here also demonstrate that 3t3
cells have the capacity to increase ngf mrna synthesis
when treated with  xxxd1714xxx . the b-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol blocked the effects of  xxxd1714xxx , consolidating the role of the b-adrenoceptor stimulation in
ngf mrna synthesis in this cell line. an immediate
increase in intracellular camp has been reported to occur
following b-adrenoceptor stimulation [37]. this could lead
to the activation of the catalytic subunit of pka, which
either translocates to the nucleus and stimulates gene
expression through the phosphorylation of a nuclear regulatory protein or phosphorylates a cytosolic transcription

protein. there is a time lag of 2 h before the increases in
ngf mrna are evident. this time lag between the
addition of  xxxd1714xxx  to the culture medium and the
increase in ngf gene expression suggests the participation
of other intermediate step(s) following the postulated
increase in camp accumulation.
in the c6 glioma cell line the increase in intracellular
camp levels after b-adrenoceptor stimulation is followed
by the accumulation of c-fos mrna [37]. this is in line
with previous evidence demonstrating that the 59 flanking
regions of c-fos have sequence homology to the regulatory
part of other genes that are camp-inducible, such as those
encoding for  xxxg2276xxx  [26] and somatostatin
[38]. moreover c-fos expression in other cell types can be
enhanced in the presence of high levels of camp [5,7].
the results described in the mobility shift assays in this
paper demonstrate that increased binding of ap-1 to the
promoter region of the ngf gene could be responsible for
the increased expression of ngf mrna. it has been
shown that the ngf gene contains an ap-1 consensus
sequence downstream of the tata box at the junction of
exon 1 and intron 1 which is conserved within the rat and
mouse genes [60]. this ap-1 site has been demonstrated to
play a role in the basal and inducible transcription of the
ngf gene in mouse l929 cells [18,27]. in addition this
site appears to be the major cis-element controlling
expression of the ngf [13]. however, another study has
shown induction of ngf by  xxxd1714xxx  in cerebral cortex,
without induction of ap-1 binding; instead evidence was
found for a role of ccaat / enhancer binding proteins
(c / ebp) [11].
in conclusion, this study has demonstrated stimulation
of ngf expression by two separate mechanisms initiated
by a long-acting b-adrenoceptor agonist and a  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx 
analogue. the two cell lines used were differentially
sensitive to the two mechanisms, both of which activated
transcription factors, indicating that both drugs stimulate
ngf expression via transcription-dependent mechanisms.
since both are also active in vivo, they offer therapeutic
possibilities in neurodegenerative conditions in which
impaired neurotrophic support from ngf may contribute
to the aetiology.
