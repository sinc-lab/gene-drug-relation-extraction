and craig t. january. blockage of the  xxxg1246xxx  human
cardiac k1 channel by the gastrointestinal prokinetic agent
 xxxd1708xxx . am. j. physiol. 273 (heart circ. physiol. 42):
h2534–h2538, 1997.— xxxd1708xxx , a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent, is known to cause long q-t syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. the cellular mechanism is not known.
the human ether-á-go-go-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ), which encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier k1 current and
is important in cardiac repolarization, may serve as a target
for the action of  xxxd1708xxx . we tested the hypothesis that
 xxxd1708xxx  blocks  xxxg1246xxx . the whole cell patch-clamp recording
technique was used to study  xxxg1246xxx  channels stably expressed
heterologously in hek293 cells. under voltage-clamp conditions,  xxxd1708xxx  block of  xxxg1246xxx  is dose dependent with a
half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 6.5 nm at 22°c (n 5
25 cells). currents rapidly recovered with drug washout. the
onset of block by  xxxd1708xxx  required channel activation indicative of open or inactivated state blockage. block of  xxxg1246xxx 
with  xxxd1708xxx  after channel activation was voltage dependent. at 220 mv, 10 nm  xxxd1708xxx  reduced  xxxg1246xxx  tail-current
amplitude by 5%, whereas, at 120 mv, the tail-current
amplitude was reduced by 45% (n 5 4 cells). at 220 and 120
mv, 100 nm  xxxd1708xxx  reduced tail-current amplitude by 66
and 90%, respectively. we conclude that  xxxd1708xxx  is a potent
blocker of  xxxg1246xxx  channels expressed in hek293 cells. this
effect may account for the clinical occurrence of q-t prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias observed with  xxxd1708xxx .
rapidly activating delayed-rectifier potassium current; potassium channels; q-t interval; torsades de pointes; gastrointestinal motility

(propulsid, janssen pharmaceutical) is a
benzamide derivative that is widely used as a prokinetic agent in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal motility disorders, including gastroparesis and
gastroesophageal reflux disease. there have been case
reports of palpitations and prolonged q-t intervals
from  xxxd1708xxx  use dating back to 1989 (13). recently,
the food and drug administration reported 57 cases of
cardiac arrhythmia associated with the use of  xxxd1708xxx 
that it had received through its medwatch reporting
program over a period of 3 years (27). these included 34
cases of torsades de pointes, 23 patients with long q-t
syndrome ( xxxg1268xxx ), and 4 reported deaths.
warmke and ganetzky (25) identified the human
ether-á-go-go-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ), which, when expressed in xenopus oocytes and hek293 cells, has
properties similar to cardiac rapidly activating de-

layed-rectifier k1 current (ikr ) (16, 18, 22, 28).  xxxg1246xxx 
current exhibits nanomolar sensitivity to methanesulfonamides, dependence on external k1 concentration,
and inward rectification.  xxxg1246xxx  mrna is strongly
expressed in the heart of several mammalian species,
including humans (26). mutations in  xxxg1246xxx  have been
shown to cause chromosome 7-linked inherited  xxxg1268xxx 
(5), and several drugs that block ikr cause acquired
 xxxg1268xxx  and torsades de pointes and also have been shown
to block  xxxg1246xxx  (15, 18, 19). thus  xxxg1246xxx  is an important
target in both acquired and inherited forms of  xxxg1268xxx .
the cellular basis for the cardiac electrophysiological
effect of  xxxd1708xxx  is not known.  xxxd1708xxx  was recently
reported to increase action potential duration and to
induce early afterdepolarizations in isolated rabbit
purkinje fibers (14). this raises the possibility that
 xxxd1708xxx  may prolong action potential duration in vivo
and cause  xxxg1268xxx  by inhibiting ikr or  xxxg1246xxx . we used
 xxxg1246xxx  stably transfected hek293 cells to test the
hypothesis that  xxxd1708xxx  is a potent blocker of  xxxg1246xxx 
channel current.
methods

stable transfection.  xxxg1246xxx  cdna (22, 23, 28) was subcloned into bamh i and ecor i sites of the pcdna3 vector
(invitrogen, san diego, ca). this vector contains a cmv
promoter and an sv40 promoter, which drive the expression
of the inserted cdna ( xxxg1246xxx ) and neomycin-resistant gene,
respectively. the hek293 cells were transfected with this
construct using the lipofectamine method (gibco, grand
island, ny). after selection in 800 µg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxd2191xxx ,
gibco) for 15–20 days, single colonies were picked with
cloning cylinders and tested for  xxxg1246xxx  current. the stably
transfected cells were cultured in minimal essential medium
(mem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400
µg/ml  xxxd2191xxx . all cells were from a single cell line producing
high current levels and were stable for .6 mo. for electrophysiological study, the cells were harvested from the culture
dish by trypsinization, washed twice with standard mem
medium, and stored in this medium at room temperature for
later use. cells were studied within 8 h of harvest.
patch-clamp recording technique. cells used for electrophysiological study were transferred to a small cell bath
mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (diaphot,
nikon) and were superfused with n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n8-2-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes)-buffered tyrode solution containing (in mm) 137 nacl, 4 kcl, 1.8 cacl2, 1 mgcl2,
10 glucose, and 10 hepes (ph 7.4 with naoh). solution

pipettes (7, 24). the pipettes had inner diameters of 1–1.5 µm
and, when filled with the internal pipette solution, had
resistances of 2–4 mv. the internal pipette solution contained (in mm) 130 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 5 ethylene glycol-bis(baminoethyl ether)-n,n,n8,n8-tetraacetic acid, 5 mgatp, and
10 hepes (ph 7.2 with koh). an axopatch 1d patch-clamp

within 48 h of experiments by diluting stock solution with the
extracellular hepes-buffered tyrode solution. ethanol control (n 5 3 cells), at a concentration (0.01%) equivalent to the
highest  xxxd1708xxx  dilution studied, had no effect on  xxxg1246xxx 
current. other chemicals were purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo).

results

the effect of  xxxd1708xxx  on  xxxg1246xxx  current was studied
in a stably transfected hek293 cell line. figure 1, a
and b, shows voltage-clamp data obtained with 100 nm
 xxxd1708xxx . families of current traces from one cell are
shown for control conditions (fig. 1a) and after exposure to  xxxd1708xxx  (fig. 1b), with the voltage-clamp
protocol shown in fig. 1a, inset. cells were clamped at
a holding potential of 280 mv. depolarizing steps were

applied for 4 s to voltages between 260 and 150 mv in
10-mv increments. for control conditions, depolarizing
steps activated a time-dependent outward current that
increased in amplitude with more positive voltage steps
to reach a maximum at 110 mv. depolarizing steps to
more positive voltages resulted in inward rectification.
after the repolarizing step to 250 mv, an outward tail
current was recorded. tail-current amplitude, measured as the difference between the peak current and
leak-corrected baseline current at 250 mv, increased
with depolarizing steps from 260 to 120 mv and was
then superimposed on further depolarizing steps to
150 mv.  xxxd1708xxx  (100 nm) suppressed both the
outward and tail currents, as shown in fig. 1b. in other
experiments, zhou et al. (28) showed that  xxxg1246xxx 
current in these cells is blocked nearly completely by
e-4031 (300 nm). finally, there is minimal contamination of  xxxg1246xxx  current in these cells by endogenous
current, as shown in fig. 1c in the current records
obtained from a nontransfected hek293 cell.
current-voltage plots of steady-state current present
at the end of the depolarizing step and peak tail current
are depicted in fig. 1, d and e, respectively, before and
after exposure to 100 nm  xxxd1708xxx  (n 5 4 cells). for
control conditions, the threshold for activating  xxxg1246xxx 
current was close to 240 mv and full activation was
obtained at voltages near 120 mv. in the presence of
100 nm  xxxd1708xxx , steady-state current and peak tailcurrent amplitude were reduced compared with control
conditions.

fig. 2. block by  xxxd1708xxx  requires channel activation.  xxxg1246xxx  channels were rapidly activated by a 100-ms depolarization step to 160
mv from a holding potential of 280 mv and then clamped to 110 mv
for 10 s before tail currents were obtained by repolarization to 250
mv. control current, current activated by first depolarizing step after
a 10-min-long exposure to 100 nm  xxxd1708xxx , and the current obtained
after 10 min of drug washout are shown.

long depolarizing step to 160 mv (see ref. 18) from a
holding potential of 280 mv, and the cell was then
clamped at 110 mv for 10 s. tail currents were
recorded after repolarization to 250 mv. the control
current, the current activated by the first depolarizing
step after a 10-min-long exposure to 100 nm  xxxd1708xxx ,
and the current obtained after 10 min of drug washout
are shown. the cell was held at 280 mv during the
washin and washout periods. after drug washin, the
initial outward current amplitude with the first depolarizing step was only slightly decreased compared with
control current, indicating little closed-state block. the
outward current amplitude subsequently decreased
during the depolarizing step to reach maximal block.
current was recovered nearly completely after 10 min
of drug washout.
 xxxd1708xxx  block of  xxxg1246xxx  current was concentration
dependent. steady-state block was obtained by applying depolarizing steps from 280 to 110 mv for a 20-s
period every 30 s, and peak tail current was measured
after repolarizing steps to 250 mv for 5 s at different
drug concentrations. analysis of the data obtained from
a total of 25 cells with the hill equation gave a
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50 ) value of
6.5 nm. the decrease in peak tail current as a function
of drug concentration is shown in fig. 3.
block of  xxxg1246xxx  current by  xxxd1708xxx  varied with
voltage, exhibiting a higher degree of block at more
positive voltages, as shown in fig. 4. in four transfected
cells, 10 nm  xxxd1708xxx  at 220 mv reduced peak tailcurrent amplitude by 5% from 282 6 91 to 268 6 77 pa
(p . 0.05), whereas at 120 mv it reduced peak
tail-current amplitude by 45% from 944 6 89 to 511 6
97 pa (p , 0.05). at 100 nm  xxxd1708xxx , the voltage
dependence of drug block was again evident, with
 xxxg1246xxx  current reduced from 232 6 95 to 80 6 17 pa
(66% reduction) and from 1,010 6 48 to 96 6 55 pa
(90% reduction), at 220 and 120 mv, respectively (see
fig. 1; p , 0.05 compared with control). the amount of

fig. 3. block of  xxxg1246xxx  by  xxxd1708xxx  is concentration dependent.
 xxxg1246xxx  tail-current amplitude, normalized to control, is plotted as a
function of  xxxd1708xxx  concentration. data were fitted with hill
equation, giving a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50 ) of 6.5
nm and a hill coefficient of 0.85. nos. in parentheses, no. of cells.

block at each drug concentration was greater at 120
mv than at 220 mv (p , 0.05). thus  xxxd1708xxx  block of
 xxxg1246xxx  current exhibits voltage dependence.
discussion

several reports of cardiac arrhythmias with the use
of  xxxd1708xxx  have appeared in the literature over the
last decade (1, 2, 13). recently, the food and drug
administration reported 57 cases of torsades de pointes

and/or q-t prolongation in patients that were administered  xxxd1708xxx  (27). the development of q-t prolongation and torsades de pointes in  xxxd1708xxx  users frequently appeared to be associated with the concomitant
use of medications that compete for drug metabolism
by the cytochrome p-450 3a4 isozyme, the presence of
renal insufficiency, and with administration of high
doses of  xxxd1708xxx .
after oral administration, total  xxxd1708xxx  peak serum
values of 60–80 µg/l (120–170 nm) are achieved, of
which .95% is plasma protein bound (11, 25a). the
drug is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome
p-450 enzyme system in the liver with an elimination
half-life of ,10 h. the half-life of  xxxd1708xxx  may be
prolonged in patients with hepatic disease and in the
elderly (11). coadministration of drugs metabolized
through the cytochrome p-450 enzyme system can also
result in higher drug levels.
the results of our study demonstrate that  xxxd1708xxx 
is a potent blocker of  xxxg1246xxx  channels expressed heterologously in hek293 cells. the drug concentrations we
studied were similar to the therapeutic levels achieved
in the clinical use of this drug. we conclude that
blockage of  xxxg1246xxx  current may underlie the proarrhythmic effect of  xxxd1708xxx . thus this report shows  xxxg1246xxx  to
be a molecular target for the action of  xxxd1708xxx  and
may help to explain the mechanism of q-t prolongation
and occurrence of torsades de pointes with this drug.
block of  xxxg1246xxx  by  xxxd1708xxx  was voltage dependent.
drug block does not occur via closed-state block, because nearly normal peak outward current was recorded on the first depolarizing step after drug washin,
as shown in fig. 2. rather, the onset of  xxxg1246xxx -current
block by  xxxd1708xxx  required channel activation, suggestive of open- or inactivated-state drug block. our protocols, however, do not easily distinguish between openand inactivated-state block. in the study of  xxxd1708xxx 
block of  xxxg1246xxx , it is important to recognize that the
ic50 of drug block is voltage dependent.
 xxxd1708xxx  is a widely used gastrointestinal prokinetic
agent in humans and animals.  xxxd1708xxx  augments
motility throughout the gastrointestinal tract and is
used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastroparesis (3, 25a). the mechanism of
action is not fully elucidated but is thought to be
through the release of acetylcholine mediated by postganglionic nerve endings in the myenteric plexus of
the gut (9).  xxxd1708xxx  is an agonist of serotonin [5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)] at the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor as
well as an antagonist at the  xxxg1116xxx  (4).  xxxd1708xxx 
seems to enhance gastroduodenal motility in humans
by enhancing cholinergic transmission through stimulation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors on the enteric nerve endings
(17, 21, see also ref. 20).  xxxd1708xxx  also has a direct
stimulating effect on gastrointestinal smooth muscle
tissue without the involvement of 5-ht receptors. in
experiments with guinea pig stomach circular smooth
muscle,  xxxd1708xxx  was found to cause depolarization of
the muscle membrane (6), and, in taenia coli preparations from guinea pig colon,  xxxd1708xxx  was shown to
cause depolarization, enhancement of spike activity,

h2537

increases in muscle tone, and potentiation of contraction (12).
our findings raise the possibility that the prokinetic
effect of  xxxd1708xxx  may be explained, in part, by its
blockage of gastrointestinal k1 channels located either
on the smooth muscle cells of the gut or on the
presynaptic nerve terminals of the myenteric plexus.
recent reports showed widespread distribution of
 xxxg1246xxx  mrna in different tissues, including small
intestine (26). it is possible that  xxxd1708xxx  causes
membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells or
causes release of excitatory neurotransmitters from
nerve endings by blocking  xxxg1246xxx  channels present in
the gastrointestinal tract. further studies are needed
to define the cellular distribution of  xxxg1246xxx  in the
gastrointestinal tract and the possible interaction of
 xxxg1246xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx  in the gut.
the findings of this study have several important
implications. our study shows that  xxxd1708xxx  in low
concentrations blocks  xxxg1246xxx ; therefore, this may be the
mechanism responsible for the q-t prolongation and
torsades de pointes associated with  xxxd1708xxx  use in
humans. moreover, the concentration of drug associated with 50% block in vitro (ic50 5 6.5 nm) is within
the therapeutic range achieved with oral dosing in
humans. the reason that arrhythmic effects are not
observed more frequently may be due to the fact that
.95% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. only
when high free-drug levels are achieved, such as from
liver disease, drugs competing for metabolism, or overdosage, do q-t prolongation and torsades de pointes
occur. in addition, these findings may prove helpful in
developing newer and safer gastrointestinal prokinetic
drugs devoid of the undesirable side effects of q-t
prolongation.
because we only studied  xxxg1246xxx -transfected cells,
possible effects of  xxxd1708xxx  on other membrane currents cannot be excluded. in addition, we did not study
the effects of metabolites, such as norcisapride, on
 xxxg1246xxx  current. therefore, in vivo contributions by the
metabolites to the drug effects cannot be excluded.
finally,  xxxd1708xxx  has been demonstrated to be a partial
agonist of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in human right atrium. this
mechanism is unlikely to be important in the genesis of
ventricular arrhythmias because of the absence of
functional  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the human ventricle (8).
in conclusion,  xxxd1708xxx  blocks  xxxg1246xxx -encoded channels expressed in hek293 cells. this effect may account
for the clinical occurrence of q-t prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias observed with the use of  xxxd1708xxx . this is
a new class of drugs shown to block  xxxg1246xxx , further
supporting the evidence that  xxxg1246xxx  is an important target
for many cardiovascular and noncardiovascular drugs.
