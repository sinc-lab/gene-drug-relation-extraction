abstract. severe gastro-intestinal complications are a major
cause of nsaid-induced deaths in cases of rheumatoid
arthritis. we measured cox selectivity by using an intact
cell assay system, and found that ns-398 is a highly cox-2–
selective inhibitor.  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2065xxx  and diclofenac also
showed high cox-2 selectivity. zaltoprofen, loxoprofensrs (active metabolite of loxoprofen), 6-mna (active
metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx ) and ibuprofen showed intermediate cox-2 selectivity. the lowest cox-2 selectivities,
which means the highest cox-1 selectivities, were observed
in indomethacin, aspirin, and  xxxd2807xxx . there appears to be
a good relationship between our data and some clinical data
of severe gastro-intestinal toxicity. the more a given nsaid
is selective for cox-2, the safer it is for clinical use. in
conclusion, to anticipate the safety of nsaids, we find that
an intact cell assay system, using human cells for measurement of cox selectivity, may be more useful than using
direct enzyme assay systems.

61% homology. however, cox-1 is constitutively
expressed in the various cells, whereas cox-2 is inducible
in the cells, especially at sites of inflammation.
it has been proposed that cox-1 inhibition in gastric
mucosal cells and the resultant decreased synthesis of
prostaglandins, with loss of local protective effect, accounts
for the significant gastric toxicity of nsaids [6]. cox-2
activity, which parallels the onset of inflammation and
produces pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, is theoretically a
more selective therapeutic target for nsaids. there is still
insufficient information, however, as to whether the cox-2–
selective nsaids have a lower risk of adverse events in
clinical use. in this paper, i will first summarize the clinical
effectiveness of and adverse events associated with nsaids,
especially for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. then, i will
try to analyze the relationship between cox selectivity and
the risk of gastro-intestinal complications of various nsaids.

rheumatoid arthritis and cox
cox-2 in the synovial cells of patients with rheumatoid
arthritis plays an important role in the inflammatory process
[7]. sano and others [8] analyzed human synovial tissue from
patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, by using
the immunostaining method. the intensity of the staining
with anti-cox antibody, not specific for cox-1 or cox-2,
in the rheumatoid synovial tissue was significantly enhanced,
compared to that found in osteoarthritic tissue. the extent
and intensity of mononuclear cell infiltration, suggesting
active inflammation, correlated well with the intensity of the
cox staining. we also found that interleukin-1b (il-1b) and
 xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ), considered major factors
in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis [9], enhanced the
production of prostaglandin (pg) e2 in human synovial cells
[10], whereas il-2, il-4, il-6, and interferon-g showed no
activity. this evidence suggests that an increase in the cox
enzyme and pge2 overproduction, induced by il-1b and
 xxxg2296xxx , may play an important role in synovial inflammation
in rheumatoid arthritis.

introduction
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) produce
their therapeutic and toxic effects by decreasing the
biosynthesis of prostaglandins [1]. this decrease is accomplished by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox) or
prostaglandin g/h synthase [2]. recent studies have shown
that cox exists in 2 isoenzyme forms [3, 4], which differ in
their basal expression, tissue localization, and induction
during inflammation [5]. the existence of these 2 cox
isoenzymes, each with its own characteristics, may help
explain differences in the pharmacological profiles of
various nsaids, and may have important clinical consequences. the amino acids in these two isoenzymes have

arthritis [11]. the authors analyzed the deaths of 1666
patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and found that 47 of them
had died from adverse effects of anti-rheumatic drugs.
among these adverse effects, 30 were attributable to
nsaids. these were the most common cause of druginduced deaths in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. severe
gastro-intestinal complications were major causes of these
nsaid-induced deaths in cases of rheumatoid arthritis.
after the discovery of cox-2, drug companies began to
develop many highly selective cox-2 inhibitors. however,
we do not yet have postmarketing information of the adverse
effects of these drugs. then, it might be useful to know the
cox selectivity of the various commercially available
nsaids. some of the drug companies already have
enough information on the adverse effects of these drugs in
actual clinical use.

of tender join count was significantly lower 4 weeks after the
administration of nsaid a. at the same time, the mean
value of the disability index, obtained by the results of a
health assessment questionnaire that indicated patient
activity in daily living, also showed improvement after
treatment with nsaid a. in contrast, the same indices did
not change after administration of placebo. this nsaid is
thus effective in improving the quality of life of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis, especially by its analgesic, and possibly
by its anti-inflammatory actions, due to suppression of pg
production.
toxicity of nsaids in rheumatoid arthritis
nsaid treatment sometimes causes severe adverse reactions. table 1 shows the results of a retrospective study from
finland about the causes of death in patients with rheumatoid

measurement of cox selectivity
aceclofenac is a nsaid that is already approved for use in
spain and other european countries. major metabolites of
aceclofenac are 40 -hydroxy aceclofenac, diclofenac, and 40 hydroxy diclofenac. we measured the inhibitory activity of
these compounds for microsomal cox-1, obtained from
sheep seminal vesicular glands, and for cox-2, isolated
from sheep placenta [12]. diclofenac showed inhibitory
activity on the cox-1 enzyme, whereas aceclofenac, 40 hydroxy aceclofenac, and 40 -hydroxy diclofenac showed no
inhibitory activity. for cox-2, both aceclofenac and 40 hydroxy aceclofenac showed no inhibitory activity, however, 40 -hydroxy diclofenac and diclofenac inhibited enzyme
activity. thus, we considered that aceclofenac was a
prodrug, which acted after conversion to the cox-2
inhibitors, diclofenac and 40 -hydroxy diclofenac. however,
the serum concentrations of diclofenac and 40 -hydroxy
diclofenac, after oral administration of aceclofenac, were
less than 5% of the mother compound [13].
we then tried to measure the inhibitory activity of
aceclofenac on pge2 production using human rheumatoid

cox selectivity in intact human cell assay
we used intact human cell assay systems to measure the
cox selectivity of various commercially available nsaids
[10]. since rheumatoid arthritis is one of the major clinical
applications of nsaids, our study was designed to
characterize the cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitory activities of
various nsaids, using human platelets and synovial cells,
respectively. the presence and de novo production of these
enzymes were confirmed by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analyses, as well as by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction. only the cox-1 enzyme was
detected in human platelets. in contrast, unstimulated human
synovial cells expressed small amounts of both of cox-1
and cox-2. however, treatment by il-1b only enhanced the
expression of cox-2 mrna and its enzyme. mean ic50
values (mmol/l) for human platelet cox-1 and il-1b–
stimulated human synovial cell cox-2, and the cox-1/
cox-2 ic50 ratio of various nsaids are shown in table 2.
ns-398 is a highly selective cox-2–inhibitor which was
developed by taisho pharmaceutical company in japan. this
agent demonstrates the highest cox-2 selectivity in our
system, as suggested by futaki and others [15]. all other
nsaids except  xxxd2561xxx  are available for clinical use in
japan.  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2065xxx  and diclofenac showed high cox2 selectivity in our assay system. zaltoprofen, loxoprofen-srs
(active metabolite of loxoprofen), and 6-mna (active
metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx ) showed some cox-2 selectivity.
the lowest cox-2 selectivity, which means the highest
cox-1 selectivity, was observed for ibuprofen, indomethacin,
aspirin, and  xxxd2807xxx .

synovial cells. aceclofenac inhibits pge2 production, which
means it also inhibits cox activity. in addition, intracellular
conversion of aceclofenac into the active metabolites,
diclofenac and 40 -hydroxy diclofenac, was detected in
several kinds of inflammatory cells, including synovial and
polymorphonuclear cells. thus, we arrived at the hypothesis
that aceclofenac acts as an intracellular-targeted prodrug
(fig. 2). this also suggests that an intact cell assay system
may be more useful for the detection of cox selectivity than
a direct enzyme assay system.
laneuville and others [14] used recombinant cox-1 and
cox-2 enzymes, expressed in cos-7 cells, for detection of
ic50 values for various nsaids. most nsaids exhibited
appreciable affinities towards cox-1 and cox-2, but 3
nsaids, indomethacin,  xxxd2969xxx , and phenylbutazone, did
not show any inhibitory effect against cox-2 in their assay
system. these nsaids all have analgesic and antiinflammatory activities, both in animal models of inflammation, and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. in some cases,
the use of direct enzyme assay systems for measuring cox
selectivity may be inappropriate for estimating the actual
amount of cox-2 inhibition of various nsaids.

table 2. cyclooxygenase (cox) activity for
various non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory
drugs (nsaids). higher ic50 ratios of cox-1/
cox-2 indicate selectivity for cox-2.

cox selectivity and gastro-intestinal complications
several investigators have suggested that cox-2–selective
nsaids may have greater clinical utility, because they
exhibit lower gastric and renal toxicities, and have a weaker
effect on platelet function, compared to non–cox-2–
selective nsaids [5, 16]. thus, the most important information for the clinical application of cox-2–selective inhibitors

may be more useful than using a direct enzyme assay system.
although other factors, including differences in biological
half-life, whether a given nsaid is a prodrug or not, the
buffering action of the tablets, delivery systems, and so on,
may influence the severe gastro-intestinal complications of
nsaids, the cox-2 selectivity of nsaids may contribute,
at least in part, to lowering the incidence of gastro-intestinal
toxicity.

is whether such agents show any clinical superiority in their
risk/benefit ratio.
henry and others [17] report a meta-analysis of the risk
of severe gastro-intestinal complications with several
nsaids in 12 clinical studies. they categorized various
nsaids into 3 relative risk groups. the low-risk group
comprised ibuprofen and diclofenac. the intermediate-risk
group consisted of aspirin,  xxxd3259xxx , naproxen, high doses of
ibuprofen, and indomethacin. the high-risk group included
 xxxd2969xxx ,  xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd3396xxx , and azapropazone. in our
study, diclofenac showed high cox-2 selectivity, ibuprofen
showed no selectivity, and indomethacin and aspirin both
showed selectivity for cox-1, suggesting a lower incidence
of adverse drug effects of the higher cox-2–selective
nsaids.
recently, singh and others [18] reported a comparative
study of serious gastro-intestinal toxicity of nsaids in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis in north america. table 3
shows a comparison between singh’s clinical data for
nsaid-induced severe gastro-intestinal events, and the
rank order of cox-2 selectivity for various nsaids, as
determined by laneuville and others [14], and us [table 2].
there appears to be some relationship between laneuville’s
direct enzyme assay data and severe gastrointestinal toxicity.
however, as already mentioned, it is a major concern that the
ic50 values of some nsaids, such as  xxxd2969xxx  and
indomethacin, cannot be detected. in contrast, from our
data, derived from the use of an intact human cell assay
system, we discovered almost parallel rank order. the more
a given nsaid is selective for cox-2, the safer it is for
clinical use except in the case of  xxxd2688xxx .  xxxd2688xxx  is
a prodrug converted to an active metabolite, 6-mna, after
absorption. since prodrugs are considered to be safer
nsaids especially in connection with gastrointestinal
events, the lower gastro-intestinal toxicity of  xxxd2688xxx 
may be explained by the characteristics of a prodrug, not by
those of cox-2 selectivity.
in conclusion, we find that an intact cell assay system,
using human tissue for measurement of cox selectivity,

post-presentation discussion
questioner: you emphasized gastric lesions in clinical
studies. what about the effectiveness of cox-2 inhibitors on
rheumatoid arthritis?
dr. kawai: i think that is a most important point. we could
note a comparative potency of the nsaids by measuring
ic50 values, however i think it’s very difficult to evaluate the
actual effectiveness of nsaids on rheumatoid arthritis by
different dosage protocol. we need to know more about the
effectiveness.
questioner: do you think that the clinical effect of cox-2
inhibitors on rheumatoid arthritis or signs of rheumatoid
arthritis is much higher than that of classical nsaids?
dr. kawai: i don’t think so. i think actually it depends on the
dosage of nsaids. with recently developed drugs, the doses
for clinical use were decided as relatively low doses. the
general impression that higher cox-2 selective nsaids have
relatively lower effectiveness, may possibly be explained by
their lower doses for clinical use especially in japan.
sir john vane: i think your work shows and confirms
very nicely the conclusion that the more specific you are
towards cox-2, the less effects you’ll have in damaging the
stomach.
