caffeine attenuates the duration of coronary vasodilation and changes in hemodynamics induced by  xxxd3091xxx  ( xxxd3091xxx ), a novel adenosine a2a rece...  effects of caffeine on  xxxd3091xxx -induced coronary vasodilation and changes in hemodynamics were examined in conscious dogs. sixteen dogs were chronically instrumented for measurements of coronary blood flow (cbf), mean arterial pressure (map), and heart rate (hr).  xxxd3091xxx  (5 microg/kg, iv) increased cbf from 34 +/- 2 to 191 +/- 7 ml/min. the duration of the 2-fold increase in cbf was 515 +/- 71 seconds.  xxxd3091xxx  decreased map by 15 +/- 2% and increased hr by 114 +/- 14%.  xxxd3091xxx -induced maximum increases in cbf were not significantly lower in the presence of caffeine at 1, 2, 4, and 10 mg/kg (2 +/- 3, 0.7 +/- 3, 16 +/- 5, and 13 +/- 8%, respectively; all p > 0.05). caffeine at 1, 2, 4, and 10 mg/kg significantly decreased the duration of the 2-fold increase in cbf induced by  xxxd3091xxx  by 17% +/- 4%, 48% +/- 8%, 62% +/- 5%, and 82% +/- 5%, respectively (all p < 0.05). caffeine at 4 and 10 mg/kg significantly attenuated the effects of  xxxd3091xxx  on map and hr. the results indicate that 1 to 10 mg/kg caffeine dose-dependently reduced the duration, but not the peak increase of cbf caused by 5 microg/kg  xxxd3091xxx .
