our previous work demonstrated that the type i
 xxxg931xxx  ( xxxg931xxx ) resides exclusively and
constitutively within membrane rafts in ␣t3-1 gonadotropes and that this association was necessary for the ability of the receptor to couple to the
erk signaling pathway. g␣q, c-raf, and calmodulin
have also been shown to reside in this compartment, implicating a raft-associated multiprotein
signaling complex as a functional link between the
 xxxg931xxx  and erk signaling. in the studies reported
here, we used subcellular fractionation and coimmunoprecipitation to analyze the behavior of erks
with respect to this putative signaling platform.

coimmunoprecipitated with  xxxg1366xxx  from these fractions. collectively, these data support a model in
which coupling of the  xxxg931xxx  to the erk pathway
in gonadotropes involves the assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex in association with specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane.

tracellular calcium stores, as well as influx of extracellular calcium through l-type voltage-gated channels
(2, 3). gnrh also induces rapid activation of the mapk
pathways, of which the erk pathway has been most
thoroughly characterized. in gonadotropes, activation
of the erk pathway has been linked to the expression
of a complement of immediate early genes such as
c-fos (4, 5), atf-3 (6), and per-1 (7), as well as several
genes essential for gonadotrope function, including
the glycoprotein hormone ␣-subunit (8), the lh␤ subunit (5, 9), and a regulatory mapk phosphatase
(mkp2) (10). several requirements for erk activation
by gnrh have been defined, including influx of extracellular calcium through l-type voltage-gated calcium
channels (11), activation of protein kinase c isozymes
(12, 13), and calmodulin (14). nevertheless, the precise
mechanism by which the  xxxg931xxx  couples to the erk
pathway remains unclear.
an important mechanism for regulation of signaling
activity that has received widespread attention in recent years involves compartmentalization of signaling
molecules through association with specialized low-

( xxxg931xxx ) have been the subject of much investigation.
in gonadotropes, the  xxxg931xxx  couples to g␣q/11, leading to activation of phospholipase c␤, and subsequent
elaboration of the second messengers, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and diacylglycerol (1). diacylglycerol-dependent activation of protein kinase c
isozymes contribute to a sharp rise in intracellular
calcium concentration, which derives from both phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-mediated release of infirst published online october 26, 2006

density membrane microdomains, termed “membrane
rafts” (15–17). these domains are cholesterol- and
sphingolipid-rich regions of membrane that appear in
many cell types to function as platforms for the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes (18). rafts
are enriched in lipid species with highly saturated acyl
chains, particularly glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin (19). interactions between sphingolipids and
cholesterol contribute to the formation of a liquidordered (lo) phase. the lo phase is described as a
localized lipid environment in which the acyl chains of
individual lipid molecules assume an extended, closely
packed, and highly ordered conformation akin to a gel
phase, but in which the lipids retain high lateral mobility within the plane of the membrane, as in a fluid
phase (20). liquid-ordered domains present a unique
membrane environment for which integral and peripheral membrane proteins may show highly different affinities. these domains thus provide a mechanism for
regulation of protein-protein interactions through the
partitioning of individual proteins into, or out of, lo
regions.
we have previously reported that the  xxxg931xxx  resides constitutively and exclusively within a detergentresistant, low-density membrane environment in
␣t3-1 gonadotrope cells (21). cholesterol depletion
shifted the receptor into a detergent-soluble nonraft
environment and led to a reversible blockade of erk
activation by gnrh. the  xxxg1027xxx  g␣q/11,
as well as c-raf, the putative upstream activator of the
erk pathway in these cells, colocalized with the receptor in low-density membrane fractions, suggesting
that these membrane domains may be of functional
significance in coupling the  xxxg931xxx  to components of
the erk pathway (21). to further explore this model,
we now report the use of subcellular fractionation
techniques to examine the behavior of the erk proteins with respect to association with low-density
membrane domains. we find that erks 1 and 2 associate with low-density domains of the plasma membrane in conjunction with the  xxxg931xxx  in a constitutive
and cholesterol-dependent manner, both in ␣t3-1 gonadotropes and in whole mouse pituitary. membraneassociated erks are activated rapidly after exposure
of cells to a gnrh agonist. in addition, the  xxxg931xxx  and
erks coimmunoprecipitate from low-density membrane preparations, lending further support for our
model of a raft-associated multiprotein signaling complex as a functional link between the  xxxg931xxx  and the
erk signaling module.

membrane gm1 and has been used as a marker for
gm1-enriched plasma-membrane subdomains in living cells (22). we have reported biochemical data indicating that the  xxxg931xxx  resides constitutively within
low-density membrane domains in a cholesterol-dependent manner (21). to further characterize the tendency of the  xxxg931xxx  to partition into subdomains of
the plasma membrane, we probed ␣t3-1 cells that
stably express a  xxxg931xxx -green fluorescent protein
(gfp) fusion protein with alexa-594-conjugated ctxb
and examined the cells by laser confocal scanning
microscopy (fig. 1).  xxxg931xxx -gfp localized exclusively
to the plasma membrane and colocalized with gm1positive domains. as a control, endogenously expressed transferrin receptor did not colocalize with
ctxb-alexa-594/gm1 -positive membrane domains,
suggesting that  xxxg931xxx  colocalization with gm1 was
specific in this assay. consistent with our previous
biochemical studies, these data indicate that the  xxxg931xxx  resides constitutively within regions of the
plasma membrane marked by gm1.
anti- xxxg931xxx  immune serum binds specifically to
its cognate epitope in both immunoblotting and
immunohistochemical applications
the anti- xxxg931xxx  antibody used in these studies was
raised against a conserved region of the second extracellular loop of the mammalian type i  xxxg931xxx . to
validate the performance of this antibody in the studies
reported here, we treated ␣t3-1 cells with gnrha (the
gnrh agonist  xxxd387xxx ) for various time periods and
examined whole-cell lysates for  xxxg931xxx  protein expression by immunoblot analysis. as shown in fig. 2a,
the  xxxg931xxx  antiserum generated a predominant band
of immunoreactivity of approximately 50 kda. consistent with previous reports of gnrh-induced up-regulation of  xxxg931xxx  in gonadotropes (23), the target of
this antibody showed clear up-regulation in response
to gnrha. when used for immunohistochemical examination of sections of mouse pituitary, the same
antiserum discretely marked a subpopulation of cells
within the anterior lobe; costaining with an antibody
against lh␤ subunit indicated nearly complete colocalization of  xxxg931xxx  and lh␤ immunofluorescence
(fig. 2b). these validation studies provide evidence
that this antibody recognizes both denatured and nondenatured conformations of its cognate epitope on the
 xxxg931xxx  with high specificity.
erk 2 associates constitutively with detergentresistant, low-density membrane domains in
␣t3-1 cells
we previously reported that the  xxxg931xxx , g␣q/11, and
c-raf, the putative upstream activator of the erk signaling pathway in gonadotropes, associate constitutively with low-density, detergent-resistant membrane
domains (drms) in ␣t3-1 cells (21). based on these
data, we proposed that raft domains may play a key

a, ␣t3-1 cells transiently expressing a  xxxg931xxx -gfp fusion protein were stained with alexa 594-conjugated ctxb and fixed.
confocal images of the separated fluorescence channels show membrane localization of the  xxxg931xxx -gfp (green channel) and
alexa 594 gm1 (red channel). merged images show the overlay of the two flurophores. ␣t3-1 cells were stained for gm1 using

analysis, the merged  xxxg931xxx -gfp and alexa 594 gm1 image was computed and expressed as a scatter diagram. colocalization
of fluorophores produces a clean diagonal line running from the bottom left to the top right indicating that  xxxg931xxx  and gm1 are
colocalized on the plasma membrane. in contrast, differences between fluorescence localization causes an irregular distribution
in the scatter diagram indicating that tfr and gm1 display little colocalization.

role in gnrh-induced erk activation by serving as a
platform for the association of key intermediates of
this signaling pathway. to further explore this model,
we fractionated ␣t3-1 cells in the presence of 0.1%
triton x-100 and analyzed low-density fractions for the
presence of the erk proteins. a small proportion of
total cellular erk 2 partitioned constitutively into lowdensity fractions (fig. 3a). when the microsomal suspensions in the low-density fractions were rehomogenized and repelleted by high-speed centrifugation,
erk immunoreactivity appeared only in the membrane
pellet, indicating that the erk protein recovered in
association with drms is indeed membrane-associated (data not shown). phosphorylated erk was detected in the low-density fractions within 5 min of
gnrha administration, and the kinetics of activation of
membrane-associated erk appeared to parallel the
kinetics of non-membrane-associated erk. (fig. 3b).
consistent with our previous results, the  xxxg931xxx , as
well as the g␣q/11 heterotrimeric g-protein subunit and
the lipid raft marker flotillin-1, associated preferentially
with the low-density fractions (fig. 3a). as a further
control, the membrane-associated ␣1-subunit of the
l-type voltage-gated calcium channel was not present
in low-density fractions. this latter observation supports the specificity of the fractionation method and
provides a useful negative control for analysis of membrane rafts in gonadotropes.
the drms analyzed in fig. 3 were isolated after
homogenization of cells in the presence of 0.1% triton
x-100. under these conditions, the association of

erks with low-density membranes was unaffected by
administration of gnrha (data not shown). in contrast,
homogenization of unstimulated cells in the presence
of 1.0% triton x-100 interrupted the association of
erks with drms (fig. 4a). however, after 15 min of
exposure to gnrha, the association of erks with
drms was rendered refractory to the effects of highdetergent concentration (fig. 4a). phosphorylated
erk was also detected in the low-density fractions of
gnrha-treated cells after homogenization in the presence of the higher detergent concentration (fig. 4b).
this observation is consistent with the behavior of
c-raf under similar experimental conditions and suggests that the signaling activity induced by  xxxg931xxx 
occupancy is capable of stabilizing interactions
among the participants of a putative raft-associated
signaling complex.
 xxxg1366xxx  and the  xxxg931xxx  associate preferentially
with low-density membranes isolated in the
absence of detergent
resistance to detergent solubilization is an important
operational characteristic of membrane rafts (24). indeed, sucrose density gradient centrifugation of cell
homogenates prepared in the presence of low concentrations of nonionic detergents remains the most
common method for isolation of these membrane domains. however, controversy remains regarding the
effects of detergents on cellular membranes, and
some evidence suggests that detergent solubilization

may itself enhance the ability of lipid bilayers to adopt
a lo conformation (25). to further assess the validity of
our observations regarding the association of erks
with drms, we adapted a technique based on sucrose
density gradient centrifugation of postnuclear supernatant for fractionation of subcellular membranes in
the absence of detergent (specific protocol found at
http://www.i-med.ac.at/cellbio/downloads/preparative_
gradients.rtf). using this method, huber and colleagues (30) describe clear separation of low-, intermediate-, and high-density subcellular membrane
fractions enriched in late endosomes/lysosomes, early
endosomes, and plasma membrane, respectively. we
reasoned that this method might simultaneously result
in separation of low- and high-density subdomains of
plasma membrane, thereby providing a complemen-

tary method for detergent-free isolation of membrane
rafts. initially, we used cell surface biotinylation to
track the plasma membrane proteins during the fractionation. consistent with previous reports (27), in the
absence of cell surface biotinylation, streptavidin overlay assays revealed the presence of a small number of
endogenously biotinylated proteins in ␣t3-1 whole cell
lysates (fig. 5a). after cell surface biotinylation and
separation of cell homogenates into cytosolic and total
membrane fractions, streptavidin overlay assays revealed the majority of biotinylation within the membrane fraction, verifying the cell impermeability of the
biotinylation reagent and validating this assay for
tracking of bulk plasma membrane during fractionation (fig. 5a). discontinuous sucrose density gradient
fractionation of ␣t3-1 cell postnuclear supernatants
after cell surface biotinylation revealed that the majority of plasma membrane localized to the high-density
fraction (35–40% sucrose interface, fig. 5b). microsomal suspensions retrieved from the middle fraction of
the sucrose gradient (25–35% sucrose interface) were
enriched in the early endosomal marker eea-1 (fig.
5c). however, both the  xxxg931xxx  and the lipid raft
marker flotillin-1 partitioned exclusively into this middle fraction, indicating that this technique allows effective separation of low-density subdomains of
plasma membrane. both the erks as well as g␣q/11
associated with the lower-density middle fraction in a
manner unaffected by gnrha treatment (fig. 5c). after gnrha treatment, phosphorylated erk was similarly detected in the lower-density middle fraction. immunoreactivity for the proteins examined was
undetectable in the low-density upper fraction (data
not shown).
both the association of  xxxg1366xxx  with low-density
membrane domains as well as erk inducibility
by gnrha are susceptible to perturbation of
cellular cholesterol levels
analysis of lipid behavior in model membranes indicates that lo domain formation is highly dependent
upon cholesterol (28). cholesterol is also understood
to be critically important in the formation of membrane
raft domains in living cells (29). we previously reported
that, in ␣t3-1 cells, depletion of cellular cholesterol led
to a dissociation of the  xxxg931xxx  from a detergentresistant, low-density membrane environment as well
as a reversible uncoupling of the ability of gnrh to
activate the erk pathway (21). to further define the
importance of cholesterol-dependent membrane organization for the function of this signaling pathway,
we used a depletion/repletion strategy to define the
kinetics of recovery of gnrh-induced erk activation
after cholesterol perturbation. exposure of cells to
methyl-␤-cyclodextrin (cd) for 40 min resulted in a
complete loss of both the  xxxg931xxx  and the erks from
drms (fig. 6a). however, the association of the membrane raft marker flotillin-1 with drms was unaffected,
indicating that cholesterol depletion did not promote

reassociation of both the  xxxg931xxx  and erks with

even mild elevation of total cellular cholesterol, erk
inducibility by gnrh was not restored for up to 3 h
(fig. 6b). moreover, exposure of ␣t3-1 cells to cdchol alone led to an approximately 3-fold increase in
cellular cholesterol levels and caused a block in erk
activation by gnrh that developed with highly similar
kinetics (data not shown). these results suggest that
cholesterol homeostasis is critical for normal signaling
through the  xxxg931xxx  and implicate a complex process
of dynamic membrane (re-)organization as an important regulatory feature in the functional reestablishment of the erk pathway after perturbation of cholesterol homeostasis in cell membranes.

our experimental results to date suggest the possibility that erk activation after  xxxg931xxx  occupancy may
be initiated through the interaction of several signaling
intermediates (g␣q/11, c-raf, erks) that are compartmentalized in proximity to the  xxxg931xxx  through association with low-density plasma membrane microdomains. however, our data do not rule out the
possibility that cofractionation of multiple signaling
proteins in this pathway represents the isolation of a
complex, mixed population of subcellular membrane
compartments. for example, many components of the
erk pathway have been shown in other systems to be
assembled in association with endosomal membranes

fractions. fractions along with nonbiotinylated whole-cell lysate were subjected to sds-page and analyzed by streptavidin
overlay. molecular masses (mw) are indicated in kilodaltons. b and c, cells were homogenized in a detergent-free buffer, and
the postnuclear supernatant was subjected to discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation (40.6, 35, 25, and 5%).
microsomal suspensions were collected from the upper (u), middle (m), and lower (l) interfaces of the gradient, and the
membranes were repelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g. membrane pellets were electrophoresed and analyzed by
streptavidin overlay (b) and immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins (c).

through interactions with specific scaffolds and adaptors (30, 31). to further determine whether the  xxxg931xxx 
and erks associate with a common membrane environment within the raft compartment, we immunoprecipitated the  xxxg931xxx  from low-density membrane suspensions and examined the immunoprecipitates for
the presence of erks. erks coimmunoprecipitated
with the  xxxg931xxx  from drms (fig. 7, a and b), as well
as from microsomal suspensions prepared in the absence of detergent (fig. 7c). the reciprocal immunoprecipitations targeting  xxxg1366xxx  followed by immunoblot
analysis for the  xxxg931xxx  were uninformative due to a
high level of nonspecific signal arising from the heavy
chain of the anti- xxxg1366xxx  primary antibody.
 xxxg931xxx  associates with low-density membrane
domains in whole mouse pituitary and
coimmunoprecipitates with  xxxg1366xxx  in mouse
pituitary homogenates
our data from ␣t3-1 cells strongly implicate low-density membrane microdomains in the regulation of erk
activation by gnrh. to determine whether these domains may play a similar role in the organization of this
signaling pathway in differentiated gonadotropes in
vivo, we examined drms from homogenates of whole
mouse pituitaries. the  xxxg931xxx  partitioned into lowdensity drms in a manner similar to that observed in
␣t3-1 cells (fig. 8a). flotillin-1 was present exclusively

in the low-density fractions, whereas transferrin receptor was detected only in the high-density solubilized
fractions (data not shown). erks were also detectable
in low-density fractions from pituitary homogenates
(fig. 8a). whole pituitary represents a diversity of cell
types in which erks are ubiquitously expressed; thus
the presence of erks within low-density fractions of
pituitary homogenates does not provide evidence for
cell type specificity regarding the association of erks
with low-density membranes. to further determine
whether erks associate with a low-density membrane
compartment in gonadotropes, we immunoprecipitated the  xxxg931xxx  from drms of pituitary homogenates
and examined the precipitates for the presence of
erks. consistent with our observations in ␣t3-1 cells,
erks coimmunprecipitated with the  xxxg931xxx , indicating that these proteins associate with a common
membrane environment in vivo (fig. 8b).

discussion
subcellular compartmentalization of signaling proteins
is now recognized as a mechanism by which signaling
activity may be temporally and spatially regulated
within the cell, or by which the activation of a given
signaling pathway may be linked to a diversity of biological outcomes (32–34). this has become particu-

larly evident in the area of g protein-coupled receptor
(gpcr) signaling. whereas early studies of gpcr
function focused on the role of activated g protein
␣-subunits in the generation of diffusible second messengers and modulation of ion conductances, current
models emphasize the spatial segregation and trafficking of cell surface receptors among discrete subdomains of the plasma membrane, as well as the
ability of internalized gpcrs to couple to diverse intracellular signaling cascades, including the erk module of the mapk system (35). consistent with these
themes, we previously demonstrated that, unlike other
gpcrs, the  xxxg931xxx  partitions constitutively and exclusively into membrane rafts, and that this raft association was required for the ability of this gpcr to
couple to the erk pathway in the ␣t3-1 gonadotrope
cell line (21). the results described here expand upon

immunoblot using an antibody against  xxxg1366xxx . b,  xxxg931xxx  was

nonimmune serum (nrs), or beads alone (beads). whole-cell
lysate (wcl, 1 ␮g, lane 1), 5% of the input for each input (ip,

these earlier findings and show that the  xxxg931xxx  partitions into low-density membrane domains in whole
mouse pituitary as well in ␣t3-1 cells. these results
further support the use of this cell line as a model of
 xxxg931xxx  behavior in pituitary gonadotropes and suggest that compartmentalization of the  xxxg931xxx  into
low-density membrane microdomains is of functional
significance in vivo.
after ligand activation, most gpcrs are rapidly
phosphorylated, desensitized, and targeted for clathrin-mediated endocytosis through association with
␤-arrestins (36). arrestins have also been shown to
provide an important link between many gpcrs and
the erk pathway by nucleating specific signaling
complexes on the surface of receptor-laden early en-

a, whole mouse pituitaries were homogenized in the presence of 0.1% triton x-100 and subjected to discontinuous
sucrose density gradient centrifugation. fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and aliquots of each
fraction were analyzed by immunoblot using anti- xxxg931xxx

dosomes (37–39). however, the  xxxg931xxx  is not phosphorylated after ligand binding and does not associate
with arrestins (40). furthermore, the delayed kinetics
of  xxxg931xxx  internalization suggest that gnrh-induced
erk activation occurs independently of receptor internalization (41). previously, we proposed a model in
which coupling of the  xxxg931xxx  to the erk pathway
involves, at least in part, the assembly of a raft-associated signaling complex consisting minimally of the
 xxxg931xxx , g␣q, and c-raf (21). our present confocal
imaging data show that the vast majority of the  xxxg931xxx  population localizes to gm1-enriched regions of
the plasma membrane in ␣t3-1 cells. furthermore, we
show that the  xxxg931xxx  and erks coimmunoprecipitate
from low-density membrane fractions both in ␣t3-1
cells as well as whole mouse pituitary. these data
demonstrate a close physical proximity between the
 xxxg931xxx  and erks at the level of the plasma membrane and provide further support for our model of a
specific plasma membrane-associated signaling complex as a link between the  xxxg931xxx  and the erk pathway in gonadotropes.
in these studies, the behavior of the erks with
respect to their association with low-density membrane domains was similar to our previous observations of c-raf (21). both c-raf and the erks partitioned
constitutively and partially into low-density membrane
fractions, both in ␣t3-1 cells and in whole mouse
pituitary. in addition, these kinases were rapidly activated within this membrane compartment after gn-

rha stimulation (21). the small proportion of total
cellular erks that partitioned into the low-density
membrane compartment may reflect the overall small
size of this compartment, or may indicate a relative
paucity of erk docking sites within this compartment,
dictated perhaps by the specific architecture of raftassociated complexes. also, because signaling complexes are characterized by low-affinity interactions, it
is possible that dissociation and loss of some of these
complexes from low-density membranes during homogenization and fractionation led to an underestimation of the proportion of erks that reside within this
compartment in intact cells. like c-raf, the association
of erks with membrane rafts in resting cells was
completely disrupted by homogenization of cells in
higher concentrations of the nonionic detergent triton
x-100. importantly, however, stimulation with gnrha
rescued the raft-association of erks after exposure of
cells to higher detergent concentrations. the biophysical basis for this increased resistance to detergent
solubilization is unclear; however, the apparent increase in affinity of both c-raf and erks for the lowdensity membrane compartment that is induced by
gnrh argues that modulation of this membrane affinity is a specific biological effect of  xxxg931xxx  activation.
finally, unlike c-raf, association of erks with lowdensity membranes was susceptible to cholesterol depletion and was restored after cholesterol replenishment, in a manner that paralleled the  xxxg931xxx .
interestingly, erks do not possess a defined lipidbinding domain, and, to our knowledge, have not been
shown to interact directly with membranes (42). loss
of erks from the low-density membrane compartment under conditions of cholesterol depletion likely
reflects the cholesterol dependence of an intermediate, membrane-associated adapter protein(s). our
analysis of the kinetics of recovery of erk inducibility
after cholesterol depletion and repletion indicated that
normalization of total cellular cholesterol levels and
restoration of the raft association of the  xxxg931xxx  and
erks are not sufficient for reconstitution of signaling.
this temporal lag in recovery of signaling is consistent
with a requirement for reorganization of a raft-associated multiprotein signaling complex.
although numerous methods for the study of membrane rafts have been reported, the most commonly
used method for their isolation remains extraction of
cells with low concentrations of a nonionic detergent,
followed by fractionation of the cell homogenate by
density gradient centrifugation. however, studies of
model membranes have raised concerns regarding the
ability of nonionic detergents to promote the formation
of a cholesterol-dependent lo phase (24, 43). to address these concerns, our previous work analyzed
drms, as well as membrane fractions prepared using
a detergent-free, carbonate-based method, to demonstrate association of the  xxxg931xxx  with low-density
membranes (21). here we report the use of an additional complementary technique for fractionation of
subcellular membranes in the absence of detergent.

this method was originally used for isolation of microsomal suspensions enriched in early endosomes.
huber and colleagues (30) have shown that early endosomes are largely separable from plasma membrane on the basis of differential buoyant density
alone. because membrane rafts are distinguishable
from bulk plasma membrane by their lower buoyant
density, as well as their detergent resistance, we reasoned that this technique might allow separation of
membrane rafts from bulk plasma membrane in the
absence of detergent. indeed, our results with this
method show that both the  xxxg931xxx  and the membrane
raft marker flotillin-1 partitioned into a low-density microsomal fraction that is enriched in early endosomes.
using cell-surface biotinylation to track the plasma
membrane during the fractionation, our data indicate
that the majority of plasma membrane partitions into a
higher density fraction, consistent with the notion that
the membrane raft domains occupied by  xxxg931xxx  constitute a small proportion of the total plasma membrane in these cells. interestingly, membrane-associated erks showed a preference for the lower-density
fraction. because this low-density fraction represents
a mixed population of endosomal and plasma membrane elements, we cannot exclude the possibility that
a significant proportion of the erks that partitioned
into this fraction were associated with endosomes.
indeed, assembly of signaling complexes on endosomes is a prominent feature of the organization of the
erk pathway (30, 44). however, our ability to coimmunoprecipitate the  xxxg931xxx  and erks from this fraction indicates that at least some of the erks within this
compartment are associated specifically with gnrhrenriched plasma membrane rafts. the appearance of
phosphorylated erk within this fraction after gnrha
treatment further supports this conclusion. overall,
these data corroborate our analyses of drms and lend
further support to our model of a raft-based  xxxg931xxx 
signaling platform.
whereas our data provide evidence for the association of erks with plasma membrane rafts in gonadotropes, the functions and substrates of this membrane-associated erk are unknown. in most cell
types, including gonadotropes, a substantial portion of
activated erk undergoes nuclear translocation after
activation; indeed, phosphorylation of nuclear substrates involved in transcriptional regulation is often
considered the predominant endpoint of pathway activation. however, erks have also been shown to
target a variety of extranuclear substrates including
cytoskeletal regulatory proteins and cytoskeletal elements, proteins involved in intracellular membrane
trafficking, proteosomal subunits, and translational
regulators (45–47). although the functional link between the erk pathway and the activity of many of
these substrates has not been thoroughly defined, a
recent report indicated that the erks play a key role in
the gnrh-induced up-regulation of lh␤ mrna translation in l␤t2 cells through phosphorylation of specific
elongation initiation factors (48). as a further example

bliss et al. •  xxxg1366xxx  and  xxxg931xxx  in membrane rafts

of the complex and multifunctional organization of this
pathway, it has been shown that mitogen-induced
activation and nuclear translocation of the erk substrate  xxxg1987xxx  are preceded by its transient translocation to the plasma membrane via a mechanism that
involves erk interaction but is independent of erk
phosphotransferase activity (49). this raises the interesting possibility that, in addition to their prominent
role as kinases, activated erk proteins may serve
adaptor roles under certain circumstances. given the
small proportion of total cellular erk that resides
within the raft compartment in our studies, it seems
unlikely that the totality of erk activation that occurs
within these cells takes place within the context of the
raft-associated  xxxg931xxx  signaling platform proposed in
our model. however, we are intrigued by the possibility that raft-associated erks play a role in the cellular
response to gnrh by targeting a specific subcellular
complement of substrates. determination of the functional importance of raft-associated erks in gonadotropes will require identification of the molecular determinants required for association of these proteins
with membrane rafts, as well as the composition of the
protein complexes that form within this compartment.

confocal microscopy

␣t3-1 cells grown on glass-bottom microwell dishes were
transiently transfected with a  xxxg931xxx  construct with a gfp
fluorophore linked to the c terminus for 48 h. after 48 h of
transfection, gm1 domains were labeled with alexa fluor 594
ctxb at 4 c. anti-ctxb antibody was then used to cross-link
the ctxb-labeled domains. cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then imaged.
imaging was done utilizing the 63⫻ oil objective and the
488-nm and 543-nm laser lines of a zeiss lsm 510 meta
confocal microscope (carl zeiss, inc., thornwood, ny). the
alexa594 and gfp signals were acquired using multitrack
mode, and no cross talk between alexa594 and gfp was
observed. transferrin receptor colocalization with gm1 was
assessed in ␣t3-1 cells using the same alexa fluor 594 ctxb
staining approach described above. after gm1 labeling,
␣t3-1 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at
room temperature. cells were blocked in pbs containing 3%
bsa and then incubated with antitransferrin antibody overnight at 4 c. the following day, cells were washed and
labeled with a alexa fluor 488-conjugated antimouse secondary antibody for 1 h. cells were then imaged by confocal
laser scanning microscopy as above. quantitative analysis of
fluorophore colocalization is expressed as a scatter diagram
(50). identical images (colocalization) produce a clean diagonal line running from the bottom left to the top right. differences between the images cause an irregular distribution in
the scatter diagram.
tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry
male mice were anesthetized with ketamine and transcardially perfused with 100 ml 1% sodium nitrite in 0.9% nacl,
followed by 200 ml of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde; 15%
saturated picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer; ph 7.4) and
then 100 ml cryoprotectant (20% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate
buffer). pituitaries were removed and stored in cryoprotectant
overnight at 4 c. tissue was embedded in tissue-tech oct
compound and frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen-cooled
isopentane. sections (20 ␮m) were mounted on silanecoated slides and stored at ⫺80 c.
sections were washed (all washes 3 ⫻ 3 min in 0.01 m pbs)
and incubated (48 h) in a solution containing a rabbit antignrhr antibody (1:2000; 10% goat serum, 0.3% triton in
pbs) as well as a horse antiovine lh antibody (1:5000).
sections were washed and immersed in biotinylated goat
antirabbit igg and goat antihorse igg linked to texas red (90
min; both at 1:200). after additional washing, sections were
immersed in fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin (90 min;
1:200), washed, mounted, and examined by conventional
immunofluorescence microscopy.
cell surface biotinylation
cell surface biotinylation was performed using a commercial
kit (molecular probes/invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) with minor
modifications. biotin-xx-sulfosuccinimidyl ester was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml
and then diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 ␮g/ml in pbs.
␣t3-1 cells were serum starved in dmem for 2 h and then
placed on ice. cells were washed twice with cold pbs and
then incubated on ice for 15 min in 1 ml of biotin-xx-sulfosuccinimidyl ester in pbs per 12 cm2 of culture dish surface
area. cells were then washed twice in cold pbs before
collection.

suspension (representing 10% of the total input) was reserved. the remaining suspension was incubated on ice for
10 min, homogenized in a glass dounce, and centrifuged for
10 min at 3000 rpm. the postnuclear supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 ⫻ g at 4 c for 30 min. the
resulting supernatant and pellet (representing cytosolic and
total membrane fractions, respectively), as well as the input
were boiled in sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) load buffer.
detergent-resistant, low-density membrane fractions were
prepared essentially as described previously (21). briefly,
␣t3-1 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 15-cm2
dishes. after the treatments indicated, cells (⬃1.5 ⫻ 108 per

with protease inhibitors. cells were pelleted by centrifugation
and then resuspended in 2-[n-morpholino]ethanesulfonic
acid buffer (mbs) containing 25 mm mes (ph 6.5), 130 mm
nacl, and protease inhibitors to a final volume of 400 ␮l. the
samples were adjusted to the indicated concentration of
triton x-100 and incubated on ice for 10 min. after dounce
homogenization (20 strokes), the samples were mixed with an
equal volume of 90% sucrose, placed in a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with a discontinuous gradient of
sucrose in mbs consisting of 35% (3.7 ml) and 5% (500 ␮l)

sw50.1 rotor for 20 h at 4 c. low-density detergent resistant
membranes were visible as a band of flocculent material at
the 35–5% interface. fractions (500 ␮l) were collected starting from the top of the gradient.
detergent-free fractionations were performed as described previously (26) with minor modifications. ␣t3-1 cells
(⬃4 ⫻ 108 cells) were washed and scraped into pbs as
described above. cells were pelleted by centrifugation and
washed once in 5 ml cold hb. cell pellets were resuspended
in 2.2 ml hb containing 50 ␮g/ml cycloheximide, and gently
homogenized in a glass dounce (eight strokes). nuclei and
unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and 2 ml of
the postnuclear supernatant was collected and mixed with
2.4 ml of hb-sucrose containing 62% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole (ph 7.4), 2 mm edta, and protease inhibitors to achieve
a final sucrose concentration in the sample of 40.6%. the
homogenate was transferred to a 13-ml ultracentrifuge tube
and overlaid with a discontinuous gradient of hb-sucrose
consisting of 35% (4 ml), 25% (3 ml), and hb (600 ␮l).
samples were centrifuged in a sw41 rotor at 35,000 rpm, 4
c for 1 h. translucent bands of material visible at each
interface were collected, diluted 4-fold in cold pbs, and
repelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g for 30 min at 4 c.
pellets were resuspended in sds loading buffer and boiled.
female b6/129 mice (8–20 wk of age) were euthanized by
co2 asphyxiation. pituitaries were collected and placed in
dmem containing 10% fetal bovine serum on ice. pituitaries
were washed once in cold pbs and once in cold mbs and
homogenized as described above. animal use and experimental protocols for these studies were approved by the
cornell university institutional animal care and use committee. for whole pituitary fractionations, pituitaries (n ⫽ 20)
were resuspended in 400 ␮l cold mbs containing 0.1% triton
x-100, homogenized in a glass dounce (20 strokes), and
subjected to discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation as

determined by bradford assay. protein samples were boiled
for 5 min in sds loading buffer, resolved by sds-page, and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting. membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry
milk in tbst (10 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5; 150 mm nacl; 0.05%
tween 20) and then incubated with primary and hrp-conjugated secondary antibodies. for streptavidin overlay assays,
blots were blocked as described and then incubated at room
temperature for 1 h in a 1:10,000 dilution of streptavidin-hrp
in tbst. protein bands were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s instructions (perkinelmer, boston, ma).
cholesterol depletion and repletion

␣t3-1 cells were cultured in 6-cm2 dishes to 70–80% confluence. after serum starvation for 2 h, cells were incubated
in dmem or dmem containing 2% cd for the indicated times.
for cholesterol repletion, cd-containing media were exchanged for dmem containing 0.5 mg/ml cholesterol in the
form of cholesterol-loaded cd for the indicated times. total
cellular cholesterol was measured from 2-␮l aliquots of clarified radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysate using a commercial kit (amplex red, molecular probes/invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
immunoprecipitation
aliquots (400 ␮l) of fractions containing suspensions of lowdensity membranes, or sucrose alone, were diluted in an
equal volume of pbs and adjusted to 0.01% triton x-100.
anti- xxxg931xxx  immune serum (is, 25 ␮l), nonimmune rabbit
serum (nrs, 25 ␮l), or vehicle (pbs, 25 ␮l), were added, and
the samples were rocked for 4 h at 4 c. protein a/g agarose
beads (30 ␮l) were added, and the samples were rocked an
additional hour at 4 c. beads were then washed three times
in pbs with 0.01% triton x-100, resuspended in 60 ␮l of sds
loading buffer, and boiled.
statistical analysis
data on cholesterol concentration were analyzed using a
one-way anova with a bonferroni post hoc multiple comparisons test. significance for each pair-wise comparison
was determined at p ⱕ 0.01.
