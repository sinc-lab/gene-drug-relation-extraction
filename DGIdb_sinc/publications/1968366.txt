we investigated the effects of f%- ( xxxd3017xxx  2x50 jig/day for 9 days) and b1- (xamoterol
2 x200 mg/day for 14 days) adrenoceptor agonists on lymphocyte f%-adrenoceptor density and
pl- and .82-adrenoceptor in vivo function (assessed as  xxxd2398xxx -infusion-evoked hemodynamic effects and exercise-induced tachycardia) in healthy volunteers.  xxxd3017xxx  decreased
lymphocyte a2-adrenoceptor density and all f2-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects but did
not affect ,l1-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects. in contrast, xamoterol neither affected
lymphocyte f2-adrenoceptors nor f%-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects but decreased
j3-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects. it is concluded that in humans, generally long-term
application of 81- or 32-adrenoceptor agonists causes desensitization of /1-adrenoceptor
function but in a ,-adrenoceptor subtype-selective fashion. (circulation 1990;81:914-921)

c ell culture and animal studies have convincingly demonstrated that /3-adrenoceptors can
be dynamically regulated by a wide variety of
drugs, hormones, and physiological and pathological
conditions (for reviews, see references 1-3). circulating lymphocytes are frequently used to study such
alterations of fl-adrenoceptor function in humans
because they contain a homogeneous population of
,b2-adrenoceptors that couple to stimulation of adenylate cyclase (for reviews, see references 4-6). prolonged treatment with ,b-adrenergic drugs has similar
effects on lymphocytes of healthy volunteers and
patients and on ,32-adrenoceptor-containing animal
tissues: nonselective and ,82-selective agonists
decrease, and antagonists without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (e.g., propranolol) increase the number of functional 832-adrenoceptors.2,4-6 moreover, the

number of lymphocyte ,(2-adrenoceptors can be significantly correlated with that in solid human tissues
containing predominantly 832-adrenoceptors, such as
myometrium7 and lung.8 on the other hand, changes
in lymphocyte (32-adrenoceptor number induced by
long-term treatment with different 13-adrenoceptor
antagonists in patients undergoing coronary artery
bypass grafting are significantly correlated with
changes of ,82-adrenoceptors in the corresponding
right atrial membranes but not at all related to
changes in right atrial f,-adrenoceptors.9 thus, lymphocytes appear to be a suitable model in which to
study agonist- and antagonist-induced regulation of
,/2-adrenoceptor number in other human tissues but
may not adequately reflect /31-adrenoceptor changes.
little is known of the relation between alterations
of lymphocyte p32-adrenoceptors (as measured by
radioligand binding) and changes in i1- and 12adrenoceptor-mediated physiological effects in
humans. therefore, we compared the effects of treatment with subtype-selective agonists on lymphocyte
/32-adrenoceptors with that on various f1- or /2adrenoceptor-mediated physiological effects. the j82adrenoceptor-mediated effects were  xxxd2398xxx 
infusion-induced decreases in diastolic blood pressure, increase in plasma noradrenaline, and increase
in lymphocyte f32-adrenoceptor number and responsiveness'0-14; the 131-adrenoceptor-mediated effects
were dynamic exercise-induced tachycardia and iso-

acceleration of heart rate was assessed as a mixed f,land i.2-adrenoceptor-mediated effect.'0-12,14 these
parameters were first investigated before and after 9
days' oral treatment with the highly ,82-selective agonist procaterol1516 in a placebo-controlled, doubleblind study. because this study showed that  xxxd3017xxx 
subtype-selectively decreased lymphocyte 132adrenoceptor function as well as all ,32-adrenoceptormediated physiological effects but did not affect 31adrenoceptor-mediated effects, we then studied the
effects of the 13,-selective agonist xamoterol17,18 in a
second group of healthy subjects.
methods
twenty male healthy volunteers aged 25.2±1.1
years (range, 20-28 years; blood pressure, 122.3 +4.4/
76.2+2.3 mm hg; heart rate, 66.5±4.0 beats/min)
participated in the studies after having given
informed written consent. all subjects were drug free
and had undergone physical examination to exclude
asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac disease, and other symptoms referable to the cardiovascular system; they
were of average physical fitness, and none exercised
regularly.
the study protocols are given in figure 1. in the
 xxxd3017xxx  study, the volunteers performed exercise
(day 1) and  xxxd2398xxx -infusion tests (day 2)
before treatment began; immediately after the  xxxd2398xxx  infusion, they were given either placebo
or  xxxd3017xxx  (2x50 ,ug/day orally  xxxd2274xxx :00 am and
7:00 pm) for 9 days. on days 9 and 10, the exercise
and  xxxd2398xxx -infusion tests were repeated.
thereafter, treatment was changed (placebo into
 xxxd3017xxx  and  xxxd3017xxx  into placebo), and on day
17 and 18, when the volunteers were still on treatment, the exercise and  xxxd2398xxx -infusion tests
were repeated. the last drug intake was on day 18
 xxxd2274xxx :00 am. lymphocyte /82-adrenoceptor density
was determined on days 1 and 2 (predrug values), 5
(i.e., 3 days after first intake of  xxxd3017xxx  or
placebo), 10 and 13 (i.e., 3 days after drug change),
18 (i.e., last day of drug intake), and 21 (i.e., 3 days
after cessation of drug treatment).
in the xamoterol study, the volunteers also performed the exercise and  xxxd2398xxx -infusion tests
on days 1 and 2, respectively; immediately after the

 xxxd2398xxx  infusion, they were given xamoterol
(2x200 mg/day  xxxd2274xxx :00 am and 7:00 pm) for 14 days.
the last drug intake was on day 16  xxxd2274xxx :00 pm, and the
exercise and  xxxd2398xxx -infusion tests were
repeated on the mornings of days 16 and 17. lymphocyte p32-adrenoceptor density was determined on
days 1 and 2 (predrug values), 6, 9, and 13 (i.e.,
during drug intake), 17 (i.e., 12 hours after last drug
intake), and 20 (3 days after cessation of drug
treatment). in both studies, the volunteers measured
heart rate themselves during the whole treatment
period (daily at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm after 30 minutes
of rest in a sitting position).
the exercise test was always performed in the
supine position on a bicycle (bosch, berlin, frg)
after 1 hour of rest between 8:00 and 10:00 am in a
quiet air-conditioned room; the subjects started with
an initial work load of 50 w, which was increased by
25 w every 3 minutes until a maximum work load of
150 w was reached (total exercising time, 15 minutes). blood pressure and heart rate were recorded
automatically by a tonomed (speidel & keller, jungingen, frg) and an electrocardiogram, as recently

described.'0
the  xxxd2398xxx -infusion test was also performed
between 8:00 and 10:00 am after 1 hour of rest in the
supine position. we infused  xxxd2398xxx  in doses of
either 3.5, 7, 17.5, and 35 ng/kg/min for 5 minutes
each ( xxxd3017xxx  study) or 3.5, 7, 17.5, 35, and 70
ng/kg/min for 5 minutes each (xamoterol study).
blood pressure and heart rate were recorded automatically by a tonomed and by an electrocardiogram. immediately before the infusion and after each
 xxxd2398xxx  dose, 15 ml ice-cold edta blood was
withdrawn for determination of plasma catecholamines. in addition, immediately before and after the
infusion, 30 ml heparinized blood were taken for
assessment of lymphocyte f32-adrenoceptor density.
details of the procedure have been described.10
lymphocyte 3,2-adrenoceptor density was assessed
by icyp binding at six to eight concentrations ranging from 10 to 150 pm; nonspecific binding was
defined as binding in the presence of 1 ,um of the
hydrophilic ,3-adrenoceptor antagonist (±+)-cgp

described previously.19
human right atrial appendages were obtained
from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting (new york heart association functional
class i or ii - no significant heart failure) after having
given informed written consent; right atrial membranes were prepared as recently described.9 human
lung tissue was taken during thoracotomy from
patients undergoing surgery because of bronchial
carcinoma; the tissue samples were macroscopically
normal, and no tumor cells could be identified in a
histological examination. human lung membranes
were prepared essentially as described recently for
rat lung membranes.20 for determination of the
affinities of xamoterol and  xxxd3017xxx  to human cardiac f31-adrenoceptors and human lung and lymphocyte 1,2-adrenoceptors, right atrial membranes (in the
presence of 55 nm ici 118,551, to yield a homogeneous population of ,31-adrenoceptors), lung membranes (in the presence of 300 nm cgp 20712a, to
yield a homogeneous population of ,l2-adrenoceptors),
and lymphocyte membranes were incubated with
icyp (40-55 pm) for 60 minutes at 370 c in the
presence or absence of 21 concentrations of xamoterol
or  xxxd3017xxx , and specific binding was determined as
described above. present throughout the experiments
was 10 ,um gpp(nh)p. the resulting competition
curves were analyzed by the iterative curve-fitting
program ligand.21 statistical analysis was performed
using the f-ratio test to measure the goodness of fit of
the competition curves for either one or two sites.
plasma catecholamines were assessed by a highperformance liquid chromatographic method with
electrochemical detection.
the experimental data given in the text and figures
are expressed as mean±sem of n experiments. the
maximal number of binding sites (bm.,) and the
equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) for icyp
binding were calculated from plots according to
scatchard.22 the significance of differences was estimated by a paired two-tailed t test; a p-value of less
than 0.05 was considered significant.

affinity of  xxxd3017xxx  and xamoterol to human
,f3- and [32-adrenoceptors
we first determined the affinity of  xxxd3017xxx  and
xamoterol for human f31- and 82-adrenoceptors by

lymphocyte

inhibition of icyp binding to human right atrial,
lung, and lymphocyte membranes. these experiments
were performed in the presence of 10 ,um gpp(nh)p
(to prevent binding to the agonist high-affinity state of
the p-adrenoceptor); ici 118,551 (55 nm) was added
to the atrial and cgp 20712a (300 nm) to the lung
membranes to yield homogeneous populations of i3land ,82-adrenoceptors, respectively. under these conditions,  xxxd3017xxx  and xamoterol inhibited icyp
binding with monophasic competition curves indicating interaction with a single class of ,3-adrenoceptors.
the resulting k, values demonstrate that  xxxd3017xxx 
had an about 100-fold higher affinity for human 182than 831-adrenoceptors (table 1), whereas xamoterol
had an about 40-fold higher affinity for 13k- than

32-adrenoceptors (table 1).

effects of  xxxd3017xxx  treatment
treatment with  xxxd3017xxx  (2 x 50 ,ug/day) decreased lymphocyte 832-adrenoceptor density and 10
,.m  xxxd2398xxx -evoked camp increases by about
30% after 3 days and by about 35% after 9 days
(figure 2). three days after withdrawal of  xxxd3017xxx , either at the end of the study or after change
to placebo treatment, 3,2-adrenoceptor density and
 xxxd2398xxx -evoked camp increase were not significantly different from predrug values. placebo, on the
other hand, had no significant effect on lymphocyte

3,2-adrenoceptor density or 10 gm isoprenalineevoked camp increase (figure 2).
 xxxd3017xxx  treatment increased heart rate by 10-15
beats/min after 12-24 hours. during further treatment, heart rate declined slowly and reached predrug
levels about 2-3 days after withdrawal of  xxxd3017xxx .
placebo, on the other hand, had no significant effect
on heart rate (figure 2).
 xxxd2398xxx  infusion increased lymphocyte /32adrenoceptor density from 1,107±+94 to 2,017±199
icyp binding sites per cell (n = 10) and 10 ,um
 xxxd2398xxx -evoked in vitro increase in camp content from 8.2±1.2 to 14.9+1.8 pmol camp/106 cells
(n=10). placebo treatment had no significant effect
on this increase (data not shown), whereas after 9
days of  xxxd3017xxx  treatment, the isoprenalineinduced rise in lymphocyte 132-adrenoceptor density
(from 736±66 to 1,147±123 icyp binding sites per
cell) and 10 ,tm  xxxd2398xxx -evoked in vitro
increase in camp content (from 5.6+1.0 to 8.1+1.3
pmol camp/106 cells) were markedly attenuated.

xamoterol had no effect on the  xxxd2398xxx  infusion-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure
(figure 7b), but the dose-response curve for the
systolic blood pressure increasing effect of  xxxd2398xxx  was significantly shifted to the right to higher
doses after 14 days of xamoterol treatment (figure

in contrast to the  xxxd3017xxx  treatment (figure

significantly reduced after 14 days of xamoterol
treatment (figure 8b); in addition, the  xxxd2398xxx 
infusion-induced rise in heart rate was also diminished, at least at the higher  xxxd2398xxx  doses (35

discussion
long-term administration of 132-adrenoceptor agonists significantly decreases the number of functional
/32-adrenoceptors on circulating white blood cells in
healthy volunteers as well in asthmatic patients (for
recent reviews, see references 1, 2, 4-6), but to our
knowledge nothing is known on the effects of longterm administration of 813-adrenoceptor agonists on
these 132-adrenoceptors. our data demonstrate that
oral treatment of healthy volunteers with the selective
,82-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd3017xxx  decreases lymphocyte 132-adrenoceptor density by about 35% and similarly mitigates the lymphocyte camp response to
 xxxd2398xxx  stimulation in vitro; on the other hand, a
2-week treatment with the selective 131-adrenoceptor
agonist xamoterol did not significantly affect lymphocyte 132-adrenoceptor function.
we observed a similar subtype-selective pattern of
,b-adrenoceptor desensitization for the physiological
effects: the dose-response curves for the isoprenalineinduced decrease in diastolic blood pressure, increase
in plasma noradrenaline levels, and lymphocyte 132-

curve for the  xxxd2398xxx -induced increase in heart
rate (a mixed [cardiac] 81- and 32-adrenoceptormediated effect; see references 10-12, 14) was significantly shifted to the right to higher doses by
treatment with xamoterol and  xxxd3017xxx  but not
affected by placebo; the rightward shift, however, was
less pronounced than that for the pure 81- and 12adrenoceptor-mediated effects. these data support
the view that the doses of xamoterol and  xxxd3017xxx 
used in this study act selectively at f31- and 12adrenoceptors, respectively.
thus, the  xxxd3017xxx -induced desensitization of
lymphocyte 132-adrenoceptor function (as determined
by biochemical methods) was accompanied by a
similar desensitization of f82-adrenoceptor-mediated
physiological effects (as determined by physiological
methods). on the other hand, xamoterol desensitized
physiological effects mediated via p,b-adrenoceptors
but not those mediated via 132-adrenoceptors and did
not downregulate lymphocyte 132-adrenoceptors.
these data are in good agreement with our recent
observations that long-term treatment with different
,3-adrenoceptor antagonists subtype selectively regulates 131- and 132-adrenoceptors in right atria and
p32-adrenoceptors in lymphocytes9 and saphenous
veins23 of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting: 831-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists such
as metoprolol, atenolol, or bisoprolol increased right
atrial /,3-adrenoceptor density but did not affect right
atrial, lymphocyte, or saphenous vein 832-adrenoceptor density. on the other hand, the nonselective
/3-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and sotalol
increased both 131- and 182-adrenoceptor density in
right atria as well as 132-adrenoceptor density in
lymphocytes and saphenous veins. from these
results, we conclude that lymphocyte /32-adrenoceptors are a good model to study (long-term) regulation of /32-adrenoceptor function in humans,
whereas /,3-adrenoceptor function is only poorly
reflected by this model, if at all.
it should be emphasized, however, that the interpretation of our data has some limitations. first, we
cannot exclude the possibility that the isoprenalineinduced tachycardia is partly caused by reflex withdrawal of vagal tone in response to vasodilation.
however, the overall contribution of vagal withdrawal to the  xxxd2398xxx -induced acceleration of
heart rate seems to be not very important because
vagal activity increases during  xxxd2398xxx  infusion24
and prevention of the blood pressure reduction by
simultaneous infusion of  xxxg99xxx  does not alter
 xxxd2398xxx -induced tachycardia.25 second, it might
be possible that the  xxxd2398xxx -induced rise in
systolic blood pressure is partly mediated by 132adrenoceptor-stimulated noradrenaline release (figure 5) with resultant increase in vascular resistance
via a-adrenoceptor activation. although we cannot
exclude this possibility, it seems quite unlikely
because the  xxxd2398xxx -induced increase in systolic
blood pressure is markedly diminuted by the 13lselective antagonist bisoprolol (given in a 13,-selective

dose) but not by the highly selective 132-antagonist ici
118,551 (given in a 132-selective dose; reference 10).
third, xamoterol is only a partial p,b-agonist,17 and
the reduction in 813-adrenoceptor-mediated physiological effects could be secondary to its ,3-blocking
activity. however, agonist and antagonist activity of
partial agonists depend on basal sympathetic activity;
when sympathetic activity is low, the agonistic effects
dominate and the antagonistic effects become apparent only at a higher sympathetic drive. as our study
was performed in healthy volunteers without any
signs of abnormal sympathetic activity and xamoterol
elevated resting heart rate, it is quite likely that the
effects of xamoterol are caused by its agonistic
effects, although a contribution of antagonistic

effects cannot be ruled out completely.
our observations of a systemic but subtypeselective desensitization of /3-adrenoceptor function
after long-term administration of ,3-adrenergic agonists may be of clinical importance for the /2adrenergic bronchodilator therapy in asthmatic
patients or for the /31-adrenergic inotropic therapy of
patients with congestive heart failure. lymphocyte
,32-adrenoceptor density is consistently decreased in
asthmatic patients treated with j32-adrenoceptor
agonists.1,24-6 a similar desensitization of lymphocyte 132-adrenoceptors is found in pregnant women
treated with /82-adrenergic agonists to prevent preterm labor; in these patients, the number of myometrial 83-adrenoceptors (consisting of 85% 82- and 15%
131-adrenoceptors) is also reduced, and lymphocyte
and myometrial ,b-adrenoceptor density are significantly correlated.7 these results favor the idea that
the decreased density of lymphocyte 32-adrenoceptors observed in asthmatic patients treated with
132-adrenergic bronchodilators might reflect a similar
reduction of f32-adrenoceptors in bronchial smooth
muscle (and in mast cells). according to the present
results, it is very likely that 813-adrenergic agonists may
cause a similar decrease in /1-adrenoceptor density;
however, such a reduction in /31-adrenoceptors cannot
be monitored in lymphocytes because lymphocyte
p2-adrenoceptors are subtype-selectively regulated
only by agonists with a reasonably high affinity for
182-adrenoceptors (see above). it is still a matter of
controversy whether a reduced ,b-adrenoceptor density might diminish the efficacy of /8-adrenergic agonist
treatment as results supporting as well as contradicting the occurrence of tachyphylaxis to 832-adrenergic
therapy in asthmatic patients26-29 or 31-adrenergic
therapy in patients with chronic heart failure30-34 have
been reported. the present results, however, clearly
suggest that a tachyphylaxis to (31- and (82-adrenergic
agonist treatment can develop (at least in healthy
volunteers); this should be taken into consideration
when chronically treating patients with congestive
heart failure with 813-adrenoceptor agonists or asthmatic patients with 132-adrenoceptor agonists.
