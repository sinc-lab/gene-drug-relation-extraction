abstract
the expression of the human m-opiate receptor (mor1) in post mortem human brain tissue was examined using real-time
pcr technology. tissue samples from 11 fatalities due to opiate overdose and five normal subjects with different causes of death
were analysed in order to elucidate whether chronic opiate abuse is followed by a regulation of mor1 expression. in each case
nine selected brain regions (thalamus, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmentum, hippocampus, amygdala, frontal
cortex, nucleus accumbens, putamen) were evaluated. the mor1-mrna level was determined relative to the housekeeping
gene b2-microglobulin. while in most regions the mor mrna levels in the brain of addicts were not different from the control
group—with varying levels between 0 and 15% of housekeeping gene level—in the brains of three drug-related fatalities an
enormous increase was encountered in the thalamus where the mor-mrna level amounted for up to 10,000% of the measured
housekeeping gene level. the results obtained by toxicological hair analysis in the group of drug-related fatalities indicate that
the enormous thalamic mor1-expression is primarily found in individuals who died from acute heroin overdose but did not
show signs of a substantial chronic administration of the drug. further studies have to be performed to evaluate if the observed
mor1-mrna up-regulation in the thalamus in a subpopulation of acute lethal intoxications mirrors a state of functional
hypersensitivity associated with the occurrence of death.

1. introduction
the m-opiate receptor (mor1) is the primary site of
action for morphine and the most commonly used opioids
[1,2]. in transgenic mor1-deficient mice the lack of the
mor1 receptor leads to a complete loss of the main
biological effects of morphine, like analgesia, reward,
dependence and withdrawal [3]. the mor1-receptor
expression pattern in animal and human brain has intensively
been studied. autoradiographic methods [4,5] and immunohistochemical procedures [6,7] have been used to map the
anatomical distribution of the binding sites, respectively the
receptor protein. after cloning of the receptor in 1994, insitu hybridisation studies provided a tool to localize the
corresponding mrna [4,8].

the opiate receptors belong to the superfamily of
g-protein coupled receptors which exert their biological
actions via activation of  xxxd2247xxx  (gtp)binding protein and a variety of additional effectors like
adenylyl cyclase or ion channels [9]. by examination of
postmortem brain specimen of heroin addicts who had died
from opiate overdose, adaptive changes were found on many
levels of the intracellular signal transduction pathway,
including an increased density of  xxxd2245xxx  nucleotide-binding
protein [10,11] and decreased levels of caþþ-dependent
protein kinase c [11,12].
in cell culture and in animal experiment, chronic morphine exposure has additionally been observed to be followed by changes in mor number as well [13–19]. in the
frontal cortex, thalamus and caudate of postmortem brains of
human heroin addicts, however, radio ligand binding studies
[20] and immunoblotting using a polyclonal antiserum
against the amino-terminal portion of the rat mor [11]
failed to demonstrate comparable regulative changes in or

number. on the contrary, by means of immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against the mor, an upregulation of immunolabelled neuronal profiles was shown
in the area 11 of the frontal cortex of drug related fatalities,
as compared with controls [21].
cloning of the mor not only allowed to determine the
anatomical localization of the receptor mrna but also
provided experimental techniques to elucidate whether the
neuroadaptive processes occurring during chronic morphine
treatment involve concurrent changes in the steady-state
levels of the transcripts. the cell culture [22] and animal
experiments [23,24] performed up to now showed unaltered
mrna levels after chronic morphine exposure suggesting
that adaptive changes at the level of gene expression do not
account for regulatory processes induced by chronic morphine exposure.
this is the first time that the mor1-mrna is analysed in
distinct nuclei of the human brain using a new and sensitive
technology that allows the quantitative mrna-analysis in
small tissue samples. in general, a quantitative analysis of
post-mortem tissue samples is based on rna stability. the
stability of total mrnas in human post-mortem brain tissue
has been shown in several studies [25–27].
recently, comparison of the relative mrna levels using
human cortical brain biopsies and autopsies with different
post-mortem intervals revealed unchanged relative expression levels for most genes after adjusting with constitutively
expressed reference genes (housekeeping genes) [28]. this
observation indicates that quantitative rna-based gene
expression studies should reveal the relative in vivo mrna
level of genes even if samples of varying post-mortem times
have to be analysed [28].
here, a reverse transcription/real-time pcr-assay was
established to quantify the mrna levels of the human
mor relative to the housekeeping gene b2-microglobulin.
additionally, intensive toxicological analysis—using
blood and hair samples, if available—was performed in
order to characterize drug concentrations and history at time
of death of the addicts included in the study.
the comparison of the levels found in nine selected brain
areas of control cases with the concentration in postmortem
brain tissue of fatalities due to opiate overdose is expected to
contribute to the understanding of the neurobiological
mechanisms underlying opiate tolerance and dependence
as well as of the pathophysiological concept of lethal opiate
intoxication.

2. material and methods
2.1. material
the material studied consisted of brain specimens
obtained at autopsy from 11 humans died due to opiate
overdose (9 males, 2 females, 18–44 years old, post-mortem
delays from 12–96 h). the examined brain regions included

frontal cortex (fc) and grey matter, thalamus (t), hypothalamus (hyp), hippocampus (hip), amygdaloid complex
(ca), caudate nucleus (nc), putamen (put), nucleus accumbens (nac) and the ventral tegmental area (vt). in the drugrelated fatalities, the blood unconjugated morphine levels
ranged from 52 to 335 ng/ml, the total morphine concentration from 131 to 514 ng/ml. the blood alcohol analysis
revealed positive findings in four cases ranging from 0.21
through 2.4 mg/kg. according to the results of the toxicological examination the causes of death were not heroin/
morphine monointoxications, but combined intoxications
with further drugs (of abuse) in every case. the additional
drugs included benzodiazepines (6), other drugs with
central nervous actions (3), cannabinoids (5), cocaine,
respectively, benzoylecgonine (4), methadone (3) and
(designer) amphetamines (1). in 11 cases, appropriate hair
specimen could be obtained to perform additional toxicological analyses monitoring the long-time uptake of drugs.
in four of these fatalities 6-monoacetyl-morphine was found
(0.1–0.28 ng/mg), in one case additionally 0.93 ng/mg
morphine and 0.14 ng/mg cocaine. in those cases showing
increased mor1-mrna levels in the thalamus the hair
analysis revealed negative results.
the control group comprised four males and one female,
28–59 years old, with comparable post mortem delays. the
individuals who were included into the study had no history
of drug abuse and at the time of death had not been under
the influence of opiate drugs as revealed by postmortem
toxicological analysis. the causes of death were hanging (2),
myocardial infarction (1), carbon monoxide poisoning (1)
and undetermined.
2.2. methods
2.2.1. toxicological examination
various body fluids and organ tissues were assayed for
therapeutic drugs, drugs of abuse (acidic, basic and neutral
organic drugs) and ethanol using routine methods including
immunochemical procedures and liquid-liquid as well as
solid-phase extraction procedures with further analysis by
thin layer chromatography (tlc) and gas chromatography–
mass spectrometry (gc–ms) or high performance liquid
chromatography with diode array detection (hplc/dad).
for a quantitative determination of opiates a solid-phase
extraction procedure was used directly and after enzymatic
hydrolysis of blood samples followed by a gc–ms analysis
of the silyl derivatives in the selected ion monitoring mode
(sim). deuterated analogues were used as internal standards. for quantification peak area ratios of the analytes to
the deuterated internal standards were calculated as a function of the concentration of the substances. for further detail
see [7].
toxicological examination of hair was performed in
addition to monitor the long-time abuse of drugs. for
this purpose, hair samples were washed for 5 min in
5 ml of deionised water, petroleum benzine and finally

dichloromethane using a vortex genie 2 mixer (bender &
hobein ag, zurich, switzerland). after drying they were cut
into small pieces of about 1 mm. the washing solutions were
analyzed by gc–ms procedures to exclude external contamination. for extraction 50–100 mg of the hair sample,
3 ml of methanol and 50 ml of each deuterated internal
standard (5 mg/ml) were ultrasonicated for 5 h. after evaporation under nitrogen, the residue was dissolved in 3 ml of
phosphate buffer (ph 6). the further steps (spe, derivatization, quantitative determination) were carried out exactly
according to the procedure described in detail for the blood
sample [7].
2.2.2. analysis of human post-mortem brain tissue
2.2.2.1. rna extraction/cdna synthesis. from each human
brain studied, brain specimens from nine different areas
were dissected during autopsy, including the area 11 of the
frontal cortex (according to brodmann) (fc), the caudate
nucleus (nc), putamen (put), nucleus accumbens (nac),
thalamus (t), hypothalamus (hyp), amygdaloid complex
(ca), hippocampus (hip) and the ventral tegmental area
(vt). tissue samples of 0.5–1 g were immediately frozen in
dry ice and stored at 80 8c. frozen tissue samples were
homogenised (miccra d-8, art-modern labtechnique,
müllheim, germany), in 2 ml trizol reagent (trifast,
peqlab, erlangen, germany) and total rna was extracted
following the manufacturer’s protocol. after ethanol
precipitation the vacuum dried rna was dissolved in
200 ml depc-water and the quantity of rna was
determined by absorbance at 240 nm (1od260 ¼ 43 mg/
ml for rna).
dna was removed by dnase i (boehringer mannheim,
germany) treatment followed by column-purification
(rneasy, qiagen, hilden, germany). two microliters of
the purified rna solution and 2 ml from each of five
rna standards with known concentrations were given onto
a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. rna was
visualised by uv illumination and finally concentrations
were estimated by comparison to standard rna.
for cdna synthesis 200–500 ng total rna was mixed
with 100 pmol hexamer primers (life technologies, erlangen, germany), filled up with depc-water to a final volume
of 12 ml and incubated for 10 min at 65 8c. after cooling on
ice 8 ml of rt-mastermix (omniscript, qiagen, hilden,
germany) were added and cdna synthesis was performed

for 60 min at 42 8c and terminated by incubating for 10 min
at 75 8c.
2.2.2.2. quantitative pcr/amplification settings. real-time
pcr was carried out with the lightcycler1 instrument
(roche molecular biochemicals, mannheim, germany)
using the dna binding dye sybr green i for the
detection of pcr products.
mor1 and b2-microglobulin products were generated by
separate pcr reactions using the primers shown in table 1.
for each amplification 0.5 ml cdnawere used in a 10 ml-pcr
reaction mix including 4 mm mgcl2, 5 pmol each primer and
1 ml master mix (faststart dna master sybr green i,
roche molecular biochemicals). the thermal profile of
the lightcycler was optimised with an initial denaturation
of 10 min at 95 8c (hotstart) and 40 amplification cycles with
each 15 s at 95 8c, 5 s at 588 and 10 s at 72 8c.
2.2.2.3. data analysis /validation. pcr data were analysed
using the lightcycler1 software (version 3.4). a relative
quantification was performed using a serial dilution of cdna
(concentrate, 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) as external standard in
each experiment. standard curves were generated by the fit
point method of the lightcycler1 software. the relative
amounts of mor1-mrna were calculated for each sample
by expressing the mor1-mrna level as a percentage of b2microglobulin mrna levels, that were determined from
separate pcr reactions of aliquots of cdna for different
brain regions from each case.
the reproducibility of the method was determined in
independent pcr reactions performed on different days
using aliquots of the same cdna as template. the mean
 standard deviation (s.d.) value and the coefficient of
variation are given as indicator of precision and reproducibility. the reproducibility of single results was determined
with two strategies: (a) two-time measurements of cdna
aliquots; (b) analysis of two different cdnas prepared from
the same rna extract.

data are given as ratios (%) of mor1 mrna to b2-microglobulin mrna. results of ‘‘0%’’: no mor1 amplification in the presence of successful amplification
of b2-microglobulin. results marked as ‘‘–‘‘: no cdna available/analysis could not be performed.

in specific areas of the human central nervous system. brain
specimen from nine discrete regions of 16 human brains
were prepared at autopsy for rna isolation and cdna
synthesis (see table 2).
average rna yield ranged from 5–20 mg rna per
100 mg brain tissue. the rna amount differed between
individuals and brain regions but no correlation between post
mortem interval and amounts of extracted rna could be
observed, in particular no time-dependent decrease. this
finding confirmed the high rna stability even if post
mortem delays up to 96 h are given. furthermore, no brain
region specific differences concerning the rna amount
were encountered.
3.2. pcr amplification/primer design
from both templates (mor1 and b2-microglobulin
cdna) pcr amplifications were performed using cdna
specific primers that anneal to sequences in exons on both
sides of an intron, so that amplification of contaminating
genomic dna was excluded. while the primers for the
amplification of the b2-microglobulin transcript were
already published [29], different sets of primers (not shown)
were tested to optimise the mor1 cdna amplification so
that the pcr for the receptor and the housekeeping gene
showed high and similar pcr efficiencies (fig. 1a and b).
in all cases the slope of the standard regression ranged from
3.1 to 3.7 indicating maximal pcr amplification efficiency (fig. 1c and d).
the specificity of all pcr reactions was tested under
normal pcr conditions in a thermocycler (triblock, biometra) prior to lightcycler1 quantification. with the optimised primers (table 1) a single dna band with expected

molecular size was observed for both mor1 (230 bp pcrfragment) and b2-microglobulin (147 bp pcr-fragment).
pcr products were analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining (data not shown).
3.3. real-time pcr/validation
quantitative pcr was performed using sybr green.
this fluorescent dye binds to all double-stranded dna
molecules. it therefore labels not only specific pcr products
but also non-specific products and primer-dimers, which
leads to inaccurate quantification. to avoid this problem
the faststart kit (roche biochemicals, mannheim) was
used which enables a hot start, where a chemically modified
taq dna polymerase is completely inactive at room temperature but fully reactive by a 10-min incubation at 95 8c.
using the pcr primers shown in table 1 we could completely avoid primer dimerisation.
for every sample an amplification plot was generated (as
example: fig. 1e), showing the increase in the sybr green
dye fluorescence with each cycle of pcr. to correlate initial
template concentration to real-time fluorescence curves the
‘‘fit points’’ analysis method of the lightcycler1 software
was applied in order to reach the most efficient counting.
from each specimen, the generated cdna was used to
amplify the receptor and the housekeeping gene template
in separate pcr reactions. the quotient of both results
(mor1 calculation/beta2-microglobulin calculation) was
calculated correcting differences in the amounts of rna
used for cdna synthesis.
the mor1-mrna levels (table 2) in most of the analysed brain regions did not differ between cases and controls
with highest levels of mor1 mrna transcripts found in the

thalamus and nucleus accumbens. in the brain of some drugrelated fatalities (btm 2, 3, 6, 7, 11) increased levels of
mor1 mrna were encountered in the ventral tegmental
area, the nucleus accumbens and the putamen. in three of
these addicts, in the thalamus data ranged between 1000 and
12,000% of the measured housekeeping gene level. comparing the increase of mor1 mrna in the thalamus
between cases and controls by wilcoxon’s rank-sum-test
revealed no statistically significant difference (p ¼ 0:44).
similarly, comparing 3 out of 11 cases versus 0 out of 5
controls with an increase above 1000% in the thalamus
region was not significant (p ¼ 0:51, fisher’s exact test).
the enormously increased concentrations of mor1
mrna in the thalamus of three addicts were controlled
by two-fold measurement of one cdna and additionally by
using two different cdnas from the same rna extract,
synthesised during independent rt reactions. for samples
that were analysed in at least two different runs the median
was given in table 2 (in italics data).
the inter-assay variation was determined using data from
the analysis of the cdna standard that was included in each
experiment. therefore, data from eight independent lightcycler1 experiments were chosen and the concentrations of
the standard cdna in the 1:10 dilution (0.1) were calculated
with the second derivaty maximum program instead of the fit
point program (both lightcycler1 software) so that the
specific crossing points and the concentrations are measured
automatically. in eight independent experiments the 1:10
dilution of the standard cdna was calculated with
0:1167  0:0079 (mean  standard deviation) and a coefficient of variation of 6.8338 %. these data demonstrate the
high accuracy and reproducibility of the method.
altogether the reproducibility of single results was determined with differences <15% and therefore correlates with
the reproducibility obtained in other lightcycler1 studies.

4. discussion
sensitive methods for the detection and analysis of mrna
transcripts expressed only in low concentrations provide an
important tool in molecular biology studies. real-time pcr
assays allow a direct measurement of successful gene specific
amplification after each pcr cycle. the method is based on
fluorescent energy transfer measurement. in the present
study, the dna binding dye sybr green i was used that
binds to the minor groove of dsdna. increasing amounts of
pcr product are followed by an increasing dye binding and
the enhancement of fluorescence signal intensity.
the quantification is based on the measurement of concentration in the log-linear phase of an unknown sample
relative to an external standard. the external standard is
homologous to the sample but amplified in separate capillaries during the same lightcycler1 experiment. the standards were used to create a standard curve. a relative
quantification assay was established, where the results of

the template (mor1) amplification are normalised against
housekeeping gene (beta2-microglobulin) data obtained by
separate amplifications of cdna aliquots in the same run.
a combined technique is described, in which reverse
transcription (rt) is coupled with quantitative pcr amplification of the resulting cdna. this sensitive technique
could be optimised in order to quantify the mor1-mrna
level in post-mortem human brain specimen from fatalities
due to acute opiate intoxication in comparison with control
persons.
while full-length mrnas are vulnerable to degradation
and fragmentation with respect to long post-mortem intervals, amplification of short reverse transcribed rna fragments seems to be stable [27]. for this reason, in the present
study very short amplicons (<250 bp) were employed to
minimize the possible influence of degradation. furthermore, in this context should be emphasized that the present
study is not intended to determine the absolute concentration
of mor1 mrna in human brain tissue but to examine
whether there exist differences between drug-related fatalities and controls with comparable post mortem intervals. as
there is no reason to assume a different velocity of degradation in the two collectives, on the one hand it cannot be
excluded that post mortem changes might have altered the
absolute levels, but on the other hand the comparative
assessment is not impaired.
the observed expression pattern correlates with results
obtained by in-situ hybridisation studies of the rat brain,
witch showed high densities of mor1 mrna expressing
cells in the ventrolateral and ventromedial parts of thalamus
and moderate densities in the nucleus accumbens [4]. in
comparison, respective studies of the human brain [8]
revealed high density of neurons labelled for the mor1
and high grain density per labelled neuron in the nucl.
accumbens and most nuclear groups of the thalamus as well.
the lightcycler1 results obtained in the group of opiate
addicts were not different from the data of the control group
in most of the brain regions, indicating that chronic opiate
abuse does not affect the expression of the mor1 gene in
these areas. these results are in line with the findings of
chronic morphine exposure of ng 108-15 cells [22] and in
rat brain after chronic treatment with morphine [23,24]
which did not disclose any adaptive changes of the
mor1 mrna level following the drug treatment. the
conclusion was drawn that the neuroadaptive processes
occurring during chronic morphine treatment und underlying the development of analgesic tolerance did not involve
changes in the levels of mrna so that probable changes in
the number of receptors might result from altered mor
processing and/or degradation, including activation or
unmasking of silent receptors or a change in the lysosomal
degradation of functional receptors [23].
nevertheless, in the brain of some drug-related fatalities
increased levels of mor1 mrna were encountered in the
ventral tegmental area, the nucleus accumbens and the
putamen, regions functionally related to the mesolimbic

j. becker et al. / forensic science international 140 (2004) 13–20

dopaminergic reward system [30]. furthermore, in the thalamus of three drug-related fatalities an enormous increase
of the mrna-level was found. here the data raised up to
10,000% of the measured housekeeping gene level, exhibiting
a substantial ‘‘up-regulation’’ in single cases. these findings
are consistent with the results of a previous immunohistochemical study using a monoclonal antibody against the mor
which revealed an increase of immunolabelled neuronal
profiles in the area 11 of the frontal cortex of drug related
fatalities, as compared with controls [21]. due to the small
number of cases, one should be careful to draw general
conclusions. nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate about
probable explanations in comparison with data from animal
and cell culture experiments. reflections suggested briefly
include differences in the mode of administering the drug
[31,32], additional effects of ethanol [33] and the time interval
between opiate exposition and sampling the specimen for
examination of receptor mrna (for more detail see [21]).
furthermore, animal experiment findings suggest that
opiate receptor agonists may also produce biphasic effects
on receptor density with an initial up-regulation (within the
first minutes after treatment) succeeded by subsequent
down-regulation [15]. these early changes can only be
recorded when the binding studies are conducted immediately after cessation of the opiate treatment. this is the case
in the present study on post-mortem brain specimen of opiate
addicts who died of an acute intoxication because the light
cycler examination records the level of or mrna at the
time of death and under the acute influence of morphine. in
comparison, in mice who showed tolerance to the analgesic
opioid effects and mor down-regulation after continuous
infusion of  xxxd2070xxx  via osmotic minipumps, the evaluation
of mor mrna levels 16 h after cessation of the treatment
revealed a dose dependent increase in steady state transcript
levels [34]. this finding was considered as adaptive response
preceeding and driving the recovery of mor. this experimental result confirms that an up-regulation of receptor
mrna may occur prior to an increase of receptor protein.
the toxicological examination of hair in the present study
which mirrors a probable long term exposure indicates that
the deceased had not consumed relevant doses of morphine
over a longer period and probably had not yet developed
tolerance to the effects of the drug. taken together, the
findings of the present study may be consistent with the
hypothesis that death due to the intoxication occurred
because of the coincidence and interaction of the acute
morphine effect with receptor up-regulation. thus, the
encountered adaptive changes of mor mrna levels would
not be related to tolerance but to functional hypersensitivity
in the early stage of the intoxication.

5. conclusions
methods to isolate intact rnas from post mortem human
brain permits the analysis of gene expression and may help

19

to uncover the nature of the molecular signalling in neurological diseases. the examination of brain samples from
individuals who died due to opiate overdose is expected to
elucidate whether chronic opiate abuse is followed by a
regulation of mor expression and thus may contribute to the
understanding of phenomena like addiction, tolerance or
hypersensitivity. the results of the present study suggest that
a subpopulation of fatalities due to opiate overdose express
increased levels of mor1 mrna at the time of death which
probably reflect a receptor up-regulation consistent with a
functional state of hypersensitivity and the occurrence of
death. it has to be emphasized that the presented results and
conclusions have to be confirmed by examination of a larger
collective, in particular, because the enormous heterogeneity
in autopsy material necessitates the analysis of large numbers of samples to obtain statistically meaningful results.
nevertheless, the method established here will be useful
in further studies on steady state mrna-levels in the brains
of addicts, who died due to opiate overdose.
