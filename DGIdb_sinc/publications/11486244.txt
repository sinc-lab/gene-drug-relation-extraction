angiotensin  xxxg100xxx  antagonist irbesartan decreases lesion size, chemokine expression, and macrophage accumulation in  xxxg177xxx -deficie...  recent data suggest that  xxxg99xxx   xxxg100xxx  antagonists may be beneficial in the treatment of atherosclerosis. to clarify how  xxxg100xxx  antagonists reduce atherosclerosis, the effect of irbesartan on atherosclerotic lesion development was determined in low-fat, chow-fed apolipoprotein (apo) e-deficient mice. irbesartan (50 mg/kg per day) strongly decreased lesion development after a 12-week treatment period (lesion size: irbesartan treated, 20,524 +/- 4,200 microm(2) vs. control, 99,600 +/- 14,500; 79.4% inhibition, p < 0.001). this effect was not due to an effect of irbesartan on lipoprotein levels because irbesartan slightly increased total cholesterol levels and decreased the ratio of apo a-i relative to apo b levels. immunochemical analysis of the atherosclerotic lesions using the mac3 monoclonal antibody showed the presence of macrophages in the lesions of control mice, whereas sections from irbesartan-treated animals only showed occasional labeling in the lesion area. these data suggest that irbesartan inhibits monocyte/macrophage influx into the vessel wall. therefore, expression levels of  xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ), as well as other chemokines involved in macrophage infiltration into the lesion area, were measured in the aortic sinus of control and irbesartan-treated animals. irbesartan treatment strongly decreased  xxxg357xxx  mrna levels as well as  xxxg357xxx  immunostaining in the lesion area. this effect of irbesartan on  xxxg357xxx  occurred without an effect on  xxxg370xxx , the receptor of  xxxg357xxx . expression of macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha, another cc chemokine expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, was also reduced after irbesartan treatment, without effect on ccr3 and ccr5, the receptors of mip-1alpha. concomitantly, the expression of the angiogenic chemokines kc and mip-2, which are functionally related to  xxxg562xxx , were downregulated, whereas their shared receptor  xxxg564xxx  was upregulated. these data suggest that inhibition of the inflammatory component of lesion progression plays an important role in the inhibitory effect of  xxxg100xxx  antagonists on atherosclerotic lesion formation.
