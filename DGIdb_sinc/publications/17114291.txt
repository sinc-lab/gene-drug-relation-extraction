processing of the n-terminal initiator methionine is an essential
cellular process conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. the
enzymes that remove n-terminal methionine are known as methionine aminopeptidases (metaps). human  xxxg1400xxx  has been shown
to be required for the proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis. the physiological function of  xxxg1399xxx , however, has
remained elusive. in this report we demonstrate that a family of
inhibitors with a core structure of pyridine-2-carboxylic acid previously developed for the bacterial and yeast  xxxg1399xxx  is also
specific for human  xxxg1399xxx  (hsmetap1), as confirmed by both
enzymatic assay and high-resolution x-ray crystallography. treatment of tumor cell lines with the  xxxg1399xxx -specific inhibitors led to
an accumulation of cells in the g2兾m phase, suggesting that
hsmetap1 may play an important role in g2兾m phase transition.
overexpression of hsmetap1, but not hsmetap2, conferred resistance of cells to the inhibitors, and the inhibitors caused retention
of n-terminal methionine of a known metap substrate, suggesting
that hsmetap1 is the cellular target for the inhibitors. in addition,
when hsmetap1 was knocked down by gene-specific sirna, cells
exhibited slower progression during g2兾m phase, a phenotype
similar to cells treated with  xxxg1399xxx  inhibitors. importantly,
 xxxg1399xxx  inhibitors were able to induce apoptosis of leukemia cell
lines, presumably as a consequence of their interference with the
g2兾m phase checkpoint. together, these results suggest that
 xxxg1399xxx  plays an important role in g2兾m phase of the cell cycle and
that it may serve as a promising target for the discovery and
development of new anticancer agents.

rotein synthesis is initiated with a methionine residue in eukaryotic cells or a formylated methionine in prokaryotes,
mitochondria, and chloroplasts. for a large subset of proteins, the
initiator methionine is cotranslationally removed before further
posttranslational modification. the proteolytic removal of nterminal methionine is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as
methionine aminopeptidases (metaps). the functions of these
enzymes are evolutionally conserved and essential, as demonstrated
by the lethal phenotype of the map null mutant in bacteria.
although only one metap gene is present in the genome of most,
but not all, prokaryotes, at least two types of metaps, type i and
type ii, are known in eukaryotic cells. in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of either scmetap1 or scmetap2 resulted in a slow-growth phenotype compared with the wild-type
strain, whereas the double mutant is nonviable, indicating the
redundant yet essential functions of both types of metap (1, 2). in
multicellular organisms  xxxg1400xxx  has been shown to be essential for
the proliferation and development of specific tissues (3, 4).
human  xxxg1400xxx  has been identified as the primary target of the
 xxxd2166xxx  family of natural products that potently inhibit angiogenesis (5, 6). a synthetic analog of  xxxd2166xxx ,  xxxd1330xxx , with
higher potency and lower toxicity, has entered clinical trials for a
variety of cancers (7, 8). much evidence now exists supporting the

notion that hsmetap2 plays an important role in endothelial cell
proliferation and is likely to mediate inhibition of endothelial cells
by  xxxd2166xxx  and related analogs (5, 6, 9).
in contrast to hsmetap2, little is known about the physiological
function of human  xxxg1399xxx , although genetic studies in yeast have
suggested a more dominant role for scmetap1, as evidenced by the
more severe growth defect observed in scmetap1 knockout strain
than that in scmetap2 knockout strain (10). there has also been
circumstantial evidence implicating a role of hsmetap1 in tumor
cell proliferation. by using a proteomics-based approach, both
human metaps were identified as the binding targets of bengamides, a class of marine natural products that inhibit tumor growth
in vitro and in vivo (11). recently, pyridinyl pyrimidines have also
been identified as nonselective inhibitors for metaps, and inhibit
the proliferation of tumor cell lines (12). because most tumor cell
lines are refractory to the  xxxd2166xxx  family of hsmetap2 inhibitors
due likely to the defects in p53 pathway, the antiproliferative effects
of bengamides and pyridinyl pyrimidines could have arisen from
inhibition of hsmetap1. these studies suggested an important
function of  xxxg1399xxx  in human cell proliferation. despite all of the
previous studies, however, the physiological function of hsmetap1
has remained largely unknown.
we have taken two parallel approaches, chemical and genetic, to
assess the function of human  xxxg1399xxx  in cell proliferation. in the
chemical approach we attempted to identify small chemical compounds that selectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of hsmetap1
over hsmetap2. these compounds would then be used to assess
the consequence of inhibition of hsmetap1 on cell proliferation.
pyridine-2-carboxylic acid–amide derivatives, including compound
1, were previously reported to inhibit both the bacterial and yeast
 xxxg1399xxx  (13, 14). we found this class of compounds has ⬎100-fold
selectivity for hsmetap1 over hsmetap2. determination of the
x-ray crystal structure of hsmetap1 in complex with 1 helped to
confirm the interaction between 1 and the enzyme, in addition to
revealing a metal-dependent inhibitory mechanism. these compounds inhibited hsmetap1 in cells and blocked proliferation of
tumor cell lines. unlike  xxxd2166xxx , which arrests cell cycle at g1兾s
phase, compound 1 caused a significant cell cycle delay during
g2兾m phase. for the genetic approach, gene-specific silencing of
hsmetap1 also led to a delay in g2兾m phase cell cycle progression,
corroborating the observations with the specific chemical inhibitors
of hsmetap1. together, these findings suggested a pivotal role of

hsmetap1-specific inhibitors block proliferation of tumor cell lines.

it has been reported that pyridine-2-carboxylic acid–amide derivatives are inhibitory for escherichia coli metap (ecmetap) and
scmetap1 (13). analogs from the same class were synthesized and
tested against both human  xxxg1399xxx  and  xxxg1400xxx  (12) in the
presence of cobalt (ii) ions. as shown in table 1, lead compounds
were able to potently inhibit human  xxxg1399xxx  enzymatic activity
with ic50 values in the low micromolar range. however, none of
them inhibited hsmetap2 activity up to their solubility limits
(300–1,000 ␮m). because manganese (ii) has been suggested as the
physiological metal ion for hsmetap2 (15), we also tested these
analogs in the presence of manganese ion. hsmetap2 remained
unaffected by the highest concentrations of each compounds in the
presence of manganese ion (data not shown). taken together, these
results suggested that pyridine-2-carboxylic acid–amide derivatives
are highly specific for hsmetap1, rendering them useful molecular
probes to elucidate the cellular function of hsmetap1.
we next determined the effects of hsmetap1 inhibitors on cell
proliferation using a [3h]thymidine incorporation assay (12). both
hela and ht-1080 cells were inhibited with ic50 values in the low
micromolar range. there is a correlation between cellular inhibitory effects and hsmetap1 inhibition. it is noteworthy that compound 5, which is inactive against both hsmetap1 and hsmetap2,
also has no effect on the proliferations of either cell line.

pyridine-2-carboxylic acids inhibit  xxxg1399xxx  inside cells. although we

have shown that pyridine-2-carboxylic acid derivatives selectively
inhibit hsmetap1 in vitro and block cell proliferation in culture, the
causative relationship between these two effects remained to be
established. as the first step to assess this relationship, we determined whether pyridine-2-carboxylic acid derivatives are capable of
entering cells and inhibiting hsmetap1 activity in vivo by examining the n-terminal initiator methionine status of a known protein
substrate, 14-3-3␥ (11). hela cells were incubated with various
concentrations of compound 1 for 24 h before they were harvested
for western blot with a monoclonal antibody (clone hs23) specific
for the methionylated  xxxg2296xxx  of 14-3-3␥ protein (11).
as shown in fig. 1, treatment with 1 resulted in a dose-dependent
increase in the amounts of n-terminal methionine-containing
14-3-3␥ protein, compared with vehicle control, suggesting that 1 is
capable of inhibiting hsmetap1 activity inside cells.

acid derivatives is due to the inhibition of hsmetap1, it is expected
that overexpression of hsmetap1 should lead to a gain of resistance to the inhibitors. hela cells were thus transfected with
expression vectors for hsmetap1, or hsmetap2 as well as an
empty vector as control. overexpression of hsmetaps was confirmed by western blots (fig. 6, which is published as supporting
information on the pnas web site). the growth of hela cells was
not affected by different transfections. however, cells overexpressing hsmetap1 (⬇6-fold of control determined by western blot)
showed an ⬇5-fold decrease in the potency for compound 1 in
comparison to cells transfected with the vector (table 2). in
contrast, hela cells overexpressing hsmetap2 remained as sensitive to 1 as control cells, suggesting that hsmetap1 plays a unique
role in hela cell proliferation that could not be compensated for
by hsmetap2. when the same cells were treated with paclitaxel

known to target tubulin, which is mechanistically unrelated to
metap inhibitors, all three cell populations exhibited similar sensitivity (table 2), further supporting the notion that compound 1
inhibits cell growth by inhibiting the cellular  xxxg1399xxx  enzyme.
pyridine-2-carboxylic acids inhibit cell growth by delaying the cell
cycle progression through g2兾m phase. to understand the mecha-

nism of cell proliferation inhibition by hsmetap1 inhibitors, we
examined their effects on cell cycle progression using flow cytometry (16). unsynchronized hela cells treated with vehicle control
showed canonic distribution in g1, s, and g2兾m phases. however,
treatment with compound 1 led to a significant increase in cell
populations at the g2兾m phase (fig. 2a). when hela cells were
synchronized by double thymidine at g1兾s check point and released
in the presence or absence of compound 1, respectively, no difference was observed at the 6-h time point for these two populations
of cells (fig. 2b). however, 9–12 h after resumption of cell cycle,
hela cells treated with 1 exhibited a significantly slower progression through g2兾m phase, even though cells treated with 1 eventually were able to complete mitosis at 16 h after thymidine release
(data not shown).
in addition to 1, we also tested compounds 2 and 5, the active and
inactive inhibitors of hsmetap1, respectively. compound 2 is
capable of inhibiting hsmetap1 in hela cells as evidenced by the
increase in methionylated 14-3-3␥ protein, whereas 5 showed no
effect relative to the vehicle control (fig. 7, which is published as
supporting information on the pnas web site). when synchronized
hela cells were released from g1兾s check point upon double
thymidine blockade, cells treated with 2 advanced through g2兾m
phases more slowly than those treated with vehicle control. nonetheless, cells treated with the inactive analog 5 showed no difference
from control cells (fig. 7), indicating that the g2兾m phase delay
observed with compounds 1 and 2 was due to inhibition of
hsmetap1.

suggested that hsmetap1 may be essential for timely progression
through this phase of the cell cycle. to further verify this possibility,
we took a complementary approach using selective sirna duplexes
to down-regulate the expression of hsmetap1 and determined its
consequence on cell cycle progression. hela cells were transfected
with 100 nm sirna duplexes for either hsmetap1 or hsmetap2,
and the cellular protein levels were determined 48 h after
transfection by western blot analysis. as shown in fig. 2c,
hsmetap1- and hsmetap2-specific sirna duplexes were able to
down-regulate targeted proteins significantly in comparison with
scrambled-duplex control without interfering with the expression of
nontargeted metap or ␤-actin. in agreement with the downregulation of either hsmetap1 or hsmetap2 by their respective
sirnas, corresponding increases in methionylated 14-3-3␥ proteins
were observed, as expected (fig. 2c).
we next used these sirna duplexes to transfect hela cells 6 h
before the initiation of double thymidine synchronization of cell
cycle. cells were harvested at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h after the second
thymidine release, followed by cell cycle analysis with facs. as
shown in fig. 2d, all cells were synchronized on g1兾s checkpoint
at 0 h and launched their genome replication at the 4-h time point
with comparable speed. however, hsmetap1 sirna-treated cells
showed significant delay in progression through g2兾m phase at 8 h,
in comparison with cells transfected with scrambled or hsmetap2
sirna duplexes (fig. 2d). eventually, all of the cells were able to
complete mitosis for a new cycle of cell proliferation at the 12-h time
point. similar effects were observed in ht1080 cells during their
g2兾m phase progression (data not shown). thus, hsmetap1 is
required for the precise progression through g2兾m phase.

on jurkat t cells. as shown in fig. 4a, treatment of jurkat t cells
with compound 1 resulted in fragmentation of nucleosomal dna,
judged by dna ladder pattern, the hallmark of apoptosis. in
addition to dna laddering, we also examined the proteolytic
cleavages of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) and procaspase-3. treatment with compound 1 for 24 h resulted in a
dosage-dependent cleavage of parp protein. concurrently, the
full-length pro-caspase-3 decreased in a similar dose-dependent
fashion, complemented by the appearance of the active fragment of
caspase-3 (fig. 4b). similar results have been observed in a b cell
non-hodgkin’s lymphoma cell line (karpas 1106) (data not shown).
thus, by causing a delay in g2兾m phase, inhibitors of hsmetap1
are capable of inducing apoptosis among cancer cells, suggesting
that hsmetap1 may be a useful target for anticancer agents.

cyclin b is the universal cell cycle regulator implicated in the g2兾m
phase transition. exit from mitosis involves inactivation of cdk
kinase through cyclin b degradation (17). to understand the
molecular mechanism of hsmetap1-specific inhibition, we examined the protein levels of cyclin b1 and cdc2兾cdk1 kinase during
mitosis. when synchronized hela cells were released from thymidine arrest, cyclin b1 decreased dramatically between the 8-h and
10-h time points for vehicle control cells. however, cells treated
with 1 still have significant amount of cyclin b1 protein  xxxd1891xxx -h time
point (fig. 3a). cyclin b1 protein level eventually dropped at the
12-h time point (data not shown). interestingly, cdc2兾cdk1 protein
level did not change under compound 1 treatment (fig. 3a).
cyclin b1 protein expression is regulated at both transcriptional
and posttranscriptional levels. to dissect the regulatory mechanisms of cyclin b1 protein by hsmetap1 inhibition, we determined
the mrna level of cyclin b1 by rt-pcr. as shown in fig. 3b,
cyclin b1 mrna decreased during mitosis. neither compound 1,
the hsmetap1-specific inhibitor, nor  xxxd1330xxx , the hsmetap2specific inhibitor, altered the decrease of cyclin b1 mrna level
between 8 and 10 h. these results indicated that delayed degradation of cyclin b1 protein is likely to be regulated at the posttranscriptional level.

the basic pyridine carboxylic acid scaffold of the inhibitors. n1 and
n8 of the inhibitors and n␧2 of the his-212 form a part of the
octahedral coordination around the third cobalt ion with the other
three sites filled by water molecules. the thiazole ring of the
inhibitor is buried deep in the active site pocket surrounded by
several hydrophobic residues (pro-192, tyr-195, phe-198, and phe309) in addition to cys-203 (fig. 5b). n13 of the thiazole ring points
in the direction of the third metal center and forms a hydrogen bond
with one of the water molecules from its coordination sphere. this
hydrogen bond between the n13 and the water molecule locks the
only free rotatable dihedral angle (c12–n13–c14–s15) into a cis
conformation. the other two water molecules from the third metal
coordination center interact with the active site bridging water兾␮
hydroxo anion. in addition, each of these two water molecules
forms hydrogen bonds with active site residues (n␧2 of his-310 and
o␧2 of glu-336). based on modeling (data not shown), the sulfur
atom of the substrate methionine and the sulfur atom of the
inhibitor are placed within 1.2 å, with the latter farther from
catalytic center. the side chain containing the tert-butoxycarbonylamino group in 1 is in plane with the pyridine ring. because there
is a slight bend in the main scaffold in compound 1, the side chain
is offset from the position of the tert-butylcarbonylamino group in
2 (fig. 5b). the tert-butyl group in 2 is pointed into the hydrophobic
depression on the surface of the protein formed by tyr-195,
tyr-196, and trp-353. in compound 1 the tert-butyl group points
away from this depression and has only one methyl group pointed
toward tyr-196 with other two solvent-exposed. the tert-butyl
groups in both the molecules are separated by 2.3 å from each
other. there is no difference in the structure of the protein
molecules between the two complexes within the error of
the models except for a slight movement of the tyr-196 (o. . . o
distance 0.4 å).
discussion
small molecules have played an important part in the elucidation
of functions of genes. early examples include the use of the
immunosuppressant drugs  xxxd1781xxx  and fk506 to reveal
the important role of the protein phosphatase calcineurin mediating intracellular calcium signaling pathway (19). the application of another immunosuppressive natural product, rapamycin, has shed significant light on the tor kinases in myriad
signaling processes from cytokine signaling to nutrient sensing
(20). similarly, the identification of  xxxg1400xxx  as the cellular
target for the  xxxd2166xxx  family of antiangiogenic natural products has helped to reveal a unique function of this otherwise
universally expressed general-processing enzyme in endothelial
cells (5, 6) and t cells (21). however, in contrast to  xxxg1400xxx ,
study of the cellular functions of  xxxg1399xxx  has been hampered in
part by the lack of an inhibitor with sufficient selectivity.
following the identification of hsmetap2 as a target of  xxxd2166xxx  and  xxxd2800xxx , the metap family of enzymes has been under
increasing scrutiny as targets for developing antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. among the metap inhibitors reported,
the pyridine-2-carboxylic acid thiazole-2-ylamide class has emerged
as potent inhibitors of both e. coli and yeast  xxxg1399xxx . moreover,
members of this class of compounds have been subsequently shown
to inhibit recombinant hsmetap1 (14, 22). it remained unknown,
however, whether this family of  xxxg1399xxx  inhibitors also crossinteract with  xxxg1400xxx . we synthesized several analogs of this class
of inhibitors and determined their specificity for the two isoforms
of hsmetaps. gratifyingly, all compounds synthesized (1–4) exhibited exquisite specificity for hsmetap1, with ratios in ic50
values for the two enzymes ⬎200-fold, rendering these inhibitors
useful probes for the cellular function of hsmetap1 without the
complication of cross-inhibition on hsmetap2 at relatively low
concentrations.
the effects of hsmetap1 inhibitors on g2兾m phase transition
appear to be significant, yet different from those seen with other
18152 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0608389103

cytotoxic anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel or colchicine that
also inhibit cell cycle at the g2兾m phase. rather than a sustained
blockade of cells through the g2兾m phase, compound 1 and its
analogs caused a 3- to 4-h delay of cell cycle progression through
the g2兾m phase and allowed cells to eventually reach g1 phase
to resume another round of cell cycle. although this delay, not
blockade, in g2兾m phase by hsmetap1 inhibitors is plausibly
overcome by some cancer cell lines, it led to apoptosis of both
jurkat and karpas 1106 lymphoma cell lines. it is possible that,
in both jurkat and karpas 1106 lymphoma cell lines, the delay
in g2兾m phase progression by hsmetap1 inhibitors is not
compatible with the preexisting disruption of the g2兾m checkpoint control and causes cells to undergo apoptosis (23). as such,
hsmetap1 inhibitors represent a novel mechanistic class of
g2兾m phase inhibitors that may be useful for treatment of
cancer.
timely degradation of cyclin b protein is critical for exit from
mitosis during cell cycle progression (24). our results suggested that
inhibition of hsmetap1 regulates cyclin b protein level through a
posttranscriptional mechanism. the penultimate residue for cyclin
b protein is alanine, which qualifies cyclin b as a substrate for
metap; however, it remains unclear whether n-terminal methionine retention would directly account for the delayed degradation
of cyclin b protein. it is equally reasonable that the delayeddegradation effect on cyclin b protein is indirect, as a consequence
of the n-terminal methionine retention of another protein. our
further experiments have demonstrated that the lead compound is
capable of promoting cellular apoptosis by the activation of
caspase-3 and cleavage of parp protein. we therefore propose
that inhibition of hsmetap1 slows down cell cycle progression,
activates the g2兾m checkpoint, and eventually leads to apoptosis.
the high-resolution crystal structures of the complexes between
hsmetap1 and compounds 1 and 2 threw significant new light on
the highly specific molecular interaction between the enzyme and
the inhibitors. compounds 1 and 2 differ by only one oxygen atom.
the orientation of the tert-butyl group is different in both the
compounds with respect to the rest of the molecule. in 2 the
tert-butyl group points in a direction close to the scaffold, which we
refer it as a syn conformation, whereas in 1 it points away in a trans
conformation (fig. 5a). this directionality of the tert-butyl groups
seems to play an important role in the selectivity as suggested by the
biochemical data, both from our present study and from the results
of luo et al. (13). structural data suggest that the overall direction
of the tert-butyl group is away from the protein surface in the
ester-based side chain of 1 whereas it points into the hydrophobic
depression on the protein surface in the ketone-based compound 2.
compound 3 also follows the similar trend as 2 although it has
slightly lower affinity. it is possible that the aromatic side chain of
compound 3 forms ␲–␲ stacking interactions with either or both
aromatic rings of tyr-195 and tyr-196. the double bond in the side
chain of 4 probably imposes extra rigidity and limits the freedom of
orientation that is necessary for interaction with protein side chains,
thus explaining the lower affinity. in addition, it is also possible that
the two methyl groups in 4 may play a role in the lowering of affinity.
the compounds described here have 100- to 200-fold lower affinity
toward the type 2 human enzyme compared with that with type 1
enzyme (table 1). structure alignment of complexes of 1 and 2
hsmetap1 and the holo form of hsmetap2 (protein data bank
id code 1bn5) is demonstrated in fig. 5c. the side chain of
compound 2, which is close to the surface of the protein in the
hsmetap1 complex, seems to have a more severe steric clash with
the side chain of tyr-444 of the hsmetap2 compared with that of
the compound 1. such steric interactions provide the clue to the
difference in affinity of 1 and 2 toward hsmetap2. a similar
observation was made for pyridinylpyrimidine compounds described in our previous study (12). our in vitro enzymatic assay
suggested that pyridine-2-carboxylic acid derivatives are more selective inhibitors than pyridinylpyrimidines.

cell biology

sequence alignment of type 1 metaps suggests that tyr-195 and
trp-353, two of the three hydrophobic residues that form the
surface depression, are ⬇80% and ⬇98% conserved, respectively.
however, tyr-196 is only ⬇20% conserved and is replaced with a
variety of amino acids with histidine next in frequency (⬇18%).
note that tyr-196 is the only common residue that is in direct
contact with side chains of 1 and 2. together these data suggest that
one can design an organism-specific type 1 metap inhibitor that
does not inhibit the human type 2 metap. together, the structural
information on the two enzyme-inhibitor complexes should facilitate the design of more potent inhibitors of hsmetap1.
processing of the initiator methionine residue is an evolutionarily
conserved prerequisite step for different posttranslational protein
modifications, such as n-terminal acetylation (25), protein subcellular localizations (26), and protein half-lives (27). identification of
hsmetap1-specific inhibitors has shed light on the functions of
type i metap in mammalian cells. these small molecules could also
serve as lead compounds for the development of therapeutic
reagents. future applications of proteomics technology should
facilitate the identifications of downstream substrates for either
hsmetap1 or hsmetap2. such information will greatly assist in
elucidating the relationship between removal of the initiating
methionine and cell proliferations.
