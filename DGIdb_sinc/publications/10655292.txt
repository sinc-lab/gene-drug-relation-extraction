the feasibility of administering a relatively high dose of
the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (gnrh) antagonist
 xxxd2180xxx  by means of a needle-free injection device, which
could be useful in the long-term treatment of sex-steroiddependent disorders, was evaluated in a randomized, crossover study in 16 healthy females. local tolerance and
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2180xxx  administered by medijector® versus conventional needle injections were compared. additionally, the pharmacodynamic effect was
evaluated. two milligrams of  xxxd2180xxx  was administered
s.c. once daily for 7 days by medi-jector® or conventional
needle in a randomized sequence, without a washout period.
no apparent differences in local tolerance were observed.
most injections (87.5%) gave either no or only a mild
reaction. of the moderate reactions, swelling and redness
were reported most frequently (overall 4.9 and 8.5% per
injection, respectively). administration by medi-jector®
was bioequivalent to conventional needle injection with
respect to the peak concentration and area under the curve.
a profound suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle
stimulating hormone was observed. serum  xxxd2037xxx  and
progesterone concentrations were relatively low prior to
treatment and remained low during the entire study period.
in conclusion, administration of a relatively high dose of
 xxxd2180xxx  by medi-jector® might be useful for long-term
treatment of sex-steroid dependent disorders.

introduction
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (gnrh) agonists are commonly used in the treatment of several sex-steroid-dependent
disorders such as endometriosis and fibroids (conn and
crowley, 1994). upon repeated administration of these compounds, desensitization of the pituitary occurs, which results
in decreased gonadotrophin and sex steroid concentrations.
in contrast, gnrh antagonists like  xxxd2180xxx  act by competition with native gnrh for the  xxxg931xxx  binding site,
and result in rapid and dose-dependent suppression of gonadotrophins (duijkers et al., 1998). this mechanism of action
implies that  xxxd2180xxx  must occupy the receptor site continu© european society of human reproduction and embryology

ously in order to be efficacious. considering the elimination
half-life, this means that daily s.c. administration is required.
however, daily injections during a long period could be
experienced as a cumbersome procedure, which might compromise drug compliance. thus, felberbaum and colleagues
tested an i.m. depot preparation in patients with symptomatic
uterine fibroids, containing 60 mg of the gnrh antagonist
 xxxd466xxx  which needed to be given only once every 3 or 4
weeks (felberbaum et al., 1998). however, reliable pituitary
suppression could not be achieved during the whole dosing
interval. therefore, another option to improve patient convenience might be an easy-to-handle, needle-free administration
method for daily use with a relatively low dose.
for diabetic patients and patients with growth hormone
deficiency, the medi-jector® has become available for selfadministration of insulin (pehling and gerich, 1984) and
human growth hormone (verhagen et al., 1995; houdijk et al.,
1997). the medi-jector® is a needle-free injection device for
s.c. delivery of medication. under high pressure the injection
solution is forced through a fine nozzle, producing a microjet
that penetrates the skin. after penetration, the medication is
dispersed into the subcutaneous tissue, forming an injection
depot. overall, the injection causes a minimum of discomfort
for the patient. consequently, the medi-jector® might be a
useful device for self-administration in case of long-term
treatment.
since gnrh antagonists are known to be more prone to
histamine release from mast cells and consequently give
rise to more local reactions than gnrh agonists, further
examination is required whether dispersion of the  xxxd2180xxx 
solution after medi-jector injection causes an increased contact
with these mast cells and an increased incidence or severity
of local reactions. furthermore, it needs to be studied whether
dispersion alters the absorption rate.
thus, the current study was conducted to assess the
feasibility of  xxxd2180xxx  administration by medi-jector®, when
compared to conventional needle injections, based on local
tolerance and pharmacokinetics. additionally, the pharmacodynamic effect of a relatively high dose of  xxxd2180xxx  was
studied.
materials and methods
volunteers
a total of 16 healthy female volunteers between 19 and 31 years of
age were found eligible to participate and completed the study. their
average weight and body mass index (bmi) were 67.5 kg and 22.8
kg/m2 respectively. all women were in good physical condition
and were using oral contraceptives for at least 3 months. oral

contraceptives were used for contraceptive purposes only, not for
regulation of the menstrual cycle. subjects with a history or current
type i hypersensitivity (urticaria, eczema, hay fever, asthma) were
excluded from participation in the study. all subjects gave written
informed consent. the study was approved by the ethics committee
of the institution and was performed in accordance with the latest
revision of the declaration of helsinki.

resolved fluoro-immunoassays (delfia®, wallac oy, finland). the
detection limits for serum lh, fsh,  xxxd2037xxx  and progesterone were
0.6 iu/l, 1.0 iu/l, 13.6 pg/ml and 0.31 ng/ml respectively. the
coefficients of variation (cv) derived from analysis of quality control
samples for lh, fsh,  xxxd2037xxx , and progesterone ranged between
1.9 and 4.3%, 0.8 and 2.3%, 4.5 and 5.4%, and 2.3 and 6.0%
respectively.

study design
this study was an open-label, randomized, crossover study in 16
healthy female volunteers to assess and compare the local tolerance
and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2180xxx  (org 37462,  xxxd2180xxx ®, nv
organon, oss, the netherlands) after administration by means of a
medi-jector® (medi-ject corporation, minneapolis, usa) versus
conventional s.c. needle injection. in addition, the pharmacodynamic
effect of multiple doses of 2 mg  xxxd2180xxx  on endogenous hormone
concentrations [luteinizing hormone (lh), follicle stimulating hormone (fsh),  xxxd2037xxx , and progesterone] was investigated.
once the volunteers were screened and found eligible to participate
in the study, a comfort setting test with saline was performed to
determine the optimal pressure of the medi-jector® for accurate
drug administration. the volunteers discontinued the daily intake of
contraceptive pills exactly 1 week before the first drug injection and
were carefully instructed to use non-hormonal contraceptive methods
during the rest of the study period. after this pill-free period, they
received 2 mg  xxxd2180xxx  s.c. once daily during 7 days by medi-jector®
or by conventional needle injection in a randomized sequence. there
was no washout period between both treatments, as bioequivalence
of the two treatments was evaluated at steady state. all injections
were given in the upper leg, changing from the left to the right leg
on alternating days. in view of the fact that the training period to get
comfortable with the medi-jector® would be relatively long, compared
to the treatment duration, all injections were given by physicians who
were experienced in using the device. to enable frequent blood
sampling, the volunteers stayed at the clinical research unit from
treatment day 6 until day 8 after both administration methods.

calculations and statistical analysis
a total number of 16 subjects was required to obtain a power of 83%
at a significance level of 0.05, assuming a residual coefficient of
variation of 20% and a ratio test/reference of 1. in one participant,
the medi-jector® injection failed on days 6 and 7 of the first treatment
period. as it is unknown how much of the drug has penetrated the
skin after a failed injection, bioequivalence cannot be assessed.
therefore this subject was excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis. contrarily, for the evaluation of the feasibility of the device
with respect to local reactions and pharmacodynamics, results for
this subject were included.
for the local tolerance evaluation, frequency distributions per local
tolerance item were calculated by administration method.
for the pharmacokinetic evaluation, the mean steady-state trough
concentration (cmin, ss), the peak concentration (cmax) and the time
of its occurrence (tmax), and the area under the concentration-time
curve over one dosing interval (24 h) at steady state (auc0–24) were
determined or calculated.
bioequivalence testing was performed with the medi-jector®
administration as test treatment and the conventional needle injection
as reference treatment. for all parameters except tmax, point estimates
of the true ratio ‘test/reference’ with their 90% parametric confidence
intervals were derived from the analysis of variance (anova) (chen,
1992). for tmax, a point estimate of the difference between the test
and reference treatment with its 90% non-parametric confidence
interval was calculated using the method of hauschke (hauschke
et al. 1992). the bioequivalence range was predefined as 80–125%
relative to the reference range (chen, 1992) for all parameters except
tmax. for tmax, ⫾ 20% of the reference arithmetic mean was used as
acceptance range for the difference.
pharmacodynamic results were presented descriptively.

assessments
after completion of both treatment periods, the volunteer was
requested to indicate which injection method she preferred. local
tolerance was assessed 1 and 24 h after injection by scoring each
symptom (redness, swelling, bruising, pain and itching) as either
none, mild, moderate or severe. scoring of local tolerance items was
performed by the medical staff, with the exception of itching and
pain, which was scored by the subjects themselves. in addition, all
reported adverse events were documented. blood samples for the
assessment of serum  xxxd2180xxx  concentrations were collected before
each injection and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and
24 h after the injection on day 7 of both treatment periods. immediately
following collection, blood samples were processed to serum, and
stored at –20°c until analysis. additionally, all blood samples taken
before dosing and the 24 h sample after the last injection of the
second treatment period were assayed for lh, fsh,  xxxd2037xxx  and
progesterone.
assay
the method of  xxxd2180xxx  analysis in serum has been previously
described (nerenberg et al., 1993). calibration curves in the range
of 0.20 to 2.56 ng/ml were linear with correlation coefficients of at
least 0.99. the coefficient of variation (cv) derived from analysis of
quality control samples ranged between 4.1 and 9.9%. the lower
limit of quantification was 0.02 ng/ml. serum lh, fsh,  xxxd2037xxx ,
and progesterone concentrations were analysed by means of time-

results
medi-jector® performance
of all injections given during the study, injection by medijector® failed six times (5.4%) in five volunteers. one of these
failures was a technical defect of the device and no medication
was administered. in all other cases, the injections were
incomplete, which was obvious from a wet spot on the skin
at the site of injection. at the end of the study, all volunteers
were requested to indicate what method of administration they
preferred. it appeared that 10 preferred the medi-jector®
injections, two had no particular preference, and only four
subjects preferred the conventional needle injection.
local tolerance and safety
results on local tolerance are summarized in table i. apart
from a slightly increased incidence of redness after conventional needle injection (11.6 versus 5.4% by medi-jector®),
no apparent difference in local tolerance could be observed
after administration by medi-jector® compared to conventional

occurred 1 h after injection. the most frequently reported
moderate local tolerance items after either administration
method were swelling and redness (overall 4.9 and 8.5% per
injection respectively). with the exception of bruising, most
reactions had decreased or disappeared at 24 h.
both treatments were well tolerated, with most reporting
adverse events being of mild intensity. the most frequently
reported adverse events were headache and hot flushes (both
occurring in nine out of 16 subjects). none of the volunteers
had to discontinue from the study.
pharmacokinetics
evaluation of the pharmacokinetic results revealed that there
was no sequence effect and analysis of the pre-dose  xxxd2180xxx 
concentrations indicated that steady state was reached from day
3 onwards (data not shown). the mean  xxxd2180xxx  concentration–
time profile at steady state appeared to be very similar for
both methods of administration (figure 1).
the main pharmacokinetic parameters that were calculated from the  xxxd2180xxx  concentrations are presented in table

ii. peak concentrations (cmax) averaged 92.6 ng/ml and
95.6 ng/ml and occurred at 0.98 h and 1.47 h after dosing
(tmax) for the conventional needle and medi-jector® injections
respectively. mean auc values over one dosing interval
(auc0–24) were 775.6 and 803.7 ng.h/ml after administration
by conventional needle and medi-jector® respectively.
bioequivalence testing revealed that the two treatments were
bioequivalent with respect to all pharmacokinetic parameters,
except for tmax, for which bioequivalence could not be proven
because of a large variability.
pharmacodynamics
the pharmacodynamic effect was identical for both treatment
sequences (data not shown), and thus results of the two
treatment sequences were not analysed separately but rather
evaluated together as one group. the median pre-dose serum
lh, fsh and  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations, assessed during
 xxxd2180xxx  treatment, are shown in figure 2. after one injection, a
profound decrease of serum lh to undetectable concentrations
(below 0.6 iu/l) became apparent. median serum  xxxd2037xxx 
concentrations were already relatively low, but decreased
even further to undetectable concentrations (below 13.6 pg/ml)
after one injection. for fsh, a more gradual decrease in median

concentrations was observed and the limit of detection (1 iu/l)
was reached on day 10.
the percentages of volunteers that had undetectable
hormone concentrations during the treatment period are
presented additionally in figure 3. after a single injection,
50% of the subjects had serum lh and  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations
below the limit of detection and from treatment day 5 onwards,
this number had increased to more than 80%. for fsh, the
effect was less pronounced and a more gradual increase in
the number of subjects with undetectable fsh concentrations
was observed, with the maximal effect (80% of the subjects)
occurring during the last two treatment days. progesterone
concentrations remained low (median values between 0.4 and
0.6 ng/ml) during the entire treatment period, without any
significant change (data not shown).
discussion
in the present study, the feasibility of the medi-jector® for
multiple s.c. administrations of  xxxd2180xxx  was evaluated, based
on local tolerance and pharmacokinetics.
even though the women did not perform the injections
themselves, most of them indicated after the study that they
preferred the medi-jector® administration method. this is in
agreement with recently published data (verrips et al., 1998)
248

which compared growth hormone (gh) administration by
means of medi-jector® and conventional needle. on the other
hand there is also a report where the medi-jector® device was
not well accepted by the patients (houtzagers et al., 1988).
probably, the main reason to explain this difference is the fact
that in the latter study a medi-jector® device of a previous
generation has been used. meanwhile, development has continued, resulting in a newer device with improved performance
and better patient acceptance.
local tolerance data obtained in the present study confirm
earlier findings, that  xxxd2180xxx  has only minor histamine releasing properties. even after administration of relatively high
dosages and with an administration method that produces a
jet stream and thereby increases the contact with mast cells,
no major injection site reactions were observed. at 1 h after
injection, moderate swelling and skin redness were reported
most frequently. in general, these and other reactions reported
1 h after injection, disappeared during the next 24 h, except
for bruising, which is considered to be related rather to the
administration method itself, than to  xxxd2180xxx . overall, the
local tolerance data are in good agreement with those previously
reported in the 2 mg dose group of the dose-finding study
( xxxd2180xxx  dose-finding study group, 1998).
no difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between
administration of  xxxd2180xxx  by means of medi-jector®, when
compared to conventional needle injection. the concentration–
time profiles appeared extremely similar and the main
pharmacokinetic parameters (css, min, auc0–24 and cmax) were
bioequivalent, indicating that the dispersion which occurs after
injection by medi-jector® injection does not affect the rate
and extent of absorption of the drug. this is in line with other
reports on human growth hormone (verhagen et al., 1995;
houdijk et al., 1997) and insulin (pehling and gerich, 1984).
only for tmax could bioequivalence not be proven in the present
study, due to a large variability in the results. however,
considering the fact that the difference in tmax averaged only
0.5 h, it is unlikely that this will have any clinical implications
during long-term treatment with  xxxd2180xxx .
in line with the demonstrated bioequivalence of the two
administration methods, the pharmacodynamic effect was
identical for either treatment sequence, the suppression of
 xxxd2180xxx  on endogenous hormone concentrations being substantial. for most subjects, lh and  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations
were suppressed to undetectable concentrations within two
days. the profound lh suppression was also reported in the
dose-finding study, where 95% of all subjects in the 2 mg
dose group had serum lh concentrations below 1 iu/ml at
the day of hcg. fsh concentrations were also suppressed
considerably, although not as rapidly and extensively as lh
and  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations. the fact that fsh suppression
is less pronounced is in agreement with previous findings on
other gnrh antagonists (hall et al., 1988; fluker et al., 1991;
sommer et al., 1994) and has been explained by a longer
serum elimination half-life of fsh (jockenhövel et al., 1990)
and a differential regulation of lh and fsh secretion in the
gonadotrophe (hall et al., 1990). moreover, it can be explained
by the fact that gnrh antagonists suppress bioactive (b) fsh

gnrh antagonist  xxxd2180xxx  by medi-jector®

concentrations to a larger extent than immunoreactive (i) fsh,
thereby decreasing the b/i ratio (dahl et al., 1986).
as a result of prior oral contraceptive use, the volunteers
had relatively low serum  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations before
the first injection (ranging between ⬍13.6 and 94.1 pg/ml).
nevertheless,  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations were even further
suppressed immediately after starting  xxxd2180xxx  treatment. the
suppression appeared to be mainly lh related, which is in line
with the two-cell two-gonadotrophin concept, where it is
concluded that both fsh and lh are required for oestrogen
synthesis. additionally, immunoreactive instead of bioactive
fsh concentrations were measured in the current study. as
mentioned earlier, gnrh antagonists might suppress bioactive
fsh concentrations more profoundly than immunoreactive fsh
concentrations (dahl et al., 1986), contributing to an even larger
impairment of oestrogen synthesis. progesterone concentrations
remained low and did not change during the entire treatment
period, as a result of the profound suppression of serum lh and
fsh concentrations which inhibited ovulation.
medi-jector® injection failed six times in five volunteers,
which suggests that further technical improvement of this
device is warranted. interestingly, a failed injection did not
affect the extent of serum hormone suppression, indicating
that daily compliance with a dose of 2 mg is not pivotal. thus,
treatment failure is expected to be limited and does not have
to be a drawback in the use of the medi-jector® with a
relatively high dose of  xxxd2180xxx , especially when patients are
being trained adequately prior to the start of treatment.
in conclusion, s.c. administration of 2 mg  xxxd2180xxx  by
medi-jector® has been shown to be safe, well tolerated, and
bioequivalent to administration by means of a conventional
needle. thus, the medi-jector® might be a fair alternative for
self-administration during long-term treatment with  xxxd2180xxx ,
although this needs to be further substantiated in future trials.
