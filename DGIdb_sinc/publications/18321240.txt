background: microtubule stabilizing agents such as taxanes are an integral
part of therapy for multiple solid tumors. however, due to limitations of
these agents, newer more effective cytotoxic agents are necessary.
 xxxd2410xxx , an  xxxd2854xxx  analog, is a novel microtubule stabilizing
agent. objective: this review provides an updated summary of emerging
clinical experience with  xxxd2410xxx . methods: phase i, ii and iii clinical
trials presented in abstract form or journal articles found within a
pubmed search through november 2007 are described in this review.
results/conclusion:  xxxd2410xxx  offers promising clinical activity in a variety
of solid tumors.  xxxd2410xxx  is fda-approved for the treatment of breast
cancer refractory to anthracyclines and taxanes. the optimal dose and
schedule are still being defined, and the predominant side effects are bone
marrow suppression and neuropathy.

introduction

the microtubule has long been an effective chemotherapeutic target. microtubules
are filaments formed with the polymerization of alpha/beta tubulin subunits [1].
microtubule homeostasis is dependent on dynamic polymerization and
depolymerization of tubulin subunits, which leads to formation and functioning
of the mitotic spindle. taxanes are chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt
microtubule homeostasis by promoting tubulin stabilization and inhibiting
depolymerization, thus inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. although taxanes
are an integral part of cancer therapy, new promising agents are being developed
to overcome resistance to taxanes.
the epothilones are a novel class of non-taxane microtubule-stabilizing agentsderived from the fermentation of the myxobacterium sorangium cellulosum. they
represent a family of 16-membered ring macrolides [2,3]. epothilones are more
potent than taxanes and induce microtubule polymerization at submicromolarconcentrations in vitro [4,5]. in a similar fashion as taxanes, epothilones induce
microtubule bundling, formation of mitotic spindles, and mitotic arrest at the
g2/m phase of the cell cycle. the epothilones bind to a different site on
 xxxg2353xxx  than the taxanes and have lower susceptibility to multiple mechanisms
of tumor resistance [6,7]. epothilones therefore probably represent an important
treatment option for cancer patients, including those whose disease is resistant
to other currently available treatments. a few excellent reviews have been
published on the mechanism of action, biologic activity and preclinical data on
epothilones [5,8-10]. therefore, this review focuses on the clinical trials performed
with  xxxd2410xxx , an  xxxd2854xxx  analog.

 xxxd2410xxx 

aza- xxxd2854xxx  ( xxxd2410xxx ;  xxxd2410xxx ) is a semisynthetic analog of a natural product  xxxd2854xxx  that
binds to  xxxg2353xxx  and promotes tubulin polymerization
and mitotic arrest [7].  xxxd2410xxx  has improved metabolic
stability compared with natural  xxxd2854xxx  through
modification of the lactone to a lactam by replacing the
‘o’ group with ‘nh’ [5].  xxxd2410xxx  is less susceptible to
tumor resistance mechanisms such as overexpression of efflux
transporters, multi-drug resistance-associated protein 1 and
p-glycoprotein [7]. in vitro studies for administration to
rodents dissolved  xxxd2410xxx  into a mixture of cremophor,
ethanol and water or cremophor and ethanol.  xxxd2410xxx 
has demonstrated cytotoxic activity against a broad range of
tumor cell lines including pat-21 (a paclitaxel-resistant breast
cancer cell line), pat-7 (paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma
cell line), prostate, colon and lung carcinoma cell lines and
xenografts.  xxxd2410xxx  induced cytotoxicity in both
paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant cell lines at mean
ic50 of 3.9 nanomoles.  xxxd2410xxx  has 2.5-fold more
tubulin polymerization potency than paclitaxel. this drug
is cytotoxic when administered orally or intravenously.
 xxxd2410xxx  demonstrates synergistic antitumor activity in
combination with targeted agents such as trastuzumab and
other cytotoxic agents in preclinical studies. bt474 and
kpl-4 human breast cancer cell lines were grown as subcutaneous tumors in mice, which were subsequently treated
with trastuzumab,  xxxd2410xxx  or the combination. the
combination was more cytotoxic than  xxxd2410xxx  alone,
and produced 8 out of 8 complete responses [11].

phase i studies

several intravenous infusion schedules were evaluated in the
phase i setting, including a single dose every 3 weeks, a
daily dose for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks, daily dose
for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks, and a weekly schedule.
phase i studies examining single-agent  xxxd2410xxx  with
different schedules and doses as well as in combination with
other agents are listed in table 1.
3.1

single dose every three weeks

in one study, 25 patients with solid tumors received
 xxxd2410xxx  at 6 dose levels from 7.4 to 59.2 mg/m2 over one
hour intravenously [12]. patients were premedicated with oral
or intravenous dexamethasone and intravenous histamine-1
(h1) and histamine-2 (h2) blockers. a total of 85 cycles
and median of 4 cycles per patient were administered. four
patients achieved responses (2 minor and 2 partial responses
by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [recist]
criteria), including one patient that was treated with
29 mg/m2 [13]. one patient died at the 59.2 mg/m2 dose of
neutropenic sepsis, and 9 patients were therefore treated at
50 mg/m2. four out of 9 patients experienced dose-limiting
424

toxicities (dlt) including febrile neutropenia, grade 4
neutropenia lasting > 5 days, abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting. as no major toxicities were observed at 29 mg/m2,
40 mg/m2 was administered to 12 patients. two out of
12 patients experienced dlts of neutropenia but this dose
was the recommended phase ii dose for future studies.
common side effects of all grades by clinical toxicity criteria
(ctc) across all dose levels included fatigue (73.7%),
gastrointestinal discomfort (52%), diarrhea (24%) and
neuropathy (64%) [14]. pharmacologic data revealed that
the volume of distribution (vd) at steady-state was large
(826 l/m2) and that  xxxd2410xxx  has a long mean terminal
half-life (mean: 35 h at the 40 mg/m2 dose level) [12].
eight different  xxxd2410xxx  regimens were evaluated at 1 h
infusion doses of 7.4, 15, 30, 50, 57 and 65 mg/m2 or 3 h
infusion doses of 40 and 50 mg/m2 in 61 patients [15].
premedication with oral h1 and h2 blockers was administered in all patients after one patient experienced facial
flushing at the 30 mg/m2 dose over one hour. the median
number of cycles administered was two cycles. eight
patients including two with diffuse large cell lymphoma
achieved objective complete or partial responses by recist
criteria [13]. no dlt was observed with the one hour
infusion at doses < 50 mg/m2. eight out of 28 patients
treated at 50 mg/m2 over 1 h developed dlts such as
neutropenia, stomatitis, myalgia and arthralgia. the most
frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were sensory neuropathy
(13%), fatigue (13%), myalgia (10%), arthralgia (7%) and
nausea (5%) [14]. due to neuropathy, infusion time was
lengthened to 3 h. due to 4 out of 8 patients treated on the
50 mg/m2 over 3 h experiencing gi toxicities, 16 patients
were treated at 40 mg/m2 over 3 h. the maximum tolerated
dose (mtd) was established to be 50 mg/m2 over 1 h based
on an expanded cohort of 22 patients treated at this dose.
mean terminal half-life with the 40 or 50 mg/m2 over
3 h was 35 h. mean vd at steady-state was 1476 and 1511l
with 40 or 50 mg/m2 over 3 h, respectively. the data were
similar after cycles one and two. polymerized tubulin
increased as early as one hour after dosing and was
maintained for > 24 h postdose, demonstrating that
microtubule stabilizing activity occurred.
another phase i study evaluated the single dose every
3 weeks  xxxd2274xxx  dose levels ranging from 7.4 to 56 mg/m2
administered over one hour in 17 patients [16]. patients were
premedicated with intravenous h1 and h2 blockers as well
as oral dexamethasone 20 mg 12 and 6 h before therapy.
a total of 17 patients received 45 cycles. three patients
had tumor shrinkage but did not meet recist response
criteria. at 56 mg/m2, 2 out of 3 patients experienced dlt
of neutropenia, and one experienced grade 3 fatigue. one
out of 6 patients treated with the mtd of 40 mg/m2
experienced a dlt of grade 4 neutropenia. three patients
received at least 3 cycles at the 40 mg/m2 dose. grade 3/4
toxicities across all dose levels included nausea, myalgia,
fatigue and neutropenia. no grade 3 neuropathy was

reported at 40 mg/m2. the volume of distribution at
steady state ranged from 376 to 1898 l/m2, indicating that
 xxxd2410xxx  is extensively distributed. the mean terminal
half-life ranged from 24 to 72 h. pharmacokinetic data
showed that neither  xxxd2410xxx  clearance nor elimination
half-life were dose-dependent in this study. a correlation
between length of time that  xxxd2410xxx  plasma concentration
was > 15 ng/ml and the per cent change in neutrophil count
was found (spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = -0.59;
p = 0.0122), suggesting that neutropenia is related to duration
of  xxxd2410xxx  exposure above a threshold.
3.2

daily ¥ 5 or daily ¥ 3 every 3 weeks

another dosing schedule that was explored includes a
daily one hour infusion for 5 consecutive days [17].
dose levels ranging from 1.5 to 14 mg/m2/day were
administered to 27 patients; 25 patients received at least
2 cycles of 6 – 8 mg/m2/day. patients were premedicated
with intravenous h1 and h2 blockers 30 – 60 min before
 xxxd2410xxx  administration. five patients achieved partial
responses. three out of 3 patients treated with 8 mg/m2/day
experienced a dlt of neutropenia; an additional 6 patients
were treated with  xxxd2106xxx  support at this dose level, but
2 developed grade 4 neutropenia. the mtd was established
to be 6 mg/m2/day, and one patient experienced grade 3
neutropenia. other grade 3/4 toxicities included fatigue,
anorexia and mucositis. no patients experienced grade 3
neuropathy but 63% experienced grade 1/2 neuropathy.
the pharmacokinetic data showed that  xxxd2410xxx  displays
rapid tissue distribution and extensive tissue binding (vd at
steady-state was 798l); the mean terminal half-life was 16.8 h.
the total-body clearance of  xxxd2410xxx  was rapid and did
not seem to be dose dependent.
zhuang et al. explored 8 – 10 mg/m2/day administered
over one hour daily for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks [18].
patients were premedicated with oral and/or intravenous
h1 and h2 blockers 30 – 60 min before  xxxd2410xxx 
administration. a total of 26 patients received 119 cycles
of  xxxd2410xxx  and median of 2 cycles were administered.
three out of 6 patients that initially received 10 mg/m2/day
experienced dlt of neutropenia. due to the neutropenia,
15 patients then received 8 mg/m2/day, and 10 out of
15 patients were subsequently dose-escalated to 10 mg/m2/day.
only one of these 10 patients required  xxxd2106xxx  support.
two out of 15 patients developed grade 4 neutropenia,
one receiving 8 mg and other receiving the 10 mg dose
level. other grade 3/4 toxicities included fatigue, hyponatremia and ileus. no grade 3 neuropathy was observed, and
41% of patients experienced grade 1/2 neurotoxicity. the
recommended phase ii dose on this schedule is 8 mg/m2/day
with escalation to 10 mg/m2/day if tolerated.
3.3

weekly

 xxxd2410xxx  was administered at starting doses of 1, 2.5, 5,
10, 20, 25 and 30 mg/m2 over 30 min on a continuous
426

weekly schedule [19]. the absolute oral bioavailability of
 xxxd2410xxx  was assessed as well; thus patients also received
oral suspension or oral solution of  xxxd2410xxx  on day 6
before the first cycle. because sensory neuropathy was
dose-limiting in one patient, the study was amended to
administer  xxxd2410xxx  over one hour weekly for 3 weeks
followed by a one-week break to minimize neurotoxicity.
treated on the 21-day and 28-day schedules were 34 and
52 patients, respectively. five patients (2 patients on 21-day
schedule and 3 patients on 28-day schedule) achieved
partial responses. grade 3 fatigue was the dlt in 2 out
of 4 patients treated with 30 mg/m2. no dlts were seen
at doses ≤ 25 mg/m2 on the 21-day schedule, or at
doses of 15, 20 or 25 mg/m2 on the 28-day schedule.
the mtd was 25 mg/m2 for the 21-day schedule.
of 12 patients who received this dose and schedule, 1 patient
(8%) developed grade 3 sensory neuropathy and 3 (25%)
experienced grade 3 fatigue. because of neuropathy on the
25 mg/m2 28-day schedule, patients were subsequently
treated with 20 mg/m2. of 52 patients who received
20 mg/m2 on the 28-day schedule, 2 (13%) had grade 3
neutropenia, 1 (7%) had grade 3/4 sensory neuropathy and
4 (27%) had grade 3 fatigue. the pharmacokinetic data
are not yet reported. the recommended phase ii dose is
20 mg/m2 on the 28-day schedule.
3.4

combination

studies of  xxxd2410xxx  in combination with ketoconazole,
carboplatin,  xxxd425xxx , pegylated doxorubicin and
gemcitabine have been conducted [20-23]. in addition, a
trial administering  xxxd2410xxx  in patients with hepatic
impairment was also conducted [24].
3.4.1

 xxxd2410xxx /ketoconazole

because oxidative metabolism by cyp3a4/5 appears to be
a prominent route of  xxxd2410xxx  biotransformation in vitro,
a phase i study was undertaken to assess the effect of a
cyp3a4/5 inhibitor, ketoconazole, on the pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics of  xxxd2410xxx  [23]. patients were
administered a single 10 (n = 4), 20 (n = 12), 25 (n = 7) or
30 (n = 4) mg/m2 intravenous infusion of  xxxd2410xxx  with
ketoconazole 400 mg/day orally × 6 days, day -1 to day 5 during
cycle 1, and a single 40 mg/m2 infusion of  xxxd2410xxx 
during cycle 2 every 21 days. dlts of  xxxd2410xxx  with
ketoconazole at the 25 and 30 mg/m2 dose levels that
prompted a decrease to 20 mg/m2 with ketoconazole included
prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, mucositis,
diarrhea and fatigue. the observed adjusted geometric mean
of  xxxd2410xxx  auc for patients treated with ketoconazole
was 2892 compared with 1628 ng/ml/h in subjects without
ketoconazole. the ratios of the geometric means of normalized  xxxd2410xxx  auc and cmax in cycle 1/cycle 2 were 1.78
and 1.07, respectively. the difference in auc was statistically
significant. the per cent of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmcs) with tubulin bundle formation after

administration of 20 mg/m2  xxxd2410xxx  with ketoconazole
was similar to that observed with single agent  xxxd2410xxx 
at a dose of 40 mg/m2. the mtd of  xxxd2410xxx  with
ketoconazole was 20 mg/m2. these pharmacokinetic studies
suggest that inhibition of cyp3a4/5 by ketoconazole affects
the usual  xxxd2410xxx  tolerable dose of 40 mg/m2, increases
the auc and results in similar pharmacodynamic effects at
half the recommended dose of 20 mg/m2.

3.4.2

liposomal doxorubicin/ xxxd2410xxx 

a phase i study of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
(30 mg/m2) administered with  xxxd2410xxx  (doses 24, 30 or
40 mg/m2) intravenously over 3 h every 3 weeks was
conducted in 18 patients with metastatic breast and ovarian
cancer [25]. a total of 60 cycles have been administered. dlts
included mucositis and palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia
(ppe) in one patient on each dose level of  xxxd2410xxx .
other adverse events noted were grade 4 neutropenia and
grade 3 toxicities include ppe, mucositis, infection, fatigue,
neutropenia, neuropathy and increase in bilirubin. because
ppe and mucositis became problematic when treatment was
continued beyond two cycles, alternative schedules over a
28 day period are being explored.
3.4.3

 xxxd2410xxx / xxxd425xxx 

a phase i/ii study was conducted to determine the
recommended phase ii and iii doses of  xxxd2410xxx  and
 xxxd425xxx  in patients with metastatic breast cancer
previously treated with a taxane and an anthracycline in
the adjuvant or metastatic setting [22]. patients received
40 mg/m2 as a 3-h infusion of  xxxd2410xxx  given on day 1
(schedule a) or 6 – 8 mg/m2/day as a 1-h infusion for
3 consecutive days (schedule b) in combination with
 xxxd425xxx  1650 or 2000 mg/m2/day given orally on
days 1 – 14 every 21 days [22]. the results of 62 patients
that received 40 mg/m2  xxxd2410xxx  as a 3-h infusion
and 2000 mg/m2  xxxd425xxx  were reported. median
number of cycles administered was 4, and 30% achieved
partial responses. one patient experienced febrile neutropenia,
and 26% of patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia.
non-hematologic toxicities included grade 3 neuropathy
in 21% of patients and grade 3 hand–foot syndrome in
34% of patients. the recommended phase ii doses are
40 mg/m2  xxxd2410xxx  and 2000 mg/m2  xxxd425xxx .
3.5

 xxxd2410xxx  metabolism with hepatic impairment

because  xxxd2410xxx  is hepatically metabolized, a study was
performed to define dosing recommendations for patients
with varying degrees of hepatic impairment [24]. patients
were classified into hepatic dysfunction cohorts b
through d defined by a modified national cancer institute
(nci) organ dysfunction working group schema shown
in table 2.
a total of 73 patients received 171 cycles at doses ranging
from 10 to 40 mg/m2 as 3-h infusions every three weeks.

patients were treated at the 40, 40, 30 and 20 mg/m2 dose
levels for patients in groups a, b, c and d, respectively.
in group b, the dlts in 2 out of 12 patients treated at
30 mg/m2 were febrile neutropenia, grade 3 mucositis, and
grade 3 diarrhea. in group b, 2 out of 13 patients treated at
40 mg/m2 experienced febrile neutropenia, grade 3 nausea
and vomiting, somnolence and infection. in group c, the
dlts observed in 2 out of 10 patients treated at 20 mg/m2
were grade 3 dehydration and grade 3 muscle weakness. two
out of 3 patients in group c experienced dlts of febrile
neutropenia and grade 4 neutropenia when treated with
30 mg/m2. in group d, dlts of grade 3 infection and
grade 3 renal failure were observed in 2 out of 9 patients at
10 mg/m2. one out of 5 patients treated at 20 mg/m2 in
group d had a dlt of grade 3 infection. across all groups,
22% patients experienced peripheral neuropathy and
5% experienced grade 3 or 4 neuropathy. the recommended
 xxxd2410xxx  dose for group c patients is 30 mg/m2.
enrolment is still ongoing on this trial. pharmacokinetic
data showed that the auc was increased by 52% in group d
compared with controls in group a.
3.6 summary of phase i efficacy, safety
and pharmacokinetic data

over 400 patients were treated with  xxxd2410xxx  as a single
agent. in summary, the recommended doses for phase ii
trials based on phase i data are 40 mg/m2 over 3 h every
3 weeks, 6 mg/m2/day over one hour for 5 days every
three weeks, and 20 – 25 mg/m2 weekly days 1, 8 and
15 every 3 or 4 weeks [12,15-19,26]. there was evidence
of antitumor efficacy with each of the recommended
phase ii schedules.
the predominant toxicities across studies included
neutropenia, sensory neuropathy, fatigue, gastrointestinal
complaints, and myalgias/arthralgias [12,15-17,19,26-28].
hypersensitivity, a problem with paclitaxel which is formulated in cremophor, was not a problem on this study if
patients were premedicated with h1 and h2 blockers;
although some trials used corticosteroids, most patients
tolerated  xxxd2410xxx  with histamine blockers alone.
 xxxd2410xxx  seems to be tolerated in combination with
other cytotoxic agents such as  xxxd425xxx  with an
increase in bone marrow suppression being the predominant
side effect [20-22,25].
3.6.1

pharmacokinetics

the mean terminal half-lifes varied from 16 to 72 h, but do
not seem to be dose-dependent [16].  xxxd2410xxx  clearance
and elimination half-life were not dose-dependent. the
volume of distribution at steady-state across trials suggested
that  xxxd2410xxx  is extensively distributed. pbmcs exhibited
microtubule bundle formation (mbf) one hour after
 xxxd2410xxx  exposure; the tubule formation declined by 24 h

inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in significant increases in
the cmax and auc values compared with  xxxd2410xxx 
alone [23]. therefore, dose adjustments of  xxxd2410xxx 
should be considered for patients when taking a cyp3a4/5
inhibitor. data also suggest that patients with hepatic
moderate and severe hepatic impairment should receive
modified doses of  xxxd2410xxx  [24].

phase ii studies

phase ii studies of  xxxd2410xxx  have been conducted in
multiple tumor types including breast, prostate, renal cell,
lung, colon, sarcoma, pancreas, lymphoma, melanoma,
hepatobiliary, uroepithelial, germ cell and melanoma as
shown in table 3. other studies are ongoing as shown in
table 4. many patients were initially started on 50 mg/m2
over one or 3 h every 3 weeks but the dose was often
reduced to 40 mg/m2 due to neurotoxicity, bone marrow
suppression or mucositis.
4.1

breast cancer

 xxxd2410xxx  has been studied most extensively in different
patient populations with breast cancer. the nci studied
 xxxd2410xxx  with the daily × 5 schedule in patients with
taxane-pretreated as well as taxane-naive breast cancer [30,31].
out of 37 patients treated with a taxane either in the (neo)
adjuvant or metastatic setting, 22% achieved partial or
complete responses, 38% stable disease and 4 patients
progressive disease as their best response. five out of
eight patients who achieved partial or complete responses
had previously progressed while receiving a taxane. the
median time to progression was 80 days. twenty-nine, 22,
and 8% of patients developed grade 1, 2 and 3 neuropathy
respectively. grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 35% of
patients. other notable toxicities include febrile neutropenia
in 14% of patients, grade 3 or 4 fatigue in 13%, and
grade 3 myalgias/arthralgias in 3% of patients.
patients with metastatic breast cancer previously untreated
with taxanes received 6 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days
every 3 weeks [30]. out of 23 patients, 57% achieved a
partial response, 26% stable disease, and 4 patients developed progressive disease as best response. of 12 patients
on this trial previously treated with anthracyclines in
the (neo) adjuvant or metastatic setting, 58% patients
428

achieved partial responses. the median time to progression
was 5.5 months. thirty-nine, 13, and 0% of patients
developed grade 1, 2, and 3 sensory neuropathy respectively.
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 22% of patients.
notable grade 3 toxicities included fatigue in 13% and
motor neuropathy in 4% of patients.
three trials were conducted using the 40 – 50 mg/m2
dose every 3 weeks in 3 different populations. the response
rates in these trials ranged from 12 to 42%. the first of these
3 trials treated patients with metastatic or recurrent breast
cancer resistant to taxanes (must have received a taxane as
their most recent therapy; progression within 4 months of
taxane therapy) were treated with 40 mg/m2 over 3 h or
50 mg/m2 over 1 or 3 h. patients were also required to have
received prior anthracycline-based therapy [32]. due to
increased toxicities noted with the 50 mg/m2 dose, the
majority of patients were treated with the 40 mg/m2 dose.
the response rate in 49 patients treated with 40 mg/m2 was
12%; of 66 patients treated either with 40 or 50 mg/m2,
12% achieved a partial response rate. the median time to
progression was 2.2 and 2.3 months, respectively. grade 3
or 4 neuropathy was experienced by 12% treated on the
40 mg/m2, and 3 out of 8 patients treated with 50 mg/m2
over 1 h. of patients treated with 40 mg/m2, 51% developed
grade 1/2 neuropathy. other notable grade 3/4 toxicities on
the 40 mg/m2 arm included febrile neutropenia (6%),
neutropenia (53%), fatigue (27%), sensory neuropathy (12%),
myalgia (10%), nausea (6%) and vomiting (6%).
the second of these three trials treated patients with
taxane-, anthracycline- and  xxxd425xxx -resistant breast
cancer with 40 mg/m2 over 3 h every 3 weeks [33].
resistance was defined as progressive disease with each
of the agents within 8 weeks of therapy in the metastatic
setting or 6 months of (neo) adjuvant or adjuvant therapy,
or resistance to  xxxd425xxx  and taxane with a minimum
cumulative doxorubicin dose of 240 mg/m2 or  xxxd2008xxx 
360 mg/m2. twelve per cent of 113 evaluable patients
achieved partial responses, 45% stable disease, and
29% progressive disease as evaluated by the independent
review committee. the response rate as assessed by the
investigators was 18.3%. median duration of response
and progression-free survival were 5.7 and 3.1 months,
respectively. grade 3/4 and grade 1/2 neuropathy was
experienced by 14 and 49% of patients, respectively.

the third of the phase ii studies administered 40 mg/m2
over 3 h or 50 mg/m2 over 1 or 3 h every 3 weeks in 65,
19 and 9 patients with metastatic breast cancer previously
treated with an adjuvant anthracycline [34]. of the patients,
17% received a taxane in the adjuvant setting. the response
rates were 42, 58 and 22% in patients treated with
40 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2 over 1 h, and 50 mg/m2 over 3 h,
respectively. median time to progression was 4.8, 9.3
and 4.2 months, respectively. grade 3/4 neuropathy
developed in 23, 47 and 33% of patients. the median
number of cycles to grade 3/4 neuropathy was 6, 3 and 5.
grade 1/2 neuropathy occurred in 51% of patients. other
grade 3/4 toxicities with the 40 mg/m2 included neutropenia
(58%), fatigue (6%), myalgia (8%), arthralgia (5%), and
stomatitis/pharyngitis (5%).
4.2

prostate cancer

 xxxd2410xxx  has been studied as first or second line therapy
in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mcrpc).
a randomized phase ii trial compared  xxxd2410xxx 
35 mg/m2 dose every 3 weeks with mitoxantrone 14 mg/m2
every 3 weeks and prednisone 5 mg twice daily in
41 patients [35]. eligible patients had mcrpc that
progressed during taxane therapy or within 2 months
of completing taxane chemotherapy. four percent of
24 patients had objective partial responses, whereas 17%
had ≥ 50% reduction in  xxxg1281xxx  (psa)
with  xxxd2410xxx  alone; 10% of 21 patients achieved
partial responses and 20% had ≥ 50% reduction in
psa with mitoxantrone and prednisone. patients with
psa response on prior taxane therapy were more
likely to respond to either second-line agent, whereas
only 4% of patients without prior psa response
had decreases in psa with  xxxd2410xxx . patients that
progressed on each arm were allowed to cross over, and
3 out of 27  xxxd2410xxx -treated patients and 4 out of
15 mitoxantrone/prednisone patients achieved ≥ 50%
reduction in psa. notable grade 3/4 toxicities in patients
treated with  xxxd2410xxx  included neutropenia (54%), febrile
neutropenia, anorexia, stomatitis, fatigue, muscle weakness,
and prolonged prothrombin time.
another trial evaluated 40 mg/m2 every three weeks in
42 chemotherapy-naive patients with mcrpc [36]. there
were no objective responses in measurable disease but
33% of patients had ≥ 50% reduction in psa. the median
progression-free survival was 6 months. notable grade 3
toxicities included neuropathy (19%) and flu-like symptoms
(12%). grade 1/2 neuropathy and grade 3/4 neutropenia
were seen in 40% and 17% of patients.
the third trial randomized patients with chemotherapynaive mcrpc to 35 mg/m2  xxxd2410xxx  with or without
 xxxd2041xxx  280 mg three times a day for 5 days every
3 weeks [37]. of patients with measurable disease receiving
single agent  xxxd2410xxx , 32% achieved partial responses, and
48% had ≥ 50% reduction in psa. on the combination arm,

48% with measurable disease achieved partial responses
whereas 69% had ≥ 50% reduction in psa. time to
psa progression was 4.4 versus 5.2 months on the
single versus the combination arm. notable grade 3/4
toxicities included febrile neutropenia (4%), neutropenia
(22%), fatigue (9%), and neuropathy (13%) with  xxxd2410xxx 
alone, and neutropenia (29%), febrile neutropenia (8%),
fatigue (9%), neuropathy (7%) and thrombosis (6%) on the
combination arm.
4.3

lung cancer

patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who experienced
progression after one prior cisplatin or carboplatin-based
chemotherapy regimen were treated with 32 mg/m2
 xxxd2410xxx  over 3 h every 3 weeks (arm a) or 6 mg/m2/day
over one hour for 5 days every 3 weeks (arm b) [38].
this trial was amended twice to decrease the dose
from 50 to 40 mg/m2 and then from 40 to
32 mg/m2 due to high rates of neuropathy, neutropenia
and mucositis. of 77 patients on arm a and 69 patients on
arm b, ∼ 50% were treated with prior taxanes; response
rates were 14.3 and 11.6%, respectively. of patients that
received prior taxane therapy in the metastatic setting,
13 and 6% on each arm responded to  xxxd2410xxx . median
time to progression for each arm was 2.1 and 1.5 months.
grade 3 sensory neuropathy occurred in 5 and 6%
of patients, respectively; 29 and 20% developed any
grade neuropathy on each arm. other grade 3/4 toxicities on
each arm include fatigue (5 versus 9%), and neutropenia
(28 versus 17%).
4.4

renal cell carcinoma

results in studies of patients with renal cell carcinoma vary.
out of 67 patients treated with  xxxd2410xxx  6 mg/m2/day
over one hour for 5 days every 3 weeks, 14% achieved partial
responses [39]. grade 1, 2 and 3 neurotoxicity was observed
in 15, 17 and 2 patients, respectively. another trial, however,
noted no responses when 40 mg/m2 over 3 h every 3 weeks
was administered in 12 patients.
4.5

head and neck cancer

patients with recurrent head and neck cancer were treated
with  xxxd2410xxx  6 mg/m2/day over one hour for 5 days
(arm a) every 3 weeks or weekly 20 mg/m2 over one hour
on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days (arm b) [40]. of 85 total
patients, 53% of patients on arm a and 66% on arm b
were treated with prior taxanes. fourteen percent of
the taxane-naive arm on arm b achieved partial responses.
there were no responses in patients pretreated with
taxanes or treated on arm a. grade 3 neuropathy developed
in 33 and 24% of patients who were taxane-naive and
taxane-pretreated, respectively, on arm b. other grade 3/4
toxicities included fatigue (13%) and anemia (25%) in
patients on arm a and anemia (7%), leucopenia (9%) and
fatigue (21%) on arm b.

4.6

lymphoma

patients with relapsed aggressive non-hodgkin’s lymphoma
(nhl) were treated with  xxxd2410xxx  20 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 h on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle [41].
fifteen patients received a median of two cycles of
 xxxd2410xxx . of 14 evaluable patients, two achieved a partial
response, six stable disease, and six progressive disease. the
median time to progression and the progression-free survival
are 108 days. notable toxicities included grade 3/4 neutropenia
(40%), grade 3 neuropathy (33%) and grade 3/4 fatigue
(40%). all toxicity except for a grade 3 unilateral hearing
loss resolved to baseline with cessation of drug.
a phase ii trial evaluated  xxxd2410xxx  25 mg/m2 over one
hour weekly × 3 every 4 weeks in patients with subtypes
of nhl and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with disease
progression prior to study entry [42]. of the ten patients
with evaluable disease, six patients have achieved partial
responses. no grade 3/4 toxicities were reported.
4.7

phase iii trial in breast cancer

a large phase iii study compared  xxxd425xxx  alone with
 xxxd2410xxx  and  xxxd425xxx  in 752 patients with metastatic
breast cancer resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes [43].
resistance was defined as progressive disease within 3 or
4 months of anthracycline or taxane therapy, respectively,
in the metastatic setting; progressive disease within 6 or
12 months with anthracycline or taxane in the (neo)
adjuvant setting; the minimum cumulative dose of
doxorubicin 240 mg/m2 or  xxxd2008xxx  360 mg/m2 in patients
whose tumors were non-resistant to an anthracycline.
patients were randomized to  xxxd2410xxx  (40 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 h every 3 weeks) +  xxxd425xxx  (1000 mg/m2
orally twice a day for 14 days) or  xxxd425xxx  alone
(1250 mg/m2 orally twice a day for 14 days). a median
of 5 and 4 cycles of  xxxd2410xxx  +  xxxd425xxx  and
 xxxd425xxx  were administered.
the response rate in each arm was 35 and 14%,
respectively, (p < 0.0001) as assessed by an independent
review committee. the progression-free survival was
5.8 months in the combination arm and 4.2 months in the
 xxxd425xxx  alone arm (p = 0.0003). the most remarkable
toxicity difference was higher grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy in the combination arm (23 versus 0%). other
notable toxicities included febrile neutropenia (4% versus
1%, p = 0.001), grade 3/4 neutropenia (68 versus 11%,
p < 0.0001), myalgia (8 versus 3%), fatigue (9 versus
3%). neuropathy was primarily sensory, cumulative and
reversible (median time to resolution of grade 3/4 to
baseline/grade 1 was 6 weeks).  xxxd425xxx  toxicities
such as hand–foot syndrome were not exacerbated by the
combination arm. the progression-free survival benefit
of the combination was seen across various subgroups
including her2 positive and triple negative subtypes.
neutropenia-related death occurred in 1.9% of 414 patients
with normal hepatic function or mild hepatic impairment

expert opinion

 xxxd2410xxx  is a new chemotherapeutic agent against an
age-old target, the microtubule.  xxxd2410xxx  shows promising
activity in tumor types including breast, prostate, lung,
renal cell and head and neck cancer as well as lymphomas.
 xxxd2410xxx  is active in both taxane-naive and taxanepretreated populations, although the rates of response
are more modest in the latter population. advantages of
 xxxd2410xxx  over paclitaxel or docetaxel include that
premedication with corticosteroids is not necessary.
 xxxd2410xxx  has activity in breast cancer patient
populations that are chemotherapy-naive, taxane-naive and
taxane-refractory ranging from 12 to 57%. these rates of
response with single agent  xxxd2410xxx  are comparable
with taxanes,  xxxd425xxx , vinorelbine, gemcitabine and
doxorubicin, which are approved agents for breast
cancer [44-47]. the recently released phase iii data show
that  xxxd2410xxx  in combination with  xxxd425xxx 
improved response rate and progression-free survival
compared with  xxxd425xxx  alone [43]. however, the study
did not have a crossover arm where patients that received
 xxxd425xxx  alone subsequently received  xxxd2410xxx .
other studies have shown that patients exposed to
sequential cytotoxic agents in metastatic breast cancer
have equivalent overall survival compared with combination
cytotoxic therapy [48].
the fda-approved  xxxd2410xxx  in combination with
 xxxd425xxx  for the treatment of patients with metastatic
or locally advanced breast cancer resistant to treatment
with an anthracycline and a taxane, or whose cancer is
taxane resistant and for whom further anthracycline therapy
is contraindicated.
 xxxd2410xxx  is also approved as monotherapy for the
treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer
in patients whose tumors are resistant or refractory to
anthracyclines, taxanes and  xxxd425xxx .
the existing data suggest that single agent  xxxd2410xxx 
may be a reasonable alternative in patients whose disease has
progressed on a taxane, anthracycline and  xxxd425xxx  or in
patients that cannot take corticosteroids. combination
therapy should be considered in patients in whom a rapid
response is important; otherwise, sequential single agents
would be the optimal choice of treatment.
studies using  xxxd2410xxx  in mcrpc as first-line therapy
are promising, and further trials comparing  xxxd2410xxx 
to docetaxel are needed [49,50]. the data in renal cell
is promising on the daily × 5 schedule. although rates
of response are low with  xxxd2410xxx , few options exist
432

for renal cell carcinoma and agents such as sorafenib
are approved for renal cell carcinoma with similar
response rates [39,51,52].
challenges such as bone marrow suppression and
peripheral neuropathy, familiar toxicities with taxanes, are
also problematic with  xxxd2410xxx . the rates of significant
grade 3 peripheral neuropathy are as high as 20% in patients
that have been exposed to prior neurotoxic agents. although
initial data suggested that the rates of neuropathy are
lower in patients that receive 6 mg/m2/day for 5 days
every 3 weeks compared with a single dose every 3 weeks,
studies administering the 2 different schedules in the same
patient population suggest that rates may be less dramatically different [38]. neuropathy seems to be related to cumulative  xxxd2410xxx  dose and baseline neuropathy [33,53,54].
increased duration of peak concentrations of microtubulestabilizing agents such as paclitaxel may contribute to
increased neurotoxicity [55]. there is also a report that genetic
polymorphisms in p-glycoprotein may increase the risk of
developing neuropathy after treatment with paclitaxel,
and similar studies may be helpful with  xxxd2410xxx  [56].
neurologic function tests such as jebsen test of hand
function may predict grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy with  xxxd2410xxx , and more trials are needed to
validate these data [12,53]. the per cent of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells with microtubule bundle formation at
the end of  xxxd2410xxx  infusion correlated with the severity
of neutropenia [57].
 xxxd2410xxx  is metabolized by cyp3a4/5, and inhibition
of cyp3a4/5 by agents such as ketoconazole increases the
auc of  xxxd2410xxx . as  xxxd2410xxx  is further developed,
caution should be heeded with cyp3a4/5 inhibitors [23].
in addition,  xxxd2410xxx  dose should be reduced in patients
with hepatic impairment.
another challenge facing the development of  xxxd2410xxx 
is defining the optimal schedule and dose. multiple phase ii
studies have been performed with different schedules and
different doses. the original recommended doses from
phase i trials such as 50 mg/m2 proved to be too toxic,
and dose reductions were necessary. daily administration for
5 days seems to be an efficacious and tolerable regimen;
however, some patients may not find the 5 consecutive visits
for intravenous infusion optimal.
predictive biomarkers of toxicity or response to  xxxd2410xxx 
or other microtubule-stabilizing agents are yet to be
established. a recently completed pharmacogenomic study
using neoadjuvant  xxxd2410xxx  in newly diagnosed breast
cancer observed that low or absent expression of the
 xxxg730xxx  was the best single-gene predictor of
tumor response to  xxxd2410xxx  [58]. other groups have
reported increase in alpha-tubulin, a post-translational modification of tubulin that only occurs in polymerized
microtubules, with administration of  xxxd2410xxx . although
these data confirm that  xxxd2410xxx  is reaching the target,
there are no data yet to correlate with response [30,39].

attempts to differentiate predictors of response to paclitaxel
versus  xxxd2410xxx  in the neoadjuvant breast cancer setting
suggest that expression of microtubule-related genes may
warrant further study [58,59].
 xxxd2410xxx  is a promising agent effective in both
taxane-naive and taxane-resistant patients in certain
populations. this makes it an attractive drug for patients
with taxane-resistant disease. however, we do not yet
have randomized phase iii data comparing the efficacy
of docetaxel, paclitaxel,  xxxd2824xxx  and  xxxd2410xxx 
in patients to pick one optimal drug in taxane-naive
disease. further research should focus on pharmacogenomic
analysis to further elucidate which subpopulation of
