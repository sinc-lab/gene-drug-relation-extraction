tachykinin regulation
of airway smooth muscle cell proliferation.
am. j. physiol. 269 (lung cell. mol. physiol. 13): l339-l343,
1995.-the
tachykinins,
 xxxg2240xxx  (sp) and neurokinins
a
(nka) and b ( xxxg2241xxx ), have been identified
in the respiratory
tract and implicated
in mediating
neurogenic
inflammation
of
the airways. to the extent that these neuropeptides
may be
involved in the pathogenesis
of asthma, a condition associated
with hyperplasia
of airway smooth muscle (asm), we examined the mitogenic effects and mechanisms of action of tachykinins in cultured
rabbit asm cells. sp was found to elicit
dose-dependent
(lo- l4 to 10s4 m) stimulation
of asm cell
proliferation,
with a mean (*se)
maximal increase in cell
number of 169 2 6.1% of control. in contrast, nka and  xxxg2241xxx 
had little and no effect on asm cell growth, respectively.
because sp is nonselective
in its binding to the tachykinin
receptors,
to identify
the specific nk receptor
subtype(s)
mediating
the promitogenic
action of sp, in separate studies
we found that 1) the nki-receptor-specific
agonist, [p-ala4,
sarg, met(o#1]sp-(4-11)
induced stimulation
of asm cell
growth
similar in magnitude
to that elicited by sp; 2) in
contrast, neither the nk1- nor nkz-receptor-specific
agonists,
[p-ala8]nka-(4-10)
and [mephe7] xxxg2241xxx ,
respectively,
had
any effect on asm cell growth; and 3) the promitogenic
action
of sp was inhibited
by the nk1-receptor
antagonist,
gr82,334. moreover, in extended experiments,
we found that the
phospholipase
c and phospholipase
az inhibitors,
neomycin
and  xxxd3060xxx ,
respectively,
each inhibited
sp-induced
asm
cell proliferation
by - 45%. collectively,
these observations
provide new evidence that the tachykinin
sp induces asm cell
proliferation,
and that this action is mediated by transmembrane signaling
coupled to selective activation
of the nki
receptor.
neurokinin

receptors;

are a family of neuropeptides
that
share the common cooh-terminal
sequence phe-x-glyleu-met-nh,
and include  xxxg2240xxx  (sp), neurokinin
a (nka), and  xxxg2241xxx  ( xxxg2241xxx ). these peptides act
as neurotransmitters
in the central and peripheral
nervous systems, and have been implicated in mediating
the phenomenon of neurogenic inflammation
(5,1&z@.
three specific receptors for the tachykinins have been
identified pharmacologically
and from protein sequence
analysis, designated nk1, nk,, and nk, receptors (16,
18). the latter represent the classical seven-pass  xxxg1608xxx  structure containing a g proteinlinked domain, and exhibit preferential
activation by
sp, nka, and  xxxg2241xxx , respectively (10, 16). in the lung,
tachykinins are released from nonadrenergic/noncholinergic sensory nerve endings, which are present in both
the airways and pulmonary
vasculature

sion, airway epithelial and submucosal gland secretion,
enhanced ion transport, and altered contractility of the
airway smooth muscle (asm) (7).
in light of their above actions in the lung, recent
studies have examined the potential role of tachykinins
in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease. in this regard,
a marked increase in sp-like immunoreactive
nerves
has been demonstrated
in the airways of patients with
fatal asthma (26). moreover, elevated levels of sp have
been reported in the sputum of asthmatic patients (30)
and in the bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid from asthmatic
individuals after allergen challenge (22). on the basis of
these observations, together with recent evidence that
certain neurotransmitter
receptors also have the capacity to act as regulators of cellular proliferation
(4,14,20,
27, 33), including asm cells (25), the hypothesis is
raised that, apart from their above acute effects on
airway function, tachykinins may also act to regulate
asm cell proliferation.
the present study addressed the
latter hypothesis by examining the separate effects and
mechanisms of action of tachykinins on the proliferation
of cultured rabbit asm cells. our findings provide new
evidence that these neuropeptides
induce asm cell
mitogenesis via transmembrane
signaling mechanisms
associated with specific activation of the  xxxg2242xxx .

the mitogenic effects of the natural tachykinins,

and [mephe’lnkb,
respectively
(16, 181, were separately evaluated according to the following
protocol. asm cells were inoculated
at 1 x lo4 cells/cm2 in
2-cm2 tissue culture wells in ham’s f-12 containing
20% fbs.
at 24 h postinoculation,
the original
culture
medium was
replaced with serum-free
(sf) f-12 containing
various concentrations (range: lo-l2 to 10e4 m) of each of the above agents,
while corresponding
control cells were refed with sf f-12
alone. both the experimental
and control cells were then
counted on day 7 postinoculation.
in preparation
for cell
counting cells were sequentially
treated for 2 min with 2 ml of

the cell suspension
was diluted in counting fluid,
and the number
of cells was determined
using a coulter
counter. in all studies, the cell culture vessels were microscopically inspected
to ensure complete
cell detachment
after
treatment
with the above trypsin-containing
solution.
in a separate series of experiments
we investigated
whether
the asm cell proliferative
responses to sp were modulated
by
preincubation

our use of the above concentrations
for these agents was based
on both our previous studies (23,24) and preliminary
observations demonstrating
their maximal effectiveness.
finally, in extended studies, we investigated
whether the
above synthetic nki, nks-, and nks-receptor-specific
agonists
induce modulation
of fbs-stimulated
asm cell growth. in
these experiments,
cells were inoculated
as above and refed at
24 h postinoculation

elicit stimulation
of phospholipase c and phospholipase
a2 activity in different cell systems (1, 10,zl).
discussion

sensory axons in the lung are believed to mediate the
phenomenon of neurogenic inflammation
in the respiratory tract by releasing tachykinins
(5, 12, 28). in response to various noxious stimuli, tachykinins
are released from stimulated sensory vagal afferents and, via
an axon reflex, produce enhanced vascular permeability
of the airway mucosa, associated with plasma extravasation (5, 12, 28). the increase in vascular permeability
may also be accompanied by adhesion of eoisinophils
and neutrophils
to the vascular endothelium
(17, 31).
apart from these events, other consequences of tachykinin action include stimulated
secretion from airway
epithelial secretory cells and glands (6, 13), enhanced
epithelial cell ciliary activity (32), stimulated transepithelial transport (3, 19), contraction of the airway smooth
muscle (9, 15, 29), and facilitated airway choline@
neurotransmission
(9, 29). in light of these events,
several of which closely resemble the pathophysiological
features of asthma, a number of recent studies have
examined the role of tachykinins in the pathogenesis of
this disease. in this regard, a marked increase in sp-like
immunoreactive
nerves has been reported in the airways of patients with fatal asthma (26). in addition,
increased levels of sp in the bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid
has been reported in asthmatic patients, with further
enhancement of sp elaboration after allergen challenge
(22). these reports, in association with a host of studies
using animal models of asthma, have suggested a potentially important role for tachykinins in the pathogenesis
of this disorder.
in light of the above, coupled to the fact that chronic
asthma is characterized by asm hyperplasia and that
certain neurotransmitter
receptors have the capacity to
regulate cellular proliferation
(4, 14, 20, 27, 33), the
present study examined the role of tachykinins
in
regulating
asm cell proliferation.
our observations
demonstrated that 1) sp induces potent dose-dependent
stimulation of asm cell growth, whereas nka and  xxxg2241xxx 
exert little or no effect on asm cell proliferation;
2) the
promitogenic
action of sp is mediated by selective
activation of the  xxxg2242xxx ; and 3) the latter is
coupled to activation of  xxxg1759xxx  and phospholipase c via a pt-insensitive mechanism.
the natural tachykinins
are not selective in their
binding to the neurokinin
receptor subtypes and have
been shown to display a pattern of preferential
activation of the nk1, nk,, and nk, receptors by sp, nka,
and  xxxg2241xxx , respectively (10,16). accordingly, the present
observations
that sp was the most efficacious and
potent promitogenic tachykinin, comparable in maximal
efficacy to the proliferative
effects of thromboxane
and
leukotriene
d4 previously reported in our asm cells
(24), and that the corresponding
mitogenic actions of
nka or  xxxg2241xxx  were relatively minimal or absent (fig. z),
suggest that tachykinin-induced
asm cell growth was
largely mediated by activation of nk1 receptors. indeed,
in further support of this concept, our extended observa-

smooth

muscle

growth

tions demonstrated
that 1) the nk,-receptor-specific
agonist, [p-ala 8, sarg, met(02)11]sp-(4-11)
induced
stimulation of asm cell proliferation
similar in maximal
magnitude to that elicited by sp (fig. 3); 2) neither the
synthetic
 xxxg2240xxx - nor  xxxg2241xxx   xxxg2243xxx -receptor-specific
agonists,
[p-alas]nka-(4-10)
and [mephe7] xxxg2241xxx ,
respectively,
had any appreciable effect on asm cell growth; and 3)
the promitogenic
action of sp was inhibited by the
nk1-receptor-specific
antagonist,
gr-82,334 (fig. 4).
collectively, these observations strongly implicate selective activation of the  xxxg2242xxx  in mediating spinduced asm cell growth, a finding consistent with a
recent study reporting that the promitogenic effect of sp
in cultured human skin fibroblasts is largely mediated
by its interaction
with the nk+eceptor
subtype (33).
moreover, in this context, it should be noted that, apart
from their lack of a stimulatory
effect on asm cell
proliferation,
we found that the nk,- and  xxxg2241xxx   xxxg2243xxx -receptorspecific agonists also failed to inhibit serum-stimulated
asm cell growth. taken together, these observations
suggest that the latter tachykinin receptors likely do not
participate in regulating rabbit asm cell mitogenesis,
although the presence of nktz receptors associated with
altered contractility has been identified in rabbit airway
tissue (8, 16).
in addressing potential receptor-coupled
mechanisms
mediating our observed mitogenic action of sp, using
approaches previously applied in comparable studies in
our asm cells (23, 24), we found that the proliferative
response to sp was unaffected by pretreatment
of the
cells with pertussis toxin, and was inhibited by - 45%
after treatment
of the cells with either the phospholipase c inhibitor,
neomycin, or the  xxxg1759xxx 
inhibitor,
 xxxd3060xxx  (fig. 5). these observations are
consistent with previous reports demonstrating
a lack of
effect of pertussis toxin on sp-induced receptor/g protein-mediated
activity in certain cell types (ll), and that
sp can elicit stimulation of phospholipase c and  xxxg1759xxx  activity in different cell systems ( 1, 10, 21).
moreover, the present observations concur with our
previous findings in these asm cells wherein their
mitogenic responses to endothelinl(23)
and thromboxane (24) were found to be coupled to activation of
phospholipase az, the latter resulting in the release and
promitogenic
autocrine action of certain eicosanoids,
including thromboxane
a2 and leukotriene d4 (23, 24).
the specific functions of concomitant
activation of the
phosphopholipase
c and phospholipase
a2 signaling
pathways in mediating the mitogenic response to sp,
however, remain to be elucidated.
in conclusion, the present study investigated the role
and mechanism of action of tachykinins in regulating
asm cell proliferation.
the results demonstrated
that
1) sp induces a potent mitogenic response in cultured
rabbit asm cells; 2) in contrast, the tachykinins nka
and  xxxg2241xxx  have relatively little or no effect, respectively,
on asm cell growth; 3) the synthetic nk1-receptorspecific agonist, [p-ala2, sarg, met(02)11]sp-(4-ll),
exerts a stimulatory
effect on asm cell proliferation,
comparable in maximal magnitude to that induced by
sp; 4) in contrast,

nists have no effect on asm cell growth; 5) the promitogenie action of sp is inhibited by selective blockade of
the  xxxg2242xxx ; and 6) the proliferative response to sp
is near half-maximally
blocked either by inhibition
of
phospholipase c or of phospholipase az. taken together,
the above findings support a role for sp-induced regulation of asm cell growth and demonstrate that the action
of sp is mediated by transmembrane
signaling events
coupled to selective activation of the  xxxg2242xxx . the
latter, together with recent evidence that  xxxg234xxx  receptor
gene expression may be enhanced in the lungs of
asthmatic patients (z), suggests a potentially important
role for tachykinins, principally sp, in the pathogenesis
of the asm remodeling found in asthma.
