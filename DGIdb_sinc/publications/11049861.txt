r1776–r1786, 2000.—central administration of the serotonin receptor ligand  xxxd2621xxx  delays the decompensatory
response to hypotensive hemorrhage. this study was performed to determine the receptor subtype that mediates this
effect. lateral ventricular (lv) injection of  xxxd2621xxx  (40
␮g) delayed the hypotensive, bradycardic, and sympathoinhibitory responses to blood withdrawal (1.26 ml/min) in conscious rats. the response was quantified, in part, as the blood
volume withdrawal that produced a 40-mmhg fall in blood
pressure. the delayed hypotensive response produced by
 xxxd2621xxx  (8.2 ⫾ 0.2 vs. 5.6 ⫾ 0.2 ml, p ⬍ 0.01) was
reversed by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (ht)1a antagonist
way-100635 (30 ␮g iv: 6.7 ⫾ 0.4 ml, p ⬍ 0.01; 100 ␮g iv:
5.6 ⫾ 0.1 ml, p ⬍ 0.01). lv injection of the 5-ht1a agonist
(⫹)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin
(8-oh-dpat)
also delayed the hypotensive (10 ␮g: 8.6 ⫾ 0.3, p ⬍ 0.01; 20
␮g: 9.2 ⫾ 0.3 ml, p ⬍ 0.01), bradycardic, and sympathoinhibitory responses to hemorrhage. way-100635 (10 ␮g iv)
completely reversed the effects of 8-oh-dpat (20 ␮g: 5.4 ⫾
0.3 ml). neither selective blockade of 5-ht2 receptors nor
stimulation of 5-ht1b/1d receptors had any effect on hemorrhage responses. these data indicate that  xxxd2621xxx 
stimulates 5-ht1a receptors to delay the decompensatory
responses to hemorrhage.

a complex array of
neuroendocrine responses that help to maintain blood
pressure during the initial fall in blood volume. after a
critical blood volume loss (20–30%), however, a second,
decompensatory phase ensues that is characterized by
a sudden loss of sympathetic drive, reduced vascular
resistance, and hypotension (34). the trigger responsible for the sudden failure of the sympathetic compensatory response is unknown.
it has been suggested that central serotonin release
may be involved in this secondary decompensatory
response. specifically, serotonin depletion has been
shown to attenuate the bradycardic and hypotensive

responses to severe blood loss in anesthetized cats (12).
the same treatment was shown to abolish the bradycardic and sympathoinhibitory responses observed
during hypotensive hemorrhage in anesthetized rats
(28). systemic administration of the nonselective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)-receptor antagonist  xxxd2621xxx  was also shown to accelerate the recovery of
blood pressure and heart rate (hr) after severe blood
loss in cats and to prevent the bradycardic and sympatholytic responses to hypotensive hemorrhage in anesthetized rats (12, 28). central administration of  xxxd2621xxx  also prevented the fall in blood pressure and
peripheral resistance observed in rabbits subjected to
caval vein occlusion (15, 16). our own studies demonstrated that central  xxxd2621xxx  administration abolished the bradycardia and attenuated the renal sympathoinhibitory response to hemorrhage in conscious
rats at a dose that was ineffective when given systemically (40). together, these data suggest that endogenous central serotonin release causes or contributes to
the decompensatory response to severe hemorrhage.
nevertheless, the notion that endogenous serotonin
release leads to decompensation during hemorrhage
has come into question. in more recent studies, conscious, serotonin-depleted rabbits showed normal biphasic cardiovascular responses to central hypovolemia, suggesting that blockade of hemorrhage-induced
bradycardia and sympathoinhibition observed with serotonin depletion in prior studies was due, in part, to a
confounding effect of anesthesia (16). moreover, it is
unclear whether a purely antagonist action is responsible for the attenuated decompensatory response to
hemorrhage observed after  xxxd2621xxx  administration. though  xxxd2621xxx  has potent antagonist activity at a number of serotonergic receptor subtypes,
the drug also shows potent agonist actions on 5-ht1a,
5-ht1b, and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (23). indeed, evans et al.
(15) speculated that stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors
was responsible for the ability of  xxxd2621xxx  to prevent hypotension during hypovolemia in the rabbit.
the lack of a highly selective, potent antagonist for the
 xxxg1108xxx  prevented confirmation of this hypoth-

5-ht1a receptors and hemorrhage

esis. with the recent development of more potent and
selective antagonists, investigation of the pharmacological mechanism by which  xxxd2621xxx  acts to alter
hemorrhage responses is now feasible. therefore, this
study was performed to determine the receptor subtype
responsible for the ability of  xxxd2621xxx  to attenuate
the decompensatory response to hemorrhage in conscious rats.
methods

animals
all subjects were male sprague-dawley rats weighing between 350 and 400 g. animals were housed individually in
wire cages in the institution’s animal care unit with ad
libitum access to purina rat chow and tap water for at least
1 wk before surgery. the housing facility was maintained at
a constant temperature of 22 ⫾ 2 c° with a light-dark cycle of
12:12 h. all procedures were performed in accordance with
the institution’s guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals.
surgery
all subjects were anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 25
mg ip) and implanted with a right lateral ventricular (lv)
cannula (23-gauge hypodermic tubing) at least 10 days before
the experiment, as described previously (36). twenty-four
hours before the experiment, the rats were reanesthetized
(pentobarbital sodium, 25 mg ip) and implanted with a single
femoral venous catheter (tygon, norton performance plastics, akron, oh), bilateral femoral arterial catheters (pe-50
heat-welded to a length of pe-10), and a stainless steel,
bipolar recording electrode made from single-stranded, teflon-coated wire (bare diameter 0.005 in., a-m systems,
everett, wa) soldered to a female microconnector (microtech,
boothwyn, pa). the vascular catheters were tunneled subcutaneously to exit at the nape of the neck along with the
electrode assembly that was positioned through a left-flank
skin incision. the abdominal and back muscles were accessed
through the same flank incision, dissected, and retracted to
expose the renal artery. a 1- to 2-mm length of sympathetic
nerve emanating from the aorticorenal ganglion was isolated
and placed on hooks formed at the end of the electrode leads.
the nerve and hooks were embedded in a light-weight dental
silicon (bisico, bielefeld, germany). the flank incision was
sutured closed in two layers with the electrode leads coiled
within the subcutaneous space. the rats were allowed to
recover in their home cage for 24 h.
drugs
pentobarbital sodium was obtained from abbott laboratories (north chicago, il). hexamethonium chloride, used to
block postganglionic nerve activity, was obtained from sigma.
all other drugs were obtained from research biochemicals
international (natick, ma) including the nonselective serotonergic ligand  xxxd2621xxx  maleate, the selective 5-ht2-receptor antagonist ly-53857 maleate, the 5-ht1a-receptor agonist
(⫹)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat), the selective 5-ht1a-receptor antagonist way-100635, and the selective
5-ht1b/1d agonist cgs-12066. all drugs were diluted in isotonic
saline except  xxxd2621xxx  and cgs-12066, which were dissolved
in 20% 2-hydroxy-propyl-␤-cyclodextran diluted (wt/vol) in isotonic
saline.

data acquisition
during the experiment, arterial pressure, hr, and renal
sympathetic nerve activity (rsna) were recorded continuously. arterial pressure and hr were recorded with a
stathem p23 transducer, a grass bridge preamplifier (7p1),
and a grass tachograph (7p4). nerve activity was detected
with a grass high-performance ac preamplifier (p511) via a
grass high-impedance probe (f-hip511g). raw nerve activity was filtered (high pass: 100 hz, low pass: 3,000 hz) and
amplified (⫻20–50,000). the filtered and amplified neural
activity was monitored visually with an oscilloscope (model
2212, tektronics, beaverton, or) and simultaneously fed
through a grass integrator (7p10) for full-wave rectification.
the resulting voltage signal was integrated over 1-s intervals. the level of background noise in the nerve recording
was determined by blocking ganglionic transmission (hexamethonium chloride, 30 mg/kg iv) at the end of each experiment. the noise was subtracted from the entire recording,
and the remaining activity was expressed as a percent
change from baseline activity determined before any drug
treatment (average activity for a 5-min period immediately
before the first drug or vehicle injection).
analog arterial pressure, hr, and integrated rsna signals from the amplified sources were sampled by computer
using an analog-to-digital conversion card (data translation,
dt2812, marlboro, ma). the signals were sampled at 200 hz.
the values were collected using labtech notebook software
(version 7.1.1, laboratory technologies, wilmington, ma).
experimental protocols
experimental protocol 1: assessment of the effect of central
 xxxd2621xxx  on cardiovascular and sympathetic responses to
hemorrhage. the purpose of this protocol was to quantify the
degree to which central administration of  xxxd2621xxx  attenuates the hypotensive, bradycardic, and renal sympathoinhibitory responses to a fixed-rate blood withdrawal in
conscious, unrestrained rats. at least 24 h after electrode and
catheter implantation, the animals were connected to the
blood pressure and nerve recording apparatus while they
rested unrestrained in their home cage. the second arterial
catheter was connected to a preweighed heparinized 12-ml
syringe inserted into a harvard infusion/withdrawal pump.
a drug- or vehicle-filled injector was inserted into the central
guide cannula. the animals were allowed to habituate for at
least 2 h before the experiment. fifteen minutes of baseline
recording were taken, after which 40 ␮g (5 ␮l) of  xxxd2621xxx  or vehicle were injected over 2 min. this dose was
previously found to completely block the bradycardic response to a rapidly induced hypotensive hemorrhage in conscious rats (40). fifteen minutes after drug injection, hemorrhage was initiated by the withdrawal of blood at a rate of
1.26 ml/min. blood withdrawal was terminated after 6 min in
control animals. because the hypotensive response was delayed by  xxxd2621xxx  administration, blood withdrawal was
extended an additional 2 min in drug-treated rats to allow
examination of the hypotensive response. after termination
of the withdrawal, the blood-filled syringe was weighed to
validate the rate of blood withdrawal. data from the experiment were only included in the analysis if the actual volume
of blood withdrawn differed from the expected volume (as
determined by the rate and duration of withdrawal) by ⬍3%.
the animals were then given a bolus dose of hexamethonium
chloride (30 mg/kg) to block efferent rsna for determination
of background noise. after conclusion of the experiment,
proper lv cannula placement was determined by injecting a
1-␮l volume of diluted (1:10) india ink into the lv using the

same injector as used in the study. the animals were killed,
and the brains were removed and cut in coronal sections at
the level of cannulation and again at the level of the pontomedullary cistern. proper cannula placement was confirmed by the presence of ink throughout the ventricular
system as determined by visual inspection. only data from
rats with proper cannula placement were included in the
study.
experimental protocol 2: assessment of 5-ht2-receptor
blockade in the sympatholytic response to hemorrhage. this
experiment was performed to determine if selective blockade
of 5-ht2 receptors (i.e., 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, and 5-ht2c) mimicked the effects of  xxxd2621xxx  during hemorrhage. the
procedures used were identical to those described in protocol
1 except that control animals were injected with saline and
experimental animals were injected with 40 ␮g (80 nmol) of
the selective 5-ht2-receptor antagonist ly-53857. this dose
was chosen based on the similar affinity and antagonist
potency of ly-53857 and  xxxd2621xxx  at 5-ht2 receptors
(10, 14, 23).
experimental protocol 3: assessment of the effects of 5-ht1a
stimulation on the sympatholytic response to hemorrhage.
this experiment was performed to determine if stimulation
of central 5-ht1a receptors mimicked the effects of  xxxd2621xxx  on the cardiovascular and sympathetic responses to
hemorrhage. the same procedure was used as in protocol 1
except that a 20-␮g (60 nmol) dose of the selective 5-ht1areceptor agonist 8-oh-dpat was injected rather than  xxxd2621xxx . the 20-␮g dose was chosen based on preliminary
tests indicating that this dose produced maximal cardiovascular effects (e.g., bradycardia) when injected into the lv.
hemorrhage was terminated after 8 min in 8-oh-dpattreated animals to initiate a significant hypotensive response.
experimental protocol 4: assessment of selective 5-ht1areceptor blockade on the effects of 8-oh-dpat during hemorrhage. 8-oh-dpat was shown to produce a significant
delay in the hypotensive response to hemorrhage (see results). to verify that the observed effect of 8-oh-dpat was
due to activation of 5-ht1a receptors, the selective 5-ht1areceptor antagonist way-100635 was given before 8-ohdpat injection. the same procedures as outlined in protocol
3 were followed except that way-100635 (10 ␮g or 20 nmol
iv) was given 15 min before 8-oh-dpat injection. in preliminary studies, this dose of antagonist was found to be the
lowest dose that consistently blocked the cardiovascular effects of 8-oh-dpat (20 ␮g lv injection). an additional group
of animals was given way-100635 (10 ␮g iv) alone, 30 min
before hemorrhage. hemorrhage was terminated after 6 min
in groups pretreated with way-100635.
experimental protocol 5: determination of the dose dependency of 8-oh-dpat to delay the hypotensive response to
hemorrhage. rats that appeared healthy but did not have
viable nerves on the day of the experiment were treated as in
protocol 4 except that the dose of 8-oh-dpat was varied (1-,
3-, 5-, and 10-␮g lv injections). the drug was diluted such
that an equivalent volume (5 ␮l) was delivered for each
experiment. the average volume of blood withdrawn at the
time blood pressure had fallen 40 mmhg from prehemorrhage baseline values was determined for each dose of 8-ohdpat. data from experiments performed in protocol 3 (i.e.,
20 ␮g 8-oh-dpat) were included in the analysis to provide
a more complete dose-response curve.
experimental protocol 6: assessment of the effects of
5-ht1b/1d-receptor activation on the cardiovascular and sympathetic responses to hemorrhage. this protocol was performed to determine whether activation of 5-ht1b/1d recep-

tors by the selective 5-ht1b/1d-receptor agonist cgs-12066
mimicked the effects of  xxxd2621xxx  during hemorrhage.
the same procedure was performed as in protocol 1 except
that 40 ␮g of cgs-12066 (89 nmol) were lv injected before
hemorrhage.
experimental protocol 7: assessment of the effects of
5-ht1a-receptor blockade on the ability of  xxxd2621xxx  to
attenuate the sympatholytic response to hemorrhage. the
same procedure was followed as in protocol 1 except that
way-100635 (10, 30, or 100 ␮g iv) was given 15 min before
central  xxxd2621xxx  injection. in these experiments, blood
withdrawal was continued for 8 min after either the 10- or
30-␮g dose of antagonist but was terminated after 6 min in
animals given 100 ␮g of the antagonist.
data analysis
blood pressure, hr, and rsna values were averaged over
30-s blocks. a two-way anova with repeated measures was
used to determine the effects of drug on map, hr, and rsna
responses beginning 30 s before the start of blood withdrawal
through 6 min of hemorrhage. the last 2 min of data collected
from animals subjected to 8 min of hemorrhage were not
subjected to between-group comparisons. significant interactions between drug and time were followed up with post hoc
tests to compare group means at each time interval from 30 s
before the onset of hemorrhage through 6 min of blood withdrawal. the results were adjusted for repeated measures (see
below). unpaired, adjusted student’s t-tests were used when
two groups were compared. bonferroni post hoc tests were
used when three or more groups were compared. adjusted,
paired student’s t-tests were used to make within-group
comparisons between prehemorrhage baseline values and
values obtained at each 30-s time interval throughout blood
withdrawal. p values of ⬍0.05 were accepted as significant
for anova. the acceptable significance of p values for between- and within-group post hoc tests was adjusted using
the dunn-šidàck method to control for repeated comparisons,
i.e., using the equation p⬘⫽ 1 ⫺ (1 ⫺ p)k with p equal to the
acceptable preadjustment level of significance (i.e., 0.05),
p⬘equal to the adjusted acceptable level of significance, and k
equal to the number of comparisons (26). as described, some
groups were subjected to an additional 2 min of blood withdrawal (i.e., 4 extra comparisons). therefore, the acceptable
significant p values for within-group comparisons was based
on the larger number of comparisons for all treatment groups
in order that the stringency to reach significance was not
different between groups.
one-way anovas were used to assess the effect of drug
dose on the volume of blood withdrawal that produced a
40-mmhg fall in blood pressure. a dose-response curve for
data from protocol 5 was constructed using a least-squares
regression analysis to fit the data to a four-parameter logistic
function with sigma plot (version 2.01). the half-maximal
effective dose (ed50) was calculated from the resulting bestfit curve. one-way anovas were also used to assess the
ability of the 5-ht1a-receptor antagonist to reverse the effect
of  xxxd2621xxx  on the change in map, hr, and rsna
during 6 min of hemorrhage.

hemorrhage. summary data for each treatment group
are shown in fig. 2. baseline and hemorrhage responses in vehicle (n ⫽ 3)- and saline-injected animals
(n ⫽ 4) were identical. therefore, data from the two
groups were pooled to provide control data for all experiments. in control experiments, hemorrhage produced a biphasic response. in the first phase, blood
pressure was well maintained during the initial 3.5
min of blood withdrawal. this nonhypotensive phase of
hemorrhage was accompanied by a significant rise in
hr and rsna. this initial phase was followed by a
sudden fall in pressure beginning after ⬃4 min of blood
withdrawal. the hypotensive response occurred simultaneously with a fall in hr and rsna, although rsna
did not fall significantly below the original baseline.
hr showed a dramatic fall that remained significantly
lower than baseline throughout the remainder of hemorrhage.
central injection of  xxxd2621xxx  significantly lowered baseline hr and elevated baseline rsna as
shown by the significant difference between groups
before the start of hemorrhage in fig. 2. after injection
of  xxxd2621xxx , bradycardia developed slowly, simultaneously with the onset of hindlimb abduction, a behavior characteristic of 5-ht1a-receptor stimulation
(42). in contrast to controls, the  xxxd2621xxx -treated
group showed only a slight, nonsignificant tachycardia
during the initial phase of hemorrhage.  xxxd2621xxx 
also appeared to block the sudden fall in map, hr, and
rsna observed in control animals subjected to hemorrhage. instead, map began to decline slowly after ⬃5

min of blood withdrawal. rsna only began to fall after
6.5 min of blood withdrawal. after 8 min of hemorrhage, the  xxxd2621xxx -treated group began to show a
decline in hr. however, the response did not reach
significance (fig. 2).
effect of 5-ht2-receptor blockade
lv administration of the 5-ht2-receptor antagonist
ly-53857 significantly increased baseline rsna (fig.
3), an effect characteristic of 5-ht2-receptor blockade
in the anesthetized rat (31). despite the sympathoexcitatory effect of 5-ht2 blockade, the hemorrhage-induced cardiovascular responses of drug-treated animals did not differ from control animals (fig. 3).
effect of 5-ht1a-receptor stimulation
central administration of the 5-ht1a-receptor agonist 8-oh-dpat produced a pronounced behavioral
effect consisting of the classic  xxxg1108xxx -mediated hindlimb abduction (42). the onset of the behavioral response occurred simultaneous with a decrease
in blood pressure and hr. during the initial phase of
hemorrhage, 8-oh-dpat-treated rats showed a significant sympathoexcitatory response accompanied by a
slowly developing tachycardic response that did not
reach significance until after 5.5 min of hemorrhage. in
contrast, control animals showed a significant tachycardic response after just 1.5 min of blood withdrawal.
similarly, the initial rise of rsna developed more
slowly in 8-oh-dpat rats compared with controls.
however, the maximal sympathoexcitatory response

5-ht1a receptors and hemorrhage

administration of 10 ␮g way-100635 alone had no
effects on the map, hr, or rsna response to hemorrhage (fig. 5).
dose dependency of 8-oh-dpat to delay hypotensive
response to hemorrhage
8-oh-dpat dose-dependently increased the volume
of blood withdrawal necessary to produce a 40-mmhg
drop in blood pressure (fig. 6). in control animals,
blood pressure dropped by 40 mmhg after withdrawal
of 5.6 ⫾ 0.2 ml of blood. at the maximum dose of
8-oh-dpat tested (20 ␮g), withdrawal of 9.2 ⫾ 0.3 ml
of blood produced the same fall in blood pressure, an
increase of 64% (p ⬍ 0.01). the calculated ed50 for the
response was 5.9 ␮g. prior administration of way100635 (10 ␮g) completely reversed the effects of the
20-␮g dose of 8-oh-dpat (5.4 ⫾ 0.3 ml).
effect of 5-ht1b/1d-receptor stimulation
all rats treated with the selective 5-ht1b/1d-receptor
agonist cgs-12066 showed signs of increased alertness and activity within 2–3 min after injection consistent with the locomotor stimulatory effects attributed to 5-ht1b-receptor agonist administration (9).

showed a delayed hypotensive response to hemorrhage
compared with controls. in addition, the tachycardic
response to hemorrhage persisted throughout the duration of hemorrhage, whereas the onset of the sympathoinhibitory and hypotensive responses to hemorrhage were no longer coupled in 8-oh-dpat-treated
rats. specifically, sympathetic activity continued to
rise during the beginning of hypotension and only
began to decline slowly after 6 min of hemorrhage (fig.

way-100635 (10 ␮g iv) completely blocked behavioral
responses to the 20-␮g dose of 8-oh-dpat (data not

map and hr between animals treated with vehicle
and those given the 5-ht1a-receptor antagonist before
8-oh-dpat injection (fig. 4). antagonist administration also completely reestablished the normal biphasic

5-ht1a receptors and hemorrhage

 xxxd2621xxx , as well as the 5-ht1a-receptor agonist
8-oh-dpat, delayed the hypotensive, bradycardic,
and renal sympathoinhibitory responses to fixed-rate
hemorrhage in the conscious rat. the ability of 8-ohdpat to delay the hypotensive response to hemorrhage was dose dependent. in addition, the highly
potent and selective 5-ht1a-receptor antagonist way100635 reversed the effects of both 8-oh-dpat and
 xxxd2621xxx . neither the 5-ht2 antagonist ly-53857
nor the 5-ht1b/1d agonist cgs-12066 had any effect on
responses to hemorrhage. this study is the first definitive demonstration that the ability of  xxxd2621xxx  to
attenuate the hypotensive bradycardic and sympathoinhibitory responses to hemorrhage is mediated by
an agonist action on 5-ht1a receptors.
 xxxd2621xxx  is an ergoline derivative with potent

studies indicate that  xxxd2621xxx  also activates a
subset of 5-ht1 receptors. specifically, the  xxxd2621xxx -mediated vasoconstriction observed in several

an agonist effect on  xxxg1110xxx  and 5-ht1b receptors (7,
11, 20, 21, 43). in addition, second messenger assays

ec50 ⫽ 6.4) and fully effective 5-ht1a-receptor agonist
(36). in a previous study, we found that the lowest dose
of  xxxd2621xxx  sufficient to delay the hypotensive
response to hemorrhage also produced hindlimb abduction and lowered baseline blood pressure and hr, effects characteristic of 5-ht1a-receptor activation (18).
in the present study, the effect of  xxxd2621xxx  on
hemorrhage-induced cardiovascular responses was
dose dependently eliminated by prior treatment with
way-100635, a recently developed, highly potent, and
selective 5-ht1a-receptor antagonist without inverse
agonist activity (17). together, these data support the
hypothesis that  xxxd2621xxx  attenuates hemorrhage
responses through stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors.
 xxxd2621xxx  is a potent antagonist of the 5-ht2
receptor family. in this study, the persistent sympathoexcitatory response to  xxxd2621xxx  was mimicked
by the selective 5-ht2-receptor antagonist ly-53857
but not the 5-ht1a agonist 8-oh-dpat. these findings suggest that the initial sympathoexcitatory response to  xxxd2621xxx  was due to blockade of 5-ht2
receptors and was unrelated to the 5-ht1a-mediated
effects of the drug. similar sympathoexcitatory responses to 5-ht2-receptor blockade have been observed
in anesthetized animals (31). in contrast to  xxxd2621xxx , ly-53857 had no effect on the cardiovascular and
sympathetic responses to hemorrhage. in a previous
study, evans and colleagues (15, 16) found that ly-

53857 was equipotent to  xxxd2621xxx  in preventing
the hypotensive response to central hypovolemia in
conscious rabbits. however, these authors found a poor
correlation between the potency of various ligands to
prevent hypovolemia-induced hypotension and their
respective affinities for rabbit 5-ht2 receptors. instead, ly-53857 was found to have some affinity for
5-ht1a receptors, suggesting that the drug may have
stimulated 5-ht1a receptors to alter hypovolemia-induced responses (15). the apparent contradiction between the literature and the present study may have
resulted from a species difference in the potency of
ly-53857 at 5-ht1a receptors.
the possibility that 5-ht1b- or  xxxg1110xxx -receptor activation contributes to the protective effect of  xxxd2621xxx  during hemorrhage seems unlikely because
 xxxd2621xxx  has only limited intrinsic activity at
these receptors (37). in the present study, cgs-12066,
a more potent and efficacious 5-ht1b- and 5-ht1dreceptor agonist than  xxxd2621xxx , had no effect on
either baseline or hemorrhage-induced cardiovascular
responses when given at a slightly higher dose than
 xxxd2621xxx  (23, 37, 38). however, in vitro studies
have shown that cgs-12066 and  xxxd2621xxx  are
equally potent and fully efficacious 5-ht1a-receptor
agonists (23, 36, 38). therefore, it is surprising that
cgs-12066 did not produce 5-ht1a-mediated behav-

ioral effects or influence hemorrhage responses when
given at a higher dose than  xxxd2621xxx . interestingly, several studies have documented the ability of
5-ht2-receptor blockade to enhance neuronal responses to 5-ht1a-receptor stimulation (4, 6). given
that cgs-12066 has only very limited affinity for
5-ht2 receptors and only a negligible effect on 5-ht2
receptor-mediated responses, it seems likely that the
ability of  xxxd2621xxx  to produce observable 5-ht1amediated effects may be dependent on a concurrent
blockade of 5-ht2 receptors (23, 38).

the possibility that other serotonergic receptor subtypes might have contributed to the effects of  xxxd2621xxx  during hemorrhage was not tested in the
present study.  xxxd2621xxx  shows high affinity for
human recombinant  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors.
though it is not clear whether these receptors are
expressed in the rat brain, it is apparent that 8-ohdpat has little affinity for either receptor, suggesting
that they have little role in the delay of the hemorrhage-induced cardiovascular responses observed in
the present study (1, 2, 25, 45). the role of 5-ht3 and
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors was not tested in this study, because
 xxxd2621xxx  has very low affinity for these receptors
(8, 24, 27).  xxxd2621xxx  does bind rat recombinant
 xxxg1118xxx , 5-ht5b, and  xxxg1119xxx  receptors with high affinity.
however, these receptors are insensitive to 8-ohdpat, suggesting that they have no role in hemorrhage responses observed in the present study (5, 13).
 xxxd2621xxx  also has antagonist properties at 5-ht7
receptors (33, 44). however, it is unlikely that the
effects of  xxxd2621xxx  were due to blockade of endogenous 5-ht7-receptor activation, because 8-oh-dpat,
a potent agonist of 5-ht7 receptors, had no effect on
hemorrhage responses after selective 5-ht1a-receptor
blockade (11).
8-oh-dpat delayed the response to hemorrhage at
a lower dose than  xxxd2621xxx . this is not surprising
given that 8-oh-dpat is a more potent 5-ht1a-receptor agonist than  xxxd2621xxx  (8.2 vs. 6.4 log ec50)
(36). moreover, a 10-fold higher dose of way-100635
was needed to completely block the effects of  xxxd2621xxx  than was needed to block the effects of 8-ohdpat, suggesting that a larger degree of 5-ht1a-receptor binding was necessary for  xxxd2621xxx  to delay
the hypotensive response to hemorrhage. the 40-␮g
dose of  xxxd2621xxx  produced a similar, but slightly
reduced, delay in the hypotensive response to hemorrhage compared with the 20-␮g dose of 8-oh-dpat.
however, the same dose of  xxxd2621xxx  completely
suppressed the tachycardic response to blood withdrawal, whereas 8-oh-dpat only partially sup-

5-ht1a receptors and hemorrhage

pressed this response. the possibility that activation of
5-ht1a receptors mediated the attenuated tachycardic
response to hemorrhage is consistent with evidence
that 5-ht1a-receptor stimulation decreases cardiac
sympathetic tone and increases cardiac parasympathetic drive (19). such an effect could potentially override the baroreflex-mediated tachycardic response during the initial phase of hemorrhage. it is possible that
 xxxd2621xxx  provided a more complete suppression of
the tachycardic response to hemorrhage by stimulating
a larger  xxxg1108xxx -mediated response than
8-oh-dpat. however, the latter drug produced a
more pronounced bradycardia than did  xxxd2621xxx ,
suggesting that 8-oh-dpat produced a larger 5-ht1a
receptor-mediated effect on cardiac autonomic tone. it
is more likely then that  xxxd2621xxx  suppressed the
tachycardic response to hemorrhage by effects on more
than one receptor subtype. however, results of this
study do not provide evidence as to what receptor
subtypes, other than the  xxxg1108xxx , may have
contributed to the effect.
whereas the current study suggests that 5-ht1areceptor activation delays the hypotensive response to
hemorrhage, what remains in doubt is the location of
the receptors responsible for the effect. scrogin et al.
(40) showed that a central dose of  xxxd2621xxx , comparable with that used in the present study, had no
effect on hemorrhage responses when given systemically. this evidence, together with that provided by the
present study, suggests that activation of 5-ht1a receptors within the central nervous system likely mediates the delayed decompensatory response to severe
hemorrhage. 5-ht1a receptors are expressed presynaptically on the soma and dendrites of serotonergic
neurons as well as postsynaptically throughout the
brain and spinal cord. stimulation of presynaptic
5-ht1a receptors reduces the release of serotonin from
axon terminals (30). therefore, the possibility remains
that 5-ht1a agonists delay the hypotensive response to
hemorrhage by attenuating endogenous serotonin release. whereas this notion is consistent with evidence
that serotonin depletion attenuates the hypotensive
and sympatholytic response to hemorrhage in anesthetized rats and cats, it is contradicted by indications
that serotonin depletion has no effect on hemorrhage
responses in conscious rabbits (12, 16, 28). as yet, this
controversy remains to be resolved. however, our findings that 5-ht1a-receptor blockade did not accelerate
the hemorrhage-induced fall in sympathetic activity
suggests that postsynaptic 5-ht1a-receptor activation,
rather than decreased endogenous serotonin release,
accounts for the observed effects of exogenous 5-ht1areceptor agonist administration during hemorrhage.
significant cardiovascular depressor effects including hypotension, bradycardia, and sympathoinhibition,
are elicited by postsynaptic 5-ht1a-receptor activation
in the hindbrain (18, 22, 29). in contrast, tachycardic,
hypertensive, and sympathoexcitatory responses have
been found with low-dose forebrain administration of
8-oh-dpat (3). in our own preliminary studies, injection of the drug into the lv produced a biphasic re-

sponse consisting of initial pressor, tachycardic, and
sympathoexcitatory responses followed by bradycardia, mild hypotension, and sympathoinhibition (39).
this profile of responses suggests that the early pressor effects are due to excitation of forebrain structures
near the site of injection that are eventually overwhelmed by an inhibitory effect of hindbrain receptor
activation after drug diffusion. our work indicates that
the initial excitatory responses (data not presented) as
well as the subsequent depressor effects of 8-oh-dpat
are due to 5-ht1a activation, because all were blocked by
the selective 5-ht1a-receptor antagonist way-100635.
nevertheless, the data presented here do not provide
evidence as to which set of responses, if either, is related
to the ability of  xxxd2621xxx  or 8-oh-dpat to attenuate
the hypotensive response to hemorrhage.
the efferent hemodynamic mechanisms that account
for the delayed hypotensive response to hemorrhage
after 5-ht1a-receptor stimulation are unknown. the
continued increase in renal sympathetic activity observed during hemorrhage in 5-ht1a-receptor agonisttreated rats could have supported blood pressure by
augmenting renin release and thus increased  xxxg99xxx - and vasopressin-mediated vascular resistance. alternatively, the rise in renal sympathetic activity may have been accompanied by an increased
sympathetic drive to other vascular beds resulting in
sympathetic-mediated preservation of peripheral resistance. presently, it is unclear whether 5-ht1a-receptor
stimulation affects vasoactive peptide release or sympathetic tone in other vascular beds during the process
of hemorrhage.
in summary, the present study provides unique evidence that the well-established ability of the nonselective serotonergic receptor ligand  xxxd2621xxx  to attenuate the hypotensive and sympatholytic responses
to hemorrhage in rats is due to activation of 5-ht1a
receptors.
perspectives
the notion that endogenous serotonin release mediates, at least in part, the sympatholytic response to
hemorrhage and other sympatholytic pathologies has
been discussed for many years (35, 41). this notion is
based primarily on evidence that  xxxd2621xxx  blocks
the rapid sympatholytic effect of hemorrhage and that
a similar effect is produced by serotonin depletion in
anesthetized animals (12, 15, 28, 40). a previous study
by evans et al. (15) has already shed some doubt on the
possibility that depletion of endogenous serotonin delays the sympatholytic response to hemorrhage in conscious animals. our present findings that the effect of
 xxxd2621xxx  during hemorrhage is mediated by an
agonist action on 5-ht1a receptors and that 5-ht1areceptor blockade has virtually no effect on hemorrhage further contradict the hypothesis that endogenous serotonin release mediates the rapid onset of
hypotension during severe hemorrhage. though this
study would seem to rule out a role for endogenous
serotonin release in the decompensatory response to

hemorrhage, it does indicate that 5-ht1a-receptor activation can profoundly influence autonomic control of
blood pressure, particularly during hypovolemia. what
remains to be determined is what role, if any, endogenous activation of these receptors plays in the regulation of blood pressure and blood volume. moreover, it is
of interest to determine whether the pharmacological
phenomenon described here can be exploited as a potential treatment in circulatory shock or other pathologies associated with loss of vascular sympathetic tone.
