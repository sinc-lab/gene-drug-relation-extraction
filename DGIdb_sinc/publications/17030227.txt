aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that
inhibit cox-1 induce unique nonallergic reactions, consisting
of attacks of rhinitis and asthma. these hypersensitivity
reactions occur in a subset of asthmatic subjects, thus
identifying them as having this exclusive clinical presentation.
we refer to these patients as having aspirin-exacerbated
respiratory disease, a disease process that produces devastating
eosinophilic inflammation of both the upper and lower
respiratory tracts. this review focuses on a description of
patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, methods
available to diagnose their condition, the unique ability of all
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cox-1 to
cross-react with aspirin, an update on pathogenesis, and
current thoughts about treatment. (j allergy clin immunol

in 1922, widal et al published the first article describing the association of aspirin sensitivity, asthma, and
nasal polyposis. they also conducted the first aspirin
challenges and desensitization. this syndrome was not
widely recognized, however, until samter published 2 articles in the late 1960s and called the condition samter’s

triad (asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin reactions).2,3
most clinical investigators now include chronic hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis (ches)4 as a fourth hallmark
of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (aerd).5
many other terms have been used to describe this
respiratory disease: aspirin-induced asthma, aspirinsensitive asthma, aspirin hypersensitivity, aspirin idiosyncrasy, and aspirin intolerance. all terms refer to the
same patients who are afflicted with intractable inflammation in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts (nasal
polyps, ches, and asthma). exposure to aspirin does
not initiate or even perpetuate the underlying respiratory
inflammatory disease. however, once the disease is ongoing, aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids) induce release or synthesis of critical mediators, which then cause all of the clinical manifestations
of the characteristic respiratory reactions. the recent consensus nomenclature to describe aspirin-induced respiratory reactions is nonallergic hypersensitivity reactions.6

they have not ingested aspirin and other nsaids (usually
acetaminophen users). alternatively, they experienced
mild asthma attacks after ingesting nsaids but did not
correlate these events. in a large survey of pharmacyreported reactions to analgesics in asthmatic subjects, the
prevalence of aerd was listed as 3% in adults and 2%
in children.7 in large population surveys, using questionnaires to ask about asthma and aspirin inducing shortness
of breath or asthma attacks, the prevalence was 1.2%
(sample size, 4300),8 but the incidence of aspirin sensitivity was much higher in patients whose physician made a
diagnosis of asthma (8.8%). in a large population survey
in poland (12,971 adults), 4.3% of asthmatic subjects
identified themselves as reacting to aspirin with asthmatic
attacks.9 in perth, australia, in a survey of 516 asthmatic
patients and 1298 randomly selected individuals, the prevalence was reported to be 11% among asthmatic subjects
and 2.5% among the general population.10
investigators have performed prospective oral aspirin
challenges on various populations of asthmatic patients to
circumvent the problem of prior nonexposure to aspirin/
nsaids in asthmatic patients. during such aspirin challenge studies in adult asthmatic subjects, the incidence
of aerd has ranged from 10% to 20% in the pre-1990
literature.11-14 in a meta-analysis of 15 studies performed
after 1990 using oral aspirin challenges to detect aspirin
hypersensitivity in asthmatic populations, the combined
prevalence was 21% (ci, 14% to 29%), whereas in 5 studies in children (0-18 years) the combined prevalence was
only 5% (ci, 0% to 14%).7
when target populations of asthmatic subjects are
further stratified and include only those who also had
nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis, the prevalence of
aspirin hypersensitivity, discovered by means of prospective oral aspirin challenges, was found to be even higher,
in the range of 30% to 40%.11,15 in fact, the one study in
children that stands out as having a high incidence of positive oral aspirin challenge results (28%) was actually in
a population of teenagers who had nasal polyps, chronic
sinusitis, severe asthma, and a high prevalence of steroid
dependency.16 teenagers are probably more like adults
than prepubertal children with respect to being vulnerable
to acquiring aerd. the general experience is that aspirin/
nsaid hypersensitivity in preschool asthmatic subjects
is incredibly rare.
asthmatic patients who reported a history of aspirin- or
nsaid-induced asthma attacks (ie, believed they were
‘‘aspirin sensitive’’) experienced positive oral aspirin
challenges of 66%,13 84%,17 and 97%11 of the time in
these 3 studies. these observations point out the problem
of overdiagnosing aerd when relying on a history of
asthma after ingestion of aspirin or nsaids. in some patients a coincidence occurred in that aspirin or an nsaid
was ingested within 3 hours of the asthma attack, but the
2 events were unrelated to each other. the best histories
include ingestion of a therapeutic dose of any nsaid
that preferentially inhibits cox-1, followed by a severe
asthma attack requiring emergency intervention, an
nsaid-associated asthma attack at another time, or both.

natural history and clinical
presentation of aerd
consistent with a low prevalence of aerd in preteenagers, aerd is an acquired disorder with an onset of
symptoms beginning somewhere between the teenage
years and age 40 years. the average ages of onset were 34
and 29 years in 2 large studies involving 300 and 500
patients with aerd, respectively.18,19 there are more
female than male subjects who acquire this disease: in a
study of 300 patients from the united states,18 a 3:2 ratio
of female/male sex was found, whereas in europe19 a 2.3:1
ratio was found. there is no racial or ethnic predilection
for acquiring aerd. family histories of aerd are rare
and reported in 6% of patients in the european survey19
but in only 1% of patients in the us series.18
aspirin hypersensitivity can appear in patients who
already have allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma or any
other provoking factor for their asthma (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease, viral respiratory tract infections,
irritant inhalation, or exercise) or it can appear in patients
de novo who have never had any prior respiratory disease.
in a review of 103 german and polish patients with
aerd, 34% had positive skin prick test responses to
at least one aeroallergen.19 in the united states series
of 300 patients with aerd, the prevalence of positive
wheal-and-flare skin test responses was 64% but included
both prick and intradermal testing.18
the first clinical manifestation of aerd is usually
nasal congestion, but it might be superimposed on patients
who already have allergic rhinitis. many patients remember an upper respiratory tract viral infection as the inciting
event (‘‘my cold never went away’’). in 1988, szczeklik20
presented a theory that a viral respiratory tract infection
might be an inciting event that starts the inflammatory
cascade, leading to aerd in genetically susceptible individuals. another idea is that diesel exhaust and cigarette
smoke exposure, both of which contain polyaromatic
hydrocarbons, such as benzopyrene and phenanthrene,
stimulate respiratory epithelial cells to synthesize cytokines (il-1, il-6, il-16, and gm-csf), which drives a
th2 response.21-25 in an epidemiologic study a significantly higher prevalence of exposure to passive cigarette
smoke during childhood and young adult life was found
in patients with aerd when compared with their asymptomatic spouses, acting as control subjects (unpublished
data, j. martin and d. d. stevenson). hyposmia or anosmia occurs in most patients with aerd. in fact, normal
olfaction correlates with not having aerd.26
in aerd the original chronic rhinitis progresses to
ches with nasal polyposis. computed tomography or
plain radiography of the sinuses revealed opacifications in
99% of patients in one study.18 in this same study 94% of
patients with aerd had undergone at least 1 and averaged
3 prior sinus and polyp operations.18
asthma was either previously present in childhood and
young adult life (usually ige mediated) or begins de novo
between 3 months and up to 5 years (average, 2 years)
after onset of nasal congestion and polyposis.19 aspirin/

nsaid-induced hypersensitivity respiratory reactions can
appear at any time in the course of the disease, but until
such an event occurs, the diagnosis of aerd cannot be
considered. despite avoidance of aspirin and nsaids, mucosal inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts
persists and progresses. this strongly supports the fact that
ingestion of aspirin and the older nsaids exacerbate an inflammatory condition that is already active, rather than being responsible for inducing the disease in the first place.

respiratory reactions to aspirin
and nsaids
cross-reactions among the nsaids
that inhibit cox-1
patients with aerd react to aspirin, as well as all older
nsaids that preferentially inhibit cox-1 (table i),
inducing a spectrum of respiratory reactions, including
rhinitis and conjunctivitis, laryngeal spasm, and asthma
attacks.27-31 the reactions usually occur within 30 to 60
minutes after ingesting full therapeutic doses of aspirin
or nsaids but can occur up to 3 hours later, particularly
when patients are challenged with smaller aspirin doses
in the range of 30 to 100 mg. assuming that the doses
of nsaids are in the therapeutic range, cross-reactivity
among nsaids that inhibit cox-1 is 100% (table i).
in a study of 300 patients in the united states with
documented aerd, aspirin was the most commonly reported nsaid (80%) to elicit prior respiratory reactions,
followed by ibuprofen (41%).18 of the 300 patients, 36%
experienced 3 or more previous respiratory reactions to
aspirin and nsaids, indicating that a third of patients
had a significant delay in diagnosis. this suggested either
observational confusion on the part of the patients and
their physicians or insufficient education by health care
providers regarding avoidance strategies.18
partial cross-reactivity with poor
inhibitors of cox-1
 xxxd3163xxx  and acetaminophen are poor inhibitors of
cox-1 (table ii). however, at high doses, both can induce mild respiratory reactions in patients with aerd.
most patients with aerd can safely tolerate up to 500
mg of acetaminophen, but 28% experienced mild respiratory reactions to 1000 mg of acetaminophen, and another
6% reacted when doses were increased to 1500 mg.32 patients with aerd can take  xxxd3163xxx  in doses of less than
2000 mg.33 however, when 2000 mg was given to patients
with aerd, mild respiratory reactions occurred in 10% of
patients undergoing oral challenges with  xxxd3163xxx . when
reactions are elicited at higher doses of acetaminophen
and  xxxd3163xxx , they tend to be milder than those observed
with the older nsaids.
partial cross-reactivity with partially
selective cox-2 inhibitors
 xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2727xxx  (table ii) are 2 anti-inflammatory drugs that preferentially inhibit cox-2 at lower

and non-nsaids occur

concentrations but inhibit cox-1 at higher therapeutic
concentrations (ie, 15 mg of  xxxd2561xxx ).34-36 similar to
 xxxd3163xxx  and acetaminophen, respiratory reactions can
occur with higher doses of these 2 drugs and tend to be relatively mild.37,38 only  xxxd2561xxx  is available in the
united states, but both are available worldwide.

unusual cross-reactivity with selective
cox-2 inhibitors
selective cox-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib, celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx ,  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd2849xxx , and  xxxd2517xxx ,
are the most recent category of nsaids to enter and,
for some, to then exit the market (table iii). many
clinicians are apprehensive about prescribing selective
cox-2 inhibitors to patients with aerd because warning
labels on all coxibs list ‘‘aspirin triad’’ as a contraindication for prescribing these drugs. since 2001, well-designed
studies, however, demonstrated that selective cox-2
inhibitors, given in therapeutic dosages, have not crossreacted with aspirin or nsaids in any patients with
aerd participating in these studies.
in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, stevenson
and simon39 challenged 60 patients with aerd with rofecoxib. none of the patients reacted after ingesting 12.5
mg and 25 mg of rofecoxib. martin-garcia et al40 and
szczeklik et al41 conducted single-blind challenges in a
total of 52 more patients with aerd with up to 25 mg
of rofecoxib, and none reacted. woessner31 challenged
60 patients with aerd with even higher doses of rofecoxib (50 mg or 2 times the therapeutic dose), and again,
none of the patients had any adverse reactions. rofecoxib
has been withdrawn from the market.
celecoxib has also been studied in patients with aerd.
yoshida et al42 challenged 17 patients with aerd with
200 mg of celecoxib, and none reacted. woessner et al43

in which 60 patients with aerd were given 200 mg of
celecoxib, and none of the patients reacted. gyllfors
et al44 challenged 32 patients with aerd with 400 mg
of celecoxib, and again, none of the patients reacted.
furthermore, there was no increase in urinary leukotriene
e4 (ulte4) levels during celecoxib challenges, but the
usual increase in ulte4 levels occurred when the same
patients were challenged with aspirin.
 xxxd3481xxx  is also a cox-2 inhibitor that entered
and then exited the us market. woessner31 completed
a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 70 patients
with proved aerd. none of the patients had adverse
reactions to 20 mg of  xxxd3481xxx .  xxxd2069xxx  is another
highly selective cox-2 inhibitor and is available by prescription outside the united states. by experience, it has
been well tolerated by patients with aerd. in a recent
report from italy, 27 subjects with mostly urticarial and
angioedema reactions to nsaids, only 3 of whom had
aerd, underwent challenges with a new selective
cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd2849xxx .45 none reacted to  xxxd2849xxx ,
which is the first injectable coxib.  xxxd2517xxx  is another
coxib available outside the united states.46 we did not
find case reports of respiratory reactions to  xxxd2517xxx .
however, a word of caution; despite all of the safety data
and lack of cross-reactivity for use of selective cox-2
inhibitors in large numbers of patients with aerd, rare
case reports of respiratory reactions to selective cox-2
inhibitors have appeared in the literature. a most instructive
case was reported by baldassarre et al.47 they described a
45-year-old woman with aerd who experienced asthma
attacks by history after paracetamol (500 mg) and by oral
challenge after aspirin (10 mg) and celecoxib (15 mg). in
addition, during her respiratory reaction to celecoxib, her
ulte4 level increased from a baseline value of 368 to
1318 pg/mg creatinine. her unusual sensitivity to aspirin
(10 mg) is in contrast to the average aspirin provoking
dose of 60 mg (range, 30-100 mg), which is characteristic
of large numbers of patients with aerd undergoing oral
aspirin challenges.48 one of the authors of this review
(as) has recently worked with a 30-year-old woman with
aerd who had very high baseline ulte4 levels (40 times
the upper limit of normal). during oral challenges, she
reacted with bronchospasm after celecoxib and went into
anaphylactoid shock after aspirin. similar case reports for
celecoxib,49 rofecoxib,38,50 and etoricoxib51 make it impossible to take the position that coxibs never induce respiratory reactions in patients with aerd.

in vitro studies show that in supertherapeutic concentrations of these drugs,
weak inhibition of cox-1 occurs.

it is difficult to understand the mechanisms that might
account for the case reports described above. cox-2
inhibitors are designed with a side arm so that their
entrance into the smaller cox-1 channel is prevented by
the reduced size of the entrance and lack of a side pocket
within the enzyme.52 because of this feature, cox-2 inhibitors are between 5- and 50-fold more selective for
cox-2 over cox-1.53 therefore with very high doses
of selective cox-2 inhibitors, one could envision such a
high drug concentration around the mouth of the  xxxg1883xxx  enzymes that  xxxd208xxx  could not enter the channel. however, low to usual therapeutic doses of cox-2
inhibitors have participated in what on the surface appear
to be cross-reactions.47 we are not able to explain why
these rare reactions occur, but genetic differences in the
structure of the cox-1 channel would be interesting to
investigate.
some patients with aerd rarely experience respiratory, urticarial, and anaphylactic reactions through immune recognition of a specific cox-2 inhibitor.54 it is well
known that cox-2 inhibitors, like any of the nsaids, can
induce ige-mediated reactions.54-56 in other words, patients with aerd are not protected from experiencing
other types of specific immune reactions that have nothing
to do with inhibition of cox-1. whatever the mechanisms, as prescribing physicians, we can never guarantee
that patients will not react to a selective cox-2 inhibitor.
it seems logical to us to give the first full dose of a cox-2
inhibitor in the physician’s office to patients with aerd or
asthmatic subjects with unknown sensitivities. unfortunately, because of an increase in cardiovascular adverse
events, rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx  were withdrawn from
the world market. currently, the only remaining selective
cox-2 inhibitor in the united states is celecoxib. outside
the united states,  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd2849xxx , and  xxxd2517xxx 
are available (table iii).

diagnosis of aerd
the diagnosis of aerd can be definitively established
only through provocative aspirin challenges.26 there is no
reliable in vitro test, but the search for one continues.57,58
there are 4 types of provocation challenges, depending on

the route of administration and challenge drug: oral,26,59
inhalational,60-62 nasal,63-65 and intravenous.66
in the united states oral aspirin challenges are available.26 details for conducting these challenges can be found
in a prior reference.26 instead of starting with 30 mg of asa
during oral challenges, one can cut  xxxd234xxx  in half and
then a quarter and start with 20.25 mg of asa.
patients are instructed to continue oral and topical
corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, cysteinyl
leukotriene receptor antagonist 1 (cyslt1ra),  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor (5-loinh), and systemic corticosteroids because discontinuing these medications can lead
to an increase of hyperirritable airways. some medications should be discontinued 24 hours before challenge,
including antihistamines and short-acting inhaled b-agonists or anticholinergics. antihistamines can block upper
respiratory tract reactions to aspirin, which can interfere
with accurate identification of patients with aerd.67
use of short-acting b-agonists or anticholinergics can
lead to false-positive reactions because once the shortacting bronchodilator effect has disappeared, a rapid decrease in lung function can occur. if a decrease in fev1
is greater than 15%, diagnostic misinterpretation might
develop.68 cyslt1ra and 5-loinh do not block upper
airway reactions but do prevent or modify bronchospastic reactions during oral aspirin challenges.69,70
cyslt1ra shifts target organ responses from lower respiratory tract reactions to mostly upper respiratory tract
reactions.69
although not available in the united states, several
european centers use bronchial challenges with aspirinlysine.62,71 nizankowska et al62 studied the diagnostic
value of bronchial inhalation challenge with l-lysine–
aspirin in 35 patients with aerd who were suspected of
having aerd on the basis of a prior history of nsaid
reactions. thirty-one (89%) of 35 suspected asthmatic subjects experienced bronchospastic reactions during oral aspirin challenges. in the same patients, 27 (77%) of 35 or,
more accurately, 27 (87%) of 31 known reactors had bronchospastic reactions during inhaled aspirin-lysine challenges.
aspirin-lysine nasal challenges are also conducted in
europe and have a satisfactory diagnostic capability.63-65,72
in a recent study by micheletto et al,64 both asthmatic patients with aerd and aspirin-tolerant asthmatic patients
underwent nasal challenges with up to 25 mg of aspirinlysine. positive nasal responses and increased ulte4
levels occurred only in the patients with aerd. despite
increased synthesis of leukotrienes (lts), as measured in
ulte4, none of the patients with aerd experienced
asthma attacks during nasal challenges, despite significant
nasal responses. the major advantage of intranasal aspirinlysine challenges is avoidance of aspirin-induced bronchospasm. the disadvantages are that pure lower respiratory
tract reactors might not be identified, and in some patients
with aerd, occluding nasal polyps interfere with nasal
flow rates and make it impossible to perform the test.65 in
the united states a new diagnostic test for nasal challenge
using a dilute solution of ketorolac has recently completed
diagnostic trials.73 ketorolac solutions (8 mg/ml),

delivered as a nasal spray in increasing doses every 30 minutes, offer an alternative to aspirin-lysine nasal challenge in
the united states because aspirin-lysine has not been approved for use in human subjects by the us food and
drug administration.

pathogenesis
underlying respiratory disease (fig 1)
the pathophysiology of aerd has been partially
elucidated. nasal tissue biopsy specimens from patients
with aerd reveal extensive infiltration of eosinophils
and degranulated mast cells.74 bronchial biopsy specimens also contain increased numbers of eosinophils and
mast cells when compared with biopsy specimens from
patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma.75 why the eosinophils and activated mast cells infiltrate the respiratory mucosa in the first place is not clear and difficult to study
because any prior inciting events, such as viral infections
or exposure to air pollution and cigarette smoke, might
have occurred years earlier. nevertheless, once aerd appears, levels of proinflammatory cytokines synthesized by
epithelial cells and activated th2 lymphocytes are found
to be increased. these include il-2,  xxxg1177xxx , il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ,
il-13, gm-csf, and  xxxg354xxx .4,76-78 the cytokines  xxxg1177xxx ,
il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-13, and gm-csf all skew t-lymphocyte
responses toward th2, stimulate bone marrow precursor
cells, recruit eosinophils, and dramatically increase the
lifespan of eosinophils in vitro by inhibiting apoptosis.77
 xxxg1180xxx  and gm-csf are overexpressed in inflammatory cells
from mucosal biopsy specimens in patients with aerd.79
 xxxg354xxx  is also an important chemokine, the primary function of which is recruitment and activation of eosinophils,
as well as contribution to tissue damage through induction
of reactive oxygen radicals.80 ltc4, ltd4, and lte4 are
also chemotactic for eosinophils.81 mast cells contain
 xxxg1346xxx  hydrolase and therefore can covert  xxxg1346xxx  to ltb4,
which stimulates bone marrow to form mast cell progenitors and eosinophils.82  xxxg1347xxx  ( xxxg1347xxx ) converts
 xxxg1346xxx  to ltc4,82 thus activating this potent pathway.83,84
the end result is a striking increase in numbers of eosinophils and mast cells in the respiratory mucosa of patients
with aerd. activated eosinophils can also release cytotoxic molecules (eg, eosinophilic cationic protein, major
basic protein,  xxxg1964xxx , and  xxxg720xxx ), leading to respiratory mucosal inflammation and damage.85 despite identification of the above
mechanisms, none are restricted to patients with aerd. in
fact, these same inflammatory pathways and patterns can
be found in non–aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects with
nasal polyps and ches or in allergic asthmatic subjects.
there is clear evidence that most, but not all, patients
with aerd synthesize excessive amounts of lts, even
before any exposure to aspirin or nsaids.86 higher concentrations of ltc4 and thromboxane b2 were found in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from patients with
aerd compared with those seen in samples from control
asthmatic subjects and healthy patients.75,87 christie et al88

subjects with aerd did not identify an increase in polymorphisms for the flanking region of the gene encoding
for  xxxg1347xxx .92,93 not only is there overproduction of lts
in aerd, but sousa et al94 demonstrated that in asthmatic
subjects with aerd, but not in aspirin-tolerant asthmatic
subjects, nasal inflammatory cells expressed more  xxxg599xxx 
receptors. in patients with aerd, not only is there overproduction of lts, but more receptors are available to
receive these mediators.
 xxxd208xxx  is synthesized to 5-hydroxyperoxyeicosotetranoic acid by  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) and 5lipoxygenase–activating protein (flap), with synthesis
then proceeding down the  xxxg1346xxx  pathway or into the

alternative 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (hete) pathway. leukocytes and platelets synthesize a microsomal
enzyme called 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase,
which selectively converts 5-hete to 5-oxo-6,8,11,14ecosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ete).95 respiratory stress
and oxidative stress of polymorphonuclear cells activate synthesis or 5-oxo-ete, which is a potent chemoattractant for
pmns and eosinophils. although not specifically investigated in aerd, this proinflammatory mechanism might
also be active in aerd, the extent of which is currently
unknown.
just as overproduction of cyslts is the hallmark
of aerd, underproduction of lipoxins correlates with
having aerd.96 lipoxins are anti-inflammatory derivatives of  xxxd208xxx  and products of lipoxygenation.
they require 2 or more lipoxygenase enzymes for biosynthesis ( xxxg147xxx  and 15-lo). they are generated by transcellular cooperation and are functional antagonists of lts.97-99
therefore diminished capacity to generate lipoxin and
15-epimer lipoxin might contribute to uncontrolled and
protracted inflammation in patients with aerd.96,99 the
possible relationship between this phenomenon and the
accumulation of 15-hete after stimulation with aspirin
of peripheral leukocytes from patients with aerd100 is
interesting but needs further study.

prostaglandin (pg) d2, a mast cell–derived prostanoid
that is synthesized through the cox-1 and cox-2 pathways, is oversynthesized and secreted in asthmatic subjects with aerd.101  xxxg1073xxx  causes vasodilatation and
bronchoconstriction. it is also a potent chemoattractant
for eosinophils, operating through  xxxd14xxx  receptors [dp(2)] receptors on eosinophils.102,103 therefore in
patients with aerd, not only is there an increase in 5lo products, but certain prostanoids are also proinflammatory and tend to be oversynthesized.
a special role for pge2 in the pathogenesis of aerd
has been suggested.104 peripheral blood macrophage cells
(pbmcs) of some patients with aerd undersynthesize
pge2 at baseline.105 this places patients with aerd at
the disadvantage of lacking sufficient concentrations of
cellular or transcellular pge2 to stabilize mast cells and
slow synthesis of lts. there are 4 receptors for pge2,
e-prostanoid (ep) receptors 1 through 4. in one study single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the promoter
region of the gene encoding  xxxg1873xxx  were significantly
associated with aerd.106 thus decreased transcription
of the  xxxg1873xxx  for pge2 might render that subset of
patients with aerd unable to efficiently inhibit  xxxg147xxx 
and flap, even if they synthesized normal amounts of
pge2. nasal mucosal biopsy specimens from patients
with aerd, when immunostained for all 4 ep receptors,
showed a significant reduction in numbers of neutrophils,
mast cells, eosinophils, and t cells expressing  xxxg1873xxx  receptors but not ep1, ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors.107 another
study demonstrated a special role for ep3 receptors in suppressing allergic inflammation and suggested that patients
with aerd might depend more on the pge2- xxxg1874xxx 
pathway than do aspirin-tolerant asthmatic subjects and
healthy subjects.108 any of these discovered defects, under synthesis of pge2 or its  xxxg1873xxx  or ep3 receptors, diminishes the blocking capabilities of pge2 on  xxxg147xxx  and
flap or an inhibitory effect on mast cells.109
recently, several authors addressed the problem of
genetic polymorphism.110-114 the most comprehensive
study of genetic associations with aerd was published
by jinnai et al.106 using 370 snps from 63 candidate
genes, almost 200 patients with aerd were compared
with aspirin-tolerant asthmatic subjects and control subjects. a gene coding for ep receptor 2 was the only one
significantly associated with aerd. the investigators,
using 24 snps’ haplotypes, demonstrated that a region
located 11 kb upstream from the translation start of the
gene had the best correlation with the aerd phenotype.
a particular allele, 212 813a instead of g, in vitro had
diminished transcriptional activity when stimulated by
il-4 through the il-4 receptor– xxxg2217xxx  pathway. this finding recaptured
attention when ying et al107 demonstrated that inflammatory cells infiltrating the nasal mucosa of patients with
aerd were deficient in  xxxg1873xxx .
nearly a decade after the initial description of an
association between the hla dpb1 locus and aerd,112
these data were replicated by choi et al.111 despite a quite
different ethnicity (polish vs korean), the same allele,

stevenson and szczeklik 779

dpb1*0301, was overrepresented in aspirin-hypersensitive asthmatic subjects. thus an adaptive immune response
to mhc class ii antigens has probably occurred to mediate
at least a step in the development of aerd.
attempting to put this whole picture into perspective,
many of the inflammatory pathways described above are
also found in patients who have no reactions to aspirin
and other nsaids. however, one theme that runs
through most studies is that in patients with aerd,
measurements of cytokines, eicosanoid mediators (ulte4
and  xxxg1073xxx ), and  xxxg599xxx  receptors tend to group in the
high end of most study results. yet clearly separating individual asthmatic subjects with aerd from aspirintolerant asthmatic subjects cannot be accomplished on
the basis of their inflammatory profiles, including their
ulte4 levels, because of considerable overlap between
patients with aerd and aspirin-tolerant asthmatic subjects. to make matters more difficult, patients with
aerd can be mild, moderate, or severe in their clinical
disease presentation and their inflammatory profiles.86
despite these comments, a pattern is emerging in which
many defects in either overstimulation of inflammation
or underproduction of countermeasures, especially in
the eicosanoid family, is found in patients with aerd.
furthermore, a single genetic defect or promoter gene
that accounts for all patients with aerd has not been discovered. rather, some patients with aerd are upregulating  xxxg1347xxx , others are upregulating  xxxg599xxx  receptors, and
still others are oversynthesizing specific cytokines. at the
opposite end of the equation, some patients with aerd are
undersynthesizing lipoxins, pge2, or  xxxg1873xxx  or ep3 receptors. these facts would fit a theory in which multiple divergences in inflammatory pathways could occur in different
patients with aerd, yet rendering all patients vulnerable
to aspirin.

aspirin- and nsaid-induced hypersensitivity
reactions (fig 2)
in patients with aerd, acute respiratory reactions
induced by aspirin or nsaids encompass all the features
of immediate ige-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, yet
such a mechanism has never been demonstrated.54 this
fact is logical when one considers that all structurally distinct nsaids that inhibit cox-1 can cause respiratory
tract reactions in all patients with aerd on first exposure
to the new nsaid.27,28,115 thus drug hapten-antibody
recognition cannot be responsible for these reactions.3
when patients with aerd undergo aspirin challenges,
very substantial increases in ulte4 levels and decreases
in cox-1 products are recorded during bronchospastic
reactions86,88,116 or nasal responses.64 increases in ltc4
and histamine levels in both nasal117-119 and bronchial
lavage75 fluid after oral aspirin challenges in patients
with aerd, but not aspirin-tolerant control subjects,
have also been measured. as shown in fig 2, during aspirin-induced respiratory reactions, mast cells release histamine and tryptase and synthesize prostanoids ( xxxg1073xxx ) and
lts, and eosinophils secrete toxic molecules and synthesize lts.109,120

fig 2. aspirin or nsaids induced respiratory reactions. aspirin and nsaids inhibit cox-1, thus depriving
mast cells and eosinophils of pge2 to block the ongoing synthesis of lts. alteration in function of pge2 receptors (particularly  xxxg1873xxx ) might contribute to the inability of pge2 to sustain the blockade. from mast cells,  xxxg1073xxx 
is oversynthesized, and histamine and tryptase are released during reactions.  xxxg1965xxx 
(ecp) and major basic protein (mbp) are released from eosinophils. aa,  xxxd208xxx .

over the years, it has become clear that excessive
synthesis of lts in patients with aerd undergoing
respiratory reactions to nsaids or aspirin is secondary
to competitive inhibition or disabling of cox-1 enzymes
(fig 2).120 cox-1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme
that is present in most mammalian cells, including respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelial cells, as well as inflammatory cells. cox-2, by contrast, is only expressed in
inflammatory cells and is an inducible enzyme that is
highly upregulated by proinflammatory mediators, such
as cytokines, growth factors, and molecules coming
from tissue injury.120 when cox-1 is inhibited by aspirin
or cross-reacting nsaids, there is a rapid decrease in the
synthesis of cox-1 products, including pge2. in healthy
individuals and, to a lesser extent, patients with aerd,
pge2 inhibits  xxxg147xxx  and flap enzymes that otherwise
would generate potent proinflammatory mediators, such
as ltc, ltd, and lte4 and ltb4.
when cox-1 enzymes are inhibited by aspirin and
nsaids, the braking effects of pge2 are further reduced
or disappear, and  xxxg147xxx  is unopposed, allowing large increases in synthesis of lts.104 reduced pge2 synthesis
also results in decreased mast cell stability and increased
release of histamine and tryptase.109 during oral aspirin
challenges, when patients with aerd were pretreated
with inhaled pge2, they did not experience respiratory
reactions, and ulte4 levels did not increase.121,122 the
failure of cox-2 inhibitors to cross-react in patients
with aerd is further evidence that cox-2 enzymes do

not synthesize enough pge2 to make a difference in the
loss of pge2. this should not be surprising because the
small numbers of inflammatory cells synthesizing pge2,
when compared with the millions of cells expressing constitutive cox-1, all epithelial and endothelial cells of the
respiratory tract, makes inhibition of cox-2 a minor event
from the standpoint of available pge2. furthermore,
expression of cox-2 is diminished and its activity is
reduced in patients with aerd.123,124 the fact that  xxxd2561xxx  does not cross-react with aspirin in aerd with
low doses (at which cox-2 is inhibited) but does crossreact at high doses (at which cox-1 is inhibited) provides
further evidence that cox-1 inhibition is the key event in
the induction of aspirin/nsaid-induced respiratory reactions. finally, the defect of undersynthesizing pge2 or decreased transcription of  xxxg1873xxx  receptors for pge2 might
well render patients with aerd preferentially unable to
inhibit  xxxg147xxx  and flap when challenged with aspirin
or nsaids. this area of research is critical because
explaining why inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 in
healthy subjects or aspirin-tolerant asthmatic subjects
does not lead to the same respiratory reactions hinges on
as-yet-undiscovered fundamental defects unique to patients with aerd.
in addition to increased synthesis of lts, most patients
with aerd also have increased expression of  xxxg599xxx 
receptors on their inflammatory cells.94 thus not only is there
an absence of braking effects by pge2 and a surge of new lt
molecules, but the number of  xxxg599xxx  receptors on target cells

fig 3. aspirin desensitization. after aspirin disables cox-1 and cox-2, inflammatory cells are unable to
synthesize prostanoids, including the proinflammatory  xxxg1073xxx  and the anti-inflammatory pge2. histamine and
tryptase are no longer released from mast cells. eosinophils stop releasing toxic molecules. cyslt receptors
are underexpressed after aspirin treatment, and it is likely that intracellular transcription factors are also
inhibited by aspirin.

are also increased. this tips the equation toward a pronounced increase in end-organ responses to lts.125
lts are not the only mediators released or synthesized
during aspirin-induced respiratory reactions. nasal secretions obtained during aspirin-induced reactions contained
increased concentrations of histamine, tryptase, ltb4,
ltc4, and  xxxg1073xxx  and decreased concentrations of
pge2.117-119,126 the same is true for bronchial secretions
during aspirin-lysine–induced lower respiratory tract reactions.75  xxxg1073xxx  metabolites increase in serum samples
during aspirin-induced respiratory reactions.101 during
oral aspirin challenges, a minority of patients with
aerd have extrapulmonary reactions.54 in such patients
histamine and tryptase levels were found to be increased
in the systemic circulation.127

aspirin desensitization (fig 3)
aspirin desensitization is one of the most consistent
and least understood features of aspirin and asthma.
almost all patients with aerd can be desensitized to
aspirin and then take aspirin indefinitely to maintain their
desensitized state. during aspirin desensitization, ulte4
levels returned to baseline,86 and  xxxg599xxx  receptor levels
decreased significantly.94 at 2 weeks after daily treatment
with aspirin, 650 mg twice daily, ltb4 synthesis by peripheral monocytes also decreased significantly in patients
with aerd.128 a reduction in synthesis of ltb4 would be
therapeutically useful in reducing chemotaxis of eosinophils and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as well as mast

cell progenitors. ltc4 and histamine disappeared in
nasal secretions at the onset of aspirin desensitization.117
biochemically, we can measure specific changes that
downregulate inflammation and accompany aspirin desensitization. however, why aspirin desensitization occurs in
the first place continues to be a challenging question.

treatment
avoidance of aspirin and nsaids
and treatment of reactions
education of patients regarding complete avoidance
of cox-1 inhibitors is important. in particular, asthmatic
patients need to be vigilant when ingesting over-thecounter remedies that might include aspirin or nsaids
(eg, alka seltzer plus flu, which contains 500 mg of
aspirin). in addition, appropriate flagging of charts and
communication among health care professionals, including physician and pharmacy computers, is vital in preventing future inappropriate administration of cross-reacting
nsaids in those patients with aerd already given a
diagnosis. we are not advocating universal avoidance of
nsaids for all asthmatic patients. such a position denies
80% to 90% of asthmatic subjects access to these important medications. however, use of cox-2 inhibitors, extra
care, and thoughtful use of first-dose ingestion of  xxxg1883xxx  inhibitors in physicians’ offices might prevent some
inadvertent bronchospastic catastrophes. the major

782 stevenson and szczeklik

reviews and

danger of death from asthma in aerd is the first nsaidinduced reaction, particularly if this occurs far from a
medical facility.
depending on the severity, acute respiratory reactions
caused by accidental aspirin or nsaid ingestion are
treated with inhaled b-agonists by using multiple dosing
(5 inhalations, wait 5 minutes, and then keep repeating
inhalation treatments), antihistamines, systemic corticosteroids, and, if systemic histamine release is present,
intramuscular epinephrine. patients who experience laryngospasm respond rapidly to  xxxd2007xxx  administered by means of nebulization. some patients will
need more intense medical attention, including admission
to the intensive care unit, intubation, and mechanical
ventilation.

treatment of the underlying respiratory
tract disease
long-term control of both upper and lower airway
inflammation is the goal of treatment. high doses of
intranasal steroids are helpful in reducing inflammation
and retarding nasal polyp formation in some patients.129
during acute bacterial sinus infections, extended courses
of broad-spectrum antibiotics are frequently required.130
often patients will also respond to a 2- to 3-week burst
of systemic corticosteroids to aid in shrinking nasal polyps
and reestablishing temporary sinus drainage. a subset of
patients will gradually require continuous systemic corticosteroids. in a review of 300 patients with aerd, systemic corticosteroids were used as short courses in 134
(45%), on a daily basis in 95 (32%), and not at all in 71
(23%).18 unfortunately, as daily or frequent bursts of systemic doses of corticosteroids escalate, significant adverse
side effects also begin to accumulate.
 xxxd3554xxx  (a 5-loinh) and montelukast (a cyslt1ra),
are commonly used in patients with aerd, with variable
success. dahlen et al131,132 studied the effect of  xxxd3554xxx 
on the clinical course of 40 patients with aerd in a double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial and demonstrated efficacy. montelukast has also been studied in
a double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial in 80
patients with aerd, in which efficacy was also demonstrated.133 cyslt1ra treatment success is distinctly better in the carriers of the variant c allele of ltc4s134-137
and in individuals with the hla-dpb1*0301 marker.138
in our experience lt-modifier drugs are generally helpful
as adjunctive therapy. particularly in view of the fact that
aerd is largely the result of overproduction of cyslts,
the addition of a 5-loinh or a cyslt1ra to a baseline
of topical corticosteroids is now fairly routine treatment
for aerd. the use of both  xxxd3554xxx  and a cyslt1ra has
never been formally studied in patients with aerd but
is used by clinicians with anecdotal success.
in patients with aerd who are also atopic, treatment
of underlying allergic inflammation should also be maximized. allergen avoidance, antihistamines, immunotherapy, and anti-ige treatment should be strongly considered
as adjunctive treatment in patients with aerd with this
concomitant disorder. it does not make any sense to ignore

j allergy clin immunol

a concomitant disease, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma,
and conclude that aerd by itself is the only important
mechanism that is driving eosinophilic inflammation in
patients with both aerd and allergic respiratory disease. in
a study of 300 patients with aerd, two thirds had positive
wheal-and-flare skin test responses to relevant allergens.18
when maximal medical management of nasal polyposis
has failed, which is common, referral to a competent
otolaryngologist should be initiated. in fact, many patients
begin their medical journey with an otolaryngologist
because nasal polyps and anosmia are an early and devastating manifestation of the disease. nasal polypectomies,
resection of eosinophilic inflammatory tissue, and widening
of sinus ostia can be performed to help reestablish proper
drainage. in addition, at the time of surgery, specimens can
be sent for cultures and pathologic investigation, which can
be helpful in choosing appropriate antibiotic or antifungal
therapy. mcfadden et al139 followed 22 patients with
aerd who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery for
1 year. patients showed improvement in pulmonary function testing, need for topical and systemic corticosteroids,
and quality-of-life measures. kennedy140 reported that patients with aerd have the same long-term, postsurgical
outcomes as aspirin-tolerant patients, if they have the same
degree of mucosal disease. however, patients with aerd
as a group tend to have a larger burden of polypoid tissue,
and postsurgical regrowth of polypoid tissue remains a
significant problem.141 on average, reoperation for nasal
polyps is required every 3 years in patients with aerd.18,142

aspirin desensitization
aspirin desensitization is an effective yet underused
means of treating patients with aerd. almost all patients
with aerd can be desensitized to aspirin.143 once desensitized and maintained with daily ingestion of aspirin,
patients not only enjoy significant improvement in both
upper and lower respiratory symptoms but can also ingest
any of the cross-reacting nsaids without acute respiratory reactions.144,145 four long-term studies of patients
who underwent aspirin desensitization followed by daily
aspirin ingestion have demonstrated efficacy in reducing
upper airway congestion and nasal polyp formation and
improving lower airway asthma control.142,145-147 one
study involved 172 patients desensitized between 1995
and 2000 and treated with aspirin, 650 mg twice daily,
for 1 to 5 years.145 significant reductions in sinus infections and number of rescue oral steroid courses were observed, as well as improvements in anosmia, rhinitis, and
asthma symptom scores. of the 126 patients who completed a year or more of aspirin treatment, 87% experienced good or excellent improvement in their clinical
courses. in another study patients began to enjoy improvement in upper airway congestion as early as 4 weeks after
starting aspirin treatment.144
aspirin desensitization should be considered as add-on
treatment in patients with uncontrolled upper and lower
respiratory symptoms, patients requiring multiple polypectomies and/or sinus operations, patients requiring
unacceptably high intermittent or chronic systemic

corticosteroids, and patients requiring aspirin/nsaids for
treatment of other diseases, such as prophylaxis for coronary artery disease or postcoronary stent protection against
thrombosis and acute myocardial infarction.
performing aspirin challenges followed by desensitization is relatively safe.147 we are not aware of any published or unpublished reports of deaths during controlled
oral aspirin challenges. the risk of aspirin-induced asthma
can be significantly reduced by using pretreatment with
cyslt1ras.69,70 because the reaction severity is asa dose
dependent, the degree of respiratory reactions is almost
always smaller than the original reported aspirin/nsaidinduced reaction with full therapeutic doses of drug.
chronic aspirin therapy can result in well-known
adverse side effects in a minority of patients. in the most
recent scripps clinic study, 24 (14%) of 172 patients had
to discontinue aspirin therapy because of side effects: 14
had epigastric pain, 2 had gastrointestinal bleeding, 2 had
bleeding from the nose and ear, and 6 had aspirin-induced
urticaria.145 patients with a prior history of gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux might be at
higher risk for development of aspirin-induced gastritis, but
no prospective study of such patients has been conducted.

conclusion
aerd is a distinct clinical entity that is characterized
by aspirin-induced respiratory reactions, asthma, nasal
polyposis, and ches. if not recognized and treated
appropriately, aerd has the potential to cause significant
morbidity and even mortality, particularly when full doses
of aspirin or nsaids are ingested away from an acutecare medical facility. patients must be educated regarding
avoidance of aspirin and cross-reacting cox-1 inhibitors
to prevent potential life-threatening asthma exacerbations.
treatment of nasal polyp and sinus disease is also essential
to effectively control asthma, as well as to significantly
prevent secondary respiratory tract infections and improve
patients’ quality of life. aspirin desensitization should
be considered as add-on treatment for aerd in many
patients. hopefully,  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd2849xxx , and  xxxd2517xxx , new selective cox-2 inhibitors available in europe
and elsewhere, will find their way into the us market over
the next few years. further pharmacologic advances, such
as a new  xxxg147xxx  or flap inhibitor with improved pharmacokinetics might also be on the horizon.
