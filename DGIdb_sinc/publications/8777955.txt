abstract: we have previously demonstrated that the  xxxg92xxx  agonist,
salbutamol, potentiates the effect of  xxxd3054xxx  (il-4) on immunoglobulin e (ige)
production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc).
this study was undertaken to further define the activities of these drugs and the
role of cyclic- xxxd81xxx  (camp) in the modulation of ige production.
our results indicate that  xxxd2098xxx  (1 µm) potentiated il-4-induced ige production and ige messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) expression. moreover, this effect
was associated with an increase in intracellular camp levels. the activities of this
drug on ige production were mimicked by cell permeable camp analogues, such
as dibutyryl-camp (db-camp) (100 µm) or sp-amp (10 µm). the potentiating
effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on ige production was markedly inhibited in the presence of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) inhibitors: h8 (10 µm) and rp-amp (10 µm), suggesting that
its effects are likely to depend on the activation of the camp pathway. additionally,
the potentiating effect of  xxxd2098xxx  was also blocked in the presence of indomethacin.
 xxxd2098xxx  potentiated il-4-induced ige production from purified b-cells activated
through their  xxxg389xxx . this effect was associated with an increase in cellular viability. therefore, the activities of this drug on pbmc are likely to be mediated by the activation of another cellular type.
taken together, these results show that  xxxd2098xxx  potentiates the il-4-induced ige
production via the camp pathway, but that this enhancement could not be explained
by a direct effect on b-lymphocytes.

inhaled  xxxg92xxx  agonists are the most effective of the available bronchodilator drugs used to treat
asthma. they induce bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and are potent inhibitors of mediator release by
mast cells [1, 2]. however, despite this beneficial effect,
recent studies have suggested that the regular use of beta2adrenoceptor agonists in asthma has, controversially, been
claimed to lead to a further progression of the disease
[3, 4], and may be associated with increased morbidity
and even mortality [5]. indirect evidence also suggests
that beta2-adrenergic agonists play a role in the modulation
of immunity. for example, beta2-adrenergic stimulation of
lymphocytes produces changes in such parameters as tcell proliferation [6], antibody synthesis [7] and eicosanoid
production [8]. following the activation of the  xxxg92xxx , these drugs induce an enhancement of adenosine
3',5'-cyclic-monophosphate (cyclic-amp, camp) levels
[9]. this increase is followed by the activation of cytoplasmic camp-dependent  xxxg1836xxx  (pka), the
translocation of the kinase to the nucleus and ultimately
the phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors, such
as the camp response element-binding protein (creb)
[10]. thus, camp plays a key role in the regulation of
lymphocyte activation, but its effect depends on the cell
type, signals and stages of cell-cycle activation.

despite the clinical importance of immunoglobulin e
(ige) in allergic reactions, little attention has been paid
to the effect of  xxxg92xxx  agonists on the regulation of the production of this antibody. we have previously demonstrated that salbutamol potentiates the effect
of  xxxd3054xxx  (il-4) on ige production from human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), which might
be explained by an inhibition of interferon-gamma ( xxxg1141xxx ) production [11]. the same effect was observed in vitro and
in vivo in the mouse, where it could be associated with
an increased release of th2-type lymphokines from murine
splenocytes [12]. the present study was undertaken to
further characterize the effect of the  xxxg92xxx  agonist,  xxxd2098xxx , on human ige production. in addition,
the role of the intracellular camp level and pka activation was analysed.
methods
reagents
the following reagents were obtained as noted. recombinant human  xxxd3054xxx  (il-4, 1×107 u· mg-1) was
purchased from biotrans (los angeles, ca, usa). foetal calf serum (fcs), phosphate-buffered saline (pbs),

beta2- adrenoceptor agonist and i ge production

glutamine, penicillin and rpmi 1640 were from flow
(irvine, scotland).  xxxd2098xxx , n6,2'-o-dibutyryladenosine
3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (db-camp), indomethacin,
n-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide (h8), ortho-phenylenediamine (opd), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) and saline sodium phosphate ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (edta)
(sspe) buffer were purchased from sigma (st louis,
mo, usa). cholera toxin (ct) was from calbiochem
(la jolla, ca, usa). sp and rp-cyclic 3',5'-hydrogen phosphorothioate adenosine triethylammonium salt (sp- and
rp-amp) were from rbi (natick, ma, usa). purified
ige antibodies used as standards were obtained from
stallergenes (fresnes, france). purified mouse antihuman ige monoclonal antibodies (moabs) and anticd40 moabs were from pharmingen (san diego, ca,
usa). tween 20 was obtained from merck (darmstadt,
gfr). anti-cd20 moabs were from becton dickinson
(san jose, ca, usa).
isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
human pbmc were isolated from healthy nonatopic
donors by density gradient centrifugation on  xxxd3253xxx  (eurobio, les ulis, france). the cells recovered at the interface were washed twice by centrifugation at 1,800 rpm
in rpmi 1640, and were resuspended in a culture medium consisting of rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10%
fcs, 2 mm glutamine, 50 u· xxxg1167xxx  penicillin and 50
mg· xxxg1167xxx  streptomycin (rmpi-fcs) at a final concentration of 2×106 cells· xxxg1167xxx .
b-lymphocyte preparation
normal b-lymphocytes were purified from pbmc
according to the experimental procedure described by
miltenyi et al. [13]. pbmc resuspended in pbs solution containing 1% bsa plus 0.01% sodium azide plus
5 mm edta, were incubated with paramagnetic beads
(200 ml of the solution provided by the manufacturers
for 108 cells) conjugated to anti- xxxg375xxx  moabs. cells
were next deposited on specially designed columns and
separated into positive and negative populations using a
high magnetic field (miltenyi biotec, sunnyvale, ca,
usa). unlabelled  xxxg375xxx - cells were eluted from the column, whilst  xxxg375xxx + b-cells were recovered by vigorous
washing of the column matrix after its removal from the
magnet. after staining purified b-cell preparations with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated specific
anti-cd20 moabs (becton dickinson, moutain view,
ca, usa), fluorescence analysis was performed with a
facsstar+ (becton dickinson, sunnyvale, ca, usa)
and showed that they contained >98% b-lymphocytes.
b-lymphocytes were then resuspended in rpmi-fcs at
a final concentration of 1×106 cells· xxxg1167xxx  and were assessed
for viability by trypan blue exclusion after 13 days of
culture.
measurement of ige production
pbmc or purified b-lymphocytes were cultured for
13 days, after which supernatants were harvested and

221

tested for their ige concentrations. briefly, 96-well
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) plates
(maxisorp, nunc) were coated overnight at 4°c with 100
µ l·well -1 (10 µ g·ml -1) of anti-ige moab in 0.1 m
nahco3 buffer, ph 9.6. after five washes with pbs
added with 0.05% tween 20 (pbs-tween), the plates
were incubated for 1 h at 37°c with rpmi-fcs to saturate nonspecific protein-binding sites. one hundred
microlitres per well of culture supernatants or defined
solutions of ige standards was then added and the plates
were incubated for 2 h at 37°c. after washing the plates
five times with pbs-tween, 100 µl of 1/10,000 diluted
peroxidase-labelled anti-ige moab was added to each
well, and incubation was continued for 2 h at 37°c. after
five washes with pbs-tween, 100 µl of opd (0.5
mg· xxxg1167xxx ) in 0.1 m  xxxd1710xxx  and 0.1 m na2hpo4 buffer
was added. the reaction was stopped with 100 µl of
h2so4, and absorbance was assessed at 492 nm with an
elisa reader (dynatech, alexandria, va, usa). the
sensitivity of the assay was 300 pg· xxxg1167xxx . no cross-reactivity has been observed with others subclasses of antibodies.
ribonucleic acid (rna) isolation and northern blot
assays
total rna was isolated from pbmc using the method
described by chomczynski and sacchi [14]. aliquots of
rna (20 µg) were electrophoresed in 1% agarose, 6%
formaldehyde gels, electrotransferred to hybond n+ membranes (pharmacia, st-quentin en yvelines, france), and
fixed by uv irradiation. prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 68°c in a solution containing
0.5%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds), denhardt 5×, sspe
5×, dextran sulphate 5×, salmon sperm 20 µg· xxxg1167xxx  and
formamide 50%. hybridization was performed overnight
in a fresh solution containing a 32p-labelled rna probe
specific for the constant regions of the epsilon chain of ige
(cepsilon) (1×106 cpm· xxxg1167xxx ). the membranes were washed
for 30 min at room temperature in 1× standard sodium
citrate (ssc)/0.1% sds, and twice in 0.1× ssc/0.1%
sds at 68°c. they were then autoradiographed for 5
days at -80°c on rpn hyperfilm (amersham) using two
intensifying screens.
rna probe
in order to detect the ige mrna, a probe complementary to its sequence was constructed. a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cdna) corresponding to
a part of the ch2-ch4 domain of the cepsilon molecule was
obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) experiments using oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 228–244 and 830–846 of the
published sequence [15]. these oligonucleotides were
flanked by ecor1 and bamh1 sites to facilitate further
cloning. one milligram of total rna from the u266b1
cell line (kindly provided by g. delespesse, university
of montreal, montreal, canada) was reverse transcribed

o . coqueret, d . demarquay, v. lagente

using a commercial kit (promega, madison, wi, usa)
for 15 min at 42°c. cdna (5 ml) was then amplified
by 35 cycles of pcr at an annealing temperature of 65°c.
the pcr products were electrophoresed in tris-borate/
edta buffer and an expected band of 490 base pairs
(bp) was excised from the gel, purified out of agarose
(plasmid midi kit, qiagen, chatsworth, ca, usa) and
digested with ecor1 and bamh1 (stratagene, la jolla,
ca, usa). this dna was ligated overnight at 15°c
with pbluescript ii ks (-) (stratagene) treated with calf
intestine alkaline phosphatase. the xl1 blue bacteria
(stratagene) were then transformed with the ligation mixture. the white colonies obtained after blue/white selection were analysed for the presence of a 490 bp insert.
one "positive" clone was selected and partially sequenced
to confirm the presence of the insert using a commercial sequencing kit (applied biosystem, foster, ca,
usa). the plasmid containing the insert was then used
for in vitro transcription of a 32p-labelled riboprobe using
a commercial kit (stratagene).
determination of intracellular camp
a commercial radioimmunoassay (ria) camp-test
was used (nen, dreieich, germany). pbmc (2×106
cells· xxxg1167xxx ) were incubated in rpmi-fcs for 5 min with
the indicated stimuli, then harvested, washed in cold pbs
and incubated for 20 min in 0.1 m hcl at 4°c [16].

results
effect of il-4 and  xxxd2098xxx  on ige production and on
ige mrna expression
in earlier studies, we demonstrated that the  xxxg92xxx  agonist, salbutamol potentiates the effect of il-4
on ige production by human pbmc. this effect was
confirmed in this study by the experiments using  xxxd2098xxx 
and presented in figure 1.  xxxd2098xxx , which is ineffective in inducing ige production when added alone to the
cell cultures (<0.3 ng· xxxg1167xxx ), enhanced the ige production induced by il-4 in a dose-dependent manner, with
a peak effect observed at 1 µm.
to further investigate the mechanism underlying this
effect, northern blot experiments were conducted to
assess the effects of these drugs on ige mrna expression. results showed that il-4 (30 u· xxxg1167xxx ) induced the
appearance of a 2.2 kb productive ige mrna after 10
days of culture (fig. 2). when the cells were stimulated
with il-4 in the presence of  xxxd2098xxx  (1 µm), results
showed that this drug potentiated the effect of il-4 at
the ige mrna level. densitometric analysis of three

rna was isolated, size fractionated (20 µg·lane-1) and blotted onto a
nylon membrane. the membranes were hybridized with a 32p-labelled
rna probe specific for ige. the ethidium bromide staining pattern
of the membrane from which the northern blot was made shows equivalence of rna loading because il-4 was found to significantly inhibit the expression of  xxxg53xxx  mrna if means rna obtained from cells
stimulated with il-4 and  xxxd2098xxx  (1 µm). 28s and 18s are constant

the effect of the other camp-elevating agents on  xxxd3054xxx -driven ige production suggests that  xxxg92xxx 
agonists may mediate their effect through endogeneous
release of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) by monocytes. to
test this hypothesis, pbmc were preincubated with
indomethacin (10 µm) for 30 min and then stimulated
with il-4 and  xxxd2098xxx . no modification was observed
on the il-4-induced ige production (fig. 6). by contrast, indomethacin significantly inhibited (p<0.01) the
potentiating effect of  xxxd2098xxx  on ige production.
discussion
the results presented in this study indicate that  xxxd2098xxx 
and other camp analogues potentiate il-4-induced ige
production by human pbmc. these results were confirmed by the use of another  xxxg92xxx  agonist,
salbutamol (data not shown). to a lesser extent, the
same effect was observed on purified b-lymphocytes.
the enhanced ige production by pbmc seems to be
mediated through an increase of the productive ige mrna
expression. the transduction pathway for this potentiating effect depends on pka activation, since it is blocked by inhibitors of this kinase. moreover, the same
effect was observed when a direct activator of pka was
used. finally, the potentiating effect of  xxxg92xxx 
agonists is inhibited in the presence of indomethacin,
suggesting that their activities might be mediated through
a prostaglandin release.
the effect of  xxxg92xxx  agonists on human ige
production seems to be related to camp pathway, since
these drugs induce an increase in intracellular camp
levels. in the present study, this was observed only in
the presence of il-4. moreover, the cell permeable product db-camp, also potentiated the effect of il-4 on
ige production. thus, the potentiating effect of beta2adrenoceptor agonists might be explained by an interaction of camp at an unknown stage of il-4 signalling.
this notion finds support in a recent study suggesting a
cross-talk between the il-4 signalling pathway and pka
activation during human b-cell proliferation [17]. thus,
the il-4 and beta2-adrenergic signalling pathways may overlap one another after the activation of the kinase. this
notion is supported in recent studies showing that il-1
and camp induce immunoglobulin (ig) light chain transcription by activating the nuclear factor-kappab ( xxxg1559xxx )
protein [18].
although previous studies have suggested a direct effect
of camp on b-cell differentiation, we have no evidence
which cells among b-cells, t-cells and monocytes are

beta2- adrenoceptor agonist and i ge production

implicated in the modulation of ige production by camp.
 xxxd2098xxx  potentiates the il-4-induced ige production by
purified b-lymphocytes, but this effect seems to be related to enhanced cell viability. furthermore, the potentiating effect on ige production is less pronounced on
purified b-cells than on pbmc. thus, the modulation
of ige production by  xxxg92xxx  agonists is likely
to be mediated through another cell type, most likely tlymphocytes or monocytes. we have previously shown
that the enhanced ige production might be explained
by the inhibition of interferon-gamma ( xxxg1141xxx ) production by
pbmc [11]. the results presented in this study also suggest that the effect of  xxxg92xxx  agonists might
be explained by an enhanced release of pge2. this also
suggests that the effect of  xxxd2098xxx  could be explained
by the activation of monocytes. thus, further experiments are required to indicate whether or not the effect
of  xxxd2098xxx  could be explained by the release of prostaglandins. interestingly, it has been reported that pge2
potentiates the il-4-induced ige production by murine
b-lymphocytes [19].
since the concentrations used in this study are physiologically relevant, the present results suggest that exposure to  xxxg92xxx  agonists may profoundly influence
ige antibody production. in the presence of il-4, this
effect is associated with an increased intracellular camp
level followed by an activation of pka. moreover, the
present results suggest that the increased ige production
might be mediated by the activation of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway. given the clinical importance of these
drugs in the treatment of asthma, further studies are now
underway to determine whether  xxxg92xxx  agonists
exhibit the same effects in asthmatic patients.
