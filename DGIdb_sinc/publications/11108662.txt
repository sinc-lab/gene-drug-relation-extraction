role of multidrug-resistance protein 2 in  xxxg1073xxx  p1-1-mediated resistance to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide toxicities in hepg2 cells.  previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the phase iii efflux transporter multidrug-resistance protein (mrp)1 can act synergistically with the phase ii conjugating glutathione s-transferases (gst) to confer resistance to the toxicities of some electrophilic drugs and carcinogens. to determine whether the distinct efflux transporter  xxxg15xxx  could also potentiate gst-mediated protection from electrophilic toxins, we examined the effect of regulatable  xxxg996xxx -1 expression in  xxxg15xxx -rich hepg2 cells on 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4nqo)-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (nucleic-acid adduct formation). expression of  xxxg996xxx -1 was associated with a fourfold to tenfold protection from 4nqo-induced cytotoxicity. inhibition of  xxxg15xxx -mediated efflux activity by  xxxd3256xxx  or  xxxd1781xxx  completely reversed  xxxg996xxx -1-associated resistance-a result indicating that  xxxg996xxx -1-mediated cytoprotection is absolutely dependent on  xxxg15xxx  efflux activity. moreover,  xxxg15xxx  efflux activity also augmented  xxxg996xxx -1-mediated protection from 4nqo-induced nucleic-acid adduct formation. we conclude that  xxxg15xxx -mediated efflux of the glutathione conjugate of 4nqo and/or another toxic derivative of 4nqo is required to support  xxxg996xxx -1-associated protection from 4nqo toxicities in hepg2 cells.
