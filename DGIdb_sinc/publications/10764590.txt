nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that are
mediators of the action of lipophilic hormones and other endogenous
ligands and are the targets of drugs useful in a variety of therapeutic
areas. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)g is a nuclear
receptor that, acting as a heterodimer with rxr, mediates a variety of
cellular effects including adipocyte-differentiation. due to its role in modulating insulin sensitivity, it is the target of therapeutically active antidiabetic agents such as rosiglitazone. we have assigned the chemical
shifts of the backbone atoms of the 32 kda ligand-binding domain of
 xxxg1807xxx  in the presence of bound rosiglitazone. three-dimensional hnco
spectra of the apo ligand-binding domain (lbd) have less than half the
expected number of cross-peaks. the missing cross-peaks are restored
upon binding strong agonists such as rosiglitazone. the nmr results
indicate that the apo-lbd of  xxxg1807xxx  is in a conformationally mobile
state, and that agonist binding is associated with a marked stabilization
of the conformation. mapping the missing peaks to the 3d x-ray crystallographic structure indicates the region of mobility is extensive and
includes the ligand-binding region and the cofactor-binding site. this
leads to the conclusion that activation of this nuclear receptor is a result
of a population shift of a dynamic ensemble of conformations, rather
than a two-state switch from an inactive to an active conformation. our
results have important implications for the mechanisms by which antagonists, partial agonists, and agonists of nuclear receptor function operate.

lipophilic hormones and other endogenous ligands
and are the targets of drugs useful in a variety of
therapeutic areas (mangelsdorf et al., 1995). members of the nuclear-receptor superfamily bind as
hetero- or homodimers to dna response elements
and regulate gene transcription in association with
a variety of cofactors. dna-binding and ligandbinding functions are associated with separable
central and carboxy-terminal domains (leng et al.,
1995). data from differential protease sensitivity
and 3d crystallographic structure determination of
apo and ligand-bound states are consistent with
the existence of conformational changes occurring
upon binding agonists or antagonists to the ligandbinding domain (lbd) of nuclear receptors (allan

et al., 1992; berger et al., 1996; brzozowski et al.,
1997; wurtz et al., 1996). these conformational
changes have been proposed to play a crucial role
in the activation of nuclear receptors. furthermore,
conformational changes linked via interdomain
communication to phosphorylation of the aminoterminal domain have been proposed as an
additional regulatory mechanism (shao et al.,
1998).
here, we focus on the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar)g, a nuclear receptor that,
acting as a heterodimer with rxr, mediates a variety of cellular effects including adipocyte-differentiation.  xxxg1807xxx  is the target of therapeutically
active anti-diabetic agents such as rosiglitazone
(elbrecht et al., 1996; willson et al., 1996). recently,
mutations in human  xxxg1807xxx  were reported that are
associated with insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus
and hypertension, thereby conÂ®rming its role in
modulating insulin sensitivity as well as indicating
its importance in glucose homeostasis and blood
pressure regulation (barroso et al., 1999). here, we
show that the unliganded lbd of  xxxg1807xxx  is in a
conformationally mobile state and that agonist
binding is associated with a marked stabilization
of the conformation. our results have important
implications for the mechanisms by which antagonists, partial agonists, and agonists of nuclear
receptor function operate. because of the high
degree of structural similarity of the nuclear receptors, it is likely that conclusions reached for this
work will extend to other members of this important protein family.
assignment of chemical shifts
for the production of 15n, 13c, and 2h-labeled
hpparg lbd, bl21 cells (stratagene) hosting
pgexhpparglbd were grown on modiÂ®ed m9
minimal medium (maniatis et al., 1989) with 1 g/l
[15n]ammonium sulfate, 5 g/l [13c]glucose and
60 % 2h2o. adaptation of the bacteria to the medium was achieved by Â®rst culturing in 25 % 2h2o
medium at 37  c for 24 hours. the adapted culture
was grow to a600 Âˆ 0.7-1.0 at 37  c and induced
for overexpression by addition of iptg to a Â®nal
concentration of 0.1 mm at 18  c for 24 hours.
the cells were harvested by centrifugation for ten
minutes at 5000 g. the cell pellet was used for
gst-fusion protein puriÂ®cation following the recommended procedure from pharmacia biotech
using glutathione-sepharose beads. following
cleavage with thrombin, hpparglbd was further
puriÂ®ed using gel-Â®ltration chromatography in
20 mm k3po4 (ph 7.0), 50 mm kcl, 5 mm dtt.
the chemical shifts of the backbone atoms of
the lbd of  xxxg1807xxx , in a complex with the
ligand rosiglitazone (()-5-[[4-[2-(methyl-2-pyridinylamino)ethoxy]-phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidine
dione), were assigned using three-dimensional
nmr experiments. because of the largely helical
secondary structure characteristic of lbds of the
nuclear-receptor family (wurtz et al., 1996), and

ligand-induced stabilization of ppar

the relatively large size (31.5 kda), there was
extensive overlap of the spectral peaks. using a
perdeuterated and (13c,15n)-labeled sample of the
 xxxg1807xxx  lbd, however, it was possible to assign
approximately 95 % of the residues. assignment
of the backbone resonances was accomplished
with a suite of Â®ve three-dimensional nmr
experiments,
ct-hnca,
ct-hn(co)ca
(yamazaki et al., 1994), ct-hn(coca)cb, cthn(ca)cb (shan et al., 1996) and hnco
(muhandiram & kay, 1994) on 90 % fractionally
deuterated (13c,15n)-labeled protein. the experiments were assigned using semi-automated tools
in the program nmrview (johnson & blevins,
1994) and this will be the subject of a separate
publication.
samples for chemical shift mapping using nmr
spectroscopy were at a concentration of approximately 0.3 mm in a buffer consisting of 20 mm
k3po4 (ph 7.0), 50 mm kcl in 90 % h2o/10 %
2
h2o. nmr data were collected at 23  c on a
varian inova 600 nmr system equipped with a
varian triple-resonance 5 mm probe with a z-axis
gradient coil. the sample volume was 250 ml and
the nmr tubes were Â®tted with ultem susceptibility plugs (wilmad glass). all nmr spectra were
processed with nmrpipe (delaglio et al., 1995) and
analyzed using nmrview (johnson & blevins,
1994).
analysis of the chemical shifts of the ca atoms
and an analysis of preliminary assignments of the
nh-nh noes indicates that the secondary structure of the protein in solution is largely consistent
with that observed in the structures as determined
by x-ray crystallography (figure 1). in particular,
the ca shifts are consistent with the presence of a
helical conformation for both helix 20 , a helix that
is unique to  xxxg1807xxx  relative to other nuclear receptors, and for the crucial af2 region at the carboxy
terminus.
agonist binding restores missing peaks
the spectra of the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd in complex with
strong agonists such as rosiglitazone (and others
not shown) had approximately the correct number
of peaks for a protein of this size. spectra of unliganded  xxxg1807xxx  lbd, however, are markedly
different, in that they had signiÂ®cantly fewer crosspeaks than expected (figure 2). analysis of the
unliganded spectra identiÂ®es approximately 124
backbone cross-peaks as compared to the 265
expected and 270 observed with, for example, rosiglitazone. while many of the expected cross-peaks
are missing for residues of the apo-protein, multiple peaks are observed for some of the other residues of the apo-protein (figure 2(e) and (f)).
missing cross-peaks in nmr spectra can arise
from several different causes. for example, overlap
of cross-peaks corresponding to residues at the
``random coil'' chemical shift positions would
result in a smaller number of cross-peaks than
expected. this could arise from the free protein

being in an unfolded state or by proteolytic cleavage of the protein into small fragments. either of
these mechanisms should result in a number of
intense cross-peaks due to the high mobility and
superposition of multiple peaks at random coil
chemical shift positions. plots (not shown) of the
sorted intensities from the free and agonist-bound
samples indicate that whereas approximately ten
intense peaks are observed, the numbers and intensities of the more intense peaks are similar in the
two states. furthermore, the spectrum shown in
figure 2(b), was recorded on the same sample as
that of figure 2(a), after addition of ligand to the
free-protein, ruling out extensive proteolysis as the
source of the difference between the two spectra.
thus, the spectral differences are not a result of
signiÂ®cant changes in folding or proteolysis.
we have ruled out two other likely possible contributions to missing peaks. rapid amide proton
exchange at ph 7.0 could lead to loss of some
peaks, with a restoration resulting from a ph
change upon ligand addition. no ph change was
observed upon addition of ligand to the buffer.
furthermore, spectra of the apo-lbd at ph 6.5 did
not show an increase in peak number relative to
the sample at ph 7.0, whereas addition of rosiglitazone to the lower ph sample resulted in the
expected increase in peak number. thus, whereas
amide exchange rates may be higher in the more
conformationally mobile states, an effect of bulk
ph changes is not likely to contribute to the
observed phenomena. self-association may lead to
selective loss of peaks, even at concentrations well
below the kd (phul et al., 1999). the associationstate of the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd was measured by dynamic

light-scattering with a protein solutions dynapro
instrument. we showed that the apo- xxxg1807xxx  lbd
is monomeric at concentrations at least as high as
0.5 mm. in order to ensure that self-association
was not contributing to the selective loss of peaks,
we recorded an hsqc spectrum at 40 mm concentration at 20  c with a nalorac triple-resonance
8 mm probe and sample volume of 1000 ml. twodimensional hsqc spectra at this concentration,
which is more than tenfold below the concentration at which the protein was monomeric, did
not show an increase in peak number relative to
spectra at higher concentrations. addition of rosiglitazone to this dilute sample did, however, result
in the expected increase in peak number. selfassociation was not, therefore, a contributor to the
disappearance of cross-peaks in the spectra.
conformational dynamics explain
missing peaks
the most likely explanation for the spectral
differences is that the free protein is in a conformationally dynamic state. multiple conformations
are consistent with the fact that multiple peaks are
observed for some residues of the apo-protein.
motions between multiple conformations can
attenuate peak intensities in at least two different
ways. first, peak intensities are reduced by chemical exchange on an intermediate time-scale. if the
protein exists in two or more conformations with
differing chemical shifts, then interchange between
the states on a time-scale of the order of the frequency difference in the peaks will result in a
broadening of the peaks and their appearance at a
weighted average chemical shift position. if the

broadening is sufÂ®cient, the intensity will be in the
range of the noise and the peaks will be undetectable. secondly, the hnco experiments used here
for mapping the ligand-induced structural perturbations are susceptible to a related mechanism of
peak intensity loss. the hnco experiment consists
of a series of heteronuclear polarization transfer

steps, and chemical exchange during each polarization transfer step reduces the net polarization
transfer, and hence the intensity of the detected
signal (mulder et al., 1996; yamazaki et al., 1995).
the many missing cross-peaks in the spectra
suggests that the intensity loss due to chemical
exchange during polarization transfer is a primary

191

ligand-induced stabilization of ppar

cause of the absence of cross-peaks in the spectra
of the apo-protein.
the failure to observe many peaks in the spectrum is therefore most likely due to the existence
of the free protein in a conformationally mobile
state. because we cannot readily do experiments
on undetectable peaks, we have not quantiÂ®ed the
exchange rates with the standard nmr relaxation
experiments. motion on a time-scale of micro- to
milliseconds would, however, be consistent with
the results. in order to assess changes in the protein conformation, changes in peak positions were
monitored by calculating a weighted average of
the 1hn, 15n and 13c0 chemical shifts:

the average deviation between the positions of
assigned peaks in the free protein and the corresponding positions in the rosiglitazone bound protein is less than 0.05 ppm. this small value
indicates that the more stable regions of the protein
retain a conformation similar to that of the agonistbound form. furthermore, our own cd results (not
shown) and the ability to crystallize apo  xxxg1807xxx  in
a conformation similar to the canonical nuclear
receptor structure (nolte et al., 1998; uppenberg
et al., 1998) suggests that even though the free protein is mobile, the secondary structure and global
fold are largely preserved.

mapping mobility to the structure
since the chemical shifts have been assigned in
the ligand-bound form, it is possible to map the
residues that are conformationally mobile onto the
3d structure as determined by crystallography
(figure 3). as can be seen, a substantial portion of
the free protein does not give rise to observable
peaks in the hnco spectrum, indicating that a signiÂ®cant portion of the protein is conformationally
mobile. the borders of the ligand-binding site are
deÂ®ned by helices 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and af2, and the
small b-sheet (xu et al., 1999). the nmr data indicate that all those regions that sandwich the
ligand-binding site are conformationally mobile,
suggesting that ligand-binding provides binding
interactions that stabilize a large portion of the protein. we should note that internal association of
mobile and Â®xed regions might result in partial
overestimation of the extent of the mobile region.
as noted previously for the thyroid hormone
receptor, the absence of ligand from the binding
site results in the presence of a large cavity that is
uncharacteristic of globular proteins (wagner et al.,
1995). apparently, this destabilizes the folded state
of the protein and favors a more conformationally
dynamic condition. the cavity size in  xxxg1807xxx 
Ãª 3; nolte et al., 1998) is signiÂ®cantly larger
(1300 a
than that in the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx 
Ãª 3; wagner et al., 1995) and so the destabili(600 a
zation may be even larger.

192
population shifts of a dynamic ensemble
conformational changes upon ligand-binding
have been observed in other nuclear receptors as
well as in  xxxg1807xxx . the earliest indications of this
came from changes in proteolytic sensitivity, with
binding of ligands resulting in protection from proteolysis (allan et al., 1992; mcdonnell et al., 1995;
wagner et al., 1995). this led to the now widely
accepted belief that nuclear receptor activation is a
result of discrete conformational changes induced
by ligand-binding. subsequent studies of nuclear
receptors by x-ray crystallography indicated that
nuclear receptors could occupy distinct conformational states that are dependent on the ligation
state of the protein. for example, large differences
in the position of the af2 region between apo-rxr
and liganded  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar) forms of
the nuclear rxr (westin et al., 1998) suggest that
the conformational change of af2 upon ligation is
a molecular switch controlling activation. distinct
conformations of the af2 region between agonist
and antagonist-bound forms of the  xxxg730xxx  (brzozowski et al., 1997) are consistent with
such a molecular switch. the present study indicates, however, that ligand-binding does not
simply shift the conformation of the protein from
one distinct state to another. instead, it stabilizes
the protein from an ensemble of multiple conformational states to an ensemble with much reduced
populations in some of the conformational states
(freire, 1998).
crystallographic data suggest that different
states of the three-dimensional structure of nuclear-receptor lbds are correlated with different
ligand states. the multiple conformations seen in
crystal structures, for example the af2 helix in
apo- xxxg1807xxx  (nolte et al., 1998; uppenberg et al.,
1998), may result, however, from lattice-induced
stabilization of an intrinsically mobile structure.
furthermore, though the crystallographic b values
tend to be higher in the ``lower'' ligand-binding
region of the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd, there can be as much
difference in b values between monomers in the
asymmetric unit as there is between free and
ligand-bound form. for example, calculation of the
average b values for the ca atoms yielded values
Ãª 2 for the two molecules in the
Ãª 2 and 49 a
of 46 a
asymmetric unit of the crystal of apo-lbd (1prg),
Ãª 2 for the molecules in
Ãª 2 and 49 a
and values of 42 a
the asymmetric unit of the crystal of the lbd in a
complex with rosiglitazone and  xxxg1510xxx  peptide
(2prg). thus, the present nmr data provide a
clear indication, unavailable from the x-ray crystallographic data, that ligand binding to the  xxxg1807xxx 
lbd can be associated with signiÂ®cant changes in
conformational mobility.
changes in dynamics link ligand and
cofactor binding
these data have signiÂ®cant implications for
nuclear receptor function and the mode of action

ligand-induced stabilization of ppar

of different classes of nuclear receptor ligands.
transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors
involves the recruitment of a variety of cofactors.
for  xxxg1807xxx , one of these is cbp, the creb-binding
protein. by use of nmr perturbation techniques
we have determined the binding region for cbp on
 xxxg1807xxx  and validated it with mutagenesis studies
(chen et al., 2000), a result consistent with that
observed for src- xxxg1807xxx  interaction as determined
by x-ray crystallography (nolte et al., 1998). the
cbp- xxxg1807xxx  interaction site involves residues on
helices 3, 4, 5, and af2, and is shown by the present work to be conformationally dynamic. tight
binding of cbp to  xxxg1807xxx  probably requires
 xxxg1807xxx  to be in a conformationally restricted subset of the ensemble of conformations occupied in
the apo-protein, and this would result in a signiÂ®cant loss of conformational entropy upon formation of the complex. thus, variations in the
binding afÂ®nity for cofactor (zhou et al., 1998) may
be regulated by the conformational mobility of the
 xxxg1807xxx . in the model proposed here, agonist binding stabilizes the nuclear receptor, and thereby
uses ligand-binding interactions to compensate for
the entropic cost of protein stabilization so that
cofactor interactions do not need to do so. one
would expect the opposite to be true, and indeed
this was recently noted in the  xxxg730xxx ,
wherein the binding of coactivator peptides
decreases the dissociation rate of the protein for
agonists, but not for antagonists (gee et al., 1999).
we would expect that these antagonists do not
stabilize the protein structure to as great an extent
as the agonists. on the other hand, the partial
antagonist that was recently reported for  xxxg1807xxx 
(oberÂ®eld et al., 1999) probably provides a less limited stabilization of the protein structure.
mutations of the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd may further destabilize the protein, such that levels of endogenous
ligands do not stabilize the protein sufÂ®ciently to
allow cofactor binding and activation and thereby
lead to impaired function. this is probably the
mechanism for the recently reported human
mutations in the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd that lead to insulin
resistance, diabetes mellitus and hypertension
(barroso et al., 1999).
the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd joins a large variety of proteins
involved in transcriptional activation that have
high levels of conformational mobility (wright &
dyson, 1999). for example, the kid domain of
creb, which also interacts with cbp, is disordered
in the free state but orders upon binding to cbp.
in this case, the entropic cost of stabilization is
apparently compensated by enthalpic interactions
made possible by phosphorylation of the kid
domain (radhakrishnan et al., 1997). it is likely
that these dynamic processes play a crucial role in
transcriptional activation. for example, as discussed above for  xxxg1807xxx , the conformational mobility can play an important role in regulating signal
transduction via thermodynamic control of the
binding interactions involved in the multiple
protein cofactors that regulate the transcriptional

ligand-induced stabilization of ppar

machinery. conformational dynamics serves in this
case to provide the allosteric linkage between
ligand-binding and cofactor binding. the large
area of  xxxg1807xxx  stabilized by ligand binding may
provide detailed control over the afÂ®nity of  xxxg1807xxx 
with cofactors such as cbp and allow for Â®ne tuning of the interactions such that different levels of
activity are possible, depending on the nature of
the cofactor and ligands, and their concentrations.
the large area of  xxxg1807xxx  that is mobile also raises
the possibility that other, unidentiÂ®ed, cofactors
involved in transcriptional regulation may interact
with regions of the protein besides the cbp-binding site. another possible role for conformational
mobility in regulating transcriptional activity could
occur through regulation of protein concentration
via modulation of sensitivity to the cellular proteolytic machinery (wright & dyson, 1999). finally,
dynamics around the region of the ligand-binding
site may be important in facilitating access to the
ligand-binding site, as previously suggested by
nmr results for other proteins (e.g. see hodsdon
& cistola, 1997) and investigated by computational
simulations for the rar (blondel et al., 1999).
here, we have shown for the Â®rst time that
nmr spectroscopy can be used to directly map the
3d structural dynamics of nuclear receptor lbds
in solution, providing insight into their mechanism
that is not obscured by crystal lattice contacts.
binding of a potent agonist was associated with
marked stabilization of the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd conformation. we envision that different classes of tightly
bound ligands could provide various degrees of
stabilization of the protein. depending on the
degree of stabilization (and speciÂ®cally the extent
to which stabilization affects the co-activator binding interface), discrete compounds would act as
antagonists, partial agonists or full agonists
towards transcriptional activation and downstream
biological effects.
