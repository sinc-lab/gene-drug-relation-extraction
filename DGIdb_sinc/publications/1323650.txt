s 14671: a naphtylpiperazine 5-hydroxytryptamine1a agonist of exceptional potency and high efficacy possessing antagonist activity at 5-hydroxytryp...  the interaction at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) receptors of the novel naphtylpiperazine, s 14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoylamino)ethyl]-4[1-(7- methoxynaphtyl)]piperazine), was compared to that of the 5-ht1a ligands, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-oh-dpat), wy 50,324 [n-(29(4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)tricyclo(3.3.1.1(3,7) )- decane-1-carboxamide], (+)-flesinoxan, buspirone and bmy 7378 [(8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- 1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspirol[-4-]-decane-7,9-dione 2hcl]. s 14671 showed a very high affinity for 5-ht1a sites (pki, 9.3) as compared to the reference ligands (pki values, 9.2, 8.7, 8.7, 7.9 and 8.7, respectively). s 14671 bound in an apparently competitive manner and, in distinction to the reference compounds, possessed a hill coefficient (1.4) significantly superior to 1. although showing low affinity at 5-ht1b and 5-ht3 sites, s 14671 displayed significant affinity at both  xxxg1115xxx  and 5-ht2 sites; pki, 7.8 in each case. furthermore, s 14671 acted as an antagonist of 5-ht-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in rat choroid plexus ( xxxg1115xxx ) and cortex (5-ht2). in vivo, upon s.c. administration, s 14671 acted as a high efficacy agonist in models of  xxxg1108xxx -mediated activity: induction of flat-body posture, spontaneous tail-flicks, hypothermia and corticosterone secretion and inhibition of morphine-induced antinociception. in every test, s 14671 was the most potent compound: it was active at doses as low as 5 micrograms/kg s.c. relative potency across all tests was s 14671 greater than 8-oh-dpat greater than wy 50,324 greater than (+)-flesinoxan greater than buspirone with bmy 7378 too weak for comparison to be meaningful. the action of s 14671 in 5-ht1a tests was blocked by bmy 7378 and the 5-ht1a antagonist, (-)- xxxd123xxx , but unaffected by the  xxxg1115xxx /2 antagonist, ritanserin, and the 5-ht3 antagonist, ondansetron. activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors was confirmed in 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-lesioned rats, in which the potency of s 14671 to elicit spontaneous tail-flicks was potentiated. activation of presynaptic receptors was demonstrated by inhibition of the electrical activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus with the following order of relative potency: s 14671 greater than 8-oh-dpat greater than wy 50,324 greater than bmy 7378 greater than buspirone. spiperone, which acts as a pure 5-ht1a antagonist at raphe 5-ht1a receptors, blocked the action of s 14671. in conclusion, s 14671 is a structurally novel ligand manifesting high efficacy and exceptional potency at both pre- and postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors.(abstract truncated at 400 words).
