abstract a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)4 receptor agonist, tks159, {4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxyn-[(2s,4s)-1-ethyl-2-hydroxymethyl-4-pyrrolidinyl] benzamide}, has recently been developed as a gastroprokinetic drug.  xxxd1708xxx  is already used clinically to
increase gastric contractions. the stimulatory effects
of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  on gastric contractions were
examined using force transducers chronically implanted on the vagally denervated pouch (heidenhain
pouch) and the vagally innervated main stomach in
conscious dogs. contractile activity was analysed by
computer and expressed as a motor index. intravenous
administration of tks159 or  xxxd1708xxx  signi®cantly
increased the motor index in both the main stomach
and the heidenhain pouch during the fed and fasted
states. pharmacological characterization in the fasted
state revealed that the contraction-stimulating activity of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  on the stomach was signi®cantly inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium and
a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist, sdz 205±557. granisetron (a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist) signi®cantly inhibited  xxxd1708xxx -induced, but not tks159-induced
gastric contractions. the plasma motilin concentration was signi®cantly increased after  xxxd1708xxx , but
not after tks159 injection. in conclusion, tks159 has
a contractile-stimulating effect on both the innervated
and the denervated stomach. it is likely that a cholinergic pathway and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are involved in
producing the contractions, although other mechanisms cannot be excluded.  xxxd1708xxx  has almost the
same characteristics, but the present ®ndings suggest
the involvement of motilin and 5-ht3 receptors in the
effects of  xxxd1708xxx .

introduction
gastric contractile activity can be classi®ed into two
distinct patterns: the interdigestive state and the digestive state. during the interdigestive state, gastric
motility in the dog follows a characteristic pattern.1
phase iii in the stomach is the phase of maximal activity as compared with other phases in the cycle and
consists of a grouping of two to three contractions, at
least one of which is of large amplitude, recurring at 1±
3 min intervals. phase i is a quiescent period following
phase iii, while phase ii consists of intermittent contractions of smaller amplitude than those during phase
iii.2 phase iii contractions occurring in the stomach
migrate along the small intestine. this characteristic
interdigestive state is disrupted by feeding and is replaced by the digestive state.1 the digestive state is
characterized by regular rhythmic contractions.
gastroparesis is a syndrome characterized by gastric
stasis leading to dilation of the stomach in the absence
of mechanical obstruction, and is now recognized as a
frequent cause of upper gastrointestinal symptoms
such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting and early satiety.
such motor dysfunction can be effectively treated with
prokinetic agents that facilitate gastric motility of the
stomach, e.g. metoclopramide3 and  xxxd1708xxx .4 these
agents exert their effects through several mechanisms
of action. for instance, metoclopramide has been reported to activate the intramural cholinergic neurones
responsible for modifying gastric motility,5 to enhance
gastric emptying through an antidopaminergic effect6
and to increase acetylcholine (ach) release from nerve
terminals.7  xxxd1708xxx  has been shown to enhance endogenous ach release without affecting dopamine receptors8 and to stimulate gastric motility via a
mechanism involving 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)4
receptors.9 renzapride10 and mosapride11 produce

neurogastroenterology and motility

gastric pouch, which was introduced by heidenhain,16
is now widely used to study gastric secretory and motor activity. brie¯y, the stomach and spleen were exposed in the surgical ®eld, and a portion of the greater
curvature just opposite to the splenic hilum was converted into a pouch with an adequate blood supply
from the gastroepiploic artery intact. the stomach was
reconstituted, and the pouch was closed. the pouch
was drained through a chronically implanted cannula
that exited through the left lateral abdominal wall.
because this pouch was completely separated from the
main stomach, it was deprived of its vagal innervation.
force transducers17,18 were sutured onto the seromuscular layer of the pouch and the gastric antrum (3 cm
proximal to the pyloric ring). the lead wires of the
transducers exited through skin incisions between the
scapulae, and the outer ends were ®xed onto the skin
incisions with silk sutures. after the abdominal surgery, a silicon tube (inside diameter  1.02 mm, outside diameter  2.16 mm, 602±205, dow corning
corp., midland, mi, usa) was inserted into the superior vena cava through a branch of the right external
jugular vein. the tube was ®lled with heparinized saline and closed with a tiny plastic plug, and the outer
end was secured onto the neck skin with silk sutures.
this tube was used for intravenous administration of
the test materials.
after the operation, a jacket protector was placed on
the dog to protect the lead wires and jugular tube, and
the dogs were housed in individual experimental cages.
they were maintained with an intravenous drip infusion of  xxxd3213xxx  lactate solution for ®ve post-operative
days, and were then gradually returned to a regular diet
of dog food (20 g dry pellets kg)1 body weight, gaines
meal, ajinomoto-general food corp., tokyo, japan)
which was fed at 17:00. drinking water was given
freely. all experiments were begun about three weeks
after surgery.

contractile activity similar to  xxxd1708xxx  in the upper
gastrointestinal tract through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.
tks159 is a novel benzamide derivative, 4-amino-5chloro-2-methoxy-n-[(2s,4s)-1-ethyl-2-hydroxymethyl
-4-pyrrolidinyl] benzamide (fig. 1), which has been
developed by teikoku chemical industries co., ltd,
osaka, japan. a recent study found that tks159 enhances the electrical transmural stimulation-evoked
contraction and release of endogenous ach through 5ht4 receptors in the guinea-pig stomach.12
gastrointestinal motor activity in conscious dogs is
quite similar to that in man,13 and drugs that stimulate
contraction in the canine gastrointestinal tract usually
elicit a similar response in humans. accordingly,
measurement of contractile activity in conscious dogs
is useful in evaluating the contraction-stimulating
effects of drugs. in the present study, the contractionstimulating activities of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  were
studied in conscious dogs by chronically implanting
force transducers in the vagally denervated and innervated stomach. the pharmacological properties of
tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  were then analysed in vivo using
various antagonists.

methods
preparation of animals
six healthy mongrel dogs weighing 12.1  1.8 kg were
used in the present study. the procedures followed
were approved by the review committee on animal
use at gunma university, maebashi, japan. the dogs
were anaesthetized with a single intravenous injection
of thiopental sodium ( xxxd3354xxx , tanabe pharmaceutical
co. ltd, osaka, japan; 20 mg kg)1 body weight), and
general anaesthesia was maintained by intratracheal
inhalation of halothane ( xxxd2261xxx , takeda chemical
industries ltd, osaka, japan) and oxygen. the abdominal cavity was opened, and a vagally denervated
pouch (heidenhain pouch) was constructed according
to a previously reported method.14,15 this denervated

measurements and analysis of contractile
activity
the cable leads from the ampli®ers (ug-6, nihon kohden kohgyo co. ltd, tokyo, japan) were connected to
the lead wires from the transducers in a pocket attached to the jacket protector. signals from the ampli®ers were recorded on a pen-writing recorder (me175d, nihon kohden kohgyo co. ltd) at a paper speed
of 1 mm min)1. the traces from the pen-writing recorder were mainly used for inspection of the contractile pattern, for instance, to determine the timing
of injections of test materials. contractile activity
(motor index) was analysed using our own program on

figure 1 chemical structure of tks159 (4-amino-5-chloro-2methoxy-n-[(2s,4s)-1-ethyl-2-hydroxymethyl-4-pyrrolidinyl]

tks159 and gastric contractions

a personal computer (pc-9801 rx, nec inc., tokyo,
japan). analog signals from the transducers were converted to digital signals through an analog to digital
converter at every 100 ms with a resolution of 12 bits.
the motor index was then calculated by summation of
the area under the curve for a given period, i.e. as a
function of both duration and amplitude, and was expressed in motor units. one motor unit means that
50 g are loaded on a strain gauge force transducer for
1 min. to check the program, the areas under the curve
on tracings obtained with the pen recorder calculated
manually were compared with the results obtained by
computer analysis. the results of both were well correlated.
phase i is a quiescent period for gastric motor activity during the interdigestive state. therefore, vehicle, tks159, or  xxxd1708xxx  was administered during
phase i, and 20-min motor indices were calculated after
the injection. during the digestive state, 20-min motor
indices were calculated after injection of vehicle,
tks159, or  xxxd1708xxx , with the pre-injection 20-min
motor indices being taken as 100%, because contractions of regular amplitude and frequency continue.
each phase was determined by visual inspection
using the criteria of sarna2 (see the introduction).

renergic receptor antagonist),  xxxd2621xxx  (a 5-ht1+2
receptor antagonist), granisetron (a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist) and sdz 205±557 (a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist) were administered by continuous intravenous
infusion for 30 min. dopamine was used in this study
because it acts on the dopamine-d2 receptors on parasympathetic postganglionic neurones in the stomach
to inhibit ach release.19,20 dopamine was also given
as a continuous infusion. tks159 (1.0 mg kg)1) or  xxxd1708xxx  (0.3 mg kg)1) was then given as a single bolus
10 min after the start of antagonist administration.
saline infusion was used as a control, and the motor
index in the main stomach for the control 20 min after
the administration of 1.0 mg kg)1 tks159 or
0.3 mg kg)1  xxxd1708xxx  was taken as 100%. the doses of

 xxxd2621xxx  (2.0 mg kg)1 h)1 infusion) and granisetron (0.3 mg kg)1 h)1) were determined from our previous studies in conscious dogs.21,22 the dose of sdz
205±557 was determined on the basis of previous in
vivo studies.23,24 the experiments with antagonists
were carried out only during the interdigestive state,
because the phase i period of this state is quiescent in
terms of motor activity, thus allowing the motor
stimulating activity of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  to be
characterized. the doses of 1.0 mg kg)1 tks159 and
0.3 mg kg)1  xxxd1708xxx  were adopted, because these
doses were found to stimulate gastric contractions in
the main stomach signi®cantly.

experimental procedures

activity in the vagally innervated and denervated
stomach in order to observe the stimulatory effects of
tks159 on the stomach in the digestive state, tks159
was given as a single bolus intravenous injection 2 h
after feeding. in the interdigestive state, tks159 was
given during the phase i period, 10 min after the end of
phase iii contractions in the main stomach. the doses
of tks159 tested in this study were 0.3, 1.0 and
3.0 mg kg)1.  xxxd1708xxx  was used as a control drug at
doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg)1. for each agent 1 ml
of the solvent (2% lactic acid) was used as a vehicle
control.

effects of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  on the plasma motilin
concentration the effects of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  on

implanted on the gastric antrum were prepared. after
phase iii contractions were con®rmed to have occurred,
blood samples were taken at 5-min intervals. vehicle,
tks159 (1.0 mg kg)1), or  xxxd1708xxx  (0.3 mg kg)1) was
administered intravenously 10 min after the termination of spontaneous phase iii contractions. collection
of blood samples was continued for 20 min after the
test materials had been injected.

discussion
the main aim of the present study was to investigate
the contraction-stimulating activity of tks159 in the
stomach and to compare it with that of  xxxd1708xxx  in
conscious dogs. both drugs had a stimulatory effect on
gastric contractions. in the interdigestive state, both
drugs induced gastric contractions during the phase i
period when motor activity is quiescent. in the digestive
state, enhancement of gastric motor activity by tks159
consisted of an increase in the amplitude of existing
contractions but did not affect contraction frequency,
and this effect was not different from that of  xxxd1708xxx .
another aim of this study was to determine whether
tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  are effective in the vagotomized
stomach. the heidenhain pouch is a vagally denervated pouch created by transecting the entire wall of
the stomach, and is widely used as a substitute for the
vagotomized stomach, although sympathetic innervation along the gastroepiploic vessels remains intact.
there have been few studies examining the effects of
pharmacological agents, including  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists, on contractile activity in the heidenhain
pouch. schiavone et al.26 reported that  xxxd1708xxx  and

(2.0 mg kg)1 h)1), propranolol (2.0 mg kg)1 h)1), or  xxxd2621xxx  (1.0 mg kg)1 h)1). pre-treatment with granisetron
(0.3 mg kg)1 h)1) signi®cantly inhibited  xxxd1708xxx -induced

tks159 and gastric contractions

tivity by indirect mechanisms that facilitate ach release, mediated by postganglionic nerve endings in the
myenteric plexus of the gut.4 a previous study showed
that tks159 stimulates ach release from the neurones in the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig stomach.12 it therefore seems likely that tks159-induced
contractions in the main stomach are also mediated by
ach release from these post-ganglionic neurones, despite the species difference. this hypothesis is supported by the results of pre-treatment with dopamine,
which is known to suppress gastric motility by inhibiting the release of ach from nerve terminals via the
stimulation of dopamine-d2 receptors.19,20 moreover,
because pre-treatment with hexamethonium, a nicotinic receptor antagonist, signi®cantly inhibited
tks159- and  xxxd1708xxx -induced contractions in the
main stomach, nicotinic transmission also appears to
be involved in the pathway. however, the inhibitory
effects by these agents may be due to functional antagonism. therefore, an additional experiment is necessary to prove the involvement of a cholinergic
pathway. with regard to adrenergic receptors, tks159
and  xxxd1708xxx  are a-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and
the involvement of a-adrenergic receptors in their effects on gastric motility cannot be excluded on the
basis of the study. however, it seems that noradrenaline release from noradrenergic neurones is not involved in these effects, as pre-treatment with
 xxxd2914xxx  and propranolol had no effect on
tks159- and  xxxd1708xxx -induced contractions.
the involvement of 5-ht receptors was studied
using three different 5-ht receptor subtype antagonists:  xxxd2621xxx  as a 5-ht1+2 receptor antagonist,
granisetron as a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist and sdz
205±557 as a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist. although the
receptors for  xxxd2621xxx  have not been clearly de®ned, this agent had no effect on tks159- and  xxxd1708xxx -induced
contractions
in
the
stomach.
interestingly, granisetron had no effect on tks159-induced gastric contractions, but signi®cantly inhibited
those induced by  xxxd1708xxx .  xxxd1708xxx  is also known to
act as an antagonist of 5-ht3 receptors, but the af®nity
of  xxxd1708xxx  for  xxxg1117xxx  receptors is 10 times higher than
that for 5-ht3 receptors. therefore, a dose of
0.3 mg kg)1 may have little effect on 5-ht3 receptors
in vivo. in addition,  xxxd1708xxx  often induced phase iiilike gastric contractions, whereas we previously reported that  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists inhibit spontaneous and motilin-induced phase iii contractions.29,30
therefore,  xxxd1708xxx -induced contractions might be
modi®ed by endogenous motilin release. in fact, the
motilin level was signi®cantly higher after intravenous
injection of  xxxd1708xxx  during this study. it is possible

figure 7 effects of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  on plasma motilin.
the peak value represents the mean value of the motilin
concentrations during the spontaneous phase iii contractions.
the plasma motilin level at 5 and 10 min after the injection of
 xxxd1708xxx  was signi®cantly higher than after the vehicle control. tks159 did not affect the plasma motilin level. each
value represents the mean  se for ®ve dogs. *p < 0.05 vs
vehicle control.

more, bingham et al.23 reported that 5-ht stimulated
contractile activity in the heidenhain pouch, and that
this could be reversed with the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists sdz 205±557 and sb 204070. tks159
was found to be capable of stimulating contractile activity in the heidenhain pouch at the same dose that
enhanced contraction in the main stomach. this suggests that tks159 may have a bene®cial effect on the
hypomotility in the stomach of vagotomized patients.
recent clinical investigations,27,28 however, have reported no bene®cial effect of  xxxd1708xxx  on delayed gastric emptying in vagotomized patients.
in the present study, the pharmacological characterization of tks159 was examined only in terms of its
contractile activity during the phase i period of the
interdigestive state, because this period, particularly in
the stomach, is quiescent with regard to motor activity. during the digestive period, ingested food in the
stomach stimulates gastric contractions in various
ways, and this would conceal any mechanism by
which tks159 enhances gastric contractions. as
shown in the present study, 1.0 mg kg)1 tks159 and
0.3 mg kg)1  xxxd1708xxx  induce a signi®cant increase in
gastric contractile activity, therefore these doses were
used for the pharmacological study. tks159- and  xxxd1708xxx -induced contractions in the stomach were
completely inhibited by pre-treatment with the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine.  xxxd1708xxx  has
been reported to stimulate gastrointestinal motor acó 1998 blackwell science ltd

that when  xxxd1708xxx  induces motilin release, the contractions become phase iii-like and therefore more
likely to be inhibited by a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist.
in the present study, the  xxxd306xxx  sdz 205±557
was used as a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist. this compound has been reported to be 30 times more potent at
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the isolated guinea-pig ileum than
ics 205±930, but to be 100 times less potent than ics
205±930 as a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist.31,32 in this
study, sdz 205±557 was infused continuously at a
dose of 6.0 mg kg)1 h)1, because the half-life of its inhibitory activity is only 23 min.24 however, this large
dose may block 5-ht3 as well as  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.
therefore, although sdz 205±557 greatly inhibited
 xxxd1708xxx -induced contractions in this study, this
strong inhibitory effect may be due to combined
blockade of both 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. in contrast with this in vivo study, de ridder and
schuurkes33 reported that  xxxd1708xxx  stimulated contractions in canine longitudinal muscle strips with a
myenteric plexus through a 5-ht receptor other than
5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht3 or  xxxg1117xxx . on the other hand,
tks159-induced gastric contractions were signi®cantly inhibited by sdz 205±557, but not by granisetron. in
a recent in vitro study, matsuyama et al.12 described
how tks159 enhanced the electrically evoked release
of [3h]ach from the guinea-pig stomach in a concentration-dependent manner with an ec50 value of
0.3 lm. this enhancement was antagonized by 10 lm
sdz 205±557, but, as in this study, the inhibitory effect of sdz 205±557 was incomplete. these ®ndings
suggest that the motor-stimulating activity of tks159
in the stomach is not mediated through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors alone. however, most of the data on the pharmacological properties of sdz 205±557 in the literature
have been obtained from in vitro experiments. in addition, although statistically signi®cant differences
were determined by fisher's protected least-squares
difference method, this method does not correct for
type i errors. therefore, it is dif®cult at present to draw
any de®nite conclusions regarding the pharmacological
characteristics of tks159 and  xxxd1708xxx  from the experiments carried out with sdz 205±557. several new
selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists have been developed recently, and further study in this area is expected.
in conclusion, tks159, a novel benzamide derivative, is capable of stimulating contractile activity in
the stomach. it is likely that a cholinergic pathway and
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors are involved in producing the contractions, although other mechanisms cannot be excluded.  xxxd1708xxx , known to be a prokinetic agent, has
almost the same characteristics, but the present ®nd-

ings suggest the involvement of motilin and 5-ht3
receptors in the effects of  xxxd1708xxx . as tks159 and
 xxxd1708xxx  also stimulate the vagally denervated stomach, these agents may have the potential to stimulate
the hypomotile stomach in vagotomized patients.
