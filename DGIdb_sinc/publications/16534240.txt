abstract
in the present study the effects of intravenously administered  xxxg517xxx  (crh) on the release of  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) derivatives such
as  xxxg1801xxx  (acth), -lipotropin (lph) and -endorphin (-end) as well as direct effects
of crh on pain sensitivity were examined. in 16 healthy
volunteers we studied the effects of 100 g intravenously administered crh in absence or presence of 12 mg
naloxone on heat or pressure pain sensitivity, using a
double-blind, cross-over and placebo-controlled design.
to evaluate analgesic effects of crh via release of
pomc derivatives, we determined plasma concentrations of -end-immunoreactive material (irm), authentic -end (-end(1–31)) and -lph irm, in parallel with
heat and pressure pain tolerance thresholds before and
15 and 30 min after treatment with crh (or placebo), and

5 min after naloxone (or placebo) administration which
was administered 40 min after crh (or placebo) injection. crh increased levels of -end irm, -end(1–31)
and -lph irm. as compared to -end irm levels measured by a commercial ria kit, the -end(1–31) levels
determined by a highly specific two-site ria, proved to
be remarkably small. furthermore, crh did not induce
increases of heat pain tolerance thresholds, but of pressure pain tolerance thresholds, which, however, were
not reversible by naloxone. neither -end nor -lph
irm nor -end(1–31) levels correlated with heat or pressure pain tolerance thresholds. we conclude that crh
does not modulate heat, but pressure pain; pomc derivatives like -end irm, -end(1–31) or -lph do not
mediate this effect.

introduction

in mammals, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(hpa) axis is activated in response to stress. various
stimuli provoke the hypothalamic release of  xxxg517xxx  (crh), which stimulates pro-

opiomelanocortin (pomc) gene expression and release
of pomc derivatives such as  xxxg1801xxx  (acth), -lipotropin (-lph) and -endorphin (-end) into the cardiovascular compartment.
since stress has been shown to produce analgesia [1], the
analgesic effect of crh has been studied and in fact has
been demonstrated frequently [2–9], whereby the analgesic effects might have been elicited by crh itself [4, 6,
7], by -end [2, 3, 5] or by further compounds released
upon activation of the hpa axis. in fact, crh by itself
may produce analgesia via immune cell-mediated mechanisms [7, 10], but these mechanisms cannot explain
crh-induced analgesia as demonstrated in the tail ﬂick
[4] or the hot-plate tests [2, 5] apparently not related to
inﬂammatory processes.
to our knowledge, there is only one clinical study
which demonstrates analgesia due to intravenous administration of crh [2]. in several reports, -end, released
into the cardiovascular compartment upon postoperative
pain [e.g. 11] or angina pectoris [12], has been claimed to
be responsible for analgesic effects observed under these
conditions; however, naloxone has not been tested for a
reversal of this effect. therefore, the present study was
designed to evaluate whether -end might be able to
produce naloxone-reversible analgesia upon intravenous
crh administration in humans. furthermore, we evaluated plasma levels of authentic -end(1–31) and -lph,
the precursor of -end, also released in the cardiovascular system under stress in response to pain [13] for a potential correlation with heat or pressure pain tolerance
thresholds.
several reports indicate that separate classes of primary afferent ﬁbers may be differentially activated by
various stimuli (thermal, mechanical or chemical) [14,
15]. in line with these ﬁndings, some agents may separately reduce the pain induced by a certain stimulus without altering pain induced by another one. further, -opioid receptor-deﬁcient transgenic mice showed increased

sensitivity in response to heat, suggesting the existence of
a -opioid receptor-mediated reduction in thermal nociception [16, 17]. cogan and spinnato [18] found that
pressure pain tolerance thresholds of pregnant women
increased during the last 10 days of pregnancy, suggesting
an involvement of endogenous opioids. as yet, there is
no clinical study which has explored inﬂuences of crh
on mechanically induced pain. in the present study we
therefore used heat and, in addition, pressure pain stimuli to evaluate effects of crh, -lph and -end(1–31)
on pain perception with or without opioid receptor blockade by naloxone in two different pain models.

methods
participants
the prospective study was approved by the ethics committee
of the university of giessen (medical faculty). written consent to
participate in the study was given by 16 healthy participants (for
characteristics, see table 1). exclusion criteria were all kinds of
painful syndromes, hyperresponsiveness to stress, mental disorders, neuropathies, use of hormonal contraceptives, strong smokers
as well as endocrine disorders. all participants studied were drugfree and were instructed not to drink caffeinated beverages, or to
use products containing alcohol or nicotine for 24 h before the start
of any session.
procedures
in 16 healthy volunteers we studied the analgesic effect of intravenously administered crh (100 g) on experimental heat and
pressure pain sensitivity; naloxone (12 mg) was intravenously injected 40 min after crh administration to test for an opioid mechanism of the analgesic effect. to search for an involvement of
pomc derivatives released into the cardiovascular compartment
in the analgesic effect, we looked for correlations between pomc
derivative concentrations and sensitivities to heat or pressure pain.
we determined plasma concentrations of -end-immunoreactive
material (irm), authentic -end(1–31) and -lph irm as well
as heat and pressure pain tolerance thresholds at four different
times: before administration of crh or placebo (saline 0.9%) (time
ta), and 15 (time tb), 30 (time tc) and 45 min (time td) after treat-

ment with crh (or placebo). primarily, the present study was
planned with a crh dosage of 300 g. the ﬁrst 3 participants
showed side effects like facial ﬂushing and tachycardia; thus, the
blind control design failed and the present study was carried out
with a crh dosage of only 100 g such as used in previous studies
[2, 19, 20]. the dosage of naloxone was around 100-fold higher than
used for reversal of an opioid overdose and was lower than dosages
with side effects of naloxone [21]. the timing of crh and naloxone
administration was chosen considering their pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic properties [19, 21].
the study utilized a cross-over design with a double-blind control. all the participants were assigned randomly to take part in
four sessions at 1-week intervals: one session with administration
of 100 g crh (immediately after ta) and 12 mg naloxone (10 min
after tc) (session i: crh/naloxone), one with administration of
100 g crh (immediately after ta) and placebo (10 min after tc)
(session ii: crh/placebo), one with administration of placebo (immediately after ta) and 12 mg naloxone (10 min after tc) (session
iii: placebo/naloxone) and one only with administrations of placebos (immediately after ta and 10 min after tc) (session iv: placebo/
placebo).
all the sessions started at the same time of day (ca. 17:00 h) with
the insertion of an indwelling forearm catheter in the left median
basilic or cubital vein, while participants were in a comfortable supine position. a sphygmomanometer cuff was placed around the
upper right arm. the participants were allowed to relax and to
spend the rest of any session in that position. after 30 min of relaxation the ﬁrst blood sample was drawn and the measurements
of heat and pressure pain tolerance threshold (see below) followed
(ta). immediately after measurement of the pain tolerance thresholds, 100 g crh or placebo (saline 0.9%) were injected through
the forearm catheter. 15 min (tb) and 30 min (tc) after crh (or
placebo) infusion, blood samples were taken and measurements of
the pain tolerance thresholds were conducted. 40 min after treatment with crh, 12 mg naloxone or placebo (saline 0.9%) was injected through the forearm catheter. 5 min after the naloxone or
placebo injection, blood sampling and the measurements of heat
and pressure pain tolerance thresholds were conducted again, i.e.
45 min after treatment with crh or placebo (td).

plasma extraction
the extraction of test and standard plasma samples was conducted as described previously [22]. in brief, the samples were
thawed at 4 ° c, centrifuged (5 min, 8,000 g) and 5-ml acidiﬁed
plasma aliquots were passed at 4 ° c through sep-pak c18 cartridges (waters, milford, mass., usa), which had been activated
before with 5 ml methanol followed by 5 ml urea (8 mol/l) and
10 ml water (bidistilled, 4 ° c). the cartridges were then washed
with 10 ml acetic acid (4% in water) and 10 ml water. elution of
the pomc derivatives from the cartridges was achieved with 10 ml
 xxxd3026xxx  with 4% acetic acid (96/4 v/v). the organic solvent contained in the eluate was evaporated at room temperature using a
speed vac concentrator (savant, new york, n.y., usa). after
adding 0.5 ml bidistilled water the remaining aqueous phase was
lyophilized, the residue was reconstituted on ice in 0.5 ml buffer 1
(see below), and 100-l aliquots – referred to as ‘extracts’ (see below) – were frozen at –80 ° c until further analyses.

pain tolerance measurements
for the assessment of heat pain sensitivity, a thermal stimulator
was used which consisted of a temperature-controlled peltier contact thermode with a stimulation surface of 2.5 ! 2.5 cm2, mounted on the right volar forearm. the apparatus included a thermal
controller with a microcomputer for managing the temperature
(precision: 80.05 k) and was connected to a personal computer to
control the procedures. the temperature of the thermode started at
37 ° c (baseline) and increased (0.25 k/s from baseline). the participants were instructed to press a button if the heat pain became
unbearable. then, this maximal temperature of the thermode was
immediately saved, within a few seconds the temperature of the
thermode decreased to 37 ° c. in preliminary experiments it was
shown that three trials were necessary to get a coefﬁcient of variation !5%; thus, three trials were carried out at each time; the mean
of the maximal temperatures of the three trials was regarded as the
heat pain tolerance threshold.
pressure pain was induced with pressure from the automatic
inﬂation of an electronic sphygmomanometer placed around the
upper right arm. using the ascending method of limits, pressure

human -lph and with 125i-labeled -lph(37–58), i.e. -msh (in

participants were instructed to press a button if the pressure pain
became unbearable. immediately after pressing the button this
maximal pressure (80.1 kpa) was saved and the cuff was deﬂated.
in preliminary experiments, ﬁve trials were carried out each time
to get a coefﬁcient of variation !5%; the mean of the maximal pressure values of the ﬁve trials was regarded as the pressure pain tolerance threshold.

plasma sample collection
12 ml blood was taken from a forearm catheter, mixed with
150 l ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) (0.08 g/ml), immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 1,000 g (15 min at 4 ° c).
approximately 2 ml plasma was used to determine -end irm.
two 5-ml plasma aliquots were acidiﬁed, each with 0.5 ml hcl
(1 mol/l). all samples were immediately frozen and stored at 20 ° c
until extraction. for assay standardization, -end(1–31) or
-lph was added to edta-plasma samples from up to 3 healthy
volunteers in concentrations of 0.33, 1, 3.3, 10, 33, 100 and
1,000 pmol/l. these plasma standard samples were treated exactly
like test samples.

statistical analyses
for descriptive statistics, minimum and maximum values as
well as ﬁrst, second and third quartiles of the pomc derivative
concentrations as well as heat and pressure pain tolerance thresholds were calculated. analytical statistics were performed using the
wilcoxon signed rank test for non-parametric data. the signiﬁcance
of differences between plasma concentrations and pain tolerance
thresholds at different times was examined calculating hodgeslehmann estimators (ˆ ) associated with wilcoxon’s signed rank
statistics followed by a bonferroni correction [27]; the level of signiﬁcance was set at the two-sided 95% conﬁdence interval (ci) for
ˆˆ. to estimate differences between concentrations and pain tolerance thresholds, hodges-lehmann estimators, ˆ b–a,ˆˆc–b as well as
ˆ d–c, were calculated. concentration or pain tolerance threshold
differences signiﬁcantly different from zero are indicated by a 95%
ci limited by two negative or two positive values; one of the two
values was also allowed to be zero.
the data determined prior to the crh administration at ta were
entered as baseline values. the responses to crh, placebo or nal-

oxone were calculated as the net areas under the plasma concentration curves (aucpomc derivative). in order to obtain these values, ﬁrst
the area under the response curve was calculated by integrating the
times on the abscissa and the dependent variables on the ordinate
as measured over all times. then a second area was calculated by
using only the y value measured at ta (baseline value prior to crh,
placebo or naloxone administration) for integration over all measured times. finally, the second area was subtracted from the ﬁrst
one.
spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcients were calculated for
analysis of interrelationships between pain tolerance thresholds
and plasma concentrations of pomc derivatives at ta, tb, tc or td
as well as auc of pomc derivatives from ta to tb, ta to tc or ta
to td.

release of -lph and -end into the
cardiovascular system
for all four sessions (i–iv) the levels of -lph irm,
authentic -end(1–31) and -end irm determined in
venous blood plasma were condensed to box-and-whisker
plots of minimum and maximum values as well as ﬁrst,
second (medians) and third quartiles of the concentrations (ﬁg. 1–3). in addition, signiﬁcances of concentration
differences, evaluated using hodges-lehmann estimators and wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, were
listed.
intravenous administration of 100 g crh induced a
signiﬁcant increase of -lph, -end irm and end(1–31) plasma concentrations as observed 15 and,
moreover, still 30 min after injection of crh (tb, tc) in
comparison to basal levels at ta (sessions i and ii in ﬁgures 1–3). as expected, in sessions iii and iv the release
of pomc derivatives into the cardiovascular compartment did not increase after infusion of the placebo. correspondingly, the net areas under the concentration curves, auc-lphirm, auc-end(1–31) and
auc-endirm from ta to tb, ta to tc or ta to td in sessions
i and ii were signiﬁcantly larger than in sessions iii and
iv (data not shown).
no signiﬁcant correlation between the concentrations
of -end irm and the concentrations of -end(1–31)
was found (rnichols®, 3e7/11p = 0.08; p = 0.77). in contrast,
a signiﬁcant correlation between the -lph irm concentration, measured using the 93e ria, and the -end
irm concentration, was found (rnichols®, 93e = 0.51; p =
0.04).

free labeled peptide, the samples were incubated together with charcoal and subsequently centrifuged to remove charcoal-adsorbed
peptide. containing antibody-bound labeled and non-labeled peptide in amounts dependent on the amount of non-labeled peptide
in the samples, the supernatants were analyzed for radioactivity in
a gamma counter for determination of antibody-bound labeled peptide.
authentic -end(1–31). a ﬂuid-phase two-site immunoprecipitation ria as described previously was used to determine end(1–31) in plasma extracts [13, 23, 24]. in brief, a monoclonal
mouse antibody (code 3e7), directed against the n-terminus of end (yggf), and a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (code 11p), directed against the c-terminal fragment of -end (kkge) were
used. the monoclonal mouse antibody (3e7) was radioactively labeled with iodine-125 (125i) using published techniques [22, 25];
the iodination product was incubated with charcoal for 15 min on
ice for puriﬁcation, the suspension was centrifuged at 8,000 g
(5 min) and the supernatant containing the 125i-labeled antibody
(3e7) was stored at 4 ° c.
for the assay, plasma extracts were thawed at 4 ° c and incubated together with the labeled antibody (code 3e7) and rabbit
antiserum (code 11p). a ‘125i-3e7/-end/11p’ complex was
formed if samples contained -end(1–31). the complex was immunoprecipitated by a goat antiserum directed against rabbit immunoglobulin (igg). the immunoprecipitate was centrifuged; the
radioactivity measured in the pellet indicated the amount of precipitated -end(1–31). this two-site immunoprecipitation ria
proved highly speciﬁc for -end(1–31). -lph, fragments of
-end, e.g. - or -endorphin, -end(1–27), n-acetylated endorphins, des-tyr--ends or  xxxg1801xxx  did not cross-react (all
cross-reactivities !0.001% [see 23]) with this assay. the intra- and
interassay coefﬁcients of variation were 3.7 or 3.8%, respectively.
the detection limit varied between 2 and 5 pmol -end(1–31)/l
plasma and was determined separately for each assay.
-end irm. additionally, the levels of -end irm were
quantiﬁed by a commercially available immunoradiometric assay
(nichols®, san juan capistrano, calif., usa). the detection limit
of the assay was 4 pmol/l. cross-reactivity with des-tyr--end
and n-acetyl--end irm, also present in human plasma [13, 26],
was 100% and with -lph 16%, respectively.

pain tolerance thresholds
the data of pressure and heat pain tolerance thresholds are given in ﬁgures 4 and 5. no changes of the heat
pain tolerance thresholds were observed after administration of crh (sessions i and ii), naloxone (sessions i and
iii) or placebo (sessions iii and iv) (ﬁg. 5). in contrast, a
signiﬁcant increase of the pressure pain tolerance threshold 15 min after crh administration (at tb) was observed
in sessions i and ii, whereas no changes of pressure pain
tolerance thresholds were seen after administration of
placebo and/or naloxone (sessions iii and iv). naloxone
(sessions i and iii) did not reverse pressure pain tolerance
thresholds which were still signiﬁcantly elevated at tc as
compared with basal levels at ta (ﬁg. 4). neither concentrations of pomc derivatives after crh administration
at tb nor net areas under the concentration curves
(auc from ta to tb and from ta to tc) in sessions i and
ii correlated with the heat or pressure pain tolerance
thresholds. furthermore, alterations of pomc derivative levels (cpomcderivalive(tb – ta) = cpomcderivative(tb) –
cpomcderivative(ta)) after crh administration did not correlate with alterations of pressure pain tolerance thresholds either (e.g. session i:
rc-end(1–31)(tb – ta),  pressure pain threshold (tb – ta) = 0.07, p = 0.8;
further data are not shown).

the crh-induced increase of the pressure pain
tolerance threshold is not -end(1–31)-mediated
the results of this study show that the intravenous administration of 100 g crh did increase pressure pain
tolerance thresholds. however, changes in concentration
of pomc derivatives, -end irm, -end(1–31) and
-lph were not related to alterations of pressure pain
sensitivity. moreover, the pressure pain tolerance thresholds did not decrease after intravenous administration of
naloxone. thus, the release of -end(1–31) or -lph,
determined in venous blood plasma, does not explain
pressure pain analgesia following intravenous crh administration; alternate mechanisms must underlie the
evoked analgesic effect. furthermore, 5 min after intravenous administration of 12 mg naloxone, no effects on
pressure and temperature pain tolerance thresholds were
observed.
after intravenous crh administration, only low plasma levels of -end(1–31) (!50 pmol/l) were measured.
the binding of -end(1–31) interacting with opioid receptors via its n-terminal tyrosine residue follows the law
of mass action:
kd =

copioid < copioid receptor
copioid /opioid receptor complex

(1)

the equilibrium constants (kd) for binding of

-end(1–31) to cloned - or -opioid receptors are in

discrimination between authentic -end(1–31) and
-end irm in human plasma has been difﬁcult to
achieve because of the lack of speciﬁcity of antisera raised
against -end(1–31). previously used ria systems to
determine -end irm (e.g. the -end irma, developed by nichols® institute) cross-react with -lph (16%)
or n-acetyl--end (100%), which were also detected in
human plasma [13, 26, 28]. the signiﬁcant correlation
between the plasma concentrations of -lph, using the
93e ria, and -end irm levels, using the nichols ria,
demonstrated that -lph is a major component of the
-end irm, determined by the nichols ria. in addition, the lack of a signiﬁcant correlation between the plasma concentrations of -end(1–31) and -end irm levels, determined by the nichols ria, showed that end(1–31) might be a minor component of the -end
irm, determined by the nichols ria.

the nanomolar range (kd ;10–9 mol/l) [29]. given a 50pmol -end(1–31) concentration (copioid = 50 pmol/l) in
plasma, from equation 1 follows:
copioid/opioid receptor complex ; 0.05  copioid receptor

(2)

where c is given in nmol/l.
consequently, only a negligible percentage of peripheral opioid receptors (approx. 5%) can be assumed to interact with plasma -end(1–31). thus, the concentration of authentic -end(1–31), determined in venous
blood plasma, should be too low to mediate any analgesic
function. therefore, we doubt that -end(1–31), as determined in venous blood plasma under various stress
conditions as yet, can function as a clinically effective
analgesic. this point of view is compatible with the fact
that -end irm released in volunteers into the blood
after crh administration [20] and occurring in a concentration as high as found under postoperative stress
[30] was shown to lack any analgesic effect. our point of
view is also compatible with the lack of any analgesic effect in response to a -end infusion in patients leading
to plasma levels exceeding those seen during surgery by
a factor of 100 [31]. nevertheless, the concentration of

intravenous crh administration increases the
pressure pain, but not the heat pain tolerance
threshold
in contrast to pressure pain sensitivity, heat pain sensitivity did not change signiﬁcantly after administration
of crh. the statistically signiﬁcant effect of intravenous
administration of 100 g crh on pressure pain tolerance
was only about 5%, but the effect is supported by many
reports from the literature [2–9]. the point is that crh
did not inﬂuence heat pain tolerance under identical conditions.
results of several studies showing that mechanisms of
pain elicited by heat and mechanical stimuli are different
(for references, see treede et al. [34]) are compatible with
our ﬁndings. furthermore, there is ample evidence from
psychophysical studies on humans that heat and pressure
pain sensitivity do not mirror the same nociceptive processes [e.g. 35]. the most important difference is that
mechanically induced pain is considered to be mediated
by central mechanisms [36, 37], whereas peripheral
mechanisms are thought to play an important role in thermal nociception and heat pain sensitivity [38, 39]. crh
might act at a number of sites in the central nervous system (cns) as well as in the periphery to affect pain processing [40].
as to a peripheral site of action, crh receptors are not
present on peripheral nerve endings of subcutaneous sensory neurons [41], excluding a local effect of crh on heat
pain sensitivity. however, receptors for crh have been
found on sensory [10] and on sympathetic ganglia [3];
therefore, circulating crh could modulate afferent input
at this level as a contribution to central pain processing.
concerning a central mechanism of crh action, information is available indicating that crh is able to cross
the blood-brain barrier (bbb) and to elicit central effects.
although several authors assumed that crh should only
act outside the cns after intravenous administration [4,
6, 8], a speciﬁc transport system for crh from the brain
to the cardiovascular compartment has been described by
martins et al. [42], who claimed that the permeation of
at least small amounts of crh in the opposite direction

crh, authentic -end and pain
sensitivity

cannot be excluded. in fact, an inﬂux of crh from the
cardiovascular compartment into the brain has been observed [43]. thus, small amounts of crh in the nanogram range, which have been shown to be effective when
administered directly into the cns [9, 44, 45], might
cross the bbb. therefore, a small amount of intravenously administered crh might act at sites in the spinal cord
and throughout the brain to elicit effects on pressure pain
sensitivity as demonstrated in our study. whatever is the
case, a potential site of action of crh in the spinal cord
may be postulated, but has not been proven by the presented data.
reports from literature in fact suggest the possibility
of modulatory crh effects on pain sensitivity at the spinal cord level. immunohistological studies indicate the
presence of crh in nerve ﬁbers within the spinal dorsal
horn [46], where the majority of pain-conducting, primary-afferent c ﬁbers terminate. in terminals of the primary afferent c ﬁbers, crh is co-localized with  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) and excitatory amino acids, and both sp
and excitatory amino acids are released upon noxious
stimulation in the spinal cord dorsal horn [47]. moreover,
it was shown that crh inhibits physiological responses
to noxious stimuli in wide dynamic range (wdr) neurons [8] and again, sp is a transmitter at those wdr neurons and regarded as a prototypic neuropeptide released
from primary afferent c ﬁbers. crh may therefore have
a direct action at this level modulating the nociceptive
input by inhibiting the release of sp from primary afferent ﬁbers. in fact, an inhibitory effect of crh on the release of tachykinins such as sp from primary sensory
nerves had been observed by nadel and colleagues [48].
further studies, in addition, indicate that crh and neurokinins such as sp cooperate with excitatory amino acids
in modulation of spinal excitability [47, 49]. in line with
all of these ﬁndings, analgesic effects of crh within the
spinal dorsal horn have, in fact, been demonstrated [1,
39].
the results of our study show crh effects on pressure
pain, but not on heat pain sensitivity. reports from the
literature in fact show that noxious mechanical, but not
thermal stimuli evoke substance sp release in the spinal
dorsal horn [38]. recently it was shown that sp and neurokinin-1 ( xxxg234xxx ) receptors are important mediators of
noxious mechanical stimuli [50]. in addition, it was
shown that  xxxg234xxx  receptors contribute to mechanical, but
not thermal, pain sensitivity in nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain [51]. thus, crh effects at the spinal level
may easily explain the reduction of pressure pain sensitivity as observed in our study; moreover, even the result

-end(1–31), determined in venous blood plasma, does
not reﬂect concentrations of -end(1–31) in peripheral
tissues. spikes of high -end(1–31) concentrations
around opioid receptors in peripheral tissues are possible;
thus, it cannot be excluded that -end(1–31), generated
at any site in peripheral tissues, has an analgesic function
at such a site of origin, which has been postulated before
[32, 33].

that thermal pain sensitivity is not inﬂuenced by crh in
our study is compatible with reports from the literature.
in summary, in this study it was shown for the ﬁrst
time that intravenously administered crh induces a reduction of pressure pain sensitivity, but not of heat pain
sensitivity. we demonstrated that the release of endogenous opioids such as authentic -end(1–31), determined
in peripheral blood plasma, does not explain the analgesic
crh effect. recently, it was shown that pressure pain
stimuli evoke sp release in the spinal dorsal horn and that
sp and  xxxg234xxx  receptors are important mediators of pressure pain, but not of heat pain sensitivity. thus, a small
amount of intravenously administered crh is very like-

ly to be able to cross the bbb, modulating via crh receptors the release of sp from primary afferents in the
spinal cord to reduce pressure pain sensitivity.
