disulfiram and  xxxd1917xxx  are competitive inhibitors at the  xxxg2342xxx .  in the present study in vitro interactions of disulfiram (an agent used to induce ethanol intolerance in alcoholics),  xxxd1917xxx  (ddc), and metronidazole with central benzodiazepine receptors (cbr) and peripheral benzodiazepine (bz) receptors (pbr) were investigated in rat tissues. disulfiram displaced specific binding of [3h]pk 11195 from pbr in the cerebral cortex with an ic50 value of 5 x 10(-7) m. the binding of [3h]pk 11195 and [3h]ro 5-4864 to pbr in the kidney was displaced by disulfiram with ic50 values of 7 x 10(-7) and 2 x 10(-7) m, respectively. ddc displaced [3h]pk 11195 binding to kidney membranes with an ic50 value of 5 x 10(-5) m. binding of [3h] flunitrazepam to cbr in the cerebral cortex was not affected by either disulfiram or ddc. metronidazole (up to 10(-4) m), a disulfiram congener, did not affect [3h]flunitrazepam ( xxxg803xxx ) and [3h] pk 11195 binding to cbr and pbr, respectively. scatchard analysis of [3h]pk 11195 binding to kidney membranes, performed in the absence or presence of 7 x 10(-7) m disulfiram, decreased ligand affinity without influencing the maximal number of binding sites, suggesting a competitive inhibition.  xxxd26xxx  (2 x 10(-2) m), which blocks the inhibitory activity of disulfiram and ddc at the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, did not affect the inhibitory potency of disulfiram at the kidney pbr. removal of disulfiram from kidney by repeated washing with tris-hcl buffer resulted in the restoration of binding properties to control values, suggesting reversibility of disulfiram binding to pbr.
