abstract
the human platelet antigen-1 (hpa-1, pla) polymorphism has been proposed to influence the inhibitory actions of  xxxd53xxx . thus,
we hypothesized that this polymorphism might also be the cause for paradoxical activation of platelets by  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors. the
effects of  xxxd53xxx  (1 – 10 ag/ml),  xxxd3385xxx  (3 – 30 nm), or  xxxd2017xxx  (0.3 – 3 ag/ml) on basal and adp (3 am)-induced  xxxg2049xxx 
externalization were measured in n = 62 healthy blood donors and n = 177 patients with stable coronary artery disease. all subjects were
genotyped for the human platelet antigen-1 (hpa-1, pla) polymorphism by galiosr and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.
although a significant platelet hyperreactivity was observed in the patients, the hpa-1 genotype did not influence basal or adp-induced
 xxxg2049xxx  expression. a moderate (twofold) stimulation of  xxxg2049xxx  expression by  xxxd53xxx  but not by  xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd2017xxx  was observed
in one patient. interestingly, this patient carried the hpa-1 b/b genotype. in no other subject any activation of platelets by gp iib/iiia
inhibitors was observed and there were no statistically significant differences between hpa-1 genotypes with respect to the effects of gp
iib/iiia inhibitors on basal or adp-stimulated  xxxg2049xxx  expression. it is concluded that paradoxical platelet activation by  xxxd53xxx  is a rare
( < 2%) phenomenon. hpa-1 b/b genotype might be a contributing factor but clearly does not predict platelet activation by gp iib/iiia
inhibitors.

it has been reported that glycoprotein (gp) iib/iiia
inhibitors may have an intrinsic property to induce fibrinogen binding and subsequent platelet aggregation [1].
accordingly, an increased expression of  xxxg2049xxx  has been
reported in some patients treated with orbofiban [2]. this
paradoxical stimulation of fibrinogen binding by gp iib/iiia
inhibitors has been recently disputed [3,4] and does not

appear to be a general phenomenon. however, a very
pronounced stimulation of platelet  xxxg2049xxx  expression within
minutes after the start of treatment with  xxxd53xxx  has been
observed in one out of 25 patients with coronary artery
disease [5]. this clearly reflects platelet activation and not
only a change of the conformational state of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia
receptors. interestingly, following exposition of platelets
isolated from this patient to  xxxd53xxx  in vitro, a marked
platelet activation was reinduced.
the human platelet antigen-1 (hpa-1, pla) polymorphism has recently been proposed to influence the inhibitory
actions of  xxxd53xxx  [6,7]. thus, we hypothesized that this
polymorphism might also be involved in the paradoxical

activation of platelets by  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors as described
by peter et al. [5].

1. materials and methods
1.1. study subjects
this study was conducted according to the helsinki
declaration and was approved by the ethics committee of
the heinrich-heine-universität of düsseldorf. one study
group (n = 62) consisted of healthy blood donors (45 men
and 17 women, age 38.1 f 1.4 years). the second study
group (n = 177) consisted of patients with stable coronary
artery disease according to established diagnostic criteria
(132 men and 45 women, age 63.9 f 0.9 years). subjects
taking thienoypridines were excluded from the study.
aspirin treatment did not affect  xxxd80xxx 
(adp)-induced platelet activation, which was measured at
2 mm ca2 + concentration [8].
1.2. human platelet antigen-1 (hpa-1) genotyping

platelet  xxxg2049xxx  expression (mean fluorescence intensity,  xxxd1045xxx ) in healthy
blood donors (controls) and in patients with stable coronary artery disease
(cad) according to the human platelet antigen-1 (hpa-1) genotype. data
are means f sem. the figures indicate the number of subjects genotyped
for the respective allele. there were no statistically significant differences
between the genotypes ( p > 0.05, anova).

hpa-1 genotypes were determined by galiosr and
single molecule detection as previously described in detail
[9]. galiosr (gene amplification and labeling in one
system) employs one pair of gene-specific amplification
primers and two allele-specific, fluorescent (tamra for
hpa-1a; evobluer 50 for hpa-1b) labeling primers in a
single reaction. allele-specific fluorescent pcr products
were detected by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
(fcs) using an automated instrument for single-nucleotide
polymorphism analysis (evotec technologies, evotec
analytical systems, erkrath, germany).

disease (cad). data are means f sem, n.s., not significant (anova,

1.3. platelet function
platelets were isolated from citrated (1:9; v/v) blood and
the expression of  xxxg2049xxx  was measured by flow cytometry
as previously described [10]. when indicated,  xxxd53xxx 
(centocor, leiden, the netherlands, 1– 10 ag/ml),  xxxd3385xxx 
(msd sharp & dohme, haar, germany, 3– 30 nm), or
 xxxd2017xxx  (essex pharma, münchen, germany, 0.3– 3 ag/
ml) were incubated with the samples for 15 min at 37 jc.
 xxxg2049xxx  expression was measured in unstimulated and in
 xxxd80xxx  (adp, 3 am, 15 min, 37 jc)stimulated platelets, respectively.
1.4. statistics
the data are means f sem of n experiments. statistical
analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance

(anova) followed by the bonferroni multiple comparisons
test. p levels of < 0.05 were considered significant. for
estimation of the incidence (p, binominal distribution) of
platelet activation by gp iib/iiia inhibitors, the 95% confidence interval was calculated.

2. results
2.1. platelet hyperreactivity in patients with coronary artery
disease
the basal expression of  xxxg2049xxx  was not different between
healthy control subjects and patients with stable coronary
artery disease. however, a marked platelet hyperreactivity
was observed in patients with coronary artery disease. in
these patients, adp (3 am)-stimulated  xxxg2049xxx  expression

(cad) according to the human platelet antigen-1 (hpa-1) genotype. data are means f sem. there were no statistically significant differences between the
genotypes with respect to the effects of gp iib/iiia inhibitors (p>0.05, anova).

was significantly ( p < 0.001) higher as compared to healthy
controls (fig. 1).
2.2. adp-induced platelet  xxxg2049xxx  expression is not dependent on the hpa-1 genotype
the human platelet antigen-1 (hpa-1) genotype has been
determined in all patients. the frequencies of each genotype
are displayed in fig. 2. the biased hpa-1 distribution in
control subjects is due to the fact that some pre-genotyped
subjects were included. in patients with coronary artery
disease, there was no genotype pre-selection. as shown in
fig. 2, the hpa-1 genotype did not influence basal or adpinduced  xxxg2049xxx  expression in control subjects or in patients
with stable coronary artery disease.
2.3. effects of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors on platelet  xxxg2049xxx 
expression
the effects of the three  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors approved for
clinical use ( xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd3385xxx ,  xxxd2017xxx ) on basal and
adp (3 am)-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression were studied in
healthy blood donors (controls, n = 62) and in patients with
stable coronary artery disease cad (n = 177). only in one
patient with stable coronary artery disease, a moderate
stimulation of  xxxg2049xxx  expression was observed upon incubation with  xxxd53xxx  (fig. 3a). in this patient, basal
expression of  xxxg2049xxx  was already markedly increased.
addition of  xxxd53xxx  (10 ag/ml) resulted in an about
twofold increase in  xxxg2049xxx  fluorescence intensity. neither
the lower  xxxd53xxx  concentration (1 ag/ml) nor the other
two gp iib/iiia inhibitors did increase  xxxg2049xxx  expression
levels. adp-induced  xxxg2049xxx  expression was not further
potentiated by any of the gp iib/iiia inhibitors studied.
based on the total number of 239 subjects included in our
study, the incidence of platelet activation by  xxxd53xxx  was
0.4 % (95% confidence interval 0.02%; 2%). thus, paradoxical platelet activation by gp iib/iiia inhibitors appears
to be a rare ( < 2%) phenomenon.
interestingly, the patient who showed platelet activation by  xxxd53xxx  carried the hpa-1 b/b genotype. however, in no other subject any activation of platelets by gp
iib/iiia inhibitors was observed (fig. 3b) and there were
no statistically significant differences between hpa-1
genotypes with respect to the effects of gp iib/iiia inhibitors on basal or adp-stimulated  xxxg2049xxx  expression
(fig. 4).

3. discussion
in accordance with previous findings published by others
[11 – 13], this study demonstrates a significant platelet
hyperreactivity in patients with coronary artery disease.
however, no influence of the hpa-1 genotype on platelet
activation was observed.

there is some controversy on the effects of the hpa-1
polymorphism on platelet function. some authors have
found increased platelet fibrinogen binding or aggregation
in the hpa-1 b/b genotype [6,14 – 16], while others could
not confirm these findings [17].
interestingly, a moderate stimulation of  xxxg2049xxx  expression by  xxxd53xxx  but not by  xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd2017xxx  was
observed in one patient with coronary artery disease. based
on the total number of 239 subjects included in our study,
the incidence of platelet activation by  xxxd53xxx  was
estimated to be < 2% (upper limit of the 95% confidence
interval). thus, paradoxical platelet activation by gp iib/iiia
inhibitors appears to be a rare phenomenon. remarkably,
the patient who showed an increased  xxxg2049xxx  expression by
 xxxd53xxx  carried the hpa-1 b/b genotype. however, in no
other subject any activation of platelets by gp iib/iiia
inhibitors was observed and there were no statistically
significant differences between hpa-1 genotypes with
respect to the effects of these compounds on basal or
adp-stimulated  xxxg2049xxx  expression.
in the patient described by peter et al. [5], exposure of
platelets to  xxxd53xxx  in vivo and in vitro resulted in a very
marked platelet activation.  xxxd53xxx  [18] and  xxxd2017xxx —but not orbofiban—[13] potentiated agonist-induced
 xxxg2049xxx  expression by about 10 –20% without having direct
stimulatory effects. however, a recent study from the same
group has demonstrated a significant inhibition of adpinduced  xxxg2049xxx  expression by both,  xxxd53xxx  and  xxxd3385xxx 
[19].
in our study, only basal but not adp-stimulated  xxxg2049xxx 
expression was affected by a  xxxd53xxx  in one single
individual carrying the hpa-1 b/b genotype. neither  xxxd3385xxx  nor  xxxd2017xxx  stimulated platelet  xxxg2049xxx  externalization in this patient. interestingly, only the high, suprapharmacological concentration of  xxxd53xxx  (10 ag/ml) resulted
in a platelet activation, while the lower concentration (1 ag/
ml) was ineffective. it is important to note that, in our study,
the majority of the patients with coronary artery disease were
treated with oral aspirin. aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation induced by  xxxd53xxx  [1]. however, the marked platelet
activation (measured as  xxxg2049xxx  expression) observed in one
patient upon infusion of  xxxd53xxx  [5] occurred after intravenous application of 500 mg aspirin.
taken together, paradoxical platelet activation by  xxxd53xxx  is a rare ( < 2%) phenomenon. hpa-1 b/b genotype
might be a contributing factor but this genotype clearly does
not predict paradoxical platelet activation by  xxxd53xxx .
because this phenomenon was only observed at suprapharmacological concentrations, it is very unlikely to be of
clinical relevance.
