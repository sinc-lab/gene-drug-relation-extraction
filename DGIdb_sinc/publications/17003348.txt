sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, commonly used for antidiabetes therapies, are known to stimulate insulin release
from pancreatic ␤-cells by closing atp-sensitive kⴙ channels. however, the specific actions of these drugs on insulin
granule motion are largely unknown. here, we used total
internal reflection fluorescence (tirf) microscopy to analyze the docking and fusion of single insulin granules in
live ␤-cells exposed to either the sulfonylurea drug  xxxd2215xxx  or the glinide drug  xxxd2654xxx . tirf images
showed that both agents caused rapid fusion of newcomer
insulin granules with the cell membrane in both control and
diabetic goto-kakizaki (gk) rat pancreatic ␤-cells. however, in the context of ␤-cells from  xxxg19xxx 
( xxxg19xxx ) knockout mice, tirf images showed that only
 xxxd2654xxx , but not  xxxd2215xxx , caused fusion of newcomer insulin granules. compositely, our data indicate that
1) the mechanism by which both sulfonylurea and glinide
drugs promote insulin release entails the preferential fusion of newcomer, rather than previously docked, insulin
granules, and that 2)  xxxd2654xxx  can induce insulin release
by a mechanism independent of  xxxd2654xxx  binding to
 xxxg19xxx . diabetes 55:2819 –2825, 2006

treatments to increase insulin release from diabetic
␤-cells include pharmaceutical agents targeting atp-sensitive k⫹ channels (katp channels) (5,6) because these

(7–9). drugs directed to inhibit  xxxg1253xxx  function
include sulfonylureas and glinides. sulfonylurea drugs
such as  xxxd2215xxx  have long been used clinically to
increase insulin release in type 2 diabetes (10,11). more
recently, nonsulfonylurea drugs, including glinides such as
 xxxd2702xxx  ( xxxd2702xxx ) and  xxxd2654xxx  (kad-1229), have
become available for clinical use (12–14). it is generally
accepted that both sulfonylureas and glinides induce katp
channel closure, resulting in downstream increased intracellular ca2⫹ concentration ([ca2⫹]i) and subsequent insulin release. however, several details in the mechanism
by which sulfonylureas and glinides control not only katp
channel function but also the insulin exocytotic process
are still unknown.
 xxxg1253xxx  function is mediated by the pore-forming
subunit  xxxg1250xxx  and the sulfonylurea receptor subunit 1
( xxxg19xxx ) (15). the sur subunit, a member of the abc
transporter family, is considered responsible for the
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  complex sensitivity to sulfonylurea and glinide drugs (16 –18). it has been concretely shown that
sulfonylureas bind the sur subunit and that the sur
moiety on sulfonylureas, which functions as a ligand for
sur receptors, is required for causing insulin release
(11,19). glinides such as  xxxd2654xxx  lack the sur moiety
present on sulfonylureas, which facilitate these ligands
binding to their cognate receptors (20,21). nevertheless,
 xxxd2654xxx  was shown to inhibit [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding
to  xxxg19xxx  and caused increased [ca2⫹]i (22). therefore,
these drugs exhibit similar downstream effects but are
structurally distinct and may use divergent mechanisms
when compared with each other or with glucose.
to clarify mechanistic differences between these drug
types, as well as between the drugs and glucose-mediated
insulin release, the investigation was focused on the action
of these agents on insulin granule motion, using total
internal reflection fluorescence (tirf) microscopy. we
recently reported use of this system for studying insulin
exocytosis in response to glucose (23–25). using green
fluorescent protein (gfp)-tagged insulin granules (23,26)
and the tirf microscopy technique originally developed
by axelrod (27), we could observe the biphasic kinetics of
insulin release in real time, including a first phase, where
a small population of insulin granules already docked at
the plasma membrane was released, and a second phase,
where newly recruited, or “newcomer,” granules were
2819

antidiabetes agent–induced granule motion

targeted to, and released from, the plasma membrane (24).
thus, this system is a powerful tool to reveal how these
agents act on the insulin exocytotic process. in the present
study, therefore, we used tirf microscopy to analyze
insulin exocytosis in response to sulfonylurea and glinide
drugs in control, diabetic, and  xxxg19xxx  knockout ␤-cells.
specifically, we investigated how the sulfonylurea drug
 xxxd2215xxx  and the glinide drug  xxxd2654xxx  influenced
the docking and fusion of insulin granules at the cell
membrane. our results indicate that these agents initiate
rapid fusion of newcomer insulin granules with the cell
membrane, rather than mimicking the glucose-mediated
first phase of chiefly releasing previously docked granules.
finally, surprisingly, we found that  xxxd2654xxx  in particular can cause insulin fusion in the absence of  xxxg19xxx .
research design and methods
diabetic goto-kakizaki (gk) rats, nondiabetic male wistar rats, and c57bl/6j
male mice were obtained from a commercial breeder (oriental yeast, tokyo,
japan).  xxxg19xxx  knockout mice were kindly provided by joseph bryan (baylor
college of medicine, houston, tx), and its generation and characterization
were described previously (28,29). the animals were given free access to food
and water until the start of experiments requiring intake control, using 10- to
11-week-old male rats or 10- to 11-week-old male mice. blood glucose levels
were determined by a glucose oxidase method (toecho super, kyoto daiichi
kagaku, kyoto, japan). pancreatic islets of langerhans were isolated by
collagenase digestion with minor modifications (3). isolated islets were
dissociated into single cells by incubation in ca2⫹-free krebs-ringer buffer
(krb) containing 1 mmol/l egta, and then they were cultured on a fibronectin-coated high-refractive glass coverslip (olympus) as described previously
(24). to label the insulin secretory granules, pancreatic ␤-cells were infected
with the recombinant adenovirus adex1ca insulin-gfp as described previously (24). on the day of the experiments, infected ␤-cells were treated with
glucose and/or  xxxd2215xxx  (sigma) or  xxxd2654xxx  (synthesized at the
pharmacological laboratory of kissei pharmaceutical, nagano, japan), as
indicated in each figure legend, and tirf experiments were performed as
described elsewhere (23). the secretagogues were first dissolved as concentrated stock solutions in dmso (fluka, buchs, switzerland); the final concentration of dmso was ⬍0.5% (vol/vol).
tirf microscopy. the olympus tirf system was used with an inverted
microscope (ix70; olympus) and a high-aperture objective lens (apo 100⫻
ohr, na 1.65; olympus), as previously described (23). to observe gfp, we
used a 488-nm laser line for excitation and a 515-nm long-pass filter for the
barrier. the images were projected onto a cooled charge-coupled device
(ccd) camera (dv887dcsbv; andor technology, belfast, northern ireland)
operated with metamorph version 6.2 (universal imaging, downingtown, pa).
images were acquired at 300-ms intervals. the space constant for the
exponential decay of the evanescent field was ⬃43 nm, as previously
described (24). for the study, by tirf microscopy of real-time images of
gfp-tagged insulin granule motion, infected ␤-cells were placed on the
high–refractive index glass, mounted in an open chamber, and incubated for
30 min at 37°c in krb containing 110 mmol/l nacl, 4.4 mmol/l kcl, 1.45
mmol/l kh2po4, 1.2 mmol/l  xxxd2534xxx , 2.3 mmol/l  xxxd409xxx , 4.8 mmol/l
nahco3, 2.2 mmol/l glucose, 10 mmol/l hepes (ph 7.4), and 0.3% bsa. cells
were then transferred to the thermostat-controlled stage (37°c) of a tirf
microscope. stimulation was achieved by addition of the indicated concentrations of secretagogues into the chamber.
image acquisition and analysis. most analyses of images collected by a
ccd camera, including tracking (the single projection of different images),
were performed using metamorph software. to analyze the data, we manually
selected fusion events and then calculated the average fluorescence intensity
of individual granules in a 1-␮m ⫻ 1-␮m square placed over the granule center.
the number of fusion events was manually counted while looping 15,000
frame time lapses. sequences were exported as single tiff files and further
processed using adobe photoshop 6.0, or they were converted into quicktime
movies. in all experiments numbering fusion events, we defined “exocytosis”
and “fusion” as follows. exocytosis involves the sequential stages within the
exocytotic pathway: physical movement of vesicles to the subplasmalemmal
region of the cell, tethering and then docking at release sites on the plasma
membrane, conversion to a fully releasable state, triggered membrane fusion,
and release of granule contents. fusion refers only to the final step of
exocytosis: fusion of vesicle membrane with plasma membrane, allowing
release of granule contents.

measurement of [ca2ⴙ]i. pancreatic ␤-cells were loaded with 2 ␮mol/l fura-2
acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 am; molecular probes) for 30 min at 37°c in krb
(2.2 mmol/l glucose), followed by washing and an additional 15-min incubation with krb. then, the coverslips were mounted on an argus/hisca
system (hamamatsu photonics, hamatsu, japan) and then stimulated with
indicated secretogogues. fura-2 fluorescence was detected by a cooled ccd
camera after excitation at wavelengths of 340 nm (f340) and 380 nm (f380),
and the ratio image (f340/f380) was calculated by use of the argus/hisca
system.

results

tirf analysis of docking and fusion of insulin granules in  xxxd2654xxx - and  xxxd2215xxx -treated rat
pancreatic ␤-cells. primary rat pancreatic ␤-cells were
used to study sulfonylurea or glinide action on insulin
granule motion. rat pancreatic ␤-cells harboring gfplabeled insulin granules were exposed to 5.5 mmol/l glucose or 22 mmol/l high glucose alone, or they were
exposed to 5.5 mmol/l glucose plus sulfonylurea and
glinide drugs. we used 500 nmol/l  xxxd2215xxx  as a
representative sulfonylurea drug, and we used 5 ␮mol/l
 xxxd2654xxx  as a representative glinide drug. cells were
monitored by tirf microscopy for real-time images of
docking and fusion of single insulin granules with sequential images acquired every 300 ms (fig. 1). we found that
in agreement with our previous report (24), 22 mmol/l high
glucose stimulated the highest fusion of previously docked
granules, the so-called “residents” that were visible before
stimulation (fig. 1a, resident) during the first phase of
0 – 4 min poststimulation. fusion was observed as a suddenly brightening and vanishing fluorescent spot. in contrast, in the ⬎4-min second phase, the fusion events rather
arose from newcomer granules (fig. 1a and supplemental
movie 1, which is detailed in the online appendix [available at http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org]). stimulation
by 5.5 mmol/l glucose only resulted in an overall small
number of fusion events, mostly from newcomers (fig. 1b
and supplemental movie 2). on the other hand, 5 ␮mol/l
 xxxd2654xxx  under 5.5 mmol/l glucose significantly stimulated rapid fusion events, involving mostly newcomer
granules, in addition to some previously docked granule
fusion events (fusion events from previously docked granules 9.00 ⫾ 1.61 per 200 ␮m2 in 0 – 4 min, n ⫽ 5 cells) (figs.
1c and 2c and supplemental movie 3). treatment with 500
nmol/l  xxxd2215xxx  under 5.5 mmol/l glucose also stimulated rapid fusion events from newcomers (fig. 1d and
supplemental movie 4). as shown in fig. 2, fusion events
stimulated by  xxxd2654xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  were markedly increased compared with 5.5 mmol/l glucose stimulation (total fusion events: 44.2 ⫾ 7.60 vs. 9.02 ⫾ 0.90 per 200

histogram of fusion events, when the number of fusion
events is small, the error bar is large. this is due to
counting the number of fusion events as zero when no
fusion occurred. the kinetics of these two drugs varied in
that the largest number of fusion events was observed
61–120 s after the addition of  xxxd2654xxx , versus 121–180 s
after the addition of  xxxd2215xxx . thus, the time for
responding to  xxxd2654xxx  was rapid compared with that of
 xxxd2215xxx . we also noted that the number of fusion
events initiated by  xxxd2654xxx  in 0 – 4 min was larger than

fusion event was observed at 500-nmol/l concentrations,
treatment with 5 ␮mol/l  xxxd2215xxx  still did not cause
fusion of previously docked granules with the cell membrane. as shown in fig. 4, both 5 ␮mol/l  xxxd2654xxx  and 5

exocytosis.
discussion

sulfonylurea and glinide drugs are commonly used to treat
type 2 diabetes; however, the mechanism of these drugs’
action on the translocation, docking, and fusion of insulin
secretory granules is largely unknown. here, we used
tirf microscopy to investigate the action of these drugs
on insulin granule motion and to provide the first report
that these drugs activate the translocation of insulin
granules from an inner pool to subsequent fusion with the
plasma membrane. these results add details, and raise
additional questions, regarding the mechanism by which
these drugs stimulate insulin release from pancreatic
␤-cells.
diabetes, vol. 55, october 2006

we found that both  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2654xxx 
caused rapid fusion in a time course nearly identical to the
first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release, mostly
from newcomer insulin granules, rather than docked insulin granules, in both control and diabetic pancreatic
␤-cells. it is intriguing that both agents had little affect on
the status of previously docked insulin granules, even
though sulfonylureas were originally thought to mimic the
first phase of glucose-induced insulin release, in which
previously docked granules are the major type released
(24,25). the reason for this mechanistic difference is
currently unknown, but we anticipate that the intracellular
site of  xxxg19xxx  and katp channels might be involved in the
action of these agents. indeed, several reports have indicated that there are intracellular actions of sulfonylureas
(30 –32). recently, geng et al. (33) demonstrated that
 xxxg19xxx  and katp channels are present on the insulin secretory granules. renstrom et al. (34) proposed the model
that sulfonylurea binding to the secretory granule membrane facilitates lowering of granule ph, resulting in
increased exocytosis. if that is the case, intracellular
interaction of sulfonylureas and glinides with insulin granules may accelerate granule translocation, priming, and
exocytosis and may account for the drug-induced fusion of
newcomer granules. on the other hand, it should be noted
that only  xxxd2654xxx , but not  xxxd2215xxx , caused fusion
in  xxxg19xxx  knockout ␤-cells, indicating that action of  xxxd2215xxx  is mainly mediated through  xxxg19xxx , but action of
 xxxd2654xxx  is not. thus, there must be not only the
mechanistic difference between  xxxd2654xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx , but also unknown mechanisms to be anticipated
for this phenomenon. in addition, the question of why the
[ca2⫹]i increase by both agents does not cause fusion from
previously docked granules remains to be determined. we
speculate that there must be differences in the exocytotic
process and/or in sites relevant to increased [ca2⫹]i between fusion from previously docked granules and fusion
from newcomers, but further studies are required to
dissect these differences.
our results show that fusion of insulin granules induced
by  xxxd2654xxx  was more rapid than that induced by  xxxd2215xxx . this result is incongruent with a generally
accepted mechanism in which  xxxd2654xxx  acts solely
through interaction with  xxxg19xxx . because  xxxd2654xxx ’s affinity for  xxxg19xxx  has been shown to be weaker than  xxxd2215xxx ’s affinity for sur, the more rapid fusion induced
by  xxxd2654xxx  is inexplicable in terms of binding affinity
toward  xxxg19xxx  (22). furthermore, because the increase in
[ca2⫹]i induced by  xxxd2654xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  was
almost similar, we cannot explain the faster fusion caused
by  xxxd2654xxx  in terms of [ca2⫹]i change. one consideration is that these drugs might target disparate molecules
and protein interactions. previous studies showed that
 xxxd2215xxx  quickly crosses the lipid bilayer (35); we do
not know the comparative movement of  xxxd2654xxx  across
the membrane or what cellular molecules besides  xxxg19xxx 
may interact with  xxxd2654xxx . given the lipophilic nature
of  xxxd2654xxx , it seems likely that  xxxd2654xxx  may rapidly
enter the cytosol and interact with  xxxd2654xxx -targeted
molecules associated with intracellular insulin granule
trafficking, thereby facilitating efficient insulin granule
translocation and subsequent fusion.
the likelihood that  xxxd2654xxx  interacts with an insulin
secretion/regulatory cellular protein other than  xxxg19xxx  is
supported by our finding that only  xxxd2654xxx , but not
 xxxd2215xxx , induced fusion events in  xxxg19xxx  knockout

proposed model. it is generally supposed
that sulfonylureas and glinides bind  xxxg19xxx ,
resulting in  xxxg1253xxx  closure, and subsequently opening ca2ⴙ channels. increased
[ca2ⴙ]i triggers the fusion of previously
docked granules, resembling the first phase
of glucose-induced insulin release. b: our
model based on tirf data. our tirf imaging
analysis revealed that these drugs directly
activate the insulin granules to accelerate
the translocation from intracellular pool to
the plasma membrane for subsequent fusion.
 xxxd2654xxx  appears to have a  xxxg19xxx -independent pathway for modulating insulin granule
motion.

␤-cells. at the least, this suggests that  xxxd2654xxx  affects a
molecule(s) not affected by  xxxd2215xxx . although  xxxd2215xxx  action is mostly mediated via  xxxg19xxx ,  xxxd2654xxx 
appears to have alternative interacting proteins or pathways besides  xxxg19xxx  available for regulating insulin granule
motion. based on the differences these drugs display in
efficiency of insulin release in rat ␤-cells and in ability to
release insulin from  xxxg19xxx  knockout mouse ␤-cells, we
speculate that  xxxd2654xxx  might bind an unidentified intracellular molecule closely associated with vesicle trafficking. we propose the following as possible mechanisms by
which  xxxd2654xxx  increases fusion events from newcomer
insulin granules: 1)  xxxd2654xxx  might affect cytoskeletal
elements such as actin or myosin because myosin va was
recently reported to be involved in insulin granule movement during the second phase of insulin release (36); 2)
 xxxd2654xxx  might directly affect the granular ph, which was
recently reported to regulate insulin exocytosis (34,37,38);
or 3)  xxxd2654xxx  might increase insulin biosynthesis.
from a clinical perspective, our finding that sulfonylurea and glinide drugs induced the fusion of newcomer
granules confirms the beneficial role of these drugs in
treating type 2 diabetes. we previously reported that
diabetic gk rat ␤-cells showed a marked reduction in the
number of docked insulin granules, which may be one of
the factors causing the reduced fusion events during the
first phase of insulin release (4,24). this implies that drugs
driving the fusion of previously docked granules with the
plasma membrane may be less effective in type 2 diabetes
therapy than drugs that drive the fusion of newcomers, as
seen here for  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2654xxx . our finding
showing that  xxxd2654xxx  caused increased fusion in diabetic gk ␤-cells relative to that observed in normal ␤-cells
(fusion events: 41.9 ⫾ 7.00 vs. 29.8 ⫾ 4.95 per 200 ␮m2,
respectively, in 0 – 4 min, p ⬍ 0.0001, n ⫽ 5 cells) also
supports the specific application of this drug as a diabetic
therapy. we consider it possible that an unidentified target
molecule for  xxxd2654xxx  may be upregulated in diabetic
␤-cells, therefore promoting drug efficacy or efficiency. we
propose a possible mechanism by which sulfonylurea and
glinide drugs activate insulin granule motion and subsequent fusion, as shown in fig. 7.
in conclusion, our tirf imaging analysis revealed that
the mechanism of action for both the sulfonylurea and
glinide drugs tested here preferentially induced fusion of
newcomer insulin granules; previously docked granules in
both normal and diabetic ␤-cells received little or no
influence from these drugs. because the mechanism of
 xxxd2654xxx  action singularly appeared to achieve this
effect even in the absence of  xxxg19xxx , a new door is opened
for investigating  xxxg19xxx -independent pathways.
