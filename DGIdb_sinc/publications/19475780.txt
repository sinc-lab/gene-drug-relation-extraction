aims: to review the major trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the use of sibutramine
for weight loss and the impact of this agent on obesity-related disorders.
methods and results: the most important articles on sibutramine up to january 2009 were
located by a pubmed and medline search. sibutramine reduces food intake and body weight
more than placebo and has positive effects on the lipid profile (mainly triglycerides and high
density lipoprotein cholesterol), glycemic control and inflammatory markers in studies for
up to one year. preliminary studies showed that sibutramine may also improve other obesityassociated disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome, left ventricular hypertrophy, binge
eating disorder and adolescent obesity. the high discontinuation rates and some safety issues
mainly due to the increase in blood pressure and pulse rate have to be considered. additionally,
it has not yet been established that treatment with sibutramine will reduce cardiovascular events
and total mortality.
conclusions: sibutramine, in conjunction with lifestyle measures, is a useful drug for reducing
body weight and improving associated cardiometabolic risk factors and obesity-related disorders.
studies of longer duration are required to determine the precise indications of the drug, to evaluate
safety issues and to assess its efficacy on cardiovascular mortality.
keywords: sibutramine, obesity, weight loss, cardiometabolic risk factors, obesity-related
disorders, side-effects

the prevalence of obesity is increasing substantially in both developed and developing
countries during the last decades.1 almost two thirds of the adult us population is
overweight and almost one third is obese.2 similar high rates and trends were reported
in certain european countries.3 obesity, particularly when associated with abdominal
fat distribution, increases the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.4,5
overweight and obesity also increase the risk for cancer-related mortality and for all
cause mortality6 and result in reduced life expectancy.7,8
lifestyle measures are the cornerstone of prevention and treatment of obesity.9
however, adding antiobesity agents can be considered in obese patients who did
not achieve sufficient weight loss after lifestyle modifications and if patients accept
risks and benefits of these agents.9,10 two agents are currently approved for longterm management of obesity, sibutramine and orlistat. the newer antiobesity drug
rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist, was recently suspended from the
market due to increased incidents of suicidal behavior and depression among treated
patients.11

data regarding the efficacy and safety of sibutramine
were reported in recent reviews.12,13 in the present paper
we describe the mechanism of action of sibutramine and
present the most important trials that evaluated the body
weight-reduction potential of this agent. furthermore, we
comment on recent studies evaluating the effects of sibutramine on cardiometabolic risk factors and in specific pathological conditions related with obesity such as polycystic
ovary syndrome, sleep apnea syndrome, left ventricular
hypertrophy, binge eating disorder and in adolescent obesity.
finally, we evaluated studies comparing sibutramine with
orlistat and address the safety issues associated with the
use of this agent. the most important relevant articles on
sibutramine until january 2009 were reviewed through a
pubmed and medline search.

mechanism of action
sibutramine induces weight loss by selectively inhibiting the
neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine within
the hypothalamus.10 to a smaller degree it also inhibits
the reuptake of dopamine.10 studies in subjects who were
not attempting to lose weight showed that sibutramine acts
by reducing food intake.14,15 this appears to result from an
increase in satiety and a reduction in appetite.15–19 it was also
shown that sibutramine might augment energy expenditure
in both the basal and fed states.16 in addition, sibutramine
prevented the decrease in energy expenditure and basal
metabolic rate that follows weight loss.18,20,21 however,
other studies did not find any change in metabolic rate with
sibutramine.22 the action on thermogenesis seems of minor
importance in weight reduction.
besides increased sympathetic activity, sibutramine
treatment in animals and in humans may alter central  xxxg1590xxx  (npy), and  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) mrna
levels and, additionally, the potent anorexigenic hormones
leptin and insulin.23,24 concerning the effects on leptin, it was
reported that sibutramine might maintain or even increase
leptin transport into the brain during weight loss, while this
did not occur during orlistat treatment.25

studies assessing the weight-lowering
potential of sibutramine
in an early dose-ranging study in 235 overweight or obese
patients, 10 mg sibutramine per day were as effective as
15 mg/day; both doses were more effective than the 5 mg/day
dose.26 in another study in 485 obese men, sibutramine (10 or
15 mg/day for one year) and behavior treatment reduced
body weight, body mass index (bmi), waist circumference,

and waist/hip ratio (whr) more than behavior therapy and
placebo.27 greater proportions of patients in both sibutramine groups lost at least 5% or 10% of their baseline body
weight compared with the placebo group.27 both doses were
more effective than placebo and the 15 mg/day dose was
more effective than the 10 mg/day dose.27 in a larger doseranging study in 1047 obese patients, sibutramine (1, 5, 10,
15, 20, or 30 mg/day for 24 weeks) induced dose-dependent
weight loss, which was significantly higher than placebo.28
in a meta-analysis, weight loss with sibutramine was larger
with the 15 mg/day dose.29 the dosage range of sibutramine
is 5 to 15 mg/day; 10 mg/day as a single daily dose is the
recommended starting dose.30
in another study in 322 overweight or obese patients,
sibutramine (20 mg/day for 24 weeks) reduced body weight,
bmi and waist circumference and improved the quality of life
more than placebo.31 in a recent study in 362 obese patients,
sibutramine (15 mg/day for 54 weeks) reduced body weight by
a mean of 3.0 kg more than placebo.32 the efficacy of sibutramine appears to be similar in every day clinical practice.
in a nonblinded study in 588 obese patients, sibutramine
(10–15 mg/day for one year) within a weight management
program induced greater reductions in body weight, bmi,
waist circumference and body fat than the weight management program alone.33 more patients in the sibutramine group
experienced 5% weight loss (47.3% vs 19.1% in the weight
management program only group; p  0.001).33
in a recent meta-analysis of randomized placebocontrolled trials of sibutramine of at least one year in duration (10 studies with 2,623 patients), sibutramine reduced
body weight by 4.2 kg (3.6 to 4.7 kg) more than placebo.34
a higher proportion of patients treated with sibutramine
achieved 5% weight loss (55% vs 27% in the placebo
group) or 10% weight loss (28% vs 10% in the placebo
group).34 there was also a greater reduction in bmi in the
sibutramine group. sibutramine appears to reduce visceral
more than subcutaneous adiposity. in the meta-analysis by
rucker and colleagues34 there was a 4 cm decrease in waist
circumference with sibutramine. in a subgroup of patients in
the sibutramine trial of obesity reduction and maintenance
(storm) study, computed tomography showed a preferential reduction in visceral fat.35 similar results were reported in
a smaller study using magnetic resonance imaging to assess
changes in adipose tissue.36
sibutramine also prevents weight regain when administered
after a dietary intervention. in the storm study 605 obese
patients were given sibutramine (10 mg/day) and followed
a low-energy diet for six months.37 patients achieving 5%

weight loss after six months (n = 467) were randomly
allocated to continue sibutramine (10 mg/day uptitrated to
20 mg/day if weight regain occurred; n = 350) or placebo
(n = 114) for 18 months.37 the sibutramine group had less
weight regain than the placebo group.37 more patients in
the sibutramine group maintained 80% of the weight loss
achieved during the first 6 months of the study (43% vs 16%
in the placebo group; p  0.001).37 some studies showed
that sibutramine can prevent weight regain after short-term
(1–3 months) very-low-calorie diet.38,39 in these patients,
treatment with sibutramine for 12–18 months maintained
weight loss in a higher proportion of patients than placebo.38,39
in some of these studies, sibutramine induced additional
weight loss and a reduction in waist circumference.38 a very
recent review on clinical trials of weight loss maintenance
revealed that treatment with sibutramine combined with
lifestyle measures was efficacious in reducing weight regain
after weight loss.40
it should be mentioned that when sibutramine is combined
with behavior therapy the resulting weight loss appears to be
more pronounced. in a study in 53 obese women, combining
sibutramine (10 to 15 mg/day for one year) with behavior
therapy or portion-controlled diet induced greater reductions
in body weight than sibutramine alone.41 in a larger study
in 224 obese patients, sibutramine (10 to 15 mg/day for one
year) with behavior therapy resulted in greater weight loss
than either sibutramine or behavior therapy alone.42 the
prevalence of metabolic syndrome (mets) was also reduced
more in the former group and this was attributed to the greater
weight loss in this group.43
interestingly, some studies showed that intermittent treatment with sibutramine might be as effective as continuous
administration of this agent.44 in 1,001 obese patients,
continuous treatment with sibutramine (15 mg/day) for
48 weeks induced similar weight and waist circumference
reductions with intermittent treatment (sibutramine 15 mg/day
only during weeks 1–12, 19–30 and 37–48).44 in addition, the
proportion of patients experiencing a serious adverse event
was lower in the intermittently treated group.44
it is of interest that weight loss achieved during the first
month of sibutramine treatment was predictive of long-term
weight loss.28,41 a meta-analysis of seven sibutramine studies
(n = 928) showed that a weight loss of 4 kg at three months
was the most sensitive predictor of achieving 5% weight
loss at 12 months.45 it was suggested that it might be reasonable to discontinue sibutramine in patients who do not lose at
least 5% of their body weight within the first 3–6 months.46
however, a swedish study suggested that sibutramine is not

vascular health and risk management 2009:5

sibutramine in obesity and related disorders

discontinued in the majority of patients who do not achieve
this target.47
other predictors of weight loss during sibutramine
treatment were also identified in some reports. in the storm
study, higher body weight at baseline was the only predictor
of greater weight loss at six months and weight maintenance
at 24 months.48 in other studies, higher baseline bmi also
predicted greater weight loss at 4 and 12 months.19 a younger
age, lower depression scores, less restrained eating and lower
energy intake at baseline also appear to predict greater weight
loss.19,49,50 preliminary findings suggest that specific genes
might modulate the response to sibutramine treatment.51–53
in 149 obese women, the gg and aa genotypes of the
 xxxg1791xxx  gene (the ratelimiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis) were associated with greater weight loss with sibutramine than the ag
genotype.51 another study in 111 patients reported that the
gnbeta3 cc genotype predicted 5% weight loss with sibutramine.52 patients with the gnbeta3 tc/tt genotypes derived no
benefit from sibutramine.52 the gnbeta3 gene encodes the  xxxg838xxx 
subunit of the g-proteins, which are the second messengers
of the adrenergic and serotoninergic receptors.52,53 in contrast,
in a more recent study in 181 subjects, the gnbeta3 tc/tt
genotypes were associated with greater weight loss with
sibutramine treatment.53 the alpha2a cc and 5httlpr ls/ss
genotypes and the combinations of these 3 genotypes (gnbeta3
tc/tt, alpha2a cc and 5httlpr ls/ss) were also associated
with greater weight loss.53 the alpha2a and 5httlpr genes
encode the alpha2a adrenoreceptor and the serotonin transporter
protein, respectively.53

sibutramine and cardiometabolic
risk factors
overweight and obesity increase the risk for developing
type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm).5,54 on the other hand, in
patients with impaired glucose tolerance (igt) or impaired
fasting glucose (ifg), weight loss resulting from lifestyle
measures reduced the risk for developing t2dm.55,56 more
importantly, intentional weight loss in overweight diabetic
patients reduced cardiovascular and all cause mortality.57,58
in several studies in obese or overweight diabetic patients,
sibutramine (5–20 mg/day for 12 weeks to six months)
reduced body weight, bmi, waist circumference and body
fat more than placebo.59–62 quality of life also improved in
the sibutramine group, particularly in patients who lost 5%
body weight.61 in a longer-term study, 59 overweight or obese
diabetic were treated with meal replacement products and
intermittent low-calorie diet and were randomized to receive

sibutramine for two years or only sibutramine during the
second year of the study.63 body weight reduction was similar
in the two groups and there was no further weight loss during
the second year of sibutramine treatment.63 meta-analyses
suggested that weight loss with sibutramine is similar in
diabetic and nondiabetic obese patients.34,64 in the study by
rucker and colleagues34 placebo subtracted weight losses
in patients with t2dm averaged 5% and the respective rate
in nondiabetic patients was 4.3%. another meta-analysis in
patients with t2dm showed that sibutramine resulted in a
weight reduction averaging -3.3% and a modest decrease of
glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) by -0.7%.65
sibutramine-induced weight loss is accompanied with
improvements in lipid profile and, in earlier studies, mainly
a substantial increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(hdl-c) levels was observed.28,31,32,37 in the storm study,37
sibutramine treatment for 24 months increased hdl-c
levels more in men than in women (11.2% vs 8.5% more
than placebo, respectively) and similar improvements were
reported in a 12 month study by abfelbaum et al38 the rise in
hdl-c levels was suggested to be greater than that expected
to result from weight loss.37 in two recent meta-analyses
however, it was evident that the effect of the drug on hdl-c
was not so important. hdl-c levels increased by 2.53%66
and 0.04 mmol/l34 more than placebo and these changes
were probably attributable to the weight loss. a decrease in
triglycerides (tg) levels was reported in some sibutramine
studies28,32,37 but not in others.31,33,42 the reduction in tg levels
also correlated with the weight loss.37 a fall in low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) levels was also described28
but this was not confirmed by most reports.31–33,37,42 in a
recent meta-analysis sibutramine reduced tg levels more
than placebo by 0.2 mmol/l.34 changes in ldl-c and hba1c
levels did not differ between groups.34 similar changes in
lipid profile are observed in diabetic patients treated with
sibutramine but there is also an improvement in glycemic
control in this population.67
elevated serum  xxxd3472xxx  levels is frequently present
in obese patients and might be associated with increased
vascular risk.68 in some studies, sibutramine lowered serum
 xxxd3472xxx  levels27,28,38 and this reduction was proportional to
weight loss.27
insulin resistance (ir) coexists very often with central
obesity and weight loss may ameliorate this condition and
associated metabolic disorders.69 in a weight loss nonrandomized study,70 sibutramine ameliorated ir parameters including serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment (homa)
index, serum free  xxxd2154xxx  and tg, before any significant

change of body weight and fat distribution suggesting that,
sibutramine might improve insulin sensitivity directly. other
studies, however, did not confirm this finding but demonstrated that the improvement in ir by the drug was dependent
on weight reduction per se.71,72 until now, a direct action of
sibutramine on ir is not proven.
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is frequently present in
overweight and obese patients and may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) or cirrhosis.73 the fundamental
derangement in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is ir. in
patients with nash, sibutramine reduced transaminase
and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels and induced a regression
in ultrasonography-assessed steatosis.74
inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis
of atherosclerosis.75 overweight and obese patients frequently
have elevated levels of inflammatory markers.76–79 sibutramine reduced high sensitivity  xxxg520xxx  (hscrp)
levels in some studies80,81 but not in others.82 sibutramine
along with diet and exercise reduced the serum levels of the
pro-inflammatory cytokines  xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx )
and  xxxg1181xxx  (il-6) and increased the serum levels of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10.83 these anti-inflammatory
effects were independent of weight loss in some studies80 but
were related to weight loss in others.81,83
leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are important adipokines
and play a role in energy homeostasis, glucose metabolism, and weight regulation.84 in some studies, sibutramine
reduced serum resistin and leptin levels and increased serum
adiponectin levels25,81,83,85 and these effects were associated
with improvements in ir and metabolic risk factors.81,83 the
observed changes in adipokine levels also correlated with
weight loss.25,81,83 however, sibutramine did not affect leptin
or adiponectin levels in other reports.82,86,87
endothelial dysfunction might represent an early stage
of the atherosclerotic process.75 endothelial dysfunction is
frequently present in obese patients and correlates with the
degree of abdominal obesity.88,89 in 80 obese patients with
coronary heart disease (chd), sibutramine (10 mg/day for
four months) improved endothelial function.80 the improvement in endothelial function correlated with the decrease in
hscrp levels but not with the change in body weight.80
left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is associated with
increased vascular and all cause mortality in hypertensive
patients90 and in the general population.90,91 in hypertensive
patients, regression of lvh with antihypertensive treatment
reduces vascular risk.92 lvh appears to be more prevalent in
obese patients than in subjects with normal weight regardless of the presence of hypertension.93,94 in obese patients,

sibutramine (10–20 mg/day for 3–6 months) reduced left
ventricular mass whereas no significant change was observed
in the placebo group.95,96 this reduction correlated with the
decrease in body weight.95

therapeutic use of sibutramine
in obesity-related disorders
obstructive sleep apnea is a disorder frequently observed
in obese patients and is associated with increased risk for
developing hypertension.97,98 in an uncontrolled study in
87 obese patients, sibutramine (10 mg/day for six months)
reduced body weight and improved markers of obstructive sleep apnea severity (respiratory disturbance index
and epworth score).99 there was a significant correlation
between weight loss and the improvement in obstructive
sleep apnea markers.99 in a smaller, shorter-term, placebocontrolled study (20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea
given sibutramine 15 mg/day for one month) sibutramine had
no effect on polysomnographic variables (sleep efficiency
and apnea–hypopnea index).100 however, no change in body
weight was observed in this study.100
polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a complex, frequent
condition affecting 5%–10% of premenopausal women,
characterized by hyperandrogenemia, hirsutism and oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. a substantial proportion of these
patients are overweight or obese and insulin resistant, and
are at high risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease.101 in
two small studies in overweight or obese women with pcos
(total n = 101), sibutramine (10–15 mg/day for six months)
reduced body weight and bmi more than lifestyle modification alone.102,103 triglyceride levels and markers of androgen
excess decreased more in the sibutramine group but menstrual
frequency did not differ significantly between groups.102,103 in
one of these studies insulin sensitivity was also increased.102
in another study in 40 obese women with pcos, sibutramine (10 mg/day) reduced body weight, bmi and markers
of androgen excess to a similar extent as oral  xxxd2054xxx  plus  xxxd1786xxx  (35 µg/2 mg).104 however,
only sibutramine reduced whr and improved insulin
sensitivity.104 on the other hand, hdl-c levels increased
in the  xxxd2054xxx  plus  xxxd1786xxx  group but
remained stable in the sibutramine group.104 combining
sibutramine and  xxxd2054xxx  plus  xxxd1786xxx  did
not provide further benefits over sibutramine monotherapy
except for an increase in hdl-c levels.104 despite these
promising findings, it should be noted that sibutramine is
contraindicated during pregnancy and should be discontinued
in these patients in case of pregnancy. overall, preliminary

data suggest that sibutramine in women with pcos could
represent a therapeutic option, provided that its use is monitored carefully.
the use of several antipsychotic agents is associated with
significant weight gain.105 in a study in 37 obese or overweight
patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated
with olanzapine, sibutramine (5–15 mg/day for 12 weeks)
reduced body weight, bmi, and waist circumference
more than placebo.106 however, three months after the end
of the study, changes from baseline in all these parameters were similar in the two groups.106 in two other reports,
sibutramine (5–20 mg/day for 12 weeks) did not reduce
body weight more than placebo in patients with chronic
schizophrenia treated with olanzapine (n = 28) when
combined with metformin (850–1700 mg/day)107 or in obese
patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated
with clozapine (n = 21) when given alone.108
binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent
binge eating in the absence of inappropriate compensatory
behaviors and/or extreme dietary restraint and is distinguishable from both bulimia nervosa and obesity.109 binge
eating disorder very often results in overweight and obesity.
sibutramine appears to be useful in the management of
these patients. an early, uncontrolled study in 10 patients
reported a reduction in body weight and in the number of
binge eating episodes when sibutramine (15 mg/day) was
given for 12 weeks.110 in placebo-controlled studies (total n =
384), sibutramine (10–15 mg/day for 12–24 weeks) reduced
body weight and the frequency of binge eating episodes more
than placebo.111–113 in one report, depression scores were also
reduced more in the sibutramine group.111
finally, sibutramine was administered in a small group
of obese adults with hypopituitary disease for 11 months.114
it was previously shown that substituted patients with
hypopituitarism have lower sympathoadrenal activity but a
normal energy expenditure when compared with controls.115
therefore, the rationale for using sibutramine in such patients
was that, besides reducing food intake, it could enhance
sympathoadrenal activity and, thus, induce an adequate
weight loss.114 the results of the study showed that obese
patients with hypopituitary disease exhibited the same favorable changes in anthropometric indices, body composition
and metabolic parameters as controls with simple obesity.

approximately 31.9% and that of obesity 16.3%.117 similar
rates were reported in other countries.116,118 in cross-sectional
studies in children and adolescents, overweight is associated
with increased prevalence of ifg, t2dm, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia.120,121 a significant proportion of overweight
children and adolescents will become obese adults.122,123 more
importantly, overweight and obese children and adolescents
have increased risk for chd and all cause mortality.124,125
sibutramine might be useful in obese adolescents.17,126–131
in an early placebo-controlled trial in 82 obese adolescents
receiving behavior therapy and sibutramine (starting dose
5 mg/day and uptitrated to 15 mg/day) the authors demon­
strated a weight reduction significantly higher in the
sibutramine group than in the placebo group (by 4.6 kg)
after six months.17 all participants received sibutramine for
the following six months.17 those who continued to receive
sibutramine gained a mean of 0.8 kg whereas those who
were switched from placebo to sibutramine lost a mean of
1.3 kg (p = 0.057 between groups).17 interestingly, there
was no difference in weight loss at 12 months between
patients given sibutramine for 12 months and those given
sibutramine for six months.17 in another study in 60 obese
adolescents, sibutramine (10 mg/day given for six months)
reduced body weight and bmi by a mean of 7.9 kg and
2.7 kg/m2 respectively more than placebo (p  0.001).127
changes in lipid profile and ir did not differ between groups
in any of these two studies.17,127 in a more recent and larger
study in 498 obese adolescents receiving behavior therapy,
sibutramine (10 mg/day uptitrated to 15 mg/day at six months
if bmi was not reduced by 10%) reduced body weight by
a mean of 8.4 kg and bmi by a mean of 2.9 kg/m2 more than
placebo after 12 months.126 there was also a greater reduction in tg levels and in ir and a larger increase in hdl-c
levels in the sibutramine group.126 a recent meta-analysis
reported a 2.4 kg/m2 (with a 95% confidence interval [ci] of
1.8–3.1) in bmi loss when sibutramine was given to obese
adolescents.128 in this meta-analysis, adolescents taking the
drug had higher rates of elevated blood pressure (bp) and
pulse rate than adolescents taking placebo.128
the usefulness of sibutramine was tested in children
with hypothalamic obesity. these patients have multiple
pituitary hormone deficiencies due to hypothalamic genetic
disorders or hypothalamic damage from tumor, surgery and/
or irradiation, resulting in intractable weight gain resistant
to conventional therapeutic measures.129 although different
therapeutic strategies have been attempted in hypothalamic
obesity, successful treatment has been rarely achieved.129,130
in a placebo-controlled study in 50 children and adolescents,

7–20 years of age, with hypothalamic obesity or obesity
with aggravating syndromes (mental retardation, autism
or attention deficiency hyperactivity disorder), sibutramine
(10–15 mg/day for 20 weeks) reduced bmi sd score value
significantly as well as body fat and was well tolerated.131
however, discontinuation of sibutramine was followed by
regain of 60% of the weight loss.131
it should be noted that sibutramine is currently indicated
only in patients 16 years of age. moreover, current guidelines recommend lifestyle measures as first-line treatment
in obese children and adolescents.132 if these modifications
are ineffective, medication can be considered in specialized
centers in children 11 years of age with bmi of 95th
percentile and significant comorbidities or with bmi
of 99th percentile.132

comparative studies
with other antiobesity agents
sibutramine and orlistat are the only approved agents for the
long-term management of obesity and a number of studies
compared these agents. sibutramine (10–20 mg/day for
12 weeks to 12 months) reduced body weight and bmi more
than orlistat (360 mg/day) in three studies in obese patients
(total n = 325).133–135 however, in two other studies (total
n = 259), sibutramine (10 mg/day given for 12–24 weeks)
and orlistat (360 mg/day) induced similar reductions in body
weight, bmi, and waist circumference.136,137 in another study
in 115 hypertensive obese patients, sibutramine (10 mg/day
given for 12 months) and orlistat (360 mg/day) reduced
body weight, bmi, waist circumference and whr to a similar
extent.138 a recent meta-analysis of seven studies comparing
head-to head sibutramine with orlistat (n = 851) reported a
2.2 kg greater weight loss with sibutramine.139 changes in
lipid profile appear to be similar with these two agents.135,136,138
however, there was a greater improvement in depression
score in patients assigned to sibutramine.137 in most studies,
bp fell in the orlistat group and did not change or increased
in the sibutramine group.135,136,138,140 however, total adverse
events were fewer in the sibutramine-allocated group.138,140
combining sibutramine and orlistat (10 mg and 360 mg/day,
respectively, for 3–6 months) did not provide additional
benefits over sibutramine monotherapy in obese patients.133,134
interestingly, a small study in 34 women who had received
sibutramine for one year showed that adding orlistat to
sibutramine for 16 weeks did not induce further weight
loss.141 in another study in 198 obese patients, combining
sibutramine with an experimental selective antagonist of the
receptor 5 of the orexigenic  xxxg1590xxx  did not result

safety considerations
obesity increases the risk for developing hypertension.5,142,143
in addition, hypertension is more prevalent in overweight
and obese individuals. weight loss resulting from lifestyle
modifications lowers bp and also reduces the risk for developing hypertension.144,145 in contrast, sibutramine increased
bp levels compared with placebo in several trials despite
the reduction in body weight.37,62 other studies reported
an increase only in diastolic bp (dbp) and not in systolic
bp (sbp)27,146 and some no change in bp levels.42,44,59–61
a meta-analysis reported a significant increase in sbp and
dbp levels (by 1.6 and 2.4 mmhg, respectively) in patients
treated with sibutramine.34 another meta-analysis reported
that the increase in both sbp and dbp appears to be greater
when the initial body weight is 92 kg.29
sibutramine increases bp levels due to a peripheral sympathomimetic effect.146–149 sibutramine stimulated the expression of  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg836xxx  adrenoreceptor genes in adipose tissue and
increased plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels.142
interestingly, sibutramine also exerts a central sympatholytic
action, which might blunt its peripheral sympathomimetic
effects.146–149
sibutramine (10–20 mg/day for 12–52 weeks) was
administered to hypertensive patients in several clinical
studies and reduced body weight, bmi, waist circumference and whr more than placebo.87,138,150–153 in addition,
sibutramine reduced tg and  xxxd3472xxx  levels and increased
hdl-c levels.150,151,153 quality of life also improved in the
sibutramine group.150 in a recent meta-analysis of sibutramine
studies in hypertensive patients, sibutramine reduced body
weight by 3.7 kg more than placebo.154 subgroup analyses
in other meta-analyses suggested that weight loss with
sibutramine is similar in hypertensive and normotensive
obese patients.34,64 even though sibutramine increased bp
when given to hypertensive patients,150–152 it did not compromise bp control when hypertension was well controlled
with  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors,151 calcium
channel blockers,150 or beta blockers.152 it was also reported
that the sibutramine-induced increase in bp is not greater in
hypertensive patients.146 however, it should be emphasized
that regular monitoring of bp and pulse rate is recommended
in patients given sibutramine. in addition, sibutramine should
be given with caution in patients with controlled hypertension and is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled
hypertension.

vascular health and risk management 2009:5

sibutramine in obesity and related disorders

increased heart rate is another side effect of sibutramine
and was observed in most studies.27,32,33,37,59,61 a meta-analysis
reported an increase in pulse rate by 4.5 beats/min in sibutramine-treated patients.34 in the general population, elevated
heart rate is associated with increased vascular risk.155,156 but
it is not clear whether the sibutramine-induced increase in
heart rate is also harmful.
recently, treatment with sibutramine was associated in
rare cases with qt interval prolongation which could lead
to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.157,158 therefore,
monitoring of the electrocardiogram might be indicated in
patients treated with sibutramine.157 in addition, concomitant
use of sibutramine with other drugs likely to prolong qt
(eg, certain antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antiarrhythmic agents) should probably be avoided.157
dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and insomnia are other
side effects of sibutramine.27,30,31,34
overall, sibutramine is contraindicated in patients with
established coronary heart disease, previous stroke, heart
failure, or cardiac arrhythmias.30 in addition, it should not be
administered to patients receiving  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sumatriptan,
dihydroergotamine, meperidine, methadone, pentazocine,
fentanyl, lithium or tryptophan.13,30 however, a swedish study
reported that 28% of the patients prescribed sibutramine had
one or more contraindications to its use.47
in the larger sibutramine studies, discontinuation rates
at one and two years of treatment were 19%–49% and 42%,
respectively.27,37,44 drop-out rates at one and two years were
similarly high in the placebo groups in the latter studies
(27%–51% and 50%, respectively).27,37,44 interestingly, a
population-based study suggested that these rates might
be even higher in clinical practice.159 persistence rates at
six months, one and two years were 26%, 8%, and 2%,
respectively.159 in the same study, approximately 60% of
the patients did not fill in a second prescription of sibutramine. 159 in other population studies, 41.8%–59.1% of the
patients had stopped sibutramine within three months of
starting treatment.160,161 besides side effects, perceived low
efficacy and cost might explain these high discontinuation
rates.159–161
the ongoing sibutramine cardiovascular outcome trial
(scout) will assess the effect of sibutramine (10–15 mg/day)
on vascular events in 9,000 obese and overweight patients
with either established vascular disease or t2dm and another
vascular risk factor.162 preliminary safety results showed
that sibutramine was safe and well tolerated in this high-risk
population.163

conclusions
sibutramine, a selective inhibitor of central neuronal reuptake
of serotonine and noradrenaline, reduces food intake and
body weight more than placebo and has beneficial effects on
the lipid profile, glycemic control and inflammatory markers
in studies for up to one year. the drug may be beneficial in
obese patients with metabolic disturbances in cases where

a lack of satiety or frequent snacking is an obstacle and
limits weight reduction. preliminary studies showed that
sibutramine could be used in specific pathological situations
such as polycystic ovary syndrome, sleep apnea syndrome,
hypothalamic obesity and in obese adolescents. however,
the increase in bp and pulse rate raises safety concerns. the
high discontinuation rate should also be noticed. another
major limitation of sibutramine is that significant weight
regain is frequently observed after treatment discontinuation.
this implies that treatment with this agent should be long
term, if not lifelong, if we aspire to sustained reductions in
weight. however, most of the weight loss during sibutramine
treatment occurs during the first six months of treatment and
little additional weight loss is observed afterwards. moreover,
there are no sibutramine studies longer than two years and
accordingly sibutramine is approved for use only for a limited
period of time. finally, it is unclear whether treatment with
sibutramine will reduce cardiovascular events.
until more conclusive evidence on the efficacy and safety
of sibutramine are available, lifestyle measures should remain
the mainstay of the management of obesity.
