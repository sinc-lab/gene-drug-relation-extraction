interaction of local anaesthetic agents with the endogenous  xxxg2148xxx  in sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells.  use of intravenous  xxxd2243xxx  for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type i is of variable efficacy.  xxxd2243xxx  injection is painful, so local anaesthetic is co-administered. we hypothesize that local anaesthetic inhibits uptake of  xxxd2243xxx  and hence reduces its efficacy. in this study we have examined the effects of a range of local anaesthetic agents on the uptake of [3h]norepinephrine ([3h]ne) (as a surrogate for  xxxd2243xxx ) and the binding of [3h]nisoxetine to the ne transporter in cultured sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells. all local anaesthetic agents inhibited ne uptake with a rank order cocaine>tetracaine>procaine(esters),  xxxd1869xxx  >  xxxd383xxx  > prilocaine > lidocaine (amides). in addition all anaesthetic agents displaced [3h]nisoxetine with a rank order cocaine > tetracaine >  xxxd1869xxx  > procaine > prilocaine >  xxxd383xxx  > lidocaine. there was a positive correlation between [3h]ne uptake and [3h]nisoxetine binding. our data suggest that when local anaesthetic and  xxxd2243xxx  are co-administered the former may reduce uptake of the latter and hence reduce the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2243xxx .
