1. introduction
 xxxd3562xxx  is a new 5-ht1br1d receptor partial agonist žmartin et al., 1997. that has recently been approved
for use in the acute treatment of migraine. activation of
the trigemino-vascular system is believed to be a key step
in the initiation of migraine headache žmoskowitz, 1984;
goadsby et al., 1991.. therefore, like dihydroergotamine
and other triptans,  xxxd3562xxx  inhibits trigeminal activation centrally as well as peripherally. access to the central
nervous system contributes to the effect of 5-ht1br1d
receptor agonists žgoadsby and edvinsson, 1994; goadsby
and hoskin, 1996; goadsby and knight, 1997. by reducing
the excitability of central trigeminal neurons and thus

nociception, of which the second-order neurons reside in
the brain stem trigeminal nucleus caudalis žhoskin et al.,
1996.. moreover, trigeminal ganglion neurons could represent another key site of action for 5-ht1br1d receptor
agonists žjohn et al., 1999., in addition to the peripheral
sensory nerve–vessel interface and central trigeminal nucleus caudalis. collectively, activation of 5-ht1br1d receptors reduce central and peripheral neuronal excitability
žgoadsby and hoskin, 1996; martin, 1996; martin et al.,
1997. by aborting sensory neuronal firing in the
trigemino-vascular system.
in a previous report, we proposed that the cellular
mechanism that reduces neuronal excitability following
5-ht1br1d receptor activation by sumatriptan was mediated by an increase of an hyperpolarizing kq current žle
grand et al., 1998. indicating that recombinant human
5-ht1b receptors are positively coupled to ca2q-dependent
kq channels žle grand et al., 1998.. the outward kq

current mediated by these channels is known to mediate
hyperpolarization žsah, 1996. and to play a key role in
regulating neuronal excitability. therefore, the aim of the
present study was to investigate whether  xxxd3562xxx , a
5-ht1br1d receptor partial agonist žmartin et al., 1997.,
could similarly stimulate a ca2q-dependent kq current
following human  xxxg1109xxx  activation.

2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture
c6 glioma cells žatcc, cl 107, rat. transfected žor
not. with the human  xxxg1109xxx  gene were cultured
in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium ždmem. supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum as previously
described žpauwels et al., 1996.. they were plated in small
volume chambers ž100–200 ml. 48–96 h before use.
2.2. whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
outward kq currents ž i k . were measured at room
temperature ž20–248c. using the patch-clamp technique in
the whole-cell configuration. pipettes with resistance of
3–5 m v were pulled from pyrex capillaries not fire
polished before use. a flow of solution ž50–100 mlrmin.
from one of a series of five outlets continuously superfused the cell from which a recording was being made. a
patch clamp amplifier žaxopatch 200a, axon instruments,
foster city, ca, usa. was used. the resistance in series
with the cell membrane was compensated using dynamic
series resistance control compensation to provide the fastest
possible capacity transient without ringing. neither capacitive current nor leakage current was compensated. the cell
capacitance was calculated as the ratio of the numerical
integration of the averaged current transient žtotal charge.
to the magnitude of the hyperpolarising pulse. cell currents were further digitized at 1.6 khz and analysed with a
computer ždesk-pro 486r33 m, compaq, houston, usa.
with interactive software žacquis1, g. sadoc, paris,
france..
cells were maintained at a holding potential of y60
mv. for these measurements, naq current was inhibited
by replacing nacl by equimolar choline chloride. the

d-žq.glucose 10; ph adjusted to 7.4 with koh. atropine
sulphate was employed to rule out any activation of muscarinic receptors by choline chloride. the internal solution
contained žin mm.: k-aspartate 115, kcl 10, mgcl 2 3,

4.1. inõolõement of the transfected human  xxxg1109xxx 

in a previous study, we demonstrated that activation of
human 5-ht1b receptors produces an increase in ca2q-dependent kq current. therefore, the nature of the  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in outward current in transfected c6
cells was then explored.  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in
i k were prevented by iberiotoxin ž0.1 mm., a specific
blocker of calcium-activated kq channels and by tetraethylammonium žtea, 1mm., a non-specific blocker of
calcium-activated kq channels žfig. 3a; 4.5 " 7.3%, n s 5
and y0.8 " 1.7%, n s 4, respectively, p s ns in each
case.. in addition,  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in i k

 xxxd3562xxx  1 mm, n s 4, p s ns and y4.2 " 2.4% with

results indicate that  xxxd3562xxx -mediated an increase in
i k occur in a ca2q-dependent manner ž i krca ..

in c6 glioma cells stably expressing cloned human
5-ht1b receptors,  xxxd3562xxx  concentration-dependently
increased i kr ca . the absence of  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in i kr ca in non-transfected c6 cells provides firm
evidence for a specific involvement of human 5-ht1b
receptors in mediating  xxxd3562xxx  current responses in
transfected cells. in addition, this observation excludes any
involvement of native 5-ht2arc receptors known to stimulate i kr ca in c6 glioma cells žmanor et al., 1992; elliot et
al., 1995.. the potency value obtained for  xxxd3562xxx  in
augmenting i kr ca following activation of human 5-ht1b
receptors žp d 2 7.03. is in agreement with potency values
reported for inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation žp d 2 7.51; pauwels et al., 1997. and enhancement of specific gtpg35 s binding žp d 2 7.22; pauwels et
al., 1997, 1998.. the potency value reported for activation
of i kr ca in transfected c6 glioma cells is also consistent
with potency values reported for  xxxd3562xxx -induced contraction of primate basilar artery žp d 2 6.92; martin et al.,
1997., human epicardial coronary artery žp d 2 7.3; martin
et al., 1997. and rabbit saphenous vein rings žp d 2 6.79;
martin et al., 1997. consecutive to activation of 5-ht1b
receptors. in addition, the potency value and the maximum
i k increases obtained for  xxxd3562xxx  žp d 2 7.03, maximum increase 16.3 " 7.8%. are in the same rank of order
with that obtained for sumatriptan žp d 2 7.21, maximum
i k increase 19.4 " 7.2%; le grand et al., 1998.. in the
presence of gr 127935, a mixed 5-ht1br1d receptor
antagonist,  xxxd3562xxx  failed to significantly increase
i kr ca in c6 glioma cells stably transfected with the human
 xxxg1109xxx . collectively, these results demonstrate
that  xxxd3562xxx  stimulates i kr ca following activation of
recombinant human 5-ht1b receptors.

4. discussion

4.2. stimulation of ik r c a in transfected c6 glioma cells

in c6 glioma cells stably expressing cloned human
5-ht1b receptors,  xxxd3562xxx  increased an outward kq
current that required ca2q ions for activation ž i kr ca .. the
relatively selective 5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist gr
127935 žclitherow et al., 1994. prevented  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in i kr ca . when egta was included in the
patch pipette,  xxxd3562xxx  failed to enhance i kr ca . in
addition, the ca2q-dependent kq channel blockers iberiotoxin and tea abolished  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases
in i kr ca . collectively, our findings indicate that  xxxd3562xxx , a 5-ht1br1d receptor partial agonist stimulated a
ca2q-dependent kq current in c6 glioma cells stably
expressing recombinant human 5-ht1b receptors. the data
confirm previous findings in which human 5-ht1b receptors were shown to be positively coupled to ca2q-dependent kq channels žle grand et al., 1998..

the present data indicate that  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in i kr ca in c6 glioma cells are sensitive to blockade by iberiotoxin, a specific blocker calcium-activated
kq channels, and by tea, a non-specific blocker of
calcium-activated kq channels. these observations are in
close agreement with our results which show that
 xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in i kr ca were significantly
reduced by dialysing cells with the calcium chelator,
egta. this indicates that in c6 glioma cells,  xxxd3562xxx -evoked increases in i kr ca can be activated by small
changes in intracellular free ca2q concentrations, in agreement with activation of a specific i kr ca žxia et al., 1998..
such positive coupling of 5-ht1b receptors to ca2q-dependent kq channels therefore requires ca2q release from
intracellular stores. thus, increases in intracellular free
ca2q concentrations consecutive to human 5-ht1b activa-

the mixed 5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist, gr 127935
žclitherow et al., 1994., per se had no effect on i k in
either non-transfected c6 glioma cells žy1.2 " 1.3%, n s
5, ns., or those transfected with the human  xxxg1109xxx  gene ž3.2 " 3.5%, n s 5, ns.. in c6 glioma cells
expressing human 5-ht1b receptors, gr 127935 ž0.1 mm.
significantly reduced  xxxd3562xxx  ž1 mm.-evoked increases in i k žfig. 2b, n s 5.. these results provide
further evidence that  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in i k
in transfected c6 glioma cells were mediated by human
5-ht1b receptors.

by  xxxd3562xxx  in c6 glioma cells

tion by sumatriptan, another 5-ht1br1d receptor partial
agonist, in c6 glioma cells resulted from the internal
liberation of ca2q ions from thapsigargin-sensitive ca2q
stores žle grand et al., 1998.. in addition, blockade of
sumatriptan-induced increases in i kr ca by heparin žle
grand et al., 1998., an insp3 receptor blocker žkobayashi
et al., 1988; hirose and iino, 1994., clearly suggests that
inositol phospholipid hydrolysis is the major signalling
pathway by which increases in intracellular free ca2q
concentrations occur consecutive to human  xxxg1109xxx  activation by sumatriptan in c6 glioma cells. therefore, an identical positive signalling pathway between
phospholipid hydrolysis and ca2q-dependent kq channel
opening also occurs following activation of the human
 xxxg1109xxx  by  xxxd3562xxx .
a consequence of  xxxd3562xxx -induced increases in
ca2q-dependent kq current following  xxxg1109xxx 
activation could be membrane hyperpolarization. this
could constitute a potential mechanism by which  xxxd3562xxx  reduces neuronal excitability žgoadsby and hoskin,
1996; martin et al., 1997; werhahn et al., 1998.. thus,
5-ht1br1d receptor mrna žbruinvels et al., 1992;
bouchelet et al., 1996. and immunoreactivity žlongmore
et al., 1997. have been detected in trigeminal neurons, both
peripherally and centrally, suggesting that these receptors
may be involved in the modulation of trigeminal nociceptive neurotransmission. in isolated guinea-pig trigeminal
ganglion neurons, ca2q-dependent kq currents involved
in regulating excitability were increased by the 5-ht1br1d
receptor agonists, sumatriptan and f 11356 žjohn et al.,
1999.. therefore, a native system that constitutively expresses 5-ht1br1d receptors has therefore been reported to
exhibit identical coupling with ca2q-dependent kq channels. in addition, current-clamp experiments conducted in
trigeminal ganglion neurons showed that activation of
5-ht1br1d receptors by sumatriptan induced an hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential žy2.4 " 0.8
mv, n s 5, unpublished data.. however, further studies
are required to clearly identify which receptor subtype,
5-ht1b ,  xxxg1110xxx  or both, modulates electrical activity in
the trigemino-vascular system. nevertheless, activation of
5-ht1br1d receptors by  xxxd3562xxx  significantly reduced
firing probability of trigeminal neurons žgoadsby and
hoskin, 1996.. it is well-established that reduction of
cellular firing frequently results from neuronal hyperpolarization. stimulation of i kr ca is therefore one possible,
major mechanism by which hyperpolarization can be induced žsah, 1996; xia et al., 1998.. increases in i kr ca
following activation of 5-ht1b receptors is thus a potential
key mechanism that could explain reduction of cellular
firing and neuronal excitability.
in conclusion, the present findings provide evidence
that the 5-ht1br1d receptor partial agonist,  xxxd3562xxx ,
like sumatriptan, stimulates i kr ca in c6 glioma cells
stably transfected with human 5-ht1b receptors suggesting
increases in hyperpolarizing current.
