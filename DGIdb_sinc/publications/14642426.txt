abstract
the effect of ginseng saponins on plasma interleukin-6 (il-6) in non-stressed and immobilization-stressed mice were investigated.
ginseng total saponins, ginsenosides rb2, rg1 and rd administered intraperitoneally attenuated the immobilization stress-induced increase
in plasma il-6 level. but, intracerebroventricular injection of each ginsenoside did not affect plasma il-6 level induced by immobilization
stress. ginsenosides rb2, rd and rg1 significantly decreased norepinephrine and/or epinephrine-induced increase of il-6 level in
macrophage cell line (raw 264.7). thus, it can be suggested that the inhibitory action of ginseng saponins against the immobilization stressinduced increase of plasma il-6 level would be in periphery; at least in part, mediated by blocking norepinephrine- and/or epinephrineinduced increase of il-6 level in macrophage rather than in the brain. ginseng saponins might be proposed as a possible candidate in the
research or therapeutic modulation of stress-related disorders.

ginseng, the root of  xxxd2200xxx  c.a. meyer (araliaceae)
as a folk medicine has been used for thousands of years in
asian countries. the major active ingredients of ginseng
have been demonstrated to be ginseng saponins which are
composed of various ginsenosides [3,4,11]. many reports
made it evident that ginseng saponins exert various effects
on stress and immune system [6,7,10,19].
interleukin-6 (il-6) is a multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cells, including immune cells
(macrophage, t cell and b cell), fibroblasts, endothelial
cells, neurons and glial cells, in response to infection,
trauma and stress [1,2]. it has been well known that stress
increases plasma il-6 and corticosterone (or cortisol) level
[13]. previously, we showed that ginseng saponins inhibited
stress-induced plasma corticosterone level in mice [7].
however, there has not been any report about effect of
ginseng saponins on plasma il-6 level under stress. thus,

we investigated the effect of ginseng saponins on plasma  xxxg1181xxx  in non-stressed and immobilization-stressed mice in the
present study.
male icr mice weighing 25 – 30 g, supplied by myungjin, inc. (seoul, korea), were used for all the experiments.
the animals were housed five per cage in a room maintained
at 22 ^ 18c with an alternating 12-h light-dark cycle. food
and water were available ad libitum. ginseng total saponins
(gts), ginsenoside rb1, rb2, rc, rd, re, rf, rg1, rg2,
rh1 and rh2 were supplied by the korea ginseng and
tobacco research institute (deajon, korea). gts was
composed of rb1 (16.6%), rb2 (5.4%), rc (4.35%), rd
(1.2%), re (2.5%), rf (0.55%), rg1 (2.5%), rg2 (4.1%) and
rh1 (0.3%). gts, ginsenoside rb1, rb2, rc, rd, re, rf,
rg1, rg2, rh1 and rh2 were dissolved in sterile saline
(0.9% nacl) for intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection. control animals received saline.
the i.c.v. administration followed the method described by
laursen and belknap [9]. briefly, the animal was injected at
bregma with a 50 ml hamilton syringe fitted with 26-ga.
needle of which the tip was adjusted to be inserted 2.4 mm

deep. the i.c.v. injection volume was 5 ml and injection
sites were verified by injecting the same volume of 1%
 xxxd2610xxx  and then observing the distribution of the
injected drugs or dye in the ventricular space. the dye
injected i.c.v. was found to be distributed in the ventricular
spaces and ventral surface of the brain and in the upper
cervical portion of the spinal cord. the immobilization
stress procedure consisted of restraint of each animal in a
50-ml corning tube, with the nose of the mouse at the tip of
the tube. adequate ventilation was provided by means of a
hole at the tip of the tube. the plasma il-6 level was
determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa) kit (genzyme, cambridge, ma). assays were
performed exactly as described by the manufacturers. the
detection limit of the assay was 5 pg/ml. four hundred ml of
blood was collected by puncturing the retro-orbital venous
plexus. plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored
at 2 808c until assayed. the murine macrophage cell line
raw 264.7 was cultured in peri dishes (falcon, becton
dickinson, heidelberg, germany) in crpmi-1640 media
(rpmi-1640 containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf
serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 u/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2.5 g/l glucose) at 378c and 5%
co2. one day prior to the experiment, the mice caged in
groups of five were allowed to be acclimatized to the
condition of a quiet laboratory room overnight. intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections
were performed between 09:00 and 11:00 h each day to
avoid the diurnal variation of plasma corticosterone levels.
each mouse was bled once and sacrificed. when a mouse
was bled from the orbital plexus and killed, other remaining
mice were separated to avoid visual and auditory
stimulation.
in the previous experiments on the time course of plasma
il-6 rise under immobilization stress, it was shown that the
plasma il-6 level was elevated from the baseline value as
the duration of stress increased and reached a maximum
after 120 min of immobilization [14]. for the investigation
of ginseng’s effect on plasma il-6 in basal state, various
doses (10 –20 mg/kg) of ginseng total saponins (gts) were
injected i.p. and blood was collected 70 min after injection.
in the experiment to examine the effect of ginseng on
plasma il-6 during immobilization stress, various dose of
gts (1 – 20 mg/kg) were injected i.p. and 10 min later,
immobilization stress was applied for 60 min. to determine
the active ginsenosides that can affect the stress-induced
plasma il-6 level, various doses of each ginsenoside (rb1,
rb2, rc, rd, re, rf, rg1, rg2, rh1 and rh2) were injected
i.p. (0.1 – 1 mg/kg, respectively) or i.c.v. (1 mg, respectively)
and 10 min later, immobilization stress was applied for 60
min. immediately after the completion of immobilization
stress, blood was collected for the assays of plasma il-6. to
explore the effect of ginsenosides on stress-induced il-6
release in macrophage cell line, raw 264.7 cells (1 £ 106)
were seeded into the wells of 24-well-plates. cells were
cultured in medium containing norepinephrine or epineph-

rine (10 mm, respectively) with or without a ginsenoside (10
mm) to test for 24 h. then, the concentration of il-6 in
culture supernatants was determined using a mouse il-6
elisa kit. statistical analysis was carried out by using
student t-test or one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc
bonferroni test. p values less than 0.05 were considered to
indicate statistical significance.
in the experiment to investigate the effect of gts
injected i.p. on plasma il-6 in non-stressed and immobilization-stressed mice, gts did not affect plasma il-6 level
in intact mice. but, gts (5 – 20 mg/kg) effectively
attenuated the plasma il-6 increase during immobilization
stress (fig. 1). in the study to determine the active
ginsenosides that can inhibit the immobilization stressinduced plasma il-6 level, ginsenoside rb2, rd and rg1 (1
mg/kg, i.p., respectively) significantly inhibited the immobilization stress-induced plasma il-6 level (fig. 2). but, i.p.
injected ginsenosides rb1, rc, re, rf, rg2, rh1 and rh2
were ineffective at the doses of 0.1 – 1 mg/kg (data not
shown). in the experiment to examine the effect of each
ginsenoside injected i.c.v. on plasma il-6 level, each
ginsenoside used in this experiment did not affect the
plasma il-6 increase during immobilization stress (data not
shown).
it is well known that macrophage is one of the major cells
to secrete il-6 and immobilization stress increase plasma
catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine). the
catecholamine systems are involved in the increase of
plasma il-6 level induced by several cns stimuli such as
stress [15,20]. thus, to explore the possible mechanism of
ginseng saponins in the inhibitory effect on il-6 during
stress, we studied effect of ginsenosides rb2, rd and rg1 on
the norepinephrine or epinephrine-induced il-6 release in
murine macrophage cell line (raw 264.7). ginsenosides
rb2 and rd significantly decreased il-6 level in basal state
macrophage and effectively decreased the norepinephrineand epinephrine-induced il-6 release as well. ginsenoside

rg1 effectively blocked epinephrine- but not norepinephrine-induced il-6 release (fig. 3).
the present study shows that ginseng total saponins,
ginsenosides rb2, rd and rg1 administered i.p. attenuated
the immobilization stress-induced increase in plasma il-6
level. but, i.c.v. injection of each ginsenoside did not affect
the increase of il-6 induced by immobilization stress. this
observation suggests that the action site of ginseng saponins
in the regulation of il-6 level would be in periphery rather
than in the brain. the peripheral noradrenergic system has
been implicated in various stimuli-induced peripheral il-6
responses [19]. immobilization stress is well known to
increase norepinephrine and epinephrine in sympathetic
neuron and/or adrenal gland. the present study showed that

without ginsenoside rb2, rd and rg1 (10 mm, respectively) for 24 h. then,
the concentration of il-6 in culture supernatants were measured.

ginsenosides rb2, rd and rg1 significantly decreased
norepinephrine- and/or epinephrine-induced increase of  xxxg1181xxx  level in macrophage cell line. thus, it can be suggested
that the inhibitory action of ginseng saponins against the
immobilization stress-induced increase of plasma il-6 level
would be, at least in part, mediated by blocking norepinephrine- and/or epinephrine-induced increase of il-6 level
in macrophage. however, we cannot exclude other source of
il-6 release such as b cell, t cell, fibroblast and bonemarrow stromal cell, etc. moreover, there is also another
possibility that ginseng saponins might affect sympathetic

16

nerve innervation and the release of norepinephrine or
epinephrine might be modified by ginseng saponins.
in the present study, ginsenosides rb2 and rd potently
decreased basal il-6 level in macrophage cell line. it was
reported that ginseng saponins exerted inhibitory effect on
il-6 gene expression in chronic inflammation model of rats
[21] and also suppress  xxxg1559xxx  activation which is shown to
be related with il-6 gene expression [5,16,18,22]. thus, we
can speculate that ginsenosides may affect gene expression
related with il-6 production. this hypothesis needs to be
further clarified in the future.
another well known stress hormone is corticosterone
which can suppress plasma il-6 level [13]. the suppressive
action of ginseng saponins in the regulation of plasma il-6
level would be secondary effect of the plasma corticosterone
level affected by ginseng saponins. however, we observed
that increase of plasma corticosterone induced by immobilization stress was inhibited effectively by gts injected
i.p. [8]. thus, we can exclude the possible involvement of
corticosterone in the inhibitory effect of ginseng saponins on
plasma il-6 level during stress. in addition, even though
increase of plasma corticosterone by immobilization stress
was inhibited effectively by gts, different kind of ginsenoside – only ginsenoside rc – was effective in the regulation
of plasma corticosterone level [8]. these findings suggest
that ginsenosides may be involved in the regulation of
corticosterone and il-6 level during stress with different
mechanisms.
il-6 is a potent activator of the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis on all levels in humans, and appears to play a
pathogenic role in conditions related to stress [12,17]. thus,
our research might suggest that ginseng saponins may be
proposed as a possible candidate in the research or
therapeutic modulation of stress-related disorders.
