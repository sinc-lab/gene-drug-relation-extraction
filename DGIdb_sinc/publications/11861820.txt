 xxxd2611xxx  (mdma; “ecstasy”)
has received considerable recent attention due to both its
recreational use and neurotoxic potential. its abuse has increased dramatically over the past several years. for instance, the percentage of 8th-graders reporting having used
mdma in the previous year increased from 1.7% in 1999 to
3.1% in 2000. among high school seniors, usage increased
from 5.6 to 8.2% (johnston et al., 2000). hence, an understanding of the consequences associated with administration
of this stimulant/hallucinogen is important.
many investigators have shown that high-dose administrations of amphetamine analogs, including mdma, cause persistent changes in monoaminergic neuronal function, but
with varying expressions. for example, multiple injections of
methamphetamine (meth) cause dopamine (da) deficits
persisting weeks and months after drug treatment (koda and
gibb, 1973; seiden et al., 1976; hotchkiss et al., 1979; morgan and gibb, 1980; eisch et al., 1992). in contrast, mdma is

decrease in binding of the dat ligand win35428, and 2) neither
prevention of hyperthermia nor prior depletion of da prevented
the mdma-induced reduction in plasmalemmal da transport.
however, a role for phosphorylation was suggested because pretreatment with protein kinase c inhibitors attenuated the deficit
caused by mdma in an in vitro model system. in addition to
affecting dat function, mdma rapidly decreased vesicular da
transport as assessed in striatal vesicles prepared from treated
rats. unlike effects of multiple meth injections reported previously, this decrease partially recovered by 24 h after drug treatment. taken together, these results reveal several differences
between effects of mdma and previously reported meth on dat
and  xxxg2099xxx -2; differences that may underlie the dissimilar neurotoxic profile of these agents.

far less toxic to da systems (johnson et al., 1988; insel et al.,
1989). in addition, we demonstrated recently that multiple
high-dose injections of each of these agents also cause a rapid
(within 1 h) decrease in plasmalemmal  xxxg2149xxx  (dat)
function (fleckenstein et al., 1997; kokoshka et al., 1998;
metzger et al., 1998). we and others have demonstrated that
high-dose meth administration rapidly decreases vesicular
monoamine transport, as assessed in purified striatal vesicles prepared from treated rats (brown et al., 2000, 2001;
hogan et al., 2000). the acute effects of meth are not due to
residual drug introduced by the original drug treatment (kokoshka et al., 1998). effects of mdma on vesicular transport
have not been reported.
the dat is a principal regulator of da disposition (i.e., of
intra- and extraneuronal da concentrations), and changes in
da disposition resulting from amphetamine analogs putatively contribute to their ability to cause long-term da deficits in the striatum. in particular, we (for review, see fleckenstein et al., 2000) and others (cubells et al., 1994;
fumagalli et al., 1999; lavoie and hastings, 1999) have
hypothesized that psychostimulants may redistribute da

abstract
administration of a high-dose regimen of methamphetamine
(meth) rapidly and profoundly decreases plasmalemmal and vesicular dopamine (da) transport in the striatum, as assessed in
synaptosomes and purified vesicles, respectively. to determine
whether these responses were common to other amphetamines
of abuse, effects of  xxxd2611xxx  (mdma)
on the plasmalemmal  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) and vesicular  xxxg2099xxx -2 ( xxxg2099xxx -2) were assessed. similar to effects of
meth reported previously, multiple high-dose mdma administrations rapidly (within 1 h) decreased plasmalemmal da uptake, as
assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats.
unlike effects of multiple meth injections, this deficit was reversed completely 24 h after drug treatment. also in contrast to
effects of multiple meth injections, 1) mdma caused little or no

animals. male sprague-dawley rats (270 –350 g; simonsen labs,
gilroy, ca) were maintained under controlled light and temperature
conditions, with food and water provided ad libitum. on the day of
the experiment, rats were housed in groups (usually eight per cage)
in plastic cages and were maintained in an ambient temperature of
24°c. sixteen rats were used in each treatment group. where indicated in figure legends, some cages were placed in a cool environment
(ambient temperature 6°c) upon treatment with mdma or saline to
manipulate body temperature (i.e., to prevent the hyperthermia
caused by mdma treatment). core (rectal) body temperatures were
recorded using a digital thermometer (physiotemp instruments,
clifton, nj) in all experiments in which ambient temperature was
manipulated. for experiments in which rats received multiple administrations of mdma, rectal temperatures were recorded immediately before the first mdma or saline administration (t ⫽ 0 h) and
every hour thereafter (t ⫽ 0 –7 h). drugs were administered as
indicated in the legends of the appropriate figures, and doses were
calculated as the respective free bases. all procedures were conducted in accordance with national institutes of health guidelines
for the care and use of laboratory animals and the university of
utah institutional animal care and use committee.
[3h]da uptake via plasmalemmal transporters and
[3h]win35428 binding. uptake of [3h]da was determined in striatal synaptosomes prepared according to the method described by
kokoshka et al. (1998). briefly, fresh striatal tissue was homogenized in cold 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged (800g for 12 min; 4°c).
the supernatant (s1) was then centrifuged (22,000g for 15 min; 4°c),
and the resulting pellet (p2) was resuspended in ice-cold modified
krebs’ buffer (126 mm nacl, 4.8 mm kcl, 1.3 mm cacl2, 16 mm
sodium phosphate, 1.4 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 11 mm dextrose, 1 mm ascorbic
acid, ph 7.4). assays were conducted in krebs’ buffer. each assay
tube contained synaptosomal tissue (i.e., resuspended p2 obtained
from 1.5 mg of original wet weight striatal tissue) and 1 ␮m  xxxd2850xxx . nonspecific values were determined in the presence of 100 ␮m
cocaine. after preincubation of assay tubes for 10 min at 37°c, assays
were initiated by the addition of [3h]da (0.5 nm final concentration).
samples were incubated at 37°c for 3 min. samples were then
filtered through whatman gf/b filters (brandel inc., gaithersburg,
md) soaked previously in 0.05% polyethylenimine. filters were
washed rapidly three times with 3 ml of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose by
using a brandel filtering manifold. radioactivity trapped in filters
was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. remaining resuspended p2 samples were assayed for protein concentrations according to the method of lowry et al. (1951). in mdma in vitro experiments, samples were preincubated with 10 ␮m mdma for 30 min at
37°c. after 30 min, resuspended p2 fractions were “washed” by
centrifugation (22,000g for 15 min; 4°c). the resulting pellet (p3)
was then resuspeded in ice-cold krebs’ buffer and once again centrifuged (22,000g for 15 min; 4°c) to obtain a p4 pellet that was
subsequently resuspended and assayed. [3h]win35428 binding (0.5
nm final concentration) was conducted in phosphate-buffered 0.32 m
sucrose, ph 7.4, with synaptosomes obtained from 2 mg (original wet
weight) of striatal tissue per reaction tube, and samples were incubated on ice for 2 h. samples were then filtered through whatman
gf/b filters (brandel inc.) soaked previously in 0.05% polyethylenimine. filters were washed rapidly three times with 3 ml of ice-cold

from the reducing environment within synaptic vesicles to
extravesicular intracellular oxidizing environments, thus
causing the formation of oxygen radicals and reactive metabolites within da neurons that trigger selective da terminal
loss. accordingly, da-releasing agents that rapidly decrease
dat function (i.e., meth; fleckenstein et al., 1997; kokoshka et al., 1998) may interfere with dat function and
attenuate da efflux, thereby “trapping” da in intraneuronal
spaces where it can damage da nerve terminals. hence, an
understanding of the effect of psychostimulants on dat is
important.
in addition to dat,  xxxg2099xxx -2 is a significant regulator of
intraneuronal da concentrations. presumably, a decrease in
the function of the  xxxg2099xxx -2 impedes the sequestration of da
into synaptic vesicles, and may, therefore, increase cytoplasmic da concentrations. accordingly, a stimulant-induced decrease in vesicular uptake would presumably contribute to
effects leading to persistent da neuronal deficits. consistent
with this hypothesis, increased meth neurotoxicity in heterozygous  xxxg2099xxx -2 knockout mice has been reported (fumagalli et al., 1999). hence, like with dat, an understanding of
the effects of stimulants on  xxxg2099xxx -2 is important.
our laboratory has hypothesized that concurrent stimulant-induced decreases in plasmalemmal dat and  xxxg2099xxx -2
function may contribute to persistent neurotoxic da deficits
by promoting intraneuronal da accumulation and reactive
oxygen species generation (for review, see fleckenstein et al.,
2000). alterations in the ratio of dat to  xxxg2099xxx -2 function
have been implicated in other disease states as well, including the deficits associated with parkinson’s disease (for review, see miller et al., 1999). accordingly, differences in the
effects of meth and mdma on dat and  xxxg2099xxx -2 function
may contribute to their dissimilar long-term neurotoxic da
consequences. hence, the purpose of the present study was to
investigate the impact of mdma on dat and  xxxg2099xxx -2, and
compare these data with effects of meth as reported previously (kokoshka et al., 1998; brown et al., 2000, 2001;
metzger et al., 2000). because it has been demonstrated that
activation of protein kinase c (pkc) can alter the impact of
psychostimulants on dat function (kantor and gnegy, 1998;
sandoval et al., 2001), and that activation of da receptors
effects meth-induced alterations in plasmalemmal
(metzger et al., 2000) and vesicular (fleckenstein et al.;
2001) da uptake, the role of pkc and da receptors in effecting mdma-induced changes in either plasmalemmal or vesicular da uptake was assessed. results reveal that mdma
administration rapidly and reversibly decreases both plasmalemmal and vesicular da transport. mechanisms underlying these phenomena per se and in comparison with previously reported effects of meth are discussed.

results
results presented in fig. 1 confirm previous reports that
multiple high-dose administrations of mdma rapidly (within
1 h) decrease plasmalemmal da uptake function, as assessed
in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats compared with
synaptosomes prepared from saline vehicle-treated controls.
this deficit represents a decrease in vmax (2388 and 1410
fmol/mg of original wet weight tissue per 5 min for salineand mdma-treated rats, respectively), whereas transporter
km was virtually unaffected (99.6 versus 98.9 nm for salineand mdma-treated rats, respectively; metzger et al., 1998).
to determine the duration and nature of this phenomenon,
the time-response effects of mdma on plasmalemmal da
uptake and binding of the dat ligand win35428 were conducted. results reveal that the mdma-induced deficit in
plasmalemmal da uptake was reversed 24 h after drug treatment. in contrast, win35428 binding was only slightly reduced (i.e., by 10%) 1 h after treatment: this deficit persisted
24 h after drug treatment.
multiple administrations of mdma (4 ⫻ 10 mg/kg; 2-h
intervals; s.c.) to rats typically increases core body temperature by approximately 2– 4°c. previous studies have demonstrated that such hyperthermia contributes to the deficit in
plasmalemmal da uptake caused by multiple administrations of meth (metzger et al., 2000). hence, the role of body
temperature in the reduction in plasmalemmal da uptake
induced by multiple administrations of mdma was assessed
by preventing the mdma-induced increase in body temperature. upon administration of mdma, some rats were exposed to an ambient temperature of 6°c for the duration of
the experiment (to maintain normothermic body tempera-

tosomes prepared from rat striatum as described above. synaptosomes were resuspended and homogenized in cold distilled deionized
water. osmolarity was restored by addition of 245 mm hepes and
100 mm potassium tartrate (final concentrations; ph 7.5). samples
were centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000g (4°c) to remove lysed synaptosomal membranes.  xxxd2534xxx  (1 mm, final concentration) was added
to the supernatant, which was then centrifuged for 45 min at
100,000g (4°c). the resulting vesicular pellet was resuspended in
wash buffer at a concentration of 50 mg/ml (original tissue weight).
based on published reports with similar protocols for vesicle preparation (kadota and kadota, 1973; teng et al., 1997), we believe
vesicles isolated in these studies to be of the small synaptic vesicle
size (⬃50 nm), the predominant type found in dopaminergic terminals in the striatum (nirenberg et al., 1997). vesicular [3h]da uptake was performed by incubating 100 ␮l of synaptic vesicle samples
(⬃2.5 ␮g of protein) at 30°c for 3 min in assay buffer (final concentration: 25 mm hepes, 100 mm potassium tartrate, 1.7 mm  xxxd228xxx , 0.05 mm egta, 0.1 mm edta, 2 mm atp-mg2⫹, ph 7.5)
in the presence of [3h]da (30 nm final concentration). the reaction
was terminated by addition of 1 ml of cold wash buffer (assay buffer
containing 2 mm  xxxd2534xxx  substituted for the atp-mg2⫹, ph 7.5) and
rapid filtration through whatman gf/f filters soaked previously in
0.5% polyethylenimine. filters were washed three times with cold
wash buffer by using a brandel filtering manifold. radioactivity
trapped in filters was counted using a liquid scintillation counter.
nonspecific values were determined by measuring vesicular [3h]da
uptake at 4°c in wash buffer. binding of [3h]dhtbz was performed
as described by teng et al. (1998). briefly, 200 ␮l of the synaptic
vesicle preparation (⬃6 ␮g of protein) was incubated in wash buffer
in the presence of [3h]dhtbz (2 nm final concentration) for 10 min
at 25°c. the reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of cold wash
buffer and rapid filtration through whatman gf/f filters soaked in
0.5% polyethylenimine. filters were washed three times with icecold wash buffer. nonspecific binding was determined by coincubation with 20 ␮m  xxxd3330xxx . all protein concentrations were

and centrifuged for 15 min at 22,000g. tissue pellets were retained
and protein determined according to the method of lowry et al.
(1951). the supernatant was centrifuged a second time for 10 min at

figs. 1–3). pretreatment with the pkc inhibitor npc15437
attenuated the mdma-induced deficit caused by in vitro
incubation with mdma (fig. 4a). moreover, pretreatment
with another selective pkc inhibitor, ro31-7549, attenuated
the mdma-induced deficit in vitro as well (fig. 4b). incubation of synaptosomes with mdma had no effect on win35428
binding (data not shown).
to examine the effects of mdma treatment on vesicular
da uptake, a time-response study was conducted. results
presented in fig. 5 demonstrate that not only does mdma
treatment rapidly diminish plasmalemmal da uptake but
also striatal vesicular da uptake, compared with salinetreated controls. specifically, multiple mdma administrations rapidly decreased vesicular da uptake, as assessed in
vesicles purified from striata of treated animals. this deficit
partially recovered 24 h after drug treatment. in addition,
mdma treatment reduced binding of the  xxxg2099xxx -2 ligand
[3h]dhtbz, both 1 and 24 h after treatment.
because it has been demonstrated that meth-induced
hyperthermia contributes to the deficit in  xxxg2099xxx  function (haughey et al., 2000; metzger et al., 2000),
the role of body temperature in the reduction in vesicular da
uptake induced by multiple administrations of mdma was
assessed by preventing the mdma-induced increase in body
temperature. results presented in fig. 6, a and b, show that
similar to the mdma-induced effects on plasmalemmal da
transport, hyperthermia did not contribute to the drug-induced decrease in vesicular da uptake or [3h]dhtbz binding because its attenuation did not prevent these deficits.
corresponding rat core body temperatures for mdmatreated rats, along with those of saline-treated controls, are
shown in fig. 6c, and are comparable to those reported
previously after meth treatment (metzger et al., 2000).
in the next experiment, the role of da in the mdmainduced decrease in vesicular da uptake was assessed. because depletion of da resulting from ␣mt treatment in-

to room temperature (24°c) to allow hyperthermia to occur.
as shown in fig. 2a, attenuation of mdma-induced hyperthermia did not prevent the rapid decrease in [3h]da uptake
induced by multiple administrations of mdma, compared
with saline vehicle-treated controls. in this experiment,
win35428 binding was not affected by either mdma administration or by manipulating body temperatures (data not
shown). corresponding rat core body temperatures are
shown in fig. 2b.
in addition to demonstrating a role for hyperthermia, previous studies have shown that da contributes to the deficit in
dat function caused by multiple administrations of meth
(metzger et al., 2000). hence, the role of da in the reduction
of plasmalemmal da uptake induced by multiple administrations of mdma was assessed by depleting striatal da
levels by administering the  xxxg2276xxx  inhibitor
␣mt before mdma treatment. ␣mt (150 mg/kg i.p.) was
injected 5 and 1 h before, and 3 h after the first injection of
mdma. striatal da levels were greatly reduced by ␣mt
pretreatment (55.0 ⫾ 5.0 versus 10.1 ⫾ 2.0 pg/␮g protein for
saline- versus ␣mt-treated rats, respectively; p ⬍ 0.05). as
demonstrated in fig. 3a, pretreatment with ␣mt did not
affect the mdma-induced decrease in dat activity. in this
experiment, win35428 binding was decreased by 18% after
mdma treatment: ␣mt pretreatment did not prevent this
deficit (fig. 3b).
to elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby mdma decreases
dat function in vitro, striatal synaptosomes were incubated
with mdma (10 ␮m) for 30 min at 37°c. a similar incubation
paradigm demonstrated that this in vitro model appears to
model some effects of meth treatment on dat in vivo (sandoval et al., 2001). results presented in fig. 4 demonstrate
that mdma treatment also decreases da uptake in vitro
with a magnitude similar to that observed after multiple in
vivo administrations of mdma (i.e., 35–55%; compare with

discussion

(johnson et al., 1988; insel et al., 1989). assuming that the
 xxxg2099xxx -2 and dat are important to these differential phenomena (see introduction), differential effects of meth and
mdma on these transporters would be expected. hence, the
purpose of this study was to characterize the acute effects of
mdma on dat and  xxxg2099xxx -2, and compare these data with
previous reports of the effects of meth on these transporters.
the results of this study indeed reveal significant differences between the effects of multiple administrations of
meth and mdma (both administered at doses of 10 mg/kg
s.c., four injections at 2-h intervals) on plasmalemmal da
uptake. specifically, the magnitude of the decrease caused by
mdma treatment (35–55%) is less than that observed 1 h
after multiple meth administrations (⬇70 – 80%; kokoshka
et al., 1998; fleckenstein et al., 1999; metzger et al., 2000).
moreover, the decrease observed 1 h after mdma treatment
recovers completely after 24 h (fig. 1), whereas the decrease
caused by meth only recovers to ⬇60% of control values
(kokoshka et al., 1998). in addition, at least one component

it is well established that high-dose administration of the
amphetamine analog meth causes da deficits persisting
months and even years after drug treatment in rodents,
nonhuman primates, and perhaps humans (buening and

versus ⬇65% after meth treatment; brown et al., 2000).
moreover, the effect of mdma was substantially reversed
24 h after treatment, whereas the deficits in vesicular da
uptake caused by multiple injections with meth largely
persist 24 h later (brown et al., 2000). interestingly, da
contributes to the deficits in vesicular da uptake caused by
multiple mdma injections, as demonstrated by findings that
pretreatment with the d2 antagonist eticlopride attenuates
slightly the mdma-induced deficit. (the role of da in the
effect of multiple meth treatments has not been determined.) hyperthermia did not appear to contribute to the
mdma-induced deficit in vesicular da uptake because its
attenuation did not prevent this deficit, although it is noteworthy that in this experiment, hyperthermia was not prevented completely by placing the animal in a cool environ-

treatment is associated with a decrease in win35428 binding (kokoshka et al., 1998), whereas multiple mdma injections had little or no acute effect on the binding of the plasmalemmal dat ligand. finally, neither depletion of da nor
prevention of hyperthermia attenuated the acute effects of
mdma on plasmalemmal da uptake (figs. 2 and 3). this is
in contrast to meth in that both hyperthermia and da
contribute, in part, to the deficit in plasmalemmal da uptake
caused by multiple administrations of the stimulant
(metzger et al., 2000).
not only are there significant differences between the effects of meth and mdma on plasmalemmal da uptake but
also vesicular da uptake. for instance, mdma causes deficits that are lesser in magnitude than those observed after
meth treatment (25–30% as shown in figs. 5– 6 for mdma

mdma and dopamine transport

with npc15437, as well as another pkc inhibitor (ro-317549), prevents the deficits induced by mdma application as
well. one caveat in interpreting these studies is that it remains to be determined whether the in vitro effects of mdma
are the same as those observed after multiple administrations in vivo. still, these data indicate that similar mechanisms may underlie the effects of a single meth and multiple mdma treatments. because it has been suggested that
the deficit in plasmalemmal da uptake induced after amphetamine and/or meth treatment may be associated with
pkc activation and/or subsequent internalization of the
plasmalemmal dat (saunders et al., 2000; sandoval et al.,
2001), the present data suggest that the mdma-induced
effect on dat may involve these processes as well.
in conclusion, multiple administrations of mdma and
meth differentially alter plasmalemmal and vesicular da
uptake. specifically, multiple meth injections appear to
cause an “extra” component that is hyperthermia- and dadependent, and makes its effects greater in magnitude and
duration than the effects of multiple mdma administrations,
possibly resulting in meth-induced damage to da neurons.
mdma and meth differentially alter vesicular da uptake
as well. in particular, the mdma-induced decrease in vesicular da uptake does not persist as long as the deficits induced by meth treatment. in addition, these studies support the hypothesis that differential effects of stimulants on
 xxxg2099xxx -2 and dat may underlie the differential neurotoxic
properties of the stimulants. whether the deficit in dat
function contributes to the deficit in  xxxg2099xxx -2 function, or vice
versa, remains to be established. further study regarding
the contributions of these phenomena to the differentially
long-term consequences of administering these stimulants is
warranted.

ment and hence a contribution of temperature to this
phenomenon cannot be eliminated absolutely.
as described in the introduction, we (for review, see fleckenstein et al., 2000) and others (cubells et al., 1994; fumagalli et al., 1999; lavoie and hastings, 1999) have hypothesized that psychostimulants, such as meth, may cause da
terminal loss by redistributing da from the reducing environment within synaptic vesicles to extravesicular intracellular oxidizing environments, thus resulting in formation of
da-associated oxygen radicals and reactive metabolites
within neurons. accordingly, da-releasing agents that rapidly decrease dat function (i.e., meth; fleckenstein et al.,
1997; kokoshka et al., 1998) may interfere with dat function and attenuate da efflux (i.e., interfere with the ability of
meth to cause da release through the dat), thereby “trapping” da in intraneuronal spaces where it can damage nerve
terminals. in addition, stimulant-induced decreases in vesicular uptake would presumably increase cytoplasmic da concentrations and, thereby, contribute to persistent da neuronal deficits. accordingly, it was predictable that multiple
administrations of meth, a regimen that causes persistent
da deficits (haughey et al., 1999), causes deficits in plasmalemmal and vesicular da uptake that were greater in
magnitude and/or duration than those observed after multiple mdma administrations (i.e., a regimen similar to that
which does not cause persistent da deficits; johnson et al.,
1988). in addition, our laboratory has demonstrated that
there are several components to the acute decrease in plasmalemmal da uptake induced by multiple meth injections,
and that the da- and hyperthermia-dependent components
of this phenomenon are likely associated with the long-term
da deficits caused by the stimulant (metzger et al., 2000).
interestingly, multiple mdma injections did not effect such
components (i.e., the acute deficit in plasmalemmal da uptake caused by mdma treatment was independent of da and
hyperthermia). hence, these differences in the acute effects
of multiple meth and mdma injections on plasmalemmal
and vesicular da uptake may contribute to the dissimilar da
neurotoxic potential of these agents.
it is interesting to note that although there were several
differences between effects of multiple meth and mdma
administrations, the acute effects of a single meth injection
(15 mg/kg) largely resemble the acute effects of multiple
mdma treatments. specifically, both phenomena are 1) similar in magnitude (fleckenstein et al., 1999), 2) reversed 24 h
after treatment (fleckenstein et al., 1997; figs. 1 and 2), and
3) occur independently of da and of drug-induced hyperthermia (metzger et al., 2000; figs. 2 and 3). hence, it might be
predicted that like multiple mdma administrations, a single
meth injection would not cause long-term da deficits. accordingly, it has been demonstrated that a single 15 mg/kg
meth injection does not effect long-term decreases in tyrosine hydoxylase activity, an indicator of the integrity of da
neuronal function (kogan et al., 1976).
it has been demonstrated in an in vitro synaptosomal
model that pretreatment with the selective protein kinase c
inhibitor npc15437 (10 ␮m, a concentration 30-fold less
than the ic50 for inhibition of both  xxxg1836xxx  and
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; sullivan et
al., 1992) attenuates the decrease in plasmalemmal da uptake caused by meth administration (sandoval et al., 2001).
