abstract
pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate, the active form of  xxxd3049xxx , is an
essential cofactor for multiple enzymes, including aromatic
l-amino acid decarboxylase that catalyses the final stage in
the production of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. in two patients with inherited disorders of  xxxd3049xxx 
metabolism, we observed reductions in plasma aromatic
l-amino acid decarboxylase activity. in one patient, this
change was related to an increase in km for pyridoxal 5¢phosphate. furthermore, pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate-deficient
human sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells were found to exhibit
reduced levels of  xxxg618xxx 
activity and protein but with no alteration in expression.
further reductions in activity and protein were observed with
the addition of the  xxxd3049xxx  antagonist 4-deoxypyridoxine,

which also reduced  xxxg618xxx 
mrna levels. neither pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate deficiency nor
the addition of 4-deoxypyridoxine affected aromatic l-amino
acid decarboxylase stability over 8 h with protein synthesis
inhibited. increasing extracellular availability of pyridoxal 5¢phosphate was not found to have any significant effect on
intracellular pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate concentrations or on
 xxxg618xxx . these findings suggest that maintaining adequate pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate
availability may be important for optimal treatment of  xxxg618xxx  deficiency and l-doparesponsive conditions.

pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate (plp) is the required co-factor for the
catalytic activity of approximately one hundred enzymes in
the human body, including enzymes involved in the production and degradation of the neurotransmitters glutamate,
gaba, glycine,  xxxd5xxx , dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. consequently, optimal functioning of the nervous
system is reliant on an adequate supply of plp to ensure
neurotransmitter metabolism proceeds. a poignant reminder
of this dependence is the group of inherited disorders that
affect the availability of plp, which present with neonatal

seizures often from the ﬁrst day of life (reviewed by clayton
2006).
there are six forms of  xxxd3049xxx  of which plp is the
active form. plp is produced from pyridoxine or pyridoxamine by sequential phosphorylation and oxidation steps
catalysed by  xxxg1720xxx  (e.c. 2.7.1.35) and pyridox(am)ine 5¢-phosphate oxidase (e.c. 1.4.3.5;  xxxg1793xxx ).
alternatively, pyridoxal can be phosphorylated by pyridoxal
kinase to produce plp. plp is involved in the catalysis of an
array of enzymatic reactions, the vast majority of which
involve amino acids as substrates (reviewed by john 1995).
in addition to its well-established role as a cofactor plp has
been demonstrated to inﬂuence gene expression and prevent
degradation of some proteins (greengard and gordon 1963;
allgood et al. 1993; gross-mesilaty et al. 1997; huq et al.
2007).
 xxxg618xxx  ( xxxg618xxx ; dopa
decarboxylase; e.c. 4.1.1.28) is a plp-dependent enzyme
that catalyses the production of dopamine and serotonin from
l-3,  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa) and l-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-htp), respectively. it has been reported that
 xxxg618xxx  activity is sensitive to  xxxd3049xxx  deﬁciency in rat
(rahman et al. 1982; siow and dakshinamurti 1985;
guilarte et al. 1987). in each study,  xxxg618xxx  activity was
reduced in several tissue extracts even after plp was added
into the reaction mixture, demonstrating that some  xxxg618xxx 
activity was lost in a manner not related to cofactor
availability during the reaction. furthermore, in rat pheochromocytoma cells cultured in  xxxd3049xxx -deﬁcient medium
and in the presence of a  xxxd3049xxx  antagonist a loss of
 xxxg618xxx  activity and  xxxg618xxx  protein was observed (matsuda
et al. 2004). these ﬁndings suggest that plp may have an
additional role in maintaining  xxxg618xxx  availability and
consequently in the control of monoamine metabolism.
pyridoxine or plp are currently used as a treatment for
conditions of  xxxd3049xxx  deﬁciency (mills et al. 2005, 2006)
and inherited conditions affecting plp-dependent enzymes
such as  xxxg618xxx  deﬁciency (hyland and clayton 1990). there
is also some evidence that  xxxd3049xxx  could be a beneﬁcial
treatment for a number of movement disorders related to
monoamine deﬁcits including drug-induced parkinsonism
and tardive dyskinesia, and some parkinson’s disease
patients treated with l-dopa and a peripheral decarboxylase
inhibitor (sandyk and pardeshi 1990; tan et al. 2005; lerner
et al. 2007). the beneﬁts of  xxxd3049xxx  treatment in these
conditions may be related to improvements in monoamine
metabolism, which in turn may be due to increased  xxxg618xxx 
activity.
in view of the potential inﬂuence of plp on  xxxg618xxx  levels
and the possible associated treatment implications, we
investigated  xxxg618xxx  activity in patients with the inherited
disorder  xxxg1793xxx  deﬁciency and the effects of plp availability
on  xxxg618xxx  activity, protein and expression in human
neuroblastoma cells in culture.

(dmem/f-12), pyridoxine deﬁcient dmem/f-12, foetal bovine
serum (fbs), 2.5 g/l trypsin and all nupage sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents and gels were
purchased from invitrogen (paisley, uk). sterile hank’s balanced
salt solution (hbss), 4-deoxypyridoxine, pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate,
cycloheximide and mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail were
bought from sigma (poole, uk). all other chemicals unless
otherwise stated were from sigma, vwr international (lutterworth,
uk) or fisher scientiﬁc (loughborough, uk).
patient samples
all patient plasma samples including controls were tested as part of
diagnostic investigations requested by the patient’s clinician and
after informed consent. anonymised control samples were from
patients later found not to have conditions relating to  xxxd3049xxx  or
monoamine metabolism. part of the patient data has been published
previously in abstract form (allen et al. 2008).
neuroblastoma cell culture
sh-sy5y cells were purchased from the european collection of cell
cultures (health protection agency, salisbury, uk). for routine
culture, cells were seeded in ﬂasks at a density of 1 · 104 cells/cm2 in
dmem/f-12 growth medium supplemented with 100 ml/l fbs.
cells were incubated at 37c in 5% co2. cell medium was replaced
the day after seeding and every other day thereafter. cells were
passaged using 2.5 g/l trypsin at 80–90% conﬂuence. for experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 5 · 104 cells/cm2. control
cells were grown in dmem/f-12 growth medium, which contains
9.71 lmol/l pyridoxine. for test conditions, cells were cultured in
pyridoxine-deﬁcient dmem/f-12 growth medium ()b6); pyridoxine
deﬁcient dmem/f-12 + 5 mmol/l 4-deoxypyridoxine ()b6 4-dp);

10 lmol/l plp (plp). all test compounds were dissolved in distilled
h2o and 0.2 lm sterile ﬁltered. an equivalent volume of distilled
h2o was added to all conditions not receiving a test compound. for
 xxxg618xxx  stability experiments, cells were treated with the indicated
conditions for 72 h. one hundred microgram per millilitre cycloheximide was subsequently added to each condition and the cells were
incubated for 0, 4 and 8 h before harvesting as below.
cell harvesting for enzyme and plp measurement
cells were incubated for 72 h unless otherwise stated before being
harvested with 2.5 g/l trypsin. trypsin was inhibited with fbs,
removed by centrifugation and pellets were washed once with hbss
before being resuspended in 10 mmol/l tris (ph 7.4), 1 mmol/l
edta, 320 mmol/l sucrose buffer containing protease inhibitor
cocktail. samples were stored at )80c until analysis. immediately
prior to analysis samples were thawed at +37c and subsequently

uk); coulochem iii electrochemical detector and 5010 analytical
cell (esa analytical, aylesbury, uk). data were captured using
azur version 4.6 software (datalys, saint martin d’heres, france).
the mobile phase consisted of 50 mmol/l sodium phosphate ph
3.60, 5 mmol/l octanesulfonic acid, 25 mg/l edta, 2.8 ml/l
orthophosphoric acid, 230 ml/l methanol in hplc grade water.
the ﬂow rate was 1.2 ml/min and column temperature was
maintained at +25c or +35c for dopamine or serotonin
measurement respectively. fifty microlitres of each sample was
injected and separated on a 250 · 4.6 mm i.d. hiqsil c18w
column (kya tech. corp., tokyo, japan). dopamine and serotonin
were detected by electrochemical detection with a working electrode
potential of +350 mv. samples were quantiﬁed using an external
standard of 1000 nmol/l dopamine or serotonin.
pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate
plp was measured by hplc with ﬂuorescence detection using a
commercial kit (chromsystems, munich, germany) as previously
described (ormazabal et al. 2008).

l-dopa

decarboxylation
decarboxylation was measured using the method of hyland
and clayton (1992) with minor modiﬁcations. brieﬂy, 50 ll plasma
or cell lysate were incubated with 70 lmol/l plp in assay buffer
(500 mmol/l sodium phosphate ph 7.0, 0.167 mmol/l edta,
39 mmol/l dithioerythrietol) for 120 min at +37c. twenty-ﬁve
microlitre 20 mmol/l l-dopa (ﬁnal conc. 2 mmol/l), except where
stated, was added to the reaction mixture and after mixing was
incubated for a further 90 (plasma samples) or 5 min (cell lysate) at
+37c. the reaction was stopped with 250 ll 0.8 mol/l perchloric
acid (ﬁnal volume 500 ll). samples were incubated at +20c for
10 min before centrifugation at 12 000 g for 5 min at +4c.
samples were stored at )80c before measurement of dopamine by
hplc as described above.
l-dopa

5-htp decarboxylation
5-htp decarboxylation was measured in the same manner as
l-dopa decarboxylation with the exception that the assay buffer
used consisted of 167 mmol/l sodium phosphate ph 8.0,
0.167 mmol/l edta, 39 mmol/l dithioerythrietol and in place
of l-dopa 25 ll 5 mmol/l 5-htp (ﬁnal conc. 0.5 mmol/l),
except where stated, was added at the same time point. samples
were stored at )80c before analysis of serotonin by hplc as
described above.
western blotting
sh-sy5y cells were washed with hbss, collected in ice cold
10 mmol/l tris ph 8.0, 150 mmol/l nacl, 20 g/l 3-[(3cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (chaps)
buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail, frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at )80c. samples were thawed and agitated
for 1 h at +4c and then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min at
+4c. ten microgram protein/sample was separated on a 4–12%
bis–tris gel (invitrogen). protein was transferred to immobilon-p
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (millipore, billerica, ma,

usa) by electrotransfer, in 25 mmol/l tris ph 8.3, 192 mmol/l
glycine, 200 ml/l methanol transfer buffer at +80 v for 70 min.
following blocking for 1 h in 30 g/l, non-fat dry milk in
phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 ml/l tween-20 (pbst), membranes
were probed with primary goat polyclonal to human  xxxg618xxx 
(abcam, cambridge, uk; 1 : 5000) or b-actin mouse monoclonal
(sigma; 1 : 10 000) for 16 h at +4c, washed 3 · 20 min in
pbst, then re-blocked for 20 min in blocking buffer. membranes
were then incubated with secondary antibody either horseradish
peroxidise (hrp) conjugated polyclonal to goat igg (abcam;
1 : 2000) for  xxxg618xxx  or hrp-conjugated anti-mouse igg (sigma;
1 : 2000) for b-actin and subsequently washed 3 · 20 min in
pbst. the membranes were incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence hrp substrate (thermo scientiﬁc, rockford, il, usa)
according to manufacturer’s instructions and visualised by exposure to x-ray ﬁlm. quantiﬁcation was performed using the biorad (hemel hempstead, uk) molecular imager and quantity one
software.
quantitative real-time pcr
sh-sy5y cells were incubated for the indicated length of time
before being harvested with 2.5 g/l trypsin. trypsin was inhibited
with fbs, removed by centrifugation and pellets were washed once
with hbss and stored at )80c. cell pellets were homogenised
using qiashredder spin columns (qiagen, crawley, uk) and total
rna was extracted with the rneasy minikit (qiagen) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. total rna was reverse transcribed to
cdna using oligo d(t)18 and superscript ii reverse transcriptase
(invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. quantitative
pcr was carried out using the rotor-gene 6000 system (qiagen)
and iqsybr green supermix (bio-rad). the primers used were as
follows  xxxg618xxx , 5¢-ttc ctt tct tta tgg ttg cc-3¢, 3¢-tgt

tg-3¢. the pcr conditions were denaturation at 95c for 3 min,
followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94c for 20 s, annealing at
55c for 30 s and elongation 72c for 30 s. for quantiﬁcation of
 xxxg618xxx  and  xxxg861xxx  mrna expression, a standard curve of
 xxxg861xxx  was generated from external standards as previously
described (fitzgerald et al. 2007).  xxxg618xxx  mrna expression is
given as arbitrary units/molecule of  xxxg861xxx  dna.
total protein
total protein was measured using the modiﬁed lowry assay (dc
protein assay) according to manufacturer’s instructions (bio-rad).
statistical analysis
statistical signiﬁcance was determined using anova followed by the
least signiﬁcant difference test. in all cases, p < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant. all data are expressed as mean ± sem.

at 37c for 120 min prior to the addition of substrate.
consequently, it is unlikely that  xxxg618xxx  activity with either
l-dopa or 5-htp as substrate is dependent on the concentration
of plp coenzyme present during the assay. plasma  xxxg618xxx  ldopa decarboxylation was determined in two patients with
 xxxg1793xxx  deﬁciency (ages: 2 and 6 weeks), a condition that
results in very low levels of plp. in both cases, l-dopa
decarboxylation was below the paediatric reference range (36–
129 pmol/min/ml) and reduced in comparison to controls of a
similar age (see fig. 1). in one patient, the enzyme kinetics of
 xxxg618xxx  for plp was additionally determined by measuring ldopa decarboxylation in plasma at different concentrations of
plp (0.5–70 lmol/l). this patient was found to have a
coenzyme km apparent of 15.0 lmol/l compared with a
control value of 3.6 lmol/l.
 xxxd3049xxx  treatment in cell culture
to further investigate the effect of plp availability on
 xxxg618xxx , human neuroblastoma cells were treated with three
conditions. cells were cultured in pyridoxine deﬁcient ()b6)
medium, pyridoxine deﬁcient medium containing 5 mmol/l
4-deoxypyridoxine ()b6 4-dp) a  xxxd3049xxx  antagonist or in
medium containing 10 lmol/l plp. 4-deoxypyridoxine was
not found to directly inhibit  xxxg618xxx  when added in vitro to
the assay (data not shown). at 72 h in culture, both )b6 and
)b6 4-dp treatment led to signiﬁcant reductions in intracellular plp concentrations to 66% and 67% of control
respectively (p < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively; see fig. 2a).
plp treatment did not increase intracellular plp concentrations at 72 h. treatment with 100 lmol/l plp or pyridoxal
also did not lead to increases in intracellular plp at the 72 h
time point (data not shown).

plp deficiency reduces  xxxg618xxx  activity
 xxxg618xxx  activity with either l-dopa or 5-htp as substrate was
measured in cells exposed to the different  xxxd3049xxx 
conditions for 72 h.  xxxg618xxx  l-dopa decarboxylation in
cells cultured in )b6 medium was signiﬁcantly reduced
to approximately 70% of control activity (p < 0.05; see
fig. 2b). )b6 4-dp treatment led to further decreases in
l-dopa decarboxylation to approximately 30% of control
(p < 0.001). l-dopa decarboxylation was similarly decreased
when the cells were treated with 5 mmol/l 4-deoxypyridox-

ine alone. l-dopa decarboxylation was not signiﬁcantly
different between )b6 4-dp and 4-deoxypyridoxine alone
treatments (p = 0.526; see fig. 2b), consequently only the
)b6 4-dp condition was investigated for further experiments. a comparable pattern was found for  xxxg618xxx  activity
with 5-htp as substrate. )b6 treatment reduced  xxxg618xxx  5htp decarboxylation to approximately 70% of control
(p < 0.001) and activity was further reduced to approximately 30% of control with )b6 4-dp treatment (p < 0.001;
see fig. 2c). in plp-treated cells, there was no statistically
signiﬁcant change in  xxxg618xxx  activity with either l-dopa or
5-htp as substrate compared with control (p = 0.283, 0.482
respectively). it is interesting to note that the loss of both
 xxxg618xxx  activities in the )b6 treated cells is comparable with
the degree of loss of intracellular plp.
substrate kinetics
the  xxxg618xxx  coenzyme km for plp could not be determined
because of the high proportion of  xxxg618xxx  already bound to
plp in cell culture. consequently, we could not conﬁrm the
altered coenzyme km found in the  xxxg1793xxx -deﬁcient patient.
however, to characterise the alterations in  xxxg618xxx  activities
in cells exposed to the different conditions of  xxxd3049xxx 
availability we determined the substrate kinetics of  xxxg618xxx .
measurement of substrate kinetics was made by varying the
concentration of l-dopa (25–2000 lmol/l) or 5-htp (5–
500 lmol/l) present during the reaction. both l-dopa and 5htp decarboxylation reactions appeared to follow classical
michaelis–menten kinetics (see fig. 3). in samples from all
four conditions  xxxg618xxx  decarboxylation was saturated by
1000 lmol/l of l-dopa. however, the rate of reaction
achieved by the point of saturation was reduced compared
with control in )b6-treated cells and further reduced in )b6
4-dp-treated cells (see fig. 3a). the same was found with
5-htp as substrate where the reaction for each  xxxd3049xxx 
condition was saturated by 250 lmol/l of 5-htp. again the
reaction rate at saturation was lower following )b6 treatment
and lower still following )b6 4-dp treatment (see fig. 3b).
small increases in the reaction rate at saturation were found
in plp-treated cells for both 5-htp and l-dopa decarboxylation. the vmax and substrate km were determined by
lineweaver–burke plots (see fig. 3c and d). the substrate
km apparent with either l-dopa or 5-htp was not signiﬁcantly different between any of the  xxxd3049xxx  conditions or
control (see table 1). note that this is the substrate km that
was unchanged not the coenzyme km, which was altered in
one  xxxg1793xxx -deﬁcient patient. however, the vmax for 5-htp
was reduced compared with control by approximately 74%
(p < 0.001) and 36% (p < 0.05) in the )b6 4-dp- and )b6treated cells respectively. with l-dopa as substrate vmax was
reduced by approximately 75% (p < 0.001) and 30%
(p < 0.05) in )b6 4-dp- and )b6-treated cells. the
plp treated cells showed no statistically signiﬁcant change
in vmax.

 xxxg618xxx  protein, stability and expression
immunoblotting using a speciﬁc antibody raised against
amino acids 464–475 of human  xxxg618xxx  detected two bands at
approximately 50 kda (see fig. 4). these two bands are
most likely two isoforms of  xxxg618xxx  termed aadc480 and
aadc442 that have predicted molecular masses of 54 and
50 kda respectively (o’malley et al. 1995; chang et al.
1996).  xxxg618xxx  protein was reduced in both plp deﬁciency
states. using quantiﬁcation software (bio-rad), the )b6 4dp-treated cells had the lowest level of  xxxg618xxx  protein,
70 ± 5% of control (n = 3).  xxxg618xxx  protein was reduced to a
lesser extent in )b6 treated cells at 78 ± 13% of control
(n = 4), while control- and plp-treated cells had approximately equivalent levels of  xxxg618xxx  protein.
to establish whether changes in  xxxg618xxx  protein and
activity were related to changes in expression  xxxg618xxx  mrna
levels were measured under the four treatment conditions by
quantitative pcr. there were no statistically signiﬁcant
changes in  xxxg618xxx  mrna expression between the treatment
groups after 24 h. however, after 72 h of treatment  xxxg618xxx 
mrna expression was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with
control in the )b6 4-dp-treated cells (p < 0.01; see fig. 5a).
no statistically signiﬁcant changes were seen in the )b6- or
plp-treated cells at 72 h in comparison with control.
to investigate whether the )b6 and )b6 4-dp treatment
conditions affect the stability of  xxxg618xxx , we monitored the
change in  xxxg618xxx  activity towards l-dopa after inhibition of
protein synthesis with 100 lg/ml cycloheximide. this
protocol has been used previously in sh-sy5y cells to
investigate the stability of other proteins (moore et al. 2003).
consistent with observations described above after 72 h of
)b6 and )b6 4-dp treatment l-dopa decarboxylation was
reduced in )b6-treated cells and further reduced in )b6
4-dp-treated cells (see fig. 5b). after subsequent treatment
with cycloheximide for 4 and 8 h, no change in  xxxg618xxx 
l-dopa decarboxylation was observed in control, )b6 or )b6
4-dp treatment, indicating that stability of  xxxg618xxx  is not
affected by these treatments over the tested time period.

discussion
we have demonstrated that the activity of  xxxg618xxx  was
decreased in two patients with  xxxg1793xxx  deﬁciency and in
cultured neuroblastoma cells with reduced levels of plp. plp
is known to participate in mechanistic actions beyond its
coenzyme function. for example, it has been shown that plp
can act to prevent the degradation of some plp-dependent
enzymes. the activity and half-life of the plp-dependent
enzyme  xxxg2250xxx  (e.c. no. 2.6.1.5; tat)
from rat liver has been shown to increase in a dose-dependent
and protein synthesis dependent manner in response to
 xxxd3049xxx  treatment (greengard and gordon 1963; snape
et al. 1980). plp was also found to protect tat from
degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome in vitro (gross-

mesilaty et al. 1997). overall, these ﬁndings indicate that
plp may act to prevent the degradation of newly synthesised
tat via the proteasome. we have demonstrated that  xxxg618xxx 
stability was unaffected for up to 8 h in response to plp
deﬁciency. consequently, a similar mechanism to that
observed for tat is unlikely to account for the observed
changes in  xxxg618xxx .
a loss of  xxxg618xxx  activity and protein in response to
4-deoxypyridoxine coupled with  xxxd3049xxx -deﬁcient medium has been reported before in rat pc12 cells (matsuda
et al. 2004). the authors suggested that this loss was related
to an increase in  xxxg618xxx  degradation. however, we have

found that 4-deoxypyridoxine-treated plp-deﬁcient cells
have reduced levels of  xxxg618xxx  expression, indicating that
down-regulation rather than increased degradation may, at

least in part, be responsible for the effect of this treatment.
furthermore, we have demonstrated that )b6 4-dp treatment
did not alter the stability of  xxxg618xxx  over 8 h demonstrating
that increased degradation may not be involved in this
response. we also found that 4-deoxypyridoxine did not alter
intracellular plp concentrations indicating that it may have a
direct effect on  xxxg618xxx  or  xxxg618xxx  expression. 4-deoxypyridoxine is a substrate for  xxxg1720xxx  where it is
phosphorylated to 4-deoxypyridoxine 5¢-phosphate (hurwitz
1955). this phosphorylated form of 4-deoxypyridoxine can
act as a non-competitive inhibitor of some plp-dependent
enzymes by competing with plp binding in the active site
(meister et al. 1953; hurwitz 1955; amer et al. 1967). the
reduction in vmax but unaltered km seen in our )b6 4-dptreated cells would be consistent with kinetic changes
resulting from a non-competitive inhibitor. however, a
reduced vmax and unaltered km would also be consistent
with a decrease in active enzyme which is also suggested by
the observed reduction of  xxxg618xxx  protein and expression,
consequently inhibition alone is unlikely to account for the
loss in  xxxg618xxx  activity. plp has previously been
demonstrated to interact with transcription factors (allgood
et al. 1993; huq et al. 2007), it could be that 4-deoxypyridoxine or its phosphorylated form inhibits an interaction of
plp with a transcription factor and that this interaction led to
the observed decrease in  xxxg618xxx  expression. that a plp
antagonist can reduce  xxxg618xxx  expression is a possible
indication that plp may be involved in the control of
 xxxg618xxx  expression. however, a non-speciﬁc action of 4deoxypyridoxine, unrelated to plp antagonism, cannot be
ruled out.
a signiﬁcant effect of plp on expression was not
observed in our plp-deﬁcient cells although this may have
been because intracellular plp concentrations were only
reduced by one-third. however, despite no signiﬁcant
alteration in  xxxg618xxx  expression or stability, both  xxxg618xxx 
activity and protein were decreased in the plp-deﬁcient
cells. consequently, this suggests an alternative mechanism.
in one patient with plp deﬁciency, we found that the
coenzyme km apparent of  xxxg618xxx  for plp was increased,
indicating a reduction in the efﬁciency of the interaction
between  xxxg618xxx  and plp. this result could indicate that
plp may be involved in  xxxg618xxx  folding or dimerisation and
consequently plp deﬁciency may lead to an abundance of
less mature forms of  xxxg618xxx  protein with an altered
coenzyme km for plp. alternatively,  xxxg1793xxx -deﬁcient
patients are likely to have increased levels of the plp
precursors, pyridoxine 5¢-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5¢phosphate which at high concentrations could possibly
compete with plp for  xxxg618xxx  binding, which could also
explain the altered km for plp. alternative mechanisms for
the loss of  xxxg618xxx  in plp deﬁciency could include an
alteration in splicing control or possibly a disruption of
interactions of  xxxg618xxx  with other proteins.

in this study, in response to )b6 or )b6 4-dp treatment,
the proportion of  xxxg618xxx  activity lost with respect to each
substrate, l-dopa or 5-htp, was almost equal. however,
previous studies in  xxxd3049xxx -deﬁcient rats have found in
some tissues that there was not an equivalent loss of l-dopa
decarboxylase and 5-htp decarboxylase activities (rahman
et al. 1982; siow and dakshinamurti 1985). differences in
l-dopa and 5-htp decarboxylation by  xxxg618xxx  between
different tissues could be explained by post-translational
modiﬁcation. for example,  xxxg618xxx  is known to be phosphorylated in a manner that increases its l- xxxg618xxx  activity (duchemin et al. 2000). potentially
phosphorylation could lead to alterations in the structure of
 xxxg618xxx  causing one substrate to be favoured over another.
however, despite possible differences in  xxxg618xxx  substrate
preference between individual tissues the expected overall
effect of any loss of  xxxg618xxx  would be a relatively equivalent
decrease in both dopamine and serotonin metabolism.
one particularly notable feature of the plp-deﬁcient cells
in this study is that  xxxg618xxx  activity and protein were lost even
though plp concentrations were still two-thirds the level of
control. furthermore, almost the same proportions of  xxxg618xxx 
activity and plp were lost indicating that  xxxg618xxx  may be
sensitive to plp deﬁciency. there are several disorders and
drug treatments that could be negatively affected by a loss of
 xxxg618xxx  resulting from plp deﬁciency. patients with the
inherited disorder  xxxg618xxx  deﬁciency suffer from severely
reduced  xxxg618xxx  activity which results in a deﬁciency of
dopamine and serotonin (hyland and clayton 1990). these
patients are thought to retain some very low level of  xxxg618xxx 
activity. if these patients were allowed to become even
mildly plp deﬁcient, then our data support that the already
low levels of  xxxg618xxx  may be further reduced possibly leading
to a consequent worsening of clinical symptoms. the
majority of  xxxg618xxx -deﬁcient patients are currently treated
with pyridoxine or plp, although in most cases this treatment
is not reported to improve clinical condition (pons et al.
2004). however, rather than acting to boost  xxxg618xxx  activity
 xxxd3049xxx  supplementation may act as more of a preventative treatment against reductions in  xxxg618xxx  that would
result from low levels of plp (see allen et al. 2009). in
 xxxg618xxx  deﬁciency, l-dopa concentrations are increased as a
result of the metabolic block at  xxxg618xxx . increased l-dopa
concentrations could potentially lead to plp deﬁciency
because of a known reaction of l-dopa and plp producing
the l-dopa-plp pictet-spengler adduct (evered 1971).
consequently, determining plp status could be important
for the diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of patients with
 xxxg618xxx  deﬁciency to ensure that they do not become deﬁcient
in plp. this could be analogous to the need to monitor
5-methyltetrahydrofolate status in  xxxg618xxx  deﬁciency,
where methylation of the high levels of l-dopa during its
catabolism can deplete 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (brautigam
et al. 2000).

l-dopa treatment, used in parkinson’s disease and also in a
range of inherited conditions such as  xxxg2276xxx 
deﬁciency and disorders of tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism,
is reliant on  xxxg618xxx  within the cns to convert l-dopa into
dopamine (hyland 2007; pearl et al. 2007; schapira et al.
2009). therefore, the efﬁcacy of l-dopa treatment may also
be reliant on an adequate availability of central plp. if plp
availability was decreased in these patients this may lead to
a resultant decrease in  xxxg618xxx  and consequently there would
be less conversion of administered l-dopa into dopamine.
patients treated with l-dopa may also have an increased risk
of plp deﬁciency because of the potential reaction of l-dopa
with plp forming the l-dopa-plp adduct (evered 1971).
assessing patient plp levels may be an important consideration when attempting to optimise l-dopa treatment.
pyridoxine treatment has been demonstrated to reverse the
clinical effect of l-dopa; however, when l-dopa was given in
combination with a peripheral  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor, such as
carbidopa or benserazide, pyridoxine did not have this effect
(duvoisin et al. 1969; klawans et al. 1971). moreover,
pyridoxine has been suggested to be beneﬁcial for some
parkinson’s disease patients and a recent study has linked a
single nucleotide polymorphism in the  xxxg1720xxx  gene
with parkinson’s disease (tan et al. 2005; elstner et al.
2009).
drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia are
common side-effects of treatment with neuroleptic medication (reviewed by haddad and dursun 2008). a number of
reports and one small scale clinical trial have reported
that these side effects can be improved by administering
pyridoxine (deveaugh-geiss and manion 1978; sandyk and
pardeshi 1990; lerner et al. 1999, 2007). in one case report,
it was suggested that  xxxd3049xxx  treatment may enhance
 xxxg618xxx  activity, leading to improvements in dopamine
and serotonin metabolism (sandyk and pardeshi 1990).
in our investigations, increasing the extracellular levels of
plp did not lead to any signiﬁcant changes in intracellular
plp concentrations or  xxxg618xxx  activity in cell culture.
however, there was a general trend of small increases in
 xxxg618xxx  activity towards both l-dopa and 5-htp. further
investigations are required to determine if increased plp
availability can increase  xxxg618xxx  activity. plp deﬁciency may
be a risk factor for drug-induced movement disorders and
patients responsive to  xxxd3049xxx  may have an underlying
plp deﬁciency (sandyk and pardeshi 1990; miodownik
et al. 2008). in this circumstance, it is possible that  xxxg618xxx 
levels would also be reduced and therefore increasing
intracellular plp availability may increase  xxxg618xxx  levels,
and this could be involved in the improvement of sideeffects. again determining patient plp status could potentially be informative as to whether these patients may
respond to plp therapy.
we have described the effects of plp deﬁciency on  xxxg618xxx 
in patients with  xxxg1793xxx  deﬁciency and in cell culture. plp

deﬁciency occurs in a range of other inherited conditions
and is a relatively common side-effect to some drug
treatments (see clayton 2006). it is possible that in these
conditions plp deﬁciency could also lead to a loss of  xxxg618xxx 
and potentially a reduction in dopamine and serotonin
metabolism. similar effects have been observed previously
in rodents for several other plp-dependent enzymes (meister
et al. 1953; greengard and gordon 1963; snape et al. 1980).
it seems probable that plp could play a dual role for many
enzymes, acting as a co-enzyme and additionally inﬂuencing
enzyme availability. consequently, for conditions of plp
deﬁciency such as  xxxg1793xxx  deﬁciency there may be the
combined effect of not only a loss of plp co-enzyme but also
a loss of the enzymes that are dependent on plp.
