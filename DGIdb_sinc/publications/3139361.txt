abstract

the relative binding affinities (rbas) of four progestational
compounds
( xxxd2751xxx ,
levonorgestrel,
 xxxd2067xxx 
and gestodene) for the
human progesterone
and androgen receptors were measured in mcf-7 cytosol
and intact mcf-7 cells. for the binding to the progesterone
receptor, both
org 2058 and  xxxd2067xxx  (or  xxxd2067xxx )
were used as labelled
ligands.
the following ranking (low to high) for the rba of the nuclear (intact
cells) progesterone
receptor irrespective of the ligand used is found:
 xxxd2751xxx 
<< levonorgestrel
< 3-keto-destogestrel
cgestodene. the
difference between the various progestagens
is significant with the
exception of that between  xxxd2067xxx 
and gestodene, when org 2058
is used as ligand. for the cytosolic progesterone
receptor, the same order
is found with the exception that similar rbas are found for gestodene and
 xxxd2067xxx .
the four progestagens clearly differ with respect to binding to the
 xxxg183xxx  using dihydrotestosterone
as labelled ligand in intact
cells; the ranking (low to high) is:  xxxd2751xxx 
< 3 keto- xxxd1849xxx 
< levonorgestrel
and gestodene. the difference between  xxxd2067xxx 
and levonorgestrel
or gestodene is significant. the selectivity indices
(ratio of the mean rba for the progesterone
receptor to that of androgen
receptor) in intact cells are significantly
higher for  xxxd2067xxx 
and gestodene than for levonorgestrel
and  xxxd2751xxx .
from these results we conclude that the introduction of the 18-methyl in
 xxxd2751xxx 
(levonorgestel)
increases both the binding to the
group as found in
progesterone and androgen receptors. the ll-methylene
 xxxd2067xxx 
increases the binding to the progesterone
receptor
compared to that of levonorgestrel
whereas the binding to the androgen
receptor is reduced. the introduction of a al5 into levonorgestrel
(gestodene) increases only the binding to the progesterone
receptor.

introduction

today the 19-nortestosterone
derivatives form the progestational
constituent of combined oral contraceptives
(ocs). norethynodrel,
 xxxd2751xxx 
acetate,  xxxd2751xxx 
and lynestrenol were the first
generation of this series of compounds. in search for more potent
progestagens,
several modifications
have been applied. the attachment of a
methyl group to the c
methyl group of  xxxd2751xxx 
forming an ethyl
group at carbon-13 leadto the more potent progestagen levonorgestrel.
however this alteration in the steroid skeleton also increased the
androgenic properties as is visualised by a decrease in high density
lipoprotein
(hdl) cholesterol
(1,2) and  xxxg2066xxx 
(shbg) (31, when levonorgestrel
is used as progestagen in monophasic oral
contraceptives.
especially the adverse effects on lipid metabolism gave
momentum to new developments.
firstly, the dose of the progestagen was
reduced as in a triphasic preparation containing levonorgestrel
and,
secondly, more selective progestagens were developed. a few years ago
 xxxd1849xxx  was introduced as a new progestagen. this compound has, in
addition to the is-methyl group, a methylene group at carbon atom 11. with
this modification
the compound becomes less androgenic than levonorgestrel
as found in in vitro (4) and in vivo studies (3). recently, gestodene was
presented as a new progestagen;
it possesses a double bond between carbon
atom 15 and 16 combined with the 18-methyl group (51. van der vange -et al.
(6) found similar effects on lipid metabolism with triphasic gestodene and
monophasic  xxxd1849xxx  indicating that gestodene is also a more selective
progestagen.
the aim of the present study is to assess and compare the intrinsic
hormonal properties of the older progestagens
( xxxd2751xxx 
and
levonoraestrell
with those of 3-keto-desoaestrel
(the active metabolite of
desogestrell
and gestodene in receptor s&dies.
the relative binding
affinities (rbas) of these compounds to the human progestagen and androgen
receptors from mcf-7 cells (cytosol and intact cells) were determined
using org 2058,  xxxd2067xxx  and dht as labelled ligands and the selectivity
indices (rba progesterone
receptor/rba
 xxxg183xxx ) of the compounds
were calculated.

discussion

in the present study we investigated the binding of four progestagens,

including two relatively old, viz.  xxxd2751xxx  and levonorgestrel, and
two progestagens of a new generation, e.g.  xxxd2067xxx  (active
metabolite of desogestrell and gestodene, to the progesterone and androgen
receptor. receptor binding of these four progestagens has never been
compared in a single study. binding results from separate studies (4,5,9)
can not be combined because the receptor source or ligands used are
different.
recalculation of the binding results of various studies to one reference
compound is sometimes done (10,111,
but may often lead to wrong estimates
because conditions in the various studies are different. in this study we
used two ligands (org 2058 and  xxxd2067xxx ) for the determination of the
binding to the  xxxg1737xxx . especially, the use of potent
ligands becomes important when potent progestagens are tested according to
the procedure described by rodbard (12) used in this study. the
reliability of the results becomes higher with more potent ligands as can
be seen from the confidence limits for gestodene when the results obtained
with org 2058 and  xxxd2067xxx  as ligands are compared (see table i). the
binding to the  xxxg1737xxx  in the cytosol fraction and intact
cells have been assessed. the existence of the cytosolic receptor is open
to question today because the receptors of many steroid hormones are
predominantly found to be associated with the nucleus (13). therefore, we
believe that the binding studies achieved with intact cells, by which the
binding to the nuclear receptor is measured, is more relevant than those
with the cytosolic receptor. we have chosen the mcf-7 cells as receptor
source for our binding studies since they are of human origin and possess
both progesterone and androgen receptors (2,141. the binding to the
 xxxg1737xxx  is related to the ovulatory inhibiting activity
(wanted effect) of progestagens whereas the binding to the androgen
receptor is associated with unwanted side effects of progestagens such as
effects on lipid metabolism (2,151. all four progestagens used in this
study are derived from 19-nortestosterone and may therefore possess some
residual intrinsic androgenic activity.
for the binding to the  xxxg1737xxx  the following ranking (low to
high) was found for the four progestagens using the values of intact cells
with  xxxd2067xxx  as ligand as the most relevant data:
 xxxd2751xxx <<levonorgestrel< xxxd2067xxx <gestodene.
the introduction of the 18-methyl group in  xxxd2751xxx  as in
levonorgestrel enhances the binding affinity and when this group is
combined with an ll-methylene group ( xxxd2067xxx )a further
increase is found. the combination of an n-methyl group and al5 group
(gestodene) gives an even higher binding than  xxxd2067xxx .
the binding results to the  xxxg183xxx  using again the data with
intact cells show the order (low to high):
 xxxd2751xxx < xxxd2067xxx <levonorgestrel
and gestodene.
the la-methyl group increases the binding to the  xxxg183xxx 
(levonorgestrel).when this group is combined with 11-methylene
(3-keto-deogestrel),the binding to the  xxxg183xxx  decreases, but
combined with the ai5 group (gestodene) the binding is not influenced.

these results show that the 11-methylene and al5 groups give quite
different properties to the progestagens derived from 19-nortestosterone.
this is also visualised when the selectivity indices (ratio of the binding
to the progesterone to that of  xxxg183xxx ) are calculated; a higher
selectivity index (although not significant) is found for  xxxd2067xxx  despite its lower affinity for the  xxxg1737xxx  than
gestodene. the selectivity indices are significantly higher for the new
progestagens than the old ones. the higher selectivity indicates stronger
binding to the  xxxg1737xxx  and/or weaker binding to the androgen
receptor.
receptor studies have their limitations because metabolism and
pharmacokinetics and dynamics are not considered. nevertheless such
studies give a clue to the intrinsic properties of a progestagen and may
contribute to the explanation of results of metabolic studies like lipid
studies. this can be valuable when preparations with the same composition
and regimens are compared like monophasic  xxxd1849xxx  and levonorgestrel
(2,3,6,15). van der vange (15) has shown that the effects of other
preparations on parameters like hdl-cholesterol and shbg fit well with the
results of binding studies. new progestagens like  xxxd2067xxx  and
gestodene are more selective than previous ones and ocs containing these
progestagens show therefore less unwanted (androgen-related)effects.
