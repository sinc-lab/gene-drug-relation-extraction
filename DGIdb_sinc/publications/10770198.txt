abstract
troglitazone, a novel oral insulin sensitizer, normalizes increased
plasma activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (pai-1) in
hyperinsulinemic patients such as women with polycystic ovary syndrome and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. however, underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated.
human hepatic and vascular cells, the main sources of circulating
pai-1, were studied in cell culture. in human hepatic cells, pai-1
accumulated in conditioned medium by 23% within 24 h after exposure to 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone (p ⫽ 0.001). the accumulation depended
on the concentration of troglitazone, but not that of insulin (known to
stimulate pai-1 synthesis). by contrast, in human aortic smooth

s

yndromes of insulin resistance are characterized by
derangements in endogenous fibrinolysis as well as
hyperinsulinemia (1, 2). these syndromes include the socalled metabolic syndrome or syndrome x, type 2 diabetes
mellitus early in its course, and the polycystic ovary syndrome. the metabolic syndrome is manifested by combinations of abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, increased serum low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, decreased serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol, impaired glucose tolerance, hyper(pro)insulinemia,
and hyperuricemia. patients with insulin resistance exhibit
increased concentrations in blood of plasminogen activator
inhibitor type 1 (pai-1), the primary physiological inhibitor
of plasminogen activators in blood (1). as a result, the dynamic balance between endogenous fibrinolysis and thrombosis is shifted toward thrombosis, potentially predisposing
to thrombotic events and acceleration of macroangiography
(3). results in epidemiological studies have demonstrated a
strong association between impaired fibrinolysis secondary
to increased activity of pai-1 in blood and the incidence of
cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease,
myocardial infarction, restenosis after coronary angioplasty,
as well as stenosis of carotid and peripheral arteries (rereceived august 20, 1999. revision received december 8, 1999. accepted december 21, 1999.

muscle cells, 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone decreased basal pai-1 expression
by 23% (p ⫽ 0.037) and decreased transforming growth factor-␤induced expression by 34% (p ⫽ 0.026). concomitant insulin had no
effect.  xxxg1766xxx  was decreased by 38% (p ⫽
0.002). in human endothelial cells, pai-1 was diminished by 32% (p ⬍
0.001), whereas  xxxg1766xxx  was unaffected.
the results suggest that the reduction in plasma activity of pai-1
induced by troglitazone in patients may reflect both directly mediated
diminution of its elaboration from vessel walls and indirectly mediated reduction of its hepatic synthesis secondary to attenuation of
hyperinsulinemia (known to increase the hepatic synthesis of pai-1).

viewed in ref. 4). in addition, results from studies in laboratory animals including transgenic animals have shown that
increased activity of pai-1 in blood exacerbates thrombosis
(reviewed in ref. 5). in subjects with insulin resistance, it
appears to reflect insulin- and  xxxg1193xxx -dependent augmentation of the synthesis of pai-1 by the liver, vascular wall
cells, or both, as judged from results of studies in vitro (6 –10)
and in vivo (3).
troglitazone is a novel oral insulin sensitizer that increases
glucose disposal in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (11,
12). besides glucose metabolism, troglitazone also affects
other (patho)physiological mechanisms, such as low density
lipoprotein receptor activity (13) and platelet aggregation
(14). in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, it diminishes not only the hyperinsulinemia, but also the markedly
increased concentration and activity of pai-1 in blood (2).
however, the mechanisms responsible have not yet been
fully elucidated. if its effects on pai-1 elaboration or degradation are direct, it may serve as a prototype for the development of drugs designed to normalize increased pai-1
in other clinical conditions. if its effects are indirect and
secondary to a reduction of insulin-mediated stimulation of
hepatic pai-1 synthesis, the importance of a reduction of
hyperinsulinemia as a therapeutic objective in the treatment
of patients with type 2 diabetes and other insulin-resistant
states would be accentuated.
the present study was performed to determine whether
one or both of those mechanisms are likely to be operative.
accordingly, hep g2 cells as well as vascular smooth muscle
and endothelial cells in culture were exposed to troglitazone
at concentrations consistent with those seen in blood in pa-

materials and methods
materials
human recombinant insulin acquired from sigma (deisenhofen, germany) was dissolved in 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  with 0.5% bovine albumin
(fraction v, low endotoxin, cell culture tested; sigma, st. louis, mo).
human recombinant transforming growth factor-␤1 (tgf␤1) was acquired from roche molecular biochemicals (mannheim, germany). immediately before use troglitazone (acquired from parke-davis, ann
arbor, mi) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (roth, karlsruhe, germany) and diluted in cell culture medium. the final concentration of
dimethylsulfoxide to which cells were exposed was 0.1% (vol/vol),
which affected neither cell morphology nor basal or insulin-stimulated
expression of pai-1. control experiments with vehicle alone were performed for each set of conditions studied.

hep g2 cell cultures
hep g2 cells, highly differentiated human hepatoma cells, were acquired from american type culture collection (hb 8065; manassas,
va). they were selected because they simulate normal human hepatocytes with respect to expression of pai-1 in response to agonists and
antagonists. they were grown to confluence, serum starved as described
previously (16), and subsequently exposed to fresh medium constituted
with selected concentrations of agonists.

human aortic smooth muscle cell (hasmc) cultures
hasmcs were prepared from segments of human ascending aorta
obtained fresh from donors of hearts used for cardiac transplantation in
the department of cardiovascular surgery at the university of heidelberg (heidelberg, germany). after removal of both the endothelium and
subendothelial layer and the adventitial layer, the remaining tunica
media tissue was cut into approximately 1-mm3 pieces and cultured as
explants in conventional cell culture dishes without specific coating.
within 4 weeks hasmcs had migrated out of the explants. cells were
verified to be smooth muscle cells as judged from typical hill and valley
morphology and their homogeneous staining with mouse monoclonal
anti-␣-actin antibody (roche molecular biochemicals) and goat fluorescein-conjugated antimouse igg antibody (sigma, st. louis, mo). for all
experiments, cells were used in passages 2–7 only.
hasmcs were grown to confluence in rpmi 1640 medium containing 25 mmol/l hepes and l-glutamine (biowhittaker, inc., verviers,
belgium), supplemented with 10% fbs (serva, heidelberg, germany)
and 1% antibiotic antimycotic solution (sigma; 100 u/ml penicillin, 100
␮g/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin, final concentrations). monolayers of confluent cells were serum starved in rpmi 1640
without supplements for 16 –24 h. after serum starvation the cells were
exposed to fresh medium constituted with selected concentrations of
agonists. for all experiments hasmcs from at least three different
donors were used and characterized separately.

human umbilical vein endothelial cell (huvec) cultures
huvec were prepared from umbilical cords conventionally with the
use of collagenase a from clostridium histolyticum (roche molecular
biochemicals). they were grown to confluence in medium 199 with
earle’s salts and l-glutamine (life technologies, inc., eggenstein, germany) supplemented with 10% fbs, 50 mg/l endothelial cell growth
supplement (harbor bioproducts, norwood, ma), and the same 1%
antibiotic antimycotic solution as that used for hasmcs. experiments
were performed with medium 199 supplemented with 10% fbs only.
the endothelial cells exhibited typical cobblestone morphology and
were used in primary culture (passage 1 only).

preparation of cell lysates
cells in culture were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(biowhittaker, inc.), incubated in 0.5% triton x-100, and transferred to

total protein
after selected time intervals conditioned media were supplemented
with tween-80 (final concentration, 0.01%) and stored at ⫺20 c until
assay. the concentrations of pai-1 protein in conditioned media and cell
lysates were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorption assay
(elisa) as described previously (8). active, latent, and  xxxg1766xxx -complexed
forms of pai-1 are detected with equal sensitivity with the elisa used.
the concentration of  xxxg1766xxx  protein was measured by elisa with the
use of an immobilized goat anti- xxxg1766xxx  and horseradish peroxidaselabeled anti- xxxg1766xxx  fab fragments (imubind total  xxxg1766xxx  stripwell elisa
material from american diagnostica, greenwich, ct).
the concentration of  xxxg1767xxx  protein was measured by elisa with the
use of a sandwich technique (immobilized mouse monoclonal antiurokinase antibody, urokinase, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat
antiurokinase antibody) and an immunological specificity and accuracy
control (tintelize  xxxg1767xxx , biopool, umea, sweden). the limit of sensitivity
for detection is approximately 0.1 ng/ml.
total protein was assayed with the use of a colorimetric microassay
procedure after solubilization of the protein with detergent (dc protein
assay, bio-rad laboratories, inc., hercules, ca).

effects of troglitazone on expression of pai-1 by
hep g2 cells

hep g2 cells were exposed to medium containing 0, 0.3,
1, or 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone for 24 h in the presence or absence
of 10 nmol/l insulin. these concentrations were selected
based on the concentrations in blood in vivo after the oral
administration of troglitazone in therapeutic doses of 5
mg/kg (15). concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and  xxxg941xxx  in
conditioned medium of the hep g2 cells we studied were
identical in the presence and absence of 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone over 24 h (data not shown), indicative of a lack of toxic
effects on the cells.
in the absence of insulin, troglitazone at all concentrations
significantly increased the accumulation of pai-1 in conditioned medium by up to 23% (at 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone, p ⫽
0.001; fig. 1). in the presence of 10 nmol/l insulin, the corresponding increases were statistically significant as well,
with 19% as a maximum (at 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone, p ⫽ 0.004).
in the absence of troglitazone, 10 nmol/l insulin induced a
1.7-fold increase in pai-1 secretion, confirming results obtained previously (8). of interest, the ratio of pai-1 accumulation in the presence and absence of insulin remained
constant (1.6- to 1.7-fold) regardless of the concentration of
troglitazone present. similar results were obtained with cells
exposed to troglitazone and 100 nmol/l insulin as well as to
0.1 and 1 nmol/l insulin (three experiments, each performed
in triplicate; data not shown). thus, troglitazone did not

insulin (table 1).
figure 2 demonstrates the dependence of the concentration of pai-1 in hep g2 cell lysates on the concentrations of

increased the concentration of pai-1 in cell lysates by 68%
(p ⫽ 0.015). in the presence of 10 nmol/l insulin, the increase
was 44% (p ⫽ 0.088). with increasing concentrations of troglitazone, the ratio of pai-1 concentrations in the cell lysates
with and without exposure of the cells to concomitant insulin
tended to decrease (from 1.7- to 1.4-fold).

tgf␤ was used as an agonist in experiments with

absence of 1 ng/ml tgf␤ for 24 h, concentration-dependent
diminution of accumulation of pai-1 in conditioned medium
was evident (fig. 3). thus, just as in the absence of exogenous
tgf␤, a reduction of pai-1 accumulation of more than 23%
was seen with 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone (p ⫽ 0.037). analogous
results were obtained with 1 ng/ml tgf␤ as well (34%
reduction with troglitazone; p ⫽ 0.026). the ratio between

regulation of pai-1 by troglitazone
effects of troglitazone on accumulation of pai-1 in huvecconditioned medium

incubation of huvec with graded concentrations of troglitazone (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 ␮g/ml) for 24 h
led to a reduction in the accumulation of pai-1 in conditioned medium of 7% with 1 ␮g/ml troglitazone (p ⫽ 0.023)
and 32% with 3 ␮g/ml troglitazone (p ⫽ 0.001) with no
associated change in the concentration of total protein in the
cell lysates. as was the case with hasmcs, 10 nmol/l insulin did not alter the results, as judged from the results in
three experiments, each performed in triplicate (data not
shown). insulin alone did not consistently influence pai-1
expression in huvecs. with 10 ␮g/ml troglitazone changes
in cell morphology associated with a marked decrease in
total protein in cell lysates was evident, consistent with the
cytopathic effects of the suprapharmacological concentrations.
effects of troglitazone on accumulation of  xxxg1766xxx  in huvecconditioned medium

the results of three experiments, each performed in triplicate
(data not shown).
discussion

the results of the present study indicate that the effects of
troglitazone in relieving inhibition of fibrinolysis in vivo by
lowering concentrations of pai-1 in blood are likely to be
attributable to two mechanisms. one is probably indirect and
secondary to diminution of hyperinsulinemia accompanying
amelioration of insulin resistance with consequently decreased hepatic synthesis of pai-1. a second is probably
direct diminution of pai-1 expression by vascular wall cell
elements that can result in diminished transendothelial
transport of pai-1 into blood (10). the first is likely to be
particularly important in view of the finding that hep g2 cell
accumulation of pai-1 in conditioned medium increased in
response to a lower concentration of troglitazone (0.3 ␮g/
ml) than that required to decrease accumulation of pai-1 in
conditioned medium of hasmcs and huvecs (1–3 ␮g/
ml). in addition, because troglitazone used clinically is administered orally, hepatocytes are exposed to concentrations
much higher than those impacting on luminal surfaces of
arterial walls throughout the systemic vasculature.
in this study cells were exposed to troglitazone at concentrations consistent with those seen in blood in patients
treated with troglitazone (15). in addition, hep g2 cells were
incubated with insulin at concentrations consistent with
those to which liver cells in vivo are exposed (17). thus, with
extrapolation of the data from the in vitro to the in vivo
situation, it may be expected that the reduction of hepatic
pai-1 synthesis secondary to the decreased concentration of
insulin after treatment with troglitazone is sufficient to overcome the direct stimulatory effect of troglitazone on hepatic
pai-1 synthesis. although hep g2 cells (an immortal cell
line) may not simulate all functional aspects of hepatocytes

1567

in vivo, in general, responses to agonists and antagonists of
synthesis and elaboration of pai-1 in vivo have been presaged by results with hep g2 cells in vitro.
the different effects of troglitazone on pai-1 synthesis in
liver cells, on the one hand, and in vascular smooth muscle
as well as vascular endothelial cells, on the other hand, are
of specific interest. the discrepant effects of insulin on pai-1
synthesis in hep g2 cells (significant induction) and in
hasmcs as well as huvecs (no statistically significant
induction and no effect at all, respectively) demonstrate major differences in the regulation of pai-1 synthesis in various
cell types. these may be explained by differences both in the
occurrence of receptors on the cell surface and in the pathways of intracellular signal transduction and may be modulated by polymorphisms in the pai-1 gene and its promoter.
thus, further investigations, including determining the impact of other thiazolidinediones on pai-1 synthesis, are
warranted.
the concept that the effect of troglitazone on pai-1 expression in blood in vivo is primarily indirect is supported
further by the close correlation between decreased concentrations of insulin in blood and corresponding differences in
pai-1 in hyperinsulinemic patients with the polycystic ovary
syndrome who have been treated with troglitazone (2). in
addition, metformin, an oral agent that decreases endogenous hepatic glucose output and is therefore insulin sparing,
decreases concentrations of pai-1 in such patients, most
likely because it decreases concentrations of insulin in blood
(18). troglitazone did not alter hep g2 cell accumulation of
 xxxg1767xxx , the plasminogen activator that predominates in tissue,
nor did it alter the concentration of total protein in cell lysates. thus, the induction of pai-1 expression appeared to be
at least relatively specific.
troglitazone did not alter the accumulation of  xxxg1766xxx  with
or without insulin in conditioned medium of huvec. by
contrast, it reduced accumulation of  xxxg1766xxx  in conditioned
medium of hasmcs, a finding consistent with a reduction
in concentrations of  xxxg1766xxx  in blood in patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome who are treated with troglitazone (2).
in view of the well recognized importance of elaboration of
 xxxg1766xxx  by endothelial cells, these results are consistent with a
predominant functional effect of reduced pai-1 release in
vessel walls. as both smooth muscle cells and endothelial
cells exhibited diminished secretion of pai-1, but only the
smooth muscle cells exhibited diminished  xxxg1766xxx  secretion in
response to troglitazone, the overall effect of the agent is
likely to be increase of vessel wall-dependent fibrinolytic
system activity. the troglitazone-induced reduction in  xxxg1766xxx 
occurred even in the absence of insulin. by contrast, the
antihyperglycemic effect of troglitazone is evident only when
insulin is present in experimental animals given the insulin
sensitizer (19). troglitazone appears to exert several effects
on vascular smooth muscle cells, including reduction of high
glucose-induced migration and proliferation (20).
the observations in the present study suggest that thiazolidinediones such as troglitazone will be useful in inducing
a favorable balance between fibrinolysis and thrombosis in
patients with insulin-resistant states. in addition, they imply
that these agents may attenuate derangements in the balance
between proteolysis and its inhibition within vessel walls

that have been implicated in accumulation of extracellular
matrix and augmentation of chemotaxis and cell migration
early in atherogenesis (21). by contrast, reductions in pai-1
in blood in vivo and normalization by troglitazone of fibrinolysis in blood in patients with insulin-resistant states are
not likely to depend exclusively on direct effects of troglitazone on pai-1 expression. rather, they appear likely to be
a consequence as well of a reduction in insulin resistance,
consequent diminution of prevailing concentrations of insulin in blood, and secondary diminution of augmented
pai-1 expression by the liver associated with a reduction of
hyperinsulinemia in patients with states of insulin resistance.
