the euryhaline teleost fundulus heteroclitus (i.e., killifish) is
a model organism that is utilized extensively to study the
homeostatic mechanisms regulating salt balance and to study
the effects of environmental toxicants on cellular function.
killifish can acclimate to abrupt and dramatic changes in the
salinity of seawater (14, 25–27, 29, 35). the ability to acclimate to increased salinity requires the gills to switch from
nacl absorption (freshwater) to nacl secretion (seawater) to
maintain nacl homeostasis (25, 44). cl⫺ secretion by mito-

chondrion-rich cells in the gill is a two-step process: cl⫺
uptake across the basolateral membrane is mediated by the
na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ ( xxxg2079xxx ) cotransporter, and the cl⫺ that enters
the cell via the  xxxg2079xxx  cotransporter is secreted into seawater
via cftr cl⫺ channels located in the apical plasma membrane
(25). cl⫺ secretion generates an apical-negative, transepithelial
voltage that provides the driving force for the paracellular
secretion of na⫹. upregulation of nacl secretion subsequent
to increased salinity is mediated by an increase in the number
of mitochondrion-rich cells and by increases in cftr, na⫹k⫹-atpase, and  xxxg2079xxx  (25, 26, 28, 35). plasma levels of
several hormones, including  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx , insulin-like
growth factor, and cortisol, rise when the salinity is increased,
and these hormones play an important role in acclimation (11,
23, 27). in killifish, transfer from freshwater to seawater is
accompanied by a rapid (1 h) and dramatic increase in plasma
cortisol levels that precedes increased cftr gene expression
(25, 27, 29, 35). two glucocorticoid receptors (gr) have been
identified in trout, and three have been identified in cichlid
fishes (9, 12). although there is no evidence that fish synthesize aldosterone, mineralocorticoid receptors (mr) have been
identified in fish and cortisol activates mr in fish (5, 12). it has
long been assumed that cortisol activation of the gr is required
for increased cftr gene expression in killifish and thereby the
ability to acclimate to increased salinity. although the importance of cortisol to acclimation in killifish is widely accepted,
there is little direct proof to support this concept. a recent
study examined the role of the gr in the ability of killifish to
acclimate to a change in salinity from 10 to 150% seawater
(26). ru-486, a gr antagonist, reduced camp-stimulated
cftr-mediated cl⫺ secretion in killifish opercular membranes. although this observation is consistent with a role of
the gr in acclimation to seawater, the effect of ru-486 on
cftr mrna was not evaluated. thus one of two goals of this
study was to test the hypothesis that cortisol activation of the
gr is required for increased cftr mrna expression and
thereby the ability of killifish to acclimate to increased salinity.
the second goal, described below, was to determine whether
environmental arsenic disrupts cortisol activation of the gr,
thereby blocking the increase in cftr mrna expression and
the ability of killifish to acclimate to increased salinity.
arsenic disrupts hormone-gr signaling and is considered
the number one environmental toxicant of concern both world-

2006; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00328.2006.—killifish are euryhaline
teleosts that adapt to rapid changes in the salinity of the seawater.
it is generally accepted that acclimation to seawater is mediated by
cortisol activation of the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), which
stimulates cftr mrna expression and cftr-mediated cl⫺ secretion by the gill. because there is no direct evidence in killifish
that the gr stimulates cftr gene expression, quantitative pcr
studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that cortisol activation of gr upregulates cftr mrna expression and that this
response is required for acclimation to seawater. inhibition of the
gr by ru-486 prevented killifish from acclimating to increased
salinity and blocked the increase in cftr mrna. in contrast,
inhibition of the  xxxg1602xxx  by spironolactone had
no effect on acclimation to seawater. thus acclimation to increased
salinity in killifish requires signaling via the gr and includes an
increase in cftr gene expression. because arsenic, a toxic metalloid that naturally occurs in the aquatic environment, has been
shown to disrupt gr transcriptional regulation in avian and mammalian systems, studies were also conducted to determine whether
arsenic disrupts cortisol-mediated activation of cftr gene expression in this in vivo fish model and thereby blocks the ability of
killifish to acclimate to increased salinity. arsenic prevented acclimation to seawater and decreased cftr protein abundance.
however, arsenic did not disrupt the gr-induced increase in cftr
mrna. thus arsenic blocks acclimation to seawater in killifish by
a mechanism that does not disrupt gr-mediated induction of
cftr gene expression.

materials and methods

animals. studies were performed in compliance with institutional
animal care and use guidelines approved by mount desert island
biological laboratory (mdibl; a3562-01) and dartmouth medical
school (a3259-01). killifish were collected from northeast creek
(bar harbor, me) and held in aquaria containing running seawater at
the mdibl (salisbury cove, me) or artificial seawater (instant
ocean) at dartmouth college for at least 2 wk to ensure acclimation
to seawater. the osmolality and cl⫺ concentration were similar in
seawater and instant ocean. fish were acclimated to freshwater by a
reduction in salinity of the water to 10% seawater for 2 wk and then
replacement of the 10% seawater with “soft” freshwater for 2 wk (4)
for an additional 2 wk (27). acclimation to seawater was achieved by
ajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

transferring freshwater-acclimated fish to 100% seawater. some fish
were exposed to arsenic in the seawater (sodium arsenite). identical
results were obtained at the mdibl and dartmouth.
drug treatment. freshwater-acclimated fish were either untreated
or injected intraperitoneally with vehicle (ethanol control), ru-486
(40 and 100 ␮g/g body wt), a gr antagonist, or spironolactone (100
␮g/g body wt), a mr antagonist. the concentrations of these drugs
have been used by others to induce steroid receptor blockade in fish
(26, 34, 43). subsequent to ip injection, fish were either returned to
freshwater or placed in 100% seawater. results in the untreated and
vehicle-injected fish were similar (see below). thus ip injections,
which have the potential to induce stress and increase cortisol levels,
had no overt effect on the parameters measured in this study.
blood and tissue collection. fish were anesthetized in tricaine
(ms-222; 0.1%), and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture in
heparinized hematocrit tubes. plasma was obtained by centrifugation
(10,000 g, 3 min) and was stored at ⫺80° c until cl⫺ concentration
(p[cl⫺]) was measured by amperometric titration using a labconco
chloridometer. tissue was collected for isolation of mrna for quantitative rt-pcr or for analysis of arsenic levels by inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (icp-ms; see below).
toxicity tests. acute (96 h) toxicity tests were performed according
to recommendations given by the u.s. epa (environmental monitoring systems laboratory, methods for measuring the acute toxicity of
effluents and receiving waters to freshwater and marine organisms) to examine the effects of arsenic on freshwater- and seawateracclimated fish, as well as fish exposed to arsenic in freshwater and
transferred to seawater (15). for the latter, freshwater-acclimated fish
were exposed to arsenic in the seawater for 96 h. to determine the
effects of this arsenic exposure on the ability of the fish to acclimate
to changing salinity, these fish were transferred immediately to seawater containing no arsenic for 48 h, and mortality was observed
during this period. a group of fish that were similarly exposed to
arsenic in freshwater and returned to freshwater containing no arsenic
for 48 h served as a control for the transfer experiment. no mortality
was observed in this group. arsenic test solutions were prepared with
natural seawater or very soft reconstituted freshwater (4) from stock
made with naaso2 (purum grade; fluka, buchs, switzerland) dissolved in deionized water. toxicity tests were conducted in 1-liter
polyethylene aquaria (10 fish/aquarium) at 13°c with three replicate
aquaria per treatment. test water was aerated and replaced daily, and
water samples were taken at the start and conclusion of each test for
measurement of total ammonia, ph, salinity, and temperature. there
were no appreciable differences in water quality parameters over the
test periods.
a series of tests was also conducted to determine the time course
of mortality following transfer from freshwater to seawater in fish
receiving drug treatments (detailed above) and exposed to arsenic in
freshwater. test design was similar to that described above, with the
exception that six replicate aquaria, each containing 10 fish, were used
per treatment group, and mortality was assessed at 0, 24, 48, 72, and
96 h following transfer. also, these arsenic tests differed from those
described above in that fish were exposed to arsenic in freshwater for
48 h and then either retained in freshwater or transferred to seawater
containing the same concentration of arsenic.
isolation of rna and quantitative rt-pcr. quantitative rt-pcr
experiments were conducted to examine the effects of increased
salinity, arsenic, and ru-486 on cftr gene expression by the gill. to
isolate total rna from gill, tissue was obtained as described above
and immediately stored in rnalater (ambion, austin, tx). total
rna was isolated from 30 mg of tissue [from 3 animals to reduce
animal-to-animal variation (19)] per observation using the rnaeasy
mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca). rna was treated with dnase
(dna-free; ambion) to remove contaminating dna. total rna was
quantified using spectrophotometric optical density (od260/280) measurements (nanodrop; nanodrop technologies, rockland, de), and
rna quality was assessed using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (agi292 • february 2007 •

wide and in the united states, according to the world health
organization and the agency for toxic substances and disease registry. arsenic is a toxic metalloid that naturally occurs
in the environment. although arsenical compounds are used to
treat several diseases, exposure to inorganic arsenic in occupational settings, at toxic waste sites, and from natural sources
in the environment, including well water, is a major health
concern (1, 18, 20, 21). chronic exposure to arsenic-contaminated water or air has been linked to cancers of the skin, lung,
bladder, liver, and kidney and increased risk of type 2 diabetes,
vascular disease, cardiovascular disease, and reproductive and
developmental disorders (1, 18). the environmental protection
agency (epa) has set a human health consumption criterion
for total dissolved arsenic in seawater of 0.0175 parts per
billion (ppb), a level that is estimated to pose increased risk to
human health if exceeded (31). however, these concentrations
are often exceeded, even in clean coastal waters that typically
range from 1 to 3 ppb (31), and in polluted seawater, arsenic
concentrations ⬎1,000 ppb (13 ␮m) have been reported (7).
the current epa-regulated u.s. drinking water standard is
10 ppb.
the mechanism(s) by which arsenic increases disease risk is
not clear. arsenic at low concentrations (i.e., ⬃1–100 ppb) is
a potent endocrine disrupter, altering hormone-activated gene
transcription mediated by the gr (6, 16). chronic exposure to
arsenic inhibits cftr transcription in human t84 colon epithelial cells in vitro (22). in addition, acute exposure to arsenic
reduces cftr-mediated cl⫺ secretion (ic50 ⫽ 305 ppb)
across the opercular membrane of the killifish, in part by
inhibiting mitochondrial respiration (39). because so little is
known about the cellular mechanism(s) by which arsenic
causes human disease and affects the function of ion channels
and transporters and because arsenic disrupts transcriptional
activation by hormone-bound gr, studies were conducted to
determine whether arsenic affects the ability of killifish to
acclimate to an increase in salinity by reducing cortisol-grstimulated cftr gene expression.
we report that the gr antagonist ru-486 inhibited the
salinity-induced increase in cftr gene expression, as determined by quantitative pcr, and the ability of killifish to
acclimate to increased salinity. by contrast, the mr antagonist
spironolactone had no effect on acclimation. in addition, arsenic blocked the ability of killifish to acclimate to increased
salinity. however, contrary to our hypothesis, arsenic did not
alter cortisol-stimulated gr activation of cftr gene expression, although it substantially decreased cftr protein abundance.

gr, but not mr, is required for seawater acclimation. to
determine whether activation of the gr is essential for killifish
to acclimate to increased salinity, we left freshwater-acclimated fish untreated (control) or injected them intraperitoneally with either vehicle (ethanol, sham) or ru-486 (40 and 100
␮g/g), a gr antagonist, and they were immediately either
returned to freshwater or placed in 100% seawater (fig. 1).
there was no significant mortality of control or sham fish
returned to freshwater or placed in seawater. all ru-486treated fish returned to freshwater survived. by contrast, there
was significant mortality (⬃90% at 96 h in the 100 ␮g/g group
and ⬃50% at 96 h in the 40 ␮g/g group) in ru-486-treated fish
transferred to seawater. these results are consistent with the
conclusion that activation of gr by endogenous cortisol is
required for killifish to successfully acclimate to increased
salinity.
recent studies have suggested that cortisol may activate the
mr in fish and thereby play a role in acclimation to seawater
(5, 12). to determine whether activation of mr is essential for
killifish to acclimate to increased salinity, we injected freshwater-acclimated fish intraperitoneally with spironolactone
(100 ␮g/g), a potent and specific antagonist of mr, and they
were immediately either returned to freshwater or placed in
100% seawater. all spironolactone-treated fish returned to
freshwater or placed in seawater survived (fig. 1). these
results are consistent with the conclusion that activation of the
gr, but not the mr, by endogenous cortisol is required for
killifish to acclimate to increased salinity.
the gr antagonist ru-486 disrupts cl⫺ homeostasis. to
examine the effect of ru-486 on cl⫺ homeostasis, we collected blood from fish for measurements of p[cl⫺]. as shown
in fig. 2, transfer of freshwater-acclimated killifish to seawater
increased p[cl⫺]. this increase in p[cl⫺] was greater in fish
treated with ru-486. these data indicate that the ru-486induced mortality in fish transferred from freshwater to seawater is most likely caused by the inability to maintain p[cl⫺] by
excreting cl⫺ via cftr in the gills.

(abi prism 7700 sequence detection system). duplicate and/or triplicate reactions of each sample were incubated at 95° for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95° and 1 min at 60°. in preliminary
studies, quantitative rt-pcr products were run on an lmp agarose
gel to confirm product size, subcloned into pcr4-topo (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca), and submitted for sequence analysis to confirm identity of the products. dilutions of cftr, na⫹-k⫹-atpase, and
 xxxg2079xxx  plasmid dna prepared from the killifish quantitative rtpcr products were used to construct a standard curve. the standard
curves showed a correlation coefficient close to 1 (r2 ⬎ 0.99) and
were linear over a 6-log range. equivalent amplification efficiencies of
standard and target molecules were observed, and sybr green
melting curve dissociation analysis and sequencing revealed a single
pcr product for each target. raw data were analyzed; baseline and
threshold values were set and gene expression was interpolated using
the external standard curves. the cdna generated during reverse

lc50 (lethal concentration to 50% of fish) values were equivalent in freshwater- and seawater-acclimated fish. however, in
freshwater fish transferred to seawater, the lc50 value decreased significantly from 230.4 to 163.2 ␮m. thus arsenic
was more toxic to fish stressed with a freshwater-to-seawater
challenge.
to examine in more detail the time course of arsenic
toxicity, we treated freshwater-acclimated fish with arsenic
(106 or 160 ␮m) for 48 h and then either retained them in
freshwater containing the same concentration of arsenic or
transferred them to seawater containing the same concentration
of arsenic (fig. 5). there was no mortality of control fish (no
arsenic) returned to freshwater or transferred to seawater. in
addition, there was no mortality of arsenic-exposed fish at the
lower dose when placed in seawater. by contrast, after 48 –96
h in seawater containing 160 ␮m arsenic, there was significant
mortality (⬃45% at 96 h). together, these data demonstrate
that arsenic in the water inhibits the ability of killifish to
acclimate to an increase in salinity at concentrations that are
not otherwise toxic to fish not challenged with increased
salinity.

arsenic caused mortality by disrupting cl⫺ homeostasis, we

the gr antagonist ru-486 blocks seawater induction of
cftr gene expression. transfer of freshwater-acclimated fish
to seawater is thought to enhance cftr mrna expression via
increased cortisol, which activates the gr. thus studies were
conducted to determine whether ru-486 inhibits acclimation
to seawater, at least in part, by blocking the cortisol-grinduced increase in cftr mrna expression. first, studies
were conducted to examine the time course of increased cftr
mrna levels following transfer from freshwater to seawater.
transfer of freshwater-acclimated killifish to seawater increased cftr mrna expression in gill after a delay of 24 h
(fig. 3). this observation confirms several previous studies
(27, 35) and established the 24-h time point following transfer
to seawater as optimal for investigating changes in cftr
mrna. at this time point, ru-486 completely inhibited the
2.5-fold increase in cftr mrna that was observed in fish
transferred from freshwater to seawater (fig. 4). this observation provides the first direct evidence in killifish that activation
of the gr by endogenous cortisol mediates an increase in
cftr mrna expression when fish are transferred from freshwater to seawater.
arsenic inhibits seawater acclimation. to determine
whether arsenic is a potential endocrine disruptor in killifish,
we performed arsenic toxicity tests in fish acclimated to freshwater and seawater and in freshwater-acclimated fish transferred to seawater. the effects of arsenic on mortality, evaluated for 48 h following arsenic exposure, are presented in

arsenic and killifish

significantly increased p[cl⫺] in freshwater-acclimated fish
exposed to seawater (fig. 6). a higher concentration of arsenic
(160 ␮m), which also caused some mortality, elicited an even
greater increase in p[cl⫺] when freshwater-acclimated fish
were exposed to seawater. these data suggest that arsenic
disrupts cl⫺ homeostasis.
arsenic does not inhibit seawater induction of cftr gene
expression. our initial hypothesis was that arsenic prevents
acclimation to seawater by disrupting gr activation of cftr
mrna expression. to test this hypothesis, we exposed freshwater-acclimated fish to arsenic (66, 106, or 160 ␮m) for 48 h
and then directly transferred them to seawater containing the
same arsenic concentrations for 24 h. subsequently, cftr
mrna in gill was measured using quantitative rt-pcr (fig.
7). as observed in earlier studies, transfer of freshwateracclimated fish to seawater increased cftr mrna levels (25,
26, 28, 35). however, contrary to our hypothesis, arsenic
concentrations of 66, 106, or 160 ␮m did not significantly
reduce cftr mrna levels at 24 h (compared with control
fish). because arsenic caused significant mortality only after
48 h (see fig. 5), we speculated that arsenic might decrease

significant (45%) mortality] also failed to decrease cftr
mrna levels. these results do not support our initial hypothesis that arsenic prevents acclimation to seawater by disrupting
gr activation of cftr gene expression.
arsenic decreases cftr protein abundance. additional
studies were conducted to determine whether arsenic abrogated
the ability to acclimate to increased salinity by reducing cftr
protein levels. in these experiments, freshwater-acclimated fish
were exposed to arsenic (160 ␮m) or vehicle for 48 h and then
directly transferred to seawater containing the same arsenic
concentrations or to vehicle for 1, 2, or 3 days. subsequently,
cftr protein in gill was measured using western blot analysis
(fig. 9). in the absence of arsenic, transfer from freshwater to
seawater elicited a small increase in cftr protein expression
in gill (fig. 9). however, in fish exposed to arsenic and
transferred from freshwater to seawater, cftr protein abundance was negligible and significantly less at every time point
compared with fish not exposed to arsenic. thus, although
arsenic did not alter the increase in cftr mrna in freshwater
fish transferred to seawater, arsenic dramatically reduced
cftr protein abundance in freshwater fish transferred to
seawater. thus it is likely that arsenic blocks acclimation to
seawater by reducing cftr protein abundance.

arsenic and killifish
discussion

the basolateral membrane is mediated by the  xxxg2079xxx  cotransporter, and the cl⫺ that enters the cell across the basolateral
membrane is secreted into seawater via cftr cl⫺ channels
located in the apical plasma membrane (25). the na⫹-k⫹atpase, by maintaining a low intracellular na⫹ concentration,
facilitates cl⫺ uptake across the basolateral membrane via
 xxxg2079xxx . thus arsenic also may have disrupted cl⫺ homeostasis by affecting na⫹-k⫹-atpase and/or  xxxg2079xxx  gene expression or protein abundance. arsenic (160 ␮m) did not affect
na⫹-k⫹-atpase (fig. 10) or  xxxg2079xxx  (fig. 11) mrna expression or protein abundance when fish were transferred from
freshwater to seawater.
arsenic accumulates in killifish gill. given the effects of
arsenic on p[cl⫺] and the lack of overt toxicity at water
concentrations up to 106 ␮m, we were interested in the extent
to which arsenic actually accumulates in the tissues of the
killifish over the course of these experiments. arsenic levels
were measured in the gills of control and exposed killifish by
using high-resolution icp-ms. freshwater-acclimated fish
were maintained in freshwater or transferred to seawater containing 0, 106, or 160 ␮m arsenic for 96 h (fig. 12). the
background arsenic concentration was 0.002 ⫾ 0.001 ␮mol/g
in the gill of freshwater fish and 0.004 ⫾ 0.001 ␮mol/g in
seawater fish in nominally arsenic-free seawater (fig. 12; p ⫽
not significant). gill arsenic levels increased significantly to
0.015 ␮mol/g in fish exposed to 106 ␮m arsenic in the water,
a 2.4-fold increase, and increased to 0.057 ␮mol/g in fish
exposed to 160 ␮m arsenic in the water, a 12-fold increase
(fig. 12). thus, despite high concentrations of arsenic in the
water, the internal concentrations of arsenic in the gills of
exposed fish were relatively modest. the relevance of these
tissue levels of arsenic to levels measured in fish exposed to
arsenic in the environment and with regard to endocrine disruption are discussed below.

the major new observations in this report are that the gr
antagonist ru-486 inhibits cftr gene expression, increases
p[cl⫺], and blocks the ability of killifish to acclimate to an
increase in salinity from ⬃0 to 100% seawater. by contrast,
spironolactone, an antagonist of mr, had no effect on acclimation to seawater. thus the mr does not appear to be
essential for killifish to adapt to increased salinity. arsenic also
blocked the ability of killifish to adapt to increased salinity by
reducing cftr protein abundance. however, arsenic had no
effect on the gr activation of cftr mrna expression,
suggesting that arsenic affects cftr protein abundance at one
or more posttranscriptional steps.
our results with ru⫽486 are consistent with recent observations that ru-486 inhibits camp-cftr-mediated cl⫺ secretion by killifish operculum (26). together with our quantitative rt-pcr results, these data are consistent with the
conclusion that endogenous cortisol activates the gr and
thereby increases gill cftr mrna expression. this enhances
cftr-mediated cl⫺ secretion by gill and operculum, thereby
facilitating the ability of fish to acclimate to increased salinity.
it should be noted that in the study by marshall et al. (26),

r1058

arsenic and killifish

ru-486 did not cause mortality in fish transferred from brackish water (10% seawater) to 150% seawater over a 48-h period.
by contrast, there was significant mortality (⬃90%) over 96 h
in our study, in which ru-486-treated fish were transferred
from freshwater to 100% seawater. this is likely due to
differences in experimental protocols, primarily the degree to
which the salinity was changed, which in the present study was
more severe and likely to impose more stress on osmoregulatory mechanisms.
our data demonstrate that the gr and not the mr plays an
essential role in acclimation to seawater and upregulation of
cftr mrna expression in killifish gill and operculum. ru486, a potent gr antagonist, but not spironolactone, an mr
antagonist, blocked acclimation to seawater. ru-486 also
blocked the seawater-stimulated increase in cftr mrna. it is
not known whether the mr is expressed in killifish, although
the mr is expressed in other teleosts. thus the negative result
with spironolactone could be due to an absence of mr in
killifish. it also must be considered that endogenous cortisol
may activate cftr mrna expression and cl⫺ secretion by
binding to other steroid receptors such as the progesterone or
estrogen receptors. however, we think this is unlikely because
of the known ligand specificity of these highly conserved
receptors in other systems and because estrogen has been
shown to inhibit osmoregulation in killifish (24). activation of
the estrogen and progesterone receptors also reduces cftr
cl⫺ secretion in pancreatic and t84 cells (36, 41). moreover,

progesterone receptors are not highly expressed in the gill (32).
together, these results strongly point to the gr being a major
regulator of this adaptive response in killifish.
arsenic prevented acclimation to increased salinity by a
mechanism that did not involve disruption of gr activation of
cftr mrna expression. measurements of cellular arsenic
accumulation in gill revealed that arsenic in the water significantly increased tissue levels of arsenic to 0.057 ␮mol/g, a
value comparable to levels previously observed to disrupt
hormone regulation of gene expression in killifish liver and
mammalian cells. for example, in killifish exposed to low
levels of arsenic (10.4 ␮m arsenic in 20% seawater) for 2 wk,
liver arsenic concentration increased to 0.13 ␮mol/g, a concentration that inhibited cortisol activation of  xxxg1316xxx  mrna
expression in liver but not cortisol activation of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase mrna expression (5a). these observations may explain, at least in part, why in the present study
arsenic had no effect on the gr stimulation of cftr mrna
expression. nonetheless, the ability of arsenic to block acclimation to seawater, increase p[cl⫺], and decrease cftr protein abundance at concentrations that did not alter cftr
mrna expression suggest that other mechanisms are principally responsible for this block in the adaptive response. since
the gr mediates many cellular processes, these effects could
result from disruption of gr signaling by arsenic at these other
steps (2, 40, 46), but given the many cellular targets and effects
of arsenic, it also is possible that these effects are mediated by
other targets and other mechanisms.
because arsenic dramatically decreased cftr protein abundance, increased p[cl⫺], and also caused significant mortality,
these data suggest that arsenic disrupted the ability of fish to
regulate nacl homeostasis. several mechanisms that do not
involve disruption of gr activation of cftr mrna expression should be considered. first, arsenic dramatically reduced
cftr protein abundance, an observation consistent with the
view that arsenic has posttranslational effects on cftr. recent
studies have demonstrated that low-level acute and chronic
arsenic exposure leads to upregulation of genes associated with
the proteosome-mediated protein degradation pathway (45)
(hamilton jw, ihnat ma, davey j, hampton t, and andrew
a, unpublished studies) and accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins (8). thus it is likely that arsenic reduced cftr protein

increased salinity. in addition, arsenic blocked the ability of
killifish to acclimate to increased salinity. interestingly, this
mechanism does not appear to involve disruption of gr activation of cftr gene expression. however, the ability of
arsenic to block acclimation, while simultaneously increasing
plasma chloride levels and decreasing cftr protein abundance suggests that these effects are mediated by an effect of
arsenic on cftr abundance and/or function. we hypothesize
that arsenic acts as an endocrine disruptor in killifish by
altering one or more gr-mediated posttranscriptional steps
that regulate cftr protein abundance. future studies need to
focus on determining whether this involves other arsenicsensitive gr-mediated events and/or other non-gr-dependent
pathways.

abundance, at least in part, by activating proteosomal degradation of cftr. in a previous study, we reported that arsenic
rapidly (minutes) and reversibly inhibited cftr-mediated cl⫺
secretion across the operculum by inhibiting mitochondrion
respiration (39). it is unlikely that this effect of arsenic extended to the 48- to 96-h treatment period in this study, because
inhibition by arsenic of mitochondrion respiration is transient,
and after 48 –96 h, arsenic has no effect on mitochondrial
respiration in either operculum or kidney (miller d, shaw jr,
and stanton ba, unpublished observations). consistent with
the view that the concentration of arsenic used in the present
study did not cause cell stress, arsenic had no effect on actin or
hsp70 expression as determined by western blot analysis (see
materials and methods). moreover, arsenic did not affect
na⫹-k⫹-atpase or  xxxg2079xxx  mrna expression or protein
abundance. thus the chronic effects of arsenic on killifish do
not appear to involve a general cellular stress response or to be
nonspecific. arsenic may have other effects on cellular function that reduce cftr-mediated cl⫺ secretion, including effects on signaling pathways, and other posttranslational mechanisms that affect cftr function. elucidation of other mechanism(s) by which arsenic disrupts osmoregulation in killifish
is under investigation and is beyond the scope of the present
report.
it is interesting to note that the adverse effect of arsenic in
these experiments was exacerbated when the animals were
stressed with an increase in salinity. the same arsenic concentrations that were lethal in this salinity challenge were not
overtly toxic in either freshwater- or seawater-adapted animals.
this is a common paradigm for arsenic effects, where it may
appear to have little or no obvious effects by itself but in
combination with another agent or stressor will greatly exacerbate the other condition. for example, inorganic arsenic
alone has been consistently negative for carcinogenesis in
animal bioassays, but arsenic in drinking water greatly enhances the tumorigenicity of ultraviolet radiation in a mouse
model (33). similar synergistic or potentiating effects of arsenic have been seen for endocrine disruption (6, 16), angiogenesis (17, 38), and dna damage and repair (3, 13). human
epidemiology studies also have shown that arsenic is strongly
synergistic with cigarette smoking for risk of lung cancer (10,
37). this has interesting experimental and practical implications in evaluating the pathophysiological effects of arsenic.
although the concentration of arsenic in seawater that
blocked acclimation in the current study is higher than that
observed even in polluted seawater, we believe the data in this
study are environmentally relevant, because the tissue arsenic
levels we observed in our 24- to 96-h experiments are lower
than the tissue values observed in wild killifish collected from
polluted waters. for example, in a california study, killifish
were collected from contaminated water and had tissue arsenic
levels of ⬃0.41 ␮mol/g (30), a value some seven times higher
than that of the level of 0.057 ␮mol/g we observed in our
experiments. thus, although higher external levels may be
required experimentally in short-term studies to achieve sufficient intracellular levels, it is important to compare tissue and
intracellular levels rather than external levels when comparing
effects.
in summary, we report that the gr appears to be essential
for killifish to successfully acclimate to increased salinity. by
contrast, the mr is not essential for killifish to acclimate to
