family of membrane proteins that mediate the actions of the
endogenous catecholamines, the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, and the hormone epinephrine. similar to rhodopsin, these
proteins are proposed to traverse the plasma membrane in a
series of seven transmembrane-spanning ␣-helical domains
linked by three intracellular and three extracellular loops (1).
in accordance with the observation that the greatest structural
conservation is localized to the transmembrane helical domains
of the receptor, the catecholamine binding pocket is also localized to these regions. mutagenesis studies in our laboratory
and others have identified that the endogenous agonist in
biogenic amine receptors is stabilized in the binding pocket by
ionic, hydrogen bond, and aromatic/hydrophobic interactions
involving residues on  xxxg2318xxx ,  xxxg2318xxx , and tm6, although there are
various modulations of these interactions between the families
(2–5). we have also recently shown that ␣1-ars and perhaps
some other biogenic amine receptors have additional aromatic/
hydrophobic interactions with the endogenous agonist to residues in tm4 and  xxxg2318xxx  (6).
however, our knowledge of how antagonists bind to the
adrenergic receptor family is limited. mutagenesis studies in
our laboratory have identified that the subtype selectivity of
two ␣1a-ar antagonists,  xxxd2914xxx  and wb4101, is conferred by interactions with three consecutive residues of the
second extracellular loop (7). similar results were also obtained
in the  xxxg1110xxx  (8) and the opioid receptor (9). this
observation indicates that in contrast to agonist binding, which
is localized to the interior core of the receptor, antagonists
interact with residues closer to the extracellular surface of
adrenergic receptors, above the plane of the agonist binding
pocket. further point contacts between ␣1-antagonists and extracellular residues of this receptor could not be identified
using a series of ␣1a-/␤2-ar chimeras. therefore, the highaffinity binding of these drugs to the receptor must involve
additional interactions with residues within the transmembrane domains of the receptor (10). other previous mutagenesis studies have indicated the importance of phenylalanine
residues located close to the extracellular surface of the receptor in antagonist binding at adrenergic receptors. a single
phenylalanine residue about two turns into the tm7 domain of
the ␣2-ar (phe-412) was shown to promote high-affinity binding of yohimbine (11). mutagenesis of a phenylalanine residue
(phe-86) at the surface of tm2 in the ␣1a-ar accounts for the
␣1a versus ␣1d selectivity of dihydropyridine antagonists such
as niguldipine (12). furthermore, a phenylalanine residue
(phe-310 of the ␣1b-ar) in tm6 has been identified as being
important not only for agonist binding but also for the binding
of certain ␣1-antagonists (13). in light of these studies and
given that the ␣1-antagonists contain high aromatic/hydropho-

although agonist binding in adrenergic receptors is
fairly well understood and involves residues located in
transmembrane domains 3 through 6, there are few residues reported that are involved in antagonist binding.
in fact, a major docking site for antagonists has never
been reported in any  xxxg89xxx . it has
been speculated that antagonist binding is quite diverse
depending upon the chemical structure of the antagonist, which can be quite different from agonists. we now
report the identification of two phenylalanine residues
in transmembrane domain 7 of the ␣1a-adrenergic receptor (phe-312 and phe-308) that are a major site of antagonist affinity. mutation of either phe-308 or phe-312 resulted in significant losses of affinity (4 –1200-fold) for
the antagonists  xxxd3000xxx , wb4101, bmy7378, (ⴙ) niguldipine, and 5-methylurapidil, with no changes in affinity
for phenethylamine-type agonists such as epinephrine,
 xxxd2601xxx , or phenylephrine. interestingly, both residues are involved in the binding of all imidazoline-type
agonists such as oxymetazoline,  xxxd1707xxx , and clonidine,
confirming previous evidence that this class of ligand
binds differently than phenethylamine-type agonists
and may be more antagonist-like, which may explain
their partial agonist properties. in modeling these interactions with previous mutagenesis studies and using
the current backbone structure of rhodopsin, we conclude that antagonist binding is docked higher in the
pocket closer to the extracellular surface than agonist
binding and appears skewed toward transmembrane
domain 7.

antagonist binding at ␣1-adrenergic receptors

25367

bic character, we continued our investigation into the role of
aromaticity/hydrophobicity in antagonist binding at ␣1-ars.
we now report the importance of two conserved phenylalanine
residues near the extracellular surface of tm7 involved in
nonselective binding for several ␣1-antagonists. our studies
suggest that ␣1-antagonists bind the receptor in an elevated
pocket from agonist binding that is also skewed toward tm7.
experimental procedures

fig. 1. sequence alignment of tm7 among cloned adrenergic
family members. residues mutated in the rat ␣1a (phe-308 and
phe-312) are shown in bold along with residues conserved in the corresponding position in other adrenergic receptors. the numbering is in
reference to the rat ␣1a sequence (14). amino acids are represented by
the one-letter code.
buffer, in a total assay volume of 250 ␮l. nonspecific binding was
defined as the amount of radioactivity that remained bound to the
filters in the presence of 10⫺4 m  xxxd2914xxx .
data analysis—competition binding data were analyzed using the
nonlinear regression functions of the noniterative curve fitting program
graphpad prism. binding affinities (ki) were determined by transformation of the program-calculated ic50 value using the cheng-prusoff
equation. the binding data for each ligand were modeled to one- or
two-site binding. the most suitable model was determined by performing an f test comparison of the least sum of squares fit of the data to
these equations. statistically significant differences in the affinities of
agonists and antagonists were determined by t test analysis.
molecular modeling—models depicting the binding interactions of
antagonists to the ␣1a-ar were generated as described previously using
insight ii molecular modeling software from biosym technologies (4, 7).
the coordinates of the ␣-carbon positions were determined by an overlay of the ␣1a-ar residues with the tm coordinates of rhodopsin (16).
results

fig. 1 shows the comparison of residues located in tm7 for
the ␣1-ars as well as all other adrenergic receptors. the biogenic amine family has a consensus domain of wxgxnsxxnpxxy that is thought to be involved in signal transduction and
sequestration but not directly involved in binding per se. (17).
therefore, we focused our attention on aromatic residues located closer to the extracellular border. tm7 has two aromatic
residues; both are absolutely conserved in both the ␣1- and
␣2-ar subtypes, but not in the ␤-ar subtypes. these two residues, phe-308 and phe-312 in the ␣1a-ar subtype, are predicted to be near the extracellular surface of the receptor (fig.
2), with phe-308 located in the first helical turn, and phe-312
located in the second turn on tm7. the analogous residue to
phe-312 in the ␣2-ar is also thought to confer ␣2-ar versus
␤-ar selectivity for yohimbine (11). to study the importance of
these residues in ␣1-ar binding, we mutated phe-308 to either
ala or leu (to examine hydrophobicity versus aromaticity, respectively), and we mutated phe-312 to either asn or ala (to
examine ␣-ar to ␤-ar selectivity and ␣1-ar hydrophobicity,
respectively).
binding phenotype at phe-308 mutations—binding results
for a series of ␣1-ar, ␣2-ar, and ␤-ar antagonists are presented in table i. all binding curves resulted in one-site fits. in
saturation binding studies, the radiolabeled antagonist 125iheat bound to each of the mutated receptors with comparable
affinity and density as determined for the wild type ␣1a-ar. to
determine changes in ␣1-antagonist affinity, a number of ligands were tested at the phe-308 mutants. there were no
changes in affinity at either mutant for  xxxd2914xxx ,  xxxd3000xxx , or 5-methylurapidil. however, wb4101 (10 –25-fold),
bmy7378 (3– 4-fold), and (⫹) niguldipine (8 –30-fold) had lower
affinity at either substitution. we then tested both ␣2-ar and
␤-ar antagonists to address cross-family selectivity issues. all
ligands tested but  xxxd123xxx  showed no changes from wt

mallinckrodt baker (phillipsburg, nj).
site-directed mutagenesis in the ␣1a-ar—site-directed mutagenesis
of the pmt2⬘ rat ␣1a-ar plasmid (14) was performed using polymerase
chain reaction technology and commercially synthesized oligonucleotides (life technologies, inc.) specifically designed to code for the desired mutation. a fragment of cdna encoding either the f312a or
f312n mutation of the rat ␣1a-ar was generated using sense primers
containing the unique ecori cloning site before the start site of translation and an antisense primer targeted to the unique ahaiii site of the
rat ␣1a-ar that also encoded the mutation. the f308a or f308l mutations were generated using a sense primer containing the mutation
targeted to the endogenous msei restriction site and an antisense
primer containing the noti restriction site after the stop codon. using
the expand high fidelity polymerase chain reaction protocol (roche
molecular biochemicals), these specific fragments of the rat ␣1a-ar
were generated using 1 ␮g of pmt2⬘ rat ␣1a-ar plasmid, 300 nm sense
and antisense primers, 200 nm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and
2.6 units of taq and pwo dna polymerase in a 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5,
buffer containing 100 mm kcl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm edta,
0.05% (w/v) tween 20, and a final mgcl2 concentration of 1.5 mm. all
polymerase chain reactions were conducted in 10% (v/v) glycerol. the
amplification reactions, which were repeated for 40 cycles, consisted of
denaturation at 95 °c for 3 min and an annealing and elongation phase
at 72 °c for an additional 3 min. the polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments resulting from each of the reactions were isolated and
purified, followed by either ecori/ahaiii (phe-312 mutations) or maei/
noti (phe-308 mutations) restriction enzyme digestion. the polymerase
chain reaction products were ligated with their respective wt fragment
and subcloned into the pmt2⬘ expression vector to yield the full-length
rat ␣1a-ar construct containing single mutations. mutations were confirmed by full-length sequence analysis of the construct by the dideoxy
method (cleveland clinic sequencing core facility).
cell culture and transfection—cos-1 cells (american type culture
collection, manassas, va) were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v)
penicillin, and streptomycin. cells were maintained and passaged upon
reaching confluence by standard cell culture techniques. experiments
were conducted on cells between passages 10 and 25. cells were transiently transfected with either wild type or mutated ␣1a-ar subcloned
into eukaryotic expression plasmid pmt2⬘ using the deae-dextran
method as described previously (15).
membrane preparation—membranes were prepared as described
previously (6). briefly, transfected cos-1 cells were scraped 72 h after
transfection, collected, washed in hank’s  xxxd2988xxx , and
then pelleted under low-speed centrifugation. the cell pellet was resuspended in a 0.25 m sucrose solution and centrifuged. the pellet was
resuspended in water containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and
frozen at ⫺70 °c for 30 min. pellets were dounced from a b glass
dounce homogenizer. nuclear debris was removed by a low-speed centrifugation step. membranes in the supernatant were washed with
hem buffer and pelleted by high-speed centrifugation. the membrane
pellet was washed twice in hem buffer, and the final pellet was reconstituted in hem buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and stored at
⫺70 °c until use. the protein concentration was determined by a bradford assay, using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the known standard.
measurement of ligand binding affinities—saturation binding experiments to measure the affinity of 125i-heat at ␣1a-ars were performed as described previously (6). the binding affinities of various
adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists were determined in a
series of competition binding experiments performed as described previously (6). all binding assays were performed in duplicate in hem

discussion

␣1a-ar affinity;  xxxd123xxx  had a 36-fold increased affinity, but
only at the f308l mutation.
in agonist binding at the phe-308 mutations (table ii), all
phenethylamine-type agonists such as epinephrine, phenylephrine, and  xxxd2601xxx  displayed no changes in affinity from
the wt receptor. however, imidazoline-type agonists such as
oxymetazoline and clonidine displayed a 13-fold and a 4-fold
decrease in affinity from the wt, respectively.
binding phenotype at phe-312 mutations—binding results
for a series of ␣1-ar, ␣2-ar, and ␤-ar antagonists are presented in table i. in saturation binding studies, results of
phe-312 mutations were similar to those of the phe-308 mutations. the radiolabeled antagonist 125i-heat bound to each of
the mutated receptors with wild type ␣1a-ar affinity. receptor
density of the phe-312 substitutions was also similar to that of
the wt and the phe-308 mutations. ␣1-antagonist affinities
were decreased for  xxxd3000xxx  (85-fold), 5-methylurapidil (21fold), wb4101 (5-fold), and (⫹) niguldipine (1000-fold). these
changes were all at the f312a mutation, with only niguldipine
showing additional changes at the f312n mutation. affinities
for the ␣2-ar and ␤-ar antagonists were also unchanged from
the wt, as seen for the phe-308 mutations.
in agonist binding at the phe-312 mutations (table ii), the
results were similar to those of the phe-308 mutations in that
phenethylamine-type agonists such as epinephrine, phenylephrine, and  xxxd2601xxx  were unchanged from wt. again,
imidazoline-type agonists showed decreased affinity with

aromaticity/hydrophobicity has been shown to be important in
the binding of agonists and antagonists to the various subtypes of
adrenergic receptors. recently, we have identified two novel aromatic interactions promoting agonist binding that involve two
phenylalanine residues located at the extracellular surface of
tm4 and  xxxg2318xxx  of the ␣1a-ar (6). these residues were modeled to
form contacts from above the plane of the agonist pocket. until
recently, determination of residues involved in antagonist binding at ␣1-ars was limited to two domains. one is located on the
second extracellular loop of the receptor. these consecutive residues (gln-177, ile-178, and asn-179) are involved only in ␣1a-ar
versus ␣1b-ar selectivity issues and then for only three ligands,
 xxxd2914xxx , wb4101, and partial effects on 5-methylurapidil
(7). another group has shown that mutagenesis of a phenylalanine residue (f86m) at the surface of tm2 in the ␣1a-ar accounts
for the ␣1a versus ␣1d selectivity of dihydropyridine antagonists
such as niguldipine (12). this aromatic residue is also modeled to
be in the first helical turn of tm2. nevertheless, both these
previous interactions involve selectivity issues and separate domains of the receptor and involved only certain antagonists. a
major antagonist docking site has never been reported in any
adrenergic receptor family member, let alone any g proteincoupled receptor; thus, it has been thought that these ligands are
very diverse in their binding parameters because of the diversity
of their chemical structures.
aromaticity/hydrophobicity should be more important in antagonist binding than in agonist binding, given the higher
degree of these contacts contained in adrenergic antagonists
and their decreased aqueous solubility. agonists typically have
one aromatic ring and hydrophilic substitutents, whereas
␣1-ar antagonists are larger molecules with multiple aromatic/
hydrophobic ring components. however, little is known of specific residues involved in antagonist binding, even among other
adrenergic receptor family members. chimeras between the ␤1and ␤2-ar failed to reveal discrete residues (18, 19). however,
a single residue in tm7 (either phe-412 in the ␣2 or asn-385 in
the 5-ht1a) seemed responsible for certain ␤-ar antagonist
selectivity (11, 20). therefore, to explore additional residues
involved in antagonist binding, we postulated that in addition
to the antagonist pocket being closer to the extracellular surface than agonists, the pocket must also be skewed but sufficient in overlap to maintain competitive interactions. because
we and others have found agonist interactions in  xxxg2318xxx  through
tm6 for the ␣1-ar (4 – 6, 13, 21) and an antagonist-binding
residue in tm7 in ␣2-/␤2-ars (11) and in tm6 for a few ␣1antagonists (6), the antagonist pocket must also be skewed
toward tm6 and tm7. we therefore focused our attention on
tm7 of the ␣1-ar for mutagenesis studies.
as shown in the sequence alignment (fig. 1), the phenylalanine residue at position 308 of the ␣1a-ar is conserved across
all the cloned adrenergic receptor subtypes except the ␤2-ar,
where the aromaticity is conserved as a tyrosine residue. two
mutations of this residue were made: (a) a f308a mutation in
which the side chain packing and the potential for van der
waal’s interactions were minimized, and (b) a f308l mutation
in which the aromaticity of the side chain was removed, but
hydrophobicity was maintained. the phenylalanine at position
312 was mutated in expectation of cross-family selectivity issues such as those found in the ␣2-ar, ␤2-ar, and 5-ht1a
receptors (11, 20). therefore, to reproduce this same system, we
mutated phe-312 to asn, the same corresponding residue found
in the ␤-ars and the 5-ht1a. this mutation would also test
hydrophobicity. we also made the f312a substitution to ex-

plore potential packing interactions.
mutation of either phe-308 or phe-312 did not change the
affinity of 125i-heat, the radiolabeled antagonist (table i).
this supports the position that the overall global conformation
of the receptor was maintained, and the changes in affinity we
do see with other ligands are specific. likewise, there are no
significant differences in receptor expression as measured by
changes in bmax. interestingly, there are no published reports
of any residue that specifically changes the affinity of 125iheat, which leads to speculation regarding how this antagonist actually binds in the pocket to accommodate this larger
iodinated species. inclusive of this report, all ␣1-antagonists
except for 125i-heat had at least one point binding contact
identified in the receptor. nevertheless, because mutation of
either 308 or 312 does produce specific affinity changes, but
only in antagonists and imidazolines, it is reasonable that the
mutations are involved in direct contacts and not in global or
nonspecific changes in receptor structure.
neither residue changed the affinity of the endogenous agonist, epinephrine, or of other phenethylamine-type agonists
such as phenylephrine or  xxxd2601xxx , suggesting that the
changes in affinity were antagonist-specific (table ii). in ␣1antagonist binding, either phe-308 or phe-312 substitutions or
sometimes both residues displayed lower binding affinities for
all ␣1-ar antagonists tested; the only exception was  xxxd2914xxx  (table i). the degree of change varied (3–1200-fold), but
this is likely due to the variances in structure. both  xxxd3000xxx 

(85-fold) and niguldipine (1200-fold) had the greatest decrease
in affinity, which coincidently correlates to these ligands having the highest binding affinities for ␣1-ars (subnanomolar). it
is likely that phe-308 is involved in mostly aromatic binding
because both the ala and leu substitutions resulted in roughly
equal losses in affinity. in contrast, it appears that phe-312 is
most likely involved in packing interactions because most of
the changes in affinity were at the ala substitution and not at
the asn substitution.
in modeling these interactions and using the current coordinates of rhodopsin (16), the binding orientation of wb4101 is
illustrated in fig. 3a. this model incorporates the residues
involved in subtype-selective affinity changes in wb4101 (30fold) that we described previously that are located in the second
extracellular loop (7). according to the structure of rhodopsin,
the second extracellular loop folds down into the binding pocket
of retinal and likewise in our model folds down sufficiently to
allow interactions with wb4101. the portion of the loop near
 xxxg2318xxx  was previously found to contain charged interactions with
wb4101, and thus these moities are orientated toward the
charged portions of the antagonist. the extracellular loop interactions still allow aromatic interactions with phe-308 and
phe-312 that are likely due to the phenyl ring. this docking of
wb4101 is consistent with its placement above the plane of the
agonist pocket (note the orientation of ser-188 and ser-192,
which are involved in phenethylamine agonist binding, (4)).

antagonist binding at ␣1-adrenergic receptors

interaction. although it may be argued that propranolol contains an extra aromatic ring and may pack differently in the
pocket with phe-308, these results utilizing ␤- and ␣2-antagonists merely emphasize that there are significant differences in
the binding pockets among adrenergic family members, although they may conserve key residues.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that two phe residues
in tm7 are involved in high-affinity binding for a large number
of ␣1-antagonists. these interactions are not involved in subtype selectivity differences because both phe residues are
strictly conserved among all three ␣1-ar subtypes but represent a major docking site for ␣1-ar antagonists. imidazoline
agonists, which were recognized previously to bind differently
than epinephrine-like agonists, also bind to these two phe
residues in tm7, suggesting that imidazolines bind with some
antagonist characteristics. this antagonist-like binding may
explain their generally poorer agonism at ␣1-ars. a consensus
of the results of numerous mutagenesis studies suggests that
the agonist pocket lies deeper in the hydrophobic core of the
receptor and involves tms 3 through 6, whereas antagonist
binding is located above the plane of agonist binding but is
skewed toward tm7. this study represents the first report of a
major docking site for ␣1-ar antagonists and for a g proteincoupled receptor in general. these studies suggest that
whereas antagonists generally have diverse structures, there
are conserved pharmacophores that recognize a common site on
the receptor. these studies may be helpful in the synthesis of
selective ligands for these receptors and may represent conserved paradigms for antagonist binding in other adrenergic
receptors or other nonpeptide g protein-coupled receptors.

still possible but would be a weak interaction due to a greater
separation than agonist binding. however, this result is consistent with previous mutagenesis of asp-125 in the ␣1b-ar, in
which antagonist binding was not affected as greatly as agonist
binding (5). modeling of the other antagonists produced similar
results, with one end of the molecule interacting with phe-308
and phe-312, whereas the other end was orientated more toward tm6 than tm4 –5.
the model is also consistent with the reason why  xxxd2914xxx  did not change affinity with either tm7 mutation. all of the
ligands that changed affinity in this report have long and extended structures, whereas  xxxd2914xxx  is more compact and is
likely confined to  xxxg2318xxx – 6 and the loop regions and not extended
to tm7. consistent with this interpretation,  xxxd2914xxx  displayed an 8-fold loss of affinity at the second extracellular loop
mutations (7) and a 10-fold loss at the phe-310 mutation in tm6
(13) but did not do so with either tm7 mutation.
interestingly, we found that all imidazoline-type agonists
also decreased affinity with phe-308 and phe-312 substitutions. the affinity of oxymetazoline, a weak partial agonist,
was decreased at f308l (13-fold) and f312a (150-fold). decreases in affinity were also found for other imidazolines such
as  xxxd1707xxx  (8-fold) and clonidine (25-fold). imidazolines have
been proposed to bind differently in the agonist pocket than
phenethylamine agonists such as epinephrine because many
mutants that affect phenylethylamine binding do not change
imidazoline binding (6, 22). in fact, in earlier studies, the
eason-stedman hypothesis predicted that imidazolines bind
differently than phenethylamines (23). this is also supported
by signaling studies in which imidazolines lack cross-desensitization with phenethylamine agonists, suggesting different
activation and signaling parameters (24). because the imidazoline ring has protonated nitrogens that are involved in binding
to asp-106 in  xxxg2318xxx  and is required for agonism (5), modeling of
this ligand (fig. 3b) requires that the imidazoline ring must be
pointed toward  xxxg2318xxx , but the second aromatic ring analogous to
epinephrine must then orient toward tm7. this is in sharp
contrast to epinephrine binding, in which the aromatic ring is
orientated toward  xxxg2318xxx  (4). therefore, the binding of imidazolines is also skewed toward tm7 and located higher in the
pocket, much like antagonist binding. mutation of phe-412 to
asn (analogous to phe-312 in the ␣1a-ar) in tm7 of the ␣2-ar
also resulted in lower binding affinity for  xxxd201xxx ,
another imidazoline agonist (11), suggesting perhaps a conserved binding paradigm for imidazolines in both ␣1- and ␣2ars. however, our current results suggest that they also have
some antagonist-like binding character due to their involvement of tm7, which may orient imidazolines differently than
phenethylamines and account for their generally poor agonism
at ␣1-ars (25).
interestingly, mutation of phe-312 to asn in the ␣1a-ar in
mimicry of the ␣2-/␤2-ar or 5-ht1a studies (11, 20) did not
display any changes in affinity for ␤-ar antagonists ( xxxd123xxx 
and propranolol) or the ␣2-ar antagonist (yohimbine) (table i).
although asn is believed to be involved in a high-affinity point
contact for propranolol and  xxxd123xxx  and other aryloxyalkylamine ␤-ar antagonists (20) and is possibly discriminatory
between ␣2- and ␤-ar antagonists (11) due to losses in yohimbine binding, it does not appear that the corresponding residue
(phe-312) in the ␣1-ar is involved in analogous paradigms.
however, f308l in the ␣1a-ar displayed altered non-␣1-ar
binding only for  xxxd123xxx  (36-fold higher affinity) and could
not reproduce it with propranolol. it is possible for the propyl
group of  xxxd123xxx  to pack with phe-308, and perhaps the
extended structure of the leucine substitution enhances this
