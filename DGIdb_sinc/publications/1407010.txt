summary. radioligand binding studies were performed
in membranes of rabbit whole brain and striatum using
the novel iodinated radioligand for 5-hydroxytryptamine
5-htab and 5-htid sites, serotonin-5-o-carboxymethyl-glycyl[125i]tyrosinamide ([125i]gti).
[125i]gti labelled a finite number of high affinity sites
in rabbit brain membranes, bma x = 191 _+_47 fmol/mg
protein, pkd (-log mol/1)= 8.50+0.13, n = 5. the
pharmacological profile of [125i]gti binding was fully
comparable to that reported previously in human and
other brain preparations known to possess 5-htm sites
(using either [3h]5-ht or [~25i]gti) and displayed a
characteristic rank order of affinity: 5-carboxamidotryptamine > 5-ht = dihydroergotamine _> ergotamine
_> sumatriptan > cgs 12066 _> metergoline > yohimbine >  xxxd2621xxx  > icyp > 8-oh-dpat > cp
93129 > (-) xxxd2957xxx  >  xxxd2419xxx  > isamoltane >
mesulergine > corynanthine > buspirone > mdl
72222.
autoradiographic studies were performed on rabbit
brain slices using [3h]5-ht in the presence of 100 nmol/1
8-oh-dpat and mesulergine (in order to mask 5 - h t 1 a
and 5-htlc binding sites) and [azsi]cyp (iodocyanopindolol) in the presence of 3 gmol/1  xxxd2398xxx  and
100nmol/1 8-oh-dpat (in order to mask /?
adrenoceptor and 5-htaa binding sites). there was no
detectable specific binding of [125i]cyp through the
brain, thus excluding the presence of 5-ht~b sites in
rabbit brain. by contrast, [3h]5-ht labelled a high density of sites in globus pallidus, substantia nigra and superior colliculus. other regions displaying labelling include the striatum, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
and the periaqueductal grey matter. this pattern of distribution is compatible with that reported for 5-htm sites
in other species.
the present data strongly suggest that rabbit brain
has recognition sites with the pharmacological profile
and distribution characteristic of the 5-ht~d recognition
site. these findings are in agreement with results obtained
correspondence to d. hoyer at the above address

by limberger et al. 0991), suggesting the terminal 5-ht
autoreceptor of the rabbit brain to belong to the 5-htid
subtype. except for limited species variations (see
bruinvels et al. 1992), the pharmacology of these sites
does not justify an addition to the existing nomenclature
("5-htar"), in contrast to what has been proposed by
xiong and nelson (1989). the rabbit represents another
laboratory species in which 5-ht~d receptor mediated
effects could be studied.

introduction
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) 5-ht~ receptors
are currently subdivided into 5-htxa, 5-ht1b, 5-ht~c
and 5-htlo (hoyer et al. 1985b; heuring and peroutka
1987). these subdivisions, however, have a pharmacological basis (see bradley et al. 1986) and it appears that
based on the sequence of cloned receptors, a clarification
can be proposed. indeed, the 5-htac receptor clearly
belongs of the subfamily of 5-ht2 receptors, if one considers the very close structural homology of 5-ht~c and
5-ht2 receptors (julius et al. 1988; pritchett et al. 1988;
hartig 1989) as already suggested on other grounds
(hoyer 1988). the subdivision of 5-ht1b/5-ht~d receptor also requires clarification. indeed, 5-ht~b receptors
as they are pharmacologically characterised have only
been described in rat, mouse, hamster and opossum
(hoyer et al. 1985a; waeber et al. 1990; seuwen et al.
1988; murphy and bylund 1989). the presence of 5-htib
sites could not be detected in the brain of pig, man or
other species (hoyer et al. 1985b, 1986a; heuring and
peroutka 1987; waeber et al. 1990). however, a new site,
termed 5-ht~d was described initially in bovine brain
(heuring and peroutka 1987) and subsequently in other
species including human brain (hoyer et al. 1988; waeber

250
et al. 1988a, 1988b, 1990). although different as far as
their pharmacological characteristics are concerned,
5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors have similar distributions,
second messenger coupling and other functional features;
it was suggested that they represent species variants and
are the product of related genes (see hoyer and
middlemiss 1989). recent cloning work seems to confirm
this hypothesis (see hartig et al. 1992 for discussion).
the main problem with 5-ht~d recognition sites, lies
in the complex nature of 5 - h t m binding as it was initially
defined: 5-htio binding studies using [3h]5-ht as a
radioligand (in the presence of an excess of 8-oh-dpat
(8-hydroxydi-n,n-propyl-aminotetralin) and mesulergine in order to block 5-ht~a and 5-ht~c sites, respectively), resulted in complex competition curves with compounds such as 5-ct (5-carboxamidotryptamine) and
g r 43175 (sumatriptan) (waeber et al. 1988b;
leonhardt et al. 1989; sumner and humphrey 1989).
these findings led leonhardt et al. (1989) to propose the
existence of the 5-hti~ receptor. further, xiong and
nelson (1989), suggested that in the rabbit caudate (where
5-ht1b or  xxxg1110xxx  would be expected), a "5-httr"
receptor/binding site is present. the pharmacology of this
"new" site was characterised with only a limited number
of compounds: among those, spiperone and a few other
drugs were apparently more potent in rabbit as compared
to calf caudate membranes.
there are presently no functional correlates for the
5-ht~e or 5-ht~r sites, but the apparent heterogeneity
of the 5-ht ~o sites has generated some controversy about
the use of [3h]5-ht as a suitable radioligand for identifying these sites. by using the novel iodinated radioligand
serotonin- 5-o- carboxymethyl-glycyl[125i]tyrosinamide
(segu et al. 1991; boulenguez et al. 1991a, 1991b, 1992)
(abbreviated [125i]gti for the sake of simplicity), we
have provided evidence for the presence of a homogeneous population of recognition sites with the pharmacological profile of the 5-ht~d site in the human substantia nigra and other tissues (bruinvels et al. 1991,
1992); we decided to make use of this ligand to characterise the pharmacological profile o f the sites labelled with
[12si]gti in rabbit brain. further, results from
autoradiographic studies performed, in order to localise
the distribution of non-5-ht~a/non 5-htm sites in rabbit brain, are presented. the aim of the study was to
clarify the situation created by the report on 5 - h t ~
receptors in rabbit brain (xiong and nelson 1989).
materials and methods

radioligand binding studies. new zealand rabbits (2-3 kg) were
killed by a blow to the neck and the brain was removed rapidly.
membranes of rabbit striatum or whole brain (without cerebellum)
were prepared as described earlier (waeber et al. 1988b). membranes (150 gl, final dilution 1 g of fresh tissue in 20 ml) were incubated at 37°c for 30 min with 50 lal competing drug or buffer and
5091 [125i]gti (20pmol/1 in competition experiments or
8 concentrations in saturation studies). the incubation buffer
contained 50 retool/1 tris hc1 (ph 7.7) and 4 mmol/1 cac12. incubation was terminated by rapid filtration as previously described
(waeber et al. 1988b). nonspecific binding was determined in the
presence of 10 gmol/1 5-ht. competition and saturation exper-

iments were analysed by computerized nonlinear regression as described earlier (waeber et al. 1988b). the data are expressed as
pkd values (-log tool/l). protein concentrations were determined
according to bradford (1976).
autoradiographic studies. rabbits were killed by an overdose of
phenobarbital, the skull opened, the brain removed and placed
on dry ice. ten micrometer thick tissue sections were cut with a
microtome cryostat, thaw mounted onto gelatinised microscope
slides and stored at -20°c until used. the incubations were
performed as follows: after 30 rain preincubation in 170 mmol/1tris
hc1 (ph 7.4, containing 4 mmol/1 cac12), slides were incubated for
1 h ([3h]5-ht)or 2 h ([lzsi]cyp) at room temperature in the same
buffer containing 0.01%  xxxd228xxx , 10 gmol/1  xxxd2850xxx  and
either 2 nmol/1 [3h]5-ht or 70 pmol/1 [125i]cyp. specific [3h]5ht binding was defined in the presence of 100 nmol/1 8-oh-dpat
and mesulergine (in order to block 5-ht1a and 5-htlc binding),
whereas specific [125i]cyp binding was performed in the presence
of 3 i.tmol/1isoprenaline and 100 nmol/1 8-oh-dpat (to block fladrenoceptors and 5-ht1a receptors). non specific binding was
defined in the presence of 10 gmol/1 5-ht. slides were then washed
in preincubation buffer at 4° c, after a brief dip followed by a 5-min
wash ([ah]5-ht) or two 15-min washes ([lzsi]cyp). after a final
dip in distilled water, the sections were quickly dried in cold air.
autoradiograms were generated by apposing the labelled sections
to [3h]-hyperfilm (amersham) along with tritiated or iodinated
standards. films were developed after 8 h ([125i]cyp) or 2 months
([3h]5-ht) and quantified with a computerised image analysis system as described (waeber et al. 1988a).
drugs. drugs were obtained from the following sources: isamoltane

netherlands); mdl 72222, leh,3e,5eh-tropan-3-yl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate malonate, (merrel-dow, strasbourg, france); corynanthine (karl roth kg, karlsruhe, frg); 8-oh-dpat, 8hydroxy-2[di-n-propylamino]tetralin hbr and cgs 12066 maleate
(research biochemicals inc, wayland, mass., usa); ipsapirone
hc1 (tropon werke, k61n, frg); buspirone hc1 (bristol myers
squibb, mead johnson, evansville, ind., usa); metergoline
(farmitalia, milan, italy). following compounds were synthesised
at sandoz pharma: mesulergine hc1,  xxxd3263xxx ,
dihydroergotamine methane sulfonate (dhe),  xxxd2022xxx ,
 xxxd2621xxx  maleate, (-) xxxd2957xxx , 2-iodo-cyanopindolol (icyp),
sdz 21-009 4[ter-butyl-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy]indol-2-carbonic-acid-isopropyl-ester) and 5-ct (5-carboxamidotryptamine
maleate). [3h]5-ht was from dupont-nen (dreieich, frg),
[125i]cyp from amersham (u.k.), and [lzsi]gti was from
immunotech (marseille, france) or custom synthesised at anawa
(wangen, switzerland).

results

in preliminary experiments, drugs displayed similar affinity values in striatum and whole brain membranes, thus
the latter were used for the rest of the study and the data
pooled. [125i]gti labelled high affinity recognition sites
in rabbit brain: bmax = 191 _ 47 fmol/mg protein, pkd
(-log tool/l) = 8.50 + 0.13 (n = 5). competition experiments revealed that most of the compounds displaced

the radioligand in a monophasic fashion (see fig. 1).
when a low affinity component was apparent, it was
minimal and represented merely displacement of nonspecific binding. the high affinity component of the sites
labelled with [tzsi]gti displayed the following rank order of affinity (see table 1): 5-carboxamidotryptamine

rank order of affinity of the drugs tested was in good
agreement with affinity values determined previously in
binding studies performed with either [125i]gti (fig. 2)
or [3h]5-ht in brain membranes of various species (see
waeber et al. 1990; bruinvels et al. 1991, 1992) and their
potency to inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase
in calf substantia nigra (schoeffter et al. 1988; waeber et
al. 1990).
autoradiographic studies in rabbit brain revealed that
[125i]cyp showed no specific 5-ht binding. in contrast,
[ah]5-ht under so-called  xxxg1110xxx  conditions labelled a
high density of sites in the nigrostriato-nigral axis (see
fig. 3), especially in globus pallidus, substantia nigra and
superior colliculus. other regions displaying labelling include the striatum, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
and the periaqueductal gray matter. this distribution is

discussion
in the present study we have characterised using binding
and autoradiographic studies, the pharmacology and distribution of non 5-ht1a, non 5-htlc sites in rabbit brain,

252

253
with radioligands known to bind to 5-ht1b and 5-ht~d
receptors.
[a25i]gti labelled high affinity sites in rabbit brain
with a rank order of affinity comparable to that of
5-htid sites labelled with this radioligand (bruinvels et
al. 1991, 1992) or with [3h]5-ht in a variety of other
species (waeber et al. 1988 b, 1990). as noted previously
(bruinvels et al. 1991), the comparison of the affinity
values obtained with [~25i]gti and those of the 5-htio
binding data using [3h]5-ht as a radioligand, reveals
that the tested compounds show a somewhat higher affinity for the [125i]gti binding sites: this is probably due
to the fact that affinity values determined with [3h]5-ht
represent a composite of high and low affinity binding
which therefore picture an underestimation.
the results from autoradiographic studies are als0
consistent with the presence of 5-htad sites in rabbit
brain: the distribution of the site was fully comparable
with that reported previously for 5 - h t m sites in a variety
of species (waeber et al. 1990; segu et al. 1991;
boulenguez et al. 1992). furthermore, there was no evidence for the presence of 5-htib sites in rabbit brain.
the present data strongly suggest the presence of
5 - h t m binding sites in rabbit brain. we have no evidence
for calling these binding sites otherwise than 5-ht~d in
contrast to what has been proposed by xiong and nelson
(1989). the slight variations which may be observed (with
e.g. spiperone, see table 2), can be explained by specific
differences (see also adjacent paper). species variations
do exist: we have previously reported that rat brain
 xxxg1113xxx  are different from pig or human brain
5-ht2 receptors (pazos et al. 1984; hoyer et al. 1986b).
several compounds, especially mesulergine, showed significantly less affinity for the latter two receptors. this
has been confirmed by hartig and collaborators (1990)
using cells transfected with human 5-ht2 receptors: in
these cells, mesulergine had ~/n affinity (pkd 6.96) which

fig. 3. autoradiograms were generated with sections from rabbit
brain at the level of the forbrain (nucleus lentiformis) (a-d) and
of the mesencephalon (e, f). sections were labelled as described in
materials and methods using [3h]5-ht (in the presence of
100 nmol/1 8-oh-dpat and mesulergine; a top left, b top right, e
bottom left, f bottom right) or [125i]cyp(in the presence of 3 gmol/1
 xxxd2401xxx  and 100 nmol/1 8-oh-dpat; c middle left, d middle
right). in the presence of 5-ht1a/5-htlc receptor blocking drugs,
[3h]5-ht labelling is particularly dense in the globus pallidus (gp)
and ventral pallidum (vp). the caudate (cd), putamen (put) and
hippocampal formation (hp) also exhibit high densities of binding
sites, while intermediate densities of sites are detected in the cortex
(cx). at the midbrain level (e), densest labelling is found in the
substantia nigra (sn) and the subiculum (sub), intermediate concentrations of sites being observed in the superficial grey layer of the
superior colliculus (sgl), dentate gyrus (dg) and the central grey
(cg). in all areas of the rabbit brain, non specific binding (b, f),
defined in the presence of 10 gmol/1 5-ht, is homogeneous and
not significantly different from background. in the presence of
 xxxd2398xxx  and 8-oh-dpat, no specific [~2si]cyp binding can
be detected in the rabbit brain. the labelling observed in the
hippocampal formation, cortex and primary olfactory cortex (po)
(panels c and d) is not displaceable by 10 pmol/1 5-ht. scale bars
are 5 mm

.is much lower than the value found in rat tissue (pkd
8.30). it seems also that 5-ht3 receptors present large
species variations in their pharmacological profile (hoyer
1990). however, such features are not sufficient to justify
a new addition to the existing nomenclature. the present
data are also supported by the recent publication of limberger et al. (1991), who characterised the rabbit terminal
5-ht autoreceptor as  xxxg1110xxx  as suggested (hoyer and
middlemiss 1989). thus, the rabbit represents another
laboratory animal in which 5 - h t m receptor-mediated
effects can be studied.
it is unclear at present which type(s) of 5-htlo site
is labelled in rabbit brain; indeed, at least two human
receptors with nearly identical 5 - h t m pharmacology
have been cloned (see hamblin and metcalf 1991;
branchek et al. 1991 and for discussion adham et al.
1992; hartig et al. 1992). however, based on the fact that
[12si]gti labels 5-ht1b sites in rat brain tissues and
5-httd sites in brain membranes o f other species with
similar distributions (segu et al. 1991; boulenguez et al.
1992; palacios et al. 1992) one could speculate that the
rabbit equivalent of the 5-ht~dp clone (according to the
nomenclature of hartig et al. 1992) is the target. this
point will be clarified using molecular probes, since at
present no ligand has been reported to discriminate the
products of the two human clones.
