 xxxd3234xxx  deficiency resulting from targeted disruption of the  xxxg2181xxx  gene in embryonic stem cells leads to enhanced sensitivity to antip...  polyamines are known to be essential for normal cell growth and differentiation. however, despite numerous studies, specific cellular functions of polyamines in general and individual polyamines in particular have remained only tentative, because of a lack of appropriate cell lines in which genes of polyamine-synthesizing enzymes have been disrupted by gene targeting. with the use of homologous recombination technique, we disrupted the gene encoding  xxxg2181xxx  in mouse embryonic stem cells. the  xxxg2181xxx  gene is located on x chromosome in mouse and, because the cells used in this study were of xy karyotype, a single targeting event was sufficient to result in null genotype. the targeted cells did not have any measurable  xxxg2181xxx  activity and were totally devoid of the polyamine  xxxd3234xxx .  xxxd3234xxx  deficiency led to a substantial increase in spermidine content, but the total polyamine content was nearly unchanged. despite the lack of  xxxd3234xxx , these cells displayed a growth rate that was nearly similar to that of the parental cells and showed no overt morphological changes. however, the  xxxd3234xxx -deficient cells were significantly more sensitive to the growth inhibition exerted by 2- xxxd2430xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg1626xxx . similarly, methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), an inhibitor of  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase, and diethylnorspermine, a polyamine analog, although exerting cytostatic growth inhibition on wild-type cells, were clearly cytotoxic to the  xxxd3234xxx -deficient cells. the  xxxd3234xxx -deficient cells were also much more sensitive to etoposide-induced dna damage than their wild-type counterparts.
