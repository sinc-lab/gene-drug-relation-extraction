abstract
▲  xxxd52xxx  ( xxxd52xxx ®)1 is the first in a new class of biologics
known as selective costimulation modulators. it inhibits full activation of t cells and interacts with other cell types to affect
additional mediators of the inflammatory cascade.
▲ the clinical efficacy of  xxxd52xxx  in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, despite prior treatment with methotrexate or antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti- xxxg2296xxx ) therapies, has been investigated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase iii trials of 6 or 12 months’ duration. in these trials,
patients received intravenous  xxxd52xxx  (fixed-dose regimen based
on bodyweight) or placebo in addition to background diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) other than anti- xxxg2296xxx 
therapies.
▲ relative to placebo,  xxxd52xxx  significantly improved signs and
symptoms of disease assessed using american college of rheumatology (acr) 20, 50, and 70 criteria and specific improvement
in physical function as measured by the health assessment questionnaire disability index at 6 months and significantly slowed
structural damage progression in joints at 12 months. improvements in acr 20, 50, and 70 response rates were maintained at the
final assessment in the 12-month trial.
▲  xxxd52xxx  infusions were generally well tolerated. acute infusionrelated reactions occurred in 9% of  xxxd52xxx  and 6% of placebo
recipients in phase iii trials. integrated safety data from five
clinical trials showed that serious adverse events were reported in
13.6% of  xxxd52xxx  and 12.3% of placebo recipients and the
incidence of serious infections was 3.0% and 1.9%.  xxxd52xxx 
administered with background biologic dmards appears to be
less well tolerated than  xxxd52xxx  plus background nonbiologic
dmards.

rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized
by progressive joint destruction, deformity, and disability, and
impaired health-related quality of life (hr-qol).[1] goals of
treating rheumatoid arthritis include preventing or controlling joint
damage, preventing loss of function, managing pain, and improving overall hr-qol.[1] treatment options include nsaids, corticosteroids (either local or systemic), ‘traditional’ nonbiologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards), and the more
recently introduced biologic dmards.[1]
nsaids do not alter the course of the disease or prevent joint
destruction and are rarely used alone, except in very mild disease.[1] nonbiologic dmards, such as methotrexate (the standard
drug against which other dmards are evaluated),  xxxd3255xxx ,
azathioprine, d- xxxd2870xxx , gold salts, or cyclosporine, potentially reduce or prevent joint damage, particularly if used early.[1,2]
low-dose systemic corticosteroids may also slow the rate of joint
damage, thus demonstrating some disease-modifying potential.[1]
however, in the long term, patients treated with nonbiologic
dmards (including methotrexate) show deterioration in radiographs and joint function, indicating the need for improved
therapies.[3] biologic dmards (e.g. the anti- xxxg2296xxx  [anti- xxxg2296xxx ] therapies etanercept, infliximab, and
adalimumab and the recombinant human interleukin [il]-1 receptor antagonist [ril-1ra] anakinra) in combination with methotrexate have shown improved efficacy compared with methotrexate
alone in clinical trials.[4-7] nevertheless, a proportion of patients do
not respond to these therapies.[8] consequently, alternative treatment strategies are still required for patients with moderately to
severely active disease refractory to other therapies.
 xxxd52xxx , the first in a new class of agents known as the
selective costimulation modulators, may be of benefit in this group
of patients.[9] it is a genetically engineered fusion protein of the
extracellular domain of human  xxxg544xxx  and a fragment of the fc
region of human igg1 that has been modified to prevent complement fixation.[8] unlike the currently available biologic dmards,
which neutralize the effects of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines ( xxxg2296xxx  or il-1) that are involved in the joint destruction
process,[5,7]  xxxd52xxx  appears to work by specifically inhibiting
full activation of t cells, thereby downregulating the resultant
immune effector mechanisms, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines, autoantibodies, and joint eroding-enzymes (section 1).[8] this article reviews the pharmacologic
properties, efficacy, and tolerability of  xxxd52xxx  in the treatment
of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

1. pharmacodynamic profile
in vitro studies

although the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis is not
completely understood, it is likely that t-cell activation by unidentified arthritogenic antigens associated with major histocompatibility complex class ii is the first step in the development of the
disease.[8] activated t cells are thought to then initiate and maintain macrophage and b-cell activation and the production of the
pro-inflammatory cytokines, autoantibodies, and joint erodingenzymes involved in joint inflammation and destruction.[8]
● signals through several costimulation pathways between the t
cell and the antigen-presenting cell (apc) are associated with the
upregulation or downregulation of t-cell activation, including that
between cd28 on the t cell and the  xxxg396xxx  ( xxxg396xxx ) or  xxxg398xxx  ( xxxg398xxx )
ligands on the apc. endogenous  xxxg544xxx  has a higher avidity for
the  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  ( xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx ) ligands on the apc than cd28; this
competitive binding interrupts the costimulatory interaction between cd28 and  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  ( xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx ) that is essential for full
t-cell activation and subsequent proliferation.[8]
●  xxxd52xxx  also has a higher binding affinity for  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx 
(b7) ligands on the apc than cd28. consequently, it selectively
modulates t-cell costimulation by competitively inhibiting the
cd28 :  xxxg396xxx /86 ( xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx ) costimulatory interaction, thus
preventing the activation of t cells.[8]
● in in vitro studies in a human mixed lymphocyte reaction, the
proliferation of t cells stimulated with human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells,[10] b cells,[10,11] or dendritic cells[11] as apcs
was inhibited by  xxxd52xxx  at concentrations ≥3.16 mug/ml in one
study[10] and >0.3 mug/ml in another.[11] in the first study,[10]
increasing the  xxxd52xxx  concentrations from 3.2 mug/ml to 100.0
mug/ml did not provide additional t-cell inhibition. at an
 xxxd52xxx  concentration of 30 mug/ml in the second study, a maximum inhibition of t-cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (il-2,  xxxg2296xxx , interferon-gamma) was observed.[11]
● in an in vitro study involving the co-culture of rheumatoid
arthritis patient-derived synovial cells and autologous t cells,
 xxxd52xxx  inhibited the production of  xxxg1170xxx , il-6, and the proteolytic enzyme matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-3.[12]
●  xxxd52xxx  had no effect in vitro on  xxxg2296xxx  production from
stimulated monocytes, an important innate immune response.[11]

cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts) has been investigated in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with
methotrexate or anti- xxxg2296xxx  agents (reported as abstracts and posters).[13,14] a variety of biomarkers were measured during the
phase ii dose-finding trial[15,16] and the phase iii attain
( xxxd52xxx  trial in the treatment of anti-tnf inadequate responders)[17] and aim ( xxxd52xxx  in inadequate responders to
methotrexate)[18-23] trials discussed in more detail in section 3.
results from all three analyses were similar.[13,14] in both phase iii
trials  xxxd52xxx  (see section 3 for dosage details) or placebo was
administered in combination with background methotrexate or
other dmards (excluding anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapies).[17-23]
between five and eight of the following biomarkers were
measured:  xxxg520xxx  (crp) [inflammatory biomarker]
and rheumatoid factor (rf) [autoantibody]; sil-2r (soluble il-2
receptor [t-cell activation marker]);  xxxg2296xxx  and il-6 (pro-inflammatory cytokines); the adhesion molecules soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sicam-1) and  xxxg2048xxx  (markers of
endothelial cell activation);  xxxg1437xxx  (proteolytic enzyme produced
by various cells in the rheumatoid synovium).[13,14]
●  xxxd52xxx  reduced serum levels of most inflammatory mediators and markers to a greater extent than placebo.[13] for example,
in the aim trial, serum levels of sil-2r, il-6, and  xxxg1437xxx  were
significantly reduced with  xxxd52xxx  compared with placebo at
both the 6- and 12-month assessments (all p < 0.001 vs placebo).[13] serum levels of other markers ( xxxg2048xxx , rf, sicam-1,
and  xxxg2296xxx ), while numerically lower in the  xxxd52xxx  arm, were
not statistically different.[13]
● likewise, after 6 months’ treatment with  xxxd52xxx  or placebo
in the attain trial, serum levels of six of the seven markers
measured were significantly reduced with  xxxd52xxx  (sil-2r, il-6,
 xxxg1437xxx  [all p < 0.0001 vs placebo];  xxxg2048xxx , rf,  xxxg2296xxx  [all p <
0.05 vs placebo]); only sicam-1 was not reduced.[13]
2. pharmacokinetic profile
dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were observed in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis receiving multiple intravenous infusions
of  xxxd52xxx  2 or 10 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 30, and monthly
thereafter.[24] in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg dosage, the mean
volume of distribution was 0.07 l/kg (range 0.02–0.13 l/kg).
● at steady state, which appears to be achieved by day 60, the
mean maximum concentration after intravenous administration of
 xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg was 295 mug/ml (range 175–427 mug/ml) and
mean trough concentration (cmin) was 24 mug/ml (range 1–66 mug/
ml).[24] the mean steady-state cmin values of  xxxd52xxx  of approximately 22 mug/ml seen in a phase ii trial in patients receiving
background methotrexate plus  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg on days 1, 15,

and 30, and every 30 days thereafter were 7- to 10-fold higher than
that required to inhibit t-cell proliferation in vitro (3.16 mug/ml;
see section 1).[10]
● the mean terminal half-life after multiple intravenous infusions of  xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg was 13.1 days (range 8–25 days) and
systemic clearance was 0.22 ml/h/kg. systemic accumulation was
not apparent after repeated monthly administration.[24]
● population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated there was a
trend for increased clearance of  xxxd52xxx  with increasing
bodyweight; however, this has been overcome through the weightbased fixed-dosing regimen (section 5). neither age nor sex (after
adjusting for bodyweight) affected the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd52xxx .[24]
● the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd52xxx  have not been studied in
children and adolescents. no formal studies have been conducted
to examine the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd52xxx .[24]
●  xxxd52xxx  clearance was not affected by concomitant administration of commonly used dmards, including methotrexate,
nsaids, corticosteroids, or anti- xxxg2296xxx  agents.[24]
3. therapeutic efficacy

phase iii placebo-controlled trials

the clinical efficacy of intravenous  xxxd52xxx  for the treatment
of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with
dmards has been evaluated in the pivotal phase iii randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter attain[17,25] and
aim[18-23,26] trials. the fixed-dose regimen of intravenous
 xxxd52xxx  (which approximated a 10 mg/kg dose) was tiered
according to bodyweight: a 500mg dose on each of the treatment
days for patients weighing <60kg; 750mg for those weighing
60–100kg; 1000mg for those weighing >100kg.  xxxd52xxx  or
placebo was administered intravenously over 30 minutes on study
days 1, 15, and 29, and every 28 days for the remainder of the
study period.[17-23]
this dosage regimen was based on results of a 1-year, phase ii,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study
in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had shown an
inadequate response to methotrexate (n = 339).[15,16] in this study,
 xxxd52xxx  10 mg/kg administered with background methotrexate
(n = 115) was associated with consistently greater improvements
in signs and symptoms, physical function, and hr-qol than
 xxxd52xxx  2 mg/kg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 119) plus background
methotrexate after 6[16] or 12[15] months’ treatment and was at least
as well tolerated.
biodrugs 2006; 20 (1)

the 6-month attain trial randomized and treated 391 patients with an inadequate response to anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapy.[17] patients stopped anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapy at least 28 days (etanercept) or
60 days (infliximab) prior to randomization; at randomization,
patients were required to have been taking an oral dmard and/or
anakinra for at least 3 months, and to have been on a stable dose
for at least 28 days. patients were maintained on this background
medication throughout the trial, although dose modifications because of adverse events were permitted. the most frequently used
oral dmard was methotrexate (76% of  xxxd52xxx  and 82% of
placebo recipients).[17]
the 12-month aim trial randomized and treated 652 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to methotrexate.[18-23] for the first 6 months of the trial, methotrexate at a
minimum dosage of 10–15 mg/week was permitted;[22,26] the
methotrexate dosage could be modified or another nonbiologic
dmard added during the second 6 months.[20,26] throughout the
12-month study period, the mean dose of methotrexate was similar
in each treatment arm (≈15 mg/week) and did not increase; however, during the second six months of the trial, a nonbiologic
dmard was added for disease activity control in 14% of placebo
recipients (25 of 174 patients) and 4% of  xxxd52xxx  recipients (15
of 401 patients).[26]
the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the attain trial were
the percentage of patients achieving an american college of
rheumatology (acr) 20 response and the proportion of patients
achieving a clinically significant improvement (an improvement
of ≥0.3 units from baseline) in the health assessment questionnaire disability index (haq-di), assessed at 6 months.[17] secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients achieving improvements of 50% and 70% in acr criteria (acr 50 and acr
70) and improvements in the disease activity score (das)-28 (a
measure of changes in disease activity, including remission) at 6
months.
in the aim trial, the three co-primary endpoints were the
percentage of patients achieving an acr 20 response at 6 months,
the proportion of patients achieving a clinically significant improvement in the haq-di at 12 months and an assessment of
radiographic progression of structural damage using the genantmodified sharp score at 12 months.[20-22] secondary endpoints
included acr 50 and acr 70 response at 6 and 12 months,[21]
acr 20 response at 12 months[21] and improvements in the das28 at 6 and 12 months.[22]
in both trials, the concomitant use of stable dosages of low-dose
corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day prednisone or its equivalent) and
nsaids was also permitted.[17,26]

patients who met the acr criteria for rheumatoid arthritis and
had active disease characterized by ≥10 swollen joints, ≥12 tender
joints, and a crp level ≥1 mg/dl despite current treatment with
dmards were eligible for these trials.[17,22,23,26] those enrolled
had a mean age of 50–53 years, a mean duration of rheumatoid
arthritis of 9–12 years,[17,22] and were receiving a mean methotrexate dosage of 14.4–16.1 mg/week. mean das-28 values at trial
entry were ≈6.8, indicating high disease activity,[26] and mean crp
levels were 2.8–4.6 mg/dl.[17,22]
acr 20 is defined as a ≥20% reduction in the number of tender
or swollen joints plus a ≥20% response in at least three of the
following five criteria: patient’s global assessment of disease
activity, patient’s global assessment of pain, physician’s global
assessment of disease activity, patient’s assessment of physical
function using the haq-di, or crp level.[27] the haq-di measures physical function in eight domains (rising, dressing and
grooming, hygiene, reaching, gripping, walking, eating, other
activities) on a scale of 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do).[19] the
das-28 assesses 28 joints for swelling and tenderness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels, and patients’ global assessment of
disease activity; scores of >5.1, ≤3.2, and <2.6 indicate high
disease activity, low disease activity, and remission, respectively.
an improvement in haq-di of ≥0.3 was considered a clinically
meaningful improvement and a das-28 improvement of ≥1.2 is
considered to be evidence of a clinical response.[28]
both trials also measured improvement in hr-qol using the
validated 36-item short-form general health survey (sf36).[17,18] additional hr-qol measures such as fatigue and pain
were assessed using a visual analog scale and sleep quality was
assessed using the validated medical outcomes study sleep module (mos-sleep).[18,25] analyses of acr and haq-di responses
were based on the intent-to-treat (itt) population, with those who
discontinued for any reason considered to be nonresponders; itt
analyses for das-28 and sf-36 outcomes used an ancova,
with the last-observation-carried-forward method.[17-23]
most endpoint data from the attain trial are fully published.[17] efficacy results for pain and fatigue and sleep quality
measures[25] and a retrospective subgroup analysis from the attain trial[29] and efficacy data from the aim trial[18-23] are available as abstracts and/or posters.
in both pivotal studies, a significantly greater proportion of
patients treated with  xxxd52xxx  than placebo showed improvements
in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis according to acr
20 response criteria at 6 months (figure 1).[17,21,23] significant
differences in acr 20 response rates between  xxxd52xxx - and
placebo-treated patients occurred as early as 15 days following
treatment onset.[17,23]

39% of patients; p < 0.001).[22]

 xxxd52xxx  significantly slowed structural damage progression

● statistically significant acr 20 response rates at 12
months[21,23] and acr 50 and acr 70 response rates at 6[17,21,23]
and 12[21,23] months were also seen with  xxxd52xxx  compared with
placebo in both trials (all p ≤ 0.003 vs placebo). in addition, the
proportion of patients achieving a major or extended major clinical
response (an acr 70 response sustained over 6 [p < 0.001 vs

significantly greater with  xxxd52xxx  than placebo in the aim
trial.[23]
● higher rates of remission (proportion of patients with das-28
scores <2.6) were achieved at 6 months with  xxxd52xxx  than with
placebo in both trials (figure 1),[26] and significantly more
 xxxd52xxx  than placebo recipients had das-28 remission or low
disease activity at 12 months in the aim trial (both p < 0.001 vs
placebo).[22]
● a retrospective subgroup analysis of data from the attain
trial showed that, irrespective of disease duration prior to treatment (≤5 years or >5 years since diagnosis),  xxxd52xxx  improved
acr 20 response rates compared with placebo (p ≤ 0.007 for
either duration[30]). in those with a disease duration of >5 years,
 xxxd52xxx  also improved acr 50 (p < 0.001 vs placebo[30]) and
acr 70 (p = 0.041[30]) response rates and was more likely to
achieve das-28 remission (p = 0.012[30]) than placebo.[29]
● hr-qol was improved with  xxxd52xxx  compared with placebo
at both the 6-[17,18] and 12-month[18] assessments. improvements
from baseline were significantly greater with  xxxd52xxx  than placebo for all eight subscales of the sf-36 and for the physical and
mental component summary scores (all p < 0.05).[17,18]
● additional measures of hr-qol, including patient assessment
of pain, fatigue, and sleep quality,[18,19,25] generally showed greater
improvements from baseline with  xxxd52xxx  than placebo at 6
months (p < 0.001 for all comparisons apart from sleep quality in
the aim trial)[18,19,25] and 12 months[18,19] (all p < 0.01[30]). in the
attain trial, improvements from baseline at 6 months for pain,
fatigue, and sleep quality were 3-fold greater with  xxxd52xxx  than
placebo (all p < 0.001 vs placebo).[25]
extension studies

data from a 1-year nonblind extension of the 6-month attain
trial are available (reported as an abstract),[31] as are data from a
nonblind extension phase[18,19,32,33] of the 1-year phase ii dosefinding study discussed earlier.[15,16] patients from the  xxxd52xxx 
arm of the dose-finding trial[15,16] were eligible to continue treatment with  xxxd52xxx  plus background methotrexate.[18,19,32,33] of
the 84 patients who commenced the extension phase, 75[32,33] and

66[18,19] individuals completed a further 1 and 2 years of treatment
(i.e. received a total of 2 and 3 years of  xxxd52xxx ). ‘as observed’
data are reported as abstracts and posters.[18,19,32,33]
● the beneficial effect of  xxxd52xxx  on acr 20, acr 50, and
acr 70 responses achieved at the end of the 6-month doubleblind attain trial were maintained in the 168 patients who
completed the 1-year extension phase. in addition, the proportion
of patients achieving das-28 remission doubled (from 11% at the
end of the double-blind phase to 23% at the end of the 1-year
extension).[31]
● acr 20, acr 50, and acr 70 responses seen at 1 year in the
phase ii dose-finding study[15,16] were maintained at 2 years in the
75 patients who completed a further year of treatment with
 xxxd52xxx .[33] the ≈50% of patients who had achieved das-28
remission at 1 year continued to have das-28 remission at 2
years. in addition, 25% of patients showed a major clinical response at 2 years.[32]
● assessment of the 66 patients who received  xxxd52xxx  for an
additional 2 years in the extension phase showed that improvements in physical function, pain, and hr-qol seen with
 xxxd52xxx  at the end of the double-blind study were maintained at
the end of 3 years’ treatment.[18,19]
4. safety and tolerability
the safety of  xxxd52xxx  in patients with active rheumatoid
arthritis has been evaluated as a primary endpoint in the assure
( xxxd52xxx  study of safety in use with other rheumatoid arthritis
therapies) study, a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
 xxxd52xxx  as add-on therapy to either nonbiologic and/or biologic
background dmards.[34] additional tolerability data are available from the attain[17] and aim[21,23] trials, the first year of the
extension[35] of the phase ii dose-finding study[15,16] (see section 3
for design details of these trials), and integrated safety data available from the us fda briefing document[26] and the manufacturer’s prescribing information.[24]
in the assure study, patients received  xxxd52xxx  (n = 959)
according to the approved fixed-dose regimen tiered according to
bodyweight (see section 5 for details) or placebo (n = 482) for 1
year as well as one or more nonbiologic or biologic background
dmards.[34] the majority of patients in either treatment group
received background treatment with a nonbiologic dmard (856
 xxxd52xxx  and 418 placebo recipients). patients with stable medical
co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [copd], and congestive heart failure) were allowed to participate in the study. overall, 7% of patients had type
1 or 2 diabetes, 6% had asthma, 4% had copd, and 1% had
congestive heart failure. results are available as an abstract.[34]

●  xxxd52xxx  was generally well tolerated in patients with active
rheumatoid arthritis in the assure study.[34] overall, 5.3% of
 xxxd52xxx  and 3.9% of placebo recipients withdrew as a result of
adverse events and 2.7% and 9.1% withdrew due to lack of
efficacy. similar proportions of patients receiving  xxxd52xxx  or
placebo plus nonbiologic dmards withdrew from the assure
study as a result of adverse events (5.0% vs 4.3%), whereas 8.7%
of those receiving  xxxd52xxx  plus biologic dmards and 3.1% of
those receiving placebo plus biologic dmards withdrew for this
reason.[34]

the integrated safety data from 1955  xxxd52xxx  and 989 placebo recipients who also received background biologic or nonbiologic dmards in five phase ii and iii trials showed that the most
common adverse events occurring in ≥3% of patients in either
treatment arm and ≥1% more frequently with  xxxd52xxx  than
placebo were headache, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, cough, back
pain, hypertension, dyspepsia, urinary tract infections, rash, and
extremity pain (figure 2).[24]
●

acute infusion reactions (usually mild or moderate in intensity
and most commonly dizziness, headache, or hypertension) were
reported in 9% of  xxxd52xxx  and 6% of placebo recipients in the
phase iii clinical trials.[24] there were no differences among the
the individual phase iii trials in the tolerability profile of
 xxxd52xxx .[17,21,23,34]
●

● in the assure study, 95% of the 103 patients taking  xxxd52xxx 
together with background biologic dmards reported an adverse
event compared with 89% of those taking placebo plus biologic
dmards (n = 64), 90% of those taking  xxxd52xxx  plus nonbiologic dmards (n = 856), and 86% of those receiving placebo
plus nonbiologic dmards (n = 418).[34]
● the integrated safety data showed that serious infection occurred in 3.0% of  xxxd52xxx  and 1.9% of placebo recipients.[24] no
differences were seen between  xxxd52xxx  and placebo in the incidence of serious infections in the group of patients taking nonbiologic background dmards (2.8% vs 2.0%).[36]
● however, in those taking biologic background dmards, serious infections occurred in 4.4% of  xxxd52xxx  and 1.5% of placebo
recipients.[36] no unusual or opportunistic infections were reported
occurring with  xxxd52xxx  in any of the phase iii clinical
trials.[17,26,34] the proportions of patients reporting serious adverse
events, including those that were considered treatment-related,
stratified according to treatment subgroup ( xxxd52xxx  or placebo
with background nonbiologic or biologic dmards) are shown in
figure 3.[36]

in the combined analysis, serious adverse events were reported
in 13.6% of  xxxd52xxx  and 12.3% of placebo recipients,[36] and
3.0% of  xxxd52xxx  and 1.9% of placebo recipients had serious

infections.[24] malignant neoplasms were reported in similar proportions of  xxxd52xxx  and placebo recipients (1.3% vs 1.1%); the
potential role of  xxxd52xxx  in the development of malignancies in
humans is unknown.[24]
● in general, adverse events, serious adverse events, and infections may be more frequent when  xxxd52xxx  is administered concomitantly with biologic dmards, especially anti- xxxg2296xxx  therapies. consequently, the manufacturer recommends that  xxxd52xxx 
is only used in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiologic dmards (section 5).[24]
● assessment for the development of agent-specific antibodies
was carried out in in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had
received  xxxd52xxx  for up to 2 years.[24] a minority of patients
(1.7%; 34 of 1993 individuals) had developed anti- xxxd52xxx  antibodies directed against the entire  xxxd52xxx  molecule or the the
 xxxg544xxx  binding portion; however, no apparent effect on exposure,
safety, or efficacy was observed.
5. dosage and administration
 xxxd52xxx  is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, slowing the progression of structural
damage, and improving physical function in patients with moder© 2006 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

 xxxd52xxx  is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion
at the following doses: 500mg for patients with a bodyweight
<60kg; 750mg for those weighing 60–100kg; 1000mg for those
weighing >100kg. after the initial treatment,  xxxd52xxx  may be
administered at 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion and at
4-weekly intervals thereafter.[24] the manufacturer’s prescribing
information should be consulted for detailed information, including indications, contraindications, precautions, drug interactions,
and use in special patient populations.

6. current status:  xxxd52xxx 
a biologics license application for intravenous  xxxd52xxx  was
approved in the us in december 2005,[37] making it the first
selective costimulation modulator to reach the market. when
administered with background nonbiologic dmards in clinical
trials,  xxxd52xxx  has shown good efficacy and generally good
tolerability in adults with active rheumatoid arthritis who have
failed to respond adequately to other dmards.
