molecular pharmacology of human  xxxg308xxx  t-type ca2+ channels: block by antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, and their analogs.  antihypertensive drugs of the "calcium channel blocker" or "calcium antagonist" class have been used to establish the physiological role of l-type ca(2+) channels in vascular smooth muscle. in contrast, there has been limited progress on the pharmacology t-type ca(2+) channels. t-type channels play a role in cardiac pacemaking, aldosterone secretion, and renal hemodynamics, leading to the hypothesis that mixed t- and l-type blockers may have therapeutic advantages over selective l-type blockers. the goal of this study was to identify compounds that block the ca(v)3.2 t-type channel with high affinity, focusing on two classes of compounds: phenylalkylamines (e.g.,  xxxd2638xxx ) and dihydropyridines (e.g., efonidipine). compounds were tested using a validated ca(2+) influx assay into a cell line expressing recombinant ca(v)3.2 channels. this study identified four clinically approved antihypertensive drugs (efonidipine,  xxxd2092xxx , isradipine, and  xxxd2737xxx ) as potent t-channel blockers (ic(50) < 3 microm). in contrast, other widely prescribed dihydropyridines, such as amlodipine and nifedipine, were 10-fold less potent, making them a more appropriate choice in research studies on the role of l-type currents. in summary, the present results support the notion that many available antihypertensive drugs block a substantial fraction of t-current at therapeutically relevant concentrations, contributing to their mechanism of action.
