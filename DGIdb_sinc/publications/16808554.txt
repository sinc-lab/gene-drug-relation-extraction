abstract

background and objective: the search for nsaids with less gastrointestinal
toxicity led to the introduction of the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2)
inhibitors. however, following their introduction into the market, concerns have
developed regarding their safety, particularly their cardiovascular safety. the
purpose of this study was to assess the cardiovascular risk (events included were
myocardial infarction, stroke and myocardial infarction-related deaths) associated
with long-term (>180 days of exposure) and short-term (≤180 days of exposure)
use of non-selective nsaids, including ‘preferential cox-2 inhibitors’ (i.e.
 xxxd2065xxx ,  xxxd2688xxx  and  xxxd3163xxx ), and selective cox-2 inhibitors.
methods: a retrospective analysis of the veterans integrated service network 17
veterans affairs (va) database was conducted. medicare data and texas department of health mortality data were incorporated to capture events occurring
outside the va healthcare network. patients ≥35 years of age who received
celecoxib, rofecoxib, ibuprofen,  xxxd2065xxx  and naproxen from 1 january 1999
through 31 december 2001, were included. multivariate cox proportional hazard
models were used to analyse the relationship between cardiovascular risk and
nsaid use, including selective cox-2 inhibitor use, while adjusting for various
risk factors.
results: we identified 12 188 exposure periods (11 930 persons) and 146 cardiovascular events over the entire study period. compared with long-term ibuprofen
use, long-term use of celecoxib (adjusted hazard ratio [hr] 3.64; 95% ci 1.36,
9.70) and rofecoxib (adjusted hr 6.64; 95% ci 2.17, 20.28) was associated with a
significant increase in cardiovascular risk. when restricted to patients ≥65 years
of age, the cardiovascular risks associated with long-term celecoxib (adjusted hr
7.36; 95% ci 1.62, 33.48) and rofecoxib (adjusted hr 13.24; 95% ci 2.59, 67.68)
use increased. short-term use of celecoxib (adjusted hr 0.75; 95% ci 0.42, 1.35)
and rofecoxib (adjusted hr 0.85; 95% ci 0.39, 1.86) was not associated with any
significant change in cardiovascular risk when compared with short-term
ibuprofen use. neither long- nor short-term exposure to naproxen and  xxxd2065xxx

was associated with cardionegative or cardioprotective effects when compared
with ibuprofen use.
conclusions: the findings of this observational study, along with recent clinical
trial results, suggest that prolonged exposure to selective cox-2 inhibitors may
be associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

background
the gastrointestinal (gi) toxicity associated with
nsaids led to the search for and development of
the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) inhibitors.
this new generation of pain medication held the
promise of effective pain relief without the concern
of serious adverse effects. however, this perception
changed when a large prospective clinical trial
found a link between an increased risk of serious
cardiovascular events and rofecoxib use.[1] a 5-fold
increased risk of an acute myocardial infarction
(ami) was found with the use of rofecoxib 50 mg/
day compared with naproxen 1000 mg/day in the
vigor (vioxx® gastrointestinal outcomes research) study.[1] subsequently, clinical, epidemiological and other studies have provided supporting
evidence that the use of selective cox-2 inhibitors
may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.[2-15] in contrast, results from several
other clinical and epidemiological studies do not
support the hypothesis that selective cox-2 inhibitors increase cardiovascular risk.[16-23] these contrasting results may be due to different study populations, use of concomitant aspirin (acetylsalicylic
acid), cox-2 selectivity/agent-specific differences,
dose, comparator group and/or study duration. several biological mechanisms of actions have been
reported, ranging from changes in blood pressure,
effects on low-density lipoprotein (ldl) oxidation,
and effects on the prostanoid synthetic pathways.[24-26]
the purpose of this study was to investigate the
association between use of nsaids, including selective cox-2 inhibitors, and cardiovascular risk
among the texas, us, veterans affairs (va) population.

methods
data source

the study encompasses patients receiving healthcare services from the va heart of texas health
care network, termed the veterans integrated service network (visn) 17. this visn services a
population of 1 million veterans living across central
texas. most of this population are aged, disabled
and lack additional healthcare insurance. in addition
to the va, medicare provides medical coverage to
roughly 25% of veterans, with only 0.1% of veterans
having additional prescription coverage.[27] computerised medical files from the va allowed for
identification of drug exposure, cardiovascular risk
factors and study endpoint events amongst patients.
rofecoxib and celecoxib were both on a restricted
formulary, requiring many patients to receive prior
treatment with non-selective nsaids, including
‘preferential cox-2 inhibitors’ (i.e.  xxxd2065xxx ,
 xxxd2688xxx  and  xxxd3163xxx ).[28]
in order to minimise missing information due to
the use of outside healthcare coverage, medicare
data were obtained and analysed. a sensitivity analysis was conducted restricting the population to
those ≥65 years of age. this analysis was done to
address the potential influence of missing information resulting from the use of outside healthcare
coverage and to assess an older and sicker population. furthermore, to capture fatal cardiovascular
events occurring outside the medicare and va
healthcare systems, mortality data from the texas
department of health were collected and analysed.
this project was approved by all participating investigational review boards.
study population

patients ≥35 years of age who received a nonselective nsaid or selective cox-2 inhibitor between 1 january 1999 and 31 december 2001 were
drug safety 2006; 29 (7)

nsaid/cox-2 use and cardiovascular risk

included in the study. data from 1 january 1998 to
31 december 1998 were used to evaluate prior cardiovascular conditions, nsaid exposure, and confounding factors. patients were stratified into five
different study groups determined by non-selective
nsaid or selective cox-2 inhibitor exposure. the
study groups included patients who had received
naproxen, ibuprofen,  xxxd2065xxx , celecoxib and
rofecoxib, respectively. ibuprofen served as the control for the other four study groups. additionally,
naproxen and  xxxd2065xxx  served as control groups in
several sensitivity analyses.  xxxd2065xxx  was chosen as
a study group due to the high number of patients
using this drug and because several pharmacological
studies have found  xxxd2065xxx  to have some cox-2
selectivity.[29] to date, no study has specifically
examined the cardiovascular risk of  xxxd2065xxx .
because of the limited number of patients receiving high-dose rofecoxib (>25mg) and celecoxib
(≥300mg), a dose-response relationship was not
evaluated. the date of the initial prescription during
the study period was used as the index date. patients
who received a prescription for any selective cox-2
inhibitor or non-selective nsaid within the 6
months prior to their index date were excluded from
the study. additionally, patients were excluded if
they were exposed to the cohort-defining drug in the
year prior to the index date. the duration of cohort
involvement started on the index date and lasted
until the individual experienced a censorship point:
a study endpoint event, exposure to other nsaids,
including selective cox-2 inhibitors, death, discontinuation of study medication or the end of the study.
patients were allowed to re-enter the cohort or join a
new cohort if the patient met the inclusion criteria.
additionally, patients who experienced a study
endpoint were not allowed to re-enter the study. a
sensitivity analysis was conducted assessing only
the first non-selective nsaid or selective cox-2
inhibitor exposure.
study periods

in order to assess the cardiovascular effect of
long-term exposure versus short-term exposure to
nsaids (including selective cox-2 inhibitors), the
study evaluated events occurring before and after
180 days of exposure to study medications. patients
who experienced a study endpoint (i.e. acute myo© 2006 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

cardial infarction [ami], stroke, and/or ami-related
death) during the first 180 days of exposure were
excluded from the long-term analysis. the a priori
decision to evaluate risk after 180 days of exposure
was due to the limited availability of long-term data
from clinical trials.
to evaluate short-term cardiovascular risk, the
evaluation period was limited to ≤180 days of therapy. the association between overall use (risk after
first day of use) of nsaids, including selective
cox-2 inhibitors, and cardiovascular risk was also
assessed.
a series of post hoc analyses with the exposure
time changed to 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, 150
days, 210 days and 240 days, was conducted. the
purpose of these post hoc analyses was to further
explore the relationship between exposure time and
cardiovascular events.
patients who received <30 days of study medication were excluded from the study. furthermore,
only observation periods with two or more prescriptions were considered. patients who were dispensed
more than one study drug on the index date were
excluded. patients were allowed a grace period that
was 20% of the previous prescribed duration of
supply to refill the next prescription. inpatient pharmacy data were available for a portion of the population; patients receiving a study drug while admitted
to the hospital were allowed a 10-day grace period in
which to experience a subsequent exposure. to ensure an adequate baseline assessment, patient observations without at least 1 year of prior healthcare use
within the va healthcare system were excluded.
study variables

the primary study endpoint was the combination
of either a diagnosis for an ami, death from an ami
or a cerebrovascular event. specifically, a study
endpoint required an international classification of
diseases – 9th edition (icd-9) discharge diagnosis
code of 410 (ami), an icd-10 ami cause of death
code of i21–i22, or an icd-9 discharge diagnosis
for cerebrovascular events using a high-specificity
model.[30] a study within the va healthcare system
assessing code veracity of stroke-related icd-9
codes has been conducted. the high-specificity algorithm yielded 59% sensitivity and 84% specificidrug safety 2006; 29 (7)

624

ty; the high-sensitivity model yielded 89% sensitivity and 57% specificity.[30] research conducted within the va healthcare system found a 96.9% positive
predictive value for amis coded in the primary
position.[31] patients discharged alive were required
to have a length of stay of no less than 3 days and no
greater than 180 days. of note, the duration of stay
and position of the icd-9 code were not available
for this study, thus possibly decreasing the positive
predictive value of the ami diagnosis.
a recent study in medicare recipients evaluated
the validity of ami icd-9 codes. this study found a
92.3% positive predictive value for an ami coded in
the primary or secondary position without a length
of stay restriction, providing some flexibility with
regards to field position and length-of-stay requirements.[32] diagnostic coding for cardiovascular-related deaths is believed to be less accurate; however,
it is necessary for capturing fatal myocardial infarctions that occur outside the hospital.
to address concerns regarding the choice of
endpoint events, several sensitivity analyses were
conducted that varied this parameter. these included assessing only ami and ami-related deaths,
evaluating a high-sensitivity stroke model in place
of the high-specificity model[30] and expanding the
mortality definition to death from ischaemic heart
disease (icd-10 codes i20–i25) and death from any
major cardiovascular disease (icd-10 codes
i00–i78).
baseline covariates

a 1-year baseline period prior to the index date
was used to evaluate and control for potential confounding factors. these factors include life threatening conditions (neoplasms, hiv, renal failure, respiratory failure, insufficiency and arrest); cardiovascular conditions (heart failure, prior myocardial
infarction, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease [icd-9 code or prescription for  xxxd1698xxx ,  xxxd1772xxx  or  xxxd2880xxx ], angina [icd-9
code or prescription for a nitrate] and atrial fibrillation); diabetes mellitus (icd-9 code or use of a
antidiabetic medication); inflammatory conditions
(osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus and connective tissue disorders); and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).

baseline medications included beta-adrenoceptor
antagonists (beta-blockers), calcium channel antagonists, digoxin, other hypertensive medications, loop
diuretics, methotrexate, warfarin, ace inhibitors/
 xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists, antiplatelet
drugs, antirheumatic drugs, corticosteroids, cholesterol-lowering drugs, other diuretics and other anticoagulants.
a separate analysis was conducted to evaluate
baseline differences in body mass index (bmi),
blood pressure readings, and cholesterol levels. patient vital signs and laboratory readings occurring in
the year prior to the index date were averaged into a
single value. because of the limited availability of
readings for all patients, these variables were not
factored into the model.
statistical analyses

an historical cohort study design was used to
analyse the cardiovascular effects of the specified
nsaids and selective cox-2 inhibitors. an alpha
level of 0.05 was used to test for statistical significance. analyses and data management were conducted with spss 12.0 (spss, chicago, il, usa)
and sas 8.2 (sas, cary, nc, usa). analysis of
events in relation to person-time was analysed via
the cox proportional hazard model. the wald test
was used to determine statistical differences between individual nonselective nsaids and selective cox-2 inhibitors.
results
during the study period, 84 677 individuals
(122 683 observations) were exposed to nsaids,
including selective cox-2 inhibitors, with 11 930
individuals (12 188 observations) meeting the study
criteria. of note, the majority of the censored observations resulted from sporadic use (receiving <30
days and/or receiving only one prescription of the
study medications). of the 12 188 eligible observations, 4481 (36.8%) were of ibuprofen use, 3240
(26.6%) were of naproxen use, 1530 (12.6%) were
of celecoxib use, 2371 (19.5%) were of  xxxd2065xxx  use
and 566 (4.6%) were of rofecoxib use. the majority
of the observations were for short-term use (≤180
days), comprising roughly 60% of the celecoxib and
rofecoxib observations and roughly 75% of
drug safety 2006; 29 (7)

nsaid/cox-2 use and cardiovascular risk

ibuprofen,  xxxd2065xxx  and naproxen observations.
more than 90% of the population consisted of men,
with similar proportions in each of the cohorts.
patients taking celecoxib or rofecoxib were, on average, 7 years older than patients taking ibuprofen,
 xxxd2065xxx  or naproxen. furthermore, a higher percentage of patients taking celecoxib or rofecoxib
had cancer, diabetes, arthritis and cardiovascular
conditions (table i). baseline laboratory data and
other patient measurements were assessed using
available readings. when comparing values across
the study groups, blood pressure, cholesterol level
and bmi values varied slightly between the categories (table ii). however, lower total cholesterol and
ldl-cholesterol levels were found in the celecoxib
and rofecoxib cohorts than in the other study cohorts. no relevant differences with regards to baseline vital signs and laboratory parameters were
found between overall users, short-term or longterm users of the study medications.
when adjusting for the covariates listed in table i,
the results did not reveal a statistically significant
association between overall use (long-term and
short-term use combined) of any of the study medications and cardiovascular risk (table iii). specifically, when compared with ibuprofen, the results
yielded an adjusted hazard ratio (hr) of 1.13 (95%
ci 0.70, 1.83) for celecoxib users; 1.59 (95% ci
0.87, 2.90) for rofecoxib users, 0.82 (95% ci 0.48,
1.40) for  xxxd2065xxx  users, and 0.86 (95% ci 0.53,
1.40) for naproxen users.
several covariates in the model were associated
with a statistically significant increased cardiovascular risk. these included copd, osteoarthritis, prior ami and stroke, age and use of beta-blockers, loop
diuretics, methotrexate or antiplatelets. other
covariates did not show statistically significant associations, but may have contributed to the model.
after partitioning patients into short-term and
long-term users, long-term use of celecoxib and
rofecoxib was associated with a significant increase
in cardiovascular risk when compared with longterm ibuprofen use (adjusted hr 3.64; 95% ci 1.36,
9.70 and adjusted hr 6.64; 95% ci 2.17, 20.28,
respectively). in contrast, a statistically significant
increase in cardiovascular risk was not found in
patients who received long-term  xxxd2065xxx  (adjusted
hr 1.26; 95% ci 0.35, 4.56) or naproxen (adjusted

hr 1.15; 95% ci 0.35, 3.77) when compared with
long-term ibuprofen users. short-term use of any
non-selective nsaid or selective cox-2 inhibitor
was not associated with an increased or decreased
cardiovascular risk when compared with short-term
ibuprofen use (table iii). the post hoc temporal
assessments further demonstrate the increasing cardiovascular risk over time with celecoxib and
rofecoxib use (table iv). no significant change in
risk over time was found in the post hoc temporal
assessment of  xxxd2065xxx  and naproxen.
several sensitivity analyses were conducted.
these included using only the first non-selective
nsaid or selective cox-2 inhibitor exposure;
modification of the primary endpoint; using different comparator nsaids; and restricting the population to those patients who were ≥65 years of age.
the sensitivity analyses using only the first nonselective nsaid or selective cox-2 inhibitor exposure resulted in findings similar to those reported
previously. regarding the primary endpoint definition (ami, death from an ami, or a cerebrovascular
event), comparable results were found when restricting the primary endpoint to serious coronary events
(ami or death from an ami). when expanding the
mortality definition of the primary endpoint to include deaths from ischaemic heart disease, comparable results were also found. however, two of the
sensitivity analyses varying the primary end-point
yielded different results; these included changing
the mortality definition from an ami-related death
to death from a major cardiovascular disease and
replacing the high-specificity stroke model with the
high-sensitivity stroke model. after modifying the
mortality definition to capture death from any major
cardiovascular disease, the long-term use of
celecoxib was no longer statistically associated with
an increased cardiovascular risk when compared
with long-term ibuprofen use (adjusted hr, 2.17,
95% ci 0.94, 5.03). all other results were comparable. regarding the high-sensitivity stroke model, all
results were found to be statistically non-significant.
the following sensitivity analyses evaluated the
use of different comparator groups, i.e. naproxen
and  xxxd2065xxx . compared with ibuprofen, naproxen
yielded similar adjusted hrs in all categories. longterm users of celecoxib and rofecoxib users were
significantly more likely to experience a primary

other results were comparable to results obtained
with models using ibuprofen as the control group.
the patients included in the analysis were restricted to those aged ≥65 years to assess an older
population who more at risk for cardiovascular disease. when evaluating the primary study endpoint
and restricting included patients to those ≥65 years
of age, long-term celecoxib use yielded an adjusted
hr of 7.36 (95% ci 1.62, 33.48) and long-term
rofecoxib use yielded an adjusted hr of 13.24 (95%
ci 2.59, 67.68) when compared with long-term
ibuprofen use. a statistically significant association
between overall rofecoxib use and cardiovascular
risk was found in this age group when compared
with ibuprofen use (adjusted hr 2.14; 95% ci 1.09,
4.19). for all other comparisons, no statistically
significant differences were found.
discussion
the results of this study suggest a temporal relationship between cardiovascular risk and the use of
celecoxib and rofecoxib. after long-term exposure
to celecoxib and rofecoxib, an increased risk of a
cardiovascular event (defined as ami, death from
an ami or a cerebrovascular event) was found.
long-term exposure to celecoxib and rofecoxib significantly increased the risk for a cardiovascular
event. when the long-term use of non-selective
nsaids and selective cox-2 inhibitors was restricted to patients ≥65 years of age, the adjusted
hrs associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib use
nearly doubled, defining a population at greater

cardiovascular risk. this study failed to find an
increased risk associated with short-term use of either celecoxib or rofecoxib. although  xxxd2065xxx  has
been found to possess some affinity for the cox-2
enzyme over the cox-1 enzyme, an elevated cardiovascular risk was not found with this drug. in
contrast to some studies, our study did not find a
cardioprotective effect associated with naproxen
use.[3]
a wide range of results from observational studies have been reported regarding the cardiovascular
safety
of
rofecoxib
and
celecoxib.[2,4-6,10-14,16,17,22,33,34] one study even found a cardioprotective effect among celecoxib users when
compared with patients who were not receiving
nsaids.[6] however, the study had several limitations (i.e. possibility of recall bias and low-response
rate) and when compared with other nsaid users,
the protective effect was not found. our study similarly found no increase in cardiovascular risk for the
overall exposure (combination of short-term and
long-term users) to celecoxib.
however, unlike previous studies, our study segmented the population into two time periods to
evaluate the cardiovascular risk after long-term exposure (>180 days) and short-term exposure (≤180
days). the long-term use of celecoxib was found to
be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk,
whereas short-term exposure to celecoxib was not
associated with an increased risk. studies may have
failed to detect a cardiovascular risk with overall
celecoxib use because of the higher proportion of
patients taking celecoxib in the short term, as opdrug safety 2006; 29 (7)

nsaid/cox-2 use and cardiovascular risk

posed to long term, thereby diluting the hazard.
specifically, by assuming a proportional hazard rate
when duration of exposure is related to an increased
cardiovascular risk, the early hazard is overestimated and the later hazard is underestimated. therefore,
if a population primarily consists of short-term and
sporadic users, the cardiovascular risk of long-term
users may be nullified.
in addition, each non-selective nsaid and selective cox-2 inhibitor has unique properties that may
detract from or contribute to cardiovascular risk.
ibuprofen was chosen as the baseline comparator
because it has not been associated with an increase
or decrease in cardiovascular risk. however,
ibuprofen has been found to have a greater inhibitory effect on the antiplatelet effects of aspirin than
celecoxib and rofecoxib, resulting in a possible increased number of cardiovascular events among
ibuprofen users.[35,36] with regards to the sensitivity
analyses using different comparator nsaids, similar results in all models were found with naproxen as
the comparator nsaid. additionally,  xxxd2065xxx 
yielded similar results; however, the increased risk
associated with long-term celecoxib use was no
longer statistically significant. this could be attributed to the cox-2 selectivity of  xxxd2065xxx  and/or the
smaller sample size (~25% fewer observations than
naproxen and ~60% fewer observations than
ibuprofen).
to evaluate the full range of possibilities, the
primary endpoint was changed to capture additional
stroke cases (high-sensitivity model). this alteration
resulted in non-significant results in all analyses. of
note, previous research has found a high percentage
of false-positive cerebrovascular events when using
this model of nearly 40%.[30] due to the difficulty in
evaluating stroke cases from icd-9 codes, only
ami and ami-related deaths were evaluated. this
sensitivity analysis yielded similar results to the
primary endpoint analyses. when expanding the
definition of the primary model to include death
from ischaemic heart disease, no significant changes
in any of the models were found. when any major
cardiovascular disease-related death was assessed,
similar results were found; however, the increased
risk associated with the long-term use of celecoxib
was no longer statistically significant. the statistically non-significant result may be explained by the

broad scope of conditions found in the ‘any major
cardiovascular disease’ category, ranging from hypertensive diseases through rheumatic fever.
many of the observational studies have revealed
no statistically significant increase in cardiovascular
risk when exposed to low doses of rofecoxib
(≤25mg).[2,4,5] additionally, studies combining highdose (>25mg) and low-dose rofecoxib use failed to
find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk.[16,17] as with previous studies, our study
did not find an increased risk associated with shortterm and overall use of rofecoxib. however, an
increased risk was found with long-term use of
rofecoxib. similar to the reason for not finding a
cardiovascular risk with celecoxib in previous observational studies, the cardiovascular risk associated with rofecoxib may have been diluted by the
disproportionate number of short-term and sporadic
users. based on the findings from epidemiological
studies and the vigor study, the cardiovascular
signal for high-dose (>25mg) rofecoxib seems to be
much stronger than for low-dose rofecoxib use.[1,2,5]
however, due to the low number of high-dose
rofecoxib users in our study population, a doseresponse relationship could not be examined.
the temporal findings in our study contrast with
those from a study conducted by solomon et al.[4]
that study evaluated the association between duration of rofecoxib and celecoxib exposure (≤30 days;
31–90 days; and >90 days) and ami events. compared with celecoxib, short-term exposure (≤90
days) to rofecoxib was associated with an increased
cardiovascular risk. the increased cardiovascular
risk dissipated in patients with more than days of
rofecoxib use. the study failed to show an increased
risk in any time period for celecoxib when compared
with rofecoxib. a follow-up study conducted by
solomon et al.[13] in the same population found
similar results to their previous study, with the exception of a persistent cardiovascular risk over a
3-year period for rofecoxib users versus nonnsaid users. a possible reason for the discrepancy
between the studies by solomon et al.[4,13] and our
study is the different definitions of long-term use,
exclusion of patients with ≤30 days of exposure,
different comparator groups and study design. furthermore, our study comprised a different patient
population with different characteristics (e.g. primadrug safety 2006; 29 (7)

630

rily consisting of men). additionally, a study conducted by huang and colleagues[33] evaluated the
long-term (≥180 days exposure) cardiovascular
safety of celecoxib and rofecoxib compared with
 xxxd2561xxx . this study found a lower cardiovascular
risk with celecoxib and no difference in cardiovascular risk with rofecoxib compared with  xxxd2561xxx .
the use of  xxxd2561xxx  as a comparator group and/or
other study parameters may explain the differing
results.
there are several limitations when evaluating the
cardiovascular safety in clinical trials. although
clinical trials are considered the gold standard for
determining safety and efficacy, they usually involve a small number of patients and may not be
powered to detect unexpected adverse effects (such
as cardiovascular disease). furthermore, many of
the clinical trials involved short durations of therapy
and were unable to show the ramifications of longterm exposure. in attempts to obtain ‘clean’ results,
many of these studies exclude individuals with various risk factors (i.e. cardiovascular risk factors).
therefore, many of the studies evaluating selective
cox-2 inhibitors may not be representative of the
population actually receiving the drug.
two clinical trials supporting our results (in addition to the vigor study) are the approve (adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx) trial and the
apc (adenoma prevention with celecoxib) trial.[7,9]
in both of these trials, a significant cardiovascular
risk was found with rofecoxib and celecoxib after
long-term use when compared with a placebo group.
in the approve trial, the first 18 months of therapy
were not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk (relative risk [rr] 1.18; 95% ci 0.64, 2.15);
however, after 18 months of therapy, a significant
increased risk was found (rr 4.45; 95% ci 1.77,
13.32).[7] this result lends support to a relationship
between prolonged exposure to cox-2 inhibitors
and cardiovascular risk. regarding the apc trial,
patients taking celecoxib in this long-term cancer
prevention trial had a higher risk of experiencing a
cardiovascular event as compared with those taking
a placebo. specifically, patients taking celecoxib
400mg daily were 2.5 times (95% ci 1.0, 6.4) more
likely to have a cardiovascular event than placebo
recipients, and patients taking celecoxib 800mg
were 3.4 times (95% ci 1.4, 8.5) more likely to have

an event.[9] of note, our study primarily consisted of
low dose (<300mg) celecoxib users. in contrast,
another long-term study, the presap (prevention of
spontaneous adenomatopus polyps) trial, did not
reveal an increased risk of cardiovascular events for
patients taking celecoxib 400mg daily compared
with those taking placebo.[23]
to further elaborate on the cardiovascular risk
associated with cox-2 inhibitors, a randomised,
placebo-controlled study performed in patients receiving  xxxd3481xxx  and its intravenous prodrug
paracoxib immediately after coronary-artery bypass
grafting showed an increased cardiovascular risk
compared with placebo (rr 3.7; 95% ci 1.0, 13.5; p
= 0.03).[8] this adds to the hypothesis that individuals already at an increased risk of cardiovascular
events are more susceptible to the negative cardiovascular effects of cox-2 inhibitors.[37-41]
with any observational study several limitations
exist. with regards to hospital proximity, va patients not living near a va hospital may have limited
ability to receive healthcare services from a va
facility in the event of a major cardiovascular event.
to control for this factor, medicare data were obtained to capture events occurring outside the va
healthcare system. a previous study was conducted
evaluating point of care for ami among elderly
veterans (≥65 years).[42] this study found that more
than half (54%) of elderly veterans with prior use of
the va medical system were initially hospitalised in
a medicare hospital when they suffered an ami.
although the medicare data will help capture events
occurring outside the va medical system in patients
enrolled in medicare, data for individuals not enrolled who experience an event may not be captured.
in our study, individuals receiving celecoxib and
rofecoxib were found to have higher percentages of
baseline risk factors than those receiving ibuprofen,
 xxxd2065xxx  and naproxen. this could be explained by
the larger percentage of individuals aged >65 years
who had received celecoxib (63.3%) and rofecoxib
(59.3%) than ibuprofen (33.2%),  xxxd2065xxx  (38.4%)
and naproxen (36.9%). additionally, the adjusted
model helps to control for these factors. regarding
prescription coverage, even though automated pharmacy claims are one of the best sources of information on drug use,[43] information concerning compliance and the use of drugs from outside sources may

nsaid/cox-2 use and cardiovascular risk

be lacking. concurrent use of aspirin was allowed in
this study; however, very few patients were found to
have overlapping use. therefore, many patients may
have been taking over-the-counter aspirin. this parameter would only be a problem if use differed
across the study groups. comparable percentages of
baseline aspirin use were found between all five
study groups (~30%). furthermore, other studies
evaluating this issue have not shown a difference in
aspirin use between patients who took non-selective
nsaids and those who took selective cox-2 inhibitors.[4,5] only select medications and icd-9 codes
were available for analysis, thereby limiting the
ability to determine overall disease burden or the
frequency of medical care. it is unknown if these
variables would significantly contribute to this
study. because of the population studied and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, the results from
this study may not be generalisable to individuals
not reflective of the study population. one of the
primary differences is the disproportionate number
of men compared with women. however, this difference may be advantageous because most (if not all)
of the previous observational studies evaluating selective cox-2 inhibitor-related cardiovascular risk
consisted primarily of women.[2,4,5,16] a large proportion of this population was estimated to be at risk
for cardiovascular disease and results may not be
reflective of healthier populations. because of the
small number of observations and endpoint events,
caution is advised when interpreting these results.
conclusion
nsaids, including selective cox-2 inhibitors,
are some of the most widely prescribed medications
in the world. due to this factor, the findings of this
study have wide reaching implications. two longterm prospective clinical trials now support the findings of this study.[7,9] however, additional studies
are needed to examine this issue with regards to
celecoxib and other cox-2 inhibitors currently on
the market or under evaluation, especially in a population at risk for cardiovascular disease. however,
some may question if it is even ethical to conduct
such a study. because of the findings of this study
and two prospective clinical trials,[7,9] caution is
advised in the prolonged use of celecoxib or
