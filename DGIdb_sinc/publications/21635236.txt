summary
purpose: to assess the pharmacology of  xxxd2881xxx  and
its antiseizure activity in preclinical models.  xxxd2881xxx 
[2-(2-oxo-1-phenyl-5-pyridin-2-yl-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)
benzonitrile] is a novel, orally active, prospective antiepileptic agent currently in development for refractory partial-onset seizures.
methods:  xxxd2881xxx  pharmacology was assessed by
examining changes in intracellular free ca2+ ion concentration ([ca2+]i) in primary rat cortical neurones, and
[3h] xxxd2881xxx  binding to rat forebrain membranes. antiseizure activity of orally administered  xxxd2881xxx  was
examined in amygdala-kindled rats and in mice exhibiting
audiogenic, maximal electroshock (mes)–induced, pentylenetetrazole (ptz) –induced, or 6 hz-induced seizures.
key findings: in cultured rat cortical neurones,  xxxd2881xxx  inhibited a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa)–induced increases in [ca2+]i (ic50
93 nm vs. 2 lm ampa).  xxxd2881xxx  had a minimal effect
on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)–induced increases in
[ca2+]i, and only at a high concentration (30 lm). [3h] xxxd2881xxx  binding to rat forebrain membranes was not significantly displaced by glutamate or ampa but was
displaced by the noncompetitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonists cp465022 (ki 11.2 ± 0.8 nm) and gyki52466

epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder that is estimated to affect 1–2% of the world population (browne &
holmes, 2001). in recent years, the number of new antiepileptic drugs (aeds) gaining regulatory approval has
increased markedly. however, despite the introduction of
agents with novel mechanisms of action, it is estimated that
more than one third of patients continue to experience

(ki 12.4 ± 1 lm). in mice,  xxxd2881xxx  showed protective effects against audiogenic, mes-induced, and
ptz-induced seizures (ed50s 0.47, 1.6, and 0.94 mg/kg,
respectively).  xxxd2881xxx  also inhibited 6 hz electroshock-induced seizures when administered alone or in
combination with other antiepileptic drugs (aeds). in
amygdala-kindled rats,  xxxd2881xxx  significantly increased
afterdischarge threshold (p < 0.05 vs. vehicle), and significantly reduced motor seizure duration, afterdischarge
duration, and seizure severity recorded at 50% higher
intensity than afterdischarge threshold current (p < 0.05
for all measures vs. vehicle).  xxxd2881xxx  caused dosedependent motor impairment in both mice (td50 1.8 mg/
kg) and rats (td50 9.14 mg/kg), as determined by rotarod
tests. in mice, the protective index (td50 in rotarod test/
ed50 in seizure test) was 1.1, 3.8, and 1.9 for mes-induced,
audiogenic, and ptz-induced seizures, respectively. in
rat, dog, and monkey,  xxxd2881xxx  had a half-life of 1.67,
5.34, and 7.55 h and bioavailability of 46.1%, 53.5%, and
74.5%, respectively.
significance: these data suggest that  xxxd2881xxx  is an
orally active, noncompetitive, selective  xxxg981xxx 
antagonist with potential as a broad spectrum antiepileptic agent.
key words: antiseizure, broad spectrum, antiepileptic agent.

partial seizures that are refractory to current treatments
(perucca et al., 2007).
adjunctive therapy is widely used in the treatment of
epilepsy. selecting appropriate aed combinations is difficult, however, and quantitative techniques measuring efficacy and side effects of different aed combinations in
preclinical studies have not proven useful in predicting
clinical benefits (stafstrom, 2010). currently, aed combinations are chosen based on avoidance of drug–drug interactions and unwanted side effects rather than on evidence
of improved efficacy (french & faught, 2009). many
aeds target similar pathways [such as voltage-gated ion
channels or c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)–mediated neurotransmission) or have multiple mechanisms of action that

1331

t. hanada et al.
may contribute to the difficulty in predicting clinical
efficacy of drug combinations. as new data on drug combinations and novel aeds emerge, successful rational
polytherapy may evolve based on synergistic effects of
aeds, and drugs with different and discrete mechanisms
of action may potentially be the most effective in this
regard.
encouragingly, the development pipeline for aeds
contains a number of novel compounds with discrete
mechanisms of action that have largely been identified
using mechanism-independent preclinical seizure models
(rogawski, 2006). several of these developmental compounds target the  xxxg981xxx  subfamily of ionotropic
glutamate receptors. ampa receptors, named after the
selective agonist a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa), are activated by glutamate,
the major excitatory neurotransmitter, which is thought to
play a key role in inducing seizures by initiating and synchronizing glutamatergic transmission (scharfman, 2007).
ampa itself, administered systemically or by cerebroventricular infusion, is able to elicit seizures in preclinical
models, thereby supporting a role for ampa receptors in
the development of seizures (meldrum & rogawski,
2007).
 xxxg981xxx  antagonists have been investigated for
antiseizure activity both preclinically and clinically, with
mixed success. the prototypical competitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]
quinoxaline (nbqx) showed activity in maximal electroshock (mes) and pentylenetetrazole (ptz)–induced seizure
models (yamaguchi et al., 1993), but has poor solubility,
resulting in precipitation in the kidney at therapeutic plasma
levels. derivatives of nbqx with polar constituents have
shown improved solubility, but these molecules exhibit
reduced blood–brain barrier (bbb) penetration (weiser,
2005). prototypical noncompetitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonists, such as 2,3-benzodiazepine-type compounds, have
shown weak in vitro efficacy compared with competitive
antagonists, but good in vivo efficacy, indicating substantial
bbb penetration (weiser, 2005).  xxxd3279xxx , a recently
developed noncompetitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonist,
has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials (howes &
bell, 2007), but has a relatively short half-life, which
may limit its utility in the clinical setting (langan et al.,
2003).
herein, we report on the in vitro and in vivo activity of
 xxxd2881xxx , a novel, orally active, prospective antiepileptic
agent currently in phase iii clinical studies for refractory
partial-onset seizures. we provide evidence to suggest that
 xxxd2881xxx  is a potent, noncompetitive and selective ampa
receptor antagonist with broad spectrum anticonvulsant
activity in preclinical models.  xxxd2881xxx  [2-(2-oxo-1-phenyl-5-pyridin-2-yl-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl) benzonitrile] is
structurally dissimilar to other  xxxg981xxx  ligands that
show antiseizure activity (fig. 1).

methods
all animal experiments were performed in compliance
with the regulations of the animal ethical committee of
eisai co., ltd. animals were kept at approximately 23c
(permitted range 20–26c) in 55% relative humidity (permitted range 40–70%) with a 12-h dark/light cycle (lighting
between 07:00 and 19:00).
materials
reagents were purchased from the following sources:
gyki52466, n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda), and mk-801
from sigma/rbi (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.); (rs)-ampa
from tocris cookson inc. (ellisville, mo, u.s.a.); tetrodotoxin (ttx) from sankyo (tokyo, japan); and fura-2-am
from dojin chemical (tokyo, japan).  xxxd2881xxx  was
synthesized by eisai co., ltd. (tokyo, japan).
rat cortical neuron cultures
rat cortical neuron cultures were prepared based on the
method described by abe et al. (1990). briefly, the cerebral
cortex was excised from embryonic day 18 (e18) wistar
rats (charles river japan, kanagawa, japan) and dissociated by incubation for 30 min at 37c in ca2+/mg2+-free
hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  containing 10 mm 4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (hepes),

1333
 xxxd2881xxx : a novel ampa-r antagonist
3.3 mm d-glucose, 0.25% trypsin, 0.2 mg/ml dnase i,
50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 lg/ml streptomycin. cells
were resuspended in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs)
and plated at a density of 1 · 105 cells/well on 96-well test
plates on an astrocyte feeder layer. cultures were maintained without exchange of medium for 7–17 days at 37c
in a 5% co2/95% air incubator.
rat forebrain neuronal membranes
rat forebrain membranes were prepared as described
previously (balannik et al., 2005). briefly, forebrains of
sprague-dawley rats were homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m
sucrose containing 0.1 mm egta (ph 7.4) and centrifuged
at 1,000 g for 10 min. the supernatant was centrifuged at
30,000 g for 20 min and the resulting pellet was lysed in
1 mm egta/tris–hcl (ph 8.0) and centrifuged at
30,000 g for 20 min to collect the membranes. this lysis
and centrifugation step was repeated, and the pellet was
resuspended in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.4). membranes were sonicated and washed three times, resuspended in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.4), and stored at
)80c. before use, aliquots were thawed and sonicated,
washed twice in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer, and resuspended
at 0.5 mg/ml with 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.4).
measurements of intracellular free calcium
concentration
changes in intracellular free ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i)
were measured in rat cortical neurons using the fluorescent
ca2+ indicator dye fura-2, as described previously (fischer
et al., 2000). cells were incubated with fura-2 am (10 lm)
in a 5% co2/95% air incubator at 37c for 2 h and washed
with ca2+ assay buffer (140 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 2 mm
mgcl2, 3 mm cacl2, 24 mm d(+)-glucose, 10 mm hepes,
1 lm mk801; ph 7.4 adjusted with naoh for ampa).
changes in [ca2+]i were determined by fluorimetry (fluorescence drug screening system, hamamatsu photonics,
shizuoka, japan) by measuring changes in the fluorescence
emission ratio of fura-2 after consecutive excitations at 340
and 380 nm wavelengths. ampa (2 lm) and nmda
(100 lm) were used to stimulate specific receptor subtypes,
and the inhibitory effects of  xxxd2881xxx , gyki52466, and
mk-801 on these responses were assessed. ca2+ assay buffer without mgcl2 or mk-801 was used in assays involving
nmda.
radiolabeled  xxxd2881xxx  binding assay
specific and nonspecific binding of [3h] xxxd2881xxx  to
rat forebrain neuronal membranes was measured in the presence and absence of various  xxxg981xxx  agonists and
antagonists. briefly, membranes and compounds were
mixed with 50 nm [3h] xxxd2881xxx  (specific activity
1.92 tbq/mm) and incubated for 1.5 h at 4c. samples
were filtered onto whatman gf/b glass-fiber filters presoa-

ked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine and washed three times with
2 ml ice-cold 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.4) using a
brandel m-30r cell harvester. radioactivity was quantified
by liquid scintillation counting. nonspecific binding was
determined by incubation with 15 lm  xxxd2881xxx . specific
binding was determined by subtraction of nonspecific binding from total binding.
mouse seizure models
the effects of  xxxd2881xxx  on audiogenic, mes-induced,
and ptz-induced seizures were determined in mice. drug
doses and pretreatment times were chosen based on results
from preliminary experiments. pretreatment time in all
rodent models was within the range of tmax values for  xxxd2881xxx  in mice (0.5–1 h) and rats (0.5–1 h).
mes-induced seizures
electroshock seizures were induced in 4-week-old male
ddy mice obtained from japan slc inc. (shizuoka, japan).
animals were dosed orally with  xxxd2881xxx  (0.75, 1.06,
1.50, or 2.12 mg/kg), carbamazepine (9.2, 13, 18.4, or
26 mg/kg), sodium valproate (284, 400, 567, or 800 mg/
kg), or vehicle 1 h prior to electrical stimulation. an electrical stimulus (80 v) was applied to both corneas for 0.4 s.
an occurrence of electroshock-induced tonic extension
(te) was defined as a hindlimb te lasting >1 s following
stimulation. fifty percent effective dose (ed50) and 95%
confidence intervals (cis) for te inhibition were calculated
by regression analyses.
audiogenic seizures
audiogenic seizures were induced in 3-week-old male
dba/2j mice obtained from clea japan, inc. (tokyo,
japan). mice were dosed orally with  xxxd2881xxx  (0.3, 1, or
3 mg/kg), carbamazepine (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg), sodium valproate (30, 100, or 300 mg/kg), or vehicle 1 h prior to initiation of seizures. mice were then habituated for 1 min in an
observation box and exposed to sound stimulation (11 khz,
115 db) for 1 min or until te occurred. an occurrence of
sound-induced seizure was defined as a hindlimb te lasting
>1 s during sound stimulation.
ptz-induced seizures
ptz-induced seizures were generated in 9-week-old male
icr mice obtained from crj inc. (kanagawa, japan). animals were dosed orally with  xxxd2881xxx  (0.75, 1.5, or 3 mg/
kg), carbamazepine (100 mg/kg), sodium valproate (150,
300, or 600 mg/kg), or vehicle 30 min prior to initiation of
seizures. a 30 min pretreatment time was chosen in this
model to allow for ptz-induced seizures to be measured
within the range of tmax (0.5–1 h). seizures were then
induced by subcutaneous injection of ptz (90 mg/kg).
an occurrence of ptz-induced seizure was defined as a
seizure of at least 3 s duration within 30 min of ptz
administration.

t. hanada et al.
six-hertz electroshock-induced seizures
 xxxd2881xxx  (0.5, 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg) was administered
orally to 9-week-old male icr mice 1 h prior to test. an
electrical stimulus (6 hz, 0.2 ms rectangular pulse, 3 s
duration, 32 or 44 ma) was applied to both corneas and an
occurrence of seizure was defined as appearance of immobility or stun, forelimb clonus, twitching of the vibrissae,
and an elevated (or straub) tail (barton et al., 2001).
rat amygdala-kindling model
eight-week-old male sprague-dawley rats obtained from
slc inc. (shizuoka, japan) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and a tripolar electrode was inserted
into the amygdala complex using stereotaxic surgery. after
a recovery period of 1 week, threshold current of afterdischarge was determined using a 25% ascending stimulation
paradigm. rats were stimulated at the threshold current
once daily until three or more consecutive stage 5 seizures
were observed. animals that showed stable threshold current of afterdischarge for at least three consecutive stimulations were selected for further experiments.
threshold current of afterdischarge was determined using
an ascending stimulation schedule prior to administration of
either  xxxd2881xxx  or vehicle. a second threshold determination was performed 1 h following oral administration of
 xxxd2881xxx  (1, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle. afterdischarge duration, motor seizure duration (time with stage
4 and 5 seizure), and seizure severity (racine severity scale)
were then determined in each rat using a stimulus that was
two steps (or 50%) stronger than the afterdischarge threshold current.
rotarod test
six-week-old male sprague-dawley rats and 8-week-old
male icr mice were obtained from charles river japan inc.
animals were dosed orally with  xxxd2881xxx  (2, 4, 8, or
16 mg/kg for rats; 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg for mice) or vehicle,
1 h prior to being placed on a rotating rod (rotation speed
6 rpm for rats, 8 rpm for mice), and the time animals were
able to remain on the rod was recorded. experiments were
conducted twice for each animal. animals that failed to
remain on the rotarod for 120 s in both trials were classified
as motor-uncoordinated.
pharmacokinetic parameters
for pharmacokinetic experiments,  xxxd2881xxx  was
administered as follows: to fasted male sprague-dawley
rats (n = 4), intravenously (bolus in 0.25 m hcl in saline) or
orally (in 0.33 m hcl) at 1 mg/kg; to fasted male beagle
dogs (n = 3), intravenously (bolus in 0.1 m hcl in saline) or
orally (in 0.1 m hcl) at 0.1 mg/kg; and to fasted male cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4), intravenously (bolus in 0.1 m hcl
in saline) or orally (in 0.1 m hcl) at 0.03 mg/kg. blood
samples were collected from rats via the jugular vein
(0.25 ml), from dogs via the cephalic vein (1 ml), and from
epilepsia, 52(7):1331–1340, 2011
doi: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03109.x

monkeys via the femoral vein (0.5 ml) using heparinized
syringes. for all species, time points for blood collection
were predose, 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after
intravenous dosing, and 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h
after oral dosing. samples from monkey were also taken at
12 h. plasma was obtained by centrifugation and deproteinized using methanol: 60% perchloric solution (500:1 v/v).
the plasma concentration of  xxxd2881xxx  was determined
by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence (hplc–fl). pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd2881xxx  were calculated by model independent analysis
(winnonlin; pharsight, cary, nc, u.s.a.).
in vitro metabolic stability of  xxxd2881xxx  using liver
microsomes
liver microsomes from human, rat, dog, and monkey
were purchased from xenotech, llc (lenexa, ks, u.s.a.).
microsomes (0.5 mg/ml microsomal protein) were incubated with  xxxd2881xxx  (0.03 lg/ml), edta (0.1 mm), an
nadph-generating system (0.33 mm b-nadp+, 0.8 mm
 xxxd1292xxx , 0.1 unit/ml  xxxd1292xxx  dehydrogenase, 6 mm mgcl2), and phosphate buffer (100 mm;
ph 7.4) for 20 min at 37c, and reactions were terminated
by addition of acetonitrile. the residual concentration of
 xxxd2881xxx  was determined by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (lc–ms/ms) with multiple reaction monitoring operated in the positive ionization mode.
statistical analysis
for in vitro studies, values for ca2+ response and radioligand binding were expressed as mean € sem (standard
error of the mean). ic50 values were determined by regression analyses. in animal studies, ed50 (effective dose causing 50% reduction in seizures), td50 (dose causing 50%
reduction in motor coordination), and 95% cis were calculated by regression analyses. two-way ancova (analysis of
covariance) was used to assess overall effect of treatment,
and dunnett’s post test was used to compare differences
between treatment groups. differences between treatment
groups were considered significant if the p-value was <0.05.

results
effects of  xxxd2881xxx  on agonist-induced increases in
[ca2+]i
rat cortical neurons were used to determine the effects of
 xxxd2881xxx  on  xxxg981xxx  function, as measured by
ampa-induced increases in [ca2+]i.  xxxd2881xxx  inhibited
ampa-induced increases in [ca2+]i in a concentrationdependent manner (ic50 93 nm vs. 2 lm ampa; 95% ci,
40–150 nm) (fig. 2a). the well-characterized, 2,3-benzodiazepine-type, noncompetitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonist
gyki52466 (donevan & rogawski, 1993) inhibited
ampa-induced increases in [ca2+]i in cultured rat cortical
neurons with an ic50 of 12.5 lm (data not shown).

the effects of  xxxd2881xxx  on nmda receptor activity
induced by nmda (100 lm) were determined in rat cortical
neurons by measuring changes in [ca2+]i.  xxxd2881xxx  inhibited nmda-induced increases in [ca2+]i by 18%, but only
at the highest concentration tested (30 lm) (fig. 2b). in
contrast, the noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist
mk801 (1 lm) markedly inhibited nmda-induced
increases in [ca2+]i by approximately 85% (fig. 2b).

effect of  xxxd2881xxx  on audiogenic, mes-induced, and
ptz-induced seizures in mice
 xxxd2881xxx  protected mice from tonic–clonic generalized
seizures in audiogenic and mes-induced seizure tests, and
from absence or myoclonic seizures in ptz-induced seizure
tests (table 1).  xxxd2881xxx  ed50 values for seizure protection were lower than corresponding values for the traditional
aeds carbamazepine and sodium valproate (table 1).

6 hz electroshock-induced seizure model
 xxxd2881xxx , given orally 1 h prior to test, protected
mice from 6 hz electroshock-induced seizures in a
dose-dependent manner (fig. 4). the ed50 value for  xxxd2881xxx  was similar at 32 ma (ed50 2.1 mg/kg; 95% ci,

further reduced the incidence of seizures in the presence of

the effect of  xxxd2881xxx  on motor coordination was
determined using the rotarod test.  xxxd2881xxx  caused

discussion
data presented in this study suggest that  xxxd2881xxx  is an
orally active, noncompetitive, selective  xxxg981xxx 
antagonist with broad spectrum antiseizure activity in preclinical epilepsy models.
in in vitro studies,  xxxd2881xxx  potently inhibited
ampa-induced increases in intracellular [ca2+]i in cultured rat cortical neurons, but did not significantly inhibit
mk801-sensitive nmda-induced ca2+ responses, suggesting that  xxxd2881xxx  is a selective  xxxg981xxx 
antagonist. selectivity of  xxxd2881xxx  for ampa receptors
over nmda receptors may be an important feature clinically, as nmda receptor antagonists are known to produce
psychoactive effects, including schizophrenia-like symptoms and cognitive impairment (meldrum & rogawski,
2007).
although  xxxd2881xxx  inhibited ampa-induced functional responses, [3h] xxxd2881xxx  binding to rat forebrain
membranes was only slightly reduced by high concentrations of ampa or glutamate, and was unaffected by the
competitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonist nbqx. furthermore,  xxxd2881xxx  at a concentration of 1.25 lm did not
inhibit [3h]ampa binding (data not shown). these data
suggest a noncompetitive interaction of  xxxd2881xxx  with
the  xxxg981xxx . in addition,  xxxd2881xxx  binding
was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by the
selective noncompetitive  xxxg981xxx  antagonists
gyki52466 and cp465022, suggesting a common binding

site between  xxxd2881xxx  and these compounds. in line with
these findings, other studies have demonstrated common
binding sites between noncompetitive  xxxg981xxx 
antagonists on the  xxxg981xxx . cp465022 and
gyki53655 are reported to share a binding site at the interface between the glutamate binding core and the channel
region of the  xxxg981xxx  (balannik et al., 2005). binding to this site is thought to stabilize the resting state of the
channel and disrupt channel opening in response to agonist
binding (balannik et al., 2005).
the potential benefits of noncompetitive antagonists over
competitive antagonists with respect to antiseizure activity
are unclear, although noncompetitive antagonists would be
expected to retain their antagonist effects in the presence of
high agonist concentrations, and, therefore, may be more
effective under conditions of increased excitation (yamaguchi et al., 1993). indeed, fritsch et al. (2010) reported superior efficacy of gyki52466 compared with diazepam in an
animal model of status epilepticus (se). similarly, the noncompetitive nmda antagonist mk-801 was more effective
than the competitive antagonist cpp in terminating prolonged experimental se (yen et al., 2004). these results
suggest superiority of noncompetitive antagonists to competitive antagonists in treating severe seizure conditions.
 xxxd2881xxx  displayed a broad spectrum of activity across
preclinical seizure models (table 1). in mouse models of
tonic–clonic generalized seizures (audiogenic and mesinduced seizure tests) and absence/myoclonic seizures
(ptz-induced seizure tests), the potency of  xxxd2881xxx  was
higher than the potency of the traditional aeds carbamazepine and sodium valproate.  xxxd2881xxx  also showed efficacy in the rat amygdala-kindling model of temporal lobe
epilepsy, but did not show activity in genetic absence
epilepsy rats from strasbourg (danober et al., 1998).
therefore,  xxxd2881xxx  shows activity in preclinical models
epilepsia, 52(7):1331–1340, 2011
doi: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03109.x

of both partial and generalized seizures. in the search for
novel aeds, drug effects observed in chronic models of epilepsy, such as the amygdala-kindling model, are considered
to be more predictive of clinical efficacy and toxicity than
effects observed in acute models (lçscher, 2002), potentially leading to fewer false positives. in the current study,
broad spectrum activity of  xxxd2881xxx  is suggested by
activity in both chronic and acute epilepsy models.
in the rat amygdala-kindling model,  xxxd2881xxx 
increased afterdischarge threshold and significantly reduced
motor seizure duration, afterdischarge duration, and seizure
severity. therefore,  xxxd2881xxx  inhibited both secondary
generalized seizures (seizure score ‡4) and focal seizures
(score £3). although most aeds are reported to inhibit
amygdala-kindled seizures, their effects differ significantly.
phenytoin, for example, appears to suppress focal seizures,
but does not inhibit the spread of afterdischarges and the
development of secondary generalized seizures (ebert
et al., 1997). in contrast, some nmda receptor antagonists
have been shown to block only generalized seizures in this
model (barton & white, 2004). ampa antagonists, on the
other hand, block both the focal and generalized components (hara et al., 2006), consistent with characteristic
broad spectrum antiseizure effects of these compounds.
ampa receptors are thought to play a critical role in the
propagation of seizures (namba et al., 1994; rogawski &
donevan, 1999), and are also likely to be involved in their
initial triggering (tortorella et al., 1997). interestingly,
afterdischarge persisted in some  xxxd2881xxx -treated animals despite complete inhibition of behavioral seizures,
suggesting that  xxxd2881xxx  may have a greater inhibitory
effect on propagation of seizures than on their initiation.
seizures induced by 6 hz electroshock are classically
considered resistant to phenytoin and other inhibitors of
voltage-dependent ion channels, with aed activity being

1339
 xxxd2881xxx : a novel ampa-r antagonist
closely linked to the stimulation intensity (barton et al.,
2001). phenytoin and lamotrigine show only a partial inhibitory response when stimulation intensity is increased from
22 to 32 ma in this model, whereas many other aeds lose
effectiveness when stimulation intensity increases further to
44 ma (barton et al., 2001). in a test of seven established
aeds (phenytoin, carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenobarbital,  xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3438xxx , and  xxxd3485xxx ) and
five new generation aeds (lamotrigine,  xxxd2466xxx ,  xxxd2090xxx , tiagabine, and topiramate), only  xxxd2466xxx  and
valproate showed activity in the 6 hz model at 44 ma stimulation intensity, and in both cases, efficacy of the compounds was lower at 44 ma than at 32 ma stimulation
intensity, as shown by higher ed50 values (barton et al.,
2001). in contrast,  xxxd2881xxx  showed similar effectiveness
at 32 and 44 ma stimulation intensities in our studies.
activity in the 6 hz seizure model has been observed for
some newer aeds (bialer & white, 2010), including  xxxd2436xxx , carisbamate, and  xxxd2079xxx , and also appears to be
a characteristic of both competitive and noncompetitive
 xxxg981xxx  antagonists (barton et al., 2003). as yet,
the clinical significance of activity in the 6 hz seizure
model is unknown.
data from the 6 hz electroshock model were also consistent with  xxxd2881xxx  acting synergistically with other
aeds. individually, phenytoin (10 mg/kg) and a low dose
of  xxxd2881xxx  (1 mg/kg) had little effect on 6 hz electroshock seizures, but they almost completely inhibited these
seizures when applied in combination. seizure inhibition
was also enhanced by coadministration of  xxxd2881xxx  with
carbamazepine or valproate. consistent with these observations, synergism between aeds has been described more
frequently in preclinical studies involving  xxxg981xxx 
antagonists than in studies with other aeds (jonker et al.,
2007), suggesting that  xxxg981xxx  antagonists may be
promising candidates for combination therapy. concomitant aeds did not appear to alter behavioral side effects of
 xxxd2881xxx  in our studies, although side effects were not
evaluated using objective methodology.
the therapeutic window for antiseizure effects of  xxxd2881xxx  in rodents appears small due to significant effects on
motor coordination. in both the mouse and rat rotarod tests,
 xxxd2881xxx  showed significant effects on motor coordination close to the concentrations required to reduce seizure
activity. similar effects on motor coordination have been
reported for both noncompetitive (e.g. gyki52466) and
competitive (e.g. nbqx)  xxxg981xxx  antagonists, suggesting a mechanism associated with  xxxg981xxx 
blockade (yamaguchi et al., 1993). the window between
antiseizure effects and motor dysfunction, however, is different across preclinical seizure models, making predictions
of clinical therapeutic index difficult. furthermore, aeds
such as gabapentin and pregabalin cause central nervous
system (cns) depressant effects in patients (arroyo &
lesser, 1993; arroyo et al., 2004) despite preclinical studies

that indicated a very wide therapeutic margin (dalby &
nielsen, 1997; vartanian et al., 2006), whereas valproate
shows a narrow therapeutic margin in rodent models
(barton et al., 2001) but does not show strong cns depressant side effects (mattson et al., 1992). therefore, clinical
therapeutic index of aeds cannot reliably be inferred from
preclinical studies.
the noncompetitive ampa antagonist  xxxd3279xxx  has
already demonstrated efficacy in patients with refractory
partial-onset seizures (chappell et al., 2002), although with
associated adverse events including mild-to-moderate
ataxia and dizziness occurring around plasma peak concentration. pharmacokinetic studies of  xxxd3279xxx  revealed a
short terminal half-life (5.6 h) at steady state (langan et al.,
2003), which led the investigators to adopt a three-timesdaily dosing regimen in the efficacy studies. this regimen
caused repeated plasma peaks of  xxxd3279xxx , which may
have contributed to the adverse event profile. hence, ampa
antagonists with a longer half-life potentially may be beneficial in reducing the incidence and severity of adverse
events. in preclinical animal studies,  xxxd2881xxx  was shown
to have good oral bioavailability across species, and notably
a half-life of 7.55 h in primates. furthermore,  xxxd2881xxx 
was much more stable in the presence of human liver microsomes than in the presence of microsomes from nonhuman
animal species, suggesting that the half-life of  xxxd2881xxx 
may be even longer in humans. this may offer advantages
for  xxxd2881xxx  over  xxxd3279xxx , since a less frequent dosing
regimen may be possible, with a consequently smoother
drug concentration profile and potentially fewer adverse
events.
in conclusion, we report here on a novel anticonvulsant,
 xxxd2881xxx , which demonstrates potent, noncompetitive
 xxxg981xxx  antagonist activity with selectivity over
nmda receptors in vitro. the antiseizure activity of  xxxd2881xxx  in various preclinical models of epilepsy is consistent
with its activity as an  xxxg981xxx  antagonist, and supports its further development as an orally active, broad spectrum antiepileptic agent.  xxxd2881xxx  has potential as a
treatment in patients whose seizures are refractory to other
aeds, and may be effective either alone or as add-on therapy with other aeds.
