of a pore-forming ␣1 subunit together with several accessory subunits,
including ␣2␦, ␤, and, in some cases, ␥ subunits. a family of vdccs
known as the l-type channels are formed specifically from ␣1s
(skeletal muscle), ␣1c (in heart and brain), ␣1d (mainly in brain, heart,
and endocrine tissue), and ␣1f (retina). neuroendocrine l-type currents have a significant role in the control of neurosecretion and can
be inhibited by gtp-binding (g-) proteins. however, the subunit
composition of the vdccs underlying these g-protein–regulated
neuroendocrine l-type currents is unknown. to investigate the biophysical and pharmacological properties and role of g-protein modulation of ␣1d calcium channels, we have examined calcium channel
currents formed by the human neuronal l-type ␣1d subunit, coexpressed with ␣2␦-1 and ␤3a, stably expressed in a human embryonic
kidney (hek) 293 cell line, using whole cell and perforated patchclamp techniques. the ␣1d-expressing cell line exhibited l-type currents with typical characteristics. the currents were high-voltage
activated (peak at ⫹20 mv in 20 mm ba2⫹) and showed little
inactivation in external ba2⫹, while displaying rapid inactivation
kinetics in external ca2⫹. the l-type currents were inhibited by the
1,4 dihydropyridine (dhp) antagonists nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx  and
were enhanced by the dhp agonist bayk s-(⫺)8644. however, ␣1d
l-type currents were not modulated by activation of a number of
g-protein pathways. activation of endogenous somatostatin receptor
subtype 2 (sst2) by  xxxg2205xxx  or activation of transiently transfected rat d2 dopamine receptors (rd2long) by quinpirole had no
effect. direct activation of g-proteins by the nonhydrolyzable gtp
analogue, guanosine 5⬘-0-(3-thiotriphospate) also had no effect on the
␣1d currents. in contrast, in the same system, n-type currents, formed
from transiently transfected ␣1b/␣2␦-1/␤3, showed strong g-protein–
mediated inhibition. furthermore, the i–ii loop from the ␣1d clone,
expressed as a glutathione-s-transferase (gst) fusion protein, did not
bind g␤␥, unlike the ␣1b i–ii loop fusion protein. these data show
that the biophysical and pharmacological properties of recombinant
human ␣1d l-type currents are similar to ␣1c currents, and these

currents are also resistant to modulation by gi/o-linked g-protein–
coupled receptors.

introduction

the l-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (vdccs)
are formed by one of four possible pore forming ␣1 subunits:
␣1s (found in skeletal muscle) (tanabe et al. 1987), ␣1c
(mainly cardiac) (mikami et al. 1989), ␣1d (in neurons and
neurosecretory cells and heart) (seino et al. 1992; williams et
al. 1992; wyatt et al. 1997; yaney et al. 1992), or ␣1f (retinal,
not yet functionally expressed) (strom et al. 1998). the vdcc
family nomenclature was recently revised by ertel et al.
(2000): ␣1s, ␣1c, ␣1d, and ␣1f were renamed  xxxg310xxx ,  xxxg304xxx ,
 xxxg305xxx , and  xxxg306xxx , respectively. the ␣1 subunits are coassembled with the accessory subunits ␤, ␣2␦ (and ␥1 in
skeletal muscle). l-type currents have been defined pharmacologically by their sensitivity to low (nm to ␮m) concentrations of 1,4-dihydropyridine (dhp) antagonists (e.g., nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx ) and agonists [e.g., s-(⫺)bayk8644]
(sanguinetti and kass 1984). in addition, l-type channels
exhibit the following biophysical characteristics: “long-lasting” currents that show little inactivation in ba2⫹ (nowycky et
al. 1985); some selectivity for ba2⫹ over ca2⫹ and ca2⫹dependent inactivation (soldatov et al. 1997).
gtp-binding (g-) proteins exist as heterotrimeric complexes, composed of a g␣ subunit and a g␤␥ dimer. on
activation of a g-protein– coupled receptor (gpcr), the heterotrimer dissociates into free g␣-gtp and g␤␥ dimers. it is
these free g␤␥ subunits that are thought to be responsible for
fast, membrane delimited, voltage-dependent g-protein inhibition of certain neuronal vdccs, including ␣1a, ␣1b, and ␣1e
(herlitze et al. 1996; ikeda 1996; page et al. 1998; for a review
see dolphin 1998). vdccs undergoing voltage-dependent gprotein modulation display the following characteristics: a
decrease in whole cell current, depolarizing shift in the currentvoltage (i-v) relationship, and slowed activation kinetics (bean
1989). another characteristic is the loss of g-protein modula-

tion at large depolarizations (bean 1989); consequently a large
depolarizing prepulse immediately before a test pulse transiently removes inhibition, and the activation kinetics become
faster, a phenomenon termed prepulse facilitation (bean 1989;
elmslie et al. 1990).
native cardiac l-type channels have long been known to
exhibit g-protein-induced stimulation via g␣s and a campdependent protein kinase pathway (reuter 1983). recently
stimulation of smooth muscle l-type currents by g␤␥ has also
been reported via a phosphinositide 3 kinase pathway (viard et
al. 1999). inhibition via activation of g␣i/o, and subsequent
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, is another g-protein modulatory
path that regulates cardiac l-type channels (fischmeister and
hartzell 1986). in native endocrine and neurosecretory cells
and cell lines, g-protein inhibition of l-type currents has also
been observed (degtiar et al. 1997; gilon et al. 1997; haws et
al. 1993; hernandez-guijo et al. 1999; kleuss et al. 1991;
mathie et al. 1992; tallent et al. 1996). this is thought to be
involved in the inhibitory modulation of secretion. however,
the subtype(s) of vdcc ␣1 subunit(s) involved and type of
g-protein modulation observed for these l-type currents have
not been fully defined (see dolphin 1999, for review). in
neuronal and neurosecretory tissue, l-type currents are formed
from ␣1d as well as ␣1c subunits (chin et al. 1992). ␣1d has
also been shown to be expressed in heart (hell et al. 1993;
wyatt et al. 1997). the consensus of current research suggests
that l-type currents resulting from expression of neuronal
(bourinet et al. 1996; canti et al. 1999) or cardiac (meza and
adams 1998) ␣1c isoforms do not exhibit the voltage-dependent g-protein inhibition that is typical of n or p/q currents.
nevertheless, in experiments where cloned ␣1c has been coexpressed with accessory subunits in xenopus laevis oocytes
(oz et al. 1998) and hek 293 cells (dai et al. 1999; kamp et
al. 2000), other forms of facilitation and second-messenger–
based inhibition have been observed.
the existence of g-protein modulation of cloned ␣1d l-type
vdccs has not yet been examined. here we have used a stable
hek 293 cell line expressing the human ␣1d subunit, together
with the human accessory subunits ␣2␦-1 and ␤3a, to establish
the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the expressed current and whether the resultant current shows gprotein modulation.
methods

materials
the following compounds were stored at ⫺20°c (stock concentration in mm unless stated, solvent, and source): nifedipine, nif (3,
ethanol, sigma, st. louis, mo);  xxxd2718xxx , nic (3, ethanol, sigma);
bayk s-(⫺)8644, bayk (3, ethanol, rbi, natwick, ma);  xxxg2205xxx , sst (0.1, deoxygenated double-distilled water, rbi, natwick,
ma); quinpirole, quin (10, double-distilled water, rbi);  xxxd1742xxx 
(10,  xxxd1896xxx , sigma);  xxxd2191xxx   xxxd2191xxx  sulfate (100 mg/ml,
double-distilled water, life technologies, paisley, scotland); zeocin
(100 mg/ml, supplied in solution form, invitrogen, carlsbad, ca); and
 xxxd164xxx  (80 mg/ml,  xxxd1896xxx , sigma).
the following cdnas were used in transient transfections: rabbit
␣1b (genbank accession number d14157), rat ␣1e (rbeii, l15453),
rat ␣1e long (see below for details), rat ␤1b (tomlinson et al. 1993), rat
␤3 (m88571), rat ␣2␦-1 (neuronal splice variant, m86621), rat d2long
receptor (rd2long, x17458, n5 3 g), and mut-3 green fluorescent
protein (gfp, u73901). all cdnas were subcloned into the expres-

817

sion vector prk5 except for the clones used in the ␣1e long transient
transfection study, which were subcloned into the expression vector
pmt2 (genetic institute, cambridge, ma) (see swick et al. 1992).
the rat ␣1e (rbeii, l15453) clone has a truncated n-terminus, compared with other ␣1e clones. page et al. (1998) extended this clone
using a rat ␣1e n-terminal extension (af057029). the resulting
rat ␣1e long clone used in this study has homology to published mouse
(l29346), human (l27745), and rabbit (x67855) ␣1e clones. the ␤1b
subunit used in this study is that of tomlinson et al. (1993). it is
identical to the rat ␤1b clone defined in the genbank database
(x61394) except for two substitutions (r417 3 s and v435 3 a)
and the deletion a431 (t. p. snutch, personal communication).

␣1d stable cell line (hek 293 ␣1d)
standard techniques were used to transfect hek 293 stably with
human neuronal ␣1d (m76558), ␣2b␦-1 (m76559) and ␤3a (not published); for clarity this cell line (#5d12-20) will subsequently be
referred to as hek 293 ␣1d. the cloning of these vdcc subunits is
discussed in williams et al. (1992). the clonal ␣1d cell line was
established by transfecting hek293 cells using a standard ca2⫹
phosphate procedure (brust et al. 1993) with 10, 5, and 5 ␮g of the
␣1d, ␣2b␦-1, and ␤3a expression constructs, respectively. the ␣1d
subunit expression plasmid, pcdna1␣1drbs, does not contain an
antibiotic resistance gene, whereas the ␣2b␦-1 and ␤3a subunit expression plasmids, prc/cmv␣2b␦-1 and pzeocmv␤3a, contain the neomycin and zeocin resistance genes, respectively.  xxxd2191xxx   xxxd2191xxx 
sulfate (final concentration 100 ␮g/ml, life technologies) and zeocin
(final concentration 40 ␮g/ml, invitrogen) were used for selection of
colonies. the selection medium was added to the cells 48 h after
transfection. antibiotic-resistant colonies were transferred to 96-well
plates using cloning cylinders, 2– 4 wk after selection was initiated.
cell lines containing functional channels were selected with a fluo3based calcium flux assay.

cell culture and transfection
the culture medium in which the hek 293 ␣1d and control hek
293 cells were grown consisted of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem) with 4.5-g glucose 䡠 l⫺1 (dmem, life technologies). this was supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum (hyclone,
ut), penicillin (100 iu 䡠 ml⫺1) and streptomycin (100 ␮g 䡠 ml⫺1; life
technologies) and the additional selection antibiotics for the hek
293 ␣1d cell line (as described above). the cells were grown in this
medium at 37°c, 5% co2, and passaged every 2–3 days.
for transient transfection of the ␣1b, ␣2␦-1, ␤3a vdcc subunits
and mut-3 gfp expression marker into hek 293 cells, a mixture was
made containing, respectively, 15, 5, 5, and 1 ␮l of the cdnas (at a
concentration of 1 ␮g/␮l). in experiments where the rd2long was used,
5 ␮g of this cdna was added; in experiments where this  xxxg656xxx 
pathway was not investigated, 5 ␮g of blank prk5 vector was used to
give a final cdna amount of 31 ␮g. the same amounts were used for
the transfection of ␣1e, ␣2␦-1, ␤1b, and mut-3 gfp (using 5 ␮g of
blank pmt2 to make the mixture up to a final amount of 31 ␮g). for
transfection, 10 ␮l of geneporter reagent (genetic therapy systems,
san diego, ca) and 2 ␮l of the cdna mix were added to each 1 ml
of dmem (no supplements) and incubated at 20°c for 1 h before
addition of 1 ml to each 35-mm-diam culture dish containing approximately 2 ⫻ 106 cells. transfected cells were then grown at 37°c for
36 h and subsequently at 28°c for 36 h. this process of 37°c/28°c
incubation was also the standard procedure for the stable ␣1d cell line
before electrophysiological experiments. in experiments on the hek
293 ␣1d cells where additional transient transfection of rd2long expression was required, the cdna mix was formed of rd2long (5 ␮g)
and mut-3 gfp (1 ␮g) cdna, and made up to 31 ␮g with blank
prk5, with the transfection procedure being as described above (for

␣1b and ␣1e). successful transfection was determined by expression
of mut3-gfp.

electrophysiology
the internal (pipette) and external solutions and recording techniques were similar to those previously described (campbell et al.
1995). for whole cell patch-clamp recordings, the patch pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 cs-aspartate, 5 egta, 2 mgcl2, 0.1
cacl2, 2 k2atp, 0.8 trisgtp, 10 hepes; ph 7.2, 310 mosm with
sucrose. in experiments where guanosine 5⬘-0-(3-thiotriphospate)
(gtp-␥s) and guanosine 5⬘-0-(2-thiodiphospate) (gdp-␤s) were
used, the gtp was replaced with either 100 ␮m gtp-␥s (sigma) or
2 mm gdp-␤s (boehringer, mannheim, germany). for perforatedpatch clamp recordings the patch pipette solution contained (in mm)
100 ch3o3scs, 25 cscl, 3 mgcl2, 40 hepes; ph 7. 3, and freshly
supplemented (within 1 h of recording) with 240 ␮g/ml  xxxd164xxx . the external solution contained (in mm) 160 tetraethylammonium (tea) bromide, 3 kcl, 1.0 nahco3, 1.0 mgcl2, 10 hepes, 4
glucose, 10 or 20 bacl2 or cacl2; ph 7. 4, 320 mosm with sucrose.
the perfusion rate was 1–2 ml/min. pipettes of resistance 2–5 m⍀
were used. an axon 200a or an axopatch 1d amplifier (axon
instruments, foster city, ca) was used, and data were filtered at 1
khz and digitized at 5–10 khz using a digidata 1200 interface (axon
instruments). membrane capacitance measurements were recorded
from the amplifier following capacitance compensation. analysis was
performed using pclamp 6.02 (axon instruments) and origin 5
(microcal software, northampton, ma). current records are shown
following leak and residual capacitance current subtraction (p/4 or p/5
protocol). data are expressed as means ⫾ se. statistical analysis was
performed using paired or unpaired student’s t-test, as appropriate,
where significance was defined as p ⬍ 0. 05 (*) and p ⬍ 0. 01 (**).

by gv/gmax (normalized conductance) and v50,inact substituted
by v50,act.
the holding potential was ⫺80 mv, unless otherwise stated. voltages were not corrected for liquid junction potential, measured using
the method described in neher (1995), which were up to ⫺2.7 mv in
whole cell recording solutions and ⫺5.4 mv in perforated-patch
solutions.

construction, expression, and purification of proteins
the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to amplify (from
full length clones) regions of cdna encoding the calcium channel
i–ii loops of the rabbit ␣1b and human ␣1d clones (m76558). as the
full length clone of the human ␣1d was unavailable for pcr, it was
necessary to perform rt-pcr from the hek 293 ␣1d cell line.
approximately 105 hek 293 ␣1d cells were lysed using the
qiashredder and the total rna extracted using the qiagen rneasy
kit (qiagen, crawley, uk). after a further phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation the total rna was reverse transcribed using

mmlv-reverse transcriptase (life technologies, paisley, scotland)
and random hexamer primers (promega, southampton, uk). pcr was
performed using either pfu (promega) or pfx (life technologies)
high-fidelity dna polymerase in the supplied polymerase buffers.
bamhi and ecori restriction sites (underlined) for directional, inframe cloning of the resulting fragments into pgex2t (pharmacia, st.
albans, uk) were present in the primer sets as follows:
␣1b forward: 5⬘ctcaggatcctttgctaaggagcg3⬘
reverse: 5⬘agaagaattctgccttcaccatgc3⬘
␣1d forward: 5⬘gtggatccttctcaaaggaaagag3⬘
reverse: 5⬘aggaattcgtgacagacttcac3⬘
amplification was for 30 cycles before the resulting products were
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with bamhi and
ecori and subcloned into pgex2t (pharmacia). the resulting constructs are gst␣1bi–ii loop and gst␣1di–ii loop, respectively. the
sequences of all the fusion protein constructs were verified by cycle
sequencing (sequitherm, epicentre laboratories, madison, wi) or
automated sequencing, before use in protein expression studies.
expression cultures of bl21(de3)-codon plus-(ril) escherichia
coli (stratagene, amsterdam, nl) were grown overnight at 37°c in
lb medium supplemented with 34 ␮g/ml chloramphenicol, 50 ␮g/ml
ampicillin, and 1% (wt/vol) glucose. the saturated cultures were
diluted 10-fold in the same medium and grown for a further 2.5 h.
before cooling to 25°c and induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-thiogalactopyranoside. induced cultures were grown at 25°c for a further
2.5 h before harvesting. all further purification steps were performed
at 4°c. cells were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline,
ph 7.4 (pbs: 10 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, 137 mm nacl, 2.7
mm kcl) containing 1% sarcosyl, 25 mm edta, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 tablet per 50 ml of lysate, complete
edta-free, roche diagnostics, lewes, uk) followed by a 10-min
incubation at 4°c. tritonx-100 was then added to a final concentration of 2% and the lysate re-sonicated and incubated at 4°c for a
further 10 min. before centrifugation at 20,000 ⫻ g for 15 min at 4°c.
the resulting supernatant was then applied to a 1-ml gstrap column
(pharmacia) and the column washed with 10 column volumes of
binding buffer (pbs, ph 7.4 containing 0.1% triton x100, 20 mm
edta, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 protease inhibitor tablet per 200
ml). bound gst-fusion proteins were then eluted from the column
with elution buffer (binding buffer, at ph 8.0, supplemented with 5
mm  xxxd2213xxx ). glutathione was removed from the fusion
protein preparations by dialysis against hbs-ep buffer [10 mm
hepes, ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl, 3 mm edta, 0.005% (vol/vol)
tween 20] before samples were frozen in aliquots at ⫺20°c.
bovine brain g-proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity
using conventional chromatographic techniques. g␤␥ dimers were
then liberated from g␣ subunits in the presence of aluminum fluoride
(exner et al. 1999). isolation and final purification of g␤␥ was
achieved using a mono q fplc column (pharmacia). g␤␥ subunits
were identified by their immunoreactivity and stored in aliquots at
⫺80°c until required for use.
a full-length ␤1b with c-terminal hexa-histidine tag (h6c␤1b) was
produced by pcr (10 cycles) using pfu polymerase (stratagene,
amsterdam), ␤1b in pmt2 as template and the following primers:
forward: 5⬘gggaattcatggtccagaagagcg3⬘
reverse: 5⬘ gggaattctcaatgatgatgatgatgatggcggatctacacg 3⬘
the resulting pcr product (approximately 1.9k.b.) was digested
with ecori and subcloned into the pkk233–3 vector (amersham
pharmacia, little chalfont, uk). to maximize yields of the fulllength h6c␤1b protein the 600b.p. 3⬘ ncoi-ecori fragment of
h6c␤1b and the 1.3k.b. 5⬘ncoi-ncoi fragment of ␤1b were subcloned
into ncoi-ecori digested pet28b (novagen, nottingham, uk) to
give h6c␤1b-pet28b. bl21(de3)-codon plus-(irl) escherichia
coli (stratagene) were transformed with h6c␤1b-pet28b, and cultures were grown overnight to saturation at 37°c in lb (ph 5.5)
supplemented with kanamycin (30 ␮g/ml), chloramphenicol (34 ␮g/

ml) and 1% wt/vol glucose, diluted 1:10 with the same media and
grown for a further 3 h before cooling to room temperature and
induction with 0.5 mm isopropylthio-␤-d-galactoside (iptg). the
cultures were grown for 3 h postinduction at room temperature then
harvested by centrifugation, pellets were stored at ⫺70°c until required.
escherichia coli pellets containing expressed h6c␤1b protein were
lysed at 4°c by sonication in 20 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4),
containing 1 protease inhibitor tablet per liter of culture pelleted. solid
nacl was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 1 m before the
lysate was cleared at 20,000 ⫻ g at 4°c for 15 min. imidazole solution
(ph 7.4) was then added to the resulting supernatant to give a final
concentration of 40 mm before loading onto a nickel-primed 5 ml
hitrap chelating column (amersham pharmacia) equilibrated with
loading buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, 1 m nacl, 40 mm
imidazole, 0.15% wt/vol octylglucoside and 1 protease inhibitor tablet
per 100 ml). the column was washed thoroughly with wash buffer (as
load buffer but 70 mm imidazole) before h6c␤1b was eluted from the
column in elution buffer (as load buffer but 200 mm imidazole).
peak uv280 absorbance fractions were rapidly buffer exchanged on
a sephadex g-25 (amersham pharmacia) column into iex buffer (20
mm 2-[n-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid, ph 6.0, 1 protease inhibitor tablet per 200 ml) supplemented with 500 mm nacl, before
dilution 1:10 with iex buffer. the diluted sample was loaded onto a
1 ml sp-sepahrose hp column (amersham pharmacia), the column
was washed with iex buffer before h6c␤1b proteins were eluted in a
linear gradient of 0 to 1 m nacl in iex buffer. fractions containing
h6c␤1b were identified by sds-page analysis, with coomassie blue
staining, before dialysis against storage buffer (20 mm borate, ph 8.0,
500 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 protease inhibitor tablet per 200 ml).
h6c␤1b prepared in this manner was found to have a half-life in
excess of 60 days at 4°c as judged by sds-page and coomassie
blue staining.

surface plasmon resonance binding assay
all assays were performed on a biacore 2000 (biacore ab, uppsala, sweden) at 25°c in hbs-ep buffer (10 mm hepes, ph 7.4; 150
mm nacl, 3 mm edta, 0.005% vol/vol polysorbate 20) unless
stated otherwise.  xxxg1073xxx  (gst) fusion proteins
were immobilized on cm5 dextran chips using an anti-gst monoclonal antibody kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (biacore ab). to obtain identical molar loadings of the different molecular mass fusion proteins, the following resonance unit (ru)
correction factors were used during immobilization (gst ⫽ 1,
gst␣1di–ii loop ⫽ 1.52, gst␣1bi–ii loop ⫽ 1.57). g␤␥ dimers
were diluted in hbs-ep buffer before use, and g␤␥ injections were

␣1d sensitivity to dhps
from electrophysiological recording of the hek 293 ␣1d
(␣1d /␣2␦-1/␤3a) cell line, 43% of cells were found to express
calcium channel currents, and for those currents that were
stable, the mean current density was ⫺10 ⫾ 2.1 pa/pf
(mean ⫾ se, n ⫽ 21) in 20 mm ba2⫹ at a test potential of ⫹10
mv (and approximately half this value when recorded in 10
mm ba2⫹). as expected, the ␣1d currents displayed sensitivity
to dhp antagonists. the effects of 3 and 10 ␮m nifedipine are
shown in the time course in fig. 1a, and the percentage
inhibition of iba by 3 ␮m nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx  is shown

819

in the bar chart in fig. 1b. the 1,4-dhp antagonist block was
also characterized by an increase in the inactivation kinetics of
iba during the test depolarization (⫹10 mv, vt), which can be
observed by comparing the inhibition at peak compared with
the end of the 200-ms test pulse (e and f, respectively, in fig.
1a, and 䊐 and ■ in fig. 1b). however, ␣1d iba showed very
similar inhibition by nifedipine at three different holding potentials (vh ⫽ ⫺80, ⫺50, and ⫺30 mv). at vh ⫽ ⫺50 mv, 3
␮m nifedipine inhibited ␣1d iba by 62 ⫾ 7% (at peak) and
94 ⫾ 3% (at the end of 200 ms pulse, n ⫽ 5); at vh ⫽ ⫺30 mv
the inhibition was similar, being 56 ⫾ 7% (at peak) and 91 ⫾
3% (at 200 ms, n ⫽ 6).
the agonist bayk s-(⫺)8644 (3 ␮m) produced a marked
enhancement of the current (325 ⫾ 25% increase, n ⫽ 5, at
vt ⫽ ⫹10 mv in 10 mm ba2⫹; 680 ⫾ 84% increase, n ⫽ 14,
at vt ⫽ ⫹10 mv in 20 mm ba2⫹; fig. 1c). the onset of
enhancement was rapid (reaching steady-state enhancement
within 1–2 min of application, fig. 1c) and was accompanied
by a characteristic hyperpolarizing shift in the i-v relationship
(fig. 1d). in some recordings bayk s-(⫺)8644 enhanced ␣1d
currents also displayed the characteristic slowing of tail current
deactivation (for an example, see the enhanced current trace in
fig. 6b).
biophysical characteristics of the ␣1d current
the activation and steady-state inactivation of ␣1d currents
are shown in fig. 2a. fitting the current activation gave a
v50,act of ⫹1.8 ⫾ 1.2 mv. examining the steady-state inactivation properties of the ␣1d currents showed that at test potentials up to ⫹30 mv the ␣1d currents did not fully inactivate
and had a relatively depolarized v50,inact of ⫺13. 4 ⫾ 1.8 mv
(n ⫽ 6). the inactivation kinetics at vt ⫽ ⫹10 mv were very
slow in ba2⫹ (see examples of control traces in fig. 1, a, c,
and d). single exponentials were fitted to the inactivating
phase during long (1,200 –1,600 ms) depolarizing steps, (e.g.,
the white line in the example trace shown in fig. 2b). the ␶inact
was 439 ⫾ 50 ms (n ⫽ 4). the inactivation kinetics with
external ca2⫹ rather than ba2⫹ were far more rapid, shown by
the overlaid example traces in fig. 2c. almost complete inactivation was observed during a 200-ms depolarizing pulse in
ca2⫹ (␶inact ⫽ 44.3 ⫾ 1.1 ms, n ⫽ 7). additionally, the peak
current in 20 mm ca2⫹ was smaller than in 20 mm ba2⫹ (ica
was ⬃20% of iba). the mean i-v relationship in 20 mm
ba2⫹ and 20 mm ca2⫹ exemplifies these differences (fig. 2d).

␣1d currents do not show g-protein–mediated inhibition
having established some basic biophysical and pharmacological properties of ␣1d currents, we then examined whether
these currents displayed g-protein modulation. initially the
modulation of the ␣1d currents was compared with that of ␣1b
currents (known to be g-protein modulated), transiently expressed in hek 293 cells, by activating the endogenous somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2). application of somatostatin
(sst, 100 –500 nm, n ⫽ 8) had no effect on the ␣1d current
(fig. 3a). using the same endogenous receptor-based signaling
pathway, application of sst (500 nm) caused a rapid inhibition of ␣1b currents, observed in all cells tested (see fig. 3b;
mean inhibition, 40 ⫾ 7%, n ⫽ 8).

are denoted by the horizontal bars. the inset shows example traces taken from the time course for control (ctrl, 10 mm ba2⫹)

of current-voltage (i-v) traces in control (20 mm ba2⫹; ctrl) and during s(⫺)-bayk8644 (3 ␮m; bayk) enhancement of the
current. i-v families were formed by depolarizing from ⫺80 mv to between ⫺40 and ⫹60 mv in 10-mv increments, every 5 s
(see pulse protocol below the ctrl family of traces). for clarity example traces are shown for currents measured by stepping to
⫺40, ⫺20, 0, and ⫹20 mv only. in each condition, peak current was measured and plotted as an i-v relationship (bottom; ctrl,
■; with bayk, ●) and fitted by a modified boltzmann equation (eq. 1, see methods).

contents of the cell can be disrupted, resulting in loss of normal
signaling pathways within the cell. such “wash out” effects can
be minimized by using the perforated-patch clamp technique
(horn and marty 1988). to ensure that the loss of g-protein
modulation was not due to such wash out,  xxxd164xxx 
perforated patches were also used; however, no modulation of
␣1d currents by sst was observed at any test potential (n ⫽ 5,
fig. 3c). i-v relationship pulse protocols were performed
during control, sst perfusion and wash conditions in a perforated patch-clamp recording (example traces from these i-v
relationships are shown at the bottom of fig. 3c). the results
exemplify the lack of effect of sst with almost identical
values for v50,act (ctrl ⫽ ⫺6.1 mv; sst ⫽ ⫺6.6 mv;
wash ⫽ ⫺5.7 mv) and k (ctrl ⫽ 8.6 mv; sst ⫽ 8.2 mv;
wash ⫽ 8.4 mv).
to examine another g-protein– coupled receptor pathway,
the rd2long receptor was transiently co-expressed with gfp as
an expression marker in the ␣1d cell line and was also transiently co-expressed with ␣1b/␣2␦-1/␤3 in hek293 cells.

however, application of the d2 agonist quinpirole (300 nm),
had no effect on ␣1d currents (n ⫽ 7, fig. 4a), although a clear
inhibitory effect was observed in 10/16 of the ␣1b/␣2␦-1/␤3
expressing cells (with a mean inhibition of 59 ⫾ 7%, n ⫽ 10;
fig. 4b). this inhibition was greater than that produced by
activation of the endogenous  xxxg2207xxx , suggesting more
efficient activation of this g-protein pathway by d2 receptors,
but despite this, no inhibition of ␣1d currents was observed
(fig. 4c).
the gtp analogue gtp-␥s can be used as a more direct
way of activating g-proteins since it is nonhydrolyzable and
leads to their sustained activation. conversely, the gdp analogue gdp-␤s can be used to block g-protein activation.
using these guanine nucleotide analogues, the existence of
tonic modulation was examined with a prepulse (pp) protocol.

itation, and the activation ttp 90%, were unaltered by inclusion
of gtp-␥s or gdp-␤s.
in comparison, in recordings made from cells transfected
with ␣1b channels, there was no evidence of prepulse facilitation of ␣1b currents using control intracellular pipette solution.
however, following direct activation of g-proteins with
gtp-␥s (fig. 5c), there was a marked facilitation of the ⫹pp
current compared with the no pp current. under these recording conditions, the ttp 90% was also greater in the no pp
current than in the current preceded by a prepulse, whereas in
control conditions this was not apparent (fig. 5d).
g-protein modulation of calcium currents can be also identified by a decrease in the current amplitude and a depolarizing
shift of the i-v relationship with intracellular gtp-␥s, while
opposite effects (increase in current density and hyperpolarizing shift of the i-v relationship) are seen with gdp-␤s (due to
removal of tonic g-protein modulation). however, in the hek

␣1d currents are also resistant to g-protein modulation in

in a recent study by hernandez-guijo et al. (1999), a form of

with or without the additional inclusion of catecholamines. in
fig. 6, we investigated whether there was any g-protein modulation of the ␣1d currents during bayk s-(⫺)8644 perfusion.

search has shown that the selectivity of dhp antagonists for
l-type channels may not be as absolute as previously thought
(diochot et al. 1995; furukawa et al. 1999). to further examine this possibility of ␣1e channels providing a g-protein–
modulated, 1,4-dhp–sensitive current, we investigated currents resulting from transient expression of ␣1e long/␣2␦-1/␤1b.
it was observed that these ␣1e currents were inhibited by both
nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx  (10 ␮m), although the onset of
inhibition is slower than for inhibition of ␣1d currents (data not
shown). the % inhibition was compared at the peak of the
current and at the end of the 200-ms depolarizing test pulse.
for nifedipine, there was 13 ⫾ 4% inhibition of the peak
current and 32 ⫾ 9% inhibition at 200 ms (n ⫽ 9). for
 xxxd2718xxx , there was 63 ⫾ 5% inhibition of the peak current
and 87 ⫾ 7% inhibition at 200 ms (n ⫽ 3). thus the increased
inactivation that was associated with 1,4-dhp inhibition of
␣1d currents is also apparent for these ␣1e currents.

to examine biochemically the basis for the lack of g-protein
modulation of the ␣1d vdcc, the cytoplasmic loops between

clones used in this study were expressed in escherichia coli as
gst fusion proteins and purified as described in methods. the
purified fusion proteins are shown after separation on 12.5%
sds-page gels (fig. 7a). the proteins were bound via the
gst moiety to the biacore 2000 cm5 sensor chip, as described, and gst itself was used as a control. purified bovine
brain g␤␥ subunits were then applied to the sensor chip
surface at a rate of 50 ␮l/min, for 5 min. the sensorgram traces

the kd for g␤␥ binding was calculated to be 62.2 nm. this is
very similar to the kd determined previously for g␤␥ binding
to parts of the ␣1a i–ii loop (de waard et al. 1997).
as a positive control for the integrity of the gst fusion
proteins, the ability of purified h6c␤1b (fig. 7a) to bind to the
same i–ii loops was examined. both ␣1d and ␣1b i–ii loops
bound h6c␤1b reversibly (fig. 7c), with the ␣1d i–ii loop
demonstrating a higher binding affinity with a kd of 10 nm
compared with 21 nm for ␣1b, determined as above, using the
biacore kinetic analysis software with 1:1 interaction.
discussion

l-type current characteristics exhibited by expression of the
human neuronal ␣1d clone
there are a number of key characteristics shown by the
calcium channel currents expressed by the hek 293 ␣1d cells
that are acknowledged as being traits of l-type currents. sensitivity to the dhp antagonists (nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx ) and
an agonist [bayk s-(⫺)8644] were observed. the degree of
inhibition and enhancement are comparable with other studies
investigating the pharmacology of expressed cloned l-type
channels (tomlinson et al. 1993; williams et al. 1992). in
addition, the increased inactivation observed during dhp antagonist application that has been reported previously for native cardiac l-type channels (lee and tsien 1983) was also
apparent for the ␣1d currents. this effect of dhp antagonists
on the inactivation kinetics was recently investigated by handrock et al. (1999), who suggested that it is due to a second
dhp binding site. however, care must be taken when using the
characteristics of antagonism by dhps, since, as was observed
by the application of nifedipine and  xxxd2718xxx  to cells transiently expressing ␣1e channels in this study, ␣1e channels also
exhibit inhibition by dhp antagonists (stephens et al. 1997),
including the characteristic increase in inactivation (compare
peak inhibition with that at 200 ms into the depolarizing
prepulse). more selective pharmacological definition of l-type
over ␣1e or other non–l-type currents might be obtained by
using low micromolar concentrations of nifedipine (rather than

the more promiscuous  xxxd2718xxx ; an effect also observed in
oocytes) (furukawa et al. 1999). however, in the present study,
10 ␮m nifedipine was required to completely inhibit ␣1d
currents. enhancement by bayk s-(⫺)8644 remains a defining
characteristic of l-type currents, since ␣1e currents have previously been shown to be insensitive to bayk s-(⫺)8644
(stephens et al. 1997).
many of the biophysical characteristics expected of l-type
currents are also observed for the ␣1d currents. the i-v relationship in fig. 2d shows that the currents activate at about
⫺20 mv and with the peak at approximately ⫹20 mv in 20
mm ba2⫹, as also observed for other native l-type channels,
and for ␣1c currents (lacinova et al. 1995). however, native

␣1d currents observed in inner hair cells were shown to have
i-v relationships approximately 20 mv negative to the i-v
relationship observed in this study (platzer et al. 2000); this
difference may be partially accounted for by the lower external
ba2⫹ concentration used (10 mm). they also exhibit the ion
selectivity (ba2⫹ ⬎ ca2⫹) typical of other native and cloned
l-type channels (kalman et al. 1988), with current density in
20 mm ba2⫹ being approximately five-fold greater than that
seen for 20 mm ca2⫹. the activation observed for the ␣1d
currents expressed in this study (v50,act of ⫹1.8 mv; see fig.
2a) is very similar to expressed cardiac (pérez-garcı́a et al.
1995) and neuronal (tomlinson et al. 1993) ␣1c l-type channel currents. the steady-state inactivation (v50,inact of ⫺13.9
mv; see fig. 2a), is also comparable to expressed cardiac ␣1c
l-type currents (lacinova et al. 1995). the inactivation kinetics are also typical of “long-lasting” neuronal l-type currents
(nowycky et al. 1985). in 20 mm ba2⫹, very little inactivation
of ␣1d currents was observed, while rapid and striking calcium-dependent inactivation was observed in 20 mm ca2⫹
(see fig. 2, b–d).
another characteristic of the ␣1d currents that correlates
well with other studies of expressed ␣1c channels (dai et al.
1999; kamp et al. 2000) is the small but reproducible facilitation following a large depolarizing prepulse (see fig. 5).
such attributes are often indicative of g-protein modulation;
however, for the ␣1d current this effect was independent of
g-protein modulation, as it was similar in the presence of
gtp-␥s and gdp-␤s.
as yet there are no biophysical characteristics or pharmacological tools that can differentiate between currents resulting
from either native or expressed ␣1c and ␣1d channels. previous
research has shown that the block by dhp antagonists is
voltage dependent, with greater inhibition being observed
when the holding potential is more depolarized (sanguinetti
and kass 1984). however, for the ␣1d currents no such voltage
dependence of block by dhp antagonists was observed, with
similar block occurring (at both peak current and 200 ms) at all
holding potentials examined. another aspect that may prove to
be different is the ␶inact of ␣1d currents in ba2⫹. in a previous
study examining the ␶inact of ␣1c when co-expressed with ␤3 in
xenopus laevis oocytes (soldatov et al. 1997), slower rates of

l-type (␣1d) calcium channel properties and modulation

inactivation were observed (⬃1,300 ms) than seen here for ␣1d
currents. nevertheless, care must be taken in interpreting such
results since expression system (oocyte vs. hek 293) and
specific accessory subunit composition (particularly ␤ subunits) will have marked effects on the inactivation properties.
lack of g-protein modulation of ␣1d currents
the preceding biophysical and pharmacological characterization clearly defined the ␣1d currents as being l-type in
nature. we then investigated the possibility of g-protein modulation of this l-type current. g-protein modulation was examined either by activation of the endogenous sst2 receptors or
by transient expression of another gpcr, the rd2long receptor.
however, no modulation was observed of ␣1d currents via
either pathway. to ensure that the g-protein pathways were
intact and capable of coupling to calcium channels in the hek
293 cells, both the endogenous sst2 and the transiently expressed exogenous rd2long receptors were stimulated via their
respective agonists in hek 293 cells expressing ␣1b currents,
which have been shown to be g-protein modulated by many
groups (for review, see dolphin 1998). these positive controls
showed obvious g-protein modulation, confirming that modulation is possible by these pathways. furthermore, the modulation of the ␣1d current was also investigated during application of bayk s-(⫺)8644, since g-protein–mediated inhibition
of l-type currents had been observed in native rat chromaffin
cells, during enhancement by bayk s-(⫺)8644 (hernandezguijo et al. 1999). however, a combination of bayk
s-(⫺)8644, sst, and quinpirole did not reveal inhibitory gprotein modulation of bayk s-(⫺)8644 – enhanced ␣1d currents co-expressed with rd2long (see fig. 6).
another method to examine g-protein modulation is to use
the nonhydrolyzable gtp and gdp analogues gtp-␥s and
gdp-␤s. the advantage of using these guanine nucleotide
analogues is that they act directly on all g-proteins, producing
sustained activation (in the case of gtp-␥s) or blockade of
activation (gdp-␤s) (dolphin and scott 1987). using a standard large depolarizing (⫹120 mv) prepulse protocol to detect
g-protein modulation, no gtp-␥s– dependent effect was observed on ␣1d currents, yet the ␣1b currents do exhibit marked
tonic g-protein modulation in these conditions.
the lack of g-protein modulation of this ␣1d clone is
corroborated by the lack of g␤␥ binding to a gst fusion
protein of the ␣1d i–ii loop, whereas in parallel experiments,
reversible binding of g␤␥ was observed to the ␣1b i–ii loop.
in contrast, both the ␣1d and ␣1b i–ii loops reversibly bound
purified ␤1b subunit, indicating that they are probably folded in
a native conformation (see fig. 7c). while the i–ii loop is not
the only region of the ␣1b calcium channel that is involved in
its g-protein regulation (canti et al. 1999; page et al. 1998;
zhang et al. 1996), nevertheless it is certainly one of the key
sequences contributing to the inhibition of neuronal calcium
channels (de waard et al. 1997).
gs-protein modulation of l-type currents was also investigated by activation of the gs- xxxg67xxx  pathway with
 xxxd1742xxx . no effect of  xxxd1742xxx  was observed (n ⫽ 4, data not
shown).  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) modulation of channels has
been shown to require a-kinase anchoring proteins (akaps)
(johnson et al. 1997). the presence of akaps was not examined in this study, although they are likely to be present since

825

they are found in tsa-201 cells which are an hek 293– derived
cell line (johnson et al. 1997).
from these results, the ␣1d l-type clone used in the present
study does not appear to be the molecular counterpart of the
native neuronal and endocrine l-type channels that have been
shown to exhibit g-protein modulation in several neuroendocrine preparations (degtiar et al. 1997; gilon et al. 1997; haws
et al. 1993; hernandez-guijo et al. 1999; kleuss et al. 1991;
tallent et al. 1996).
source of g-protein–modulated neuroendocrine
l-type current?
since we have shown that the ␣1d/␣2␦-1/␤3a currents do not
exhibit inhibitory g-protein modulation, what is the molecular
counterpart of the native l-type current in neuroendocrine cells
that do exhibit g-protein modulation? l-type currents are
generally identified by their sensitivity to dhp antagonists;
however, we previously demonstrated dhp antagonist block of
a rat ␣1e isoform, rbeii (stephens et al. 1997). because this
isoform has a 50 amino acid truncation of the n-terminus
compared with ␣1e clones from other species (page et al.
1998), and may therefore not represent a native isoform in rat
brain (schramm et al. 1999), we have now confirmed and
extended the finding of dhp sensitivity of ␣1e currents, using
␣1elong, an isoform whose extended n-terminus is homologous
to the cloned human (l27745), rabbit (x67855), and mouse
(l29346) (williams et al. 1994) ␣1e sequences. the partial
dhp sensitivity (particularly to  xxxd2718xxx ) of ␣1e currents
observed, as well as the dhp sensitivity of other cloned
non–l-type currents observed recently (furukawa et al. 1999)
suggests the caveat that some studies apparently demonstrating
g-protein modulation of “l-type” currents (according to their
sensitivity to dhp antagonists) may need to be reviewed.
however, this uncertainty over identification of l-type currents
by dhp antagonist sensitivity may only be relevant to a few
studies, and the significant bank of evidence for g-protein
modulation of neuroendocrine l-type channels will be unaffected, particularly those studies in which l-type currents have
been defined by s(⫺)-bayk8644 enhancement (hernandezguijo et al. 1999).
additional ␣1d isoforms have been cloned from pancreatic
␤-cells in rat (ihara et al. 1995) and hamster (yaney et al.
1992). there is little functional expression data available for
these clones. expression of ␣1d clones appears to be problematic with relatively low current density yields (even in the clone
used in this study, a low percentage of cells exhibited stable
currents), a problem that has hindered research in this area and
may indicate that the full-length clones currently available are
not naturally occurring splice variants. a number of sequences
within the ␣1a, ␣1b, and ␣1e vdcc subunits have been shown
to be important for g␤␥ binding and modulation of the channel.
these important ␣1 vdcc subunit sequences include the intracellular loop between domains i and ii (de waard et al.
1997), a region within the n-terminus (canti et al. 1999; page
et al. 1998) and the c-terminus (qin et al. 1997; zhang et al.
1996). two particularly relevant motifs present in the i–ii loop
(qqier) (zamponi et al. 1997) and the n-terminus (ykqsiaqrart) (canti et al. 1999) of ␣1b are not conserved in the
␣1d clone used here. furthermore, when comparing sequence
alignments of the pancreatic ␤-cell ␣1d clones with the neu-

bell et al.

ronal ␣1d clone used in this study, most elements in putative
regions pertinent to g-protein modulation are homologous to
each other. this suggests that these additional published ␣1d
clones may also be predicted to exhibit no g-protein modulation. indeed, similar results have been obtained regarding the
lack of inhibitory g-protein modulation of another ␣1d clone
(yaney et al. 1992) (a. scholze, t. d. plant, a. c. dolphin,
and b. nürnberg, unpublished results). however, the ␣1d sequences show least conservation in the c-terminal tails, with
either long (as in the ␣1d clone used here) or short c-terminus
isoforms (as in yaney et al. 1992) providing scope for the
possibility that the c-terminus of alternative ␣1d splice variants may provide a means of g-protein modulation of certain
splice variants.
as further progress is made in the elucidation of neuroendocrine l-type channels, it is becoming clear that a sophisticated level of complexity is likely to exist. for example, in the
gh3 (a rat pituitary derived) cell line alone, several mrna
transcripts encoding splice variants of the ␣1d subunit have
been reported (safa et al. 1998). further complexity of these
channels will be added due to the differing combinations of
accessory subunits. although ␤3 appears to be a significant
accessory subunit associated with neuronal l-type channels
(pichler et al. 1997), nevertheless, ␤4 is also prominently
associated with neuronal l-type channels, and ␤1b and ␤2a are
also associated with a small proportion of the channels (pichler
et al. 1997). between ␤ subunit isoforms there are also splice
variants (for reviews see birnbaumer et al. 1998; castellano
and perez-reyes 1994) that add to the channel subunit complexity. among these combinations of ␣1d splice variants and
accessory subunits, there may be a sub-set that do exhibit the
g-protein modulation observed in native neuroendocrine cells
and derived cell lines. alternatively, an as yet undiscovered
accessory protein may be required for coupling of the neuronal
l-type channels to g-protein inhibitory pathways, or modulation may involve ca2⫹-dependent mechanisms (mathie et al.
1992), a process not investigated in the present study.
