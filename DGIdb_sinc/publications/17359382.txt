summary
background as chronic atopic dermatitis (ad) is associated with activation of circulating and
infiltrating monocytes, monocytes are considered to play a pivotal role in the establishment of
chronic lesions in ad. histamine is an important mediator of inflammatory and allergic
responses. although new immunomodulatory functions of histamine have recently become
apparent, the effect of histamine on the life span of monocytes remains unclear.
objective in the present study, we investigated the effect of histamine on the life span of
human monocytes from normal healthy donors and patients with ad.
methods monocyte apoptosis was induced by serum deprivation,  xxxg764xxx /fas ligation, or
dexamethasone in the presence of histamine, and measured using  xxxg166xxx -and  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide-staining. bcl-2 protein and activated caspase-3 were determined by flow cytometry.we
also examined the effect of soluble, histamine-induced factors produced by monocytes on
apoptosis. furthermore, we examined whether monocytic apoptosis is dependent on the
camp pathway.
results histamine prevented monocytic apoptosis induced by serum deprivation,  xxxg764xxx /fas
ligation, or dexamethasone in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. the inhibitory effects of
histamine on monocytic apoptosis were blocked by an  xxxg1079xxx  antagonist, and mimicked by an
 xxxg1079xxx  agonist. histamine also up-regulated the expression of bcl-2 and  xxxg1388xxx , and inhibited
the activation of caspase-3. the culture supernatants from histamine-treated monocytes
inhibited monocytic apoptosis, which was partly reversed by the removal of il-10. monocytes
cultured with anti-il-10 mab and histamine did not exhibit an inhibitory effect on apoptosis.
the histamine-induced anti-apoptotic effect was attenuated when monocytes were cultured
in the presence of a camp inhibitor.
conclusions these results indicate that the  xxxg1079xxx  signals induced by histamine allow
monocytes to prolong their life span and infiltrate to the site of inflammation. this process
may contribute to the establishment of chronic allergic disorders, such as ad.

introduction
atopic dermatitis (ad) is a chronically recurring inflammatory skin disease that is frequently associated with high
serum ige levels and peripheral eosinophilia [1, 2]. ad is
also characterized by an allergen-specific ige-mediated
delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction [1]. although the
prevalence of ad has increased during the last three
decades, especially in adults, the mechanisms contributing to the chronicity of this inflammatory skin disease
remain unclear. as chronic ad is associated with activation of circulating and infiltrating monocytes [3, 4],
monocytes are considered one of the important cell types

involved in the establishment of chronic lesions. while
unstimulated monocytes rapidly undergo apoptosis, activating signals, such as cytokines and allergen stimulation,
can actually prolong the life span of monocytes [5–8].
indeed, monocytes from patients with chronic ad exhibit
a significantly lower rate of apoptosis in vitro compared
with those from normal individuals [9]. therefore, it has
been suggested that the prolonged life span of monocytes
in inflamed tissues can contribute to the establishment of
chronic inflammation in ad.
histamine is an important chemical mediator of inflammatory and allergic responses. as mast cells are present in
both the dermis and the epidermis in ad skin lesions [10],

324 f. soga et al
it is expected that aggregation of fceri by environmental
allergens (e.g., dust mites and pollen) and subsequent
degranulation of mast cells occur often. in addition, ige
auto-antibodies are frequently detected in the circulation
of severe ad patients [11], suggesting that degranulation
of peripheral blood basophils is also induced. thus, in ad
individuals, monocytes could be exposed to histamine
either in the skin or from the peripheral circulation. in
addition to the well-characterized effects of histamine in
the inflammatory and allergic responses, new immunomodulatory functions of histamine on monocytes, dendritic cells (dcs), and t cells have recently become
apparent [12]. for example, histamine increases the antigen-presenting capacity, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and t-helper type (th1) priming activity of dcs
through both  xxxg1078xxx  and  xxxg1080xxx , whereas histamine suppresses
the antigen-presentation capacity and induces il-10 production through the  xxxg1079xxx  [13–15]. histamine has also been
shown to enhance th1 responses through activation of the
 xxxg1078xxx , whereas both th1 and th2-type responses are
negatively regulated via the  xxxg1079xxx  [16]. histamine protects
natural killer cells from monocyte-derived oxidative damage [17]. however, the effect of histamine on the life
span of monocytes remains unclear.
in this study, we demonstrated that histamine prevents
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner via the  xxxg1079xxx  in
monocytes. it is suggested that these effects of histamine
on monocytes contribute to the establishment of chronic
lesions in ad.

(miltenyi biotec, bergisch gladbach, germany). purified
monocytes were resuspended at 2  106 cells/ml in lowendotoxin rpmi 1640 (biochrom kg, berlin, germany)
containing 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (gibco brl, gaithersburg, ml, usa), and 100 mg/ml polymyxin b in 12  75
mm polypropylene tubes (falcon; bd labware, san jose,
ca, usa) and were cultured at 37 1c under humidified
conditions. in some experiments, 10% fbs (gibco brl)
was added to the culture medium. all plastic ware and
culture reagents used were tested for the presence of
endotoxin with the limulus amebocytes lysate e-toxate
multiple test. endotoxin levels were always o 10 pg/ml.

methods

monocytes were cultured without serum for 24 h with or
without histamine. the supernatants were isolated, and
the cytokines were blocked, as described previously [8].
briefly, il-1b, il-10, il-6 or  xxxg524xxx  were precipitated with
specific mabs or isotype-matched control igg at 37 1c for
30 min, followed by protein g-sepharose incubation at
4 1c for 2 h before they were added to the monocyte
culture.

flow cytometry analysis
the expression of  xxxg166xxx  was determined to quantitatively assess the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (r&d systems). this kit also enabled us to detect late apoptosis by
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) staining. subdiploid cells were
assessed in  xxxd102xxx permeabilized cells, stained with pi,
as described previously [8]. surface phenotypes and
intracellular expression of the bcl-2 family proteins and
activated caspase-3 were examined, as described previously [8]. the relative fluorescence intensity (rfi) was
assessed as follows: rfi = [mean fluorescence intensity
(mfi) (surface molecule)–mfi (control)/mfi (control)].

reagents
rabbit anti-human bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx  ab and fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated ab to active caspase-3 were obtained from bd pharmingen (san diego,
ca, usa). anti- xxxg764xxx /fas mab ch11 (migm) were purchased from immunotech (marseille, france). mabs
against il-1b, il-6, il-10 and  xxxg524xxx  were purchased
from r&d systems (minneapolis, mn usa). rp-8-brcamps was purchased from calbiochem (darmstadt,
germany). histamine,  xxxd3050xxx , cimetidine, thioperamide,  xxxd321xxx , dimaprit dihydrochloride, r-(-)-amethylhistamine and all other reagents were obtained
from sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo, usa), unless
otherwise indicated.

time periods without serum, and the proportion of apoptotic
cells was assessed by flow cytometry by  xxxg166xxx -or pistaining. immediately after isolation, very few apoptotic
cells were detectable, whereas most of the monocytes
underwent apoptosis after 24–72 h without serum (fig.
1a,d). in contrast, pre-treatment with histamine reduced
spontaneous apoptosis as a result of serum deprivation.
this rescue effect was highest at 100 mm and occurred in
a dose-dependent manner. a concentration of 10 mm
histamine was used for the subsequent experiment. this
concentration of histamine is physiologically or pathologically relevant because it is within the concentration
range of histamine levels detected in nasal secretions and
balf from allergic patients after allergen challenge
[18–20]. a significant decrease in subdiploid dna was
also observed in the histamine-treated monocytes (fig. 1b).
histamine inhibited both early and late apoptosis in
monocytes (fig. 1c). we also examined the anti-apoptotic
effect of histamine on monocytes from patients with ad.
monocytes from ad patients had a lower incidence of
spontaneous apoptosis by serum deprivation than monocytes from normal donors. in addition, pre-treatment of
monocytes from ad patients with histamine reduced
spontaneous apoptosis similar to that with monocytes
from normal donors (fig. 1c). monocytes were cultured
with histamine for different incubation time periods, and
the inhibitory effect was significant up to 48 h (fig. 1d).
in a second approach, we examined whether histamine
affected the anti- xxxg764xxx /fas-induced apoptosis.  xxxg764xxx /fas
expression was not significantly influenced by histamine
(fig. 2a). this ruled out the possibility that histamine
modulates the expression of  xxxg764xxx /fas and indirectly
affects the rate of fas/fasl-induced apoptosis in monocytes. monocytes were cultured with anti- xxxg764xxx /fas mab
ch11 in the absence or presence of histamine for 24 h, and
apoptosis was assessed by  xxxg166xxx  staining. as shown
in fig. 2b, histamine attenuated the apoptosis induced by
fas/fasl interaction. in a third approach, to examine the
effect of histamine on dexamethasone-induced apoptosis,
monocytes were cultured with 1 mm dexamethasone in the
absence or presence of histamine. the incidence of dexamethasone-induced monocytic apoptosis was significantly attenuated by histamine (fig. 2c). these results
demonstrated that histamine exhibited an anti-apoptotic
effect on monocytes.
histamine prevents monocytic apoptosis via the h2
receptor
to determine which receptor was responsible for the
histamine-induced inhibition of apoptosis, we pre-incubated monocytes with histamine receptor subtype-selective antagonists including  xxxd3050xxx  ( xxxg1078xxx  antagonist),
cimetidine ( xxxg1079xxx  antagonist) and thioperamide ( xxxg1080xxx  antagonist), before adding histamine in serum-free culture

monocytes was affected by histamine. monocytes were
cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of histamine
and intracellular expression of bcl-2 family proteins was
analysed by flow cytometry. as shown in fig. 4a, the
expression of bcl-2 and  xxxg1388xxx  in monocytes was enhanced by histamine, compared with controls, whereas
the expression of  xxxg251xxx  was not significantly influenced
by histamine. caspases play a role in many forms of
apoptosis [23]. among the caspases, a central role for
caspase-3 has been demonstrated in apoptosis. as shown
in fig. 4b, serum deprivation-induced apoptosis was
associated with significant up-regulation of expression
of activated caspase-3. however, treatment with histamine significantly reduced the percentage of monocytes
expressing activated caspase-3. histamine also significantly inhibited the activation of caspase-3 when apoptosis was induced by fas/fasl interaction.

the anti-apoptotic effect of histamine is partly mediated
by endogenously produced  xxxg1161xxx 

survival of monocytes (fig. 3). moreover, among the
selective histamine receptor agonists examined, dimaprit
dihydrochloride ( xxxg1079xxx  agonist) but not  xxxd321xxx  ( xxxg1078xxx 
agonist), or r-(-)-a-methylhistamine ( xxxg1080xxx  agonist) prevented the monocytic apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (fig. 3).

histamine has been shown to induce the production of
several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-1 and
il-6, by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes [24, 25]. recently, it has also been reported that
il-10, a prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine, is also
produced by monocytes and dcs after histamine treatment [13, 14]. to examine whether histamine-induced,
endogenously produced cytokines contribute to monocyte
survival, monocytes were cultured in conditioned medium
from monocytes that were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of histamine. as shown in fig. 5a, the
supernatants from monocytes treated with histamine
exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on monocytic
apoptosis. pre-treatment of the supernatants with an
anti-il-10 mab resulted in restoration of apoptosis to a

effect of histamine on the expression of bcl-2 family
proteins and activated caspase-3
the bcl-2 family of proteins is known to play a role in
regulating apoptosis [21]. in experiments using transgenic
mice overexpressing human bcl-2 in monocytes, these
cells do not undergo apoptosis in the absence of serum
and  xxxg524xxx  [22], which indicates that bcl-2 plays a role in
the survival of monocytes. therefore, we examined
whether the expression of the bcl-2 family proteins in

monocytes in the presence of histamine and anti-il-10

whereas, monocytes cultured with histamine in the presence or absence of anti- il-1b, il-6 or  xxxg524xxx  mabs
exhibited a similar degree of apoptosis (fig.5b). these
results indicated that the anti-apoptotic effect of histamine was mediated by il-10 in an autocrine and paracrine
fashion.

discussion
histamine is an important mediator involved in various
physiological and pathological conditions, including immediate hypersensitivity reactions and inflammation.
recently, immune regulation of allergic inflammation by
histamine has been demonstrated: (i) histamine activates
immature dcs, thus altering their t cell polarization
[14, 15], (ii) histamine enhances th1-type responses by
activation of the  xxxg1078xxx , whereas th1- and th2-type responses are negatively regulated via the  xxxg1079xxx  [16], (iii)
histamine regulates inflammatory cell adhesion and chemotaxis [12]. in this report, we provide additional evidence in support of the immunomodulatory effect of

328 f. soga et al
macrophages, whereas  xxxg2296xxx  treatment shifts their differentiation into dcs with potent antigen-presenting capacity [26, 27]. we recently demonstrated that histamine
induces differentiation of monocytes into  xxxg376xxx - xxxg2277xxx 
dcs in the presence of il-4 and granulocyte macrophagecolony stimulating factor, and that these dcs exhibit
enhanced phagocytic activity and cytokine-producing
capacity and reduced antigen-presenting capacity [28].
these cells exhibit different functions and therefore influence the outcome of the inflammatory response in tissues.
the effects of histamine are elicited through g-proteincoupled membrane receptors, which are subclassified as
h1, h2, h3 and h4 receptors [29, 30]. monocytes express
functional  xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx  and  xxxg1080xxx  [12]. it has been demonstrated that  xxxg1079xxx  mediates some of the pharmacological
effects of histamine in monocyte and macrophages; i.e.,
inhibition of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, superoxide anion
production, and cytokine production, such as  xxxg2296xxx  and
il-12 [13, 31–33]. in this study, the anti-apoptotic effect
of histamine in monocytes is mediated via the  xxxg1079xxx . in
monocytes,  xxxg1079xxx  stimulation leads to generation of camp
and the  xxxg1079xxx -mediated inhibitory effect on cytokine
production is camp dependent, raising the possibility that
the anti-apoptotic effect of histamine via the  xxxg1079xxx  is also
dependent on camp pathway [31–33]. indeed, our results
demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic effect of histamine
via the  xxxg1079xxx  was blocked by treatment with a camp
inhibitor, suggesting that histamine inhibits monocytic
apoptosis via a camp-dependent pathway.
another possible mechanism by which histamine can
inhibit monocytic apoptosis is through autocrine and
paracrine effects of endogenously produced cytokines. in
this study, the anti-apoptotic effect of histamine was
partly mediated by il-10 that was produced endogenously
by monocytes, whereas other monocyte-derived, histamine-induced cytokines, such as il-6 or il-1b did not
alter monocyte survival. this finding is consistent with a
recent report demonstrating that monocytes treated with
il-10 for 24 h inhibit spontaneous apoptosis associated
with up-regulation of  xxxg342xxx  inhibitory protein [34]. the
 xxxg1079xxx  stimulation was shown to increase il-10 production
and reduce il-12 secretion by monocytes and mature dcs
[13, 14]. histamine-treated dcs also polarize naı̈ve
cd41cells towards the th2 phenotype [14, 35]. thus,
histamine may favour a th2-based response, through
endogenously produced il-10, and contribute to the
initiation and maintenance of allergic disease.
furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effect of histamine was
mediated by up-regulation of bcl-2 and  xxxg1388xxx  and suppression of activated caspase-3. bcl-2 family proteins are
involved in determining the life and death fate of cells and
also modulate the activation of the caspase cascade in
response to various apoptotic stimuli [36]. for example,
specific depletion of  xxxg1388xxx  was shown to induce caspase3 activation and apoptosis of  xxxd2925xxx -treated u937

were cultured in supernatant from monocytes that were pre-treated with

histamine on monocytes, i.e. (1) histamine prevents
monocytic apoptosis in a dose- and time- dependent
manner; (2) this effect is mediated by the  xxxg1079xxx  and camp
pathway; (3) the anti-apoptotic effect of histamine is
mediated by up-regulation of bcl-2 and  xxxg1388xxx  expression
and suppression of activated caspase-3; and 4 this phenomenon results in part from the histamine-induced
endogenous production of il-10.
although the lack of appropriate exogenous stimuli can
cause monocytes to undergo apoptosis, monocytic apoptosis can be prevented by a variety of exogenous stimuli
that are related to allergic inflammation, such as lps,
 xxxg2296xxx , il-1b and fceri ligation [6–8]. in the present
study, we demonstrated that histamine prevents monocytic apoptosis, providing further evidence that mediators
stored in mast cells are involved in monocyte survival
during inflammatory processes in vivo. as monocytes are
the precursors of macrophages and dcs, stimuli that can
prolong their life span may also induce differentiation of
these cells into macrophages or dcs. for example, stimulation with fceri induces monocytes differentiation into

histamine prevents apoptosis

cells, which differentiate into macrophages, suggesting
that transient induction of  xxxg1388xxx  could prevent excessive
caspase activation in the differentiation process [37].  xxxg250xxx  overexpression has recently been shown to inhibit
caspase-3 activation and to delay the differentiation
process [38]. taken together, up-regulation of bcl-2 and
 xxxg1388xxx  by histamine may induce suppression of caspase-3,
thereby preventing monocytic apoptosis. caspases have
been shown to play an active role in the differentiation of
various cells [39, 40]. therefore, it would be interesting to
examine the involvement of caspases in monocytes undergoing differentiation in the presence of histamine.
in the present study, we suggest a new immunomodulatory function of histamine; i.e. histamine prevents
monocytic apoptosis via the  xxxg1079xxx . the release of histamine
by mast cells, at the site of inflammation and allergic
responses, may cause monocytes to prolong their life span
and differentiate into dcs, which may contribute to the
chronicity of inflammation in ad. therefore the use of
appropriate hr antagonists may lead to new treatments
against allergic diseases.
