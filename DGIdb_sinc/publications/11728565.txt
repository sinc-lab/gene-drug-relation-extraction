insulinotropic meglitinide analogues.  the loss of early-phase insulin secretion is an important and early event in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. because a normal pattern of insulin secretion is essential for the effective control of postprandial metabolism, a rational basis for the development of agents that target early-phase insulin release exists. conventional oral hypoglycaemic agents do not target, or adequately control, postprandial glycaemia. the emergence of new classes of oral agent with a more specific mode of action provides, for the first time, an opportunity to restore early-phase insulin release. one such drug class is the meglitinide analogues ( xxxd3098xxx ,  xxxd2702xxx , and  xxxd2654xxx ). these drugs are ideally suited for combination use with metformin. they could also prove effective in combination with a thiazolidinedione, a drug class that targets insulin resistance. exogenous insulin is frequently required in the late management of type 2 diabetes. however, one hope for newer combinations of diabetic drugs is that the functional life of the beta cell can be extended, thereby delaying the need for insulin injections.
