received may 19, 2005; accepted in revised form june 21, 2005

abstract
the expression of the p75  xxxg259xxx  receptor (p75ntr) is diminished in epithelial cells during
progression of prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro. previous studies have demonstrated a role for p75ntr as a
tumor suppressor in prostate growth. to better understand the molecular mechanism of p75ntr on tumor
suppression, we utilized a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray composed of  6,000 human
cancer-related genes to determine the gene expression

this paper utilized the cdna microarray technique in the
identiﬁcation of p75ntr-responsive genes in pc-3 prostate cancer cells. additionally, it provides a new role for the p75ntr
tumor suppressor molecule in the differentiation of pc-3 cells.

pattern altered by re-introduction of p75ntr into pc-3
prostate tumor cells. comparison of the transcripts in
the neo and p75ntr-transfected cells revealed 52 diﬀerentially expressed genes, of which 21 were up-regulated
and 31 were down-regulated in the presence of p75ntr.
based on the known biological functions of the p75ntrregulated genes, we observed that p75ntr modulated
the expression of genes that are critically involved in the
regulation of differentiation as well as cell adhesion,
signal transduction, apoptosis, tumor cell invasion, and
metastasis. several differentially expressed genes identiﬁed by microarray were selected for conﬁrmation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
immunoblot analysis further conﬁrmed increased cellular  xxxd3417xxx -binding  xxxg165xxx  (crabpi) and
 xxxg1150xxx  protein levels and decreased level of  xxxg1768xxx 
protein with increasing p75ntr protein expression. as
crabpi was elevated far more than any other genes,
we observed that the retinoids, all- xxxd3417xxx 
and 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  , that bind crabpi, promoted
nitroblue tetrazolium-associated functional cell diﬀerentiation in p75ntr pc-3 cells, but not in neo control
pc-3 cells. subsequent examination of the retinoic
acid receptors (rars) expression levels demonstrated
an absence of rar-b in the neo control cells and reexpression in the p75ntr expressing cells, consistent
with previous ﬁndings where rar-b is believed to
play a critical role as a tumor suppressor gene that
is lost during de-differentiation of prostate epithelial
cells. whereas the rar-a and -g protein levels remained unchanged, retinoid x receptor (rxr)-a
and -b also exhibited increasing protein levels with
re-expression of the p75ntr protein. moreover, the
ability of p75ntr sirna to knockdown levels of  xxxg1932xxx , rxr-a, and rxr-b supports the speciﬁcity of
the functional involvement of p75ntr in differentiation.
hence, re-expression of the p75ntr appears to

introduction
normal prostate development from the urogenital sinus
epithelium, as well as its growth, differentiation, and
maintenance of function in the adult, depends on androgen activity (cunha et al., 1992, 2003). members of
the steroid receptor superfamily, such as the androgen
receptor, have been shown to play a fundamental role in
the growth and differentiation of the prostate via mesenchymal–epithelial interactions (cunha et al., 1985,
1992, 2003), as well as its transformation to carcinoma
(montie and pienta, 1994). prostate cancer is the second
leading cause of all male cancer deaths next to lung
cancer (american cancer society, 2005). however, the
etiology of prostate cancer is still not yet completely
understood. some of the determinants of carcinoma
appear to be various growth stimulatory factors (androgens and polypeptide growth factors) and their receptors. indeed, the growth of prostate tumors is
accompanied by modiﬁcations in the expression of
growth factors and their receptors, many of which are
the products of proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor
genes (djakiew, 2000). normally, tumor suppressor
genes function to suppress cell growth or proliferation.
in this context, the p75  xxxg259xxx  receptor
(p75ntr), a 75 kda cell surface glycoprotein nerve
growth factor receptor, which binds with similar afﬁnity
to the  xxxg259xxx  family of growth factors (bothwell,
1995; friedman and greene, 1999; krygier and
djakiew, 2001), has been identiﬁed as a novel tumor
suppressor (krygier and djakiew, 2001) and metastasis
suppressor (krygier and djakiew, 2002) in human
prostate cancer. complete expression of the p75ntr in
the normal prostate, and partial loss of expression of
the p75ntr in organ-conﬁned adenocarcinoma tissue
(pﬂug et al., 1992, 1995; perez et al., 1997) indicate
an inverse association of p75ntr-expression with malignant progression of the human prostate. therefore,
p75ntr-associated differential gene expression patterns
could provide insights for a better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms involved in the development of
prostate cancer.
retinoids have been demonstrated to play an essential role in the growth, differentiation, and programed

cell death of many tissues and organs, including the
prostate (de luca, 1991; aboseif et al., 1997). retinoids
are capable of binding to the cellular retinoic acidbinding proteins i and ii (crabpi and ii) (nasonburchenal and dmitrovsky, 1999) and exert their cellular effects by binding to and activating the nuclear
 xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar-a, -b, -g) and retinoid
x receptors (rxr-a, -b, -g) (chambon, 1995). upon
ligand binding, these receptors regulate transcription
of target genes and result in biochemical cascades leading to alterations in cellular function (mangelsdorf
et al., 1995). diseases of the breast, cervix, and lung
have been linked to an aberrant expression of rars
and rxrs (roman et al., 1993; geisen et al., 1997). a
loss of rar-b expression has been demonstrated
in a variety of tumor samples, including the prostate
(lotan et al., 2000), breast (xu et al., 1997a), and lung
(xu et al., 1997b). retinoids, all- xxxd3417xxx 
(atra) and 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  ( xxxd114xxx ), have been
utilized as chemo-preventative agents in cancer therapy.
atra was reported to induce differentiation in an
aml (hl60) cell line (breitman et al., 1980) and was
administered to acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl)
patients resulting in a successful therapy with a diﬀerentiation agent (huang et al., 1987). more recently,
studies examining the effects of atra and  xxxd114xxx  on
the development of the prostate have suggested an inhibition of prostatic ductal growth and branching in
vitro possibly through the rar-b and -g (aboseif et al.,
1997). similarly, studies have shown the administration
of  xxxd2404xxx  and androgen ablation to have resulted in
a significant reduction in tumor size in athymic nude
mice in vivo (dahiya et al., 1995). thus, retinoids remain a focus as pharmacologic agents in cancer prevention and therapy through their ability to induce
differentiation.
although there have been studies examining the critical roles of p75ntr in prostate tumors, there have been
no investigations for p75ntr-regulated altered gene
expressions or p75ntr-induced differentiation by retinoids in pc-3 cells. in the present study, we examine
the differentially expressed gene proﬁles in response to
the tumor suppressor p75ntr in pc-3 prostate cancer
cells by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cdna)
microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (q-rt-pcr). a comparison of the neotransfected and p75ntr-transfected cells reveals distinctive patterns of gene expression, generating a list of
genes with significantly altered gene expression levels.
further analysis of these p75ntr-associated changes in
gene expression show for the ﬁrst time a novel function
for p75ntr in the partial re-differentiation of prostate
epithelial cells by inducing increased expression levels of
crabpi, rar-b, rxr-a, and -b. hence, the tumor
suppressor function of the p75ntr to inhibit growth
and proliferation now appears to also include a diﬀerentiation function.

materials and methods
cell culture
the pc-3 human prostate cancer cell line that exhibits suppressed
levels of the p75ntr protein (allen et al., 2005) and had previously
been transfected for re-expression of p75ntr protein or neo alone,
was ranked as neo control, and low, intermediate, and high expressors of the p75ntr protein (krygier and djakiew, 2001). ectopic clones were maintained in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s
medium (dmem; mediatech inc., herndon, va) containing
4.5 g/l glucose and l-glutamine supplemented with antibiotic/antimycotic (100 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx , 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and
0.25 mg/ml  xxxd164xxx ; mediatech inc.), 5% fetal bovine serum
(sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo), and 200 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx  (mediatech inc.). cell cultures were incubated in the presence of 10%
co2 at 371c.
rna extraction and puriﬁcation
total rna was extracted from pc-3 cells using trizol reagent
(invitrogen corporation, carlsbad, ca) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. the rna samples were subsequently
puriﬁed on rneasy mini-columns (qiagen, valencia, ca). total
rna with a spectrophotometric 260/280 nm ratio of 1.8 or higher
was used for microarray hybridization and q-rt-pcr. quality
and quantity of the rna were assessed by using the agilent technologies 2100 bioanalyzer (germantown, md).
microarray hybridization and data analysis
the cdna microarrays were each composed of  6,000 human
cancer-related genes (dr. yan a. su, loyola university medical
center, maywood, il). synthesis and ﬂuorescent labeling of cdna
targets from puriﬁed total rna was performed using micromax
direct labeling kit (perkin-elmer life sciences, boston, ma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, 50 mg of total
rna was transcribed into cdna targets in the presence of cy3dutp or cy5-dutp. the labeled cdna samples were puriﬁed by
the microcon ym-100 spin columns (millipore corp., bedford,
ma). cdna targets from control pc-3 cells were labeled with cy3dutp, while those from p75ntr-transfected pc-3 cells were labeled
with cy5-dutp. in each set of experiments, the respective cy3- and
cy5-labeled cdna samples were co-hybridized onto the microarray. all hybridizations were performed in duplicate. a further dyeswapping experiment was carried out in each set in which the use of
cy3- or cy5-dutp was switched in the cdna target labeling reaction. the non-transfected pc-3 cells rna was used as a common
reference in the microarray experiments. microarray hybridization
was performed at 651c for 14 hr and washed successively. the microarrays were spun at 1,000 r.p.m. for 4 min and scanned at 5 mm
resolution using the scanarray 5000xl microarray analysis system (packard biosciences, billerica, ma). signals generated from
cy3 and cy5 channels on each microarray were background subtracted and normalized by the lowess method and analyzed by
the scanarray express software (perkin-elmer life sciences). data
were reported as the normalized ratio of means of ﬂuorescence intensity between the two channels. genes that differentially expressed
at least a two-fold difference in ﬂuorescence intensity and the same
trend of change in expression in all three hybridizations were considered for further analysis. gene annotation and gene ontology
information were extracted from the human unigene cluster build
#161 (june 5, 2003) and locuslink from ncbi website.
q-rt-pcr
total rna (5 mg) from each cell type was treated with dnase i
(invitrogen, gaithersburg, md) to remove genomic dna and then

reverse-transcribed into ﬁrst-strand cdna in the presence of random hexamers and superscript ii (invitrogen corporation, carlsbad, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. genespecific primers (table 2) were designed using the primer express 2
software (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). q-rt-pcr was
performed in quadruplicate using sybr green i chemistry with
each specific gene primer pair on the abi prisms 7900 hts sequence detection system (applied biosystems) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. gene expression levels were determined by the relative standard curve method as described previously (pang et al., 2003) using three serial dilutions of the cdna
either from p75ntr-transfected cells or neo control cells. the ﬁnal
gene expression levels were reported after normalizing to the 18s
ribosomal rna contents of the cdna samples which were separately determined using taqman chemistry by q-rt-pcr.

immunoblot analysis
pc-3 cells expressing rank-order increased levels of p75ntr or neo
control were grown in 100-mm culture dishes (corning inc., corning, ny) until approximately 75% conﬂuent. cells were washed
with 1  phosphate-buﬀered saline (pbs) and lysed in 0.2 ml of
ripa buﬀer, on ice and centrifuged at 12,000  g for 10 min at 41c.
for immunoblots of p75ntr, the clones were lysed in np40 buﬀer
containing 2 mg/ml aprotinin. supernatants were retained for the
calculation of protein concentration according to the manufacturer’s protocol (biorad laboratories, hercules, ca).
immunoblot analyses of the cell lysates were performed as described previously (allen et al., 2005). briefly, 50 mg of protein was
loaded per lane onto 12% sds-page gels, electrophoresed for
1 hr, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (amersham
biosciences corp., piscataway, nj). the membrane was blocked in
5% non-fat milk in pbs for 1 hr, rinsed twice with pbs, and incubated overnight at 41c with primary antibodies in pbs. the primary antibodies used were a murine monoclonal anti-human
p75ntr antibody (diluted 1:1,000; upstate cell signaling solutions,
lake placid, ny), murine monoclonal crabpi (diluted 1:1,000;
abcam inc., cambridge, ma), murine polyclonal  xxxg1150xxx  antibody (diluted 1:500; abcam inc.), murine monoclonal anti-hupar
(diluted 1:500; santa cruz, biotechnology, santa cruz, ca),
murine monoclonal anti-human rar, specific to either a-, b-, gisotypes (diluted 1:1,000; chemicon, international, inc., temecula,
ca), and murine monoclonal anti-human rxr, specific to either
a-, b-, or g- isotypes (diluted 1:1,000; r&d systems, minneapolis,
mn). membranes were incubated in secondary antibody of horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse (diluted 1:2,000;
biorad laboratories) at room temperature for 1 hr. finally, membranes were rinsed three times with pbs and immunoreactivity was
visualized using the ecl western blotting detection reagents (amersham biosciences corp.).

nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt) reduction differentiation analysis
the ability of cells to reduce nbt has been documented as a functional marker of differentiation (collins et al., 1979; gueddari-pouzols et al., 2001). differentiation agents, atra or  xxxd114xxx  or
dmso (control), were added to the 60% conﬂuent p75ntrtransfected and neo control pc-3 cells and incubated for 24, 72, or
144 hr. cells of control and experimental groups were washed and
resuspended in 200 ml of dmem containing 2 mg/ml nbt and
1 mg/ml  xxxd2925xxx  (tpa). the cell suspension was incubated at 371c for 30 min in a shaking water bath.
cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 r.p.m for 5 min and
dissolved in 1 ml dmso. absorbance was determined at 570 nm.
the percentage of relative differentiation between the high expressors of p75ntr and the neo cell line was expressed as high-neo/
neo  100%. all agents, atra,  xxxd114xxx , nbt, and tpa, were
purchased from sigma chemical co (st. louis, mo).

388
p75ntr sirna transfection
the role of p75ntr in differentiation was examined by transfecting
the high expressors of p75ntr pc-3 cells with sirna directed
against p75ntr (dharmacon rna technologies, lafayette, co).
the high p75ntr clone pc-3 cells were grown to approximately
80% conﬂuency in six-well plates. in one tube, 10 ml of sirna was
mixed with 10 ml of serum-free dmem (mediatech inc.), while a
second tube contained 4 ml dharmafect transfection reagent
(dharmacon rna technologies) mixed with 196 ml serum-free
dmem and each was incubated at room temperature for 5 min
before the two solutions were combined and allowed to incubate for
an additional 20 min at room temperature for complex formation.
after addition of sirna to each well, complete medium was added
for a desired volume of 2 ml. mock transfects were treated identically with the absence of sirna against p75ntr. the plates were
incubated for 96 hr, after which they were harvested for immunoblot analysis as described previously.

statistical analysis
the statistical differences between data were analyzed by the
spearman rank correlation using the prizm program (graph pad
software). data were considered significant when po0.05.

results
change in gene expression pattern in p75ntrexpressing pc-3 cells
in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the
tumor suppressor function (krygier and djakiew, 2001,
2002) of p75ntr in pc-3 cells, we examined the change
in gene expression pattern in the p75ntr-expressing  xxxg1682xxx  cells with respect to the vector-transfected cells (neo).
among the  6,000 human genes examined in the
cdna microarray experiments, the expressions of 52
genes were found to be altered by the re-introduction of
p75ntr. among these 52 genes, 21 appeared to be upregulated and 31 appeared to be down-regulated (figs.
1a,1b). fifteen of these genes did not have characterized biological functions. the complete list of the 52
differentially expressed genes, their genbank and unigene id numbers, biological functions, and fold change
in ﬂuorescent signal intensity is shown in table 1.
the up-regulated genes relative to neo-transfected
pc-3 cells (table 1) included rgs5 ( four-fold), a
regulator of gtpase enzyme, and  xxxg1150xxx  ( ﬁvefold), a regulator of cell growth. while  xxxg1857xxx , a proteolytic enzyme, exhibited a six-fold increase,  xxxg322xxx ,
involved in cell growth and regulation, showed an
eight-fold increase in expression. wsb1, a socs
box containing wd protein gene (  10-fold), and
crabpi, involved in  xxxd3417xxx -mediated diﬀerentiation and proliferation, showed the highest levels of
expression (  33-fold).
thirty-one genes showed at least a two-fold decrease
in p75ntr-expressing cells relative to neo control (table
1). transcriptional regulators such as tbx3 (rna po-

lymerase ii transcription factor), nsep1 (nuclease sensitive element binding protein 1), and elf3 (e74-like
factor 3) were down-regulated two- to four-fold. cytoskeletal biogenesis proteins showed a general decrease
in expression in the presence of p75ntr,  xxxg1290xxx  (fourfold) and flnb (three-fold), similar to transcription
regulators; however,  xxxg661xxx  (dsp), a desmosomal
protein and structural constituent of the cytoskeleton,
was reduced dramatically by nine-fold.  xxxg1768xxx , the
plasminogen activator urokinase receptor, was downregulated by six- to seven-fold. a three to ﬁve-fold decrease in ﬂuorescent intensity was observed for stk-6,
a serine threonine kinase involved in mitosis,  xxxg467xxx ,
shown to have creatine kinase activity, and  xxxg1853xxx ,
shown to have trypsin activity.

pcr analysis are shown in table 2. each gene in neo
control pc-3 cells was assigned an expression level of
one for comparison with p75ntr-expressing cells. the
fold changes in gene expression levels determined by
microarray analysis and q-rt-pcr are shown for
comparison in table 3. q-rt-pcr analysis conﬁrmed
the up-regulation of crabpi,  xxxg1150xxx , and rgs5
(fig. 2a). although  xxxg322xxx ,  xxxg1857xxx , and wsb1 had
shown an increase in ﬂuorescent signal intensity by microarray analysis, further analysis by q-rt-pcr indicated the change in their expression levels was less than
2. q-rt-pcr analysis of the genes that appeared to be
down-regulated based on microarray analysis conﬁrmed a reduction of mrna levels in p75ntr-expressing pc-3 cells for nine genes (fig. 2b).

changes in levels of protein expression
by p75ntr
in order to conﬁrm whether the alterations of gene expression at the level of transcription subsequently
resulted in changes at the translational level, we
performed western blot analysis for a select group of

genes with varying expression levels. immunoblot analysis of two up-regulated genes,  xxxg1150xxx  and crabpi,
demonstrated a rank-order increase in protein levels
commensurate with increased levels of p75ntr protein
(fig. 3). conversely, levels of the  xxxg1768xxx  protein, a
down-regulated gene, demonstrated a progressive decrease with a rank-order increase of p75ntr protein expression (fig. 3). levels of the b-actin loading control
were relatively similar between p75ntr-expression
levels.
differentiation effect induced by retinoids in p75ntr
pc-3 cells
as the microarray analysis, q-rt-pcr, and immunoblot analysis all consistently showed a large up-regulation of crabpi in the p75ntr-transfected cells, we
investigated the effects of retinoids in these cells with a
differentiation assay that determines the burst oxidative
capacity by nbt reduction (collins et al., 1979; gueddari-pouzols et al., 2001). there was a significant
(po0.01) temporal and dose-dependent increase in the
rate of nbt reduction by p75ntr-expressing pc-3 cells

formation was associated with (a) atra or (b)  xxxd114xxx  treatment (po0.01) after 6 days.

p75ntr clones revealed increasing levels of protein expression (fig. 5). however, there was only minimal expression of rxr-a and -b protein in the neo (vectortransfected alone) (fig. 5). levels of rxr-g protein
expression were undetected in both the control and
p75ntr clones (fig. 5). b-actin loading control levels
remained unchanged between p75ntr and neo samples
(fig. 5). treatment of the pc-3 clone that expresses
high levels of p75ntr protein with sirna to p75ntr
resulted in a knockdown of the levels of rar-b,  xxxg1998xxx , and rxr-b, whereas levels of the b-actin loading
control were similar between treatments (fig. 6).

suppressor in human urogenital cancers (krygier and
djakiew, 2001, 2002), we utilized a cdna microarray
comprised of more than 6,000 human cancer-related
genes to determine the alteration of gene expression
proﬁles of p75ntr-transfected prostate cancer cells.
subsequently, a select group of genes identiﬁed by microarray analysis that exhibited qualitative changes in
gene expression in response to p75ntr-expression were
examined by q-rt-pcr and immunoblot analyses for
veriﬁcation of p75ntr-dependent changes in gene ex-

pression and levels of gene product, respectively. the
observation that not all qualitative changes in gene expression observed by the cdna microarray could be
conﬁrmed by q-rt-pcr or immunoblot analyses indicates that some caution should be employed in the
potential over-interpretation of stand alone microarray
analyses. significantly, three of the gene products
( xxxg1768xxx ,  xxxg1150xxx , and crabpi) that exhibited
changes in expression levels with p75ntr-expression
on the cdna microarray, and conﬁrmed by q-rtpcr and immunoblot have been linked to the progression of prostate cancer.
a preponderance of literature has documented a role
of the  xxxg1767xxx  (upa)
complexed with the upa receptor ( xxxg1768xxx ) causatively involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis of
prostate cancer (sheng, 2001). upa catalyzes the extracellular proteolytic conversion of the zymogen plasminogen to plasmin that is then able to degrade
extracellular matrix components (rabbani and mazar,
2001) and regulate integrin-mediated signal transduction pathways in tumor cells (yebra et al., 1999; rabbani and mazar, 2001). localized pericellular upa
activity is facilitated by the cell surface anchored
 xxxg1768xxx  (ploug et al., 1993) that allows for the spatial
regulation of upa activity. significantly, the density of
both upa and  xxxg1768xxx  are higher in tumor tissues than
from non-cancerous prostate tissues (miyake et al.,
1999). comparable expression patterns of upa and
 xxxg1768xxx  have been observed in human prostate cancer
cell lines of different invasive and metastatic potential
(hollas et al., 1992). this up-regulation of upa and
 xxxg1768xxx  correlates with an aggressive phenotype and
poor prognosis of human prostate cancer (sheng, 2001).
hence, upa and its receptor  xxxg1768xxx  have been suggested as attractive targets for anti-metastatic therapy
because of their role in invasion and metastasis of
tumor cells (liu and rabbani, 1995; miyake et al.,
1999; rabbani and gladu, 2002). significantly, the
p75ntr has been characterized as a metastasis suppressor of human prostate cancer cells (krygier and
djakiew, 2002). hence down-regulation of p75ntr-dependent  xxxg1768xxx  levels in prostate tumor cells is consistent with a metastasis suppressor function of the
p75ntr, particularly in the context of suppressed pericellular proteolysis that is dependent on a cell surface
anchored  xxxg1768xxx .
the insulin-like growth factor (igf) system is characterized by complex interactions between the igfs,
their receptors, high afﬁnity binding proteins, receptors
for these binding proteins, and proteases. the ability of
the igfs to mediate growth through their receptors can
be altered by interaction with a variety of igf binding
proteins (igfbps). specifically, sequestration of igfs
by  xxxg1150xxx  has been suggested to attenuate igf receptor signal transduction (guenette and tenniswood,
1994) during inhibition of growth and induction of

394

apoptosis.  xxxg1150xxx  also binds to the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (tonner et al., 2000). as the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is the main inhibitor of
upa (gils and declerck, 2004) a complex of  xxxg1150xxx 
with pai-1 potentially binding upa would be consistent
with suppression of tumor cell invasion and metastasis
of prostate cancer cells (sheng, 2001). conversely, in the
relative absence of pai-1, the proteolytic cleavage of
 xxxg1150xxx  by proteases has been shown to decrease
 xxxg1150xxx  afﬁnity for ligands and therefore enhance the
bioavailability of igfs. in this context, the  xxxg745xxx , psa, is known to preferentially cleave  xxxg1150xxx 
(rajah et al., 1996) thereby releasing igfs to stimulate
growth of prostatic epithelial cells (cohen et al, 1994).
hence, considering the ability of  xxxg1150xxx  to sequester
igfs and bind pai-1, the up-regulation of  xxxg1150xxx 
following ectopic re-expression of the p75ntr identiﬁes
a novel  xxxg1150xxx  associated mechanism for the tumor
and metastasis suppressor role of p75ntr in prostate
epithelial cells.
 xxxd3417xxx  regulation of prostate cell growth and
differentiation is characterized by interactions between
the  xxxd2071xxx , their binding proteins, and retinoid
receptors (peehl et al., 1993).  xxxd2071xxx  in the form
of atra or  xxxd114xxx  lack appreciable aqueous solubility and thus must be bound to crabpi or crabpii
to be present within the cell (nason-burchenal and
dmitrovsky, 1999). hence, it has been suggested that
the crabps act to sequester  xxxd2071xxx  in the cytoplasm (ong et al., 1994). crabpi has been documented to play a critical role in  xxxd3417xxx -mediated
differentiation (leid et al., 1992) in numerous cell culture and animal models (lotan, 1995; nagy et al., 1998;
hansen et al., 2000). conversely, crabpi levels have
been shown to be lower in carcinoma tissue than in
adjacent areas of normal tissue (gates and rees, 1985).
hence, the high degree of crabpi up-regulation at
both the transcriptional and translational levels of expression in response to ectopic expression of p75ntr in
pc-3 cancer cells is consistent with the potentiation of
 xxxd3417xxx  availability in these cells for diﬀerentiation. clinically, retinoids have been able to reverse premalignant lesions as well as inhibit the development of
second primary tumors in patients (lotan, 1996), thereby demonstrating the usefulness of retinoids in both the
chemotherapy as well as chemoprevention of some human cancers. in prostate cancer the  xxxd2071xxx  have
pleiotropic effects decreasing 5a-reductase activity, inducing rb activation, and decreasing  xxxg183xxx 
expression in prostate cell lines (halgunset et al., 1987;
jutley et al., 1990; gao et al., 1999). significantly, in our
analysis, treatment of pc-3 cells that ectopically express
the p75ntr with atra or  xxxd114xxx  in the nbt differentiation assay exhibited a biochemical diﬀerentiation response, whereas the control neo-transfected pc-3
cells did not exhibit a differentiation response. considering the documented role of crabpi in  xxxd3417xxx -

mediated differentiation (leid et al., 1992) these results
are consistent with p75ntr up-regulation of crabpi,
which could facilitate  xxxd3417xxx  induction of biochemical differentiation in the pc-3 tumor cells.
as ectopic p75ntr-expression substantially elevated
levels of crabpi, we investigated additional components of the retinoid signaling axis. retinoids exert their
pleiotropic effects through their rars and/or rxrs,
which are members of the steroid  xxxg1603xxx 
superfamily (chambon, 1996). within the cytoplasm
the rars and rxrs serve as intracellular storage sites
of retinoids with speciﬁcity of atra binding only to
rars (-a, -b, and -g), while  xxxd114xxx  can bind both the
rars and rxrs (-a, -b, and -g) (piedraﬁta and pfahl,
1999). however, under physiological conditions and in
the presence of  xxxd3417xxx , only an rxr:rar heterodimer can lead to productive dna binding (zhang
et al., 1992). expression of rxr-a appears diminished
in some prostate cancer specimens and cell lines, including pc-3 cells (zhong et al., 2003). in addition,
conditional disruption of rxr-a leads to the development of pre-neoplastic lesions of the prostate (huang
et al., 2002). similarly, expression of rxr-b is diminished (lotan et al., 2000) with progression of prostate
cancer (alfaro et al., 2003). significantly, expression of
rar-b is lost in prostate cancers, while levels of rara and -g remain unaffected (piedraﬁta and pfahl, 1999).
more recently, rar-b has been identiﬁed as a retinoid
target gene, believed to play an important role as a
tumor suppressor gene (chen et al., 2002). in this context, the targeted disruption of rar-b has been shown
to result in the loss of  xxxd3417xxx -associated growth
arrest (faria et al., 1999), consistent with a tumor suppressor function of the p75ntr in part via restoration of
the rar-b tumor suppressor. clearly, the ability of
p75ntr to restore expression of rar-b, rxr-a, and -b
that are typically diminished in prostate cancer, and the
ability of p75ntr sirna to knockdown their expression levels supports the speciﬁcity of the functional involvement of p75ntr in differentiation. taken together,
p75ntr-dependent elevation of levels of crabpi,
rar-b, rxr-a, and rxr-b, in conjunction with retinoid induction of biochemical differentiation, is consistent with a novel role of the p75ntr in the induction
of differentiation in the prostate. this is consistent with
the role of p75ntr in neuronal (andrieu et al., 2003)
and myogenic (erck et al., 1998) differentiation. these
results further suggest that the p75ntr and retinoid
signaling pathways participate in cross-talk during the
process of prostatic cellular differentiation.
