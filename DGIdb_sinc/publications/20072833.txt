abstract  xxxd1815xxx , (former  xxxd1815xxx ),
is an orally available small-molecule multikinase inhibitor. it potently inhibits bcr-abl
and src-family kinases (src,  xxxg1306xxx ,  xxxg2437xxx ,
 xxxg824xxx ), but also c-kit,  xxxg1710xxx -a and b, and
ephrin receptor kinase.
 xxxd1815xxx  is about 300 times more potent
than imatinib in cells expressing unmutated
bcr-abl in vitro. the drug has demonstrated
activity against clinically relevant mutations,
including those associated with poor prognosis
during ongoing imatinib therapy.
 xxxd1815xxx  is approved for the treatment of
patients with bcr-abl-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (cml), resistant or intolerant to
imatinib in chronic, accelerated, and blast phase.
it also is approved for the treatment of philadelphia
chromosome positive (ph+) acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (all) resistant or intolerant to
imatinib.
a single daily dose of 100 mg in chronic
phase cml results in high hematologic and
molecular remission rates and prolongation of
survival. in accelerated and blastic phase as well

as in all, 70 mg twice daily is recommended.
complete hematologic and cytogenetic remissions (cr) frequently occur even in this patient
group with poor prognosis. remissions however
are very short.
side effects of  xxxd1815xxx  are frequent but
mostly moderate and manageable and include
cytopenias and pleural effusions. the role of  xxxd1815xxx  in other diseases, including solid tumors, has
to be identified.

7.1
introduction
cml is a clonal disease of the hematopoietic
stem cell. it has been considered as a model for
other cancers based on its multistep evolution
with three stages, its association with a defined
cytogenetic translocation t(9;22)(q34; q11), the
elucidation of molecular pathogenesis, and the
successful development of a molecular therapy.
the philadelphia chromosome (ph) was recognized as the first constitutive chromosomal abnormality in cancer in cml in 1960 (nowell and
hungerford 1960). subsequent studies revealed
that ph originates from a t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. the translocation involves the abltyrosine kinase on chromosome 9 and a gene on
chromosome 22 named  xxxg256xxx 
(bcr). transcription of the fusion gene results in

the chimeric protein bcr-abl, which is a constitutively active form of the  xxxg24xxx   xxxg2198xxx .
bcr-abl plays a key role in the pathogenesis of cml and in the 15–30% of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (all), which are ph+
(faderl et al. 2000). the pathogenetic relevance
of bcr-abl has been proven by its capacity to
transform hematologic cells in vitro and in vivo
(daley and van etten 1990; druker et al. 1996).
however, expression of bcr-abl is not sufficient to produce cml in humans, and additional
changes are necessary. this is supported by the
observations of clonal ph-negative precursors
of cml (copland et al. 2006); moreover, with
very sensitive pcr-methods, bcr-abl can be
found in about 30% of healthy adults (bose
et al. 1998).
the estimated incidence of cml is approximately one case per year in 100,000 people. the
clinical course of the disease is characterized by
a chronic phase, which eventually develops into
an accelerated phase and subsequently into fatal
blast crisis. median survival of untreated patients
is approximately 3–5 years (hochhaus 2007).
treatment was palliative during the first century of cml, and included splenic irradiation,
oral cytotoxic drugs  xxxd390xxx  and hydroxyurea,
and  xxxg1137xxx  (ifna). allografting, introduced in the 1970s, despite its risks for mortality
and morbidity has been the initial treatment of
choice for younger patients, as it is the only
proven, potentially curative treatment. however,
because of donor and demographic characteristics, it is an option only for about 40% of the
patients (gratwohl et al. 1998). ifn induces
major cytogenetic responses (mcyr) in 6–19%
of patients with chronic phase cml (hehlmann
et al. 1994). this rate increases with the addition
of  xxxd1790xxx  (guilhot et al. 1997), and complete
cytogenetic responders have longer remission
duration and survival compared with nonresponders (the italian cooperative study group
on chronicmyeloid leukemia 1998).
with the introduction of the first abl tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, imatinib (formerly sti571), in

m. lindauer and a. hochhaus

2001, the therapy of cml has changed dramatically. response rates in imatinib treated patients
are high in chronic phase disease with complete
cytogenetic response rates (ccyr) of up to 87%
as reported by the international randomized
study of interferon and sti571 (iris) (druker
et al. 2006). in accelerated or blast phase,
however, only 21 and 7% achieved mcyr,
respectively, and the responses were only
transient (giles et al. 2008).
relapse occurs annually in about 4% of the
patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib
and is more frequent in advanced phases of the
disease. criteria for suboptimal response and
failure to imatinib have been defined, depending
on treatment duration (baccarani et al. 2006).
in the pivotal iris reporting imatinib treatment of cml with a follow-up of 5 years, failure
to achieve a ccyr at 12 months was 31%, and at
5 years was 13% (druker et al. 2006). unsatis­
factory therapeutic effect was the most common reason to discontinue treatment in this
study. in accelerated phase and blast crisis,
rates of resistance to imatinib and disease relapse
were even higher (giles et al. 2008).
mechanisms of resistance to imatinib can be
divided into bcr-abl-dependent and bcr-ablindependent mechanisms (ritchie and nichols
2006). most common are kinase domain mutations
in the bcr-abl gene that either impair the ability
of the kinase to adopt the inactive conformation to
which imatinib binds, or directly interfere with imatinib-binding to the bcr-abl protein, which
account for 50–90% of all cases.
more than 60 different bcr-abl mutations
have been identified, conferring clinical resistance to imatinib. occasionally, resistance is
caused by overexpression of bcr-abl due to
bcr-abl-gene amplification (shah 2005;
apperley 2007).
bcr-abl-independent mechanisms include
clonal evolution and activation of alternative
signaling pathways, like the src-pathway.
rarely, resistance to imatinib may occur if the
intracellular concentration of the drug is too

low. reasons could be an increased efflux of the
drug, mediated by multi drug resistance gene 1
( xxxg10xxx ), but also diminished influx caused by
interactions with the organic cation transporter
1 (hoct1) (hochhaus et al. 2007a).
strategies to overcome imatinib failure include
application of higher doses of the drug, but also
the administration of structurally different bcrabl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors such as  xxxd1815xxx 
( xxxd1815xxx ™) or  xxxd2724xxx  ( xxxd2724xxx ™). other tyrosine
kinase inhibitors in earlier stages of clinical
development include  xxxd359xxx  ( xxxd359xxx ), a
src-abl, but not  xxxg1710xxx  or c-kit inhibitor
and inno-406, a lyn-abl inhibitor (jabbour
et al. 2007).
 xxxd1815xxx  is approved for patients with all
phases of cml and also patients with ph+ all,
who are intolerant or resistant to imatinib. it
induces marked remissions even in pretreated
patients.
 xxxd1815xxx  is a thiazole-carboxamide compound that is structurally unrelated to imatinib.
as an atp-competitive small-molecule multikinase inhibitor, it inhibits bcr-abl, but also
other kinases including the src family of kinases
(sfk). when compared with imatinib,  xxxd1815xxx 
exhibits increased potency to inhibit bcr-abl,
but with reduced selectivity.  xxxd1815xxx  binds to
both active and inactive conformations of bcrabl with less stringent conformational requirements than imatinib.
the drug has demonstrated activity against
clinically relevant mutations, including those
associated with poor prognosis during ongoing
imatinib therapy. however, it is not active

ho

against the t315i bcr-abl mutation. inhibition
of the sfk allows  xxxd1815xxx  to overcome resistance conferred by sfk activation.
inhibition of src is an attractive target in
oncology, as elevated levels and activities of src
and sfk have been shown in numerous human
cancer cell lines and tumor tissues.  xxxd1815xxx  as
an inhibitor of src has been shown to inhibit
growth, migration, cell adhesion, and induces
cell cycle arrest in many different cell lines.
there are clinical studies ongoing on the effect
of  xxxd1815xxx  in solid tumors and ph-negative
myeloproliferative disorders.

structure and mechanism of action

monohydrate ( xxxd1815xxx ) is an orally
available small-molecule multitargeted kinase
inhibitor (fig. 7.1). it potently inhibits bcrabl and src-family kinases (src,  xxxg1306xxx ,
 xxxg2437xxx ,  xxxg824xxx ), as well as c-kit,  xxxg1710xxx -a and b,
and ephrin receptor kinase at nanomolar concentrations (lombardo et al. 2004; huang et al.
2007). in addition, it has activity against most
imatinib resistant isoforms of bcr-abl.
 xxxd1815xxx  has been shown to block g1/s transition and inhibit cell growth in normal and neoplastic cells (fabarius et al. 2008).

 xxxd1815xxx  was designed as an atp-competitive
inhibitor of src and abl. abelson kinase
(abl) is the constitutively active tyrosine-kinase
of the bcr-abl fusion protein. it is a cytoplasmic nonreceptor  xxxg2198xxx . human  xxxg24xxx 
has a number of structural domains critical for its
activity. the major isoform of  xxxg24xxx  has three
src-homology (sh) domains. sh1 domain
contains the  xxxg2198xxx  activity, while sh2
and sh3 domains allow interaction with other
proteins. under normal conditions, the activity of
the abl  xxxg2198xxx  is tightly regulated.
like many tyrosine kinases, abl regulates
its catalytic activity via conformational changes,
switching between active and inactive forms by
opening and closing an activation loop. the
sequence available for binding in the inactive
conformation varies dramatically between different kinases and provides a potential for bin­
ding specificity.

as demonstrated by x-ray crystallography,
 xxxd1815xxx  binds the active conformation of the
kinase. the compound has been shown to bind
the atp-binding site of the sh domain 1 of
abl (lombardo et al. 2004; tokarski et al.
2006). in addition, molecular docking studies
(gambacorti-passerini et al. 2005) showed that
 xxxd1815xxx  is likely to bind to the inactive form of
abl as well, requiring a lower conformational
stringency than imatinib, which selectively targets only an inactive conformation of the ablkinase domain (fig. 7.2).
 xxxd1815xxx  has been shown to be 325-fold
more potent than imatinib for inhibiting unmutated bcr-abl. the concentration required
for 50% inhibition [ic50] is 0.6 nmol/l for  xxxd1815xxx  and 280 nmol/l for imatinib (o’hare et al.
2005). it is suggested that the stronger binding
activity of  xxxd1815xxx  over imatinib is at least partially due to its ability to bind to active and inactive conformations of the abl protein.
owing to the different structural requirements for binding of  xxxd1815xxx  when compared

inhibition of abl

 xxxd1815xxx 

with imatinib, the drug inhibits various imatinib-resistant bcr-abl mutations, except the
t315i type (o’hare et al. 2005; shah et al.
2004). this is the basis for the activity of the
drug in imatinib resistant disease, caused by
mutated bcr-abl.

7.2.2
inhibition of src
src is a member of a nine-gene family that
includes  xxxg2437xxx ,  xxxg824xxx , lyn,  xxxg1306xxx ,  xxxg1028xxx , fgr,
blk, and yrk. src family kinases (sfk)
consist of a unique nh2-terminal region, two
src homology domains (sh2 and sh3), a
highly conserved kinase domain, and a coohterminal tail containing a negative regulatory
tyrosine residue. src and sfk cooperate in
several cellular processes including migration,
adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis, proliferation,
differentiation, and immune function. they play
a major role in the development, growth, progression, and metastasis of a wide variety of
human cancers (kopetz et al. 2007).
elevated levels of src kinase activity and/
or protein expression levels have been found in
a variety of human epithelial cancers, including
colon, breast, pancreatic and lung carcinomas,
brain tumors, as well as in osteosarcomas and
ewing sarcomas. the levels of expression or acti­
vation generally correlate with disease pro­
gression.
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits src with an ic50 of
0.5 nmol/l (lombardo et al. 2004). inhibition of
src activation by  xxxd1815xxx  can suppress tumor
growth in human breast cancer cell lines, human
prostate cancer cells, head and neck, lung cancer, and osteosarcoma cell lines (johnson et al.
2005; finn et al. 2007; shor et al. 2007).
however, preclinical studies suggest that  xxxd1815xxx  induces apoptosis in only a small subset of
cell lines. inhibition of migration, invasion, and
cell adhesion by  xxxd1815xxx  is reported more frequently (johnson et al. 2005; nam et al. 2005;

serrels et al. 2006). in a nude mouse model of
prostate cancer, tumor growth and the development of lymph node metastasis were inhibited
by  xxxd1815xxx  (park et al. 2008).
therefore, from in vitro and animal data, as
single agent,  xxxd1815xxx  can be predicted to have
only modest effect in most tumors. recent phase
i and phase ii trials on  xxxd1815xxx  in several solid
tumors confirm this prediction (johnson et al.
2007; evans et al. 2005; yu et al. 2008).

7.2.3
inhibition of c-kit
kit ( xxxg1279xxx ) is a receptor  xxxg2198xxx .
normally, kit is activated when bound to its
ligand, the stem cell factor (scf). gain of function mutations of c-kit plays a crucial role in
several malignancies, including gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (gist) (hirota et al. 1998), systemic mastocytosis (sm), acute myeloid leukemia (aml), lymphomas, and germ cell tumors
(schittenhelm et al. 2006). imatinib, which is a
potent inhibitor of c-kit has become the treatment of choice for advanced gist. comparable
with its binding properties to abl, imatinib only
binds to the inactive conformation of c-kit.
imatinib-resistant c-kit mutants are frequent
and often occur in the activation loop of c-kit,
resulting in a constitutive active conformation of
c-kit, to which imatinib cannot bind.
these mutations have relevance in mast cell
disorders, seminoma, and aml, and are always
resistant to imatinib.  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits c-kit
10–20-fold stronger than imatinib with an ic50 for
inhibition of autophosphorylation and cellular proliferation of 5–10 nmol/l (schittenhelm et al.
2006). in addition,  xxxd1815xxx  is a potent inhibitor of
many clinically relevant mutated forms of c-kit,
including imatinib-resistant kit activation loop
mutations in vitro (shah et al. 2006). despite these
promising in vitro data,  xxxd1815xxx  failed to induce
significant remission rates in a phase ii study in
patients with sm (verstovsek et al. 2008).

7.2.4
inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor
receptor ( xxxg1710xxx )-a and b tyrosine kinases
 xxxg1710xxx -a and b are receptor tyrosine kinases.
they are activated by binding of plateletderived growth factor (pdgf). pdgf-signaling
has a significant role in the formation of connective tissue and is also important during
wound healing in the adults.  xxxg1710xxx -a and b
are expressed mainly on fibroblasts and smooth
muscle cells (heldin and westermark 1999).
 xxxg1710xxx -a  xxxg2198xxx  activating mutations have been described in the pathogenesis of
some gist tumors (heinrich et al. 2003). fusion
proteins consisting of the  xxxg791xxx  ( xxxg791xxx ) and  xxxg1710xxx -a and b
receptor tyrosine kinases have constitutive transforming activity. they are found in a subgroup
of myeloproliferative disorders associated with
eosinophilia (cross and reiter 2008).
in addition,  xxxg1710xxx -b is involved in the formation of restenosis following coronar angioplastie, and, in combination with abl, in the
pathogenesis of dermal fibrosis.  xxxd1815xxx , which
inhibits  xxxg1710xxx -b with an ic50 of 28 nmol/l, is
active in in vitro models for these diseases (chen
et al. 2006; akhmetshina et al. 2008).

genesis, they have been implicated in cellular
transformation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.
 xxxg709xxx  is frequently overexpressed and functionally altered in many invasive cancers including
metastatic melanoma, as well as cancers of the
mammary gland, cervix, ovary, prostate, colon,
lung, kidney, esophagus, and pancreas.
 xxxd1815xxx  was shown to be a potent inhibitor
of ephrin a2 receptor kinase with an ic50 of
17 nmol/l in various cell lines (huang et al.
2007; chang et al. 2008).

7.2.6
additional effects
it has been demonstrated that  xxxd1815xxx  induces
defects in spindle generation, cell cycle arrest,
and centrosome alterations in leukemic cells,
tumor cell lines, as well as normal cells. these
effects are not attributable to the inhibition of a
single kinase; rather it is the expression of non
specific effects on multiple kinases (fabarius
et al. 2008).

7.3
clinical data

7.2.5
inhibition of ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases

7.3.1
pharmacokinetic profile

the ephrin family of receptor tyrosine kinases
constitutes the largest subfamily of receptor
tyrosine kinases. they are divided into two subclasses (ephrin a and ephrin b) based on
sequence similarity and their preferential binding
to ligands, which are tethered to the cell surface
either by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor
(ephrin a) or by a single transmembrane domain
(ephrin b) (kullander and klein 2002). eph
receptor tyrosine kinases have important functions in development and diseases. in tumori­

 xxxd1815xxx  is administered orally. the drug is
rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations occur 0.5–3 h after administration. the
intake of food is not relevant for pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1815xxx . in a dose range of 25–120 mg
twice daily, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) increased proportionally.
the drug is extensively metabolized in the liver,
predominantly by cytochrome p 450 (cyp)
3a4, only 30% remain unchanged. the metabolites of the compound are unlikely to play a

7

89

 xxxd1815xxx 

pharmacologic role. there are linear elimination
characteristics over the abovementioned dose
range with a terminal elimination half life of
5–6 h.
elimination occurs mostly in the feces (85%)
and only little in urine (4%).  xxxd1815xxx  is excreted
as metabolites, only 19% of a dose was recovered as unchanged drug in the feces (bristolmyers squibb 2007).
 xxxd1815xxx  is a substrate and an inhibitor of
cyp3a4. therefore, there is a potential for
interaction with other concomitantly administered drugs that are metabolized primarily by or
modulate the activity of cyp3a4.
systemic exposure to  xxxd1815xxx  is increased
if it is co-administered with drugs that are inhibitors of cyp3a4 (e.g., clarythromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole).
if co-administered with drugs that induce
cyp3a4 (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin,
carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or
hypericum perforatum, also known as st. john’s
wort),  xxxd1815xxx  auc is reduced. it was reduced
by 82% when co-administered with rifampicin.
 xxxd1815xxx  auc was reduced when co-administered with h2-blockers/proton-pump inhibitors or
antacids. concomitant administration of famotidin
reduced  xxxd1815xxx  auc by 61%, while co-administration of  xxxd131xxx  reduced dasa­
tinib auc by 55% (bristol-myers squibb 2007).

7.3.2
clinical studies with  xxxd1815xxx 
in cml and other diseases
most clinical data have been reported on the
treatment of patients with all phases of cml
and ph + all. there are few reports on the
properties of the drug outside cml, in
ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders, in
gist-tumors, in hormone refractory prostate
cancer, and in various other solid tumors.

7.3.3
cml and ph+ all – overview
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd1815xxx  in cml
patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib was
assessed in a phase i trial (talpaz et al. 2006).
five phase ii trials, termed start (src-abl
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibition activity research
trials), were consecutively performed in all
phases of cml in patients resistant or intolerant
to imatinib (kantarjian et al. 2007; hochhaus
et al. 2007 b; ottmann et al. 2007; guilhot et al.
2007a; guilhot et al. 2007b; cortes et al. 2007).
dose optimization phase iii trails have been performed in chronic phase cml (shah et al. 2008)
and in advanced phases of the disease (pasquini
et al. 2007). first-line treatment of cml patients
with  xxxd1815xxx  has been assessed in an ongoing
phase ii trial (quintas-cardama et al. 2007b;
borthakur et al. 2008).

7.3.3.1
phase i dose escalation study
patients with chronic-phase cml, acceleratedand blast-phase cml, and also patients with ph+
all were enrolled in this study (ca180002).
the study population consisted of 84 patients, 72
of them resistant to imatinib. they were treated
with  xxxd1815xxx , ranging from 15 to 240 mg/day.
the drug was administered with different treatment schedules, from once daily in a weekly
schedule for 5 days on, 2 days off, up to continuous administration of the drug twice daily (talpaz
et al. 2006). hematologic remissions (hr) and
cytogenetic remissions (cr) were seen in all
phases of cml and in patients with ph+ all.
remissions were also seen with all bcr-abl
mutations, except t315i. on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results, a
twice-daily dosing schedule was chosen for subsequent  xxxd1815xxx  clinical trials.

7.3.3.2
phase ii: chronic phase cml (start c)
the start c trial (ca 180013), an international multicenter trial, investigated the efficacy
and safety of  xxxd1815xxx  in chronic phase cml
with imatinib resistance or intolerance. a median
follow-up of 8.3 months has been published for
186 patients (hochhaus et al. 2007b); this review
includes all 387 patients with a follow-up of
15.2 months (hochhaus et al. 2008a).
median time from diagnosis was 61 months.
previous treatment included ifn (65%), stem cell
transplantation (10%), prior imatinib of >600 mg/
day (55%), and /or imatinib for >3 years (53%).
bcr-abl mutations were present at baseline in
40% of the patients. of the 387 patients treated,
91% achieved or maintained a complete hematologic remission (chr). major and complete cytogenetic responses were observed in 59 and 49%
of the treated patients. response rates were higher
in patients intolerant to imatinib when compared
with those with imatinib resistance. cytogenetic
response rates were achieved irrespective of the
presence of bcr-abl mutations. median progression-free survival and overall survival were
not reached (table 7.1).
grade 3/4 cytopenias were observed mostly
in the initial phase of therapy, and included leukocytopenia (27%), neutropenia (49%), and
thrombocytopenia (48%). nonhematological
toxicities were generally mild to moderate. grade
3 pleural effusions occurred in 6% of patients.

7.3.3.3
accelerated phase cml (start a)
patients with accelerated phase cml, resistant
or intolerant to imatinib were enrolled into a multicenter study (start a, ca 180005). results
of 107 patients with a minimum follow-up of
8 months have been published (guilhot et al.
2007a); this review focuses on data with a median
follow-up of 14.1 months for the full cohort of

m. lindauer and a. hochhaus

174 patients (guilhot et al. 2007b). the median
time from diagnosis was 82 months, previous
treatment consisted of ifn (72%), stem cell
transplantation (13%), imatinib of >600 mg/day
(52%), and/or imatinib for >3 years (59%).
durable hematological and cr were observed in
a high proportion of patients. response rates
were achieved irrespective of prior allogeneic
hematologic stem cell transplantation and presence of bcr-abl mutations at baseline.
estimated 2-year progression-free survival was
46% and estimated 2-year overall survival was
72% (table 7.1). grade 3/4 cytopenias were
common (leukocytopenia 58%, neutropenia
75%, thrombocytopenia 81%). grade 3/4 pleural
effusions occurred in 5% of patients.

7.3.3.4
myeloid blast phase cml (start b) and lymphatic
blast phase cml (start l)
the start b and start l studies were multicenter single arm phase ii trials with identical
designs, enrolling patients with myeloid blast
crisis (start-b) and patients with lymphoid
blast crisis (start l) resistant or intolerant to
imatinib (cortes et al. 2007; cortes et al. 2008;
gambacorti et al. 2007). the majority of patients
(90%) were imatinib resistant. median time
from diagnosis of cml was 44 months.
in the start b trial (ca 180006), 109
patients were treated with a follow-up extending 20 months. previous treatment included
stem cell transplantation (14%), imatinib of
>600 mg/day (50%), and/or imatinib for >3
years (41%). a complete hematologic response
was achieved in 27% of patients; mcyr
occurred in 34%, with a complete cytogenetic
response in 26%, irrespective of baseline bcrabl mutation status (table 7.1). median duration of chr and mcyr had not been reached.

central nervous system disease of ph+

a recent report has shown substantial activity of
 xxxd1815xxx  in patients with ph+ all or blast phase
cml and central nervous system (cns) involvement. eleven adult and pediatric patients were
treated with  xxxd1815xxx  as first-line treatment for
cns leukemia, whereas three patients experienced a cns relapse while on  xxxd1815xxx  therapy
for other reasons. all of the 11 patients responded,

46 adult patients with ph+ all were treated months have been reported (porkka et al. 2008).
with  xxxd1815xxx . follow-up data at 8 months in
36 patients have been published (ottmann et al.
2007), an abstract is available with follow-up
data of 12 months in the full cohort of 46 7.3.3.7
patients (porkka et al. 2007). prior treatment randomized comparison of  xxxd1815xxx 
included stem cell transplantation (37%), ima- vs. high-dose imatinib (start r)
tinib of >600 mg/day (46%), or imatinib for >12
months (52%). median time from diagnosis of an international, randomized, open-label, phase

median time from diagnosis of cml was 59
months. all patients had been treated with imatinib, 67% of patients had been treated with doses
of >400 mg/day, and 40% of patients had received
the drug for 3 years or longer. further pretreatment included hydroxyurea (95%), ifn (71%),
and stem cell transplantation (6%). at baseline,
bcr-abl mutations were present in 45% of
patients randomized to receive  xxxd1815xxx , and in
22% of those in the high-dose imatinib arm.
after 12 weeks, a cytogenetic evaluation
was performed and patients either continued
therapy or crossed over if there was progression, lack of mcyr, or intolerance to the randomized therapy. after 12 weeks, a higher
proportion of patients on  xxxd1815xxx  had already
achieved a chr (93 vs. 82%, p = 0.034), mcyr
(36 vs. 29%, p > 0.4), and ccyr (22 vs. 8%,
p = 0.041). at a median follow-up of 15 months,
major (52 vs. 33%, p < 0.023) and complete (40
vs. 16%, p < 0.004) cytogenetic responses were
significantly better with  xxxd1815xxx , when compared to high-dose imatinib (kantarjian et al.
2007). in addition, in all the subgroups of prognostic interest, namely, prior treatment with
600 mg of imatinib daily, no prior cyr with
imatinib, and mutated bcr-abl, mcyrs and
ccyrs were consistently higher with respect to
 xxxd1815xxx  (table 7.2).
 xxxd1815xxx  was superior to high-dose imatinib
in terms of progression-free survival (p < 0.001).
grade 3/4 cytopenias were frequent and more
common in the  xxxd1815xxx  treatment group (neutropenia 61 vs. 39%, thrombocytopenia 56 vs.
14%) pleural effusions were reported only with
 xxxd1815xxx  (16 vs. 0%).

daily or 50 mg twice daily (quintas-cardama
et al. 2007b; borthakur et al. 2008). out of the 40
patients enrolled, 21 patients were randomized to
receive  xxxd1815xxx  once daily, and 19 to the twice
daily arm. dose escalations to 140 or 180 mg/day
for poor response, and dose reductions to 80 or
40 mg/day for toxicity were allowed. after 12
months, all evaluable patients (100%) had
achieved a ccyr (26 out of 26) and eight of the
25 evaluable patients (32%) had a major molecular response. according to the study investigators, these data are significantly better than
historical data from a similar group of patients
treated in studies at the md anderson cancer
center with imatinib of 400 or 800 mg/day.
transient grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia was
reported in 10%, neutropenia in 5%, and anemia
in 3% of patients. the most common nonhematological adverse events of grade 3/4 included
fatigue (5%), headache (3%), and rash (3%).
pleural effusions, all grade 1/2, occurred in five
patients (13%). treatment interruption and dose
reduction was required in 18 patients (46%).

randomized to receive  xxxd1815xxx  of 140 mg once
daily vs. 70 mg twice daily (pasquini et al.
2007). dose escalation was allowed for inadequate response, and dose reductions for toxicity.
in total, 611 patients were treated and had a
median follow-up of roughly 6 months. more
than one-third of these patients had previously
received imatinib therapy for more than 3 years,
43% had received high-dose imatinib, and 78%
were imatinib resistant. response rates were

100 mg once-daily arm was associated with a

the other three arms combined. in addition, there
were fewer interruptions or reductions, and fewer
patients discontinued treatment due to drugrelated toxicity in the 100 mg, once-daily arm.
the results from this study were the basis for the
new starting dose regimen of 100 mg once daily
in patients with chronic-phase cml resistant or
intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib.
the advantage of a once-daily schedule is most
probably based on a reduction of off-target inhibition associated with the short half-life of  xxxd1815xxx  in vivo.

patients in the once-daily schedule relapsed
after achieving a hematological response as in
the twice-daily regimen (30 vs. 16%). there
was a trend for improved tolerability with the

a recent phase ii study enrolled 46 patients with
metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer
and no prior chemotherapy. the starting dose of
 xxxd1815xxx  was changed from 100 mg twice daily
to 70 mg twice daily after the first 25 patients for
improved tolerability. a composite endpoint of
psa, bone scan, and disease control by recist
was applied.
an improved psa doubling time was seen in
29 of 36 patients (80.1%). one patient had a psa
decrease from 19.3 to 3.3 ng/ml. bone scans were
stable in 16 of 27 patients, and one was improved.
only 15 patients were evaluable for recist, and
10 of them (67%) had stable disease.
pleural effusions were reported in 17 of the
46 patients, and mostly grade 1–2, grade 3 leucopoenia occurred in 2% of patients (yu et al.
2008).

m. lindauer and a. hochhaus

most patients with imatinib intolerance in
chronic phase-cml tolerated treatment with
 xxxd1815xxx  well. in the phase ii single-arm study
in chronic-phase cml, three of the 99 imatinibintolerant patients had the same grade 3/4 nonhematological toxicity with  xxxd1815xxx , similar to
the prior imatinib; all the three patients continued  xxxd1815xxx  treatment after dose reduction.
the most frequently reported adverse reactions were fluid retention (including pleural
effusion), diarrhea, headache, nausea, skin rash,
dyspnea, hemorrhage, fatigue, musculoskeletal
pain, infection, vomiting, cough, abdominal
pain, and pyrexia (table 7.3).

7.3.5.1
hematological toxicity
myelosuppression is the most common toxicity
occurring under treatment with  xxxd1815xxx . hema­
tological toxicity is dependent on the disease
phase, as it is more severe in advanced phase disease. it is generally reversible and managed by
withholding treatment or dose reduction.

7.3.5
safety and tolerability
nearly all patients treated with  xxxd1815xxx  experience adverse reactions at some time. most reactions are mild to moderate. the tolerability of the
compound has been investigated in the abovementioned phase i, ii, and iii studies in patients
with cml. data of 2,182 patients enrolled in these
studies have been reported in the prescribing
information of  xxxd1815xxx  (bristol-myers squibb
2007). of the 2,182 patients treated, 25% were
³65 years of age, while 5% were ³75 years of age.
the median duration of the therapy was 11 months
(range 0.03–31 months). owing to adverse reactions,  xxxd1815xxx  had to be discontinued in 11% of
patients in chronic phase, and in 8–15% in advanced
disease.

7.3.5.2
fluid retention
 xxxd1815xxx  is frequently associated with fluid
retention. in all clinical studies, fluid retention
occurred in 20–30% of the patients. severe fluid
retention was reported in 9% of patients, including severe pleural (6%) and pericardial effusion
(1%). severe ascites and generalized edema
were each reported in <1% of patients. severe
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema was reported
in 1% of patients.
in a smaller series, pleural effusions occurred
with higher frequency in patients treated for
advanced cml (quintas-cardama et al. 2007a).
up to 36% of treated patients experienced

pleural effusion, with grade 3/4 in approximately 15% (cortes et al. 2008).
the pathomechanism for edema, pleural
effusion, and other fluid-retention adverse events
under  xxxd1815xxx  treatment is conflicting. it can be
speculated whether this might be related to the
off-target effect on  xxxg1710xxx -b kinase. mice deficient in  xxxg1710xxx -b develop edema (lindahl and
johannsson 1997), and a clinical trial assessing a
humanized pegylated  xxxg1710xxx -b blocking fabfragment in patients with ovarian and colorectal
cancer resulted in significant edema and pleural
effusion (jayson et al. 2005; quintas-cardama
et al. 2007a).
treatment of patients in chronic phase with
once-daily application of  xxxd1815xxx  had a significant lower incidence of pleural effusions
when compared to twice-daily administration
(shah et al. 2008).
management of edema, pleural effusion, and
fluid retention often requires stopping of  xxxd1815xxx  treatment. about 25% of patients require
therapeutic thoracocentesis. after lung manifestations have resolved, the drug can be reintroduced cautiously. corticosteroids may assist
in management, diuretics are also recommended, however, with only limited success
(quintas-cardama et al. 2007a).

7.3.5.3
bleeding
despite the high rate of thrombocytopenia,
bleeding episodes were rare. severe cns hemorrhage occurred in <1% of patients. eight cases
were fatal and five of them were associated with
ctc grade 4 thrombocytopenia.
severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred
in 4% of patients and generally required drug
interruptions and transfusions. other severe
hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. most
bleeding-related events were typically associated with severe thrombocytopenia.

m. lindauer and a. hochhaus

7.3.5.4
qt-prolongation
of the 2,182 patients who received  xxxd1815xxx  in
phase ii/iii clinical trials, 18 had qtc prolongation reported as an adverse event. seventeen
patients (<1%) experienced a qtcf of >500 ms.
 xxxd1815xxx  should be administered with caution to patients who have or may develop prolongation of qtc. these include patients with
hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, patients with
congenital long qt syndrome, patients taking
antiarrhythmic medication or other drugs which
lead to qt prolongation, and cumulative highdose anthracycline therapy.
hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be
corrected prior to  xxxd1815xxx  administration.

7.4
conclusion and further perspectives
 xxxd1815xxx  is approved for the treatment of
patients with ph+ cml or ph+ all, intolerant
or resistant to imatinib. clinical studies have
shown activity in patients with most imatinibresistant mutations of bcr-abl, except the
t315i mutation. high rates of hematologic and
cytogentic remissions, together with the prolongation of survival have been demonstrated.
starting dose in chronic phase is 100 mg daily,
while in advanced phases, 70 mg twice daily is
recommended. most patients experience side
effects, which are mostly mild to moderate and
manageable.
 xxxd1815xxx , like imatinib, does not have the
potential to eradicate the quiescent fraction of
stem cells, despite the fact that it targets earlier
bcr-abl-positive stem cells than imatinib
(copland et al. 2006). therefore, it is unlikely
that treatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and other tyrosine
kinase inhibitors will cure cml, and rather
treatment has to continue lifelong. since there
are no real long-term data till date for tyrosine

7

99

 xxxd1815xxx 

kinase inhibitors, even mild toxicity has to be of
concern. kinase inhibition occurs in all cells,
and it is not clear whether there will be some
kind of late toxicity.
in addition, emergence of resistance and
relapse poses a further concern, and indicates
that adaptation plays a role in the complex interaction between abl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition
and cml progression, a challenge that cannot
be solved solely by the development of new
bcr-abl inhibitors.
the outlook for long-term treatment is likely
to involve combination therapies with cytotoxic
agents, agents that target multiple sites within
the bcr-abl signal transduction pathway, or
even the reintroduction of ifn as immunotherapy.
it has been shown in a small cohort of patients
that, after remission induction in cml patients
with imatinib, ifn can safely be administered
as maintenance treatment (hochhaus et al.
2008b).
 xxxd1815xxx  outside cml and ph+ all is still
under investigation. treatment of patients with
ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders with
 xxxd1815xxx  generally induced only minimal improve­
ments, however, there were individual patients
experiencing very good remissions (verstovsek
et al. 2008).
in solid tumors, preclinical studies in numerous tumor cell lines with  xxxd1815xxx  showed
growth retardation or cell cycle arrest rather than
induction of apoptosis and cell death. therefore,
the preliminary results of clinical phase i and ii
studies in solid tumors with ‘stable disease’ as
best results were to be expected.
better responses to  xxxd1815xxx  in vitro have
been reported in selected cell lines or under certain circumstances. for example, triple negative
breast cancer cell lines responded better to  xxxd1815xxx  when compared to other types of breast cancer (finn et al. 2007); in lung cancer cell lines,
 xxxd1815xxx  activity was dependent on the epithelial
growth factor status (song et al. 2006), and  xxxd1815xxx  induced apoptosis in src-dependent osteosarcoma cell lines (shor et al. 2007).

hence, identification of predictive markers
for treatment response to  xxxd1815xxx  in solid
tumors will be of great importance. the results
of preclinical and clinical studies till date provide hope that  xxxd1815xxx  in biologically relevant
combination with other anticancer agents will
find a place in the treatment for at least some
tumors.
