anti-inflammatory activities of ldp-392, a dual paf receptor antagonist and  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor.  leukotrienes (lts) and  xxxd2973xxx  (paf) are important mediators of inflammation and allergy. ldp-392, a novel dual paf receptor antagonist and  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) inhibitor, has been identified. ldp-392 is 17.9-fold more potent than  xxxd3554xxx  ( xxxg147xxx  inhibitor) in the rbl cytosolic  xxxg147xxx  assay, and equally potent as mk 287 (paf receptor antagonist) in the human platelet paf receptor binding assay. the in vivo dual activities of ldp-392 were confirmed by measuring the inhibition of ex vivo ltb(4)production in rats and paf-induced hemoconcentration in mice. intravenous administration of ldp-392 demonstrated greater inhibition than  xxxd3554xxx , bn 50739 or mk 287 on  xxxd208xxx -induced ear edema and protected mice from lps-induced lethality. topical administration of ldp-392, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited tpa-induced ear edema in mice and uvb-induced erythema in guinea-pigs. these data suggest that ldp-392, as a dual paf receptor antagonist and  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor, may be of greater clinical effectiveness.
