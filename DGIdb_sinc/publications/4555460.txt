clinical evaluation of  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide
( xxxd184xxx ®), an anticholinergic drug
william h. bachrach, md
the administration of  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide to patients with a

variety of gastrointestinal disorders, most of which were functional gastroenteropathies, brought symptomatic relief only to a minority. these disappointing results were reflected further in the outcome of a double-blind
study in 100 patients in whom, when the randomized drug numbers were
decoded, therapeutic responses and side effects were not significantly
different from those of patients receiving a placebo.
this is a report of clinical observations on
 xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide ( xxxd184xxx ®), a
synthetic anticholinergic drug with the following formula:

the manufacturer* of this compound claims it
has special merit in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in that the drug ordinarily is free of side effects in clinically ameliorative dosage.

materials and methods
the drug was supplied for investigation in the following
forms: a) tablets containing 10 mg of  xxxd184xxx  methyl
bromide; b) an elixir containing 10 rag/5 ml and c) a series
of 100 batches of 1000 tablets each, randomly numbered
from 1 to 100, of which 50 were 10-mg tablets of  xxxd184xxx 
and 50 were a placebo.
 xxxd184xxx  was prescribed for patients with various gastrointestinal diseases. careful records were kept of the
symptomatic response and of side effects. the following
abbreviations were used in keeping records and retained in
from the mount sinai division, cedars-sinai medical
center, los angeles, calif.
the author wishes to thank endo laboratories for a
grant for this study and for generous supplies of  xxxd184xxx .

the tabulations in this paper:
ag = antral gastritis
du = duodenal ulcer
eso = esophagospasm
fbe = functional bowel syndrome; synonymous
with "irritable colon," "spastic colon" and
"unstable colon"
fd
= functional dyspepsia; ordinarily described
as "indigestion" or "hyperacidity"
fge = functional gastroenteropathy; symptoms referable to both the upper and lower gi tracts
gu = gastric ulcer
h h = hiatal hernia-esophagitis
ile = ileitis
mas = malabsorption syndrome
pan = pancreatitis
pgs = postgastrectomy syndrome
uc = ulcerative colitis
the symptomatic responses were classified as follows: a) asymptomatic: the primary complaint was
relieved completely; b) improved: the primary complaint was lessened to some degree, but not relieved
completely, as long as the patient was under treatment; c) temporary: symptoms improved at some
time, usually early in the therapeutic test, then recurred in spite of continued therapy; d) none: no improvement at all and e) worse: complaints were aggravated, either because original symptoms became
worse or new symptoms were added to those already
present,
the following scoring method was used to achieve
some objectivity in estimating the severity of side
effects. at each contact, the patient was asked what
effects he had noticed since taking the medication.

i. the patient did not mention spontaneously any side
effects, but admitted, on specific questioning regarding each
of the possible side effects, that he had experienced one or
more of them.
ii. t h e patient mentioned this side effect spontaneously,
but the side effect was not sufficiently severe for anything to
be done about it.
iii. t h e side effect was sufficiently severe that something
had to be done about it--eg, the patient was d r i n k i n g excessive amounts of water because his mouth was dry, or he
was chewing gum, or sucking on mints, or the dose of the
drug had to be lowered or spaced farther apart.
iv. t h e side effect was so severe that the drug had to be

discontinued. almost invariably the patient had already
stopped taking the drug by the time he reported such side
effects. also, these were usually central nervous system effects that included drowsiness, confusion, dizziness, nervousness or nausea.
t h e culmination of the clinical studies was a doubleblind investigation of 100 patients with a variety of gastrointestinal complaints, most on a functional basis. these
patients were told only that they were to be given one of the
relatively newer type drugs that for many years had been
indicated for symptoms such as theirs. subjects were not
told that this was an experimental study because: a) the
drug under investigation was already on the market and

thus was not an "experimental drug"; b) it was not considered desirable to inform patients they might be receiving
a placebo, because this knowledge might influence their
therapeutic response; c) patients were under very close observation and if clinical improvement was not forthcoming,
the medication was changed without delay; d) the patients
were not acutely ill; they were all outpatients, both clinic
and private, and the probability of their being harmed by
the anticholinergic drug or by the placebo was too remote to
deserve serious consideration and e) the treatment was almost invariably started with 1 tablet, 3 or 4 times daily
which, on the basis of the results of the preliminary study on
30 patients, was a very small dose for this drug.

results

clinical observations were carried out on 30
patients receiving  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide
tablets (table 1). seven of the patients were relieved of symptoms while on this therapy;
however 2 of these were simultaneously taking
antacids for duodenal ulcer, so that a response
may not be attributable entirely to the anticholinergic. among the 7 patients with favorable results, 3 experienced no side effects; 2 of
these 3 patients took as many as 6 tablets, 4
times daily. in 6 of the patients in this part of
the clinical study, relief was not forthcoming
with doses of 6 tablets or more, 4 times daily.
one patient with a duodenal ulcer, who very
faithfully took his medication, took 10 tablets, 4
times a day during an exacerbation; he was not
relieved and had to be hospitalized to bring the
attack under control.
 xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide in the form of

an elixir was given to 8 patients, in doses ranging from as little as 6 drops before meals to 1
ounces every 4 hours (table 2). in 2 patients
with diarrhea as their chief complaint, the
diarrhea became worse while taking the elixir.
of the remaining 6 patients, 3 developed diarrhea after starting this form of anistropine
methyl bromide. none of the patients were relieved of their p r i m a r y complaints.
t h e double-blind clinical study of  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide included 100 patients;
however, 3 of the same-numbered medications
were given to 2 patients each, making a total of
103 patients. t h e distribution of the patient
population and diagnoses for the groups receiving  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide and those receiving the placebo were comparable (table 3).
t h e results of the double-blind study (table
4) indicate that less than 10% of patients receiving the active drug experienced complete
relief of symptoms. this figure is twice that of
the placebo group, but the numbers are too
small (4 and 2) to be significant. conversely, in
the placebo group, nearly twice as many patients showed no improvement as in the anticholinergic group, and here the numbers are
more meaningful (20 as opposed to 13). however, the possible significance of this finding is
offset by the observation that, of patients reporting a worsening of their health while taking
the tablets, 10 were receiving  xxxd184xxx 
methyl bromide and 3 were receiving the
placebo. in the case of the active drug, this was

primarily due to an intolerance for the medication. more patients were improved on  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide than on the placebo,
but the difference is not statistically significant.
temporary relief occurred more frequently on
the placebo. summarizing the findings in table
5, it is apparent that under the circumstances of
this t h e r a p e u t i c trial, a n i s o t r o p i n e m e t h y l
bromide was not significantly more effective
than a dummy preparation.
this conclusion was corroborated by another
analysis made in the course of the study. as the
observations were completed on each patient,
digestive diseases, vol. 17, no. 6 (june 1972)

the author made a prediction as to whether,
when the code was broken, the tablets would be
the active drug or a placebo. the tablet was
designated as probably representing the active
drug if the patient had a clear therapeutic
benefit, or had side effects, or responded to the
test drug in a manner comparable to his response to a known anticholinergic drug, given
after the therapeutic test with  xxxd184xxx 
methyl bromide was completed. there were 12
patients who could not be evaluated, leaving 91
in whom a prediction was made (table 5).
among 41 patients whose response to the pills
509

bachrach

suggested they were receiving the placebo, 21
were actually receiving  xxxd184xxx  methyl
bromide and 20 the placebo. among 50 in
whom the responses indicated the patients were
receiving the active drug, there were 26 on  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide and 24 on the
placebo.
among the patients receiving the placebo
tablets, yet reacting as though they were receiving an active drug, there were 16 with apparently reliable reports of side effects (table 6). in
3 patients the side effect consisted of some
dryness of the mouth; this is hardly remarkable, since a dry mouth is possible without
medication. in 1 patient, however, the complaint was that the pills "dried my mouth like
cotton." in another patient, the dryness was
described as equal to that experienced on a dose
of 0.4 mg atropine; for this reason, the author
inferred the patient was taking an active anticholinergic. one patient, in addition to a dry
mouth, experienced weakness, dizziness and
blurring of vision; however, since all of these
side effects were still present 4 days after the
drug was stopped, it is unlikely that the pills,
placebo or not, had anything to do with it.
there are, however, some instances of side effects on the placebo which are inexplicable. a
man with a duodenal ulcer complained the pills
were blurring his vision to the extent that it interfered with his work; after discontinuing the
medication, this problem disappeared. t h e
visual impairment could not be blamed on the
antacid he was taking simultaneously, because
he continued to take the same antacid after he
stopped the pills. a woman being treated for an
irritable colon syndrome took her first 2 tablets
at 6 pm, just before dinner; within 2 hours she
developed a generalized itching eruption which
subsided over the next 3 days on an antihistamine. she denied having eaten anything unusual at the meal preceding the appearance of
the rash, and she refused to try the tablets
again. a woman with a functional gastroenteropathy developed blurring of the vision when
the dose reached 5 tablets before meals and at
510

bedtime; the pills were stopped and the blurring disappeared completely, but the patient
reported that she did not feel as well because the
pills had helped her indigestion.
of the total number of side effects observed at
least once for all patients, 62 occurred on  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide and 66 on placebo.
xerostomia occurred 16 times in each group.
thirty-three  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide
patients and 30 placebo patients exhibited at
least one side effect.
of the side effects graded iii or iv, 31 occurred on  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide and 24
on placebo. seventeen patients on  xxxd184xxx 
methyl bromide and 13 on placebo showed at
least one such side effect.
eleven patients in the placebo group and 12
patients in the  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide
group showed increased side effects with increased dosage.
a surgeon being treated for ileitis took up to
6  xxxd184xxx  tablets, 4 times daily for 3 days, with
only occasional, moderate dryness of the mouth.
a research physiologist under treatment for a
duodenal ulcer was asked to take  xxxd184xxx 
methyl bromide tablets before the evening meal
and at bedtime, in whatever dose was required
to produce perceptible side effects. his mouth
became dry at a dose of 10 tablets (100 mg), before dinner and at bedtime. he also found that
he required 1.6 mg atropine to obtain a corresponding degree of dryness; however, the effect
of the bedtime dos'e of atropine carried over into
the morning, whereas the effect of the ]00 mg
 xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide did not.
in a number of other patients, a comparison
(table 7) between the side effects of  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide and atropine was possible,
although not with the precision achieved in the
case just cited. in most instances, from 100 to
150 times as much  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide
was required to produce the same effect, usually
dryness, as was obtained with atropine.
that the aim of following the patients carefully was accomplished is evident from table 8,

is accounted for by the greater number of patients on  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide than on

drug or because of unacceptable side effects

discussion

the most striking aspect of our observations
is that, while physiologic studies in both animal
and human subjects show  xxxd184xxx  methyl
bromide undoubtedly has the conventional
properties of an anticholinergic drug, a doubleblind clinical study in 100 patients failed to
distinguish clearly between this drug and a
placebo in the treatment of primarily functional
bowel disorders. a possible explanation may be
found in the nature of the case material. a
group of patients with a similar distribution of
diagnoses fared no better under treatment with
known  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide than they
did after taking the same drug under doubleblind conditions; this would suggest that the
patients who entered into these studies were refractory to any therapeutic efforts. on the other
hand, if anticholinergics, by virtue of their antispasmodic properties, cannot contribute materially to the management of the functional
gastroenteropathies, in what diseases can they
find a firm indication? this problem has been
discussed elsewhere (1) and it was concluded
that no scientific proof has been submitted of
the clinical efficacy of anticholinergic drugs, as
yet.
another difficulty in demonstrating that a
drug of known pharmacologic characteristics is
clinically effective lies in the fact that patients
respond to placebos, both symptomatically and
with side effects; a scholarly review of this
phenomenon has been contributed by wolf (2).
the incidence of favorable responses to placebo
medication might diminish if treatment could be
executed by computers, since patients with
functional gastrointestinal disorders often have
underlying emotional problems, and the doctorpatient situation inevitably influences the patient's response to.the prescribed drugs. for this
reason, the question has been raised whether a
great part of the benefits derived from drugs is
not merely a function of the therapeutic situation, rather than the drugs' pharmacologic actions. perhaps an improvement on the conven512

tional design of the double-blind study would
consist of treating a large series of patients with
placebos, eliminating the "placebo reactors'-'
and performing the double-blind study on the
others.
a third consideration is that a double-blind
study is necessarily a statistical study; it does
not take account of the likelihood that in a certain number of patients who improve while
taking a drug, the treatment is beneficial because of the drug and not because of the patient's reaction to the doctor or to other factors
in the therapeutic situation. in a large doubleblind study, these patients are diluted by those
who respond primarily to the interest of the
doctor and who, therefore, do just as well on the
placebo.
in t r e a t i n g p e o p l e with a n t i c h o l i n e r g i c
drugs, if a symptomatic response is not forthcoming at the unit dose, one is not sure that a
therapeutic level has been reached; one therefore increases the dose until some side effect occurs which signals the achievement of a true
anticholinergic effect. with  xxxd184xxx  methyl bromide, this dose is often in the range of 5
or 6 tablets, 4 times a day, an impractical way
to prescribe medication. on the basis of these
observations, the author recommended that a
trial be undertaken with a larger unit dose-eg, a 50-mg scored tablet. there is nothing in
the observations made thus far to support the
idea that a 10-mg tablet of this preparation has
the necessary phai'macologic action to produce
a clinical result. also, there is nothing in the
observations reported here, or elsewhere in the
literature, to indicate that this synthetic preparation has any advantage over the much less
expensive  xxxd247xxx ; nor has this been
shown for any of the other synthetic anticholinergics.
