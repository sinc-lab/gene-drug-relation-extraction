l-serine can be deaminated by a variety of enzymes of varying degrees of specificity, producing pyruvate and ammonia
(see scheme 1). as described in the swiss-prot data base, these
enzymes fall into two families, the serine/threonine deaminases ( xxxg1016xxx .19) and the bacterial l-serine deaminases (ec
4.3.1.17). the first of these, the serine/threonine deaminases,
require pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate as a cofactor in catalysis. en-

zymes within this family that have been characterized to any
significant extent include the mammalian liver  xxxg2043xxx , which serves a gluconeogenic function (1, 2), and the
biosynthetic threonine deaminase ( xxxg1016xxx .19), which is encoded by the ilva gene of escherichia coli. this enzyme deaminates either serine or threonine (3) and is essential for isoleucine biosynthesis. a second threonine deaminase, the biodegradative enzyme, which is encoded by the tdcb gene of
e. coli, uses the same cofactor, as does  xxxd5xxx  deaminase of
e. coli (4.3.1.18) (4 – 6). moreover, serine is deaminated by
enzymes of varying physiological function, including cystathionine ␥-synthase (7) and the ␤ subunit of tryptophan synthase
(8). the mechanism of all these enzymes is well understood.
the role of the pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate cofactor is to facilitate
removal of the ␣-proton of the bound amino acid, allowing for a
␤-elimination of the hydroxyl group as water. tautomerization
of the resulting ␣-aminoacrylate results in 2-iminopropionic
acid, which is hydrolyzed to ammonia and pyruvate (9).
by contrast, the bacterial l-serine deaminases (lsds)1 are
activated by iron and are not as well characterized (10, 11).
this family of enzymes is exclusively prokaryotic and widespread in bacteria, although not omnipresent. in fact, many
bacteria elaborate one to three lsds. in e. coli these proteins
are encoded by the sdaa, sdab, and tdcg genes (12–14); the
corresponding protein products are designated as lsd1, lsd2,
and tdcg, respectively. all three proteins are very similar in
primary structure; lsd2 and tdcg exhibit 77 and 78% identity
with lsd1. in contrast to lsd1 and lsd2, tdcg is synthesized
only during anaerobic growth (12).
the manner in which expression and/or function of these
enzymes is regulated is known in some detail, but the mechanism of catalysis is not. lsd1 has been moderately characterized (13, 15, 16). it contains 454 amino acids, including 9
cysteines (13). when purified aerobically, the enzyme is inactive until incubated with iron and dtt under aerobic conditions. these characteristics make it very similar to the lsds
from clostridium acidiurici (17), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (18), and clostridium propionicum (19), which are all
activated in the same manner. electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopic studies on the p. asaccharolyticus
enzyme indicate the presence of [3fe-4s]⫹ clusters (20). it is
believed, however, that the catalytically active form of the
enzyme contains a [4fe-4s] cluster, in light of the striking
similarities between the proposed reaction mechanism of the

l-serine deaminases catalyze the deamination of lserine, producing pyruvate and ammonia. two families
of these proteins have been described and are delineated by the cofactor that each employs in catalysis.
these are the pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate-dependent deaminases and the deaminases that are activated in vitro by
iron and dithiothreitol. in contrast to the enzymes that
employ pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate, detailed physical and
mechanistic characterization of the iron-dependent
deaminases is limited, primarily because of their extreme instability. we report here the characterization of
 xxxg2043xxx  from escherichia coli, which is the
product of the sdaa gene. when purified anaerobically,
the isolated protein contains 1.86 ⴞ 0.46 eq of iron and
0.670 ⴞ 0.019 eq of sulfide per polypeptide and displays a
uv-visible spectrum that is consistent with a [4fe-4s]
cluster. reconstitution of the protein with iron and sulfide generates considerably more of the cluster, and
treatment of the reconstituted protein with dithionite
gives rise to an axial epr spectrum, displaying g储 ⴝ 2.03
and g⬜ ⴝ 1.93. mössbauer spectra of the 57fe-reconstituted protein reveal that the majority of the iron is in
the form of [4fe-4s]2ⴙ clusters, as evidenced by the typical mössbauer parameters-isomer shift, ␦ ⴝ 0.47 mm/s,
quadrupole splitting of ⌬eq ⴝ 1.14 mm/s, and a diamagnetic (s ⴝ 0) ground state. treatment of the dithionitereduced protein with l-serine results in a slight broadening of the feature at g ⴝ 2.03 in the epr spectrum of
the protein, and a dramatic loss in signal intensity, suggesting that the amino acid interacts directly with the
cluster.

iron-dependent lsds and  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx , which has been studied in
detail using a variety of spectroscopic techniques (10, 21).
herein, we use a variety of spectroscopic methods to show that
treatment of lsd1 with iron and sulfide results in formation of
a [4fe-4s] cluster on the protein and that this state of the
protein is essential for catalysis. reconstituted lsd1 catalyzes
the deamination of l-serine with a first-order rate constant
(kcat) of 436 s⫺1, and a km value of 2.67 ⫾ 0.25 mm. it will also
deaminate  xxxd3361xxx  and l-allo-threonine, albeit with greatly
reduced efficiency; however,  xxxd5xxx  and l-cysteine are not
substrates but serve as competitive inhibitors. additionally,
analyses of epr spectra recorded on the dithionite-reduced
protein in the presence of various substrates and inhibitors are
consistent with a direct role in catalysis for the iron-sulfur
(fe/s) cluster as opposed to a simple structural element.

an extinction coefficient for apo-lsd1, which in turn was used to correct
the bradford dye-staining protein assay.
routine gel-filtration of lsd1 was carried out in a coy laboratory
products (grass lake, mi) anaerobic chamber using sephadex g-25
resin (amersham biosciences). when it was necessary to concentrate
the protein, it was carried out using an amicon stirred-cell ultrafiltration device (millipore, billerica, ma) in combination with a ym-10
membrane, which has a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kda. ultrafiltration
was carried out inside of the anaerobic chamber by threading the tubing
from the nitrogen source through one of the chamber’s ports.
overexpression and purification of lsd1—a 200-ml overnight culture of e. coli bl21(de3) containing plasmid psdaah6 in terrific broth
(100 ␮g ml⫺1 ampicillin) was used to inoculate 16 liters of the same
media, which was divided evenly among four 6-liter erlenmeyer flasks.
plasmid psdaah6 contains the sdaa gene cloned as a fusion construct
with a carboxyl-terminal 6⫻ histidine tag that is separated from the
last amino acid of the protein by a linker of 2 amino acid residues. the
cultures were grown at 37 °c with gentle shaking (200 rpm) and induced at an a600 of 0.5 by addition of solid isopropyl-␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 400 ␮m. at induction, solid fecl3
was also added to each flask to a final concentration of 50 ␮m. expression of the sdaa gene was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 37 °c, after
which, the cultures were placed in an ice-water bath for 30 min. the
bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻ g and
4 °c, yielding ⬃30 g of cells from 16 liters of cell culture after freezing
in liquid nitrogen.
lsd1 was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography
using a nickel- xxxd2739xxx  matrix (qiagen, valencia, ca). all
steps were carried out inside of the anaerobic chamber under an atmosphere of n2 and h2 (95%/5%), wherein the o2 concentration was
maintained below 1 ppm via the use of palladium catalysts. steps
involving centrifugation were carried out outside of the anaerobic
chamber; however, samples were loaded into appropriate centrifuge
bottles and tightly sealed before removing them. in a typical purification, 30 g of cells was thawed in 60 ml of buffer a (50 mm hepes, ph
7.5, 100 mm nacl, 1 mm dtt, 20 mm imidazole) and allowed to incubate
with lysozyme (1 mg ml⫺1) for 30 min at room temperature. subsequent
to chilling on ice, the cells were lysed by sonic disruption in 4 ⫻ 1-min
bursts, and the lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 ⫻ g for 1 h at 4 °c. the
supernatant was loaded onto a nickel- xxxd2739xxx  column (2.5 ⫻
7 cm) that was equilibrated in buffer a, and the column was washed
with 50 ml of buffer a containing 10% glycerol and 40 mm imidazole.
finally, the protein was eluted with buffer a containing 10% glycerol
and 250 mm imidazole. fractions that displayed a brown color were
pooled and concentrated using an amicon stirred-cell and exchanged
into buffer b (50 mm epps, ph 8.0, 100 mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm
dtt) by anaerobic gel filtration. the protein was routinely frozen in
small aliquots and stored in liquid n2 until ready for use.
reconstitution of serine deaminase—reconstitution of lsd1 with
iron and sulfide was carried out inside of the anaerobic chamber with
buffers and solutions that were prepared with deoxygenated water. a
typical reconstitution reaction contained 100 ␮m lsd1, and 8-fold molar excesses of fecl3 and na2s in a final volume of 2 ml. the protein
was initially treated with a 50-fold molar excess of dtt for 10 min on
ice. the fecl3 was added, and then a solution of na2s was added
dropwise over 10 min. the mixture was allowed to stir gently on ice for
4 h in the anaerobic chamber. it was then placed in centrifuge tubes,
capped, and centrifuged at 20,000 ⫻ g for 20 min at 4 °c. it was brought
back into the anaerobic chamber, and the supernatant was removed
and exchanged into buffer b by anaerobic gel filtration.
activity determination for serine deaminase—lsd1 was first diluted to a final concentration of 5 ␮m in buffer b containing 50%
glycerol. a typical reaction contained in a final volume of 1 ml: 0.2 mm
nadh, 10 units of ldh, 0 –20 mm l-serine, 100 mm epps, ph 8.0, and
55 nm lsd1. the reaction mixture was prepared inside the anaerobic
chamber; all of its components were anaerobic except for ldh. however, the volume of ldh added to the reaction mixture was 1% of the
total volume. the reaction mixture, excluding lsd1, was incubated for
3–5 min at 37 °c in a septum-sealed anaerobic cuvette (starna,
atascadero, ca), and the reaction was initiated by injection of lsd1 via
a gas-tight syringe. enzyme turnover was monitored by a time-dependent decrease in absorption at 340 nm (⑀340 ⫽ 6.22 ⫻ 103 m⫺1 cm⫺1),
which is due to nadh oxidation. one unit of activity is defined as 1
␮mol of nad⫹ produced per minute. when turnover with  xxxd3361xxx ,
l-cysteine, l-allo-threonine, or  xxxd5xxx  was monitored, the concentration of lsd1 in the assay was increased to 5.5 ␮m. the kinetic parameters km and vmax were obtained from fits of initial rate data as a
function of serine concentration according to equation 1. in some in-

materials—l-serine and dithiothreitol (dtt) were obtained from
icn biomedicals inc.  xxxd3361xxx , l-cysteine, lactate dehydrogenase
(ldh), sodium sulfide (nonahydrate), molecular weight standards for
gel filtration, and ferric chloride were obtained from sigma. sodium
hydrosulfite (dithionite), potassium ferricyanide, and l-allo-threonine
were obtained from aldrich. bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) standard and
the bradford reagent for protein quantification were purchased from
pierce (rockford, il). nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced
form) was obtained from roche applied science. tryptone and yeast
extract were obtained from marcor development (carlstadt, nj) and
biospringer usa (milwaukee, wi), respectively. 57fe metal (97–98%)
was obtained from pennwood chemicals (great neck, ny). it was
washed with chcl3 and dissolved with heating in an anaerobic solution
of 1 m h2so4 (1.5 mol of h2so4 per mol of 57fe). upon dissolution, the
ph of the solution was raised to ⬃4.5 by the addition of solid sodium
bicarbonate immediately before the reconstitution procedure.
spectroscopic methods—uv-visible spectra were recorded on cary 50
or cary 300 spectrometers (varian, walnut creek, ca), employing the
associated winuv software package. the cary 300 was equipped with
a 6 ⫻ 6 peltier-thermostattable multicell holder and an associated
temperature controller.
low temperature x-band epr spectra were recorded in perpendicular mode on a bruker (billerica, ma) esp300 spectrometer equipped
with an er 041 mr microwave bridge and a 4102st resonator. sample
temperature was maintained with an itc503s temperature controller
and an esr900 liquid helium cryostat (oxford instruments, concord,
ma). spin concentration was determined by double integration of the
sample spectrum obtained under non-saturating conditions and comparing the resulting intensity to that of a standard (1 mm cuso4, 10 mm
edta) obtained under identical conditions. general spectral manipulations were performed on personal computers using the winepr
software package (bruker) or the igor pro software package
(wavemetrics).
mössbauer spectra were recorded on spectrometers from web research (edina, mn) operating in the constant acceleration mode in a
transmission geometry. spectra were recorded with the temperature of
the sample maintained at 4.2 k. for low field spectra, the sample was
kept inside an svt-400 dewar from janis (wilmington, ma), and a
magnetic field of 40 millitesla was applied parallel to the ␥-beam. for
high field spectra, the sample was kept inside a 12svt dewar (janis),
which houses a superconducting magnet that allows for application of
variable magnetic fields between 0 and 8 tesla parallel to the ␥-beam.
the quoted isomer shifts are relative to the centroid of the spectrum of
a metallic foil of ␣-fe at room temperature. data analysis was performed using the program wmoss from web research.
analytical procedures and assays—protein concentration was determined by the bradford dye-staining procedure with bsa as the standard (22). as determined in this work, this method overestimates the
true concentration of lsd1 by a factor of 1.35. routine chemical analyses of iron and sulfide were carried out by the methods of beinert
(23–25). the method of gill and von hippel (26) was used to establish

results

purification and characterization of serine deaminase—the
iron-dependent serine deaminases have been reported to be
unstable, losing activity quickly during purification, and to
some extent, even in the cell (28 –30). to maximize purification
of active enzyme, the protein was expressed as a fusion construct with a carboxyl-terminal 6⫻ histidine appendage and
purified under anaerobic conditions inside an anaerobic chamber. the eluted protein was light brown in color, and its uvvisible spectrum displayed features, although not prominent,
that are consistent with the presence of an fe/s cluster (fig. 1,
solid line). among these features, the shoulder at 320 nm and
the hump at 416 nm are the most defining, as is the broad
tailing that extends beyond 700 nm.
an extinction coefficient was determined using apo-lsd1
and the procedure of gill and von hippel and was used to
correct the bradford dye-binding protein assay. it was found
that the bradford assay, using bsa as a standard, overestimates the concentration of lsd1 by a factor of 1.35. analysis of
subsequent aliquots of the as-isolated protein indicated the
presence of 1.86 ⫾ 0.46 eq of iron and 0.670 ⫾ 0.019 eq of
sulfide per polypeptide using the bradford correction factor.

the quoted uncertainties are the standard deviation of three
independent analyses, and they reflect the individual uncertainties of the protein concentration and the iron and sulfide
concentration. the uv-visible spectrum of the reconstituted
protein is also shown in fig. 1 (dashed line). it displays prominent features at 316 and 407 nm. importantly, the ratio of the
feature at 278 nm to that at 407 nm (2.56) decreased significantly from its value in the as-isolated protein (8.33). these
features, in combination with the overall spectral envelope of
the protein, are most consistent with the formation of [4fe-4s]
clusters upon reconstitution, although it must be emphasized
that the types and relative amounts of different fe/s cluster
species cannot be determined with great accuracy from uvvisible spectra. to quantitatively determine the composition of
the fe/s cluster(s) in reconstituted lsd1, mössbauer and epr
spectroscopic experiments were carried out as described below.
spectroscopic characterization of reconstituted serine
deaminase—shown in fig. 2a is the mössbauer spectrum of
57
fe-reconstituted lsd1 recorded at 4.2 k in an externally
applied magnetic field of 40 millitesla oriented parallel to the
␥-beam. the prominent features of this spectrum are two sharp
lines of similar intensity at ⫺0.13 and ⫹1 mm/s, and a broad
peak at 2.7 mm/s. in addition, there is a featureless component
extending from ⫺6 to ⫹6 mm/s, and a pronounced shoulder at
0.55 mm/s, which is denoted by an arrow. the two lines at
⫺0.13 and ⫹1 mm/s belong to a quadrupole doublet of isomer
shift, ␦ ⫽ 0.47 mm/s, and quadrupole splitting, ⌬eq ⫽ 1.14
mm/s. these parameters are consistent with the presence of
[4fe-4s]2⫹ clusters associated with the protein. the shoulder
at ⫹0.55 mm/s is at a position that is typical of the high energy
line of a quadrupole doublet originating from [2fe-2s]2⫹ clusters, thus raising the possibility that this cluster form is also
present in the sample. the broad component ranging from ⫺6
to ⫹6 mm/s, and the peak at 2.7 mm/s, are often caused by
adventitiously bound iron species in samples of reconstituted
fe/s proteins. alternatively, these features could arise from
paramagnetic fe/s cluster species, such as [2fe-2s]⫹, [3fe4s]⫹, and [4fe-4s]⫹ clusters. it is not possible to distinguish
and quantify small amounts of these fe/s cluster forms using
mössbauer spectroscopy alone if they are present. however, the
[2fe-2s]⫹, [3fe-4s]⫹, and [4fe-4s]⫹ clusters all have an s ⫽
1/2 electronic ground state and exhibit characteristic epr spectra. consequently, we recorded the epr spectrum of reconsti-

molecular sieve chromatography of lsd1—molecular sieve chromatography of lsd1 was performed under anaerobic conditions with an
⌬kta (amersham biosciences) fast-performance liquid chromatography system, which was maintained inside a coy anaerobic chamber.
the fast-performance liquid chromatography system was equipped with
a hiprep 16/60 sephacryl s-200 hr column (amersham biosciences)
and was controlled with the associated software program unicorn,
which was also used for data collection and analysis. the column was
equilibrated in an anaerobic solution of buffer b, and samples (250 ␮m)
and standards (2–10 mg ml⫺1) were chromatographed at a flow rate of
1 ml min⫺1 over a time span of 120 min. the proteins,  xxxg569xxx 
(12.4 kda), carbonic anhydrase (29 kda), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (66
kda),  xxxg110xxx  (150 kda), and ␤-amylase (200 kda), were
used to generate a standard curve of known molecular masses, and the
void volume (v0) of the column was determined using blue dextran
(2000 kda). the elution volumes (ve) of the standards were obtained,
and the ratios of ve v0⫺1 were plotted against the log of their respective
molecular masses. the standard curve was then used to extrapolate the
apparent molecular weight of reconstituted lsd1 from its elution
volume.
preparation of samples for epr and mössbauer spectroscopy—samples of lsd1 suitable for epr or mössbauer spectroscopy were prepared
inside of the anaerobic chamber. epr samples contained 200 –300 ␮m
enzyme in buffer b, were treated with 2 mm (final concentration)
sodium dithionite, and frozen immediately in cold isopentane (⫺150 °c)
sitting in a dewar of liquid nitrogen. in some samples, l-serine, lthreonine, or l-cysteine (20 mm each) was added to the reduced protein
before freezing. in all cases, the amount of time that elapsed between
the addition of dithionite (and the substrate when appropriate) and the
freezing of the sample was less than 30 s.
mössbauer spectra were recorded on proteins that contained 57fe in
place of natural-abundance iron. in all samples, the 57fe was incorporated into the protein via reconstitution, as described above, and samples contained 250 –350 ␮m protein, and 20 mm  xxxd3361xxx  when appropriate. samples were frozen within 30 s after adding the substrate to
the enzyme.

tuted lsd1 in the absence of dithionite. the spectrum reveals
the presence of a small fraction of [3fe-4s]⫹ clusters, which
amounts to 0.02 eq of spin per polypeptide, corresponding to
0.7% of the total iron in the sample (fig. 3, inset). such small
quantities are beyond the detection limit of mössbauer spectroscopy and can be neglected for the data analysis. the characteristic features of [2fe-2s]⫹ and [4fe-4s]⫹ clusters are not
observed in the epr spectrum of reconstituted lsd1 in the
absence of dithionite. therefore, the broad absorption in the
mössbauer spectrum is attributed to adventitiously bound fe.
to determine the parameters and relative amount of the
[4fe-4s]2⫹ cluster, and to assess the presence of the [2fe-2s]2⫹
clusters more rigorously, the spectral envelope was analyzed by
fitting the region from ⫺1 to ⫹2 mm/s. initially, we fitted the
data to only one quadrupole doublet; however, the fit becomes
poor at ⬃0.5 mm/s, which corresponds to the location of the
shoulder. inclusion of a second quadrupole doublet significantly improves the quality of the fit. the more intense quadrupole doublet accounts for 50 ⫾ 5% of the total absorption
and has parameters, ␦ ⫽ 0.47 mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 1.14 mm/s, that
are indicative of the configuration [4fe-4s]2⫹. the less intense
quadrupole doublet (10 ⫾ 5% of the total absorption) has parameters, ␦ ⫽ 0.28 mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 0.59 mm/s, that are
indicative of the configuration [2fe-2s]2⫹. we emphasize that
the parameters for the latter component have a greater uncertainty, because its spectral features are overshadowed by the
absorption features emanating from the [4fe-4s]2⫹ clusters as
well as the adventitiously bound fe, of which the exact shape is
not known. shown as a solid line overlaid with the experimental data in fig. 2a is the result of the least squares fit; the
individual spectral components of the [4fe-4s]2⫹ and [2fe2s]2⫹ clusters are plotted above the data as dashed and dotted
lines, respectively.
to substantiate the presence of [4fe-4s]2⫹ and [2fe-2s]2⫹
clusters in reconstituted lsd1, we recorded a mössbauer spectrum in an externally applied field of 8 tesla oriented parallel to
the ␥-beam (fig. 2b). [4fe-4s]2⫹ and [2fe-2s]2⫹ clusters have

diamagnetic (s ⫽ 0) ground states, resulting in no internal
magnetic fields at 4.2 k. therefore, it is expected that the
effective magnetic field at the 57fe nuclei would equal the
externally applied field. the solid line overlaid with the experimental data in fig. 2b is a simulation using the parameters
described above and assuming diamagnetism (s ⫽ 0). the
individual components are shown as dashed ([4fe-4s]2⫹) and
dotted lines ([2fe-2s]2⫹) above the data. the quality of the
simulation is excellent, and it corroborates the presence of
[4fe-4s]2⫹ and [2fe-2s]2⫹ clusters.
epr spectra of the reconstituted enzyme are consistent with
the configurations and stoichiometries of fe/s species determined by mössbauer spectroscopy. in the absence of dithionite,
the enzyme displays a weak and fairly isotropic signal centered
at g ⫽ 2.019, which accounts for 0.02 eq of spin and which is not
observed at temperatures above 50 k at 5-milliwatt power (fig.
3, inset), suggesting that the signal emanates from [3fe-4s]⫹
clusters. other fe/s cluster species are not detected. from the

broader axial signal, displaying g㛳 ⫽ 2.03 and g⬜ ⫽ 1.93 (fig. 3).
quantification of the spin concentration of the signal indicates
that it accounts for 78 ␮m spin, or 0.3 eq with respect to the
protein. a study of the temperature dependence of the signal at
5 milliwatts of microwave power (data not shown) indicates
that it is maximal at 13 k and then broadens considerably such
that it is no longer visible at temperatures above 45 k. this
behavior suggests that the paramagnetic signal derives from a
[4fe-4s]⫹ cluster and that the [2fe-2s]2⫹ clusters that are
observed by mössbauer spectroscopy are not reduced under the
described experimental conditions. this conclusion stems from
the inability to observe a signal above 45 k and the generally
accepted dictum that most [2fe-2s] clusters are slow relaxing
and observable by epr at temperatures above 77 k (31).

an iron-sulfur cluster in serine deaminase

activity was measured by monitoring the ldh-dependent reduction of pyruvate to lactate at the expense of nadh. ldh
will also act on ␣-ketobutyrate, producing 2-hydroxybutyrate
(32), and allowing turnover of  xxxd3361xxx  or l-allo-threonine to
be monitored by the same method. in the presence of 55 nm
enzyme and varying concentrations of l-serine, the reactions
were quite fast and, depending on the substrate concentration,
usually complete (all of the substrate was consumed) within 3
min of initiation. in some cases, small, but discernible lags
were present; however, proper controls indicated that they did
not derive from an insufficient amount of the coupling enzyme
in the assay. we attribute the lags to either assembly of fe/s
clusters onto polypeptides that are insufficiently reconstituted,
or a slow oligomerization of polypeptides to the active quaternary structure, which is facilitated in the presence of substrate.
in fig. 4, a plot of the initial rate as a function of l-serine
concentration is displayed, the inset depicting the lineweaverburk representation of the data. a fit of the data to equation 1
allowed extraction of the kinetic constants kcat (436 s⫺1) and
km (2.67 ⫾ 0.25 mm). in the presence of 20 mm substrate, lsd1
catalyzed deamination of  xxxd3361xxx  and l-allo-threonine with
rates of 0.038 and 0.065 ␮mol min⫺1, as compared with 128
␮mol min⫺1 for l-serine under identical conditions. (note that
these rates are normalized for the enzyme concentration that
was used in each study.) as expected, the enzyme did not
catalyze the deamination of  xxxd5xxx . l-cysteine was an extremely poor substrate; its deamination took place at a rate
that was only slightly above background nadh oxidation. by
contrast, both  xxxd5xxx  and l-cysteine were reasonable competitive inhibitors, displaying ki values of 1.41 ⫾ 0.19 and 0.90 ⫾
0.09 mm, respectively (fig. 5). l-alanine at concentrations below 25 mm did not inhibit the reaction to any significant extent,
and in fact, produced a slight stimulatory effect (data not
shown).
in contrast to the reconstituted enzyme, as-isolated lsd1
behaved erratically, making it difficult to obtain good kinetic
data on this state of the enzyme. in general, however, its
activity was more than 5-fold lower than that of the reconstituted enzyme. it was absolutely critical that dilutions of the
reconstituted enzyme be made in buffer b containing 50%
glycerol. we discovered that at lower concentrations of glycerol,

assays were carried out as described under “experimental procedures.”
the concentration of lsd1 in each assay was 55 nm. a, l-serine was
varied between 1 and 15 mm at 0 (open triangles), 3 (open circles), 6
(closed circles), 12 (open squares), and 24 (closed squares) mm  xxxd5xxx .
b, l-serine was varied between 2 and 20 mm at 0 (open triangles), 2
(open circles), 5 (closed circles), 10 (open squares), and 20 (closed
squares) mm cysteine. lineweaver-burk plots were constructed by multiple non-linear regression analysis of the data to equation 3 using the
grafit software program.

the enzyme rapidly lost activity (t1⁄2 ⬇ 30 min), even while
sitting on ice in the anaerobic chamber. when 50% glycerol was
not part of the diluent, the kinetic profiles displayed cooperative behavior at low concentrations of substrate, followed by
what appeared to be substrate inhibition. this behavior can be
rationalized by a combination of the instability of the enzyme
and performing the assays in sequence from low substrate to
high substrate. at concentrations of substrate near vmax,
wherein the observed rate does not change significantly as a
function of substrate concentration, what appears to be substrate inhibition is simply activity loss that is due to enzyme
instability.
molecular sieve chromatography of serine deaminase—an
analysis of the quaternary structure of lsd1 was undertaken
by molecular-sieve chromatography on superose 200 under
anaerobic conditions. the primary sequence of the his-tagged
protein indicates a molecular mass of ⬃51 kda, consistent with
its analysis by  xxxg2043xxx -page electrophoresis. a plot of log ve v0⫺1
versus molecular weight for a series of protein standards was
used to generate a standard curve from which the molecular
weight of lsd1 was extracted. peak 1 in the chromatogram
eluted with a retention time that corresponds to a protein of
252 kda and accounts for a minor (⬃5%) fraction of the total
protein (fig. 6). all remaining lsd1 is accounted for in peak 2,
which was highly uniform and symmetrical in shape. peak 2
eluted at a retention time that corresponds to a protein of 107
kda, which is consistent with a dimeric quaternary structure
for the overwhelming majority of lsd1 under the conditions
outlined under “experimental procedures.” note that our
lsd1 contains a carboxyl-terminal 6⫻ histidine tag. whether
the his tag influences dimerization has not been assessed.

an iron-sulfur cluster in serine deaminase

interaction of the [4fe-4s] cluster with substrate and substrate analogs—to determine whether the [4fe-4s] cluster
participates in catalysis or simply acts as a structural element
of the protein, we assessed whether the addition of substrate
would perturb the mössbauer or epr spectra of the samples.
unexpectedly, upon addition of 20 mm l-serine to dithionitereduced lsd1, the intensity of the epr spectrum drastically
decreased in the ⬍30 s that it took to freeze the sample (fig.
7a); the residual spectrum shows a very slight broadening of
the feature at g ⫽ 2.03 (fig. 7a, inset). by contrast, the spectra
in the presence of l-cysteine,  xxxd3361xxx , and  xxxd5xxx  are not
significantly reduced in intensity but also show the slight
broadening in their features at g ⫽ 2.03, which is indicated by
the arrows in fig. 7 (b and c). the spectrum in the presence of
l-cysteine is not displayed, because it is identical to those in the
presence of  xxxd3361xxx  and  xxxd5xxx . the marked change in
spectral intensity upon addition of the true substrate, but not
upon addition of inhibitors or poor substrates, suggests that the
amino acid binds to or near the fe/s cluster and that the
reduction in spectral intensity might be related to turnover.
mössbauer spectroscopy was also used to probe for interactions between the substrate and the fe/s cluster. because
small substrate-induced perturbations in the spectrum of the
fe/s cluster are more easily detected in species giving rise to a
quadrupole doublet rather than a magnetically split spectrum,
the experiment was carried out using reconstituted lsd1 that
was not treated with dithionite and that contained 50 ⫾ 5% of
the iron in the form of [4fe-4s]2⫹ clusters.  xxxd3361xxx  was
employed as the added substrate, because it is turned over
significantly slower than l-serine (see above) but gives rise to
the same perturbation of the epr spectrum of the [4fe-4s]⫹
cluster. the mössbauer spectrum of reconstituted lsd1 (350
␮m) in the presence of 20 mm  xxxd3361xxx  was identical to the
spectrum of reconstituted lsd1 in the absence of substrate (i.e.
the mössbauer spectrum is not perturbed by  xxxd3361xxx ).

fig. 7. x-band epr spectra of reconstituted lsd1 in the presence of l-serine (a),  xxxd3361xxx  (b), and  xxxd5xxx  (c). conditions

frequency, 9.65 ghz. in each case, the dashed line is reconstituted
lsd1 reduced with 2 mm dithionite in the absence of added amino

of  xxxd3361xxx  and  xxxd5xxx  were multiplied by 1.75 to make their
intensities similar to that of the dashed spectrum to better compare the
broadening in the feature at 2.03 (arrows). the spectrum in the presence of l-cysteine is not displayed, because it is identical to those in the
presence of  xxxd5xxx  and  xxxd3361xxx .

discussion

in this study we described the biochemical and biophysical
characterization of e. coli  xxxg2043xxx  containing an
n-terminal 6⫻ his tag. when overexpressed in e. coli, the
isolated protein contained small amounts of iron and sulfide
(1.86 ⫾ 0.46 iron and 0.670 ⫾ 0.019 s2⫺ per monomer) and
displayed a weak uv-visible spectrum in the 300- to 700-nm
region that is consistent with the presence of [4fe-4s] clusters.
anaerobic treatment of the protein with fecl3 and na2s in the
presence of dtt resulted in the uptake of substantial amounts
of iron and sulfide, as well as a dramatic increase in the activity
of the protein. we used a combination of uv-visible, epr, and
mössbauer spectroscopies together with analytical methods to
assess the configuration of all species of iron on the protein
subsequent to reconstitution, as well as their relative stoichiometries. we found that the predominant configuration was
[4fe-4s]2⫹ (1.25 ⫾ 0.25 eq per polypeptide), accounting for
greater than 50% of the total iron associated with the protein.
other fe/s-cluster forms detected included 0.50 ⫾ 0.25 eq of
[2fe-2s]2⫹ and ⬃0.02 eq of [3fe-4s]⫹ clusters per polypeptide.
the large uncertainty in each value reflects the individual
errors of three different methods, which are the determination
of protein and iron concentrations, and the quantification of
various configurations of iron by mössbauer spectroscopy.
we argue, as has been previously proposed (10, 11), that the
catalytically active form contains one [4fe-4s]2⫹ cluster and
that the other cluster species are artifacts of the reconstitution

an iron-sulfur cluster in serine deaminase

procedure.2 indeed, the protein contains 9 cysteine residues,
which can contribute to the coordination of adventitious iron,
especially if any of the cysteines are on the surface of the
protein. the thermodynamic stability of fe/s clusters is well
documented, and [4fe-4s] and most likely [2fe-2s] clusters,
which are coordinated by exogenous thiolate ligands (e.g. dtt)
are present in solution under reconstitution conditions (33).
spectroscopically, such species are not expected to be discernible from genuine fe/s cofactors. potentially, these clusters
may bind to surface-exposed cysteine residues of the protein,
forming clusters of the general formula [4fe-4s]dttncys4⫺n,
which may not be separated from the protein by gel filtration
chromatography.
we demonstrated that the reconstituted enzyme is catalytically active, converting l-serine to pyruvate and ammonia with
a kcat of 436 s⫺1.  xxxd3361xxx  and l-allo-threonine were also
turned over, albeit significantly slower, whereas l-cysteine and
 xxxd5xxx  were found to be competitive inhibitors. in contrast,
the as-isolated enzyme did not yield reliable kinetic data, which
we attribute to its lability and cofactor deficiency. these studies support our contention that the catalytically active state of
lsd1 contains a [4fe-4s] cluster.
our model for the deamination of l-serine by lsd1 is based
on the elegant work of beinert, kennedy, emptage, münck,
and collaborators on the enzyme  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx  (21), which catalyzes the interconversion of citrate and isocitrate. the first step
involves the dehydration of citrate to form cis-aconitate, which
is subsequently rehydrated, affording isocitrate. in its resting
state, the enzyme contains a [4fe-4s]2⫹ cluster that is ligated
to the protein via three cysteine residues that are coordinated
to three of the irons of the cluster, termed feb. the fourth iron,
fea, is not coordinated by a cysteine residue, but contains a
bound hydroxyl (water) group. in addition, the hydroxyl group of
the substrate, as well as one of the substrate carboxylate groups,
2
in accord with this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis studies
indicate that only 3 of the 9 cysteine residues are essential for catalysis,
because their substitution with non-sulfur-containing amino acids results in abolishment of catalytic activity. these cysteines presumably
are those that ligate the [4fe-4s] cluster. similar substitutions of the
remaining cysteine residues either produce relatively slight decreases
or increases in activity (x. zhao, q. sun, y. m. tang, s. j. booker, and
e. newman, submitted for publication).

ligate iron fea in a bidentate fashion, resulting in hexacoordination at this site. the fe/s cluster is thought to facilitate loss of the
hydroxyl group by acting as a lewis acid (21).
a similar role has been proposed for the fe/s cluster of lsd1
(10, 11), and a mechanism for deamination of l-serine is shown
in scheme 2. coordination of the hydroxyl group of l-serine (1)
to the unique iron of the fe/s cluster (2) allows elimination of
the hydroxyl group, presumably with general acid assistance,
and formation of 2-amino-2-propenoic acid. tautomerization of
this species gives rise to 2-iminopropionic acid (3), which is
subsequently hydrolyzed to ammonia and pyruvate.
in  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx , a wealth of spectroscopic evidence supports the
role of the unique iron site in binding substrate and facilitating
loss of the hydroxyl group. upon addition of substrate, the
electronic structure of the [4fe-4s]2⫹ cluster changes significantly, as evidenced by changes of the mössbauer parameters
of site fea, which depend on the nature of the substrate bound:
␦ ⫽ 0.44 mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 0.83 mm/s (no substrate), ␦ ⫽ 0.84
mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 1.26 mm/s (isocitrate), and ␦ ⫽ 0.89 mm/s and
⌬eq ⫽ 1.83 mm/s (citrate) (21, 34 –36). in addition, the epr
spectrum of the [4fe-4s]⫹ cluster changes significantly upon
substrate addition, with the principal g values shifting from
2.06, 1.93, and 1.86, to 2.04, 1.85, and 1.78, respectively (21,
35). the exact mode of binding of substrates to the fe/s cluster
was established by 57fe, 33s, 15n, and 17o electron-nuclear
double-resonance spectroscopy (37– 40) and was subsequently
confirmed by x-ray crystallography (41). other enzymes containing a [4fe-4s] cluster, in which only three iron sites are
coordinated by cysteinate ligands from the protein, include the
enzymes of the radical s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  (sam) superfamily. the cosubstrate or cofactor, sam, coordinates to the
fourth iron site in a bidentate fashion via the amino and carboxylate substituents of the molecule (42, 43), causing significant changes of the epr and mössbauer spectroscopic properties of the cluster. for example, in pyruvate formate-lyase
(pfl) activase, the mössbauer parameters of fea of the [4fe4s]2⫹ cluster change from ␦ ⫽ 0.42 mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 1.12 mm/s
to ␦ ⫽ 0.72 mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 1.15 mm/s upon addition of sam.
binding of sam also perturbs the epr spectrum of the [4fe4s]⫹ cluster of pfl activase; the observed g values shift from
2.01 and 1.94 to 2.01, 1.89, and 1.88 (44, 45). in biotin synthase,
another member of the radical sam superfamily, addition of

thereby confirmed, the hypothesis that catalytically active
lsd1 requires [4fe-4s] clusters for catalysis. the proposed
role of the [4fe-4s] cluster is coordination of the hydroxyl
group of the substrate, thus facilitating its elimination. tests of
this model are currently under investigation. in particular, the
finding that lsd1 can be reduced to the [4fe-4s]⫹ state renders the protein amenable to study by other forms of spectroscopy that can unequivocally establish the exact nature of the
interaction between the substrate and the fe/s cluster.

sam perturbs the mössbauer parameters of two iron sites of
the [4fe-4s]2⫹ cluster. in the absence of sam, both sites have
␦ ⫽ 0.47 mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 1.10 mm/s, which convert to ␦ ⫽ 0.40
mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 0.86 mm/s, and ␦ ⫽ 0.64 mm/s and ⌬eq ⫽ 1.26
mm/s, respectively, in the presence of sam. in analogy to pfl
activase and  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx , the epr spectrum of the [4fe-4s]⫹
cluster of biotin synthase is sensitive to the presence of sam;
the principal g values shift from 2.04 and 1.94 to 2.00, 1.93, and
1.85 (46).
in contrast to the significant changes in the epr and mössbauer spectra of  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx  and the radical sam enzymes upon
binding of substrate, we observe comparatively small changes
in the epr spectra of the [4fe-4s]⫹ cluster in the presence of
l-serine,  xxxd3361xxx , l-allo-threonine, or  xxxd5xxx . the
changes, however, are nearly identical for all of these substrates, suggesting that they interact with the [4fe-4s] cluster
in a similar way. the mössbauer spectrum of lsd1 in the
presence of  xxxd3361xxx  revealed no discernable changes compared with the spectrum of reconstituted lsd1. we point out,
however, that for  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx  and the radical sam enzymes, the
unique iron site has coordination numbers of 6 and 5, respectively, when the substrate is bound. in the absence of substrate, their mössbauer parameters for fea are similar to those
typically observed for cysteinate-ligated iron sites of [4fe-4s]2⫹
clusters. the changes in the mössbauer parameters upon substrate binding are thus likely to be a consequence of the increased coordination number. our combined epr and mössbauer spectroscopic studies suggest that l-serine might
displace the fourth ligand coordinated to fea in lsd1, which is
presumably a water (hydroxide) molecule, and coordinates the
iron in a monodentate fashion (scheme 2). in support of this
hypothesis, it has been proposed that coordination of l-serine to
the fe/s cluster of lsd1 is most likely monodentate, involving
only the hydroxyl group of the substrate, because simultaneous
coordination of the hydroxyl group and either the amino or the
carboxylate group would not permit proper orbital alignment for effective elimination of water (hydroxide) from the
substrate (10).
three related serine deaminases have been described in
some detail. these are the enzymes from peptostreptococcus
asaccharolyticus (10), clostridium propionicum (19), and clostridium sticklandii (47). each of these proteins is activated by
iron and dtt; however, the nature of the iron-containing cofactor has been demonstrated only in the enzyme from p.
asaccharolyticus. upon purification of the enzyme under anaerobic conditions, it displayed a rhombic epr signal (g1 ⫽
2.001, g2 ⫽ 2.014, and g3 ⫽ 2.028) in phosphate buffer at ph 5
and a fairly axial signal around g ⫽ 2.01 in tricine-koh buffer
(ph 8.0). both signals broadened considerably as the temperature was raised, such that they were no longer visible above
30 k. these g values and temperature-dependent properties
were taken to indicate the presence of [3fe-4s]⫹ clusters (20).
interestingly, the addition of high concentrations of l-serine in
each case caused the two signals to converge into signals of
similar shape. the authors concluded that the substrate must
bind in proximity to the cluster, protecting it from buffer solutes, which affect the properties of the epr spectrum of the
protein (20). we emphasize that this form of the fe/s cluster is
believed not to be catalytically relevant and that effects of
substrate on the cluster probably are unrelated to direct interaction, because the missing iron is presumably the one to which
the substrate binds. efforts to observe the catalytically relevant form of the fe/s cluster were unsuccessful; the cluster was
not amenable to reduction to the [4fe-4s]⫹ state by chemical
methods (sodium dithionite) or by photoreduction.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time, and
