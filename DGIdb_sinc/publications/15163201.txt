structure-activity studies were performed on the r1a-adrenoceptor (ar) selective agonist n-[5(1h-imidazol-4-yl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]methanesulfonamide (4). compounds were
evaluated for binding activity at the r1a, r1b, r1d, r2a, and r2b subtypes. functional activity in
tissues containing the r1a (rabbit urethra), r1b (rat spleen), r1d (rat aorta), and r2a (rat prostatic
vas deferens) was also evaluated. a dog in vivo model simultaneously measuring intraurethral
pressure (iup) and mean arterial pressure (map) was used to assess the uroselectivity of the
compounds. many of the compounds that were highly selective in vitro for the r1a-ar subtype
were also more uroselective in vivo for increasing iup over map than the nonselective r1agonists phenylpropanolamine (ppa) (1) and st-1059 (2, the active metabolite of midodrine),
supporting the hypothesis that greater r1a selectivity would reduce cardiovascular side effects.
however, the data also support a prominent role of the r1a-ar subtype in the control of map.

introduction
stress urinary incontinence (sui) is due to the
inability of the urethra to restrict the leakage of urine
during stresses such as coughing or sneezing. in the
human, postsynaptic urethral tone is largely mediated
by activation of r-adrenoceptors (r-ars).2 the nonselective r1-adrenergic agonists 13 and midodrine4 have been
found to be efficacious in clinical studies for the treatment of sui. unfortunately, these agents suffer from
side effects that include increases in blood pressure
(bp).2-5
three subtypes of the r1-ar have been identified (r1a,
r1b, and r1d),6 and there is strong evidence that the r1aar is the primary subtype in the human urethra and
the receptor most likely to be responsible for constriction
of the urethra.7 evidence has pointed toward a prominent role of the r1b-ar in the control of bp. in vitro
radioligand binding selectivity of antagonists selective
for the r1a over the r1b subtype has been shown to
correspond to selectivity in vivo for blockade of agonistinduced increases of intraurethral pressure (iup) versus
arterial pressure.8,9 treatment with tamsulosin, an r1antagonist with affinity for the r1b-ar lower than that
of the r1a and r1d subtypes, is associated with fewer
vascular events, compared to classical nonselective r1ar antagonists.10 in addition, a mouse knockout study
provided evidence for a prominent role of the r1b

subtype in the control of blood pressure.11 the role of
the r1d-ar has not been fully elucidated, but this
subtype has been demonstrated to play a part in the
pressor responses to sympathetic stimulation.12-14 therefore, we were interested in finding r1a selective agonists
with the hope that these agents would constrict the
urethra with fewer hypertensive side effects than seen
with the nonselective r1 agonists.
in searching for novel structures based on the selective r1a-agonist a-61603 (3),15 we discovered imidazole
4.16 an in vivo dog model demonstrated that 4 was more
selective than 1-3 (see chart 1) for increasing iup over
mean arterial pressure (map). sar studies were performed on 4 in which modifications were made to the
sulfonamide, the aromatic ring, the tetralin, and the
imidazole. the results of these studies are presented.
chemistry
the syntheses of the compounds are shown in schemes
1-3. starting with a nitroketone of structure a (see
scheme 1), the imidazole ring was introduced via a
grignard reagent generated in situ from 4-iodo-1-(n,ndimethylsulfamoyl)-1h-imidazole 517 or 4-iodo-1-trityl1h-imidazole 6.18 the intermediate alcohol (not shown)

was dehydrated under acidic conditions with or without
deprotection of the imidazole to provide alkenes b or
d. imidazole b was protected with a boc group to
provide derivative c. hydrogenation of c or d provided
the saturated aniline intermediate of structure e.
formation of the sulfonamide, carbamate, or amide
followed by deprotection provided the desired products.
enantiomeric separation for several examples was accomplished by chiral chromatography of the bocprotected intermediates of structure f.
in certain cases, protected sulfonamidotetralones of
structure i were suitable intermediates for elaboration
to the final compounds (see scheme 2). intermediate i
was available via n-protection of sulfonamides g or by
sulfonation of benzylanilines h. treatment of the
protected ketosulfonamides with the grignard reagent
derived from 5 followed by acidic deprotection provided
the unsaturated imidazoles j. in the cases where the
protecting group (pg′′) was mom or boc, the nh

sulfonamide was obtained after the dehydration step.
reduction of the double bond with concomitant removal
of the bn group when pg′′ ) bn provided the desired
products.
in cases where the benzylic position was unsubstituted (scheme 3), nitroaldehydes of structure k were
treated with the grignard reagent derived from 5. the
resulting intermediate alcohol was reduced by treatment with triethylsilane in the presence of tfa to
provide intermediate l, which was sulfonated and
deprotected as described in scheme 1.
syntheses of individual compounds such as the imidazole modifications in table 5 can be found in the
experimental section.
biological evaluation
compounds were evaluated in radioligand binding
assays. the r1 binding assays (r1a, r1b, and r1d) were
performed (see tables 1-5) essentially as described by
knepper et al.19 the r2a and r2b binding assays (see
table 6) were performed as described.20,21 the binding
selectivities of the compounds for the r1a subtype versus
the other subtypes are shown.
the functional agonism of the test compounds to
constrict tissue containing the r1a (rabbit urethra), r1b
(rat spleen), and r1d (rat aorta) ars was evaluated.22a
efficacy of less than 15% relative to phenylephrine (pe)
was considered inactive. the r1d functional data for the
test compounds were excluded from tables 2-5 because
all of the compounds except for two were inactive in rat

aorta.23 relaxation of field-stimulated rat prostatic vas
deferens was used to measure the r2a functional activity
and referenced against clonidine.22a
in vivo assessment of uroselectivity was performed
in a dog model similar to one used to evaluate r1
antagonists. briefly, map and iup were measured24
simultaneously in isoflurane anesthetized female beagles
using a chronically implanted telemetry transducer/
transmitter and a urethral catheter, respectively. increasing doses of the target agents were administered
via iv injection, and the maximal effect25 of each dose
was determined. the doses corresponding to a 5 mmhg
increase in iup (iup ed∆5)26 and a 20 mmhg increase
in map (map ed∆20)27 were calculated. for the purposes of comparing compounds, the ratios of the map
ed∆20 over the iup ed∆5 (map/iup ratio) for selected
test compounds are shown in table 7.
in vitro studies
in vitro data for the r1-ar agonists 1-3 are displayed
in table 1. compounds 1 and 2 demonstrated no
selectivity for the r1a subtype in binding studies, and
only 2 showed any functional (r1a over r1b) selectivity.
compound 3 was highly selective for the r1a-ar in
binding and functional studies.

compound 4 bound to the r1a subtype with a pki of
6.71 and was 20- and 8-fold selective for the r1a over
r1b and r1d subtypes, respectively (see table 2). in
comparison to the compounds displayed in table 1, 4
was between 3 and 2 in binding potency and selectivity
for the r1a subtype. compound 4 had similar binding
potency for the r1a and the r2 subtypes (see table 6).
many of the compounds in this series bound with high
affinity to the r2 subtypes, and this will be addressed
later in this paper.
in functional studies, 4 contracted the rabbit urethra
(r1a) with a pd2 ) 6.35 and an efficacy of 83% relative
to pe. in contrast to the agents depicted in table 1, 4
was inactive at both rat spleen (r1b) and rat aorta (r1d).
separation of the enantiomers revealed that the (r)(+)-enantiomer 7 possessed the activity and had an in
vitro profile similar to that of the racemate.
small modifications to the sulfonamide of 4 were
allowed. methylation of the sulfonamide nh produced
9, a compound with a binding potency similar to that
of 4 but over twice as selective for the r1a over the r1b
subtype. the (+)-ethylsulfonamide, 10, was more potent
and selective for the r1a subtype than 4 in the binding
assay and functional studies. the improved potency of
10 led us to incorporate the ethyl sulfonamide into many

of the modifications of compound 4. the (+)-trifluoroethyl analogue 11 had a similar binding affinity compared to 4 for the r1a subtype but was less potent in
functional studies.
further increases in the size of the aliphatic group
on the sulfonamide (compounds 12-14) resulted in
decreased potency in binding and functional studies.
aromatic sulfonamides were generated using parallel
synthesis techniques. in summary, aromatic substitutions on the sulfonamide provided compounds that
either had no affinity for the r1a subtype or bound (i.e.,
15) but did not have any functional activity in rabbit
urethra.
replacement of the sulfonamide with other groups
was examined. compared with 4, the sulfonyl urea, 16,
and the  xxxd63xxx , 17, provided slightly reduced potency for the r1a subtype in binding studies. the
trifluoroacetamide 18 was equipotent with 4 for the r1a
subtype in binding and functional studies. the carbamate 19 showed good potency and selectivity in binding
studies. the phenol and aniline, 2028 and 21, bound
effectively with the r1a subtype but were less selective
against the r1b and r1d subtypes.
substitutions were made on the aromatic portion of
the tetralin of 4 (table 3). the 2-hydroxy analogue, 22,
is structurally similar to 3 and has a similar pharmacological profile as a full agonist at the r1b and r1d23
subtypes. the 2-methoxy derivative 23 had reduced
activity and selectivity in binding studies and was
inactive in functional studies. substitution at the 3
position with f or cl provided compounds both potent
and highly selective for the r1a subtype vs r1b. compound 26, with a bulky cyclohexyl group at the 3
position, maintained good affinity for the r1a subtype,
but the selectivity was diminished. substitution at the
4 position resulted in compounds (27-31) with reduced
potency in binding and functional studies.
modifications were made to the aliphatic portion of
the tetralin ring of 4 (table 4). incorporation of a
hydroxyl group r to the imidazole (32) or oxidation of
the ring to the dihydronaphthalene (33) resulted in a

loss of activity. reduction of the ring size from tetralin
to indane, 34, resulted in a compound that was approximately 8-fold more potent and more selective for
the r1a subtype in binding and functional studies.29
increasing the size of the tetralin to the benzocycloheptane 35 resulted in a significant loss of in vitro potency.
the chroman 39 and thiochroman 40 displayed a 2- and
5-fold reduction in potency, respectively, compared to
4. the isobenzofuran 41 was over 40-fold less potent in
binding to the r1a subtype than the indane 34. this
reduction in potency may be a result of hydrogen
bonding between the imidazole and the oxygen of 41. a
similar hydrogen-bonding effect may be the cause for
the reduced potency for compound 28. the regioisomeric
derivative 42 essentially lost all activity for the r1a
subtype but was fairly potent at the r2 subtypes (see
table 6). removal of the aliphatic portion of the tetralin
provided 36 (abt-866), an agent on which we have
previously published.22a,30 compound 36 was found to
possess antagonistic activity for the r1b and r1d subtypes. compound 37 had a r1a binding potency similar
to that of 36 but with improved selectivity. a methyl
group at the benzylic position as in 38 was found to be
deleterious to r1a potency.
several modifications were made to the imidazole and
the benzylic portion of the molecule (see table 5). none
of the modifications examined were favorable. methyl
substitution of the imidazole (43-45) reduced activity.
although 43 displayed binding potency (r1a pki ) 6.56)
similar to that of 4, 43 was very weak in constricting
the rabbit urethra (pd2 ) 5.26). primary and secondary
amines (46, 47, 51, and 54) had moderate affinity for
the r1a subtype (r1a pki ) 6.10, 5.86, 6.15, and 6.30,
respectively) but were found to be inactive in functional
studies. the 2-imidazoline, 48, was slightly weaker in
binding potency at the r1a subtype but had an overall
in vitro profile similar to that of 4 (r1a pki ) 6.34, rabbit
urethra (r1a) pd2 ) 6.19, inactive in rat spleen (r1b)).
the clonidine analogue 50 was very weak in binding
(pki ) 5.35) to the r1a subtype and inactive in rabbit
urethra. removal (compound 49) or replacement of the

methylene with a sulfur or sulfoxide group (compounds
52 and 53) led to inactive compounds. partial reduction
of the imidazole (compound 55) also resulted in complete
loss of activity.
in vivo studies
many of the compounds were evaluated in vivo, and
the results are shown in table 7. the in vitro nonselective r1 agonist 1 was found to have a map/iup ratio of
0.4 in vivo. compounds 2 and 3, both selective for the
r1a over the r1b subtype in functional studies, had
improved in vivo profiles relative to 1.
compound 4, an r1a-agonist devoid of activity at
functional r1b and r1d subtypes, was approximately

100-fold less potent in vivo but more uroselective than
3 with an map/iup ratio of 4.8. the active enantiomer
7 had an in vivo profile similar to that of the racemate.
small modifications to the sulfonamide of 4 were
allowed in vivo. although the n-methylated sulfonamide
9 had in vitro functional potency and selectivity similar
to those of 4, its in vivo potency was reduced by over
3-fold and the in vivo selectivity was reduced. as
expected from their relative r1a functional potencies in
rabbit urethra, the (+)-ethylsulfonamide 10 was 2-fold
more potent than 7 in vivo for constricting the urethra,
and the (+)-trifluoroethyl analogue 11 was less potent.
no improvement with in vivo uroselectivity over 7 was
found with these analogues.

replacement of the sulfonamide with an acetate group
(compounds 17 and 18) led to lower in vivo potency and
selectivity relative to 4. removal of the sulfonamide, as
in 21, provided an agent with in vivo potency similar
to that of 4 but with reduced uroselectivity. substitutions to the aromatic ring of 4 had no advantage in vivo
(22, 25, 28, and 30). the highly potent 2-hydroxy
analogue 22 was very similar to 3 in its overall
pharmacological profile.
modifications to the tetralin ring of 4 were also
examined in vivo. the chroman 39 had in vitro potency
similar to that of 4 but was less potent in vivo. indane
34 was 6-fold more potent than 4 at increasing iup but
had a similar potency for increasing map. compound
36 was found to possess antagonistic activity for the r1b
and r1d subtypes and had an improved map/iup ratio

relative to 4 of 6.5.30 in vivo analysis revealed that 37
lost 3-fold potency for increasing iup compared to 36
but had similar uroselectivity.
although incorporation of a methyl group at the
benzylic position of 36 reduced in vitro and in vivo
potency, compound 38 had a map/iup ratio similar to
that of compound 4.
the n-methylated imidazole 43 was inactive in vivo.
the imidazoline 48, similar to 4 in its in vitro profile,
was nonselective in vivo.
discussion
our original hypothesis was that compounds selective
for the r1a subtype would have reduced cardiovascular
effects over nonselective r1 agonists. indeed, a number
of compounds such as 4, 10, 36, and 37 have improved
map/iup ratios compared with 1 and 2. surprisingly,
these highly selective r1a agents still possessed significant ability for increasing map. in addition, many of
the highly in vitro selective agents such as 34 and 48
were nonselective in vivo. recent evidence indicates that
the r1a subtype is important in the vasoconstriction of
human31 and other species.32 although the r1b and r1d
subtypes may play a role in the control of map,11-14 the
compounds of this series are generally inactive in
functional studies for these subtypes. the r2a21b,33 and
r2b34 subtypes have also been implicated in the control
of bp. the r2b-ar subtype in particular has been shown
to be responsible for the transient hypertensive effects
of iv administered r2 agonists. the compounds in this
series do have affinity for the r2a and r2b subtypes and
many have functional activity in the rat prostatic vas
deferens (r2a) and this r2 activity could play a role in
their map effects.
correlation plots were generated in order to compare
the r1 and r2 in vitro activity of the compounds in this
series with in vivo increases in iup and map (see
tables 8 and 9).35 a moderate correlation existed for the
binding affinity for the r1a subtype vs map ed∆20 (r2
) 0.46) and vs iup ed∆5 (r2 ) 0.62). similar correlations
were seen for r2a binding vs map ed∆20 (r2 ) 0.63) and

vs iup ed∆5 (r2 ) 0.56). however, the potency for
relaxation of the rat prostatic vas deferens (r2a) had no
correlation vs map (r2 ) 0.002) or iup (r2 ) 0.03). there
was also no correlation seen between r1b or r1d binding
and map or iup.
the best correlations were observed for functional r1a
activity (constriction of rabbit urethra) vs map (r2 )
0.70) and iup (r2 ) 0.82). as can be seen from figure
1, compound 1 appears to be an outlier, being more
potent in vivo than in vitro relative to the other
compounds. recalculation of the plots in the absence of
1 improves both of these correlations (r2 for rabbit
urethra vs map and vs iup ) 0.85 and 0.85, respectively). these correlations provide evidence that both
the map and iup effects of the compounds in this series
are due to stimulation of the r1a-ar.
the lack of correlation between the rat prostatic vas
deferens vs map and iup in the dog may be due to the
species differences. in addition, no correlation (r2 )
0.002) was observed between the r2a binding (human
clone) and the rat prostatic vas deferens (graph not
shown). the r2a subtype found in humans, dogs, and
rabbits is a species orthologue of the r2a subtype found
in rat, known as the r2d-ar.36 differences in affinities
of antagonists for these two receptors have been reported.37 therefore, the r2a binding data (human clone)
may be more predictive of the r2a activity in dogs than
the rat prostaic vas deferens. interestingly, reevaluation
of the rat prostatic vas deferens using only compounds
that were fully efficacious (100%) revealed an improved
correlation with the r2a binding data (r2 ) 0.53, slope
) 0.77) as well as with the map (r2 ) 0.57) and iup (r2
) 0.26).

figure 2. pressor effects of 36 in the presence of  xxxd3000xxx 
and idazoxan.

to more directly ascertain the potential influence of
r2 activity of this series on map, the pressor effects of
an iv administered 100 nmol/kg dose of 36 were measured in a conscious dog model in the presence of 0.3
mg/kg of the r1 antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  or 1 mg/kg of the
r2 antagonist idazoxan (see figure 2).  xxxd3000xxx  significantly attenuated the vasoconstrictive effects of 36
whereas idazoxan did not, thus providing further evidence for the prominent role of the r1a subtype in the
control of map.
in summary, the sar of a series of imidazoles based
on the r1a selective agonist 4 was described. small
modifications to the sulfonamide portion of the molecule
were allowed, and the ethyl sulfonamide 10 was found
to be more potent in vivo. modifications to the aromatic
portion of the molecule were allowed, and some increases in potency were noted. removal of the carbocylic
ring allowed for the discovery of compound 36, an r1a
selective agonist with antagonism at the r1b and r1d
subtypes.
in vivo analysis demonstrated that many of the
compounds were more uroselective than the nonselective r1-agonists 1 and 2, supporting the hypothesis that
greater r1a selectivity would reduce cardiovascular side
effects. surprisingly, some of the highly in vitro selective
r1a-agonists such as 34 and 48 were nonselective in
vivo. although we cannot completely rule out the
influence of other factors that may contribute to cardiovascular (cv) effects such as peripheral postsynaptic
r2-ars, this data set supports an important role of the
r1a-ar in the control of r1-agonist mediated increases
in map. our results suggest that absolute uroselectivity
may not be achievable with agents that act solely via
the r1a mechanism. however, a partial r1a-agonist has
recently been reported to have efficacy in the treatment
of sui with minimal cv effects.38

model, the baseline pressure measurement is of the catheter
balloon pressure and was measured at approximately 400
mmhg. this is not physiologic but due to the elastic forces in
the inflated balloon. the iup measurement was recorded as the
net change in pressure above this baseline pressure. from
profilometry experiments (data not shown), the measured
urethral pressure (the pucp or proximal urethral closure
pressure) that corresponds to the location of the balloon catheter
in the in vivo dog model was 4-5 mmhg. therefore, a 5 mmhg
increase in iup is approximately a 100% increase over physiological baseline urethral pressure.
the 20 mmhg increase in map was chosen as a consistently
measurable response above the noise of the assay. the average
baseline map values in the anesthetized dogs were about 80
mmhg. therefore, a 20 mmhg increase in map represents
approximately a 25% increase over baseline.
