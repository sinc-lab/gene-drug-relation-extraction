introduction  xxxg87xxx -adrenergic receptor ( xxxg87xxx -ar) stimulation produces smooth muscle contraction, vasoconstriction, and
myocyte hypertrophy, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for  xxxg87xxx -ar antagonists to reduce cardiac workload and
myocardial hypertrophy. preliminary reports suggest that vascular  xxxg87xxx -ars are desensitized in heart failure (hf) in a manner
similar to myocardial  xxxg836xxx -ars. we examined  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction by repeat phenylephrine (pe) infusions in patients with
hf receiving chronic carvedilol therapy.
methods twelve subjects with hf not currently receiving beta-blockers were up-titrated to maximum tolerable doses of
carvedilol. subjects underwent  xxxg87xxx -ar stimulation testing at study baseline, 2 weeks after each dose titration, and 6 months after
maintenance of maximum carvedilol dose. phenylephrine infusions began at 0.5 mug kg−1 min−1, with dose titrations every
10 minutes, to a maximum of 5 mug kg−1 min−1. phenylephrine dose response was evaluated by the pe rate required to elicit a
20 mm hg increase in systolic blood pressure (bp), designated ps20.
results all doses of carvedilol significantly reduced preinfusion measures of heart rate, systolic bp, diastolic bp, and mean
arterial pressure. however, carvedilol also produced a paradoxical trend toward ps20 reduction (indicating increased pe
response) that reached significance at the completion of carvedilol dose titration (ps20 ratio vs baseline = 0.78; p b .001). all
effects were maintained over a 6-month treatment period with no evidence of tolerance.
conclusions

increasing bp response to pe infusion suggests improvement in vascular  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction with
chronic carvedilol therapy. this effect is evident despite no detectable tolerance to preinfusion bp reductions. the varying
affinities of  xxxg87xxx -ar subtypes for carvedilol and pe may have contributed to this finding. (am heart j 2008;156:315-21.)

adrenergic blockade is a cornerstone of therapy for
patients with heart failure (hf). multiple landmark
clinical trials demonstrate the benefit of beta-adrenergic
receptor (ar) antagonism on hf morbidity and mortality.1-3 the impact of alpha-ar antagonism on hf outcomes is
less well understood.  xxxg87xxx -ar stimulation produces smooth
muscle contraction, vasoconstriction, and myocyte
hypertrophy,4-6 suggesting a potential therapeutic role for

 xxxg87xxx -ar antagonists to reduce cardiac workload and
myocardial hypertrophy. however, previous studies
report rapid tolerance to the hemodynamic effects of
 xxxg87xxx -ar antagonists in patients with hf.7
carvedilol is a nonselective third-generation beta-ar
antagonist with additional antagonist activity at the  xxxg87xxx -ar.
data from comet (carvedilol or metoprolol european
trial) support carvedilol as superior to metoprolol tartrate
(a selective  xxxg836xxx -ar antagonist without  xxxg87xxx -ar antagonist
activity) in blood pressure (bp) reduction and hf
mortality.3 these carvedilol benefits appeared within
months of therapy initiation and persisted throughout a
mean follow-up of 4.8 years with no evidence of
tolerance. such findings highlight the need for careful
study of  xxxg87xxx -ar signaling in patients with hf during
chronic carvedilol therapy.
we therefore examined vascular  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction through measurement of bp responses to repeat
phenylephrine (pe) infusions in class c subjects with hf
receiving chronic carvedilol therapy.`

design
this 2-year, prospective, controlled trial was conducted at
the university of utah health sciences center under the
approval of the institutional review board for human
subjects. subjects were eligible for enrollment if they
presented with symptomatic hf (new york heart association
[nyha] functional class ii-iii), with left ventricular ejection
fraction ≤0.40, were aged between 18 and 85 years, and
were willing to provide written informed consent. subjects
were excluded from participation if any of the following
criteria were met: pregnant or lactating women; secondary
hf etiologies (active myocarditis, congenital heart disease,
uncorrected, hemodynamically significant stenotic valvular
disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); asthma or other
obstructive airway diseases requiring bronchodilators; heart
rate (hr) b60 beat/min; supine systolic bp (sbp) b85 mm
hg; supine diastolic bp (dbp) n90 mm hg; uncontrolled
hypertension (sbp n140 mm hg, dbp n90 mm hg); sick
sinus syndrome; mobitz type 2 second-degree atrioventricular
block or third-degree atrioventricular block unless controlled
with an artificial implantable pacemaker; nyha functional
class iv symptoms; myocardial infarction or coronary artery
intervention within 3 months; acute coronary syndromes;
uncorrected endocrine disorders including primary aldosteronism, pheochromcytoma, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism,
type 1 diabetes mellitus; evidence of significant renal disease
(serum creatinine n2.5 mg/dl) or hepatic disease (transaminase level n3-fold higher than laboratory normal); symptomatic peripheral vascular disease; presence of any
progressive systemic disease that would be expected to
impact the patient's outcome over the time course of the
study; or inability or unwillingness to cooperate with study
or to give written informed consent.

procedure
subjects meeting the entrance criteria of the study were
admitted to the university of utah health sciences center
general clinical research center (gcrc) at study entry and
2 weeks after each carvedilol dose titration. during each
gcrc admission, subjects received pe infusions (described
below) to test  xxxg87xxx -ar blockade and signal transduction. after
the end of the carvedilol dose titration, subjects were seen
for outpatient visits in the gcrc once a month for 5 months
to ensure medication compliance. subjects returned to the
gcrc 6 months after the end of carvedilol titration for the
final pe infusion. informed consent was obtained from all
subjects before study participation. study recruitment and
procedures were approved by the university of utah
institutional review board.
phenylephrine infusion. subjects were admitted the
evening before pe infusion to ensure no oral intake (including
tobacco products) for 8 hours before infusion. the morning of
day 2, an 18-gauge peripheral line was placed for (intravenous)
access, and an oral carvedilol dose (when on the second and
subsequent visit) was administered 2 to 4 hours before the start
of the infusion. subjects were placed supine in a quiet room for
30 minutes before establishment of baseline parameters. supine
bp was measured using an automated bp cuff on the right arm
with 2 consecutive readings averaged together. heart rate was

calculated from lead ii of 3-lead telemetry connected to the
subject (5 consecutive r-r intervals on 3-lead telemetry).
once sufficiently rested, patients received pe hydrochloride
(0.9% nacl) 0.5 mug kg−1 min−1 via peripheral intravenous line.8
the pe infusion was titrated every 10 minutes to infusion rates of
1.0, 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 mug kg−1 min−1 until the sbp increased by
30 mm hg from the baseline sbp at visit 1, the dbp exceeded
110 mm hg, or the subject could not tolerate the infusion.8-10
upon completion of each pe infusion, subjects remained under
gcrc care for 1 hour after termination of pe infusion or until bp
returned to pretreatment baseline levels to ensure patient safety.
subjects were discharged with their next titration carvedilol
dose, to be taken twice daily for 2 weeks before the next pe
infusion or until 6 months of dosing was completed. carvedilol
was initiated at 3.125 mg twice daily, with doses titrated to
25 mg twice daily or 50 mg twice daily (for patients n85 kg).

statistical analysis
individual dose-response curves for pe infusions were
constructed using a nonlinear quadratic fit (microsoft excel
2003 sp3). each quadratic fit was used to calculate the dose of pe
required to increase sbp by 20 mm hg (ps20). dose ratios were
calculated at each dose and normalized to precarvedilol values.
all statistical analyses were preformed using stata 9.3 (college
station, tx). blood pressure, hr, and ps20 ratios were compared
with baseline by way of student t test, with 2-sided significance
values set at p b .05. no multiplicity adjustments were used
because each point in time (or carvedilol dose) constituted an
individual test hypothesis.11,12

results
fifteen subjects were enrolled in the study, 12 of
which completed all visits (see table 1 for patient

demographics). there were 2 patients who were
dropped from the study due to inability to attend
scheduled visits, and 1 patient was incarcerated in federal
prison after up-titration of carvedilol. all 12 subjects who
completed the study were able to tolerate at least 12.5 mg
twice daily (average dose = 32 ± 15 mg). on average, our
patients represent a middle-aged (50-60 years old) white
population with class c hf symptoms (nyha fc ii-iii)
and left ventricular (lv) dysfunction (ejection fraction =
23% ± 6%).

preinfusion hemodynamics
all doses of carvedilol produced statistically significant
reductions in preinfusion values for hr, sbp, dbp, and
mean arterial pressure (map) compared with preinfusion
values (see figures 1 and 2).

effects of maximum tolerated carvedilol dose on heart rate
(immediately prior to phenylephrine infusion).

when analyzed by maximum tolerated carvedilol
dose, subjects also experienced significant end-of-titration reductions in preinfusion values for hr
(−14.8 beat/min; p b .01), sbp (−10.0 mm hg; p b .001),
dbp (−3.9 mm hg; p b .05), and map (−6.0 mm hg;
p b .01). there was no difference in any of these values
from end of titration to the 6-month follow-up visit,
suggesting no tolerance to the hr and bp effects of
carvedilol (see figures 3 and 4).

response to pe infusion
despite the well-described  xxxg87xxx -ar antagonistic effects of
carvedilol, subjects demonstrated a trend toward
increasing responsiveness to pe infusions (as demonstrated by reduced ps20 ratios) with increasing carvedilol
doses (see figures 5 and 6).

this effect achieved statistical significance at carvedilol
doses of 25 to 50 mg twice daily. when analyzed by
maximum tolerated carvedilol dose, subjects experienced significantly increased responsiveness to pe
infusions (reduced ps20 ratios) at the end of titration (ps20
ratio = 0.78; p = .01), which remained at the 6-month
follow-up visit (ps20 ratio = 0.62; p b .001) (see figure 7).
no significant arrhythmias were observed during the
course of the study.

discussion
to our knowledge, ours is the first study to systematically characterize  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction during
chronic therapy in patients with hf. as expected, all
subjects exhibited a significant reduction in preinfusion

hr with any dose of carvedilol. this effect served as a
positive control for this protocol, due to the welldescribed carvedilol effects at the myocardial  xxxg836xxx -ar,3,13
and showed no tolerance or deterioration with time
(6 months).
carvedilol also produced significant reductions in
preinfusion bp (sbp, dbp, and map) that were sustained
over a 6-month follow-up period. although this effect
may be attributed to actions at both the  xxxg87xxx -ar and  xxxg836xxx -ar,
the significance of carvedilol  xxxg87xxx -ar blockade on bp was
highlighted in the comet trial, in which carvedilol
produced superior bp reductions versus metoprolol
despite similar reductions in hr.3,14 our study did not
enroll patients with diabetes, limiting potential applications in this patient population. after initial documentation of reduced lv ejection fraction (obtained from
patient medical record), no follow-up echocardiography
was preformed.
published data show conflicting results regarding
the development of tolerance to carvedilol  xxxg87xxx -ar
blocking effects.15,16 however, with chronic carvedilol
therapy, this orthostatic hypotension disappears, suggesting that tolerance may develop to the  xxxg87xxx -ar
blockade. krum et al 17 found that in patients with
severe hf given carvedilol for 14 weeks, systemic
vascular resistance (svr) was significantly reduced
compared with placebo. similarly, metra et al 18 found
that although there was no significant difference in
svr with short-term administration of carvedilol as
compared with placebo, after 16 weeks of continuous
carvedilol therapy, svr was significantly lower in the
carvedilol group than in the placebo group. in
contrast to these findings, our group failed to
demonstrate a reduction in svr with chronic carvedilol therapy in previous studies.19,20

giannattasio et al21 treated 8 patients with mild
essential hypertension with carvedilol. the investigators
infused each subject with pe and measured bp and hr
responses after a single dose of carvedilol and 3 weeks
of continuous therapy of carvedilol. the authors
reported no significant differences in the hr or bp
response to pe between single-dose therapy and shortterm (3 weeks) treatment.
kubo et al22 randomized 36 patients with congestive
heart failure to either carvedilol or metoprolol and
measured the  xxxg87xxx -ar mediated calf vasoconstrictor
response to isometric handgrip exercise. after 16 weeks
of continuous beta-blocker therapy, treatment with carvedilol or metoprolol did not affect the calf vasoconstrictor
response to handgrip exercise. the results of this study
are difficult to interpret because baroreceptor function is
altered in hf and responses to handgrip exercises may
involve multiple mechanisms beyond  xxxg87xxx -ar activation.23
packer et al7 followed cardiovascular hemodynamics
in of 27 subjects with hf receiving  xxxd3000xxx  (pure  xxxg87xxx -ar
antagonist) over a 3- to 12-week follow-up period. initial
 xxxd3000xxx  treatment produced a significant increase in
cardiac index, accompanied by significant reductions in
map, left ventricular filling pressure, and svr. after
completion of the follow-up period, complete tolerance
had developed to the increase in cardiac index,
whereas map, left ventricular filling pressure, and svr
remained significantly reduced (returned to baseline
following discontinuation). of interest, packer et al
hypothesized that the tolerance to “alpha-adrenergic
responsiveness in vascular tissue may be regulated in
both animals and humans at a postreceptor site,
which may undergo significant modification during
sustained alpha-blockade.”7
the most unexpected finding of our current study was
the increasing bp response to pe infusion during
carvedilol treatment. we noted increased  xxxg87xxx -ar agonist
activity in the presence of a known  xxxg87xxx -ar antagonist
(carvedilol). this increased bp response was evident
despite sustained reductions in preinfusion bp, suggesting a previously undescribed pharmacologic consequence of carvedilol in subjects with hf: the potential
up-regulation of impaired vascular  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction in human hf.
goldsmith et al24 first reported evidence for desensitization of vascular  xxxg87xxx -ars in subjects with hf. in this
study, supraphysiologic doses of norepinephrine failed
to elicit a bp or hr response, suggesting some defect or
impairment of the  xxxg87xxx -ar signaling pathway in patients
with hf. other evidence of impaired  xxxg87xxx -ar signal
transduction may be clinically manifest in hf patients
with orthostatic hypotension. in healthy patients,
postural changes in bp are mitigated by baroreceptor
activation of the sympathetic nervous system leading to
increased hr and peripheral vasoconstriction. impaired
(down-regulated)  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction in hf may

van tassell et al 319

limit the peripheral vasoconstriction response necessary to maintain bp requisite for cerebral perfusion, thus
leading to symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. additional symptoms of orthostatic hypotension may be
precipitated by initiation of pharmacologic agents, such
as carvedilol, that block the  xxxg87xxx -ar. however, patients
frequently develop tolerance to orthostasis within
weeks of treatment initiation, suggesting some level of
improved  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction to relay the
sympathetic impulse for peripheral vasoconstriction. it
should be noted that patients frequently develop
tolerance to orthostatic hypotension without attenuation of antihypertensive effects,25,26 suggesting that
improved  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction may develop
independently of resting bp. our current report, in
which carvedilol elicited increasing bp responses to pe
despite sustained reductions in preinfusion bp, supports
these clinical observations.
evidence of altered vascular  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction
mirrors that of the myocardial  xxxg836xxx -ar, which undergoes
down-regulation, uncoupling, and desensitization in hf
after long-standing elevations in sympathetic tone.27,28
use of a  xxxg836xxx -ar antagonist in hf interrupts the
sympathetic overstimulation and allows for gradual
restoration of  xxxg836xxx -ars to their previous functional state,
effectively restoring myocardial  xxxg836xxx -ar signal transduction.29-33 for example, heilbrunn et al33 reported
increased ventricular response to dobutamine (peak
positive left ventricular dp/dt) after chronic treatment (6
months) with metoprolol in patients with hf. this
increased  xxxg836xxx -ar responsiveness occurred in conjunction with increased  xxxg836xxx -ar density despite a significant
reduction in resting hr. our data suggest that a similar
“restorative” biologic process occurs at the vascular alpha1ar with chronic (6 months) carvedilol treatment. it is
worth noting that desensitization of  xxxg87xxx -ar and  xxxg836xxx -ar
may share a common etiology, as patients carrying the
largest risks of orthostasis are typically those exposed to
high levels of sympathetic signaling, whether chronologically (elderly) or pathologically (hf).34-36
the apparent inability of carvedilol to blunt pe agonist
activity may also be attributable to recently described
 xxxg87xxx -ar subtypes, alpha1a-ar, alpha1b-ar, and alpha1d-ar, of which the
effects of alpha1a-ar typically predominate under normal
physiologic conditions. koshimizu et al37 reported higher
carvedilol affinity for alpha1b-ar and alpha1d-ar subtypes versus
the alpha1a-ar subtype in human embryonic kidney cells. in
these cells, carvedilol induced significant reductions in
oscillatory intracellular calcium signaling at both the
alpha1b-ar and alpha1d-ar but not at the alpha1a-ar (p b .01). these
 xxxg87xxx -ar subtypes also undergo differential regulation in
laboratory models. yang et al38 reported down-regulation
of alpha1a-ar and alpha1b-ar in animal models after a 24-hour pe
exposure, whereas the same conditions produced upregulation of alpha1d-ar in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. lei et al39 followed a similar

american heart journal
august 2008

320 van tassell et al

procedure in human embryonic kidney cells, reporting
down-regulation of alpha1a-ar and alpha1d-ar after a 24-hour
exposure to norepinephrine, accompanied by up-regulation of alpha1b-ar. currently, we are aware of no studies
reporting the relative prevalence of  xxxg87xxx -ar subtypes in
human hf. however, the combined work of yang et al
and lei et al suggest that long-standing elevations in
sympathetic tone may produce an altered population of
 xxxg87xxx -ar subtypes in patients with hf, which may yield the
responses to carvedilol observed in our study. the clinical
impact of differential  xxxg87xxx -ar subtype regulation in hf may
depend on future development of  xxxg87xxx -ar antagonists with
subtype selectivity.

conclusions
increasing bp response to  xxxg87xxx -ar stimulation in the
presence of a known  xxxg87xxx -ar antagonist is highly suggestive of improved in  xxxg87xxx -ar signal transduction. this effect
was observed in subjects with hf (class c) with left
ventricular ejection fraction b0.40 during up-titration
with carvedilol and maintained over a 6-month follow-up
period. differential regulation and carvedilol selectivity
for  xxxg87xxx -ar subtypes may have contributed to this finding.
the clinical implication of improved  xxxg87xxx -ar signaling
remains undetermined but may correlate with a resolution of orthostatic hypotension. despite the apparent upregulation of  xxxg87xxx -ar signaling, we observed no tolerance
to the antihypertensive effects of carvedilol on resting
(preinfusion) bp.
we sincerely appreciate the contributions of narneice
craven (study coordinator) for her tireless efforts, dr.
feras bader, md, for his clinical expertise, and the
general clinical research center management staff for
their outstanding patient care.
