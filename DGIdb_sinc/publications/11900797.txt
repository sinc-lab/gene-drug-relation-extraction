abstract
in the present study, the contribution of pertussis toxin (ptx)-sensitive gi/o-proteins to opioid tolerance and m-opioid receptor downregulation in the mouse were examined. mice were injected once intracerebroventricularly and intrathecally with ptx (0.1 mg/site). controls
were treated with saline. on the 10th day following ptx treatment, continuous subcutaneous infusion of  xxxd2070xxx  (150 or 200 mg/kg/day) or
morphine (40 mg/kg/day + 25 mg slow-release pellet) was begun. control mice were implanted with inert placebo pellets. pumps and pellets
were removed 3 days later, and mice were tested for morphine analgesia or m-opioid receptor density was determined in the whole brain, spinal
cord, and midbrain. both infusion doses of  xxxd2070xxx  produced significant tolerance (ed50 shift =  4 – 6-fold) and down-regulation of
m-opioid receptors (  20 – 35%). morphine treatment also produced significant tolerance (ed50 shift =  5 – 8-fold), but no m-opioid receptor
down-regulation. ptx dramatically reduced the acute potency of morphine and blocked the further development of tolerance by both
 xxxd2070xxx  and morphine treatments. however, ptx had no effect on  xxxd2070xxx -induced m-opioid receptor down-regulation in brain, cord, or
midbrain. these results suggest that ptx-sensitive g-proteins have a minimal role in agonist-induced m-opioid receptor density regulation in
vivo, but are critical in mediating acute and chronic functional effects of opioids such as analgesia and tolerance. d 2002 elsevier science inc.

1. introduction
activation of guanine – nucleotide binding proteins
(g-proteins) is the first step in the cascade of receptormediated effects of g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcr),
including the opioid receptors (e.g., sanchez-blazquez
et al., 1995; rossi et al., 1995; raffa et al., 1994). numerous
studies indicate that opioid receptors are coupled to pertussis
toxin (ptx)-sensitive gi/o-proteins (shah et al., 1997; goode
and raffa, 1997; hoehn et al., 1988). ptx catalyzes the adp
ribosylation of a cysteine side chain on the a-subunit of
gi/o-proteins ( xxxd3100xxx , 1990) and inactivates it. antisense
targeting studies confirm the importance of g-proteins in
opioid receptor signaling and have shown that gia-subunits
play a dominant role in opioid coupling to intracellular events
(standifer et al., 1996). however, the role that g-proteins

play in chronic opioid effects such as the regulation of opioid
receptor density and tolerance is less understood.
down-regulation of opioid receptors is readily observed
following chronic exposure to high-intrinsic-efficacy opioid
agonists (e.g.,  xxxd2070xxx ), but not following low-intrinsicefficacy agonists (e.g., morphine) (shen et al., 2000; zaki
et al., 2000; whistler et al., 1999; yabaluri and medzihradsky, 1997; duttaroy and yoburn, 1995). while, it is clear
that down-regulation is not required for opioid tolerance
(whistler et al., 1999; duttaroy and yoburn, 1995), evidence suggests that it contributes to the magnitude of opioid
tolerance (shen et al., 2000; stafford et al., 2001). as such,
it is important to understand the events that mediate opioid
receptor down-regulation and its contribution to chronic
opioid effects such as tolerance.
several investigators have examined the role that ptxsensitive g-proteins play in opioid receptor internalization
and down-regulation in cell culture. in some cases, agonistinduced receptor regulation is independent of g-protein
function (law et al., 1985; kato et al., 1998; remmers

et al., 1998); while other reports indicate that receptor
regulation may be partially blocked by ptx (zaki et al.,
2000; yabaluri and medzihradsky, 1997; chakrabarti et al.,
1997) and that sensitivity differs for m- and d-opioid receptors
(e.g., chakrabarti et al., 1997). these cell culture results make
it difficult to predict if ptx-sensitive g-proteins are critical in
opioid receptor regulation in the intact animal. on the other
hand, the functional effects of opioid agonists in cell culture
and in vivo (e.g., inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, analgesia)
are uniformly inhibited by interference with g-protein function (e.g., remmers et al., 1998; shen et al., 1998).
in the present study, we investigated the role of ptxsensitive g-proteins in opioid effects in the intact animal.
agonist-induced changes in m-opioid receptor density,
opioid agonist potency, and tolerance following ptx treatment were examined. we show that g-protein function does
not impact on m-opioid receptor down-regulation, but plays
a significant role in opioid tolerance.

2. material and methods

2.3. analgesia assay and dose –response testing
analgesia (antinociception) was determined using the
tail-flick assay in which a beam of light was focused on
the dorsal tail surface approximately 2 cm from the tip of the
tail (shen et al., 1998; d’amour and smith, 1941). the
intensity of the light was adjusted so that baseline flick
latencies were 2 – 4 s. if a mouse failed to flick its tail by 10 s
following morphine, the test was terminated and the mouse
was defined as analgesic. mice were tested for analgesia
30 min following morphine administration. all testing was
conducted in a blind manner.
a cumulative dose– response protocol was used for all
studies. all the mice in a treatment group (seven per group)
were injected subcutaneously with a starting dose (0.5 mg/kg)
of morphine and tested for antinociception 30 min later. all
mice that were not analgesic were given a second dose of
morphine (range of doses = 0.5– 45.5 mg/kg) within 5 min of
testing and tested for antinociception again 30 min later. this
cumulative dose –response procedure was continued until all
mice were analgesic. the morphine doses used were determined in a previous study (duttaroy et al., 1997).

2.1. subjects
2.4. m-opioid receptor binding studies
male swiss – webster mice (35 – 40 g; taconic farms,
germantown, ny) were used throughout. mice were housed
10 per cage for at least 24 h prior to experimentation with
free access to food and water. mice were used once.
2.2. procedure
mice were lightly anesthetized with halothane:oxygen
(4:96%) and injected intracerebroventricularly (4 ml) in the
right lateral ventricle (  2 mm caudal and  2 mm lateral
to bregma at a depth of 3 mm) and intrathecally (2 ml) as
described previously (yoburn et al., 1988). mice treated
with ptx were injected once intracerebroventricularly and
intrathecally with ptx (0.1 mg/site). all controls were
treated with saline. on the 10th day following ptx treatment, mice were implanted subcutaneously with osmotic
minipumps that infused  xxxd2070xxx  (150 or 200 mg/kg/day).
other mice were implanted subcutaneously with osmotic
minipumps infusing morphine (40 mg/kg/day) and a slowrelease morphine pellet (25 mg morphine, 122 mg cellulose,
2.5 mg silicon dioxide, and 1.5 mg magnesium stearate).
controls were implanted with a single inert placebo pellet.
the pumps and pellets were removed 72 h following the
start of morphine,  xxxd2070xxx , or placebo treatment. sixteen
hours after termination of  xxxd2070xxx  infusion and 4 h after
the end of morphine treatment, mice were tested for morphine antinociception or mice were sacrificed and brain and
spinal cord removed for m-opioid receptor binding studies
(see below). the interval between the termination of dosing
and collection of tissue is included to allow agonist to be
eliminated and to eliminate possible contamination of binding results by residual drug (see yoburn et al., 1993).

whole brain and spinal cord were rapidly removed,
weighed, and homogenized in 80 vol. of ice-cold 50 mm
 xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.4). in some cases, midbrain was isolated
before homogenization. homogenates were centrifuged at
15,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant discarded, and the
pellet resuspended in buffer and centrifuged again. the
pellet was resuspended and incubated (30 min at 25 c),
centrifuged a third time, and finally resuspended in 20–
80 vol. of phosphate buffer (50 mm, ph 7.2). an aliquot
(200 ml) of the whole brain or spinal cord homogenate was
assayed in triplicate in tubes containing 0.04 – 5.0 nm [3h]damgo. for midbrain samples, an aliquot of homogenate
was assayed in triplicate using a single saturating concentration (5 nm) of [3h]-damgo. nonspecific binding was
determined in the presence of 1000 nm levorphanol. tubes
were incubated for 90 min at 25 c. incubation was
terminated by ice-cold phosphate buffer followed by filtration over gf/b glass fiber filters. filters were transferred to
vials, the scintillation cocktail was added, and vials were
counted. counts per minute (cpm) were converted to
disintegrations per minute (dpm) using the external standard method. protein was determined using the bradford
method (1976) with reagents purchased from bio-rad
(richmond, ca).
2.5. drugs and reagents
 xxxd2070xxx  hcl, morphine pellets, and inert placebo
pellets were obtained from the research triangle institute
(research triangle park, nc).  xxxd2670xxx  was
obtained from penick laboratories (newark, nj). ptx

was obtained from list biological laboratories (campbell,
ca). [3h]-damgo was obtained from nen life sciences
(boston, ma). all compounds were dissolved in normal
saline (0.9%). doses were calculated as the free base.
2.6. data analysis
dose response data were analyzed by probit analysis
(finney, 1973) using a computerized program that estimates
the ed50 and 95% confidence limits. bmax and kd were
calculated from saturation studies using nonlinear regression
analysis (prism ver. 3.0, graphpad software, san diego, ca).
significant differences among the data were analyzed using
anova with appropriate post hoc comparisons. all saturation data were best fit by a one-site model.

3. results
3.1. the effect of ptx on morphine analgesic potency and
tolerance
the mice tolerated ptx treatment well. although ptxtreated mice weighed less than saline-treated mice (  3 g)
prior to dose – response testing, this difference was not
significant ( p > .05). furthermore, ptx treatment resulted
in less than 3% mortality versus  1% for saline-treated
mice. baseline tail-flick latencies did not differ significantly
( p > .05) between saline- and ptx-treated mice.

fig. 2. the effect of ptx treatment on opioid agonist-induced m-opioid
receptor regulation in brain. mice were injected with saline (sal) or ptx
(0.1 mg/site). after 10 days, mice were treated with  xxxd2070xxx  (150 or
200 mg/kg/day) or morphine for 3 days. at the end of treatment, m-opioid
receptor binding ([3h]-damgo) was determined in the whole brain (see
materials and methods). each bar is the mean ( ± s.e.m) percent of control
(saline – placebo) bmax from 3 to 12 experiments determined in saturation
binding studies. the mean bmax of the control group was 240 ± 20 fm/mg
protein. * significantly different from the control ( p < .05).

ptx significantly reduced the analgesic potency of
morphine by approximately 11-fold in placebo-treated mice
(fig. 1). both morphine and  xxxd2070xxx  treatment produced
tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine.  xxxd2070xxx 
infusion (150 and 200 mg/kg/day) produced a significant
3.5- and 5.9-fold shift in morphine analgesic potency with
respect to control (fig. 1). similarly, morphine treatment
produced a significant 4.9-fold shift in morphine analgesic
potency with respect to control. when ptx was combined
with opioid agonist treatment, there was no further development of tolerance relative to the ptx-treated controls.
neither ptx – xxxd2070xxx  nor ptx – morphine groups were
significantly different from ptx –placebo. however, both
groups were significantly different from mice not treated
with ptx. taken together, ptx pretreatment blocked
the development of further tolerance to both  xxxd2070xxx 
and morphine.
3.2. the effect of ptx on m-opioid receptor density

fig. 1. the effect of ptx on opioid tolerance. mice were injected with
saline (sal) or ptx (0.1 mg/site). after 10 days, mice were treated with
 xxxd2070xxx  (150 or 200 mg/kg/day) or morphine for 3 days (see materials and
methods). at the end of treatment, the morphine ed50 was determined.
data are presented as the ed50 shift, which is the ratio of the ed50 of the
treated groups to that of the control (saline – placebo). each bar is the mean
( ± s.e.m) of 3 – 10 experiments. the mean morphine analgesic ed50 for
the control (saline – placebo) was 2.40 ± 0.22 mg/kg. * significantly
different from the control. + ptx – placebo, ptx –  xxxd2070xxx  (150 and
200 mg/kg/day) and ptx – morphine are significantly different from saline –
 xxxd2070xxx  (150 and 200 mg/kg/day) and saline – morphine, but not significantly different from each other ( p < .05).

ptx treatment had no effect on m-receptor density in the
whole brain (fig. 2), spinal cord, or midbrain (table 1).
continuous  xxxd2070xxx  infusion (150 and 200 mg/kg/day)
produced a significant decrease (19% and 25%, respectively) in the bmax for [3h]-damgo in the whole brain
(fig. 2). similar changes were observed for spinal cord and
midbrain from  xxxd2070xxx -treated (200 mg/kg/day) mice
(table 1). morphine had no effect on m-opioid receptor
density either in the absence or presence of ptx. when
ptx and  xxxd2070xxx  treatments were combined, etorphineinduced down-regulation was not altered (fig. 2, table 1).
morphine treatment did not produce any change in receptor

4. discussion
opioid receptors, like other gpcr, can undergo adaptations following agonist treatment (law et al., 2000). these
include receptor desensitization, internalization, and downregulation. although the initial step in opioid receptor signal
transduction involves g-protein-mediated activation of
intracellular systems (e.g., adenylyl cyclase, ion channels),
the role that g-proteins play in receptor internalization,
down-regulation, and tolerance in the intact animal was
unclear. in the present study, the contribution of ptxsensitive g-proteins to these effects was examined using
an intact animal model of m-opioid receptor regulation and
tolerance. our results indicate a role for ptx-sensitive
g-proteins in tolerance but not in the down-regulation
of m-receptors.
virtually all opioid agonists have been shown to produce
some degree of tolerance (kato et al., 1998; yu et al., 1997;
goode and raffa, 1997; duttaroy and yoburn, 1995).
typically, only high-intrinsic-efficacy agonists promote
receptor internalization and down-regulation in cell culture
and intact animal systems (zaki et al., 2000; whistler et al.,
1999; kato et al., 1998; yabaluri and medzihradsky, 1997;
law et al., 1985). this distinction in the ability of opioid
agonists to regulate receptor trafficking implies that there is
a difference between the intracellular mechanisms activated
by high and low intrinsic efficacy opioid agonists. since
g-protein activation is believed to be the first step in opioid

receptor signaling (shen et al., 1998; standifer et al., 1996;
raffa et al., 1994; cox, 1993), it represents an important
intracellular target to evaluate for possible differential
activation by opioid agonists.
the inactivation of gi/o-proteins dramatically reduces
acute opioid agonist potency (e.g., shen et al., 1998;
standifer et al., 1996; sanchez-blazquez et al., 1995; raffa
et al., 1994). the present results confirm that ptx-sensitive
g-proteins are involved in the acute potency of opioids.
based on the reduction in acute opioid potency, it was
anticipated that interference with gi/o-protein function
would also affect tolerance. when animals treated with
ptx were infused with morphine or  xxxd2070xxx , there was
no further decrease in agonist potency. thus, treatment with
ptx, which shifted the ed50 by approximately 11-fold,
blocked any further reductions in opioid potency by chronic
morphine or  xxxd2070xxx  exposure. as such, there was no
opioid tolerance in ptx-treated mice as compared to ptxalone groups. these results are in agreement with data that
indicate that ptx treatment partially reduces opioid dependence produced by morphine (parolaro et al., 1990). thus,
chronic opioid effects such as tolerance and dependence
appear to be mediated by ptx-sensitive g-proteins.
as noted in earlier reports (keith et al., 1996; yabaluri
and medzihradsky, 1997; stafford et al., 2001), morphine
treatment had no significant effect on m-receptor density,
regardless of whether mice were treated with ptx. similarly,
ptx treatment alone did not affect m-opioid receptor number
or affinity, as reported previously (see chang et al., 1991). in
contrast, the high-intrinsic-efficacy agonist  xxxd2070xxx  downregulated m-opioid receptors in brain, cord, and midbrain.
furthermore, unlike opioid-induced tolerance, which was
absent in ptx-treated mice, down-regulation induced by
 xxxd2070xxx  was intact following ptx treatment (fig. 2,
table 1). taken together, these data indicate that highintrinsic-efficacy agonists down-regulate m-opioid receptors
via a ptx-insensitive mechanism. interestingly, opioid
receptor up-regulation induced by chronic opioid antagonist
treatment is also unaffected by ptx treatment (chang et al.,
1991), a finding that suggests that opioid receptor regulation
in vivo may be generally independent of g-protein signaling.
the present results extend observations that ptx-sensitive g-proteins are required for the acute and chronic
functional effects of opioids (burford et al., 1998; parolaro
et al., 1990; shah et al., 1997; yabaluri and medzihradsky,
1997; zaki et al., 2000). in addition, these results are
consistent with cell culture studies that show g-proteins
are, at best, only partially involved in down-regulation
induced by high-intrinsic-efficacy agonists (e.g., zaki et al.,
2000; kato et al., 1998; yabaluri and medzihradsky., 1997;
law et al., 1985). however, the exact mechanisms that
mediate down-regulation are unclear. it is possible that highintrinsic-efficacy opioid agonists may shift the m-opioid
receptor into a conformation that is a more optimal target
for phosphorylation. agonists such as damgo and  xxxd2070xxx  that cause down-regulation have been shown to

b.a. gomes et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 72 (2002) 273–278

produce more phosphorylation of receptors than morphine
(yu et al., 1997; zhang et al., 1998). receptor phosphorylation by g-protein receptor kinases (grk) may allow
adapter proteins like b-arrestin to bind and direct receptor
trafficking (ferguson et al., 1998). that morphine-activated
m-receptors are a less than optimal target for b-arrestin and
grks is supported by cell culture studies in which morphine causes internalization of the m-opioid receptor when
grk or b-arrestin are overexpressed in cells (whistler and
von zastrow, 1998; zhang et al., 1998).
taken together, this study provides insight into the
relationship between g-protein activation and regulation
of receptor number and tolerance in the intact animal. our
findings indicate that g-proteins have a minimal role in the
regulation of the m-opioid receptor but appear to play an
important role in the development of tolerance and the acute
effects of opioids.
