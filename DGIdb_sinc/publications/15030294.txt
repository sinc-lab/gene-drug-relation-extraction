irbesartan is a long-acting  xxxg99xxx  antagonist acting specifically at the level of the
type 1-receptor subtype (at1-receptor). this compound lowers blood pressure dosedependently in hypertensive patients and has a placebo-like tolerability. the
antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan is greatly enhanced by the coadministration of a
diuretic, and fixed-dose combinations of  xxxd2382xxx  are now
available. irbesartan-based treatment appears especially effective for high-risk
patients, such as those with diabetes, renal disease and cardiac hypertrophy. in patients
with type 2 diabetes, irbesartan delays the development of nephropathy as well as the
progression of renal failure. irbesartan may have antiatherosclerotic properties beyond
those expected from blood pressure lowering per se: this at1-blocker decreases the
vascular oxidative stress and prevents the procoagulant as well as the pro-inflammatory
effects of  xxxg99xxx . irbesartan given alone or in combination with a diuretic
therefore represents a rational approach to treat hypertensive patients.

the renin–angiotensin system (ras) plays a
pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure and contributes to the development and
the maintenance of high blood pressure in a
large fraction of hypertensive patients. it is
now possible to establish a chronic blockade
of this system by using  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors, which prevent
the generation of  xxxg99xxx  from  xxxg99xxx , and  xxxg99xxx  antagonists,
which bind selectively to the subtype 1  xxxg99xxx  (at1) receptor [1,2]. both ace
inhibitors and at1-receptor blockers are
now widely used for the treatment of hypertension and are considered to be a valuable
option to initiate antihypertensive therapy
[3]. these two classes of medications are very
similar in terms of antihypertensive efficacy
[1,2]. at 1-receptor blockers, however, are better tolerated, mainly because they do not
cause cough, a prominent side effect of
ace inhibitors [4].

long-acting at1-receptor blocker which is now
available in many countries [5]. this review
will summarize the clinical experience accumulated to date with this compound in the
treatment of hypertension.
overview of the market

at1-receptor blockers are increasingly used
for the management of hypertension, both
as monotherapy and in combination with
diuretics [6]. the main advantage of these
agents is their placebo-like tolerability
which favors long-term compliance [1,2,6].
recent controlled trials performed in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and in
hypertensive patients with cardiac hypertrophy have demonstrated significantly better
protective effects of at1-receptor blockadebased treatment compared with other established therapeutic modalities [7–9]. several
at1-receptor blockers have been developed
during recent years, including candesartan,
eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan,
 xxxd3303xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  [6,10].

figure 1. chemical structure of irbesartan.

in patients with essential hypertension, monotherapy with
irbesartan shows a clear dose-response relationship over a dose
range of 1–900 mg once daily but only modest additional
blood pressure reductions are observed with doses of over
300 mg [15]. the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan does
not vary in subgroups of patients with respect to age, gender,
or race [16]. notably, heart rate is not altered by at1-receptor
blockade with irbesartan.
renal plasma flow increases in hypertensive patients treated
with irbesartan, although glomerular filtration rate and urinary
sodium excretion remain constant [17].

introduction to the compound

irbesartan is an orally-active at1-receptor blocker characterized
by a high selectivity and potency [11]. it has been developed by
sanofi-synthelabo and bristol-myers squibb.
chemistry

irbesartan is chemically described as 2-butyl-3-[(2´-(1h-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl)]-1,3-diazaspiro(4,4)non-1-en4-one (figure 1).
pharmacodynamics
healthy subjects

pharmacokinetics
absorption & distribution

irbesartan is almost completely absorbed after oral administration, with a bioavailability of 60–80% [18]. the coadministration of food with either irbesartan or the fixed-dose combination of  xxxd2382xxx  ( xxxd2294xxx ) does not
affect its bioavailability or other pharmacokinetic parameters
[19,20]. in healthy subjects, peak plasma irbesartan concentrations (cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration–time curve (auc) increase linearly with the dose,
whereas the time-to-cmax (tmax) is dose-independent [21]. a single dose of 150 mg irbesartan produces within 1.5 h a cmax
value of 1.9 µg/ml and an auc value of 9.7 µg·h/ml. the corresponding values of cmax and auc after a single oral dose of
300 mg irbesartan are 2.9 µg/ml and 20.0 µg·h/ml, respectively [21]. drug steady-state levels are reached within 3 days of
multiple dosing, with no evidence of accumulation over a

in healthy volunteers, irbesartan given orally causes a dosedependent inhibition of the pressor response to exogenous
 xxxg99xxx  [12,13]. at the 2- and 4-h time points after dosing with 150 and 300 mg, the doses recommended for the
treatment of hypertension, the irbesartan-induced blockade
is nearly complete and the inhibitory effect still exceeds 50%
after 24 h. compared with other
at1-receptor blockers (losartan,  xxxd3487xxx ), the irbesartan-induced blockade
was significantly more pronounced and

irbesartan

1-week administration [21]. irbesartan is about 96% bound to
plasma proteins and has a large volume of distribution (53–93 l)
[22]. it does not require biotransformation to an active metabolite
for pharmacologic activity.
metabolism & elimination

irbesartan and its metabolites are excreted by both biliary and
renal routes [18]. the primary routes of metabolism are glucuronide conjugation and oxidation, with cytochrome p450
isoenzyme cyp2c9 being the major oxidation pathway [23].
dosage adjustment is not required based on patient age, gender or race, as well as for patients with renal failure (including
patients on hemodialysis) and those with mild to moderate
hepatic insufficiency [24–26].
drug interactions

the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan given in the therapeutic
dose range are not altered when administered with nifedipine,
 xxxd2294xxx , digoxin,  xxxd3394xxx , antacids, cimetidine, simvastatin
or warfarin [27]. irbesartan does not alter renal hemodynamics
or renal salt handling when combined with a cyclooxygenase
(cox)-2 inhibitor in slightly volume-depleted subjects with
normal renal function [28].
clinical efficacy
assessment of blood pressure at the clinic

a large number of controlled trials carried out in essential
hypertensive patients have established the antihypertensive
efficacy of irbesartan at oral daily doses of 150 or 300 mg, in
comparison with either placebo or other monotherapies, by
measuring blood pressure conventionally in a clinical setting.
irbesartan was always found to be significantly superior in lowering blood pressure than placebo [15]. in the double-blind trials that have evaluated the effects of irbesartan against agents
from other major classes of antihypertensives (thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ace inhibitors), very
similar blood pressure reductions were observed [29]. this was
the case, for example, for: irbesartan 150 mg and  xxxd2294xxx 
12.5 mg administered once a day [30]; for irbesartan and atenolol titrated to once-daily doses of 150 and 100 mg, respectively [31]; for irbesartan 150 mg and amlodipine 5 mg given
once a day [32]; and for irbesartan and enalapril titrated to
once-daily doses of 300 and 40 mg, respectively [33]. irbesartan
was also compared with the at1-receptor blocker losartan. in
one study, irbesartan 300 mg once daily provided a better therapeutic response than once-daily doses of either irbesartan
150 mg or losartan 100 mg [34]. in an elective titration study,
150–300 mg irbesartan administered once daily produced a
significantly greater blood pressure reduction than 50–100 mg
losartan once daily [35]. in all of these trials, the duration of the
treatment was 4–12 weeks.
a special mention should be given to the combination of
irbesartan with  xxxd2294xxx . there is indeed a very strong rationale
to support the association of these two types of agents. diureticinduced salt depletion triggers the release of renin, which limits

the antihypertensive efficacy one might expect from the change
in sodium balance. during blockade of the ras, the blood
pressure effects of the reactive hyper-reninemia are prevented,
which considerably increases the antihypertensive efficacy of
diuretic therapy. this could be confirmed in a 4 × 4 placebocontrolled matrix study conducted with 683 patients with mildto-moderate hypertension [30]. these patients were randomized
to one of 16 different, double-blind combinations of irbesartan
(0, 37.5, 100 and 300 mg once daily) and  xxxd2294xxx  (0, 6.25, 12.5
and 25 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. mean reductions from baseline in blood pressures and normalization and total responder
rates increased in a dose-dependent manner in both the irbesartan and the  xxxd2294xxx  groups, as well as in the irbesartan/ xxxd2294xxx  groups (figure 3). irbesartan plus  xxxd2294xxx  produced additive reductions in blood pressure and the
combination of the two drugs was more effective than either
drug given alone.
assessment of blood pressure by noninvasive
ambulatory monitoring

noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (abpm)
is particularly useful for evaluating the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs. it provides a large number of blood pressure
readings during the day- and night-time, which results in a
more precise assessment of prevailing blood pressure than can
be obtained from sporadic clinic measurements and allows the
precise definition of the profile of the blood-pressure-lowering
effect of a given drug [36]. the main advantage of abpm is
that it enables better characterization of the patient’s blood
pressure during their everyday activities and avoidance of the
“white-coat” pressor effect.
twenty-four-hour abpm was used to compare the blood
pressure lowering effects of irbesartan 75 mg once a day, irbesartan 150 mg once a day, irbesartan 75 mg twice a day and
placebo [37]. a total of 215 hypertensive patients were randomized to the different regimens for 8-week treatment periods.
blood pressure was significantly lowered by the three irbesartan regimens as compared with placebo. no difference was
observed during the daytime between the three active treatment groups. irbesartan controlled night-time blood pressure
equally well whether it was administered at a dose of 150 mg
once daily or at a dose of 75 mg twice daily, whereas there was
no difference at the end of the nocturnal dosing interval
between the once-daily 75 mg dose of irbesartan and placebo.
the placebo-adjusted trough:peak ratios for systolic and
diastolic blood pressures were 66 and 74% for the 150 mg
once-daily dose, respectively, as compared with 56 and 66%
for the 75 mg twice-daily dose, respectively. this clearly shows
that irbesartan is a long-acting at1-receptor blocker that can
be administered once daily.
the comparative antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan and
 xxxd3487xxx  was recently studied in 426 hypertensive patients using
abpm. the patients were randomized to receive either irbesartan
150 mg once daily or  xxxd3487xxx  80 mg once daily for a period of
8 weeks [38]. irbesartan demonstrated significantly greater blood

conclusions

 xxxg99xxx  is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension
in a large number of patients. there is increasing evidence that
this pressor peptide also plays an important role in the development of target-organ damage. one should therefore question
whether irbesartan, by blocking at1 receptors, has protective

www.future-drugs.com

effects that are greater than one might expect from the blood
pressure lowering per se.
cardiac effects of irbesartan

left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an early complication of
hypertension and is considered today as a strong independent
risk factor for life-threatening cardiovascular events [45].
recently, the at1-receptor blocker losartan was shown in a
double-masked, randomized, parallel-group trial involving
9193 patients with essential hypertension and lvh to be more
effective in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality

27

waeber & burnier

than the beta-blocker atenolol [9]. the difference in outcome was
observed despite the fact that the two treatments provided similar blood pressure reductions, suggesting that at1-receptor
blockade confers benefits beyond blood pressure lowering.
reversal of lvh can also be obtained with irbesartan. in a
double-blind study, 115 hypertensive patients with lvh were
randomly allocated to a 48-week treatment with either irbesartan 150 mg once a day or atenolol 50 mg once a day [46].
the doses of the two agents could be doubled and additional
medications ( xxxd2294xxx  and the calcium antagonist  xxxd2092xxx )
prescribed as needed if diastolic blood pressure remained above
90 mmhg. the two treatments were equally effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure but irbesartan led to a
significantly greater reduction in left ventricular mass index
(-26 g/m2) than atenolol (-14 g/m2). some gene polymorphisms of  xxxg99xxx  and the at1-receptor were related
to the changes in left ventricular mass during irbesartan treatment but not during atenolol treatment, which points to a
crucial role of the ras in the development of lvh [47].
qt dispersion, as defined by the difference between maximal
and minimal qt intervals within a 12-lead surface electrocardiogram, is increased in hypertensive patients [48], especially in
those with lvh [49]. this abnormality may be an early indicator of cardiac damage in hypertension and might be associated
with an enhanced risk of malignant arrhythmias and of sudden
cardiac death. the effects of irbesartan (75–150 mg once a day)
and of amlodipine (5–10 mg once a day) on qt dispersion
were studied in a double-blind trial including 104 elderly
patients with essential hypertension [50]. a significant reduction
in qt dispersion was seen in the irbesartan-treated patients but
not in those allocated to the calcium antagonist. these results
were obtained for equivalent blood pressure normalization rates
in the two treatment arms. it remains unknown, however,
whether this favorable effect of irbesartan improves the prognosis
of hypertensive patients.
renal effects of irbesartan

diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of renal failure in western countries and hypertension is a major factor predisposing to the development of renal failure in patients with
type 2 diabetes [51]. two interventional trials looking at the
effects of irbesartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes
have recently been compared [7,8].
the first study (the irbesartan microalbuminuria type 2
diabetes in hypertensive patients [irma ii] study) aimed to
compare the effects of irbesartan and placebo on the progression from microalbuminuria to overt proteinuria [8]. to this
end, 590 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and
microalbuminuria were randomly allocated to a 2-year treatment with irbesartan (one group at a dose of 150 mg once
daily and one group at a dose of 300 mg once daily), or matching placebo. a target blood pressure was set in the three groups
at less than 135/85 mmhg. to reach this goal, additional antihypertensive medications could be used, including diuretics,
beta-blockers, calcium antagonists (except dihydropyridines) and

28

alpha-blockers, but ace inhibitors were not allowed. the blood
pressure control obtained during the study was similar in the
three treatment groups. the average through blood pressure
throughout the follow-up was 144/83 mmhg in the placebo
group, 143/83 mmhg in the irbesartan 150 mg group and
141/83 mmhg in the irbesartan 300 mg group. the fraction
of patients having developed diabetic nephropathy (defined as
the conversion of microalbuminuria to albuminuria during
the course of the study) was lower in the irbesartan 300 mg
(5.2%) and the irbesartan 150 mg (9.7%) than in the placebo
group (14.9%). the difference achieved, however, was of a
significant level only between the placebo- and the irbesartan
300 mg-treated patients (p < 0.001). restoration of normoalbuminuria during the study was also statistically more
frequent (p < 0.006) in patients allocated to irbesartan
150 mg (34%) than in those randomized to placebo (21%).
these data show convincingly that an irbesartan-based drug
regimen has a renoprotective effect in hypertensive patients
with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria and that this beneficial effect is larger than that attributable to the decrease in
blood pressure by itself.
the second study performed with irbesartan has examined
the potential of this drug in slowing the progression of diabetic
nephropathy and protecting against cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality [7]. this trial, known as the irbesartan in diabetic nephropathy trial (idnt), included 1715 hypertensive
patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. the diagnosis of nephropathy was based on the presence of an urinary
albumin excretion of at least 900 mg/day and a serum creatinine concentration of 88–265 µm in women and 106–265
µm in men. the patients were randomly assigned to a treatment with either irbesartan (75–300 mg/day), amlodipine
(2.5–10 mg/day) or placebo. in all three groups there was the
possibility to add other types of antihypertensive agents if
required to achieve a target blood pressure of 135/85 mmhg
or less. the use of ace inhibitors,  xxxg99xxx  antagonists
and calcium antagonists was, however, not permitted. the
mean follow-up averaged 2.6 years. the mean of blood pressures measured during the course of the study was
140/77 mmhg in the irbesartan group, 141/77 mmhg in the
amlodipine group and slightly higher, at 144/80 mmhg in the
placebo group. the primary outcome was the composite of a
doubling of the baseline serum creatinine concentration, the
development of end-stage renal disease, or death of any cause.
the relative risk of this composite end point was 20% lower in
the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (p < 0.02) and
23% lower than in the amlodipine group (p < 0.006) (table 1).
irbesartan treatment also had a significant beneficial effect on
the risk of a doubling of serum creatinine concentration as well
as on the risk of end-stage renal disease. there was, however,
no difference in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
between the three treatment groups but a 37% reduction in
the risk of cardiac failure requiring hospitalization (p < 0.001)
was observed in the irbesartan group compared with the
amlodipine group. very similar results were reported with a

losartan-based drug regimen in hypertensive patients with
type 2 diabetes [52]. taken together, these intervention trials
point to a protection of the kidneys afforded by irbesartan that
cannot be accounted for exclusively by the blood pressure
reduction per se.
the beneficial effect of irbesartan on microalbuminuria is
not due exclusively to the decrease in systemic blood pressure induced by at1-receptor blockade. irbesartan was
indeed shown to reduce microalbuminuria not only in
hypertensive but also in normotensive patients with type 2
diabetes [53]. another point to be stressed is that the antiproteinuric effect of irbesartan can be enhanced by the coadministration of an ace inhibitor, as demonstrated in nondiabetic patients with glomerulonephritis [54]. interestingly,
this additive antiproteinuric effect on proteinuria was not
dependent on changes in systemic blood pressure but probably reflected a hemodynamic response limited to the intraglomerular circulation. finally, it should be mentioned that
irbesartan, either alone or given together with other antihypertensive drugs, is effective in lowering blood pressure,
reduces proteinuria and is well-tolerated in hypertensive patients
with chronic renal failure [55].
vascular effects of irbesartan

the structure and function of small as well as large arteries is
often altered in hypertensive patients [56,57]. a few studies were
performed recently to investigate the impact of irbesartan on
the vasculature.
in one trial, 55 hypertensive patients were randomized in a
double-blind manner to either irbesartan 150 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks [58]. the wall thickness of the common
carotid and radial arteries were determined using high-resolution echotracking techniques at the beginning and end of the
observation period. irbesartan significantly decreased blood
pressure and radial artery thickness but did not affect carotid
wall thickness.
other investigators compared the effects of irbesartan
150–300 mg once daily with those of atenolol 50–100 mg
once daily administered for 3 months [59]. endotheliumdependent and -independent vasodilation were assessed by

www.future-drugs.com

venous occlusion plethysmography during intra-arterial infusion
of metacholine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively. irbesartan and atenolol induced a similar decline in blood pressure and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation, with
no difference between the two study drugs. this improvement was seen in the absence of concurrent changes in
endothelium-independent vasodilation.
in another trial, irbesartan (at an average daily dose of
235 mg) was administered for 1 year to 12 hypertensive
patients after completion of a 1-year treatment with atenolol
(average daily dose of 73 mg) [60]. small resistance arteries were
dissected from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies performed before
and after each treatment phase. blood pressure control was
identical with irbesartan and atenolol. there was, however, a
significant decrease in the arterial media width-to-lumen ratio
following treatment with irbesartan, whereas atenolol had no
effect. the irbesartan-induced structural changes were associated with a significant improvement in endothelial function, as
reflected by a greater acetylcholine-mediated relaxation, suggesting that long-term at1-receptor blockade, unlike longterm beta-adrenoceptor blockade, has a protective effect on the
structure and the function of small resistance arteries.
during recent years,  xxxg99xxx  has emerged as a key
factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [61,62]. for
instance this peptide stimulates the production of oxygen
free radicals, exerts a potent inflammatory effect in the vascular wall by triggering the release of growth factors, cytokines
and chemokines and induces a procoagulant state by stimulating the plasminogen-activator inhibitor and by activating
platelets.  xxxg99xxx  is a stimulus for nadph oxidase,
leading to the generation of superoxide anion, which is converted by superoxide dismutases to  xxxd2298xxx . the
 xxxg99xxx -mediated increase in oxygen-derived free radicals can cause endothelial dysfunction by inactivating no
and by enhanced the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein
(ldl) to oxidized ldl (ox-ldl). it now appears that oxldl upregulates the at1-receptor expression on endothelial
and vascular smooth muscle cells [63,64] and that  xxxg99xxx 
facilitates the uptake of ox-ldl by scavenger receptors on
monocytes/macrophages [65].

key issues
• irbesartan is a long-acting  xxxg99xxx  antagonist, acting specifically at the level of the type-1 receptor subtype (at1).
• in healthy volunteers, irbesartan administered orally causes a dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor response to exogenous
 xxxg99xxx .
• in hypertensive patients, irbesartan lowers blood pressure dose-dependently.
• in hypertensive patients, the blood pressure-lowering effect of irbesartan is very similar to that of other classes of antihypertensives.
• irbesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide is more effective in lowering blood pressure than either drug administered alone.
• in hypertensive patients, irbesartan has a placebo-like tolerability.
• the persistence with irebesartan therapy is better than that of other classes of antihypertensive agents.
• in patients with type 2 diabetes, irbesartan-based treatment delays the development of nephropathy as well as the progression of
renal failure.
• in hypertensive patients, irbesartan prevents the procoagulant as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of  xxxg99xxx .
• irbesartan decreases the vascular oxidative stress in patients with coronary heart disease.
