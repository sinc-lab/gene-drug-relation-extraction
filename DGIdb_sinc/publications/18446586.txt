gaba receptor insecticide
non-competitive antagonists may bind
at allosteric modulator sites

results from several studies have shown that a series of chemically distinct
insecticide compounds ( xxxd2947xxx , bidn, tbps, ﬁpronil, lindane, ebob, and
alpha-endosulfan) affect gabaa receptor function. in this investigation, docking of
this set of insecticides to the gaba receptor identiﬁed ﬁve potential binding sites.
the lowest energy site was found within the base of the transmembrane bundle,
interacting with m2 but not in the pore, and includes many of the residues previously
experimentally implicated in insecticide binding. many of the binding modes are
suggestive of a non-competitive allosteric mechanism based on interruption of the
channel gating mechanism rather than directly blocking the channel. the results
also distinguished between isomers of hexachlorohexane ( xxxd2488xxx ), where gamma - xxxd2488xxx 
(lindane) binds more favorably than  xxxd2488xxx . the results suggest multiple sites for
insecticide binding and may suggest further mutagenesis and labeling work to either
conﬁrm or rule out these ﬁndings.

introduction
the gamma -amino-butyric acid (gaba) a-type receptor (gabar) is an important
protein component of many inhibitory synapses in the neuronal systems of
both vertebrates and invertebrates. gabar is a member of the cys loop
 xxxg903xxx  (lgic) family, and mediates gabaergic synaptic
transmission. such receptors are targets for a wide range of neuroactive
drugs and chemicals (olsen et al., 2004), such as barbituates (drafts &
fisher, 2006), benzodiazepines (berezhnoy et al., 2004), anesthetics (belelli
et al., 1999), alcohol (mihic, 1999), neurosteroids (fancsik et al., 2000), and
insecticides (zhang et al., 1995). even more interesting affects arise due to the
simultaneous interaction of more than one of these compounds with gabars
(paronis, 2006). insecticides are a commonly used class of compounds that
target gabars, as well as sodium channels (raymond-delpech et al., 2005),
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) (buckingham et al., 2005; thany
et al., 2007), ryanodine receptors (lahm et al., 2005), and acetylcholinesterase
(hancock et al., 2007). insecticides are chemically very diverse (olsen, 2006).
previous studies have suggested that the interactions of pesticides with the
gaba receptor may involve multiple, potentially overlapping, binding sites
(kalueff, 2007). most gabaergic insecticides can act on the human gabar
as well as their insect counterparts. a better understanding of the mechanisms
of action of the insecticides at the receptor may help us to design more
potent, target-speciﬁc compounds, in terms of more effective, species speciﬁc
pesticides, or gaba-ergic neurotropic drugs to treat a wide range of diseases
(dawson et al., 2000). this article investigates the interaction of a diverse set of
insecticide compounds with the main human brain form of the gaba receptor:
 xxxg830xxx (2)  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx (2) gamma 2. recent evidence suggests that the compounds may all bind at the

gaba receptor sites for insecticides

707

same site (chen et al., 2006), but from the vast array of available mutagenesis
data (kalueff, 2007) the probability is that these compounds interact with the
receptor at different sites or maybe even multiple sites simultaneously.
the mechanism of the gabar channel function (sine & engel, 2006) is
such that a non-competitive antagonist (nca) does not need to directly block
the channel to prevent ion conduction. an allosteric inhibition mechanism
would indirectly prevent the gating mechanism of the channel from occurring.
ligands can bind in sites within either the ligand-binding domain (lbd), or
the transmembrane domain (tmd), that are not the same as the agonist binding
site. if ligands were to bind within the helical bundle of the transmembrane
subunits, or even between them, they would more indirectly inﬂuence channel
conduction. this might alter channel activity via direct inﬂuence on the
conformation/position of the m2 helix or by altering the twist and breathe
to open mechanism of the protein (chang & weiss, 2002; unwin, 2003; law
et al., 2005; cheng et al., 2006) as well as potentially operating via direct
channel blocking (behrends, 2000; chen et al., 2006).
the present authors have investigated the docking of six insecticide
compounds, plus an inactive isomer of  xxxd2488xxx , to a model of gabar (figure 1).
lindane ( xxxd2488xxx  (gamma - xxxd2488xxx )) is used to treat humans
for head lice and scabies and as a crop pesticide. due to the stereo-isomeric
properties of the  xxxd2488xxx  compound, the sensitivity of the model and the
method were tested by docking two isomers of  xxxd2488xxx . only lindane, with
its 1alpha, 2alpha, 3beta, 4alpha, 5alpha,  xxxd1946xxx  arrangement of chlorines, is an active pesticide
of the eight possible  xxxd2488xxx  stereoisomers. the authors therefore also tested
the stereoselectivity by docking lindane (gamma - xxxd2488xxx ) and  xxxd2488xxx  (1alpha, 2beta, 3alpha,
4beta, 5alpha,  xxxd1946xxx  arrangement of chlorines).  xxxd2947xxx  (ptx) is a natural plant
toxin obtained from the menispermacae moonseed plant. it has been used
as a pesticide and even as an antidote to barbituate overdose (windholz
et al., 1976). conversely, ptx poisoning can be reversed with barbituate or
benzodiazepine drugs, which are thought to bind at the ligand binding domain
(lbd) alpha−gamma interface of gabar (berezhnoy et al., 2004), but  xxxd2947xxx 
has been shown to bind at a site other than that for benzodiazepines and
the anesthetic compound, loreclezole (berezhnoy et al., 2005). it is these
complex allosteric interactions that need to be better understood. endosulfan is
another organochlorine pesticide for which the alpha form (alpha-endosulfan) is most
commonly used. the other insecticide compounds investigated were ﬁpronil,
ebob
(1-(4-ethynylphenyl)-4-n-propyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2,2,2]octane),
bidn (3,3-bis-triﬂuoromethyl-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2,2-dicarbonitrile), and
the bicyclophosphate molecule tbps (t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate).

figure 1. a diverse set of insecticide compounds, plus betahch, were investigated in this study: alpha-endosulfan, bidn: 3,3-bis-triﬂuoromethyl-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2,2dicarbonitrile, ebob: 1-(4-ethynylphenyl)-4-n-propyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, tbps:
t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, ptx:  xxxd2947xxx , lindane (gamma  xxxd2488xxx : gamma-hexachlorohexane),
and fipronil.

although this docking study is limited, it does show the possibility of sites
other than the intracellular end of m2/central pore as being potential binding
sites for the insecticides. the present results are consistent with available
mutation data and help explain other experiments. in other cases, these results
may propose other possible sites of interaction.

methods
gaba receptor modeling
the alpha1beta2gamma 2 gabar was built using the full em structure of the torpedo marmorata  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) (pdb: 1oed) (miyazawa
et al., 2003). a multiple alignment of 40 cys loop lgic subunits, plus achbp
was constructed using psi-blast (altschul et al., 1997) to obtain the sequences and clustalw (thompson et al., 1994) to create the multiple alignment.
this equivalence of the gabar beta to nachr alpha, with respect to the agonist
binding site, explains the decision to model gabar beta subunits on the alpha subunits of the template structure. gaba gamma was modeled on the template  xxxg217xxx .
therefore four separate pairwise alignments were required as input for
each homology model: tm.nachr-alpha → gabar- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , tm.nachr-gamma → gabar- xxxg830xxx ,
tm.nachr-beta → gabar-gamma 2, and tm.nachr-delta → gabar- xxxg830xxx . the constructed

alignments and models were checked and reﬁned versus available data
concerning equivalent or important residues both for nicotinic (imoto et al.,
1988; bouzat et al., 2004; lummis et al., 2005; sine & engel, 2006) and gaba
receptors (xu et al., 1995; kash et al., 2003; ernst et al., 2005; horenstein et al.,
2005; jung et al., 2005; jansen & akabas, 2006; mercado & czajkowski, 2006).
these were also compared to some other data for glycine and 5-ht3 receptors
(xiu et al., 2005)—two other members of the cys loop lgic family. analysis
of the multiple sequence alignment and use of secondary structure showed
that the cytoplasmic helix present in the tm nachr structure was likely not
conserved in the gabar subunits; therefore, this section of the protein was not
included in the model. modeling was performed by inputting the template and
target alignments to modeller (sali et al., 1997). protein quality was checked
with procheck (laskowski et al., 1993), whatcheck (hooft et al., 1996), and
prosa (sippl, 1993) as part of an iterative process of model reﬁnement.
insecticide docking protocol
structures of eight compounds ( xxxd2488xxx , lindane,  xxxd2947xxx , alpha-endosulfan,
ﬁpronil, ebob (1-(4-ethynylphenyl)-4-n-propyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2,2,2]
octane), bidn (3,3-bis-triﬂuoromethyl-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2,2-dicarbonitrile) and tbps (t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate), as shown in figure 1, were
built using chem3d pro with the chemdraw plugin (www.cambridgesoft.com).
each structure was minimized in-vacuo using mm2 within chem3d. gasteiger
charges were calculated and added for the atoms in the ligand using autodock
tools (morris et al., 1996). the protein model was prepared for docking
by merging non-polar hydrogens into groups for the kollman united atom
set forceﬁeld (yang et al., 2006) and adding kollman charges and stouten
desolvation terms for each atom. a 220 × 220 × 150 point grid, with
0.375å spacing was used to search the whole transmembrane domain of
the pentameric receptor. autogrid was then used to calculate the potential
interactions between the ligand and protein atoms for the proposed grid.
docking was performed using autodock 3.0.5 (morris et al., 1998). all torsions
were allowed for the ligands as part of a ﬂexible lamarkian genetic algorithm
(lga) based docking routine, with 100 ga runs for each ligand on the
whole pentameric transmembrane domain of the gabar model. modes of
binding were separated with a 1 å rmsd cut-off. the lowest energy structure
from each mode was selected, and each mode was energetically and visually
compared using vmd (humphrey et al., 1996). the calculation was performed
on a dual processor amd64 desktop computer from polywell. a second

docking protocol was then performed, focusing down on the center of the
channel to obtain docking energies for this region if it was not found by the
whole-transmembrane domain search protocol.

gaba receptor model
the gabar model produced was based on the structure of the torpedo
mamorata nachr structure (pdb: 2bg9) (unwin, 2005). the present gabar
model is similar to that published previously (o’mara et al., 2005); however,
because this model was based on a chimera of a nachr tm domain structure
(pbd: 1oed) (miyazawa et al., 2003) and the ach binding protein (achbp)
(pdb:1i9b) (brejc et al., 2001), important differences exist that may inﬂuence
studies to determine biological information from the structure (cheng et al.,
2006). these differences may be especially important at the interface between
the tm and binding domains (bouzat et al., 2004; lummis et al. 2005; sine
& engel, 2006). the tm domain is not a tightly packed structure and has
regions of low whatcheck atom packing score (results not shown). these
regions are the site of hydrophobic pockets in the structure and present many
opportunities for ligands to bind (ernst et al., 2005). cavities in membrane
proteins, often observed as packing deﬁciencies in the protein structure, are
potentially important functional sites (hildebrand et al., 2005). binding of
ligands to these cavities may cause conformational shifts related to alterations
in the function of the channel (chang & weiss, 2002).

five distinct binding sites found
the docking search of the pentameric transmembrane domain found several
potential binding sites for the insecticide compounds. five binding sites were
repeatedly found in the model by the docking calculations. as would be
expected, not all the ligands found all the sites during the search although
every one of the potential binding sites was found by more than one of the
compounds. the results for each ligand, with the lowest observed docking
energies for each site, are shown in table 1. each binding site found is described
in detail later (figure 2). intriguingly, the binding site most often ranked highest
in the docking search was a site consistent with the published mutation data
(chen et al., 2006), but this site is not in the pore. instead, this binding site
is located at the opposite face of the m2 helix, at the base of and within the

four helical bundle (base-tm) that makes up each of the ﬁve transmembrane
subunits (figure 2b). six of the eight compounds have the base-tm site ranked
highest of the sites found. alpha-endosulfan found the base-tm site but ranked it
third. only ﬁpronil did not ﬁnd the base-tm site within the 100 docking runs.
fipronil appeared to favor docking at a site previously indicated to be the site
of anesthetic binding in gabar (bali & akabas, 2004).  xxxd2947xxx  and bidn
found all 5 sites but showed a reasonably strong preference for the base-tm
location. the beta form of  xxxd2488xxx  was the least promiscuous of the ligands, only
ﬁnding two sites during the whole tm domain search protocol—that of the
base-tm and the anesthetic binding site. conversely, the gamma form of  xxxd2488xxx ,
known as lindane, found all the sites and bound to the base-tm site with
signiﬁcantly higher afﬁnity. tbps appears from the docking energies to have
relatively low afﬁnity for gabar compared to the other compounds. ebob,
tbps, and  xxxd2488xxx  did not ﬁnd the central pore blocking site, and all the other
ligands had it ranked as the highest energy (lowest ranked) location. this low
ranking of the pore site was conﬁrmed by forcing the ligands to dock in this
area with a more focused grid.
the ﬁve sites are illustrated in figure 2, and the residues involved are
indicated in the partial alignment in figure 3. the gabar model investigated
was the alpha1beta2gamma 2 subtype; therefore, it contained three different gabar
subunits and four different subunit interfaces. subsequently, equivalent sites
were sometimes found in more than one subunit or at more than one interface.
for most compounds, the highest ranked (or only one found) site was in the
beta-subunit or beta−alpha and gamma −beta interfaces. the limitations of the model, and the
docking method, precludes us from making precise conclusions about subunit
speciﬁcity from these results alone, although some changes in potency are
seen for different receptor subtypes, especially for ﬁpronil (ratra & casida,
2001). for the purposes of simplicity though, this article will discuss each
binding site in terms of the sequence and structure of the beta-subunit, even
though many equivalent sites were found in alpha. the  xxxg218xxx  was certainly less
well populated. the binding of ligands within the tm protein, in a pentameric
structure, presents the possibility that more than one ligand might bind at any
one time in order to produce its affect. this question of stoichiometry cannot
be answered easily. it should also be noted that the small energy differences
between sites found by each single compound are in most cases not large
enough (<1 kcal/mol) to make conﬁdent conclusions about ranking. but this
study shows a consistency of rank for the sites across multiple ligands. this
consistency can be observed in the lowest energies for each site shown in
table 1.

figure 2. five binding sites for the insecticides were found in the gabar. (a) these sites are
shown relative to the whole gabar structure as the colored ligands. the sites are shown for
just the beta-subunit, for clarity, but equivalent sites in all the subunits were found. panels b to f
are arranged in order in which the sites were, on average, ranked by docking of the compounds
(table 1). in (a) the red ebob ligand indicates the position of the base-tm binding site, shown
in (b). the green ﬁpronil shows the location of the upper anesthetic binding site (c). the blue
ﬁpronil is shown at the lower anesthetic binding site (d). the purple  xxxd2947xxx  molecule is seen
bound at the interface between the beta and  xxxg216xxx  m2 helices (e), and the orange alpha-endosulfan
shows one of the ligands bound at the central pore location, around the l9’ (l284) and t6’ (t281)
position.

base of tm bundle—within the tm subunit bundle
the highest ranked site (on average across the eight compounds but ranked
highest in six of them) was a site at the base of the tm bundle (figure 2b), in
contact with m2, but not in the pore. many m2 residues previously cited as being
important in insecticide binding (chen et al., 2006) make up the base-tm site,
in addition to residues from m1 and m3 helices (figures 2 and 3). this base-tm
site was found equally in the beta and alpha subunits. this largely hydrophobic site,
involving m2 residues v/t1 (v276), g4 ( xxxg279xxx ), t7 (t282), and v8 (v283),
has previously been implicated in stabilizing the m2 helix during gating (goren
et al., 2004). a ligand binding here could directly inﬂuence (restrict) the motion
of this important gating region of the pore-lining m2 helix, and therefore how
much the l9 (l284) residue blocks the channel. this site would be more open

figure 3. the alignment shows selected segments, and the whole transmembrane domain (tmd)
sequences, for the three subunits involved in this  xxxg830xxx (2)  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx (2) gamma 2 gabar model. the docking
encompassed the whole pentameric tmd as well as the lower part of the binding domain where
important ligand-binding domain (lbd)-tmd interactions take place, such as between the  xxxg836xxx - xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx ,
cys, and the m2m3 loops. the tm helices in the model are shown with the red boxes. the residues
involved in the ﬁve binding sites found are then indicated with the colored highlighting—using the
same color scheme for the sites as in figure 2. that is, the base-tm site residues are highlighted
red, the upper anesthetic binding site residues are highlighted green, the lower anesthetic binding
site residues are highlighted blue, the m2 interface residues are highlighted purple, and the central
pore residues are highlighted orange. the rdl mutant alanine position is marked with an arrow.

except that the f331 residue from m3 inserts into the cleft, and in fact the site
is more open in the alpha-subunit due to this position containing a valine residue
instead. v327 and t/f331 from m3 and n268 and s264 from m1 make up the
surrounding residues in the site. m2 is very well conserved across the subunits,
but m3 and m1 are less conserved and, therefore, present different residues
into the binding sites. this creates different orientations for bound ligands in
the sites. for instance, ebob binds parallel to the helical bundle in alpha but more

diagonally across it in the  xxxg217xxx . mutagenesis data for ebob indicates
either a base-tm or channel location for the binding site (hisano et al., 2007).
a common motif across the bound ligands is that there is a propensity for
phenyl-like rings to bind in the pocket adjacent to l284, interacting with v283,
t282 in m2 and v264 and l260 in m1.  xxxd2947xxx  has a strong preference for
the base-tm site.
in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes with the rdl (resistant to dieldrin)
mutation, there is a favored a302g/s mutation that provides some resistance
to dieldrin,  xxxd2947xxx , and bidn. the homologous human residue to the
mosquito a302 is a277. this residue is adjacent to v276, which helps deﬁne
the base-tm site. a mutation at a277 could explain a decreased binding afﬁnity
at the base-tm site for  xxxd2947xxx . both the beta and gamma form (lindane) of  xxxd2488xxx 
preferentially bound to the base-tm site. fipronil was the only compound to not
ﬁnd the base-tm site. fipronil is the largest of the ligands docked in this study
and simply did not ﬁt into this site. docking does not directly test accessibility
of a site, only whether a ligand will “ﬁt” in a site. however, visualizing the
structure shows that the site is not accessible from the intracellular side as
it would be blocked by the cytoplasmic domain between m3 and m4 and
is also partially blocked by the m1m2 loop. the ligand would either access
the site via the pore or through the subunit interface from the membrane.
also, rdl resistant gaba receptors have a decreased level of antagonism for
ﬁpronil (hosie et al., 1995), suggesting that ﬁpronil and  xxxd2947xxx  may bind
in different sites. the base-tm site, therefore, represents a site that is both
consistent with mutagenesis and pesticide resistance data for multiple ligands
(with the exclusion of ﬁpronil) and represents a possible location for allosteric
inhibition of the protein by not allowing m2 to rotate or translate out of the
pore in order to transition the channel from a closed/desensitized to an open
conformation.
“upper anesthetic” binding site
a large amount of evidence has shown that several residues that are at the top of
the tm bundle have been previously shown to be important in the binding and
action of anesthetic (belelli et al., 1999; olsen et al., 2004) and alcohol (mihic,
1999) molecules on the gabar. this area also presents the second highest
ranked site for binding of the ligands in this study and the highest ranked site
for ﬁpronil. this site is referred to here as the “upper anesthetic” binding site.
the “upper” distinction is because this cavity in the tm bundle is relatively
large and actually extends down closer to the center bundle transmembrane

716

r. j. law and f. c. lightstone

span. docking studies, though, appear to demonstrate two distinct binding sites
in this cavity, rather than one long site. the site closer to the center of the span
is therefore referred to as the “lower anesthetic” binding site although there
is little evidence that anesthetics actually bind here in the gabar. ligands
appear to bind at two distinct sites rather than at all points along the cavity.
the relatively open cleft in between the two sites, where ligands could enter
from the membrane, presents fewer vdw contacts, and therefore ligands split
into lower energy sites above and below the potential entry cleft. even so,
there are residues that are involved in both potential binding sites. residues
involved in the upper site are mostly in the m2m3 loop (residues 303 to 307)
and top of the m2 (l297, v300 & p/a301) and top of m3 (f/y308 and l/i310).
there are additional residues creating a hydrophobic enclosure to the site from
m1 (f246), the cys loop (f/y168), and an h-bond donor from the m1 linker
(k/n242). this m2m3 loop region has been previously shown to be very
important in interactions between the tm and ligand binding (lb) domains
during gating (bouzat et al., 2004; jung et al., 2005; lummis et al., 2005;
xiu et al., 2005) and was found to be altered in  xxxd2947xxx  binding to glycine
receptors (hawthorne & lynch, 2005), demonstrating a complex mechanism
of action that could involve this binding site. although the proline in m2m3
in nachr, implicated as being vital to gating (lummis et al., 2005), is not
conserved in the gabar, p301 at the top of m2 in gabar beta-subunits is
in position to perform the same role and would be inﬂuenced by a ligand
binding at the upper anesthetic binding cavity. residues in the m2m3 loop
make important contacts with residues in the cys loop and the beta1beta2 loop of
the lb domain. intriguingly, a tyrosine residue (y168) from the cys loop inserts
right into this area and is implicated by the docking as being directly involved
in binding at this site. no residues from the beta1beta2 loop are directly contacted by
docked ligands, but beta1beta2 sidechains, such as e77 and v78, do contact residues
that are shown to be important for binding here. it is quite surprising that a
relatively large ligand such as ﬁpronil should favor binding here, along with
small molecules such as anesthetics and alcohols, but it illustrates the potential
importance of the site in non-competitive allosteric modulation of channel
function.
“lower anesthetic” binding site
the lower half of the cleft that extends down from the putative anesthetic
binding site provides a distinct region for ligand binding that is the third highest
ranked site of the ﬁve sites found. residues at the top of this site are therefore

shared with residues at the base of the upper anesthetic binding site (e.g.,
 xxxd350xxx ), but no ligands appear to bind in an intermediate position. interestingly,
ﬁpronil does span the gap to the upper site when bound in the lower site. both
anesthetic sites are large enough to incorporate the large ﬁpronil ligand. the
other tm-bundle sites (base-tm and upper anesthetic) did not involve residues
in the m4 helix; but, the cavity at this location is more open, and residues from
m4 (a valine (15 on the m4) and a phenylalanine (f18 ), in the beta-subunit) are
involved in interactions with bound ligands. the majority of residues in this
site are in fact from m1 (t250, s254, i257) and m3 ( xxxd350xxx , f316, v317, and
a320). two residues in m2 are also important in interactions with the ligands
that bound at this site (n290,  xxxd1653xxx ). the common feature of these inner-bundle
binding sites is how a bound ligand would effectively increase the inter-helical
contacts and therefore potentially reduce ﬂexibility in that region and thereby
hinder the dynamic nature of the gating process.
m2 subunit interface site
one of the most intriguing sites found by the search protocol was a site whereby
the bound ligand bridged contacts between adjacent m2 helices (figure 2e).
residues in this region have been implicated in stabilization of the desensitized
state (findlay et al., 2001) and mutations here have been shown to dramatically
alter another cys-loop lgic channel, the  xxxg904xxx , to one which is
potentiated rather than inhibited by tbps binding (lynch et al., 1995). the
search dramatically favored the beta−alpha interface although a single incidence of the
gamma −beta interface was discovered by ﬁpronil. the subunits of the receptor are not
tightly packed together, hinting at the nature of the gating mechanism (cheng
et al., 2006), and ligands that could bind in the interface would disrupt the
relative rotations and breathing motions of the protein that would be necessary
for gating (grutter et al., 2005; mourot et al., 2006; sine & engel, 2006).
disrupting the motion of the m2 helices that line the pore would be the most
direct mechanism of allosterically altering the gating process. this site was
found by all the ligands other than  xxxd2488xxx . it is in the center of the m2
span—somewhat near the lower anesthetic binding site yet outside the bundle.
residues from adjacent m2 helices make up most of the site with half from
m2beta (t291, h292, r294, e295) and half from m2alpha (l285, s288, a289, s292).
residues from the m1 helix of the alpha-subunit also form the back of the binding
pocket (q245, t246, p249). endosulfan preferentially found this m2 interface
site. fipronil found the m2 interface site as its second most likely site. although
 xxxd2947xxx  preferred to bind to the base-tm and the anesthetic sites, it may be

possible that  xxxd2947xxx  binds at multiple sites. the e295 (m2beta) is the only
acidic residue in any of the binding sites and is more likely to salt-link to r294
(m2beta) or q245 (m1alpha) than to groups in the ligands although disturbing such
inter-subunit salt-links may be a very important mechanism related to ligands
binding at this site. mutations of the tm2 15 of glycine channels (homologous
to gabar t291) have altered the effectiveness of  xxxd2947xxx  (dibas et al.,
2002). this site is consistent with data for tbps and other bicyclophosphate
binders (maksay et al., 1994; dibas & dillon, 2000) and is likely to represent
the benzodiazepene binding site, speciﬁcally at the gamma −beta interface (berezhnoy
et al. 2004). ligands could either access this site through the gap between the
subunits, from the membrane, or possibly via the pore.

channel center pore blocking site
one of the sites found was in the center of the channel, around l9 -t6 ,
consistent with chen et al.’s result although a little higher in the channel
than they proposed (chen et al., 2006). neither a2 nor a1 appear to be
directly involved. the l9 -t6 region is the narrowest part of the pore, and the
leucines (l284) provide the hydrophobic girdle that is likely to be the gate that
blocks the passage of a hydrated cl− ion. these leucines provide the van der
waals (vdw) interactions necessary for these largely hydrophobic pesticides.
the hydroxyl groups of the threonines (t281) then provide hydrogen bonding
opportunities for the single polar groups that are exhibited in each of the ligands.
for instance, the sulphite group on alpha-endosulfan is hydrogen bonding to t281.
for each of the 5 out 8 ligands that found the pore center in the whole domain
search, all scored the binding energy as the lowest ranked of the sites found.
ebob, tbps, and  xxxd2488xxx  did not ﬁnd this inner pore location in the whole
tm domain search protocol.
in order to determine a binding energy to compare with the sites found, a
separate docking protocol was performed, focusing on just the channel center
site. this docking conﬁrmed both that this was a higher energy site for all of the
ligands, especially the two compounds that did not ﬁnd the site originally, and
also that the most favorable position in this area was in the pore constriction
site around l9 (l284) and not closer to the cytoplasmic mouth of the pore. in
50 runs, searching the pore only, only a single cluster was found in the pore for
 xxxd2488xxx  and lindane. the  xxxd2488xxx  and lindane compounds docked with the plane
of the ring parallel to the axis of the pore, just above the l9 constriction point
in the channel.  xxxd2488xxx  was unable to dock perpendicularly and/or lower down

in the channel, without undergoing energetically unfavorable rearrangements
of the small molecule structure, because of steric limitations. lindane, the
only  xxxd2488xxx  stereoisomer that is an active insecticide, also docked next to the l9
position but with a lower docked energy than  xxxd2488xxx . the difference in docking
energies for the  xxxd2488xxx  isomers is simply due to the shape of the molecules. the
arrangement of the chlorines in lindane (gamma - xxxd2488xxx ) makes a smaller ring and
more ball-like structure than the wider puckered ring of  xxxd2488xxx , therefore
allowing more contacts in this site, as well as in the base-tm site. this result is
completely consistent with lindane (gamma - xxxd2488xxx ) being the only  xxxd2488xxx  isomer that
demonstrates pesticide activity (willett et al., 1998), which has been shown to
mediate this affect via interaction with the gabar (vale et al., 1998), although
the other isomers are less quickly processed by organisms and accumulate much
more with potential long-term negative affects (konwick et al., 2006). even in
the pore-only search, the ebob compound continually favored clusters at the
subunit/m2 interfaces, rather than the pore center, although near pore center
modes were found. the elongated shape of the molecule allowed it to pack
up against one side of the channel, rather than symmetrically along the pore
axis. the butyl group is bent to best pack against the leucine (l9 ) sidechain
constriction site. of course, it would still be a pore blocker while bound in this
fashion.

conclusions
most of the compounds investigated in this study favored docking at a site
at the base of the tm bundle, between the 4 alpha-helices and in contact with
the m2 pore lining helix. these results may explain why residues highlighted
as being important in the binding of these insecticides are not all pore lining
residues. therefore these ﬁndings somewhat agree with the concept that there
might be a single binding site for some of these insecticide compounds (chen
et al., 2006) but suggest that this site is not in the pore. the exception would
be ﬁpronil, which appears too large to bind at this location. the results do
also propose the possibility that these insecticides might inﬂuence channel
gating by binding at four other potential binding sites, with the previously
proposed anesthetic binding site being the most favored alternative location.
for insecticides to inﬂuence channel gating from these sites they would be
acting as allosteric inhibitors by raising the energy barrier for the transition from
closed/desensitized states to an open conformation. from available knowledge
of the mechanism of the cys-loop lgics, the most direct way to do this would

be to prevent the breathing motion and rotation of the m2 helix out of the pore;
a model for which all of the binding sites are consistent. if the insecticides bind
in the pore, the lowest energy position appears to be at the narrowest point of
the channel, the proposed gating site (miyazawa et al., 2003), ﬂanked by the
m2 l9 (l284). other sites found include a site congruent with evidence for
anesthetic binding, here called the upper-anesthetic binding site, and a site that
constitutes an extension of that site down into the four helical bundle, therefore
called the lower anesthetic binding site. a site was also found at the subunit
interface, involving residues from m2 helices from both adjacent subunits.
stereoselectivity of gamma - xxxd2488xxx  (lindane) binding over  xxxd2488xxx  was seen for several
sites, notably the base-tm and pore center sites. in general, these results must
be compared to previous experimental results and also require validation by
future mutagenesis and labeling experiments. there is a possibility that residues
from m1 and m3 that also contribute to this binding site might demonstrate
an ability to alter the sensitivity or binding afﬁnity for these allosteric
affectors.
some mutagenesis evidence suggests a consolidation of insecticide
actions to a single pore location (chen et al., 2006). this study sheds new light
on the complex interplay between channel dynamics and inhibitor binding and
attempts to simplify and unite the wide array of available data for the chosen
insecticide compounds. however, mutation data is often difﬁcult to interpret
simply because of the dynamic, conformationally linked nature of proteins,
meaning that a mutation in one position can affect the protein’s structure and
function at a relatively distant site (sigworth, 1994). added to this, if the
functional channel activity of the mutant is not conﬁrmed, then there cannot
be full conﬁdence in the overall structure of the protein on which the ligand
binding is now being tested. one way to interpret the results of chen et al.
would be to say that of the 15 residues tested, only the mutation of t7 and t10
do not alter the m2 structure so much that they abolish the insecticide binding
site, as well as signiﬁcantly altering the function of the channel. non-speciﬁc
binding can be ruled out, but it is difﬁcult to determine exact stoichiometry.
binding of pesticides is likely to occur at multiple sites, but to the receptor
in different states (dibas et al., 2002) and result in a wide range of affects
(hawthorne & lynch, 2005). the receptor is a pentameric complex and may
contain multiple similar binding sites, or require two or more molecules to bind
at equivalent sites in multiple subunits, perhaps interfacial sites, much like the
agonist.

illustrated the complexity of action of these small molecules, but also the need to
describe multiple binding sites. the data collection enabled the conclusion that
there are two large sites of action corresponding to at least two distinct binding
sites (hosie et al., 2006); one so-called  xxxd2947xxx -site that would encapsulate
the base-tm, central pore, and lower-anesthetic sites, and a second site that
would be consistent with both the upper-anesthetic and m2-interface sites.

supplemental section
this supplemental section is intended to provide details on the binding sites
and docked orientations of the 8 ligands investigated in the 5 discovered sites
and to extend the general comments made in the main results section of the
article. not all of the ligands found all of the sites during the docking search
although every one of the potential binding sites was found by more than one
of the compounds. a summary of the energies of these positions are given in
table 1 in the main body of the article.

base-tm site
the highest ranked site was a site at the base of the tm bundle, in contact
with the pore lining m2 helix. one thing that the base-tm, upper and lower
anesthetic sites all have in common is that they involve residues from not just
m2 but also m1 and m3, as the ligand sits within the tm bundle (m4 is
less involved). in the case of many of the sites, the ligands did not appear to
select between the beta and alpha subunits. (in figure s1, the illustrations are for
the alpha-subunit base-tm site.) this site involves m2 residues t1 (t276), g4
( xxxg279xxx ), t7 (t282), and v8 (v283), as well as a proline from the m1m2 loop
(p273). v327 and t/f331 from m3 and n268 and s264 from m1 make up
the surrounding residues in the site. the main feature of the binding modes
in this site is the hydrophobic, van der waals packing of the small molecules
into the largely hydrophobic cavity within the protein. in this lowest energy
conformation, one of the  xxxd2947xxx  carbonyls forms a h-bond to the n268
sidechain, as does the ether region of ebob. tbps, lindane,  xxxd2488xxx  and
bidn bind like hydrophobic balls in a pocket. one of the nitrile groups from
bidn appears to interact with s331. lindane binds slightly lower in the pocket,
closer to t276, than  xxxd2488xxx —potentially a very important factor in the activity
of the molecule. the alpha-endosulfan ligand binds differently to the others as it
cannot completely ﬁt in the pocket. this explains its lower relative binding
energy for this site. it interacts with more residues in the m1m2 loop, as well
as n268. the docking runs do not show ﬁpronil to bind at the base-tm site, as
the molecule is too large to ﬁt into this site.

upper anesthetic binding site
binding at the upper anesthetic binding site involves mostly residues in the
m2m3 loop but also includes the completely conserved f246 residue from
m1, as well as residues from the interface of the ligand binding domain of
the receptor, such as k242 from the pre-m1-linker (to the binding domain),
cys loop residue. for consistency, the ﬁgures here (figure s2) are from the
alpha-subunit, but this site was found equally and with similar energies in both the alpha
and beta subunits. the exception is bidn, which only ﬁnds the upper anesthetic
site in the  xxxg218xxx , albeit with higher energy relative to most of the other
compounds bound in the alpha or beta subunits. bidn forms an interaction between
one of its nitriles and the s301 sidechain, which in the alpha and beta subunits either an
alanine or a proline, respectively. this may explain bidn’s preference, for this
subunit for this binding site. a carbonyl from  xxxd2947xxx  forms a h-bond with
the k/n242 sidechain but otherwise is enclosed in a hydrophobic box formed
residues from the top of m2, such l297, v300 and a301, m2m3 loop residues
(303 to 307), the top of m3 (f309 & i310) and f168 and f246. tbps, lindane,
 xxxd2488xxx , ebob, and bidn are simply enclosed in the hydrophobic pocket.
as with the base-tm site, the lindane ﬁlls the pocket more than the  xxxd2488xxx 
isomer and makes more contact with the pore lining m2 helix. fipronil, being
a larger molecule, extends out of the deﬁned pocket. it actually has more than
one mode of extending out of the pocket—either further down into the bundle
(as in figure s2) or out under the m2m3 loop toward the adjacent subunit, in a
similar orientation to the ebob mode shown here. the alpha-endosulfan molecule
did not ﬁnd this site.

lower anesthetic binding site (figure s3)
both the lower anesthetic binding site and the interfacial site are somewhat
consistent with the evidence for an “alternative”  xxxd2947xxx /ﬁpronil binding site
(kalueff, 2007) around the 15 position of m2 (t292). t292 is adjacent to the
n290 and l293 that extend from the m2 helix to interact with ligands bound in
the lower anesthetic site. other than these two m2 residues, multiple residues
from m3 ( xxxd350xxx , f316, v317, and a320) and m1 (t250, s254, and i257)
make up another largely hydrophobic binding pocket.  xxxd2947xxx  makes largely
hydrophobic interactions with the residues in the site. the other tm-bundle
sites (base-tm and upper anesthetic) did not extend out to involve the m4 helix
but the cavity at this location is more open and residues from m4 (a valine
(v15 ) and a phenylalanine (f18 ) in the beta-subunit) are involved in interactions

gaba receptor sites for insecticides

with bound ligands. for example,  xxxd2947xxx  has one of its carbonyl and alcohol
groups pointing out toward residues in the m4 segment. bidn binds in a very
similar way to  xxxd2947xxx , at this site, although it does not directly contact m2.
similarly, the lindane and tbps positions and orientations in this binding site
mean that they are not associated directly with m2. ebob completely spans
the binding site. fipronil partially spans the gap up through the helical bundle
and into the upper anesthetic site. the alpha-endosulfan only ﬁnds the site in the
alpha-subunit where it binds close to the m2 and does not contact residues in m4.
 xxxd2488xxx  does not ﬁnd this site.
m2 interface site
this site is equivalent to one that has also been suggested as a possible anesthetic
binding site (liu, 2004). such an interface exists between all the subunit pairs
in the receptor but the beta− xxxg216xxx  was by far the most commonly found, with
the lowest energies—other than for alpha-endosulfan, which only demonstrated
binding to alpha−gamma m2 interface. the images shown here (figure s4) illustrate the
site while looking at it from the channel. the site mainly involves residues from
two adjacent m2 helices, as residues from m1 of the  xxxg216xxx . in the beta−alpha site,
a large argenine sidechain from m2, r294, closes off the back of the site such
that no residues from the m3 of the beta-subunit are ever involved in interacting
with bound ligands. as with the other sites, the interactions with the ligand are
mostly hydrophobic van der waals interactions, with residues like l285 (m2alpha),
a289 (m2alpha), p249 (m1alpha), and the methyl groups of t263 (m2beta) and t246
(m1alpha). yet, there are several polar sidechains; s288 (m2alpha) appears to h-bond
to one of the  xxxd2947xxx  carbonyls, and s292 (m2alpha) interacts with the carbonyl
at the other end of this small molecule. h292 (m2beta) is only involved in ligand
interactions with molecules that dock to this site and protrude into the pore,
such as in the case of ﬁpronil. the e295 (m2beta) is the only acidic residue in
any of the binding sites and is more likely to salt-link to r294 (m2beta) or q245
(m1alpha) than to groups in the ligands although disturbing such inter-subunit
salt-links may be a very important mechanism related to ligands binding at
this site. lindane sits more deeply in the pocket than the other ligands and
makes entirely hydrophobic contacts with most of the hydrophobic moieties
just mentioned. the two nitrile groups from bidn interact with the backbone
of q245 (m1alpha) and the sidechain hydroxyl of s292 (m2alpha). the sulphite group
of alpha-endosulfan contacts the sidechain of n295 (m2alpha), which is a glutamate
residue in m2beta, and as endosulfan is only seen to bind this site at the alpha−gamma
border, rather than beta−alpha, could explain the ligand’s preference for this subunit

speciﬁc location, as well as the slightly increased size of the cavity. this is
endosulfan’s lowest energy binding site in the study. the orthogonal chlorine
of lindane points away from the argenine at the back of the pocket whereas
 xxxd2488xxx  would ﬁnd the equivalent atom interacting with r266—an unfavorable
interaction that may explain why  xxxd2488xxx  does not ﬁnd this site. tbps also
does not ﬁnd this site.
central pore site
the central pore represents one large potential binding pocket yet the ligands
in this study preferentially bound the pore at a single longitudinal location,
at the constriction point of the channel, composed of l284 (l9 ) and t281
(t6 ) providing h-bond donor moieties for the interacting ligands. the images
in figure s5 show the site as viewed from the intracellular side, near to the
mouth of the pore. for instance, alpha−endosulfan mostly packs within the ring
of leucines, but its sulphite group interacts with one of the threonine sidechain
hydroxyls, as does the sulfoxide group of ﬁpronil.  xxxd2947xxx  binds in a similar
fashion. the ether groups of ebob line up next to the threonine sidechains, as
do the oxygens in tbps. the larger ligands bind in the center of the channel,
completely blocking the pore and interacting with all ﬁve subunits. some of
the smaller ligands have a tendency to pack against one side of the pore, such
as lindane.  xxxd2488xxx  forms less van der waals contacts with the side of the
pore due its more disc-like shape, versus the ball-like structure of the gamma - xxxd2488xxx 
(lindane) isomer, with its orthogonal chlorine able to pack in between the
leucine sidechains.
