dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia are most
effectively managed by the liver, where most lipid
synthesis and lipoprotein catabolism takes place.
because hepatocytes extract approximately 50% of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) particles
from plasma, enhancement of hepatic  xxxg1318xxx 
activity is an effective method for lowering plasma
ldl-c levels. l
the statins (atorvastatin,  xxxd461xxx , fluvastatin, lovas
tatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin) target hepatocytes and
reduce cholesterol production by inhibiting 3hydroxy-3
methylglutarylcoenzyme a (hmgcoa) reductase. hmg
coa reductase is a ratecontrolling microsomal enzyme
that converts hmgcoa to mevalonic acid, a precursor of
cholesterol (figure 1). subsequent upregulation of hepatic
ldl receptors leads to increased removal of plasma ldlc, intermediatedensity lipoproteins (idl), and very-lowdensity lipoproteins (vldl).* statins also reduce production of hepatic  xxxg175xxx  and increase hepatic
 xxxg175xxx /e receptors.3  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitors are the most effective ldlc-lowering agents
available and the primary hypolipidemic drug treatment in

mechanisms

of action

two pharmacologic properties differentiate the 6
hmgcoa reductase inhibitors now available in the
united states. most-atorvastatin,  xxxd461xxx , fluvas
tatin, and pravastatin-are administered as active drug.
the other 2-lovastatin and simvastatin-are prodrugs
that must undergo hydrolysis to active hydroxy acid
forms in the liver.
it has been theorized that the method in which the
statins are created (ie, through “natural” fermentation or
synthetic means) may create a ditferent mechanism of
action.5 natural statins include lovastatin, pravastatin, and
simvastatin. synthetic statins are atorvastatin, cerhastatin,
and fluvastatin. regardless of their manufacturing process,
all stains are metabolized simikuly tbrough the liver, and
there is no convincing evidence that synthetically pro
duced statins are any less efficacious than natural statins,
as evidenced by angiographic studies that suggested sign@
icant slowing of atherosclerotic progression with both
atorvastatin and fluvastatin.6~7
there may be some variation in reductase inhibitory
activity. with the use of mevalonic acid levels as a marker,
a greater inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in patients
with heterozygous  xxxg1318xxx  was
observed with 80 mg/d atorvastatin than with either 40
mg/d pravastatin or 40 mg/d simvastatins after 6 weeks
of treatment, plasma levels of mevalonic acid were
reduced by 5!9%,32%, and 49%, respectively, and ldlc
levels were reduced by 54%, 35%, and 4394, respectively.

the reductions in mevalonicacid and ldl-c with atorvas
tatin were significantly (p i .004) greater than those
achieved with the other treatments. a longer inhibitory
effect was also observed with atorvastatin. this may
reflect the prolonged half-life of the  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitory action of atorvastatin (20 to 30 hour@; however, it may be due to the differences in dose efficacy.
in contrast to statins, other classes of hypolipidemic
drugs lower plasma lipids through indirect mechanisms.
bile acid sequestrants interrupt enterohepatic recycling
of bile acids, which stimulates bile acid synthesis from
cholesterol and upregulation of hepatic ldl receptors.
niacin may lower ldl-c by enhancing the hepatic
clearance of idl. niacin reduces triglyceride production
through transient inhibition of lipolysis, which reduces
free fatty acid concentration, decreases vldl transport,
and increases vldl clearance. *
liver specificity

all of the statins undergo first-pass hepatic extraction
(metabolism) and are thereby selectively distributed to
the liver. hepatic extraction (percentage of absorbed
dose) is 270% for fluvastatin and lovastatin, so% for
simvastatin, and 46% for pravastatin.lo hepatic extraction data are unavailable for  xxxd461xxx  and atorvastatin. it is thought that high hepatic extraction limits
the systemic availability of a statin and contact with
peripheral tissue, thereby minimizing the potential for
adverse effects.10 the majority of statins have low
absolute bioavailabilities: atorvastatin, 12%’ 1; pravastatin, 17%1*; fluvastatin, 20% to 30%13; simvastatin
(main metabolite), 5%1*; and lovastatin, 5%.15  xxxd461xxx  has a higher absolute bioavailability of 60%..16

high protein binding (195% for atorvastatin, fluvastatin,
lovastatin, simvastatin, and  xxxd461xxx ; 45% for pravastatin) may be responsible for reducing adverse
effects
on nonhepatic tissue.’ l-i6
numerous in vitro studies evaluated the relative selectivity of different statins for hepatic and peripheral tis
sues but produced disparate results, possibly because of
the differing methods or models used.l7,‘* it is important to realize that in vitro data do not take into account
the effects of first-pass metabolism and therefore cannot
fully represent or predict in vivo statin behavior. a correlation between hepatic selectivity and decreased incidence of adverse effects has not been demonstrated
clinically. for example, although pravastatin displays
greater experimental hepatic selectivity than atorvastatin or lovastatin, it does not have a clinically lower
incidence of side effects than any of the other statins.
however, because pravastatin is not metabolized by the
cytochrome p450 system, it may be less apt to sect the
dosing of other drugs.

hypercholesterolemic patients have confirmed the
greater relative ldl-c-reducing efficacy of atorvastatin.
in an &week, multicenter, open-label, comparative study
of 534 hypercholesterolemic patients, atorvastatin at
doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg daily produced signihcantly
greater (p i .ol) ldl-c reductions (-38%, -46%, -51%,
respectively) than milligram-equivalent daily doses of
simvastatin (-28%, -35%, -41%, respectively), pravastatin
(-19%, -24%, -34%, respectively), lovastatin (20 mg,
-29%;
40 mg, -31%) or fluvastatin (20 mg, -17%; 40 mg,
-23%).” three separate multicenter, double-blind, l-year,
comparative studies in patients with primary hypercho
lesterolemia found 10 to 20 mg/d atorvastatin to be significantly (p i .05) more effective in lowering ldl-c and
triglycerides than 20 to 40 mg/d lovastatin,*a 20 to 40
mg/d pravastatin,*t or 10 to 20 mg/d simvastatin.** on a
milligram-for-milligram basis, atorvastatin is twice as
potent as simvastatin, which is twice as potent as lovastatin. thus 10 mg atorvastatin, 20 mg simvastatin, and
40 mg lovastatin all lower ldl-c by approximately 35%,
as does 0.4 mg  xxxd461xxx .
all of the available statins reduce ldlc levels in a nonlinear dosedependent manner and are effective after
once-daily dosing.tast t the triglyceride-lowering efficacy
of statins appears to be proportional to their ldl-c-lowering efficacy.23 for instance, atorvastatin and simvastatin, which are more effective at the more commonly

triglycerides in hypercholesterolemic patients (table
i).24 in hypertriglyceridemic patients, triglyceride levels
are reduced by 29% and 40% with 40 mg and 80 mg simvastatin, respectively.23 and by 32% and 46% with 20 mg
and 80 mg atorvastatin, respectively.25  xxxd461xxx , the
newest hmgcoa reductase inhibitor to enter the market, has recently received approval to begin marketing a
higher dose: 0.4 mg. this dosage has been observed to
lower ldl-c levels by approximately 36%.26
as seen in a study of 662 patients with and without
coronary heart disease (cl-id),atorvastatin was shown to
be more effective (pi .ol) in achieving us national cho
 xxxd3014xxx  education program (ncep)27ldlc target goals
than simvastatin, lovastatin, or fluvastatin.** fifty-three
percent of atorvastatin-treated patients reached their
ncep ldlc goal at the starting dose of 10 mg. the hmg
coa reductase inhibitors studied were dispensed at their
market starting doses and increased in a stepwise manner. this study used the starting dose of 10 mg of simvastatin, however, rather than the currently recommended
starting dose of 20 mg. because the other statins are not
as potent as atorvastatin, higher doses are needed to
achieve comparable ljil-c reductions.
the use of statins in combination with fibrates or niacin
has demonstrated greater percentage reductions of

the marked cardiovascular and survival benefits
demonstrated by pravastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin (table ii) suggest that statins produce similar
outcomes provided that comparable ldl-c reductions
(25% to 35%) are attained. theoretically, greater ldlc reductions could produce proportionally better outcomes. it should be noted that no direct studies of the
impact of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, or  xxxd461xxx  on
reduction of cardiovascular events have yet been completed. the question of how low we should decrease
ldl-c is being addressed in the treat-to new targets
(tnt) study, which compares 10 mg versus 80 mg of
atorvastatin in patients with chd, and the study of
the effectiveness of additional reductions in cholesterol and homocysteine (search) trial, which compares 20 mg versus 80 mg of simvastatin. of note,

hypercholesterolemia triggers and facilitates key
events in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions at
lesion-prone arterial sites (figure 2). these include (1)
migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells and
macrophages in the arterial intima; (2) formation by
smooth muscle cells of a connective tissue matrix in
the subendothelial space; (3) influx and accumulation
of oxidatively modified ldl-c; and (4) uptake of modified ldl-c by macrophages to generate lipid-rich and
cholesteryl ester-rich foam cells.ssthe cytotoxic effects
of oxidized ldl-c on foam cells result in the formation
of an extracellular lipid core around which the atherosclerotic lesion develops.39 increased smooth muscle cell
migration to and proliferation in the intima and increased
collagen synthesis contribute to plaque enlargement and
potential vascular occlusiona
of statins

the most likely mechanisms by which statin-induced
ldl-c lowering reduces chd events are by slowing the
progression of atherosclerosis and preventing atheromatous lesion formation.4 reducing ldl-c appears to
shrink the lipid core and stabilize plaques, lessening the
risk of rupture, subsequent intraluminal thrombosis,
and coronary events.41 it is also possible that aggressive
ldl-c lowering may actually regress atherosclerotic
plaque, and this is currently under investigation.

effects

numerous angiographic, placebo-controlled studies
of hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary artery
disease demonstrated slowing of atherosclerotic progression after long-term statin therapy.** some of these
studies also showed substantial regression of atherosclerosis and significant prevention of new coronary
lesion formation. one study reported significant (p 2.05)
reductions in clinical cardiovascular events.43
the results of a recent meta-analysis of statin trials
indicate that the changes in percent diameter stenosis

correlate with percent reduction in ldl-c (p c .0005)
but not with the ldl-c level during treatment; furthermore, triglyceride reduction provides additional therapeutic benefit, and an ldl-c reduction of approximately 45% may be required to completely halt coronary
atherosclerosis progression.** these data suggest that
treatment should attempt to achieve maximum percentage reductions in ldl-c and that ncep target levels should be considered minimum goals.*’ the validity of this view and the cost-effectiveness of
aggressive ldl-c lowering are being examined in the
tnt and search trials.
effects on endothelial

function

statin-induced ldl-c lowering also is associated with
improved coronary artery endothelial function, which
could potentially lead to reduced vascular reactivity,
improved myocardial perfusion, and relief from ischemic
symptoms. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
of 23 hypercholesterolemic patients with symptomatic
coronary artery disease, a 26% reduction in ldl-c levels
produced by 40 mg/d lovastatin was accompanied by a
significant (p = .o13) improvement ln coronary endothelium-mediated vasodilator responses to acetylcholine in
minimally obstructed coronary arteries.*5 there was a
significant (p < .05) inverse correlation between ldl-c
level and endothelial response. in another trial, the
improvement in the coronary endotheliumdependent
vasodilator response to acetylcholine during lovastatin
plus  xxxd3014xxx  therapy was statistically greater than the
response to diet alone (p < .05) and not statistically
greater than the improvement with lovastatin plus
 xxxd1684xxx .46
other

antiatherogenic

mechanisms

statins appear to interfere with monocyte adhesion,
the earliest step in atherosclerotic lesion formation.
in vitro reduction of monocyte cd1 1b expression
and cd 11 b-dependent adhesiveness to endothelium
has been seen with lovastatin. additionally, simvastatin and lovastatin significantly reduced ex vivo

adhesion to endothelium of monocytes taken from
patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia (p < .oo1
vs healthy control patients).47 suppression of vascular
smooth muscle cell proliferation and/or migration may
be the result of reduced circulating oxidized ldl-c
secondary to statin-induced inhibition of ldl-c oxidationd* and/or reduced synthesis of cholesterol@ and
other mevalonate end products (eg, isoprenoid cholesterol precursors) that regulate cell division or proliferation.
thus far, there is no conclusive evidence that the
mechanisms summarized in table iii are independent
of ldl-c reductions. the observation of a significant
(p < .03) reduction in common carotid intima-media
thickness associated with a 28% to 33% ldl-c reduc. tion in patients with  xxxg1318xxx 
treated with pravastatin suggests that the effects on
arterial intimal hyperplasia observed in experimental
models may also be mediated by ldl-c reduction.50
plaque stabilization may provide another mechanism
for the reduction in clinical events observed with statin
use. ruptured plaques are often the catalyst for the
life-threatening thrombosis caused by acute episodes
of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden
coronary death.41 it appears that plaques most vulnerable to rupture are soft and lipid-rich, with a thin,
fibrous cap. it is unknown whether these possibly
antiatherogenic mechanisms are clinically significant,
reflect a selective direct action of statins, or contribute to reduced chd risk.

conclusions

3-methylglutorylcoenzyme

statins are selectively distributed to the liver, where
they directly inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. as a
result, ldl-c reduction is the predominant therapeutic effect. statins significantly reduce the incidence of
major coronary events as primary or secondary prevention therapy and are the only available lipid-lowering drugs shown to conclusively reduce total mortality rates in patients with chd. statins produce an
antiatherosclerotic
effect that correlates positively
with the percentage of ldl-c reduction. they also
may exert antiatherogenic effects unrelated to ldl-c
reduction. their hepatic extraction and low systemic
availability theoretically reduce drug exposure at peripheral tissue sites, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse
peripheral effects. during clinical use, the statins are
all well tolerated and have been shown to have similar safety profiles.
treatment with statins results in superior, clinically
beneficial ldl-c lowering with a low risk of adverse
effects. there now exists a wide selection of efficacious
 xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors to effectively treat the
broadest possible range of hypercholesterolemic patients
with the goal of helping many more patients to. achieve
target ncrp ldlc goals.
