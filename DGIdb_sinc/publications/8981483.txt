abstract

we describe the use of sr141716a, a central cannabinoid antagonist, in radioligand binding and adenylyl cyclase (ac) inhibition
studies in rat cerebella membranes. the binding of [3h]sri41716a was dose-dependent and saturable, with kd and bnl~ of 0.61 _+0.12
nm and 1752 + 294 fmol/mg protein, respectively. kinetic analysis of [3h]sr141716a binding afforded a kd of 0.72 nm. in addition
[3h]sri41716a was displaced dose-dependently by unlabelled sr141716a yielding a pki of 8.37 _+0.07. cannabinoid receptor
agonists displaced [3h]sr141716a in a dose-dependent manner, (pki) nabilone (8.29 + 0.08), win 55,212-2 (7.75 _+0.15), a~-tetrahydrocannabinol (7.29 _+0.2 l), a8-tetrahydrocannabinol (6,53 _+0.09) and anandamide (5.92 _+0.04). the affinity of anandamide was
increased (6.26 + 0.13) by co-incubation with a  xxxg745xxx  inhibitor. a range of 13 commonly used non-cannabinoid ligands
included at 100/~m were unable to displace [3h]sri41716a. win 55,212-2 inhibited basal camp formation dose-dependently with a
pics0 of 7 61 +_0.12 (24.3 nm) in an sr141716a (1 /zm) reversible manner. copyroght © 1996 elsevier science ireland ltd.

both central (cbi) and peripheral (cb2) cannabinoid
receptors have been cloned and sequenced, and possess the
predicted seven transmembrane structural motif common
to guanine nucleotide binding protein (g) coupled receptors [14,15], cannabinoid receptors inhibit adenylyl
cyclase [4,10], close voltage sensitive ca z+ channels
[2,4,13] and stimulate an outward k + channel conductance
[4] via a pertussis toxin sensitive g-protein. despite rapid
advances in our understanding of cannabinoid receptor
structure, function and distribution, these studies have
been hampered by the lack of a high affinity antagonist.
rinaldi-carmona et al. [18,19] recently introduced a
highly potent cb 1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist sri41716a ((n-(piperidin-l-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl- 1h- xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxamide hydrochloride) which is now available as a radioligand. we report the use of sr141716a in radioligand
binding and functional studies in order to characterise

cb1 receptors in membranes prepared from rat cerebellum, an area with a high cb 1 receptor density [7,111.
female wistar rats (250-300 g) were killed by cervical
dislocation, the brain rapidly transferred to ice-cold bufl%r
(tris-hcl, 50 ram, ph 7.4) and the cerebellum removed.
cerebella were homogenised on ice using a tissue tearor
(setting 5). the homogenate was centrifuged at 13500
rev./min for 10 rain at 4°c (heraeus biofuge 28rs). the
supernatant was discarded, the pellet resuspended and recentrifuged. typically one cerebellum was finally resuspended in 20 ml of assay buffer. membranes were prepared fresh each day as we have noted poor reproducibility with frozen-thawed membranes.
all binding experiments were performed at 30°c [5] in
500/a volumes of tris-hc1 (50 mm), ph 7.4 for 60 rain
using approximately 200 ~g of membrane protein, measured according to lowry [12]. in order to determine the
kd kinetically, the association rate (k+ ~) was estimated by
incubating membranes with 0.4 nm [3h]sr141716a to
equilibrium. dissociation was initiated by the addition of
1 /zm sr141716a to estimate the dissociation rate (k_~).
all binding studies were performed in disposable glass

tubes (fisons, loughborough, uk) pretreated with sigmacote® (sigma chemical co. ltd., poole, uk), and allowed
to dry, in order to reduce non-specific binding. in saturation studies increasing concentrations (0.01-5.3 nm) of
[3h]sr141716a (specific activity 40 ci/mmol, radiochemical purity 98.6%; amersham int., bucks, uk) were
used. in competition studies a fixed concentration of
approximately 0.4 nm was used. non-specific binding
was defined in the presence of 1 tzm (from a 5 mm
stock in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)) unlabelled
sr141716a (a gift from sanofi, montpellier, france;
batch purity 100%). stock concentrations of anandamide,
a9-tetrahydrocannabinol, as-tetrahydrocannabinol were
supplied (semat, st. albans, uk) in ethanol  xxxd1891xxx  mg/
ml; win 55,212-2 mesylate was supplied (semat, st.
albans, uk) as a powder and made in dmso at 5 mm.
nabilone (lot 94h047) was a kind gift from eli lilly
(basingstoke, uk) and prepared as a 5 mm stock in
dmso. dmso and ethanol concentrations in the assay
never exceeded 0.02 and 0.2% respectively and were
always included in the appropriate controls. in addition,
the effects of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf; 1
mm) on the binding of anandamide was examined. due
to instability in aqueous media, pmsf was added directly
from an isopropanol stock solution prior to incubation.
bound and free radioligand were separated by rapid
vacuum filtration using a brandel cell harvester. the
wash buffer was tris-hc1 (50 mm), containing bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (bsa; 2 g/l), ph 7.4. in addition, harvester

papers (whatman gf/b) were soaked in polyethyleneimine (0.5%) and loaded onto the harvester wet. this procedure is essential to reduce non-specific binding. filters
were extracted with optiphase safe (whatman, uk) overnight prior to assessing bound radioligand.
for the measurement of camp formation, membranes
(~200/~g) were prepared and washed as described above,
and incubated in nominally ca2+-free atp regenerating
buffer (300 #1, ph 7.4 at 37°c) with the following composition (mm): atp (0.5), phosphocreatine (10), gtp (0.1),
tris-hc1 (50), mg 2÷ (3), l-isobutyl-4-methylxanthine
( xxxd2388xxx ; 0.5) creatine kinase (30 eu/ml) and bsa (0.1%)
[9]. after 15 min at 37°c the reaction was terminated by
the addition of 20 #1 hc1 (10 m). the ph was equilibrated
by the addition of 20/zl naoh (10 m) and 180/zl trishc1 (ph 7.4, 1 m). following centrifugation (13 000 rev./
min for 2 min in a sarstedt microfuge), camp was measured in the supernatant by a radio-receptor assay [ 1] using
a binding protein from bovine adrenal cortex.
data are presented as the mean + sem (n, independent
experiments) for single or duplicate determinations.
saturation isotherms were analysed using graphpadprism, according to the langmuir-hill function to yield
the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and maximum
binding capacity (bmax).in addition the ks has been determined kinetically by calculating the ratio of k - 1/k÷i.
ic50 values and slope factors were obtained by computer
assisted curve fitting (graphpad-prism) and corrected
for the competing mass of [3h]sr141716a, l to yield ki
values using the cheng-plusoff equation [3].
the binding of [3h]sr 141716a to cerebella membranes
was dose-dependent and saturable (fig. 1), yielding a kd
and bmaxof 0.61 + 0.12 nm and 1752 + 294 fmol/mg protein, respectively (n = 7), (fig. 1, inset). at approximately
0.4 nm [3h]sr141716a the specific binding amounted to
71.1 + 1.5% (n = 11) of the total binding. kinetic determination of kd (k_] = 1.57 m i n - 1/k+l = 2.17 nm -1
min -l) yielded a value of 0.72 nm. the binding of
[3h]sr141716a (0.4 nm) was displaced dose-dependently by sr141716a, with apki of 8.37 + 0.07, (table 1).
a range of ligands that interact with the cannabinoid
receptor produced dose-dependent displacement of
[3h]sr141716a binding, with pki values and slope

55,212-2
(fig.
2a) 2 a9-tetrahydrocannabinol
> ax-tetrahydrocannabino1 > anandamide.
the affinity for anandamide
was
increased by co-incubation with pmsf (1 mm), a protease
inhibitor [8], (table 1). a range of commonly used noncannabinoid ligands (naloxone, acetylcholine, dopamine,
noradrenaline,
gaba, glutamate, atp, hydrocortisone.
 xxxd2482xxx  and atropine) all included at 100 pm concentrations produced less than 22% (data not shown) displacement of [‘h]sr141716a.
win 55,212-2 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of
basal camp formation with a pic5(,, of 7.6 1 + 0.12 (24.3
nm; fig. 2). the response to 3 pm win55,212-2
(36.4 f 4.6% inhibition) was reversed by co-incubation
with 1 pm sr141716a (3.2 + 3.2% inhibition).
in addition, carbachol (10 ,um. as an internal positive
control)
also inhibited
basal camp formation
by
53.8 f 10.1% which was reversed by co-incubation
with
1 pm atropine (3 4 +_3.3% inhibition).
we report here the use, in cerebella membranes, of a
antagonist
cbl
selective
cannabinoid
receptor
sr141716a. the binding of radiolabeled sr141716a is
time- and dose-dependent,
saturable, and displays relatively high affinity. the kd/ki of 0.6-4.2 nm compares
favourably with the figure of 1.98 nm (k,) in rat brain
and 5.6 nm (kj in cho cells expressing cbl receptors
quoted by rinaldi-carmona
et al. [ 191 in displacement
studies using [‘h]cp55,940 as the radioligand.
in two
very recent reports
in cerebellum
the affinity
of
[3h]sr141716a has been confirmed as -0.6 nm [ 17,201.
cbl receptor density (b,,,) is relatively large but compares favourably with other reports [5,6.8,1 i]. the specificity of [‘h]sr141716a for the cannabinoid receptor is
confirmed by the inability of a range of non-cannabinoid
ligands to displace [‘h]sr141716a
binding. the cbi
receptor, in membrane preparations, remains coupled to
an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (4. io, 161 and the ic5(i
(24 nm) is similar to the ki (1x nm) for binding displacement suggesting a tight coupling of the  xxxg479xxx  to adenylyl cyclase in cerebellar membranes.
