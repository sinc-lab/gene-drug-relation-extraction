abstract
background and purpose:  xxxd2182xxx , gv150526, is a selective antagonist at the glycine site of the n-methyl-daspartate receptor. the safety and efficacy of gv150526
were studied in two phase iii randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute ischemic stroke patients
within 6 h from onset [the glycine antagonist in neuroprotection (gain) international and gain americas trials]. a planned mri substudy within these trials investigated the effect of  xxxd2182xxx  on infarct volume. methods:
patients enrolled in the gain trials at designated mri
substudy sites were eligible if they had a pretreatment
acute cortical lesion on diffusion-weighted mri of at
least 1.5 cm diameter or 5 cm3. final lesion assessment
was performed on t2-weighted mri at month 3. blinded

image analysis was performed centrally. the primary hypothesis was that  xxxd2182xxx  would attenuate lesion
growth from baseline relative to placebo. results: a total
of 106 patients were eligible, 75 (34  xxxd2182xxx , 41 placebo) of whom had month 3 scans (primary analysis
population). no effects of  xxxd2182xxx  on infarct volume
were observed in the primary or other analyses. however, significant associations of lesion volume to clinical
severity and outcomes were observed. ischemic lesion
volume decrease was predictive of substantial clinical
improvement. conclusion: consistent with the clinical
outcomes in the gain trials, no effects of  xxxd2182xxx  on
ischemic infarction was observed. concordance of results of the clinical outcome trials with those of this infarct volume substudy as well the associations of infarct
volume to clinical outcomes further support the potential
role of infarct volume as a marker of outcome in dose
finding and proof of principle acute stroke trials.

many antagonists of the n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptor have shown neuroprotective effects in
animals, but none has demonstrated beneﬁt in clinical
trials of acute stroke patients [1]. the possible reasons
that neuroprotective success in animal models has not
translated to positive clinical trials and strategies that
may improve clinical development have been discussed
extensively elsewhere [2–4]. in animal models, a necessary requirement for advancement to clinical trials is a
beneﬁcial effect of the drug in reducing infarct volume
relative to controls. a common limitation of neuroprotective development has been reliance on only safety (by
identiﬁcation of maximum tolerated dose) as the decisive
factor in proceeding from phase ii to phase iii trials; evidence of target biological drug effects, e.g., infarct volume reduction, at safe doses or any central nervous system effect that would conﬁrm adequate brain penetration
has not been a requirement. one approach that has been
advocated to improve stroke drug development has been
the use of imaging markers of ischemic pathology as tools
for selecting patients and measuring drug effects [5].
the hypothesized utilities of mri with diffusion
(dwi) and perfusion (pwi) in ischemic stroke clinical
trials are threefold: (1) selection: pretreatment imaging to
conﬁrm the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and select
the optimal target population based on ischemic pathology; (2) proof of principle: outcome measurements in
phase ii trials aimed at replicating the preclinical effects
of the drug on infarct volume or otherwise demonstrating
the target pharmacological response, or (3) outcome measures in phase iii trials providing conﬁrmatory evidence
of a clinical beneﬁt. although there is no consensus in the
choice of clinical outcomes in neuroprotective stroke trials [2, 3, 6], the degree of disability is a more clinically
relevant outcome variable than death, although less reliably measured. outcomes on stroke clinical outcome
scales will depend on many factors, including infarct location, patient age and comorbidities, as well as individual investigator judgment. sample size estimates for
stroke neuroprotective trials using clinical outcome scales
may range from 500 to 1,350 subjects per group [7–11].
infarct volume is a direct measure of the ﬁnal pathological step that mediates the clinical deﬁcits caused by stroke
and therefore has been hypothesized to be a more powerful and more reliable measure of relevant drug effects
than outcomes measured by clinical disability scales [5,
12]. this hypothesis has been supported by data from
natural history series and prior clinical trials.
preliminary data indicate that the ischemic lesion volume measurements by dwi acutely and t2-weighted im-

study design
the mri substudy design paralleled that of the gain americas
and gain international clinical outcome studies, from which substudy patients were recruited [7, 10] it was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a single-dose regimen of  xxxd2182xxx  in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic
stroke. patients in the clinical outcome studies were randomized
on a 1:1 basis to receive either  xxxd2182xxx  or placebo by intravenous
infusion within 6 h of symptom onset. the full design, eligibility
criteria and patient characteristics have been described elsewhere
[7, 10].
the substudy was performed in 48 centers in 9 countries. sites
were selected based on demonstrated competence in performing
diffusion and perfusion mri of acute stroke. patients meeting eligibility and consenting to the clinical outcome studies were screened
and scanned for eligibility for the mri substudy. randomization
into the clinical outcome studies was not dependent on results of
the screening baseline mri or inclusion in the substudy. in an ef-

aging (t2wi) chronically are predictive of the clinical
status of patients at acute or chronic times, and of patient
outcome [12–15]. two acute stroke trials of citicoline
used mri to select and evaluate patients by ischemic lesion location and size. the ﬁrst trial found a trend toward
a reduction in lesion volume growth with active therapy
(180 to 34%) and estimated that a sample size of 58 per
arm would have had sufﬁcient power to show signiﬁcance
[13]. the second citicoline mri trial was a substudy of a
larger clinical trial and demonstrated signiﬁcant lesion
volume reductions with citicoline treatment in approximately 70 patients per arm [16], an order of magnitude
fewer subjects than required to demonstrate beneﬁts on
clinical outcome scales [17].
 xxxd2182xxx , gv150526, is a selective antagonist at the
glycine site of the nmda receptor, which reduces infarct
volume in experimental stroke models [18]. phase ii dose
escalation and safety clinical trials [19] conﬁrmed the
safety of a dose that was tested in the glycine antagonist
in neuroprotection (gain) international and gain
americas phase iii clinical trials [7, 10], randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute ischemic stroke patients within 6 h from onset. no clinical beneﬁt of  xxxd2182xxx  was observed in the gain clinical trials. a prospective mri substudy was undertaken, however. the
primary aim of this substudy was to investigate the treatment effect of  xxxd2182xxx  on ischemic lesion size, as evidenced by a reduction in ischemic lesion volume growth
in patients treated with  xxxd2182xxx  relative to those treated
with placebo. the secondary objective was to investigate
the relationship of lesion volumes to clinical outcomes.

fort to save time within the 6-hour window, sites obtained the baseline mri at the same time they were making the call for randomization and subsequently reconstituting the study drug. however,
the baseline mri had to be obtained prior to the administration of
the study drug. thus, treatment was initiated upon completion of
the scan and did not require interpretation of the scan.
mri scans were obtained at baseline and at month 3. all were
performed on 1.5-tesla standard clinical scanners from 4 manufacturers permitting single shot echo-planar imaging. pulse sequence
parameters were standardized to be equivalent across scanner
models.
acute ischemic lesion was assessed on dwi, using 20 contiguous 7 mm thick slices. the dwi was acquired using b-values at
1,000 and 0 s/mm2. pwi was performed as multi-slice gradient
echo echo-planar imaging using the bolus tracking method with
0.1 mmol/kg  xxxd2171xxx  injected manually or by power injector at a rate of 5 ml/s. baseline scans also included t2*-weighted
images for hemorrhage detection and mr angiography for depiction of vascular pathology. at month 3 (83 days) dwi was also
obtained.
all mri data were sent to the mri core laboratory, where image analysis and quantiﬁcation were performed. all lesion volumes
were measured by an expert reader who was blinded to both the
patient’s treatment assignment and clinical characteristics. lesion
volumes were measured by the planimetric method using commercial software (cheshire) that permitted semi-automated segmentation followed by user editing of region boundaries. the dwi isotropic b = 1,000 images were used to assess the lesion volume at
baseline and the dwi b = 0 images (equivalent of the t2wi) were
used to assess lesion volume at month 3. the abnormal perfusion
volume was determined as the region that showed a delay (relative
hyperintensity) in the relative mean transit time (mtt) maps calculated from the raw pwi images at the mri core laboratory.
a patient was eligible for inclusion if the acute ischemic lesion
involving the cerebral cortex on dwi was 11.5 cm in diameter or
15 ml in volume. patients were excluded if there were lesions or
artifacts that interfered with image assessments or if acute intracerebral hemorrhage was present. an interpretation of the baseline
mri for eligibility was made by the investigator at the site, but deﬁnitive eligibility for the mri substudy analysis was determined
by the mri core laboratory.
sample size determinations
the sample size estimations for this substudy were based on
data from a small phase ii mri substudy [19]. based on these data,
a sample size of 44 in each treatment group would provide 80%
power to detect a 50% relative difference in the growth of ischemic
lesion volume with an  of 0.05 using a two-sided test.
all mri substudy patients that had two evaluable time points
(baseline and month 3) were included in the ‘as treated’ primary
analysis. any patient that had a baseline mri but no follow-up
mri (either due to death or lost to follow-up) was excluded from
the primary analysis.
primary substudy analysis
a nonparametric analysis of covariance was used for the primary mri substudy analysis. ischemic lesion volume and national institutes of health stroke scale (nihss) score at baseline were
used as covariates. an ordinary least-squares regression was ﬁt to
the log-transformed ischemic lesion volume at month 3 and nihss

108

cerebrovasc dis 2006;21:106–111

score at baseline. a cochran-mantel-haenszel correlation statistic
was calculated on the ranks of the residuals from the least-squares
regression line.
other analyses
a secondary analysis included the baseline hypoperfusion volume (as measured by the mtt map) as a covariate. for this analysis, the same nonparametric analysis of covariance was used as
described for the primary analysis. however, in addition to ischemic lesion volume and nihss score at baseline, the hypoperfusion
volume was used as a covariate.
another secondary analysis included mri substudy patients
with missing values secondary to death due to stroke. an ordinary
least-squares regression was ﬁt to the rank of ischemic lesion volume at month 3 as a function of the ranks of ischemic lesion volume
and nihss score at baseline. the lowest rank was assigned to patients who did not have ischemic lesion data at month 3 due to
death. a cochran-mantel-haenszel correlation statistic was calculated on the residuals from the least-squares regression line.
descriptive statistics on lesion size, percent diffusion perfusion
mismatch (100! (mtt volume – dwi volume)/dwi volume) and
volume change were tabulated within and across treatment groups.
spearman rank correlations were calculated to investigate the relationship of lesion volume to scores on clinical scales. in a post hoc
analysis, the association of a decrease in lesion volume with an improvement in the national institutes of health stroke scale
(nihss) of 7 or more points, which had been observed in another
study [13], was assessed by a 2 test.

results

of 2,171 subjects that were enrolled in the gain clinical outcome studies, 390 were enrolled at mri substudy
centers, 181 (46%) of whom were screened with mri prior to 6 h of stroke onset. of those, 106 (57 placebo, 48  xxxd2182xxx ) qualiﬁed for the mri substudy based on acute
ischemic lesion size and location. seventy-one percent,
75/106 had month 3 scans (primary analysis population);
41 treated with placebo, 34 treated with  xxxd2182xxx . of the
31 patients excluded from the primary analysis, 25 (24%)
died, and 6 (5%) refused follow-up or had technically unusable data. of the 106 substudy patients, pwi scans
were obtained in 100 cases, 95 of which were technically
adequate for analysis. for the primary analysis population there were 67 usable baseline pwi scans. the median time from stroke onset to start of the mri scan was
4.4 h, the median duration of the mri scanning session
was 0.5 h and the median time from the completion of
the mri to the initiation of treatment was 0.5 h. the median time from stroke onset to treatment was 5.7 h.
of the 209 patients at substudy sites who did not undergo mri, the reasons for not obtaining the scan were
reported by the investigator to be patient related (e.g.,

patient baseline characteristics were not signiﬁcantly
different between the treatment groups and representative of those in the clinical outcome study [7, 10] samples
from which they came. median nihss was 15 in either
group at baseline. lesion volumes did not differ between
the groups at baseline and at month 3 (tables 1, 2). there
was no signiﬁcant effect of  xxxd2182xxx  on infarct volume
in primary and secondary analyses of covariance for the
effect of  xxxd2182xxx  on infarct volume. no signiﬁcant difference was found on clinical outcome measures at month
3 (nihss, barthel index, modiﬁed rankin score, mortality) in this substudy sample. of the 67 adequate pwi
scans, 64 (96%) had perfusion defects on mtt and in 50
(75%) of these cases the volume of the hypoperfusion region exceeded the ischemic lesion on dwi (diffusion-perfusion mismatch) by 20%. patients with diffusion-perfusion mismatch at baseline had a median 27.8% increase
in lesion volume, whereas those without a mismatch had
a median decrease of –12.9%, indicative of greater lesion
growth in patients with mismatch (p = 0.05).
the correlations between lesion volumes and clinical
severity are listed in table 3. moderate but signiﬁcant correlations were observed between nihss and lesion volume at baseline and between month 3 lesion volume and
the month 3 clinical outcomes.
in the total sample, there was a signiﬁcant relationship
between lesion volume decrease and an nihss improvement by 7 or more points (p ! 0.0001; 2 = 13.37; table 4).
the positive predictive value of a lesion volume decrease
predicting clinical improvement was 83%.

discussion

these mri substudy results do not support a neuroprotective effect of  xxxd2182xxx  in any of the analyses, and
are thus concordant with the neutral clinical outcomes
previously reported for the  xxxd2182xxx  clinical outcome
studies [7, 10]. the reasons that preclinical reductions in
infarct volume of gavistenel in preclinical models have
not been demonstrable in humans are not known. excessive times to treatment, subtherapeutic doses, limitations
of preclinical models to predict clinical response, need to
combine neuroprotection with reperfusion therapy, or
the possibility that the drug is not neuroprotective in humans cannot be ruled out. such uncertainties stress the
potential value of phase ii demonstration of the target
biologic effects as the basis of decisions to proceed to
phase iii trials.
this is the ﬁrst multicenter acute stroke trial with a 6hour time window to use dwi and pwi as a pretreatment
assessment, and thus supports the feasibility of performing mri as a baseline screening exam in acute stroke trials. many centers can rapidly access mri during a time
critical in acute stroke, although they may add time to the
pre-treatment screening of patients and may delay the
initiation of experimental therapy for an average of
30 min if both ct and mri are performed prior to initiation of treatment.
mri with dwi and pwi is an appealing imaging modality for stroke since it provides pre-treatment angiography, perfusion, and lesion volume information during a
brief, noninvasive assessment. it has been proposed that
positive imaging diagnoses would improve patient selection toward the goal of a more optimal target sample for
stroke and that the change in lesion volume could serve
as a marker for clinical outcome [3]. the additional biologic homogeneity of imaging-based selection will limit
the proportion of eligible patients and thereby recruitment rate, and the need for an imaging outcome risks loss
to follow-up due to death, a potential source of bias. earlier times for follow-up imaging prior to hospital discharge may reduce this loss to follow-up. nonetheless, the
study has demonstrated that within a 6-hour window
trial, enrollment on the order of 100 patients is achievable.
these results support the role of lesion volume change
measured by mri as a marker of clinical outcome in
stroke trials. the correlations of clinical scales to lesion
volumes replicate prior observations and conﬁrm that
mri measures in the present study performed as expected [12–15]. the relationship of a decrease in lesion vol-

110

cerebrovasc dis 2006;21:106–111

ume to clinical improvement over the 3-month period of
observation in this trial replicates the same relationship
observed in two other stroke trials with a 24-hour treatment time window [13, 16].
the present sample also conﬁrms that lesion growth is
greater in patients with a diffusion-perfusion mismatch
and supports the hypothesis that mismatch may identify
the optimal patient in whom to demonstrate a beneﬁcial
effect in lesion growth clinical trials [12, 13, 20–24]. recent results have given more direct support. the  xxxd1848xxx  in acute stroke trial, a randomized control
trial of a thrombolytic drug up to 9 h after stroke onset
and selecting only patients with a diffusion-perfusion
mismatch, found signiﬁcant beneﬁt on both the target
imaging outcome, early reperfusion, and 90-day clinical
outcome [25].
dwi and pwi are a more direct and objective measure
of ischemic pathology than clinical rating scales, and may
provide a direct measure of tissue salvage in stroke therapy. mri not only has a role in identifying and verifying
acute ischemic pathology, but it can be a powerful tool in
proof of principle phase ii dose selection clinical trials by
providing evidence of target physiological response in
sample sizes too small to demonstrate clinical beneﬁts.
although reduction of infarct volume is considered a necessary condition mediating therapeutic neuroprotection
in stroke, it is not sufﬁcient to conclude efﬁcacy in stroke
patients. a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in lesion volume could be too small to translate into a clinically signiﬁcant beneﬁt, or toxicity could negate clinical beneﬁts
attributable to smaller infarcts. infarct reduction, while
evidencing the target biological effect of neuroprotective
therapy, must also be accompanied by clinical beneﬁts to
claim efﬁcacy for a drug. the hypothesis that mri measurements of ischemic pathology may be a surrogate
marker for clinical beneﬁts at phase iii will require validation from future clinical trials that ﬁnd concordance of
clinical and imaging outcome with both effective and ineffective therapies.
