abstract:

 xxxd3417xxx  exerts many of its biological effects by interaction with heterocomplexes of
nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars) and retinoid x receptors (rxrs). to further examine this interaction,
a  xxxg1073xxx  (gst) fusion protein containing the ligand binding domain of human rxrr
has been used to copurify the ligand binding domain of human rargamma by affinity chromatography over
glutathione-agarose. complexes of recombinant rar-rxr ligand binding domains retaining full ligand
binding capacity were purified, and their interactions with various retinoids were characterized by
fluorometric titration and photoaffinity labeling. analyses of the distribution of limiting amounts of [3h] xxxd3417xxx  between cytoplasmic  xxxd3417xxx  binding proteins,  xxxg1938xxx  and  xxxg512xxx , and
the purified heterocomplexes indicate that  xxxd3417xxx  binds with comparable affinity to  xxxg1938xxx 
and the heterocomplexes, but with approximately 10-fold less affinity to  xxxg512xxx . the aromatic retinoid
 xxxd71xxx , which is used in the treatment of psoriasis, binds relatively poorly to the purified heterocomplexes,
although it binds with high affinity to the crabps.  xxxd71xxx  displaces [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  from
the crabps and increases  xxxd3417xxx  occupancy of the heterocomplexes. these results suggest that
certain retinoids could potentially perturb the distribution of endogenous  xxxd3417xxx  between the crabps
and the nuclear receptors and thus affect retinoid signaling. the purified recombinant complexes should
provide a useful model system for further structural analysis of the dimerization interface between the
rar and rxr ligand binding domains.

 xxxd3417xxx , as well as a number of its synthetic analogs,
has profound effects on growth and differentiation and is
used for the treatment of severe dermatological diseases and
certain malignancies (goodman, 1994; hong & itri, 1994;
peck & digiovanna, 1994). the  xxxd3417xxx  receptors
(rars)1 and retinoid x receptors (rxrs) are  xxxd3417xxx 
dependent transcriptional regulators which mediate many of
the biological effects observed with administration of vitamin
a (mangelsdorf & evans, 1995). the rars (petkovich et
al., 1987; giguère et al., 1987) bind both 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx 
and  xxxd3417xxx , while the rxrs (hamada et al.,
1989; mangelsdorf et al., 1990, 1992; leid et al., 1992) bind
only 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  (heyman et al., 1992; levin et al.,
1992). the  xxxd3417xxx  occupancy of the rars
may be modulated by two cytoplasmic proteins, cellular
 xxxd3417xxx  binding protein-i ( xxxg1938xxx ) and cellular

 xxxd3417xxx  binding protein-ii ( xxxg512xxx ) (li & norris,
1996). these proteins also bind  xxxd3417xxx  with
high affinity and have been proposed to limit nuclear levels
of  xxxd3417xxx  by sequestration and/or promotion
of  xxxd3417xxx  metabolism (fiorella & napoli,
1994; boylan & gudas, 1991, 1992).
the rxrs bind as homodimers or higher order oligomers
to dna response elements consisting of directly repeating
hexamer purine-g(g/t)tca sequences separated by one
base pair. the rars bind as heterodimers with rxr to
dna response elements that consist of direct repeats
separated by one, two, or five base pairs. the rars and
rxrs are approximately 50 kda in size and display a similar
modular structure consisting of six regions (denoted a-f),
including a dna binding domain (denoted c) and a ligand
binding domain (denoted e). homodimeric and heterodimeric complex formation occurs via dimerization interfaces in
the dna binding domains and in the ligand binding domains
(zhang et al., 1992; rosen et al., 1993; zechel et al., 1994;
perlmann et al., 1996). because rxrs can potentially form
either homodimers or heterodimers when mixed with rars,
the physical isolation of purified rar-rxr heterocomplexes from mixtures of the two receptors is important prior
to further characterization of their properties. the isolation
of rar-rxr heterocomplexes would greatly aid in understanding the structural basis of the interactions between
these two receptors and with their ligands.
in the current work, we have focused on the interactions
between the ligand binding domains of rar and rxr, by
employing a gst-hrxrrdef fusion protein (cheng et al.,
1994) to copurify recombinant hrargammade domains by

report here the isolation of hrargammade-hrxrrdef complexes retaining full ligand binding capacity and the characterization of their interactions with natural and synthetic
retinoids.
experimental procedures
materials.  xxxd3417xxx  was obtained from
kodak. [11,12-3h(n)]- xxxd3417xxx  (49.3 ci/
mmol) was obtained from dupont nen (wilmington, de).
[11,12-3h(n)]-9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  (54 ci/mmol), unlabeled
9-cis- xxxd3417xxx , and  xxxd71xxx  [all-e-9-(4-methoxy-2,3,6trimethylphenyl)-3,7-dimethyl-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid]
were provided by hoffmann-laroche. the rxr-selective
ligand  xxxd330xxx , 4-[(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro2-naphthyl)ethenyl] xxxd306xxx  (boehm et al., 1994), was
a kind gift of dr. tim willson (glaxo). thrombin, glutathione-agarose, glutathione (reduced form), and 13-cisretinoic acid were from sigma. all procedures involving
retinoids were performed under dim or red light.
expression and purification of recombinant  xxxd3417xxx 
binding proteins. recombinant mouse  xxxg1938xxx  and
 xxxg512xxx  were expressed, purified, delipidated, and quantitated as described previously (norris et al., 1994). the
construction of gst-hrxrrdef (amino acids 198-462)
fusion protein expression vectors was described previously
(cheng et al., 1994). the truncated hrargammade (amino acids
151-421) cdna, incorporating a 5′ ndei site and a 3′
bamhi site, was amplified from the full-length hrargamma
cdna (saiki et al., 1988) using the upstream forward primer
5′-gcatatgtccaaggaagctgtgcg-3′ and the downstream reverse primer 5′-gcgatccttattacatttcagggttctccag-3′ by the polymerase chain reaction. the
truncated rar cdna was digested with ndei and bamhi,
and ligated into ndei/bamhi-digested pet29a (novagen,
madison, wi).
prokaryotic expression of the recombinant nuclear retinoic
acid receptors was carried out in the escherichia coli strain
bl21(de3) (lon-, ompt-) (studier et al., 1990). the
expression of the gst fusion proteins was carried out as
described previously (cheng et al., 1994). for expression
of the truncated hrargammade ligand binding domain, a 20 ml
overnight culture grown in lb broth containing kanamycin
(50 µg/ml) was inoculated into 1 l of lb broth containing
kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and incubated at 37 °c until an od600
of 0.8 was reached. isopropyl 1-thio-beta-d-galactopyranoside
was added to a final concentration of 0.15 mm, and the
cultures were incubated at 25 °c for an additional 3 h. cells
were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °c. cells
expressing gst-hrxrrdef or hrargammade were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.8,
40 mm kcl, 2 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta, 10
µm  xxxd3556xxx , 5% glycerol, 0.01%  xxxd2668xxx , and 0.02%
azide) per liter of culture at 4 °c. the cells were lysed by
sonication (30% output, 50% duty, 30 min) on ice using a
branson sonifier model 250/450 (branson ultrasonics corp.,
danbury, ct). the lysates were clarified by centrifugation
at 10000g for 30 min.
one hundred milliliters of crude bacterial soluble extract
containing gst-rxrrdef prepared from 2 l of culture
was applied to 35 ml of glutathione-agarose beads. the
beads were washed extensively with 2 l of lysis buffer at 4

tian et al.
°c. then 500 ml of crude bacterial soluble extract
containing hrargammade peptide prepared from 8 l of culture
was applied to the beads and washed with 2 l of lysis buffer.
the glutathione-agarose beads were washed with 2 volumes
of digestion buffer (lysis buffer with the addition of 0.15 m
nacl and 2.5 µm cacl2), and incubated with 50 units of
human thrombin in 30 ml of digestion buffer at 4 °c for 5
h, following which the thrombin was inactivated by the
addition of 1 mm  xxxd302xxx . under these conditions, the
hrxrrdef peptides were cleaved from gst while bound
to glutathione-agarose, and the cleaved rar-rxr ligand
binding domain complexes were recovered in the supernatant.
the cleaved peptides were further purified by gel filtration
over a 2.6 cm × 60 cm superdex 200 (pharmacia) column
equilibrated with tkme-150 buffer (25 mm tris-hcl, ph
7.9, 150 mm kcl, 2 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta)
at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 4 °c. the column was
calibrated using the following molecular mass standards:
 xxxg569xxx , 12.4 kda; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kda;
ovalbumin, 45 kda; bovine  xxxg124xxx , 67 kda; alcohol
dehydrogenase, 150 kda; beta-amylase, 200 kda.
fluorescence measurements. fluorescence measurements
were made with a photon technology international spectrofluorometer equipped with constant-temperature cell holders. samples were excited at 280 nm and monitored at 330
nm using slits widths of 2 and 5 nm, respectively. ligand
dissolved in ethanol was titrated into samples such that the
final total ethanol concentration did not exceed 0.5% (v/v).
titration measurements and inner filter effect corrections
were performed as previously described (norris et al., 1994)
at 25 °c in tkme-150 buffer. ligand stock concentrations
were calculated based on the following molar absorption
coefficients:  xxxd3417xxx , 45 000 m-1 cm-1 at 350
nm (cogan et al., 1976); 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx , 36 500 m-1 cm-1
at 343 nm (redfern et al., 1993);  xxxd71xxx , 43 300 m-1 cm-1
at 353 nm (norris et al., 1994); and  xxxd330xxx , 16 400 m-1
cm-1 at 364 nm (boehm et al., 1994). concentrations of
stock receptor protein solutions were determined based on
quantitative amino acid analysis as described previously (li
et al., 1987).
binding stoichiometries and apparent dissociation constants, kd′, were determined by nonlinear regression fitting
of the fluorescence data to an equation derived from simple
binding theory as described previously (norris et al., 1994).
photolabeling of receptor subsites with [3h] xxxd3417xxx .
purified hrxrrdef or hrargammade-hrxrrdef was equilibrated with [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  or [3h]-9-cis-retinoic
acid for 10 min at room temperature. ten microliter aliquots
of the mixture containing 7.5 nmol of each peptide plus 2
pmol (0.1 µci) of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  or 2 pmol (0.1
µci) of [3h]-9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  were moved to the wells of
a polycarbonate, 96-well micro-sample plate (pharmacia).
the plate was exposed to a 365 nm uv light source
(mineralight uvsl-25, ultraviolet products inc.) at a
distance of 1-2 cm above the plate for 10 min. incident
uv radiation was estimated  xxxd1891xxx -3 w/cm2, based on
readings taken with a radiometer (model il1700; international light inc., newburyport, ma). following uv light
exposure, the samples were combined with sds-page
sample buffer containing  xxxd26xxx  (laemmli, 1970)
and analyzed by sds-page using 15% polyacrylamide
gels. the gels were stained with coomassie blue, soaked
in en3hance (nen, boston, ma), and fluorographed

using kodak xar-film (eastman kodak, rochester,
ny).
partitioning of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  between crabp
and hrargammade-hrxrrdef. four picomoles of [3h]-alltrans- xxxd3417xxx  (0.2 µci) dissolved in ethanol was added
to 5 nmol of  xxxg1938xxx  or -ii and mixed with either
hrxrrdef (5 nmol) or hrargammade-hrxrrdef (5 nmol
of each peptide) in a final volume of 2.5 ml of tkme-150.
each sample was subject to size-exclusion chromatography
over superdex 200 equilibrated with tkme-150 buffer at a
flow rate of 1 ml/min at 4 °c. the radioactivity of collected
fractions (4 ml) was determined by liquid scintillation
counting. in some experiments, 10 nmol of  xxxd71xxx  was
added immediately prior to the addition of [3h]-all-transretinoic acid.
relative binding affinities were calculated from the relative
amounts of radioactivity which coeluted with each species
using eq 1 which is derived from the relevant binding
partition function (wyman & gill, 1990).

kd dcpm[c]

(1)

the terms ccpm and dcpm represent the amounts of
radioactivity coeluting with crabp or dimer, respectively.
kc and kd are the association constants for the binding of
 xxxd3417xxx  to crabp and dimer, respectively.
because of the high molar excess of protein over ligand in
these experiments, the unliganded amounts of crabp, [c],
and dimer, [d], are virtually equal to their total concentrations. the relative amounts of tetramer and dimer were
determined from the relative areas of their elution a280
profiles. under these conditions, roughly equal amounts of
tetramer and dimer eluted from the column. of note, this
ratio was changed little by the addition of substoichiometric
amounts of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  or by the addition of
stoichiometric amounts of  xxxd71xxx .
results
purification of hrargammade-hrxrrdef heterocomplexes.
the gst-hrxrrdef fusion protein described previously
(cheng et al., 1994) was used to isolate complexes of rarrxr ligand binding domains for further analysis. the
gst-hrxrrdef fusion protein from crude bacterial
extracts was initially adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads
followed by adsorption of hrargammade from crude bacterial
extracts as described under experimental procedures. complexes of hrargammade-hrxrrdef were eluted by thrombin
cleavage of the matrix-bound gst-hrxrrdef fusion
protein. approximately 20 mg of cleaved protein complex
was recovered from 2 and 8 l of bacterial cultures expressing
gst-hrxrrdef and hrargammade, respectively, in the
column eluate. the protein complex was further fractionated
by size-exclusion chromatography over superdex 200 into
four fractions (1-4) with relative a280 ratios of 2:1:6:6 (see
figure 1). equivalent amounts of the hrargammade and
hrxrrdef peptides were detected in fractions 2-4, as
quantitated by scanning densitometry of coomassie-stained
sds-polyacrylamide gels (see figure 1). the only peptide
detected in fraction 1 was hrxrrdef. the estimated
molecular mass of the protein in fraction 1 based on its
retention time was 35 kda, which corresponds to the

figure 1: size-exclusion chromatography of hrargammadehrxrrdef complexes isolated by affinity chromatography. (a)
the glutathione-sepharose affinity column eluate, recovered after
thrombin cleavage of adsorbed gst-hrxrrdef fusion protein
and hrargammade, was loaded onto a superdex 200 gel filtration
column. elution of proteins was monitored by in-line detection of
sample a280. the column was previously standardized with proteins
of known molecular mass as shown. (b) coomasie-stained sds10% polyacrylamide gel of proteins recovered in fractions 1-4.

predicted molecular mass of monomeric hrxrrdef of 32
kda. the estimated molecular mass of fraction 2 was 65
kda, suggesting that the protein in this fraction consisted of
dimeric complexes of receptor ligand binding domains. the
estimated molecular mass of fraction 3 was 150 kda,
suggesting that the protein in this fraction consisted of
tetrameric complexes of receptor ligand binding domains.
fraction 4 eluted in the void volume of the column, indicating
that these complexes represented higher order multimers with
a molecular mass greater than 600 kda. rechromatography
of fraction 3 yielded complexes corresponding to both dimers
and tetramers, suggesting that there was exchange between
these two forms. further dissociation to monomer subunits
was not detected. the higher order multimers appeared to
be irreversibly aggregated, since no dissociation to lower
order complexes was observed on rechromatography of
fraction 4. in contrast, size-exclusion chromatography of
the hrxrrdef peptide alone revealed that the peptide was
predominantly in the monomer form (data not shown),
consistent with previous equilibrium sedimentation experiments (cheng et al., 1994).
fluorometric titration of hrargammade-hrxrrdef complexes with retinoids. fluorescence quenching methods were
utilized to assess the ligand binding activities of the
hrargammade-hrxrrdef heterocomplexes recovered in fractions 2-4. the heterocomplexes exhibited intrinsic protein
fluorescence with a maximum at 328 nm when excited at
290 nm, due to three tryptophans. two tryptophans are
contained in hrxrrdef at positions 282 and 305, while
one tryptophan is contained in hrargammade at position 227.
very little change of protein fluorescence was observed when

in tkme-150 and titrated as described under experimental
procedures. (panel a) complexes from fraction 3 (350 nm per
subsite) titrated with 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  (b) or all-trans-retinoic
acid (o); (panel b) complexes from fraction 2 (100 nm per subsite)
titrated with 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  (b),  xxxd3417xxx  (o), or
with 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  (0) after titration with all-trans-retinoic
acid; (panel c) complexes from fraction 3 (50 nm per subsite) were
titrated with  xxxd71xxx  (9) or  xxxd2404xxx  (0). for comparison, the titrations with  xxxd3417xxx  (o) and 9-cis-retinoic
acid (b) are also shown. dashed lines represent nonlinear fits.

increasing amounts of either  xxxd3417xxx  or 9-cisretinoic acid were added to the complexes recovered in the
void volume (i.e., fraction 4), indicating that these complexes
were essentially inactive with respect to ligand binding (data
not shown).
fluorescence titrations of the hrargammade-hrxrrdef
complexes recovered in fractions 2 or 3 with various retinoids
yielded essentially the same binding curves, as shown in
figure 2. the addition of 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  to the heterocomplexes recovered in fractions 2 and 3 resulted in a linear
decrease in protein fluorescence until the ligand binding sites
were saturated. at saturation, the binding of 9-cis-retinoic
acid to the rar-rxr complex decreased the total protein
fluorescence by 80%. the number of binding sites for 9-cisretinoic acid in the hrargammade-hrxrrdef complex was
0.94 ( 0.03 (n ) 2) per receptor subsite, with a kd′ of 3 (
1 nm (n ) 5).
the addition of  xxxd3417xxx  to the hrargammadehrxrrdef complexes recovered in fractions 2 or 3 also
resulted in a linear decrease in protein fluorescence until
saturation of the binding sites (figure 2). however, at
saturation, the binding of  xxxd3417xxx  decreased
the total protein fluorescence by only ∼40%. the number
of binding sites for  xxxd3417xxx  in the hrargammadehrxrrdef complex was 0.51 ( 0.07 (n ) 2) per receptor
subsite with a kd′ of 10 ( 7 nm (n ) 6). this is consistent
with  xxxd3417xxx  binding with high affinity only
to the rar subsite. addition of 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  to the

hrargammade-hrxrrdef complex after saturation of the alltrans- xxxd3417xxx  binding sites led to additional decreases
in protein fluorescence (figure 2b). based on an analysis
of the titration curves, the number of binding sites for 9-cisretinoic acid following titration with  xxxd3417xxx 
was calculated to be 0.49 ( 0.01 (n ) 3) with a kd′ of 5 (
2 nm (n ) 3). thus, the heterocomplexes recovered in
fractions 2 and 3 exhibited full ligand binding capacity.
two synthetic retinoids used in the clinical practice of
dermatology are isotretinoin ( xxxd2404xxx ) and  xxxd71xxx , the acid derivative of  xxxd2071xxx  (peck & digiovanna).
the addition of these retinoids to the purified recombinant
heterocomplexes from fraction 3 is shown in figure 2c and
demonstrates little change of protein fluorescence. similar
results were obtained for complexes in fraction 2 (data not
shown). this indicates that these two compounds bind
poorly to the rar-rxr heterocomplexes. while the
mechanism of action for  xxxd2404xxx  may involve
isomerization to  xxxd3417xxx  and/or 9-cis-retinoic
acid, the mechanism of action for  xxxd71xxx  is unclear since
it appears unable to act directly upon the rar-rxr
complexes.
to examine whether association with the unligated rar
ligand binding domain prevented the rxr ligand binding
domain from interacting with ligand, binding of an rxr
selective ligand,  xxxd330xxx  (boehm et al., 1994), to hrxrrdef
monomer was compared with binding to purified heterocomplex (figure 3). addition of  xxxd330xxx  to the hrxrrdef
monomer led to saturable decreases in protein fluorescence
(figure 3a), with 1.1 ( 0.3 binding sites per monomer and
a kd′ of 27 ( 17 nm (n ) 3). addition of  xxxd330xxx  to the
hrargammade-hrxrrdef heterocomplex also resulted in a
decrease in protein fluorescence (figure 3b), indicating that
the rxr subunit is still capable of binding this ligand with
a stoichiometry of 1.2 ( 0.5 when complexed with the
unligated rar subunit, but with a somewhat reduced
affinity, kd′ of 55 ( 16 nm (n ) 3) derived from analysis
of the titration curves.

unlabeled  xxxd3417xxx  exposed to uv light for 10 min.
(right panel, 9cra) photoaffinity labeling of hrargammadehrxrrdef complex and (lane 2) hrxrrdef monomer with
[3h]-9-cis- xxxd3417xxx . equivalent amounts of the rxr subunit
(7.5 nmol) were included in each sample.

photoaffinity labeling of binding subsites in hrargammadehrxrrdef heterocomplexes. the localization of bound
 xxxd3417xxx  and 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  within the
heterocomplexes could be further characterized by photoaffinity labeling.  xxxd3417xxx  has been reported
to specifically photolabel crabp and albumin in complex
mixtures of cytosolic proteins (bernstein et al., 1995). as
shown in figure 4, photolabeling of the rar subsite in the
hrargammade-hrxrrdef heterocomplex with [3h]-all-transretinoic acid was observed. the labeling occurred with an
estimated efficiency of 20% and required uv light exposure.
it was greatly reduced by the addition of a 375-fold molar
excess of unlabeled  xxxd3417xxx  (see figure 4).
to determine whether 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  binds initially
to the rar or rxr subsite, a substoichiometric amount of
[3h]-9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  was added to the hrargammadehrxrrdef heterocomplex and exposed to uv light. as
shown in figure 4, there was preferential photolabeling of
the rar subsite within the heterocomplex, and the amount
incorporated in the rxr subsite within the heterocomplex
was reduced approximately 70% compared to the amount
incorporated into an equivalent amount of rxr monomer.
with the addition of increasing amounts of [3h]-9-cis-retinoic
acid, the difference in the amount of label incorporated into
monomeric hrxrrdef compared to the heterocomplexes
was eliminated (data not shown).
partitioning of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  between
crabps and the rar-rxr complexes. size exclusion
chromatography of purified proteins mixed with substoichiometric amounts of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  was used to
directly compare the relative binding affinities of all-transretinoic acid for the crabps and the purified nuclear

binding equivalents of  xxxg512xxx  and the hrargammadehrxrrdef complex, 8 ( 3% (n ) 2) of the total

figure 5: partitioning of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  between the
crabps and hrargammade-hrxrrdef complexes. size-exclusion
chromatography was used to analyze partitioning of [3h]-all-transretinoic acid (4 pmol) between (a)  xxxg512xxx  (5 nmol) and
hrargammade-hrxrrdef (5 nmol each subunit); (b)  xxxg1938xxx  (5
nmol) and hrargammade-hrxrrdef (5 nmol each subunit); (c)
 xxxg1938xxx  (5 nmol), hrargammade-hrxrrdef (5 nmol each subunit), and  xxxd71xxx  (10 nmol). the positions at which the hrargammadehrxrrdef dimer and crabp elute are as shown.

3% was recovered in the hrargammade-hrxrrdef “dimeric”
fraction, and 2 ( 2% was recovered in the hrargammadehrxrrdef “tetrameric” fraction. when [3h]-all-transretinoic acid was added to equal binding equivalents of
 xxxg1938xxx  and the hrargammade-hrxrrdef complex, 49 (
8% (n ) 2) of the total radioactivity was recovered in the
 xxxg1938xxx  fraction, 38 ( 8% was recovered in the
hrargammade-hrxrrdef “dimeric” fraction, and 1.5 ( 0.4%
in the “tetrameric” fraction. when either crabp was mixed
with hrxrrdef monomer, nearly all of the loaded radioactivity was recovered in the  xxxg1938xxx  fraction (83%) or in
the  xxxg512xxx  fraction (86%) with less than 2% of the
radioactivity associated with the hrxrrdef monomer.
the high recovery of total radioactivity loaded onto the
superdex column indicates that there is little dissociation of
the protein-ligand complexes during fractionation by sizeexclusion chromatography. the absence of radioactivity
associated with the hrxrrdef monomer indicates that the
level of nonspecific association of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx 
with proteins is very low in this assay. the relative affinity
of the dimeric hrargammade-hrxrrdef complex for alltrans- xxxd3417xxx  is calculated to be (17 ( 5)-fold (n ) 2)
higher than the affinity of  xxxg512xxx  and (1.3 ( 0.1)-fold
higher than the affinity of  xxxg1938xxx  for all-trans-retinoic
acid at 4 °c, using eq 1. there was preferential association
of  xxxd3417xxx  with the dimeric form over the
tetrameric form of the heterocomplexes, indicating that the
dimeric complex has a much higher affinity for all-transretinoic acid than the tetrameric complex. consistent with
this, the addition of a stoichiometric amount of either alltrans- xxxd3417xxx  or 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  to the rar-rxr
complex results in complete disappearance of the tetrameric
species (data not shown).
 xxxd71xxx  increases the occupancy of the rar-rxr
complex by displacement of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx 
from  xxxg1938xxx .  xxxd71xxx , a synthetic aromatic retinoid
analog, is used in the treatment of severe psoriasis. its use
is limited by extreme teratogenicity. the above fluorescence
studies indicate that  xxxd71xxx  binds relatively poorly to the
hrargammade-hrxrrdef complex, while previous fluores-

5674 biochemistry, vol. 36, no. 19, 1997
cence studies have shown that it binds to  xxxg1938xxx  and
 xxxg512xxx  with high affinity (norris et al., 1994). a
mechanism by which  xxxd71xxx  exerts its biological effects
may involve an indirect signaling pathway by displacing
endogenous  xxxd3417xxx  complexed with the crabps
(norris et al., 1994). the effect of  xxxd71xxx  on the partitioning of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx  between  xxxg1938xxx  and
hrargammade-hrxrrdef was therefore examined. as shown
in figure 5, there was a dramatic shift in the distribution of
radioactivity between  xxxg1938xxx  and hrargammade-hrxrrdef
complex upon the addition of a stoichiometric amount of
 xxxd71xxx  such that 82 ( 5% (n ) 2) of the radioactivity eluted
with the dimeric form of the complex. the amount of
radioactivity associated with  xxxg1938xxx  was reduced to 14
( 5% (n ) 2). similarly,  xxxd71xxx  reduced the amount of
radioactivity associated with  xxxg512xxx  (from 69% to 28%)
and increased the amount associated with the hrargammadehrxrrdef complex (from 17% to 57%) in a mixture
containing 25 nmol of  xxxg512xxx  and 2.5 nmol of
hrargammade-hrxrrdef. the addition of  xxxd71xxx  thus
increased  xxxd3417xxx  occupancy of the nuclear
receptor by displacing  xxxd3417xxx  from the
cytoplasmic binding proteins.
discussion
we have purified heterocomplexes of hrargammade with
hrxrrdef which retain full ligand binding capacity. rxr
can potentially form homodimers as well as heterodimers
with rars when the two receptors are mixed together. we
have therefore taken steps to further fractionate the complexes by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. we found that the purified heterocomplexes
exhibited heterogeneity with respect to oligomerization states
and binding capacity. approximately 50% of the heterocomplexes were recovered after affinity chromatography as
dimers and tetramers which retained full ligand binding
capacity as measured by fluorescence quenching methods.
dissociation of the tetrameric species to the dimeric species
was observed on rechromatography of fraction 3, suggesting
that the two forms are in equilibrium. the remaining half
were recovered as very large oligomers (>600 kda) which
are inactive with respect to ligand binding.
the active forms of the purified recombinant heterocomplexes exhibited half of the number of binding sites for alltrans- xxxd3417xxx  as for 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  as predicted.
analysis of ligand binding by the heterocomplexes was
complicated by the linkage between ligation and the oligomerization state of the heterocomplexes, as evidenced by the
disappearance of the tetrameric forms on the addition of a
stoichiometric amount of  xxxd3417xxx  or 9-cisretinoic acid as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. a similar dissociation of tetramers comprised of e.
coli-derived rxrr lacking the n-terminal a/b domain
(rxrr∆ab) was observed with ligation (kersten et al.,
1995). in contrast, e. coli-derived hrarr, which existed
primarily as monomers in the absence of ligand as determined by size-exclusion chromatography, formed homodimers after binding  xxxd3417xxx  (lefebvre et
al., 1995). while the linkage of ligation with changes in
oligomerization states suggests that the rar-rxr ligand
binding domain complexes are allosteric systems, it is
difficult to predict the physiological significance of the
various oligomerization states observed for the recombinant

tian et al.
heterocomplex of rar and rxr ligand binding domains.
the aggregation of recombinant truncated receptors is
affected by relatively minor changes such as the degree of
receptor truncation, growth conditions for the bacterial
cultures, and the specific fusion peptide used (cheng et al.,
1994; berggren söderlund et al., 1995; lupsiella et al.,
1995). for example, 50% of purified histidine-tagged
hrxrrdef (amino acids 200-462) peptide (bourguet et
al., 1995a,b) is recovered as homodimers, whereas
hrxrrdef (amino acids 198-462) peptide obtained by
thrombin cleavage of the gst-fusion protein is recovered
primarily as monomers. we have observed that heterocomplexes formed between the hrxrrdef monomer and
recombinant hrargammade protein fused with the 21 amino acid
peptide containing a histidine-tag precipitated at relatively
low protein concentrations.2
the localization of bound  xxxd3417xxx  and 9-cisretinoic acid within the complex was further characterized
by photoaffinity labeling. photoaffinity labeling of the
purified heterocomplexes with [3h]- xxxd3417xxx 
exclusively labeled the rar subsite as predicted. with the
addition of substoichiometric amounts of [3h]-9-cis-retinoic
acid to the heterocomplexes, there was initially preferential
labeling of the rar subsite over the rxr subsite. this is
consistent with previous reports that the rars exhibit a
higher binding affinity for 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  than do the
rxrs (heyman et al., 1992; levin et al., 1992; allenby et
al., 1993; allegretto et al., 1993). alternatively, there may
be allosteric interactions between the unliganded rar that
prevent binding of ligand to the rxr subsite (kurokawa et
al., 1994; forman et al., 1995), although this has not been
observed by other investigators (kersten et al., 1996).
fluorescence studies indicate that the rxr-selective ligand
 xxxd330xxx  binds to the rxr subsite when associated with
unliganded rar but with somewhat reduced affinity. these
results indicate that while association with the unligated rar
ligand binding domain does not prevent binding to the rxr
subsite, there does appear to be a quantitative effect on the
affinity of the rxr subsite due to interaction between the
two subsites, independent of receptor interactions with dna.
the mechanism by which  xxxd3417xxx  is photochemically
linked to proteins remains to be determined, but it is
presumed that free radical species as well as photooxidation
products such as the 5,6-epoxide are formed when retinoic
acid is photodecomposed (bernstein et al., 1995). x-ray
analysis of crystalline recombinant hrargammade reveals the
presence of a number of amino acid residues containing
functional groups that could potentially react with intermediates produced by photodecomposition of bound all-transretinoic acid, such as cys-227 (renaud et al., 1995). as
rargamma is the predominant  xxxd3417xxx  receptor subtype in
human epidermis (fisher et al., 1994), the observation that
hrargammade can be photolabeled by light of modest intensity
may potentially be of physiological significance.
the dissociation constants of the cytoplasmic and nuclear
retinoid binding proteins as determined by fluorometric
titration represent only an upper estimate (norris et al., 1994;
kersten et al., 1996). we have directly compared the relative
binding affinities of the recombinant nuclear and cytoplasmic
 xxxd3417xxx  binding proteins by measuring the distribution
2

rar-rxr ligand binding domains
of a substoichiometric amount of [3h]- xxxd3417xxx 
between the proteins. these experiments demonstrate that
at 4 °c,  xxxd3417xxx  binds with comparable affinity
to the nuclear receptor heterocomplexes and  xxxg1938xxx . this
is consistent with the observation that increases in  xxxg1938xxx 
levels are correlated with decreases in  xxxd3417xxx -dependent
transactivation (boylan & gudas, 1991).
our studies demonstrate that  xxxd3417xxx  binds
to the nuclear receptor heterocomplexes with ca. 10-fold
higher affinity than to  xxxg512xxx . by extrapolation of these
data, the binding affinity of  xxxg1938xxx  for all-trans-retinoic
acid is estimated to be ca. 10-fold higher than that of
 xxxg512xxx , which is consistent with a number of previous
studies which report that  xxxg1938xxx  binds all-trans-retinoic
acid with higher affinity than does  xxxg512xxx  (li & norris,
1996). these results suggest that  xxxg1938xxx  will more
effectively sequester  xxxd3417xxx  from the nuclear
receptors than will an equivalent amount of  xxxg512xxx .
fluorescence titration studies indicate that  xxxd71xxx  binds
poorly to purified hrargammade-hrxrrdef complexes but
binds with high affinity to the crabps (norris et al., 1994).
this is consistent with previous studies demonstrating poor
binding of  xxxd71xxx  to the recombinant rarbeta ligand binding
domain (berggren söderland et al., 1995), as well as poor
transactivation of rars in cv-1 cells by  xxxd71xxx  (åström
et al., 1990). the mechanism by which  xxxd71xxx  exerts its
biological effect may therefore differ significantly from the
retinoids that directly transactivate the rars.
we have shown that  xxxd71xxx  induces a significant shift
of  xxxd3417xxx  from  xxxg1938xxx  and  xxxg512xxx  to
hrargammade-hrxrrdef dimers, suggesting that  xxxd71xxx 
could perturb the distribution of endogenous  xxxd3417xxx 
between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the
cell and thus indirectly affect retinoid signaling. whether
the displacement of crabp-bound  xxxd3417xxx  by  xxxd71xxx 
observed in vitro has physiological relevance in vivo remains
to be determined. of note, both crabps are expressed at
high levels in the epidermis (a° ström, 1994; siegenthaler et
al., 1992), and the therapeutic  xxxd71xxx  levels achieved in
the skin are considerably higher than  xxxd3417xxx 
levels (siegenthaler et al., 1992). the responsiveness of
tissue culture lines to  xxxd71xxx  may correlate with the
presence or absence of crabp. hl-60 promyelocytic
leukemia cells, which differentiate in response to retinoic
acid but not in response to  xxxd71xxx  (chomienne et al., 1986),
contain no detectable crabp (nervi et al., 1989), and f9
embryonal carcinoma cells, which do differentiate in response
to  xxxd71xxx , contain crabp (bailly et al., 1990). although
overexpression of  xxxg1938xxx  reduces  xxxd3417xxx  responsiveness in f9 cells (boylan & gudas, 1991), somewhat
contrary results were observed in primary cultures of murine
embryonic palate cells (nugent & greene, 1995), and no
consistent effect was observed in cos-1 cells that were also
overexpressing rar and rar-rxr (venepally et al.,
1996). mutant mice lacking  xxxg1938xxx  and/or  xxxg512xxx  (de
bruijn et al., 1994; gorry et al., 1994; fawcett et al., 1995;
lampron et al., 1995) probably represent the most definitive
experimental system for examining whether the crabps
play a significant role in  xxxd71xxx  signaling and toxicity.
while these mice have been shown not to have increased
susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of excess  xxxd3417xxx ,
they may exhibit reduced susceptibility to the teratogenic
effects of  xxxd71xxx .

biochemistry, vol. 36, no. 19, 1997 5675
the copurification of recombinant hrargammade with the
gst-hrxrrdef fusion protein indicates that these two
receptors interact strongly via their ligand binding domains.
this observation coupled with the observation that the
hrxrrdef peptide exists predominantly in monomeric
form (cheng et al., 1994) suggests that association of rxr
with rar is favored over rxr self-association at the ligand
binding domain interface. this is consistent with previous
coimmunoprecipitation experiments reported by marks et al.
(1992) and cotransfection experiments with gal4 and vp16 hybrid fusions with the ligand binding domains of rar
and rxr reported by perlmann et al. (1996). the strong
interactions between the rar and rxr ligand binding
domains probably represent the structural basis for the
dominant repression of  xxxd3417xxx -dependent transactivation by truncated rxrbeta (minnuci et al., 1994; bases et al.,
1994) and rarbeta (shen et al., 1993) receptors lacking the
dna binding domains.
the dimerization of the interface between rxr ligand
binding domains has been described (bourget et al., 1995a).
the structural basis for the interactions between the rxr
and rar ligand binding domains remains to be precisely
defined. analysis of truncated and chimeric receptors
suggests that the homo- and heterodimerization surfaces of
rxr are not completely identical (zhang et al., 1994; leng
et al., 1995; perlmann et al., 1996). structural analysis of
these purified recombinant heterocomplexes may provide
further insight regarding the heterodimerization interface
between the rxr and rar ligand binding domains.
