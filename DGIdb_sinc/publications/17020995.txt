abstract

purpose: we determined the effects of  xxxd3529xxx  [ xxxd3529xxx  (saha)]
and/or  xxxd1815xxx , a dual abl/src kinase ( xxxg2198xxx ) inhibitor, on the cultured human
(k562 and lama-84) or primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) cells, as well as on the
murine pro-b baf3 cells with ectopic expression of the unmutated and kinase domain-mutant
forms of bcr-abl.
experimental design: following exposure to  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx , apoptosis, loss of
clonogenic survival, as well as the activity and levels of bcr-abl and its downstream signaling
proteins were determined.
results: treatment with  xxxd1815xxx  attenuated the levels of autophosphorylated bcr-abl, p-crkl,
phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (p- xxxg2216xxx ), p- xxxg2198xxx , and p-lyn;
inhibited the activity of lyn and  xxxg2198xxx ; and induced apoptosis of the cultured cml cells.
combined treatment of cultured human cml and baf3 cells with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx 
induced more apoptosis than either agent alone, as well as synergistically induced loss of clonogenic survival, which was associated with greater depletion of bcr-abl, p-crkl, and p- xxxg2216xxx 
levels. cotreatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  also attenuated the levels of bcr-able255k
and bcr-ablt315i and induced apoptosis of baf3 cells with ectopic expression of the mutant
forms of bcr-abl. finally, cotreatment of the primary cml cells with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx 
induced more loss of cell viability and depleted bcr-abl or bcr-ablt315i, p- xxxg2216xxx , and p-crkl
levels than either agent alone.
conclusions: as shown here, the preclinical in vitro activity of  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  against
cultured and primary cml cells supports the in vivo testing of the combination in imatinib
mesylate ^ sensitive and  xxxd2333xxx  ^ resistant cml cells.

the fusion oncogene bcr-abl encoded bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx 
activates many pro-growth and cell survival mechanisms, which
confer resistance to apoptosis (1, 2). these include increased
phosphorylation and transactivation by signal transducer and
activator of transcription-5 ( xxxg2216xxx ), which leads to increased
expression of the antiapoptotic  xxxg251xxx  and pim-2 protein (3 – 5),
as well as increased ras/raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/
extracellular signal – regulated kinase (erk) kinase/ xxxg1369xxx /2,
akt, and nuclear factor-nb activity (1, 2, 6, 7). through

deregulated akt activity, bcr-abl inhibits the forkhead transcription regulator foxo3a, which leads to depletion of the
cyclin-dependent kinase-2 inhibitor p27 and the bh3 domainonly – containing proapoptotic bim protein (8 – 10). collectively, these molecular perturbations promote cell proliferation
and survival and contribute to bcr-abl-mediated leukemia
transformation of bone marrow progenitor cells. clinical
studies have shown that bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx  remains a
therapeutic target in all phases of chronic myelogenous
leukemia (cml; ref. 11). although highly active in inducing
clinical and cytogenetic complete remissions in many cml
patients, resistance to  xxxd2333xxx  (im; gleevec) is an
increasing clinical problem in cml, especially in the accelerated phase and blast crisis phase where only short-term
responses are observed (11). the major mechanisms of
resistance to im include mutations in the kinase domain of
bcr-abl, amplification of the bcr-abl gene, as well as bcr-ablindependent mechanisms of resistance (12 – 16). within the
bcr-abl kinase domain, close to 40 known point mutations
have been described. these have been linked to im resistance in
cml (17). the mutations are of two broad categories: those
that directly interfere with the ability of im to bind to the kinase

domain (e.g., t315i) and those that impair the ability of bcrabl to achieve inactive conformation required for binding to
im (e.g., e255k, p-loop mutation; ref. 18). bcr-abl mutations
impart varying degrees of resistance to im. some remain
susceptible to higher concentrations of im whereas others that
interfere directly with the binding of bcr-abl to im (e.g., t315i,
involving the gatekeeper threonine residue) confer the highest
form of resistance to im (19). these findings highlight the need
to develop and test novel anti-bcr-abl agents that are more
potent than im and/or are able to override the resistance to im
due to either mutations or amplifications of bcr-abl.
 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) is a synthetic, small-molecule,
thiazole-based, orally bioavailable, atp-competitive, dual abl/
src kinase inhibitor (20).  xxxd1815xxx  has been shown to inhibit
the activity of the src kinase family members  xxxg2198xxx  and lyn
(21, 22).  xxxd1815xxx  is able to bind the active and inactive
conformations of abl and inhibits the  xxxg2198xxx  activity of
bcr-abl (23, 24).  xxxd1815xxx  is f325-fold more potent than im
in inhibiting the activity of bcr-abl (25, 26). crkl is a 39-kda,
tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor protein, which is involved in
hematopoietic and leukemia cell signaling and is an important
substrate of bcr-abl (27). inhibition of bcr-abl activity in cml
cells has been gauged by the decline in the levels of
phosphorylated crkl (13). importantly, in vitro studies have
shown that  xxxd1815xxx  is also able to inhibit most clinically
significant im-resistant mutant isoforms of bcr-abl, but is
ineffective against bcr-ablt315i due to steric hindrance caused
by the side chain of the isoleucine (23, 26).  xxxd1815xxx  prolongs
the survival of mice with im-resistant, bcr-abl-dependent
leukemia, but the drug was ineffective against tumors expressing the mutant bcr-ablt315i (23). in phase i and early phase ii
studies,  xxxd1815xxx  has been reported to induce complete
hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imresistant or im-intolerant chronic phase of cml (28, 29).
however, the responses are significantly lower in patients with
more advanced phases of cml. taken together, these findings
suggest that to override primary or acquired mechanisms of
resistance in advanced phases of cml,  xxxd1815xxx  would have to
be combined with novel agents that are not only active against
im-resistant mutant forms of bcr-abl but would also be
effective in overriding non-bcr-abl-dependent mechanisms of
im resistance (30).
 xxxd3529xxx  [ xxxd3529xxx  (saha)] is a
hydroxamic acid – based polar  xxxd565xxx 
(31). treatment with hydroxamic acid analogue histone
deacetylase inhibitors leads to increased levels of genes
involved in cell cycle regulation such as p21 and p27,
generation of reactive oxygen species, induction of tnf-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand and its death receptors, as well as upregulation of the levels of the pro-death proteins (e.g., bax, bak
and bim; refs. 32 – 38). these agents are also known to deplete
the levels of antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx , x-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, akt, and pim-2) in human
leukemia cells (32 – 38). collectively, these effects inhibit cell
cycle growth, lower the threshold to apoptotic stimuli, and
induce apoptosis of cml cells. recent studies from our
laboratory have shown that treatment with the hydroxamic
acid analogue histone deacetylase inhibitors alone (e.g.,
 xxxd3529xxx ,  xxxd1797xxx , and  xxxd2839xxx ) also depleted bcr-abl, as
well as induced apoptosis and sensitized bcr-abl-expressing
leukemia cells to apoptosis induced by im (35 – 37). by

inducing acetylation of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) through
inhibition of  xxxg1037xxx , treatment with hydroxamic
acid analogue histone deacetylase inhibitors was shown to
inhibit the atp-binding and chaperone function of hsp90 (39).
this led to polyubiquitylation, proteasomal degradation, and
depletion of hsp90 client proteins, including bcr-abl, c-raf, and
akt (36, 37, 39). significantly, our studies also showed that
treatment with hydroxamic acid analogue histone deacetylase
inhibitors reduced the levels of the highly im-refractory bcrablt315i and induced apoptosis of primary im-refractory cml
blast crisis cells (36, 37). based on the strong rationale
generated by these observations, we determined the combined
effects of  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  against cultured and primary,
im-sensitive or im-resistant, human cml cells, including
those that expressed bcr-ablt315i. we also determined the
effects of the combination against mouse pro-b baf3 cells with
ectopic expression of the unmutated bcr-abl or bcr-able255k
and bcr-ablt315i.

creation of baf3/bcr-abl, baf3/bcr-able255k, and baf3/
bcr-ablt315i cell lines. mutant bcr-abl-containing plasmids were
generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pstarp210bcr-abl or
psvneobcr-abl, as previously described (36). briefly, the p210bcrable255k and p210bcr-ablt315i constructs were created by sitedirected mutagenesis of a bcr-abl-containing psvneo construct using
a quikchange ii xl kit (stratagene, cedar creek, tx) according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer, and the resulting clones were
sequenced to confirm the point mutation (41, 42). for nucleofection of
the p210 bcr-abl constructs into baf3 cells, 5  106 baf3 cells in 100 al
of nucleofector solution v (amaxa, gaithersburg, md) were mixed
with 5 ag of either p210 bcr-abl wild type, p210 bcr-abl (t315i), or
p210 bcr-abl (e255k) in a cuvette and nucleofected using program
g-16. following nucleofection, the cells were incubated at a concentration of 1  106/ml in complete rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10%
wehi medium as the source of  xxxg1177xxx , overnight, to recover. stable
transfectants of baf3 cells expressing the wild-type or mutant form
of bcr-abl (i.e., t315i or e255k) were maintained in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% serum, 1.0 unit/ml penicillin, 1 ag/ml streptomycin, and 0.75 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx . stably expressing cells were then
further selected by removal of  xxxg1177xxx . after confirmation of bcr-abl
expression by immunoblot analysis, cells were used for the studies
described below.

im-resistant advanced phase of cml were harvested and purified as
previously described (35 – 37). informed consents were signed by all
patients to allow use of their cells for these experiments, as part of a
clinical protocol approved by the university of south florida
institutional review board.
colony growth inhibition. following treatment with the designated
concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  for 48 hours, untreated
and drug-treated cells were washed in rpmi 1640. then, 200 cells
treated under each condition were plated in duplicated wells in a 12well plate containing 1.0 ml of methocult medium (stem cell
technologies, inc., vancouver, canada) per well according to the
protocol of the manufacturer. the plates were placed in an incubator at
37jc with 5% co2 for 7 days. following this incubation, colonies
consisting of z50 cells in each well were counted with an inverted
microscope and the percent colony growth inhibition compared with
the untreated control cells was calculated.
cell lysis and protein quantitation. untreated or drug-treated cells
were centrifuged and the cell pellets were resuspended in 200 al of lysis
buffer [1% triton x-100, 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
10 ag/ml leupeptin, 1 ag/ml pepstatin a, 2 ag/ml aprotinin,
20 mmol/l  xxxd2822xxx , 0.5 mmol/l sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmol/l 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride] and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. the cell lysates were
centrifuged and an aliquot of each cell lysate was diluted 1:10 and
protein quantitated with a bicinchoninic acid protein quantitation kit
(pierce, rockford, il) according to the protocol of the manufacturer.
western blot analysis. western blot analyses of bcr-abl, p- xxxg2216xxx ,
p-crkl, p-lyn, p-src,  xxxg2216xxx , crkl,  xxxg2198xxx , lyn, p21, p27,  xxxg251xxx ,
a-tubulin, and h-actin were done on total cell lysates using specific
antisera or monoclonal antibodies, as previously described (35 – 40).
the expression level of either h-actin or a-tubulin was used as the
loading control for the western blots.
immunoprecipitation of src and bcr-abl and immunoblot analysis. following designated treatments, cells were lysed with the lysis
buffer as described above. bcr-abl was immunoprecipitated from total
cell lysates of untreated and drug-treated cells with a monoclonal anti-cabl antibody from santa cruz biotechnology and incubated at 4jc for
1 to 2 hours on a rotator. prewashed protein-g beads were added to the
lysate mixture and incubated overnight at 4jc on a rotator. the
immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and
eluted from the agarose beads by boiling with 6 sds sample buffer
before immunoblot analysis. total  xxxg2198xxx  was immunoprecipitated from
treated or untreated total cell lysates with a rabbit polyclonal antibody
from santa cruz biotechnology and incubated at 4jc for 1 to 2 hours
on a rotator. prewashed protein-a beads were added to the lysate
mixture and incubated overnight at 4jc on a rotator. the immunoprecipitates were washed and eluted for sds-page as described above.
src kinase assay. k562 or lama-84 cells (107) were treated with
 xxxd1815xxx  for 24 hours. one milligram of total cell lysate was used for
immunoprecipitation of either src or lyn. for immunoprecipitation,
3 ag of anti-v-src monoclonal antibody (calbiochem, san diego, ca)
or 5 ag of anti-lyn (santa cruz biotechnology) were incubated for
3 hours with the total cell lysate on a rotator at 4jc (22, 43). protein-g
beads were added to the lysate-antibody mixture and incubated on a
rotator overnight at 4jc. the following day, the agarose beads were
washed six times with 500 al of lysis buffer and once with 500 al of
1 kinase buffer [100 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 7.2), 125 mmol/l mgcl2,
5 mmol/l mncl2, 2 mmol/l egta, 2 mmol/l dtt, and 250 amol/l
na3vo4]. for the kinase reaction, the beads were resuspended in 30 al
of 1 kinase buffer. ten micrograms of  xxxg1073xxx  –
purified gab1ct and 10 aci of [g-32p]atp (perkin-elmer, boston, ma)
were added and the reaction was incubated at 30jc for 15 minutes
(43). the kinase reactions were terminated by adding 5 al of 6 sds
sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 minutes. the boiled
samples were centrifuged briefly to pellet the agarose beads. the
proteins were separated by sds-page, transferred to nitrocellulose, and
visualized by autoradiography.

fig. 2. cotreatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  causes more depletion of bcr-abl activity, induces greater cell cycle arrest, inhibits more colony growth than either agent
alone, and induces synergistic apoptotic effects. a, k562 and lama-84 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  for 24 hours.
bcr-abl was immunoprecipitated from the total cell lysates and western blot analysis was done for tyrosine-phosphorylated bcr-abl. the blot was stripped and probed for
total bcr-abl levels. immunoblots were done for bcr-abl levels on the same cell lysates. the levels of h-actin served as the loading control. b, k562 cells were treated with
 xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  for 24 hours. cells were fixed and stained for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. c, analysis of dose-effect relationship for  xxxd1815xxx  (1-5 nmol/l)
and  xxxd3529xxx  (1-5 amol/l) for the apoptotic effects after 48 hours of exposure was done according to the median effect of chou and talalay. then, the combination index
values were calculated. combination index (ci) <1, combination index = 1, and combination index >1represent synergism, additivity, and antagonism of the two agents,
respectively. d, k562 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  for 48 hours.then, colony growth in semisolid medium was assessed

analysis of cell cycle status. k562 or lama-84 cells were treated with
 xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  for 24 hours. cells were washed and fixed in
70% ethanol overnight. fixed cells were stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
and subjected to flow cytometry and analyses with modfit 3.0 (35 – 37).
assessment of apoptosis by  xxxg166xxx  staining. untreated or drugtreated cells were stained with  xxxg166xxx  (pharmingen, san diego, ca)
and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide and the percentage of apoptotic cells was
determined by flow cytometry (35 – 37). to analyze synergism between
 xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  in inducing apoptosis, k562 cells were treated
with  xxxd1815xxx  (1-5 nmol/l) and  xxxd3529xxx  (1-5 amol/l) at a constant
ratio of 1:1,000 for 48 hours. the percentage of apoptotic cells was
determined by flow cytometry. the combination index for each drug
combination was obtained by median dose effect of chou and talalay
using the combination index equation within the commercially available
software calcusyn (biosoft, ferguson, mo; ref. 44). combination index
values of <1.0 represent synergism of the two drugs in the combination.
assessment of percentage of nonviable cells. cells were stained with
trypan blue (sigma, st. louis, mo). the numbers of nonviable cells
were determined by counting the cells that showed trypan blue uptake
in a hemocytometer and reported as percentage of untreated control
cells (36, 37).

results
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits bcr-abl,  xxxg2198xxx , and lyn  xxxg2198xxx 
activities and induces apoptosis of k562 and lama84 cells. as a
dual abl/src kinase inhibitor,  xxxd1815xxx  is a significantly more
potent inhibitor of unmutated bcr-abl than imatinib (im) and
is able to inhibit the activity of nearly all of the mutant forms of
bcr-abl (23, 25, 26). although  xxxd1815xxx  has been shown to

clin cancer res 2006;12(19) october 1, 2006

inhibit ectopically expressed unmutated and mutated bcr-abl,
the kinase inhibitory effects of  xxxd1815xxx  have not been
documented against endogenous bcr-abl and  xxxg2198xxx  in human
cml cells. therefore, we first determined the kinase inhibitory,
cell cycle, and apoptotic effects of  xxxd1815xxx  in the cultured
cml k562 and lama-84 cells. figure 1a and b clearly shows
that exposure to low nanomolar concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx 
inhibits the autophosphorylation of bcr-abl and  xxxg2198xxx , as well
as depletes the kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated  xxxg2198xxx 
and lyn, as measured by the decrease in the phosphorylation of
the gab1ct substrate in the in vitro kinase assay (22).
concomitantly,  xxxd1815xxx  attenuated the intracellular levels of
p- xxxg2216xxx , p-crkl, p-src, and p-lyn in a dose-dependent
manner. this was accompanied by a striking increase in p27
but a decline in the levels of c-myc and  xxxg251xxx , which are
transactivated by  xxxg2216xxx . no significant change occurred in the
levels of bcr-abl and  xxxg2198xxx  or of lyn,  xxxg2216xxx , and crkl. exposure
to 2.0 to 10 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  also induced apoptosis of k562
and lama-84 in a dose-dependent manner, with f90%
apoptosis of lama-84 and 50% apoptosis of k562 cells at
the 10 nmol/l concentration of  xxxd1815xxx  (fig. 1c).
cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  exerts synergistic
effects in k562 and lama-84 cells. in a previous report, we
showed that treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  attenuates bcr-abl, akt,
and c-raf levels and induces cell cycle growth arrest and
apoptosis of cml cells. additionally,  xxxd3529xxx  was shown to
sensitize cml cells to apoptosis induced by im (35). next, we
determined the effects of the combined treatment with

 xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  against cml

 xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  on cell cycle status, apoptosis, and
clonogenic survival of k562 and lama-84 cells. as compared
with the treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  or  xxxd1815xxx  alone, cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  caused more depletion of
the levels of autophosphorylated bcr-abl (fig. 2a). treatment
with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  also attenuated bcr-abl levels
more than treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  alone (fig. 2a). this was
accompanied by marked accumulation of the cells in the g1
phase and concomitant decline in the percent of cells in the s
phase of the cell cycle (fig. 2b), again more with the
combination than with either agent alone. combined treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  also induced synergistic
apoptotic effects against k562 cells, as determined by the
median dose-effect isobologram analysis described by chou
and talalay (fig. 2c). for  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx , the
combination index values were <1.0 in all cases. the
combination index values were 0.65, 0.55, 0.48, 0.51, and
0.56, respectively. a similar effect was noted against lama-84
cells (data not shown). the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx 
were also determined against normal bone marrow progenitor
cells. whereas  xxxd1815xxx  (up to 20 nmol/l) had no effect,
exposure to 2.0 amol/l  xxxd3529xxx  induced loss of survival of
15.9% of normal bone marrow progenitor cells (mean of two
samples with experiments done in duplicate). this loss of
survival was not augmented by cotreatment with 20 nmol/l
 xxxd1815xxx  (data not shown). we next determined the effects of
 xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  on the colony growth of k562 cells.
figure 2d shows that cotreatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx 
caused significantly more inhibition of colony growth than
treatment with either drug alone (p < 0.01). we also

fig. 3. cotreatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  enhances anti-bcr-abl activity
and attenuates levels of bcr-abl and p-crkl greater than either agent alone in k562
than in lama-84 cells. following treatment with 2 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  and/or
2 amol/l  xxxd3529xxx  for 24 hours,western blot analysis of p- xxxg2216xxx ,  xxxg2216xxx , p-crkl,

and lama-84. the levels of h-actin served as the loading control.

determined whether cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  enhances the
effects of  xxxd1815xxx  on bcr-abl activity and on the downstream
pro-growth and pro-survival signaling in k562 and lama-84
cells. as shown in fig. 3, compared with treatment with either
agent alone, cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx 
produced a greater decline in the levels of p-crkl in k562
and lama-84 cells. combined treatment was also highly
effective in lowering the levels of  xxxg251xxx , p-src, and p-lyn.
whereas  xxxd3529xxx  alone induced p21, cotreatment with
 xxxd1815xxx  abrogated  xxxd3529xxx -induced p21 levels.
 xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  induce apoptosis in baf3 cells
expressing unmutated or mutant bcr-abl. next, we determined
the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  in baf3 cells with
ectopic expression of either the unmutated bcr-abl or the point
mutants bcr-able255k or bcr-ablt315i. similar to the effects
seen in k562 and lama-84 with endogenous expression of
bcr-abl, treatment with 5.0 to 20 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  induced
apoptosis in baf3/bcr-abl cells in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 4a). following treatment with 20 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx ,
>70% of cells showed apoptosis. in contrast, baf3/bcrable255k cells were relatively less sensitive to dasatinibinduced apoptosis, showing a dose-dependent increase in
apoptosis at higher concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  (20-2,000
nmol/l; fig. 4a). baf3/bcr-ablt315i cells were resistant to im
up to levels as high as 10 amol/l (data not shown). baf3/bcrablt315i-expressing cells were also resistant to apoptosis
induced by high levels of  xxxd1815xxx  (2.0 amol/l). treatment
with  xxxd1815xxx  alone did not lower the levels of bcr-abl in
baf3 cells with ectopic expression of either the unmutated bcrabl or the point mutants bcr-able255k or bcr-ablt315i
(fig. 4b and c). whereas exposure to 5.0 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx 
markedly inhibited autophosphorylation of the unmutated
bcr-abl, higher concentration of  xxxd1815xxx  (20 nmol/l)
achieved a similar effect against bcr-able255k (fig. 4b).
similarly, the higher  xxxd1815xxx  levels were required to attenuate
p- xxxg2216xxx  and p-crkl levels in baf3/bcr-able255k versus baf3/
bcr-abl cells (fig. 4b).  xxxd1815xxx  did not appreciably inhibit
autophosphorylation of bcr-abl (data not shown) or lower
p- xxxg2216xxx  and p-crkl levels in baf3/bcr-ablt315i cells (fig. 4c).
on the other hand, in a dose-dependent manner,  xxxd3529xxx 
induced apoptosis not only of baf3/bcr-abl and baf3/bcrable255k but also of baf3/bcr-ablt315i cells (fig. 4d).
exposure to 2.0 amol/l  xxxd3529xxx  resulted in apoptosis of
f40% of baf3/bcr-able255k cells (fig. 4d). notably,
treatment with z1.0 amol/l  xxxd3529xxx  induced more apoptosis of baf3/bcr-ablt315i than of baf3/bcr-abl cells. this is
consistent with previous reports showing that cells expressing
the im-resistant t315i point mutant are more sensitive to
hydroxamic acid analogue histone deacetylase inhibitors than
unmutated bcr-abl-expressing cells (36, 37).
cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  enhances  xxxd1815xxx -induced
apoptosis of im-resistant baf3 cells including those expressing
bcr-ablt315i. we also determined the effects of treatment
with  xxxd3529xxx  on the levels of bcr-abl and downstream
signaling targets in baf3/bcr-abl, baf3/bcr-able255k, and
baf3/bcr-ablt315i cells. treatment of the baf3 transfectants
with  xxxd3529xxx  depleted bcr-ablt315i > bcr-able255k >
unmutated bcr-abl levels (fig. 5a). in contrast, exposure to
up to 2.0 amol/l  xxxd1815xxx  had no effect on the unmutated or
mutant forms of bcr-abl (fig. 5a, and data not shown). next,
we determined the effects of cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and

 xxxd1815xxx  on the levels of bcr-abl in baf3/bcr-abl, baf3/bcrable255k, and baf3/bcr-ablt315i cells. as compared with
treatment with either agent alone, combined treatment with
 xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  markedly depleted the levels of both
of the mutant forms of bcr-abl in baf3 cells. based on the
sensitivity to apoptosis with  xxxd1815xxx  noted in fig. 4a, we used
higher concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  in the combination against
baf3/bcr-able255k and baf3/bcr-ablt315i cells (fig. 5a).
cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , more than either
agent alone, also depleted the levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  and p-crkl in
baf3 cells with ectopic expression of unmutated bcr-abl or of
bcr-able255k or bcr-ablt315i (fig. 5a). the mechanism
underlying the striking decrease in p- xxxg2216xxx  levels without
any change in  xxxg2216xxx  levels is not obvious. however, it may be
that cotreatment with the high levels of  xxxd1815xxx  employed in
this experiment might render the upstream  xxxg2198xxx 
(responsible for phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx ) more susceptible
to depletion due to  xxxd3529xxx -mediated disruption of the
chaperone function of hsp90 for the  xxxg2198xxx . additionally, similar to the effects seen in k562 and lama-84 cells with
endogenous expression of bcr-abl, cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx 
and  xxxd1815xxx  versus treatment with either agent alone induced
significantly more apoptosis of baf3/bcr-abl cells (fig. 5b;
p < 0.05). notably, combined treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and
 xxxd1815xxx  was also more effective than either agent alone in
inducing apoptosis of baf3/bcr-ablt315i and baf3/bcrable255k cells (fig. 5c and d). the combination induced
apoptosis of f90% of baf3/bcr-able255k and 60% of baf3/
bcr-ablt315i cells (fig. 5c and d).

cotreatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  exerts superior
antileukemia activity against primary im-resistant cml
cells. we next determined the antileukemia effects of
 xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  against primary im-resistant
cml cells isolated from the peripheral blood and/or bone
marrow from 11 patients who had relapsed with im-resistant
cml blast crisis cells. two of these samples were documented to express bcr-ablt315i (samples 10 and 11). in the
remaining samples of im-resistant primary cml cells
(samples 1-9), due to inadequate sample size, the mutational
status of bcr-abl could not be determined. table 1 indicates
that in the samples 1 to 9,  xxxd1815xxx  induced loss of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. exposure to 2.0 amol/l
 xxxd3529xxx  alone also induced loss of cell viability in all of
the samples, including samples 10 and 11. notably, whereas
in samples 1 to 9, cotreatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx 
induced more loss of cell viability, in samples 10 and 11,
addition of  xxxd1815xxx  did not augment the loss of cell
viability due to treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  alone. one sample
(cml #4) yielded sufficient cells for immunoprecipitation of
bcr-abl to evaluate the effect of  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx 
on autophosphorylation and levels of bcr-abl, as well as on
levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  and p-crkl. as was observed in k562 cells,
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibited autophosphorylation of bcr-abl without
affecting bcr-abl levels (fig. 6a). treatment with  xxxd1815xxx 
also attenuated the levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  and p-crkl, with little
effect on  xxxg2216xxx  and crkl levels (fig. 6a). whereas exposure
of sample no. 4 cells to 2.0 amol/l  xxxd3529xxx  alone depleted
the levels of bcr-abl, p- xxxg2216xxx , and p-crkl, cotreatment with

fig. 4. treatment with  xxxd1815xxx  depletes bcr-abl activity and induces apoptosis of pro-b baf3 cells with ectopic expression of unmutated or mutant bcr-able255k but not
of bcr-ablt315i. a, baf3 cells with ectopic expression of either unmutated or mutant bcr-able255k or bcr-ablt315i were treated with the indicated concentrations of

duplicate; bars, se.

 xxxd1815xxx  (2 nmol/l) and  xxxd3529xxx  (2.0 amol/l) was even
more effective than treatment with either agent alone in
attenuating bcr-abl, p- xxxg2216xxx , and p-crkl (fig. 6b). these
findings are consistent with the increased lethality exerted
against sample no. 4 cells by the combination of  xxxd1815xxx 
(2 nmol/l) and  xxxd3529xxx  (2.0 amol/l; fig. 6b). treatment
with  xxxd1815xxx  was clearly less effective in depleting the levels
of p- xxxg2216xxx  in the primary versus cultured cml cells.
although the mechanisms underlying this disparity have
not been elucidated, it is possible that in primary cells,

 xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation may be mediated by the activity of
src as well as another  xxxg2198xxx (s), which is not
inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx .

discussion
previous reports have separately described the activity of the
pan- xxxd565xxx   xxxd3529xxx  and the dual abl/
src  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1815xxx  against bcr-abl-expressing human cml cells (25, 26, 35). here we show for the first

fig. 6. the effect of  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  on primary cml blast crisis cells.
a, primary cml cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx 
for 24 hours. bcr-abl was immunoprecipitated from the total cell lysates and
immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated bcr-abl. blots were stripped and
probed for total bcr-abl levels.western blot analysis was done for bcr-abl,
p- xxxg2216xxx ,  xxxg2216xxx , p-crkl, and crkl on total cell lysates from the same cells. the
levels of h-actin served as the loading control. b, cml blast crisis cells were treated
with  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd3529xxx  for 24 hours. after this,western blot analysis was
done for bcr-abl, p- xxxg2216xxx ,  xxxg2216xxx , p-crkl, and crkl on the total cell lysates. the
level of h-actin served as the loading control.

time that combined treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  is
significantly more active than either agent alone against human
cml cells with endogenous expression of the unmutated bcrabl. notably, the combination is also more active against baf3
cells with ectopic expression of bcr-abl or its mutant isoforms
bcr-able255k or bcr-ablt315i, as well as against im-resistant
human primary cml cells. treatment with pan-histone
deacetylase inhibitors, including  xxxd3529xxx , has been shown
to inhibit the activity of  xxxg1037xxx , which induces
the acetylation of hsp90 (39, 40, 45). this inhibits the atp
binding and chaperone function of hsp90, thereby disrupting
the association of hsp90 with its client proteins, including
bcr-abl, c-raf, and akt (37, 39). in turn, this promotes

clin cancer res 2006;12(19) october 1, 2006

polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the client
proteins (46).  xxxd3529xxx  has also been shown to downmodulate the levels of the bcl-2 and the inhibitor of apoptosis
family member proteins (35, 40). additionally, treatment with
 xxxd3529xxx  up-regulates the levels of bim, a protein induced by
the forkhead family of transcription factors that are repressed
by phosphorylation by akt (8, 10). by attenuating c-raf and in
turn inhibiting the activity of the erk, which is known to
phosphorylate bim and diminish its association with bcl-2 and
 xxxg251xxx ,  xxxd3529xxx  also promotes the proapoptotic effects of bim
(47, 48). collectively, these effects lower the threshold and
promote  xxxd3529xxx -induced apoptosis (49). the reported
findings also explain why cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  sensitizes
baf3/bcr-abl and human cml cells to  xxxd1815xxx -induced
apoptosis. that the combination of  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx 
induces more apoptosis of bcr-abl transformed cells is also
consistent with several previous reports where cotreatment with
a hydroxamic acid analogue  xxxd565xxx  and a
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, targeting a  xxxg2198xxx  that is a
bona fide hsp90 client protein (e.g., bcr-abl, her-2, and  xxxg801xxx ),
was shown to induce more apoptosis than treatment with
either agent alone (35, 50, 51). our findings show that, as
compared with treatment with  xxxd3529xxx  alone, cotreatment
with  xxxd1815xxx  mediates more depletion of unmutated or
mutant bcr-abl. although we do not have any experimental
evidence to clarify the mechanism underlying this effect, it is
possible that inhibition of bcr-abl activity and autophosphorylation may make it more susceptible to polyubiquitylation and
proteasomal degradation due to  xxxd3529xxx -mediated disruption of the chaperone function of hsp90.
recent studies have suggested that treatment with im may
be ineffective against cml stem cells (17), and acquired
resistance to im due to mutations in the bcr-abl kinase
domain is a common occurrence (12 – 15, 17). amplification
and increased expression of bcr-abl in cml progenitors may
also confer im resistance (12 – 14, 30).  xxxd1815xxx  is clearly a
more potent inhibitor than im of the unmutated bcr-abl
 xxxg2198xxx  activity, and  xxxd1815xxx  is also able to inhibit
most of the mutant forms of bcr-abl (23, 26 – 30).  xxxd3529xxx 
is shown here to not only deplete the levels of the unmutated
and mutant forms of bcr-abl but also induces apoptosis of
cml cells through bcr-abl-independent mechanisms. this is
important because im resistance may also be due to the
dependence of cml cells for their growth and survival on
signaling kinases other than bcr-abl (e.g., lyn or mitogenactivated protein kinase; refs. 16, 52, 53). therefore, the
combination of  xxxd3529xxx  with  xxxd1815xxx  has the potential of
overriding many, if not all, of the im resistance mechanisms
in cml progenitor cells. additionally, based on the multiple
mechanism of activity noted above, the combination may also
be able to override bcr-abl-independent and bcr-abl-dependent resistance mechanisms prevalent in the cml stem cells
(31, 36, 54). mutations in the kinase domain of bcr-abl
conferring im resistance fall into two main groups: those that
inhibit contact with im and those that prevent bcr-abl from
achieving the inactive conformation required for the binding
of im to bcr-abl. the point mutants bcr-able255k and bcrablt315i have been recognized as the important and
common examples of two groups of mutations that confer
clinical resistance to im (12 – 15). in the e255k mutation,
which is located within the atp-binding region (p-loop) of

 xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx  against cml

the kinase domain of bcr-abl, glycine is replaced by lysine
(12 – 14). this results in a significant decrease in the sensitivity
of bcr-able255k to im in the kinase assay and in conferring
im resistance on baf3/bcr-able255k cells (12 – 15). in bcrabl, thr315 makes a hydrogen bond contact with im, and a
single-nucleotide change (c to t) that results in a threonine
to isoleucine substitution at this residue has been shown to
confer high level of resistance not only to im but also to
 xxxd1815xxx  (13, 18, 19). recent preclinical studies have shown
that  xxxd1815xxx  is not only more potent in inhibiting
unmutated bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx  but is also active against
most of the mutant forms of bcr-abl, except bcr-ablt315i
(23 – 26). it is noteworthy that treatment with hsp90
inhibitors has been reported to induce depletion of the
mutant forms of bcr-abl and induce growth arrest and
apoptosis of im-resistant cml cells (42, 46). indeed, mutant
forms of bcr-abl seem to be more susceptible than unmutated
bcr-abl to depletion induced by the hsp90 inhibitors (42). a
similar observation has also been reported with respect to the
mutant versus unmutated forms of other hsp90 client proteins
(e.g.,  xxxg801xxx ; ref. 37).  xxxd3529xxx -mediated inhibition of the
chaperone function of hsp90 may be responsible for the
depletion of the bcr-able255k and bcr-ablt315i levels in
 xxxd1815xxx -treated baf3/bcr-able255k and baf3/bcr-ablt315i
cells, respectively.
in early clinical trials,  xxxd1815xxx  has exhibited promising level
of clinical activity in im-resistant cml (28, 30). however, a
substantial proportion of patients fail to achieve cytogenetic
complete remission, especially in patients with more advanced
phases of cml (28, 30, 55). cells from these patients may
harbor additional chromosomal abnormalities and genetic
perturbations that often involve the recruitment of corepressors
and histone deacetylase activity. this can potentially repress
genes involved in differentiation and apoptosis (1, 31, 56, 57).
cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  may override these mechanisms
and sensitize leukemia cells to  xxxd1815xxx -induced growth arrest
and apoptosis, as was reported in the primary cml blast crisis
cells (35). additionally, cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  and
 xxxd1815xxx  not only attenuates bcr-abl but also depletes the
downstream pro-growth and pro-survival signaling molecules,
including p-akt, p- xxxg1369xxx /2, and p- xxxg2216xxx . accordingly,  xxxd3529xxx  may be exerting a ‘‘longitudinal’’ two-step inhibition of the
signaling initiated by bcr-abl, thus augmenting the growth
inhibitory and apoptotic activity of  xxxd1815xxx  against cml blast
crisis cells. a similar effect may explain the superior activity of

the combination of a  xxxg1478xxx  inhibitor
and im against cml cells (58). cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx 
and  xxxd1815xxx  also caused more inhibition of p- xxxg2216xxx , which
was associated with more attenuation of the  xxxg2216xxx  target gene
products  xxxg251xxx  and c-myc (3 – 5). bcl-2 family members have
been shown to act in a complementary manner to promote bcrabl-mediated induction of leukemia (59, 60). additionally, our
findings show that  xxxd3529xxx -mediated induction of p21 was
blocked by cotreatment with  xxxd1815xxx . this is consistent with
previous reports, which have indicated that p21 induction
decreases apoptosis induced by  xxxd565xxx ,
and interruption of  xxxd565xxx  – induced p21
potentiates apoptosis due to treatment with histone deacetylase
inhibitor (61). collectively, more dramatic inhibitory effects on
several pro-growth and pro-survival signaling molecules may
also contribute to the synergistic apoptotic effects of the
combination of  xxxd3529xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  in the cultured and
primary cml cells. because these findings have not been
verified in vivo, the clinical significance of these observations
remains uncertain.
in the present studies,  xxxd3529xxx  is shown to sensitize baf3/
bcr-able255k and baf3/bcr-ablt315i cells to clinically achievable levels of  xxxd1815xxx . because, at these levels,  xxxd1815xxx  is
able to inhibit the bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx  activity of the mutant
bcr-able255k, it is likely that cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx 
enhances this activity of  xxxd1815xxx  not only by depleting the
levels of bcr-able255k but also through other downstream
mechanisms described above. however, the structural basis for
how cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  leads to increased activity of
relatively high levels of  xxxd1815xxx  (2.0 amol/l) against the
contact inhibitory mutant bcr-ablt315i is not entirely clear. it
is also possible that  xxxd3529xxx  augments bcr-abl-independent
growth inhibitory and cytotoxic mechanisms of  xxxd1815xxx 
against bcr-ablt315i-expressing cells. however, further studies
are needed to characterize these mechanisms. alternatively, it is
conceivable that  xxxd3529xxx -mediated acetylation and inhibition of hsp90 chaperone function for bcr-abl affects its
conformation in a manner that allows higher concentrations
of  xxxd1815xxx  to interact with and inhibit bcr-ablt315i (24, 25).
in a recent report, the non-atp-competitive bcr-abl kinase
inhibitor on012380 was shown to inhibit the activity of bcrablt315i (62). it would also be important to determine
whether cotreatment with  xxxd3529xxx  would further augment
the activity of on012380 against cml cells expressing bcrablt315i.
