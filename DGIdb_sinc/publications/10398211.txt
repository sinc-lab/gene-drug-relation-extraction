altered vasoreactivity to  xxxg99xxx  in experimental diabetic neuropathy: role of  xxxd2738xxx .  we evaluated the effects of  xxxg99xxx  and an  xxxg36xxx  inhibitor ( xxxd1694xxx ) on nerve blood flow (nbf) and electrophysiology in control and diabetic rats. when applied locally to the sciatic nerve, the dose-response curve of  xxxg99xxx  was more potent in experimental diabetic neuropathy (edn) than control rats. no difference existed in plasma  xxxg99xxx  levels between edn and controls. the rats were given typical rat pellets or pellets treated with 10 mg/kg per day  xxxd1694xxx  for 4 weeks. diabetes caused a significant reduction in nbf, nerve conduction velocity, and compound muscle action potential (cmap) amplitudes. nbf was significantly increased in diabetic rats supplemented with  xxxd1694xxx  diet, and nerve conduction velocity and amplitudes of the cmap were also improved after 4 weeks on this diet. direct application 10(-3) mol/l  xxxd1694xxx  on sciatic nerve did not increase nbf in normal and edn rats. we topically applied the  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos) inhibitor, ng-nitro-l-arginine, on sciatic nerve and observed reduced inhibition of nbf in edn, which was correctable with a  xxxd1694xxx  diet. these results suggest that diabetic neuropathy may have an increasing vasopressor action with  xxxg99xxx  and this is likely to be the mechanism of nos inhibition.  xxxg99xxx -converting enzyme inhibitors may have potential in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.
