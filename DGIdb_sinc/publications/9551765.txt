 xxxd1842xxx , a putative anxiolytic drug, is a serotonin  xxxg1115xxx 
 xxxd1422xxx  but fails to induce  xxxg1115xxx  down-regulation
received: 24 october 1996 / final version: 8 august 1997

abstract  xxxd1842xxx  (egis-3886) is a novel anxiolytic agent that binds with high a¦nity to 5-ht2a / 2c
receptors. the interactions of  xxxd1842xxx  with the
serotonin  xxxg1115xxx  were characterized further
using receptor phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays and
receptor autoradiography.  xxxd1842xxx  antagonized
 xxxg1115xxx  mediated 5-ht-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis with an ic50 value of 168 nm.
 xxxd1842xxx  also decreased basal phosphoinositide
hydrolysis by up to 33 % (ec50 = 93 nm) in a physiological system in the choroid plexus, suggesting that
 xxxd1842xxx  possesses  xxxd1422xxx  properties at
this receptor. administration of single doses of
0.5 mg / kg and 10 mg / kg resulted in a maximal 5-ht2c
receptor occupancy of up to 45 % and 79 %, respectively, in the choroid plexus. chronic (14 days) treatment with 0.5 mg / kg or 10 mg / kg  xxxd1842xxx  did
not alter [125i]doi (agonist) or [3h]mesulergine (antagonist) binding to 5-ht2c receptors in the choroid
plexus compared to saline-treated controls, as determined by quantitative receptor autoradiography. in
comparison, the e¤ects of  xxxd1842xxx  on 5-ht2a
binding characteristics and receptor occupancy were
also studied.  xxxd1842xxx  treatment resulted in 5ht2a receptor occupancy of up to 78 %, but no
signiþcant e¤ect of chronic treatment on  xxxg1113xxx  agonist binding levels was found. in conclusion,

these data indicate that  xxxd1842xxx  is a  xxxg1115xxx   xxxd1422xxx  and occupies 5-ht2c receptors during treatment, and that chronic treatment with
 xxxd1842xxx  does not lead to  xxxg1115xxx  downregulation.

introduction
the  xxxg1113xxx  subfamily has recently attracted
interest as a possible target for new anxiolytic drug
development. this approach is based on observations
that drugs acting at these receptors have anxiogenic or
anxiolytic properties. for instance, the anxiogenic
properties of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp) in rats
(kennett et al. 1989), pigeons (gleeson et al. 1989) and
humans (see kahn et al. 1988; handley and mcblane
1993; kennett 1993) have been attributed to its agonist
activity at 5-ht2-like receptors, mainly the 5-ht2c
(kennett 1992; gibson et al. 1994). one of the novel
putative anxiolytic drugs with antiserotonergic properties is  xxxd1842xxx  (gacsályi et al. 1988, 1996). it
has relatively high a¦nity for 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c
receptors, intermediate a¦nity for sigma receptors and
low or very low a¦nity for many other neurotransmitter receptors, including other serotonin receptors
subtypes as well as dopamine, adrenergic, gaba,
cck, benzodiazepine, histamine and nmda receptors.  xxxd1842xxx  demonstrates anxiolytic-like activity in vogels test, social interaction, two-compartment
box and marble burying tests and does not reduce
motor activity at the established anxiolytic doses
(gacsályi et al. 1988, submitted). in the present study,
we investigated the interactions of  xxxd1842xxx 
with the 5-ht2c receptors to characterize further the

100

interactions of  xxxd1842xxx  with the receptor, to þnd
out if  xxxd1842xxx  occupies 5-ht2c receptors after
single-dose administration and whether chronic treatment with  xxxd1842xxx  alters the quantity of 5-ht2c
agonist or antagonist binding sites in the rat brain.
clozapine, known to induce 5-ht2c down-regulation,
was included as a positive control (hietala et al.
1992).

materials and methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats (harlan sprague-dawley, ind., usa)
weighing 200250 g were used. rats were housed under standard
laboratory conditions (temperature 21°c; humidity 55 ± 5 % ; lights
on from 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m.). standard pelleted foor and tap
water were available ad libitum. experiments were conducted
according to the european convention for the protection of
vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientiþc
purposes (finnish statute book 1360 / 90).

drug treatments
 xxxd1842xxx  (egis pharmaceuticals, hungary) was diluted in
0.9 % saline and the solution was emulsiþed with a drop of
tween 80. clozapine ( xxxd1733xxx , 25 mg / ml; sandoz pharma ag,
basle, switzerland) was used as commercially available ampoules.
in the chronic treatment experiment, four groups of rats (n = 6 in
each group) received sc injections of clozapine (25 mg / kg),
 xxxd1842xxx  (0.5 or 10 mg / kg) or an equal volume (1 ml / kg) of
saline (with tween 80 added) once a day for 14 days. in the receptor occupancy experiment, rats were given a single dose of  xxxd1842xxx  (0.5 or 10 mg / kg), clozapine (25 mg / kg), or an equal
volume (1 ml / kg) of saline. doses refer to the free base of a given
drug.

brain dissection
rats were decapitated 68 h (chronic treatment experiment) or 1 h,
2 h, 4 h, 8 h and 24 h (occupancy experiment) after the last drug
injection, and the brains were immediately dissected, frozen on dry
ice and stored at [80°c for later use. coronal brain sections were
cut on a cryostat ([16°c) at 18 µm thickness and thaw-mounted
onto gelatin-coated glass slides. the thawed sections were then dried
at room temperature for several hours and subsequently stored at
[80°c until used for receptor autoradiography.

 xxxg1115xxx  mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay
5-ht-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was measured in rat
choroid plexus as previously described (kuoppamäki et al. 1993).
choroid plexi were rapidly dissected out after decapitation and a
single choroid plexus (about 0.51.0 mg wet weight) was placed into
5 ml krebs-bicarbonate (krb) bu¤er (118 mm nacl, 5.0 mm kcl,
1.3 mm cacl2, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2 mm kh2po4, 25 mm
nahco3) containing 10 mm glucose. krb bu¤er was changed
once before incubation for 1 h at 37°c in a shaking water bath with
two intermediate changes of bu¤er. the samples were subsequently
labeled with 1 µci of [3h]myo-inositol (new england nuclear,
boston, mass., usa) for 90 min in the presence of o2 / co2(95 : 5).

10 µm  xxxd2850xxx  and 10 mm lithium were added and the incubation was continued for 15 min. the antagonists, if present, were
added at the same time with  xxxd2850xxx  and lithium. thereafter,
5-ht or an equal volume of bu¤er was added to give a þnal volume of 300 µl and the samples were incubated for 30 min. the reaction was stopped by addition of 940 µl chloroform / methanol
(1 : 2 v / v). after vortexing and standing for 15 min, 300 µl chloroform and 300 µl deionized h2o were added and the tubes were vortexed and centrifuged. a portion (750 µl) of the upper aqueous
phase containing water soluble inositol phosphates was removed
and applied to a column of dowex-1 anion-exchange resin in the
formate form. free inositol was eluted with 10 ml of 10 mm  xxxd2360xxx , followed by 10 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate / 60 mm
ammonium formate to elute glyceroinositol phosphate. inositol
monophosphate (ip) was eluted with 10 ml of 200 mm ammonium
formate / 0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx . the þrst 5 ml of inositol monophosphate was eluted directly into scintillation vials, while the additional
5 ml was discarded. optiphase hisafe 3 (lkb wallac,
loughborough, uk) was used as a scintillation ßuid and the ic50
values were calculated with the software graphpad inplot 4.1
(graphpad software, san diego, calif., usa).

receptor autoradiography
for determination of 5-ht2c antagonist binding (chronic treatment
experiments), slides were þrst preincubated in 170 mm tris-hcl
bu¤er at room temperature for 15 min, then incubated in 170 mm
tris-hcl plus 5 nm [3h]mesulergine (amersham, little chalfont,
uk) and 100 nm spiperone at room temperature for 120 min. nonspeciþc binding was determined in the presence of 5 µm  xxxd2621xxx . slides were subsequently washed in 0°c 170 mm tris-hcl
(2 × 10 min) and dipped in ice-cold deionized water. for determination of  xxxg1115xxx  agonist binding, dried, room-temperature slides were þrst preincubated in a 50 mm tris-hcl bu¤er
containing 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx  and 0.1 % (w / v) bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa) at room temperature for 10 min to remove endogenous
serotonin. slides were then incubated in a similar bu¤er plus
200 pm (±)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-[125i]iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane
([125i]doi, new england nuclear, boston, mass., usa) and
100 nm spiperone (to block 5-ht2a receptors) at room temperature for 60 min. non-speciþc binding was deþned in the presence
of 1 µm  xxxd2621xxx . after incubation, the slides were rinsed in
a similar ice-cold bu¤er (2 × 10 min) and dipped in ice-cold deionized water to remove salt. for determination of  xxxg1113xxx 
binding, the 5-ht2c agonist binding protocol was employed with
the following exceptions : spiperone was excluded from the incubation bu¤er, and non-speciþc binding was determined in the presence of 1 µm  xxxd2419xxx  instead of 5 µm  xxxd2621xxx . thoroughly
dried slides and standards were apposed to x-ray þlm for 30 h
([125i]doi autoradiography) or 21 days ([3h]mesulergine autoradiography) at +4°c in an x-ray þlm cassette wrapped in plastic for
protection from humidity.

analysis of autoradiographic images
autoradiographic images were analyzed on a computer-assisted
image analyzer (camera, hamamatsu c3077, hamamatsu
photonics, k.k., hamamatsu city, japan; software, mcid,
imaging research, st catharines, ontario, canada). for each sample, analysis began by digitizing an image of the total ligand binding. image densities were then linearized by calibration against the
densities produced by the known radioactivities in the standards
(american radiolabeled chemicals, st louis, miss., usa). in the
 xxxg1115xxx  autoradiograms, total binding was considered
speciþc, as non-speciþc binding produced a negligible signal on the
þlm. in the 5-ht2a autoradiograms, the non-speciþc signal was
subtracted from the total signal on adjacent sections.

101
receptor occupancy measurement
for  xxxg1115xxx  occupancy experiments, the above-described
autoradiography protocol was used with the following exceptions
to achieve optimal conditions for this type of assay: preincubation
was omitted to maintain the in vivo drug concentrations, the slides
were incubated for 15 min and subsequently wiped o¤ into scintillation vials. for  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy experiments, 4 nm
[3h] xxxd2419xxx  (new england nuclear, boston, mass., usa) was
used as antagonist radioligand and the assays were carried out similarly to the 5-ht2c occupancy experiments, with the exception of
the incubation time which, in the 5-ht2a assay, was 20 min. in
both receptor occupancy assays, for each section, non-speciþc binding was determined for an adjacent section and then subtracted
from total binding. the radioactivity in the scintillation vials was
measured by beta-counting (wallac lkb 1219 rackbeta, finland)
using optifluor-o (packard, zurich, switzerland) scintillation ßuid
at 50 % e¦ciency, except in the  xxxg1113xxx  binding assay where
optiphase hisafe 3 (lkb wallac, loughborough, uk) scintillation ßuid was used. computer processing of the binding data
[ebda (equilibrium binding data analysis) / ligand] was performed as previously described (hietala et al. 1990).

statistical analysis
statistical analysis of the data was carried out by one-way analysis of variance followed by tukeys test for post-hoc analyses. p
value lower than 0.05 was considered signiþcant.

results of phosphoinositide hydrolysis studies in
choroid plexus are summarized in fig. 1a and b.
100 nm 5-ht stimulated the accumulation of inositol
monophosphate (ip) 4- to 5-fold over basal values of
about 5000 dpm.  xxxd1842xxx  antagonized 5-ht
(100 nm)-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, with
an ic50 value of 168 nm (fig. 1a).  xxxd1842xxx  did
not stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis itself, but
inhibited basal pi hydrolysis by up to 33% with an ec50
value of 90 nm, indicating that  xxxd1842xxx  is a
 xxxg1115xxx   xxxd1422xxx  (fig. 1b).

however, a trend towards reduced 5-ht2a binding
following  xxxd1842xxx  treatment was observed; binding was decreased by 21 % (p = 0.074) and 16 %
(p = 0.23) by treatment with 0.5 mg / kg and 10 mg / kg,
respectively.

the results of autoradiography are summarized in
fig. 2. chronic treatment with either dose (10 or
0.5 mg / kg) of  xxxd1842xxx  did not alter [125i]doi or
[3h]mesulergine binding to 5-ht2c receptors in the
choroid plexus. in comparison, clozapine treatment
decreased [125i]doi binding to 5-ht2c receptors in
the choroid plexus by 32 % (p = 0.012) and [3h]mesulergine binding by 53 % (p < 0.001). the binding of
[125i]doi to 5-ht2a receptors in layer iv of the cerebral cortex was not signiþcantly altered by chronic
treatment with either dose regimen of  xxxd1842xxx ,

of 5-ht2c receptors.

discussion
 xxxd1842xxx  is a predicted anxiolytic drug undergoing further research in early human studies.
 xxxd1842xxx  binds to the rat  xxxg1115xxx  with a
ki value of 27 nm for inhibition of [3h]mesulergine

binding, and to the rat  xxxg1113xxx , with a ki value
of 11 nm for inhibition of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding
(gacsályi et al., submitted). the present results demonstate that  xxxd1842xxx  is a  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist with an ic50 value of 168 nm for inhibition
of 5-ht stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis.
 xxxd1842xxx  also inhibited basal pi hydrolysis in the
choroid plexus, indicating that it possesses  xxxd1422xxx  properties at this receptor. other inverse agonists
of the  xxxg1115xxx  include the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (kuoppamäki et al. 1994), spiperone,
mesulergine,  xxxd2419xxx  and the antidepressant
 xxxd2637xxx  (barker et al. 1994). the signiþcance of
inverse agonism is unclear (for review, see milligan
et al. 1995), but reduction of constitutive activity by
inverse agonists may contribute to their e¤ects when,
for instance, increased constitutive activity results in
disease (e.g. shenker et al. 1993). consistent with our
previous studies on other  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists
(kuoppamäki et al. 1995, pälvimäki et al. 1996), the
e¦cacy of  xxxd1842xxx  in displacing antagonist radioligand was 5- to 10-fold higher than its inhibition
potency of pi hydrolysis.
the fact that a compound has high a¦nity for its
receptor in vitro is not alone indicative of the functional signiþcance of this interaction in vivo upon treatment. the ligand must pass through the blood-brain
barrier and reach its target in su¦cient concentrations
to interact directly with its receptor. in the present
study, we treated rats with two di¤erent doses of  xxxd1842xxx  and determined the consequent in vivo
5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  occupancies in cortical
and choroid plexus coronal sections, respectively, at
various time points.
 xxxd1842xxx  caused marked occupancy of both
5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors in vivo after administration of doses that are active in anxiolytic tests in
rodents (0.5 and 10 mg / kg), suggesting that antagonism at these receptors may be involved in its anxiolytic-like properties. the behavioral e¤ects of mcpp
have been suggested to be mediated by a combination
of its agonist activity at 5-ht2c receptors and antagonist activity at 5-ht2a receptors (fiorella et al. 1995).
moreover, selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists have
been reported not to have an anxiolytic e¤ect nor to
block the anxiogenic action of mcpp (gardner 1986;
kennett 1992; gibson et al. 1994). therefore, the 5ht2c receptor seems a likely candidate for mediating
the anxiolytic activity of  xxxd1842xxx . on the other
hand, as the anti-anxiety models are not categorically
selective of drugs targetting 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c
receptors (for review, see griebel 1995), the 5-ht2a
receptor cannot be ruled out in this context.
as a rule, chronic treatment with agonists or antagonists of the 5-ht2a / 2c receptors leads to receptor
down-regulation (peroutka and snyder 1980; sandersbush and breeding 1988,1990; pranzatelli 1991; hietala
et al. 1992; barker and sanders-bush 1993; pranzatelli

103

et al. 1993). however, many potent antagonists fail to
elicit this e¤ect (e.g. kuoppamäki et al. 1994) and some
have an opposite e¤ect (rinaldi-carmona et al. 1993;
rocha et al. 1994). furthermore, the regulation of 5ht2c receptors can be region-speciþc (e.g. rocha et al.
1994) and may be brought about by indirect drug e¤ects
(laakso et al. 1996). in the present study, we found
that chronic treatment with  xxxd1842xxx  did not alter
5-ht2a or  xxxg1115xxx  agonist or antagonist binding characteristics in the rat brain, whereas the reference drug clozapine elicited a marked decrease of both
agonist and antagonist binding to 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c
receptors. the e¤ects of clozapine are in accordance
with previous studies, and thus validate the methods
used in the present investigation (kuoppamäki et al.
1994).
altered receptor gene expression is apparently not
involved in drug-induced  xxxg1115xxx  regulation
(roth et al. 1990; barker and sanders-bush 1993), but
phosphorylation of the  xxxg1115xxx  may be necessary for receptor desensitization. increased basal
phosphorylation leads to  xxxg1115xxx  desensitization (westphal et al. 1995) and dephosphorylation of
the receptor may counteract protein kinase c-mediated
desensitization (boddeke et al. 1993). therefore, direct
e¤ects on receptor phosphorylation might account for
the ability of certain drugs to induce  xxxg1115xxx 
down-regulation. however,  xxxd2637xxx  has no e¤ect on
 xxxg1115xxx  phosphorylation on its own, although
it does block the serotonin-induced increase (westphal
et al. 1995). whether clozapine has direct e¤ects on
 xxxg1115xxx  phosphorylation is unknown. since
the inverse agonists clozapine and  xxxd2637xxx  induce
 xxxg1115xxx  down-regulation in vivo (roth et al.
1991; kuoppamäki et al. 1994; rocha et al. 1995), it
might be suggested that inverse agonism is predictive
of  xxxg1115xxx  down-regulation. however,
labrecque et al. (1995), using  xxxg1115xxx   tranfected cells, found that inverse agonism is not predictive of the ability of a compound to cause 5-ht2c
receptor down-regulation. furthermore, the present
data provide evidence that marked receptor occupancy
in vivo during chronic treatment by an  xxxd1422xxx 
is not su¦cient to induce  xxxg1115xxx  down-regulation in the choroid plexus.
since the occupancy of 5-ht2c receptors by  xxxd1842xxx  is relatively short-lived, it might be conceived
that in order to see down-regulation, a more sustained
occupancy should be acquired. indeed, the present data
show that the 5-ht2c occupancy after administration
of 25 mg /kg clozapine is more persistent compared to
that after  xxxd1842xxx  administration. clozapine
25 mg /kg was, however, included solely as a potitive
control in this study, and no attempt was made to þnd
doses resulting in similar receptor occupancy. in a previous study, we found that the 10 mg /kg clozapine dose
administered once daily for 14 days was su¦cient to
cause a 49 % down-regulation of the  xxxg1115xxx ,

as measured by methods identical to those used in
the present investigation (kuoppamäki et al. 1994).
baldessarini et al. (1993) found that the elimination
half-life of clozapine in the rat brain is 1.5 h, and that
12 h after administration of a single dose of 10 mg /kg
ip, neither clozapine nor its main metabolites were
detectable in rat brain. this suggests that after 10 mg /kg
clozapine, the receptor occupancy may be shorter-lived.
we propose that the di¤erential regulation of the
 xxxg1115xxx  by clozapine and  xxxd1842xxx  is
unlikely to be explained by pharmacokinetics, but
further occupancy determinations and perhaps more
frequent administration of  xxxd1842xxx  upon chronic
treatment are needed to conclude on this matter.
in summary, the principle þndings of the present
investigation are the following: 1) the putative anxiolytic  xxxd1842xxx  is a  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist with
 xxxd1422xxx  properties; 2) single-dose administration of  xxxd1842xxx  at anxiolytic doses results in
marked in vivo occupancy of 5-ht2c (and 5-ht2a)
receptors in the rat brain; 3) chronic treatment (14 days,
once daily, sc) with  xxxd1842xxx  (10 mg / kg and
0.5 mg / kg) does not alter the quantity of  xxxg1115xxx  agonist or antagonist radioligand binding in the rat
choroid plexus.
