introduction
 xxxd365xxx  ( xxxd365xxx ) is a compound currently under
investigation for the treatment of depression and schizophrenia. antipsychotic medications of the first and second generations are efficacious antagonists at dopamine (da) d2
receptors. indeed,  xxxg656xxx  antagonism is an effective
strategy for treatment of positive symptoms in schizophrenia
(seeman and lee, 1975; rao and remington, 2013). however,
it is accompanied by unwanted motor side effects leading to
extrapyramidal symptoms, at least in part by decreasing
dopaminergic transmission in the striatum (glazer, 2000;
kapur et al., 2000). these side effects are dampened when
some of the data in this study were presented as follows: oosterhof ca, el
mansari m, and blier p (2014) in vivo electrophysiological characterization of

on norepinephrine neuronal firing (ed50 5 110 mg/kg), demonstrating 5-ht2a antagonistic action.  xxxd365xxx  reversed the inhibitory effect of the da agonist apomorphine on vta da neurons
(ed50 5 61 mg/kg), whereas it was ineffective when administered
alone, indicating partial agonistic action on d2 receptors. compared with aripiprazole, which significantly inhibited the firing
activity of vta da neurons,  xxxd365xxx  displayed less efficacy at
d2 receptors. in the hippocampus,  xxxd365xxx  acted as a full
agonist at 5-ht1a receptors on pyramidal neurons. furthermore, it
increased 5-ht release by terminal a2-adrenergic heteroceptor but
not 5-ht1b autoreceptor antagonism. in the lateral geniculate
nucleus,  xxxd365xxx  displayed a1b-adrenoceptor antagonistic
action. taken together, these results provide insight into the in vivo
action of  xxxd365xxx  on monoamine targets relevant in the
treatment of depression and schizophrenia.

combined with antagonism of the serotonin (5-ht) receptor
subtype 5-ht2a, a defining pharmacologic characteristic of
second-generation antipsychotics (stockmeier et al., 1993)
that may be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of both
schizophrenia and mood disorders (blier and szabo, 2005;
kuroki et al., 2008).
most second-generation antipsychotics have higher in vitro
affinity for 5-ht2a than d2 receptors;  xxxd365xxx  and
aripiprazole are different in this regard (5-ht2a ki 5 0.47 and
4.7 nm and d2 ki 5 0.30 and 0.87 nm, respectively; maeda
et al., 2014b). whereas most other atypical antipsychotics are
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists, in vitro data indicate that  xxxd365xxx  is a d2 partial agonist with lower intrinsic activity at
d2 receptors than aripiprazole (maeda et al., 2014b). partial
 xxxg656xxx  agonism is thought to have a buffering action on
da neurotransmission by stimulating d2 receptors under low
da conditions, while dampening their activation when da
levels are high (burris et al., 2002). indeed, in vivo systemic
administration of aripiprazole has been shown to decrease the
firing activity of ventral tegmental area (vta) da neurons to

abstract
 xxxd365xxx , a compound sharing structural molecular characteristics with aripiprazole, is currently under investigation for the
treatment of schizophrenia and depression. using electrophysiologic techniques, the present study assessed the in vivo action
of  xxxd365xxx  on serotonin (5-ht) receptor subtypes 5-ht1a,
5-ht1b, and 5-ht2a; dopamine (da) d2 autoreceptors, and a1and a2-adrenergic receptors. in addition, the effects on 5-ht1a
autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn) and d2 autoreceptors in the ventral tegmental area (vta) were compared
with those of aripiprazole, an agent in wide clinical use. in the drn,
 xxxd365xxx  completely inhibited the firing of 5-ht neurons via
5-ht1a agonism and was more potent than aripiprazole (ed50 5
230 and 700 mg/kg, respectively). in the locus coeruleus,
 xxxd365xxx  reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential
 xxxg1113xxx  agonist doi (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine)

materials and methods
animals. experiments were carried out in male sprague-dawley
rats (charles river laboratories, st. constant, qc, canada) weighing
275–325 g housed under standard laboratory conditions (12-hour
light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum). in vivo extracellular
unitary recordings were carried out in chloral hydrate–anesthetized
rats (400 mg/kg i.p.) that were mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus.
body temperature was maintained at 37°c throughout the experiment utilizing a thermistor-controlled heating pad. if applicable, prior
to the electrophysiologic recordings, a catheter was inserted in
a lateral tail vein for systemic intravenous injection of pharmacologic
agents. at the end of experiments, animals were euthanized by
a lethal dose of chloral hydrate (4% solution i.p.). all experiments
were carried out in accordance with the canadian council on animal
care and the local animal care committee (university of ottawa,
institute of mental health research, ottawa, on, canada).
compounds.  xxxd365xxx  (200 mg/kg; maeda et al., 2014b),
aripiprazole (200 mg/kg), and the da agonist apomorphine (40 mg/kg)
were dissolved in a 0.5% lactic acid solution in distilled water; the ph
of the solution was adjusted to 4.5 by addition of naoh. the preferential  xxxg1113xxx  agonist doi (100 mg/kg), the a2-adrenoreceptor
agonist clonidine (10 and 400 mg/kg), and the  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist
way 100.635 (n -[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n (2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide) were dissolved in distilled water.
the selective a1a-adrenoreceptor antagonist (wetzel et al., 1995) snap
5089 (5-[[[3-(4,4-diphenyl-1-piperidinyl)propyl]amino]carbonyl]1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(4-nitrophenyl)- xxxd2715xxx 
methyl ester hydrochloride; 1 mg/kg) was dissolved in 20% b-cyclodextrin
in distilled water.  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole were provided by
lundbeck a/s (valby, denmark); all other compounds were purchased from sigma-aldrich (oakville, on, canada).
in vivo electrophysiologic recordings. extracellular recordings of neurons in the vta, drn, and locus coeruleus (lc) were carried
out with a single-barrel glass micropipette (stoelting, spencerville, md)
preloaded with 2 m nacl and with impedance between 2 and 6 mv.
neurons in the cornu ammonis layer 3 (ca3) region of the hippocampus
and lateral geniculate nucleus (lgn) were recorded with a five-barrel
micropipette (impedances: central barrel, 2–5 mv; side barrels, 20–30
mv). the central barrel, used for unitary recordings, and one side
barrel, used for automatic current balancing, were filled with 2 m nacl;
the other barrels were filled with  xxxd365xxx  (1.2 mm in distilled
water and 0.5% lactic acid, ph 4.5), 5-ht creatinine sulfate (10 mm in
0.2 m nacl, ph 4), ne bitartrate (10 mm in 0.2 m nacl, ph 4), or
 xxxd3068xxx  (1.5 mm in 0.2 m nacl, ph 4). 5-ht and ne were
ejected as cations and retained with a negative current;  xxxd3068xxx 
and  xxxd365xxx  were ejected as anions (23 to 13 na and 255 to
290 na, respectively) and retained with a positive current.
recording of drn 5-ht neurons. putative 5-ht neurons were
recorded by positioning single-barrel glass micropipettes at the
following coordinates (in millimeters from l): anterior/posterior
(ap), 1.0–1.2; mediolateral (ml), 0; and dorsal/ventral (dv), 5.0–7.0.
at these coordinates, only neurons with a bi- or triphasic extracellular
waveform with a long-duration (0.8–1.2 milliseconds) positive phase and
regular firing in the range of 0.8–2 hz were recorded (vandermaelen and
aghajanian, 1983).
recording of lc ne neurons. ne neurons were recorded by
positioning single-barrel glass micropipettes at the following coordinates (in millimeters from l): ap, 21.0 to 21.2; ml, 1.0–1.3; and
dv, 5.0–7.0. ne neurons were identified using the following criteria:
regular firing rate (1–3 hz), a long duration (0.8–1.2 milliseconds) of
the rising phase of the action potential, and a brisk excitatory response
followed by a short period of inhibition (∼1 second) in reaction to a
nociceptive pinch of the contralateral hind paw (vandermaelen and
aghajanian, 1983). to test the effect of  xxxd365xxx  on 5-ht2a
receptors, ne neurons were inhibited by the preferential  xxxg1113xxx  agonist doi (100 mg/kg i.v.) (szabo and blier, 2001). following a
60-second inhibition period, cumulative doses of  xxxd365xxx  (50 and

∼70% of baseline, whereas complete inhibition of these neurons by the da receptor agonist apomorphine was reversed by
aripiprazole to a similar degree (dahan et al., 2009). in
contrast, acute haloperidol and clozapine administration
increases firing of vta da neurons by d2 autoreceptor
antagonism (hand et al., 1987). despite a different action on
d2 autoreceptors,  xxxd365xxx  improved behavioral measures
predictive of antipsychotic efficacy, such as apomorphineinduced stereotypy and the conditioned avoidance response
(maeda et al., 2014a). furthermore,  xxxd365xxx  reduced
head twitches induced by the preferential  xxxg1113xxx 
agonist doi (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) and restored
phencyclidine-induced cognitive impairment to a greater extent
than the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist m100907 [(r)-(1)-a-(2,3dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-pipidinemethanol],
indicating in vivo antagonistic action at 5-ht2a receptors
(maeda et al., 2014a).
aripiprazole and  xxxd365xxx  are in vitro  xxxg1108xxx 
agonists (ki 5 1.3 and 0.12 nm, respectively; maeda et al.,
2014b), a relevant pharmacologic characteristic in the treatment of mood disorders and schizophrenia (blier and ward,
2003; newman-tancredi, 2010). for aripiprazole, in vivo
electrophysiology studies showed acute agonistic action at
5-ht1a autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn; stark
et al., 2007; dahan et al., 2009). interestingly, these autoreceptors were desensitized after only 2 days of aripiprazole administration (chernoloz et al., 2009). desensitization of 5-ht1a
receptors could increase 5-ht neurotransmission, a common
effect of long-term antidepressant administration thought to
be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of mood disorders
(blier and el mansari, 2013). the recent demonstration that the
restorative effect of both acute and chronic  xxxd365xxx  on
impaired cognitive function was lost by  xxxg1108xxx  blockade further suggests in vivo  xxxg1108xxx  agonism by this
compound (maeda et al., 2014a; yoshimi et al., 2014).
antagonism of a-adrenoceptors is a pharmacologic feature
that may have therapeutic implications for schizophrenia and
depression (fawcett and barkin, 1998; arnsten, 2004; marcus
et al., 2010). in vitro,  xxxd365xxx  has selective affinity for
a1b-adrenoceptors (ki 5 0.17 nm) over a1a (ki 5 3.8 nm) and
a1d (ki 5 2.6 nm) subtypes (maeda et al., 2014b). furthermore, it may have antagonistic properties on a2-adrenoceptors (maeda et al., 2014b), a pharmacologic characteristic
known to increase neurotransmission of norepinephrine (ne)
(ghanbari et al., 2011; chernoloz et al., 2012) and 5-ht
(mongeau et al., 1993; haddjeri et al., 1998) by blockade
of terminal a2-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroceptors,
respectively.
compared with aripiprazole,  xxxd365xxx  has a 3- to
4-fold-higher in vitro affinity for the 5-ht transporter (sert;
ic50 5 29 nm) and ne transporter (net; ic50 5 140 nm)
(maeda et al., 2014b). blockade of these transporters is known
to enhance 5-ht and ne neurotransmission (el mansari
et al., 2005; chernoloz et al., 2012). as agents that block these
transporters are currently first-line treatments for mood
disorders, monoamine reuptake–blocking properties could
contribute to the clinical efficacy of  xxxd365xxx .
to complement and extend insight into its action on therapeutically relevant targets, the present study used electrophysiologic techniques to determine the in vivo activity of
 xxxd365xxx  on 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b, 5-ht2a, and d2 receptors,
on a1- and a2-adrenoreceptors, and on the sert and net.

acute  xxxd365xxx  and monoamines

the firing rate to the same level as before ejecting  xxxd365xxx  by
increasing  xxxd3068xxx  ejection. in this paradigm, coapplication of a
partial agonist reduces the inhibitory effect of 5-ht, whereas coapplication of a full agonist does not change the inhibitory effect of 5-ht
(dong et al., 1998; ghanbari et al., 2010). to test whether the inhibitory
effect of 5-ht and  xxxd365xxx  was mediated by 5-ht1a receptors, the
inhibitory effect of iontophoretic 5-ht and  xxxd365xxx  application
was compared before and after administration of the selective 5-ht1a
receptor antagonist way 100.635 (100 mg/kg i.v.).
electrical stimulation of afferent 5-ht projections to
hippocampus. a bipolar electrode (ne-110; david kopf, tujanga,
ca) was inserted at the following coordinates (in millimeters from l)
—ap, 1.0; ml, 0.0; and dv, 7.8–8.2—to electrically stimulate 5-ht
afferents while recording a ca3 pyramidal neuron using a multibarrel pipette (see above). a stimulator (s8800; grass technologies,
warwick, ri) was used to deliver 200 square pulses (0.5 millisecond,
1 or 5 hz) at 300 ma. duration of inhibition per stimulation was
plotted in a peristimulus time histogram with a 2-millisecond bin size.
the inhibitory effect of 5-ht fiber bundle stimulation on ca3 neurons
was expressed as duration of suppression of firing (dos; in milliseconds), defined as the period from the first bin showing a 50%
reduction in the number of events per bin from the prestimulus value
and the first subsequent bin attaining a 90% recovery of the number
of events per bin from prestimulus values (chaput et al., 1986). electrical stimulation of 5-ht afferents causes endogenous release of
5-ht and briefly suppresses firing of ca3 pyramidal neurons by activating postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors, an effect previously shown to
be independent of 5-ht reuptake inhibition (chaput et al., 1986). to
determine the action of  xxxd365xxx  on a2-adrenoceptors on 5-ht
terminals, we determined whether  xxxd365xxx  (500 mg/kg i.v.) could
prevent and, in a subsequent experiment, reverse the decreasing
effect on dos of a high dose of the a2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine
(400 mg/kg i.v.). to validate this paradigm, a low dose of clonidine
(10 mg/kg i.v.) was administered before the high dose of clonidine. indeed,
it is well established that a low dose of clonidine primarily activates
a2-adrenergic autoreceptors on ne terminals and so decreases ne
tone on a2-adrenoceptors located on 5-ht terminals, resulting in
an increased dos. a subsequent high dose of clonidine activates
a2-adrenoceptors on 5-ht terminals, thereby producing a decrease in
dos (mongeau et al., 1994).
to determine the effect on the activity of terminal 5-ht1b autoreceptors, the effect of three doses of  xxxd365xxx  (500 mg/kg i.v.) on
the dos following low- and high-frequency (1 and 5 hz, respectively)
stimulations in the same neuron was compared. previous in vivo
and in vitro studies showed that increasing the stimulation from 1 to
5 hz results in greater activation of terminal 5-ht1b receptors and,
consequently, decreased 5-ht release. therefore, a longer dos
following 1-hz compared with 5-hz stimulation is indicative of
functional terminal 5-ht1b autoreceptors (chaput et al., 1986; blier
et al., 1989).
data analysis/statistics. electrophysiologic recordings were
made, and filtered from artifacts by wavemark analysis, using spike2
software version 6.17 (cambridge electronic design, cambridge,
uk). quantification of firing activity was performed using spike2,
with the exception of firing and burst analysis of vta da neurons, for
which burstidator (https://github.com/nno/burstidator) software was
used. in experiments in which no competitive exogenous ligand was
present, linear regression analysis was used to determine ed50 values
and to compare the slope and intercept when comparing the effect
of aripiprazole and  xxxd365xxx . in the presence of a competitive
exogenous ligand, nonlinear curve fitting was used to obtain ed50
values. experiments with ,3 observations within the same subject
were analyzed with a paired t test; experiments with $3 observations
within the same subject were analyzed with repeated-measures
analysis of variance followed by a tukey post hoc test. all data were
analyzed with graphpad prism version 5.01 (graphpad software,
inc., la jolla, ca). data are presented as mean 6 s.e.m.; p , 0.05
was considered significant.

100 mg/kg i.v.) were administered to reverse the inhibitory effect of doi.
the reversing effect of  xxxd365xxx  was quantified relative to baseline
firing activity.
recording of vta da neurons. putative da neurons were
recorded by positioning single-barrel glass micropipettes at the
following coordinates (in millimeters from l): ap, 3.2–3.6; ml,
0.6–1.0; and dv, 7.0–9.0. at these coordinates, neurons with a longduration (3–5 milliseconds) triphasic action potential with a marked
negative deflection, an inflection or “notch” on the rising phase, an
irregular spontaneous single-firing pattern (3–6 hz), and slow
bursting activity with decrementing action potential amplitude were
recorded (grace and bunney, 1983). the start of a burst was defined
as the occurrence of two spikes within 80 milliseconds; the end of a
burst was defined as an interspike interval of .160 milliseconds
(grace and bunney, 1984). firing and burst activity was quantified
relative to baseline, and values were obtained from the second half of
a 120-second period after injection of pharmacologic agents. to test the
effect of  xxxd365xxx  on d2 autoreceptors, da neurons were inhibited
by the da agonist apomorphine (40 mg/kg i.v.), which is known to
produce a sustained suppression of firing on these neurons (wang,
1981). following a 60-second inhibition period, cumulative doses of
 xxxd365xxx  (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg i.v.) were administered to reverse
the inhibitory effect of apomorphine. the reversing effect of  xxxd365xxx  on firing rate was quantified relative to baseline firing activity.
recording of dorsal lgn neurons. lgn neurons were
recorded by positioning multibarrel micropipettes at the following
coordinates (in millimeters from l): ap, 3.8–4.2; ml, 4.0–4.2; and dv,
4.5–5.5. they were characterized by flashing light in the eye of the rat,
which causes a brisk excitatory response in these neurons (curet and
de montigny, 1988). lgn neurons are known to be excited by iontophoretic application of ne via activation of a1-adrenergic receptors
(rogawski and aghajanian, 1980, 1982; menkes et al., 1981). because
adrenoceptors of the 1b subtype are densely expressed in the dorsal
lgn, whereas a1d-adrenoceptors are absent and there is minimal
presence of a1a-adrenoceptors (day et al., 1997), the lgn was chosen
to assess the effect of  xxxd365xxx  on a1b-adrenoceptors. neuronal
responsiveness to the iontophoretic application of ne before and after
administration of  xxxd365xxx  was assessed by determining the total
number of spikes produced, corrected for baseline activity. baseline
activity was defined as the average firing rate 30 seconds pre- and
postejection. for all data points, the average number of spikes excited
was obtained by averaging the neural response to at least two consecutive
ejections of ne separated by an interval of at least 100 seconds.
recording of pyramidal neurons in the ca3 region of the
hippocampus. ca3 pyramidal neurons were recorded by positioning multibarrel micropipettes at the following coordinates (in
millimeters from l): ap, 3.8–4.2; ml, 4.0–4.2; and dv, 3.5–4.5.
because most ca3 pyramidal neurons are not spontaneously active in
chloral hydrate–anesthetized rats, a small ejection current (21 to 11 na)
was applied to the  xxxd3068xxx  barrel to activate them within their
physiologic firing range (10–15 hz) (ranck 1973). the current and
duration of 5-ht and ne ejection were kept constant before and
after each intravenous injection of  xxxd365xxx . neuronal responsiveness to the iontophoretic application of ne was assessed by determining the total number of spikes suppressed from start of ejection
to recovery to 80% of baseline firing rate. activity of the net was
assessed by determining the recovery time to 50% of the maximal
inhibitory effect following a high-current ejection of ne (10–20 na) and
was expressed as rt50 (de montigny et al., 1980). neural responsiveness to 5-ht was assessed by determining the total number of spikes
inhibited during a 50-second ejection divided by the ejection current of
5-ht (2–5 na). activity of the sert was assessed by determining the
time (in seconds) from the end of a 50-second ejection of 5-ht (20 na)
that fully inhibited the neuron to 50% recovery of baseline firing and
was expressed as rt50 (piñeyro et al., 1994). partial or full agonism of
 xxxd365xxx  on 5-ht1a receptors was assessed by comparing the
inhibitory effect of ejection of 5-ht alone to the inhibitory effect of
concomitant ejection of 5-ht and  xxxd365xxx , following restoration of

effect of  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole on vta da
neurons.  xxxd365xxx  at cumulative doses of 200, 400, and
800 mg/kg did not significantly alter firing rate (f 1,39 5 3.15,
n 5 11, p 5 0.083; fig. 1c) or bursting activity (f 1,29 5 1.61,
n 5 10, p 5 0.21; fig. 1d) of vta da neurons from baseline
activity. aripiprazole, administered at these same doses, significantly decreased firing activity (f 1,22 5 11.93, n 5 6, p 5 0.0023;
fig. 1c) and bursting activity of vta da neurons (f 1,18 5 7.58,
n 5 5, p 5 0.013; fig. 1d). for an illustrative trace of the effect of
 xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole, see fig. 1, a and b, respectively.
effect of  xxxd365xxx  on d2 autoreceptors on vta
da neurons. following a 60-second inhibition period of
putative da neurons in the vta by the da receptor agonist
apomorphine (40 mg/kg i.v.),  xxxd365xxx  administration
(25–100 mg/kg) reversed the effect of apomorphine to ∼65% of
baseline firing. sigmoidal curve fitting (n 5 9) yielded an ed50
value of 61 mg/kg for  xxxd365xxx  on this effect (fig. 2b; for
an illustrative trace, see fig. 2a).
effect of  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole on 5-ht1a
autoreceptors. in the drn,  xxxd365xxx  at cumulative
doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg inhibited the firing of 5-ht

acute  xxxd365xxx  and monoamines

for an illustrative trace, see fig. 4a). when  xxxd365xxx  and
5-ht were ejected concomitantly, the neuronal inhibition of
ca3 pyramidal neurons did not differ from when 5-ht was
ejected alone (p . 0.05, n 5 12; fig. 4d). this inhibitory effect
of both agents was significantly dampened after systemic

effect of  xxxd365xxx  on terminal 5-ht1b autoreceptors. the dos produced on the same neuron by electrical
stimulation of 5-ht afferents with stimulation frequencies of

corresponding dos at these doses were 38 6 3, 48 6 5, and
49 6 4, while the dos at baseline was 27 6 2 milliseconds.
statistical analysis demonstrated that under control conditions and after cumulative doses of  xxxd365xxx , the dos
after 1-hz stimulation remained significantly greater than
the dos after 5-hz stimulation (slope: f 1,36 5 0.91, p . 0.05;

the ne reuptake inhibitor desipramine (5 mg/kg), whereas
the selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way 100.635 reversed this inhibition (n 5 3; for an illustrative trace, see
fig. 3a). similarly, an inhibitory effect of aripiprazole was
observed on 5-ht neurons (n 5 15) that was reversed by way
100.635 but not desipramine (n 5 3). for aripiprazole, the
experiment was initially conducted by administering cumulative doses of 200 mg/kg (n 5 6), based on a previous study (dahan
et al., 2009). as the inhibitory effect of these injections did not
fully inhibit 5-ht neurons up to a cumulative dose of 600 mg/kg,
aripiprazole was administered at 500 mg/kg (n 5 9) in a
subsequent experiment. data from these experiments were
pooled, as statistical analysis demonstrated that the doseresponsiveness of 5-ht neurons to aripiprazole at increments
of 200 and 500 mg/kg was not different (slope: f 1,45 5 0.04, p .
0.05; intercept: f 1,46 5 0.08, p . 0.05). statistical analysis
demonstrated a significantly lower ed50 value for  xxxd365xxx  than for aripiprazole (230 and 700 mg/kg, respectively;

effect of  xxxd365xxx  on postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors. in the hippocampus, systemic administration of

iontophoretic application of 5-ht on ca3 pyramidal neurons
(f 1,30 5 2.72, p . 0.05; data not shown).

estimated at 110 mg/kg (fig. 5b; for an illustrative trace, see
fig. 5a).
effect of  xxxd365xxx  on postsynaptic a1b-adrenoceptors in the lgn. in the lgn, acute administrations of
 xxxd365xxx  at a dose of 500 and 1000 mg/kg significantly
decreased the excitatory action of exogenous ne on lgn neurons
by 44% and 77%, respectively (f 2,5 5 20.10; p 5 0.0034, p , 0.05,
and p , 0.001 for these respective doses; fig. 6b), with an ed50
value estimated at 630 mg/kg. the excitatory effect of ne
ejection was not changed by prior administration of the
a1a-adrenoceptor antagonist snap 5089 (1 mg/kg i.v.), whereas
 xxxd365xxx  administration still decreased neuronal excitability in the lgn after snap 5089 administration (n 5 2; for an
illustration, see fig. 6a).
effect of  xxxd365xxx  on postsynaptic a2-adrenoceptors. in the hippocampus ca3 region, systemic administration of  xxxd365xxx  up to a dose of 1500 mg/kg did not
change the number of spikes inhibited per nanoampere following iontophoretic application of ne on pyramidal neurons
(f 1,28 5 0.95, p . 0.05; data not shown).

effect of  xxxd365xxx  on the net. in the hippocampus ca3 region, the rt50 value following iontophoretic application of ne on ca3 pyramidal neurons was not changed

(f 1,30 5 0.01, p . 0.05; data not shown).
effect of  xxxd365xxx  on terminal a2-adrenoceptors on 5-ht terminals. clonidine at a dose of 10 mg/kg
significantly increased the dos value following 1-hz stimulation compared with baseline, an effect completely reversed
by a subsequent injection of clonidine at a dose of 400 mg/kg
(f 3,5 5 13.63, n 5 6, p , 0.0001; fig. 7a). following these
doses of clonidine, the dos increased with cumulative administration of  xxxd365xxx  (500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg i.v.)
in a dose-dependent fashion (tukey post hoc test, p , 0.01,
p , 0.001, and p , 0.001 for these doses, respectively).
administration of  xxxd365xxx  alone also increased the
dos value in a dose-dependent manner (f 3,4 5 4.16, n 5 5,

significant effect of  xxxd365xxx  on dos at a dose of 1000

discussion
 xxxd365xxx : effect on vta da neurons.  xxxd365xxx  reversed the inhibitory action of the da receptor
agonist apomorphine on neural firing of vta da neurons,
thus demonstrating antagonistic action at d2 autoreceptors
(fig. 2). interestingly,  xxxd365xxx  by itself did not significantly change the firing rate or bursting activity of da
neurons (fig. 1). in contrast, the classic  xxxg656xxx  antagonist haloperidol is known to increase firing and burst
activity of vta da neurons when administered acutely, an
effect attributable to blockade of endogenous da inhibitory
tone on d2 autoreceptors (pucak and grace, 1994). because
 xxxd365xxx  did not alter firing and bursting activity of vta
da neurons, this result demonstrates that, in vivo, it acts
neither as a pure antagonist nor as an agonist with high
intrinsic activity on d2 autoreceptors. aripiprazole, similarly
to  xxxd365xxx , was previously shown to reverse neuronal
inhibition of vta da neurons by apomorphine, although
less potently (dahan et al., 2009). in the present study,

aripiprazole significantly reduced the firing and bursting
activity of vta da neurons to a similar degree as reported
previously (fig. 1; dahan et al., 2009). the difference in
effects on da neurons of aripiprazole and  xxxd365xxx  is
likely due to a lower intrinsic activity of the latter agent at d2
receptors, in line with their in vitro profiles (maeda et al.,
2014b). notably, the present study also demonstrated more
potent in vivo agonism of  xxxd365xxx  on 5-ht1a receptors
than aripiprazole (discussed below). because activation of prefrontal 5-ht1a receptors is known to excite vta da neurons
(arborelius et al., 1993; díaz-mataix et al., 2005; gronier, 2008),
a difference in degree of  xxxg1108xxx  agonism could
contribute to the distinct effects of  xxxd365xxx  and aripiprazole on the firing activity of da neurons.
 xxxd365xxx : effect on the 5-ht system.  xxxd365xxx  dose-dependently decreased the firing rate of 5-ht
neurons in the drn (fig. 3). this inhibitory effect was due to
agonism at 5-ht1a receptors on these neurons, as the selective
 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way 100.635, but not the ne
reuptake inhibitor desipramine, reversed the inhibitory action
of  xxxd365xxx  (fig. 3a). compared with aripiprazole,
 xxxd365xxx  was significantly more potent at activating
5-ht1a autoreceptors (fig. 3b), a finding in line with the in

vitro affinity for 5-ht 1a receptors of these agents (maeda
et al., 2014b). to the best of our knowledge, two previous
studies assessed the dose-dependent effect of aripiprazole
to inhibit drn 5-ht neurons; dahan et al. (2009) reported
an ed50 value of 540 mg/kg, in close similarity to the present findings, while the ed 50 for aripiprazole in the work
by stark et al. (2007) is estimated at 200–250 mg/kg. the
reason for this difference remains to be established, although
linear versus logarithmic dose-response estimation could play
a role.
in the hippocampus, the activity of the sert, assessed using
the rt50 index, remained unaltered following  xxxd365xxx 
administration up to a dose of 1500 mg/kg, whereas drugs that
occupy sert to a significant extent in vivo are known to
prolong the rt50 index (piñeyro et al., 1994; ghanbari et al.,
2010). microiontophoretic application of  xxxd365xxx  and
5-ht both inhibited ca3 pyramidal neurons (fig. 4, a and

c), an effect attributable to 5-ht1a activation. indeed, the
inhibitory effect of these agents was blocked after systemic
administration of way 100.635 (fig. 4, b and c). importantly,
the inhibitory effect of 5-ht alone was unaltered when
 xxxd365xxx  was coejected (fig. 4d). this absence of competitive action on 5-ht1a receptors of  xxxd365xxx  with 5-ht
indicates that  xxxd365xxx  acted as a full  xxxg1108xxx 
agonist in vivo. indeed, previous studies using the same paradigm showed full agonistic action of bay 3702 (dong et al., 1998)
and trazodone (ghanbari et al., 2010), whereas 8-ohdpat
(2-dipropylamino-8-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene;
hadrava et al., 1996), gepirone (hadrava et al., 1995), and
asenapine (ghanbari et al., 2009) acted as partial agonists at
5-ht1a receptors in the hippocampus.

the dos following electrical stimulations of 5-ht afferents at
1 hz (fig. 7b), an effect that could theoretically be attributable

to terminal 5-ht1b autoreceptors and/or a2-adrenergic heteroceptor antagonism (chaput et al., 1986; mongeau et al., 1993).
however,  xxxd365xxx  administration did not change the difference in dos following 1- and 5-hz stimulations, indicating
that terminal 5-ht1b autoreceptor functionality was unaffected by  xxxd365xxx . in contrast,  xxxd365xxx  acted as a
potent a2-adrenergic heteroceptor antagonist, as shown in two
complementary experiments where  xxxd365xxx  reversed
(fig. 7a) and prevented (fig. 7b) the typical decrease in
dos caused by a high dose of the a2-adrenoceptor agonist
clonidine (400 mg/kg i.v.). such effects have previously been
observed following acute administration of the antidepressants  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine (mongeau et al., 1993;
haddjeri et al., 1996).
 xxxd365xxx : effect on the ne system. in the lc,
ne neurons are innervated by inhibitory gaba neurons that
express excitatory 5-ht2a receptors; activation of 5-ht2a

receptors enhances gaba neurotransmission and inhibits ne
neurons (szabo and blier, 2001). indeed, systemic administration of the preferential  xxxg1113xxx  agonist doi strongly
inhibited ne neurons. because this effect was potently reversed by  xxxd365xxx , antagonistic action of this agent on
5-ht2a receptors was clearly demonstrated (fig. 5). in the
present study, the ed50 value of  xxxd365xxx  for 5-ht2a
receptor antagonism was ∼2-fold higher than for  xxxg656xxx  antagonism (110 versus 61 mg/kg, respectively), which is
qualitatively in line with its in vitro profile (maeda et al.,
2014b). notably, caution should be taken when comparing in
vitro and in vivo data for agents in their effectiveness in
reversing the action of receptor agonists, as ed50 values are
relative to the affinity, intrinsic activity, and dose of the
agonist. additionally, the multiple receptor activity of  xxxd365xxx  could affect more than one neuronal substrate in vivo.
to illustrate this point, the in vitro affinity of asenapine is
1 order of magnitude greater for 5-ht2a than for d2 receptors
(shahid et al., 2009), whereas the in vivo ed50 value for
d2 receptors was found to be ∼2-fold higher than for 5-ht2a
receptors (ghanbari et al., 2009).
in the hippocampus ca3 region,  xxxd365xxx  did not
modify the inhibitory response to iontophoretic application
of ne or the rt50 index, indicating no action on postsynaptic
a2-adrenoceptors and the net, respectively (de montigny
et al., 1980; curet and de montigny, 1988). in the lgn, neurons are known to almost exclusively express a1-adrenergic
receptors of the 1b subtype (day et al., 1997). in this brain
region, the antagonistic effect of  xxxd365xxx  on these receptors was assessed by quantifying neuronal excitation following iontophoretically applied ne, a response known to be
mediated by a1-adrenoceptors (rogawski and aghajanian,
1980, 1982; menkes et al., 1981). neuronal excitation decreased
with  xxxd365xxx  administration, strongly suggesting antagonistic action at a1-adrenergic receptors (fig. 6b). because
there is no expression of a1d-adrenoreceptors yet minimal
expression of a1a -adrenoceptors (day et al., 1997), the excitatory effect of ne after administration of the selective
a1a -adrenoreceptor antagonist snap 5089 was assessed
(wetzel et al., 1995). the excitatory effect of iontophoretic application of ne on lgn neurons was not altered by snap 5089
administration, whereas consecutive administrations of  xxxd365xxx  largely blocked this excitatory effect (fig. 6a).
taken together, these results suggest antagonistic properties
of  xxxd365xxx  predominantly at a1b-adrenoceptors, consistent with its 20-fold-higher affinity for this receptor subtype
over a1a- and a1d-adrenoceptors (maeda et al., 2014b).
conclusion. the present results show acute in vivo action
of  xxxd365xxx  at all three monoamine (5-ht, ne, and da)
systems. similarly to aripiprazole,  xxxd365xxx  acted as a
partial  xxxg656xxx  agonist in vivo but is relatively less
efficacious at this receptor subtype. clinically,  xxxg656xxx 
partial agonism is thought to buffer fluctuations in da transmission (burris et al., 2002; shapiro et al., 2003), in line with
the behavioral effects of  xxxd365xxx  in animal models of
schizophrenia (maeda et al., 2014a). furthermore, the potent
in vivo agonistic action of  xxxd365xxx  on 5-ht1a receptors
could be a relevant pharmacologic feature in treatment of
both mood disorders and schizophrenia (blier and ward,
2003; newman-tancredi, 2010). acute  xxxd365xxx  administration reduced inhibition of two important interaction
nodes between the 5-ht and ne systems. first, it blocked

5-ht2a receptors, a receptor type that dampens lc ne firing
when 5-ht neurotransmission is enhanced (dremencov
et al., 2007; chernoloz et al., 2009). second,  xxxd365xxx 
blocked a2-adrenoceptors on 5-ht terminals, a receptor type
that dampens 5-ht release when ne neurotransmission is elevated (mongeau et al., 1993). as the therapeutic effect of potent
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonism in combination with 5-ht reuptake
inhibitors is well recognized (nelson and papakostas, 2009), the
present data support the use of  xxxd365xxx  as an augmentation strategy. this notion is strengthened by the recent demonstration of clinical efficaciousness of  xxxd365xxx  as an
adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder (thase
et al., 2014). in addition, combined but not separate administration of  xxxd365xxx  and ne or 5-ht reuptake inhibitors had
an antidepressant-like effect in rodents (hirose et al., 2014).
following this in vivo pharmacologic characterization, and
because  xxxd365xxx  will be administered on a long-term
basis in the clinic, it will be crucial to investigate the effect of
sustained  xxxd365xxx  administration on therapeutically
relevant monoamine targets.
