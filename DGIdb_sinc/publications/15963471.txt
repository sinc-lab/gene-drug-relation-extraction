abstract
thiazolidinediones are a new class of anti-diabetic agents which increase insulin sensitivity by binding to the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor g ( xxxg1807xxx ) and stimulating the expression of insulin-responsive genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. these
drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. however the mechanisms for these actions are
not fully understood. adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ent). the present study studied
the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on  xxxg2131xxx  in the human aortic smooth muscle cells
(hasmcs). although incubating hasmcs for 48 h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on  xxxg2131xxx  mrna and protein levels,
troglitazone acutely inhibited [3h]adenosine uptake and [3h]nbmpr binding of hasmcs with ic50 values of 2.35  0.35 and
3.99  0.57 mm, respectively. the effect of troglitazone on  xxxg2131xxx  was  xxxg1807xxx -independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone
was a competitive inhibitor of  xxxg2131xxx . in contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3h]adenosine uptake by hasmcs.
troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a  xxxd3521xxx  moiety. the difference in structure of
troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on  xxxg2131xxx  because  xxxd3521xxx  did not inhibit [3h]adenosine uptake by hasmcs. using
the nucleoside transporter deficient pk15ntd cells stably expressing  xxxg2131xxx  and  xxxg2132xxx , it was found that troglitazone inhibited  xxxg2131xxx  but
had no effect on  xxxg2132xxx . from these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting
 xxxg2131xxx . pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of  xxxg2131xxx .

1. introduction
thiazolidinediones are a group of structurally related
compounds with a common thiazolidine- xxxd309xxx  ring
attached to different side-chains. these compounds are
used for the treatment of type 2 diabetics. thiazolidinediones increase insulin sensitivity in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma ( xxxg1807xxx )-dependent
manner by promoting the expression of insulin responsive
genes in order to reduce blood glucose levels and correct
hyperinsulinemia [1–4]. conversely,  xxxg1807xxx -independent

actions of thiazolidinediones have also been reported,
including direct dilatory and anti-proliferative effects on
vascular smooth muscle cells (smcs) [5–10] as well as
rapid inhibition of l-type calcium channels [7,9,10].
adenosine is the most important physiological nucleoside. it acts through g-protein coupled receptors to exert
diverse effects on cellular functions [11]. it is released in
response to cell injury and stress to modulate cell and organ
energy demand and consumption. for instance, hypoxia
and ischemia lead to an increase in extracellular adenosine
which causes vasodilation by acting through a2 adenosine
receptors on vascular smcs [12] and thus increases blood
flow and oxygenation. interestingly, adenosine has also
been shown to inhibit growth of aortic smcs [13]. since
adenosine is a substrate of nucleoside transporters, nucleoside transporters play integral roles in adenosine functions
by regulating adenosine levels in the vicinity of adenosine

receptors [14]. recently, it was shown that diabetes
changes  xxxg2131xxx  message and/or protein expression.
 xxxg2131xxx  message expression in heart, liver and kidney of
 xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats are decreased [15].
interestingly, diabetes induces opposite changes in
 xxxg2131xxx  activity and message in vascular endothelial cells
and smcs [16,17]. we previously showed that hasmcs
contain  xxxg2131xxx  as their sole functional nucleoside transporter and glucose up-regulates  xxxg2131xxx  activity, protein and
message levels [18]. these results suggested that the
increase in  xxxg2131xxx  activity in diabetes may affect the
availability of adenosine in the vicinity of adenosine
receptors and thus alter vascular functions in diabetes.
since thiazolidinediones activate  xxxg1807xxx  to regulate
expression of genes at transcriptional levels, in the present
study, we determined whether thiazolidinediones would
prevent the glucose-induced stimulation of  xxxg2131xxx  activity,
protein and message levels in hasmcs. this might provide a possible mechanism for alternation of vascular
functions in diabetes by thiazolidinediones as the availability of adenosine to its receptors might be changed.

2. materials and methods
2.1. culture of hasmcs
hasmcs were obtained from american tissue culture
collection (manassas, va) and cultured in dmem (containing 5 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 8c in 95% air–5% co2. forty-eight hours
prior to uptake study and mrna and protein isolation, cells
were incubated in serum-free dmem and were grown in
the presence of either 5 mm (control) or 25 mm glucose
and with and without thiazolidinediones as described in
each figure legend.
2.2. adenosine uptake
all experiments were carried out in na+-free buffer
containing (in mm): 140 n-methyl-d-glucamine (nmdg),
5 hepes, 5 kh2po4, 1 cacl2, 1 mgcl2 and 10 d-glucose
(ph 7.4), because the nucleoside transport in hasmcs is
sodium-independent. confluent monolayers of cells in 24well plates were washed three times in na+-free buffered
solution. three hundred microlitres of na+-free buffered
solution containing [3h]adenosine (10 mm, 10 mm
nbmpr, 2 mci/ml) was then added to each well for
1 min. to study the effects of thiazolidinedione, drugs
(30 mm) were added to the cells simultaneously with
[3h]adenosine. the plates were then washed three times
rapidly with ice-cold pbs containing (in mm): 137 nacl,
2.68 kcl, 1.47 kh2po4 and 8.1 na2hpo4 (ph 7.4). cells
were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 5% (v/v) triton x-100. the
radioactivity was measured by a b-scintillation counter.

the protein content was determined spectrophotometrically using a commercial bicinchoninic acid assay (pierce
biochemicals, rockford, il).
2.3. rna isolation and rt-pcr
total rna was isolated from hasmcs using trizol
reagent (invitrogen, grand island, ny). two micrograms
of total rna were used for first strand cdna synthesis
using random hexamer primers and superscript ii rnase
h reverse transcriptase (superscript preamplification
system, invitrogen). the resulting first strand cdna was
directly used for pcr amplification.
the two primers for amplifying  xxxg2131xxx  (accession number
nm_004955) were sense 50 -gacatgtcccagaatgtgtcc-30 (corresponding to nucleotides 308-328) and
antisense 50 -gggtccttcaagcttgagctg-30 (corresponding to nucleotides 887-907), which generated a
600-base pair (bp) pcr product. to semi-quantify the
pcr products of  xxxg2131xxx , optical density values of nucleoside
transporter bands were normalized to those of b-actin. the
two primers for amplifying b-actin (accession number
nm_001101) were sense 50 -ggcgtgatggtgggcatg-30 (corresponding to nucleotides 197-214) and antisense 50 -ctgggtcatcttctcgcg-30 (corresponding to
nucleotides 419-436), which yielded a pcr product of 240bp. reactions were carried out for 30 cycles with the
following parameters: denaturation at 94 8c for 30 s, annealing at 55 8c for 1 min and extension at 72 8c for 1.5 min.
pcr products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis
and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide.
2.4. western blotting
polyclonal anti- xxxg2131xxx  antibody was raised in rabbit as
previously described [19]. hasmcs were grown to confluence on 10-cm petri dishes. all subsequent manipulations of the cells were conducted at 4 8c with ice-cold
solutions. the cells were washed three times with pbs,
scraped in 2 ml of 5 mm sodium phosphate, ph 8, with a
protease inhibitor cocktail (sigma, st. louis, mo) (1:100,
v/v). cells were sonicated briefly and centrifuged at
3000  g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells.
the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000  g
for 30 min to pellet the crude microsomal membranes,
which was resuspended in 5 mm sodium phosphate. the
crude membranes were then resolved on 9% (w/v) sdspolyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. after blocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat
dry milk in pbs overnight at 4 8c, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the anti-hent1 antibody
(1:100, v/v, dilution in blocking solution) at room temperature for 2 h. nitrocellulose membranes were then
washed extensively with 0.02% (v/v) triton x-100 in
pbs. after washing, the membranes were incubated with
horseradish-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary anti-

body (1:5000, v/v, dilution in blocking solution) at room
temperature for 2 h. excess secondary antibody was again
washed, and the bound secondary antibody was detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence (western blot chemiluminescence reagent plus; nen life science products, boston,
ma). protein expression of b-actin was similarly detected
with the monoclonal mouse anti-actin antibody (chemicon,
temecular, ca). the molecular size of  xxxg2131xxx  and b-actin are
40 and 43 kda, respectively. optical density values of the
 xxxg2131xxx  bands were normalized to those of b-actin.
2.5. high affinity [3h]nbmpr binding
crude membranes were prepared as described for western blotting. [3h]nbmpr binding assays were performed
at room temperature with 5 mm sodium phosphate (ph 8).
incubations were initiated by adding an aliquot of microsomal membranes of hasmcs (300 mg) to 0.5 nm
[3h]nbmpr and were terminated after 30 min by rapid
filtration with whatman gf/b filters, which were then
washed twice with 5 ml ice-cold 5 mm sodium phosphate
(ph 8). to determine the ic50 of thiazolidinediones on
inhibition of [3h]nbmpr binding, various concentrations
of drugs (0–30 mm) were included with 0.5 nm [3h]nbmpr
during the 30 min incubation with microsomal membranes.
the bound and the free [3h]nbmpr were then separated
similarly by rapid filtration. the radioactivity retained on
the filters was counted by a b-scintillation counter after
dissolving in liquiscint (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj). nonspecific binding of [3h]nbmpr was determined in the presence of 10 mm nbmpr.
2.6. materials
all chemicals were purchased from sigma–aldrich (st.
louis, mo). [3h]adenosine and [3h]uridine was from
amersham biosciences (piscataway, nj). [3h]nbmpr
was from moravek biochemicals (brea, ca). cell culture
media and supplements were from invitrogen (grand
island, ny).
2.7. statistical analysis
adenosine uptake data were expressed as means  s.e.m. of three experiments performed in triplicate.
student’s t-test and analysis of variance were used for
paired and multiple variants, respectively. p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

3. results
3.1. effects of thiazolidinediones on  xxxg2131xxx  in hasmcs
it has been previously shown that [3h]adenosine transport in hasmcs was mediated by the nbmpr-sensitive

357

 xxxg2131xxx  and glucose treatment up-regulated  xxxg2131xxx  activity
with a parallel increase in  xxxg2131xxx  protein and message. as
thiazolidinediones bind to the nuclear receptor,  xxxg1807xxx  to
regulate the transcription of a multitude of genes [20–23],
we determined whether chronic exposure of hasmc to
thiazolidinediones would affect  xxxg2131xxx  expression in
hasmcs. as shown in fig. 1a, all thiazolidinediones
tested had no significant effect on nbmpr-sensitive
[3h]adenosine uptake ( xxxg2131xxx  activity) of hasmcs. also,
there was also no change in the mrna and protein levels of
 xxxg2131xxx  under these conditions (fig. 1b and c). glucose
(25 mm) up-regulated  xxxg2131xxx  activity, mrna and protein
levels of hasmcs (fig. 2a). however, thiazolidinediones
had no effect on glucose stimulation of  xxxg2131xxx  activity,
mrna (fig. 2b) and protein (fig. 2c). furthermore, the
 xxxg1807xxx  antagonist,  xxxd1216xxx  (100 mm) also had no effect
on glucose up-regulation of  xxxg2131xxx  (data not shown).
adenosine is a vasodilator and thiazolidinediones have
been shown to lower blood pressure in vivo [2,24,25].
therefore, we tested whether the thiazolidinediones could
directly affect  xxxg2131xxx  activity. it was found that troglitazone
caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of [3h]adenosine uptake of  xxxg2131xxx  in hasmcs with an ic50 of
2.35  0.35 mm (fig. 3). in contrast, pioglitazone and
ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3h]adenosine uptake
in hasmcs (fig. 3). pioglitazone and ciglitazone at
30 mm inhibited [3h]adenosine uptake of  xxxg2131xxx  by 13
and 8%, respectively. similar results were obtained when
the drugs were pre-incubated with cells for 30 min before
the assay of [3h]adenosine uptake. equilibrative nucleoside transporters are broadly selective. as shown in fig. 4,
troglitazone, but not pioglitazone and ciglitazone also
inhibited the [3h]uridine uptake by hasmcs with a
similar ic50 of 4.38  0.34 mm. high affinity
[3h]nbmpr binding has been used for assessing the
number of  xxxg2131xxx  molecules and the affinity of nbmpr
to  xxxg2131xxx . it was found that troglitazone inhibited
[3h]nbmpr binding in a dose-dependent manner with
an ic50 of 3.99  0.57 mm (fig. 5). the structural difference between troglitazone and other thiazolidinediones is
that the former contains the  xxxd3521xxx  moiety. however,
 xxxd3521xxx  did not affect the [3h]adenosine uptake and
[3h]nbmpr binding of hasmcs (fig. 6).
3.2. kinetics of troglitazone inhibition of adenosine
transport
the kinetic mechanism by which troglitazone inhibited
adenosine transport was studied. as shown in fig. 7a,
troglitazone decreased the apparent km of [3h]adenosine
uptake without change on vmax. the apparent km values
(mm) were 26.9  0.89, 33.19  4.11, 52.25  11.14, and
364.99  140.18, and the vmax values (pmol(mg protein min)) were 30.27  0.32, 29.19  1.10, 30.31  1.98, and
30.14  4.13 in the presence of 0, 0.1, 1, 10 mm troglitazone, respectively. 1/[s] versus 1/v plots of each concentra-

tion-dependence curve showed that the slopes of the linear
plots increased with increasing concentration of troglitazone
(fig. 7b). these slopes of the linear plots were then plotted
against troglitazone concentrations (fig. 7b, insert), revealing the ki value of 2.23  0.29 mm (n = 3).
3.3. effects of troglitazone on recombinant  xxxg2131xxx  and
 xxxg2132xxx 
to test whether troglitazone is a general inhibitor of
ent isoforms, we studied the effects of troglitazone on
recombinant hent1 and hent2, which have been transfected into the nucleoside transporter-deficient cell line,
pk15ntd [26]. consistent with the results from
hasmcs, troglitazone inhibited recombinant  xxxg2131xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner with an ic50 of 5.17  0.92 mm
(fig. 8). recombinant  xxxg2132xxx , however, was relatively
resistant to troglitazone. 30 mm of troglitazone, which
completely inhibited recombinant  xxxg2131xxx , only inhibited
recombinant  xxxg2132xxx  by 12%.

4. discussion
nucleoside transporters play crucial roles in adenosine
homeostasis and are important in modulating the effects of

adenosine on vascular smcs. recent studies have shown
that inhibition of  xxxg2131xxx  increases extracellular adenosine
concentrations and this causes vasodilation and inhibits
vascular smc proliferation [27–29]. in diabetics, changes
in expression of  xxxg2131xxx  are tissue specific.  xxxg2131xxx  expression
in heart, liver and kidney of  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats are decreased [15]. however,  xxxg2131xxx  message is
increased in freshly isolated human umbilical artery smcs
[16] but is decreased in the umbilical vein endothelial cells
from gestational diabetic pregnancies [30], when the
effects are compared to the corresponding cells isolated
from normal pregnancies. high glucose at 25 mm which
mimics glucose levels in diabetics also decreases adenosine transport of  xxxg2131xxx  in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [17] but increases adenosine transport of  xxxg2131xxx  in
hasmcs [18]. however, whether insulin could reverse the
effect of diabetics on  xxxg2131xxx  expression in tissues and/or
cells is controversial. administration of insulin to  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats was unable to restore the
decreased  xxxg2131xxx  expression in heart, liver and kidney [15].
in contrast, aguayo and co-workers demonstrated that
insulin inhibited the elevated  xxxg2131xxx  expression in human
umbilical artery smcs from diabetic pregnancy via activation of adenylyl cyclase [16]. this discrepancy may be due
to differences in species (rat versus human) and/or models
(animal versus primary cultured cells). to our knowledge,

the effects of antidiabetic agents other than insulin, on
 xxxg2131xxx  have not been reported. although chronic incubation of thiazolidinediones did not change  xxxg2131xxx  expression
in hasmcs, the present study showed that a thiazolidinedinone, troglitazone is a novel competitive inhibitor of
 xxxg2131xxx .
thiazolidinediones are agonists for  xxxg1807xxx , which is a
nuclear receptor predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, where it promotes adipocyte differentiation and regulates expression of genes involved in glucose and fatty
acid metabolism [31]. recently, the existence of  xxxg1807xxx 
has been reported in vascular smcs [32,33].  xxxg1807xxx 
activation has been shown to inhibit vascular smc proliferation and migration [5,8,20], suggesting that  xxxg1807xxx 
may play a role in limiting the arterial remodeling that

occurs in response to hypertension, atherosclerosis or
restenosis. it has been shown that  xxxg1807xxx  activation in
vascular smcs inhibits the expression of matrix metalloproteinases [20], thromboxane receptor [21], plateletderived growth factors-a receptor [22] and angiotensin
ii type i receptor [23]. we have previously shown that
chronic incubation of hasmcs with high glucose
increases the amount of  xxxg2131xxx  message and thus  xxxg2131xxx 
is regulated at the transcriptional level [18]. given that
 xxxg1807xxx  regulates various genes at the transcription level,
we examined whether thiazolidinediones affected  xxxg2131xxx 
expression in hasmcs. exposure of thiazolidinediones to
hasmcs, either in the presence or the absence of 25 mm
glucose, for 48 h did not affect the  xxxg2131xxx  abundance in
hasmcs (figs. 1 and 2). therefore, our data suggested
that  xxxg1807xxx  was involved neither in the regulation of the
basal expression of the  xxxg2131xxx  nor the glucose up-regulated
 xxxg2131xxx  expression.
although all thiazolidinedione analogs have similar
functions as insulin sensitizers whose effects are
 xxxg1807xxx -dependent, each analog might have unique
 xxxg1807xxx -independent effects on the vasculature and such
effects do not modify gene transcription. for example,
troglitazone and rosiglitazone inhibit voltage-dependent
k+ channels and nonselective cation channels in vascular
smcs, but they have opposite effects on ca2+-activated k+
channels [6,7,34]. troglitazone differs from other thiazolidinediones in that it has a  xxxd3521xxx  moiety as its sidechain and thus possesses radical scavenging ability similar
to  xxxd3521xxx  [35,36]. this property of troglitazone is
accounted for the improvement of the reduced skin blood
flow in diabetic rats [37]. however, not all effects of
troglitazone are attributed to the radical scavenger actions
of  xxxd3521xxx . troglitazone, but not  xxxd3521xxx , inhibits the
dna synthesis in vascular smcs [38]. similarly, our
results showed that  xxxd3521xxx  did not affect  xxxg2131xxx  activity
(fig. 6) and thus, the competitive inhibition of troglitazone
on  xxxg2131xxx  was  xxxd3521xxx -independent. the ki of inhibition
of troglitazone on  xxxg2131xxx  was 2.23  0.29 mm (fig. 7).
this ki value correlates well with potential pharmacological concentrations of troglitazone in vivo. it has been
reported that 2.5–3.5 h after 200 mg troglitazone, a dose
that improves glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity, the
plasma concentration of troglitazone in human is 11.3–
15.9 mm [39]. therefore, troglitazone is a potential in vivo
inhibitor of  xxxg2131xxx  at pharmacological concentrations.
recently, it was shown that a wide variety of protein
kinase inhibitors are also inhibitors of  xxxg2131xxx  and their
actions on  xxxg2131xxx  are kinase-independent [40,41]. however, whether these protein kinase inhibitors affect  xxxg2132xxx 
has not yet been clarified. we have generated a nucleoside
transporter-deficient cell line, pk15ntd, and have stably
expressed  xxxg2131xxx  and  xxxg2132xxx  in this cell model [26]. therefore, we examined the sensitivities of  xxxg2131xxx  and  xxxg2132xxx  to
troglitazone in pk15ntd/ xxxg2131xxx  and pk15ntd/ xxxg2132xxx 
cells. our results showed that troglitazone is a competitive

inhibitor of  xxxg2131xxx  (fig. 7). in contrast,  xxxg2132xxx  is resistant to
troglitazone up to 10 mm (fig. 8).
in conclusion, thiazolidinediones have no effect on the
basal expression of  xxxg2131xxx  and on the glucose up-regulated
 xxxg2131xxx  expression in hasmcs. however, a thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, is a competitive inhibitor of  xxxg2131xxx .
the inhibition of  xxxg2131xxx  activity by troglitazone may
influence the availability of adenosine in the vicinity of
adenosine receptors and subsequently affect vascular function.
