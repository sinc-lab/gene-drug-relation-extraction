recent data have revealed that disruption of  xxxd3105xxx  signaling
observed in alzheimer’s disease (ad) leads to a deposition of b-amyloid
(ab). the aim of this study was to precise the role of  xxxd3105xxx  and its
nuclear receptors (rar) in the processes leading to the ab deposits.
thus, the effect of  xxxd3105xxx  depletion and subsequent administration
of  xxxd3417xxx  (ra, the active metabolite of  xxxd3105xxx ) on the
expression of  xxxg1932xxx , and of proteins involved in amyloidogenic
pathway, e.g.,  xxxg178xxx  (app), b-secretase enzyme
(bace), and app carboxy-terminal fragment (app-ctf) was examined in the whole brain, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex of
rats. rats fed a  xxxd3105xxx -deprived diet for 13 weeks exhibited
decreased amount of  xxxg1932xxx , app695, bace, and of app-ctf in the
whole brain and in the cerebral cortex. administration of ra is able to
restore all expression. the results suggest that fine regulation of
 xxxd3105xxx  mediated gene expression seems fundamental for the
regulation of app processing.

ra isomers) and rxr (whose ligand is the  xxxd114xxx  isomer)
(marill et al., 2003). it is well-known that retinoids, and
particularly  xxxd3417xxx , play a critical role in a variety of
essential life processes, including reproduction, embryonic development, and modulation of the growth and differentiation of a wide
variety of mammalian cell types (bonet et al., 2003).
presently, the role of retinoids in the adult central nervous
system is less conspicuous than their role in development and has
only recently attracted scientific attention. some data suggest that
fine regulation of retinoid mediated gene expression seems
fundamentally important for optimal brain functioning such as
ltp, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (enderlin et al.,
1997; chiang et al., 1998; etchamendy et al., 2001, 2003; misner
et al., 2001; cocco et al., 2002). similarly, changes at the retinoid
level appear capable of producing alterations in neuronal target
proteins and consequently may affect physiological maintenance
processes in the mature brain (malik et al., 2000; lane and bailey,
2005). among the many genes whose expression is regulated by
ra, there are those coding for their own nuclear (yamagata et al.,
1993) receptors and those coding for neuron-specific proteins
involved in many activities in the mature brain, e.g., nerve growth
factor (fiorentini et al., 2002), n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
(beczkowska et al., 1996), dopamin receptor 2 (farooqui, 1994),
 xxxg440xxx  (kobayashi et al., 1994), neurogranin
(iñiguez et al., 1994).
recently, data from a number of studies have argued for the
involvement of retinoid signaling in the etiology of alzheimer’s
disease (ad) (goodman and pardee, 2003; corcoran et al., 2004).
this disease is characterized by the presence of two major
pathologic lesions, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles.
neuritic plaques are composed of extracellular fibrillar deposits of
h-amyloid peptide. the involvement of app, an integral membrane
glycoprotein, in the mechanisms of these deposits is well
documented (neve et al., 1990; sinha, 2002). the app gene
undergoes alternative splicing to yield three major mrna transcripts, app770, app751, and app695 with two minor transcripts,

fig. 1. schematic representation of the app amyloidogenic pathway. the h-secretase (bace) cleaves app695 leading to the secreted form of app (appsh)
and to the carboxy-terminal fragments (app-hctf and app-hvctf). the latter are cleaved by the g-secretase complex, which generates a carboxy-terminal
fragment (gctf) and the peptide ah.

app563, and app714 (tanzi et al., 1988). the app770 and
app751 isoforms are protected by the presence of the kunitz
protease inhibitor (kpi) domain, whereas the app695 isoform,
lacking this kpi domain, undergoes amyloidogenic pathwayrelated sequential proteolytic processing by h- and g-secretases,
generating the h-amyloid peptide (ah peptide) (leblanc et al.,
1996; simons et al., 1996; gao and pimplikar, 2001) (fig. 1). the
more amyloidogenic fragment ah1 – 42 aggregates and forms the
nidus of plaque leading to cell death (dugué et al., 2003). the
recently identified enzyme bace is the major h-secretase
responsible for generation of ah peptides by neurons (cai et al.,
2001; bodendorf et al., 2002). this enzyme leads to the cleavage
of the app ectodomain at the n-terminus region, producing
membrane-bound c-terminal fragments (app-hctf and apphvctf), the direct precursors of ah (evin et al., 2003). app-ctf
is considered to be a potential early marker for the biological
diagnosis of ad (sergeant et al., 2002). interestingly, several
studies have shown that expression of some of ad-related genes
are under control of ra in the brain, e.g., h-site app-cleaving
enzyme (bace) (satoh and kuroda, 2000), amyloid precursor
protein (app) (hung et al., 1992; yang et al., 1998; murray and
ihwe, 2003), or a-synuclein, a non-ah component of amyloid
plaques (satoh and kuroda, 2001). moreover, recent studies have
revealed a decrease in serum retinol in ad patients (bourdelmarchasson et al., 2001; rinaldi et al., 2003). some authors have
reported that (i) hypo-functioning of retinoid signaling pathway is
a key factor in development of ad (goodman and pardee, 2003),

and (ii) disruption of retinoid signaling causes deposition of hamyloid in the adult brain (corcoran et al., 2004). finally, vitamin
a or retinoid seems to impair and destabilize preformed ah
aggregates and consequently seems to protect against plaque
formation, probably via its nuclear receptors (ono et al., 2004;
sahin et al., 2005). such effects of  xxxd3105xxx  are of primary
importance in that attenuating ah mediated neuro-degeneration is,
today, of major consideration in a potential treatment for ad.
thus, in the present study, the role of  xxxd3105xxx , and its
receptors, in the processes leading to amyloid deposits was studied
in vivo. therefore, using a model of postnatal  xxxd3105xxx 
deprivation, the effect of a  xxxd3105xxx -free diet, with or without
administration of ra, on the amount of mrna of ra nuclear
receptor (rarh) and on three target genes involved in amyloid
deposits (app695 and app770-751 and the h-secretase bace) in
the whole brain and in hippocampus, striatum, and cortex of adult
rat was evaluated. we have choice to favor, in this study, the
quantification of rarh mrna since this isoform (i) is the major
receptor in the adult brain (maret et al., 2005), (ii) seems upregulated by its own ligand in several organs including brain (kato
et al., 1992; yamagata et al., 1993; alfos et al., 2001), and (iii) is
implicated in optimal adult brain functioning (chiang et al., 1998;
enderlin et al., 1997; etchamendy et al., 2001, 2003; husson et al.
2004).
the levels of mrna were measured using a real-time
polymerase chain reaction (pcr). moreover, using a western blot
analysis, the amount of app carboxy-terminal fragment (app-

materials and methods
experimental design
the study was conducted in accordance with the european
communities council directives (861609/eec). all the experiments conformed to the guidelines on the handling and training
of laboratory animals. the experimental design of postnatal
 xxxd3105xxx  deficiency was the same as that described by husson et
al. (2003). weaned male wistar rats were purchased from harlan
(gannat, france). they were maintained in a room with a constant
airflow system, controlled temperature (21 – 23-c) and a 12 h light/
dark cycle. the rats were allowed ad libitum access to food and tap
water and divided into two experimental groups:  xxxd3105xxx 
deficient (twenty animals); control (ten animals). the control diet
was the same as the vitamin-a-deficient diet plus  xxxd3105xxx 
(1515.15 er/kg diet).
animals were fed these diets for 10 or 13 weeks. at this time,
some of depleted rats were injected daily (150 ag/kg body weight)
for 4 days with  xxxd3417xxx  (all-trans ra; sigma no. r2625) or
vehicle only. control rats were injected with vehicle. ra was
dissolved in a mixture containing polyethyleneglycol/nacl/ethanol
(70/20/10).
quantification of mrna
rats of the different groups (controls rats, vad rats, and
vad rats treated by ra) were sacrificed by decapitation. the
brain was rapidly removed and stored at 80-c or individual
sections (hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex) were
dissected out and then stored at
80-c for subsequent
analysis.
extraction of rna was conducted using an extraction kit (rna
plus, q.bio gene, illkirch, france). the preparation of cdna and
quantification of mrna by real-time pcr were performed as
described in previous studies (husson et al., 2003; redonnet et al.,
2002). the oligonucleotides primers for  xxxg861xxx  (housekeeping
gene) and rarh are the same as those previously used (husson et
al., 2004). the forward and reverse primer sequences for app695
were 5v-tggaggaggtagtccgagttccc, nt 863– 885 and 5vctctttggctttctggaaatggg, nt 978 – 956 (shivers et al.,
1988), for app770 – 751 were 5v-ctcccgctggtactttgatgtcac, nt 937 – 960 and 5v-ctctttggctttctggaaatggg, nt
1213 – 1191 (feng et al., unpublished), for bace were 5vagacgctcaacatcctggtg, nt 684 – 703 and 5vcctgggtgtagggcacatac, nt 830 – 811 (kitazume et al.,
2003). primers were purchased from genset (paris, france). the
results were normalized by the ratio of the relative concentration of
target to that of  xxxg861xxx  in the same sample.
western blot analysis
rats of the different groups (controls rats, vad rats, and vad
rats treated by ra) were sacrificed by decapitation. the brain was
rapidly removed, and individual regions (hippocampus, striatum
and cerebral cortex) were dissected out and stored at 80-c for
subsequent analysis.

western blot analysis was performed as previously described
(vingtdeux et al., 2005) with minor modifications. brain tissue of
the different groups was homogenized in laemmli sample buffer.
the same quantity of total brain proteins (60 ag/lane) was loaded
on a 16% tris – tricine sds-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane at 3 ma/cm2 per gel using the semidry
trans-blot sd bio-rad system (170 – 3940) (bio-rad laboratories,
munich, germany). proteins were reversibly stained with ponceau
red to check the quality of the transfer. the membranes were
preblocked in 0.15 m tris – hcl ph 8.0, 1.39 m nacl, 5% tween20 (v/v) and 5% (w/v) of non-fat milk for 1 h, incubated overnight
at 4-c with primary antibody and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with secondary antibody. the primary antibody used
(appcter-c17; 1/2000; a kind gift from andré delacourte, lille,
france) was a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the last 17
amino acids of the human app sequence (sergeant et al., 2002).
the app-ctf bands detected corresponded to app-hctf and
app-hvctf (products of the h-secretase bace), app-actf (the
a-secretase product), and to their respective phosphorylated forms,
app-hctfp, app-hvctfp, and app-actfp (fig. 2a). relative
level of h-tubulin, the internal control, was determined in these
experimental conditions. immunoreactive polypeptide bands were
visualized enzymatically with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-rabbit antibody. the h-tubulin antibody and the secondary
antibodies were from sigma immunochemical (saint quentin
fallavier, france). the staining intensity of protein bands was
determined using quantity one, quantification software (bio-rad
laboratories, usa). the relative levels in proteins in vad rats
treated with ra or not were determined as a percentage of the
same proteins in control rats.
proteins
the concentration of proteins was determined according to
bradford (1976) using a bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad laboratories, munich, germany).
statistical analysis
values are given as means and standard errors of the mean
(sem). the statistical significance of differences between means
was calculated by anova followed by an appropriate post hoc
test (fisher’s lsd test) using statgraphics plus software
(manugistics, inc., usa). p values <0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.

results
previous study showed that  xxxd3105xxx -free diet consumption
for 10 weeks correspond to the time course of  xxxd3105xxx 
depletion in rat (husson et al., 2003). following this period, the
serum retinol concentration as well as liver retinol concentration
significantly decreased in  xxxd3105xxx  deprived rats compared to
controls. retinyl palmitate was almost undetectable in vitamin-adeficient rat liver.
in the present study, animals were fed a  xxxd3105xxx -free diet
for 10 or 13 weeks, before the onset of apparent disease. fig. 3
shows that the growth of the  xxxd3105xxx  deprived rats slowed
down effectively after 10 weeks and reached a plateau until 13
weeks.

the level of rarh mrna was lower in rat brain after 10 or 13
weeks of  xxxd3105xxx -free diet consumption compared to control rat
brain (approximately 36% for both time periods tested).
concerning the ra target genes, no change was observed in the
mrna levels of app695 and app770 – 751 in the brain between
control and depleted groups after 10 weeks. after 13 weeks of
 xxxd3105xxx -free diet, the abundance of app695 was significantly
reduced ( 14%), whereas the level of app770 – 751 mrna was
unchanged.
effects of ra administration on ra nuclear receptor and amyloid

ra administration restored the depleted diet-related decreased

isoform. indeed, ra treatment up-regulated the amount of
rarh mrna (+33% and +46% after 10 and 13 weeks,
respectively) and app695 (+45% and +39% after 10 and 13
weeks, respectively) mrna at least at the control level.

discussion
the present study demonstrated that hypo-activity of the
retinoid signaling pathway leads to decreased expression of
app695, bace, and app-ctf in whole brain and cortex of rats
fed a  xxxd3105xxx -free diet for 13 weeks. administration of ra to
these  xxxd3105xxx -deprived rats restored the amounts of both ra
nuclear receptor and related gene involved in the amyloid
deposits.
expression of ra nuclear receptor and target genes in the brain of
rats deprived of  xxxd3105xxx  for 10 or 13 weeks
as shown in our previous study after 10 weeks of diet (husson
et al., 2003), rats fed a  xxxd3105xxx -free diet for 13 weeks displayed a
significant hypo-expression of rarh in whole brain.
whereas no modification was observed concerning the amount
of app mrna after 10 weeks of depleted diet, alteration of the
 xxxd3105xxx  signaling pathway was accompanied by a decreased
amount of app695 mrna in the whole brain after 13 weeks. this
decreased expression may be the result of decreased ra
bioavailability together with the lower amount of rarh. indeed
in vitro studies have shown that the app695 isoform may be
specifically regulated by ra treatment (hung et al., 1992; yang et
al., 1998; murray and ihwe, 2003). there is a longstanding
controversy as to which app transcript is up- or down-regulated in
amyloidogenic diseases. nevertheless, loss of the brain-specific
app695 has been described in the ad cortex and hippocampus
(johnson et al., 1988, 1989). present data revealed that the hypoexpression of app695 observed in rat brain appears to be depend
on the extent of  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency. in the paper husson et al.
(2003), we have hypothesized that after 10 weeks of depleted diet,
 xxxd3105xxx  deficiency seems to be associated with adaptative
processes, so-called allostatic state, suggesting that many physiological functions are mobilized and become stabilized at new levels
far from homeostatic equilibrium. this process of apparent stability
can return from homeostatic state or can lead to breakdown and
illness with a continuing lack (sterling and eyer, 1988). thus, in
our opinion, after 13 weeks of deprived diet, the flexibility to
maintain stability through allostatic state decreased leading to
apparent signs of amyloid deposits characterized, in the present
study, by a decreased amount of app695 mrna.

in order to continue with this investigation, a more precise
study of the etiology of the amyloid deposit within a prolonged
 xxxd3105xxx  deficiency (13 weeks) was performed. the expression of
rarh and that of ra related genes encoding for proteins which
are markers of this process were examined simultaneously, in brain
subfields, i.e., striatum, hippocampus, and cortex. the app, the hsite app-cleaving enzyme (bace) that cleaves the app695, and
its products, the app c-terminal fragments (app-hctf and apphvctf) were studied. these precursors of the peptide ah are now
considered to be potential early markers for the biological
diagnosis of ad (sergeant et al., 2002). the striatum was chosen
because many authors have suggested a predominant role of
retinoids in gene regulatory events in this subfield in adults, due to
a specific expression pattern of retinoid-binding protein and
aldehyde dehydrogenase as well as a high concentration of ra
in this region (mccaffery and dräger, 1994; krezel et al., 1999;
zetterström et al., 1999; wagner et al., 2002). the hippocampus
and the cortex are two regions of the brain that exhibit a high
degree of vulnerability to neuro-degeneration and which develop
amyloid plaques in ad (edelberg and wei, 1996; vickers et al.,
2000; irizarry et al., 2001; duyckaerts, 2004).
after 13 weeks of  xxxd3105xxx -free diet, the decrease in the
rarh mrna level observed in the striatum of rats was consistent
with previous work obtained in rats fed a  xxxd3105xxx  deprived diet
for 10 weeks (husson et al., 2004). in addition, in the present
study, a lower amount of rarh mrna was observed in the cortex
of vad rats, which was not observed after 10 weeks of deprived
diet. thus, interestingly, the expression of  xxxd3105xxx  nuclear
receptors was altered at first in the striatum, a region highly
sensitive to  xxxd3105xxx  bioavailability, and somewhat later in the
cortex. as observed in the whole brain, the decreased expression of
rarh mrna level was accompanied by hypo-expression of
app695. this hypo-expression was specific to the cortex in this
model. the region-specific alteration of the expression of app695
was consistent with data reported by several authors showing that,
in spite of the vulnerability of the hippocampus associated with ad
(mishizen-eberz et al., 2004), amyloid process but also ad
essentially first affects the integrity of cortical circuitry (vickers et
al., 2000; thal and braak, 2005). indeed, these last authors
described five phases in human brain ah deposits evolution. the
first stage of ah deposition begins in the exclusively neocortex
before it expands to further areas and regions. the hierarchical
pattern reflects the clinical gravity of the disease. moreover, the
lower level of app695 mrna in the cortex was in accordance
with an increase in the ratio app770 – 751/app695. indeed
johnson et al. (1989) suggested that an increased ratio of app751/app695 is an important clue to the etiology of amyloid
deposition and also of plaque formation in ad.
like rarh and app695, the bace mrna content decreased
in the cortex of vad rats compared to the controls. these results
are coherent with satoh and kuroda (2000), who observed a
positive regulation of bace by ra in vitro. moreover, irizarry et
al. (2001) have shown colocalization of app, bace, and amyloid
deposit, especially in the cortex. the decreased level of bace
mrna is surprising in that a lot of data have shown an increased
activity and protein level of bace in the brain of ad patients
(holsinger et al., 2002; zohar et al., 2003; fukumoto et al., 2004).
nevertheless, benjannet et al. (2001) have suggested that the
activity rate of bace is related to numerous posttranslational
modifications. furthermore, other authors report any change in
mrna level of bace in the brain of ad patients who suffer a

high load of ah plaque formation (gatta et al., 2002; zohar et al.,
2005). concerning the amount of app-hctf, the results showed
no change in protein content in the hippocampus or in the
striatum. this protein level was not quantifiable in the cortex.
however, the 13-week vitamin-a-deficient rats exhibited a cortex
specific decrease in the app-ctf phosphorylated forms, i.e.,
app-hctfp, app-hvctfp, and concomitantly of app-actf.
this observation is consistent with the decreased expression of
app695, bace, and rarh in the same brain area. the
phosphorylated forms of app-hctf and app-hvctf seem to
play a determining role in ctf processing leading to neuritic
plaques formation, by facilitating their own cleavage into ah by
the g-secretase (vingtdeux et al., 2005).
in this way, the reduced levels of phosphorylated h- and hvctf,
which occurred in the cortex when  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency was
extended, might be due to a rise in g-secretase activity and so
might reveal an increased in ah formation. indeed, some reports
revealed an inverse relationship between g-secretase and a- and
hctf: (i) an elevation in the steady-state levels of a- and hctf in
 xxxg1857xxx  gene knockout mice (a member of the g-secretase complex)
(sinha, 2002) and (ii) an accumulation of the g-secretase product
(gctf) and a concomitant reduction in levels of both a- and hctf
in different cell lines that over express  xxxg1857xxx  (kim et al., 2003).
moreover, the decreased amount of protein of the constitutively
fragment actf (the a-secretase product, generated during the
physiological pathway), noted in the cortex of vitamin-a-deficient
rats, might reflect an underlying neuropathic process, whereby
app695 is converted to hctf and so ah rather than to actf.
indeed, such a process has been described in ad patients (edelberg
and wei, 1996). this hypothesis was supported by recent reports
suggesting an ra-associated shift of app processing towards the
alpha secretase pathway (holback et al., 2005; prinzen et al.,
2005).
together, these data demonstrated that hypo-activity of the
retinoid signaling pathway leads to decreased expression of
app695, bace, and app-ctf in whole brain and cortex of rats
fed a  xxxd3105xxx -free diet for 13 weeks. these results are coherent
with those of corcoran et al. (2004), showing that a loss in ra
function can lead to a h amyloid deposition in the adult rat.
effect of ra administration on the expression of ra nuclear
receptor and target genes in the brain of  xxxd3105xxx  deprived rats
for 10 or 13 weeks
as shown previously, administration of ra to vitamin-adeficient rats induces an up-regulation of its own nuclear receptors
and this occurs whatever the duration (10 or 13 weeks) of the
deficiency (husson et al., 2003, 2004). except the rarh
expression about which the recovery effect of ra was exerted in
the striatum and the cortex, other effects of ra administration to
vitamin-a-deficient animals were only observed in the cortex. the
in vivo effect of ra administration on the expression of app695
constituted original results in that a similar up-regulation has been
only observed in studies using in vitro models (konig et al., 1990;
hung et al., 1992; yang et al., 1998; murray and ihwe, 2003). this
phenomenon occurred in whole brain and in the cortex of 13 week
vitamin-a-deficient rats, areas that also exhibited altered app695
expression. surprisingly, if  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency remained without
effect on the abundance of app770 mrna, ra treatment of
vitamin-a-deficient animals induced an increase in it in the whole
brain. the up-regulation of this app isoform by ra has been

shown in vitro (yoshikawa et al., 1990). as previously observed in
vitro, administration of ra reversed hypo-expression of bace
(satoh and kuroda, 2000). in the same way, the reduced amounts
of the app-ctf studied were normalized by ra treatment in the
cortex. therefore, it was hypothesized that ra administration
restores the equilibrium between the constitutive and the amyloidogenic pathways. the normalization effect of ra on the
app770 – 751/app695 ratio agrees with this hypothesis.
all these results, showing a recovery effect in amyloid deposits
indicators by treatment of  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency with ra, lead to
the conclusion that a collapse in retinoid signaling is, at least in
part, involved in the amyloid deposit process and that, to a certain
extent, ra treatment is able to reverse such a process.

conclusion
the present data reveal a  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency-related
dysregulation of the amyloidogenic pathway in the cortex of rats,
which is known to be the first brain area altered by ad
development. in this region, the decrease of app695 and bace
mrna and app-ctf protein levels observed was restored by ra
administration. these results complement earlier data revealing the
involvement of retinoid signaling in the etiology of alzheimer
diseases (goodman and pardee, 2003; corcoran et al., 2004) and
argue for the potent anti-amyloidogenic effect of  xxxd3105xxx 
suggested, to date, by in vitro studies (ono et al., 2004). it has
been hypothesized that  xxxd3105xxx  may protect neurons against
oxidative stress, which may result from excessive production of
ah (grundman and delaney, 2002). our present study, using
animal model, suggests that  xxxd3105xxx  may prevent the development of ad not only by scavenging reactive oxygen species, but
also by directly inhibiting the deposition of ah in the brain via the
regulation of target gene involved in amyloidogenic pathway.
moreover, the present results are coherent with studies showing
that ad patients display low  xxxd3105xxx  serum concentrations
(bourdel-marchasson et al., 2001; rinaldi et al., 2003).
together, these data argue for an important role of  xxxd3105xxx  via
its nuclear receptors in the multiple processes involved in
regulating plaque formation and so could be considered as a key
molecule for development of therapies for ad. attenuating ah
mediated neuro-degeneration is today of major consideration as a
potential treatment of ad.
