inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  suppresses the cardinal features of asthma via inhibition of airway dendritic cell function.  inhalation of  xxxd2331xxx , a stable prostacyclin (pgi(2)) analog, is a well-accepted and safe treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. although  xxxd2331xxx  mainly acts as a vasodilator by binding to the i prostanoid (ip) receptor, recent evidence suggests that signaling via this receptor also has antiinflammatory effects through unclear mechanisms. here we show in a murine model of asthma that  xxxd2331xxx  inhalation suppressed the cardinal features of asthma when given during the priming or challenge phase. as a mechanism of action,  xxxd2331xxx  interfered with the function of lung myeloid dcs, critical antigen-presenting cells of the airways.  xxxd2331xxx  treatment inhibited the maturation and migration of lung dcs to the mediastinal lns, thereby abolishing the induction of an allergen-specific th2 response in these nodes. the effect of  xxxd2331xxx  was dc autonomous, as  xxxd2331xxx -treated dcs no longer induced th2 differentiation from naive t cells or boosted effector cytokine production in primed th2 cells. these data should pave the way for a clinical effectiveness study using inhaled  xxxd2331xxx  for the treatment of asthma.
