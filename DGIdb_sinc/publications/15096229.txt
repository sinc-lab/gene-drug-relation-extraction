triptans are commonly used anti-migraine drugs and show agonist action mainly
at serotonin 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptors. it is not known whether frequent or long-term
treatment with these drugs would alter 5-ht receptor function. we investigated
the effects of protracted (14–18 days) sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  treatment
in rats on 5-ht1 receptor mrna expression and function in tissues related to
migraine pathophysiology. rt-pcr analysis revealed that 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptor
mrna was reduced in the trigeminal ganglion after treatment with either  xxxd3263xxx 
(reduction by: sumatriptan 39% and  xxxd3562xxx  61% for 5-ht1b; 60% vs 41% for
 xxxg1110xxx ; 32% vs 68% for  xxxg1112xxx ). sumatriptan attenuated  xxxg1110xxx  receptor mrna
by 49% in the basilar artery, whereas  xxxd3562xxx  reduced 5-ht1b mrna in this
tissue by 70%. no change in 5-ht1 receptor mrna expression was observed in
coronary artery and dura mater. chronic  xxxd3263xxx  treatment had no effect in two
functional assays [sumatriptan mediated inhibition (50 mg/kg, i.p.) of electrically
induced plasma protein extravasation in dura mater and 5-nonyloxytryptaminestimulated [35s]guanosine-5′-o-(3-thio)triphosphate binding in substantia nigra].
furthermore, vasoconstriction to 5-ht in isolated basilar artery was not affected
by chronic  xxxd3263xxx  treatment, while it was slightly reduced in coronary artery. we
conclude that, although our treatment protocol altered mrna receptor expression
in several tissues relevant to migraine pathophysiology, it did not attenuate 5-ht1
receptor-dependent functions in rats.  5-ht1 receptor, drug overuse, protein

introduction
anti-migraine drugs such as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), ergot alkaloids and
triptans, can lead to drug-induced headache in
subjects with a primary headache disorder (e.g.
migraine) (1, 2). interestingly, patients respond
favourably to these drugs prior to the development
of drug-induced headache. this phenomenon
accounts for 8–10% of patients in specialized headache clinics and about 1% of the general population,
but its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms
398

are not known (3). the most obvious possibilities
are receptor desensitization, as demonstrated, for
instance, in cancer pain following treatment with
opioids, or altered receptor expression following
recurrent agonist exposure (4). both phenomena
could lead to a vicious circle in susceptible individuals resulting in increased drug intake without pain
relief. epidemiological data from a danish study in
migraineurs showed a reduced response rate (33%)
to sumatriptan in frequent users in contrast to lowpeak users (56%), indicative of a loss of drug effect
in the aforementioned population (5). in contrast,

chronic  xxxd3263xxx  treatment in rats
studies in episodic cluster headache patients with an
overuse of sumatriptan (greater than three injections
of 6 mg/day) did not reveal tachyphylaxis or tolerance in this population (6).
in a large retrospective study, sumatriptan has
been shown to account for 10% of drug-induced
headaches between 1993 and 1999 (7). while most
commonly used anti-migraine substances bind to a
variety of receptors, triptans such as sumatriptan
bind preferentially to 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptors (8, 9) and
thus offer the possibility of studying the effects of
chronic agonist treatment on a limited number of
potential targets. to our knowledge, no animal studies have been performed to investigate mechanisms
which may contribute to the development of druginduced headache, or to assess the functional effects
of repeated treatment with abortive anti-migraine
drugs.
although widely and successfully used for the
treatment of primary headache disorders, it is not
known whether a frequent use of 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptor agonists can lead to reduced receptor mrna
expression, receptor desensitization or a change
in receptor functional properties. therefore, we
investigated the effects of 5-ht1b/1d agonist treatment in rats injected repeatedly with  xxxd3562xxx  or
sumatriptan and determined whether this treatment
led to reduced 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptor mrna expression in tissues related to migraine pathophysiology
or pharmacotherapy, such as the dura mater, trigeminal ganglion and cerebral and cardiac blood vessels
[for review see (10)]. to assess the functional consequences of frequent agonist treatment, we studied
the contractile reactivity of the basilar and coronary
arteries in an in vitro preparation, the efficacy of
sumatriptan to reduce plasma protein extravasation,
a well-established marker of trigeminal nerve activation in the dura mater and gtpgammas binding in substantia nigra.

materials and methods
experimental animals
animal experiments were approved by the massachusetts general hospital, committee on research,
subcommittee on research animal care. male sprague dawley rats (150–170 g; charles river, wilmington, ma, usa) were injected intraperitoneally twice
a day with either sumatriptan (300 µg/kg),  xxxd3562xxx  (100 µg/kg) or vehicle. all substances were
dissolved in 25% beta-cyclodextrin in saline (nacl
0.9%) and a volume of 100 µl was injected each time.
although osmotic pumps would have resulted in

stable drug levels we decided to inject the rats twice
a day in order to mimic the typical treatment paradigm of a patient. we also chose this treatment regimen because these  xxxd3263xxx  doses have been found to
fully inhibit neurogenic dural plasma extravasation
and c-fos expression in the trigeminal nucleus, two
models predictive for anti-migraine efficacy (11–13).
rats were weighted every third day to adjust the
drug dose for weight change. the treatment was
performed for 14–18 days and animals were not
injected the evening before sacrifice. sumatriptan
was kindly provided by glaxosmithkline and
 xxxd3562xxx  by astrazeneca.

rt-pcr
rats were perfused transcardially with 250 ml cold
normal saline, the dura mater, trigeminal ganglia
(tg), basilar and coronary arteries were dissected
out and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. total
rna from vessels was isolated using a rneasy
mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca, usa) while the rna
from tg and dura mater was isolated using the trizol (gibco, carlsbad, ca, usa) extraction method
according to the manufacturers’ instruction. concentration and purity of rna was determined by
spectrophotometry (beckman spectrophotometer
bu 640) and gel electrophoresis, respectively.
rna was reverse-transcribed to first-strand dna
with an omniscript™ kit kit (qiagen), using random
priming. one microlitre of cdna was used for polymerase chain reaction (pcr). cdna was amplified
in a programmable thermal cycler (mj research,
cambridge, ma, usa). the reaction mixture contained 1 µl cdna, 200 µm dntp, 10 × reaction buffer,
25 u redtaq dna polymerase (sigma, st louis,
mo, usa), 18.75 µl h2o and 200 µm deoxynucleotides. the pcr primer sequences were: 3′-ccag
gtggtctgcgacttct-5′ sense and 5′-agag
gacgtggtcggtgttc-3′ antisense for r5-ht1b
receptors, 3′-ctctccaatgccttcgtact-5′ sense
and 5′-ggccatacaggataatgagc-3′ antisense
for r5-ht1d receptors and 3′-aggatgaaaac
cagtt-5′ sense and 5′-cataatccaactctctct
cac-3′ antisense for r5-ht1f. pcr was initiated for
all receptors with a 5-min denaturation at 95°c for
5 min followed by cycles of 45 s at 95°c, 30 s at 60°c
and 45 s at 72°c (40 cycles for 5-ht1b; 42 cycles for
 xxxg1110xxx ; 41 cycles for  xxxg1112xxx ). pcr products were
separated by gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose
gel in tae buffer containing ethidium bromide
and visualized with an imaging system (mcid
m4, imaging research, st catharines, ont., canada).

the optical intensity of the bands for the 5-ht1b/d/f
pcr products by the intensity of the band for the
housekeeping gene gadph. primers for gadph
were
3′-taaaagggcatcctgggctacact-5′
sense and 5′-ttactccttggaggccatgt-3′ antisense and pcr was initiated with a 5-min denaturation at 95°c and 29 cycles through 94°c for 30 s,
55°c for 15 s., and 72°c for 1 min.
pcr products from trigeminal ganglia tissue for
all receptors investigated in this study were
sequenced. pcr products were purified with
qiaquick pcr purification kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) and sequenced with dye (cy5) primer chemistry using primer cycle sequencing kit (amersham
biosciences, braunschweig, germany) in combination with an automated alfexpress dna sequencer
(pharmacia biotech, freiburg, germany). the
sequences were compared with entries in genbank
using the blast program. for each product, the correspondence to the targeted gene was confirmed
(data not shown).

plasma protein extravasation
rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg; i.p.) and prepared as described previously (14). briefly, 50 µci [125i]-bsa (new england
nuclear, boston, ma, usa) were injected into the
femoral vein. rats were placed into a stereotaxic
frame, the skull was exposed and two burr holes were
carefully drilled above the trigeminal ganglia 2.8 mm
posteriorly and 3.2 mm laterally to bregma. two
stainless steel bipolar electrodes were lowered
9.2 mm from the dura in the ganglia and the right
trigeminal ganglion was stimulated for 5 min (5hz,
5 ms, 1.2 ma, world precision instruments, hartford,
ct, usa). animals were killed 5 min after stimulation by a 2-min transcardiac perfusion with normal
saline at a constant perfusion pressure of 100 mmhg.
the dura was dissected out, weighted and counted
for radioactivity in a gamma counter (cobra ii, packard instruments, downers grove, il, usa). radioactivity (cpm/mg dura wet weight) was expressed as a
ratio between the stimulated and unstimulated side.
in these experiments, sumatriptan was administered 15 min before ganglion stimulation. first, we
determined a dose–response for plasma protein inhibition following sumatriptan pre-treatment (50, 75,
100 µg/kg i.v.; n = 5 per group) in naive rats. as
50 µg/kg sumatriptan reduced leakage submaximally, this dose was selected to investigate the effect
of sumatriptan on plasma protein extravasation in
chronically treated animals (n = 6 per group).

isolated arteries
rats were anaesthetized with chloroform (fisher
scientific, pittsburgh, pa, usa) and killed by
decapitation. the dura mater and trigeminal ganglia were dissected out, frozen in liquid nitrogen
and further processed for rt-pcr as described
above. the brain and heart were removed immediately and immersed in physiological solution (composition, in mm: nacl, 118; kcl, 4.6; nahco3, 25;
 xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; kh2po4, 1.2; cacl2, 2.5; glucose, 10;
edta, 0.025; ph 7.4 at 37°c). the basilar and coronary arteries were dissected out under a microscope. arterial segments (1.5–2-mm long) were
threaded onto 40-µm stainless steel wires and
mounted in a isometric myograph (610 m, danish
myo technology, denmark). each preparation was
equilibrated unstretched, for 30 min, in physiological solution at 37°c and aerated with a gas mixture
of 95% o2 – 5% co2. the normalized passive resting
force and the corresponding diameter were then
determined for each preparation from its own
length-pressure curve, according to mulvany and
halpern (15). contractile responses were recorded
using a data acquisition and recording software
(myodaq and myodata, danish myo technology).
after normalization and 30-min equilibration in
physiological solution, the preparations were stimulated with a 100-mm kcl-depolarizing solution
(composition, mm: nacl, 22.6; kcl, 100; nahco3,
25;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; kh2po4, 1.2; cacl2, 2.5; glucose, 10;
edta, 0.025, ph 7.4 at 37°c). after wash-out and
30-min recovery, they were exposed to cumulative
concentrations of serotonin (5-ht, 1 nm – 10 µm) or
the 5-ht1 receptor agonist 5-carboxamido,
tryptamine (5-ct 1 nm – 10 µm; sigma-rbi, natick,
ma, usa) (16).

autoradiography
autoradiography was performed in brain tissue
from rats that were used for rt-pcr studies.
[35s]gtpgammas binding (new england nuclear, boston,
ma, usa) was visualized as described (17). brainstem tissue sections 10 µm-thick were incubated for
15 min at room temperature in 50 mm hepes
(ph 7.5) containing 100 mm nacl, 1 mm mgcl2,
0.2 mm egta and 0.3 mm dtt and for a further
15 min in the same buffer supplemented with 2 mm
gdp. agonist-stimulated binding was determined
by incubating the sections for 60 min at 30°c in
buffer containing 2 mm gdp, 0.1 nm [35s]gtpgammas and
the appropriate concentration of the selective 5ht1b/1d receptor agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine

chronic  xxxd3263xxx  treatment in rats
(sigma-rbi). non-specific binding was assessed by
including 10 µm unlabelled gtpgammas in the incubation
buffer and was not significantly different from film
background (not shown). slides were washed in ice
cold 50 mm hepes (containing 100 mm nacl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 0.2 mm egta), dipped in ice-cold distilled
water, dried under a stream of cold air and exposed
to hyperfilm betamax for 48 h. [35s]gtpgammas binding was
assessed by measuring the optical density of the
autoradiograms over selected brain regions using a
computerized image analysis system (mcid m4,
imaging res. inc., canada). 14c-polymer standards
(amersham, piscataway, nj, usa) were used for
calibration. agonist-induced [35s]gtpgammas binding is
expressed as percentage of basal binding.

trigeminal ganglion stimulation

data are expressed as mean values ± s.d. for all data
except results from isolated artery studies which
are expressed as mean values ± s.e. comparisons
between groups were performed using one way
anova followed turkey’s protected t-test. statistical
significance was assumed when p < 0.05.

unilateral electrical stimulation of the trigeminal
ganglion increased leakage of [125i]bsa within
ipsilateral dura mater in naive animals. the
extravasation ratio between stimulated and control
sides was 1.69 ± 0.13 (n = 6). sumatriptan pretreatment reduced the ratio dose–dependently to
1.25 ± 0.05 (50 µg/kg sumatriptan; p < 0.05; n = 6)
and 1.07 ± 0.10 (100 µg/kg sumatriptan; p < 0.05;
n = 6) in naive rats (fig. 2). because we expected
desensitization of 5-ht1 receptors or reduced receptor expression following chronic  xxxd3263xxx  treatment,
and thus a rightward shift in the response to acute
sumatriptan administration after tg stimulation, a
dose of 50 µg/kg sumatriptan was chosen for further
experiment. sumatriptan administration (50 µg/kg)
resulted in a ratio of 1.30 ± 0.05 (n = 6) in animals
chronically treated with vehicle, which was not different from the effects in naive rats. this ratio was
not changed in rats treated chronically with
sumatriptan [1.21 ± 0.06 (n = 6)] or  xxxd3562xxx 
[1.27 ± 0.06 (n = 6)] (p > 0.05 for all acute sumatriptan treatment groups with respect to control; fig. 2).

statistical analysis

the effect of daily injections with  xxxd3562xxx 
(n = 9) and sumatriptan (n = 9) (twice a day for
14–18 days) on mrna expression for 5-ht1b/1d/1f
receptors was investigated in various tissues relevant to migraine pathophysiology and/or pharmacotherapy (figs 1a–e). the pcr reaction
products showed a single band of the expected
size for each receptor. in the trigeminal ganglion,
sumatriptan
and
 xxxd3562xxx ,
significantly
reduced mrna expression for 5-ht1b/d/f receptors
compared with vehicle treated animals (n = 8;
p < 0.05). in basilar artery,  xxxg1109xxx  mrna
was reduced following  xxxd3562xxx , while
sumatriptan treatment reduced the mrna for
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors; although sumatriptan also
decreased 5-ht1b mrna in the basilar artery, statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.07).
chronic sumatriptan or  xxxd3562xxx  application
did not cause any significant changes in coronary
arteries for the 5-ht1 receptor subtypes investigated. in dura mater  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna could
not be detected using two different sets of primers
and  xxxg1110xxx  mrna was increased after sumatriptan treatment compared with vehicle and  xxxd3562xxx  treatment.

basilar arteries
5-ht and 5-ct evoked contractile responses in a
concentration-dependent manner in all treatment
groups (fig. 3). maximal contractile responses to 5ht (n = 8 for all treatment groups) were slightly
higher than that induced by 100 mm kcl, while the
responses to 5-ct (n = 8 for all treatment groups)
reached only about 50% of the kcl response. there
were no differences in basilar arteries for the pd2 or
the maximal contractile responses to 5-ht or 5-ct
between vehicle,  xxxd3562xxx  and sumatriptan
treated rats (figs 3a and b).
coronary arteries
in vehicle-treated rats, the maximal contractile
response to 5-ht was 156.7 ± 7.7% to that induced
by 100 mm kcl (n = 10). the maximal contraction
to 5-ht in  xxxd3562xxx -(114.9 ± 5.1%; n = 10) and
sumatriptan-treated rats (123.4 ± 9.5%; n = 12) was
significantly reduced compared with vehicle-treated
rats (n = 10; p < 0.05 for both treatment groups;
fig. 3c). however, the pd2 values (nm) were not different between vehicle and  xxxd3263xxx  treatment groups
(vehicle: 6.6 ± 0.1,  xxxd3562xxx  6.6 ± 0.1, sumatriptan
6.7 ± 0.1).

increasing doses of the 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonist 5nonyloxytryptamine stimulated [35s]gtpgammas binding
in substantia nigra in a concentration-dependent
manner in all treatment groups (fig. 4). the maximal

in this study, we investigated the effects of repeated
 xxxd3263xxx  administration on 5-ht1 receptor function
and mrna expression in tissues related to migraine
pathogenesis. we chose a 2-week treatment period
because this regimen has previously been found sufficient to show alterations of other 5-ht receptor
subtypes (18–20). we have shown that sumatriptan
and  xxxd3562xxx  administration can affect the
expression of 5-ht1b/1d/1f mrna in these tissues. in
contrast, none of the 5-ht1 receptor-mediated functions was altered after the treatment period (14–
18 days), with the exception of 5-ht1-mediated constriction of coronary arteries. in particular, inhibition
of plasma protein extravasation by sumatriptan was

is not different between treatment groups. in coronary artery, the maximum contractile response to 5-ht is attenuated after
treatment with either  xxxd3263xxx . in contrast, protracted  xxxd3562xxx  treatment leads to a reduced contractile response to 5-ct;

[5-nonyloxytryptamine] (nm)

figure 4 effect of increasing concentrations of the 5-ht1b/1d
receptor agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine on [ 35s]gtpgammas binding
in substantia nigra. data are expressed as per cent increased
[35s]gtpgammas binding over basal binding (error bars, mean
± standard deviation values observed between different
animals (n = 6 per group). maximal stimulations of [35s]gtpgammas
binding are 81 ± 9%, 97 ± 10% and 69 ± 8% in rat substantia
nigra following vehicle, sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx 
treatment, repectively (p > 0.05).

not attenuated following recurrent 5-ht1b/d receptor
agonist treatment. mean contractile responses of
basilar arteries to 5-ht or 5-ct, and agonist induced
gtpgammas binding in substantia nigra (an index of central  xxxg1109xxx  coupling to g proteins) were
likewise not altered. our findings indicate that a protracted sumatriptan or  xxxd3562xxx  treatment does
not alter the functions of 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptors, and
therefore would not result in a loss of clinical
efficacy.

blood vessels
basilar artery
rt-pcr studies found a consistent trend to a
decrease in 5-ht1 receptor mrna after chronic  xxxd3263xxx  treatment (see fig. 1b), whereas the contractile
properties of basilar arteries to 5-ht and the more
selective 5-ht1 receptor agonist 5-ct were not
altered. 5-ht elicits vasoconstriction in rat basilar
arteries by stimulation of a mixed receptor population of 5-ht2 and 5-ht 1b receptors (21) in agreement
with our findings that the selective 5-ht1 receptor
agonist 5-ct only constricts rat basilar artery to a
fraction of 5-ht’s maximal contractile response.
moreover, a similar discrepancy between 5-ht1
receptor mrna and 5-ht1-mediated effects has
been recently observed by hansen-schwartz et al. in
vessels maintained in organ culture. in this study,

 xxxd3241xxx  inhibited the culture induced upregulation of the response of 5-ht1b/1d receptors, but
had no significant effect on the mrna levels of these
receptors (22).
there could be two likely explanations for the fact
that the observed decrease in 5-ht1b mrna was not
accompanied by a loss of contractile activity. the
first one is that the loss of mrna was not paralleled
by a corresponding decrease in receptor protein. it is
also possible that the stimulation of only a fraction
of the vascular 5-ht1b receptors by full agonists such
as 5-ht and 5-ct results in maximal response in
control basilar arteries (receptor reserve). if this is
the case, a preserved contractile response would be
observed, even in the presence of a reduced density
of 5-ht1b receptors after protracted  xxxd3263xxx 
treatment.
coronary artery
vasoconstriction in rat coronary arteries is inhibited
by the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist  xxxd2419xxx , but not
by the 5-ht1 receptor antagonist l-propranolol, indicating that this response is mostly  xxxg1113xxx 
mediated (23). in line with a 5-ht2-dependent mechanism, the ec50 of 5-ct was lower in coronary than
in basilar artery, and much lower than that of 5-ht.
treatment with either  xxxd3263xxx  reduced the maximal
contractile response to 5-ht, while the maximal
response to 5-ct was only decreased after chronic
 xxxd3562xxx . the effect of  xxxd3263xxx  administration on
5-ht-mediated coronary constriction is unlikely to
be mediated by direct action at 5-ht2 receptors,
because triptans have virtually no affinity for these
sites (12, 24). an action at another receptor, such as
5-ht1a, which  xxxd3263xxx  can activate at therapeutic
doses (25), is also unlikely as  xxxg1108xxx  mediated constriction only accounts for a few per cent of
the 5-ht mediated contriction in rat coronary artery
(23). because  xxxd3562xxx  is a more potent constrictor than sumatriptan in the coronary artery of several species (26, 27), we speculate that  xxxd3562xxx 
may have a higher potency to desensitize the receptor subtype (probably 5-ht1b), mediating constriction to 5-ct in this vessel. interestingly, a
desensitization to 5-ht was detected after treatment
with both triptans. this could be because the contractile response to this agonist was more robust,
rendering the effect of chronic treatment more
detectable. it should be noted that chronic administration of neither  xxxd3263xxx  resulted in a detectable
reduction of 5-ht1b/d/f receptor mrna. therefore,
if changes in coronary contractile response to 5-ht1
receptor agonist are indeed mediated by 5-ht1b
receptors, these alterations are likely to occur via

chronic  xxxd3263xxx  treatment in rats
post-translational mechanisms, or at the level of
receptor coupling. as recurrent  xxxd3263xxx  administration should have led to chronic coronary constriction, it is also possible that the treatment resulted in
the down-regulation of one or several molecules
involved in the signalling of vasoconstricting agents.

plasma protein extravasation
we have previously shown that, in rats, prejunctional receptors of the 5-ht1b subtype block dural
plasma extravasation after electrical stimulation of
the trigeminal ganglion (11). as demonstrated previously, sumatriptan dose-dependently inhibited
plasma protein extravasation in dura mater following electrical trigeminal ganglion stimulation (14).
because we expected a down-regulation of 5-ht1b
receptors after recurrent  xxxd3263xxx  administration, we
chose to test a single submaximally effective dose of
sumatriptan (50 µg/kg). inhibition of protein leakage was unchanged between all groups, indicating
that repeated  xxxd3263xxx  administration did not affect
the efficacy of sumatriptan to reduce plasma protein
leakage. this finding is in line with clinical observations showing the efficacy of sumatriptan in multiple
headache attacks, even when used repeatedly in a
single day as observed in cluster headache patients
(6).
the 5-ht1b/1d receptor mrna expression was not
reduced in dura mater after chronic treatment,
which is again in accordance with the result of the
functional study. in contrast to other tissues (e.g.
trigeminal ganglion), we were not able to detect 5ht1f receptor mrna in dura mater using two different published primer pairs. we conclude that this
receptor in the rat is expressed by trigeminal neurones, and not by meningeal blood vessels or other
cell types present in this tissue, in agreement with
previous findings (28, 29).
both triptans reduced 5-ht1b/d/f mrna in the
trigeminal ganglion. in this and other tissues, it is
possible that reduced mrna did not result in significantly reduced protein expression as a result of
slow turnover of the receptor protein. this possibility, or the existence of spare receptors, might
explain why we observed an intact inhibitory effect
of sumatriptan in the plasma extravasation paradigm in the presence of decreased  xxxg1109xxx 
mrna.

not detect any change in 5-nonyloxytryptamineinduced [35s]gtpgammas binding following treatment
with both triptans. the trigeminal nucleus would
have been a brain region more relevant to migraine
pathophysiology, as it is likely to be another
important site of action of triptans (13, 30). however, this structure is not suitable for this assay
because of its high level of basal [35s]gtpgammas labelling (17). the substantia nigra was therefore
selected as a surrogate brain region because of its
large content in 5-ht1b receptors and its high signal-to-noise ratio in the [35s]gtpgammas autoradiography technique (17). although it could be argued
that the lack of effect of sumatriptan treatment on
5-nonyloxytryptamine-induced [35s]gtpgammas binding
was due to its poor ability to penetrate the blood–
brain barrier (bbb) under physiological conditions
(31),  xxxd3562xxx  is known to cross the intact bbb
(32).
the failure to detect a change in 5-ht1-receptordependent functions following  xxxd3263xxx  administration could be due the insufficient duration of the
treatment. although other studies indicate that a 2week treatment period is sufficient to detect alterations in receptor densities or coupling properties
(see above) (18, 19), we cannot rule out that a more
protracted treatment would have resulted in detectable alterations of 5-ht1 receptor functions relevant
to migraine therapy. indeed, a 30-day treatment
in rats with the 5-ht1a/ xxxg1109xxx  agonist
ru 24969 significantly reduced the density of
[125i]iodocyanopindolol-labelled 5-ht1b sites in cortex, hippocampus, striatum, brainstem, and spinal
cord (33). the non-selective agonists (m-trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine [tfmpp], but not [1-(3chlorophenyl)piperazine] (m-cpp) reduced the bmax
of cortical 5-ht1b sites. it is, however, unclear
whether these effects were caused by a direct action
on 5-ht1b receptors or by activation of another
receptor subtype.
in summary, our findings do not provide evidence for a change in 5-ht1 receptor properties
after a protracted  xxxd3263xxx  treatment (14–18 days)
in intra- and extracerebral tissues important to
migraine pathophysiology. these results are in
agreement with the finding that cluster headache
patients respond reliably to triptans, even after a
treatment period of several months. in addition, the
development of drug-induced headache in certain
individuals does not appear to be accounted for by
a desensitization of the trigemino-vascular 5-ht1
receptors to anti-migraine drugs, or endogenous
inhibitory transmitters, at least not during the time
frame we examined.
