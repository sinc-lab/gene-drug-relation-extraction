abstract.
background: hyperhomocysteinemia is a factor that predisposes to thrombosis,
and the c677t mutation in methylene- xxxd3334xxx  reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) is
known to give increased plasma homocysteine. we wanted to investigate if these
factors were overrepresented in a group of patients with central retinal vein
occlusion.
methods: 116 patients with a history of central retinal vein occlusion were
examined for the presence of hyperhomocysteinemia and the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t
mutation.
results: compared to the control groups, there was no significant increase,
neither in plasma homocysteine nor in the frequency of the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t
mutation in the patients. even when we looked selectively at the young patients,
age less than 50 years, no difference could be detected.
conclusion: it seems that neither hyperhomocysteinemia nor the  xxxg1475xxx 
c677t mutation is an important risk factor for the aetiology of central retinal
vein occlusion.
key words: central retinal vein occlusion – hyperhomocysteinemia –  xxxg1475xxx  c677t.

entral retinal vein occlusion is a disease that is fairly common in
elderly people. glaucoma, hypertension,
atherosclerosis and diabetes are factors
that are well known to be associated with
the disease (hirota et al. 1997; the eye
disease case-control study group 1996;
mcgrath et al. 1978). however, in young
people these factors are much less common than in the elderly, and many retrospective studies of young patients with a
history of central retinal vein occlusion
have been done with the intention of
finding possible predisposing factors for
thrombosis, but nothing conclusive has
emerged (walters & spalton 1990;
fong & schatz 1993; fong et al. 1991;
priluck et al. 1980). we have previously
shown that  xxxg1847xxx  resistance,

340

a hereditary disorder in the coagulation
system, predisposes for central retinal
vein occlusion in patients younger than
50 years (larsson et al. 1996), but in patients older than 50 years this overrepresentation of  xxxg1847xxx  resistance
could not be found (larsson et al. 1998).
it seems likely that other factors that influence the coagulation status predispose
to central retinal vein occlusion.
hyperhomocysteinuria is well known
to cause venous and arterial thromboembolism due to cystathionine b-synthase deficiency (mudd et al. 1985). since
thromboembolism is seen in hyperhomocysteinemia due to causes other than cystathionine b-synthase deficiency, such as
defects in the metabolism of folate and
 xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx , a high plasma concentration

of homocysteine has been considered to
cause thromboembolism (d’angelo &
selhub 1997; mccully 1983). there are
different opinions concerning the likelihood that hyperhomocysteinemia is a
risk factor for venous thromboembolic
disease. some investigations show a correlation with venous thromboembolic
disease (bienvenu et al. 1993; den heijer
et al. 1995; fermo et al. 1995; falcon et
al. 1994), but there are also reports that
do not verify this (brattstrom et al. 1991;
amundsen et al. 1995).
methylene- xxxd3334xxx  reductase
( xxxg1475xxx ) is an enzyme in the remethylation pathway of homocysteine.
deficiencies in this enzyme lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. the thermolabile mutant of  xxxg1475xxx  causes mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to defect function in the
enzyme. a number of investigations have
been done to identify whether the thermolabile mutant,  xxxg1475xxx  c677t causes
an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. some results suggest such a correlation (morita et al. 1997; kang et al.
1988, 1991; gallagher et al. 1996; kluijtmans et al. 1996), whereas others do
not (verhoef et al. 1997; anderson et al.
1997; ma et al. 1996; deloughery et al.
1996; van bockxmeer et al. 1997; christensen et al. 1997; wilcken et al. 1996;
adams et al. 1996; brugada & marian;
1997). arruda et al. have shown that
there is a correlation between homozygosity for the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation and venous thromboembolic disease
(arruda et al. 1997).
sporadic cases of patients with central
retinal vein occlusion with hyperhomocysteinemia have been reported (biousse
et al. 1997; wenzler et al. 1993), and recently loewenstein et al. described a

a o s 2000
young patient with central retinal vein occlusion that was homozygous for the
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation (loewenstein
et al. 1998), however, there have been no
previous investigations on a large number
of patients, correlating hyperhomocysteinemia and the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation with venous occlusive disease in the
eye.

methods
patients
the patient sample was recruited from
the records of the eye clinic of the lund
university hospital and comprised all
cases with central retinal vein occlusion
diagnosed during the last 4 years. 116 patients (mean age 60.1 years) were included. 37 patients were less than 50 years
mean age 40.9 years, (range 20–49). of
these 37 patients 16 (43%) were women
and 21 (57%) were male. 79 patients were
50 years or more, mean age 69.6 years,
(range 50–91). of these 79 patients 33
(42%) were women and 46 (58%) were
male. all the patients had a history of
central retinal vein occlusion.
controls
the control group for the  xxxg1475xxx 
c677t mutation comprised 140 volunteers (blood donors; 30 females and 110
males), mean age 51 years (range 34–64),
with no history of thrombosis.
the control group for plasma homocysteine comprised 153 age matched subjects that were randomly selected. 65 were
⬍50 years of age, mean age 40.9 years
(range 20–49) and 88 were 50 years or
more, mean age 69.6 years (range 50–88).
plasma homocysteine
the blood samples for homocysteine
measurement were drawn in evacuated
tubes containing edta (becton dickinson, rutherford, nj, usa), placed immediately on ice, centrifuged within 15
minutes at 2000¿g and pi4æc for 5 minutes. the supernatant was stored at
ª70æc in a sealed plastic vial until analysed. the concentration of total homocysteine and cysteine (the sum of all
homocyteinyl and cysteinyl moieties
whether in reduced or disulphide form,
free or protein-bound) was measured
with the method described previously by
anderson et al. (andersson et al. 1993)
using a kontron, high-performance,
liquid-chromatographic system (system

400; kontron instruments, zurich, switzerland).
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t
genomic dna was prepared from whole
blood using standard procedures. amplification of dna was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in a final
volume of 50 ml containing 50 mm kcl,
10 mm tris (ph 8.4 at 25æc), 1.5 mm
mgcl2, 200 mm of each deoxynucleotide
triphosphate, 0.25 mm of each primer,
100 ng of genomic dna and 2.5 mg of
amplitaq dna polymerase (perkinelmer corp., norwalk, ct). the reaction proceeded for 35 cycles with a denaturation step of 20 sec at 94æc, annealing
for 30 sec at 58æc and extension for 1
min at 72æc. the oligonucleotide primers
were chosen to yield a 225 base pair long
product containing the c677t  xxxg1475xxx 
mutation as previously described (ulvik
et al. 1997). because the c677t  xxxg1475xxx 
substitution creates a restriction site for
hinfi, the genotype was determined by
hinfi digestion, followed by agarose gel
electrophoresis and ethidium bromide
staining.

statistics
in assessing statistical significances we
used welch’s approximate two-tailed ttest, assuming different sd:s between the
controls and the patients, and the chisquare test.

results
in the group with 37 patients less than 50
years of age, the mean plasma homocysteine level was 11.6 (s.d.∫3.4 mmol/l;
range 7.3–17.7; 95% confidence interval
10.5–12.7), and in the control group with
persons ⬍50 years of age the plasma
homocysteine level was 10.9 (s.d.∫4.6
mmol/l; range 5.9–31.4; 95% confidence
interval 9.8–12.0; table 1). there is no
significant difference between the two
groups (pomega0.38, welch’s approximate ttest-test; 95% confidence interval of the
difference ª2.3–0.89).
in the group with 79 patients 50 years
or more of age, the mean plasma homocysteine level was 12.8 (s.d.∫4.6; range
6.1–26.5; 95% confidence interval 11.8–

homocysteine level was 14.0 (s.d.∫4.9

in the patients ⬍50 years of age the
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation was absent in
20 patients (54%). 16 (43%) patients were
heterozygous for the mutation and 1 (3%)
was homozygous. in the patients 50 years
or more of age, 37 (47%) did not have the
mutation, 37 (47%) were heterozygous for
the mutation, and 5 (6%) were homozygous. in the control group, 61 (44%)
persons did not have the mutation,
whereas 64 (46%) were heterozygous and
15 (11%) were homozygous. there are no
significant differences between the controls and the patients, neither in the
group less than 50 years of age (pomega0.34
chi-square test) nor in the group with patients 50 years or more (pomega0.75 chisquare test).

discussion
hyperhomocysteinemia has in some reports been shown to be correlated with
venous thromboembolic disease (bienvenu et al. 1993; den heijer et al. 1995;
fermo et al. 1995; falcon et al. 1994),
but there are also reports that do not
verify this (brattstrom et al. 1991;
amundsen et al. 1995). these studies are
not directly comparable. for example, in
the study by falcon et al. (1994) and
fermo et al. (1995), the patients were
very young (mean age 33 years), whereas
bienvenue et al. (1993) had a control
group with mean age 33 years and while
the patients’ mean age was 40 years.
den heijer et al. (1995) included patients only with recurrent thrombosis. in
these four studies, patients with thrombosis at different locations were included, whereas in the study by
amundsen et al. (1995) only patients
with deep venous thrombosis were included and the patients had a mean age
higher than in the other studies. in our
study we included only patients with
central retinal vein occlusion and divided them into two groups, ⬍50 years
of age and 50 years or more. we found
no significant difference in plasma
homocysteine between the controls and
the patients. not even when we looked

342

selectively at the young patients, less
than 50 years of age, did we find any
difference.
there have been reports of increased
risk for cardiovascular disease in persons with the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation
(morita et al. 1997; kang et al. 1988,
1991; gallagher et al. 1996; kluijtmans
et al. 1996). in one study, the presence
of the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation in a
group of patients with venous thromboembolic disease in various parts of the
body, mainly in deep large veins was
examined (arruda et al. 1997). the
study showed a correlation between
homozygosity for the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t
mutation and venous thromboembolic
disease. in our investigation which exclusively included patients with central
retinal vein occlusion, we were not able
to find any difference in the frequency
of the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation between the patients and the controls.
the retinal veins are very small compared to the vessels in the leg and in the
lung. it is possible that the etiology for
venous thromboembolic disease is not
exactly the same in very small veins (like
the retinal veins) and bigger veins (like
the ones that are involved in deep venous
thrombosis). all the other investigations
mentioned here were mainly done on patients with deep venous thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism, i. e. disease in vessels that are much bigger than the retinal
veins. this means that our investigation
is not directly comparable to the other investigations.
wenzler et al. investigated 14 patients
less than 50 years of age with central retinal vein occlusion. of these 14 patients,
2 had hyperhomocysteinemia (wenzler et
al. 1993). biousse et al. reported on one
young patient with central retinal vein occlusion with a high plasma homocysteine
(biousse et al. 1997). loewenstein et al.
reported on a young patient with central
retinal vein occlusion that was homozygous for the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation
(loewenstein et al. 1998). in our investigation on a large number of patients and
with a control group, we have not been
able to show that either hyperhomocysteinemia or the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation are overrepresented in patients with
central retinal vein occlusion. not even in
the group of patients less than 50 years
of age did we find any overrepresentation
of these two factors.
in conclusion we have shown that neither hyperhomocysteinemia nor the
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t mutation seem to be im-

portant factors in the etiology to central
retinal vein occlusion.
