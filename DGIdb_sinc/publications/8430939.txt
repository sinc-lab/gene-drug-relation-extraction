effect of topically applied  xxxd1830xxx  bromide and  xxxd1962xxx  iodide on intraocular pressure and pupil size in beagles with normotensive eyes an...  topically applied  xxxd1830xxx  bromide (0.125 and 0.25%) and  xxxd1962xxx  iodide (0.125 and 0.25%) solutions were evaluated in beagles with normotensive eyes and beagles with inherited glaucoma. in single-dose studies, the effects of intraocular pressure (iop) and pupil size (ps) were measured in eyes before drug treatment and in drug- and nondrug-treated eyes. both concentrations of the 2 drugs induced long-term miosis and decrease in iop in normotensive eyes of beagles and of eyes of beagles with inherited glaucoma.  xxxd1830xxx  bromide (0.125 and 0.5%) decreased iop for 49 and 55 hours, respectively.  xxxd1962xxx  iodide (0.125 and 0.5%) reduced iop for 25 and 53 hours, respectively. the miosis associated with both concentrations of the 2 drugs generally paralleled the decreases in iop.
