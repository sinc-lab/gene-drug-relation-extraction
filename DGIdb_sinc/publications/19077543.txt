evidence supports a role for the tetrodotoxin-sensitive  xxxg2030xxx 
and the tetrodotoxin-resistant  xxxg2018xxx  in the pathogenesis of
pain.  xxxd3083xxx , an anti-ischemic drug, has been shown to block
cardiac ( xxxg2028xxx ) late sodium current (ina). in this study, wholecell patch-clamp techniques were used to determine the effects
of  xxxd3083xxx  on human  xxxg2030xxx  (hnav1.7 +  xxxg836xxx  subunits) and rat
 xxxg2018xxx  (rnav1.8) channels expressed in hek293 and nd7-23
cells, respectively.  xxxd3083xxx  reduced hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 ina
with ic50 values of 10.3 and 21.5 mum (holding potential = -120
or -100 mv, respectively). the potency of ina block by  xxxd3083xxx 
increased to 3.2 and 4.3 mum when 5-sec depolarizing prepulses to
-70 (hnav1.7) and -40 (rnav1.8) mv were applied.  xxxd3083xxx 
caused a preferential hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state fast,
intermediate and slow inactivation of hnav1.7 and intermediate
and slow inactivation of rnav1.8, suggesting preferential interaction of the drug with the inactivated states of both channels.
 xxxd3083xxx  (30 mum) caused a use-dependent block (10-msec pulses
at 1, 2 and 5 hz) of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 ina and significantly
accelerated the onset of, and slowed the recovery from inactivation,
of both channels. an increase of depolarizing pulse duration from
3 to 200 msec did not affect the use-dependent block of ina by 100
mum  xxxd3083xxx . taken together, the data suggest that  xxxd3083xxx 
blocks the open state and may interact with the inactivated states of
 xxxg2030xxx  and  xxxg2018xxx  channels. the state-and use-dependent modulation of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 na+ channels by  xxxd3083xxx  could
lead to an increased effect of the drug at high firing frequencies, as
in injured neurons.

prolonged depolarization, na+ channels progressively enter slow
inactivated states with lifetimes ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds.1 predominantly, voltage-gated na+
channels are heterodimers, composed of an alpha-subunit (~260 kda)
and beta (auxiliary) subunits (33–39 kda). ten isoforms of na+ channel
alpha-subunits ( xxxg2020xxx –1.9, nax) have been identified by cloning and
expression.2,3 despite amino acid sequence similarities within the
na+ channel family, isoforms have different gating kinetics and
varying sensitivities to block by tetrodotoxin (ttx). thus,  xxxg2020xxx ,
 xxxg2029xxx  and  xxxg2030xxx  are rapidly-inactivating ttx-sensitive (ttx-s)
na+ channels, whereas nav 1.8 and  xxxg2019xxx  are slowly-inactivating
ttx-resistant (ttx-r) channels.3-6
in nociceptive neurons, varying levels of expression of  xxxg2030xxx ,
 xxxg2018xxx ,  xxxg2019xxx , and the brain sodium channels  xxxg2020xxx ,  xxxg2022xxx ,
 xxxg2024xxx  contribute to electrical excitability.7 changes in the expression levels of these na+ channels have been implicated in the
alterations of neuronal excitability associated with acute and chronic
pain syndromes.8-11 neuropathic pain has multiple etiologies and
develops in many disease states, including diabetic mellitus, alcoholism, entrapment syndromes, herpes and hiv infections, and
after lesions of the brain, spinal and peripheral nervous tissues.
loss-of-function as well as gain-of-function congenital mutations
of na+ channel alpha-subunits have been identified in patients with
epilepsy, seizures, ataxia and increased/decreased sensitivity to
pain. the alpha polypeptide (pore-forming unit) of the  xxxg2030xxx 
na+ channel encoded by the gene  xxxg2030xxx  is a rapidly-inactivating
ttx-s na+ channel that is highly expressed in spinal dorsal root
ganglion (drg) neurons.12,13 goldberg and colleagues14 showed
that humans lacking functional  xxxg2030xxx  channels exhibit a complete
insensitivity to pain with apparently no other deficits, suggesting that
the loss of  xxxg2030xxx  activity may selectively reduce pain. furthermore,
cummins and colleagues15 have shown that gain-of-function mutations in  xxxg2030xxx  cause inherited painful neuropathies, indicating
a central role for  xxxg2030xxx  in nociception. the alpha polypeptide
(pore-forming unit) of the nav 1.8 na+ channel encoded by the gene
 xxxg2018xxx  is a slowly-inactivating ttx-r na+ channel that is found
in drg neurons and small nociceptive c-type pain fibers.16,17 using
a nociceptor-specific  xxxg2018xxx  knockout mouse model, matthews and
colleagues18 showed significant reduction in spontaneous firing as

well as reduced responses of spinal wide dynamic range neurons to
mechanical stimulation. furthermore, following peripheral nerve
damage, protein expression of  xxxg2018xxx  channels is reduced in injured
neurons; however, the expression level of  xxxg2018xxx  is increased in
uninjured neurons. activity in the uninjured neurons has been
shown to be critical in neuropathic pain states.19 recently, selective
block of  xxxg2018xxx  has also been shown to alleviate both inflammatory
and neuropathic pain in animals.20
nonselective inhibitors of na+ channels, such as lidocaine and
mexiletine, have been shown to attenuate hyperalgesia in animal
models of neuropathic pain and in humans.21,22 however the therapeutic application of these agents is limited due to their side-effects.
consequently, there is a great need for new drugs to treat pain.
 xxxd3083xxx  has been shown to reduce the cardiac  xxxg2028xxx  persistent
(late) ina23 the drug has been approved for reduction of chronic
angina and shown to be safe.24  xxxd3083xxx  (a structural analog of
lidocaine, fig. 1) block of late ina was significantly reduced after
mutation of an amino acid residue in the putative local anesthetic
binding site of the sodium channel,25,26 suggesting that its site and
mechanism of action may be similar to those of lidocaine, a known
blocker of both  xxxg2030xxx  and  xxxg2018xxx . further,  xxxd3083xxx  was reported
to block the open state of  xxxg2030xxx  ina in a use-dependent manner.25
in this study, we investigated the open as well as the inactivated state
block of  xxxg2030xxx  by  xxxd3083xxx . because evidence from several studies
suggests that  xxxg2018xxx  also has a critical role in peripheral pain sensing,
the effects of  xxxd3083xxx  on  xxxg2018xxx  were also determined. thus, we
performed voltage-clamp experiments on human embryonic kidney
(hek293) cells transfected with human  xxxg2030xxx  (hnav1.7 +  xxxg836xxx 
subunit) and on the drg-derived cell line nd7-23 expressing rat
 xxxg2018xxx  (rnav1.8) na+ channels to investigate whether  xxxd3083xxx 
blocks these two neuropathic pain na+ channel targets at concentrations of the drug that are achieved therapeutically (i.e., 2–8 mum)
during treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease.

characterization of na+ channels in untransfected and transfected nd7-23 and transfected hek293 cells. figure 1 shows the
effect of 300 nm ttx on hek293 cells stably expressing hnav1.7
+  xxxg836xxx  subunits (fig. 2a) and untransfected nd7-23 cells (fig. 2b)
or nd7-23 cells stably expressing rnav1.8 na+ channels (nd7-23/
rnav1.8; fig. 2c). ttx (300 nm) completely blocked the hnav1.7
ina in hek293 and endogenous ina in nd7-23 cells. in contrast,
300 nm ttx caused a minimal block of rnav1.8 ina, confirming
previous reports of the resistance of rnav1.8 to the toxin.6
 xxxd3083xxx  blocks recombinant human and native rat na1.7
and  xxxg2018xxx  currents. the application of 30 mum  xxxd3083xxx  to either
hek293 cells stably expressing hnav1.7 or nd7-23/rnav1.8 na+
channels produced a significant reduction of peak current (fig. 3a)
and suggested a considerable acceleration of the rate of inactivation (transition from open to inactivated states). to quantify the
changes in ina decay rates (in the absence and presence of 30 mum
 xxxd3083xxx ) the current traces (hnav1.7 and rnav1.8) were fit with
single exponentials. at -20 mv the decay of hnav1.7 currents for
control conditions and in the presence of 30 mum  xxxd3083xxx  had time
constants of 1.51 ± 0.31 and 0.68 ± 0.15 msec (n = 4 cells, p < 0.05),
respectively. similarly, at +20 mv the decay of rnav1.8 currents for
control conditions and in the presence of 30 mum  xxxd3083xxx  had

50-msec test pulse to -20 (hnav1.7 or untransfected nd7-23 cells) or +20
(rnav1.8) mv at intervals of 10 sec. addition of 300 nm ttx completely
blocked the hnav1.7 ina. however, 300 nm ttx caused minimal block of
rnav1.8 ina, demonstrating and confirming the reported resistance of this
channel isoform to ttx.

 xxxd3083xxx  caused a concentration-dependent block of hnav1.7
and rnav1.8 at holding potentials of -120 or -100 mv, respectively
(fig. 3b). when the holding potential in experiments was set at
a voltage close to the midpoint of the voltage-dependent steadystate inactivation relationship (voltage at which 50% of channels
are inactivated) for each channel (-70 mv for  xxxg2030xxx  and -40 mv
for  xxxg2018xxx ), the concentration-response relationship for  xxxd3083xxx 
block of ina was shifted to the left (i.e., to lower  xxxd3083xxx  concentrations) (fig. 3b).  xxxd3083xxx  also blocked the endogenous ttx-s

holding potential (-120 or -100 mv) before a 50-msec depolarizing step to

calculated (see methods for details) and the voltage-dependence of
gna was plotted in the absence (■, hnav1.7; ●, rnav1.8, fig. 4c)
and presence (□, hnav1.7; ○, rnav1.8, fig. 4c) of 10 mum  xxxd3083xxx . the values of mean half-maximal voltage (v½) for activation
and the slope (k) factors of the relationships in the absence (control)
and presence of  xxxd3083xxx  are shown in table 2.  xxxd3083xxx  did not
significantly shift the voltage range across which channel activation
occurred (fig.4, table 2, activation). figure 4d shows the decay of

effect to decrease on the time constants of current decay at voltages
between -40 to +5 mv for hnav1.7 and -35 to +30 mv for rnav1.8,
respectively.

10 mum  xxxd3083xxx  (□, hnav1.7; ○, rnav1.8).  xxxd3083xxx  caused
a significant (p < 0.05) leftward shift in the v½ of fast-inactivation
without affecting the slope (k) factor of hnav1.7, and a minimal (p
= 0.15) leftward shift in the v½ of fast-inactivation without affecting
the slope (k) factor of rnav1.8 ina (see fig. legends for values).

the pulse protocol shown in figure 5c was employed for
both hnav1.7 and rnav1.8. using this protocol, slow
inactivation (physiological) became evident at potential of -80 mv and -75 mv for hnav1.7 and rnav1.8,
respectively. however, slow-inactivation was only 50 and
70% complete at the maximum conditioning test pulse
of -10 mv. figure 5c shows voltage-clamp protocols and

(see fig. legends for values).
the  xxxd3083xxx -induced shift in the mid-point (v½)

hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 (fig. 3, table 1, at v½ holding

interacting with the inactivated states of these channels.
to estimate the extent of block of inactivated channels by  xxxd3083xxx , an indirect approach based on the
concentration-dependence of the shift of the steady-state
inactivation curve28 was used ( xxxg1274xxx  and kdi values, calculated as described in methods). estimates of dissociation
constants for  xxxd3083xxx  to bind to rested ( xxxg1274xxx ) and inactivated (kdi) states of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 channels were
found to be 12.12 and 22.84 mum and 0.47 and 0.64 mum,

state of these na+ channels. however, it is unclear whether block
of hnav1.7 or rnav1.8 na+ channels by  xxxd3083xxx  with 10-msec
depolarizing pulses at 1, 5 and 10 hz also involved the transient
open state in addition to the inactivated state of the channel. wang
and colleagues25 have demonstrated that both muscle  xxxg2026xxx  and
neuronal  xxxg2030xxx  are equally sensitive to  xxxd3083xxx  block, and they
also demonstrated that the drug preferentially blocks the open state
of these na+ channels. to investigate block of the open state of
 xxxg2030xxx  and  xxxg2018xxx  channels, the effect of pulse duration on magnitude of use-dependent block by  xxxd3083xxx  was investigated. figure
6 shows representative records of rnav1.8 current elicited by 5 (fig.
8a) or 200 msec (fig. 8b) long test pulses to +50 mv at a frequency
of 5 hz in the presence of 100 mum  xxxd3083xxx . peak current elicited
by each pulse was measured, normalized to the current of the first
pulse, and plotted against the pulse number in figure 8c. the plot
shows that the development of use-dependent block of rnav1.8 ina
evoked by 3 (▽), 5 (△), 20 (○) or 200 (□) msec-long test pulses to
+50 mv in the presence of 100 mum  xxxd3083xxx  reached a steady-state
of 71.69 ± 0.85% (n = 4–5 cells, each) with a time constant of 2.34
± 0.22 pulses. in the absence of drug, repetitive pulses caused small
reductions in ina amplitude that increased with an increase of pulse
duration from 16.89 ± 4.59% at 3 msec (n = 5 cells) to 24.61 ±
3.34% (5 msec, n = 4 cells), 27.15 ± 3.18% at 20 msec (n = 4 cells)

and 30.43 ± 2.55% at 200 msec (n = 4 cells, data not shown). the
development of use-dependent block of hnav1.7 ina evoked by 2, 5,
20 or 200 msec-long test pulses to -20 mv was also determined. in
the presence of 100 mum  xxxd3083xxx , use-dependent block of hnav1.7
reached a steady-state of 80.92 ± 1.53% (n = 5–6 cells, each) with a
time constant of 5.83 ± 0.19 pulses. in the absence of drug, repetitive
stimulation caused small or no reductions in the amplitude of ina
(data not shown). thus, our data show that  xxxd3083xxx  blocked open
states of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 ina.

discussion
in this study we show that  xxxd3083xxx  blocked  xxxg2030xxx  and
 xxxg2018xxx  ina at clinically relevant (2–8 mum) concentrations. these
channels are present in peripheral pain-sensing neurons and are
reported to play an important role in the etiology of neuropathic
pain.  xxxd3083xxx  inhibited hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 na+ channels in a
voltage- and use-dependent manner.  xxxd3083xxx  did not alter the activation voltage range of either  xxxg2030xxx  or  xxxg2018xxx  ina, or the voltage at
which half-maximal activation (v½) of current occurred. however,
 xxxd3083xxx  caused a concentration-dependent hyperpolarizing shift
of the inactivation voltages of both currents. these data suggest that
the binding of  xxxd3083xxx  was state-dependent. this interpretation
was further confirmed by the finding that the potency of the drug

was greater at more positive membrane potentials. interestingly, the
effects of  xxxd3083xxx  to reduce ina were identical (~80% ina inhibition) when different conditioning pulse durations (3, 5, 20 and 200
msec) were employed (fig. 8), suggesting that the drug could rapidly
bind to open na+ channels. recently, wang and colleagues25 have
­demonstrated that the muscle and neuronal na+ channels,  xxxg2026xxx 
and  xxxg2030xxx , respectively, are equally sensitive to  xxxd3083xxx  block.
these investigators reported that the drug preferentially interacts
with the open, but not resting or inactivated states, of na+ channels.
our results (fig. 8) also indicate that  xxxd3083xxx  interacted with the
open states. but importantly,  xxxd3083xxx  also accelerated the onset of
inactivation (fig. 6) and delayed recovery of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8
na+ channels from slow inactivation (fig. 6), suggesting that it interacts with inactivated states of these channels.
block of voltage-gated na+ channels by local anesthetics is highly
state-dependent with a preference for open and inactivated channel
states. the effect of  xxxd3083xxx  on the voltage dependence of steadystate inactivation of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 was dependent on the
length of the depolarizing prepulse that was used to inactivate the
channel (fig. 5). using 100-msec prepulses, 10 mum  xxxd3083xxx 
caused ~11 mv (11.41 ± 4.27 mv; p < 0.05) shift in the voltage
dependence of steady-state fast inactivation of hnav1.7, but caused
~7 mv (7.54 ± 4.04 mv; p = 0.15) shift of rnav1.8. interestingly,
when the depolarizing prepulse was increased to 1 sec (fig. 5b, table
2), even 3 mum  xxxd3083xxx  caused ~10 and 20 mv shifts in the voltage
dependence of steady-state intermediate inactivation of hnav1.7
and rnav1.8 channels, respectively. similarly, with a 10 sec depolarizing prepulse,  xxxd3083xxx  (10 mum) caused ~24 and 17 mv shifts of
the voltage dependence of steady-state slow inactivation hnav1.7
and rnav1.8, respectively. further, it was demonstrated previously
that the binding affinity of drug to inactivated channels could be
estimated indirectly using the concentration-dependent shift in the
steady-state inactivation curve (deltav½ shift in midpoint of the steadystate inactivation curve).28 the kdi (dissociation constant for block
of inactivated channels) values of 0.47 and 0.64 mum calculated for
 xxxd3083xxx  inhibitions of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 were lower than the
ic50 values of 3.25 and 4.33 mum measured using a protocol with
conditioning prepulses to -70 and -40 mv, respectively. the differences of these kdi and ic50 values for block of hnav1.7 and rna1.8
by  xxxd3083xxx  might be due to overestimation of drug affinity by
the equation (model). nevertheless, either set of estimates suggests
that  xxxd3083xxx  inhibits  xxxg2030xxx  and  xxxg2018xxx  at concentrations that
are achieved clinically during administration of the drug. our data
suggest that  xxxd3083xxx  could be interacting with fast, intermediate
and slow inactivated states of hnav1.7 and intermediate and slow
inactivated states of rnav1.8. the effects of  xxxd3083xxx  are similar
to the effect of lidocaine and  xxxd2436xxx  on hnav1.7 (stable expression in hek293 cells), rnav1.8 (recorded from drg neurons) and
na+ currents recorded from neocortical neurons and mouse neuroblastoma cells.33,34 furthermore, the state-dependence of block of
hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 na+ channels by  xxxd3083xxx  could be desirable
and lead to a greater effect of the drug when neuronal firing frequencies are increased, as during prolonged neuronal depolarization.35
slow inactivation in ttx-r na+ channels has been suggested to
play a central role in controlling adaptation of action potential firing
in nociceptive sensory neurons.36 in the absence of drug, repetitive
stimulation (at rates up to 10 hz) of hnav1.7 and ttx-s ina endog456

currents evoked by the nth impulse (40th) was normalized to that of the current
evoked by the first pulse and plotted versus respective pulse number.

enously expressed in nd7-23 cells caused minimal reduction in
current amplitude (~9%, fig. 7). in contrast, repetitive stimulation
of rnav1.8 at rates of 1, 5 and 10 hz caused ~21%, ~35 and 42%
reductions in current amplitude, respectively, in the absence of drug
(fig. 7). this reduction could be due to entry of rnav1.8 na+ channels into inactivated states during a brief depolarization (10 msec).
vijayaragavan and colleagues29 reported that the time course of
 xxxg2018xxx  entry into a slow inactivated state (tauf = 8.4 msec) was faster
than that of  xxxg2030xxx  (tauf = 33 msec). similarly, our results (fig. 6 and

table 3) further indicate that the onset of slow inactivation is fourfold faster for  xxxg2018xxx  than  xxxg2030xxx  channels (tauf = 10.78 and 43.97
msec for  xxxg2018xxx  and  xxxg2030xxx  channels, respectively). thus, during
the brief 10-msec depolarization used in the repetitive stimulating
protocol, a significant fraction of rnav1.8, but not hnav1.7, may
undergo slow inactivation. drug-induced use-dependent block arises
from binding of drug to, and stabilization of, inactivated states of
channels (which increase as the frequency of stimulation increases)
and/or from dissociation of drugs from inactivated states with a
time constant slower than the frequency of the pulses (i.e., a slow
repriming rate).  xxxd3083xxx  (30 mum) caused a use-dependent block
of hnav1.7, rnav1.8 or ttx-s na+ channels (fig. 7). also,  xxxd3083xxx  (30 mum) caused a significant delay in recovery (at both -80
and -100 mv) from slow inactivation (taus) of hnav1.7 and rnav1.8
na+ channels. this finding suggests that the use-dependent block by
 xxxd3083xxx  of ttx-s and ttx-r ina reflects the binding of  xxxd3083xxx  to inactivated states of na+ channels. however, further studies
using site-directed mutagenesis are needed to better understand the
inactivated state interactions of  xxxd3083xxx  to rnav1.8 na+ channels.
most na+ channels are multimeric proteins in which the poreforming alpha-subunit is associated with accessory beta subunits.37 in
this study, hnav1.7 was co-expressed with a human  xxxg836xxx  subunit.
vijayaragavan and colleagues29 showed that co-expression of hnav1.7
with a  xxxg836xxx  subunit in xenopus oocytes caused a hyperpolarizing shift
in gating and an increase in rates of inactivation and recovery from
inactivation. the nd7-23 cells used in this study endogenously
express  xxxg836xxx  and  xxxg838xxx  subunits.27 the overexpression of rnav1.8 in this
cell line may lead to formation of membrane na+ channels composed
of pore-forming alpha-subunits with or without attendant beta subunits.
thus, direct extrapolation of effects of  xxxd3083xxx  on na+ channels
expressed in the heterologous cell models used in this study to cells
expressing native na+ channels should be done with caution.
local anesthetics (lidocaine, mexiletine,  xxxd3387xxx ) have been
reported to be useful in therapy of painful diabetic polyneuropathies,
neuralgic pain and traumatic peripheral nerve injuries.38 lidocaine
has been shown to inhibit the inactivated state of ttx-r ina with
an ic50 value of 59.5 mum. in addition, lidocaine has been shown
to suppress the number of ttx-r action potentials during repetitive firing and block of ttx-r na+ channels by local anesthetics

their pain suppression.39 furthermore, lidocaine has been shown to
relieve neuropathic pain at serum concentrations as low as 10 mum
(2.4 mug/ml).40  xxxd3083xxx  (structurally related to lidocaine), a newly
approved anti-ischemic agent, has been shown to inhibit cardiac
late ina,41 and may also have anti-arrhythmic properties.24,42 in the
present study,  xxxd3083xxx  blocked hnav1.7 and rnav1.8 na+ channels with ic50 values of 3.25 and 4.33 mum, concentrations that are
achieved therapeutically (2 to 8 mum). our finding that  xxxd3083xxx 
binds to inactivated states of  xxxg2030xxx  and  xxxg2018xxx  channels with
high affinity suggests that the drug may reduce firing frequencies of
neurons that express these channels. thus, investigation of the effects
of  xxxd3083xxx  on neuronal function, and on models of neuropathic
pain, is warranted.

materials and methods
expression of sodium channels. hek293 cells stably expressing
the hnav1.7 (alpha-subunit) along with a human  xxxg836xxx  subunit were
purchased from scottish-biomedical, glasgow, uk. cells were
continuously maintained using mem (gibco-invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1%
penicillin-streptomycin, 600 mug/ml  xxxd2191xxx  (gibco-invitrogen),
2 mug/ml blastocydin (calbiochem, nj, usa), and were incubated
at 37°c in an atmosphere of 5% co2 in air.
the cell line nd7-23 (rat drg/mouse neuroblastoma hybrid,
untransfected) was purchased from european collection of animal
cell cultures (porton down, uk). recombinant nd7-23/rnav1.8
cells were purchased from millipore (uk) limited, cambridge,
uk. it has been reported that nd7-23 cells also express a ttx-s
ina that has rapid kinetics, but the molecular identity of these na+
channels is still not clear.27 cells were maintained using dmem
(gibco-invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
1% l-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, 400 mug/ml  xxxd2191xxx  (gibco-invitrogen), and were
incubated at 37°c in an atmosphere of 5% co2 in air.

cells or rnav1.8 ina, cells were superfused with an ­extracellular solution containing (in mm): 140 nacl, 5 hepes-na, 1.3 mgcl2, 1
cacl2, 11 glucose, 4.7 kcl, ph 7.4. patch pipettes were filled with
an internal solution containing (in mm): 120 csf, 10 hepes, 10
egta, 15 nacl, ph 7.25. to determine the use-dependence of drug
block of rnav1.8, experiments were performed using a test potential
of +50 mv (at which the na+ current is outward) and an extracellular solution containing (in mm): 65 nacl, 85 choline cl, 2 cacl2,
10 hepes, ph 7.4 (with  xxxd3337xxx  hydroxide). patch
pipettes were filled an internal solution containing (in mm): 100 naf,
30 nacl, 10 egta, 10 hepes, ph 7.2 (with csoh). the reversed
na+ gradient was employed to minimize series resistance artifacts,
which are less serious with outward than with inward ina flow. unless
otherwise mentioned, patch-clamp studies using nd7-23 cells were
performed in the continuous presence of 300 nm ttx to block the
endogenous ttx-s ina.6 research grade  xxxd3083xxx  was synthesized
by the department of bio-organic chemistry at cv therapeutics,
inc., (palo alto, ca) and ttx was purchased from sigma (st. louis,
mo).  xxxd3083xxx  was dissolved in 0.1 n hcl to give a stock solution
of 10 mm and further dilutions were freshly made in tyrode solution
on the day of the experiments. ttx was dissolved in distilled water.
electrophysiological technique and data acquisition. whole-cell
ina was recorded as described previously43 using an axopatch 200b
amplifier (molecular devices, sunnyvale, usa). signals were filtered
at 5 khz and sampled at 20 khz. patch pipettes were formed from
borosilicate glass (world precision instruments, sarasota, usa) using
a micropipette puller (dagan corporation, minneapolis, usa). the
offset potential was zeroed before the pipette was attached to the cell
and the voltages were not corrected for the liquid junction potential.
in all recordings, 75–80% of the series resistance compensation was
achieved, thus yielding a maximum voltage error of ~5 mv and leak
currents were cancelled by p/-4 subtraction. pclamp 10.0 software
(molecular devices) was used to generate voltage clamp protocols
and acquire data. cells were held at a membrane potential of -100
or -120 mv and were dialyzed with pipette solution for 5–7 minutes
before current was recorded, to avoid time-dependent shifts in na+
channel gating within the first several minutes after patch rupture. in
all experiments, the temperature of experimental solutions was maintained at 20 ± 1°c using a cl-100 bipolar temperature controller
(warner instruments, hamden, usa).
data were analyzed using clampfit and microcal origin
(microcal, northampton, usa) software. results are expressed as
mean ± s.e.m, and n refers to number of cells. all experiments
were repeated on at least two different experimental days. statistical
significance of differences between responses of a cell in the absence
and presence of drug was determined using the student t-test, with
p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. concentration-response
relations were fit using the hill equation:

gna = ina/(v - vrev)
where v is the test pulse potential and vrev is the calculated reversal
potential. normalized na+ conductance was plotted against test
pulse potential and fit to a boltzmann equation:
g/gmax = 1/[1 + exp((v½ - v)/k)]
where g is the measured conductance, gmax is the maximal conductance, v½ is the membrane potential at which the half-maximal
channel open probability occurs and k is the slope of the curve. for
assessing the voltage dependence of steady-state fast and intermediate
inactivation, prepulses ranging from -120 to 0 mv (for hnav1.7 ina)
or -100 to +20 mv (for rnav1.8 ina) were applied for a period of 100
msec (to measure fast inactivation), or 1 sec (to measure intermediate
inactivation), followed by a 50-msec depolarizing step to 0 mv (for
hnav1.7 ina) or to +20 mv (rnav1.8 ina). the peak current (i) was
normalized relative to the maximal value (imax) obtained at a holding
potential (vh) of -100 or -120 mv and plotted against the conditioning pulse potential. data were fit to a boltzmann equation:
i/imax = 1/[1 + exp((v - v½)/k)]
where v is the membrane potential during the pre-pulse, v½ the
potential at which the half-maximal channel inactivation occurs and
k is the slope factor. for assessing the voltage dependence of steadystate slow inactivation, prepulses ranging from -120 to -10 mv (for
hnav1.7 ina) or -100 to -10 mv (for rnav1.8 ina) were applied for
a period of 10 msec, followed by a 100-msec hyperpolarizing step to
-160 (for hnav1.7) or -140 mv (for rnav1.8) and then stepped to 0
(for hnav1.7 ina) or +20 mv (rnav1.8 ina) for a period of 50-msec
to measure the available current. the brief 100-msec hyperpolarizing
step was employed to allow channels (both without and with drug
bound) to recovery from fast, but not slow-inactivation. data from
the voltage dependence of steady-state slow inactivation were fit with
a modified boltzmann equation:44,45
i/imax = (1 - iresid)/[1 + exp(-(v - v½)/k)]
where iresid is the residual (noninactivating) fraction of the current.
to estimate the extent of block of inactivated channels by  xxxd3083xxx , an indirect approach based on the concentration-dependence
of the shift of the steady-state inactivation curve was used (reviewed
in ref. 28, see equation below).
deltav½ = k log[(1 + [ xxxd3083xxx ]/ xxxg1274xxx )/(1 + [ xxxd3083xxx ]/kdi)]

idrug/icontrol = 1/[1 + (d/ic50)nh]
where idrug/icontrol is fractional block, d is drug concentration, ic50
is the drug concentration that causes 50% block and nh is the hill
coefficient. the voltage dependence of activation was determined
using 50-msec depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -120
or -100 mv to test potentials ranging from -80 to +40 mv, in 5 mv
increments. to determine the voltage dependence of channel activa458

tion, na+ conductance (gna) was calculated from the peak current
(ina), using the equation:

where deltav½ is the shift in midpoint of the steady-state (intermediate)
inactivation curve, k is the slope factor of the steady-state (intermediate) inactivation curve derived from a boltzmann fit,  xxxg1274xxx  is the
affinity constant for the resting state of the channel and kdi is the
affinity constant for the inactivated state of the channel.
the time course of entry into the slow inactivated state was
measured using a three pulse protocol of incremental time delay (0.1

to 10 sec) to -40 or -20 mv (hnav1.7) or -20 or +20 mv (rnav1.8)
to allow development of block (i0). a 20-msec hyperpolarizing
step to -100 mv was inserted to allow recovery of unbound channels (from inactivation), followed by a standard test pulse to assess
channel availability. the test current was normalized and plotted
against the conditioning pulse interval and fit to a double or triple
exponential function,
i/i0 = af · (1 - exp(-t/tauf)) + as · (1 - exp(-t/taus))
where t = conditioning pulse duration, tauf and taus = fast and slow
time constants, af and as = relative amplitude of the fast and slow
recovery component, or

where t = conditioning pulse duration, tauf, taui and taus = fast, intermediate and slow time constants, and af, ai and as = relative amplitude
of the fast and slow recovery component.
recovery from inactivation was measured with a standard twopulse protocol of 50-msec duration with an incremental time delay
of 1 msec to 8 sec between the two pulses at a repolarizing potential
of -80 or -100 mv (holding potential = -100 mv; test potential =
-20 mv (hnav1.7 ina) or +20 mv (rnav1.8 ina)). the peak current
elicited by the second pulse (i) was normalized relative to the current
elicited by the first pulse (i0). the duration of every cycle of the
double pulse protocol was 20 sec. i/i0 was plotted against the time
delay between the two pulses and fit to a double or triple exponential
function,
i/i0 = af · (1 - exp(-t/tauf)) + as · (1 - exp(-t/taus))
where t = recovery time interval, tauf and taus = fast and slow time
constants, and af and as = relative amplitude of the fast and slow

the fast and slow recovery component.
