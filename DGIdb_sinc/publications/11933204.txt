human mu-opioid receptor ( xxxg1635xxx ) is the major site for the analgesic action of most
opioid drugs such as morphine, methadone and heroin. it was previously reported that a
single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) in exon1 (c.118a→g) of  xxxg1635xxx  might modestly
alter the affinity in  xxxg1801xxx -mu interaction. using denaturing high performance
liquid chromatography (dhplc) the complete coding region of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene was
screened for snps in han-chinese heroin addicts and normal control. three novel snps
were detected, one in exon3, one in intron3 and one in the 3’ untranslated region. the snp
c.118a→g reportedly altered the interaction of  xxxg1635xxx  with opioid had no statistically
significant correlation with heroin addition in han chinese. however, addicted subjects with
the snp in intron2 (ivs2 +31g→a) tended to show much higher heroin intake dosages than
those without this snp. we also observed that individuals carrying both snp c.118a→g and
ivs2 +31g→a consumed relatively more drugs compared to other addicts. thus our study
further highlights the importance of studing the various regions of the  xxxg1635xxx 
gene, coding as well as non-coding, for genetic markers that may be linked to, or directly
contribute to opioid drug-seeking behavior. © 2002 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction

mu-opioid receptor gene ( xxxg1635xxx ; mim# 600018; genbank  xxxg1635xxx ) is an important component of the
self-rewarding system, interacting with multiple endogenous opioid peptides including  xxxg1801xxx  (selly et al.,
1992), and endomorphins (zadina et al., 1997). it also mediates the effects of several important opioid analgesic
agents and drugs such as morphine, methadone, fentanyl (basbaum et al., 1984; pasternak, 1993), and especially
received 22 october 2001; revised manuscript accepted 15 january 2002.

heroin (kreek, 1996). rapid activation of the  xxxg1635xxx  by heroin and/or its analogs results in an euphoric
effect that may have conferred reinforcing or rewarding effects of the drug, and thus contributed to the
development of drug addiction (koob, 1992; wise, 1996).
allelic variants at the  xxxg1635xxx  locus have been identified in both mouse and human (uhl et al., 1999; bond et
al., 1998; hoehe et al., 2000). in mouse, snps in  xxxg1635xxx  significantly contributed to the differences in the
modulation by opiates (uhl et al., 1999). in human, the c.118a→g snp in exon1 transition that caused an
asn40asp substitution in the  xxxg1635xxx  led to increased affinity of the receptor to its endogenous ligand, opioid
peptide  xxxg1801xxx , in vitro (bond et al., 1998). it was suggested that genetic variation in  xxxg1635xxx  gene might
affect human addiction to opioid (uhl et al., 1999).
we examined the genomic diversity of  xxxg1635xxx  gene with regards to the susceptibility to heroin addiction using
denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc), which identifies snps based on the variation in
melting temperature (kuklin et al., 1997-98). five snps including three novel and two previously reported
(c.118a→g and ivs2+31g→a) were detected. the c.118a→g transition does not independently affect the heroin
addiction, although it changed the affinity of  xxxg1635xxx  to  xxxg1801xxx  in vitro (bond et al., 1998). our results
showed, however, the carriers of ivs2 +31g→a in intron 2 had higher level of addiction to heroin.
materials and methods
study subjects

this study was approved by an institutional review board of the chinese academy of sciences. blood samples
from heroin addicts and normal control were included in this study. all addictive subjects were former heroindependent addicts without other drug abuse. addicts were then undergoing methadone maintenance treatment in
nanjing drug abuse control bureau. detailed information including health conditions, heroin-intake routes, drug
abuse history and daily intake dose was obtained when the abusers entered the methadone maintenance treatment.
the drug dosage, on which the initial dose of methadone was based, was questioned before the methadone
treatment. soon after the beginning of treatment, drug dosage was questioned again in regard to the patients'
response to methadone. only subjects with consistent report on abuse history (median: 12 months, interquartile:
4.5-22 months) and effective dose of methadone concurred with empirical dose were included in this study. the
daily intake dose ranged from 0.1g/day to 3g/day, and the median was 0.4 g/day and interquartile range was 0.20.8g/day. participants recruited by advertisement were used as normal control and confirmed to be without drug or
alcohol abuse history by a questionnaire. control samples were selected so that the age (minimum=15,
maximum=44, average=27.3±5.7) and sex (male:female=1:0.7) distributions were similar to that of the addicts. all
subjects studied were han chinese. detailed information is available at www.cell.ac.cn/sample-info.htm.
amplification of samples

genomic dna was prepared from peripheral blood samples with standard phenol extraction protocol. primers
were designed to amplify the four coding exons of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene. exon3 was amplified in two overlapping
pieces to optimize the separation of mutants from wild-type sequences in dhplc. a typical amplification was
performed in a 25µl reaction volume, containing 50ng of genomic dna, 0.2µm of each primers, 100µm
dntps, 20mm tris-cl (ph8.8), 10mm kcl, 1.0-1.5mm mgcl2 and 2.5u pfu polymerase (stratagene, la
jolla, ca) for 35 cycles at 94oc for 45 second, 63oc for 1 minute, and 72oc for 2 minutes in geneamp® pcr
system 9700 (pe applied biosystem). primer sequences for exon1 were f1:  xxxg873xxx , ctt, gga, acc, cga, aaa,
gtc; r1: cat, tga, gcc, ttg, gga, gtt, a.; for exon2, f2: tgc, aaa, ttt, att, att, gga, agc; r2:
caa, cat, atc, agg, ctg, tga, acc; for exon3, f3-1: atg, ttg, ctg, cta, att, ttt, cc; r3-1: cgt,
aaa, tgt, gaa, tgg, gac, tc; f3-2: tgg, ctc, caa, aga, aaa, gga; r3-2: tgt, cat, ccc, cag,
tag, ata, tac, c; for exon4, f4: gaa, aaa, ctg, agg, ctt, gca, ggt, g; r4: cac, att, ctt, gaa,
gca, acc, tgc, tt.
dhplc analysis and sequence determination

dhplc was carried out on an automated hplc instrument equipped with a dna separation column
(transgenomic, san jose, ca). for exons 1, 2, 3 (2 fragments) and 4, the temperature of the dhplc column were
65oc, 58oc, 60oc, 60oc and 59oc, and the acetonitrile gradient was 56-63%, 56-67%, 53-59%, 56-63% and 5662%, respectively. pcr products displaying altered dhplc chromatograph were bidirectionally sequenced by big
dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (pe, foster city, ca). sequencing was performed on an
automated dna sequencer abi 377 (pe applied biosystem).

snps in  xxxg1635xxx  and heroin addiction 3

statistics method
to screen for all possible snps at  xxxg1635xxx , 96 samples (48 addicts and 48 control individuals) were first
analyzed. only those snps that were located in an exon or observed more than once were studied in an expanded
sample. for the rare sequence variations in frequencies lower than 1%, no effort was made to accurately determine
their frequencies. the expanded sample size was determined by given allowable sampling error width (95%
confidence interval of the population means). the snp sites were studied in different numbers of samples based on
the frequencies in order to assure the statistical significance. one hundred and forty-five cases and 48 controls
were analyzed in c.118a>g snp and 232 cases and 160 controls were analyzed in ivs2 +31g>a. in total 145
heroin addicts were analyzed in both c.118a>g and ivs2 +31g>a sites. hardy-weinberg equilibrium was
checked using the chi square test.
of the 193 individuals studied in allele c.118a→g, 145 were heroin addicts and for allele ivs2 +31g→a, 232
out of the 392 subjects were drug dependent (tables 1 and 2). assuming the genotype observed by hoehe et al.
(hoehe, 2000), our case-control sample had a power of 70% at snp ivs2 +31g→a (set statistical significance
level alpha=0.05). the frequency difference between addicts and control subjects was examined by chi square test.
the distribution of the drug dosage did not follow normal distribution; thus nonparametric ridit analysis was used
to examine the differences of addicts’ heroin intake dose among the genotypes (table 2). the interaction between
snps c.118 a→g and ivs2 +31g→a can not be tested by two-way anova because the daily intake dose was
not normally distributed. mann-whitney test was applied for the examination of the co-effect of both snps.
for analysis of linkage disequilibrium, arlequin was applied. linkage disequilibrium between c.118a→g and
ivs2 +31g→a were tested for genotypic data using a likelihood-ratio test, whose empirical distribution is
obtained by a permutation procedure (slatkin and excoffier, 1996).
results

we investigated the sequence diversity of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene using dhplc analysis. five snps in exon 1, exon
3, intron 2, intron 3, and 3'utr respectively, were observed (table 1). genotype frequencies of these snps were
in hardy-weinberg equilibrium, making selection bias less likely (chi-square test, p>0.05). three of them were
novel and submitted to hgbase. however, the c.17c→t in exon1 detected in a frequency of 1.9% in caucasian
population (bond et al., 1998) and other snps locating in  xxxg1635xxx  gene (hoehe et al., 2000) were not observed in
han chinese samples, presumably due to the different ethnic populations, low frequencies, or different region of
screening.

of the two snps, c.118a→g and ivs2 +31g→a, which presented frequencies higher than 1% in the
population studied, there was no significant difference in snp distribution between heroin addicts and the control
population (chi-square test, p>0.05). in addition, no significant difference was observed in length of heroin
addiction history (kruskal-wallis test, p>0.05), health conditions, age, and sex (chi-square test, p>0.05) among
the addicts with different  xxxg1635xxx  allele types. these results were consistent with the epidemiological data which
suggested that social factors such as education background, employment status and financial incoming level were
much more important in affecting the drug-administration than genetic factors (pang et al., 1999).
when the genotypes of the subjects were plotted against the daily drug intake dose, it was observed that the
addicts heterozygous at snp ivs2 +31g→a tended to have a higher daily intake dose of heroin compared to the
gg homozygotes (table 2, ridit test, p<0.05). however, no significant difference was observed among the addicts
with c.118aa, c.118ag, and c.118gg genotypes (ridit test, p>0.05).

on the other hand, our observation suggests that the c.118g→a snp may play a moderate role in opioid
physiology. median daily-heroin-intake in the six addicts who had both a heterozygous allele in snp ivs2
+31g→a and at least one “g” allele in c.118a→g (median: 1g/day, interquartile: 1-1.5g/day) was 2.5-fold higher
than the average (median: 0.4g/day, interquartile: 0.2-0.8g/day) (table 3). compared to the 139 addicts with other
genotypes, which were analyzed both in c.118a→g and ivs2 +31g→a, individuals with c.118 ag/gg and ivs2
+31 gg showed relatively high daily dose intake (mann-whitney test, p=0.001). however, no linkage
disequilibrium between these two snps was observed by arlequin (p>0.05).

discussion

the snp frequencies we detected on the  xxxg1635xxx  gene were not identical to that previously reported berrettini
et al.,1997; bond et al., 1998; bergen et al., 1997; hoehe et al., 2000), presumably due to the different ethnic
populations involved in our study. for example, we didn’t find the c.17c→t snp in our tested population,
although the frequency of the snp was once reported 10% in healthy caucasian and african-american volunteers
and 22% in cocaine/opioid addicts (berrettini et al., 1997). consistent with this observation, the frequency of the
c.17c→t snp varied significantly in other case reports of different populations (bond et al., 1998; bergen et al.,
1997).
no significant difference was observed between addicts with c.118aa and c.118ag/gg genotypes, suggesting
that the snp alone did not affect the heroin addiction although it altered the affinity between the  xxxg1635xxx  and
 xxxg1801xxx  in vitro (bond et al., 1998). gelernter and his colleagues studied the c.17c→t and c.118a→g
snps in exon1 in a number of populations, and did not observe any relationship between these two snps and
substance dependence status (gelernter et al., 1999). another report also indicated no significant association
between the particular genotype of  xxxg1635xxx  at this allele and heroin or alcohol dependence (franke et al., 2001).

snps in  xxxg1635xxx  and heroin addiction 5

our data was consistent with their results, suggesting that biological effect of the snp c.118a→g was rather
subtle, if any. on the other hand, the snp c.118g→a snp may play a moderate role in opioid physiology as
heroin addicts with genotypes of c.118ag/gg and ivs2 +31ga tend to have 2.5-fold higher daily heroin intake
than the median of all populations. it is possible that snps coordinately contribute to the drug addiction. more
samples with the particular genotypes should be examined to confirm the coordinate function of the two snps.
the snp ivs2 +31g→a, which was associated with drug consumption, was located in an intron. the
mechanism by which this snp contributed to heroin addiction has yet to be discovered. numerous snps in introns
of  xxxg1635xxx  gene associated with specific phenotypes were reported (hu et al., 1998; horikawa et al., 2000).
possible snp(s) genetically linked to the ivs2 +31g→a snp might change the regulation of the expression of
 xxxg1635xxx  gene. analyses of the  xxxg1635xxx  5' flanking sequence might help to find sequence variants related to the
functional changes (uhl et al., 1999). it was also possible that the influence of the snp ivs2 +31g→a on heroin
usage is more direct. for example, it may reside in an intron-based transcription enhancer or silencer, thus different
alleles may have different impacts on the transcription of  xxxg1635xxx  gene. the other possibility, suggested by
hoehe and colleagues (hoehe et al., 2000), maybe the disruption of (a/t)ggg repeat, which was known to be
able to regulate alternative splicing (sirand-pugnet et al., 1995).
although our data doesn't give support to the correlation between c.118a→g and heroin addiction, it favors the
idea that snps located in other regions may influence drug intake. because we only studied the exon region and
very short intron of  xxxg1635xxx , a genetic screening for snps in the promoter region of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene and the
measurement of the  xxxg1635xxx  expression level in patients with different genotypes should be proposed in the further
study of the role of genetic variations in the susceptibility of drug abuse.
