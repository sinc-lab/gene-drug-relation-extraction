summary
the presence of a  xxxg1601xxx  in human lymphocytes is well established, but factors affecting
its regulation have not been described. using a competitive binding whole cell assay. we have examined
the binding of c3h]-dexamethasone at 24 and 37’c in untreated normal subjects and in healthy subjects
taking various glucocorticoid preparations. at 24°c normal human lymphocytes had 6000 binding
sites/cell and a dissociation constant of 4 x 10e9 m. the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone.
5 mg of prednisone, and 37.5 mg of  xxxd1754xxx  resulted in a 30% decrease in binding sites after i
week with no change in binding affinity. no change in the number of binding sites was noted before 1
week and the diminished number persisted for 1 week after discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment.
lymphocytes from hospitalized patients taking 4@60 mg of dexamethasone daily demonstrated the
same change in number of binding sites that was seen in normal subjects taking 1 mg of dexamethasone.
when binding assays were carried out at physiologic temperature there was the same decrease in
number of binding sites after dexamethasone administration, and in addition, there was a two-fold
increase in binding affinity.
glucocorticoid administration results in a time-dependent decrease in the number of lymphocyte
glucocorticoid binding sites that is independent of the type of glucocorticoid administered. this is the
first in vim demonstration that glucocorticoids modulate their own receptors in man.

introduction

was incubated in plastic tissue culture flasks at 37 c
for 45 min to remove monocytes. after this procedure,
differential cell counts of wright’s stained smears
showed less than 2 monocytes or polymorphonuclear
leukocytes/100 nucleated cells, and less than 3’i;:of the
cells remaining after adherence ingested latex particles. the lymphocytes were washed with phosphate
buffered saline (pbs) ph 7.2, and resuspended in
mem at a density of 4 x lo6 cells/ml. five hundred
microliters of this suspension
were added to
12 x 75 ml glass tubes containing 50 microliters of
c3h]-dexamethasone and 50 microliters of unlabeled
dexamethasone. the final concentration of c3h]-dexamethasone was i nm and the final concentration of
unlabeled dexamethasone ranged from 0.5 to 50nm.
the unlabeled steroids were dissolved in ethanol and
the final ethanol concentration was always less than
0.01%. a io-fold
excess of unlabeled steroid was
used to determine the nonspecific binding. the tubes
were vortexed gently and incubated at 37 or 24’c for
6 and 8 h, respectively.
at the end of the incubation, 2ml of pbs at 4-c

unlike the cell surface receptors’for polypeptide hormones whose number and affinity vary with changes
in endogenous hormone concentrations [l-3], the
regulation of the  xxxg1601xxx  in man by
glucocorticoids themselves or by other hormones has
not been described. glucocorticoid
receptors are
present in many tissues including human white blood
cells. the binding characteristics of this receptor in
normal human lymphocytes have been determined [c7], and the ready availability of blood lymphocytes make this tissue ideal for examining the regulation of a steroid receptor.
using a whole cell competitive binding assay, we
have characterized the binding of [‘hi-dexamethasone to lymphocytes in normal subjects at 24 and
37c and have examined the effect of glucocorticoid
administration on the  xxxg1601xxx .
methods
binding assays were performed using a major
modification of the method of lippmanc4.51. fortyfive ml of peripheral blood obtained from normal
adult volunteers was heparinized and separated over
a  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque gradient [8]. the mononuclear cell
layer was removed and suspended in eagle’s minimal
essential medium (mem) supplemented with 600 mg/l
glutamine, 25 mm n-tris [hydroxymethyl]
methyl
glycine and 10% fetal calf serum. this cell suspension

was added to each tube and the tubes were centrifuged for 10min at 1ooog in a beckman centrifuge

(model 56). after washing with pbs twice, the cells
were suspended in 1 ml of 95% ethanol and 0.5 ml of
pbs and transferred to counting vials containing
lom1 of scintillation fluid. the cells were counted
after each wash and cell loss was less than 5%. radioactivity was counted for 10min in a packard tricarb

from computer assisted analysis of the binding data
according to the method of scatchardc91. the best fit

the mean of duplicate samples from multiple experiments. specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. the statistical analyses used included the two sample
student’s t-test and duncan’s multiple range test.
we purchased [l, 2(n)3h]-dexamethasone
(20 ci/
mmol) from amersham, arlington heights, illinois;
unlabeled dexamethasone, prednisone.  xxxd1754xxx , testosterone, 11 deoxycorticosterone, and  xxxd3253xxx

company, phillipsburg, new jersey.
after giving informed consent, healthy volunteers
took 1 or 3 mg dexamethasone, 37.5 mg cortisone
acetate, or 5 mg prednisone daily at 8 a.m. for 1 week.
all individuals were studied before and 1, 3 and 7
days after glucocorticoids were begun. binding parameters were also determined
1 week after
discontinuation of the steroid. blood samples were
drawn at 8 a.m., 24 h after the last dose of glucocorticoid was administered. we also studied hospitalized
patients taking 6-10 mg of dexamethasone every
4-6 h after neurosurgical procedures. these blood
samples were drawn 6 h after the last dose of dexamethasone.

was higher at 37°c (48% + 8) (sd) than at 24°c
(19% + 3). the ability of various steroids to compete
with [‘hi-dexamethasone
did not differ at the two
temperatures (fig. 3).
to demonstrate free exchange of the ligand with
binding sites, we incubated lymphocytes with 1 nm
[3h]-dexamethasone to steady state binding at 37”c,
diluted the cells logfold and then measured the rate
of dissociation. fifteen minutes after dilution, 50% of
the dexamethasone had dissociated, and by 30min
dissociation was complete. thus, the 45 min preincubation of the mononuclear cell preparation at 37°c
allowed adequate time for dissociation of endogenous
cortisol or administered dexamethasone from binding
sites.
we first examined the effect of glucocorticoid therapy on the glucocotticoid receptor at 24°c. lymphocytes from healthy subjects who took i mg of dexamethasone daily for 1 week had a 30% reduction in
binding sites with no change in binding affinity (fig. 5,

table 1). no change in the number of binding sites
was observed before 1 week, and the administration
of dexamethasone did not alter the ability of various
steroids to compete for c3h]-dexamethasone (fig. 3).
one week after discontinuation
of therapy, the
number of binding sites remained near 4000 sites/cell.
lymphocytes from hospitalized patients taking 40-60
mg of dexamethasone daily showed the same decrease
in binding sites that was seen in normal subjects taking i mg of dexamethasone (table 1). administration
of 37.5 mg  xxxd1754xxx  and 5 mg prednisone daily
for 1 week caused the same change in the number of
binding sites that was seen with dexamethasone
(table 1).
when we repeated the same studies at physiological
temperature, the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone for 1 week caused the same decrease in the
number of binding sites that was observed at 24°c. in
addition, there was a two-fold increase in binding affinity not seen at 24°c (fig. 6). no change in the
number of binding sites was observed after 3 days of

treatment, even when 3 mg of dexamethasone was
used, but an increase in binding affinity was noted as
early as 1 day after treatment. administration of  xxxd1754xxx  and prednisone caused the same decrease in receptor number to approximately 4000
sites/cell and an increase in binding affinity to
4.7 x lo-’ m and 5.3 x lo-’ m, respectively.

all studies of lymphocyte glucocorticoid binding
have been limited by the low specific binding characteristic of this system. in order to increase the assay
precision and to diminish the effect of large increases
in nonspecific binding, we performed the binding
assay with a single concentration of [3h]-dexamethasone and varying concentrations of unlabeled dexamethasone. we have represented all data as means of
duplicate samples from multiple experiments to minimize the error involved in measuring low specific
binding. all data were analyzed by two different statistical methods to confirm the changes in the number
of binding sites after hormone administration.
our data show that in normal subjects, administration of three glucocorticoid preparations caused a significant decrease in glucocorticoid binding sites and a
two-fold increase in binding affinity when assayed at
physiological temperature. a similar finding was
recently reported in cultured human t lymphocytes
which showed decreased basal and mitogen stimulated  xxxg1601xxx  after incubation with
cortisol[13].
however, two other reports, one in
patients with “clinical symptoms of hypercortisolemia” and one in acth treated goats showed no

discussion

a  xxxg1601xxx  has been demonstrated in
many types of white blood cells[l@-121. human t
and b lymphocytes have similar binding parameters
when examined in a whole cell assay whereas monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes have a substantially higher receptor concentration [s, lo]. in
any assessment of the regulation of the glucocorticoid
receptor using human leukocytes, it is imperative that
the studies be performed in a uniform cell population.
cell preparations containing large numbers of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes would give
erroneously high estimations of receptor content
when compared to cell preparations composed predominantly of lymphocytes.

that loss of a small subpopulation of lymphocytes
after glucocorticoid administration accounts for the
change in the number of binding sites.
it is possible that the decreased number of binding
sites is due to a down regulation of glucocorticoid
binding sites after administration of glucocorticoids.
modulation of receptor number and affinity by variations in hormone concentration has been well described for cell surface receptors in polypeptide hormones [l-3]. changes in steroid hormone levels
might be expected to have similar effects on steroid
receptors. estradiol produces an augmentation

uterine and anterior pituitary cytoplasmic
