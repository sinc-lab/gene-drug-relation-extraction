1 cp 55,244, (-)-1l-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol, win 55,212-2, a9-tetrahydrocannabinol, nabilone and anandamide each inhibited electrically-evoked contractions of the mouse
isolated urinary bladder in a concentration-related manner, their ec50 values being respectively 15.9,
18.27, 27.23, 1327.6, 1341.5 and 4950.3 nm. (+)-11-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol
was inactive at the highest concentration used (10 gm).
2 sr141716a (31.62 or 100 nm) produced parallel rightward shifts in the log concentration-response
curves of cp 55,244, (-)-l 1-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol, win 55,212-2, a9tetrahydrocannabinol and anandamide for inhibition of electrically-evoked bladder contractions. the
effect of the antagonist on the log concentration-response curve of cp 55,244 was shown to depend on
the concentration of sr141716a used (31.62 to 1000 nm).
3 the amplitudes of contractions evoked by acetylcholine or ,b, y-methylene-l-atp were not decreased
by 316.2 nm cp 55,244 or 3162 nm a9-tetrahydrocannabinol. electrically-evoked contractions were
almost completely abolished by 200 nm tetrodotoxin.
4 the above results support the hypothesis that mouse urinary bladder contains prejunctional cb1
cannabinoid receptors which can mediate inhibition of electrically-evoked contractions, probably by
reducing contractile transmitter release.
5 am 630 which behaves as a cannabinoid receptor antagonist in the mouse isolated vas deferens did
not antagonize the ability of cp 55,244 or a9-tetrahydrocannabinol to inhibit electrically-evoked
contractions of the mouse bladder.
6 sr141716a produced small but significant increases in the amplitude of electrically-evoked
contractions of the bladder suggesting that this tissue may release an endogenous cannabinoid receptor
agonist or that some cannabinoid receptors in this tissue are precoupled to the effector system.

introduction
previous experiments have shown that cannabinoids can inhibit
electrically-evoked contractions of isolated tissue preparations
including the vas deferens of mouse, rat and guinea-pig and
myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparations of mouse
and guinea-pig small intestine (pacheco et al., 1991; pertwee et
al., 1992; 1993). in this investigation we have looked to see
whether the ability of cannabinoids to inhibit electrically-evoked
contractions of innervated smooth muscle preparations extends
to the mouse urinary bladder, there being evidence that cannabinoids can relieve bladder spasms in patients with multiple
sclerosis (see pertwee, 1995). experiments were carried out with
representatives of all known chemical classes of cannabinoid
receptor agonist: a9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cp 55,244, win
55,212-2 and anandamide (see pertwee, 1995). the effect of
nabilone, a synthetic analogue of a9-tetrahydrocannabinol, was
also investigated as this cannabinoid has been successfully administered to a multiple sclerosis patient (martyn et al., 1995).
as the results obtained indicated that cannabinoids can inhibit
electrically-evoked contractions of the mouse bladder, further
experiments were carried out to establish whether this effect is
mediated by cannabinoid receptors. this was achieved firstly by
carrying out experiments with the selective cannabinoid cb,
receptor antagonist, sr141 716a (rinaldi-carmona et al., 1994)
and secondly by comparing the potencies of ( + )-and (- )-l 1hydroxy-l', l'-dimethyl -heptyl - delta-8 -tetrahydrocannabinol,
the stereochemical purity of which is particularly high (see
mechoulam & fride, 1995). experiments were also carried out
with am 630 (pertwee et al., 1995a) which, like sr141716a

(rinaldi-carmona et al., 1994; pertwee et al., 1995b), behaves as
a competitive cannabinoid receptor antagonist in the mouse
isolated vas deferens.

methods

electrical stimulation
urinary bladders were obtained from albino mf1 mice
weighing 32 to 59 g. each animal was killed by cervical dislocation and the whole bladder removed and placed in krebs
solution at 370c. two parallel longitudinal cuts were now
made, one along each lateral wall so that the upper and lower
walls could be drawn apart to form a single strip with the apex
of the bladder at its midpoint. each strip was mounted vertically in a 4 ml organ bath at an initial tension of 0.5 g. the
baths contained krebs solution which was kept at 37Â°c and
bubbled with 95% 02 and 5% co2. the composition of the
krebs solution was (mm): nacl 118.2, kcl 4.75,  xxxd2534xxx .7h20
1.29, kh2po4 1.19, nahco3 25.0, glucose 11.0 and cacl2.6h20 2.54. isometric contractions were evoked by stimulation
with 0.5 s trains of three pulses of 110% maximal voltage
(train frequency 0.1 hz; pulse duration 0.5 ms) through platinum and stainless steel electrodes attached to the upper and
lower ends of each bath respectively. stimuli were generated by
a grass s48 stimulator, then amplified (med-lab channel attenuator) and divided to yield separate outputs to four organ
baths (med-lab stimusplitter). contractions were monitored
by computer (apple macintosh performa 475) by use of a data
recording and analysis system (maclab) that was linked via
preamplifiers (macbridge) to uf1 transducers (morro bay).

tissues were subjected to several periods of stimulation, each
followed by a stimulation-free period (see below). the first
period of stimulation was initiated after the tissue had equilibrated and continued for 10 min. subsequent stimulation
periods lasted 5 min and after each of these, the bath was
washed out by overflow.

experiments without sr141716a or tween 80
pretreatment
these experiments were performed with cp 55,244, (+)-and
(-) - 11 - hydroxy - dimethylheptyl - a8 - tetrahydrocannabinol,
win 55,212-2, a9-tetrahydrocannabinol, nabilone, anandamide and am 630. drug additions were made immediately after
the 10 min stimulation period (time zero) and also after each
bath wash. each stimulation free period that followed a drug
addition lasted 80 min for 11-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol and 50 min for the other compounds tested.

experiments with sr141716a
sr141716a was added immediately after the first stimulation
period of 10 min (time zero) after which there was a stimulationfree period of 25 min. additions of sr141716a followed by
agonist were made after each 5 min stimulation period and
subsequent bath wash. the stimulation-free period after each
addition of agonist again lasted 10 min for win 55,212-2,
70 min for 11-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocanna-binol and 40 min for the other compounds tested. control experiments were carried out with the same doses of tween 80 (0.12
to 3.7 gig) as those added in combination with sr141716a.
these experiments indicated that tween 80 had no significant
effect on the position of the log concentration-response curve of
any of the agonists under investigation (data not shown). it was
not possible to reverse the inhibitory effect of cannabinoids on
the twitch response by washing them out of the organ bath.
consequently only one concentration-response curve was constructed per tissue.

cannabinoid receptors in mouse urinary bladder

analysis of data
values are expressed as means and limits of error as standard
degree of inhibition of the twitch response by
cannabinoid receptor agonists is expressed in percentage terms.
this was calculated by comparing the amplitude of the electrically-evoked twitch response immediately before agonist
administration with the amplitude of the twitch response at
various times after agonist administration. the concentration
of a cannabinoid that produced 50% of its maximum inhibitory effect on the twitch response (ec50) was used to
characterize its potency. contractile responses to acetylcholine
and fi, 'y-methylene-l-atp are expressed in g.
in experiments with sr141716a, concentration-response
curves of cp 55,244 were constructed in the presence of several
concentrations of the antagonist so that kd values could be
calculated from the slope (likd) of the best-fit straight line of a
plot of (x -1) against b, constrained to pass through the origin
(tallarida et al., 1979). the equation for this graph is
(x - 1) = b/kd, where x (the 'concentration-ratio') is the concentration of an agonist that produces a particular degree of
inhibition in the presence of sr141716a at a concentration, b,
divided by the concentration of the same agonist that produces
an identical degree of inhibition in the absence of sr141716a.
concentration-ratio values and their 95% confidence limits
were determined by symmetrical (2 + 2) dose parallel line
assays (colquhoun, 1971), by use of responses to pairs of
agonist concentrations located on the steepest part of each
log concentration-response curve. kd values of sr141716a
determined from experiments with agonists other than cp
55,940 were each calculated by substituting a single concentration-ratio value into the above equation. non-linear or
linear regression analysis was used to calculate ec50 values,
values of l/kd and 95% confidence limits (graphpad inplot, graphpad software, san diego). mean values were
compared by student's t test for unpaired data or by analysis
of variance followed by scheffe's test (super anova, abacus
concepts inc., berkeley). a p value < 0.05 was considered to
be significant.

the (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1 1-hydroxy-dimethylheptyla8-tetrahydrocannabinol were synthesized by professor
raphael mechoulam, university of jerusalem, and am 630, 6iodo-pravadoline and anandamide by professor alexandros
makriyannis, university of connecticut. a9-tetrahydrocannabinol was obtained from the national institute on drug
abuse, cp 55,244, 4-[4-(1,1-dimethyl-heptyl)-2-hydroxypheny]6-hydroxymethyl-decahydronaphthalen-2-ol from pfizer, nabilone from lilly, win 55,212-2, mesylate (r)-( + )-[2,3-dihydro5-methyl-3-[(4 -morpholino)methyl]pyrrolo-[1,2,3-de]- 1,4 -benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthyl)methanone from sanofi winthrop

by sigma and /b, y-methylene-l-atp by research biochemicals
international. these were both dissolved in saline. tetrodotoxin
(sigma) was dissolved in krebs solution. other drugs were
mixed with 2 parts of tween 80 by weight and dispersed in a
0.9% aqueous solution of nacl (saline) as described previously
for a9-tetrahydrocannabinol (pertwee et al., 1992). all drug
additions were made in a volume of 10 pl.

results

effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists on evoked
bladder contractions
cp 55,244, (-)-1 1-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol, win 55,212-2, a9-tetrahydrocannabinol and
anandamide all inhibited electrically-evoked contractions of
the mouse isolated bladder. nabilone was also inhibitory, its
log concentration-response curve being almost identical to that
of a9-tetrahydrocannabinol. (-)-1 l-hydroxy-dimethylheptyla8-tetrahydrocannabinol took 75 min to produce its full inhibitory effects on electrically-evoked contractions whereas the
other cannabinoids took 45 min (data not shown). the inhibitory effect of cannabinoids was found to be dose-related
(figure 1) and their log concentration-response curves to be
essentially sigmoid in shape (r2 = or> 0.95). mean ec50 values
and r2 values calculated by non-linear regression analysis are
given in table 1. the electrically-evoked twitch response of the
bladder was not affected by (+)-1l-hydroxy-dimethylheptyla8-tetrahydrocannabinol, even at a concentration of 10 gm
(figure 1).
the amplitudes of contractions of the bladder elicited by
acetylcholine or ,b, y-methylene-l-atp were not decreased by a
concentration of a9-tetrahydrocannabinol that produced a
marked inhibition of electrically-evoked contractions (figures
1 and 2). cp 55,244 (316.2 nm) also had no inhibitory effect on
contractile responses of the bladder to either acetylcholine or
fi, y-methylene-l-atp (data not shown). tetrodotoxin
(200 nm) depressed the contractile response of the bladder to
electrical stimulation by 86.5 + 1.8% (n = 6).

effects of sr141716a and am 630
as shown in figures 3 and 4, concentrations of sr141716a
ranging from 31.62 to 1000 nm produced rightward shifts in
the log concentration-response curves of cp 55,244, (-)win
1 1-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol,
55,212-2, a9-tetrahydrocannabinol, nabilone and anandamide.
none of these rightward shifts deviated significantly from
parallelism. the effect of sr141716a on the ability of cp
55,244 to inhibit electrically-evoked bladder contractions was
found to be dose-related (figure 4). kd values of sr141716a
calculated from our data by schild analysis are listed in table
1. these suggest that the cannabinoid receptor agonists used in
the present investigation do not differ significantly in their
susceptibility to antagonism by sr141716a. at concentrations
of 100 nm or more sr141716a produced small but significant
increases in the amplitude of electrically-evoked contractions
of the bladder (figure 5).
am 630 (1000 nm) did not significantly alter the position of
the log concentration-response curve of either a9-tetra-

hydrocannabinol or cp 55,244 (data not shown). nor did
concentrations of am 630 ranging from 100 to 3162 nm have
any detectable effect on the amplitude of electrically-evoked
contractions of the bladder.

discussion
the results obtained show that a range of cannabinoid cb,
receptor agonists have the ability to inhibit electrically-evoked
contractions of the mouse isolated urinary bladder in a concentration-related manner. the inhibitory effects of all these
agonists were attenuated by submicromolar concentrations of
the selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist, sr141716a,
(rinaldi-carmona et al., 1994), pointing to an involvement of
cannabinoid receptors. we also found that whereas (-)-11hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol is a potent
inhibitor of electrically-evoked bladder contractions, the corresponding (+ )-enantiomer has no inhibitory effect even at a
concentration of 10 glm. because (-)-1 1-hydroxy-di-

methylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol has a far greater affinity for cannabinoid cb, and cb2 binding sites than its (+ )enantiomer (compton et al., 1993; slipetz et al., 1995), this
observation is a further indication that cannabinoid-induced
inhibition of electrically-evoked bladder contractions may be
mediated by cannabinoid receptors. there is some evidence to
suggest that these receptors are cb1 rather than cb2 receptors.
thus the kd values of sr141716a calculated from our data
(table 1) differ little from the ki value of sr141716a determined from its ability to compete with [3h]-cp 55,940 for
cb1 binding sites; the affinity of sr141716a for cb2 binding
sites has been found to be markedly less than its affinity for
cb1 binding sites (rinaldi-carmona et al., 1994; felder et al.,
1995).

the involvement of cannabinoid cb2 receptors in the effects
of cannabinoids on the bladder that we describe in this paper
cannot yet be ruled out altogether. thus for several of the
cannabinoids that we used, there is good agreement between
rank order of potency for inhibition of electrically-evoked
bladder contractions and that for competition with a radiolabelled probe for cb2 binding sites [(-)- 1-hydroxy-dimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol > win 55,212-2 >>
a9-tetrahydrocannabinol> anandamide >> (+ )-l 1-hydroxydimethylheptyl-a8-tetrahydrocannabinol] (felder et al., 1995;
slipetz et al., 1995). in addition, although win 55,212-2 is
more potent than a9-tetrahydrocannabinol both as an inhibitor of electrically-evoked bladder contractions and as a
cb2 receptor agonist, it is less potent than a9-tetra-

hydrocannabinol as a  xxxg479xxx  agonist, in at least one
mammalian cell line (felder et al., 1995). it is noteworthy,
however, that apart from win 55,212-2, all the cannabinoid
agonists that we used in this investigation have a similar rank
order of potency for inhibition of electrically-evoked bladder
contractions as for the displacement of a radiolabelled probe
from cb, binding sites (herkenham et al., 1990; felder et al.,
1992; 1995; compton et al., 1993; hillard et al., 1995).
moreover, cannabinoid cb2 receptors have so far only been
found to occur naturally in cells of the immune system.
bladder contractions evoked by electrical stimulation were
almost completely abolished by tetrodotoxin, a specific na'
channel blocker. this suggests that the main effect of the electrical stimuli that we applied to the bladder was to provoke
contractions indirectly by stimulating the release of contractile
transmitters from prejunctional nerve terminals. the ability of
cannabinoids to inhibit electrically-evoked bladder contractions
may well depend on an ability to suppress the release of these
transmitters rather than on some ability to interact directly with
smooth muscle. acetylcholine and atp are both thought to
serve as contractile transmitters in the urinary bladder of rodents
(burnstock et al., 1972; brown et al., 1979; boland et al., 1993)
and our experiments with mouse bladder showed that concentrations of cp 55,244 or a9-tetrahydrocannabinol which had
a marked depressant effect on electrically-evoked contractions
did not attenuate contractions induced by acetylcholine or by
the stable atp analogue, f8, y-methylene-l-atp.
am 630, at a concentration of 1 gum, did not attenuate the
inhibitory effects of the cannabinoid receptor agonists, a9tetrahydrocannabinol or cp 55,244, on mouse bladder. this
observation contrasts with results from previous experiments
with the mouse isolated vas deferens in which am 630 was
found to behave as a reasonably potent cannabinoid receptor
antagonist (pertwee et al., 1995a). nor did am 630 affect the
amplitude of electrically-evoked bladder contractions when
administered by itself. this also contrasts with another pre-

tions were exposed to 100nm sr141716a (hatched column) or to
tween 80 (open column). each column represents the mean value of
the change in the amplitude of contractions expressed as a percentage
of the amplitude measured immediately before the addition of
sr141716a or tween 80 to the organ bath (n = 32 and 29 different
bladders, respectively); vertical lines indicate s.e.mean. the asterisks
indicate the significance of differences between mean amplitudes
before and 30min after addition of sr141716a or tween 80
(p<0.01; student's t test for paired data).

vious finding, that am 630 behaves as a cannabinoid cb,
receptor agonist in the myenteric plexus preparation of guineapig small intestine (pertwee et al., 1996a). the question of why
am 630 should behave so differently in these three tissues has
yet to be addressed.
in the absence of other drugs, sr141716a produced small
but significant increases in the amplitude of electrically-evoked
contractions. this may be because mouse bladder can itself
produce a cannabinoid cb, receptor agonist and that this
exerts an inhibitory effect on evoked contractions that can be
reversed by sr141716a. possible candidates for this endogenous cannabinoid include anandamide, although this has
so far been detected only in the brain (devane et al., 1992), and
2-arachidonylglycerol which has been found peripherally, albeit so far only in canine intestine (mechoulam et al., 1995).
the effect of sr141716a on twitch amplitude can also be
explained in terms of a two-state receptor model (see leff,
1995) provided it is assumed that cannabinoid receptors in
mouse bladder can exist both in an activated state which can
couple to the signal transduction system and in an inactivated
state which cannot, that these two states are normally in
equilibrium, that even when unoccupied some cannabinoid
receptors in the bladder are in the activated state and that
sr141716a binds preferentially to the inactivated state. if
these assumptions are valid, then sr141716a would be expected to shift the equilibrium away from the activated state
thereby causing a reduction in the number of precoupled receptors and hence a disinhibition of the twitch amplitude.
according to this hypothesis sr141716a behaves as an inverse
agonist rather than a pure antagonist in mouse bladder (see
leff, 1995). if this is true, than the kd values of sr141716a
listed in table 2 may provide an overestimate of the real ability
of this compound to bind to cannabinoid receptors in the
bladder (see kenakin, 1993).
in conclusion, the present results lend further support to
the hypothesis that cannabinoid cb, receptors are present on
peripheral nerve terminals in at least some tissues. thus there
is evidence that receptors with which cannabinoids can interact to inhibit electrically-evoked contractions are to be
found not only in the mouse urinary bladder but also in the
vas deferens of mouse, guinea-pig and rat and the small in-

testine of mouse and guinea-pig (pacheco et al., 1991; paterson & pertwee, 1993; pertwee et al., 1992; 1993; 1995b,
1996b; rinaldi-carmona et al., 1994). for some of these
tissues at least, the mouse vas deferens (pertwee & griffin,
1995), the guinea-pig small intestine (pertwee, 1990; pertwee
et al., 1996a) and the mouse urinary bladder (this paper),
there is also evidence that this inhibitory effect is mediated by
prejunctional cannabinoid cb, receptors that inhibit contractile transmitter release when activated. cannabinoid receptors are also thought to be present on nerve terminals in
the brain (herkenham et al., 1991). it remains to be established whether modulation of transmitter release by cannabinoid receptors is ever initiated by endogenously released
cannabinoids and, therefore, of physiological significance.

cannabinoid receptors in mouse urinary bladder
also still to be established is the extent to which the ability of
cannabinoids to relieve bladder spasms experienced by some
patients with multiple sclerosis (see pertwee, 1995) is mediated by cannabinoid cb1 receptors located on the terminals
of neurones innervating the bladder.
