abstract
 xxxd2486xxx , a potent  xxxg1587xxx  c agonist, is a therapeutic peptide approved in the united states for the treatment of
irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. we present for the first time the metabolism,
degradation, and disposition of  xxxd2486xxx  in animals and humans. we examined the metabolic stability of  xxxd2486xxx  in conditions that mimic the gastrointestinal tract and characterized
the metabolite mm-419447 (cceyccnpactgc), which contributes to the pharmacologic effects of  xxxd2486xxx . systemic
exposure to these active peptides is low in rats and humans, and
the low systemic and portal vein concentrations of  xxxd2486xxx 
and mm-419447 observed in the rat confirmed both peptides
are minimally absorbed after oral administration.  xxxd2486xxx  is
stable in the acidic environment of the stomach and is converted
to mm-419447 in the small intestine. the disulfide bonds of both

introduction
peptide therapeutics represent an emerging class of drugs
with great pharmacologic potential because of their high
specificity, affinity, and molecular target recognition (yu
et al., 2004).  xxxd2486xxx  is a novel, orally administered 14amino acid peptide approved for the treatment of irritable
bowel syndrome with constipation (ibs-c) and chronic
idiopathic constipation (cic) (wensel and luthin, 2011;
lembo et al., 2011; chey et al., 2012; rao et al., 2012).
 xxxd2486xxx  is a potent  xxxg1587xxx  c ( xxxg1004xxx ) agonist and
member of the  xxxg1001xxx  family of peptides known to regulate

peptides are reduced in the small intestine, where they are
subsequently proteolyzed and degraded. after oral administration of  xxxd2486xxx , ,1% of the dose was excreted as active
peptide in rat feces and a mean of 3â€“5% in human feces; in both
cases mm-419447 was the predominant peptide recovered.
mm-419447 exhibits high-affinity binding in vitro to t84 cells,
resulting in a significant, concentration-dependent accumulation of intracellular cyclic guanosine-39,59-monophosphate
(cgmp). in rat models of gastrointestinal function, orally dosed
mm-419447 significantly increased fluid secretion into small
intestinal loops, increased intraluminal cgmp, and caused
a dose-dependent acceleration in gastrointestinal transit. these
results demonstrate the importance of the active metabolite in
contributing to  xxxd2486xxx â€™s pharmacology.

cyclic guanosine-39,59-monophosphate (cgmp) (currie et al.,
1992; forte, 2004; hamra et al., 1993) through their activity
at  xxxg1004xxx . the endogenous peptide hormones  xxxg1001xxx  and
 xxxg1002xxx  act on  xxxg1004xxx  expressed on the luminal surface of
intestinal epithelial cells (wiegand et al., 1992; fan et al.,
1996; hamra et al., 1996, 1997; schulz et al., 1990) to regulate
intestinal fluid secretion in response to a meal.
 xxxd2486xxx  binds to  xxxg1004xxx  with high affinity in a phindependent manner, stimulates the intracellular production
of cgmp, and elicits its potent pharmacologic response locally
in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract with very low oral bioavailability (busby et al., 2010). experiments in genetically
modified mice lacking the gene encoding  xxxg1004xxx  (gucy22/2)
have shown that this receptor is the molecular target of
 xxxd2486xxx  (bryant et al., 2010). in addition to increasing fluid
secretion and accelerating gi transit,  xxxd2486xxx  has also

materials and methods
linacotide, mm-421202 (ccey), mm-421522 (ccnpactgcy), and
[13c1]ala- xxxd2486xxx  were obtained from polypeptide laboratories
(torrance, ca). mm-419447 (cceyccnpactgc) was synthesized at
polypeptide laboratories (wolfenbuettel, germany). mm-420026
([15n13c9] xxxd2486xxx ), mm-437150 ([15n13c9] mm-419447), and human
heat-stable enterotoxin ( xxxg2231xxx ) were synthesized at american peptide
company (sunnyvale, ca). human  xxxg1001xxx  was purchased from
peptide institute, inc. (osaka, japan). bovine insulin, pepsin,

chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase a, pancreatin, and iodoacetamide
were obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). trypsin was
purchased from promega (madison, wi), and aminopeptidase was
purchased from emd chemicals (gibbstown, nj).
heat-stable enterotoxin from porcine origin (psta) was purchased
from sigma-aldrich and bachem americas (torrance, ca) and was
radioiodinated at perkinelmer life and analytical sciences (north
billerica, ma). iodination of psta produces two monoiodinated
molecules; the one labeled at tyr4 (thompson et al., 1985) was
purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and
used for radioligand binding competition studies, while the other,
labeled at tyr18, was used for radioimmunoassay (specific activity
2,200 ci/mmol). monoclonal antibodies to psta were a gift from
dr. ralph giannella, university of cincinnati (brandwein et al.,
1985). bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) was obtained from thermo
fisher scientific (waltham, ma). sheep anti-mouse igg beads were
obtained from invitrogen (carlsbad, ca).
animals. male and female sprague-dawley (cd) rats were
obtained from charles river laboratories (wilmington, ma) and
were housed in an environmentally controlled room. all animal
studies were approved by the ironwood pharmaceuticals institutional
animal care and use committee.
stability of  xxxd2486xxx  in vitro. the methods used to study
the stability of  xxxd2486xxx  in simulated gastric fluid and in the
presence of pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, aminopeptidase, and
carboxypeptidase a are described in supplemental methods.
determining systemic and portal vein concentrations of
 xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 after oral administration of
 xxxd2486xxx  to female rats. two cohorts consisting of four female
sprague-dawley rats each were used in the study; one group (group 1)
was equipped with surgically implanted jugular vein cannulas, and
the second group (group 2) was equipped with portal vein cannulas.
all animals received a single oral gavage of 10 mg/kg  xxxd2486xxx , and
systemic blood samples were collected from group 1 via the jugular
vein cannulas before dosing and 0.08 (5 minutes), 0.33 (20 minutes),
0.67 (40 minutes), 1, 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, and 24 hours after dosing. portal
vein blood samples were collected from the animals in group 2 at the
same designated time points via the portal vein cannulas. plasma was
extracted from the blood samples and was analyzed for  xxxd2486xxx  and
mm-419447 using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) as described in supplemental methods.
determination of the absolute oral bioavailability of mm419447 in female rats. to determine the absolute oral bioavailability
of mm-419447, four groups (n 5 3) of female rats received mm419447 (10 mg/kg) intravenously (i.v.), and four groups (n 5 3)
received mm-419447 (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage. blood was drawn by
retro-orbital eye bleeding at specific time intervals and was frozen
for subsequent lc-ms/ms analysis as described in supplemental
methods. the limit of detection for mm-419447 in rat plasma was 1
ng/ml. oral bioavailability (f) was calculated using the following
equation:

method for quantitative determination of  xxxd2486xxx  and
mm-419447 in human plasma.  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 were
extracted from human plasma 2 hours after oral dosing of  xxxd2486xxx 
(see supplemental methods). the plasma was analyzed for  xxxd2486xxx 
and mm-419447 concentrations using lc-ms/ms as described in
supplemental methods.
recovery of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 from rat feces
after oral dosing. three female cd rats weighing approximately
180 g were included in this study. three hundred ml of a 6 mg/ml
solution of  xxxd2486xxx  (in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5) was administered
orally to all rats using a disposable feeding needle. animals were
individually housed and placed on wire grids in lined cages to ensure
that all feces were collected. feces were collected every hour over

been shown to have potent  xxxg1004xxx -mediated analgesic effects in
several mechanistically different rodent models of visceral
hypersensitivity (eutamene et al., 2010).
these distinct pharmacologic effects on relieving pain and
accelerating gi transit have been observed clinically (andresen
et al., 2007; johnston et al., 2010). phase 3 studies have shown
that  xxxd2486xxx  treatment results in a significant reduction in
abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and constipation symptoms in ibs-c patients (roque and camilleri, 2011; chey et al.,
2012; rao et al., 2012) and improves bowel and abdominal
symptoms in chronic constipation patients (lembo et al., 2010).
thus,  xxxg1004xxx  appears to be a promising therapeutic target for
the treatment of functional gi disorders such as ibs-c and
cic.
orally administered peptides typically have low absolute
oral bioavailability, so achieving systemic plasma concentrations is often a challenge; however, this is an advantage
with  xxxd2486xxx , as the ligand-binding domain of the  xxxg1004xxx 
target is located on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial
cells and systemic exposure is not necessary for  xxxd2486xxx  to
exert its pharmacologic effects.
effective pharmacotherapy with  xxxd2486xxx  depends on
the local concentrations present within the intestinal tract.
this therapeutic goal is challenged by the varied and harsh
environments along the gi tract, which decrease the amount
of active peptide available. these environments include
vastly different ph conditions ranging from ph 2.0 in the
stomach up to ph 8.0 in the duodenum, as well as proteolytic
enzymes such as gastric hydrolases (pepsins), pancreatic
hydrolases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, aminopeptidases, and carboxypeptidases a and b), and intestinal
brush-border membrane-bound enzymes (carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, and aminopeptidases), which are
also involved in peptide degradation (johnson et al., 1994;
wilkinson, 1997; sanderink et al., 1988; woodley, 1994).
this extensive system of presystemic metabolism and
degradation has evolved to digest ingested proteins and
large peptides into small, absorbable dipeptides and tripeptides and single amino acids (daniel, 2004). in addition to ph
instability and/or proteolytic degradation, peptide drugs
containing disulfide bonds are inactivated by the reduction
of these bonds in the gi tract. these reactions are performed
by the  xxxg905xxx / xxxg981xxx  and thioredoxin/
 xxxg1826xxx  systems, integral parts of the antioxidant defense system in the gi tract (fernandes and
holmgren, 2004; zahedi avval and holmgren, 2009).
in the studies described here, we have investigated the
pharmacologic properties, metabolism, and disposition of
 xxxd2486xxx  as well as the role the active metabolite plays in
contributing to the pharmacologic effects of orally dosed
 xxxd2486xxx .

duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (prepared as described in supplemental methods). loops were injected with either 200 ml of mm419447 (5 mg),  xxxd2486xxx  (5 mg), or vehicle (krgh), and the animals
were allowed to recover for 90 minutes before sacrifice. the loops were
excised, and the length and weight of each intestinal loop was
recorded both before and after collection of the intestinal fluid
content. a weight-to-length ratio (w/l) was calculated and expressed
as a percentage of the control value, a commonly used surrogate to
measure intestinal secretion (thiagarajah et al., 2004).
gastrointestinal transit in rats. a well-established model was
used to measure gi transit in the upper gi tract, since measurements
of colonic transit in rats have proven difficult due to the reservoir
function of the cecum during periods of intestinal hypersecretion
(fondacaro et al., 1990). female cd rats 6 to 8 weeks of age were
fasted for 18 to 24 hours before treatment, but had access to water ad
libitum during this period. the rats (n 5 10/group, except the 6.25 mg/
kg group of n 5 5) were administered oral doses (300 ml) of either
mm-419447 (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg),  xxxd2486xxx  (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 mg/
kg), or vehicle (20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5) immediately before an oral
dose of 10% activated carbon/10% gum arabic powder suspension (500
ml in water). after 10 minutes, the animals were euthanized, and their
intestines, from the pyloric junction to the cecum, were removed. the
gi transit is expressed as the percentage of the distance traveled by
the charcoal front compared with the total length of the intestine.
studies following the same protocol were also performed in male cd
rats.
statistical analysis. the determination of statistical significance of data were performed using either a one-way or two-way
analysis of variance (anova), followed by unpaired two-tailed
studentâ€™s t test or wilcoxon and mann-whitney tests. all values are
expressed as the mean 6 s.e.m. p , 0.05 is considered statistically
significant.

results
proteolytic and acid stability of  xxxd2486xxx  in
vitro.  xxxd2486xxx  was stable in simulated gastric fluid for
at least 3 hours at 37Â°c, indicating that it is not degraded
under the acidic conditions present in the stomach.  xxxd2486xxx 
was not digested during 3 hours of in vitro incubation with
trypsin or pepsin, while insulin, a known substrate of these
proteases, was digested. similarly,  xxxd2486xxx  was not digested
by aminopeptidase or chymotrypsin, while the control peptides
( xxxg2231xxx  for aminopeptidase and  xxxg1001xxx  for chymotrypsin)
were rapidly hydrolyzed.
incubation of  xxxd2486xxx  with carboxypeptidase a resulted
in the formation of a single reaction product designated as
mm-419447 (fig. 1). the rate of  xxxd2486xxx  loss under these
conditions was equal to the rate of appearance of mm-419447
(fig. 1), with almost complete conversion of  xxxd2486xxx  to
mm-419447 after 6 hours of digestion with carboxypeptidase
a. to confirm the structure of mm-419447, the peptide was
synthesized and shown to have the same retention time in
uplc as that of the peptide produced from  xxxd2486xxx  after
digestion with carboxypeptidase a. the observed m/z ([m 1
h]1) value for the mm-419447 product of  xxxd2486xxx  digestion
with carboxypeptidase a was 1363.3333, and the observed m/z
([m 1 h]1) value for mm-419447 synthesized by solid phase
(1363.3319) were both within 1.8 ppm of the theoretical value
predicted for this peptide (1363.3344). these observations
identified mm-419447 as a peptide with an exact mass of
1362.3266 da (elemental composition of c50h70n14o19s6),
corresponding to the metabolite of  xxxd2486xxx  that lacks the
c-terminal tyr14 residue. carboxypeptidases digest proteins

55 hours after dosing. the total weight of feces collected at each
time point was recorded. the feces were stored at 220Â°c until
analysis. the concentrations of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 in the
feces were determined by lc-ms/ms as described in supplemental
methods.
extraction and fractionation of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm419447 from human feces.  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 were
extracted from human feces using a bond elute plexa solid-phase
extraction (spe) plate. approximately 15 g of sample was homogenized
in a blender with three volumes of deionized water (w/v) containing
internal standard (mm-420026). the supernatant of a 2-g aliquot
from each sample was filtered through a whatman 0.2-mm polyvinylidene difluoride glass microfiber syringe filter (whatman,
clifton, nj) and loaded onto the spe plate. the samples were
washed with 5% methanol in water and eluted from the plate with
100% methanol. the samples were evaporated under nitrogen and
reconstituted in 20% acetonitrile and 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in water. a 40ml injection of the extract was analyzed with an lc-ms/ms assay
using a  xxxd3100xxx  gold column (3-mm particle, 2.1  50 mm).
the hplc method used a binary buffer system with 5% acetonitrile
and 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in water as the weak solvent (a) and 20%
acetonitrile and 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in water as the strong solvent (b).
the hplc gradient started with 50% b for 4 minutes, ramped down
to 10% over the next 3.5 minutes and returned back to 50% b after 30
seconds. the analytes were detected by a multiple reaction monitoring method using an applied biosystems api 5000 mass spectrometer
operating in positive ion electrospray ionization mode. the method
monitored the transitions 764 . 182 for  xxxd2486xxx , 682 . 136 for
mm-419447, and 769 . 192 for mm-420026 (is). the peak area ratios
of  xxxd2486xxx /is and mm-419447/is and the theoretical concentrations of calibration samples were fitted to the quadratic function with
1/x2 weighting, excluding the origin.
metabolism of  xxxd2486xxx  in vivo and in vitro. the stability
and metabolism of  xxxd2486xxx  were studied in vivo in surgically
ligated intestinal loops and in vitro in intestinal fluid extracted from
the small intestine of rodents and humans as described in supplemental methods.
competitive radioligand binding assays using human
t84 cells. competitive radioligand binding assays using t84 cells
and [125i]psta were conducted as described by busby et al. (2010).
competitive radioligand binding assays using rat intestinal brushborder membranes were conducted as described in supplemental
methods.
 xxxd1274xxx  accumulation in t84 cells and in fluid of
ligated intestinal loops. accumulation of cgmp in t84 cells was
conducted as described by busby et al. (2010). to assess the biologic
activity of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 when fully reduced, both
peptides were incubated in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol
(dtt) for 30 minutes at 37Â°c followed by alkylation with 50 mm
iodoacetamide for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. the
fully reduced and alkylated samples were then purified using spe to
remove excess dtt and iodoacetamide, quantitated using uplchrms (described in supplemental methods) and subjected to t84
cells grown in 96-well plates (250,000 cells/well) and compared with
fully oxidized parent peptides.  xxxd1274xxx  was quantified using lcms/ms.
to measure the amount of cgmp in fluid obtained from ligated rat
intestinal loops (n 5 10), the samples were immediately added to 6%
ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (tca) at a ratio (v/v) of 300 ml of tca to
100 ml of fluid sample and stored at 220Â°c until assayed. after
thawing on ice, the samples were homogenized for 30 seconds, and the
precipitate was removed by centrifugation (1500g, 10 minutes). tca
was extracted from each sample with water-saturated ether, and the
amount of cgmp in intestinal fluid samples was determined with
a competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (cayman chemical, ann arbor,
mi). all results are representative of several independent experiments.
intestinal fluid secretion. female cd rats (n 5 10/group) were
used to generate intestinal loops (1â€“3 cm in length) in the

pharmacology, metabolism, and disposition of  xxxd2486xxx 

by cleaving the peptide bonds at c-terminal amino acids, resulting in the removal of c-terminal amino acid residues. in the
case of  xxxd2486xxx , under nonreducing conditions the cleavage of
amino acids by carboxypeptidase a stops after the removal of
the first c-terminal amino acid, tyr14.
sensitivity of  xxxd2486xxx  to chymotrypsin and
pancreatin in the absence and presence of a reducing
agent.  xxxd2486xxx  in its native configuration was resistant
to digestion by chymotrypsin, even though the peptide contains a tyrosine residue at the fourth position, which is a site
predicted to be recognized by this protease. in addition, incubation of  xxxd2486xxx  with pancreatin, a mixture of proteases
isolated from pig pancreas that is known to contain carboxypeptidase a (bauer and miskinis, 1947), resulted only in
the generation of mm-419447. however, in the presence of
a reducing agent (5 mm dtt),  xxxd2486xxx  was digested by
chymotrypsin to two peptides (with sequences ccey and
ccnpactgcy after cleavage of the c-terminal side of the
tyr4) and to small peptide fragments by pancreatin.
absolute oral bioavailability of mm-419447 in rats.
previous pharmacokinetic studies showed that the oral
bioavailability of  xxxd2486xxx  was 0.1% after the administration of a single 10 mg/kg dose (busby et al., 2010). when
mm-419447 was measured in rat plasma in the same experiment, very small amounts of this metabolite were found,
demonstrating the generation of this metabolite in vivo.
the combined oral bioavailability of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm419447 was very low (0.13%), and the oral bioavailability
of mm-419447 after administration of a single 10 mg/kg
dose of mm-419447 was #0.1%, confirming that mm-419447
is a minimally absorbed peptide, similar to  xxxd2486xxx 
(table 1).
systemic and portal vein concentrations of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 after oral administration of
 xxxd2486xxx  to female rats. after oral dosing to spraguedawley rats, systemic exposure to  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447
was minimal, and the majority of the plasma, whether sampled
from the jugular or portal vein, had concentrations of the test
articles that were below the quantitation limits of 1 ng/ml
( xxxd2486xxx ) and 2 ng/ml (mm-419447) (fig. 2).

in systemic (jugular vein) circulation, the maximum observed  xxxd2486xxx  plasma concentration (cmax) in any animal
was 2.97 ng/ml, and the time of the maximum observed plasma
concentration (tmax) was 0.08 hours (5 minutes). the corresponding highest individual portal vein cmax was 5.95 ng/ml
and the tmax was 0.08 hours (5 minutes). for the metabolite,
the highest individual systemic cmax was 2.28 ng/ml, and the
highest individual portal vein cmax was 5.09 ng/ml. the
metabolite tmax in both cases was 0.08 hours (5 minutes). by
0.67 hours (40 minutes), both systemic and portal vein plasma
concentrations were below the lower limits of quantitation
(lloq) for  xxxd2486xxx  and the metabolite, with the exception
of animal 4, which had a systemic mm-419447 concentration
of 2.80 ng/ml at 3 hours. the systemic and portal vein pharmacokinetic profiles of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 after oral
dosing are shown in fig. 2. despite the high oral dose,
concentrations in the jugular and portal veins were consistently low (#6 ng/ml), indicating that the low absolute oral
bioavailability of both peptides is due to poor absorption.
recovery of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 from rat
feces after oral administration of  xxxd2486xxx . the
total  xxxd2486xxx  recovered from the feces of rats over 55 hours
after oral dosing (10 mg/kg), as measured by lc-ms/ms, was
0.03% of the dose in the form of  xxxd2486xxx  and an additional
0.95% in the form of the metabolite mm-419447. in all rats
tested, the majority of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 was
recovered in the first 24 hours after oral dosing.
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447
in humans after oral administration of  xxxd2486xxx . in
a phase 1, food-effect u.s. study, plasma samples from fed and
fasted subjects dosed with 290 mg of  xxxd2486xxx  once daily for 7
days showed no quantifiable concentrations of  xxxd2486xxx  or
mm-419447 (lloq 5 0.2 ng/ml for  xxxd2486xxx  and lloq 5
2.0 ng/ml for mm-419447). when  xxxd2486xxx  was administered as a single 10 dose (2897 mg) on the eighth day,
 xxxd2486xxx  concentrations were quantifiable in plasma from
2 of the 18 subjects (both fasted), and mm-419447 was not
detectable in the plasma of any subject (table 2). in the four
pivotal phase 3 trials in patients with ibs-c and cic, plasma
was sampled on day 1 and day 29 in 465 of 1654 patients who
received either 290 (n 5 313) or 145 mg (n 5 152) of  xxxd2486xxx .

were collected during the second period of dosing from fed and
fasted subjects after oral administration of 290 mg of  xxxd2486xxx 
once daily for 7 days, and then again after the administration of
a single 10 dose (2897 mg) on the eighth day. recovery of
active peptide ranged from 0 to 20% of the dose with a mean
of 3â€“5% of dosed  xxxd2486xxx . virtually all of the recovered active peptide was mm-419447, confirming that it is a human
metabolite (table 3).  xxxd2486xxx  was found in the stool samples
from subjects only after administration of the 2897-mg dose in
the fed state; these three subjects had a median of 0.4% of dosed
 xxxd2486xxx  in their stool. the amount of total recovered active
peptide was similar in fed and fasted subjects (table 3).
metabolism of  xxxd2486xxx  in vivo in surgically
ligated rat intestinal loops. the metabolism of  xxxd2486xxx  in surgically ligated rat intestinal loops was studied as
a function of time by injecting  xxxd2486xxx  in three locations
(duodenum, mid-jejunum, and ileum). the fluid inside the loops
was recovered at different times, and  xxxd2486xxx  was extracted
and quantified by radioimmunoassay.  xxxd2486xxx  was not
detectable within 5 minutes when incubated in duodenal and
jejunal loops (t1/2 5 0.4 minutes);  xxxd2486xxx  injected in ileal
loops was metabolized more slowly (t1/2 5 36 minutes).
metabolism of  xxxd2486xxx  in vitro in intestinal
fluid. to further explore the metabolism of  xxxd2486xxx  in
rodent intestine in vitro,  xxxd2486xxx  was incubated in
a solution obtained from ligated intestinal loops from rats,
and concentrations of active peptide were determined by
lc-ms/ms. a 30-minute incubation resulted in the complete
degradation of  xxxd2486xxx . mm-419447, the active metabolite,
formed almost immediately and reached a maximum concentration 10 minutes after incubation, after which the rate of
degradation exceeded the rate of formation. both peptides
were degraded within 60 minutes. a related pattern of metabolism and degradation was observed when  xxxd2486xxx  was
incubated in intestinal fluid from a mouse (data not shown).
 xxxd2486xxx  is metabolized in a similar manner in intestinal
fluid isolated from human cadavers, with immediate formation
of mm-419447 and subsequent degradation of this metabolite.
these experiments were performed using intestinal fluids
obtained from a particular region of the rodent or human

intestine (proximal jejunum) using different preparation
methods, so the results do not necessarily reflect the in vivo
kinetics of  xxxd2486xxx  metabolism/degradation after oral
administration. these experiments were conducted to study
only the process of  xxxd2486xxx  metabolism in the intestine.
pathway of  xxxd2486xxx  metabolism in rat intestinal
fluid. reaction conditions were chosen to trap intermediates
of the metabolism of  xxxd2486xxx  in rat intestinal fluid.
after incubation of  xxxd2486xxx  in diluted intestinal fluid
(10% loop fluid and 90% protein-filtered loop fluid), the
peptides detected included native  xxxd2486xxx , native mm419447,  xxxd2486xxx  with one reduced disulfide bond and two
cysteines, and mm-419447 with one disulfide bond reduced
and two cysteines. similar results were obtained when [13c1]
ala- xxxd2486xxx  was incubated under the conditions previously
described. these results indicate that reduction of the
disulfide bonds of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 is a necessary
initial step in their degradation in intestinal fluid.
in a second experiment, proteolytic fragments of  xxxd2486xxx 
and mm-419447 were trapped by slowing the reaction rate
with diluted intestinal fluid, stopping the metabolism by
removing proteins in the loop fluid using ultrafiltration, and
reducing and alkylating the resulting sulfhydryl groups with
iodoacetamide. accurate mass measurements from lc/ms
and ms/ms peptide sequencing were used to determine the
identities of the fragments. all incubations were performed
with  xxxd2486xxx  and [13c1]-ala- xxxd2486xxx  to confirm the
fragment identities. figure 3 shows a list of the fragments
of  xxxd2486xxx  that were detected in this experiment. the
fragments are listed in three groups representing various
digestion patterns (fig. 3). in these experiments, the digestion reactions were deliberately stopped at 15, 60, and 120
minutes to trap the reduced forms and peptide fragments.
after overnight incubation, the digestion products were
indistinguishable from the background species present in
a reaction conducted without  xxxd2486xxx  (not shown). supplemental fig. 1 shows the early appearance and then disappearance of selected peptide fragments of  xxxd2486xxx  resulting
from digestion in rat intestinal fluid as a function of time.
similar results were obtained when two fragments of

(data not shown).
when an analogous experiment was conducted using
a preparation of human intestinal fluid obtained from
cadavers, a subset of the proteolytic fragments of  xxxd2486xxx 
found in the rat experiment was observed (shown in fig. 3,

elicit detectable cgmp accumulation activity in t84 cells
when tested at 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nm (supplemental fig.
3a), but  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 in their oxidized forms
did (supplemental fig. 3a).
the peptides mm-421202 (ccey) and mm-421522
(ccnpactgcy) are two fragments detected after digestion
of  xxxd2486xxx  in rat intestinal fluid (fig. 3) that together
span the linear sequence of  xxxd2486xxx . mm-421202 and
mm-421522 were synthesized and tested for their ability to
stimulate cgmp synthesis in t84 cells. mm-421202 and
mm-421522 did not induce cgmp accumulation activity
in t84 cells when tested at 1, 100, and 1000 nm, concentrations at which  xxxd2486xxx  is active (supplemental
fig. 3b).

complete digestion of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 to
naturally occurring amino acids. to detect amino acids
as products of  xxxd2486xxx  metabolism in rat intestinal fluid, the
incubations were conducted for 23 hours at 37Â°c in reaction
mixtures containing 10% concentrated ligated rat intestinal
loop fluid, 90% phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) supplemented
with 2 mm  xxxd2213xxx , and 1 mm nadph. under
these conditions,  xxxd2486xxx , mm-42102, and mm-421522 were
completely digested (data not shown). supplemental table 1
summarizes the concentrations of amino acids measured using
uplc after digestion of these peptides under the conditions
described earlier and subsequent amino acid derivatization
using the accqâˆ™tag reagent. overnight incubation resulted in
complete digestion of the peptides, with quantitative recovery
of internal amino acids. in this experiment, twice as much
tyrosine was recovered from  xxxd2486xxx  as from mm-419447, as
expected from the sequences. also, there was no  xxxd2431xxx 
detected after complete digestion of mm-421522 because this
peptide lacks this amino acid residue. based on the amount of
 xxxd2486xxx  incubated, uplc analysis demonstrated nearly
quantitative recovery of the tyrosine, alanine, proline, and
asparagine amino acids as well as most of the threonine in the
 xxxd2486xxx  sample.

synthetic mm-419447 was tested for its affinity to cell surface
receptors in t84 cells. when mm-419447 was tested in
a competitive radioligand-binding assay with [125i]-psta,
a known agonist of  xxxg1004xxx , the binding of mm-419447 to cellsurface receptors on t84 cells was very similar to that of
 xxxd2486xxx  at ph 7.0 (supplemental fig. 2; table 4). likewise,
mm-419447 binds cell-surface receptors in rat small intestine
brush-border membranes (ph 7.0) with a relative affinity comparable to  xxxd2486xxx  (table 4). the binding of
mm-419447 to receptors on t84 cells at ph 5.0 and 8.0 is also
comparable to that of  xxxd2486xxx , indicating that the binding
affinities of  xxxd2486xxx  and its metabolite are ph independent.
comparison of the competitive binding curves of  xxxd2486xxx  and
mm-419447 using the f test indicated that their ic50 and ki
values were not statistically different (p . 0.05).
effect of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 on cgmp accumulation in human t84 cells. binding of  xxxd2486xxx  to
 xxxg1004xxx  receptors stimulates the intrinsic  xxxg1587xxx 
activity of the receptor, resulting in increased concentrations of
intracellular cgmp (busby et al., 2010). mm-419447 also
stimulates the accumulation of cgmp in human t84 cells in
a concentration-dependent manner with statistically equivalent potency. the concentration-response curves were used
to calculate the ec50 values for  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447:
112 6 21 and 103 6 26 nm, respectively. comparison of the
concentration-response curves of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447
using the f test indicated that the ec50 values were not
statistically different (p 5 0.7555). these results indicate that

ranged from 57.8â€“66.4% and 59.1â€“65% for mm-419447 and
 xxxd2486xxx , respectively, compared with 50.3% in vehicle-treated
rats (fig. 5). a side-by-side comparison of each dose of mm419447 and  xxxd2486xxx  using two-way analysis of variance
(anova) revealed that their dose-response curves were not
significantly different (p 5 0.6876), suggesting equal potency in
this model.  xxxd2486xxx  also significantly accelerated gi transit
in male cd rats (data not shown).

discussion
 xxxg1004xxx  is a receptor for the endogenous peptide hormones
 xxxg1001xxx  and  xxxg1002xxx  and is predominantly expressed on
the apical surface of epithelial cells of the small intestine and
colon (krause et al., 1994).  xxxd2486xxx  is an orally administered 14-amino acid peptide agonist of  xxxg1004xxx  which acts locally
within the lumen of the gi tract to exert its effects without
a need for systemic exposure.
the amino acid sequence and tertiary molecular structure
of  xxxd2486xxx  differ from those of  xxxg1001xxx  and  xxxg1002xxx .
these hormones contain four cysteines, as opposed to the six
within  xxxd2486xxx . these extra cysteines allow  xxxd2486xxx  to
form an additional intramolecular disulfide bond. this third
disulfide bond enhances the relative  xxxg1004xxx  agonist potency of
 xxxd2486xxx  by locking it into its active conformation, strengthening its binding affinity for  xxxg1004xxx  and increasing its stability
within the gi tract. however, the reinforced tertiary structure
of  xxxd2486xxx  does not prevent the proteolytic removal of its
c-terminal tyrosine, which is not protected by the disulfide
bonds, resulting in the formation of a 13-amino acid metabolite,
mm-419447 (des-tyr14), described here for the first time.
 xxxd2486xxx  is resistant to the harsh, acidic conditions of the
stomach, as shown by its stability in simulated gastric fluid.
under nonreducing conditions it is also resistant to proteolysis by gi hydrolases, with the exception of carboxypeptidase a. this enzyme removes the c-terminal tyr14 residue

assessed by measuring the volume of the luminal fluid content
90 minutes after the exposure of ligated duodenal, jejunal, and
ileal loops to either 5 mg of mm-419447 or vehicle. treatment
with mm-419447 stimulated a significant increase in fluid
secretion compared with vehicle-treated animals in loops from
all regions of the small intestine (fig. 4a). this increase in fluid
secretion after treatment with mm-419447 was accompanied by
a marked increase in the intraluminal concentration of cgmp
in the duodenum and jejunum, and a much less pronounced
increase in cgmp in ileal loops (fig. 4b). similar results for
increased fluid secretion and concomitant cgmp secretion in the
duodenum and jejunum were observed previously after treatment with  xxxd2486xxx  (busby et al., 2010). low concentrations of
cgmp accumulation in ileal loops injected with sta have been
reported by others (london et al., 1997; qian et al., 2000).
effects of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 on gastrointestinal transit in female rats. we measured the effects of orally administered mm-419447 and  xxxd2486xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner (6.25 to 50 mg/kg) in a rat gi transit
model. gi transit was determined by measuring the distance
a dose of activated charcoal, administered orally immediately
after mm-419447 or  xxxd2486xxx  dosing, traveled in the small
intestine after 10 minutes relative to the total length of the
small intestine. oral administration of mm-419447 or  xxxd2486xxx  resulted in a significant and dose-dependent acceleration of

of the parent peptide, leaving the three intramolecular
disulfide bonds and the tertiary structure necessary for
increased protease resistance,  xxxg1004xxx  binding, and potent
 xxxg1004xxx  agonist activity intact. the resulting peptide has been
confirmed as a circulating metabolite in high-dose pharmacokinetic experiments performed in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys (data not shown). the detection of mm-419447 in stool
samples from human subjects orally dosed with  xxxd2486xxx 
confirms that mm-419447 is also a human metabolite, although it has not been found in systemic circulation.
to determine whether this metabolite contributes to the
pharmacologic effects of  xxxd2486xxx , we synthesized mm-419447,
characterized its in vitro pharmacologic properties, and tested
it in rat models of gi function. mm-419447 exhibited in vitro
binding to t84 cell surface receptors similar to that of  xxxd2486xxx .
in addition, mm-419447 significantly increased intracellular cgmp concentrations in these cells in a concentrationdependent manner, with similar potency to that of  xxxd2486xxx .
these results are consistent with the hypothesis that mm419447, like  xxxd2486xxx , is a potent agonist of  xxxg1004xxx  and
provide further evidence that mm-419447 contributes to the
in vivo pharmacologic effects observed with  xxxd2486xxx .
the ability of mm-419447 to stimulate fluid secretion was
measured in vivo after injection into surgically ligated
duodenal, jejunal, and ileal loops in rats. fluid volume was
significantly increased in all three small intestinal regions.
this increased fluid secretion was associated with increased
luminal cgmp concentrations, suggesting that mm-419447
acts through stimulation of  xxxg1004xxx  receptors. the same pattern
and magnitude of biologic responses were observed with
 xxxd2486xxx  (busby et al., 2010). the pharmacologic effects of
orally administered mm-419447 on the rate of gi transit in

rats were administered either vehicle or increasing doses of mm-419447
or  xxxd2486xxx  by oral gavage, immediately before an oral dose of 10%
activated carbon/10% gum arabic powder suspension. after 10 minutes,
the rats were sacrificed, and the gastrointestinal transit was determined
as the percentage of the distance traveled by the charcoal front compared
with the total length of the intestine. all data are expressed as the mean 6
s.e.m. (n = 5-10 per group). *p , 0.05, **p , 0.01, ***p , 0.001 vs.

rats were also assessed, as altered intestinal transit correlates with clinical symptoms of ibs-c and cic (mayer et al.,
2008). mm-419447 showed a significant and dose-dependent
acceleration in the rate of gi transit in rats that was similar to
that seen for  xxxd2486xxx , further supporting the hypothesis
that mm-419447 is a potent agonist in vivo of  xxxg1004xxx  and
contributes to the local pharmacology of  xxxd2486xxx  within the
intestine.
recent evidence suggests a role for cgmp in mediating
 xxxd2486xxx â€™s effects on visceral pain (castro et al., 2012,
submitted for publication). like  xxxd2486xxx , mm-419447
stimulates cgmp production in the intestinal epithelium,
and therefore this active metabolite may contribute to the
analgesic effects observed after oral administration of
 xxxd2486xxx .
the disposition of  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 was also
assessed. pharmacokinetic (pk) studies in rats using orally
and intravenously dosed mm-419447 demonstrated that, as
with  xxxd2486xxx , mm-419447 is minimally absorbed and has
an absolute oral bioavailability of #0.1% in rats. after a 10mg/kg oral dose of  xxxd2486xxx , jugular and portal vein plasma
concentrations of both  xxxd2486xxx  and mm-419447 were low
(#6 ng/ml) in rats, indicating that both peptides are poorly
absorbed and hepatic exposure to them is minimal. minimal
systemic exposure to  xxxd2486xxx  was also observed in humans
in three phase 1 studies and was confirmed with sparse pk
sampling in four phase 3 trials. plasma concentrations of
 xxxd2486xxx  were typically not measurable and were always
below 1 ng/ml. mm-419447 was never quantifiable (lloq 5 2
ng/ml) and was therefore not confirmed as a circulating
metabolite in humans, although it was observed in human
stool samples. the minimal systemic availability of  xxxd2486xxx 
in humans is consistent with its low permeability coefficient
in caco-2 cells (data not shown) and the low absolute oral
bioavailability found in animals.
despite the fact that both active peptides are minimally
absorbed, the majority of dosed  xxxd2486xxx  is not excreted
in the feces. in rats, less than 1% of the orally delivered drug
was recovered in feces as  xxxd2486xxx  or mm-419447. of the
recovered peptide, .95% was in the form of the active
metabolite mm-419447. this confirms that the vast majority
of the drug is broken down within the intestine before
excretion. moreover, the results of a phase 1 study in humans
showed that a mean of 3â€“5% of the oral  xxxd2486xxx  dose was
excreted in the feces as a pharmacologically active peptide.
as was observed in rats, mm-419447 was the predominant
peptide detected. nevertheless, the presence of parent and
active metabolite in the feces demonstrates that some active
peptide is available to stimulate the  xxxg1004xxx  receptor throughout the small intestine and colon.
because  xxxd2486xxx  is minimally absorbed into systemic
circulation and the majority of the drug is not excreted either
as parent or active metabolite in the feces, the intestinal fate
of  xxxd2486xxx  is proteolytic digestion. using a series of in vitro
and in vivo experiments in rodents, as well as in human
biomaterials from cadavers, we have characterized this
degradation pathway. we observed rapid proteolysis of
 xxxd2486xxx  in the duodenum and jejunum of the rat and
a slower rate of disappearance in the distal small intestine
(ileum). the proteolytic metabolism was confirmed with
subsequent in vitro studies in which  xxxd2486xxx  was incubated
with intestinal fluid from mice, rats, and humans. in these

studies,  xxxd2486xxx  decreased immediately while mm-419447
began to form immediately.
the digestion of either  xxxd2486xxx  or mm-419447 requires
a process that first reduces their disulfide bonds. the
intestine is known to have the capacity to reduce disulfide
bonds in proteins and peptides (dahm and jones, 2000;
fernandes and holmgren, 2004; zahedi avval and holmgren,
2009). similar to our previous observations in rats, the
luminal contents of the human intestine were found to
contain high thiol concentrations (3â€“8 mm) and the components of the  xxxg905xxx  system, which has been shown to
reduce the three disulfide bonds of  xxxd2486xxx  (unpublished).
disulfide bond reduction leaves both  xxxd2486xxx  and mm419447 highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation, as
demonstrated by the rapid in vitro cleavage of reduced
 xxxd2486xxx  by proteolytic enzymes, including chymotrypsin.
the degradation pathway of  xxxd2486xxx  was further characterized by incubating it with diluted rat intestinal fluid to
slow down the digestion rate and allow intermediate peptide
degradation products to be trapped and identified. these
linearized peptide fragments contained three or more amino
acids. some of these peptide fragments were synthesized
and were found to have no  xxxg1004xxx  agonist activity. overnight
digestion of the synthesized fragments resulted in their
complete degradation, with quantitative recovery of internal amino acids. isolation and identification of similar
peptide intermediates after human intestinal fluid incubation when compared with those from rat intestinal fluid
incubations suggest that the metabolism and degradation
pathway of  xxxd2486xxx  in humans is the same as that in
the rat. figure 3 shows the intestinal fate of  xxxd2486xxx ,
beginning with its conversion to mm-419447, followed by
disulfide bond reduction, which inactivates both peptides.
intestinal hydrolases are then able to proteolytically degrade the linearized peptides to smaller peptides and amino
acids, which are subsequently recycled. individual amino
acids are absorbed through the intestine, as are peptides
consisting of two or three amino acids (daniel 2004; silk
et al., 1985), while hexa-, penta-, and tetrapeptides are
further digested by brush-border proteases before absorption (kim et al., 1972).
in conclusion, a more complete understanding of the
pharmacology and drug disposition of  xxxd2486xxx  now exists.
 xxxd2486xxx  is readily metabolized to an active metabolite,
mm-419447, which mirrors the parent in both pharmacologic
and pharmacokinetic properties. both peptides act locally in
the intestinal lumen with minimal absorption into systemic
circulation. under the conditions found in the intestine, both
active peptides are broken down in a process that requires
disulfide bond reduction, which enables proteolytic digestion
and results in a loss of pharmacologic activity. orally
administered  xxxd2486xxx  is confined primarily to the intestine,
the site of both pharmacologic activity and metabolic
clearance, thereby allowing  xxxd2486xxx  and its active metabolite to exert their pharmacologic effects while minimizing
systemic exposure to the peptides.
