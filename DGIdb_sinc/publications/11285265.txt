l-type ca2⫹ channels (ltccs)1 form a family of voltagegated ca2⫹ channels with high sensitivity to dihydropyridine
(dhp) ca2⫹ channel modulators. their ca2⫹-selective pore is
formed by different dhp-sensitive ␣1 subunit isoforms (␣1s,

␣1c, ␣1d, ␣1f) together with auxiliary subunits, including
␣2-␦ and ␤ subunits (1–3). whereas ␣1s and ␣1f expression is
restricted to skeletal muscle and the retina, respectively,
ltccs formed by ␣1c (c-ltccs) and ␣1d (d-ltccs) subunits
are widely expressed in neuronal and (neuro)endocrine cells as
well as in electrically excitable cells in the cardiovascular system (4 –9). in most cases, both channel types are even found in
the same cells, with d-ltccs usually being the much less
abundant isoform (7).
using d-ltcc-deficient mice, we have previously demonstrated that inward currents through ␣1d form ltccs with
biophysical and pharmacological properties distinct from cltccs (4, 6). these include a more negative range of current
activation and slower current inactivation during depolarizations, allowing these channels to mediate long lasting ca2⫹
influx during weak depolarizations. such properties allow
ltccs to control tonic neurotransmitter release in hair cells
(5, 10), diastolic depolarization in the sinoatrial node (11), and
electrical excitability of neurons (12–15).
in addition to these different biophysical properties, it has
also been postulated that d-ltccs may exhibit a lower sensitivity to dhp channel blockers (4, 16). however, this has never
been proven or quantified in a comparative study of the dhp
sensitivity of d- and c-ltccs. at present it is also unclear to
which extent these biophysical and pharmacological differences are determined by the ␣1d subunit itself, by known
accessory ca2⫹ channel subunits, or by other ca2⫹ channelassociated proteins.
by analyzing the biophysical and pharmacological properties
of cloned human ␣1d splice variants in tsa-201 cells, we provide evidence that most of the biophysical differences described
above are determined by ␣1d. we also demonstrate that alternative splicing of exon 8 is critically affecting the expression of
functional ␣1d protein in tsa-201 cells. our analysis also revealed that, in functional experiments, d-ltccs display lower
sensitivity for dhps than ␣1c, despite similar affinity for the
dhp binding pocket.

in cochlea inner hair cells (ihcs), l-type ca2ⴙ channels (ltccs) formed by ␣1d subunits (d-ltccs) possess
biophysical and pharmacological properties distinct
from those of ␣1c containing c-ltccs. we investigated
to which extent these differences are determined by ␣1d
itself by analyzing the biophysical and pharmacological
properties of cloned human ␣1d splice variants in tsa201 cells. variant ␣1d8a, containing exon 8a sequence in
repeat i, yielded ␣1d protein and l-type currents,
whereas no intact protein and currents were observed
after expression with exon 8b. in whole cell patch-clamp
recordings (charge carrier 15–20 mm ba2ⴙ), ␣1d8a - mediated currents activated at more negative voltages (activation threshold, ⴚ45.7 versus ⴚ31.5 mv, p < 0.05) and
more rapidly (␶act for maximal inward currents 0.8 versus 2.3 ms; p < 0.05) than currents mediated by rabbit
␣1c. inactivation during depolarizing pulses was slower
than for ␣1c (current inactivation after 5-s depolarizations by 90 versus 99%, p < 0.05) but faster than for
ltccs in ihcs. the sensitivity for the dihydropyridine
(dhp) l-type channel blocker isradipine was 8.5-fold
lower than for ␣1c. radioligand binding experiments
revealed that this was not due to a lower affinity for the
dhp binding pocket, suggesting that differences in the
voltage-dependence of dhp block account for decreased
sensitivity of d-ltccs. our experiments show that
␣1d8a subunits can form slowly inactivating ltccs activating at more negative voltages than ␣1c. these properties should allow d-ltccs to control physiological
processes, such as diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial
node cells, neurotransmitter release in ihcs and neuronal excitability.

vrev is the extrapolated reversal potential of iba, v is the membrane

slope factor of the boltzmann term. the time course of current activation was fitted using an exponential function.

i(t) is the current at time t after the depolarization, a0 is the steady

␶0, and c represents the remaining steady state current. the rate of
inactivation was assessed by both the percentage of current that had
inactivated after 2 s, and by fitting the current traces to the biexponen-

tial function, yielding time constants for a fast (␶fast) and a slow (␶slow)

voltage dependence of inactivation under quasi-steady state conditions
was measured using a multi step protocol to account for run-down. a
control test pulse (60 ms to the voltage of peak current, vmax) was
followed by a 2-s step to ⫺90 mv, followed by a 5-s conditioning step,
and a subsequent test pulse to vmax. the start-to-start interval was 20 s
at a holding potential of ⫺90 mv. inactivation during the 5-s conditioning pulse was calculated as follows.

iba,control and iba,test are the current amplitudes at vmax before and after

inactivation curves were fitted to a boltzmann equation as described
(25). effects of dhps were monitored continuously using 0.1-hz depolarizing pulses to vmax. dhps were dissolved in the external recording
solution from a 10 mm stock solution in  xxxd1896xxx  and perfused
through a microcapillary onto cells using a gravity-driven perfusion
system. only cells exhibiting stable currents (run down ⬍15% during
the first 60 s) were used for analysis of dhp effects. the dhps isradipine and bayk8644 were employed as their racemic mixtures.
transfected cells were visualized as cotransfected gfp fluorescence
ca2⫹ currents in ihcs were measured as previously described in cochleae isolated from 2– 4-day-old animals (4).
immunoblotting and preparation of affinity-purified sequence-directed antibodies was carried out as described (4, 26) using antibodies
described in the legend to fig. 1.

results

we cloned two different cdnas encoding full-length ␣1d
subunits (fig. 1a) from human pancreatic tissue, containing
alternatively spliced exons 8a or 8b (␣1d8a, ␣1d8b), which
results in a six-amino acid difference in the pore region of
repeat i. their sequence is identical to a previously cloned
cdna (9) but both splice variants lack exons 32 and 44. heterologous expression in tsa-201 cells together with auxiliary
subunits yielded dhp-sensitive l-type currents for ␣1d8a (100
of 154 patched gfp-expressing cells gave measurable iba) but
not for ␣1d8b. similarly, no current was measured under our
experimental conditions after transfection with rat ␣1d cdna
(18), which also contains exon 8b. to determine if the absence
of ca2⫹ current resulted in the expression of a non-functional
subunit or was due to the absence of ␣1d protein, ␣1d subunit
expression was quantified by immunoblot analysis of transfected tsa-201 cell membranes (fig. 1b). a  xxxg718xxx  of
␣1d protein was only detected for ␣1d8a but not for rat and
human ␣1d8b. after transfection of cells with ␣1d8b, ␣1d
immunoreactivity was only associated with polypeptides
smaller than the expected  xxxg718xxx  (fig. 1), suggesting
that ␣1d8b protein underlies proteolytic degradation in tsa201 cells. as a cloning artifact was ruled out by dna sequencing (see “experimental procedures”), our data suggest that the
six-amino acid residue difference prevents effective ␣1d ca2⫹
subunit expression in tsa-201 cells.
next we tested if ␣1d8a could give rise to l-type currents
with the characteristics described recently in chick and mouse
cochlea (4, 5, 16). these include low activation threshold, fast
activation kinetics, slow inactivation, and lower apparent dhp
antagonist sensitivity. after transfection using ca2⫹ phosphate precipitation, the ␣1d current density was similar to
␣1c-a mediated currents (table i). with 15 mm ba2⫹ as the
charge carrier, the threshold of activation for ␣1d8a was found
at about 15 mv more hyperpolarized potentials (⫺45.7 ⫾ 0.5

pbluescript sk⫹® (stratagene) or psport-1® (life technologies, inc.).
two f2 fragments containing different splice variants (8a and 8b; ref.
9) were obtained and used to construct ␣1d8a and ␣1d8b. the sequence
integrity of all fragments was determined by dna sequencing. the
complete ␣1d cdna was constructed by generating subclone f5/6 by
coligating the hindiii-xhoi* fragment (f5) and the xhoi*-bamhi*
fragment (f6) into pbluescript sk⫹. f1 and f2 fragments were coligated into the corresponding sali/sphi re sites of the plasmid containing fragment f3/4. the resulting sali*-hindiii fragment (f1– 4) was
ligated into the sali/hindiii restriction sites of subclone f5/6. for
heterologous expression studies, the ␣1d cdna was cloned into the
mammalian expression plasmids pgfp⫺ and pgfp⫹ (17). cloning into
pgfp⫹ generates a fusion protein of ␣1d with n-terminally located
green fluorescent protein (gfp).
transient expression of ␣1d splice variants in tsa-201 cells—tsa201 cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/
coon’s f-12 medium (life technologies, inc.) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal calf serum (sebak), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml
penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °c and 7% co2. for transient ca2⫹ channel expression, cells were grown to 80% confluence and plated at
dilutions of 1:10 on glass coverslips 12 h before transfection by lipofection (using n-[1-(2,3-dioleoy(oxy)propyl]n,n,n-trimethylammoniummeshyl-sulfate, or fugene-6; roche molecular biochemicals) or ca2⫹
phosphate precipitation using standard protocols. human ␣1d, rat ␣1d
(cloned into expression plasmid pcmv6b; ref. 18), or rabbit ␣1c-a (19)
subunits were expressed together with ␣2␦ (20), bovine (21), or rat ␤2a
(22) or rat ␤3 subunits (23). the cells were incubated at 30 °c and 5%
co2 12 h after transfection for 2–5 days prior to recording or membrane
preparation.
membrane preparation and (⫹)-[3h]isradipine binding—membranes from tsa-201 cells transfected with 4.5 ␮g of ␣1, 3.5 ␮g of ␣2-␦,
2.5 ␮g of ␤1a or ␤3 subunit, and 4.5 ␮g of puc18 carrier dna in 10-cm
culture dishes were prepared as described (24). binding experiments
with (⫹)-[3h]isradipine were performed in a final assay volumes of 0.5
or 1 ml (24). experimental details are given in the legend to fig. 5.
kinetic experiments were performed in the absence of added ca2⫹.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 ␮m unlabeled
isradipine. serial dilutions of drugs were made in me2so (final me2so
concentration ⬍ 1% (v/v)).
electrophysiological recordings—whole cell patch clamp experiments were carried out at room temperature using an axopatch 200b
amplifier (axon instruments, foster city, ca). currents were recorded
at sampling rates of 5 or 25 khz, low pass-filtered at 2 or 5 khz, and
recorded directly onto a personal computer equipped with pclamp
version 7.0. borosilicate glass pipettes had a resistance of 2– 4 megohms
when filled with internal solution. capacitance and series resistance
compensations of 60 – 80% were used. the voltage error due to uncompensated series resistance was 1.2 ⫾ 0.6 mv. the average membrane
time constant was 83 ⫾ 6 ␮s. unless stated otherwise, ba2⫹ currents
(iba) through ltccs were measured with the following solutions: pipette solution (in mm): 135 mm cscl, 10 mm cs-egta, and 1 mm mgcl2,
adjusted to ph 7.4 with csoh; bath solution (in mm): 15–20 mm bacl2,
10 hepes, 150 mm choline cl, and 1 mm mgcl2, adjusted to ph 7.4 with
csoh. run-down of iba was typically less than 10% in 3 min. all
voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of ⫺10 mv. leak
and capacitative currents were measured using hyperpolarizing pulses.
raw currents were corrected for linear leak currents. the voltagedependence of activation was determined from iv curves obtained by
step depolarizations from a holding potential of ⫺90 mv to various test
potentials. iv curves were fitted according to equation 1.

tionship (vmax) as well as the potential of half-maximal iba
activation (v0.5,act) was also shifted significantly to hyperpolarized potentials without affecting the slope of the activation
curve (table i). depolarizations to vmax revealed that iba
through ␣1d8a showed a monoexponential activation time
course about 3-fold faster than for ␣1c-mediated currents (table i, fig. 2b). as for ␣1c-a, the speed of ␣1d8a activation
increased at more positive voltages. more rapid activation of
␣1d8a was consistently found over a voltage range from ⫺30 to
⫹30 mv (fig. 2c).
to test if ␣1d8a also mediates the slowly inactivating l-type
currents observed in ihcs, we compared current inactivation
during long test pulses with the inactivation time course of
(largely ␣1d-mediated; ref. 4) l-type currents in ihcs and
heterologously expressed ␣1c. during a 5-s depolarizing test
pulse from a holding potential of ⫺90 mv to vmax, 90 ⫾ 2.2%
(n ⫽ 6) of ␣1d8a current inactivated (fig. 3a). in contrast, only
9.3 ⫾ 4.6% (n ⫽ 6) of iba inactivated during a 5-s depolarizing
pulse in ihcs. although inactivation of ␣1d8a current was
faster than in ihcs, it was significantly slower than for ␣1c-a
(99 ⫾ 1.3%, n ⫽ 4, p ⬍ 0.05; fig. 3, a and b). fig. 3a shows
normalized currents of ␣1c-a and ␣1d8a, which both exhibit
biexponential inactivation. slower inactivation of ␣1d8a was
due to a 1.5-fold increase of the time constant for the slowly
inactivating component (fig. 3b) (␣1d8a: ␶slow ⫽ 1.7 ⫾ 0.2 s,
n ⫽ 6; ␣1c-a: ␶slow ⫽ 1.1 ⫾ 0.2 s, n ⫽ 4) and a decrease in the
relative contribution of the fast component (␣1d8a: 45 ⫾ 3%,

␶fast ⫽ 0.187 ⫾ 0.015 s; ␣1c: 60 ⫾ 6%, ␶fast ⫽ 0.145 ⫾ 0.022 s;
n ⫽ 4 – 6).
␤2a subunits stabilize slow inactivation of ca2⫹ channel ␣1
subunits (21, 27). we therefore investigated if the slower inactivation time course of ␣1d currents of ihcs can be obtained by
coexpression with rat or bovine ␤2a subunits (together with
␣2␦ subunits). as shown in fig. 3c, current inactivation during
2-s depolarizing test pulses was slower upon coexpression of rat
or bovine ␤2a than upon coexpression with ␤3 but could not
account for the slow inactivation of ␣1d in ihcs.
steady-state inactivation of iba was compared after coexpression of ␤3 subunits with 15 mm ba2⫹ as the charge carrier.
the midpoint voltage of the steady-state inactivation curve for
␣1d8a was about 10 mv more negative (⫺42.7 ⫾ 1.6 mv, n ⫽
6) compared with ␣1c-a (⫺27.6 ⫾ 2.7 mv, n ⫽ 4) (fig. 3d). note
that inactivation of ␣1d was not complete during the 5-s conditioning prepulses.
the more negative activation threshold (␣1d8a: ⫺37.2 ⫾
0.98, n ⫽ 13; ␣1c-a: ⫺27.6 ⫾ 1.3, n ⫽ 16) was also observed
when 15 mm ca2⫹ were used as the charge carrier. ␣1d8a
showed pronounced ca2⫹-induced inactivation kinetics. during
test pulses to vmax, about 70% of ica inactivated within less
than 400 ms (n ⫽ 6). inactivation of ␣1d8a current was slower
and less complete than ␣1c-a (data not shown).
previous experiments suggested that the dhp antagonist
sensitivity may be lower for d- than for c-ltccs. however,
this has never been proven by a systematic comparison of dhp

antagonist effects on ␣1d and ␣1c-a currents under identical
experimental conditions. we therefore measured the inhibition
of both channel types by the dhp antagonist isradipine at
various concentrations and at different holding potentials. at
⫺90 mv holding potential, 300 nm isradipine completely inhibited ␣1c-a current (98.3 ⫾ 1.7%, n ⫽ 3) but only 30 – 40% of
␣1d8a (fig. 4). the concentration dependence of block revealed
that isradipine sensitivity for ␣1d8a was 8.5-fold lower (fig.
4b) at this holding potential. isradipine sensitivity increased
by an order of magnitude at a more positive holding potential
(⫺50 mv, fig. 4b), demonstrating a voltage-dependent mechanism of dhp block as described previously for ␣1c-a currents
(28, 29).
to determine if this sensitivity difference was due to a lower
affinity of isradipine for ␣1d8a, its affinity for the dhp binding
pocket was determined in membranes prepared from transfected cells in radioligand binding experiments with (⫹)-[3h]isradipine (fig. 5). under identical experimental conditions,
similar affinities were measured for ␣1d8a (kd ⫽ 0.42 ⫾ 0.06
nm, n ⫽ 10) and ␣1c-a (kd ⫽ 0.68 ⫾ 0.12 nm, n ⫽ 8) (fig. 5a).
therefore, different affinities for the dhp drug binding pocket
cannot account for the lower sensitivity observed in our functional studies. dissociation of bound (⫹)-[3h]isradipine occurred about 8-fold faster from ␣1d8a (k⫺1 ⫽ 32.6 ⫾ 4.8 ⫻ 10⫺3
min⫺1, n ⫽ 3) than from ␣1c-a (k⫺1 ⫽ 4.2 ⫾ 0.1 ⫻ 10⫺3 min⫺1,

affinity, binding kinetics differ between the two ␣1 subunit
isoforms.

201 cells also exhibited the typical current modulation by the
ca2⫹ channel activator bayk8644 (fig. 4, c and d) similar to
its actions in ihcs (4). bayk8644 increased the maximal iba,
produced a slight hyperpolarizing shift in the iv relationship
and slowed current deactivation of the tail current induced by

discussion

here we present the first detailed patch clamp analysis of
the biophysical properties of whole cell currents through ca2⫹
channels formed by ␣1d subunits after heterologous expression
in mammalian cells. our studies revealed that these subunits
can form l-type ca2⫹ channels with properties similar to dltccs previously described in ihcs (4). we clearly demonstrate lower dhp antagonist sensitivity, more rapid activation
kinetics, and slower inactivation for the ␣1d8a splice variant as
compared with ␣1c-a currents. another novel finding was that
the lower dhp antagonist sensitivity is not due to lower binding affinity for the dhp binding pocket. instead, it is only

increasing concentrations of (⫹)-[3h]isradipine were incubated (37 °c, 120 min) with membrane protein (␣1d, 33 ␮g/ml; ␣1c, 23 ␮g/ml) prepared
from tsa-201 cells transfected with ␣1d or ␣1c-a together with ␣2-␦ ⫹ ␤ dnas. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 ␮m
isradipine. specific binding data were fitted to a monophasic saturation isotherm yielding the following binding parameters: ␣1d8a, kd ⫽ 334 pm
and bmax ⫽ 1.72 pmol/mg; ␣1c, kd ⫽ 503 pm and bmax ⫽ 1.11 pmol/mg. b, dissociation experiments. membrane protein from cells expressing ␣1d
(25 ␮g/ml) or ␣1c-a (25 ␮g/ml) were incubated with 0.19 nm (⫹)-[3h]isradipine until equilibrium (b0) was reached. dissociation was induced by
rapid addition of a final concentration of 1 ␮m unlabeled isradipine. a semilogarithmic representation of the time-dependent decay of specific

for ␣1c, 4.3 ⫻ 10⫺3 ⫻ min⫺1).

evident in the presence of membrane potential and therefore
must involve a voltage-dependent mechanism affecting dhp
antagonist sensitivity in functional studies. we were also able
to demonstrate that the heterologous expression of ␣1d in
mammalian cells is critically affected by six amino acids in the
pore region of repeat i.
our previous experiments with mice lacking class d ca2⫹
channels clearly revealed that ␣1d subunits are required to
form low voltage-activated ltccs with the above described
properties in mouse cochlear ihcs. however, from these experiments it remained unclear if all of these properties are inherent to ␣1d or require the presence of a yet unidentified ca2⫹
channel subunit.
heterologous expression of ␣1d8a together with ␣2␦ and ␤3
(or ␤2a) resulted in iba with an activation threshold below ⫺40

mv (15–20 mm ba2⫹ as charge carrier) and thus are very
similar to the activation range observed in the presence of 10
mm ba2⫹ in ihcs (⫺40 to ⫺50 mv, ref. 4). the activation
threshold for ␣1d8a-mediated currents can be estimated to be
about ⫺60 mv at physiological ca2⫹ concentrations (4). the
activation time constants were significantly faster than for
␣1c-a at most voltages and at positive voltages (20 – 40 mv :
␶act ⫽ 0.44 – 0.56 ms; fig. 2c) close to the value obtained in
ihcs (0.31 ms; ref. 4). very similar values were also measured
for v0.5,act (␣1d8a: ⫺17.5 mv; ihc: ⫺16.5 mv) and vmax
(␣1d8a: ⫺5.5 mv; ihc: ⫺2.1 mv; ref. 4). interestingly, alternative splicing has been observed in transmembrane segment
s3 and the adjacent s3-s4 linker in repeat iv. this region
affects the voltage-dependence of activation in voltage-gated
ca2⫹ (30), na⫹ (31), and k⫹ (32) channels. it is therefore

(36) has not yet been reported. further studies must determine
which of the 6 amino acids differing between these alternative
exons account for this effect. it is possible that alternative
splicing in is6 serves as a molecular switch to modulate ␣1d
subunit expression on the post-transcriptional level.
our experiments provide convincing evidence that ␣1d8amediated l-type currents activate at slightly more positive
voltages than recombinant t-type channels (37) but at more
negative voltages than c-ltccs as reported here. in this respect they resemble ␣1e-mediated currents (37), which were
originally classified as low voltage-activated (38). although we
cannot exclude that alternative splicing or biochemical modulation (e.g. phosphorylation) also allows other l-type ␣1 subunit isoforms (including ␣1c) to activate at such “intermediate”
voltages, our data provide direct evidence that d-ltccs can
account for the “low voltage-activated” l-type currents described previously in neurons (15). we have developed mutant
mice in which the dhp sensitivity of ␣1c-subunits is dramatically reduced (39). such animal models will allow direct determination of the role of d-ltccs for l-type current components
in various tissues.
taken together, the evidence demonstrates that expression
of ␣1d subunits should enable cells to slowly inactivating voltage-gated ca2⫹ influx in response to rather weak depolarizations. this property allows them to participate in important
physiological functions such as tonic neurotransmitter release
in ihcs (10) and control of diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial
node (4). these properties also make them ideally suited to
contribute to subthreshold ca2⫹ signaling (e.g. in hippocampal
pyramidal cells; ref. 14) and to the plateau potential underlying bistable membrane behavior (e.g. in motoneurons; refs. 12
and 13).

possible that alternative splicing in this region also affects the
activation threshold of ␣1d. in contrast to our constructs, a
previously cloned human ␣1d (9) contains exon 32 (and exon
44). unfortunately, its biophysical and pharmacological properties have not been directly compared with ␣1c under identical experimental conditions. stable expression of this cdna in
hek-293 cells (together with ␤3 and ␣2␦, 20 mm ba2⫹ as
charge carrier) yielded channel currents with v0.5,act of ⫹1.8
mv and a vmax of about ⫹20 mv (33). however, correction for
junction potential would shift these values to more negative
potentials by about 23 mv, resulting in activation parameters
nearly identical to our ␣1d8a subunit. minor effects of exon 32
on channel gating cannot be ruled out and will require a more
detailed analysis.
the only property not mimicked by our splice variant was the
very slow inactivation of ihc currents during a depolarizing
pulse. ␣1d8a currents inactivate slower than ␣1c-a but faster
than iba in ihcs. as compared with ␣1c-a, the slower inactivation of ␣1d8a can be explained by an increase of the contribution and the time constant of a slow component of iba
inactivation. it remains to be determined if alternative splicing
or the presence of another auxiliary subunit is responsible for
the slow inactivation of class d currents in ihcs.
the relatively weak channel block of iba through class d
ltccs by dhp antagonists was now directly confirmed in our
experiments. we describe for the first time that dhp inhibition
of ␣1d is voltage-dependent and favored at more positive voltages. as for ␣1c-a, this indicates higher affinity for inactivated
channels (28, 29) or induction of inactivated channel states
(25). ␣1d8a showed an approximately 10-fold lower sensitivity
for block by the dhp antagonist isradipine than ␣1c-a. this
finding nicely explains the absence of major side effects expected from block of class d channels in humans at therapeutic
plasma concentrations. this includes the lack of bradycardic
actions expected from the block of class d channels in sinoatrial
node cells as well as the absence of hearing disturbances resulting from the block of this channel type in cochlear ihcs (4).
instead, dhps preferentially block class c ltccs in the cardiovascular system (34). the higher dhp sensitivity of the
smooth muscle ␣1c splice variant (␣1c-b) as compared to the
cardiac splice variant (␣1c-a; ref. 28) in part explains the
selectivity of dhps for arterial smooth muscle, resulting in
therapeutic antihypertensive effects in the absence of cardiodepression (34). the higher sensitivity of ␣1c-b is also not due to
a higher affinity of dhp antagonists for its dhp binding pocket
(28). instead, it could be explained by differences in the voltage
dependence of ␣1c block and is due to amino acid divergence
between the two splice variants in transmembrane segment
is6. we propose that a similar mechanism must explain the
lower dhp antagonist sensitivity of ␣1d8a as compared with
␣1c-a because the affinity for the dhp binding pocket is the
same in these subunits.
although we and others (9) found evidence for alternative
splicing in segment is6 (exons 8a and 8b, respectively), the
role of exon 8b for ␣1d function and dhp modulation could not
be assessed. this was due to the absence of intact ␣1d protein
and currents after expression of our human ␣1d construct in
which exon 8a sequence was exchanged for exon 8b (␣1d8b).
the inhibitory role of exon 8b on ␣1d expression is further
supported by our inability to transiently express full-length rat
␣1d, which also contains exon 8b, despite the abundant presence of mrna in the transfected cells.2 in accordance with our
interpretation, the functional expression of exon 8b containing
␣1d cdnas isolated from rat brain (35) and chicken cochlea
