inhibiting the hepatic cytochrome p450 metabolic pathway, but whether it has direct effects on cardiac
ion channels has not been elucidated.
2 to determine the mechanism underlying these clinical findings, we investigated the effect of
 xxxd2640xxx  on human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) k þ channels.

with an ic50 of 2.1 mm (n ¼ 3–5 cells at each concentration, hill coefficient 1.2). herg block was not
frequency-dependent. it required channel activation, occurred rapidly, and had very slow dissociation
properties.
5 the activation curve was shifted in a negative direction (v1/2: 9.572.3 mv in controls and
15.372.4 mv after 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx , po0.05, n ¼ 6).  xxxd2640xxx  did not change other channel
kinetics (activation, deactivation, onset of inactivation, recovery from inactivation, steady-state
inactivation).
6 the s6 domain mutation, f656c, abolished the inhibitory action of  xxxd2640xxx  on herg current
indicating that  xxxd2640xxx  preferentially binds to an aromatic amino-acid residue within the pore-s6
region.
7 our findings indicate that  xxxd2640xxx  causes herg channel block by binding to a common drug
receptor, and this involves preferential binding to activated channels. thus,  xxxd2640xxx  prolongs the
qt interval by direct inhibition of herg channels.

introduction
 xxxd2640xxx  is a widely prescribed imidazole antifungal drug
available in topical, vaginal and parenteral formulas. azole
antifungals (e.g. fluconazole, ketoconazole) are associated with
the acquired long qt syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias
(moss, 1999; tonini et al., 1999; wassmann et al., 1999;
dorsey & biblo, 2000; tamargo, 2000). since azole antifungals
inhibit multiple cytochrome p450 enzymes in the liver and
gastrointestinal tract, the mechanism of arrhythmogenesis is
considered to be a rise in the plasma concentration of
qt-interval prolonging drugs (e.g., class iii antiarrhythmic
drugs, some h1-receptor antagonists and antibiotics) that

use the same metabolic pathway (albengres et al., 1998;
venkatakrishnan et al., 2000; roden, 2001). however, ventricular arrhythmia can occur in the absence of other qt-interval
prolonging drugs (coley & crain, 1997; wassmann et al.,
1999), suggesting that azole antifungal drugs may have direct
effects on the heart. in fact, ketoconazole has been reported to
directly block human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg or
 xxxg1246xxx ) encoded k þ channels (dumaine et al., 1998).
although  xxxd2640xxx  is known to inhibit multiple cytochrome
p450 enzymes (venkatakrishnan et al., 2000; zhang et al.,
2002), it is not known whether  xxxd2640xxx  exerts direct effects
on herg channels.
in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells, the principal
repolarising currents activated during the action potential
plateau are the rapidly (ikr) and slowly (iks) activating
components of the delayed rectifier k þ current (sanguinetti
& jurkiewicz, 1990; carmeliet, 1993), with ikr encoded by

k. kikuchi et al

herg (curran et al., 1995; sanguinetti et al., 1995; trudeau
et al., 1995). in addition to class iii antiarrhythmic drugs, a
remarkable array of structurally diverse therapeutic agents
that cause acquired long qt syndrome block herg or ikr
channels (viskin, 1999; drici & barhanin, 2000; witchel &
hancox, 2000). one possible explanation for this is that these
drugs bind to a common drug receptor within the pore of
herg channels. using alanine scanning mutagenesis of the
pore-s6 region of herg channel, aromatic amino-acid
residues (y652 and particularly f656) were reported to be
key determinants of drug binding to herg channels
(mitcheson et al., 2000a).
the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of
 xxxd2640xxx  on herg k þ channels heterologously expressed in
a human cell line. we found that  xxxd2640xxx  potently inhibited
herg k þ current by preferential binding to activated channels
with ultra-slow dissociation kinetics and that the binding
required a common drug receptor within the pore-s6 region.

methods
dna constructs and transfection of hek293 cells
herg cdna was subcloned into bamhi/ecori sites of
the pcdna3 vector (invitrogen, san diego, ca, u.s.a.).
herg wild-type channels were stably expressed in a human
embryonic kidney (hek293) cell line as described previously
(zhou et al., 1998). the herg f656c (phenylalanine to
cysteine at position 656) mutation was generated by sitedirected mutagenesis of wild-type herg cdna with the use
of the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene,
la jolla, ca, u.s.a.), and the integrity of the construct was
verified by dna sequencing. hek293 cells were transfected
with this construct using the lipofectamine method (invitrogen). stably transfected cells generated through  xxxg418xxx  antibiotic selection were subcloned to achieve a uniform herg
expression level. the cells were cultured in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (d-mem: life technologies,
gaithersburg, md, u.s.a.) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 u ml1 penicillin and 100 mg streptomycin.
for electrophysiological analysis, cells were harvested from
the culture dish by trypsinisation, washed with d-mem, and
stored in this medium at room temperature for later use. cells
in culture dishes were easily detached by trypsinisation and
studied within 8 h of harvest.

electrophysiological recordings
herg channel current was recorded using the whole-cell
patch-clamp technique. transfected cells were transferred to
a bath mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope
(diaphot, nikon, japan). the bath was perfused with 4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulphonic acid (hepes)buffered tyrode solution containing (in mm) 137 nacl, 4
kcl, 1.8 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 10 glucose, and 10 hepes (ph 7.4).
the volume of the bath was 0.6 ml and the external solution
in the bath was almost completely exchanged within 1 min at a
perfusion rate of 1.25 ml min1. the internal pipette solution
contained (in mm) 130 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 5 ethylene glycol bis
(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n0 ,n0 -tetraacetic acid (egta),
5 mg-atp, and 10 hepes (ph 7.2). electrodes were

constructed from borosilicate glass using a micropipette puller
(p-87, sutter instrument co., novato, u.s.a.) and heatpolished with a microforge (mf-83, narishige, tokyo). the
final resistance of the electrode was 3–5 mo when filled with
the pipette solution. membrane currents were recorded with an
axopatch 200b amplifier (axon instruments, union city,
u.s.a.) and digitised at 2–10 khz with an analogue-to-digital
converter (digidata 1200b; axon instruments). computer
software (pclamp ver. 8.1, axon instruments) was used
to generate voltage clamp protocols, acquire data and analyse
current traces. all experiments were performed at room
temperature (23711c).

chemicals
 xxxd2640xxx  was kindly provided by the mochida pharmaceutical co. (tokyo) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide
(dmso) to prepare a stock solution (40 mm). final drug
concentrations were prepared by diluting stock solution with
tyrode solution. the highest concentration of dmso used
in this study was 0.1%. in preliminary experiments, herg
tail current amplitudes expressed in hek293 cells were not
significantly changed after 3 min of dmso application at
0.1% (n ¼ 4).

statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean7s.e.m. where applicable,
n represents the number of cells studied. statistical significance
was analysed using a two-tailed student’s t-test (paired or
unpaired). p-values o0.05 were considered statistically significant. curve fitting was performed using multiple nonlinear
least-squares regression analysis (pclamp ver. 8.1, axon
instruments or sigma plot ver. 7.0, spss science, chicago,
il, u.s.a.).

results
 xxxd2640xxx  inhibits herg channels expressed
in hek293 cells
the effect of  xxxd2640xxx  on the herg current–voltage (i–v)
relationship is shown in figure 1. herg current was elicited
from a holding potential of 80 mv by 4-s long depolarising
steps to between 70 and 60 mv applied in 10 mv increments
every 15 s. tail current was recorded with a step to 50 mv
for 6 s. representative currents recorded in control conditions
and 3 min after application of  xxxd2640xxx  (4 mm) in the same cell
are shown in figure 1a.  xxxd2640xxx  reduced herg current
amplitude during the depolarising step as well as tail current.
the averaged normalised i–v relationships for herg current
measured at the end of the depolarising steps and for peak tail
current are shown in figure 1b and c, respectively. control
herg current during the depolarising steps was maximal at
about 0–10 mv, with tail current fully activated following steps
to 10–20 mv.  xxxd2640xxx  (4 mm) reduced the steady-state
current amplitude to 25.271.9% (n ¼ 6) of control  xxxd1891xxx  mv,
and tail current peak amplitude to 27.872.4% (n ¼ 6) of
control at 20 mv, respectively. voltage-dependence of activation was also evaluated by plotting normalised tail current as a
function of voltage. data were fitted with a boltzmann

slope factor, respectively. in this protocol, the half-activation
voltage was significantly shifted in a negative direction from
9.572.3 mv in controls to 15.372.4 mv after  xxxd2640xxx 
(po0.05, n ¼ 6) and the slope factor was significantly
decreased from 8.770.7 in controls to 6.970.4 after  xxxd2640xxx  (po0.05, n ¼ 6).
figure 2a shows the effects of  xxxd2640xxx  (40 mm) on the
herg current during a drug wash-in protocol. herg
current was elicited from a holding potential of 80 mv by a
4-s depolarising step to 20 mv followed by a repolarising step
to 50 mv for 6 s, and the protocol was applied every 15 s.
after obtaining the control record,  xxxd2640xxx  was applied to
the bath. herg channel block occurred rapidly to reach a
steady-state level within 1–2 min (figure 2b). the blocking
effect on herg channels was not reversed during washout of
up to 10 min.
the concentration–response relationship of  xxxd2640xxx 
block was assessed by changes in the amplitude of herg
current measured at the end of depolarising step to 20 mv and
the peak tail current after attaining steady-state drug block.
only a single drug concentration was tested on each cell.
 xxxd2640xxx  reduced herg current in a concentrationdependent manner (figure 2c). the ic50 value and hill
coefficient for herg current measured at the end of
depolarising step to 20 mv were 2.2 mm and 1.0, respectively,
and for tail current peak amplitude were 2.1 mm and 1.2,
respectively.

information on the molecular basis of  xxxd2640xxx  binding
to herg channels, we investigated the effects of  xxxd2640xxx 
on herg f656c mutant channels. the affinity of  xxxd2640xxx 
to herg wild-type and mutant channels was compared by
measuring the effects of  xxxd2640xxx  at 40 mm (figure 2d).
voltage protocols were applied as described in figure 2a to
record currents under control and after application of
 xxxd2640xxx . in wild-type herg channels, the tail current
peak amplitudes were reduced to 5.070.3% (n ¼ 3) of the
control current amplitude (figure 2c). the inhibitory effect of
 xxxd2640xxx  on herg current was almost completely abolished in the f656c mutant channels. the mean relative peak
amplitude of the tail current measured after 3 min of
 xxxd2640xxx  application yielded 98.270.6% (n ¼ 7) of the
control current amplitude.

state-dependence of herg channel block by  xxxd2640xxx 
to determine the state-dependence (closed, open and inactivated) of channel block, we used a protocol modified from
kiehn et al. (1996) and thomas et al. (2001). from a holding
potential of 80 mv, the cell was first depolarised to 80 mv for
100 ms to maximally activate channels from the closed state,
and then the cell was repolarised to 0 mv for 300 ms to allow
for maximal channel recovery from inactivated to the open
state (see figure 1). the cell was then either held at 0 mv
(protocol 1) or a second step to 80 mv was applied for 300 ms
to increase channel inactivation before step-back to 0 mv
(protocol 2; figure 3a). this approach of employing steps to
very positive potentials was designed to determine whether
maximal drug block occurred when channels were predominantly in the inactivated or open states. figure 3a shows
example control records with these protocols. with protocol 2
there was less current during the 300-ms long step to 80 mv
because of increased channel inactivation, whereas following
step-back to 0 mv, the current with both protocols was similar.
figure 3b shows the effect of  xxxd2640xxx  (4 mm). for this
experiment, cells were held continuously at 80 mv for 3 min
during drug wash-in to keep the channels in the closed state.
the data show that after drug wash-in, with the initial
depolarisation a large amplitude herg current was present
consistent with minimal drug binding to the closed state, and
this was followed by a decline in herg current as drug block
developed (‘first pulse block’). the time-dependent decline in
herg current amplitude at 0 mv exhibited a single exponential process (dashed line). the 300-ms long step to 80 mv
(protocol 2) interrupted this exponential time course and the
current amplitude at the beginning of the second step to 0 mv
exceeded the extrapolated predicted current amplitude by
7.971.3% (n ¼ 5). the maximum current amplitude at the
second step to 0 mv and the extrapolated predicted current
amplitude at the same time point were 6917184
and 6457177 pa, respectively (n ¼ 5). the difference
was statistically significant by the paired t-test (po0.01).
these results suggest that blockade by  xxxd2640xxx  is weaker
when the herg channels are predominantly in the inactivated
state. thus, the block of herg current by 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx 
requires channel activation from the closed state, and block is
greater using protocols that maximise availability of open
channels.
we examined in greater detail the possibility of closed state
block. using the protocol shown in figure 3b, currents for

exceeded the extrapolated predicted current. (c and d) the initial
current amplitude was not reduced by 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx  but was

control conditions and with first pulse block with 4 or 12 mm
 xxxd2640xxx  (figure 3c and d, respectively) were superimposed
for the initial step to 80 mv and the following step to 0 mv.
with 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx , the initial current during the step to
80 mv was not different from the control current, and with the
step to 0 mv block gradually developed, suggesting minimal
closed state block (figure 3c). when the drug concentration
was increased to 12 mm (figure 3d), a small reduction in the
british journal of pharmacology vol 144 (6)

844

k. kikuchi et al

current amplitude was observed at the initial phase of the
depolarisation step to 80 mv and there was greater block with
the step to 0 mv, suggesting minor closed state block.
however, the rapid development of open-channel blockade
was not excluded, because drug binding might be accelerated
at higher drug concentration. the peak current amplitudes
evaluated at the initial 80 mv step-pulse were decreased by
5.472.9% (n ¼ 5) and 25.477.8% (n ¼ 3) after application of
4 and 12 mm  xxxd2640xxx , respectively (po0.05). these results
suggest that  xxxd2640xxx  is predominantly an activated state
blocker with higher affinity for the open state, and lowest
affinity for the closed state.

frequency dependence of herg current block
the frequency dependence of herg current block was
investigated by applying 30 repetitive pulses (see inset,
figure 4) at 0.2 and 1 hz, after holding the cell at 80 mv
for 3 min during wash-in of 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx . herg current
was first rapidly activated by a 100 ms step to 80 mv, which
was followed by a 400 ms step to 20 mv. as block of herg
current develops quickly after channel activation (see figure 3),
herg current was measured as the maximum outward
current amplitude during the step pulse at 20 mv, and was
normalised to the control current measured prior to drug
exposure. for control conditions, the herg current amplitude during the pulse train decreased only slightly (o4%).
following exposure to 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx , application of the

figure 4 inhibition of herg tail current by  xxxd2640xxx  is not
frequency-dependent. after the cell was held at 80 mv for 3 min
during exposure to 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx , 30 repetitive pulses (see inset)
were applied at 1 and 0.2 hz. herg current amplitude measured as
peak value during step to 20 mv for each pulse was normalised by
the control peak current amplitude, and then plotted against the
pulse number. for control conditions, there was little effect of the
pulse train applied at 0.2 or 1 hz (n ¼ 5), whereas in the presence of
 xxxd2640xxx , herg current was reduced similarly at 0.2 and 1.0 hz
pulse frequencies. solid lines represent fits with double exponential
function: af exp(t/tf) þ as exp(t/ts) þ base, where t is pulse
number; tf and ts are time constants of fast and slow components;
af and as are fractional amplitudes of fast and slow components.
fitting parameters were tf 1.1670.12, ts 75.3737.1 at 1 hz (n ¼ 5)
and tf 1.2470.15, ts 64.7717.8 at 0.2 hz (n ¼ 5).

british journal of pharmacology vol 144 (6)

 xxxd2640xxx  blocks cardiac herg channels

pulse train at either 0.2 or 1.0 hz decreased current amplitude
by 50.375.8% (n ¼ 5) at 0.2 hz and by 51.172.4% (n ¼ 5) at
1 hz. the time constants of the fast and slow components of
the time course of block were not significantly different
between the 0.2 and 1.0 hz frequencies (n ¼ 5 cells at each
pulsing rate). thus, neither the development of block nor the
amount of steady-state block was frequency-dependent.

effects of  xxxd2640xxx  on kinetics of channel gating
drug block of ion channels often exerts apparent effects
on channel kinetics. using voltage clamp protocols identical
to those of zhou et al. (1998), we measured activation,
deactivation, inactivation and recovery from inactivation.
after obtaining the control record, step pulses as illustrated
in figure 2a were applied in the presence of 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx 
for 3 min and then herg current was recorded with identical
protocols. to evaluate the time course of herg channel
activation, the cell was clamped to 20 mv from a holding
potential of –80 mv for varying durations followed by a
repolarising step to –50 mv to elicit tail current. the time
constant obtained by fit to the envelope of tail currents was
used for evaluation of the herg current activation (figure 5a
and b). the time constants for activation did not significantly
change after application of 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx  (152716 ms in
control vs 141717 ms after  xxxd2640xxx , n ¼ 8). deactivation
current was elicited by 10 mv step pulses from –100 mv to
–20 ms after a 1-s depolarisation pulse to 60 mv from a holding
potential of –80 mv (figure 5c). deactivation time constants
were obtained by fit with double exponential function to the
decay phase of tail current. the two time constants describing
current decay were not significantly changed by 4 mm
 xxxd2640xxx  (n ¼ 5, figure 5d).
to test the effects of  xxxd2640xxx  on recovery from
inactivation, the cells were depolarised to 60 mv for 200 ms
to rapidly inactivate herg channels and then repolarised to
between –100 and –20 mv to elicit tail currents (figure 6a).
the rising phase of the tail current represents the rapid
recovery of herg channels from inactivated to open states.
after fitting a double exponential function to the tail current
trace at each potential, the time constant for the rising phase
was used to measure recovery from inactivation. there was no
significant difference before and after 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx 
application (n ¼ 5, figure 6c).
we also studied the effects on the onset of inactivation with
4 mm  xxxd2640xxx . the cells were depolarised to 60 mv for
200 ms to promote inactivation and hyperpolarised to
100 mv for 10 ms, which is a sufficient time for recovery
from inactivation as indicated in figure 6c without significantly deactivating the channels (figure 6b). then, channels
that recovered were forced to reinactivate at potentials
between –20 and 60 mv. the time constant of inactivation
was measured by fitting a single exponential function to the
decaying current trace. the onset of inactivation was
accelerated at strongly depolarised potentials (50 and
60 mv), but there were no significant differences between
control and drug application in wide range of voltages (n ¼ 5,
figure 6c). thus,  xxxd2640xxx  has little effect on the rates of
inactivation and recovery from inactivation of herg
channels.
steady-state inactivation was measured using a double-pulse
protocol with varying interpulse repolarisation levels

k. kikuchi et al

(figure 6d). after the first 200 ms pulse to 60 mv promoting
inactivation, 10 ms interpulses were applied to potentials
between –100 and 20 mv, followed by a second step to

60 mv. peak currents measured 3 ms after the onset of the
second step to 60 mv were plotted as a function of the
proceeding repolarising potential and then fitted with a
boltzmann function: i ¼ imax  [1exp(vv1/2)/k]1, where
i is current amplitude, imax is maximum amplitude, v1/2 and
k are half-inactivation voltage and the slope factor, respectively. data from six cells under control and 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx 
were normalised to the asymptotic values of their respective
boltzmann fits (figure 6e). the half-inactivation voltage
and slope factor obtained by fit with boltzmann equation
were 64.872.2 mv and 17.271.3 in controls (n ¼ 6),
and 65.571.4 mv and 17.271.7 after 4 mm  xxxd2640xxx 
(n ¼ 6), respectively. both parameters were not statistically
different. thus,  xxxd2640xxx  does not exert specific effects on
channel inactivation. otherwise unbinding upon repolarisation, which allows channels to become available for opening,
does not occur because of the slow unbinding of  xxxd2640xxx 
from the channels and unchanged kinetics might reflect the
kinetics of  xxxd2640xxx  unbounded channels.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that the azole antifungal drug
 xxxd2640xxx  potently inhibited herg current heterologously
expressed in a human cell line. as with most drugs, the block
was state-dependent. under our experimental conditions,
closed (rested) state block was minimal and was noted only
at high drug concentrations. in contrast, herg channel block
by  xxxd2640xxx  required channel activation, and the greatest
block appeared to be with the open state of the channel. as
shown in figure 3, evidence to support preferential open state
block was derived from experiments showing a reduction in
drug block at voltages (80 mv) where the occupancy of the
inactivated state was greatest. nevertheless, the experiments
could not clearly distinguish between open or inactivated state
block.
when trains of depolarising steps were applied,  xxxd2640xxx 
caused a progressive decrease in current, as expected for a drug
with state-dependent block. the time course of development of
block and the amount of steady-state block were not
significantly different between 1.0 and 0.2 hz (figure 4). this
lack of frequency-dependence can be accounted for by a very
slow dissociation of the drug from the channel. with
sufficiently slow drug dissociation the longer recovery interval
between pulses at slower rates does not cause appreciable
additional recovery over the time scale studied in our
experiments. the negligible current recovery after drug

washout also supports the notion of very slow channel
dissociation of this drug. the pattern of activated state block
and slow dissociation is consistent with an activation gate
trapping mechanism, as also reported for other herg
channel blocking drugs such as the methanesulphonanilide
compounds (carmeliet, 1992; mitcheson et al., 2000b).
the structural basis of herg channel block by several
chemically unrelated compounds have recently been studied
in detail. aromatic amino-acid residues, particularly f656,
located in the s6 transmembrane domain of herg channels
were proposed to be the most important molecular determinants of drug binding to herg channels (lees-miller et al.,
2000; mitcheson et al., 2000a; kamiya et al., 2001; sanchezbritish journal of pharmacology vol 144 (6)

chapula et al., 2002; scholz et al., 2003; thomas et al., 2004).
in the present study, f656c mutant channels markedly
attenuated herg current inhibition by  xxxd2640xxx . the
result clearly shows that  xxxd2640xxx  predominantly binds to a
drug receptor within the pore-s6 region.
it is of interest to compare our findings with  xxxd2640xxx  to
previous findings with ketoconazole (dumaine et al., 1998).
ketoconazole was reported to block herg channels predominantly by binding to the closed state of herg channels
to cause tonic block, with lower affinity binding to the open
state. in addition, herg current block by ketoconazole was
reversible upon drug washout. our data show that block of
herg channels by  xxxd2640xxx  required channel activation

k. kikuchi et al

from the closed state, and the drug block was not easily
reversed by drug washout. thus,  xxxd2640xxx  appears to
act like most drugs previously studied on herg channels
and ikr, where they bind preferentially to the channel following
its activation from the closed state. the ic50 values for
block of herg tail current peak amplitude also differed
(49 mm in ketoconazole (dumaine et al., 1998), and 2.1 mm in
 xxxd2640xxx ). these differences may be attributed in part to
differences in the expression systems used (xenopus oocytes
versus hek293 cells), experimental conditions, and channel
kinetics.

clinical implications of herg channel blockade
by  xxxd2640xxx  and limitations of the study
although  xxxd2640xxx  is associated with cardiac arrhythmias,
the underlying mechanism(s) remains speculative. since
 xxxd2640xxx  is known to inhibit multiple cytochrome p450
enzymes in the liver and gastrointestinal tract (zhang et al.,
2002), warnings have been issued against the concomitant
administration of  xxxd2640xxx  with qt interval-prolonging
drugs that use the same metabolic pathway (albengres et al.,
1998; venkatakrishnan et al., 2000; roden, 2001). the present
study demonstrates that  xxxd2640xxx  also directly inhibits
herg channels. the maximal therapeutic concentrations of
 xxxd2640xxx  in patients ranges from 0.96 to 3.5 mg ml1 when
administrated intravenously, corresponding to 2.3–8.4 mm.
since the plasma protein binding for  xxxd2640xxx  is reported
to be approximately 90% (stevens et al., 1976), the ic50 values
determined in the present study may exceed slightly the
expected free-drug concentration range in plasma. thus, the
apparent low incidence of qt prolongation by  xxxd2640xxx 
might in part be accounted for by its high protein binding.

 xxxd2640xxx  blocks cardiac herg channels

847

nonetheless, our findings provide a direct cellular mechanism
for  xxxd2640xxx -induced qt interval prolongation and cardiac
arrhythmias. direct inhibition of the herg current may be of
greater concern when  xxxd2640xxx  is used in patients with
congenital long qt syndrome, in patients with electrolyte
abnormalities such as hypokalemia, or in patients receiving
other qt interval prolonging drugs whether acting directly
through herg channel block or inhibition of drug metabolism through the p450 system.
the present study has certain limitations. we used herg
channels heterologously expressed in a human cell line. the
possible effects of  xxxd2640xxx  on other ion channels as well as
receptors in vivo cannot be excluded. secondly, mink-related
peptide 1 (mirp1), encoded by kcne2, coassembles with the
pore-forming herg subunit and probably reconstitutes
native ikr (abbott et al., 1999). compared to channels formed
by the herg subunit alone, herg/mirp1 complexes show
altered channel properties and increase the potency of channel
block by e-4031. moreover, the mutant forms of mirp1
demonstrated diminished potassium currents or increased
channel blockade by drugs (sesti et al., 2000). therefore, it is
possible that  xxxd2640xxx  sensitivity might be different between
herg and herg/mirp1 channels, although wild-type
mirp1 does not markedly influence the drug sensitivity of
the channels (numaguchi et al., 2000; kamiya et al., 2001;
scherer et al., 2002; friederich et al., 2004).
