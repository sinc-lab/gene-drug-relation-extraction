to better define the mechanism of action of the thiazolidinediones, we incubated freshly isolated human
adipocytes with rosiglitazone and investigated the
changes in mrna expression of genes encoding key
proteins of adipose tissue functions. rosiglitazone
(10 26 m, 4 h) increased p85aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85api-3k) and uncoupling protein-2 mrna levels and decreased leptin expression. the mrna levels
of  xxxg1194xxx ,  xxxg1198xxx , glut 4,  xxxg1337xxx ,
 xxxg1330xxx , acylation-stimulating protein, fatty acid transport protein-1,  xxxg99xxx ,
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and  xxxg1807xxx  and g2
were not modified by rosiglitazone treatment. activation of rxr, the partner of  xxxg1807xxx , in the presence of
rosiglitazone, increased further p85api-3k and  xxxg2375xxx 
mrna levels and produced a significant augmentation
of glut 4 expression. because p85api-3k is a major
component of insulin action, the induction of its expression might explain, at least in part, the insulinsensitizing effect of the thiazolidinediones. © 1999

also increase insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues
as demonstrated in type-2 diabetic patients treated
with troglitazone (1, 3). although their mechanism of
action is not entirely understood, it is well recognized
that thiazolidinediones are high-affinity ligands of the
peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor g ( xxxg1807xxx ),
a member of the nuclear receptor family (4), also identified as  xxxg1807xxx  in the new nuclear receptor nomenclature (5). the relative potency of different thiazolidinediones to bind and to activate  xxxg1807xxx  in vitro
correlates with their antidiabetic action in vivo (6, 7),
indicating thus that  xxxg1807xxx  mediates the insulin sensitizing effect of these molecules.  xxxg1807xxx  is predominantly expressed in differentiated adipocytes (8 –10)
suggesting that adipose tissue might be one of the
main target tissues of the thiazolidinediones. there are
three  xxxg1807xxx  mrnas (g1, g2 and g3) giving rise to two
proteins (g1, g2) (11) and that are generated from the
same gene by alternative promoter usage and mrna
splicing (12, 13). the two proteins differ in their 28
n-terminus amino acids in humans (13). in subcutaneous adipose tissue and isolated adipocytes,  xxxg1807xxx 
mrna represents more than 80% of the  xxxg1807xxx  transcripts (10).
 xxxg1807xxx  plays a major role in adipocyte differentiation (14, 15). nevertheless, the high level of expression
in mature adipocytes (9, 10) indicates that  xxxg1807xxx  is
also involved in the control of the metabolic functions
of the fully differentiated adipocytes. accordingly, most
of the known  xxxg1807xxx  target genes encode adipose tissue proteins involved in lipid storage and metabolism,
like, for example, adipose  xxxg934xxx 
(16),  xxxg1337xxx  (17) or fatty acid transport
protein-1 (18, 19).  xxxg1807xxx  is a nuclear receptor that
heterodimerizes with the 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  receptor
(rxr) (20) to control the transcription of target genes.
the peroxisome proliferator responsive elements
(ppres) generally consist of a hexameric nucleotide

direct repeat spaced by one nucleotide (dr-1) (21). the
demonstration that a gene is a target of the ppars
requires thus the identification of a functional ppre in
its promoter sequence. to date, only a few number of
genes have been really identified as target genes of
 xxxg1807xxx  (16, 17, 19, 21, 22). nevertheless, valuable indications can be also obtained by studying the changes
in the expression level of specific genes upon activation
of  xxxg1807xxx  by thiazolidinediones. using such approach,
several other putative target genes have been reported,
mainly on the basis of investigations in rodents or in
cell lines (17, 23–30). moreover, because activation of
 xxxg1807xxx  promotes important modifications of the metabolism of the animals as well as of cell functions
and differentiation, it might be difficult to ascertain
whether the observed changes in gene expression result from a direct transcriptional effect of  xxxg1807xxx  or
represent secondary events of thiazolidinedione treatment (30). to overcome such problems, it may be possible to use fully differentiated cells. to date, only a
limited number of studies have been performed in human mature adipocytes (31–33).
in this work, we examined whether genes encoding
important proteins of adipose tissue functions and metabolism are possible targets of  xxxg1807xxx  in human adipocytes. isolated mature adipocytes and short incubation periods were used to limit possible effects due to
 xxxg1807xxx -induced cell differentiation. the cells were incubated with rosiglitazone (brl 49653), a potent
 xxxg1807xxx -selective thiazolidinedione (4), and we measured the rapid changes in the expression levels of 13
candidate genes using specific reverse transcriptioncompetitive polymerase chain reaction (rt-cpcr)
mrna assays.

preparation of human isolated adipocytes. abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (8 6 2 g wet weight, n 5 24) was obtained
during surgery with the informed consent of the patients, in agreement with the ethic committee of the hospices civils of lyon
(france). none of the subjects suffered from severe systemic illness,
diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia. their age ranged from 33 to 77
years (mean 6 sd 5 59 6 11 years) and their body mass indexes
(bmi) from 21 to 61 (mean 6 sd 5 31 6 8 kg/m 2). eighteen subjects
(11 women, 7 men) were obese (mean age: 57 6 9 years, mean bmi:
33 6 8 kg/m 2. the six lean subjects (4 women, 2 men) were 71 6 6
years old and had a bmi of 23 6 1.3 kg/m 2. the adipose tissue sample
was immediately immersed in hanks medium kept at 4°c and cell
preparation was started within 15 min after tissue sampling. adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion (0.5 mg/ml; type ii,
sigma, la verpillère, france) according to the method of rodbell (35)
with the modifications previously described (36). isolated adipocytes
were incubated at 37°c in dmem (life technologies, cergy pontoise, france) containing 4% fatty acid free bovine  xxxg124xxx  in
a final volume of 1 ml. the average cell number in the incubation

medium varied from 50,000 to 150,000 cells per milliliter. cells were
incubated 30 min at 37°c prior to the addition of the different agents
or vehicle (0.1%  xxxd1896xxx ). the viability and the metabolic
integrity of the cells prepared and incubated under these conditions
have been verified (36). after 4 h of incubation, infranatant was
removed by aspiration and cells were immediately lysed in the denaturating buffer from the rneasy kit (qiagen, courtaboeuf,
france) and stored at 280°c.
total rna preparation and quantification of the target mrnas.
total rna was prepared using the rneasy total rna kit from
qiagen. total rna concentration was determined by absorbance
measurement at 260 nm. the 260/280 nm absorption ratio of all
preparation was between 1.8 and 2.0. the average yield of total rna
was about 1 mg/100,000 cells.
the mrna levels of 13 different candidate genes were determined
by rt-cpcr. the method consists, after specific reverse transcription reactions, in the co-amplification of the target cdnas with
known amounts of a specific competitor dna in the same tube (37).
the construction of the different competitor dna, the sequences of
the primers and the validation of the different rt-cpcr assays have
been reported elsewhere (10, 37–39). the coefficient of variation of
the different assays was demonstrated to be between 5 and 15% (37).
the rt-cpcrs and the analysis of the pcr products were performed
in the conditions previously indicated (10, 37, 39).
presentation of the results. the results were presented either as
absolute mrna levels, in amol/mg of total rna, or as percentage of

was used for statistical analysis. p , 0.05 was the threshold of
significance.

results
the mrna levels of 13 different genes encoding proteins involved in insulin signaling, lipid metabolism
and adipocyte functions were quantified by rt-cpcr in
human isolated adipose cells. under the control condition, the expression levels of the target mrnas displayed large differences.  xxxg1337xxx  (lpl,
2371 6 308 amol/mg total rna, n 5 5 obese subjects)
and hormone sensitive lipase (hsl, 574 6 106, n 5 5
obese subjects) mrnas were expressed at the higher
levels.  xxxg1194xxx  (60 6 14, n 5 4 lean subjects),
 xxxg1194xxx  substrate-1 ( xxxg1198xxx , 18 6 6, n 5 4 lean
subjects), acylation stimulating protein (asp, 16 6 6,
n 5 3 obese subjects) and uncoupling protein-2 (ucp-2,
9 6 2, n 5 5 obese subjects) mrna were expressed at
intermediary levels. plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(pai-1, 3.9 6 0.8, n 5 3 obese subjects), fatty acid
transport protein-1 (fatp-1, 1.5 6 0.4, n 5 5 obese
subjects) and  xxxg99xxx  (0.16 6 0.05, n 5 3 obese
subjects) were expressed at very low levels. the mrna
levels of p85a regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85api-3k), leptin, the insulin-dependent
glucose transporter (glut 4) and  xxxg1807xxx  were measured in 10 preparations of adipocytes from lean and
obese subjects, and are presented in table i. a significant higher expression of leptin mrna was observed
in isolated adipocytes from obese subjects when compared to cells from lean individuals. on the opposite,

glut 4 mrna levels were higher in adipocytes from
lean subjects. there was no differences in the basal
mrna levels of p85api-3k and  xxxg1807xxx  between adipocyte preparations from lean and obese subjects
(table i).
figure 1 shows the percentages of change in the
mrna levels of the 13 target genes after 4 h of treatment with 10 26 m rosiglitazone. for the  xxxg1807xxx  gene,
effects on both total  xxxg1807xxx  (g1 1 g2) and  xxxg1807xxx 
mrna levels are presented (fig. 1). regarding the
mrnas encoding proteins involved in the insulin signaling pathway, rosiglitazone did not affect the expression levels of  xxxg1194xxx  and  xxxg1198xxx  while it promoted a significant increase (p 5 0.03, n 5 10) in the
mrna levels of p85api-3k. this effect of rosiglitazone
was similarly found in adipocytes from lean and from
obese subjects (table i).
after 4 h of incubation, rosiglitazone did not affect
the mrna expression levels of the insulin-dependent
glucose transporter glut 4 in human adipocytes (fig. 1
and table i). similarly, the mrna levels of lpl, hsl,
asp, and fatp-1, were not modified during incubation
with rosiglitazone in cells from obese subjects (fig. 1).
the expression of pai-1 and  xxxg99xxx  has
been recently documented in human adipose tissue.
our results indicate that the mrna expression levels
of these two components of the regulation of blood flow
and vascular functions were not acutely modified by
rosiglitazone in adipocytes from obese subjects (fig. 1).
regulation of leptin and ucp-2 mrna expression by
thiazolidinediones has been already reported in adipose cells. the present study confirmed these results in
freshly isolated human adipocytes. rosiglitazone promoted a slight (45%) but significant (p 5 0.03, n 5 5)
increase in ucp-2 mrna levels in cells isolated from
obese subjects (fig. 1). on another hand, rosiglitazone
decreased leptin mrna abundance by more than 30%
(p 5 0.03, n 5 10). leptin mrna levels measured in

cells from obese subjects were twice the levels found in
adipocytes from lean subjects, but rosiglitazone reduced leptin mrna expression to a similar extent in
both groups (table i).
thiazolidinediones and rosiglitazone are high affinity ligands for the nuclear receptor  xxxg1807xxx . it was
therefore of interest to determine whether  xxxg1807xxx  can
auto-regulates its expression. figure 1 and table i
clearly show that rosiglitazone did not modify the
mrna levels of  xxxg1807xxx  (g1 1 g2) after 4 h of incubation in human adipocytes from both lean and obese
subjects. incubation with troglitazone (10 26 m, 6 h),
another thiazolidinedione, also did not affect  xxxg1807xxx 
mrna levels (data not shown). in human adipocytes,
 xxxg1807xxx  represented about 15% of the total  xxxg1807xxx 
transcripts (3.5 6 1.1 amol/mg total rna, n 5 3). the
mrna levels of  xxxg1807xxx  were also not modified by
rosiglitazone in 3 preparations from obese subjects
(fig. 1).
to verify whether the observed effects of rosiglitazone were mediated by the heterodimer  xxxg1807xxx /rxr,
we investigated the effect of a combination of rosiglitazone and  xxxd330xxx , a specific agonist of rxr, on the
mrna levels of p85api-3k, ucp-2 and leptin that
were significantly changed by rosiglitazone alone, and
of glut 4, fatp-1 and  xxxg1807xxx  because these 3 genes
have been previously suspected to be targets of the
thiazolidinediones. figure 2 shows the percentages of
change in the mrna levels of these 6 genes after 4 h of
incubation with 10 26 m rosiglitazone and 10 26 m lg
1069. the treatment with the two molecules increased
p85api-3k mrna levels (116 6 24%, n 5 5) to an
extent that seemed more important than with rosiglitazone alone (82 6 18%, n 5 5), but the difference did
not reach significance (p 5 0.225). on another hand,
the combination of rosiglitazone and  xxxd330xxx  clearly
improved the increase in ucp-2 mrna levels induced
by rosiglitazone alone (85 6 25% vs 44 6 12%, p 5 0.04,

posed to explain their in vivo insulin sensitizing effect
(see 40 for review). activation of  xxxg1807xxx  by thiazolidinediones in adipose tissue may increase the production of small adipocytes that are more sensitive to
insulin. thiazolidinedione can also decrease the production and/or the biological activity of “adipocytokines” (i.e.,  xxxg2296xxx -a, leptin) that are
suspected to induce insulin resistance, and finally, they
can reduce circulating lipid and fatty acid concentrations by increasing their clearance by adipocytes.
these hypotheses are mainly based on data obtained
using animal models. moreover, most of the human
target genes of  xxxg1807xxx  are not yet known, limiting thus
the understanding of the exact mechanism of action of
these drugs.
the aim of this work was to verify whether some
important genes involved in insulin action, lipid metabolism and adipocyte functions are target genes of
 xxxg1807xxx  and rosiglitazone, a potent thiazolidinedione,
in human adipocytes. because  xxxg1807xxx  is highly expressed in adipose cells, we made the assumption that
changes in the expression levels of putative target
genes should be seen after only few hours of incubation. in addition, short incubation periods and the use
of freshly isolated mature adipocytes should limit possible changes in gene expression that were secondary
to  xxxg1807xxx  (or rosiglitazone)-induced modifications of

n 5 5). moreover, glut 4 mrna levels were significantly increased in the presence of the two agents
(54 6 14%, p 5 0.03, n 5 6) whereas rosiglitazone alone
did not modified glut 4 expression in human adipocytes (fig. 1 and table i). the effect of rosiglitazone
and  xxxd330xxx  on leptin mrna levels was similar to
what was observed with rosiglitazone alone. finally,
the combination of the two agents did not modify the
mrna levels of  xxxg1807xxx  and fatp-1 (fig. 2).
discussion
thiazolidinediones are potential new pharmacological agents for the treatment of insulin resistance in
type-2 diabetes mellitus (1, 3). although they can bind
and activate the nuclear receptor  xxxg1807xxx  (4, 6, 7), the
precise mechanism of action of these drugs is still
largely debated. several possibilities have been pro-

cell functions and differentiation. we found that activation of  xxxg1807xxx  by rosiglitazone increased the mrna
levels of the p85a subunit of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (p85api-3k) and of the uncoupling protein-2
( xxxg2375xxx ) genes. in addition, rosiglitazone decreased leptin mrna levels in human adipocytes. the mrna
levels of  xxxg1194xxx ,  xxxg1198xxx , glut 4, lpl, hsl,
asp, fatp-1,  xxxg99xxx , pai-1, and  xxxg1807xxx 
and g2 were not modified after 4 h of incubation with
rosiglitazone. the concomitant activation of rxr, the
partner of  xxxg1807xxx  to form a transcriptionally active
heterodimer, further increased the mrna levels of
p85api-3k and  xxxg2375xxx  and produced a significant augmentation in glut 4 mrna abundance.
 xxxg2375xxx  has been already reported to be target genes of
 xxxg1807xxx  and the thiazolidinediones in different adipose
cell models (29), including human adipocytes (33). as
in the present work, a moderate, but significant, increase in  xxxg2375xxx  mrna levels has been observed after
24 h of incubation of human adipose tissue with rosiglitazone (33). the amplified effect of rosiglitazone in
the presence of  xxxd330xxx  strongly suggest that  xxxg2375xxx  is
a target gene of the heterodimer  xxxg1807xxx /rxr. identification of an efficient ppre in the promoter region of
the human gene will be the next step to confirm this
assumption.
reduction in leptin gene expression by thiazolidinediones has been largely documented both in vivo
and in vitro (23, 24, 32). our results are in accordance
with these data and extend them to freshly isolated
human adipocytes. on another hand, lpl and fatp-1
have been demonstrated to be target genes of  xxxg1807xxx  in
rodent adipocytes and ppres have been identified in
their promoter regions (17, 19). surprisingly, we found
that the mrna levels of these two genes were not
affected by rosiglitazone after 4 h of treatment in human mature adipocytes. a lack of modification of lpl
mrna levels during rosiglitazone treatment has been
already observed in differentiated adipose cell lines
(41). in addition, we found that activation of rxr did
not improve the effect of rosiglitazone on fatp-1
mrna levels. these results may suggest that speciesrelated differences can exist in the regulation of these
genes by  xxxg1807xxx . alternatively, longer incubations
might be required to obtain an effect, suggesting that
the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone on fatp-1
and lpl gene can be different from the mechanism
involved in the rapid responses of p85api-3k and
 xxxg2375xxx  mrnas. for example, recruitment of additional
partners or cofactors might be needed.
in human adipocytes, rosiglitazone did not modify
the mrna levels of asp, hsl,  xxxg99xxx  and
pai-1, suggesting that they are not targets of  xxxg1807xxx .
regarding the regulation of pai-1 expression by thiazolidinediones and  xxxg1807xxx  in endothelial cells, contradictory data have been recently reported (42, 43). ad-

ipose tissue is also a possible source of pai-1 in vivo
and its expression is increased in obesity (44). however, it seems from our work that pai-1 gene is not
acutely regulated by  xxxg1807xxx  in human adipocytes.
conflicting data have been reported regarding the
effect of  xxxg1807xxx  activation on the expression of its own
gene. some authors have observed a decreased expression of  xxxg1807xxx  in cultured adipose cells treated with
rosiglitazone (26, 27) whereas others have found an
increased expression in rat adipose tissue in vivo (28)
and in human muscle cells in culture (45). in human
mature isolated adipocytes, we did not observed any
effect of rosiglitazone without or with activator of rxr
on the mrna levels of  xxxg1807xxx . the incubation of the
cells for 6 h with different concentrations (10 210 to 10 26
m) (data not shown) or the use of troglitazone, another
thiazolidinedione, did not change the result. it seemed
therefore that thiazolidinediones do not rapidly affect
 xxxg1807xxx  gene expression in human mature adipocytes.
in adipose cell lines, thiazolidinediones increased
the expression of the glucose transporter glut 4 and
enhanced insulin stimulated glucose uptake (46). in
vivo also, treatment of insulin resistant zucker fa/fa
rats with pioglitazone (30) or ob/ob mice with rosiglitazone (47) increase adipose tissue expression of glut
4, suggesting that glut 4 may be a target gene of
 xxxg1807xxx . our data showed that glut 4 expression is not
modified by treatment of human adipocytes by rosiglitazone alone. however, the combination of rosiglitazone and  xxxd330xxx  significantly increased glut 4 mrna
levels. these results suggested that glut 4 may be a
target gene of the heterodimer  xxxg1807xxx /rxr in human
adipocytes. reduced expression of glut 4 has been
demonstrated in adipose tissue from insulin resistant
obese and type-2 diabetic patients (48). in accordance,
we found lower mrna levels of glut 4 in isolated cells
from obese subjects. thus, increased expression of glut
4 and enhanced glucose transport rate in adipocytes
may participate in the improvement of insulin sensitivity during thiazolidinedione therapy.
we also investigated the regulation by rosiglitazone
of genes coding 3 major actors of the insulin signaling
cascade, namely  xxxg1194xxx ,  xxxg1198xxx  and p85api3k.  xxxg1194xxx  and  xxxg1198xxx  mrna levels were not
affected by the treatment of isolated adipocytes, suggesting that these genes are not acutely regulated by
 xxxg1807xxx . on another hand, the mrna levels of
p85api-3k were significantly increased by rosiglitazone. the p85api-3k is an adaptor protein that
links the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase to upstream signaling molecules (such as  xxxg1198xxx ), playing thus a major role in the intracellular action
of insulin (49). therefore, the rapid induction of
p85api-3k expression in response to rosiglitazone may
have important consequences in the insulin response of
the cells. we have now demonstrated that in addition

269

to the mrna, the protein level of p85api-3k is significantly increased by rosiglitazone and that the antilipolytic response to insulin is markedly improved in
human isolated adipocytes (rieusset et al. manuscript
in preparation). several studies in rodents had already
suggested that thiazolidinediones affect the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway of insulin action (50 –
52). our data in human adipocytes indicate that among
the different components of this signaling cascade, the
gene encoding the p85api-3k may be the molecular
target of the thiazolidinediones.
activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway is required for a variety of insulin effects, including the regulation of glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis and the antilipolytic action of insulin (49).
furthermore, altered expression and activation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have been reported in
subjects with type-2 diabetes or obesity (51–53). therefore, the identification of p85api-3k as a possible target gene of the thiazolidinediones shed new light on the
understanding of the insulin sensitizing action of these
molecules and their beneficial effect in the treatment of
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
