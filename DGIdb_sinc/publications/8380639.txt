5-htd10/p receptors. primers 3.17 and 5.5 [(5'-tggaattctgygyiathkcictggaymgsta-3') and (5'-catiaviriiariggdatrwaraaigc-3')] were used to amplify
5 ,ug of poly(a)+ rna from rat brain that was reversetranscribed by reverse transcriptase (avian myeloblastosis
virus). pcr was done on single-stranded cdna as follows:
940c for 1 min, 500c for 2 min, and 72tc for 3 min for 40
cycles. after pcr, 90 a.l of the reaction was phenol/
chloroform-extracted and precipitated, treated with t4 dna
polymerase, and digested with ecori before separation on a
1% agarose gel. the dna fragment was isolated from the gel,
kinased, and cloned into pbluescript. recombinant clones
were analyzed by sequencing. one clone, designated s51,
was chosen for further study.
cloning and sequencing. a human lymphocyte genomic
library (stratagene) was screened by using the rat s51 fragment as a probe. the probe was labeled with 32p by the
method of random priming (18) and hybridized (19). for
subcloning and further southern blot analysis, dna was
inserted into puc18 (pharmacia). nucleotide sequence analysis was done by the sanger dideoxynucleotide chaintermination method (20) on denatured double-stranded plasmid templates with sequenase (united states biochemical).
expression. the coding region of clone hl16a was cloned
into vector pcexv-3 (21), and stable cell lines were obtained
by cotransfection (19). one lm(tk-) cell line, l-1f-3, was
selected for binding studies; one nih 3t3 stable cell line
n-1f-6 was selected for functional studies.
membrane preparation. membranes were prepared from
stably transfected lm(tk-) cells as described (19). protein
concentrations were determined by the method of bradford
(22).
radioligand-binding studies. [3h]5-ht-(20-30 ci/mmol;
new england nuclear; 1 ci = 37 gbq) binding was done as
described (7). competition experiments were done by using
10-12 concentrations of drug and 4.5-5.5 nm [3h]5-ht.
nonspecific binding was defined by 10 a.m 5-ht. binding
data were analyzed by nonlinear-regression analysis (7). ic50
values were converted to ki values using the cheng-prusoff
equation (23). all experiments were done in triplicate.
adenylate cyclase activity. adenylate cyclase activity was
determined in initial experiments in lm(tk-) cells, as described (14). a weak inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase (fsac) (25-30%o) was obtained. stable cell

human serotonin (5-1t) 5-htificee receptor subtype was isolated from a human genomic library with probes obtained from
degenerate pcr primers used to amplify 5-lit-receptorspecific sequences. the highest degree of homology was found
with the  xxxg1111xxx  subtype (70%) and the 5-htlda (63%) and
5-htldp3 (60%) receptors. rna for this gene was detected in
the human brain but was not detected in kidney, liver, spleen,
heart, pancreas, and testes. high-affinity (kd = 9.2 nm)
3h-labeled 5-ht binding was detected. competition studies
revealed the following rank order of potencies for serotonergic
ligands: 5-ht > sumatriptan >> 5-carboxyamidotryptamine
> 8-hydroxy-2(di-1-propylamino)tetralin > spiperone. 5-ht
produced a dose-dependent inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stlmulated
camp accumulation (ec50 = 7.9 nm) in transfected cells.
these properties distinguish this receptor from any previously
characterized and establish a fifth 5-ht1.15&. receptor subtype
( xxxg1112xxx ) coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase.

the diverse physiological actions of serotonin (5-ht) are
mediated by at least four receptor classes: 5-htlike, 5-ht2,
5-ht3, and  xxxg1117xxx  (1-3). the 5-ht1like class appears the most
heterogeneous. four human genes encoding 5-ht1.like receptors have been cloned: 5-ht1a (4, 5), 5-htda (6, 7),  xxxg1110xxx ,
(7-9), and  xxxg1111xxx  (10-12). the  xxxg1109xxx  has been
cloned (13-15) and is homologous to the 5-ht1dp receptor
(14). these 5-ht1like receptors all share an amino acid
homology of at least 50o, high affinity for 3h-labeled 5-ht
([3h]5-ht), and coupling to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity as a primary coupling pathway. many additional 5-ht-mediated functional responses do not seem to
correlate with any of these cloned receptor subtypes (16, 17).
we have used a pcr cloning approach to isolate a human
gene that encodes another 5-ht1-lke, receptor, termed  xxxg1112xxx ,
with a pharmacological profile distinct from any serotonergic receptor yet described.t like the other 5-htl ike receptors,  xxxg1112xxx  couples to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase
activity, and this response is blocked by methiothepin. detection of the mrna encoding this receptor in the human brain
indicates that binding studies using [3h]5-ht as a ligand
require reevaluation. furthermore, the high affinity of the
 xxxd2022xxx  drug sumatriptan at this subtype indicates a
possible role of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor in migraine.

experimental procedures
pcr. the third (iii) and fifth (v) transmembrane (tm)
domains of the following receptors were used to synthesize
degenerate primers: 5-ht1a,  xxxg1115xxx , 5-ht2, and the

abbreviations: tm, transmembrane; 5-ct, 5-carboxyamidotryptamine; 5-ht, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine); [3h]5-ht, 3hlabeled 5-ht; fsac,  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase.

subsequent experiments.
tissue localiation studies. human tissues (national disease research institute) were homogenized, and the total
rna was extracted (24). cdna was prepared from 5 ,ug of
total rna with random hexanucleotide primers (500 pmol)
using superscript reverse transcriptase (brl) in pcr reaction buffer (cetus) containing 1 mm dntps, at 42°c for 1 hr.
an aliquot of the first-strand cdna was diluted (1:5) in a
50-iai pcr reaction mixture (200 ,um dntps, final concentration) containing 1.25 units of taq polymerase and 1 um of
primers from the sense strand (5'-tctattctggaggcac-

caaggaac-3') and from the antisense strand (5'tgttgatgggtcagataaagactt-3'). the pcr products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to

charged nylon membrane (zetaprobe, bio-rad). filters were
hybridized and washed under high stringency.

results
we synthesized degenerate oligonucleotide primers on the
basis of sequences corresponding to the third and fifth tm
segments of 5-ht receptors. the primers were designed to
amplify only 5-ht-specific sequences by annealing to the
nucleotide sequence encoding the protein sequence afy(f)ip in tm v. the presence of an alanine (a) rather than a
serine (s) at the amino end of this sequence distinguishes the
closely related adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor families from the serotonergic receptor family. after 30 amplification cycles, agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a clear
pattern of cdna species of -250 base pairs. individual
cdnas were cloned into pbluescript and subjected to sequence analysis. one clone, designated s51, was observed to
encode a distinctive receptor. we then screened a human
genomic lymphocyte library with the pcr fragment s51.
isolation of the full-length coding region was obtained from
a genomic clone designated hl16a. the primary amino acid
sequence of clone hl16a is shown in fig. 1. a long open
reading frame can encode a protein 366 amino acids in length,
having a relative molecular weight (mr) of -42,000. comparison of this protein sequence with previously characterized neurotransmitter receptors indicates that hl16a is most
closely related to the recently characterized  xxxg1111xxx 
(10-12) (fig. 1). the tm amino acid identity of hl16a to other
known 5-ht1 receptors is as follows: 5-htle (70%), 5- xxxg1110xxx 
(63%),  xxxg1110xxx ,0 (60%), and 5-htla (53%).

 xxxd2419xxx  (5-ht2), 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2aminopropane (5-htic/5-ht2),  xxxd2957xxx  (5-ht1a/5-ht1b),
and zacopride (5-ht3) had very poor affinity.
the functional coupling of clone hl16a to adenylate cyclase inhibition was tested in intact nih 3t3 cells (bmax 1
pmol/mg of protein). 5-ht (10 ,um) had no effect on either
basal activity or fsac in untransfected or mock transfected
nih 3t3 cells, indicating an absence of endogenous cyclasecoupled 5-ht receptors in untransfected cells. addition of 10
,tm  xxxd1742xxx  increased the basal camp release (0.036 ±
0.0050 pmol/ml per 10 min) by -10-fold. 5-ht inhibited the
response (fig. 3) with an ec50 value of 7.9 + 0.76 nm and a
maximum percentage inhibition of fsac (emx value) of 74
+ 4.6 (mean ± sem, n = 10). the 5-ht response (1 ,um) was
completely blocked by the nonselective antagonist methiothepin (10 ,um). this antagonism was surmountable (fig.
3), indicating probable competitive antagonism. the dose
shift produced by methiothepin yielded an apparent kb of 438
+ 14 nm, consistent with the k, for this compound (table 1).
no direct effect of methiothepin was seen. no other compound tested in this study was an antagonist. in addition, no
evidence for coupling of this receptor to inositol phospholipid
turnover was detected at a dose of 10 ,m 5-ht.
expression of the  xxxg1112xxx  transcripts was analyzed from
pcr-rna blots and in situ hybridization studies. by pcr,
we detected  xxxg1112xxx  receptor mrna in the human brain,
uterus (endometrium and myometrium), and mesentery (fig.
4) but did not detect it in kidney, liver, spleen, heart,
pancreas, or testes. in in situ hybridization experiments, we
observed  xxxg1112xxx  transcripts in lamina v of frontal cortex
(fig. sa) in large pyramidal cells (fig. sd). moderate labeling
was also detected over layer vi nonpyramidal neurons. in
both layer v and layer vi, the labeling was most evident in
dorsal sensorimotor neocortex and in cingulate and retrosplenal cortices (fig. sc). the pyramidal cells in the piriform
cortex were heavily labeled, as were large neurons in the
raphe nuclei (fig. 5e). hippocampal pyramidal cells in
ca1-ca3 were moderately labeled, as were the granule cells
in the dentate gyrus, and some neurons in the nucleus of the
solitary tract. little labeling was found in the thalamus and
hypothalamus.

the pharmacological profile obtained from cells expressing
gene hl16a (table 1) indicates that it encodes a member of
the 5-htllike receptor subfamily, as 5-ct is an agonist, and
methiothepin is an antagonist (27). as for the  xxxg1111xxx , its closest genetic relative (fig. 1), the affinity for these
compounds is relatively low. nonetheless, the high affinity
for sumatriptan, 5-methoxy- xxxd2686xxx ,  xxxd2621xxx , and other compounds from diverse structural
classes (table 1) distinguishes this additional receptor from
the  xxxg1111xxx  subtype (r = 0.45). we have classified it as a
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor on the basis of its distinctive pharmacology:
the low affinity of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor for 5-ct but the high
affinity of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor for sumatriptan. this activity
clearly distinguishes it from any other 5-ht1 fike-binding site
or functional response model.
the cloned human  xxxg1112xxx  receptor was found to couple to
the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, as do other cloned
members of the 5-ht1like receptor family. this coupling
mimics their accepted functional responses in native tissue
preparations (28-30, except the native  xxxg1111xxx  for
which a functional correlate has not been reported). the
s-ht1f receptor represents the fifth cloned 5-ht receptor
that shows coupling to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase.

neurobiology: adham et al.

the only "5-ht1 receptor" that does not couple to adenylate
cyclase is the 5-htic receptor (31), which is now considered
a member of the 5-ht2 subfamily (2). why so many different
5-ht1 receptor subtypes have been maintained in the genome
is not at all clear. possible explanations include different
midpoints for activation by 5-ht under physiological conditions, different desensitization rates, different efficiencies or
kinetics of coupling to adenylate cyclase inhibition, coupling
to diverse adenylate cyclases, different developmental regulation, coupling to separate ion channels, or coupling to
ion-channel regulation rather than adenylate cyclase regulation as a primary physiological pathway.
localization of transcripts for this receptor indicates a
relatively selective tissue distribution. of tissues reported
here, the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor was detected only in the brain,
uterus, and mesentery. the possible role of this receptor in
uterine or vascular function is intriguing. future studies
defining the specific cell type(s) in these tissues that express
the receptor may provide insight into its function in the
periphery. in the brain, the expression had a limited distribution compared with that of other 5-ht receptors (9). in the
neocortex, labeling of layer v pyramidal neurons may indicate a functional role for the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor protein in the
integration of sensorimotor (somatodendritic; frontal cortex)
or afferent information associated with limbic functions (somatodendritic; cingulate/retrosplenial cortex), or in spinal
cord processes (axonal). strong labeling was also detected in
hippocampal pyramidal cells, in several thalamic nuclei, and
in the dorsal raphe. the detection of transcripts for this gene
in the dorsal raphe nucleus indicates a possible role as an
autoreceptor. this localization is shared by both the 5-htid'
and 5-ht1ds receptors (9). such heterogeneity of autoreceptors has recently been described (32).
the cloned  xxxg1112xxx  receptor does not appear to be any of
the 5-ht1-like receptor subtypes defined in a variety of
isolated tissue preparations by in vitro response assays.
however, such preparations contain heterogeneous populations of 5-ht1.jk. receptors and are primarily studied in
nonhuman tissues. the elucidation of the physiological role
of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor, including its possible autoreceptor
function, awaits the discovery of selective compounds, most
likely through the use of heterologous expression systems
expressing each individual subtype.
