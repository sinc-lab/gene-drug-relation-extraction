 xxxd2705xxx  analogs in indolent non-hodgkin's lymphoma.  this article details both the contribution of the  xxxd2705xxx  analogs to the current management of relapsed indolent non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl) and the role of  xxxd2879xxx  ( xxxd2879xxx ) in that management. of the three  xxxd2705xxx  analogs,  xxxd2879xxx  has received the least attention with regard to the management of indolent nhl. although data in the literature appear to indicate that  xxxd2120xxx  (fludara) and 2- xxxd1712xxx  (cladribine [ xxxd1712xxx ]) are more active in nhl, this conclusion could be flawed because many of the studies investigating  xxxd2879xxx  in indolent nhl have contained a large number of patients previously treated with the other purine analogs. as these agents are most likely cross-resistant, it is unfair to conclude that  xxxd2879xxx  is less active. recently, there has been interest in using a new, more protracted schedule of 2 mg/m2/d of  xxxd2879xxx  for 5 days. although the schedule used in the trials conducted in indolent nhl might not be optimal,  xxxd2879xxx  has nevertheless shown significant activity in these disorders.
