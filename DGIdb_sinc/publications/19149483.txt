abstract: tyrosine kinases (tks) are attractive targets for cancer therapy, as quite often their abnormal signaling has been linked with
tumor development and growth. constitutive activated tks stimulate multiple signaling pathways responsible for dna repair, apoptosis,
and cell proliferation. during the last few years, thorough analysis of the mechanism underlying  xxxg2198xxx ’s activity led to novel
cancer therapy using tks blockers. these drugs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human tumors including head and
neck, gastric, prostate and breast cancer and leukemias. the most successful example of kinase blockers is imatinib ( xxxd2333xxx ,
gleevec, sti571), the inhibitor of  xxxg23xxx  oncoprotein, which has become a first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. the introduction of sti571 for the treatment of leukemia in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on how this disease is currently managed. others kinase inhibitors used recently in cancer therapy include  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) specific for abl non-receptor cytoplasmic kinase, gefitinib (iressa),  xxxd2029xxx  (osi-774, tarceva) and sunitinib ( xxxd3264xxx , sutent) specific for vegf receptor kinase,
amn107 ( xxxd2724xxx ) and inno-406 (ns-187) specific for c-kit kinase. the following tk blockers for treatment of various human tumors are in clinical development: lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate, tykerb,  xxxd2445xxx ),  xxxd421xxx  ( xxxd421xxx ),  xxxd3489xxx  (zd6474),  xxxd3496xxx  ( xxxd3496xxx / xxxd3496xxx ), sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexavar), and  xxxd2450xxx  ( xxxd2450xxx , arava). herein, we discuss the chemistry,
biological activity and clinical potential of new drugs with  xxxg2198xxx  blockers for cancer treatment.

key words: tyrosine kinases, cancer treatment, atp-blockers, monoclonal antibodies, drug resistance.
1. introduction
approximately 20% of human genes code products which participate in cell signaling pathways. principal regulators of these
pathways are phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. there
are 518 kinase sequences encoded in the human genome, of which
430 are expected to be catalytically active [1, 2]. the tyrosine
kinases (tks) determine a separate class of enzymes which are
responsible for phosphorylation of tyrosine residue on targeted
proteins. tyrosine kinases stimulate multiple signaling pathways
responsible for basic cells functions such as growth, proliferation,
migration, synthesis and apoptosis. several oncogenic tyrosine
kinases have been detected in human malignancies, one of the most
extensively studied being  xxxg23xxx , considered as the pathogenic
principle of philadelphia (ph) chromosome-positive human leukemia’s [3]. the  xxxg23xxx  fusion generated by a t(9;22) translocation
mediates its biological effects through deregulated, constitutively
active  xxxg2198xxx  activity [4]. others oncogenic forms of tyrosine kinases including:  xxxg737xxx , tel/jack2, tel/ xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  or
npm/alk can be expressed in different types of tumors, therefore
regulation of tks may play significant role in cancer treatment [58].
there are two main approaches to inhibit activity of oncogenic
tyrosine kinases. the first strategy uses monoclonal antibodies
called ‘mabs’ to block the extracellular domain of  xxxg2198xxx 
receptors. the second approach is based on small molecules called
‘nibs’, with the ability to interact with atp-binding domain, and
inhibit the intracellular kinase activation. some of the tyrosine
kinase blockers show promising results in preclinical studies while
others have already been used for years as a highly effective drugs

in human cancer treatment (e.g.  xxxd2333xxx ) [9]. however,
some patients developed resistance to the treatment resulting in a
general step-back in tks blockers strategy [10]. recent studies
have shown several mechanisms of resistance to tks blockers include: drug binding to inactive kinase, tk gene amplification, point
mutations in atp binding domain or clonal cytogenetic evolution
of cancer cells [11, 12]. in this review, we described a mechanism
of oncogenic  xxxg2198xxx  activation that may provide a concept
design for effective tks blockers that can overcome pharmacological resistance. more importantly we discuss the clinical potential of
novel therapeutic tks blocker that may be used in human cancer
treatment.
2. tyrosine kinases
there are two families of tyrosine kinases –  xxxg1608xxx  kinases and cytoplasmatic no-receptor kinases [13,14].
 xxxg1608xxx  kinases are enzymes which play a role in
intracellular signaling pathways by transmitting signals from membrane receptors to the cell interior and are anchored to cellular
membranes by a hydrophobic transmembrane domain. extracellular
signals are received by this family of enzymes through ligand binding with the membrane receptor’s exterior domain which stimulates
cytoplasmic domain activation. the activation process displays two
essential stages. the first stage relies on the dimerization of receptors which results in their conformation modification. in the second
stage, tks are autophosphorylated which is modulated by regulatory ligands. these processes initiate a cascade of phosphorylation
reactions which activate serial proteins until the signal reaches the
nucleus and causes changes of expression of specific targeted
genes. receptor tyrosine kinases may be classified in following 10
subfamilies [15]:
–

 xxxg681xxx  receptor egfr subfamily:
egfr, erbb2,  xxxg723xxx ;

–

 xxxg1194xxx   xxxg1194xxx  subfamily:  xxxg1145xxx ,  xxxg1194xxx ;

–

trk (tropomyosin-related kinase) subfamily: trka,
trkb,  xxxg1617xxx .

cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases include enzymes activated by
ligands which bond with cellular receptors and unbound kinases
activated by ion transport across cellular membrane or between cell
cycle phases. activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic unbound
kinases are similar to receptor kinases which have reciprocal catalytic domains. each catalytic domain of  xxxg2198xxx  contains a
specific atp binding site which is a phosphate residue donor and
also a substrate binding site, that transfers phosphate residues from
atp. classification of tyrosine kinases is based on their structural
analysis [18]. cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinases are classified in 7
subfamilies as follows [15]:
–

src subfamily which contributes to mitogenesis, activation of mapk kinases, activation of b and t cells, signal
transmission via fc immunoreceptors associate with
 xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  and egfr receptors: fyn,  xxxg1028xxx , lck, lyn,
src;

–

transducers and activators of transcription): jak2,  xxxg1221xxx ;

3. tyrosine kinases in human cancer development
phoshorylation’s activity and signal transudation by tyrosine
kinases in cells is tightly controlled [17-19]. however there are
some mechanisms which allow tyrosine kinases to escape this control and enable signaling pathways including dna repair, apoptosis
and proliferation. in this case, a cell’s homeostasis might be disturbed and the oncogenic transformation processes can be induced.
tyrosine kinases may obtain oncogenic specificity via mutations in
their encoding genes (these genes are cellular proto-oncogene’s).

fusion and form fusion genes (e.g.  xxxg23xxx ) which encode altered
proteins. these proteins frequently display increased phosphorylation activity when compare to wild type kinases. point mutations in
extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains can promote
dimerization and/or autophosphorylation without binding between
ligand and receptor [20,21]. in the  xxxg2198xxx  family there are
proteins responsible for biochemical conversion, which regulate
cells growth, differentiation and death. they can also play a significant role in cancer development. cancer may develop in a multistage process resulting in accumulation of inherited and/or acquired
defects in genes affecting cell cycle regulation [22]. therefore tyrosine kinases might increase uncontrolled proliferation of neoplastic
cells, cancer development or cancer malignant resulting in metastasis without direct initiation of cancer development processes. tyrosine kinases also stimulate angiogenesis processes directly involved
in the growth of the cancer. in some types of the cancer, including
leukemia, expression of proteins with  xxxg2198xxx  specificity
such as  xxxg23xxx  or c-kit was observed. in comparison with normal
cells, these  xxxg2198xxx  proteins demonstrate elevated enzymatic
activity, resulting in abnormal intracellular signaling pathways,
modification for transcription, proliferation and apoptosis. therefore, oncogenic tyrosine kinases disrupt regular cells processes
which cause pathological phenotype development [23-25]. it appears that these specific proteins with  xxxg2198xxx  activity might
be attractive targets for effective cancer therapy fig. (1).
3.1. oncogenic activation of tyrosine kinases
in normal signaling pathways ligand binding to receptors induces oligomerization and activation of  xxxg2198xxx  [26]. conformation changes which result in bound ligands and receptor dation, initiate reciprocal interaction between cytoplasmic domain of
tyrosine kinases. conformation changes of receptors can be generated by monomeric ligands (e.g. activation of epidermal growth
factor egf) or bivalent ligands which induce dimerization of receptors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor pdgf and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx 
receptor) [27-31]. however heterodimerization of receptors may
result in transforming growth factor alpha (tgf) which activates
egfr and c-erbb2 kinases [32, 33]. activation of cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinases may be a response to extracellular signaling, intracellular changes of ca2+ concentration or mitogenesis [26]. cytoplasmic jak kinases are activated in an oligomerization pathway
[34-37], whereas activation of the src kinase family requires
dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in position 527 in src
kinase and their equivalent position in other kinases belonging to
this family of enzymes [38]. kinases which belong to src family
contain three sh (src homology domian) domains at the nterminal end. the sh1 domain is responsible for enzymatic activity; sh2 domain is responsible for binding of  xxxd1075xxx  residue and sh3 regulates enzyme activity [38, 39]. sh2 domain of
non-active form of src kinase binds to phosphorylated tyr572
residue, which is essential for active conformation of enzyme [40].
activation of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases induces the
phosphorylation reaction cascade including enzyme autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of cytoplasmatic substrates and adaptor
proteins (e.g.: phosphorylation of crk-l specific protein for
 xxxg23xxx  kinase). signals generated by kinase can be transferred to
the nucleus, where induced target gene expression results in a cell
response (e.g.: cells division).
activation of oncogenic tyrosine kinases disorders cell stability
processes and establishes constitutive enzyme activity. this process
can be induced in several pathways and by different mechanisms
[41]. one mechanism includes activation via mutations causing
constant  xxxg2198xxx  activity. this pathway results in enzyme
activation independently of ligand binding and is observed in receptor tyrosine kinases isolated from animal viruses. this enzyme
mutagenic activation pathway includes: chromosomal translocations or point mutations which induce modification in extracellular
domain, changes in atp binding complex and modification in the

example of the pathways activated by binding of a ligand (mostly growth factors) to the receptor  xxxg2198xxx .

catalytic part of kinase [42-44]. a second category of mechanisms
includes series of incidents which can be related to ligand duplication, inhibition of inverse regulation pathways and overexpression
or amplification of kinase.
3.2. kinases activation via mutations
there are several known tyrosine kinases which are expressed
in human cancer and activated via mutations. these mutations are
easily identified unlike modifications in an enzyme expression.
many of these mutations were discovered during research in different types of cancers. oncogenic forms of  xxxg2198xxx  can play a
significant role in cancerogenesis. chronic myeloid leukemia
(cml) is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation
between chromosome 9 and 22 [t(9;22)] [45] resulting in the
 xxxg23xxx  oncogene. the encoding protein with constitutive tyrosine
kinase activity is considered a pathogenic principle of the philadelphia chromosome (ph). chromosomal translocation is responsible
for the appearance of oncogenes encoding fusion tyrosine kinases
(ftk’s) such as  xxxg23xxx ,  xxxg737xxx , tel/jak2, tel/pdgfr and
npm/alk [41]. these tks share structural similarity, including an
amino-terminal oligomerization and activation of the associated
tyrosine kinases of the carboxy-terminal fusion partner. point mutations and chromosomal aberrations determine the second potential
source of oncogenic tyrosine activation. modifications in the nucleotide sequence of genes for transmembrane domain can induce
ligand independent kinase activation (e.g.: neu/ xxxg721xxx ) [46-48].
mutations in the transmembrane domain specifically result in expansion of substrates (e.g.: v-ros) [49]. deletions in the extracellular regulatory domain of tyrosine kinases, which induce oncogenic activation of kinase have also been observed [42]. other mutations may result in negative regulation of  xxxg2198xxx  (e.g.:
mutation in tyr527 of src kinase) and mutations occurring in phosphor-binding sites may result in enzyme deregulation.
4.  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors use in cancer
therapy
20 years ago the discovery that some of the oncogenic viruses
can encode  xxxg2198xxx , started a new investigation in finding
directed therapy against classes of  xxxg2198xxx  enzymes. experiments on cancer cells with overexpression of tks have shown
anti-proliferation activity of two inhibitors:  xxxd2271xxx  [50] and
 xxxd3241xxx  [51], which inhibit activity of whole complexes of

kinases. because of the extensive activities spectrum and toxicity of
these inhibitors, it was necessary to increase specificity of their
effect. initially intensive studies using chemical reagents and highly
specific synthetic drugs for a narrowly defined class of kinase were
accepted sceptically, because the activity of these reagents relied on
competitive inhibition of atp binding. the atp binding domain is
highly conservative and form fundamental motive of all kinases
[52].
in 2001 herceptin, a new anti-cancer inhibitor of tyrosine
kinases was introduced for clinical trials. herceptin was the first
humanized monoclonal antibody against  xxxg1615xxx 
her2/neu. this antibody, in combination with paclitaxel, was indicated for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer with
overexpresion of the her-2 protein. in november 2006 the u.s.
food and drug administration (fda) approved herceptin as part
of a treatment regiment containing doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide
and paclitaxel, for adjuvant treatment of patients with her-2positive and node-positive breast cancer [53].
use of herceptin in chemotherapy in patients with metastatic
breast cancer increased their chance of survived. the discovery of
imatinib ( xxxd2333xxx , gleveec, sti-571), which specifically
inhibited activity of  xxxg23xxx  oncogene  xxxg2198xxx  was a breakthrough in leukemia treatment. this drug revolutionized pharmacological strategy for patients with philadelphia chromosome (ph)
translocation. imatinib was approved by fda in 2001 for the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) [20].
gefitinib was the first drug from a new class of anti-cancer agents
formerly known as receptor tyrosine kinases blockers. gefitinib
inhibits activity of the  xxxg681xxx  (egfr) intracellular
 xxxg2198xxx . in 2003 fda approved gefitinib as monotherapy
treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsclc
after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies
[54]. hopefully, future study of human cancer may open the way
for new generation of blocker-drugs directly targeting tyrosine
kinases. searching for high specific blockers which may selectively
interact with oncogenic tyrosine kinases is currently one of the
major goals in molecular pharmacology table 1.

identification of the  xxxg23xxx  oncogenic fusion kinase and its pivotal
role in the pathogenesis of cml provided new opportunities to
develop molecular-targeted therapies. blockers of abl tyrosine
kinase are divided into two groups, atp-competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors.
small molecule blockers of atp domain are a group of inhibitors, which can selectively inhibit the activity receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. crystallography studies of imatinib structure have shown its directed interaction with a highly conserved
domain of tks which binds atp. sti571 is chemically derived
from 2-phenyloaminopyrimidine. it was shown that sti571 binds
preferentially with the non-active conformation of kinase (notphosphorylated) resulting in prevention of enzyme activation and
autophosphorylation [55]. sti571 competes with atp molecule by
blocking its binding site, stopping the transfer of phosphate groups
to tyrosine residues. all kinases in active form display high conformational similarity; however their non-active forms displaying
different structures. these differences relate mostly to the active
loop. in active conformation the loop strikes opened shape with the
c-terminal end pulled away from the catalytic center forming a
platform for substrate binding. non-active conformations form
complexes with sti571. sti571 was identified as an effective
blocker of  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx , c-kit [56] and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  kinases [57]. this drug
is used in treatment of cml patients with  xxxg23xxx  expression and
patients with gastrointestinal stomal tumors (gist) with c-kit
gene expression.
gefitinib (iressa,  xxxd2186xxx ) is the first commercially available
egfr  xxxg2198xxx  blocker and is now registered for use in asia
and the united states in second- or third line therapy for advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer.  xxxd2186xxx  is a small molecule inhibitor,
chemically derived from 4-anilinoquinazoline which displays specificity to the receptor  xxxg2198xxx  group including epidermal
growth factor receptor egfr ( xxxg682xxx ) [58,59].  xxxd2186xxx , like
sti571, is a competitive kinase inhibitor, which blocks atp binding to enzyme catalytic domain. another blocker of egfr kinase is
osi-774, derived from 4-anilinoquinazoline.  xxxd2186xxx  and osi-774
demonstrate 100-fold higher substrate specificity to erb1 that
 xxxg721xxx . atom n1 of quinazoline forms hydrogen bonds with the

nitrogen of the met769 residue. this interaction is important for
atp binding [60]. preliminary data indicated complete tumor inhibition after drug application for ovarian cancer patients [61]. clinical studies with  xxxd2186xxx  monotherapy or combination therapy have
been conducted for many tumor types, including esophageal carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma
[62-67]. therefore, more beneficial effects of  xxxd2186xxx  are expected
[68].
 xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva, osi-774,) is an egfr  xxxg2198xxx 
blocker with proven efficacy in monotherapy trials in advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc), ovarian cancer, pancreatic
cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, and primary glioblastoma [69-71]. osi-774 is registered for the second- and third-line
treatment of patients with advanced nsclc after failure of at least
one prior platinum treatment. since late 2005, osi-774 is also registered for advanced pancreatic cancer. the study of osi-74 in
patients with advanced biliary cancer and hepatocellular cancer
showed a potentially beneficial effect of this blocker [72,73]. clinical trials in metastatic colorectal carcinoma patients with  xxxd2029xxx 
alone or in combination with chemotherapy also showed promising
results [74,75]. osi-774 in combination with bevacizumab evaluated in patients with metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma resulted
in increasing ratio of survival patients as compared with treatment
one of these agents [76]. current studies with pancreatic cancer
patients focus on combinations with chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
and other targeted therapies including maintenance therapy of osi774.
sunitinib (sutent,  xxxd3264xxx ) is an orally available blocker of
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , c-kit, and  xxxg801xxx  kinase activity. the study of
patients with immunotherapy refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with  xxxd3264xxx  showed a statistically significant improvement in median progression free survival (47.3 vs. 24.9
weeks) and objective response rate (24.8% vs. 4.9%) for  xxxd3264xxx 
over ifn- 83 [77,78]. therefore  xxxd3264xxx  might now be considered the new standard first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer. in january 2006, su1128 was not only approved by the fda
for advanced renal cell carcinoma, but also for imatinib-resistant

and imatinib-intolerant gist. moreover, su1128 showed a potentially beneficial effect in previously treated advanced nsclc and
unrespectable neuroendocrine tumors [79].
sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexavar) is a novel oral  xxxg1924xxx  kinase,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ) and  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx 
kinase blocker with antitumor effects in colon, pancreas and breast
cancer cell lines and in colon, breast and non-small-cell lung cancer
xenograft models [80,81].  xxxd3226xxx  was granted fda fast track
approval in december 2005. clinical trials with sorafenib in melanoma and in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and other multiple
tumor types are ongoing [82]. chemical structure of some tyrosine
kinase blockers are presented in fig. (2).
4.2. monoclonal antibodies
one strategy to inhibit tyrosine kinases uses monoclonal antibodies (mab), which are proteins of the immune system. monoclonal antibodies are the most widely used form of cancer immuno-

therapy at this time. monoclonal antibodies recognize and bind to
foreign antigens eliciting an immune response. the first mab used
in immunotherapy directed against tyrosine kinases were antibodies
which recognize new oncogene [83,84]. the unique structures of
extracellular receptor’s domains are useful to create specific monoclonal antibodies that may recognize and block  xxxg2198xxx .
these antibodies have multiple functions which can include: blocking of ligand binding, inhibition of receptor dimerization or initiation of receptor degradation. herceptin is the first drug from the
mab group which recognizes receptor  xxxg721xxx  (erbb2) of tks.
herceptin is used in breast cancer therapy and binding of this drug
prevents receptor oligomerization of oncogene  xxxg721xxx  [53,85].
the antibody recognizes an extracellular fragment of tks but the
epitope is a c- terminal fragment of domain number iv. the
mechanism of herceptin activity on  xxxg721xxx  is still unknown
because domain iv does not participate in direct dimerization of the
receptor; however it is known, that there are localized sites in this
domain which can be identified by matalloproteases. it was demon-

 xxxg2198xxx  blockers

strated that incision of domain iv by metalloproteases stimulates
dimerization of intracellular receptors in pathway up-regulated by
 xxxg721xxx  kinase. perhaps, in this context, binding of monoclonal
antibodies can control activity of metalloproteases and block kinase
 xxxg721xxx  receptor dependent signaling pathway [60]. imc- xxxd467xxx 
(cetuximab, erbitux) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed
against receptor  xxxg2198xxx  egfr (erb1). imc- xxxd467xxx  binds
with the receptor domain and inhibits ligand binding. imc- xxxd467xxx  is
believed to operate by binding to the extracellular domain of the
egfr. this blocks downstream signaling of egfr impairing cell
growth and proliferation [60]. imc- xxxd467xxx  has also been shown to
mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. imc- xxxd467xxx  was
approved by the fda in march 2006 for use in combination with
radiation therapy for treating squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck (scchn) or as single agent in patients who have had
prior platinum-based therapy. imc- xxxd467xxx  is also used in metastatic
colon cancer therapy [86]. it has been estimated that monoclonal
antibodies currently present one fourth of the products clinically
processed so they probably announce a new era in medicine.
5. cellular resistance to  xxxg2198xxx 
blockers
with the generalization of imatinib as a medicine for cml,
new problems related to cellular resistance have appeared. cmlpositive patients with philadelphia chromosome in blast crisis phase
have shown increased activity of  xxxg23xxx  despite imatinib treatment. therefore, imatinib resistance has become a serious problem
in cml anticancer therapy. most frequently the mechanism of
resistance is amplification and/or mutations of the  xxxg23xxx  gene
[87,88]. recent studies have shown mutations in the atp binding
domain which may affect  xxxg23xxx  protein conformation resulting in
imatinib resistance [89,90]. some mutations completely stop
imatinib binding to the target causing total resistance to the drug
while other mutations allow partial binding which leads to moderate
resistance [87,91,92]. to overcome resistance, several approaches
have been studied in vitro and in vivo. they include dose escalation
of imatinib, combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, alternative  xxxg23xxx  inhibitors, inhibitors of kinases downstream of
 xxxg23xxx , farnesyl and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, histone
deacetylase, proteasome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors,
 xxxd226xxx , hypomethylating agents,  xxxd3453xxx  and immunomodulatory strategies [93,94]. finally down-regulation of the
expression by small interfering rna (sirna) or antisense strategies for  xxxg23xxx  mrna can also be used [95,96]; however, it is
important to understand that these approaches differ in efficiency,
which is often dependent on the mechanism of resistance.
attempts to circumvent resistance to imatinib led to the discovery of  xxxd2724xxx  ( xxxd2724xxx ; novartis ag), a novel, potent and selective oral  xxxg23xxx  kinase inhibitor [97].  xxxd2724xxx , an orally bioavailable, selective  xxxg23xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, is 30-fold more
potent than imatinib and overcomes most imatinib resistant  xxxg23xxx 
mutations.  xxxd2724xxx  was effective in patients harboring  xxxg23xxx 
mutations associated with imatinib resistance and also in patients
with a resistance mechanism independent of  xxxg23xxx  mutations.
efficacy has been observed in models of cml and other myeloproliferative disorders that are driven by  xxxg23xxx  and related kinases.
 xxxd2724xxx  has been filed for approval in the us and eu for use in
philadelphia-positive leukemias in patients who are resistant or
intolerant to imatinib.  xxxd2724xxx  is undergoing clinical trials in patients with newly diagnosed cml, acute lymphoblastic leukemia
and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, among other indications
[98,99].
recent studies report an activating mutation in another tks
gene of egfr kinase that seems predictive for response to gefitinib used in nsclc treatment [100-102]. therefore, for future
clinical use, it is important to select patients that are likely to bene-

71

fit from this egfr kinase inhibitor, while non-selection is likely
the main cause of the disappointing results of gefitinib.
various cellular mechanisms may be involved in the nature of
cellular resistance. increased amount of target, alteration in structure of target proteins, decreased drug uptake and increased detoxification are well-known mechanisms of resistance. identification of
all possible mechanisms which participate in inhibitor resistance
require further studies. it is known that mutations are characteristic
for patients in an advanced stage of the disease. this information
leads to some important questions. why do these mutations occur?
what new methods should be developed and used to inhibit disease
relapse? the models show that in the last stage (blast crisis) of
cml disease, cells display genomic instability and accumulate
mutation during progressive development of disease. treatment
with drugs-like kinase inhibitors takes advantage of effective selection of drug resistance alleles. future studies may help design appropriate inhibitor which can be chosen in patients treatment at an
early stage of cancer disease.
5.1. novel  xxxg2198xxx  blockers
 xxxd2333xxx  has dramatically changed the strategy for
chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) therapy. however, resistance is
often reported in advanced-stage cml patients. several novel tks
blockers have been developed to overcome imatinib resistance
mechanism due to point mutations within the abl kinase domain
fig. (3). recently, a novel  xxxg23xxx /lyn dual inhibitor inno-406
(ns-187), which shows a unique profile to overcome this resistance, has been successfully developed.

 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ), ap23464,  xxxd359xxx , and  xxxd1131xxx 
are classified as src/abl inhibitors, while  xxxd2724xxx  (amn107) and
inno-406 (ns-187) belong to the 2-phenylaminopyrimidin-based
subclass of inhibitors. clinical studies of  xxxd2724xxx  and other compounds, including  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd359xxx  and inno-406, have been
performed in rapid succession. because of their strong affinities for
the atp-binding site compared to imatinib, most atp-competitive
inhibitors may be effective in imatinib-resistant patients. however,
an atp-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation
of t315i  xxxg23xxx  has not yet been developed. instead, atp noncompetitive inhibitors, such as on012380, aurora kinase inhibitor
mk0457 (vx-680), and  xxxg1368xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1929xxx , have
been developed to address this problem [93].
the activity of the novel tks inhibitor inno-406 against human cells with mutated kit was investigated. human mast (hmc)1.1 cells with juxtamembrane domain mutation v560g, and hmc1.2 cells with both v560g and the kinase domain mutation d816v,
were treated with inno-406. inno-406 was potent against hmc1 cells regarding cell proliferation, inhibition of kit phosphorylation, and induction of apoptosis. these results suggested clinical
potential for inno-406 in kit v560g-expressing malignancies
[103].
6. rationale engineering of  xxxg2198xxx 
blockers
the introduction of imatinb for the treatment of cml in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on the way this disease is
managed [45]. studies have shown that imatinib acts by binding the
inactive form of the abl kinase domain of  xxxg23xxx , and the structural basis for the autoinhibition of the  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx   xxxg2198xxx  has
been solved [104]. imatinib has rapidly become the first-line therapy for cml, however the acquired resistance in patients incurs a

serious clinical problem [105]. the development of resistance to
imatinib is a frequent setback, particularly in patients in advanced
phases of the disease. recently it has been found that some mutations in the atp-binding domain of abl gene lead to conformational changes in the  xxxg23xxx  oncoprotein resulting in impairment
of imatinib binding and leading to clinical resistance [106].
during the last few years, the thorough analysis of the mechanisms underlining the  xxxg23xxx  pathway has led to novel strategies
in leukemia treatment. it was found that  xxxg23xxx  induced resistance
to cytotoxic drugs by upregulating dna repair mechanisms [107].
moreover, it was demonstrated that imatinib sensitized  xxxg23xxx 
expressing cells to cytotoxic dna damaging agents by depleting
the anti-apoptotic properties associated with  xxxg23xxx  [108]. these
results support new strategies to combine a dna damaging agent
with  xxxg23xxx  kinase inhibition into a single molecule in order to
induce the enhanced potency in cml cells. the “combi-targeting”
therapy is a new approach to rationale engineering of tks blockers
[108]. the synthesis of compounds with mixed  xxxg23xxx -dna targeting prosperities may well represent a single kinase blocker alternative to imatinib or a new type of agent to be used in combination
with it. the first reported  xxxg23xxx -dna blocker is 3-methyl-1,2,3triazene (zrcm5) [92]. chemotherapeutic agents of the triazen
class had been before used in the clinical management of many
tumors including brain cancers, leukemias and melanomas. their
mechanisms of action are based on the generation of an alkyldizodium species that damages dna at the o6 and n7 position of guanine. the binary  xxxg23xxx -dna targeting properties of zrcm5 is
based on a 2-phenyloaminopyrimidine moiety targeted to  xxxg23xxx 
kinase and a triazene tail capable of generating a methylodiazonium
species upon hydrolysis. thus, the significant potency of zrcm5
against the leukemia cells is attributed to its ability to simultaneous
blocking of  xxxg23xxx  and related with dna repair activity while

 xxxg2198xxx  blockers

including significant dna lesion in  xxxg23xxx  expressing leukemia
cells.
the combination of zrmc5 with imatinib is a promising
treatment for  xxxg23xxx -positive cml, especially when more aggressive therapies are required for patients in blast crisis [52,94]. the
in vitro studies are ongoing to increase zrmc5 affinity as a single
blocker agent and the “combi-targeting” strategy may become an
answer to imatinib acquired resistance in leukemia treatment. most
likely, further investigations into the molecular mechanisms of
leukemia will guide the design of new treatment modalities in clinical trials.
a new anti-cancer drug available for patients who have progression of breast cancer is a small molecule kinase inhibitor lapatinib chemically derived from quinazolin-4 xxxd2850xxx  and developed
by glaxosmithkline company (gsk). lapatinib is an atp competitive dual kinase inhibitor of egfr and her2/neu ( xxxg682xxx -2)
which inhibits receptor autophosphorylation and activation. the
drug was approved by fda on march 2007, for use in patients with
metastatic breast cancer in combination with chemotherapy drug
 xxxd425xxx  (xeloda). clinical trial demonstrated that additionally
therapy with lapatinib delayed the time of cancer growth compared
to  xxxd425xxx  alone [109, 110]. the most adverse drug-related
treatment effects included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and rash.
however the survival data are not yet mature. recently, a novel
combination therapy of lapatinib and herceptin was proposed. burris et al. observed a synergistic and anti-proliferative effect against
erbb2-positive breast cancer cells in vitro. the optimally tolerated
regimen with clinical activity was lapatinib at dose 1,000 mg per
day combined with herceptin treatment at 4 mg/kg loading dose
then 2 mg/kg weekly [111]. progress in the combine drug therapy
base on lapatinib offers an important advance for patients with
her2 positive metastatic breast cancer. the natural product,
sl0101 initially isolated from plant foresteronia refracta found in
the south america rainforest is a kaempferol glycoside that belongs
to the class of competitive atp binding inhibitor. sl0101 specific
inhibits the serine/threonine p90 ribosomal s6 kinase (rsk) activity. rsk kinases function as downstream effectors of mapk kinase
[112, 113] and have been implicated in various human cancers including prostate, and breast cancer. the rsk family consists of
four isoform  xxxg1987xxx ,  xxxg1988xxx , rsk3, rsk4 products of separate
genes [114]. sl0101 was reported to inhibit proliferation of the
mcf-7 human breast cancer cell line but does not effect the growth
of the normal breast line mcf-10a even though inhibits rsk activity in both cell lines [115, 116]. furthermore, the growth of the
human prostate cancer cell line lncap and pc-3 the androgenindependent more aggressive human prostate cancer than lncap
was inbibited by sl0101. it was also found that inhibition of rsk
activity in lncap cells by s0101 decreased expression of the  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) [117]. sl0101 or a chemically modified version may be a promising drug target for these cancers.
other therapeutic strategies were developed as a need for specific therapy, which can affect a broad range of cancer and reduce
side effects fig. (4). one of them uses long antisense rna (asrna) or rna interference (sirna) which may selectively inhibit
expression of specific gene targets implicated in cancer development. asrna and sirna inhibit gene expression by paring to complementary mrna [118]. asrna transcribed in cells from plasmid
or viral vectors is more efficient at long term gene silencing. it was
reported that asrna silences the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein [119]
and telomerase [120] in cell culture, leading to inhibition of cell
growth. moreover, asrna was found to inhibit the tumorigenicity
of cells with insuline-like growth factor 1 receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ) [121]
and vegf [122]. additionally asrna may successfully silence
egfr in vivo in subcutaneous xenografts of nude mice, leading to
tumor growth inhibition. these inhibitory effects will occur in
healthy cells as well, leading to undecirable side effects [118].
sirna was primarily described in the caenorhabditis elegans

anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry, 2009, vol. 9, no. 1

73

[123]. the advantage of sirna molecules is high specificity to
unique mrna transcripts that may be present in cancer cells, sometimes only different from the wild type transcript by a single point
mutation. sirna may be used to target  xxxg23xxx  and npm/alk oncogenic fusion transcripts in leukemias and lymphomas [124]. in
human pancreatic carcinoma sirna was shown to inhibit the oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  mutant but not affect the wild-type  xxxg1285xxx  transcript
[125]. resistance to asrna and sirna could results from activation of alternative signal transduction pathway and enhance independent cell proliferation viability. also, mutation in transcripts
inhibits hybridization with the asrna or sirna and interfere gene
silencing as well. asrna and sirna have great potential as an
anticancer agents but additional studies are required.
summary
a new therapeutic approach is necessary to improve the treatment of cancer patients. it is possible that agents such as imatinib or
gefitinib classified to  xxxg2198xxx  blockers, will target and kill
the cancer precursor cells, protect normal tissues, and consequently
will be less toxic for patients then other anticancer agent used in
cancer therapy. it is believed that preclinical studies will develop
novel tyrosine kinases blockers effective in cancer treatment. future
treatment regiments are likely to include multiple  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors, based on biogenetics of the tumor cells, in combination
with other anticancer agents. hopefully this may provide new molecular targets for human tumors and accelerate real progress in the
treatment of patients with this disease.
