abstract
non-steroideal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are competitive inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (cox), the enzyme that mediates
biosynthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from  xxxd208xxx . there are at least two different isoforms of the enzyme known as
cox-1 and -2. site directed mutagenesis studies suggest that non-selective cox inhibitors of diverse chemical families exhibit differential
binding modes to the two isozymes. these results cannot clearly be explained from the sole analysis of the crystal structures of cox
available from x-ray diffraction studies. with the aim to elucidate the structural features governing the differential inhibitory binding
behavior of these inhibitors, molecular modeling studies were undertaken to generate atomic models compatible with the experimental
data available. accordingly, docking of different cox inhibitors, including selective and non-selective ligands: rofecoxib,  xxxd2423xxx ,
 xxxd3265xxx ,  xxxd446xxx ,  xxxd3563xxx , indomethacin, diclofenac and meclofenamic acid were undertaken using the amber program. the
results of the present study provide new insights into a better understanding of the differential binding mode of diverse families of cox
inhibitors, and are expected to contribute to the design of new selective compounds. © 2002 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
cyclooxygenase (cox) is an endogenous enzyme that
catalyzes the first committed step in the conversion of
 xxxd208xxx  into prostaglandins and thromboxanes.
these molecules mediate different important functions in the
gastric, renal and hematic systems and regulate different processes like inflammation and body temperature [1,2]. cox
is competitively inhibited by a group of drugs known as
non-steroideal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). their
action results in the anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic and antithrombotic activity exhibited by this group of
molecules. members of this group include well known therapeutic agents like aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin or naproxen [3]. spite of their beneficial action, their
activity is associated with deleterious side effects, and continuous administration of these drugs leads to nefrotoxicity
and gastric ulcerations [4,5]. consequently, new nsaids
without side effects are necessary for safer treatments.
a key discovery in the search of novel anti-inflammatory
therapeutic agents lacking the deleterious side effects exhibited by traditional nsaids, came from the characterization
and isolation of two different cox isoforms, known as

cox-1 and -2. interestingly, although the two enzymes
catalyze the same chemical transformation, both isoforms
are subject to a different expression regulation. thus, while
cox-1 is constitutively expressed and it is involved in
the synthesis and supply of the necessary  xxxd208xxx 
metabolites for a maintenance of gastric and renal functions
as well as for an adequate vascular homeostasis, cox-2 is
expressed only after an inflammatory stimulus, releasing
metabolites that are used to induce inflammation and pain
[6–8]. this discovery, together with the fact that traditional
nsaids show very little selectivity for cox-2, prompted to
suggest [9] that the therapeutic anti-inflammatory action of
nsaids is produced by inhibition of cox-2, while the unwanted side effects arise from inhibition of cox-1 activity.
accordingly, a great deal of interest has been devoted in
recent years to the discovery of selective cox-2 inhibitors.
as a result of these investigations, the two first cox-2
selective inhibitors: celecoxib [10] and rofecoxib [11] are
already in clinical use. these new structures exhibit an
increased selectivity for cox-2 and little side effects [12].
their success as therapeutic agents, justifies the enormous
expectations and interest in the discovery of new leads.
the process of designing novel selective cox inhibitors
requires to characterize structural differences between the
two isozymes. crystal structures of both cox-1 and -2 with
different ligands docked in their active site were solved using

x-ray diffraction methods and are nowadays available in
the literature [13–17]. overall differences between the two
structures are small as illustrated in fig. 1, and superposition
of the 3d structures yields a rmsd of 0.9 å computed from
the ␣-carbons of the two isozymes. the 3d structure of the
two enzymes exhibit three common domains [18]: (a) the region between residues 34 and 72 at the n-terminus, known
as the  xxxg681xxx  domain (residue numbering
refers to cox-1 throughout the present work); (b) the membrane binding domain, between residues 73 and 116, with
numerous hydrophobic residues involved in its attachment to
the cell membrane; (c) the c-terminus, a large domain containing the cox active site on top of a hydrophobic channel
connecting it to the membrane domain.
the two enzymes are highly homologous, exhibiting a
61% sequence identity that achieves a 87% when only the
subset of residues located in the cox active site are compared. alignment of the two sequences reveals the insertion of
a proline residue after ile106 in cox-2. however, since this
residue is located on a loop of the membrane domain, the insertion does not perturb the overall 3d structure of the enzyme
[19]. the largest number of non-conserved residues are located at the membrane domain. however, most of the substitutions preserve their hydrophobic profile, consistent with its
putative role as membrane anchoring domain of the enzyme.

inhibition of the enzyme at the molecular level is mediated through the blockade of  xxxd208xxx  to access
the cox active site. accordingly, a detailed analysis of this
binding site provides keys for designing novel inhibitors
with increased affinity and selectivity. inspection of the
cox active site reveals three differential regions, shown in
fig. 2: (a) a hydrophobic pocket beneath the heme group,
defined by the residues tyr385 , trp387 , phe518 , ala201 ,
tyr248 and leu352 ; (b) the mouth of the active site, with
three hydrophilic residues flanking its entrance: arg120 ,
glu524 , tyr355 , and arranged to form a hydrogen bond network; (c) a side pocket, larger in cox-2, defined by several
conserved residues including his90 and the non-conserved
residues his/arg513 and ile/val523 .
in spite of the insight provided from the comparative analysis of the structures of the two isozymes solved by x-ray
diffraction studies, crystal structures alone cannot provide a
complete explanation of different information obtained from
diverse mutagenesis studies, strongly pointing that nsaids
exhibit differential docking modes in the cox active site
[20–29]. in this conditions, modeling studies are required
in order to construct molecular models that incorporate
all experimental evidence reported. these models are necessary to obtain a consistent, more precise picture of the
enzyme–inhibitor recognition step at the atomic level and

well as the side chains of key residues are explicitly shown.

furthermore, provide new insights that can be used to design
novel therapeutic agents.
the purpose of the present work is to construct molecular models of different inhibitor–enzyme complexes based
on the available structural information of cox inhibition,
that incorporate the findings of different site mutagenesis
experiments. specifically, the present work reports the results of a series of docking studies of a selective (rofecoxib)
and diverse non-selective ( xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd3265xxx ,  xxxd446xxx ,
 xxxd3563xxx , indomethacin, diclofenac and meclofenamic
acid) cox inhibitors (see in fig. 3 for structures), into the
cox active site of the two isoforms. this information is important to characterize the structural features of the different
families of nsaids relevant for their recognition with each
of the two isozymes as well as provide new insights for the
design of novel more potent selective inhibitors.

2. methods
crystal structures of the enzymes cox-1 (entry 1prh)
[13] and cox-2 (entry 3pgh) [14] with  xxxd2141xxx  bound
to the cox binding site were obtained from the brookhaven
data bank [30]. coordinates of the ligand were removed

from the files and the structures of the two enzymes were energy minimized in vacuo with a distance dependent dielectric constant 4r, using a conjugated gradient minimization
algorithm implemented in the amber program [31], until
the rmsd of two successive iterations was <0.001 å. all the
molecular mechanics calculations reported in the present
work, were performed using the all-atom parm91 force field
set of parameters [32]. structures of the inhibitors studied
in the present work were constructed using the prep module of amber. force field parameters were taken from
the standard parm91 set and partial atomic charges were
generated by fitting the molecular electrostatic potential,
computed with a sto-3g basis set using the gaussian94
suite of programs [33]. ligands were manually docked into
the cox binding pocket of cox-1 and -2, guided by the
crystal structures of structurally related inhibitors [13–16],
site directed mutagenesis studies and grid calculations
[34,35] performed on the cox binding site of the enzyme
with diverse probes. complexes generated were energy
optimized in vacuo, with a distance dependent dielectric
constant of 4r, using a conjugated gradient minimization
algorithm until the rmsd of two successive iterations was
<0.001 å. display and examination of the models was
carried out using the insightii program [36].

3. results
results of the computations performed in the present work
are described below and are organized by families according
to the chemical structures of the different inhibitors studied.
3.1. phenyl acetic acids:  xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd446xxx ,
fenoprofen and  xxxd3265xxx 
members of this group of nsaids are characterized by
a 2-methylphenylacetic scaffold with an aromatic moiety
attached in meta (see fig. 3). specifically, the different
members of this family selected for the present study exhibit

the following aromatic rings: a benzoyl moiety in the
case of  xxxd2423xxx , a phenoxy moiety in fenoprofen, a
thienylcarbonyl moiety in  xxxd3265xxx .  xxxd446xxx  is a tricyclic
molecule that can be understood as an 6-chloroindole moiety fused to the phenyl acetic ring. these compounds are
non-selective nsaids and their relative inhibitory potency
in cox-1 follows the order [37]:  xxxd2423xxx  >  xxxd3265xxx  >
fenoprofen >  xxxd446xxx . interestingly, the s-enantiomers
of these ligands are more potent than the corresponding
r-stereoisomers in all the cases.
manual docking of the inhibitors using insightii [36] was
performed by placing the different ligands in the cox active
site of the two isozymes, using the crystal structures of the

o. llorens et al. / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 20 (2002) 359–371

structurally related inhibitor  xxxd2141xxx  as template [13,14]
and taking into consideration the mutagenesis studies
available. for this purpose, several molecular interactions
were considered to be responsible for the observed affinities (see fig. 4): (i) a hydrogen bond interaction between
the ligand carboxylate moiety and the guanidinium moiety
of the arg120 side chain; (ii) a hydrogen bond interaction
between the heteroatom bridging the two aromatic rings of
the ligand and the side chain of ser530 and (iii) a hydrophobic interaction between the aromatic moiety common to the
different ligands and the aromatic pocket formed by the side
chains of tyr385 , trp387 , phe518 , ala201 , tyr348 and leu352 .
after energy minimization, complexes were inspected to
check whether the different ligand–enzyme key interactions
were conserved during the minimization process. it is important to note that, due to the multiple minima problem
associated with the ligand–enzyme potential energy surface,
several docking attempts had to be undertaken for each
ligand. those complexes conserving all key interactions
after minimization, were considered representative models
of the corresponding ligand. it was found that all the compounds, but fenoprofen, preserved all key interactions after
optimization. as illustration, fig. 4 shows the optimized
structure of  xxxd2423xxx  docked into the cox-1 active site. in
the fenoprofen complex, the interaction between the ligand
and the ser530 side chain could not be preserved and in the
final structure the ligand appears displaced from its initial
position, with a structure where the ether oxygen and the hydroxyl moiety of the ser530 side chain lie at a long distance
from each other. this is likely due to the higher rotational
freedom exhibited by the phenyl ring of this ligand, and
corroborated by the observation that after different attempts
of docking fenoprofen to the active site, the ether oxygen
was found in all the cases pointing outwards the ser530 .
analysis of these complexes reveals some ligand key
structural features that appear relevant for their inhibitory
activity. thus, present results suggest that the dihedral angle
between the two aromatic rings around 30◦ is important for
an efficient ligand–receptor interaction. this explains the
poorer affinity exhibited by  xxxd446xxx , where the two aromatic rings are constrained to be in the same plane. another
structural feature regards the size of the aromatic moiety.
a phenyl moiety fills better the hydrophobic pocket next
to tyr385 providing a stronger interaction with the enzyme,
as supported by the lower potency exhibited by  xxxd3265xxx  as
compared with that of  xxxd2423xxx . present models also suggest that the lower affinity of fenoprofen can be explained
as a consequence of the two effects. on the one hand, the
larger rotational freedom exhibited by the molecule through
the ether moiety in comparison with the other ligands of the
same family and on the other, its poorer hydrogen bond acceptor capability as compared to a carbonyl oxygen, which
results in a loss of a key interaction with the side chain of
ser530 .
the observed preference of the s-enantiomers for cox,
as deduced from the structure-activity studies of this family

363

of compounds can also be explained with the use of present
models. inspection of s- and r-complexes of any of the inhibitors with any of the two enzymes, reveals that in the
case of the s-enantiomer, when the carboxylate moiety of
the ligand faces residue arg120 , the methyl group faces
a small hydrophobic pocket near leu531 . in contrast, in
all the r-enantiomers complexes the methyl group experiences a steric clash with ile/val523 resulting in a steric of
ligand–enzyme interaction.
further inspection of the cox active site suggests that,
in addition to the docking orientation described above for
this family of inhibitors, these molecules can also be accommodated inside the active site in a second orientation. in
this novel orientation, the molecular axis rests in the direction defined between residues arg120 and arg513 , filling the
lateral pocket of the cox active site. there are two initial
possible starting docking structures labeled as models 1 and
2, respectively. taking  xxxd2423xxx  as a proof of principle,
in model 1 the carboxylic moiety rests close to arg513 and
the molecule extends towards the mouth of the active site
with its ketone group interacting with tyr355 . on the other
hand, in model 2 the carboxylate rests close to arg120 and
the phenyl ring penetrates into the side pocket. a hydrogen
bond between the ketone and tyr355 is also present. optimization of the proposed complexes shows that  xxxd2423xxx 
remains stable in model 2 (see fig. 5) in the two isozymes,
exhibiting interactions between the carboxylate group and
arg120 , the ketone group with tyr355 and phenyl ring with
phe518 . in the case of model 1, although the inhibitor is
well accommodated in the side pocket, the interaction with
arg513 is not possible, and the ligand shows an interaction
with tyr355 and his90 instead. interestingly, in cox-1 the
inhibitor is shifted from the side pocket due to an steric clash
between of the more voluminous ile523 (val in cox-2) and
the methyl group of the acetic acid moiety. in contrast, in
cox-2 this methyl group is placed in a hydrophobic pocket
surrounded by gly519 , ala516 , phe518 and val523 .
3.2. acetic acid derivatives:  xxxd3563xxx 
 xxxd3563xxx  was selected as a representative inhibitor of
the acetic acid family of nsaids. the molecule (see fig. 3)
consist of a substituted pyrrole ring that serves as scaffold to
attach an acetyl moiety in position 5, two methyl groups in
positions 1 and 3, respectively, and a 4-chlorobenzoyl group
in position 2.
due to steric hindrance the molecule adopts a conformation where the planes of the two aromatic moieties are
perpendicular to each other. since the structure of the ligand
exhibits the same key structural features of the phenylacetic
inhibitors, it was considered that the molecule docks into
the cox active site in a similar orientation as  xxxd2141xxx .
consequently, docking of the compound was guided by the
crystal structures of the  xxxd2141xxx  complexes, that were
used as template. accordingly, the molecule was placed
in the active site with the ketone group facing the ser530

side chain, the carboxylate group placed in the vicinity
of arg120 and the phenyl ring placed inside the aromatic
pocket near tyr385 . after the minimization process, the two
latter interactions remained, whereas the interaction between the ketone group and the ser530 side chain was lost in
all the attempts undertaken. analysis of the final structure
reveals the key role played by the two methyl groups in the
docking process. indeed, after optimization the two methyl
groups rest on favorable hydrophobic regions, surrounded
by residues leu353 , leu351 and val349 . accordingly, the two
methyl groups of  xxxd3563xxx  play a dual role in explaining
the docking process of the ligand. on the one hand, they
constrain the relative orientation of the 4-chlorobenzoyl and
pyrrole rings, and on the other, force the orientation of the
ligand inside the active site, in such a way that the ketone
group remains distant of the ser530 side chain. this two features explain the lower affinity exhibited by the compound
compared to  xxxd2423xxx .
3.3. fenamic acid derivatives: meclofenamic acid
ligands of this family of inhibitors consist of a
 xxxd189xxx  moiety with an aromatic ring attached
in ortho. specifically, meclofenamic acid exhibits an aromatic ring with two bulky chlorine substituents in positions
2 and 6, in addition to a methyl group in position 3. the
two chlorines flank the amino group that links the aromatic
ring to the  xxxd189xxx  moiety.
site directed mutagenesis studies identified different
amino acids playing a key role in meclofenamic acid binding. thus, mutation of ser530 to met530 [26] leads to a loss
of inhibition of the ligand, however, mutation of ser530 to
ala530 only slightly affects its binding affinity [29]. furthermore, mutation of arg120 to glu120 in cox-2 does not
affect binding of the inhibitor [25]. these results clearly
suggest that the carboxylate moiety of the inhibitor does
not interact directly with the side chain of arg120 .
in order to identify prospective points in the active site
suitable to accommodate the carboxylate moiety of the
inhibitor, interaction maps using a carbonyl probe were
computed by means of the grid program [34,35]. these
calculations identified two hot spots suitable to provide such
a favorable interaction: (i) a region between residues tyr355
and ser353 and (ii) a region located in the neighborhood of
ser530 and tyr385 (see fig. 6). in order to identify regions
for suitable interaction regions where the inhibitor aromatic
rings could be accommodated in the active site additional
grid calculations using an aromatic probe were also computed. fig. 6 shows the results of these calculations that
were subsequently used to generate different positions for
ligand docking purposes.
when the ligand was placed in the active site with the
carboxylate moiety facing the region between tyr355 and
ser353 , no stable docking was found after minimization, even
though different starting geometries were tried. in contrast,
when the acid moiety was placed facing the region between

365

ser530 and tyr385 a stable complex could be observed during
the minimization process. in its orientation, the inhibitor
carboxylate group attains a conformation that is stabilized
by a hydrogen bond between the amine nitrogen and the
carbonyl oxygen of the acid (yellow ligand in fig. 4), similar
to the unproductive x-ray crystal structure of arachidonic
acid bound to cox-2 [39].
the model described above provides an explanation of
the slight decrease of affinity produced by the mutation of
ser530 to ala530 . specifically, it can be explained assuming
that there is no specific interaction between the ligand and
the ser530 side chain. in this case, since the volume of the
two side chains is similar the mutation does not create any
additional steric hindrance and the affinity is expected to be
similar. the loss of the proton donor capability is compensated by the complementary role played by the pair tyr385
and ser530 in the interaction with the inhibitor carboxylate
moiety. in contrast, the mutation ser530 to met530 produces
a dramatic drop in affinity. this result can be explained on
the basis of a steric hindrance produced by the larger volume of the methionine side chain that prevents binding of
the ligand. it is worth noting that this effect is not observed
in other inhibitors like  xxxd2423xxx  or indomethacin, due to
their differential docking orientation.
3.4. 2-aminophenylacetic derivatives: diclofenac
ligands of this family of inhibitors consist of a
2-aminophenylacetic acid scaffold, with an aromatic ring attached in ortho. these structures differ slightly compared to
the fenamates, exhibiting an extra methylene unit between
the carboxylate group and the aromatic ring. specifically,
diclofenac exhibits an aromatic ring with two bulky chlorine substituents in positions 2 and 6, flanking the amino
group that links the two aromatic rings (see fig. 3).
like meclofenamic acid, binding of diclofenac is not
altered by the mutation of arg120 to glu120 [25], but is
dramatically affected by mutation of ser530 to met530 [26].
unfortunately, there are no experimental results available
for the ser530 to ala530 mutation.
in order to explore possible docking orientations of the
ligand into the cox binding site, grid interaction maps
using both a carbonyl and a aromatic, respectively, were
used as guide (see fig. 6). like in the previous case, starting structures were constructed by placing the carboxylate
moiety of the inhibitor at a close distance of the pairs
tyr355 /ser353 or tyr385 /ser530 . docking proceeded in a similar fashion as described above for meclofenamic acid. geometry optimization of the complexes revealed that residues
tyr355 /ser353 are not accessible to the inhibitor acid moiety.
in contrast, diclofenac appears to be able to interact with the
pair tyr385 /ser530 in two different conformations. in one of
the conformations, the inhibitor exhibits a similar geometry to meclofenamic acid, where the dichlorophenyl ring is
extended through the hydrophobic channel of the active
site. on the other conformation, the phenyl ring rests in an

site. a starting docking structure of meclofenamic acid (in yellow) is also shown.

aromatic pocket between residues trp387 and leu352 , as
shown in fig. 4. no clear preference between the two complexes can be assessed so far, since both conformations
exhibit similar interactions with the receptor and both are
consistent with the mutagenesis results and with the grid
calculations.
3.5. indolacetic acid derivatives: indomethacin
the structure of indomethacin consists of an 1h-indole3-acetic acid scaffold substituted with a p-chlorobenzoyl
moiety in position 1, a methyl and an acetyl groups in positions 2 and 3, respectively, and a methoxyl group in position
5. the molecule exhibits two conformations, denoted as cis
and trans, that are interchangeable through a 180◦ rotation
around the amide bond, and evidenced in its crystal structure
of the isolated molecule [39].
the crystal structure of the iodine analog of indomethacin
bound to cox-1, could not be solved at a higher resolution
than 4.5 å [40]. at this resolution only the electron density
of the iodine atom of indomethacin could unambiguously be
located, showing that the iodophenyl moiety binds at the end
of the long channel near the tyr385 as found for phenyl acetic
acid family of inhibitors. the rest of the molecule could be

fitted inside the cox binding site in the two possible cisand trans-conformations. in contrast, the crystal structure of
indomethacin bound to cox-2 at 2.9 å resolution solved by
a different group shows the cis-conformation [16].
according to the previous discussion, both the cis- and
the trans-conformations of indomethacin were considered as
starting structures for docking studies. both conformations
can be docked into the binding pocket of both isozymes with
the carboxylate moiety in the vicinity of arg120 , the ketone
group facing ser530 side chain and the p-chlorophenyl ring
accommodated in the aromatic pocket near tyr385 . however,
whereas in the cis-conformer the indole is surrounded by
val349 , ser353 and leu352 , in the trans-isomer this moiety
lies next to val349 , ala527 , leu531 .
the superposition of the final structures of the two isomers bound to cox-1, after the optimization process are depicted pictorially in fig. 7. analysis of the two complexes of
cox-1 reveals that all the interactions of the starting complex in both isozymes are preserved during the minimization
process. however, in the resulting trans-cox-1 complex, the
guanidinium and carboxylate moieties lie in different planes
as had already found in the crystal structure [40]. in contrast,
in the case of the cox-2 complexes, whereas the cis-isomer
maintains all the interactions of the starting structure, in the

trans-isomer, the interaction between the ketone group and
the ser530 side chain is lost, although in both complexes the
guanidinium and carboxylate moieties remain in the same
plane, similarly to the structures of the cis-cox-1 complex.
these results suggest that the trans-conformation exhibits
lower affinity than the cis-isomer for both isozymes. specifically, in cox-2 the reason of the lower affinity appears to
be the loss of the interaction between ser530 side chain and
the carbonyl moiety. in contrast, in cox-1 the lower affinity is due to the poor interaction between the carboxylate
and the guanidinium moieties appears to be detrimental for
its binding capacity.
these results agree with the x-ray diffraction structures
reported. in the case of cox-1, although the structure could
not be unambiguously refined to a higher resolution than
4.5 å, based on different structural arguments and the
inhibitory activity of the two geometric isomers of the
indomethacin analog ((z/e)-1-(p-chlorobenzylidene)-2methyl-5-methoxyindenylacetic acid (also known as mk715) [41], the authors proposed the cis-conformation as the
most favorable complex. on the other hand, in the case of the
cox-2 complex the cis-isomer is the only structure found
in the crystals, supporting the hypothesis of present models.
3.6. tricyclic derivatives: rofecoxib
the structure of rofecoxib consist of a central five membered lactone ring scaffold with a 4-(methylsulphonyl)phenyl
moiety and by a phenyl ring attached to it (see fig. 3). this
tricyclic structure is common to many high affinity selective
cox-2 ligands.

was placed in the vicinity of the arg120 side chain; (2) in
model 2, the carbonyl oxygen was placed close to the side
chain of ser530 to consider the possible formation of hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen and the side chain
of ser530 . in both complexes, the sulphone was placed in the
vicinity of the arg513 side chain. the energy optimization
process of the two complexes revealed model 2 to be more
favorable, due to good accommodation of the aromatic ring
in the hydrophobic pocket, as can be seen in fig. 8.
3.6.2. docking of rofecoxib in the active site of cox-1
docking of rofecoxib into the active site of cox-1 was
performed using the previously refined rofecoxib–cox-2
complex as template. accordingly, the different key interactions between the ligand and the enzyme were conserved
in the starting structures: (i) the sulphone moiety was
placed in the side pocket, facing his513 , the phenyl ring was
placed in the upper aromatic pocket and carbonyl moiety was placed close to ser530 side chain. after energy
minimization, the inhibitor remained in the same position,
suggesting that the steric hindrance due to the substitution
ile/val523 is not enough for preventing the binding of the
ligand to cox-1. the superposition of cox-1 and -2 models reveal that the sulphone moiety can be accommodated
in cox-1 with only a small deviation in regard its starting
position, due to the displacement of the helix fragment corresponding to residues 516–521 and the movement of side
chain of phe518 , showing that the side pocket is flexible
enough to accommodate the ligand.

4. discussion
3.6.1. docking of rofecoxib into the active site of cox-2
no crystal structure of the rofecoxib–cox complex is
available in the literature so far. the closest structure available at present, is the structure of the tricyclic ligand sc-558
complexed in cox-2 [16], that can be used as guide for
the present docking studies. in this structure, the phenyl
ring of the inhibitor fills the upper aromatic pocket and the
phenylsulphonamide moiety occupies the side pocket, with
the sulfonamide moiety resting close to arg513 . however,
since sc-558 lacks the furanone moiety of rofecoxib, which
could be responsible of extra interactions with different
residues of the active site, different starting structures of
the inhibitor/enzyme complex were investigated.
site directed mutagenesis studies suggest that arg513 is
a key residue for the affinity of the tricyclic inhibitors to
cox, whereas arg120 does not play any significant role in
this regard [20,24,25]. the crystal structure of sc-558 reveals that the interaction of the ligand with arg513 is mediated through the sulphone moiety. grid interaction energy
calculations [34,35] performed with a carbonyl oxygen and
a ester oxygen probes, respectively, indicate that both ser530
and arg120 are possible binding points of the furanone moiety of the ligand. accordingly, two different initial structures
were tried: (1) in model 1, the ester oxygen of the furanone

present models combine the structural information available of different nsaid bound to the cox binding site of
the two cox isozymes, together with the reported results of
key mutations on the enzymes, that modify or not the biological profile of different inhibitors. the analysis of these
models reveals differential binding modes among different
families of inhibitors and permits to sketch the main features responsible for ligand binding and selectivity for the
different isoforms of the enzyme.
the results of the present work suggest that there are
three key ligand–enzyme interactions, responsible for
non-selective cox inhibition: (i) a strong hydrogen bond
between a ligand carboxylate moiety and the side chain of
arg120 or between the pair tyr385 /ser530 ; (ii) a hydrogen
bond between a ligand accepting group that binds through
a hydrogen bond with the ser530 side chain and (iii) an
interaction between an aromatic ring that accommodates in
a hydrophobic pocket where tyr385 is located. the results
of the present models also reveal the importance of the
spatial arrangement of the required structural features in the
structure of the inhibitors. ligands are basically planar and
the different key moieties, can adequately be arranged by
using a planar scaffold that acts as spacer. in most of the

o. llorens et al. / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 20 (2002) 359–371

non-selective ligands, this spacer is a six-membered ring,
although  xxxd3563xxx  and indomethacin demonstrate that this
is not a requirement. moieties attached to the central scaffold are required to fulfil certain structural features for an
increased inhibitory profile. thus, the carboxyl moiety can
be in ortho, meta or para positions in regard to the other
aromatic moiety of the molecule. interestingly, this appears
to make a difference in the binding mode of the ligands. in
the case the carboxyl moiety is in ortho, ligands appear in
a bound orientation such that the carboxyl moiety interacts
with tyr385 . in contrast when the carboxyl moiety is in meta
or para, the ligand binds in such a way that the carboxyl
moiety forms a strong hydrogen bond with the arg120 side
chain. this feature was observed in the docking studies of
meclofenamic acid and diclofenac, and suggests that these
families of nsaids do not fulfill the same pharmacophore
requirements as the rest of non-selective inhibitors described
in the present work. first, the lack of effect on affinity of
the mutation arg120 to glu120 [25], clearly suggests that
these molecules bind in a different fashion than the arylacetic acid derivatives. moreover, the mutation of ser530
to ala530 [29] and to met530 [26] clearly reveal that these
two inhibitors are much sensitive to the presence of bulky
residues in the region close to ser530 than other nsaids.
these results clearly indicate that diclofenac and meclofenamic acid binding modes require to occupy a larger region
in the neighborhood of ser530 that is not required by other
nsaids. based on the models constructed in the present
work, the binding mode of these two inhibitors can be explained on the basis of the hydrogen bonding interaction
between the tyr385 side chain and the carboxylate moiety
of the ligands. the feasibility of this binding orientation is
supported by the recent x-ray diffraction structure of the
 xxxd208xxx  bound to cox-2 [38], where arachidonic
acid adopts a conformation that permits its carboxylate
moiety to lay close to the side chains of tyr385 and ser530
in a similar way as meclofenamic acid and diclofenac do.
models also reveal important structural features regarding the characteristics of the different moieties attached to
the central scaffold. thus, the relative spatial position of the
planes defined by the spacer and the aromatic ring is an important feature to be considered. models show that the angle
between the two planes should be around 30–40◦ for an improved ligand–enzyme interaction. this feature permits to
explain the reduced affinity exhibited by  xxxd446xxx . another
feature that modulates affinity is the proton accepting capability of the group that links the spacer and the aromatic
ring. the carbonyl appears to be the most suitable, being
the inhibitory potency lower for poorer proton accepting
groups. present models suggest this feature to be the reason
for the reduced inhibitory potency of fenoprofen. finally, a
methyl group near the carboxyl moiety with a stereoselectivity requirement appears to improve ligand affinity. thus,
when r-inhibitors are docked in the active site with the
carboxylate moiety resting close to arg120 , exhibit an steric
hindrance between the methyl group and the side chain

369

of ile/val523 . in contrast, s-inhibitors dispose their methyl
groups in a small hydrophobic pocket close to leu531 .
cox selectivity can be pursued by designing ligands
targeted to interact with the non-conserved residues of
the two enzymes. tricyclic inhibitors are designed to occupy the additional side pocket that extends off the cox
binding pocket. these ligands are larger than traditional
nsaids and take advantage of a polar interaction with the
non-conserved residue arg513 (his513 in cox-1), that rests
at the bottom of this lateral pocket of cox-2. furthermore,
in addition, to this difference there is a non-conserved
residue: val523 in cox-2 and ile523 in cox-1 strategically
located on the confluence of the side pocket and cox
binding site. both residues arg513 and val523 have been
demonstrated to be important for cox-2 selective inhibitor
binding [24]. the role of the first residue can be understood
from static models of rofecoxib, since it provides a polar
interaction to the ligand. however, the role of val523 cannot
clearly be elucidated from a static model. indeed, being
more voluminous in cox-1 produces a steric hindrance
that difficulties binding of the ligands to the lateral pocket
of cox-1, as recently identified by free energy perturbation calculations [42,43]. however, static models may not
represent accurately the binding of these inhibitors. present
results suggest that the lateral pocket in cox-1 appears to
be flexible enough to accommodate ligands at this site, as
demonstrated by the docking of  xxxd2423xxx  and rofecoxib
in cox-1. it is possible that in addition to steric reasons,
val523 acts as a modulator of the kinetic/dynamic behavior
of the ligands. indeed, tricyclic compounds are time dependent (irreversible) inhibitors of cox-2, and they also exhibit
a lower, but time independent (reversible) inhibition behavior in cox-1 [24]. the mutation val513 to ile513 in cox-2
changes the time dependent behavior of different tricyclic
inhibitors to a time independent behavior, and preserving
part of their inhibitory profile [22]. extensive molecular
modeling studies are required to further understand the
dynamics of the inhibition process and the structural rearrangements associated with these two types of inhibition.

5. conclusions
systematic docking of selective and non selective ligands
in the active site of both isozymes was undertaken, using
the available structural information together with site directed mutagenesis results reported in the literature. models
constructed show different features regarding the characterization of key structural motifs of ligands involved in
cox inhibition. several structural features are considered
to be important for efficient cox inhibition: (i) a carboxylate moiety that interacts with the arg120 side chain; (ii)
a carbonyl moiety that interacts via a hydrogen bond with
the side chain of ser530 and (iii) a distal aromatic ring
filling a hydrophobic pocket beneath the tyr385 side chain.
these three moieties need to be attached to a scaffold that

370

o. llorens et al. / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 20 (2002) 359–371

most commonly is a six-membered ring. however, present
results evidence a differential binding mode of the ligand,
depending on the relative position of the carboxyl and aromatic moieties on the scaffold. this observation could be
drawn after the analysis of the models of meclofenamic
acid or diclofenac when compared to those of  xxxd2423xxx 
or  xxxd3563xxx  this result conciliate and is supported by
different site directed mutagenesis studies reported in the
literature. present models also explore the possibility that
non-selective ligands bind also in a different orientation as
demonstrated for  xxxd2423xxx . this binding orientation could
be interpreted as an intermediate mode of binding for the
ligands in their way to the cox binding pocket.
selective cox-2 tricyclic inhibitor rofecoxib show a similar disposition when docked into the active site of both
isoenzymes. this is possible through a displacement of the
sulphone moiety and an induced fit of the helix that maintains phe518 at the same time in cox-2.
