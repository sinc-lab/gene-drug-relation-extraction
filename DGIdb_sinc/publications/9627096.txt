abstract.  xxxg1618xxx  has been shown to produce pharmacological effects both in brain and
periphery. several of these effects are mediated by a high-affinity  xxxg1618xxx  nti receptor. on
the other hand, a low-affinity  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive
 xxxg1618xxx  nt? receptor was molecularly
cloned from rodent brain recently. in this study, in contrast to nt1 receptor,  xxxd2469xxx  (a
histamine hi receptor antagonist) and sr48692 (an antagonist for nt1 receptor) strongly
stimulated intracellular c%+ mobilization in transfected chinese hamster ovary cells expressing
rat nt2 receptor, thus acting as potent nt2 receptor. furthermore, despite of their affinities for
nt2 receptor, the caz+ responses to potent nt1 agonists,  xxxg1618xxx  or jmv449 ([lysx(c&mi)-lysg]pro-tyr-ile-leu,
a peptidase resistant analogue of  xxxg1618xxx ) were much smaller
than that observed with sr48692. these findings suggest that nt1 and nt2 receptors present
distinct functional characteristics and that sr48692 may act as a potent agonist for nt? receptor.

introduction

the tridecqeptide  xxxg1618xxx , initially isolated from bovine hypothalamus (carraway and
beman, 1973), has been shown to produce pharmacological effects through membrane receptors
both in the central nervous system (cns) and periphery (rosttne et al., 1997). the.existence of
two distinct receptors for  xxxg1618xxx  have been proposed based on binding studies iii the rodent
brain (schotte et al., 1988). in the past few years, only one type of  xxxg1618xxx  receptor (nt1
receptor) which is insensitive to a histamine i-i1 receptor antagonist,  xxxd2469xxx , has been cloned
from rat (tanaka et al., 1990) and human (vita et al., 1993; watson et al., 1993). recently, a lowaffinity  xxxd2469xxx -sensitive
 xxxg1618xxx  receptor (nt2 receptor) was also cloned from rodent
brain (chalon et al., 1996; mazella et al., 1996). both nt1 and nt2 receptors belong to the superfamily of g-protein-coupled
receptors. a significant step toward evaluating the role of nt?
receptor would be to determine the second messenger systems which is functionally coupled to it.
it was previously demonstrated that the third intracellular (i-3) loop of nt1 receptor is important for
coupling to a g-protein mediating polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis (yamada et al, 1994), inducing
intracellular caz+ mobilization. since nt2 receptor has a longer putative i-3 loop with a low
homology to that of nt1 receptor, it was of great interest to see whether nt2 receptor is also linked
to ca2+ mobilization in response to  xxxg1618xxx  receptor agonists and antagonists. in this study,
we constructed a  xxxg1167xxx  line expressing the rat nt2 receptor and tested the ability of these substances
to modulate intracellular ca2+ mobilization. here we first demonstrate the distinct functional
characteristics of rat nt2 receptor expressed in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells.

results
[125i] xxxg1618xxx 
binding assay.
binding of [r2si] xxxg1618xxx  to rat nt2 receptor was specific and saturable. table 1. shows
the icso values and hill coefficients for  xxxg1618xxx , jmv449,  xxxd2469xxx  and sr48692 to
displace the [r2”i] xxxg1618xxx  bound to nt2 receptor. all the data fit well to a model for a single
population of receptors (hill coefficients were close to unity).
cho cells.
measurement of intracellular caz+ concentration in fura-2-loaded
intracellular ca2+ mobilization was not detected in cho cells before transfection with any
of the drugs challenged in this study. interestingly, despite of their good affinities for nt2
receptor,  xxxg1618xxx  (1, 10 or 100 nm) and jmv449 (1 or 10 nm) did not stimulate nt:! receptor
mediated caz+ mobilization. only with higher concentrations of  xxxg1618xxx  (1 pm) and jmv449
(100 nm), ca2+ responses (peak height of 193 2 6 or 188 2 18 nm, respectively) were observed in
a significantly low number of responding cells (below 9 % of total cells examined). fig. la-b
represents the example of the typical time course of intracellular caz+ concentrations in a few
responding cells following application of 1 ,um  xxxg1618xxx  (a) and 100 nm jmv449 (b).
on the other hand, sr48692 and  xxxd2469xxx  dramatically induced nt2 receptor mediated
ca2+ mobilization in a dose-dependent manner. as illustrated in fig. 1c and fig. 2d, sr48692 (1
pm) or  xxxd2469xxx  (100 nm) induced a rapid rise in intracellular caz+ concentration in about 50
% of the cells examined with a peak height of 244 + 8 nm and 224 +: 9 nm, respectively. as shown
in fig. 2a-d, with higher concentrations of sr48692, the amplitude of the response was increased
concomitantly with a advanced appearance of the peaks. similar dose-dependent
event was
observed for  xxxd2469xxx  (data not shown). the calculated ec50 values were 104 nm and 79 nm
for sr48692 and  xxxd2469xxx , respectively. in the present study, the caz+ responses with similar
maximal levels by sr48692 and  xxxd2469xxx  were also observed under extracellular ca2+-free
conditions (data not shown).

discussion

in this study, we constructed a mammalian cell line expressing rat nt? receptor and tested
the ability of  xxxg1618xxx  receptor ligands to stimulate intracellular ca2+ mobilization. it was
previously demonstrated that  xxxg1618xxx  dramatically stimulated intracellular ca2+ mobilization in
cho cells expressing rat nt1 receptor (hermans et al., 1995). in the present study, despite of
their good affinities for nt? receptor, ca2+ responses to  xxxg1618xxx  or jmv44y were not obvious.
ca2+ responses were observed in a significantly low number of responding cells (below y % of
total cells examined, fig. la-b), only with higher concentrations of these drugs. our findings may
suggest that  xxxg1618xxx  and jmv449 are not full agonists for nt2 receptor or ca2+ responses by
these drugs are due to the promiscuous stimulation. the difference in the expression levels of nt2
receptor may affect the cell response to its ligands. the cell cycle also may affect the expression
levels of this receptor. however, antibody has to be available to check the expression of the
receptor at a single cell level. other explanation is that the endogenous  xxxg1618xxx  may stimulate
other second messenger system(s) which would be coupled to nt:! receptor. since nt2 receptor
has a longer putative i-3 loop supposed to be important for signal transduction with a low
homology to that of nt1 receptor, the distinct structure of i-3 loop of nt? receptor may explain
this functional nonequivalence
to ntr receptor. interestingly, the nt] antagonist sr48692
dramatically induced nt2 receptor mediated caz+ mobilization in a dose-dependent manner.
intracellular c$+ mobilization was not detected in cho cells transfected with vector alone or
before transfection, clearly demonstrating that this effect is specifically related to this compound.
the ca2+ mobilization was also not detected in cho cells expressing rat  xxxg1618xxx  nt1 receptor
after stimulation with sr48692. in the present study,  xxxd2469xxx  also induced nt2 receptor
mediated c?a2+mobilization. this effect of  xxxd2469xxx  on rat nt:! receptor can be related to a
recent work showing that this drug may evoke a  xxxg162xxx  on xenopus

oocyte injected with mouse nt2 receptor crna (mazella et al., 1996). in the present study, the
ca2+ responses were also observed under extracellular ca 2+-free conditions, suggesting that the
effects of sr48692 and  xxxd2469xxx  were initiated by the release of ca2+ from intracellular stores.
previously, we demonstrated the different distribution of nt1 and nt2 receptor in the rat brain
(kitabgi et al., 1987) and that  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptor may be associated with glial population in
the rat striatum (schotte et al., 1988); in contrast, a majority of nt1 receptor are associated with
presynaptic terminals of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in this region of the brain (schotte
et al., 1988; yamada et al., 1995; boudin et al., 1996). together with our present molecular
observations, these findings suggest that the physiological functions of  xxxg1618xxx  nt:! receptor in
cns are distinct from that of nt1 receptor. furthermore, since endogenous compound which can
stimulate nt2 receptor is not known at this time point, our findings may suggest the existence of
possible yet unknown endogenous agonists for nt;! receptor.
in conclusion, we demonstrate that the rat  xxxg1618xxx  nt2 receptor has distinct functional
characteristics than nt1 receptor in respect to caz+ response to neirrotensin receptor ligands.
though the physiological importance of intracellular c?a2+mobilization induced by sr48692 and
 xxxd2469xxx  remains to be elucidated, the present findings give new insights to understand the
various central effects of  xxxg1618xxx  which have been reported previously (rosttne et al., 1997).
the development of new agonists or antagonists with high selectivity for either nt1 or nt:!
receptor would thus be of a great interest.
