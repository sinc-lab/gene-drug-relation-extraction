abstract
the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of sodium bicarbonate on the physicochemical properties of controlled release hotmelt extruded (hme) tablets containing eudragit® rs po and/or eudragit® e po.  xxxd66xxx  and chlorpheniramine maleate were
used as model drugs. sodium bicarbonate was incorporated into the tablet formulations and the drug release properties and buoyancy in media for
hme tablets and directly compressed (dc) tablets were investigated. the hme tablets prepared from the powder blend containing both eudragit®
rs po and sodium bicarbonate exhibited sustained release properties and the tablets floated on the surface of the media for 24 h. the crosssectional morphology of the hme tablets showed a porous structure since co2 gas was generated due to the thermal decomposition of sodium
bicarbonate in the softened acrylic polymers at elevated temperature during the extrusion process. in contrast, all dc tablets prepared in this study
showed no buoyancy and rapid drug release in the dissolution media. the drug release rate from floating hme tablets was controlled by both the
incorporation of eudragit® e po into the matrix tablet and the diameter of the die used in the extrusion equipment. the drug release profiles and
buoyancy of the floating hme tablets were stable when stored at 40 °c/75%rh for 3 months.

1. introduction
in the human body, the residence time of an administrated
dosage form in the stomach is generally short due to rapid
gastric emptying. the presence of food will significantly
influence the gastric emptying time (get). for healthy human
subjects, the get has been reported to be approximately 0.5–
2.0 h [1–4]. the get may increase [2,3] or decrease [4] under
certain disease conditions. for drugs that act locally such as
 xxxd66xxx , a longer residence time in the stomach is
desired [5–7]. therapeutic efficacy of drugs that are well
absorbed in the stomach or the upper part of the intestinal tract
(duodenum, jejunum) such as ciprofloxacin [8] and sotalol hcl

[9] may be increased with a longer residence time. in addition,
the bioavailability of drugs that are unstable in the intestinal
fluid such as captopril [10], as well as drugs that exhibit poor
solubility in the intestinal tract such as diazepam [11] and
 xxxd3504xxx  [12], could be increased by extending the drug
residence time in the stomach.
several technologies have been used to achieve floating
dosage forms for the purpose of extending drug residence time in
the stomach. kawashima et al. [13,14] and sato et al. [15,16]
prepared floating microspheres using an emulsion solvent
diffusion method with enteric acrylic polymers and then investigated their pharmacological properties in humans [17,18].
streubel et al. [19] investigated a floating drug delivery system
consisting of a low-density polypropylene foam powder and
matrix-forming polymers. nakamichi et al. [20] prepared a
gastric floating dosage form using the puff ability at the die of a
twin-screw extruder. wei et al. [21] studied the properties of
floating tablets containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and
sodium bicarbonate. the co2 gas generated when tablets

containing sodium bicarbonate were immersed in simulated
gastric fluid rendered the tablets buoyant. however, a potential
problem with this system is that the tablet could rapidly exit the
stomach before becoming buoyant since the device cannot float
immediately after administration and its buoyancy will be
influenced by fluctuations in the ph of the gastric fluids. in fact,
it has been reported that the gastric ph elevates to approximately
5 during a meal [22]. furthermore, the fasted gastric ph for an
achlorhydric subject has been reported to be approximately 7
[22]; thus, for such patients, this system would not provide
adequate therapy.
the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of
sodium bicarbonate on the physicochemical properties of controlled release hot-melt extruded (hme) tablets containing
eudragit® rs po and/or eudragit® e po in order to achieve a
rapid and ph independent floating systems. eudragit® rs po
is a powder grade of a methacrylic copolymer with trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate in which the molar ratio of the
quaternary ammonium groups to the neutral ester groups is
approximately 1:40. this polymer is widely used as a retardant
in controlled release drug delivery systems. dosage forms containing eudragit® rs po are produced predominantly by wet
granulation [23], powder coating [24], and hot-melt extrusion
methods. zhu et al. [25] and kidokoro et al. [26] reported that
eudragit® rs po functions to retard drug release when melt
extruded at a temperature above its glass transition temperature
(tg). eudragit® e po is a powder grade of a methacrylic copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and other
neutral methacrylic acid esters. this polymer is used for protective coatings and taste-masking [27] since it dissolves quickly
via salt formation with acids in the stomach. in our study,
 xxxd66xxx  (aha) and chlorpheniramine maleate
(cpm) were used as model drugs.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
 xxxd66xxx  (aha) was purchased from sigma
aldrich chemical co. (st. louis, mo). chlorpheniramine
maleate (cpm) was obtained from spectrum chemical (gardena,
ca). both aha and cpm were passed through a 250 mum screen
prior to use. sodium bicarbonate was purchased from fisher

scientific (fair lawn, nj).  xxxd3212xxx  anhydrous was
purchased from acros organics (morris plains, nj). eudragit®
rs po and eudragit® e po were donated by röhm america inc.
(piscataway, nj). microcrystalline cellulose (mcc; avicel® ph101) was supplied by fmc corp. (newark, de). glyceryl
monostearate (gms) was purchased from sasol germany gmbh
(witten, germany).
2.2. preparation of floating hot-melt extruded (hme) tablets
the tablet formulations used in the current study are shown in
table 1. a powder mixture (200 g) of each formulation containing
either aha or cpm as the model drug, eudragit® rs po and/or
eudragit® e po as retardants, gms as a thermal lubricant,
sodium bicarbonate and/or mcc was first blended using a v-shell
blender (p-k blend master, patterson-kelley co., east stroudsburg, pa) for 15 min. the blended powder was then placed in the
hopper of a single-screw randcastle extruder (model rc 0750,
cedar grove, nj) and extruded. the extrusion temperatures for
zone 1, zone 2, zone 3, and zone 4 (die) were 90, 95, 100, and
100 °c, respectively. the screw rotation speed was 10 rpm and the
die diameter was 6 mm. to study the influence of die diameter on
drug release, diameters of 1 and 3 mm were also used. the
processing time was approximately 3 min for all formulations.
after melt processing, the extrudates were allowed to cool at room
temperature for at least 48 h and then manually cut into tablets.
the extrudates prepared using the 1 mm diameter die were cut
using a randcastle pelletizer (model rcp-2.0) and subsequently
sieved. the fraction collected between 1.0 mm and 1.4 mm
screens was used for further study.
2.3. preparation of directly compressed (dc) tablets
in order to investigate the effects of the hot-melt extrusion
processing on drug release and buoyancy, the dc tablets were
prepared by the following procedure. a 200 g powder mixture
containing 10% drug, 65% eudragit® rs po, 10% mcc, 10%
sodium bicarbonate, and 5% gms (formulations 2 and 5 in
table 1) was blended using a v-shell blender for 15 min. the
blended powder (300 mg) was compressed at the pressure of
2000 kg for 3 s using a hydraulic compactor (fred s. carver inc.,
menomonee falls, wi) equipped with flat-punches of 10 mm
diameter.

2.4. modulated differential scanning calorimetry (mdsc)

2.8. tablet density

to investigate the plasticization effect of the model drug on
the glass transition temperature (tg) of eudragit® rs po, a ta
instruments model 2920 (new castle, de) was used in
temperature modulation mode. a sample of approximately
10 mg was sealed in an aluminum pan and heated at 5 °c/min
with an amplitude of ± 1 °c/min from −20 °c to 100 °c under
an ultra-high pure nitrogen purge at a flow rate of 150 ml/min.
the samples were cycled twice. the tg was calculated as the
midpoint of the transition.

the density (d) of hme tablets was calculated from tablet
height, diameter, and weight using the following equation
(eq. (1)) [19].

here, m is the diameter of a tablet, pi is the circular constant, h is
the height of a tablet, and w is the weight of a tablet. all
measurements were performed in six replicates. the averages
and standard deviations were calculated and reported.

2.5. powder x-ray diffraction (xrd)
the crystalline thermal transformation of sodium bicarbonate
in an oven and the crystalline states of drug and sodium
bicarbonate in physical mixtures and extrudates were investigated using a pw 1720 x-ray generator and a pw 1710 diffractometer control (philips electronic instrument, mount
vernon, ny) with ni filtered cukalpha line as the source of
radiation. the voltage and current were set to 40 kv and 40 ma,
respectively. the scanning range (2theta) was from 5 to 35°, and the
scan was performed with a step rise of 0.04° (2theta) and a dwell
time of 1.0 s at each step. x-ray patterns were analyzed using
jade 5 xrd pattern processing software (materials data inc.,
irvine, ca).
for the crystalline thermal transformation study, sodium
bicarbonate (2 g) was weighed in an aluminum dish, placed in the
oven, and equilibrated at 100 °c for 15, 30, 60, 180, and 360 min
in order to investigate the crystalline thermal transformation from
sodium bicarbonate to  xxxd3212xxx  anhydrous.
the extrudates were ground into a fine powder using a
mortar and pestle for 15 s to investigate the crystalline states of
drug and sodium bicarbonate in extrudates.
2.6. scanning electron microscopy (sem)
the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of nonfloating (formulation 4) and floating (formulation 5) hme
tablets were compared using a philips model 515 scanning
electron microscope at 17 kv accelerating voltage. images were
captured using a semicaps 2000a imaging system. samples
were mounted onto brass stages using double-sided adhesive
tape and coated with gold–palladium for 60 s under an argon
atmosphere using a ladd sputter coater (ladd research
industries inc., burlington, vt).

2.9. in vitro drug release
in vitro drug release testing from tablets was conducted
according to the usp 27 apparatus 2 specifications using a
varian vk 7000 dissolution tester equipped with a van kel
autosampler vk 8000 (van kel industries, edison, nj). the
dissolution media used for release testing of aha was 900 ml of
0.01n hcl following usp 27 since the aha released from
tablets was not stable under the strong acidic condition of 0.1n
hcl for long periods. the dissolution testing for cpm was
conducted in 900 ml of 0.1n hcl. during dissolution testing, the
media were maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °c and agitated at 100 rpm. a
sample volume of 3 ml was taken at time points of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h. to determine the concentration of
aha in the samples, 1 ml of each sample was added to 1 ml of
ferric chloride solution (dissolved 400 mg of ferric chloride in
100 ml of 0.01n hcl) because the uv absorption of aha is too
low to detect alone with a uv spectrometer (muquant, biotek® instruments, inc., winooski, vt). the wavelength of the
uv spectrometer for aha was 502 nm. the concentration of
cpm in samples was determined using a uv spectrometer at
261 nm. the data were collected using kc4 version 3.1
software (bio-tek® instruments, inc., winooski, vt). all
dissolution tests were performed in triplicate.
2.10. stability
the floating hme tablets prepared from formulation 13 were
stored at 40 °c and 75% relative humidity (40 °c/75%rh) in
both opened and closed (aluminum induction sealed) highdensity polyethylene (hdpe) bottles for 3 months. the cpm
release profiles and buoyancy in 0.1n hcl of stored tablets
were compared with the initial data.

2.7. buoyancy
3. results and discussion
the buoyancy of tablets was determined using the paddle
method at a rotation speed of 100 rpm with a varian vk 7000
dissolution tester (varian, inc., cary, nc) in 900 ml of either
0.1n hcl, 0.1n hcl containing 0.1 m nacl, or deionized
water at 37 °c for 24 h. the state of the tablets during buoyancy testing was checked visually each hour for 12 h and at
the end point of 24 h. all buoyancy tests were performed in
triplicate.

3.1. crystalline thermal transformation of sodium bicarbonate
sodium bicarbonate has an interesting thermal property in
that it decomposes to co2 gas,  xxxd3212xxx  and water at
temperatures above 50 °c [28]. the crystalline thermal transformation of sodium bicarbonate in the oven equilibrated at
100 °c, which is the same temperature as the hot-melt extrusion

124

m. fukuda et al. / journal of controlled release 115 (2006) 121–129

suggesting that cpm and eudragit® rs po are miscible and
cpm functions as a plasticizer for eudragit® rs po. however, it
was found that aha had no distinct plasticization effect on tg of
eudragit® rs po (data not shown), suggesting that aha was
immiscible with eudragit® rs po.
3.3. crystalline states of cpm and sodium bicarbonate in
extrudates

process in this study, was investigated using xrd. the xrd
patterns are shown in fig. 1. the crystalline state of sodium
bicarbonate gradually transformed to the anhydrous sodium
carbonate form with time. when stored at 100 °c for 180 min, a
peak at 18.3° (2theta), which corresponds to sodium bicarbonate,
was not observed suggesting complete thermal transformation to
 xxxd3212xxx . these finding are in agreement
with shefter et al. [29], who reported that approximately 90% of
sodium bicarbonate crystals transformed to anhydrous sodium
carbonate after 75 min at 93 °c.

the crystalline states of cpm and sodium bicarbonate in the
physical mixture and in the hot-melt extrudate of formulation 5
are shown in the diffraction profiles of fig. 3. with the xrd
pattern of the physical mixture, crystals of cpm and sodium
bicarbonate were observed to a slight extent. the crystalline
peaks for cpm at 19.2° (2theta) and 20.2° (2theta) were not observed in
the extrudate, indicating cpm was present in the amorphous
state in softened eudragit® rs po. a peak at 18.3° (2theta) for
sodium bicarbonate also disappeared in the xrd pattern of the
hot-melt extrudate, suggesting that the sodium bicarbonate was
transformed to  xxxd3212xxx  during the extrusion
process.
3.4. incorporation of sodium bicarbonate into the formulation
for the hme tablets
3.4.1. drug release properties and buoyancy
the influence of sodium bicarbonate on the release of aha
and cpm from hme tablets was investigated. fig. 4 shows the
comparison of the drug release profiles of aha in 0.01n hcl
from hme tablets prepared from the formulation containing
either 10% sodium bicarbonate (formulation 2) or without

3.2. effect of drug level on the glass transition temperature
(tg ) of eudragit® rs po
the influence of drug level on the tg of eudragit® rs po was
investigated using mdsc (fig. 2). on the first run, the tg of
eudragit® rs po was not affected by the increase in cpm level
in eudragit® rs po since cpm and eudragit® rs po were
physically mixed. on the second run, the tg of eudragit® rs po
significantly decreased with increasing cpm levels (up to 20%),

than 1.0 g/cm3, suggesting that the hme tablets would indeed
float.

fig. 4. drug release profiles from floating and non-floating hme tablets
prepared by formulations 1, 2, 4, and 5 in 900 ml of either 0.01 n hcl (aha) or
0.1 n hcl (cpm) at 37 ± 0.5 °c (usp 27 apparatus 2, 100 rpm). each point
represents the mean ± standard deviation, n = 3.

sodium bicarbonate (formulation 1). the incorporation of
sodium bicarbonate into the tablet formulation was shown to
have no significant influence on the drug release rate. for
buoyancy testing, hme tablets prepared from formulation 2
containing 10% sodium bicarbonate floated on the surface of all
media (0.1n hcl, 0.1n hcl containing 0.1 m nacl, and
deionized water) for 24 h, whereas hme tablets prepared from
the formulation without sodium bicarbonate (formulation 1)
showed no buoyancy.
the influence of sodium bicarbonate on the release of cpm
from hme tablets was also investigated (fig. 4). when sodium
bicarbonate was incorporated into the formulation, the tablets
were buoyant, as seen with the hme tablets containing aha.
however, the cpm release rate from hme tablets prepared
according to formulation 5 containing sodium bicarbonate was
significantly faster than hme tablets prepared without sodium
bicarbonate (formulation 4). interestingly, both the release rates
of aha and cpm from the floating hme tablets (formulations
2 and 5) were very similar, while the drug release rates from
non-floating hme tablets prepared without sodium bicarbonate
(formulations 1 and 4) were dependent on the model drug. this
could be explained by the difference in the plasticization effects
of the model drugs on the acrylic polymer. as described above,
it was found that cpm functioned as a plasticizer for eudragit®
rs po, whereas no distinct plasticizing effect of aha was
observed. since, in general, the drug release property from
matrix tablets is affected by the incorporation of a plasticizer, it
was concluded that the difference in the aha and cpm release
profiles from non-floating hme tablets (formulations 1 and 4)
was due to the difference in the plasticization effects of the
model drugs on the retardant polymer. on the other hand, the
cpm release from floating hme tablets was faster than nonfloating hme tablets. this result suggested that the plasticizing
effect of cpm did not function in the porous matrices, resulting
in the increase in cpm release rate.
the densities of hme tablets prepared from formulations 1,
2, 4, and 5 were 1.179, 0.654, 1.173, and 0.813 g/cm3,
respectively (table 2). when sodium bicarbonate was added to
the hme tablet formulations, the density of the tablets was less

3.4.2. influence of sodium bicarbonate levels on the aha
release properties and the density of hme tablets
in order to investigate the influence of sodium bicarbonate
levels on aha release and the density of hme tablets, 0%, 5%,
or 10% sodium bicarbonate was incorporated into the tablet
formulations (formulations 1–3). in the case of hme tablets
containing aha as a model drug, no significant effect of
sodium bicarbonate on drug release properties was observed
(data not shown). the densities of hme tablets prepared from
formulations 1–3 were 1.179, 0.654, and 0.657 g/cm 3 ,
respectively. the tablet density of hme tablets prepared from
the formulation containing either 5% or 10% sodium bicarbonate (formulations 2 and 3) was almost the same, and both tablets
floated in 0.1n hcl, 0.1n hcl containing 0.1 m nacl, and
deionized water for 24 h, as well as in the dissolution medium
(0.01n hcl). these results suggested that the hme tablets
showed sufficient buoyancy even when only 5% sodium
bicarbonate was incorporated into the tablet formulation.
3.4.3. morphologies of floating hme tablets and non-floating
hme tablets
to describe the morphological differences between nonfloating (formulation 4) and floating (formulation 5) hme
tablets, the surface and cross-sectional morphologies were
observed using sem. the cross-sectional morphology of the
non-floating hme tablets was observed to be a non-porous
structure and the surface of the tablets was very smooth (fig. 5).
in contrast, the floating hme tablets were observed to be
porous structures on examination of the cross-sectional
morphology, due to the evolution of co2 gas attributable to
the thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate in softened
eudragit® rs po during the extrusion process (fig. 6). the
internal pore size of the floating hme tablets was approximately 200 mum in diameter.

(b) surface 200×, (c) cross-sectional 50×, and (d) cross-sectional 200×.

3.5. drug release properties and buoyancy for dc tablets
to investigate the effects of the hot-melt extrusion processing on the drug release properties and buoyancy, dc tablets
were prepared from formulations 2 and 5. a comparison of the
drug release rates from floating hme tablets and dc tablets is
shown in fig. 7. both aha and cpm released rapidly from dc
tablets and no significant buoyancy during dissolution testing
was observed, despite both eudragit® rs po and sodium
bicarbonate being present in the dc tablets. these results
suggest that the floating and sustained release properties of the
hme tablets were due to the thermal properties of both sodium
bicarbonate and eudragit® rs po and the effects of the hotmelt extrusion process.
3.6. influence of drug levels on the drug release properties of
floating hme tablets
in order to investigate the influence of drug levels on the
drug release properties of floating hme tablets, 10–30% cpm
was incorporated into the tablets (formulations 5–7) and the
drug release properties of tablets were compared (fig. 8). the
drug release rate from floating hme tablets tended to increase
with an increase in the drug level. when 30% cpm was present

in the tablet, and when the eudragit® rs po level in a tablet
decreased from 65% to 55%, the cpm release rate increased
significantly. this increase was attributed to the decrease in the
level of eudragit® rs po in the tablet since no significant effect
on the drug release profiles was observed when 10–20% cpm
was present in the tablet. these results suggested that the drug
level in the floating hme tablets exhibited no influence on the
drug release properties.
3.7. control of the drug release rate by the incorporation of
eudragit® e po
3.7.1. drug release and tablet density
to control the drug release rate from floating hme tablets,
0–65% eudragit® e po was incorporated into the tablet
formulations (formulations 8–11). the cpm release rate from
hme tablets increased with increasing eudragit® e po levels
(fig. 9) since eudragit® e po is soluble in gastric fluid.
however, when eudragit® rs po and eudragit® e po occupied 75% (w/w) of the tablet, the buoyancy tended to decrease due to an increase in tablet density. as shown in table 2,

1.0 g/cm3. in fact, the hme tablets prepared from formulations
8 and 11 did not float in 0.1n hcl investigated for buoyancy
testing during the first 3 min. after 3 min, both tablets floated on
the surface of the media for 24 h. this could be due to trace
amounts of the sodium bicarbonate in the hme tablets that were
not thermal decomposed during the extrusion processing
resulting in the formation of co2 gas in acidic media, causing
the tablets to float on the media surface. in addition, the tablet
density could also be decreased slightly due to the dissolution or
erosion of a small amount of either cpm, excipients or acrylic
polymers during the first 3 min. furthermore, the densities of
hme tablets prepared from formulations 9 and 10 were 0.965
and 0.963 g/cm3, respectively, suggesting that the tablet density
tended to approach 1.0 g/cm3 when the concentration of acrylic
polymers in the hme tablet was 75% (w/w).
3.7.2. influence of mcc on the tablet density
when the concentration of acrylic polymers in the tablet
formulation was elevated to 75% (w/w), the tablet density
increased. this was due to the high density of the extrudates of
acrylic polymers which prevented the formation of a porous
structure during extrusion with sodium bicarbonate. to decrease
the density of the hme tablets, 10% eudragit® rs po was
replaced in the formulation with mcc since an insoluble
excipient like mcc would be immiscible with acrylic polymers.

the density of hme tablets was decreased by the incorporation
of mcc into the tablets. as shown in table 2, when 10% mcc
was present in a tablet (formulations 5, 12, and 13), the densities
of hme tablets prepared from formulations 8, 9, and 10
decreased from 1.062, 0.965, and 0.963 g/cm3 to 0.813, 0.756,
and 0.844 g/cm3, respectively.
these results suggested that the drug release rate from
floating hme tablets was controlled by the incorporation of
eudragit® e po, and mcc was an effective excipient for
increasing the buoyancy of floating hme tablets.
3.8. influence of surface area on drug release properties
3.8.1. tablet size
to investigate the influence of tablet size on buoyancy and
the drug release properties, extrudates prepared from formulation 5 were manually cut into tablets weighing approximately
100, 200, and 300 mg. all tablets floated on the surface of the
media during dissolution testing. the cpm release rate from
100 mg tablets was faster than both the 200 and 300 mg tablets,
while those from 200 and 300 mg tablets were very similar
(data not shown). this could be attributable to the increase in
the ratio of cross-sectional area to tablet surface area. the
percentage of cross-sectional area to tablet surface area of a
tablet for 100, 200, and 300 mg tablets was 63.5%, 46.5%, and

size on the drug release properties and buoyancy of extrudates.
the cpm release rate increased with decreasing die diameter,
due to the increase in the surface area of the samples (fig. 10).
all extrudates prepared from the three different dies floated
on the surface of all media for buoyancy testing for 24 h. when
a 1 mm diameter die was set to an extruder and the extrudates
were cut using a pelletizer, the samples were porous granules.
interestingly, none of the granules sank in all media over 24 h,
as well as the extrudates prepared using 3 and 6 mm diameter
dies. this result suggested that the buoyancy of extrudates
prepared from formulation 5 containing both eudragit® rs po
and sodium bicarbonate was not influenced by the size of the die
even when the sample was prepared as a granule. the cpm
release rate, however, was a function of the die size for the
extrusion process.

extrusion process were used to investigate the influence of die

investigated at 40 °c/75%rh in both opened and closed hdpe
bottles for 3 months. the cpm release rate from the floating

not shown). for buoyancy testing, the tablets stored in both

opened and closed hdpe bottles for 3 months floated on the
surface of the media (0.1n hcl, 0.1n hcl containing 0.1 m
nacl, and deionized water) for 24 h. furthermore, xrd data
demonstrated that no recrystallization of cpm occurred during
storage (data not shown). thus, it was found that the floating
hme tablets prepared from the formulation containing both
sodium bicarbonate and acrylic polymers were stable under
these storage conditions for at least 3 months.
4. conclusions
the hme tablets prepared from powder blend containing
sodium bicarbonate and eudragit® rs po were shown to be
buoyant in the media and to possess sustained release
properties. the drug release rate from floating hme tablets
was controlled by both the incorporation of eudragit® e po into
the matrix tablet and the die size for the extrusion process.
the porous internal tablet morphology that contributed to
buoyancy was formed by utilizing the evolution of co2 gas
attributable to the thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate
in softened acrylic polymers, which occurs during hot-melt
extrusion processing.
