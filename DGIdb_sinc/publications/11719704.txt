heptachlor is a persistent cyclodiene pesticide that affects
gabaergic function. recent reports indicate that heptachlor exposure also alters  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) expression and
function in adult mice. the aim of this study was to determine
whether gestational, perinatal, and/or adolescent heptachlor exposure in rats altered dopamine-receptor and dat binding. adolescent exposure to dieldrin was included to evaluate the generality of
the findings. sprague-dawley rats received doses (po) ranging
from 0 to 8.4 mg/kg/day of heptachlor, or dieldrin, 3 mg/kg/day,
during different developmental periods. there were dose-related
decreases in maternal weight gain and pup survival, as well as
delayed righting reflex, at heptachlor doses >3 mg/kg/day. there
were no changes in striatal dopamine receptor-d1 ([ 3h]sch23390) and -d2 ([ 3h]spiperone) binding in preweanling pups exposed perinatally to heptachlor, and no differences in the response
of adult rats to the motor activity-increasing effects of d-amphetamine. however, there were significant (27– 64%) increases in
striatal dat binding of [ 3h] xxxd2546xxx  in preweanling rats exposed
only gestationally. in rats exposed perinatally and/or during adolescence, there were also increases (34 – 65%) in striatal dat
binding at postnatal days (pnd) 22, 43, and 128. adolescent
exposure to dieldrin also increased dat binding. in other rats
exposed perinatally and throughout adolescence, even the lowest
dose of heptachlor 0.3 mg/kg/d increased dat binding on pnd
130. the dat affinity for  xxxd2546xxx  was unchanged in heptachlorexposed striata. in vitro binding studies indicated that heptachlor
(>10 ␮m) displaced  xxxd2546xxx  binding. thus, gestational, perinatal, and/or adolescent exposure to heptachlor produced an increase
in dat binding as early as pnd 10, and this change persisted into
adulthood.

heptachlor is a cyclodiene organochloride that was used as
a pesticide for more than 30 years until its ban in the mid1980s. heptachlor and its metabolite, heptachlor epoxide, have
persisted in the environment for years (fendick et al., 1990).
incidents of high pesticide exposure have been reported; for
example; in 1981– 82, heptachlor epoxide contaminated a considerable part of hawaii’s milk supply (smith, 1982). this has
led to concern that adverse health effects might have resulted
from consumption of contaminated dairy products, especially
in those exposed in utero and/or as children. however, little is
known regarding the impact of these exposures, or how heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide might influence the development of the central nervous system. one recent study showed
that developing rats exposed to heptachlor exhibited developmental delays and alterations in adult cognitive function
(moser et al., 2001). since heptachlor and other cyclodienes
are persistent and bioaccumulate, additional studies are needed
to identify potential long-term health effects of these exposures.
a large etiologic study of world war ii veteran twins over
the age of 65 failed to indicate any genetic component to
parkinson’s disease (pd) when the disease begins after age 50
(tanner et al., 1999). these findings suggested that environmental factors may play a role in this disease, and recent
epidemiological studies indicate that pesticide exposure is a
risk factor for pd (priyadarshi et al., 2000). for example, one
study showed a significant increase in mortality from pd in
california counties with extensive agricultural pesticide use
(ritz and yu, 2000). in other studies, analysis of postmortem
human brain tissue showed a significantly greater concentration of dieldrin, another cyclodiene pesticide, in pd brains than
in either control or alzheimer diseased brains (corrigan et al.,
2000; fleming et al., 1994). thus, there is a growing concern
that exposure to pesticides, and particularly to cyclodienes,
may play a role in the onset of pd (priyadarshi et al., 2000).
the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) normally functions to allow rapid uptake of dopamine (da) and therefore is important
in regulating da actions (fischman et al., 1998; giros and
caron, 1993). dat binding decreases with age and is addi-

tionally decreased due to neuronal loss in pd (fischman et al.,
1998; frost et al., 1993; madras et al., 1998; seibyl et al.,
1997). the dat may also play an important role in neuronal
development, appearing first at gestational day (gd) 14. in
dat knockout mice, d1 and d2 da receptors and preproenkephalin a mrna levels were decreased from gd 14 on,
while dynorphin mrna levels were increased from gd 17 on
(fauchey et al., 2000). thus, changes in dat number and da
levels may affect neuronal development early on, and may play
a role in the etiology of pd later in life.
a direct link between heptachlor and the dopaminergic
system has been reported (kirby et al., 2001; miller et al.,
1999b). striatal da uptake was increased in adult mice given
injections of heptachlor (6 –12 mg/kg, 3 times over 2 weeks,
intraperitoneally), as measured by the rate of [ 3h]-dopamine
uptake as well as western-blot analyses of striatal synaptosomes using monoclonal dat antibodies. these data led to the
question of whether repeated exposure to lower doses of heptachlor would produce similar effects (1) in rats, and (2)
following developmental exposure. several ongoing behavioral studies allowed access to brain tissues with which to
examine these questions. the hypothesis was that developmental exposure to heptachlor would alter dat binding, and, as a
consequence, would affect da function as evidenced by
changes in receptor density. thus, ligand binding to da receptors and the dat were examined at various times during
and after exposure.
materials and methods
animals. pregnant female sprague-dawley rats were obtained from
charles river laboratories, inc. (raleigh, nc). all litters were culled (4
males, 4 females) on postnatal day (pnd) 7, and weaned on pnd 21. rats
were housed on hardwood chips (pregnant dams) or heat-treated pine shavings
(postweanling and adult rats). they were given free access to food (purina
rodent chow 5001, or 5008 for pregnant dams) and tap water, and maintained
at 72 ⫾ 2°f, 50 ⫾ 10% humidity, and a 12-h light cycle.
four separate groups of animals (summarized in table 1) were dosed with
heptachlor by oral gavage (2 ml/kg for preweanling rats, 1 ml/kg for all others).
in the perinatal study (group 1), pregnant dams (10/dose; 0, 4.2, or 8.4
mg/kg/day) were dosed (5 days/week) from mid-gestation through one week
after delivery, and thereafter pups were directly dosed until weaning. in group

2, pregnant dams (9/dose; 0, 4.2, or 8.4 mg/kg/day) were dosed (5 days/week)
only during gestation. in a perinatal/adolescent study (group 3), pregnant dams
(10/heptachlor dose [0.3, 3 mg/kg/day], 20 controls) were dosed as in group
1, except that the pups were dosed until pnd 42. to examine effects of early
adolescent exposure, half of the control litters (which had been dosed with
vehicle until pnd 21) were dosed with 3 mg/kg/day on pnd 21– 42. in another
perinatal/adolescent study (group 4), pregnant dams (5/dose; 0, 0.3, 1, or 3
mg/kg/day) were dosed (7 days/week) until lactational day 7, and all pups were
dosed on pnd 7– 42.
yet another group was dosed (7 days/week) on pnd 21– 42 with corn oil or
dieldrin 5 mg/kg/day (1 ml/kg); this dose was lowered to 3 mg/kg/day after 3
days, due to unexpected toxicity.
behavioral testing. all pups in all litters of the first 3 groups were
evaluated for the development of the righting reflex. each pup was placed on
its back, and the amount of time required for the pup to right itself (all 4 paws
flat on the surface) was measured using a stopwatch, with a maximum of 30 s.
this testing took place on pnd 2–3 in groups 1 and 2, and pnd 2–5 in
group 3.
ontogeny of motor activity was measured on pnd 13, 17, and 21 in groups
1 and 2, in 30-min sessions using photocell-based devices shaped like a
figure-8 (reiter et al., 1975). for group 1, testing took place before administering each day’s dose.
to evaluate the functional integrity of the dopaminergic system, adult rats
from the perinatal study were challenged with a series of d-amphetamine doses
(0, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg, ip) and tested during 1-h sessions in the figure-8
activity chambers. each rat received each dose in a semi-random order; testing
took place on tuesdays and fridays over 2 weeks.
chemicals. heptachlor (99% purity, radian corp., austin, tx) and dieldrin (98.5% purity, chem service, westchester, pa) were dissolved in corn oil
for animal dosing. for in vitro binding studies, heptachlor was dissolved in
95% ethanol and diluted in assay buffer. solutions were attempted with
heptachlor epoxide (99% purity, radian corp.) in either 95% ethanol or 100%
dmso, followed by buffer dilution; however, the epoxide was not sufficiently
soluble under these conditions.  xxxd2546xxx , butaclamol,  xxxd2746xxx ,  xxxd2419xxx , and d-amphetamine were obtained from sigma chemical (st. louis,
mo). [ 3h] xxxd2546xxx  (specific activity 21.0 ci/mmol), [ 3h]sch-23390 (75.5
ci/mmol), and [ 3h]spiperone (16.5 ci/mmol) were obtained from new england nuclear (boston, ma). all other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were of the highest available grade.
binding studies. to obtain tissues for binding studies, rats were euthanized as follows, on: (1) pnd 10, and pnd 22 in the perinatal and gestational
studies, (2) pnd 22, pnd 43, and pnd 128 in the first perinatal/adolescent
study, (3) pnd 130 in the second perinatal/adolescent study, and (4) pnd 43
in the dieldrin study. the brains were removed and striata were quickly
dissected and stored at – 80°c until use in binding assays. for all binding
assays, n ⫽ 4 –5/sex/dose, each representing a separate litter. male and female
tissues were assayed on separate days and therefore analyzed separately.

data analysis. dam and pup weight, proportion of pups righting within
5 s, and motor activity counts were analyzed by a general linear model (glm;
sas, 1990). for saturation and competition data, k d and b max values were
determined by nonlinear regression (graphpad prism 3.0, san diego, ca).
binding data were analyzed using unpaired 2-tailed t-tests or 1-way anovas
(with more than 2 treatment groups) followed by post hoc group comparisons
using dunnett’s t-test. in all cases, resulting probability values ⬍ 0.05 were
considered significant.

results

developmental and growth indices
heptachlor was maternally toxic in the perinatal and gestational studies, resulting in depression (6 –7%) of maternal
weight gain at the end of gestation (gd 18 –21; dose by
gestation day, p ⫽ 0.0001). maternal weight gain was decreased in the perinatal study by both doses (4.2 and 8.4
mg/kg/day), and only by the high dose in the gestational study.
in addition, the high dose of 8.4 mg/kg/day reduced pup
survival and caused some maternal convulsions. with continued dosing in the perinatal study, the health of the high-dose
dams was compromised and the rats were euthanized. in the
perinatal/adolescent studies, 3 mg/kg/day and lower had no
influence on maternal health. in all groups receiving 4.2 mg/
kg/day or less, litter size, survival, and pup growth parameters
throughout the study were not affected.

each test day.

behavioral tests
the proportion of rats reaching criteria (righting within 5 s)
was lowered across days in female pups dosed with 4.2 mg/
kg/day in the gestational but not the perinatal study (data not
shown). figure 1 shows that righting at 3 mg/kg/day was also
slowed in both sexes (dose p ⫽ 0.0026 and p ⫽ 0.0122 for
females and males, respectively) in the group-3 litters.
motor activity in control rats increased approximately 4-fold
from pnd 13 to 17, and remained nearly the same (within
10%) on pnd 21. there were no treatment-related differences
in the pattern (ontogeny) or levels of activity (data not shown).
adult rats showed an increase in activity (⬃20%) at 1 mg/kg
amphetamine, and the highest dose (3 mg/kg) decreased activity by 50%. again, there were no differences in the heptachlortreated rats on this dose response (data not shown).

the procedures for da-receptor binding using [ 3h]sch-23390 (d1 receptors) and [ 3h]spiperone (d2) followed previously published methods (madras
et al., 1988; xu et al., 1991). briefly, striata were homogenized in ice-cold
buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta, 150 mm nacl, and 5 mm mgcl 2, ph
7.4), centrifuged twice at 30,000 ⫻ g for 10 min, and resuspended in assay
buffer (50 mm tris-hcl buffer plus 40 nm  xxxd2419xxx  to block serotonergic
receptors). this homogenate was incubated with a saturating concentration of
either [ 3h]sch-23390 (4 nm), or [ 3h]spiperone (2 nm), ⫾ 10 ␮m butaclamol
(to define nonspecific binding).
the procedures for dat binding using [ 3h] xxxd2546xxx  followed the methods
of javitch et al. (1984). striata were homogenized and centrifuged as above in
ice-cold assay buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, 120 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, ph 7.4).
resuspended membrane homogenates were incubated with 30 nm [ 3h] xxxd2546xxx  ⫾ unlabeled  xxxd2546xxx  (10 ␮m). in this study, cold  xxxd2546xxx  (10 ␮m) was
used to determine nonspecific [ 3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding, as done in the studies on
which we based our procedures (e.g., javitch et al., 1984; moody et al., 1996;
shimizu and prasad, 1991). in other studies in this laboratory, however, the use
of another dat inhibitor ( xxxd2746xxx  10 ␮m) revealed the same level of
nonspecific binding compared to  xxxd2546xxx  (within 1%).
for competition binding assays, membrane homogenates were incubated
with 4 nm [ 3h] xxxd2546xxx  and unlabeled  xxxd2546xxx  (0.1 nm to 10 ␮m, 11
concentrations). in heptachlor binding assays, 30 nm [ 3h] xxxd2546xxx  was incubated with 0 –50 ␮m (6 concentrations) heptachlor ⫾ 10 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx .
unfortunately, heptachlor epoxide was not completely soluble when diluted in
the assay buffer, and thus the direct effects of heptachlor epoxide could not be
determined.
all binding assays were conducted in triplicate. tissues were incubated for
1 h at 0°c (dat binding) or 1 h at 37°c (da receptor binding). incubation was
terminated by the addition of ice-cold assay buffer and rapid filtration through
0.3% polyethylenimine pre-treated glass fiber filters in a cell harvester apparatus (brandel, u.s.). following 2 more rinses with ice-cold buffer, remaining
radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry at a counting
efficiency of 45%. protein was measured by the bicinchoninic acid (bca)
method (kit, sigma chemical, st. louis, mo).

significance (p ⫽ 0.08). in adult rats at pnd 128, there was a

both dose groups were significantly different from controls in
females, but in males, only the group dosed with 3.0 mg/kg/day
throughout the dosing period was significantly different from
controls.
the data for group 4 (exposed gd 10 through pnd 42)
males and females on pnd 130 are shown in figure 4. there
was an overall increase in dat binding (females p ⫽ 0.002;

in rats dosed with dieldrin during adolescence (3.0 mg/kg/

and declines sometime after pnd 145 (broaddus and bennett,

heptachlor doses of 3 mg/kg/day and less were neither
maternally nor developmentally toxic. however, 3 mg/kg/day
and higher produced a delay in the righting reflex ontogeny,
but only in perinatally dosed rats. this finding is consistent
with an earlier study (moser et al., 2001). the ontogeny of
motor activity was not altered. a slightly higher dose of 4.2
mg/kg/day decreased maternal weight gain in 1 (group 1) of 2
studies. the highest dose, 8.4 mg/kg/day, produced maternal
and developmental toxicity: data from those pups were only
included to show dose response.

heptachlor exposure alters dat binding

pression through its potent binding to the gaba a receptor.
heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide displace binding of 35stbps (t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate) to the gaba a receptor in rat brain, with ic 50s of 400 and 70 nm, respectively
(abalis et al., 1985). since gaba is a trophic factor for the
development of the monoaminergic system (lauder et al.,
1998), blockade of the gaba a receptor during development
could result in alterations in the dopaminergic system, including long-term increases in dat levels. arguing against that
hypothesis, however, is the finding that adolescent (pnd 21–
42) exposure also altered dat binding; at that age neuronal
proliferation is essentially complete. on the other hand, blockade of the gaba a receptor in the striatum has been shown to
increase da release in adult rats (gong et al., 1998), which
could lead to a compensatory increase in dat levels.
many toxic substances may be substrates for the dat
(miller et al., 1999a). 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) produces pd-like effects in human and nonhuman primates (burns et al., 1983). the active metabolite of
mptp, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp ⫹), is actively
transported into presynaptic nerve terminals through the dat,
and is cytotoxic to dopaminergic cells (javitch et al., 1985; pifl
et al., 1993; santiago et al., 1996). mptp is not neurotoxic in
mice lacking the dat (bezard et al., 1999; gainetdinov et al.,
1997), and overexpression of the dat in mice results in a 50%
greater loss of dopaminergic neurons following a course of
mptp (donovan et al., 1999). consequently, the dat may be
an important site by which some environmental neurotoxicants
enter and subsequently damage dopaminergic nerve terminals.
the present finding of increased dat binding concurs with,
and extends, similar results of heptachlor exposure in adult
mice (kirby et al., 2001; miller et al., 1999b). several doses of
heptachlor, 3 to 4 times higher than in these studies, were
shown to cause upregulation of dat in adult mice (measured
by immunoreactivity), and increased synaptic uptake of dopamine ex vivo, but not in vitro in cells expressing the dat. an
increased susceptibility to mptp neurotoxicity in heptachlortreated mice has also been reported (garcia et al., 2000).
therefore, by increasing dat levels, heptachlor and dieldrin
may increase the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to
pesticides and other neurotoxicants. these findings support the
idea that cyclodienes may be involved in a link between
pesticide exposure and parkinson’s disease (corrigan et al.,
2000; fleming et al., 1994).
in summary, gestational, perinatal, and adolescent exposure
to heptachlor and dieldrin increased dat levels, both during
and for months after exposure. this is the first evidence of such
prolonged neurochemical alteration of early heptachlor exposure at doses that produce no overt toxicity. in addition, a direct
effect of heptachlor on the dat was demonstrated in vitro,
albeit at a high concentration. such a persistent change may be
cause for concern. one hypothesis is that these heptachlorinduced alterations in the dopaminergic system during infancy
and childhood could increase the risk of developing parkin-

dat binding was increased by all heptachlor treatments,
including those that were ineffective on other endpoints. even
the lowest dose of 0.3 mg/kg/d significantly increased dat
binding, i.e., a no-effect level could not be determined. these
doses produced neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits in the
adult offspring as well as decreased gaba a receptor binding
immediately after dosing (moser et al., 2001). in addition, a
similar increase in dat binding was shown following adolescent exposure to another cyclodiene, dieldrin. there is evidence that some pesticides, e.g., triadimefon (walker and mailman, 1996) and rotenone (ferrante et al., 1997), affect the
dopaminergic system by binding to the dat. the present in
vitro results show that heptachlor may be added to this list.
cyclodienes affect gabaergic neurotransmission (abalis et
al., 1986; cole and casida, 1986; gant et al., 1987; lawrence
and casida, 1984), and are cytotoxic to primary cultures of
dopaminergic neurons (sanchez-ramos et al., 1998). in this
study, d1 and d2 da-receptor binding at pnd 10 and 21 was
unchanged in rats exposed perinatally to heptachlor (group 1).
da-receptor binding was also not altered (data not shown) in
1-year-old rats from a previous heptachlor study (moser et al.,
2001). da-receptor expression does not fully reflect potential
changes in dopaminergic function, and changes in receptor
levels may not necessarily be expected since dat expression
does not correspond to da levels in young rats (shimizu and
prasad, 1991). as further evidence of a lack of correlation
between dat and da-receptor binding, the behavioral response to d-amphetamine was not different in heptachlortreated rats compared to controls, indicating a normal response
of the dopaminergic system.
in the present study, striatal dat binding was increased in
both males and females, even in rats exposed only during
gestation (group 2) or only during adolescence (group 3).
thus, it appears that heptachlor exposure at any time during
neuronal development increases dat binding. in addition, this
increase persisted into adulthood, as long as 3 months after the
end of dosing. since there was no difference in the affinity (k d)
of  xxxd2546xxx  for the dat in heptachlor-exposed striata, these
changes in binding reflect increases in b max. it is possible that
these changes could persist into old age, and thus would
represent a long-term consequence of very early exposure.
one possible mechanism by which heptachlor affects dat
levels is by directly binding to the protein. developmental
exposure to dat inhibitors, such as cocaine, has been shown
to increase dat binding (e.g., fang and r␳nnekleiv, 1999),
but results of adult exposures have been less clear (letchworth
et al., 1999). however, it seems unlikely that the weak heptachlor effect to decrease dat binding could alone result in
robust increases in dat expression. this mechanism may also
lack physiological relevance since the predominant form of
heptachlor in tissues is heptachlor epoxide. unfortunately, in
the present study, the binding assays with the epoxide were
inconclusive.
alternatively, it is possible that heptachlor alters dat ex-

son’s disease later in life by increasing the vulnerability of
dopaminergic neurons to other neurotoxicants. further studies
in aged rats, which are exposed to cyclodienes early in life,
may help to address these questions.
