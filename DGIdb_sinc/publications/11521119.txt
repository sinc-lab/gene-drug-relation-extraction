preclinical profiles of progestins used in formulations of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy.  progestins used in oral contraceptive formulations available in the united states include  xxxd2753xxx ,  xxxd1849xxx ,  xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2751xxx  acetate, and levonorgestrel. progestins used in the united states in continuous and intermittent formulations of hormone replacement therapy are  xxxd2753xxx ,  xxxd2554xxx , and  xxxd2751xxx  acetate. the chemical structure of a progestin determines its relative binding affinity for the progesterone and androgen receptors, as well as the  xxxg2066xxx  in human serum, and determines its clinical profile. overall, the properties of levonorgestrel or  xxxd2751xxx  acetate in this regard differ from  xxxd2753xxx  and are more conducive to androgenic stimulation. estrogen replacement offers cardioprotective effects in postmenopausal women. progestins are added to hormone replacement therapy to counteract the well-known increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia associated with the use of unopposed estrogen. animal models show that for some parameters, including improvement of lipid profiles, progestins can diminish the cardioprotective effect of estrogen. initial animal studies of  xxxd2753xxx  combined with estrogen do not show an attenuation of estrogenic effects.
