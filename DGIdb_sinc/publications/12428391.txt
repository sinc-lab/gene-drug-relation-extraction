[beta 2-adrenoceptor polymorphism and effect of inhaled beta 2-stimulant ( xxxd3017xxx ) on airway resistance measured by body plethysmography in heal...  this study was designed to evaluate, in healthy volunteers, differences of bronchodilator responsiveness to a beta 2-agonist between those with the arg 16/gly 16 allele and those with the gly 16/gly 16 allele at codon 16 of beta 2 adrenoceptor polymorphism. peak flow and pulmonary functions were measured by body plethysmography after the inhalation of  xxxd3017xxx . in the arg 16/gly 16 group, the resulting acute increase of v 25 and acute decrease of airway resistance were greater, and the bronchodilator effect of a single inhaled beta 2-agonist was longer, than those observed in the gly 16/gly 16 group. the present study showed that a single inhalation of  xxxd3017xxx  has a varying bronchodilator effect on healthy adults, depending on the genotype of beta 2 adrenoceptor polymorphism at codon 16.
