1 dfu (5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-¯uorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl)phenyl-2(5h)-furanone) was identi®ed as
a novel orally active and highly selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) inhibitor.
2 in cho cells stably transfected with human cox isozymes, dfu inhibited the arachidonic aciddependent production of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) with at least a 1,000 fold selectivity for cox-2
(ic50=41+14 nm) over cox-1 (ic50450 mm). indomethacin was a potent inhibitor of both cox-1
(ic50=18+3 nm) and cox-2 (ic50=26+6 nm) under the same assay conditions. the large increase in
selectivity of dfu over indomethacin was also observed in cox-1 mediated production of thromboxane
b2 (txb2) by ca2+ ionophore-challenged human platelets (ic50450 mm and 4.1+1.7 nm, respectively).
3 dfu caused a time-dependent inhibition of puri®ed recombinant human cox-2 with a ki value of
140+68 mm for the initial reversible binding to enzyme and a k2 value of 0.11+0.06 s71 for the ®rst
order rate constant for formation of a tightly bound enzyme-inhibitor complex. comparable values of
62+26 mm and 0.06+0.01 s71, respectively, were obtained for indomethacin. the enzyme-inhibitor
complex was found to have a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and to dissociate only very slowly (t1/2=1 ± 3 h) with
recovery of intact inhibitor and active enzyme. the time-dependent inhibition by dfu was decreased by
co-incubation with  xxxd208xxx  under non-turnover conditions, consistent with reversible
competitive inhibition at the cox active site.
4 inhibition of puri®ed recombinant human cox-1 by dfu was very weak and observed only at low
concentrations of substrate (ic50=63+5 mm at 0.1 mm  xxxd208xxx ). in contrast to cox-2,
inhibition was time-independent and rapidly reversible. these data are consistent with a reversible
competitive inhibition of cox-1.
5 dfu inhibited lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced pge2 production (cox-2) in a human whole blood
assay with a potency (ic50=0.28+0.04 mm) similar to indomethacin (ic50=0.68+0.17 mm). in contrast,
dfu was at least 500 times less potent (ic50497 mm) than indomethacin at inhibiting coagulationinduced txb2 production (cox-1) (ic50=0.19+0.02 mm).
6 in a sensitive assay with u937 cell microsomes at a low  xxxd208xxx  concentration (0.1 mm),
dfu inhibited cox-1 with an ic50 value of 13+2 mm as compared to 20+1 nm for indomethacin.
cgp 28238,  xxxd2065xxx  and sc-58125 were about 10 times more potent inhibitors of cox-1 than dfu.
the order of potency of various inhibitors was diclofenac4indomethacin*naproxen4nimesulide*
 xxxd2561xxx *piroxicam4ns-398*sc-576664sc-581254cgp 28238*etodolac4l-745,3374dfu.
7 dfu inhibited dose-dependently both the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema (ed50 of
1.1 mg kg71 vs 2.0 mg kg71 for indomethacin) and hyperalgesia (ed50 of 0.95 mg kg71 vs 1.5 mg kg71
for indomethacin). the compound was also eective at reversing lps-induced pyrexia in rats
(ed50=0.76 mg kg71 vs 1.1 mg kg71 for indomethacin).
8 in a sensitive model in which 51cr faecal excretion was used to assess the integrity of the
gastrointestinal tract in rats, no signi®cant eect was detected after oral administration of dfu
(100 mg kg71, b.i.d.) for 5 days, whereas chromium leakage was observed with lower doses of diclofenac
(3 mg kg71),  xxxd2561xxx  (3 mg kg71) or  xxxd2065xxx  (10 ± 30 mg kg71). a 5 day administration of dfu in
squirrel monkeys (100 mg kg71) did not aect chromium leakage in contrast to diclofenac (1 mg kg71)
or naproxen (5 mg kg71).
9 the results indicate that cox-1 inhibitory eects can be detected for all selective cox-2 inhibitors
tested by use of a sensitive assay at low substrate concentration. the novel inhibitor dfu shows the
lowest inhibitory potency against cox-1, a consistent high selectivity of inhibition of cox-2 over cox1 (4300 fold) with enzyme, whole cell and whole blood assays, with no detectable loss of integrity of the
gastrointestinal tract at doses 4200 fold higher than ecacious doses in models of in¯ammation, pyresis
and hyperalgesia. these results provide further evidence that prostanoids derived from cox-1 activity
are not important in acute in¯ammatory responses and that a high therapeutic index of antiin¯ammatory eect to gastropathy can be achieved with a selective cox-2 inhibitor.

profile of a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor

introduction
prostaglandin synthase catalyses the conversion of arachidonic
acid to prostaglandin h2 (pgh2) which serves as the common
precursor for the synthesis of prostaglandins, prostacyclins
and thromboxanes. pgh2 synthesis by prostaglandin synthase
occurs as a two-step reaction, the conversion of arachidonic
acid to pgg2 (cyclo-oxygenase activity) followed by the reduction of the hydroperoxide moiety of pgg2 to yield pgh2
(peroxidase activity). the cyclo-oxygenase activity of the enzyme is the site of action of non-steroidal anti-in¯ammatory
drugs (nsaids), including aspirin, ibuprofen and indomethacin which are widely used as anti-in¯ammatory, analgesic and antipyretic agents (vane & botting, 1995;
herschman, 1996; griswold & adams, 1996). however, the
inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis has also been associated
with the side eects of nsaids such as irritation and ulcer
formation in the upper gastrointestinal tract (wallace, 1994)
and impairment of kidney function (murray & brater, 1993).
gastric and intestinal ulceration and haemorrhage are major
complications associated with the chronic use of nsaids and
can lead to life-threatening situations (allison et al., 1992).
it has been recognized recently that mammalian cells express two forms of cyclo-oxygenase (cox) activity. cox-1 is
expressed in many normal tissues and is the major form present in platelets, kidney and gastrointestinal tract (funk et al.,
1991; harris et al., 1994; kargman et al., 1996a). cox-2 is
induced in response to pro-in¯ammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide (lps) and growth factors and subjected to repression by glucocorticosteroids. this second form is generally not
detected in healthy tissues but is found in elevated levels in
in¯ammatory exudates (harada et al., 1996). these observations have led to the hypothesis that cox-1 is mainly associated with homeostasis and cox-2 with the oedematous,
nociceptive and pyretic eects of in¯ammation.
most classical nsaids, including indomethacin, ¯urbiprofen and ibuprofen, show little speci®city of inhibition towards cox isoforms (battistini et al., 1994). studies with
recently developed compounds, such as ns-398 (futaki et al.,
1993a,b; 1994), dup 697 (gans et al., 1990), l-745,337 (chan
et al., 1995), sc-58125 (seibert et al., 1994) and cgp 28238
(klein et al., 1994) have demonstrated that selective cox-2
inhibitors retain the anti-in¯ammatory eects characteristic of
nsaids with a marked increased gastrointestinal tolerability
as compared to less selective inhibitors. all these observations
suggest that cox-1 inhibition is a major contributing factor in
nsaid-related toxicity and has prompted the search for the
identi®cation of selective cox-2 inhibitors for clinical evaluation. we present here the detailed pro®le of dfu (figure
1), a highly selective and orally active inhibitor of cox-2 with
no sign of gastrointestinal ulceration at 4200 times the dose
for anti-in¯ammatory, analgesic and antipyretic eects.

methods
spectrophotometric assay of recombinant human cox-2
recombinant human cox-1 (cromlish and kennedy, unpublished observations) and cox-2 were expressed in sf-9
cells (cromlish et al., 1994) and puri®ed as previously described (percival et al., 1994). enzymatic activity was measured
by use of a chromogenic assay based on the oxidation of
n,n,n',n'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (tmpd) during
the reduction of pgg2 to pgh2 (copeland et al., 1994). the
assay mixture (180 ml) contains 100 mm sodium phosphate,
ph 6.5, 1 mm hematin, 1 mg ml71 gelatin, 80 ± 100 units of
puri®ed enzyme (one unit of enzyme is de®ned as the amount
of enzyme required to produce an o.d. change of 0.001 min71
at 610 nm) and 4 ml of the test compound in dimethylsulphoxide (dmso). the mixture was preincubated at room temperature (228c) for 15 min before initiation of the enzymatic
reaction by the addition of 20 ml of a solution of 1 mm ara-

chidonic acid and 1 mm tmpd in assay buer (without enzyme or hematin). the enzyme activity was measured by
estimation of the initial velocity of tmpd oxidation over the
®rst 36 s of the reaction. a non-speci®c rate of oxidation was
observed in the absence of enzyme (0.007 ± 0.01 o.d. min71)
and was subtracted before the calculation of the % inhibition.
ic50 values were derived from the 4-parameter least squares
non-linear regression analysis of the log-dose vs % inhibition
plot. for measurement of cox-2 peroxidase activity, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 ml of a solution of
4 mm  xxxd2298xxx  and 0.5 mm tmpd in assay buer.

oxygen consumption assay for cox-2 activity
cyclo-oxygenase activity was monitored continuously by
oxygen consumption by a clark-type polarographic oxygen
probe. the oxygen chamber was ®lled with 0.60 ml of reaction
buer (100 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 5 mm edta, 1 mm hematin, 1 mm phenol, 100 mm  xxxd208xxx , t=308 or 378c)
and the reaction was initiated by addition of puri®ed recombinant human cox-2. the enzyme activity was determined from the maximal (initial) velocity of oxygen
consumption.

determination of ki and k2 values for the time-dependent
inhibition of cox-2
puri®ed cox-2 (2.3 mg) was preincubated with inhibitor for
0 ± 15 min in 180 ml of the reaction buer described above,
before the initiation of the reaction with a mixture of  xxxd208xxx  and tmpd. the cyclo-oxygenase activity was determined by the spectrophotometric method as described
above. for experiments performed without preincubation of
the inhibitor, the reaction was initiated by addition of the assay
mixture containing the enzyme to the inhibitor and  xxxd208xxx /tmpd ethanolic solution. the rate constants (kobs)
for the time-dependent loss of activity at each inhibitor concentration were calculated by ®tting of the data to a ®rst order
equation of the form y=a+b.exp(7kobst) by use of sigmaplot
software. data were analysed in terms of the model developed
by rome and lands (1975) for the time-dependent inhibition
of ovine cox-1. in this model (scheme 1), an initial reversible
binding of enzyme and inhibitor (characterized by the dissociation constant ki) is followed by a ®rst order inactivation
process (characterized by a ®rst order rate constant k2). the
rate of reversal of this process (k72) is considered to be negligible.

this model predicts that the observed rate constant (kobs) for
the exponential loss of cyclo-oxygenase activity during the

determination of the stoichiometry of inhibitor binding
aliquots of puri®ed cox-2 (0.25 mg ml71, concentration of
subunit of 3.4 mm) were incubated in buer (100 mm tris-hcl,
ph 8.0, 5 mm edta, 1 mm phenol) in the presence of varying
concentrations of inhibitors (0 ± 8 mm) for 15 or 30 min. an
aliquot (20 ml) was then removed for determination of the remaining cyclo-oxygenase activity by oxygen uptake as described above. enzyme concentration was determined by
amino acid concentration following acid hydrolysis (percival et
al., 1994).

recovery of inhibitor from the cox-2-inhibitor complex
puri®ed cox-2 (0.79 nmol) was treated with 1.0 mol equivalent of inhibitor and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at
room temperature. the remaining activity at this time was 4%
that of a vehicle-treated control. the sample was then divided
in two and the protein denatured by treatment with four volumes of ethyl acetate/methanol/1 m  xxxd1710xxx  (30 : 4 : 1). after
extraction and centrifugation (10,000  xxxg65xxx  min), the organic
layer was removed and the extraction repeated. the two organic layers were combined and dried under n2. the extract
was dissolved in 100 ml of the high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) solvent mixture consisting of water/
acetonitrile/acetic acid (50 : 41 : 0.1) and 50 ml were injected
onto a novapak c-18 column (3.9 mm6150 mm) and developed at 1 ml min71. the inhibitor was detected by absorption
at 260 nm and eluted with a retention time of 6.6 min in this
system. control experiments for inhibitor recovery were performed with incubation of the inhibitor in the absence of enzyme and processing of the samples in an identical fashion
before quantitation by h.p.l.c.

determination of the dissociation rate constant of the
enzyme-inhibitor complex
(i) puri®ed cox-2 (2.0 nmol, 2.0 ml) in 20 mm tris-hcl,
ph 8.0, 0.1 mm edta, 2 mm hematin, 0.1% b-octylglucoside
was treated with 2.0 nmol [14c]-dfu (18 ci mol71) and incubated at 208c for 3 h. a control (0.7 ml) was removed and
13 nmol unlabelled dfu was added to the remaining 1.3 ml of
the mixture containing cox-2 and [14c]-dfu. at timed intervals, 0.1 ml (in duplicate) was transferred to a microcon-30
micro concentration device (amicon) and the free inhibitor
separated from enzyme-bound inhibitor by centrifugation at
14,0006g for 6 min at 48c. buer (0.1 ml) was added to the
retentate and the centrifugation repeated. the ®ltrate and retentate were then removed and mixed with 10 ml scintillation
¯uid and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. all of the
added radioactivity (99%) was recovered in the sum of the
retentate and ®ltrate solutions. (ii) an aliquot of puri®ed
cox-2 (1.0 nmol) was treated with 1.25 mol equivalents of
inhibitor or with dmso vehicle control and incubated at 208c
for 1 h. the enzyme-inhibitor mixture was then transferred to
a pierce microdialyzer 100 apparatus and dialysed continuously against 2 l of buer (20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8, 0.1 mm
edta, 0.1 mm phenol, 0.1% octylglucoside) for 5 h at 228c
during which aliquots were removed and frozen at 7708c
until assayed for cyclo-oxygenase activity by oxygen uptake at
378c as described above.

competition of time-dependent inhibition of cox-2 by
 xxxd208xxx 
puri®ed cox-2 (3.6 mg) was diluted into preincubation buer
(0.03 ml, 100 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 5 mm edta, 2 mm
phenol) containing 60 mm  xxxd1917xxx  to pre-

profile of a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor

vent substrate oxygenation (lands et al., 1974) and either
10 mm inhibitor, or 10 mm inhibitor plus 5 mm arachidonic
acid, or 10 mm inhibitor plus 30 mm  xxxd208xxx . after a
preincubation period of 0 ± 4 min, the total enzyme was assayed for enzymatic activity by oxygen consumption at 308c as
described above.

h.p.l.c. assay for oxygenation of radiolabelled
 xxxd208xxx  by cox-1
puri®ed recombinant human cox-1 (50 ml of 1 mg ml71 in
100 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 5 mm edta, 1 mm phenol, 1 mm
hematin) was preincubated with 2 ml of the inhibitor solution
(50 fold concentrated stock in dmso, 0 ± 2.5 mm) for 15 min.
the reaction was then initiated by the addition of 5 ml of 1 mm
[14c]- xxxd208xxx  (0.005 mci, nen-dupont) to obtain a
®nal concentration of 0.1 mm. after a 7 min incubation at
room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of
5 ml 1 m hcl and 50 ml acetonitrile. aliquots of 50 ml of each
reaction mixture were analysed for substrate conversion by
reverse phase h.p.l.c. onto a c-18 nova-pak column
(3.96150 mm) which was developed with acetonitrile/water/
acetic acid (85 : 15 : 0.1) at 2 ml min71.  xxxd208xxx  metabolites and  xxxd208xxx  eluted at 0.6 ± 1 min and 2.2 ±
2.5 min, respectively, and were quantitated by a packard floone radiochromatography detector. percentages of inhibition
were calculated from the dierence in conversion of  xxxd208xxx  to prostaglandin metabolites between inhibitortreated samples and controls exposed to the dmso vehicle.

reversibility of inhibition of cox-1
puri®ed cox-1 (25 ml of 30 mg ml71 in 100 mm tris-hcl,
ph 8.0, 5 mm edta, 1 mm phenol, 1 mm hematin) was incubated with either 1 ml of a solution of 2.5 mm inhibitor in
dmso or with vehicle control. after preincubation periods of
1 to 60 min at room temperature, 1.7 ml of the mixture was
diluted into 50 ml of 100 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 5 mm edta,
1 mm phenol, 1 mm hematin containing 0.1 mm [14c]- xxxd208xxx  (0.005 mci). the reaction was stopped after 7 min
and 80 ml was analysed by h.p.l.c. for the conversion of [14c] xxxd208xxx  as described above.

intact cell assays with transfected cho cells expressing
cox-1 and cox-2
stably transfected chinese hamster ovarian (cho) cells expressing human cox-1 and cox-2 were cultured and assayed
for the production of pge2 following stimulation by  xxxd208xxx  as previously described (kargman et al., 1996b).
cells (0.36106 cells in 200 ml) were preincubated in hank's
balanced salts solution (hbss) containing 15 mm hepes,
ph 7.4, with 3 ml of the test drug or dmso vehicle for 15 min
at 378c before challenge with  xxxd208xxx . cells were
challenged for 15 min with an  xxxd208xxx  solution (10%
ethanol in hbss) to yield ®nal concentrations of 10 mm  xxxd208xxx  in the cho[cox-2] assay and of 0.5 mm  xxxd208xxx  in the cho[cox-1] assay. in the absence of
exogenous  xxxd208xxx , levels of pge2 in samples from
cho[cox-1] and cho[cox-2] cells were 580 pg pge2 per
106 cells. in the presence of 0.5 mm exogenous arachidonic
acid, levels of pge2 in samples from cho[cox-1] cells increased to 300 ± 2300 pg pge2 per 106 cells, whereas in the
presence of 10 mm exogenous  xxxd208xxx , levels of pge2
in samples from cho[cox-2] cells increased to 500 ± 1400 pg
pge2 per 106 cells. cyclo-oxygenase activity in the absence of
test compounds is determined as the dierence in pge2 levels
of cells challenged with  xxxd208xxx  versus the pge2 levels
in cells mock-challenged with ethanol vehicle. each experiment
included a set of 8 positive and negative control samples
(+ xxxd208xxx  challenge) for cells preincubated in the
absence of inhibitor. compounds were typically tested at 8
concentrations in duplicate with 3 fold serial dilutions in

108

d. riendeau et al

dmso. inhibition of pge2 synthesis by test compounds is
calculated as a percentage of the activity in the presence of
drug versus the activity in the positive control samples.

reversibility of inhibition of pge2 production by
cho[cox-2] cells
cho cells transfected with cox-2 were grown to con¯uency,
harvested following incubation with 0.25% trypsin/0.1%
edta (jrh biosciences) and washed with hanks balanced
salt solution buered with 15 mm hepes (ph 6.9) and containing 50 mm cycloheximide. the cells (1.56106 cells ml71,
total volume of 8 ml) were preincubated with 0.15 mm dfu
(from a 1,000 fold concentrated solution in dmso) or vehicle
control for 15 min. three 0.5 ml aliquots were removed from
each incubation mixture and assayed for arachidonic aciddependent production of pge2. the remaining aliquots of
6.5 ml cells were spun at 3006g for 8 min at 198c. the supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was then resuspended in 25 ml hhbss containing cycloheximide, washed
twice, and resuspended in 6.5 ml of the buer. the cell suspension was divided into 0.5 ml aliquots and incubated at 378c
until assayed for the recovery of cellular cox-2 activity as
described above.

txb2 production by calcium ionophore-activated human
platelets
washed human platelets in hbss buered with 15 mm
hepes, ph 7.4, were preincubated at a ®nal concentration of
46107 cells ml71 (0.2 ± 0.25 ml) in the absence or presence of
the inhibitor (from a 125 fold concentrated solution in dmso)
for 15 min before stimulation with 2 mm calcium ionophore
a23187. after a further 10 min incubation at 378c, cold methanol (50% by volume) was added to stop the reaction and
txb2 levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay (assay
designs, inc.). inhibitors were tested at 8 concentrations using
3 fold serial dilutions of the highest drug concentration. human platelets released 13 ± 20 ng of txb2 per 107 cells following challenge with the calcium ionophore (a23187) and 4 ±
10 ng txb2 per 107 cells when stimulated with 1 mm  xxxd208xxx . less than 5% of the production of txb2 was observed in the absence of ionophore challenge.

inhibition of cox-1 from u937 cells microsomes
u937 cells were resuspended in 0.1 m tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 10 mm
edta, 2 mg ml71 leupeptin, 2 mg ml71 soybean  xxxd207xxx , 2 mg ml71 aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl
¯uoride. the cell suspension was sonicated 4 times for 10 s
(cole parmer ultrasonic homogenizer 4710, output control:
3.8; 70% duty cycle) and then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,0006g for
10 min at 48c. the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,0006g
for 1 h at 48c. the remaining pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m
tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 10 mm edta and protein concentration
determined by use of the bio-rad coomassie protein stain.
aliquots of microsomal preparations (7 ± 20 mg of protein ml71) were stored at 7808c. immediately before use,
microsomal preparations were thawed, subjected to a brief
sonication, and then diluted to a protein concentration of
125 mg ml71 in 0.1 m tris-hcl, 10 mm edta, ph 7.4 containing 0.5 mm phenol, 1 mm  xxxd2213xxx , and 1 mm
hematin. compounds were tested at 8 concentrations in duplicate with 3 fold serial dilutions in dmso of the highest drug
concentration. a 5 ml sample of test compound or dmso vehicle was added to 20 ml of 0.1 m tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 10 mm
edta in a 96-well polypropylene minitube place (beckman)
and mixed with 200 ml of the microsomal suspension. after an
incubation for 15 min at room temperature, 25 ml of a solution
of 1 mm  xxxd208xxx  (peroxide-free, cayman chemical
co.) in 0.1 m tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 10 mm edta was then added
to give a ®nal concentration of  xxxd208xxx  of 0.1 mm. the
samples were mixed and incubated at room temperature for

profile of a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor

40 min. control samples contained ethanol vehicle instead of
 xxxd208xxx . following the incubation period, the reaction
was terminated by the addition of 25 ml of 1 n hcl. samples
were neutralized by the addition of 25 ml of 1 n naoh before
analysis for pge2 levels by radioimmunoassay (nen-dupont
or amersham). cyclo-oxygenase activity in the absence of test
compounds is de®ned as the dierence between pge2 levels in
samples incubated in the presence of  xxxd208xxx  versus
ethanol vehicle.

cox-2 human whole blood assay (lps-induced pge2
production)
the human cox-2 and cox-1 whole blood assays were
performed with essentially the same procedures as described
previously (brideau et al., 1996), the subjects used had no
apparent in¯ammatory conditions and had not taken any
nsaids for at least 7 days before the blood collection. aliquots of 500 ml of blood were incubated with either 2 ml vehicle
(dmso) or 2 ml of a test compound at ®nal concentrations
ranging from 40 nm to 30 mm for 15 min before the addition of
10 ml lps in pbs (100 mg ml71 ®nal concentration) for 24 h at
378c for induction of cox-2. at the end of the incubation, the
blood was centrifuged at 12,0006g for 5 min to obtain plasma. following protein precipitation with absolute methanol
(1 : 4), the supernatant was obtained and was assayed for pge2
by radioimmunoassay (amersham).

cox-1 human whole blood assay (coagulation-induced
txb2 production)
fresh blood was collected into vacutainers containing no
anticoagulants. aliquots of 500 ml were immediately transferred to siliconized microcentrifuge tubes preloaded with
2 ml of either dmso or a test compound at ®nal concentrations ranging from 1 to 97 mm. the tubes were vortexed and incubated at 378c for 1 h to allow the blood to
clot. at the end of the incubation, the serum was obtained by
centrifugation (12,0006g for 5 min), proteins were precipitated with absolute methanol (1 : 4), and the supernatant
was assayed for txb2 by use of an enzyme immunoassay kit
(cayman chemical).

in vivo experiments
all in vivo experimental procedures were approved by the
animal care committee at the merck frosst centre for
therapeutic research (canada) and at the merck, sharp and
dohme neuroscience centre (uk) according to guidelines
established by the canadian council on animal care and the
british home oce, respectively. these procedures were essentially the same as those described previously (chan et al.,
1995). they are brie¯y described below. in all cases, the test
compound was administered orally in 1% methocellulose
suspension.
carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema male sprague-dawley
rats (150 ± 200 g) were fasted for 16 ± 18 h before the oral administration of either the vehicle (1% methocel) or a test
compound. one hour later, the paw volume was measured by a
water displacement plethysmometer (ugo-basile, italy). the
animals were then injected intraplantarly with 50 ml of a 1%
carrageenan solution in saline (i.e. 500 mg carrageenan per
paw). three hours later, the paw volume was measured again
and the increases in paw volume from time zero were calculated. paw oedema was compared with the vehicle-control
group and the % inhibition calculated taking the values in the
control group as 0%. a dose that gave 50% inhibition (id50)
was calculated. all treatment groups were coded to eliminate
bias from the observer.
carrageenan-induced rat paw hyperalgesia hyperalgesia to
mechanical compression of the hind paw of male sprague-

dawley rats (90 ± 110 g) was induced by intraplantar injection
of carrageenan (4.5 mg per paw) 3 h previously. a test compound was given orally 2 h after carrageenan. the vocalization
response to compression of the carrageenan-injected paw was
measured 1 h later by an algesiometer (ugo-basile, italy).
endotoxin-induced pyretic responses in rats male spraguedawley rats (150 ± 200 g) were deprived of food for 16 ± 18 h
before use. at approximately 9 h 30 min, the animals were
placed temporarily in plexiglass restrainers and their baseline
rectal temperatures were recorded with a ¯exible temperature
probe (ysi series 400) connected to a digital thermometer
(model 08502, cole parmer). at time zero, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with either saline or lps
(360 mg kg71) and the rectal temperatures were measured
again at 5, 6 and 7 h following lps injection. a test compound
was administered orally 5 h after lps injection (when the
rectal temperature increased by approximately 28c) to determine whether the compound could reverse the pyretic responses. % reversal of the pyrexia was calculated by use of the
rectal temperature obtained  xxxd2274xxx  h in the control group as the
reference (zero reversal) point. complete reversal of pyrexia to
the pre-lps baseline value is taken as 100%.
51
cr faecal excretion in rats male sprague-dawley rats (150 ±
200 g) were dosed orally with a test compound either once
(acute dosing) or twice daily for 5 days (chronic dosing). a
plasma sample was obtained 1 h after the morning dose on day
4 for measurement of drug concentration. immediately after
the administration of the last dose on day 5, the rats were
injected via a tail vein with 0.5 ml of 51cr-labelled red blood
cells from a donor rat after incubation with sodium 51chromate. the rats were placed individually in metabolism cages
with food and water ad libitum. faeces were collected for a
48 h period and 51cr faecal excretion was calculated as a % of
total injected dose (20 mci per animal).
51

cr faecal excretion in squirrel monkeys squirrel monkeys
(saimiri sciureus; 0.8 ± 1.4 kg) were dosed orally with a test
compound twice daily for 1 ± 5 days. one hour after administration of the last dose, 51crcl3 in sterile saline (1 ml kg71, 4 ±
5 mci per animal) was injected via a saphenous vein and plasma
samples were obtained for measurement of drug concentration.
the monkeys were then housed individually in metabolism
cages. faeces were collected for a 24 h period and 51cr faecal
excretion was calculated as a % of total injected dose.

selective inhibition of cox-2 by dfu in intact cell
assays
the potency of dfu as an inhibitor of cellular cyclo-oxygenase activity was evaluated with  xxxd208xxx -stimulated
production of pge2 by cho cells expressing human cox-1
and cox-2. figure 2 shows a comparison of the dose-dependent inhibition of pge2 production by cells that were
pretreated with various amounts of dfu, indomethacin,
dup 697 and  xxxd2969xxx . dfu was a potent inhibitor of pge2
production by cho[cox-2] cells with an ic50 value
(41+14 nm) similar to that of indomethacin (26+6 nm) and
 xxxd2969xxx  (35+7 nm). when tested for the inhibition of pge2
production by cho[cox-1] cells, indomethacin was found to
be non-selective (ic50=18+3 nm) whereas  xxxd2969xxx  was
about a 100 fold less potent at inhibiting cox-1
(ic50=3.5+1.0 mm). dup 697 was a more potent inhibitor of
cox-2 (ic50=2.1+0.9 nm) and exhibited only a 30 fold sea

mechanism of inhibition of puri®ed recombinant human
cox-2 by dfu
the kinetic mechanism of the inhibition of cox-2 by dfu
was investigated with puri®ed recombinant human enzyme.
preincubation of the enzyme with various concentrations of
dfu for 15 min before  xxxd208xxx  addition resulted in a
dose-dependent inhibition of activity with an ic50 value similar
to that of indomethacin (ic50 values of 0.31 and 0.92 mm, respectively). the level of inhibition of cox-2 by dfu was
dependent upon the length of preincubation of enzyme and
inhibitor before the addition of substrate (figure 3). in the
absence of a preincubation, no inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase reaction rate was observed at the concentrations of dfu
up to 100 mm. when cox-2 was preincubated with dfu the
level of activity was reduced in a time-dependent manner, a
higher inhibitor concentration resulting in a faster loss of activity as illustrated in figure 3a for the curves obtained at 12
and 100 mm dfu. the inhibition of pge2 production by dfu
in cho[cox-2] cells was also time-dependent with ic50 values
of 410 mm, 0.56 mm, 0.23 mm and 0.05 mm obtained with

profile of a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor

preincubation periods of 0, 1, 3 and 15 min, respectively (data
not shown). the decrease in activity follows ®rst order kinetics
and was analysed according to a model (scheme 1) where inhibition results from reversible binding of enzyme and inhibitor (characterized by ki) followed by a ®rst order
inactivation process (characterized by k2). the rate of reversal
of this process (k72) is considered to be negligible on the
timescale of the experiment. average values of ki and k2 of
140+68 mm and 0.11+0.06 s71 (n=6) were obtained by
nonlinear regression analysis of the data (figure 3b). as a
comparison, the values for indomethacin were 62+26 mm and
0.06+0.01 s71 (n=2). the inhibition by dfu is speci®c for
the cyclo-oxygenase activity of cox-2 as no inhibition of
h2o2-dependent peroxidase activity was observed at the
highest concentration tested (100 mm).
the stoichiometry of the tightly bound enzyme-inhibitor
complex (ei*, scheme 1) was determined by a titration in
which aliquots of puri®ed cox-2 (3.4 mm) were treated with
0 ± 8 mm dfu and the remaining cyclo-oxygenase activity
measured after a 15 or 30 min preincubation period. a linear
decrease in enzyme activity with increasing inhibitor concentration was obtained with the break point in the titration
occurring at a concentration of 4.3 mm dfu (figure 4). no
increase in inhibition was evident at the longer preincubation
time. this result is therefore consistent with the formation of
an ei* complex having 1 : 1 stoichiometry. the results also
show that for the ei* complex a residual activity of approximately 9% of the uninhibited enzyme was retained in the
presence of an excess of dfu.
in order to determine if any inhibitor degradation or
covalent modi®cation of cox-2 occurs during the time-dependent inhibition by dfu, a study was performed to determine whether intact dfu could be recovered from the
enzyme-inhibitor complex. puri®ed cox-2 was treated with
one equivalent of dfu and incubated for 60 min. at this time
the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase activity was approximately 4% of
a vehicle-treated control. the enzyme-inhibitor complex was
then denatured by treatment with acidi®ed ethyl acetate/methanol and any released drug extracted from the protein.
h.p.l.c. of the extract showed a single peak with the same
retention time and u.v. spectrum as authentic dfu (data not
shown). comparison with an identically treated sample of
dfu in the absence of enzyme indicated that the recovery of
dfu was quantitative. these results are therefore consistent
with the non-covalent nature of the enzyme-inhibitor complex.
the inhibition of cox-2 by a structurally related compound, dup 697, was considered to be irreversible as no enzyme activity was recovered after a 5 h dialysis of the enzymeinhibitor complex (copeland et al., 1994). the reversibility of
the complex between dfu and cox-2 was determined in two

separate experiments. puri®ed cox-2 was treated with 1
equivalent of 14c-labelled dfu and after an extended preincubation, 10 equivalents of unlabelled dfu or vehicle was
added. aliquots were removed with time and any released
[14c]-dfu separated from enzyme-bound inhibitor by a micro
concentrator device. radioactivity measurements showed that
85% of the labelled inhibitor was initially bound to the enzyme
and that the label was released in a ®rst order fashion
(t1/2=1.2+0.1 h) following the addition of the 10 fold excess
of unlabelled dfu (data not shown). extrapolation of the
data to t=? shows that 85+1% of the label was displaced,
which is in fair agreement with the expected value of 91%. the
second experiment to demonstrate inhibitor reversibility involved the extended dialysis of a 1 : 1 cox-2-dfu complex
against a large excess of buer. the time course for the recovery of activity followed a ®rst order process with a t1/2 of
3.1+0.3 h. the slow reversal of inhibition of puri®ed cox-2
by dfu was also observed with cho[cox-2] cells treated
with 150 nm dfu in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent
further cox-2 expression. after treatment with the inhibitor,
the production of pge2 by cho[cox-2] cells was inhibited
495% compared to vehicle-treated control. however, fol-

111

lowing resuspension in fresh buer, the cellular cox activity
of dfu-treated cho cells recovered slowly. cox-2 activity
had recovered to 40% that of vehicle-treated controls at 5.5 h.
the results indicate that the dfu-cox-2 inhibitor complex
can dissociate slowly with a half-time of one to a few hours.
the eect of substrate  xxxd208xxx  on the timedependent inhibition of cox-2 by dfu was investigated. in
the presence of 10 mm dfu, cox-2 was inhibited in a timedependent manner with a t1/2 of 1.0 min. the inclusion of
 xxxd208xxx  (5 and 30 mm) in the preincubation mixture
reduced the rate of the onset of inhibition in a concentrationdependent manner (figure 5), such that no inhibition was
observed after 4 min in the presence of 30 mm arachidonic
acid. the results are consistent with dfu binding cox-2
competitively with  xxxd208xxx .
the overall dissociation constant (k1*) for the puri®ed
cox-2-dfu complex (ei*, scheme 1) can be calculated from
the kinetic constants determined above for the equilibrium
de®ned in scheme 1.

hence

substituting in the values obtained (with the value of
k2=0.0099+0.0004 min71 for the dissociation of [14c]-dfu)
gives an estimate of ki* of 0.21+0.13 mm.

inhibition of puri®ed human cox-1 by dfu is very weak. no
inhibition of cox-1 could be detected at 100 mm dfu under
the conditions of the tmpd assay in which the arachidonic
acid concentration is 100 mm. however, an ic50 value of
63+5 mm was obtained with the [14c]- xxxd208xxx  h.p.l.c.
assay at a lower substrate concentration (0.1 mm). in contrast
to cox-2, the inhibition of puri®ed cox-1 by dfu was not
dependent on the time of preincubation between inhibitor and
enzyme. the same degree of inhibition by 100 mm dfu
(52+14%) was observed with either the simultaneous addition
of inhibitor and  xxxd208xxx  (0.1 mm), or preincubation of
the inhibitor with the enzyme for periods of up to 60 min
before the addition of substrate. the increase in inhibition of

dependent inhibition are consistent with reversible competitive
behaviour by dfu.
experiments were conducted to evaluate the reversibility of
inhibition of cox-1 by dfu. puri®ed cox-1 was treated
with a concentration of dfu (100 mm) that is approximately
1 ± 2 times the ic50 value, before assaying for activity by dilution 30 fold into assay mixture containing substrate. the
activities of the inhibitor-treated enzyme samples were the
same as vehicle-treated controls. the lack of any inhibition
after dilution of the inhibitor therefore demonstrates the rapidly reversible nature of the inhibition of cox-1 by dfu.

evaluation of inhibitor selectivity with cho transfected
cells
the selectivity of dfu as a cox-2 inhibitor was compared to
that of conventional nsaids and recently developed selective
cox-2 inhibitors in cho cells transfected with each human
cox isozyme. ic50 values were determined in assays performed with a 15 min preincubation of the cells with inhibitors
in serum-free medium.  xxxd208xxx  was used at a lower
concentration (0.5 mm) in the cho[cox-1] cells than in cho[cox-2] cells (10 mm) to increase the sensitivity of the cox-1
assay for competitive inhibitors. data are summarized in table
1. the potency of dfu as an inhibitor of cellular cox-2
activity was similar to that of naproxen,  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd2065xxx  (ic50=25 ± 40 nm), but lower than that of the less selective inhibitors diclofenac, ¯urbiprofen or  xxxd3259xxx  sulphide
(ic50=1 ± 4 nm). ibuprofen and 6-mna, the active metabolite
of  xxxd2688xxx  (clarke et al., 1994), showed no selectivity of
inhibition under the conditions used. ns-398,  xxxd2727xxx ,
 xxxd2561xxx  and cgp 28238 (¯osulide) were all potent
(ic50=6 ± 13 nm) and selective (90 to 1000 fold) inhibitors of
cellular cox-2 activity, but were at least 6 to 60 times more
potent inhibitors in the cho[cox-1] assay than dfu. a 1000
fold or more selectivity was achieved with sc-57666, sc58125,  xxxd2065xxx , l-745,337 and dfu, for which more sensitive
assays are required to discriminate their relative eects on
cox-1.

inhibition of txb2 synthesis by human platelets
the production of txb2 by ca2+ ionophore-stimulated human platelets was used to evaluate further the potency of
inhibitors at blocking cox-1 mediated prostanoid production. in this assay, indomethacin and diclofenac were potent
inhibitors (ic50=2 ± 4 nm) and ns-398,  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  were about 3 to 4 fold more potent inhibitors of
txb2 production (ic50=500 ± 800 nm) than of pge2 production in cho[cox-1] cells. a higher sensitivity to inhibition of txb2 production was also observed for  xxxd2065xxx ,

0.4+0.1 mm, 2.1+0.2 mm, 4.8+1.4 mm and 6.0+1.7 mm, respectively. in contrast, preincubation of the platelets for
15 min with dfu caused less than 50% inhibition of txb2
release over the range of 0.05 ± 100 mm (33+6% inhibition,
n=8, at the highest dose of 100 mm). the eect of dfu was
also investigated with a more sensitive assay in which platelets were stimulated by a sub-optimal concentration of  xxxd208xxx  (1 mm) instead of 2 mm calcium ionophore.
under these conditions, inhibition of the arachidonic acidstimulated production of txb2 by dfu was detected with an
ic50 value of 12+5 mm (n=3).

inhibition of microsomal cox-1 from u937 cells at low
 xxxd208xxx  concentration
in order to characterize further the eects of inhibitors on
cox-1, a sensitive assay was developed based on the production of pge2 by u937 cell microsomes following incubation with a low, sub-saturating concentration of arachidonic
acid (0.1 mm). potent non-selective inhibitors such as diclofenac, indomethacin and naproxen showed ic50 values in the low
nm range in this assay (table 2).  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx  and
 xxxd2969xxx  inhibited with ic50 values ranging from 100 ±
200 nm. among the compounds that showed the highest selectivity in the cell-based assays, dfu (ic50=13+2 mm) was
about 10 to 40 fold less potent at inhibiting cox-1 than ns398, sc-58125, sc-57666, cgp28238 or  xxxd2065xxx  and 5 fold
less potent that l-745,337 (table 2).

cox-2 human whole blood assay (lps-induced pge2
production)
the production of pge2 by lps-challenged whole blood has
been used to evaluate the ecacy of cox-2 inhibitors in vitro
(brideau et al., 1996). the control, unstimulated human blood
at time zero, contained only small amounts of pge2
(0.28+0.04 ng ml71, n=12). in contrast, a substantial increase
in pge2 was observed following incubation with lps for 24 h,
resulting in a net increase of 35.8+5.5 ng ml71 (n=12). the
lps-induced production of pge2 was inhibited by dfu or
indomethacin in a concentration-dependent manner with
100% inhibition observed with both compounds (figure 6a).
the potency of dfu was similar to that of indomethacin with
ic50 values of 0.28+0.04 mm (n=12) and 0.68+0.17 mm
(n=14), respectively.

cox-1 human whole blood assay (coagulation-induced
txb2 production)
spontaneous clotting of human blood resulted in the generation of large amounts of txb2 in the serum
(72.9+8.9 ng ml71). indomethacin inhibited the production of
txb2 in a concentration-dependent manner, with an ic50
value of 0.19+0.02 mm (n=38) (figure 6b). in contrast, dfu
inhibited the production of txb2 by only 38% even at the
maximal concentration tested (97 mm). thus, indomethacin is
approximately equipotent at inhibiting both cox-1 and cox2 whereas dfu is greater than 300 fold more selective for
cox-2.

carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema
in the control group, the paw volume increased by
1.04+0.01 ml (n=10) 3 h after injection of carrageenan. dfu
(1 h pretreatment) inhibited the carrageenan-induced oedema
response dose-dependently (ed50=1.1 mg kg71, figure 7a).
dfu was slightly more potent than indomethacin
(id50=2.0 mg kg71) in this assay.

faecal 51cr excretion. in chronic dosing studies with indomethacin at 3 mg kg71, one of ®ve animals died of gastrointestinal side eects after 4 days of dosing. the remaining 4
animals showed overt clinical symptoms (loss of appetite, loss
of body weight, constipation, jaundice) and 51cr excretion
experiments could not be performed. in contrast, dfu at
100 mg kg71, b.i.d., for 5 days had no eect on faecal 51cr
excretion in either male or female rats. the plasma levels of
dfu were 5.8 mm and 6.7 mm, respectively, in male and female
rats 1 h after the morning dose at day 4.

administration of dfu 1 h before the hyperalgesia measurement dose-dependently reversed carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia with an ed50 of 0.95 mg kg71, dfu being slightly
more potent than indomethacin (ed50=1.5 mg kg71, figure

by dfu  xxxd1891xxx  mg kg71.

endotoxin-induced pyretic response in rats
in the saline-injected rats, the rectal temperature was maintained at a steady level throughout the course of the experiment, being at 36.32+0.08, 36.46+0.11, 36.38+0.06 and
36.36+0.078c (n=10) at 0, 5, 6 and 7 h, respectively. in

group
were
36.50+0.15,
38.80+0.08,
38.92+0.07 and 38.96+0.088c, respectively. this represented
a net increase of 2.58+0.078c in the lps-treated vehicle
control group 7 h after lps injection compared to the salineinjected group. oral administration of dfu at the plateau of
temperature elevation (5 h) reversed the lps-induction pyrexia in a dose-dependent manner (ed50 of 0.76 mg kg71,
figure 7b). the potency of dfu was comparable to that of
indomethacin (ed50=1.07 mg kg71).

cr faecal excretion in rats

acute dosing of indomethacin (10 mg kg71),  xxxd2561xxx 
(3 mg kg71) and  xxxd2065xxx  (10 ± 30 mg kg71), caused a signi®cant increase in faecal 51cr excretion in a 48 h period following injection of 51cr-labelled red blood cells (figure 8). in
chronic dosing studies, administration of diclofenac at
3 mg kg71, b.i.d., for 5 days resulted in a signi®cant increase in

cr faecal excretion in squirrel monkeys

in the control group, oral administration of 1% methocel (4 ± 5
days b.i.d.) resulted in excretion of faecal 51cr of 0.58+0.11%
over 24 h (n=10). dfu at 100 mg kg71 for 5 days resulted in
0.97+0.47% (n=3) excretion, a value not signi®cantly dierent from the methocel control. plasma concentrations of drug
were 10.3 mm 1 h after the last dose. in contrast, the nonselective nsaid diclofenac at 1 mg kg71, b.i.d., for 4 days,
resulted in a signi®cant 24 h 51cr excretion of 1.91+0.70%
(n=6; p50.05 compared with methocel controls) (figure 9),
with a plasma concentration of 0.4 mm at 1 h (no drug detectable at 8 h). similarly, naproxen at 5 mg kg71 for 5 days
b.i.d. caused a signi®cant excretion of 2.21+0.20% (n=4) of
the administered radioactivity, with a plasma concentration of
193 mm at 1 h after the last dose.

discussion
the anti-in¯ammatory agent dup 697 (gans et al., 1990) has
been the prototype for a series of diaryl tricyclic selective
cox-2 inhibitors containing thiophene (bertenshaw et al.,
1995; leblanc et al., 1995), pyrroles (wilkerson et al., 1995),
benzene (li et al., 1996),  xxxd3045xxx  (e.g. sc-58125) (seibert et
al., 1994), cyclopentene (e.g. sc-57666) (reitz et al., 1994) or
various heterocycles (gauthier et al., 1996) as the central ring.
dfu is a structurally related analogue containing a 5,5-dimethyl furanone ring, which has been optimized for potency
and selectivity of inhibition of cox-2 by use of a variety of
enzyme, cell-based and in vivo assays.
the results of this study are consistent with the inhibition of
puri®ed cox-2 by dfu occurring via a two-step mechanism
characterized by a relatively high ki value for rapid reversible
binding (140 mm) followed by a slow (t1/2=6 s) isomerisation
to a tightly bound complex (ei*) with an overall dissociation
constant for inhibition of approximately 0.21 mm. in contrast,
inhibition of puri®ed human cox-1 by dfu is much weaker,
rapidly reversible and detectable only at low  xxxd208xxx 
concentrations. if competitive inhibition is assumed, the ic50
value (60 mm) measured for cox-1 at low substrate concentration should approximate the ki value for inhibitor
binding. considering the similarity of the ki values for cox-1
and cox-2, the selectivity of dfu for cox-2 relies on the
slow formation of the tight ei* complex. this mechanism results in a highly selective cox-2 inhibition that translates in
the various enzyme and cell assays.
the dierence between the mechanism of inhibition of
cox-1 and cox-2 observed for dfu has been noted previously for other selective cox-2 inhibitors (copeland et al.,
1994; ouellet & percival, 1995) and makes it dicult to determine accurately the selectivity ratio of the various cox
inhibitors. in the present assay procedures for inhibition of
cox-2, compounds were preincubated with enzymes or cells
before the addition of  xxxd208xxx , conditions which favour inhibition by time-dependent inhibitors (harris callan et
al., 1996). because  xxxd208xxx  delayed time-dependent
inhibition of cox-2 by dfu, the eectiveness of dfu should
depend on both  xxxd208xxx  concentration and its time of
supply during cox-2 induction. this is a complex situation
for cox-2 since cellular endogenous  xxxd208xxx  appears
to be channelled to enzyme following cellular stimulation by

mitogens or lps (herschman, 1996). the fact that dfu can
inhibit 100% of lps-induced pge2 synthesis in whole blood
assays (where plasma concentrations of  xxxd208xxx  have
been shown to increase to 15 mm, brideau et al., 1996) and
shows ecacy in various in vivo models of in¯ammation indicates that the kinetic characteristics of cox-2 inhibition by
this compound allow eective inhibition of the activity of the
inducible enzyme.
dfu did not cause inhibition of prostanoid synthesis
(ic50450 mm) in several cox-1 mediated assays including the
production of pge2 by  xxxd208xxx -stimulated cho[cox-1] transfected cells or u937 cells, the release of txb2 by

ca2+ ionophore-challenged human platelets and the production of txb2 following blood coagulation. however, inhibition of txb2 by dfu could be observed with platelets
challenged with 1 mm  xxxd208xxx  or in assays with puri®ed cox-1 or u937 cell microsomes at a low  xxxd208xxx 
concentration (ic50s=10 ± 60 mm). assays at low arachidonic
acid concentration permitted the detection of cox-1 inhibition with all selective cox-2 inhibitors tested and such assays
were found to be useful in the comparison of their relative
potencies as cox-1 inhibitors. sc-57666, cgp 28238,  xxxd2065xxx  and sc-58125 were found to be about 10 fold more
potent cox-1 inhibitors than dfu in such assays.

dfu is active with high potency in dierent in vivo models
of acute in¯ammation, pyresis and hyperalgesia with an approximate ed50 value of 1 mg kg71. at this dose, the plasma
concentration of dfu is below the detection limit of the
h.p.l.c. system (50.2 mm) and is below that required to inhibit
platelet cox-1 (ic50497 mm in human cox-1 whole blood
assay). thus, it is quite clear, at least in animal models, that
inhibition of cox-1 is not required to achieve anti-in¯ammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic eects, consistent with
the hypothesis that cox-2 plays a dominant role in acute
in¯ammation. in addition to acute in¯ammation and pain,
dfu is also active in a model of chronic arthritic in¯ammation (visco et al., 1996), supporting a role of cox-2 in chronic
in¯ammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
the major dierence between cox-2 inhibitors and nonselective nsaids is that cox-2 inhibitors have a good separation between their functional ecacy and ulcerogenic
potentials. cox-1 is the major cox isozyme present in the
gastrointestinal tract of many species (kargman et al.,

1996a) and ulcerogenic sparing selective cox-2 inhibitors do
not inhibit stomach pge2 production in contrast to nonselective nsaids (futaki et al., 1993a; masferrer et al.,
1994; chan et al., 1995).  xxxd2727xxx  (magni, 1993; tavares
et al., 1995),  xxxd2065xxx  (glaser et al., 1995; laine et al., 1995),
 xxxd2561xxx  (engelhardt et al., 1996) and cgp 28238 (klein
et al., 1994) have been shown to inhibit preferentially cox-2
and to show an improved gastrointestinal tolerability as
compared to non-selective nsaids. it should be noted that
a higher degree of selectivity for cox-2 was observed in the
cho cell assays (90 to 1000 fold) than in whole blood assays where selectivity ratios of 6 to 43 fold have been obtained for these compounds (glaser et al., 1995; young et
al., 1996; brideau et al., 1996; noble & balfour, 1996), as
compared to 4350 fold for dfu. in the u937 microsomal
cox-1 assay,  xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  were about 100
times more potent inhibitors than dfu, while  xxxd2065xxx  and
cgp 28238 were about 10 times more potent. ed50 values
for gastric ulceration in rats of 2.5 mg kg71 day71 and of
30 mg kg71 have been determined for  xxxd2561xxx  (engelhardt et al., 1995) and  xxxd2065xxx  (melarange et al., 1995),

100 mg kg71 day71 have been determined for a faecal blood
loss by cgp 28238 (wiesenberg-bottcher et al., 1989) and
 xxxd2727xxx  (carr et al., 1986). when administered orally at
200 mg kg71 day71 for 5 days, dfu had no detectable ulcerogenic eect in rats in a sensitive faecal 51cr excretion
assay which measures the integrity of the gastrointestinal
tract. this would give dfu a margin of safety of greater
than 200 fold between ecacy (ed50%1 mg kg71) and ulcerogenicity (threshold dose 4200 mg kg71), in marked
contrast to indomethacin or diclofenac which have a narrow
margin of safety in these animal studies. the ulcerogenic
sparing eect of dfu was observed not only in rats, but
also in squirrel monkeys. the present ®ndings with dfu are
in accord with the notion that the inhibition of cox-1 is a
major contributing factor in nsaid-induced gastropathy.
however, cox-1-de®cient mice have been shown recently to
have no gastric pathology and to be less sensitive to indomethacin-induced ulceration than wild type mice (langenbach et al., 1995), suggesting that either compensatory
mechanisms for cytoprotection are present in the transgenic
