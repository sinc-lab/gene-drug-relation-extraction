abstract
dna methylation abnormalities have recently emerged as one of the most frequent molecular changes in hematopoietic neoplasms. since
methylation and transcriptional status are inversely correlated, the hypermethylation of genes involved in cell-cycle control and apoptosis could
have a pathogenetic role in the development of cancer. in particular, high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) and secondary leukemias show
a high prevalence of tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. the progression of chronic myeloproliferative diseases and of myelodysplastic
syndromes, as well as that of lymphoproliferative diseases, is associated with an increased methylation rate, pointing to a role for hypermethylation
of critical promoter regions in the transformation to more aggressive phenotypes. in the same line, a significantly worse prognosis has been shown
for patients with hypermethylation of several genes compared to that of patients with unmethylated genes. for these reasons, the use of irreversible
dna methyltransferase inhibitors, such as 5- xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx , appears to be a promising option for the treatment of mds and acute
myeloid leukemia. in clinical trials,  xxxd253xxx  results in a significantly higher response rate, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic
transformation, and improved survival compared to supportive care. similarly,  xxxd1823xxx  showed favorable results, promising response rates, a
good nonhematologic toxicity profile, and a trend for better survival compared to intensive chemotherapy, particularly in older patients. the
synergistic effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors, including phenyl butirate (pb), in reactivating silenced genes encouraged clinical studies on the
combination of pb and demethylating agents in hematological diseases, characterized by p15 silencing. the sequential administration of a “first
generation” demethylating agent and hdac inhibitors gave preliminary evidence of a reduced methylation of target genes, as also described with
 xxxd1823xxx . clinical trials are still ongoing, and preliminary data indicate for the first time that the natural history of mds may be changed by a
non-intensive treatment, characterized by an outstanding toxicity profile.

introduction
like other neoplasms, the dna methylation profile of
hematological malignancies is frequently characterized by
global hypomethylation and simultaneous hypermethylation
of selected cpg island gene promoters [1,2]. both dna
hypermethylation and hypomethylation have been considered trigger events in determining hematological neoplasms
[3,4]. in transgenic mice, with a severe (90%) deficiency of
methyltransferase, dna hypomethylation is sufficient to

induce t-cell lymphomas associated with a consistent gain
of chromosome 15 [5], while treatment with the demethylating agent 5- xxxd253xxx  induces a thymic lymphoma [6].
on the other hand, cpg island hypermethylation has been
shown to induce epigenetic silencing of some tumor suppressor genes, favoring tumorigenesis [1,2]. hypermethylation can be reversed by demethylating agents.

methylation in myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic
syndromes
aberrant dna hypermethylation is thought to be relevant for leukemogenesis [3]. several groups have shown

90

g. leone et al. / clinical immunology 109 (2003) 89 –102

that acute myeloid leukemia (aml) cells present several
methylation lesions. melki et al. [7] found that 19 of 20
(95%) aml samples had an abnormal methylation pattern
of at least one gene, and 15 of 20 (75%) had abnormal
methylation patterns of two or more of the target genes.
concurrent hypermethylation was further confirmed by
some studies providing assessment of overall methylation
changes by means of restriction landmark genomic scanning
(rlgs) [8]. in contrast to techniques that allow assessment
of the methylation status of individual genes, rlgs is a tool
for the identification of genome-wide methylation changes
in cpg islands, regardless of whether the genomic sequence
is known. using this technique, a preferential methylation
of chromosome 11 was found [8]. thus, in a subset of aml
cases, a methylator phenotype could be hypothesized
[8 –10], characterized by hypermethylation of different
genes, including the  xxxg730xxx  (er), pmdr1,
 xxxg307xxx , mint1, mint2,  xxxg10xxx ,  xxxg2278xxx , and  xxxg1867xxx ,
 xxxg1493xxx , pitx2, gpr37, and sdc4.
some of the most frequently examined genes in aml
and in myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are the cyclindependent kinase inhibitors, p15 and p16, and more recently
p21 and p57 [11]. the  xxxg422xxx  gene, and its functional
homologue  xxxg421xxx  gene, encode proteins that negatively
regulate the cell cycle by inhibiting the cyclin-dependent
kinases 4 and 6, and control the progression of cell cycle
from g1 to s phase [12].
the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
(cdki)  xxxg422xxx  (p15) is upregulated during in vitro granulocytic and megakaryocytic differentiation of normal
cd34⫹ hematopoietic progenitors [13]. inactivation of the
 xxxg422xxx  and  xxxg421xxx  genes by homozygous deletion has
been detected in many cancers, suggesting that they are
candidate tumor suppressor genes [14,15]. in hematological
malignancies, homozygous deletion of the  xxxg421xxx /
p15ikn4b gene is a frequent event in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (all) and non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl)
[16,17], but rarely occurs in myeloid malignancies [18,19].
hypermethylation is an alternative mode of p15 inactivation. aberrant methylation of cpg islands in the p15 promoter region commonly occurs in mds, such as refractory
anemia with excess of blasts (raeb) or raeb in transformation (raeb-t), and is associated with loss of p15 expression [20,21]. patients with p15ikn4b methylation at diagnosis had a significantly shorter survival than those with a
normal methylation pattern [22]. the incidence of  xxxg422xxx 
gene methylation also detected in “low-risk” diseases (ra
and rars), without blast excess, or “high-risk” mds
(raeb, raeb-t, and cmml), respectively, is constant
during the course of the disease [22]. using a methylationsensitive pcr, p15 methylation was not detectable throughout the course of “low-risk” mds, while in “high-risk”
mds if ranged from 23% at diagnosis to 30% at advanced
stages [22]. acquisition of  xxxg422xxx  methylation during
follow-up mirrored disease progression [20 –22].  xxxg422xxx 
methylation ranged from 60 to 75% in aml, evolving from

a previous mds. patients with  xxxg422xxx  gene methylation at
diagnosis or at follow-up had a significantly higher chance
of disease progression to aml than those without gene
methylation [22]. this suggests that  xxxg422xxx  gene methylation might play an important role not only in disease
progression, but also in the early development of some highrisk mds (reviewed in 23), also indicating p15 methylation
as a marker of leukemic transformation in mds [21–23].
methylation may also play a role in therapy-related leukemias. in patients with therapy-related leukemia, the frequent microsatellite instability could be related to the deficiency of genes involved in dna mismatch repair ( xxxg1447xxx 
and mlh1) [24 –27] or to their silencing by methylation.
we found mlh1 hypermethylation in patients with therapy-related leukemia, but not in patients with de novo leukemia [28]. the significance of the methylated region of the
 xxxg1413xxx  promoter is uncertain, however, some recent results
confirm that, in some patients with aml, extensive methylation of  xxxg1413xxx , but not of  xxxg1447xxx , may occur, and as is
the case of solid tumors, this can be associated with the
presence of a defective dna mismatch repair pathway,
resulting in msi [29]. p15 methylation in de novo and
therapy-related mds/leukemia could be related to the presence of chromosomal aberrations, such as monosomy/deletion of chromosome 7q [30].
p15 methylation is a frequent finding also in de novo
acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) and could be related to
an increased dna methyltransferase activity [31–33]. using a methylation-specific pcr, it was observed that the
 xxxg422xxx  gene was methylated in 24 of 33 (72%) aml
cases [33], and amls with methylated  xxxg422xxx  tended to
express higher levels of dna methyltransferase (dnm) t1
and 3b. thus, dnmts were substantially overexpressed in
leukemic cells in a leukemia type- and stage- specific manner and may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia by
inducing aberrant regional hypermethylation [33].
furthermore, aberrant hypermethylation, and the consequent  xxxg422xxx  tumor suppressor gene inactivation, is
found in at least half of patients with chronic myelogenous
leukemia [34]. during the progression of cml, the  xxxg23xxx 
promoter of the bcr–abl fusion gene becomes significantly hypermethylated [35,36], although this was not confirmed by highly sensitive methylation assays [37]. using
real-time pcr, homozygous p16 deletions were found in 6
of 21 patients (29%) with lymphoid blast crisis (bc),
whereas they were not observed in chronic-phase cml nor
in 21 myeloid bc patients [38]. yet hypermethylation of the
p16 gene was not detected in any of the lymphoid bc [38].
no specific clinical profile was associated with homozygous
p16 deletions [38]. aberrant methylation is found also in
ph-negative myeloproliferative diseases and could be an
initial event, triggering the occurrence of the t(9;22) translocation and its clinical expression [39]. most of the cpg
sites of the promoter area of the  xxxg1223xxx   xxxg1966xxx  gene were found
methylated in cml and  xxxg1223xxx   xxxg1966xxx  expression was downregulated, due to the inactivation of the  xxxg1223xxx   xxxg1966xxx  gene by methyl-

g. leone et al. / clinical immunology 109 (2003) 89 –102

ation [40]. transgenic mice, specifically lacking  xxxg1223xxx   xxxg1966xxx  expression in the myeloid lineage, were shown to develop a
myeloproliferative disease, eventually progressing to blast
crisis, that resembled human cml [40].
an elegant study by di croce et al. [41] recently established, for the first time, a mechanistic link between genetic
and epigenetic changes in leukomogenesis. the authors
demonstrated that, in acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl),
the leukemia-promoting pml–rar␣ fusion protein induces gene hypermethylation and silencing by recruiting
 xxxg644xxx  and  xxxg645xxx  to the promoter of its target gene
rar␣2. the mechanism of transcription repression exerted
by pml–rara was the recruitment of hdac complex
[42]. consistent with this finding, di croce et al. [41]
showed that pml–rar␣-induced repression of rar␤2
was only partially relieved by either 5-aza-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx 
(5aza) or trikostatin (tsa) treatment of apl cells. notably, only simultaneous treatment with 5-aza-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx  and tsa completely restored rar␤2 gene expression
[41]. moreover, chim et al. [43] reported a high incidence
of p15 methylation in patients with apl and demonstrated
that the 5-year disease-free survival (dsf) of patients with
abnormal p15 methylation was significantly worse than that
of patients without p15 methylation. these data were confirmed by our recent work showing that apl patients with
fully methylated p15 had a negative prognosis, in particular
in those cases in which p15 methylation was associated with
absent expression [44].
thus, all these observations, taken together, suggest the
intriguing scenario in which the newly methylated cpgs
become docking sites for methyl-binding proteins, which in
turn interact with both hdac complexes and dnmts,
finally leading to the spread of hypermethylation to the
neighboring dna regions.

methylation in lymphoid malignancies
dna methylation is common in patients with all, both
adults [45] and children [46]. in adults, mean methylation
density of  xxxg10xxx ,  xxxg2279xxx ,  xxxg1493xxx , er, p15,  xxxg2278xxx ,  xxxg1417xxx ,
 xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx , and p16 was 24.5, 20.8, 17.6, 16.1, 11.3, 8.9, 4.5,
3.7, and 1.3%, respectively. p73 was methylated in 17 of 80
cases (21.2%). eighty-six percent of the cases had methylation of at least one gene, and 42.5% of three or more genes.
 xxxg10xxx  methylation inversely correlated with age (p ⫽ 0.01)
and  xxxg1417xxx  methylation inversely correlated to  xxxg1417xxx  expression (p ⫽ 0.0001).  xxxg10xxx  and  xxxg2278xxx  methylation was
inversely associated with the presence of the philadelphia
chromosome, whereas  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx  methylation correlated with
the presence of the p210 variant of the philadelphia chromosome. in univariate analysis, methylation of  xxxg2278xxx  was
associated with a favorable outcome (p ⫽ 0.02), whereas
methylation of p73, p15, and  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx  was associated with a
trend toward worse prognosis. in conclusion, aberrant dna
methylation of promoter-associated cpg islands is very

91

common in adult all and potentially defines subgroups
with distinct clinical and biological characteristics [45].
similar results were found in children [46], indicating
that methylation of the genes studied does not account for
prognostic differences between pediatric and adult patients
with all.
methylation of the cell cycle control genes p15 and p16
was also found in about 20% of patients with t-cell leukemia-lymphoma [47] and in a high proportion (40%) of
nhls [48]. methylation was detected when any histological
or molecular evidence of disease was present, suggesting a
good correlation between methylation and disease. in a few
cases methylation was detected in patients in complete remission and without evidence of a monoclonal cell population, indicating a high sensitivity of the pcr to detect
methylation. these results suggest that  xxxg421xxx  and
 xxxg422xxx  methylation could be helpful in identifying lymphoma patients at risk of relapse [48].
p16 and p15 methylation was also detected in about 40%
of patients with hodgkin’s disease. methylation incidence
within cases at diagnosis and at relapse suggests that this is
an early event in the progression of hodgkin’s disease to
anaplastic large-cell lymphomas [49].
p15( xxxg422xxx ) and p16( xxxg421xxx ) biallelic gene abnormalities are common in extranodal lymphoma as primary cutaneous b cell lymphomas [50], malt lymphoma [51], and
primary central nervous system lymphoma [52]. the presence of abnormalities in recurrent disease and diseapperance in remission suggests that p15 and p16 inactivation
may be involved in disease progression.
inactivation of the  xxxg421xxx  gene by promoter methylation was found also in burkitt lymphoma [53] furthermore
all burkitt’s lymphomas and 84% of the b-cell nonhodgkin’s lymphomas were found hypermethylated in the
dap-kinase cpg island; in contrast, none of the t-cell
non-hodgkin’s lymphoma samples and 15% or less of leukemia samples examined had hypermethylated dap-kinase
alleles [54].
methylation of the p16 gene is a frequent event in myeloma [55] and is associated with an increased proliferative
rate of plasma cells and a poor prognosis, indicating an
important role for the p16 gene in the cell-cycle regulation
of myeloma cells and in the clinical outcome of the disease
[56].
dna methylation and silencing of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p57( xxxg420xxx ) is frequently found in primary
diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (b-dlcl) (54.9%), in follicular lymphoma (44.0%) [57], and all (50%) [58] but
was infrequent in myelodysplastic syndromes and adult
t-cell leukemias (3 and 2%, respectively) [57].
in b-dlcl the gene encoding the dna repair enzyme
o(6)- methylguanine dna methyltransferase (mgmt) is
transcriptionally silenced by promoter hypermethylation
[59]. esteller and others [59] showed that mgmt promoter
hypermethylation was associated with a statistically significant increase in overall survival and progression-free sur-

g. leone et al. / clinical immunology 109 (2003) 89 –102

 xxxd1866xxx . mgmt promoter hypermethylation was an independent prognostic factor compared to age, disease stage,
serum lactic dehydrogenase level, and performance status.
in llc, tumor suppressor genes within chromosal band
13q14.3 were found unmethylated [60], but in ritcher transformation,  xxxg1413xxx  promoter hypermethylation, associated
with a high level of microsatellite instability, was found
[61].
it is noteworthy that treatment with 5-aza-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx  of methylated/silenced cell lines or primary cells resulted in gene reexpression [45– 47,49,50,54].

rationale for the use of demethylating agents in
haematological malignancies
cytosine methylation is an epigenetic process that may
be modulated by biochemical and biological manipulations.
the inhibition of methyltransferase does result in reactivation of silenced genes [62]. dna hypomethylating agents
are effective in vitro and in vivo in reducing hypermethylation in patients affected by cancer, leukemia, myelodysplasia, and lymphoma [63]. the demethylating agents 5azacytidine and 5-aza-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx / xxxd1823xxx  can restore the normal demethylated state of several types of
tumor suppressor genes, including p16, p15,e-cadherin,
 xxxg1413xxx , and vhl, increasing their expression in vitro
[49,63– 64] and in vivo [65]. still, mds cd34⫹ cells only
poorly differentiate to the megakaryocytic lineage following
demethylation with  xxxd253xxx  [66]. thus, it is possible
that the profound proliferation, survival, and differentiation
defect of the neoplastic clone cannot be completely overcome, but only suppressed, by this demethylating drug
alone.
in vivo, however, treatment of mds patients with the
demethylating drug  xxxd1823xxx  often results in an early and
sometimes massive increase in platelet counts [67]. considering that dna methylation and histone deacetylation act as
synergistic layers in gene silencing in cancer (see fig. 3),
the combination of demethylating agents with acetylation
inhibitors could be a logical approach [68]. the in vitro
antineoplastic activity of 5aza, alone and in combination
with the histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdi), tsa, and
 xxxd1841xxx  ( xxxd3144xxx , depsi), was assayed on the human
myeloid leukemic cell lines hl-60 and kg1a [69]. the
combination of 5aza with tsa or  xxxd1841xxx  produced a
greater inhibition of growth and dna synthesis and a
greater loss of clonogenicity than either agent alone. these
results suggest that 5aza used in combination with hdi
may be an interesting treatment regimen in patients with
acute myeloid leukemia resistant to conventional chemotherapy.
on the other hand, demethylating drugs could possibly
be a double-edged sword, at least in patients with a longterm prognosis, such as in the apcmin mouse model [70], in
which genomic demethylation may protect against some

fig. 1. structure of cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, and demethylating 5-methylcytidine analogs.

cancers, such as intestinal tumors, and simultaneously
favour lymphomagenesis [70]. however, in different mouse
models, demethylation may promote genomic instability [4]
and even increase the risk of cancer in other tissues, as seen
in the severely “hypomethylated” mutant mice, in which
t-cell lymphoma was induced at high frequency [5,6].
therefore, cytogenetics should be carefully monitored in
clinical trials, for possible chromosomal instability, which
may occur following prolonged treatament [71].

chemical structure and mechanisms of action of
demethylating agents
the cytidine analogues modified in position 5 of the
pyrimidine ring, such as 5- xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ), 5-aza2⬘ xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ), pseudoisocytidine, and 5⬘fluoro-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx  are potent inhibitors of dna methylation (fig. 1).  xxxd1823xxx  has the highest efficacy [72].
the hypomethylating effect of cytidine analogues appears
to depend primarily on the presence of an altered c5 position; other cytidine analogues, such as  xxxd1790xxx , 6- xxxd253xxx ,
and gemcitabine, do not possess this property. arabinofuranosyl-5- xxxd253xxx  (fazarabine) showed a broad antitumor activity in experimental models, but not in clinical trials
[73].
 xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx , both synthesized by sorm
and coworkers in 1964 [74,75], are characterized by a
strong in vitro and in vivo antileukemic effect at high
concentrations, while showing a differentiation-inducing
activity at lower concentrations in cell line models [75–77]
and primary myeloid leukemic blasts [78]. thus, the efficacy of  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  as antineoplastic agents
appears to result from two distinct mechanisms: cytotoxicity
(high dose) and induction of hypomethylation, leading to
cellular effects that are distinct from immediate cytotoxicity

activity [68]. through inhibition of dna methylation,  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx , also at low doses, induce reexpression of silenced genes [62].  xxxd1823xxx , at concentrations
inhibiting dna methylation, is 30-fold more active than
 xxxd253xxx  [85]. the combination of hdac inhibitors with
 xxxd253xxx / xxxd1823xxx  is synergistic in reactivation of silenced genes (fig. 3).

clinical studies with  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  in
hematological malignancies

fig. 2. 5-methylcytosine differs from cytosine by the presence of a methyl
group at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. dna methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from the methyl-donor  xxxd3156xxx  into the 5⬘ position in the cytosine ring.  xxxd253xxx  and
 xxxd1823xxx  may also exert antitumor activity through induction of dna
hypomethylation, by forming a covalent complex with the major dna
methyltransferase (now termed  xxxg644xxx ).

(low dose). both compounds are activated to triphosphate
( xxxd253xxx  by uridine-cytidine kinase,  xxxd1823xxx  by  xxxg611xxx ) and are degraded by  xxxg400xxx .  xxxd253xxx , being a  xxxd2246xxx , incorporates into
rna and, to a lesser extent, into dna.  xxxd1823xxx  only
incorporates into dna. incorporation into rna produces
disassembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and
acceptor function of transfer rna, and marked inhibition of
protein production. insertion into dna results in covalent
linking with dna methyltransferases and blocking of dna
synthesis [79], which ultimately result in cytotoxicity.
 xxxd253xxx  is higly cytotoxic to cells in s phase and
mainly exerts its action on rapidly dividing cells. unlike
 xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd253xxx ,  xxxd1823xxx  does not block cell progression to s phase, suggesting that the cytotoxic activity is
not self-limiting. this indicates that  xxxd1823xxx  has a higher
in vivo cytotoxicicity than  xxxd1790xxx  or  xxxd253xxx  [80].
both  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  may also exert antitumor activity through induction of dna hypomethylation,
by forming a covalent complex with the major dna methyltransferase (now termed  xxxg644xxx ). dna methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl-group from the
methyl-donor  xxxd3156xxx  into the 5⬘ position in
the cytosine ring (fig. 2).  xxxg644xxx  is responsible for duplicating the dna methylation pattern during dna replication
[81].
 xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  effectively deplete the cell of
functional dna methylating activity, which results in profound hypomethylation after several rounds of dna replication (fig. 2).  xxxg644xxx  is considered a bona fide anticancer
target at different levels [82]. it induces dna methylation,
but in addition contains two domains that can recruit histone
deacetylase (hdac)1 [83] and  xxxg1034xxx  [84]. drugs inhibiting histone deacetylation could further reduce  xxxg644xxx 

although hypermethylation has been demonstrated in
most hematological malignancies, so far clinical studies
have been performed in mds and in acute and chronic
myeloid leukemias only. preliminary studies, initiated many
years ago (using  xxxd253xxx  in the us and  xxxd1823xxx  in
canada and europe, mostly designed before the discovery
of the demethylating activity of these drugs), showed promising results in high-risk mds and resistant or relapsed
leukemias [reviewed in 86]. other studies published after
1984 by the cancer and leukemia group b (calgb)
showed a 50% efficacy in mds patients treated with lowdose  xxxd253xxx  [87]. in a single-arm phase i/ii trial on
patients with mostly raeb and raeb-t, using monthly
 xxxd253xxx , 75 mg/m2/day continuous infusion for 7 days,
49% of patients responded, with 37% having trilineage
responses, either complete or partial. complete remission
was achieved by 5 of 43 patients and partial remission by 11
patients. patients who did not respond after 4 months were
discontinued from the study. median survival for all patients was 13.3 months, while median remission duration
was 14.7 months (table 1). interestingly, the best response
was observed after a mean of 3.8 treatment courses (range
2–11 courses), indicating that  xxxd253xxx  may need repeated applications to achieve maximum efficacy. the most
frequent side effects were nausea and/or vomiting (63%),
followed by diarrhea (30%) [87].
a subsequent study (calgb 8921 trial), using subcutaneous bolus injection of  xxxd253xxx  with the identical total
dose of 525 mg/m2 per course, also produced a response in
about 50% of patients, with 27% having trilineage responses (table 1) [88]. a mild activity, without significant
myelosuppression, was demonstrated in myelodysplastic
syndromes using a lower dose of  xxxd253xxx  (15 mg/m2/
day for 14 days, i.e., 210 mg/m2 total dose) [89].
these promising results led to a phase iii calgb trial.
in this randomized controlled trial [90], 191 patients with
mds were enrolled: aza c (75 mg/m2/day sc for 7 days
every 28 days) was compared to supportive care. only
patients without previous treatment were enrolled. patients
with ra and rars had to have symptomatic anemia requiring rbc transfusions for at least 3 months before study

fig. 3. the dna methyltransferases, dnmts, are the enzymes responsible for methylating dna in mammals. dna methylation silences the expression of
multiple tumor suppressor genes in many types of tumors by inducing repressive chromatin structures mediated by binding of methylated dna to
methyl-cpg binding proteins, mecp2,  xxxg649xxx , mbd2, and mbd3, all associated with histone deacetylase (hdac) activity and chromatin remodeling
factors. treatment with dna demethylating drugs ( xxxd253xxx ,  xxxd1823xxx ) reactivates the expression of silenced, methylated tumor suppressor genes by
alleviating methylation-mediated repression. combination of hdac inhibitors with a low dose of  xxxd1823xxx  is synergic in reactivation of silenced genes

improved) and in 5% (improved) of those receiving supportive care (p ⬍ 0.001). median time to leukemic transformation or death was 21 months for aza c versus 13
months for supportive care (p ⬍ 0.007). transformation to
acute myelogenous leukemia occurred as the first event in
15% of patients on aza c and 38% of patients receiving
supportive care (p ⬍ 0.001), suggesting that  xxxd253xxx 
may prevent leukemic transformation. most patients responded by the third or fourth month. this is consistent with
a low-dose cytotoxic effect and to aza c acting as a biologic response modifier. eliminating the confounding effect

of early cross-over to-aza c, a landmark analysis after 6
months showed median survival of an additional 18 months
for aza c and 11 months for supportive care (p ⬍ 0.03). a
quality-of-life analysis showed that patients initially treated
with  xxxd253xxx  had a significant improvement over time in
fatigue, dyspnea, physical functioning, and physiological
distress compared to those receiving supportive care only
(table 2) [91]. in conclusion, aza c treatment, compared to
supportive care, results in a significantly higher response
rate, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic
transformation, and improved survival. this study shows
for the first time that the natural history of mds may be
changed by a nonintensive drug treatment [90,91].
low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  was first employed in the treatment
of mds and leukemia by the aviano group in italy [92].
ten patients affected by advanced mds, two with raeb
and eight with raeb-t, were treated with  xxxd1823xxx  at a
daily dose of 45 mg/m2, divided into three 4-h infusions for
3 days (6 patients, total dose 135 mg/m2) or of 50 mg/m2
given as continuous infusion for 3 days (4 patients, 150
mg/m2). treatment with  xxxd1823xxx  resulted in over 50% of
patients in a significant increase in circulating neutrophils,
platelets, and hemoglobin compared to pretreatment values.
these changes were associated with an improved bone
marrow myeloid “relative differentiation index” (median
fivefold increase in the whole group of patients) and myeloid-to-erythroid cell ratio (median twofold increase) in
most of the patients. four of 10 patients showed a complete
peripheral blood and bone marrow normalization (complete
hematologic response). a slow, but progressive reduction of
early leukemic progenitors was observed in most patients. a
transient slight bone marrow hypoplasia occurred in less
than 50% of patients, while a severe marrow aplasia was
never observed. extra-hematological toxicity was mild in
all patients [92].
a considerable activity of high-dose  xxxd1823xxx  was also
demonstrated in leukemic patients [93]. a total of 12 patients with poor prognosis leukemia, mostly secondary to
mds, were treated with  xxxd1823xxx  at 90 –120 mg/m2 as a
4-h intravenous infusion, three times daily for 3 consecutive
days every 4 to 6 weeks (810 and 1080 mg/m2 total dose,
respectively) [92]. a minimum of two courses was required
for response evaluation. ten patients were fully evaluable
for response: three patients achieved complete remission

95

(cr) and one patient achieved partial remission (pr). extrahematological toxicity was generally mild. as for the
mechanism of action, both a differentiation effect and, not
unexpectedly, cytotoxicity were observed. in particular,
crs and prs appeared to be also due to a differentiation
effect of leukemic cells, as suggested by the slow remission
kinetic and by immunophenotyping studies [94]. these data
were confirmed by wijermans et al. [95] using a low-dose
schedule. 5-aza-2⬘-  xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ) at low
doses (120 –225 mg/m2 total dose), as 72-h continuous infusion, was tested in a group of 29 elderly patients with
high-risk mds. in 15 patients (54%) a response was observed, with 8 cr, including patients with “negative” cytogenetics. the actuarial median survival from the start of
therapy was 46 weeks. the only (and major) toxicity was
myelosuppression, leading to a prolonged cytopenia and to
five toxic deaths (17%) in this high-risk patient group. it
was concluded that  xxxd1823xxx  is an effective drug in the
treatment of mds especially at the higher dose schedule.
myelotoxicity is the major adverse effect. the same group
confirmed these data in a multicentric study [96]. between
june 1996 and september 1997, 66 patients (median age, 68
years) from seven centers in the netherlands, belgium, and
germany received  xxxd1823xxx  45 mg/m2/day (administered
as three 15 mg/m2 infusions given over 4 h) for 3 days every
6 weeks (total dose 135 mg/m2, as in the aviano trial of
mds [92]). for patients who achieved complete remission
after two courses, two further cycles were administered as
consolidation therapy. in cases of stable disease, improvement, or partial response, a maximum of six cycles was
administered. the primary end-points were response rate
and toxicity. the secondary end-points were response duration, survival from the start of therapy, and overall survival. the overall response rate was 49%, with a 64%
response rate in patients with a high-risk international prognostic scoring system (ipss) [97], and a response duration
of 39 and 36 weeks for patients who reached pr or cr,
respectively (table 3). the actuarial median survival from
diagnosis was 22 months and from the start of therapy was
15 months. for the ipss high-risk group, the median survival was 14 months. the median progression-free survival
was 25 weeks. myelosuppression was rather common; the

treatment-related mortality rate was 7% and was primarily
associated to pancytopenia and infections. significant responses were observed with regard to megakaryopoiesis,
with increases in platelet counts occurring after one cycle of
 xxxd1823xxx  therapy in the majority of responding patients. in
summary,  xxxd1823xxx  therapy was effective in half of the
patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and was
especially active in those with the worst prognoses. myelosuppression was the only major adverse effect [96].
in a recent update, data of 162 uniformly decitabinetreated mds patients with a median age of 70 years (ipss
score int-1, n ⫽ 45; int-2, n ⫽ 47; and high-risk, n ⫽ 70)
were analyzed [98]. the response rate to  xxxd1823xxx  was
49%. thirty-one patients experienced progressive disease,
often during the first two cycles, and 30 patients had stable
disease. the response rate of the different ipss subgroups
was as follows: int-1, 44%; int-2, 51%; and high-risk, 51%.
patients over 75 years of age had the same response rate of
patients between 65 and 75 or below 65 years of age. a
remarkable effect on platelet counts was observed, with a
significant platelet increase in 42% of patients after one
cycle of therapy and in 63% of patients receiving at least
two cycles. the median response duration was 36 weeks
(95% ci 31.9 – 40.1 weeks), with response duration for the
different ipss groups as follows: int-1, 46 weeks; int-2, 38
weeks; and high-risk, 36 weeks. the median survival was
15 months (95% ci 12.1–17.9 months) with a 2-year survival of 34% (ipss: int-1, 23 months and 48%; int-2, 15
months and 24%; and high-risk 12 months and 27%). age
was not a significant prognostic factor for survival. patients
with a blast cell count ⬎20% and those with high-risk
cytogenetic abnormalities had a somewhat inferior survival
(median 11 months, 2-year survival 23% compared to 15
months and 27% survival) [98]. the incidence and kinetics
of cytogenetic responses in mds following  xxxd1823xxx  was
also examined [71]. of 115 successfully karyotyped patients, 61 (53%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities
prior to treatment. major cytogenetic responses were observed in 19 patients (31% of those with abnormal cytogenetics, 17% of all patients by intention-to-treat) after a
median of three courses (range, 2– 6), until best cytogenetic
response (i.e., approximately 18 weeks). median cytogenetic response duration was 7.5 months (range, 3–15).
grouping patients by ipss, 3/5 cytogenetic responses
(60%) were obtained in the ipss low-risk group, 6/30 in the
intermediate-risk (20%), and 10/26 in the high-risk group
(38%). median survival in these subgroups was 30, 8, and
13 months, respectively. the relative risk of death in patients achieving a major cytogenetic response was 0.38
(95% ci 0.17– 0.88) compared to that of patients with persistently abnormal cytogenetics (p ⫽ 0.0213). in conclusion, repeated courses of low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  induce cytogenetic remission in a substantial number of elderly mds
patients with preexisting chromosomal abnormalities, with
a significantly better survival for patients achieving major
cytogenetic response. of note, the initial cytogenetic abnor-

mality was observed at relapse in the large majority of
cases, arguing against chromosomal destabilization and increased cytogenetic evolution triggered by decytabine [71].
based on these results, low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  appeared
promising also in elderly aml. four patients screened for
three phase ii studies of  xxxd1823xxx  in high-risk mds had
progressed to aml at time of planned treatment start and
were treated with low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  [99]. due to their age
and/or comorbidity (median age 77 years, range, 62–79
years) they were not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.
the median performance status was 2 (range, 1–3), comorbidity included coronary heart disease (two patients), carotid artery stenosis, and cardiac insufficiency. two of four
patients had received previous treatment (low-dose dac
and 6- xxxd2573xxx , respectively). median wbc was
9.7/ml (range, 1.8 –72 ml), median bone marrow blasts 49%
(range, 37–70%), four patients had anemia with hemoglobin
⬍10.5 g/dl, and two patients had thrombocytopenia
(⬍50,000 platelets/␮l). three patients had cytogenetic abnormalities (sole 5q-, sole 7q-, and complex karyotype).
patients received a median of four treatment courses (range,
2– 8), resulting in an antileukemic effect (complete clearance of peripheral blood blasts and ⬎50% reduction of bone
marrow blasts) in two patients. two patients achieved hematologic cr and karyotypic normalization lasting 5 and 11
months, respectively. median survival from dac start to
death or to last follow-up was 9 months (range, 5–20⫹
months). during that time, they spent a median of 66 days
in hospital (range, 57– 101 days), which included all scheduled and unscheduled hospital admissions for any indication
with a 76% median time spent at home. it was concluded
that this low-dose dac schedule can result in hematologic
cr and cytogenetic normalization in selected aml patients
aged ⬎60 years. after brief hospitalization for dac infusions, discharge and outpatient management was feasible,
resulting in a substantial proportion of the remaining lifetime spent at home. a phase ii study of intravenous lowdose decytabine for four coursese, followed by outpatient
mainteinance with this drug, was therefore recently initiated.
reversal of  xxxg422xxx  hypermethylation with generation
of partly demethylated p15 alleles and induction of p15
protein were observed in the bone marrow of mds patients
after the first course of  xxxd1823xxx  treatment [65]. at this
early time point, persistence of an abnormal karyotype was
noted in most cases, suggesting that demethylation occurred
in clonal cells. emergence of fully demethylated p15 alleles
and reversion to normal karyotype with continued treatment
indicated suppression of clonal growth [65,98].
 xxxd1823xxx  has been recently used at a similar total dose
(150 mg/m2 total dose compared to 135 mg/m2 in the
european schedule) in the us [100]. the recommended
(minimal effective) dose of  xxxd1823xxx  was 15 mg/m2 over
1 h, daily for 10 days, resulting in a lower daily dose than
that of the european schedule [98]. a total of 39 patients
(mostly pretreated aml) were enrolled in this study: 36

g. leone et al. / clinical immunology 109 (2003) 89 –102

patients were evaluable, while 3 patients were excluded
from the study (1 patient due to sepsis and death on treatment day 2 and 2 due to rapidly rising blood counts). the
drug was overall well tolerated, with one death due to
neutropenic sepsis and five asymptomatic elevations in
sgpt and/or bilirubin four grade 2, one grade 3). there
were seven complete remissions (19.4%) and seven partial
remissions (19.4%), with a response rate of 39% (95% ci
28 to 61%). seven additional patients had significant reductions in peripheral and/or bone marrow blasts but never had
a normal hematopoiesis. responses were observed in refractory/relapsed aml (10/30), mds (3/4), and cml (2/2).
in most patients who responded, there was a gradual reduction of blasts over 2– 4 weeks, and eventual recovery of
normal hematopoiesis at 4 –5 weeks, suggesting a delayed
cytotoxic mode of action also for this regimen. response
duration ranged between 2 and 10⫹ months. dna methylation studies showed p15 demethylation 5 days after treatment in 2 patients who subsequently achieved remission,
which also indicates that low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  induces remissions in part through demethylation rather than cytotoxicity.
 xxxd1823xxx  has been also utilized in patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia in blastic crisis (bc) [101] a total of 162
adults patients with a diagnosis of nonlymphoid cml-bc
were included in a study of anderson hospital between
1986 and 1997. ninety patients were treated with intensive
chemotherapy, 31 with  xxxd1823xxx , and 41 with other single
agents. thirty-six patients (22%) had an objective response.
response rates were similar in patients treated with intensive chemotherapy (28%) or  xxxd1823xxx  (26%). the median
duration of remission for all patients was 29 weeks and the
median overall survival was 22 weeks. patients treated with
 xxxd1823xxx  showed a trend toward better survival, despite a
higher percentage of older patients (p ⬍ 0.004). the median
survival was 29 weeks in the  xxxd1823xxx  group, 21 weeks
using intensive chemotherapy, and 22 weeks with other
agents. when only older patients were considered, survival
was significantly better in patients treated with  xxxd1823xxx 
versus other treatments (p ⬍ 0.01). a multivariate analysis
confirmed  xxxd1823xxx  treatment as an independent factor for
survival (p ⫽ 0.047). complications of myelosuppression
were the most significant side effects in all groups. nonhematologic toxicity was not observed in patients treated with
 xxxd1823xxx , while it occurred in 20 and 17% of patients
treated with intensive chemotherapy or other single agents,
respectively. thus,  xxxd1823xxx  showed favorable results,
similar response rates, a better nonhematologic toxicity profile, and a trend for better survival compared to intensive
chemotherapy, particularly in older patients [101].

ongoing trials
a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial,
sponsored by  xxxd3342xxx  corporation (boulder, co), will

97

compare subcutaneous  xxxd253xxx  plus best supportive care
versus conventional regimens plus best supportive care in
patients with mds. eligible patients will be randomized in a
ratio 1:1 to either  xxxd253xxx  or a conventional care regimen.
this study will enrole patients with a diagnosis of refractory anemia with raeb or raeb-t, according to the
fab classification, with an ipss score of int-2 or higher.
 xxxd253xxx  will be given at 75 mg/m2/day sc for 7 days
every 28 days, while conventional regimens include the
following options: best supportive care only; low-dose  xxxd1790xxx  (20 mg/m2/day sc ⫻ 14 days every 28 to 42 days);
or standard chemotherapy (e.g.,  xxxd1816xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx , one induction cycle and potentially up to two consolidation cycles).
furthermore, a randomized phase iii study comparing
intravenous low-dose  xxxd1823xxx  versus supportive care in
elderly patients with primary mds (⬎10% blasts or highrisk cytogenetics), secondary mds or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml), who are not elegible for intensive
therapy, was planned in 2002 by the eortc-german mds
study group and was recently activated. high-risk mds
according to bone marrow blast count (⬎10%) or poor
cytogenetics are included.  xxxd1823xxx  is administered at a
dose of 15 mg/m2 infused over a 4-h period every 8 h (45
mg/m2/day), for 3 consecutive days. courses are repeated
every 6 weeks, provided that hematologic recovery has
taken place before patients start a new cycle of therapy or,
in case of low blood counts before treatment, that the hematologic parameters (wbc, platelets, and hb) at least
reached pretreatment values. the study enrolls patients aged
60 or older, either untreated or pre-treated with growth
factors only, immunosuppresive agent, or hydroxyurea,
which had been stopped more than 6 weeeks before randomization. the primary end-point is survival from randomization and cross-over is not allowed.

studies combining demethylating agents with other
drugs
 xxxd1823xxx  has been also employed in the past in combination with other anticancer agents, such as anthracyclines. the initial phase ii studies were performed in patients with relapsed and resistant leukemia, in combination
with either  xxxd168xxx  (120 mg/twice daily for 3– 6 days) or
 xxxd2320xxx  (12 mg/m2 for 3 days) [102] and  xxxd1816xxx 
[103]. the high dose employed in these studies exclude that
the observed effects could be attributed to the demethylating
effect only [reviewed in 86].
 xxxd1823xxx  has been recently employed in patients with
advanced mds in combination with  xxxd2918xxx 
[104,105].  xxxd3218xxx  (pb) is an aromatic fatty
acid with cytostatic and differentiating activity on malignant
myeloid cells (id50, 1–2 mm) [106,107]. a number of
mechanisms have been proposed for the antitumor effect of
pb, including glutamine depletion [108] and inhibition of

98

g. leone et al. / clinical immunology 109 (2003) 89 –102

cholesterol synthesis [109]. the clinical activity of pb at
low concentrations (0.25– 0.5 mm) may be explained by its
effect on histone acetylation. at these doses, like butyric
acid, pb has an inhibitory activity on histone deacetylase,
inducing histone h3 and h4 acetylation [110]. like other
hdac inhibitors [111,112], pb in vitro induces synergistically with retinoids the differentiation and cell-cycle arrest
of myeloid leukemic cells. recent demonstrations of the
important role of histone acetylation in the regulation of
gene-expression and the recruitment of histone deacetylase
enzymes by several fusion genes involved in acute leukemias have led to the speculation that agents that inhibit
histone deacetylase may be useful in the treatment of hematological malignancies [113]. pb, like other hdac inhibitors, synergizes with demethylating agents [68,114 –
115]. patients with myelodysplasia (n ⫽ 11) and acute
myeloid leukemia (n ⫽ 16) were treated with pb as a 7-day
continuous infusion, repeated every 28 days, in a phase i
dose-escalation study [116]. the maximum tolerated dose
was 375 mg/kg/day, while higher doses led to dose-limiting
reversible neurocortical toxicity. at the maximum tolerated
dose, pb was extremely well tolerated, with no significant
toxicities. the median steady-state plasma concentration at
this dose was 0.29 – 0.16 mm. although no patients
achieved complete or partial remission, four patients
achieved hematological improvement (neutrophil increase
in three patients, platelet transfusion-independence in one
patient). other patients developed transient increases in
neutrophils or platelets and decrements in circulating blasts.
monitoring the percentage of clonal cells over the course of
pb administration, using centromere fluorescence in situ
hybridization, showed that hematopoiesis remained clonal.
hematological response was often associated to increases in
both colony-forming units– granulocyte macrophage and
leukemic colony-forming units. administration of pb at
higher doses was not feasible because of dose-limiting central nervous system toxicity, apparently due to accumulation
of the metabolite pa. signs of hematological activity were
seen in all patients with mds and aml receiving pb, at all
doses administered.
the outstanding toxicity profile of pb and the synergistic
effect of histone deacetylation and demethylating agents in
reactivating silenced genes [68] encouraged clinical studies
on the combination of pb and demethylating agents in
hematological diseases characterized by p15 silencing. two
national cancer clinical institute-sponsored studies, on
5- xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ) combined with pb have been
presented at the ash 2001 meeting. in the study of the
memorial sloan kettering cancer center [104], the treatment scheme entailed subcutaneous injections of  xxxd253xxx  for 7 consecutive days (75 mg/m2/day), similar to the
calgb schedule, followed by 5 days of iv pb (200 mg/
kg/day), repeated on a 21- to 28-day schedule, contingent on
tolerability and response. at that time, six patients with
mds/secondary aml had received at least one cycle of
therapy (range, 1–3). reduction in bone marrow blast

counts as well as increased myeloid maturation was observed in four patients, one pt with leukemia, relapsed
following bone marrow transplantation (bmt), had a complete elimination of bone marrow blasts after one cycle of
therapy, and subsequently underwent a second allogeneic
bmt. peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were
collected before  xxxd253xxx , on day 8 (at completion of
 xxxd253xxx  and before beginning pb) and at the completion
of pb. an increase in histone acetylation was consistently
detected in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples
collected after pb administration. selected genes commonly
silenced (e.g.,  xxxg422xxx  in myelogenous leukemia) were
analyzed for methylation and expression. changes in methylation of the  xxxg422xxx  ( xxxg422xxx ) promoter were assessed using real-time pcr.
treatment was relatively well tolerated, with mild adverse reactions including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and
local tenderness at injection sites, associated with  xxxd253xxx , and
transient somnolence and drowsiness, associated with pb.
this ongoing study will evaluate the safety and potential
antitumor efficacy of this combination and its effects on
gene methylation and histone deacetylation.
a second study combining  xxxd253xxx  and pb was reported by the johns hopkins’ baltimore group [105]. sequential administration of  xxxd253xxx  and pb to reexpress
transcriptionally silenced genes was initated in patients with
mds and aml. the initial  xxxd253xxx  dose was also 75
mg/m2/day sc, in this study given for 5 days, followed by
pb at 375 mg/kg/day iv, continuous infusion, days 5–12
repeated every 28 days. dose deescalation to determine the
minimal  xxxd253xxx  dose associated with significant demethylation continues (current dose level 50 mg/m2/day).
eleven patients have been treated in a total of 39 courses.
the combination was well tolerated with 1/6 patients at the
highest dose level developing dose limiting toxicity (fatigue). no unexpected clinical toxicities have been observed
to date. two patients had significant hematopoietic improvement. the primary laboratory end point is inhibition
of methylation. baseline methylation activity was highly
variable. of 2 patients with high baseline activity, one had
significant inhibition (85% of baseline levels) following
treatment with  xxxd253xxx  (50 mg/m2/day). two of 5 patients
with lower baseline levels of activity also showed inhibition
(20 and 30%) following treatment with 75 mg/m2/day. histone acetylation was increased over baseline in 4 of 11
patients investigated. in addition, 2 patients had significant
detectable acetylation that persisted during the pb infusion.
increases in acetylation were detected within 4 h of initiation of pb infusion and persisted throughout the infusion. in
9 patients, sequential measurements of  xxxg422xxx  promoter
methylation by a newly developed pcr-based assay were
performed. all had measurable methylation of the p15 promoter exceeding 10% of available cpg sites (normal ⬍
2%). p15 methylation density was higher in patients with

g. leone et al. / clinical immunology 109 (2003) 89 –102

aml or raeb-t compared to patients with lower-grade
mds. in 3 patients during  xxxd253xxx /pb treatment, p15 methylation levels decreased to 19, 45, and 56%, respectively.
p15 methylation increased in 1 patient (in association with
disease progression) and was stable in 5 patients. baseline
methylation density did not predict for the extent of demethylation in response to 5ac/pb.
both studies demonstrate that the sequential administration of a “first generation” demethylating agent and hdac
inhibitors is feasible and give preliminary evidence of an
effect on the methylated targeted gene promoter, as also
described with  xxxd1823xxx  [65].
in lymphoproliferative diseases, clinical experiences
with demethylating drug with or without hdac inhibitors
have not been reported, yet, an encouraging study with
 xxxd1841xxx , an hdac inhibitor, has been recently reported [117]. in a phase i trial of  xxxd1841xxx , conducted at
the national cancer institute, three patients with cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma had a partial response, and one patient
with peripheral t-cell lymphoma had a complete response.
sezary cells isolated from patients after treatment had increased histone acetylation. these results suggest that inhibition of hdac is a novel and potentially effective therapy
for patients with t-cell lymphoma and that combination
therapy with demethylating agents may improve these results.

conclusions
transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes occurs in cancer cell by dna methylation and by hdac.
hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes has been
found in many hematological malignancies both lymphoid
and myeloid. yet, at present, the demethylating agents  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  have been tested in clinical trials of
patients with mds, acute myeloid leukemia, or cml blast
phase, only. the favorable results, together with the limited
toxicity, indicate demethylating agents as the most promising drugs for the treatment of elderly patients with high-risk
mds in whom intensive treatment is not feasible, and possibly for younger patients with these disorders, without a
compatible marrow donor. combination therapy, adding
histone deacetylation inhibitors, such as  xxxd3218xxx , could further increase the efficay of these drugs.
