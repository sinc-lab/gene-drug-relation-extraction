introduction

intraocular pressure (iop) reflects the balance between aqueous humour production
and drainage. production depends upon a combination of filtration and osmotic
pressures, together with active ion transport, based upon a na/k-atpase. drainage
occurs mostly via trabecular meshwork into the canal of schlemm. another portion
of aqueous humour leaves the eye throughout the longitudinal fibres of the ciliary
muscle into the supraciliary – suprachoroidal space and the sclera. this uveoscleral
outflow has been calculated either directly or indirectly, providing considerably
higher uveoscleral outflow rates than the 4 – 14% recorded by bill and phillips more
than 30 years ago [1]. in fact, these more recent studies reported values for uveoscleral
flow ranging between 12% and 54% of total aqueous outflow [2,3], although an
age-dependent reduction has been described [3,4].
in this second part of the review, the following classes of pharmacotherapeutic
agents will be considered: compounds acting on the aqueous humour production
(systemic and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; cais) and compounds able to
improve aqueous humour uveoscleral outflow (prostaglandin analogues and prostamides), focusing the discussion exclusively on those available for the medical
treatment of glaucoma – mainly the primary open-angle glaucoma (poag)
form – and on the clinical evidence supporting their use.
acetazolamide, the original cai, although introduced as long ago as 1954 and
available for oral use only, is still in use. the development of topical cais has modified
the safety profile of this drug class. prostaglandin analogues and prostamides, which
represent the class of drugs newly introduced into the armamentarium of glaucoma

carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

carbonic anhydrase (ca) is a zinc-containing enzyme which
catalyses the hydration of carbon dioxide. the addition of
h2o to co2 results in the formation of bicarbonate (hco3).
the cais are a class of drugs that suppress the activity of this
enzyme, or of its isoforms, and catalyse the rapid conversion
of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. in humans,
14 different ca isozymes or ca-related proteins have been
described, with very different subcellular localization and
tissue distribution. the principle indication is in the treatment of glaucoma, although research is being conducted into
numerous other fields including microbiology, oncology and
the management of obesity. the inhibition of ca isoenzyme
ii in the ciliary body decreases bicarbonate secretion into the
posterior chamber by ciliary epithelial cells. this induces a
decrease in the production of aqueous humour [5].
systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
the first compound exerting this effect has been acetazolamide (diamox) [6]. it has been found to lower the tension in
a high percentage of normal as well as glaucomatous eyes.
when introduced in to clinical practice, acetazolamide represented a major advance when treatment of glaucoma predominantly relied on the topical application of direct and indirect
parasympathomimetics, such as pilocarpine and cholinesterase
inhibitors. the maximum recommended dose for this purpose is 250 mg every 4 h. diabetes and kidney disease are
absolute contraindications. the drug is more effective intravenously than orally, and this route is particularly useful in
treating patients under acute attack of glaucoma who, because
of nausea and vomiting, are unable to retain the compound.
complications include numbness and tingling of the extremities, headache, dizziness, nausea and insomnia. some of these
may be concurrent, but all disappeared promptly when the
drug was discontinued or the dosage reduced. despite these
adverse effects, acetazolamide seems to maintain a unique role
when it is necessary to obtain a rapid decline of high iop, in
pseudoexfoliation syndrome, in the crisis of acute glaucoma,
before surgery, or in addition to other treatments. it also seems
to be helpful in getting patients past relatively short-lived
attacks secondary to trauma or inflammation [7].
2.1

topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
systemically administered cais are very effective ocular
hypotensive agents. however, the extraocular inhibition of
2.2

2860

the enzyme results in myriad side effects, as reported in
the previous section. as a consequence of this, approximately
50% of patients are unable to continue therapy. an obvious
approach to decrease systemic side effects was to develop a
formulation for topical administration. however, both the
topical and the subconjunctival injection of acetazolamide
failed to lower the iop of rabbits [8]. this is due to the
fact that ca must be essentially inhibited by 100% to lower
iop. the topical administration of drugs such as acetazolamide did not achieve this degree of inhibition. about
40 years after the introduction of acetazolamide, the first
topical cai has become available.  xxxd1931xxx  possesses the
requisite properties to achieve the required inhibition of ca
following topical dosing. in 1998, a second topical cai,
 xxxd367xxx , became available. the chemical structures of
 xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx  are shown in figure 1.
 xxxd1931xxx 
 xxxd1931xxx  was the first topical cai. it is a potent inhibitor
of human ca isoenzyme ii in vitro (with a ratio of affinity
for isoenzyme ii to that for isoenzyme i of approximately
3000:1) a pilot study in patients indicated that the optimal
dosing frequency is more than twice daily, at a concentration
of 2% [9]. when topically applied, a 20% iop reduction, both
in humans and in animal models, occurs. the mechanism
of action consists in the reduction of aqueous humour formation, like systemically administered acetazolamide, without
the systemic adverse events related to the intake of the
parent compound [10,11]. in the first published study, it was
administered three times daily. the peak decline in iop
was 27% reduction from baseline. since then, several studies
have confirmed this datum [9-12]. partial therapeutic additivity would be expected when this class of drugs is used
in conjunction with other topical hypotensive compounds.
 xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx , in unfixed or fixed combination
have an additive effect on lowering iop when administered
together.  xxxd1931xxx / xxxd3377xxx  is a well-tolerated and effective
fixed combination in the treatment of poag patients and is
likely to be useful in those patients who do not respond adequately to first-line monotherapy. compared with concomitant
therapy with the same two drugs, the primary advantage is
the improvement in patient compliance [12]. o’connor et al.,
in a study on the additive iop-lowering effect of various
medications with  xxxd2446xxx , found that  xxxd1931xxx  lowered iop more than either b-blockers or brimonidine [13].
recently, costagliola et al. have investigated the effect of
 xxxd1931xxx  on peripapillary retinal haemodynamics in juvenile poag patients treated with  xxxd3377xxx . adjunctive therapy
with  xxxd1931xxx  induced a further reduction of iop, with a
concomitant improvement of both ocular perfusion pressure
(opp) and retinal blood flow [14]. although both compounds
are suppressors of aqueous humour flow,  xxxd1931xxx  has
additive effects on the  xxxd3377xxx  iop lowering action [12].
the most common ocular symptoms were stinging,
burning, blurred vision, itching and tearing [10]. conjunctivitis

and eyelid inflammation have been reported as adverse experiences, resolved upon discontinuation of drug therapy. superficial punctate keratitis episodes have been also documented.
the most common systemic side effect was a transient bitter
taste, which was reported by approximately 25% of treated
patients [10]. however, less than 0.1% of patients discontinued
therapy for this reason. other systemic events infrequently
recorded have been headache, nausea, fatigue, paresthesia,
urolithiasis and skin rashes [9-12].
 xxxd367xxx 
 xxxd367xxx  inhibits  xxxg293xxx , the predominant isoenzyme
within the eye [15]. the iop-lowering effect is due to a
suppression of aqueous humour secretion due to the inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  in the ciliary processes. in fact, twice-daily
application of  xxxd367xxx  had equivalent efficacy to threetimes-daily  xxxd1931xxx  and less efficacy than  xxxd3377xxx . after
3 months, treated patients showed a reduction in iop of
19.1% when  xxxd367xxx  was administered twice daily and
20.3% when the dosage increased to three times daily [16].
a comparative study on the iop-lowering efficacy and side
effects of 2%  xxxd1931xxx  and 1%  xxxd367xxx  demonstrated that  xxxd367xxx  is at least as efficacious as  xxxd1931xxx  as a suppressor of aqueous humour flow in normal
human eyes and that there is probably no clinically significant
difference between the two drugs in this efficacy [17,18]. clinicians who prescribe  xxxd367xxx  should expect similar ocular
hypotensive responses from  xxxd367xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx ,
with a different side-effect profile,  xxxd367xxx  being significantly more comfortable than  xxxd1931xxx  when topically
applied [17,18].
in recent clinical trials, the  xxxd367xxx / xxxd3377xxx  suspension provides statistically significant and clinically relevant
iop-lowering efficacy that is non-inferior to that achieved
by  xxxd1931xxx / xxxd3377xxx . additionally,  xxxd367xxx / xxxd3377xxx 
affords an ocular comfort advantage compared with  xxxd1931xxx / xxxd3377xxx , making this association well tolerated and,
generally, associated with significantly lower ocular discomfort
scores than  xxxd1931xxx / xxxd3377xxx  [19,20].  xxxd367xxx / xxxd3377xxx 
has shown to reduce iop further in adjunctive therapy. no
significant change was found in corneal thickness and corneal
endothelium cell density after treatment [18]. because of its
selectivity, adverse events tend to be mild and non-serious.
2.2.2

stinging and burning are the most frequently recorded,
whereas foreign body sensation, itching, tearing and dry
eyes were reported to a lesser extent [15,16]. both  xxxd367xxx 
and its major metabolite are excreted primarily by the kidneys.
the most common non-ocular adverse event was taste perversion. no clinically significant differences from baseline in
heart rate (hr) and blood pressure (bp), and laboratory values
for haematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis variables were
observed after  xxxd367xxx  application.
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are related to the sulphonamide group of drugs that are known to be sensitizers, and
ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported also when
they are topically applied [18]. the use of cais is limited by
side effects ranging from general malaise to symptomatic
metabolic acidosis, renal calculi, transaminitis, bone marrow
suppression and dermatologic reactions ranging from simple
hypersensitivity to stevens – johnson syndrome. orally
administered cais may accentuate the effects of diuretics
and contribute to volume depletion and clinically significant
hypokalaemia. concomitant use with aspirin increases the risk
of salicylate toxicity. idiosyncratic aplastic anaemia has been
associated with the use of sulphonamides. a retrospective
swedish study revealed 11 cases of acetazolamide-associated
aplastic anaemia during a 17-year period. given the rate of
acetazolamide use during that period, the reported incidence
was one in 17,800 patient-years, and the calculated relative
risk was 13.3. other haematological side effects have included
rare reports of myelosuppression. thrombocytopaenia, leukopaenia, and even pancytopaenia and aplastic anaemia have
been reported [21]. like acetazolamide,  xxxd1931xxx  and
 xxxd367xxx  are sulphonamide derivatives. as such, the
potential exists for all the abovementioned systemic side
effects. so far, however, the topical agents have not been
associated with these systemic adverse events.  xxxd1931xxx 
and  xxxd367xxx  should not be prescribed to patients with a
history of hypersensitivity to sulpha medications, and their use
is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal
impairment. it may be assumed that the topical compounds
are favoured over oral agents because of their greater site
specificity and markedly fewer systemic side effects [8,9,19].
topical cais have proven both to increase ocular blood
flow (obf) and to improve the regulation of obf, thereby
decreasing the chance of reperfusion injury [14]. improvement

of blood flow, however, is not similar in all vessels. haemodynamic changes in the ophthalmic artery are similar in
normal and glaucomatous eyes. in this vessel the peak systolic
velocity (psv) seems not to be affected, whereas the end
diastolic velocity and the resistance index result improved. on
the contrary,  xxxd1931xxx  induces different haemodynamic
changes in the central retina artery (cra) of normal and
glaucomatous eyes. in this vessel, the psv increases in glaucomatous eyes but not in normal eyes. the effect of the drug
on the remaining haemodynamic parameters of the cra and
central retina vein (crv) is similar in normal and glaucomatous eyes. this differential effect of  xxxd1931xxx  on the
cra of normal and glaucomatous eyes may be explained by
the more prominent effect of the drug in lowering the iop in
the second group of eyes [22]. parallel to an improvement in
obf, an improvement in visual field has been observed, both
in glaucoma patients [23] and in patients suffering from agerelated maculopathy, suggesting a new role for these
compounds [24].
3. prostanoids: prostaglandins analogues and
prostamides

prostanoids are the newest pharmacologic group, which has
revolutionized the medical treatment of glaucoma; in fact, in
contrast to b-blockers, their main mechanism of action consists in an increase of the uveoscleral outflow. aqueous
humour leaves the eye by two routes: mainly, through the
trabecular meshwork and schlemm’s canal (conventional
outflow) and, secondly, through the anterior uvea (unconventional outflow), which, under normal circumstances,
accounts for about 50% of the total outflow [25]. flow through
the uveoscleral outflow is often referred to as pressureindependent because uveoscleral flow does not depend on
the iop to the same extent as trabecular outflow. within the
normal range of iop flow through the trabecular meshwork
increases almost linearly, while uveoscleral flow is relatively
pressure-independent. thus, as iop is raised there is a concomitant increase in pressure across the main resistance of the
trabecular outflow route. the pressure gradients for the uveoscleral flow are quite different. the fact that the sclera offers
little resistance to flow, and that the choroidal vessels probably
can easily absorb the small amount of aqueous delivered, makes
it likely that the main resistance is within the ciliary muscle;
in fact, the uveoscleral outflow is decreased by contraction
(pilocarpine) and increased by relaxation (atropine) of the
ciliary muscle [25]. thus, changing the tone of the ciliary muscle
may redistribute aqueous humour between the conventional
and uveoscleral outflow routes. the ocular hypotensive effect of
this class of drugs is accomplished by a several-fold enhancement of uveoscleral outflow, with little or no effect on aqueous
humour formation or episcleral venous pressure, and either no
effect or a modest increase in trabecular outflow [26].
these chemical compounds, structurally derived from
naturally occurring prostaglandin f(2), have been divided
2862

into prostaglandin analogues (pgas,  xxxd2446xxx  and
 xxxd3414xxx ) and prostamides ( xxxd340xxx ) (figure 2).
although their exact mechanism of action is still not clear,
these compounds act through a binding to the prostanoid
fp receptors of the ciliary body, upregulating production of
various metalloproteinases (mmps), zinc-dependent endoproteinases involved in the remodelling of the extracellular
matrix, which initiate the degradation of the extracellular
matrix and play a major role in regulating resistance to
flow through tissues [27-29]. tissues in which increased
mmp expression occurs typically have increased turnover
and remodelling of extracellular matrix (ecm). mmps are
expressed by human trabecular meshwork and directly control outflow resistance in human organ-cultured anterior
segments. increased mmps have been recorded in human
ciliary muscle cells exposed to  xxxd2446xxx  and, in vivo, an
alteration of ciliary muscle ecm does occur [30,31]. the
increased expression of mmps seems to be a consequence of
an increased expression of c-fos in ciliary muscle cells [32].
the early effect of prostaglandins on uveoscleral flow and iop
may be mediated by a relaxation of the ciliary muscle. it has
also been suggested that vasodilatation could be responsible
for the early effect on uveoscleral outflow by prostaglandins,
which are potent vasodilators. however, vasodilation in itself
seems to have little effect on uveoscleral flow [25,31]. the
long-term effect on iop is likely to be mediated by remodelling of the ciliary muscle with increased space for outflow.
lütjen-drecoll and tamm [33] found enlarged spaces between
the ciliary muscle bundles in monkeys after treatment with
 xxxd1902xxx  for 4 – 8 days. the enlarged extracellular spaces are
due to a disturbed balance in the turnover of collagen. topical
application of  xxxd1902xxx  reduces the amount of collagen in the
ciliary muscle of monkeys [34]. the changes in the ciliary
muscle are mediated by fp receptors. there is likely to be an
initial effect induced by ciliary muscle relaxation, but it is
unlikely to be potent as the effect on iop is slow. in support of
a rearrangement of the ciliary muscle as the main factor, it was
found that withdrawing  xxxd2446xxx  after 12 months treatment caused a very slow recovery of the iop with a small but
significant effect remaining after 2 weeks.  xxxd1902xxx  or  xxxd2446xxx  acid treatment of human ciliary muscle cultures reduces
collagen types i, iii and iv; and laminin as well showed
reductions of fibronectin and hyaluronans. these results
indicate that prostaglandin treatments that activate the fp
receptor and induce mmps may lead to alterations of
numerous ecm components within the ciliary muscle [25,31].
topical treatments with fp-receptor agonists that lower
iop by increasing uveoscleral outflow activate a molecular
transduction cascade. this cascade includes induction of the
nuclear transcription factors c-fos, and an increase in the
biosynthesis of mmps, which lead to a reduction of ecm
components within the ciliary muscle, iris root and sclera [32].
uveoscleral outflow is known to flow from the anterior chamber into the extracellular spaces of the ciliary muscle and then
pass mostly through the sclera. additional mechanisms that

prostanoid receptor subtypes in human ocular tissues demonstrate that the highest expression of the  xxxg1872xxx 
protein was found in the epithelia of the cornea, conjunctiva,
lens and the ciliary body; trabecular cells; iris vessels; and
retinal ganglion cells.  xxxg1873xxx  labelling was most prominent in the corneal epithelium and choriocapillaries. ep3
and  xxxg1875xxx  labelling was primarily observed in the
corneal endothelium and keratocytes, trabecular cells, ciliary
epithelium, and conjunctival and iridal stroma cells, and ep3
was found, in addition, in retinal müller cells. the highest
expression of  xxxg1878xxx  protein was found in the corneal
epithelium, ciliary epithelium, the circular portion of ciliary
muscle, and iris stromal and smooth muscle cells. immunoelectron microscopy showed a subcellular distribution of all
prostanoid receptors along plasma membranes and the nuclear
envelope. ep and  xxxg1878xxx  mrna expression largely
paralleled the proteins’ expression patterns. these findings
demonstrate a wide distribution but differential expression of
fp and ep prostanoid receptor subtypes in human ocular
tissues [36].  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  are  xxxg1878xxx  agonists which lower intraocular pressure
by enhancing the uveoscleral outflow.

 xxxd2446xxx 
 xxxd2446xxx  is a prostaglandin f2a analogue. iop reduction
starts approximately 3 – 4 h after administration and the
peak is reached 8 – 12 h later. it is absorbed throughout the
cornea, where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolysed to
the acid form to become biologically active. studies in humans
indicate that the peak concentration in the aqueous humour is
reached about 2 h after topical administration. the active acid
of  xxxd2446xxx  reaching the systemic circulation is primarily
metabolized by the liver. the elimination of the acid of
 xxxd2446xxx  from human plasma is rapid after both intravenous and topical administration. systemic clearance is approximately 7 ml/min/kg. following hepatic b-oxidation, the
metabolites are mainly eliminated by kidneys. approximately
88% and 98% of the administered dose is recovered in the
urine after topical and intravenous dosing, respectively.  xxxd2446xxx  is rapidly and completely hydrolysed to the biologically active  xxxd2446xxx  acid in humans. the concentration in
the aqueous humour is approximately 1000 times higher than
in plasma after topical administration, and the drug is partly
absorbed into the systemic circulation. the plasma elimination half-life of  xxxd2446xxx  acid is short, the clearance high,
and the volume of distribution small. the metabolites are
mainly excreted into urine. the major metabolism of  xxxd2446xxx  comprised ester hydrolysis and b-oxidation [37]. clinical
studies performed using the evening, once-daily  xxxd2446xxx 
administration, have demonstrated that it reduces iop by
30 – 35% from baseline [38,39]. a 6-month randomized,
double-masked, multicentre study with three parallel groups
( xxxd3377xxx  b.i.d.,  xxxd2446xxx  in the morning and  xxxd2446xxx  in
the evening) has demonstrated that  xxxd3377xxx  reduced diurnal
iop from 24.6 to 17.9 mmhg (27%);  xxxd2446xxx  applied in

may contribute to the prostaglandin-mediated increase of
uveoscleral outflow include relaxation of the ciliary muscle,
cell shape changes, cytoskeletal alteration, and/or compaction
of the ecm within the tissues of the uveoscleral outflow
pathway [25,31]. all of these mechanisms alter the permeability
of tissues of the outflow pathways leading to changes in
outflow resistance and/or outflow rates.
the naturally occurring prostanoids, namely prostaglandins
d2, e2, f2a and i2 ( xxxg1073xxx , pge2,  xxxd1902xxx , and pgi2) and
thromboxane a2 (txa2), are autocrine or paracrine molecules
with an extraordinary wide spectrum of biological activity.
the receptors with particular sensitivity to  xxxg1073xxx , pge2,
 xxxd1902xxx , pgi2 and txa2 are designated dp ep, fp, ip, and
te respectively. these receptors are distributed in various
tissues in the eye and in the rest of the body. receptor binding
as well as pharmacologic and molecular biologic studies have
suggested the presence of the  xxxg1878xxx  in various tissues of
the reproductive, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, digestive, respiratory, endocrine and nervous systems [[35]. the
molecular structure of all prostanoid receptors is typical of
that for g-protein-coupled receptors and consists of seven

the morning, from 25.5 to 17.7 mmhg (31%); and  xxxd2446xxx  applied in the evening, from 24.8 to 16.2 mmhg (35%).
the efficacy of  xxxd2446xxx  applied in the evening is statistically superior to  xxxd2446xxx  applied in the morning and to
 xxxd3377xxx  (p < 0.001) [38]. the exact peak effect of  xxxd2446xxx 
on lowering iop is unknown; probably it occurs 8 or more
hours after administration, whereas the trough is at the
24th hour [40]. both evening and morning dosages of  xxxd2446xxx  have their best intraocular pressure effect 12 – 24 h after
administration. these data may indicate that  xxxd2446xxx 
provides a peak efficacy in the second 12-h period after
administration. evening dosing of  xxxd2446xxx  reduces the
range of diurnal curve compared with morning administration
and may be an advantage of nightly administration of this
compound. consequently, physicians may need to judge
when they give  xxxd2446xxx  by the extent and timing of
each individual patient’s own peak iop, by determining
circadian iop curves [41].
data from the literature indicate that once-daily application of  xxxd2446xxx  at the concentration of 0.005% is sufficient to lower iop at statistically and clinically significant
levels. this conclusion has been substantiated in three large
phase iii clinical studies [38]. some clinical trials have been
extended up to 5 years, demonstrating that the compound is
safe for long-term treatment, and that the iop-educing effect
is stable even in long-term follow-up, with no sign of upward
drift [37,41,42], although costagliola et al. [42] have recently
demonstrated a very slight decrease in its efficacy after
18 months of treatment, without significant differences in
iop among time points. all these studies have documented
the presence of non-responders, in a percentage ranging from
5 to 16% [42-44]. moreover, once-daily  xxxd2446xxx  provided
significantly better 24-h iop control than  xxxd3377xxx  [38].
the side-effect profile includes more frequently conjunctival hyperemia, eyelash changes, induced iris darkening, and
periocular skin pigmentation. less common, but potentially
more serious side effects include iris cysts, cystoid macular
oedema, anterior uveitis and reactivation of herpes simplex
keratitis. iris cysts represent a rare event that has been associated with pga therapy, firstly by krohn and hove [45] in a
case report and, then, by additional reports suggesting  xxxd2446xxx  as the possible cause of pigmented epithelial cyst
formation [46]. in each case, there was decrease in the size of
the cyst after stopping  xxxd2446xxx  medication with complete
reversal in a matter of months. the mechanism of cysts
development might be related to flow pressures caused by
increased uveoscleral drainage. inflammation and cell proliferation have also been reported as possible causes of acquired
iris cyst formation; moreover, the relatively rapid reversal on
drop withdrawal, as well as the lack of any recurrences makes
the involvement of proliferative events in the occurrence of
cyst formation in these cases unlikely [46]. the pathophysiological mechanism of cystoid macular edema (cme) associated
with pga therapy seems to involve both a breakdown of the
blood – aqueous barrier and a disruption of the posterior lens
2864

capsule that allows the inflammatory mediators to reach the
macula. the risk of cme is extremely low in patients with no
history of previous intraocular surgery or uveitis and relatively
low even in high-risk eyes [46]. furthermore, the cme is
reversible with early discontinuation of the pga, and it has
even been shown that the cme can be prevented with an
nsaid, such as diclofenac [42]. based on these clinical findings, it has been recommended that, while a pga may not be
the first drug of choice in patients that are at high risk for
cme (aphakia, pseudophakia with a ruptured posterior capsule during surgery, history of uveitis, or retinal inflammatory
or vascular disease), its incidence is low even in these patients
and it is not felt to constitute an absolute contraindication to
pga therapy [47]. few case reports of anterior uveitis associated with  xxxd2446xxx  therapy have been reported [46]. none of
these patients had a history of iritis or any medical condition
associated with uveitis. the anterior uveitis resolved in all
patients with discontinuation of  xxxd2446xxx , with or without
steroid therapy. the mechanism by which pgas induce this
adverse event may be due to an unusual sensitivity to pgas,
with increased release of  xxxd208xxx  and enhanced
production of proinflammatory eicosanoids [46]. in 1999,
wand and associates reported three patients in which herpes
simplex keratitis (hsk) developed or reactivated after initiation of  xxxd2446xxx  therapy [48]. in an attempt to understand better the association between hsk and topical pga
therapy, data were extracted from the claims records of
93,869 glaucoma patients between 1996 and 2002, revealing
411 patients with an ocular herpes simplex virus event, which
is a similar rate to that found in the general population and
did not correlate with any particular anti-glaucoma therapy [49]. therefore, the risk of activating an ocular herpes
simplex infection through the initiation of pga therapy is
quite low. nevertheless, based on anecdotal case reports and
laboratory observations, it is prudent to enquire regarding a
history of hsk when starting a glaucoma patient on a new
ocular hypotensive medication and to consider alternatives to
pgas in those with a positive history [46]. conjunctival
hyperaemia, eyelash changes and cystoid macular oedema
are reversible, but certain other side effects, such as increased
iris pigmentation, are not. a recent open-label safety surveillance study conducted in 14 countries demonstrated that
 xxxd2446xxx  is a safe long-term treatment for patients with
glaucoma and ocular hypertension [43] and the systemic sideeffect profile is, in general, favourable for  xxxd2446xxx  as well as
for all the prostaglandin analogues, and some of the local side
effects are only of cosmetic significance.
 xxxd3414xxx 
 xxxd3414xxx  is a synthetic prostaglandin f2a analogue. iop
reduction starts approximately 2 h after administration and
with a peak 12 h later.  xxxd3414xxx , an isopropyl ester prodrug,
is hydrolysed by esterases in the cornea to its biologically active
free acid. systemically,  xxxd3414xxx  free acid is metabolized to
inactive metabolites via beta-oxidation of the a (carboxylic

acid) chain to give the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor analogues, via oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl moiety, as well as via
reduction of the 13,14 double bond. the elimination of
 xxxd3414xxx  free acid from plasma is rapid and levels are
generally below the limit of quantification within 1 h after
dosing. the mean half-life elimination of  xxxd3414xxx  is estimated to be approximately 45 min. less than 2% of the
topical ocular dose of  xxxd3414xxx  is excreted in the urine within
4 h as  xxxd3414xxx  free acid.  xxxd3414xxx  is a very stable
compound, maintaining its efficacy following exposure to
extremely low and high temperatures, repeated freezing and
thawing and exposure to light [50]. a study comparing morning versus evening dosing and 24-h post-dose efficacy of
both  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  in poag patients has demonstrated that, when the compounds were administered in the
evening, mean iop decrease was similar in the two treatment
regimens. in the morning-dosing crossover comparison, the
24-h post-dose iop was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in
patients on  xxxd3414xxx  than in those receiving  xxxd2446xxx  [51].
 xxxd3414xxx  0.004% lowers iop more than  xxxd3377xxx  [52,53],
and similar to  xxxd2446xxx  [54]. subgroup analysis of a large
phase iii trial revealed  xxxd3414xxx  0.004% to be significantly
more effective at lowering iop in african-american patients
by almost 2 mmhg compared with non-african-americans.
moreover, a higher percentage of african-american patients
responded to  xxxd3414xxx  0.004% and reached lower target
pressures than with either  xxxd2446xxx  0.005% or  xxxd3377xxx 
0.5%, although this study does not control statistically for
imbalances in baseline iop levels [55].  xxxd3414xxx  is distinguished from other marketed prostaglandin analogues in that
it is a full agonist at the prostaglandin receptor. it is also highly
selective with little or no affinity for other prostanoid or nonprostanoid receptors in the eye, providing robust lowering of
iop with little diurnal fluctuation and results in low target
pressures in a large percentage of patients [53].  xxxd3414xxx 
0.004% has an effective adjunctive agent offering an additional 5 – 7 mmhg iop reduction in patients inadequately
controlled on  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% [56]. throughout all clinical trials,
 xxxd3414xxx  was found to be safe and well-tolerated with very
few (< 5%) discontinuations due to local side effects or
systemic adverse events [57]. ocular hyperaemia together
with eyelash changes are the most frequent adverse event in
patients treated with  xxxd3414xxx  0.004%. ocular stinging and
burning has been infrequently reported, and iris pigmentation
even more rarely. clinically significant conjunctival hyperemia
and eyelash changes are greater in  xxxd3414xxx - than in  xxxd2446xxx -treated patients. a meta-analysis of randomized clinical
trials to evaluate the development of conjunctival hyperaemia
after the use of  xxxd2446xxx  versus  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd340xxx ,
in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma have
revealed that the use of  xxxd2446xxx  is associated with a lower
incidence of conjunctival hyperaemia when compared with
 xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  in the treatment of patients with
ocular hypertension or glaucoma [58]. the incidence of iris
pigmentation is similar [53].  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  had a

small but significantly higher prevalence of pruritus compared
with  xxxd3377xxx  (8%  xxxd3414xxx , 6%  xxxd2446xxx , 2%  xxxd3377xxx ,
p < 0.05) [59]. recently, yang et al. have reported two cases
with a deepening of the eyelid superior sulcus associated with
 xxxd3414xxx  use. in both patients  xxxd3414xxx  was unilaterally
applied so that the disparity between the treated eye and the
fellow eye was quite visible. however, the disparity returned to
normal after discontinuation of  xxxd3414xxx . the proposed
mechanism is a mechanical insult to the eyelid causing levator
dehiscence, as well as a fatty degeneration and reduced collagen fibres in the levator complex caused by the  xxxd1902xxx 
analogue [60].
 xxxd340xxx 
 xxxd340xxx  is a  xxxd340xxx , a synthetic structural analogue of
prostaglandin with ocular hypotensive activity. it selectively
mimics the effects of naturally occurring substances, prostamides, which couples with sensitive receptors distinct from
those recognized for  xxxd1902xxx  and pge2-glyceryl ester [61].
although a variety of  xxxg1878xxx  antagonists have been
reported, so far none has stood up to rigorous analysis, and
 xxxd340xxx  receptors are yet to be cloned [62]. it is important
to emphasize that  xxxd340xxx  activity has never been reported
as a phenomenon completely independent of prostanoid fp
receptor stimulation; taken together, these results seem to
indicate that  xxxd340xxx  and fp receptors may be encoded by
the same gene [63].
iop reduction starts approximately 4 h after the first
administration with a peak approximately 8 – 12 h later.
pharmacokinetic studies have shown that after one drop of
 xxxd340xxx  0.03% administered to both eyes for 2 weeks,
blood concentrations peaked within 10 min after dosing and
were below the lower limit of detection (0.025 ng/ml) within
1.5 h after dosing.  xxxd340xxx  is moderately distributed into
body tissues and in human blood. once it reaches the systemic
circulation following ocular dosing, it undergoes oxidation,
n-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety
of metabolites. elimination half-life is of approximately
45 min. up to 67% of the administered dose is excreted in
the urine while 25% of the dose is recovered in the faeces [64].
in normotensive volunteers,  xxxd340xxx  reduces iop by
about 20% from baseline, whereas in patients with openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension this percentage rises up
to 32% [65]. results from diurnal analyses indicate that when
given once daily,  xxxd340xxx  is statistically more effective
than at the twice-daily dosage. in a comparison with  xxxd3377xxx 
0.5% twice daily,  xxxd340xxx  is more effective, although
adverse events such as hyperaemia and pruritus appeared more
often in the  xxxd340xxx  groups (once- and twice-daily) than
in the  xxxd3377xxx  groups [54]. with regard to the iop-lowering
effect,  xxxd340xxx  0.03% and  xxxd2446xxx  0.005% are equivalent, demonstrating the same degree of reduction, although
 xxxd340xxx  exhibits a more significant frequency and severity
of hyperaemia and eyelash growth compared with  xxxd3377xxx 
or  xxxd2446xxx  [65-68]. more recently, aptel et al. in a

meta-analysis evaluating the iop-lowering effects and tolerability of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx  and  xxxd3414xxx  found that
 xxxd340xxx  has a greater efficacy, together with a higher
incidence of hyperaemia compared with the other two compounds [57].  xxxd340xxx  0.03% has been also reported to
cause changes to pigmented tissues. the most frequently
reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the
iris, eyelid and eyelashes, and growth of eyelashes. pigmentation is expected to increase as long as the compound is
administered. after discontinuation, pigmentation of the iris
is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of eyelid and
eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some
patients. lastly, tappeiner et al. have recently reported the
occurrence of enophthalmos in a retrospective case series of
five glaucoma patients under long-term topical  xxxd340xxx 
treatment. the possible mechanism consists in an iatrogenic
orbital fat atrophy secondary to the induction of apoptosis of
orbital fibroblasts with a remodelling of the extracellular
matrix [69]. like the other compounds of this class,  xxxd340xxx  should be used with caution in patients with active
intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis). macular oedema,
including cystoid macular oedema, has been reported during
topical treatment with  xxxd340xxx . systemic adverse events
reported in descending order of incidence, include headaches,
abnormal liver function tests, asthenia and hirsutism [57,67].
in glaucoma and ocular hypertension, clinically relevant
intraocular pressure lowering due to a new medication is
frequently defined as at least a 15 or 20% reduction from
baseline iop. patients using  xxxd340xxx  are more likely than
those using  xxxd2446xxx  to achieve iop reductions of at least
15 or 20% from baseline throughout the day [68]. the prevalence of non-responders to  xxxd2446xxx  monotherapy in
human glaucomas is unknown. approximately 1% of subjects enrolled in clinical trials and treated with  xxxd2446xxx ,
0.005% monotherapy were withdrawn because of uncontrolled
iop; a > 20-fold higher prevalence of non-responders has
been reported when  xxxd2446xxx  was added to a pre-existing
antiglaucoma therapy [42,70]. gandolfi and cimino tested
the efficacy of  xxxd340xxx  in poag patients who did not
respond to treatment with  xxxd2446xxx ,and found that about
90% of patient non-responders to  xxxd2446xxx  were successfully treated with  xxxd340xxx  [71]. this effect is not surprising.
in fact,  xxxd2446xxx  is a prodrug; therefore, the lack of response
to  xxxd2446xxx  might also involve poor de-esterification of the
prodrug to the pharmacologically active free fatty acid [71].
 xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%),  xxxd340xxx  (0.03%) and  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%) have been shown to be as or more effective
in lowering iop than  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%. although there is extensive documentation concerning the efficacy of the three
prostaglandin analogues, the majority of the studies that
compared their efficacy and safety have shown no clinically
significant differences in the iop-lowering ability of these
medications at 08.00 h, the time of peak effect, and differences
at other time points may have been confounded by baseline
differences. parrish et al., in a randomized controlled clinical
2866

trial, found that  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx  and  xxxd3414xxx 
were comparable in their ability to reduce iop in open-angle
glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients [72].  xxxd2446xxx 
exhibited greater ocular tolerability; in fact, significantly fewer
patients reported symptoms of ocular hyperaemia. compared
with  xxxd2446xxx , both  xxxd340xxx  and  xxxd3414xxx  have been
shown to have substantially higher rates of ocular side effects [58].
the small differences in iop reduction reported in individual
studies often is due to subgroup or post hoc analysis of data
in such a way as to favour the product manufactured by the
sponsor of the study and are not clinically relevant [55].

from 1867, when bayer first synthesized acetylcholine, slowly
moving from pilocarpine (1877) [73], adrenaline (1926) [74],
carbachol (1932) [75], diamox (1954) [76] and aceclidine
(1960) [77], early surgery would have been the safer choice
to ensure good iop control and to preserve the optic nerve
function (figure 3). in 1970, when the adrenergic antagonist
began to enter in to clinical practice, an approach of cautious
expectation, encouraged by the increased reliability of glaucoma diagnostic and follow-up tools, spread among ophthalmologists; during these decades laser trabeculoplasty was also
commonly performed, and the protocol usually followed
consisted of laser therapy as initial approach – given the
systemic adverse effects associated with b-blockers – and
then topically applied sympatholytic agents. topical cais
have become an important addition to the glaucoma armamentarium. they are more useful than their oral counterparts,
since they cause fewer systemic side effects, with similar
efficacy. brimonidine, a topical a2-adrenergic agonist, and
 xxxd2446xxx , a topical prostaglandin, have become important
additions to the glaucoma regimen because of their ability to
reduce iop, compared with older medications. from the
second half of the 1990s, pgas fully entered in to clinical
practice and clinicians had a wider range of choices, which
were generally associated with fewer adverse effects and
required less frequent administration. in figure 3, a schematic
summary of the medical compounds used over time in the
medical treatment of glaucoma is shown. today, medical
therapy can rightly be considered as the initial approach to
treatment. as recently pointed out by kenigsberg [78], a change
in the treatment of glaucoma has occurred with the introduction of these new compounds. in fact, the number of
ab externo trabeculectomies – and other glaucoma surgeries – in france between 1997 and 2003 significantly
declined. this reduction was strongly correlated with the
increase in the number of patients treated with pgas. it
remains to be seen whether patients benefit from this process
in the long-term or whether this is a false dawn of reliable and
effective long-term medical management of the condition in a
greater percentage of patients with glaucoma. prostaglandins
are potent topical antihypertensive medications that have
excellent iop control throughout the 24-h period [79]. in

general, therapy that improves aqueous outflow tends to
result in smaller iop fluctuations compared with therapy
that suppresses aqueous production [80]. although there
may be small differences in the efficacy and persistency of
circadian iop lowering between the commercially available
prostaglandins, they all demonstrate 24-h iop control that
seems to be superior to other classes of glaucoma medication [81]. thus, this class of compounds is the most suitable for
glaucoma patients.
however, glaucoma therapy should be dynamic, with changes
evolving as new patient symptoms occur or when new modalities to reduce iop are discovered. therefore, it is clear that the
introduction of new drugs for the management of glaucoma
will increase our chances of finding the best treatment for each
patient. to reach that goal, we will have to keep informed on
the pharmacology of these new classes of drugs. we must
become familiar with the clinical characteristics of each new
drug, their efficacy and side effects as well as the risks and
benefits of combining them with other drugs. we should aim
at the optimal drug or combination of drugs that effectively
reduces iop, while at the same time keeping in mind the effect
of our prescriptions on compliance and quality of life.
many factors are implicated in the choice of drugs for the
medical treatment of poag or ocular hypertension. this
choice involves the evaluation of medical reports, the interpretation of clinical studies and the analysis of the peculiar
characteristics of the patient who requires medical attention.
the sum of all these data concurs to guarantee the best care
for each well-identified patient. in fact, a correct doctrinaire
knowledge alone allows us to provide our patients with care

based on the best available evidence [82]. moreover, in an
era in which healthcare costs have acquired political significance in all industrialized countries, each single clinician,
with his prescription of both medications and all other
healthcare services, responsibly contributes to determining
the social cost for a disease. because of their effectiveness, and
the relative absence of local side effects and the problems
associated with topical therapy other than b-antagonists,
the latter are likely to remain the class of drug most often
chosen. generally a b-blocker is used initially with addition
or substitution of  xxxd2446xxx  if iop is not sufficiently
controlled. the advantage in switching from a b-blocker
to a pga may be the consequence of additional visual field
deterioration, which may occur despite a significant iop
reduction, because the iop obtained is not sufficient to
prevent further worsening; because the patient’s work or
his social activities do not allow a correct daily dosage of the
medication (bad compliance), and as a result of treatment
suspension, because of the development of systemic and/or
local side effects [83].
 xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  in fixed combination, together
with  xxxd2446xxx  offer triple medication with only three
drops a day. brimonidine and  xxxd1931xxx  are alternatives
for asthmatics. pga are increasingly being used as monotherapy having proved extremely popular with both clinicians
and patients because of its good iop-lowering effect and low
incidence of side effects. the place of  xxxd367xxx  remains
to be seen. finally, it is always wise to bear in mind that the
ultimate aim of therapy is to keep the patient with poag
asymptomatic in their lifetime and not necessarily to lower
