abstractðimunocytochemical techniques were used to determine whether agonist-induced activation of m-opioid receptors alters
the number and distribution of m-opioid receptor-positive cells in the rat cerebral cortex. in untreated rats, m-opioid receptor
immunoreactivity was localized to neuronal perikarya and dendrites and to neuropilar punctate structures. m-opioid receptorpositive neurons were mostly in layers ii and iii and exhibited a bipolar or bitufted morphology. in rats treated with the m-opioid
receptor agonist  xxxd2070xxx  (0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and perfused after different survival periods, there was an enhancement of
immunostaining for m-opioid receptors observed at 15 min, reaching a maximum at 60 min, and which returned to normal at
480 min.  xxxd2070xxx -induced effects included an increase in the intensity of cellular and neuropil staining; statistical analysis showed
that the number of m-opioid receptor-positive cells in  xxxd2070xxx -treated groups was signi®cantly higher than in controls or salinetreated rats. in animals that received both  xxxd2070xxx  and the m-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, the pattern of m-opioid receptors
immunoreactivity was similar to that of untreated animals.
this study shows that the number of m-opioid receptor-positive cells is signi®cantly increased following  xxxd2070xxx  treatment and
suggests that agonist treatment may be exploited to increased immunostaining of m-opioid receptors and also of other g-protein
coupled receptors. q 2000 ibro. published by elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

endogenous opioid peptides and opiates exert their biological
effects by interacting with three major classes of opioid
receptors, named d, k and m. these receptors are members
of the seven transmembrane  xxxg89xxx 
family, are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase via gi
proteins, 15 and have unique physiological and pharmacological properties. 2,9,15,20
m-opioid receptors (mors) have been implicated in many
physiological processes, including analgesia, sensory and
motor activity and the development of opiate addiction. 11,14,16
in vitro studies have shown that mors undergo internalization following exposure to selective agonists. 3,5,7,18,21 besides
its postulated role in regulating signal transduction and
surface receptor expression, agonist-induced mor internalization may mediate tolerance and dependence 17 and re¯ect
the differential biological actions of opioids. 22 agonistinduced redistribution mors has also been demonstrated in
vivo; 8 in this study, translocation of receptors following
agonist stimulation facilitated visualization of neurons
expressing the receptor, an event that could be exploited in
neuroanatomical studies to increase mor immunoreactivity
(mor ir). however, the possibility that agonist-induced
endocytosis results in changes in the number or distribution
of immunoreactive neurons has not been veri®ed.
the present study was therefore undertaken to determine

whether agonist-induced activation of mors modi®es the
number and distribution of mor ir cells in the brain of
adult rats.
experimental procedures

care and handling of animals were approved by the ethical committee for animal research (university of ancona) and the animal
research committee (vaglhs). four groups of rats (sprague±
dawley; 180±300 g) were used: (i) normal (n  8); (ii) saline-treated
(n  13); (iii)  xxxd2070xxx -treated (n  28); and (iv)  xxxd2070xxx - and
naloxone-treated (n  4). normal animals were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of pentobarbital (60 mg/100 g body
weight) or 30% chloral hydrate before perfusion. all animals were
deeply anesthetized 5 min before the end of the treatment period
with an i.p. injection of pentobarbital (60 mg/100 g body weight).
 xxxd2070xxx -treated animals that survived for 5 min were anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital 3 min before the end of the drug treatment
period. animals were perfused through the ascending aorta with 0.1 m
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
pbs. the brains were removed, post®xed for 1 h and stored at 48c in
20% sucrose in pbs. brains were cut in 20±25-mm-thick sections with
a vibratome or a sliding microtome; sections were collected in pbs
with 0.01% sodium azide and stored at 48c until processing.
rats received an i.p. injection of  xxxd2070xxx , a non-selective opioid
agonist (0.1 mg/kg in 0.5 ml of saline), and were killed at a 5 (n  2),
10 (n  2), 15 (n  2), 30 (n  4), 60 (n  4), 75 (n  2), 90 (n  2), 120
(n  2), 180- (n  2), 240 (n  2) or 480 (n  4) min survival period.
only rats that displayed catatonia within 2 min of  xxxd2070xxx  injection
were used. rats injected i.p. with saline (0.5 ml) survived for 10±
60 min after the injection. four rats received i.p. injections of  xxxd2070xxx 
and naloxone (10 mg/kg in 0.5 ml of saline), either simultaneously
(n  2) or sequentially (n  2), and were killed 30 min after  xxxd2070xxx 
injection.

results

speci®c mor immunostaining was observed in numerous
brain regions (fig. 1a), in agreement with previous studies. 1,4,6,13
no differences were noted in the immunostaining pattern of
the af®nity-puri®ed and the commercial antibodies.

m -opioid receptor immunoreactivity in the neocortex of
untreated rats
in the cerebral necortex, mor ir was localized to both
neuronal perikarya and dendrites and to few punctate structures in the neuropil (fig. 2a). most mor-positive neurons
were in layers ii±iii, although some were also observed in
other cortical layers, including layer vi; they exhibited a
bipolar or bitufted morphology and long, vertically oriented,
smooth dendrites (fig. 3a). cell bodies and proximal dendritic processes were characterized by very light cytoplasmic
staining with clumps of stronger immunoreactivity. mor ir
was not observed in tissue sections incubated in mor antibodies that had been preadsorbed with 10 25 m mor387±398
peptide (data not shown).

characterization of both antibodies has been reported. 12,21 additional
controls were performed, including substituting the primary antibodies
with pbs or normal serum and preadsorbing the af®nity-puri®ed antibody with 10 25 m mor387±398. the possibility that the antibodies crossreacted with the mor1b isoform 24 was not tested, but cross-reactivity
seems unlikely, since mor1b differs in its c-terminus from mor 24 and
is expressed only in the olfactory bulb. 19
sections from all animals were pretreated for 15±60 min with h2o2
[0.3% in phosphate buffer, (pb)], rinsed in pbs and incubated in the
primary antiserum (af®nity-puri®ed antiserum, dilution 1:100±1:200;
incstar antiserum, dilution 1:5000 to 1:15,000) with 0.3% triton x-100
and 10% normal serum (12±24 h, 48c). sections were subsequently
washed in pbs, incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit igg (vector
or jackson immuno research) for 1±2 h or overnight at 48c, washed in
pbs, then incubated in avidin±biotin peroxidase complex solution
(vector; 30 min±2 h). reaction product was demonstrated by 3 0 ,3diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloryde (40 mg/100 ml tris 0.05 m,
ph 7.6) with 0.02% h2o2. free-¯oating sections from series of treated
and control animals were processed in parallel to minimize possible
variations in immunostaining. sections were then rinsed in pbs,
mounted, air-dried, exposed to oso4 (0.05%; 10±20 s), dehydrated
and coverslipped.
data on the number of mor ir neurons were collected from the
parietal cortex ( xxxg746xxx   xxxg1598xxx ,  xxxg747xxx   xxxg1598xxx , fl and hl 23). all mor-positive neurons
present in 300-mm-wide randomly selected vertical strips of cortex
were counted. cells were counted regardless of whether a full-size
nucleus was evident, since the aim was to ascertain not the absolute
number of immunoreactive neurons but the changes induced by  xxxd2070xxx . for quantitative evaluation we selected: (i) saline-treated rats;
(ii)  xxxd2070xxx -treated animals with 30, 60 and 480 min survival periods;
and (iii)  xxxd2070xxx - and naloxone-treated animals. each group
consisted of four animals and all sections were processed in parallel
using the af®nity-puri®ed antibody. for each animal, 35 vertical strips
were selected and cells were counted using a 10 £ lens.
the effect of different treatments was veri®ed by one-way analysis
of variance (anova). multiple comparisons between the averages
were performed using the student±newman±keuls test (p  0.05).

m -opioid receptor immunoreactivity in the neocortex of
 xxxd2070xxx -treated rats
in rats injected i.p. with  xxxd2070xxx  (0.1 mg/kg in saline) and
perfused after different survival times (5±480 min) immunostaining in several brain regions appeared stronger than in
controls (fig. 1b). since changes were prominent in the
neocortex (fig. 1), the present analysis was focused to this
brain region.
in animals with short survival times (5±10 min) after i.p.
 xxxd2070xxx  injections, immunostaining of mor-positive
neurons was slightly increased compared with normal
animals. the immunostaining of cell bodies and processes
was much stronger in animals treated with  xxxd2070xxx  for
15 min; this effect was strongest in animals treated for
30 min (fig. 2b) and for 90 min with a peak of staining
intensity in animals which survived for 60 min (fig. 2c). in
animals treated with  xxxd2070xxx  for 30±60 min (fig. 3b, c),
mor-positive neurons were characterized by increased
immunoreactivity and by a granular appearance of immunoreactivity in the perikaryal cytoplasm and at the proximal
portion of dendrites. the distribution of immunoreaction
product in the somata and dendrites was similar to that
observed in untreated rats, except for the presence of more
prominent clumps in the somata and dendrites. at longer
survival times (120±240 min), immunostaining was not as
strong and at 480 min immunostaining it was similar to
that observed in normal and saline-treated animals (figs
2d, 3d). at all survival times, the changes induced by  xxxd2070xxx  treatment affected the staining intensity, but not the
distribution of mor-positive neurons. sections from animals
that received the agonist for 30 min and, most clearly, for
60 min also exhibited stronger neuropilar staining than
control animals.
in the animals that received saline for the same period as

cases (saline-treated animals; 30 min, 60 min and 480 min
 xxxd2070xxx -treated animals;  xxxd2070xxx - and naloxone-treated
animals) was counted in 300-mm-wide strips of cerebral
cortex (35 strips/animal; four animals/group). the sections
from these animals were processed together using the af®nitypuri®ed mor antibody to limit possible variations due to
histochemical processing. statistical analysis performed
using anova and multiple comparison tests showed that
the differences between the control and the treated groups
were highly signi®cant (p , 0.001; table 1), i.e. in animals
treated with  xxxd2070xxx  for 30 and 60 min, the number of morpositive neurons was higher than in control or saline-injected
animals. the number of mor-positive cells returned to baseline values at 480 min following treatment. statistical analysis did not reveal signi®cant differences between the number
of mor-positive neurons counted in  xxxd2070xxx - and naloxonetreated animals compared with control animals (table 1).
discussion

these results show that  xxxd2070xxx  induces a signi®cant
increase in the both the staining intensity and number of
immunoreactive cells, without changing the distribution and
cytological type of immunoreactive cells. the possibility that
these changes are related to procedural variables appears
highly unlikely since: (i) all animals belonged to the same
strain; (ii) the immunocytochemical procedure was rigorously
followed throughout all staining sessions; (iii) sections from
saline-,  xxxd2070xxx - and  xxxd2070xxx /naloxone-treated animals
were processed in parallel; and (iv) data on the number of
cells underwent stringent statistical analysis.
 xxxd2070xxx -induced effects on cortical mor ir are
prevented by administration of the opioid receptor antagonist
naloxone. since naloxone competes with opioid agonists in
binding to opioid receptors, 16 this observation indicates that
 xxxd2070xxx -induced effects on mor ir are receptor mediated.
the observation that  xxxd2070xxx  increases both the intensity of
staining and the number of mor-positive neurons indicates
that the amount of available antigen in the cells has increased
(to threshold levels in cells expressing mors at subthreshold
levels in untreated animal); the effect of  xxxd2070xxx  treatment
on mors, therefore, is due to an increase in the number of

mor antigenic sites visualized by the mor antibodies. the
fast time-course of  xxxd2070xxx -induced changes and the observation that the dose of  xxxd2070xxx  used in the present study is
the same, producing endocytosis in both peripheral and
central neurons 8,21 suggest that the increase in the number
of mor ir cells reported here is related to endocytosis. alternatively, the fast time-course of the process could be
explained by hypothesizing that, by uncoupling the a-subunit
of the g-protein from the c-terminal portion of the receptor,
the activation of the receptor might reveal the amino acid
sequence against which the antibody has been raised. this
would increase the number of antigenic sites and could
explain the increased immunostaining observed in the present
material.
the effects observed following  xxxd2070xxx  activation of
mors have important neuroanatomical implications, in that
they show that receptor activation is useful for better visualizing cells expressing the receptor. with this approach, the
visualization of the reaction product can be considerably
improved, particularly for light microscopic studies. indeed,
in the present experimental study, this strategy enabled us to
visualize a greater number of neurons immunoreactive for
mors in the rat cerebral cortex. this methodological improvement may be important considering the relatively low number
of cells expressing mors in the cns, and particularly suitable
for studies aimed at determining percentage of labeled cells and
activity-dependent or chemically induced changes. it remains to
be determined whether the changes described here for mors
also apply to other, or to all, g-protein coupled receptors, which
undergo endocytosis following exposure to agonists, although
the recent report of kramer et al. 10 suggests that this might be
the case. should this be proven for other g-protein coupled
receptors many aspects of previous immunocytochemical
studies might require a re-evaluation.
