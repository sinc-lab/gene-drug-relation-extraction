abstract. objective and design: low level laser therapy
(lllt) has been presented as a novel therapy to treat inflammation. herein we studied the effect of lllt on the
cox-2 mrna expression in subplantar tissue taken from
rats treated with carrageenan.
material: the groups consisted of 32 rats: a1 (saline), a2
(carrageenan), a3 (carrageenan + laser 660 nm) and a4
(carrageenan + laser 684 nm).
treatment: a3 and a4 were irradiated in the first hour after
carrageenan.
methods: the edema was measured by a plethysmometer
and cox-2 mrna was by rt-pcr. statistical were evaluated by anova and tukey-kramer test.
results: carrageenan increased both edema (a1= 0.6 ± 0.04
vs. a2= 2.24 ± 0.08) and cox-2 mrna (a1= 1.1 ± 0.26 vs.
a2= 3.52 ± 0.69). irradiation reduced the edema (a3= 0.84
± 0.09; a4= 1.31 ± 0.05) and the cox-2 mrna (a3= 2.16 ±
0.28; a4= 1.86 ± 0.20).
conclusion: lllt reduce the expression of cox-2 mrna.
key words: inflammation – cox-2 – lllt

introduction
prostaglandins are important mediators for a wide variety
of physiological processes [1]. they are produced by two
distinct cox isoforms, cox-1 and cox-2, which use  xxxd208xxx  as the substrate [2]. cox-1 and cox-2 isoforms present different functions. cox-1 is expressed in
correspondence to: m. s. costa

most cell types, regulating normal physiological functions,
while cox-2 is expressed in different types of activated cells
[2]. the expression of cox-2 mrna has been shown to increase in subplantar tissue taken from rats that are given carrageenan as an inflammation inducing agent [3].
lllt has been used in the treatment of patients with inflammatory pathologies, since it reduces the acute inflammatory process, stimulates healing and relief pain [4].
in the present work, we studied the effect of lllt on the
expression of cox-2 mrna in subplantar tissue obtained
from rats that received carrageenan.
materials and methods
experimental groups
all the experiments were carried according to the guidelines of the university of vale do paraíba for animal care. male wistar rats were given a
subplantar injection (0,5 mg/paw) of either carrageenan (sigma chemical co., st louis, mo, usa) or saline in the left paw, under anesthesia
with halothane.
the experimental groups consisted of 32 rats divided into 4 groups:
a1 (control-saline), a2 (carrageenan alone), a3 (carrageenan + laser
660 nm) and a4 (carrageenan + laser 684 nm). the animals of groups a3
and a4 were irradiated in the first hour after the induction of edema by
carrageenan. the same groups were used to determine both the volume
of edema and the expression of cox-2 mrna (n = 8).

laser irradiation
a diode laser with an output power of 30 mw and a wavelength of either
660 nm (model: laser unit, kondortech) or 684 nm (model: theralase,
dmc) were used. the laser beam covered an area of 0.785 cm2, resulting
in an energy dosage of 7.5 j/cm2.

vol. 56, 2007       cox-2 mrna in carrageenan paw inflammation
table 1. edema volume and cox-2 mrna expression determined 4
hours after carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paw. the experimental conditions are described under materials and methods. the data
are mean ± se (n=8). a statistical analysis by student’s t-test indicated
that p<0.05 (*). a positive statistical correlation was found between
edema volume and cox-2 mrna levels (r= 0.9189).

volumetric measurements of the rat paw edema
the volume of the paw edema (ml) was measured using a plethysmometer (ugo basile, italy, model 7150 plethysmometer,). measurements
were taken both immediately before and 4 h after the carrageenan injection. after determining the edema, the subplantar tissue was immediately removed from the rats and stored in liquid nitrogen.

rt-pcr
total rna was isolated from subplantar muscles by trizol reagent
(gibco brl, gaithersburg, md), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the rna was subjected to dnase digestion, followed by reverse
transcription to cdna, as previously described [5]. pcr was performed
in a 7000 sequence detection system (abi prism, applied biosystems,
foster city, ca) using the sybrgreen core reaction kit (applied biosystems). the primers used were: cox-2 forward primer (genbanktm
accession number j00691) 5′-tgtatgctaccatctggcttcgg3′ and reverse primer (genbanktm accession number nw_047397.1)
5′- gtttggaacagtcgctcgtcatc-3′;  xxxg53xxx  forward primer
(genbanktm accession number j00691) 5′-aagtccctcaccctcccaaaag-3′ and reverse primer (genbanktm accession number
v01217) 5′-aagcaatgctgtcaccttccc-3′. the pcr primer efficiencies were calculated using standard curves, and the relative expression levels of cox-2 in real time were analyzed using the 2deltact method,
presented as the ratio to the expression of the housekeeping gene  xxxg53xxx . each sample was replicated twice from 3 independent sets of rna
preparations.

statistical analysis
statistical differences were evaluated by analysis of variance (anova)
and tukey-kramer multiple comparisons test to determine differences
between groups. the results were considered significant when p < 0.05.
a positive statistical correlation was observed between edema volume
and cox-2 mrna levels (r = 0.919).

results
effect of lllt on carrageenan-induced edema
four hours after the treatment with carrageenan, pronounced
swelling of the paw was observed when compared with the
control group (table 1). however, lllt with a wavelength
of either 660 or 684 nm diminished the formation of edema.

effect of lllt on the cox-2 mrna expression
increased cox-2 mrna levels were observed in the subplantar tissue of animals receiving carrageenan (table 1).
the expression of cox-2 mrna decreased in the animals
receiving lllt 1 h after the administration of carrageenan.
curiously, lllt wavelengths of both 660 and 684 nm were
equally successful in reducing the evolution of edema.
discussion
this is the first report of reduced cox-2 mrna expression
after lllt, using a traditional inflammation model. cox-2
activity is usually absent in most cells. when induced by a
stimulus, the cox-2 level is modified in a matter of hours [6].
the majority of inflammatory diseases are often treated with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticoids. however, the efficacy of lllt in inflammatory processes has been
demonstrated in a variety of experimental models. recently,
our group showed that lllt is able to reduce the evolution of
edema in carrageenan-induced inflammations [7].
taken together, these results suggest that lllt may be
a new alternative therapy in the treatment of inflammatory
disorders, probably activated by a mechanism involving the
reduction of cox-2 expression.
