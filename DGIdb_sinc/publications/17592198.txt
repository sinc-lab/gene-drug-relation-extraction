 xxxd2654xxx , a novel oral hypoglycemic agent, preserves the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning in isolated perfused rat hearts.  diabetic patients often have manifestation of coronary heart disease. as a consequence, therapeutic strategies for diabetes should pay more attention to hypoglycemic agents which do not have adverse effects on myocardium.  xxxd2654xxx  is considered to have little or no impact on the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning (ip) because of its high selectivity for blocking sulfonylurea receptor1 ( xxxg19xxx ). however,  xxxd2215xxx , a nonselective sur blocker, attenuates this beneficial effect. in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that  xxxd2654xxx  preserves the protective action of ip evaluated by ischemia/reperfusion ventricular tachyarrhythmia (rvt) in isolated perfused rat hearts. after initial perfusion, the hearts were assigned to one of the following groups: 1) non-ip with control perfusion buffer (non-ip group); 2) ip with control perfusion buffer (ip-c group); 3) ip with perfusion buffer containing  xxxd2215xxx  (ip-g group); and 4) ip with perfusion buffer containing  xxxd2654xxx  (ip-m group). the protocol for the non-ip group consisted of 21 minutes of aerobic perfusion before 10 minutes of ischemia. in the other 3 groups (ip groups), there were 3 cycles of 2-minute ischemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion before 10 minutes of ischemia. the ip-c group had a significantly shorter rvt duration than the non-ip group (4.4 +/- 1.8 minutes versus 14.3 +/- 2.5 minutes; p < 0.05). rvt duration was the shortest in the ip-m group (3.9 +/- 1.0 minutes), but among the longest in the ip-g group (14.0 +/- 2.6 minutes). in conclusion,  xxxd2654xxx  preserved the cardioprotective effect of ip, however,  xxxd2215xxx  abolished this beneficial effect. therefore,  xxxd2654xxx  may offer a long-term benefit for myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients.
