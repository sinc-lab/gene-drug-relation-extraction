several members of the  xxxg2296xxx  receptor
( xxxg2300xxx ) superfamily can induce cell death. for  xxxg2300xxx , fas/ xxxg764xxx , dr3, dr6,  xxxg2298xxx  and trailr2, a conserved ‘death domain’ in the intracellular
region couples these receptors to activation of caspases.
however, it is not yet known how tnf receptor family
members lacking a death domain, such as  xxxg2301xxx ,
cd40, lt-betar, cd27 or  xxxg2302xxx , execute their deathinducing capability. here we demonstrate in different
cellular systems that cytotoxic effects induced by  xxxg2301xxx , cd40 and  xxxg2302xxx  are mediated by endogenous
production of tnf and autotropic or paratropic activation of  xxxg2300xxx . in addition, stimulation of  xxxg2301xxx 
and cd40 synergistically enhances  xxxg2300xxx -induced
cytotoxicity. these findings describe a novel pro-apoptotic mechanism induced by some members of the
 xxxg2300xxx  family.

introduction
members of the  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) family are
important for the functioning of the immune system, tissue
homeostasis and embryonic development. at the cellular
level, these cytokines activate cell differentiation, cell
proliferation, cell survival or cell death, depending on the
metabolic state of the cell (grell and clauss, 1999). the
ability to kill cells has attracted great attention ever since
the direct cytotoxic effect of the prototypic ligand of this
family, tnf, was discovered (fiers, 1993; ashkenazi
and dixit, 1998). molecules of the tnf ligand family
exert their effects through members of the tnf receptor
( xxxg2300xxx ) family. these are characterized by homologies
in their extracellular region containing two to six copies
of a canonical motif of cysteine-rich pseudorepeats. this
family includes, for example, the transmembrane receptors
3034

 xxxg2300xxx ,  xxxg2301xxx , fas/ xxxg764xxx , cd27,  xxxg2302xxx , cd40,
lt-betar and trail receptors 1, 2, 3 and 4, as well as a
variety of soluble receptors of mammalian and viral origin
(smith et al., 1994; grell and clauss, 1999).
 xxxg2300xxx  family members show little similarity in their
cytoplasmic region with two exceptions. first, several
members of the family can bind to a group of homologous
proteins termed trafs ( xxxg2300xxx -associated factors). however, there is no clearly defined domain within those
receptors to which the traf proteins bind with the
exception of a pxqxt motif found in  xxxg2302xxx ,  xxxg2301xxx , rank and cd40 (arch et al., 1998). secondly, a
homologous sequence of ~65–80 amino acids, termed the
‘death domain’ (dd), was originally identified in fas/
 xxxg764xxx  and  xxxg2300xxx  (itoh and nagata, 1993; tartaglia
et al., 1993). this domain was sequentially found in other
members of the tnf receptor family that can induce cell
death, namely dr3, dr6,  xxxg2298xxx  and trail-r2
(ashkenazi and dixit, 1998). in the case of  xxxg2300xxx  and
fas/ xxxg764xxx  it has been shown that induction of apoptosis
involves dd oligomerization (boldin et al., 1995) and
rapid (within seconds) activation of caspases (kischkel
et al., 1995; boldin et al., 1996). caspases are cysteine
proteases which cleave certain proteins after specific
 xxxd233xxx  residues (thornberry and lazebnik, 1998).
recruitment and activation of  xxxg342xxx  to stimulated
‘death receptors’ is mediated by dd-containing adaptor
proteins such as tradd and  xxxg756xxx / xxxg756xxx  (ashkenazi
and dixit, 1998).
surprisingly, it was found that certain members of the
tnf receptor family, which lack a dd, are also capable of
inducing cell death under certain conditions. for instance,
 xxxg2301xxx  was shown to kill certain cells when overexpressed (heller et al., 1992; vandenabeele et al., 1995;
haridas et al., 1998) and can trigger apoptosis at physiological expression levels in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell
line kym-1 (grell et al., 1993, 1994). moreover, an
involvement of  xxxg2301xxx  in activation-induced cell death
(aicd) was deduced from experiments using tnf-rdeficient mice (zheng et al., 1995). the stimulation of
 xxxg2302xxx , which is expressed on the surface of tumour cells
of hodgkin’s disease, anaplastic large cell lymphomas
(alcl) and lymphoid cells (stein et al., 1985), was
shown to induce cell death of alcl-derived cell lines
and to enhance t cell receptor ligation-induced apoptosis
of t hybridoma cells (smith et al., 1993; lee et al., 1996).
in addition, experiments with  xxxg2302xxx -deficient mice have
indicated that this receptor is involved in the deletion of
autoreactive thymocytes (amakawa et al., 1996). cd40
plays a critical role in t cell-dependent b cell activation,
but can also transmit a death signal in transformed
cells of mesenchymal and epithelial origin (hess and
engelmann, 1996). finally, stimulation of the receptor for
the hetero-trimeric  xxxg1345xxx /lt-beta ligand, lt-betar, can induce

 xxxg2301xxx -induced cell death

apoptosis in some adenocarcinoma cell lines in the
presence of interferon-gamma ( xxxg1141xxx ) (browning et al., 1996).
in contrast to the wealth of information about the
molecular mechanisms of apoptosis signaling by
dd-containing receptors, little is known about the processes that link dd-lacking receptors of the  xxxg2300xxx  family
to the cell death machinery. in the case of  xxxg2302xxx , it was
shown that the c-terminal 66 amino acids, which bind to
traf1 and traf2, are essential for the ability of  xxxg2302xxx 
to enhance t cell receptor signaling-induced apoptosis of
t hybridoma cells (lee et al., 1996). for lt-betar, ligandinduced association of traf3 was implicated in cell
death signaling, because a deletion mutant of traf3
potently inhibited lt-betar- but not fas/ xxxg764xxx -transduced
apoptosis (vanarsdale et al., 1997). interestingly, traf3
has also been reported to interact with  xxxg2302xxx ,  xxxg2301xxx 
and cd40, and has been implicated in cd40-mediated
growth inhibition of epithelial cells (eliopoulos et al.,
1996). in addition, traf-mediated binding of rip2, a
ser/thr kinase, to cd40 has been shown recently
(mccarthy et al., 1998). overexpression of rip2 induces
both activation of  xxxg1559xxx  transcription factors and
apoptosis, but its physiological role in cd40 signaling
remains to be determined.
apart from direct induction of cell death, dd-lacking
receptors of the  xxxg2300xxx  family have been shown to
enhance the cytotoxic effects of dd-containing receptors
in certain conditions (grell et al., 1995; hess and
engelmann, 1996; weiss et al., 1997, 1998). although
the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon are not
entirely understood, interference of the signaling pathways
from dd-containing receptors and dd-lacking receptors
at the level of traf molecules has been suggested. it
has been proposed that this involves dd-lacking receptorinduced sequestration and degradation of traf molecules
(duckett and thompson, 1997; weiss et al., 1998).
here we analyzed the molecular mechanisms by which
dd-lacking receptors of the  xxxg2300xxx  family induce cell
death and show that triggering of  xxxg2301xxx , cd40 and
 xxxg2302xxx  leads to an upregulation of tnf production and
autotropic or paratropic stimulation of  xxxg2300xxx -mediated
cytotoxicity.

kym-1 cells. the cytotoxic effects of  xxxg2300xxx - and  xxxg2301xxx -stimulation were both inhibited by different inhibitors
in a similar range of concentrations (figure 1a and b).
the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zvad-fmk inhibited
 xxxg2300xxx - and  xxxg2301xxx -transduced apoptosis in the nanomolar range. the peptide inhibitors zdevd- xxxg478xxx  and
ac-yvad-cho, which have modest specificity for
caspase-3 and  xxxg340xxx , respectively (thornberry et al.,
1997), affected cell death only at high concentrations
(50–100 µm). the cowpox virus-encoded protein crma
is a potent inhibitor of different pro-inflammatory and
pro-apoptotic caspases, such as  xxxg340xxx  and  xxxg342xxx ,
and blocks tnf- and fasl-induced cell death in vitro and
in vivo (strasser et al., 1995; smith et al., 1996). expression of crma in kym-1 cells not only completely blocked
cytotoxicity induced by tnf (data not shown) or by
antibody mediated stimulation of  xxxg2300xxx , but also
blocked  xxxg2301xxx -induced cell death (figure 1c–e). these
results provide evidence that both tnf receptors use
similar members of the caspase family to induce cell death.
for fas/ xxxg764xxx  two different apoptosis signaling pathways have been identified (strasser et al., 1995; scaffidi
et al., 1998). in one cell type, induction of apoptosis
by fas/ xxxg764xxx  occurred under essential involvement of
mitochondria and could be counteracted by overexpression
of bcl-2 or  xxxg251xxx , whereas in another cell type overexpression of bcl-2 or  xxxg251xxx  had no effect.  xxxg342xxx  was
activated in both cell types although with different kinetics.
to analyze which of these pathways are involved in
 xxxg2300xxx - and  xxxg2301xxx -induced apoptosis, we transfected
expression constructs for several anti-apoptotic molecules
into kym-1 cells. overexpression of bcl-2 or  xxxg251xxx  did
not protect kym-1 cells significantly against cytotoxicity
induced by stimulation of either  xxxg2300xxx  or  xxxg2301xxx 
(figure 1f–k). bcl-2 or  xxxg251xxx  did, however, inhibit cell
death induced by  xxxd3241xxx , etoposide or gamma-irradiation,
demonstrating that functional levels of these proteins were
expressed in these kym-1 transfectants (data not shown).
taken together, the data indicate that  xxxg2301xxx  and  xxxg2300xxx  activate apoptosis by a similar mechanism, which
requires a crma-sensitive caspase, most probably
 xxxg342xxx , and is insensitive to bcl-2 and its homologs.

results

 xxxg2301xxx -induced cell killing is mediated by an
indirect mechanism via increased production of
endogenous tnf and  xxxg2300xxx  activation
in previous experiments we had observed that morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis occur in
kym-1 cells more slowly after  xxxg2301xxx  activation compared with  xxxg2300xxx  stimulation (figure 2a; grell et al.,
1994). this indicated that  xxxg2301xxx  might induce apoptosis
by an indirect mechanism. an important hint for the
mechanisms of  xxxg2301xxx -induced cytotoxicity comes from
a recent study showing an involvement of minute amounts
of endogenously produced tnf in the cytotoxic effects
of hutnf-r2 overexpressed in the mouse fibrosarcoma
cell line l929 (vercammen et al., 1995). in fact, we
found that  xxxg2301xxx -induced cytotoxicity, but not  xxxg2300xxx -induced cell death, in kym-1 cells could be blocked
by human tnf-specific neutralizing mab 357-101-4
(figure 2b and c), mab t1 and mab 195 (data not
shown). even 2 h after  xxxg2301xxx  stimulation, addition
of antibodies to tnf could still block cytotoxicity

 xxxg2300xxx - and  xxxg2301xxx -induced apoptosis of kym-1
cells can both be antagonized by inhibition of
caspases but not by bcl-2 or  xxxg251xxx 
the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line kym-1 was previously
shown to be highly sensitive for the induction of cell
death induced by ligation of either of the two tnf
receptors, and thus represents an ideal model to compare
the pro-apoptotic signaling pathways of the two receptors
(grell et al., 1993). stimulation of either of the two
tnf receptors leads to comparable morphological and
biochemical changes in kym-1 cells, characteristic for
apoptotic cell death. experiments using various signal
transduction inhibitors have suggested differences in the
activation of the apoptotic machinery (grell et al., 1994).
to investigate the role of caspases in the pro-apoptotic
signaling pathways activated by  xxxg2300xxx  and  xxxg2301xxx ,
we tested the effects of various peptide inhibitors of
caspases on  xxxg2300xxx - or  xxxg2301xxx -induced cell death in

fig. 1.  xxxg2300xxx - and  xxxg2301xxx -induced apoptosis in kym-1 cells are both blocked by inhibition of caspases but not by overexpression of bcl-2 or
 xxxg251xxx . (a and b) kym-1 cells were pre-treated for 30 min with the indicated concentrations of the peptide inhibitors zvad-fmk (s), zdevd- xxxg478xxx 
(j) and yvad-cho (n) and subsequently treated overnight with (a) the  xxxg2300xxx -specific mab htr-1 (1:500) or (b) polyclonal  xxxg2301xxx -specific
rabbit igg m80 (1: 500). cell viability was determined by mtt assays and values obtained from untreated cells are indicated by dashed lines.
(c–k) kym-1 clones, stably transfected with expression plasmids for crma (c–e), bcl-2 (f–h) or  xxxg251xxx  (i–k) were treated overnight with
titrated concentrations of the  xxxg2300xxx -specific agonistic mab htr-1 (c, f and i) or polyclonal  xxxg2301xxx -specific rabbit igg m80 (d, g and j), and
cell survival was determined by mtt assays. for each cell death inhibitor results from three independent transfected clones are shown (filled
symbols) versus untransfected cells (open symbols). representative experiments (n ù3) are shown and data points represent mean values of
triplicates 6 sd. (e, h and k) expression of the transgene-encoded proteins (solid line) was determined by immunofluorescence staining and facs
analysis. staining of control vector transfected cells is shown as shaded histograms.

(figure 2d) consistent with the idea that  xxxg2301xxx  triggers
cell death indirectly via the induction of endogenous tnf.
furthermore, addition of soluble  xxxg2300xxx -fc chimeric
proteins, which neutralize tnf, also blocked tnf-r2induced cytotoxicity whereas a similar fas/ xxxg764xxx -fc
construct had no effect (data not shown). this indicates
that induction of endogenous tnf but not fasl is essential
for  xxxg2301xxx -induced cytotoxicity. rnase protection assays
(figure 2e) and rt–pcr analysis (figure 2f) revealed
that the stimulation of either  xxxg2300xxx  leads to increased
3036

expression of tnf mrna in kym-1 cells. the time
course of  xxxg2301xxx -induced upregulation of tnf mrna
(detectable after 2 h) is consistent with the observation
that  xxxg2301xxx -induced cytotoxicity can be blocked by tnfspecific antibodies as late as 2 h after  xxxg2301xxx  stimulation
(figure 2d).
next we analyzed whether or not tnf induced by  xxxg2301xxx  stimulation mediates its cytotoxic effects via  xxxg2300xxx 
binding. in fact, cell death induced by two distinct  xxxg2301xxx -specific stimuli,  xxxg2301xxx -specific antibodies or high

agonistic  xxxg2301xxx -specific reagents polyclonal igg m80 (a) and mab
mr2-1 (b), in the absence (u) or presence of neutralizing tnf-r1specific monovalent (fab)-fragments of mab h398 (j). (c) kym-1
cells were stably transfected with a chimeric receptor construct
consisting of the extracellular domain of the mouse  xxxg1141xxx  receptor and
the cytoplasmic part of the human  xxxg2301xxx  (mifngammar-htnfr2). the
cells were cultured overnight with mouse  xxxg1141xxx  alone (10 ng/ml; filled
bars) or in the presence of neutralizing anti-tnf mab 357-101-4
(30 µg/ml; hatched bars), neutralizing (fab)-fragments of tnf-r1specific mab h398 (30 µg/ml; cross-hatched bars), or neutralizing
(fab)-fragments of  xxxg2301xxx -specific polyclonal igg m80 (30 µg/ml;
open bars). the results using three independent transfected clones and
untransfected kym-1 cells are shown. (d) expression of the chimeric
mifngammar-htnf-r2 molecules in three different clones (solid lines) was
determined by immunofluorescence staining and facs analysis.
staining of untransfected cells is shown in the filled histogram.

fig. 2.  xxxg2301xxx -induced apoptosis in kym-1 cells is mediated by
endogenous tnf. (a)  xxxg2301xxx -induced apoptosis is delayed in
comparison with  xxxg2300xxx -induced apoptosis. kym-1 cells were
treated for the indicated periods with high concentrations of tnf
(1 µg/ml; filled bars),  xxxg2300xxx -specific mab htr-1 (10 µg/ml; hatched
bars) and polyclonal  xxxg2301xxx -specific rabbit serum m80 (1:30; open
bars). cell viability was determined by mtt assays. (b and c)  xxxg2301xxx - but not  xxxg2300xxx -induced apoptosis is inhibited by neutralizing
anti-tnf antibodies. kym-1 cells were incubated overnight in the
absence (open symbols) or presence (filled symbols) of anti-tnf mab
357-101-4 (30 µg/ml) with the following reagents: (b) polyclonal
 xxxg2301xxx -specific rabbit igg m80 (squares) or mab mr2-1 (circles);
(c)  xxxg2300xxx -specific mabs htr-1 (squares) or mab htr-9 (circles).
(d) time dependence of the neutralization of  xxxg2301xxx -induced cell
death. kym-1 cells were treated with titrated concentrations of the
 xxxg2301xxx -specific mab mr2-1 and neutralizing anti-tnf mab 357101.4 was added after 1 h (d), 2 h (j), 3 h (.) or 5 h (r), or was
omitted (u). cell viability in (a–d) was determined by mtt assays.
(e and f) determination of tnf expression. kym-1 cells were
treated for the indicated times with the  xxxg2300xxx -specific mab htr-1
(2 µg/ml) or  xxxg2301xxx -specific mab mr2-1 (1 µg/ml) and expression
of tnf mrna was examined by rnase protection assay (e) or
rt–pcr analysis using human tnf-specific primers (f). the arrows
indicate the tnf-specific nucleic acid fragments and the asterisks
indicate  xxxg53xxx -specific nucleic acid fragments, the level of which was
determined as a control for the rt–pcr.

concentrations of a  xxxg2301xxx -specific mutant of tnf
(tnfd143n-a145r), could be blocked by neutralizing antibodies to  xxxg2300xxx  (figure 3a and b; data not shown).
we wanted to exclude the remote possibility that these
data resulted from (i) interactions between the extracellular
domains of the two tnf receptors (e.g. ligand-induced
 xxxg2300xxx / xxxg2301xxx  heterocomplexes) or (ii) minimal crossreactivities of the  xxxg2301xxx -specific reagents with  xxxg2300xxx .
this could be achieved by generating chimeric receptors
consisting of the extracellular and the transmembrane
domain of mouse  xxxg1141xxx  receptor and the cytoplasmic part
of human  xxxg2301xxx . the extracellular part of the mouse
 xxxg1141xxx  receptor was chosen because mouse  xxxg1141xxx  does
not bind to human  xxxg1141xxx  receptors on kym-1 cells.
transfection of this chimeric receptor construct into
kym-1 cells yielded clones (figure 3d) which could be
killed by mouse  xxxg1141xxx  whereas control kym-1 clones
were resistant (figure 3c). strikingly, the cytotoxic effects
of mouse  xxxg1141xxx  on these transfectants could be blocked
by neutralizing tnf- or  xxxg2300xxx -specific antibodies but
not by  xxxg2301xxx -specific antibodies (figure 3c).

m.grell et al.

(figure 4c). in addition, stimulation of karpas-299 cells
with  xxxg2302xxx -specific mabs or tnf led to an increase in
tnf mrna expression (figure 4d). the inhibition of
 xxxg2302xxx -induced cytotoxicity by neutralizing tnf- or  xxxg2300xxx -specific antibodies was not as potent as in the case of
 xxxg2301xxx - and cd40-induced cell death. this indicates
that  xxxg2302xxx -stimulation can activate cell death by several
mechanisms, only one of which involves production of
tnf. fasl does not appear to be involved since we found
no inhibition of  xxxg2302xxx -induced cell death by addition of
fas/ xxxg764xxx -fc (data not shown). the extent by which
anti-tnf antibodies inhibited  xxxg2302xxx -induced cell death
varied considerably between individual experiments. the
reasons for this variable involvement of endogenous tnf
in  xxxg2302xxx -induced cytotoxicity are not known, but might
be caused by the development of variable tnf resistance
by low level spontaneous tnf expression in these cells
(figure 4d).

fig. 4. a role for endogenous tnf in cd40- and  xxxg2302xxx -induced
cytotoxicity. (a) human hela-cd40 cells were treated overnight with
the concentrations indicated of the cd40-specific mab  xxxg28xxx .5 alone
(u), in the presence of neutralizing anti-human tnf mab (30 µg/ml,
j), or isotype-matched control mabs (s). cell viability was
determined by neutral red uptake. (b) mouse a9-cd40 cells were cocultured with paraformaldehyde-fixed wild-type bhk cells (s) or
bhk cells expressing human  xxxg390xxx  in the absence (u) or presence
of neutralizing anti-mouse tnf mab mp6-xt22 (j), or, as a control,
neutralizing anti-human tnf mab t1 (.). (c) human karpas-299
lymphoma cells were treated overnight with titrated concentrations of
the  xxxg2302xxx -specific mab  xxxg2302xxx  in the absence (u) or presence of
neutralizing tnf-specific mab 195 (j) or  xxxg2300xxx -specific (fab)fragments of mab h398 (s). cell proliferation was determined by
[3h]thymidine uptake. (d) the cells indicated were treated for 5 h
with tnf (10 ng/ml), the cd40-specific mab  xxxg28xxx .5 (1 µg/ml), the
 xxxg2302xxx -specific mab  xxxg2302xxx  as indicated or left untreated and expression
of tnf mrna was examined by rt–pcr using human tnf-specific
primers. the arrows indicate the tnf-specific nucleic acid fragments
and the asterisks indicate  xxxg53xxx -specific nucleic acid fragments.

cd40- and  xxxg2302xxx -induced cell death is also
mediated via increased production of endogenous
tnf and  xxxg2300xxx  activation
next, we investigated whether the cytotoxic effects of
other dd-lacking receptors of the  xxxg2300xxx  family might
be transduced indirectly via production of endogenous
tnf. ligation of cd40 has been shown to result in
apoptotic cell death in cells of mesenchymal and epithelial
origin (hess and engelmann, 1996). in hela cells stably
transfected with cd40 (hela-cd40), induction of cytotoxicity by an agonistic cd40-specific antibody could be
antagonized by neutralizing anti-human tnf mabs
(figure 4a). moreover, in the mouse cell line a9, transfected with cd40 (a9-cd40), cytotoxicity induced by
co-culture with  xxxg390xxx -transfected bhk cells could be
inhibited, albeit not completely, by mouse tnf-specific
antibodies (figure 4b). determination of tnf mrna by
rt–pcr analysis revealed that stimulation with anticd40 antibodies or, as a control with tnf, induced tnf
mrna expression in hela-cd40 cells (figure 4d).
 xxxg2302xxx -induced cytotoxicity in the human karpas-299
lymphoma cell line (smith et al., 1993) could also be
partially inhibited by tnf- or  xxxg2300xxx -specific antibodies

3038

 xxxg2301xxx -, cd40- and  xxxg2302xxx -stimulation induce cell
death through activation of  xxxg2300xxx  by membraneanchored tnf
to determine the amount of tnf produced after  xxxg2301xxx 
stimulation we analyzed the supernatants of tnf-r2stimulated kym-1 cells for soluble tnf protein. interestingly, using a highly sensitive elisa, we could not detect
significant levels of soluble tnf in the supernatants of
kym-1 cells that had been stimulated via  xxxg2301xxx  (figure
5a, left panel). however, increased levels of tnf were
present in the detergent soluble fractions of kym-1 cells
stimulated with  xxxg2301xxx -specific agonistic antibodies or
kym-1-muifngammar- xxxg2301xxx  cells treated with mouse  xxxg1141xxx 
(figure 5a, right panel). in addition, we found that the
supernatant of  xxxg2301xxx -stimulated kym-1 cells did not
contain soluble factors which are cytotoxic for human
kym-1 cells or mouse l929 cells (figure 5b), consistent
with the notion that only insignificant amounts of soluble
tnf are released by these cells. similar results were
obtained from cd40-stimulated cells (data not shown).
finally, inhibition of the protease which processes the
transmembrane form of tnf into soluble trimers by tapi
(black et al., 1997) did not significantly inhibit tnf-r2induced cytotoxicity in kym-1 cells (figure 5c). this
confirms that generation of soluble tnf trimers is not an
essential step in this process. collectively, these data
demonstrate that stimulation of  xxxg2301xxx  and other
dd-lacking receptors of the  xxxg2300xxx  family upregulates
production of endogenous tnf which in its transmembrane form kills cells via an autotropic or paratropic
manner by binding to  xxxg2300xxx .
 xxxg2301xxx -, cd40- and  xxxg2302xxx -stimulation can enhance
 xxxg2300xxx -induced cell death by a mechanism that is
independent of endogenous tnf production
we have recently shown that costimulation of  xxxg2301xxx 
can strongly enhance  xxxg2300xxx -induced cytotoxicity in
cellular systems in which cytotoxicity is completely
dependent on tnf– xxxg2300xxx  interaction (grell et al., 1995;
weiss et al., 1997, 1998). we therefore examined whether
this effect is also exerted by an indirect mechanism
involving  xxxg2301xxx -induced upregulation of tnf production. we investigated the nature of this cooperation under
conditions in which stimulation of  xxxg2301xxx  alone did not

 xxxg2301xxx -induced cell death

period of 6 h was synergistically enhanced in the presence
of agonistic  xxxg2301xxx -specific antibodies (figure 6a). at
that time point no effect of the  xxxg2301xxx -specific agonistic
antibody alone could be observed (see 0 value in figure
6a). in a second experimental setting, we observed that
the cytotoxic effects of an overnight incubation with the
agonistic  xxxg2300xxx -specific mab htr-1 could be strongly
enhanced when co-incubated with  xxxg2301xxx -specific agonistic antibodies. this was done in the presence of neutralizing anti-tnf antibodies to block endogenous tnf (figure
6b). again under these conditions, no significant cytotoxic
effect of  xxxg2301xxx  stimulation alone could be observed.
stimulation of cd40 on hela-cd40 cells also strongly
enhanced  xxxg2300xxx -induced cytotoxicity, even under conditions in which endogenous tnf was neutralized (figure
6c). these data confirm earlier findings that stimulation
of dd-lacking receptors of the  xxxg2300xxx  family, such as
 xxxg2301xxx , cd40 and  xxxg2302xxx , can enhance  xxxg2300xxx -induced
cytotoxic effects (grell et al., 1995; hess and engelmann,
1996; duckett and thompson, 1997) by a mechanism that
is independent of production of endogenous tnf. from
the data of this study we deduce a novel model for the
autoregulatory mechanism by which dd-lacking receptors
of the  xxxg2300xxx  family can participate in the induction of
cell death by two different, but amplifying mechanisms
(figure 7). accordingly, the stimulation of  xxxg2301xxx , cd40
and  xxxg2302xxx  (i) leads to an upregulation of cytotoxic ligands,
such as tnf, and (ii) sensitizes to apoptosis induced by
dd-receptor activation.

discussion

fig. 5.  xxxg2301xxx -induced cytotoxicity in kym-1 cells is mediated by
endogenous membrane-anchored tnf. (a) kym-1 cells were
stimulated for the times indicated via the endogenous  xxxg2301xxx  using
mab mr2-1 (1 µg/ml) or via chimeric muifn gamma r-hutnf-r2
receptors using mouse  xxxg1141xxx  (10 ng/ml). tnf protein concentrations
were determined in the cell supernatants (left panel) or the detergent
soluble cell fractions (right panel) by a tnf-specific elisa. bars
represent mean values 6 sem of three independent experiments each
performed in duplicate or triplicate. (b) no cytotoxic activity is
detectable in the supernatant of kym-1 cells stimulated with agonistic
 xxxg2301xxx -specific antibodies after protein a depletion. in (1), kym-1
cells were treated with  xxxg2301xxx -specific polyclonal rabbit igg m80 in
the absence (filled bars) or presence (hatched bars) of anti-human tnf
mab 357-101-4 (30 µg/ml) or left untreated (open bars). in (2),
centrifuged supernatant from cells treated as described in (1) were
transferred onto fresh kym-1 cultures. in (3), centrifuged supernatant
from cells treated as described in (1) were incubated for 2 h with
protein a–sepharose beads, cleared by centrifugation and transferred
onto fresh kym-1 cultures. in (4), centrifuged supernatant from cells
treated as described in (1) were transferred onto cultures of l929 cells
and 1 µg/ml  xxxd1800xxx  was added. control groups revealed l929
cells to be highly sensitive for soluble human tnf (detection limit
1 pg/ml) but resistant to the hutnfr-2-specific polyclonal rabbit igg
m80 (data not shown). (c) kym-1 cells were stimulated with  xxxg2301xxx -specific agonistic mab mr2-1 (hatched bars),  xxxg2300xxx -specific
agonistic mab htr-1 (open bars) or medium as a control (crosshatched bars) in the presence of different concentrations of tapi, an
inhibitor of the tnf-converting enzyme. cell viability in (b) and (c)
was determined by mtt assays.

the cytotoxic effects of the agonistic  xxxg2300xxx -specific
antibody htr-1 on kym-1 cells after a short incubation

the induction of cell death is an essential part of normal
life itself. the remarkable processes of tissue remodeling
during embryogenesis and the extensive cell turnover in
numerous adult tissues, such as hemopoietic cells, skin
cells and intestinal cells, illustrate the importance of a
regulated mechanism to eliminate cells (jacobson et al.,
1997). cell death control has been adapted to a variety of
physiological needs, particularly in complex organisms.
therefore numerous mechanisms for cell death signaling
have evolved, many of which are the subject of intensive
research. one way for an organism to get rid of unwanted
cells is the selective cell contact-mediated lysis of virusinfected target cells by cytotoxic t cells. other mechanisms
involve soluble cytotoxic factors, such as cytokines, steroid
hormones or glutamate, to which cells are sensitive only
under certain conditions. one fascinating mechanism of
cell death signaling is initiated by interaction of members
of the tnf ligand family with their cellular receptors
(ashkenazi and dixit, 1998).
identification and molecular cloning of a variety of
receptor-associated cytoplasmic factors have unraveled
how stimulation of dd-containing members of the tnfr family, ‘death receptors’, can trigger apoptosis (nagata,
1997; ashkenazi and dixit, 1998). the dd of  xxxg2300xxx ,
fas/ xxxg764xxx , dr3, dr6,  xxxg2298xxx  and trail-r2 couple
activated receptors to dd-containing adaptor molecules
such as tradd and  xxxg756xxx / xxxg756xxx . a second homophilic
interaction motif present in these adaptors, the death
effector domain (ded), couples the activated signaling
complex to the initiator caspase,  xxxg342xxx , which directly
or indirectly initiates degradation of essential cellular

proteins. how signals from dd-lacking  xxxg2300xxx  family
members are coupled to the cell death machinery has until
recently been an open question. here, we demonstrate in
several cellular systems, that induction of cell death by
 xxxg2301xxx , cd40 and, with some restrictions,  xxxg2302xxx  is
mediated indirectly through production of endogenous
membrane-anchored tnf and signaling via  xxxg2300xxx .
at first glance, triggering of cell death via induction of
cytotoxic ligands and subsequent dd-receptor activation
seems to be an attractive and simple way to explain the
cytotoxic effects of various compounds and ligands.  xxxg2301xxx -, cd40- and  xxxg2302xxx -induced cytotoxicity is somewhat
paradoxical, since these receptors are also known to
initiate signaling pathways that promote cell survival, cell
proliferation and cell differentiation (grell and clauss,
1999). cd40-ligation promotes proliferation and differentiation of b lymphocytes and is essential for humoral
immune responses, whereas stimulation of  xxxg2301xxx  and
 xxxg2302xxx  enhance t cell activation. the nature of these
signaling pathways is not fully understood, but it is
assumed that recruitment of members of the traf family
3040

and other adaptor molecules leads to activation of ap-1
and  xxxg1559xxx  transcription factors and expression of cell
growth promoting genes (arch et al., 1998). interestingly,
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  and the jnk/ap-1 signaling pathway
appear to be essential for the induction of tnf and fasl
expression, at least in activated t lymphocytes (jongeneel,
1995; swantek et al., 1997; kasibhatla et al., 1998). it
is therefore conceivable that signals which initiate cell
proliferation and cell activation are accompanied by the
production of cytotoxic cytokines, such as tnf or fasl.
this mechanism may be involved in self-limitation of
immune responses by killing effector cells. it appears,
however, that tnf-producing cells, such as activated
macrophages or t lymphocytes, are resistent to the cytotoxic effects of tnf, at least during the initial stages of
activation.
consistent with an anti-apoptotic function of  xxxg1559xxx 
and ap-1 signaling is the observation that their activation
renders cells resistant to  xxxg2300xxx  stimulation (ashkenazi
and dixit, 1998). why then does induction of tnf
expression by stimulation of  xxxg2301xxx ,  xxxg2302xxx  and cd40,
all of which also activate  xxxg1559xxx  and ap-1, lead to  xxxg2300xxx -transduced apoptosis rather than protect cells from
the toxic effects of tnf? a possible explanation for this
finding comes from data showing that stimulation of
 xxxg2301xxx , cd40 and  xxxg2302xxx  potently enhances tnf-r1transduced cell death (duckett and thompson, 1997;
weiss et al., 1997; this study). several mechanisms
have been suggested by which  xxxg2300xxx - and fas/apo-1induced apoptosis signaling can be amplified at the level
of dd-containing adaptor proteins (varfolomeev et al.,
1996). in addition, release of  xxxg569xxx  and activation
of the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family member bid have been
proposed as a mechanism for amplifying  xxxg2300xxx - and
fas/ xxxg764xxx -induced caspase activation (li et al., 1998;
luo et al., 1998; scaffidi et al., 1998). however,
our data showing that overexpression of bcl-2 or  xxxg251xxx 
in kym-1 cells does not protect kym-1 cells against
 xxxg2300xxx - and  xxxg2301xxx -induced cell death (figure 1) argue
against an involvement of such a mechanism. consistent
with this observation, it was shown that although bcl-2
and  xxxg251xxx  can antagonize bid, they do not inhibit tnfinduced cell death (gross et al., 1999). we and others
demonstrated previously that enhancement of  xxxg2300xxx -

 xxxg2301xxx -induced cell death

induced cell death by  xxxg2301xxx  or  xxxg2302xxx  signaling depends
on the ability of these latter receptors to recruit traf2.
we therefore prefer the idea that degradation of traf2
or interference with its function is the mechanism by
which  xxxg2301xxx , cd40 and  xxxg2302xxx  stimulation enhance the
cytolytic activity of  xxxg2300xxx  (duckett and thompson,
1997; weiss et al., 1998). according to this hypothesis,
prolonged stimulation of  xxxg2301xxx , cd40 or  xxxg2302xxx  would
lead to removal of protective proteins from  xxxg2300xxx ,
rendering the cell more sensitive to  xxxg2300xxx -induced
cytotoxicity. interestingly, the finding of the potent  xxxg2301xxx -mediated enhancement of  xxxg2300xxx -induced cell death
(figures 6 and 7) explains why reagents which significantly
but not completely inhibit cell death induction by  xxxg2300xxx  fail to block  xxxg2301xxx -induced cell death (grell
et al., 1994).
consistent with our observation that the amount of tnf
produced upon  xxxg2301xxx -,  xxxg2302xxx - and cd40-stimulation is
rather low (figure 5), overexpression and stimulation of
hutnf-r2 in mouse l929 fibroblasts resulted in partial
cytotoxicity, which could be neutralized by mouse tnfspecific antibodies, although tnf protein could not be
detected (vercammen et al., 1995). our discovery that
upon  xxxg2301xxx -stimulation tnf is upregulated in its membrane-anchored form without significant processing to the
soluble trimers (figure 5) provides an explanation for this
phenomenon. it is pertinent that membrane-anchored tnf
and fasl are more potent inducers of apoptosis than their
soluble trimers, and it is possible that the former is the
only one that triggers cell death under physiological
conditions (eissner et al., 1995; grell et al., 1995;
schneider et al., 1998; strasser and o’connor, 1998;
tanaka et al., 1998). in line with this argument is recent
work demonstrating that ligation of cd40 on hepatocytes
can lead to an upregulation of fas/ xxxg764xxx  and fasl, and
subsequent autocrine/paracrine apoptosis (afford et al.,
1999).
apart from indirect induction of cell death by  xxxg2301xxx ,
cd40 and  xxxg2302xxx  via upregulation of tnf and fasl, other
more direct effects of these receptors on cell viability
must also be considered. this is suggested by work
showing that the fas/ xxxg764xxx -independent component of
aicd of cd81 t cells in vitro is abrogated in cells of
 xxxg2301xxx -deficient mice but normal in cells of tnf-r1deficient animals (zheng et al., 1995). obviously, a  xxxg2301xxx -induced tnf– xxxg2300xxx  interaction cannot take place
in this scenario. however, this tnf-dependent component
of aicd is a slow process when compared with fas/apo1-induced apoptosis. accordingly, the  xxxg2301xxx -activated
traf2 degradation or interference with traf-2 function
might be a mechanism by which this process occurs.
deletion of cd81 t cells induced by triggering with
supra-optimal antigen concentrations also relies on a tnf–
 xxxg2301xxx  interaction without an obvious involvement of
 xxxg2300xxx  (alexander-miller et al., 1998). this indicates
that  xxxg2301xxx  might play a specialized role in the induction
of cell death in this subset of t cells. the role of the two
tnf receptors in the deletion of peripheral t lymphocytes
in the whole animal is still a matter of debate (sarin et al.,
1995; zheng et al., 1995; speiser et al., 1996; zhou et al.,
1996), and it is clear that distinct pathways for the
induction of lymphocyte apoptosis exist (strasser, 1995).
in conclusion, our study reveals a novel autoregulatory

mechanism by which dd-lacking receptors of the tnfr family, such as  xxxg2301xxx , cd40 and  xxxg2302xxx  participate
in the induction of cell death namely by (i) upregulation
of cytotoxic ligands, such as tnf, and (ii) sensitization
of cells to apoptosis by a signaling pathway which is
independent of endogenous tnf. these data add to the
knowledge of how members of the  xxxg2300xxx  family are part
of the intricate network of cell death signaling.

expression constructs and transfections
the expression vectors for bcl-2 (pef bcl-2/neo), flag epitope-tagged
human bcl-2 (pef flag-bcl-2/puro), flag- xxxg251xxx  (pef flag-bclxl/puro) and flag-crma (pef flag-crma/puro) have been described
previously (strasser et al., 1995; huang et al., 1997). the pcdm8/gammar-p80
plasmid was generated by replacing the extracellular and transmembrane
domains of a pcdm8-based  xxxg2301xxx -expression plasmid (weiss et al.,
1997) by an amplicon comprising amino acids 1–276 of the mouse
 xxxg1141xxx  receptor using the unique bsphi site located two amino-acids
downstream of the transmembrane domain of  xxxg2301xxx  and the hindiii
site of the pcdm8 stuffer. the cdna for this chimeric receptor
was subsequently amplified using the following oligo-nucleotides: 59caagatctcggaatgggcccgcag-39 and 59-cgtctagattaactgggcttcatcccagc-39, digested with bglii and xbai, and the
resulting fragment subcloned into the bamhi and xbai sites of the pefpgk/puro vector (huang et al., 1997) to produce the pef-muifngrhutnfr2/puro expression vector. the construct was fully sequenced
(abi prism™, perkin-elmer, foster city, ca) before transfection of
the dna. transfections of kym-1 cells were performed by electroporation using a gene-pulsar (bio-rad, münchen, germany) essentially as
described (strasser et al., 1995), or by liposome-mediated gene transfer
using pfx™-2 (invitrogen, san diego, ca) or superfect™ (qiagen,
hilden, germany), all according to the manufacturers’ protocols. independent clones of transfected cells were picked after selection with

m.grell et al.
400 µg/ml  xxxg418xxx  (gibco-brl, eggenstein, germany) or 3 µg/ml  xxxd3041xxx  (sigma, deisenhofen, germany), and transgene-expressing cells were
identified by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometric analysis
on a facscan (becton dickinson, san jose, ca). cells were either
surface stained or stained after fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilization with 0.3% saponin (sigma) as described previously
(strasser et al., 1995), using the primary mabs mouse anti-human bcl-2
(bcl-2-100), mouse anti-flag m2 monoclonal antibody (sigma) or rat
anti-mouse  xxxg1142xxx  monoclonal antibody gr20 followed by fitclabeled secondary antibodies.

rna analysis
for rnase protection assays, 5–103106 cells were treated with the
reagents indicated and rna was subsequently isolated with the rneasy
rna purification kit (qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. the rna samples were analyzed for the presence of
hutnf transcripts with the riboquant rnase protection assay system
(pharmingen, hamburg, germany) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations using the multi-probe human cytokine template set
 xxxg1028xxx -3. l32 and  xxxg861xxx  were included as internal controls. protected
transcripts were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under
denaturing conditions and signals were quantified on a phosphorimager
(molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca). for rt–pcr analyses, total
rna of stimulated cells was isolated and transcribed into cdna using
the first-strand cdna synthesis kit (pharmacia, uppsala, sweden)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. tnf-specific pcrs
were performed using the following primers: forward, 59-cttctgcctgctgcactttgga-39; reverse, 59-tcccaaagtagacctgcccaga-39, giving a product of 548 bp. pcr cycle conditions were
94°c for 80 s, 60°c for 150 s, 72°c for 180 s, for 30 cycles. samples
were resolved on agarose gels and pcr products visualized with ethidium
bromide staining.
elisa
cells were seeded in 6-well plates (0.73106 per well) overnight. the
next day, the culture medium was changed and 1 h later cells were
stimulated in a total volume of 2 ml medium as indicated. the
supernatants were kept, the cells were harvested and cell pellets were
lysed in 110 µl of 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.5) containing 150 mm
nacl, 1 mm edta, 1% triton x-100 and protease inhibitors for 30 min
on ice. the lysed cells were centrifuged at 14 000 g to remove cellular
debris and and samples were calibrated for protein concentrations using
the bio-rad protein assay kit (bio-rad, münchen, germany). tnf
protein levels in the cellular supernatants and detergent soluble cellular
fractions were determined using a human tnf-specific elisa
(pharmingen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, using titrations
of human tnf as standard to calibrate the system. color development
was measured at 405 nm with a r5000 elisa plate reader (dynatech,
guernsey, gb). background reactions were determined by omitting the
primary elisa antibody and resulting values were subtracted.
viability assays
cell survival assays were performed as described previously (grell et al.,
1993, 1995; hess and engelmann, 1996). briefly, kym-1 cells, hela
cells, or karpas-299 cells (1–33104 per well) were seeded into 96-well
microtiter plates in a final volume of 200 µl in the presence of the
different cell death-inducing reagents. after the indicated times, the
metabolic activity or viability of the cells was determined by the
mtt-method, by neutral red uptake or [3h]thymidine incorporation as
indicated. cytotoxicity assays using hela-cd40 cells were performed
in the presence of cycloheximide as described previously (hess and
engelmann, 1996).
