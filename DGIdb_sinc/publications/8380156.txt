chemical svnthesis of la-oh-dht?. ir-oh-dht,. 1a-oh-dht:z.
i@-oh-dht,: and 1~~,25-(0h)~dht~:cota et al. (1988) have reported on the application of a hydrotitanation-protonation reaction
sequence to the efficient reduction of vitamin dz or its (5ei-isomer
to mixtures of the corresponding (le. 52 or 5e) 10,19-dihydrovitamins dp, including dht, (5e, 1 0 s ) (fig. 1). the presence of the free
hydroxyl at the 3(p) position was associated with thestereoselective
formation of the 10sisomer under their optimalconditions. in order
to investigate a corresponding reaction in the synthesisof la-(oh) xxxd1891xxx  [(5e, 10r (sic)] (fig. 2 a ) , a synthesis of themono-(tertbutyldimethylsilyl) (tbdms) ether 2 or la-(oh)-(5e)-dzwas projected. this bis-tbdms ether ( i ) , an intermediate in the synthesis
of the anti-psoriaticmc 903 and other vitamin
d analogs (calverley,
1987a), could be selectively monodesilylated by an indirectprocedure.
controlled bf3-etherate treatment(kelly et al, 1979) of the mixture
of adducts (calverley, 1987a) formed with sulfur dioxide, followed by
the usual thermal cheletropic extrusion of sulfurdioxide, gave, in
addition to a little diol, the two mono-tbdms ethers of la-(oh)(5e)-dz, readily distinguished by their ‘h nmr spectra. the minor
product was identical with the 3-0-tbdms ether, an intermediate
major
in the synthesis of i (calverley, 1987a), and therefore the
product was the new 1-0-tbdms ether(2).
reduction of the monosilylated compound 2 under the appropriate
conditions described by cota et al. (1988) (using lithium aluminum
hydride as the hydride source) was highly stereoselective (>99%),
even more so than in theirwork in the 1-unsubstitutedseries, and by
analogy the product isassigned the (dht)c-10 configuration shown
( 3 ) .however, in the absenceof literature references to 1-substituted
was
analogs, it was essential to confirm that the dht structure
indeed correct by preparing derivativesof the otherpossible la-(oh)dihydrovitamins d for comparison. the use of the red-a1 (aldrich)
(naa1h2(0ch20ch3)z) reagent
as the hydride source (shownby cota
et al. (1988) to result in a non-stereoselective reaction in their work)
in the reductionof 2 gave in fact a 4:l mixture of c-10 epimers, with
3 still predominating. a detailed analysis of the ’h nmr spectra’ of
3 and its (10s)-epimer confirms the configurational assignment
made
here.(for a commentonthe
exclusion of the possibility of 52isomers, see below). desilylation of 3 with hydrofluoric acid gave the

non-stereoselective reduction of the bis-tbdms ether

gave a -2:l mixture of 10,19-dihydro derivatives ( 4 a and 46), but the
use of this route to la-(oh)-dhtzwas hampered by the difficulty of
chromatographically separating either4a or the derived 5a from their
respective 10-epimers (46, 56). however, it wasfoundfortuitously

dht in the liver gave rise to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol
(25-oh-dht) (hallick and deluca, 19721, although the exact nature of the cytochrome pdb0involved was never elucidated. the next step in the activation process of vitamin d,
namely la-hydroxylation, was not considered to be necessary
for dht primarily because of the observation that dht
could be used to successfully treat hypocalcemia in anephric
and chronic renal failure patients, despite the fact that these
patients lacked significant renal 25-oh-d3-la-hydroxylase,
the key enzyme in la,25-(oh)zd3 formation, andit was
believed that 25-oh-dht might be the active calcemic metabolite whichwould bind sufficiently well tothe 1,25(oh)zd3-receptor(vdr) by virtue of its 3p-hydroxyl acting
as a “pseudo la-hydroxyl” group (wing et al., 1974; procsal
et al., 1975). in more recent years this idea has been under
question after bosch et al. (1985a, 1985b, 1987) found polar
metabolites in the blood of rats given  xxxd1891xxx ,
( xxxd1891xxx ) and tentatively identified them as a mixture of laand l~,25-d~hydroxydihydrotachysterolz.
one question left
unanswered by bosch et al. (1987)was whether either of these
polar metabolites could bind to thevdr in vitamin d target
cells such as the intestine to produce ca” transport effects
(haussler, 1986).
recently, jones et al. (1988) described the extensive metabolism of dihydrotachysterol3 in vivo and metabolism of 25hydroxydihydrota~hysterol~
in a perfused rat kidney in vitro.
seven major metabolites of 25-oh-dht3 were isolated and
identified and all were shown to be compounds on catabolic
pathways analogous to the24 oxidation and lactone pathways
of the vitamin d metabolite, 25-oh-d3 (jones et al., 1987;
yamada et al., 1984). one other polar metabolite of dhtb (an
analogous one is also formed from dht,), formed in viva and
termed peak h, was not identified in this study but showed a
striking chromatographic resemblance to bosch’s (bosch et
al., 1985a, 1985b) metabolite of dht,. we concluded that
these metabolites were produced extrarenally, and preliminary results showed that peak h has high affinity for the
vdr (jones et al., 1988). peak h from dht, has never been
identified and bosch‘s metabolite of dht, was tentatively
assigned its structure as 1,25-(oh)zdhtz
on the basis of mass
spectral interpretations only.
the present study seeks to confirm the extrarenal l-hydroxylation of dht by ( a ) generating a series of 1,25-dihydroxy dhts from the chemically synthesized 1-hydroxycounterparts using an in vitro hepatoma cell line; ( b ) comparing
these in vitro synthesized metabolites with the in vivo generated metabolites of both dht3 anddht, (i.e. t3/h andt2/
h); ( c ) measuring the  xxxg2412xxx  and vitamin dbinding globulin (dbp) binding properties of these metabolites as well as their ability to stimulate gene expression in a
vitamin d-dependent vdre-gh reporter expression system.
further information about the metabolism of dht and the
formation of these 1,25-dihydroxylated metabolites may provide an explanation for the calcemic effects of dht andmay,
in addition, provide further information about structural features of vitamin d analogs which may be of value in studies
seeking to develop compounds whichshow a selective cell
differentiating effect without concomitant hypercalcemia and
vice versa.

in vivo metabolism of  xxxd1891xxx 
the injection of [10,19-3h]dht3into rats resulted in the
appearance of two major metabolites in the blood.fig. 3
shows a chromatographic profile obtained from such a rat
plasma extract where peaks were identified by comigration
with samples obtained from plasma of rats dosed with dht,
or synthesized as previously described (jones et al., 1988).
the first metabolite, [10,19-3h]25-oh-dht,,is analogous to
one of twomajor metabolites identified earlier as 25-ohdht, by bosch et al. (1985a, 1985b). the second and more
polar metabolite comigrates with peak h which was isolated
