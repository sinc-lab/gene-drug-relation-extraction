abstract
we studied the antitumor activity and toxicity of
 xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ), a specific inhibitor of  xxxg2366xxx  (ts), in nude mice bearing human head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma a253 and fadu xenografts. mice
were treated by single i.v. push (i.v. 3 1), i.v. push once a
week for 3 weeks (weekly 3 3), and i.v. push once a day for
5 days (daily 3 5), and the maximum tolerated doses
(mtds) of  xxxd3077xxx  were 300 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg/week, and 30
mg/kg/day, respectively.  xxxd3077xxx  was moderately active
against both a253 and fadu xenografts. antitumor activity
was schedule-dependent in both tumors: weekly 3 3 > i.v. 3
1 .. daily 3 5. in contrast, the rank order of toxicity was
daily 3 5 .. weekly 3 3 > i.v. 3 1.  xxxd3077xxx  at the mtd
produced 20% complete tumor regression and 20% partial
tumor regression (pr) with i.v. 3 1 and weekly 3 3 schedules and 12-day tumor growth delay with daily 3 5 schedule
against fadu xenografts. no complete tumor regression was
achieved with  xxxd3077xxx  with any schedule against a253; a
20% pr, 40% pr, and 10-day tumor growth delay were
observed with i.v. 3 1, weekly 3 3, and daily 3 5 schedules,
respectively. the data indicate that  xxxd3077xxx  was slightly
more effective against fadu than against a253. of interest
and potential clinical importance was the observation that
 xxxd3077xxx  was still active at doses lower than the mtd (>1/3
mtd), which showed a high therapeutic index and wide
safety margin. study of  xxxd3077xxx  compared with 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2*-deoxyuridine at the mtd revealed that
the antitumor activity of  xxxd3077xxx  was comparable with or
superior to 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2*-deoxyuridine
against both a253 and fadu xenografts, with less toxicity.

study of antitumor activity and toxicity of ts inhibitors with
human tumor xenografts grown in the mouse. to test this
hypothesis, we preadministered methoxypolyethyleneglycolconjugated  xxxg2365xxx  (mpeg-tpase; 2500
units/kg/dose) to reduce mouse plasma thymidine, then
treated with various doses of  xxxd3077xxx  using the daily 3 5 or
i.v. 3 1 schedules in the a253 tumor model. mpeg-tpase
significantly increased the toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx ; the mtd of
 xxxd3077xxx  plus mpeg-tpase was reduced 3- and 10-fold compared with  xxxd3077xxx  alone for i.v 3 1 and daily 3 5 schedules, respectively. however, preadministration of mpegtpase did not potentiate the antitumor activity of  xxxd3077xxx 
with either schedule. the data indicate that the study of ts
inhibitors in rodent models may not be suitable for predicting a safe dose for clinical study. however, rodent models,
particularly human tumor xenografts, are still useful models
for evaluation of antitumor activity and schedule selection
for ts inhibitors.

introduction
head and neck cancer, especially squamous cell cancer
(which accounts for 80 – 85% of tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract) continues to present a major therapeutic challenge in
clinical settings. standard therapy for head and neck cancer is
focused on local and regional approaches, such as surgery or
radiation therapy, or both (1, 2). however, most patients present
with metastatic or locally recurrent disease and cannot be treated
with surgery or radiation therapy; they generally receive chemotherapy (3). in this setting, several agents were identified as
active with 10 –30% response rates, but were not curative (3, 4).
use of drug combinations (e.g., cisplatin/fura3, cisplatin/paclitaxel) results in significantly higher response rates (40 –50%);
however, the response duration is short, and overall survival is
unchanged (5, 6) and is often associated with increased toxicities (3). as the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of head
and neck cancer expands, the identification of new active agents
remains a high priority.
 xxxd3077xxx  is a quinazoline antifolate that is a highly specific
ts inhibitor (7). cellular uptake of  xxxd3077xxx  is via the reducedfolate carrier and it subsequently undergoes rapid and extensive
intracellular polyglutamylation (8). polyglutamylation increases

fig. 1 determination of the mtd of  xxxd3077xxx  in nude mice with or
without hnscc a253 or fadu xenografts. all treatments were administered by i.v. push. f, i.v. 3 1 (day 0); œ, weekly 3 3 (days 0, 7, and

after treatment. each group represents 10 –30 animals of two to six
independent experiments.

drug potency and intracellular retention, which allows a convenient infrequent dosing schedule (8). polyglutamylation also
occurs in various tissues, resulting in a high tissue:plasma drug
ratio (8).
in vitro studies showed  xxxd3077xxx  to be a potent inhibitor of
the growth of both mouse and human tumor cell lines, with an
ic50 in the 1–10 nm range for continuous exposure (8). this is
equivalent in potency to methotrexate, but 94- and 56-fold more
potent than fura alone and fura plus 10 mm lv, respectively
(8). in vivo studies with  xxxd3077xxx  showed it was curative in mice
bearing l5178y tk 2/2 lymphoma and l1210:icr ascitic
tumors (8, 9). it was also active against human colon, gastric,
lung, and ovarian cancers and was superior to fura and methotrexate against these xenografts (10).
clinical trials with  xxxd3077xxx  demonstrated that it is active in
a number of solid tumors, including colorectal (11–15), breast
(11, 16), head and neck (17), ovarian (11), non-small-cell lung
(11), and pancreatic (11) cancers.  xxxd3077xxx  is currently being
investigated in phase i and ii studies in patients with hormoneresistant prostate cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, and pediatric and
adult leukemias (15).  xxxd3077xxx  had similar efficacy to fura/lv
therapy, with a 25–30% response rate in patients with advanced
colorectal cancer, but induced less mucositis and leucopenia. in
addition, patients who received  xxxd3077xxx  spent a substantially
shorter time in the hospital for drug administration than those
who received fura/lv (13–15).  xxxd3077xxx  treatment also offered
more frequent palliative benefits and a more convenient administration schedule (13–15).  xxxd3077xxx  is now available in more
than 10 countries for first-line treatment of advanced colorectal
cancer (15). in a phase ii study of advanced breast cancer,
 xxxd3077xxx  achieved a 26% overall response rate and a 44%
response rate in patients with measurable liver lesions (16).

cytotoxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  is completely reversed by coincubation with  xxxd3364xxx  or lv in vitro (9, 18, 19). the toxicities and
antitumor activity of  xxxd3077xxx  can be abrogated by coadministration of  xxxd3364xxx  or lv in vivo (9, 20). these results demonstrate
that ts is the locus of action of  xxxd3077xxx  for both antitumor
effect and toxicity. high circulating levels of  xxxd3364xxx  in rodents
relative to humans ('1.3 and ,0.1 mm, respectively) may
complicate the study of toxicity and antitumor activity of ts
inhibitors (7, 21). wilson et al. (22) reported that administration
of 2500 units/kg of mpeg-tpase could reduce mouse plasma
 xxxd3364xxx  levels from 1–2 mm to undetectable levels (,0.2 mm);
coadministration of mpeg-tpase with 1843u89, a benzoquinazoline ts inhibitor, potentiated the in vivo activity of 1843u89
in a tumor-specific manner by reduction of  xxxd3364xxx .
the principal objectives of this study were to determine:
(a) the antitumor efficacy of  xxxd3077xxx  against human hnscc
established in nude mice; (b) the role of the dosing schedule of
 xxxd3077xxx ; and (c) the effect of plasma  xxxd3364xxx  on the antitumor
activity and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  in nude mice. the human
hnscc a253 and fadu models in athymic nude mice were
used to test the antitumor efficacy and determine the role of the
dosing schedule of  xxxd3077xxx  with three clinically relevant schedules [single i.v. push (i.v. 3 1) versus i.v. push once a week for
3 weeks (weekly 3 3) versus i.v. push once a day for 5 days
(daily 3 5)] and to compare the effect of  xxxd3077xxx  with fura and
 xxxd2117xxx  on the weekly schedule. we also investigated the antitumor activity and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  after preadministration of
mpeg-tpase in the a253 model.

materials and methods
chemicals.  xxxd3077xxx  was kindly supplied by zeneca
pharmaceuticals (macclesfield, united kingdom). fura and
 xxxd2117xxx  were obtained from hoffmann-la roche, inc. (nutley,
nj).
mice. female athymic nude mice (nu/nu, body weight
20 –25 g), 8 –12 weeks of age, were obtained from harlan
sprague dawley, inc. (indianapolis, in). they were housed five
mice/cage under specific pathogen-free conditions with water
and food ad libitum, according to an institutionally approved
protocol.
tumors. the hnscc cell lines a253 and fadu were
purchased from american type culture collection (manassas,
va) and maintained as a monolayer in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (atlanta biologicals,
norcross, ga). xenografts were initially established by implanting s.c. 106 cultured a253 or fadu cells and passed several
generations by transplanting '50 mg nonnecrotic tumor tissues
before treatment.
preparation of mpeg-tpase. mpeg-tpase was prepared essentially as described (22, 23). briefly, tpase (sigma
t-3678; 12,500 units, 370 mg total protein), supplied in 0.5 m
k-phosphate (ph 7.0), 2 mm uracil, 0.02% nan3, and 2.5%
(w/v) bsa was dialyzed for 24 h at 4°c against 150 mm
na-phosphate (ph 7.0), containing 2.5 mm thymine, with three
changes of 1 liter each. to the dialyzed tpase, solution (30.5
ml) was added slowly with stirring, 3.5 g of solid mpegsuccinimidyl succinate (sigma m3152; '75% pure, molecular
weight (mw) ' 5000). the mixture was allowed to stir at 4°c

at which time the mouse was sacrificed. the response rate was
expressed as a percentage of animals in the group. in general,
tumor in mice with prs regrew within 2 weeks after therapy.
however, tumors rarely (,5%) regrew after crs occurred

tumor weight exceeded 2000 mg. each experimental group had
five mice, and each experiment was repeated at least once.

mtd and toxicity evaluation. the mtd was defined
as the maximum dose that caused no drug-related lethality and
produced ,20% loss of initial animal weight. drug-induced
toxicities, including body weight loss and lethality, were determined daily for a minimum of 3 weeks after treatment.
tumor measurement. two axes of the tumor (l, longest axis; w, shortest axis) were measured with a vernier caliper.
tumor weight (mg) was calculated as: 1⁄2 (l 3 w2) (mm).
relative tumor volume (%) was calculated by actual tumor
weight (atw) over initial tumor weight (itw, day 0) as following: atw 4 itw 3 100%.
measurements were taken once a day during the first 10
days and two to three times a week thereafter.
antitumor activity. drug treatments were initiated 7– 8
days after tumor transplantation when tumor weight was ;200 –
250 mg, as described previously (25). antitumor activity was
assessed by tgi, which is mean tumor weight (mtw) of the
treated group (tg) relative to the untreated control group
(cg) on day 12, as calculated as: (mtwtg –mtwcg) 4
mtwcg 3 100%. the tdt was defined as the mean time for
the tumor to reach twice its initial weight (at treatment beginning, day 0). tumor response was defined as pr, when tumor
weight was temporarily reduced by at least 50%, and cr, when

determination of the mtd of  xxxd3077xxx . to identify the
mtd of  xxxd3077xxx , nude mice with or without a253 or fadu
xenografts were treated with various drug doses, administered
by three different schedules. the mtds of  xxxd3077xxx  were 300
mg/kg, 60 mg/kg/week (180 mg/kg/course), and 30 mg/kg/day
(150 mg/kg/course) for i.v. 3 1, weekly 3 3, and daily 3 5
schedules, respectively (fig. 1). we also compared i.v. to i.p.
injection; the mtd of i.p.  xxxd3077xxx  was the same as for i.v.
injection with single and weekly 3 3 schedules, but the mtd
for i.p.  xxxd3077xxx  was lower (20 mg/kg/day) with the daily 3 5
schedule. in general, lethality was observed in a significant
number of animals when body weight loss was .20% of their
original weight.
antitumor activity and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  with different schedules: role of dose and schedule. table 1 summarizes the antitumor activity and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  with three
different schedules at various doses (# mtd).  xxxd3077xxx  at the
mtd produced a 20% cr and a 20% pr with i.v. 3 1 or
weekly 3 3 schedules, and 12-day tumor growth delay (fig. 2)
with the daily 3 5 schedule against fadu xenografts.  xxxd3077xxx 
did not achieve cr against a253; however, 20% pr, 40% pr,
and a 10-day tumor growth delay (fig. 2) were observed with
i.v. 3 1, weekly 3 3, and daily 3 5, respectively. of note,
 xxxd3077xxx  was still active at doses lower than the mtd against
both tumors (table 1), demonstrating its significant chemotherapeutic index and safety margin. the tumor growth inhibitory
curves and the animals’ body weight loss produced by  xxxd3077xxx 
at the mtd with three different schedules are illustrated in fig.
2. the data clearly demonstrated that single and weekly schedules were more active and less toxic than the daily schedule
(fig. 2).  xxxd3077xxx  administered i.p. also showed a similar pattern
of antitumor activity and toxicity with the three schedules (data
not shown).

which showed both fura and  xxxd2117xxx  were much more active
with a weekly schedule than with single and daily schedules (26,

(table 2). however,  xxxd3077xxx  showed wider deviation of tumor
response in individual animals than did fura and  xxxd2117xxx  in both
models (fig. 3).
the effect of  xxxd3364xxx  on the antitumor activity and
toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx . high levels of plasma  xxxd3364xxx  in the nude
mouse could affect the antitumor activity and toxicity of a ts
inhibitor, such as  xxxd3077xxx . to test this hypothesis, we used
mpeg-tpase to reduce plasma  xxxd3364xxx  levels (22), to see whether
and how profoundly the antitumor activity and toxicity of
 xxxd3077xxx  were affected at low plasma  xxxd3364xxx  in the a253 model.

with the daily 3 5 schedule of  xxxd3077xxx  6 mpeg-tpase,
mpeg-tpase was administered i.p. at 2500 units/kg, 1 h before
the first, third, and fifth doses of  xxxd3077xxx  (three doses in total).
mpeg-tpase shifted the dose-response curve to the left, the
mtd of  xxxd3077xxx  with mpeg-tpase was reduced about 10-fold
compared with  xxxd3077xxx  alone (fig. 4). however, mpeg-tpase
did not alter the pattern of antitumor activity or toxicity of
 xxxd3077xxx ; tgi, tdt, and tumor response and weight loss at the
mtd of  xxxd3077xxx , with or without mpeg-tpase, were comparable (p . 0.05; fig. 5 and table 3).
we also studied  xxxd3077xxx  6 mpeg-tpase on the i.v. 3 1
schedule in the same tumor model. mpeg-tpase was administered i.p. at 2500 units/kg 1 h before  xxxd3077xxx . the data in fig.
6 and table 4 shows no significant difference in tgi, tdt, and
tumor response between  xxxd3077xxx  plus mpeg-tpase and

alone were excluded). the data indicate mpeg-tpase did not
augment the antitumor activity of  xxxd3077xxx  at an equitoxic dose,
but a 3-fold dose reduction was evidenced.

discussion
we used human head and neck xenograft models in nude
mice to study the antitumor activity and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  and
to determine the role of schedule of administration. moreover,
we studied the effect of plasma  xxxd3364xxx  on the antitumor activity
and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  in one model. we have tried to answer
three questions in this investigation: (a) is  xxxd3077xxx  active
against human head and neck cancer in these animal models? (b)
what is the optimal schedule for  xxxd3077xxx  in these animal
models? and (c) does plasma  xxxd3364xxx  affect the antitumor activity
and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  in the mouse model system? and, if so,
how profoundly? the answer to the latter question can determine whether nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts are
appropriate tumor models to evaluate the antitumor activity and
toxicity of ts inhibitors.
 xxxd3077xxx  is a direct and specific ts inhibitor that lacks the
nonspecific effects on rna and protein synthesis of fura; it
was hypothesized that  xxxd3077xxx  would have similar antitumor
efficacy, but fewer side effects than fura (28 –31). indeed, in
clinical phase iii trials of patients with advanced colorectal
cancer,  xxxd3077xxx  showed similar efficacy compared with
fura/lv therapy, but induced less toxicities and improved
palliative benefits (13–15). our data herein also demonstrate
that  xxxd3077xxx  had a better therapeutic index than fura and
 xxxd2117xxx  in human hnscc models (table 2).
earlier preclinical studies demonstrated that  xxxd3077xxx  is
active against a range of human solid tumors including colon,
ovarian, lung, gastric, bladder, and breast xenografts (8). preliminary data from phase i trials showed zd1696 was moderately active in patients with head and neck cancer; two of five
patients achieved minor responses (15).  xxxd3077xxx  as monotherapy with or without radiotherapy in patients with head and
neck cancer has entered a phase ii trial in europe and the united
states (32, 33). to our knowledge, no preclinical in vivo data
with  xxxd3077xxx  against head and neck tumor has been reported to

date, although it was active against a wide panel of murine and
human tumors (8 –10). our data indicate that  xxxd3077xxx  is moderately active against human hnscc fadu and a253 xenografts in a schedule-dependent manner (table 1 and fig. 2).
of interest and potential clinical importance was the finding that
 xxxd3077xxx , unlike fura with which optimal antitumor activity is
achieved only with doses at or near the mtd (34), was active at
doses lower than the mtd, particularly with weekly and single
schedules (table 1). the data indicate that  xxxd3077xxx  had a large
chemotherapeutic index and safety margin and may not need to
be given at the mtd in the clinic. the comparative study of
 xxxd3077xxx  with fura and  xxxd2117xxx  showed the antitumor activity of
 xxxd3077xxx  was similar to fura, but superior to  xxxd2117xxx , against
a253 and was more active than both fura and  xxxd2117xxx , in terms
of cr against fadu with less toxicity (table 2). however,
 xxxd3077xxx  showed wider deviation of tumor response in an individual animal than fura and  xxxd2117xxx  in both models (fig. 3); this
may relate to different individual plasma  xxxd3364xxx  levels. the in
vivo data also indicate that a253 is slightly less sensitive than
fadu to  xxxd3077xxx  (table 1 and fig. 2); this is consistent with
early findings with the same tumor cell lines in vitro (18).
because  xxxd3077xxx  is not highly active in these models, to achieve
higher response rate, it may need to be combined with other
chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action,
such as a topoisomerase i inhibitors ( xxxd2383xxx ),  xxxd2923xxx  (cisplatin, carboplatin), and/or radiotherapy. the study
of antitumor efficacy and role of sequence of  xxxd3077xxx  in combination with  xxxd2383xxx  or cisplatin is under way in this laboratory.
the data presented herein demonstrated that the antitumor
activity and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  was highly schedule-dependent.
single-dose and weekly schedules were more active and less
toxic than the daily schedule (table 1 and fig. 2). higher
toxicity was observed with the daily 3 5 schedule, probably
from rapid drug accumulation and retention in mouse tissues
due to extensive polyglutamylation, resulting in high drug levels
(50 –100-fold higher than plasma) associated with prolonged ts
inhibition in tissues (8). this confirms the argument that frequent dosing schedules with  xxxd3077xxx  may produce unacceptable
toxicity (8). unlike drugs with different mechanisms of action,

the data are combined from two independent experiments with 10 animals for each group.
mpeg-tpase was administered by a single dose at 2500 units/kg 1 h before  xxxd3077xxx .

such as  xxxd2383xxx , with which higher antitumor activity is usually
associated with prolonged drug administration (35),  xxxd3077xxx 
showed higher antitumor efficacy with an infrequent dosing
schedule (single or weekly). a possible explanation is that

 xxxd3077xxx  was rapidly and efficiently polyglutamylated with resultant high intracellular drug levels and more potent, prolonged
inhibition of ts (36). however, other mechanisms must be
involved because the dose difference in mtd is small between

the weekly and the daily schedule (60 versus 30 mg/kg). more
importantly, with the weekly schedule, lower drug doses
(20 – 40 mg/kg) produced higher antitumor activity than the
daily schedule at the mtd (table 1). we hypothesize that host
immune function may be decreased with the daily schedule
because of high toxicity. the mechanism of action of  xxxd3077xxx 
with different schedules should be further investigated. nevertheless, these data demonstrate that current clinical trials with
infrequent administration of  xxxd3077xxx  are appropriate.
it was believed that the high level of plasma  xxxd3364xxx  in mouse
relative to human might affect the toxicity and antitumor activity of ts inhibitors (8, 21). indirect supporting evidence was
that the cytotoxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  was completely reversed by
coincubation with  xxxd3364xxx  in vitro (9, 18, 19) and the toxicity and
antitumor activity of  xxxd3077xxx  can be abrogated by coadministration of  xxxd3364xxx  in vivo (9, 20). we preadministered mpegtpase to reduce plasma  xxxd3364xxx  in the a253 xenograft model, then
treated with various doses of  xxxd3077xxx . the results showed that
mpeg-tpase significantly increased the toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx ,
produced a 3–10-fold dose reduction in mtd with the two
tested schedules (fig. 4; tables 3 and 4). however, mpegtpase did not potentiate the antitumor activity of  xxxd3077xxx 
(tables 3 and 4; figs. 5 and 6). the data indicate that low
plasma  xxxd3364xxx  would profoundly affect toxicity, but has little
effect on the antitumor activity of  xxxd3077xxx . we agree that the
mtd of a ts inhibitor obtained from rodent models should not
to be used to predict a safe dose for clinical phase i study. it is
better to choose other models with low plasma  xxxd3364xxx  level
similar to humans, such as dogs, to determine the clinical
starting dose. however, we believe that rodent models, particularly human tumor xenografts, are still useful models for predicting the outcome of antitumor activity of ts inhibitors and
for schedule selection for clinical trails.
in conclusion, these studies with human hnscc models
show  xxxd3077xxx  was moderately active against human hnscc
xenografts. antitumor efficacy of  xxxd3077xxx  is comparable with
or superior to fura and  xxxd2117xxx , with a better chemotherapeutic
index and safety margin in these model systems. the antitumor
efficacy and toxicity of  xxxd3077xxx  is schedule-dependent. it is less
active and more toxic with frequent daily dosing. the data
provide direct evidence for the rationale of current clinical
studies with  xxxd3077xxx . animal models with high plasma  xxxd3364xxx 
are not the most suitable models for assessment of the toxicity
of and for selecting a safe dose for clinical trial of ts inhibitors.
however, these models are useful for in vivo study of antitumor
activity and schedule selection with ts inhibitors.
