introduction. colchicine is used mainly for the treatment and prevention of gout and for familial mediterranean fever (fmf). it has a narrow
therapeutic index, with no clear-cut distinction between nontoxic, toxic, and lethal doses, causing substantial confusion among clinicians.
although colchicine poisoning is sometimes intentional, unintentional toxicity is common and often associated with a poor outcome. methods.

toxicity is an extension of its mechanism of action – binding to tubulin and disrupting the microtubular network. as a result, affected cells

mitosis, and interrupted cardiac myocyte conduction and contractility. the culmination of these mechanisms leads to multi-organ dysfunction

relatively uncommon, it is imperative to recognize its features as it is associated with a high mortality rate when missed.

colchicine is a neutral lipophilic alkaloid with weak antiinflammatory activity. it is extracted from two plants: colchicum autumnale (autumn crocus, meadow saffron) and gloriosa
superba (glory lily). colchicine has been used for centuries
for the treatment of acute gout and has been approved by the
fda for gout prophylaxis and treatment of familial mediterranean fever (fmf), in which it can reduce the incidence of

the primary complication, systemic amyloidosis.1 colchicine
may also play a role in the treatment of various other conditions such as recurrent pericarditis, scleroderma, behcet’s
syndrome, and sweet’s syndrome but the data are often
limited and inconclusive.2,3
the use of colchicine is limited by its toxicity. it is safe
when administered according to established therapeutic
guidelines in fmf. however, gastrointestinal side effects can
occur before the relief of acute gouty pain even when using
recommended doses.4,5 at excessive doses, colchicine can
cause serious systemic toxicity. acute colchicine poisoning is
uncommon, but is associated with a high mortality rate. it is
essential, therefore, that clinicians recognize and are familiar
with colchicine poisoning.
the objective of this article is to review colchicine poisoning, as early diagnosis and treatment can favorably influence
the prognosis of this potentially fatal intoxication.

additionally, drugs such as clarithromycin and ciclosporin
which inhibit p-glycoprotein ( xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx ), an integral membrane
atpase efflux pump encoded on the  xxxg10xxx  ( xxxg10xxx ) gene,
can also potentiate colchicine toxicity. inhibition of  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx 
induces both increased gastrointestinal absorption and
decreased efflux (e.g., from hepatocytes) leading to increased
serum and intracellular colchicine concentrations. the high
intracellular concentration results in greater tubulin inhibition
and enhanced toxicity.20,21
the mean elimination half-life of oral colchicine is 4.4–16 h
in therapeutic doses and may reach 11–32 h in poisoned
patients.7,12 colchicine can be detected in leukocytes and in
the urine for at least 9 days following a single intravenous
(iv) dose.22 its half-life in leukocytes is reported to be 60 h.23
according to postmortem tissue analyses, colchicine accumulates at high concentrations in bone marrow, testicles,
spleen, kidney, heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract, lung,
and brain.7

methods
therapeutic and toxic doses
we performed a systematic review by searching ovid
medline between 1966 and january 2010. our search
strategy included “colchicine” and “poisoning” or “overdose” or “toxicity” or “intoxication.” this search identified
194 papers. this list was manually screened for papers relating to colchicine poisoning in humans, the mechanism of toxicity, or its clinical management. seventy-six papers were
identified as meeting the search criteria. reference lists of
identified papers were also manually screened for additional
references (identifying an additional 32). nonpeer-reviewed
sources were also searched and four were included.

toxicokinetics
colchicine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
serum concentrations peak at 0.5–3.0 h after ingestion.6
absorption is not significantly delayed even following an
overdose.7 the drug undergoes extensive hepatic first-pass
metabolism, which accounts for its relatively low systemic
bioavailability, 25–50%.8–10 after absorption, colchicine is
rapidly distributed to all tissues, where it binds to intracellular
elements. in therapeutic doses, its protein binding is 10–50%
and volume of distribution ranges between 2 and 12 l/kg11,12
but reaches up to 21 l/kg in overdose.7 colchicine is eliminated
primarily by hepatic metabolism by the cyp 3a4 isoform
of cytochrome p450, which involves deacetylation and
demethylation, followed by biliary excretion.13,14 colchicine
and its metabolites undergo significant enterohepatic
re-circulation.11,15–17 the kidneys have an important role in
the clearance of colchicine, and the drug’s clearance is significantly reduced in patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency.
patients with impaired renal or hepatic function are
at higher risk for toxicity and need to be closely monitored
even while receiving conventional dose regimens.11,12,18,19

there are several dosing regimens for fmf and acute gout
and treatment prophylaxis. typical oral recommended doses
of colchicine for fmf range between 1.2 and 2.4 mg/day,
whereas the recommended dose for acute gout is 1.2 mg followed by a single dose of 0.6 mg at the first sign of flare, and
for gout prophylaxis 0.5–0.6 mg/day three to four times a
week.23 in children with fmf, the dosage should be adjusted
to body weight and ranges from 0.3 to 1.8 mg/day in children
between 4 and 6 years and 0.9 to 1.8 mg/day in children
between 6 and 12 years (older children are administered adult
doses) and may be increased up to 2 mg/day if attacks are not
controlled.24 tablets contain colchicine 0.6 or 1.0 mg,23 and
an iv solution (0.5 mg/ml) is also available in some countries.
iv colchicine is occasionally administered when a rapid
response is desired or the oral route is precluded; however,
the fda recently withdrew marketing approval for iv
preparations.25 the risk of severe systemic poisoning with
iv administration of the drug is significantly increased, partly
because of lack of early gastrointestinal symptoms.26–28 if iv
colchicine is given as a substitute for the oral form, it should
not exceed 50% of the oral dose because of lack of first-pass
effect.26 toxicity in these cases depends on the total cumulative dose given in a course, which should not exceed 2–4 mg
in adults; no colchicine (by any route) should be given for
7 days thereafter.27 the failure to follow these guidelines
(with doses of 5.5–19 mg being administered) led to severe
poisoning and death at 1–40 days after iv drug administration
in 20 adults between 1983 and 2000.27 the dose should be
avoided or significantly reduced in patients with kidney failure.
in general, the risk of colchicine poisoning is dose-dependent.
however, the drug has a low therapeutic index, and there is
overlap between therapeutic and toxic doses and a high fatality rate when ingestion exceeds 0.5 mg/kg in acute cases.29,30
gastrointestinal and coagulation disorders were reported in

colchicine poisoning
doses less than 0.5 mg/kg, bone marrow aplasia and a 10%
mortality rate in patients ingesting 0.5–0.8 mg/kg, and death
in doses exceeding 0.8 mg/kg in acute ingestions.29 colchicine exhibits a great variation in the dose required to cause
significant morbidity or mortality. there is no clear-cut line
between nontoxic, toxic, and lethal doses of colchicine in
either adults or children.
the lowest reported lethal doses of oral colchicine have
ranged from 7 to 26 mg.31–35 fatalities have also been
reported following iv injection of 18 mg over 11 days, 10 mg
over 5 days, and 8 mg over 3 days.28,36,37 in contrast, adult
patients survived acute ingestions of up to 60 mg.38 the
youngest patient with a fatal colchicine overdose was
reported as 12 months old.39 however, each of these is a case
report, and the generalizability of observations is limited.
of interest is a 1966 report describing the survival of a
patient after an alleged “ingestion of 350 mg of colchicine,”40
which has been repeatedly quoted in the medical literature
over the past 40 years.41–43 this report was of a young
woman who ingested boiled tubers of g. superba, developed
colchicine poisoning, and fully recovered. we believe the
authors overestimated the amount of colchicine in the tubers.
survival after ingestion of colchicine 350 mg is inconceivable
in view of the minimal lethal oral doses reported (7–26 mg)31–35
and the maximal reported tolerated dose of 60 mg.38 misquotation of this overestimation can result in reduced alertness to
much lower but still life-threatening colchicine overdose.

drug interactions
interactions between colchicine and drugs or compounds that
inhibit cyp 3a4 can potentially lead to increased serum and
tissue colchicine concentrations and toxicity. the main
specific inhibitors of cyp 3a4 known to interact with colchicine are clarithromycin, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and
natural grapefruit juice, although multiple other inhibitors
may interact with the drug.41,44–47  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  inhibitors reported to
interact with colchicine include clarithromycin44,46,48 and
ciclosporin.49–51 concurrent use of  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  or strong cyp 3a4
inhibitors with colchicine is contraindicated in patients with
hepatic or renal impairment23 and a dose reduction or interruption of colchicine therapy should be considered in patients
taking those inhibitors who have no renal or hepatic impairment. concomitant administration of colchicine and statins
(i.e., fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin) resulted in
myopathy.52–54 the mechanism for this interaction has not
been fully elucidated but may involve disruption of the
cytoskeleton by both the statin and colchicine.52

mechanisms of toxicity
colchicine binds to the intracellular protein tubulin, preventing
its alpha and beta forms from polymerizing to form microtubules. this disruption of the microtubular network results in

409
impaired protein assembly in the golgi apparatus, decreased
endocytosis and exocytosis, altered cell shape, depressed
cellular motility, and arrest of mitosis. in toxic doses, colchicine arrests mitosis in metaphase because chromosome separation depends on microtubular function,16,55 thus inhibiting cell
division. these effects occur in all cell lines of the body and
explain both the therapeutic effects and the multi-organ toxicity seen with poisonings. the systems with the highest turnover rate, that is, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and hair
follicles, are the most vulnerable and most readily affected.56,57
disruption of the microtubular network also leads to
decreased expression of adhesion molecules on neutrophil
membranes and modulates cytokine production.58 colchicine
may also have a direct toxic action on myocardial cells. this
effect may be related to binding of the drug to microtubules in
myocytes, which interferes with cardiac conduction and contractility.59–63 the inhibition of other important microtubular
functions such as cytoplasmic motility and extracellular secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters may be involved in
the devastating processes leading to multi-organ failure in
cases of drug overdose.64 colchicine also inhibits the release
of histamine from mast cells, inhibits the secretion of insulin
from the pancreas, depresses central respiratory centers,
induces hypertension by central vasomotor stimulation, and
enhances the patient’s response to sympathomimetic agents.65
recent studies have focused on the role of  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  in colchicine poisoning because this transporter is an efflux protein.66
the paucity of  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression in neutrophils, together with
the threefold greater concentration of colchicine detected in
neutrophils compared to lymphocytes, may explain the mechanism of action of colchicine.58 this also suggests that  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx 
is an important factor in colchicine toxicity and can partly
explain neutropenia and bone marrow suppression.

reproductive toxicology and lactation
sperm motility, which depends on microtubular function,
may theoretically be reduced by colchicine. however, in vitro
studies showed that the serum concentration required to
impair sperm motility is 3,000 times higher than the concentration achieved with therapeutic dosing.67 the reported frequency of oligospermia in adult patients treated with
colchicine ranges widely, from 0% to 37%, depending on the
series and the underlying disease.16,24,68,69 recent data suggest that this effect is rare.70 there is no convincing evidence
of a negative effect of colchicine treatment on female fertility. in fact, by controlling attacks in pregnant women with
fmf, colchicine may reduce peritoneal adhesions and
mechanical infertility.70
small amounts of colchicine were found in cord blood samples, suggesting that it may cross the human placenta.71 several
case series have not demonstrated any effect on birth weight,
duration of pregnancy, miscarriage rate, or congenital malformations.70,72–75 furthermore, in 548 pregnant women treated
chronically with colchicine for fmf, the rate of birth defects

and chromosomal abnormalities were consistent with the
general population.76 this large study suggests that the small
number of case reports linking colchicine to down syndrome
may simply reflect chance alone.65,74,77 most current policies
recommend continuous colchicine therapy during pregnancy
with amniocentesis performed in the fourth to fifth month.76,78
colchicine is present in breast milk and can bind to fatty
acids and proteins.79–81 concentrations in milk have a parallel
time–concentration curve to that of plasma.81 the estimated
daily amount of colchicine ingested by the nursing infant is
less than one-tenth the therapeutic dose (per kilogram).16
this finding, together with the favorable outcome of more
than 50 infants breast fed by colchicine-treated mothers, have
led to many authors recommending continued breast-feeding
in this scenario.16 the american academy of pediatrics categorizes colchicine as compatible with breast-feeding.82
the potential effect of colchicine on childhood growth is
also of concern, as growth requires cell division. however,
one study found that growth was within the normal percentiles
even in children treated with colchicine (0.5–1 mg/day) for
long periods.24 further evaluation of this cohort demonstrated that their development and fertility were also normal.

clinical features
patients ingesting therapeutic oral doses of colchicine may suffer from abdominal pain, cramping, hyperperistalsis, diarrhea,

nausea, and vomiting.23,44 gastrointestinal manifestations
develop frequently and may precede pain relief in up to 91%
of patients, limiting enthusiasm for the drug generally, and
limiting its dose in many patients.5 the suggestion to administer colchicine at frequent intervals until gastrointestinal side
effects develop is a matter of significant concern4 and has led
to unintentional death in our experience.
the clinical course of acute colchicine poisoning is well
described (table 1). it may be divided into three sequential
and usually overlapping phases.16,64 the first (gastrointestinal)
phase reflects gastrointestinal mucosal damage and a choleralike syndrome may develop.33,35,64,83–88 gastrointestinal
symptoms may be limited when toxicity follows iv administration.26–28 the second (multi-organ) phase is characterized
by multi-organ dysfunction and metabolic derangements are
also common.17,35,44,56,64,84,89,90 death from acute colchicine
poisoning is usually due to hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrhythmias (typically 24–36 h after ingestion or could
be sudden) or from infectious or hemorrhagic complications.17,91–96 patients with early hemodynamic collapse have
a particularly poor prognosis.91 surviving patients will enter
the third phase, which is characterized by recovery of bone
marrow depression with rebound leukocytosis, resolution of
organ failure, and can be followed by complete recovery.30,37,44,97 myopathy, neuropathy, and combined myoneuropathy have all been reported after acute poisoning.

areflexia, and nerve conduction impairment compatible with

colchicine poisoning
axonal neuropathy are characteristics.42,64,90,98,99 other complications include delirium, stupor and coma, convulsions,
adrenal hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, alopecia, and pancreatitis.29,30,41,42,90,99–101 although
rare, a toxic epidermal necrolysis-like reaction has also been
reported, with histopathology showing subepidermal bullae
and apoptosis of keratinocytes.34
similar to the third phase of acute poisoning described
above, chronic colchicine toxicity includes neuromyopathy and
myocardial failure. the neuromyopathy presents with proximal
weakness and can also include respiratory insufficiency.102 an
increase in serum creatine kinase activity is invariably
observed. these features should reverse in 3–4 weeks after discontinuation of colchicine.102 the presence of myocardial failure offers a dismal prognosis.93 chronic toxicity is thought to be
rare because development of gastrointestinal symptoms usually
leads to stopping treatment.93 chronic toxicity is often associated with renal impairment or precipitated by an inter-current
illness and is usually misdiagnosed as polymyositis or uremic
neuropathy.35,98,102 the best predictor for myotoxicity from
colchicine was found to be impaired renal function, with a creatinine clearance of 50 ml/min or less.103

diagnosis
colchicine poisoning constitutes a toxicological emergency
and requires rapid intervention. the diagnosis of colchicine
poisoning is not difficult if a history of ingestion or parenteral
administration is available. colchicine can also be unintentionally consumed in meals in the form of the leaves of c. autumnale and the tubers of g. superba as they can be mistaken for
wild garlic and sweet potatoes, respectively.30,84,85,104,105 in
regions where fmf is endemic and colchicine use is common,
physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, because
symptoms of colchicine may be misdiagnosed for other systemic diseases (e.g., enterocolitis). a diagnosis of colchicine
poisoning should be investigated when a patient presents with
the typical colchicine toxidrome (gastroenteritis, hypotension,
lactic acidosis, and prerenal azotemia).47 differentiation of
colchicine poisoning from enterocolitis, sepsis, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug or iron poisoning (in the early phase),
or heavy metal poisoning (in the later phase) is possible by the
presence of severe bone marrow suppression in the second
phase and proper infectious and relevant toxicological evaluations. under-diagnosis may partly explain the small number of
reported cases of colchicine poisoning.
any patient with a known or suspected colchicine overdose should be admitted for observation for 24 h and managed as an inpatient.30 early gastrointestinal manifestations
should be sought. if no symptoms and signs develop within
the first 24 h after ingestion they are unlikely to appear later,
and the patient may be discharged. in cases of iv colchicine
overdose, gastrointestinal signs are lacking, and a higher
index of suspicion and longer observation period (a few days)
are needed. if clinical signs of poisoning develop, close mon-

411
itoring in an intensive care unit is required, anticipating the
above-mentioned complications.

laboratory studies
baseline laboratory studies for a patient presenting with
colchicine poisoning include complete blood count, glucose,
electrolytes, renal and hepatic function tests, coagulation
tests, creatine kinase, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, arterial blood gases, chest x-ray, urinalysis, and continuous ecg
monitoring.17,33,41,47,106,107 troponin, fibrinogen, fibrinogen
split products, and echocardiography should be considered
depending upon the clinical picture.56,84,87,89,96,106 a pregnancy test is recommended in females. in the presence of
organ dysfunction, a hematology blood smear displaying
toxic vacuolation, gross dysplasia, and nuclear karyorrhexis
should alert clinicians to possible colchicine poisoning.35
laboratory parameters should be serially monitored to detect
possible delayed toxicity. colchicine plasma concentrations
may be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,
hplc, and radioimmunoassay. however, they are neither
readily available in the clinical setting, nor useful for the
management of acute poisoning because there is no established correlation to severity of illness.95,106,107

management
the mainstays of treatment consist of prompt recognition of
colchicine poisoning, with, if possible, determination of the
dose ingested or administered, early gastrointestinal decontamination, and aggressive supportive care. management
may be difficult if multi-organ failure develops.
in early (i.e., 1–2 h after ingestion) presentations of large
ingestions, efforts to remove any remaining colchicine from the
gastrointestinal tract by gastric lavage followed by activated
charcoal should be attempted.90 large amounts of the drug have
been found in the stomach 24 h after ingestion,83 thus the use of
activated charcoal may be considered even in late presentation.
enhanced elimination with multi-dose activated charcoal
(mdac) should be considered because of colchicine’s
enterohepatic re-circulation17 and in cases of ingestion of
colchicine-containing plants.84 although the efficacy of mdac
in managing colchicine poisoning has not been systematically
studied, its use should be considered in patients with potentially
serious or lethal ingestions. in case of vomiting, anti-emetics
can be given to control emesis and facilitate activated charcoal
administration. paralytic ileus, which can develop as a complication of colchicine poisoning, may complicate the use of
mdac.84,90 extracorporeal elimination (e.g., hemodialysis and
hemoperfusion) is ineffective mainly because of the large volume of distribution of colchicine.99,108
after decontamination, treatment is mainly supportive.30
sudden malignant arrhythmias and death have been reported
in colchicine poisoning, and symptomatic patients or those

412
with confirmed ingested toxic doses should be monitored in
an intensive care unit. continuous monitoring of vital signs,
ecg, and serial hematological and biochemical assessments
is warranted. treatment includes judicious administration of
iv fluids, correction of electrolyte and acid–base balance,
vasopressor drugs, antiarrhythmics, blood products, and
mechanical ventilation.30 broad-spectrum antibiotics should
also be given if a secondary infection is suspected or the
patient is febrile.47 granulocyte  xxxg526xxx 
should be considered if there is leukopenia and is thought to
accelerate production of neutrophils within the bone marrow
and prevent development of septicemia.47,109
effective experimental treatment with colchicine-specific
fab fragment antibodies was reported in a single adult patient
with severe colchicine poisoning.38 positive hemodynamic
effects were quickly noted, although bone marrow suppression did not significantly improve. ultimately, the patient
survived a large (60 mg) overdose. colchicine-specific fab
fragments consist of the light chain and variable region of the
heavy chain of antibodies derived from goats immunized
with a conjugate of colchicine and  xxxg124xxx .110 in vitro
studies have shown that colchicine-specific antibodies restore
the activity of tubulin inhibited by colchicine.111 their mechanism of action in the clinical setting is similar to that of
digoxin-specific fab fragment antibodies; both bind to the
target drug allowing its redistribution into the extracellular
space and intravascular compartment, and thus the removal
of substantial amounts from peripheral tissues.33,111,112 the
high affinity of the fab fragment antibodies to colchicine
prevents the drug from binding to other peripheral sites.
presently, this treatment is not commercially available.

conclusions
colchicine poisoning is relatively uncommon, but potentially
severe, and has a high mortality rate. it may easily be overlooked
because presenting gastrointestinal manifestations may resemble
other systemic diseases. aggressive supportive treatment,
including granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  when appropriate, is required to manage colchicine’s toxic effects. specific
therapy with fab fragment antibodies seems to be effective but,
unfortunately, is not commercially available at present.
