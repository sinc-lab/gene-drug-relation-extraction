abstract
the effects of a topically applied corticosteroid, budesonide,
on the expression of  xxxg1601xxx  (cr) mrna and
regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine patterns in patients
with nasal polyps were evaluated. all patients were eligible for
surgical polypectomy, and a majority of them had been treated
with nasal steroids. patients were given 400 p.,gb.i.d. (group a,
n = 11), 200 p.,g b.i.d. (group b, n = 10), or no treatment
(group c, n = 15) during two months before polypectomy.
morning serum cortisol was analyzed on the day of surgery.
surgically removed polyps were taken for analysis of gr
mrna expression by solution hybridization. remaining tissue
was cryostat-sectioned, whereafter quantification of the cytokines interleukin i {3,  xxxg1173xxx , interleukin 4,  xxxg1180xxx ,
 xxxg1181xxx ,  xxxg1161xxx ,  xxxg2296xxx  0:, and
interferon 'y was made by immunohistochemistry and digitized
image analysis. no significant differences among the three
groups were found for any of the parameters investigated.
conclusion: nasal polyps do not respond with down-regulation

a

dministration of systemically or topically applied corticosteroids (nasal spray or powder) is an established
form of treatment in allergic rhinitis and for prevention of
recurrences after surgical removal of nasal polyps. topical
corticosteroids may also reduce the size of nasal polyps
without prior surgery and have been suggested as first-line
treatment (see ref. 28), although therapy traditions may
vary considerably among different countries. in one study,
-80% of all patients achieved a total or substantial effect on
polyp size and symptoms.l why the remaining 20% responded poorly is not known. presently it is not possible to
predict the result of such treatment in the individual patient.
the glucocorticoid response requires binding of the steroid molecule to a specific intracellular  xxxg1601xxx  (gr). the steroid-receptor complex is translocated
into the nucleus where it binds to the promoter region of
specific genes, thus positively or negatively regulating gene
transcription. in most cells the gr gene itself is negatively
regulated by glucocorticoids, subsequently leading to a reduction of mrna and corresponding receptor protein levels. the concentration of gr varies among different cells
and tissues2 and there may be interindividual differences
concerning regulation of or in one type of tissue.2-4 dif-

ferences may also exist in the interaction of gr with various
transcription factors, such as the abnormal interaction between gr and the activating protein- i (ap-i) in steroidresistant asthma.s finally, eosinophils primed by cultured
epithelial cell supernatant from nasal polyps display reduced sensitivity to glucocorticosteroids,6 further indicating
the complex nature of glucocorticoid effects in different
types of tissue.
rather than being the manifestation of one isolated disease, nasal polyps are the end result of several different
pathological conditions that may share a common pathway,
such as bronchial asthma with aspirin intolerance, cystic
fibrosis, and chronic sinusitis. thus, the underlying mechanisms in polyp formation should be sought in the microinflammatory environment and in the local cell-to-cell interactions,7 which may be reflected by the local pattern of
cytokine expression in the tissue. the combined effects of
cytokines and growth factors produced by infiltrating t
cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, or circulating cells, the
latter being primarily eosinophils, may influence the process of polyp formation and growth at various levels. the
concentrations of certain cytokines, e.g.,  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf),  xxxg1173xxx 
(il-2),  xxxg1177xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx ), and  xxxg1180xxx  ( xxxg1180xxx ) appear
to be increased in nasal polyps compared to normal nasal
mucosa. additional differences exist between patients with
or without sinusitis.8
the beneficial effect of glucocorticosteroids on nasal
polyps may be the result of a complex cytokine regulation.
important mechanisms may include a direct transcriptional
inhibition mediated by the activation of ap-l or nuclear
factor kb ( xxxg1559xxx ), or by induction of cytoplasmic inhibitors of these transcription factors.9
the aim of this study was to evaluate possible regulatory
effects of a topically applied corticosteroid, budesonide, on
the expression of gr mrna and pro-inflammatory cytokine patterns in nasal polyp tissue.

study design

p

atients were re-examined one day before the planned
operation, and it was decided whether a surgical procedure was still indicated. at the time of surgery, polyps
were removed with snare or forceps, snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored in a -70°c freezer until analysis. a
note was made of whether the polyp had been located
frontally or posterior to the ostium of the maxillary sinus.
part of the frozen tissue was processed for analysis of gr
mrna expression levels while the remainder was cryosectioned and immunohistochemically
stained for identification of the following cytokines: interleukin 1{3(il-l (3),
 xxxg1173xxx  (il-2),  xxxg1177xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx ), interleukin 4 ( xxxd3054xxx ), tnf a, and ifn 'y. due to insufficient available tissue,
cytokine immunohistochemistry was only carried out in part
of the material (group a: n = 7, group b: n = 9, group c:
n = 9). see table i for details.
three patients were excluded from the study: one patient
treated with budesonide had improved so much that a surgical procedure was no longer indicated and the second
subject was later found to be suffering from inverted papilloma, and not polyposis. finally, the third patient was
excluded from surgery because hepatitis c was unexpectedly diagnosed after the first examination.
serum cortisol

o

n the day of surgery, fasting blood samples were
obtained at 08:00 a.m. for serum cortisol analysis.
serum cortisol was determined by a solid-phase 1251_ria
(coat-a-count cortisol, diagnostic products corp., los
angeles, ca). patients regularly using inhalation steroids (2
in group a, 3 in group b, 2 in group c) because of asthma
were excluded from this part of the study because the
objective was to evaluate the effect of nasally applied
budesonide on serum cortisol levels.

and methods

hitty-nine patients with clinically diagnosed nasal polyposis participated in this investigation. although a
majority had used nasal corticosteroids earlier, or were still
doing so, all patients were eligible for surgical polypectomy
(table i). patients with endocrinological disorders or severe
systemic disease, and those using systemic corticosteroids,
were not included. at the initial visit a diagnosis was
established and patients randomized to one of the following
groups: (a) topical treatment with  xxxd379xxx  spray
( xxxd379xxx  aqua) 400 /-lg b.i.d. for two months before
surgery (n = i i); (b) topical treatment with budesonide
nasal spray ( xxxd379xxx  aqua) 200 /-lgb.i.d. for two months
before surgery (n = 10); and (c) no treatment with nasal
corticosteroids until time of surgery, minimum two months
(n = is).
this investigation was approved by the human ethics
committee of the karolinska institute, huddinge university

he sections were studied using an olympus bx/50 light
microscope. microscope images were captured with
an s-vhs camera and digitized with rasterops 24 xl tv
board (rasterops corp., santa clara, ca) and a personal
computer. this set-up gives high-resolution 24-bit rgb true
color digital images with defined values from zero to 255 on an
arbitrary scale for each channel. using the 40x lens, 10 microscopic fields were randomly sampled from each section.
the positively stained areas in the sections were measured
semiautomatically using a scripted subroutine in the ip lab
spectrum software (signal analytics corp., vienna, va) for
digital image analysis in the following manner: the script
initially splits the image into the three color coordinates, viz.
red, green, and blue. the values from the blue channel are
subtracted by image arithmetic from those of the red channel.
the resulting values, seen as white in the yielding black-andwhite image, correspond to the area stained red in the color
image. this area is then measured by segmentation with arbitrary threshold values. real length and area are calculated by
importing calibration data from earlier captured images of
known distances. finally, the segmentation for each section is
pasted as an overlay onto the original color image for feasible
visual control; i.e., thresholds chosen correspond to the positively stained areas in the color image. when needed, the
thresholds were adjusted and the analysis was rerun until good
correspondence was obtained. the results were expressed as
area ratio; i.e., the mean sum of the surface stained positively
for each cytokine is divided by the respective total section area.
solution hybridization

a

analysis

fter homogenization, nasal polyp sample rna was
extracted using a modified guanidine thiocyanate water-saturated phenol/chloroform extraction method according to chomczynski and sacchi.12 the quantity and purity
of rna were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 260/280 nm. the absorbance 260/
280 ratio exceeded 1.8 in all samples.
for construction of the human gr probe a complementary oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 150-209
in the human gr sequence was synthesized and ligated into
the pstl/hindill sites in the pgem tmi vector. the sequence of this insert was confirmed by dna sequencing
using the di-deoxy chain termination method. vectors and
reagents required for in vitro synthesis of crna and mrna
using the sp6/t7 riboprobe system were obtained from
promega biotech (madison, wi).
for solution hybridization, rna samples were hybridized to -20,000 counts per minute (cpm) 35s-labeled crane
probes in 40 p,l of 0.6 m nalco, 20 mm tris-hci, ph 7.5,

2 mm edt a, and 100 p,g/ml denatured salmon sperm
dna. after hybridization, 40 p,g  xxxg1963xxx  and 5.9 x 105 u
rnase ti were added. digestion was performed at 37°,
after which rnase-resistant rna was precipitated with 100
j.llof 6 m cci3cooh. precipitates were collected for
scintillation counting by filtration on whatman gf/c filters
(whatman inc., clifton, nj).13
the amount of gr mrna in each sample was calculated
from a linear standard curve constructed from incubations
with known amounts of in vitro synthesized mrna, complementary to the 35s-labeled probe. a standard curve (5~
3000 x 10-18 mol mrnaiincubation) was included in all
assays, and each rna sample mrna was calculated from
the linear part of the respective standard curve. results are
expressed as attomoles (amol) mrna/p,g rna calculated
from the standard curve and spectrophotometric measurements. rnase-resistant counts per minute were <3% of
input counts per minute.

cytokine immunoreactivity

cells at variable frequencies in all specimens. cytokine-producing cells were found mainly in the epithelium,
glandular tubules, and acini, as well as infiltrating cells in
the stroma. the localization of the immunoreactive areas for
each of the different cytokines showed only marginal variations. the intensity of the immunoreactive staining differed considerably for the various cytokines, being strongest
for il-4 and weakest for il-io (fig. i, a and b). quantitative image analysis could not demonstrate any significant
differences regarding the degree of immunoreactivity
among the patient groups for any of the eight cytokines

discussion

t

he intent of this study was not to describe the already
known beneficial effects of topical and systemic steroids on nasal polyposis, but to examine the nature of the
polyp tissue remaining after a course of treatment with a
topically applied corticosteroid. it should be kept in mind
that a majority of the patients had already been treated with
nasal corticosteroids for various periods before inclusion.
we found no significant differences regarding or
mrna levels, infiltration of eosinophils, or local expression
of several cytokines when nasal polyps from patients treated
with topically applied budesonide were compared with polyps taken from untreated patients. furthermore, no differences regarding serum cortisol levels, indicating a systemic
effect of the nasal steroid, were found.

the effect of corticosteroids on gr regulation and cytokines in nasal polyps in vivo has not been investigated
previously. in related studies, topical corticosteroid treatment reduced gr mrna levels in nasal mucosa and in
peripheral blood lymphocytes in healthy volunteers4 or was
associated with down-regulation of il-4 in nasal lavage
from patients with seasonal rhinitis.i4 in addition, budesonide inhibited the ability of nasal polyp epithelium to
produce gm-csf and to promote eosinophil survival in
vitro. is however, budesonide had little effect on the production of il-i {3 and il-6 by alveolar macrophages in

studies are limited. ligand-induced down-regulation of steroid hormone receptors probably represents a feedback
mechanism, which limits the duration of steroid hormone
action in a specific cell or tissue. this complex process
affects transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels and remains to be fully elucidated. gr autoregulation involves changes in receptor degradation, synthesis, and activation. because it represents a potential
feedback mechanism, it is tempting to postulate that the
degree of gr down-regulation is an indicator of the cellular
sensitivity to glucocorticosteroids. in simple terms, a tissue
response to corticosteroid treatment should normally be
associated with down-regulation of gr.
the clinical effect of glucocorticosteroids is undisputed
and may be exerted at several levels: direct or indirect
transcription regulation of certain target genes, inhibition of
cytokines, and interaction with transcription and nuclear
factors that mediate the inflammatory effects of cytokines.
corticosteroids inhibit the activation of t lymphocytes and
thereby the recruitment or survival of other inflammatory
cells, such as eosinophils and mast cells. in addition, migration of key inflammatory cells is indirectly reduced
through inhibition of vascular cell adhesion molecules
(vcam). in the airways, gr gene expression is most
prominent in vascular endothelial cells and airway epithelial
cells.9 corticosteroids probably inhibit microvascular leakage at the postcapillary level by a negative effect on mediators from inflammatory cells or the endothelial cell wall. in
addition, corticosteroids affect epithelial cells by inhibiting
the transcription of several proinflammatory genes. finally,
glucocorticosteroids may affect connective tissue remodeling actions by inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation and
differentiation in nasal polyps.17 taken together, these effects could counteract the characteristic edema and excessive epithelial growth in nasal polyps.
theoretically, cytokine-mediated effects could contribute

to polyp pathogenesis in two principally different ways: a)
by stimulation of local tissue growth, which has been demonstrated for transgenic growth factor a and {3(tgf a and
(3),7 platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf),17 and insulinlike growth factor i (igf-l);18 or b) by maintaining a
permanent inflammatory state with a resulting edema,
which applies to the cytokines analyzed in the present study.
il-l {3is an immunoregulatory protein secreted by activated
monocytes, natural killer (nk) cells, keratinocytes, and
fibroblasts. it modulates activities oft- and b-lymphocytes,
increases neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and phagocytosis, and has been suggested to contribute to chronic inflammatory changes associated with nasal polyps.7 il-2 is critical for normal immune responsiveness and has a profound
influence on the development, expansion, and activation of
t, nk, and b cells.19
il-4 is produced by structural polyp tissue cells and by
infiltrating eosinophils.20 this cytokine is essential for ige
production in allergic conditions. because allergy or atopy
are no longer considered to be principal reasons for formation of nasal polyps, the presence of il-4 in polyp tissue
may appear paradoxical. in the present study, the immunoexpression of il-4 was slightly but not significantly lower
in polyps from patients given budesonide.  xxxg1180xxx  is produced
by eosinophils and enhances survival and activation of the
same cells in an autocrine fashion,21 a mechanism that has
been suggested to inhibit the programmed death (apoptosis)
of eosinophilic cells. il-6 is a multifunctional, proinflammatory cytokine secreted by t cells, macrophages, and
eosinophils. it has the capacity to potentiate il-4-induced
ige synthesis by b cells22 and is central for the immune
response, the acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis.23
il-io has a major role in the regulation of immune response
because it is an inhibitor of macrophage and t and nk cell
effector functions, and blocks activation of cytokine synthesis. in addition, il-io increases b cell proliferation together with il-4. ifn l' is produced by t cells that accumulate in nasal polyps.
the ifn l' iil-4 ratio is high, indicating a th 1 subtype
profile. the reason is unknown because there is little evidence for an antigen-driven process in polyp formation.
tnf a is a multifunctional cytokine with a broad array of
proinflammatory effects. it stimulates most stromal cells to
release various other cytokines and enhances adhesion of
granulocytes to blood vessels and transendothelial migration. tnf a may promote eosinophil cytotoxic function and
could contribute to the epithelial damage noted in nasal
polyps.7
computerized image analysis was chosen for cytokine
analysis in the present study. this method has been used for
evaluation in other immunohistochemical studies,24 and in
our opinion it is more objective than semiquantification,
which in the present case would have been the alternative.
there may be several reasons for a poor response to local
glucocorticosteroid treatment in nasal polyposis. an inability of the drug to reach target cells in large edematous

polyps could possibly explain a reduced effect on gr.
proliferati~g and relatively undifferentiated cells are conspicuous in developing polyps. because such cells tend to
be less responsive to glucocorticosteroids,5 this could be
another reason for treatment failure. induction of a multidrug resistance gene protein (p-glycoprotein) results in resistance to dexamethasone in murine thymoma cells.25 similar mechanisms could explain the relative insensitivity to
corticosteroids in the present study, especially when it is
considered that the majority of the patients had received
such treatment previously. in atopic asthma patients, a relative glucocorticoid insensitivity after allergen exposure
may be explained by il-2- and il-4-mediated changes in
gr-binding affinity26 and similar mechanisms may apply in
cases of steroid-resistant nasal polyposis. finally, different
polyp populations with varying glucocorticoid sensitivity
may be present in an individual patient. for obvious reasons, glucocorticoid-sensitive polyps are difficult to obtain
for analysis. it is not possible to determine the clinical
sensitivity before sampling and these polyps will disappear
during treatment.
nasal polyps represent a type of pathological tissue that
in many respects is not directly comparable to normal nasal
mucosa. the number of eosinophils in nasal polyps is
greater than in normal nasal mucosa, and the epithelial cell
proliferation in nasal polyps is significantly higher than in
inferior turbinate mucosa from the same patient.27 nasal
epithelium increases the survival of co-culture eosinophils
in vitro, and this effect is even more pronounced for epithelium derived from nasal polyps. the increased eosinophil survival can be blocked by simultaneous incubation
with corticosteroids, although nasal polyp epithelium is
more resistant to such treatment.6 these facts may help to
explain why there was no difference in eosinophilic infiltration between treated and untreated patients in our study.
gr down-regulation occurs in normal nasal mucosa after
topical corticosteroid treatment, as demonstrated by knutsson et al.,3 but apparently not in the remaining nasal polyps,
as shown in the present study. this difference in response
may also be attributed to factors inherent in polyp tissue.
the difference in effect of corticoids on nasal mucosa and
nasal polyps may simply be one of access to tissue cells.
finally, it should be emphasized that the objective of the
present study was not to evaluate the clinical response of the
patients. thus, this investigation does not rule out that some,
or even all, patients given the corticosteroid spray may be
improved in terms of reduced polyp size and increased nasal
breathing. some polyps could even have disappeared completely. surgery was considered as still indicated at the
second visit in all cases except one, however.
in conclusion, the lack of reduction in gr mrna and
local pro-inflammatory cytokines after long-term exposure
to relatively high concentrations of an intra-nasal steroid
may be indicative of an inherent reduction in steroid responsiveness ("steroid resistance") in nasal polyps. this may be
of clinical relevance because even high doses of locally

applied corticosteroids will have little or no effect in a
certain proportion of all polyp patients. however, systemically administered corticosteroids may well affect the regulation of gr and cytokines also in this particular group of
patients. the relati ve resistance to topical treatment may, at
least in part, be explained by an insufficient penetration of
the active substance through the mucosa to the target cells.
future analyses of the clinical and gr autoregulatory
response to corticosteroids in polyp tissue could make it
possible to tailor dosage to the individual patient and to
refer corticosteroid-resistant
individuals for surgery at an
early stage. another important task will be to document and
clarify the correlation, or in the case of gr resistance, the
lack of it, between clinical improvement and the effect on
cytokines and gr regulation in polyp tissue remaining after
local and/or systemic corticosteroid treatment.
