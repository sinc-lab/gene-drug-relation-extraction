abstract
tumor cells respond to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of genes involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and
angiogenesis, all essential to maintaining nutrient availability and intracellular atp levels.  xxxd81xxx -dependent kinase (ampk) is a key sensor for cellular homeostasis and is highly sensitive to changes in amp:
atp ratios. the two catalytic ampk alpha isoforms ( xxxg1830xxx ,
ampka2) were investigated with respect to their expression, cellular distribution, and contribution to vegf
expression under hypoxic stress in human u373 glioblastoma cells. quantitative real-time pcr analysis showed
 xxxg1830xxx  mrna to be constitutively expressed in normoxia
and hypoxia, whereas ampka2 mrna levels were low in
normoxia and signiﬁcantly induced in hypoxia. fluorescent
immunohistochemistry showed that ampka2 protein redistributed to the nucleus under hypoxia, whereas  xxxg1830xxx 
remained distributed throughout the cell. the ampk chemical inhibitor,  xxxd2378xxx , effectively repressed the
hypoxic induction of vegf mrna levels and hypoxia inducible factor-1 dependent transcription. ampka2 repression with rna interference reduced hypoxia-induced vegf
mrna and hif-1 transcription, whereas  xxxg1830xxx  repression did not. human glioblastoma cell lines u118 and
u138 also showed hypoxia-induction of ampka2 as well as
vegf. immunohistochemistry analysis of human astrocytoma/glioma samples revealed ampka2 present in high
grade gliomas within hypoxic pseudopalisading microenvironments. these data suggest that prolonged hypoxia promotes
the expression and functional activation of ampka2 and
vegf production in glioma cell lines and glioblastoma multiform tumors, thus contributing to tumor survival and angiogenesis in high grade human gliomas. v 2006 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
hypoxia plays a critical role in regulating tumor
growth and angiogenesis. the cellular response to hypoxia is adaptive and necessary to maintain the minimal
energy levels required for cell survival. once a tumor
reaches a volume greater than a few mm3, regions of hypoxia begin to occur and neovascularization is essential
for tumor survival (folkman et al., 1989). angiogenesis,
the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing blood
vessels to supply the tumor with oxygen and nutrients,

is regulated by a number of angiogenic factors (claffey
et al., 1996; dvorak, 2000). an important angiogenic factor is  xxxg2413xxx -a (vegf), which
is over expressed in response to environmental hypoxia
(denko et al., 2003; michiels, 2004). human glioblastomas
are among the most highly vascularized tumors and express high levels of vegf (kaur et al., 2004). a primary
mechanism of increased vegf expression is through the
activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (hif-1), a heterodimeric transcription factor (semenza, 2000). under normoxia,  xxxg1048xxx  protein levels are regulated by ubiquitination and rapid proteosomal degradation (maxwell et al.,
2001; maxwell and ratcliffe, 2002). in hypoxic conditions,
 xxxg1048xxx  degradation is inhibited;  xxxg1048xxx  is stabilized,
translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and dimerizes with hif-1b/ xxxg105xxx  nuclear
translocator (arnt). this complex associates with coactivators, such as p300/creb, to induce transcription of
genes containing hypoxia responsive elements (hres),
such as vegf (fedele et al., 2002; lee et al., 2004).
amp-dependent kinase or amp-activated kinase (ampk)
is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic alpha
subunit, and two regulatory subunits, beta and gamma.
the  xxxg216xxx  contains a serine/threonine protein
kinase catalytic domain (carling, 2004). ampk has been
identiﬁed as a primary sensor of cellular energy change
by responding to increases in amp:atp ratios, concurrent with hypoxia or nutrient depletion (hardie, 1999;
hardie and carling, 1997). ampk is activated by the increase in amp and in turn activates catabolic pathways
and provides general repression of anabolic pathways by
direct phosphorylation of downstream substrates, resulting in cellular protection from metabolic or nutritional
stress (hardie et al., 2003). previous reports have shown
that ampk is activated in hypoxia (frederich et al., 2005;
lee et al., 2003; marsin et al., 2002; nagata et al., 2003).

repression of total ampka with chemical inhibitors or
dominant negative isoform over expression represses  xxxg1048xxx  dependent transcription (hwang et al., 2004; lee et al.,
2003). however, there are two distinct ampk alpha isoforms— xxxg1830xxx  and ampka2. although highly homologous, it is becoming clear that  xxxg1830xxx  and ampka2
have exclusive functions. mouse genetic deletion studies
have shown that ampka2-null mice demonstrate glucose
intolerance and reduced insulin sensitivity, while the
 xxxg1830xxx -null mice do not show any appreciable alterations (viollet et al., 2003a; viollet et al., 2003b). however,
the potential roles for the selective ampk alpha isoform
regulation and activity in response to hypoxia have not
been clearly evaluated. the studies performed here investigated the role of ampk in the response to hypoxia in
u373 glioma cells and whether the catalytic alpha isoforms of ampk show differential gene expression or functional roles in this response. rnai technology targeting
ampk alpha isoforms selectively repressed protein levels
and isoform speciﬁc activities. these studies indicate that
ampka2, but not  xxxg1830xxx , is selectively induced in
hypoxic conditions and signiﬁcantly contributes to vegf
expression in human glioma cells as well as in high grade
glioblastoma tumors.
materials and methods
cell line and culture conditions, antibodies,
and chemical effectors
human glioma cell lines, u373, u118, u138, and u87,
were maintained at 37°c in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle
medium (dmem) (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 10% fbs, and penstrep (100 ug/ml). cells were
cultured either under normoxic conditions (5% co2,
21% o2, 74% n2) or hypoxic conditions (5% co2, 2%
o2, 93% n2) as determined previously to be effective for
maximal activation of vegf expression without cytotoxicity through 48 h treatment (claffey and robinson,
1996; shih et al., 1999). antibodies used for immunoblots:  xxxg1830xxx  and ampka2 were from us biological
(swampscott, ma), purchased p-ampk(thr172) and
phospho-p70s6k(thr389) from cell signaling technology
(beverly, ma), and b-actin from abcam (cambridge, ma).
chemical effectors aicar (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-b-d-ribofuranoside) and  xxxd2378xxx  were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).
northern blot analysis
total rna was extracted using rneasy rna extraction kit (qiagen, chatsworth, ca). northern blot was
performed as described previously (claffey et al., 1998;
glia doi 10.1002/glia

hong et al., 2003). hybridization was carried out overnight at 65°c with [a32p]dctp-labeled human vegf 165
acc i/nco i fragment (823 base pairs) and an [a32p]
dctp-labeled human  xxxg2133xxx  probe bamh i/bamh i fragment (2473 base pairs) (atcc, rockville, md). a ribosome-associated protein cdna probe, 36b4, was used as
a loading control. blots were washed at high stringency
(1% sds, 1x ssc at 60°c) and exposed to kodak mr
ﬁlm. quantiﬁcation was determined by densitometry
using imagequant software.
rna interference
sirna oligos were obtained from dharmacon (lafayette, co) and were used to speciﬁcally target either
 xxxg1830xxx  or ampka2 subunits of the ampk heterotrimer. rnai transfections were performed with oligofectamine (invitrogen) in optimem according to manufacturer’s protocols at various concentrations. post-transfection, cells were allowed to recover overnight and refed
24 h before treatment with normoxic or hypoxic conditions.
rnai experiments were performed at least three times to
assure representative results.
sds-page and immunoblots
cytoplasmic extracts were obtained as described previously (claffey et al., 1998). protein extracts were separated on 10% sds-page and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. immunoblots were performed using
various primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated species appropriate igg secondary antibodies
diluted in blocking buffer according to manufacturer’s
protocols. blots were developed using ecl reagents.
vegf elisa assay
vegf capture elisas were performed as described
previously (shih et al., 1999). culture supernatants in
triplicate were collected from cell culture wells and cleared
by centrifugation. the samples were buffered with tris-hcl
ph 7.5 to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mm prior to analysis.
quantitative real-time pcr
cellular total rna was harvested using rneasy kit
(qiagen) and reverse transcribed with random hexamer
primers using powerscript rt strips (bd biosciences,
palo alto, ca). quantitative pcr primers were designed
using abi primer express software for use with a syber
green detection kit (qiagen). sequences of qrt-pcr primers are in table 1.
samples in duplicate or triplicate were run on an abi
7900 thermocycler for 40 cycles, and results were ana-

model described by lui and saint (liu and saint, 2002).
results were normalized to an internal control gene,
hucyclophilin a.
luciferase assay
cells were transfected with sirna oligos, as described
above, along with a 5x hif-1 promoter element luciferase reporter (claffey et al., 1998), luciferase control
vector, or cmv driven beta-galactosidase vector, and
treated with either normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. cells
were harvested with a passive lysis buffer from assay
kit, and luciferase activity was measured according to
supplier’s instructions (promega, madison, wi). luciferase activity was normalized to beta-galactosidase expression as determined with a similar kit (promega).
immunoﬂuorescence
cells were grown on coverslips prior to exposure to
normoxia or hypoxia. cells were washed with pbs and
ﬁxed with 10% formalin in pbs. cells were incubated in
0.01% triton x-100 detergent for 3 min, washed in pbs,
and blocked in 3% bsa/pbs at rt for 1 h. primary antibodies were added at a 1:50 dilution (5 ug/ml) in 3%
bsa/pbs and incubated at rt for 1 h. cells were washed
and a secondary antibody at a 1:800 dilution was added
and incubated for 30 min at rt. finally, coverslips were
washed thoroughly with pbs and mounted onto slides
with pbs:glycerol.
human glioma sample immunohistochemistry
parafﬁn sections were received from tom mikkelsen
at the hermelin brain tumor center at henry ford
hospital in detroit, michigan. slides were processed after antigen retrieval in sodium citrate buffer ph 6.0 for
20 min at 95°c. slides were blocked with powerblock
(biogenex, san ramon, ca) for 10 min; and a 1:200 dilution primary antibody, anti- xxxg1830xxx  or ampka2 (us
biological), was incubated overnight at 4°c. biotinolyated
secondary was incubated for 30 min at rt and slides were
developed using abc (vector laboratories, burlingame,
ca) and dab (electron microscopy sciences, hatﬁeld, pa)
reagents. methyl green was added as a counter stain.
slides were imaged using white light microscopy on a
zeiss axioplan microscope and quantiﬁed using imagepro
plus software (mediacybernetics, silver spring, md).
statistical analysis
data from individual experiments were represented as
mean 6 standard error unless otherwise stated. statistical comparison of groups was performed using a 2-tailed
student’s t-test with appropriate tests for equal variances. statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned and indicated
as p < 0.05 (*) or p < 0.01 (**).

chemical modulators of ampk affect
hypoxia induced vegf expression
to determine if ampk has a role in the regulation of
the hypoxia-inducible gene, vegf, the ampk activating
agent, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-4-ribofuranoside (aicar), and an  xxxd1930xxx ,  xxxd2378xxx , were used to treat human u373 glioblastoma cells
under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. cells were treated
with aicar,  xxxd2378xxx , or no treatment control
and exposed to hypoxia for 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. the treated
cells were harvested for total rna and northern blots performed to analyze vegf and  xxxg2133xxx  mrna expression
levels, fig. 1a. no treatment controls showed a large
increase in vegf mrna in hypoxia as compared to normoxia at 12 h. the addition of aicar (0.5 mm) showed
increases over the hypoxic induction of vegf and  xxxg2133xxx

mrnas as compared to vehicle control. the addition of
5- xxxd2378xxx  (10 lm) completely repressed the hypoxic expression of vegf and  xxxg2133xxx  mrnas. in time
course analysis, 5- xxxd2378xxx  effectively repressed vegf
mrna levels from 2 to 12 h in hypoxia, fig. 1b.
to evaluate the potential inﬂuence of ampk on hif-1
mediated transcription, required for vegf mrna induction under hypoxic conditions, an hif-1 dependent
transcriptional assay was performed with the  xxxd1930xxx ,  xxxd2378xxx . transcriptional activity was
measured using a transiently transfected hif-1 responsive element driven luciferase reporter normalized to
beta-galactosidase transfection baseline control, fig. 1c.
under hypoxia, there was a signiﬁcant, 12-fold increase
in hif-1 dependent transcription. this induction was
completely inhibited to normoxic levels by  xxxd1930xxx  ( xxxd2378xxx ) treatment prior to hypoxic induction. there was no regulation of hif-1 dependent transcription using aicar alone in a similar assay (data not
shown).

cells exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions. under
normoxic conditions the  xxxg1830xxx  isoform was the predominant isoform, showing 2- to 4-fold more mrna than
the ampka2 isoform. exposure of u373 cells to 12 h of
hypoxia showed little change in the baseline ratio of
 xxxg1830xxx  to ampka2 mrna levels. however, over a
24 h hypoxic treatment, a signiﬁcant 3-fold increase of
ampka2 mrna was observed over normoxic controls,
fig. 2a.
a direct analysis of ampka isoform protein expression
over a time course of hypoxia treatment showed a similar
pattern of increasing ampka2 protein levels. the levels of
phosphorylated ampk (p-ampk) also increased with exposure to hypoxia.  xxxg1830xxx  protein levels did not signiﬁcantly change with the hypoxic time course, fig. 2b.
in order to determine whether hypoxia affects ampka
isoform intracellular distribution, isoform-speciﬁc ﬂuorescent immunohistochemistry was employed on cells exposed
to normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h, fig. 3. no
signiﬁcant change was observed in the localization of
 xxxg1830xxx  between normoxia and hypoxia, showing a widespread nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution. ampka2 was
found to redistribute within the cell from a uniform cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution to a predominantly nuclear
localization under hypoxia. these data demonstrate that
ampka2, but not  xxxg1830xxx , is regulated at the mrna
and protein levels by hypoxia in u373 cells.

inhibition of ampk alpha isoform expression
by rna interference
in order to evaluate possible ampk alpha isoform-speciﬁc functions, rna interference (rnai) protocols were
performed to repress ampk alpha isoform gene expression and function. figure 4a shows  xxxg1830xxx  mrna
levels determined by quantitative rt-pcr when cells
were transfected with either  xxxg1830xxx - or ampka2-targeted sirna oligos. post-transfected samples show that
 xxxg1830xxx  mrna levels were inhibited at greater than
90% in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions when
treated with  xxxg1830xxx  rnai. ampka2 sirna transfection
did not signiﬁcantly affect  xxxg1830xxx  mrna levels. conversely, fig. 4b shows a similar pattern for the ampka2
rnai. ampka2 mrna was repressed greater than 90% in
normoxia and hypoxia by ampka2 rnai, and  xxxg1830xxx 
sirnas did not signiﬁcantly affect ampka2 mrna levels.
to determine the effectiveness of the rnai treatments
at the protein level, ampka isoforms were evaluated by
direct immunoblot of total cell extracts taken 60 h after
transfection, fig. 4c. the  xxxg1830xxx  rnai repressed
 xxxg1830xxx  protein in normoxia and hypoxia when compared to mock transfected controls. hypoxia alone greatly
increased ampka2 protein, as was observed in fig. 2b.
the ampka2 sirna was effective at repressing ampka2
protein levels in hypoxia, although the protein levels in
normoxia were not signiﬁcantly affected. these data
demonstrate that rnai against the individual ampka isoforms was effective at repressing the targeted ampka
mrna and protein in u373 glioblastoma cells.

the effect of ampka isoform repression
by rnai on hypoxia-induced ampk activation
and downstream signal transduction
in order to determine the effect of ampk alpha isoform
repression on functional ampk protein, we examined the
level of total phosphorylated ampk, which detects both
p- xxxg1830xxx  and p-ampka2 isoforms at thr172, an activating phosphorylation site (woods et al., 2003). figure 5a
shows that hypoxia increased p-ampk and that application of sirna targeted to  xxxg1830xxx  repressed the total
p-ampk considerably under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. ampka2 rnai also repressed total p-ampk under
normoxia and hypoxia, although to a lesser extent than
 xxxg1830xxx . since  xxxg1830xxx  mrna and protein are more
abundant in the u373 cells, ampka2 repression only partially affects the total amount of p-ampk protein.
one essential function for ampk is to repress protein
translation by blocking mtor/s6 kinase pathways
through phosphorylation of the  xxxg2337xxx /2 complex (inoki
et al., 2003). to determine whether the mtor pathway
inhibition was selective to either ampk alpha isoform,
levels of phospho-p70s6k were evaluated in ampk rnai
repressed cells. hypoxia alone signiﬁcantly reduced the
amount of phospho-p70s6k signal in u373 glioblastoma
cells, fig. 5b. this data supports the observation of
krause et al., 2002, which states that ampk activation
leads to the repression of phospho-p70s6k through modulation of the mtor pathway. under normoxic conditions,  xxxg1830xxx  and ampka2 rnai resulted in increased
levels of phospho-p70s6k. it was found that the rnai
treatment for both ampka isoforms increased the phospho-p70s6k in hypoxia, with the repression of ampka2
demonstrating a slightly greater increase in phospho-

p70s6k. these data indicate that both ampk alpha isoforms contribute to the repression of the protein translational pathways by repressing active p70s6k under
hypoxia. this also conﬁrms that rnai to ampk alpha
isoforms is effective at altering downstream pathways of
ampk and is sufﬁcient to study the ampk alpha isoforms independently.
ampka2 selectively contributes
to hypoxia-induced vegf expression
at the mrna and protein levels
in an effort to examine the potential selectivity for the
ampka isoforms in regulating important hypoxia responsive genes, the hypoxic induction of vegf under conditions where  xxxg1830xxx  or ampka2 is repressed with rnai
treatments was examined. hypoxia responsive u373 cells
were transfected with mock or ampka isoform speciﬁc
sirna oligo pools. to assess rnai effectiveness for each
experiment, the level of  xxxg1830xxx  or ampka2 speciﬁc
mrna repression was determined to be greater than 90%
of mock transfected control by qrt-pcr (data not shown).
total cellular rna was analyzed for vegf mrna expression by qrt-pcr, and the level of secreted vegf in conditioned media from the same cells was determined by
elisa. figure 6a shows the quantitative levels of vegf
mrna levels determined for normoxic and hypoxic cells
corresponding to mock transfected,  xxxg1830xxx  rnai, or
ampka2 rnai treated u373 cells. only the ampka2
rnai treated cells showed repressed hypoxic-induced
vegf mrna at a signiﬁcant level (50% of non-transfected
cells), whereas  xxxg1830xxx  rnai had no effect. similarly, the
conditioned media of the ampka2 rnai treated cells
showed signiﬁcant repression of secreted vegf protein, as

levels by elisa assay, and ampka2 repression resulted
in similar decrease of vegf protein production at the
time of harvest (data not shown). the novel ﬁnding that
ampka2 repression selectively affects hypoxia induced
vegf expression supports the hypothesis that the
ampka isoforms have distinct functions.

mock controls. there was no effect on the total  xxxg1048xxx 
protein levels when cells were treated with either ampk
alpha isoform sirna oligos as determined by direct immunoblot (data not shown). these data suggest that at
least some of the effect on vegf protein by ampka2 is
through an hif-1 dependent transcription activity in
spite of not affecting the total level of  xxxg1048xxx  protein.

ampka2 mrna is regulated by hypoxia
in several glioblastoma cell lines
to determine if ampka2 regulation by hypoxia and
contribution to vegf production is selective to u373
cells, three additional human glioblastoma cell lines were
subjected to hypoxia and rna isolated for qrt-pcr analysis, and conditioned medias evaluated for vegf levels. in
all cell lines tested, u373, u118, u138, and u87, there
was no apparent regulation of  xxxg1830xxx  mrna levels by
hypoxia, fig. 8a. interestingly, in addition to u373 cells,
u118 and u138 cells demonstrated increases in ampka2
mrna when treated with hypoxia, fig. 8b. in contrast,
the u87 cell line showed signiﬁcant levels of ampka2
mrna levels in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
to analyze the balance between  xxxg1830xxx  and ampka2
levels in each cell line, we calculated the ampka2 to
 xxxg1830xxx  ratios as deﬁned by mrna expression levels,
fig. 8c. this analysis was revealing in that u373 cells
demonstrated the most signiﬁcant increase in the
ampka2: xxxg1830xxx  ratio with hypoxia and that u87 cells
had a high ampka2: xxxg1830xxx  ratio in both normoxic
and hypoxic conditions. the u118 and u138 appeared
similar to the u373 line, showing higher ampka2:
 xxxg1830xxx  ratios in hypoxia.
to compare the observed levels of ampk alpha isoforms with vegf expression and secretion, the conditioned medias from the same set of cells were tested for
vegf protein by elisa. the expression and secretion
of vegf was upregulated in all three glioblastoma lines
demonstrating hypoxic increases in ampka2, namely,
u373, u118, and u138 cells, albeit at varying levels,
fig. 8d. interestingly, u87 cells demonstrated a continuous and high level of vegf production in both normoxic

and hypoxic conditions, which correlates with the high
ampka2 expression observed by qrt-pcr analysis.
these data indicate that the hypoxic regulation of
ampka2 occurs in at least three glioblastoma cell lines.
the u87 cells show no hypoxia regulation, but have a
constitutive high ampka2: xxxg1830xxx  ratio consistent
with the continuous vegf production observed. these
data support the hypothesis that ampka2 not only is a
signiﬁcant contributor to the response of glioblastoma
cells to hypoxic conditions, particularly with respect to
vegf production, but that the balance between  xxxg1830xxx 
and ampka2 levels might be one mechanism that contributes to the hypoxic response in different cells.
ampka2 protein expression may be
associated with high tumor grade
clinical glioma samples
in a retrospective analysis of low, mid, and high grade
clinical human glioma samples, archived parafﬁn slides
were evaluated for  xxxg1830xxx  and ampka2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. representative examples
are shown in fig. 9a.  xxxg1830xxx  expression did not signiﬁcantly change with glioma grade. ampka2 expression was
nearly identical in low and mid grade glioma samples.
however, in high grade glioma samples, ampka2 expression was increased in individual cells. maximal ampka2
expression was typically observed in and around areas of
vascular occlusion and pseudopalisades, fig. 9b. high
grade human glioma tumors with areas of pseudopalisades
have been reported to be hypoxic, and correlate with  xxxg1048xxx  and vegf expression (brat et al., 2004; zagzag et al.,
2000). thus, our data suggest that high levels of ampka2
correspond to high grade gliomas and hypoxic microenvironments deﬁned by pseudopalisading histopathologies.
discussion
glioma responses to hypoxic microenvironments are
likely to affect tumor angiogenesis, progression, and invasion (brat et al., 2003). ampk is a central regulator
of cellular homeostasis under stress and is activated by
hypoxia (hardie et al., 2003). we hypothesized that
ampk plays a crucial role in the response to hypoxia in
glioblastoma. ampk alpha isoforms are known to be differentially expressed in various tissues (jorgensen et al.,
2004; stapleton et al., 1996), which suggests that the
ampk alpha isoforms could have distinct functions. to
investigate this possibility, we evaluated the regulation
of ampk alpha isoforms in the human glioblastoma cell
line, u373.  xxxg1830xxx  showed a constitutive pattern of
expression in u373 cells cultured under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions. conversely, little ampka2 was
detected in u373 cells in normoxia, but ampka2 expression at the mrna and protein level was induced by hypoxia. ampka2 was also observed to concentrate in the
nucleus under hypoxic conditions. the novel observation
that ampka2 is induced in hypoxia, along with its nuclear subcellular localization, indicated that ampka2
may have distinct functions from  xxxg1830xxx .

hypoxia has been shown to regulate the expression of
genes required for cellular adaptation to stress (helfman
and falanga, 1993; shih and claffey, 1998). one of the
classic hypoxia regulated genes is the angiogenic growth
factor vegf. we have previously shown that vegf is
signiﬁcantly induced in u373 cells in response to hypoxia (claffey and robinson, 1996). chemical inhibition
of ampk with  xxxd2378xxx  completely abolished
the hypoxic induction of vegf mrna. since vegf is
regulated transcriptionally in hypoxia through hif dependent mechanisms (fedele et al., 2002; semenza,
1999), we utilized an hif-1 dependent luciferase reporter
construct to evaluate whether ampk modulates hif-1
dependent transcription. repression of ampk with 5iodotubericidin abrogated the hif-1 dependent luciferase
activity. investigative studies aimed at determining the
role for ampk in hypoxic responses have incorporated
the overexpression of dominant negative  xxxg1830xxx  or
ampka2 isoforms, or chemical inhibitors (hwang et al.,
2004; lee et al., 2003; nagata et al., 2003; yun et al.,
2005). these studies are limited in their ability to assign
speciﬁc activities to ampk alpha isoforms due to the
likely saturation of the beta and gamma subunits with
dominant negative overexpression and lack of isoform
speciﬁcity of chemical inhibitors (stapleton et al., 1996;

woods et al., 2000). our ﬁndings with ampk chemical
inhibition conﬁrm these previous reports, but have the
same limitations to distinguish ampk alpha isoform speciﬁc activities in hypoxia.
to overcome the limitations of total repression of
ampk alpha, we employed rnai technology to directly
inhibit the expression of each ampk alpha isoform in
normoxia and hypoxia. rnai was effective in repressing
each ampk alpha isoform. since hypoxia inhibits phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase (arsham et al., 2003) and
ampk has been shown to have a role in this regulation
(inoki et al., 2003; kimura et al., 2003; krause et al.,
2002), rnai of alpha isoforms was tested for its effects
on this downstream pathway. rnai for both ampk
alpha isoforms reversed the hypoxic repression of phosphorylated p70s6 kinase, suggesting that both ampk
alpha isoforms share the function of inhibition of phospho-p70s6 kinase under hypoxia mediated through the
 xxxg2337xxx /2 repression of mtor. these results indicate that
rnai is effective at decreasing ampk activity and affecting common downstream pathways regulated by ampk.
in contrast to the p70s6 kinase data, hif-1 transcription and vegf production in hypoxia were not similarly
affected by repression of either ampk alpha isoforms.

transcriptional activity in normoxia, and interestingly,
enhanced hif-1 transcription in hypoxia. in contrast,
inhibition of ampka2 had no effect on hif-1 dependent
transcriptional activity in normoxia, but repressed  xxxg1048xxx  dependent transcription in hypoxia. ampka2 inhibition led to decreases in vegf expression and secretion,
while  xxxg1830xxx  had no signiﬁcant effect. it is clear from
our observations that ampk alpha isoforms have distinct effects on hif-1 dependent transcription and
vegf induction in hypoxia. our results demonstrate
that speciﬁc inhibition of alpha isoforms with rnai
affords the ability to assign downstream functions to
individual alpha subunits of ampk that may have been
missed during previous studies.
the observation that aicar did not promote hif-1
transcription or vegf production in normoxia may be
explained by the fact that u373 cells have little
ampka2 in normoxic conditions and, thus, activation of
the predominant  xxxg1830xxx  isoform in normoxia could

not activate a transcriptional response. secondly, without hypoxia dependent stabilization of hif-1, the promotion of hif-1 dependent transcription, partially mediated by ampka2 activity, cannot occur under normoxia. ampka2 upregulation and nuclear localization
under hypoxia and the regulation of hif-1 transcription
suggest that ampka2 may function through mechanisms that require the hypoxic environment. interestingly,
frederich et al. examined the relationship between hypoxia and amp concentrations on ampk activity in isolated, perfused rat hearts (frederich et al., 2005). in this
model, hypoxia promoted a shift in ampka2 activity to
require less amp, which may be due to increased phosphorylation of ampka2 on thr172. thus, hypoxia kinase
cascades and ampk phosphorylation may also promote
hif-1 activation mediated through the ampka2 isoform.

to determine whether the hypoxic regulation of ampka2
is selective to u373 cells. the results show that ampka2
is upregulated by hypoxia in three of the four cell lines
examined. these results suggest that the balance between the two alpha isoforms or the presence and expression of ampka2 alone may be factors that contribute to
varying hypoxic responses in different cell lines. the u87
cell line data also indicate that there may be hypoxia independent mechanisms where ampka2 contributes to the
control of vegf expression. this possibility is supported
by data that show that phosphorylation pathways can
activate ampk independently of increasing amp levels
(frederich et al., 2005).
to determine if ampk alpha isoforms may be regulated in human tumors, we obtained samples of various
grade glioma tumors. histological examination revealed
that high grade tumors have dilated or occluded vessels
and surrounding pseudopalisading tumor cells. it is
known that the expression of vegf and the vascularity
of the tumors increase with grade (broholm and laursen,
2004; kaur et al., 2004). glioblastoma multiform with
psuedopalisading hypoxic regions have also been shown to
have increased hif-1 and vegf expression (brat et al.,
2004). immunohistochemistry for ampka2 showed increased expression with tumor grade and was associated
with these psuedopalisading regions. taken together with
our in vitro data, we believe that ampka2 may play a key
role in increased vegf production and angiogenesis in
vivo, particularly in tumor hypoxic microenvironments.
in conclusion, we have shown that hypoxia induces
ampka2 mrna and protein and promotes translocation
of ampka2 to the nucleus. repression of ampka2 decreases the hypoxic induction of hif-1 dependent transcription and vegf induction, while  xxxg1830xxx  repression
does not. given the fact that total  xxxg1048xxx  protein levels
were not affected by rnai for ampka2, it is likely that
ampka2 may promote hif-1 nuclear translocation, nuclear retention, and/or association with transcriptional coactivators, such as p300, possibilities currently under investigation. finally, it was also observed in human glioma
tumors that ampka2 expression was associated with tumor grade and hypoxic psuedopalisading regions. these
observations indicate that ampk alpha isoforms, while
having some overlapping functions, do have distinct responses to and functions under hypoxia. previous reports
have shown ampk to be clinically relevant in diabetes
(jorgensen et al., 2004; viollet et al., 2003b) and heart ischemia (young et al., 2005). it will be critical to re-evaluate the distinct functions of the catalytic ampk alpha subunits in both normal and pathological settings. these studies provide a precedent for continued clinical evaluation of
the role for ampk in glioma tumors and to investigate
the potential utility of ampka2 speciﬁc therapeutic intervention in advanced glioma.
