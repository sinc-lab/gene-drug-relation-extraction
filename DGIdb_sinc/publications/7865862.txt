the domestic pig was used to develop a new model for evaluating the emetogenic potential of
anticancer drugs and determining the antiemetic activity of drugs. emesis was characterized by
expulsion of solid or liquid material. in each animal, the number of vomits after infusion of the
emetogenic drug (infusion in ketamine and xylazine anesthesia) was recorded in 1-hr periods
during the first 4 hr and then in a 4- and a 16-hr period. intravenous infusion of cisplatin caused a
concentration-dependent emetic response. anti-cancer drugs other than cisplatin such as carboplatin,  xxxd1800xxx , cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide, also induced emesis, indicating that the
domestic pig is suitable to detect the emetogenic potential of chemotherapeutic agents. a
cisplatin dose of 2 mg/kg i.v. proved to be most suitable for studying the effect of potential
antiemetic drugs (applied as i.v. injection), because this cisplatin dose caused consistent emetic
responses without other toxic signs in the 24 hr following its infusion. emesis induced by
cisplatin was reduced by high doses of metoclopramide (25 mg/pig; - 0.8 mg/kg). the more
selective dopamine d 2 receptor antagonists,  xxxd115xxx  and  xxxd1927xxx , even at high doses
(25-50 mg/pig; - 0.8-1.6 mg/kg), did not inhibit cisplatin-induced emesis, nor did haloperidol
up to 20 mg/pig ( - 0.6 mg/kg). sulpride (50 mg/pig; - 1.6 mg/kg) halved the occurrence of
vomits in the first 4 hr after cisplatin, but this effect was followed by an increase in the frequency
of vomits; thus, no change in the total number of vomits was observed in the 24-hr observation
period. diazepam (10 mg/pig; ~ 0.3 mg/kg) did not influence the number of vomits, but at 50
rag/pig ( - 1.6 mg/kg) it acted antiemetically. the most potent antagonism of emesis was
achieved by the use of 5-ht 3 receptor antagonists, mdl-72222, ics 205-930 ( xxxd3451xxx ),
ondansetron, and zacopride (2-30 mg/pig; - 0.06--0.9 mg/kg). this antiemetic effect was most
pronounced in the first 4 hr after cisplatin infusion. in conclusion, domestic pigs are suitable for
detecting and evaluating the emetogenic and antiemetic potential of drugs. their high sensitivity
to emetogenic anticancer drugs and their susceptibility to currently known antiemetic drugs are
comparable to that of cancer patients.

introduction
emesis and nausea are major complications of cancer
chemotherapy (laszlo, 1983). they cause serious discomfort to the patient, critical metabolic disturbances, and
exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity.

the emetic potency of cytotoxic drugs is not related to
their therapeutic potency and differs markedly: for example, emesis occurred in more than 90% of patients treated
with cisplatin and in less than 30% of patients treated with
antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate
(borison and mccarthy, 1983). the need for drugs that are
able to ameliorate the patient's well-being during chemotherapy is steadily increasing, as is the need to develop
chemotherapeutics with better compliance and lower emetogenic potential.

the development of animal models of emesis is, therefore, particularly important to discover new antiemetic
agents and chemotherapeutics with lower emetogenic potency. such models might also contribute to the better
understanding of mechanisms involved in nausea and
emesis. at present, ferrets are most commonly used to test
either the emetogenic potential of a new anticancer agent
or the antiemetic effect of a newly developed drug. several
other species (e.g., pigeons, cats, dogs, etc.) are also often
employed in experimental studies to investigate emetogenic or antiemetogenic effects of drugs. the usefulness of
young domestic pigs as an alternative to dogs in cardiovascular investigations has been established (see, e.g.,
stroman and metzenauer, 1988), but their suitability as
experimental animals for emesis studies has not yet been
examined.
in the present study we have, therefore, investigated
whether the domestic pig can be used as a model for the
detection of emesis induced by either cisplatin or other
chemotherapeutic agents, and, if so, whether different antiemetic agents can influence cisplatin-evoked emesis.

methods
declaration
all experiments have been performed in compliance
with the german law for the protection of animals.

animals
healthy young, 12-15-week-old domestic pigs of both
sexes (28-40 kg) obtained from rvf, frankfurt/main,
frg, were housed in individual boxes of about 10m 2 with
an acryl-coated floor that was being heated. the strain is
not strictly classified but belongs to the "deutsches
landschwein" type. they were maintained at constant
environmental conditions (temperature 22 ° + i°c; humidity 50%-60%; light/dark rhythm 12:12 hr). they received standardized pellet food (hemo-schweinefutter;
hemo, heilbronn, frg) for raising pigs twice daily (8:00
am and 2:00 pm). water was also available ad libitum.

experimental procedure
on the day of the experiment (between 6:30 and 7:00
am), pigs were lightly anesthetized with ketamine (10
mg/kg, i.v.) (ketavet®) and xylazine (2 mg/kg, i.v.) (rompun ®) and a cannula inserted into a superficial vein of one
of the extremities. cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide were administered i.v. at different
doses at a total administration time of 15 min.  xxxd1800xxx  was given i.v. as a bolus injection. after removing the
cannula the animals were placed in their boxes for recovery from anesthesia (on the average for 30 rain) and for

subsequent observation of emesis (over 24 hr). food and
water were available ad libitum. emesis was characterized
by expulsion of solid or liquid material from the gastrointestinal tract (ingested food, gastric juice contaminated by
bile, etc.). an observer recorded the number of vomits and
the behavioral changes hourly during the first 4 hr and
then in the subsequent 4-hr period. in the following 16-hr
period, it was done by counting the number of vomits
found on the floor of the cages. drugs were given i.v. 15
min prior to cisplatin infusion.
a possible exacerbating or inhibitory influence of the
short-term anesthesia on drug-induced emesis was investigated as follows: 1) anesthetized domestic pigs received
instead of cisplatin a saline (0.9%  xxxg2020xxx ) infusion only; 2)
conscious domestic pigs were slightly restrained in a special cage for the duration of drug administration, and the
anticancer drug was infused via an ear vein; 3) domestic
pigs were anesthetized as described above. thereafter, the
anesthesia was maintained constantly for 4 hr by infusing
pentobarbital (0.15-0.3 mg/kg/min) (nembutav). cisplatin (2 mg/kg) was infused as mentioned above.

statistical evaluation
mean values with standard error (sem) were calculated. when relevant and possible, student's t test (twotailed) was employed for analysis of the significance of
differences between groups.

drugs
cisplatin (synthesized by our department of chemistry) was prepared in saline (0.9%  xxxg2020xxx ) at 70°-75°c
followed by gradual cooling to room temperature. this
solution was stable for at least 12 hr. mdl 72222
( i ah,3a,5ah-tropan-3-yl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate),
ics
205-930 ( xxxd3451xxx ) and zacopride were purchased from
research biochemical, inc., (natick, ma, usa). these
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists,  xxxd1927xxx  (sigma chemicals, mtinchen, frg) and diazepam (pfannenstiehl, hannover, frg) were dissolved in saline (0.9%  xxxg2020xxx ). metoclopramide ( xxxd2624xxx  ®, kali-chemie, hannover, frg),
ondansetron (zofran®, glaxo gmbh, hamburg, frg),  xxxd115xxx  (vergantan ®, schtirholz, mtinchen, frg),  xxxd1800xxx  (lyovac-cosmogen®, msd-msd pharma, mtinchen, frg), ifosfamide ( xxxd2327xxx  ®, asta medica ag,
frankfurt, frg), cyclophosphamide ( xxxd1779xxx  ®, asta
medica ag, frankfurt, frg), and carboplatin (carboplat ®, bristol-myers, neu-isenburg, frg) were used in
their commercial form.

clearly earlier after infusion of 5 mg/kg of cisplatin than
following the administration of lower doses.
the infusion of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg of cisplatin in the
domestic pig did not consistently cause vomits within a
24-hr period. when the dose was raised to 2 mg/kg, emesis
was induced in all animals. further increase in the dose of
cisplatin up to 3.5 and 5 mg/kg (i.v.) resulted in a dose-dependent increase of vomits during the first hour (table 2)
when considering the total number of vomits (table 2) in
the first 4 hr, there was, however, only a slight difference
between the three doses (2 mg/kg: 10.3 + 1.0 (n = 18); 3.5
mg/kg: 12.6 + 0.4 (n = 4); 5 mg/kg: 13.1 _+ 0.3 (n = 19);p
< 0.05). when the dose was raised to 10 mg/kg (i.v.), the
number of vomits was not further elevated. however, the
general condition of the animals and the development of
hematemesis indicated the extremely bad tolerance of this
high dose. some animals died within 48 hr.
irrespective of the dose of cisplatin, the maximum frequency of vomits was observed during the first 4 hr;
thereafter, the frequency declined. taking all vomits observed in 24 hr into consideration, there was no significant
difference between the three doses [2 mg/kg; 14.2 + 1.7 (n
= 18); 3.5 mg/kg: 15.4 _+ 0.4 (n = 4); 5 mg/kg: 16.8 _+ 0.7
(n = 19); results not shown in a table].
in addition to counting the vomits, behavioral changes
of animals were also recorded. on recovery from anesthesia, pigs treated with cisplatin (3.5 or 5 mg/kg, i.v.) displayed reduced exploratory behavior. between vomits, the
animals were quiet, and they looked tired and ill. their
food uptake was minimal, their drinking water consumption was relatively high. behavior of domestic pigs treated
with 2 mg/kg cisplatin was considered to be roughly normal within the usual 24-hr observation period. however,
in this context it should be noted that, in preliminary
experiments, such toxic signs as diarrhea and reduction in

motor activity and feeding behavior had generally been
observed 48 hr after infusion of 2 mg/kg cisplatin; these
toxic symptoms were avoided by sacrificing the pigs 24 hr
after cisplatin infusion. in all dose groups, a peculiar
phenomenon preceded vomiting: pigs had a pronounced
chewing accompanied by foam development around the
mouth and followed by swallowing movements. due to
the fact that 2 mg/kg cisplatin caused vomiting comparable with that induced by the higher dose and that the
former was tolerated by the animals without behavioral
changes, we decided to use the 2-mg/kg dose of cisplatin
in further studies.
in separate experiments, it has been demonstrated that
the short-term anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine
failed to induce emesis (n = 3). comparison of cisplatininduced emesis in conscious pigs with that of slightly
anesthetized pigs revealed that cisplatin-induced emesis
was not exacerbated by the anesthetics used in the present
study (table 3). furthermore, domestic pigs (n = 2) anesthetized by continuously infused pentobarbital showed
retches after giving cisplatin (table 3). since the pigs
fasted 18 hr before starting the experiments and were
intubated (leading to compression of the esophagus), they
could not vomit. at the dose of 2 mg/kg cisplatin, the first
retching was observed 48 min following cisplatin administration. the total number of fetchings amounted to 35 in
the first 4 hr. increasing the dose to 5 mg/kg (n = 2)
resulted in an extremely rapid onset (5 min) and high
frequency of retches (more than 100 in the first 4 hr).

emetogenic potential of some selected
chemotherapeutic agents
the platinum derivative carboplatin did not cause any
vomiting at the dose of 5 mg/kg, i.v.. the higher dose (10
mg/kg, i.v.) which corresponds to the recommended
human dose (400 mg/m 2) induced only one vomit in two
animals during the first 4 hr. vomits were, however, also
observed in the other two animals during the time thereafter (table 4)
 xxxd1800xxx  was investigated at a dose level of 2.0
mg/animal. taking the body weight of the domestic pigs
used in those experiments (29.5 kg on average) into consideration, we note that this dose is about two times higher

than the usual human dose. both pigs treated with  xxxd1800xxx  exhibited one vomit each in the first 8 hr of observation. in both pigs together a total of seven vomits was
observed within 24 hr after injection (table 4). higher
doses of  xxxd1800xxx  could not be investigated since the
dose used was extremely toxic for domestic pigs.
of alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide
were investigated at dose levels corresponding to usual
human dosages. cyclophosphamide caused vomiting
mainly in the first 4 hr of the observation period. by
contrast, emesis induced by ifosfamide was observed between 5 and 8 hr following drug administration (table 4).
frequency of vomiting was considerably higher than in
animals treated with cyclophosphamide.

effect of some selected antiemetics on vomiting
induced by cisplatin
our aim was to show that domestic pigs are basically
also sensitive not only to emetogenic compounds, but also
to antiemetic agents. therefore, we did not use more than
two to four animals in studies in which antiemetic compounds were tested. metoclopramide (25 mg/kg; - 0.8
mg/kg) halved the number of vomits in comparison with
that observed in vehicle-treated domestic pigs (table 5).

 xxxd1927xxx  and  xxxd115xxx  failed to reduce emesis induced by cisplatin even at the high doses of 25 ( - 0.8
mg/kg) and 50 mg/pig ( - 1.6 mg/kg), respectively, (table
5). a low dose of haloperidol (10 mg/pig, - 0.3 mg/kg,
i.v.) did not antagonize cisplatin-induced emesis at all
(table 5). haloperidol at the higher dose (20 mg/pig, i.v.)
even increased the number of vomits within the first 4 hr
(table 5). in domestic pigs treated with haloperidol,
marked signs of tardive dyskinesia, tremor accompanied
with sniffing, and stereotypic head movements were observed in the first 4-5 hr following drug injection. sulpiride (50 mg/pig, - 1.6 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced the frequency
of vomiting during the first 4 hr only. after this period, the
animals vomited slightly more frequently than did placebo-treated pigs (table 5). behaviorally, a marked reduction of motor activity and coordination was observed that
lasted for 4-5 hr. diazepam, as expected, caused slight
sedation at both dose levels (10 and 50 mg/pig, i.v.).
however, it resulted only in a short prolongation of the
recovery period from anesthesia to 30-45 min. the low
dose of diazepam did not antagonize the cisplatin-induced
emesis. at the high dose of 50 mg/pig ( - 1.6 mg/kg, i.v.)
the incidence of vomiting was clearly reduced during the
first 4 hr, but not changed compared to the controls in the
subsequent observation periods (table 5), indicating a
relatively long-lasting effect.

considerably inhibited emesis in the first 4 hr following
cisplatin infusion. thereafter, the number of vomits was
comparable with that observed in control animals indicating the disappearance of the inhibitory effect of the drugs
used (table 6). the higher dose of ondansetron (10
mg/pig; ~ 0.3 mg/kg) abolished the cisplatin-induced
emesis in the first 4 hr. at this dose, its antiemetic effect
lasted considerably longer than at the lower dose (table
6). zacopride at the lower dose of 2.0 mg/pig (~ 0.06

mg/kg) reduced the number of vomits during the first 4
hr of observation (table 6). in the following observation
periods, the frequency of vomits was increased. accordingly the number of vomits in the total observation
period of 24 hr was not significantly different from that
in the control group (table 6). the higher dose of zacopride (5.0 mg/pig; - 0.16 mg/kg) abolished emesis for
more than 8 hr. during a 24-hr observation following
cisplatin-infusion, only two vomits/pig were observed
(table 6).
after treatment with 5-ht 3 receptor antagonists, the
general condition of the pigs appeared to be normal. additional antiemetic treatment with 5-ht 3 antagonists apparently improved the eating behavior of animals receiving
the low dose of cisplatin (2 mg/kg).

discussion
in the present study, it has been demonstrated that the
administration of cisplatin causes reliable emetic responses in domestic pigs, as has previously been shown
with this drug in ferrets (costall et al., 1986; florczyk et
al., 1982; miner et al., 1986), and other animal species
such as dogs (gylys et al., 1979) and cats (mccarthy and
borison, 1980). in our experiments, the domestic pig
proved to be more sensitive to the emetogenic effect of
cisplatin than the ferret did. the high dose (10 mg/kg i.v.)
of cisplatin recommended for ferrets was not tolerated by
pigs at all. by halving the dose, we note that the tolerance
to the drug became only slightly better. at the dose of 2
mg/kg of cisplatin, no toxic symptoms were observed
without any major reduction of the frequency of emetic
responses. in comparison to the higher doses of cisplatin,
the onset of emesis was slightly delayed by about 60 min,
but the total number of vomits was comparable to that
induced by the high dose of cisplatin. the lower dose of
cisplatin of 2 mg/kg roughly corresponds to a human
therapeutic dose level (50-75 mg/m2). according to recent
investigations, the emetogenic potency of cisplatin in the
dog is clearly stronger than that in the ferret (cohen et al.,
1989) and comparable with that of domestic pigs. the
highest dose of carboplatin (10 mg/kg) investigated in the
present study roughly corresponds to the recommended
human dose (400 mg/m2). at this dose level, vomiting was
only sporadically observed indicating that the emetogenic
potential of this platinum derivative seems to be less than
that of cisplatin. other chemotherapeutics such as  xxxd1800xxx , ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide, also evoked
emetic responses in domestic pigs. emetogenic doses of
these drugs investigated in the present study were also
comparable to doses used in human therapy (physicians'
desk reference, 1993, rote liste, 1994). it can be, therefore, concluded that domestic pigs are suitable animals for
studying emetogenic effects of anticancer drugs and they
are more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents than ferrets
are. recently, fukui et al. (1993a) suggested that the
monkey is more sensitive to cisplatin than other species
are. comparison of their data with our present results
suggests that the domestic pig is at least as sensitive as, or
even more sensitive than, the monkey to cisplatin (and
probably also to other chemotherapeutics).
the second main finding of the present study was that
agents frequently used in the clinic to control vomiting
induced by different types of anticancer drugs were also
effective against emesis evoked by cisplatin in domestic
pigs. diazepam antagonized the cisplatin-induced emesis
in domestic pigs as it did in ferrets (costall et al., 1987).
this effect of diazepam is probably related to its anxiolytic
and sedative actions. diazepam delayed the recovery of
animals from anesthesia induced by ketamine and xylazine. however, no marked signs of sedation were observed
even at the higher dose of diazepam. thus, it is likely that

first of all anxiolytic effects account for the diazepam-induced reduction of the number of vomits.
in cancer patients receiving cisplatin, emesis is largely
unaffected by either conventional doses of metoclopramide (gralla et al., 1981) or conventional and high doses
of the more selective  xxxg656xxx  antagonists,
 xxxd1927xxx  (tonato et al., 1985) and  xxxd115xxx  (saller et
al., 1985). in our present study, the dose of 25 mg/pig of
metoclopramide ( - 0.8 mg/kg) that corresponds to the
usual human therapeutic dose reduced the number of
vomits but it was not able to abolish them.  xxxd115xxx  and
 xxxd1927xxx  were ineffective. these results confirm again
that simple reorganization and stimulation of gastrointestinal motility in an anal direction cannot reduce cisplatinevoked emesis. however, our results are compatible with
the findings that high doses of metoclopramide are able to
antagonize 5-ht 3 receptors (fozard and horst, 1982: fozard, 1984) and that blockade of 5-ht~ receptors causes an
antiemetic effect (see below).
it has generally been believed that blockade of dopamine receptors in the striatum may be the basis of the
antiemetic effect (florczyk et al., 1982). in fact, neuroleptic agents have a certain potency to reduce emesis induced
by dopamine receptor agonists (niemegeers, 1982). costall et al. (1987) demonstrated that several neuroleptics
reduced or even attenuated the emetic response to cisplatin. in our studies, sulpiride proved to be weakly effective.
by contrast, haloperidol was without any antiemetic effect, although the doses used were high enough since they
caused definite behavioral changes. results obtained with
 xxxd1927xxx  in ferrets are contradictory. costall et al.
(1987) found that  xxxd1927xxx  inhibits cisplatin-induced
emesis. by contrast, miner et al (1987) reported about the
ineffectiveness of  xxxd1927xxx , in the present study, the
relatively selective  xxxg656xxx  antagonists  xxxd115xxx  and  xxxd1927xxx  were also ineffective on cisplatin-induced emesis in pigs. therefore, our data confirm
that mechanisms other than a simple dopamine receptor
antagonism should be involved in the antiemetic action of
metoclopramide.
evidence has accumulated that 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht) plays a crucial role in the mechanisms underlying
cytotoxic vomiting and nausea (andrews et al., 1988;
mitchelson, 1992). in this context, peripheral and central
sites of action have to be considered. the highest amount
of 5-ht in the body is present in the intestinal mucosa
where it occurs in the enterochromaffin cells. cytotoxic
anticancer drugs are capable of stimulating the release of
5-ht from these cells (see fukui et al., 1993c). this 5-ht,
in turn, activates 5-ht 3 receptors on peripheral endings of
afferent vagal nerves and potentially, or splanchnic nerves,
thus initiating the emetic reflex via so-called vomiting
center in the brain stem. in support of this proposed mechanism, it was found in ferrets, cats, and dogs that after
vagotomy and dissection of splanchnic nerves, cyclophos-

i. szelenyi et al.
emesis induced in domestic pigs

phamide and certain other cytotoxic chemotherapeutics
failed to induce vomiting (miller and nonaka, 1992; fukui
et al., 1993b; kamato et al., 1993). furthermore, evidence
has been presented that i.p. injection of 5-ht 3 receptor
agonists such as 2-methyl-5-ht, phenylbiguanide, and/or
m-chlorophenylbiguanide in ferrets (kamato et al., 1993)
and cats (miller and nonaka, 1992) induced vomiting in a
manner sensitive to blockade by  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists.
in the central nervous system, the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema and the "emetic center" are
considered to be potential sites of action of  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists. high concentrations of 5-ht have been found
in the area postrema (pickel and armstrong, 1984). moreover, 5-ht3 receptors are present at high density in this
brain area (kilpatrick et al., 1989). activation of area
postrema neurons in the chemoreceptor trigger zone is
capable of triggering the vomiting response (borison,
1974). the area postrema, which is highly vascularized, is
located outside the blood brain barrier and, therefore, is
suited to detect emetogenic compounds contained in the
blood (leslie and reynolds, 1991). the highest concentration of 5-ht3 receptors in the brain stem was detected in
the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (nts) (pratt et al.,
1990), suggesting that this nucleus may play a major role
in the mechanisms underlying vomiting and the antiemetic
effect of 5-ht 3 receptor antagonists.
in recent years, the antiemetic property of selective
5-ht 3 receptor antagonists was established by a large
number of experiments in which emesis was induced by
cisplatin and other anticancer treatments. ics 205-930
( xxxd3451xxx ) was shown to inhibit cisplatin-evoked
emesis, inter alia, in ferrets (costall et al., 1986) and
monkeys (fukui et al., 1993a). prevention of cisplatin-induced emesis has also been demonstrated for ondansetron
and zacopride in ferrets (costall et al., 1987; stables et al.,
1987). our present results obtained in domestic pigs with
the 5-ht 3 receptor antagonists mdl 72222,  xxxd3451xxx ,
ondansetron, and zacopride clearly confirmed the antiemetic effect of these drugs and are in close agreement with
data published by others. however, according to our data
in the pig, it should be pointed out that the 2- or even 4-hr
observation periods applied by other investigators in
ferrets may be too short for reliable evaluation of the
emetic responses. such a 2-hr observation time after cisplatin administration to ferrets was applied by costall et
al. (1987) and a 4-hr period was applied by miner et al.
(1987). costall et al. (1987) found that the dose of 0.05
mg/kg zacopride prolonged the latency time of vomiting
and reduced the number of vomits/retches by about 50%
(however, the difference was not statistically significant).
in our study in pigs, the comparable dose of zacopride was
2 mg/pig ( - 0.06 mg/kg). this dose abolished emesis in
the first 2 hr and the emetic response was still reduced
when the observation time was extended to 4 hr; however,

115

in the subsequent 16 hr the number of vomits was rather
increased, leading to an unchanged number of vomits in
the total 24-hr observation period. a similar tendency was
observed with ondansetron at 5 mg/pig ( - 0.16 mg/kg): in
the first 2-hr period, emesis was abolished, thereafter, it
was considerably reduced, but it basically reappeared. in
conclusion, too short an observation period following cisplatin infusion and injection of an antiemetic compound
might result in an overestimation of the activity of latter
drug.
in patients, such anticancer drugs as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide can evoke vomiting and
nausea for up to several hours and days following a single
intravenous injection (kris et al., 1985). our present resuits in domestic pigs are in agreement with the human
data: onset and frequency of emesis induced by cancer
chemotherapeutic agents depend on the drug used. antiemetic drugs have different pharmacokinetic properties.
highly potent and selective  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
with short biological half-life may abolish cisplatin-induced emesis for a short time; however, such an antiemetic
effect might no longer be detectable when it is recorded for
longer time periods after administration of cisplatin or
other chemotherapeutics. an adequate experimental design with a sufficiently long observation period is necessary to detect both emetogenic activity of anticancer drugs
and the antiemetic effect of appropriate drugs.
in summary, our present results suggest that the domestic pig is a suitable, highly sensitive animal for studying
antiemetic effects of drugs in the preclinical development
and clarifying the possible emetogenic potential of new
anticancer agents.
