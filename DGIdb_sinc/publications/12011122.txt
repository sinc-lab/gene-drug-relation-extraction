 xxxd2312xxx  radioimmunotherapy versus
rituximab immunotherapy for patients with relapsed or
refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed b-cell
non-hodgkin’s lymphoma
by thomas e. witzig, leo i. gordon, fernando cabanillas, myron s. czuczman, christos emmanouilides, robin joyce,

pratik multani, and christine a. white
purpose: radioimmunotherapy combines biologic
and radiolytic mechanisms to target and destroy tumor
cells, thus offering a needed therapeutic alternative for
refractory non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl) patients.
this phase iii randomized study compares the novel
radioimmunotherapy yttrium-90 (90y) ibritumomab
tiuxetan with a control immunotherapy, rituximab, in
143 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade,
follicular, or transformed cd20ⴙ transformed nhl.
patients and methods: patients received either a single intravenous (iv) dose of 90y  xxxd2312xxx 
0.4 mci/kg (n ⴝ 73) or rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv weekly
for four doses (n ⴝ 70). the radioimmunotherapy group
was pretreated with two rituximab doses (250 mg/m2)
to improve biodistribution and one dose of indium-111
 xxxd2312xxx  for imaging and dosimetry. the
primary end point, overall response rate (orr), was
assessed by an independent, blinded, lymphoma expert panel.

results: orr was 80% for the 90y  xxxd2312xxx  group versus 56% for the rituximab group (p ⴝ
.002). complete response (cr) rates were 30% and 16%
in the 90y  xxxd2312xxx  and rituximab groups,
respectively (p ⴝ .04). an additional 4% achieved an
unconfirmed cr in each group. kaplan-meier estimated
median duration of response was 14.2 months in the
90
y  xxxd2312xxx  group versus 12.1 months in
the control group (p ⴝ .6), and time to progression was
11.2 versus 10.1 months (p ⴝ .173) in all patients.
durable responses of > 6 months were 64% versus 47%
(p ⴝ .030). reversible myelosuppression was the primary toxicity noted with 90y  xxxd2312xxx .
conclusion: radioimmunotherapy with 90y  xxxd2312xxx  is well tolerated and produces statistically and clinically significant higher orr and cr compared with rituximab alone.

herapeutic options are limited in the treatment
of relapsed or refractory, low-grade, follicular, or
transformed non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl). almost all
patients relapse, regardless of the regimen used, and no
single therapy shows definitive value in increasing survival
for this patient population. thus, in the absence of a curative
therapy, a new agent that reduces tumor burden and conveys
a prolonged, treatment-free period would be valuable.
radioimmunotherapy with yttrium-90 (90y) ibritumomab
tiuxetan (zevalin; idec pharmaceuticals, san diego, ca)
is a novel treatment that combines immunotherapeutic and
radiation mechanisms. this is the first randomized phase iii
study to compare the efficacy and safety of a radiolabeled
monoclonal antibody (90y  xxxd2312xxx ) with those
of an unlabeled monoclonal antibody (rituximab).
rituximab (rituxan; genentech, south san francisco,
ca, and idec pharmaceuticals, san diego, ca), the
anti-cd20 chimeric monoclonal antibody that was a control
in this study, is a frequently used therapy in the relapsed and
refractory nhl patient population. an immunoglobulin (ig)
g1 kappa monoclonal antibody, rituximab has mouse variable and human constant regions. in vitro studies have

demonstrated that rituximab binds human complement
through the fc portion of the antibody and lyses lymphoid
b-cell lines through complement-dependent cytotoxicity
and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.1 this
chimeric antibody targets the  xxxg1445xxx , which is an
ideal target for immunotherapy of b-cell nhl because it is

expressed in most cases of nhl and on normal b lymphocytes but not on stem cells, plasma cells, or nonhematopoietic tissues. in addition, the  xxxg1445xxx  does not shed
from the cell surface to form free antigen that could
compete with circulating antibody.2,3
rituximab produced responses in approximately 50% of
patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular
nhl when administered as an intravenous (iv) infusion at
a dose of 375 mg/m2 once a week for four doses, with a time
to progression (ttp) in responders of approximately 13
months.4-7 six percent of patients achieved a complete
response (cr) and 44% a partial response (pr). toxicity is
primarily limited to infusion-related events, including fever,
rigors, chills, and, less frequently, nausea, urticaria, fatigue,
headache, pruritus, bronchospasm, tumor-related pain, angioedema, and hypotension and rare instances of tumor
lysis, serious mucocutaneous, and cardiac events.8 in 1997,
rituximab became the first monoclonal antibody to be
approved by the united states food and drug administration for the treatment of cancer.
ibritumomab, the murine igg1 anti-cd20 antibody that is
the parent of the engineered chimeric antibody rituximab,
targets the same epitope on the  xxxg1445xxx . both ibritumomab and rituximab have been shown to have antiproliferative effects in tritiated thymidine incorporation assays
and to induce apoptosis directly.9 in addition to producing
direct cytotoxicity, monoclonal antibodies such as ibritumomab can be used to target radionuclides to specific tumor
cells. radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies are attractive
agents for nhl therapy because lymphoma cells are inherently sensitive to radiation.10-13
ibritumomab can be covalently linked to the mx-dtpa
linker-chelator14 tiuxetan, which provides a high-affinity
chelation site for indium-111 (111in) or 90y. ibritumomab
tiuxetan can chelate with 111in to form 111in ibritumomab
tiuxetan (111in zevalin) or with 90y to form 90y  xxxd2312xxx  (90y zevalin). 90y is a pure beta emitter
with a physical half-life of 64 hours and a maximum energy
of 2.3 mev, resulting in a mean path length of 5 mm in soft
tissue.15,16 the high energy and long beta path length of 90y
may be especially advantageous in treating bulky, poorly
vascularized tumors and tumors with heterogeneous antigen
expression. the characteristics of 90y make it an ideal
radionuclide for effective radioimmunotherapy, delivered
on an outpatient basis.
in two separate phase i and i/ii studies,15,17,18 use of 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  yielded overall response rates (orrs)
of 64% to 67%, with crs of 26% to 28% in patients with
low-grade, intermediate-grade, or mantle-cell nhl and
82% in patients with low-grade nhl. in the phase i/ii
study, the median ttp in responders treated with 0.4

witzig et al

mci/kg was 15.4 months, and the ttp for complete
responders ranged from 28.3 to 36.4⫹ months (median not
yet reached).
the primary goal of the present study was to compare the
orr of patients receiving 90y  xxxd2312xxx  with
that of patients receiving rituximab as a control; response
was evaluated by an independent panel, lymphoma expert’s confirmation of response (lexcor), that was
blinded to the treatment received and to the investigator
assessment of response. secondary goals were to determine
ttp, duration of response (dr), and time to next anticancer
therapy (ttnt) and to confirm that dosimetry is not
necessary for safe administration of 90y  xxxd2312xxx . prognostic factors that could affect response to treatment were analyzed.
patients and methods

patient selection
the protocol required the patients to have histologically confirmed,
relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular or transformed nhl
requiring treatment as determined by an increase in overall tumor size,
the presence of b symptoms, and/or the presence of masses that were
causing ongoing clinical symptomatology. the 143 patients enrolled
were stratified by histology type as nonfollicular low grade (international working formulation type a in this protocol), follicular (international working formulation types b, c, or d, or revised europeanamerican lymphoma classification, follicular grade i, ii, iii),19 or
transformed. to meet eligibility criteria, rituximab-naı̈ve patients had
to have bidimensionally measurable disease ⱖ 3 cm (later amended to
ⱖ 2 cm) by computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance
imaging, had to be at least 18 years old, not pregnant or lactating, and
following accepted birth control methods, had to have a prestudy
performance status of 0, 1, or 2 according to the world health
organization scale, and had to have a life expectancy of ⱖ 3 months.
within 2 weeks before initial treatment, the following were required:
hemoglobin level greater than 8 g/dl, absolute neutrophil count ⱖ
1,500 cells/mm3, platelet count ⱖ 150,000 cells/mm3, total bilirubin
level less than 2.0 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase level less than four
times normal, ast level less than four times normal, and serum
creatinine level less than 2.0 mg/dl. patients were excluded if their
bone marrow biopsy or aspirate demonstrated ⱖ 25% involvement
with nhl, if their peripheral-blood lymphocyte count was greater
than 5,000 cells/mm3, if they had prior external-beam radiation
therapy to more than 25% of their bone marrow, or if they had a
history of human antimurine antibodies (hama) or human antichimeric antibodies (haca).
patients with cns nhl, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle-cell
lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus, prior radioimmunotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors within 2 weeks before treatment,
or prior autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant were not eligible.
there was no limitation on bulky disease or the number of prior
antineoplastic therapies or tumor relapses. all prior chemotherapy was
required to have been completed at least 3 weeks (6 weeks if
nitrosourea or  xxxd2655xxx ) before study treatment. the study was
approved by the institutional review board at each study site, and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

radioimmunotherapy for lymphoma

study design and objectives

statistical methods

this was a prospectively randomized, controlled, phase iii study of
y  xxxd2312xxx  versus rituximab. patients were randomly
assigned to either of two regimens. control patients were to receive
four once-weekly doses of rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv as previously
described.7 90y  xxxd2312xxx  patients were to receive a
regimen of rituximab 250 mg/m2 iv on days 1 and 8, 111in  xxxd2312xxx  (5 mci of 111in, 1.6 mg of  xxxd2312xxx ) iv
(over 10 minutes) on day 1; and 90y  xxxd2312xxx  0.4 mci/kg
iv (over 10 minutes) on day 8 after the day 8 rituximab, as previously
described.18,20 the dose of 90y was capped at 32 mci. the primary
study end point was orr. secondary study end points were dr and
ttp (in all patients and in responders). additional efficacy end points
were cr rate, complete clinical response rate, pr rate, ttnt, and
quality of life. the treatment period was defined as 13 weeks from the
time of the first study drug infusion, and the follow-up period was
defined as a maximum of 4 years in patients with a clinical response.
laboratory studies were to include baseline and follow-up hematology, serum chemistry, igs, haca/hama, blood t- and b-lymphocyte
and natural killer subsets by flow cytometry, and bcl-2 analysis of dna
from blood and marrow cells.21,22 during the treatment period, blood
counts (complete blood count/differential/platelets) were collected
weekly. the functional assessment of cancer therapy–general
(fact-g) survey23 was used to analyze the alleviation or continuation
of symptoms common to nhl.

treatment comparisons for all response variables were analyzed in
the intent-to-treat populations using the cochran-mantel-haenszel test.
all inferential analyses of safety and clinical activity were two-sided
and were performed at the alpha ⫽ 0.05 level. selected prognostic
factors and response variables were evaluated at baseline with fisher’s
exact two-tailed test. treatment differences, adjusted by prognostic
factors, were tested with the cochran-mantel-haenszel test, and the
breslow-day test was used to detect the interaction between prognostic
factor and treatment. stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical response difference between 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  and rituximab when prognostic factors were
included in the model.
secondary efficacy variables were ttp, dr, and ttnt. ttp was
measured from the date of first rituximab treatment to the date of
disease progression, dr from the date of the first observation of
response to the date of disease progression, and ttnt from the date of
the first treatment to the date of new treatment. ttp and ttnt were
evaluated in all patients, and ttp and dr in responders. these
parameters were stratified by histology and analyzed with cox proportional hazard models. estimates of median ttp, dr, and ttnt were
determined using the kaplan-meier estimation method.27 an exploratory analysis evaluated durable response at specific time points.
patients with durable response were defined as responders with ttp
greater than or equal to the specified time period, ie, 6, 9, and 12
months. safety profiles were compared using fisher’s exact test. the
paired t test was used to test for total score difference in the
quality-of-life data (fact-g). b symptom and disease-related symptom changes from baseline data were compared using the wilcoxon
rank sum test. all calculations were performed using sas software
(version 6.12)28 under the idec hewlett packard unix system.
the trial design was powered to detect a 25% higher orr in the 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  group compared with control. given a 0.05 alpha
level, a sample size of 150 patients would yield at least 80% statistical
power. a prospectively defined interim analysis was performed when
efficacy data for the first 90 patients became available.29 these
analyses confirmed a minimum of 80% power to detect a 25% higher
orr in the 90y  xxxd2312xxx  group than in the control group,
with a level of significance of .005 for the interim analysis and .048 for
the final analysis. the trial was not designed to detect a difference in
ttp; the ttp for the 90y  xxxd2312xxx  group was to be
clinically equivalent to that of the control group (⫾ 1.5 months).

dosimetry
imaging and dosimetry were to be conducted at the clinical sites
(methods published elsewhere).24,25 no treatment with 90y  xxxd2312xxx  was to be administered if the predicted delivered dose
of radiation was more than 20 gy to any nontumor organ or more than
3 gy to the bone marrow.

response assessment
a lexcor team of one radiologist and one oncologist measured all
lymph nodes on computed tomography scans of the neck, chest,
abdomen, and pelvis and evaluated clinical information to determine
response. response was assessed according to both protocol-defined
criteria and international workshop nhl response criteria (iwrc) but
is reported here as iwrc because those are the current standards.26 the
investigative site performed response evaluations 1 month after treatment completion. additional response evaluations were to be performed through year 4 or until disease progression. the decision to
initiate lymphoma therapy and the type of treatment after 90y  xxxd2312xxx  or rituximab were determined by patients’ treating
physicians and were not dictated by this study.

safety
safety variables were to include all adverse events within the
13-week treatment period. during follow-up, data were collected on
serious adverse events and on adverse events that were possibly or
probably related or of unknown relationship to study drug. use of
prophylactic growth factors was not permitted, but therapeutic administration of growth factors and/or transfusions to treat cytopenias was to
be at the investigator’s discretion. samples for the analysis of hama
and haca were to be collected at baseline, week 4 (all patients), week
8 (rituximab only), and week 12 (all patients). toxicity was to be
evaluated using the national cancer institute’s adult toxicity criteria
(common toxicity criteria version 2.0).

results

a total of 143 patients from 27 institutions were enrolled
onto the study and treated; 73 were randomized to 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  and 70 to rituximab. patient characteristics were well balanced. there were no statistically
significant differences between treatment groups at baseline
(table 1). all patients had advanced disease with a median
of two prior regimens (range, one to six), including the
following: alkylator treatment with or without prednisone
(28%); cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone (chop) (45%); cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
and prednisone (32%); single-agent purine analogs (15%),
corticosteroids (20%); and other aggressive regimens, including purine analog combinations, dexamethasone, cis-

after patients were stratified by prognostic variables, 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  produced a significantly superior
response compared with rituximab. the orr in the 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  group was higher compared with the
orr in the rituximab control group in patients resistant

(76% v 47%, p ⬍ .001).
stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that
no prognostic factor significantly affected orr. the following factors were included in the model: age, sex,
histology, bone marrow involvement, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, extranodal disease, tumor bulk, number of prior
regimens, international prognostic index score, and bcl-2
status. therefore, the statistical analysis was performed
without adjustment for any prognostic variable, which
resulted in an odds ratio for orr of 2.89 in favor of 90y

immunotherapy for b-cell nhl with the human chimeric
anti-cd20 antibody, rituximab, has been an important
advance in the treatment of b-cell malignancies. the unique
targeting of monoclonal antibodies can be harnessed to
carry radionuclides,31-39 enhancing cytotoxicity to tumor
cells with relative sparing of normal body tissues. radioimmunoconjugates such as 90y  xxxd2312xxx  may
play an important role in the treatment of patients with
b-cell nhl.
although single-arm phase i/ii studies of 90y  xxxd2312xxx  suggested a higher response rate for 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  than for rituximab,15,17,18 this advantage had not yet been demonstrated in a randomized,
controlled study. this is the first study reported in which an
unlabeled monoclonal antibody has been compared with a
radioimmunoconjugate with the same specificity for the
target antigen. results demonstrate that treatment with
90
y-labeled immunotherapy increased the orr from 56%
to 80%, produced a higher rate of crs, and although not
statistically significant, prolonged ttp in follicular and cr
groups. also, time to next therapy was longer in the 90y
 xxxd2312xxx –treated patients. excellent response
rates were achieved in chemoresistant patients, and patient
tolerance was such that this becomes an attractive treatment
strategy for elderly patients who are not acceptable candidates for chemotherapy.

radioimmunotherapy for lymphoma

the patients in this trial had incurable relapsed or
refractory b-cell nhl and were in need of therapy because
of b symptoms, organ dysfunction, pain, and/or rapidly
progressing tumor (see patients and methods). in this
context, a clinically meaningful outcome is a significant
reduction in tumor burden (as evidenced by a pr, complete
clinical response, or cr) and resolution of disease-related
symptoms sustained for a period of time during which
further treatment is not required. as o’shaughnessy et al40
noted, “the primary aim of cancer treatment is prolongation
of life, but the demonstration that a new agent causes tumor
regression and improves patients’ clinical condition also
supports approval of a new agent, even in the absence of
improved survival.”
although the orr was significantly higher in the 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  group compared with the rituximab
control group, this did not translate into a longer ttp (fig
2) in this study. there are several possible explanations for
this finding. first, the trial was not powered to assess
differences in ttp. second, 90y  xxxd2312xxx 
patients had a greater absolute and percent shrinkage in sum
of the product of the perpendicular diameters of measurable
lesions (spd), resulting in patients with small nadir spd
that, on follow-up examinations, met the criteria for progression with minor increases in tumor size. this definition
of disease progression (increase of 50% or more in spd
from nadir)41,42 may explain the more apparent difference in
ttnt relative to ttp. third, a few patients receiving
rituximab who were stable but were treated eventually with
other regimens were not counted as progressions. however,
durable responses of 6 months’ duration were significantly
higher, and at the time of this analysis, there was already a
numerical benefit in durable response at 9 months and at 12
months. ttp was longer in the cr/cru patients treated
with 90y  xxxd2312xxx , which suggests that future
studies of radioimmunotherapy should aim to increase the
cr rate.
this randomized controlled trial offers the opportunity to
distinguish adverse events associated with rituximab, a
naked monoclonal antibody therapy, from those specific to
radioimmunotherapy with 90y  xxxd2312xxx . in
both groups, the majority of nonhematologic adverse events
were grade 1 or 2.
the only significant differences in nonhematologic adverse events were in the digestive and respiratory body
systems. in the digestive system, the primary difference
consisted of a greater incidence of grades 1 and 2 nausea,
vomiting, and anorexia in the 90y  xxxd2312xxx 
group. however, the incidence of digestive system adverse
events considered by the investigator to be possibly related
to the study drug was not statistically different between

2461
groups. the majority of the difference in respiratory system
adverse events was due to an increased incidence of cough
and of dyspnea associated with anemia in the 90y  xxxd2312xxx  group. no long-term pulmonary toxicity
has been reported.
the majority of related grade 3 and 4 toxicities associated
with 90y  xxxd2312xxx  therapy consisted of reversible depletion of one or more hematologic cell lines, which
has been noted to be correlated with percentage of bone
marrow involvement with nhl18 and with the number and
types of prior chemotherapies.
patients were required to have less than 25% marrow
involvement with nhl because of concern about excessive
myelosuppression. this restriction eliminated many patients
with small lymphocytic nhl who typically have bone
marrow extensively involved with nhl. further studies in
small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia are indicated, perhaps after reduction of marrow lymphoma with rituximab or chemotherapy for patients with
more extensive marrow involvement.
there have been other single-arm studies of radioimmunoconjugates for nhl, including studies of iodine-131
(131i)–labeled  xxxd3405xxx ,39,43 131i-labeled anti- xxxg378xxx ,38
and 131i-labeled anti-hla-dr.31 90y has potential advantages for radioimmunotherapy over other 131i. as a highenergy, beta-emitting isotope, 90y delivers higher beta
energy radiation (2.3 mev v 0.6 mev) at a longer path
length (5 mm v 1 mm).44-46 these characteristics may be
especially advantageous in treating bulky, poorly vascularized tumors and tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression. in a mathematical model of tumor curability, the
optimal target diameter and range for 90y were calculated to
be 3.4 cm (range, 2.8 to 4.2 cm) versus 0.34 cm (range, 0.26
to 0.5 cm) for 131i.47 because 90y is a pure beta emitter, 90y
 xxxd2312xxx  can be administered as outpatient
therapy without significant patient restrictions.
90
y  xxxd2312xxx  treatment does not preclude
patients from receiving subsequent chemotherapy. patients
have received subsequent treatment, with therapies such as
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone;  xxxd2120xxx ; dexamethasone, cisplatin, and  xxxd1790xxx ; and etoposide, methylprednisolone,  xxxd1790xxx , and
cisplatin, including five patients who had high-dose treatment with stem-cell or bone marrow transplantation.48
building on the success of single-agent radioimmunotherapy will require further clinical trials. rituximab
immunotherapy is now being combined with multiagent
chemotherapy, and results indicate an improved orr and
overall survival.49 maintenance rituximab after 90y  xxxd2312xxx  or repeat courses of 90y ibritumomab
tiuxetan may prolong dr. 90y  xxxd2312xxx ,

given either before or at the end of induction chemotherapy for low- or intermediate-grade nhl, may be useful,
possibly improving the cr rate and prolonging dr.
radioimmunotherapy may be combined with high-dose
chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue.36 also, further trials
will need to explore retreatment and combined-modality
dose and schedule.

90

y  xxxd2312xxx  radioimmunotherapy is safe
and effective and represents a clinically meaningful advance
in the treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed nhl. the improved orr found in this
randomized study of a radiolabeled antibody versus rituximab lays the foundation for the next generation of radioimmunotherapy clinical trials.
