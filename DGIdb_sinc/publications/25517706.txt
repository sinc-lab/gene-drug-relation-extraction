a bs t r ac t
background

placebo-controlled trials indicate that  xxxd1792xxx , a partial agonist that binds the
 xxxg456xxx  and is used for smoking cessation, almost doubles
the chances of quitting at 6 months. we investigated whether  xxxd1792xxx  was at least
as effective as nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers to quit.
methods

we conducted a pragmatic, open-label, noninferiority trial in new zealand in
which 1310 adult daily smokers who were motivated to quit and called the national quitline were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive  xxxd1792xxx  for 25 days
or nicotine-replacement therapy for 8 weeks.  xxxd1792xxx  was provided by mail, free
of charge, and nicotine-replacement therapy was provided through vouchers for
low-cost patches along with gum or lozenges. low-intensity, telephone-delivered
behavioral support was provided to both groups through the quitline. the primary outcome was self-reported continuous abstinence at 1 month.
results

at 1 month, continuous abstinence from smoking was reported for 40% of participants receiving  xxxd1792xxx  (264 of 655) and 31% of participants receiving nicotinereplacement therapy (203 of 655), for a difference of 9.3 percentage points (95%
confidence interval, 4.2 to 14.5). the effectiveness of  xxxd1792xxx  for continuous abstinence was superior to that of nicotine-replacement therapy at 1 week, 2 months,
and 6 months. in a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary outcome,  xxxd1792xxx  was superior to nicotine-replacement therapy among women and noninferior
among men. self-reported adverse events over 6 months occurred more frequently
in the  xxxd1792xxx  group (288 events among 204 participants) than in the group receiving nicotine-replacement therapy (174 events among 134 participants); adverse
events were primarily nausea and vomiting and sleep disorders.

conclusions

when combined with brief behavioral support,  xxxd1792xxx  was found to be superior
to nicotine-replacement therapy in helping smokers quit smoking, but it was associated with a higher frequency of self-reported adverse events. (funded by the

ytisine is a plant-based alkaloid
found in members of the leguminosae
family.1,2 like varenicline,  xxxd1792xxx  is a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nachrs), with an affinity for the alpha4beta2 receptor
subtype,3 and a half-life of 4.8 hours.4  xxxd1792xxx  is
a generic agent currently manufactured by sopharma as  xxxd1792xxx  and by aflofarm pharma as
desmoxan. it has been available both with and
without prescription for smoking cessation since
the 1960s, largely in eastern europe.5 four systematic reviews report  xxxd1792xxx  to be superior to
placebo for short-term and long-term abstinence.6-9
when taken at the recommended dosage (1.5 to
9 mg per day for 25 days),  xxxd1792xxx  is associated
with no significant increase in adverse events as
compared with placebo (20.5% vs. 19.6%), although gastrointestinal symptoms are more common (11.9% vs. 7.2%).7
 xxxd1792xxx  remains relatively unknown outside
eastern europe despite calls for licensing worldwide10-12 because of its proven benefits, low cost as
compared with other cessation medications ( xxxd1792xxx , $20 to $30 for 25 days; nicotine-replacement therapy, $112 to $685 for 8 to 10 weeks;
varenicline, $474 to $501 for 12 weeks),11 and
low cost per quality-adjusted-life-year.13 given that
no trials have compared  xxxd1792xxx  with nicotinereplacement therapy, we designed a noninferiority
trial to investigate whether  xxxd1792xxx  was at least as
effective as nicotine-replacement therapy. we hypothesized that 25 days of  xxxd1792xxx  plus low-intensity behavioral support would be at least as effective as 8 weeks of nicotine-replacement therapy
plus low-intensity behavioral support for smoking
cessation.

sopharma. the research council, sopharma, and
the extab corporation had no role in the design
of the trial, the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data, or the writing of the report
for publication. the protocol was approved by the
new zealand multi-region ethics committee and
the standing committee on therapeutic trials. all
participants provided oral informed consent. all

participants

this parallel-group, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial was conducted in new zealand.14
the first randomization was conducted on march
29, 2011, and the last follow-up took place on february 4, 2013. smokers were recruited through the
new zealand national quitline. to be included in
the study, participants had to be at least 18 years
of age, daily smokers, and motivated to quit. potential participants were excluded if they were
pregnant or breast-feeding, were taking smokingcessation medication, were enrolled in another
cessation program or study, had self-reported
pheochromocytoma, had a systolic blood pressure
above 150 mm hg, a diastolic blood pressure
above 100 mm hg, or both, had schizophrenia, or
had had a self-reported cardiovascular event in
the 2 weeks before study enrollment.
randomization

eligible participants who had called the quitline
were randomly allocated, by computer, to nicotine-replacement therapy or  xxxd1792xxx  in a 1:1 ratio.
randomization was stratified with the use of
minimization according to sex, ethnicity (maori,
pacific islander, or non-maori and non–pacific
islander), and cigarette dependence, which was
determined by means of the fagerström test of
cigarette dependence, in which smokers were
assigned to one of two groups: those with scores
of 5 or lower, indicating lower dependence, and
those with scores greater than 5, indicating greater
dependence.15,16 participants and researchers collecting outcome data were aware of treatment
allocation.

 xxxd1792xxx  vs. nicotine for smoking cessation

procedures

all participants were offered low-intensity telephone behavioral support (an average of three
calls of 10 to 15 minutes each from quitline advisors over a period of 8 weeks). participants assigned to nicotine-replacement therapy received
vouchers from quitline that were redeemable
from community pharmacies for nicotine patches (in doses of 7 mg, 14 mg, or 21 mg) and for
gum (2 mg or 4 mg) or lozenges (1 mg or 2 mg)
or both gum and lozenges at a cost of nz$3 for
an 8-week supply of each item (the equivalent of
€2, or approximately $2.50 in u.s. dollars). the
type and strength of nicotine-replacement therapy were determined by quitline advisors in accordance with national smoking-cessation guidelines17 and participant preference. the  xxxd1792xxx 
group received a 25-day course of tablets by
courier and were asked to reduce their smoking
at their own pace during the first 4 days of treatment such that they were not smoking at all by
the 5th day (i.e., their “quit date”). participants
followed the manufacturer’s recommended dosing regimen: days 1 through 3, one tablet every
2 hours through the waking day (up to six tablets per day); days 4 through 12, one tablet every
2.5 hours (up to five tablets per day); days 13
through 16, one tablet every 3 hours (up to four
tablets per day); days 17 through 20, one tablet
every 4 to 5 hours (three tablets per day); and
days 21 through 25, one tablet every 6 hours
(two tablets per day). participants in the  xxxd1792xxx 
group also received the vouchers for nicotinereplacement therapy sent to participants in the
nicotine-replacement therapy group. they were
asked to take the  xxxd1792xxx  tablets for 25 days. if
they had not stopped smoking by that time, or if
they required ongoing support to refrain from
smoking after that time, they were to redeem the
vouchers for nicotine-replacement therapy.
at baseline, data were collected on demographics, smoking history, concomitant medication, motivation to quit smoking (with a score
of 1 indicating very low motivation and a score
of 5 indicating very high motivation), symptoms of
withdrawal and the urge to smoke (both assessed
with the mood and physical symptoms scale, with
symptoms rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating none and 5 the most severe, and the urge

n engl j med 371;25

to smoke scored on a scale of 0 to 10, with
higher scores indicating greater strength of the
urge to smoke and a greater duration of these
urges),18 alcohol use (assessed with the alcohol
use disorders identification test [audit-c],
rated on a scale of 0 to 12, with higher scores
indicating a greater risk of alcohol dependence),19 and satisfaction with smoking (assessed with the modified cigarette evaluation
questionnaire, which included 12 subscales; in
each subscale, a score of 1 indicated not at all
satisfied and a score of 7 indicated extremely
satisfied).20
the primary outcome was continuous abstinence from smoking (self-reported abstinence
since quit day, with an allowance for smoking
a total of five cigarettes or less,21 including during the previous 7 days) 1 month after quit day.
secondary outcomes assessed at 1 week and at
1, 2 and 6 months after quit day were self-reported treatment compliance (total number of  xxxd1792xxx  tablets taken or the type, strength, and
amount of nicotine-replacement therapy used);
alcohol use19; motivation to quit; symptoms of
tobacco withdrawal; and the strength of urges
to smoke and the duration of these urges18;
7-day point prevalence for abstinence (no cigarettes, not a single puff, in the previous 7 days)21;
continuous abstinence; smoking satisfaction20;
concomitant medication; and, if still smoking,
date returned to daily smoking and the number
of cigarettes smoked per day. self-reported adverse events were recorded at each follow-up
call, coded in accordance with the international
statistical classification of diseases and related health
problems, tenth revision, australian modification, and classified by a medical practitioner as
nonserious or serious (defined as death, lifethreatening, hospitalization, or otherwise medically important) and according to severity (mild
— awareness of event but easily tolerated; moderate — discomfort extensive enough to cause
some interference with usual activity; or severe
— inability to carry out usual activity). all adverse events were reviewed by an independent
data safety and monitoring committee. at 1 week
and 1 month we also asked participants in the
 xxxd1792xxx  group whether they would recommend
 xxxd1792xxx  as a cessation aid.

at initial assessment, the main reasons for ineligibility were current use of
other smoking-cessation products or services (71%), schizophrenia (9%),
uncontrolled blood pressure (9%), and pregnancy or breast-feeding (8%).
for the 1-month analysis, protocol violations (as defined in the study) included loss to follow-up, death, and study withdrawal. nrt denotes nicotine-replacement therapy.

for our sample of 1310 people (655 per group),
we assumed a loss of 20% to follow-up and a
power of 90% at the one-sided significance level
of 0.025 (the equivalent of a two-sided significance level of 0.05) to detect a 5% difference in
1-month quit rates between groups. the 1-month
quit rate in the  xxxd1792xxx  group was assumed to
be 55%, midway between the estimate of 60%
for varenicline8 and 50% for nicotine-replacement therapy.22 a noninferiority margin of
difference between the group proportions was
set at 5%.
analyses were performed with sas software,
version 9.3 (sas institute), and were guided by a
prespecified plan. noninferiority for the primary
outcome was evaluated by observing whether the
lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence
intervals for the risk difference in quit rates between the groups was above the noninferiority
limit of −5. the primary analyses were carried
out on an intention-to-treat basis (participants
for whom outcomes were missing were assumed
to be smoking). in the case that noninferiority
was evident, assessment as to whether  xxxd1792xxx 
had effectiveness superior to that of nicotinereplacement therapy was carried out according
to the same approach but was compared with a
zero difference. per-protocol analyses excluded
participants who had missing data at 1 month or
who had major protocol violations (e.g., death,
pregnancy, withdrawal from the study, loss to
follow-up, or noncompliance). compliance in
the  xxxd1792xxx  group was defined as having taken
80% or more of the required number of tablets
within 1 month after the quit date (i.e., 80 tablets
or more). compliance in the nicotine-replacement therapy group was defined as having used
nicotine-replacement therapy at both 1 week and
1 month after the quit date. participants with missing data were assumed to be noncompliant with
the study regimen. complete case analysis was
also undertaken, and quit rates, relative risk, risk
difference, and the number needed to treat were
calculated. treatment groups were compared with
the use of chi-square tests and unadjusted and
adjusted logistic regression modeling (adjusting
for minimization factors and education).
in prespecified subgroup analyses, the consistency of effects was assessed with tests for heterogeneity for the primary outcome according to

ethnicity (maori vs. non-maori), age (<40 years
of age vs. ≥40 years of age), sex, and level of education (<12 years of schooling or no qualification vs. ≥12 years of schooling), type of cigarettes
smoked (factory-made only, roll-your-own only,
or factory-made and roll-your-own), and baseline
audit-c score (high vs. low). post hoc subgroup
analyses for the primary outcome were undertaken according to baseline level of cigarette dependence and use of nicotine-replacement therapy
in the preceding 12 months. the change from
baseline in symptoms of tobacco withdrawal (for
abstainers), audit-c score, and number of cigarettes smoked per day over time was assessed by
means of repeated-measures mixed models adjusted for baseline value. kaplan–meier curves,
the log rank test, and cox proportional hazards
regression analysis were used to measure time
to first lapse from quit date (return to daily
smoking).

outcomes

among 3001 people assessed, 1310 were eligible
for study participation and underwent randomization, 655 in each group (fig. 1). loss to follow-up at 1 month was 12% in both groups
(fig. 1). baseline characteristics were evenly balanced between the treatment groups (table 1;
and table s1 in the supplementary appendix,
available at nejm.org).
 xxxd1792xxx  was not only noninferior to nicotinereplacement therapy but had superior effectiveness: 1-month continuous abstinence rates were
significantly higher in the  xxxd1792xxx  group (40%,
264 of 655) than in the nicotine-replacement
therapy group (31%, 203 of 655) (risk difference,
9.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval
[ci], 4.2 to 14.5; number needed to treat, 11)
(table 2). complete case and per-protocol analyses revealed similar findings (table 2). adjusted
logistic-regression analysis produced an odds
ratio of 1.5 for abstinence with  xxxd1792xxx  (95% ci,
1.2 to 1.9; p = 0.003). prespecified analyses conducted according to sex showed a significantly
higher 1-month continuous abstinence rate with
 xxxd1792xxx  in women and showed no significant
difference (noninferiority) in men (p = 0.011 for
heterogeneity), with no significant differences

noted for other subgroups (fig. s1 in the supplementary appendix). the secondary cessation outcomes at 1 week and at 1, 2, and 6 months were
consistent with the primary outcome, with the
exception of 6-month, 7-day point-prevalence abstinence rates (which were not statistically significant) (table 2).
at 1 week, 66% (392 of 596) of participants in
the nicotine-replacement therapy group were using nicotine-replacement therapy obtained through
the voucher system as compared with 4% (26 of
600) in the  xxxd1792xxx  group. in the  xxxd1792xxx  group,
at 1 week after the quit date, 63 tablets should
have been taken, but participants reported taking
a mean (±sd) of 49±24 tablets. at 1 month after
the quit date, all 100 tablets should have been
taken, but participants reported taking a mean
of 72±34 tablets. overall, 53% (344 of 655) of
participants were in compliance with the guidelines for  xxxd1792xxx  treatment (i.e., they had taken
80 or more tablets), whereas 67% (437 of 655) in
the nicotine-replacement therapy group were in
compliance with treatment guidelines (i.e., they
had used nicotine-replacement therapy at both
1 week and 1 month). at 1 month after the quit
date, 22% of participants in the  xxxd1792xxx  group

§	this population excluded the same participants as described directly above, but protocol violations also included noncompliance with treatment.
¶	point-prevalence abstinence at 1 week is lower than continuous abstinence at 1 week because the definition of continuous abstinence allows

discussion
 xxxd1792xxx  was superior to nicotine-replacement
therapy for smoking cessation among dependent
smokers motivated to quit. self-reported adverse
events over 6 months were almost twice as common in the  xxxd1792xxx  group than in the nicotinereplacement-therapy group. types of adverse events
in the  xxxd1792xxx  group were similar to those seen
in previous placebo-controlled trials of  xxxd1792xxx .6-9
our trial was neither large enough nor long
enough to assess the occurrence of uncommon
adverse events or those with a long time to onset. compliance with allocated treatment was
modest. time to relapse was delayed in the  xxxd1792xxx  group. during treatment, participants in the
 xxxd1792xxx  group reported fewer symptoms of tobacco withdrawal, found smoking less rewarding,
and reduced the number of cigarettes smoked per
day. the higher quit rate observed in women
taking  xxxd1792xxx  has not been previously reported
in studies of nachr partial agonists. this finding could be the result of chance (since data were
not adjusted for multiplicity) but warrants further investigation, since several reviews of nicotine-replacement therapy have reported lower quit
rates in women than in men,23,24 possibly as a result of biologic and psychosocial differences.
we chose a noninferiority design on the basis

*	in the  xxxd1792xxx  group, compliance was defined as having taken 80% or more
of the required number of tablets within 1 month after the quit date (i.e., 80
or more tablets). in the nrt group, compliance was defined as having used
nrt at 1 week and 1 month after the quit date. it was assumed that participants with missing data were not compliant.
†	a serious event was defined as death, a life-threatening event, an event requiring hospitalization, or otherwise medically important event (i.e., the
event does not belong in any of the other categories but may jeopardize the
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent the occurrence of one or more other serious adverse events).
‡	the categories are mutually exclusive.
§	there were two deaths: one participant in the  xxxd1792xxx  group died from alcohol-related asphyxiation during the treatment period, and one in the nrt
group died of a heart attack during follow-up.
¶	this event was development of a brain tumor.

twenty-one percent of participants in the  xxxd1792xxx  group and 34% of participants in the nrt group did not quit on the quit date (day 0). time to relapse was defined as the number of days to return to regular (daily) smoking of cigarettes. in the  xxxd1792xxx  group, the median time to relapse was
significantly longer among those who complied with treatment (177 participants) than among those who did not (171 participants): 127 days (95% ci,
62 to unable to estimate) versus 20 days (95% ci, 8 to 25); p<0.001 by the

trial populations recruited through quitline.30-32
the trial was pragmatic, with broad entry criteria.
the criteria for exclusion on the basis of medical
conditions reflected the manufacturer’s precautions for the use of  xxxd1792xxx  and quitline’s policy
regarding contraindications for nicotine-replacement therapy. as a precaution, we excluded people who reported that they had schizophrenia,
given  xxxd1792xxx ’s similarity to varenicline (which has
a boxed warning related to severe mental health
problems). users of noncigarette tobacco products were not excluded but were probably few in
number given that such products are rarely used
in new zealand and that the sale of snus (a moist
tobacco powder that is placed under the upper
lip) is illegal. we followed the manufacturer’s

recommended dosing regimen for  xxxd1792xxx , although we are not aware of any published studies that support the regimen.
our study had several limitations. first, since
researchers were aware of treatment allocation,
there may have been a reporting bias in favor of
 xxxd1792xxx . second, although adverse events were
medically reviewed, they were self-reported. the
higher proportion of adverse events in the  xxxd1792xxx  group may be due to reporting bias, since the
known side effects of nicotine-replacement therapy could have been regarded as “normal” by
participants in the nicotine-replacement therapy
group who had previously received such therapy
and could therefore have gone unreported. we
did not collect long-term safety data; in the
placebo-controlled trial by west et al.,25 adverse
events reported during a 12-month follow-up
period were predominantly related to gastrointestinal effects. third, because participants were
unlikely to have prior knowledge of  xxxd1792xxx ,
some of the treatment effect might be explained
by its novelty. fourth, verification of self-reported abstinence was not undertaken owing to both
the broad geographic dispersal of the study
population and budget constraints. in addition,
at 1 month participants in the nicotine-replacement-therapy group would have received positive
test results for cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine,
even if they were not smoking. abstinence rates
may therefore be overreported or underreported
(see the supplementary appendix for an estimate of validated abstinence), but there should
not be a difference in the nature of reporting
between groups. fifth, smokers who call quitline may be more motivated to quit than other
populations of smokers.33 sixth, the treatment
periods for the two interventions were different;
the selection of a 1-month primary outcome
should help to ensure comparability. there was
also a between-group difference in participants’
access to treatments (i.e.,  xxxd1792xxx  was delivered
free, whereas nicotine-replacement therapy was
obtained from a pharmacy at a small cost). in a
previous trial with 1410 participants in which
the same recruitment method was used, participants were randomly assigned either to receive
free delivery of nicotine-replacement therapy by
courier or to use of the voucher system.31 no
between-group differences in continuous absti-

 xxxd1792xxx  vs. nicotine for smoking cessation

nence at 3 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months were
observed.
the trial shows that  xxxd1792xxx  is an effective
smoking-cessation aid for use as a first-line treatment for tobacco dependence. the most common adverse events were nausea and vomiting
and sleep disorders. the effect sizes in this trial
were similar to those observed in a trial of varen­
icline versus nicotine-replacement therapy.34 given the large difference in the market prices of
varenicline and  xxxd1792xxx ,11 a head-to-head, noninferiority trial that includes cost-effectiveness
analyses is justified.
