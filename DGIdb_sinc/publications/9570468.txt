1. introduction
5-ht receptor agonists and antagonists modulate in a
complex manner the cataleptogenic effect of dopamine d 2
receptor antagonists in rats. thus, serotonin re-uptake inhibitors such as citalopram, cgp 6085, clomipramine or
 xxxd3555xxx  have been consistently found to enhance
catalepsy provoked by haloperidol or raclopride

with the forepaws on the wooden block, without a deliberate move to step down, was determined. three consecutive
attempts to place the rat onto the wooden block were made
at each time point with the longest latency taken as the

2.4. compounds
 xxxd2511xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx  were purchased from rbi,
whilst all other compounds were synthesised at novartis. it
should be noted that mdl 100,151 is the racemate of

mdl 100,151 žthe racemic mixture containing the žq.-enantiomer known as mdl 100,907; sorensen et al., 1993;
arnt, 1996., fananserin žrp 62203; malgouris et al., 1993.
and the novel  xxxg1115xxx  selective antagonist, sb
200646a žkennett et al., 1994. for their cataleptogenic
activity per se and for their ability to influence catalepsy
induced by  xxxd2511xxx .
the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine has high
affinity for 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors žmeltzer et al.,
1989; coward, 1992.. according to one theory, the absence of dopamine d 2 receptor-mediated catalepsy with
clozapine, is due to its concomitant potent  xxxg1113xxx 
blockade žmeltzer et al., 1989; meltzer, 1995.. in the
present experiments all three  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists
unexpectedly induced a cataleptic response. in order to
learn more about the mode of action of clozapine, it was
therefore tested whether the catalepsy induced by mdl
100,151 would be susceptible to inhibition by clozapine. in
view of the variable effects obtained with mixed 5ht2a r5-ht2c receptor antagonists and the consistent
cataleptogenic responses with selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists, it was also tested whether the  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonist sb 200646a would inhibit the response to
mdl 100,151.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male wistar rats ž220–250 g. were housed in groups of
5 with food and water freely available.
2.2. experimental procedure
catalepsy was measured at t s 0, 0.5, 1 h and then at
hourly intervals up to 5 h in a quiet, dimly lit laboratory.

similar results were obtained with the selective 5-ht2c
receptor antagonist, sb 200646a ž10 mgrkg, fig. 3.. in
contrast, the three putatively selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists, mdl 100,151, fananserin and  xxxd2419xxx  were
clearly cataleptogenic under the present test conditions.
thus,  xxxd2419xxx  dose-dependently increased catalepsy
scores at doses between 0.1 and 3 mgrkg žfig. 4..
fananserin ž3 mgrkg. was also clearly cataleptogenic
žfig. 5., although tested at only one dose due to a limited
availability of compound. mdl 100,151 provoked significant catalepsy at the doses of 0.3–3 mgrkg with the
maximum response occurring at 1 mgrkg žfig. 6; top

many  xxxg1108xxx  agonists differ markedly in their
intrinsic agonist activity and, depending on the test used,
the same compound can appear as an agonist, partial
agonist or ‘silent’ antagonist žfletcher et al., 1993; assié
and koek, 1996.. as described in section 1, 5-ht1a
receptor agonists, including those with relatively low intrinsic activity, invariably have been found to inhibit the
cataleptic response induced by dopamine receptor antagonists. way-100635 is the first selective  xxxg1108xxx 
antagonist which lacks partial agonist activity even in
models with a high receptor reserve žforster et al., 1995;
assie´ and koek, 1996.. since partial agonists are anti-

mdl 100,907 žsorensen et al., 1993., which is the active
žq.-enantiomer.
way-100635 and gr 127935 were dissolved in
physiological saline. mdl 100,151,  xxxd2511xxx ,  xxxd2419xxx 
and clozapine were dissolved in a small volume of 0.2 ml
acetic acid ž10%. and further diluted with physiological
saline. sb 200646a and fananserin were dissolved in
n-methylpyrrolidone and diluted with h 2 o. in combination experiments, drugs were administered consecutively,
at t s 0 min.

cataleptic, the observation that the silent  xxxg1108xxx 
antagonist, way-100635, caused catalepsy may not be,
therefore, too surprising. to our knowledge, such an observation has not, however, been reported previously. admittedly, the doses of way-100635 required are certainly at
the high end of the dose range that has been found to
inhibit the behavioural or endocrine response to selective
 xxxg1108xxx  agonists žan id50 of 0.01 mgrkg has
been found for inhibition of the 8-oh-dpat induced
behavioural syndrome in rats and guinea-pigs, for example.. on the other hand, even at 100-fold higher doses
way-100635 maintains its selectivity žforster et al., 1995;
table 1.. it is conceivable that full  xxxg1108xxx  occupation is required for the induction of catalepsy, hence,
explaining why even low efficacy  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, such as ipsapirone, are consistently anticataleptic
žsee section 1..

tained with  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists are conflicting žsee
section 1.. antagonists which discriminate between 5-ht2a
and 5-ht2c receptors have only recently become available. surprisingly, the first compound in this class,  xxxd2419xxx  evoked a clear-cut and dose-dependent catalepsy
at doses between 0.1 and 3 mgrkg žfig. 4.. however,
 xxxd2419xxx  also has considerable affinity for the a 1-adrenoceptor žsee table 1. and since the classical a 1-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx  is weakly cataleptic žunpublished
results., a role for a 1-adrenoceptors in the response to
 xxxd2419xxx  cannot be entirely excluded. fananserin ž3
mgrkg., like  xxxd2419xxx  evoked a cataleptic response in
the present experiments. however, as with  xxxd2419xxx , an
influence of a 1-adrenoceptor blockade cannot be ruled out
žsee table 1.. in addition, though initially considered to be
more selective than  xxxd2419xxx  žsee also table 1. its selectivity has been recently compromised by the discovery of
its high affinity for dopamine d4 receptors žheuillet et al.,
1996.. the consequence of  xxxg658xxx  blockade with respect to the induction of catalepsy is unknown,
although the selective  xxxg658xxx  antagonists, l-745,870
and u-101397 are reported to be without cataleptogenic
potential at doses thought to fully occupy d4 receptors
žmerchant et al., 1996; bristow et al., 1997..
perhaps the best pharmacological tool to test the influence of  xxxg1113xxx  blockade is mdl 100,907, a
compound which displays high potency to the 5-ht2a site
žp k d 9.1. and 100-fold selectivity over the 5-ht2c site
žkehne et al., 1996.. in addition, the selectivity vis-a-vis
`
other receptors such as the a 1-adrenoceptor, the dopamine
d4 or d 2 receptor subtypes is even larger žp k d values of
6.8, 6.3 and 5.6., respectively žpalfreyman et al., 1993;
kehne et al., 1996.. in the present experiments, mdl
100,151, which is the racemate with mdl 100,907 as the
active enantiomer, was used. the racemic compound essentially retained its pharmacological selectivity žsee table
1.. mdl 100,151 induced cataleptic responses at 0.3, 1
and 3 mgrkg. this result is at variance with sorensen et
al. ž1993., who reported that mdl 100,907 was ineffective
at 1 mgrkg. whether the use of the active enantiomer,
rather than the racemate explains the discrepancy in results, is presently unknown. the most parsimonious conclusion from the experiments, using three different 5-ht2a

205

receptor antagonists, is that central  xxxg1113xxx  blockade leads to a cataleptic response. inspection of figs. 4–6
shows that the onset of cataleptic activity, compared to a
standard neuroleptic drug like  xxxd2511xxx , is slower, with
maximal effects seen towards the end of the 5 h observation period. this may be one explanation why a cataleptic
response to  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists has not been
noted before. again it must be stated that the doses at
which the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists produced catalepsy
are relatively high. for instance, blockade of central 5-ht2a
receptors in rats by mdl 100,907, quantified as inhibition
of 5-htp-induced head twitches, was achieved at doses of
approximately 0.1 mgrkg žkehne et al., 1996.. similar to
the situation with the  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, catalepsy
may be seen only after complete occupation of 5-ht2a
receptors.
the absence of extrapyramidal side effects with clozapine has been ascribed to its high 5-ht2a antagonist activity
relative to its affinity for d 2 receptors žmeltzer et al.,
1989.. in the literature this possibility has been questioned
žcasey, 1993; kapur, 1996.. the present results obtained
with  xxxd2419xxx , fananserin and mdl 100,151 are also
inconsistent with this hypothesis. in addition,  xxxd2511xxx  and
olanzapine have quite similar 5-ht2a rd 2 receptor affinity
ratios as clozapine, yet clozapine inhibits the cataleptic
response to  xxxd2511xxx , olanzapine žkalkman et al., 1997.
and mdl 100,151. these observations provide a strong
argument against the idea that  xxxg1113xxx  blockade is
the explanation for clozapine’s low eps profile. the argument is further reinforced by the observation that mdl
100,151 at a high, and only weakly cataleptic dose ž0.3
mgrkg. failed to modify the catalepsy induced by  xxxd2511xxx .
whereas both clozapine and its n-desmethyl metabolite, norclozapine, have high affinity for 5-ht2 receptors,
norclozapine is slightly  xxxg1115xxx -selective vis-a-vis
`
5-ht2a receptors žkuoppamaki
¨ et al., 1993.. these authors suggested that, while attempting to explain the low
eps liability of clozapine, the interaction with the 5-ht2c
receptor should not be dismissed. fox and brotchie ž1996.
have used norclozapine in locomotion experiments in rats
and suggested that ‘‘ xxxg1115xxx  antagonists may have
a potential as treatment for parkinsons disease’’. however,
the  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, sb 200646a, at a dose
ž10 mgrkg. which is capable of blocking  xxxg1115xxx -mediated responses žkennett et al., 1994. did not induce catalepsy when tested alone or alter  xxxd2511xxx -induced
catalepsy. it therefore seems unlikely that  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonism influences cataleptogenic mechanisms but other
 xxxg1115xxx  antagonists need to be tested before a
final conclusion can be made.
the selective  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist, gr 127935
ž1 mgrkg. neither provoked a cataleptic response, nor did
it affect  xxxd2511xxx -induced catalepsy. the dose used for
these experiments can be considered sufficient to block
 xxxg1109xxx -mediated responses. in guinea-pigs, hy-

pothermia induced by stimulation of central 5-ht1b ž5ht1d b . receptors, was blocked by gr 127935 at oral
doses between 0.1 and 1 mgrkg žskingle et al., 1994.. in
neurochemical studies in guinea-pigs, gr 127935 ž0.1–1
mgrkg, i.p.. significantly increased 5-ht metabolism in
forebrain regions žhutson et al., 1995., whilst the reduction in extracellular 5-ht induced by a 5-ht1 receptor
agonist was abolished by gr 127935 at a dose of 0.05
mgrkg žskingle et al., 1995.. hypophagia in rats induced
with the  xxxg1109xxx  agonist, ru 24969, was blocked
by gr 127935 ž1 mgrkg s.c.; hartley et al., 1995.. thus,
the lack of effect against  xxxd2511xxx -induced catalepsy suggests that this response is not susceptible to central 5-ht1b
receptor blockade. some uncertainty has arisen recently
with respect to the intrinsic activity of gr 127935, since it
was found that in cells which expressed the human recombinant  xxxg1109xxx , gr 127935 induced an agonist
response žwatson et al., 1996; zgombick et al., 1996..
clearly, other selective and truly ‘silent’  xxxg1109xxx 
antagonists need to be tested.
the present experiments were performed with the aim
of learning more about the mechanisms of action of clozapine by using antagonists selective for  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx 
subtypes for which clozapine has significant affinity.
clozapine also binds with moderate affinity to other 5-ht
receptors such as  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 žroth et al., 1994. and
it has been speculated that this could contribute to its
unique antipsychotic profile. unfortunately, selective  xxxg1119xxx 
or 5-ht7 receptor antagonists have still to be disclosed.
taking the present and previous findings together, a
remarkably consistent picture emerges: whilst 5-ht1a and
 xxxg1113xxx  agonists are anticataleptic, high doses of a
selective 5-ht1a and  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists induce a
cataleptic response. in contrast, 5-ht2c and 5-ht1b receptors seem to have little influence on cataleptogenic mechanisms. most importantly though, the results indicate that
the strong anticataleptic effect of clozapine is probably not
caused by blockade of either 5-ht1a , 5-ht1b , 5-ht2a or
5-ht2c receptors. in this respect it may be worth mentioning that the anticataleptic effect of clozapine can neither be
ascribed to an agonist effect at 5-ht1a receptors žbartoszyk et al., 1996..
