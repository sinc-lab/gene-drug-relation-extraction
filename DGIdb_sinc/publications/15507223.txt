abstract
we examined the effect of  xxxd3509xxx , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) and serotonin 1a (5-ht1a) receptor agonist
[bartoszyk, g.d., hegenbart, r., ziegler, h., 1997. emd 68843, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with selective presynaptic  xxxg1108xxx 
agonistic properties. eur. j. pharmacol. 322, 147-153.], on change in affect following predator stress.  xxxd3509xxx  and vehicle injection
(intraperitoneal) occurred either 10 min after predator stress (prophylactic testing), or 90 min prior to behavioral testing for the effects of
predator stress (therapeutic testing). predator stress involved unprotected exposure of rats to a domestic cat. behavioral effects of stress were
evaluated with hole board, plus-maze, and acoustic startle tests 1 week after stress. predator stress increased anxiety-like behavior in the plusmaze and elevated response to acoustic startle. in prophylactic testing,  xxxd3509xxx  affected stress potentiation of startle at doses above 5 mg/
kg.  xxxd3509xxx  increased stress elevation of startle  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg. higher doses of  xxxd3509xxx  (20 and 40 mg/kg) blocked stress potentiation of
startle. in contrast,  xxxd3509xxx  had no effect on stress potentiation of anxiety in the plus-maze. in therapeutic testing,  xxxd3509xxx  increased
stress elevation of startle at all doses. in contrast, therapeutic  xxxd3509xxx  had no effect on stress potentiation of anxiety in the plus-maze.
taken together, the data suggest a prophylactic potential for  xxxd3509xxx  in the treatment of changes in hypervigilance following severe stress.

1. introduction
long-term changes in rodent affect may be produced by
a brief unprotected exposure of male rats to an inquisitive,
but not predatory, adult male cat (predator stress). such
exposures produce long-lasting changes in behavior (up to 3
weeks) indicative of increased fearfulness in several tests of
rodent anxiety-like behavior (adamec, 1997; adamec and
shallow, 1993; cohen et al., 1999, 2000, 2003). it has been
argued that the nature of the behavioral response to predator
stress models the hyperarousal, anxiety, and vulnerability
aspects of human posttraumatic stress disorder (adamec,
1997, 1998; cohen et al., 2003).

selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) reuptake inhibitors (ssris), when given chronically, are effective in ameliorating many of the symptoms of posttraumatic
stress disorder, including hyperarousal and anxiety (friedman, 1997; van der kolk, 2001). it is unknown, however, if
reuptake inhibition of serotonin might have prophylactic
efficacy when given shortly after a traumatic stress on later
affective pathology. the predator stress model may be used,
however, to address such questions preclinically. for
example, cckb, but not ccka, receptor antagonists given
30 min after predator stress block the long-term effects of
predator stress on anxiety in rats (adamec et al., 1997).
the present study was designed to examine the question
of possible prophylactic efficacy of a  xxxd3509xxx  (emd
68843; (5-{4-[4-(5-cyano-3-indolyl)-butyl]-1-piperazinyl}benzofuran-2-carboxamide hydrochloride salt), a novel

ssri that also stimulates serotonin 1a (5-ht1a) autoreceptors (bartoszyk et al., 1997). in addition, the therapeutic
potential of acute administration of this compound against
the effects of predator stress on rodent anxiety-like behavior
was investigated. recent work suggests a selective anxiolytic potential of acutely administered  xxxd3509xxx  in two
of three tests of rodent anxiety-like behavior. anxiolytic-like
effects of  xxxd3509xxx  are seen in the reduction of rat
ultrasonic vocalizations (bartoszyk et al., 1997), a reduction
in defensive burying, but there were no effects on open arm
exploration in the elevated plus-maze (treit et al., 2001).
the action of  xxxd3509xxx  on ultrasonic vocalizations
appears mediated by the 5-hta receptor agonist properties
of  xxxd3509xxx  . the reduction of rat ultrasonic vocalizations
produced by  xxxd3509xxx  is blocked by the potent 5-ht1a
receptor antagonist, carbonyl-11c]n-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-n-(2-pyridyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide (way 100635) (bartoszyk et al., 1997).
in the present design, rats were exposed to a cat and
effects of the exposure on plus-maze and acoustic startle
were tested 1 week later. two tests of anxiety-like behavior
were included because  xxxd3509xxx  effects on anxiety appear
to be test specific, and because predator stress changes
response to both startle and elevated plus-maze (adamec,
1997; adamec et al., 1999a,b). prophylactic potential was
assessed by injecting  xxxd3509xxx  intraperitoneally 10 min
after predator stress and 1 week before behavior testing.
prior work with cckb receptor blockers has shown that
lasting aftereffects of predator stress are still vulnerable to
blockade at least 30 min after cat exposure (adamec et al.,
1997). ten minutes was selected as the earliest time point to
give the injection and still have some drug effect, which
peaks at 90 min after injection (bartoszyk, unpublished
observations). because of the 90-min peak effect property of
 xxxd3509xxx , therapeutic potential was assessed by injecting
 xxxd3509xxx  90 min prior to behavior testing, which occurred
1 week after predator stress.
since increases in anxiety-like behavior are expected
following predator stress, one would expect  xxxd3509xxx  to
block these increases. based on previous work (treit et al.,
2001), one would not necessarily expect an effect of
 xxxd3509xxx  given therapeutically on behavior in the
elevated plus-maze, although effects of  xxxd3509xxx  following stress might be different than previous works, which did
not use stressed rats. the effects of therapeutic administration of  xxxd3509xxx  on startle, or the prophylactic effects
of  xxxd3509xxx  on response to elevated plus-maze and startle,
are empirical questions.

2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
two hundred eighty male long–evans hooded rats
(charles river canada) were used. rats weighed around

140 g at the time of arrival in the laboratory, and 171.7f0.6
g (meanfs.e.m.) at the start of the experiment. rats were
housed and adapted to the laboratory for 5 days as described
elsewhere (adamec and shallow, 1993). food and water
were available ad libitum and rats were kept on a lights on
(7 a.m.)/lights off (7 p.m.) cycle. during adaptation, rats
were handled five times, once each day.
2.2. groups
rats were randomly assigned to 14 groups of 20 rats.
groups were: control (group 1); exposed to a cat only
(stressed only; group 2); exposed to a cat with vehicle
injection 10 min after cat exposure (stressed prophylactic
vehicle control; group 3); exposed to a cat with
 xxxd3509xxx  injections 10 min after cat exposure (in doses
of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg; groups 4–8 stressed+
prophylactic  xxxd3509xxx ); exposed to a cat with vehicle
injection 90 min prior to behavioral testing 1 week after
cat exposure (stressed therapeutic vehicle control; group
9); exposed to a cat with  xxxd3509xxx  injection 90 min
prior to behavioral testing after cat exposure (in doses of
2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg; groups 10–14 stressed+
therapeutic  xxxd3509xxx ).
2.3. exposure to the cat
after 5 days of handling, stressed experimental groups
were exposed to a cat once for 5 min. method of exposure
and testing environment were as described elsewhere
(adamec and shallow, 1993). the testing environment
was a closed room approximately 56 ft.
cat response to the rats involved approach and sniffing,
with occasional mild attacks. two different cats were used
for all exposures. cats used in the exposures were counterbalanced among all groups. both cats approached the rats
reliably but did not injure them. interactions between cat
and rat were videotaped remotely.
after cat exposure, rats were returned to their home
cages. most rats were left unhandled in their home cages
until the days of behavior testing. the exceptions were the
prophylactic groups. six groups were given either vehicle or
 xxxd3509xxx  intraperitoneally 10 min after the end of the cat
exposure test. they were then returned to their home cages
for 1 week until behavior testing.
2.3.1. behavioral measures during the cat exposure
behavior of the cat in the test situation was videotaped
and later analysed to provide a quantitative measure of the
cat exposure experience among the groups. the cat
behaviors scored from videotape were: latency to approach
and time spent near the rat; latency to sniff and time spent
sniffing the rat; and frequency of pawing and biting. the
floor of the testing environment was divided into foot
squares with masking tape. time spent near the rat was
scored when the cat was within 1 ft of the rat.

r. adamec et al. / european journal of pharmacology 504 (2004) 65–77

response of the rats to cat approach were also monitored.
frequencies of active, passive, and escape defensive
responses were measured as described elsewhere (adamec
and shallow, 1993). weight of the rat (g) was also taken at
the time of the cat exposure. groups did not differ in body
weight at the time of exposure to a cat or during behavior
testing (all f{13,266}v0.22, pn0.50).
2.4. rat anxiety testing
rodent anxiety was assessed in the hole board and
elevated plus-maze tests on 1 day, and in the acoustic startle
test on a separate day. behavior testing commenced 7 days
after cat exposure. the order of hole board/plus-maze and
startle testing was counterbalanced in all groups and took 2
days to complete.
2.4.1. hole board and elevated plus-maze, apparatus, and
testing procedure
the elevated plus-maze test was used to assess rodent
anxiety in all groups. the hole board test was used in
conjunction to provide independent measures of activity and
exploratory tendency (file and wardill, 1975a,b).
testing occurred between 8:25 a.m. and 11:40 a.m.
timing of testing was balanced among all of the groups. the
hole board and plus-maze were kept in the same room,
which was novel to the rats. this room differed from the cat
exposure room, and a cat had never been in this room.
experimenters were hidden from view during the testing.
behavior was videotaped and later analyzed blind from the
tape.
the hole board was a square wooden box, 60 cm on a
side. its wooden walls rose 35 cm above its floor. the floor
of the box was elevated 12 cm above the ground. four
evenly spaced holes (big enough for a rat to poke its head
into one) were drilled in the floor. the holes formed a
square, 14 cm from the walls of the box. the hole board was
painted flat grey. rats were placed by gloved hand into the
center of the hole board at the start of the test.
at the end of the 5-min hole board test, rats were
transferred by gloved hand to the elevated plus-maze. the
plus-maze was a maze of four arms arranged in the shape of
a plus sign. each arm was 10 cm wide and 50 cm long. the
maze was elevated 50 cm above the ground. the four arms
were joined at the center by a 10-cm square platform. two
of the arms opposite each other had a railing 3 cm high
along the edges of the maze (open arms) to raise baseline
levels of exploration of the open arms of the maze (treit et
al., 1993). the other two arms had walls extending 40 cm
above the arm and were open at the top (closed arms). the
entire maze was painted flat grey. at the start of the test, rats
were placed in the center of the maze facing the same open
arm of the maze. at the end of the 5-min plus-maze test, rats
were returned to their home cages by gloved hand.
therapeutic test groups were given an injection of either
vehicle or  xxxd3509xxx  90 min prior to the hole board test.

67

all other groups were tested without injection on the day of
testing.
2.4.2. behavioral measures in the hole board test
six measures were taken from videotape. activity was
scored as frequency of rearing and time spent in motion of
any kind (time active). exploratory tendency was measured
as the number of head dips (placing the snout or head into a
hole in the floor) (file and wardill, 1975b). faecal boli were
also counted. defensiveness in the face of a novel open field
was measured with time near the wall and time in the center
of the hole board. near the wall was scored when all four of
the rats feet were between a line drawn through the four
holes in the floor and the wall of the hole board. time in the
center was scored when all four of the rat’s feet were in the
center of the hole board defined by lines drawn through the
four holes in the floor.
2.4.3. behavioral measures in the plus-maze test
a variety of measures were taken from videotape.
several commonly used measures of rodent anxiety-like
behavior were taken. two measures assessed open arm
avoidance in the plus-maze. one was ratio time, defined as
the time spent in the open arms of the maze divided by the
total time spent in any arm of the maze. the smaller this
ratio, the more open arm avoidance and the more banxiousq
the rat. a second measure was ratio entry defined as the
number of entries into the open arms of the maze divided by
the total entries into any arm of the maze. the smaller this
ratio, the more banxiousq the rat.
less commonly used measures of anxiety-like behavior
were measures of risk assessment. following blanchard et al.
(1992) and blanchard and blanchard (1989), risk assessment
was scored when a rat poked its head and possibly forepaws
into an open arm of the maze. the rat’s hindquarters must
have been located in a closed arm of the maze at the time.
frequency of risk assessment was measured. frequencies
were divided by time spent in the closed arms of the maze to
produce a relative frequency risk assessment measure. in a
similar fashion, time spent in risk assessment was scored and
expressed as a relative time risk assessment by dividing by
time in the closed arms of the maze.
exploration and activity were scored as the number of
entries into any arm of the maze (total arm entries) as well as
total number of entries into the closed arms of the maze.
closed arm entries were subdivided into two further types of
closed arm entry. a closed arm return was scored when a rat
left a closed arm and then returned immediately to the same
closed arm. different closed arm entry occurred when a rat
left a closed arm and later entered the other closed arm.
entry to an arm was scored when a rat had all four feet
within one arm of the maze. other measures of exploration
included head dips in the plus-maze (placing snout or head
over the edge of an open arm). three kinds of head dips
were defined: protected, center, and unprotected. these
were scored when a head dip occurred when the rat had its

68

r. adamec et al. / european journal of pharmacology 504 (2004) 65–77

hindquarters in a closed arm of the maze (protected); when a
rat was standing with all four feet in the center of the maze
(neither in the open nor closed arms, center); and when the
rat had all four feet in the open arms (unprotected). rearing
was also scored in three forms: protected, center, and
unprotected, as was time spent grooming. cautious exploration was scored as stretch attends and flat back
approaches. a stretch attend occurred when a rat stretched
its body forward (stretched) and either sniffed or visually
scanned. flat back approaches arose from a stretch attend
posture with forward locomotion, with the back concave
and the stomach near the floor of the maze. both stretch
attends and flat back approaches were scored in the three
forms of protected, center, and unprotected. these measures
are derived from the ethological analysis of rodent behavior
in the plus-maze of rodgers and johnson (1995).
time in the center of the maze was also scored when rats
had all four feet in the center of the maze. faecal boli
deposited in the maze were also counted.
2.5. measuring behavior from videotape
all behavioral analyses from videotape were done by a
trained rater (10 years of experience).
2.6. acoustic startle testing and measures taken
startle response to an acoustic stimulus was determined
using a standard startle chamber (san diego instruments) in
a separate room from either hole board, plus-maze testing,
or cat exposure rooms. the sound-proof apparatus was fitted
with a 20.32-cm plexiglass cylinder, which was used to hold
the animal, as well as a speaker for producing the sound
bursts. motion of the animal within the cylinder was

detected via a piezoelectric transducer, which was positioned below the cylinder. output of the transducer was led
to a computer for sampling.
prior to startle testing, animals were acclimated to the
apparatus for 10 min with a background random noise level
of 60 db. then rats were given 20 trials (1/min) of 20-ms
bursts of 120 db of white noise rising out of a background
of 60 db. a computer recorded 20 samples of transducer
output. samples included a 20-ms baseline and 250-ms
sample after onset of the noise burst. average transducer
output just prior to noise burst was saved as a baseline
(v start). in addition, the computer found the maximum
startle amplitude within each of the samples (v peak) and this
value was also saved. peak startle amplitude was expressed
as v peak v start for analysis. at the end of the startle session,
the rats were returned to their home cages.
therapeutic test groups were given an injection of either
vehicle or  xxxd3509xxx  90 min prior to the startle test. all
other groups were tested without injection on the day of
startle testing.
testing occurred between the hours of 8:25 a.m. and 11:40
a.m. timing of testing was balanced among all of the groups.
2.7. drug and vehicle
vehicle was a suspension of two drops of tween 80
sonicated in 10 ml of sterile distilled water.  xxxd3509xxx 
(batch ee77485, synthesized at the department of medicinal chemistry; merck, darmstadt, germany) was suspended by sonication in fresh vehicle at each testing day and
kept in the dark while being stirred with a magnetic stir bar
until injection. all volumes of injection were 0.5 ml. dose
for each animal was calculated in milligrams per kilogram of
the salt and that amount was sonicated in 0.5 ml of vehicle.

2.8. statistics
all measures in the hole board and plus-maze were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (anova)
examining group differences ( xxxg22xxx  for pc, solo program). when test assumptions of normality were violated,
nonparametric analysis of medians (kruskal–wallis oneway anova on ranks) was used. the startle data analysis
is described below. planned comparisons between controls
and test groups used two-tailed t tests for parametric
analysis and kruskal–wallis multiple z tests with p value
adjusted for planned comparisons. multiple unplanned
comparisons were done with bonferroni-adjusted p values

69

for t or z test. therapeutic and prophylactic groups were
analysed separately. in both cases, behaviors of the handled
controls and rats only exposed to a cat were contrasted with
injected groups. therefore, each analysis included six
injected groups and the control and exposed only groups
(a total of eight groups in the comparison).
2.9. ethical approval
this study was approved by the institutional animal
care committee of memorial university following canadian council on animal care (ccac) guidelines for use of
animals in research.

3. results
3.1. hole board and plus-maze tests—types of effects
there were three types of effects. the first was an effect of
cat exposure only, with no drug effects. in this case, all catexposed groups (injected and not injected) were equal but
differed from handled controls. the second and third types of
effects were those in which cat exposure did not appear to
change behavior but either injection per se (injection effects)
or drug per se (dose dependent drug effects) altered behavior.
there were significant group effects for six measures in
the elevated plus-maze and one measure in the hole board
test. measures and their f ratios appear in table 1. unless
otherwise noted, measures in the table are from the plusmaze. in addition, three of the measures were not normally
distributed, so kruskal–wallis one-way anova on ranks

was used (time and frequency risk and rearing in the hole
board, omnibus deviation from normality test z7.49,
pb0.03).
3.1.1. predator stress effects only
predator stress reduced all measures of open arm
exploration (ratio time, ratio entry, and unprotected head
dips) below control levels (fig. 1). there were no effects of
injection of vehicle or  xxxd3509xxx  given just after predator
stress (prophylactic test) or before testing 1 week after stress
(therapeutic test).
3.1.2. injection effects only
measures of risk assessment (time and frequency risk)
were unaffected by predator stress (table 1, fig. 2). risk
assessment in predator-stressed rats, however, was sensitive
to injection.

fig. 2. medianfs.e.m. for risk assessment measures showing that injection effects are plotted separately over groups. the left panel shows medians from the
test for prophylactic effects, and the right panel contains medians for test of therapeutic effects. for each test, medians marked with the same letter do not differ
but differ from medians marked with a different letter. medians marked with two letters fall between medians marked with either. for all planned median
contrasts, kruskal–wallis z test was used with pb0.05, two-tailed criterion; for other comparisons, pb0.05 using bonferroni-protected kruskal–wallis z test.

r. adamec et al. / european journal of pharmacology 504 (2004) 65–77

injection of vehicle, either 10 min after cat exposure
(prophylactic testing) or 90 min prior to plus-maze testing
(therapeutic testing), reduced risk below handled control
levels (fig. 2). since there were no differences between
vehicle and  xxxd3509xxx -injected groups, this effect is
interpreted as an effect of stress of injection per se.
3.1.3. drug effects only
drug only effects were observed on two measures:
different closed arm entries in the plus-maze and rearing in
the hole board. predator stress was without effect on either
behavior (fig. 3), consistent with a number of previous
studies.
the drug effects were confined to the therapeutic groups
(fig. 3).  xxxd3509xxx  given therapeutically (90 min before

71

test) increased entries into different closed arms of the plusmaze at the 20- and 40-mg/kg doses, while reducing rearing
in the hole board over doses of 2.5–40 mg/kg.
3.2. startle response analysis
for analysis of peak startle amplitude (v max v start),
we used two-way group-by-trial anova, with repeated
measures on trials. separate anovas were done on data
from the prophylactic and therapeutic groups. in both
analyses, handled controls and predator-stressed only
groups were included. no grouptrial interactions were
observed. group effects were reanalyzed using nonparametric anova (kruskal–wallis one-way anova
on ranks, df=7) because of serious deviations from

two measures showing drug effects are plotted separately for handled controls and injected groups. the left panel shows data from the test for prophylactic
effects, and the right panel contains data for test of therapeutic effects. for each test, means or medians marked with the same letter do not differ but differ from
means or medians marked with a different letter. medians marked with two letters fall between medians marked with either. for all planned median contrasts,
kruskal–wallis z test was used with pb0.05, two-tailed criterion; for other comparisons, pb0.05 using bonferroni-protected kruskal–wallis z test. for all
planned mean contrasts, t test with pb0.05 two-tailed criterion was used. for other comparisons, pb0.05 using bonferroni-protected t tests.

normality of data across groups (omnibus tests z1225.54,
pb0.000001).
3.2.1. prophylactic group effects
as seen previously (adamec et al., 1999b), predator
stress increased the amplitude of startle response 1 week
after cat exposure (v 2(7)=60.08, pb0.0001; fig. 4). similar
increases in startle response were seen in rats given either
vehicle or 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg  xxxd3509xxx  10 min after
predator stress. in contrast, rats given 10 mg/kg showed
startle amplitudes even greater than predator-stressed rats
and those given vehicle or lower doses of  xxxd3509xxx  (fig.

4, upper panel). higher doses of  xxxd3509xxx  (20 and 40 mg/
kg) appeared to block the potentiating effects of predator
stress on startle. these groups did not differ from unstressed
controls (fig. 4, upper left panel). these data suggest a
dose-related prophylactic drug effect of  xxxd3509xxx  on
predator stress-induced enhancement of startle. nevertheless,  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg,  xxxd3509xxx  appears to have the opposite
effect, increasing stress effects on startle.
3.2.2. therapeutic group effects
predator stress increased the amplitude of startle response
1 week after cat exposure (v 2(7)=183.62, pb0.0001; fig. 4,

fig. 4. medianfs.e.m. peak startle amplitudes (v max v start, in arbitrary units) are plotted over groups in the left panels. meanfs.e.m. trial constant (s) over
the same groups appear in the right panels. the upper panel shows data from the test for prophylactic effects, and the lower panel contains data for test of

lower panel). vehicle injection, however, reduced startle
amplitude in stressed rats to the level of controls. in contrast,
all doses of  xxxd3509xxx  potentiated startle amplitude over
stressed rats, although 10 mg/kg  xxxd3509xxx  was particularly effective (fig. 4, lower panel).
3.2.3. trial effects
trial effects f values for both analyses appear in table 2.
examination of the trial means suggested a rapid exponential decline in peak amplitude over the 20 trials (fig. 5).
therefore, exponentials were fit to the means of peak startle
amplitude over trials for each of the groups using the table
curve program (jandel). all fits were excellent, and fit
results appear in table 2. the equations fit were of the form:
y=a+b(e t/s ), where y is peak amplitude of startle response,
t is trial, a and b are constants, and s is the trial constant,
representing the number of trials to decline to 37% of the
maximal response. the program estimates s and its standard
error. therefore, it was possible to find the variance of each
s estimate, and this variance was used to find error terms for
planned t test comparisons. the t tests were done by

fig. 5. meanfs.e.m. of peak startle amplitude (v max v start, in arbitrary
units) are plotted versus trial for rats given  xxxd3509xxx  either 10 min after
predator stress or 90 min before test. the solid line is the plot of the
exponential curve fit to the means. s in the figure is the estimated trial
constant. these plots are meant to illustrate the fits, although for analysis,
exponentials were fit to peak startle amplitude over trials for each group
separately (see table 2).

comparing s values of the predator-stressed groups (2–8 in
both analyses in table 2) with the s value of control. s
values appear in table 2 as well as in fig. 4. there was no
effect of predator stress alone, or of vehicle or  xxxd3509xxx 
injections on s (all t{38}b1.79, pn0.05, two-tailed test).
3.3. nature of the predator stress
all measures taken during the cat exposure were
compared across all cat-exposed groups (including therapeutic and prophylactic  xxxd3509xxx  groups) in a single
one-way anova. there were no group differences in either
behavior of the cat toward the rats (all f{12,259}b1.34,
pn0.19), or in the rats’ defensive behavior toward the cat
(all f{12,259}b1.10, pn0.36) . so differential stress
experience or reaction cannot account for the group differences observed.

4. discussion
4.1. effects of predator stress on behavior
the present study replicates previous work reporting
lasting anxiogenic effects of predator stress (adamec, 1997,
2000; adamec and shallow, 1993; adamec et al., 1997;
cohen et al., 1996, 2003). increased anxiety appeared as
decreased open arm exploration in the plus-maze and
increased peak amplitude of acoustic startle response (figs.
1 and 4).
the effects on anxiety-like behavior were selective in
that they were not associated with changes in exploratory
tendency or activity. predator stress did not affect head dips
in the hole board—a validated measure of exploratory
tendency (file and wardill, 1975b). moreover, stressed
animals were not less active than controls, measured as time
active in the hole board and most activity measures in the
plus-maze.
4.2. drug effects on predator stress induced lasting changes
in behavior
4.2.1. prophylactic potential
the most interesting findings were those showing that
 xxxd3509xxx  blocks the lasting effects of predator stress on
arousability (startle) when given shortly after the stressor
(see fig. 4). these prophylactic effects were selective to
startle and were dose-specific, appearing at the higher doses
of  xxxd3509xxx  (20 and 40 mg/kg).
of concern is the potentiation of stress effects on
startle by 10 mg/kg  xxxd3509xxx . on the other hand, it is
unclear how reliable is this effect. we did not observe
potentiation of startle at this dose given prophylactically
in a preliminary single-dose study (unpublished observations). however, in the present study, potentiating effects
were observed in both the therapeutic and prophylactic
analyses, suggesting that the effect is reliable. if this
dose-dependent bidirectional effect of  xxxd3509xxx  is
reliable and replicable in humans, then obvious application concerns arise.
with regard to mechanism of this prophylactic action at
20 and 40 mg/kg, there are insufficient data to make
definitive statements. however, consideration of the effects
of acute administration of  xxxd3509xxx  on startle provides
some clues.
4.3. therapeutic potential of  xxxd3509xxx  and mechanisms of
therapeutic and prophylactic actions
 xxxd3509xxx  given 90 min before behavioral tests
(therapeutic tests) had anxiogenic-like effects. drug effects
were confined to startle. all doses of  xxxd3509xxx  increased
startle amplitude over vehicle-injected and uninjected
predator-stressed rats (fig. 4). these data do not suggest
a promising role for  xxxd3509xxx  as a therapeutic agent in

stress-precipitated hypervigilance (arousal). the mixed
anxiogenic and anxiolytic-like effects of  xxxd3509xxx  are
puzzling, but are not inconsistent with the literature. in
general, ssris given acutely are mainly anxiogenic in the
plus-maze and hole board tests, whereas effects of 5-ht1a
receptor agonists range from no effects, to anxiolytic and
anxiogenic effects (for review, see griebel, 1995). the
absence of effects of  xxxd3509xxx  on plus-maze behavior is
consistent with previous findings. treit et al. (2001)
reported no effects of single injections of  xxxd3509xxx  on
behavior in the plus-maze over a similar dose range in
male albino sprague–dawley rats. on the other hand,
griebel (1995) reported anxiolytic-like drug effects of
 xxxd3509xxx  in the shock probe burying test, consistent with
the anxiolytic effects of ssris and  xxxg1108xxx 
agonists in this model. in contrast, we find an anxiogenic
like effect of acute  xxxd3509xxx  on startle. therefore, the
nature of the effects (anxiolytic-like, anxiogenic-like, or
none at all) of acute administration of  xxxd3509xxx  appears
to be task-specific.
it is unlikely that the potentiating effect of  xxxd3509xxx  on
startle is due to its  xxxg1108xxx  agonist properties.  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonism is anxiolytic via action at 5-ht1a
autoreceptors in the raphe (jolas et al., 1995). moreover,
light-induced potentiation of acoustic startle is decreased by
serotonin reuptake inhibition with fluvoxamine and 5-ht1a
receptor agonism with flesinoxan (dejongh et al., 2002).
since our animals are tested in a lighted chamber, the acute
potentiating effects of  xxxd3509xxx  on startle appear to be
opposite to the effects of reuptake inhibition or 5-ht1a
agonism.
 xxxd3509xxx  could be working through some other
receptor, perhaps the  xxxg1115xxx . for example, acute
ssri [fluoxetine, sertraline, or m-chlorophenylpiperazine
(m-cpp)] treatments increase anxiety measured in the social
interaction test by an action at 5-ht2c receptors, but not at
5-ht1a receptors (bagdy et al., 2001). however, available
evidence is not supportive of the hypothesis. martin et al.
(2002) find no effects of 5-ht2c antagonism on fearpotentiated startle in rats.
another possibility is that a single-dose desensitization
of 5-ht1a receptors in startle modulation circuitry mediates
the potentiating effect. single-dose desensitization of  xxxg1108xxx  autoreceptors by  xxxg1108xxx  agonism has been
reported (o’connell and curzon, 1996; renyi et al., 1992).
a disabling of 5-ht1a receptors would be expected to
increase startle responses acutely.
moreover, long-lasting  xxxg1108xxx  desensitization
has been reported (renyi et al., 1992). it is possible that
long-lasting 5-ht1a autoreceptor desensitization participates in some way in inducing the prophylactic effects of
 xxxd3509xxx . nevertheless, these considerations still do not
explain the peculiar potentiation of startle in both therapeutic and prophylactic groups by the 10-mg/kg dose.
recent findings suggest another mechanism of prophylactic action of  xxxd3509xxx  on startle involving n-methyl-d-

r. adamec et al. / european journal of pharmacology 504 (2004) 65–77

aspartate (nmda) receptors. we have shown that blockade
of nmda receptors in the lateral amygdala prior to predator
stress prevents the lasting potentiation of startle by stress,
but not the anxiogenic effects of stress in the elevated plusmaze (adamec et al., 1999b). moreover, nmda receptor
block prevents lasting behavioral effects of predator stress
only when given before, but not after, predator stress
(adamec et al., 1999a). these findings are consistent with a
long-term potentiation-like process underlying behavioral
effects of predator stress (adamec, 1997; adamec et al.,
2001;adamec et al., 2003). it is of interest, then, that  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonism blocks theta burst stimulationinduced long-term potentiation in rodent lateral amygdala
slices (pollandt et al., 2003). it is conceivable that the  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonism of  xxxd3509xxx  in lateral amygdala
blocks predator stress-induced long-term potentiation and
enhancement of startle.
4.4. effects on startle habituation
s may be taken as an estimate of rate of habituation.
study of startle habituation is relevant to posttraumatic
stress disorder, since impairments of startle habituation have
been reported in posttraumatic stress disorder patients
(shalev et al., 1992). moreover, increases in s estimates
of startle habituation (indicating delay of habituation) have
been seen in predator-stressed rats (adamec, 1997). in the
present study, using a different startle paradigm, which we
expected would not produce habituation (see adamec et al.,
1999b), we find no effects of predator stress, vehicle, or
drugs on s. therefore,  xxxd3509xxx  has little effect on the rate
of startle habituation measured in this paradigm.
4.5. effects on risk assessment
the lack of effect of predator stress on risk assessment is
inconsistent with previous work showing that predator stress
suppresses risk assessment (adamec, 1997; adamec et al.,
1998). the different effects of predator stress on open arm
avoidance and risk assessment in the plus-maze are
consistent with evidence that the neural controls of predator
stress-induced change in open arm avoidance and risk
assessment involve separate neural substrates (adamec et
al., 1999b).
it is possible that animals differ in their susceptibility to
lasting suppression of risk assessment following predator
stress, as is the case for open arm exploration (cohen et al.,
2003). depending on subject sampling, one might or might
not include rats with such susceptibility. therefore, a
sampling bias might explain the results in the present study.
several observations strengthen the sampling bias idea.
there is a trend for predator-stressed rats in both prophylactic and therapeutic groups to reduce their risk assessment
(fig. 2). these trends become significant in rats injected
with either vehicle or  xxxd3509xxx  prophylactically. similarly, there is at least an acute suppression of risk

75

assessment in therapeutic predator-stressed groups. since
vehicle and drugged groups do not differ, the data suggest
an interaction between predator and injection stress in the
prophylactic and therapeutic groups. the combined stress of
injection and predator stress may have been enough to
exceed some threshold for change in risk assessment in
otherwise less susceptible rats.
the combined stress effect in therapeutic groups is acute
and must last at least 90 min. there are reports in the
literature of acute (20 min at least) anxiogenic effects of
injection per se in plus-maze behavior (adamec et al., 1991).
to our knowledge, there are no reports of lasting (1 week)
effects of a single injection on plus-maze behavior. however, the combined effect of just prior to predator stress and
injection stress just after cat exposure might be a sufficient
and lasting stress addition to impact risk assessment.
in addition,  xxxd3509xxx  at higher doses in the therapeutic
groups might have interfered with the proposed combined
effect of predator and injection stress. frequency of risk
assessment of groups given 20 and 40 mg/kg rose to levels
between stressed+injection and controls (fig. 2). this might
reflect some anxiolytic actions of combined reuptake
inhibition and  xxxg1108xxx  agonism discussed above.
alternatively, it might reflect a rapid desensitization of  xxxg1108xxx  receptors at the higher doses posited for the effects on
startle. the latter view is supported by the fact that 5-ht1a
receptor agonists decrease risk assessment in the plus-maze
in rats (griebel et al., 1997). therefore, increases in risk
assessment by high-dose  xxxd3509xxx  could reflect a downregulation of 5-ht1a receptors modulating risk assessment.
this conclusion is relevant to the need for high prophylactic
doses of  xxxd3509xxx  (20–40 mg/kg) to block effects of
predator stress on startle. it is possible that it requires these
doses to induce rapid and prolonged  xxxg1108xxx 
desensitization. moreover,  xxxg1108xxx  agonism may
be maximal  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg since this is the dose at which most
suppression of risk assessment is observed (fig. 2). given
that  xxxg1108xxx  agonism would be expected to reduce
startle, this does not explain the potentiating effects of the
10-mg/kg doses on startle, however.
4.6. effects on activity
effects of  xxxd3509xxx  on activity were confined to the
acute effects of the drug in the therapeutic groups. closed
arm entries were taken as measures of activity in the plusmaze (adamec, 2001; rodgers and johnson, 1995). therefore,  xxxd3509xxx  at higher doses (20 and 40 mg/kg) may be
having some behavioral-activating effects (fig. 3). this is a
behavior- and context-specific activation of different closed
arm entries, there being no drug effects on other activity
measures in the plus-maze (total arm entries, closed arm
returns) or in the hole board (time active).
increased different closed arm entries may reflect a
 xxxd3509xxx  agonism of ventral hippocampal 5-ht1a
receptors. similar effects have been produced acutely by

76

r. adamec et al. / european journal of pharmacology 504 (2004) 65–77

injection of the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-oh-n,ndipropylamino-tetraline (8-oh-dpat) into the ventral
hippocampus (file and gonzalez, 1996).  xxxd3509xxx 
agonism of hippocampal 5-ht1a receptors may also be
responsible for the decrease in vertical activity (rearing) in
the hole board. rearing is reduced by 5-ht1a agonism and
increased by 5-ht1a antagonism. moreover, hippocampal
5-ht1a receptors are implicated (jackson et al., 1998). this
effect of  xxxd3509xxx  on hole board rearing is again dosespecific (appearing fully from 5 to 40 mg/kg) and contextspecific, there being no drug dependent effects of  xxxd3509xxx  on rearing in the plus-maze. it should be mentioned
that there was nearly zero rearing in the center and open
arms of the plus-maze. however, levels of rearing in the
closed arms of the maze were comparable to levels of
rearing in the hole board.
taken together, the data suggest neither a general
sedative nor activating effect of  xxxd3509xxx . rather, the
effects of  xxxd3509xxx  on activity appear to be a contextspecific alteration of particular activities, likely mediated by
 xxxg1108xxx  agonism. these effects are independent of
effects of  xxxd3509xxx  on anxiety-like behavior in the plusmaze given that  xxxd3509xxx  was without effect on plusmaze anxiety measures.

5. conclusions
the findings suggest a prophylactic potential for
 xxxd3509xxx  in preventing hypervigilance (hyperarousal)
following severe stress. the dose-dependent bidirectional
action of  xxxd3509xxx  given prophylactically, combined with
its possible anxiogenic action when given therapeutically,
complicates a possible prophylactic use of the drug
following severe stress. however, it remains an open
question whether anxiogenic effects—if initially present at
all—will persist following chronic treatment in humans. the
data do suggest that ssris with targeted serotonin receptor
subtype actions might be further explored for a more
broadband and selective action on the lasting aftereffects of
stress in preclinical animal models.
