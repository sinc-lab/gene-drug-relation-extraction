endocrinol metab 286: e927–e931, 2004. first published february 3,
2004; 10.1152/ajpendo.00443.2003.—activins are multifunctional
growth and differentiation factors and stimulate fsh-␤ gene expression and fsh secretion by the pituitary gonadotropes. follistatins bind
activin, resulting in the neutralization of activin bioactivity. the
activin/ xxxg816xxx  system is present in the prostate tissue. prostatespecific antigen (psa) plays an important role in male reproductive
physiology as well as being very important as a tumor marker for
prostate cancer. thus the regulation of psa has important clinical
implications. previous studies showed that psa is primarily regulated
by androgens. in the present study, we evaluated the direct effects of
 xxxd2971xxx  on the proliferation and psa production of prostate cancer
lncap cells, which express functional activin receptors and androgen
receptor and psa. lncap cells were treated with  xxxd2971xxx  and
5␣-dihydrotestosterone (dht) with or without their antagonists ( xxxg816xxx  or the nonsteroidal anti-androgen  xxxd334xxx ).  xxxd2971xxx 
decreased cell growth of lncap cells in a dose-dependent manner,
whereas dht increased it in a biphasic manner. in contrast to their
opposing actions on cell growth, both  xxxd2971xxx  and dht upregulated
psa gene expression and increased psa secretion by lncap cells.
the effects of  xxxd2971xxx  and dht to increase psa production were
synergistic or additive.  xxxg816xxx  or  xxxd334xxx  was without effect
on cell growth or psa production. the effects of  xxxd2971xxx  on lncap
cells were blocked by  xxxg816xxx , not by  xxxd334xxx , whereas effects
of dht were prevented by  xxxd334xxx , not by  xxxg816xxx .  xxxd2971xxx 
upregulates psa production, and the effect is through an androgen
receptor-independent pathway. the activin/ xxxg816xxx  system can be a
physiological modulator of psa gene transcription and secretion in
the prostate tissue, and activins may cooperate with androgen to
upregulate psa in vivo.

of the transforming growth factor-␤
(tgf-␤) superfamily of growth factors. activins are dimeric
proteins composed of two inhibin-␤ proteins translated from at
least five different gene transcripts, referred to as ␤a, ␤b, ␤c,
␤d, and ␤e. activins are multifunctional growth and differentiation factors participating in the regulation of many biological systems and processes, including embryonic development, erythroid differentiation, and tumorigenesis (14, 17, 21,
22), by interactions with specific cell surface receptors that
show considerable subtype diversity (12) and have been identified in many tissues (10), including the prostate (4, 20, 28)
and prostate cancer cells (23).  xxxd2971xxx  (the inhibin-␤a

dimer) and  xxxd2971xxx  (the inhibin-␤b dimer) have profound
effects on cell growth and function. both stimulatory (8, 19,
30) and inhibitory (5, 27) effects have been documented
depending on cell type. follistatins are structurally unrelated
proteins that are glycosylated monomeric proteins derived
from either of two mrna splice variants coding for 288 or 315
amino acid proteins after removal of a common signal peptide
at the time of synthesis, and bind activin, resulting in the
neutralization of activin bioactivity (3, 11).
among the human prostate tumor cell lines lncap,
du145, and  xxxg1682xxx , a strong growth-inhibitory effect in response to  xxxd2971xxx  is seen only after addition of exogenous
 xxxd2971xxx  to the lncap cell line, which expresses functional
activin receptors (2, 13, 24). this growth inhibition is dose
dependent and, importantly, is androgen independent (13).
although activin was also found to inhibit proliferation of
the du145 cells to a lesser extent, no growth inhibition was
seen in the  xxxg1682xxx  cells (13).
 xxxg1281xxx  (psa) plays an important role in
male reproductive physiology as well as being very important
as a tumor marker for prostate cancer. psa is a  xxxg745xxx 
and member of the  xxxg1280xxx  family of proteases, and it
is secreted into seminal fluid at concentrations of 0.5–3 mg/ml
(i.e., ⬃1 million times those in plasma) (25). in semen, psa
dissolves the gel forming after ejaculation by digesting semenogelin-1 and -2 and fibronectin, causing release of the sperm,
which is essential for sperm function (9). previous studies have
shown that psa is positively regulated by androgens via its
receptor (16). activins were first identified by their ability to
regulate pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh). activins
stimulate fsh-␤ gene expression and fsh secretion by the
pituitary gonadotropes. we hypothesized that, by analogy with
fsh, activins regulate psa in prostate cells. in the present
study, using prostate cancer lncap cells, we show that activin
a upregulates psa gene expression and secretion and that the
effect is through an  xxxg183xxx  (ar)-independent
pathway.
materials and methods

medium, or 2 ⫻ 105 cells/well of 6-well plates with 2 ml of medium.
after a 24-h incubation, cells were treated with 2% dcc-fbs with or
without the test agents.
cell proliferation assays. cellular growth was assessed by total cell
counts and by mts assay. lncap cells were cultured with media with
10% fbs-dcc for 24 h, and then media were changed into fresh
media with 2% fbs-dcc with or without test agents. after 48-h
treatment, cells were counted in a hemocytometer, and the viability of
cells was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. mts assay was
also performed using the celltiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive proliferation assay (promega, madison, wi), which is a colorimetric
method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation
assays, as reported previously (7). for this assay, the mts assay
reagent was added to each well after 48-h treatment, and the absorbance was measured after 2-h incubation at 37°c using thermomax
microplate reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca).
total rna extraction and cdna synthesis. total rna was extracted using isogene (wako, osaka, japan), following the manufacturer’s instructions. the concentration and purity of rna were
determined spectrophotometrically. two micrograms of total rna
were reverse-transcribed into first-strand cdna by use of the thermoscript rt system (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) at the final volume of
20 ␮l.
quantitative real-time rt-pcr. real-time monitoring of pcr
reactions was performed using the lightcycler system and the sybr
green i dye (roche molecular systems, indianapolis, in), as previously described (29). the primers for psa (accession no. x05332)

were sense: 5⬘-tgaccaagttcatgctgtgt-3⬘ and antisense: 5⬘gtcatttccaaggttccaag-3⬘, which are located in different
exons. the primers for  xxxg861xxx 
( xxxg861xxx ) and standard  xxxg861xxx  cdna were obtained from
search-lc (heidelberg, germany). reactions included 0.5 ␮l of
cdna, 2 ␮l of lc dna master sybr green i mix, 1 ␮l of 10 ␮m
primers, and for psa pcr 1.6 ␮l of 25 mm mgcl2. the final volume
was adjusted with h2o to 20 ␮l. the cycling conditions were as
follows: for psa, initial denaturation at 95°c for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for 10 s, annealing at 62°c for 10 s,
and extension at 72°c for 10 s; for  xxxg861xxx , initial denaturation at
95°c for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for
10 s, annealing at 68°c for 10 s, and extension at 72°c for 16 s.
fluorescent product was measured by a single acquisition mode after
each cycle. the expressions of psa and  xxxg861xxx  in each sample were
quantified in separate tubes. for distinguishing specific from nonspecific products and primer dimers, a melting curve was obtained as
previously described (29).
psa protein assay. lncap cells were cultured with media with
10% fbs-dcc for 24 h, and then media were changed into fresh
media with 2% fbs-dcc with or without test agents. after a 48-h
treatment, the conditioned media were collected, centrifuged to remove residual cells, and stored at ⫺20°c. the immulite thirdgeneration psa assay, which is a solid-phase, two-site sequential
chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay executed on the immulite
instrument (15, 26), was used to measure psa levels of culture
medium. mts assay was performed at the same time, and results were

discussion

a number of investigations have clearly demonstrated hormonal regulation of the psa gene expression primarily by
androgens in the prostatic carcinoma cell line lncap (16).
over the last several years, a detailed understanding is evolving as to how ar functions as a transcriptional regulator via its
binding to androgen response elements within promoter and
enhancer regions of psa (1). however, little progress has been
made in identifying androgen-independent regulatory mechanisms involved in psa gene regulation.
in the present study, we show that  xxxd2971xxx  upregulates psa
gene expression and increases psa secretion by lncap cells. the
effects of activin to increase psa mrna levels and psa secretion were dose dependent (figs. 1a and 2), both of which were
neutralized by  xxxg816xxx  (figs. 1b and 2). previous studies have
shown that the activin/ xxxg816xxx  system, which is present in the
prostate tissue, plays a crucial role in the local regulation of
human prostate cell growth (20, 28). in addition, our results
suggest that activin and  xxxg816xxx  also play an important role in
the regulation of psa production and secretion by the prostatic
cells.
to our knowledge, only one previous study (31) addressed
the effect of activin on psa expression. the investigators of
that study reported that activin stimulated the expression of
 xxxg46xxx , psa, and ar in lncap cells (31).
however, their experiments were not performed under androgen depletion conditions, which makes the results difficult to
interpret. for example, we could consider that the result of
activin to upregulate psa expression is due to the ar upregulation. our study is the first to demonstrate the upregulation of
psa by activins in the absence of androgens.
it is very likely that the effect of  xxxd2971xxx  on lncap cells
is through an ar-independent pathway. first,  xxxd2971xxx  decreased cell growth of lncap cells, whereas dht had the
opposite effect. second, the effects of  xxxd2971xxx  on both cell
growth and psa expression were blocked by  xxxg816xxx , not by
 xxxd334xxx , whereas those of dht were prevented by  xxxd334xxx , not by  xxxg816xxx .
then we studied whether there are any interactions between
 xxxd2971xxx  and dht. the effects of  xxxd2971xxx  and dht to
increase psa production by lncap cells are additive or
synergistic in mrna or protein levels (fig. 3), respectively,
ajp-endocrinol metab • vol

providing further evidence that the activin effect is ar independent.  xxxd2971xxx  enhanced the effect of dht on psa gene
expression and secretion. thus activins and androgens may
work cooperatively to regulate psa expression in the prostate
cells.
although a great deal is known regarding activin signaling
in a variety of cells, very little is currently known about the
specific signal transduction pathway leading to psa expression
by activin. as a member of the tgf-␤ superfamily of proteins,
activin signals through a heteromeric receptor complex and
intracellular signaling molecules known as smad proteins.
recently, kang et al. (6) has shown that  xxxg2170xxx  enhances psa
expression, which is induced by dth, in lncap cells. future
researches are needed to study whether smad proteins are
involved in activin stimulation of psa gene.
furthermore, the fact that psa expression is exclusive to
prostate epithelial cells suggests the existence of the prostatespecific transcription factors necessary for activin- or androgen-dependent stimulation of psa gene. recently, oettgen et
al. (18) reported the characterization of a novel prostate epithelial-specific ets transcription factor, prostate-derived ets
factor (pdef), that is involved in psa gene regulation and acts
as a coregulator of ar. importantly, pdef acts as an androgen-independent transcriptional activator of the psa promoter
and also interacts directly with the dna-binding domain of
ar and enhances androgen-mediated activation of the psa
promoter. interestingly, the lncap cell line expresses pdef
mrna. thus pdef may be involved in the mechanisms by
which activins regulate the psa gene, and future studies to test
this hypothesis are of considerable interest.
in conclusion,  xxxd2971xxx  upregulates psa gene expression
and increases psa secretion by lncap cells, and the effect of
activin is through an ar-independent pathway. in addition,
activin enhances the effect of dht on psa production. the
activin/ xxxg816xxx  system can be a physiological modulator of
psa gene transcription and secretion in the prostate tissue, and
activins may cooperate with androgen to upregulate psa in
vivo.
