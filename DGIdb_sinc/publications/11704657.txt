1 we aimed to characterize the 5-ht receptors involved in the 5-ht-induced eect on electrically
induced contractions of dog antrum longitudinal muscle in vitro.
2 in the presence of l-noarg (0.1 mm), electrical ®eld stimulation (efs) induced atropine- and
tetrodotoxin-sensitive contractions. tetrodotoxin or atropine left any agonist tested ineective.
these efs-induced contractions were on average enhanced by 5-ht (0.3 mm), however, pronounced
variation in the response to 5-ht was observed. there were non-signi®cant trends of the selective 5ht3 receptor antagonist granisetron (1 mm), and  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm; preventing interactions of 5ht with 5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht5,  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptors) to increase the response to 5-ht. the
selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist gr 113808 (0.1 mm) displayed a non-signi®cant trend to inhibit
the 5-ht-induced increase.
3 combination experiments with  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm), granisetron (1 mm) and gr 113808 (0.1 mm)
revealed that the 5-ht (0.3 mm)-induced response consisted of (1) an excitatory component blocked
by gr 113808, (2) excitatory and inhibitory components both blocked by  xxxd2621xxx .
4 the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist  xxxd3039xxx  (0.3 mm) increased efs-induced contractions,
an eect prevented by gr 113808 (0.1 mm).
5 the increase of efs-induced contractions by the preferential  xxxg1113xxx  agonist a-me-5-ht
(0.3 mm) was antagonized by  xxxg1114xxx  antagonists.
6 the 5-ht1/5-ht7 receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct; 0.3 mm) inhibited efsinduced contractions. this was prevented by  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm), the 5-ht7 receptor antagonist
mesulergine (0.3 mm) and the selective 5-ht7 receptor antagonist sb-269970 (0.3 mm).
7 in the presence of gr 113808 (0.1 mm), a-me-5-ht (1 mm) increased efs-induced contractions.
the 5-ht (0.3 mm)-induced inhibition of the stimulation by a-me-5-ht was prevented by sb-269970
(0.3 mm).
8 in conclusion, dog antral longitudinal muscle is endowed with (1) excitatory neuronal  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors and 5-ht2b receptors and (2) inhibitory smooth muscle 5-ht7 receptors.

introduction
the incentive to study involvement of 5-ht receptors in
contractile responses of dog isolated stomach tissue was given
by results obtained in in vivo studies. it was shown that using
a heidenhain pouch set-up, 5-ht administered intravenously
induced a contraction that could be prevented by the selective
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist sb 204070 (bingham et al., 1995).
further, compounds with agonistic properties at  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors were found to induce an atropine-sensitive gastric
contraction (bermudez et al., 1990), and to increase gastric
emptying, a process associated with enhanced co-ordinated
contractile responses (gullikson et al., 1993). presence of
other 5-ht receptors in the gastric area cannot be excluded,

as  xxxd2621xxx  (moderate to high anity for every 5-ht
receptor except for the 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor) and
 xxxd2419xxx  (selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist) induced in
some dogs an ambiguous alteration of gastric contractility. in
this manner, these antagonists evoked sometimes an inhibition, but most prominently an increase in contractility was
observed (bingham et al., 1995). this study also reported
variable eects after administering the selective 5-ht3
receptor antagonist granisetron. in summary, a mixture of
various 5-ht receptor-mediated responses may be observed
in studies on dog stomach.
a single in vitro study has been performed on the
involvement of 5-ht in canine antral contractility using
longitudinal muscle strips, where 5-ht induced an increase in
electrical ®eld stimulation (efs)-induced contraction (de
ridder & schuurkes, 1993). this ampli®cation could not be

blocked by separate addition of 5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht3 or 5ht4 receptor antagonists ( xxxd2419xxx , methiothepin, granisetron or  xxxd3451xxx ). nevertheless, in unpublished experiments using this bioassay, an inhibition of the 5-ht-evoked
increase in contraction after selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
antagonism by sb 204070 (10 nm) was observed (mentioned
in briejer et al., 1995), however, this eect was not
signi®cant. this may be explained by either this tissue simply
does not exhibit  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, or other 5-ht receptors in
addition to  xxxg1117xxx  receptors mediate enhancement of
contractions. interestingly, the experiment to explore this ±
testing the eect of a selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist on
the 5-ht- induced eect under blockade of every 5-ht
receptor, with the exception of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor ± was not
performed. moreover, in view of the observed clear
stimulation of antral contractility by a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
agonist (bermudez et al., 1990), the clear modulatory role
that  xxxg1117xxx  receptors play in canine gastric emptying
(bermudez et al., 1990; briejer et al., 1998) and the recent
demonstration of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors present on cholinergic
nerves in gastric corpus longitudinal and circular muscle
(prins et al., 2001), we hypothesized that these receptors
should be demonstrable also in the antrum in vitro.
this discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results
prompted us to re-investigate in vitro the eect of 5-ht on
canine antral motility. using the same tissue but a slightly
modi®ed bioassay as compared to that reported by de ridder
& schuurkes (1993), we performed cross-antagonism experiments to explore possible heterogeneity of 5-ht receptors
and studied the eects of some tryptamine analogues and
selective 5-ht receptor agonists.

methods
preparation
beagle dogs (5 ± 12 kg) of both sexes were used. they were
decerebrated and, subsequently, exsanguinated through the
carotid artery. the stomach was excised and cut open along
the greater curvature. luminal contents were rinsed out with
de jalon solution (composition in mm: kcl 5.6, cacl2 0.5,
nahco3 6.0, nacl 155, glucose 2.8) and the mucosa and
adhering omentum were removed. from the antropyloric
canal 1 cm proximal to the pylorus, eight longitudinal muscle
strips of approximately 2 ± 3 cm length and 2 ± 3 mm width
were cut and anchored to organ bath hooks and suspended in
a classical organ bath set-up for isotonic measurement (2 g
load). the 20 ml organ baths were ®lled with de jalon
solution, kept at 378c and gassed with carbogen (95% o2,
5% co2).

contraction. after 4 ± 5 consecutive pulse trains, contractions
were maximal. the voltage was then reduced until reproducible contractions approximating 30 ± 50% of the contraction observed at 20 v was obtained. the current measured
ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 a at 20 v (response always maximal)
and from 0.25 to 0.45 a at reduced voltage (3 ± 8 v). this
was allowed for at least 15 min, followed by addition of
treatment, which, in turn, was left to incubate for 15 min,
while efs was continued. then, a single-dose of agonist was
added to each organ bath under continued electrical
stimulation and the response was followed for another
15 min. each muscle strip was used to test the eect of one
treatment on the eect of a single-dose of agonist.
treatments included solvents, single antagonists or various
combinations of antagonists.

data analysis
for each individual muscle strip, the average contraction to 5
efs pulse trains before addition of treatment or solvent was
taken as 100% (called the initial value) and all contractions
of this strip were related to this initial value. repeated
measures over time were analysed using proc mixed
(sas v pc 6.12) for data with an unbalanced covariance
structure. a level of p50.05 was considered to be signi®cant
and the number of dogs used was denoted by n.

the following compounds were used (with their pharmaceutical names and respective suppliers given in parentheses): [1 [2 - [(methylsulphonyl)amino]ethyl] - 4 - piperidinyl]methyl 1 methyl - 1h - indole - 3 - carboxylate (gr 113808), 4 - amino 5 - chloro - 2,3 - dihydro - n - (1 - [3 - methoxypropyl] - 4 - piperidinyl) - 7 - benzofurancarboxamide

all compounds were dissolved in 0.9% nacl solution,
except for gr 113808, which was dissolved in 0.9% nacl
acidi®ed with tartaric acid in the stock solution. solutions
were prepared freshly on the day of the experiment and all
dilutions were made using 0.9% nacl solution. the solvents
did not aect efs-induced contractions.

results

after a 30-min period of stabilization, the strips were
contracted with carbachol (10 mm) to test their viability and
responsiveness. after wash-out, l-noarg (0.1 mm) was
added to the organ bath solution in order to prevent
relaxation due to  xxxd2738xxx . after 30 min of incubation,
the muscle strips were electrically stimulated (initial parameters: 1-ms pulses in trains of 10 s, at an interval of 3 min,
at 20 hz and 20 v), where each pulse train resulted in a

carbachol (10 mm) induced a rapid contraction, and, after
wash-out, the muscle strips returned to basal muscle length
within 5 min. the muscle strips were not spontaneously
active during the experiment, although addition of a-me-5ht or 5-ht, but not  xxxd3039xxx ,  xxxd26xxx -5-ht or 5-ct,

contractility (roughly 510% of contraction to maximal
stimulation). this eect of a-me-5-ht or 5-ht was not
in¯uenced by any antagonist or tetrodotoxin (ttx). as the
focus of this study was to characterize the eect of agonists
on neuronal efs-induced contractions, these eects were not
further studied. each electrical pulse train in the presence of
l-noarg (0.1 mm) resulted in a contraction with appreciable reproducibility, although decay of the contractile
response was observed in time-matched control experiments
(1.9+0.4% per pulse train, n=26 dogs, depicted in most
®gures showing mean results). atropine and tetrodotoxin
prevented efs-induced contractions, therefore, these were
entirely due to stimulation of cholinergic nerves followed by
release of acetylcholine stimulating muscarinic cholinoceptors.

experiments with 5-ht
pre-liminary experiments revealed that mainly excitatory
responses to 5-ht were observed at low concentrations
(3 nm: increase of initial value by 17+5%, 30 nm:
110+51%, n=6). 5-ht (0.3 mm) induced excitatory as well
as inhibitory responses, whereas at a high concentration of
5-ht (i.e. 3 mm), inhibitory responses pre-dominated
(48+27% inhibition of initial value, n=6). we chose 5ht (0.3 mm) to perform further experimentation with, since
at this concentration the heterogenous nature of the 5-htinduced eect was most pronounced. this could be
particularly helpful in testing the hypothesis that multiple
mechanisms are involved in the 5-ht-induced response in
this bioassay. single-dose addition of 5-ht was preferred
above cumulative addition since time-dependent decay of

efs-evoked contractions would limit reproducibility of the
5-ht curve.
the eect of 5-ht (0.3 mm) on efs-evoked contractions
was subject to pronounced across-animal variation. in this
manner, inhibition, stimulation, a biphasic response consisting of initial stimulation followed by inhibition as well as no
response to 5-ht was observed (individual data presented in
figure 1a). the mean response was signi®cant stimulation
(average maximal increase by 53+10%; figure 1b). in the
presence of  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm), 5-ht induced enhancement
of efs-induced contractions only. in the presence of the
selective  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist granisetron (1 mm), 5-ht
induced a stimulation in six out of seven antral preparations
and was ineective in one. however, these tendencies of
 xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm) and granisetron (1 mm) to augment the
5-ht-evoked eect (increases by 70+26% and 58+15%,
respectively) were not signi®cant. atropine or tetrodotoxin
blocked efs-evoked contractions, in their presence 5-ht
induced no eect (tetrodotoxin) or a marginal, nonsigni®cant, re-appearance of contractions (atropine).
pre-incubation with the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist
gr 113808 (0.1 mm) did not modify the heterogenous nature
of the 5-ht-evoked response, as an inhibition (in 1/7 dog
preparations), no eect (in 1/7 preparations) as well as an
increase (in 5/7 preparations) was observed (mean response:
figure 2a). on average, gr 113808 tended to inhibit the 5ht-induced response (22+13%), but this eect was not
signi®cant. the signi®cant increase in efs-evoked contractions by 5-ht that was still observed in the presence of
 xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm; figure 2b), or granisetron (1 mm; figure
2c), or  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm) plus granisetron (1 mm; figure
2d), was antagonized by gr 113808 (0.1 mm). this suggested

contractions of canine antral longitudinal muscle in solvent conditions (a), in the presence of  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm) (b), in the
presence of granisetron (1 mm) (c), or in the presence of granisetron (1 mm) plus  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm) (d). all experiments were
carried out in the presence of l-noarg (0.1 mm). data points are presented as mean contraction+s.e.mean, calculated as
percentage of the mean contraction to 5 efs pulse trains immediately prior to any addition of compound (initial value).

that in the presence of  xxxd2621xxx  and granisetron, the 5ht-induced eect was  xxxg1117xxx  receptor-mediated.
when granisetron (1 mm) plus gr 113808 (0.1 mm) were
included, 5-ht caused an inhibition in 3/7 dog preparations,
a stimulation in one preparation, whereas 5-ht was without
eect in the other three (individual responses: figure 3a). no
eect to 5-ht was observed after inclusion of  xxxd2621xxx 
(1 mm; figure 3b). thus, under the conditions applied,
 xxxd2621xxx  prevented a heterogenous response to 5-ht.
up to this point, these data suggested that the 5-htinduced increase of efs-induced contraction is the net result
of activation of a heterogenous (stimulatory and inhibitory)
5-ht receptor population, of which one population with
excitatory characteristics resembles the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor. to
characterize which 5-ht receptors are involved, we applied in
further experiments tryptamine analogues and selective
agonists in combination with antagonists.
british journal of pharmacology vol 134 (6)

exploration of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor involvement
the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist  xxxd3039xxx  increased
contractions elicited by efs (64+21%, p50.05 vs initial
value; figure 4). the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist gr
113808 (0.1 mm) antagonized this eect to  xxxd3039xxx . in
the presence of atropine or tetrodotoxin the efs-contractions
were blocked, leaving  xxxd3039xxx  without eect.

exploration of  xxxg1116xxx  involvement
2-methyl-5-ht ( xxxd26xxx -5-ht), a preferential  xxxg1116xxx 
agonist, did not aect efs-evoked contractions (n=5;
results not shown). in preparations of two dogs, the 5ht3 receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguanide (1 mm) was
tested, but this failed to aect the contractions elicited by
efs as well.

contraction to 5 efs pulse trains immediately prior to any addition
of compound (initial value).

exploration of  xxxg1113xxx  involvement
the preferential  xxxg1113xxx  agonist a-methyl-5-ht (ame-5-ht) induced a marked increase in contractions elicited
by efs (74+14%, p50.05 vs initial value; figure 5). the

selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  (0.1 mm)
increased the efs-induced contractions (increase by
24+7%, p50.05 vs initial value) and additionally, failed to
antagonize the eect to a-me-5-ht (increase of 55+11%,
p40.05 vs control eect of a-me-5-ht).  xxxd2419xxx  (10 nm)
did not increase efs-evoked contractions and also failed to
antagonize the response to a-me-5-ht. addition of the 5ht2 and 5-ht7 receptor antagonist mesulergine, the 5-ht1,
5-ht2, 5-ht5,  xxxg1119xxx  and 5-ht7 receptor antagonist
 xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm) or the selective  xxxg1114xxx 
antagonist sb-204741 (0.3 mm) did not modify the efsinduced contractions, but antagonized the increase to a- xxxd944xxx -ht (increase by 19+12, 15+10 and 17+6%, respectively,
all p50.05 vs control eect of a-me-5-ht). inclusion of
tetrodotoxin blocked the efs-contractions leaving a-me-5ht ineective. in the presence of atropine, the efs
contractions were blocked (797+2% inhibition of initial
value), but addition of a-me-5-ht resulted in a reappearance of contractions upon efs in 3/6 dogs (average
eect 26+15% of initial value). similar to that observed with
5-ht (figure 1b), this eect was not signi®cant.

investigation of 5-ht1 or 5-ht7 receptor involvement
5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct; 0.3 mm), preferentially stimulating 5-ht1 and 5-ht7 receptors, induced an inhibition
of efs-induced contraction (791+4%; p50.05 vs initial
value; figure 6). in the presence of  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm), that
in 4/6 dog preparations marginally augmented the contractions to efs (average eect 20+8%, p50.05), 5-ct induced
stimulation in all dogs tested. the  xxxd2621xxx -induced
contraction increments in this experimental group of dogs
contrasted with the non-signi®cant eect of  xxxd2621xxx  on
efs-induced contractions in the experimental groups where
either 5-ht or a-me-5-ht was the agonist. the 5-ht2 and

(0.1 mm). data points represent mean contraction+s.e.mean, calculated as percentage of the mean contraction to 5 efs pulse
trains immediately prior to any addition of compound (initial value).

5-ht7 receptor antagonist mesulergine (0.3 mm) prevented
any eect of 5-ct (0.3 mm), as illustrated by the efs-induced
contractions in this treatment group being nearly superimposed on those in the solvent ± solvent group. sb-269970
(0.3 mm), a compound reported to be a selective 5-ht7
receptor antagonist (hagan et al., 2000) left 5-ct (0.3 mm)
ineective.
under  xxxg1117xxx  receptor blockade by gr 113808 (0.1 mm),
a-me-5-ht (1 mm) induced an increase in efs-evoked
contractions (figure 7). 5-ht induced an inhibition of these
contractions, an eect prevented by sb-269970 (0.3 mm).
in order to characterize the nature of the agonist-induced
eect on efs-induced contractions, the agonist eect on
cumulative concentration ± contraction curves to acetylcholine
was assessed. the acetylcholine curves were non-monophasic
and did not reach their maximal response up to 100 mm,
hence, curve ®tting was not performed. pre-treatment with 5ht (0.3 mm),  xxxd3039xxx  (0.3 mm) or a-me-5-ht (0.3 mm)
did not modify the curve to exogenously added acetylcholine.
on average, the contraction to acetylcholine was reduced,
albeit non-signi®cantly, by 5-ct (0.3 mm) by 26% (n=4,
results not shown).

discussion
the data presented here strongly suggest presence of
excitatory  xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht2b receptors and inhibitory 5ht7 receptors in dog antral longitudinal muscle. the
simultaneous stimulation of this heterogenous 5-ht receptor
british journal of pharmacology vol 134 (6)

population by 5-ht may serve as an explanation for the
variable 5-ht-evoked responses observed.
the primary indication for a heterogenous receptor
population involved in the actions of 5-ht was provided
by the ®rst experiment, in which separate incubation of
 xxxd2621xxx , granisetron or gr 113808 could not signi®cantly aect the response to 5-ht. these three antagonists
together shield interactions of 5-ht with every currently
known 5-ht receptor (5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht5,  xxxg1119xxx  and 5ht7) receptors by  xxxd2621xxx  (gommeren et al., 1998); 5ht3 receptors by granisetron (sanger & nelson, 1989), 5ht4 receptors by gr 113808 (gale et al., 1994), thus absence
of antagonism by these compounds may appear indicative of
5-ht activating receptors not belonging to the 5-ht receptor
family. however, this suggestion was overruled by the
blockade of the response by the combination of these three
antagonists. this outcome did also favour the hypothesis that
more than one 5-ht receptor mediated the response to 5-ht.
the second indication for 5-ht receptor heterogeneity was
the observation that the 5-ht-evoked increase was considerably variable in the sub-set of dogs used. the further increase
in variation of the response to 5-ht upon  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
antagonism by gr 113808, either with or without inclusion
of granisetron (blocking 5-ht3 receptors), also corroborated
heterogeneity. in this manner, the varying 5-ht-induced
eect at this concentration may be explained by acrossanimal and/or within-animal variation in expression of both
stimulatory and inhibitory 5-ht receptors.
upon blockade of every 5-ht receptor with the exception
of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (by inclusion of granisetron and

113808 (0.1 mm) and l-noarg (0.1 mm). data points are presented
as mean contraction+s.e.mean, calculated as percentage of the mean
contraction to 5 efs pulse trains immediately prior to any addition

 xxxd2621xxx ), the remaining potentiating eect of 5-ht was
blocked by addition of gr 113808, suggesting involvement of
excitatory  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. indeed, the markedly increased

multiple 5-ht receptors in canine antrum

1357

efs-evoked contractions due to the selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
agonist  xxxd3039xxx  were also antagonized by gr 113808,
hereby emphasizing that indeed  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are involved.
in line with that observed in the dog corpus in vitro (prins et
al., 2001), the absence of eect of either 5-ht or
 xxxd3039xxx  in the presence of atropine or tetrodotoxin,
suggested localization of excitatory  xxxg1117xxx  receptors on
cholinergic nerves. this demonstration of excitatory  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors on antral cholinergic ®bres of the dog, a
phenomenon already described for humans (schuurkes et
al., 1991) and guinea-pigs (takada et al., 1999), suggests that
dogs may not be that dierent with respect to  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor-mediated antral motility as previously suggested
(de ridder & schuurkes, 1993). the latter study suggested
the 5-ht-induced antral muscle excitation was not due to 5ht4 receptor stimulation.
in the presence of gr 113808 and granisetron, there was
still a variable response to 5-ht. as additional preincubation with  xxxd2621xxx  blocked any response to 5ht, this outcome was suggestive for a  xxxd2621xxx -sensitive
mechanism of 5-ht-evoked inhibition and stimulation. the
presence of an inhibitory 5-ht receptor was stressed by the
experiments with the preferential 5-ht1/5-ht7 receptor
agonist 5-ct. 5-ct induced an inhibition that was prevented
by  xxxd2621xxx , that for this particular experiment was used
to block 5-ht1 and 5-ht7 receptors. this implies that
 xxxd2621xxx  can indeed be utilized to prevent 5-ht from
stimulating the inhibitory 5-ht receptor in this preparation.
this was corroborated by the eect of 5-ht in the presence
of  xxxd2621xxx , in which no 5-ht-induced inhibition was
observed. the antagonism of the 5-ct response by
mesulergine, a 5-ht7 receptor antagonist that lacks relevant
anity at 5-ht1 receptors, suggested involvement of 5-ht7
receptors. the selective 5-ht7 receptor antagonist sb-269970
(0.3 mm; lovell et al., 2000) prevented the inhibitory eects
due to 5-ct, evidently demonstrating that this eect by 5-ct
was indeed mediated by 5-ht7 receptors. moreover, the
inhibition to 5-ht under combined  xxxg1117xxx  receptor blockade
and ®rm  xxxg1113xxx  stimulation was prevented by sb269970. this emphasized 5-ht7 receptor involvement and
demonstrated that 5-ht stimulates these receptors at 0.3 mm.
it is highly likely that these 5-ht7 receptors are located
directly on the smooth muscle. in a previous study using the
same tissue, the 5-ht- or 5-ct-induced relaxation of
 xxxd2586xxx -evoked precontraction were both insensitive to
ttx but antagonized by mesulergine (prins et al., 1999). 5ht7 receptors are positively coupled to adenylate cyclase
(bard et al., 1993), hence a location on smooth muscle is in
full agreement with a relaxation. as in this study the efsinduced contractions were observed on a stable basal muscle
length, a direct relaxation was not observed. thus, smooth
muscle 5-ht7 receptor-mediated relaxation presumably
functionally antagonized efs-evoked contraction. this is
also corroborated by the reduced contractions to exogenously
added acetylcholine after 5-ct (0.3 mm) addition.
as indicated above, under  xxxg1117xxx  receptor blockade, there
was still a heterogenous response to 5-ht to be observed.
the inhibitory component was accounted for by smooth
muscle 5-ht7 receptors. the remaining stimulatory response
to 5-ht might involve 5-ht2 receptors, as suggested by the
marked contraction increase due to the preferential 5-ht2
receptor agonist a-me-5-ht. this eect was mediated by

receptors located on nerves, as demonstrated by the lack of
eect of a-me-5-ht in the presence of ttx. in the presence
of atropine, contractions were blocked, but the subsequent
re-appearance of contractions after a-me-5-ht was remarkable and also seen to some extent with 5-ht, but not with
the other agonists tested. although this eect by either a- xxxd944xxx -ht or 5-ht was not signi®cant, it may suggest that either
the increase of acetylcholine release due to these agonists was
so great, that it partly surmounted the antagonism of
muscarinic cholinoceptors by atropine (1 mm), or that 5ht2 receptors are located on primarily cholinergic but to
some extent also on non-cholinergic ®bres. alternatively, a
non-5-ht-receptor mechanism may be involved. involvement
of 5-ht2a receptors in the a-me-5-ht-evoked contraction
increase is ruled out by the failure of  xxxd2419xxx  at selective 5ht2a receptor concentrations to antagonize the response to
a-me-5-ht. antagonism observed with the selective 5-ht2b
receptor antagonist sb-204741 (0.3 mm; forbes et al., 1995),
and the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists  xxxd2621xxx  (1 mm) and
mesulergine (0.1 mm) suggested interactions with 5-ht2b
receptors.
interestingly,  xxxd2419xxx  at 0.1 mm induced an increase of
contractions in its own right. the observation that
 xxxd2621xxx  itself increased contractions only in the
experiment with 5-ct, and was ineective in other
experiments (i.e. with 5-ht and a-me-5-ht), suggest that
there is across-animal variation in stimulation by these
antagonists. we do not have a clear explanation for these
observed eects. this property is most likely not related to
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonism, since  xxxd2419xxx  (10 nm, a
concentration that selectively antagonizes dog 5-ht2a
receptors; prins et al., 1997) did not increase these
contractions. the mechanisms involved, therefore, may be
associated with other than 5-ht receptor-related mechanisms. notwithstanding the putative relevance to stimulation of antral motility, this property did not appear to
contribute to elucidation of the action of 5-ht in this
bioassay, therefore, it was not further studied.
involvement of 5-ht3 receptors in the 5-ht-evoked
excitation is unlikely, as the  xxxg1116xxx  agonists 2- xxxd944xxx -ht and m-chlorophenylbiguanide did not aect efsinduced contractions. nevertheless, 5-ht did induce a

multiple 5-ht receptors in canine antrum

subordinate increase in contractions in the presence of
 xxxd2621xxx  and gr 113808 (blocking every 5-ht receptor
except  xxxg1116xxx ) as compared to solvent, and this eect
to 5-ht was not observed when granisetron was included as
well. it is more likely that the excitation due to activation of
 xxxg1114xxx  and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the muscle strips
tested was so strong, that the applied concentrations of
 xxxd2621xxx  and gr 113808 were insucient to completely
prevent the response to 5-ht. alternatively, if 5-ht3
receptors are indeed involved, their response is so weak, that
it may be anticipated that they play a role of minor
importance in antral longitudinal muscle motility.
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that canine isolated
antrum longitudinal muscle exhibits excitatory  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors on cholinergic nerves, excitatory 5-ht2b receptors
on primarily cholinergic nerves, and inhibitory (smooth
muscle) 5-ht7 receptors. the outcome of this study may
seem contradictive to our previous study of this tissue
showing that 5-ht-increased efs-induced contraction cannot be blocked by antagonism of 5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht3 or 5ht4 receptors (de ridder & schuurkes, 1993). in that study,
separate addition of  xxxd2419xxx  ( xxxg1113xxx  antagonist),
methiothepin (5-ht1, 5-ht2 and -contemporarily unknown5-ht7 receptor antagonist), granisetron ( xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist) or  xxxd3451xxx  (5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
antagonist), did not aect the response to 5-ht. that study
paralleled our ®nding that separate addition of antagonists
was ineective. pharmacologically knocking out  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor involvement only, might as such not prevent 5-ht
from increasing efs contractions via  xxxg1114xxx 
activation. vice versa, under  xxxg1114xxx  blocking
conditions, the 5-ht-induced increase will be taken over by
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor activation. hence, the conclusion that these
receptors are not involved in the 5-ht-induced response
appears understandable, however, is not true. additionally,
operational 5-ht7 receptors mediating relaxation and the
across- and within-dog variation in 5-ht responses displayed
in our study have made the characterization even more
dicult. here, the combination of antagonists and the use
of more selective 5-ht receptor ligands at appropriate
concentrations, allowed us to characterize the heterogenous
5-ht response in this tissue.
