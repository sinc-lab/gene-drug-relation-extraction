ischemic preconditioning in the hippocampus of a knockout mouse lacking  xxxg19xxx -based k(atp) channels.  atp-sensitive k+ (k(atp)) channels have been implicated in the mechanism of neuronal ischemic preconditioning. to evaluate the role of neuronal/beta-cell-type k(atp) channels,  xxxg19xxx  null (sur1ko) mice lacking (k(ir)6.x/ xxxg19xxx )(4) k(atp) channels were subjected to a preconditioning protocol with the use of double carotid occlusion.
