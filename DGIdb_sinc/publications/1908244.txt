abstract- xxxd2041xxx ,
and derivatives of  xxxd2041xxx  with a charged substituent at position 17 on
the estrogen moiety, have been investigated for their effects on bovine brain microtubules in oitro. the
negatively charged  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate has been found previously to be a microtubule-associated
protein (map)-dependent microtubule inhibitor [wallin m, deinum j and fridkn b, febs lett 179:
289-293, 19851. in the present study the binding of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate to map2 and tau was
investigated. both these maps were found to have two to three binding sites for  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate
which is compatible with the reported number of basic amino acid repeats of these maps, considered
to be the ultimate tubulin binding domains. the k,, for the binding of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate to map2
was estimated to be 20 pm at 4”, and for the binding of tau, 200 pm. the rate of dissociation was very
low (t1lz > 2 hr), which indicates that the binding of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate may stabilize the proteindrug complex by changing the protein conformation. two new negatively charged  xxxd2041xxx 
derivatives,  xxxd2041xxx  sulphate and  xxxd2041xxx  glucuronide, were found to be similar mapdependent microtubule inhibitors. the concentration for 50% inhibition of assembly was 100 pm for
the sulphate derivative, the same as found previously for  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate, and 250 pm for the
more bulky  xxxd2041xxx  glucuronide. a positively charged derivative,  xxxd2041xxx  sarcosinate, did
not inhibit microtubule assembly or alter the composition of the coassembled maps. the morphology
of the microtubules was, however, affected. the uncharged  xxxd2041xxx  bound to both tubulin and
maps, but no effects were seen on microtubule assembly, the composition of coassembled maps or
the microtubule morphology. our results suggest that only negatively charged  xxxd2041xxx  derivatives
have a map-dependent microtubule inhibitory effect. the two new negatively charged derivatives
could therefore be valuable tools in the study of tubulin-map interactions. the results also confirm
that these interactions between tubulin and maps are mainly electrostatic.

the microtubule-associated
proteins (maps$) are
highly diverse proteins [l] attached externally to the
tubulin structure.
two main categories
are usually
distinguished:
one of high molecular mass proteins
around 300 kda, map1 and map2; and one of
smaller proteins around 60 kda, called tau. these
proteins bind to tubulin and stimulate the assembly
of microtubules.
both map2 and tau bind to the
acidic c-terminals
of tubulin
[2]. moreover,
a
cationic tubulin-binding
domain common to the cterminals
of map2 and tau has been identified

recently [3-5 1, with a high degree of homology. this
tubulin-binding domain of both map2 and tau was
found to consist of three repetitive sequences of 18
amino acids [5] and to assemble with tubulin.
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate (fig. 1) has been found
previously to inhibit microtubule assembly in uitro
by binding to the microtubule-associated
proteins
[6-81. since classical anti-microtubule drugs, such as

colchicine and vinblastine, all bind to tubulin (for a
review see ref. 9), the main component
of
microtubules,  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate must belong
to a new group of microtubule inhibitors.
the existence of a common tubulin-binding
sequence in map2 and tau corresponds with our
previous results which show comparable inhibition
by  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate (50% inhibition
of
assembly at around loon)
of microtubules
reconstituted from tubulin with either map2, tau
or the tubulin binding fragment of chymotrypsindigested map2 [8]. the binding of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate was therefore localized to the tubulinbinding part of the maps. it is of interest to relate
the number of tubulin-binding sites with the number
of binding
sites for  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate.
preliminary results have shown that only a limited
number of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate molecules bind
to each map [8]. therefore, a more thorough
binding study of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate
was
performed.
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate differs from  xxxd2041xxx 
by only the phosphate group at position 17 of the
estrogen moiety (fig. 1). however, in the literature
the two molecules have been regarded as identical
with respect to interaction with the microtubule
system. this is probably not correct since these
two compounds have highly different polarities.

 xxxd2041xxx  to microtubule proteins was therefore
as well as its effect on
investigated
further,
microtubule assembly.
the phosphate group of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate
is negatively charged at ph 6.8, the ph used in our
in vitro assay. this suggests that the anionic
phosphate group is most probably involved in the
binding of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate to the cationic
tubulin-binding
domains of maps. in order to
determine if the charge of the substituent is of
importance for the effect on microtubules, three
other derivatives of  xxxd2041xxx  were studied (fig.
1). two negatively charged  xxxd2041xxx  derivatives,
 xxxd2041xxx  sulphate and  xxxd2041xxx  glucuronide,
and one positively charged derivative,  xxxd2041xxx 
sarcosinate, were used. their effects were compared
with the negatively charged  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate
and with the uncharged  xxxd2041xxx .
the effect of the compounds was found to be
charge-dependent.
only the negatively charged
 xxxd2041xxx  derivatives inhibited the assembly of
microtubules in an map-dependent way. our results
therefore provide further support for the finding that
the interaction between tubulin and maps is mainly
ionic.

the study of  xxxd2041xxx  sarcosinate 0.1 m mes,
0.5 mgs04, 1 mm gtp and 0.01% tween 20 were
used, since  xxxd2041xxx  sarcosinate precipitates in
pipes buffer. there was no obvious difference in the
characteristics of microtubule assembly between the
two systems. the assembly was started by addition
of concentrated
microtubule proteins at 4” to a
preheated buffer at 37”, or by addition of the buffermicrotubule protein solution to the measuring cell
at 37”. inhibitors or an equivalent amount of solvent
were either added from a stock solution to the buffer

with the proteins at 4”.

results

 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate binds specifically to map?
and tau

the binding of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate to both
map2 and tau, measured after 10 min of incubation
with the 3h-labelled compound, was found to be
saturable. this incubation time was chosen in order
to correlate the incorporation with the instantaneous
effect of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate on microtubule
assembly seen in vitro. furthermore,
preliminary
results show that the binding is rapid, since 50% of
the incorporation
 xxxd1891xxx  min is seen already after
1 min of incubation, and extension of the incubation
to 20 min increases the binding by only 20% (b.
friden, unpublished results). scatchard analysis gave
an approximate kd of 20 pm of 4” for the binding of
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate to map2, with 2.5 binding
sites (se = 0.2) (fig. 2a). the same results were
obtained if  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate with a different
specific activity was used.  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate
bound to isolated tau with a kd of approximately
200pm, with 1.5 binding sites (se = 0.5) (fig.
2b). analogous experiments with purified tubulin
confirmed earlier results [6] showing that only
negligible amounts, less than 0.05 mol  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate/m01 tubulin, were bound (not shown).

dissociates

in spite of the apparent low affinity of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate for map2, the drug-protein
complex
could be isolated. no significant dissociation of the
complex was observed during gel filtration, since no
tailing was seen. in order to estimate the dissociation
rate, the first isolated  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphatemap2 complex was incubated for a further 60 min
at 4” and the remaining
map2- xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate complex was isolated a second time by
the same gel filtration procedure. the amount of
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate bound to map2 decreased
herewith by only 28 -+ 16%) (n = 3). the dissociation
rate was thus very slow with ti/r > 2 hr. furthermore,
when the first isolated  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate-

999

map2 complex was incubated
with 1oopm
unlabelled  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate for 10 min, and
rechromatographed,
the amount of bound [3h] xxxd2041xxx  phosphate decreased by only 23 f 10%
(n = 3), further indicating a firm binding between
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate and map2.

was found to bind to tubulin
(0.2 f 0.1 mol/mol, n = 2), map2 (2.7 + l.omol/
mol, n = 4) and tau (1.0 ? 0.5 mol/mol, n = 4) at
4”. binding was not saturated in the range measured
(l-20 pm) (fig. 3a-c). it was not possible to
perform measurements at higher concentrations as
 xxxd2041xxx  precipitated.
assembled microtubules, incubated with 20 pm
 xxxd2041xxx 
for 10 min at 4” and assembled
thereafter at 37”, were found to bind 7.2 4 5.0 nmol
 xxxd2041xxx /mg microtubule protein (n = 4). however, no effect was seen on assembly kinetics or
extent of assembly when both turbidity (fig. 4) and
specific viscosity (not shown) were measured.
the critical concentration
for assembly, protein
composition of assembled microtubules and microtubule morphology (not shown) were unaffected
by 20 pm  xxxd2041xxx . measurement of all these
parameters showed clearly a lack of effect of
 xxxd2041xxx  on microtubule assembly in vitro.
phosphocellulose-purified
tubulin was incubated
with 20 ,um  xxxd2041xxx  for 10 min at 4” and was
assembled thereafter with taxol at 37”. a binding of
5.2 f 0.9 (n = 2) nmol  xxxd2041xxx /mg tubulin was
measured. this was higher than that measured when
 xxxd2041xxx  was added at steady state [2.0 5 0.1
(n = 2) nmol  xxxd2041xxx /mg
tubulin], showing
further that  xxxd2041xxx  does not affect microtubule
assembly.
no binding competition between  xxxd2041xxx  and
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate

addition of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate to microtubules at steady state, assembled in the presence of
20 pm  xxxd2041xxx , induced original, instantaneous
and complete disassembly similar to that occurring
in the absence of  xxxd2041xxx  (fig. 4). moreover,
the presence of  xxxd2041xxx  did not reduce the
incorporation
of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate
(not
shown), indicating that there is no competition
between the two substances.
anionic  xxxd2041xxx  derivatives inhibit microtubule
assembly
the effect of a negatively charged substituent at
position 17 of  xxxd2041xxx  on the inhibition of
microtubule assembly was studied further with two
anionic derivatives.
analogous

(pk, < -1) and  xxxd2041xxx  glucuronide (pk, =

at the ph of the assay, ph6.8. since neither the
sulphate or the glucuronide derivatives precipitated
in the presence of mg2+ , no addition of edta was
needed in the assembly assay. both derivatives
inhibited the assembly of microtubules with the same

(fig. 5a and b). in contrast to  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate,
disassembly
induced by these two
derivatives was lower when the drugs were added at
steady state, than when they were present initially.
the inhibition of microtubule assembly could be
reversed by taxol, indicating a map-dependent
effect. this was confirmed by sds-page (fig. 6),
since microtubules pelleted in the presence of 20 pm
taxol and either of the two drugs showed a reduction
in map content, dependent on the concentration of
the  xxxd2041xxx 
derivative.

required for 50% inhibition of assembly of 2 mg/ml
microtubule protein was approximately
100 and

inhibitor of microtubule assembly [6-g]. here we
found that two to three molecules of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate bound to each map2 with an apparent
kd of 2o@f at 4”. the number of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate molecules bound to tau was comparable,
between one and two drug molecules to each tau,
but with a lower kd, approximately 200~m. we
have reported previously that  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate

inhibits the assembly of tubulin via an interaction
with the tubulin-binding
part of map2 [8]. the
number of bound  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate molecules
measured suggests that it might bind to the small
repetitive cationic tubulin binding domains that

 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate is currently used in the
treatment of prostatic carcinoma, and upon oral
administration
is rapidly and almost completely
dephosphorylated
in the gut to  xxxd2041xxx  [20].
 xxxd2041xxx  has been shown to inhibit cell division
in metaphase [21,22] in a manner similar, but not
identical, to many microtubule-disrupting
drugs.
however,  xxxd2041xxx  induced only an abnormal
pattern of microtubules in cultured cells without any
effect on the amount of assembled microtubules
[23]. these results indicate that  xxxd2041xxx  has an
effect on microtubule-dependent
processes in the
cell but does not cause disassembly of microtubules
directly. we came to the same conclusion when
determining
the effect of  xxxd2041xxx 
on the
microtubule-dependent
axonal transport. transport
was inhibited but the microtubules were not obviously
broken down [7]. the effect of  xxxd2041xxx  in viuo
is, therefore, most probably distinct from that of
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate in uitro. our data indicate
that the two derivatives have different mechanisms
of action in vitro. we found that  xxxd2041xxx , in
contrast to  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate, binds to both
tubulin and maps as well as to assembled
microtubules
in vitro without any effect on
microtubule assembly. we were not, however, able
to determine dissociation constants for its binding
to tubulin or maps, because the binding was
unsaturable in the low solubility range (up to 20 pm).
moreover, microtubules assembled in the presence
of  xxxd2041xxx  disassembled as rapid and completely
as the control upon addition of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate and the binding of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate
was not suppressed by the presence of  xxxd2041xxx .
the results indicate that the two drugs do not
compete in binding to microtubule proteins.
after our report on the map dependency of
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate inhibition of microtubule
assembly, another group reported a similar effect of
 xxxd2041xxx  [24]. in order to reproduce this effect

the lines were drawn by linear

sequences of tau are not
completely homologous with those of map2. tau
is also known to form polymers [18] which might
hide the binding sites. as shown already [6], tubulin
bound only negligible amounts of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate, less than 0.05 mol/mol.
the  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate-protein
complex
could be isolated easily by gel filtration at 4” without
any obvious tailing [6], since the dissociation was
low (t112> 2 hr). the results suggest that the
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate-protein
complex was stabilized. both tau [18] and map2 are highly flexible
molecules [19] with a low degree of order, thus,
binding of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate may induce a
conformational change in map.

proteins were assembled as described in the legend to fig. 9, in the presence of 100@i  xxxd2041xxx 
sarcosinate, for 20 min and pelleted at steady state. the pellets (1) and supematants (2) were dissolved
in sample buffer and the protein composition was investigated by sds-page. negatively stained
microtubules, assembled in the absence (b) or presence (c) of 1oopmestramustine sarcosinate;
magnification x90,ocq.

and in an attempt to increase the concentration of
 xxxd2041xxx  to the reported levels, a number of
alterations to our in vitro system was performed.
however, it was not possible to reproduce any effect
of  xxxd2041xxx 
on either rat or bovine brain
microtubule assembly under their conditions. the
drastic use of 40% dmso, which was necessary to
increase the  xxxd2041xxx  concentration to 100 pm,
was also without effect (not shown). the reason for
this discrepancy is unknown.
the effects of  xxxd2041xxx  derivatives were found
to be charge-dependent.
the map-dependent
inhibition of microtubule assembly by the charged
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate, -sulphate and -glucuronide
clearly shows the importance of an ionic group at
position 17 of the estrogen moiety.  xxxd2041xxx 
glucuronide, with the larger substituent, was less
potent than  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate and  xxxd2041xxx 
sulphate, suggesting that steric effects also are of
importance. the charge of the substituent must be
negative for a map-dependent
effect, since when
the positively charged  xxxd2041xxx  sarcosinate was
used the effect on microtubules was completely
different. the assembly was not inhibited but the
turbidity increased due to an alteration in the
microtubule structure. the tubulin-maps
interactions seemed however to be intact, since the ratio
of maps to tubulin in the polymer was the same.
the two derivatives probably bind to different sites,
since  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate could induce rapid
disassembly in the presence of 100 pm  xxxd2041xxx 
sarcosinate. our results are therefore in accordance

with the previous finding that the maps are attached
to tubulin mainly by cationic bonds. these bonds
are known to be broken by an elevated ionic strength,
polyanions like heparin or with negatively charged
polyamino acids [25-271. the importance of a
negatively charged substituent at position 17 of the
 xxxd2041xxx 
molecule for the interruption
of
the tubulin-maps
association in vitro, supports
furthermore the observation that the uncharged
 xxxd2041xxx  does not affect the tubulin-maps
interaction.
another mechanism
of action for
 xxxd2041xxx  in vivo is therefore probable.
our study shows that  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate is a
valuable chemical tool for the in vitro study of
microtubules. however, it is of limited value for in
vivo and cellular studies because it precipitates in
the presence of divalent cations and is rapidly
dephosphorylated both in the body and in many cell
cultures. the existence of two new drugs which do
not precipitate in the presence of divalent cations
and have a similar map-dependent
mechanism of
action to that of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate,
has
therefore further advantages in the study of
microtubules and the role of maps.
note added in proof-after submission of this manuscript,
a binding study of estrarnustine phosphate to chick brain
map2, has been published by dr r. g. bums, confirming
our results (bums rg, stoichiometry of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate binding to map2 measured by the disassembly
of chick brain map2: tubulin microtubules, cell motility
cytoskeleton 17: 167-173, 1990).
