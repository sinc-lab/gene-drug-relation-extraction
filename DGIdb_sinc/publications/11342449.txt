antibody-targeted chemotherapy is a
promising therapy in patients with acute
myeloid leukemia (aml). in a phase ii
study of  xxxd2190xxx  ( xxxd2190xxx , gemtuzumab
ozogamicin), which consists of a  xxxg382xxx 
antibody linked to calicheamicin, saturation and internalization by leukemic and
normal myeloid cells were analyzed in
122 patients with relapsed aml. peripheral blood samples were obtained just
before and 3 and 6 hours after the start of
the first and second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment
cycles. within 3 to 6 hours after infusion,
near complete saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites by  xxxd2190xxx  was reached for

aml blasts, monocytes, and granulocytes, whereas  xxxd2190xxx  did not bind to
lymphocytes. saturation levels prior to
the start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle were significantly increased
compared with background levels before
the start of the first cycle. this apparently
was caused by remaining circulating  xxxd2190xxx  from the first treatment cycle (⬃2
weeks earlier). on binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to
the  xxxg382xxx  antigen,  xxxd2190xxx  was rapidly
internalized, as determined by the decrease in maximal surface membrane  xxxd2190xxx  binding. internalization of  xxxd2190xxx 
was also demonstrated in myeloid cells in

vitro and was confirmed by confocal laser
microscopy. in vitro studies using pulse
labeling with  xxxd2190xxx  showed a continuous
renewed membrane expression of  xxxg382xxx  antigens, which can significantly increase the
internalization process and thereby the intracellular accumulation of the drug. finally,
 xxxd2190xxx  induced dose-dependent apoptosis in myeloid cells in vitro. these data
indicate that  xxxd2190xxx  is rapidly and specifically targeted to cd33ⴙ cells, followed by
internalization and subsequent induction of
cell death. (blood. 2001;97:3197-3204)

introduction
although 70% to 80% of adult patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (aml) can be successfully induced into first remission
by chemotherapy, most of these patients ultimately have a relapse
within 2 years.1 in addition, chemotherapy is accompanied by
substantial side effects because the cytotoxic drugs not only kill the
leukemic cells but also dividing cells of other hematopoietic and
nonhematopoietic lineages. therefore, it is clear that new or
additional therapy approaches are required. a promising therapy is
antibody-targeted chemotherapy, in which the cytotoxic agent is
linked to an antibody recognizing the leukemic cells.2 such an
approach allows the specific delivery of the cytotoxic drug to the
leukemic cells and is likely to result in less toxic side effects.
in aml, the  xxxg382xxx  antigen is an appropriate target because
aml blast cells express the  xxxg382xxx  antigen in more than 90% of
patients, whereas hematopoietic stem cells, lymphoid cells, and
nonhematopoietic cells do not express the  xxxg382xxx  antigen.3-5 the
 xxxg382xxx  antigen, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is a
membrane-bound glycoprotein of 67 kd. although it has been
shown that the  xxxg382xxx  antigen is a sialic acid-binding receptor,6,7 its
function on myeloid cells remains to be established.
 xxxd2190xxx  ( xxxd2190xxx , previously known as cma676) is an antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent consisting of the
humanized murine  xxxg382xxx  antibody (clone p67.6) to which the

calicheamicin ␥1 derivative is attached via a hydrolyzable bifunctional linker.8 it is assumed that binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to the  xxxg382xxx 
antigen results in internalization followed by the release of the
potent antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. calicheamicin is a
member of the enediyne family of molecules and binds to the minor
groove of dna, causing double-strand breaks and apoptosis.9,10
however, there is no direct proof thus far that the antitumor effect
of  xxxd2190xxx  therapy is indeed mediated by this mechanism.
recently,  xxxd2190xxx  was tested for the treatment of relapsed or
refractory aml in a phase i dose-escalation study.11 in 8 of 40
patients, complete disappearance of leukemic cells was observed,
and  xxxd2190xxx  was reasonably well tolerated, even at the highest
dose of 9 mg/m2. in the phase ii studies on  xxxd2190xxx , we analyzed
the saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites by  xxxd2190xxx  on  xxxg382xxx ⫹ aml
blast cells as well as on normal leukocytes. in addition, we
investigated whether and to what extent  xxxd2190xxx  is internalized by
 xxxg382xxx ⫹ cells. the processes of saturation and internalization are
both crucial for determining the amount of calicheamicin delivered
into the leukemic cells, and thus probably also for the killing of
these cells.
in this report, we present data on the in vivo and in vitro binding
of  xxxd2190xxx  to leukemic and normal  xxxg382xxx ⫹ myeloid cells. in
addition, we provide evidence that on binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to the

 xxxg382xxx  antigen, the complex is rapidly internalized and that this
internalization process continues because of renewed expression of
 xxxg382xxx  antigens on the cellular surface. finally, we show that
internalization of  xxxd2190xxx  results in the dose-dependent induction
of apoptosis.

patients, materials, and methods
patients
european patients (n ⫽ 122) with aml in first relapse, enrolled in the
european phase ii  xxxd2190xxx  protocols 0903b1-202-eu (n ⫽ 76) and
0903b1-203-eu (n ⫽ 46) between august 1998 and march 2000, were
included in this study. patients included in the 202-eu study were more
than 18 years old and had a first remission duration of at least 6 months.
patients included in the 203-eu study were more than 60 years old and had
a first remission duration of at least 3 months. all patients were required to
have  xxxg382xxx ⫹ aml as determined by immunophenotyping (see below) of a
bone marrow (bm) aspirate obtained within 1 week before the start of the
 xxxd2190xxx  therapy. the aml was considered to be  xxxg382xxx ⫹ if at least 80% of
the myeloid blast cells expressed the  xxxg382xxx  antigen in sufficient amounts;
that is, the fluorescence intensity of the  xxxg382xxx  labeling was at least 4 times
as high as the fluorescence intensity of an isotype-matched control
antibody. informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance
with the institutional review boards of the participating clinical sites.
protocol
in these open, single-arm multicenter phase ii studies,  xxxd2190xxx  (wyethayerst laboratories, st davids, pa) was administered as a single 2-hour
intravenous infusion at a dose of 9 mg/m2. in general, each patient received
2  xxxd2190xxx  doses with at least 14 days between the doses. a delay of the
second dose beyond 14 days was allowed for acute treatment of infections
and other medical problems. before the start of each  xxxd2190xxx  treatment
cycle and 3 and 6 hours after the start of each  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle,
peripheral blood (pb) samples were obtained, immediately placed on ice
(4°c) and shipped overnight at 4°c to immunology rotterdam by express
courier (world courier, hoofddorp, the netherlands). before the start of
the first and, in a limited number of patients, before the start of the second
 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle, serum samples were obtained and shipped
overnight on dry ice to immunology rotterdam by express courier.
immunophenotyping
the bm samples of all 122 aml patients were immunophenotyped as
described previously.11,12 briefly, 100 ␮l whole bm was incubated with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc), phycoerythrin (pe), and peridin chlorophyll protein (percp)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (bd biosciences,
san jose, ca) for 20 minutes at room temperature. after lysing red blood
cells (rbcs) by ammonium chloride (10 minutes at room temperature) and
washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline ph 7.8 (pbs)/0.2%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa), at least 10 000 events were acquired on a
facscan flow cytometer (bd biosciences). data were analyzed by using
cellquest software (bd biosciences).
cell lines, mononuclear cells, and monocytes
the myeloid cell lines hl-6013 and meg-0114 were cultured in rpmi
(bio-whittaker, verviers, belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (fcs; bio-whittaker),  xxxd2871xxx  sodium (100 u/ml; gistbrocades, delft, the netherlands) and streptomycin sulfate (0.1 mg/ml;
biochrom, berlin, germany). mononuclear cells (mncs) were obtained by
 xxxd3253xxx -paque (pharmacia, uppsala, sweden) density centrifugation of pb.
monocytes were obtained after  xxxd3253xxx -paque and percoll (pharmacia)
density centrifugation of buffy coats as described previously.15
in vitro incubation of cells with  xxxd2190xxx 
for continuous-labeling experiments, whole pb or bm (100 ␮l) was
incubated with 5 ␮g/ml  xxxd2190xxx  (unless indicated otherwise; doses and

blood, 15 may 2001 䡠 volume 97, number 10

concentrations of  xxxd2190xxx  are reported with respect to its protein portion,
which comprises 97% of the molecule) at 37°c for different periods of time,
after which rbcs were lysed by ammonium chloride (10 minutes, 4°c).
after washing the leukocytes with pbs/2% fcs, the cell suspension was
used for analysis of saturation and modulation (see below). mncs,
monocytes, and cell lines were suspended in rpmi/10% fcs at a
concentration of 2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml and incubated with 5 ␮g/ml  xxxd2190xxx 
(unless indicated otherwise) at 37°c for different periods of time. after
washing the cells with pbs/2% fcs, the cell suspension was used for
analysis of saturation and modulation.
for pulse-labeling experiments, cells were incubated with  xxxd2190xxx  (5
␮g/ml) at 37°c for 15 minutes, after which nonbound  xxxd2190xxx  was
removed by washing the cells with rpmi. the cell pellet was suspended in
rpmi/10% fcs (2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml) and incubated at 37°c for different
periods of time, after which the cells were used for analysis of saturation
and modulation.
to analyze whether  xxxd2190xxx  present in patient serum could still bind to
myeloid cells, monocytes (0.25 ⫻ 106) were incubated with 500 ␮l serum
obtained from patients just before the start of the first or second  xxxd2190xxx 
treatment cycle. serum obtained from healthy controls was used as a
negative control, whereas serum obtained just after start of the  xxxd2190xxx 
treatment was used as a positive control. after incubation at 4°c for 1 hour,
the monocytes were washed twice with pbs/2% fcs, after which they were
used for analysis of saturation.
saturation and modulation analysis
after in vivo or in vitro exposure to  xxxd2190xxx  or in vitro incubation with
patient serum, cell suspensions (rbc-lysed whole pb, rbc-lysed whole
bm, mncs, monocytes, or cell lines) were diluted in pbs/2% fcs to
2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml. to detect  xxxd2190xxx  bound to the cells, cells were
incubated with biotin-conjugated mouse antihuman igg4 antibodies (caltag
laboratories, burlingame, ca), followed by streptavidin-fitc (biosource,
nivelles, belgium) as a second-step reagent. to detect maximal  xxxd2190xxx 
binding, cells were first incubated with excess  xxxd2190xxx  (final concentration: 10 ␮g/ml), followed by successive incubation with biotin-conjugated
mouse antihuman igg4 antibodies and streptavidin-fitc. as a negative
control, cells were incubated with streptavidin-fitc alone. to detect  xxxg382xxx 
antigenic sites not occupied by  xxxd2190xxx , cells were incubated with
 xxxg382xxx -pe (clone p67.6; bd biosciences) or, as a negative control, igg1-pe
(bd biosciences). to improve separate analysis of different leukocyte
subsets, cd45-percp (clone 2d1; bd biosciences) was added to each
patient sample from april 1999 onward. all incubations were done for 20
minutes at 4°c (to prevent internalization during immunostaining) and were
followed by washing the cells twice with pbs/2% fcs. data on at least
10 000 events were acquired on a facscan flow cytometer and analyzed by
using cellquest software.
saturation was defined as (specific fluorescence intensity of bound
 xxxd2190xxx )/(specific fluorescence intensity maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding)
⫻ 100%. modulation was defined as 1⫺(specific fluorescence intensity
maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding at time point x)/(specific fluorescence intensity
maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding at time point 0) ⫻ 100%, in which time point 0
is the time point just before infusion of  xxxd2190xxx  in patients or just before
addition of  xxxd2190xxx  to cell or blood suspensions. analysis was performed
on each individual leukocyte population, as defined by scatter characteristics or cd45 expression levels or both.12,16 for analysis of saturation and
modulation by purified monocytes, cells were gated based on staining with
cd14-pe or cd14-fitc.
the percentage of aml blast cells present in pb samples obtained just
before the start of the first and second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle was
determined by flow cytometric analysis.12,16 if less than 5% blast cells were
present in the pb sample, generally no reliable saturation data could
be obtained.
confocal laser microscopy
the myeloid cell line meg-01 (0.4 ⫻ 106 cells) was incubated with the
fitc-conjugated  xxxg382xxx  antibody p67.6 (bd biosciences). after incubation
at 37°c for various periods of time, the cells were washed twice with
pbs/bsa and suspended in pbs/bsa. the cells were then incubated (4°c,

20 minutes) with  xxxg163xxx  (bd biosciences), washed twice, and incubated
(4°c, 20 minutes) with tetramethyl rhodamine-conjugated goat antimouse
antibodies (g␣m-tritc; central laboratory of the blood transfusion
service, amsterdam, the netherlands). after washing the cells twice,
suspension preparations were made in vectashield (vector laboratories,
burlingame, ca). the suspension preparations were analyzed on a zeiss
lsm 410 laser-scanning confocal microscope (zeiss, oberkochen, germany).17 the 488-nm line of an argon laser and the 543-nm line of a
helium-neon laser were used for the excitation of the fitc and tritc
labels, respectively. emission spectra of both labels were separated with a
560-nm beam splitter and passed through a 510- to 540-nm band pass filter
(fitc) or a more than 570 nm long pass filter (tritc). images were taken
at optimal lateral resolution (pixel size 104 nm). cross sections (perpendicular to the cover slip) were imaged with an axial (␨) pixel size of 104 nm.
detection of apoptosis
apoptosis was analyzed by labeling the cells with  xxxg166xxx -fitc and
 xxxd3027xxx  (pi)18 using the iqp apoptosis kit (immunoquality
products, groningen, the netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.  xxxg166xxx  stains phosphatidylserine residues that normally
are present in the inner cell membrane only, whereas apoptotic cells express
them on the outer cell membrane as well. therefore, the combination of
 xxxg166xxx  and dna staining by pi allows the discrimination between
nonpermeable apoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫹, pi⫺) and permeable lateapoptotic/necrotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫹, pi⫹).
statistical analysis
data were analyzed as of march 31, 2000. differences in maximal  xxxd2190xxx 
binding, saturation, and modulation between different leukocyte subsets
were determined by using the unpaired student t test, whereas differences in
maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding, saturation, and internalization between the first
and second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle were determined by the paired
student t test (unless indicated otherwise). the mann-whitney u test was
used to determine differences in the in vitro saturation and modulation
processes. in all tests, a p value of less than .05 was considered significant.

results
maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding to leukocytes

we first investigated the maximal binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to different
leukocyte subsets. blood samples from patients were obtained just
before the start of the  xxxd2190xxx  infusion (t ⫽ 0) and maximal
 xxxd2190xxx  binding was analyzed by incubating the cells with an
excess of  xxxd2190xxx  in vitro.  xxxd2190xxx  bound to myeloid blast cells
(range: 16.6-86.8 arbitrary units) and monocytes (range: 26.0113.0), whereas the binding to granulocytes was significantly less
(range: 8.3-41.9; figure 1a). barely detectable amounts of  xxxd2190xxx  bound to lymphocytes. the maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding to pb
blast cells was related to the level of  xxxg382xxx  expression by bm blast
cell as was analyzed for inclusion of the aml patients into the
 xxxd2190xxx  protocol (r ⫽ 0.64; p ⬍ .05).
for monocytes and granulocytes, the maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding before the start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle was
similar to the maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding before the start of the first
 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle (figure 1a). in contrast, the mean
maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding to myeloid blast cells before the start of
the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle was significantly reduced as
compared to the mean maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding before the start
of the first cycle.
because reliable  xxxd2190xxx  binding data could, in general, not be
obtained if the percentage of blast cells in the pb was less than 5%,
the mean maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding at cycle 2 was obtained from
only those patients with still more than 5% blasts in their pb. we

figure 1. maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding to leukocyte subsets. maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding
to different leukocyte subsets was analyzed prior to start of the first (hatched bars) and
second (open bars)  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle by incubating pb with an excess of  xxxd2190xxx 
in vitro, followed by detection with biotin-conjugated antihuman igg4 and streptavidinfitc. (a) maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding to aml blast cells (cycle 1: n ⫽ 86; cycle 2: n ⫽ 35),
monocytes (n ⫽ 33; n ⫽ 45), granulocytes (n ⫽ 55; n ⫽ 32), and lymphocytes (n ⫽ 61;
n ⫽ 43). patient numbers differ between leukocyte subsets and between cycle 1 and cycle
2 because not all patients received a second treatment cycle, in some patients the pb
sample was not available or of too low quality, or too few events were available for a reliable
analysis of all leukocyte subsets. (b) maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding to aml blast cells from
patients showing less than 5% blast cells in their pb just prior to the start of the second
treatment cycle (blast cell reducers; n ⫽ 27) or 5% or more blasts in pb (blast cell
nonreducers; n ⫽ 31 and n ⫽ 26 for cycle 1 and cycle 2, respectively). maximal  xxxd2190xxx 
binding data for cycle 2 could not be obtained in the blast cell reducers, because the
number of blast cells was too low to perform a reliable analysis. nd indicates no data. data
are expressed as mean ⫾ sd. significant differences (p ⬍ .05; indicated by the asterisks
[unpaired t test]) were observed in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding to blast cells between cycle 1
and cycle 2 and between cycle 1 data of the blast cell reducers and blast cell nonreducers.

therefore hypothesized that the observed decrease in mean maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding at the start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment
cycle was related to disappearance of pb blast cells (to ⬍ 5%)
during the first  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle in those patients with blast
cells expressing high levels of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites (ie, high
maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding). we defined these patients as “blast cell
reducers,” whereas patients with 5% or more blast cells in their pb
at the start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle were defined as
“blast cell nonreducers.” indeed, before the first  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle, blast cells from the blast cell reducers bound significantly more  xxxd2190xxx  than blast cells from the blast cell nonreducers (figure 1b). thus, patients with high maximal  xxxd2190xxx 
binding on their blast cells appeared to show a more profound
disappearance of blast cells from their pb. as a consequence, the
mean maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding at cycle 1, obtained from all

 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle also showed a high in vitro saturation,
whereas patients with low in vivo saturation levels (⬍ 15%) before
the start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle also showed a low
in vitro saturation (figure 3). incubation of monocytes with serum
obtained just after the start of  xxxd2190xxx  treatment resulted in
complete saturation, whereas incubation with serum obtained from
healthy volunteers resulted in background saturation levels (⬍ 10%).
these results indicate that the increased saturation observed before
the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle is indeed caused by circulating  xxxd2190xxx  remaining from the first treatment cycle, generally
given 2 weeks earlier.

just before and 3 and 6 hours after the start of each  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle was
analyzed by comparing  xxxd2190xxx  bound in vivo with the maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding.
the different myeloid cells were determined by their scatter and cd45-binding
characteristics: aml blast cells (hatched bars; cycle 1: n ⫽ 86; cycle 2: n ⫽ 35),
monocytes (gray bars; n ⫽ 33; n ⫽ 45), and granulocytes (white bars; n ⫽ 55;

between cycle 1 and cycle 2 at the 0-hour time point.

patients, was higher than the mean maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding at
cycle 2, which could only be obtained from blast cell nonreducers
(figure 1a). in the latter group, the mean maximal  xxxd2190xxx 
binding before the start of the first and second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment
cycle was similar (figure 1b).
saturation of  xxxd2190xxx  in vivo

to analyze the binding of infused  xxxd2190xxx  to leukemic and normal
myeloid cells, pb samples were obtained just before infusion of
 xxxd2190xxx  and 3 and 6 hours after the start of each  xxxd2190xxx 
treatment cycle. before the start of the first  xxxd2190xxx  treatment
cycle, only background saturation levels were observed (figure 2).
however, 3 and 6 hours after start of the first  xxxd2190xxx  infusion,
near-complete saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites on the 3 investigated types of  xxxg382xxx ⫹ myeloid cells was observed (figure 2).
before the start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle, significantly increased saturation levels were observed on blast cells,
monocytes, and granulocytes as compared to the background
saturation levels before the start of the first  xxxd2190xxx  treatment
cycle. three and 6 hours after the start of the second  xxxd2190xxx 
treatment cycle, near-complete saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites
was observed again. overall, these data indicate that the  xxxd2190xxx 
dosage used (9 mg/m2) is sufficient to saturate  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites
on leukemic and normal  xxxg382xxx ⫹ cells in pb.
the saturation levels detected before the start of the second
 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle suggest that  xxxd2190xxx  remaining from the
first  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle is still circulating and able to bind to
the  xxxg382xxx -expressing cells. to investigate this hypothesis, monocytes obtained from healthy controls were incubated with serum
obtained from patients just before start of the first or second
 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle, after which saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic
sites was analyzed. as shown in figure 3, serum obtained prior to
cycle 1 did not result in significant saturation levels. in contrast,
incubation with serum obtained just prior to the second  xxxd2190xxx 
treatment cycle resulted in significantly increased saturation levels.
these levels of in vitro saturation were related to the saturation
observed in the in vivo pb samples obtained before the second
 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle; that is, serum from patients with high in
vivo saturation levels (⬎ 30%) before the start of the second

we then hypothesized that  xxxd2190xxx , after binding to the myeloid
cells, is internalized into the cells and thus would cause a decrease
in  xxxg382xxx  expression and in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding. we
therefore evaluated this modulation, which we defined as the
decrease in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding over time, relative to the
maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding just prior to exposure of the cells to
 xxxd2190xxx . three hours after starting the first  xxxd2190xxx  treatment
cycle, rapid modulation of  xxxd2190xxx  (25%-30%) was observed
(figure 4). six hours after the start of the  xxxd2190xxx  infusion,
modulation by myeloid blast cells and monocytes showed a limited
(but statistically significant) increase (to 30%-40%), whereas no
further modulation by granulocytes was observed (figure 4). also
after the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle, rapid modulation was
observed (figure 4). the levels and kinetics of modulation were
comparable between both  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycles. these data
support the assumption that after binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to the  xxxg382xxx 
antigen present on leukemic and normal myeloid cells, the
antibody-antigen complex is down-modulated and thus may become internalized.
internalization of  xxxd2190xxx  in vitro

figure 4. modulation of  xxxd2190xxx  by myeloid cells in vivo. modulation of  xxxd2190xxx 
was analyzed 3 and 6 hours after the start of each  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle by
comparing the maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding at each time point with the maximal
 xxxd2190xxx  binding just before the start of the corresponding treatment cycle. the
different myeloid cells were analyzed separately, based on their scatter or cd45binding characteristics: aml blast cells (hatched bars; cycle 1: n ⫽ 86; cycle 2:
n ⫽ 34), monocytes (gray bars; n ⫽ 33; n ⫽ 45), and granulocytes (white bars;
n ⫽ 54; n ⫽ 32).

biologic mechanisms (eg, shedding of antigens or trapping of cells
with high  xxxd2190xxx  binding in the spleen), we analyzed downmodulation in vitro. purified monocytes, whole blood (both from
healthy controls), whole bm from an aml patient, and the
myeloid cell lines meg-01 and hl-60 were incubated with
 xxxd2190xxx . the results showed a rapid saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic
sites. in addition, we observed a clear decrease in the maximal
 xxxd2190xxx  binding over time, implying that down-modulation
occurred. representative results for monocytes are shown in figure
5. no decrease in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding over time was
observed when monocytes were incubated at 4°c (data not shown).
to further demonstrate that internalization occurs, meg-01
cells were incubated with the fitc-labeled  xxxg382xxx  antibody p67.6.
this antibody is the murine version of the humanized antibody
used in  xxxd2190xxx  and behaves comparably in in vitro saturation/
modulation analysis. meg-01 cells were chosen because they
show similar saturation and modulation behavior as monocytes, but
are larger, thereby making them more suitable for analysis by
confocal laser microscopy. a  xxxg163xxx  antibody was used as a positive
control for the visualization of the cell membrane. as shown in
figure 6, incubation of meg-01 cells with p67.6-fitc resulted in
a clear membrane-bound staining pattern. however, after incubation at 37°c, a clear shift in the distribution of p67.6 occurred; after
0.5 hours the antibody was detected in the majority of the cells both
on the cell membrane and in intracellular locations, whereas after 3
hours the majority of the antibody had become internalized. after
incubation for 24 hours at 37°c, only low levels of intracellular
antibody were detected, which may be due to degradation or to
quenching of the fluorochrome by the low ph in lysosomes that are
assumed to fuse with the endosomes containing internalized
antibody. these in vitro experiments demonstrate that  xxxd2190xxx 
can indeed efficiently be internalized by cells expressing  xxxg382xxx .
continuous renewed expression of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites
promotes internalization of  xxxd2190xxx 

binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites on leukemic and
normal myeloid cells and subsequent internalization of the antibodyantigen complex are dynamic processes. we hypothesized that after
internalization of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites, new  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites

targeting of  xxxd2190xxx  to aml blast cells

might be expressed on the cell membrane, which may again bind
 xxxd2190xxx  and subsequently be internalized. to test this hypothesis,
monocytes, aml blast cells, and myeloid cell lines (hl-60 and
meg-01) were pulse labeled with  xxxd2190xxx . after 15 minutes of
labeling, resulting in a virtually complete saturation of  xxxg382xxx 
antigenic sites, nonbound  xxxd2190xxx  was washed away and the cells
were incubated at 37°c for several periods of time. as shown in
figure 5 for monocytes, saturation levels gradually decreased,
indicating the appearance of empty  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites. furthermore, modulation observed after pulse labeling was significantly
decreased compared to modulation observed after continuous
exposure of monocytes to  xxxd2190xxx . comparable data were found
for the other myeloid cells analyzed. these data suggest that new
 xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites are expressed on the cell membrane after
binding and subsequent internalization of  xxxd2190xxx  and that this
renewed expression of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites contributes significantly to the amount of internalized  xxxd2190xxx .
 xxxd2190xxx  induces apoptosis in myeloid cells in vitro

finally, we analyzed whether binding and subsequent internalization of  xxxd2190xxx  resulted in apoptosis of the myeloid cells. three
and 6 hours after the start of each  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle, we did
not detect apoptotic cells in pb samples of aml patients. in
addition,  xxxd2190xxx  treatment did not appear to activate myeloid
cells, as assessed by the stable expression of several markers that
are related to activation of myeloid cells (cd16, cd32,  xxxg770xxx ,
cd66, hla-dr). in accordance with these in vivo data, we also
did not observe increased numbers of apoptotic cells in monocytes
and the myeloid cell line hl-60 after culturing these cells with
 xxxd2190xxx  for 24 or 48 hours. however, a dose-dependent increase
in the percentage of early apoptotic ( xxxg166xxx ⫹/pi⫺) and late
apoptotic/necrotic ( xxxg166xxx ⫹/pi⫹) cells was observed after
culturing monocytes (figure 7), aml blast cells (data not shown),
or hl-60 cells (table 1) with  xxxd2190xxx  for 72 and 96 hours. in
contrast, no increased apoptosis was detected in lymphocytes
cultured in the presence of  xxxd2190xxx  for up to 96 hours. in vivo
samples were not available from comparable time points. these
data indicate that  xxxd2190xxx  is able to induce cell death, in part by
apoptosis, selectively in  xxxg382xxx -expressing cells.

discussion
this study demonstrates that  xxxd2190xxx , given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, rapidly binds to  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites expressed on
leukemic and normal myeloid cells in blood, but not to lymphocytes. the applied  xxxd2190xxx  dose of 9 mg/m2 results in nearcomplete saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites within 3 hours after the
start of the 2-hour infusion. furthermore, we show that  xxxd2190xxx  is
rapidly internalized after binding to  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites, both in
vivo and in vitro. continuous renewed expression of  xxxg382xxx 
antigens on the cellular surface of myeloid cells was observed,
which significantly increased the amount of internalized  xxxd2190xxx .
finally, we demonstrate that  xxxd2190xxx  binding and internalization
results in the induction of cell death in  xxxg382xxx ⫹ myeloid cells.
the mean maximal binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to myeloid blast cells
was comparable to the maximal binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to monocytes,
whereas the maximal binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to granulocytes was
significantly lower and no significant binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to
lymphocytes was observed. these data are in accordance with the
known expression levels of the  xxxg382xxx  antigen on these cells.3-5 the
122 relapsed aml patients included in this study all had  xxxg382xxx ⫹
blast cells, although the level of  xxxg382xxx  expression varied (from 5.9
to 210.9 times over background). interestingly, it appeared that
patients with less than 5% blasts cells in their pb just prior to the

start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle showed significantly
higher maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding levels prior to start of the first
 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle as compared with patients with 5% or
more blasts in their pb just prior to the start of the second cycle
(figure 1b). these data suggest that high expression levels of
 xxxg382xxx , and consequently high maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding and large
amounts of internalized  xxxd2190xxx , are related to a more efficient
clearance of myeloid blast cells from the pb. it will be of interest to
analyze whether  xxxg382xxx  expression levels are also related to the
clearance of myeloid blasts from the bm, but these data are not yet
fully available. however, preliminary multivariate analysis shows
that  xxxg382xxx  expression levels are not correlated with response or
overall survival (unpublished results).
as suggested in the limited number of patients in the phase i
study, a near-complete saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites was
reached with the 9 mg/m2 dose, both at the first and the second
 xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle.11 in agreement with these results,
near-complete saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites was observed in a
clinical study with the  xxxg382xxx  antibody m195 administered in a
comparable dose (3 mg/m2).19 in our study, saturation levels just
before start of the second cycle were still relatively high. this
appeared to be caused by circulating  xxxd2190xxx , apparently remaining from the first treatment cycle. pharmacokinetic data have
shown that the mean half-life of  xxxd2190xxx  is 72 hours.20 this would
theoretically mean that  xxxd2190xxx  will still be present in the blood at
the start of the second treatment cycle (in general 14 days after the
start of the first cycle) at a concentration comparable with a dose of

approximately 0.3 mg/m2. as shown in the  xxxd2190xxx  phase i study,
patients treated with 0.25 mg/m2  xxxd2190xxx  have 20% to 50%
saturation of  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites on their pb blast cells.11 these
percentages are comparable to the saturation levels we have found
in the in vivo saturation study before cycle 2 and the in vitro
saturation study using serum obtained from patients just before the
start of the second  xxxd2190xxx  treatment cycle (figures 2 and 3).
after binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites in vivo, the
complex is rapidly modulated (⬃40% at 6 hours). we defined this
in vivo modulation as the decrease in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding
over time, and thereby did not directly measure intracellular
 xxxd2190xxx . one may argue that this decrease in maximal  xxxd2190xxx 
binding is not due to internalization, but to other immunobiologic
mechanisms. however, several experiments support our assumption that the decrease in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding is due to
internalization. first, the number of myeloid blast cells did not
significantly change during the first 6 hours after the start of the
infusion, suggesting that there is no removal of cells from the
leukemic blast cell population (data not shown). second, modulation was also observed in several myeloid cell types in vitro. third,
no decrease in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding was observed when cells
were kept at 4°c (eg, during overnight transportation of the
samples from the clinical site to the central laboratory) in contrast
to the decrease in maximal  xxxd2190xxx  binding observed with
incubation at 37°c. finally, in the  xxxg382xxx ⫹ myeloid cell line
meg-01, confocal laser microscopy demonstrated internalization
of the  xxxg382xxx  antibody p67.6, which has exactly the same antigen
specificity of  xxxd2190xxx  (figure 6).
modulation of  xxxg382xxx  antibodies has also been demonstrated in
previous in vitro studies using radiolabeled  xxxg382xxx  antibodies
(m195, p67.6).21-23 in agreement with our results, approximately
40% modulation was observed after 3 to 6 hours,21,23 and it was
suggested that after endocytosis the antibody is routed to lysosomes, where it is proteolytically degraded.22 in a phase i trial of
131i-labeled m195, modulation was also observed in vivo as
determined by comparing the counts per minute before and after
washing with acid to remove membrane-bound m195.19,24 however, it should be noted that radionuclides (especially 131i) may be
rapidly excreted from the cells after lysosomal catabolism of
antibodies.24
modulation was comparable between myeloid blast cells and
monocytes, but granulocytes seemed to behave somewhat differently, because there was no further increase in the level of
modulation between 3 and 6 hours after the start of the  xxxd2190xxx 
infusion. this is probably due to the recruitment of granulocytes
from the bm into the pb, because the percentage of (mainly
immature) granulocytes significantly increased between 3 and 6
hours after the start of the infusion (data not shown). it may be that
penetration of  xxxd2190xxx  into the bm is slightly delayed as
compared to the presence of  xxxd2190xxx  in the pb. as a result, the
newly recruited granulocytes may have had a delayed binding of
 xxxd2190xxx  and thereby a delayed modulation.
the results of our pulse-labeling experiments suggest that, after
internalization of  xxxd2190xxx  bound to the  xxxg382xxx  antigen, renewed
expression of  xxxg382xxx  antigens on the surface of the cells occurs.
previous studies19,24 as well as our present data show that “empty”
 xxxg382xxx  antigens (not bound to  xxxd2190xxx ) can be detected on
leukemic blast cells 3 to 14 days after infusion of a (radionuclideor drug-conjugated)  xxxg382xxx  antibody. however, these expression
data mainly reflect the disappearance of the  xxxg382xxx  antibody from
the circulation and thus the decrease in saturation levels, but these
studies do not demonstrate ongoing (new) expression of  xxxg382xxx 

targeting of  xxxd2190xxx  to aml blast cells

antigens during  xxxg382xxx  antibody therapy. our data strongly suggest
that new  xxxg382xxx  antigenic sites are continuously being expressed on
the surface of the cells, although pulse-labeling studies with
35s-methionine may be necessary to strengthen this conclusion.
our combined results suggest that the binding of  xxxd2190xxx  to
the  xxxg382xxx  antigen, the subsequent internalization, and the expression of new  xxxg382xxx  molecules form an ongoing process, which
probably contributes to a progressive accumulation of the drug.
therefore, we hypothesize that infusion of higher doses of  xxxd2190xxx  might result in prolonged saturation and subsequent internalization levels, thereby resulting in higher levels of drug targeted to the
leukemic cells and possibly better treatment results. it has been
shown that supersaturating doses of the  xxxg382xxx  antibody m195 (36
mg/m2 daily for 4 days) are well tolerated and show antileukemic
activity.25 alternatively it may be possible to use more frequent
 xxxd2190xxx  cycles to obtain prolonged saturating serum levels and
thereby exploit the renewed  xxxg382xxx  antigen expression for more
efficient drug targeting.
calicheamicin  xxxd3249xxx , resulting in double-strand breaks
and the induction of apoptosis.9,10 we now demonstrate that
calicheamicin, conjugated to a  xxxg382xxx  antibody, is able to induce
apoptosis in vitro in  xxxg382xxx -expressing cells but is unable to induce
apoptosis in  xxxg382xxx ⫺ cells (ie, lymphocytes). these data are in
accordance with a recent report showing the cytocidal effect of
 xxxd2190xxx  on  xxxg382xxx ⫹ leukemic cell lines.26 in our study, the induction of
apoptosis was apparent after 72 to 96 hours of culturing the cells in
the presence of  xxxd2190xxx . in accordance with these in vitro data, no
apoptosis was observed in blood samples obtained within the first 6
hours after the start of  xxxd2190xxx  treatment. although several
mechanisms may contribute to the removal or killing of leukemic
cells (eg, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity),26,27 our in vitro data show that the
antileukemic effect of  xxxd2190xxx  is at least partly based on the
induction of apoptosis in  xxxg382xxx -expressing cells.
data from the  xxxd2190xxx  phase ii studies indicate that  xxxd2190xxx 
induces remission in 31% of the patients.28 it is not clear why only a
subset of patients can be induced into complete remission. data
from the phase i study show that drug efflux may play a role.11 it
may, however, be expected that the clinical response is in part
dependent on the level of saturation or internalization or both. in
our results for the 122 relapsed aml patients, the minimal level of
saturation on blast cells was 72%, whereas internalization varied
between 15% and 69% (6-hour time point). nevertheless, we did
not find a difference in the percentages saturation and internalization between patients who showed less than 5% blast cells in the pb
prior to the start of the second treatment cycle and patients with still
5% or more blasts in their pb. clearly, it will be of interest to
correlate our saturation and internalization data with clinical
outcome. these data are not yet fully available.
in conclusion,  xxxd2190xxx  rapidly binds to  xxxg382xxx -expressing
leukemic and normal cells, after which internalization occurs and
apoptosis is induced. these data provide insight into the mechanism of action of  xxxd2190xxx  and support the use of antibody-targeted
chemotherapy in patients with aml. current protocols are investigating the applicability of  xxxd2190xxx  therapy in patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome and the applicability of combined
 xxxd2190xxx  therapy and “classical” chemotherapy in aml patients.
