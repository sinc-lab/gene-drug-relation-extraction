comparison of ligand binding affinities at human i1-imidazoline binding sites and the high affinity state of alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtypes.  to identify selective compounds for nonadrenergic i1-imidazoline receptors (i1), the affinities of 22 ligands for [125i]p-iodoclonidine binding have been compared at human platelet i1-imidazoline binding sites (analyzed under norepinephrine mask of alpha-2 ar) and at human alpha-2a, alpha-2b and alpha-2c adrenoceptors stably expressed on transfected chinese hamster ovary cells. competition curves at the platelet i1-imidazoline binding site were biphasic for most compounds. only tizanidine and bdf,6143 displayed monophasic i1 competition curves.  xxxd94xxx , an endogenous neurotransmitter candidate for the i1-imidazoline receptor, was identified as the most selective agent for a subcomponent of platelet i1 sites. the affinity of  xxxd94xxx  at the high affinity component of platelet i1 sites was 1400-fold selective over alpha-2a adrenoceptors, 5000-fold selective over alpha-2b adrenoceptors and 800-fold selective over alpha-2c adrenoceptors.  xxxd2674xxx  and tizanidine also displayed selectivities for a high affinity component of the platelet i1 binding sites over alpha-2 adrenoceptors.  xxxd2698xxx  was the most selective compound for the high affinity state of the  xxxg88xxx , displaying 7-, 23- and 9-fold higher affinity than alpha-2b, alpha-2c and platelet i1-midazoline binding sites, respectively. no single selective compound was identified for the  xxxg89xxx . norepinephrine displayed, respectively, 18- and 31-fold selectivity for the high affinity state of the  xxxg90xxx  as compared to alpha-2a- or alpha-2b adrenoceptors, and was > 100,000- fold selective over platelet i1-imidazoline sites. thus, human alpha-2 adrenoceptors and the platelet i1-imidazoline binding site can be clearly discriminated based on their affinities for certain compounds.
