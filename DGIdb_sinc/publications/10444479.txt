factor-␣ secretion in hypertensive and heart failure-prone
rats. am. j. physiol. 277 (heart circ. physiol. 46): h543–
h550, 1999.—acute increases in blood pressure (bp) increase
myocardial  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-␣ production, but it is
not known whether chronic hypertensive stress elevates
myocardial tnf-␣ production, possibly contributing to cardiac remodeling, decreased cardiac function, and faster progression to heart failure. bp, cardiac function, and size were
evaluated in normotensive [sprague-dawley (sd)], spontaneously hypertensive (shr), and spontaneously hypertensive
heart failure-prone (shhf) rats at 6, 12, 15, and 18 mo of age
and in failing shhf. left ventricular tissues were evaluated
for secretion of bioactive tnf-␣ and inhibition of tnf-␣
secretion by phosphodiesterase inhibitors. all ventricles secreted bioactive and immunoreactive tnf-␣, but secretion
decreased with age. shr and shhf rats secreted more
tnf-␣ than sd rats at 6 mo of age, but only failing shhf
rats secreted significantly more tnf-␣ at 18 mo.  xxxd2341xxx 
inhibited tnf-␣ secretion in all rats and was less potent but
more efficacious than ro-201724 in all strains. tnf-␣ secretion correlated with bp and left ventricular mass in 6-mo-old
rats, but this relationship disappeared with age. results
suggest that hypertension and/or cardiac remodeling is associated with elevated myocardial tnf-␣, and, although hypertension, per se, did not maintain elevated cardiac tnf-␣
levels, shhf rats increase tnf-␣ production during the end
stages of failure.

emphasis in congestive heart failure (chf) research
has shifted toward the development of pharmacological
tools that prevent or delay the onset of later stages of
chf (11). this emphasis necessitates the identification
of physiologically relevant mediators of progressive
deterioration of cardiac function and the use of appropriate models to study their pathological effects. one
potential mediator of chf that has gained attention is
 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-␣; its presence and function in heart failure has been suggested by many
investigators (3, 14, 25, 30, 35, 41). tnf-␣ is a physiologically important depressant of cardiac function
during septic shock (33), and studies in humans demonstrate that plasma tnf-␣ is elevated in chf patients

to concentrations that can produce left ventricular
dysfunction, pulmonary edema, and uncoupling of ␤-adrenergic receptors (25, 30, 34). in addition, tnf-␣ is a
hypertrophic stimulus for cultured cardiac myocytes
and alters collagen and collagenase activity and expression in numerous cell types (2, 7, 12, 13). we and others
have demonstrated that the myocardium expresses and
secretes bioactive tnf-␣ (6, 18, 34, 42). therefore, we
hypothesized that cardiac cells produce tnf-␣ that
acts in an autocrine fashion, contributing to the pathobiology (i.e., decreased cardiac contractility, altered
matrix production) of chf before appreciable increases
in plasma tnf-␣ levels occur. recent reports (23)
demonstrate robust increases in tnf-␣ mrna expression and bioactive protein production after 3 h of aortic
banding (i.e., hypertensive stress). we hypothesized
that if tnf-␣ contributes to cardiac remodeling and
chf, then genetically hypertensive rats prone to developing chf would have greater myocardial production
of tnf-␣ compared with normotensive rats or spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr), which do not routinely
succumb to failure. to attain these goals, 6-, 12-, and
18-mo-old drug-naive rats of sprague-dawley (sd),
shr, and spontaneously hypertensive heart failureprone/mcc-facp (shhf) strains were used. also, shhf
rats in terminal heart failure were studied.
because it may be clinically beneficial to inhibit
cardiac production of tnf-␣, we determined whether
tnf-␣ production could be modulated using  xxxd2341xxx 
and ro-201724, type iii and  xxxg1700xxx  (pde) inhibitors, respectively. both type iii and iv
pde inhibitors block tnf-␣ gene transcription and,
consequently, tnf-␣ protein production (17, 31, 37),
and it is hypothesized that inhibition of myocardial
production of tnf-␣ by pde inhibitors may prove to be
a useful way to study the detrimental effects of tnf-␣
on myocardial remodeling and progression of chf.
 xxxd2341xxx  and ro-201724 were chosen to determine
whether there was a differential ability of pde inhibitors to block tnf-␣ release with respect to age or
extent of cardiac remodeling.
methods

experimental animals
the animals used were male sd, shr, and shhf rats.
shhf rats were from the shhf/mcc-facp rat colony maintained by dr. sylvia mccune at the ohio state university
(osu; columbus, oh). shhf rats originated from a mating
between the koletsky rat (an sd derivative) and an inbred
shr from the okamoto strain (28, 29). long-standing hypertension elicits cardiac hypertrophy and progressive fibrosis.

myocardial tnf-␣

plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, and renin
activity gradually increase as the animals age, indicating a
stage of compensatory left ventricular dysfunction (22). shhf
rats can die of chf as early as 15 mo of age, but most
routinely succumb between 17 and 20 mo. animals in decompensated chf typically present with cachexia, subcutaneous
edema, dyspnea, cyanosis, and malaise (29). left ventricular
function during overt heart failure, as measured by the first
derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dt), is markedly
reduced, and cardiac myocytes are hypertrophied and elongated (16). sd and shr were obtained from harlan (indianapolis, in) at 5–9 mo of age and maintained in the osu
animal facility until they were of appropriate age for experimentation. the animals were allowed food and water ad
libitum, and all procedures were approved by the osu animal
care committee. this investigation conforms with the guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the
national institutes of health [dhhs publication no. (nih)
85–23, revised 1985].
the initial study was designed to monitor blood pressure
and cardiac function and then, after rats were killed at 6, 12,
and 18 mo of age (n ⫽ 6 per age per strain), to measure cardiac
size, tnf-␣ secretion, and pde inhibition of tnf-␣ secretion
in vitro. these ages were chosen because rats become stably
hypertensive by 6 mo of age. by 12 mo of age, shr and shhf
rats have been chronically hypertensive, and shhf rats have
increased neurohumoral factors, such as elevated plasma
renin activity, atrial natriuretic factor, and sympathetic nervous system activity. the final time point of 18 mo was chosen
as a time immediately before natural onset of end-stage
failure. before completion of the initial study, two shhf rats
that had been assigned to the 18-mo group exhibited signs of
terminal chf. on analysis of tnf-␣ secretion, it appeared
that failing rats had markedly different levels of tnf-␣
secretion compared with age-matched animals not in failure,
and a second study was conducted to increase the data
collected from rats in failure (therefore, n ⫽ 6 failing shhf
rats). in the second study 7-mo-old shhf (n ⫽ 5) and failing
shhf (n ⫽ 4) rats were also evaluated for immunologically
detectable tnf-␣ secreted into conditioned medium, in vitro,
and for left ventricular tnf-␣ content.
blood pressure and echocardiographic measurements
systolic blood pressure (sbp) was measured using an iitc
tail-cuff pump (woodland hills, ca) attached to a gilson
duograph (gilson medical electronics, middletown, wi) immediately after light anesthesia with intraperitoneal ketamine-xylazine (10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively). echocardiograms were then obtained by performing two-dimensional
and m-mode echocardiography using a color phased-array
doppler system (model sonos 1000, hewlett-packard,
waltham, ma) with a dual frequency (7.5 mhz image/5.0
mhz doppler) transducer as previously described (19). left
ventricular posterior (i.e., free wall) thickness (pwt), enddiastolic diameter (edd), and end-systolic diameter (esd)
were derived from m-mode echocardiograms using the leading edge method. fractional shortening was calculated as
(edd ⫺ esd)/edd ⫻ 100%. relative wall thickness was
calculated as (2 ⫻ pwt)/edd. in the 6-mo, 12-mo, 18-mo, and
failing groups, sbp and echocardiograms were performed
3–5 days before death. the rats that were designated for
death at 18 mo of age also had serial blood pressure and
echocardiographic measurements performed at 12 and 15 mo
of age. because there were no significant differences in
measurements taken at 12 mo of age from those in rats
designated for death at 12 or 18 mo of age, all 12-mo data
were combined (n ⫽ 12/strain at 12 mo).

left ventricle tissue preparation
rats were weighed and killed between 9:00 am and 12:00
pm. rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100
mg/kg ip), 6–8 ml of blood were collected via cardiac puncture
for subsequent measurement of circulating tnf-␣, and the
heart was removed and perfused through a cannulated aorta
with 50 ml of sterile 50% dmem plus 50% f-12 medium,
supplemented with 2.45 g/l sodium bicarbonate and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin. the heart was weighed; the right
atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle plus
septum were dissected and weighed; and sections were frozen
at ⫺80°c. the lower one-third of the left ventricle was minced
with a razor blade into 1 ⫻ 1-mm sections and rinsed
thoroughly with dmem to remove any remaining blood
components. the minced left ventricle was then weighed and
divided into 12 pieces of approximately equal weight and
incubated for 4 h at 37°c in a gassed incubator (5% co2-95%
air) in 2 ml of dmem-5% fetal bovine serum (fbs)-1%
penicillin-streptomycin (df5). the incubation media were
collected under sterile conditions and frozen at ⫺80°c before
evaluation for tnf-␣ quantity. the minced myocardium was
also frozen at ⫺80°c and then weighed before subsequent
measurement of protein and dna content using the methods
of lowry (26) and burton (9), respectively.
drugs
left ventricular tissues were incubated with five concentrations of  xxxd2341xxx  (obtained from the hospital pharmacy as
the injectable lactate salt diluted to appropriate experimental
concentrations with df5 medium) and with five concentrations of ro-201724 [obtained from rbi, natick, ma; dissolved in 4.5% (wt/vol) aqueous 2-hydroxypropyl-␤-cyclodextrin and diluted to appropriate experimental concentrations
with df5 medium].
tnf-␣ determination
bioactive tnf-␣. cytotoxicity assay was performed as
previously described by matthews and neale (27). briefly,
l929 cells were grown in rpmi medium with 5% fbs and
antibiotics in 96-well culture plates. the cells were allowed to
incubate at 37°c overnight. the next day,  xxxd1800xxx  (1
µg/ml) was added to the wells, and conditioned medium (200
µl/well) or heat-treated serum [30 µl/well; previously heated
to 56°c for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature (21)]
were applied. after another overnight incubation, the medium and serum were decanted from the cells, and the cells
were fixed with 5% formaldehyde in pbs for 5 min and then
stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 5 min. after the cells were
washed and dried, the extent of cytotoxicity was determined
using an slc spectra plate reader by measuring the absorbance at 580 nm after cells were solubilized in 150 µl of 33%
glacial acetic acid. the limit of detection of the cytotoxicity
assay was ⬃1 pg/ml with the use of recombinant mouse
tnf-␣ as standard (3 ⫻ 108 u/mg; gibco). we have previously demonstrated that 80–90% of bioactivity detected by
this method is neutralized using tnf-␣-selective antibodies
and that bioactivity approximates tnf-␣ release from isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes and is not produced by adherent inflammatory cells (6).
immunoreactive tnf-␣. immunoreactive tnf-␣ was measured in heparinized plasma from all rats using the factor
test x elisa (genzyme diagnostics, cambridge, ma), which
has a limit of detection of 10 pg/ml. immunoreactive tnf-␣
was detected in conditioned medium and cardiac tissue using
the cytoscreen ultrasensitive rat tnf-␣ elisa (biosource
international, camarillo, ca), which has a detection limit of

⬍0.7 pg/ml. tnf-␣ tissue content was analyzed after rapid
homogenization of 50–100 mg of left ventricular tissue in 1.5
ml of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in pbs. the
homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 9,000 g, and then
the supernatant fraction was subjected to elisa.
statistical analysis
statistical differences among groups were evaluated using
two-factor anova followed by newman-keuls post hoc multiple-comparison tests using the number crunchers statistical system (ncss; jerry hintze, kaysville, ut). ic50 values
were calculated from dose-response curves obtained from
individual rats, utilizing the graph pad statistical package.
correlation coefficients were determined using least-squares
multiple regression analysis. the significance level was set at
p ⬍ 0.05. all results are expressed as means ⫾ se.
results

with the exception of data for the rats assigned to the
failing shhf group, all data included in tables 1 and 2
and in fig. 1 were obtained from rats free of signs of
chf. one animal was omitted from analysis in each of
the 12-mo-old shr, 18-mo-old shr, and 18-mo-old sd
groups because of evidence of apical infarction or death
due to unknown causes; therefore, n ⫽ 5 in these age
groups. in the 18-mo-old shhf group, only four animals survived to the designated time of death without

blood pressure and cardiac function parameters

left ventricular tnf-␣ secretion

sbp did not change with age in sd rats and was
significantly elevated in shr and shhf rats compared
with sd rats at all ages (table 1). blood pressure was
significantly higher in shhf rats compared with shr
at 12 mo of age but was significantly decreased at 18 mo
of age in shhf rats. pwt was greater in shhf rats at
12 mo of age and in all hypertensive rats by 15 mo of
age. edd in sd rats tended to be larger than in
age-matched shr, except at 18 mo of age. this may be
a reflection of significantly greater body weights in sd
rats (see table 2). edd in shr remained constant until
rats reached 18 mo of age, when dilatation of the
chamber appears to occur. shhf rats, which initially
had larger body weights than shr, had larger edd at
6 mo of age. because body weights of shr and shhf
rats equalized with age, edd in shhf rats was similar
to that in shr. however, there was no dilatation of the
left ventricle in 18-mo-old shhf animals that showed
no signs of chf. all animals in the failure group
showed markedly dilated chamber diameters. calculation of relative wall thickness revealed that shr and
shhf rats 12 mo of age and older had thicker wall-tolumen ratios than sd rats, indicative of concentric
hypertrophy. shhf rats with signs of chf had lower
relative wall thickness, indicative of eccentric hypertrophy or fluid overload in the failing shhf rats. fractional shortening did not change with age in sd rats.
fractional shortening was greater in shr and shhf
rats compared with that in sd rats at 6 mo of age, and
fractional shortening in shr and shhf rats tended to
decrease by 18 mo of age, but these values were not
significant. however, all animals with heart failure
showed compromised fractional shortening.

the left ventricle taken from 6-mo-old shr and
shhf rats secreted approximately twofold the amount
of tnf-␣ secreted from 6-mo-old normotensive controls
(fig. 1). at 12 mo of age, the amount of tnf-␣ secreted
from the left ventricle of sd rats had not changed from
the amount secreted from 6-mo-old sd rats. however,
shr and shhf rats secreted significantly less tnf-␣
at 12 mo of age than at 6 mo of age, and neither
hypertensive group secreted amounts different from
that of 12-mo-old sd rats. at 18 mo of age, the amounts
of tnf-␣ secreted from the left ventricle of sd, shr,
and shhf rats not showing signs of chf were significantly less than the amounts secreted from 6-mo-old
rats from respective strains. eighteen-month-old shhf
rats with no overt signs of heart failure tended to
secrete more tnf-␣ than age-matched shr and sd
rats, although this was not statistically significant.
however, shhf rats documented to be in chf by
clinical signs and echocardiography averaged tnf-␣
secretion that was threefold higher than that of 18-moold sd rats and shr. these differences were also
observed when tnf-␣ secretion was normalized to
milligrams of protein or micrograms of dna (data not
shown).
because the bioactivity assay for tnf-␣ can be
affected by the presence of soluble receptors and because tnf-␣ secretion may not accurately reflect tnf-␣
tissue content, it is important to compare bioactivity
measurements with immunodetectable tnf-␣ secreted
into medium and present in left ventricular tissue.
therefore, elisas and cytotoxicity experiments were
performed on additional samples collected from five
7-mo-old and four failing shhf rats (ef ⬍ 30%). as
shown in fig. 2, secreted tnf-␣ measured by bioassay
was comparable to secreted tnf-␣ measured by elisa

body weight and cardiac weights
at 6 mo of age, body weights for shhf rats were
intermediate between those for sd rats and shr,
perhaps a reflection of the shhf rats being a cross
between sd rats and shr. however, after the age of 12
mo, shhf rat and shr body weights were similar, and
both were less than those of age-matched sd rats
(table 2). in general, absolute weights and weight-tobody weight ratios for the heart, left ventricle, and
right ventricle were greater in all hypertensive animals
by 12 mo of age (table 2). all cardiac weight parameters
were increased in animals with failure, with marked
increases in heart weight index and right ventricle
index.
circulating tnf-␣
bioactive tnf-␣ in serum, as determined by cytotoxicity assay, was below the level of detection in all ages of
all three strains of rats. immunoactive tnf-␣, as
determined by elisa, was above the detection limit in
only one or two rats per age group per strain with the

correlation analysis

to determine whether a relationship existed between
1) ambient blood pressure and tnf-␣ release from the
left ventricle, 2) left ventricular size and tnf-␣ release
from the left ventricle, and 3) fractional shortening and
tnf-␣ release, correlation analysis was performed
using each of these parameters for all rats. global
regression analysis revealed no correlation among these
parameters. however, subgroup analysis, performed
for groups classified by age or rat strain, revealed
several significant correlations. at 6 mo of age, blood
pressure was linearly correlated with tnf-␣ secretion
(r ⫽ 0.68, p ⬍ 0.01). at 12 and 18 mo of age, this
relationship did not exist. at 6 mo of age, there was a
highly significant linear correlation between an increase in left ventricular size and tnf-␣ secretion (r ⫽
0.757, p ⬍ 0.001) (fig. 3) that, like the correlation seen
with blood pressure, disappeared with age. there were
no significant correlations between fractional shortening and the secretion of tnf-␣ from the left ventricle.
inhibition of tnf-␣ secretion by pde inhibitors
 xxxd2341xxx  exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of
tnf-␣ secretion from the left ventricle in all groups of
rats. the maximal effect of  xxxd2341xxx  ranged from 80 to
100% inhibition of tnf-␣ secretion and did not differ
among the rat strains or ages. also, the potency of
 xxxd2341xxx  (determined by its ic50 ) did not differ with
respect to age or strain (table 3). we have shown
previously (6) that type iv pde inhibitors such as
ro-201724 have similar efficacy but are more potent
than  xxxd2341xxx  in inhibiting tnf-␣ secretion in 3-moold sd rats. in this study, in 6-mo-old sd rats, the
efficacy of ro-201724 was similar to that of  xxxd2341xxx 
(⬃80% inhibition of tnf-␣ release) and was more
potent (table 4), consistent with the findings in youn-

than  xxxd2341xxx  in all other age groups of sd and shhf
rats, the maximal inhibitory effect of ro-2011724 was less
than that observed for  xxxd2341xxx ; ro-201724 inhibition of
tnf-␣ secretion ranged from 44 to 68% for older sd and
shhf rats. most striking was the relative lack of effect of
ro-201724 in shr, in which inhibition of tnf-␣ secretion
ranged from 30 to 50%. ic50 values for ro-201724 were
not calculated for shr because of this marginal effect.
discussion

because tnf-␣ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure, it was the goal of these studies to
investigate whether tnf-␣ secretion was altered 1)
due to chronic hypertension and 2) during the process
of cardiac remodeling and eventual progression to
heart failure. although there are many causative factors of heart failure (8), we chose a rat genetic model of
heart failure, the shhf/mcc-facp rat, which demonstrates a natural progression from cardiac hypertrophy
(due to hypertension), to a stage of compensated left
ventricular dysfunction (characterized by increased
circulating factors such as atrial natriuretic peptide,
plasma renin activity, and aldosterone), to overt decompensated heart failure (characterized by cachexia, fluid
accumulation, dyspnea, and decreased dp/dt). shr
were used as a control for the effect of hypertension on
tnf-␣ production and to delineate whether myocardial
tnf-␣ secretion could be used as an indicator of which
hypertensive animals were destined to succumb to
heart failure. cardiac function and dimensions of the
rats used in this study were similar to those reported

myocardial tnf-␣

previously for sd, shr, and shhf rats, suggesting
consistency within these strains studied over time.
two important points can be made with respect to
tnf-␣ production in relation to hypertension and
cardiac size/remodeling. first, the initial stage of cardiac remodeling in response to elevated blood pressure
is coincident with increased tnf-␣ secretion from the
left ventricle in both shr and shhf rats. shr and
shhf rats become stably hypertensive by 3–4 mo of
age. during this relatively early presence of stable
hypertension and/or cardiac hypertrophy, tnf-␣ expression/release appears to be increased. kapadia et al. (23)
report that there is a biophysical link between 30 min of
hemodynamic overloading and the production of tnf-␣
in feline myocardium and that exposure to hypertensive stress for ⱕ180 min results in even greater cardiac
expression of tnf-␣. although we observed a stronger
correlation between left ventricular size and tnf-␣
than between sbp and tnf-␣, others have shown no
change in tnf-␣ expression in hypertrophied right
ventricular tissue induced by hypobaric hypoxia (24);
this may suggest that elevated blood pressure increases tnf-␣, which may play a role in cardiac
remodeling. indeed, tnf-␣ has been shown to alter
collagenase, collagens, and fibronectin expression in
various cell types (2, 7, 12, 13). an alteration in cardiac
matrix breakdown and production may therefore assist
in cardiac remodeling. however, if hypertension is an
important stimulus for tnf-␣ secretion during its
early stages, there appears to be a loss of this regulation during prolonged hypertension.
second, there is a general decline in bioactive tnf-␣
release from the left ventricle with age, independent of
strain or blood pressure; however, older shhf rats and
shhf rats in overt chf retain or reacquire the ability
to synthesize tnf-␣, and this may be important in
cardiac remodeling occurring later during the disease
process. few studies investigating the effect of rat age
on tnf-␣ secretion have been reported (4, 15). serum
levels of tnf-␣ were low or nondetectable in young
(3–5 mo) and old (2 yr) fischer 344 rats, and there were
no significant changes with age (15). interestingly, we
found that only young shr had measurable plasma
tnf-␣ levels. also, organoid cultures of aorta from old
rats (30 mo) were capable of secreting tnf-␣, whereas
aorta from 10-mo-old rats were not (4). with respect to
cardiac tnf-␣, our previous evidence (6) suggests that
cardiac myocytes are capable of secreting tnf-␣. therefore, the normal loss of viable cardiac muscle cells with
age (1) may account for the observation that there is a
decrease in tnf-␣ release from the left ventricle with
age, and this may be particularly relevant in hypertensive animals, which demonstrate cardiac hypertrophy
and, presumably, increased fibrosis and cardiac myocyte death (40). alternatively, during cardiac decompensation, there may be an increase in receptor shedding,
an elaboration of neurohormones that may alter camp,
and/or production of counterregulatory cytokines, such
as  xxxg1161xxx , which may contribute to the decreased tnf-␣ production with age.

because we have previously shown that both type iii
and iv pde isozyme inhibitors inhibit tnf-␣ release
from young sd rat heart, we were interested in determining whether the control of tnf-␣ secretion by pde
inhibitors changes with age or disease state. previous
studies have shown no difference between ic50 values
for  xxxd2341xxx  inhibition of camp production in aortic
smooth muscle from wistar-kyoto rats and shr of
unreported age (38). also, the percent inhibition of
cardiac particulate and soluble type iii pde produced
by 1 µm milrinone was not different between shamoperated rats and rats subjected to myocardial infarction, suggesting that hypertension or the presence of
heart failure, per se, does not necessarily alter the
overall ability of type iii inhibitors to increase intracellular camp. however, smith et al. (39) have shown a
decrease in the expression of cardiac type iii pdes in a
dog model of heart failure, and the effectiveness of
milrinone to alter papillary muscle contractility was
markedly decreased in 18-mo-old versus 2-mo-old rats
(10), suggesting that age or the etiology of heart failure
may alter the effectiveness of pde inhibitors on cardiac
tnf-␣ secretion. in this study, the ic50 values for
 xxxd2341xxx  and ro-201724 in 6-mo-old sd rats were
similar to those reported by our laboratory for 3-mo-old
sd rats (6), and the ic50 for  xxxd2341xxx  approximates the
ec50 required to increase cardiac index in humans (20
µm) (5). there were no significant effects of age on
either type iii or type iv pde ic50 values, and prolonged hypertension, cardiac remodeling, or overt chf
did not alter the potency or efficacy of the type iii pde
inhibitor. a consistently different profile was observed
for type iv pde inhibition, in which the presence of
hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy variably
decreased efficacy without having marked effects on
potency. the relative lack of effect in shr was particularly striking, and further characterization of the pde
isoforms present in cardiac tissue, at both the molecular expression and protein content levels, is warranted.
the mechanism of action of pde inhibitors to inhibit
secretion of tnf-␣ is thought to be mediated via
alterations in intracellular camp (36). the contribution of pde iii and iv to camp turnover may differ
with strain or disease state, or a compartmental shift
may occur in the camp pool, pde, or camp-dependent
protein kinases, allowing for differential effectiveness
of pde inhibitors. another possibility exists in that
inhibition of tnf-␣ secretion by pde inhibitors may
not be wholly dependent on changes in camp levels (as
demonstrated for other classes of tnf-␣-inhibiting
drugs) and that an additional mechanism of action
explains this difference in potency. further studies are
necessary to delineate the mechanism(s) by which pde
inhibitors inhibit cardiac tnf-␣ secretion.
because tnf-␣ is secreted in equal amounts from
cardiac tissue from both shr and shhf rats at 6 and
12 mo of age, early expression of tnf-␣ in the myocardium may not serve as a marker to determine which
subjects will demonstrate progression of chf. however, in a rodent model of chf, cardiac tnf-␣ secretion
is greater during florid failure than in age-matched

myocardial tnf-␣

controls. it is known that shhf rats are desensitized
to the effects of ␤-adrenergic agonists (20), which may
result in decreased intramyocyte camp concentration
and withdrawal of camp-mediated tnf-␣ suppression
at later ages. local production of tnf-␣ may contribute
early (i.e., 6 mo of age) to cardiac remodeling and later
(i.e., 18 mo of age) to cardiac dysfunction, although
cardiac production does not contribute to measurable
levels of tnf-␣ in the plasma of shhf rats of either
age. the physiological source of plasma tnf-␣ in
6-mo-old shr requires further investigation. studies
should be done examining myocardial tnf-␣ receptor
changes with age as well as possible differences in
tnf-␣ biological effect with respect to age and rat
strain, particularly because of the fact that older rats
(15 mo) have diminished metabolic responses to exogenous tnf-␣ (32).
