abstract
the limited entry of interleukin-1b (il-1b) into the central nervous system has led to the hypothesis
that il-1b acts, through il-1b receptors located notably on endothelial cells, on the release of
prostaglandins which in turn stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis. we used  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) and  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) inhibitors, before
the injection of il-1b, to explore the role of  xxxd208xxx  metabolic pathways on hpa axis
activation. adult male rats were i.m injected 20 min before i.p injection of il-1b, with (i): a
cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor ( xxxd2423xxx ); (ii) a cox-2 selective inhibitor (ns 398); or (iii) a  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor
(bw a4c). following this, rats were killed 90 min after i.p. il-1b injection and analysis for plasma
 xxxg1801xxx  (acth) and corticosterone concentrations and determination of
anterior pituitary pro-opio melanocortin (pomc) gene transcription was conducted. administration of
the cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor led to a complete blockage of acth and corticosterone secretion and
pomc gene transcription. the cox-2 inhibitor led to a complete blockade of acth secretion and
pomc gene transcription but had no effect on corticosterone secretion. the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor had no
significant effect on any parameter. these results demonstrate the crucial role of eicosanoid
pathways in mediating the stimulation of the hpa axis induced by il-1b. moreover, we found a clear
dissociation of the effect of the blockage of coxs upon acth and corticosterone secretion,
suggesting that il-1b may act at the brain as well as at the adrenal cortex to stimulate the secretion
of corticosterone.

interleukin 1b (il-1b) is a polypeptide secreted by activated
macrophage, and is involved in mediating communication
between the immune and the neuroendocrine systems. il-1b
stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis,
resulting in the release of  xxxg1801xxx 
(acth ) and corticosterone (1–3). this activation does not
seem to be due to a direct action of il-1b at the pituitary
gland (4, 5), but through an activation of the hypothalamic
 xxxg517xxx  (crh ) release and synthesis.
consistent with this hypothesis, il-1b-induced acth release
is blocked by passive crh immunoneutralization (6), and

il-1b induces an increase in crh release into hypophysial
portal blood (2) and a decrease in immunoreactive crh in
the median eminence (3).
the limited entry of il-1b into the central nervous system
(cns) (7, 8) has led to the hypothesis that il-1b stimulates
the hpa axis via the production of intermediates, which in
turn act on the hypothalamus. in particular, circulating  xxxg1170xxx  might act at receptors on endothelial cells to activate the
synthesis and release of prostaglandins. in accordance to this
theory, it has been demonstrated that the brain concentrations
of prostaglandins are raised during central physiological

cox-1, cox-2 and  xxxg147xxx  and activation of the hpa axis 767
diseases (9) and during inflammation (10). moreover prostaglandins can stimulate acth production in vivo (11, 12),
and crh hypothalamic release in vitro (13). in addition, in
vivo studies have demonstrated that indomethacin, a non
specific cyclo-oxygenases 1 and 2 (cox-1 and cox-2) activity inhibitor, could totally or partially inhibit the rise in
acth secretion induced by peripheral or intracerebral  xxxg1170xxx  administration (14). however, it has been suggested (15)
that this inhibitory effect of indomethacin is mediated principally by a fast rate-sensitive feedback effect of corticosterone,
the secretion of which is stimulated directly by indomethacin.
nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that in adrenalectomized and corticosteroid-treated rats, the acth production
induced by il-1b may partially depend on the release of
prostaglandins (15). moreover, in vitro studies using incubated hypothalami, confirm the ability of il-1b to induce
prostaglandin (pge ) and crh secretion, that could be
2
blocked by indomethacin (16). the brain itself may be a
source of prostaglandins in response to peripheral injection
of cytokine. concentrations of pge in the organum vasculo2
sum laminae terminalis (ovlt ), medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus (pvn ), dorsal hippocampus, and
cerebrospinal fluid are all increased within 20 min of i.v.
injection of il-1b (17). moreover, all of these neuronal
structures contain both cox-1 and cox-2 immunoreactivity
(18, 19).
the aim of the present work was to explore the role of
 xxxd208xxx  metabolic pathways in the activation of the
hpa axis induced by il-1b. for this purpose, nonspecific
cox-1/cox-2 activity inhibitor ( xxxd2423xxx ), a specific
cox-2 activity inhibitor (ns 398) and a  xxxg147xxx 
( xxxg147xxx  ) activity inhibitor (bw a4c ) were administered
before activating the hpa axis by il-1b. changes in the
secretion of acth and corticosterone were correlated with
the rate of anterior pituitary pro-opio melanocortin (pomc )
gene transcription. a highly sensitive solution hybridization
nuclease protection assay (5, 20) was used to quantify the
pomc nuclear primary transcript level in the anterior pituitary. as the half-life of the primary transcript is very short,
its level correlates closely to the rate of pomc gene transcription as has been demonstrated for the pomc gene in the
pituitary by nuclear transcription run-on assays (21).

materials and methods
animals
wistar male rats (70±7 days; 250±25 g), charles river strain ( france) were
housed under controlled temperature and light conditions (23±1 °c; light on
from 07.00 h to 19.00 h) with food and water ad libitum. rats were acclimatized
to the laboratory environment for 2 weeks.
in vivo experimental procedures
on the day of the experiment, rats were injected i.m. with  xxxd2423xxx 
(5 mg/kg, a non selective cox-1/cox-2 activity inhibitor); or with ns 398
(5 mg/kg, a selective cox-2 activity inhibitor); or with bw a4c (5 mg/kg a
selective  xxxg147xxx  activity inhibitor) 20 min before an i.p. injection of il-1b
(4 mg/kg). following this, seven rats from each vehicle or treated groups were
killed by decapitation 90 min after injection. the time 0 control rats were
killed without injection.

blood collection
blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta) tubes and
centrifuged (1000 g, 10 min, 4 °c ). plasma was aliquoted and rapidly frozen
at −20 °c and stored until hormonal assays were performed.
anterior pituitary sampling
the anterior pituitary was rapidly removed and frozen at −80 °c until
homogenization.
plasma acth assay
acth was measured by a specific radio-immunoassay ( icn biomedicals inc.
kit). the acth antiserum does not crossreact with b-endorphin, melanocytestimulaying hormone, lipotropin. the detection limit of the assay was
approximately 10 pg/ml. the intra-and interassay variation coefficients were
5 and 8%, respectively. acth was measured using 100 ml of plasma edta
samples.
plasma corticosterone assay
plasma samples (50 ml ) were extracted with ethanol and then assayed by a
radio-competition method. the rabbit polyclonal corticosterone antiserum
was a generous gift from dr c. oliver (inserm, marseille, france), and
corticosterone (sigma, st loius, mo, usa) as standard. the detection limit
was 5 ng/ml and the intra-and interassay coefficients of variation were 3%
and 4%, respectively.
rna preparation
rna was isolated and quantified by previously published methods (5, 20).
anterior pituitaries were independently homogenized, in 500 ml of ice cold
buffer (10 m tris ph 8, 3 m  xxxg2125xxx  , 2 m mgcl , 2 m dithiothreitol, 40 u
2
2
rnasin (promega; madison, wi, usa), 0.3  sucrose, 0.15% triton x100).
the homogenate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing 300 ml
of ice-cold cushion buffer (0.4  sucrose). nuclei were separated from the
cytoplasmic extract by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min.
to isolate anterior pituitary nuclear rna, the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 300 ml dnaase buffer(100 m tris ph 8, 10 m nacl, 2 m
mgcl , 2 m dtt, 40 u rnasin) and digested with 40 u rnaase-free
2
dnaase ( worthington; freehold, nj, usa) for 5 min at 37 °c. one-tenth
volume of 10×set and proteinase k adjusted to a final concentration of
100 mg/ml, were added and the samples were incubated at 45 °c for 30 min.
nuclear rna was subsequently extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. nuclear rna extracted from each ap was reconstituted
in 10 ml 1×te and 5 ml aliquot (equivalent to half of an anterior pituitary)
was used to quantify pomc nuclear rna.
solution hybridization/nuclease protection assay
a 470 bp fragment of the rat pomc gene corresponding to 20 bp of intron
a, 180 bp of exon 2 and 270 bp of intron b was used to quantify nuclear
pomc rna (20).
a 111-bp fragment of the rat  xxxg798xxx  cdna was used as a standard
for mrna quantification (22).
the sense rna standard and antisense rna probes ( labelled to 109
c.p.m./mg with 32p utp) were generated using commercially available transcription reagents and protocol (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa). the sense
rna standard was diluted in 1×te and quantified by absorbance at an
optical density of 260 nm. five microliters were added to the assay; standard
curves were obtained in the range of 1–300 pg/tube.
twenty microliters of the hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 m
piperazine n-n∞ bis [2 ethane sulphonic acid ] (pipes) ph 7.4, 400 m nacl
and 1 m edta ph (8) and 1 ng antisense rna probe (quantified by
measuring incorporation of 32p and resuspended in hybridization buffer) were
added to each tube and the reactions mixture were heated to 85 °c for 5 min
and subsequently incubated overnight at 45 °c.
the hybridization mixtures were digested with rnase and purified as
previously described (20). the protected rna5rna hybrids were analysed
by electrophoresis through non denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. the gels
were dried. the bands formed by the protected rna5rna hybrids were
counted using a phosphoimager.
the amount of each rna species in the samples was calculated by
comparing the volume of the samples to standard curves generated by linear
regression of volume vs pg of sense standard. the mass of each protected
species was corrected for fragment size by multiplying the rna mass read
from standard curve by the ratio of the size of the full-length species to the

768 cox-1, cox-2 and  xxxg147xxx  and activation of the hpa axis
size of the protected band, 6 kb for pomc primary transcript and 1 kb for
 xxxg798xxx  mrna.
pomc and  xxxg798xxx  mrna were coassayed in anterior pituitary nuclear
fraction and the results expressed as the ratio of pomc (pg rna) vs
 xxxg798xxx  (pg rna)

statistical analysis

discussion

data are shown as means±sem. one-way anova tests were used to
analyse the differences between groups, followed by student’s newman–keuls
post hoc test with a threshold of significance of **p<0.01 or *p<0.05 using
a statistical software package (sigmastat version 2.03; jandel scientific, san
rafael ca, usa).

in the present study, as found in previous studies, peripheral
il-1b (mimicking a peripheral infection or inflammation) led
to a strong activation of the hpa axis, involving both
increased secretion of acth and corticosterone concomitant
increase in anterior pituitary pomc gene transcription (23).
the limited entry of il-1 into the cns has led to the
hypothesis that il-1b stimulates hpa axis activity via an
enhanced production of prostaglandins, which in turn act at
the pvn. to explore the involvement of metabolic  xxxd208xxx  pathways in mediating hpa axis activation
induced by il-1b, we used  xxxd2423xxx , a nonspecific cox-1
and cox-2 activity inhibitor; ns 398, a specific cox-2
activity inhibitor; and bw a4c, a specific  xxxg147xxx  activity
inhibitor.
we demonstrated that these inhibitors do not directly
stimulate the hpa axis parameters recorded in this study. in
rats injected with  xxxd2423xxx  or ns 398 or bw a4c alone,
we observed no stimulation of acth or corticosterone
secretion, or of pomc gene transcription in the anterior
pituitary.
despite the pharmacological dose of bw a4c that we
used (24), the present data indicate that  xxxg147xxx  is not
involved in the hpa axis response to i.p. il-1b. indeed, the
specific  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor (bw a4c ) failed to prevent the  xxxg1170xxx -induced increase in acth and corticosterone secretions
and in pomc primary transcript levels in the anterior
pituitary. this result fits with other in vivo studies in mice
(25) and with in vitro studies using hypothalamus incubations
(16), which reported the absence of an effect of a  xxxg147xxx 
inhibitor on crh release induced by il-1b.
our results suggest that eicosanoids are keys mediators in
the activation of the hpa axis induced by il-1b. indeed,
blockage of their synthesis by a nonselective cox-1/cox-2
activity inhibitor ( xxxd2423xxx ) completely abolished the  xxxg1170xxx -induced rises in acth and corticosterone secretion and
in pomc nuclear primary transcript levels in the anterior
pituitary. this result corroborated previous reports that

several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the exact
neuronal route by which il-1-induced prostaglandins activate
the hpa axis. the selectivity of the neuronal response could
be a consequence of a fine interaction between nonparenchymal prostaglandins synthesis and the expression of the specific
prostaglandin receptors in different brain nuclei. in particular,
the observations that il-1b-induced acceleration of hypothalamic noradrenaline turnover was blocked by a pretreatment
with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor (39) and that il-1b- and
prostaglandin-binding sites are present in brainstem regions,
suggest that prostaglandin-mediated activation of catecholaminergic brainstem nuclei could be one mechanism by which
peripheral il-1b stimulates the hpa axis. several results are
in accordance with this theory. crf neurones, which are
involved during il-1b hpa axis stimulation, are under a
strong catecholaminergic control originating from brainstem
nuclei (40). moreover, il-1b is able to increase the noradrenaline turnover in the hypothalamus, whereas destruction
of catecholaminergic inputs to the pvn inhibits the hpa
axis response to induced by il-1b (41, 42). a recent study
(26) demonstrated that pretreatment with indomethacin,
before il-1b administration, significantly reduced the plasma

acth release and c-fos expression in the pvn, and reduced
c-fos expression in the a1/c1 catecholaminergic cells of the
ventrolateral medulla and in the a2/c2 catecholamine cells
of the nucleus of the solitary tract. the poah is another
potential site by which il-1-induced pgs could stimulate the
hpa axis. the poah contains a high density for prostaglandins receptors (43), and prostaglandins receptor mrna
(44). moreover microinjection of a prostaglandins antagonist
into the poah inhibited il-1b-induced acth secretion
(30). finally, the median eminence, which contains the
terminal projection of pvn neurones, could be a potential
site by which il-1b could activate crf release without
affecting perikarya. however, it has been observed that
prostaglandins play an intermediate role, since the effect of
injection of il-1b into the median eminence was markedly
reduced by indomethacin (31).
in our study, an interesting result was obtained with the
selective cox-2 inhibitor (ns 398). in ns 398+il-1b
treated rats, il-1b had no effect on plasma acth, nor
pomc primary transcript levels in the anterior pituitary.
this suggests that cox-2 activity is essential in the mediation
of the effect of il-1b on the hpa axis. several recent findings
