abstract: biotin synthase (biob) is an iron-sulfur dimeric enzyme which catalyzes the last step in
biotin synthesis. the reaction consists of the introduction of a sulfur atom into dethiobiotin. it is shown
here that biob displays a significant cysteine desulfurase activity, providing it with the ability to mobilize
sulfur from  xxxd1788xxx . this activity is dependent on pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp) and dithiothreitol
and proceeds through a protein-bound persulfide. like other cysteine desulfurases, biob binds 1 equiv of
plp. by site-directed mutagenesis, two conserved cysteines, cys97 and cys128, are shown to be critical
for cysteine desulfuration and are good candidates as the site for a persulfide. since biotin synthase activity
is greatly increased by plp and cysteine, even though it does not exceed 1 nmol of biotin/nmol of monomer,
it is proposed that cysteine desulfuration is intimately linked to biotin synthesis. new scenarios for sulfur
insertion into dethiobiotin, in which cysteine persulfides play a key role, are discussed.

biotin synthase (biob)1 catalyzes the last step of the biotin
biosynthetic pathway (1). the reaction consists of the
introduction of a sulfur atom into dethiobiotin, thus requiring
activation of c-h bonds (scheme 1). biotin synthase from
escherichia coli is a homodimer of 76 kda, with each
polypeptide chain carrying an oxygen-sensitive (4fe-4s)
cluster, probably ligated by three cysteines of a cxxxcxxc
box conserved among all known biob sequences and a fourth
still not identified ligand (2-9). site-directed mutants of
biob in which these cysteines (cys53, cys57, and cys60)
have been changed into alanine are inactive (8). recently,
ugulava and co-workers suggested that the active form of
biob contained an additional cluster, a (2fe-2s) one, per
polypeptide chain (10, 11).
in recent years,  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) and an
electron-donating system consisting of nadph, flavodoxin
reductase (fpr), and flavodoxin (fldx) were shown to be
required for activity (3, 12). this is strong evidence that
biotin synthase belongs to a large class of enzymes, the socalled “radical-sam superfamily”, defined on the basis that
(i) they use a reduced iron-sulfur center and  xxxd3156xxx  (also
abbreviated as sam) for catalysis and (ii) they all contain a
cxxxcxxc sequence providing the cysteine ligands to the
cluster (13-16). the  xxxd3156xxx /fe-s combination is supposed, in the case of prototypic enzymes such as the
anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, pyruvate formate lyase,
and lysine aminomutase, to generate a 5′-deoxyadenosyl
radical which initiates the reaction. in the case of biotin

scheme 1: reaction catalyzed by biotin synthase (biob)

synthase, we have recently shown that, indeed, the reduced
(4fe-4s)+ form of the cluster is competent for a one-electron
reduction of  xxxd3156xxx  (17). this provides a clue about the
mechanism of the reaction since a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical
would be suitable for activation of dethiobiotin, through
hydrogen atom abstraction at c9 and c6 (18). the resulting
carbon radicals are supposed to be reactive for incorporation
of a sulfur atom.
the following intriguing questions associated with biotin
synthase have been addressed over the past 10 years.
first, despite extensive studies, an efficient enzymatic
system is not available yet. the reported activities with welldefined assay mixtures rarely exceed 1 nmol of biotin/nmol
of monomer. this failure to obtain mutiple turnovers has
sometimes been put forward to propose that biotin synthase
is not an enzyme but a reactant. alternatively, this may reflect
the fact that extra important cofactors, not identified yet, are

missing, in agreement with the observation that moderately
increased activities are obtained when assay mixtures are
complemented with bacterial soluble extracts. finally, one
cannot exclude the possibility that an irreversible inactivation,
by some unknown mechanisms, occurs in vitro.
second, the question of the source of the sulfur atom that
ends up into biotin is still a matter of controversy and
investigation. whereas whole-cell experiments suggested that
in vivo cysteine is the source of sulfur for biotin biosynthesis
(3, 19), in vitro assays have not allowed an unambiguous
identification of the final sulfur donor, even though  xxxd3156xxx 
as well as dtt, generally present in reaction mixtures, could
be excluded (12, 20). the most recent scenario involves the
bridging sulfur atoms of an iron-sulfur center as the species
being trapped by the intermediate substrate radicals (21). this
function has first been suggested to reside in the (4fe-4s)
cluster (21, 22) and, more recently by ugulava et al., in the
(2fe-2s) cluster present in their preparations (10, 11). in e.
coli, three additional cysteines (cys97, cys128, and cys188)
proved to play a key role in biotin synthesis by site-directed
mutagenesis (8). since they are not involved in ligation of
the (4fe-4s) cluster and not required for  xxxd3156xxx  reduction
(8, 17), they might function as a site for the (2fe-2s) center
proposed by ugulava et al. and thus be essential during sulfur
incorporation into the substrate.
in this paper, we report the discovery that biob displays
a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent cysteine desulfurase activity, which allows mobilization of the sulfur atom from free
cysteine. site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates the involvement of cys97 and cys128 in this activity. the implications
for the mechanism of sulfur insertion into biotin are
discussed.
experimental procedures
materials. all chemicals were reagent grade and obtained
from sigma-aldrich chemical co. or fluka unless otherwise
stated. 5-deaza-7,8-demethyl-10-methylisoalloxazine (5daf) was prepared according to the method of ashton et
al. (23).  xxxd3156xxx  was from boehringer mannheim. pyridoxal
5′-phophate was from interchim. flavodoxin, flavodoxin
reductase, and  xxxg1562xxx  were available in our laboratory.
preparation of biotin synthase. biob was overexpressed
in the bl21(de3) e. coli strain carrying the pkh200 plasmid
as previously described (5, 7, 8). biob was also expressed
in the  xxxg1562xxx - e. coli  xxxg664xxx  strain lacking an active cysteine
desulfurase  xxxg1562xxx  gene, provided by d. dean (blacksburg,
va) (24). for that purpose, the pkh200 plasmid was
introduced into competent  xxxg664xxx  lyzogenized using a de3
lysogenization kit (novagen). overexpression and purification procedures were standard (5, 7, 8).
preparation of reconstituted biotin synthase. mutant and
wild-type apobiob proteins were prepared and reconstituted
with fe(nh4)2(so4)2 and na2s as previously described (5,
7, 8). reconstituted proteins were desalted over sephadex
g-25 to remove adventitiously bound iron and sulfide.
reconstitution of biotin synthase with plp. biotin synthase proteins (apobiob, biob, and recbiob) were incubated
anaerobically with 10 mm dtt at 20 °c in a total volume
of 500 µl. after reaction for 30 min, proteins were further
incubated for 4 h with 5 equiv of plp. the excess of plp
was then removed anaerobically by dialysis against 2 × 1 l

ollagnier-de-choudens et al.
of 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8) and 30 mm kcl. in some
experiments, the resulting protein solution (400 µl) was
treated with 1 mm nabh4 for 5 min at room temperature
and analyzed for light absorption and activities, after dialysis.
biotin synthase activity. the activity was assayed from
the amount of biotin formed from dethiobiotin (dtb). the
standard reaction mixture in a final volume of 50 µl of 0.1
m tris-hcl (ph 8) and 50 mm kcl contained 1.7 nmol of
biotin synthase (apobiob, biob, and recbiob), 400 µm
dtb, 5 mm dtt, 150 µm  xxxd3156xxx , 20 µm flavodoxin, 4
µm flavodoxin reductase, 1 mm nadph, 2 mm cysteine,
and 1 equiv of plp. the reaction was monitored at 37 °c
for 3-4 h and stopped by the addition of 10% (v/v) 1 m
tca. after centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins,
the supernatant was assayed for biotin formation by a
microbiological method using lactobacillus plantarum (25).
to accurately measure the amount of biotin that was
synthesized, we put standards on each plate, and all the data
presented in this paper represent the average of at least
duplicate experiments.
cysteine desulfurase activity. biotin synthase proteins (4
nmol) (apobiob, biob, recbiob, or mutants) were incubated
at 20 or 37 °c with 20 mm dtt in a total volume of 100
µl. after incubation for 30 min, plp (4 nmol) and 2 mm
l-cysteine were added to the reaction mixture. at time
intervals, the reaction was stopped by addition of 10% (v/v)
1 m tca and the mix left on ice for 15 min. precipitated
protein was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15 000
rpm and the solution dried on a speed-vac. the residue was
dissolved in 150 µl of a citrate buffer (ph 2.2). a ninhydrin
derivative was generated and analyzed at 570 nm by hplc
on a system 7300 beckman apparatus working with an ion
exchange column (s101036) calibrated with pure amino acid
standards and developed by stepwise ph changes according
to a published procedure (26).
analysis. protein concentrations (by monomer) were
determined by the method of bradford (27) standardized with
bovine  xxxg124xxx . a correction factor of 1.1 is applied
according to dry weight measurements from amino acid
analysis. the amount of protein-bound iron was determined
under reducing conditions with bathophenanthroline disulfonate after acid denaturation of the protein (28) and labile
sulfide by the method of beinert (29). the amount of
enzyme-bound pyridoxal 5-phosphate was determined spectrophotometrically by the phenylhydrazine method (30).
identification of the biob-bound persulfide. the biobbound persulfide was identified according to the procedure
of zheng and colleagues (31). inside a glovebox, biob in
0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8.0) and 50 mm kcl was treated with
25 mm dtt for 1 h, isolated from the latter by nap-10
chromatography (pharmacia), and divided into two portions.
in the first portion, 265 nmol of the protein was incubated
for 1 h at 37 °c with 270 nmol of plp and 2 mm cysteine.
the second portion (500 nmol) was kept under the same
conditions without plp and cysteine. then a 20-fold excess
of the persulfide alkylating reagent n-(iodoacetyl)-n′-(5sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (i-aedans) (lambda ) 337
nm,  ) 5000 m-1 cm-1) was added to both samples, and
the mixtures were incubated further for 1 h at 19 °c. after
removal of all low-molecular weight components by nap10 chromatography, the protein solutions (1 ml) were filtered
on nanosep ultrafiltration devices (2 × 1 ml). the filtrates

cysteine desulfurase activity of biob
were checked by uv-vis spectroscopy inside the glovebox
and proved to display only negligible absorption at 337 nm.
both protein solutions (400 µl) were then reacted with dtt
(10 mm) for 30 min and filtered again on nanosep
cartridges. the filtrate of the plp- and cys-treated samples
exhibited a strong absorption at 337 nm corresponding to
the thio derivative n-(thioacetyl)-n′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (0.3-0.5 mol/mol of biob monomer)
derived from reduction of the mixed protein-aedans
disulfide. in the control experiment, the absorption at 337
nm corresponded to 0.02 mol/mol of biob monomer. the
solutions were then loaded onto a lightc18 sep-pak (waters)
column equilibrated in water. after being washed with 4 ×
1 ml of water, the 337 nm-absorbing compounds were
collected in a 60:40 (v:v) ch3cn/h2o mixture (500 µl).
after addition of 50 µl of 1 m nh4oh and 5 µl of
iodomethane, the reaction was allowed to proceed at ambient
temperature for 1 h. the solutions were then freeze-dried
and analyzed by mass spectrometry (es-ms) working with
negative ion detection. only one compound (m- ) 353.1)
corresponding to the methylthio derivative of aedans was
detected. ms/ms of this ion gave rise to daughter peaks at
265.1 and 221.1 corresponding to the two fragments derived
from cleavage at the aromatic amino position.
uv-visible spectroscopy. uv-visible spectra of the biob
protein, in 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 8) and 50 mm kcl, were
recorded under anaerobic conditions directly inside the
glovebox with a uvikon xl100 instrument (biotek).
mass spectrometry. the mass spectra were acquired on a
lcq-ion trap (finnigan-thermoquest, san jose, ca), equipped
with an electrospray source.
electrospray full scan spectra, in the range of m/z 50600, were obtained by infusion through fused silica tubing
at a rate of 2-10 µl/min. the solutions were analyzed in
the negative mode. the lcq calibration (m/z 50-2000) was
achieved according to the standard calibration procedure from
the manufacturer (mixture of  xxxd404xxx , mrfa, and ultramark
1621). the temperature of the heated capillary of the lcq
trap was set to 150 °c, and the ion spray voltage was in the
range of 1-6 kv with an injection time of 5-200 ms.
results
different preparations of biob. three different forms of
biotin synthase were used in this study. biob designates the
dimeric protein purified from an overexpressing strain of e.
coli, as previously described (7). this preparation contains
a small amount of iron and sulfide (1.0-1.5 per polypeptide
chain) due to loss of the cluster during chromatography and
accordingly displays low biotin synthase activity. apobiob
is obtained by anaerobic reduction of biob by photoreduced
deazaflavin in the presence of 10 mm edta followed by
chromatography on sephadex g25 (7). as a consequence,
it does not contain any measurable iron and sulfide. finally,
recbiob is obtained from apobiob by treatment with a 5-fold
excess of both  xxxd2385xxx  and sulfide in the presence of
dtt followed by desalting on sephadex-g25, all steps
carried out anaerobically within a glovebox. from one
preparation to another, recbiob was found to chelate between
three and four iron and sulfur atoms per polypeptide chain.
whereas the major part of the iron (60-80%) resides in a
(4fe-4s)2+ cluster, small and variable amounts of iron are

biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 29, 2002 9147
found within (2fe-2s)2+ clusters and mononuclear fe2+
species, as shown by mössbauer spectroscopy (7, 17). the
incomplete (4fe-4s) assembly or lack of clusters altogether
in some monomers probably reflects the lability of the cluster
and its sensitivity to oxygen, as previously noted (7).
however, under the reducing conditions required for activity,
mobilization of iron and sulfur occurs to generate more (4fe4s) clusters in the +1 (s ) 1/2) oxidation state (80-90% of
total iron), which is the active form of the cluster during
 xxxd3156xxx  reductive cleavage (7, 17).
biob was also overexpressed within the e. coli  xxxg664xxx 
strain, lacking an active  xxxg1562xxx  cysteine desulfurase gene (24),
from which the three forms apobiob, biob, and recbiob
were prepared.
biob is a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent cysteine desulfurase. in preliminary experiments, we discovered that
incubation of biob (1.2 fe and 1.5 s atoms per polypeptide
chain) with 1 mm l-cysteine and 5 mm dtt, within an
anaerobic glovebox, resulted in the slow formation of alanine
(0.4-0.6 nmol/nmol of monomer biob over 4 h at 20 °c).
an approximately stoichiometric amount of sulfide was
formed under these conditions. no alanine could be detected
when biob or l-cysteine was omitted from the reaction
mixture, or when l-cysteine was replaced with d-cysteine.
omission of dtt resulted in greatly decreased rates of
alanine formation (0.1 nmol/nmol of monomer over 4 h).
addition of dethiobiotin,  xxxd3156xxx , and atp or a reducing
agent (photoactivated deazaflavin) had no effect on the
reaction. finally, since pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp) is a
common cofactor for cysteine desulfurase (31), we next
included 1 equiv of plp, with regard to biob, in the assay
mixture. this led to a large increase in activity (2 nmol/
nmol of monomer over 4 h). to exclude the possibility that
such a low activity would be due to the presence of  xxxg1562xxx , a
potent cysteine desulfurase, as a contaminant, recombinant
biob from the e. coli  xxxg664xxx  strain lacking an active  xxxg1562xxx 
gene (24) was assayed and found to display similar properties
in terms of plp-dependent cysteine desulfurase activities.
characterization of the cysteine desulfurase activity of
biob. on the basis of the experiments described above, the
cysteine desulfurase activity of biob was studied as a
function of dtt, cysteine, and plp concentration during a
4 h incubation at 20 °c. as shown in figure 1a, dtt (20
mm) provided a 10-fold stimulation of the cysteine desulfurase activity (1 mm cysteine, 1 equiv of plp with regard
to biob). figure 1b shows that the highest activity was
obtained for 1 mm cysteine (in the presence of 10 mm dtt)
and a slight inhibition for higher concentrations. a km value
of 30 µm for cysteine could be derived from the data
depicted in figure 1b. finally, figure 1c shows that the
addition of 1 equiv of plp was sufficient to obtain the highest
activity, and no inhibition was observed for higher concentrations. it should be noted that, in the presence of cysteine
and dtt, a significant activity remained upon omission of
plp, suggesting that biob contains a small amount of
protein-bound plp. on this basis, we could establish an assay
with 4 nmol of biob monomer, 20 mm dtt, 2 mm cysteine,
and 4 nmol of plp. under these optimal conditions, the
production of alanine and sulfide was linear for at least 4 h
as shown by the time curve of figure 2. finally, as shown
in table 1, cysteine desulfurase activity proved to depend
greatly on the amount of iron cluster within the protein since

the reaction stopped at different times. activities are defined as
nanomoles of alanine (b) or sulfide (o) produced per nanomole
of monomer.

with 5 nmol of recbiob monomer for 4 h at 20 °c. activities are
defined as nanomoles of alanine per nanomole of monomer.

apobiob was more than 10 times less active than biob
whereas recbiob displayed the highest activity.
cysteine desulfurases are thought to generate proteinbound persulfides which can be detected after reaction with
an alkylating probe, n-(iodoacetyl)-n′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (i-aedans) (31). the product of that
reaction is a mixed disulfide which, upon reduction with
dtt, releases the thio derivative of the probe to be
quantitated. biob, after incubation at 37 °c for 1 h with 2
mm cysteine, in the presence of 1 equiv of plp and in the
absence of dtt was assayed for persulfide, as described in
experimental procedures, and found to contain ∼0.3-0.5
nmol of persulfide/nmol of biob monomer. in a control
experiment with the same preparation before reaction with
cysteine and plp, no persulfide could be detected.
as cys97, cys128, and cys188 were previously shown
to be required for biotin synthesis (8, 17), the corresponding
reconstituted cys-to-ala site-directed mutants (recbiob
forms), which have no detectable biotin synthase activity,
were assayed for cysteine desulfurase at 37 °c. as shown
in table 2, mutations of cys97 and cys128 resulted in

enzymes with only ∼5% of the activity of the wild-type
enzyme. instead, the activity of the cys188ala mutant
protein was only slightly affected.
plp binding to biob. the discovery that plp was a key
cofactor for the cysteine desulfurase activity of biob led us
to speculate that biotin synthase is a plp-dependent enzyme
and that most of the protein-bound plp was lost during
purification. for determination of the level of binding plp,
we used a common colorimetric assay, based on titration of
plp released upon protein boiling (30). this assay was
validated with  xxxg1562xxx , a plp-dependent cysteine desulfurase
involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly (32). plp was
found to be present in biob (0.05 mol of plp per monomer).

the difference spectrum is shown in the inset, which highlights

the spectral change is consistent with the presence of 0.24 nmol

highlights the absorption decrease in the 420 nm region and the
increase at 325 nm upon reduction.

however, incubation of biob with a 5-fold excess of plp
for 4 h followed by extensive dialysis resulted in an increase
in the amount of protein-bound plp. from one preparation
of biob to another, between 0.3 and 0.4 mol of plp was
found attached to 1 mol of biob monomer (table 1). in
figure 3 are shown the light absorption spectra of biob
before and after treatment with plp. they now show slight
differences in the 400 nm region as a consequence of the
increased level of plp binding. the difference spectrum
displayed one major band at 410 nm highly characteristic
for plp (inset of figure 3). the absorbance at 410 nm was
consistent with the amount of plp determined colorimetrically. plp could be irreversibly bound to biob upon
reduction with sodium borohydride, suggesting a ketinimine
linkage between plp and biob as expected for a plpdependent enzyme. as shown in figure 4, the 420 nm
absorption band was bleached by addition of nabh4,
concomitant with an absorption increase at 325 nm. these

µm).

changes are characteristic of reduction of an aldimine linkage
between plp and a lysine residue (33).
the capacity of biob to bind plp was found to be
dependent on the total amount of protein-bound iron cluster:
apobiob was unable to bind plp, whereas recbiob could
bind as much as 0.7-1 mol of plp per polypeptide chain,
the largest amount obtained when the incubation with plp
was carried out in the presence of dtt (table 1). when
recbiob was exposed to air and desalted, a reaction resulting
in the loss of ∼50% of the iron and sulfide as previously
shown (7), the maximal amount of plp that could bind to
the protein was ∼0.4 mol/mol of monomer.
stimulation of biotin synthase activity by cysteine and
plp. to check whether this cysteine desulfurase activity is
involved in biotin synthesis, we studied the dependence of
biotin synthase activity on cysteine and plp. the results are
shown in figure 5, using recbiob as the enzyme form.
whereas a small activity was observed in the absence of
cysteine and plp, addition of both compounds resulted in
both an important acceleration and an increased yield of
biotin production. maximal activity was obtained with the
addition of 1 equiv of plp (data not shown). however, even
under these optimal conditions, the production of biotin
leveled off after reaction for 3 h when ∼1 nmol of biotin/
nmol of biob monomer was formed (figure 5). as shown
in table 1, biotin synthase activity in the presence of plp
and cysteine was dependent on the amount of cluster in the
protein. the biob preparation from the  xxxg1562xxx - e. coli  xxxg664xxx 
strain displays similar plp-dependent biotin synthase activities. table 1 also shows that both biotin synthase and cysteine
desulfurase activities are greatly decreased upon treatment
of plp-containing recbiob with nabh4.
discussion
the species that donates sulfur to dethiobiotin to form
biotin has been the subject of a number of contradictory
studies. despite inconsistencies between reports, some
generalizations may be drawn. first, when crude cell-free
bacterial extracts were included in biotin synthase assays,
the sulfur from cysteine was incorporated into biotin, as
shown from experiments in which [35s]cysteine was used
(3, 34). second, biotin synthase activity can be assayed in
the absence of crude extracts in vitro, using purified

9150 biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 29, 2002
preparations of the enzyme, dethiobiotin, nadph, flavodoxin reductase, flavodoxin,  xxxd3156xxx , dithiothreitol (dtt),
cysteine, iron, and sulfide (2, 3, 9, 10). the stimulating
effects of fe and sulfide were then supposed to reflect the
necessity of maintaining an active iron-sulfur cluster during
the reaction. third, when the same assay was carried out
with a partially purified biotin synthase, expressed in cells
growing in the presence of [35s]cysteine, efficient incorporation of the isotopic label into biotin was observed in the
absence of added exogenous sulfur donors (35). this,
together with the lack of enzyme turnover, led to the
suggestion that biotin synthase was a reagent and not a
catalyst and that the sulfur atom was coming either from a
cysteine residue from the protein or from an iron-sulfur
center. at about the same time, marquet et al. proposed that
the cluster was the sulfur donor, since transfer of 34s from a
biotin synthase preparation, in which the cluster was labeled
with 34s by chemical or enzymatic reconstitution, to biotin
was demonstrated (21).
in all these reports, biob was assumed to contain a single
cluster. however, the type and number of iron-sulfur
clusters in biob have also been a matter of controversy. a
first proposal, based on spectroscopic studies (2), envisioned
a (2fe-2s) center which could, under reducing conditions,
convert into one (4fe-4s) center bridging the two subunits
of the dimer (4). this proposal was then challenged when
we (7) and others (9) demonstrated that anaerobic preparations of biob could bind as many as four fe and four s
atoms per monomer in the form of (4fe-4s)2+/1+ clusters
which undergo degradation into (2fe-2s) clusters upon
exposure to air (7-9, 36). finally, a recent report from
ugulava et al. suggested the presence of two different clusters
in biotin synthase, a (4fe-4s) cluster involved in the
conversion of dethiobiotin into a radical and a (2fe-2s) one
proposed to be the source of sulfur atoms for incorporation
into this radical (10, 11). this was supported by spectroscopic
analysis of the enzyme during a single turnover, leading to
the conclusion that during catalysis the (4fe-4s) center was
preserved while the (2fe-2s) cluster was destroyed. with
this hypothesis that a cluster would be the species donating
sulfur to the substrate, a two-cluster model is more attractive
than a one-cluster one. indeed, in the latter, biob would be
fully inactivated after each turnover for both  xxxd3156xxx 
reductive cleavage and sulfur transfer. on the other hand,
in both scenarios, the enzyme needs to be reconstituted for
multiple turnovers. since, in general, no more than 1 mol of
biotin can be formed per mole of biob monomer in vitro,
one still wonders whether biob is a reactant or requires still
unidentified specific reactivating machinery which is still
unknown.
on the basis of the results reported here, we propose a
novel scenario in which an unanticipated activity of biotin
synthase would play an essential role during sulfur transfer.
here we show for the first time that biotin synthase displays
a significant cysteine desulfurase activity in the presence of
dtt: it has an intrinsic ability to mobilize the sulfur atom
from cysteine by catalyzing the conversion of  xxxd1788xxx 
into alanine and free sulfur, with l-cysteine and not dcysteine being a substrate. contamination by the potent
cysteine desulfurase  xxxg1562xxx  is excluded since biob preparations
from an e. coli strain lacking an active  xxxg1562xxx  displayed similar
activities. like all cysteine desulfurases reported so far, this

activity critically depends on the presence of plp and thus
certainly proceeds by similar mechanisms, namely, through
the intermediate formation of a substrate cysteine-pyridoxal
phosphate ketinimine adduct and subsequent nucleophilic
attack by the thiolate anion of an active protein-bound
cysteine (31). these events result in formation of a proteinbound persulfide and a plp-bound enamine which is
ultimately released as alanine. here we show that biotin
synthase binds 1 equiv of plp and, in the presence of
cysteine, is able to generate a protein-bound persulfide.
although there is in biob no obvious sequence corresponding to plp-binding motifs (33), a good candidate for a plp
binding site could be lysine 49, just upstream from the
cxxxcxxc sequence, a very highly conserved lysine in
biob sequences (only biob from heliobacter pylori contains
an arginine at this position). the changes observed in the
visible spectrum during reaction with nabh4 are indeed
characteristic of the reduction of an aldimine linkage between
plp and a lysine residue (33). further experiments, including
site-directed mutagenesis studies, are required to identify this
site.
it is noteworthy that the presence of an iron-sulfur center
is important for plp binding and thus for cysteine desulfurase
activity (table 1). lysine 2,3-aminomutase provides a
precedent for an enzyme carrying both an iron-sulfur center
and plp (33). also in this case, a correlation between plp
content and fe and s content has been observed. the reason
plp has not been observed in earlier biob preparations thus
likely resides in the lability of the cluster. during purification,
a large amount of iron and sulfide and most of the plp are
lost. furthermore, the cluster and plp absorb light in the
same energy range, and the small amounts of plp in the
purified enzyme could not be easily detected. finally, the
importance of the cysteine desulfurase activity of biob
during biotin synthesis is suggested from the maximal
acceleration of the rates of biotin formation caused by
addition of 1 equiv of plp and cysteine (figure 5) and the
rather good correlation between both activities (table 1).
unfortunately, one must note that the plp/cysteine combination does not by itself provide the conditions for multiple
turnovers, since, again, the reaction leveled off after formation of ∼1 nmol/nmol of monomer. furthermore, the origin
of the residual activity in the absence of plp is unclear at
that stage.
we recently found that in addition to the three cysteines,
namely, cys53, cys57, and cys60, of the cxxxcxxc
sequence specific for the enzymes of the radical-sam family
(13), biob from e. coli requires, to be active, cys97, cys128,
and cys188 (8). the first three have been shown to provide
the ligands to the (4fe-4s) center (8). since mutations at
the three last cysteines resulted in proteins with the ability
to assemble a (4fe-4s) center with both spectroscopic
features comparable to those of wild-type biob and good
activity during  xxxd3156xxx  reductolysis, they were excluded as
ligands to that cluster, leaving thus open the question of the
nature of the fourth ligand (8). now we show that cys97
and cys128 are critical to the cysteine desulfurase activity
of biob since replacement with an alanine resulted in a
drastic impairment of that activity. it is tempting to suggest
that one of these two cysteines is the site of the intermediate
persulfide. it is too early to tell what the exact function of
the second cysteine is, but one possibility is that it participates

formation of biotin.

in the liberation of the sulfur atom from the persulfide,
resulting in the formation of a disulfide bridge between
cys97 and cys128. a similar combination of two cysteines
has been suggested during another biological sulfur transfer
reaction involving transient persulfide and a disulfide bridge,
namely, the last step of 4-thiouridine synthesis catalyzed by
thii (37). in our case, a similar mechanism would imply an
effect of the mutations more drastic than that observed here,
unless both cysteines have the potential to generate a
persulfide. more experiments are needed to understand the
specific function of cys97 and cys128. the function of
cys188, which is fully conserved, remains to be identified.
the discovery of a plp-dependent cysteine desulfurase
activity for biotin synthase leads us to propose a new
mechanism for biotin production shown in figure 6. in the
first step, the (4fe-4s) cluster catalyzes the one-electron
reduction of  xxxd3156xxx  by reduced flavodoxin. the resulting
cleavage of  xxxd3156xxx  gives rise to methionine and the 5′deoxyadenosyl radical which subsequently abstracts one h
atom at position 6 or 9 of dethiobiotin (dtb). in a second
step, sulfur transfer from cysteine to the substrate radical
proceeds through the intermediate formation of a reactive
protein-bound persulfide species at cys97 or cys128. in this
mechanism, the persulfide would serve, with the collaboration of a second cysteine, as a species directly donating a
sulfur atom to the radical. this is clearly inconsistent with

biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 29, 2002 9151
the suggestion by ugulava et al. that an iron-sulfur center
is the sulfur donor (10, 11). nevertheless, the biob preparation used in this study and lacking a second (2fe-2s) cluster
displays, in the presence of plp and cysteine and with no
additional iron and sulfide, reasonable enzyme activities
(figure 5). a second possibility is that persulfides would be
intermediates during synthesis in the same polypeptide of a
(2fe-2s) cluster which then would give its sulfur atoms to
the radical (figure 6). there is an increasing amount of
evidence that persulfides are intermediates during biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters (38-40). however, in general,
the cysteine desulfurase protein is different from the ironsulfur protein, and sulfur transfer between the two proteins
proceeds by persulfide exchange from the cysteine of the
first protein to a cysteine of the second one. a well-studied
example is the process of cluster synthesis in iscu mediated
by  xxxg1562xxx , both proteins belonging to the isc operon involved
in iron-sulfur cluster assembly (40). this mechanism would
be much more consistent with ugulava’s proposal (10).
however, it raises the question of the origin of the iron
needed to make an additional (2fe-2s) center in our assay
and would thus suggest that a significant part of the (4fe4s) center as well as iron impurities would be mobilized for
that purpose, which we find to be rather unlikely. further
experiments are clearly needed to find out how to reconcile
these seemingly divergent observations. nevertheless, our
results suggest that sulfur insertion into biotin follows the
general persulfide-dependent mechanism operating in the
biosynthesis of other sulfur-containing compounds (41).
as biob behaves as a very versatile system with at least
three different activities ( xxxd3156xxx  reduction, cysteine desulfuration, and biotin synthesis), it is likely that a complex
and novel chemistry, involving free radicals, persulfides, and
iron-sulfur clusters, is operating. more experiments are
needed to address, in addition to those mentioned above, the
problems of sluggishness and the apparent inactivation of
the enzyme.
