summary. the present study aimed at relating the presynaptic c~2-adrenoceptors, known to modulate noradrenaline and serotonin release, with the recently described
c~za- and c~2~-adrenoceptor subtypes. the effects of the
agonist oxymetazoline (selective for ~2a subtype) and of
three adrenoceptor antagonists (idazoxan, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (pmp) and  xxxd3000xxx , the last one known
to be c~2bselective) were evaluated on [3h]noradrenaline
and [3h]serotonin release in superfused synaptosomes
from rat brain cortex. these drugs were also tested in
[3h]yohimbine binding to human platelet membranes
(containing only e2a receptors) and to neonatal rat lung
membranes (containing only c~zbreceptors).
the affinity pattern of these compounds at c~2aadrenoceptors in binding studies was oxymetazoline > =
idazoxan > pmp >  xxxd3000xxx ; at c~2b-adrenoceptors it
was idazoxan > --  xxxd3000xxx  > pmp = oxymetazoline.
oxymetazoline inhibited with high and similar potencies
the k+-evoked [3h]noradrenaline and [ah]serotonin release, icso 18 and 7 nm, respectively; in the same conditions, the ics0 values of noradrenaline were 42 and
168 nm, respectively. the antagonist affinity pattern (antagonism against noradrenaline)
was idazoxan
> pmp >  xxxd3000xxx , either on [3h]serotonin release.
these results indicate that presynaptic e2 auto- or
heteroreceptors do not belong to the e2b subtype and
suggest that the modulation of noradrenaline and serotonin release may be mediated by the c~2a-adrenoceptor
subtype.

introduction
heterogeneity of ~2-adrenoceptors has been suggested by
different groups, mainly on the basis of "in vitro" binding
send offprint requests to m. gobbi at the above address

studies (cheung et al. 1982; alabaster et al. 1986;
dickinson et al. 1986; bylund et al. 1988). recently,
c~2-adrenoceptors have been divided into two subtypes
termed ~2a and ~2b according to their different pharmacological characteristics and regional distributions
(nahorski et al. 1985; bylund et al. 1988). human
platelets are the prototype tissue for e2a-receptors while
neonatal rat lung contains only e2b-receptors; in these
preparations yohimbine or idazoxan do not show any
particular selectivity whereas oxymetazoline has a high
selectivity for the ~2a subtype and  xxxd3000xxx  shows high
selectivity for the e2b subtype (bylund et al. 1988; young
et al. 1989). the genes for the two adrenoceptor subtypes
have recently been cloned and expressed in mammalian
cells (kobilka et al. 1987; regan et al. 1988).
in the rat cerebral cortex, e2-adrenoceptors are involved in the autoregulation of noradrenaline release
(autoreceptors) (mulder et al. 1978; hedler et al. 1981;
raiteri et al. 1983). in the same brain region, e2
heteroreceptors exist in serotonergic nerve endings and
their activation leads to inhibition of serotonin (5-ht)
release (g6thert et al. 1981; raiteri et al. 1983). autoand hetero-~2-adrenoceptors appear to differ pharmacologically since noradrenaline and clonidine showed higher
potency at the former (raiteri et al. 1983; maura et al.
1985) while (-) xxxd2637xxx  and 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (prop) had higher potency at the latter (maura et al.
1985; bianchi and garattini 1988; gobbi et al. 1990).
the relationship between these presynaptic ~2adrenoceptors and the e2a and ezb subtypes, both present
in rat cerebral cortex (cheung et al. 1982; dickinson et
al. 1986) in similar proportions (bylund 1988; young
et al. 1989), has not yet been clarified. in rat cortical
synaptosomes, the inhibition by 0.1 or 0.5 gm noradrenaline of the k +-evoked release of [3h]noradrenaline and
[3h]5-ht, respectively, was abolished by equimolar concentrations of yohimbine, whereas equimolar concentrations of  xxxd3000xxx  had no effect (raiteri et al. ~983).
similar data were obtained b y hedler et al. (1981),
g6thert et al. (1981) and frankhuyzen and mulder (1982)

methods
[3hi yohimbine binding to human platelet membranes. the method
described by mckernan et al. (1987) was used, with minor modifications. platelet-rich plasma obtained by centrifuging human blood
(collected from healthy volunteers) at 190 x g for 10 rain, was centrifuged at 2500 xg for 10 min. the pellets were frozen at - 2 0 ° c for
5 - 1 0 days and then resuspended in ice-cold "lysing buffer" (trishc1 50 ram, containing 0.5 mm edta and 0.1%  xxxd228xxx ,
ph7.4) using an ultra-turrax tp-1810 (30s, twice). the
homogenates were centrifuged at 50,000xg for 10 rain and the
pellets were resuspended as before; 250 gl of the platelet membrane
suspension was then incubated with 250 gl of the same buffer containing [3h]yohimbine (amersham, 84 ci/mmol, final concentration 2 rim) in absence or presence of different concentrations of
competing drugs (from 0.1nm to 10nm, in triplicate).
 xxxd2914xxx  10 gm was used to determine non-specific binding.
after 60 rain at 37°c, the samples were rapidly filtered under vacuum on whatman gf/c filters, which were washed three times with
3 ml fresh buffer and then counted for radioactivity in 8 ml filtercount (packard, groningen, netherlands).
[3 h] yohimbine binding to neonatal rat lung membranes. the method
described by bylund et al. (1988) was used. briefly, the lungs from
four one-day old rats (cd-cobs) were homogenized in 25 ml of
ice-cold tris-hc1 50 ram, ph 7.4, using an ultra-turrax tp-1810.
the homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000xg for 10 min. the
pellets were resuspended as before and the homogenate was filtered
through four gauze layers and centrifuged again at 50,000 × g for 10
rain. the pellets were then frozen at - 80° c. they were resuspended
10-15 days later in 25 ml of glycylglycine buffer 25 mm, ph 7.6,
and 0.5 ml aliquots of this suspension were incubated for 30 rain at
23°c in the presence of 2 nm [3h]yohimbine and different concentrations of competing drugs (from 0.t nm to 10 lam, in triplicate).
 xxxd2914xxx  10 gm was used to determine non-specific binding.
the samples were then rapidly filtered under vacuum on whatman
gf/b filters, which were washed three times with 3 ml tris-hc1
buffer 50 ram, ph 8, and counted for radioactivity in 8 ml filtercount.
[3h]noradrenaline and [3h]5-ht release. male cd-cobs rats
(charles river, italy), weighing about 150 g, were killed by decapitation and their cerebral cortices were rapidly dissected and

homogenized in 40 volumes of ice-chilled 0.32 m sucrose, ph 7.4,
in a glass homogenizer with teflon pestle. the homogenates were
centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 rain and the supernatants again centrifuged at 12000 x g for 20 min to yield the crude synaptosomal pellet
(p2) (gray and whittaker 1962; mulder et al. 1978; raiteri et al.
1983). the synaptosomes were resuspended in about 20 volumes of
krebs-henseleit buffer having the following composition (ram):
 xxxg2020xxx  125; kc1 3; cac12 1.2;  xxxd2534xxx  1.2; nahzpo4 1; nahco3
22; glucose 10; aeration with 95% o2 and 5% co2; ph 7.2-7.4.
q)he suspensions were added to an equal volume of the same buffer
containing [3h]5-ht (amersham, 27.8 ci/mmol or [3h](-)noradrenaline (amersham, 30.7 ci/mmol); the final concentration of
both radiochemicals was 0.06 ~tm. after incubation for 15 rain at
37° c, the solutions were diluted with buffer and 5-ml samples (1520 mg initial tissue for [3h]noradrenaline and 5 - 1 0 mg for [3h]5ht release) were distributed on 0.65 gm cellulose nitrate filters in a
16-chamber superfusion apparatus thermostated at 37°c (raiteri et
al. 1974). the synaptosomes were stratified on the filters by aspiration from the bottom under moderate vacuum. superfusion was
started (t = 0 rain) at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with standard medium
containing 1 ~tm desipramine. from t = 47 to t = 50 min, synaptosomes were depolarized by replacing the medium with a new one
containing a higher kc1 concentration (15 mm, replacing an equimolar concentration of  xxxg2020xxx ) with or without different concentrations of agonist. antagonists were present in the superfusion medium from t = 40 rain. fractions (2 rain each) were collected from
t = 42 until t = 60 rain and were counted for radioactivity, like the
filters, in 8 ml atom-light (nen, boston, ma, usa).
the percentage fractional release rate (frr) was calculated as
100 times the amount of radioactivity released into each 2-rain
fraction over the total radioactivity present on the filter at the
start of that fraction. the k +-evoked overflow, representing the
difference between the frr in presence and in absence of 15 mm
k +, was calculated by subtracting the mean frr value before (t =
44-48) and after (t = 54-58) the stimulus from each frr value
obtained during the stimulus (t = 48 - 54) and summing these differences (the effect of k +, added at t = 47, was detectable only 1 min
later, since the fluid took about 1 rain to flow from the filters to the
collecting vials). under these experimental conditions the radioactivity released by high k + consists mainly of unmetabolized
[3h]noradrenaline and [3h]5-ht (maura et al. 1985).

data analysis and statistics. binding inhibitioncurves were analyzed
according to the logistic function, by using the allfit program
(de lean et al. 1978) which gave the estimates (+ se) four parameter: the minimal and maximal effect (i. e. inferior and superior
plateaux of the sigmoidal curve), the ics0 (drug concentration producing half-maximal inhibition of [3h]yohimbine specific binding)
and the slope of the curve.
ki yalues were calculated from ics0s, using the relationship
ki = ic5o/(1 + [l]/kd) (cheng and prusoff 1973) where [l] is the
[3h]yohimbine concentration (2 nm) whereas kd is the ligand affinity (4 nm for human platelets and 9 nm for rat neonatal lung, data
not shown).
the potency of agonists in release experiments was evaluated
by measuring their ability to depress k+-induced overflow: the
inhibition curves were analyzed with the same logistic function to
obtain the maximal effect as well as the drug concentration producing half the maximal effect (ic50). the significance of the difference
between two ics0s was assessed using an f-test, according to the
"extra sum of squares" principle (de lean et al. 1978).
the kb values (apparent affinity of the antagonists) were calculated from the following equation: kb=[ant]/(ic'so/icso-l)
where ic'5o and icso represent the icso (molar) of the agonist
(noradrenaline) measured in presence and absence, respectively, of
a given antagonist concentration ([ant], molar). for each experiment, 3 - 4 noradrenaline concentrations were used in absence or
presence of a single antagonist concentration; the two curves were
analyzed assuming common maxima, minima and slopes, as verified
with the f-test. three different experiments were carried out for
each antagonist.

different experiments, with triplicate determinations, were done to
obtain each curve: when the same concentration was replicated, the
points represent the relative mean value. ordinate, overflow as %
of control

was the most potent compound, followed by pmp and
 xxxd3000xxx .
[ 3h] 5-ht release
figure 2 b shows that noradrenaline and oxymetazoline
inhibited also the k+-induced [3h]5-ht release from
cortical synaptosomes. in this case, oxymetazoline
reached the same maximal effect as obtained by
noradrenaline (39 _+ 3% and 37 5 6%, respectively), but,
compared with noradrenaline, it showed a markedly
higher potency (table l). neither noradrenaline nor
oxymetazoline affected the basal [315-ht release at the
concentrations used.
idazoxan and pmp antagonized the effect of noradrenaline, shifting to the right its inhibition curves. the
relative kb values are shown in table 1. idazoxan was
the most potent antagonist. the kb of prop was lower at
heteroreceptors than autoreceptors.  xxxd3000xxx  0.5 gm was
devoid of any antagonist property.
the baseline f r r was 2.2 _+ 0.1 (% per 2 rain) (t =
47 rain, before stimulus) and 2 . 0 _ 0.1 ( t = 57, after
stimulus); the k +-induced [3h]5-ht overflow, without
drugs, was 10.8 + 0.3% (mean + se, n = 6). idazoxan,
prop and  xxxd3000xxx  per se had no effects on basal or k +induced overflow.
discussion

the affinities of four drugs (oxymetazoline, idazoxan,
 xxxd3000xxx  and prop) for ~2a and e2b receptor subtypes

were measured. [3h]yohimbine binding on human
platelet membranes (containing only c~2a receptors) was
potently inhibited by oxymetazoline and idazoxan, the
latter being 9 and 66 times more active than prop and
 xxxd3000xxx , respectively. in neonatal rat lung membranes
(containing only c~2breceptors) [3h]yohimbine binding
was inhibited with similar affinities by idazoxan and
 xxxd3000xxx , followed by prop and oxymetazoline. idazoxan,
hence, was confirmed to be a non-selective c~e-adrenoceptor antagonist, oxymetazoline had a 35-fold higher affinity for the c~zasubtype whereas  xxxd3000xxx  showed a marked
selectivity (47 times) for the ee~ subtype.
in both preparations, we found absolute affinity
values 1 0 - 3 0 times lower than bylund et al. (1988). for
human platelets, the discrepancy could be due to the
different binding method used, while in the rat neonatal
lung preparation we used the method described by
bylund et al. (1988). however, the selectivity ratios of the
drugs between the two preparations and, most important
for the purpose of the present study, their rank order of
affinity within each preparation, are in agreement with
previous, more complete and specific, reports (dickinson
et al. 1986; bylund et al. 1988; young et al. 1989; regan
et al. 1989). therefore, we assume that our binding data
can be reliably used for comparison with prop, which
has not been studied previously in radioligand binding
experiments, and for relating these data with release experiments.
prop, the main metabolite of the antianxiety drug
buspirone, (caccia et al. 1983) did not show marked
selectivity for ~za or eeb receptor subtypes; compared
with  xxxd3000xxx , prop had 8 times higher affinity for c~zareceptors and 10 times lower affinity for ezb-receptors.
regarding presynaptic ~2-adrenoceptors, we confirm
that auto- and heteroreceptors can be pharmacologically
distinguished since noradrenaline was significantly more
potent at the former while prop was significantly more
potent at the latter. the rank order of potency of the
three antagonists tested in this study, however, was the
same either on auto- or heteroreceptors: idazoxan >
pmp >  xxxd3000xxx .
oxymetazoline behaved as a partial agonist on
autoreceptors, confirming previous data on cortical
(nasseri and minneman 1987) and hippocampal
(frankhuyzen and mulder 1982) slices, but appeared to
be a full agonist on heteroreceptors, as previously described by frankhuyzen and mulder (1982) in
hippocampal slices. at variance with this last study but
in agreement with nasseri and minneman (1987), we
found that oxymetazoline had similar potencies on autoor heteroreceptors, with icso values in the nanomolar
range.
the comparison between the data obtained with binding studies and the data obtained with release studies,
particularly the rank orders of affinity of antagonists and
the ic5 o values found with oxymetazoline, clearly exclude
the involvement of the c~2b-adrenoceptor subtype in the
modulation of [3h]noradrenaline and [3h]5-ht release
in rat brain cortex. despite the confirmed difference between auto- and heteroreceptors, our results show that
the pharmacological characterization of both of these
