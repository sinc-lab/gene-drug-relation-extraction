we have developed and tested a test system that
makes it possible to monitor recombination events and
estimate their frequency. this system was used to study
the effect of  xxxd3309xxx , a dna  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor, on illegitimate recombination. there were no
recombination events if illegitimate recombination was
induced by dna  xxxg2312xxx  in a minimal in vitro
system. in living cells, the inhibition of  xxxg2312xxx 
by  xxxd3309xxx  considerably increased the frequency of
illegitimate recombination. these data were interpreted
as evidence that most rearrangements caused by  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors in living cells are mediated by
the “induction” mechanism:  xxxg2312xxx  causes
only double-strand dna breaks, whereas their repair is
performed by other cell systems.
development of a test system for detecting illegitimate
recombination and estimating its frequency
numerous data published in recent years indicate
that the antitumor treatment using  xxxg2312xxx –
specific agents cause secondary leukemias characterized by specific chromosome rearrangements [1].
 xxxg2312xxx  can catalyze illegitimate recombination in vitro, especially in the presence of certain inhibitors [2, 3].
we have developed a system that makes it possible
to detect illegitimate recombination and estimate its
frequency. it is based on positive selection of deletion
mutants of the model plasmid. we constructed a plasmid containing two recombinogenic elements surrounding a marker “killer” gene under the control of an
inducible promoter. in the given case, the “killer” gene
was the ccdb gene encoding the bacterial gyrase inhibitor (this gene is part of the f factor support system)
under the control of the lac promoter. the expression of
this gene in bacterial cells leads to the death of bacteria.
deletion of the ccdb gene allow bacteria to grow and
form colonies in a medium containing the inducer of

ccdb expression (iptg); cells containing ccdb die
before they could begin to form colonies.
we used breakpoint cluster regions (bcrs) as
recombinogenic elements. these are the sites of
genomic rearrangements in vivo in some leukemias. to
exclude the possibility of homologous recombination,
we chose two different bcrs from genes  xxxg1996xxx  (a factor of lymphocyte maturation that is most often damaged in leukemias) [4] and eto, the most frequent rearrangement partner of  xxxg1996xxx ; translocations between
these two genes are the most common in vivo [5].
to construct the model plasmid, the bcr elements
were amplified using total human genomic dna as a
template (the regions corresponding to the fragment
39481–42211 of the genbank sequence ac104339.10
for the eto bcr and fragment 46301–49309 of the
ap000057.1 region for the aml bcr) and integrated
into the original vector. in addition, the obtained plasmids contained the gene of resistance to ampicillin and
were capable of episome replication due to the virus
sv-40 replication start. at the last stage of cloning, the
ccdb gene was integrated into the resultant plasmid
between two bcrs.
note that the final construct may contain an insignificant amount of intermediate cloning products. these
molecules are topologically connected with the molecules of final plasmids, forming catenanes. during subsequent treatment with topoisomerase, the catenanes
sometimes broke up into the final plasmid containing
the ccdb gene and the intermediate plasmid not containing it. the latter plasmid yielded a false positive
result when searching for recombinants, thereby distorting the results of the analysis of recombination frequency. therefore, we treated the plasmid with  xxxg2312xxx  under catalytic conditions in order to neutralize this undesirable effect. bacterial cells were
transformed with the reaction mixture and plated onto
media containing and not containing iptg. the bacteria formed several thousand colonies in the absence of
the inducer and no colonies in the presence of it, which
confirmed that the final construct did not contain catenanes.

illegitimate recombination in vitro may be explained
by the subunit exchange model
the next stage of our study dealt with the induction
of illegitimate recombination by  xxxg2312xxx  in
vitro. to date, two models of  xxxg2312xxx -induced
illegitimate recombination have been suggested
(fig. 1). historically, the subunit exchange model was
suggested first [6]. according to this model, each subunit of the homodimeric enzyme covalently binds only
one side of the induced double-strand break. then, subunit exchange between two dimers occurs. if these
“chimerical” molecules have finished the enzymatic
cycle, illegitimate recombination will occur. in other
words,  xxxg2312xxx  both makes dna breaks and
repairs them. according to the alternative “induction”
model [7],  xxxg2312xxx  only makes the breaks, and
another enzyme (most probably, a component of the
standard system for repairing double-strand breaks)
ligates them.
we studied how nonhomologous recombination is
affected by  xxxd3309xxx , which blocks topoisomerase at
the stage of the transitional complex, i.e., when the
cleaved dna molecule was bound with the enzyme
molecule. if the subunit exchange hypothesis were to
be correct, then the in vitro and in vivo recombination
frequencies would be approximately equal to each
other.
first, we induced illegitimate recombination in a minimal in vitro system containing only  xxxg2312xxx , its
inhibitor ( xxxd3309xxx ), and substrate (the model plasmid). to induce illegitimate recombination, 0.1 µg of

and (b) the recombination frequency on the time after transfection. the amount of recombinant dna is measured by
the number of colonies that have grown on an inducer-containing medium. recombination frequency was determined
as the ratio between the number of colonies grown in the
presence of inducer and the number of colonies grown in the
absence of inducer.

the plasmid was incubated in the presence of 200 u of
 xxxg2312xxx , as well as  xxxd2531xxx  and atp.
in a parallel experiment, the  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor
 xxxd3309xxx  ( xxxd3309xxx ) was added to the reaction mixture.
the reaction was stopped by adding edta to a concentration of 250 mm and nacl to 1 m, after which dna
was isolated and the aforementioned test for deletion
mutants was performed. we did not find products of
illegitimate recombination either in the presence or in
the absence of  xxxd3309xxx , probably, because of an
insufficient sensitivity of the system. thus, experiments
in vivo were indispensable for determining the mechanism of illegitimate recombination.

other cell systems ligated them. however, the subunit
exchange mechanism may have underlain a small proportion of recombination events.
in further experiments, we isolated the plasmid
dna 16–18 h after the transfection. then, the recombination frequency was still relatively small (about 7%)
and the amount of dna was sufficient for subsequent
manipulations (due to episome replication). under
these conditions, the inhibition of  xxxg2312xxx  by
 xxxd3309xxx  considerably increased the recombination
frequency (fig. 3). thus, illegitimate recombination is
indeed likely to be stimulated by inhibition of  xxxg2312xxx .

model construct. the plasmid dna was isolated from
eukaryotic cells by the classical method [8] with a few
modifications. the isolated dna was tested for deletion mutations as described above.
recombinant dna began to accumulate in cells as
early as 12 h after the transfection, and its amount
increased with time. the frequency of illegitimate
recombination also increased from 4 to 15% with an
increase in the time between transfection and dna isolation from 12 to 44 h (fig. 2). as can be seen from the
figure, the recombination frequency in vivo was considerably higher than in the minimal in vitro system.
apparently, most events of illegitimate recombination
in vivo are mediated by the induction mechanism, when
 xxxg2312xxx  only made double-strand breaks, and
