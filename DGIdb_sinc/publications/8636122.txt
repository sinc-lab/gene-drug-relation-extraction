the cellular effects elicited by d9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the
major psychoactive component of cannabis (1), are mediated
through cell surface cannabinoid receptors. complementary
dnas encoding rat (2) and human brain (3) receptors (cb1)1 as
well as a cdna encoding a human peripheral (4) receptor (cb2)
have been characterized. the predicted amino acid sequences
show that these receptors have structures typical of the seven
transmembrane domain g protein-coupled receptor superfamily (5). the human cb1 and cb2 share only 43% overall identity (64% similarity), rising to 51% identity (71% similarity) in
the transmembrane bundle-loop domain; this rather large
structural difference only partly correlates with agonist specificity. although d9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the classical synthetic agonists cp 55,940 and win 55212–2 were originally
reported to be nondiscriminating (4), more recent investigations by us2 and others (6, 7) have shown a significantly higher

affinity of win 55212–2 for cb2 than for cb1. the endogenous
brain and peripheral ligands, anandamide (8) and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (9), are essentially nondiscriminating (4, 6, 7, 9). in
addition to their overall similarity in respect to agonist recognition, both cb1 (10, 11) and cb2 (12) mediate their action
through the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via a pertussis toxinsensitive gtp-binding regulatory protein. cb1 has also been
shown to be associated with the inhibition of n-type calcium
channels in neuroblastoma-glioma cells (13) and q-type calcium channels in att-20 cells (7), whereas a similar activity for
cb2 could not be detected (7).
in order to determine the structural elements of receptors
necessary for ligand recognition, it is useful to dispose of ligands that are species specific or receptor subtype specific.
considering the former possibility, it is unfortunate that the
ligand binding properties of the rat cb1, whose sequence differs from human cb1 in only 13 amino acids, mainly in the
amino-terminal region, are identical to those of human cb1
(14). the only other known cb1 sequence, the murine, differs
from rat cb1 by only one amino acid in the amino-terminal
region.3 in contrast, the recently cloned murine cb2 is only
82% identical to human cb2 but has binding properties similar
to those of the human receptor.4 however, a highly specific cb1
ligand is already available. we have recently described sr
141716a (12), the first selective, potent antagonist of a cannabinoid receptor, which displays a 1000-fold higher specificity
for cb1 than for cb2. this molecule therefore provides a powerful tool for studying in vitro and in vivo functions of the
cannabinoid receptor as well as the structural features of the
cannabinoid receptors important for ligand recognition.
because of the paucity of biophysical data concerning g
protein-coupled receptors, studies of ligand-receptor interactions have relied heavily on molecular biological techniques.
since the pioneering work by the lefkowitz group (15) on the
chimeric receptors that resulted from an exchange of structurally homologous domains between the a2- and b2-adrenergic
receptors at the cdna level, this strategy has proved to be an
effective first approach for determining regions implicated in
either ligand-receptor or receptor-effector interactions. based
on the results obtained, more precise details of the interactions
follow the mutation of selected amino acids in the regions
identified. this general approach has been followed successfully in studies of receptors for peptides and biogenic amines
(see refs. 16 and 17 for recent reviews).
in the present article we describe the expression of a series of
cb1/cb2 chimeras and mutated wild-type receptors and their

the antagonist sr 141716a has a high specificity for
the central cb1 cannabinoid receptor and negligeable
affinity for the peripheral cb2 receptor, making it an
excellent tool for probing receptor structure-activity relationships. from binding experiments with mutated
cb1 and with chimeric cb1/cb2 receptors we have begun to identify the domains of cb1 implicated in the
recognition of sr 141716a. receptors were transiently
expressed in cos-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with sr 141716a and with cp 55,940,
an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors.
the region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of cb1 proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of sr 141716a. the cb1 and cb2 second
extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications
that had no effect on sr 141716a binding in the cb1
variant but that eliminated cp 55,940 binding in both
mutants. the replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of cb2 by serine also eliminated cp 55,940
binding, but replacement of those in cb1 resulted in the
sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm. the e2 domain thus plays some role in cp 55,940
binding but none in sr 141716a recognition, binding of
the latter clearly implicating residues in the adjoining
transmembrane helices.

binding properties with the antagonist sr 141716a and the
agonist cp 55,940, the latter proving useful for ensuring the
integrity of the mutated receptors. in addition, several modified receptors failed to bind ligands, and we found that the
expression of receptors fused to a c-myc epitope proved to be
indispensable for ascertaining whether this failure was a result
of nonexpression of the receptors, a consequence of poor insertion in the plasma membrane, or attributable to deleterious
conformational perturbations.

receptors. black circles represent amino acids common to the two
receptors, and white circles different amino acids. the mutated cysteines described in the present work are shown as open squares (cb1specific) or as solid squares (common to cb1 and cb2). potential asnlinked sugar residues are shown as c. the bars represent the sites of
fusion to create the chimeras.
added, the mixture was heated for 5 min at 100 °c and sonicated, and
10 ml samples separated on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 18 h at 70 v. the proteins were transferred to immobilon p
membranes (millipore s.a., st. quentin-yvelines, france), which were
saturated for 30 min with pbs with 5% bsa at 37 °c before washing
three times with pbs and 0.1% bsa. the membranes were incubated
for 18 h at 4 °c with anti-c-myc antibody (1/1000) in pbs with 0.1% bsa
and then washed three times for 30 min with pbs and 0.1% bsa.
positive bands were revealed after incubating for 2 h at 20 °c with an
anti-mouse auroprobe (1/100) (amersham corp.) in pbs, 0.1% bsa,
and 5% (v/v) gelatine, followed by washing two times for 1 min with
distilled water and then adding silver enhancer from the amersham kit.
binding on subcellular fractions—cos-3 cells transiently expressing cannabinoid receptors were treated 56 h after transfection. cells
were washed twice with pbs, scraped into 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.7,
crushed in a polytron for 1 min at 7000 rpm, and then separated into
two halves. one half was centrifuged for 60 min at 108,000 3 g, and the
pellet was resuspended in pbs (fraction 1). the second half was centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 3 g, the pellet was suspended in pbs
(fraction 2), and the supernatant was centrifuged at 108,000 3 g, the
pellet being taken up in pbs (fraction 3). protein content was measured
by the bradford method (23). the fractions were stored at 280 °c before
binding assays (12, 44).
results

binding characteristics of wild-type and chimeric receptors—using polymerase chain reaction, chimeric cdna constructions were obtained in which cb1-encoding domains were
systematically replaced by the corresponding cb2 regions,
junctions being made at the putative intra/extramembrane
interfaces, in all but one case next to an amino acid common to
the two receptors (fig. 1). membranes from transfected cos-3
cells transiently expressing the chimeras were used for binding
experiments. membranes from cos-3 cells transfected with
empty vector do not bind cannabinoids (data not shown). the
synthetic agonist cp 55,940 has been shown to have similar
binding affinities for both cb1 and cb2 (4) and was therefore
expected to be useful as a universal ligand for all chimeric
constructs. in a first series of saturation binding experiments,
the dissociation constants for [3h]cp 55,940 with each of the
expressed receptors was measured (table i). where binding
occurred, all the values were in the subnanomolar range, indicating insertion of these receptors in the membrane apparently
with little structural perturbation. from the bmax values it can
be seen that comparable numbers of each of the receptors were
to be found in the plasma membranes. the antagonist sr
141716a displaced the radioligand in a competitive manner,
revealing a clear relationship between the binding affinity of

materials—sr 141716a, cp 55,940, and anandamide were synthesized at sanofi recherche (montpellier, france). drugs were dissolved
either in ethanol (anandamide, d9-tetrahydrocannabinol) or dimethyl
sulfoxide (sr 141716a or cp 55,940), the amount of solvent in assays
never exceeding 0.1% (v/v), an amount without effect on radioligand
binding. biofluor liquid scintillant and [3h]cp 55,940 (111.9 ci/mmol)
were from new england nuclear (paris, france) and [3h]sr 141716a
(35– 40 ci/mmol) from amersham corp. (les ulis, france). the anti-cmyc mouse antibody 9e10 was a gift from b. pau (cnrs, montpellier).
human anti-mitochondrial serum was from leinco technology. a fluorescein-coupled anti-mouse antibody and a rhodamine-labeled antihuman antibody were from silenus.
site-directed mutagenesis and construction of chimeric receptors—
the cdna containing the coding region for cb1 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from the human im-9 cell line as described
(18), and that for cb2 was obtained from the human premonocytic cell
line u937. site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the sculptor
kit (amersham corp., les ulis, france). constructions were made by
overlap polymerase chain reaction extension (19). receptor fusions
were carried out at the junctions shown in fig. 1, usually following or
preceding an amino acid common to cb1 and cb2 at the extremity of a
tm region. the nomenclature used for chimeric receptors is: cb parent
receptor/replacement receptor (region replaced); for example cb1/2(6ct) is cb1 fused with the homologous tm6 to cooh-terminal cb2
sequence following trp299 of cb1. the amino acids preceding and following the points of fusion are as follows: cb1/2(1-ct), cb1(ala118)/
cb2(val 36 ); cb1/2(2-ct), cb1(his 154 )/cb2(phe 72 ); cb1/2(3-ct),
cb1(asn187)/cb2(val155); cb1/2(4-ct), cb1(lys232)/cb2(ala150); cb1/
2(5-ct), cb1(thr 274 )/cb2(tyr 190 ); cb1/2(6-ct), cb1(trp 299 )/
cb2(lys 215 ); cb1/2(7-ct), cb1(val 364 )/cb2(his 267 ); cb1/2(ct),
cb1(ser401)/cb2(gly304); cb2/1(5-ct), cb2(asp189)/cb2(tyr275). “sandwich” fusions were: cb1/2(4 –5)/1, cb1(lys232)/cb2(ala150-trp214)/
cb1(lys 300 ); cb2/1(4 –5)/2, cb2(arg 149 )/cb1(ala 233 -trp 299 )/
cb2(lys215). other modifications are described under “results.” to
express receptors having an nh2-terminal c-myc epitope, a doublestranded oligonucleotide encoding the epitope together with a kozac
consensus sequence was inserted into the hindiii site, thereby leading
to the expression of receptors carrying the supplementary 13-amino
acid nh2-terminal sequence (meqkliseedlkl) in front of the second
residue of the receptors. the dna sequences of all constructs were
confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (21). all the constructions were inserted into p658, an expression vector derived from p7055 (20) by
replacing the il-2 coding sequence with a polylinker flanked by hindiii
and ecori sites. the vectors were transfected into cos-3 cells by a
modified deae-dextran method (22).
immunofluorescence—transiently transfected cos-3 cells (1.6 3 105
cells) were incubated for 2 days in pairs of slide flasks (nunc, roskilde,
denmark). the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs), on one of the pairs of slide flasks the cells were fixed by methanol
treatment for 6 s at 220 °c and then followed by further washing with
pbs, 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx , and sodium azide. fixed and unfixed
cells were treated for 60 min at 4 °c with pbs solution containing
mouse anti-myc antibody (1/500) and human anti-mitochondrial antibody (1/1000). after washing with the same solution at 4 °c, the slides
were incubated with the labeled anti-antibodies (each at 1/100). after
further washing the slide bearing the fixed cells was dried with filter
paper, and the cells on the second slide were methanol-fixed and dried.
the doubly labeled cells were examined using a leitz  xxxd2511xxx  20 phase
contrast microscope.
western blot analysis—western blot analysis of total cell proteins
was carried out. transiently transfected cos-3 cells (1.6 3 105 cells)
were incubated for 2 days in 10-cm wells and then scraped into 100 ml
of pbs. after centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 rpm, the pellet was
resuspended in 30 ml of 125 mm tris ph 7.4, 4% sds, and 20% glycerol
containing bromphenol blue. an equal volume of 8% dithiothreitol was

anti-myc antibodies both before and after fixation on slide
flasks. at the same time, the cells were incubated with a
rhodamine-labeled anti-mitochondrial antibody as a control of
cell integrity. panels a and b of fig. 4 show the detection on
intact cells of tagged cb1 and cb2, respectively. a uniform
pattern of distribution of the receptors over the entire plasma
membrane surface can be observed. the insets in fig. 4 (a and
b) show that mitochondria were not detectable, indicating that
the cells were intact. in contrast, fig. 4c shows the immunofluorescence observed with cb1/2(6-ct). the inset (fig. 4c)
shows that no immunofluorescence was observed in intact cells,
whereas it can be seen that the c-myc epitope could be easily
detected in fixed cells, indicating sequestration of the chimera
in the interior of the cells. fig. 4d shows the result of incubation of the same, fixed cells with the antimitochondrial antibody. however, if cb1/2(6-ct) was present in the interior of the
cell, was it nevertheless capable of recognizing the universal
ligand cp 55,940? whole cell fractions were compared with the
membrane fractions and the nonmembrane fractions for binding experiments, wild-type c-myc-cb1 being used as a control.
specific binding of tritiated cp 55,940 was 73, 74, and 68% for
the three fractions of wild-type cb1, respectively. in contrast,
no specific binding to cb1/2(6-ct) was observed, radioactivity
being indistinguishable from background levels for each fraction.

replacement of the cooh-terminal tail of cb1 by that of
cb2 in the cb1/2(ct) chimera resulted in a 2-fold increase in
antagonist affinity (table i). the subsequent replacement of
the cb1 tm7 region by that of cb2, giving cb1/2(7-ct), resulted in a 4-fold loss in sr 141716a affinity compared with the
wild-type receptor. this loss in affinity suggests some slight
perturbation in receptor structure rather than a direct effect on
the ligand binding site. no ligand binding was obtained with
the chimeric receptor cb1/2(6-ct). this chimera was reconstructed with a c-myc epitope inserted between met1 and lys2,
and its characteristics compared with those of epitope-tagged
wild-type cb1 and cb2. the epitope proved to have relatively
little effect on cp 55,940 binding (kd 0.63 6 0.29 nm, bmax 2.5
6 0.6 pmol/mg of protein for cb1; kd 0.24 6 0.05 nm, bmax 12.7
6 1.0 pmol/mg of protein for cb2) compared with that of the
wild-type receptors (see table i), in line with previous findings
with amino-terminally tagged receptors (24, 25). western immunoblot analysis of the tagged receptors using a labeled antimyc antibody confirmed the expression of cb1 (lane 5, fig. 3a)
and cb2 (lanes 1 and 2, fig. 3b) as well as of cb1/2(6-ct) (lane 4,
fig. 3a).
the question then arose as to whether or not the latter
protein was present in the plasma membrane. we carried out
microscopical immunofluorescence examination of transfected
cos cells after incubating the cells with fluorescein-labeled

tition by sr 141716a for the binding site. compared with
cb1/2(7-ct), the addition of a further two cb2 transmembrane
regions only resulted in a 2-fold drop in affinity for sr
141716a, which represented a relatively small loss. in contrast, a more spectacular loss in affinity for sr 141716a was
observed with cb1/2(4-ct), the replacement of tm4 and e2 of
cb1 by that of cb2 resulting in an 18-fold drop in the ic50
value, thereby practically attaining that of wild-type cb2. no
further significant changes in binding affinity for sr 141716a
occurred on incorporating further amino-terminal regions of
cb2 into the chimeras. it must be noted that two other chimeras in the series, cb1/2(3-ct) and cb1/2(2-ct), failed to bind
cp 55,940.
results from the direct binding of [3h]sr 141716a to the
wild-type and chimeric receptors correlated with the competition studies, because this ligand recognized only wild-type cb1,
cb1/2(ct), and cb1/2(7-ct) the binding affinities of the ligand
with each of these receptors were 0.38, 0.41, and 1.0 nm, respectively, in line with the ic50 values (table i). the binding of
sr 141716a with cb1/2(5-ct) was too poor to allow its direct
binding affinity to be measured with any degree of accuracy.
we also constructed the chimeric receptor reciprocal to cb1/
2(5-ct), namely cb2/1(5-ct), containing the cb2 sequence up
to and including tm4 and e2, the remaining sequence being
that of cb1 (table i). this had a binding affinity for sr
141716a similar to that of cb1/2(5-ct), suggesting that structural elements in the tm4 and  xxxg2318xxx  regions and/or in the e2
loop of cb1 might be implicated in the binding of the antagonist. to investigate this further, we constructed sandwich chimeras in which the tm4-e2- xxxg2318xxx  regions of the two receptors
were interchanged (fig. 5). [3h]cp 55,940 bound with high
affinity to the cb1/2(4 –5)/1 sandwich, whereas as predictable
from the preceding experiments, sr 141716a completely failed
to compete for its binding site. in addition, tritiated sr
141716a failed to bind to this receptor, providing a further
indication that particular amino acids in the tm4-e2- xxxg2318xxx 
might indeed be implicated in binding this ligand. neither cp

investigations into the role of e2 loop residues in ligand
binding—having found that sr 141716a apparently recognized residues in the tm4-e2- xxxg2318xxx  region, we first focused on
the role of the e2 loop. replacement of the entire e2 loop of cb2
between the conserved g(w/y)l residues (fig. 5) by the cb1 e2
loop (cb2/1(e2)) resulted in a total loss of ligand binding. immunoblot analysis (lane 5, fig. 3b) confirmed, however, that
the protein was indeed expressed, and furthermore immunofluorescence analysis showed the receptors to be present in the
plasma membrane. in contrast, the  xxxg479xxx  containing
the cb2 e2 loop (cb1/2(e2), fig. 5) was expressed (lane 3, fig.
3b) and recognized tritiated sr 141716a with the same affinity
as wild-type cb1 (kd 0.44 6 0.2 nm, bmax 3.5 6 0.7 pmol/mg
protein). this receptor, however, completely failed to bind cp
55,940. we then restricted the exchange in the e2 loop to the
gap region between the conserved cys residues (fig. 5b), replacing eklqsv in cb1 by cprp (cb1(cprpe2)). this mutation and foreshortening of the cb1 e2 region resulted in the
sequestration of the receptor and thereby loss of binding, but
positive immunoblots confirmed receptor expression (lane 10,
fig. 3a; lane 6, fig. 3b).
we next turned our attention to the conserved extracellular
cys residues, because some evidence exists for the implication
of cys in ligand binding or disulfide bridge formation (26, 27).
the mutation to serine of either of the two cysteines in e2 of
cb1, c257s, and c264s, resulted in a complete loss of binding
of ligands to isolated cos-3 membranes. here again, the lack
of binding was entirely attributable to the absence of the mu-

discussion

sr 141716a is a highly selective antagonist for the central
cannabinoid receptor cb1 (12, 30). this ligand is the only one
to date that can readily differentiate between cb1 and cb2,
which share only 51% identity in their central, transmembrane
loop regions. as a first step in the identification of the amino
acid residues in cb1 implicated in sr 141716a recognition, we
have undertaken the construction of a series of chimeric receptors with the aim of determining the regions of cb1 essential
for the binding of the antagonist. the large drop in affinity for

sr 141716a on replacing the tm4-e2 amino acids of cb1/2(5ct) by the corresponding cb2 residues was particularly striking, strongly suggesting that this region of cb1 contains structural features important for the high affinity binding of the
antagonist. however, the same binding affinity was found for
the mirror image receptor cb2/1(5-ct), which pointed at the
same time to the presence of residues important for sr
141716a binding in  xxxg2318xxx .
the importance of the tm4 to  xxxg2318xxx  region was confirmed by
the finding that the cb1 sandwich containing this particular
region of cb2 bound cp 55,940 normally but showed no affinity
for sr 141716a. this chimeric receptor was of particular interest because it provided a starting point for mutational studies aimed at recovering the high affinity binding site for the
antagonist and hence identifying critical amino acids. it is clear
that despite the considerable difference in primary structure
between cb1 and cb2, the overall architecture of the wild-type
and chimeric receptors must be well retained in those receptors
binding cp 55,940. a three-dimensional theoretical model of
cb1 has recently been proposed (31), based on a seven-transmembrane helix bundle arrangement in rhodopsin (32), derived from a low resolution electron cryomicroscopic analysis of
this g protein-coupled receptor (33). using this model for ligand-receptor docking studies, bramblett and reggio (45) have
hypothesized a three-point interaction site for cp 55,940 and
other agonists with cb1 with residues in  xxxg2318xxx ,  xxxg2318xxx , and tm6.
this conforms with the most widely accepted model for agonist
binding in the g protein-coupled receptor family (reviewed in
ref. 16). the postulated residues are lys192 in  xxxg2318xxx , tyr275 in
 xxxg2318xxx , with val350 and ile354 in tm6, all residues found in
equivalent positions in cb2. if this hypothesis is correct, because the same high affinity binding of cp 55,940 has been
found for the receptors studied here, these noncontiguous
amino acids are most probably identically oriented in all the
chimeric receptors as well as in wild-type cb1 and cb2. sr
141716a, a  xxxd3045xxx  derivative, is structurally dissimilar to cp
55,940 and the other cannabinoids and therefore probably
binds to quite different amino acids in cb1. nevertheless, some
of the amino acids involved in sr 141716a binding to cb1 but
perhaps not all may also be those conserved in cb2. because
the transmembrane bundles are correctly orientated for cp
55,940 binding in all of the receptors, except those modified in
e2 (see below), the evidence points away from the fact that the
specificity for sr 141716a for cb1 may be merely attributable
to slightly different orientations of amino acids conserved in

tated receptors at the cell surface, because although immunoblotting confirmed their expression (lanes 7 and 8, fig. 3a),
immunofluorescence was detectable only in permeabilized cells
(not shown). not surprisingly, a similar loss in binding was
observed for the double cb1 mutant c257,264s, although here
again immunoblot analysis confirmed its expression (lane 9,
fig. 3a), and immunofluorescence confirmed its sequestration
in the interior of the cells (not shown). it was recently shown by
the khorana group (28) that replacement of cysteine by alanine
resulted in a mutant rhodopsin receptor that had a greater
resemblance to the native form than that resulting from a
serine replacement (29). however, the cb1 mutants c257a
and c264a, although expressed, failed to bind cp 55,940. we
investigated the possibility that replacement of the e2 cys
residues had resulted in the elimination of a crucial putative
disulfide bridge formed with one of the only two other extracellularly located cys, situated in the nh2-terminal extremity.
the double mutant c98,107s was well expressed (lane 6, fig.
3a) and bound both cp 55,940 (kd 0.2 6 0.05 nm, bmax 5.3 6 0.6
pmol/mg protein) and sr 141716a (kd 0.3 6 0.08 and bmax 9.3
6 1.0 pmol/mg protein), showing that these residues are not
implicated in ligand binding and that a disulfide bridge between the nh2-terminal region and an e2 cys is either not
present in cb1 or is not crucial for ligand binding.
human cb2 has three cysteines in e2, two of which, cys174
and cys179, correspond to the positions of those in cb1 (figs. 1
and 5b). each of these was independently mutated to serine in
an amino-terminal c-myc-cb2 fusion receptor. as observed
with the corresponding cb1 mutants, although western immunoblot confirmed a normal expression of the mutated receptors
(lanes 4 and 7, fig. 3b), ligand binding was completely eliminated. however, in contrast to the cb1 mutants, immunofluorescence on intact cells was positive (not shown), indicating a
profound modification of the cp 55,940 binding site. we have
not mutated either cys4 or cys180.

binding of sr 141716a to the  xxxg479xxx 
ing with sr 141716a have to be sought within both of the
transmembrane helices adjoining e2. extensive mutagenesis
studies will be necessary before we can identify specific sr
141716a-recognizing amino acids in this particular part of the
 xxxg479xxx .

both cb1 and cb2. but as a caveat it must be noted that the
species selectivity for  xxxg2240xxx  antagonists was indeed attributable to relatively minor local conformational perturbations between species (34).
the tm4-e2- xxxg2318xxx  region is the internal domain that contains
the lowest identity (35%) between cb1 and cb2, and because
the e2 loops of cb1 and cb2 differ both in size and primary
sequence, we first investigated their possible participation in
ligand binding. in general, although extracellular loop residues
are principally involved in peptide ligand recognition (see ref.
16 for a recent review), they can contribute to antagonist binding, as found for the  xxxg2240xxx  (35, 36), k opioid (37), and
adenosine (38) receptors. unfortunately, our investigation was
severely hampered by the fact that several of the modifications
made to this part of the cb receptors resulted in sequestration
of the proteins in the interior of the transfected cells, which also
occurred with three of the cb1/cb2 chimeric constructs. this
particular problem is often encountered with mutated g protein-coupled receptors and chimeric constructs (39 – 42); for
example, confocal microscopic examination of a nontranslocated, mutated, tagged b2-adrenergic receptor showed it to be
trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (40). its sequestration
was assumed to be a result of steric incompatibility, leading to
misfolding, because compensatory mutation subsequently rescued the receptor and allowed it to be successfully translocated
(40). cellular extracts of the cb1/2(6-ct) chimeric receptor
failed to bind cp 55,940, whereas in the same experiment,
cellular extracts of wild-type cb1 correctly bound the agonist.
because the chimeric receptor, although present, does not bind
the ligand, this would indicate that the chimera contains incompatible structural features that impede correct folding in
the interior of the cell and would suggest, furthermore, that
only a correctly folded receptor is able to translocate. it is well
documented that the degradation of misfolded, endoplasmic
reticulum-bound proteins can be very slow (43), and in support
of this report is our observation that our western immunoblot
analyses showed little evidence of degradation of these trapped
proteins.
we were particularly interested in the cysteine residues in
e2, because they are a characterizing feature of the cannabinoid receptors and have been suggested to be implicated in
receptor tertiary structure or directly in ligand binding (26, 27).
unfortunately, among the proteins that failed to reach the
plasma membrane were the cb1 variants in which the e2
cysteines had been mutated singly or doubly. on the other
hand, the two cys situated in the amino-terminal of cb1 do not
appear to play an important role in its function, because their
replacement had no effect on ligand binding. unlike the cb1
mutants, the cys174 3 ser and cys179 3 ser mutants of cb2
were successfully translocated to the plasma membrane. however, they failed to bind cp 55,940. the other e2 modifications
that resulted in successful receptor translocation were those in
which the entire loops were interchanged. the effect of these
changes on ligand binding was contrasting. cb2 containing the
e2 of cb1 failed to bind either cp 55,940 (or, predictably, sr
141716a), although immunofluorescence analysis showed the
receptor to be present at the cell surface. similarly, in cb1
containing the e2 of cb2, the cp 55,940 binding site was again
lost, but sr 141716a bound as well as to the wild-type receptor.
several possibilities arise from these results: i) the cys may
directly participate in binding cp 55,940; ii) the cys may play
an essential role in correctly orientating the cp 55,940 binding
site; iii) modifications to the e2 region may disorient the neighboring tyr275, if indeed this residue is implicated in cp 55,940
binding (45); iv) e2 residues in cb1 are unimportant for the
binding of sr 141716a; and v) amino acid side chains interact-
