1 experiments were performed to examine the effects of anti-fungal imidazole compounds ( xxxd1732xxx , econazole and  xxxd2640xxx ) on the induction of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) synthase and subsequent
production of no in the cultured murine monocyte/macrophage cell line j774 using a specific cdna
probe for  xxxg1578xxx  mrna and by monitoring nitrite production.
2 stimulation of j774 cells with lipopolysaccharide (lps, 10 jg ml-') resulted in the induction of no
synthase activity as determined by nitrite accumulation in the culture medium (48 ± 3 nmol per 106 cells
over 24 h). production of nitrite was inhibited by co-incubation of cells with lps (10 gg ml- ') and either
dexamethasone ( xxxd1955xxx ) or  xxxd3291xxx  ( xxxd3291xxx ; 0.1 mm), however, only  xxxd3291xxx 
was an effective inhibitor of nitrite production when added after induction of no synthase had
occurred.
3 co-incubation of j774 cells with lps (10ygml-') and either  xxxd1732xxx , econazole or  xxxd2640xxx 
(1-10 gm) resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of nitrite production over the subsequent
24 h without any evidence for a cytotoxic effect. however, addition of these imidazoles after induction
of no synthase did not inhibit nitrite production.
4 messenger rna for  xxxg1578xxx  was not detected in unstimulated j774 cells. treatment
with lps (10 g ml-') for 4 h resulted in significant expression of mrna for  xxxg1578xxx 
which was not altered in the presence of econazole (10 im) but was reduced significantly by dexamethasone (10 ilm).
5
these results demonstrate that anti-fungal imidazoles inhibit the production of  xxxd2738xxx  by
cultured j774 cells by a mechanism which appears to differ from that of dexamethasone and substratetype inhibitors of no synthase. furthermore, the presence of mrna for no synthase does not indicate
the presence of functionally active no synthase.

introduction
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) is a potent and widespread signalling
molecule within the cardiovascular, nervous and immune
systems (moncada et al., 1991). in certain tissues, including
endothelium and brain, synthesis of no from l-arginine is
catalyzed by the action of a constitutively expressed ca2"/
calmodulin-dependent no synthase (palmer & moncada,
1989; mayer et al., 1989; bredt & snyder, 1990). the no
produced activates  xxxg1587xxx  in target cells. however,
in endothelium and many other cells that do not normally
synthesize no (including macrophages), exposure to bacterial
endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, lps) and/or cytokines, results
in expression of a distinct isoform of no synthase which is
often functionally ca2+/calmodulin-insensitive and makes
large amounts of no (moncada et al., 1991). in the quantities produced by the inducible enzyme no is toxic to
invading pathogens (hibbs et al., 1987; marletta et al., 1988)
and certain host cells (palmer et al., 1992). the two broad
groups of no synthase share certain similarities. one common feature is that they are haemoproteins with homology to
cytochrome p450 reductase and possess both oxidase and
reductase domains (bredt et al., 1991; white & marletta,
1992).
inhibition of no synthesis can be achieved in a number of
ways. substrate-based analogues of l-arginine including ngmonomethyl-l-arginine ( xxxd3291xxx ) and ng-nitro-l-arginine
(l-noarg) compete with l-arginine for metabolism to no
and inhibit the activity of constitutive and inducible enzymes
(moore et al., 1990; rees et al., 1989; 1990). alternatively,

the expression of the inducible enzyme may be inhibited by
glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone and hydrocortisone; di
rosa et al., 1990; radomski et al., 1990) which probably act
by inhibiting gene expression or the transcription of inducible
no synthase messenger rna (mrna). in addition, by
inhibiting protein synthesis (radomski et al., 1990) or production of essential co-factors such as tetrahydrobiopterin
(gross & levi, 1992), induction of no synthesis can be
inhibited. recently it has been reported that anti-fungal
imidazoles inhibit the activity of constitutive no synthase
through an effect on ca2+/calmodulin (wolff et al., 1993a).
however, these compounds also inhibit the activity of mammalian cytochrome p450 proteins (rodrigues et al., 1987) by
binding to the haem domain. if this interaction also occurred
with no synthase, anti-fungal imidazoles would be expected
to inhibit the activity of the ca2+/calmodulin-insensitive and
sensitive isoforms. in the present study we have examined the
effects of anti-fungal imidazoles on  xxxg1578xxx  in
the murine macrophage cell line j774 and have sought to
identify the mechanism of action of inhibition.

methods

cell culture
cells of the murine monocyte/macrophage line j774 were
maintained in continuous culture in tissue-culture flasks
(75 cm2 growth area) in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium
supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine,
penicillin (100 units ml-') and streptomycin (100 pig ml-').

r.g. bogle et al.

cells were harvested by gentle scraping and passaged every
3-6 days by dilution of a suspension of the cells 1:10 in
fresh medium.

measurement of nitrite production as an assay of no
release
production of no was assayed by measuring the accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium by the griess reaction
(green et al., 1982; bogle et al., 1992). j774 cells were seeded
into 96-well microtitre plates (105 cells per well) and allowed
to adhere for 2 h at 370c following which the medium was
removed and replaced with fresh medium containing lipopolysaccharide (lps, 10 gg ml-') and either ngmonomethyll-argibine ( xxxd3291xxx ; 0.1 or 1 mm), dexamethasone (1 or
1o sm) or imidazole compounds (1-10i m). in some experiments, cells were pre-activated with lps (10 pg ml-') for
24 h following which the lps was removed and cells treated
with fresh medium containing either  xxxd3291xxx , dexamethasone or anti-fungal imidazoles. twenty-four hours later an
aliquot (100 1g) of the culture medium was removed, mixed
with an equal volume of griess reagent (final concentration:
sulphanilamide 1% w/v, napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride 0.1% w/v and orthophosphoric acid 2.5% v/v) and
incubated at room temperature for 10 min. the absorbance
was read at 560 nm in a titertek multiskan ii plate reader
(flow, high wycombe, u.k.). nitrite concentration in the
medium was determined using sodium nitrite as a standard.

assays of cell viability
cell viability was measured either by the ability of the cells to
exclude the vital stain trypan blue (0.4% w/v in dulbecco's
phosphate buffered saline of composition, mm: nacl 138,
kci 2.6, na2po4 8.1, kh2po4 1.5, ph 7.4) as determined by
visual microscopy or by assessment of the ability of the cells
to convert 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl) tetrazolium bromide; mtt; 0.5 mg ml-') into formazan over a
4 h time period according to the method of mosmann (1983).

production of cdna probe for inducible macrophage
no synthase
j774 cells (106 cells) were treated with lps (10 glg ml-') for
6 h and poly(a)+-selected mrna was isolated with a fasttrack mrna isolation kit according to the manufacturer's

instructions (invitrogen, san diego, u.s.a.). the mrna
obtained was used for the synthesis of first strand cdna
using random primers with a commercial kit (first strand,
pharmacia, milton keynes, u.k.). the cdna was then used
as a template in a polymerase chain reaction (conditions: 25
cycles of denaturing, 95°c, 1 min; annealing 65c, 2 min and
polymerization 72°c, 1 min), utilizing oligonucleotide primers
designed from the published sequence of murine macrophage
 xxxg1578xxx  (primer 1: base pairs 2476-2498
(sense), primer 2: base pairs 2969-2947 (antisense); lyons et
al., 1992). the derived product was purified by electrophoresis on a low-melting point agarose gel (1% w/v) and
subcloned into a plasmid vector (ecorv linearized dephosphorylated pbluescript ii, stratagene ltd, cambridge, u.k.).
subsequently the plasmid was transfected into competent
bacteria (xl blue-l e. coli, stratagene) and plasmid dna
prepared from bacterial cultures. the identity of the insert
was confirmed by double stranded dideoxy sequencing with a
kit (pharmacia). a 493 base pair fragment was isolated by
restriction enzyme digestion (bamhi/hindiii, northumbria
biologicals, northumberland, u.k.) and used as a probe in
northern blotting.

total rna isolation and analysis
j774 cells (106 cells in 3 cm2 wells) were stimulated for 4 h
with either medium alone, or medium plus lps (10 g ml-')
or lps in the presence of either econazole (10 pm) or dexamethasone (10 p4m). total rna was extracted using rnazol
reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (biogenesis ltd, bournemouth, u.k.). the rna samples (10 g
quantified from the od260) were electrophoresed on a
formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred using 20 x sspe
buffer ( xxxd3213xxx  3.6 m, sodium phosphate 0.2 m,
ph 7.7; disodium edta 0.002 m) onto a nylon membrane
(hybond n +, amersham, bucks, u.k.) and fixed by
exposure to u.v. radiation. the cdna probe for inducible
no synthase was labelled with [x32p]-dctp (3000 ci mmol-',
icn flow, high wycombe, u.k.) using a multiprime dna
labelling system (amersham) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. pre-hybridization was performed as follows,
nylon membranes were incubated at 42°c for 1 h with
s x sspe, formamide (50% v/v), 5 x denhardt's solution
(bovine  xxxg124xxx  0. 1% w/v,  xxxd3253xxx  0. 1% w/v and
polyvinyl pyrollidone 0.1% (w/v) and  xxxd3215xxx  (sds; 0.5% w/v) supplemented with 20 pg ml-'
denatured herring sperm dna) (promega, southampton,
u.k.). following this, membranes were incubated with the
32p-labelled no synthase probe for 18 h at 42°c in the above
buffer minus herring sperm dna. buffer was removed and
membranes washed twice with 50 ml of 2 x sspe/0. 1% sds
for 15 min at 42°c, then with 50 ml 1 x sspe/0. 1% sds for
30 min at 65°c. finally, a high stringency wash was performed with 0.1% sspe/0.1% sds for 15 min at 65°c. the
membranes were then sealed in plastic wrap and autoradiographed at - 70°c using an intensifying screen (dupont ltd,
herts, u.k.). as a control for consistency of loading,
ribosomal rna (18s) was quantified by ethidium bromide
fluorescence and photography of the formaldehyde-agarose
gel before transfer and quantitation by northern blot
analysis.

materials
all reagents for tissue culture were obtained from either
sigma (poole, u.k.) or flow (high wycombe, bucks). lps,
phenol-extracted from escherichia coli (serotype 055: b5),
 xxxd1732xxx , econazole nitrate,  xxxd2640xxx  nitrate and dexamethasone were obtained from sigma. imidazoles were dissolved to a stock concentration of 2 mm in 100% ethanol
(final concentration 0.05-0.5%). n0-monomethyl-l-arginine
acetate was a gift from dr s. moncada, wellcome research
laboratories, beckenham, kent, u.k.

data analysis and statistics
results are shown as the mean ± s.e.mean of n experiments.
statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of
variance with p< 0.05 considered statistically significant. the
density of bands on northern blots and 18s ribosomal rna
bands were quantified with a scanner attached to a computer
with image analysis software.

results
in unstimulated j774 cells, nitrite production over a 24 h
period was below the level of detection using the griess
reagent (n = 6). stimulation of cells with lipopolysaccharaide
(lps; 10 pgml1') resulted in significant nitrite production
(43 ± 3 nmol per 106 cells over 24 h, n = 6) which was
inhibited by co-incubation with either  xxxd3291xxx  (0.1 or
1 mm) or dexamethasone (1 or 1o gm; figure la). when
these agents were added to cells pre-stimulated with lps

discussion
the data presented in this study demonstrate that anti-fungal
imidazoles inhibit the induction of nitrite synthesis in macrophages. in concentrations similar to those achieved therapeutically (e.g. 2 gm for  xxxd2640xxx ; benson & nahata,
1988),  xxxd1732xxx , econazole and  xxxd2640xxx  inhibited nitrite production by j774 cells if added to the cells at the same
time as the lps but were ineffective in cells pre-stimulated
with lps. this profile of action is similar to that of glucocorticoids and might suggest that anti-fungal imidazoles inhibit
induction of no synthase gene expression. however, whereas
treatment of j774 cells with dexamethasone resulted in
inhibition of mrna for  xxxg1578xxx  and inhibition of nitrite production, econazole inhibited nitrite production without affecting mrna levels. these results demonstrate that anti-fungal imidazoles and glucocorticoids inhibit
induction of no synthase activity by different mechanisms.
glucocorticoids appear to inhibit the production of no
before or at the level of transcription while anti-fungal
imidazoles inhibit at a stage after mrna production.

a recent report indicates that anti-fungal imidazoles inhibit
the activity of the constitutive no synthase and this appears
to be due to binding and inactivation of the ca2+/calmodulin
complex (ic5o <10em, wolff et al., 1993a,b), although at
higher concentrations (mm), these drugs may also directly
inactivate constitutive no synthase by interacting with its
haem moeity (wolff et al., 1993b). in the present study,
anti-fungal imidazoles inhibited the activity of the inducible
no synthase if given at the same time as the stimulus for
enzyme induction (lps) but were ineffective when given after
the enzyme was induced. these results are unlikely to be due
to a cytotoxic effect of the compounds since this would be
expected to be similar whether the drugs were added before
or after induction of no synthase. more importantly, assays
of cell viability showed no adverse effects of imidazoles over
the concentration-range studied. the failure of anti-fungal
imidazoles to inhibit enzymic activity of the expressed  xxxg1578xxx  is not unexpected since this enzyme type is
functionally ca2+/calmodulin-independent although it is
known to bind the ca2+/calmodulin complex tightly (cho et
al., 1992). similarly, although imidazoles are reported to
inactivate the haem-moiety of enzymes this only occurs at
concentrations 50-100 fold higher than those used in the
present study (wolff et al., 1993a,b).
one possible mechanism of action is that imidazoles inhibit
the translation of the  xxxg1578xxx  mrna into no
synthase enzyme. interaction of imidazoles with the haem
moiety of no synthase at a vital stage of protein assembly
might prevent dimerization of the enzyme which is necessary
for functional activity (baek et al., 1993). alternatively, it is
known that anti-fungal imidazoles bind ca2+/calmodulin
(hegeman et al., 1993) and thereby through this mechanism
could prevent the incorporation of this complex into the no
synthase enzyme. calcium itself appears to be less important
in the induction of no synthase activity; although ca2+channel antagonists such as nifedipine inhibit induction of
no synthase in j774 cells (szabo et al., 1993), other ca2+channel antagonists such as verapamil and diltiazem do not
(hauschildt et al., 1990; szabo et al., 1993). further
experiments will be required to determine the precise
mechanism by which anti-fungal imidazoles inhibit the induction of no synthase activity in j774 cells.
the results of this study demonstrate that anti-fungal
imidazoles inhibit the induction of functionally active no
synthase in j774 cells through a mechanism that differs from
other known inhibitors of induction including glucocorticoids
and  xxxd1800xxx  which are likely to act via inhibition of
gene expression and transcription respectively. the results
obtained with anti-fungal imidazoles give some insight into
the process of induction of no synthase activity and coupled
with previous reports suggest that ca2+/calmodulin may play
an important role in regulating the activity of the inducible
isoform of no synthase. furthermore our results indicate
that it is possible to produce levels of mrna for inducible
no synthase without production of no. this finding has
implications for studies in which the level of no synthase
mrna are taken as an indication of functional activity. it
remains to be determined how our study, and other studies
demonstrating that imidazoles inhibit the activity of the constitutive no synthase (wolff et al., 1993a) contribute to the
reported anti-inflammatory (petri et al., 1986) and hypertensive effects of these and other imidazole drugs.
