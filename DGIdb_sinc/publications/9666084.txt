abstract
previous studies have demonstrated that multiple methamphetamine žmeth. administrations rapidly and reversibly decrease
 xxxg2149xxx  activity assessed in striatal synaptosomes. a role for reactive oxygen species was suggested by findings that: ž1.
meth treatment increases the formation of oxygen radicals in vivo; and ž2. oxygen radicals, generated by the enzyme  xxxg2431xxx ,
attenuate dopamine uptake in vitro. to test the selectivity of transporter responses, the present study examined effects of meth and  xxxg2431xxx  on w3 hxserotonin žw3 hx5ht. and w3 hxglutamate transport into striatal synaptosomes.
multiple doses of meth, or incubation with  xxxg2431xxx , rapidly attenuated w3 hx5ht transport; an effect attributable to a decrease
in vmax . the meth-induced decrease in transport activity completely recovered by 24 h, but was decreased again 1 week later. in
contrast, w3 hxglutamate transport was essentially unchanged after meth treatment or incubation with  xxxg2431xxx . these findings
indicate that: ž1. meth causes a rapid and reversible decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  activity; and ž2. glutamate transporters are less
susceptible than 5ht transporters to effects of reactive species or meth treatment. q 1998 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
abuse of high doses of methamphetamine žmeth. is a
serious problem in the united states. in 1996, the national
institute on drug abuse reported a 60% increase of meth
abuse among 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders. in fact, the
number of hospital emergency room visits related to meth
overdose more than tripled between 1991 and 1994 w21x.
consequently, it is important to elucidate the neurochemical effects of meth.
it is well established that multiple doses of meth
dramatically increase extracellular concentrations of biogenic monoamines such as dopamine and serotonin ž5-hydroxytryptamine; 5ht., with significant behavioral and
neurochemical consequences. these neurotransmitters can,
in turn, give rise to cytotoxic quinones and reactive oxygen
species such as  xxxd2298xxx , superoxide or hydroxyl
radicals w5,10,24x. such reactive species affect important
neuronal functions. relevant to the present studies is the

recent observation that oxygen radicals, generated in vitro,
decrease  xxxg2149xxx  function w2,6,18x.
because meth treatment promotes the formation of
oxygen radicals w8,9,14x and oxygen radicals inhibit
dopamine uptake, it is possible that meth administration
inhibits dopamine uptake by an oxidative mechanism. in
support of this hypothesis, we reported recently that both a
single and multiple administrations of meth decrease
synaptosomal w3 hxdopamine uptake 1 h after treatment.
the meth-induced rapid reductions in dopamine transport were reversible, as evidenced by recovery of dopamine
transporter activity 24 h after treatment w7x.
the  xxxg2149xxx  is not the only neuronal
protein purportedly affected by meth-induced reactive
oxygen species. the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase,
the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of 5ht, is decreased as an oxidative consequence of meth administration w8,20x. the suggestion that these two proteins may be
altered by meth-induced reactive species allows for the
possibility that other proteins, including other aminergic
transporters, might likewise be affected. hence, we examined the response of other transporter proteins to meth

treatment. in the present studies we assessed the response
of the 5ht transporters, which, like dopamine carrier
proteins, belong to the naqrcly-dependent transporter
subfamily w4x. for comparison, we also examined the
response of w3 hxglutamate transporters which belong to the
naqrkq-dependent subfamily and are distinct from
monoamine carrier proteins w15x. the findings from these
studies demonstrated that both reactive species and multiple administrations of meth rapidly decreased 5ht transport. furthermore, the meth-induced decrease in 5ht
transport was reversible. finally, glutamate transporters
were less susceptible than 5ht transporters to effects of
reactive species or meth. the significance of these findings are discussed.

described by boja et al. w3x. fresh striatal tissue was
homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m phosphate-buffered sucrose and centrifuged ž800 = g for 12 min at 48c.. the
resulting supernatant žs1. was then centrifuged ž22,000 = g
for 10 min at 48c., and the resulting pellets žp2. resuspended in ice-cold 0.32 m phosphate-buffered sucrose. in
 xxxg2431xxx  experiments, 30 mu of this enzyme were
incubated with s1 for 5 min at 378c prior to the second

3.1. effects of  xxxg2431xxx  on [3h]5ht and
[3h]glutamate uptake

meth concentrations were determined by gas chromatographyrmass spectroscopy as described previously
w8x. meth levels were measured with a finnigan 4500
mat mass spectrometer operating in positive chemical
ionization mode žmethanerammonia reagent gas. coupled
to a db5ms-30m-0.25 m capillary column. ions monitored were 263 mrz and 271 mrz for meth and methd8 žthe internal standard., respectively. the limit of quantitation in these experiments was 10 ngrml. meth levels
were determined in the p2 synaptosomal preparations, and
reported concentrations were calculated per 1 ml assay

to determine the direct effects of ros on 5ht and
glutamate transporter proteins, striatal synaptosomes were
preincubated in the presence of the oxygen radical-producing enzyme,  xxxg2431xxx . for comparison, effects on
 xxxg2149xxx  activity were assessed. fig. 1 demonstrates that preincubation with  xxxg2431xxx  decreased
w3 hx5ht uptake into synaptosomes by 40%. as reported
previously w6x,  xxxg2431xxx  treatment decreased
w3 hxdopamine uptake as well ži.e., by 76%.. in contrast,
w3 hxglutamate transport into synaptosomes obtained from
the same striatal tissue pool was unaffected by co-incuba-

tion with  xxxg2431xxx  žfig. 1.. these results demonstrate that 5ht, like dopamine transporters, are susceptible
to oxidative inactivation. further, these data indicate that
5ht and dopamine transporters are more susceptible to
oxidative inactivation than glutamate transporters.
3.2. effects of multiple administrations of meth on
[3h]glutamate and [3h]5ht uptake
because meth causes oxygen radical formation
w8,9,14x, and oxygen radicals differentially affected transporter activity žfig. 1., effects of meth administration ž4
injections of 10 mgrkg, 2-h intervals. on 5ht and glutamate transporter activity were assessed. for comparison,
effects of meth on w3 hxdopamine uptake were determined. results depicted in fig. 2a demonstrate that multiple administrations of meth were without effect on
w3 hxglutamate uptake in synaptosomes prepared 1 h after
the final drug administration. multiple administrations of
meth decreased w3 hxdopamine uptake in synaptosomes
obtained from the same synaptosomal preparation žfig.
2b.. a dissociation between the effects of meth was also
observed in synaptosomes prepared 1 week after the final
injection: meth decreased w3 hxdopamine, but not
w3 hxglutamate, uptake žfig. 2.. in separate experiments, it
was determined that the decrease in w3 hxdopamine uptake
observed 1 h after meth treatment was attributable to a
decreased vmax , rather than increased k m . these data
parallel previously reported results indicating that a single
high dose of meth lowers vmax of w3 hxdopamine uptake
but does not affect k m w7x. in contrast, neither the vmax
nor the k m of w3 hxglutamate uptake was altered by multiple meth administrations žtable 1.. the acute changes in
w3 hxdopamine transport were not due to a direct effect of
meth introduced by the original subcutaneous injections
since the mean residual meth concentration present in
the uptake assay was less than 6 nm, which was substantially less than the ic 50 of meth for w3 hxdopamine uptake
ž291 nm. w7x.

results presented in fig. 3a demonstrate that multiple
administrations of meth rapidly and reversibly decreased
w3 hx5ht uptake. transporter activity was reduced 1 h after
the final injection; an effect attributable to a decrease in
vmax , but not k m žtable 1.. the meth-induced decrease
was reversed by 18 h after treatment. again, this acute
effect on w3 hx5ht transporter activity could not be attributed to the effects of meth introduced by the original
injection, since the ic 50 for meth affecting 5ht uptake
was considerably greater ž9 m m. than residual meth
concentrations in the assay žapprox. 30 nm.. this recovery
of  xxxg2150xxx  function was transient; results presented in fig. 3b indicate that synaptosomal w3 hx5ht
uptake was again decreased 1 week after meth treatment.

4. discussion
meth is an amphetamine derivative which causes a
dramatic release of biogenic amines in the central nervous
system. the consequent increase in extracellular
monoamine levels is likely responsible for the locomotor
activity, stereotyped behavior, and addictive properties of
the stimulant. the precise mechanisms by which meth
influences monoamine uptake are still unknown. characterization of its effects may lead not only to a treatment for
meth abuse, but also to an improved understanding of
monoaminergic neuroregulation.
early evidence suggesting that meth administration
gives rise to oxygen radicals includes the observations
that: ž1. multiple meth administrations decrease neostriatal tryptophan hydroxylase activity via an oxidative mechanism ži.e., meth-induced decreases in tryptophan hydroxylase activity are reversed in vitro by exposing the
affected enzyme to a reducing environment. w8,20x; and ž2.
meth increases formation of the oxidized metabolite
 xxxd30xxx  after salicylate administration
w8,9,14x. also relevant to the present study are observations
that exposure to an oxidative environment decreases

w3 hxdopamine uptake. for example, berman et al. w2x have
shown that preincubation of striatal synaptosomes with
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, an agent capable of
preventing iron-catalyzed oxidation of dopamine, prevents
dopamine-induced decreases in its own transporter function. furthermore, this laboratory has demonstrated that
 xxxg2431xxx -induced oxygen radicals reduce dopamine
transporter activity and that this effect is blocked by
superoxide dismutase w6x, an enzyme that scavenges superoxide radicals. because meth stimulates oxygen radical
formation and such species alter  xxxg2149xxx 
function, we hypothesized that meth influences uptake of
other neurotransmitters via oxidative mechanisms. this
possibility was tested by examining the impact of xanthine
oxidase and meth on 5ht and glutamate transporter
activities.
pre-incubation of synaptosomes with the oxygen radical
producing enzyme,  xxxg2431xxx , reduced 5ht, but not
glutamate, transporter function žfig. 1.. as demonstrated
previously w6x, w3 hxdopamine uptake was likewise decreased following  xxxg2431xxx  exposure. the w3 hx5ht,
w3 hxglutamate, and w3 hxdopamine uptake assays were conducted in the same synaptosomal preparations: thus, the
lack of effect on w3 hxglutamate uptake suggests that the
changes in dopamine and  xxxg2150xxx  activities caused
by this oxidative enzyme were not due to a loss of
synaptosomal integrity. previous studies have demonstrated  xxxg2431xxx -mediated decreases in glutamate
transporter activity. the discrepancy between the present
findings and the reports of others may be due to differences in model systems ži.e., astrocytes w23x vs. striatal
synaptosomes. or incubation conditions ži.e., 10 min w1x vs.
5 min  xxxg2431xxx  exposure.. while, based on these
other reports, it is likely that oxygen radicals can decrease
glutamate transporter activity, our data indicate that glutamate transporters are less susceptible than 5ht or dopamine
transporters to this effect.
similar in profile to the effects of  xxxg2431xxx ,
multiple administrations of meth rapidly decreased 5ht
and  xxxg2149xxx  function žfigs. 2 and 3.. the
decreases in w3 hx5ht žtable 1. and w3 hxdopamine uptake
were associated with decreases in vmax . meth concentrations present in the synaptosomal preparations at the time
of these uptake measurements were less than 30 and 6 nm
in 5ht and dopamine assays, respectively. because the
ic 50 values for meth inhibiting 5ht and dopamine
uptake are 9 m m and 291 nm w7x, respectively, it is
unlikely that the residual meth in the synaptosomes
interfered directly with the uptake assay. in contrast to
w3 hx5ht, meth-treatment was without effect on
w3 hxglutamate transport. it has been demonstrated that
there is ‘avid’ uptake of excitatory amino acids into glutaminergic terminals as well as glial cells of the striatum
w11x. because no changes in uptake were observed in the
glutamate preparation, no attempt was made to determine
if meth selectively altered the uptake into either cellular

compartment. it is unlikely that significant meth-induced
changes in terminal or glial uptake would not have been
detected because the uptake into both compartments is
notable and no overall changes of uptake were detected.
the 5ht and dopamine carrier proteins belong to the
same subfamily of naqrcly-dependent transporters and
possess approximately 47% amino acid homology w22x.
both transporters contain sulfhydryl residues in the putative extracellular loops. the cysteine residues of these
transporters could be the targets of reactive species which
arise during the auto-oxidation of monoamines. such a
hypothesis is not without precedence. for example, pardo
et al. w17x demonstrated that catecholamine-derived reactive species alter exposed cysteine residues on the protein
actin. a similar mechanism may contribute to the rapid
inactivation of monoamine transporters by meth. we do
not know the identity of the reactive species responsible
for the effect of meth on 5ht transporters. it could, for
example, be an electrophilic intermediate of monoamine
metabolism interacting with susceptible regions on the
uptake carriers. alternatively, it could be reactive oxygen
species ži.e., hydroxyl or superoxide radicals., generated as
a consequence of monoamine auto-oxidation, that oxidize
the transporter. the latter possibility is supported by our
previous observation that superoxide radicals, produced by
 xxxg2431xxx , contribute to the enzyme-induced decrease in  xxxg2149xxx  activity w6x. future experiments will address the nature of the reactive species
causing the meth-induced impairment of 5ht uptake
function.
distinct from the long-term decrease in  xxxg2150xxx 
function observed after 1 week, recovery of  xxxg2150xxx  activity was observed as soon as 18 h after meth
treatment žfig. 3a.. a similar phenomenon involving
dopamine transporters was reported previously w7x. the
significance of this reversible decrease is as yet unknown.
uptake of 5ht is a major mechanism whereby the transmitter is removed from the synaptic cleft. hence, a
meth-induced decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  function may
increase extracellular 5ht concentrations. since 5ht can
oxidize and its metabolites may be neurotoxic w5x, a
meth-induced decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  activity may
promote neuronal damage. therefore, there may be an
association between the rapid ž1 h. reduction in 5ht
transporter activity, and the long-term ž1 week. decrease
which likely reflects 5ht terminal degeneration w12x. on
the other hand, it is possible that the decrease in 5ht
transporter activity might serve as a neuroprotective mechanism. such a view is not without precedence: 5ht reuptake inhibitors prevent damage to 5ht neurons caused by
multiple meth doses w13,19x. therefore, it is conceivable
that the inhibition of 5ht transporters by ros prevents
auto-oxidized monoamines from entering the neurons and
causing intracellular damage. if inhibition of uptake is
neuroprotective, then the finding that 5ht transport is
decreased 1 week later would indicate that the meth-in-

j.m. kokoshka et al.r brain research 799 (1998) 78–83

duced transporter blockade is either incomplete, or that
distinct mechanisms account for the rapid and long-term
decreases in  xxxg2150xxx  function. investigation into
possible associations between the rapid and long-term
meth-induced decrease in transporter activity is warranted.
in conclusion, the functional attenuation of w3 hx5ht
transport due to  xxxg2431xxx  incubation or multiple
meth administrations parallels changes observed in
w3 hxdopamine transport. w3 hx5ht uptake was decreased 1
h after meth treatment, recovered by 18–24 h, and again
diminished 1 week after treatment. the notion that 5ht
transporters are affected like dopamine transporters suggests that this family of transporters includes carrier proteins vulnerable to oxidative inactivation which leads to
reversible attenuation of uptake function by high doses of
meth. in contrast, glutamate transporters do not appear to
be as sensitive to oxidative effects and are not significantly
altered by high doses of meth. these studies indicate the
selective nature of these meth-induced effects on neurotransmitter transporters.
