abstract
a variety of tumor suppressor genes are down-regulated by hypermethylation during carcinogenesis. using methylated cpg amplificationrepresentation difference analysis, we identified a dna fragment corresponding to the  xxxd3297xxx -induced gene 1 ( xxxg1934xxx ) promoter-associated cpg island
as one of the genes hypermethylated in the leukemia cell line k562. because
 xxxg1934xxx  has been proposed to act as a tumor suppressor, we tested the hypothesis that cytosine methylation of the  xxxg1934xxx  promoter suppresses its expression
and causes a loss of responsiveness to  xxxd3417xxx  in some neoplastic cells.
we examined  xxxg1934xxx  methylation and expression status in 53 human cancer
cell lines and 74 primary tumors, including leukemia and head and neck,
breast, colon, skin, brain, lung, and prostate cancer. loss of  xxxg1934xxx  expression
was strongly associated with  xxxg1934xxx  promoter hypermethylation (p < 0.001).
there was no correlation between  xxxg1934xxx  promoter methylation and that of
retinoid acid receptor ␤2 (rar␤2), another retinoic-induced putative tumor
suppressor gene (p ⴝ 0.78). treatment with the dna methyltransferase
inhibitor 5-aza-2ⴕ- xxxd1836xxx  for 5 days restored  xxxg1934xxx  expression in all
eight silenced cell lines tested.  xxxg1934xxx  expression was also inducible by treatment with 1 ␮m  xxxd3417xxx  for 3 days except in densely methylated
cell lines. treatment of the k562 leukemia cells with demethylating agent
combined with  xxxd3417xxx  induced apoptosis. these findings indicate that silencing of  xxxg1934xxx  promoter by hypermethylation is common in
human cancers and may contribute to the loss of  xxxd3417xxx  responsiveness
in some neoplastic cells.

introduction
retinoids regulate the growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of
normal cells during embryonic development and of premalignant and
malignant cells during carcinogenesis. most of these effects are mediated by nuclear retinoic receptors, which include three retinoid acid
receptors (rars) and three retinoid x receptors, both with designations of ␣, ␤, and ␥; all of these are ligand-dependent transcription
factors. rars can induce the expression of certain genes in a liganddependent manner by binding to the  xxxd3417xxx -responsive elements
in their promoter regions (1–3).
in recent years, many investigators have studied ways to exploit
retinoids clinically.  xxxd3297xxx  ( xxxd3297xxx ), a synthetic retinoid
that binds rar␤ and rar␥, is used in the treatment of psoriasis, a
hyperproliferative skin disorder. one gene induced by  xxxd3297xxx  is
 xxxd3297xxx -induced gene 1 ( xxxg1934xxx ), which was cloned in 1996 by
nagpal et al. (4).  xxxd3297xxx  induces  xxxg1934xxx  in keratinocytes both in
vitro and in vivo via a retinoid receptor-dependent mechanism. previously published information about  xxxg1934xxx  function described its isolation as a gene that is expressed differentially in untreated and
retinoid-treated skin in cultures and its increased expression in psoreceived 1/27/03; revised 1/22/04; accepted 1/30/04.

riatic lesions after  xxxd3297xxx  treatment (5, 6). it was also reported that
strong  xxxg1934xxx  expression could be induced by rar-specific but not
retinoid-x-receptor-specific agents and that  xxxg1934xxx  resembled  xxxg384xxx , a
retinoid-responsive molecule on immune cells (5, 6). very recently,
evidence was reported supporting a tumor suppression role for  xxxg1934xxx 
in prostate cancer (7). jing et al. (7) demonstrated that decreased
expression of  xxxg1934xxx  was associated with an increase in malignant
characteristics of both prostate cancer cell lines and tissues and that
expression of  xxxg1934xxx  is absent in all malignant prostate cells examined.
the mechanism by which  xxxg1934xxx  expression is suppressed in tumor
versus normal cells has not been established. one possibility is cytosine methylation of cpg islands, an epigenetic mechanism of gene
silencing mediated by modulation of the chromatin structure (8). the
discovery that the promoters of numerous tumor suppressor genes are
hypermethylated in neoplastic cells has emphasized epigenetic
changes as important mechanisms in carcinogenesis (9). this finding
led to the development of several techniques for identifying tumor
suppressor genes based on aberrant methylation. in an earlier study,
we used the methylated cpg amplification-representation difference
analysis (mca-rda) technique (10) to identify dna fragments that
were differentially methylated in cancer. this technique was also used
to identify several genes specifically silenced in cancer cells.
in the present study, we used the same technique and identified
 xxxg1934xxx  as a gene whose promoter is methylated and silenced in human
cancer. loss of  xxxg1934xxx  expression might explain the low sensitivity of
some neoplastic cells to retinoid-induced growth regulation.
materials and methods
mca-rda. to identify novel putative tumor suppressor genes based on
the hypermethylation status of promoters, we applied mca-rda to the
leukemia cell line k562 (american type culture collection, rockville, md),
using restriction enzymes with differential sensitivities to 5-methyl-cytosine,
followed by pcr amplification, as detailed previously (10). normal colon
mucosa samples were used as a control. rda was performed as described
previously (11). briefly, two steps of competitive hybridization of the sequences generated from tumor against those from normal cells allowed the
selection of exclusively methylated dna fragments (11).
cell lines and tissues. all of the human cancer cell lines used in this
study, except those specified below, were obtained from american type
culture collection. the university of michigan squamous cell carcinoma cell
lines umscc17a, umscc17b, umscc19, umscc22a, umscc22b,
umscc35, and umscc38 were provided by dr. thomas carey (university
of michigan, ann arbor, mi). details about these cell lines, including their
karyotyping, have been described previously (12–14). the cell lines
mda886ln and mda1483 were provided by dr. peter sacks (new york
university college of dentistry, new york, ny); the cell line tr146 was
provided by dr. alfonse balm (university of amsterdam, amsterdam, the
netherlands); and the cell line sqcc/y1 was provided by dr. michael reiss
(yale university, new haven, ct). all of the cells were grown at 37°c in a
humidified atmosphere composed of 95% air and 5% co2 in a monolayer
culture consisting of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dmem, 10% regular fetal bovine
serum, antibiotics, and either ham’s f-12 nutrient mixture or rpmi 1640.
all of the patient samples, both cancerous and normal, were obtained from
established tissue banks at the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer
center (houston, tx) and the johns hopkins hospital (baltimore, md). solid
tumor samples were from patients who had undergone surgery, leukemia

 xxxg1934xxx  hypermethylation in human cancers

samples were from bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, and normal samples
were from breast, colon, lung, brain, placenta, head, and neck tissues and from
bone marrow, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. sample collection and distribution
were performed under established guidelines of the united states department
of health and human services.
dna extraction and bisulfite-pcr for restriction analysis. genomic
dna from cell lines and human tissues was extracted and purified by use of
a dna extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (stratagene,
la jolla, ca). bisulfite treatment was performed as described previously (15).
in brief, after genomic dna isolation, 2 ␮g of the dna were treated for 16 h
with sodium bisulfite. after the dna was desulfonated and purified with the
wizard dna clean-up system (promega, madison, wi), an aliquot was used
as a template for pcr. methylation of  xxxg1934xxx  was performed by use of
combined bisulfite restriction analysis (cobra), as described previously (15).
the cobra primers designed to amplify the modified dna at the three
different areas in the promoter of  xxxg1934xxx  (fig. 1a) were the first set of primers
(cobra 1) were 5⬘-gagagaatttaggggttg-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘-aaccaaaaaacaaacaacc-3⬘ (antisense), which yielded a 221-bp fragment.
the second set (cobra 2) were 5⬘-ggtagttttaggatgttgggg-3⬘
(sense) and 5⬘-tacccaaatatcacctcccaac-3⬘ (antisense), which also
yielded a 210-bp fragment. the third set of primers (cobra 3) were 5⬘gtttggagaatttaagtag-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘-aatacttctaacccaaacc-3⬘ (antisense), which yielded a 190-bp fragment. for rar␤
isoform 2 (rar␤2) methylation, the pcr primers were 5⬘-aagtagtaggaagtgagttgtttaga-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘-ccaaattctccttccaaataa-3⬘ (antisense), which produced a 207-bp fragment.  xxxg1934xxx  methylation analysis was performed with 20 – 40 ␮l of the amplified products, which
were digested with the restriction enzymes hinfi (for pcr products generated
by cobra 1 primers), bsshii (for cobra 2), and taqi (for cobra 3). for
rar␤2 methylation analysis, the restriction enzyme taii (mbi fermentas,
hanover, md) was used to distinguish methylated sequences from unmethylated ones, and the products were subjected to electrophoresis on 3% agarose or
5% acrylamide gels. dna was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. we
calculated the methylation percentage by dividing the density of the methylated band by the summed densities of both methylated and unmethylated bands
as determined with a densitometer.
methylation-specific pcr (msp). to study  xxxg1934xxx  promoter hypermethylation, we also performed msp as described previously (16). for the  xxxg1934xxx 
promoter methylation study, we designed two sets of primers that could
amplify the modified dna of either the methylated or unmethylated alleles
separately. for the methylated allele (118 bp), the sense primer was 5⬘gtagtacgggcgggtcgc-3⬘ and the antisense primer was 5⬘-gacatcgcctccgcaacg-3⬘. for the unmethylated allele (134 bp), the sense
primer was 5⬘-gaggtagtatgggtgggttgt-3⬘ and the antisense primer
was 5⬘-aatactaaaatacaacatcacctcca-3⬘. the annealing temperatures for the methylated and unmethylated dna were 67°c and 61°c,
respectively, for 40 s each. hot-start pcr with a total cycle number of 30 was
used in all msp dna amplifications. denaturation and extension cycles were
maintained for 30 and 45 s, respectively.
dna cloning and sequencing. we used the same cobra primers, sets 1
and 2, as those used for bisulfite-pcr and cloned the dna fragments into a
pcr2.1 topo vector (invitrogen corporation, carlsbad, ca) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. plasmid dna was extracted and purified with the
qiagen plasmid mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca) and sequenced with an abi
prism 377 dna sequencer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) at the dna
sequencing core facility at the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center.
 xxxd3417xxx  (atra), 5-aza-2ⴕ- xxxd1836xxx  (5-azadcyd), and  xxxd3426xxx  a (tsa) treatment. cell lines were treated with 1
␮m 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo). after daily treatments
over 5 days, the rna was extracted and tested for restoration of  xxxg1934xxx  expression.
 xxxg1934xxx  induction was also analyzed in the cells treated using 1 ␮m atra for 3 days
and 300 nm tsa for 24 h. in a trial to change the atra-resistant cell line k562
to atra-sensitive, we first treated the cell line k562 for 3 days with 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx .
the cells were washed and kept with no treatment for 24 h to allow recovery
before being treated again with 1 ␮m atra during the last 10 days of the 14-day
experiment. the controls were cells kept with either no previous treatment with
5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  or no more treatment with atra.
rna purification for reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr). total
rna obtained from different cell lines was isolated using tri reagent (mo-

lecular research center, inc., cincinnati, oh). rt-pcr reactions using the
access rt-pcr system (promega) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with an annealing temperature of 68°c for 35 cycles.
the sense oligonucleotide used for detection of a 134-nucleotide fragment
originating from the human  xxxg1934xxx  cdna was 5⬘-gaaaaaccccttggaaatagtcagc-3⬘, which corresponded to the region encompassing nucleotides 504 –528 in exon 3. the antisense oligonucleotide used for detection
of the  xxxg1934xxx  transcript was 5⬘-agtgtgacacctgtgttgtcatttcc-3⬘,
which corresponded to positions 638 – 612 in exon 4, beginning from the
translation start site. the genbank accession number of the cdna sequence
was xm_003103. the sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers for the
human  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) cdna, used as
an internal control, were 5⬘-cggagtcaacggattggtcgtat-3⬘ and 5⬘agccttctccatggtggtgaagac-3⬘, respectively. each sample included reverse transcription-negative controls in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted from the initial reverse transcription step. a normal
cdna panel for different organ sites was purchased from bd biosciences
(clontech, palo alto, ca).
quantitative rt-pcr (q-rt-pcr). real-time q-rt-pcr was performed with the 7700 sequence detector (applied biosystems; refs. 17, 18).
we used commercially available primers sets with minor groove binder probe
for  xxxg1934xxx  and ␤-actin as an internal control (applied biosystems). after rna
isolation, cdna was synthesized with random hexanucleotide primers and
reverse transcriptase. each sample included reverse transcription-negative
controls in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted from the initial reverse
transcription step. reactions for q-rt-pcr were performed with the taqman
universal pcr master mix kit (applied biosystems) in 96-well plates. each
sample was measured in triplicate. assembled plates were then covered and
run using the following conditions: an initial denaturation step of 95°c for 10
min followed by 45 cycles at 95°c for 15 s and 60°c for 1 min. the resulting
data were analyzed with abi prism 7000 sds software (applied biosystems).
the threshold cycles (c⌻) were determined and the differences in the c⌻
values for ␤-actin and  xxxg1934xxx  were calculated. because  xxxg1934xxx  expression was
first reported to be lost in prostate cancer cells (7), all q-rt-pcr data in our
present study were normalized to the expression level detected in normal
prostate, which was assigned as 100%. expression results for other tested
samples were calculated relative to the expression in normal prostate.
cell cycle analysis. for detecting cell cycle changes and apoptosis, the
cells were harvested, fixed with cold 70% ethanol, stained with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (19). the
percentage of dead cells among the treated cells was determined by counting
trypan blue-stained cells.
statistical analysis. statistical analyses were performed with the fisher’s
exact test using statview software (sas, cary, nc). two-sided tests were
used to calculate ps; p ⬍ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results
 xxxg1934xxx  hypermethylation in human cancers. by applying mcarda to the analysis of methylated dna in the leukemia cell line
k562, we identified a hypermethylated dna fragment corresponding
to the  xxxg1934xxx  promoter (fig. 1a). because this was the first evidence of
hypermethylation of this gene, we confirmed our results in multiple
human cancers by use of bisulfite-pcr. we used the complementary
methods cobra and msp, as well as dna sequencing in selected
cases. fig. 1b shows examples of the cell lines tested with the
cobra analysis. one finding of note was the variation in the degree
of methylation among the different cell lines. specifically, complete
methylation was seen in hct116 and hl-60, whereas partial methylation was seen in daoy; hut62 is an example of an unmethylated
cell line. table 1 summarizes the analysis of 53 different cell lines
obtained from different organs and sites. in this analysis, we used the
cobra 1 primer set to quantify the relative amounts of methylated
dna in the individual cell lines. as shown in table 1, among the 53
cancer cell lines tested, 11 had methylation densities ⬎60%, 17 cell
lines had methylation densities of 30 – 60%, and 25 cell lines had
methylation densities ⬍30%.

cases, and 11 of 18 (61%) liver cancer cases. significant concordance
(p ⬍ 0.0001) was found between the cobra and msp results in 20
cell lines and in 25 normal and primary tumor tissues tested with both
methods. similarly, we sequenced the cloned pcr fragments from 10
primary colon tumors with their adjacent normal tissues. five to 10
clones were sequenced for each pair of samples. all tumor samples
tested had higher  xxxg1934xxx  promoter methylation densities than their
corresponding individual adjacent normal tissues. fig. 2 shows an
example of the differences in percentage of methylation density as
measured with the cpg sequencing method in two pairs of primary
colon cancers and their adjacent normal tissues.
 xxxg1934xxx  expression in normal and cancer cells. to relate  xxxg1934xxx 
promoter methylation data with  xxxg1934xxx  expression levels, we first
examined constitutive  xxxg1934xxx  expression in a panel of normal tissues by
conventional rt-pcr as well as q-rt-pcr (fig. 4, a and b).  xxxg1934xxx 
expression was detected in total cdna from most of the normal

table 1 human cancer cell lines examined for constitutive  xxxg1934xxx  expression and
percentage of  xxxg1934xxx  promoter methylation

fig. 1.  xxxd3297xxx -induced gene 1 ( xxxg1934xxx ) map and methylation in cancer cells. a, cpg
map of the  xxxg1934xxx  promoter (genbank accession number xm_003103). the location of exon
1 is indicated below the map. of note is the dna fragment generated with methylated cpg
amplification-representation difference analysis and its location, which is very close to exon 1
of the gene. the areas of the promoter analyzed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis
(cobra) and methylation-specific pcr (msp) are also indicated. b, methylation analysis of
the promoter region in selected cell lines (indicated at the top of each lane) by combined
bisulfite restriction analysis. the pcr products from methylated cell lines were digested with
the restriction enzyme hinfi, giving rise to two bands: the upper unmethylated dna populations (u) and the lower methylated dna populations (m). hinfi was unable to digest the
products from the unmethylated cell lines, giving rise to a single discrete 221-bp band. c,
methylation-specific pcr analysis of selected cell lines. u and m represent the unmethylated
and methylated fragments generated by the respective primers.

examples of the results of msp analysis of the cancer cell lines are
shown in fig. 1c. the rko and sqcc/y1 cell lines showed only
unmethylated bands, whereas h1944, hct116, and hl-60 cell lines
showed only methylated bands. individual methylation density percentages of the  xxxg1934xxx  promoter were also confirmed by sequencing of cloned
bisulfite-pcr products with three different cobra primer sets (fig. 1a)
in the cell lines h1944, md468, hl-60, k562, mcf-7, rko, lovo,
sqcc/y1, hct116, and h522. fig. 2 shows examples of methylation
densities detected in sequenced cell lines with use of the second cobra
primer set (5–10 clones were sequenced for each cell line tested). of note,
there was a high concordance between the results generated by promoter
sequencing and those generated with cobra (table 1).
we next studied samples obtained from normal tissues and primary
tumors (fig. 3). the 20 normal tissue samples obtained from organ
banks (examples are given in fig. 3) showed low or no  xxxg1934xxx  promoter
methylation, with a mean methylation of 10% (range, 0 –15%).
among the 74 total primary malignancies examined, 39 (53%) exhibited relatively high  xxxg1934xxx  promoter methylation density, as measured
with the msp and cobra methods. cancer cells with a methylation
level higher than corresponding normal tissue cells were considered to
be methylated. the overall analysis revealed significantly higher  xxxg1934xxx 
promoter methylation values, compared with corresponding normal
tissues, in 8 of 14 (57%) acute myeloid leukemia cases, 3 of 7 (42%)
chronic myeloid leukemia cases, 4 of 10 (40%) colon cancer cases, 10
of 16 (63%) head and neck cancer cases, 3 of 9 (33%) breast cancer

 xxxg1934xxx  hypermethylation in human cancers

fig. 2. methylation density percentages in cancer
cell lines and colon primary tumors. a, methylation
density measured by sequencing of 29 cpg sites in
selected human cancer cell lines. the pcr fragment
generated with the second combined bisulfite restriction analysis primer set was cloned and sequenced as detailed in the “materials and methods”
section. b, methylation density measured as in a but
with two primary colon tumor samples (t) and their
adjacent normal tissues (n). e represent unmethylated cpg sites; f represent methylated cpg sites.
numbers of sequenced clones for each tested sample
are given.

tissues tested, with some degree of variation. no or minimal promoter
methylation was detected in normal tissues that showed diminished
expression, such as normal leukocytes.
regarding cancer cell lines, table 1 shows the relative individual
expression levels in relation to methylation percentage. in this analysis (table 1), we found that in 11 cell lines with  xxxg1934xxx  methylation
densities ⬎60%, all showed complete loss of  xxxg1934xxx  expression. seventeen cell lines showed a methylation density of 30 – 60%. of these, 12
cell lines showed complete loss or markedly diminished  xxxg1934xxx  expression. in the remaining 21 cell lines with  xxxg1934xxx  methylation density
⬍30%, all showed high  xxxg1934xxx  expression, and 4 cell lines were
undetermined. a statistical analysis of the data (table 1) by use of
fisher’s exact test indicated that loss of expression in these cell lines
was correlated with hypermethylation of the  xxxg1934xxx  (p ⬍ 0.001). as
shown in table 1 and fig. 4c,  xxxg1934xxx  gene expression was diminished
or lost in 24 of the 47 (51%) cancer cell lines tested by conventional
rt-pcr. there was an excellent concordance with the results generated by q-rt-pcr in 20 cancer cell lines (fig. 4d). a few cell lines
had relatively high  xxxg1934xxx  methylation values (e.g., mda-886ln, dupro, and mb453) along with various degrees of expression (table 1).
this can probably be explained by the  xxxg1934xxx  promoter being incompletely suppressed through coexistence of unmethylated alleles.
regarding primary tumor samples,  xxxg1934xxx  expression was decreased
in one and was lost in two of the six acute myeloid leukemia samples
(fig. 4e) and decreased or lost in three of the seven colon cancer
samples obtained from different patients. fig. 4f shows the relative
differences in  xxxg1934xxx  expression as measured by q-rt-pcr in two
primary colon cancer with their adjacent normal mucosa tissues. fig.
5 shows the correlation between loss of  xxxg1934xxx  expression in two other
colon tumor cases with their corresponding adjacent normal tissues,
and  xxxg1934xxx  methylation density.

showed diminished expression (fig. 6a). all of the tested cell lines
(k562, h460, h522, mcf-7, sw48, hct116, hl-60, and umscc38)
showed reactivation and restoration of  xxxg1934xxx  expression after 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx

treatment, albeit to different degrees. these data indicated that repression
of  xxxg1934xxx  was mediated at least in part by  xxxg1934xxx  promoter hypermethylation. on the other hand, the  xxxd565xxx  tsa failed to
restore or increase  xxxg1934xxx  expression, even in the unmethylated cell lines.
we did, however, observe augmentation of  xxxg1934xxx  expression when tsa
was combined with 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  (fig. 6b). because no commercial
antibody was available at the time, we restricted our analysis to mrna
levels in this study.
 xxxg1934xxx  and rar␤2 promoter methylation. to determine whether
 xxxg1934xxx  promoter methylation was associated with methylation of the
promoter of rar␤2, another retinoic-induced putative tumor suppressor gene, we examined methylation of the rar␤2 promoter by cobra in a panel of 29 human cancer cell lines. thirteen (45%) of the
cell lines showed reversed states of methylation for the two promoters,
and there was no correlation between  xxxg1934xxx  and rar␤2 promoter
methylation (p ⫽ 0.78). table 2 shows examples of cancer cell lines
discordant for rar␤2 and  xxxg1934xxx  methylation.
atra-induced  xxxg1934xxx  expression.  xxxg1934xxx  expression is normally
induced by  xxxd3417xxx  treatment. we therefore tested the effect of
methylation on this induction. table 2 shows a correlation between the
level of constitutive  xxxg1934xxx  expression and its methylation status as well as
its inducibility by treatment with 1 ␮m atra for 3 days. specifically, all
four cell lines with low methylation densities (ⱕ20% in the cell lines
mentioned in table 2) of  xxxg1934xxx  promoter showed constitutive expression
of  xxxg1934xxx  and inducibility by atra.  xxxg1934xxx  expression was not induced in
most of the cell lines with a higher promoter methylation density (⬎60%
in the cell lines mentioned in table 2) after the same atra treatment.
however, 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  restored or increased expression in all cell lines
tested, including the cell lines not restored by atra (hct116, mcf-7,
h522, and h460; table 2 and fig. 6a). the effect of atra on  xxxg1934xxx 
induction is shown in fig. 6c. cancer cell lines with lower methylation
densities (h1792 and rko) had adequate induction of  xxxg1934xxx  after atra
treatment. in contrast, the cell line with higher methylation density

 xxxg1934xxx  hypermethylation in human cancers

treatment with 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  induced significant apoptosis (sub-g1, 50%).
compared with control cells (fig. 7a), 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx -treated cells without
atra showed no change in the percentage of apoptosis measured at the
end of the experiment (fig. 7b). the sub-g1 percentage representing the
apoptosis population was confirmed by a comparable percentage of cell
death, as measured by trypan blue staining (data not shown). similar
results were obtained when we studied other cell lines, such as the breast
cancer cell lines cama-1 and bt-474, using 1 ␮m atra after 0.1 ␮m
5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  for 3 days. however, the lung cancer cell line h460 did not
show significant differences between the different groups (data not
shown). next we measured  xxxg1934xxx  expression using the relative ratio of the
rt-pcr products ( xxxg1934xxx : xxxg861xxx ) to test whether the induction of apoptosis in k562 cells (which do not express  xxxg1934xxx  at basal levels) is related
to restoration of  xxxg1934xxx  expression. whereas atra induced  xxxg1934xxx  in k562
(20% in arbitrary units), combined treatment with atra after 5-azadcyd had a synergistic effect on  xxxg1934xxx  induction (70% in arbitrary units),
as measured on day 10 of the experiment. however, some other retinoidinduced gene(s) might be involved in the apoptotic response to such a
combined treatment.

atra-induced apoptosis in the cell line k562. to determine
the potential role of  xxxg1934xxx  in  xxxd3417xxx  responsiveness independently
of rar␤2, we studied the cell line k562. this cell line showed dense
methylation of the  xxxg1934xxx  promoter and reduced  xxxg1934xxx  expression, which
was reversible by 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  treatment (fig. 6a), but no methylation of
the rar␤2 promoter (data not shown). cells treated with atra alone
for 10 days did not show cell growth suppression or an increased
percentage of apoptosis (fig. 7c), indicating atra resistance. however,
as shown in fig. 7d, atra treatment for 10 days after an initial 3-day

inactivation of tumor suppressor genes can be accomplished in several
ways, including deletion, mutation, and epigenetic silencing of gene
expression by methylation or changes in histone acetylation. mca-rda
has been useful in the identification of putative tumor suppressor genes
based on hypermethylation status of promoters (10). using this method,
we identified a dna fragment corresponding to the  xxxg1934xxx  promoterassociated cpg islands in the leukemia cell line k562. we confirmed that
the  xxxg1934xxx  promoter was hypermethylated in approximately half of the
cases tested in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors samples. we
also found that  xxxg1934xxx  expression was correlated with the methylation
status of its promoter and was restored in selected cell lines after 5-azadcyd treatment. these findings suggest that  xxxg1934xxx  expression is silenced
primarily by hypermethylation.
treatment of several cell lines with the  xxxd565xxx  tsa failed to restore  xxxg1934xxx  expression. this failure suggests that
the acetylation status of the  xxxg1934xxx  gene was not dominant in explaining
silencing. in several earlier studies using leukemia cell lines, tsa was
shown to inhibit histone deacetylation but not to activate transcription
as a single agent (20, 21). in these studies, atra was required in
addition to tsa to induce engagement of histone acetyltransferase,
thereby acetylating adjacent histones and promoting chromatin relaxation and binding of transcription factors to response elements in
dna to initiate transcription.
interestingly, we found that  xxxg1934xxx  expression was decreased or lost
in all of the cell lines that had a methylated  xxxg1934xxx  promoter and could
not be restored in those cell lines after 3 days of treatment with 1 ␮m
atra. on the other hand, similar treatment of cell lines that exhib-

 xxxg1934xxx  hypermethylation in human cancers

tics of this gene are inactivated by silencing. interestingly, we included in our present study four prostate cancer cell lines that were
used in the study by jing et al. (7). we found that three of these four
cell lines had diminished  xxxg1934xxx  expression as a result of hypermethylation of  xxxg1934xxx  promoter. these results can complement and support
the potential suppressor role of  xxxg1934xxx  in prostate cancer.
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that hypermethylationassociated silencing of the  xxxg1934xxx  gene occurs in a variety of human
cancers and that 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  can reverse  xxxg1934xxx  silencing, indicating
that  xxxg1934xxx  repression is mediated in part by promoter hypermethylation. these data also reinforce the potential importance of retinoids in
cancer therapy (25, 26).

ited basal expression of  xxxg1934xxx  resulted in a significant induction of
expression. in a previous study (22), we observed the same pattern in
the inducibility of rar␤2 expression, which occurred only in cell
lines that had at least some basal endogenous expression of rar␤2.
these data suggest that individual cell lines with a minimum endogenous level of  xxxg1934xxx  expression exhibit an increase in expression
after  xxxd3417xxx  treatment. these results imply that silencing of
 xxxg1934xxx  by hypermethylation contributes to the loss of  xxxd3417xxx 
responsiveness in some neoplastic cells.
approximately half of the 29 cell lines in which the  xxxg1934xxx  and
rar␤2 promoter status was determined showed divergence in the
methylation status of the two genes, although both genes are located
in the same region on chromosome 3p. furthermore, induction of
 xxxg1934xxx  expression was independent of rar␤2 promoter methylation
status. the  xxxd3417xxx -induced apoptosis of k562 cells, which have
 xxxg1934xxx  but not rar␤2 promoter methylation, was also in line with the
proposed independent role of  xxxg1934xxx  in  xxxd3417xxx  responsiveness.
the induction of apoptosis after combined treatment with 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx 
and atra is possibly explained by  xxxd3417xxx  acting on the
demethylated cell population generated after 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  treatment.
the k562 cell lines was previously reported to be resistant to differentiation induction by atra (23, 24). similar results were obtained
when we studied other cell lines, such as the breast cancer cell lines
cama-1 and bt-474, but using 1 ␮m of atra after only 0.1 ␮m of
5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  instead of 1 ␮m as in the cell line k562. our results
suggest that atra combined with 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  restores the responsiveness of atra independent of rar␤2 reactivation, pointing the
way to human clinical trials for combining atra or  xxxd3297xxx  with
demethylating agents such as 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  to restore lost  xxxg1934xxx  expression in some human cancers.
jing et al. (7) recently demonstrated tumor suppression properties
for the  xxxg1934xxx  gene in prostate cancer. they showed that transfection of
 xxxg1934xxx  into prostate cancer cells decreased invasiveness in vitro and
tumorigenicity in vivo in nude mice. our study shows that methylation
may be one mechanism by which the tumor suppression characteris-
