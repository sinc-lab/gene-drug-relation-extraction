abstract
agents that activate the dopamine d2-like family of receptors elicit emesis in humans and other species with a vomiting/emetic reflex;
however, the lack of dopamine receptor subtype selective agonists has hampered an understanding of which dopamine d2-like receptor
subtype(s) contributes to the emetic response. in this study, stable cell lines expressing the ferret dopamine d2-long (d2l) and d4 receptors
were used to characterize known dopamine agonists via radioligand binding and calcium ion flux assays, while emetic activity of these
dopamine receptor agonists was determined in male ferrets. latencies to first emetic event, average number of emetic episodes, and
stereotypical behaviors which may be indicative of nausea were also determined. agonists at dopamine d1-like and d4 receptors had no
emetic effect in ferrets. conversely, stimulation of dopamine d2 and/or d3 receptors resulted in a robust emetic response characterized by a
relatively short latency (< 15 min) and multiple emetic events. competitive antagonists of dopamine d2-like receptors ( xxxd1927xxx ,
haloperidol) dose-dependently blocked the emetic response to pnu95666e, a  xxxg656xxx  selective agonist. thus, dopamine d2
and/or  xxxg657xxx  agonists elicit emesis, while dopamine d1/d5 or  xxxg658xxx -selective agonists are devoid of emetic properties.

1. introduction
diverse stimuli can trigger an emetic response in
mammals that possess a vomiting reflex. these stimuli
include chemical, biological, and physical agents. regardless of their nature, emetic stimuli elicit emesis through
several neural mechanisms (andrews and hawthorn, 1988).
while peripheral-acting emetic stimuli activate visceral
afferent neurons that project to the nucleus tractus solitarius
(nts) and fvomiting center_, blood-borne centrally acting
emetogens are detected by the area postrema, a circumventricular organ located in the brainstem (miller and

leslie, 1994). results from vagotomy and area postrema
ablation studies demonstrate that emetic stimuli can display
varying degrees of selectivity (or none at all) for peripheral
or central emetic pathways. dopaminergic, serotonergic,
cholinergic, and tachykinin neurotransmitter systems have
all been implicated in emetic pathways in the nts and area
postrema (andrews and rudd, 2004; andrews et al., 1990).
in this report, we have investigated which dopamine
receptor subtypes are responsible for the emetic response
in ferrets, a laboratory species with an emetic response to
many emetogens that is similar to humans (andrews et al.,
1990; king, 1990).
the actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine are
mediated by specific g-protein coupled receptors that can
be divided into two major families based on their ability to
stimulate (d1-like) or inhibit (d2-like) adenylate cyclase
(kebabian and calne, 1979; vallone et al., 2000). two

dopamine d1-like receptors (d1 and d5) and three human
dopamine d2-like receptors (d2, d3 and d4) have been
identified by cdna and genomic cloning (vallone et al.,
2000). two isoforms of the  xxxg656xxx  exist,
d2s and d2l (‘‘short’’ and ‘‘long’’, respectively), based on
the absence or presence of a 29 amino acid segment in the
third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor (missale et al.,
1998). the two isoforms display differences in g-protein
coupling, sequestration rate, and regional distribution. the
delineation of the role of specific dopamine receptors has
been hampered by the lack of highly selective receptor
ligands as well as a comparative pharmacology of
dopaminergic receptors. apomorphine is a nonselective
dopamine receptor ligand that has historically been
described as a dopamine d2-like receptor agonist. apomorphine is highly emetic in a variety of species including
dogs (niemegeers and janssen, 1965), ferrets (florczyk et
al., 1982; andrews et al., 1986; king 1988, 1990; osinski
et al., 2003) and humans (schofferman, 1976). the emetic
effect of apomorphine is thought to result from activation
of dopamine receptors because dopamine d2-like receptor
antagonists prevent apomorphine-elicited emesis in dogs
(hsu et al., 1986), ferrets (king, 1988), and humans
(corsini et al., 1979). however, studies examining localization of dopamine d2, d3 and d4 receptors in the nts
and area postrema in humans show the presence of all
three receptors (hyde et al., 1996). further, a comparative
pharmacology across human dopamine d2-like receptors
compared in the same assay system shows that apomorphine is a potent full agonist at dopamine d2, d3 and d4
receptors and that  xxxd1927xxx  can block all three
receptors as well (newman-tancredi et al., 2002; moreland
et al., 2004).
dopamine receptor agonists are important therapeutics
for the treatment of several disorders including parkinson’s disease, hyperprolactinemia, and to a lesser extent,
heart failure. the nonselective dopamine receptor agonist
apomorphine has been demonstrated to be efficacious for
the treatment of erectile dysfunction (bukofzer and
livesey, 2001). unfortunately, nausea and vomiting are
dose-limiting side effects. recent preclinical data suggest
that  xxxg658xxx  activation is capable of
producing pro-erectile activity in rats (hsieh et al.,
2004); however, the lack of vomiting reflex in rats leaves
the question of emetogenicity of  xxxg658xxx 
agonists unanswered. little is known about potential
emetogenicity of  xxxg658xxx  agonists due to
the relative absence of dopamine d4 subtype-selective
agonists as well as an underappreciation of therapeutic
uses of agonists of this pharmacologic class. in this
report, the pharmacology of ferret dopamine d2l and d4
receptors is characterized in vitro and correlated with in
vivo behavioral results (i.e., emetic activity) in ferrets. a
preliminary version of these results was presented in
poster format at the 2004 society for neuroscience
meeting held in san diego, ca, usa.

2. materials and methods
2.1. cloning and expression of ferret dopamine d2l and d4
receptors
ferret dopamine d2l receptor c-dna was cloned by rtpcr from ferret whole brain poly-a rna using primers
designed from the published human sequence (genbank
accession no. ay394849). ferret  xxxg658xxx  cdna was cloned by rt-pcr from ferret whole brain polya rna using primers designed from the published human
sequence (genbank accession no. ay394848). hek293
cells were co-transfected with an expression vector for ferret
dopamine d2l or  xxxg658xxx  plus an expression vector for a
gaqo5 chimeric g protein (moreland et al., 2004). stable
colonies were selected with 200 mg/l  xxxd2191xxx  (ferret
dopamine d2l or  xxxg658xxx  selection) and 200 mg/l
hygromycin b (gaqo5 selection).
2.2. calcium flux assay
pharmacological responses to dopaminergic receptor
ligands were measured using a calcium imaging technique
(moreland et al., 2004). fluo-4 am, a fluorescent ca2 +
chelating dye, was used as an indicator of the relative levels
of intracellular ca2 + in a 96-well format with a fluorescence
imaging plate reader (flipr, molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). all reagents were prepared in dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (d-pbs) containing 0.004%
 xxxd228xxx  and 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx . cells were grown to
90% confluence in 96-well black-walled clear bottom polyd-lysine coated plates (biocoat, bd biosciences) and
loaded with fluo-4am and pluronic f-127 in d-pbs for
1 – 2 h at room temperature. prior to assay, the cells were
washed with d-pbs containing 0.004%  xxxd228xxx  and
0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx . in the case of antagonism experiments,
antagonists were added 3 min before the addition of 1 am
dopamine. data shown are based on the peak increase in
relative fluorescence units as compared to 10 am dopamine.
a full agonist was defined as a compound that produced a
response  80% of the response elicited by dopamine in this
assay.
2.3. radioligand binding assay
membranes were prepared from a stable hek293 cell
line expressing the ferret dopamine d2l receptor. confluent cells growing in a cell factory (vwr, plainfield,
nj) were detached with cell dissociation buffer and the cell
pellet homogenized using a polytron for 10 s in 50 mm
tris – hcl, ph 7.4. after the homogenate was centrifuged
for 30 min at 100,000 g, the membranes were stored at
80 -c until use. for  xxxg656xxx  binding
assays, the membranes were incubated with the dopamine
d2-like receptor agonist [125i]-pipat 0.6 nm, 50 mm
tris – hcl, ph 7.4, 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and 1 mm edta as

previously described (vessotskie et al., 1997; moreland et
al., 2004). nonspecific binding was determined in the
presence of 10 am spiperone. the reaction was terminated
by filtration using a filtermate harvester (packard,
meriden, ct). radioactivity was measured using a topcount microplate scintillation counter (packard). protein
content was determined by bca protein assay kit (pierce,
rockford, il). competition curves were analyzed by
nonlinear regression using the curve-fitting program
(prism, graphpad software, san diego, ca). all assays
were performed in triplicate and ic50 values were
converted to k i values by the method of cheng and
prusoff (1973).
2.4. animals
all procedures involving animals were reviewed and
approved by the abbott laboratories animal care and use
committee. united states department of agriculture
(usda) regulations on the scientific use of laboratory
animals were strictly followed. castrated male ferrets (0.9 –
1.7 kg; fitch, albino, or siamese coat coloration) were
purchased from marshall farms (north rose, ny) and were
housed in groups of 3 in a temperature (20 -c) and humidity
(50%) controlled environment. animals were maintained on
a 12-h light– dark cycle with lights on at 0600 hours. food
(marshall premium ferret diet; marshall pet products,
wolcott, ny) and water were available ad libitum up until
¨ 18 h prior to the beginning of a study, at which time food
was withdrawn. each ferret was tested no more than 4 times
with a randomly assigned emetogen; a minimum of 14 days
elapsed between emetic challenges. this challenge schedule
is sufficient to prevent either desensitization of the emetic
response or conditioning (andrews et al., 1990; abbott
labs, unpub. observ.).
2.5. emesis studies
emesis studies were carried out as previously described
(osinski et al., 2003). briefly, animals were placed in
individual polycarbonate cages with ventilated tops and
allowed to acclimate to the experimental room for 1 h prior
to commencing study. with the exception of apomorphine,
drugs were dissolved in sterile saline and injected subcutaneously (1 ml/kg body weight) in the subscapular region.
vehicle for apomorphine was sterile saline with 0.1%
 xxxd228xxx  added as an antioxidant. emesis experiments
were also conducted with haloperidol and  xxxd1927xxx ,
competitive antagonists of dopamine d2-like receptors.
each antagonist was tested at 0.1 amol/kg, s.c. pilot
dose –response experiments demonstrated that this dose of
either antagonist administered 30 min prior to emetic
challenge with dopamine receptor agonist completely
blocked the emetic and nausea index response to maximally
emetic doses of apomorphine or pnu-95666e. after
dosing, ferrets were observed in blinded fashion for 90

213

min for vomiting and the presence of a collection of
stereotypical behaviors displayed by ferrets prior to
vomiting that has been argued to be an index of the
subjective sensation of nausea in this species (zaman et al.,
2000). the behaviors recorded were licking, mouth-clawing, backward walking, gagging, and burying of the head in
cage bedding (osinski et al., 2003). the number of these
behaviors displayed by each animal during the observation
period was recorded and used to calculate a nausea index
as described in the next section. although the animals were
fasted for ¨ 18 h prior to study, the ferrets would still expel
gastric juice upon emetic challenge. additional data
recorded were latency to the first emetic episode and the
number of emetic episodes. an emetic episode was defined
as one or more vomits (i.e., the forceful oral expulsion of
liquid or solid upper gastrointestinal contents by an
individual ferret) that is temporally separated from a
second episode by an emesis-free period of at least 30 s
(osinski et al., 2003).
2.6. data analysis
in vitro data are presented as mean t s.e.m. for the in
vivo ferret studies, the incidence of vomiting in response to
a given dose of drug was calculated as the percentage of
animals that vomited one or more times during the
observation period divided by the total number of animals
tested. for drugs that caused emesis, ed50 values and
associated 95% confidence intervals were calculated by the
method of litchfield and wilcoxon (1949) using pharm/
pcs software (v. 4.2; microcomputer specialists, philadelphia, pa). a nausea index was defined as the mean
(t sem) number of nausea behaviors observed among all
animals in a given dose group. statistics were calculated
with minitab statistical software (release 11; minitab inc.,
state college, pa). p values < 0.05 were considered
significant.
2.7. reagents
pluronic f-127 and fluo-4am were purchased from
molecular probes (eugene, or). d-pbs (cat no. 11965084),  xxxd2191xxx , hygromycin b and all tissue culture reagents
were purchased from invitrogen (rockville, md). n-[4-(2cyano-phenyl)- xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl]-3-methyl-benzamide
maleate (pd168077; glase et al., 1997), 5-fluoro-2-(4pyridin-2-yl- xxxd2960xxx -1-ylmethyl)-1h-indole (cp226269;
zorn et al., 1997), 5-methylamino-5, 6-dihydro-1h, 4himidazo [4,5,1-ij] quinoline-2-thione (pnu142774e;
meglasson et al., 2001) and 5-methylamino-5, 6-dihydro1h, 4h-imidazo[4,5,1-ij] quinolin-2-one (pnu95666e;
heier et al., 1997) were synthesized at abbott laboratories.
7-hydroxy-n, n-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-hydroxydpat), r(+)-6-chloro-7, 8-dihydro-1-phenyl-2, 3, 4, 5tetrahydro-1h-3-benzazephrine (skf81297) and all other
chemicals were purchased from sigma.

3. results
3.1. in vitro functional studies
in order to determine the selectivity of dopaminergic
ligands at dopamine d2l and d4 receptors, the ferret
dopamine d2l and d4 receptors were cloned and coexpressed with a chimeric g protein (gaqo5) in hek293
cells. this allowed the gai/o-coupled dopamine d2l and
d4 receptors to signal through gq, resulting in a robust
calcium signal that is readily measured with automated
fluorometric detection. the pharmacology and selectivity
of the ferret cell lines with representative selective agonists
for dopamine d1, d2, d3 and d4 receptors are shown in
table 1. dopamine was chosen as the reference agonist to
which the efficacies of all other tested drugs were
compared (fig. 1). dopamine produced a concentrationdependent increase in intracellular calcium with an ec50
value of 8.9 t 0.8 nm at the ferret d2l receptor (fig. 1a
and table 1). this is consistent with the k i value of
12.4 t 0.7 nm obtained from competitive binding with
[125i]-pipat. the nonselective dopamine d2-like receptor
agonists, apomorphine and quinpirole, also displayed full
agonist activity (> 85% efficacy in comparison to 10 am
dopamine) at the ferret dopamine d2l receptor while their
respective potencies were 2.2 t 0.6 and 27.9 t 9.5 nm.
these potencies were comparable to the competition
binding k i values obtained with [125i]-pipat of 2.9 t 0.9
and 53.9 t 4.2 nm.
the dopamine d1-like selective agonist (skf81297) was
essentially inactive in both the ferret dopamine d2l calcium
flux assay and binding (ec50 > 10,000 nm). the dopamine
d 2 receptor selective compounds, pnu95666e and
pnu142774e (meglasson et al., 2001), were full agonists
in the ferret dopamine d2l calcium flux assay with ec50
values of 46.1 t 8.6 and 34.6 t 8.5 nm, respectively. these
potencies were comparable to competition binding k i values
with [125i]-pipat of 73.1 t10.9 and 38.9 t 7.1 nm. the
reportedly selective  xxxg657xxx  agonist 7-oh
dpat showed full agonist activity at the ferret dopamine
d2l receptor with an ec50 value of 5.2 t 2.0 and a k i value

of 9.8 t 0.6 nm obtained in competition binding with [125i]pipat. the dopamine d 4 receptor selective agonist
pd168077 was inactive in the ferret dopamine d2l calcium
flux assay and had a k i value of 828 nm in competitive
binding experiments with [125i]-pipat. another reported
 xxxg658xxx  agonist, cp226269, displayed partial
agonism (57% efficacy) with a potency of 320 t 50 nm and
a k i value of 261 t 54 nm at the ferret dopamine d2l
receptor.
in order to determine the dopamine d 4 receptor
selectivity of the dopaminergic agonists tested above, they
were also tested in the ferret dopamine d4 calcium flux
assay (fig. 1b). as expected, dopamine was a full agonist at
the ferret  xxxg658xxx  with an ec50 value of
2.8 t 0.6 nm. apomorphine and quinpirole were also full
agonists at the ferret  xxxg658xxx  (ec50 values of
1.5 t 0.1 and 22.8 t 2.9 nm, respectively). skf81297, the
dopamine d1-like selective agonist, was inactive in both
ferret d2l calcium flux assay and binding but showed weak
activity at the ferret  xxxg658xxx  (1750 t 83 nm).
pnu95666e and pnu142774e, dopamine d2l selective
agonists, were inactive at the ferret  xxxg658xxx . a
reportedly dopamine d3 selective agonist but demonstrated
in our laboratory to be a full agonist at the ferret dopamine
d2l receptor, 7-oh dpat, was also a full agonist at the
ferret  xxxg658xxx  with an ec50 value of 24.3 t 4.3 nm. as
expected, pd168077 elicited full agonist activity at the
 xxxg658xxx  (16.6 t 2.4 nm), while cp226269
exerted partial agonist activity (72% efficacy) with a
potency of 24.8 t 5.6 nm at the  xxxg658xxx .
all of the dopamine agonists were also tested in hek293
cells or hek293 cells transfected with gq05, and no signal
was observed. the nonselective antagonists, haloperidol and
 xxxd1927xxx , did not activate either ferret dopamine d2l or
d4 receptors (data not shown), but did inhibit the agonist
activity of 1 am dopamine at the both receptors. the k i
value obtained with competitive binding for haloperidol
(0.22 t 0.02 nm) correlates with the k i value from calcium
flux experiments (0.30 t 0.09 nm); however,  xxxd1927xxx ’s
k i value obtained from binding was 10-fold greater than the
k i value determined by the calcium flux assay (table 2).

flipr. agonist responses were expressed as the mean t sem percentage of the response to 10 am dopamine (n = 4 – 8).

3.2. emesis
3.2.1. nonselective dopamine receptor activation
apomorphine, a dopamine d2-like receptor agonist
produced a robust, reproducible emetic response in ferrets.
the apomorphine emetic dose – response curve was bellshaped, with emesis beginning at a dose of 0.03 amol/kg
and peaking at 0.3 amol/kg (table 3). the dopamine d2-like
receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.03 – 0.3 amol/kg, s.c.,
given 30 min prior to apomorphine) dose-dependently
reversed the emetic response to apomorphine (0.3 amol/
kg), with complete prevention of emesis at a haloperidol
dose of 0.1 amol/kg (data not shown). neither antagonist
elicited emesis or a non-zero nausea index value when
administered in the absence of agonist (table 2). the
nausea index values produced in response to apomorphine
mimicked the emetic response, dose-dependently rising to a
maximum of 14.5 t 3.7 behaviors/group at the peak emetic
apomorphine dose of 0.3 amol/kg, and then gradually
diminishing at higher apomorphine doses. haloperidol
reduced nausea index values to 0.
dopamine d1-like receptor activation. the dopamine
d1/ xxxg659xxx  agonist skf-81297 did not elicit vomiting/retching in ferrets at subcutaneous doses ranging from
0.1 to 3.0 amol/kg. the skf-81297 doses chosen are

similar to those that modify a variety of behaviors in rats
(cohen et al., 1999). therefore,  xxxg655xxx 
activation is unlikely to be emetic at behaviorally
relevant doses. no prodromal behaviors were observed
over the dose range tested, resulting in nausea index
values of 0.
3.2.2. dopamine d2-like receptor activation
a variety of agonists with varying degrees of selectivity
at dopamine d2-like receptors were tested for their emetic
effects in ferrets (table 3). like apomorphine, the nonselective dopamine d2-like receptor agonist quinpirole was
a very potent emetogen, with an ed50 value of 0.09 amol/kg

data are expressed as mean t sem for results that contain at least 3 observations; otherwise, only the mean is displayed. six to 24 animals were tested at each
dose. time to emesis and # of episodes only includes those animals which experienced emesis.

(95% ci: 0.06 –0.13). other, reportedly more selective
dopamine d2 agonists also were also highly emetic. both
pnu95666e and pnu142774e elicited dose-dependent
emetic responses in ferrets, with respective ed50 values of
0.89 and 0.52 amol/kg (respective 95% ci: 0.67 – 1.17 and
0.32 – 0.84). quinpirole, pnu95666e, and pnu142774e
dose-dependently increased nausea index values; the
maximum nausea index value for each of these compounds
was approximately twice as large as the nausea index value
obtained with apomorphine. the dopamine d2-like receptor
competitive antagonists haloperidol and  xxxd1927xxx  dosedependently prevented the emetic response to pnu95666e.
the antagonists also reduced the nausea index values to 0.
in total, these results confirm that  xxxg656xxx 
activation results in emesis.
the dopamine d2/ xxxg657xxx  selective compound 7oh-dpat evoked a dose-dependent emetic response when

tested at doses ranging from 0.03 to 0.3 amol/kg. the
ed50 value for emesis was 0.14 amol/kg (0.05 –0.37). a
dose-dependent increase in the nausea index was observed
with 7-oh-dpat, with a maximum value (26.7 t 6.1
behaviors/group) similar to that produced by the selective
 xxxg656xxx  agonists quinpirole, pnu95666e,
and pnu142774e. two dopamine d4 selective agonists,
pd168077 and cp226229, were not emetic when administered to ferrets at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 amol/kg.
these doses span the range deemed efficacious for
eliciting penile erection in rats (hsieh et al., 2004).
although a limited number of prodromal behaviors was
observed in response to each of these compounds, the
mean number of behaviors was quite small (< 1.5
behaviors/group) and the behaviors did not display dosedependency. therefore, we conclude that dopamine d4
receptor activation is not emetic in this species.

4. discussion
in order to determine the specific dopamine receptor
responsible for the emetic effects of dopamine receptor
ligands, we cloned and expressed the ferret dopamine d2l
and d4 receptors in stable cell lines. co-transfection of the
cells with a chimeric gaqo5 resulted in a functional in vitro
assay for assessing the dopamine receptor selectivity of a
variety of dopamine receptor ligands. this assay relies upon
a highly sensitive fluorometric calcium imaging technique
that lends itself well to automated data collection (chambers
et al., 2003). the dopamine receptor ligands characterized in
vitro were then tested in conscious ferrets for their emetic
activity. the major finding of this study was that dopamine
 xxxg658xxx  selective agonists were not emetic in ferrets.
the results obtained with the functional calcium flux
assay for the ferret dopamine d2l receptor correlate very
well with the potencies obtained with competition binding
using the dopamine receptor agonist radioligand [125i]pipat. the binding affinities for compounds that had full
agonist activity at the ferret dopamine d2l receptor
(dopamine, apomorphine, quinpirole, pnu-95666e, pnu142774e) were highly correlated with the potencies
obtained in the calcium flux assay. as expected, the
dopamine d4 selective agonist pd168077 was inactive in
the ferret dopamine d2l calcium flux assay and had very
weak binding affinity at the ferret dopamine d2l receptor
(k i = 828 nm). cp226269, a reported dopamine d4 agonist
(zorn et al., 1997), had a binding affinity of 261 nm and
showed partial agonist activity at the ferret d2l receptor in
the calcium flux assay (57% efficacy) with an ec50 of 320
nm. these data agree with previous data obtained for
human dopamine d2l receptor-transfected cell lines (newman-tancredi et al., 2002; moreland et al., 2004). these
results suggest that, in contrast to radioligand-binding
assays, the high-throughput in vitro calcium flux assay
can accurately predict functional  xxxg656xxx 
agonist activity of novel chemical entities.
while the emetic activity of dopamine d2-selective
agonists has been firmly established in a variety of species
for decades (eggleston and hatcher, 1912; costello and
borison, 1977; florczyk et al., 1982; darmani et al., 1999),
most of these studies have used apomorphine as test drug.
numerous studies, including receptor-binding and in vitro
functional assays, provide ample evidence that apomorphine
is not a dopamine d2-specific receptor agonist, but displays
agonism at dopamine d2, d3, and  xxxg658xxx  subtypes
(newman-tancredi et al., 2002; moreland et al., 2004).
using in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches, we
have shown that  xxxg656xxx  agonists are highly
emetic in ferrets. yoshikawa et al., (1996) have shown that
7-oh-dpat is emetic in ferrets, an action attributed by
these authors to  xxxg657xxx  activation. our
results strongly suggest that  xxxg656xxx  stimulation likely contributes to the emetic activity of agents that
have been incorrectly classified as dopamine ‘‘d3-selective’’

217

agonists. a definitive conclusion on the emetogenicity of
 xxxg657xxx  stimulation awaits the development
of truly selective  xxxg657xxx  agonist.
in agreement with previously published results (andrews
et al., 1986; costall et al., 1989), apomorphine’s dose –
response curve with respect to emesis was bell-shaped. it
has been suggested that apomorphine-elicited emesis in
ferrets may depend on the rate of presentation of apomorphine to the area postrema since intravenously administered
apomorphine is less effective at producing emesis than
subcutaneously administered apomorphine (andrews et al.,
1986). of particular interest is that fact that dopaminergic
agonists produce biphasic dose – response relationships for
many endpoints, including locomotion, pain sensitivity,
penile erection, cardiovascular, endocrine and other biological responses (calabrese, 2001). as dose increases,
receptor selectivity of a given agonist likely decreases.
activation of related receptor subtypes (or perhaps even
pharmacologically unrelated receptors) could result in antiemetic activity that opposes the initial emetic stimulation by
dopamine receptor agonists. alternatively, higher drug
doses could result in greater drug penetration into hindbrain
structures, ultimately leading to anti-emetic activity through
agonist effects at a site downstream from the area postrema.
such a mechanism has been hypothesized for the emetic and
anti-emetic effects of opioid agonists in ferrets (thompson
et al., 1992).
the  xxxg658xxx  agonist pd168077 increases
locomotor activity in rats (nayak and cassaday, 2003), while
bernaerts and tirelli (2003) have demonstrated that
pd168077 increases mean step-through latency in mice,
suggesting involvement of dopamine d4 receptors in
memory consolidation. also, administration of pd168077
increases c-fos expression in rat striatum (trı́as et al., 2001).
perhaps even more intriguing is recent preclinical data that
suggest  xxxg658xxx  agonists may be clinically
useful for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (hsieh et al.,
2004; brioni et al., 2004). the pd168077 doses used in all of
these studies overlap the dose range used in the present work,
further underscoring the relevance of our finding that
dopamine d4 receptors are non-emetic. although apomorphine is currently marketed in europe for the treatment of
erectile dysfunction, nausea occasionally occurs with its use
(bukofzer and livesey, 2001). the data presented in the
current study suggest that apomorphine’s nauseogenic
activity results from dopamine d2 and/or  xxxg657xxx 
agonism. the recent demonstration that dopamine d4
receptor agonists induce penile erection in rats suggests
apomorphine’s pro-erectile activity may be mediated through
dopamine d4 receptors (hsieh et al., 2004; brioni et al.,
2004). the lack of emetogenicity of pd168077 and
cp226269, as well as the novel dopamine d4 agonist
abt-724 (brioni et al., 2004) indicates that non-emetic,
centrally-acting  xxxg658xxx  agonists may be a
valuable therapeutic approach for the treatment of erectile
dysfunction.

a significant advantage of our experimental approach is
that the same species (ferret) has been used for both in vivo
and in vitro characterization, eliminating potential crossspecies confounds. moreover, the similarity between human
and ferret dopamine receptor pharmacology, with respect to
ligand-binding and in vitro functional activity (moreland et
al., 2004), provides additional credibility for the choice of
ferrets for preclinical emesis testing (king, 1990). a further
benefit emanating from these studies is the potential for
reduction in animal use by pre-screening novel chemical
entities in the in vitro dopamine receptor assays, reserving in
vivo studies only for those compounds lacking activity at
dopamine d2l receptors. in summary, these studies indicate
that activation of dopamine d2 receptors, but not dopamine
d4 receptors, is related to the emetic properties of dopamine
agonists.
