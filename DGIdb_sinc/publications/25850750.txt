abstract
purpose targeting the prostacyclin pathway is an effective
treatment option for pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah).
patients with pah have a deficiency of prostacyclin and
 xxxg1880xxx .  xxxd3188xxx  is an orally available and
selective  xxxg1879xxx  ( xxxg1879xxx ) agonist.  xxxd3188xxx  is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite act-333679, also
a selective and potent agonist at the  xxxg1879xxx .
methods in this phase i study the pharmacokinetics (pk)
and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of
 xxxd3188xxx  were investigated in a double-blind, placebocontrolled manner in 64 healthy male subjects. an additional group of 12 subjects received an open-label dose of
 xxxd3188xxx  400 lg in the fasted condition and after a meal.
results maximum plasma concentrations of  xxxd3188xxx 
and act-333679 were reached within 2.5 and 4 h, respectively, with mean half-lives of 0.7–2.3 and
9.4–14.22 h. in the presence of food, exposure to act333679 was decreased by 27 %. the most frequent adverse
event was headache.  xxxd3188xxx  was well tolerated up to a
single dose of 400 lg and multiple doses of 600 lg following an up-titration step. no relevant treatment-related
effects on vital signs, clinical laboratory, and electrocardiogram (ecg) parameters were detected.
conclusion  xxxd3188xxx  exhibits a good tolerability profile
and pk properties that warrant further investigation.

key points
orally administered  xxxd3188xxx  is in development for
the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension
(pah).  xxxd3188xxx  targets the prostacyclin pathway,
one of the key pathways involved in the pathology of
pah.
in this phase i study,  xxxd3188xxx  was well tolerated in
healthy male subjects receiving both single oral
doses up to 400 lg and multiple oral doses of twicedaily 600 lg (following up-titration from 400 lg).
tolerability was improved when the drug was uptitrated in steps.
the drug pharmacokinetic profile supports that
 xxxd3188xxx  should be taken twice daily with food.

1 introduction
pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a hemodynamic
and pathophysiological condition affecting the pulmonary
arterioles and characterized by progressive increases in
pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, ultimately leading to right heart failure and premature
death [1, 2]. recent therapeutic options have significantly
improved the long-term outcome of patients with pah, but
pah remains a disease with a poor prognosis [3–5].
reduced expression of prostacyclin synthases in the
lung and reduced levels of prostacyclin are key features of
pah [6–8]. prostacyclin is produced by endothelial cells
from prostaglandin h2 (pgh2) by the enzyme prostacyclin

196

synthase [6]. prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and also
has anti-proliferative, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory effects [8, 9]. as pah is associated with vasoconstriction, proliferation, and thrombosis, there is a strong
rationale for using prostacyclin treatment [1, 2, 10].
restoration of  xxxg1879xxx  signaling using  xxxg1879xxx  ( xxxg1879xxx ) agonists is an effective strategy in the
treatment of the disease.
although beneficial effects of prostacyclins such as
epoprostenol have been documented, their clinical application remains cumbersome due to limited stability and a
very short half-life of 3–5 min [11] as well as the need for
continuous intravenous (iv) infusion. complex delivery
systems are required that are associated with adverse and
potentially serious complications. these may hamper dose
titration and may lead to discontinuation of treatment [12,
13]. epoprostenol was the first targeted pah therapy to be
approved, and improved the prognosis of patients with
pah [11, 14, 15]. several prostacyclin analogs have been
synthesized since, with different modes of application, including subcutaneous, inhaled, and oral. alternatives to
epoprostenol include  xxxd3415xxx  and  xxxd2331xxx  in the usa
and some european countries and  xxxd319xxx  in japan and
korea.
 xxxd3188xxx  (previously known as  xxxd3188xxx  or act293987) (fig. 1) is a novel orally available selective ip
receptor agonist.  xxxd3188xxx  is rapidly absorbed after oral
administration and hydrolyzed to the pharmacologically
more active metabolite act-333679 (previously known as
mre-269) [16]. act-333679 is considered as the major
contributor to the overall activity of the drug. a single-dose

p. kaufmann et al.

study of oral  xxxd3188xxx  (100 lg) conducted in five healthy
male subjects showed that it was metabolized to act333679, which has an elimination half-life in the human
body of 7.9 h [17]. although it acts through the prostacyclin pathway,  xxxd3188xxx  is chemically distinct from
prostacyclin analogs and has a high selectivity for the human  xxxg1879xxx  over other receptors [17].
the aim of the present study was to assess the pharmacokinetics (pk) of single ascending doses (sad) and
multiple ascending doses (mad) of  xxxd3188xxx  in healthy
male subjects. in addition, the effect of food on pk and
tolerability was evaluated.

2 methods
2.1 subjects
the protocol was approved by the research ethics committee at st thomas’ hospital (london, uk). written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. the study
was conducted in full compliance with the principles of the
declaration of helsinki and with laws and regulations of
the uk, where the research study was conducted. the
medicine and health care products regulatory agency
(mhra) of the uk reviewed and approved the study before any activity commenced.
the study population included non-smoking healthy
male subjects of any ethnic origin aged between 18 and
45 years, with a body mass index (bmi) between 19 and
30 kg/m2. subjects were assessed to be healthy on the basis
of screening examinations. for recruitment, the subjects
were to have normal physical examination findings, vital
signs, laboratory values, and 12-lead electrocardiogram
(ecg) results during screening, as well as no history or
evidence of alcohol or drug abuse. subjects who reported
the use of another investigational drug, smoking, or donation of blood within 3 months prior to first dosing were
excluded from the study.
2.2 study design

fig. 1 chemical structures of  xxxd3188xxx  and its metabolite act333679

the sad and mad studies were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase i studies
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pk of  xxxd3188xxx  and
act-333679, whereas the food effect was evaluated in an
open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study.
subjects who were deemed eligible (based on screening,
inclusion and exclusion criteria) were admitted to the site
in the evening of the day before the start of treatment
(day 1). they were tested for any evidence of consumption
or abuse of alcohol or drugs and were assigned the randomization code number for the corresponding study

pharmacokinetics and tolerability of  xxxd3188xxx 

treatment group. within each group of the sad and mad
part, subjects were randomly allocated to  xxxd3188xxx  or
placebo. dose escalation to the next treatment group was
performed following satisfactory review of the safety and
tolerability of the preceding dose groups.
in the sad study, subjects were enrolled: eight subjects
each participated in one of five treatment groups (100, 200,
400, 600, and 800 lg dose groups), in which six and two
subjects per dose group were randomized to active
medication and placebo, respectively. in all dose groups,
subjects received the study drug in the fasted state in the
morning of treatment day 1. the subjects remained under
observation at the study site for 48 h after administration of
the study drug and were discharged after all study assessments were completed (i.e., in the morning of day 3). a
post-treatment follow-up visit was performed on day 7 for
adverse event (ae) review, medical history update, and
clinical laboratory safety tests. the dose used to study the
food effect was selected based on the safety and tolerability
results of the sad study. in period 1, a total of 12 subjects
received a single dose of 400 lg after an overnight fast of
at least 10 h or following a high-fat breakfast given 30 min
pre-dose [18]. in period 2, the same subjects received the
study medication in the alternative condition to period 1.
the dosing in both periods was separated by at least
7 days. the subjects remained under observation at the
study site for 48 h after administration of the study drug. a
post-treatment follow-up visit was performed on day 7 for
ae review, medical history update, and clinical laboratory
safety tests.
in the mad study, 24 healthy male subjects were studied
in three groups of eight subjects each (six receiving active
drug and two receiving placebo) in one of three treatment
groups (200 lg, 400 lg, up-titration scheme from 400 to
600 lg dose groups). in the morning of day 1, a single oral
dose of  xxxd3188xxx  or placebo was administered; no study
drug was administered on day 2. on days 3–7, treatment
was twice daily, followed by a single dose of  xxxd3188xxx  or
placebo in the morning of day 8. subjects in the 400/600 lg
up-titration group received a single oral dose of  xxxd3188xxx 
400 lg or placebo in the morning of day 1. no study drug
was administered on day 2. subsequently, on days 3–4,
 xxxd3188xxx  400 lg or placebo was administered twice daily,
followed by  xxxd3188xxx  600 lg or placebo twice daily on
days 5–7, and then a single dose of  xxxd3188xxx  600 lg or
placebo in the morning of day 8. all doses were administered within 5 min after breakfast or dinner. based on the
results of the food-effect study, investigators decided to
administer  xxxd3188xxx  in the mad part of the study in the fed
state. subjects resided at the study site until the morning of
day 10 (48 h after last dose). a follow-up visit for ae
review, medical history update, and clinical laboratory
safety tests was performed on day 17.

2.3 safety and tolerability
subjects were monitored for safety and tolerability
throughout the study. assessments were based on recording
of aes as well as physical examination, vital signs, ecgs,
and clinical laboratory tests, performed at screening and
periodically after dosing.
2.4 sample collection and bio-analysis
plasma and urine samples were collected for measurement
of  xxxd3188xxx  and act-333679 concentrations. validated
liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (lc–ms/ms) assays specific for measurement of
the unchanged compound as well as the metabolite were
used. the lower limit of quantification (lloq) was
0.01 ng/ml for both analytes in plasma and urine.
to 600 ll of acidified plasma (containing 10 % of 1 m
hydrochloric acid) or acidified urine, 50 ll of internal
standard solution (mre-282, methanol as solvent), 500 ll
of 1 %  xxxd2154xxx , and 50 ll of methanol were added. the
samples were loaded onto a solid-phase extraction cartridge (oasis hlb 60 mg/3 cc, waters corporation,
milford, ma, usa), washed, and eluted with methanol
6 ml. after evaporation of eluted solutions under a stream
of nitrogen gas heated to a maximum temperature of 40 °c,
the residues were reconstituted in 200 ll of solvent (ultrapure water and methanol mixed in a 50:50 ratio), centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 2 min, 4 °c), and 20 ll of the
supernatant was injected onto the lc–ms/ms. the chromatographic system consisted of a pump, a column
(develosil c30-ug-5 2 mm 9 150 mm, 5 lm particle
size, nomura chemical co. ltd., seto, japan), and a guard
filter (rheodyne column inlet filter 3 mm diameter frit
rheodyne, co. ltd, rohnert park, ca, usa). mobile
phases consisted of methanol/ xxxd2154xxx  0.1 %
(85:15 vol/vol). mass spectrometric detection was performed with a turbo ion spray operating in positive-ion
mode at 600 °c. samples were quantified using peak area
ratios.
quality control (qc) samples were analyzed, and their
measured concentrations were used to determine betweenrun, overall precision, and accuracy of the analyses. the
inter-batch coefficients of variation of qc samples were
between 3.7 and 12.2 % for  xxxd3188xxx  and between 3.9 and
10.6 % for act-333679, whereas the inter-batch accuracies were in the range of 97.5–107.9 % for  xxxd3188xxx  and
95.2–102.0 % for act-333679.
in the sad and the food-effect studies, blood samples
were collected into lithium-heparin tubes on day 1 prior to
dosing, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24,
36, and 48 h post-dose. a similar schedule of blood sampling was applied in the mad study for day 1 and 2 (first

198

36 h post-dose only) and on day 8–10, whereas blood was
sampled every morning immediately before dosing between days 3 and 7. within 30 min of collection, blood
samples were centrifuged, plasma was transferred into new
polypropylene tubes, and 10 % of 1 m hydrochloric acid
was added. all samples were stored in an upright position
at -20 °c or below.
urine samples were collected into polyethylene containers over the following time intervals: pre-dose, 0–12,
12–24, and 24–48 h post-dose for the sad study and
0–48 h post-dose on day 1 and day 8 for the mad study.
hydrochloric acid (100 ml of 1.0 m hcl) was added to
each container before urine collection commenced. during
each collection period, the contents were stored in a refrigerator at approximately 4 °c. at the end of each collection period, the total volume was measured, and urine
aliquots were stored at approximately -20 °c.
2.5 data analysis and statistical results
pharmacokinetic analyses were performed to determine the
plasma pk parameters and the total excretion of  xxxd3188xxx 
and act-333679 in urine. individual plasma concentrations were analyzed using winnonlinò 4.1.b software and
the pk parameters per subject were derived.
dose proportionality was assessed for  xxxd3188xxx  and
act-333679 across doses for maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and area under plasma concentration–time
curve from 0 to infinity (auc0–?) or aucs values using a
power model [19]. a point estimate and 95 % confidence
interval (ci) were produced for the population mean slope.
non-dose proportionality was established if the 95 % ci
for the slope excluded 1.
the effect of food on the pk of a single dose of  xxxd3188xxx  400 lg was investigated using a mixed-effects
analysis of variance model, with fixed-effect terms for
sequence, treatment, and period and a random effect for
subject, which was fitted to the data using proc mixed
in the statistical package sas. the primary pk parameters
cmax and auc0–? of  xxxd3188xxx  and act-333679 were
logarithmically transformed prior to statistical analysis.
the 90 % ci of the ratio of geometric means for the
variables cmax and auc0–? was calculated comparing fed
versus fasted. no effect of food was concluded when the
90 % ci was entirely within the bioequivalence interval of
0.80–1.25.
concentrations below the lloq prior to cmax were
taken as zero, and those observed after cmax were excluded
from the analysis.
statistical analysis system (sasò) software, version
8.2 (sas institute, cary, nc, usa) was used for all statistical analysis.

3 results
3.1 demographics and baseline characteristics
in the sad study, 40 healthy male subjects were randomized (29 caucasian, six black, three asian, one hispanic, and one ‘other’). the age range was 19–44 years,
and the bmi was 21–30 kg/m2.
in the mad study, 24 healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 34 years (22 caucasian, two asian) were
enrolled, with a bmi of 20–30 kg/m2.
in the food-effect study, 12 healthy subjects (seven
caucasian, three asian, one hispanic, and one black) aged
between 19 and 44 years were enrolled, with a bmi of
19–27 kg/m2.
all except two subjects completed the study. one subject within the food-effect study discontinued the study
prematurely as a result of increased liver enzymes of less
than two times the upper limit of normal, probably due to
alcohol intake during the washout period. this subject was
not replaced. a subject in the mad study, who withdrew
consent post-dose on day 1, was replaced.
3.2 safety and tolerability
across all three studies, a total of 113 treatment-emergent
aes were reported by 43 of the 77 subjects included in the
safety analysis. overall, the most frequently reported ae
was headache.  xxxd3188xxx  was well tolerated in the sad
study at the 100, 200, and 400 lg dose levels, at all dose
levels in the mad study, and in the food-effect study. aes
occurred with increasing frequency and intensity at single
doses beyond 400 lg.
no clinically relevant effects of treatment with  xxxd3188xxx  on mean clinical laboratory parameters, ecg
recordings, physical examination, and vital sign values
were observed. no aes related to clinical laboratory
variables, ecg recordings, or physical examination were
recorded. there were no serious aes. the majority of aes
resolved spontaneously without sequelae. one incident of
procedural site reaction, rash, and nasal congestion in the
mad study had not resolved at follow-up. summaries of
the aes reported during the sad and mad parts of the
study, including those aes judged to be unrelated to study
drug, are provided in tables 1 and 2.
in the sad study, 16 of the 40 subjects reported aes, 12
(40 %) subjects after administration of  xxxd3188xxx  and four
(40 %) subjects after administration of placebo. the most
frequent treatment-emergent ae was headache, with nine
subjects across the different  xxxd3188xxx  dose groups, and
none in the placebo group. six subjects reported nausea:

ae(s) adverse event(s)

one in the placebo group. the incidence and intensity increased at doses higher than 400 lg. all subjects who received  xxxd3188xxx  800 lg reported at least one ae.
 xxxd3188xxx  was well tolerated by the subjects participating in the food study. nine treatment-emergent aes were
reported by six of the 12 subjects. two subjects (17 %)
reported aes in the fed period and five subjects (45 %) in
the fasted period. one subject was withdrawn before period
2 dosing because of increased hepatic enzymes of less than
two times the upper limit of normal, probably due to alcohol consumption during the washout period.
multiple doses of  xxxd3188xxx  were well tolerated at the
200, 400, and 400 lg/600 lg dose levels. a total of 66
treatment-emergent aes were reported by 20 of the 25

subjects, of whom 15 (79 %) received  xxxd3188xxx  and five
(83 %) received placebo. there was no consistent trend in
the number of aes with increasing doses of  xxxd3188xxx , and
the incidence of aes per subject was similar for all treatment groups.
3.3 plasma pharmacokinetics
the pk parameters determined in the sad and mad study
are reported in tables 3 and 4, respectively.
following single oral administration of  xxxd3188xxx  under
fasted conditions, peak plasma concentrations were
achieved within 2 h, with no concentrations above
15.66 ng/ml. the mean plasma concentration–time profiles

fasted state

different dose groups. the maximum plasma concentrations of the metabolite were achieved between 2.25 and
2.75 h post-dose, with no concentration above 17.84 ng/
ml. the terminal half-life of act-333679 was longer than
that of  xxxd3188xxx , with means of between 9.4 and 12.6 h in
the different dose groups. the exposure to act-333679
was approximately fourfold higher than with  xxxd3188xxx .
analysis of the data for dose proportionality showed that
the 95 % ci of  xxxd3188xxx  and act-333679 for the slope
included 1 for both cmax and auc0–?, suggesting an approximate dose-proportional increase in both parameters
across the doses tested (data not shown).
in the presence of food, the mean auc0–? for  xxxd3188xxx 
and act-333679 was, on average, 10 % higher and 27 %
lower, respectively, whereas the median time to cmax increased from 1.00 and 2.50 h in the fasted state to 2.75 and
4.00 h in the fed state, respectively. the ratios of geometric
means (90 % ci) for fed/fasted conditions for cmax were
0.65 (0.48–0.88) and for auc0–? 1.10 (0.92–1.30) for
 xxxd3188xxx  and 0.52 (0.41–0.65) and 0.73 (0.65–0.81) for the
active metabolite, respectively.

dose group); in the fed state

administration in all dose groups are shown in fig. 3. the
observed and calculated pk variables on day 1 and 8 for
both parent compound and metabolite are shown in
table 2. the accumulation factors for  xxxd3188xxx , as estimated by the geometric mean ratio of aucs on day 8 and
auc0–12h on day 1 were 0.92 and 0.79 after 200 and
400 lg, respectively. the accumulation factors for act333679 were 1.27 and 1.02 after 200 and 400 lg  xxxd3188xxx ,
respectively. based on visual inspection of the mean trough
concentrations of  xxxd3188xxx  and act-333679, concentrations on day 8 were at steady state (data not shown). the
results of the dose-proportionality testing for  xxxd3188xxx 
using the power model assessment of day 8 aucs and
cmax versus dose indicated a slope (95 % ci) of 0.85
(0.59–1.12) and 0.98 (0.61–1.34), respectively. the 95 %
ci for both variables included 1, indicating dose-proportional pk of  xxxd3188xxx  in the dose range tested. for act333679, the results of the power model assessments
showed that the slope and the 95 % ci were 0.85
(0.51–1.18) and 0.64 (0.31–0.97) for cmax and aucs, respectively. this indicates a dose-proportional increase in
rate of exposure and a slight deviation from dose proportionality in extent of exposure to the active metabolite.

3.4 urine pharmacokinetics
 xxxd3188xxx  could not be detected in urine, whereas act333679 was detected for doses of 200 lg and higher. the
active metabolite was mainly excreted during the first 12 h
after dose, and the total amount excreted increased with
increasing  xxxd3188xxx  doses. the fraction of the administered  xxxd3188xxx  dose excreted as act-333679 in urine was
below 0.12 % for all dose groups.

4 discussion
overall, single doses of  xxxd3188xxx  given after overnight
fasting were well tolerated at the 100, 200, and 400 lg
dose levels. single doses of  xxxd3188xxx  were less well tolerated at the 600 and 800 lg dose levels due to increasing
incidence and severity of aes such as headache, nausea,
dizziness, and vomiting. multiple doses of  xxxd3188xxx  were
well tolerated at the 200 lg, 400 lg, and 400/600 lg twice
daily dose levels. interestingly, flushing, a relatively
common side effect of intravenous epoprostenol [11, 20],
was not reported by any subject receiving  xxxd3188xxx .
likewise, no symptomatic hypotension was reported.
a dosing regimen of 600 lg  xxxd3188xxx  twice daily was
well tolerated during the mad part of the study following
up-titration from 400 lg, whereas 600 lg  xxxd3188xxx  as a
single dose without prior up-titration was less well tolerated following a single dose in the sad study. this suggests improved tolerability after repeated dosing. gradual
dose up-titration is a common treatment regimen for drugs
addressing the prostacyclin pathway, including epoprostenol (iv),  xxxd3415xxx  (oral, iv, subcutaneous, and inhaled),
and  xxxd2331xxx  (inhaled), which leads to individualized dosing
for each patient based on the symptoms of the disease and
tolerability of  xxxg1879xxx  agonists [21, 22]. this is of
particular relevance as a clinical study on a subcutaneously
administered prostacyclin analog suggested that patients
who tolerate a higher dose of these drugs achieve greater
improvement in disease markers such as exercise capacity
[23].
based on auc and cmax, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3188xxx  were dose proportional over the tested dose range
after single- and multiple-dose administration. overall,
after single- and multiple-dose administration, the plasma
concentration–time profiles of  xxxd3188xxx  were characterized
by fast absorption (time to cmax [tmax] approximately 1 h
after drug administration) and an apparent mean elimination
half-life of 0.7–2.3 h in the different dose groups. the active metabolite act-333679 is rapidly formed and more
slowly eliminated, with a mean elimination half-life of
9.4–14.2 h. these data are comparable to those obtained in
a previous single-dose study [17].

p. kaufmann et al.

the apparent dose-dependent increase in half-life could
be explained by a longer time period above lloq and
enabled capturing the actual elimination phase at higher
doses that was not detectable at lower doses. the low
urinary concentrations of unchanged  xxxd3188xxx  or act333679 indicate that this compound is mainly eliminated
via the hepatobiliary route, but urinary excretion of other
metabolites cannot be excluded.
exposure to the metabolite exceeded that of the parent
compound by a factor of approximately four. as act333679 is a more potent  xxxg1879xxx  agonist in both receptor affinity and functional assays [17, 24], it is expected
to be the major contributor to the pharmacological activity
of  xxxd3188xxx . within the multiple-dose regimen, no accumulation was measured in plasma on day 8. steady-state
conditions had been attained within 8 days of twice-daily
dosing. the observed pk profile of  xxxd3188xxx  and its
metabolite is consistent with twice-daily oral dosing, which
is a regimen that has resulted in good patient compliance
when compared with more frequent dosing regimens [25]
or with other routes of administration [26, 27].
compared with the fasted state, food decreased the rate
of absorption of  xxxd3188xxx , shown by a decrease in cmax and
a delay in median tmax. food had no significant effect on the
extent of exposure to  xxxd3188xxx , whereas exposure to the
active metabolite was reduced by 27 %; however, with the
sample size chosen for this exploratory study, the lower or
upper limits of the 90 % ci for cmax of  xxxd3188xxx  and auc
and cmax of act-333679 were not within the limits for
absence of a food effect. it is interesting to note that more
subjects reported aes in the fasted period (45 % of subjects) than in the fed period (17 % of subjects), suggesting
better tolerability when  xxxd3188xxx  is administered with food.

5 conclusion
data from the sad and mad studies of  xxxd3188xxx  show
single oral doses of up to 400 lg  xxxd3188xxx  and twice-daily
multiple oral doses of 600 lg following up-titration from
400 lg  xxxd3188xxx  were well tolerated by healthy male
subjects. tolerability was improved following an up-titration scheme. the pk profile supports twice-daily dosing
taken with food. further investigations to achieve higher
dose levels following an up-titration regimen are warranted.
