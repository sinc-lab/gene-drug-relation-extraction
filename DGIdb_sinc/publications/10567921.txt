functional significance of globotriaosyl ceramide in interferon-alpha(2)/type 1  xxxg1139xxx -mediated antiviral activity.  the n-terminus of the type 1  xxxg1139xxx  subunit,  xxxg1138xxx , has high amino acid sequence similarity to the receptor binding b subunit of the escherichia coli-derived verotoxin 1, vt1. the glycolipid, globotriaosyl ceramide (gb(3): gal alpha(1) --> 4 gal beta 1 --> 4 glu beta 1 --> 1 cer) is the specific cell receptor for vt1. gb(3)-deficient variant cells selected for vt resistance are cross-resistant to interferon-alpha ( xxxg1137xxx )-mediated antiproliferative activity. the association of eifnar1 with gal alpha 1 --> 4 gal containing glycolipids has been previously shown to be important for the receptor-mediated  xxxg1137xxx  signal transduction for growth inhibition. the crucial role of gb(3) for the signal transduction of  xxxg1137xxx -mediated antiviral activity is now reported.  xxxg1137xxx -mediated antiviral activity, nuclear translocation of activated stat1, and increased expression of pkr were defective in gb(3)-deficient vero mutant cells, although the surface expression of  xxxg1138xxx  was unaltered. the vt1b subunit was found to inhibit  xxxg1137xxx -mediated antiviral activity, stat1 nuclear translocation and pkr upregulation. unlike vt1 cytotoxicity,  xxxg1137xxx -induced stat1 nuclear translocation was not inhibited when rme was prevented, suggesting that the accessory function of gb(3) occurs at the plasma membrane.  xxxg1137xxx  antiviral activity was also studied in gb(3)-positive mrc-5 cells, which are resistant to  xxxg1137xxx  growth inhibition, partially resistant to vt1 but still remain fully sensitive to  xxxg1137xxx  antiviral activity, and two astrocytoma cell lines expressing different gb(3) fatty acid isoforms. in both systems, long chain fatty acid-containing gb(3) isoforms, which are less effective to mediate vt1 cytotoxicity, were found to correlate with higher  xxxg1137xxx -mediated antiviral activity. inhibition of gb(3) synthesis in toto prevented  xxxg1137xxx  antiviral activity in all cells. we propose that the long chain gb(3) fatty isoforms preferentially remain in the plasma membrane, and by associating with  xxxg1138xxx , mediate  xxxg1137xxx  antiviral signaling, whereas short chain gb(3) fatty acid isoforms are preferentially internalized to mediate vt1 cytotoxicity and  xxxg1138xxx -dependent  xxxg1137xxx  growth inhibition.
