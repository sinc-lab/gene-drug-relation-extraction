1 human gabaa receptors containing dierent a and b subunits with or without the g2s or g2l
subunits were expressed in xenopus oocytes and the eects of the insecticides g- and dhexachlorocyclohexane (g- xxxd2488xxx  and d- xxxd2488xxx , respectively) on these receptor subunit combinations
were examined using two electrode voltage-clamp procedures.
2 g- xxxd2488xxx  produced incomplete inhibition of gaba responses on all receptor combinations
examined with anities in the range of 1.1 ± 1.9 mm. anity was not dependent on subunit
composition but the maximum percentage of inhibition was signi®cantly reduced in b1-containing
receptors.
3 d- xxxd2488xxx  both potentiated gabaa receptors and activated them in the absence of gaba at
concentrations higher than those producing potentiation. allosteric enhancement of gabaa
receptor function by d- xxxd2488xxx  was not aected by the subunit composition of the receptor, by
contrast the gaba mimetic actions of d- xxxd2488xxx  were abolished in receptors containing either a4, b1
or g2l subunits.
4 sensitivity to the direct actions were not restored in receptors containing the mutant b1(s290n)
subunit, but a1b2g2l receptors became sensitive to the direct actions of d- xxxd2488xxx  when oocytes were
treated for 24 h with the protein kinase inhibitor isoquinolinesulphonyl-2-methyl piperazine
dihydrochloride (h-7).
5 we have shown the in¯uence of various a, b and g subunits on the inhibitory, gaba mimetic
and allosteric eects of  xxxd2488xxx  isomers. the data reveal that neither the inhibitory actions of g- xxxd2488xxx 
nor the allosteric eects d- xxxd2488xxx  has a strict subunit dependency. by contrast, sensitivity to the direct
actions of d- xxxd2488xxx  are abolished in receptors containing a4, b1 or g2l subunits.

introduction
the g- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) receptor is the
major inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system, and
is involved in the control of many neurological states such as
vigilance, anxiety, wakefulness and seizures. molecular
biological studies have established that gabaa receptors
are hetero-oligomeric proteins composed of combinations of
dierent subunit peptides. in mammals, 20 gabaa receptor
subunits (a1 ± 6, b1 ± 4, g1 ± 3, d, e, p, y and r 1 ± 3) have been
cloned (barnard et al., 1998, bonnert et al., 1999). in
addition, alternative splice isoforms have been found for
some subunits, most notably for the g2 subunit (g2s and g2l)
(whiting et al., 1990).
gabaa receptors have binding sites for diverse allosteric
modulators including gaba, benzodiazepines, volatile and
intravenous anaesthetics, loreclezole, divalent ions and
neuroactive steroids. studies of recombinant gabaa
receptors have revealed the critical importance of subunit
composition for a number of pharmacological properties of

the gabaa receptor such as sensitivity to loreclezole,
etomidate, benzodiazepines (whiting et al., 1995) and
furosemide (korpi et al., 1995). for example, the type of a
subunit present determines whether gabaa receptor display
type i or type ii benzodiazepine pharmacology (pritchett et
al., 1989a; waord et al., 1993). the  xxxg220xxx  also
contributes to the gaba binding site (ebert et al., 1994),
in¯uences the ecacy of barbiturate receptor activation
(thompson et al., 1996; waord et al., 1996) and sensitivity
to furosemide (thompson et al., 1999). the b subunit
contributes to the gaba binding site (amin & weiss,
1993; hadingham et al., 1993) and determines the eects of
loreclezole (waord et al., 1994; wingrove et al., 1994) and
etomidate (uchida et al., 1995; hill-venning et al., 1997;
belleli et al., 1997). in addition, the b subunit probably
contributes to both barbiturate and propofol action (amin,
1999; pistis et al., 1999). the g subunit confers benzodiazepine sensitivity (pritchett et al., 1989b) and has a signi®cant
eect on the anity for gaba (sigel et al., 1990).
insecticides such as the cyclodienes (nagata & narahashi,
1994),  xxxd2488xxx  (nagata & narahashi, 1995;

206

p.d. maskell et al

aspinwall et al., 1997) and avermectins (payne & sunderland, 1993) also bind to the gabaa receptor, which leads
to receptor blockade and convulsions.  xxxd2488xxx  are of particular interest because they can either
inhibit or enhance the action of gaba depending on the
spatial orientation of the chloride atoms (pomeâs et al.,
1992; woodward et al., 1992; nagata & narahashi, 1995;
aspinwall et al., 1997). for example, g- xxxd2488xxx  (g- xxxd2488xxx , lindane) inhibits the gabaa receptor, an
eect that is probably mediated by binding at or near the
 xxxd2947xxx  site (aspinwall et al., 1997; waord et al.,
1999). in contrast the d- xxxd2488xxx  (d- xxxd2488xxx )
isomer is a positive allosteric modulator of the gabaa
receptor and at concentrations greater than 10 mm it can
directly activate gabaa receptors in a manner resembling
the gaba mimetic eects of barbiturate and propofol
(aspinwall et al., 1997). interestingly, g- xxxd2488xxx  behaves as a
partial  xxxd1422xxx  of the  xxxd2947xxx  site and d- xxxd2488xxx 
appears to interact with the barbitutate site or a site
overlapping this site (aspinwall et al., 1997; waord et al.,
1999). little is known about the in¯uence of receptor
subunit on the eects of insecticides on gabaa receptors,
which would aid the elucidation of the binding sites of
these substances on the gabaa receptor and their
relationship with the  xxxd2947xxx  and barbiturate sites. in
this paper, we describe the in¯uence of various receptor
subunits to the inhibitory, allosteric modulatory and gaba
mimetic eects of the  xxxd2488xxx  isomers.

methods
expression of human gabaa receptors in xenopus
oocytes
stage v and vi oocytes were isolated from adult female
xenopus laevis and the theca and epithelial cell layer were
removed mechanically with ®ne watchmaker forceps. follicle
cells were removed by 8 min incubation in type ia
collagenase (sigma, u.k.) (0.5 mg ml71) dissolved in
modi®ed barth's solution (mbs) of the following composition: (in mm): nacl 88; kcl 1;  xxxd2534xxx  0.82; ca(no3)2 0.33;
cacl2 0.41; nahco3 2.5; n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2ethanesulphonic acid (hepes) 10, ph 7.5) oocyte nuclei
were directly injected with 20 nl of sterile water containing
dierent combinations of human gabaa subunit cdnas
(20 ng ml71) engineered into expression vectors pcdm8 or
pcdnai/amp. oocytes were incubated for 24 to 48 h in
mbs supplemented with 10 international units per ml
penicillin; 10 mg ml71 streptomycin; 50 mg ml71  xxxd2193xxx 
and 90 mg ml71 theophylline. for recording, oocytes were
placed in a 50 ml bath and perfused with frog ringer solution
(in mm: nacl 115; kcl 2.5; cacl2 1.8; hepes 10, ph 7.6).
cells were impaled with two 0.6 ± 2.5 mo agarose-cushioned
electrodes containing 3 m kcl and were voltage clamped at
760 mv. drugs were applied to the perfusate and gaba
was applied to the peak of the response, which for most
oocytes was 30 s or less. after establishing a maximal
response to gaba using a 3 mm concentration, constant
responses to an ec20/50 were obtained. an ec20/50 was the
concentration of gaba that produced 20 or 50% of the
maximum response obtained for gaba. inhibition of the

g- and d- xxxd2488xxx  effects on human gabaa receptors

gaba response by g- xxxd2488xxx  or  xxxd2947xxx  was investigated
using an ec50 concentration, whereas the positive allosteric
eect of d- xxxd2488xxx  on gabaa receptors was examined with
an ec20 gaba concentration. at least a 3 min wash-out
period was allowed between each drug application to
prevent desensitization. concentration-response curves were
®tted using a non-linear ®tting protocol (prism 2.01,
graphpad, u.s.a.). the data were ®tted to the logistic
equation f(w)=bmax/[1+ec50/x)n], where bmax is the
response at the saturating concentration. ec50, the concentration of ligand producing half-maximal response; x,
the concentration of ligand; and n, the hill coecient. in the
case of g- xxxd2488xxx , reversal of inhibition was observed at
concentrations greater than 10 mm. data points showing
reversal of inhibition were ignored in the analysis; ®tting
such data is beyond the limits of the logistic equation. data
is presented as arithmetic means or geometric means, which
were calculated from data obtained from a number (n) of
dierent oocytes. the statistical signi®cance of dierences
between mean values was assessed by student's unpaired
two-tailed t-test or one-way analysis of variance (anova),
wherever appropriate. a p value of 50.05 was considered
statistically signi®cant.

drugs
drugs used were gaba (sigma, u.k.),  xxxd2947xxx  (sigma,
u.k.), g- and d- xxxd2488xxx  (sigma, u.k.) and pentobarbital
(sigma, u.k.) solutions of gaba and pentobarbital were
made in saline.  xxxd2947xxx  and  xxxd2488xxx  isomers were prepared
as 1071 m stocks in dmso. the highest concentration of
dmso vehicle perfusing the oocyte was 0.1%, which had no
eects on gaba induced currents. g- and d- xxxd2488xxx  were
soluble 4100 mm in frog ringer solution.

results
inhibition of recombinant gabaa receptors by g- xxxd2488xxx 
the eect of g- xxxd2488xxx  on gaba ec50 responses of oocytes
injected with various combinations of gabaa receptor
subunits (table 1) was examined using two-electrode
voltage clamp techniques. as shown in figures 1 and 2,
g- xxxd2488xxx  caused partial inhibition of gaba ec50 responses
in all receptors tested. inhibition by g- xxxd2488xxx  was dosedependent, giving a maximum inhibition that ranged from
31 to 64%, and gave no further inhibition at concentrations greater than 10 mm. the inhibitory eect of g- xxxd2488xxx 
was reversed at concentrations greater than 10 mm in all of
the receptor combinations studied except a1b1g2s and
a1b2g2l. (figures 1 and 2). the potency of g- xxxd2488xxx  was
similar on all subunits tested (between 1.1 to 1.9 mm; table
1). by contrast, the maximum percentage of inhibition of
gaba ec50 responses was signi®cantly aected by the type
of b subunit present, varying from 31.2% on a1b1g2s
receptors to 46.3% on a1b2g2s and 64.4% on a1b3g2s
receptors, respectively (table 1). maximum inhibition was
not aected signi®cantly by the type of  xxxg220xxx  present
(45% on a4b2g2s and 46.3% on a1b2g2s receptors,
respectively) or by presence or type of g (between 46 to
64%; table 1).

followed by an approximate ec50 concentration, subsequent

the bars.

the role of a, b and g2s subunits on inhibition of gaba
responses by  xxxd2947xxx 
in order to compare the subunit dependency of the
inhibition of the gabaa receptors by g- xxxd2488xxx  directly to
that of  xxxd2947xxx , we investigated the eect of the a1, a4,
b1-3 and g2s subunits on the inhibition of gaba ec50
responses by  xxxd2947xxx . the anity for the inhibition of
gaba ec50 responses by  xxxd2947xxx  was similar on all
receptor combinations tested (mean 0.4 mm, 0.4 ± 1 mm)
(table 2). although  xxxd2947xxx  appeared to have more
anity for a1b3g2s receptors (ec50 0.43 mm) the dierence
was not statistically signi®cant. in all receptors studied,
 xxxd2947xxx  gave maximum inhibition at 100 mm. these
results are in accord with studies of murine gabaa
receptors that have shown that  xxxd2947xxx  action is

potentiation of the gaba response by d- xxxd2488xxx 
the positive allosteric eects of d- xxxd2488xxx  were studied on
a(1,4)b2g2s, a1b(1,2,3)g2s, a1b2g2l and a1b2 receptors.
measurement of potentiation of gaba ec20 responses
included the direct activation component. as shown in
figure 3, d- xxxd2488xxx  caused a dose dependent potentiation of
gaba ec20 responses on all receptor tested. the type of a
subunit present did not in¯uence the ec50 or ecacy of dhch allosteric eects. table 3 shows the range of ec50 and
maximum inhibition values determined on a1b2g2s (ec50
16 mm, maximum potentiation 248%) and a4b2g2s (ec50
19.5 mm and maximum potentiation 231+%) receptors. the
presence or type of g subunit present did not in¯uence the
positive allosteric eect of d- xxxd2488xxx  on gaba ec20 responses.
both the ec50 and maximum potentiation of gaba ec20
responses were similar on a1b2g2s, a1b2g2l receptors and

a1b2 receptors (16.2 mm and 248%, 13.6 mm and 281%,
19.9 mm and 254%, respectively). by contrast, the b subunit
signi®cantly aected anity such that d- xxxd2488xxx  was less potent
on receptors containing the b1 subunit (figure 3, table 3).
however, the alteration of the b-subunit had no eect on the
ecacy of d- xxxd2488xxx  (table 3). the rank order of potency was
a1b1g2s 5a1b2g2s=a1b3g2s. neither the signi®cance pattern
nor the rank order of potency changed by omitting the direct
action of d- xxxd2488xxx  from the measurement of potentiation of
gaba ec20 responses (data not shown).

direct activation of the recombinant human gabaa
receptor by d- xxxd2488xxx 
previous studies have shown that the direct eect of d- xxxd2488xxx 
is not signi®cantly dierent in a1b3g2s or a6b3g2s receptors
(aspinwall et al., 1997). to further investigate the role of a
subunits we investigated the direct eects of d- xxxd2488xxx  on
a4b2g2s receptors. as shown in figure 4, table 4, the direct
eects of d- xxxd2488xxx  on a1b2g2s and a4b2g2s receptors diered
signi®cantly. in oocytes expressing a1b2g2s, d- xxxd2488xxx  evoked
dose-dependent currents with an ec50 value of 42.2 mm and
ecacy of 30.5%. however, the direct eect of d- xxxd2488xxx  was
almost abolished on a4b2g2s receptors, producing currents
that were only 5% of the maximal gaba response. these
results are comparable to those reported by waord et al.,
(1996), where a4-containing receptors were not directly
activated by pentobarbital or propofol.

effect of the b subunit on the direct actions of d- xxxd2488xxx 
the in¯uence of b subunits on the direct eect of d- xxxd2488xxx  was
studied on a1bg2s receptors containing b1, b2, or b3
subunits. d- xxxd2488xxx  induced dose-dependent currents in both
a1b2g2s and a1b3g2s receptors but not in b1 containing
receptors. table 4 shows that there were no signi®cant
dierences between the direct eects of d- xxxd2488xxx  on a1b2g2s
(30.5% of the maximum gaba response; ec50 42.2 mm) or
a1b3g2s (32.2% of the maximum gaba response; ec50
37.2 mm). however, on b1-containing (a1b1g2s) receptors, dhch had no signi®cant direct eects (ecacy 2.1%) (figure
4, table 4).
the data generated suggested that the presence of the b1
subunit abolished sensitivity to the gaba mimetic actions of

a1b2g2s recombinant gabaa receptors. (a) a maximum gaba

each point represents the arithmetic mean+s.e.mean of 6 ± 7
experiments and was calculated as a percentage increase of the
gaba ec20.

d- xxxd2488xxx . the exchange of a serine residue (s290) in the b1
subunit for an asparagine, which is found in the corresponding positions of the b2 and b3 subunits (n289 and n290,
respectively), confers sensitivity to both loreclezole (wingrove
et al., 1994) and etomidate (belleli et al., 1997) on receptors
containing the mutant b1 subunit and in¯uences direct
activation by etomidate (belleli et al., 1997). we investigated
therefore whether s290 also in¯uenced sensitivity to the direct
actions of d- xxxd2488xxx  by testing the eect of d- xxxd2488xxx  on
a1b1s290ng2s mutant receptors. d- xxxd2488xxx  did not activate
currents on a1b1(s290n)g2s mutant receptors in the absence
of gaba, suggesting that this amino acid does not confer
direct activation by d- xxxd2488xxx  (table 4).

the g subunit and the direct effects of d- xxxd2488xxx 
the role of the g2s-subunit on the direct eect of d- xxxd2488xxx  was
investigated by comparing a1b2 and a1b2g2s recombinant

human gabaa receptors. d- xxxd2488xxx  directly activated a1b2
with and ecacy of 35.5% and ec50 36.1 mm. these values
were not signi®cantly dierent from the anity and ecacy
observed on a1b2g2s receptors (42.2 mm and 30.5%,
respectively). by contrast, when the g2s subunit was replaced
by the g2l subunit the direct eects of d- xxxd2488xxx  were
abolished.
the eect of the g2l subunit on the gaba mimetic eects
of d- xxxd2488xxx  suggested that phosphorylation by protein kinase
c may be important for the activation of gabaa receptors
by d- xxxd2488xxx . to test that possibility we modi®ed the state of
phosphorylation of oocytes expressing a1b2g2l receptors.
after 48 h post-injection of cdnas oocytes were incubated
overnight in mbs medium containing 0.2 mm of the protein
kinase c inhibitor isoquinolinesulphonyl-2-methyl piperazine
dihydrochloride (h-7). as shown in figure 5a, 100 mm (a
concentration that activates 30.5% of maximal gaba
responses on a1b2g2s receptors) d- xxxd2488xxx  elicited responses
in oocytes treated with h-7 that were approximately 20% of
maximal gaba responses, restoring direct activation by dhch. treatment with h-7 did not modify the potentiating
eect of g- xxxd2488xxx  on a1b2g2l receptors (figure 5), which
suggests that protein kinase c-dependent phosphorylation
aects only the gaba mimetic actions of d- xxxd2488xxx .

discussion

figure 4 the eect of subunit isoform present within gabaa
receptors on the gaba mimetic action of d- xxxd2488xxx . (a) traces show
typical maximum responses for gaba and d- xxxd2488xxx  of an oocyte
injected with a1, b2 and g2s cdnas. to elicit maximum responses
the oocyte was superfused with 3 mm gaba or 100 mm d- xxxd2488xxx . (b)
concentration-response curves for the direct eect of d- xxxd2488xxx  on
oocytes expressing a1b2g2s, a4b2g2s, a1b1g2s, a1b3g2s, a1b2g2l,
a1b2 and the mutant a1b1 (s290n) g2s gabaa receptors. each
point represents the arithmetic mean+s.e.mean of 5 ± 7 experiments
and was calculated as a percentage of the response obtained with a
maximum concentration of gaba (3 mm).

the present study shows that using a wide range of receptor
gabaa receptor subtypes, g- xxxd2488xxx  and d- xxxd2488xxx  isomers
interact with gabaa receptors in an opposite fashion, to
either partially inhibit gaba-induced currents (g- xxxd2488xxx ), or
enhance sub-maximal gaba responses (d- xxxd2488xxx ). d- xxxd2488xxx 
also directly activates the receptor in a subtype dependent
manner. this study also reveals that at high concentrations of
g- xxxd2488xxx , the inhibition reverses, potentiating gaba induced
currents, which is again a subtype dependent phenomenon.
this potentiation may well be related to that observed with
the d-isomer.

figure 5 eects of phosphorylation on receptor activation by dhch in oocytes expressing a1b2g2l gabaa receptors. in (a) the
direct action of 100 mm d- xxxd2488xxx  is shown in either untreated oocytes
or those which have been incubated for 24 h in 0.2 mm
isoquinolinesulphonyl-2-methyl piperazine dihydrochloride (h-7), a
protein kinase c inhibitor. in (b) blockade of a1b2g2 receptors by
10 mm g- xxxd2488xxx  is shown in both untreated oocytes and h-7
preincubated oocytes. each bar represents the mean+s.e.mean of
8 ± 10 oocytes tested. oocytes were from at least three dierent donor
frogs.

the potency of g- xxxd2488xxx  and  xxxd2947xxx  appear to be
relatively unaected by both a and g2s subunits. the type of
b subunit present does not aect  xxxd2947xxx  action, although
it in¯uences maximum inhibition of gaba ec50 responses
by g- xxxd2488xxx . however, this eect, as discussed in the previous
paragraph, may be a consequence of potentiation of gabaa
receptor function by g- xxxd2488xxx , which is in¯uenced by the type
of b subunit present, rather than from a direct eect on the
inhibitory action of g- xxxd2488xxx . thus, neither  xxxd2947xxx  nor ghch block of gabaa receptors appear to be aected by
receptor subunit composition, which support our early view
that g- xxxd2488xxx  and  xxxd2947xxx  interact with the same site on
gabaa receptors. additional evidence for this hypothesis
comes from electrophysiological studies that showed that ghch induces a dose-dependent rightward shift in the
 xxxd2947xxx  dose-response curve (aspinwall et al., 1997).
furthermore g- xxxd2488xxx  also displaces 35s-tert-butylbycyclophosphorothionate (35s-tbps) binding to mouse ®broblast cell
lines expressing human gabaa receptors (aspinwall et al.,
1997) and neuronal membranes (pomeâs et al., 1992). in
addition, mutations in the tm2 residue a302 in the

g- and d- xxxd2488xxx  effects on human gabaa receptors

drosophila rdl receptor reduces sensitivity to both  xxxd2947xxx 
and g- xxxd2488xxx  (zhang et al., 1994; belleli et al., 1995). thus,
overall the  xxxd1422xxx  model of activity seems ®rmly
supported by empirical evidence.
similar to several other allosteric modulators, in addition
to enhancing gaba responses, d- xxxd2488xxx  possess gabamimetic activity at concentrations greater than those required
for potentiation of sub-maximal gaba responses. a range
of structurally unrelated compounds also displays both
allosteric and gaba mimetic actions, including barbiturates
(thompson et al., 1996), etomidate (uchida et al., 1995; hillvenning et al., 1997), loreclezole (waord et al., 1994),
propofol (sanna et al., 1995) and alphaxalone (belleli et al.,
1996). it is still unclear whether this mimetic eect is
mediated via a distinct locus, or through the same binding
site. evidence for a separate locus comes from studies of
a4b1g2s receptors (waord et al., 1994), which are enhanced
by pentobarbitone but lack sensitivity to the direct actions of
the anaesthetic. moreover, in the drosophila rdl the
exchange of a methionine residue (m314) in tm2 for a
serine (the equivalent position in gabaa b1 subunit) confers
sensitivity to the direct actions of barbiturates (pistis et al.,
1999). this study provides additional support for separate
allosteric and gaba mimetic sites because receptor
combinations that were insensitive to the gaba mimetic
eects of d- xxxd2488xxx  (a4b2g2s, a1b1g2s and a1b2g2l) were
sensitive to the positive allosteric eects of d- xxxd2488xxx .
the type of a and b subunits present in recombinant
gabaa receptors in¯uence the potency and ecacy of the
gaba mimetic action of d- xxxd2488xxx . there is no signi®cant
dierence in the sensitivity of a1 (this study) or a6 (aspinwall
et al., 1997) containing bg2s receptors, but a4 containing b2/
3g2s receptors are insensitive to the direct actions of d- xxxd2488xxx .
the a4b1g2s receptor combination is also insensitive to the
direct actions of both pentobarbital and propofol (waord et
al., 1996). the a4 subunit is most closely related to the a6
subunit, which is, however, highly sensitive to the direct
actions of barbiturates (thompson et al., 1996; waord et
al., 1996) and propofol (waord et al., 1996). residues in
tm2 (belleli et al., 1999; pistis et al., 1999) and  xxxg2318xxx  (amin,
1999) have been found to confer sensitivity to the gaba
mimetic barbiturate. it is however unlikely that tm2 residues
in the a4 subunit in¯uence sensitivity to the direct actions of
barbiturates, propofol or d- xxxd2488xxx  because the tm2 domain in
a4 and a6 subunits are identical (waord et al., 1996).
b1-containing receptors were insensitive to the gaba
mimetic eects of d- xxxd2488xxx , although on b2- and b3-containing
receptors d- xxxd2488xxx  activated currents with comparable potency
and ecacy. this is in contrast to the gaba activation by
pentobarbital, which is not abolished in the presence of the
b1 subunit, although the anity and ecacy of barbiturate
direct actions is lower at a1b1g2s receptors than those
containing b2 or b3 subunits (thompson et al., 1996). thus,
d- xxxd2488xxx  may still bind to a site for direct activation on b1containing gabaa receptors and activate the transduction
mechanism but with a signi®cantly reduced anity and
ecacy.
residue s290 in the b1 subunit reduces sensitivity to the
anti-convulsant loreclezole (waord et al., 1994; wingrove et
al., 1994) and the anaesthetic etomidate (belleli et al., 1997).
s290n did not aect the gaba mimetic eects of
barbiturates (pistis et al., 1999), and in this report does not

p.d. maskell et al

aect the direct eect of d- xxxd2488xxx . these data support our
view of a related gaba-mimetic barbiturate/d- xxxd2488xxx  site.
the role of the g-subunit is intriguing. so far, this subunit
has not been found to aect signi®cantly the direct actions of
barbiturates or loreclezole. however, a signi®cant increase in
the ecacy of propofol has been noted with the removal of
the g2l-subunit (lam & reynolds, 1998) and both a3b1g2l
and a6b3g2l receptors are insensitive to the direct actions of
d- xxxd2488xxx  (pistis et al., 1999). the g2l and g2s subunits are
identical with the exception of an eight-amino acid segment
containing a unique protein kinase c phosphorylation site
(whiting et al., 1990). it has been suggested that this unique
phosphorylation site may aect the coupling between
allosteric sites (leidenheimer et al., 1993). in the case of

the gaba mimetic eects of barbiturates and d- xxxd2488xxx , the
site may in¯uence anity and/or ecacy.
our results con®rm that  xxxd2488xxx  isomers act at distinct sites
on gabaa receptors to inhibit, enhance or activate gabaa
receptor function. the pattern of subunit dependency for the
three eects supports our view that inhibition of gaba
function by g- xxxd2488xxx  is mediated via the  xxxd2947xxx  binding
site, whereas the gaba-mimetic and allosteric eects of dhch is mediated via the barbiturate gaba-mimetic and
allosteric sites, respectively.

the authors would like to thank paul whiting and peter wingrove
for the gaba cdnas.
