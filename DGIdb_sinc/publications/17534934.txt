abstract
we have recently described large, unipolar neurons (named bullwhip cells) that regulate
the proliferation of progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (cmz) of the postnatal
chicken retina (fischer et al. [2005] j. neurosci. 25:10157–10166; [2006] j. comp.  xxxd122xxx .
496:479 – 494). there are only about 240 bullwhip cells in the entire retina, and these cells are
easily identiﬁed by their unique morphology and immunoreactivity for glucagon, glucagonlike peptide 1 ( xxxg873xxx ), and  xxxg2240xxx . the purpose of this study was to elucidate the
development of bullwhip cells in the embryonic chicken retina. by using bromodeoxyuridine
birth dating, we found that the bullwhip cells are generated very early during retinal
development, between e4 and e5. glucagon peptide was ﬁrst detected in bullwhip cells at
about e10, whereas  xxxg2240xxx  was not detected in the bullwhip cells until e15. although
glucagon peptide is not present during early stages of retinal development, we detected
mrna for  xxxg874xxx  beginning at e7 and mrna for  xxxg873xxx  receptor at e5 through
e14. morphological differentiation of the bullwhip cells begins at about e14 and is completed
by e18. the bullwhip cells are greatly overproduced, and nearly 80% of these cells undergo
apoptotic cell death during late stages of embryonic development. the bullwhip cells that
survive are those that project an axon-like process directly toward the cmz; the cells that
project in an inappropriate direction fail to survive. we conclude that cells fated to become
bullwhip neurons are generated long before they begin to differentiate and that their survival
depends on the orientation of their primary neurite. j. comp.  xxxd122xxx . 503:538 –549, 2007.

retinal stem cells have been identiﬁed in a number of
different vertebrate species (for review see del rio-tsonis
and tsonis, 2003; fischer, 2005; otteson and hitchcock,
2003; raymond and hitchcock, 1997, 2000; reh and levine, 1998). in the postnatal chicken eye, neural stem cells
have been identiﬁed at the peripheral edge of the retina in
a circumferential marginal zone (cmz; fischer et al.,
2002; fischer and reh, 2000) and anterior to the neural
retina in the nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary body
(fischer and reh, 2003). the cmz of the chicken is reminiscent of the well-described cmz of frogs and ﬁsh. several different secreted growth factors have been shown to
stimulate the proliferation of retinal progenitors in the
postnatal chicken eye; these factors include insulin,
 xxxg1144xxx  ( xxxg1144xxx ),  xxxg681xxx  (egf; fischer et al., 2002; fischer and reh, 2000), and
 xxxg2067xxx  (moshiri et al., 2005). we have recently
reported that intraocular injections of glucagon and

glucagon in the embryonic retina
whip cells (ehrlich et al., 1987; fischer et al., 2006). the
bullwhip cells have relatively large cell bodies (⬃14 ␮m in
diameter) that are located among the amacrine cells in the
proximal inner nuclear layer (inl). the bullwhip cells
have a unipolar morphology, produce an axon-like structure that projects into the cmz, and are found only in
ventral regions of the retina. in dorsal regions of the
retina, smaller versions of the bullwhip cells, the minibullwhip cells, form axon-like projections with endings that
are densely ramiﬁed in the cmz. the bullwhip cells are a
distinct type of retinal neuron that shares phenotypic
similarities with amacrine and ganglion cells, including
the expression of neuroﬁlament, pax6, ap2␣, hud, calretinin, trkb, and  xxxg1617xxx  (fischer et al., 2006). there are
only about 240 bullwhip cells per retina, and the number
of these cells does not signiﬁcantly change between postnatal day 1 (p1) and p21 (fischer et al., 2005). the variability in the number of bullwhip cells per retina is high,
ranging from 140 to 400 cells per retina (fischer et al.,
2005). it has been proposed that the bullwhip and
minibullwhip cells convey visual information to the cmz
to control the addition of new cells to the edge of the retina
by releasing glucagon/ xxxg873xxx  that acts in opposition to
insulin (or insulin-like growth factors) to regulate precisely the proliferation of retinal progenitors (fischer et
al., 2005). the existence of bullwhip cells in the retinas of
nonavian species remains unknown. furthermore, the development of the bullwhip cells remains unstudied. therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the
development of this unique type of retinal cell.
here we describe the development of the bullwhip cells
in the embryonic chicken retina. the bullwhip cells are
generated very early but differentiate relatively late during retinal development. we ﬁnd that the bullwhip cells
are signiﬁcantly overproduced and that most of these cells
undergo apoptosis during late stages of embryonic development. the survival of the bullwhip cells may depend on
the orientation of the primary neurite within the retina
and acquisition of sufﬁcient trophic support from target
cells. we also detect the expression of receptors for glucagon and  xxxg873xxx  in the early embryonic retina.

materials and methods
animals
the use of animals in these experiments was in accordance with the guidelines established by the national
institutes of health and the ohio state university. fertilized eggs were obtained from the department of animal
sciences at the ohio state university. chick embryos
were staged according to guidelines established by hamburger and hamilton (1951). newly hatched leghorn
chickens (gallus gallus domesticus) were obtained from
the department of animal sciences at the ohio state
university and kept on a cycle of 12 hours light, 12 hours
dark (lights on  xxxd2274xxx :00 am). chicks were housed in a
stainless-steel brooder at about 30°c and received water
and purina chick starter ad libitum.

brdu injections
at embryonic days 3, 4, 5, and 6, we delivered 50 ␮g of
bromodeoxyuridine (brdu), diluted in 20 ␮l of sterile saline, into the yolk of fertilized eggs. embryos were allowed
to develop until e16 and retinas were harvested and processed for immunolabeling procedures.

reverse transcriptase pcr
at e5, e7, e9, e12, and e14, retinas from three embryos were pooled for each time point and placed in 1.5 ml
trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). total rna was
isolated according to the trizol protocol and resuspended
in 50 ␮l rnase-free water. genomic dna was removed by
using the dna free kit (ambion, austin, tx). cdna was
synthesized from mrna by using superscript ii first
strand synthesis system (invitrogen) and oligo dt primers according to the manufacturer’s protocol. control reactions were performed using all components with the
exception of the reverse transcriptase to exclude the possibility that primers were amplifying genomic dna.
pcr primers were designed by using the web-based
program primer 3 from the whitehead institute for biomedical research (http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/
primer/primer3_www.cgi). primer sequences were as follows: gpp forward 5⬘ gcacagacttggaatggtga 3⬘,
gpp reverse 5⬘ aaggtcaagctgccaaagaa 3⬘,  xxxg874xxx  forward 5⬘ accagcagccagcagtagtt
3⬘,  xxxg874xxx  reverse 5⬘ aaggcttacagcgaggagtg 3⬘,  xxxg873xxx  receptor reverse 5⬘ tgcctccactactgatgctg 3⬘, and  xxxg873xxx  receptor forward 5⬘ aagaatgcctgtggtgacagt 3⬘. predicted product sizes (in
base pairs) were 899 (gpp), 620 ( xxxg874xxx ), and
529 ( xxxg873xxx  receptor). pcrs were performed by using standard protocols and an eppendorf thermal cycler. pcr
products were run on an agarose gel to verify the predicted
product sizes.

fixation, sectioning, and
immunocytochemistry
tissues were ﬁxed, sectioned, and immunolabeled as
described elsewhere (fischer et al., 1998; fischer and
stell, 1999). in short, enucleated eyes were hemisected
equatorially, and the gel vitreous was removed from the
posterior eye cup. eye cups were ﬁxed (4% paraformaldehyde plus 3% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4,
30 minutes at 20°c), washed three times in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs; 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 195 mm
nacl, ph 7.4), cryoprotected in pbs plus 30% sucrose,
immersed in embedding medium (oct compound; tissuetek), and mounted onto sectioning blocks. vertical sections, nominally 14 ␮m thick, were cut consistently from
ventral regions of the retina (where the bullwhip cells are
known to reside) in the nasotemporal plane and thaw
mounted onto superfrost plus slides (fisher scientiﬁc,
fair lawn, nj). sections from control and treated eyes
from the same individual were placed consecutively on
each slide to ensure equal exposures to reagents. sections
were air dried and stored at –20°c until use.
sections were thawed, ringed with rubber cement,
washed three times in pbs, covered with primary antibody solution (200 ␮l of antiserum diluted in pbs plus 5%
normal goat serum, 0.2% triton x-100, and 0.01% nan3),
and incubated for about 24 hours at 20°c in a humidiﬁed
chamber. the slides were washed three times in pbs,
covered with secondary antibody solution, and incubated
for at least 1 hour at 20°c in a humidiﬁed chamber.
finally, samples were washed three times in pbs, rubber
cement was removed from the slides, and coverglass was
mounted on 4:1 (v:v) glycerol:water.
to identify brdu-labeled bullwhip cells, samples were
sequentially labeled with antibodies to glucagon and

brdu, respectively. sections were sequentially incubated
under primary antibodies to glucagon, secondary antibodies to mouse iggs, brieﬂy ﬁxed in 2% pfa plus 3% sucrose
in pbs, treated with 4 n hcl for 7 minutes, washed three
times in pbs, added with antibodies to brdu and, ﬁnally,
antibodies to rat iggs.
working dilutions and sources of antibodies used in this
study included the following. 1) mouse anti-glucagon
raised to full-length  xxxd2208xxx  was used at 1:400
(dr. m. gregor, university of tübingen via the center for
ulcer research and education, ucla). this antibody is
known to recognize both glucagon propeptide and mature
glucagon (gregor and riecken, 1985). 2) rabbit anti- xxxg873xxx 
raised to amino acids 1–19 of human  xxxg873xxx  was used at
1:400 (4660-1604; biogenesis ltd.). this antibody is
known to recognize  xxxg873xxx , cross-react with glucagon (fischer et al., 2005), and selectively label different sets of
cells in the inner nuclear layer (inl) of the chicken retina
(fischer et al., 2006). 3) rat anti- xxxg2240xxx  raised to
full-length of human  xxxg2240xxx  conjugated, via carbodiimide, to bovine  xxxg124xxx  was used at 1:400
(ab6338; abcam). this antibody is known to recognize the
5– 8 c-terminus of  xxxg2240xxx  (cuello et al., 1979) and
selectively label sets of amacrine and bullwhip cells in the
chicken retina (fischer et al., 2006). 4) rat anti-brdu was
used at 1:200 ( xxxd19xxx /75; accurate chemicals). 5) mouse
anti-neuroﬁlament raised to gel-excised bovine nf-m was
used at 1:2,000 (rmo270; dr. v. lee, university of pennsylvania). this antibody is known to recognize a
phosphate-independent epitope in the c-terminal of nf-m
(lee et al., 1982). 6) mouse anti-huc/d raised to a peptide
(qaqrfrldnlln) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (klh) was used at 1:200 (16a11; invitrogenmolecular probes, eugene, or). this antibody binds speciﬁcally to an epitope that is present in hud, huc, and
hel-n1 (marusich et al., 1994) and is known to label
selectively most, if not all, amacrine and ganglion cells
in the chicken retina (fischer and reh, 2000). 7) rabbit
anti-calretinin raised to full-length recombinant human
calretinin was used at 1:1,000 (7699/4; swant immunochemicals). this antibody is known to label selectively
sets of horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion cells in the
chicken retina (fischer et al., 1999, 2007; fischer and
reh, 2000). 8) mouse anti- xxxg1901xxx  at 1:1,000
raised to puriﬁed full-length frog muscle  xxxg1901xxx 
was used at 1:1,000 (p3088; sigma-aldrich, st. louis,
mo). this antibody is known to label selectively efferent
target cells and sets of amacrine cells in the avian
retina (fischer et al., 1999, 2005; fischer and stell,
1999). 9) rabbit anti-cleaved  xxxg341xxx  (cc3) raised to
a peptide (crhteldcgietd; amino acids 163–175 of
human  xxxg341xxx ) was conjugated to klh and used at
1:1,000 (af835; r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). this
antibody is known to selectively label apoptotic ganglion cells in the embryonic chicken retina (borsello et
al., 2002).
none of the observed labeling was due to nonspeciﬁc
binding of secondary antibody or ﬂuorophore; sections labeled with secondary antibodies alone were devoid of ﬂuorescence. secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit
alexa488, goat anti-mouse alexa488/568, and goat antirat alexa488 (invitrogen) diluted to 1:1,000 in pbs plus
0.2% triton x-100.

photography, measurements, cell counts,
and statistical analyses
photomicrographs were taken by using a leica
dm5000b microscope equipped with epiﬂuorescence and a
12-megapixel leica dc500 digital camera. confocal microscopy was performed with a zeiss lsm 510 meta. images were optimized for color, brightness, and contrast,
and double-labeled images were overlaid in adobe photoshop 6.0. cell counts were made from at least ﬁve different
samples, and means and sds calculated for each data set.
we counted total numbers of bullwhip cells per retina
from montage digital images of ventral regions of wholemounted retinas. these counts did not include the
minibullwhip cells that are found only in far dorsal regions of the retina. the angle at which the primary neurites and axon-like structures of bullwhip cells project was
measured relative to the dorsal pole of the eye by using
image pro plus 6.0 (media cybernetics).

results
embryonic development of the bullwhip
cells
the bullwhip cells are an unconventional type of retinal
neuron and may have a unique ontogeny. accordingly, we
sought to characterize the development of the bullwhip
cells. differentiating bullwhip cells were identiﬁed by using antibodies to glucagon and  xxxg2240xxx , neuropeptides
that are expressed by mature bullwhip cells in the postnatal retina (fischer et al., 2005, 2006). weak immunoreactivity for glucagon was ﬁrst detected in a few cells in
ventral and central regions of the retina at e10 (fig. 1a).
by comparison, at e11, we found numerous glucagon-ir
cells in ventral regions of the retina (fig. 1b), whereas
dorsal regions of the retina were devoid of glucagon immunoreactivity. the glucagon-ir cells at e11 had an elongated morphology, with the nucleus displaced toward the
distal end of the cell. at e14, most of the glucagon-ir cells
had accumulated a large volume of cytoplasm in the proximal half of the cells next to the developing ipl (fig. 1c).
at e15 and e16, many of the glucagon-ir cells in central
regions of the retina had formed a thick primary neurite
that turned ⬃90° and coursed along the distal border of
the inner plexiform layer (ipl; fig. 1d,e). beginning at
e15, we detected glucagon immunoreactivity in conventional glucagon-expressing amacrine cells (cgacs) and
neurites at the distal border of the ipl. in whole-mount
preparations of e15 retinas, the bullwhip cells are distinct

and morphologically differentiate from e11 through e19. vertical
sections (a– g,k–m) and whole mounts (h–j) of the retina were labeled
with antibodies to glucagon. tissue was obtained from embryos at e10

from cgacs. at this stage of development, the somata of
the bullwhip cells were about 9 ␮m in diameter, 1–2 ␮m
larger than the somata of the cgacs (fig. 1h). furthermore, the bullwhip cells were intensely immunoreactive
for glucagon, whereas the somata of the cgacs were
weakly immunoreactive (fig. 1h). between e15 and e17,
the morphology of the bullwhip cells changed dramatically; there was a signiﬁcant increase in the diameter of
the somata of the bullwhip cells and the growth of the
primary neurite and axon-like process (compare fig. 1h
and i). between e17 and e19, there was further elaboration of glucagon-ir neurites within the ipl (fig. 1g,i,j).
with little variation between cells, the primary neurite
and axon-like process of the bullwhip cells projected and
coursed straight away from the somata (fig. 1i,j). at e19,
the morphology of the glucagon-ir bullwhip cells was
similar to that of the bullwhip cells observed in the postnatal retina, with a large cell body, a thick primary neurite, and dendrite-like processes extending into the ipl
from the primary neurite (fig. 1j).
the bullwhip cells are known to project axon-like processes into the cmz of the postnatal chicken retina (fischer et al., 2005). we sought to characterize when the
endings of the bullwhip cells accumulate in the cmz. the
developing cmz was identiﬁed by immunolabeling for
markers of early neuronal differentiation (calretinin and
hud; data not shown), which are expressed by neurons
directly adjacent to the cmz during late stages of embryonic development (ghai et al., 2007). in addition, the presumptive cmz can be identiﬁed morphologically; the retina tapers in thickness at the cmz and abruptly
transitions to the pseudostratiﬁed, columnar nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary body (fig. 1k–m). at e16,
we found signiﬁcant accumulations of glucagon-ir neurites in far peripheral regions of the retina that extended
into the presumptive cmz (fig. 1k). at this point in development, a build-up of glucagon-ir neurites was spread
across at least 400 ␮m at the peripheral edge of the retina
(fig. 1k). at e18, the glucagon-ir neurites appeared to
accumulate further and become concentrated in the presumptive cmz (fig. 1l). the area of peripheral retina that
contained a high density of glucagon-positive neurites was
much broader in radial diameter, but thinner in vertical
thickness, than that seen in the postnatal cmz (compare
fig. 1k, l, and m). these ﬁndings suggest that the terminal ﬁelds of the bullwhip cells are reﬁned as the cmz
forms during late stages of embryonic development.
to conﬁrm that the glucagon-ir cells that were observed in the embryonic retina were, indeed, differentiating bullwhip cells, we assessed whether these cells expressed markers (in addition to glucagon) that are known
to be expressed by bullwhip cells. we found that the
glucagon-expressing cells in e15 retinas were immunoreactive for neuroﬁlament (fig. 2a– c), suggesting that these
cells were differentiating bullwhip cells rather than
cgacs (fischer et al., 2006). we have reported previously
that antiserum to  xxxg873xxx  preabsorbed with glucagon does
not label cgacs, but labels bullwhip cells and neurites in
the cmz (fischer et al., 2005). in e15 retina, we found
that the presumptive bullwhip cells remain immunoreactive to antiserum to  xxxg873xxx  that was preabsorbed with
glucagon (fig. 2d,e). we found, in ventral regions of e15
retinas, numerous presumptive bullwhip cells that were
glucagon-ir among efferent target cells (fig. 2f). the efferent target cells, like the bullwhip cells, are a type of

a.j. fischer et al.
unconventional retinal neuron receiving extraretinal input from efferent projections that arise from the isthmooptic nucleus and are known to be immunoreactive for  xxxg1901xxx  (fischer and stell, 1999; uchiyama et al., 2004;
uchiyama and stell, 2005).
we have reported previously that the bullwhip cells
express  xxxg2240xxx  in the postnatal chicken retina (fischer et al., 2006). immunoreactivity for  xxxg2240xxx  was
ﬁrst detected and colocalized in presumptive bullwhip
cells at e15 in central regions of the ventral retina (fig.
2g–i). by comparison, the glucagon-ir bullwhip cells in
peripheral regions of the retina were negative for  xxxg2240xxx  at e15 (fig. 2j–l). these ﬁndings suggest that the
expression of glucagon and  xxxg2240xxx  occurs independently in bullwhip cells and that the expression of  xxxg2240xxx  occurs after that of glucagon.

bullwhip cells are overproduced during
development
bullwhip cells are far more abundant in the embryonic
retina than in the postnatal retina. in the postnatal retina, there are about 240 bullwhip cells per retina (fischer
et al., 2005). at e15, there was an average of 1,329.4 ⫾
467.7 (mean ⫾ sd) bullwhip cells per retina (n ⫽ 10).
these cell counts did not include the minibullwhip cells
that are found only in dorsal and far peripheral regions of
the retina. the differentiating bullwhip cells were found
ventral to a distinct boundary across the nasal-temporal
plane of the retina, above which large glucagon-ir cells
were not found (fig. 3a), similar to bullwhip cells in the
postnatal retina (fig. 3b). in the e15 retina, there was a
signiﬁcant range in the number of bullwhip cells per retina, as few as 624 and as many as 1,972. taken together,
these ﬁndings suggest that the bullwhip cells are signiﬁcantly overproduced during embryonic development.
in the postnatal retina, the orientation of the primary
projections of bullwhip cells is coordinated toward the
peripheral retina and cmz (fig. 3d,f; fischer et al., 2005).
by contrast, the orientation of the primary projections of
bullwhip cells in the embryonic retina appears to be random (fig. 3c,e). relative to the dorsal pole of the eye, the
orientation of the primary neurite of the e15 bullwhip
cells is highly variable; 124.2° ⫾ 137.4° (mean ⫾ sd; n ⫽
221; fig. 3e,g). by contrast, the orientation of the primary
neurite of the bullwhip cells in the p1 retina is highly
coordinated; 78.7° ⫾ 25.3° (mean ⫾ sd; n ⫽ 124; fig. 3f,h).
the variation of the mean trajectory angle of the primary
neurite and axon-like process was signiﬁcantly greater
(p ⬍ 0.0001, anova) for the e15 bullwhip cells compared
with that of the bullwhip cells at p1. it remains uncertain
how the orientation of the primary neurites and axon-like
projections become coordinated among the bullwhip cells
during late stages of embryonic development.

many bullwhip cells are immunoreactive for
activated  xxxg341xxx  during late stages of
development
during late stages of embryonic development, many of
the bullwhip cells become apoptotic. to identify apoptotic
bullwhip cells, we labeled whole-mounts of the retina with
antibodies to cleaved  xxxg341xxx  (cc3) and glucagon.
 xxxg341xxx  is a protease that is activated by cleavage as
part of an enzyme cascade involved in apoptotic cell death.
in e15 and e16 retinas, there were many (between 8 and

94 cells per retina) bullwhip cells that were immunoreactive for glucagon and cc3 (fig. 4a– c). at this stage of
development, the bullwhip cells have not yet acquired
their distinctive morphology, but many of these cells had
already formed a rudimentary primary neurite. in general, the cc3-positive bullwhip cells at e15 and e16 had
formed a primary neurite that was not projecting directly
toward the peripheral edge of the retina. the glucagonpositive cells that were immunoreactive for cc3 were all
found in ventral and midperipheral regions of the retina.
in e18 retinas we found many (between 75 and 148 cells
per retina) bullwhip cells that were immunoreactive for
glucagon and cc3 (fig. 4d–i). the glucagon/cc3-positive
cells were scattered across ventral and midperipheral regions of the retina. at this stage of development, the
cc3-ir cells had acquired the morphology of mature bullwhip cells, with a thick primary neurite projecting away
from the cell body toward the periphery of retina (fig.
4d–i). we failed to ﬁnd cgacs that were cc3-positive,
regardless of the stage of the development, indicating that
this type of glucagon-expressing neuron does not undergo
cc3-mediated apoptosis to reduce the population to appropriate levels.

bullwhip cells become terminally mitotic
sometime between e4 and e5
we used brdu birth-dating to determine when the cells
that are destined to differentiate into bullwhip cells are
generated. cells with nuclei that were heavily labeled
with brdu were likely generated by progenitors that went
through terminal s-phase shortly after the delivery of the
brdu. cells with nuclei that were partially labeled with
brdu (containing only puncta of ﬂuorescence) were likely
generated subsequent to one or more divisions, and dilutions of the brdu, before terminal mitosis. we found bullwhip cells labeled with brdu in central/ventral regions of
the retina when the brdu was applied at e4 (fig. 5a,b).
brdu at e4 labeled many presumptive ganglion cells with
nuclei in the gcl, whereas relatively few cells in the inl
were completely labeled, suggesting that the bullwhip
cells are among the ﬁrst types of inl cells that are generated during embryonic development. when brdu was
applied at e5, we found brdu-labeled bullwhip cells in
peripheral regions of the retina (fig. 5c,d). by comparison,
many bullwhip cells in more central regions of the retina
were brdu negative, indicating that these cells were postmitotic before the application of brdu at e5 (fig. 5e,f). we
failed to ﬁnd bullwhip cells that were labeled when the
brdu was delivered at e6 or later (data not shown). many
cgacs in central regions of the retina were brdu positive
when the brdu was applied at e5 (fig. 5g,h), indicating
that the cgacs, like the bullwhip cells, are generated
relatively early during retinal development. taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the terminal mitosis of
the bullwhip cells occurs between e4 and e5 and that the
cgacs are generated at about e5.

expression of receptors for glucagon,  xxxg873xxx ,
and  xxxg873xxx  in the embryonic retina
by using rt-pcr, we assayed for the expression of
glucagon propeptide and receptors for glucagon and  xxxg873xxx 
in the embryonic retina. we detected signiﬁcant amounts
of mrna for glucagon propeptide in e9 retinas (fig. 6),
about 1–2 days before we were able to detect immunoreactivity for glucagon in differentiating retinal cells. rela-

a.j. fischer et al.
tive levels of mrna for glucagon propeptide were greater
at e12 and e14 compared with earlier stages of development (fig. 6). we failed to detect signiﬁcant levels of
mrna for the  xxxg874xxx  in the retina at e5,
whereas we detected a faint band for the pcr product at
e7 (fig. 6). mrna for the  xxxg874xxx  was detected
at relatively high levels beginning at e9 (fig. 6). the
expression of the  xxxg874xxx  was maintained from
e9 through e14 (fig. 6) and is known to continue in the
postnatal retina (fischer et al., 2005). mrna for the  xxxg873xxx 
receptor was detected at e5 and was maintained throughout subsequent stages of development (fig. 6) and in the
postnatal retina (fischer et al., 2005). taken together,
these ﬁndings indicate that the receptors for glucagon and
 xxxg873xxx  are expressed before the ligands are produced by
retinal cells.

discussion
the bullwhip cells are a unique type of retinal neuron
and develop in a unique manner. we found that the cells
fated to become bullwhip cells go through terminal mitosis
early during retinal development, at about e4, when ganglion cells are the predominant type of cells that is being
generated (prada et al., 1991). interestingly, the celldistinguishing features of the bullwhip cells are not manifested until e10, about 6 days after the terminal mitosis.
the differentiation of the bullwhip cells was ﬁrst indicated
by the expression of glucagon, and, subsequently, these
cells underwent morphological differentiation, which occurred gradually from e11 through e18. the presumptive
bullwhip cells were immunoreactive for glucagon/ xxxg873xxx 
prior to morphological differentiation and about 5 days
prior to the onset of  xxxg2240xxx  expression. these ﬁndings suggest that there may be a developmental requirement for the synthesis of glucagon during the differentiation and patterning of bullwhip cells.
the bullwhip cells are generated early during retinal
development (between e4 and e5) but do not begin to
differentiate until about e11. by contrast, some types of
amacrine cells appear to differentiate shortly after the
terminal mitosis. for example, the cholinergic amacrine
cells are among the ﬁrst type of amacrine cell to differentiate and their differentiation begins at e6 when they

fig. 3. bullwhip cells are more abundant in the embryonic retina
and project their primary neurite in random directions. retinas were
obtained from e15 embryos or 1-day-old hatched chicks (p1), labeled
with antibodies to glucagon, and whole mounted. similar to bullwhip
cells in the postnatal retina, bullwhip cells in the embryonic retina are
found only in ventral regions of the eye. the yellow lines in a,b
indicate the dorsal boundary of the bullwhip cells. the arrows in c,d
are aligned with the direction that the primary neurite of the bullwhip

cells. g,h: schematic diagrams illustrating the average trajectory

appear to be derived from a pool of undifferentiated, postmitotic cells (prada et al., 1999; spira et al., 1987). the
cholinergic amacrine cells begin to express choline acetyl
transferase (chat) at e6 (spira et al., 1987), spatially
pattern at e8, and begin to extend dendrites at e8 (prada
et al., 1999). the bullwhip cells do not express transcription factors (islet1, islet2, or brn3a) that are expressed by
ganglion cells, but do express transcription factors (pax6
and ap2␣) that are expressed by most types of amacrine
cells (fischer et al., 2006). taken together, these ﬁndings
suggest that the bullwhip cells may be derived from a pool
of early-born undifferentiated amacrine cells. the cues
that promote the differentiation of a small subset amacrine precursor cells (⬃1,400 cells per retina) into bullwhip cells remain unknown but may rely on a series of
cues that are not present until relatively late stages of
retinal development. similarly, some types of amacrine
cells do not differentiate until late stages of development.
these cells include those that utilize the transmitters
dopamine, which begin to express  xxxg2276xxx  at
e12, enkephalin beginning at e15, and  xxxg2417xxx  (vip) beginning at e15 (prada oliveira et al.,
2003). the expression of these transmitters typically
marks the onset of differentiation and can occur as much
as 9 days after terminal mitosis in the chick retina (prada
oliveira et al., 2003).
the survival of the bullwhip cells may depend on
chance: the chance that their primary neurite is formed in
the appropriate direction. during late stages of embryonic
development (e15), the bullwhip cells in the retina have a
highly variable orientation, with their primary neurite
and axon-like process projecting in random directions
away from the cell body. at the time of hatching, the
direction of the primary neurites and axon-like processes
of the bullwhip cells is highly coordinated, coursing in a
straight line toward the periphery of the retina (fischer et
al., 2005, 2006). at e15 and subsequent stages of development, the primary neurite of the bullwhip cells projects
straight away from the cell body, with few exceptions, and
we never observed instances in which the axon-like process deviated from a straight trajectory. this ﬁnding suggests that growing axon-like projections of the bullwhip
cells do not actively turn toward the target ﬁeld (cmz)
and that the extension of the bullwhip axon-like processes
might not be guided by cues that turn growth cones. in
other words, our observations suggest that the growing
axon-like processes of the bullwhip cells are oblivious to
guidance cues or that there is an absence of these cues
that could attract these projections to the nearest target
ﬁeld within the cmz. it seems unlikely that the bullwhip
cells that project in inappropriate directions retract their
primary neurite and axon-like process and reproject these
structures in a more suitable direction. instead, it is more
likely that the bullwhip cells that project inappropriately
do not survive. if this hypothesis is correct, it implies that
the original orientation and patterning of the bullwhip
cells is not guided by cues and those cells that project in
the proper direction survive only if they form a primary
neurite and axon-like process within a suitable range of
directions. the range in the variation of the orientation of
the bullwhip cells in the postnatal retina is about 50°. if
the original direction of the bullwhip projections is randomly distributed through 360°, and only those cells that
project in a “50° window” survive, then it is expected that
only one-seventh of the bullwhip cells will survive. this

a.j. fischer et al.
hypothesis is supported by the data that we report here;
on average, only 240 of 1,330 cells survive in the postnatal
retina. the attrition of bullwhip cells that project in unsuitable directions leaves behind only those bullwhip cells
that project in a coordinated pattern in the postnatal
retina. we propose that the bullwhip cells that project in
an inappropriate direction are removed from the retina by
apoptotic cell death. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the bullwhip cells that fail to acquire
appropriate targets down-regulate peptides (glucagon,
 xxxg873xxx , and  xxxg2240xxx ) and assume a different phenotype
instead of undergoing apoptosis.
we found that the number of glucagon-ir bullwhip
cells in ventral regions of the retina is dramatically
reduced during late stages of embryonic development
through the time of hatching. there were nearly six
times as many bullwhip cells in the e15 retina compared with the p1 retina (see fig. 3). similarly, retinal
ganglion cells are known to be overproduced, and ganglion cells that fail to acquire appropriate target and
trophic support undergo apoptosis (bahr, 2000; cellerino et al., 2000; de la rosa and de pablo, 2000).
during early stages of apoptosis, cells can be positive for
cc3 and cell-distinguishing markers for a brief period
before cellular degeneration renders the cells unidentiﬁable. we found many bullwhip cells that were immunoreactive for cc3 and glucagon between e15 and e18.
many of the apoptotic bullwhip cells observed at e18
projected toward the cmz, similar to the normal bullwhip cells, whereas the apoptotic bullwhip cells at earlier stages of development had the tendency to project
their primary neurite away from the nearest retinal
edge. it is possible that the cc3-positive bullwhip cells
at e18 that projected in the proper direction failed to
acquire sufﬁcient trophic support from target cells.
taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that apoptosis is
the mechanism responsible for the removal of bullwhip
cells from the retina. it is possible that the bullwhip
cells derive trophic support from cells within their terminal ﬁelds (progenitors in the cmz) or from neighboring cells in ventral regions of the retina. the bullwhip
cells are known to express the  xxxg259xxx  receptors
trkb and  xxxg1617xxx  and to send axon-like processes that
terminate in the cmz (fischer et al., 2006). we propose
that the bullwhip cells may compete for trophic support
from progenitor cells within the cmz.
we found that, within the developing retina, receptors for  xxxg873xxx  are likely to be expressed before e5,
whereas receptors for glucagon are expressed starting
at about e7. these ﬁndings suggest that retinal development may be inﬂuenced by glucagon or  xxxg873xxx . however, mrnas for glucagon and  xxxg873xxx  receptors were
detected at about e9, days before we detected glucagon
and  xxxg873xxx  peptides within retina cells. it is possible
that the mrnas for the glucagon propeptide and
glucagon/ xxxg873xxx  receptors are present several days before the mature proteins. alternatively, it is possible
that glucagon and  xxxg873xxx  that are synthesized outside of
the eye and disseminated systemically act at receptors
on embryonic retinal cells prior to e10. glucagonproducing cells have been identiﬁed in the splenic lobe
of the pancreas of chick embryos as early as e6 (cowap,
1985), which is consistent with the hypothesis that systemic glucagon may inﬂuence cells in the developing
retina. we have reported that glucagon and  xxxg873xxx  sup-

press the proliferation of retinal progenitors in the postnatal eye (fischer et al., 2005). thus, it is possible that
glucagon and  xxxg873xxx  inﬂuence the proliferation of progenitors
in the embryonic retina. further studies are required to test
these hypotheses.

ment even though these cells are born early during
development. we ﬁnd that bullwhip cells are overproduced by nearly sixfold and that the numbers of these
cells are depleted via apoptosis between e15 and the
time of hatching at about e21. unlike the bullwhip cells
in the postnatal retina, the orientation of embryonic
bullwhip cells appears to be random in the embryonic
retina. we propose that the bullwhip cells that project
improperly fail to obtain sufﬁcient target-derived trophic support and undergo apoptosis.

conclusions
we conclude that the differentiation of bullwhip cells
occurs relatively late during embryonic retinal develop-
