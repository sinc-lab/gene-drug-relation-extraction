(prowess) study group*

abstract
background  xxxd1948xxx  (activated), or recombinant human  xxxg1847xxx , has antithrombotic,
antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties. in a
previous study,  xxxd1948xxx  activated produced
dose-dependent reductions in the levels of markers
of coagulation and inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. in this phase 3 trial, we assessed whether
treatment with  xxxd1948xxx  activated reduced the
rate of death from any cause among patients with
severe sepsis.
methods we conducted a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. patients with systemic inflammation and organ failure due to acute infection were enrolled and assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either placebo or  xxxd1948xxx 
activated (24 µg per kilogram of body weight per hour)
for a total duration of 96 hours. the prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause and
was assessed 28 days after the start of the infusion.
patients were monitored for adverse events; changes
in vital signs, laboratory variables, and the results of
microbiologic cultures; and the development of neutralizing antibodies against  xxxg1847xxx .
results a total of 1690 randomized patients were
treated (840 in the placebo group and 850 in the
 xxxd1948xxx  activated group). the mortality rate
was 30.8 percent in the placebo group and 24.7 percent in the  xxxd1948xxx  activated group. on the basis of the prospectively defined primary analysis, treatment with  xxxd1948xxx  activated was associated
with a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) and
an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6.1 percent
(p=0.005). the incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the  xxxd1948xxx  activated group than in the
placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent, p=0.06).
conclusions treatment with  xxxd1948xxx  activated significantly reduces mortality in patients with
severe sepsis and may be associated with an increased
risk of bleeding.

s

evere sepsis, defined as sepsis associated with
acute organ dysfunction, results from a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant response
to an infection.1 the rate of death from severe
sepsis ranges from 30 to 50 percent despite advances
in critical care.2-5 in the united states, approximately
750,000 cases of sepsis occur each year, at least
225,000 of which are fatal.6
the inflammatory and procoagulant host responses to infection are closely related.7 inflammatory cytokines, including  xxxg2296xxx  a, interleukin-1b, and interleukin-6, are capable of activating
coagulation and inhibiting fibrinolysis, whereas the
procoagulant thrombin is capable of stimulating multiple inflammatory pathways.7-11 the end result may
be diffuse endovascular injury, multiorgan dysfunction,
and death.  xxxg1847xxx , an endogenous protein that promotes fibrinolysis and inhibits thrombosis and inflammation, is an important modulator of the
coagulation and inflammation associated with severe
sepsis (fig. 1).18  xxxg1847xxx  is converted from
its inactive precursor, protein c, by thrombin coupled
to  xxxg2277xxx .18 the conversion of protein c

figure 1. proposed actions of  xxxg1847xxx  in modulating the systemic inflammatory, procoagulant, and fibrinolytic host
responses to infection.
the inflammatory and procoagulant host responses to infection are intricately linked. infectious agents and inflammatory cytokines
such as  xxxg2296xxx  a ( xxxg2296xxx ) and interleukin-1 activate coagulation by stimulating the release of  xxxg748xxx  from monocytes and the endothelium. the presentation of  xxxg748xxx  leads to the formation of thrombin and a fibrin clot. inflammatory
cytokines and thrombin can both impair the endogenous fibrinolytic potential by stimulating the release of plasminogen-activator
inhibitor 1 (pai-1) from platelets and the endothelium. pai-1 is a potent inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator, the endogenous
pathway for lysing a fibrin clot. in addition, the procoagulant thrombin is capable of stimulating multiple inflammatory pathways
and further suppressing the endogenous fibrinolytic system by activating  xxxg503xxx  (tafi). the conversion of protein c, by thrombin bound to  xxxg2277xxx , to the  xxxg745xxx   xxxg1847xxx  is impaired by the inflammatory response. endothelial injury results in decreased  xxxg2277xxx  levels. the end result of the host response to infection
may be the development of diffuse endovascular injury, microvascular thrombosis, organ ischemia, multiorgan dysfunction, and
death.  xxxg1847xxx  can intervene at multiple points during the systemic response to infection. it exerts an antithrombotic
effect by inactivating factors va and viiia, limiting the generation of thrombin. as a result of decreased thrombin levels, the inflammatory, procoagulant, and antifibrinolytic response induced by thrombin is reduced. in vitro data indicate that  xxxg1847xxx 
exerts an antiinflammatory effect by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines ( xxxg2296xxx , interleukin-1, and interleukin-6)
by monocytes and limiting the rolling of monocytes and neutrophils on injured endothelium by binding selectins.  xxxg1847xxx 
indirectly increases the fibrinolytic response by inhibiting pai-1.12-17

to  xxxg1847xxx  may be impaired during sepsis
as a result of the down-regulation of  xxxg2277xxx 
by inflammatory cytokines.19 reduced levels of protein c are found in the majority of patients with sepsis
and are associated with an increased risk of death.20-23
previous preclinical and clinical studies showed that
the administration of  xxxg1847xxx  may improve
the outcome of severe sepsis. the administration of  xxxg1847xxx  was protective in a baboon model
of lethal escherichia coli sepsis.24 in a placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in patients with severe sepsis, an
infusion of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated), or recombinant
human  xxxg1847xxx  (eli lilly, indianapolis),
hereafter referred to as  xxxd1948xxx  activated, resulted in dose-dependent reductions in the plasma levels of d-dimer and serum levels of interleukin-6, markers of coagulopathy and inflammation, respectively.25
we therefore evaluated whether the administration of
 xxxd1948xxx  activated would reduce the rate of
death from all causes at 28 days in patients with severe
sepsis and have an acceptable safety profile.
methods
patients
from july 1998 through june 2000, eligible patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,
which was conducted at 164 centers in 11 countries. the institutional review board at each center approved the protocol, and written
informed consent was obtained from all participants or their authorized representatives. the clinical coordinating center (vanderbilt coordinating center, nashville) was available 24 hours a day throughout the study to answer investigators’ questions regarding patients’
eligibility and safety and the reporting of serious adverse events.
selection criteria
the criteria for severe sepsis were a modification of those defined by bone et al. (appendix 1).26 patients were eligible for the
trial if they had a known or suspected infection on the basis of
clinical data at the time of screening and if they met the following
criteria within a 24-hour period: three or more signs of systemic
inflammation and the sepsis-induced dysfunction of at least one
organ or system that lasted no longer than 24 hours. patients had
to begin treatment within 24 hours after they met the inclusion
criteria. exclusion criteria are summarized in appendix 2.
treatment assignments
patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive
 xxxd1948xxx  activated or placebo (0.9 percent saline with or
without 0.1 percent human  xxxg124xxx ) at each center. block
randomization stratified according to site was used, and all assignments were made through a central randomization center.  xxxd1948xxx  activated, at a dose of 24 µg per kilogram of body weight
per hour, or placebo was administered intravenously at a constant
rate from foil-wrapped bags for a total duration of 96 hours. the
patients, investigators, and the sponsor were unaware of the patients’
treatment assignments.  xxxd1948xxx  activated was produced
from an established mammalian cell line into which the complementary dna for human protein c had been inserted. 27
the infusion was interrupted 1 hour before any percutaneous
procedure or major surgery and was resumed 1 hour and 12 hours
later, respectively, in the absence of bleeding complications. the
study protocol did not call for a standardized approach to critical
care (e.g., the use of antibiotics, fluids, vasopressors, or ventilatory
support).

evaluation of patients
patients were followed for 28 days after the start of the infusion
or until death. base-line characteristics including demographic information and information on preexisting conditions, organ function, markers of disease severity, infection, and hematologic and
other laboratory tests were assessed within 24 hours before the infusion was begun. blood samples obtained at base line, on days 1
through 7, and on days 14 and 28 were assayed for d-dimer levels
(liatest d-d1 latex agglutination test kit, diagnostica stago, asnieres, france) and for interleukin-6 levels (quantikine hs enzyme
immunoassay kit, r & d systems, minneapolis). all measurements
were performed by a central laboratory (covance central lab services, indianapolis). blood samples for the measurement of neutralizing antibodies against  xxxg1847xxx  were collected on days
14 and 28 or at the time of discharge from the hospital if it occurred
before one or both of these dates. microbiologic-culture results
were assessed each day beginning 48 hours after the initiation of the
infusion and continuing through day 28. patients were defined as
having a deficiency of protein c if their plasma protein c activity
level was below the lower limit of normal (81 percent) within 24
hours before the initiation of the infusion and defined as having
septic shock if they met the criteria for cardiovascular dysfunction
at any time within 6 hours before the start of the infusion.
statistical analysis
the primary efficacy end point was death from any cause and
was assessed 28 days after the initiation of the infusion. our prospectively defined primary analysis included all patients who received
the infusion for any length of time, with patients analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned at randomization. the trial was designed to enroll 2280 patients; two planned
interim analyses by an independent data and safety monitoring
board occurred after 760 and 1520 patients had been enrolled. statistical guidelines to suspend enrollment if  xxxd1948xxx  activated was found to be significantly more efficacious than placebo
were determined a priori and used the o’brien–fleming spending
function according to the method of lan and demets. 28
data were analyzed according to a prospectively defined plan.
the primary analysis was based on a cochran–mantel–haenszel
test in which the groups were stratified on the basis of three baseline covariates: severity of disease, as reflected by the score on the
acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii (apache ii)29
(3 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, or 30 to 53, with higher scores indicating more severe disease); age (younger than 60 years or 60
years or older); and plasma protein c activity level (40 percent or
less, 41 to 60 percent, 61 to 80 percent, 81 percent or more, or unknown). the corresponding relative risk and 95 percent confidence
interval were calculated with use of the logit-adjusted method. the
time from the start of the infusion to death was compared in the
two groups in a similar manner with use of a stratified log-rank test.
results of both stratified and nonstratified analyses are reported.
we evaluated the consistency of the effects of treatment on the
risk of death in the subgroups by determining whether the relative risk and 95 percent confidence interval for each subgroup included the observed relative risk for the entire population.
changes from base-line levels of plasma d-dimer and serum interleukin-6 were analyzed in patients who had subsequent measurements with the use of analysis of variance of ranked data. for
patients with missing data, we used the last-observation-carriedforward method of imputation. the proportion of patients who
had serious adverse events and new infections was compared in the
two groups with the use of pearson’s chi-square tests. all reported
p values are two-sided.

tire 28-day study period except for one patient in the
 xxxd1948xxx  activated group who did not receive
the study drug. this patient was classified as having
died on day 28 in the mortality analysis of all randomized patients.
at base line, the demographic characteristics and
severity of disease were similar in the placebo group
and the  xxxd1948xxx  activated group (table 1).
approximately 75 percent of the patients had at least
two dysfunctional organs or systems at the time of enrollment. the lungs and the abdomen were the most
common sites of infection, occurring in 53.6 percent
and 19.9 percent of the patients, respectively, in the
two groups combined (table 2). the incidence of
gram-positive and gram-negative infections was similar within each group and between the two groups.
base-line levels of indicators of coagulopathy and inflammation were also similar in the two groups (table 3). protein c deficiency was present in 87.6 percent of the patients (1379 of 1574) for whom levels
were obtained. in addition, plasma d-dimer and serum
interleukin-6 levels were elevated in 99.7 and 98.5 percent of the patients, respectively. among treated patients, 82.4 percent of those in the placebo group and
81.8 percent of those in the  xxxd1948xxx  activated
group received at least 90 percent of the intended
infusion and 8.2 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively,
died during the 96-hour period of infusion.
efficacy

twenty-eight days after the start of the infusion,
259 of 840 patients in the placebo group (30.8 percent) and 210 of 850 (24.7 percent) of the patients in
the  xxxd1948xxx  activated group had died. this difference in the rate of death from any cause was significant (p=0.005 in the nonstratified analysis) (table 4)
and was associated with an absolute reduction in the
risk of death of 6.1 percent. the prospectively defined
primary analysis in which the groups were stratified
according to the base-line apache ii score, age, and
protein c activity produced similar results (p=0.005),
as did the analysis that included the 38 patients who
underwent randomization but who never received the
infusion (p=0.003). the results of the prospectively
defined primary analysis represent a reduction in the
relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) in association with treatment with  xxxd1948xxx  activated, as compared with
placebo. a kaplan–meier analysis of survival yielded
similar results (p=0.006) (fig. 2). the absolute difference in survival between the two groups was evident within days after the initiation of the infusion and
continued to increase throughout the remainder of the
study period.
prospectively defined subgroup analyses were performed for a number of base-line characteristics, including the apache ii score, the number of dysfunctional organs or systems, other indicators of the

complications

the percentage of patients who had at least one serious adverse event was similar in the two groups (table 5). the incidence of serious bleeding was higher
in the  xxxd1948xxx  activated group than in the
placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent) (p=0.06).
this difference in the incidence of serious bleeding
was observed only during the infusion period; thereafter, the incidence was similar in the two groups.
among the patients who received  xxxd1948xxx 
activated, the incidence of serious bleeding was similar for those who received  xxxd1948xxx  activated
alone and those who also received heparin (3.7 percent and 3.5 percent). in both the  xxxd1948xxx 
activated group and the placebo group, serious bleeding occurred primarily in patients with an identifiable
predisposition to bleeding, such as gastrointestinal
ulceration, an activated partial-thromboplastin time
of more than 120 seconds, a prolonged prothrombin
time (an international normalized ratio of more than
3.0), a platelet count that decreased to less than
30,000 per cubic millimeter and remained at that level despite standard therapy, traumatic injury of a blood
vessel, or traumatic injury of a highly vascular organ.
there was a fatal intracranial hemorrhage in two patients in the  xxxd1948xxx  activated group during
the infusion (on day 1 and day 4) and in one patient

discussion

in this study, the administration of drotrecogin
alfa activated reduced the rate of death from any cause
at 28 days in patients with a clinical diagnosis of severe
sepsis, resulting in a 19.4 percent reduction in the relative risk of death and an absolute reduction of 6.1
percent. a survival benefit was evident throughout
the 28-day study period, whether or not the groups
were stratified according to the severity of disease. our
results indicate that in this population, 1 additional
life would be saved for every 16 patients treated with
 xxxd1948xxx  activated.

*a serious bleeding event was defined as any intracranial hemorrhage,
any life-threatening bleeding, any bleeding event classified as serious by the
investigator, or any bleeding that required the administration of 3 units of
packed  xxxd187xxx  on two consecutive days.
†these patients received 3 units of packed  xxxd187xxx  on two consecutive
days but had no identifiable source of bleeding.

the ne w e n g l a nd jo u r n a l o f me d ic i ne

with respect to clinical features, it was homogeneous
with respect to the biochemical evidence of systemic
inflammation and coagulopathy. in these patients, the
benefit of  xxxd1948xxx  activated is most likely explained by the drug’s biologic activity.  xxxg1847xxx  inhibits the generation of thrombin by inactivating  xxxg749xxx  and  xxxg751xxx .30,31 as compared
with the patients who received placebo, patients who
received  xxxd1948xxx  activated had greater decreases in plasma d-dimer levels during the first seven days
after the infusion was initiated, indicating a reduction
in the generation of thrombin. the rise in d-dimer
levels after the completion of the 96-hour infusion of
 xxxd1948xxx  activated indicates incomplete resolution of the procoagulant state seen in patients with
sepsis. an evaluation of longer periods of infusion of
 xxxd1948xxx  activated may be warranted.
treatment with  xxxd1948xxx  activated decreased
inflammation, as indicated by decreases in interleukin-6 levels, a finding consistent with the known antiinflammatory activity of  xxxg1847xxx . the
antiinflammatory activity of  xxxd1948xxx  activated
may be mediated indirectly through the inhibition of
the generation of thrombin, which leads to decreased
activation of platelets, recruitment of neutrophils, and
degranulation of mast cells.8 furthermore, preclinical
studies demonstrated that  xxxg1847xxx  has direct antiinflammatory properties, including the inhibition of neutrophil activation, the production of cytokines by lipopolysaccharide-challenged monocytes,
and  xxxg2048xxx –mediated adhesion of cells to vascular
endothelium.32-34
a consistent effect of treatment with drotrecogin
alfa activated was seen among the subgroups examined, including those stratified according to age,
apache ii score, sex, number of dysfunctional organs or systems, type of infection (gram-positive,
gram-negative, or mixed), site of infection, and presence or absence of protein c deficiency at study entry.
reductions in the relative risk of death were observed
regardless of whether the patients had a deficiency of
protein c at base line, suggesting that drotrecogin
alfa activated has pharmacologic effects that go beyond
simple physiologic replacement of  xxxg1847xxx .

this observation further suggests that measurements
of protein c are not necessary to identify which patients would benefit from treatment with drotrecogin
alfa activated. a consistent treatment effect was also
observed regardless of the site of infection or the type
of infection.
it was consistent with the antithrombotic activity
of  xxxd1948xxx  activated that bleeding was the
most common adverse event associated with the administration of the drug. the incidence of serious
bleeding suggests that 1 additional serious bleeding
event would occur for every 66 patients treated with
 xxxd1948xxx  activated. serious bleeding tended to
occur in patients with predisposing conditions, such
as gastrointestinal ulceration, traumatic injury of a
blood vessel or highly vascular organ injury, or markedly abnormal values for indicators of coagulation
(e.g., the platelet count, the activated partial-thromboplastin time, and the prothrombin time). the incidence of thrombotic events was not increased by
treatment with activated  xxxd1948xxx , and the antiinflammatory effect was not associated with an increased incidence of new infections. treatment with
 xxxd1948xxx  activated was not associated with the
development of neutralizing antibodies against  xxxg1847xxx .
in summary, the biologic activity of drotrecogin
alfa activated was demonstrated by the finding of
greater decreases in d-dimer and interleukin-6 levels
in patients who received  xxxd1948xxx  activated than
in those who received placebo. the higher incidence
of serious bleeding during infusion in the drotrecogin
alfa activated group is consistent with the antithrombotic activity of the drug and occurs predominantly in
patients with a predisposition to bleeding. in patients
with severe sepsis, an intravenous infusion of  xxxd1948xxx  activated at a dose of 24 µg per kilogram per
hour for 96 hours was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and a safety profile that was acceptable within the context of this clinical trial.
