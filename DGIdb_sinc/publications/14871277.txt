summary

antidopaminergic gastrointestinal prokinetics ( xxxd374xxx , clebopride,  xxxd1927xxx , levosulpiride and metoclopramide) have been exploited clinically for the
management of motor disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including functional dyspepsia, gastric
stasis of various origins and emesis. the prokinetic effect
of these drugs is mediated through the blockade of
enteric (neuronal and muscular) inhibitory d2 receptors. the pharmacological profiles of the marketed
compounds differ in terms of their molecular structure,
affinity at d2 receptors, ability to interact with other
receptor systems [5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-ht3) and
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors for metoclopramide;  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
for levosulpiride) and ability to permeate the blood–
brain barrier (compared with the other compounds,
 xxxd1927xxx  does not easily cross the barrier). it has
been suggested that the serotonergic ( xxxg1117xxx ) component of some antidopaminergic prokinetics may
enhance their therapeutic efficacy in gastrointestinal

disorders, such as functional dyspepsia and diabetic
gastroparesis. the antagonism of central d2 receptors
may lead to both therapeutic (e.g. anti-emetic effect due
to  xxxg656xxx  blockade in the area postrema) and
adverse (including hyperprolactinaemia and extrapyramidal dystonic reactions) effects. as the pituitary (as
well as the area postrema) is outside the blood–brain
barrier, hyperprolactinaemia is a side-effect occurring
with all antidopaminergic prokinetics, although to
different extents. extrapyramidal reactions are most
commonly observed with compounds crossing the
blood–brain barrier, although with some differences
amongst the various agents. prokinetics with a high
dissociation constant compared with that of dopamine
at the  xxxg656xxx  (i.e. compounds that bind loosely to
d2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway) elicit fewer
extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. a knowledge of
central and peripheral  xxxg656xxx  pharmacology can
help the clinician to choose between the antidopaminergic prokinetics to obtain a more favourable risk/
benefit ratio.

in peripheral organs, such as the gut, the extent of
dopaminergic innervation is much less well documented
and controversy still exists with regard to the true
source (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) of enteric dopamine.4–6 nevertheless, antidopaminergic agents have
been exploited clinically for the management of gastrointestinal motor disorders of the upper gut, including
functional dyspepsia, gastric stasis of various origins
and emesis.
the influence of dopamine on different brain functions
led to the hypothesis of the existence of several
dopamine receptor subtypes. early studies allowed the
identification of two classes of dopamine receptor: d1
and d2. further receptor heterogeneity was disclosed
with the use of gene cloning techniques which revealed
the existence of at least five dopamine receptor subtypes
(dopamine receptors: d1–d5).7, 8
in this review, we provide an outline of the dopaminergic system in the gastrointestinal tract and focus on
the  xxxg656xxx  subtype. in particular, the
effects of  xxxg656xxx  blockade by various gastrointestinal prokinetics ( xxxd1927xxx ,  xxxd374xxx , clebopride,
levosulpiride and metoclopramide), at both the enteric
(prokinetic therapeutic effect) and central (anti-emetic
effect and side-effects, including extrapyramidal reactions and hyperprolactinaemia) level, are discussed,
outlining the similarities and differences between compounds of this therapeutic class.
dopamine in the gastrointestinal tract

extensive histochemical and immunohistochemical
studies in the mammalian gut have demonstrated the
presence of several populations of amine-containing
neurones that are likely to participate in the control of
gastrointestinal motility. these populations include
noradrenergic neurones of extrinsic sympathetic origin,
which contain dopamine as a metabolic intermediate in
the formation of noradrenaline (norepinephrine).5 nevertheless, the considerable amount of dopamine formed
in the body and not converted into other catecholamines suggests the existence of a peripheral dopaminergic
system, independent of the sympathetic noradrenergic
system.9
the guinea-pig gastric corpus is a prototype tissue
releasing dopamine spontaneously at a rate similar to
that found in central dopaminergic neurones. dopamine
release is augmented by transmural electrical stimulation through a mechanism sensitive to tetrodotoxin (a

neuronal na+-channel blocker) and dependent on the
external ca2+ concentration, which suggests neuronal
release.10
in humans, the gastrointestinal tract, spleen and
pancreas produce substantial amounts of dopamine.6
a comparison of the amounts of dopamine and its
metabolites formed in mesenteric organs with the
amounts removed by the kidneys indicates that up to
46% of the dopamine formed in the body is not
metabolized to noradrenaline (norepinephrine). the
source of this considerable amount of dopamine is
partly represented by non-neuronal cells of a dopaminergic paracrine system in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract.6
dopamine receptors and gastrointestinal motility
dopamine and dopamine receptor agonists produce
inhibitory and excitatory effects on gastrointestinal
motility. inhibitory effects consist of the relaxation or
inhibition of contractions observed from the oesophagus
to the colon.4 an elegant demonstration of the ability of
dopamine to relax the gastric wall in vivo via activation
of dopamine receptors was carried out in conscious dogs
by valenzuela.11 excitatory effects, observed less frequently than relaxations, also occur in all parts of the
gut.4 both excitatory and inhibitory effects can be
mediated by the activation of dopamine receptors,
although a large body of evidence indicates a preferential (and sometimes exclusive) interaction of dopamine
with a- and/or b-adrenoceptors.
genes encoding five subtypes of dopaminergic receptors have been cloned and sequenced. these five
dopamine receptors belong to the superfamily of
g-protein-coupled receptors structurally characterized
by the presence of seven membrane-spanning regions
(transmembrane domains) which form the dopamine
binding site.
of these five receptor subtypes, d1 and d5 receptors
cluster into the d1-like subfamily because they have
80% homology of the amino acid sequences in the
transmembrane domains. similarly, because d2, d3 and
d4 receptors also share substantial homology, they are
classified as members of the d2-like subfamily.
the two subfamilies differ in that the activation of
d1-like receptors stimulates adenylate cyclase,
whereas the activation of d2-like receptors inhibits
adenylate cyclase, although the inhibitory effect on
transmitter release caused by  xxxg656xxx  stimulation

figure 1. schematic representation of
dopaminergic pathways and the effects of
dopamine in the upper gastrointestinal
tract. dopamine exerts a direct relaxant
effect by activating muscular d2 receptors
in the lower oesophageal sphincter and
stomach (fundus and antrum). furthermore, by inhibiting acetylcholine release
from intrinsic cholinergic motor neurones
via the activation of pre-junctional d2
receptors, dopamine exerts an indirect
inhibitory effect on the musculature. both
inhibitory effects are prevented by antidopaminergic prokinetics. gastrointestinal
prokinetics with mixed antidopaminergic/
serotonergic properties may facilitate
acetylcholine release by activating
pre-junctional excitatory  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.

is mediated by an increase in membrane potassium
conductance.12
the two classical populations of dopamine receptors
are present in the gut, namely the d1 and d2 receptors.
d1 receptors are mainly located on the effector cells
(post-junctionally), whereas d2 receptors are located
both post-junctionally and pre-junctionally. in the latter
case, they exert a negative modulatory effect on the
release of acetylcholine from intrinsic cholinergic nerve
terminals (figure 1).13
evidence indicating that dopamine plays a role in
gastrointestinal motility is also inferred from the
observation that dopamine receptor antagonists can
affect gut motor activity from the stomach to the colon.
 xxxd1927xxx , a selective  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, was
found to improve myogenically transmitted antroduodenal co-ordination in the guinea-pig.14 this antagonist
was also found to counteract the inhibitory effect of
dopamine on rat gastric motility,15 and the excitatory
effect of dopamine infusion on colonic motility in
healthy subjects.16 furthermore, sulpiride and  xxxd115xxx , two  xxxg656xxx  antagonists, blocked the antitransit effect caused by apomorphine (a dopamine
agonist) in the rat gastrointestinal tract,17 and the
stimulatory effect caused by a standard meal on colonic
ó 2004 blackwell publishing ltd, aliment pharmacol ther 19, 379–390

motility in patients with irritable bowel syndrome,18
respectively.
in animal models, the stimulation of dopamine d2
receptors (by means of apomorphine or dopamine itself)
at the level of the chemoreceptor trigger zone has been
widely used to characterize vomiting and its gastrointestinal motor correlates.19–21 emesis (i.e. the forceful
expulsion of the gastrointestinal contents through the
mouth) is a highly organized process orchestrated by the
vomiting centre (better termed ‘central pattern generator’), which receives inputs from several peripheral and
central sites (figure 1). vomiting involves a somatomotor response, which is accompanied by a number of
events (such as the gastrointestinal motor patterns
associated with emesis) controlled by the autonomic
nervous system. these motor correlates include: (i)
gastric relaxation, which starts several minutes before
the onset of the retrograde giant contraction (rgc) in
the small bowel,21 and is maximal at the time when the
rgc arrives in the antrum; (ii) a series of events
(intestinal motor inhibition and disruption of slow wave
activity) which prepares the occurrence of the
rgc;20, 22 this is a single contraction that begins midintestine and propagates orally along the upper small
bowel to the antrum at a speed of 5–10 cm/s and

382

m. tonini et al.

depends on an intact vagus nerve; (iii) post-rgc phasic
contractions, which follow the occurrence of the rgc in
the small bowel and antrum; (iv) post-rgc inhibition of
upper small bowel contractility. in animal models, these
motor correlates always accompany emesis, but may
also occur independently.20, 22
blockade of the retrograde motor events that accompany vomiting may contribute to the overall prokinetic
effect of antidopaminergic agents.
enteric  xxxg656xxx  blockade: mechanisms of prokinesia
the rationale for proposing antidopaminergic compounds as gastrointestinal prokinetics stems from the
observation that significant amounts of dopamine are
present in the gut wall of several mammals, where it
causes potent inhibition of motility: reduced lower
oesophageal sphincter tone, reduced gastric tone and
intragastric pressure and decreased antroduodenal coordination, partly through the activation of dopamine
d2 receptors.23 it is likely that the blockade of these
inhibitory receptors by selective antagonists results in a
gastroprokinetic effect (figure 1).
other mechanisms, however, have been claimed to
explain the prokinetic effect of compounds such as
 xxxd1927xxx  and clebopride. early studies showed that
dopamine inhibited electrically induced contractions in
guinea-pig stomach strips by activating a2-adrenoceptors.24 subsequently, dopamine was found to inhibit
tritiated acetylcholine release from the guinea-pig
stomach by activating a pre-junctional  xxxg656xxx , as
this effect was inhibited by  xxxd1927xxx  and two other
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists, haloperidol and sulpiride.25
these findings were confirmed in another study, in
which  xxxd1927xxx  was found to antagonize the
inhibitory effect of dopamine on tritiated acetylcholine
release, resulting in the stimulation of gastric muscle
contraction.26 lastly, clebopride was found to enhance
the contractility of the guinea-pig stomach by blocking
peripheral d2 receptors located on post-ganglionic
cholinergic neurones.27 thus, at least in animal studies,
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists may exert their prokinetic
activity by facilitating acetylcholine release from intrinsic cholinergic motor neurones (i.e. through a procholinergic effect) (figure 1). however, in isolated
preparations of human stomach,  xxxd1927xxx  failed to
show any pro-cholinergic activity, casting some doubt
on the peripheral mode of action of this compound in
humans.28

mixed antidopaminergic/serotonergic prokinetics
among marketed gastrointestinal prokinetics (table 1),
 xxxd1927xxx  is a butyrophenone derivative, whereas
 xxxd374xxx , clebopride, levosulpiride and metoclopramide are substituted benzamides.  xxxd115xxx  is also
included in the anatomic therapeutic classification
group a03fa (prokinetics): however, it is used only as
an anti-emetic and will not be considered further in this
review. all the aforementioned agents are endowed with
antagonist properties at dopamine d2 receptors (affinity
values at the  xxxg656xxx  are reported in table 1).29–37
two benzamide prokinetics, metoclopramide and levosulpiride, are known to interact with serotonergic
receptors (table 1). metoclopramide has moderate partial 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 ( xxxg1117xxx ) receptor agonist
properties and moderate  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
properties,13 whereas levosulpiride has moderate partial
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist properties and an extremely
weak 5-ht3 antagonism.38 it has been suggested
that the activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors by metoclopramide and levosulpiride contributes to their gastrointestinal prokinetic action by enhancing acetylcholine
release from intrinsic cholinergic motor neurones

sales of metoclopramide of 18% and 9%, respectively). in
the usa, where  xxxd1708xxx  was withdrawn in 2000, an
increased use of metoclopramide has been reported.41
thus, since the withdrawal (or use restriction) of
 xxxd1708xxx , the treatment of upper gut motility disorders
has rested mainly on antidopaminergic prokinetics,
because alternative  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists are not
marketed in the european union (mosapride is marketed in japan).
although a detailed survey of all clinical trials of
antidopaminergic prokinetics is beyond the scope of this
paper, we provide below an overview of the three most
widely used antidopaminergic prokinetics ( xxxd1927xxx , metoclopramide and levosulpiride).42–45 for the
less widely used compounds (clebopride and  xxxd374xxx , which are marketed only in some countries), the
reader is referred to existing clinical reports.46–50
it should be pointed out that only rarely have metaanalyses and systematic reviews on the effectiveness
of prokinetics in treating gastrointestinal disorders

regarded as the main mechanism of the prokinetic effect
of these agents, as dopamine has marked inhibitory
effects on gastrointestinal motility (reduction of the
lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, gastric relaxation
and inhibition of gastro-duodenal co-ordination). they
are mostly used for the treatment of motility disorders of
the upper digestive tract, such as functional dyspepsia
and gastric stasis of various origins, including diabetic
gastroparesis, and in the prevention of nausea and
vomiting. there has been renewed interest in antidopaminergic prokinetics after the world-wide withdrawal
of  xxxd1708xxx  because of the well-known cardiac safety
issues.40 the sharp decrease in the sales of  xxxd1708xxx  has
been accompanied by a trend towards an increase in
sales of other prokinetics (figure 2). in italy, a country
with a relatively high consumption of prokinetics, sales
of drugs other than  xxxd1708xxx  (namely  xxxd1927xxx ,
clebopride and levosulpiride) have increased by about
39%. the same trend has been observed in other
countries, such as norway and finland (increase in

included antidopaminergics, because of the poor quality
of existing clinical trials. for the use of antidopaminergics in dyspepsia, moayyedi et al. suggested further
research to conclusively establish their place in therapy.51 concerning gastroparesis, sturm et al. found that
 xxxd1927xxx  was better than metoclopramide, but
again suggested further comparative trials to include
all available options.52
veldhuyzen van zanten et al. performed a metaanalysis to determine the efficacy of  xxxd1927xxx  in
functional dyspepsia.53 efficacy analysis was based on
the global assessment of improvement by the investigator. an odds ratio of 7.0 (95% confidence interval,
3.6–16) favoured  xxxd1927xxx  vs. placebo. thus,
 xxxd1927xxx  seems to be efficacious in functional
dyspepsia, although this conclusion was largely based
on global assessment by the investigator, which is not
an optimal outcome measure.
it has been suggested that serotonergic prokinetics
(e.g.  xxxd1708xxx , mosapride) may be superior to antidopaminergic agents with regard to prokinetic effects,54
and that the serotonergic ( xxxg1117xxx ) component possessed
by some antidopaminergic benzamides (e.g. levosulpiride, metoclopramide) may enhance their therapeutic
efficacy in the gastrointestinal tract.38 indeed, in a
multi-centre, double-blind, controlled trial enrolling
1298 patients with functional dyspepsia, levosulpiride
was more effective than  xxxd1927xxx , metoclopramide
and placebo.55 furthermore, in a small study on
30 patients with functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis,
levosulpiride was found to be as effective as  xxxd1708xxx  in
shortening the time of gastric emptying and improving
symptom scores.56
visceral hypersensitivity plays a role in some dyspeptic
patients and this abnormality is also a potential target
for treatment.57 the hypothesis that at least some
antidopaminergic agents may affect visceral sensitivity
by acting at some level along the brain–gut axis has
already been put forward by bradette et al. in a trial
with  xxxd1927xxx .58 more recently, distrutti et al.
investigated whether levosulpiride modulated gastric
sensitivity and compliance in eight healthy subjects and
16 patients with functional dyspepsia,59 defined according to the rome ii criteria,60 who underwent graded
gastric distensions using a tensostat. although healthy
subjects and dyspeptic patients had similar gastric
compliance, the latter tolerated lower tension levels.
at the same distending tension levels, levosulpiride
significantly decreased the perception score (38%

change) only in dyspeptic patients. a 4-week treatment
with levosulpiride significantly reduced dyspeptic symptoms and increased the discomfort threshold. no
comparable studies are available in the published
literature with other antidopaminergic agents.
use as anti-emetics
antidopaminergic agents have been widely used (and
still are) as anti-emetics for the prevention of nausea
and vomiting during pregnancy, cancer chemotherapy,
following surgery (post-operative nausea and vomiting)
and during a migraine attack. the prominent mechanism of action is the blockade of dopamine d2 receptors in
the area postrema and vomiting centre (figure 1).61
the use of antidopaminergic agents as anti-emetics
was greatly reduced after the introduction of 5-ht3
receptor antagonists (the so-called setrons: ondansetron, granisetron,  xxxd3451xxx ,  xxxd1924xxx , etc.), which
were marketed as potent and selective agents for the
prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.62 however, setrons are extremely effective in
chemotherapy-induced acute emesis (i.e. emesis occurring within 24–36 h following therapy), but do not
adequately control tardive emesis, which may occur
3–5 days following chemotherapy. in the latter case,
combination therapy with setrons and dexamethasone
or antidopaminergics ( xxxd1927xxx , levosulpiride,
metoclopramide) may be superior to monotherapy.63
the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting
with various agents, including antidopaminergic prokinetics, is under review by the cochrane library.
antidopaminergics that do not cross the blood–brain
barrier ( xxxd1927xxx ) can be specifically used to
prevent l-dopa-induced emesis in patients with parkinson’s disease, as they prevent the stimulatory action
of dopamine (derived from l-dopa metabolism) at
d2 receptors in the area postrema, which is located
outside the barrier.64
finally, the rationale for using anti-emetic/prokinetic
agents during a migraine attack rests mainly on their
anti-emetic properties.22 the prokinetic effect is also
clinically useful, as it allows faster absorption of  xxxd2022xxx  agents65, 66 (gastric emptying is delayed
during a migraine attack) and may also counteract
the occurrence of the gastrointestinal motor correlates
of vomiting (gastric relaxation, inhibition of intestinal
motility), which may be viewed as events priming the
afferent pathway of the emetic reflex.

review: antidopaminergic prokinetics

extra-intestinal (central) targets of
antidopaminergic prokinetics

dopamine-containing neurones are found in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and hypothalamic
nucleus. smaller groups of neurones are found in the
retina and olfactory bulb.
the substantia nigra neurones project to the subcortical structures, caudate nucleus and putamen (striatum). nigrostriatal pathways, involved in the control of
movements, represent about 80% of brain dopaminergic
neurones. hypothalamic dopaminergic neurones project to the pituitary gland, thus forming the tuberoinfundibular pathway, the functional role of which is to
suppress prolactin excretion by activating d2 receptors
on lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary.67
the blockade of central d2 receptors may cause
extrapyramidal reactions and hyperprolactinaemia.
the most frequent types of drug-induced movement
(extrapyramidal) disorders are parkinsonism or akinesia
(a reversible syndrome characterized by muscle rigidity,
bradykinesia and tremor), acute dystonic reactions or
dyskinesias (consisting of spasmodic or sustained involuntary contractions of muscles in the face, neck, trunk
and occasionally the extremities) and tardive dyskinesia, which are mainly (although not exclusively)
caused by drugs with antagonist properties at the d2
receptor, such as anti-psychotics (neuroleptics) and
substituted benzamide derivatives used in gastroenterology. by suppressing a dopamine-induced inhibitory
restraint on prolactin secretion, the same classes of
drugs invariably evoke hyperprolactinaemia independently of their ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, as
the pituitary is outside the barrier.
extrapyramidal reactions
all prokinetics with  xxxg656xxx  antagonist properties
have been found to induce extrapyramidal reactions,
although to different extents. usually, extrapyramidal
symptoms occur more frequently in women than in
men and more frequently in children and the elderly
than in adults. their incidence is enhanced in patients
receiving high intravenous doses during anti-emetic
therapy.
 xxxd1927xxx  does not readily cross the blood–brain
barrier, and therefore the incidence of extrapyramidal
symptoms is rare;68, 69 nevertheless, several case reports
have been published,70–72 including dystonic reactions
ó 2004 blackwell publishing ltd, aliment pharmacol ther 19, 379–390

385

in children.71, 72 it is likely that the occurrence of
neurological side-effects in children reflects an immature
(i.e. more permeable) blood–brain barrier.
with regard to substituted benzamide derivative
prokinetics, clebopride is the drug that is most associated
with the occurrence of dystonic reactions.47, 48, 73–76 in
one study, the high incidence and severity of adverse
effects led to the withdrawal of clebopride therapy in 11
of a total of 34 patients.77 chronic treatment with
clebopride may be associated not only with reversible
parkinsonian-like symptoms (involuntary movements of
the tongue and mouth, blepharospasm, trismus, torticollis, resting tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia in both
arms and legs), but also with tardive dyskinesia,78
which is potentially irreversible.79 the calculated
prevalence of movement disorders associated with the
chronic use of clebopride is 4%.80 for the other
substituted benzamide derivatives, dystonic reactions
at recommended clinical dosages occur in about 1% of
patients with metoclopramide,81, 82 and in less than 1%
with both bromopride50, 83 and levosulpiride.55, 84–87
reversible and irreversible tardive dyskinesia has been
reported with the chronic use of metoclopramide.88
chronic treatment with  xxxd374xxx  may be associated
with facial paraesthesia.89
differences between prokinetics. before discussing the
differences between antidopaminergic prokinetics in
eliciting extrapyramidal reactions, it is useful to refer
to the information available from another class of d2
antidopaminergic agents, i.e. the neuroleptics. extrapyramidal reactions by neuroleptics depend on the affinity
values for the  xxxg656xxx . anti-psychotics with dissociation constants below 1 nm ( xxxd3431xxx , chlorpromazine, thioridazine, haloperidol, fluphenazine,
risperidone and raclopride) bind tightly to the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  and thus readily elicit extrapyramidal signs
and symptoms. a second group has dissociation constants between 1.5 and 7 nm (molindone,  xxxd2511xxx ,
olanzapine and  xxxd3195xxx ), close to the dissociation
constant of dopamine (i.e. 2–7 nm) for the high-affinity
state of the  xxxg656xxx . thus, the competition between
these anti-psychotics and endogenous dopamine is in
balance, leading to mild or dose-dependent levels of
parkinsonism. a third group (the so-called atypical
neuroleptics, such as quetiapine and clozapine) has high
dissociation constants (between 10 and 100 nm), binds
loosely to d2 receptors and elicits only minimal
extrapyramidal side-effects.90, 91

m. tonini et al.

with regard to prokinetics,  xxxd1927xxx  and clebopride have a high affinity value at the  xxxg656xxx 
(ki approximately 2 nm; table 1). this may explain the
higher incidence of extrapyramidal reactions with
clebopride, whereas the relative safety of  xxxd1927xxx 
is probably due to its poor penetration of the blood–
brain barrier. by contrast, the affinity value of  xxxd374xxx , levosulpiride and metoclopramide is > 10 nm
(table 1).34, 37 levosulpiride is the only agent within
this class of compounds that is used as a neuroleptic
agent, although at dosages higher (200–300 mg daily)
than those used in gastroenterology (25 mg t.d.s.). it
has some characteristics (stimulating activity at low
doses and sedative effects only at very high doses, due to
the blockade of central pre-synaptic autoreceptors and
post-synaptic d2 receptors, respectively) that set it apart
as a mainly atypical neuroleptic agent.90, 92 this is
probably the reason why levosulpiride has only a low
potential to induce extrapyramidal side-effects at the
doses used in gastroenterology. the higher incidence
observed with metoclopramide, compared with levosulpiride or  xxxd374xxx , probably reflects the fact that
metoclopramide is extensively used at high dosages
(both orally and intravenously) as an anti-emetic agent.
hyperprolactinaemia
hyperprolactinaemia with associated alterations, such
as gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea and
impotence, has been described in response to dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  blockade by gastrointestinal prokinetics.
these side-effects occur irrespective of the ability of the
drug to cross the blood–brain barrier, as the pituitary is
outside the barrier.
several reports of mastalgia and galactorrhoea have
been reported with  xxxd1927xxx .93–95 most cases were
associated with elevated prolactin levels and occurred
within 3 days to 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy;
however, the onset of milk discharge has occurred after
36 h of treatment.94, 96 hyperprolactinaemia and related disorders have been documented for  xxxd374xxx ,97
clebopride,98, 99 levosulpiride,84, 100 and metoclopramide,101 either after oral or intravenous administration.
in a large, multi-centre, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial of 408 dyspeptic patients treated with
oral levosulpiride, 25 mg t.d.s. for 4 weeks, the total
incidence of hyperprolactinaemia and related disorders
was 7% in female patients.55 no studies of comparable
size are available for the other prokinetics.

generally, hyperprolactinaemia tends to decrease
during the chronic administration of antidopaminergic
prokinetics. on discontinuation, galactorrhoea usually
ceases within 1 week.
differences between prokinetics. in a comparative study,
the four substituted benzamide derivatives,  xxxd374xxx ,
clebopride, metoclopramide and the racemic compound,
sulpiride, administered orally at a clinically comparable
dosage, all enhanced serum prolactin levels in healthy
women. the rank order of the potency of these compounds was as follows: metoclopramide (+ 185%) >
 xxxd374xxx  (+ 155%) > sulpiride (+ 125%) > clebopride (+ 65%). separate studies with intramuscular or
oral  xxxd1927xxx  indicated that the drug had the same
potency as metoclopramide in inducing prolactin
release.102–104 based on these findings, it is unlikely that
the different prolactin levels caused by the various
antagonists are due to different affinities at the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx , as  xxxd1927xxx  and clebopride have com1 parable affinities (see table 1). it is also unlikely that the
various antagonists can differently modulate the release
of dopamine from the tuberoinfundibular pathway, as
dopamine d2 autoreceptors are absent in this pathway.67
dopamine released from terminals of tuberoinfundibular
neurones in the median eminence does not enter a
synapse, but diffuses through fenestrated capillaries and
is transported through the hypophysial portal blood to
the anterior pituitary, where it activates d2 receptors on
lactotrophs and tonically inhibits prolactin release from
these cells.
recently, the different propensity of atypical antipsychotics to cause prolactin elevation was explained
by the differential occupancy of d2 receptors in the
striatum vs. the pituitary. compounds displaying a
higher peripheral potency brought about higher prolactin levels for a given level of functional central
antagonism. this was the case for  xxxd155xxx  and
risperidone, two anti-psychotics commonly associated
with prolactin elevation, and not for quetiapine and
olanzapine, two compounds less frequently associated.105
this explanation, together with pharmacokinetic factors,
including oral bioavailability, distribution and drug
disposition, probably also applies to antidopaminergic
substituted benzamide prokinetics and  xxxd1927xxx .
although an increased prolactin level is generally
considered as a side-effect, this effect could be exploited
clinically as an aid in initiating and maintaining adequate
milk production in the case of breast lactation.106

review: antidopaminergic prokinetics
place of antidopaminergics in
gastrointestinal therapy

antidopaminergics, together with serotonergic agents
acting as agonists at the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor, are the drugs
currently available for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal motor disorders related to functional dyspepsia,
gastric stasis and emesis. after the withdrawal of
 xxxd1708xxx  because of its cardiotoxicity,40 the interest in
antidopaminergic prokinetics increased considerably. of
the available agents, those possessing mixed antidopaminergic/serotonergic ( xxxg1117xxx ) properties, associated
with a mild propensity to induce central side-effects,
seem to offer better clinical outcomes.55
the availability of antidopaminergics on the market
varies in different european countries. only metoclopramide is widely available and, in northern
european countries, is the only marketed prokinetic
(apart from  xxxd1708xxx , which may still be prescribed
for restricted use). in italy, germany and spain,
antidopaminergics include several agents, such as
metoclopramide,  xxxd1927xxx , levosulpiride, clebopride and  xxxd115xxx .
although antidopaminergics are useful as anti-emetics
and prokinetics in upper gut motor disorders, there are
still some unmet needs. first, there are subgroups of
dyspeptic patients who do not respond to antidopaminergics. novel serotonergic agents, such as  xxxd3302xxx ,
already available in several countries (not yet in the
european union), and  xxxd3039xxx , have been developed as prokinetics of the lower gastrointestinal tract for
the management of patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and functional
constipation, respectively. however, their role in the
management of upper gut disorders remains to be
determined.
second, although new classes of prokinetics are
awaited, there is a need, in our opinion, for large
comparative trials of antidopaminergic and serotonergic
agents in patients with dyspepsia, defined according to
the rome ii criteria,60 in order to reassess the daily
dosing, clinical efficacy and safety profile.
