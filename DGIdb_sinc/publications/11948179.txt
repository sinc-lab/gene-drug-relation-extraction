the abbreviations used are: atic, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/ xxxd557xxx  cyclohydrolase; aicar, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide;  xxxg209xxx ,
aicar formyltransferase; 10-ffh4, n10-formyltetrahydrofolate; faicar,

tional enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate and final steps in
the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. aicar
formyl transferase ( xxxg209xxx ) catalyzes the transfer of the
formyl group from a reduced folate cofactor, n10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-ffh4), to the exocyclic amino group of the purine
precursor, aicar, to form 5-formylaminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (faicar). imp cyclohydrolase (impch) catalyzes the subsequent ring closure reaction to form imp and a
molecule of water (fig. 1). these activities are located in separate
domains of the atic protein. the  xxxg209xxx  activity is located in
a larger c-terminal region, and the impch activity resides in a
smaller n-terminal region (1).
two forms of atic have been found in human cells. the form
described by rayl et al. (1), which we term hatic-a,2 differs
from the form (hatic-b) described by sugita et al. (2) and
yamauchi et al. (3) only in the six n-terminal amino acids and
a single amino acid substitution at position 165.3 because of
the likelihood that hatic-b is the predominant form expressed
in human tissues (2), this isoform was used to perform all of the
experiments described here.
interest in atic stems in part from its potential as a chemotherapeutic target.  xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide transformylase, the third enzyme activity in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, and the  xxxg209xxx  activity of atic each
require the same reduced folate cofactor, which makes them
potential targets for the antifolate class of chemotherapeutic
agents. (6r)-5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate (ddathf, lometrexol) is a potent antiproliferative agent that functions
through the inhibition of  xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide transformylase. the (6s) diastereomer of ddathf inhibits both
 xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide transformylase and  xxxg209xxx  activities (4 –7). the actions of certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of the
antifolate methotrexate, have been attributed in part to the
inhibition of  xxxg209xxx  (8 –10).
atic is the only enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of
purine nucleotides that is bifunctional in every organism studied. this apparent evolutionary conservation raises the question of whether there may be a functional advantage to this
structural arrangement. perhaps the intermediate, faicar, is
transferred directly from the  xxxg209xxx  site to the impch site
formylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide; impch, imp cyclohydrolase; hatic, human atic; hplc, high performance liquid chromatography; thf, tetrahydrofolate; tlc, thin layer chromatography.

initial transient kinetic studies on hatic-a by rayl and co-workers
have been described previously (27).

because of the additional amino acid in the n terminus of hatic-b,
the glycine to aspartate difference is at position 165 in hatic-b and at
position 164 in hatic-a.

5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/imp cyclohydrolase (atic) is a bifunctional
protein possessing two enzymatic activities that sequentially catalyze the last two steps in the pathway for de
novo synthesis of inosine 5ⴕ-monophosphate. this bifunctional enzyme is of particular interest because of its potential as a chemotherapeutic target. furthermore, these
two catalytic activities reside on the same protein
throughout all of nature, raising the question of whether
there is some kinetic advantage to the bifunctionality.
rapid chemical quench, stopped-flow absorbance, and
steady-state kinetic techniques were used to elucidate the
complete kinetic mechanism of human atic. the kinetic
simulation program kinsim was used to model the kinetic data obtained in this study. the detailed kinetic
analysis, in combination with kinetic simulations, provided the following key features of the enzyme reaction
pathway. 1) the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction
(2.9 ⴞ 0.4 sⴚ1) is likely the release of tetrahydrofolate from
the formyltransferase active site or a conformational
change associated with tetrahydrofolate release. 2) the
rate of the reverse transformylase reaction (6.7 sⴚ1) is
⬃2–3-fold faster than the forward rate (2.9 sⴚ1), whereas
the cyclohydrolase reaction is essentially unidirectional
in the forward sense. the cyclohydrolase reaction thus
draws the overall bifunctional reaction toward the
production of  xxxd557xxx . 3) there was no
kinetic evidence of substrate channeling of the intermediate, the formylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide, between the formyltransferase and the cyclohydrolase active sites.

experimental procedures

expression and purification of human atic—the previously described plasmid, petatic-b (21), was transformed into e. coli tunertm

(de3)(novagen) by heat shock. e. coli transformants were grown in
2yt bacterial media with 50 ␮g/ml kanamycin at 37 °c to an a600 value
of 0.6 – 0.8. the cultures were then induced with 400 ␮m isopropyl-1thio-␤-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 30 °c for 3 h. the cells were
harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.85% nacl, and either
stored at ⫺80 °c or used immediately. the purification of human atic
was carried out as described previously (21).
synthesis of [3h]faicar—[3h]aicar was purchased from moravek
biochemicals and converted enzymatically to [3h]faicar. hatic (100
␮m) was incubated under single turnover conditions (50 ␮m [3h]aicar
and 300 ␮m 10-ffh4). samples of the reaction mixture were collected at
time points early in the course of the reaction (100 ms). these samples
were pooled and lyophilized to dryness. the reaction products were
separated by hplc using a whatman 10-␮m sax anion exchange
column eluted isocratically with 10 mm kh2po4, ph 2.5, at 1 ml/min.
the retention times for standards were as follows: aicar, 8.1 min;
faicar, 12.9 min; and imp, 15.9 min. the [3h]faicar peak was
collected, lyophilized, and redissolved in a suitable amount of 50 mm
ammonium acetate to be further purified by reverse phase hplc.
the reverse phase hplc was performed using a 7-␮m adsorbosphere nucleotide-nucleoside reverse phase column (alltech associates)
eluted isocratically with a mobile phase consisting of 50 mm ammonium
acetate, ph 7.0, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and 10% methanol at 1 ml/min. the retention time for the faicar standard was 6.9
min, whereas aicar and imp standards co-eluted  xxxd1891xxx  min. the
[3h]faicar peak was collected and lyophilized to remove ammonium
acetate. the pure [3h]faicar was dissolved in water and stored as
aliquots at ⫺20 °c until needed.
steady-state spectrophotometric assays—all steady-state spectrophotometric assays were performed using a perkinelmer lambda 2
spectrophotometer and perkinelmer pecss computerized spectroscopy data acquisition software. all reaction mixtures were 500 ␮l in
volume and were carried out in 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvettes at
room temperature unless otherwise noted.
for the standard  xxxg209xxx  assay, reaction mixtures contained final
concentrations of 66 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 50 mm kcl, 100 ␮m aicar
(sigma), and 300 ␮m 10-ffh4. the reaction was initiated by the addition
of hatic (typically 10 –500 nm final concentration). the reactions were
monitored by observing the formation of thf at 298 nm by a method
described previously (22, 23). 10-ffh4 was synthesized from (6s)-5formyl- xxxd3334xxx  (schircks laboratories) by a previously described method (1, 24, 25).
for the standard reverse  xxxg209xxx  assay, the buffer concentrations
were the same as for the forward direction. substrate concentration
ranges were 5–500 ␮m faicar and 10 –500 ␮m thf. the reactions
were monitored by observing the disappearance of thf as a decrease in
absorbance at 298 nm by the same method as for the forward direction,
described above. faicar was synthesized from aicar according to a
published procedure (22).
for the standard impch assay, reaction mixtures contained final
concentrations of 100 mm tris-cl, ph 7.5, and 100 ␮m faicar. hatic
was then added to a final concentration of 10 –500 nm to initiate the
reaction. the reactions were monitored by observing the appearance of
imp as an increase in absorbance at 248 nm (22).
rapid chemical quench experiments—experiments were carried
out using a kintek威 rqf-3 rapid chemical quench apparatus (kintek
instruments). reactions were initiated by mixing 15 ␮l of enzyme with
15 ␮l of substrate solution containing [3h]aicar (labeled nonspecifically by tritium exchange, 10 –20 ci/mmol, moravek biochemicals) and
unlabeled 10-ffh4 or by mixing 15 ␮l of enzyme with 15 ␮l of substrate
solution containing [3h]faicar in a reaction buffer consisting of 50
mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, ph 8.0, 50 mm kcl, and 5 mm
␤- xxxd26xxx . in all cases, concentrations cited in the text correspond to concentrations after mixing and during the enzymatic reaction. reaction times ranged from 3 ms to 2 s. all rapid chemical quench

without diffusing through bulk solution. the process of the
direct transfer of an intermediate has been termed substrate
channeling. this phenomenon has been demonstrated to occur
with several multifunctional enzymes (11–14) as well as with
complexes of enzymes that associate but are not covalently
connected (15). the advantages conferred by substrate channeling may include the maximization of efficiency in the use of
metabolites in a pathway and the transfer of very unstable or
volatile products that would have a very short half-life in bulk
solution.
among the best characterized examples of substrate channeling are those for which there is both kinetic evidence of
channeling and a clear structural basis for the process (16).
such examples include tryptophan synthase (11), the bifunctional  xxxg2366xxx / xxxg631xxx  from
leishmania major (12), and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase
(17).
there are at least two cases of apparent substrate channeling in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. the
first enzyme in the pathway,  xxxg1808xxx , catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate plus nh3 and the transfer of the nh3 to
 xxxd2937xxx , forming phosphoribosylamine.
structural and kinetic studies of the enzyme from escherichia
coli have shown that the two steps are carried out at separate
sites and that the nh3 is transferred through a transient 20 å
hydrophobic channel (13, 14).
the second case for which there is evidence of substrate
channeling in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway occurs between the first and second enzymes in the pathway,  xxxg1808xxx  and  xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide synthetase, respectively.
kinetic evidence suggests that the unstable intermediate,
phosphoribosylamine, must be channeled directly from the first
enzyme to the second, although attempts to isolate a complex
between the two enzymes have thus far been unsuccessful (15).
bifunctional atic seemed to be a strong candidate for substrate channeling based on its conservation of bifunctionality
throughout nature as well as its role in a metabolic pathway.
the use of steady-state isotope dilution experiments and substrate analogs of aicar have provided indirect evidence suggesting that channeling of faicar does not occur with atic
(18 –20). in this report, we have addressed the question of
substrate channeling directly using a transient kinetic approach that includes rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow
methodologies. this strategy has several advantages in examining substrate channeling because it allows one to directly
monitor chemical catalysis at each active site as well as the
transit of the putative intermediate or metabolite from one
active site to another through the use of single turnover kinetic
analysis. using this approach, we provide a complete kinetic
description of the reaction pathway for the atic enzyme as
well as definitive evidence for the lack of substrate channeling.

results

steady-state kinetics of hatic—the steady-state spectrophotometric assays for  xxxg209xxx  and impch activities were
used to determine kcat and km values for the substrates of these
activities. the results are shown in table i. the km values for
aicar and 10-ffh4 were similar to the values previously
reported for this enzyme (1, 2). the km value for faicar at the
impch site is necessarily an approximation because the spectrophotometric assay lacks the sensitivity to accurately determine values less than 1 ␮m (22). the value obtained was similar to previously reported results (1, 22). steady-state
chemical quench techniques were also used to determine kcat
values (not shown), and the values obtained were in good
agreement with the values obtained spectrophotometrically.
substrate binding to the aicart active site—it has been

previously reported by ourselves (21) and others (20) that the
human  xxxg209xxx  activity exhibits a pre-steady-state burst of
faicar formation, suggesting that the rate-limiting step is
determined, at least in part, by a step occurring after chemical
catalysis. these results were confirmed by the use of both rapid
chemical quench and stopped-flow absorbance. in all cases, the
amplitude of the burst phase was nearly equal to the concentration of enzyme used in the experiments, indicating that close
to 100% of the  xxxg209xxx  catalytic sites were active at the atic
concentrations used in these experiments (20, 21).
to determine the apparent binding constants for aicar and
10-ffh4 at the  xxxg209xxx  active site, a series of pre-steadystate burst experiments was performed to determine the substrate concentration dependence of the pre-steady-state burst
rate. stopped-flow absorbance was used in these burst experiments to monitor the appearance of thf at 298 nm on a short
time scale (⬍1 s)(fig. 2). this type of experiment was carried
out with varying concentrations of one substrate while keeping
the other substrate constant under saturating conditions. to
examine 10-ffh4 binding, pre-steady-state burst experiments
were performed in which aicar was maintained at a concentration of 200 ␮m, and the concentration of 10-ffh4 was varied
from 40 ␮m to 1 mm. to examine aicar binding, the 10-ffh4
concentration was kept at 500 ␮m, and aicar was varied from
5–200 ␮m. the exponential rates from the burst curves (fast
phase) were plotted versus substrate concentration, and in each
case the resulting curve was fit to a hyperbola from which
apparent binding constants were directly obtained. the apparent binding constant for 10-ffh4 was found to be 105 ⫾ 7 ␮m,
and for aicar it was 22 ⫾ 4 ␮m.
substrate binding in the reverse  xxxg209xxx  reaction—a presteady-state burst experiment was performed for the reverse
 xxxg209xxx  reaction using stopped-flow absorbance. the reaction was initiated by mixing 10 ␮m hatic with a substrate
solution containing 300 ␮m faicar and 300 ␮m thf. we
monitored the disappearance of thf as a decrease in absorbance at 298 nm as it was converted to 10-ffh4 (and faicar
was converted to aicar). in the reverse direction, no presteady-state burst phase was observed (fig. 3), suggesting that
the rate of chemical catalysis is at least partially rate-limiting.
the steady-state spectrophotometric assay was used to determine the km for faicar and tetrahydrofolate at the
 xxxg209xxx  active site. the km for tetrahydrofolate was determined to be 185 ⫾ 27 ␮m. the km for faicar at the  xxxg209xxx 
active site was estimated to be ⬍3.9 ⫾ 1.3 ␮m. the spectrophotometric assay was not sensitive enough to detect accurate
observed rates for faicar concentrations under 5 ␮m because
assays at these lower concentrations are complicated by the
simultaneous depletion of faicar by the impch activity. a
selective inhibitor of the impch activity was not available at
the time of these experiments. the maximum steady-state rate
of catalysis in the reverse direction was calculated as 6.7 ⫾ 0.6
s⫺1, which is faster than the steady-state rate in the forward
direction (2.9 ⫾ 0.4 s⫺1).
investigation of substrate channeling—to investigate the
possibility of substrate channeling between the two active sites
of atic, we needed to determine whether the product from the
first reaction, faicar, is transferred directly from the

experiments were performed at 37 °c unless otherwise noted. reactions
were quenched with 67 ␮l of triethylamine or 67 ␮l of 0.5 m  xxxd2154xxx 
and collected in 1.5-ml tubes containing 70 ␮l of chloroform. the tubes
were immediately vortexed and kept on ice until all of the samples in
the set were collected. samples were then centrifuged at 3000 ⫻ g for 10
min to separate the aqueous and organic phases. the aqueous phase
was transferred to a clean tube, lyophilized, and redissolved in 8 ␮l of
h2o for subsequent tlc separation on polygram威 cel 300 polyethyleneimine/uv254 tlc plates (macherey-nagel, gmbh). tlc separation of substrates and products was performed by a modification of
the method described previously (18).
stopped-flow absorbance—stopped-flow absorbance experiments
were performed with a kintek威 sf-2001 (kintek instruments)
stopped-flow fluorescence/absorbance apparatus. this apparatus has a
1.5-ms dead time, a 0.5-cm path length, and a thermostatted observation cell that was maintained at 25 °c. for the  xxxg209xxx  reaction in the
forward direction, 20 ␮l of hatic (5–20 ␮m) was mixed with 20 ␮l of a
substrate solution containing aicar (5–200 ␮m) and 10-ffh4 (from 40
␮m to 1 mm). for the reverse  xxxg209xxx  reaction, 20 ␮l of hatic (from
5 to 20 ␮m) was mixed with 20 ␮l of a substrate solution containing
faicar (300 ␮m) and thf (from 40 ␮m to 1 mm). reactions were
monitored at 298 nm (absorbance maximum for thf) for the appearance or disappearance of thf on a time scale of up to 2 s. most
experiments were performed under pre-steady-state burst conditions,
and an average of 4 –5 runs were used for data analysis. the data were
collected over a given time interval by a computer using data acquisition and analysis software provided by kintek instruments. data were
fit to a single exponential or burst equation by nonlinear regression.
the combination of rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow methods
allowed an accurate interpretation of absorbance signals.
data analysis and kinetic modeling—the rate constants for individual single turnover rapid chemical quench experiments were determined by fitting the data to a single or double exponential using the
curve-fitting program kaleidagraph (synergy software). the dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rate on substrate concentrations was
plotted and fit to a hyperbolic equation to obtain the apparent binding
constants for aicar and 10-ffh4. using the rate constants and binding
constants obtained from these measurements as well as the steadystate parameters determined here as constraints, we then sought to
provide a kinetic model that would be consistent with all of the kinetic
measurements and possibly provide insights into substrate channeling
and/or domain-domain interactions.
the kinetic simulation program kinsim (26) was used to model the
kinetic data. the data from single turnover experiments were entered
as x y pairs and were fit by a trial and error process using the rate
constants obtained from the exponential fits of single turnover experiments and the binding constants, km values, and kcat values obtained in
this study. the focus of the modeling was to ascertain, with the rate
constants obtained experimentally, whether it was necessary to invoke
a channeling step to explain any of the kinetic data.

 xxxg209xxx  site to the impch site and not allowed to dissociate
from the enzyme. this was done by a series of three single
turnover rapid chemical quench experiments performed as illustrated in fig. 4.
the first experiment established the rate of catalysis of the
 xxxg209xxx  activity under single turnover conditions as designated in reaction 1 in fig. 4. hatic (80 ␮m) was mixed with
excess 10-ffh4 (500 ␮m) and a limiting amount of [3h]aicar
(20 ␮m). the decoupling of the bifunctional reaction is complicated by the fact that faicar is the single substrate for the
impch activity. in this experiment both [3h]faicar and
[3h]imp were formed and detected by tlc. to obtain the rate
of faicar formation, the total concentration of product formed
(faicar plus imp, because any imp present was formed via
faicar) was plotted versus time, and the resulting curve was
fit to a single exponential. the time course for the formation of
[3h]faicar is shown in fig. 5. under these conditions, the
rate of catalysis was 62 ⫾ 4 s⫺1. there was no change in this

rate under conditions in which the enzyme concentration was
significantly increased, indicating that substrate binding was
not rate limiting in these experiments.
the second set of single turnover experiments was designed
to examine the impch activity of bifunctional atic as designated in reaction 2 in fig. 4. hatic (40 ␮m) was mixed with a
limiting amount of [3h]faicar (20 ␮m). the time course for
the formation of [3h]imp is shown in fig. 6. interestingly, this
curve was biphasic and fit best to a double exponential. the
first phase had an amplitude of 8.4 ⫾ 0.8 ␮m and a rate of 40 ⫾
6 s⫺1. this is likely the rate of catalysis in a single turnover of
impch activity. the second phase had an amplitude of 10 ⫾ 1
␮m and a rate of 2.3 ⫾ 0.7 s⫺1, which was similar to but slightly
slower than the steady-state rate of imp formation from
faicar of 6.0 s⫺1 (table i).
the third set of single turnover experiments was designed to
directly measure the rate of conversion of aicar to faicar at
the  xxxg209xxx  active site and the subsequent conversion of
faicar to imp at the impch active site (designated as reaction 3 in fig. 4). if faicar dissociates from the  xxxg209xxx 
active site and rebinds at the impch active site, it is probable
that it would be detected as an intermediate in the bifunctional
reaction. however, if faicar is channeled directly from the
 xxxg209xxx  active site to the impch active site, it is unlikely to
accumulate during the time course of the overall bifunctional
reaction. in these experiments, which were set up in essentially
the same manner as the first set of experiments, hatic (80 ␮m)

was mixed with excess 10-ffh4 (500 ␮m) and limiting concentrations of [3h]aicar (20 ␮m). in this case, the intermediate
faicar and the ultimate product, imp, were plotted separately. the time courses of the disappearance of aicar and the
appearance of the intermediate faicar and the product, imp,
are shown in fig. 7. under these reaction conditions we observed a large accumulation of the intermediate faicar,
which was subsequently converted to imp by the end of the
time course. this result strongly suggests that channeling of
faicar from the  xxxg209xxx  site to the impch site does not
occur.
the time course for the formation of imp in this experiment
was very similar to the imp formation in a single turnover of
impch activity. this curve was also biphasic and was best fit
to a double exponential. the first phase had an amplitude of
8.3 ⫾ 2.4 ␮m and a rate of 30 ⫾ 9 s⫺1, and the second phase had
an amplitude of 10.3 ⫾ 2.1 ␮m and a rate of 4.1 ⫾ 1.6 s⫺1.
finding that the rate of impch catalysis is the same in a
single turnover of impch activity and a single turnover of the
bifunctional atic supports a mechanism that does not involve
faicar channeling. it also suggests a lack of any domaindomain communication that would result in rate enhancement
of the impch activity in the bifunctional atic reaction. finally, this result suggests that the rate-limiting step in the
overall bifunctional reaction is the release of thf from the
 xxxg209xxx  active site. pre-steady-state burst experiments indicated that it is likely that the rate-limiting step of the
 xxxg209xxx  reaction (2.9 ⫾ 0.4 s⫺1, which is also limiting in the
overall bifunctional reaction) occurs after the chemical conversion of aicar to faicar. because the rate of imp formation
in a single turnover of the bifunctional reaction is not limited
by the rate-limiting step of the  xxxg209xxx  reaction, it is likely
that the rate-limiting step is at least partially determined by
the release of thf or a conformational change associated with
thf release under the conditions studied here.
kinetic modeling—the individual rate constants, equilibrium constants, and steady-state parameters measured in this
kinetic study are summarized by the mechanism shown in fig.
8. this mechanism was used to construct the kinetic model for
the hatic bifunctional single turnover experiments using
kinsim (fig. 7). we have previously reported that the substrate binding to the  xxxg209xxx  active site follows an ordered

sequential mechanism with 10-ffh4 binding first (27). attempts were made to confirm this by performing substrate
trapping experiments. unfortunately, these experiments were
unsuccessful because of our inability to trap either substrate at
the active site. this suggests that the rate constants for the
binding and dissociation of one or both substrates may be too
fast to be determined by this method. attempts were also made
to directly measure rate constants for substrate binding by
stopped-flow fluorescence; however, no intrinsic protein fluorescence change was observed upon the addition of either substrate. nevertheless, based on our previous results, a justification was provided for a model in which 10-ffh4 binds first.
to account for the biphasic behavior in the time course of
imp formation in the single turnover experiments, it was necessary to include two populations of impch active sites. this
was accomplished by including a ligand bound in 50% of the
sites. it was assumed that a ligand bound in the impch active
sites would not affect the  xxxg209xxx  activity in a single turnover. the rate of dissociation of the prebound ligand was taken
as 2.3 s⫺1, which was the rate of the slower phase of the
biphasic impch curve from the single turnover experiments.
the release of thf was taken as a rate-limiting step in the
bifunctional reaction, i.e. 2.9 s⫺1. there was no need to invoke
a channeling step or any rate enhancement due to domaindomain communication to explain any of the kinetic data obtained in this study.
discussion

the application of rapid chemical quench and stopped-flow
absorbance to the study of bifunctional human atic has allowed a direct analysis of the kinetics for the conversion of
aicar to imp. this study has provided definitive evidence
that the channeling of faicar from the  xxxg209xxx  active site
to the impch active site does not occur. this evidence consists
of a few key points. first, the large accumulation of faicar in
a single turnover of the bifunctional reaction suggests that
faicar dissociates from the  xxxg209xxx  site and rebinds at the
impch site. in cases wherein channeling has been proven (11,
12), the channeling step is very fast (⬎1000 s⫺1), and there is
very little or no detectable amount of the intermediate product
observed in a single turnover.
a second important result was that the rate of formation of

the hatic enzyme (40 ␮m) was mixed with [3h]faicar (20 ␮m). the
formation of [3h]imp (●) was monitored by tlc as described under
“experimental procedures”. the data were fit to a double exponential to

we have also ruled out the possibility of domain-domain
communication by the finding that there does not appear to be
any rate enhancement of the impch activity in a single turnover of the bifunctional atic reaction. occupation of the
impch site by a specific inhibitor was previously shown not to
have an effect on  xxxg209xxx  activity (20), which gives further
support to this conclusion.
these conclusions lead to the consideration of other potential
functional advantages to the conserved bifunctionality of atic.
as we have again shown here, it has been previously reported
(20) that the  xxxg209xxx  activity favors the reverse reaction in
the steady-state (2.9 s⫺1 forward versus 6.7 s⫺1 reverse). the
impch reaction, however, highly favors the forward direction.
perhaps the advantage of linking the two activities is to draw
the equilibrium of the  xxxg209xxx  reaction toward the formation
of faicar by subsequently converting the faicar to imp.
having the two enzyme activities linked guarantees a stoichiometric amount of the impch active sites available to convert
any faicar formed to imp. one could argue that the close
proximity (⬃50 å apart) (28) of the two active sites provides an
increased local concentration of impch active sites. szabados
and christopherson (19) have performed theoretical calculations that suggested that the local concentration of faicar at
the impch active sites was higher than the faicar in bulk
solution (added exogenously), based on the results of their
steady-state experiments.
another possible advantage to the bifunctionality of atic is
more structural in nature. we have recently shown that in
solution hatic exists in a monomer/dimer equilibrium with a
dissociation constant of 240 nm at 4 °c and that the dimeric
form is required for  xxxg209xxx  activity (21). the crystal structure of avian atic has been described as an “extensively intertwined” homodimer with a considerable dimer interface for
a protein of its size burying 4929 å2 per monomer, of which the
impch domain makes up 38% (28). with such a large percentage of the dimer interface from the impch domain, it is possible that the physical linking of these two activities on the
same polypeptide helps to keep the protein in the dimeric form
required for  xxxg209xxx  activity. to test the possibility that
there is a kinetic or structural advantage to having  xxxg209xxx 
and impch activities physically linked, we plan to perform
reconstitution experiments with the  xxxg209xxx  and impch
truncation mutants that we have described previously (1).
in conclusion, we have provided definitive kinetic evidence
that substrate channeling does not occur with bifunctional
human atic. we have also provided a detailed kinetic analysis
of this enzyme, which can provide a basis for studies of catalytic
mechanism as well as aid in the design characterization of
potential inhibitors of these important enzyme activities.

imp was the same in the bifunctional reaction (40 ⫾ 6 s⫺1) as
it was in the single turnover of impch activity when faicar
came from the bulk solution (30 ⫾ 9 s⫺1). in addition to lending
further evidence against a substrate channeling hypothesis,
this also suggests a lack of any domain-domain communication
that would cause rate enhancement of the second activity as
has been shown to occur in some proven examples of substrate
channeling.
interestingly, the time course for the formation of imp in a
single turnover of impch activity was found to be biphasic and
was best fit to a double exponential. this was also the case for
the imp formation in a single turnover of the bifunctional
reaction. it seems likely that the faster phase is the actual rate
of impch catalysis. there are at least two possible explanations for the observation of a second, slower phase. one possibility is that there are two populations of impch active sites
with different conformations. in this case, the faster phase
would be due to catalysis by the population of sites in an active
conformation. the slower phase could represent catalysis by a
population in a less active conformation or the rate of the
conformational change from an inactive to an active conformation. a second possibility is that human atic contains a ligand
bound in a fraction of the impch active sites. if this is the case,
the faster phase of the biphasic curve would represent impch
catalysis by the unoccupied fraction of active sites, and the
slower phase would represent the rate of dissociation for the
bound ligand.
recent crystallographic data by wilson and co-workers at
the scripps research institute (28) suggest that the later possibility is likely to be the case. avian atic was found to
crystallize as a dimer with a purine nucleotide-like density in
one of the two impch active sites. it was concluded that the
ligand must have been acquired during the expression of the
enzyme in e. coli because no nucleotides were added during the
purification or crystallization procedures. the human atic
used in our experiments was purified by the same method as
the avian atic. experiments are underway to determine the
identity of the ligand in the avian structure as well as to
investigate whether this is the cause of the biphasic impch
activity observed in single turnover experiments with human
atic.
the kinetic mechanism shown in fig. 8 summarizes the
individual rate and equilibrium constants that were obtained
by this study and used as constraints in the modeling performed with kinsim. when kinsim was used to construct the
models, there was no need to include any steps for channeling
or for rate enhancement to explain any of the data obtained in
this study. thus, we conclude that there is no kinetic evidence
to support a substrate channeling hypothesis for hatic. this is
consistent with structural studies that show no evidence of a
tunnel or cavity connecting the two active sites to form a
channel (28). in fact, any potential pathway between the
 xxxg209xxx  and impch sites is apparently precluded by the
presence of two overlapping ␤-loops that lie between the two
domains.
