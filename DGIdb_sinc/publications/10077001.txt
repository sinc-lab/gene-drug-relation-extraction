natural and pharmacological  xxxg183xxx 
(ar) ligands were tested for their ability to induce
the ar nh2-terminal and carboxyl-terminal (n/c)
interaction in a two-hybrid protein assay to determine whether n/c complex formation distinguishes in vivo ar agonists from antagonists.
high-affinity agonists such as dihydrotestosterone, mibolerone, testosterone, and methyltrienolone at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 nm induce the n/c interaction more than 40-fold. the
lower affinity anabolic steroids,  xxxd2806xxx  and
 xxxd2136xxx , require concentrations of 10–100
nm for up to 23-fold induction of the n/c interaction. however no n/c interaction was detected in
the presence of the antagonists, hydroxyflutamide,
 xxxd1786xxx , or ru56187, at concentrations up to 1 mm, or with 1 mm estradiol, progesterone, or  xxxd2554xxx ; each of
these steroids at 1–500 nm inhibited the dihydrotestosterone-induced n/c interaction, with  xxxd2554xxx  being the most effective. in
transient and stable cotransfection assays using
the mouse mammary tumor virus reporter vector,
all ligands displayed concentration-dependent ar
agonist activity that paralleled induction of the n/c
interaction, with antagonists and weaker agonists
failing to induce the n/c interaction. ar dimerization and dna binding in mobility shift assays and
ar stabilization reflected, but were not dependent
on, the n/c interaction. the results indicate that

the n/c interaction facilitates agonist potency at
low physiological ligand concentrations as detected in transcription, dimerization/dna binding,
and stabilization assays. however the n/c interaction is not required for agonist activity at sufficiently high ligand concentrations, nor does its inhibition imply antagonist activity. (molecular
endocrinology 13: 440–454, 1999)

introduction
 xxxg183xxx  (ar) function is required for male
sex development in the fetus, virilization at puberty,
and maintenance of reproductive function in the adult.
interruption of these processes by pharmacological
androgen antagonists or environmental endocrine disruptors can cause incomplete masculinization of the
fetus or possibly reduced male fertility later in life (1, 2).
overstimulation of the prostate by androgen agonists
may promote prostate cancer (3). experimental approaches to identify and distinguish ar agonists from
antagonists would aid in the classification of environmental and pharmaceutical chemicals since ligandbinding affinity alone does not necessarily reflect biological potency, and transient transcriptional assays
can be hampered by the complexity of the systems.
previous studies from this laboratory identified an
ar nh2-terminal and carboxyl-terminal (n/c) interaction that requires high-affinity androgen binding (4).
the androgen-induced n/c interaction is inhibited by
the androgen antagonist hydroxyflutamide. these results raised the possibility that an n/c interaction is

prostate extracts, or the concentration required for
50% inhibition of [3h]methyltrienolone ( xxxd2631xxx ) binding
to recombinant ar in transfected cos cells (table 1).
relative competitive binding affinities for [3h] xxxd2631xxx  in
transfected cos cells were mibolerone ;  xxxd2631xxx  .
ru56187 . dihydrotestosterone (dht) ; mpa ; progesterone . estradiol (e2) .  xxxd1786xxx  .
testosterone ;  xxxd2806xxx  ;  xxxd2136xxx  . hydroxyflutamide. chemical structures of several of the
ligands are shown in fig. 1. binding of dht and testosterone was weaker in the cos cell assay when
compared with apparent equilibrium binding affinities
in tissue cytosols (table 1) likely resulting from partial
metabolism during the 2-h 37 c incubation. analysis of
cos cells transfected with the parent plasmid lacking
the ar sequence showed binding only of [3h]progesterone. lack of binding of [3h] xxxd2631xxx  and [3h]mibolerone in the absence of ar expression suggested that
this endogenous binding activity was not due to the
 xxxg1737xxx  (7–10). inhibition constants for
the anabolic steroids  xxxd2806xxx  (ki 62 nm) and  xxxd2136xxx  (ki 44 nm) were less than that of hydroxyflutamide (ki 175 nm), but about 100 times
greater than the equilibrium binding constant (kd) for
high affinity agonists such as dht. competitive binding by mpa and ru56187 were similar to dht, although the reported kd values for mpa were slightly
greater than that for dht (table 1).

required for ar agonist activity and that its interruption
is a prerequisite for antagonist activity. similar studies
with the  xxxg730xxx  revealed a ligand-dependent n/c interaction that predicted parallel dimerization (5). recent studies on ar suggest that its n/c
interaction is intermolecular and results in the formation of an antiparallel homodimer (6). a feature common to both models is the requirement for high-affinity
agonist binding to promote the n/c interaction. in the
present report we tested the requirement for the ar
n/c interaction in relation to ar dimerization, dna
binding, and transcriptional activity in transient and
stable cotransfection assays to distinguish the activities of several natural and pharmaceutical agonists
and antagonists. the results suggest that at higher
concentrations, certain weak ar agonists such as  xxxd2554xxx  (mpa) activate ar through
a mechanism that does not involve the n/c interaction, although potent agonists capable of ar activation at low ligand concentrations induce the n/c
interaction. furthermore, inhibition of the n/c interaction
does not necessarily reflect the activity of an antagonist.

(4, 6). relative ligand potency between 0.1 nm and 1
mm was dht ; mibolerone . testosterone ;
 xxxd2631xxx  .  xxxd2806xxx  .  xxxd2136xxx  (fig. 2).
no n/c interaction was detected with mpa,
ru56187, e2, progesterone, hydroxyflutamide, or
 xxxd1786xxx  up to concentrations of 1 mm.
induction of the n/c interaction did not correlate
with relative binding affinities (fig. 2 and table 1).
the relatively high-affinity ligands, mpa and
ru56187, failed to promote the n/c interaction,
whereas the lower affinity anabolic steroids,  xxxd2806xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx , induced the n/c interaction. the inability of mpa to induce the n/c
interaction was not limited to cho cells, as it was
also ineffective in monkey kidney cv1 or cos cells
where 5-fold induction of the n/c interaction was
observed with 1 nm dht (data not shown).
inhibition of the dht-induced n/c interaction by
hydroxyflutamide reported previously (4) raised the

possibility that this inhibition may be necessary for and
indicative of androgen antagonist activity. because
mpa is a weak ar agonist in vivo (11–13), it was
surprising that mpa at concentrations as low as 10 nm
blocked the dht-induced n/c interaction and was
about 50 times more potent than hydroxyflutamide as
an inhibitor (fig. 3 and table 1). ru56187 was a
slightly less potent inhibitor of the n/c interaction than
mpa, exhibited a high ar equilibrium binding affinity,
and is reported to have antagonist activity in vivo (14,
15). ligands with less inhibitory activity than mpa or
ru56187 at concentrations between 50 and 500 nm
were hydroxyflutamide,  xxxd1786xxx , e2, and
progesterone (fig. 3 and table 1). the anabolic steroids,  xxxd2806xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx , and the potent androgen agonists, dht, mibolerone, testosterone, and  xxxd2631xxx , showed little or no inhibition of the
dht-induced n/c interaction.

ar n/c interaction and agonist activity

fig. 2. ligand dependence of the ar n/c interaction determined in a two-hybrid protein assay in cho cells
cho cells were transfected with gald-h and vpar1–660 human ar fusion protein expression vectors and the g5e1bluciferase reporter vector as described in materials and methods. cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of dht,
t (0.1–100 nm), methyltrienolone ( xxxd2631xxx ), mibolerone (mib) (0.1–10 nm),  xxxd2806xxx  (oxand),  xxxd2136xxx  (fluoxy)
(0.1–100 nm), mpa, ru56187, e2, progesterone (prog), hydroxyflutamide (oh-fl), and  xxxd1786xxx  (ca) (0.1–1000 nm)
as indicated. shown are the optical luciferase units, and above the bars, the fold induction relative to the activity determined in
the absence of ligand. the data are representative of at least three independent experiments.

tion, we tested gald-h with vpd-h in the two-hybrid
assay. vpd-h contains the vp16 transactivation domain linked as a fusion protein to the ar hinge and
steroid-binding domain amino acid residues 624–919
and was used previously to demonstrate lack of a c/c
interaction induced by dht (4). neither mpa nor dht
induced a c/c interaction in this assay more than
2-fold (results not shown).
transcriptional activation
agonist and antagonist activities were determined in
cv1 cells transiently transfected with a mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv)-luciferase reporter and fulllength human ar expression vectors. ligands with
more than 10-fold agonist activity at 0.001 nm were
dht, mibolerone, and  xxxd2631xxx  (fig. 4 and table 1).
similar induction was achieved by 0.01 nm testosterone, 0.1 nm mpa, and 1 nm  xxxd2806xxx  or  xxxd2136xxx .  xxxd1786xxx , progesterone, e2, and

ru56187 induced luciferase activity at concentrations
between 10 and 100 nm, but transcriptional activity
remained low at 100 nm hydroxyflutamide, the latter
requiring concentrations of 1–10 mm for agonist activity
in this assay (16). agonist potency, therefore, tended
to parallel the ligand-induced n/c interaction. lack of
an n/c interaction induced by mpa is associated with
100-fold higher mpa concentrations necessary for
transcriptional activity compared with dht.
when transcriptional activity was tested in the same
cells (cho cells) used for the n/c two-hybrid assay
but using the mmtv-luciferase reporter, 10- to 100fold higher mpa concentrations were also required
relative to dht. in cv1 cells transfected with the
mmtv-luciferase reporter and the pcmv5 parent plasmid lacking ar sequence, there was no induction of
luciferase activity by mpa or any other ligand tested,
ruling out the possibility that mpa activity was mediated through an endogenous receptor or altered lucif-

cho cells were transfected with the ar fusion expression vectors and the g5e1b-luciferase reporter vector as described in
materials and methods and incubated with and without 1 nm dht or in the presence of 1 nm dht with increasing concentrations
of the indicated ligands (abbreviations as in fig. 2 legend). optical luciferase units are shown with the fold induction relative to

erase expression by a nonreceptor mechanism. a luciferase reporter vector with two copies of the mmtv
glucocorticoid response element separated by a
29-bp linker derived from pmtv29vtm (17) and
cloned into pt81luc (18) also had greater agonist
activity with dht relative to mpa (data not shown).
antagonist activity of the ligands was tested in cv1
cells by coincubation with 0.1 nm dht. hydroxyflutamide was the most effective antagonist with about
50% inhibition at 100 nm (fig. 5).  xxxd1786xxx 
was slightly less effective, and ru56187 had some
inhibitory activity but decreased in effectiveness at
higher concentrations. antagonist activity was also
observed with increasing concentrations of progesterone and e2, but none was observed with mpa (fig. 5)
or with the high-affinity agonists or the anabolic steroids (results not shown). thus, except for mpa, at
least partial inhibition of dht-induced transcriptional
activity correlated with inhibition of the dht-induced
n/c interaction.

the inability of mpa to induce the n/c interaction
but have agonist rather than antagonist activity in transient transcription assays and in vivo (11–13, 19)
prompted us to investigate whether two ar mutants
that cause severe androgen insensitivity might be selectively activated by mpa in transient cotransfection
assays. the mutants, v889m and r752q, each retain
high-affinity equilibrium binding of [3h] xxxd2631xxx  (20–22)
but are defective in the n/c interaction (6). v889m had
a similar blunted response to both dht and mpa in the
mmtv-luciferase reporter assay in cv1 cells, whereas
r752q required about 10-fold higher concentrations
of mpa (10 nm) relative to dht to induce transcription
(data not shown). thus, neither mutant defective in the
n/c interaction was efficiently activated by mpa or
dht, suggesting that these regions of the ligandbinding domain are important in ar activation by
both steroids.
the weak in vivo ar agonist activity reported for
mpa (11–13, 19) is reflected in mmtv-luciferase as-

ar n/c interaction and agonist activity

fig. 4. ligand-dependent ar-mediated transcriptional activation of the mmtv-luciferase reporter vector in cv1 cells
cv1 cells were transfected with 0.1 mg pcmvhar full-length human ar expression vector and 5 mg mmtv-luciferase reporter
vector using calcium phosphate as described in materials and methods. transfected cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of the indicated ligands (abbreviations as in fig. 2 legend). shown is the fold induction of luciferase activity relative

says by the requirement for higher mpa concentrations relative to dht for reporter gene activation. nevertheless, the agonist activity of mpa was surprising
considering that mpa inhibits the n/c interaction better than most antagonists. we therefore tested a cho
cell line in which the mmtv-luciferase reporter and
human ar expression vectors were stably integrated
in the genome using pcdna3.1/zeo vector with the
zeocin gene and the human ar-coding sequence (k.
bobseine and w. r. kelce, unpublished data). cell
lines such as this were used previously to distinguish
agonist activities not detected by transient transfection (24). dht at 0.1 nm stimulated luciferase activity
2-fold while mpa required a 10-fold higher concentration for similar induction (data not shown). a greater
overall response to mpa (10-fold) compared with dht
(6-fold) likely resulted from mpa activation of endogenous  xxxg1601xxx  since coincubation with
500 nm hydroxyflutamide inhibited mpa-activated
gene transcription about 50% and dht activity by
95%, but had no effect on induction by dexamethasone (data not shown). the ar-mediated mpa re-

sponse was therefore similar to that of dht, but
required higher steroid concentrations as observed
in the transient assays. the chromatin arrangement
of the reporter gene seemed to have little effect on
the relative concentration-dependent gene activation by dht and mpa.
dimerization and dna binding
because binding of baculovirus expressed full-length
ar to androgen response element dna requires exposure of sf9 cells to androgen and is inhibited by
coincubation with the antagonist hydroxyflutamide
(25), we tested the activity of these ligands to promote
ar dna binding in vitro. dna binding of full-length ar
was observed with 50 nm dht, mibolerone, mpa,  xxxd2806xxx ,  xxxd2136xxx  (fig. 6a), or 50 nm  xxxd2631xxx 
or testosterone (fig. 6b). concentrations of dht or
 xxxd2631xxx  less than 50 nm reduced ar dna binding probably due to insufficient saturation of baculovirusexpressed ar (data not shown). ar dna binding was

fig. 5. ar antagonist activity in cv1 cells
cv1 cells were transfected with 0.1 mg pcmvhar and 5 mg mmtv-luciferase reporter vector as described in materials and
methods and incubated in the presence and absence of 0.1 nm dht or in the presence of 0.1 nm dht with increasing

observed at 1 mm ru56187 or hydroxyflutamide but
was barely detectable with 1 mm progesterone, e2, or
 xxxd1786xxx  (fig. 6).
dimerization and dna binding of baculovirus-expressed ar nh2- and carboxyl-terminal fragments
that contain the dna-binding domain were also shown
previously to distinguish androgen agonists and antagonists (25). while the nh2-terminal and dna-binding domain fragment ar1–660 (not shown) and the
dna- binding and carboxyl-terminal fragment ar507–
919 (fig. 7, lanes c) each homodimerize and bind dna
independently of hormone, agonists are required for
dimerization and dna binding of the n/c complex and
an antagonist such as hydroxyflutamide inhibits this
dht-induced dna binding (25, 26). since both fragments contain the dna-binding domain, dimerization
could be mediated by the dna-binding domain and/or
by the n/c interaction. results of this assay (25) and
others (22) nevertheless predicted the ar n/c interaction, which was later confirmed in the two-hybrid
interaction assay (4).

dimerization and dna binding of the ar fragments
were observed at 50 nm dht, mibolerone, testosterone, and  xxxd2631xxx  (fig. 7a, c1n) but required 0.5–1 mm
 xxxd2806xxx  or  xxxd2136xxx  for similar activity.
mpa-induced dimerization and dna binding of the
two ar fragments were somewhat less efficient than
dht but similar to the anabolic steroids (fig. 7, a and
b). only slightly weaker dna binding of the n/c hybrids was detected using  xxxd1786xxx  and e2,
whereas 1 mm ru56187 or 1 mm progesterone was
required for dna binding, and essentially no dna
binding was detected with 1 mm hydroxyflutamide (fig.
7 and table 2). binding of the homodimer c fragment
alone was most effective with mibolerone, testosterone, and  xxxd2631xxx ; it was not detected with 50 nm dht,
required 500 nm mpa, and was weak to undetectable
with the anabolic steroids and other ligands (fig. 7,

sf9 cells expressing human ar were incubated with increasing concentrations of ligands as described in materials

materials and methods. shown is a reproduction of films in
which the free 32p-labeled oligo bands were removed from

untreated with recombinant virus or ligand. the ar-32p-oligo

extent of ar dimerization and dna binding (data not
shown).
thus, mpa,  xxxd1786xxx , e2, and progesterone at concentrations between 50 nm and 1 mm induce
dimerization and dna binding of the nh2- and
carboxyl-terminal ar fragments, where both fragments contain the ar dna-binding domain (fig. 7b).
yet none of these ligands, except for mpa, promote
dna binding of full-length ar and none induce the
n/c two-hybrid interaction (fig. 7a). the effectiveness
of these ligands to induce dimerization and dna binding of the ar nh2- and carboxyl-terminal fragments in
mobility shift assays is confounded by the presence of
the dimerization region in the dna-binding domain.
we therefore attempted to address the contribution of
the ar dna-binding domain in the two-hybrid assay

by testing the interaction of a fusion protein comprised
of the gal4 dna-binding domain and ar dna and
ligand-binding domains (gal-ar507–919) with
vpar1–660 or vpar. however, lack of an interaction
in this and additional experiments using gal-ar
(gal4 dna-binding domain-full-length ar fusion protein) suggests that the presence of two dna-binding
domains in a fusion protein (i.e. from gal4 and ar)
interferes with hybrid formation.

agonists. it is noteworthy that the lower affinity anabolic
steroids,  xxxd2806xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx , promote
the n/c interaction and stabilize ar at concentrations of
5–10 nm, concentrations only slightly higher than those
required for the high-affinity agonists, dht, mibolerone,
 xxxd2631xxx , and testosterone. however, higher concentrations of the anabolic steroids were required for dna
binding of the ar fragments, perhaps reflecting the lower
ar binding affinity for these ligands.

ar stabilization

ligand dissociation rates

one property that has distinguished androgen agonists from antagonists is their ability to stabilize ar
against degradation (27). it was therefore of interest to
determine the concentration dependence of ar stabilization by mpa, ru56187, and the anabolic steroids.
transfected cos cells were incubated with [35s]
methionine/cysteine and increasing concentrations of
ligands, followed by chase periods with unlabeled
methionine for 2–7 h as previously described (27). the
results shown for several ligands in fig. 8 and summarized in table 2 indicate that more than 100 nm mpa
was required to increase the ar degradation half-time
to almost 5 h at 37 c (fig. 8c). a similar degree of ar
stabilization was achieved by 1 nm dht, mibolerone,
or  xxxd2631xxx , 5 nm testosterone (table 2), or 10 nm  xxxd2136xxx  or  xxxd2806xxx  (fig. 8, b and d).  xxxd1786xxx  and progesterone stabilized ar only at
1 mm (table 2), and almost no ar stabilization was
observed with 1 mm ru56187 (fig. 8a), hydroxyflutamide, or e2 (table 2). the results tend to parallel the
mmtv-luciferase and dna-binding activities in that
ligands that efficiently stabilize ar are more effective

because only few ligands could be obtained in 3hlabeled form, dissociation rates could not be determined for mpa,  xxxd2806xxx ,  xxxd2136xxx ,  xxxd1786xxx , or hydroxyflutamide. nevertheless, we
determined that [3h]ru56187 dissociates rapidly from
ar with a t1/2 of 5 min at 37 c (fig. 9) compared with
t1/2 of 2.5–3.5 h for [3h] xxxd2631xxx  (fig. 9), [3h]dht, and
[3h]mibolerone (table 2). a rapid dissociation rate for
[3h]estradiol (t1/2 0.67 h) (table 2) was also observed.
the results raise the possibility that rapid ligand dissociation is associated with the lack of an n/c interaction and with in vivo antagonist activity.

discussion
failure of mpa to induce the n/c interaction suggests
that during ar dimerization, dna binding, and gene
activation, mpa activates ar by a mechanism different from other agonists. with the other ligands tested,
agonist activity correlated with induction of the n/c

interaction and antagonist activity with its inhibition.
mpa is a weak androgen in vivo (see below) which
perhaps relates to its inability to induce the n/c interaction. induction of the n/c interaction by high-affinity
ar agonists appears to contribute to their biological
potency at low physiological concentrations. lack of
induction of the n/c interaction may account for the
high mpa concentrations required to stabilize ar,
which would contribute to a reduced biological potency as an androgen agonist.

the apparent discrepancy in ligand potency between maximal induction in the n/c assay using the
gal4-ar carboxyl-terminal and the vp16-ar nh2fragment fusion proteins (0.1–1 nm) vs. agonist potency of full-length ar in the luciferase assay (0.001–
0.01 nm) probably reflects deletion of the nh2-terminal
domain. we demonstrated previously that although
the ar ligand-binding domain retains high-affinity
binding after deletion of the nh2-terminal region, the
ligand dissociation rate increases 5- to 7-fold, and

androgen no longer stabilizes this truncated receptor
as it does full-length ar (22). thus, higher ligand concentrations are likely required for the n/c interaction
between ar fragments than between monomers of
full-length ar.
equilibrium dissociation constants (mpa, 1.7–2.9
nm; dht, 0.9–2.6 nm) and saturation binding capacities
(mpa, 107–249 fmol/mg protein; dht, 42–257
fmol/mg protein) for mpa and dht binding to ar were
similar when measured in rat pituitary and hypothalamic extracts (28). however, direct measurement of in
vivo bioactivity classifies mpa as a weak androgen.
mpa increases the synthesis of b-glucuronidase in
mouse kidney but only at 100-fold higher doses relative to testosterone (11, 12). in the androgen- insensitive tfm mouse, b-glucuronidase activity did not increase, indicating that gene activation in response to
mpa is ar mediated (12). mpa doses up to 1000 times
higher than testosterone were required to increase
ventral prostate weight in castrated rats (13). highdose (0.9 mg/day) mpa was less effective than lowdose dht (0.2 mg/day) in stimulating the synthesis of
rat  xxxg1723xxx  mrna, and the effects of
mpa were inhibited by  xxxd2143xxx  (19), again indicating
that its in vivo activity is ar mediated. mpa, rather
than a metabolite, was shown to bind ar, and its low

vol 13 no. 3

in vivo androgenic activity correlated with reduced
nuclear uptake (29, 30). mpa was reported to dissociate rapidly from ar (13, 31), although these studies
did not account for possible degradation of the
mpa-ar complex. x-ray crystal analysis indicates that
mpa has an inverted 1b,2a half-chair conformation of
the a-ring resulting from steric strain by the 6a-methyl
group that restricts side chain flexibility (32). this predicted rigid structure of mpa is in contrast to the flat,
flexible structure of methyltrienolone ( xxxd2631xxx ), which
can undergo large shape changes (33). it is conceivable that ligand flexibility facilitates the conformational
changes required for the ar n/c interaction.
acetate derivatives of steroids often have slower
metabolic breakdown rates, making them candidates
for use in hormone therapy (34). mpa, available for
clinical use as provera or  xxxd2554xxx , has been
used in the treatment of sexual precocity; its progestin
and weak androgen effects inhibit pituitary gonadotropin secretion and lower gonadal steroid production
(35). stimulation of the growth of pubic hair in female
patients without a significant slowdown in skeletal
maturation (35) suggested weak androgenic activity of
large doses of mpa (200–300 mg every 7–10 days).
21-hydroxylated metabolites of mpa bind the  xxxg1601xxx  and suppress pituitary secretion
of acth. because of its progestational effect, mpa
was formerly used to prevent spontaneous abortion.
however, prenatal exposure to mpa was reported to
cause mild clitoral hypertrophy and posterior labial
fusion in the female and hypospadias in the male
(36–39), contraindicating its use during pregnancy.
the virilizing effect of mpa in the female fetus can be
explained by its androgenic activity. antiandrogen effects of mpa in the male fetus could result from competition for dht binding to ar and subsequent insufficient agonist activity. anogenital distance, a measure
of antiandrogen activity in rodents (1), was lengthened
in females and shortened in males exposed to mpa
during fetal development. more recently, mpa was
approved for use in the united states as an injectable
contraceptive based on its effectiveness in suppressing gonadotropin secretion, inhibiting follicular maturation and preventing ovulation. doses of 150 mg im
every 6 weeks to 3 months lack androgen effects in the
adult female.
mpa has also been used in breast cancer therapy
(40, 41). in an mfm-223 mammary cancer cell line that
has high levels of ar, but low levels of estrogen,
progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors, cell proliferation was inhibited by 1 nm dht or 10 nm mpa (42),
indicating the ar agonist effect of mpa inhibits breast
cancer cell growth. response rates of breast cancer
patients to mpa therapy correlated with higher ar
levels (43). the antiproliferative activity of dht and
mpa on breast cancer cells was attributed to increased 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity,
which promotes increased oxidation of estradiol to the
weak estrogen, estrone (44).

ar n/c interaction and agonist activity

agonists vs. antagonist activity is influenced by metabolism, binding affinity, association and dissociation
rates, and ligand-induced receptor conformation, stabilization, dimerization, dna binding, and interactions
with associating proteins. clearly, equilibrium binding
affinity is of limited usefulness in predicting in vivo
bioactivity unless combined with measurements of ligand dissociation rates. ar binding affinity of
ru56187 is similar to that for dht, yet ru56187 is an
antagonist in vivo (14, 15). the anabolic steroids,  xxxd2806xxx  and  xxxd2136xxx , have high inhibition
constants for binding, yet induce the n/c interaction
and stabilize ar at relatively low ligand concentrations
and are ar agonists in vivo.  xxxd2806xxx  induces
male- specific liver p450 enzymes (45).  xxxd2806xxx 
and  xxxd2136xxx  are structurally related 17a-alkylated synthetic anabolic steroids used clinically to promote weight gain, stimulate growth of the bone matrix,
and improve libido and sexual performance (46). in low
doses  xxxd2806xxx  (47, 48) or  xxxd2136xxx  (49)
accelerate linear growth in children with constitutional
growth delay and turner’s syndrome (50, 51).
evidence from crystal structure analysis of the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor-g (52), thyroid  xxxg1603xxx 
(53), and  xxxg730xxx  (54) indicates that hormone binding causes helix 12 [helix 11 in retinoid x
receptor-a (55)] at the carboxyl terminus to undergo a
conformational change closing down over the ligandbinding pocket. for the  xxxg730xxx , binding of
the antagonist raloxifene prevents alignment of helix
12 over the binding pocket (54). mpa binding to ar
may distort the position of helix 12 causing an increased rate of ligand dissociation and interference
with the n/c interaction. proper closure of helix 12
might be expected to slow ligand dissociation from the
pocket and form a new interface for the n/c interaction. alignment of helix 12 by mpa binding may differ
from that induced by potent agonists or antagonists, a
distortion that may account for the high mpa concentrations required to stabilize ar.
part of the discrepancy between ligand binding affinity and agonist and antagonist activities relates to
differences in ligand binding kinetics. association and
dissociation rate kinetics can be fast or slow for highaffinity ligands. slow dissociation of the most potent
ar agonists, dht, mibolerone, and  xxxd2631xxx , is associated with ar stabilization at low ligand concentration.
fast dissociating ligands such as ru56187 fail to stabilize ar and have agonist activity in transcriptional
activation assays but are antagonists in vivo. mutations in the ar hormone-binding domain at valine 889
and arginine 752 cause severe androgen insensitivity,
increase the rate of dissociation of bound androgen
without altering high-affinity equilibrium binding (22),
disrupt the n/c interaction (6), and cause loss of ar
stabilization by low ligand concentrations (22). these
mutations likely increase the rate of ligand dissociation
and ar degradation by preventing helix 12 from closing the binding pocket and interfering with the n/c
interaction. rapid ligand dissociation could reduce in

451

vivo agonist activity and enhance dose-dependent antagonist activity as suggested previously for some antiestrogens and antiandrogens (13).
the most reliable in vitro indicators of in vivo ar
antagonist activity therefore appear to be failure of a
ligand to stabilize ar against degradation at steroid
concentrations of 500 nm or more and an inability to
induce ar dna binding. dna binding itself, however,
appears to be a poor indicator of agonist potency. in
vivo agonist activity is best reflected by a slow dissociation rate of bound ligand, ar stabilization at low
ligand concentrations (# 10 nm), and induction of the
n/c interaction. concentrations at which a ligand activates ar in mmtv-luciferase assays can indicate
agonist potency. mpa is an agonist in transient transcription assays but requires 100-fold higher concentrations than dht. a similar shift in in vitro sensitivity to
dht results from certain ar missense mutations that
cause partial or complete androgen insensitivity (56),
indicating the critical importance of ar activation by
low ligand concentrations. however, even though acetate derivatives of steroids have increased metabolic
half-lives, it cannot be ruled out that the in vivo pharmacology of mpa limits its bioavailability to the ar.
a model for androgen-induced ar dimerization suggests an antiparallel orientation of monomers interacting through the dna-binding domain and a liganddependent n/c interaction (4). similar studies with the
 xxxg730xxx  (5) and ar fragments expressed in
yeast (57) predict a parallel interaction model, and
studies on solution dimerization of the human  xxxg1737xxx  favor a parallel model (58). more recent studies on ar made use of androgen insensitivity
mutations in the steroid-binding domain that do not
interfere with high-affinity equilibrium binding of androgen but increased the dissociation rate of bound
androgen and disrupted the n/c interaction. placement of the mutations in different ar fragments allowed assessment of directional dimerization in association with ar transcriptional activation, and the
results were consistent with an antiparallel activated
ar dimer model (6). lack of an interaction between the
ligand-binding domains bound to mpa or dht argue
against a parallel dimer model for ar with either ligand. taken together the results suggest that the n/c
interaction is required for potent in vivo agonists to be
effective at low concentrations, but is not required for
ar dna binding in vitro or weak in vivo agonist activity
at higher ligand concentrations. formation of the n/c
interaction likely contributes to in vivo potency by stabilizing ar at low ligand concentrations.
