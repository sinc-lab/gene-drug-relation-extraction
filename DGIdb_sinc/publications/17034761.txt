abstract
toll-like receptors (tlrs), which are activated by invading microorganisms or endogenous molecules, evoke immune and inﬂammatory responses. tlr activation is closely linked to the development of many chronic inﬂammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. auranoﬁn, an au(i) compound, is a well-known and long-used anti-rheumatic drug. however, the mechanism as to how auranoﬁn
relieves the symptom of rheumatoid arthritis has not been fully clariﬁed. our results demonstrated that auranoﬁn suppressed tlr4-mediated activation of transcription factors, nf-jb and irf3, and expression of cox-2, a pro-inﬂammatory enzyme. this suppression was
well correlated with the inhibitory eﬀect of auranoﬁn on the homodimerization of tlr4 induced by an agonist. furthermore, auranoﬁn
inhibited nf-jb activation induced by  xxxg1489xxx -dependent downstream signaling components of tlr4,  xxxg1489xxx ,  xxxg1159xxx , and p65. irf3
activation induced by  xxxg1489xxx -independent signaling components, trif and tbk1, was also downregulated by auranoﬁn. our results
ﬁrst demonstrate that auranoﬁn suppresses the multiple steps in tlr4 signaling, especially the homodimerization of tlr4. the results
suggest that the suppression of tlr4 activity by auranoﬁn may be the molecular mechanism through which auranoﬁn exerts anti-rheumatic activity.

toll-like receptors (tlrs) play an important role in
innate immune responses that are essential for host defense
against invading microbial pathogens [1–4]. tlrs interact
with diﬀerent combinations of adapter proteins. tlr signaling pathways can trigger the activation of nf-jb
through the  xxxg1489xxx -dependent pathway, but they also
induce type i ifn expression through the  xxxg1489xxx -depenq

dent and -independent pathways.  xxxg1489xxx  is the immediate
adapter molecule which is common to all mammalian
tlrs [1].  xxxg1489xxx  recruits il-1 receptor-associated
kinase-4 ( xxxg1195xxx ) and induces phosphorylation of
 xxxg1195xxx  leading to the phosphorylation of irak-1. the
phosphorylated irak-1 associates with tumor necrosis
factor (tnf) receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6) leading
to the activation of the canonical ikk complex resulting in
the activation of nf-jb transcription factor. the activation of nf-jb leads to the induction of inﬂammatory gene
products such as cytokines and  xxxg1884xxx  [5].
 xxxg2289xxx  and tlr4 activate  xxxg1489xxx -independent signaling pathway mediated through tir domain-containing
adapter inducing  xxxg1140xxx  (trif). trif-dependent pathway
triggers the expression of type i ifn mediated through
tbk1 and ikke [6,7]. the c-terminal portion of trif
was also shown to be associated with rip1 leading to the

h.s. youn et al. / biochemical and biophysical research communications 350 (2006) 866–871

delayed activation of nf-jb [8]. thus, trif is likely to
use tbk1 for irf3 and rip1 for nf-jb activation [9].
deregulated activation of tlrs can lead to severe systemic inﬂammatory and joint destructive process in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) [10]. ra is an autoimmune disease
characterized by chronic inﬂammation in most major joints
[10]. there are several anti-rheumatic drugs that can be
divided into two groups. first, the non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids), such as aspirin, are used to
suppress pain and inﬂammation. second, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) are used to limit
joint damage and to suppress the underlying autoimmune
dysfunction of ra [11]. the latter class of drugs includes
methotrexate, chloroquine,  xxxd3255xxx , d- xxxd2870xxx , and gold compounds such as auranoﬁn. the mechanism for the eﬃciency of these drugs on ra has not been
fully understood. recent strategies for drug development
have focused on cytokines that are detected in the synovium of ra. many cytokines such as tnf, il-1, il-6, il-8,
il-10, il-12, il-15, and il-18 are detected in the ra
except for il-4 [12,13]. the expression of these inﬂammatory cytokines can be regulated by tlr-nf-jb signaling
pathway [10].
gold compounds have been used for the treatment of
ra for more than 100 years [14]. the two most common
gold compounds used as anti-rheumatic drugs are sodium
aurothiomalate, which is water-soluble and administered
by the intramuscular route, and auranoﬁn, which is a
hydrophobic compound and can be taken orally [14]. both
compounds are au(i) compounds with sulfur-linked
organic ligands. these gold compounds inhibited endotoxin-induced il-1 and tnf production in the inﬂammatory
monocytes and macrophages in the ra synovial membranes [15,16]. gold compounds have also been shown to
inhibit the endotoxin-induced activation of nf-jb and
ap-1-dependent transfected reporter genes [17,18].
identifying the direct targets of gold compounds in tlr
pathways would be important because the activation of
tlrs by agonists can induce inﬂammatory responses and
consequently, increase the risk of the development of
chronic inﬂammatory diseases. therefore, we attempted
to identify the molecular target of gold compounds in
tlr signaling pathways.
materials and methods
reagents. auranoﬁn was purchased from biomol (plymouth meeting,
pa). sodium tetrachloroaurate(iii) dihydrate was purchased from sigma–
aldrich (st. louis, mo). puriﬁed lps was obtained from list biological
laboratory inc. all other reagents were purchased from sigma unless
otherwise described.
cell culture. ba/f3 cells, an  xxxg1177xxx -dependent murine pro-b cell line,
expressing tlr4 (flag or gfp-tagged), cd14, md2 (flag-tagged), and
nf-jb luciferase reporter gene were described previously [19]. cells were
cultured in rpmi1640 medium containing recombinant murine  xxxg1177xxx 
(70 u/ml), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs, invitrogen), 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (gibco-brl).
raw264.7 cells (a murine monocytic cell line, atcc tib-71) and 293t
cells (human embryonic kidney) were cultured in dulbecco’s modiﬁed

eagles’ medium (dmem) containing 10% (v/v) fbs, 100 u/ml penicillin,
and 100 lg/ml streptomycin. cells were maintained at 37 c in a 5% co2/
air environment.
transfection and reporter gene luciferase assay. nf-jb(2·)-luciferase
reporter gene assays were performed as described previously [20,21]. cells
were co-transfected with a luciferase plasmid and hsp70-b-galactosidase
plasmid as an internal control using superfect transfection reagent
(qiagen, valencia, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
various expression plasmids or equal amounts of empty vector for signaling components were co-transfected. luciferase enzyme activities were
determined using the luciferase assay system (promega, madison, wi)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. luciferase activity was
normalized by b-galactosidase activity.
immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. these were performed the
same as previously described [20]. protein extracts from ba/f3 cells
expressing tlr4 (flag or gfp-tagged), cd14, md2 (flag-tagged), and
nf-jb luciferase reporter gene for immunoprecipitation were prepared as
described [19]. the samples were immunoprecipitated with mouse-gfp
antibody (molecular probes inc., eugene, or) for overnight. the solubilized immune complex was resolved on 8% sds–page and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane. the membrane was
blocked with phosphate-buﬀered saline containing 0.1% tween 20 and 5%
non-fat dried milk and was blotted with the flag antibodies for overnight.
thereafter, the blot was exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (amersham biosciences, arlington heights, il) for
1 h and detected with ecl western blot detection reagents (amersham
biosciences, arlington heights, il). the blot was reprobed with rabbit
gfp antibodies.

auranoﬁn inhibited lps-induced nf-jb and irf3
activation and target gene (cox-2) expression
auranoﬁn, an anti-rheumatic gold compound, inhibited
lps-induced activation of nf-jb and irf3 as determined
by luciferase reporter gene assays in raw264.7 cells
(fig. 1a and b). the decrease in the activation of these
transcription factors resulted in the reduction of the expression of the target gene, cox-2 (fig. 1c).
lps-induced dimerization of tlr4 was inhibited by gold
compounds
we next determined whether auranoﬁn inhibits lps-induced dimerization of tlr4 using  xxxg1177xxx -dependent ba/f3
cells stably transfected with murine tlr4-flag and
tlr4-gfp, md2, cd14, and nf-jb-luciferase reporter
gene as described previously [19,22]. auranoﬁn inhibited
the dimerization of tlr4 (fig. 2a) induced by lps in a
dose-dependent manner. the inhibitory potency of auranoﬁn [au(i)] is greater than that of another gold compound,
tetrachloroauric(iii) acid [au(iii)]. the inhibition of tlr4
dimerization by the gold compounds was well-correlated
with the suppressive eﬀects on nf-jb activation (fig. 2b).
gold compounds inhibited both  xxxg1489xxx -dependent and
trif-dependent signaling pathways of tlr4
tlr4 activates both  xxxg1489xxx -dependent and -independent pathways. since the gold compounds inhibit the

factor. both auranoﬁn and au(iii) inhibited nf-jb activation induced by the overexpression of  xxxg1489xxx ,  xxxg1159xxx ,

discussion
several lines of evidence have shown the signiﬁcant role
of tlr4 in the development and progress of rheumatoid
arthritis. repeated exposure to lps, a tlr4 agonist, generates a mouse model of reactive arthritis [24]. the endogenous tlr4 agonists such as ﬁbrinogen and hyaluronan
are found in arthritis joints. small heat shock protein b8
(hsp22) abundantly expressed in synovial tissue from
patients with rheumatoid arthritis was identiﬁed as a
tlr4 agonist [25]. mice deﬁcient of  xxxg1489xxx , an adaptor
molecule of tlr, did not develop streptococcal cell
wall-induced arthritis [26]. some anti-rheumatic gold compounds have been shown to suppress lps activity. auranoﬁn and gold sodium thiomalate inhibited lps-induced
production of il-1 or tnf in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or murine macrophages [15,16]. therefore, the
anti-rheumatic activity of gold compounds has been partly
explained by the down-regulation of the expression of
inﬂammatory mediators. however, the mechanism through
which gold compounds suppress lps activity has not been
fully understood. the homodimer formation of tlr4 in

or p65 in 293t cells (fig. 3a–c). lps-induced irak-1
degradation was also inhibited by gold compounds
(fig. 3d).
the results suggest that gold compounds inhibit nf-jb
activation induced by  xxxg1489xxx -dependent pathway of
tlr4. the trif-dependent pathway of tlr4 leads to
the activation of irf3 transcription factor mediated
through tbk1 [23]. gold compounds also inhibited trifor tbk1 (downstream kinase of trif-dependent pathway)-induced irf3 activation as demonstrated by the
transcription activation and the phosphorylation of irf3
(fig. 4a–c). these results showed that gold compounds
inhibit trif/tbk1/irf3 signaling pathway of tlr4.
together, our results demonstrate that gold compounds
have the multiple targets in tlr4 signaling pathways to
inhibit the nf-jb and irf3 activation.

response to an agonist is considered as a critical step to
recruit the adapter molecules and to trigger the activation
of downstream signaling pathways [19]. our study demonstrated that auranoﬁn, an anti-rheumatic gold compound,

and tetrachloroauric(iii) acid to a lesser extent, suppress
lps-induced formation of tlr4 homodimers. the suppression resulted in the decrease of the activation of downstream transcription factors, irf3 and nf-jb. therefore,

our results suggest a novel mechanism as to how gold compounds suppress lps activity and exert anti-rheumatic
activity.
the biochemical mechanism as to how auranoﬁn interacts with tlr4 to exert the inhibitory eﬀects is not understood. cysteine residues have been implicated as potential
targets for gold compounds. gold(i) salts have a high thiol
binding aﬃnity. auranoﬁn inhibits ijb kinase but the cysteine mutant of  xxxg1159xxx  (c179a) is resistant to inhibition
[27]. this suggests that auranoﬁn inhibits ikk by modifying cys179 of  xxxg1159xxx . in addition, gold salts react with
cys272 and cys154 in the dna-binding domains of jun
and fos, respectively, thereby inhibiting dna binding
and transcription of  xxxg1222xxx  [28]. tlrs
have several cysteine residues, which form disulﬁde bonds
for the dimerization of the receptors, in both cytoplasmic
and extracellular domains [29]. therefore, it can be speculated that auranoﬁn may bind to cysteine residues of tlr4
to interfere with the activation.
the engagement of tlr4 by lps establishes stably sustained phase of nf-jb activation composed of the early
phase that is dependent on  xxxg1489xxx  and the trif-dependent delayed phase [30]. the activation of irf3 through
trif and tbk1 is responsible for the late phase of nfjb activation. irf3 activation leads to the expression of
 xxxg2296xxx  which in turn acts on  xxxg2296xxx  receptor to trigger
the delayed activation of nf-jb. therefore, trif/
tbk1/irf3 pathway is now recognized to play an important role in tlr-mediated inﬂammation. our results
showed that auranoﬁn suppressed the functional activity
of trif and tbk1 as demonstrated by the phosphorylation and the transcriptional activation of irf3.
several gold compounds such as auranoﬁn, aurothiomalate,  xxxd2834xxx , and aucl3 were shown to inhibit
kinase activity of ikk immune complex prepared by the
immunoprecipitation with  xxxg463xxx  antibody [31]. this was
suggested as the mechanism through which gold
compounds suppress nf-jb activation. consistently,
auranoﬁn, aurathioglucose, and aurothiomalate inhibited
 xxxd2925xxx  (tpa)-induced
nuclear translocation of nf-jb in rat peritoneal macrophages when cells were treated with each of the gold compounds [32]. however, the contradicting results on the
eﬀect of each gold compound on nf-jb activation were
also reported. aurothiomalate did not suppress  xxxg2296xxx -induced nf-jb activation in huvec as determined by
emsa while auranoﬁn inhibited the nf-jb activation
[33]. our study demonstrated that auranoﬁn inhibited
 xxxg1159xxx -induced nf-jb reporter activity. in addition,
auranoﬁn and tetrachloroauric(iii) acid suppressed p65-induced nf-jb reporter activity suggesting the direct inhibition of p65 transcriptional activity by gold compounds.
collectively, our study for the ﬁrst time demonstrated
that auranoﬁn inhibits the dimerization of tlr4 and the
activation of trif-dependent signaling pathways. auranoﬁn and other gold compound suppress tlr signaling at
multiple steps. these results provide an important clue to

understand the mechanism for gold compounds to exert
anti-rheumatic activity.
