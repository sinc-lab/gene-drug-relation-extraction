abstract
we provide comprehensive knowledge on the differential regulation of expression and catalysis of cyclooxygenase (cox)-1
and cox-2 in health and disease which represents an essential requirement to read out the clinical consequences of selective
and nonselective inhibition of cox-isozymes in humans. furthermore, we describe the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
characteristics of major traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tnsaids) and coxibs (selective cox-2 inhibitors) which
play a prime role in their efficacy and toxicity. important information derived from our pharmacological studies has clarified
that nonselective cox inhibitors should be considered the tnsaids with a balanced inhibitory effect on both cox-isozymes
(exemplified by ibuprofen and naproxen). in contrast, the tnsaids  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx  and diclofenac (which are from 18- to
29-fold more potent towards cox-2 in vitro) and coxibs (i.e. celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx , rofecoxib,  xxxd2069xxx  and  xxxd2517xxx , which
are from 30- to 433-fold more potent towards cox-2 in vitro) should be comprised into the cluster of cox-2 inhibitors. however,
the dose and frequency of administration together with individual responses will drive the degree of cox-2 inhibition and selectivity
achieved in vivo. the results of clinical pharmacology of cox inhibitors support the concept that the inhibition of platelet cox-1
may translate into an increased incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal bleeding but this effect on platelet cox-1 may mitigate
the cardiovascular hazard associated with the profound inhibition of cox-2-dependent prostacyclin (pgi2 ).

prostanoids are a cluster of bioactive lipids [i.e. prostaglandin (pg) e2 , pgf2␣ ,  xxxg1073xxx  , prostacyclin (pgi2 ) and
thromboxane (tx) a2 ], which interact with specific cell-membrane receptors of the superfamily of g-proteincoupled, playing important roles in many cellular responses and pathophysiologic processes, such as modulation
of the inflammatory reaction and its resolution, erosion of cartilage and juxtaarticular bone, gastrointestinal (gi)
cytoprotection and ulceration, angiogenesis and cancer, haemostasis and thrombosis, renal hemodynamics and progression of kidney disease, atheroprotection and progression of atherosclerosis [1,2]. they are generated through
the cyclooxygenase (cox) and peroxidase activity of pgg/h synthase-1 and -2 (known as cox-1 and cox2) which catalyze the conversion of free  xxxd208xxx  (aa) to pgg2 , and then to pgh2 . the different
prostanoids are generated from the intermediate pgh2 through the activity of tissue-specific isomerases and synthases
[3].
aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [collectively known as traditional (t)nsaids] and
selective cox-2 inhibitors (coxibs) cause antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions, through their
competitive inhibition of cox active site of cox-2—apart from aspirin which modifies irreversibly the catalytic activity of cox-2 [1,3,4]. tnsaids and coxibs result clinically equivalent for the relief of acute pain
and symptoms of arthropathies at doses which cause a comparable profound suppression of cox-2 activity
[3,5].
coxibs (i.e. celecoxib,  xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd2517xxx , rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx ) were developed with the aim to reduce
the incidence of serious upper gi adverse events associated with the administration of tnsaids, as a consequence
of the inhibition of cox-1-derived prostanoids [1–3]. however, the reduced incidence of serious gi adverse effects
compared to tnsaids demonstrated for two selective cox-2 inhibitors (i.e. rofecoxib and  xxxd2517xxx ) has been
countered by an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke detected in five placebo controlled trials involving celecoxib, rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx  [6,8–11]. the results of a recent large nested case-control study
using data from the uk general practice research database have shown that an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction is attached to the first generation (celecoxib and rofecoxib) but also second generation ( xxxd2069xxx 
and  xxxd3481xxx ) of selective cox-2 inhibitors [12]. suppression of cox-2-derived pgi2 , leaving unconstrained
prothrombotic and atherogenic stimuli, such as txa2 , is a plausible mechanism involved in the increased cardiovascular risk attached to coxibs [2]. however, the results of numerous observational studies with tnsaids, despite
being conflicting, have led to consider a possible cardiovascular hazard associated also with tnsaids [2,13]. however, misleading knowledge may be achieved when combined analyses of vascular events, recorded for different
tnsaids in population-based observational studies or meta-analysis of randomised trials, are performed. in fact,
tnsaids are a heterogeneous cluster of compounds in respect of pharmacodynamic (i.e. cox-1/cox-2 selectivity) and pharmacokinetic features [14], thus, each drug should be evaluated separately for its cardiovascular
risk.
this review aims to provide comprehensive knowledge on the differential regulation of expression and catalysis of
cox-1 and cox-2 in health and disease which represents an essential requirement to read out the clinical consequences
of selective and nonselective inhibition of cox-isozymes in humans. secondly, we describe the pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the major tnsaids and coxibs which play a prime role in efficacy and toxicity
outcomes evidenced in clinical trials.
1. regulation of cox-1 and cox-2 expression and activity
despite cox-1 and cox-2 share the same catalytic activities, i.e. cyclooxygenase and peroxidase [15], they are
differently regulated. in fact, it has been shown that cox-2 requires considerably lower levels of hydroperoxides to
initiate cyclooxygenase catalysis than those required by cox-1 [16]. moreover, the cox-2 activity occurs at lower
levels of free aa than cox-1 activity [17]. another important difference between the two pathways of prostanoid
biosynthesis is related on the regulation of the expression of cox-1 and cox-2 genes. in fact, cox-1 has the structural
features of an “housekeeping” gene while cox-2 those of an immediate early gene [3,18–20]. moreover, both mrna
and protein of cox-1 are more stable than those of cox-2 [21].
these important differences in the regulation of catalysis and expression of cox-1 and cox-2 have led to the
development of tissue-specific pathways of prostanoid biosynthesis dominated by one or the other enzyme in vivo
in health and disease. we will describe some examples of cell-specific prostanoid biosynthesis driven by cox-2 or
cox-1.

1.1. endothelial cox-2
in vascular endothelial cells, cox-2 plays a dominant role in producing important prostanoids to regulate the
functions of underlying vascular smooth muscle cells and circulating cells. although, endothelial cells may generate
a different array of the prostanoids  xxxg1073xxx  , pge2 and pgi2 along the vascular beds, robust evidences sustain that pgi2
is the dominant prostanoid produced in the macrocirculation [2,22].
pgi2 potently inhibits aggregation of platelets induced by all recognized agonists, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and vascular tone in vitro and in vivo, leukocyte–endothelial cell interactions and  xxxg430xxx 
[2]. recently, it has been reported an antioxidant role for pgi2 through the induction of hemoxygenase-1 [23]. for all
these biological actions, pgi2 has on the distinctive features of a cardioprotective mediator.
it is now generally recognized that the vascular endothelium is a dynamically mutable interface which models
itself to local and systemic stimuli (i.e. activated platelets, growth factors, inflammatory stimuli, etc.) and to various
biomechanical forces, generated by the pulsatile flow of blood through the branched arterial vasculature. all these factors
will play a part in the induction of specific phenotypes through the modulation of the expression of both protective and
pathological relevant genes [24]. among vasoprotective genes up-regulated by steady laminar (physiologic) shear stress
stimulation, cox-2 is included. thus, cox-2 but not cox-1 is induced in response to physiological levels of laminar
shear stress [24]. the modulation of cellular cox-2 levels, through manifold mechanisms involving its expression and
degradation, makes this biosynthetic pathway suitable to respond to the requirements of the endothelium which has to
put into effect a swift phenotypic adjustment in response to changes of signals aroused from the circulation. moreover,
endothelial cells have been suggested to produce low levels of hydroperoxides [25], this will direct prostanoid synthesis
mainly through cox-2 in the presence of the contemporary expression of the 2 isozymes in vivo. however, difficulty
to evidence cox-2-like immunoreactivity – while cox-1 is easily detectable – in post-mortem human vascular tissues
and in endothelial cells cultured in static conditions, prompted some researchers to postulate that cox-1 is the dominant
isoform that contribute to pgi2 biosynthesis in physiologic conditions [26]. however, it has to be specified steadfastly
that the suggestion of dominant cox-1-dependent biosynthesis of vascular pgi2 in vivo does not take into consideration
that cox-2 mrna and protein may undergo a rapid degradation during collection and handling of vascular tissues.
in fact, the cox-2 gene is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and is often
expressed in a transient manner [21]. in unstimulated cells, cox-2 mrna is transcribed at a low rate and degraded
rapidly, resulting in low basal levels of expression. the instability of cox-2 mrna is determined by its 3-untranslated
region (utr) which presents several copies of the mrna destabilizing motif auuua. the competition between
stabilizing and destabilizing au-rich elements (are)-binding proteins is thought to determine mrna decay rates
[21]. a level of translational regulation, which may also involve the 3-utr has been further suggested. stabilization
of short-lived mrna of cox-2 by cytokine-dependent activation of p38 mitogen induced activated protein kinase
(mapk) pathway has been described [27] and may explain the detection of cox-2 in post-mortem atherosclerotic
tissues [28] and in endothelial cells cultured in vitro in response to inflammatory stimuli [29]. importantly, we wish
to highlight that detection of cox-isozyme expression by western blot or immunohistochemistry in a tissue does
not ensure its actual prostanoid biosynthesis. in particular, in endothelial cells cultured in static conditions in vitro
which express only cox-1, prostanoids are undetectable in the medium but can be easily measured in the presence of
exogenous aa (30 ␮m), thus demonstrating that at low levels of free endogenous aa and possibly hydroperoxides,
cox-1 is inactive (unpublished personal results). however, endothelial pgi2 biosynthesis, from endogenously released
aa, occurs when cox-2 expression is induced in response to an inflammatory trigger, such as bacterial endotoxin
(lipopolysaccharide, lps) [personal results and ref. 29]. altogether these evidences sustain persuasively that both
in physiologic and pathologic conditions, cox-2 expression represents the rate-limiting step in pgi2 biosynthesis.
this is confirmed by the finding that the administration of selective cox-2 inhibitors to healthy subjects suppresses
pgi2 biosynthesis (as assessed by the measurement of a major enzymatic urinary metabolite, i.e. 2,3-dinor-6-ketopgf1␣ ) >60% similarly to ibuprofen and indomethacin, which are balanced inhibitors of both cox-isozymes [30,31].
furthermore, cheng et al. [32] have reported that in the mouse, the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-pgf1␣ is
suppressed substantially by cox-2 inhibition (celecoxib) or knockout, or mutation of cox-2, i.e. replacement of
tyr385 with phenylalanine.
since these studies in mice and humans have been performed by assessing the urinary levels of 2,3-dinor-6-ketopgf1␣ , which is a marker of systemic, actual biosynthesis of pgi2 in vivo, it has been questioned that other cellular
sources, besides endothelial cells, contribute to the urinary levels of the pgi2 metabolite. the convincing evidence

88

in favour of its vascular origin emerges from the finding that urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-pgf1␣ is excreted in greater
amounts in clinical settings in which platelet–vascular interactions are increased [33]. these results led to propose
that the biosynthesis of pgi2 may represent an adaptable response of vascular endothelium that limits the degree or
effects of platelet activation. this concept has recently taken shape by the finding that in catheter-induced carotid injury
in mice, deletion of  xxxg1879xxx  (ip) augments the proliferative vascular response and txa2 biosynthesis in vivo
while deletion of tx receptor (tp) diminishes these responses [34]. however, these results sustain the involvement of
vascular pgi2 as a protective mechanism switched on as a consequence of vascular damage while leaving unresolved
the role played by this mediator in healthy individuals. in the approve (adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx)
trial, an increased incidence of major cardiovascular events (rr: 1.92; 95% ci: 1.19–3.11) was detected at 18 months
of chronic treatment with rofecoxib 25 mg, in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas [9]. a possible mechanistic
interpretation of these results is that the administration of selective cox-2 inhibitors, for extended periods, to subjects
at initial low cardiovascular risk may lead to an acceleration of the developing risk, in a subset of individuals with a
cardiovascular phenotype tightly dependent on pgi2 . the proof of concept of this hypothesis comes from our recent
study [35] in subjects carriers of  xxxg2290xxx  (tlr4) polymorphisms asp299gly who have been reported to
be associated with decreased atherosclerosis and reduced risk of acute coronary events. in this setting, intima-media
thickness (imt) of the common carotid arteries, a surrogate measure for systemic vessel disease, was significantly
lower than in carriers of wild-type tlr4, and correlated with the biosynthesis of txa2 in vivo, as assessed by
the measurement of the urinary excretion of its major enzymatic metabolite 11-dehydro-txb2 . interestingly, imt
was inversely correlated to the pgi2 /txa2 biosynthesis ratio that persuaded us to speculate that endothelial pgi2
might restrain platelet txa2 biosynthesis in vivo in this setting. this hypothesis was addressed by evaluating the
consequences of the administration of rofecoxib and  xxxd2069xxx . we found that the selective inhibition of cox-2dependent pgi2 biosynthesis (≈60%) by coxibs caused a different effect on txa2 biosynthesis in vivo in carriers of
tlr4 polymorphisms versus carriers of tlr4 wild type. in fact, in carriers of tlr4 polymorphisms, selective cox-2
inhibition caused a statistically significant 95% mean increase of urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-txb2 from predrug
values. differently, in wild type, a nonsignificant 19% mean reduction of tx metabolite excretion from predrug values
was found. importantly, the findings of this study suggest that the cardioprotective phenotype associated with tlr4
polymorphisms may be modified by selective inhibition of cox-2 [35]. larger sample-size studies with different
selective cox-2 inhibitors need to be performed in this setting to corroborate the occurrence of the mechanism
evidenced in the present study. interestingly, people carrying tlr4 polymorphism have been reported to benefit more
from pravastatin treatment than those without polymorphisms [36]. collectively these results suggest that patient’s
genotype profile will permit to identify patients who most likely will benefit or be susceptible to toxic effects from a
coxib therapy.
another issue claimed by some researchers is that cox-2 inhibitors may confer a cardiovascular risk through
inhibition of other prostanoids, such as pge2 which in vivo is produced mainly through cox-2 even in healthy
subjects [37]. however, recently, cheng et al. [32] have reported that deletion of  xxxg1876xxx , a major source of pge2 ,
in contrast to deletion or inhibition of cox-2, does not predispose the animals to thrombosis or elevate blood pressure.
this may imply the unimportance of pge2 as a constraint on thrombogenic and hypertensive stimuli even if diversion of
the pgh2 substrate to pgi2 synthase ( xxxg1880xxx ), augmenting the production of pgi2 , might have mitigated the consequence
of pge2 suppression.
1.2. platelet cox-1
platelet txa2 biosynthesis is an example of prostanoid production cox-1 derived. in platelets, aa, released in
response to primary agonists, such as thrombin and  xxxd80xxx , is offered to cox-1, for its transformation
to prostaglandin endoperoxide pgh2 that is, then, isomerized to txa2 by the activity of txa2 synthase ( xxxg2254xxx )
[38,39]. txa2 causes platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and vascular proliferation [2]. several lines of evidence
sustain that cox-1 is the only cox isoform expressed in mature platelets which is involved in txa2 generation in vitro
and in vivo: (i) in highly purified human platelet suspensions isolated from healthy subjects, we found that cox-2 is
undetectable while cox-1 is readily revealable by specific western blot techniques [40]; (ii) platelet txa2 generation
is inhibited by a highly selective cox-1 inhibitor in vitro while is unaffected by selective cox-2 inhibitors both in
vitro and ex vivo even in patients with coronary heart disease [41,42]; (iii) the administration of cox-2 inhibitors
does not affect platelet aggregation ex vivo and does not interfere with the irreversible inhibition of platelet txa2

89

generation by aspirin [30,43]; (iv) overview analysis of indirect comparisons in clinical trials shows saturation of the
antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin at low doses [44].
txa2 biosynthesis is a rather unique example of prostanoid release largely dependent on enhanced substrate
availability [45]. thus, the activation of phospholipases is a rate-limiting step in txa2 production. alteration in
aa supply through endogenous and exogenous routes significantly affects the coupling between cox-isozymes and
terminal prostanoid synthases. in platelets, a coupling between cox-1 and  xxxg2254xxx  is promoted for the high availability
of free aa upon receptor stimulation [17].
platelet txa2 biosynthesis is, presumably, turned off through two main mechanisms: (i) the decrease in txa2
synthesis for suicide inactivation of cox-1 and  xxxg2254xxx  and (ii) the irreversible sticking of platelets associated with
the release of their intracellular granules. cox-1 is a self-inactivating enzyme. both the peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities have a limited number of catalytic turnovers [15]. based on the protective effect of various reducing
cosubstrates, it has been proposed the involvement of active radical intermediates, formed during the peroxidase or
cyclooxygenase catalysis, in the irreversible loss of enzyme activity [46]. similarly,  xxxg2254xxx  undergoes suicide inactivation during catalysis, presumably, via two mechanisms: (i) a covalent modification of the enzyme due to a tight
association with pgh2 or with an intermediate product not yet identified and (ii) a modification or dissociation of the
heme prosthetic group [47]. moreover, both cox-1 and  xxxg2254xxx  activities may be modulated by the cellular levels of
lipid hydroperoxides and/or  xxxd2738xxx  [15,48].
aspirin inactivates irreversibly platelet cox-1 activity through a selective acetylation of a specific serine residue
(ser529 ) of human cox-1 which translates into an almost complete suppression (>95%) of platelet capacity to produce
txa2 at low doses standing throughout the 24-h dosing interval [49]. this complete and perpetual suppression of
platelet cox-1 activity by aspirin is mandatory to fulfill its cardioprotection because of a nonlinear relationship of
inhibition of platelet txa2 generation with inhibition of txa2 -mediated platelet aggregation: thus, an excess of 95%
inhibition of cox-1 activity is required to influence platelet function [50]. in fact, even tiny concentrations of txa2
have been shown to cause platelet activation [42,51–53].
in contrast, nonaspirin tnsaids, which are reversible inhibitors of platelet cox-1 and generally cause an incomplete
and intermittent inhibition of platelet txa2 biosynthesis, may be inadequate to prevent cardiovascular events, as
shown by the results of epidemiologic studies [44]. however, naproxen at therapeutic doses of 500 mg bid gets into
the functionally relevant range of inhibition of platelet cox-1 activity ex vivo (i.e. >95%) at the end of the dosing
interval in some, even if not in all, subjects [54]. such heterogeneity might explain the weak and irregular signal of
cardioprotection from naproxen in epidemiologic analyses [13].
1.3. gastric cox-1
cox-1 is the major cox isoform expressed in gastric mucosa of healthy individuals which produces the cytoprotective pge2 and pgi2 . the development of gastro-duodenal lesions in a large proportion of patients exposed to
tnsaids is plausibly a consequence of persistent, moderate inhibition of mucosal cox-1 activity [45]. differently,
the increased risk of upper gi bleeding complications detected in tnsaid users – some of which can be serious or
even fatal – has been proposed to occur as a result of transient, high-grade inhibition of platelet cox-1 in a very
small percentage of exposed patients [45]. the improved gi tolerability demonstrated for two highly selective cox-2
inhibitors, rofecoxib and  xxxd2517xxx , lies in the sparing of cox-1 activity in the gastric mucosa and platelets [6,7].
the important contribution of the alteration of haemostasis in the serious gi events caused by tnsaids is sustained
by the fact that the advantage of selective cox-2 inhibitors – which do not affect platelet txa2 biosynthesis – is lost
when these drugs are coadministered with low-dose aspirin [7].
2. classiﬁcation of cox inhibitors based on pharmacodynamic
the biochemical selectivity of cox inhibitors towards cox-2 is currently assessed using the human whole blood
assays [55,56]. these assays are based on the measurement of pge2 production, in response to lps added to heparinized
blood samples for 24 h which reflects the time-dependent induction of cox-2 in circulating monocytes [55]. the parallel
measurement of txb2 production during whole blood clotting is used as an index of platelet cox-1 activity [56]. in
fact, serum txb2 represents the major product of aa metabolism in platelets by cox-1 activity. using the human
whole blood assays we assessed the inhibition of platelet cox-1 and monocyte cox-2 activities by cox inhibitors in

fig. 1. concentration–response curves for inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 in human whole blood assays by celecoxib and diclofenac in vitro.
diclofenac and celecoxib show the same cox-1/cox-2 biochemical selectivity in vitro (cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratio: 29 and 30, respectively)
[14,57,58]; although there is a difference in potency (diclofenac: ic50 0.38 ␮m for cox-1 and 0.013 ␮m for cox-2; celecoxib: ic50 16 ␮m for
cox-1 and 0.54 ␮m for cox-2), the concentration–response curves of celecoxib and diclofenac are superimposable.

vitro. assessment of ic50 values (i.e. the concentration of the drug required to inhibit cox activity by 50%) for cox-1
and cox-2 and the calculation of cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratios for different cox inhibitors allowed to evidence that the
biochemical selectivity of cox inhibitors is a continuous variable thus it is quite difficult to fix a cox-1/cox-2 ic50
value which separates nonselective from selective nsaids [14,57]. however, for a cluster of compounds including the
profens (ibuprofen,  xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd2141xxx ) and naproxen it is apt to classify them as nonselective nsaids for their
balanced inhibitory effect towards cox-1 and cox-2 activities. in contrast, the cluster of cox-2 inhibitors should
include the tnsaids  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx  and diclofenac (which are from 18- to 29-fold more potent towards
cox-2 in vitro) and coxibs. among coxibs, we evidenced a wide cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratio which ranges from 30
for celecoxib to 433 for  xxxd2517xxx  and inside we have  xxxd3481xxx , rofecoxib and  xxxd2069xxx  with cox-1/cox-2
ic50 values of 61, 272 and 344, respectively [58]. interestingly, we evidenced that the tnsaid diclofenac and the
coxib celecoxib show a comparable cox-2 selectivity in vitro (cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratio: 29 and 30, respectively).
although there is a difference in potency (diclofenac: ic50 0.38 ␮m for cox-1 and 0.013 ␮m for cox-2; celecoxib:
ic50 16 ␮m for cox-1 and 0.54 ␮m for cox-2), the concentration–response curves of celecoxib and diclofenac are
superimposable, in vitro (fig. 1). other evidences sustain that the two drugs have similar pharmacodynamic traits:
(i) similarly to selective cox-2 inhibitors diclofenac does not undermine the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin
when the drugs are co-administered to healthy subjects [43]; (ii) superimposition of gi and cardiovascular events
has been detected in celecoxib long-term arthritis safety study (class) [59], in the two sub-studies performed in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) or osteoarthritis (oa): one comparing the effects of celecoxib, 400 mg bid,
and ibuprofen, 800 mg tid, for 12 months and the other comparing the effects of celecoxib and diclofenac, 75 mg
bid, for 15 months [59].
3. development of biomarkers to deﬁne bioequivalent doses of cox inhibitors for efﬁcacy and toxicity
it has been shown that cox-2 inhibition, as determined by pge2 levels in lps-stimulated whole blood in vitro, can
be used as a marker to predict drug efficacy in humans [5]. in fact, ic80 values have been found to correlate directly with
the analgesic/anti-inflammatory plasma concentrations of different cox inhibitors [5]. cryer and feldman reported
that the inhibitory effects of tnsaids on gastric pge2 synthesis correlate with cox-1 inhibitory potency in clotting
blood (p < 0.001) which can be used as a biomarker of gastric toxicity of cox inhibitors [60]. at the same time,
the extent of inhibition of whole blood cox-2 and cox-1 activities may acquaint on the impact of the drugs on
cardiovascular homeostasis. in fact, 2 important concepts have to be taken into consideration: (i) due to a nonlinear
relationship between cox-1 inhibition ex vivo and txa2 inhibition in vivo, a drug will be cardioprotective if, at the
therapeutic concentrations, will cause an almost complete suppression (>95%) of platelet cox-1 activity in clotting
blood [50]; (ii) due to a linear relationship between cox-2 inhibition ex vivo and pgi2 inhibition in vivo (unpublished
personal results), the profound suppression (70–80%) of cox-2 activity required for efficacy [5] will translate into a
substantial deficit of the cardioprotective action of pgi2 . to verify the impact of therapeutic doses of some tnsaids
and cox-2 inhibitors on cox-1 and cox-2 activities, we compared the plasma concentrations achieved after dosing

60 mg and  xxxd2517xxx  400 mg) with the concentrations inhibiting by 80% cox-1 activity in whole blood in vitro (empty bars). (b) comparison of
therapeutic concentrations (full bars) of nonselective tnsaids and cox-2 inhibitors with those inhibiting by 80% cox-2 activity in whole blood
in vitro (empty bars).

[5,61] with the ic80 values of the same drugs to inhibit platelet cox-1 and monocyte cox-2 as determined in the
whole blood assays in vitro [14,55,57,62].
as shown in fig. 2a and b, plasma concentrations of ibuprofen and naproxen achieved when the two drugs are
administered at the therapeutic daily doses of 1200–3200 and 500–1000 mg, respectively, are higher than those necessary to inhibit by 80% both cox-1 and cox-2 activities in vitro, suggesting that the two drugs, at therapeutic plasma
levels, cause a balanced and almost complete suppression of cox-isozymes thus mirroring the pharmacodynamic
profile of nonselective nsaids when administered in vivo at therapeutic doses. interestingly, the therapeutic plasma
concentrations of cox-2 inhibitors (an heterogeneous cluster of drugs with cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratios > 10 in vitro)
are from 2-fold (for diclofenac) to 200-fold (for  xxxd3481xxx ) lower than those inhibiting platelet cox-1 by 80%,
thus demonstrating a variable impact on cox-1, driven by the dose and selectivity. using this approach, we explored
whether therapeutic plasma concentrations at doses recommended for efficacy were equivalent in respect of the degree
of inhibition of cox-2 activity. as shown in fig. 2b, therapeutic concentrations of  xxxd2727xxx  (100–200 mg), rofecoxib
(25–50 mg) and  xxxd2069xxx  (60 mg) are proper to inhibit more than 80% cox-2 activity. diclofenac (150–200 mg) and
 xxxd2517xxx  (400 mg) plasma concentrations are 13- and 30-fold higher than those necessary to inhibit by 80% cox-2,

respectively. celecoxib (100–200 mg) and  xxxd3481xxx  (10 mg) plasma concentrations are two- to four-fold lower. an
important information resulting from this analysis is that therapeutic concentration of  xxxd2517xxx  administered at
400 mg daily is overshooting of ic80 for cox-2. we have previously evidenced that the plasma levels of the drug
detected at 24 h after dosing are still proper to suppress cox-2 activity profoundly (approximately 64%; ref. [62]). this
may explain the clinical efficacy of 400 mg  xxxd2517xxx  when administered once daily despite its short pharmacokinetic
half-life of 3–4 h. our analysis illustrates the influence of the dose administered on cox-2 selectivity achieved in vivo
for drugs with low cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratio.
4. conclusions
the knowledge of clinical pharmacology of cox inhibitors is of valuable help to give a mechanistic interpretation
of the results of clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of cox inhibitors.
first of all we have understood that nonselective nsaids are only those tnsaids with a balanced inhibitory effect
on both cox-isozymes. the substantial inhibition of platelet cox-1 will translate into an increased incidence of serious
upper gi bleeding on the basis of the suggestion that a profound even if not persistent suppression of platelet cox-1 will
translate into an increased incidence of serious gi complications [45]. this is sustained by the results of therapeutic
arthritis research and gi event trial (target) [7] and vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research study (vigor)
[6] showing that naproxen and ibuprofen cause increased gi adverse events than cox-2 inhibitors ( xxxd2517xxx  and
rofecoxib) which spare cox-1 activity at therapeutic dosing. on the other side, this inhibitory effect on platelet cox-1
by nonselective tnsaids may mitigate the cardiovascular hazard associated with the profound inhibition of cox2-dependent pgi2 . this is supported by the results of recent epidemiological studies showing undetectable risk of
myocardial infarction associated with the administration of ibuprofen, no effect or a small reduction of cardiovascular
risk with naproxen [12,13]. this effect of naproxen may be explained by our results of clinical pharmacology showing
that the therapeutic dose of naproxen 500 mg bid causes a profound and persistent suppression of platelet cox-1
activity (comparable to aspirin) in some but not all individuals [54].
we have revealed that diclofenac has pharmacodynamic features of celecoxib. this is confirmed by the results of
clinical trials comparing the two drugs showing undetectable difference in the incidence of upper gi complications
[59]. moreover, diclofenac has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of myocardial infarction
similar to celecoxib in epidemiological studies [12,13].
the finding that three selective cox-2 inhibitors, rofecoxib, celecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx , are associated with increased
risk of myocardial infarction in placebo controlled clinical trials [6,8–11] convincingly sustains that selective inhibition
of cox-2-dependent pgi2 unaccompanied by inhibition of platelet cox-1 translates into an increased cardiovascular
risk [2]. the reduction of the dose, frequency and duration of treatment together with the exclusion of patients at
high risk of thrombosis from the administration of selective cox-2 inhibitors is recommended. however, it should be
pointed out that this will lead to reduced efficacy because it is dependent on profound and persistent inhibition of cox-2
[5]. the development of biochemical and/or genetic biomarkers to identify the patients who are most susceptible to a
hazard or benefit by selective inhibition of cox-2 is the sole way to go forward.
