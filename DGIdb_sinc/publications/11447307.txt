hemodynamic effects of  xxxd358xxx  in patients with chronic heart failure.  a role of the potent and long-acting vasoconstrictor peptide  xxxg674xxx  and the pathophysiology of chronic human heart failure has been postulated based upon indirect evidence such as elevated plasma  xxxg674xxx  levels and their with the degree of hemodynamic impairment. the advent of specific of  xxxg676xxx  antagonists has provided the opportunity not only to directly evaluate its pathophysiological role but also to assess its potential role as a new approach to heart failure therapy. this brief review summarizes the evidence linking  xxxg674xxx  to the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure and the clinical results obtained in patients during acute, intravenous and more prolonged, oral administration with  xxxd358xxx , a mixed et(a)/et(b)-receptor antagonist.  xxxd358xxx  acutely and during short-term oral therapy markedly improved hemodynamics in patients in addition to standard heart failure therapy, including an ace-inhibitor. these effects were associated with a reduced responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin system to diuretic therapy and reduced basal plasma aldosterone levels. although the hemodynamic and neurohumoral profile of short-term  xxxd358xxx  therapy looks promising for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure appropriate trials will have to be performed to document clinical benefit during long-term therapy. finally, the question remains open whether mixed  xxxg676xxx  antagonists like  xxxd358xxx  will have similar effects as compared to antagonists which block the et(a) receptor only.
