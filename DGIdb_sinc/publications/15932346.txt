(low molecular mass chitosan) and chito-oligomeric–monomeric
mixture. the yield of the latter was 14–16 % and 14–19 % respectively for papain- and pronase-catalysed reactions, depending
on the reaction time (1–5 h). hplc revealed the presence of
monomer(s) and oligomers of dp (degree of polymerization) 2–6,
which was also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption
ionization–time-of-flight ms. along with the chito-oligomers, the
appearance of only glcnac (n- xxxd2683xxx ) in pronasecatalysed chitosanolysis was indicative of its different action
pattern compared with papain. fourier-transform infrared, liquidstate 13 c-nmr spectra and cd analyses of chito-oligomeric–
monomeric mixture indicated the release of glcnac/glcnac-rich
oligomers. the monomeric sequence at the non-reducing ends of
chito-oligomers was elucidated using n-acetylglucosaminidase.
the chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture showed better growth

inhibitory activity towards bacillus cereus and escherichia coli
compared with native chitosan. optimum growth inhibition was
observed with chito-oligomers of higher dp having low degree
of acetylation. the latter caused pore formation and permeabilization of the cell wall of b. cereus, whereas blockage of nutrient
flow due to the aggregation of chito-oligomers–monomers was
responsible for the growth inhibition and lysis of e. coli, which
were evidenced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. the
spillage of cytoplasmic enzymes and native page of the cellfree supernatant of b. cereus treated with chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture further confirmed bactericidal activity of the latter.
use of papain and pronase, which are inexpensive and easily
available, for chitosanolysis, is of commercial importance, as the
products released are of considerable biomedical value.

introduction

papain and wheatgerm lipase was reported, although the enzyme
purity was in doubt [10,11].
recently, we have shown that a homogeneous isoenzyme of
aspergillus niger pectinase with polygalacturonase activity, as
well as highly purified preparations of pepsin, papain and pronase,
could depolymerize chitosan quantitatively, yielding lmmc
(low molecular mass chitosan), chito-oligomers and monomers
[12–14]. in the present study, emphasis was given for isolation and
biophysical characterization of chito-oligomers and monomers
obtained using papain and pronase and to identify the monomeric
sequence of the oligomers at the non-reducing end by enzymatic
means. in addition, the growth inhibitory activity of chitooligomeric–monomeric mixture, as well as the individual oligomers towards both gram-positive (bacillus cereus) and gramnegative (escherichia coli) bacteria, and their probable mode of
action are reported.

chitosan is a natural, non-toxic, co-polymer of  xxxd2211xxx  (glucosamine) and glcnac (n- xxxd2683xxx ) obtained after partial
de-n-acetylation of chitin, which, in turn, is a major component
of the shells of crustaceans and found commercially in the
offal of marine food processing industry [1]. in spite of its
abundance and various biofunctionalities, utilization of chitosan
is restricted, owing to its high molecular mass, high viscosity and,
thus, low absorption for in vivo applications [2]. recent studies
on chitosan depolymerization have drawn considerable attention,
since the products obtained are easily water-soluble and also
possess versatile biofunctional properties such as antitumour
[3–5], immuno-stimulating [2] and antimicrobial activities [6,7]
and are being used for alleviating problems due to osteoarthritis–
gastritis [8].
chitosanolysis could be achieved by physical, chemical or
enzymatic means, of which enzymatic depolymerization is preferred, since reaction and thus product formation could be controlled by means of ph, temperature and reaction time [9]. since
chitosanase, the enzyme for chitosanolysis, is expensive and
unavailable in bulk, there was a need to identify an alternative
and inexpensive way for obtaining chitosan depolymerization
products. during search for the same, susceptibility of chitosan to
various non-specific enzymes such as cellulase, pectinase, pepsin,

u.s.a.). biogel p2 and p30 were from bio-rad laboratories
(hercules, ca, u.s.a.).  xxxg1403xxx  (from
bovine kidney) was obtained from boehringer mannheim
(mannheim, germany). other chemicals used were of the highest
purity available.
chitosan, obtained by heterogeneous n-deacetylation of shrimp
chitin [15], was purified by dissolving in 1 % acetic acid, filtering
through a plug of glass wool to remove suspended particles and
finally precipitating with 2 % (v/v) na2 co3 . the precipitate was
thoroughly washed with water, freeze-dried and stored at cold
temperature.

with 200 mg of kbr, and 40 mg of the mixture was pelletized.
reproducibility of the spectra was verified on two preparations
and the da (degree of acetylation) was determined using the formula (a1655 cm−1 /a3450 cm−1 ) × 100/1.33, where a is the absorbance at these wavelengths, calculated from the baseline [16].
cd

gpc (gel-permeation chromatography; biogel p2 column), sds/
page and capillary zone electrophoresis were performed as described elsewhere [13,14]. furthermore, enzyme purity was
ascertained by rp-hplc (reverse phase hplc) and n-terminal
sequence analysis as described below.

cd spectra of samples (5 mg · ml−1 in 0.1 m hclo4 ) were recorded in a jasco j-810 automatic recording spectropolarimeter
(japan spectroscopic, tokyo, japan) continuously purged with
n2 before and during the experiment. slits were programmed
to yield 10 å (1 å = 10−10 m) bandwidth at each wavelength so
that the resolution was more or less constant. the spectra were
recorded between 200 and 240 nm and baseline was obtained
using 0.1 m hclo4 . after accumulation of scans, the spectra were
standardized to mean residual ellipticity expressed as theta in
degree · cm2 per residue using the mean residual mass of glcnac
[17].

rp-hplc

liquid state 13 c-nmr spectroscopy

mobile phase used were 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid (solvent i) and
acetonitrile/water (70:30, v/v) containing 0.05 % trifluoroacetic
acid (solvent ii). papain/pronase was dissolved in triple distilled
water and analysed by rp-hplc on the shimadzu lc-8a system.
then, 20 µl (10 mg · ml−1 ) of the enzyme solution was loaded on
to a shimpak octadecylsilane column (250 mm × 4.5 mm) previously equilibrated with the mobile phase (solvent i). after injecting enzyme, the column was washed with solvent i (10 min),
followed by gradient run consisting of 0 % solvent ii traversing
to 100 % in 90 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml · min−1 . the elution
was monitored at 230 and 280 nm.

chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture was dissolved in 1 ml of
2
h2 o (for chitosan, 0.98 ml of 2 h2 o + 0.02 ml of deuterium chloride was used). after ensuring complete dissolution, the spectra
were recorded with a bruker amx 400 spectrometer at 100 mhz
and 27 ◦c. the da was calculated using the equation, i ch3 /(i c1 +
i c2 + i c3 + i c4 + i c5 + i c6 ), where i is the intensity of methyl as
well as c1–c6 ring carbon atoms [18].

n-terminal amino acid analysis (automated gas-phase protein sequencing)

this was performed on applied biosystems protein sequenator
(model 789, applied biosystems, foster city, ca, u.s.a.), which
carries out edman degradation by supplying gaseous reagents for
the coupling and cleavage reactions.
prefractionation of chito-oligomers/monomers

chitosan solution (1 %; dissolved in 1 % acetic acid, ph adjusted
to 3.5) was separately treated with enzymes (i.e. papain and
pronase) in the ratio 100:1 (w/w), incubated for different periods
(1–5 h) at optimum temperature (37 ◦c), followed by arresting
the reaction by heat-denaturing the enzyme (100 ◦c, 5 min) and
adjusting the ph to 7.0 using 2 m naoh. the supernatant
separated by centrifugation (1000 g and 10 min) was concentrated
by freeze-drying and passed through a sephadex g15 column
(80 cm × 1.0 cm), and the fractions (1 ml; eluted with water)
containing reducing equivalents (i.e. oligomers/monomers) were
pooled and freeze-dried.
sem (scanning electron microscopy)

samples were spread on a double-sided conducting adhesive tape
pasted on to a metallic stub, subjected to gold covering and
observed under a scanning electron microscope (leo 435 vp;
leo electron microscopy, cambridge, u.k.) at 20 kv.
ftir (fourier-transform infrared) spectroscopy

ir spectral studies were performed in a perkinelmer 2000 spectrometer under dry air at ambient temperature using kbr pellets.

hplc

freeze-dried sample was subjected to hplc on an aminopropyl column (3.9 mm × 300 mm; waters associates, waters
technologies ireland, ida business park, drinagh, wexford,
ireland). acetonitrile/water (70:30) mixture was the mobile phase
used at a flow rate of 1.0 ml · min−1 . detection was performed
using refractive index detector and the column was precalibrated
with chito-oligomers, malto-oligomers and monomers.
maldi–tof-ms (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization–
time-of-flight ms)

this was done on kompact analytical seq maldi–tof mass
spectrometer (kratos, manchester, u.k.) at an accelerated voltage
of 30 kv using 2,5- xxxd30xxx  as the matrix.
identification of the non-reducing end residues of the oligomers

individual chito-oligomers were isolated using biogel p2 column
(100 cm × 0.3 cm) equilibrated with water and precalibrated with
chito-oligomers and monomers [19]. the oligomeric mixture as
well as the individual oligomers (up to 500 µg of reducing equivalents) were treated with  xxxg1403xxx  (0.5 unit),
incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h, followed by the reducing
equivalent assay according to the modified schales method [20].
indicator bacteria and inoculum preparation

strains of b. cereus f4810, e. coli mtcc 118, listeria monocytogenes scott a, yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859, staphylococcus aureus fri 722 and b. licheniformis cfr 1621 (indicator
bacterial cultures) were obtained from the culture collection
maintained in the food microbiology department of this institute.
the cultures were maintained at 6 ◦c on bhi (brain–heart infusion) agar slants (himedia, mumbai, india) and subcultured

chito-oligosaccharides as bactericidal agents

at 15 day intervals. before use, the culture was successively
propagated twice in bhi broth at 37 ◦c. cell suspensions of the
culture, individually, were prepared from 20 h-old bhi culture
broth with appropriate dilution in 0.85 % saline, giving individual
counts of 102 –106 cfu · ml−1 (where cfu stands for colonyforming unit).
bacterial growth inhibitory activity

antibacterial activity of chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture as
well as the individual oligomers was studied against indicator
bacterial strains, individually, in nutrient broth following the
method of chen et al. [21]. to 10 ml aliquots of nutrient broth
(himedia) supplemented with 0.5 % dextrose, a cell suspension
of specific bacterial strain (102 –106 cfu/tube) containing 0.1–
0.5 mg % levels of chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture and
0.05–0.1 mg % of individual chito-oligomers separated on biogel
p2 column was added. native chitosan solubilized in 1 % acetic
acid and ph adjusted to 6.0 was taken as the control. the tube
contents were mixed and incubated at 37 ◦c for approx. 20 h.
from these, 1 ml aliquots were transferred into fresh 9 ml nutrient
broth tubes, whereas the remaining broth aliquots were pourplated with bhi agar and incubated for 24 h at 37 ◦c. the plates
were observed for bacterial colonies and the tubes were observed
for turbidity. bactericidal activity was calculated using [(c − t)/
c] × 100, wherein c and t are colony numbers in the control and
chitosan sample plates respectively [7]. after 24 h of incubation,
0.5 ml aliquots (both from control and tube containing 106 cfu +
chitosan or chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture or individual
mono-oligomer/chito-oligomer) were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes followed by centrifugation. the pellets obtained were
treated with 0.3 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.0), fixed with glutaraldehyde (1 %) for 1 h at 4 ◦c and further treated with 10 % (v/v)
 xxxd102xxx  in a sequential manner. the dried samples were
subjected to sem.

results and discussion
enzyme activity

earlier, we reported that page of commercial papain gives two
bands, of which one was the major, whereas pronase showed a
single band [13,14]. the major band of papain, which was associated with both proteolytic and chitosanolytic activities, was isolated by gpc on a biogel p30 column. sds/page and capillary
zone electrophoresis of the latter, as well as pronase, also
showed a single band/peak, indicating their homogeneity [13,14].
furthermore, the appearance of a single peak on rp-hplc
confirmed their purity beyond ambiguity (figure 1). in addition,
n-terminal sequences of papain and pronase were found to be
ipeyvdyrek and sqgsvyxxpyad respectively. blast
analysis of the former was corresponding to the papain from
papaya latex [22], whereas that of pronase did not show any homology, since the n-terminal sequence of pronase, i.e. type xxi
protease from s. griseus, is yet to be determined. preincubation
of the purified papain and pronase with pmsf (sigma), an
inhibitor of serine proteases, resulted in complete inhibition of
both chitosanolytic and proteolytic activities, whereas treatment
with chito-oligomers (inhibitors of chitosanases) before the assay
did not show any such reduction in chitosanolytic activities of
papain and pronase.
the purified papain and pronase showed optimum chitosanolytic activity at ph 3.5 and 37 ◦c, with a specific activity of
1.78 and 1.16 units · mg of protein−1 respectively. papain showed
continuous depolymerization even after 12 h of incubation with a

negligible increment in the release of reducing equivalents beyond
4–5 h, whereas, for pronase, there was a decrease in the activity
after 4 h.
sem and molecular mass

native chitosan had a molecular mass of approx. 71 +
− 2 kda
as determined by viscometry and gpc (sepharose cl 4b
column, 200 cm × 0.9 cm). sem of chitosan showed a particlelike structure as a result of aggregation of individual chains by
inter- and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network, whereas
that of the chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture showed sparsely
distributed spongy-type morphology and required a much higher
magnification (× 2000) compared with native chitosan (× 500),
in support of their decreased molecular mass (figure 2).
prefractionation of chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture

upon centrifugation of the reaction mixture (1000 g and 10 min),
the major chitosanolytic product, lmmc, got sedimented out
(yield, 71–86 %), whereas the percentage yield of the chitooligomeric–monomeric mixture was 14–17 % and 14–19 % for
papain- and pronase-catalysed reactions respectively depending
on the reaction time (1–5 h). unless stated otherwise, further
biophysical characterizations were performed for 5 h samples.
ftir

native chitosan showed a da of approx. 26 %, whereas the chitooligomeric–monomeric mixture had a da of 35.2 and 37.8 %
respectively for papain- and pronase-catalysed reactions (figure 3). this increase in da, although surprising, was contributed
by lmmc, which had a da of 17 and 14 % respectively
for papain- and pronase-catalysed reactions [13,14], and the
average da of lmmc + chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture
was nevertheless equal to that of native chitosan [i.e. (17 +
35.2)/2 = 26.1 for papain and (14 + 37.8)/2 = 25.9 for pronase].
thus it could be concluded that both papain and pronase cleave

in the cd spectra (figure 4), domard [17] correlated the peak
near 211 nm due to eta → pi ∗ transition of glcnac and thus acetyl
content, which is independent of chain length, conformation,
ionic strength and ph. the chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture
obtained showed an increase in this peak height, indicating an
increase in the acetyl content, and between the two samples, the
pronase-catalysed product showed slightly more da, in agreement with ir observations.

only the glycosidic bonds leaving the n-acetyl groups intact,
thus confirming their depolymerizing action rather than a den-acetylating effect.
in the ir spectra (figure 3), a peak at 1320 cm−1 corresponds
to acetyl groups [23]. an increase in the intensity of this peak
in chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture compared with native
chitosan further confirmed increase in da, and from these it
is evident that both papain and pronase result in the release of
glcnac/glcnac-rich oligomers. a slight shift in the peak around
3370 cm−1 was indicative of orderliness of the products, probably due to increase in da [24]. the region between 1420 and
1435 cm−1 is considered to be conformation-sensitive for polysaccharides, which depends on the orientation of the primary hydroxy
group, and its shift in the chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture

c 2005 biochemical society

the da values of 35.4 and 37.2 %, deduced from nmr, respectively for chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture obtained using
papain and pronase were in good agreement with those
calculated by ir spectra. an increase in the peak height (figure 5) corresponding to –ch3 (≈ 25.0 p.p.m.) and –c=o (near
176.0 p.p.m.) of chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture in comparison with those of native chitosan further confirmed increased
da of these products. considerable change in the chemicalshift (delta) values (downfield shift, table 1) indicated an altered
conformation.
identification of monomers and determination of dp of oligomers

hplc profiles of the chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture are
depicted in figure 6. a sudden decrease in the viscosity of
chitosan solution after the addition of enzymes was indicative
of their exo-action, whereas appearance of oligomers of dp 2–6
as well as monomer(s) revealed simultaneous endo-action of

chito-oligosaccharides as bactericidal agents

proteases, confirming their non-specific activities during depolymerization of chitosan. the yield of chito-oligomers was maximal
with pronase-catalysed chitosanolysis, whereas papain resulted in
more of monomers ( xxxd2211xxx  and glcnac). their dp calculated by
gpc on biogel p2 (results not shown) and hplc profiles were
in good agreement with each other. papain caused release of
dimer to hexamer along with both the monomers, whereas pronase
formed only glcnac along with dimer to hexamer. the appearance of only glcnac in the latter was indicative of its different
action pattern in comparison with papain. the percentage yield
of individual oligomers as determined by hplc (table 2) was
comparable with that obtained from chitosanase from the strains
of penicillium [26].
maldi–tof-ms

the structures of these oligomers were deduced by subjecting
them to maldi–tof-ms (figure 7). papain gave rise to oligomers of dp 2 (376.6), dp 3 (530.8 and 561.4), dp 4 (760.5),
dp 5 (954.8), dp 6 (1083.2 and 1114.6) and to a minor extent

dp 7 (1396.5) and dp 8 (1490.6), which were not observed in
hplc, probably due to the lack of sensitivity. similarly, the
major oligomers obtained after chitosanolysis using pronase
corresponded to dp 2 (374.4 and 396.8), dp 3 (526.3 and 558.4),
dp 4 (716.8), dp 5 (922.6) and dp 6 (1030.5 and 1053.2),
whereas dp 7 (1287.4) and dp 9 (1620.2) were the minor
oligomeric products. a slight increase in the m/z values of some
of the oligomers could be due to their sodiated forms.
identification of the non-reducing-end residues of the oligomers

treatment of the chito-oligomeric mixture obtained from papain
with  xxxg1403xxx , an enzyme specific for the
release of glcnac from the non-reducing end, gave an increase
in reducing equivalents, suggesting the enzyme action on
- xxxd2211xxx -glcnac- or -glcnac-glcnac-, resulting in the products
with glcnac at the non-reducing end, which was also supported
by the presence of glcnac along with chito-oligomers. on the
contrary, upon the addition of  xxxg1403xxx  to
the chito-oligomeric mixture derived from pronase, there was no
change in the reducing equivalents, indicating pronase action
on -glcnac- xxxd2211xxx -type linkage, which gives oligomers having
glcnac at the intermediate position or at the reducing end.
the data indicated a preference of glcnac at the non-reducing
end for chitosanolysis by pronase. in agreement with this, treatment of individual chito-oligomers (isolated using a biogel p2
column, bed volume 90 ml, elution with water) with n-acetylbeta-glucosaminidase showed no change in reducing equivalents,
whereas some of the oligomers from the papain-catalysed reaction

1.7-fold increase), in support of the fact that glcnac is at the
non-reducing ends of those oligomers. put together, the possible
monomeric sequence of the oligosaccharides could be deduced
(table 3).
table 3

compared with native chitosan, chito-oligomeric–monomeric
mixture showed better growth inhibitory effect towards both
gram-positive and -negative bacteria such as b. cereus, e. coli,
y. enterocolitica and b. licheniformis. however, for detailed study,
only strains of b. cereus f4810 (gram-positive) and e. coli
d21 (gram-negative) were selected (table 4). as the percentage
yield of chito-oligomers/monomers was dependent on reaction
time, 5 h samples containing 14 % chito-oligomers/monomers
showed better growth inhibitory activity compared with 1 and 3 h
samples, which contained 17–19 % of chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture. like lmmc [13], an increase in the concentration
of chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture did not show linear
inhibitory effect and unlike lmmc, 100 % inhibition was not
obtained at any concentration. relatively, papain-derived chitooligomeric–monomeric mixture showed better growth inhibitory
activity.

chito-oligosaccharides as bactericidal agents

figure 9 sem of b. cereus and e. coli before (a, c respectively) and after
(b, d respectively) treatment with chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture

(106 cfu · ml−1 ) and e. coli (104 cfu · ml−1 )
(a) and (b) represent chitosanolytic products of papain- and pronase-catalysed reactions
respectively.

the growth inhibitory effect of the purified mono- and chitooligomers at two different concentrations (50 and 100 µg) was
investigated (figure 8). of the two monomers used,  xxxd2211xxx 
showed 5–10 % inhibition depending on the concentration, which
was surprising, whereas glcnac did not show any such activity,
in support of the fact that the antibacterial effect of chitosan/chitooligomers is essentially due to free-nh3 + groups, which are responsible for the binding of negative charges on the bacterial cell
surface to bring about antibacterial activity [21]. a close examination of figure 8 indicates that percentage growth inhibition
by  xxxd2211xxx  and trimer obtained using both papain and pronase is
similar, which is due to their structural similarities, whereas
the other oligomers obtained using pronase showed relatively
a higher growth inhibition, probably due to their  xxxd2211xxx /glcnac
ratio. for example, the tetramer obtained using papain had  xxxd2211xxx /
glcnac ratio of 2:2, whereas that of pronase was 3:1. similarly,
between trimer and hexamer, the latter showed better growth
inhibitory effect. this explains a role played by dp and da
in the antibacterial activity of oligomers. in conclusion, it is
likely that higher the dp of oligomers rich in free  xxxd2211xxx  residues,
the higher is their growth inhibitory activity. at this point, it
has to be noted that, although the chito-oligomeric–monomeric
mixture obtained using pronase showed lesser growth inhibitory

effect compared with that of the papain-depolymerized product,
individual oligomers obtained using the former showed better
bactericidal activity and this is due to the presence of more of
glcnac residues (see the ftir subsection, table 2 and figure 6,
where da is more, presence of 6.1 % glcnac-glcnac and
release of only glcnac).
the precise mechanism of growth inhibitory activity of chitosan
is yet to be elucidated [1] and no information is available so far
on the activity of  xxxd2211xxx /glcnac and chito-oligomers of dp 2–6.
in the present study, sem data revealed pore formation and thus
permeabilization of the cytoplasmic contents of b. cereus, and
irregularities on the cell surface of e. coli, after treatment with
chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture (figure 9), indicating their
different action patterns. when the b. cereus culture suspended
in saline was treated (24 h at 37 ◦c) with chito-oligomeric–
monomeric mixture, followed by analyses of carbohydrate and
protein contents in the cell-free supernatant, there was 25–30-fold
increase compared with control culture supernatants, confirming
permeabilizing action of the test samples. however, similar results
were not obtained with e. coli in the initial hours, although, after
approx. 72 h of incubation, a slight increase in the carbohydrate–
protein content was observed. to confirm this, both b. cereus and
e. coli were suspended in saline and divided into three parts,
and the first part was subjected to sonication, the second part was
taken as control and the third was treated with chito-oligomeric–
monomeric mixture. after approx. 20 h of incubation, all the
three were centrifuged (1000 g and 15 min), and the supernatants
were dialysed to remove the saline, concentrated and subjected to
native page [27]. as depicted in figure 10, sonicated samples
showed the presence of proteins, whereas the control samples did not. similar to sonicated samples, the chito-oligomeric–
monomeric mixture-treated b. cereus showed the presence of
protein, whereas that of e. coli did not show any protein, in
support of permeabilization of the cytoplasmic contents of the
former. furthermore, the identification of cytoplasmic enzymes
such as  xxxg1401xxx , lactase and protease in the cell-free supernatants
of sonicated and chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture-treated
b. cereus supported spillage of cytoplasmic contents. the
amino acid sequence of the protein separated on native page
(electrophoretic mobility, rf = 0.15) from b. cereus was found

put together, the results confirmed chito-oligomeric–monomeric
mixture to be bactericidal in nature.

figure 11

based on the above data, the following mechanism could be
proposed for bactericidal action of chito-oligomeric–monomeric
mixture.
the mode of action of cationic antibacterial agents is widely
believed to be due to interacting with and disrupting the wall/
membrane structure [28]. in gram-positive bacteria (figure 11),
the cell membrane is covered by a cell wall made up of 30–
40 layers of peptidoglycans, which contain glcnac, n-acetylmuramic acid as well as d- and l-amino acids including isoglutamate and teichoic acid [29], to which the positively charged
amino groups of chito-oligomers/ xxxd2211xxx  can bind, resulting in

mechanism of bactericidal action of chito-oligomeric–monomeric mixture towards b. cereus and e. coli : a hypothetical model

chito-oligosaccharides as bactericidal agents

cell-wall distortion–disruption, exposure of cell membrane to
osmotic shock and exudation of the cytoplasmic contents.
gram-negative bacteria, on the other hand, contain an outer
membrane wherein lipopolysaccharide and proteins are held
together by electrostatic interactions with bivalent metal ions, one
to two layers of peptidoglycans (cell wall) and a cell membrane
(containing lipid bilayer, transmembrane proteins and inner/outer
membrane proteins). the negatively charged o-specific antigenic
oligosaccharide-repeating units of the e. coli lipopolysaccharide
form ionic-type of binding with the amino groups of chito-oligomers (which are cationic in nature below ph 6.2), thus blocking
the nutrient flow with concomitant bacterial death due to depletion of the nutrients (figure 11). here, the deposition of cationic
oligomers on to the cell surface is more prominent than membrane
disruption as in the case of gram-positive bacteria, owing to
stronger association of o-chains to the outer membrane structure.
the smaller molecular mass of the chito-oligomers/ xxxd2211xxx  and
more electronegativity on gram-negative bacteria facilitate effective binding and aggregation of the former, blocking the
nutrient flow and ultimately leading to cell lysis.
the papain-derived chito-oligomers with glcnac at the nonreducing ends (as determined using  xxxg1403xxx )
did show bacterial growth inhibitory activities, indicating a role
not played by terminal  xxxd2211xxx /glcnac residues. in fact, as shown
in figure 10, oligomeric chain-linked  xxxd2211xxx , through their free
–nh3 + groups, could interact with the bacterial cell surface,
resulting in bactericidal activity.
in conclusion, the use of papain and pronase for chitosanolysis
as a substitute for expensive unavailable chitosanase could be
exploited commercially, for they result in the production of chitooligomers and monomers along with lmmc, which are of considerable biomedical importance. association of bactericidal activity with the chito-oligomers is of value in their utilization as
a natural food additive and food preservative, since they are
biocompatible, non-toxic, water-soluble and consumption safe.
these results demonstrate value addition to chitosan, which is
otherwise a waste material found in the offal of marine food
processing industry, and also the use of low-cost and easily
available enzymes such as papain and pronase for better biofunctionalities.
