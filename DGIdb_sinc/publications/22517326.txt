analogous complex between yfia and the eco
ribosome (11), as well as with 8.5 å resolution
cryo-em density map of a similar complex between chloroplast-specific yfia homolog, psrp1,
bound to the eco ribosome (12). in our model,
hpf and yfia are bound in the channel that lies
between the head and the body of the 30s subunit
where trnas and mrna bind during protein synthesis (fig. 4, e and f). although the globular domains of hpf and yfia have overlapping binding
sites, hpf stabilizes the 100s ribosome dimer,
whereas yfia inhibits its formation (6). the inhibition is due to the extended c-terminal tail of yfia,
which hpf does not have, that blocks the binding of rmf and, thus, the rmf-induced dimer
formation. the visible portion of the yfia tail follows the mrna channel, whereas the c-terminal
end of the tail, which presumably projects into the
rmf binding site (fig. 4d), could not be modeled.
this observation is consistent with previous biochemical studies suggesting mutually exclusive
binding of yfia and rmf to the 70s ribosome (5).
additionally, yfia also prevents the formation of
the 100s dimer by stabilizing the head domain
of the small subunit in its apo-conformation.
our structures reveal that rmf and hpf
can bind simultaneously and function together
to interfere with the initiation of protein synthesis, which is consistent with the biochemical data
(5). the hpf-yfia binding site not only overlaps with all of the trna binding sites (fig. 4,
e and f) but also with the binding sites of the
initiation factors if1 and if3 (fig. s6, a and b),
which are directly involved in dissociation of
the ribosomes into subunits (21), and elongation
factor g (fig. s6, c and d), which assists ribosome recycling factor in dissociating posttermination complexes of 70s ribosomes (22). the
inability of these factors to perform their func-

tion as a result of blocking by hpf or yfia of
their binding sites explains the reduced dissociation of the stationary-phase ribosomes into subunits (10). because rmf, hpf, and yfia bind
exclusively to the 30s subunit, they might not
only interfere with initiation of protein synthesis
starting on the 70s ribosomes, as in the case of
leaderless mrna (23) or during reinitiation along
polycistronic mrnas (24) but also with canonical initiation starting on the 30s subunits.
these studies show that these stationary-phase
proteins, when bound to the ribosome, sterically
clash with mrna and trnas, and therefore, they
cannot act on actively translating ribosomes. this
ensures that the stationary-phase factors function
only after the completion of the ongoing translation cycles and can only act effectively during
stress and/or starvation conditions when the availability of the mrna and/or trnas is limiting.

which shows promise for treatment of insulin
resistance and type 2 diabetes (4, 5). aspirin and
salicylate inhibit cyclo-oxygenases and, hence,
prostanoid biosynthesis (6), as well as the protein kinase ikb kinase b ( xxxg1159xxx ) in the  xxxg1559xxx 
pathway (7). however, some effects of these
drugs are still observed in mice deficient in
these pathways (8).
 xxxd81xxx –activated protein
kinase ( xxxg1830xxx ) is a cellular energy sensor con-

salicylate, a plant product, has been in medicinal use since ancient times. more recently, it has
been replaced by synthetic derivatives such as aspirin and  xxxd3163xxx , both of which are rapidly broken
down to salicylate in vivo. at concentrations reached in plasma after administration of  xxxd3163xxx  or
of aspirin at high doses, salicylate activates  xxxd81xxx –activated protein kinase
( xxxg1830xxx ), a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism. salicylate binds at the same site as the
synthetic activator a-769662 to cause allosteric activation and inhibition of dephosphorylation of the
activating phosphorylation site, threonine-172. in  xxxg1830xxx  knockout mice, effects of salicylate to increase
fat utilization and to lower plasma  xxxd2154xxx  in vivo were lost. our results suggest that  xxxg1830xxx 
activation could explain some beneficial effects of  xxxd3163xxx  and aspirin in humans.

served throughout eukaryotes. this heterotrimeric
enzyme is composed of catalytic a subunits
and regulatory b and g subunits (9, 10). once
activated in response to metabolic stress,  xxxg1830xxx 
phosphorylates targets that switch off adenosine
triphosphate (atp)–consuming processes while
switching on catabolic pathways that generate
atp.  xxxg1830xxx  is activated >100-fold by phosphorylation at thr172 in the  xxxg220xxx  by the tumor suppressor protein kinase,  xxxg2218xxx , or the ca2+-dependent
kinase, camkkb (calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-b) (9, 10). binding of amp or  xxxd80xxx  (adp) to the g subunit triggers
a conformational change that promotes phosphorylation and inhibits dephosphorylation (11–15),
causing a switch to the active form. binding
of amp (but not adp) to a second site (15)
causes further allosteric activation, leading to
>1000-fold activation overall (16). most drugs or
xenobiotics that activate  xxxg1830xxx  work by inhibiting mitochondrial atp synthesis and increasing the concentration of amp and adp
(17). however, a synthetic activator, a-769662
(18), which also causes allosteric activation and
inhibits thr172 dephosphorylation, binds directly
to  xxxg1830xxx  at sites distinct from those used by
amp (19–21).

salicylate, but not aspirin, activated  xxxg1830xxx 
when applied to human embryonic kidney
(hek) 293 cells, with its effects being significant
at 1 mm and above (fig. 1a; it appears that the
esterases that catalyze breakdown of aspirin to
salicylate are not expressed in these cells). this
was associated with increased phosphorylation of
thr172 on  xxxg1830xxx -a and the downstream target of
 xxxg1830xxx , acetyl– xxxd1739xxx  carboxylase (acc);
in the latter case, the effects were evident at
1 mm and above (fig. 1a). salicylate can uncouple mitochondrial respiration (22), so we suspected that it might activate  xxxg1830xxx  by decreasing
cellular atp and increasing amp and adp.
to test this, we used isogenic cell lines expressing wild-type  xxxg1830xxx  (wt cells) or a
mutated enzyme in which an arg531→gly531
(r531g) substitution in g2 renders  xxxg1830xxx  insensitive to amp or adp (rg cells) (see supplemental materials and methods) (15, 17). at
concentrations <10 mm, salicylate caused similar
increases in  xxxg1830xxx  phosphorylation or activation in wt and rg cells, showing that the effect
was not dependent on changes in amp or adp.
however,  xxxd1891xxx  mm and above, there was a
greater activation/phosphorylation in wt than
in rg cells, suggesting that amp- or adp-

dependent effects were also occurring at these
higher concentrations (fig. 1b). concentrations
>1 mm salicylate increased cellular oxygen uptake in both wt and rg cells. this effect was
not additive with the effect of a concentration
of dinitrophenol causing a maximal increase in
oxygen uptake, suggesting that at these concentrations, salicylate, like dinitrophenol, could
dissipate the proton gradient and thus uncouple
the respiratory chain from atp synthesis (fig.
1c). however, unlike effects of another  xxxg1830xxx 
activator (h2o2), any increases in the cellular
adp:atp ratio at salicylate concentrations below 30 mm were very small (fig. 1d). thus,
mitochondria appear to compensate for mild
uncoupling by increasing respiration. salicylate
does not activate  xxxg1830xxx  through the ca2+camkkb pathway (12), because the camkk
inhibitor sto-609 had no effect on responses to
salicylate, although it blocked responses to a ca2+
ionophore, a23187 (fig. s1, a and b, supplementary data).
using a physiological concentration of atp
in assays (2 mm), salicylate caused a 1.6-fold allosteric activation with a half-maximal effect (a0.5)
at 1.0 t 0.2 mm (fig. 2a). we observed a large
activation by amp at all salicylate concentrations

up to 30 mm (fig. 2b), and salicylate did not
affect the concentration of amp causing halfmaximal activation (a0.5 = 18 t 3 or 13 t 2 mm,
with or without 10 mm salicylate) (fig. 2c). in
contrast, increasing concentrations of salicylate
progressively antagonized activation by 30 and
100 nm a-769662 (fig. 2d), and 10 mm salicylate increased a0.5 for a-769662 by >fourfold
(from 39 t 4 to 172 t 24 nm) (fig. 2e). these
results suggest that salicylate is a partial agonist
acting at the same site as a-769662, causing a
small activation on its own but antagonizing
the larger activation by a-769662. if it binds at
the same site, salicylate should protect against
thr172 dephosphorylation, as does a-769662
(19, 20). indeed, salicylate protected  xxxg1830xxx  (human a1b1g1 complex) against dephosphorylation and inactivation by protein phosphatase-2ca
to the same extent as did amp and a-769662
(fig. 2f), although it had no effect on  xxxg1817xxx 
assayed using a peptide substrate (fig. s2). a
ser108→ala108 (s108a) substitution in the

b1 subunit abolishes effects of a-769662 on
dephosphorylation, and b2-containing complexes are resistant to the drug (20, 21). as
expected, an s108a substitution in the a1b1g1
complex abolished the effects of a-769662
and salicylate, but not that of amp (fig. 2g),
whereas there was no effect of salicylate on
dephosphorylation of an a1b2g1 complex, although there was a small effect of a-769662
(fig. 2h). these results lend further support to
the idea that salicylate binds at the same site(s)
as a-769662.
to examine effects of salicylate on  xxxg1830xxx 
phosphorylation and activation in intact cells, we
used hek-293 cells carrying a flp recombinase
target site to generate isogenic lines expressing
flag-tagged wt b1, a b1-s108a mutant, or
wt b2. with the use of an antibody that recognizes both isoforms, endogenous b1 and b2
could be detected in the parental cells, but, as observed previously when expressing a subunits
using this system (17), these were largely replaced

and salicylate caused increased activation/
phosphorylation of  xxxg1830xxx  in cells expressing
wt b1 (fig. 3b), but their effects were greatly
reduced in cells expressing the b1-s108a

we used b1 knockout (ko) mice to test
whether salicylate has metabolic effects in vivo
through  xxxg1830xxx  (23). fatty-acid oxidation in isolated wt hepatocytes was stimulated by salicylate
or a-769662 and was associated with increased
phosphorylation of  xxxg1830xxx  and acc [the latter
regulating fat oxidation (24)]. all effects were reduced or eliminated in hepatocytes from b1-kos
(fig. 3, e and f, and fig. s3). there were no
changes in adp:atp ratios in wt cells in response to 1 to 10 mm salicylate (fig. s4a).

reports
we injected mice with salicylate or a-769662
at the start of a period of fasting to assess
metabolism in vivo. the dose that we used
generated plasma salicylate of 2.4 t 0.4 and 2.0 t
0.1 mm (mean t sem, n = 7 and 3 mice) in wt
and b1-ko mice, respectively. both agents caused
phosphorylation of liver  xxxg1830xxx  and acc in wt
but not b1-ko mice (fig. 4, a and b), although
there were no changes in hepatic amp:atp or
adp:atp ratios in wt mice (fig. s4b). in wt
mice, salicylate also caused phosphorylation and
activation of  xxxg1830xxx  in soleus muscle and adipose tissue (fig. s5). both agents depressed the
respiratory exchange ratio (rer) for 6 hours after injection, consistent with a switch from carbohydrate to fat utilization; these effects were
lost in b1-kos (fig. 4, c to f). significant depressions in rer, in wt mice only, were evident
by calculating the area under the curve (fig. s6, a
and b). when we calculated fat and carbohydrate utilization, both salicylate and a-769662
increased fat utilization in wt but not b1-ko
mice (fig. 4g); a-769662 also decreased carbohydrate utilization in wt mice (fig. s6, c and d).
both salicylate and a-769662 reduced serum
nonesterified  xxxd2154xxx  in wt but not b1-ko
mice (fig. 4h). we also studied glucose homeostasis in mice made insulin-resistant by highfat feeding, followed by daily salicylate injections
for 2 weeks. however, effects of salicylate to
improve fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) were retained in b1-ko mice
(fig. s7), indicating that they were independent
of  xxxg1830xxx .
our results show that salicylate can directly
activate  xxxg1830xxx , primarily by inhibiting thr172
dephosphorylation. the plasma salicylate concentrations in humans treated with oral  xxxd3163xxx 
(4) or high-dose aspirin (30 to 90 mg/kg) (25, 26)
are 1 to 3 mm. at these concentrations, salicylate activated  xxxg1830xxx  in wt and rg hek-293
cells to the same extent and did not increase
cellular adp:atp ratios, indicating an ampindependent mechanism. thus, the natural product
salicylate can activate  xxxg1830xxx  via a mechanism
closely related to that of a-769662, a synthetic
activator derived from a high-throughput screen
[which, unlike salicylates, has poor oral availability (18)]. although the exact site(s) occupied
by salicylate and a-769662 on  xxxg1830xxx  remain
unidentified, our finding that the s108a mutation
abolishes activation by both agents suggests that
the binding sites overlap.
effects of salicylate on fat oxidation in vivo
appear to require activation of  xxxg1830xxx -b1 complexes. aspirin also reduces circulating lipids
in obese rats and improves insulin sensitivity
(7). however, in agreement with previous studies
(7, 27), our results using long-term salicylate treatment of fat-fed mice (fig. s7) indicate that effects
on  xxxg1830xxx -independent pathways, such as  xxxg1159xxx 
or c- xxxg1370xxx , are also important.
after oral administration, aspirin is rapidly
broken down by liver, erythrocyte, and plasma

922

esterases to salicylate (3), whose peak plasma
concentrations and half-life are orders of magnitude greater than those of aspirin (2). our
findings raise the possibility that other effects of
aspirin, like protective effects against development of cancer (28), may be mediated in part by
 xxxg1830xxx .  xxxg1830xxx  is activated by the antidiabetic
drug metformin (17, 29), and treatment of diabetics with metformin is also associated with
reduced cancer incidence (30). our results show
that one thing salicylates and metformin have in
common is their ability to activate  xxxg1830xxx . however, one caveat is that the doses of aspirin required to activate  xxxg1830xxx  in vivo may be higher
than those used in most human studies.

being reviewed, din et al. [f. v. n. din et al.,

colorectal cancer cell lines.

aerobic microbial respiration in
86-million-year-old deep-sea red clay

microbial communities can subsist at depth in marine sediments without fresh supply of organic
matter for millions of years. at threshold sedimentation rates of 1 millimeter per 1000 years,
the low rates of microbial community metabolism in the north pacific gyre allow sediments to
remain oxygenated tens of meters below the sea floor. we found that the oxygen respiration rates
dropped from 10 micromoles of o2 liter−1 year−1 near the sediment-water interface to 0.001
micromoles of o2 liter−1 year−1 at 30-meter depth within 86 million-year-old sediment. the
cell-specific respiration rate decreased with depth but stabilized at around 10−3 femtomoles of
o2 cell−1 day−1 10 meters below the seafloor. this result indicated that the community size is
controlled by the rate of carbon oxidation and thereby by the low available energy flux.
he discovery of living microbial communities in deeply buried marine sediments
(1, 2) has spurred interest in life under
extreme energy limitation (3). the subtropical

ters of the gyres is low, yet within the same order of magnitude as the surrounding open ocean
(fig. 1). oxygen penetrates many meters into
the seabed below the gyres, which indicates extremely low rates of microbial community respiration (4, 5) in contrast to the rest of the seabed
