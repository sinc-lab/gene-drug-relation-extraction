interleukin (il)–1 family members are key players in inflammatory processes but have been the subject of
few studies of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). to better evaluate the impact of the il-1 family
on aids development, we genotyped the  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx  genes in 245 slow progressor (sp) and
82 rapid progressor (rp) human immunodeficiency virus type 1–seropositive patients as well as in 446 control
subjects, all of whom were of white ethnicity. one hundred sixteen frequent polymorphisms were identified,
of which 23 were newly characterized by our study. many putative associations were found between singlenucleotide polymorphism (snp) or haplotype alleles and the extreme profiles of progression. most of them
corresponded to weak associations (.01 ! p ! .05 ); however, the snp il1ra_2134 exhibited a consistent association, found at the level of the snp, haplotypes, and haploblocks, when the sp and control populations
were compared (p p .0002). the il-1–dependent inflammatory response is, thus, likely to play a role in aids
progression via the regulation of  xxxg1172xxx  expression. this association will need to be confirmed in other aids
cohorts, and experiments will also have to be performed to unravel the biological mechanisms at work. the
data presented here will be useful for future genomic studies of the il-1 family members in other infectious
and chronic inflammatory diseases.
interleukin (il)–1 is a key player in inflammatory responses and can induce various effects that range from
fever induction to the increase of the lymphocyte response [1–3]. the term “il-1” usually designates a
group of 3 molecules; 2 of them,  xxxg1169xxx  and il-1b, are
biologically active, and the third member,  xxxg1172xxx , is a
receptor antagonist whose function is to moderate the
effects of  xxxg1169xxx  and il-1b [4, 5].

the role played by cytokines in the development of
hiv-1 infection has been extensively investigated [6,
7], but relatively few studies have dealt with the members of the il-1 family. this is surprising, in light of
the importance of il-1 in inflammation and in the
response to infectious diseases, but it is understandable,
given that aids is mainly known as a disease of adaptive immunity [8]. the balance between  xxxg1169xxx /b and
 xxxg1172xxx  has been reported to modulate hiv-1 expression in monocytes [9, 10]— xxxg1172xxx  has been shown to
reduce hiv-1 levels in monocytes, whereas  xxxg1169xxx /b
have been shown to induce hiv-1 expression [11, 12].
similarly, antiretroviral therapy (art) caused a reduction of  xxxg1169xxx /b levels and an increase of  xxxg1172xxx  levels
in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated hiv-1–infected monocytes [13]. other studies have pointed out interactions
such as an activation of il-1b production in neuroblastoma cells in vitro by the gp120 protein of hiv-1

subjects, materials, and methods
the griv cohort. the griv cohort was established in 1995
in france to generate a large collection of dna for genetic
studies of candidate polymorphisms associated with rapid and
slow progression to aids. only white individuals of european
descent living in france were recruited. these criteria limit the
influence of the virogenetic and environmental factors (all subjects are infected by b strains and live in a similar environment)
and puts emphasis on the genetic makeup of each individual
to determine the various patterns of progression. sp patients

were defined as individuals who had been seropositive but
asymptomatic for 8 or more years with a cd4+ cell count 1500
cells/mm3 in the absence of art. rp patients were defined as
those who had a decrease in their cd4+ cell count to !300
cells/mm3 in !3 years after the last seronegative test. dna was
obtained from fresh peripheral-blood mononuclear cells or from
epstein-barr virus–transformed cell lines. the control subjects
were seronegative white individuals of european descent living
in france. in the present study, we genotyped up to 245 sp
patients, 82 rp patients, and 446 control subjects.
genotyping. the primers and conditions used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the different fragments
are shown in table 2. sequencing reactions were performed by
the dye terminator method, using an abi prism 3700 dna
analyzer (applied biosystems). alignment, snp discovery,
and genotyping were done with the software genalys (version
3.3.24a), developed by the centre national de génotypage [34].
for practical reasons, an initial screening was performed on
150 sp patients, 50 rp patients, and 150 control subjects for
polymorphism discovery. the screening was then extended to
include more subjects when a positive (p ⭐ .05 ) or borderline
(p ! .1) association was detected.
hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe). hwe analysis was
performed for each snp in each group according to the standard method: the experimental genotypic distribution was compared with the theoretical distribution estimated on the basis
of the snp allelic frequencies, and a p value could thus be
derived. it is important to assess the deviations from hwe
(p ! .05), because it suggests an effect of the snp if a deviation
is observed in a case group, and it suggests a mistake in the
genotyping otherwise [35, 36].
haplotypes. haplotype estimates were obtained using the
expectation-maximization (em) algorithm [37] and the phase
2 algorithm [38, 39] either for all polymorphisms or for selected
ones.
linkage disequilibrium and haploblocks. linkage disequilibrium was computed for each pair of polymorphisms by
the standard r 2 method [40] or the standard d  method [41].
a haploblock is a genetic region for which no evidence of a
historical recombination event can be found—in other words,
the snps located in that region exhibit a significant level of
linkage disequilibrium (d  close to 1). the haploblocks in the
genes were computed using the method developed by gabriel
et al. [42], which is used by the software haploview (version
3.2; available at: http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/)
[43]. the haplotype tagging (ht) polymorphisms are the polymorphisms that are sufficient to describe the genetic variation
inside a haploblock. these ht polymorphisms were also computed using haploview and served as a basis for the estimation
of subhaplotypes in the computed haploblocks.
statistical analyses. statistical analyses were performed only

envelope [14] and an inhibition of  xxxg1169xxx  expression in vitro
by the viral protein tat [15]. furthermore, it has been showed
that caspase-mediated il-1b processing can play a major role
in cd4+ t cell survival and hiv-1 proliferation [16].
only few genetic association studies regarding the impact of
il-1 family members on aids have been conducted to date—
the first study showed that a tandem-repeat polymorphism in
the il1ra gene was associated with reduced hiv-1 levels [17],
another study linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps)
in  xxxg1169xxx  with the control of hiv viremia in patients receiving
highly active art (haart) [18], and a third study investigating a few polymorphisms in  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx 
found no association with aids progression [19].
our group previously completed the exhaustive genotyping
of th1/th2 cytokines and their receptor genes [20, 21] and
looked for associations with aids progression in the genetics
of resistance to immunodeficiency virus (griv) cohort. as a
continuation of this previous work and to clarify the role played
by il-1 family members in aids, we present here the extensive
genotyping of the  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx  genes and their
associations with aids progression in the griv cohort, which
is composed of 2 subpopulations of hiv-1–seropositive white
individuals with extreme progression phenotypes and living in
france: slow-progressor (sp) patients and rapid-progressor (rp)
patients. we also genotyped healthy control subjects of similar
ethnic origin. the griv patients correspond to the extreme
1% subset of a cohort of 30,000 seroconverter patients [22]
and is, as far as we know, the largest cohort of its kind in the
world. its quality has already been confirmed for several gene
polymorphisms, such as ccr5 [23–25] and hla [26, 27].
the  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx  genes are located in the
2q12–2q14 region of chromosome 2.  xxxg1169xxx  and  xxxg1170xxx  are spaced
by 40 kb, il1ra is 280 kb telomeric from  xxxg1170xxx , and  xxxg1171xxx  is
11 mb centromeric from  xxxg1169xxx  (figure 1a).  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , and
il1ra likely derive from the same ancestral gene [2, 3]. in the
present study, snps and other genetic variations of the il-1
family members were identified through sequencing. the data
gathered were used to compute the genetic structure of the  xxxg1169xxx  family locus (linkage disequilibrium and haploblocks) and to
evaluate associations with aids susceptibility and development.

snp discovery. we systematically screened the  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx ,
il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx  genes for polymorphisms by sequencing the
exons with their flanking regions as well as the promoter region.
we identified 116 frequent polymorphisms (minor allele frequency 11% in our entire population) in these genes, most of
them being snps (figure 1b). of these 116 polymorphisms, 27
were in the  xxxg1169xxx  gene, 10 were in the  xxxg1170xxx  gene, 35 were in
the il1ra gene, and 44 were in the  xxxg1171xxx  gene (figure 1b); 22
of these 116 polymorphisms were newly characterized in our
study. on average, we found 1 polymorphism with a frequency

findings of previous studies [44, 45]. the allelic frequencies
obtained in our study were compared with the data from the
national center for biotechnology information’s dbsnp database (available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) when
the allelic frequencies were available for the european population. our results are consistent with dbsnp allelic frequencies
except for the snps il1a_3769, il1b_289, and il1r1_–16069,
whose allelic frequencies exhibit differences 110%, compared
with those in dbsnp.
il-1 family gene structure. the 4 genes  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , il1ra,
and  xxxg1171xxx  are neighbors in the same chromosomal region (figure 1a).  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , and il1ra are very close to each other
(!300 kb) and, thus, were investigated for linkage disequilibrium between their polymorphisms by use of the software haploview [43]. as shown in figure 2a,  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , and il1ra
present strong intragenic linkage disequilibrium (195%), but
there is no intergenic linkage disequilibrium between them even
though these genes lie relatively close to each other on the
chromosome. figure 2b–2e presents the haploblocks for each
gene, which correspond to groups of polymorphisms that have
never undergone any recombination; we found 1 haploblock
for the gene  xxxg1169xxx , 2 for  xxxg1170xxx , 3 for il1ra, and 3 for  xxxg1171xxx .
as shown in table 4, all the snps fitted with hardy-weinberg

(sp and rp patients) and the control subjects. table 1 presents
the allelic frequencies in each population, their locations, and
p values (the abridged version of the table that appears in the

on the polymorphisms (and haplotypes) with a minor allele
frequency 11% in our entire population, termed “frequent
polymorphisms.” the differences in the allelic distributions
(snps or haplotypes) between the 3 populations were examined
as follows: for each allele (with a frequency 11% in the entire
population), the expected numbers of individuals in each population with and without that allele were compared by a fisher’s
exact test. four modes of calculation were used for the genetic
analysis: allelic frequency, dominant mode, recessive mode, and
genotypic distribution. for snps, there are only 2 alleles, and
the p value for the dominant mode on one allele is identical
to the p value for the recessive mode on the other allele. as a
consequence, table 1, which concerns individual polymorphisms, combines the dominant and recessive modes. bonferroni corrections were not performed because, in such candidate-gene association studies, confirmation in other cohorts is
more relevant [22].

in the  xxxg1169xxx  gene, no polymorphism exhibited any positive
association, but the snp il1a_–472 exhibited a borderline association (table 1). in the  xxxg1170xxx  gene, no polymorphism exhibited any positive or borderline association. in the il1ra gene,
2 snps exhibited positive associations (table 1). the lowest p
value was obtained for the intronic snp il1ra_2134 (p p
.0002 in the dominant/recessive mode) for the comparison between the sp population and the control population (table 1).
in the  xxxg1171xxx  gene, 8 polymorphisms exhibited positive associations (table 1). two were located in the promoter region, 5
were located in introns, and one was located in the 3 untranslated region. the promoter snps did not correspond to known
transcription factor binding sites. the lowest p value was obtained for il1r1_–131, located in intron 1 (p p .010 in the
dominant/recessive and genotypic distribution modes) for
the comparison between the sp population and the control
population.
of note, of the 10 polymorphisms exhibiting positive associations, only il1ra_2134 remained significant for the simultaneous comparison of the 3 populations by the x2 test (table
1). this confirms that comparing the populations 2 ⫻ 2 is more
sensitive [21].
associations with aids progression: haplotypes. for each
gene, the haplotypes were estimated using the phase 2 and em
algorithms for the polymorphisms with a minor allelic frequency 15% and for the promoter polymorphisms as well. the
haplotypes based on the nonsynonymous snps (protein variants) were not estimated, because each gene contained no more
than 1 nonsynonymous snp. table 5 presents the haplotype
data; the estimated haplotypes exhibiting a positive (p ⭐ .05)
or borderline (p ! .1) association for comparisons between the
populations are shown in the abridged version of the table given
in the print edition of the journal, and the detailed composition
of all haplotypes is shown in the complete version of the table
given in the electronic edition of the journal.
for the  xxxg1169xxx  gene, we identified positive associations for the
haplotype il1a_over5%_3 (p p .013 in the dominant mode)
for the comparison between the sp population and the control
population. for the  xxxg1170xxx  gene, we identified positive associations for il1b_over5%_0 (p p .026 in the recessive mode) and
il1b_over5%_1 (p p .048 in the dominant mode) for the
comparison between the sp population and the control population. for the il1ra gene, we identified positive associations for 3 haplotypes. the lowest p value was found for

il1ra_over5%_0 (p p .0002 in the dominant mode) for the
comparison between the sp population and the control population. the association for this haplotype can be entirely explained by the snp il1ra_2134. no positive association was
identified for the haplotypes of  xxxg1171xxx , and no positive association was identified for the haplotypes based on the polymorphisms located in the promoter regions of the genes (data
not shown).
we have presented here the results based on snps with a
minor allelic frequency 15%, to clarify the presentation. we
have also performed the haplotype analysis with all the polymorphisms found in each gene, and the results that we obtained
were identical (data not shown).
haploblocks. haploblocks are presented in figure 2. ht
snps were computed for the haploblocks il1a_block1,
il1b_block2, il1ra_block1, il1r1_block1, and il1r1_block3.
the other haploblocks were only composed of 2 polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium and, thus, did not present any
interest for this calculation. we computed the haplotypes
(which we have termed “ht haplotypes”) derived from these
ht snps and tested them for associations with aids progression (table 6). no positive association was found for the
ht haplotypes of  xxxg1169xxx  or  xxxg1171xxx , but some of them presented
borderline associations (table 6). for  xxxg1170xxx , the ht haplotypes
h0 and h2 of the main haploblock presented positive associations for the comparison between the sp populations and
the control population table 6: these ht haplotypes were subhaplotypes of the larger haplotypes that were derived from all
the snps and that exhibited a positive association (table 5).
the second haploblock of  xxxg1170xxx  is minor, because it contains
only the 2 polymorphisms il1b_–1061 and il1b_–581, which
were in linkage disequilibrium. for il1ra, the ht haplotype
il1ra_h0 presented a positive association (p p .0001 in the
allelic frequency mode and p p .00002 in the dominant mode)
for the comparison between the sp population and the control
population (table 6). a positive association was also obtained
when the 3 populations were compared for this haplotype
(p p .0005). il1ra_h0 was the only subhaplotype that presented the allele g for the snp il1ra_2134. furthermore,
il1ra_h0 is a subhaplotype of il1ra_over5%_0, which also
exhibited a positive association (table 5) and is linked to the
snp il1ra_2134. thus, the association with aids progression
for the ht haplotype il1ra_h0 is likely due to the effect of
the snp il1ra_2134. the ht haplotype il1ra_h1 also presented a positive association (p p .025 ) in the recessive mode

discussion
we undertook the exhaustive genotyping of the  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx ,
il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx  genes to look for genetic factors involved in
aids progression. the interest in such a study is to provide
clues to the molecular mechanisms of disease development and
help for the rational design of new diagnostic or therapeutic
targets.
of 116 frequent polymorphisms detected in the il-1 family
genes, 22 were newly characterized in our study. we identified
10 polymorphisms exhibiting positive associations (p ⭐ .05)
and 6 other polymorphisms exhibiting borderline associations
(p ! .1) with aids progression (table 1). we identified 6 haplotypes exhibiting positive associations (table 5). these positive
associations were found by comparing the sp population with
the control population or the rp population with the control

population, which was the basis of the present case-control
study. it is noteworthy that comparison of the rp, sp, and
control populations simultaneously appears to be less sensitive,
given that only 1 association of 10 remained positive for the
polymorphisms and 2 of 6 remained positive for the haplotypes.
almost all polymorphisms involved in an association were
located in introns, and their biological effect is, thus, difficult
to interpret. only 3 snps exhibiting a positive association were
located in a promoter region, all in the promoter region of
 xxxg1171xxx  (table 1). two of these snps were in full linkage disequilibrium, and they belonged to the same haploblock. the

of  xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx .

edition of the journal of infectious diseases.

sociations in our study. the snps il1b_⫺1061, il1b_⫺581,
il1b_3417, il1a_⫺1613, il1a_4125, and il1ra_2006 have
been associated with other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis [30], osteoarthritis [53–55], periodontal disease [52],
asthma [56, 57], allergic rhinitis [58], and lupus [59]. none of
these snps presented a positive association in our study.
in the present study, we thoroughly investigated the genes
of the il-1 family ( xxxg1169xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx , il1ra, and  xxxg1171xxx ), providing
an important set of information. we identified new polymorphisms in these genes and also found putative associations between some polymorphisms, haplotypes, and haploblocks of
these genes with aids progression. of all the associations, one
appears to be strongest, pointing to an intronic snp in il1ra;
this snp definitely deserves more extensive analyses, either by
genetic association investigations in other aids cohorts or by
further biological experimentation to assess its impact on il1ra expression. another interesting methodological observation, which confirms the observation made in our previous
work [21], is that use of the 2 ⫻ 2 case-control comparisons is
more sensitive for the detection of associations. on the other
hand, it appears more robust to compare simultaneously the
3 populations.
cytokine receptors are an assembly of 2 or more subunits,
which are all required for efficient ligand binding and signal
transduction. the  xxxg220xxx  il-1r1 studied here is involved
in both ligand binding and intracellular signaling, but the b
subunit il-1racp (accessory protein) is required for efficient
signal transmission [5]. there is another receptor in this family,
il-1r2, which preferentially binds to il-1b. its intracellular
domain is very short, and it apparently fails to initiate any biological response [60]. it is believed to act as a natural moderator
for il-1. our work will, thus, need to be completed by the
analysis of these last 2 members of the il-1 family.
the important amount of data provided and the putative
associations discovered in this work will be useful for future
genetic association studies of the role il-1 family members play
in hiv-1 infection. given the importance of il-1 in the inflammatory process, this information should also prove to be
useful for the study of other infectious and chronic inflammatory diseases.

haplotypes derived from these promoter snps did not exhibit
any positive or borderline associations (data not shown). the
biological effect of the promoter snps on il-1r1 expression
is at present unknown, and we did not find any similarity with
previously described transcription factor binding sites. thus, it
will be of interest to perform reporter gene experiments or
competitive gel shift assays, to determine whether the alleles of
these snps can have a differential effect on gene expression.
most of the associations for the individual polymorphisms
were rather weak, with p values between .01 and .05, except
for the intronic snp il1ra_2134 (p p .0002, in the dominant/
recessive mode) for the comparison between the sp population
and the control population. similarly, most of the associations
found for haplotypes and ht haplotypes were weak (.01 !
p ! .05), except for the ones linked with the snp il1ra_2134
(table 5). we also evaluated whether sex, age, or route of infection could influence these results; there was no such influence (data not shown).
the allele il1ra_2134g was carried by 32.12%, 44.62%, and
53.06% of the control, rp, and sp populations, respectively.
because the p value comparing the rp and control populations
was also low for this allele (p p .08), there was a possibility
that this snp could be associated with susceptibility to hiv-1
infection rather than with disease progression; we thus analyzed
180 seropositive subjects from the seroco cohort [46] and
found that the distribution of the alleles for this snp was identical to that of the control population (data not shown). the
effect of il1ra_2134 is, thus, mainly associated with slow disease progression. this snp is located next to a well-known
variable-number tandem repeat of il1ra (located in the same
intron) that has been associated with many diseases [4, 47],
including aids [17]. this repeat is composed most often by
two or by four 86-bp units, but it could not be genotyped in
the present study because of technical reasons. there have been
contradictory reports of the il1ra*2 allele (2-u repeat) being
associated with higher [48, 49] or lower [50] levels of  xxxg1172xxx .
the association found for the il1ra_2134 snp emphasizes the
importance of this intronic region, and experiments will have
to be performed to determine whether the effect is mediated
solely through this snp or through linkage disequilibrium with
this variable-number tandem repeat.
besides the study of this repeat conducted by witkin et al.
[17], there have been 2 other studies of the association between
the il-1 gene family and aids. wang et al. [19] reported no
association between aids and the snps il1b_–1061 and
il1b_3417, which is consistent with our results. price et al. also
identified associations between the control of hiv-1 replication
and the snps il1a_–1613 and il1a_4125 (which are in linkage
disequilibrium) in patients receiving haart [18]. of note, the
allele il1a_⫺1613t has been associated with increased  xxxg1169xxx 
expression [51, 52] but none of these snps exhibited any as-
