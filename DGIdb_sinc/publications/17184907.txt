abstract
because rxr plays a significant role in nuclear receptor signaling as a common heterodimeric partner for tr, ppar, rar, vdr, lxr and
others, the ability of rxr␤ ligand binding domain (lbd) to interact with coregulator peptides bearing lxxll or other interaction motifs was
investigated using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tr-fret). the random phage display peptide d22 and peptides derived
from pgc1␣, src1-4,  xxxg1511xxx -3,  xxxg1771xxx /rap250 and  xxxg1607xxx  yielded the highest tr-fret signal with rxr␤ lbd in the presence of saturating
9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  (9-cisra). several peptides including d22, pgc1␣,  xxxg1512xxx -2,  xxxg1771xxx /rap250 and src1-4 also formed a complex with rxr␤
lbd in the presence of all- xxxd3417xxx  ( xxxd3417xxx ) and the  xxxd2154xxx , phytanic acid (pa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha). determination of the
dose dependency (ec50 ) of these compounds to recruit d22 to rxr␤ lbd indicated that the rank order potency was 9-cisra > pa >  xxxd3417xxx  > dha.
the ligands 9-cisra and  xxxd3417xxx  yielded an overall higher fold-change in d22 recruitment to rxr␤ lbd suggesting that more rxr␤ lbd–d22
complex was formed in the presence of these ligands under the assay conditions tested. the statistical parameter z factor for 9-cisra-induced
recruitment of d22 to rxr␤ lbd was 0.6 after 2 h incubation, indicating a robust methodology that could be applied to high throughput screening.
these results demonstrate that rxr␤ occupied with the fatty acid ligands, dha and pa, can recruit coactivator peptides in a ligand-dependent
manner.

the nuclear receptor retinoid x receptor ␤ (rxr␤;  xxxg1999xxx )
mediates effects of  xxxd3105xxx  derivatives or retinoids on genes
that regulate cell growth, differentiation and neurodevelopment
(mangelsdorf et al., 1990; mangelsdorf and evans, 1995). the
ligand binding domain or e domain contains sequences involved
in ligand recognition, coactivator interaction, ligand-induced
transactivation and receptor dimerization. rxr has been shown
to function as either a homodimer or in heterodimeric complexes
with other nuclear receptors including thyroid  xxxg1603xxx 
(tr),  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr), peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (ppar),  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar), liver x
receptor (lxr) and a number of orphan receptors (mangelsdorf
and evans, 1995). rxr was thought to be unable to bind ligand and act as a silent partner in these heterodimers. however,
recent studies indicate that rxr can interact in permissive heterodimers where either partner can bind ligand (i.e. tr) or in
non-permissive heterodimers where ligand binding at the receptor partner induces an allosteric change to an unoccupied but
active rxr conformation (i.e. vdr) (bettoun et al., 2003;

d.k. stafslien et al. / molecular and cellular endocrinology 264 (2007) 82–89

li et al., 2004). this latter effect has been termed the phantom
ligand effect (schulman et al., 1997).
the high-affinity physiological ligand for rxr is 9-cis
 xxxd3417xxx  (9-cisra) (heyman et al., 1992; levin et al., 1992).
all- xxxd3417xxx  ( xxxd3417xxx ), which is the cognate ligand for
rar, has been reported as having minimal binding affinity to
rxr in vitro but is still capable of upregulating rxr-mediated
transactivation, perhaps due to isomerization to a more active
ligand (heyman et al., 1992). other recently identified ligands
for rxr␤ include phytanic acid (pa) and docosahexaenoic acid
(dha) (radominska-pandya and chen, 2002). pa, a dietary
fatty acid that can elevate to abnormal levels in a variety of
metabolic disorders, has been shown to transactivate rxr␤
in transient transfection studies (zomer et al., 2000). dha is
a fatty acid that plays an important role in embryonic neural
development and can activate the rxr partner in a heterodimer
with the orphan receptor, nurr1, leading to increased survival
of dopaminergic cells and other neurons (wallen-mackenzie et
al., 2003).
retinoids have been used as treatments for a number of cancers and dermatologic conditions. because of the heterodimeric
nature of rxr␤ signaling, retinoid ligands also have the ability
to affect several receptor signaling pathways. selective rxr
ligands, or rexinoids, have been shown to act as efficacious
therapeutics for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, type ii diabetes and obesity via activation of the rxr:ppar␥ heterodimer,
and induction of apoptosis in leukemic myeloid cells (boehm
et al., 1995; bischoff et al., 1999; canan koch et al., 1999;
cesario et al., 2001). rxr has also been implicated in the
etiology of schizophrenia because the rxr␤ gene loci have
been linked to the schizophrenia gene loci (goodman, 1998).
retinoids have also been shown to regulate the dopamine d2
receptor and other genes related to schizophrenia and parkinson’s disease (goodman, 1998; krezel et al., 1998). rxr␤
has been found in the striatum and is distributed throughout the central nervous system, whereas rxr␣ and rxr␥
are more restricted in their expression patterns (zetterstrom et
al., 1999). rxr␣ and rxr␤ have been shown to co-localize
in human epidermal keratinocytes (reichrath et al., 1997).
rxr␣ and rxr␤ expression is also distributed in precancerous lesions of the breast and ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis)
(ariga et al., 2000). reduction in normal rxr␤ expression has
been implicated in prostate cancer progression (alfaro et al.,
2003).
although coactivator interactions with rxr␣ have been
studied in some detail, little has been reported on rxr␤ interactions with coregulator proteins, especially in the presence
of pa and dha. the crystal structure of rxr␤ complexed
with the rexinoid  xxxd1077xxx  indicated that helix 12 does not
cap the ligand binding pocket, unlike most other agonist-bound
nuclear receptors (love et al., 2002). the crystal structure of the
lxr␣/rxr␤ heterodimer showed each receptor bound with
agonist and complexed to a grip-1 (also known as src-2)
peptide with helix 12 positioned in the common agonist conformation capping the ligand binding pocket (svensson et al.,
2003). the differences in helix 12 position between the agonistoccupied lxr␣/rxr␤ heterodimer and the  xxxd1077xxx -bound

83

rxr␤ suggest that coactivator binding stabilizes helix 12 in an
active conformation (svensson et al., 2003). in addition to the
role of helix 12 in ligand-dependent coactivator interactions,
helix 11 of rxr␣ has been shown to also directly stabilize
interactions with  xxxg1449xxx  coactivators (lee and noy, 2002). studies using the rar␤/rxr␣ lbd heterodimer, as compared to
the individual receptors, indicated that heterodimerization does
not affect the ability of each receptor to interact with the second lxxll motif of src1 in the presence of various agonists
(pogenberg et al., 2005). however, binding of both agonists to
the rar␤/rxr␣ lbd heterodimer induced the highest affinity
interaction with coactivators (pogenberg et al., 2005). a similar lxxll peptide from src1 has been shown to interact
with rxr␤ in the presence of 9-cisra but not an antagonist
hx531 by surface plasmon resonance (kanayasu-toyoda et al.,
2005). pgc1, originally identified as a coactivator for ppar, has
been demonstrated as a coactivator for rxr and a pgc1-derived
lxxll peptide interacted with rxr␣ in a time-resolved fluorescence assay (delerive et al., 2002).
to examine the ligand-dependent recruitment of coregulator peptides to rxr␤, a homogeneous tr-fret methodology
was employed using a  xxxg1073xxx  (gst)-tagged
rxr␤ lbd, terbium (tb) chelate-labeled anti-gst antibody,
fluorescein (fl)-labeled coactivator and corepressor peptides
and various ligands. we identified several coactivator peptides
that interacted with rxr␤ lbd in the presence of agonist and
determined the dose dependency (ec50 ) for the ligand-induced
rxr␤ lbd interaction with the random phage display peptide,
d22. our results demonstrate that coactivator peptides differentially associate with rxr␤ lbd, depending on which agonist
is occupying the receptor.

2.2. methods
2.2.1. expression and puriﬁcation of rxrbeta ligand binding domain
sequences containing the recombinant human rxr␤ ligand binding domain
(amino acids 295–533; np 068811.1) were cloned into a gateway entry
clone (pentr  xxxg1999xxx -lbd) via standard pcr cloning methods. an lr clonase
reaction using pentr  xxxg1999xxx -lbd and pdest20 as substrates was used to
generate an expression plasmid encoding the gst-rxr␤ fusion protein. the
resulting expression plasmid was used to create a bacmid for baculovirus production using bac-to-bac (invitrogen). spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells were
infected with the recombinant rxr␤ lbd gst baculovirus in sf900ii media
(invitrogen) containing fbs and harvested at 3 days after infection. the lbd
was purified using glutathione sepharose and superdex 75 chromatography to at
least 80% purity as assessed by visual estimation on a coomassie blue-stained
sds-page gel and stored in buffer containing 50 mm tris–hcl ph 7.5, 150 mm
nacl, 0.5 mm edta, 0.02% triton x-100, 10 mm dtt and 50% glycerol. the
active concentration of lbd was verified using 9-cisra-induced coactivator
recruitment (determination of agonist ec50 ) as described below.
2.2.2. screening of coregulator peptide interactions
an initial evaluation of coregulator peptide interactions was conducted by
adding 60 nm rxr␤ lbd (total protein) plus 5 ␮m ligand or equivalent volume of dmso, 500 nm fl-labeled coregulator peptide and 5 nm tb anti-gst
antibody in a 384-well black assay plate. the plate was incubated at room
temperature for 1 h prior to tr-fret detection, as described below.
2.2.3. estimation of peptide afﬁnity
fl-labeled d22 was serially diluted into assay buffer, followed by addition of
3 nm rxr␤ lbd, 2 nm tb anti-gst antibody and 10 ␮m ligand. an identical
titration was conducted in the absence of receptor to measure diffusion-enhanced
fret. tr-fret was measured after 2 h. the 520 emission in the presence of
receptor (minus the 520 emission in the absence of receptor) was plotted against
the fl-labeled d22 concentration. the data was fit by non-linear regression
using an equation for sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) in graphpad
prism (graphpad software inc., san diego, ca, usa).
2.2.4. determination of agonist ec50 for recruitment of fl-labeled d22 to
rxrbeta lbd
test ligands were diluted to 100× concentration in dmso and serially
diluted in dmso in a 96-well polypropylene plate to maintain ligand solubility.
ligands were then diluted to 2× concentration in assay buffer. the final assay
conditions consisted of 10 ␮l ligand at 2× concentration and 2% dmso, 5 ␮l
of a 4× rxr␤ lbd solution and 5 ␮l of a 4× mixture of tb anti-gst antibody

and fl-labeled d22 peptide. the final concentrations of rxr␤ lbd, tb antigst antibody and fl-labeled d22 were 3, 2 and 350 nm, respectively, in a 20 ␮l
volume per well at 1% dmso. negative control wells included all components
except for: ligand (control for ligand-independent binding) or receptor (negative
control for diffusion-enhanced fret). positive controls wells included all components and maximum agonist. after all components were added, plates were
protected from light and incubated for 2 h (or as listed in figure legend) prior to
measurement of tr-fret.
2.2.5. z factor determination
the z factor was calculated as described by zhang and colleagues with a
value >0.5 indicating an excellent assay with high statistical reliability (zhang
et al., 1999). the z factor was determined, in three independent experiments,
from 24 replicate wells containing either 1 ␮m 9-cisra (positive control) or
no ligand (dmso solvent negative control) plus 3 nm rxr␤ lbd, 350 nm
fl-labeled d22 and 2 nm tb anti-gst antibody. the assay was protected from
light and incubated at room temperature with tr-fret detection at 1, 2, 4, 6
and 24 h. the z factor equation is:
z = 1 −

 3sigma + 3sigma 
c1
c2
|( xxxg1482xxx  −  xxxg1484xxx  )|

where sigma c1 and sigma c2 are the standard deviations of the positive and negative control
wells in the assay plate, respectively and  xxxg1482xxx  and  xxxg1484xxx  are mean values for the
positive and negative control wells in the assay plate, respectively.
2.2.6. detection of tr-fret
tr-fret was measured on a tecan ultra plate reader (tecan, durham, nc,
usa), as described previously (gowda et al., 2006). in brief, the terbium donor
was excited using a 340 nm excitation filter with a 30 nm bandwidth. the terbium
donor emission was measured using a 495 nm filter with a 10 nm bandwidth
and the fluorescein acceptor emission was measured using a 520 nm filter with a
25 nm bandwidth. the data was plotted as the ratio of the 520 emission to the 495
emission versus the log of the ligand concentration. the data were fit using nonlinear regression with an equation for sigmoidal dose response (variable slope)
in graphpad prism (graphpad software inc.) or xlfit4 (idbs, guildford, uk).

3. results
the assay used to examine ligand-dependent receptor–
peptide interactions consisted of tb-chelate labeled anti-gst
antibody, gst-tagged rxr␤ lbd, fl-labeled coregulator peptides containing lxxll coactivator or l-x-x-i/h-i-x-x-x-i/l
corepressor motifs from naturally occurring proteins or fllabeled random phage display peptides, and various ligands. as
shown schematically in fig. 1, ligand binding to rxr␤ lbd
induces a conformational change that can lead to increased affinity for coactivator peptides. the terbium donor label is excited
with light of 340 nm and is capable of transferring energy to the
associated fluorescein acceptor on the bound coactivator peptide. the fluorescein acceptor emits light at 520 nm, resulting in
an increase in the acceptor:donor (520:495) emission ratio.
the 9-cisra-induced interaction of rxr␤ lbd was examined using 19 peptides containing nr boxes from the src  xxxg1449xxx 
class, ppar-specific pgc1␣ and  xxxg1771xxx /rap250,  xxxg1607xxx  and
 xxxg1396xxx  coactivators or from the ncor and smrt corepressors. four random phage display peptides were also tested,
including d22 and c33 which resemble known coactivators
in their sequences flanking the lxxll interaction motif, and
eab1 and  xxxg302xxx  which were originally isolated from tamoxifeninduced interactions with  xxxg730xxx  (chang et al., 1999;
heldring et al., 2004). in the presence of 5 ␮m 9-cisra, fllabeled pgc1␣ and d22 showed the highest fold change in

fig. 1. binding of agonist to rxr␤ lbd gst induces a conformational change in the ligand binding pocket, leading to increased affinity for coactivator peptides
bearing an lxxll or other interaction motif. after excitation with light of 340 nm, a terbium-chelate labeled antibody bound to the gst tag of the rxr␤ lbd can
transfer energy to the fluorescein label on the coactivator peptide, yielding an increase in tr-fret. if the fluorescein-labeled coactivator peptide does not interact
with the rxr␤ lbd, tr-fret is not detected. t, terbium.

the tr-fret ratio representing recruitment to rxr␤ lbd, as
compared to a dmso control (fig. 2a). other fl-labeled peptides that were also recruited at high levels to 9-cisra-occupied
rxr␤ lbd were src1-4,  xxxg1771xxx /rap250,  xxxg1511xxx -3,  xxxg302xxx  and
 xxxg1607xxx  (motif 8). the agonist-induced recruitment of coregulator peptides to rxr␤ lbd was also compared for the rar

agonist,  xxxd3417xxx  and the  xxxd2154xxx , pa and dha (fig. 2b). several peptides, including d22, pgc1␣,  xxxg1512xxx -2,  xxxg1771xxx /rap250
and src1-4 exhibited substantial recruitment to rxr␤ lbd in
the presence of  xxxd3417xxx , pa and dha (fig. 2b). because of the
differential recruitment of d22 to rxr␤ lbd occupied with the
four agonists tested (figs. 2a and 2b), this peptide was chosen

fig. 2. the tr-fret ratio was measured after 1 h for assay wells (n = 3) containing 60 nm rxr␤ lbd gst (total protein), 500 nm fl-labeled coregulator peptide,
5 ␮m ligand or equivalent concentration of solvent (shown in key) and 5 nm tb anti-gst antibody. agonists tested were (a) 9-cisra (9- xxxd2404xxx ) or (b)
dha (cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid), pa (phytanic acid) and  xxxd3417xxx  (all- xxxd3417xxx ); dmso, solvent control for ligand-independent binding.

for further studies to examine the ligand dose dependency of
the d22-rxr␤ lbd interaction. a matrix approach was used
to examine concentrations of fl-labeled d22, tb anti-gst antibody and rxr␤ lbd to use in the tr-fret methodology with
optimal concentrations defined as those that yielded a potent
ligand ec50 and at least two-fold change in tr-fret ratio as
compared to an unliganded rxr␤ control (data not shown).
the final assay conditions were determined as 350 nm peptide,
2 nm antibody and 3 nm rxr␤ lbd (total protein). use of
a lower concentration of receptor improves the sensitivity of
the assay to examine more potent agonist compounds and is
advantageous in a methodology that can be employed as a high
throughput screen. the upper and lower tr-fret plateaus may
differ slightly from day-to-day experiments due to normal variation in gain settings, but the overall tr-fret fold-change and
ec50 values were consistent between experiments and different
batches of purified rxr␤ lbd.
to estimate the affinity of fl-labeled d22 for rxr␤ lbd
occupied with the various agonists, a titration of fl-labeled d22
was conducted in the presence of 3 nm rxr␤ lbd, 2 nm tb
anti-gst antibody and 10 ␮m ligand. the difference in the 520
emission (minus the 520 emission in the absence of receptor
to correct for diffusion-enhanced fret) was plotted against
the fl-labeled d22 concentration after a 2 h incubation (fig. 3).
these results indicated that rxr␤ lbd occupied with 9-cisra
or  xxxd3417xxx  had approximate affinities (ec50 ) of 60 and 80 nm
for fl-labeled d22, respectively. rxr␤ lbd occupied with the
 xxxd2154xxx , pa or dha, had approximate affinities >1 ␮m for
fl-labeled d22.
the dose dependency of agonist-induced association of fllabeled d22 with rxr␤ lbd was determined by titrating
increasing concentrations of 9-cisra into assay wells containing
constant amounts of rxr␤ lbd, fl-labeled d22 peptide and
tb anti-gst antibody. fl-labeled d22 was recruited to rxr␤
lbd in a 9-cisra-dependent manner and was characterized by

fig. 4. the tr-fret ratio was measured after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h for assay
wells (n = 24) containing 3 nm rxr␤ lbd gst (total protein), 350 nm fllabeled d22 coactivator peptide and 2 nm tb anti-gst antibody. the experiment
shown is representative of three independent experiments. agonist was 9-cisra
(9- xxxd2404xxx ); dmso, solvent control for ligand-independent binding.

an ec50 value of 3.1 nm at 2 h (fig. 4). this ec50 was stable over
a 24-hour time of incubation (table 1). the z factor, which provides a statistical indicator of the reliability of the methodology,
was calculated as 0.6 after 2 h incubation and was at least 0.5
from 1 to 6 h of incubation (table 1), indicating a methodology
that could be employed to screen test compounds as agonists of
rxr␤. to examine the compatibility of this assay with solvents
often found in compound libraries, solvent tolerance tests were
conducted with increasing concentrations of dmso, methanol
and ethanol and indicated that the assay was stable up to 8% of
each solvent in addition to the 1% dmso already included in
the assay (data not shown).
the dose dependency of 9-cisra,  xxxd3417xxx , pa and dha
to induce an association between fl-labeled d22 and rxr␤
lbd was also examined (fig. 5). all four agonists resulted
in recruitment of fl-labeled d22 to rxr␤ lbd and the rank
order potency was 9-cisra > pa >  xxxd3417xxx  > dha (fig. 5). the 9cisra ec50 of 5.8 ± 1.0 nm in this experiment, compared to the
3.0 ± 0.1 nm determined in the z factor experiments (table 1),
indicates some of the variability that can be observed when
slightly different methods of ligand dilutions and plating assay
components are used and highlight the need for consistency in
experiments when comparing test compounds to a known agonist. both 9-cisra and  xxxd3417xxx  resulted in the most substantial
recruitment of fl-labeled d22 to rxr␤ lbd in assay conditions

fig. 3. fl-labeled d22 was serially diluted into assay buffer with final assay
conditions containing 3 nm rxr␤ lbd gst (total protein), 2 nm tb antigst antibody and 10 ␮m ligand (shown in legend). a parallel titration was
done in the absence of receptor to control for diffusion-enhanced fret. the
assay was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. the delta 520 nm value is the
520 emission from the peptide titration in the presence of rxr␤ lbd minus
the 520 nm emission from the peptide titration in the absence of rxr␤ lbd.

note: ec50 values were measured over time in assays (n = 24) containing 3 nm
rxr␤ lbd gst (total protein), 350 nm fl-labeled d22 coactivator peptide
and 2 nm tb anti-gst antibody. z values were calculated from 24 replicates of
maximum agonist (1 ␮m 9- xxxd2404xxx ) and no agonist (1% dmso solvent
control). the results are the average from three independent experiments.

fig. 5. ligands (each at n = 4) were diluted into assay buffer containing 3 nm
rxr␤ lbd gst (total protein), 350 nm fl-labeled d22 coactivator peptide
and 2 nm tb anti-gst antibody. the tr-fret ratio was measured after 2 h.
the experiment shown is representative of two independent experiments. agonists are as described in fig. 2. dmso, solvent control for ligand-independent
binding.

containing 3 nm receptor, 350 nm fl-labeled d22 and 2 nm tb
anti-gst antibody, compared to pa and dha. the lower foldchange in tr-fret ratio observed in the presence of pa and
dha in the dose dependency experiments, coupled with the estimations of fl-labeled d22 affinity for agonist-occupied rxr␤
lbd, indicates that the complex of rxr␤ lbd with these fatty
acid agonists has lower affinity for d22 than the complexes
formed in the presence of 9-cisra and  xxxd3417xxx . it is also possible that the lower tr-fret ratio with pa and dha is due in
part to ligand-induced alterations in the rxr␤ conformation.
4. discussion
our in vitro results indicate that several coactivator peptides
tested are capable of binding to the rxr␤ lbd in response
to ligand. rxr␤ binds with highest affinity to its physiological ligand, 9-cisra (heyman et al., 1992). as expected,
9-cisra induced an interaction between rxr␤ lbd and several
coactivator peptides (fig. 2a) and was the most potent ligand
(ec50 = 3–6 nm) for recruitment of fl-labeled d22 to rxr␤
lbd (fig. 5 and table 1). the coactivator peptide d22 was chosen for further characterization in a tr-fret assay amenable to
high throughput applications because d22 exhibited differential
recruitment to rxr␤ depending on which agonist was bound
to the receptor (fig. 2b). d22 contains sequences flanking its
lxxll motifs which resemble the sequences from the natural
coregulators, pgc1␣,  xxxg1607xxx , shp and  xxxg1594xxx  (chang et al.,
1999). given its resemblance to pgc1␣, the interaction of d22
with rxr␤ is in agreement with previous findings that pgc1␣
interacts with and coactivates human rxr␣ (delerive et al.,
2002). the reported 9-cisra affinity values for mouse rxr␤
are 18 or 22 nm (allenby et al., 1993; kitareewan et al., 1996).
the ligand dose dependency values (ec50 ) reported here are a
composite value that encompasses multiple equilibrium events
including ligand binding to the receptor, ligand-induced receptor conformational changes and fl-labeled d22 peptide binding
to the receptor. therefore, these ligand dose dependency values
when measuring association with peptides may not be equivalent to the ligand affinity value in the absence of such peptides.

87

the increased potency of 9-cisra in mediating d22 association
with rxr␤, compared to the reported 9-cisra affinity value for
rxr␤, may reflect the implications from crystal structure studies that coactivator peptide binding stabilizes helix 12 of the lbd
in an active conformation, leading to a more thermodynamically
stable state (svensson et al., 2003).
the interaction of coactivator peptides with rxr␤ in the
presence of pa and dha was of particular interest. these fatty
acids have only recently been identified as bona ﬁde ligands
for rxr␤ (radominska-pandya and chen, 2002), and their
role in coregulator interactions with rxr␤ in particular has
not been explored. pa has been shown to upregulate rxr␣mediated reporter gene expression between pa concentrations
of 4–64 ␮m, and the ki for pa displacement of 9-cisra from
rxr␣ was 4 ␮m (kitareewan et al., 1996). our pa ec50 findings of 100 nm are more similar to the pa ic50 value of 200 nm
for protection of photoincorporation of [3 h]9-cisra into rxr␤
(radominska-pandya and chen, 2002). pa, a dietary fatty acid
found in dairy products, meat and fish, is present in micromolar
concentrations in the serum of healthy patients but can be elevated 100-fold in individuals with metabolic disorders such as
 xxxg1741xxx  (verhoeven et al., 1998; zomer et al., 2000). pa
has been shown to be a ligand for ppar␣, and ppar␣:rxr␤
heterodimers exhibit synergistic transactivation of reporter gene
expression in the presence of pa (zomer et al., 2000). thus, it is
likely that pa and rxr␤ are important regulators of the ppar
signaling pathway in the control of fatty acid metabolism and
represent important drug targets for diabetes and obesity. our in
vitro results indicate that pa-occupied rxr␤ is capable of associating with several coactivator peptides in a ligand-dependent
manner, and this association is dependent on pa concentration as
shown with fl-labeled d22. studies by pogenberg et al. (2005)
using rar␤/rxr␣ lbd complexes indicate that heterodimerization does not significantly affect receptor conformation or
the ability to recruit coactivators. studies in the presence of
linked heterodimers will be useful to further assess the effect
of heterodimerization on coactivator association.
dha is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid derived from
the diet, important for early brain maturation, and present as
30–50% of total fatty acid in mammalian brain. dha was
demonstrated as a ligand for mouse rxr␣ and was able to
induce association of src1 with rxr␣ in transfected cells
and in an in vitro gst pull-down assay (de urquiza et al.,
2000). dha was conclusively shown to be a ligand for rxr␤
by radominska-pandya and chen, and our ec50 of 830 nm for
dha-induced recruitment of fl-labeled d22 to rxr␤ is similar
to the 1 ␮m dha ic50 observed in the photoprotection studies
with 9-cisra and rxr␤ (radominska-pandya and chen, 2002).
in our studies, dha was able to recruit coactivator peptides
to rxr␤ in a differential manner, in the presence of different
peptides associated to a greater extent in the presence of pa
versus dha (fig. 2b). our studies indicate that dha binding
results in a rxr␤ conformation that is capable of interacting
with coactivator peptides.
the finding that  xxxd3417xxx  was able to induce coactivator recruitment to rxr␤ lbd to the levels observed in fig. 2b was
surprising, given the reports that  xxxd3417xxx  does not have significant

88

d.k. stafslien et al. / molecular and cellular endocrinology 264 (2007) 82–89

affinity for rxr␤. despite this low affinity binding,  xxxd3417xxx  has
been shown to be able to transactivate rxr␣-mediated gene
expression with 40-fold lower potency than 9-cisra, perhaps
due to isomerization to an active form (mangelsdorf et al., 1990;
heyman et al., 1992). in fig. 3, rxr␤ occupied with 9-cisra
or  xxxd3417xxx  had similar approximate affinity (60 nm versus 80 nm)
for fl-labeled d22, under saturating ligand conditions. in our
dose dependency assay,  xxxd3417xxx  was 50- to 100-fold less potent
than 9-cisra in recruiting fl-labeled d22 to rxr␤ lbd (fig. 5
and table 1), in agreement with its lower activity on rxr. in
a [3 h]-9-cisra charcoal binding assay, excess unlabeled  xxxd3417xxx 
was much less efficient at displacing [3 h]-9-cisra compared
to competition with unlabeled 9-cisra, confirming that  xxxd3417xxx 
is not binding with high affinity to our rxr␤ lbd preparation
(data not shown).
in summary, our results describe coactivator peptide association with rxr␤ lbd in the presence of agonists 9-cisra,
 xxxd3417xxx , pa and dha. several peptides, including motifs from
the src family of coactivators, pgc1␣ and d22, interacted
with the highest signal in a homogeneous tr-fret assay. the
methodology described here has been applied previously to
examine other nuclear receptor–coactivator interactions (zhou
et al., 1998; gowda et al., 2006). advantages of this tb-based
assay include the ability to couple the tb donor with a common acceptor such as fluorescein as well as the time-resolved
aspect of the interaction which reduces background interference from light scatter and compound autofluorescence. this
format is being applied to other nuclear receptor–coactivator
interactions and provides a robust and reliable method for
high throughput screening of pharmaceutical compounds, as
indicated by the z factors of at least 0.5. our results indicate that the rank order potency for association of d22 with
rxr␤ lbd was 9-cisra > pa >  xxxd3417xxx  > dha and demonstrate
that the recently identified rxr␤ ligands, pa and dha, can
recruit coactivator peptides to rxr␤ lbd in a ligand-dependent
manner. this assay can be used to characterize the liganddependent coactivator peptide association with rxr␤ in the
presence of agonists, antagonists, or rexinoid compounds and
could potentially identify compounds that may serve as novel
therapeutics in the disruption of coactivator-receptor interactions for the treatment of cancer, neurological disorders and
diabetes.
