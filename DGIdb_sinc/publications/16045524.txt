objective to examine the effects of  xxxd1957xxx  on the production of th1 and th2 cytokines by lymphocytes from women undergoing unexplained recurrent spontaneous miscarriage (rsm).
design controlled prospective, clinical study conducted in a maternity hospital and a university-based immunology laboratory.
setting faculty of medicine, kuwait university and kuwait maternity hospital.
sample thirty women with unexplained rsm.
methods peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from women with unexplained rsm were isolated from
venous blood by density gradient sedimentation and stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha). culture
supernatants assayed for interferon (ifn)-g,  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a, interleukin (il)-4, il-6 and
il-10 by elisa. levels of the progesterone-induced blocking factor (pibf) were also measured.
main outcome measures cytokine production in the presence and absence of progesterone and  xxxd1957xxx .
results  xxxd1957xxx  significantly inhibited the production of the th1 cytokines ifn-g (p ¼ 0.0001) and
 xxxg2296xxx  (p ¼ 0.005) and induced an increase in the levels of the th2 cytokines il-4 (p ¼ 0.03) and il-6
(p ¼ 0.017) resulting in a substantial shift in the ratio of th1/th2 cytokines. the effect of  xxxd1957xxx 
was blocked by the addition of the progesterone-receptor antagonist mifepristone, indicating that  xxxd1957xxx  was acting via the  xxxg1737xxx .  xxxd1957xxx  induced the production of pibf.
conclusion  xxxd1957xxx  inhibits the production of the th1 cytokines ifn-g and  xxxg2296xxx  from lymphocytes and up-regulates the production of the th2 cytokines il-4 and il-6, inducing a th1 to th2 cytokine
shift.
introduction
cytokines associated with the cellular immune response
may be responsible for at least a proportion of ‘unexplained’
recurrent spontaneous miscarriages (rsms), 1,2 which
accounts for about 40– 60% of all cases of rsms.3 it has
been suggested that successful pregnancy is associated with
a down-regulation of th1-type activity and enhancement of
th2-type activity.1,2,4 – 6 interleukin (il)-2, interferon
(ifn)-g and  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) are cytokines
with adverse effects on the conceptus and are characteristic
of th1-type t cells. these cytokines induce cytotoxic and
inflammatory reactions and are responsible for the induction of cell-mediated inflammation.7 th2 cells secrete il-4,

 xxxg1180xxx , il-6, il-10 and il-13, which are associated with the
induction of humoural immunity. some of these cytokines
have anti-inflammatory activity.7
elevated levels of the th1 cytokines il-2 and ifn-g,
and decreased levels of the th2 cytokine il-10, have been
reported after antigen- and mitogen-induced activation of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from women
with spontaneous recurrent miscarriage.8 the activation of
pbmc with trophoblast antigens has shown that women
with unexplained rsm have a th1-type cytokine profile.1
we have previously demonstrated increased production of
ifn-g,  xxxg2296xxx , tnf-h and il-2 by mitogen-activated
pbmc from women with rsm and increased production
of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-6 and il-10 by pbmc from women with
normal pregnancy at the end of the first trimester.9 a similar th1 bias in unexplained rsm and a th2 bias in successful pregnancy is seen after stimulation with autologous
placental cells and with trophoblast antigens.10 piccinni
et al.11 demonstrated significantly greater numbers of il-4and il-10-producing t cell clones generated from cells
infiltrating the decidua of women with normal pregnancy
compared with those undergoing unexplained rsm. these
data support the contention that women with normal pregnancy have a higher th2 bias, while women with a history
of unexplained rsm have a bias towards th1 reactivity.

cytokine modulation by  xxxd1957xxx 

however, the association between th1/ th2 cytokines
and pregnancy outcome has been challenged by some researchers. bates et al.12 reported that the production of il-4
and il-10 was increased in women with a history of
recurrent pregnancy loss while no differences were observed
in the levels of the th1 cytokine ifn-g. shimada et al.13
reported higher levels of il-4-positive t cells on flow
cytometry analysis in women with rsm, suggesting increased levels of th2-type cells in these women. this group
has also reported that treatment of women with rsm with
 xxxd2207xxx  leads to decreased th1/ th2
lymphocyte ratios and suggest that high th1/ th2 ratios in
rsm may have an aetiological basis.14 based on the demonstration of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines at the
uteroplacental interface in mice and the beneficial roles for
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn-g, zourbas et al.15
suggested that influences of th1 and th2 cytokines are
complex and probably occur in sequential windows. despite
these conflicting data, substantial literature exists to suggest
an increased th1-bias in recurrent miscarriage.1,8 – 11,16 – 20
this possible association between rsm and maternal
th1 cytokine bias raises the possibility of manipulating the
th1/th2 cytokine balance to down-regulate th1 cytokines
and increase the chances of a successful pregnancy. progesterone, which has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties,21 favours the development of human t cells
producing th2 cytokines.22 progesterone also blocks the
production of th1 cytokines by lymphocytes responding to
in vitro stimulation by a trophoblast antigen extract.23
in this study, we have investigated the potential immunomodulatory properties of  xxxd1957xxx .  xxxd1957xxx  is a potent orally administered progestogen, similar to
endogenous progesterone in its molecular structure and
pharmacological effects, with a high affinity for the  xxxg1737xxx . we also studied the effect of  xxxd1957xxx  on the production of progesterone-induced blocking
factor (pibf), which is a protein produced by pregnancy
lymphocytes following exposure to progesterone.24 pibf
inhibits several cell-mediated immune responses particularly cell-mediated cytotoxicity and natural killer (nk) cell
activity and is thought to play an important immunoprotective role in pregnancy.25

methods
this study was approved by the ethics committees of
the faculty of medicine, kuwait university and kuwait
maternity hospital. thirty women with a history of at least
three rsms in the first trimester and no history of successful pregnancy were enrolled into the study. patients were
routinely investigated for possible anatomical, endocrinologic, infectious, genetic and immunological causes of miscarriage; immunological tests included lupus anticoagulant,
anti-cardiolipin and anti-nuclear antibodies. these subjects
had no demonstrable cause for their pregnancy losses.
informed consent was obtained from women who volunteered to participate, before blood samples were collected.
peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture from
subjects on the day of miscarriage. pbmc were separated
by  xxxd3253xxx -paque (pharmacia biotech, sweden) density
gradient centrifugation, suspended in rpmi medium
(gibcobrl, gaithersburg, usa) containing 10% fetal calf
serum (gibcobrl), aliquoted into 96-well tissue culture
plates at a density of 105 cells per well and then challenged
with the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (pha) (sigmaaldrich, st louis, missouri, usa) at a concentration of
5 ag/ml for a period of 96 hours. supernatants were
harvested at 96 hours for the estimation of cytokine levels.
the optimal concentrations of progesterone (sigmaaldrich) and  xxxd1957xxx  (provided by solvay pharmaceuticals, hannover, germany) were determined during
standardisation experiments. in initial standardisation
experiments on 10 samples, progesterone and  xxxd1957xxx  were tested at three concentrations 104 mol/l,
105 mol/l and 106 mol/l. while  xxxd1957xxx  and progesterone  xxxd1891xxx 4 mol/l showed inhibitory effects on the
production of ifn-g (p ¼ 0.001), this dose did not affect
the production of  xxxg2296xxx . at the lowest concentrations of
106 mol/l  xxxd1957xxx  and progesterone, no effect was
observed on the production of ifn-g and  xxxg2296xxx .  xxxd1957xxx  and progesterone  xxxd1891xxx 5 mol/l brought about
significant reduction in the levels of ifn-g (p ¼ 0.0001 for
 xxxd1957xxx , p ¼ 0.02 for progesterone) and  xxxg2296xxx  (p ¼
0.041 for  xxxd1957xxx , p ¼ 0.05 for progesterone) (data
not shown). similarly,  xxxd1891xxx 6 mol/l, progesterone did not

induce increased production of the th2 cytokines il-4, il-6
and il-10 (data not shown).  xxxd1957xxx  and progesterone  xxxd1891xxx 5 mol/l induced significant increase in the production of il-4 (p ¼ 0.039 for  xxxd1957xxx , p ¼ 0.011 for
progesterone) and il-6 (p ¼ 0.011 for  xxxd1957xxx , p ¼
0.032 for progesterone). based on this dose–response analysis we chose the concentration of 105 mol/l of  xxxd1957xxx  and progesterone for further studies.
each hormone was tested by addition to the culture wells
in addition to the presence of pha described above. in
order to verify whether the immunomodulatory effects of
 xxxd1957xxx  and progesterone are mediated via the  xxxg1737xxx , the  xxxg1737xxx  antagonist
mifepristone (sigma-aldrich) was also added to the supernatant. in initial standardisation experiments, samples from
four subjects were studied. mifepristone  xxxd1891xxx 3, 104, 105,
106 and 107 mol/l was added to pha-stimulated pbmc
cultures, and cytokine production then assessed. based on
these experiments, the dose of 106 mol/l of mifepristone
was selected because mifepristone by itself at doses of 103,
104 and 105 brought about a reduction in levels of ifn-g
and  xxxg2296xxx .  xxxd1891xxx 6 mol/l, mifepristone did not affect cytokine production by itself nor does it affect cell proliferation (data not shown).
cytokine levels were measured in supernatants using
antibody-sandwich elisa kits (coulter immunotech, marseilles, france) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. standard curves were plotted for each of the
cytokines tested using reference cytokines and the results

read from these curves. all samples and standards were
tested in triplicate. intra- and inter-assay variability were
both within acceptable limits, with coefficient of variation
values <10. the sensitivities of detection of cytokines are as
follows: 3 pg/ml of ifn-g, 10 pg/ml of  xxxg2296xxx , 5 pg/ml of
il-4, 3 pg/ml of il-6 and 5 pg/ml of il-10.
for the estimation of the pibf, pbmc were obtained
from pregnant women, aliquoted at 2  106 cells per ml in
tissue culture microtiter plates and treated with different
concentrations of  xxxd1957xxx  (12 –100 ag/ml) in the
presence of mifepristone for 16 hours at 37°c in a humid
chamber. lymphocytes were washed in order to eliminate
excess hormones and centrifuged onto microscope glass
slides, which were then fixed with cold acetone and then
incubated with 1:100 diluted monoclonal anti-pibf antibodies, for 1 hour. the slides were washed twice with pbs
and incubated with 1:100 diluted horseradish peroxidasecoupled anti-mouse igg (sigma) for 30 minutes. the reaction was developed with aminoethylcarbazole. nuclei were
counterstained with haematoxylin and the slides mounted
with gelatin – glycerol. the percentage of pibf-positive
cells was determined by counting under the microscope.
the standard mann – whitney u test was used for nonparametric comparisons of stimulation indices and median
cytokine levels, as the data were not normally distributed. differences were considered significant if the p value  0.05.

results
the presence of  xxxd1957xxx  or progesterone in
pbmc cultures resulted in significantly reduced levels of
the th1 cytokines, ifn-g and  xxxg2296xxx  (table 1). levels of
both il-4 and il-6 were significantly elevated in the
presence of  xxxd1957xxx  or progesterone, but il-10
production was unaffected (table 1).
because relative levels of th1 and th2 cytokines are
probably of greater importance than their absolute levels,
we calculated the ratios of th1 to th2 cytokines. a marked
reduction in these ratios was observed in cultures containing  xxxd1957xxx  or progesterone indicating a decrease in
th1 cytokine bias (table 2).

mitogen-simulated pbmc from 15 subjects with unexplained rsm were cultured with  xxxd1957xxx  or progesterone in the presence or absence of 106 mol / l of
mifepristone. mifepristone blocked the observed increase in
the levels of ifn-g and  xxxg2296xxx , and the observed decrease
in the levels of il-4 and il-6. while  xxxd1957xxx  and
progesterone brought about a reduction in th1 –th2 cytokine ratios, the addition of mifepristone in these cultures
results in increased th1– th2 cytokine ratios (table 3).
 xxxd1957xxx  induced the production of pibf in a
dose-dependent manner (table 4) with 100 mg/ml of
 xxxd1957xxx  bringing about an almost fourfold increase
in pibf production. the addition of mifepristone to these
cultures resulted in an almost complete inhibition of pibf
production; while the addition of  xxxd1957xxx  to lymphocyte cultures increased the pibf-positivity from 21% to
5%, the presence of mifepristone in the cultures results in a
reversal of pibf positivity to 22% (data not shown).

discussion
evidence for a dichotomous maternal t-helper reactivity
in pregnancy first emerged from animal studies, which
showed that normal pregnancy is associated with a protective th2 cytokine pattern, while pregnancy loss can be
mediated by a maternal th1 bias.4,26 in humans, flow
cytometry studies have shown that normal pregnancy is
associated with increased levels of il-4-producing t cells
and reduced levels of ifn-g- and il-2-producing cells
indicating a shift towards th2 bias.27 while a direct
cause-and-effect relationship between maternal th1 reactivity and human pregnancy loss has not been established,
the maternal cytokine bias is skewed in women with
unexplained rsm; higher levels of th1 cytokines are
produced by mitogen- or antigen-activated pbmc from
recurrent aborters while higher levels of th2 cytokines are
secreted by pregnant women with a history of reproductive
success.1,8 – 11,16 – 20
we have demonstrated that  xxxd1957xxx  downregulates th1 cytokines and up-regulates th2 cytokines resulting in a shift in cytokine bias away from th1 dominance
and towards th2-bias. ifn-g and  xxxg2296xxx  have been shown
to deter embryo development, implantation events and proliferation of the trophoblast cells26 and to have apoptotic
effects on human trophoblast cells.27 in animals, these
cytokines bring about fetal demise when injected during

1099

gestation28 and up-regulate the procoagulant, fg12.29 ifn-g
and  xxxg2296xxx  may also mediate placental/fetal damage via activation of nk activity and macrophages.
il-4 is the quintessential th2 cytokine and increased
production of il-4 has been shown to favour further th2
bias.7 progesterone has been shown to promote the differentiation of t cells into th2 effectors and is thought to be
responsible for a th2 switch at the maternal –fetal interface
during normal, successful gestation.22 in this study, progesterone was tested at a concentration (105 mol/l) that is
similar to that achieved at maternal– fetal tissues.24 thus,
the increased production of the th2 cytokine il-4 and the
decreased production of the th1 cytokines ifn-g and  xxxg2296xxx 
together could well result in a substantial swing in th1/th2
reactivity towards the pregnancy-conducive th2 profile
and away from the potentially harmful th1 profile.
pibf is a protein produced by pregnancy lymphocytes
upon exposure to progesterone that inhibits various cellmediated immune reactions.24,25 in mice30 and in humans
(raghupathy et al., unpublished data) pibf up-regulates
th2 cytokine production and thus brings about a shift
from th1 to th2 cytokine bias. the percentage of pibfpositive lymphocytes is significantly reduced in women
prone to pregnancy loss, preterm labour and threatened
miscarriage.31 pibf prevents fetal resorptions in a murine
model of pregnancy loss32 and is thought to play an important role in pregnancy by helping the conceptus escape
immune surveillance.24,30 thus, the ability of  xxxd1957xxx  to induce the production of pibf may well provide an
indirect beneficial effect in addition to its ability to directly
effect a th1 to th2 cytokine shift.
our data from co-incubation with mifepristone suggest
that progesterone and  xxxd1957xxx  induce cytokine
modulation by binding to the  xxxg1737xxx  on
lymphocytes. we cannot rule out the possibility that they
may act via the  xxxg1601xxx , although a previous study demonstrated that the inhibition of pibf
production was blocked by mifepristone but not by a
specific  xxxg1601xxx  blocker ( ru43044).33
blood samples for this study were obtained at the time of
miscarriage and it has been demonstrated that the timing of
the sampling could influence cytokine profiles.19,34 marzi
et al.8 have reported increased production of th1 cytokines in women who aborted, when samples were taken
prior to miscarriage. we have previously demonstrated that
miscarriage-prone women who undergo another spontaneous miscarriage have a stronger th1-bias than miscarriageprone women who proceed to have a normal delivery.18
however, cytokine profiles do need to be established at different time points during gestation for us to ascertain th1
versus th2 bias at different stages of pregnancy.
choi et al.23 suggest that potentially immunosuppressive
doses of progesterone may benefit individuals in whom the
aetiology of rsm is related to predominance of maternal
th1 cytokines. however, orally administered progesterone
is poorly absorbed, is subject to first-pass mechanism, has a

short biologic half life,35 loses much of its bioactivity36 and
is rapidly cleared.37 the progesterone used in this study is
synthetically prepared from a naturally occurring plant
steroid precursor and not the micronised version currently
available for oral and vaginal use. upon oral administration, the micronised form is rapidly metabolised into nonprogestogenic metabolites due to the first-pass effect.37,38
there is also considerable intraindividual and interindividual variation in the metabolism of orally administered
micronised progesterone.39 on the other hand, the high bioavailability of orally administered  xxxd1957xxx  makes
it attractive from a potentially therapeutic perspective. this
study is based on in vitro experiments; if clinical trials
confirm the cytokine-redirecting capability of  xxxd1957xxx , it may offer the potential for an effective, safe and
orally administered therapeutic intervention in rsm with
high th1 cytokine bias as the aetiology.

conclusion
 xxxd1957xxx  has an immunomodulatory capability
and appears to induce a maternal cytokine shift from th1
cytokine dominance towards a th2 bias. this may act directly and also indirectly via the production of the pibf.
