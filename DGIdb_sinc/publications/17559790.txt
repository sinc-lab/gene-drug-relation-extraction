abstract
two iodophenylazide derivatives of reserpine and one iodophenylazide derivative of  xxxd3330xxx  have been synthesized and
characterized as photoaﬃnity labels of the vesicle  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2). these compounds are 18-o-[3-(3 0 -iodo-4 0 -azidophenyl)-propionyl]methyl reserpate (aippmer), 18-o-[n-(3 0 -iodo-4 0 -azidophenethyl)glycyl]methyl reserpate (iapeglymer), and
2-n-[(3 0 -iodo-4 0 -azidophenyl)-propionyl] xxxd3330xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx -aipp). inhibition of [3h]dopamine uptake into puriﬁed chromaﬃn granule
ghosts showed ic50 values of approximately 37 nm for reserpine, 83 nm for aippmer, 200 nm for iapeglymer, and 2.1 lm for
 xxxd3330xxx -aipp. carrier-free radioiodinated [125i]iapeglymer and [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp were synthesized and used to photoaﬃnity label chromaﬃn granule membranes. sodium  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page) analysis showed speciﬁc
[125i]iapeglymer labeling of a polypeptide that migrated as a broad band (approximately 55–90 kda), with the majority of the label
located between 70 and 80 kda. the labeling by [125i]iapeglymer was blocked by 100 nm reserpine, 10 lm  xxxd3330xxx , 1 mm
serotonin, and 10 mm ()-norepinephrine and dopamine. analysis of [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp-labeled chromaﬃn granule membranes by
sds–page and autoradiography demonstrated speciﬁc labeling of a similar polypeptide, which was blocked by 1 lm reserpine and
10 lm  xxxd3330xxx . incubation of [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp-photolabeled chromaﬃn granule membranes in the presence of the glycosidase
n-glycanase shifted the apparent molecular weight of vmat2 to approximately 51 kda. these data indicate that [125i]iapeglymer
and [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp are eﬀective photoaﬃnity labels for vmat2.

psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia [6], depression
[7,8], bipolar disorder [9], and addiction [10].
chromaﬃn granules are subcellular organelles located
within the chromaﬃn cell of the adrenal medulla that store
large quantities of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. since the chromaﬃn granule is a secretory
vesicle, it has served as a model for studying neurosecretion
[11–13]. amines are transported into the lumen by  xxxg2099xxx ,
located within the chromaﬃn granule membrane [14,15].
although both  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 are present in bovine
chromaﬃn granules, vmat2 is the predominate isoform
[16,17]. the transport reaction is driven by an electrochemical proton gradient that is generated by a proton translocating atpase via an unknown mechanism [18]. the
stoichiometry of transport is one biogenic amine molecule
in for two protons out [19].
from cloning studies, the bovine vmat2 contains 518
amino acids and is predicted to contain 12 transmembrane
helices [16], similar to other known transport proteins,
both mammalian [20] and bacterial [21,22]. the primary
sequence of bovine vmat2 predicts three potential sites
of n-linked glycosylation in a large lumenal loop between
transmembrane helices 1 and 2. a disulﬁde bridge has been
identiﬁed in the human vmat2 between cys126 and
cys333 [23]. these cysteines are on the luminal surface of
 xxxg2099xxx , but the role of this disulﬁde bridge on  xxxg2099xxx 
function is currently unknown.
several compounds have been shown to inhibit
vmat2, the most potent being the rauwolﬁa alkaloid,
reserpine. the structure of reserpine consists of a ﬁvering alkaloid system with a trimethoxybenzoyl moiety
connected to it by an ester linkage. the ﬁve-ring complex
includes a portion that is analogous to 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a substrate of the transport protein.
[3h]reserpine has been observed to bind to the transporter with both a high aﬃnity (30 pm [24]) and a
low aﬃnity (25 nm [25]). the high-aﬃnity site is dependent upon the presence of an electrochemical proton
gradient across the vesicle membrane, whereas the lowaﬃnity site is not. in chromaﬃn granule membranes,
scherman and henry [25] observed the density of highaﬃnity sites to be about 7 pmol/mg and that of lowaﬃnity sites to be about 60 pmol/mg. stern-bach et al.
[26] puriﬁed the transporter, following bound [3h]reserpine through the puriﬁcation steps; the molecular weight,
as determined by sds–page, was estimated to be
approximately 80 kda.
another class of inhibitors of the transporter is  xxxd3330xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx ) and its derivatives. this class of drugs
binds to a single high-aﬃnity site on vmat2. the commonly used radioligand to study this site, [3h]dihydrotetrabenazine ([3h]tbzoh), binds to bovine chromaﬃn
granule membranes with a kd of about 3 nm and a site
density of about 60 pmol/mg. transporter substrates inhibit [3h]tbzoh binding to this site with ki values of
approximately 12 lm [27].  xxxd2419xxx , a serotonin 5ht2a receptor ligand, also binds to this site with a kd of

69

about 6.1 nm [28].  xxxg2098xxx  does not bind  xxxd3330xxx  but does
bind reserpine and  xxxd2419xxx  [29], suggesting that  xxxd3330xxx  might bind to a site diﬀerent from those of  xxxd2419xxx  or reserpine.
although the vesicular monoamine transporters have
been puriﬁed and cloned from several sources, the ligand
binding site(s) of vmat2 has not been thoroughly characterized. recent models of ligand binding to vmat2
indicate three potential binding sites: the substrate/highaﬃnity reserpine site, the  xxxd2419xxx  site, and the  xxxd3330xxx  site. these sites may be distinct sites on the
transporter, or overlapping regions, with each ligand
having somewhat diﬀerent contact sites. photoaﬃnity
labeling studies in our laboratory using a  xxxd2419xxx 
derivative, [125i]azik, identiﬁed the n terminus as the
insertion site for  xxxd2419xxx  [30]. additionally, the n terminus of vmat2 was the site of insertion of a  xxxd3330xxx 
photoaﬃnity probe,  xxxd3330xxx -aipp, which also labeled the
intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 10
and 11. these data indicate the importance of the n
and c termini and transmembrane domains 5–8 for
ligand binding.
photoaﬃnity labeling is a powerful technique used to
identify binding-site peptides from receptors. in this study,
we report the synthesis and characterization of several iodophenylazide derivatives of reserpine and  xxxd3330xxx ,
which inhibit [3h]dopamine uptake into chromaﬃn granules. also, a photoactivatable reserpine derivative and a
 xxxd3330xxx  derivative have been radioiodinated to high
speciﬁc activity (2200 ci/mmol) and used successfully as
photoaﬃnity labels for vmat2.

aippmer
scheme 1. synthetic scheme for aippmer (iv). aipp (i) was reﬂuxed in
oxalyl chloride for 2 h to produce aipp-cl (ii). unpuriﬁed ii was reacted
overnight at room temperature with methyl reserpate (iii) to yield
aippmer (iv).

synthesis of 18-o-[3-(3 0 -iodo-40 -azidophenyl)propionyl]methyl
reserpate (aippmer)
(iv scheme 1). the starting material 3-iodo-4-azidophenyl- xxxd3029xxx  (aipp; i) was synthesized according to
the procedures of lowndes et al. [32]. the acyl chloride
of aipp (ii) was synthesized using a modiﬁed procedure
of adams and ulich [33]. aipp (25 mg, 0.0789 mmol)
was dissolved in 100 ll of oxalyl chloride (1.165 mmol).
this mixture was agitated for 5 min under gentle heat until
i was totally dissolved. the mixture was allowed to react
for 15 min after which it was reﬂuxed at 68 c for 2 h.
the reaction was cooled to room temperature (22 c). to
the reaction was added 100 ll of anhydrous  xxxd2052xxx 
that was then removed by rotary evaporation. to the residue was added 16.17 mg (0.03945 mmol) methyl reserpate
(iii) in 200 ll pyridine. this mixture was vortexed until
clear and allowed to react at room temperature for 19 h
while stirring. after this time, 3 ml of water was added
which resulted in the formation of a sticky brown precipi-

tate. this mixture was vortexed for about 5 min. the precipitate was washed three times with 0.5 ml water and
dissolved in 2 ml chloroform. the chloroform was backextracted once with 0.5 ml water and removed by rotary
evaporation leaving an oily residue. the residue was
washed three times with 0.5 ml of anhydrous  xxxd2052xxx ,
which was removed each time by rotary evaporation. this
resulted in a brown powder that migrated on thin-layer
chromatography with an rf of 0.40 in isopropanol:ethyl
acetate:acetic acid (15:10:0.5). this material was puriﬁed
using a 2 · 29-cm silica gel column (70–230 mesh, 60å
pores) and the solvent system described above. the puriﬁed
product was dissolved in 15 ml of cold methanol; 15 ml of
cold water was added and the solution was lyophilized to
yield 17.6 mg of iv (69% yield). analysis by silica gel
tlc developed in isopropanol : ethyl acetate:acetic acid
(15:10:0.5) yielded one spot (rf = 0.40). nmr shifts

synthesis of 18-o-bromoacetyl methyl reserpate (bamer)
(v, scheme 2). bromoacetylbromide (12 ll, 0.122 mmol)
was dissolved in 250 ll of tetrahydrofuran (thf). this
solution was added dropwise to 25 mg (0.061 mmol) of
methyl reserpate in 250 ll thf containing 0.122 mmol of
pyridine. the reaction was stirred vigorously for 15 h, adding thf as necessary to keep the heavy precipitate in suspension. water (3 ml) was added to the reaction to dissolve
the precipitate. the mixture was then extracted three times
with 3 ml dichloromethane which was removed by rotary
evaporation. the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate:methanol (15:1) and v was isolated using a 2.5 · 33cm silica gel column (70–230 mesh, 60å pore size) eluted
with ethyl acetate:methanol (15:1). the solvent was
removed by rotary evaporation. the residue was dissolved
in 10 ml cold methanol. cold water (10 ml) was added and
the product was lyophilized to yield 18.9 mg (70%) of
bromoacetyl methyl reserpate. this product was homogeneous as determined by silica gel tlc developed in ethyl
acetate:methanol (15:1). v migrated with an rf = 0.45

(vii, scheme 2). iapa (vi), 3-iodo-4-azidophenethylamine (10.55 mg, 0.0366 mmol), synthesized by the procedure of resek and ruoho [34], was dissolved in 100 ll
thf and added to 5 mg v (0.0094 mmol) in 100 ll thf.
the reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 hr at room temperature. vii was puriﬁed using a 2.5 · 25-cm silica gel column (70–230 mesh, 60 å pores) eluted with ethyl

radiosynthesis of [125i]iapeglymer
carrier-free [125i]iapa (2200 ci/mmol) was synthesized
following the procedure of resek and ruoho [34].the
[125i]iapa was stored in ethyl acetate at a concentration
of 1 mci/ml. to 1 ml of the [125i]iapa solution was added
50 ll of v (2 mg/ml) in dimethylformamide (dmf). the
solvent was removed under a stream of argon. upon com-

(ix, scheme 3). the diacetate salt of ethylenediamine was
synthesized by neutralizing 2 ml of ethylenediamine with
dilute acetic acid. water was added (about 50 ml) and the
solution lyophilized to give a tan powder. this material
was dried in a vacuum dessicator over p2o5 for several days
together with  xxxd3330xxx  and nacnbh3.  xxxd3330xxx 
(viii, 100 mg, 0.315 mmol) was dissolved in 5 ml of dry
methanol (dried over 4 å molecular sieves). to this was
added 567.4 mg (3.15 mmol) of the diacetate salt of ethylenediamine. this solution was allowed to stand in the presence
of 4 å molecular sieves for 15 min after which nacnbh3
(99.0 mg, 1.58 mmol) was added. the reaction was complete
after 3 h as indicated by tlc, monitoring the disappearance
of viii. the product migrated with an rf of 0.32 in methanol:ethylacetate:ammonium hydroxide (1:1:0.1) and was
reactive to ninhydrin. the reaction mixture was taken to
ph 3 with 1 n hcl to destroy the excess nacnbh3 and then
neutralized with 1 n naoh. the reaction mixture was then
taken to dryness on a rotary evaporator and the ph raised to
9–10 with 1 n naoh, at which time a white precipitate
formed. the solution was extracted four times with 10 ml
of ethyl acetate, which was subsequently dried using anhydrous  xxxd2534xxx . the volume was reduced to approximately
5 ml and streaked onto a 20 · 20-cm thick-layer silica plate.
the material that migrated with an rf of approximately 0.3
was removed from the plate and the silica gel was extracted
four times with 10 ml of methanol. the product was homogeneous as indicated by one spot in tlc analysis in the

radiosynthesis of [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp
[125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp was synthesized by the same procedure as
above except that [125i]aipps was used. carrier-free
[125i]aipps was synthesized according to the procedure of
lowndes et al. [32]. brieﬂy, 50 ll of ix (1 mg/ml in methanol) was added to 500 lci of [125i]aipps in ethyl acetate
(volume 1–3 ml). this solution was dried under a stream of
argon, and an additional 100 ll of ix (1 mg/ml in methanol)
was immediately added. this mixture was allowed to react
overnight at room temperature. the methanol was streaked
onto a 10 · 20-cm thin-layer silica gel plate and developed in

ethyl acetate:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (1:1:0.05).
the tlc plate was subjected to autoradiography for 10 s.
the autoradiogram showed two products (rf=0.35 and
0.40), corresponding to the nonradioactive material synthesized above. the products were extracted separately from the
silica three times with 1 ml methanol to yield 200 and 100 lci
of trans- and cis-[125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp, respectively. the trans[125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp (lower isomer) was used for photoaﬃnity
labeling experiments.
preparation of bovine chromaﬃn granule ghosts
chromaﬃn granule ghosts were prepared from bovine
adrenal medulla as described by smith and winkler [35],
except that 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm hepes/naoh, ph 7.0,
was used as the isolation medium. ghosts were prepared

reserpine and  xxxd3330xxx  photoaﬃnity labels / m.k. sievert et al. / anal. biochem. 367 (2007) 68–78

by lysing and resealing chromaﬃn granules according to
the method of giraudat et al. [36]. brieﬂy, 50–150 whole
bovine adrenals from freshly slaughtered animals were collected at peck’s slaughter house in milwaukee, wi. the
adrenal glands were bisected and the medullae scraped
out and put into ice-cold 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm hepes,
ph 7.0. the medullae were minced in a polytron for 3 s
on a high setting and then homogenized with a teﬂon pestle. after removal of the unbroken cells and nuclei, the
chromaﬃn granule membranes were pelleted through 1.6
m sucrose at 100,000g for 60 min. chromaﬃn granule
ghosts were prepared by osmotically lysing these crude
granules in 5 mm hepes, 2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 10 mm cacl2,
0.1 mm dtt, ph 7.5. the membranes were recovered by
centrifugation at 100,000 g for 60 min. the granules were
resealed by resuspending the pellets in 0.3 m sucrose, 10
mm hepes, 2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.1 mm dtt, ph 7.0, at a concentration of 5–10 mg/ml, snap frozen in liquid n2, and
stored at 80 c until further use.
[3h]dopamine transport into bovine chromaﬃn granule
ghosts
[3h]dopamine uptake was assayed by collecting the granule membranes on cellulose acetate ﬁlters under vacuum ﬁltration according to the published methods of knoth et al.
[37]. brieﬂy, chromaﬃn granule ghosts (280 lg protein) were
diluted in 1.0 ml of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.0,
containing 5 mm atp, 2.5 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and the indicated
concentration of reserpine, bamer, iapeglymer,
aippmer,  xxxd3330xxx , or trans- xxxd3330xxx -aipp added from a 100x
stock solution in dmso. transport was initiated by the

granule ghosts were incubated for 10 min at 30 c and collected on cellulose acetate ﬁlters (millipore type hawp;
0.45 lm pore size) by vacuum ﬁltration. the ﬁlters were
washed three times with 4 ml ice-cold 0.3 m sucrose, 10
mm hepes, ph 7.0. the [3h]dopamine on the ﬁlters was
quantitated using liquid scintillation spectroscopy. uptake
in the presence of vehicle (dmso) alone was deﬁned as
100% and uptake in the presence of 10 lm reserpine in
dmso was deﬁned as 0%. curves were ﬁt to a one-site competitive displacement curve using nonlinear regression with
the software application, graphpad prism.
inhibition of [3h]serotonin transport
transport of [3h]serotonin was done according to the
method of parti et al. [38]. brieﬂy, chromaﬃn granule
ghosts (265 lg protein) were suspended in 1.0 ml of 0.3 m
sucrose, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.0, containing 5 mm atp,
2.5 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and the indicated concentration of inhibitor (iapeglymer or aippmer). transport was initiated by the addition of [3h]serotonin to the indicated
ﬁnal concentration. samples were collected by vacuum ﬁltration after incubation at 30 c for 10 min. filters were
washed three times with 4 ml of ice-cold 0.3 m sucrose,

chromaﬃn granule membranes (150 to 250 lg of protein)
in 0.1 ml of 0.40 m sucrose, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.0, were incubated in thick-walled pyrex tubes at 30 c for 15 min with 2.5

10 mm atp, 10 mm mgcl2, and inhibitor, when required.

thick-walled pyrex tubes at 30 c for 90 min with 2 nm
[125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp in the presence and absence of 10 lm
 xxxd3330xxx . after the incubation, the membranes were diluted with
5 ml of ice-cold 0.22 m kcl, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.0, and
immediately photolyzed for 5 s in ice-water at a distance of
10 cm from a water-jacketed 1-kw high-pressure ah-6 mercury lamp [39]. for the experiments using the biogenic
amines as inhibitors of photoaﬃnity labeling, the amines
were present in the dilution buﬀer at their indicated concentration.  xxxd26xxx  (50 ll) was added after photolysis to help reduce the nonspeciﬁc labeling. the membranes
were then collected by centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 min
at 4 c for analysis by sds–page. dried, stained gels were
subjected to autoradiography using kodak x-omat ﬁlm to
visualize photolabel incorporation.
reserpine inhibition of [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp photolabeling
chromaﬃn granule membranes were preincubated in
the presence and absence of 1 lm reserpine prior to incubation with 2 nm [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp. chromaﬃn granule
membranes (100 lg of protein per condition) were suspended in 0.2 m sucrose, 40 mm hepes, ph 8.0, in the
presence and absence of 10 mm atp and 10 mm mgcl2
for 15 min at 30 c. after the incubation, reserpine (ﬁnal
concentration 1 lm) was added to one of the atp samples and one of the +atp samples.  xxxd3330xxx  was also added to
one of the +atp samples. the samples were incubated
again for 15 min at 30 c. at this time [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp
was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 nm. all other samples were prepared in an identical manner except that they
were not pretreated prior to the addition of reserpine or
[125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp. the samples were then incubated for
90 min at 30 c and then photolyzed as described above.

bamer, iapeglymer, aippmer, reserpine,
 xxxd3330xxx , and  xxxd3330xxx -aipp inhibit [3h]dopamine uptake
the transport of biogenic amines into chromaﬃn granules was examined using resealed chromaﬃn granule
ghosts. reserpine has been shown to be a potent inhibitor
of catecholamine uptake into chromaﬃn granule ghosts
with a ki = 0.5 nm [25]. bamer, iapeglymer, and
aippmer inhibit the transport of [3h]dopamine into
bovine chromaﬃn granule ghosts, although at a 2- to 5fold higher ic50 than reserpine (table 1).
lineweaver–burk analysis of the iapeglymer and
aippmer inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)
uptake into bovine chromaﬃn granule ghosts demonstrates
that iapeglymer and aippmer are both competitive
inhibitors of serotonin uptake into chromaﬃn granule
ghosts (fig. 1). the ki for iapeglymer was calculated
to be approximately 90 nm, and the ki for aippmer
was calculated to be approximately 40 nm, 180 and 80
times lower aﬃnity, respectively, than reserpine.

[ i]iapeglymer was synthesized carrier-free
(2200 ci/mmol) and used as a photoaﬃnity label for the
reserpine binding site on vmat2. a 15-h autoradiogram
(fig. 2a) of the sds–polyacrylamide gel showed several
bands of labeled proteins; however, only a broad band of
apparent molecular mass 55–90 kda was completely
blocked in the presence of 1 lm reserpine, with the majority of the label located at approximately 70–80 kda.  xxxd3330xxx  at a concentration of 10 lm partially blocked the
photolabeling by 2.5 nm [125i]iapeglymer; however, if
the  xxxd3330xxx  concentration was increased to 100 lm, the inhibition of photoaﬃnity labeling was complete. the speciﬁcally labeled protein is not a major protein in the
chromaﬃn granule membrane as can be observed by a
comparison of the sds–page gel and the autoradiogram.

labeling [26,43].

the inhibition of photolabeling is complete regardless of
whether the membranes are preincubated with reserpine
or whether reserpine and [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp are added simultaneously. reserpine completely blocks the labeling of
vmat2 by [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp in the absence of atp.
discussion
arylazido derivatives of  xxxd3330xxx  ([3h]tba) [41],
 xxxd2419xxx  ([125i]azik) [42], and serotonin ([3h]anpa5ht) [44] have been previously reported as photoaﬃnity
labels for  xxxg2099xxx . the  xxxd3330xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx  compounds photolabeled a 70- to 80- kda polypeptide in chromaﬃn granule membranes, while the serotonin photolabel
derivatized a 45-kda polypeptide, also in bovine chromafﬁn granule membranes, that the authors concluded to be
either  xxxg2099xxx  or  xxxg220xxx  of the transporter. it is possible
that this 45-kda protein represents a unique or altered
form of  xxxg2099xxx  (i.e., nonglycosylated or partially

fig. 4. reserpine inhibition of [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp photolabeling of chromaﬃn granule membranes. chromaﬃn granule membranes (100 lg of
protein per condition) were photolabeled with [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp after
preincubation (a–e) or no preincubation (f–j) with the inhibitors. lanes a

proteolyzed) or a  xxxg2099xxx -associated protein. reserpine
photolabels have not been reported to date, and the ﬁrst
successful reserpine photolabel is presented in this report,
along with a carrier-free radioiodinated  xxxd3330xxx 
derivative. our laboratory has now successfully synthesized
several iodophenylazide derivatives of reserpine and  xxxd3330xxx  that inhibit the transport of [3h]dopamine into
chromaﬃn granule ghosts. iapeglymer and  xxxd3330xxx -aipp
have been prepared carrier-free (2200 ci/mmol) in radioiodinated form and both compounds speciﬁcally photolabel
 xxxg2099xxx  in chromaﬃn granule membranes.
while all the reserpine derivatives reported in this
paper inhibited [3h]dopamine uptake into chromaﬃn
granule ghosts, all did so with lower potency than reserpine. from the inhibition of [3h]dopamine uptake into
chromaﬃn granule ghosts, the ic50 values for bamer,
aippmer, and iapeglymer were approximately 100–
200 nm. additionally, when aippmer and iapegly-

mer were analyzed using a lineweaver–burk plot for
their inhibition of [3h]serotonin uptake (fig. 1), the ki
values determined in this experiment were 90 nm for
iapeglymer and 40 nm for aippmer. the ic50 values for reserpine and the reserpine derivatives are higher
than expected, which may be due to the fact that the
chromaﬃn granule ghosts were not preincubated with
the inhibitors prior to the addition of [3h]dopamine.
these data indicate that bamer, iapeglymer, and
aippmer are competitive inhibitors of serotonin uptake
by bovine vmat2.
in the presence of either 1 lm reserpine or 100 lm  xxxd3330xxx , a polypeptide that migrated with an apparent
molecular weight of 55–90 kda was speciﬁcally labeled
by [125i]iapeglymer. from the autoradiogram (fig. 2),
it can be seen that the majority of the labeling is in the
molecular weight range of 70–80 kda, a molecular weight
that is consistent with vmat2. this molecular weight
agrees with previous reports of the  xxxg2099xxx  photoaﬃnity
labels [125i]azik [42] and [3h]tba [41]; however it is larger than the polypeptide labeled by the serotonin photoaﬃnity label, [3h] xxxg1587xxx -5ht [44].
the [125i]iapeglymer-labeled transporter migrates as
a diﬀuse band on sds–polyacrylamide gels, consistent with
the glycoprotein nature of  xxxg2099xxx . indeed, when the tbzaipp-labeled transporter (which also migrates as a diﬀuse
band) is digested by an endoglycosidase, it migrates with an
apparent molecular weight of 53 (data not shown). the
nonspeciﬁc labeling observed with [125i]iapeglymer is
likely due to the hydrophobic nature of the photoaﬃnity
label. several techniques, including washing the membranes prior to photolysis, washing with bovine serum
albumin, and photolysis in the presence of  xxxd26xxx  were used to try to reduce this nonspeciﬁc labeling. none of these techniques increased the speciﬁc labeling
with respect to the background radioactivity. this nonspeciﬁc binding is also seen in [3h]reserpine binding studies
[25] and with the photolabel [3h]tba, a  xxxd3330xxx 
derivative [41].
the transporter substrates, norepinephrine, dopamine,
and serotonin, were also used to block the labeling seen
with [125i]iapeglymer (fig. 2). partial inhibition of
vmat2 photoaﬃnity labeling was observed with 1 mm
serotonin and full inhibition of photolabeling required
the presence of 10 mm biogenic amines. the observation
that high concentrations of the substrates are needed to
obtain inhibition of [125i]iapeglymer-labeling is consistent with reports of the biogenic amines being poor inhibitors of [3h]reserpine binding [45].
the photolabeling of the  xxxg2099xxx  from
bovine chromaﬃn granule membranes with [125i]tbzaipp was blocked by 10 lm  xxxd3330xxx  and 1lm reserpine.
interestingly, reserpine blocked labeling both in the presence and in the absence of atp. it has been proposed that
there are two conformations of the transporter, r and t,
and each conformation binds only one type of ligand,
reserpine or  xxxd3330xxx , respectively. the r conformation is

reserpine and  xxxd3330xxx  photoaﬃnity labels / m.k. sievert et al. / anal. biochem. 367 (2007) 68–78

dependent on the presence of a proton gradient and is
believed to be the conformation that binds reserpine with
high aﬃnity and transports substrates across the membrane. the t conformation binds  xxxd3330xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx . the  xxxd3330xxx -aipp photolabeling in the presence of atp
demonstrates that the r conformation state can bind  xxxd3330xxx .
the amount of photolabeling in the presence of atp is
decreased, which may indicate that a population of transporters exists in the t conformation state, even though
there is atp present. the fact that reserpine inhibits
[125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp photolabeling in the absence of atp indicates that reserpine can bind to the  xxxd3330xxx  binding
conformation, in apparent conﬂict with the proposed
model of darchen et al. [24].
initial experiments have been performed to identify
the  xxxd3330xxx  binding site peptide [30] utilizing vmat2
expressed and puriﬁed using the baculovirus-expression
system [46].  xxxd3330xxx -aipp inserts into two regions of the
transporter, the n terminus and a region composed of
the cytoplasmic portions of transmembrane domains 10
and 11. the decrease in the amount of [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp
insertion into vmat2 in the presence of atp may indicate a conformational change in either of these regions,
which is ‘‘sensed’’ by the photoactive moiety when the
vesicles are charged with a proton gradient.  xxxd3330xxx  binding is not aﬀected by the presence of a proton
gradient; therefore, it is possible that a conformational
change in vmat2 in which the [125i] xxxd3330xxx -aipp photoinsertion site is changed or moved could account for the
decrease in labeling in the presence of atp. this is in
contrast to a change in aﬃnity for the photoaﬃnity label
itself. there is a report that the n terminus of the  xxxg2137xxx ,  xxxg2143xxx , is involved in regulating
 xxxg2143xxx  transport activity (it activates transport through
an intramolecular interaction) [47]. it can be speculated
that a similar mechanism may be occurring in vmat2,
whereby the n terminus, a site of photoinsertion by
 xxxd3330xxx -aipp [30], is restructured upon the generation of
a proton gradient and, thus, less  xxxd3330xxx -aipp is
incorporated.
to summarize, we report the synthesis of a reserpine
and a  xxxd3330xxx  photoaﬃnity label and demonstrate
that these photoaﬃnity labels speciﬁcally derivatize
vmat2 in chromaﬃn granule membranes. the reserpine
photoaﬃnity label will provide a tool with which to probe
the reserpine binding site and determine whether conformational changes occur in vmat2 upon activation by
the proton gradient, a hypothesis supported by the fact
that  xxxd3330xxx -aipp labeling is decreased in the presence of
atp.
