abstract
background: clinical studies suggest a survival advantage in cancer patients receiving
 xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh). a suggested mechanism for this beneficial effect
may reside in the antiangiogenic activity of heparins.
objectives: in this study we investigated whether two different lmwhs, i.e. enoxaparin
and  xxxd1805xxx , and unfractionated heparin (ufh), affect the angiogenic potential of
human microvascular endothelial cells (hmec-1) promoted by tumor cells.
methods: hmec-1 cells were incubated with tumor cell conditioned media (tcm) derived
from human breast cancer and leukemic cells (i.e. mcf-7, mda.mb.231, and nb4 cell
lines) or recombinant cytokines (i.e. vegf,  xxxg787xxx , tnf-alpha) ±heparins. capillary-like
tube formation in matrigel and cell proliferation were evaluated.
results: all three tcm induced a significant (p b 0.05) increase in total length of tubes
formed by hmec-1 in matrigel. these increases were significantly counteracted (62 to
100% mean inhibition) by enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx , but were significantly less affected
by ufh. similarly, the tube formation induced by standard vegf,  xxxg787xxx , or tnf-alpha was
100% inhibited by enoxaparin, and 70–90% by  xxxd1805xxx , whereas minor or no inhibition

was observed with ufh. vegf was the most active cytokine in tcm of both breast cancer
and leukemic cells. ec proliferation was significantly increased by standard angiogenic
factors, and slightly affected by breast cancer tcm (p = ns). the addition of heparins
significantly counteracted the proliferative stimuli.
conclusions: these results support a major role for lmwh compared to ufh in inhibiting
the proangiogenic effect exerted by tumor cells or purified angiogenic factors on
microvascular endothelium.

introduction
low molecular weight heparins (lmwh) are glycosaminoglycans used in clinical practice for the
prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism [1]. they exert anticoagulant effects by
accelerating the rate of inhibition of coagulation
 xxxg741xxx  and thrombin by binding to antithrombin.
in clinical studies of thrombosis, an advantage in
survival was shown in patients with cancer receiving lmwh, and these findings could not be
explained solely by the prevention of venous
thromboembolism [2]. recently, the results of
prospective randomized clinical trials specifically
addressing the effect of lmwh on survival in
patients with cancer, suggest a role for these
drugs in cancer care, particularly in the early stages
of the disease [3–6]. the possible mechanisms of
lmwh interference with cancer biology are currently under investigation [7]. they may involve the
inhibition of both coagulation-dependent and noncoagulation-dependent pathways of tumor progression [8–10]. among the latter, an important role has
been attributed to the action(s) of heparins on neoangiogenesis, i.e. the formation of new blood
vessels from the host's existing vascular bed,
which supports the expansion of a tumor and the
formation of metastasis. the angiogenesis is a complex process constituted by multiple steps. it begins
with the degradation of the basement membrane by
proteases secreted by activated endothelial cells
that will migrate and proliferate, leading to the
formation of solid endothelial cell sprouts into the
stromal space. then, vascular loops are formed
and capillary tubes develop with formation of
tight junctions and deposition of new basement
membrane.
it has been observed that heparins can inhibit
capillary tube formation by human endothelial cells
(ec) from the macrovascular bed (i.e. huvec)
stimulated by standard proangiogenic factors [i.e.
fibroblast growth factor-2 ( xxxg787xxx ) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf)], and that the
heparin inhibitory capacity is dependent on the
molecular weight of heparins used [11]. furthermore, it has been shown that heparins can affect

angiogenesis by modulating the binding of angiogenic growth factors to their cell receptors [12].
however, no studies have evaluated so far the
interference of heparins on angiogenesis promoted
by tumor cell derived products.
therefore, in this study, we explored for the first
time the effect of heparins on the interaction of
tumor cells with human microvascular ec on two
steps of angiogenesis: the ec proliferation and the
capillary-tube formation by the matrigel assay,
which evaluates the final differentiation of ec into
capillary-like tubular structures.
we used ec of microvascular origin (i.e. hmec-1)
because: 1. this is the ec type mainly involved in
clinically relevant angiogenesis capillary sprouting
in vivo [13,14], and 2. no in vitro studies have
been performed so far to evaluate the effect of
heparins on the angiogenesis of human microvascular ec in a matrigel-based assay. in our experimental
system, the endothelial capillary formation was
induced by two human breast cancer cell lines (i.e.
mda.mb-231 and mcf-7 cell lines), characterized by
different expression of vegf and metastatic potential in vivo, and by a human leukemic cell line (i.e.
nb4) with well characterized procoagulant and
proangiogenic properties [15–17]. three heparins,
largely utilized for the prevention and treatment of
thrombosis in human subjects (including cancer
patients), with different molecular weights and
methods of preparation [i.e., two lmwh,  xxxd1805xxx 
and enoxaparin, and an unfractionated heparin
(ufh)] have been selected for the study.
materials and methods
drugs
heparins used in this study were two lmwh, i.e.  xxxd1805xxx  sodium
( xxxd1805xxx ®, gift of pfizer, rome, italy; mean mw 6.0 kda) and enoxaparin sodium ( xxxd1997xxx ®, gift of aventis, milan, italy; mean mw
4.5 kda), and a sodium unfractionated heparin (“ufh”, vister®,
parke-davis, lainate, milan, italy; mean mw 15.0 kda). the two
lmwh are produced by the depolymerization of heparin derived from
porcine mucosa. particularly,  xxxd1805xxx  is prepared by benzylation
and alkaline hydrolysis, and enoxaparin by nitrous acid depolymerization. the three heparins were in the form of their respective
commercially available pharmaceutical products. the heparins were

heparins and tumor angiogenesis
used at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 iu/ml, chosen on the basis of
the therapeutic dose range utilized in clinics.

endothelial cell culture
human microvascular endothelial cells (hmec-1) (kind gift from dr.
f.j. candal, centers for disease control and prevention, atlanta,
ga, u.s.a.), were grown in rpmi1640 medium (gibco, gaithersburg,
md, u.s.a.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (fbs, gibco),
2 mm l-glutamine (gibco), 10 ng/ml  xxxg681xxx  (icn,
costa mesa, ca, u.s.a.) and 1 mug/ml hydrocortisone (icn), and
maintained in a 5% co2/95% air atmosphere in a humidified
incubator (heraeus, milan, italy) at 37 °c [18]. confluent monolayers of hmec-1 were passaged by trypsin/edta treatment (0.25%
trypsin-edta solution, life technologies, inc., rockville, md, usa) at
a 1:3 split ratio.

tumor cell culture and tumor cell conditioned
medium (tcm) preparation
breast cancer conditioned media were obtained from two human
cell lines, i.e. mda.mb-231 and mcf-7, purchased from the american
type culture collection (atcc; manassas, va, usa). mda.mb-231
cells (atcc cat. #htb-26), originally isolated from the pleural
effusion of a 51-years female with adenocarcinoma [19], have a
fibroblastic phenotype, are  xxxg730xxx  negative (er-), and
are highly metastatic in vivo as established in mice [20].
mcf-7 cells (atcc cat. #htb-22) have an epithelial phenotype,
are er positive (er+) and are low metastatic in vivo [21,22].
breast cancer cells were grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's
medium (dmem, gibco) supplemented with 10% fbs, 2 mm lglutamine, 100 iu/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin and 1%
non-essential amino acids (gibco), in t75 flasks (becton dickinson,
mountain view, ca, usa), where they adhere to the plastic bottom
forming a monolayer. at 100% confluence of cell monolayer, culture
medium was removed, cells were washed three times with rpmi1640
and incubated with 10 ml serum-free rpmi1640 plus 2 mm lglutamine. after 24 h incubation, tcm were collected, centrifuged
for 10 min at 16,000 ×g to eliminate cell debris, then the
supernatants were collected, 0.22 mum-filtered, and stored at
−40 °c until assayed.
human  xxxg1785xxx  nb4 cell line, established in
vitro from an apl patient, was a kind gift from dr. m. lanotte
(inserm unit 301, st louis hospital, paris, france) and grown in
suspension in rpmi1640 containing 10% fbs, 2 mm l-glutamine,
100 iu/ml penicillin and 100 mug/ml streptomycin [15]. for the
preparation of tcm, nb4 cells were collected, washed three times in
rpmi1640, counted and resuspended at 500,000 cells/ml in serumfree rpmi1640 plus 2 mm l-glutamine. after 24 h incubation, the
cells were sedimented by centrifugation (1500 g for 5 min), and tcm
collected and processed as described above for breast cancer cells.
trypan blue exclusion dye test was used to determine hmec-1 as
well as tumor cells viability. only cell cultures with more than 95% of
viable cells were used for the subsequent experiments.

capillary-like tubule formation in matrigel
a matrigel-based capillary-genesis assay was performed on hmec-1
to assess the ability of these cells to form an organized tubular
network [23]. the day before the experiment, confluent hmec-1
were starved overnight at 37 °c with rpmi 1640 medium containing
1% fbs. growth factor-reduced matrigel® (becton dickinson) was
thawed overnight at 4 °c on ice and, the day of the assay, plated on
the bottom of 96 well-plates, and left at 37 °c for 1 h for gelification.
starved hmec-1 were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25%

639
trypsin-edta solution), counted and resuspended in rpmi1640
medium containing 0.5% fbs (f.c.). then, 10,000 cell/well were
seeded on matrigel and incubated at 37 °c and 5% co2 in a humidified
atmosphere with tcm, or the following purified recombinant human
angiogenic factors: 50 ng/ml  xxxg1608xxx , 100 ng/ml  xxxg787xxx  and 100 ng/
ml tnf-alpha (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn), in either the
presence or in the absence of increasing doses of each heparin
(i.e. 0.01–0.1–1 iu/ml). each treatment was performed in
triplicate. after 24 h at 37 °c tubule formation was examined
under an inverted light microscope (zeiss, model 471202, germany)
at 100× magnification (objective lens numerical aperture=0.22).
digital images were obtained using a video camera system
(photosmart 318, hewlett packard) along with the microscope.
three images were randomly taken in different areas of the well,
selecting those areas that were distinct and distant enough to not
overlap each other, and then quantified by two observers blinded to
treatment group. the total length of connected cells forming tubular
structures on the matrigel surface was measured using the resulting
images. total tube length was determined by an image analysis
software (image j, national institutes of health, bethesda, md,
usa). results are expressed as mm tube length/cm2 area. in some
experiments, tcm were incubated for 2 h at 37 °c prior to their use in
the matrigel assay with the following neutralizing antibodies:
polyclonal antihuman  xxxg1608xxx  (2.5 mug/ml, r&d systems), monoclonal antihuman tnf-alpha (4 ng/ml, r&d systems), and monoclonal
antihuman  xxxg787xxx  (50 mug/ml, upstate, lake placid, ny, usa). to
optimize the antibody concentrations we conducted preliminary
dose–response experiments with standard cytokines (data not
shown). capillary formation induced by standard angiogenic factors
was completely inhibited by the respective neutralizing antibodies.
neutralizing antibodies alone did not affect endothelial cell tube
formation (data not shown).

ec proliferation
ec proliferation was evaluated using the crystal violet staining
method as described [24]. hmec-1 were seeded in 96-well plates at
the concentration of 10,000 cells/well. a calibration curve was
prepared by seeding in duplicate the cells at the concentrations of
5,000, 7,500, 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 cells/well: a series was
utilized for crystal violet staining and the other for the trypan blue
exclusion dye test. the cells were allowed to adhere and starved for
24 h in rpmi1640 medium at 1% fbs. the medium was then removed
and hmec-1 were incubated with rpmi1640 medium (control cell
wells and calibration curve wells) or tcm (12.5% f.c. in rpmi1640
medium+fbs 0.5%), in the presence or absence of enoxaparin,
 xxxd1805xxx  or ufh. after 24 h of incubation, the wells were washed
three times with phosphate buffered saline (pbs; ph 7.4), and fixed
with 3% paraformaldehyde (sigma) for 10 min. plates were washed
three times with pbs, emptied and then allowed to dry by air. then,
75 mul of crystal violet dye (0.5% in h2o) was added to each well. after
5 min incubation, plates were rinsed extensively with pbs, and then
100 mul of 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% ethanol was added. after crystal
violet solubilization, the absorbance at 540 nm wavelength was read
by a multiskan ascent reader (titertek, huntsville, al, usa). the
calibration curve was constructed by plotting the cell counts
obtained by trypan blue exclusion dye test vs the correspondent
optical densities (o.d.) obtained with the crystal violet assay.

tcm cytokine quantification by elisa
tcm were assayed for the presence of the pro-angiogenic factors
 xxxg1608xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , and tnf-alpha by commercially available elisa kits,
i.e. human  xxxg2413xxx  and human tnf-alpha elisas by bendermedsystems (vienna, austria), and human  xxxg787xxx  elisa by chemicon

640
international (temecula, ca, usa). elisas were performed according
to the respective manufacturers' instructions. results are expressed
as ng (tnf-alpha) or pg (vegf and  xxxg787xxx ) per ml of tcm, and
represent the mean±sd of 30 different tcm samples (i.e. collected in
different days) for each tumor cell line.

statistical analysis
the results are reported as mean ±sd of at least five independent
experiments. student's paired and unpaired t-test was used for the
determination of significance levels between the different treatments. differences were considered statistically significant when
p b 0.05.

results
tcm-induced formation of capillary-like tube
structures in matrigel
hmec-1 seeded on matrigel invaded the underlying gel and formed
capillary-like tube structures. in the presence of control medium
alone, minor cell organization was observed and the mean overall
length of tubular structures was 247± 23 mm/cm2.
to evaluate whether products released by tumor cells may also
affect tube formation in this experimental system, tcm collected
from human breast cancer cell lines, mcf-7 (er+) and mda.mb-231
(er−), and from the nb4  xxxg1785xxx  cell line, were
serially diluted with control medium (from 75 to 1.56% f.c.) and
added to hmec-1 seeded on matrigel. as shown in fig. 1, tcm from
the three cell lines induced a significant increase in hmec-1 tube
formation starting from 1.56% concentration and reached the
maximum effect at 12.5% concentration of tcm; no further increase
was observed with greater tcm concentrations. particularly, the
total length of the network formed after hmec-1 incubation with
12.5% tcm was: 675 ± 98 mm/cm2 with mda.mb.231, 502
± 66 mm/cm2 with mcf-7, and 708 ± 89 mm/cm2 with nb4, all
p b 0.01 compared with control medium (238 ± 28 mm/cm2).
similarly, a complex network developed in the presence of the
pro-angiogenic factors: vegf (406 ± 59 mm/cm2),  xxxg787xxx  (467 ±
61 mm/cm2), and tnf-alpha (421 ±30 mm/cm2); all p b 0.01 vs
control medium.

enoxaparin (pb 0.01) and 70±6.5% (pb 0.01) by  xxxd1805xxx . finally,
heparins counteracted in a dose-dependent manner tube formation
induced by nb4 leukemic cell tcm (fig. 2c). in this case, enoxaparin
was the most effective drug, by completely preventing the
proangiogenic stimulus at the 1 iu/ml concentration. at this dose,
tube formation induced by nb4-tcm was 100% inhibited by
enoxaparin (pb 0.01), 80±9.3% by  xxxd1805xxx  (pb 0.01) and 44
±5.6% by ufh (pb 0.01); a significant (pb 0.05) difference between
the inhibition produced by either enoxaparin or  xxxd1805xxx  compared
to ufh was also observed. fig. 3 shows photographs of the capillary
tube formation on matrigel from a representative experiment of
heparin effects on tcm-induced capillary network formation.

heparins inhibit tube formation induced by
standard angiogenic factors
a series of experiments were performed to evaluate whether
heparins may affect tube formation induced by standard human
recombinant angiogenic factors. for this purpose, hmec-1 were
incubated for 24 h with vegf,  xxxg787xxx  or tnf-alpha in either the
presence or absence of each heparin (f.c. 1 iu/ml).
as shown in fig. 4, all the heparins significantly inhibited
capillary tube formation induced by the three standard proangiogenic factors. however, the inhibitions achieved with the two lmwh
were significantly higher than with ufh. indeed, both enoxaparin
and  xxxd1805xxx  100% and 90 ±7.5% counteracted capillary tube
formation induced by vegf (p b 0.01), 100% and 70 ±8.2% by  xxxg787xxx 
( p b 0.01), and 100% and 75 ± 7.4% by tnf-alpha ( p b 0.01),
respectively. differently, ufh inhibited by 28 ± 4.8%, 33 ±
5.2% and 36 ± 4.4% (all p b 0.05) the capillary tube formation
induced by vegf,  xxxg787xxx  and tnf-alpha, respectively.

heparins inhibit tube formation induced
by tcm
subsequently, we studied the effect of heparins on tcm-induced
capillary network formation. hmec-1 were incubated for 24 h with
control medium or tcm (12.5% f.c.) in the presence of increasing
concentrations of each heparin (i.e. 0.01, 0.1, 1 iu/ml), then tube
formation was evaluated. as shown in fig. 2, the three heparins
affected the capillary formation induced by either breast or
leukemic cell tcms to different extents. mda.mb.231-tcm-induced
capillary formation was dose-dependently inhibited by the three
heparins (fig. 2a). in particular, at the heparin concentration of
1 iu/ml, the observed inhibitions (mean±sd) were: 35±6.3% by ufh
(p b 0.01), 81 ± 8.4% by enoxaparin (p b 0.01) and 75± 8.8% by
 xxxd1805xxx  (pb 0.01). at this concentration, the inhibitory effect of
ufh was significantly (pb 0.05) lower than that of the two lmwh.
similarly, the mcf-7 tcm-induced tube formation was also dosedependently inhibited by heparins (fig. 2b). in the range of drug
concentrations between 0.01 and 1 iu/ml, the inhibitory effect of
ufh was significantly lower than that of both lmwh; specifically, at
the heparin concentration of 1 iu/ml, mcf-7 tcm induced-tube
formation was 29±4.1% inhibited by ufh (pb 0.05), 62±7.2% by

figure 1 tcm induce hmec-1 capillary-like tubule formation.
hmec-1 were exposed to increasing concentrations of tcm
obtained from the two breast cancer cell lines (mda.mb.231 and
mcf-7) and from the leukemic nb4 cell line. after 24 h
incubation, tube formation was quantified. for all three types
of tcm, the maximum proangiogenic activity peaked at the
12.5% concentration. data are reported as the mean± sd of 5
different experiments, each performed in duplicate. ⁎ = p b 0.05

heparins and tumor angiogenesis

characterization of tcm growth factor content
in order to identify the possible mediators of angiogenesis contained
in breast cancer and leukemia cell tcm, quantitative assays (elisa)
for the main angiogenic factors, i.e. vegf,  xxxg787xxx  and tnf-alpha,
were performed. tcm from breast cancer cells contained significantly (pb 0.05) higher levels of vegf (mda.mb.231: 956 ± 87 pg/
ml, mcf-7: 647 ±
70 pg/ml) compared to nb4-tcm (293± 44 pg/ml). all tcm were
negative for the presence of  xxxg787xxx . no tnf-alpha was detected in
breast cancer cell tcm, whereas a very small amount of this cytokine
was found in nb4-tcm (9.3± 2.7 pg/ml). neutralizing antibody
against vegf was used in the matrigel assay to evaluate the relative
proangiogenic role of this cytokine. the results show that the  xxxd328xxx  antibody significantly inhibited capillary-tube formation
induced by tcm from mda-mb.231 (98 ±10%; p b 0.01), mcf-7 (85
± 14%; p b 0.01), and nb4 (80 ±18%; p b 0.01) (fig. 5).

hmec-1 proliferation
the effect of tcm and heparins on proliferation of hmec-1 treated
for 24 h with tcm (12.5% f.c.) was explored.  xxxg787xxx , vegf and  xxxg2296xxx  were used as standard factors in this assay. the results (fig. 6)
show that after 24 h incubation, tcm from the two breast cancer cell
lines produced a slight increase in hmec-1 proliferation as compared
with untreated cells (8.5% and 9.2% increase for mda-mb.231 and
mcf-7, respectively; p =n.s.). in contrast, the incubation of hmec-1
with tcm from nb4 cells produced a slight decrease in ec
proliferation compared to control (4.7% decrease; p =n.s.). the
addition of heparins to tcm did not significantly affect cell
proliferation.
after 24 h incubation hmec-1 proliferation was 22% (p b 0.05)
increased by vegf and 30% (p b 0.05) by  xxxg787xxx  (fig. 7), while was
unaffected by tnf-alpha (data not shown). all the three heparins
significantly inhibited cell proliferation induced by vegf and  xxxg787xxx 
in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 7), reaching a 100% inhibition at
the concentration of 1 iu/ml for all heparins. similar results were
obtained after 48 h incubation (data not shown).

discussion
angiogenesis, the formation of new vessels, has a
major role in tumor growth, dissemination and
metastasis in both solid and hematological tumors
[25]. angiogenesis is driven by microvascular ec,
which upon activation by angiogenic growth factors
degrade their basement membrane, migrate into the
interstitial matrix, proliferate, and form new capillary-like structures [14]. the angiogenic switch in
cancer is a highly complex event that involves several
tumor-derived factors. inhibition of angiogenesis is
one of the proposed strategies to control cancer. basic
research and clinical data have shown anticancer
effects of heparins, both ufh and lmwhs, suggesting
a promising role for lmwhs in this setting [7,26].
in the present study we evaluated whether
heparins may affect the angiogenic properties of
microvascular ec exposed to tcm. two different
lmwh, i.e.  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin, and standard
ufh were used. the two lmwh have been selected on
the basis of their different molecular weight range

figure 2 heparins counteract hmec-1 capillary-like tubule
formation induced by tcm. hmec-1 were incubated with tcm
(f.c. = 12.5%) obtained from mda.mb.231 (panel a), mcf-7
(panel b), and nb4 (panel c) cell lines, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of heparins (black square =
ufh, open triangle = enoxaparin, open circle =  xxxd1805xxx ).
after 24 h incubation, tube formation was quantified. data
are mean ± sd of 5 different experiments performed in
duplicate. § = p b 0.05 vs control (c); ⁎ = p b 0.05 vs tcm.

and type of preparations, as these characteristics are
thought to affect their pharmacokinetic and biological
properties [27]. in addition, these two lmwhs have
been widely tested in clinical trials of thromboprophylaxis in patients with and without cancer and,
recently, in clinical studies evaluating the effect on
survival of patients with cancer [26].
our results demonstrate that enoxaparin,  xxxd1805xxx  and ufh can inhibit microvascular ec capillarylike tube formation in matrigel when induced by

642
human breast cancer and leukemia cells. the inhibition is dose-dependent and reaches a maximum effect
with the concentration of 1 iu/ml. in the interval of
heparin concentrations between 0.1 and 1 iu/ml, that
is superimposable to the therapeutic dose range
utilized in clinics, the two lmwh have superior
inhibitory activity compared to ufh.
a number of tumor-derived products may be
potential positive regulators of angiogenesis. our
results indicate an important role for vegf in both
breast cancer and leukemia cell-mediated capillary
formation. indeed, in our experimental conditions, a
vegf-neutralizing antibody mostly abrogated endothelial tube formation induced by the three tcm.
other proangiogenic factors may be released by tumor
cells, i.e.  xxxg787xxx  and tnf-alpha, however, the screening of our tcm for these additional factors did not
reveal significant amounts of these cytokines. in
addition, neutralizing antibodies against these cyto-

m. marchetti et al.
kines did not significantly inhibit tcm-induced angiogenesis. in the same tumor cell model of nb4, others
have shown a major role for vegf contained in the
nb4 tcm in inducing the migration of huvec [17]. a
role of this factor is confirmed also in our model,
which is the first model studying the effect of nb4 cells
on microvascular ec capillary-like tube formation.
it is noteworthy that the most potent tumorderived proangiogenic factors are heparin-binding
proteins. we therefore explored the effect of
heparins on angiogenesis induced by vegf as well as
by other standard proangiogenic factors, i.e.:  xxxg787xxx ,
and tnf-alpha. lmwh significantly inhibited capillary-like tube formation induced by these human
recombinant factors, while a lower inhibitory effect

bovine aortic arch ec, while fragments with mws of
more than 6.9 kda enhance the binding [28]. as a
consequence of the lower mean molecular weight of
the heparin fragments, it is possible that the lmwhs
used in this study might prevent the binding of growth

figure 4 heparins affect hmec-1 tubule formation induced
by standard proangiogenic factors. hmec-1 were incubated
with the standard proangiogenic factors vegf (50 ng/ml),
 xxxg787xxx  (100 ng/ml), and tnf-alpha (100 ng/ml) in the absence
or presence of 1 iu/ml heparins. after 24 h incubation,
capillary like-tubule formation was quantified. data are

and lmwh, are a heterogeneous mixture of glycosaminoglycan chains of different length and molecular
weight. ufh has an average molecular weight of 13 to
15 kda, whereas lmwhs are produced by ufh
depolymerization and have a mean molecular weight
between 3 and 6 kda, depending on the manufacturing process. it has been demonstrated that heparin
fragments with mws of 4.8- to 5.4-kda inhibit the in
vitro binding of  xxxg1608xxx  to its receptors on cultured

capillary-like tubule formation induced by tcm. tcm were preincubated for 2 h in the presence and absence of an antibody
directed against vegf (f.c. = 2.5 mug/ml) at neutralizing concentration, and then used in the angiogenesis assay. after 24 h
incubation, hmec-1 capillary network was quantified. data are
mean± sd of 5 different experiments, each performed in
duplicate. § = p b 0.05 vs control; ⁎ = p b 0.05 vs tcm.

heparins. hmec-1 were exposed to the different tcm (f.c. =
12.5%), in the presence and absence of heparins (black square =
ufh, open triangle = enoxaparin, open circle =  xxxd1805xxx ), and
after 24 h incubation cell proliferation was evaluated. no
significant effect of tcm on hmec-1 proliferation occurred. the
addition of lmwhs or ufh did not induce significant modifications. the results are reported as mean ± sd of 5 different

factors to their receptor on endothelial cells and thus
inhibit their functions [12]. based on these considerations, we can also hypothesize that the lower mean
mw of enoxaparin (4.5 kda) compared to  xxxd1805xxx 
(6.0 kda) should be responsible for the major effect of
enoxaparin over  xxxd1805xxx  in inhibiting capillary
tube formation.
our results are in line with those of other studies
that have explored the effects of heparins on
angiogenesis in different experimental in vivo and in
vitro models. in an animal model of angiogenesis, it
has been shown that  xxxg787xxx - and  xxxg1608xxx -induced
angiogenesis is more suppressed by a lmwh, or
heparins enriched in 2.5 kda and 5.0 kda species,
than by ufh and high-molecular-weight heparins

figure 7 heparins inhibit hmec-1 proliferation induced by
standard growth factors. cell proliferation was evaluated in
hmec-1 exposed for 24 h to either  xxxg787xxx  (100 ng/ml) or vegf
(50 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of heparins (black
square = ufh, open triangle = enoxaparin, open circle =
 xxxd1805xxx ). both  xxxg787xxx  and vegf significantly increased hmec1 proliferation. the addition of lmwhs or ufh dose-dependently inhibited ec proliferation induced by either cytokine.
the results are reported as mean ± sd of 5 different experiments
performed in triplicate.

[29,30]. similarly, in the in vitro model of angiogenesis
in huvec, lmwh in the range of 3–6 kda significantly
inhibited  xxxg787xxx - and vegf-induced angiogenesis,
whereas no inhibition was observed with ufh, tetrasaccharide, pentasaccharide and octasaccharide [11].
in our study we demonstrate that this occurs in the
microvascular endothelial cell model, not only when
ec are stimulated by standard proangiogenic factors,
but also by tumor derived products. in these experimental conditions, a lower effect of ufh compared to
lmwh in inhibiting angiogenesis is apparent.
the differential effect of lmwhs compared to ufh
on angiogenesis has been observed also in studies of
other ec activities. in a previous study we demonstrated that lmwh and ufh have different effects on
the hemostatic properties of endothelial cells [31].
we could observe that lmwh (i.e.  xxxd1805xxx ) and ufh
suppress lps-mediated  xxxg748xxx  (tf) expression
and increase the anticoagulant properties of ec. in the
microvascular setting (i.e. hmec-1),  xxxd1805xxx  has a
significantly greater effect than ufh in decreasing tf
and increasing  xxxg2277xxx  and tf pathway
inhibitor ( xxxg2266xxx ) expression. we also observed that
both ufh and lmwh reduced tf mrna levels in hmec1 [31]. as tf is involved in tumor angiogenesis through
the regulation of vegf expression [32], it could be
hypothesized that heparins can interfere with the
angiogenic process through tf downregulation as
well.
in this work, we did not observe a significant effect
of tcm on ec proliferation, indeed only tcm from
breast cancer induced a very slight, statistically
insignificant, increase of cell proliferation. nor did
we observe a significant effect of heparins on ec
proliferation in the presence of tcm. differently, the
heparins significantly inhibited growth factor-induced
proliferation. in this regard, our results are in agreement with those published by collen et al. [33], who
found a significant inhibition of  xxxg787xxx - and vegfinduced microvascular endothelial cell proliferation
by ufh and by a commercial lmwh (i.e. reviparin),
and with the data of khorana et al. [11], who found a
significant inhibition of  xxxg787xxx -induced proliferation of
huvec by both ufh and fractions of lmwh of 3 and
6 kda.
nevertheless, we must keep in mind that angiogenesis is a multi-step process. indeed, endothelial cell
proliferation and cell reorganization constitute two
key moments for a successful formation of new vessels.
the matrigel model of angiogenesis explores the
capacity of cells to organize in tubular structure (i.e.
migration and differentiation), and this event does not
critically depend on endothelial proliferation. therefore, we can hypothesize that the inhibitory activity of
heparins against the proangiogenic stimulus of tcm is
not mainly related to an inhibition of microvascular ec

heparins and tumor angiogenesis
proliferation, but more likely to an intervention at the
level of cell differentiation and reorganization induced
by tumor cell derived products. differently, the inhibition of ec proliferation and differentiation in tubule
structures are both involved in the antiangiogenic
activity of heparin against pure standard growth
factor-induced angiogenesis.
in conclusion, we found that heparins can affect the
angiogenic stimulus of tumor-derived products, as well
as standard proangiogenic factors, and that lmwh are
more effective than ufh in this process. the antiangiogenic activity of lmwh, together with the known
anticoagulant and antiinflammatory activities of these
agents provides further basis for the beneficial clinical
effects observed in the cancer setting.
