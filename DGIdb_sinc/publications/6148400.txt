like diazepam, the binding affinities of  xxxd84xxx 
and its metabolites are significantly enhanced in the
presence of l o - 5 ~muscimol as demonstrated by the
decrease in ki value (table 1). the binding affinity of
ro 15-1788 was not altered by the presence of
muscimol. however, the presence of muscimol decreased the binding of p-cce and 0-ccm and increased
ki values by 21.4 and 5 5 %, respectively (table 2). the
presence of muscimol increases the binding affinities of
benzodiazepine agonists like alprazolam, diazepam and
cl 218872. in contrast to the agonists, the binding
affinities of benzodiazepine antagonists like p-cce and
p-ccm are significantly reduced by muscimol (braestrup & nielsen 1981; braestrup et all982; skolnick et a1
