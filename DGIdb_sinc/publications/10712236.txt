 xxxd2042xxx –c489, 2000.—the polyamines spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx ,
and their precursor putrescine are essential for cell growth
and the regulation of the cell cycle. recent studies suggest
that excessive accumulation of polyamines favors either
malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell
type and the stimulus. this study examines the involvement
of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the dna
topoisomerase i inhibitor,  xxxd412xxx . in iec-6 cells,  xxxd412xxx  induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. detached cells showed dna laddering and
 xxxg341xxx  induction, characteristic features of apoptosis.
depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx  by dl-␣ xxxd2430xxx  ( xxxd1972xxx ), a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) that is the first rate-limiting
enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic
index. delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in
 xxxg341xxx  activity in polyamine-depleted cells. addition of
putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by
an increase in the number of detached cells and  xxxg341xxx 
activity. polyamine depletion did not change the level of
 xxxg341xxx  protein. inhibition of  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); degbg] led to depletion of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  with a significant accumulation of putrescine and
induction of odc. the degbg-treated cells showed an
increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. addition of putrescine to
 xxxd1972xxx -treated cell extracts did not increase  xxxg341xxx  activity. the above results indicate that polyamine depletion
delays the onset of apoptosis in iec-6 cells and confers
protection against dna damaging agents, suggesting that
polyamines might be involved in the caspase activating signal
cascade.

cells require optimal levels of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx  for growth and differentiation and are therefore equipped with intricate mechanisms for the control of polyamine levels (10, 19, 29, 39,
40, 62). any cell that becomes polyamine-deficient is
severely limited in its ability to grow and proliferate.

our laboratory has studied the role of polyamines in
the growth and repair of the gastrointestinal mucosa
and has examined these processes in both rats and in
cultured intestinal iec-6 epithelial cells, a nontransformed line derived from fetal rat crypt cells (45). in
iec-6 cells, inhibition of  xxxg1626xxx  (odc),
which catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis by ␣- xxxd2430xxx 
( xxxd1972xxx ), depletes polyamines, inhibits growth, and
prevents normal repair of mucosal stress ulcers (31, 59,
60). recently, we demonstrated that depletion of polyamines leads to cell cycle arrest but does not induce
apoptosis in iec-6 cells (47). there is also evidence
suggesting that polyamines play a role in apoptotic cell
death (16, 38, 42, 44, 64). tobias and kahana (57) and
pouline et al. (44) reported that excessive accumulation
of polyamines in odc-overproducing cells induced
apoptosis (44, 57).
apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the result of
biochemical events carried out by a family of cysteine
proteases called caspases. caspases were implicated in
apoptosis with the discovery that ced-3, the product of
a gene required for cell death in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, is related to mammalian interleukin-1␤-converting enzyme (ice or  xxxg340xxx ) (56, 65,
66). caspases share similarities in amino acid sequence, structure, and substrate specificity (37). they
are all expressed as proenzymes (30–50 kda) that
contain three domains: an nh2-terminal domain, a
large subunit (⬃20 kda), and a small subunit (⬃10
kda). caspase activation requires proteolytic cleavage
between the domains and the formation of heterodimers. the mechanisms and series of events that
cause apoptosis are becoming clearer. degradation of
nuclear dna at internucleosomal sites occurs during
the final stages of apoptosis, but is not essential,
because apoptosis occurs in enucleated cells (58). on
the other hand, cell signaling involving src homology 2
(sh2) domains and proteolysis may respectively cue
the ‘‘initiation’’ and ‘‘execution’’ phases of apoptosis (12).
in xenopus extracts, sh2 fusion proteins and related
synthetic peptides inhibited the initiation of programmed cell death (pcd). in other work, recombinant
caspase expression increased pcd (33), whereas protease inhibition prevented it (26, 50). this deathpromoting action of caspases and other proteases is
associated with the cleavage of specific proteins. the
initiation and execution phases of pcd may be connected in that apoptotic proteases target specific pro-

polyamines and apoptosis

tein substrates essential to signal transduction. for
example, in one cell system, serine proteases attacked
pitslre (conserved pstaire box region of  xxxg407xxx  p34)
kinase, generating a truncated apoptosis-inducing isoform (27). similarly, cysteine proteases belonging to the
ced-3/ice family cleave the murine double minute
(mdm) oncoprotein, which normally downregulates
p53 (11). this increases p53 and leads to apoptosis in
this system.
apoptosis is vitally important for development and
maintenance of tissue homeostasis and is a tightly
regulated process (63). intestinal cells derived from
stem cells at the base of the intestinal crypts proliferate
and migrate along the crypt-villus axis until they reach
the lumen. at the luminal surface, they lose anchorage,
detach, and undergo apoptosis (14, 53). expression of
the  xxxg250xxx /bax family of proteins, cell to cell contact, cell
to extracellular matrix attachment, integrin expression, cytokines, environmental factors, and chemical
agents may contribute to the induction of apoptosis at
the luminal surface (2, 3, 20, 36, 52). detachmentinduced cell death is a recognized form of apoptosis in
freshly isolated human intestinal epithelial cells (17,
54) and other anchorage-dependent cell types, such as
bronchial epithelial cells, mammary epithelial cells,
renal epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (1, 4, 13, 33,
48). a nontumorigenic line of rat intestinal epithelial
cells (iec-18) normally died within 48–72 h when
cultured as multicellular spheroids on a nonadhesive
surface (46). yet, mutant  xxxg1077xxx  expression in these
cells inhibited pcd. finally, inducible oncogenic ras
has been shown in  xxxg1177xxx -dependent hematopoeitic cells to upregulate ‘‘survival’’ proteins, bcl-2 and
 xxxg251xxx , suppressing pcd (23). although it is not yet
determined that ras activation directly promotes the
survival of intestinal epithelial cells through either
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) or the raf pathway, in c-myc-induced fibroblast apoptosis, ras can
have either an anti-apoptotic or a proapoptotic action
depending on whether pi3k or  xxxg1924xxx  pathways
are respectively activated (22, 51).
based on our previous work showing that polyamine
depletion upregulated p53 without causing apoptosis,
and because apoptosis is an important process in the
maintenance of tissue homeostasis of gut epithelium,
we investigated the role of polyamines in camptothecininduced apoptosis in iec-6 cells.

materials. medium and other cell culture reagents were
obtained from gibco brl (grand island, ny). fetal bovine
serum (fbs), dialyzed fbs (dfbs; 10,000 mol wt cutoff), and
 xxxd412xxx  were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo).
enhanced chemiluminescence western blot detection system
was purchased from dupont-nen (boston, ma).  xxxd1972xxx  was
a gift from merrell dow (cincinnati, oh), and diethylglyoxal
bis-(guanylhydrazone) (degbg) was synthesized for our
laboratory by dr. patrick j. rodrigues and dr. mervyn israel
in the department of pharmacology at the university of
tennessee, memphis. anti- xxxg341xxx  (cpp 32) was purchased
from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca). tacs
apoptotic dna laddering kit was purchased from trevigen

c481

(gaithersburg, md). colorimetric caspase assay reagents
were purchased from biomol research laboratories (plymouth meeting, pa). the cell death detection elisa plus kit
was purchased from roche diagnostics (indianapolis, in).
the iec-6 cell line (atcc crl 1592) was obtained from
american type culture collection (rockville, md) at passage
13. the cell line was derived from normal rat intestine and
was developed and characterized by quaroni et al. (45). the
cells were nontumorigenic and retained the undifferentiated
character of epithelial stem cells. all other chemicals were of
the highest purity commercially available.
cell culture. iec-6 cell stock was maintained in t-150
flasks in a humidified 37°c incubator in an atmosphere of
90% air-10% co2. the medium consisted of dmem with 5%
heat-inactivated fbs, 10 µg insulin, and 50 µg gentamicin
sulfate/ml. the stock was passaged weekly at 1:10, fed three
times per week, and passages 15–20 were used. for the
experiments, the cells were taken up with 0.05% trypsin plus
0.53 mm edta in hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss)
without calcium and magnesium and counted by hemocytometer.
apoptosis studies. the cells were plated (day 0) at a density
of 6.25 ⫻ 104 cells/cm2 in t-150 flasks in dmem/dfbs with or
without the treatment compound(s) and with triplicate
samples for each group. cells were fed on day 2. on day 3,
medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium.
on day 4,  xxxd412xxx  (20 µm in dmso) or tumor necrosis
factor-␣ (tnf-␣; 20 ng/ml with or without 25 µg/ml cycloheximide) was added into the serum-free medium for 3–18 h with
the appropriate vehicle added to controls.
cell number. cell counts were determined separately for
floating and attached cells. floating cells were poured into a
25-ml tube and the monolayer was washed once with hbss
without calcium and magnesium. this wash was then combined into the tube with the floating cells. attached cells were
taken up with 0.05% trypsin plus 0.53 mm edta, followed by
one wash of the flask with dmem/5% fbs. cells were
counted on a model zf coulter counter. although flasks
contained approximately equal numbers of cells, floating cells
were expressed as a percentage of the total cell count obtained by combining the number of floating and attached
cells.
caspase activity. after treatment with  xxxd412xxx  (or
vehicle) on day 4, floating cells were poured off to be counted
and combined with one wash with cold dulbecco’s phosphate
buffer saline (dpbs). the attached cells were then harvested
for determination of caspase activity. briefly, 10 ml of dpbs
was added to the flask, and the monolayer was scraped and
collected into a 25-ml tube. the flask was washed once with
10 ml of dpbs and combined into the 25-ml tube. the cells
were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 g for 5 min. the
supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in
1 ml of cold dpbs and transferred into a microcentrifuge
tube. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g at
4°c for 10 min. the supernatant was discarded and the cells
were lysed in 100 µl of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm
hepes, ph 7.4, 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm edta,
and 0.1% nonidet p-40). the assay for caspase activity was
carried out in a 96-well plate. into each well was placed 20 µl
of cell lysate, 70 µl of assay buffer (50 mm hepes, ph 7.4,
0.1% chaps, 100 mm nacl, 10 mm dtt, and 1 mm edta),
and 10 µl of  xxxg341xxx  colorimetric substrate (2 mm devdpna prepared in assay buffer), a caspase specific peptide that
is conjugated to the chromogen p-nitroanilide (pna). the
96-well plate was incubated at 37°c for 2 h, during which
time the caspase in the sample was allowed to cleave the

chromophore p-na from the substrate molecule. absorbance
readings at 405 nm were made after the 2 h incubation, with
the caspase activity being directly proportional to the color
reaction. protein was determined for each sample using the
bicinchoninic acid method (pierce, rockford, il) and a standard curve for pna was constructed. caspase activity was
expressed as picomole of pna released per milligram of
protein per minute.
dna fragmentation. after treatment with  xxxd412xxx 
(or vehicle), floating cells were poured off and combined with
one dpbs wash of the monolayer. cells were pelleted by
centrifugation at 800 g for 5 min. the supernatant was
discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of
resuspension buffer. the attached cells were collected for
dna fragmentation by scraping in dpbs and combining with
one wash of the flask with dpbs. the cells were pelleted at
800 g for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet
was resuspended in 100 µl of resuspension buffer. the
nucleosomal fragmentation assay was carried out by isolating
dna from the cells using the tacs apoptotic dna laddering
kit and analyzing the labeled dna by agarose gel electrophoresis according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
quantitative dna fragmentation elisa. cells were grown
in six-well culture plates. after treatment with  xxxd412xxx 
(or vehicle), floating cells were discarded and the attached
cells were collected by trypsinization. cells were pelleted by
centrifugation at 800 g for 5 min, washed once with dpbs,
and resuspended in 3 ml dpbs. one milliliter of the cell
suspension was taken for protein determination and the
remainder were used for the dna fragmentation elisa.
cells were processed according to instructions provided in the
kit. briefly, cells were lysed and centrifuged to remove the
nuclei. an aliquot of the nuclei-free supernatant was placed
into the streptavidin-coated wells and incubated with antihistone-biotin and anti-dna peroxidase conjugate for 2 h at
room temperature. after incubation, the sample was removed
and the wells were washed three times with incubation
buffer. after the final wash was removed, 100 µl of the
substrate 2,28-azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazolin-sulfonat] was
placed in the wells for 20 min at room temperature. the
absorbance was read at 405 nm using a plate reader. results
were expressed as absorbance at 405 nm/mg protein.
western blot analysis. total cell protein (50 µg) from cell
extracts prepared for  xxxg341xxx  assay was separated on 15%
sds-page and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for
western blotting. equal loading of protein was confirmed by
staining the nitrocellulose membrane with ponceau s. the
membrane was then probed with an antibody directed against
 xxxg341xxx . the immunocomplexes were visualized by the
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system.
polyamine levels. intracellular polyamines were analyzed
by hplc as previously described (58). briefly, cells were
plated in 60-mm dishes at 6.25 ⫻ 104 cells/cm2 and grown in
dmem/dfbs with or without  xxxd1972xxx  or degbg. after
washing the monolayer three times with ice-cold dpbs, we
added 0.5 m perchloric acid and then froze the samples at
⫺80°c until ready for extraction, dansylation, and hplc.
the standard curve encompassed the range of 0.31–10 µm.
values that fell ⬎25% below the curve were considered not
detectable. protein was determined by the bradford method (5).
statistics. data are means ⫾ se from representative
experiments. all experiments were repeated three times (n ⫽
3). absence of error bars in figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7 indicates that
se was too small to be seen as separate from the mean. the
significance of the differences between means was determined by anova and appropriate post hoc testing. values of
p ⬍ 0.05 were regarded as significant.

induction of apoptosis by  xxxd412xxx . recently, we
reported that polyamine depletion increases levels of
p53 and arrests the cell cycle in g1 phase but does not
induce apoptosis in iec-6 cells (47). this observation
suggested the intriguing possibility that polyamines
were involved in the apoptotic process in general. to
examine the role of polyamines in the regulation of
apoptosis in iec-6 cells, we used a chemical agent,
 xxxd412xxx  ( xxxg2310xxx  inhibitor), which
is known to induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cells
(21, 28, 49). detachment-induced cell death has been
reported in isolated intact intestinal crypts (17); therefore, we presumed that cells undergoing apoptosis
would detach and that the extent of detachment could
be used as an apoptotic index.
to establish the method of evaluation of apoptosis in
iec-6 cells, we treated confluent iec-6 cells with
 xxxd412xxx  (20 µg/ml) and monitored the detachment of cells from the dish surface. we observed a
significant increase (8-fold) in the number of floating
cells in the  xxxd412xxx  treated group compared with
the dmso-treated (the vehicle for  xxxd412xxx ) control group within 6 h of treatment (fig. 1a). detached
and attached cells were harvested and examined for
evidence of apoptosis by  xxxg341xxx  activity using devdpna as substrate and by dna fragmentation. for this
experiment, cells were treated with 20 µm  xxxd412xxx  for a longer period of time (16 h) to harvest enough
floating cells for analysis. with  xxxd412xxx  treatment, attached cells showed a sevenfold increase in
 xxxg341xxx  activity (fig. 1b) but did not show remarkable dna fragmentation (fig. 1c). detached cells from
both the control and the  xxxd412xxx -treated groups
showed characteristic nucleosomal size dna fragments
and increased  xxxg341xxx  activity (fig. 1b and c).
because the dna fragmentation assay and  xxxg341xxx 
activity indicated that detached cells were apoptotic, in
subsequent experiments,  xxxg341xxx  activity was measured only in attached cells as a marker of the ‘‘initiation’’ phase of apoptosis. these results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the  xxxg2310xxx  inhibitor for
the induction of apoptosis in iec-6 cells.
effect of polyamine depletion on the induction of
apoptosis. to study the involvement of polyamines in
 xxxd412xxx -induced apoptosis, iec-6 cells were grown
for 4 days in the presence or absence of  xxxd1972xxx , the
highly specific inhibitor of odc. previous studies from
this laboratory have shown that  xxxd1972xxx  treatment
depletes putrescine within 3 h, but that depletion of
spermidine requires 24 h, and significant depletion
(about 50%) of  xxxd3234xxx  requires 3 days (32).
we examined apoptosis 6 h after  xxxd412xxx  treatment. cells treated with  xxxd1972xxx  (polyamine depleted)
were protected against both dmso (vehicle) and  xxxd412xxx -induced apoptosis. a decrease (of about 3-fold)
in the number of floating cells was observed in polyamine-depleted cells compared with control cells treated
with  xxxd412xxx  (fig. 2a). short-term  xxxd1972xxx  treatment along with  xxxd412xxx  (6 h) did not show any

to gain insight to the apoptotic induction profile, we
examined the time course of the induction of apoptosis
by  xxxd412xxx  in control and polyamine-depleted
conditions. results in fig. 3a indicate that  xxxd412xxx -induced apoptosis (as judged by the number of
floating cells) began within 3 h and increased progressively up to 18 h (from 6.2% at time 0 to 49.3% at 18 h)
in control cells. interestingly, the onset of apoptosis was
delayed in  xxxd1972xxx -treated cells for up to 12 h (from 2.2%
at time 0 to 9.3% at 12 h) and reached a maximum of
29.1% at 18 h. as mentioned previously, to understand
early events in caspase induction, attached cells from
the above experiment were collected for the determination of  xxxg341xxx  activity.  xxxg341xxx  activity increased
progressively with time in control cells. in contrast,
 xxxd1972xxx -treated cells did not show remarkable increases
in  xxxg341xxx  activity for up to 12 h. a significant
increase in  xxxg341xxx  activity was observed only after
18 h of exposure to  xxxd412xxx  (fig. 3b). the above
results clearly indicate that polyamine depletion delays
the onset of apoptosis in iec-6 cells, and suggest that
intracellular polyamine levels may be critical factors in
the regulation of spontaneous apoptosis in intestinal
cell homeostasis.
we next determined whether the decrease in apoptosis seen after polyamine depletion could be prevented
by exogenous polyamines. as shown in fig. 4,  xxxd1972xxx 
again decreased the number of floating cells compared
with control. addition of exogeneous 10 µm putrescine
along with  xxxd1972xxx  restored the number of floating cells
to control levels. dna fragmentation was evident in
floating cells irrespective of the treatment.
to determine the specificity of the effect of polyamine
depletion on apoptosis, we used tnf-␣, a receptormediated physiological inducer of apoptosis, along with
cycloheximide. neither tnf-␣ (20 ng/ml) nor cyclohexi-

mide (25 µg/ml) alone induced apoptosis in iec-6 cells
(data not shown). however, treatment of the cells with
tnf-␣ plus cycloheximide resulted in a significant
induction of apoptosis in control cells (fig. 5a). as was
the case with  xxxd412xxx , polyamine depletion protected against apoptosis induced by tnf-␣ plus cycloheximide. addition of exogenous putrescine to dfmotreated cells resulted in control levels of apoptosis.

were determined for control,  xxxd1972xxx , and  xxxd1972xxx  plus putrescine

 xxxg341xxx  activity in the attached cells from this
experiment showed a pattern that was identical to that
seen with  xxxd412xxx . figure 5b shows that tnf-␣
and cycloheximide significantly increased  xxxg341xxx 
activity. this increase was largely prevented by  xxxd1972xxx 
and restored by the addition of exogenous putrescine in
the presence of  xxxd1972xxx .
intracellular polyamine levels can be altered by
inhibiting either odc or  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase (sam-dc) activities by  xxxd1972xxx  or degbg,
respectively. degbg blocks the conversion of putrescine to spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  resulting in high
intracellular putrescine and low spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  levels. iec-6 cells were grown in the presence and
absence of degbg, and intracellular polyamine levels
were determined. results in fig. 6a show that degbg
significantly increased the putrescine level and significantly decreased the levels of spermidine (fig. 6b) and
 xxxd3234xxx  (fig. 6c) over 4 days of treatment. these
results indicate that inhibition of sam-dc leads to an
accumulation of putrescine with concomitant depletion
of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx . because intracellular
putrescine is rapidly converted to spermidine and
 xxxd3234xxx , results in fig. 4 do not indicate which of the
polyamines may be involved in the apoptotic process.
therefore, putrescine accumulation and odc induction by degbg proved to be an important tool for

polyamines and apoptosis

 xxxd2049xxx 

whereas depletion of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  leads to
the inhibition of apoptosis in iec-6 cells.
to confirm the above results, we examined the effects
of the polyamine modulators ( xxxd1972xxx  and degbg) on
another index of apoptosis, quantitative dna fragmentation by an elisa method. treatment with 20 µm
 xxxd412xxx  for 6 h resulted in a significant increase
in dna fragmentation in control cells (fig. 8). the
extent of dna fragmentation was inhibited by polyamine depletion and was significantly restored by
exogenous putrescine. inhibition of sam-dc activity
by degbg did not significantly affect the degree of
dna fragmentation. these results for dna fragmentation are in agreement with both the  xxxg341xxx  activity
and floating cell number indices of apoptosis.
the above results suggest that polyamine depletion
either decreases the level of  xxxg341xxx  protein or that
putrescine may be required for the activation of caspase
3 or for the signal transduction cascade involved in the
induction of apoptosis. figure 9 shows the levels of
procaspase 3 (32 kda protein) in the attached cells

were calculated based on total cell number for each
treatment group. figure 7a shows that  xxxd1972xxx  led to a
progressive decrease in the percentage of floating cells

to  xxxd412xxx . compared with control (18.8%),  xxxd1972xxx 
treatment for only 1 day, which results in putrescine
depletion, but not spermidine or  xxxd3234xxx  depletion,
did not affect the percentage of floating cells. in contrast to this, degbg treatment significantly increased
the percentage of floating cells on days 1, 2, and 4 (26.6,
26.9, and 23.3%) compared with  xxxd1972xxx -treated as well
as with control cells.  xxxg341xxx  activity followed the
same pattern as that for the number of floating cells
(fig. 7b). these results show that accumulation of
putrescine is associated with the induction of apoptosis,

which were low in  xxxg341xxx  activity and added putrescine into the reaction mixture during the  xxxg341xxx

discussion

apoptosis is required for all multicellular organisms
to achieve and maintain homeostasis of cell numbers
within their tissues. increased apoptosis produces degenerative diseases of the central nervous system or
immunodeficiencies, whereas failure to undergo apoptosis results in developmental abnormalities and cancer
(20, 63). the gastrointestinal tract is no exception, and
the normal regulation of apoptosis is crucial to preventing hyperplasia and malignancies. in the small intestine, spontaneous apoptosis during development is
necessary to achieve the optimal number of stem cells.
thus understanding the mechanisms that influence
and control apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium has
considerable clinical as well as physiological relevance.
previous studies from our laboratory have established
the involvement of polyamines in the regulation of
intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and migration
(31, 32, 60). we have shown that polyamine depletion of

fig. 9. polyamine depletion does not alter procaspase 3 protein level.
cells were grown for 3 days in dmem/5% dfbs with or without 5
mm  xxxd1972xxx  and 10 µm putrescine. cells were serum deprived for 24 h
before harvesting cells for preparation of cell lysate for western
immunoblotting.

iec-6 cells increases levels of p53 and p21 and leads to
cell cycle arrest (47). chen et al. (7) have shown that
p53 and the extent of dna damage, among other
variables, can lead either to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. in fact, p53 may induce apoptosis in some cells and
cell cycle arrest in others in response to the same
stimulus. we found no evidence of increased apoptosis
in iec-6 cells undergoing cell cycle arrest in response
to  xxxd1972xxx .
these findings have led us in the present study to
examine the influence of polyamine levels on the induction of apoptosis in iec-6 cells by an agent that causes
dna damage.  xxxd412xxx , an inhibitor of dna
topoisomerase i, has been used widely to induce apoptosis under experimental conditions and is in phase iii
clinical trials for the treatment of colon cancer (8, 9).
 xxxd412xxx  proved to be an effective apoptotic agent
in our iec-6 cell model.  xxxd412xxx  led to detachment of cells from the substratum as evidenced by
floating cells in the medium. floating cells exhibited
nucleosomal dna fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis (fig. 1a and b). the induction of caspase activity,
considered to be an early event in the apoptotic pathway, was measured in attached cells as well as in
floating cells. floating cells, irrespective of the presence or absence of  xxxd412xxx , showed caspase activity as well as dna fragmentation (fig. 1). in contrast,
attached cells treated with  xxxd412xxx  had very high
levels of  xxxg341xxx  activity compared with control cells.
the above results indicate that detachment of cells can
be used as an index for detection of apoptosis, and that
 xxxd412xxx  induces  xxxg341xxx  activity in iec-6 cells.
although cellular substrates for the caspase family of
proteases involved in apoptosis are not well understood,  xxxg341xxx  has been shown to cleave focal adhesion kinase,  xxxg979xxx , and actin (15, 24, 30). this
suggests that detachment of cells during induction of
apoptosis by  xxxd412xxx  may be due to the cleavage
of cytoskeletal proteins by caspases causing disruption
of the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complexes.
polyamines are critical for optimal cell growth, and
the polyamine pool shows only modest changes during
the cell cycle (6, 10, 40). results depicted in figs. 2 and
3 clearly indicate that a certain level of intracellular
polyamines is necessary for apoptosis. four days’ treatment with  xxxd1972xxx  and subsequent polyamine depletion
delayed the apoptotic response to  xxxd412xxx  by at
least 12 h. cells grown for 4 days in the presence of
 xxxd1972xxx , and exogenous putrescine had apoptotic responses indistinguishable from control cells (figs. 4
and 5). thus there is no doubt that the effects of dmfo
are produced by polyamine depletion, and that they are
due specifically to the absence of physiologically active
polyamines.
the questions of which polyamines and what intracellular levels must be present for normal effects are
interesting ones.  xxxd1972xxx  and the subsequent inhibition
of odc cause time-dependent decreases in intracellular putrescine, followed by spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx .
in iec-6 cells, putrescine disappears by 3 h, spermidine by 24 h, and  xxxd3234xxx  remains at levels equal to

polyamines and apoptosis

around 40% of control even after 3 days’ incubation
with  xxxd1972xxx  (32). as shown in fig. 7, there was a
significant decrease in apoptosis after 2 days’ treatment with  xxxd1972xxx . at this time, half the intracellular
 xxxd3234xxx  is still present, but because of their strong
positive charge, most polyamines probably exist bound
to macromolecules like proteins and dna. it may well
be that the only active polyamines, in terms of regulating physiological processes, are those that are free.
thus the free polyamine pool may decrease within a
few hours after the inhibition of putrescine production.
when exogenous putrescine is supplied to cells incubated with  xxxd1972xxx , it restores cell growth, migration,
and apoptosis to normal. but these effects are not
caused necessarily by putrescine, for it is rapidly
converted to spermidine and then to  xxxd3234xxx . putrescine depletion by itself ( xxxd1972xxx  treatment for 1 day) did
not affect the apoptotic index or caspase induction (fig.
7). however, with spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  depletion
( xxxd1972xxx  treatment for 2 to 4 days), apoptosis was
significantly decreased. on the other hand, putrescine
accumulation after degbg treatment led to a remarkable increase in cell detachment and caspase activity
compared with  xxxd1972xxx  and control cells. differences in
caspase activities in various treatments were not due to
changes in the level of caspase protein, which is evident
from the western blot analysis in fig. 9. the lower
caspase activity of  xxxd1972xxx -treated cells was not increased when supplemented with exogenous putrescine
in the assay system (data not shown). these results
indicate that polyamine depletion does not affect the
level of caspase protein and does not directly modulate
caspase activity, but that the intracellular polyamine
pool is very important in the regulation of apoptosis.
as we have already pointed out in the introduction,
high levels of polyamines induce apoptosis in a variety
of cell types (34, 38, 43, 44, 57). our data in fig. 7
confirm these findings in that abnormally high putrescine levels caused apoptosis in iec-6 cells. in addition,
however, our results demonstrated for the first time
that normal levels of polyamines are necessary for
programmed cell death to occur within the usual time
frame following an apoptotic stimulus. it is likely that
polyamines are necessary for normal progression to
apoptosis regardless of the stimulus.  xxxd412xxx 
causes apoptosis by preventing the repair of damaged
dna, but we obtained identical results with a combination of tnf-␣ and cycloheximide (fig. 5). tnf-␣ elicits
an apoptotic response by binding to a physiological
receptor.
aberrant induction of odc activity leads to malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell
type and stimulus (44). association of polyamines with
dna and rna suggests that they play an important
role in nucleic acid structure and function. spermidine
and  xxxd3234xxx  are able to condense dna into a highly
fluid structure, which is essential for biological function
(41). the highest concentrations of polyamines are
generally found in the g1 phase of the cell cycle (55) as
a prerequisite in the cell’s preparation for dna synthesis. it has been suggested that the catenation of dna by

c487

topoisomerases requires the aggregation of dna molecules by spermidine (25). thus it is clear that polyamines play crucial roles in cellular organization. transglutaminase induction by  xxxd412xxx  has been
reported as a possible cause of apoptosis in keratinocytes (28). cell cycle regulators, like  xxxg410xxx , also play
crucial roles in the induction of apoptosis (18, 63).
polyamine depletion reduces  xxxg2274xxx 
activity (61) and results in cell cycle arrest by induction
of cdk inhibitory proteins in iec-6 (47). therefore, it is
reasonable to believe that polyamine depletion associated changes in the physiological state of the cell may
be responsible for a delay in apoptosis.
it appears from both the current results and our
previous work (47) that polyamine depletion results in
cell cycle arrest and the prevention of apoptosis by
triggering active signal transduction pathways. this is
an important concept that represents a change in the
approach to understanding some functions of polyamines. thus it is not only that some functions of the
cell fail to occur in the absence of polyamines, but also
that the absence of polyamines initiates events that
result in changes in cell function. for instance, it is
likely that the activation of p53, p21, and p27 in the
absence of polyamines leads to the inhibition of  xxxg410xxx 
and produces cell cycle arrest (47). the cascade of
events leading to the inhibition of apoptosis in polyamine-depleted cells remains to be elucidated.
