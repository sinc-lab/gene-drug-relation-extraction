dimethylfumarate attenuates renal fibrosis via  xxxg1556xxx -related factor 2-mediated inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta/smad signaling.  tgf-beta plays a key role in the development of renal fibrosis. suppressing the tgf-beta signaling pathway is a possible therapeutic approach for preventing this disease, and reports have suggested that nrf2 protects against renal fibrosis by inhibiting tgf-beta signaling. this study examines whether dimethylfumarate (dmf), which stimulates nrf2, prevents renal fibrosis via the nrf2-mediated suppression of tgf-beta signaling. results showed that dmf increased nuclear levels of nrf2, and both dmf and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of nrf2 (ad-nrf2) decreased pai-1, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma), fibronectin and type 1 collagen expression in tgf-beta-treated rat mesangial cells (rmcs) and renal fibroblast cells (nrk-49f). additionally, dmf and ad-nrf2 repressed tgf-beta-stimulated  xxxg2170xxx  activity by inhibiting  xxxg2170xxx  phosphorylation, which was restored by sirna-mediated knockdown of nrf2 expression. however, downregulation of the antioxidant response element (are)-driven nrf2 target genes such as  xxxg1592xxx ,  xxxg1062xxx  and  xxxg1073xxx  (gst) did not reverse the inhibitory effect of dmf on tgf-beta-induced upregulation of profibrotic genes or extracellular matrix proteins, suggesting an are-independent anti-fibrotic activity of dmf. finally, dmf suppressed unilateral ureteral obstruction (uuo)-induced renal fibrosis and alpha-sma, fibronectin and type 1 collagen expression in the obstructed kidneys from uuo mice, along with increased and decreased expression of nrf2 and phospho- xxxg2170xxx , respectively. in summary, dmf attenuated renal fibrosis via the nrf2-mediated inhibition of tgf-beta/ xxxg2170xxx  signaling in an are-independent manner, suggesting that dmf could be used to treat renal fibrosis.
