abstract
despite the optimization of chemotherapy regimens,
treatment outcomes for advanced non-small cell lung
cancer (nsclc) are still considered to be disappointing. thus, clinical research of new treatment strategies
is warranted. several targeted agents have been introduced into clinical trials in nsclc, but to date, only a
few of these new agents can offer hope of a substantial
impact on the natural history of the disease. one of the
main reasons for the failure of several clinical trials of
targeted therapy in lung cancer is that there is multilevel cross-stimulation among the targets of the new biological agents along several pathways of signal
transduction that lead to neoplastic events; blocking
only one of these pathways, as most first-generation targeted agents do, allows others to act as salvage or escape
mechanisms for cancer cells. sorafenib and sunitinib
are two oral multitargeted receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors. sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that inhib-

its the kinase activity of both c-raf and b-raf and
targets the  xxxg2413xxx  receptor
family ( xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg802xxx ) and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor family (pdgfr-␤ and stem cell
factor receptor [kit]). sunitinib is a multitargeted inhibitor of pdgfr, kit, fms-like  xxxg2198xxx  3, and
vegfr. the kinases targeted and inhibited by sorafenib and sunitinib directly and indirectly regulate tumor growth, survival, and angiogenesis, and this might
be expected to result in broad antitumor efficacy. sorafenib and sunitinib have been approved by the u.s.
food and drug administration for the treatment of
metastatic renal cell carcinoma; sunitinib has also
been approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal
stromal tumors. their mechanism of action, preclinical data, and phase ii studies suggest efficacy in the
treatment of advanced nsclc. the oncologist 2007;12:

introduction

process in general further supports the need to interfere at
different stages to avoid an escape mechanism for the cell.
whether the multitarget approach can be accomplished
by using combinations of selective agents or specific agents
that intrinsically target various targets is a matter of debate
[12]. combination trials are relatively easy only when the
compounds are all owned or licensed by one company.
such a multitargeted strategy has recently been validated in a number of preclinical and clinical studies using
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (rtk) inhibitors with broad target
selectivity [13]. sorafenib (nexavar®; bayer pharmaceuticals corporation, west haven, ct) and sunitinib (sutent®;
pfizer inc., new york) are two multitargeted receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors and among the most promising biologic agents in the treatment of metastatic solid tumors.

sorafenib and sunitinib: mechanisms
of action
many of the processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways
initiated by activated rtks [14]. rtks, such as vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr), stem cell factor receptor (kit), and fms-like  xxxg2198xxx  3 ( xxxg801xxx ), are
expressed in malignant tissues and act in concert, playing
diverse and major roles in angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
metastasis [15]. ras functions downstream of several
rtks, and activation of ras signaling pathways is an important mechanism by which human cancers develop [16].
constitutive activation of the ras pathways occurs
through mutational activation of the ras oncogene or
downstream effectors of ras [17]. ras activation can also
be facilitated by overexpression of a variety of rtks, including those for the egfr, pdgfr, or vegfr growth
factors [18 –20]. in this way, most human tumors, not just
those with ras mutations, depend upon activation of the
ras signal transduction pathways to achieve cellular proliferation and survival [18]. ras regulates several pathways that synergistically induce cellular transformation,
including the well-characterized raf/mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase (mek)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (erk) cascade. raf kinases are serine/threonine
protein kinases that function in this pathway as downstream
effector molecules of ras. ras localizes raf to the
plasma membrane, where raf initiates a mitogenic kinase
cascade that ultimately modulates gene expression via the
phosphorylation of transcription factors [17], which can
have profound effects on cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. the  xxxg1924xxx  family is composed of three mem-

lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality
in both men and women [1], with 1.2 million new cases diagnosed worldwide every year and 1 million deaths being
recorded worldwide in 2001 [2]. non-small cell lung cancer
(nsclc) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers. most nsclc patients present with advanced disease
at diagnosis, and a large percentage of those diagnosed with
early-stage disease eventually experience recurrence of
metastatic disease. for advanced disease, palliation and the
patient’s quality of life are still the primary goals of therapy,
with total cure remaining elusive.
although chemotherapy has recently produced promising results as neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies for earlystage patients [3, 4] and some progress has been made in the
treatment of locally advanced and advanced disease [5, 6],
treatment outcomes for nsclc are still very disappointing.
thus, clinical research of new treatment strategies is warranted. several targeted agents have been introduced into
clinical trials in nsclc, with many phase i and ii studies
already completed and some phase iii study results recently
becoming available [7–9]. to date, only a few of these new
agents offered hope of altering the natural history of the disease, and negative results are far more commonly reported
than positive ones. nevertheless, clinically meaningful advances have already been achieved. in chemotherapy-refractory advanced nsclc patients,  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva®;
osi pharmaceuticals, inc., melville, ny), an epidermal
growth factor receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (egfrtki), represents a further possibility of tumor control and
symptom palliation for a subset of patients otherwise eligible for supportive care only [7]. in chemotherapy-naı̈ve advanced nsclc patients (with nonsquamous histology), the
combination of the antivascular endothelial growth factor
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (avastin®; genentech
inc., south san francisco, ca) with chemotherapy has
yielded better survival outcomes than chemotherapy alone
[8].
one of the main reasons for the failure of several clinical
trials evaluating targeted therapy in lung cancer is the existence of multilevel cross-stimulation among the targets of
the new biological agents along several pathways of signal
transduction that lead to neoplastic events; blocking only
one of these pathways allows others to act as salvage or escape mechanisms for cancer cells. preclinical evidence of
synergistic antitumor activity achievable by combining targeted agents that block multiple signaling pathways has recently emerged [10, 11]. the complexity of the signaling

bers:  xxxg184xxx , b-raf, and  xxxg1924xxx  (also termed c-raf).
b-raf is reportedly mutated in 70% of malignant melanomas [21], in 33% of papillary thyroid carcinomas [22], and
in lower frequencies in other cancers [23]. recent evidence
suggests that  xxxg1924xxx  and b-raf participate in the regulation of endothelial apoptosis and, therefore, angiogenesis, a
process essential for tumor development and metastasis
[24, 25]. activating mutations in ras and b-raf have
been identified in several human cancers. in addition, several rtks acting upstream of ras are either mutated or
overexpressed in human tumors. because oncogenic activation of the ras/raf pathway may lead to a sustained
proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer drug discovery.
angiogenesis is a tightly regulated multistep process
that involves the interaction of multiple growth factors expressed as multiple isoforms, including vegfs,  xxxg787xxx , and pdgfs. vegf also regulates
vascular permeability [26]. vessel stabilization through
pericyte recruitment and maturation is primarily driven by
pdgf [27]. several antiangiogenic agents are currently being investigated in clinical trials; however, because of the
complex interactions between tumor cells, the invading
stroma, and new blood vessels, a therapeutic agent targeting
a single molecular entity might have limited efficacy across
a spectrum of tumor types [28]. in addition to their direct
role in tumor cell growth and survival, several split-kinase
domain rtks, namely the vegf receptors and pdgfr-␤,

www.theoncologist.com

play prominent roles in tumor neoangiogenesis [17]. vegf
produced by tumor cells and associated stromal cells acts on
endothelial cells, directly promoting their proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival, all critical facets of angiogenesis [19]. pdgfr-␤ is expressed on pericytes, smooth
muscle cells that provide mechanical support to vasculature, and tumor neovasculature [20]. pdgfr-␤ is also expressed on fibroblasts in the tumor stromal compartment;
these fibroblasts are important sources of vegf and other
growth factors [22]. recent data suggest that combined
pharmacological disruption of  xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and pdgfr-␤
signaling results in profound antiangiogenic effects [23].
thus, the signaling cascades generated by the splitkinase domain rtks described above (the vegf receptors
 xxxg1274xxx / xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg800xxx , the pdgf receptors pdgfr-␣ and
pdgfr-␤, kit, and  xxxg801xxx ) directly and indirectly regulate tumor growth, survival, and angiogenesis. inhibiting
these targets in concert might be expected to result in broad
antitumor efficacy.
sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx ) is an oral multikinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activity of both c-raf and braf and targets the  xxxg2413xxx 
receptor family ( xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg802xxx ) and plateletderived growth factor receptor family (pdgfr-␤ and kit)
[29]. sorafenib inhibits mek and erk phosphorylation in
various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of
human tumor xenograft models [29]. together, these data
suggest that sorafenib may inhibit tumor growth by a dual

sorafenib and sunitinib in the treatment of
renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal
stromal tumor, and
hepatocellular carcinoma
sorafenib
phase i studies of sorafenib, involving 163 patients treated
with different continuous oral-dosage schedules, identified
400 mg twice daily as the recommended phase ii dose [32,
33]. preliminary data from these studies suggested that sorafenib was associated with clinically durable stabilization
of previously progressive disease in patients affected by refractory solid tumors (mostly renal carcinoma). a large
phase ii randomized discontinuation trial was conducted
with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) in patients with
various types of tumors. results have been reported for 202
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma [34]. after a
12-week induction phase, 65 patients had stable disease and
were randomized to remain on sorafenib (n ⫽ 32) or to take
placebo (n ⫽ 33). the median progression-free survival
(pfs) time after randomization was longer with sorafenib
than with placebo (24 vs. 6 weeks; hazard ratio [hr] ⫽
0.29; p ⫽ .0087). the toxicity profile was acceptable, with
rash, hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, and hypertension responsive to standard medications. a subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled, phase iii trial called target
(treatment approaches in renal cancer global evaluation
trial) confirmed the efficacy of sorafenib in cytokinerefractory advanced renal carcinoma patients [35]. patients
enrolled in this trial had received a prior systemic therapy (a
cytokine-based regimen) in the prior 8 months. the median
pfs times were 24 weeks for sorafenib versus 12 weeks for
placebo (hr ⫽ 0.44; p ⬍ .00001). the 12-week progression-free rate was 79% for sorafenib versus 50% for pla-

cebo. sorafenib showed a favorable safety profile, with
manageable side effects. the main adverse events were
rash (31% any grade, 1% grade 3/4), hand-foot skin reactions (26% any grade, 5% grade 3/4), alopecia (23% any
grade, 0% grade 3/4), diarrhea (30% any grade, 1% grade
3/4), nausea (14% any grade, 1% grade 3/4), fatigue (18%
any grade, 2% grade 3/4), and hypertension (8% any grade,
1% grade 3/4). a prospectively planned interim overall survival analysis reflecting the crossover impact of placebo patients was then presented [36]. a total of 903 patients were
randomized (451 to sorafenib, 452 to placebo), and more
than 200 placebo patients crossed over to sorafenib. the
median overall survival was 19.3 months for sorafenib versus 15.9 months for placebo (hr ⫽ 0.77; 95% confidence
interval [ci], 0.63– 0.95; p ⫽ .015). with censoring of
crossover data, the median overall survival was 19.3
months for sorafenib versus 14.3 months for placebo
(hr ⫽ 0.74; 95% ci, 0.58 – 0.93; p ⫽ .010). the lower hr
observed after censoring placebo patients crossed over to
sorafenib suggests a continued beneficial effect of
sorafenib.
based on these results, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) announced the approval of sorafenib for patients with advanced renal cancer in december 2005.
moreover, the european commission recently granted orphan medicinal product status to sorafenib for the treatment
of hepatocellular carcinoma [37]. this approval is based on
a recommendation from the european medicines agency
and data from a phase ii, single-agent study. in that trial,
137 patients received continuous, oral sorafenib (400 mg)
twice daily in 4-week cycles. on the basis of independent
assessments, 3 (2.2%) patients achieved a partial response,
8 (5.8%) had a minor response, and 46 (33.6%) had stable
disease for at least 16 weeks. investigator-assessed median
time-to-progression (ttp) was 4.2 months, and median
overall survival was 9.2 months. grade 3 and 4 drug-related
toxicities included fatigue (9.5%), diarrhea (8.0%), and
hand-foot skin reaction (5.1%); 43% of patients treated
with sorafenib experienced stable disease for at least 4
months, and an additional 9% of patients experienced tumor shrinkage [38]. recently, a phase iii clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of sorafenib versus placebo in
hepatocellular carcinoma has concluded enrollment; data
are pending. moreover, sorafenib recently showed in phase
ii trials promising preliminary antitumor activity against
melanoma in combination with chemotherapy ( xxxd1796xxx 
and temozolomide) [39, 40]. phase iii trials of sorafenib
plus chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma
are ongoing.

mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of raf and kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of vegfr and pdgfr
signaling).
sunitinib ( xxxd3264xxx ) is a novel small molecule, an
orally selective multitargeted rtk inhibitor that exhibits
direct antitumor activity against tumor cells dependent
upon signaling through pdgfr, kit,  xxxg801xxx , or vegfr
for proliferation and survival in addition to antiangiogenic
activity through its potent inhibition of vegfr and
pdgfr signaling [30] (fig. 1). in mouse xenograft models,
 xxxd3264xxx  exhibits broad and potent antitumor activity,
causing regression, growth arrest, or substantially reduced
growth of various established xenografts derived from human or rat tumor cell lines [31]. table 1 summarizes the
mechanisms of action of both drugs.

in phase i clinical studies, the recommended dose of
sunitinib was found to be 50 mg orally once daily for 4
weeks, followed by 2 weeks off, in a repeated 6-week cycle
[41, 42]. pharmacokinetic data indicated good oral absorption and a long half-life (⬃40 hours) for this agent. promising activity in patients with renal cancers was observed.
using this schedule, a multicenter, phase ii clinical trial was
conducted to assess the clinical activity and safety of
sunitinib as second-line therapy for patients with metastatic
renal cancer who progressed after one prior cytokine therapy [43]. twenty-five (40%) of 63 patients treated with
sunitinib achieved a partial response, and 17 additional patients (27%) demonstrated stable disease. the median ttp
was 8.7 months (95% ci, 5.5–10.7), whereas the median
survival time was 16.4 months (95% ci, 10.8 –not yet attained). the most common adverse event was fatigue,
which was categorized as grade 3 in seven patients (11%).
these results were particularly noteworthy when compared
with those of prior studies of second-line therapy in metastatic renal cancer and sustained the rationale of a phase iii
trial of sunitinib versus interferon-␣ (ifn-␣) as first-line
treatment of metastatic renal cancer [44]. in this trial, untreated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma were
randomized 1:1 to receive sunitinib (6-week cycles: 50 mg
orally once daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off) or
ifn-␣ (6-week cycles: 9-million unit subcutaneous injection given three times weekly). the primary endpoint was
pfs. secondary endpoints included objective response rate,
overall survival, and adverse events. seven hundred fifty
patients were randomized: 375 to sunitinib, 375 to ifn-␣.
median pfs assessed by third-party independent review
was 47.3 weeks (95% ci, 40.9 –not yet attained) for
sunitinib versus 24.9 weeks (95% ci, 21.9 –37.1) for ifn-␣
(hr ⫽ 0.394; 95% ci, 0.297– 0.521; p ⬍ .000001). the objective response rate by third-party independent review was
24.8% (95% ci, 19.7–30.5) for sunitinib versus 4.9% (95%
ci, 2.7– 8.1) for ifn-␣ (p ⬍ .000001). the objective response rate by investigator assessment was 35.7% (95% ci,
30.9 – 40.8) for sunitinib versus 8.8% (95% ci, 6.1–12.1)

for ifn-␣ (p ⬍ .000001). eight percent withdrew from the
study because of adverse events on the sunitinib arm versus
13% on the ifn-␣ arm. these results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in pfs and objective response rate for sunitinib over ifn-␣ in first-line treatment
of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
in addition to targeting vegfrs, sunitinib targets c-kit,
which is often expressed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(gists); thus, it is a good candidate for the treatment of this
disease. in a phase i/ii study conducted in 97 patients with
progressive, metastatic gists refractory to  xxxd2333xxx , sunitinib induced clinical benefit in 65% of patients,
with an 8% partial response rate and 58% stable disease rate
[45]. a phase iii, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial definitively demonstrated the efficacy of sunitinib in the treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with gist [46, 47]. sunitinib was administered at 50
mg per day in 6-week cycles (4 weeks on treatment, 2
weeks off). in this trial, treatment was unblinded after progression, and patients who had received placebo were
crossed over to sunitinib therapy. sunitinib treatment resulted in a more than fourfold-longer median ttp (6.3 vs.
1.5 months with placebo; hr ⫽ 0.335; p ⬍ .00001) and a
statistically significant longer overall survival time (hr ⫽
0.491; p ⫽ .00674). the survival benefit for sunitinib may
have been underestimated as a result of the crossover of patients from placebo to active treatment. sunitinib was generally well tolerated with manageable toxicities: fatigue,
diarrhea, sore mouth, skin discoloration, and hypertension.
sunitinib therapy induced partial responses in 14 patients
(6.8%) and durable stable disease (ⱖ22 weeks) in 36 patients (17.4%) versus 0% partial response and stable disease
ⱖ22 weeks in 2 patients (1.9%) on placebo. four of nine
imatinib-intolerant patients achieved partial response with
sunitinib therapy versus zero of four imatinib-intolerant patients treated with placebo. in conclusion, sunitinib significantly prolonged ttp and overall survival in gist
patients for whom imatinib therapy had failed because of
resistance or intolerance. this trial is relevant for targeted
therapies in oncology because it demonstrated a major clin-

196

ical benefit from a multitargeted  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor in
patients resistant to a different kinase inhibitor. in consideration of these positive results, in january 2006, the fda
announced the approval of sunitinib malate for patients
with advanced renal cell carcinoma and with gist after
disease progression or intolerance to  xxxd2333xxx .

dce-mri results, one patient on cycle 1, day 15 showed
decrease in permeability parameters and tumor size;
dce-mri from the other two patients (one progressive
disease, one stable disease for 16 weeks) showed no decrease in the permeability parameters. these data suggested sorafenib was well tolerated and active against
relapsed nsclc. preliminary evidence of objective response was deemed to warrant second-stage accrual.
gatzemeier et al. [51] performed a multicenter, uncontrolled, phase ii trial that evaluated efficacy and
safety of sorafenib (400 mg twice daily, continuous) in
patients with relapsed or refractory advanced nsclc.
plasma for proteomic biomarker analysis (enzymelinked immunosorbent assay [elisa] [n ⫽ 44]; mass
spectrometry [n ⫽ 43]) was obtained at screening, day 21
of cycle 1, and day 1 of cycle 3; 52 of 54 patients enrolled
received sorafenib. most (49/52) patients who received
sorafenib had stage iv nsclc; 30 patients (59%) of 51
evaluable for efficacy had stable disease. although there
were no confirmed partial responses, tumor shrinkage
was observed in 15 (29%) patients (4 had ⱖ30% shrinkage). patients with stable disease had a median pfs of
23.7 weeks, whereas all evaluable patients (n ⫽ 51) had
a median pfs of 11.9 weeks and median overall survival
of 29.3 weeks. the most frequent drug-related adverse
events observed in 52 patients included diarrhea (21 patients [40%]), hand-foot skin reaction (19 patients
[37%]), and fatigue (14 patients [27%]). grade 3 hypertension occurred in two patients (4%) (table 2). three
patients discontinued treatment because of adverse
events (hand-foot skin reaction, elevated lipase, and
myocardial infarction). there were nine deaths within 30
days of discontinuation of sorafenib (five for progressive
disease, two for cardiopulmonary arrest, one for hemoptysis, and one for unknown causes). the levels of five
proteins measured by elisa, either at screening or
change over treatment duration, correlated significantly
with ttp or maximum tumor shrinkage. levels of five
additional proteins, identified by mass spectrometry,
also correlated with ttp. the authors concluded that
identified biomarkers may help assess efficacy of sorafenib in nsclc patients and that 400 mg of sorafenib
twice daily is generally well tolerated and shows efficacy
in patients with advanced, progressive nsclc, with approximately 60% of patients achieving disease stabilization.
in a multicenter, international, single-arm phase ii
study, gondek et al. [52] evaluated the impact of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced nsclc on patients’
health-related quality of life (hrql) and symptoms.

sorafenib may prove particularly active against nsclc
because the proliferation signaling of the ras/raf/mek/
erk pathway is increased in nsclc due to an increase
in  xxxg1285xxx  mutations [48]. sorafenib showed preclinical
activity against nsclc cell lines. combined with agents
used to treat nsclc (vinorelbine, cisplatin, and gefitinib), it has demonstrated a delay in tumor growth in
preclinical models of nsclc [49]. in fact, carter et al.
[49] demonstrated that concurrent administration of sorafenib with vinorelbine, cisplatin, or gefitinib is at least
as efficacious (in terms of tumor growth delay) as the individual agents alone, with no increase in toxicity. these
data support the inclusion of sorafenib in clinical trials in
nsclc employing combinations of both cytotoxic and
cytostatic agents.
liu et al. [50] initiated a single-agent sorafenib trial
in patients with relapsed nsclc to assess clinical response and translational endpoints in tumor biopsies.
this phase ii trial used a two-stage design targeting an
objective response rate that can rule out 5% in favor of a
more desirable 20% response rate. patients with recurrent nsclc eastern cooperative oncology group
(ecog) performance status (ps) of 0 –1 with measurable disease who had received only one prior chemotherapy regimen were enrolled. sorafenib was administered
at 400 mg twice daily continuously on a 28-day cycle.
dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dce-mri) and tumor biopsy were performed before cycle 1 and at cycle 1, day 15 to study early changes
in tumor vascularity and translational endpoints. six patients were evaluable for toxicity and five for response.
best responses included one partial response with 41%
tumor reduction at week 8 that remained in partial response until week 28; one partial response (unconfirmed) observed at week 3; and two having stable
disease (16 and 19 weeks, respectively) and one progressive disease after 8 weeks of treatment. all skin toxicities
were grade 1 or grade 2 and responded to temporary
withdrawal of sorafenib and supportive care. grade 2 hypertension occurred in one patient (table 2). regarding

in an additional 27 patients (43%). a progression-free
survival of 11.3 weeks and median overall survival of
23.9 weeks were reported. the authors concluded that
sunitinib has provocative single-agent activity and is
well tolerated in previously treated patients with recurrent and advanced nsclc, with the level of activity similar to currently approved agents. the trial is being
extended to explore a continuous dosing strategy of
sunitinib at 37.5 mg/day p.o. as mentioned above, three
hemorrhage-related deaths were reported in this study.
the pulmonary events occurred in two patients with
squamous cell carcinoma (22% of the patients enrolled
in this study had squamous histology). in the near future, it will be interesting to compare the potential for
hemorrhagic toxicity, including the class effect of bleeding/thrombosis, sunitinib, and sorafenib versus bevacizumab. such a comparison will clarify whether the future
development of sorafenib and sunitinib in nsclc will
be limited to nonsquamous nsclc as for the other angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab [8].

sorafenib and sunitinib in nsclc

twenty-six patients (81%) demonstrated some degree of
tumor shrinkage, including four patients (13%; 95% ci,
4 –29) who demonstrated an objective partial response.
thus, sunitinib has substantial antitumor activity in bevacizumab-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients,
suggesting that sunitinib may inhibit signaling pathways involved in bevacizumab resistance. the precise mechanisms
of response to sunitinib in bevacizumab-refractory tumors
will require additional studies.
a very interesting preclinical model recently proposed
has suggested a possible clinical development of sunitinib
in the treatment of solid tumors, including nsclc. seeking
to improve efficacy against otherwise intractable end-stage
pancreatic islet tumors, two receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, imatinib and sunitinib, were used to disrupt pdgfrmediated pericyte support of tumor endothelial cells in
concert with maximum-tolerated dose (mtd) or metronomic chemotherapy and/or vegfr inhibition [62]. imatinib, despite equivocal efficacy as monotherapy, reduced
pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and enhanced efficacy
in combination with metronomic chemotherapy or vegfr
inhibition. a regimen involving all three proved even more
effective. the mtd using cyclophosphamide caused transitory regression but then rapid regrowth in contrast to metronomic cyclophosphamide plus imatinib, which produced
stable disease. the mtd regimen elicited apoptosis of tumor cells but not endothelial cells, whereas the other regimens increased endothelial cell apoptosis concordant with
efficacy. a “chemo-switch” protocol, involving sequential
mtd and then metronomic chemotherapy, overlaid with
multitargeted inhibition of pdgfr and vegfr, yielded
complete responses and unprecedented survival advantage
in this model. this study demonstrates a potentially tractable clinical strategy in a stringent preclinical model,
wherein standard-of-care chemotherapy is followed by a
novel maintenance regimen: pdfgr is targeted to disrupt
pericyte support, whereas metronomic chemotherapy
and/or vegfr inhibitors target sensitized endothelial
cells, collectively destabilizing pre-existing tumor vasculature and inhibiting ongoing angiogenesis.

conclusion
lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multiple mutations. it is unlikely that any one signaling pathway is driving the oncogenic behavior of tumors. with the exception
of rare cancers in which growth can depend upon a single
factor, selective targeted agents seem to have limited single-agent activity. this is fully in line with the concept that
for most tumors there are multiple factors driving tumor
growth. future drug development should focus on somewhat lessening selectivity. simultaneous targeted inhibi-

therapies, and single-agent therapy. two separate randomized phase iii trials of sorafenib plus chemotherapyversus chemotherapy alone are ongoing— one with
carboplatin plus paclitaxel as the chemotherapy regimen,
the other with cisplatin plus gemcitabine. a national
cancer institute-sponsored ecog trial of single-agent
sorafenib in previously treated patients with nsclc is
ongoing. this is a large, randomized discontinuation
study. moreover, several other phase i/ii studies are ongoing with sorafenib combined with various chemotherapeutic (irinotecan,  xxxd1796xxx , and gemcitabine) or
molecularly targeted (gefitinib) agents in advanced solid
tumors to maximize the therapeutic potential of the drug
[54 –58]. specifically, a phase i study of sorafenib plus
gefitinib, an egfr-tki, demonstrated that sorafenib
and gefitinib could be combined at full dose, 400 mg
twice daily, and 250 mg daily [56]. a phase i study of
sorafenib and  xxxd2029xxx  performed on 17 patients with advanced solid tumors showed that the recommended dose
for a phase ii trial was 400 mg twice daily for sorafenib
and 150 mg/day for  xxxd2029xxx , corresponding to the full
recommended doses of both agents, with acceptable toxicity [59]. our group recently launched a phase ii randomized trial of sorafenib plus gemcitabine and
sorafenib plus  xxxd2029xxx  in advanced nsclc elderly patients (⬎70 years) or with a ps of 2. given the positive
results obtained with bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced nsclc, both combined with chemotherapy and
with  xxxd2029xxx  [8, 9], the combination of bevacizumab
with sorafenib or sunitinib is of great interest. azad et al.
[60] performed a phase i dose-escalation study with the
combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced solid tumors. the authors theorized
that combining the two agents would have synergistic
therapeutic effects. in this trial, the combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab seemed to increase both clinical
effect and toxicity at recognized single-agent doses. the
suggested schedule for further study features 200 mg of
sorafenib twice daily on days 1–5 for 1 week and 5 mg/kg
bevacizumab for 2 weeks.
a possible future clinical development of sunitinib may
be in bevacizumab-resistant nsclc. some interesting data
have recently been reported for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. the activity of sunitinib in patients refractory to
vegf-binding agents such as bevacizumab has been evaluated in a phase ii study conducted in bevacizumab-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma [61]. it was
hypothesized that tumor resistance to bevacizumab might
be driven, in part, through pathways sensitive to inhibition
by sunitinib. thirty-two of 60 patients enrolled were evaluable for response; 28 patients were too early for assessment.

tion of multiple signaling pathways could be more effective
than inhibiting a single pathway in cancer therapies and
specifically in nsclc treatment. the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib can offer multiple targeted action with single-agent therapy; they have already
demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and gist, and their mechanism
of action and preclinical data in phase ii trials available to

date suggest that they may also play a major role in the treatment of nsclc in the near future.
