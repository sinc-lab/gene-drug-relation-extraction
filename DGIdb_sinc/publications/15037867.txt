central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) function has a role in a range of genetically
influenced psychiatric diagnoses and behaviors. several human 5-ht receptor polymorphisms
are ‘candidate alleles’, altering in vitro function, and potentially affecting behavior and drug
response. the 5-ht2a his452tyr polymorphism alters signal transduction, and has been
associated with diminished efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia. another  xxxg1113xxx 
polymorphism consists of the silent thymidine-cytosine substitution (102t4c), which has
been controversially associated with schizophrenia. we investigated the role of his452tyr and
the 102t4c in behavior and in vivo intermediate biochemical phenotypes. intracellular 5-htinduced ca2 þ release by platelets and fenfluramine-induced prolactin release by pituitary were
evaluated in 27 psychiatrically interviewed subjects (including both impulsive patients and
controls) stratified by his452tyr genotype and also genotyped for a second 5-ht2a
polymorphism, 102t4c. subjects with increased measures of impulsivity showed decreased
postreceptor 5-ht function, as indicated by reduced 5-ht-induced ca2 þ release, but no
alteration in net 5-ht function, as measured by fenfluramine response. no significant effects of
either polymorphism were associated with altered 5-ht-induced calcium response or
fenfluramine-stimulated prolactin release. one available tyr452/tyr452 homozygote had
diminished ca2 þ release and one of the highest levels of fenfluramine response. although
not statistically significant, the effect of the t102c, but not the his452tyr, genotype on
prolactin level change over time was associated with a medium to large strength of association
(treatment magnitude of t2 ¼ 0.10), suggesting that further study is warranted.

brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) function has been reported to have a role in a wide range
of behaviors and behavioral diseases including several that involve impulse control: binge eating, earlyonset alcoholism, major depressive disorders, suicide
attempts, and impulsive aggression in patients with a
wide range of psychiatric diagnoses.1 this heterogeneous array of disorders linked with reduced
central 5-ht functioning may be inter-related by the
general trait of irritable impulsivity.2,1 the mechanisms by which decreased 5-ht activity is tied to
impulsivity are, however, unknown as is the role of
variation of genes influencing serotonin function.
for the analysis of genetically influenced complex
behaviors and pharmacological responses, intermediate (mediating) neurobehavioral or biochemical phecorrespondence: dr c reist, department of psychiatry, long

notypes are invaluable to strengthen findings and
validate them mechanistically. 5-ht has a role in a
variety of genetically influenced complex disorders
and behavioral problems. these include several
behaviors that are at one end of the spectrum of
impulsivity, namely, binge eating, early-onset alcoholism, depression, suicide attempts, and unprovoked interpersonal violence. several of these
diseases or behaviors—that is, alcoholism, depression, binge eating, and suicide—are genetically
influenced, and the roles of two polymorphisms in
alcoholism vulnerability have even been confirmed,
namely,  xxxg73xxx  glu47lys and  xxxg132xxx  glu487lys.3 as
behavioral traits are complex and multifactorial,
linkages of several serotonin gene polymorphisms,
for example, the 5-ht1b serotonin receptor and
antisocial alcoholism,4 tryptophan hydroxylase and
suicidality,5 and the serotonin transporter and anxiety/dysphoria6,7 require verification and fuller explanation at the level of the physiology connecting gene
variant to complex behavior. serotonin receptors
and the serotonin transporter are also important

pharmacological targets in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. the  xxxg1113xxx  is important in the
mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic medication, while the serotonin transporter is the site of
action for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(ssri).
several naturally occurring variants of serotonin
receptors have been identified that may help explain
the heritability of behaviors associated with 5-ht and
shed light on the link between central 5-ht function,
psychopathology, and drug response. one polymorphism in the gene encoding the  xxxg1113xxx 
consists of a thymidine-cytosine substitution:
102t4c. although this substitution is silent (ie it
does not result in an alteration of the amino-acid
sequence of the 5-ht2a protein), it has been controversially associated with schizophrenia.8–10 a
second 5-ht2a variant is a histidine-tyrosine (histyr) missense substitution at amino acid 452 in the cterminal region of the receptor. pharmacological
investigation has shown that this variant is functional. although there is no significant difference in
radioligand binding to platelet 5-ht2a receptors, the
rarer (allele frequency 0.09) tyr452 allele shows
diminished signal transduction.11 the first studies
have been reported on the relationship of functional
genetic variation at these receptors to pharmacogenetic differences in drug response. collier et al12 have
summarized results supporting a relationship of
 xxxg1113xxx  his452tyr to clozapine response in schizophrenics. in this meta-analysis, 10 tyr452/tyr452
homozygotes were available; only two were clozapine
responders.
the neurobiology of serotonin directly predicts
several intermediate (mediating) phenotypes that
could be evaluated to better resolve the action of
genotypes. intermediate phenotypes for serotoninrelated behaviors include levels of serotonin and its
metabolites in csf and brain, physiological measures
such as body temperature, behavioral measures of
anxiety and impulsivity, endocrine measures including measures of drug response such as fenfluramine13
and m-cpp response, and direct measures of protein
concentrations in living or post-mortem brain. for
example, httlpr, a serotonin transporter promoter
polymorphism influencing in vitro gene transcription,
and reportedly involved in anxiety, was directly
correlated with in vivo serotonin transporter density
in vivo14 and in post-mortem brain.15
quantification of neurochemical consequences of
pharmacological challenge can evoke a response
reflecting ‘net’ or overall 5-ht activity. probes for
central 5-ht systems include 5-ht precursors, 5-htreleasing agents, selective 5-ht uptake inhibitors, and
direct 5-ht agonists and antagonists. fenfluramine
acts somewhat differently than the more recently
developed ssris in that it increases extracellular 5ht concentrations by both blocking 5-ht uptake and
reversing the usual outside-to-inside directionality of
the 5-ht transporter in the presynaptic membrane,
simultaneously releasing 5-ht and blocking its

molecular psychiatry

uptake.16–18 the resulting increases in extracellular
5-ht levels stimulate postsynaptic 5-ht2a receptors
in the anterior pituitary and, via an inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (ip3)/diacylglycerol-linked second messenger system, stimulate prolactin secretion, which
can be measured in peripheral blood samples. thus,
measurements of fenfluramine-induced prolactin release integrate both pre- and postsynaptic elements
and reflect net 5-ht functioning. although prolactin
response is mediated by a number of neurotransmitter
systems, the  xxxg1113xxx  is believed to play a
prominent role in fenfluramine-induced prolactin
release.
patients with violent suicidal and/or impulsive
aggressive behaviors have consistently been shown to
exhibit decreased fenfluramine-induced prolactin
release.13 convicted murderers with a diagnosis of
antisocial personality disorder,19 impulsive/aggressive patients with post-traumatic stress disorder,20
and men rated as highly aggressive21 exhibit impaired
fenfluramine-induced prolactin release. although the
association between decreased central 5-ht function
and impulsive aggression is usually observed in
patients diagnosed with a personality disorder, a
recent report indicates that heightened aggression and
impulsivity in a sample of normal men were significantly correlated with low fenfluramine-induced
prolactin response.22
a second useful strategy to assess components of
central 5-ht function is to examine these components
in more easily accessible peripheral locations. circulating blood platelets contain a functional 5-ht
signaling system that is largely identical to that in
the central nervous system. the sequence of the 5-ht
transporter is identical in human brain and platelets.23 similarly, the 5-ht2a receptors of human
platelets and frontal cortex have the same nucleotide
sequence24 as well as ligand binding profiles and
affinities.25 agonist binding to these 5-ht receptors
on the platelet surface activates the ip3 second
messenger system, leading to mobilization of cytosolic ca2 þ .26 in contrast to the assessment of ‘net’ 5-ht
function provided by measurements of fenfluramineinduced prolactin release, determination of agonistinduced ca2 þ release from platelets allows the
assessment of the function of postreceptor of 5-ht
signaling components.
a number of studies have shown that the treated
impulsivity as well as impulse-control-related disorders are correlated with measures of decreased
functioning in platelet 5-ht systems. 5-ht stimulation ca2 þ release has been shown to be increasingly
related to treatment of impulsivity.27 decreased radioligand binding to platelet 5-ht uptake sites has been
observed in patients with mental disorders characterized by hyperactive and/or aggressive behavior28 and
in individuals with personality disorders and high
life history of aggression and buss–durkee hostility
inventory (bdhi) assault scores.29 increased numbers
of 5-ht2a receptors have been correlated with assaultiveness in patients with personality disorders,30 and

5-ht2a genotypes and platelet ca2 þ release
c reist et al

with the degree of medical damage resulting from
suicidal acts.25 mcbride et al25 also found that the
ratio of 5-ht-amplified platelet aggregation (a response mediated by 5-ht2a receptors) to 5-ht2a
receptor number, an index of the responsivity
of platelet 5-ht receptors, was lower in suicide
attempters vs nonattempters or normal controls.
this suggests that alterations in the 5-ht2a-linked
second messenger signaling may have a role in
impulsivity.
in the present study, we examined impulsivity
scores, postreceptor 5-ht function (via 5-ht-induced
ca2 þ release from platelets), net 5-ht function (via
fenfluramine-induced prolactin release), and the
genotype of two  xxxg1113xxx  loci in a sample of
impulsive subjects and healthy volunteers.  xxxg1113xxx 
102t4c is an abundant polymorphism (rare allele
frequency 0.40), which is in near allelic identity with
a promoter polymorphism 1438, and both have been
associated with clozapine response in schizophrenics31 and psychopathology in the anxiety/dysphoria
domain. however, neither of these  xxxg1113xxx  polymorphisms is known to be functional.32  xxxg1113xxx  his452tyr is
a less common polymorphism (rare allele 0.09). this
polymorphism, however, does appear to alter signal
transduction,11 and the more poorly transducing
452tyr allele has been associated with diminished
response to clozapine in schizophrenics.31 we also
further investigated the possibility of relationships
between impulsivity, 5-ht genotype, and both peripheral and central measures of 5-ht function.

methods
subjects
the study was approved by the human subjects
committee of the long beach veterans affairs
healthcare system and was conducted prior to the
removal of fenfluramine from the market. all subjects
provided informed consent to participate. subjects
had participated in an earlier study in which
his452tyr genotype had been determined. efforts
were made to recruit subjects from this group who
were his452/tyr452 heterozygous and an agematched group who were his452/his452 homozygous. this resulted in the selection of 27 male
subjects. in all, 14 subjects (age 40710.7 years) were
graduates of a residential alcohol unit where they had
been sober for at least 8 weeks at the time of testing.
the remaining subjects were 13 nonpatient volunteers (age 41.4711.6 years) who did not have a history
of psychiatric disorder or other current illness. owing
to genotype selection, the frequency of the tyr452
allele in this data set was 0.23, as compared to 0.09, in
a caucasian population sample.11 102t4c and
his452tyr are not in significant linkage disequilibrium and subject selection was based on his452tyr,
so it is not surprising that the frequency of 102c was
0.52, and not significantly different from that previously observed in caucasians. baseline assessment
included a psychiatric and medical history, the

barratt impulsivity scale (bis-10), the brown–goodwin aggression questionnaire (bga), and the structured clinical interview for dsm-iii-r (scid ii)
personality disorder questionnaire. the scid ii
questionnaire was followed up with the scid ii
structured interview to establish the presence or
absence of a personality disorder. the 14 subjects
recruited from the residential program were diagnosed with alcohol dependence, but were free
of other axis i disorders and medical illness,
and were not receiving psychotropic medication.
of these subjects, 10 also met criteria for an axis ii
disorder.

procedures
on the test day, subjects were n.p.o. after midnight.
at 0800 a catheter was inserted in a forearm vein. as
parameters of 5-ht function in platelets have been
reported to vary according to the time of day,33 all
platelet blood samples were collected at 0830. these
samples were collected via the catheter into tubes
containing acid–citrate–dextrose (acd) anticoagulant. at 1000, subjects received d-fenfluramine
(30 mg, p.o.). blood samples were collected every
30 min beginning at 0930 and ending at 1500.
subjects were permitted to drink fluids during the
test period and remained in the research suite,
engaged in quiet activities.
neurochemical assays
platelet preparation: 5-ht-induced calcium response
was measured according to the method of mikuni et
al34 with slight modification. platelet-rich plasma
(prp) was prepared by centrifugation at 750  g for
3 min at room temperature (19–231c). platelet concentration was adjusted to 2  108/ml using krebs–
ringer–hepes buffer. final volume also was adjusted
to contain 20% acd. a prp aliquot was then
incubated with 3.0 mm fura 2-am (5-oxazolecarboxylic acid, 2-(6-(bis(2-((acetyloxy)methoxy)-2-oxoethyl)amino)-5-(2-(2-(bis(2-((acetyloxy)methoxy)-2oxoethyl)amino)-5-methylphenoxy)ethoxy)-2-benzofuranyl)-, (acetyloxy)methyl ester; molecular probes;
eugene, or, usa) for 20 min at 371c. after centrifugation (1750 rpm, 7.0 min, room temperature), the
platelet pellet was suspended in krh (1.5 ml final
volume). to facilitate resuspension of pellet, a volume
(14of final resuspension volume) of calcium-free krh
was added first, followed by normal krh to final
volume.
ca2 þ release assay: prp samples were added to a
prewarmed (371c), stirred quartz cuvette, and placed
in a perkin-elmer ls50b spectrofluorometer with
excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission detection
at 510 nm. 5-ht was added to produce a final
concentration of 10 mm. the rmax, defined as the
fluorescence ratio when the concentration of free fura
2-am is zero (ie at saturating ca2 þ levels), was
determined by adding triton which solubilizes the
membrane making it permeable to calcium. subsequently, rmin defined as the fluorescence ratio when

the concentration of ca2 þ -bound fura 2-am is
zero was obtained by chelating all free ca2 þ with
egta. intracellular calcium was calculated from the
ratio of emission intensities at two excitation
wavelengths according to grynkiewicz et al35 using
a kd of 224 nm.
fenfluramine-induced prolactin release: plasma
levels of fenfluramine and its principal metabolite,
norfenfluramine, were measured using gas chromatography with electrochemical detection.36 the lower
limits of detection were 2 ng/ml for fenfluramine and
3 ng/ml for norfenfluramine. plasma prolactin levels
were determined using a commercially available
radio immunoassay kit (diagnostic system lab
(dsl-10-4500)). the primary antibodies used were
specific for prolactin as shown by preabsorption and
crossreactivity assays by the manufacturer. the lower
limit for detection was 2 ng/ml (cv 8.7%).
5-ht genotypes: the polymorphisms were genotyped from genomic dna prepared from peripheral
blood as described previously.37 briefly, the 102t4c
and his452tyr polymorphisms were genotyped after
pcr amplification and using restriction enzyme
assays .38 the primer pairs for dna amplification
were: 102t4c, 50 -tac ttc ttt gag ctc aac tac
ga-30 and 50 -aca gga tgg tta aca tgg aca c30 ; his452tyr, 50 - xxxg889xxx  ttt gtt tgg atc ggt tat
ct-30 and 50 -cac aca gct cac ctt ttc att ca 30 .
these primer pairs amplify two regions of the 5-ht2a
gene that are 386 and 324 bp in size, respectively. samples were amplified for 30 cycles, each
consisting of 1 min at 951c, 1 min at 551c, and 1 min
at 721c in a solution containing [a33p]dctp and
digested with hinfi or ddei, respectively. genotypes
were scored following electrophoresis and autoradiography.
statistical analyses
platelet ca2 þ response: the effects of differing 5-ht
genotypes on 5-ht-induced ca2 þ release were evaluated using univariate analyses of variance. correlations between ca2 þ responses and measures of
impulsivity were determined using stepwise regression.
prolactin response and 5-ht genotype: two separate mixed analyses of variance were conducted on
the data. in each analysis genotype was used as a
between-subjects factor, while timed measurements of
circulating prolactin levels were a within-subjects
repeated measure. in the first analysis of variance
(anova), 102t4c was used as the predictor variable, while prolactin response was the dependent
variable. the second anova was carried out using
the his452tyr amino-acid substitution as the predictor variable and again prolactin secretion was the
dependent variable. subjects were classified as
homozygous or heterozygous his452/tyr452. as only
one subject was found to be homozygous tyr452/
tyr452, he was included in the heterozygous group.
for all statistical analyses, significance was defined at
an alpha level of 0.05.

results
serotonergic function and impulsivity
regression analysis showed that there was no
significant correlation between fenfluramine-induced
prolactin release and impulsivity (as measured by bis
(p ¼ 0.323) scores) or 5-ht-induced ca2 þ release
(p ¼ 0.266). there was, however, a significant inverse
correlation between platelet 5-ht-induced ca2 þ release and bis scores (r ¼ 0.503, p ¼ 0.008) (figure 1).
 xxxg1113xxx  genes
genotype frequencies for subjects at the two 5-ht2a
receptor gene loci are shown in tables 1 and 2. in
addition, the mean platelet calcium response, fenfluramine (including norfenfluramine) levels and
total scores for the bis are reported for each group.
t102c
the prolactin response to fenfluramine for each of the
102t4c genotypes is shown in figure 2. as a
violation in the assumption of sphericity was observed, the degrees of freedoms were adjusted by
multiplying them with the greenhouse–geisser epsilon (0.20). there was a significant main effect of time
on the prolactin response (f(2.19, 52.51) ¼ 23.46,
p ¼ 0.001). the treatment magnitude (t2) was 0.47
and the observed power was 1.0. no genotype by time
interaction was observed (f(4.38, 52.51) ¼ 1.90,
p ¼ 0.12). the treatment magnitude (t2) was 0.10
and the observed power was 0.56. univariate analysis
of covariance (ancova), with the calcium basal level
as the covariate, showed no significant effect of
102t4c genotype on 5-ht-induced ca2 þ release
from platelets (f(2,22) ¼ 0.99, p ¼ 0.39) and no correlation between t102t4c genotype and impulsivity.
no relationship between genotype and the presence
or absence of a personality disorder (t2(2) ¼ 0.64,
p ¼ 0.72) or substance abuse history (t2(2) ¼ 1.85,
p ¼ 0.40) was observed.

figure 1 5-ht-induced ca2 þ release (nm) was inversely

calcium response 1.3 sd below the mean of the group
homozygous for the wild 452 allele (table 2). in
contrast, the prolactin response was 1.2 sd higher
compared to this same group. although this is a
single point, it is suggestive of a unique physiology
associated with this relatively rare genotype. no
relationship between genotype and the presence or
absence of a personality disorder (t2(1) ¼ 0.56,
p ¼ 0.45) or the substance abuse history (t2(1) ¼ 0.05,
p ¼ 0.82) was observed.

discussion
in an effort to further investigate the inverse correlation between impulsivity (as measured by bis scores)
and 5-ht-induced ca2 þ release from isolated blood
platelets, the relationship of a functional 5-ht2a
polymorphism (his452tyr) to this measure and to
net serotonin function measured by fenfluramineinduced prolactin secretion has been studied. these
results could also shed light on the pharmacogenetics
of clozapine response, where the tyr452 allele has
been associated with diminished therapeutic efficacy.
however, like the pharmacogenetic studies where
significance emerged after the pooling of the rare
homozygotes across a number of studies, our intermediate phenotype findings are also limited by the
rarity of the tyr452/tyr452 genotype, which is found
in about 8/1000 individuals and in only one subject
available to us. while both measures of serotonin
function were relatively extreme in the tyr452/tyr452
homozygote, and intermediate in  xxxg1113xxx  his452/
tyr452 heterozygotes, these differences were not
statistically significant, indicating a need to evaluate
serotonin function in additional tyr452/tyr452
homozygotes. neither the t102c nor the his452tyr
polymorphisms of the  xxxg1113xxx  gene were
associated with variations in measures of impulsivity,
postreceptor 5-ht function, or net 5-ht function.
although a significant genotype (t102c) by prolactin level change over time interaction was not
observed, a treatment magnitude of t2 ¼ 0.10 was
observed, a medium to large strength of association.9
therefore, in order to observe a significant interaction
with the same mean difference between genotypes
over time as was obtained in this study with a power
of 0.80, a sample size of 42 was estimated (pearson–
hartley charts). in contrast, the omega squared for
genotype (his 452tyr) by prolactin change over time
was 0.03, a relatively small treatment magnitude.39
this suggests that further investigation may not
contribute further insights for the his452tyr genotype.
the lack of correlation between his452tyr genotype and 5-ht-stimulated ca2 þ release would at first
appear to be in conflict with ozaki et al,11 who found
significant blunting of the shape of the peak 5-htinduced ca2 þ release from platelets of individuals
with tyr452 without difference in ligand affinity or gmolecular psychiatry

protein coupling. however, the decreased peak
response seen by ozaki et al11 translated into a higher
sustained level of ca2 þ release over a longer time
course. thus, the total ca2 þ release 90 s after 5-ht
stimulation was virtually identical for both alleles,
consistent with the results of the present study where
ca2 þ release at this one time point was available.
observations of altered 5-ht function in patients
displaying impulsive aggression directed at self or
others are among the most replicated findings in
biological psychiatry.12 typically, indices of presynaptic 5-ht function have been reported to be
decreased in these patients. for example, decreased
5-hiaa levels in cerebrospinal fluid have been found
in impulsive, aggressive individuals,2 patients with
histories of suicide attempts,40 short-term abstinent
alcoholics,41 and alcoholic impulsive offenders with
either antisocial personality disorder or intermittent
explosive disorder.42 in contrast, postreceptor 5-ht
function has typically been found to be increased in
such individuals. increased radioligand binding to 5ht2a receptors has been reported in patients with
personality disorders and high assault scores,28 and
for patients with major depression and a history of
medically damaging suicidal acts.25 mcbride et al25
reported an increase in  xxxg1113xxx  binding in
depressed/suicidal patients and also determined the
ratio of 5-ht-amplified platelet aggregation to 5-ht2a
receptor number (an index of the mean responsivity
of an individual 5-ht receptor complex). they found
that although there were more 5-ht2a receptors in
suicide attempters vs nonattempters or normal controls, these receptors were less responsive to stimulation. consistent with this, the present study found a
significant inverse correlation between impulsivity
(as measured by bis scores) and 5-ht-induced ca2 þ
release in platelets.
although the subjects used in this study with high
impulsivity (as measured by bis scores) show
decreased postreceptor 5-ht function (as measured
by platelet ca2 þ responses), there was no correlation
between measures of impulsivity in this population
and net 5-ht function (as measured by fenfluraminestimulated prolactin release). in contrast to the results
of the present study, fenfluramine-stimulated prolactin release in impulsive, aggressive individuals has
been reported to be reduced. this may be due to the
fact that the impulsive, aggressive subjects in previous studies were patients with personality disorders, whereas not all of the subjects in the present
study were diagnosed with personality disorders. one
previous study has reported an inverse correlation
between fenfluramine-induced prolactin secretion
and impulsive aggression in a nonpatient sample.22
the subjects in the present study were not particularly aggressive by history as shown by their relatively
low bga scores (table 1), suggesting that impulsivity
specifically may involve postsynaptic 5-ht function
specifically, and the addition of personality disorders
and high aggression may involve more of the 5-ht
system.

5-ht2a genotypes and platelet ca2 þ release
c reist et al

in summary, the present study has shown that
subjects who show increased measures of impulsivity
(as measured by bis scores) exhibited decreased
postreceptor 5-ht function (as measured by 5-htinduced ca2 þ release from platelets), while their net
5-ht function (as measured by fenfluramine-induced
prolactin release) was not significantly affected. the
study is limited by small sample size and the possible
confound of substance abuse history in a portion of
subjects. definitive association of candidate alleles to
these intermediate phenotypes will require larger
samples of individuals with the relevant genotypes,
for example, 5-ht2a tyr452/tyr452. additional studies of the 5-ht2a tyr452 and his452 alleles in cells
expressing only these alleles may further clarify their
functional significance.
