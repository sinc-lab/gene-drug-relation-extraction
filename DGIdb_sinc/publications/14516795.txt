abstract
to define the mechanism of arsenite-induced tumor promotion, we examined the role of reactive oxygen species (ros) in the signaling
pathways of cells exposed to arsenite. arsenite treatment resulted in the persistent activation of p70s6k and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2) which was accompanied by an increase in intracellular ros production. the predominant produced appeared to be
h2o2, because the arsenite-induced increase in dichlorofluorescein (dcf) fluorescence was completely abolished by pretreatment with
catalase but not with heat-inactivated catalase. elimination of h2o2 by catalase or  xxxd68xxx  inhibited the arsenite-induced
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2, indicating the possible role of h2o2 in the arsenite activation of the p70s6k and the  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling
pathways. a specific inhibitor of p70s6k, rapamycin, and calcium chelators significantly blocked the activation of p70s6k induced by arsenite.
while the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitors  xxxd3536xxx  and  xxxd2523xxx  completely abrogated arsenite activation of p70s6k,
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenite was not affected by these inhibitors, indicating that h2o2 might act as an upstream molecule of pi3k as well
as  xxxg1369xxx /2. consistent with these results, none of the inhibitors impaired h2o2 production by arsenite. dna binding activity of ap-1,
downstream of  xxxg1369xxx /2, was also inhibited by catalase,  xxxd68xxx , and the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx , which significantly blocked
arsenite activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. taken together, these studies provide insight into mechanisms of arsenite-induced tumor promotion and
suggest that h2o2 plays a critical role in tumor promotion by arsenite through activation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 and p70s6k signaling pathways.

introduction
arsenic is ubiquitous in the environment, occurring
mainly as arsenite and arsenate [1]. it is released into the
environment during energy production from coal, oil shale,
and geothermal sources. epidemiological studies have
shown that chronic exposure to arsenic can result in liver

injury, peripheral neuropathy, and an increased incidence of
cancers of the kidney, lung, skin, bladder, liver, and colon
[2– 6]. while a single exposure to arsenic appears to be
nonmutagenic, arsenic potentiates the mutagenic effects of
short-wavelength uv radiation [7], suggesting that arsenite
acts as a tumor promoter in the carcinogenic process; however, the mechanism has not yet been defined.
activation of tumor cell proliferation requires transcriptional upregulation of the immediate early genes, as well as
an accelerated rate of translation of various genes, which are
regulated by intracellular activation of several signaling

protein kinase cascades [8, 9]. among them, two protein
kinase cascades, referred to as the  xxxg1369xxx /2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2) signaling pathway and the
p70s6k signaling pathway, have been demonstrated to be
responsible for the upregulation of transcription [10] and
translation in response to various growth factors [11], respectively. ligand-mediated dimerization of growth factors
triggers the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, resulting
in autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues [12,13], and
these residues then serve as docking sites for the recruitment
of downstream signaling mediators [14,15].
one of the signaling pathways bifurcating at the specific
docking sites of receptor  xxxg2198xxx  is the  xxxg1369xxx /2
signaling pathway consisting of grb2/sos, ras,  xxxg1924xxx ,
 xxxg1361xxx , and  xxxg1369xxx /2 [16]. activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 is responsible
for the phosphorylation of a variety of cellular proteins,
including downstream kinases and transcription factors that
are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the immediate early genes (e.g., c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos) [10]. the
other signaling pathway is the p70s6k pathway, which bifurcates at a growth factor receptor docking site distinct from
that of the ras/ xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway [17]. many studies, including point mutational analysis of platelet-derived growth
factor (pdgf) receptor [18], and the effect of various mutants of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) [19] and pkb
[20,21], and specific inhibitors of pi3k and fk506-rapamycin-associated protein (frap) on p70s6k activity [18,22]
have suggested that the p70s6k signaling pathway includes
pi3k, pdk1, pkb, and frap as upstream mediators of
p70s6k activity, although the function of pkb as a regulator of
the p70s6k signaling pathway has been challenged [23, 24]. the
major substrate of p70s6k appears to be the 40 s ribosomal
protein s6 [25], whose multiple phosphorylation in the cytosol
has been implicated in the selective translational upregulation
of a family of mrna transcripts that contain a polypyrimidine
tract at their 5⬘ transcriptional start site [26, 27].
dysregulation of the p70s6k pathway or  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway
through alterations in any one of several mediators involved
in the cascade can lead to cellular transformation [28,29].
indeed, many tumors exhibit elevated p70s6k [29] or
 xxxg1369xxx /2 [30,31] activity. it is not surprising, therefore, that
a common feature of known tumor promoters (e.g., phorbol
ester) is their ability to perturb the p70s6k or  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling pathway.
there is emerging evidence that reactive oxygen species
(ros) at low concentration may function as a signaling
intermediator of cellular responses [32,33]. the generation
of ros by external stimuli is associated with various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation [34] and apoptosis
[35]. ros have been shown to stimulate components of
signaling pathways implicated in growth factor and cytokine effects. the components include transcription factors,
nf-␬b [36], and ap-1 [37], as well as  xxxg1369xxx /2 [33,38,39]
and p70s6k [34], which play an important role in cell proliferation and various intracellular signaling pathways. arsenite has also been shown to cause a significant elevation

145

of p70s6k or  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity in rat cardiomyocytes and
pc12 cells [40,41]. furthermore, the production of ros in
response to arsenite treatment has been observed in various
cell lines [42,43], suggesting that arsenite may act early in
the growth factor signaling pathway. therefore, a better
understanding of the signal transduction pathway leading to
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation by arsenite could provide
important insight into its mechanism of tumor promotion. in
this report, we focused our attention mainly on the early
events in the signaling pathway leading to p70s6k and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, and provided evidence that arsenite
treatment results in the production of  xxxd2298xxx 
(h2o2), leading to the activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2. the
ability of arsenite to usurp this growth regulatory pathway
might likely contribute to its tumor promotion.

materials and methods
cell culture
jb6 cells (balb-c mouse epidermal cells) were cultured
in minimum essential medium (mem) containing 8% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°c in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere. cells were
serum deprived in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to
treatment with arsenite.
preparation of cell extracts
seventy-eight percent confluent cells were made quiescent by culturing them for 24 h in mem without fetal
bovine serum. serum-deprived cells were treated at 37°c
with arsenite for the indicated times. alternatively, cells
were pretreated for the indicated times at 37°c with serumfree mem containing egta (5 mm), bapta-am (20
␮m), catalase (300 units/ml, aspergillus niger), rapamycin
(5 nm),  xxxd3536xxx  (500 nm),  xxxd2523xxx  (25 ␮m), or
 xxxd1169xxx  (50 ␮m) before arsenite stimulation. after incubation, cells were rinsed twice with an ice-cold wash buffer
solution containing 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 120 mm
nacl, 20 mm naf, 1 mm edta, 5 mm egta, 10 mm
sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm  xxxd2822xxx , 1
mm  xxxd302xxx , and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then extracted in the same buffer containing 0.1%
nonidet p-40. cell extracts were collected with a plastic
scraper, homogenized, and cleared by centrifugation at 4°c
for 15 min at 12,000 rpm. aliquots of the supernatant were
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ⫺70°c.
immunoblotting
cell lysates were boiled in laemmli sample buffer for 5
min. cell lysates containing 50 ␮g of total protein were
subjected to sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(page) on 15% slab gels for the determination of p70s6k

and  xxxg1369xxx /2, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes were blocked for
30 min in tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% tween 20
and 5% (w/v) dry skim milk powder, and incubated overnight with anti-p70s6k and anti- xxxg1369xxx /2 antisera. the membranes were then washed with blocking solution and incubated for 90 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit igg as secondary antibody. bound antibodies
were detected with the enhanced amplified alkaline phosphatase immunoblot system (bio-rad).
immunoprecipitation and p70s6k activity assay
p70s6k was immunoprecipitated by incubating 20 ␮g
(total 200 ␮l) of protein/assay of cell extract to an antibody
directed to the c-terminal 18 residues of p70s6k for 2 h
incubation at 4°c. immunoprecipitation was facilitated by
the addition of protein a–sepharose (25 ␮l) for 30 min at
4°c on a shaking plate. the beads were then washed twice
at 4°c with an extraction buffer containing 50 mm tris–
hcl (ph 7.5), 120 mm nacl, 20 mm naf, 1 mm edta, 5
mm egta, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm pnitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm  xxxd302xxx , 0.1 mm pmsf,
and 0.1% nonidet p-40, and once with a dilution buffer
containing 50 mm mops (ph 7.0), 1 mm dtt, 5 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm  xxxd2822xxx , and 0.1% nonidet
p-40. p70s6k activity was assayed using the s6 peptide as a
substrate by incubating the immunoprecipitate for 30 min in
25 ␮l of reaction mixture containing 50 mm mops (ph 7.0),
5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm dtt, 10 mm  xxxd2822xxx ,
0.1% nonidet p-40, 0.6 ␮m pki, and 12 ␮m atp (plus
0.75 ␮ci [␥-32p]atp). the reaction was terminated by the
addition of 10 ␮l of 100 mm edta (ph 7.0). following a
brief centrifugation, the supernatant was spotted on p-81
paper. unincorporated [␥-32p]atp was eliminated by three
10-min washes in 5% phosphoric acid, and phosphorylated
s6 peptide bound to the paper was counted. assays were
carried out in duplicate. the results were calculated as units
of s6 kinase activity per milligram of protein lysate and
expressed as the fold increase over the control value. one
unit of activity represents the transfer of 1 pmol of 32pi into
s6 peptide per minute under the assay conditions.
measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species
cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days and serumfree mem for 1 day. the serum-deprived cells were stabilized in serum-free mem without phenol red for at least 30
min and stimulated with arsenite for different times. sometimes, cells were preincubated with various inhibitors of
protein kinases or antioxidants for 30 min before treatment
with arsenite. for the last 5 min of stimulation, 5 ␮m 2⬘,
7⬘-dichlorofluorescein (dcf) was added to monitor intracellular h2o2. then, the cells were immediately observed
with a laser scanning confocal microscope (carl zeiss lsm
410). the images of samples excited by a 488-nm argon

laser were filtered through a long-pass 515-nm filter. thirty
cells were randomly selected from each experiment and the
mean relative fluorescence intensity of each group of cells
was then measured with the karl zeiss vision system
(ks400, version 3.0).
electrophoretic mobility shift assay of activator protein 1
of ap-1
oligonucleotide probe containing the activator protein 1
(ap-1) binding site tgactca (12-o-tetreadecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element) was labeled with
[␣-32p] xxxd1148xxx  using klenow fragment. the sequences of
probe used in this work were 5⬘-ttg cgc atg act
cac-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘- xxxg889xxx  ggt gag tca tgc-3⬘ (antisense). binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min with 5 ␮g of nuclear protein in 20 ␮l of
binding buffer (10 mm hepes–koh, ph 7.7, 50 mm kcl,
2.5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm dtt, 10% glycerol, and 1 ␮g/ml
leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) containing 1 ␮g of poly[di– dc · di– dc] and 100,000 cpm 32p-labeled probe. the
specificity of the binding reaction was confirmed by competition assay with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled
oligonucleotide probe. dna–protein complex was separated from unbound probe on native 6% polyacrylamide
gels. after electrophoresis, the gel was vacuum-dried and
analyzed with the fluorescent image analyzer fla-2000
(fujifilm, japan).

results
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in response to arsenite
we have reinvestigated previous reports that arsenite
activates p70s6k [41] and  xxxg1369xxx /2 [40,44] to obtain kinetic
information. thus, mouse jb6 epidermal cells were treated
with various concentrations of arsenite and activity of
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 was measured. as shown in fig. 1,
arsenite treatment led to dose-dependent phosphorylation
and activation of p70s6k, as measured by its slower migration on western blots of one-dimensional sds–page and
immune complex kinase assay. an increase in p70s6k activity was apparent above 10 ␮m arsenite and maximum
p70s6k activity was observed at 100 ␮m (fig. 1a). the
increase in phosphorylation and p70s6k activity following
arsenite treatment was apparent as early as 10 min, with
maximum activity at 60 min, which was sustained longer
than 90 min (fig. 1b). similarly,  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation
was also dose-dependent and appeared from 10 min, with
maximal phosphorylation at 60 min, which was prolonged
up to 90 min (figs. 2a, b). therefore, the results presented
in figs. 1 and 2 not only confirm the earlier observations,
but also provide additional information on the kinetics of
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. the sustained activation of
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 with arsenite may be compared with the

cells [34]. as arsenite is known to produce ros [42,43], we
presumed that ros might play a role as a mediator in the
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 by arsenite. to determine
the possibility, we first examined whether ros were generated following treatment of jb6 cells with arsenite by
measuring the intracellular generation of ros with oxidation of the peroxide-sensitive fluorophore dcf. microfluorometric studies with laser scanning confocal microscopy
revealed that exposure of quiescent cells to arsenite resulted
in a dose-dependent increase in dcf fluorescence (figs.
3a, b). the increase in dcf fluorescence was apparent as
early as 10 min after the arsenite treatment, and maximum
production of ros was observed at 60 min, and was sustained for up to 90 min with a slight decrease (fig. 3c). the
arsenite-stimulated increase in dcf fluorescence was completely abolished by preincubation with catalase (figs. 4a,
b) which is taken up by an unknown mechanism across the
plasma membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells [33] as
well as jb6 cells [34]. however, pretreatment of jb6 cells
with heat-inactivated catalase did not affect arsenite-induced ros production, indicating that the predominant
ros produced was h2o2 (figs. 4a, b).
the dose response and time course of h2o2 production
were well correlated with those of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2
activation; suggesting a possible role of h2o2 in the arsenite-induced activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2. to further
confirm the role of h2o2 in arsenite-induced activation of
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2, we attempted to reduce intracellular
arsenite-induced h2o2 generation with antioxidants such as
catalase and  xxxd68xxx  (nac), a thiol-containing
compound, which nonenzymatically interacts and detoxifies
reactive electrophiles and free radicals [46]. when jb6 cells
were preincubated with catalase from aspergillus niger
fig. 1. p70s6k was activated by arsenite in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
(a) serum-deprived jb6 cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of arsenite for 60 min. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a
specific antibody for p70s6k and assayed for s6 kinase activity as described
under materials and methods. p70s6k activity was expressed as the fold increase over the control value. the results shown represent the means ⫾ sem
of three independent experiments. the levels of p70s6k phosphorylation in the
above-described cell lysates were monitored as slower migration of a family of
bands on sds–page and immunoblot analysis using a specific antibody for
p70s6k. (b) after treatment with arsenite (100 ␮m) for the indicated times in
serum-deprived jb6 cells, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and assayed
for s6 kinase activity as described under materials and methods. inset: levels

transient activation usually observed with growth factors
such as egf [45]. however, the magnitude of p70s6k activation by arsenite (about fivefold activation) is comparable
to that seen with egf [46].
involvement of intracellular h2o2 in arsenite activation
of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2
a recent study showed that h2o2 was able to mediate the
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 by growth factor in jb6

fig. 2.  xxxg1369xxx /2 was activated by arsenite in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
(a) serum-deprived jb6 cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of
arsenite for 60 min. (b) to examine the kinetics of arsenite activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2,
serum-deprived jb6 cells were treated with arsenite (100 ␮m) for the indicated
times. the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in arsenite-stimulated cell lysates was monitored
as slower migration of a family of bands on sds–page and immunoblot analysis
using a specific antibody for  xxxg1369xxx /2. results show a representative blot from
three independent experiments.

fig. 3. h2o2 was produced by arsenite in a dose- and time-dependent manner. jb6 cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days and serum-free mem for 1
day. the serum-deprived cells were stabilized in serum-free mem without phenol red for at least 30 min. (a) after treatment with the indicated
concentrations of arsenite (as) for 60 min, cells were incubated in the presence of 5 ␮m dcf for the last 5 min to monitor intracellular ros. dcf
fluorescence was measured with a confocal scanning laser microscope. results are representative photographs from three independent experiments. (b) thirty
cells were randomly selected from each of the experiments in (a), and fluorescence intensity was then measured with the karl zeiss vision system (ks400,
version 3.0) and averaged. fluorescence intensity of each group is expressed as the fold increase over the control value. data shown represent means ⫾ sem
of the fluorescence intensities of each group. (c) after treatment with arsenite (100 ␮m) for the indicated time, cells were incubated in the presence of 5
␮m dcf for the last 5 min to monitor intracellular ros. the fluorescence intensity is the mean ⫾ sem of three independent experiments.

(300 units/ml) or nac (30 mm) for 30 min, p70s6k phosphorylation and activity (fig. 4c), as well as  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation (fig. 4d), decreased: activation of p70s6k and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 was almost completely inhibited to near-basal levels. these results suggest that the sustained production of
h2o2 by arsenite could be responsible for the persistent
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2, thereby leading to tumor
promotion. consistent with these results,  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation
by arsenite has been demonstrated to be required for the
arsenite-induced cell transformation [47].
effect of calcium chelators on arsenite-induced p70s6k
activity
earlier studies showed that incubation of various cells
with compounds that increase intracellular calcium concen-

tration (ionophore a23187, thapsigargin) stimulates p70s6k
[48], and that pdgf- or h2o2-induced p70s6k activation is
ablated by ca2⫹ chelation [24,34], indicating a possible role
of ca2⫹ in regulation of p70s6k. however, the requirement
of ca2⫹ for  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation has been shown to vary with
individual cell types and stimuli [34,49,50]. we therefore
examined the possible involvement of ca2⫹ in arsenite
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2. when jb6 cells were
preincubated with either the extracellular calcium chelator
egta (5 mm) or the cell-permeant calcium chelator
bapta-am (20 ␮m), the activation and phosphorylation
of p70s6k by arsenite were completely inhibited (fig. 5a). in
comparison, neither egta nor bapta-am significantly
inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 (fig.
5b). these results indicate that the arsenite-stimulated

fig. 4. h2o2 was an intracellular mediator in arsenite activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2. (a) cells were pretreated with 30 mm nac, catalase (300 units/ml,
from aspergillus niger), or heat-inactivated catalase for 30 min before stimulation with 100 ␮m arsenite. results are representative photographs from three
independent experiments. (b) fluorescence intensity was measured and is expressed as the fold increase as described for fig. 3. (c) serum-deprived jb6 cells
were stimulated with arsenite (100 ␮m) for 60 min. alternatively, samples were preincubated with 30 mm nac or 300 units/ml catalase for 30 min. activity
and phosphorylation of p70s6k were measured as described earlier. the results shown are means ⫾ sem of three independent determinations. (d)
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was analyzed as described in fig. 2. nac,  xxxd68xxx .

p70s6k signaling pathway is intracellular calcium-dependent, whereas the arsenite activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 is not, in
jb6 cells. the requirement for ca2⫹ appeared to be downstream of h2o2, because pretreatment of jb6 cells with
egta and bapta-am did not cause any alteration of
h2o2 production by arsenite (figs. 7a, b). consistent with
these results, h2o2 stimulation of ca2⫹ release has also
been observed in rat-2 fibroblasts [51].
differential involvement of pi3k in arsenite-activated
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling pathways
in rat cardiomyocytes, it has been observed that arsenite
activation of p70s6k is inhibited by inhibitors of pi3k, indicating the possible involvement of pi3k in the activation
of p70s6k by arsenite [41]. although it has been suggested

that pi3k acts as an upstream molecule of h2o2 produced
by pdgf [52], this has been disputed, because exposure of
cardiomyocytes to h2o2 markedly increased pi3k activity
and tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit
[53]. thus, we further characterized the role of pi3k as well
as frap in arsenite-induced signaling pathways, using specific inhibitors for pi3k and frap. pretreatment of jb6
cells with  xxxd3536xxx  (500 nm) or  xxxd2523xxx  (25 ␮m)
completely inhibited arsenite activation and phosphorylation of p70s6k to almost basal levels (fig. 6a), indicating
the possible role of pi3k as a mediator of arsenite activation
of p70s6k. in constrast, the phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by
arsenite was not affected by pi3k inhibitors (fig. 6b),
indicating that pi3k was not required for activation of the
 xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling pathway by arsenite. neither  xxxd3536xxx 
nor  xxxd2523xxx  suppressed h2o2 production by arsenite

electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa). ap-1 dna
binding activity increased in a time-dependent manner, being apparent as early as 10 min after arsenite treatment, with
maximum activation occurring at 90 min, which was sustained for up to 120 min (fig. 8a). arsenite activation of
ap-1 was ablated by pretreatment with the mek inhibitor
 xxxd1169xxx , but not by specific inhibitors of the p70s6k signaling pathway— xxxd3536xxx ,  xxxd2523xxx , and rapamycin—indicating the role of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway as a mediator of ap-1 activation by arsenite (fig. 8b). furthermore,
ap-1 activation by arsenite was completely inhibited by
reducing h2o2 production through pretreatment of the cells
with antioxidants such as catalase and nac (fig. 8c). the
specificity of ap-1 dna binding was confirmed by a competition assay with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled
oligonucleotide probe (data not shown). taken together, the
results suggest that arsenite activation of ap-1 is mediated
by h2o2-induced erk 1/2 activation.

discussion
fig. 5. arsenite activation of 70s6k was mediated by the intracellular ca2⫹
signaling pathway. serum-deprived jb6 cells were stimulated with 100
␮m arsenite for 60 min. alternatively, samples were preincubated with 5
mm egta or 20 ␮m bapta-am for 30 min. (a) the activity and
phosphorylation of p70s6k were assayed as described in fig. 1. the results
shown represent the means ⫾ sem of four independent experiments. (b)
phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was determined as described in fig. 2.

recently, ros such as h2o2 and superoxide have gained
acceptance as modulators of receptor-mediated signal transduction in a variety of cell types [56]. we have recently

(figs. 7a, b). these observations further support the notion
that pi3k acted downstream rather than upstream of h2o2
produced by arsenite, because arsenite activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
would be inhibited by the decrease in h2o2 by pi3k inhibitors, if pi3k acted as an upstream molecule of h2o2. the
frap-specific inhibitor rapamycin at 5 nm significantly
inhibited arsenite-induced p70s6k activity, indicating the involvement of frap in arsenite activation of p70s6k. pretreatment of jb6 cells with the mek-specific inhibitor
 xxxd1169xxx  (50 ␮m) significantly inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, but had no effect on p70s6k activity at the same concentration (figs. 6a, b). therefore, arsenite stimulation of
p70s6k appears to be mediated through pi3k and frap.
requirement of h2o2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 for induction of
activator protein 1 activity by arsenite
it is known that arsenite stimulates transcription factor
ap-1 activity through the mitogen-activated kinase cascade
in several cell systems [47,54,55]. ap-1 mediates many
biological effects of tumor promoters and is an important
regulator of cell growth. we therefore investigated the possible role of h2o2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in stimulation of ap-1
activity by arsenite, and measured the change in ap-1 binding affinity following treatment with 100 ␮m arsenite by

fig. 6. the p13k signaling pathway was differentially involved in arsenite
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2. serum-deprived jb6 cells were stimulated with 100 ␮m arsenite for 60 min. alternatively, the cells were
preincubated with 50 ␮m  xxxd1169xxx , 5 nm rapamycin, 500 nm  xxxd3536xxx , or 25 ␮m  xxxd2523xxx  for 30 min. (a) activity and phosphorylation of
p70s6k, and (b) phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 were assayed as described
earlier. the results shown are the means ⫾ sem and typical representative
blot of three independent experiments.

fig. 8. ap-1 activation was mediated by the arsenite-activated h2o2–
 xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling pathway. (a) serum-deprived jb6 cells were stimulated
with 100 ␮m arsenite for the indicated times. nuclear extracts were
prepared, and dna binding activity of ap-1 was determined by emsa as
described under materials and methods. the positive control sample was
stimulated with 10% serum for 20 min. (b) to determine the signaling
pathway involved in arsenite activation of ap-1, serum-deprived jb6 cells
were pretreated with 50 ␮m  xxxd1169xxx , 5 nm rapamycin, 500 nm  xxxd3536xxx , or 25 ␮m  xxxd2523xxx  for 30 min. after stimulation with 100 ␮m
arsenite for 90 min, nuclear extracts were prepared and dna binding
activity of ap-1 was determined by emsa. (c) to elucidate the involvement of h2o2 in arsenite activation of ap-1, serum-deprived jb6 cells
were pretreated with nac (30 mm) or catalase (300 units/ml) for 30 min.
after stimulation with 100 ␮m arsenite for 90 min, dna binding activity
of ap-1 was determined by emsa.

demonstrated that the generation of h2o2 is required for
pdgf- and egf-induced activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2
[34]. in addition, arsenite has been shown to produce ros
as well as to activate p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 [40 – 43]. however, none of the previous studies linked the activation of
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 to ros production in arsenite-stimulated cells. in the present study, we provide direct evidence
for this linkage. arsenite was found to induce activation of
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2. however, this response differed from
the ligand-induced response. while endogenous stimuli
such as egf have been demonstrated to cause transient
activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 [45], arsenite induced
sustained activation of these kinases (fig. 1, 2). consistent
with our observation, persistent activation (for up to 45 min)
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by arsenite has been shown in urotsa cells, an
sv40 immortalized human urothelium cell line [57]. the
prolonged activation of these kinases by arsenite could be
important in progression of the cell cycle, thereby leading to

continued cell proliferation. these findings are in good
agreement with other observations that p70s6k activity remains maximally activated for up to 14 h after serum induction, a time just before the cells first enter s phase [58].
furthermore, microinjection of quiescent rat embryo fibroblasts with polyclonal antibodies against p70s6k during the
first 10 h after serum induction totally abrogated entry of the
cells into s phase, indicating that p70s6k function was essential throughout g1 phase. in support of the above observation, p70s6k was also found to be constitutively activated
in small cell lung cancer cells [29]. pretreatment of the cells
with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of p70s6k, inhibited
growth of the cells at concentrations similar to those required for inducing inactivation of p70s6k [29]. thus, the
prolonged activation of p70s6k by arsenite would play an
important role in promoting the growth of cancer cells.
in addition to the ability to activate p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2,
arsenite has been implicated in production of ros [42,43].
in fact, arsenite induced time- and dose-dependent production of ros. the kinetic pattern of ros production by
arsenite was very similar to that of activation of p70s6k and
 xxxg1369xxx /2, indicating a possible link between ros production
and activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2: arsenite activation of
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 was completely inhibited by antioxidants. furthermore, the major ros produced by arsenite
appeared to be h2o2, because arsenite-induced production
of ros was significantly abolished by pretreatment with
catalase but not with heat-inactivated catalase. mutational
analysis of pdgf␤r has demonstrated that pi3k is required
for pdgf-induced production of h2o2, indicating the role
of pi3k as an upstream molecule of h2o2 [52]. however,
contrary to the above, we earlier demonstrated that h2o2
acted as an upstream molecule of pi3k, frap, and ca2⫹ in
the p70s6k signaling pathway [34]. consistent with this
observation, specific inhibitors for pi3k, frap, or ca2⫹
chelators abrogated arsenite activation of p70s6k without
any alteration of h2o2 production, thus indicating pi3k,
frap, and ca2⫹ as downstream effectors of h2o2 in arsenite signaling leading to p70s6k activation. if pi3k acted
as an upstream molecule of h2o2, inhibition of pi3k by
specific inhibitors would induce inactivation of p70s6k as
well as  xxxg1369xxx /2, because no h2o2 would be produced.
however, inhibition of pi3k failed to inactivate  xxxg1369xxx /2,
confirming pi3k as a downstream effector of h2o2, this
possibility is further strengthened by an earlier observation
that exposure of cardiomyocytes to h2o2 led to sustained
activation of pi3k as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of
the p85 regulatory subunit [53].
several lines of evidence have demonstrated that arsenite
may act early in the growth factor signaling pathway. in
particular, arsenite activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in rat pc12 cells
through ras-dependent signaling [40], and stimulated  xxxg2198xxx 
activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins
including the proto-oncoprotein shc and egf receptor [40,
57]. these effects of arsenite were antagonized by anitioxidant, indicating that effects of arsenite on early growth

d.k. jung et al. / experimental cell research 290 (2003) 144 –154

factor signaling might be mediated by a ros which appeared to be h2o2, because production of ros by arsenite
was completely abolished by catalase treatment (fig. 4a).
furthermore, h2o2 has also been shown to cause phosphorylation of growth factor receptors [53]. in support of the
above observation, activation of p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 by
arsenite was significantly inhibited by treatment with the
protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor genistein (unpublished
data).
epidemiological studies have revealed that many skin
cancers occur among people medically or occupationally
exposed to arsenite and that high exposure to arsenite
through drinking water is associated with increased risk of
skin, bladder, kidney, lung, and colon cancers [6,59]. consistent with these observations, chronic exposure of cultured
cells to low concentrations of arsenic leads to transformation [60]. furthermore, mice exposed to 0.01% arsenite in
drinking water develop hyperplasia of the bladder urothelium within 4 weeks of exposure [61]. one possible explanation of its tumor-promoting properties in humans, animals, and cultured cells could be activation of early events
in the growth factor signaling pathway by sustained production of h2o2 by arsenite. h2o2 produced by arsenite might
activate growth factor receptor by increasing its tyrosine
phosphorylation, thereby leading to stimulation of the
p70s6k and  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathways, which are critical signaling
events for cell proliferation [10,11], strongly indicating
h2o2 to be a pivotal mediator of the tumor-promoting
activity of arsenite. finally, our findings presented herein
provide one of the mechanisms for the tumor-promoting
properties of arsenite and suggest h2o2 as a potential target
for therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or inhibiting
arsenite-induced tumor growth.
