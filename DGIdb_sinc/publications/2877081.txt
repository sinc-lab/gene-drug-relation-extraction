actions of  xxxd2744xxx , a selective histamine h2-receptor antagonist, on gastric acid secretion in dogs, rats and frogs.   xxxd2744xxx  (ly139037), a selective histamine h2-receptor antagonist, is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. it was 17.8 times as active as cimetidine on histamine (10(-5) m)-induced secretion from the isolated gastric mucosa of the bullfrog.  xxxd2744xxx  was 8.9 times as active as cimetidine on basal acid secretion of the chronic gastric fistula rats after s.c. administration. against acid secretion from the vagally innervated gastric fistula and heidenhain pouch of dogs stimulated with submaximal doses of histamine,  xxxd2586xxx  and gastrin,  xxxd2744xxx  was, respectively, 6.5, 5 and 4.7 times as active as cimetidine by i.v. administration.  xxxd2744xxx  was very well absorbed from the gut and was 5 to 10 times as active as cimetidine on gastric acid secretion of dogs induced by submaximal and maximal doses of histamine when given p.o. equal molar doses of  xxxd2744xxx  showed equal peak effects when given i.v., s.c. or i.m. pharmacological data indicate that  xxxd2744xxx  is safe and effective as an agent for the control of excessive gastric acid secretion.
