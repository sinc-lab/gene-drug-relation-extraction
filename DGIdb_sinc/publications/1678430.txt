inhibitory effects of various histamine receptor-blocking agents including antiallergic agents
on metabolic activations of neutrophils were examined by measuring leukotrienes (c,, d, and e,)
formation,  xxxd208xxx  release and superoxide generation. the stimulation of neutrophils by
calcium ionophore (a23187) causes the production of leukotrienes concomitantly with the release
of  xxxd208xxx  from the cells and these were effectively diminished with a variety of antihista-
minic agents. almost all the histamine h, receptor-blocking drugs studied here showed as inhibi-
tors of the metabolic activations of neutrophils, although the degree was dependent on the drug
concentrations. the order of potency of the inhibitory effects on the  xxxd208xxx  release were:
homochlorcyclizine, clemastine, and azelastine (c.y)<20 ¢m)>oxatomide (ic,,<60 pm) and
 xxxd1910xxx  > triprolidine, meclizine, diphenhydramine (ic. > 100 pm). the superoxide gener-
ation from neutrophils activated by  xxxd2925xxx  was also effectively inhibited
by these agents, but generally lower concentrations were required to obtain the same degrees of ef-
fects. these results indicated that some of the histamine h, receptor-blocking drugs, such as
clemastine and homochlorcyclizine, may act as inhibitors of formation of leukotrienes at the locus

of inflammation.

introduction

in the process of allergic reactions, a variety
of substances are released as ‘‘chemical media-
tors’’ including histamine, serotonin, bradykinin
and leukotrienes (lts).'”) histamine released
from mast cells is one of the major substances
in the allergic response so that a number of hista-
mine receptor-blocking agents have been used for
immunoglobulin e (ige) dependent type i aller-
gy. leukotrienes including ltb,, ltc4, ltd,
and lte, can also be produced in allergen in-
duced asthma by a variety of cells, such as mast
cells, basophils and neutrophils. since lts pos-
sess a potent vasocontracting activity and cause
contraction of bronchial air way,** they are
now known to be playing an important role in
immediate hypersensitivity of allergic broncho-
contraction and vascular permeability.°-? thus,
the development of inhibitors of lt release in
vivo became of therapeutic relevance, and such
drugs are now classified as ‘‘antiallergic agent.”’
recently, there has been increased interest in
newly developed antiallergic drugs, such as

ketotifen and azelastine which are known to be
inhibitors of chemical mediator release, with a
histamine h, receptor-blocking property. '-!
we have previously demonstrated that these an-
tiallergic drugs diminish the liberation of arachi-
donic acid from human neutrophils resulting in
the decrease of formation of ltb,.!”

in patients with chronic rhinitis, on the other
hand, h, receptor antagonists play an impor-
tant role in relieving the symptoms of sneezing,
itching, and rhinorrhea, so that classical hista-
mine receptor-blocking agents, such as  xxxd1906xxx -
 xxxd1906xxx , chlorpheniramine and clemastine,
have been widely applied for rhinitis, such as hay
fever, to decrease the allergic inflammation
process.!4!5) the first-generation h, receptor
antagonists are effective for treatments of aller-
gic reactions, but there are some discussions as
to whether histamine acts on neutrophils medi-
ated through h, receptors.!*-!® thus, we at-
tempted to examine the inhibitory effects of
various histamine receptor-blocking agents on
the release of lts,  xxxd208xxx  and superox-
ide anion from activated human neutrophils.

labelled cells (5 x 10° cells/0.5 ml) were prein-
cubated with or without drugs at 37°c for 5 min.
the reaction were started by addition of 2 um
of a23187 and then carried out for a further 10
min before termination by the addition of 1.75
ml of methanol—chloroform (2:1, v/v). extrac-

results

to study the inhibitory effects on metabolic
activation of neutrophils, we employed various
histamine receptor blocking drugs, such as
diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, tripelenna-
mine,  xxxd1910xxx , homochlorcyclizine,
meclizine, triprolidine,  xxxd3050xxx , clemastine,
azelastine and oxatomide. sites of the inhibito-
ry actions of the drugs on neutrophils were exa-
mined by means of measurements of arachidonic
acid release, superoxide anion generation and
srs (ltc,, ltd, and lte,) formation. hu-
man neutrophils were isolated and activated by
a23187 and pma for the assays of arachidonic
acid release or srs formation and the superox-
ide anion generation, respectively. the effects of

tion are summarized in table i where the inhibi-
tory effects are expressed as a percent of
remaining activity from a control activity ob-
tained from the stimulated neutrophils in the ab-
sence of drugs. as shown in the method section,
100% activities of the  xxxd208xxx  release
and the superoxide generation were 6184+ 1717
dpm/5 x 10° cells and 6.63+1.12 nmol/min/

 xxxd208xxx  release, the cells were prein-
cubated with or without drugs for 5 min before
the addition of stimuli and incubated for futher
10 min. the activity of superoxide generation
was estimated from the maximum rate observed
in 15 min.

as shown in table i, the  xxxd208xxx 
release as well as the superoxide generation from
neutrophils were effectively diminished by the all
histamine h, receptor-blocking agents, except
meclizine, at the concentration of 100 um. we
also examined a representative histamine h,

preciable effects on the metabolic activations
cimetidine were not seen at 1 mm, the results
were excluded from the table i. the most effec-

of  xxxd208xxx  at the end of incubations in
the presence of clemastine or homochlorcyclizine
and a23187 were less than releases of un-
challenged neutrophils. in such cases, the data
are expressed as negative values (see table i).
cell viabilities in the presence of drugs were
measured by the trypan blue exclusion test and
the results are expressed as a percent of trypan
blue negative cells. in the absence of drugs, the
control value of trypan blue exclusion was 95%.
although the cell viabilities were not significantly
increased by the most agents, some cytotoxic ef-
fects were seen by 100 um of homochlorcyclizine
and clemastine.

the dose dependence of the effects on arachi-
donic acid release were examined using the
a23187 treated neutrophils. as seen in fig. 2,
the order of potency was azelastine, clemastine,
homochlorcyclizine,  xxxd1910xxx  and oxato-
mide and their icsos were 14, 18, 23, 50 and 50
um, respectively.  xxxd1891xxx  um, the significant inhi-
bitions of  xxxd208xxx  release were observed

the neutrophils activated by pma generating su-

dependent curves were observed by the same
drugs as examined for the  xxxd208xxx 
release. although the order of potency of the
drugs were almost similar to the results obtained
in fig. 2, generally these drugs were more effec-
tive on superoxide generation than on the arachi-
donic acid release. as seen in fig. 3, ics9s of
azelastine, clemastine and homochlorcyclizine
were 0.6, 6 and 6 pm, respectively.

these three drugs were furthermore examined
by means of the inhibitory effects on the release
of lts from neutrophils activated by a23187.
as can be seen in fig. 4, clemastine, azelastine
and homochlorcyclizine diminished the lts for-
mations in the drugs concentration range of
20—100 pm.

discussion

although it has been well established that
mast cells and basophiles are playing central roles
in type i reaction of allergy, recent therapy for
allergic disease puts more emphasis on the regu-
lation of lts released. one of the major dona-
tors of the  xxxd208xxx  metabolites including
lts is now known to be neutrophils.” in our
previous studies, we have shown that the forma-

tion of ltb, and metabolic activations in hu-
man neutrophils were effectively diminished by
newly developed so-called ‘‘antiallergic drugs,”’
such as oxatomide, azelastine, repirinast and am-
lexanox.!?) among these drugs, oxatomide and
azelastine have unique properties possessing the
histamine h, receptor-blocking action as well as
the inhibitory action of lts formation.

classical antihistamines are also widely used
for the treatment of mild allergic rhinitis. recent
investigations revealed that  xxxd236xxx  and
oxatomide inhibited releases of lts and throm-
boxane b,.*) therefore, we thought it worth-
while to examine the effects of various histamine
h, receptor-blocking drugs on the metabolic
responses of human neutrophils including su-
peroxide generation,  xxxd208xxx  release,
and ltc,4, dy and e, (srs) formations. as
summarized in table i and shown in fig. 2, the
most effective drugs as inhibitors of arachidon-
ic acid release from human neutrophils are
clemastine, homochlorcyclizine and azelastine.
these drugs are also able to diminish the produc-
tion of srs from the cells stimulated by a23187.
although azelastine is classified as an antialler-
gic drug which diminishes srs formation,
clemastine and homochlorcyclizine are not
known as inhibitors of srs production. as
demonstrated in this study, the latter two drugs
are also capable of inhibition of  xxxd208xxx 
release as well as srs formation at similar con-
centrations of azelastine.

to elucidate the inhibitory activities, there are
several lines of possibilities; (i) the antihista-
mine’s action on neutrophils is mediated through
h, or h), receptors, (ii) the membrane is
stabilized by the drugs, or (iii) the amine group
in their molecules inhibit the metabolic activa-
tion process. in spite of the possibility that the
antihistaminic drugs act on the specific receptors,
we assume that the inhibitory action of these
drugs on the metabolic burst may not be due to
the inhibition of histamine receptors of neu-
trophils. one of the major reasons is that con-
centrations of drugs attained during therapy are
less than 100 nm and the in vitro study here in-
dicates that neutrophil function is altered by over
1 um. we also would like to omit the possibility
of an anticholinergic effect on the metabolic

k. taniguchi, ef al.

burst of neutrophils, since azelastine does not an-
tagonize acetylcholine.*) since some typical
membrane stabilizing agents, such as procaine
and quinidine, are ineffective on neutrophils
functions,”!*© we would like to rule out a pos-
sibility of a so-called ‘‘membrane stabilization
effect’’. amine and aromatic groups in the for-
mula are thought to be playing an important role
to diminish a membrane fluidity as well as a
membrane potential.!??’?8 the results demon-
strated here can be elucidated with the results
shown by miyahara et al. where they showed that
a charged moiety of the neutrophils play a key
role in the metabolic activation of neu-
trophils.*?) furthermore, we as well as others
have reported recently that the metabolic acti-
vation of neutrophils can be inhibited by vari-
ous cationic drugs and restored by anionic
drugs.*°30 therefore, the inhibitory effects of
the histamine h, receptor-blocking drugs on
neutrophils observed in this study can be eluci-
dated by their cationic properties.

as shown in fig. 1, histamine h, receptor-
blocking drugs have amine group in their
molecules with various side chain formula. typi-
cal side chains are amino-ethyl-ether type,
propylamine type, and aminopropylether type in
diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and
clemastine and  xxxd1910xxx , respectively.
amine groups in oxatomide, azelastine,
clemastine, homochlorcyclizine and diphenyl-
pyraline are situated within their ring construc-
tion. in any case, the amine group in the
histamine h, receptor-blocking drugs could be
an important element in the inhibition of the
metabolic responses of human neutrophils.
although the structure—action relationship re-
mains to be examined, it is worth noting that
some of these drugs are potentially powerful in-
hibitors of chemical mediator release from neu-
trophils. some of clinically employed histamine
h, receptor-blocking drugs used for long peri-
ods or at high concentrations can diminish phys-
iological responses of neutrophils, which might
be reflected in the drug action of the histamine
h, receptor-blocking agents.
