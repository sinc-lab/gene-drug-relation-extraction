the beta 2 -adrenoceptor (beta 2 -ar) agonists clenbuterol and  xxxd2098xxx  have similar beneficial effects
in animal models of heart failure. however, large doses of clenbuterol can induce cardiomyocyte
death, and it is not known which of these agents has the most favourable therapeutic profile. we
have investigated the cardiotoxicity of clenbuterol and  xxxd2098xxx  alongside that of  xxxd2398xxx ,
and compared their haemodynamic effects. wistar rats (n = 6 per group) were subcutaneously
injected with each beta-agonist (0.003–3 mmol kg−1 ) or saline, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was
detected by  xxxg341xxx  immunohistochemistry. in a separate experiment, rats (n = 4) were given
equivalent doses to those used in the myotoxicity studies, in a randomized cross-over design,
and their blood pressure recorded via radiotelemetry. injection of 0.3 mmol kg−1  xxxd2098xxx  or
 xxxd2398xxx , but not clenbuterol, induced significant cardiomyocyte apoptosis (0.4 ± 0.05%;
p < 0.05). at 3 mmol kg−1 , all agonists induced apoptosis ( xxxd2098xxx , 1.1 ± 0.1%;  xxxd2398xxx ,
0.9 ± 0.8%; and clenbuterol, 0.4 ± 0.07%; p < 0.05). beta 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism (10 mg kg−1
bisoprolol) prevented 92% (p < 0.05) of apoptosis induced by all three agonists, but clenbuterolinduced apoptosis could also be prevented by 96% (p < 0.05) by beta 2 -ar antagonism (10 mg kg−1
ici 118 551). clenbuterol decreased diastolic (1.3- to 1.6-fold; p < 0.05) and systolic blood
pressure (1.3-fold; p < 0.05), and doses > 0.3 mmol kg−1 increased heart rate (1.4-fold;
p < 0.05).  xxxd2098xxx  increased heart rate (1.2- to 1.4-fold; p < 0.05), and doses > 0.3 mmol kg−1
decreased diastolic blood pressure (1.3-fold; p < 0.05). in conclusion, the cardiotoxicity of
 xxxd2098xxx  was similar to  xxxd2398xxx  and greater than clenbuterol, and  xxxd2098xxx  had less desirable
haemodynamic effects.

the cardiotoxicity of endogenous catecholamines and
their synthetic analogue,  xxxd2398xxx , is widely recognized
(mann et al. 1992; communal et al. 1998; ng et al.
2002; goldspink et al. 2004). mann et al. (1992) revealed
this cardiotoxicity to be mediated by the beta-adrenergic
receptor (beta-ar), and later work by communal et al.
(1999) showed that it is the beta 1 - rather than beta 2 -ar that
mediates beta-agonist-induced cardiomyocyte death. this
difference results from disparate subcellular signalling of
beta 1 - and beta 2 -ar, and this has been extensively studied in
vitro (communal et al. 1999; zaugg et al. 2000; xiao et al.
2003; communal & colucci, 2005). beta 1 -adrenoceptors

cardiomyocyte apoptosis via camp and ca2+ entrydependent mechanisms, whereas, beta 2 -ar couple with both
 xxxg2224xxx  s and the pertussis toxin (ptx)-sensitive inhibitory
g protein ( xxxg2224xxx  i ) and do not induce cardiomyocyte
apoptosis in vitro (communal & colucci, 2005). for the
most part, the observations in vitro are substantiated by
studies using genetically manipulated animals, confirming
that elevated beta 1 -ar signalling (15-fold overexpression of
the beta 1 -ar) induces cardiomyopathy (engelhardt et al.
1999), whereas, 60-fold overexpression of the beta 2 -ar is
not detrimental (liggett et al. 2000). based on this body
of evidence, there is growing interest in the therapeutic
potential of beta 2 -ar agonists for the treatment of heart

failure. for example, in addition to their more wellestablished anabolic effects (yacoub, 2001; soppa et al.
2005), beta 2 -agonists have been proposed as a potential antiapoptotic therapy (ahmet et al. 2004; xydas et al. 2006)
and a means of providing inotropic support to the failing
heart (xiao et al. 2003).
it is important to recognize, however, that studies
in vitro and transgenic models are not analogous to
the proposed therapeutic use, in which exogenous beta 2 ar agonists would be given in vivo. we have shown
that administration of the beta 2 -agonist clenbuterol in vivo
induces myocyte death in cardiac and skeletal muscle
(burniston et al. 2002; burniston et al. 2005e). our findings
do not contradict those of studies in vitro. in fact, our
work using wild-type animals confirms that apoptosis
is induced by stimulation of the cardiomyocyte beta 1 -ar.
when clenbuterol is given in vivo, however, its stimulation
of beta 2 -ar of the peripheral vasculature and sympathetic
nervous system potentiates noradrenaline release from the
sympathetic varicosities, and this is sufficient to stimulate
cardiomyocyte beta 1 -ar and induce apoptosis (burniston
et al. 2005e). therefore, the use of exogenous beta 2 -agonists
as a therapy for heart failure, or other chronic diseases,
needs to be considered carefully.
recently, clenbuterol (xydas et al. 2006) and another
commonly investigated beta 2 -ar agonist,  xxxd2098xxx  (ahmet
et al. 2004), have each been shown to have beneficial effects
on the myocardium of animals subjected to coronary
artery ligation. since  xxxd2098xxx  has been reported to be
a more potent anabolic agent than clenbuterol (ryall et al.
2002),  xxxd2098xxx  may be the preferred therapeutic option.
however,  xxxd2098xxx  stimulates the beta 1 -ar as well as the
beta 2 -ar (hoffmann et al. 2004), and its stimulation of
the beta 2 -ar is selectively mediated via the  xxxg2224xxx  s pathway
(xiao et al. 2003), which is similar to the pro-apoptotic
beta 1 -ar signalling pathway. therefore, we hypothesized
that, when given to whole animals in vivo,  xxxd2098xxx  will be
more myotoxic and have less favourable haemodynamic
effects than clenbuterol. to test this hypothesis, we first
measured the incidence of myocyte apoptosis in the heart
and soleus muscle of animals administered equimolar
doses of  xxxd2098xxx , clenbuterol or  xxxd2398xxx . then, in a
second group of animals, implanted with telemetric blood
pressure transducers, we measured the effects on blood
pressure and heart rate of equimolar doses of  xxxd2098xxx 
and clenbuterol.
methods
animal husbandry

all experimental procedures were conducted in
accordance with the animals (scientific procedures)
act 1986 and according to uk home office guidelines.
male wistar rats (289 ± 19 g) were bred in-house in a
conventional colony, housed in controlled conditions of

exp physiol 91.6 pp 1041–1049

20◦ c, 45% relative humidity and a 12 h light (06.00–
18.00 h) and 12 h dark cycle, with water and food available
ad libitum.
beta-agonist-induced myocyte apoptosis

the dose dependency of beta-agonist-induced apoptosis
was investigated from 0.003 to 3 mmol kg−1 . independent
groups of rats (n = 6 in each group) were given single
subcutaneous injections of either beta-agonist ( xxxd2098xxx ,
clenbuterol or  xxxd2398xxx ) or saline vehicle and were
killed 4 h later. to investigate the beta-ar subtype mediating
myocyte apoptosis, animals (n = 6–8 in each group) were
given single subcutaneous injections of either 10 mg kg−1
bisoprolol (beta 1 -ar selective antagonist) or 10 mg kg−1
ici 118 551 (beta 2 -ar selective antagonist) 1 h before
injection of the most damaging dose (3 mmol kg−1 ) of
beta-agonist. previous experiments using this model (tan
et al. 2003; burniston et al. 2005e) have shown that
such administrations provide selective beta 1 - or beta 2 -ar
antagonism, respectively.
at the end of each experiment, the rats were concussed
and killed by cervical dislocation, and their heart and
soleus muscles isolated. the heart was mounted apex
uppermost on a cork disc, and a segment of the midbelly of each soleus was mounted in transverse section.
muscles were snap-frozen in super-cooled isopentane and
stored at −80◦ c, prior to cryo-sectioning (5 mum thick).
apoptosis was detected on cryosections in vitro using
an anti- xxxg341xxx  antibody (r&d systems, minneapolis,
mn, usa) as previously described (goldspink et al. 2004;
burniston et al. 2005c,d,e, 2006). our previous work
(goldspink et al. 2004) and that of others (de angelis
et al. 2002) has shown that  xxxg341xxx  activity colocalizes
with dutp nick-end labelling on cryosections in vitro, and
with  xxxg166xxx –biotin detection of phosphatidylserine
externalization in vivo (burniston et al. 2005e), validating
this method of detecting apoptosis.
the incidence of beta-agonist-induced myocyte death
in the heart and soleus muscles was quantified from
cryosections stained with  xxxg341xxx . cardiomyocyte death
was measured in the left ventricular subendocardium.
for each heart, six to eight fields of view (×100
magnification), encompassing the entire subendocardial
region (approximately 104 cells), were digitized. positive
staining (apoptosis) was differentiated from the
haematoxylin background, and the incidence of myocyte
death expressed as percentage area relative to each field
of view. to quantify myocyte death in the soleus, three
random fields of view (×100 magnification) across each
transverse section were digitized. both injured and viable
fibres were counted (> 700 fibres), and the number of
damaged fibres expressed as a percentage of the total.
the haemodynamic effects of beta-agonist ( xxxd2098xxx  or
clenbuterol) administration were investigated in a separate

relative myotoxicity of beta-agonists

group of animals surgically implanted with telemetric
blood pressure transducers.
surgical procedures

prophylactic antibiotic (2 mg kg−1 baytril, enrofloxacin,
bayer healthcare, monheim, germany) was administered
2 h prior to surgery. anaesthesia was induced in a chamber
using 4% isoflurane in medical oxygen, and the animals
were intubated (18 gauge catheter) and mechanically
ventilated (∼60 breaths min−1 , 300 ms inspiration time)
with 1.5% isoflurane. the animal’s heart rate and arterial
o2 saturation were monitored via pulse oximetry and
their body temperature was monitored via a rectal probe
and maintained using a heated mat. the abdomen was
prepared, a laparotomy performed and the intestine parted
and held in place with a retractor and surgical gauze.
a section of the aorta (∼10 mm length) was isolated
immediately distal to the renal bifurcation, and two
lengths of suture passed underneath to allow proximal
and distal occlusion. the catheter probe of the telemetric
blood pressure transducer (ta11 pa-c40; data sciences
international, st paul, mn, usa) was introduced cranial
to the distal occlusion and advanced proximally into
the vessel. a small amount of tissue adhesive and a
cellulose patch were used to cover the site of the catheter
insertion, and the patency of the vessel and performance
of the transducer verified using the telemetric receiver.
the transducer body was placed in the abdominal cavity,
and the incision closed in two layers, incorporating the
suture rib of the transducer in the muscular wall of the
abdomen. anaesthesia was withdrawn, and each animal
received fluid therapy (1.5 ml sterile saline i.p.) and was
allowed immediate access to food and water. analgesia
(0.05 mg kg−1 buprenorphine, alstoe animal health, york,
uk) was given (i.m.) peri-operatively and at 12 h intervals
for 48 h postoperatively.
measurement of blood pressure and heart rate

the output from the animal’s blood pressure transducer
was monitored via radiotelemetry by placing the receiver
underneath the animal’s cage. throughout data collection,
the animals were conscious and able to move freely around
their cage. the blood pressure waveform, displayed in
real time, was analysed using acqknowledge software
(biopac systems inc., goleta, ca, usa) to give systolic
and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate. seven days
after implanting the transducer, the animal’s heart rate
and blood pressure responses to different doses (0.003–
3 mmol kg−1 ) of beta-agonist or saline were measured using a
randomized cross-over design. animals (n = 4) were given
a bolus injection (i.p.) of either clenbuterol or  xxxd2098xxx ,
and their blood pressure and heart rate responses recorded
for 24 h; a 2 day wash out period was allowed before the

next administration. the muscles of these animals were
not harvested. at the end of each experiment, the rats
were concussed and killed by cervical dislocation, and their
heart and soleus muscles isolated.
statistical analyses

data were analysed by two-way analysis of variance,
employing either an unrelated factorial design to
investigate differences in the incidence of myocyte
apoptosis or a repeated measures design to investigate
differences in the magnitude of the haemodynamic
response. in all cases, differences were considered
statistically significant if p < 0.05.

results
injection of each beta-agonist induced myocyte apoptosis in
the heart (fig. 1a) and soleus muscle (fig. 1b). in contrast,
no apoptosis was detected in the striated muscles (fig. 1c
and d) of control animals. in the heart, a significant
incidence of apoptosis was measured after injection of
0.3 mmol kg−1 of either  xxxd2098xxx  or  xxxd2398xxx  but
not clenbuterol (fig. 2a). at 3 mmol kg−1 , each agonist
induced significant (p < 0.05) cardiomyocyte death, but
clenbuterol (0.34 ± 0.07%) induced less than  xxxd2098xxx 
(1.1 ± 0.09%) or  xxxd2398xxx  (0.9 ± 0.08%). in the
soleus,  xxxd2098xxx  and clenbuterol induced significant
(p < 0.05) myofibre apoptosis at doses of 0.03 mmol kg−1
or greater, whereas only 3 mmol kg−1 of  xxxd2398xxx 
induced significant (p < 0.05) myofibre death (fig. 2b).
thus, the relative myotoxicity of  xxxd2098xxx , clenbuterol
and  xxxd2398xxx  was different in the heart (fig. 2c) and
skeletal muscle (fig. 2d).
prior beta 1 -ar selective antagonism (bisoprolol)
significantly protected the myocardium from apoptosis
induced by  xxxd2098xxx , clenbuterol and  xxxd2398xxx 
(fig. 3a). however, clenbuterol-induced apoptosis
could also be prevented by beta 2 -ar selective antagonism
(ici 118 551). in skeletal muscle, the beta-ar mediating
apoptosis was the same for all three beta-agonists, in that
only beta 2 -ar blockade was effective (fig. 3b).
radiotelemetric recording of aortic blood pressure
in conscious unrestrained animals revealed marked
differences in the haemodynamic effects of  xxxd2098xxx 
and clenbuterol (fig. 4). in response to injection of
3 mmol kg−1 of beta-agonist, the greatest change in
heart rate was measured after 2 min and the greatest
change in blood pressure after 10 min (fig. 5), and
these time points were used to collect dose–response
data shown in fig. 6. the half-life of the beta-agonistinduced haemodynamic response after administration
of this dose was approximately 6 and 16 h for
 xxxd2098xxx  and clenbuterol, respectively. administration

of 0.003 mmol kg−1  xxxd2098xxx  significantly (p < 0.05)
elevated heart rate, whereas heart rate was only
significantly (p < 0.05) increased after 0.03 mmol kg−1
clenbuterol. at doses of 0.003 and 0.03 mmol kg−1 , the
positive chronotropic effect of  xxxd2098xxx  was significantly
(p < 0.05) greater than that of clenbuterol (fig. 6a). all
doses of clenbuterol significantly (p < 0.05) depressed
diastolic blood pressure, and this hypotensive effect was
significantly (p < 0.05) greater than that of  xxxd2098xxx  at
doses of 0.003 and 0.03 mmol kg−1 (fig. 6b). systolic
blood pressure significantly (p < 0.05) decreased after
administration of 0.003 mmol kg−1 clenbuterol, and
administration of larger doses (0.3 and 3 mmol kg−1 ) of
either  xxxd2098xxx  or clenbuterol significantly (p < 0.05)
decreased systolic blood pressure (fig. 6c).
discussion
the present work reveals that the cardiotoxicity of
 xxxd2098xxx  is equivalent to that of the widely recognized
cardiotoxic agent,  xxxd2398xxx , and much greater than that
of clenbuterol (fig. 2).  xxxd2098xxx  is a potent stimulator of
the beta 2 -ar (january et al. 1997), but our beta-blockade studies
(fig. 3) suggest that the greater cardiotoxicity of  xxxd2098xxx 
over clenbuterol results from its stimulation of the beta 1 -ar
(similar to  xxxd2398xxx ), rather than its greater potency at
the beta 2 -ar or its selectivity for the beta 2 -ar  xxxg2224xxx  s signalling
pathway (xiao et al. 2003). these findings are in agreement
with previous studies in vitro (hoffmann et al. 2004) and
clinical data (burgess et al. 1991) that have each suggested
that  xxxd2098xxx  stimulates both beta 1 - and beta 2 -ar. in light of

exp physiol 91.6 pp 1041–1049

this evidence, we should reappraise our classification of
 xxxd2098xxx  as a selective beta 2 -ar agonist. indeed, fenoterolinduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (fig. 1) may underlie the
previously observed myocardial scaring after intravenous
infusion of this agent (pack et al. 1994), and it could be
speculated that the similar cardiotoxicity of  xxxd2398xxx 
and  xxxd2098xxx  might also link their respective associations
with the asthma mortalities of the 1960s and 1980s (sears
& taylor, 1994; beasley et al. 1999).
in agreement with the myotoxicity data, the poorer
selectivity of  xxxd2098xxx  for the beta 2 -ar was also evident
in its effects on heart rate and blood pressure (fig. 6).
 xxxd2098xxx  had a greater positive chronotropic effect than
clenbuterol, but our data do not provide evidence for a
causal link between raised heart rate and myocyte death.
studies conducted in vitro (communal & colucci, 2005)
and our previous work in vivo (burniston et al. 2005b,e)
have each demonstrated that the myotoxic effects of
beta-agonists are mediated by overstimulation of the
beta 1 -ar and its downstream signalling cascade. the
haemodynamic changes caused by clenbuterol (fig. 6)
agree well with previous data from anaesthetized rats
(jones et al. 2004) and, as opposed to  xxxd2098xxx , conform
to the expected paradigm for a beta 2 -ar selective agonist.
jones et al. (2004) also investigated the beta 2 -agonist prodrug brl-47672, reporting that it had a lesser effect on
heart rate and mean arterial pressure than clenbuterol.
muscle anabolism induced by brl-47672 (jones et al.
2004) may be similar to that induced by clenbuterol (rajab
et al. 2000) and therefore brl-47672 may represent a more
acceptable means of inducing muscle growth. however,

relative myotoxicity of beta-agonists

caution should still be advocated because brl-47672 is
metabolized to a beta 2 -ar agonist (sillence et al. 1995), and
the potential myotoxicity of this metabolite is unknown.
in support of previous work from our laboratory
(burniston et al. 2002, 2005a,e; ng et al. 2002; tan et al.
2003; goldspink et al. 2004), skeletal myofibre death
was mediated only via the beta 2 -ar, irrespective of the
agonist administered (fig. 3b). when the hearts from these
animals were investigated, however, the effect of beta 1 - or
beta 2 -ar selective antagonism was different depending on
which agonist was used (fig. 3a). clenbuterol-induced
cardiomyocyte apoptosis could be prevented by either

beta 1 -ar or beta 2 -ar blockade, whereas only beta 1 -ar selective
blockade prevented  xxxd2098xxx - or  xxxd2398xxx -induced
cardiomyocyte death. previously, we have shown that
clenbuterol induces cardiomyocyte death in vivo by
modulating the sympathetic nervous system (burniston
et al. 2002, 2005e). because of this, the cardiotoxicity of
beta 2 -ar selective agonists, such as clenbuterol (fig. 2a) or
salbutamol (pack et al. 1994), is less than that of agonists,
such as  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd2398xxx , that also stimulate
the cardiomyocyte beta 1 -ar and, thereby, directly induce
cardiomyocyte death. the cardiotoxicity of  xxxd2398xxx 
and  xxxd2098xxx  was decreased, rather than increased, after

beta 2 -ar antagonism (fig. 3a). this effect, which is contrary
to expectations from studies in vitro showing an antiapoptotic effect of beta 2 -ar agonism, exemplifies the need
to conduct studies, such as the present work, that replicate
the intended use of these agents in vivo.
owing to differences in body size and
pharmacobiodynamics, it is not possible to extrapolate
doses used here for rats to likely doses in humans. however,
our haemodynamic data can be used to identify doses that
induced changes within the animals’ physiological range.
administration of either  xxxd2098xxx  or clenbuterol at doses
of 0.3 mmol kg−1 or greater induced maximal increases
in heart rate (563.5 ± 8.6 beats min−1 ; fig. 6a), which
represent the upper limit of the animals’ physiological
range. at the lesser dose of 0.03 mmol kg−1 ,  xxxd2098xxx 
increased the animals’ heart rate to 78% and clenbuterol
to 42% of their heart rate reserve (maximum heart rate
minus resting heart rate). at this dose,  xxxd2098xxx  and
clenbuterol each induced significant myocyte apoptosis
in the soleus muscle (fig. 2b), while the incidence of
apoptosis in the heart failed to reach statistical significance
(fig. 2a). these findings show the potential of these
agents to induce myocyte death at ‘physiological’ doses
and are especially worrisome with regard the illicit use of
these agents. the pseudoscience associated with the abuse
of beta 2 -agonists for promoting muscle growth suggests
that the user increase the dose until the side-effects,
which include muscle tremors and elevated heart rate,
can no longer be tolerated (duchanie, 1992). this form
of prescription could be responsible for the reported
cases of myocardial infarction in body builders abusing
clenbuterol (goldstein et al. 1998; kierzkowska et al.
2005). whether endogenous catecholamine release could
also cause myocyte death at levels eliciting submaximal
changes in heart rate cannot be extrapolated from
these findings using synthetic agents but is worthy of
investigation.

explained by the desensitization of the beta 1 -ar signalling
pathway that is associated with this model of cardiac
damage (anthonio et al. 2000). in agreement with this,
each of these studies (ahmet et al. 2004; xydas et al.
2006) reported that the antiapoptotic effect of beta 1 -ar
antagonism was less than that of beta 2 -agonism and that
there was no synergistic effect when the two interventions
(beta 1 -ar antagonism and beta 2 -agonism) were combined.
similarly, the finding that clenbuterol administration
is therapeutic and augments recovery of the unloaded
myocardium (yacoub, 2001; hon & yacoub, 2003) can
be reconciled with the present findings by appreciating
that these patients also receive ‘combination therapy’
that includes beta 1 -ar blockade. however, it is important
to note that these protective mechanisms (selective
desensitization of beta 1 -ar or co-administration of a beta 1 -ar
antagonist) are unlikely to be present in other chronic
diseases, such as cancer cachexia or sarcopenia, for
which beta 2 -ar agonist therapy is also being considered. in
each of these situations, the myotoxic effects of beta 2 -ar
stimulation on the skeletal muscle will not have been
ablated. however, we have recently discovered that the
hypertrophic effects of clenbuterol can be separated from
its myotoxic effects in the heart and skeletal muscle by
carefully controlling the dose administered (burniston
et al. 2006).
in conclusion, comparison of the dose-dependent
myotoxic and haemodynamic effects of  xxxd2098xxx  and
clenbuterol revealed that each of these agents induced
significant skeletal myocyte death and considerable
cardiomyocyte death at a dose (0.03 mmol kg−1 ) eliciting
a less than maximal change in heart rate. at this
dose,  xxxd2098xxx  induced a greater increase in heart rate,
whereas clenbuterol had a greater hypotensive effect. the
cardiotoxic effects of these agents in vivo contrast with the
effects predicted from studies in vitro and highlight the
dangers of arbitrarily translating findings in vitro to whole
animal models.
