pharmacological properties of  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists.  the availability of selective, potent, orally active and long acting nonpeptide  xxxg99xxx  type 1 (at1) receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity to obtain the benefits of selectively blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system at the level of the  xxxg100xxx  that mediates most, if not all, of the important actions of  xxxg99xxx , and avoid the nonspecificity of the  xxxg99xxx  converting enzyme inhibitors. losartan was the first, but by no means remained the only,  xxxg100xxx  antagonist. numerous other 'sartans' have emerged in the past several years and successfully completed clinical development. with the exception of eprosartan, all others, ie, candesartan, irbesartan,  xxxd3165xxx ,  xxxd3295xxx ,  xxxd3303xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx  and zolasartan, are based on medications of losartan's prototypical chemical structure. among the current  xxxg100xxx  antagonists, the rank order of the relative binding affinities (highest affinity = 1) is: candesartan 1,  xxxd3303xxx  10, e3174 (the active metabolite of losartan) 10,  xxxd3295xxx  20, losartan 50, eprosartan 100 and the prodrug  xxxd417xxx  280. the mode of (functional)  xxxg100xxx  antagonism has been characterized as surmountable/noncompetitive (losartan,  xxxd3295xxx , eprosartan) or insurmountable/noncompetitive (candesartan,  xxxd3165xxx , zolasartan, irbesartan,  xxxd3487xxx ,  xxxd3303xxx , e3174). it is very likely that slow dissociation kinetics from the  xxxg100xxx  underlie insurmountable antagonism. however, competitive or noncompetitive antagonism does not determine the antihypertensive efficacy, but the slow off-rate may extend the occupancy of the  xxxg100xxx  and thereby lengthen the duration of the antihypertensive effect.
