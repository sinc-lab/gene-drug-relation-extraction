abstract
the affinity of  xxxd1976xxx  žž r .-3-ž1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl.-5-w2-žphenylsulphonyl.ethylx-1 h-indole. for a range of 5-ht receptors was compared to values obtained for other 5-ht1br1d receptor agonists known to be effective in the treatment of migraine.
 xxxd1976xxx , like sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx , naratriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  had highest affinity for the human 5-ht1b ,  xxxg1110xxx  and putative
5-ht 1f receptor. kinetic studies comparing the binding of w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan to the human recombinant 5-ht1b and
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors expressed in hela cells revealed that both radioligands bound with high specificity ž) 90%. and reached equilibrium
within 10–15 min. however, w3 hxeletriptan had over 6-fold higher affinity than w3 hxsumatriptan at the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor ž k d : 0.92 and
6.58 nm, respectively. and over 3-fold higher affinity than w3 hxsumatriptan at the  xxxg1109xxx  ž k d : 3.14 and 11.07 nm,
respectively.. association and dissociation rates for both radioligands could only be accurately determined at the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor and
then only at 48c. at this temperature, w3 hxeletriptan had a significantly ž p - 0.05. faster association rate ž k on 0.249 miny1 nmy1 . than
w3 hxsumatriptan ž k on 0.024 miny1 nmy1 . and a significantly ž p - 0.05. slower off-rate ž k off 0.027 miny1 compared to 0.037 miny1
for w3 hxsumatriptan.. these data indicate that  xxxd1976xxx  is a potent ligand at the human 5-ht1b ,  xxxg1110xxx  and 5-ht 1f receptors and are
consistent with its potent vasoconstrictor activity and use as a drug for the acute treatment of migraine headache. q 1999 elsevier science

1. introduction
 xxxd1976xxx  žž r .-3-ž1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl.-5-w2žphenylsulphonyl.ethylx-1 h-indole. has high affinity for
the human recombinant serotonin ž5-hydroxytryptamine,
5-ht. 1b and 1d receptor subtypes žgupta et al., 1996..
these receptors belong to the g-protein-coupled 5-ht1
family of 5-ht receptors which also includes the 5-ht1a
and putative 5-ht 1e 1 and 5-ht 1f receptor subtypes žhoyer
and martin, 1997.. evidence suggests that activation of
5-ht1br1d receptors, by selective agonists, such as  xxxd1976xxx , may provide effective treatment for migraine žsaxena

lower case letters ži.e., 5-ht 1e . are used in accordance with nciuphar recommendations for nomenclature of receptors žmartin,
1998..

and ferrari, 1996; meng, 1997.. indeed,  xxxd1976xxx  has
been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of
migraine žjackson et al., 1996.. although the precise site
of action of the 5-ht1br1d agonists is not entirely clear,
the effectiveness of these agents in migraine is generally
attributed to two mechanisms: constriction of the cerebral
vasculature via post-synaptic 5-ht1b receptors žhumphrey
and feniuk, 1991. and blockade of dural inflammation by
modulation of trigeminal afferents via pre-synaptic 5ht1br1d receptors žmoskowitz, 1992.. these mechanisms
are supported by the observation that the mrna coding
for the  xxxg1109xxx  is the more abundant than that for
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor in human blood vessels, including cerebral vasculature while mrna for  xxxg1110xxx  appears to be
expressed in neural tissues žhamel et al., 1993; ullmer et
al., 1995; bouchelet et al., 1996.. furthermore, 5-ht1b
receptor protein, but not  xxxg1110xxx  receptor protein, was
expressed on smooth muscle cells in human meningeal

blood vessels, while only  xxxg1110xxx  receptor protein was
expressed on trigeminal sensory neurones žlongmore et
al., 1997.. studies have also shown mrna coding for the
5-ht 1f receptor is expressed in human trigeminal ganglia
and cerebral blood vessels žbouchelet et al., 1996. and that
selective 5-ht 1f agonists, such as ly 344864 and ly
334370 are effective in the animal models of neurogenic
dural inflammation žphebus et al., 1996, 1997. implying
that affinity at 5-ht 1f receptors may contribute to an  xxxd2022xxx  action.
the expression of genes coding 5-ht receptors in
separate cell lines provides the opportunity to characterise
the binding properties and assess the selectivity of novel
5-ht1br1d agonists. in this study the binding profile of
 xxxd1976xxx  at a range of recombinant 5-ht receptors was
compared to the binding profile of sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx , naratriptan and  xxxd3135xxx . in addition, we compared
the receptor binding kinetics of w3 hxeletriptan with
w3 hxsumatriptan at the human 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors stably expressed in hela cells. in particular, the
affinity ž k d . of w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan at these
receptors was determined and rates of association and
dissociation were measured.

y808c until used.
membrane homogenates of chinese hamster ovary
žcho. cells expressing the human putative 5-ht 6 and
5-ht7 receptors were purchased from receptor biology
žbaltimore, usa. and biosignal žmontreal, canada., respectively. membrane homogenates of cho cells expressing human 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c receptors were obtained
from euroscreen žbrussels, belgium.. membrane homogenates of guinea pig brain striatum for  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
binding were prepared as previously described žgrossman
et al., 1993..
thawed cell pellets and membranes were resuspended
in cold binding buffer ž50 mm tris–hcl, 4 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 10

using a polytron homogeniser žmaximum speed for 2 min.
and were washed three times by centrifugation at 38,000 =

was resuspended and incubated for 10 min at 378c žto
metabolise endogenous 5-ht.. final pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer, aliquoted and stored at y808c
until use. the protein concentration of the resuspended
membranes was determined using a coomassie blue-based

2.2. [3h] xxxd1976xxx  and [3h]sumatriptan binding.

2.1. cell culture and membrane preparations
separate plasmids containing the human putative 5-ht 1e ,
5-ht 1f or 5-ht 5a receptor gene were transiently transfected,
using a lipofectamine kit žlife sciences, paisley, scotland.,
in either cos-7 cells ž1e, 5a. or human embryonic kidney žhek.-293 cells ž1f. which were then grown to
confluency in dulbecco’s minimum essential medium
ždmem. supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum žfcs.,
2 mm l-glutamine and 0.8 mgrml  xxxd2191xxx . hela cells
stably transfected with either the human  xxxg1110xxx  or 5-ht1b
receptor gene žobtained from dr. m. hamblin, seattle
veterans affairs medical centre, usa. were grown to
confluency in minimum essential medium žearle’s salts.
supplemented with 10% fcs, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1%
non-essential amino acids and  xxxd2191xxx  ž0.48 mgrml 5ht1b and 0.8 mgrml  xxxg1110xxx  .. hela cells stably transfected with the human  xxxg1108xxx  gene žobtained
from dr. mark caron, nc, usa. were grown to confluency in dmem supplemented with 10% fcs and 2 mm
l-glutamine and 0.8 mgrml  xxxd2191xxx . ne-115 cells which
express the mouse  xxxg1116xxx  žobtained from the
atcc, usa. were grown to confluency in dmem supplemented with 10% fcs and 2 mm l-glutamine. cells
were grown in an humidified incubator at 378c in 5% co 2
and washed twice in phosphate buffered saline žpbs. prior
to harvesting by scraping. scraped cells were resuspended

binding studies were performed in a total assay volume
of 500 ml containing final protein concentrations of 50–150
mgrml. time to equilibrium was determined by incubating 50 ml of either w3 hxeletriptan ž85 cirmmol, amersham international, buckinghamshire, uk. or w3 hxsumatriptan ž75–81 cirmmol, amersham. with 400 ml of
either 5-ht1b or  xxxg1110xxx  membrane homogenate for time
points ranging from 1 to 60 min. these experiments were
performed at either 48c or 228c using a k d , or lower,
concentration of the appropriate radioligand, as determined
from saturation assays. total and non-specific binding
were determined in duplicate at each time point. nonspecific binding was defined by 10 mm 5-ht. following
an initial incubation period of 30 min at either 48c or
228c, dissociation was initiated by addition of 10 mm
5-ht, an excess concentration which over time would
effectively displace all radioligand from the receptors.
total and non-specific binding were determined in duplicate at time points ranging from 1–90 min. saturation
analysis was performed over the concentration range: 0.1–
50 nm for w3 hxeletriptan and 1–80 nm ž5-ht1d . or 1–100
nm ž5-ht1b . for w3 hxsumatriptan with total and nsb
determined in duplicate at each radioligand concentration.
competition assays were performed with either 0.5–1
nm w3 hxeletriptan or 2–5 nm w3 hxsumatriptan using 12
half-log concentrations of test compound and were carried
out for 30 min at 228c. incubations were started by the
addition of receptor membranes and were terminated by

rapid filtration using a brandel cell harvester through
wallac or whatman gfrb filters pre-soaked in 0.5%
polyethylenimine. filters were washed 3 times with icecold tris–hcl ž50 mm ph 7.5.. each filter was dried and
receptor bound radioligand was quantified by liquid scintillation counting either on wallac 1404 ls counters or by
using meltilexe-coated filters on wallac 1204 beta counters.
2.3. 5-ht receptor binding profile
experiments to determine the affinity of  xxxd1976xxx ,
sumatriptan, naratriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and  xxxd3135xxx  at
several 5-ht receptors were carried out using the same
filtration method as described above using the conditions
shown in table 1.
2.4. data analysis
binding data from saturation experiments were analysed
by non-linear regression using the program prisme
žgraphpad software, san diego, ca, usa.. the equilibrium dissociation constant ž k d . and the maximal number
of binding sites ž bmax . for each radioligand were derived
from the langmuir equation rl s r t lrž k d q l. where
l is the concentration of free ligand concentration, rl is
the concentration of receptor-bound ligand at equilibrium
and r t is the total receptor concentration.
ic 50 žthe concentration producing 50% inhibition of
specific binding. and hill coefficients were derived from
12 point curves using an in-house data fitting programme,
where each inhibitor was tested in at least three individual
experiments. apparent k i values were derived using the
equation of cheng and prusoff ž1973.: k i s ic 50rž1 q

lrk d ., where l is the concentration of radioligand. the
association rate constant ž k on in units of miny1 nmy1 .
was derived by the pseudo first-order method žweiland
and molinoff, 1981. which takes into account the concentration žnm. of radioligand used. this method also accounts for the observed association rate ž k obs in units of
miny1 . and the dissociation rate constant ž k off in units of
miny1 . which were both derived directly from the association and dissociation curves, i.e., k on s ž k obs y k off .rl.
the dissociation half-life žt0.5 . was derived directly from
the first-order dissociation curve generated using prism.
kinetic parameters were compared using a two sample,
unpaired t-test žmicrosoft excel, version 7.0a..
2.5. drugs
w3 hx5-ht ž100–130 cirmmol. and w3 hx8-hydroxy2-ždi-n-propylamino.tetralin žw3 hx8-oh-dpat; 132 cir
mmol.were purchased from amersham international.
 xxxd1976xxx  hemisulphate,  xxxd3263xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  maleate, naratriptan hydrochloride žhcl. and  xxxd3135xxx  hemisulphate were synthesised at pfizer central research žsandwich, u.k.. 5-ht ž5-hydroxytryptamine hcl.
and dihydroergotamine tartrate were purchased from sigma
žpoole, uk..  xxxd2419xxx ,  xxxd2621xxx  maleate,
metergoline, methiothepin mesylate, yohimbine hcl and
8-oh-dpat hydrobromide were purchased from research
biochemicals international žnatick, ma, usa.. all compounds were dissolved in 0.2 ml  xxxd1896xxx 
ždmso. and made to 1 mm stock solutions with distilled
water, except for  xxxd2419xxx  which was dissolved in 50%
dmsorwater and metergoline which was dissolved in
100% dmso. all subsequent dilutions were made in
distilled water.

human  xxxg1110xxx  receptor displayed a statistically significant
ž p - 0.05. faster on-rate constant than w3 hxsumatriptan,
with k on values ž95% ci. of 0.249 ž0.132–0.47. miny1
nmy1 and 0.024 ž0.012–0.05. miny1 nmy1, respectively.
in addition, w3 hxeletriptan displayed a statistically significant ž p - 0.05. slower off-rate constant than w3 hxsumatriptan with k off values ž95% ci. of 0.027 ž0.023–0.031.
miny1 and 0.037 ž0.029–0.046. miny1 , respectively.
w3 hxeletriptan also displayed a statistically significant ž p
- 0.05. slower dissociation half-life compared to
w3 hxsumatriptan with t0.5 values ž95% ci. of 26.02 ž22.2–
30.49. and 18.82 ž15.0–23.62. min, respectively. in contrast to the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor, reliable estimates of the
kinetic parameters for w3 hxeletriptan binding to the 5-ht1b
receptor could not be obtained as the data for both association and dissociation was not adequately described by
either a one- or two-site model.

3.1. 5-ht receptor binding profile of  xxxd1976xxx 
the binding affinities žp k i . of  xxxd1976xxx , sumatriptan,
 xxxd3562xxx , naratriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  are shown in table
2. overall the binding profiles were qualitatively similar,
although there were differences in absolute selectivity.
 xxxd1976xxx , like the other 5-ht1br1d agonists tested, consistently exhibited three principle affinities for the 5-ht1b ,
 xxxg1110xxx  and 5-ht 1f receptors and had similar low affinity
for 5-ht2a , 5-ht2c , 5-ht3 ,  xxxg1117xxx  žp k i - 5.5, not shown
in table 2. 5-ht 5a and 5-ht 6 receptors. a comparison of
the selectivity ratios indicates that none of the compounds
has selectivity for the 5-ht1b over the 5-ht 1f receptor,
while 5-ht1b versus  xxxg1108xxx  selectivity varied
from only 3-fold žrizatriptan. and 4.5-fold želetriptan. to
over 10-fold žzomitriptan, naratriptan and sumatriptan..

3.3. saturation experiments
3.2. kinetics of [3h] xxxd1976xxx  and [3h]sumatriptan binding

in some of the saturation experiments, there was evidence for two binding sites with w3 hxeletriptan binding to
the 5-ht1b cell line with a high affinity component,
k d s 0.6–1.22 nm and a low affinity component, k d s
16–70 nm ždata from three experiments.. in contrast, both
w3 hx5-ht and w3 hxsumatriptan labelled only a single site in
this cell line. it is unlikely that this represents binding to
an endogenous 5-ht receptor as there was no binding of
w3 hx5-ht, w3 hxeletriptan or w3 hxsumatriptan to untransfected hela cells ždata not shown.. as the concentration
of w3 hxeletriptan used in competition and kinetic experiments was - 3 nm it was assumed that negligible binding
to the low affinity site would occur and that data generated
in these experiments represented binding to the high affinity site. when the saturation binding data for the 5-ht1b
was fitted to a single site w3 hxeletriptan bound with a k d
of 3.14 nm compared to w3 hxsumatriptan which had a k d
of 11.07 nm žtable 3, fig. 2.. at the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor
w3 hxeletriptan labelled a single site which had a k d of
0.92 nm compared to w3 hxsumatriptan which had a k d of
6.58 nm. at these concentrations specific binding typically
represented 90% to 95% of total binding for both radioli-

specific binding of w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan
to the human  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1109xxx  subtypes was
time dependent with equilibrium established rapidly, typically within 10–15 min at 228c ždata not shown.. specific
binding remained stable for up to 60 min žlongest time
point tested.. all subsequent saturation and competition
assays used a 30 min incubation time. dissociation of
w3 hxeletriptan from the human  xxxg1110xxx  receptor at 228c
was rapid ždata not shown. with over 50% of specific
binding having dissociated within the first minute and
complete dissociation achieved within 15–20 min after
addition of a saturating concentration of 5-ht ž10 mm..
as the association and dissociation rates of both radioligands at 228c was too rapid to determine accurately, and
given that rate constants of ligand–receptor interactions
are generally highly temperature sensitive žweiland and
molinoff, 1981., experiments to determine kinetic parameters were repeated at 48c in order to slow the approach to
equilibrium and the dissociation rate žfig. 1.. under these

gands at either receptor subtype. as table 3 shows, estimations of receptor densities ž bmax . were similar regardless of the radioligand used suggesting that the same
population of receptors was being labelled.
estimates of k d for w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan
binding to the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor derived from saturation
experiments were 5- and 10-fold higher than when derived
from the ratio k offrk on . this discrepancy relates to the
fact that k on and k off were derived from experiments
performed at 48 and k d was derived from experiments
performed at 228c. rate constants and equilibrium constants are known to be temperature dependent žweiland
and molinoff, 1981; treherne and young, 1988. and there-

fore in these studies it was not an unexpected finding that
the k d derived from saturation experiments differed from
the ratio k offrk on .

the compounds had not reached equilibrium žmotulsky and
mahan, 1983..
 xxxd2419xxx  and methiothepin competition curves consistently displayed low hill slopes which could be resolved
into a high affinity and a low affinity component against
both w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan binding to the
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor žtable 5.. in addition, methiothepin competition curves with both w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan binding to the  xxxg1109xxx  were also biphasic,
although the separation between the affinities of these
components was smaller than that observed at the  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor žtable 5.. it was not possible to determine if
 xxxd2419xxx  competition curves were also biphasic at the
 xxxg1109xxx  as the binding of w3 hxeletriptan and
w3 hxsumatriptan were not completely inhibited by  xxxd2419xxx , even at the highest concentration tested ž10 mm..

4. discussion
this study has demonstrated that the 5-ht receptor
binding profile of  xxxd1976xxx  is qualitatively similar to the
binding profile of sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx , naratriptan
and  xxxd3135xxx . as expected these compounds demonstrated high affinity for the human 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors which is consistent with their known vasoconstrictor properties in isolated vascular tissues žferro et al.,
1995; connor et al., 1997; martin, 1997; gupta et al.,
1999., effects which are generally accepted to be mediated
through smooth muscle 5-ht1b receptors žhamel et al.,
1993; longmore et al., 1997; razzaque et al., 1997;
verheggen et al., 1998.. in addition to high affinity for
5-ht1br1d receptors, all of the 5-ht1br1d receptor agonists consistently had high affinity for the 5-ht 1f receptor,
indeed a comparison of potencies at the 5-ht1b versus the
5-ht 1f receptor indicated that none of the compounds were
selective, suggesting that affinity at this receptor subtype
may be important in the  xxxd2022xxx  action of these drugs.
a recent study by wainscott et al. ž1998. has shown that
for 5-ht1br1d agonists a statistically significant correla-

tion exists between the affinity and potency for the human
5-ht 1f receptor and inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated plasma protein extravasation, a model of migraine.
thus, if the 5-ht 1f receptor is implicated in inhibition of
dural plasma protein extravasation, then high affinity for
the 5-ht 1f receptor may be an advantage for  xxxd2022xxx 
drugs such as  xxxd1976xxx . as yet, the efficacy of highly
selective 5-ht 1f receptor agonists, such as ly334370, in
the treatment of migraine remains to be demonstrated.
selectivity for the  xxxg1108xxx  ranged from 3-fold
žrizatriptan. and 4.5-fold želetriptan. to over 10-fold
žzolmitriptan, naratriptan and sumatriptan.. agonist activity at the human recombinant  xxxg1108xxx  has been
observed for drugs used in migraine therapy including the
5-ht1br1d receptor agonists žnewman-tancredi et al.,
1997; dupuis et al., 1998; pauwels et al., 1998. and also
 xxxd1976xxx  žunpublished data.. however, effects in vivo
have not been consistently demonstrated, for example,
sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  elicit hypotension and bradycardia in the anaesthetised normotensive rat, an effect
attributed to activation of central 5-ht1a receptors and
reduction in sympathetic outflow, but major effects on
haemodynamics were not observed with the more brainpenetrant  xxxd3562xxx  žpaignez et al., 1998.. furthermore,
the 5-ht 1f-selective agonist ly334370 which shows
nanomolar affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx  and stimulation
of w35 sx-gtp-g-s binding in vitro, also failed to produce
any 5-ht1a activity in rats in vivo žovershiner et al.,
1996.. nevertheless, given the evidence of involvement of
5-ht1a receptors in the modulation of sleep, emesis, anxiety and depression žlucot and crampton, 1989; baldwin
and rudge, 1995; de vry, 1995; gale, 1995; wolff et al.,
1997. agonist activity at this receptor might have potential
implications in terms of the ancillary properties of drugs
used for migraine treatment.
with the exception of modest affinity for the 5-ht7 and
5-ht 1e receptors, and for which there is no evidence that
activity at these receptors contributes to the  xxxd2022xxx 
properties of 5-ht1br1d agonists,  xxxd1976xxx  showed no
significant activity at other 5-ht receptors. in addition,

266

c. napier et al.r european journal of pharmacology 368 (1999) 259–268

concentrations up to 10 mm  xxxd1976xxx  displayed little
affinity for b 1- and b 2-adrenoceptors, adenosine ža 1 .,
dopamine žd 1 and d 2 . and opioid receptors and dihydropyridine calcium channel binding sites žunpublished data..
a comparison of the affinity estimates using
w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan indicated that  xxxd1976xxx 
had a 6-fold higher affinity for the human  xxxg1110xxx  receptor
compared to sumatriptan. this is in good agreement with
the data generated using w3 hx5-ht as the ligand žtable 2.
in which  xxxd1976xxx  displayed 8-fold higher affinity. at the
human  xxxg1109xxx   xxxd1976xxx  was 5-fold more potent
than sumatriptan using w3 hxeletriptan as the ligand and
3-fold more potent when using w3 hxsumatriptan. again,
this result agrees with that generated using w3 hx5-ht in
which  xxxd1976xxx  had 4-fold higher affinity for the 5-ht1b
receptor compared to sumatriptan. the observation of two
binding sites in the  xxxg1109xxx  cell line with
w3 hxeletriptan was an unexpected finding, as we did not
observe this with either w3 hx5-ht or w3 hxsumatriptan when
tested against the same batch of cell membranes. however,
it is consistent with the report by selkirk et al. ž1998. that
w3 hx5-ht labels two binding sites in a cho cell line
expressing the human 5-ht1b , but not the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor. in addition, these workers have also shown that the
5-ht1br1d receptor antagonist w3 hxgr125743 labels both
high and low affinity states of the  xxxg1109xxx , but
predominantly the high affinity state in the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor žselkirk et al., 1997.. as this effect was only observed
at high concentrations and given that the concentration of
w3 hxeletriptan used in the competition and kinetic studies
was - 3 nm it was assumed that binding to the low
affinity site was negligible.
both w3 hxeletriptan and w3 hxsumatriptan displayed high
affinity, high selectivity, and rapid association.  xxxd1976xxx 
is more lipophilic than sumatriptan as reflected by the
log dph 7.4 žoctanol:buffer distribution coefficients at ph
7.4. for the two compounds of y1.6 and q0.5, respectively žrance et al., 1996. which would suggest that
 xxxd1976xxx  and sumatriptan may show differences in their
ability to cross biological membranes and might have been
predicted to influence the properties of these radioligands.
however, this was not apparent as both radioligands displayed high levels ž) 90%. of specific binding. a rapid
approach to equilibrium was not unexpected, as we have
observed this in the same cell lines using w3 hx5-ht ždata
not shown.. similar findings have been reported for w3 hxalnitidan žleysen et al., 1996. which, unlike  xxxd1976xxx  and
sumatriptan, is a benzopyran derivative, indicating that this
rapid kinetic profile is not restricted to agonists possessing
an indole group.
as the kinetics of w3 hxeletriptan were so rapid, it was
not possible to accurately determine onroff rates at 228c.
however, at 48c w3 hxeletriptan was found to have a faster
on-rate and a slower off-rate than w3 hxsumatriptan at the
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor žboth differences were statistically significant.. although we accept that studies in recombinant cell

lines are far removed from the clinical situation, this may
contribute to the rapid onset, longer duration of action and
lower frequency of headache recurrence that has been
reported for  xxxd1976xxx  in man žsteiner, 1998.. reliable
estimation of kinetic parameters for w3 hxeletriptan at the
 xxxg1109xxx  subtype could not be obtained as the data
for both association and dissociation was not adequately
described by either a one or two site model. this may have
been due to the low affinity component which was occasionally detected in w3 hxeletriptan saturation assays.
as expected p k i values for a range of compounds were
similar regardless of radioligand and the affinities were in
good agreement with published data žbard et al., 1996;
leysen et al., 1996; saxena and ferrari, 1996; meng,
1997; pauwels et al., 1997; wurch et al., 1997., with any
differences in absolute affinity probably reflecting the
expression of receptors in different cell lines. the biphasic
competition curves with  xxxd2419xxx  and methiothepin at the
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor and methiothepin at the  xxxg1109xxx 
were an unexpected observation, given that biphasic competition curves are more commonly observed when using
an antagonist radioligand, although similar findings have
been reported with  xxxd2419xxx  at the rat recombinant  xxxg1110xxx 
and the human recombinant  xxxg1110xxx  receptor using w3 hx5ht žbach et al., 1993; zgombick et al., 1995.. in the
present study the agonist radioligands were used a single
low concentration equal to or less than their respective k d
values such that p k i values were assumed represent binding to a high affinity agonist state. this contrasts the
situation with the saturation studies where a second low
affinity w3 hxeletriptan binding site in the  xxxg1109xxx 
cell line was detected at high concentrations. as there was
no w3 hxeletriptan or w3 hxsumatriptan binding to untransfected hela cells, the possibility of a second population of
endogenously expressed receptors can be ruled out. these
data suggest that in these cell lines both high and low
affinity states of the receptor exist for which the 5-ht1br1d
receptor agonists have equal affinity but which  xxxd2419xxx 
and methiothepin are able to discriminate.
in summary, these data indicate that  xxxd1976xxx  is a
potent and selective ligand for the 5-ht1b ,  xxxg1110xxx  and
5-ht 1f receptor subtypes. the binding characteristics of
 xxxd1976xxx  and w3 hxeletriptan described in this study are
consistent with the reported potent vasoconstrictor activity
in isolated vascular tissues žgupta et al., 1999. also with
the clinical findings that  xxxd1976xxx  is an effective treatment
for migraine in man žjackson et al., 1996..
