summary

and

conclusions

1. the kinetics of onset of cx-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic
2cid (ampa) receptor desensitization by glutamate, and the extent of attenuation of  xxxg981xxx  desensitization by  xxxd1783xxx , showed pronounced cell-to-cell variation in
cultures of rat hippticerrlpal neurons. cultures prepared from area
ca1 stratum radiatum tended to show weaker modulation
by
 xxxd1783xxx  than cultures prepared from the whole hippocampus.
2. kinetic analysis of concentration jump responses to glutamate revealed mu3’ _i-1
,,e populations of receptors with fast (x400
ms), intermediate ( ~2-4 s), and slow ( >20 s) time constants for
recovery from modulation
by  xxxd1783xxx .
the amplitudes of
these components varied widely between cells, suggesting the existence of at least three populations of  xxxg981xxx  subtypes, the
relative density of which varied from cell to cell.
3. the complex patterns of sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx 
seen
in hippocampal
neurons could be reconstituted by assembly of
recombinant  xxxg981xxx  subunits generated from cdnas encoding the flip (i) and flop (0) splice variants of the  xxxg952xxx  and
 xxxg953xxx  subunits. recovery from modulation by  xxxd1783xxx  was
slower for glur-aibi
and  xxxg952xxx ,bi
than for glur-aib,
and
 xxxg952xxx ,bo.
4. coexpression of the flip and flop splice variants of  xxxg952xxx ,
in the absence of  xxxg953xxx , revealed that heteromeric ampa receptors with intermed+:
sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx ,
similar to responses observed for the combinations  xxxg952xxx ,bi
or glur-aib,,
could be generated independently
of the presence of the  xxxg953xxx 
subunit. however, recovery from modulation by  xxxd1783xxx  was
twofold slower for g’ur-aibi than for homomeric glur-ai, indicating that the  xxxg952xxx  and  xxxg953xxx  subunits are not functionally
equivalent in controlling sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx .
5. these results demonstrate that ampa receptors expressed in
hippocampal neuron are assembled in a variety of subunit and
splice variant combinatrons that might serve as a mechanism to
fine-tune the kinetics of synaptic transmission.

introduction

the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid (ampa) -preferring glutamate receptors that mediate
fast excitatory responses at central synapses are heterooligomers generated by the regulated expression and assembly
of members of tlje  xxxg952xxx , b, c, and d, or  xxxg952xxx , 2,
3, and 4 gene family (boulter et al. 1990; hollmann and
heinemann 1994; keinanen et al. 1990; wisden and seeburg
1993 ) . the functional properties of ampa receptors are
known to vary wi& subunit composition, alternative splicing, and mrna editing of selected subunits (hollmann et

al. 1991; lomeli et al. 1994; mosbacher et al. 1994; sommer
et al. 1990; verdoorn et al. 1991) . the best-characterized
example of such regulation is a pronounced reduction of the
high ca2’ permeability characteristic of unedited ampa
receptor subunits in heterooligomers containing the edited
form of the  xxxg953xxx  subunit (burnashev et al. 1992; geiger
et al. 1995; hollmann et al. 1991; hume et al. 1991; jonas
et al. 1994; verdoorn et al. 1991) . in addition, expression
of the edited version of  xxxg953xxx  blocks  xxxd3234xxx -mediated
inward rectification in ampa receptors (bowie and mayer
1995; donevan and rogawski 1995; kamboj et al. 1995;
koh et al. 1995 ) . also affected by subunit composition are
the kinetics of deactivation (lomeli et al. 1994; mosbacher
et al. 1994), the extent and the rate of onset and recovery
from desensitization (lomeli et al. 1994; mosbacher et al.
1994; sommer et al. 1990)) and the relative affinities of
various agonists and antagonists (stein et al. 1992).
alternative splicing of two 115-base-pair exons that encode 38 amino acids located in a domain between the membrane-spanning regions m3 and m4 generates flip and flop
splice variants for each  xxxg981xxx  subunit (sommer
et al. 1990). recently proposed transmembrane topology
models place the flip/flop region in an extracellular location
adjacent to the glutamate binding site (bennett and dingledine 1995; hollmann et al. 1994; stern-bach et al. 1994).
although the physiological significance of the expression of
 xxxg981xxx  flip versus flop splice variants is not yet
fully understood, the rates of deactivation and of desensitization have been shown to vary between splice variants in a
subunit-dependent manner and are thus possible determinants of the kinetics of synaptic transmission (geiger et al.
1995; lomeli et al. 1994; mosbacher et al. 1994; partin et
al. 1994). in particular, the flop versions of  xxxg954xxx  and
 xxxg955xxx , both of which produce fast deactivation and desensitization (mosbacher et al. 1994), are present at high levels
in cells with rapid synaptic currents (geiger et al. 1995).
in contrast, high levels of expression of glur-bbip are correlated with slow deactivation and desensitization of ampa
receptor responses in membrane patches and slower synaptic
currents (geiger et al. 1995 ) .
prior work on recombinant ampa receptors generated
from the  xxxg952xxx  and  xxxg953xxx  subunits has revealed splicevariant-dependent effects of the allosteric modulator  xxxd1783xxx , with pronounced attenuation of desensitization for
flip splice variants, but relatively little effect on the extent

of equilibrium desensitization for flop splice variants (partin
et al. 1994, 1995). these experiments further revealed that
flip subunits are dominant in determining the behavior of
heteromeric ampa receptors regardless of whether present
in  xxxg952xxx  or  xxxg953xxx . the results of such experiments suggest that  xxxd1783xxx  could be used to test for native ampa
receptors that lack subunits containing the flip splice variant.
on the basis of the results of single cell pcr, which reveal
high levels of expression of flop-containing subunits in interneurons but not principal neurons of the hippocampus (bochet et al. 1994; geiger et al. 1995)) we examined the sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx  of two preparations of hippocampal
neurons, which were chosen to contain different densities of
interneurons versus principal neurons. in conjunction with
new experimental data obtained with recombinant ampa
receptors, our results suggest the expression in hippocampal
neurons of a complex mosaic of native ampa receptors
with variable splice variant stoichiometry.
methods

hippocampal

neuron cultures

primary cultures of neurons from pl hippocampus and from a
microdissection
of stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare
area
ca1 white matter from p8 hippocampus
were prepared from
sprague-dawley
rats. tissues were dissociated with the use of
papain or pronase e, and the resulting cell suspension was plated
onto a confluent hippocampal glial cell feeder layer prepared 2 wk
earlier by a similar process. details of growth conditions and media
have been given previously (mayer et al. 1989). cultures from pl
hippocampus were maintained 6- 14 days before recording. from
pyramidal-shaped
neurons, whereas stratum radiatum area ca1
tissue was maintained l-5 days in culture before recording from
neurons with multipolar morphology. whole cell recordings were
obtained with the use of an axoclamp 2-a amplifier in discontinuous voltage-clamp
mode at a switching frequency of 10 khz. microelectrodes (wpi tw150f-6)
had resistances of 3-5 mo when
filled with the following intracellular recording solution (in mm) :
125 csmeso,,
15 cscl, 5 ethylene glycol-bis (p-aminoethyl
ether)-n,n,n’,n’-tetraacetic
acid, 1 mgc12, and 0.5  xxxg2125xxx ,, ph
7.2, osmolarity 310 mosm. for outside-out patch recordings, 10
mm csmeso, was replaced by 10 mm csf and mgatp was
added at a concentration of 2 mm.
the extracellular
solution contained 160 mm nacl, 2.5 mm
kcl, 10 mm n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n’-2-ethanesulfonic
acid (hepes ) , 2 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,, 1 mm mgc12, 10 mm glucose, and
0.01 mg/ml phenol red, ph adjusted to 7.3 with naoh, osmolarity
was 325 mosm. also included in the extracellular
solution were
500 nm tetrodotoxin, 10 pm  xxxd2947xxx , 0.5 pm mk-801, and 500
pm kynurenic acid. in some whole cell experiments,
100 mm
nacl was replaced with equimolar sucrose to reduce the magnitude
of glutamate-evoked
currents and improve voltage-clamp control;
in neurons with exceptionally
large currents it was in addition
necessary to reduce the holding potential from -60 to -40 or
-30
mv.

density on either 35-mm petri dishes or coverslips coated with
fibronectin or polylysine, and transfected 24 h later with the use
of the calcium phosphate precipitation
technique of chen and
okayama ( 1987). cells were maintained in minimum essential
medium with earle’s salts, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine
serum. heteromerization
of  xxxg952xxx  with  xxxg953xxx  was assessed by
analysis of current-voltage
plots as described previously (partin et
al. 1994), and data for cells with significant inward rectification
were excluded. forty to 72 h after transfection, whole cell recordings were obtained from isolated 293 cells at a holding potential of -60 mv with the use of an axopatch-1d amplifier. extracellular recording solution contained 145 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl,
1.8 mm caci,, 1 mm mgcl*, 5 mm hepes, and 0.01 mg/ml
phenol red, ph 7.3, osmolarity 305 mosm. borosilicate glass pipettes (wpi 1b 150f) had resistances of 2-5 rn0 when filled with
the following
solution (in mm) : 135 cscl, 10 csf, 0.5 cac12, 1
mgciz , 10 hepes , and 5 cs,bis- ( o-aminophenoxy
) -n, n, n ‘, n ‘tetraacetic acid, ph 7.2, osmolarity 305 mosm.

rapid perfusion techniques
for whole cell recording, solutions were applied with the use of a
stepper motor-based fast perfusion system as described previously
(vyklicky
et al. 1990). responses were filtered at l-4 khz (8pole bessel filter), digitized as required, and stored on a macintosh
iifx computer using an itc- 16 interface under control of the data
acquisition and analysis program synapse. the control barrel of
the fast perfusion system contained normal extracellular solution
without kynurenic acid; other barrels contained the same solution
with 100-300 ,um kainate, 1 mm l-glutamate, 100 pm  xxxd1783xxx , or both 1 mm l-glutamate
and 100 ,um  xxxd1783xxx .
 xxxd1783xxx 
was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide
(dmso) at 20
mm before dilution with extracellular solution, and an equivalent
final concentration of dmso (0.5%) was added to all glutamate
and control solutions not containing  xxxd1783xxx .
in experiments performed on outside-out patches excised from
hippocampal
neurons, solutions were applied with the use of a
four-barrel piezo-based perfusion system with solution exchange
times 5200 i_ls,as described previously (patneau et al. 1993).
one pair of barrels contained normal extracellular solution without
kynurenic acid and the same solution with 1 mm l-glutamate,
respectively. the second pair of barrels contained the same solutions with l-200 pm  xxxd1783xxx 
added. patches were voltage
clamped at -60 mv with the use of an axopatch 200 amplifier.
after each experiment the patch was disrupted and open tip junction currents were recorded in order to subsequently verify appropriate solution exchange during the experiment.

data analysis
for outside-out patches, between 5 and 10 responses to loo-ms
applications of l-glutamate were averaged, and the decay of the
glutamate response was fit by one or the sum of two exponentials
over a period of 90 ms starting at 90-95% of peak. the amount
of desensitization
was calculated by (1 - amplitude at 90 ms
after peak/peak) * 100%. currents obtained in the outside-out patch
configuration
showed time-dependent
rundown that was variable
in amount in different experiments. for illustrations, current traces
were scaled according to the amplitude of the control response
recorded at the beginning of an experiment.
the decay of whole cell responses to lo- to 30-s applications
of glutamate, recorded immediately after the removal of  xxxd1783xxx , was fit from 95% of peak to baseline with the sum of three
exponentials. each of the time constants was free to vary. in experiments on cultured neurons, for which we typically applied glutamate for 10 s, more consistent fits were obtained when the slow

time constant (7,) was constrained to a fixed value of 30 s, chosen
as intermediate between the mean (36.2 s) and median (26.6 s)
of values derived from unconstrained fits. for three neurons it was
possible to apply glutamate for 30 s, but analysis of responses
to longer applications of glutamate were not practical in most
experiments because neurons were frequently damaged by the
large-amplitude
currents recorded after treatment with  xxxd1783xxx ; in experiments on recombinant ampa receptors, for which
we typically used 30-s applications of glutamate, 7, was always
estimated from unconstrained fits. in cases where the amplitude of
one component approached 0, or where the time constants of two
components were nearly equal, the decay of the glutamate response
was instead fit with the sum of two exponentials. to determine the
rectification properties of  xxxg981xxx  currents, the membrane
potential was ramped from - 105 to +65 mv at 0.113 v/s during
the application of 100 or 300 pm kainate. current-voltage relationships for kainate-evoked responses were leak subtracted and the
rectification ratio was calculated from the ratio of conductance
measurements at +30/-60

tively. although the two experiments are not directly comparable, the enveloping of our data from hippocampal neurons
by the dose-responsecurves for recombinant ampa receptors
suggests that the different sensitivities to  xxxd1783xxx  in
patches from hippocampal neurons might be due to variable
splice variant expression. according to this, the upper extremes in our data (representing low sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx ) would be expected to be derived from recordings in
patches containing a high number of receptors composedexclusively of flop subunits. the lower extremes in our data
(representing high sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx  characteristic
of flip splice variants) tended to lie outside the dose-response
envelope for homomeric  xxxg952xxx  especially at lower  xxxd1783xxx  concentrations. this might be due to a higher affinity
for  xxxd1783xxx  of heteromeric ampa receptors generated
from flip isoforms of  xxxg952xxx  and  xxxg953xxx , the major subunits
expressed in hippocampal principal neurons (geiger et al.
1995). evidence in support of this is described below.

results

 xxxd1783xxx -resistant desensitization in stratum radiatum
neurons

heterogeneity of  xxxg981xxx  responsesin
hippocampal neurons
in outside-out membrane patches obtained from neurons
in cultures of pl hippocampus, responsesto 1 mm l-glutamate ( 100 ms) showed rapid desensitization. the kinetics
of onset of desensitization varied widely in different patches;
the time constants lay between 2 and 20 ms (n = 53).
figure 1a shows a glutamate-activated current with very
fast desensitization kinetics; in the presence of 10 pm
 xxxd1783xxx  the amount of desensitization was 92.0%. figure 1b shows a glutamate responsefrom another patch with
much slower desensitization kinetics; in this caseonly 34.5%
desensitization remained in the presenceof 10 pm  xxxd1783xxx . a direct comparison of the control desensitization kinetics and the amount of desensitization of the glutamateactivated currents in individual patches at a single  xxxd1783xxx  concentration revealed a correlation of the two parameters (fig. 1c; correlation coefficients 0.83 and 0.97 for 10
and 3 pm, respectively). these results suggestthat ampa
receptors with slow desensitization kinetics exhibit greater
sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx  than receptors with fast desensitization kinetics.
with the superfusion technique for outside-out patches
used in our experiments it was not possible to test a single
patch at more than one  xxxd1783xxx  concentration, and as
a consequence of the different sensitivities to  xxxd1783xxx 
observed between patches, it was inappropriate to use mean
values to describe the dose-responserelationship. figure 1d
shows individual values for the percentage desensitization
obtained from outside-out patch recordings (n = 44) in the
presence of  xxxd1783xxx  over the concentration range of
l-200 pm. this clearly demonstrates a wide scattering of
sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx . however, the data points were
reasonably well enveloped by dose-responsecurves obtained
for potentiation of  xxxg981xxx  responsesin xenopus
oocytes expressing the flip or flop splice variants of  xxxg952xxx  (partin et al. 1994) for which the concentrations required
for half maximal potentiation were 6.9 and 56.9 pm, respec-

recent experiments that analyzed by in situ hybridization
and single cell pcr the expression of  xxxg981xxx  subunits in identified subpopulations of hippocampal neurons
(catania et al. 1995; geiger et al. 1995; racca et al. 1995)
suggestthat the variability described above in the kinetics of
onset of desensitization, and in sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx , is
likely to arise from the occurrence of multiple populations
of neurons in cultures from hippocampus with distinct patterns of expression of  xxxg981xxx  subunits. neurons
with fast desensitization to l-glutamate and low sensitivity
to  xxxd1783xxx , characteristic of ampa receptors formed
from flop subunits (geiger et al. 1995; partin et al. 1994),
would be expected to correspond to inhibitory interneurons,
whereasneurons with higher sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx  and
slower desensitization to glutamate would be expected to
correspond to principal neurons (bochet et al. 1994; geiger
et al. 1995; racca et al. 1995). in an attempt to addressthis
we prepared cultures from area ca1 stratum radiatum with
the aim of obtaining a preparation enriched in inhibitory
interneurons. to test for expression of flop subunits, we
recorded responsesto glutamate following pretreatment with
100 ,qm  xxxd1783xxx  for ~20 s. similar to the variability
observed in hippocampal neurons, the extent of desensitization of glutamate-evoked responsesrecorded in the presence
of  xxxd1783xxx  also varied widely in neurons from stratum
radiatum cultures; however, the occurrence of cyclothiazideresistant desensitization was more prominent in stratum radiatum cultures (fig. 2). responsesevoked by l-s applications of glutamate showed only 16 t 2.7% (mean ? se)
desensitization in 23 hippocampal neuronsversus 29 -+ 3.1%
in 26 stratum radiatum neurons (p < 0.01, mann-whitney
u test). for responsesthat showed persistent desensitization
in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx , the onset of desensitization
was much slower than that in control and is described by a
single exponential with an average time constant of 423 t
48 ms in hippocampal neurons (n = 12) and 415 t 57 ms
in stratum radiatum neurons (n = 15)) typical of responses
recorded in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  for recombinant

ampa receptors assembled from flop splice variant subunits
(partin et al. 1994).
 xxxg981xxx  responses of some inhibitory neurons are
characterized by high ca2’ permeability and inward rectification consistent with low levels of expression of the  xxxg953xxx  subunit (bochet et al. 1994; geiger et al. 1995; jonas et
al. 1994) ; however, hippocampal interneurons that exhibit
linear current-voltage relationships for  xxxg981xxx  responses have also been reported (mcbain and dingledine
1993; sah et al. 1990). the results of cross-labeling studies
show that the majority of hippocampal inhibitory neurons
do in fact express the  xxxg953xxx  subunit, but at lower levels
than found for principle neurons (racca et al. 1995). to
test for expression of  xxxg953xxx  in neurons from hippocampal

and stratum radiatum cultures, we measured the extent of
rectification of  xxxg981xxx  responses, calculated from
the conductance ratio at +30/ -60 mv during application of
100 or 300 pm kainate. as a measure of expression of
 xxxg981xxx  splice variants, we measured the extent of
desensitization of responses to 1 mm l-glutamate 1 s after
removal of  xxxd1783xxx  (partin et al. 1994). similar to the
heterogeneity in sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx  (figs. 1 and 2),
there was considerable variability in the extent of rectification in neurons from both preparations (fig. 3). however,
a clear correlation was found between the rate of decay of
glutamate-evoked currents following the removal of  xxxd1783xxx  and the extent of inward rectification. cells with

the strikingly different kinetics of recovery from the modulatory effects of  xxxd1783xxx  for flip versus flop splice
variants (partin et al. 1994) provides a sensitive assay that
can be used to determine whether variability in sensitivity
to  xxxd1783xxx  arises from different relative levels of expression of receptors with fast and slow dissociation of
 xxxd1783xxx . this is possible because, as shown below, the
time constants for dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx  from flip and
flop splice variants are separated nearly 50-fold. in hippocampal neurons the decay of glutamate-evoked responses
recorded after preincubation with 100 pm  xxxd1783xxx  was
complex, and in 38 of 57 neurons it was best fit by the
sum of three exponentials, clearly indicating the existence
of more than two populations of receptors; an example is
shown in fig. 4a. when the time constants from similar
experiments on 28 neurons from hippocampus and 29 neurons from stratum radiatum were binned irrespective of their
amplitude component, values for the fast time constant (r f)
and intermediate time constant (ri) fell into fairly symmetrical distributions with mean values of 434 ? 36 ms and
4.2 2 0.30 s, respectively, for hippocampal neurons and
456 t 35 ms and 2.7 t 0.27 s, respectively, for stratum
radiatum neurons (fig. 4). the values for r f are similar to
those obtained for recombinant ampa receptors assembled
from flop splice variants (see below). values for ri do not
correspond to those previously reported for homomeric recombinant ampa receptors, whereas values for rs (36.2 t
3.41 s), which were not well defined with the 10-s applications of glutamate used in the majority of experiments, resemble those obtained previously for flip splice variants
(partin et al. 1994). in the majority of cells, excitotoxicity
resulting from large-amplitude currents following treatment
with  xxxd1783xxx  made it difficult to analyze the effects of
longer applications of glutamate. although the time constants for recovery from modulation by  xxxd1783xxx  were
relatively constant between neurons, the fraction of current
described by each component varied greatly between individual neurons in both preparations. for a total of 57 neurons
examined, 41 expressed a fast component accounting for
lo-82% of decay, 5 1 expressed an intermediate component
accounting for lo-63% of decay, and 48 expressed a slow
component accounting for lo- 100% of decay. all three
components were present in 38 neurons, whereas one or
more of these components were not observed in the remaining 19 neurons.
a variety of patterns for glutamate responses recorded following removal of  xxxd1783xxx  were readily apparent for both
hippocampal neurons and stratum radiatum neurons. several
examples are illustrated in fig. 5. predominantly fast kinetics
(i.e., >50% of the decay described by r f < 1 s) was observed
in 5 of 28 hippocampal neurons and 10 of 29 stratum radiatum
neurons, consistent with the prominent expression of receptors

1995 ) . as described previously (partin et al. 1994)) the
percent desensitization for l-s responses to 1 mm l-glutamate recorded in the presence of 100 pm  xxxd1783xxx  was
similar for glur-aia, (9 -+ 2%, yl= 6), glur-aib, (16 k
5%; m. = 5), glur-aibi (8 -+ 5%; yi = 5 ) , and  xxxg952xxx ,bi
(10 rt 5%; n = 5). in contrast, cells transfected with  xxxg952xxx ,b, exhibited marked desensitization ( 87 t 4%, n = 5).
the observation that flop splice variants continue to desensitize even in the constant presence of  xxxd1783xxx , but that
the rate of onset of desensitization is markedly slowed relative to control responses, can be explained by a relatively
low affinity of flop receptors for  xxxd1783xxx . by this reasoning, the development of  xxxg981xxx  desensitization
is limited by the rate of unbinding of  xxxd1783xxx , which
varies with  xxxg981xxx  affinity for  xxxd1783xxx .

to address the effects of subunit composition on ampa
receptor affinity for  xxxd1783xxx , we evaluated the kinetics
of dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx  from recombinant ampa
receptors formed by coexpression of  xxxg952xxx  and  xxxg953xxx 
at a ratio of 1:2. cells were preequilibrated with 100 pm
 xxxd1783xxx , and then the solution was rapidly changed to
1 mm glutamate alone applied for 2 s ( xxxg952xxx ,b.) or 30
s ( aib,, a,bi, aibi). as illustrated in fig. 6, the rate of
dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx  was dependent on both subunit
and splice variant composition.  xxxd1783xxx  dissociated
rapidly in cells expressing  xxxg952xxx ,b, (r f 233 tr 12 ms,

12.1 s (42 ? 5%).
the experiments shown in fig. 6 suggest that the intermediate kinetics of dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx  arises from
heterooligomers of  xxxg952xxx  and  xxxg953xxx , which contain both
flip and flop splice variants. faster dissociation for gluraib, than for  xxxg952xxx ,bi could result from either the effects
of flip/flop stoichiometry ( 1:2 and 2: 1 for these combinations) or from differences in the affinity of  xxxd1783xxx  for
 xxxg952xxx  versus  xxxg953xxx . the experiments described below,
and summarized in table 1, show that both factors can contribute to determining the kinetics of dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx . after pretreatment with  xxxd1783xxx , comparison of

the present results show that the rate of dissociation of
 xxxd1783xxx  from recombinant ampa receptors is dependent on both subunit (homomeric  xxxg952xxx  vs. heterooligomers assembled from  xxxg952xxx  and  xxxg953xxx  ) and splice
variant (flip vs. flop). various subunit and splice variant
combinations result in the predictable expression of three
characteristic rate constants for dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx 
in the presence of glutamate from recombinant ampa receptors in 293 cells. fast dissociation (r f = 400 ms) is characteristic of pure flop splice variants, indicating that flop isoforms combine to form receptors with low affinity for
 xxxd1783xxx . a component of fast dissociation was also
observed for the combination  xxxg952xxx ,bi, but this is probably explained by a small population ( < 10%) of homomeric
receptors assembled from  xxxg952xxx ,. intermediate rates of

effects of jlip/jop

stoichiometry

if we assume a pentameric stoichiometry for ampa receptors (wenthold et al. 1992) and random assembly of
subunits, our data from recombinant ampa receptors (table
1) suggest several inferences with respect to the effects of
flip/flop stoichiometry on the affinity of  xxxg981xxx 
heterooligomers for  xxxd1783xxx . the observation that
 xxxd1783xxx  dissociates from receptors of mixed flip/flop
stoichiometry at a rate intermediate between those for homomerit flip or flop subunits suggests that the intermediateaffinity receptor includes at least one, but fewer than five,
flip subunits. that 7-i appears not to be affected by the ratio
of expression of  xxxg952xxx , to glur-ai suggests that, unless
receptor assembly is limited to exclude certain subunit combinations, affinity for  xxxd1783xxx  may not be a graded
function of the number of flip subunits in a receptor complex,
but rather that receptors of several splice variant stoichiometries behave in a similar manner; further analysis with higher
resolution will be required to address this. the prominence
of the intermediate component (ri) in  xxxg952xxx ,bi heterooligomers (46 t 6%), even with overexpression of glur-bi
(a:b ratio 1:2), and the absence of rs in glur-aib, heterooligomers ( a:b ratio 1:2), suggest that heterooligomerscontaining a single flip subunit are unlikely to have high affinity
for  xxxd1783xxx . conversely, the prominence of r, in  xxxg952xxx ,bi heterooligomers (42 t 3%, a:b ratio 1:2) demonstrates that ampa receptors with high affinity for  xxxd1783xxx  can be produced with fewer than five flip subunits.
finally, the prominence of rs in  xxxg952xxx ,ai heterooligomers
(expressed at a ratio of 4: 1) is much greater than expected
from the random assembly of subunits if four flip subunits
were required to produce receptors with high affinity for
 xxxd1783xxx , suggesting that only three flip subunits may
be required. therefore, on the basis of these observations
and the assumptions stated above, we can deduce the following: 1) that receptors composed exclusively of flop splice
variants have low affinity for  xxxd1783xxx , 2) that receptors
composed exclusively of flip splice variants have high affinity for  xxxd1783xxx , 3) that receptors assembled from the
combinations flop ‘flip4 and flop 2flip 3 are also likely to have
high affinity for  xxxd1783xxx , and 4) that receptors assembled from the combinations of flop “flip 2 and flop4flip ’ are
likely to have intermediate affinity for  xxxd1783xxx .
previous work with argiotoxin has revealed that “at least
two, but more likely more than two heteromeric receptor
complexes are assembled” on coexpression of  xxxg981xxx  subunits in oocytes as assayed on the basis of sensitivity
to block by argiotoxin (herlitze et al. 1993 ) . however, using
ca2’ permeability as an assay, the results of single-cell pcr
analyses in a number of identified neuronal populations are
consistent with only two functional  xxxg981xxx  populations with respect to ca2’ permeability, with incorporation
of a single  xxxg953xxx  subunit sufficient to produce channels

with low permeability to ca2’ (geiger et al. 1995). our
findings with respect to  xxxd1783xxx  modulation of native
ampa receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons reveal
further complexity than evident from analysis of ca2’ permeability, and suggest that there exist multiple  xxxg981xxx  populations of mixed subunit and splice variant stoichiometries.
subunit assembly and stoichiometry

ofnative

receptors

the distinct patterns of  xxxd1783xxx  dissociation kinetics
and rectification properties of native ampa receptors in
cultured hippocampal neurons provide evidence for marked
heterogeneity in subunit and splice variant composition. the
amount of heterogeneity observed in cultured neurons possibly overestimates that in vivo but is consistent with the
results of single-cell pcr analysis of  xxxg981xxx  mrna
expression in brain slice preparations (geiger et al. 1995 ) .
all possible combinations of fast, intermediate, and slow
components of dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx  observed in experiments with recombinant receptors were also observed in
hippocampal neurons, suggesting that flip and flop subunits
are normally coassembled in various proportions to give rise
to native heteromeric ampa receptors.
the interpretation of the origin of the fast dissociation
rate for  xxxd1783xxx  (r f < 500 ms) is straightforward,
because this reflects expression of only flop splice variants.
in contrast, the origins of intermediate (7-i = 2-4 s) and
slow (r, > 10 s) dissociation rates are less certain because
these could be produced by a number of potential subunit
or splice variant combinations. the receptor stoichiometries
required to produce intermediate versus slow dissociation
kinetics have yet to be definitively determined; however, it
may be significant in this regard that we only ever observed
one native  xxxg981xxx  response (1 in 56 neurons) for
which responses could be entirely described by slow dissociation, consistent with the interpretation that in  xxxg981xxx  heterooligomers a single flip subunit is not sufficient to
produce a high-affinity  xxxd1783xxx  binding site.
our observation that a few cells expressed mixed fast and
slow dissociation kinetics with no significant intermediate
component is consistent with the coexistence of mosaics of
receptors containing only flop splice variants interspersed
with receptors containing both flip and flop or only flip splice
variants. this observation suggests that subunit assembly
can be regulated to exclude formation of receptors of mixed
flip/flop composition. the most likely mechanism for this
would be temporal segregation of subunit or splice variant
mrna expression such that newly formed subunits are preferentially coassembled as neurons switch from expression
of flip to flop splice variants during development (monyer
et al. 199 1) . alternatively,  xxxg952xxx , subunits might preferentially self-assemble to exclude glur-bi, consistent with
stronger inward rectification in cells with fast dissociation
of  xxxd1783xxx .
although all of our observations can be explained by the
regulated expression and assembly of the  xxxg952xxx  and  xxxg953xxx  subunits, the principal species expressed in hippocampal
neurons (geiger et al. 1995)) it is important to consider that
 xxxg954xxx  and  xxxg955xxx  splice variants may also be expressed

in these neurons (bochet et al. 1994; boulter et al. 1990;
geiger et al. 1995; keinanen et al. 1990; monyer et al.
199 1) . preliminary experiments with brief applications of
glutamate (d. bowie and m. l. mayer, unpublished observations) revealed no obvious difference in sensitivity of  xxxg954xxx  and  xxxg955xxx  subunits to  xxxd1783xxx  from the corresponding splice variants of  xxxg952xxx . it is possible that with
the higher-resolution analysis described here small differences gould emerge, perhaps related to mrna editing of
the arg/gly site of the codon preceding the flip and flop
exons in the  xxxg953xxx ,  xxxg954xxx , and  xxxg955xxx , but not  xxxg952xxx , subunits (lomeli et al. 1994). such an effect might explain the twofold difference between the rates of dissociation
of  xxxd1783xxx  for homomeric glur-ai (arg 740) versus
glur-aibi, because the  xxxg953xxx  subunit used for our experiments (gly 764) was edited at this site. consistent with this
hypothesis, the edited (gly 764) form of  xxxg953xxx , when
coexpressed with  xxxg952xxx , shows slower desensitization than
the unedited ( arg 764) form (lomeli et al. 1994)) and thus
on the basis of data shown in fig. 1 would be expected to
show higher affinity for  xxxd1783xxx .

our analyses of  xxxg981xxx  currents in hippocampal
neurons and p8 stratum radiatum neurons suggest that under
the culture conditions employed for our experiments, both
preparations express predominantly ampa-preferring
receptors as indicated by their nondesensitizing whole cell
responses to kainate and rapidly desensitizing responses to
glutamate. a high proportion of cultured stratum radiatum
neurons exhibit marked desensitization in the presence of
cvclothiazide. similar to that seen for  xxxg981xxx  flop
isoforms expressed in 293 cells. the extent of dese&itization
for cultured stratum radiatum neurons was significantly
greater than for pyramidal-shaped neurons in hippocampal
cultures. stratum radiatum neurons also displayed a significantly larger component of ri for dissociation of  xxxd1783xxx , consistent with more frequent inclusion of flop splice
variants in receptors of mixed subunit composition. the effects of  xxxd1783xxx  on  xxxg981xxx  currents in these
populations of neurons are consistent with in situ hybridization data suggesting enhanced flop splice variant expression
in p8 stratum radiatum neurons (monyer et al. 199 1) , and
with single-cell pcr data that demonstrate high levels of
expression of flop splice variants in inhibitory interneurons
(bochet et al. 1994; geiger et al. 1995).
the apparently robust expression of flop splice variants
in pl hippocampal neurons would not be predicted from the
results of in situ hybridization with  xxxg981xxx  probes
in the intact hippocampus, raising the possibility that flop
splice variant expression develops in culture. however, the
results of our study are consistent with the heterogeneous
expression of  xxxg981xxx  subunits and splice variant
mrnas in adult hippocampal neurons (geiger et al. 1995 )
and further indicate hat naiive ampa receptors are asseml
bled from a variety of subunit and splice variant combinations. the exact composition and stoichiometry of native
ampa receptors will likely have many functional conse-

and the rate of recovery from desensitization would be expected to significantly influence the kinetics of synaptic
transmission.
