[heteologous expression of mortierella isabellina delta6 - xxxg2014xxx  gene in soybean].  gamma- xxxd2490xxx  (gla, c18:3delta(6, 9, 12) is one of nutritionally important polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  in human and animal diets. vast majority oilseeds crops do not produce gla. delta6- xxxg2014xxx  ( xxxg758xxx ) is the rate-limiting enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of linoleic acid (la) and  xxxd2490xxx  (ala) to gla and octadecatetraenoic acid (ota). in this study, a delta6- xxxg2014xxx  gene isolated from mortierella isabellina was transformed into some soybean cultivars jilin 35, jilin 47, suinong 10, suinong 14 and heinong 37 successfully by agrobacterium-mediated cotylendon node transformation system. the results of pcr analysis, southern blotting and northern blotting with transgenic plants indicated that target gene was integrated into transgenic soybean genome and expressed at the level of rna. meanwhile, total  xxxd2154xxx  were extracted from transgenic seeds and methyl-esterified. analysis of gas chromatograph (gc) showed that a novel peak corresponding to the standard of gla methyl ester was detected, the highest percentage of gamma-lenolenic acid to total  xxxd2154xxx  in transgenic seeds was 27. 067%, which indicated that mortierella isabellina delta6- xxxg2014xxx  gene was expressed in transgenic soybean. it is so far the first report on the expression of delta6- xxxg2014xxx  gene in transgenic soybean in the world.
