between

dramatically
reduced serum progesterone
and induced premature

a major concurrent

in serum cortisol, we conclude
that  xxxd3436xxx 
is an effective,
rapidly acting inhibitor
of 3/3hsd in the
macaque corpus luteum during the midluteal
phase of the menstrual

production
did not typically
resume after cessation
of  xxxd3436xxx

despite continuing

and
exposure
to  xxxd3436xxx 
was associated
with premature

or a related metabolite
may be required
to
maintain
the function

of the primate

female reproductive tract for implantation and maintenance
of pregnancy is well established(1). the biphasic pattern of
circulating progesterone levels in primates during the second
half of the normal menstrual cycle correspondsto the development, functioning, and regression of the corpus luteum

levels and the functional demise of the corpus luteum.

droplets, progesterone receptors, and progesterone production, is dependent upon the midcycle lh surge and sufficient
gonadotropin stimulation (2, 3). maintenance of luteal function is also gonadotropin dependent. a reduction in serum
lh after gnrh antagonist administration or hypothalamic
lesion results in dramatically decreasedprogesteroneproduction, whereas simultaneous replacement of gonadotropin
stimulation restores luteal progesterone release (4, 5). gonadotropin stimulation is also responsible for the maintenance of luteal function in the case of pregnancy. cg administered by injection or of placental origin stimulates continued luteal progesterone production and prevents luteal
regression,prolonging the lifespan of the corpus luteum (6).
although the ability of lh-like gonadotropins to stimulate
and maintain luteal function is well established, it is likely
that paracrine or autocrine factors modulate, or indeed mediate, gonadotropin actions in the corpus luteum. after a
thorough study of luteal function in many species,rothchild
hypothesized that progesterone itself is an important luteotropin, stimulating continued progesteroneproduction by the
corpus luteum (7). classicalprogesterone target tissues,such
as the oviduct and uterus, require progesterone receptors for
progesterone action, and both progesterone receptors and

were recently detected in the macaque(8, 9) and human (10)
corpus luteum. progesterone receptors and 3/!-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3/3hsd)were colocalized to many monkey luteal cells (8), indicating that these cells can both produce and respond to progesterone.
these observations led us to examine a possible local role
for progesterone in the regulation of the primate corpus
luteum. as an initial approach,  xxxd3436xxx , a competitive
inhibitor of 3phsd (1 l), was used to obtain acute reversible
inhibition of progesterone production during the midluteal
phase of the menstrual cycle. the effects of short term
progesterone inhibition on subsequent luteal progesterone
production and luteal structure were examined.

were detected using a monoclonal
antibody directed against the human progesterone

but revealed

similar
cytoplasmic

was observed
in luteal sections
treated with antiprogesterone

nonspecific
(8). a small number
of cells in
all luteal sections exhibited
intense cytoplasmic
staining
when treated
with antitimothy
or antireceptor
antibodies;
this staining was presumed
to reflect the endogenous
peroxidase
activity
of resident immune
cells
(8). only dark staining
directly
over cell nuclei after incubation
with
antireceptor

was considered
to be detection
of progesterone
or estrogen

quantitated
by counting

were approved
by
the orprc animal care and use committee,
and studies were conducted
in accordance
with the nih guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals.
adult females with regular
menstrual

period. one hour after  xxxd3436xxx  administration, circulating
pregnenolone was significantly elevated in treated animals
compared to controls (p < 0.01). pregnenolone levels remained high (up to 86-fold above control values) in animals
receiving  xxxd3436xxx  throughout the treatment period. after
cessation of  xxxd3436xxx 
treatment,
pregnenolone
levels
dropped, becoming indistinguishable from control levels by
day 13 of the luteal phase.
control animals exhibited a biphasic pattern of serum
progesterone levels characteristic of the normal luteal phase
(fig. 2). progesterone levels in animals before  xxxd3436xxx 
administration were similar to those in controls (fig. 2).
however, progesterone levels fell rapidly within 3 h of
 xxxd3436xxx  treatment to only 7% of the level seen in control
animals (mean + sem; p < 0.05). continued suppressionof
progesterone levels during and immediately after  xxxd3436xxx

significant.

morning (fig. 4). over the entire study period, there was no
significant difference in serum cortisol levels between control
and  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals (fig. 4). at most sampling
times during  xxxd3436xxx  treatment, serum cortisol was not
different from pretreatment levels in these samecycles; only
on the evening of the first administration of  xxxd3436xxx  were
cortisol levels significantly lower than pretreatment levels (p
< 0.01; fig. 4). however,  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals did not
demonstrate the normal diurnal pattern of serum cortisol
during the period of drug treatment as seen in control animals. after the second  xxxd3436xxx  administration, evening
cortisol levels were not significantly different from morning
levels in these sameanimals before treatment.
there was no difference in serum estradiol before the
treatment period between animals receiving vehicle or  xxxd3436xxx  (fig. 5). estradiol levels in control monkeys did not vary
significantly during and after the period of vehicle administration. within 6 h of the initial  xxxd3436xxx  administration,
however, the serum estradiol level was significantly elevated
above that in controls (p < 0.05). estradiol was higher (p <

tane-treated animals had smaller, pyknotic nuclei with irregularly shaped nuclear envelopes and uneven cytoplasm.
vacuolization of the cytoplasm, although present in some
cells from control animals, was much more prevalent after
 xxxd3436xxx  treatment. corpora lutea from  xxxd3436xxx -treated
animals also showed invasion of lymphoid cells. four days
after the initial  xxxd3436xxx  administration luteal cells displayed
characteristics similar to those of cells from corpora lutea
near the end of the luteal phase (19).

figure 7 shows frozen sections of luteal tissue from vehicle- and  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals after immunocytochemical staining for progesterone receptors. the pale cytoplasmic
staining represents nonspecific staining and is present in all
sections, including those stained with the control antibody.
all sections were counterstained to aid in identification of
nuclei, and the dark nuclear staining indicates the presence
of progesterone receptors. nuclei staining positive for progesteronereceptors were identifiable in 27 + 6% of the cells
counted in luteal tissue from control animals (fig. 7).  xxxd3436xxx  treatment beginning 4 days before lutectomy tended to
diminish the percentage of  xxxg1737xxx -positive
cells found in luteal tissue (17 + 7%), but this decline was
not significant (p = 0.1). estrogen receptors were not detected
in luteal tissue samples from either control or trilostanetreated monkeys (data not shown).
discussion

 xxxd3436xxx  dramatically increasedserum pregnenolone levelsand reduced serumprogesteronelevels in rhesusmonkeys
during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. the rise
in circulating pregnenolone preceded a significant suppression of progesteronelevels. pregnenolone levels in trilostanetreated animals rose within 1 h of initial  xxxd3436xxx  administration, whereas the progesterone concentration declined
within 3 h. these data are consistent with rapid inhibition
of 3phsd activity and prevention of new progesterone synthesis while progesterone present in serum at the time of
 xxxd3436xxx  administration was being cleared. our data indicate
that  xxxd3436xxx  acts rapidly, and this conclusion is supported
by other studies in primates.  xxxd3436xxx  effectively reduced
placental progesterone production in pregnant rhesus monkeys (20). plasma  xxxd3436xxx  levels in male and nonpregnant
female macaquespeaked 2-4 h after oral administration of
 xxxd3436xxx  (21). circulating  xxxd3436xxx  and its major bioactive
metabolite, 17-keto- xxxd3436xxx , also peaked 2-4 h after oral
administration to men (22). in this latter study (22), cortisol
levels in human male serum were inversely related to serum
 xxxd3436xxx , suggestingthat once in the serum,  xxxd3436xxx  rapidly inhibited 3/3hsd activity and adrenal steroidogenesis.
although  xxxd3436xxx  treatment led to a rapid sustained
reduction in circulating progesterone, only a transient reduction in circulating cortisol levels was observed. cortisol levels
measured in the serum of vehicle- and  xxxd3436xxx -treated
animals involved in this study were comparable to those
observed in previous studies of caged untreated macaques

normal cortisol levels indicate that appreciable adrenal
3/3hsd activity remained in  xxxd3436xxx -treated monkeys,
whereas baseline (<l.o nmol/l) serum progesterone levels
indicate functional ablation of luteal 3/3hsd activity. although transient depressionof serum cortisol similar to that
in the current study was observed after the administration
of a single dose of  xxxd3436xxx  to humans (22), maintenance of
significantly lowered serum cortisol levels required more than
a week of  xxxd3436xxx  treatment (23). the ability of acute
 xxxd3436xxx  treatment to effectively reduce ovarian, but not
adrenal, 3/3hsd activity may reflect the existence of tissuespecific 3bhsd isoforms (24,25) or different mechanismsby
which acth in the adrenal and lh in the ovary maintain
or promote 3/3hsd activity. a steroidogenic profile similar
to that seen in our  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals was observed
in women with severe, but incomplete, 3/3hsd insufficiency
(26). acute exposure to  xxxd3436xxx  provides a model that
allows dramatic reduction in ovarian progesterone production without compromising adrenal function.
unexpectedly, estradiol levels were somewhat elevated

during and immediately after  xxxd3436xxx  treatment, at a time
when circulating progesterone was markedly suppressed.
although local progesterone is a logical precursor for luteal
estradiol synthesis by the primate corpus luteum, additional
steroidogenic pathways using intra- or extraovarian precursors may contribute to estradiol production. both pregnenolone (27) and dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) (28) can be
converted to estrogens,and dhea sulfate of adrenal origin
can be converted to dhea in the corpus luteum for use in
estrogensynthesis(28). although such pathways alsorequire
a step catalyzed by sphsd, perhaps  xxxd3436xxx  more effectively inhibits the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone than of dhea to androstenedione. this possibility is
supported by evidence that androstenedione production continued during progesterone synthesis inhibition by  xxxd3436xxx 
in porcine luteal cells (29). the limited sample volume prevented serum androgen measurement in the current study.
experiments designed to specifically investigate androgen
production during  xxxd3436xxx  exposure would be required to
determine the mechanism of estradiol synthesis in these
monkeys. acute  xxxd3436xxx  treatment, leaving estradiol, lh,
and perhaps androgen levels essentially unchanged, provides

a valuable model for selective reduction of circulating progesterone. the use of additional steroidogenic enzyme inhibitors with  xxxd3436xxx  could allow simultaneous reduction of
multiple bioactive ovarian steroids.
all  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals had progesterone levels near
baseline (<l.o nmol/l) for 3 days, and low circulating progesterone levels precipitated early menses in all trilostanetreated animals compared with control animals. interestingly,
four of five treated animals did not recover progesterone
production after cessation of  xxxd3436xxx  administration. this
absence of recovery was probably not due to continued
 xxxd3436xxx  activity, as pregnenolone levels declined after the
discontinuation of  xxxd3436xxx  treatment. other studies also
show rapid clearance of  xxxd3436xxx ; 93% of  xxxd3436xxx  administered orally to rhesus monkeys was cleared from the plasma
within 48 h (21). the resumption of progesterone production
by one of five monkeys in our study also suggests that the
dose of  xxxd3436xxx  was rapidly cleared. recent studies using
macaque luteinizing granulosa cells demonstrated that although  xxxd3436xxx  rapidly reduced progesterone production
by these cells, inhibition of 3phsd activity was reversed
within 24 h after removal of  xxxd3436xxx  (30). these data
suggest that  xxxd3436xxx  does not have a direct toxic effect on
luteal cells and luteal progesterone production. the failure
of circulating progesterone to return to control levels after
the cessation of  xxxd3436xxx  treatment suggests that factors
other than residual  xxxd3436xxx  impaired 3phsd activity and,
hence, luteal function.
it is unlikely that the failure of progesterone production to
resume after  xxxd3436xxx  administration was due to a loss of
pituitary luteotropin support. circulating lh is essential for
the acute regulation of luteal progesterone production (31);
gnrh antagonist administered to decrease circulating bioactive lh dramatically reduced both circulating progesterone
and luteal 3phsd mrna (32). progesterone inhibits lh
release from the anterior pituitary, and lower circulating
progesterone levels after  xxxd3436xxx  administration would be
expected to reduce the negative feedback effects of progesterone on lh release and lead to elevated serum lh. although our multiple daily lh measurements did not detect
changes in lh bioactivity after  xxxd3436xxx  administration,
blood samples at lo-min intervals (33) would be required to
detect subtle alterations in the amplitude or frequency of lh
pulses. elevated estrogen and, perhaps, androgen levels after
 xxxd3436xxx  exposure may compensate for reduced progesterone levels and prevent an increase in lh release. studies
examining the luteolytic effects of exogenous estrogen in the
primate determined that estrogen reduces pituitary lh release; coadministration
of estrogen and gnrh maintained
the normal functional lifespan of the corpus luteum (34). in
the present study, circulating bioactive lh levels before,
during, and after  xxxd3436xxx  treatment were within the normal
range of values for animals in the midluteal phase of spontaneous menstrual cycles (31) and were not different from
those in vehicle-treated animals in this study. thus, the
failure of  xxxd3436xxx -treated animals to resume luteal progesterone production is unlikely to be due to inadequate gonadotropin support.

 xxxd3436xxx  treatment caused premature structural luteolysis
without markedly affecting progesterone and  xxxg730xxx  levels in luteal tissue. exposure to  xxxd3436xxx  during the
midluteal phase caused cytoplasmic vacuolization and nuclear degradation characteristic of corpora lutea nearing the
end of the luteal phase (19), even in the presence of continued luteotropic support. the high percentage of progesterone
receptor-positive
cells and the absence of estrogen receptorpositive cells in vehicle-treated luteal tissue did not change
with  xxxd3436xxx  treatment. in classical progesterone target
tissues, estrogen acts through estrogen receptors to stimulate
 xxxg1737xxx  expression, whereas progesterone decreases the quantity of its own receptor (35). both immunocytochemistry
(8) and radioligand binding (36) techniques
have, however, failed to detect estrogen receptors in the
macaque corpus luteum. down-regulation
of progesterone
receptors by progesterone in the absence of estrogen receptors has been reported (37), but in the monkey corpus luteum,
 xxxg1737xxx  levels peak at the midluteal phase (8),
when progesterone levels are highest. the continued presence of progesterone receptors throughout the functional
lifespan of the corpus luteum provides a mechanism by
which progesterone could alter luteal structure and function.
high intraluteal progesterone levels may be required for
the formation of the corpus luteum as well as maintenance
of luteal structure and function. previous studies in our
laboratory (13) determined that  xxxd3436xxx  treatment throughout the follicular phase in rhesus monkeys compromised
subsequent luteal progesterone production. chaffkin and
colleagues (38) demonstrated that progesterone treatment in
vitro decreased proliferation and promoted differentiation of
human luteinizing granulosa cells. the antiprogestin ru486
inhibited progesterone production and ovarian 3phsd activity in both human luteinizing granulosa cells in vitro (39)
and gonadotropin-primed
immature rats (40). cell culture
studies also suggest that progesterone increases the number
of lh receptors on bovine luteal cells during the early luteal
phase (41). taken together, these data indicate that progesterone may play an important role to induce and maintain
the differentiated state of luteal cells. the current study
provides the first in vivo evidence that progesterone may be
important, not just for development, but for the maintenance
of continued luteal progesterone production, an essential
luteal function. the presence of normal circulating lh in
 xxxd3436xxx -treated
monkeys indicates that progesterone may
mediate at least in part the chronic luteotropic action of lh
on the primate corpus luteum.
because  xxxd3436xxx  treatment raises pregnenolone, estradiol, and perhaps androgen levels, the luteolytic effects of
these steroids must be considered. regulation of neuronal
function by pregnenolone has recently been described, but a
pregnenolone receptor has not yet been characterized in any
tissue (42). estrogen receptors cannot be detected in the
corpora lutea of monkeys (8) or women (lo), and estrogen
receptor mrna was not found in monkey luteal tissue by
reverse transcriptase pcr (9). the absence of estrogen receptors and  xxxg730xxx  mrna in monkey luteal tissue
again argues against a local role for estrogen in the regulation

regulates

of primate luteolysis. however, in vitro studies have indicated
both inhibitory (43, 44) and stimulatory (45) effects of estradiol on progesterone production by primate luteal cells via
mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. in contrast, androgen receptors have been detected in primate corpora lutea
(46), so possible luteolytic effects of androgens cannot be
eliminated. a reduction in hcg-stimulated progesterone production after exposure to testosterone has been documented
in baboons (47). the ability of testosterone to reduce the
production of progesterone, androstenedione, and estradiol
by human luteal cells in vitro is consistent with the suppression of 3phsd activity (48). further studies, particularly the
ablation of luteal estrogen and androgen production and the
replacement of progestin activity, will be required to establish
an autocrine role for progesterone in the maintenance of
primate luteal function.
