[drug sensitivity of the isolated stomach and ileal preparation from a vole].  it was compared a drug sensitivity of the stomach and ileum isolated from vole with those of guinea pig, rat or mouse. histamine produced only a contraction in the vole stomach without a relaxation. since the histamine-induced contraction was inhibited by  xxxd3443xxx , the contraction seems to be mediated by histamine h1-receptor. these results in the vole, being herbivorous, was different from those of bovine stomach that the drug induced a contraction through h1-receptor and a relaxation involved to the h2-receptor. the histamine-induced contraction in the guinea pig stomach or ileum was highly sensitive, but those of rat was less. on the contrary, a serotonin-induced contraction in the rat stomach or ileum was highly sensitive, however, those of guinea pig were less. drug sensitivities of stomach and ileum from vole to histamine and serotonin were intermediate between those of guinea pig and rat.
