a b s t r a c t
despite more than a decade of research in the ﬁeld of endocrine active compounds targeting the androgen
receptor (ar), and although suitable cell lines can be obtained, no validated human stably transfected
androgen sensitive transactivation assay is available. bayer schering pharma (bsp) and the flemish institute for technological research (vito), partners within the eu-sponsored 6th framework project reprotect,
made ﬁrst steps towards such a validation. a standard operation protocol (sop) developed at bsp based
on the androgen sensitive palm cell line was transferred to vito and its performance and transferability were thoroughly studied. the investigation followed a generic protocol prepared for all reporter
gene assays evaluated within reprotect, and in both laboratories at least three independent experiments
were performed. the highest concentration to be tested was limited to 10 ␮m, if needed. a few compounds, 17␣-methyltestosterone (17␣-mt), vinclozolin and linuron, were studied using a real world
scenario, i.e., assuming that their interaction with the ar was not known: a prescreening for agonism and true, competitive antagonism was used to select conditions such as the appropriate mode of
action, and the working range excluding cytotoxicity for the ﬁnal screening. all other compounds were
tested according to the generic protocol: compounds screened for agonism were the reference androgen
17␣-methyldihydrotestosterone (mdht), levonorgestrel, norethynodrel, progesterone, o,p -ddt, and
dibutylphthalate (dbp), while compounds screened for antagonism were the reference anti-androgen ﬂutamide, prochloraz, o,p -ddt, progesterone, norethynodrel, and dbp. cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel
as lactate dehydrogenase release. the prescreen classiﬁed 17␣-mt as androgenic, vinclozolin and linuron
as anti-androgenic and compounds were tested accordingly. in the absence of cytotoxicity, appropriate
androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were detected by both laboratories, o,p -ddt
and dbp had no androgenic activity. across the two laboratories ec50 -values for mdht, 17␣-mt, and
levonorgestrel varied by not more than a factor of 3.4, for norethynodrel by a factor of 9.7. progesterone
effects could not fully be evaluated, as frequently concentration response curves were incomplete. in the
absence of cytotoxicity anti-androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were also detected
in both laboratories. dbp, the putative negative reference compound, was inactive, norethynodrel rather
showed agonistic properties. progesterone was an antagonist at low concentrations, but agonistic properties were observed in one laboratory at high concentrations. since the highest test concentration was
limited to 10 ␮m, for some compounds no complete concentration response curves were obtained and
estimation of ec50 -values was less robust. our data demonstrated that the sop was transferable, and
that the assay was able to rank compounds with strong, weak, and without afﬁnity for the ar and to
discriminate agonists and antagonists. the sensitivity of the assay could be improved further, if the limit
of solubility or beginning cytotoxicity was chosen as the highest test concentration. the assay avoids
the use of tissues from laboratory animals, and thus contributes to the 3r concept. furthermore, it could
be adjusted to an intermediate/high throughput format. on the whole, this palm assay is a promising
candidate for further validation.

1. introduction

2. materials and methods

there is a concern that man-made and natural compounds may
interfere with the endocrine system and thus may affect wildlife
and humans and/or its progeny. whereas early studies focused on
interactions with  xxxg730xxx -mediated signaling and date
back to the 1980s (see [1]), more recently interactions with the
 xxxg183xxx  gained attention [2–6]. both the recommendations to the us environmental protection agency (epa) of the
endocrine disruptor screening and testing advisory committee
(edstac) [7] and the oecd conceptual framework for the testing
and assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals [8] addressed
transactivation assays as important tools to study interactions with
sex hormone receptors, especially because of their capability to discriminate receptor agonists and antagonists, and these assays represent important components of the us epa tier 1 screening battery
and of level 2 of the oecd conceptual frame work. however, despite
more than a decade of research in the ﬁeld of endocrine active
compounds targeting the  xxxg183xxx  (ar), and although
suitable, stably transfected reporter cell lines can be obtained,
no validated human stably transfected androgen sensitive transactivation assay is available. in a joint effort of bayer schering
pharma (bsp) and the flemish institute for technological research
(vito) as partners within the eu-sponsored 6th framework project
reprotect, ﬁrst steps towards such a validation were made. the
androgen sensitive palm cell line, the human prostate cancer cell
line pc-3 stably transfected with human ar and a luciferase gene
under the control of mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv) [9],
has been used for a decade to screen for (anti)androgenic properties of chemicals [9–12]. also at bsp palm cells have served as an
important tool within a panel of screening methods for endocrine
activity and had turned out as a simple and reliable in vitro system. in this work the performance of a standard operation protocol
developed at bsp based on the palm cell line was evaluated thoroughly at bsp. furthermore, the protocol was transferred to the
reprotect partner laboratory vito in belgium, a laboratory familiar with transactivation assays but previously not working with
palm cells to investigate protocol transferability. in both laboratories at least three independent experiments per compound were
performed on different days, and dilutions of test compounds from
deep-frozen aliquoted stocks were freshly prepared for each experiment. the investigation followed a generic protocol prepared and
agreed upon in collaboration with the european centre for the
validation of alternative methods (ecvam) for all reporter gene
assays evaluated within reprotect. the highest concentration of
all chemicals to be tested, if necessary, was limited to 10 ␮m. a
small set of compounds (17␣-methyltestosterone, vinclozolin and
linuron) were tested using a real world scenario, i.e., assuming that
their interaction with the ar was not known: following a prescreening approach with testing for agonism, for antagonism (in
the presence of 0.2 nm 17␣-methyldihydrostestosterone (mdht)
as an androgenic stimulus, corresponding to the ec50 -value) and
in the presence of 100 nm mdht, i.e., excess androgenic stimulus
that would overcome true competitive antagonism, appropriate
conditions for the ﬁnal screening (concentrations, mode) were
selected. all other compounds were tested according to the
generic protocol: compounds screened for agonism were the reference androgen 17␣-methyldihydrostestosterone, levonorgestrel,
norethynodrel, progesterone, o,p -ddt, and dibutylphthalate.
compounds screened for antagonism (in the presence of 0.2 nm
mdht) were the reference anti-androgen ﬂutamide, prochloraz,
o,p -ddt, progesterone, norethynodrel, and dibutylphthalate. in
addition, in all experiments cytotoxicity was assessed as the release
of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium. results were subjected
to an independent statistical analysis. the outcome of this prevalidation exercise is reported herein.

2.1. reference and test compounds and stock solutions
both laboratories used compounds from the same supplier and lot.
17␣-methyldihydrotestosterone (mdht) >99% (cas 521-11-9), levonorgestrel
[=d(−)- xxxd2754xxx ] ≥99% (cas  xxxd2476xxx ), progesterone ≥99% (cas  xxxd3023xxx ), and
norethynodrel >99% (cas 68-23-5) were obtained from sigma, taufkirchen,
germany. o,p -ddt 97.7% (cas 789-02-6) was delivered by sigma–supelco,
taufkirchen, germany, and prochloraz 99.5% (cas 67747-09-5), linuron 99.7%
(cas330-55-2), and vinclozolin 99.6% (cas 50471-44-8) were purchased from
sigma–fluka, taufkirchen, germany.  xxxd2143xxx  ≥99% (cas  xxxd2143xxx , sigma),
17␣-methyltestosterone ≥97% (cas  xxxd2618xxx , fluka), and dibutylphthalate 99.7%;
(cas 84-74-2, sigma) were kindly donated by dr. b. van der burg (biodetection
systems, amsterdam, the netherlands). stock solutions in dmso (100 mm, 10 mm
for mdht) were prepared in sterile glass vials, aliquoted into sterile glass vials and
kept at ≤−18 ◦ c. whenever possible, a minimum of 10 mg substance was used for
the preparation of stock solutions.
2.2. cell culture
the palm cell line was obtained from inserm (montpellier, france). cells were
checked for mycoplasm infection on a regular basis using pcr. only mycoplasmfree cells were used for experimentation. cells were expanded in nutrient mixture
f-12 ham with l-glutamine containing 7% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (fcs),
penicillin (1 u/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml),  xxxd2191xxx  (1 mg/ml) and  xxxd3041xxx 
(1 ␮g/ml) in 5% co2 in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at 37 ◦ c in 250 ml culture ﬂasks
(=75 cm2 ) with 20 ml culture medium. medium was exchanged twice a week. if
conﬂuence was reached, after removal of culture medium and washing the cell
layer with 8 ml ca/mg-free pbs, conﬂuent cells were harvested by incubating the
cell layer with 2.5 ml trypsin–edta solution at 37 ◦ c for 5 min. then, 10 ml culture
medium were added to neutralize trypsin. cells were suspended in culture medium
and aliquots of the suspension were added to 20 ml culture medium in new ﬂasks
and incubated as described above. if the passage number was low, 3–5 new ﬂasks
could be seeded, while at higher passages (>20) up to 20 ﬂasks could be seeded to
reach conﬂuence in about one week.
2.3. adaptation of cells to hormone-free conditions for testing
cells having reached about 70% conﬂuence were adapted to hormone-free conditions. after removal of culture medium, the cell layer was washed with 8 ml
ca/mg-free pbs, 20 ml test medium (nutrient mixture f-12 ham with l-glutamine
containing 7% charcoal-stripped heat-inactivated fcs) was added and cells were
incubated for at least 1.5 (up to 3) days at 37 ◦ c (depending on the day of seeding
for the assay) in a 5% co2 -enriched humidiﬁed air atmosphere.
2.4. treatment of cells
following adaptation to hormone-free conditions cells were harvested as
described above, however, test medium was used to neutralize trypsin. the cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g and the cell pellet was resuspended
in an adequate volume of test medium, resulting in a cell number of more than
1.25e05 cells/ml. following cell counting, the cell suspension was diluted with test
medium to yield 1.25e05 cells/ml, and 80 ␮l aliquots of cell suspension were then
transferred to 96-well plates. the outer wells lining a plate were not used for testing to avoid any edge effect. subsequently these wells were ﬁlled with 100 ␮l test
medium or pbs. after three days, at 37 ◦ c in a 5% co2 -enriched humidiﬁed air atmosphere cells were exposed to test compounds according to the approach chosen.
prior to dosing, cells were checked microscopically for infections by random inspection of wells. plates with infected cells were discarded. test compounds (together
with mdht, if antagonism was investigated) were added in 20 ␮l test medium containing 0.1% dmso. the ﬁnal dmso concentration was 0.02% in all wells. for each
treatment condition triplicate incubations (=triplicate wells) were run. following
dosing, cells were incubated for one day (22–24 h). when this work was initiated,
a concentration of 10 ␮m was discussed at oecd as the upper limit concentration
in transactivation assays. in line with this consideration, the highest concentration
tested, if necessary, was 10 ␮m.
2.5. prescreening approach
one plate per compound was used. cells were treated with test compound (0,
1e−13, 1e−11, 1e−09, 1e−07, and 1e−05 m) alone or in combination with two concentrations of mdht (0.20 nm approximately the ec50 -value, and 100 nm, 500 times
the ec50 -value).
2.6. screening for ar agonism
within each series of experiments, a full concentration response was conducted
for the reference androgen mdht on one plate. the upper part of this plate contained
a medium blank (no cell control), vehicle control and eight concentrations of mdht

conditions correspond to ﬁgure (a).

(0.010, 0.033, 0.10, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3, 10, 100 nm) with the same set-up, the lower part
was used to investigate a test compound. all further plates contained a medium
blank (no cell control), vehicle control and seven or eight concentrations of test
compound on the upper part and vehicle control, eight concentrations of another
test compound and mdht (100 nm) on the lower part. levonorgestrel was tested
at 0.010, 0.033, 0.10, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3, 10, and 33 nm, norethynodrel at 0.33, 1.0, 3.0,
10, 33, 100, 330, and 1000 nm, and progesterone, o,p -ddt, and dbp at 0.010, 0.033,
0.10, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3, and 10 ␮m. 17␣-methyltestosterone was tested as chosen by the
laboratories based on the outcome of the prescreening.
2.7. screening for ar antagonism
within each series of experiments, a full concentration response was conducted
for the reference anti-androgen ﬂutamide on one plate. the upper part of this plate
contained a medium blank (no cell control), vehicle control, 0.20 nm mdht and
0.20 nm mdht combined with seven different concentrations of ﬂutamide (0.001,
0.010, 0.10, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3, 10 ␮m). with the same set-up, the lower part was used to
investigate a test compound. all further plates contained a medium blank (no cell
control), vehicle control, 0.20 nm mdht, and 0.20 nm mdht combined with seven
different concentrations of test compound on the upper part and vehicle control,
0.20 nm mdht, and 0.20 nm mdht combined with seven different concentrations
of another test compound or combined with 10 ␮m ﬂutamide. prochloraz, o,p -ddt,
progesterone, and dbp were tested at 0.010, 0.033, 0.10, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3, and 10 ␮m,
norethynodrel at 0.33, 1.0, 3.0, 10, 33, 100, and 1000 nm. vinclozolin and linuron
were tested as chosen by the laboratories based on the outcome of the prescreening.
erroneously, at bsp initially too low concentrations (maximum 1 ␮m) of vinclozolin
and linuron were tested. resulting data were insufﬁcient for a meaningful evaluation
and were not reported.

stop solution to wells, plates were agitated on a shaker at room temperature for
about 10 s. fluorescence was then measured at 580 nm with excitation at 540 nm.
after subtracting the mean value obtained for the medium blank (=no cell control),
mean values and standard deviations of replicate incubations/wells were calculated.
ldh activity in the media from treated cells was related to ldh activity in media
from corresponding dmso control cells and expressed as percent of control.

2.10. preliminary performance criteria
for cytotoxicity, an increase of ldh secreted into the medium by at least 50%
(compared to the dmso control) was considered as a cytotoxic response. test
compound concentrations characterized as cytotoxic were not evaluated for transactivation. in the prescreening, an induction factor of ≥4.0-fold for 100 nm mdht
and of ≥2.5-fold for 0.2 nm mdht should be observed for the reference agonist.
a test chemical is considered an agonist provided that the response of the test
chemical only, qualitatively resembles that of the reference agonist, mdht, seen
as a concentration-dependently increased signal compared to the solvent control.
in case that an antagonistic effect was observed at the low mdht concentration
(0.2 nm), the concentration response curve should be considerably shifted to higher
concentrations in the presence of the high mdht concentration (100 nm) if true
antagonism had occurred. when screening for agonism, a sigmoid concentration
response should be observed for mdht. a maximally stimulating concentration
of mdht (100 nm or above) should result in an induction factor of ≥4.0, whereas
the ec50 of mdht should be in the range 0.1–1 nm. when screening for antagonism, 0.2 nm mdht should result in an induction factor of ≥2.5, ﬂutamide should
concentration-dependently reduce the agonistic effect of 0.2 nm mdht, and at
10 ␮m ﬂutamide should reduce the net increase of luciferase activity (brought about
by 0.2 nm mdht) by ≥70%.

2.8. determination of luciferase activity in cells
2.11. statistical evaluation
at the end of the incubation period residual medium was removed and 30 ␮l
reporter lysis buffer (component of luciferase assay system no. e4530, promega,
mannheim, germany) per well was added. plates were shaken at room temperature
for 30 min and were then deep-frozen at −80 ◦ c and were kept frozen up to one
week. prior to measurement, plates were thawed at room temperature. following
addition of 50 ␮l luciferase assay reagent per well, luminescence was measured.
2.9. cytotoxicity assay
cytotoxicity was measured as the release of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) into
the culture medium using the cytotox-one homogeneous membrane integrity
assay (promega, mannheim, germany). at the end of the incubation period, 50 ␮l
medium per well from each plate was transferred to fresh white 96-well microtiter
plates and 50 ␮l cytotox-one reagent was added per well. after shaking for 30 s,
plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. following addition of 25 ␮l

prior to ﬁtting a dose–response model and estimation of ec50 the mean blank
signal was subtracted from the response (luciferase signal of each well). after subtraction the response of treated wells was divided by the mean of the corresponding
solvent control. the four-parametric log-logistic function
f (x) = 1 +

2 − 1
1 + exp(3 (log(x) − 4 ))

was ﬁtted to the transformed data using the drm function of r-package drc. ec50 and
95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated using the ed function of the same package
[13,14]. parameter  4 is the log of the ec50 , i.e., the log of the concentration with
a response half-way between upper response limit  2 and lower response limit  1 .
parameter  3 is the slope parameter. parameters  1 und  2 were constrained to be
non-negative.

3. results
3.1. outcome of the prescreening approach
17␣-methyltestosterone (17␣-mt), vinclozolin, and linuron
were tested using a real world scenario and subjected to a prescreening in order to select the relevant mode of testing and the
most appropriate concentration range. the prescreening included
testing for agonism, for antagonism (in the presence of 0.2 nm
mdht as androgenic stimulus, corresponding to the ec50 -value)
and in the presence of 100 nm mdht, i.e., excess androgenic stimulus that would overcome true competitive antagonism.
both at vito and bsp, compared to the corresponding controls 17␣-mt (further) induced luciferase activity at concentrations
of ≥10−9 m both in the absence and presence of 0.2 nm mdht
until a plateau was reached. 17␣-mt was unable to further
increase the extent of luciferase induction brought about by 100 nm
mdht (not shown). these features indicated ar agonism, subsequently 17␣-mt was tested accordingly. in both laboratories
neither vinclozolin nor linuron were able to induce luciferase
activity. however, at both institutions vinclozolin concentrationdependently at 1e−07 m and 1e−05 m and linuron moderately at
1e−05 m decreased luciferase induction brought about by 0.2 nm
mdht. these suppressive effects were no longer observed in the
presence of 100 nm mdht (not shown). these features were in
line with ar antagonism, and subsequently vinclozolin and linuron
were investigated accordingly in both laboratories.
neither bsp nor vito observed cytotoxicity of 17␣-mt, vinclozolin, and linuron up to the highest concentration tested (not
shown).
preliminary performance standards were met, as induction factors of ≥4.0-fold for 100 nm mdht and of ≥2.5-fold for 0.2 nm
mdht were observed (not shown) and as for vinclozolin and linuron their known antagonistic response in the presence of 0.2 nm
mdht was abolished by 100 nm mdht.
3.2. detection of androgenicity
17␣-methyldihydrotestosterone (mdht) as reference compound, 17␣-mt levonorgestrel, norethynodrel, progesterone,
o,p -ddt, and dibutylphthalate were tested for ar agonism. 17␣mt was tested at concentrations ﬁxed by the laboratories on the
basis of their prescreening results, all other compounds were tested
according to concentrations ﬁxed in the generic protocol. similar
results were obtained both at bsp and vito (fig. 1a and b): except
o,p -ddt and dibutylphthalate that were inactive (not shown), all
other tested compounds were able to induce luciferase activity.
ec50 -values obtained at both institutions are given in tables 1 and 2.
ec50 -values for progesterone showed considerable variability and
were frequently associated with broad conﬁdence intervals, as the
highest concentration of 10 ␮m obviously was too low to consistently end up in a sufﬁciently complete sigmoid concentration
response curve suitable for the estimation of accurate ec50 -values,
however, agonism was clearly demonstrable in both labs. thus,
ec50 -values for progesterone should be considered with caution.
in terms of ec50 -values the following identical rank order could be
established both at bsp and vito:
mdht > 17␣-methyltestosterone > levonorgestrel
 norethynodrel  progesterone
all test compounds were studied in parallel for potential cytotoxicity. both at bsp and vito, none of them was able to increase
ldh release into the medium. rarely occurring increases were mild,
without concentration dependency and not reproducible across

13

experiments and thus were not considered as true indication of
cytotoxicity. accordingly, within the concentration tested, no cytotoxicity was observed.
preliminary performance standards were mostly met. for mdht
a sigmoid concentration response was always obtained, and a
maximally stimulating concentration of mdht provided induction
factors of 9.7, 9.6, and 8.6 (bsp) and of 3.7, 16.8, 5.6, 20.7, 12.8, and
15.6 (vito). thus, only in one out of nine experiments across both
laboratories the minimum performance of ≥4.0-fold induction was
not achieved. only in one experiment (see table 2) the ec50 -value
for mdht was outside the ﬁxed limits and was slightly below the
lower limit (0.1 nm).
3.3. detection of anti-androgenicitiy
 xxxd2143xxx  as reference compound, prochloraz, norethynodrel,
progesterone, o,p -ddt, vinclozolin, linuron, and dibutylphthalate
were tested for ar antagonism in the presence of 0.2 nm mdht.
vinclozolin and linuron were tested at concentrations ﬁxed by
the laboratories on the basis of their prescreening results, the
other compounds were tested according to concentrations ﬁxed
in the generic protocol. except dibutylphthalate that was inactive, and norethynodrel rather showing agonist properties at the
higher concentrations (not shown), all compounds were able to
suppress mdht-induced luciferase activity to a variable degree.
as most compounds were only weakly active, the highest concentration of 10 ␮m obviously was too low to consistently end up in
a sufﬁciently complete concentration response curve suitable for
robust ec50 -estimation. thus, ec50 -values were frequently associated with considerable variability and should be used with caution.
similarly, not all compounds  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m were able to decrease the
mdht-mediated induction of luciferase by 50% or more. this was
the case for linuron at bsp, and for most experiments with linuron, and prochloraz at vito, while occasionally for ﬂutamide at
vito. progesterone was a case of its own. at low concentrations
it concentration-dependently decreased the mdht-mediated net
induction of luciferase by about 60% (bsp) and 40% (vito). at
bsp higher concentration did not contribute to further inhibition,
whereas at vito 3 and 10 ␮m concentration-dependently induced
an increase of the luciferase signal beyond the corresponding control value. ec50 -values obtained at both institutions are given in
tables 3 and 4. an overlay of typical concentration response curves
from both laboratories is given in fig. 2a and b.
all test compounds were studied in parallel for potential cytotoxicity. both at bsp and vito, none of them was able to increase
ldh release into the medium. rarely occurring increases were mild,
without concentration dependency and not reproducible across
experiments and thus were not considered as true indication of
cytotoxicity (not shown).
preliminary performance standards were mostly met. for
0.2 nm mdht an induction factor of ≥2.50 was consistently
observed.  xxxd2143xxx  dose-dependently decreased the agonistic
effect of 0.2 nm mdht, however, the net induction of luciferase
activity brought about by 0.2 nm mdht was not always decreased
by ≥70%  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m ﬂutamide (not shown).
4. discussion
the value of hormone sensitive transactivation assays both as
a mechanistic tool to characterize receptor-mediated endocrine
activity, but also as an important screening assay for endocrine
active compounds, is well recognized. an important feature of such
assays is their capability to discriminate agonists and antagonists.
interestingly, despite more than one decade of research in the ﬁeld
of endocrine active compounds targeting at the  xxxg183xxx ,

compared to the vehicle control, a decrease at low concentrations is followed by an increase above the control level at higher concentrations.

properties (vinclozolin, linuron), and a proper selection of the relevant concentrations for the ﬁnal screening could be made. in this
prevalidation exercise, the highest concentration was limited to
10 ␮m. this may be too low to detect weakly active compounds and
for the prescreen and if necessary also for the ﬁnal screening, rather
the limit of solubility, the onset of cytotoxicity or a concentration
as high as 1 mm is recommended as the highest test concentration. a similar approach was recently taken when drafting the oecd
test guideline for the stably transfected human  xxxg730xxx -␣
transcriptional assay [15].
assessment of cytotoxicity in transactivation assays is important especially if screening for potential antagonists is performed
in order to distinguish cytotoxic effects from true antagonistic
effects. the approach used in this work was very convenient, as after
removal of medium to measure ldh release into the medium as a
marker of cytotoxicity, the same cells could be lysed and examined
for luciferase activity. recent work showed that the applied cytotoxicity test was as sensitive as other cytotoxicity tests [16]. none
of the test compounds showed up as cytotoxic, which is probably
due to the low (≤10 ␮m) concentrations tested.
across the two laboratories ec50 -values for the agonists mdht,
17␣-mt, and levonorgestrel varied by not more than a factor of
3.4 (ratio of highest to lowest ec50 for a given compound irrespective of the laboratory), for norethynodrel by a factor of 9.7. these
low values, especially in the light of the low number of independent experiments from two laboratories indicate that the protocol
is transferable and the assay is capable to accurately assess recep-

tor agonism with only small variability. effects of progesterone
could not fully be evaluated, as frequently incomplete concentration response curves were obtained. also for anti-androgenicity
testing results across the laboratories were comparable, however,
an in depth quantitative comparison was not possible, since most
compounds were only weakly active, and limitation of the top
concentration to 10 ␮m frequently resulted in incomplete concentration response curve not suitable for robust ec50 -estimation. it
should be kept in mind that this ﬁnding does not argue against the
assay per se, but rather suggests a modiﬁed regimen with higher
test concentrations. importantly, the endocrine activity of all test
compounds could be detected and classiﬁed.
with regard to further validation and a ﬁnal protocol, performance criteria are important. the preliminary criteria were
well selected and mostly met: the fold-induction for the various approaches were achieved and mostly surpassed and may be
increased further. only on one plate throughout the whole effort
the requested fold-induction for mdht was not met, obviously as
the consequence of an untypically high response in the solvent
control. the maximum fold-induction induced by mdht typically
exceeded 4.0-fold, the lower limit ﬁxed in the recently adopted
oecd test guideline 455 for the stably transfected human  xxxg730xxx -␣ transcriptional activation assay for detection of
estrogenic agonist activity and met or exceeded the maximum foldinduction (in response to dht) reported for the ar-ecoscreentm
(10.7-fold) [17]. an even higher fold-induction was reported for
the ar-calux® assay (30-fold) [18]. in our assay mdht always

frequently no full concentration response curve was observed, as the highest concentration was limited to 10 ␮m, and estimated ec50 -values were less robust. thus,
rather a range is given.
b

yielded sigmoid concentration response curves and with only one
exception, ec50 -values for mdht were within the requested range.
on the basis of all available data, the range may be shifted to
slightly lower concentrations, e.g., 0.05–0.5 nm, but should not be
broadened. when screening for antagonism the requested reduction by ≥70% of mdht-induced net transactivation by 10 ␮m of
the reference anti-androgen ﬂutamide was not achieved in each
experiment and on each plate. this partial failure is most likely
due to the fact that in this series of experiments the androgenic
stimulus 0.2 nm mdht, as deﬁned in the sop, did not correspond
to an ec50 -value, but rather to an ec65 -value possibly triggering
a modest loss of sensitivity. thus, further versions of the protocol
should request experimental determination of the ec50 of mdht
immediately before anti-androgenicity screening and the use of
the observed ec50 as androgenic stimulus. in addition, the use of a
stronger anti-androgen such as  xxxd2725xxx  as reference should be
considered.
an important step in the evaluation of an assay is the comparison of assay data with data from similar assays observed for the
same test compounds. in table 5, results from the investigation of
agonists reported herein are compared to reporter gene assay data
of groups using different cell lines [17,19]. mdht is rarely used as
a reference androgen, however, it can readily be compared with
dht, as receptor binding afﬁnity of both compounds is quite similar [20]. irrespective of the methodological differences, ec50 -values
reported herein were quite comparable to those observed in the
published cell culture experiments, and the ranking for the afﬁnity of agonists was similar across different assays and laboratories.
our ranking of agonists also closely followed recently published
ar binding afﬁnities [20]. a possible exception could be progesterone. it was less active as an agonist in relation to its ar binding
afﬁnity. however, it cannot be excluded that it is no true ar agonist
and that its effect is rather mediated via an activated glucocorticoid
receptor (gr). progesterone has afﬁnity for the gr, and the pmmtvneo luc reporter in palm cells also responds to a ligand-activated
gr [21]. indeed, high concentrations of ﬂutamide were unable to
suppress progesterone-stimulated luciferase induction in palm
cells (freyberger, unpublished). likewise, in the androgen sensitive mda-kb2 reporter cell line, also carrying the pmmtv-neo luc
reporter, the potent anti-androgen hydroxy-ﬂutamide could not
suppress progesterone-stimulated reporter gene induction [21]. in
table 6 our results of the antagonist screening are compared to
reporter gene assay data obtained with the ar-ecoscreentm [17].
the outcome of antagonism studies considerably depends on the
concentration of the androgenic stimulus added together with the
test compound, however, with respect to the response to the androgenic stimulus, our and data of araki et al. [17] are similar and
thus the results are comparable. irrespective of the methodologi-

cal differences, results obtained in both reporter cell lines suggest
comparable sensitivity. interestingly, progesterone when tested
at vito reproducibly showed a biphasic response showing antiandrogenic properties at low and agonism at high concentrations.
the roughly estimated ec50 -values for the antagonist part of the
response were frequently around 25e−08 and thus similar to the
bsp results. it remains to be elucidated whether a similar biphasic
response could also be obtained at bsp when increasing the concentration range (slightly) above 10 ␮m. one may speculate that
such a biphasic response could be an overlay of different mechanisms such as antagonism at the androgen and agonism at the
 xxxg1601xxx .
our data demonstrate that across laboratories the assay was
able to reliably rank compounds with strong, weak, and without
afﬁnity for the ar and to discriminate agonists and antagonists.
employing a human stably transfected cell line it avoids use of animal tissues, and thus contributes to the 3r concept. furthermore,
the assay could be adjusted to an intermediate/high throughput
format. in terms of the ecvam modular approach of validation, the
data set presented herein corresponds to the ﬁrst four modules,
namely test deﬁnition, within-laboratory variability, transferability and between-laboratory variability [22]. according to our data
the assay is a promising candidate for further validation. it may be
used to screen for endocrine-modulating compounds with afﬁnity for the ar, to further investigate equivocal results from other
in vitro assays and it may also be helpful as a mechanistic tool in
order to characterize effects on the endocrine system observed in
animal studies. whether this human stably transfected androgen
sensitive transactivation assay can reliably predict the outcome of
