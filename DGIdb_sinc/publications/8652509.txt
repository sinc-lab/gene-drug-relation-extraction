abstract:

the cyclooxygenase activity of the membrane protein prostaglandin h2 synthase isoform 1
( xxxg1883xxx ) is the target of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids). the x-ray crystal structures
of  xxxg1883xxx  in complex with the nsaids  xxxd2141xxx  and bromoaspirin have been determined previously
[picot, d., et al. (1994) nature 367, 243-249; loll, p. j., et al. (1995) nat. struct. biol. 2, 637-643].
we report here the preparation and characterization of novel potent iodinated analogs of the nsaids
indomethacin and  xxxd3265xxx , as well as the refined x-ray crystal structures of their complexes with  xxxg1883xxx . the pghs-iodosuprofen complex structure has been refined at 3.5 å to an r-value of 0.189 and
shows the  xxxd3265xxx  analog to share a common mode of binding with  xxxd2141xxx . the pghsiodoindomethacin complex structure has been refined at 4.5 å to an r-value of 0.254. the low resolution
of the  xxxd2376xxx  complex structure precludes detailed modeling of drug-enzyme interactions,
but the electron-dense iodine atom of the inhibitor has been unambiguously located, allowing for the
placement and approximate orientation of the inhibitor in the enzyme’s active site. we have modeled
two equally likely binding modes for  xxxd2376xxx , corresponding to the two principal conformers
of the inhibitor. like  xxxd2141xxx , iodosuprofen and  xxxd2376xxx  bind at the end of the long channel
which leads into the enzyme active site. binding at this site presumably blocks access of substrate to
tyr-385, a residue essential for catalysis. no evidence is seen for significant protein conformational
differences between the  xxxd2376xxx  and iodosuprofen of  xxxd2141xxx  complex structures.

prostaglandin h2 synthase (pghs,1 also known as cyclooxygenase; ec 1.14.99.1) catalyzes the two-step conversion of  xxxd208xxx  to prostaglandin g2 and thence to
prostaglandin h2, the first committed steps in the biosynthesis
of a class of potent hormones which includes various
prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes [for recent
reviews, see garavito et al. (1994) and smith & marnett
(1994)]. while pghs catalyzes both steps of this catalytic

process (known as the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase steps,
respectively), the reactions are carried out in two spatially
distinct active sites. the cyclooxygenase activity is inhibited
by the class of compounds known as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), which includes the commercially and pharmacologically important agents aspirin,
ibuprofen, naproxen, and indomethacin (loll & garavito,
1994).  xxxd208xxx  metabolites derived from prostaglandin g2 are known to be powerful mediators of the
inflammatory response, and the nsaids achieve their
antiinflammatory and antipyretic effects chiefly through
blocking prostaglandin g2 formation via inhibition of pghs.
at least two isoforms of pghs are known to be expressed
in mammalian tissues. the first,  xxxg1883xxx , is expressed
constitutively in most tissue types and appears to be the
product of a “housekeeping” gene, supporting the low levels
of prostanoid biosynthesis required for maintaining homeostasis. in contrast, the second isoform,  xxxg1884xxx , displays a
radically different tissue distribution and pattern of expression. while constitutively expressed in brain cells,  xxxg1884xxx 
can be rapidly induced, by cytokines and other mitogens, to
high levels of expression in a limited number of cell types,
including synovial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and
monocytes. this transient  xxxg1884xxx  expression is elicited by
specific inflammatory stimuli and is responsible for the
synthesis of large quantities of prostanoids seen to occur
during inflammation (hla et al., 1993; herschman, 1994).
hence, drug therapy aimed at reducing inflammation should

cyclooxygenase-nsaid complex structures
be targeted toward isoform 2. most nsaids currently in
clinical use, however, are known to inhibit both isoforms of
pghs with little selectivity, and during extended therapy
many nsaids cause ulcerogenic side effects most likely due
to  xxxg1883xxx  inhibition in the stomach. the two isoforms have
been shown to differ pharmacologically, and it should prove
possible to exploit these differences to target  xxxg1884xxx ,
thereby decoupling the inhibition of inflammatory prostanoid
biosynthesis from the inhibition of background levels of
prostanoid biosynthesis required for normal physiological
functioning (isakson et al., 1995; smith et al., 1994; vane
& botting, 1995). all the nsaids are generally thought to
target the cyclooxygenase activity of pghs; however, the
mechanisms by which they act vary widely. some inhibit
by covalently modifying the enzyme, some are competitive
with respect to  xxxd208xxx , and some are slow-binding
inhibitors. information about the structural basis of nsaid
binding by  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  should help to clarify why
different compounds act by different mechanisms and may
prove valuable in this process of designing isoform-specific
inhibitors.
pghs is an integral membrane protein that requires
solubilization with detergent in order to remove it from the
lipid bilayer and to purify it. the 3.5 å structure of the
complex of ovine  xxxg1883xxx  with  xxxd2141xxx  has been
determined from crystals prepared in the presence of the
nonionic detergent octyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (beta-og) (picot
et al., 1994), and the resolution of this structure has recently
been extended to 3.1 å (picot, loll, and garavito, unpublished). this structure opens the door for rigorous structural
analysis of different pghs-nsaid complexes. pghs
crystals, however, are very fragile, difficult to reproduce,
exquisitely sensitive to changes in temperature and mother
liquor composition, and consist of roughly 72% solvent by
volume. in many cases, these factors conspire to limit the
available resolution. in addition, the diffraction quality of
the crystals obtained varies significantly as one changes the
inhibitor bound to the enzyme.
because of these experimental difficulties, we have probed
the cyclooxygenase active site with nsaid analogs labeled
with heavy atoms such as iodine or bromine. we reason
that even in cases where crystals of pghs-nsaid complexes do not diffract to near 3 å, the electron-dense halogen
will be readily located in difference fourier maps, enabling
us to position and orient the nsaid analog in the active
site. such a strategy for crystallographic analysis of enzymeligand interactions is not new (olsen et al., 1975; abdallah
et al., 1975, 1979) and allowed us to unambiguously assign
density observed in the initial 3.5 å mir maps to  xxxd2141xxx  and dock that compound into the active site (picot et
al., 1994) and to analyze the structural basis of aspirin activity
by examining the structure of pghs inactivated by a
brominated aspirin analog (loll et al., 1995a). here, we
report the continued application of this strategy to analyze
the structures of two complexes of pghs with iodinated
nsaid analogs: a complex of pghs and a  xxxd3265xxx  analog
refined at 3.5 å resolution and a complex of pghs and an
indomethacin analog determined and refined at 4.5 å
resolution.
experimental procedures
materials.  xxxd208xxx  was obtained from cayman
chemicals (ann arbor, mi). detergents were obtained from

biochemistry, vol. 35, no. 23, 1996 7331
calbiochem (beta-og and decyl beta-d-maltoside; la jolla, ca)
and pierce (tween-20; rockford, il).  xxxd3265xxx  and indomethacin were obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo).
other reagents and peg-4000 were obtained from aldrich
chemical co. (milwaukee, wi) and fluka (ronkonkoma,
ny) and were of the highest quality commercially available.
nmr spectra were acquired at room temperature with varian
xl-300 and general electric gn omega 300 spectrometers.
dept and cosy experiments were performed using standard pulse sequences. electron impact mass spectra (eims)
were recorded at 70 ev with a double focusing vg analytical
mass spectrometer. samples for eims were introduced by
direct insertion with solid probes. mass measurements for
the high-resolution mass spectra (hrms) were done by
software peak matching using perfluorokerosene (pfk) as
the reference standard.
enzyme purification and crystallization. pghs used for
kinetic analyses was purified by the method of mevkh et al.
(1985) and stored frozen at -70 °c in 100 µl aliquots.
enzyme used for crystallization experiments was purified
as described (garavito et al., 1995). all crystals were grown
by the hanging drop method. crystals of the iodosuprofen
complex were prepared by dialyzing a 12 mg/ml solution
of pghs versus a buffer containing 20 mm sodium
phosphate, ph 6.7, 80 mm nacl, 0.6% (w/w) beta-og, and
100 µm iodosuprofen overnight at 4 °c. sufficient quantities
of a 40% (w/w) stock solution of peg-4000 in water were
added to the protein to bring it to 2% peg (w/w); 5 µl drops
of the protein solution were placed over wells containing 1
ml of 6.5% peg-4000, 65 mm sodium phosphate, and 260
mm nacl and incubated at 18 °c. large single crystals
appeared within 3 weeks.
crystals prepared by cocrystallization of pghs and
 xxxd2376xxx  invariably diffracted very poorly, if at all,
and attempts to soak  xxxd2376xxx  into crystals grown
in the absence of inhibitor were also not successful. the
formation of the  xxxd2141xxx -pghs complex is reversible,
albeit slowly, with a t1/2 of several hours. hence, crystals
of the  xxxd2376xxx  complex were prepared by ligand
exchange as follows: crystals of the  xxxd2141xxx  complex,
grown as described (garavito et al., 1995), were transferred
to a soak buffer containing 10% peg-4000, 150 mm nacl,
0.5% beta-og, 1 mm  xxxd2376xxx , and 20 mm sodium
phosphate at ph 6.7; after several washes, the crystals were
incubated overnight at 18 °c prior to data collection.
enzyme assays. pghs cyclooxygenase activity was
measured by monitoring oxygen consumption at 25 °c
essentially as described (kulmacz & lands, 1987). briefly,
enzyme was incubated for 90 s at a concentration of 50 nm
in a buffer containing 0.1 m tris, ph 8.0, 1 mm phenol,
500 nm hemin, and the desired concentration of inhibitor,
after which the reaction was initiated by addition of  xxxd208xxx  (18 nmol per 600 µl, 30 µm). measurements
were carried out with an instech clark electrode (plymouth
meeting, pa) and a yellow springs instrument co. biological

suspended in 5 ml of water. iodine (5.6 ml of 0.5 m i2 in
aqueous 3 m ki, 2.8 mmol) was added, and the mixture
was swirled in a boiling water bath for 10 min, resulting in
significant loss of the yellow color, after which it was cooled
in an ice bath. the resulting gummy precipitate was washed
with 3 m ki and water and then dissolved in ethanol.
evaporation of the ethanol yielded a brown viscous oil, which
set to a glass overnight at 4 °c. lyophilization of this
material yielded 0.46 g of 1 (1.2 mmol, 9.8% yield).

preparation of 1-(4-iodobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid (2). the synthesis of 2 was modeled after
a reported adaptation of the fischer indole synthesis (yamamoto, 1967, 1968); see scheme 2. p-methoxyphenylhydrazine (12.3 g, 89 mmol; freshly prepared from the hydrochloride) was suspended in 250 ml of et2o on ice under
n2. to this was slowly added dropwise acetaldehyde (5.5
ml, 97 mmol) in et2o (5 ml). after 1 h the mixture was
allowed to warm to room temperature, the et2o was
evaporated, and the resulting dark orange oil was distilled
under vacuum. the distillate (10.3 g, 63 mmol) was
dissolved in 45 ml of et2o and cooled on ice. to this was
added p-iodobenzoyl chloride (16.8 g, 63 mmol) in 50 ml
of et2o with vigorous stirring. the resulting precipitate was
washed with water and lyophilized (17.4 g, 44 mmol). the
powder was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and toluene
(1:9 v/v, 400 ml) and cooled in an ethylene glycol/dry ice

temperature was maintained between 80 and 90 °c for 3 h.
the mixture was then cooled and poured into water. the

diffraction data collection. diffraction data sets were
collected with the enraf-nonius fast (fast scanning
area sensitive tv detector) area detector mounted on an
elliott gx-21 rotating anode x-ray generator producing cu
kr radiation. the iodosuprofen complex data set was
assembled from two crystals, while the  xxxd2376xxx 
complex data set was taken from a single crystal. crystals
were maintained at 4 °c throughout data collection. individual data scans were integrated and profile-fit using the
madnes and procor software packages (messerschmidt
& pflugrath, 1987; kabsch, 1988) and were combined and
scaled by the rotovata and agrovata programs
from the ccp4 program suite (collaborative computational
project, no. 4, 1994). data collection statistics are summarized in table 1.

all inhibitor, carbohydrate, and detergent molecules from the
3.1 å refined pghs- xxxd2141xxx  structure (picot et al.,
unpublished); individual refined b-values for each atom were
retained without further refinement. the asymmetric unit
of the crystal contains two molecules of pghs which are
related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (ncs) axis,
and the model was constrained to obey strict ncs throughout
the course of the refinement. the starting model yielded an
r-value of 0.50 for all data between 8 and 3.5 å. it was
subjected to rigid body refinement against the diffraction data
using x-plor (brunger, 1992), lowering the r-value to
0.242 (free r ) 0.247). at this point, 2fo - fc and fo fc maps were calculated and revealed clear density for four
n- xxxd2683xxx  residues and one beta-og molecule bound
to each pghs monomer. these features were observed in
the 3.1 å  xxxd2141xxx  complex structure but were omitted
from the rigid body refinement and the subsequent map
calculation; their appearance in the maps provides a good
check on the quality of the phases. these maps also show
clear density for the iodosuprofen inhibitors within each
monomer, including extremely strong density for the iodine
atoms (see figure 2). all of the strong features observed in
the fo - fc map are accounted for by the carbohydrate,
detergent, and inhibitor. these molecules were incorporated
into the model in an iterative manner, interspersed with cycles
of conjugate gradient positional refinement, refinement of
overall anisotropic b-values, and model inspection. the
refinement was judged to have converged after the r-value
for reflections between 8 and 3.5 å stabilized at 0.189 (free
r ) 0.231). an fo - fc map calculated at this stage shows
no features greater than 4 standard deviations; the density
which is present at lower contour levels is randomly
distributed and suggests no alterations to the model. this
model has been deposited in the protein data bank as entry
1pge.

refinement of the  xxxd2376xxx -pghs complex
structure. the refinement of this structure began with the
identical starting model as did the iodosuprofen structure,
the 3.1 å pghs- xxxd2141xxx  structure from which the
 xxxd2141xxx  molecule, carbohydrate, and bound detergent had
been removed. before any refinement, this model yielded
an r-value of 0.37 for all data between 8 and 4.5 å. as
with iodosuprofen, the two molecules of pghs in the
asymmetric unit were constrained to obey strict ncs during
the refinement. rigid body refinement and refinement of
an overall anisotropic ∆b reduced the r-value to 0.282 (free
r ) 0.285). an fo - fc map calculated at this stage revealed
good electron density for the same four n- xxxd2683xxx 
molecules per pghs monomer observed in the other pghs
complex structures, providing an independent check on the
quality of the calculated phases. the asymmetric unit of
this fo - fc map contains two strong peaks corresponding
to the two iodine atoms, as well as weak and discontinuous
density in other parts of the two active sites. these weaker
features are presumably derived from the light atoms of the
inhibitor. no other significant density was observed above
the 3sigma level. after the carbohydrate was added to the model,
the  xxxd2376xxx  molecule was placed by fixing the
iodine at the site of high electron density and building the
remainder of the molecule by hand. two possible orientations of the inhibitor were identified, one of which requires
the cis conformer of the inhibitor and the other the trans
(see figure 4). each of these models was subjected to rigid
body refinement, allowing the protein and inhibitor to move
independently, which reduced the r-value to 0.276 (trans)
and 0.277 (cis); free r ) 0.277 and 0.274, respectively.
while some bad contacts between the protein and the
inhibitor persisted after these refinements, it appeared that
these could be alleviated by small side chain motions in the
active site. accordingly, the following refinement protocol
was devised. a core set of atoms (set 1; 570 atoms)
comprising the inhibitor and all protein atoms within 8 å of
the inhibitor were subjected to positional refinement by
conjugate gradient minimization. in addition, a 3 å thick
shell of atoms was defined around the atoms in set 1 and
denoted set 2 (715 atoms); atoms in this shell were allowed
to move but were made subject to harmonic restraints
tethering them to their original positions. the remaining
4332 atoms were fixed. coordinates for atoms in sets 1 and
2 represent 3855 degrees of freedom, which may be
compared with the 8235 reflections in the working set and
945 reflections in the test set. after 300 cycles of this
conjugate gradient refinement, the r-value dropped to 0.254
for the trans model (free r ) 0.264) and to 0.254 for the
cis model (free r ) 0.267). these models have been
deposited in the protein data bank as entries 1pgf (cis)
and 1pgg (trans).

pghs inhibition by iodinated nsaid analogs.  xxxd3265xxx 
and indomethacin both show time-dependent inhibition of
the cyclooxygenase activity of pghs (kulmacz & lands,
1985; loll, unpublished observations). we have verified that
iodosuprofen and  xxxd2376xxx  also display similar timedependent inhibition (loll, unpublished observations) but
have not determined the kinetic constants. figure 1 shows

observed with the parent compounds. while it is evident
from the figure that the introduction of the iodine atom onto
the thiophene ring of  xxxd3265xxx  has a slight deleterious effect
on binding, increasing the ic50 value from 0.20 to 1.0 µm,
the iodinated analog is still a highly effective inhibitor of
the cyclooxygenase activity. in contrast, replacement of the

refined structures. refinement statistics for the two
pghs complex structures are given in table 1. both show
reasonable agreement statistics and good geometry, consistent
with the resolution range of the available data. luzzati
analysis gives an estimate of the rms coordinate error for
the pghs-iodosuprofen complex structure of 0.3 å. the
lower resolution available for the pghs- xxxd2376xxx 
structure precludes use of the luzzati method for estimating
coordinate error. both structures benefited from the use of
the protein coordinates from the pghs- xxxd2141xxx  complex refined at 3.1 å (picot et al., unpublished). the higher
resolution of the pghs- xxxd2141xxx  complex structure
yielded a higher observable to parameter ratio, allowing for
the refinement of restrained individual atomic b-values.
these refined b-values were retained for the protein atoms
in the pghs complex structures with iodosuprofen and
 xxxd2376xxx  without further refinement. in both cases,
this approach yielded better agreement with the data than

loll et al.
the use of a single overall b-value, as evidenced by r- and
free r-values after the initial cycles of rigid body refinement
using the protein alone. the rms difference in cr positions
between the  xxxd2141xxx  and iodosuprofen structures is 0.19
å. this small value and the low r-values obtained throughout the iodosuprofen refinement (particularly in the early
stages) suggest that the protein structures in the  xxxd2141xxx 
and iodosuprofen complexes do not differ significantly at
this resolution.
since the low resolution of the data obtained for the
pghs- xxxd2376xxx  complex does not allow for unrestricted refinement of the atomic positions, the protein
structure in the model of this complex is essentially identical
to the starting model save for the immediate vicinity of the
drug. the r-values indicate that the protein models derived
from the pghs- xxxd2141xxx  complex fit the  xxxd2376xxx  data reasonably well. these r-values are somewhat
higher than that obtained with iodosuprofen; this may reflect
the inability of the refinement algorithm to find low minima
when working with-low resolution data, or it may reflect
genuine differences between the protein structure in the
presence of  xxxd2141xxx  and in the presence of  xxxd2376xxx . it is also likely that the  xxxd2376xxx  did
not effect complete displacement of the  xxxd2141xxx  and that
the structure is heterogeneous in the cyclooxygenase active
site region, with some molecules containing  xxxd2376xxx  and others containing  xxxd2141xxx  and/or no bound
inhibitor. finally, since we can fit the light atoms of the
inhibitor into the active site in two orientations, we cannot
rule out the possibility of conformational heterogeneity within
the inhibitor.
iodosuprofen-pghs complex structure. iodosuprofen
binds to pghs at the top of the long cyclooxygenase channel
leading from the membrane binding surface to the cyclooxygenase active center (figure 5).  xxxd2141xxx  has already been found to bind in this site (picot et al., 1994), and
no significant differences are observed between the positions and orientations of active site side chains in the
 xxxd2141xxx  and iodosuprofen complex structures. this
comes as no surprise, given the strong similarity between
the two inhibitors.
the iodosuprofen is oriented with its carboxylate group
outermost; that is, it appears to have entered the narrow
channel thiophene ring first. side chains lining the channel
below the inhibitor, including tyr-355 and arg-120, close
around the inhibitor and render it inaccessible to solvent.
we calculate that greater than 98% of the surface area of
the inhibitor is buried in the complex. as is the case with
 xxxd2141xxx , the carboxylic acid moiety of iodosuprofen
forms a salt bridge with arg-120, the two carboxylate oxygen
atoms of the inhibitor lying 2.8 and 3.0 å, respectively, from
one of the guanidino nitrogens of the arginine (figure 2). in
addition, one carboxylic acid oxygen of iodosuprofen lies
2.9 å from the phenolic hydroxyl of tyr-355, evidently
forming a hydrogen bond. a hydrogen bond also appears
to be formed between the carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor’s
ketone moiety and the side chain hydroxyl of ser-530: the
two atoms are separated by 3.0 å and display a favorable
geometry for hydrogen bonding. these are the only polar
interactions the iodosuprofen molecule is observed to make
with pghs.
the basis of the enzyme’s stereoselectivity for the sstereoisomer of iodosuprofen is clear from the structure and

an fo - fc difference map calculated after rigid body refinement of the starting model (see experimental procedures) against the iodosuprofen
data. the final refined model is shown superimposed on the map. (a) the fit of the inhibitor to the density is illustrated, with a few protein
side chains included to orient the viewer. two electron density contour levels are displayed: the thin lines show the 3sigma contour while the
thick lines show the 14sigma contour. an fo(iodosuprofen) - fo( xxxd2141xxx ) difference map calculated with mir phases from the  xxxd2141xxx 
structure shows the same very strong density for the iodine atom, but no density for the light atoms, as is expected from the structural
similarities between  xxxd2141xxx  and iodosuprofen (not shown). the iodine atom of the inhibitor is seen at the center of the 14sigma density
peak. the carboxylate group of the inhibitor engages in a salt bridge with arg-120 and lies within hydrogen-bonding distance of the
hydroxyl of tyr-355. glu-524 is also engaged in a salt bridge interaction with arg-120. the iodothiophene moiety packs directly under
tyr-385. in this view, ser-530 lies behind the inhibitor; its side chain hydroxyl is positioned to make a hydrogen bond with the ketone
oxygen of the inhibitor. (b) stereoview of the bound inhibitor showing the protein backbone and side chains making up the active site

is the same as that proposed for (s)- xxxd2141xxx  (picot et
al., 1994). the r-methyl group of the inhibitor’s propionic
acid is tucked into a small hydrophobic cleft lined by leucine
and valine residues. the r-stereoisomer would place the
r-methyl not in this small pocket but in unfavorably close
contact with tyr-355 (see figure 2a). a recent study
(bhattacharyya et al., 1996) showed that the mutation of tyr355 to phenylalanine substantially reduces the enzyme’s
stereoselectivity toward 2-methyl-arylpropionic acid drugs.
the two aromatic rings of the inhibitor extend upward
from the  xxxd3029xxx  into the hydrophobic upper portion
of the cavity. the planar thienyl group is twisted with
respect to the phenyl ring, with a dihedral angle between

the phenyl ring and thecarbonyl group of 49°; a similar, albeit
less pronounced, torsion is seen in the crystal structure of
 xxxd3265xxx  (peeters et al., 1983). the phenyl ring makes van
der waals interactions with a number of hydrophobic side
chains lining the channel, including leucine, valine, and
alanine side chains. the thiophene ring makes similar but
less extensive interactions. the iodine atom of the inhibitor
lies in a small pocket at the top of the channel and is in
close contact with various hydrophobic side chains, including
the aromatic ring of tyr-385. in addition, the iodine lies
3.2 å away from the backbone carbonyl oxygen of leu384, a distance smaller than the sum of the van der waals
radii (nyburg & faerman, 1985). while this distance cannot

the same vantage point as figure 2b. shown is an fo - fc map calculated after rigid body refinement of the starting model (see experimental
procedures). identical 10sigma peaks corresponding to the two noncrystallographically related iodine molecules in the asymmetric unit were
observed. no other peaks higher than 3sigma were observed elsewhere in the map. a difference map (not shown) having coefficients of the
form fo( xxxd2376xxx ) - fo( xxxd2141xxx ) and using the mir phases from the  xxxd2141xxx  model was essentially identical to the map
seen here. (a) fo - fc map contoured at 6sigma. the refined position of the cis model of the  xxxd2376xxx  molecule is shown, as are parts

be considered extremely precise, given the resolution of the
structure, it suggests that the iodine and oxygen atoms may
be engaged in an interaction of the lewis acid-lewis base
type, such as has been seen in small molecule crystal
structures of iodine-containing organic compounds.
 xxxd2376xxx -pghs complex structure. as is the
case with iodosuprofen, the iodine atom of  xxxd2376xxx 
is observed to bind at the top of the cyclooxygenase channel,
packing directly against the aromatic ring of tyr-385 (see
figure 5). this is the same site that is occupied by the iodine
atom in the iodosuprofen structure; the distance between the
iodine positions in the two structures is 0.6 å. placement
of the iodine atom in the initial fo - fc map was
unambiguous (figure 3). density was also seen in this map
for the light atoms of the  xxxd2376xxx  molecule, but
the quality of the map did not allow these atoms to be
unambiguously fit into density. however, since the iodine

lies at the very top of a relatively narrow channel, the possible
orientations available to the remainder of the molecule are
in fact quite limited. in addition, there are only five
conformationally significant bonds in the inhibitor about
which free rotation should be possible, and so the conformational space available to the molecule is not large. hence,
by fixing the iodine position and by assuming that the protein
structure is the same as that found in the pghs- xxxd2141xxx 
complex, it was possible to manually build in the light atoms
of the  xxxd2376xxx  molecule, using the x-ray crystal
structure of the inhibitor as a guide (loll et al., 1995b).
steric constraints contributed by the protein side chains
lining the channel severely limited the positions that the
inhibitor atoms could occupy, and only two possible binding
modes were identified. these modes correspond to the cis
and trans conformers of the inhibitor, which are distinguished
by a 180° rotation about the amide bond (see figure 4).

349, leu-359, ala-527, and leu-531. both models predict
a salt bridge interaction between the inhibitor’s acetic acid
moiety and the side chain of arg-120, but these interactions
differ significantly between the two models. in the trans
model the acetic acid group is located between arg-120
and tyr-355 and could potentially participate in both a
charged pair interaction with arg-120 and in a hydrogen
bond with tyr-355. dual interactions such as these are
also seen with  xxxd2141xxx  (picot et al., 1994), iodosuprofen, and  xxxd3159xxx  (loll et al., 1995a) in their respective complexes with pghs. in contrast, in the cis model
only arg-120 makes an interaction with the inhibitor’s
carboxylate group, and tyr-355 appears to be able to form
a hydrogen bond with the ester oxygen of the inhibitor’s
methoxy group.

sulfide; 5 ) (z)-1-(p-chlorobenzylidene)-2-methyl-5-methoxyindenylacetic acid; 6 ) (e)-1-(p-chlorobenzylidene)-2-methyl-5methoxyindenylacetic acid. cis and trans conformers of  xxxd2376xxx  (2) are also shown.

models of the inhibitor in both of these binding modes were
constructed. both agreed well with the density in the fo fc map, utilized reasonable values for the torsion angles of
the inhibitor, and avoided serious steric clashes with the
protein. these models were then subjected to limited
refinement, which relieved unfavorable contacts and significantly improved the r-value without drastically changing the
position of either the inhibitor or any active site side chains.
the resulting models are chemically reasonable and agree
well with the diffraction data. given these facts and given
the powerful constraints imposed by the inhibitor’s position
at the end of the narrow channel, it appears likely that one
of the two models is correct. however, we cannot rigorously
rule out the possibility that other binding modes may exist
which we have failed to consider yet which are consistent
with the observed iodine position. hence, save for the iodine
position, which is experimentally well determined, these
models should be regarded as tentative.
in both our models for  xxxd2376xxx  binding, the
iodophenyl group of the inhibitor lies in a hydrophobic
pocket at the top of the channel, with the iodine occupying
the same position as that described for iodosuprofen above
(see figure 3). the carbonyl bridge between the phenyl and
indole rings is situated further down the channel below the
phenyl ring and is within 4 å of several potential hydrogen
bond donors, including the gamma-hydroxyl of ser-530. it is
possible to bring the ser-530 side chain into position to make
a hydrogen bond with this carbonyl by a series of small
torsion angle adjustments, indicating that the interaction is
a feasible one. the indole rings in the cis and trans models
overlap and are roughly coplanar; in both models the indole
is in contact with several aliphatic side chains, including val-

use of heavy-atom labeled inhibitors. crystallographic
studies of drug-protein interactions depend critically upon
the availability of well-diffracting crystals of the particular
drug-protein complexes. in cases where data are available
to very high resolution, the refinements are overdetermined
and it is possible to obtain extremely precise models of the
complex. however, for many important macromolecules,
the best available crystals diffract x-rays to considerably
more modest resolution. in such cases, the use of ligands
labeled with electron-dense heteroatoms has historically
proven immensely useful [see, for example, olsen et al.
(1976)]. once the structure of the protein is known, lowresolution structures of heavy-atom labeled drugs complexed
with the protein can be used in conjunction with modeling
techniques to provide information about the interactions
between the labeled compound and its protein target. while
this information cannot approach the precision afforded by
a high-resolution crystal structure determination, it should
be emphasized that the heavy atom can be located with high
accuracy. the heavy-atom reference point provides a
powerful constraint which, when taken in conjunction with
the steric constraints supplied by the active site pocket, limits
possible binding modes for the compound of interest to a
very small number.
modeling of  xxxd2376xxx  binding. we have identified two possible models of the pghs- xxxd2376xxx 
complex, starting from the experimentally determined iodine
position. on the basis of the diffraction data we cannot
discriminate between the cis and trans models; after refinement, their r-values and protein stereochemistry are of equal
quality. in addition, there is little to suggest that one
conformer is inherently more favorable than the other, since
both conformations are observed in small molecule crystal
structures (kistenmacher & marsh, 1972; loll et al., 1995b),
and molecular modeling calculations yield similar energies
for both conformers (loll, unpublished). we therefore
attempted to discriminate between the two models using other
criteria, including the models’ agreement with structureactivity data for indomethacin analogs and the geometry of
the important interaction between arg-120 and the drug’s
carboxylate group.
both models are in good agreement with the structureactivity profile of  xxxd3259xxx  (3), a drug isosteric with indomethacin (see figure 4).  xxxd3259xxx  is a prodrug which
contains a sulfoxide moiety in a position analogous to those

7338 biochemistry, vol. 35, no. 23, 1996
occupied by the halogens in indomethacin and  xxxd2376xxx . the drug is inactive as the sulfoxide but
becomes active upon metabolism to the sulfide 4 (shen,
1979). both of our models place the iodine atom of
 xxxd2376xxx  in a hydrophobic pocket directly under
tyr-385; we predict that the branched sulfoxide group of 3,
which is significantly larger and more polar than the iodine,
would not be accommodated in this space. on the other
hand, the less polar sulfide is only slightly larger than the
iodine and should be accommodated.
we next consider structure-activity data for 1-benzylidenyindene isomers 5 (also known as mk-715) and 6. the
z-isomer 5 is a five times more potent cyclooxygenase
inhibitor than the e-form 6 (hoogsteen & trenner, 1970).
this observation has been used to argue that the cis form of
indomethacin, which is isosteric with the (z)-indene, is the
bioactive conformation (gund & shen, 1977). however, a
5-fold difference in affinity is not large, considering the large
structural difference between 5 and 6.
in studies of arginine-carboxylate interactions in crystal
structures, clear preferences have been found for low (<45°)
guanidinium-carboxylate interplanar angles and for the
carboxylate oxygen accepting the hydrogen bond to lie in
the plane of the guanidinium (singh et al., 1987). in the cis
model, the guanidinium-carboxylate angle is roughly 35°,
and one of the carboxylate oxygens lies very close to the
guanidinium plane; in the trans model the guanidiniumcarboxylate angle is roughly 70°, and the oxygens both lie
far from the guanidinium plane. hence, geometrical arguments favor the cis model over the trans.
in conclusion, the relative affinities of 5 and 6 and the
superior geometry of the carboxylate-arginine salt bridge
in the cis model lead us to favor the cis model over the trans.
however, we cannot rule out the possibility that both the
cis and trans conformations of indomethacin bind pghs;
this would be consistent with the fact that 6 still inhibits the
enzyme quite efficiently, even though it is 5-fold less potent
than 5. heterogeneity of binding might also explain our
inability to grow well-ordered crystals of the pghsindomethacin and pghs- xxxd2376xxx  complexes.
thus, more experimental evidence will be required to
completely elucidate the details of how drugs like indomethacin and  xxxd3259xxx  inhibit pghs.
comparison of different modes of inhibitor binding. the
nsaids display an unusually large degree of structural
diversity. at least five structural classes of nsaids can be
identified, with compounds from different classes bearing
little or no resemblance to one another (mantri & witiak,
1994). this suggests the existence of distinct inhibitor
binding sites or subsites on the enzyme which are used by
the different inhibitor types. alternatively, these inhibitors
may employ different features of a common site for binding.
to date, structures have been reported for complexes of
pghs with inhibitors belonging to three distinct classes: the
salicylate 2-(bromoacetoxy) xxxd306xxx , an aspirin analog
(bromoaspirin; loll et al., 1995a),  xxxd2376xxx , an
arylacetic acid, and  xxxd2141xxx  and iodosuprofen, both
arylpropionic acids (picot et al., 1994). these compounds
differ widely in size and shape and inhibit pghs by both
covalent and noncovalent mechanisms. hence, it is interesting to note that despite their structural and mechanistic
differences, these inhibitors all share a common site of action
(figure 5).

various inhibitor binding sites. representation of the protein
backbone of an entire pghs monomer, viewed from the dimer
interface. this is viewed from essentially the same direction as in
figures 2b and 3. the helices comprising the membrane binding
domain are seen at the bottom of the figure, while the egf-like
domain is seen at the right. the heme is shown in red near the top
of the molecule. shown superimposed are the four inhibitors
 xxxd2141xxx  (blue), iodosuprofen (green), the cis model of  xxxd2376xxx  (red), and acetylated ser-530 and  xxxd3159xxx 
(yellow). it can be seen that there is substantial overlap between
the volumes occupied by the four inhibitors. four protein side chains
surrounding the inhibitors are shown: tyr-385 (purple; above the
inhibitor), tyr-355 (purple; below the inhibitor on the left), ser530 (cyan; above and to the right of the inhibitors), and arg-120
(cyan; below the inhibitor on the right). this figure was prepared
with the program molscript (kraulis, 1991).

the nsaids we have studied in complex with  xxxg1883xxx 
all bind at the top of the channel leading from the exterior
of the protein to the cyclooxygenase site, in close proximity
to the putative catalytic residue tyr-385. their binding
therefore blocks access of substrate to the active site cavity
that lies at the end of this channel. the blockage is achieved
in different ways by different compounds. for example, the
acetyl group introduced by bromoaspirin lies near the top
of the channel, just below tyr-385; it does not fill the channel
but evidently occupies enough volume to prevent the
substrate from contacting tyr-385. on the other hand,
 xxxd2141xxx , iodosuprofen, and  xxxd2376xxx  are substantially larger than this acetyl group and fill the entire
channel from tyr-385 downward a distance of roughly 1214 å. certain structural details are common to the binding
of the different compounds. the carboxylic acid moieties
of  xxxd2141xxx ,  xxxd3159xxx , iodosuprofen, and  xxxd2376xxx  all form salt bridges with arg-120, and at least
some appear to form hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl of tyr355. since many of the different classes of nsaids carry
carboxylic acid groups, these interactions may prove to be
general features of binding for these drugs. this observation
also suggests that the substrate  xxxd208xxx  may bind
with its carboxylic acid group making similar contacts with
arg-120 and tyr-355.
our observations also support the conclusion that a wide
variety of ligands could occupy the cyclooxygenase catalytic
pocket without obvious steric hindrance and without majorconformational change in the protein structure between

upon binding and subsequent dissociation. such a structural
change will surely involve conformational alterations of the
aperture residues and, perhaps, the membrane binding
domain. the magnitude of these conformational transitions
or whether they can be correlated to the binding efficiencies
of different nsaids is not known. crystallographic analysis
of the uninhibited holo- xxxg1883xxx  may shed some light on the
nature of these putative conformational changes. although
well-ordered crystals of uninhibited holo- xxxg1883xxx  are more
problematic to grow and handle, work toward this goal is
underway.

have observed for the nsaids also clearly show that the
nsaids occupy a site that is quite buried within the interior
of the protein. as suggested by loll et al. (1995a), several
residues, including tyr-355 and arg-120, create an aperture
or constriction between the channel mouth and the catalytic
pocket. space-filling models showing the mouth of the
cyclooxygenase channel (figure 6) reveal the extent to which
the protein surrounds both iodosuprofen and  xxxd2376xxx . the buried nature of the bound nsaids strongly
