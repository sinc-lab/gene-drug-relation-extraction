abstract. the pharmacologic profile of the novel b-adrenoceptor antagonist/vasodilator,
carvedilol, has been investigated in vitro. carvedilol produced competitive antagonism of
the b1-adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic response to  xxxd2401xxx  in guinea pig
atria, and the b2-adrenoceptor mediated relaxation to  xxxd2401xxx  in carbachol (1 mol/l)
precontracted guinea pig trachea, with a dissociation constant (kg) for b\-adrenoceptors of
0.8 nmol/l and b>-adrenoceptors of 1.3 nmol/l. at slightly higher concentrations, carvedilol
produced competitive inhibition of the o-adrenoceptor mediated contractile response to
norepinephrine in rabbit aorta with a kg of 11 nmol/l. carvedilol had no significant effect on
the contractile response to  xxxg99xxx  in rabbit aorta at concentrations up to 10 pmol/l,
thus demonstrating the lack of nonspecific vasodilator actions in arteries. in canine saphe-
nous vein, carvedilol produced noncompetitive blockade of a2-adrenoceptor mediated vaso-
constriction, indicative of some additional activity. in estrogen-primed rat uterus precon-
tracted by depolarization with kci (70 mmol/l), carvedilol produced concentration- xxxd2870xxx -
dent relaxation (icso of 7.6 pmol/l), consistent with the notion that carvedilol may be a
calcium channel antagonist. support for this hypothesis was obtained in kci (70 mmol/l)
depolarized rabbit aorta where carvedilol (10 pmol/l) produced a 10-fold parallel rightward
shift in the concentration-response curve to calcium chloride. these studies demonstrate
that carvedilol is a potent ,-, b2- and a -adrenoceptor antagonist, and a moderately potent
calcium channel antagonist. these multiple activities of carvedilol may contribute to the
antihypertensive activity of the compound.

ids, which are related to their primary phar-
macologic action (i.e., b-adrenoceptor block-
ade). other drawbacks with this class of
drugs are the relatively slow onset of antihy-
pertensive action and the sometimes limited
efficacy that results. one of the recent ad-
vances in the treatment of hypertension has
been the development of b-adrenoceptor an-
tagonists that possess additional pharmaco-
logic properties that enhance antihyperten-
sive efficacy and which may reduce mech-
anism-related side effects. for example,
 xxxd2435xxx  is a nonselective b-adrenoceptor
antagonist that is also a relatively selective
a -adrenoceptor antagonist [1, 2]. other
pharmacologic activities that have been
combined with b-adrenoceptor blockade to
achieve the same therapeutic goal are vaso-
dilator activity (e.g., prizidolol) [3, 4], and
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition
(e.g., bw a575c) [5].

carvedilol (fig. 1) is a novel antihyperten-
sive agent that possesses a combination of
b-adrenoceptor antagonist activity and pe-
ripheral vasodilator activity. carvedilol pro-
duces a reduction in blood pressure with lit-
tle or no reflex tachycardia in animals [6]
and humans [7, 8] and the onset of action
following oral administration is rapid. the
antihypertensive activity of carvedilol, in

contrast to other b-adrenoceptor antago-
nists, is accompanied by a reduction in total
peripheral vascular resistance, indicative of
peripheral arterial vasodilation [6-8; ni-
chols et al., unpubl. data]. the mechanism
by which carvedilol produces vasodilation,
however, is at present unclear. earlier stud-
ies in animals have suggested that carvedilol
is a ‘nonspecific’ arterial vasodilator [6, 9,
10], whereas more recent studies have sug-
gested that carvedilol is a potent and se-
lective a )-adrenoceptor antagonist [11, 12]
and possibly a calcium channel antagonist
[13]. the purpose of the present study is to
characterize, in both quantitative and quali-
tative terms, the various activities inherent
in carvedilol which may contribute to the
antihypertensive activity of the compound.

methods

general considerations

animals were sacrificed by a sharp blow to the
head (rats and guinea pigs) or by an overdose of
sodium pentobarbital (rabbits and dogs). tissues
were removed and dissected free of fat and connec-
tive tissue in an appropriate physiological buffer (see
below for composition). whole tissues, or rings or
strips prepared from them, were suspended in organ
baths containing the physiological buffer aerated
with 5% carbon dioxide/95% oxygen. the tissues

connected to either a beckman r611 dynograph, a
narco bio-systems physiograph mk-iv or a narco
bio-systems narcotrace 80 and allowed to equili-
brate under the appropriate resting tension (table 1)
for at least 2h before drug addition. for guinea pig
atrium and trachea, rabbit aorta and canine saphe-
nous vein, krebs-henseleit buffer was used with the
following composition (mmol/l): nacl, 118; kcl,
4.7; mgch, 0.54; cach, 2.5; nah2pos, 1.0;
nahcos, 25 and glucose, 11. high-potassium, cal-
cium-free krebs-henseleit buffer was prepared by
omitting the  xxxg2125xxx , increasing the concentration of
kci to 70 mmol/l and reducing the nacl to 53
mmol/l to maintain isotonicity. for rat uterus, ani-
mals were brought into estrous by pretreatment with
17-p-estradiol (1 mg/kg, s.c., 24 h prior to experimen-
tation). the inherent spontaneous contractile activity
of the rat uterus was reduced by using dejalon’s
solution of the following composition (mmol/l):
nacl, 154; kcl, 5.6; cach, 0.4, nahcos, 6 and glu-
cose, 2.7. high-potassium dejalon’s buffer was pre-
pared by increasing the kci to 70 mmol/l and reduc-
ing the nacl to 90 mmol/l. cocaine (6 pmol/l) and
edta (30 mol/l) were added to the krebs-hensel-
eit and dejalon’s buffers to block neuronal uptake
and to prevent the spontaneous oxidation of cate-
cholamines, respectively.

tissues

the ability of carvedilol to interact with a)-, a2-,
bi- and b>-adrenoceptors and to block extracellular
calcium influx was assessed in a variety of isolated
tissues using several different protocols. the tissues
used, and their preparation and experimental condi-
tions, are listed in table 1.

experimental procedures

the methods used to study the various pharmaco-
logic properties of carvedilol are outlined in table 2.
concentration-response curves in all tissues were con-
structed by the method of stepwise cumulative ad
tion of the agonist [14]. the concentration of the ago-
nist in the organ bath was increased approximately
3-fold at each step, with each successive addition
being made only after the response to the previous
administration had attained a maximum level and
remained steady. after completion of a concentra-
tion-response curve, drugs were washed from the
preparation at regular intervals by the overflow meth-
od. consecutive concentration-response curves on a
given tissue were separated by at least 2h to ensure
maximum washout of the agonist and to minimize the
possibility of receptor desensitization. for all tissues,
except the rat uterus, a control concentration-re-
sponse curve was first obtained for the agonist (ta-
ble 2) and following complete washout of the agonist
the tissue was incubated with carvedilol (1 nm/—
10 1m) for 60 min after which a second concentra-
tion-response curve was obtained in the presence of
carvedilol, in the rat uterus, a concentration-response
curve for the relaxant effects of carvedilol was ob-
tained after precontraction of the tissue with kci
(70 mm). in all experiments at least one representa-
tive tissue was run in parallel with the experimental
tissues but received no carvedilol, and was used to
correct for time-dependent changes in agonist sensi-
tivity [15].

 

determination of dissociation constants

the dissociation constants (ky) for carvedilol act-
ing as an antagonist at a- and b-adrenoceptors were
determined by the technique of arunlakshana and

schild [16]. dose-ratios produced by carvedilol (i.e.,
the ratio of the concentration of the agonist required
to produce a half-maximal response in the presence of
the antagonist divided by the control half-maximal
concentration) were determined for various concen-
trations of carvedilol. the logarithm of the (dose ratio
— 1) was plotted against the respective logarithm of
the concentration of carvedilol, which resulted in a
straight line, allowing the slope and intercept along
the abscissa to be determined. under equilibrium
conditions, the slope of the schild regression does not
differ significantly from unity if antagonism is com-
petitive, and the intercept along the abscissa is the
paz, which is equal to the negative logarithm of the
dissociation constant (i.e., -log kg). when the slope
of the schild regression was not significantly different
from unity, the data were fitted to a line with a slope
constrained to 1.0, and the value of the intercept
along the abscissa of this plot was used to determine
the pap [17, 18].

statistical evaluation

the results are expressed as the mean + sem of
n observations. the statistical significance of the dif-
ference between two means was determined by stu-

dent’s t test [19]. all straight lines were drawn by
linear regression [20] and tested, wherever possible,
for deviations from linearity by analysis of variance
in regression [19]. the slopes of the regression lines
were tested for significance by an f test [20].

drugs

all drugs were prepared as stock solutions (10
mmol/l) in appropriate solvents, and subsequent dilu-
tions were made in distilled water. solutions of carve-
dilol (boehringer-mannheim gmbh, frg) were pre-
pared by dissolving the free base in n,n-dimethyl-
formamide (dmf; final concentration, 10%) adding
a mole equivalent of 1 n hci and diluting to appro-
priate volume in distilled water. nifedipine (sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo.) was dissolved in 100%
ethanol.  xxxd2750xxx  and isoprotere-
nol+ hcl (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo.) were
dissolved in distilled water containing  xxxd228xxx 
(50mm). b-ht 920+2hci (synthesized at smith
kline and french laboratories, king of prussia,
pa.), carbachol chloride (sigma chemical co., st.
louis, mo.), (+)-propranolol-hcl (ayerst, new
york, n.y.),  xxxd2914xxx  mesylate (ciba-geigy
corp., ardsley, n.y.),  xxxd3000xxx  (pfizer, groton,
carvedilol in vitro

conn.), cocaine-hcl (merck, sharpe and dohme,
west point, pa.) and  xxxg99xxx  acetate (sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo.) were dissolved in dis-
tilled water.

results

the b-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of
carvedilol is shown in figure 2. it can be seen
that carvedilol inhibited the b|-adrenoceptor
mediated positive chronotropic response to
 xxxd2401xxx  in the guinea pig atrium and
produced parallel shifts in the  xxxd2401xxx 
concentration-response curve with no signif-
icant effect on the maximum positive chron-
otropic response (fig. 2a). analysis of the
data by the method of arunlakshana and
schild [1959] gave a schild regression with a
slope of 0.95 + 0.09, which was not signifi-
cantly different from the theoretical value of
unity. the schild regression with the slope
constrained to unity gave a pa> of 9.11 +
0.06, which yields a kg of 0.8 nmol/l.

carvedilol also antagonized the §2-adre-
noceptor mediated relaxation produced by
 xxxd2401xxx  in carbachol (2 1m) precon-
tracted guinea pig trachea. the antagonism
of  xxxd2401xxx  was competitive as evi-
denced by the parallel shifts in the isoproter-
enol concentration-response curve with no
significant reduction in the maximum re-
sponse (fig. 2b). the schild regression based
on these data had a slope of 0.85 + 0.08,
which was not significantly different from
unity. the schild regression with the slope
constrained to unity gave a pa» of 8.87 +
0.04 which yielded a kg of 1.3 nmol/l. these
data indicate that carvedilol is a potent, rel-
atively nonselective b-adrenoceptor antago-
nist.

phenous vein could result from nonspecific
vasodilator activity of carvedilol or from cal-
cium channel blockade since a-adrenocep-
tor mediated responses in this tissue are
invariably dependent upon the translocation
of extracellular calcium [23].

possible nonspecific effects of carvedilol
in arteries were studied by examining the
effect of carvedilol on the contractile re-
sponse to  xxxg99xxx  in rabbit aorta. pra-

zosin (100 nmol/l) was included in the buffer
in order to eliminate possible a;-adrenocep-
tor mediated effects of  xxxg99xxx  pro-
duced by the release of norepinephrine from
sympathetic nerves in the aorta. in contrast
to the effects at a|-adrenoceptors, carvedilol,
at concentrations up to 10 pmol/l, did not
inhibit the contractile response to angioten-
sin ii (fig. 5).

the ability of carvedilol to interact with
voltage-dependent calcium channels, as sug-
gested previously [13], was studied in the
estrogen-primed rat uterus and the rabbit aor-
ta. smooth muscle membrane depolarization
with k* (70 mmol/l) in the rat uterus pro-
duced a nifedipine-sensitive contractile re-
sponse which results from opening of calcium
channels associated with the cell membrane.
carvedilol produced a concentration- xxxd2870xxx -
dent relaxation of the depolarized rat uterus
with an icso of 7.65 + 0.62 mol/l (fig. 6a). in
rabbit aorta incubated in calcium-free buffer
containing  xxxd2914xxx  (1 pmol/l) to block
a-adrenoceptors, depolarization with kt (70
mmol/l) produced only a small contractile
response. addition of calcium to the buffer
produces a nifedipine-sensitive, concentra-
tion dependent contractile response. carvedi-
lol, at concentrations above | jsmol/i, signifi-
cantly inhibited the calcium-induced contrac-
tile response, with a 10-fold parallel rightward
displacement of the calcium concentration-
response curve being observed  xxxd1891xxx  mol/l]
(fig. 6b).

discussion

the in vitro pharmacologic profile of car-
vedilol has been studied in a variety of iso-
lated tissues in order to determine the possi-
ble mechanisms by which carvedilol lowers
334

nichols/sulpizio/ashton/hieble/ruffolo

 

blood pressure and produces vasodilation. it
is clear that carvedilol has a variety of ac-
tions at several sites. in accord with previous
studies [9], carvedilol is a potent, competi-
tive antagonist at both b- and b-adrenocep-
tors. however, the potency of carvedilol at
both b-adrenoceptor subtypes in this study
was 10- to 20-fold higher than that reported
previously which may result from differ-
ences in the assay conditions.

in addition to its antagonist activity at b-
adrenoceptors, carvedilol was found to be a
potent, competitive a|-adrenoceptor antago-
nist with an affinity for this receptor some
10- to 20-fold less than that observed at b-
and f2-adrenoceptors. this is in agreement
with the data of seki et al. [11] who demon-
strated a\-adrenoceptor blockade with car-
vedilol in blood vessels. examination of the
structure of carvedilol (fig. 1) reveals that
the molecule contains a phenoxyethylamine
moiety. phenoxyalkylamines form a general
class of a-adrenoceptor antagonists [24] and
many compounds that possess a phenoxy-
ethylamine moiety are potent a )-adrenocep-
tor antagonists, such as thymoxamine, phen-
oxybenzamine and wb-4101. both phen-
oxybenzamine and wb-4101 have chiral
centers in the phenoxyethylamine moiety,
and both compounds show stereoselectivity
with respect to their ability to interact with
a -adrenoceptors [25]. as such, it has been
established that the phenoxyethylamine
structure can indeed bind to a\-adrenocep-
tors, and we propose, therefore, that carvedi-
lol interacts with a,-adrenoceptors through
its phenoxyethylamine moiety.

we investigated the effects of carvedilol
at a2-adrenoceptors in the canine saphenous
vein in an attempt to uncover and character-
ize @-adrenoceptor effects of the compound.
because the antagonism of a2-adrenoceptor

mediated responses in canine saphenous
vein was not competitive, we conclude that
carvedilol is not an a-adrenoceptor antago-
nist. however, the noncompetitive blockade
of a -adrenoceptor mediated responses in
canine saphenous vein could result from
either nonspecific vasodilator activity or
from calcium channel blockade, the latter
being possible because a -adrenoceptor me-
diated vasoconstriction is solely dependent
upon the translocation of extracellular cal-
cium [26]. because carvedilol at high con-
centrations did not antagonize the vasocon-
strictor response to  xxxg99xxx , we con-
clude that the likelihood that carvedilol is a
nonspecific vasodilator is low. as such, stud-
ies were performed to assess the calcium
channel blocking activity of carvedilol in
vitro.

the calcium channel blocking properties
of carvedilol were investigated in the rabbit
aorta and rat uterus. our data clearly show
that carvedilol does indeed have the capacity
to block voltage-operated calcium channels
in that the k* depolarized rat uterus could be
completely relaxed in a concentration-de-
pendent manner by carvedilol. furthermore,
the calcium-dependent vasoconstrictor re-
sponse in k* depolarized rabbit aorta was
also inhibited in a concentration-dependent
manner by carvedilol. the concentrations of
carvedilol that are required for this effect are
higher than those required to produce block-
ade of a)- and \-adrenoceptors, and thus
carvedilol must be considered to be only a
moderately potent calcium channel blocker.
however, we have confirmed in vivo that
carvedilol does block calcium channels at a
dose which represents a submaximal antihy-
pertensive dose of the compound [nichols et
al., unpubl. data]. it is interesting to note
that the phenylalkylamine calcium channel
carvedilol in vitro

antagonist, verapamil, can also block a,-
adrenoceptors, and in this regard, the notion
that a compound, such as carvedilol, can
block both a\-adrenoceptors and calcium
channels is not unknown.

the results of the present study indicate
that carvedilol is a potent, bj-, b2- and a)-
adrenoceptor antagonist. in addition, carve-
dilol is also a moderately potent antagonist
of voltage-operated calcium channels. a)-
adrenoceptor blockade and calcium channel
blockade can both produce vasodilation and
thus, both mechanisms could possibly con-
tribute to the reduction in total peripheral
vascular resistance observed with carvedilol.
to what extent the various pharmacologic
activities of carvedilol contribute to the
overall antihypertensive and vasodilatory re-
sponse is unknown. it is known, however,
that alone, either nonselective a-adrenocep-
tor blockade, a)-adrenoceptor blockade or
calcium channel blockade can produce re-
ductions in blood pressure, and that a com-
bination of any or all of these activities could
result in enhanced antihypertensive activity
for carvedilol. the possibility exists, there-
fore, that the antihypertensive activity of
carvedilol is mediated by a variety of mech-
anisms in vascular smooth muscle.
