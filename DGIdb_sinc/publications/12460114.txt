abstract—the biogenic amines  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, and putrescine are essential factors of cell growth and differentiation.
to inhibit pyridoxal5′phosphate dependent  xxxg1626xxx  and pyruvate dependent s xxxd3156xxx  decar
boxylase, key enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis, a system of substratelike osubstituted hydroxylamines is suggested. the
best of these compounds were active at nanomolar concentrations. high potency and specificity of this type of inhibitors are
discussed in terms of structural similarity of e–i and e–s complexes.
key words: polyamines,  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, osubstituted hydroxylamines, s xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase,
 xxxg1626xxx 

the polyamines  xxxd3234xxx  (spm) and spermidine
(spd) as well as their precursor putrescine (put) are found
in significant amounts in eukaryotic and prokaryotic
cells, in plants, and in viruses. polyamines are essential
factors of cell growth and differentiation, while tumor
cells have elevated levels of polyamines as compared to
normal cells.
polyamines exist at physiological ph as polycations,
and they efficiently interact with dna, rna, and nucle
oproteins, including ribosomes [1]. polyamines are native
regulators of the activities of topoisomerases and restric
tases as well as enzymes of dna and rna biosynthesis.
spermidine, being the one donor of the aminobutyl frag
ment in the deoxyhypusine synthase reaction, is essential
for posttranslational modification of the epsilonamino group
of a lys residue, located in a highly conservative region of
the polypeptide chain, of initiation factor eif4a, which
is present in all eukaryotes. transformation of lys into
hypusine [nepsilon(4amino2hydroxybutyl)llysine] is
crucial for the activity of eif4a [2]. polyamines are
involved in the regulation of mitochondrial ca2+ trans
port [3], serve as modulators of nmda receptor [4] and
as effectors of k+ transport [5]. recently, it was demon
strated that polyamines participate in apoptosis [68].
the totality of different known cellular functions of
polyamines makes it possible to consider spm and spd as
universal low molecular weight regulators of cellular
metabolism. the decrease in intracellular polyamine
content results in inhibition of cell growth or even cell
death.

polyamine metabolism is tightly related to transfor
mations of ornithine, methionine, and sadenosylme
thionine ( xxxd3156xxx ). key enzymes of polyamine biosyn
thesis are pyridoxal5′phosphate (plp) dependent
 xxxg1626xxx  (odc) and pyruvatedependent
s xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ),
while  xxxd3234xxx /spermidinen1acetyltransferase (ssat)
is the key enzyme of polyamine catabolism (fig. 1).
these key enzymes are shortliving proteins (halflife in
cells is about 30 min). both biosynthesis and degradation
of all three of them are easily induced. polyamine metab
olism is selfregulated. cells are equipped with a system
of active polyamine transport and this system makes an
important contribution to intracellular polyamine con
tent and regulation of their metabolism.
specific regulation of polyamine metabolism is a
rather complicated task. however, this approach is wide
ly used to investigate cellular functions of polyamines.
specific inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis and the
compounds able to activate the enzymes of polyamine
catabolism, as well as inhibitors of polyamine transport,
have a wide spectrum of biological activities [912] that
give practical importance to the investigation of
polyamine metabolism and cellular functions.
the step of ornithine and  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylation
involves the formation of a schiff base between plp or
pyruvate and a substrate amino acid. respectively, it was
quite obvious to use carbonyl reagents (derivatives of
hydrazine, hydroxylamine,  xxxd3392xxx , etc.) to inhib
it these enzymes. objectively, alphahydrazinoornithine

effectively (ic50 0.52.0 µm) inhibited odc, but the ease
of oxidation of hydrazinogroup decreased the value of
this compound for cell experiments [13, 14].
phenyhydrazine was found to be an irreversible inhibitor
of  xxxg152xxx  (ic50 0.5 mm) and the corresponding
phenylhydrazone was identified [15].  xxxd415xxx  (gamma
aminooxyalphaamino butyric acid) and aminooxyacetic
acid turned to be not very active inhibitors (ic50 1
0.1 mm) of odc [16] and  xxxg152xxx  [17], respectively.
so, application of simple carbonyl reagents could not
obey the required specificity and effectiveness of the inhi
bition of odc and  xxxg152xxx .
however, in the case of plpdependent decarboxy
lases of his [18] and glu [19], as well as for gaba
transaminase [20], the efficiency of inhibition of their
enzymes by different osubstituted hydroxylamines
depended on the structure of the alkyl substituent.
structural similarity between amino acid sidechain and
alkyl fragment of osubstituted hydroxylamine was pos
tulated to be important for effective inhibition of these
plpdependent enzymes.
respectively, for specific and irreversible inhibition
of  xxxg152xxx  a family of earlier unknown sulfonium
containing osubstituted hydroxylamines, which may be
considered as analogs of decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx 
(deadomet) and methylmethionine, were designed and
synthesized [21]. a key compound of this family was s
(5′deoxy5′adenosyl)[(methylthio)ethyl]hydroxyl
amine—ama (fig. 2) [22].
ama is an analog of deadomet, in which a methyl
ene group, connected with the amino group, is substitut
ed onto the oxygen atom, i.e., the aminomethylene group
is converted into an aminooxy group, which was the driv
ing force of irreversible inhibition. such a substitution is
isosteric and the similarity of the inhibitor with the sub
strate as well as specificity of ama binding with the
enzyme active center are not changed greatly, which is
crucial for specificity of inhibition. the aminooxy group
has pka ~ 5.0, which is about five orders of magnitude
lower than the pka of the amino group of deadomet.
biochemistry (moscow) vol. 67 no. 10

thus, at physiological ph ama is monocation, which
may be essential for the transportation of the analog into
the cell.
as depicted in table 1, the effectiveness of inhibition
was determined by the chemical structure of the inhibitor
and the most effective compound (ama) was isosteric
with the product of enzymatic reaction—deadomet. the
lack of the sulfonium center and adenosine group, these
probably being the main fragments responsible for the
recognition, immediately decreased the activity of the
inhibitor by about five orders of magnitude (compare
compound (i) and ama, compound (ii) and ama).
nonprotonated h2nogroup formed the stable oxime
with the pyruvate residue in the active center of
 xxxg152xxx . inhibition was irreversible and developed in
time. substrate was incapable of restoring the activity of

the enzyme, but it competed with ama for binding with
the enzyme active center.
ama inhibited plpdependent odc and aspartate
aminotransferase only in µm and mm concentrations,
respectively, that confirmed the specificity of the inhibitor
towards  xxxg152xxx .
when synthesized, ama turned out to be the first
specific and highly effective irreversible inhibitor of
 xxxg152xxx , acting in nm concentrations, which is 1000
times better than the best of the inhibitors known before.
the activity of most eukaryotic  xxxg152xxx  is
allosterically regulated by putrescine. the mechanism of
this activation apparently includes putrescineinduced
conformational changed of the protein structure, that
results in 10fold decrease in km of the substrate
(0.06 mm at ph 7.5), in changes in the ph profile of
enzymatic reaction, and also in decrease in kcat to 2.5 sec–1
at 37°c [24]. on the contrary, bacteria, including e. coli,
have mg2+dependent  xxxg152xxx . it was documented,
that mg2+ is essential for effective inhibition of  xxxd3156xxx 
by ama. in the absence of mg2+, ama was inactive even

at 5.9 µm concentration (ic50 for the enzyme from e. coli
was 0.002 µm, see above). similar decrease in the activi
ty in the absence of mg2+ was observed also in the case of
3aminooxy1aminopropane (apa), which was a non
specific irreversible inhibitor of  xxxg152xxx . this may
mean that mg2+ causes conformational changes in the
enzyme structure and catalytically important pyruvate
residue become available and reactive towards amino
group of the substrate as well as towards the aminooxy
residue of ama [25].
the second type of hydroxylamine containing
inhibitors of  xxxg152xxx  (fig. 3) include 5′deoxy5′
[n(gammaaminooxypropylamino)]adenosine (vi) [26], 5′
deoxy5′[nmethyln(betaaminooxyethylamino)]
adenosine (maoea), and 5′deoxy5′[nmethyln(gamma
aminooxypropylamino)]adenosine (maopa) [27].
the inhibitory activity of maoea towards
 xxxg152xxx  from prostate was for about 100 times weak
er than ama did in the case of rat liver enzyme (compare
tables 2 and 1). the activities of (vi), maopa, and
maoea were within the same order of magnitude. in all
cases inhibition was irreversible and developed in time.
substrate was incapable of restoring the activity of
 xxxg152xxx , but it competed with all inhibitors for bind
ing with enzyme active center.
the peculiarities of the interaction of de xxxd3156xxx 
and deaza xxxd3156xxx  with  xxxg152xxx  may explain
observed differences in activities of ama and maoae.
both de xxxd3156xxx  and deaza xxxd3156xxx  were competitive
inhibitors of  xxxg152xxx . however, only de xxxd3156xxx 
formed a schiff base with  xxxg152xxx , which can be
reduced by nabh3cn [28]. an interesting property of
 xxxg152xxx  is timedependent inactivation of the
enzyme as the result of the incubation with substrate,
product, or alphamethyl xxxd3156xxx  [28]. this was interpret
ed in terms of transamination of the enzyme and subse
quent addition of cys140 (enzyme from e. coli) to
acrolein system [2931] (fig. 4). however, neither aza
 xxxd3156xxx  nor deaza xxxd3156xxx  were capable of inhibiting

the enzyme irreversibly [28]. finally, nitrogen atom of
aza xxxd3156xxx  has abnormally low pka = 7.09 and the
compound was able to substitute effectively for  xxxd3156xxx ,
which is a corepressor of methionine repressor (metj)
e. coli, only at ph 5.5, while at ph 7.4 the analog was
not recognized as  xxxd3156xxx  [32]. so, it might be possible
to assume that methylamino groups of maoea and
maopa will also have low pka and these compounds
may be considered as analogs of decarboxylated s
 xxxd3157xxx , but not of decarboxylated
 xxxd3156xxx . probably, only xray investigation of the cor
responding e–i complexes will give an exact picture of
the interaction of ama and maoea with the active cite
of  xxxg152xxx .
the second key enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis is
plpdependent odc, which is the most investigated
enzyme of polyamine metabolism. many different
inhibitors of odc are known, including suicide alpha,alpha
difluoromethyl ornithine ( xxxd1972xxx ), which was synthe

2002

sized in 1978 [33] and at present it is still one of the main
and definitely most detailed investigated inhibitor of
odc both in vitro and in vivo [34].
however, like the case of  xxxg152xxx , among sub
strate, or more exactly, among putrescinelike osubsti
tuted hydroxylamines it was possible to find effective and
specific inhibitors of odc (fig. 5). the first, simplest,
and one of most active compound of this series was 3
aminooxy1aminopropane (apa) [35]. inhibition activ
ity of apa, as well as the activities of a number of it
analogs, are given in table 3.
apa is an isosteric analog of put but the introduc
tion of h2nogroup into put converted the latter into a
carbonyl reagent. the positively charged amino group of
apa plays anchoring functions and ensures proper bind
ing of the inhibitor at the odc active center. the
aminooxy group (pka ~ 5) of apa is unprotonated at
physiological ph and responsible for formation of oxime
with plp in the enzyme active center. inhibition of

odc did not develop in time, probably due to the acti
vation of carbonyl group of plp as the result of forma
tion of internal aldimine with epsilonamino group of lys.
ornithine did not protect the enzyme from apa, and
the activity of the inhibited odc could not be restored
upon addition of excess of the substrate. however, it was
possible to obtain catalytically active enzyme after gel
filtration of e–i complex (elution buffer contained
plp). this observation was in a good agreement with
the reversible character of plp binding with apoenzyme
(the affinity of plp to apoenzyme is about 0.10.3 µm).
the aminooxy analog of cadaverine (aba) was 10fold
less active as compared with apa. bisaminooxy deriv
atives (viiix), which are nonprotonated at physiolog
ical ph, did not exhibit any inhibitory effect even at

1 µm concentration. specificity of action of apa was
confirmed by low activity of the compound (ic50 about
0.1 mm) towards plpdependent ornithine transami
nase and  xxxg152xxx .
introduction of a hydroxyl group into the apa mol
ecule (2ohapa) had practically no effect on the
inhibitory potency of the analog; moreover, the activities
of corresponding r and sisomers of 2ohapa were
very similar (table 3). on the contrary with apa, 2oh
apa, and aba, which were pseudo irreversible inhibitors
of odc (excess of the coenzyme was able to revert the
inhibition), 2fapa was an irreversible inhibitor of
odc [37]. it is reasonable to assume that at the first
stage 2fapa formed an oxime of odc, while irre
versible inhibition may come out either from alkylation

of the essential for catalysis cys360, or due to stabiliza
tion of e–i complex by additional strong hydrogen
bond, which is quite typical for a fluorine atom.
unfortunately, the exact reasons for irreversible inhibi
tion of odc by 2fapa were not investigated in paper
[37].

to conclude this section, it is necessary to remark
that apa may be considered not only as a putrescinelike
carbonyl reagent and respectively as an effective inhibitor
of odc, but also as a charge insufficient (h2nogroup
has pka ~ 5) putrescine analog. since biological functions
of polyamines are determined by superposition of both
molecule structure and charge, an original set (fig. 6) of
charge insufficient aminooxy analogs of spd [38] and
spm [39] were synthesized. these compounds turned out
to be useful tools to investigate polyamine biochemistry.
aminooxy analogs of spd and spm turned out to be effec
tors of the enzymes of polyamine catabolism [41], they
were found capable to penetrate inside cells and specifi
cally inhibited the growth of tumor cells, exhibited low
cytotoxicity, and regulated catabolic stability [4245].
a general feature of all highly effective and specific
hydroxylaminecontaining inhibitors of  xxxg152xxx  and
odc (see present paper), as well as gludc [19], hisdc
[18],  xxxg8xxx  [20], and gammacystathionase [46]
was the presence of properly positioned functional groups
in alkyl fragment, that secured structural similarity with a
substrate or with a product of the enzymatic reaction.
these functional groups showed high affinity of the
inhibitor to the enzyme active center at reverse stage,
while aminooxy group formed an oxime with plp or car
 xxxd2700xxx containing prosthetic group responsible for cataly
sis. such an oxime of the enzymes may be considered as a
mimetic of external aldimine—an intermediate com
pound common for all types of plpdependent transfor
mations of amino acids. however, the above semiempir
ic considerations require description in terms of structur

al similarity of e–i and e–s complexes. since the cor
rectness of this consideration may serve as a background
of the algorithm for conversion of amino acid into its
antagonist, a comparative xray investigation of com
plexes of aspartate aminotransferase (aspat) with alpha
methylaspartate and  xxxd439xxx  was performed.
it turned out that in the complex of aminooxyacetic
acid with mitochondrial aspat (closed conformation),
the hoocgroup of  xxxd439xxx  formed a hydro
genbonded ion pair with arg292 in a manner very simi
lar to that of the betahoocgroup of alphamethylaspartate
and in both cases arg292, in its turn, formed a salt bridge
with asp15 (figs. 7a and 7b). unlike the aspat aldimine
with alphamethylaspartate, the oxime of the enzyme with
 xxxd439xxx  lacks alphahoocgroup. in the case
of alphamethylaspartate this alphahoocgroup interacted
with arg386 of small domain (fig. 7a). however, in
aspat oxime the place of alphahoocgroup was occupied
with a water molecule, which was hydrogen bonded with
the same arg386 (fig. 7b). keeping in mind that forma
tion of the oxime of mitochondrial aspat with
 xxxd439xxx  in closed crystal form produced only
insignificant changes in cofactor orientation and confor
mation in the active site, as compared with corresponding
complex formed by alphametylaspartate (figs. 7a and 7b), it
may be possible to consider structural similarity of e–i
and e–s complexes to be confirmed and such an oxime
of the enzyme does mimic corresponding external
aldimine of the enzymatic reaction [47].
an important stage of the present study was the inves
tigation of the interaction of hydroxylaminecontaining
inhibitors of  xxxg152xxx  and odc–ama and apa,
respectively–with cells. both inhibitors were able to pene
trate inside different cell types and to inhibit polyamine
biosynthesis. cell growth was reduced upon addition of
polyamines in the media and this confirmed the specifici
ty of the action of the inhibitors [4851]. with the help of
apa and ama it was possible to confirm the key role of
spd in supporting growth and viability of cells [50, 51]; to
demonstrate directly that  xxxg152xxx  is synthesized as a
proenzyme [52]; to investigate some peculiarities of the
transport of polyamines and their analogs in cells [53]; to
reveal that tumor cells with depleted polyamine poll are
more sensitive to 5fura and methotrexate [51].
hence, from the result of the investigation of new
possibilities of specific inhibition of  xxxg152xxx  and
odc, key enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis, by sub
stratelike osubstituted hydroxylamines, it became pos
sible to begin with an earlier unknown chemical com
pound that turned out to be an effective inhibitor of the
enzyme, and to continue with specific regulation of cellu
lar metabolism and growth.

polyamine metabolism were supported by the russian
