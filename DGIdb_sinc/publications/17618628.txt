abstract somatic  xxxg99xxx -converting enzyme (s-ace)
plays a central role in blood pressure regulation and has been
the target of most antihypertensive drugs. a displacement isothermal titration calorimetry method has been used to accurately
determine the binding constant of three strong s-ace inhibitors.
under the experimental conditions studied in this work, the relative potency of the inhibitors was determined to be enalaprilat > lisinopril > captopril. we analyze the thermodynamic
behaviour of the binding process using the new structural information provided by the ace structures, as well as the conformational changes that occur upon binding.

1. introduction
during the mid-1950s the role of  xxxg99xxx -converting
enzyme (ace; ec.3.4.15.1) in the regulation of blood pressure
stimulated the interest of its study due to the use of ace inhibitors as antihypertensive agents [1]. captopril was the ﬁrst orally active antihypertensive inhibitor to be developed and was
among the earliest successes of the revolutionary concept of
structure-based drug design [2]. many highly potent ace
inhibitors such as enalaprilat, lisinopril, ramipril,  xxxd3063xxx ,
perindopril and benazepril have subsequently been developed
over the last two decades [3,4]. that all of them are among
the most used drugs for the hypertension treatment and provide an example of successful drug design in silico. as ace
structures have only become recently available, these drugs
were designed using the active site of other zinc dependent
dipeptidyl carboxypeptidases of known structure. however,
the target of these drugs, the somatic ace (s-ace), has been
proved to be a complex enzyme with two homologous catalytic
domains arising from gene duplication [5]. despite the two

domains, called n- and c-domain, sharing approximately
60% sequence identity, they have distinctive physicochemical
and functional properties. another shorter ace, the testis
ace (t-ace), has been reported to be tissue-speciﬁc. this
ace form shares higher homology with the c-domain of
s-ace. the crystal structure of the human t-ace has been
determined as the unbound form and as a complex with lisinopril [6], captopril and enalaprilat [7]. in addition, the structures of the n-domain of human s-ace in the presence and
absence of lisinopril have become available [8]. the analyses
of these structures reveal that the three inhibitors directly
interact with the catalytic zn2+ ion in the active site of the
enzyme through the thiol group of captopril and the carboxylate groups of enalaprilat and lisinopril. these results show that
both domains are potential binding sites for the substrate and
inhibitors. however, recent results support a stoichiometry of
only 1 mol of inhibitor per mol of monomer of s-ace [9,10].
these results and the evidence of conformational changes
in the structure of the homologous angiotensin-converting
enzyme-2 ( xxxg37xxx ) [11] reveal that the enzymatic mechanism
of s-ace is a complex process and that the interactions
between the n- and c-domain cannot be ruled out. additionally, the role played by the chloride ions in the regulation of
the enzyme activity is a subject of increasing interest [12].
a better knowledge of the interaction at molecular level of
ace inhibitors will help in the design of new drugs for high
blood pressure treatment. isothermal titration calorimetry
(itc) has been widely used to obtain thermodynamic information related to the binding process in biological macromolecules [13]. it has been proposed to be an important tool in
understanding the correlation between structure and thermodynamic parameters [14]. however, the determination of the
thermodynamic parameters that drive the binding of these
inhibitors to ace is limited by the high value of their binding
constants [15]. in order to estimate the binding constant from a
titration experiment the ratio between the binding constant
and the protein concentration must be in 1–1000 range, preferably between 10 and 100 [16]. thus, any direct measurement of
these large binding constants requires very low protein concentrations, which is translated into a heat signal close to the
detection limit. sigurskjold [17] described a displacement
method that can be applied to the determination of large binding constants. the method requires a competitive inhibitor
with a known binding constant. in the present study, the determination of the binding constant of the weak ace inhibitor
l -aspartyl-l -phenylalanine (l -asp-l -phe) to s-ace by means
of itc is reported. using the method developed by sigurskjold, we have determined the binding constant of the strong
inhibitors lisinopril, captopril and enalaprilat to s-ace from

pig lung. the results have been analyzed taking into account
the new structural information provided by the recent ace
structures. these analysis provide an explanation of the observed thermodynamic behaviour, which consists of an entropically driven binding process.

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
 xxxd2620xxx -sepharose and epoxy activated sepharose 6b were
purchased from amersham biosciences. hepes and cacodylate were
purchased from sigma. enalaprilat was generously provided from
merck. all other chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained locally.
lisinopril was coupled to epoxy activated sepharose 6b as described
elsewhere [18]. s-ace was puriﬁed from pig lungs using a two-step
aﬃnity chromatography with  xxxd2620xxx -sepharose followed by
lisinopril sepharose 6b as described previously [18]. s-ace concentrations were determined using a molar absorption coeﬃcient of
2.2 · 105 m1 cm1 at 280 nm [18].

m. andújar-sánchez et al. / febs letters 581 (2007) 3449–3454
direct itc titrations were made to determine binding enthalpy and
binding constants for l -asp-l -phe. binding constants for the strong
inhibitors, captopril, lisinopril and enalaprilat, were measured by the
displacement method proposed by sigurskjold [17]. brieﬂy, for each
displacement experiment a solution of s-ace was ﬁrst titrated until
saturation with the weak inhibitor l -asp-l -phe. then, the injection
syringe was cleaned and reﬁlled with a solution of the strong inhibitor
to perform a second titration. the results of these experiments were
analyzed according to the method proposed by sigurskjold with an
origin function ﬁle kindly provided by this author.
2.4. accessible surface areas
accessible surface areas (asa) were calculated with the program
naccess [19] by using a 1.4 å probe radius and 0.05 å slice width.
calculated values of heat capacity changes (dcp,cal) were derived
according to spolar and record [20]:
dc p;cal ¼ ð1:34  dasanp þ  ð0:59  dasap þ j=k mol

where dasanp and dasap are the respective changes in water-accessible non-polar (np) and polar (p) surface area in å2. asa changes
upon the binding of the inhibitor were calculated using the equation:
dasa ¼ asaace-inh  ðasaace þ asainh þ å

2.2. enzyme activity assay
s-ace activity was assayed using 2-furanacryloyl-l -phenylalanylglycylglycine (fapgg) as substrate as described previously [18].
brieﬂy, the protein was buﬀered at ph 7.5 with 50 mm hepes,
0.3 m nacl and 10 lm  xxxd3556xxx . seven hundred and seventy microliters
of buﬀer were mixed with 200 ll of 0.5 mm fapgg. the reaction
was initiated by adding 30 ll of enzyme solution containing 1–3 lg
of protein to a cuvette thermostatted previously at 25 c. the absorbance decrease at 334 nm was monitored for two minutes and the initial velocities were determined. one unit of activity is deﬁned as the
amount of s-ace that produces a da334/min of 1.0. puriﬁed sace has an activity of 35–37 u/mg. activity assays at a constant
inhibitor concentration and varying substrate concentrations were
done in order to determine the inhibition constant.
2.3. isothermal titration calorimetry
itc experiments were performed using a mcs microcalorimeter
from microcal inc. (northampton, ma, usa). this instrument has
been described in detail by wiseman et al. [16]. the reference cell
was ﬁlled with water, and the instrument was calibrated using standard
electrical pulses. a circulating water bath was used to stabilize the temperature. the instrument was allowed to equilibrate overnight. all
solutions were thoroughly degassed by stirring under vacuum before
use. solutions of s-ace were titrated with 10 identical 10 ll injections
at 6 min-intervals. the injection syringe, on which a paddle is
mounted, stirred the solutions at 300 rpm, ensuring immediate mixing.
concentrations of the protein used for the titrations were in the range
of 3.5–16.4 lm, while concentrations of the inhibitors were 0.6–3.0
mm (l -asp-l -phe) and 0.2–0.5 mm (lisinopril, captopril and enalaprilat). all the experiments in this study were conducted at a nacl concentration of 300 mm and in at least two diﬀerent buﬀers. dilution
experiments were performed by identical injections of s-ace inhibitor
into the cell containing only buﬀer. the peaks of the thermograms
were integrated and the heat produced by the binding reaction was calculated as the diﬀerence between the reaction heat and the corresponding dilution heat. the resulting binding isotherms were analysed by
non-linear least-squares ﬁttings to a model corresponding to a single
set of identical sites, according to the equation:

3.1. binding of l -asp-l -phe to s-ace
with the aim of comparing the value of the binding constant
obtained by means of itc measurements, activity assays at
constant inhibitor concentration and varying substrate concentrations were conducted in order to determine the inhibition
constant of l -asp-l -phe for the pig lung s-ace. assuming
competitive inhibition:

obtained by plotting km versus [l -asp-l -phe] and the aﬃnity
constant determined by activity assays was 1.1 · 104 m1.
fig. 1 shows a representative titration of s-ace with l -aspl -phe. experimental data were ﬁtted to eq. (1) and only one
site per s-ace molecule was obtained. titrations in two diﬀerent buﬀers, hepes and cacodylate, were conducted to determine the number of protons exchanged during the binding
process. the number of protons released in the titration of
l -asp-l -phe at ph 7 is 0.7. itc titration experiments were
carried out at temperatures in the range of 15–25 c to determine the dcp value. table 1 shows the values of the thermodynamic parameters obtained from the analysis of the data.
3.2. binding constants of lisinopril, captopril and enalaprilat
determined by displacement measurement
fig. 2 shows the binding isotherm corresponding to the titration of s-ace saturated with l -asp-l -phe with a solution of
enalaprilat at ph 7 and 16 c. similar experiments were carried out using captopril and lisinopril. the results are shown
in table 2. it can be seen that as temperature raise, dg
becomes more negative and consequently k increases according to the endothermic nature of the binding process. at
ph 7 and the range of the studied temperatures, the relative

potency of the three inhibitors is enalaprilat > lisinopril > captopril. the binding isotherm was analyzed taking into account
a single type of sites and the resulting stoichiometry was 1 mol
of inhibitor by mol of s-ace monomer.
entropy changes for the binding of captopril, lisinopril, and
enalaprilat to s-ace were determined from the equation
dg = dh  tds and are collected in table 2. the thermodynamic analysis of the change of entropy due to the binding
process proposed by spolar and record [20] has been applied
to discriminate between rigid body associations and those
involving coupled conformational changes. brieﬂy, for protein

4. discussion
the binding constants of three strong inhibitors of s-ace
have been determined by a thermodynamic technique using
the displacement method proposed by sigurskjold [17]. it is
based in the binding of a relatively weak ligand and the subsequent displacement by a higher aﬃnity competitive ligand.
several years ago l -asp-l -phe, a metabolite of aspartame,
was reported to inhibit s-ace [22] with a ki constant of
11 lm for the enzyme partially puriﬁed from rabbit lung
[23]. in our case the protein has been fully puriﬁed from pig
lung and we have checked the inhibitor constant by enzymatic
measurement obtaining a ki value of 89 lm under the same
experimental conditions than those reported by grobelny
and galardy [22]. the aﬃnity constant obtained by means of
itc at 25 c has a value of 9.2 · 103 ± 0.4 · 103 m1 which
agrees, within the error, with the value of the corresponding
constant obtained by enzymatic measurements. in the range
of temperatures studied here, the binding of l -asp-l -phe to
s-ace is endothermic and the enthalpy decreases at higher
temperatures, while the binding constant is much less aﬀected

by temperature changes as a consequence of an enthalpy–entropy compensation. this behaviour is commonly observed
in ligand–protein interactions [24]. although s-ace has two
potential binding sites for the substrate/inhibitor, only one site
by enzyme monomer was obtained. this result agrees with
those previously reported for the study of the binding of captopril, enalaprilat and lisinopril to s-ace [9] and also with
those reported by binevski et al. [10]. moreover, skirgello
et al. [25] reveal by means of enzymatic measurements that
the kinetic analysis of the simultaneous hydrolysis of two substrates by s-ace demonstrated a competition of these substrates for binding to the s-ace molecule and, as
consequence, the binding of a substrate at a unique active site
makes the other one unavailable for either the same or a diﬀerent substrate.
the thermodynamic determinations of the inhibition constant of the three potent inhibitors captopril, enalaprilat and
lisinopril show that enalaprilat is the strongest inhibitor with
an aﬃnity constant of 6.2 · 108 m1 whilst the weakest one,
captopril, has an aﬃnity constant one order of magnitude
smaller, 7.5 · 107 m1. several authors have reported diﬀerent
aﬃnity and selectivity to the n- and c-domains of s-ace
[26–28] for its inhibitors. wei et al. [15] show that at a concentration of 300 mm nacl the relative potency of the three
inhibitors for the c-domain of s-ace was lisinopril (4.2 · 109
m1) > enalaprilat (1.6 · 109 m1) > captopril (7.1 · 108 m1)
and for the n-domain captopril (1.1 · 109 m1) > enalaprilat
(3.8 · 108 m1) > lisinopril (2.3 · 108 m1). however, for the
whole s-ace, the relative potency for lisinopril, enalaprilat
and captopril have similar values to those reported for the
c-domain, with constant values of 2.6 · 109, 1.53 · 109 and
7.69 · 108 m1, respectively. these values were obtained by
enzymatic measurements at 37 c and ph 8.3 and they are
one order of magnitude higher than the value obtained by
means of the displacement method using itc. due to the

m. andújar-sánchez et al. / febs letters 581 (2007) 3449–3454

endothermic nature of the binding, it is expected that the binding constant will become higher as the temperature increases.
in addition, the itc experiments were carried out at ph 7
and a ph dependence has been reported for the enzymatic
activity of s-ace due to several ionizable groups present in
the active site [29]. moreover, the nature of the interactions
established at the binding site for the inhibitors enalaprilat
and lisinopril is very similar but not identical. both inhibitors
interact with the zinc atom in the active site through the carboxyl group with a pka value near to 3 [30]. besides, lisinopril
contains a lysine which has a pka value about 7 and interacts
with the subsite s 01 and could be responsible of the observed
changes in the aﬃnity constant as the ph increase. in this
way, the lysine moiety of the lisinopril is interacting with
glu162 in the c-domain (human t-ace structure) and this
interaction must be weaker as the lysine becomes unprotonated at ph values above 7. a diﬀerent picture could be drawn
for the n-domain where glu162 is replaced by asp140, but the
longer distance between this residue and the lysil group makes
this interaction weaker and may contribute to the lower aﬃnity of this domain for lisinopril.
the enthalpy values measured by the displacement method
of sigurskjold [17] are similar to those reported previously
by direct itc titrations for the three inhibitors [9]. as discussed previously, the three inhibitors show almost the same
positive enthalpy change upon binding and enthalpically
favorable interactions could play a role in the speciﬁcity of
the binding process. their contribution to the energy of binding is overcome by the hydrophobic contribution. a large contribution of entropy is indicative of such hydrophobic eﬀect.
moreover, to discriminate between rigid body associations
and those involving coupled conformational changes we used
the spolar and record approach [20] to analyze the entropy
change. when any conformational changes take place dsother
becomes negative (values are given in table 2), as it happens
for the three studied inhibitors. this means that conformational changes can not be ruled out. the  xxxg37xxx  structure, a
homolog of ace, has been solved in two diﬀerent conformations [31]. a hinge mechanism was proposed to switch from
the open-unligated  xxxg37xxx  to the close-ligated  xxxg37xxx  and,
based on modeling studies, it has been suggested to play an
important role in s-ace as well [32]. the closing of the active
site would result in the association of numerous residues that
would otherwise be bound to ordered solvent molecules when
the protein is in an open conformation.
the large dcp,assoc obtained experimentally indicate that the
binding of the inhibitors to s-ace is not a rigid body binding.
thus, heat capacity changes can be estimated on the basis of
x-ray structures using also the spolar and record approach
[33]. the structure of the whole s-ace has not been described
yet, however the structures of c-domain (human t-ace) are
available as unbound and complexed with the three strong
inhibitors (enalaprilat, lisinopril and captopril). since only
one mol of inhibitor is bound by one mol of s-ace, we used
the structure of the c-domain bound to the three inhibitors
structure to calculate the changes of polar and non-polar
asa upon binding. in the case of a rigid body binding the contribution of the n-domain to the change in non-polar and polar asa can be considered constant. the comparisons between
the experimental and calculated changes of the heat capacities
values (table 3) show a wide divergence for the three inhibitors. these discrepancies can be attributed to conformational

changes. moreover, the large negative heat capacity indicates
a decreased exposure of hydrophobic surface, such as it occurs
in the burial of surface within a protein interface. this conformational change can account for the strong negative cooperativity between the two sites which result in the binding to a
single site [9,10].
the crystallographic structures of c-domain (t-ace) and
n-domain of s-ace show the presence of chloride ions bound
to the enzyme. in the case of c-domain two sites have been reported: chloride i and chloride ii, respectively. although chloride ii site is placed near the active site, no direct interactions
between the chloride atom and the inhibitors are observed. the
chloride ii site is also observed in the n-domain structure but
not the chloride i site. ace activity has been reported to be
dependent on the chloride concentration and the n-domain
is activated at lower concentration and to a lesser extent than
the c-domain [26]. itc experiments were performed at high
chloride concentration where full activation of the s-ace
takes place. the dependence on chloride concentration has
been also reported for the  xxxg37xxx  enzymatic activity [11], but
in this case only the chloride i site is occupied and the a-helices
surrounding this chloride site shows a signiﬁcant displacement
upon inhibitor binding. in the n-domain of s-ace, arg500 is
bound to both the chloride ion and glu389, which is coordinating the zinc atom in the active site, and upon inhibitor binding the distance between arg500 and glu389 is reduced from
4.4 å to 3.5 å (fig. 3). therefore, upon inhibitor binding,
ace structures show some changes at the chloride sites that
might play an important role in the ace activation.
the chloride concentration dependence of the enzymatic
activity of the c- and n-domain, together with the weaker
binding inhibitor constant found for the captopril, allow us
to propose that the inhibitors in this study bind to the c-domain of s-ace. this observation also agrees with the fact that
kcat determined for s-ace is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
one determined for t-ace, suggesting that c-domain is the
principal angiotensin-converting domain [34]. furthermore,
the expression of modiﬁed ace domains cndom-ace and
ccdom-ace [35] show negative cooperativity between the
n and c-domain in both s-ace and cndom-ace, but the
ccdom-ace resulted in either additive catalytic activity or
positive cooperativity. consequently, a negative regulatory effect on catalytic activity of two-domain enzymes is proposed
for the n-domain. moreover, in order to allow interdomain
cooperativity, a ﬂexible interdomain bridge that permits close

unbound (blue, pdb code 2c6f) and lisinopril bound human n-ace

contact between the two domains is required. unfortunately,
no structure of the complete s-ace is available and there is
no information relating to how the conformational changes
are transferred between the n- and c-domains. a better
knowledge of thermodynamic parameters of the binding process of ace inhibitors and how these conformational changes
take place could help in the rational design of new and more
eﬀective drugs for the treatment of hypertension.
