the histamine h,-receptor antagonist,  xxxd2744xxx  ( xxxd2744xxx ), was tested for its
effect on the intestinal smooth muscle. isolated segments of guinea pig ileum were used in
tyrode solution at 37 °c.  xxxd2744xxx  (from 3.2 xx 10~® to 3.2 x 1074 m) caused a
concentration-dependent contractile response by the guinea pig ileum. the average maxi-
mum response to  xxxd2744xxx  (3.2 x 1074 m) was about 89% of the average maximum re-
sponse to  xxxd2940xxx  (3.2 x 10-6 m). the contractile responses induced by  xxxd2744xxx  were not
modified by  xxxd3050xxx  (10-8 and 10-7 m). on the other hand, atropine (10~® and 3.2 x
10-8 m) significantly prevented, while  xxxd2940xxx  (10~® and 3.2 x 1078 m) significantly en-
hanced the  xxxd2744xxx -induced responses in a concentration-dependent manner. these find-
ings suggest that  xxxd2744xxx  exerts an excitatory effect on the guinea pig ileum which seems
to be associated with the cholinergic system, probably through a direct and/or an indirect
mechanism (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and/or increased release of acetylcholine).

introduction

 xxxd2744xxx  ( xxxd2744xxx ) is a new potent hista-
mine h,-receptor antagonist. this agent (fig. 1)
is an analogue of other potent histamine h,-
receptor antagonists with ring side chains of
ranitidine and the thiazole ring of tiotidine (ici
125 211). the latter drug has been removed
from further testing following reports of malig-
nant lesions in rats with chronic use.1:?) nizati-
dine has been reported to have a potency similar
to that of ranitidine in reducing gastric acid pro-
duction.*®” it has also been shown in previous
studies that ranitidine elicits a marked excitatory
effect on different parts of the gastrointestinal
tract from several species.*~! the present study
was designed to examine the effect of  xxxd2744xxx 
on the intestinal smooth muscle.

— hartly strain albino guinea pigs of either sex
(weighing 400 to 500 g) were killed by a blow
on the head and exsanguinated. ileal segments (3
cm long) were taken 15 to 30 cm from the
ileocecal junction. the segments were suspended
in 15 ml organ baths, containing tyrode solution
which was bubbled constantly with a mixture
of 95% o.-5% co, gas and maintained at 37
°c. the composition (mmol/l) of the tyrode so-
lution was: nacl, 136.90; kcl, 2.68;  xxxg2125xxx ,,
1.80; mgcl, 1.05; nahcos, 11.90; nah,po,,
0.42 and glucose, 5.55. the ileal preparations
were loaded (500 mg) and allowed to be stabi-
lized for a period of 30 min before any com-
pound was added. during this period, the prepa-
rations were washed with fresh tyrode solution
every 10 min. the isotonic muscle responses of
the preparations were recorded by means of
isotonic myograph transducers (narco co.,
u.s.a.) and a physiograph (desk model type
dmp-4a, narco co., u's.a,).

drugs —— the following compounds were
used:  xxxd2940xxx  sulfate (calbiochem-behring,
u.s.a.),  xxxd2744xxx  ( xxxd2744xxx , eli lilly,
u.s.a.),  xxxd3050xxx  maleate (sigma chem. co.,
us.a.) and  xxxd247xxx  (chropee, greece).
the solutions of these compounds were freshly
prepared, before each experiment, using tyrode
solution as a solvent.

construction of concentration - response
curves — after the 30 min stabilization period,
the preparations were exposed to cumulatively
increasing concentrations of  xxxd2940xxx  (from 1078
to 3.2 x 107® m) and  xxxd2744xxx  (from 10~§ to
10-3 m) to obtain full concentration response
curves.

in another series of experiments the prepara-
tions were exposed to cumulatively increasing
concentrations of  xxxd2744xxx  (from 10~® to 3.2 x
10-4 m) and then were exposed to  xxxd2744xxx  3
min after pretreatment with  xxxd3050xxx  (10-8
and 10-7 m), atropine (1078 and 3.2 x 1078 m)
or  xxxd2940xxx  (1078 and 3.2 x 1078 m). the contact
time of each cumulatively increasing concentra-
tion of the above compounds with the prepara-
tions was 2 min.

statistical analysis —-the results were ex-
pressed as a percentage of the maximum re-
sponse induced by the control and the other re-
sponses were calculated as a percentage of the

cantly prevented the  xxxd2744xxx -induced re-
sponses in a concentration-dependent manner.
this prevention produced a right-ward shift of
the concentration-response curve for  xxxd2744xxx 
with marked depression of the maximum rfe-
sponse (fig. 4). on the other hand  xxxd2940xxx  (at
concentrations of 10-8 and 3.2 x 10~® m) signifi-
cantly enhanced the  xxxd2744xxx  produced con-
tractile responses (fig. 5).

discussion

smooth muscle can be stimulated by direct or
indirect activation of various excitatory recep-
tors. in our investigation it was shown that the
new histamine h,-receptor antagonist  xxxd2744xxx 
exerts a concentration-dependent excitatory
effect on the smooth muscle of the guinea pig
ileum. this effect is similar to that of the hista-
mine h,-receptor antagonist ranitidine on dif-
ferent parts of the gastrointestinal tract from
several species.4~! it is worth mentioning here

values of  xxxd2744xxx  augmentation caused by ese-
rine (p< 0.05).

that in a previous investigation concerning
isolated segments of guinea pig ileum under the
same experimental conditions, it was found that
the ranitidine maximum response (at the con-
centration of 3.2 x 1074+ m) was about 90%
against  xxxd2940xxx  (at the concentration of 3.2 x
10-® m),!® while in the present study it was
found that the  xxxd2744xxx  maximum response (at
the concentration of 3.2 x 10-4 m) was about
89% against  xxxd2940xxx . these data indicate that the
maximum activity of  xxxd2744xxx  is similar to that
of ranitidine and both of them resemble  xxxd2940xxx 
in their activity but ina weaker manner.

it is generally accepted that receptors mediat-
ing the histamine induced stimulating effect on
the guinea pig ileum are of the h, type.!” in this
study it was found that  xxxd3050xxx , an h,-
receptor antagonist, did not modify the re-
sponses of the guinea pig ileum caused by nizati-
672

dine. these results rule out the possibility that
 xxxd2744xxx  may be stimulating the h,-receptors.
on the other hand atropine, an antimuscarinic
agent, significantly prevented the responses
caused by  xxxd2744xxx , in a concentration- xxxd2870xxx -
dent manner. this prevention of  xxxd2744xxx 
caused by atropine is similar to that of ranitidine
as it was noticed in previous studies performed
by us and other workers.>:°°! these data sug-
gest that  xxxd2744xxx , like ranitidine, could be
acting through a cholinergic mechanism.  xxxd2940xxx ,
an anticholinesterase agent, significantly en-
hanced the  xxxd2744xxx -induced excitatory effect,
in a concentration-dependent manner, by in-
hibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase
enzyme. thus a greater availability of acetylcho-
line at the receptor sites produced enhancement
of the guinea pig ileum responses.

the conclusion which may be drawn is that
 xxxd2744xxx  exerts an excitatory effect on the
guinea pig ileum which seems to be associated
with the cholinergic system, probably through a
direct and/or indirect mechanism (inhibition of
acetylcholinesterase and/or increased release of
acetylcholine).
