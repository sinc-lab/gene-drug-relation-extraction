egfr inhibitors

emerging role of  xxxg682xxx 
inhibition in therapy for advanced malignancy: focus
on nsclc
corey j. langer, m.d.

combination chemotherapy regimens have emerged as the standard approach in advanced non–small-cell lung
cancer. meta-analyses have demonstrated a 2-month increase in median survival after platinum-based therapy
vs. best supportive care, and an absolute 10% improvement in the 1-year survival rate. just as importantly,
cytotoxic therapy has produced benefits in symptom control and quality of life. newer agents, including the
taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan, have expanded our therapeutic options in the treatment of
advanced non–small-cell lung cancer. despite their contributions, we have reached a therapeutic plateau, with
response rates seldom exceeding 30 – 40% in cooperative group studies and 1-year survival rates stable between
30% and 40%. it is doubtful that substituting one agent for another in various combinations will lead to any
further improvement in these rates. the thrust of current research has focused on targeted therapy, and
 xxxg682xxx  inhibition is one of the most promising clinical strategies. epidermal growth
factor receptor inhibitors currently under investigation include the small molecules gefitinib (iressa,  xxxd2186xxx )
and  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva, osi-774), as well as monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab ( xxxd467xxx , erbitux).
agents that have only begun to undergo clinical evaluation include  xxxd421xxx , an irreversible pan- xxxg682xxx  tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, and pki166 and  xxxd2445xxx , both examples of dual kinase inhibitors (inhibiting epidermal
growth factor receptor and her2). preclinical models have demonstrated synergy for all these agents in
combination with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy, leading to great enthusiasm regarding their ultimate
contribution to lung cancer therapy. however, serious clinical challenges persist. these include the identification
of the optimal dose(s); the proper integration of these agents into popular, established cytotoxic regimens; and
the selection of the optimal setting(s) in which to test these compounds. both gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx  have shown
clinical activity in pretreated, advanced non–small-cell lung cancer, but placebo-controlled randomized phase iii
studies evaluating gefitinib in combination with standard cytotoxic therapy, to our chagrin, have failed to
demonstrate a survival advantage compared with chemotherapy alone. © 2004 elsevier inc.

although it is the third most common cause of cancer in north
america, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer
death, responsible for more than one-fourth of all cancer mortality (1, 2). in addition, lung cancer is a growing public health
dilemma worldwide. most patients continue to present with
advanced stage disease. using conventional cytotoxic agents,
we have reached a therapeutic plateau in our treatment of
advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (nsclc). response
rates with conventional combination chemotherapy range between 25% and 40%. the median survival time in eastern
cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status
(ps) 0-1 patients is typically 8 –10 months, and the 1-year
survival rates are generally 30 – 40% (3–15). these results
have been influenced to a large extent by the proportion of
stage iiib patients enrolled in treatment protocols.

each of the new agents currently in widespread use in the
treatment of advanced nsclc (taxanes, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and irinotecan) appears to be as active as, if not
more active than, single-agent cisplatin (4 –7). in combination with cisplatin, several of these agents have demonstrated therapeutic superiority to cisplatin alone (8, 9). however, the combinations of each new agent plus a platinating
compound are virtually indistinguishable from each other
with respect to the response rate, time to progression, and
survival (8 –15). as a result, the focus of current research is
on novel, targeted therapies and their careful integration into
the standard therapy paradigm. in this regard, targeted
agents offer clinical investigators a unique opportunity to
improve the outcome in nsclc.
a partial list of new agents and their mechanisms of
action is included in table 1. unlike the biologic response
modifiers of the past, such as recombinant interleukin-2 and

interferon-␣, the newer targeted, “biologic,” agents are, in
general, considerably less toxic. their mechanism of action
is believed to be cytostatic, although evidence is emerging
of cytotoxicity in certain instances. preclinical models have
demonstrated synergy with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (rt) for many of these compounds. as research
progresses, multiple questions need to be answered regarding the appropriate use of each of these agents:
1. does a biologically rational way exist to integrate standard chemotherapy and newer targeted therapies?

volume 58, number 3, 2004

2. are toxicities of either modality exacerbated by their
combination?
3. do clinically significant additive, synergistic, or antagonistic pharmacologic or pharmacodynamic interactions
exist?
4. what are the best end-points to demonstrate clinical
benefit?
phase i studies for the newer targeted agents, for example, are clearly evolving and using unique end points compared with similar studies of cytotoxic chemotherapy. although all phase i studies must demonstrate safety, it is now
recognized that in the investigation of targeted therapies,
escalation of the dose to a maximal tolerated dose may not
be necessary and that a lower threshold dose may exist for
an optimal biologic effect. unlike phase i studies of dnadamaging agents, phase i studies of biologic therapies have
increasingly focused on clinically relevant molecular and
biochemical end points; these “surrogate” targets may generate helpful clinical “leads” that may inform dose finding
and appropriate clinical venues for subsequent clinical trials.
phase ii studies have generally assessed targeted therapies alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy
drugs and regimens, searching for possible additive or synergistic effects, both with respect to toxicity, as well as
therapeutic outcome. because advanced nsclc is a common entity with relatively rapid accrual, the newer agents
have been assessed almost exclusively in the advanced
disease setting. survival remains the primary end point in
virtually all these studies, and, despite recent advances, the
“time horizon” to primary outcome remains relatively short.
a disturbing trend has occurred for some investigators of
newer targeted therapies to leapfrog from phase i testing
straight to phase iii protocols without conducting appropriate phase ii studies (16, 17). in addition, many of these
agents have been combined empirically with cytotoxic
agents, without appropriate phase i or phase ii studies to
identify potentially harmful or antagonistic pharmacokinetic
or pharmacodynamic interactions or unanticipated toxicities
that might have emerged during traditional phase i-ii programs. also, many recent phase iii studies have been initiated without full knowledge of the optimal biologic dose
or optimal duration of therapy with a targeted therapeutic
agent. the rationale for this accelerated drug development
approach has been that integration of targeted therapy with
conventional cytotoxic agents offers the greatest potential
therapeutic benefit and takes advantage of synergistic interactions observed preclinically. in addition, proponents of
this accelerated approach have argued that the toxicities and
mechanisms of action for most targeted agents do not usually overlap those of conventional cytotoxic agents, allowing one to use full doses of both modalities. finally, in this
setting, maintenance therapy or consolidation after chemotherapy can often be tested without worrying about exacerbating previous chemotoxicity.

emerging role of egfr inhibition in nsclc

 xxxg682xxx  as
a potential target
of all the potential targets in adult solid tumors, the
 xxxg682xxx  (egfr) has been the most
extensively studied. the egfr is a transmembrane protein
involved in signaling pathways key to cell survival. it is
overexpressed in 40 – 80% of nsclc, as well as in a
number of other common solid tumors. its expression is
greatest in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and head
and neck (18). increased expression is clearly associated
with aggressive tumor growth and an inferior prognosis in
all human malignancies, including breast, cervical, and thoracic cancer (19) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck (scchn). egfr expression is also associated
with resistance to chemotherapy and rt and increased
metastatic potential. to exploit egfr as a therapeutic target, two basic approaches have been explored. one of these
has used monoclonal antibodies directed either at the receptor itself or its ligand (egf, transforming growth factor-␣),
acting in an extracellular manner inhibiting receptor engagement and activation. the second approach has focused
on small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors that act intracellularly and interfere with the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  itself,
blocking receptor autophosphorylation. the net result of
both approaches is inactivation of the egfr pathway and
inhibition of cell proliferation, neoangiogenesis, motility,
invasion, and metastasis.
antibody approaches have several potential advantages,
including a prolonged half-life, allowing a decreased frequency of drug administration; the potential for direct tumor
cell cytotoxicity via complement and antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms; receptor downregulation (permanent or temporary disappearance of the receptor from the cancer cell surface); and a favorable toxicity
profile (especially the virtual absence of gi toxicity). in
contrast, small molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors may
yield potentially better tumor penetration; oral administration is convenient for many patients even if it is daily; and
these agents often have a rapid onset of action, as well as
potential broad-spectrum effects against homologous tyrosine kinases, which may extend their therapeutic utility.
many of the egfr-targeted therapies in clinical development are listed in table 2. of these, gefitinib (iressa,
 xxxd2186xxx ),  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva, osi-774), and cetuximab
( xxxd467xxx , erbitux) have been the most extensively studied
to date.

small molecule egfr  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors
 xxxd2029xxx  (osi-774, tarceva)
 xxxd2029xxx  (osi-774 or tarceva) is an egfr-specific  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor. it belongs to the chemical class of
quinazolines. it is orally bioavailable and selectively inhibits the intracellular component of the receptor (20).  xxxd2029xxx 
has antitumor activity in multiple tumor xenograft models,

blocking critical cell processes controlling cell proliferation,
apoptosis, neoangiogenesis, and metastasis.
the most common clinical toxicities of  xxxd2029xxx  include
a grade 1-2 pustular rash, characterized by an erythematous
scaly base and generally concentrated on the face and upper
torso. its extent and severity appear to be dose related. the
rash often improves with continued treatment, will usually
diminish or even resolve with temporary cessation of therapy, and may respond to a variety of topical therapies,
including erythromycin ointment, as well as oral tetracycline antibiotics. diarrhea is another relatively frequent side
effect of  xxxd2029xxx . similar to the rash, it appears to be
dose-dependent and is generally mild to moderate (grade 1
or 2), nonbloody, and nonmucoid. diarrheal episodes usually start within the first few weeks of treatment, but rarely
escalate with continued therapy. conventional supportive
interventions (e.g., loperamide) are usually sufficient to
control it.
in a phase ii trial in patients with ecog ps 0 –2, platinum-exposed, egfr-positive, advanced nsclc,  xxxd2029xxx 
demonstrated significant antitumor activity (19). fifty-six
patients were evaluated. the median age was 62 years
(range 31–79); 44 (79%) had received two or more prior
regimens. at a dose of 150 mg/d orally, toxicity was generally mild. the most common side effects included acneiform rash in 78% and mild diarrhea (grade 2 or less) in
61%. grade 3 diarrhea occurred in only 1.8%. nine patients
demonstrated partial remissions lasting ⱖ8 weeks; of these,
7 had received two or more prior regimens. in 6 patients, the
response lasted at least 12 weeks. an additional 20 patients
had stable disease. the tumor response tended to correlate
with the development of rash, and responses were confined
to those with 2⫹ or 3⫹ egfr expression. the median
survival in this clinical study was 8 months, and the 1-year
survival rate was 48% in a group of patients with extensive
prior treatment. the manufacturer of  xxxd2029xxx  (genentech)
has recently completed two separate placebo-controlled,
randomized phase iii trials assessing commonly used cytotoxic regimens (either  xxxd2824xxx carboplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin) with or without  xxxd2029xxx , with survival as the
primary end point. enrollment in these trials was restricted
to patients with treatment-naive advanced nsclc and

ecog ps 0 –1, with randomization stratified on the basis of
stage, weight loss, and measurable vs. evaluated disease.
each study accrued ⬎1000 patients. a separate, randomized
phase iii trial in the third-line setting, largely conducted in
canada, compared  xxxd2029xxx  with placebo. this effort recently completed accrual. another placebo-controlled randomized phase iii effort in patients with ecog ps 2,
treatment-naive nsclc will compare vinorelbine with vinorelbine plus  xxxd2029xxx . in addition, a randomized phase iii

dose was not reached at ⬎750 mg/d (26). skin rash was
observed in 58% of patients, diarrhea in 44%, and nausea
and vomiting in 25%. a confirmed partial response was
noted in at least 1 patient with nsclc and 2 additional
nsclc patients had confirmed minor responses (27). in a
third trial (28), using an intermittent schedule (gefitinib
administered daily for 14 days every month), 1 of 11 patients with nsclc experienced a confirmed partial response lasting ⬎30 months. overall, nearly one-third of
nsclc patients treated in phase i studies of gefitinib had
sustained stable disease or better for ⱖ3 months (29).

gefitinib (iressa,  xxxd2186xxx )
like  xxxd2029xxx , gefitinib (iressa or  xxxd2186xxx ) is a small
molecule oral egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor and also
belongs to the chemical class of quinazolines. in a549
xenograft models, gefitinib has demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of tumor growth (21). preclinical studies in
vitro in lung cancer cell lines have revealed gefitinib to be
a potent selective inhibitor of egfr  xxxg2198xxx  at
concentrations that generally do not affect other tyrosine
kinases (22–24). sirotnak and others (25) (fig. 1) have
shown synergy for gefitinib with a spectrum of conventional
cytotoxic agents, including paclitaxel in lx-1 lung and
pc-3 prostate xenografts (25).
in phase i studies that included a relatively high percentage of patients with nsclc (many having received second-, third-, and even fourth-line treatment), gefitinib demonstrated clinical activity, including stabilization of disease,
occasional objective responses, and frequent improvement
in disease-related symptoms (26 –29). in one study, doselimiting toxicity, generally diarrhea, was observed at 700
mg/d (26). of 16 nsclc patients enrolled in that study, 2
had a partial response and 2 had minor responses. in a
separate phase i study, performed in the united states,
australia, and the united kingdom, the maximal tolerated

randomized single-agent phase ii trials with gefitinib
on behalf of the iressa dose evaluation in advanced
lung cancer (ideal 2) collaborators, kris and colleagues
(30) presented the final results of a phase ii effort in
advanced nsclc patients, whose tumors had progressed
after both platinum- and docetaxel-based therapy. patients
were randomized in double-blind fashion to either 250 mg/d
or 500 mg/d gefitinib. a total of 216 patients were enrolled.
the median age was 61 years, 57% were male, and 19%
were ecog ps 2. all were required to have systemic or
other disease-related symptoms. of the enrolled patients,
59% had tumors that had progressed after three or more
prior regimens. the response rate for the 102 patients receiving the low-dose (250 mg) regimen was 11.8%; for the
114 receiving the high-dose (500 mg) regimen, it was 8.8%.
in the low-dose arm, 42.8% of patients were free of progression at 2 months, and 35.5% in the high-dose arm
remained free of progression at ⱖ3 months. the symptom
response rates were virtually identical at 43% and 35% for
each dose level. the median survival was 6.1 months for the
low-dose arm and 6 months for the high-dose arm. the
high-dose arm resulted in significantly more grade 1 and 2
diarrhea and skin rash; grade 3 and 4 drug-related toxicities

occurred in 7% of the low-dose arm compared with 17.5%
of the high-dose arm.
the ideal 2 study confirmed the observations from the
phase i trials, in which egfr inhibition resulted not just in
a cytostatic effect (disease stability) in advanced nsclc,
but also in a cytotoxic effect (confirmed responses). this
trial also demonstrated that higher doses of gefitinib were
more toxic, but no more efficacious. in a companion analysis, natale et al. (31) reported that symptomatic improvement occurred in 95% of patients with an objective response
and in 71% with stable disease; improvements in quality of
life (functional assessment of cancer therapy-lung) occurred in 80% and 52% of the patients in these two groups.
the median survival for those with symptomatic response
was 12.8 months compared with 4.8 months for those without a symptomatic response, providing a clear linkage between symptom response and survival. it should be noted
that the eligibility for this study required a score of ⱕ24 on
the lung cancer subscale (treatment outcome index) of the
functional assessment of cancer therapy-lung questionnaire; asymptomatic patients were not allowed in this trial.
in addition, other intriguing observations were made. the
response rate in women was 19% compared with only 3% in
men. those with histologic findings of adenocarcinoma had
a response rate of 13% compared with only 4% for those
with histologic findings of nonadenocarcinoma. the response rate did not differ according to the performance
status or number of prior regimens.
the safety profile of gefitinib did not change with chronic
dosing beyond 6 months. the 250-mg daily dose was
 xxxd102xxx  tolerated than the 500-mg daily dose; those
receiving the lower dose required fewer dose interruptions
or dose reductions and had considerably less rash and diarrhea. clinical antitumor activity (i.e., response, progressionfree survival, and overall survival) was comparable for the
two gefitinib doses.
in a similar study (ideal 1), fukuoka et al. (32) evaluated the efficacy of gefitinib in non-u.s. patients who had
received one or two prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced nsclc. unlike the u.s. trial, patients enrolled in
this effort were not as heavily pretreated; 56% had failed
only one prior regimen compared with none in the u.s. trial.
the same double-blind phase ii randomization was used
with patients receiving either 250 or 500 mg/d gefitinib; 208
patients were assessable. patient age ranged from 28 to 85
years of age; 13% had ecog ps 2. as in the north
american trial, no difference was found in the response rate,

progression-free survival, or overall survival between the
two arms (table 3).
similar to the north american trial, the high-dose arm
proved more toxic, producing 30.2% grade 3 or worse
toxicity compared with only 8.7% in the low-dose arm.
treatment withdrawals were more common in the high-dose
arm: 29.4% vs. 9.9%. the median survival of patients
enrolled in the japanese/european study was considerably
better than that observed in the u.s. study. however, these
patients had received considerably less prior treatment (table 4), confirming that the extent of prior therapy had a
direct bearing on outcome and reinforcing the importance of
uniform entry criteria in clinical trials in advanced nsclc.
douillard and colleagues (33) examined the disease-related symptoms and quality of life in ideal 1. as in
ideal 2, two questionnaires were used: the functional
assessment of cancer therapy-lung and the treatment outcome index, a disease-specific seven-item lung cancer subscale. a total of 140 patients were assessable for symptom
improvement and compliance. a prospectively defined improvement in disease-related symptoms was observed in
40% and 37% of patients receiving 250 and 500 mg/d,
respectively. symptom relief was rapid, with a median time
to improvement of 8 days. as in the north american trial,
a clear correlation was evident between objective tumor
response and symptom improvement: 77.8% with partial
remission and 53.3% of those with stable disease achieved
symptomatic relief. those with symptomatic improvement
also had longer progression-free survival (4.2 vs. 2 months)
and overall survival (not reached [nr] vs. 6.7 months). the
quality of life improved for 24% and 22% of those receiving 250 mg and 500 mg/d, respectively. as in the
ideal 2 trial, a clear link was observed between symptom improvement, progression-free survival, overall survival, and objective tumor response.

lease (expanded access) program coordinated by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals. ruckdeschel and colleagues from h.
lee moffitt (34) prospectively assessed the activity of gefitinib administered to patients enrolled in the compassionate release program. a total of 86 patients, including nearly
50% with ecog ps 2-3, received gefitinib at a low dose of
250 mg/d; 9.3% were chemotherapy-naive, 27.9% had received one prior chemotherapeutic regimen, and 62.8% had
received two or more prior regimens. only 5.8% responded
to therapy with gefitinib, and 23.3% achieved stable disease.
the use of prior treatment did not influence the response
rate. of 86 patients enrolled, 33 had rapid disease progression, usually within 1 month. the vast majority of toxicities
were grade 1. grade 2 rashes occurred in 7.5%, nausea in
9.4%, and bone pain in 7.5%. in addition, the authors
observed weakness and fatigue in 11.3% and anorexia in
5.7%. twelve patients (14%) received at least 6 months of
therapy.
in a similar effort, janne and colleagues (35) evaluated
their experience with compassionate-use gefitinib. they enrolled 100 patients. the median age was 62 years (range
26 – 83); 98% had stage iv or recurrent disease. the predominant histologic findings included adenocarcinoma in
44%; nsclc, not otherwise specified in 26%; and bronchoalveolar carcinoma in 12%: 88% had been exposed to
taxanes. enrollees had received a median of two prior
chemotherapeutic regimens. seventy-eight patients received
gefitinib for ⬎1 month and were therefore assessable for
response and toxicity. the median duration of treatment in
this group was 2.5 months. as in the moffitt effort, most
drug-related adverse events were mild; one of the most
common toxicities, diarrhea, was readily treated with loperamide. only 2 patients had grade 3 cutaneous toxicity. of
94 assessable patients, 6 had a partial response, for a total
response rate of 6.4%. responses were confined to patients
with bronchoalveolar carcinoma (3) and adenocarcinoma
(3). stable disease and/or minor responses were observed in
another 19 patients (20.2%). the median survival was 5

months, comparable to the results observed in the randomized phase ii efforts. although the response rate was very
modest, the therapeutic index of this drug was enhanced by
its relatively minimal toxicity.

phase iii evaluations of gefitinib in treatment-naive
advanced nsclc
two separate, multicenter, international, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase iii trials in advanced nsclc have been conducted with ⬎1000 patients
apiece (36, 37). the trials’ treatment and randomization
schemes were nearly identical (fig. 2). chemotherapy-naive
patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy (either gemcitabine and cisplatin [intact i] or paclitaxel and carboplatin
[intact ii]) in combination with gefitinib (at either 250 or
500 mg/d) or placebo. survival was the primary end point in
both trials, each of which completed accrual in the summer
of 2001. the demographics of the two trials differed in
some potentially important respects. intact i, largely
conducted in europe and canada, accrued significantly
more stage iiia and iiib patients and had a far lower
percentage of women enrolled (table 5) compared with
intact ii. however, neither trial showed the hoped for
survival advantage for the triplet regimens that included
gefitinib (36, 37). in intact i, the median survival for
those receiving gefitinib 500 mg/d was 9.9 months compared with 9.86 months for those receiving 250 mg/d and
11.07 months for the placebo control group. the corresponding 1-year survival rates were 43%, 41%, and 45%.
the corresponding median progression-free survival was
5.55, 5.85, and 5.98 months (log-rank p ⫽ 0.7633) respectively. similar results were observed in intact ii, a
largely u.s. effort. the median survival for those receiving
gefitinib 500 mg/d was 8.74 months compared with 9.82
months for those receiving 250 mg/d and 9.92 months for
the placebo control group. the corresponding 1-year survival rates were 37%, 41%, and 42% (log-rank p ⫽ 0.64 –

0.67 vs. placebo). the corresponding median progressionfree survival was 4.67, 5.32, and 5.07 months, respectively.
these results were a major disappointment and, to some
extent, a surprise, given the strength of the preclinical data
supporting combinations of gefitinib and chemotherapy. it
is unclear why intact i and intact ii failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit. several theories have been advanced. selection has been identified as a potential issue,
because no attempts were made to screen for egfr expression or evidence of activation of downstream markers in the
pathway (e.g., akt, map kinase, erk, and others). others
have postulated a timing issue, suggesting that sequential
therapy may be a better strategy for the use of targeted
therapeutics than their use concurrently with chemotherapy.
cycle-independent cytostatic agents such as egfr inhibitors may potentially abrogate the efficacy of cycle-dependent cytotoxic agents such as paclitaxel. a relevant example
of this may be the use of tamoxifen concurrently with rt or
chemotherapy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer
(38); sequential use of tamoxifen gives a better outcome. it
is also worth noting that, historically, three drugs, regardless
of their mechanisms of action, have seldom proved superior
to two in studies in patients with advanced nsclc. to
address some of these issues, several cooperative groups are
now considering randomized phase ii trials evaluating standard chemotherapy or rt either preceded or followed by
gefitinib.
gefitinib: conclusions and future directions.
phase i, ii, and iii trials of iressa have demonstrated
conclusively that gefitinib can block egfr activation in
skin (albanell), and that radiographic and symptomatic
responses occur in roughly 10% of patients with nsclc

previously treated with chemotherapy. diarrhea and a
mechanism-based acneiform rash are the major side effects,
but seldom prove dose limiting. phase ii trials have confirmed the encouraging tumor responses seen in phase i
studies, with overall radiographic responses in 14% and
symptomatic benefit in just under 40% of enrollees. responses tended to occur more commonly in women, nonsmokers, and those with histologic findings of adenocarcinoma or bronchoalveolar carcinoma. the vast majority of
responses generally occurred within 4 weeks of treatment
initiation. to date, no obvious correlation has been found
between the level of egfr expression and outcome (as was
the case in studies of trastuzumab), but many of the studies
did not include systematic assessments of egfr expression
in all subjects. phase iii trials evaluating the addition of
gefitinib given concurrently with standard chemotherapy in
treatment-naive patients with advanced nsclc were quite
disappointing, with no demonstrated benefit on any clinical
parameter, including survival. future efforts must focus on
mechanisms underlying the response and resistance to gefitinib, as well as defining any pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug– drug interactions when gefitinib is
added to other cytotoxic agents. the southwestern oncology group study 0023 exemplifies the next generation of
trials and will evaluate induction therapy with concurrent
etoposide, cisplatin, and rt in locally advanced, unresectable nsclc followed by consolidative therapy with docetaxel for three cycles, followed by randomization to either
gefitinib or placebo. this intergroup effort has a target of
⬎900 patients for accrual. as of december 2003, 345
patients had been accrued. the cancer and leukemia group
b is assessing this agent in combination with chemotherapy
followed by radiotherapy combined with either gefitinib
alone in ecog ps 2 patients or chemotherapy (paclitaxel/
carboplatin) and gefitinib in good-risk patients. the japanese are evaluating gefitinib in a placebo-controlled phase
iii trial in stage ib-iiia resected patients. this effort will
ultimately target 670 patients for accrual. the primary end
points include overall survival and progression-free survival. a virtually identical trial is being conducted through
the national cancer institute canada and the cancer treatment support unit. in addition, investigators are evaluating
the role of gefitinib as a chemopreventive agent in former or
current smokers with a previous history of cancer; these
efforts include measurement in patients of a number of
biomarkers, including ki-67, map kinase, and akt, and
changes in the incidence of bronchial metaplasia or dysplasia.

therapy- or radiation-induced dna damage, as well as
promotion of tumor cell apoptosis (39). cetuximab (imcc225 or erbitux) is a chimeric (human-murine) monoclonal
antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the
egfr that blocks ligand (egf, transforming growth factor-␣) access to the receptor (40). cetuximab combined with
rt or chemotherapy in preclinical models has shown impressive antitumor activity that is usually additive and often
synergistic. in a431 and kb xenograft models, cetuximab
has demonstrated synergy with cisplatin (41, 42). similarly,
in pancreatic cancer mouse xenografts, cetuximab has demonstrated enhanced activity in combination with gemcitabine. this agent may also help reverse resistance to chemotherapy. in human bladder cancer xenografts (43)
cetuximab causes a decrease in mrna protein expression
and levels of vascular endothelial grown factor (39). in
a431 tumor xenografts (41, 42) cetuximab treatment leads
to significant inhibition of new vessel formation, with a
significant tumor growth delay. cetuximab has also demonstrated synergy with rt in a variety of animal models
(fig. 3) (44).
clinical trials of cetuximab have shown promise (45–51).
in a phase i trial in 52 patients with scchn or nsclc,
cetuximab, either alone or in combination with cisplatin,
was well-tolerated (45). in the pilot trial of scchn, in
which cetuximab was combined with cisplatin 100 mg/m2
every 3 weeks for three cycles, 6 of 9 assessable patients
demonstrated a radiographic tumor response. in a separate
trial in advanced scchn, enrolling patients whose disease
had progressed during either cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or
cisplatin and paclitaxel therapy, cetuximab, combined with
the same dose and schedule of platinum to which the tumor
had failed to respond, yielded a 20% response rate in

patients with a previous best response of stable disease and
a 21% response rate in patients whose tumors had actually
progressed during a cisplatin-based regimen (46, 47)
finally, a key randomized phase iii trial assessing cisplatin either alone or in combination with cetuximab in
treatment-naive incurable advanced scchn was recently
completed by the ecog (48) the primary end point of this
effort was the time to progression, with crossover at the time
of progression allowed for patients in the placebo arm.
eligibility stipulated good performance status (ecog ps
0 –1) and no prior treatment for metastasis or recurrence
after previous rt. a total of 121 patients were enrolled in
this study between june 1999 and june 2001. the mean age
was 59 years (range 32– 86), and 76% were men. patients
enrolled in the cetuximab arm had a significantly greater
incidence of rash overall (36 of 60 vs. 7 of 63, p ⫽ 0.0001)
and a greater incidence of grade 3 rash (7 of 60 vs. 0 of 63).
patients in the cetuximab arm also had a greater incidence
of grade 3 or worse neutropenia (14 of 60 vs. 8 of 63). the
response rate was somewhat better in the cetuximab arm
than in the placebo arm (22% vs. 9%), with borderline
statistical significance (p ⫽ 0.0508). the relative progression-free survival for the cisplatin-cetuximab combination
was 4.1 months vs. 3.37 months for the cisplatin-placebo
arm, with a relative median survival of 9.19 months and
7.96 months, respectively (p ⫽ 0.18). the respective 1- and
2-year survival rate for the cetuximab-cisplatin arm was
37% and 29% vs. 27% and 17% for the placebo-cisplatin
control arm, respectively. of those enrolled in the platinumcetuximab arm, those without rash had a response rate of
13.6% and those who developed a rash had a response rate
of 23.7%. among all patients enrolled, those without a rash

had a response rate of 8% vs. 25% for those with the rash (p

in addition to chemotherapy, evidence of putative synergy between cetuximab and rt has been observed. several
interactions have been postulated. these include g1 cell
cycle arrest; inhibition of cellular proliferation; enhanced
radiation-induced apoptosis; inhibition of radiation-induced
damage repair; and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (44,
49). in a431 xenografts, the radiation enhancement factor
for cetuximab, administered both before and after rt, was
3.62 (44). in a phase i trial combining full-dose  xxxd467xxx  and
rt in treatment-naive patients with locally advanced scchn, all 15 patients responded and all but 2 had complete
remissions (50). on the basis of these preclinical data and
promising results in the phase i study, an international,
multicenter phase iii trial in locally advanced, newly diagnosed scchn has recently completed accrual. this study
assessed the role of cetuximab in combination with radical
definitive rt vs. rt alone (fig. 4). more than 400 patients
have been accrued. to date, no protocol-limiting toxicity
has been reported.
cetuximab is generally given in a loading dose of 400
mg/m2 i.v. on day 1, followed by 250 mg/m2/wk i.v. the drug
is generally well tolerated, with few toxicities that overlap
those of conventional chemotherapy. as with the oral small
molecule egfr inhibitors, it causes a self-limited acneiform
rash, described as a sterile, suppurative folliculitis with multiple lesions extending over the face, neck, and trunk. this
usually occurs during the first 2 weeks of treatment, generally
eases during continued treatment, and resolves spontaneously
without scarring on treatment cessation.
the experience with cetuximab in pulmonary malignancy
has lagged behind its evaluation in advanced head-and-neck
cancer. three separate phase ii trials in advanced nsclc are
ongoing. one orchestrated through the university of colorado
assesses full-dose cetuximab in combination with paclitaxel
and carboplatin. another similar trial, orchestrated through the

university of alabama, evaluates cetuximab in combination
with gemcitabine 1 g/m2 on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin (area
under the curve 5.5) every 3 weeks. finally, in the salvage
setting, a collaborative consortium study conducted through
the m.d. anderson cancer center and the university of chicago has tested docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, in combination with cetuximab (51). eligibility for the latter study
stipulated disease progression during or within 3 months of
prior therapy, 1–3⫹ egfr expression by immunohistochemistry, and a limit of one prior regimen for advanced nsclc.
the statistical goals were a response rate of 25%; with
ⱖ50 patients accrued, this target would yield a 90%
power to differentiate an overall response rate of 25% vs.
a conventional response rate of 10%. as of the american
society for clinical oncology 2002 meeting, 30 patients
had been accrued, with an equal distribution of men and
women. of these, all but 2 patients had ecog ps 0 –1,
and 25 of 30 had 3⫹ egfr expression. the overall
response rate was 26%, including five confirmed and
three unconfirmed responses. toxicity has proved acceptable, with a 23% incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia
and a 10% incidence of grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions. the progression-free and overall median survival
have not yet been reported. no significant pharmokinetic
interactions have occurred between docetaxel and cetuximab.
many unanswered questions remain. the role of cetuximab,
if any, in thoracic cancer, either in advanced disease or locally
advanced unresectable nsclc, has not yet been established.
nor is it clear whether the benefit is confined to those with a
high level of egfr expression. in addition, some evidence
from the studies in head-and-neck cancer suggest that cetuximab might work better in patients with squamous cell histologic features, although this will require considerably more
evaluation. finally, it is unclear whether the disappointing
phase iii experience observed with the small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitors applies to antibodies such as cetuximab.

other egfr inhibitors
ci 1033 is an irreversible pan-erb inhibitor, blocking the
 xxxg2198xxx  activity of all four members of the egfr
family (egfr [or  xxxg682xxx  or  xxxg682xxx ], her2,  xxxg722xxx , and  xxxg723xxx ).
doses in the range of 2– 450 mg/d have been assessed. in 68
patients with advanced disease, the most common adverse
events included grade 1-2 nausea in 25%, grade 1-2 emesis
in 25%, grade 1-2 asthenia in 23%, and grade 1-2 diarrhea
in 15% (52). an ongoing randomized phase ii trial is
assessing three different doses in nsclc patients who have
received one or two prior regimens.
murren and colleagues (53) from yale have reported the
preliminary results of a phase i trial of pki166. thirty-two
patients received this drug at six separate dose levels ranging from 50 to 600 mg/d. the predominant primary tumor
sites included colorectal in 9, head and neck in 5, and
nsclc in 5. all patients had received at least one prior
chemotherapy regimen. the most frequent drug-related toxicities included diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and reversible
transaminase elevations. pharmacokinetics were linear and
dose proportional. qualitative decreases of phosphorylated
and total egfr were observed in tumor, skin, and hair
follicle samples.
 xxxd2445xxx , another small molecule dual inhibitor of the
egfr and her2 tyrosine kinases, was evaluated in healthy
volunteers. single oral doses as great as 250 mg were
well-tolerated, and multiple dosing (eight daily doses) of
 xxxd2445xxx  was also well-tolerated, producing only moderate accumulation after systemic exposure. formal phase i

volume 58, number 3, 2004

trials of short-term and chronic dosing in patients with
advanced cancer are ongoing (54, 55).

conclusion
clear evidence of activity for both gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx 
as single agents in advanced, heavily pretreated nsclc has
been demonstrated. even though the food and drug administration approved gefitinib in may 2003 for the treatment of patients with nsclc refractory to platinum and
taxane-containing regimens, none of these agents has demonstrated a therapeutic advantage in combination with cytotoxic therapy vs. cytotoxic therapy alone. that these
agents will ultimately contribute to our current therapeutic
arsenal is not in doubt, but the extent to which they will help
improve the survival of patients with nsclc remains in
question. to optimize their use in the treatment of nsclc,
we need accurate biomarkers to identify appropriate patients
for their use and clinical tests to detect evidence of biologic
effect (or no effect). to this end, we await the results of
ongoing and upcoming clinical trials examining various
innovative schemes for their use in the treatment of advanced disease, their utility as maintenance therapy, and
their use in secondary cancer prevention strategies. one can
hope that the evidence of clinical activity of egfr inhibitors in advanced nsclc will lead, eventually, through
systematic clinical investigation, to their use in the earliest
stages of lung cancer therapy, including adjuvant therapy
and prevention.
