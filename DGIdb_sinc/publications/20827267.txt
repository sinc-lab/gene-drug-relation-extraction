status, and the effects of tamoxifen on lipid
levels: revised and updated results

we previously reported that the  xxxg730xxx  xbai genotypes were
associated with baseline and tamoxifen-induced serum
lipid profiles. the analysis in that study was carried out
by pcr followed by restriction-enzyme digestion. after
reanalysis using more robust taqman assays, the findings
related to ~10% of the genotypes for the  xxxg730xxx  xbai singlenucleotide polymorphism (snp) were revised. for the other
genotypes (i.e.,  xxxg730xxx  pvuii,  xxxg731xxx , and cyp2d6), the results
were nearly identical to those in the previous study. upon
reanalysis, previously reported associations between the
 xxxg730xxx  xba1 genotypes and baseline triglyceride and lowdensity lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol levels were no longer
observed. previously reported associations between the  xxxg730xxx 
xbai genotypes and tamoxifen-induced changes in levels of
total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein
(hdl) cholesterol were also no longer observed. however,
the following observations from the original report did not
change: (i) the levels of circulating lipids are lower in women
taking tamoxifen; (ii) there is an association between the
 xxxg731xxx -02 genotypes and changes in triglyceride levels; and
(iii) neither  xxxg730xxx  pvuii nor cyp2d6 is associated with any
changes in serum lipid concentrations in patients receiving
treatment with tamoxifen.
tamoxifen is a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator that has
tissue-specific estrogen agonistic or antagonistic properties. 1
we and others have previously reported that tamoxifen induces
favorable lipid profiles, presumably because of an estrogenic
effect in the liver, mediated through the estrogen receptors alpha
and beta ( xxxg730xxx , beta).2 the genes that encode these receptors ( xxxg730xxx 
and 2) are highly polymorphic.3 tamoxifen is a relatively ­inactive
prodrug, but it is converted to active metabolites, including

4-hydroxy tamoxifen and 4-hydroxy-n-desmethyl tamoxifen
(designated endoxifen).4 conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen
is highly dependent on the activity of the enzymatic product
of cyp2d6, which is also highly polymorphic.5 therefore, we
hypothesized that the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen on lipid
profile might be associated with inherited single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) in the genes that encode for the targets
or the metabolic enzymes that mediate its activity.
we previously reported2 that tamoxifen significantly lowered
levels of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol (p < 0.0001)
and increased levels of triglycerides (p = 0.006). in postmenopausal
women, the  xxxg730xxx  xbai gg genotype was associated with relatively
greater tamoxifen-induced reductions in total cholesterol level as
compared with the ga and aa genotypes (p = 0.03). the  xxxg730xxx 
xbai refers to the snp rs no. 9340799, and the  xxxg730xxx  pvuii refers
to the snp rs no. 2234693. in premenopausal women, the  xxxg730xxx 
xbai gg genotype was associated with a large tamoxifen-induced
elevation in triglyceride concentration, whereas tamoxifen-treated
women with the aa and ag genotypes had little or no change in
triglyceride level (p = 0.002; gene–dose effect). in contrast, premenopausal women with the  xxxg730xxx  xbai aa genotype showed
elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol after
4 months of treatment with tamoxifen, whereas those with the ag
genotype showed no change in these levels, and those with the
gg genotype showed a reduction (p = 0.004; gene–dose effect). in
postmenopausal women, the  xxxg731xxx -02 gg genotype was significantly associated with tamoxifen-induced elevations in serum tri­
glyceride level, whereas there was no discernible change in women
with the ag genotype and a reduction in triglyceride level in those
with the aa genotype (p = 0.01; gene–dose effect). we concluded
that  xxxg730xxx  genotyping might be useful in predicting
which patients would benefit more from tamoxifen.

reports
the genotyping data for  xxxg730xxx  on which our prior report was
based were generated by pcr followed by restriction-enzyme
digestion (restriction fragment length polymorphism, rflp),
methods previously described by other investigators.6 we subsequently redetermined the genotypes using taqman assays and
found that ~10% of the genotypes for the  xxxg730xxx  xbai snp, as
determined by rflp, were discordant. we report reanalysis of
our data using the more accurate taqman assay.
results
comparison of genotype results obtained by taqman assay
vs. those obtained by rflp

each of the available 167 specimens was regenotyped using
taqman methodology, for each of the genotypes ( xxxg730xxx  xbai
and pvuii;  xxxg731xxx -01 and -02) reported by ntukidem et al.2 each
taqman genotype assay was performed on two separate occasions. all replicate taqman assay results for each genotype were
identical.
concordance between the results of taqman and rflp
geno­typing assays for  xxxg730xxx  pvuii,  xxxg731xxx -01, and -02 was ≥98%.
taqman genotyping was successfully determined for  xxxg730xxx  xbai
in 157 of the 167 available dna specimens (see supplementary
figure s1 online). of these, 17 results (10.8%) showed discordance on comparison.
correlation between genotype and phenotype
associations between  xxxg730xxx  pvuii,  xxxg731xxx , and cyp2d6 genotypes, and
lipid levels and clinical features. in the findings from the rean-

alysis, we observed that the previously reported associations
between menopausal status and serum lipid concentrations at
baseline, and between tamoxifen use and tamoxifen-­associated
change in lipid levels, remained unchanged. likewise, as in
the original report, changes in triglyceride levels were significantly associated with  xxxg731xxx -02 genotypes, whereas there was

no association between either the  xxxg730xxx  pvuii or the cyp2d6
genotype and changes in serum lipid concentrations after
tamoxifen treatment (see supplementary table s1 online and
supplementary figure s1 online).
associations between  xxxg730xxx  xbai and lipids. we previously reported2

a statistically significant association between total cholesterol
level at baseline before tamoxifen treatment in all women and,
in subgroup analysis, in premenopausal women with  xxxg730xxx 
xba1 genotypes. in the reanalysis with taqman assay genotyping, these associations were not observed (p = 0.23 and 0.94,
respectively; table 1). likewise, previously reported associations were no longer detected between ldl-cholesterol level
in the entire data set and in the premenopausal subgroup
with  xxxg730xxx  xbai genotypes (p = 0.15 and 0.93, respectively;
table 1).
in agreement with the findings using rflp genotyping, after
4 months of treatment with tamoxifen, there were no detectable
associations between taqman-analyzed  xxxg730xxx  xbai genotypes
and levels of triglycerides, hdl cholesterol, and ldl cholesterol
(table 2). although the previously reported association was
again observed between the gg genotype of xbai and greater
reduction in total cholesterol level, it was not statistically significant in the reanalysis (reduction in total cholesterol for each
genotype: aa (n = 31) −28 mg/dl; ag (n = 30) −13 mg/dl; and
gg (n = 13) −41 mg/dl; p = 0.06) (table 2). also, the previously
reported correlations between xbai genotypes and triglyceride
levels in premenopausal women were not observed in the reanalysis (figure 1b). although the changes in hdl-cholesterol
levels associated with the xbai genotypes were quantitatively
similar to those previously observed in this group of patients,
these changes failed to reach statistical significance in the reanalysis (p = 0.09) (figure 1c). as before, no statistically significant associations were detected between xbai genotypes and

discussion

tamoxifen exerts its biological action through binding with its
receptors,  xxxg730xxx  and beta, encoded by the genes  xxxg730xxx  and 2, respectively. using an older assay, we had reported selected associations between snps in these genes and the favorable effect of
tamoxifen on lipid profiles. in this report, we have identified that,
for one of these alleles ( xxxg730xxx  xbai), reanalysis with the more
accurate assay, taqman, indicated that ~10% of the ­previously
assigned genotypes were incorrect. in contrast, our previously
reported genotypes for  xxxg730xxx  pvuii,  xxxg731xxx , and cyp2d6 were
correct (98–100% concordance between assays).
in a reanalysis of the clinical associations of inherited germline snps, using the genotypes derived from the taqman
assays, we no longer detected the previously reported statistically ­significant association between  xxxg730xxx  xba1 genotype and
baseline triglyceride level in all women or between  xxxg730xxx  xba1
genotype and baseline triglyceride or ldl-cholesterol level in
the premenopausal subset. likewise, in postmenopausal women,
628

we no longer detected any statistically significant associations
between  xxxg730xxx  xbai genotype and tamoxifen-induced changes
in total cholesterol level, nor in premenopausal women between
 xxxg730xxx  xbai genotype and tamoxifen-induced changes in triglyceride or hdl-cholesterol level. most of these differences in the
findings are attributable to genotype reassignment in the ~10%
of subjects in whom the genotype had initially been incorrectly
assigned on the basis of rflp genotyping.
these data may have relevance to many other studies using
rflp assays in general but specifically to those using it for
detecting variants in  xxxg730xxx , originally described by herrington
et al.6 we are not certain of the cause of the original genotyping
errors. we believe that incomplete digestion of the pcr product
by the xbai enzyme may have contributed to the error, possibly
because of a reagent problem, a tube heating block problem, or
an unknown factor in the dna sample that partially blocked
the enzyme. alternatively, there may have been some peak suppression on the instrument that was used to analyze the digested
pcr products. this circumstance could result from too little or
too much dna in the sample, a manufacturing problem with
the chip, or an imperfection in the corresponding reagent. we

reports
repeated the rflp assay on the dna samples from these subjects and obtained the correct genotyping results, thereby indicating that there is no problem specific to the snp that affects the
assay. given that the frequencies of occurrence of these errors
are small, they were not observed in our original development
and validation of the rflp assay. in summary, we believe that
these are random errors that may or may not be present in assays
conducted by other investigators.
it is possible that some of the differences in our ­observations,
such as the tamoxifen-induced changes in total cholesterol
levels in postmenopausal women (p = 0.06; table 2) and in
hdl-cholesterol levels in premenopausal women (p = 0.09,
figure 1c), are attributable to loss of statistical power because
not all the specimens were available for the reanalysis. however,
power calculations for the results presented in tables 1 and 2
(current version), and their corresponding tables (table 3a,b
in the original version), do not support this hypothesis. it is
clear that if the number of samples assayed were decreased,
but the size of the genetic effects were assumed to be the same,
then the 5% reduction in sample size would have led to only a
3–4% reduction in power. therefore, the difference between the
original report and the reanalysis is unlikely to be due to the
decrease in the number of samples per se. instead, it appears
that the loss of statistical power is the result of a decrease in
the magnitude of the genetic effects observed, which in turn
is a consequence of the reassignment of genotypes made
necessary by the corrections in the genotyping results. the
following other observations from the original submission
have not changed: (i) circulating lipid levels are decreased
in women taking tamoxifen, a finding that is consistent with
other reports; (ii) changes in triglyceride levels were statistically associated with  xxxg731xxx -02 genotype; and (iii) there was no
association between either  xxxg730xxx  pvuii or cyp2d6 genotype
and changes in serum lipid concentrations after treatment with
tamoxifen.
methods

subjects, study design, sample collection, and lipid analysis. the sub-

jects, study design, sample collection, and lipid analysis details have
been previously described, including exclusion of perimenopausal
women and patients taking lipid-lowering medications (clinicaltrials.
gov identifier nct00228930) (ref. 2). archived genomic dna specimens were selected for reanalysis using the taqman assay. of the 176
specimens included in the original report by ntukidem et al., 9 had
been exhausted by previous testing, and therefore 167 (95%) of the original specimens were available for this reanalysis (see supplementary
figure s1 online).

genotyping. in our previous report,2 genotyping for  xxxg730xxx  was conducted

using the rflp method, previously described in studies of the effects
of estrogens on lipid levels in postmenopausal women,6 whereas  xxxg731xxx 
genotyping was performed using the taqman method.2 in this study,
to ensure uniform quality control, all specimens were regenotyped for
 xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  using taqman assays in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) as previously
described and validated7 (http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov;  xxxg731xxx -01: rs
no. 1256049;  xxxg731xxx -02: rs no. 4986938).  xxxg730xxx  genotypes for rs2234693
( xxxg730xxx  pvuii) and rs9340799 ( xxxg730xxx  xbai) were determined using the

following taqman assays: c_3163590_10 for the rs no. 2234693 and
c_3163591_10 for the rs no. 9340799. in a previous publication by
consortium on breast cancer pharmacogenomics (cobra) investigators, the concordance rate between these two assays and manual dna
sequencing was >99% in 220 subjects.7 as a further confirmation, each
specimen was genotyped twice using taqman assays, and any results that
were discordant with the previous rflp assay results were retested by
dna sequencing. all samples were also regenotyped for  xxxg731xxx  using the
taqman assay previously described.2 in our previous report, the results of
the cyp2d6 genotyping were from at least two different methodologies
that showed 100% concordance, and therefore we did not repeat cyp2d6
genotyping in this genotyping analysis.
statistical analysis. detailed methods for statistical analytical correla-

tions among clinical factors, lipids, and genotypes have been ­previously
described,2 and the reanalyses of these correlations in the current report
were performed identically. in addition, a similar reanalysis was performed by a completely separate and independent statistical team with
identical results (see supplementary table s1 online, supplementary
figure s1 online, and acknowledgments).
