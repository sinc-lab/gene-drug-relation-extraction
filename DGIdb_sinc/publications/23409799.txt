5-year overall survival (os) is only 10 -- 30% [2,9-11]. the firstline therapies in ptcl are relatively ineffective, in part due to
advanced stage at presentation, high international prognostic
index (ipi) and the presence of systemic symptoms [2,3,12,13].
as of yet there are no approved first-line treatment regimens
for patients with ptcl.
currently patients with ptcl are treated based on the
multiagent regimen used for aggressive b-cell lymphoma
which includes cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine
and prednisone (chop). unfortunately, the results of
chop therapy in ptcl patients are not spectacular, with
most studies reporting a 5-year os of less than 40% [3]. clinicians have explored the use of other multidrug regiments
such as choep (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone), hyper-cvad (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
alternating with high-dose methotrexate and  xxxd1790xxx ) as
well as pegs (cisplatin, etoposide, gemcitabine and methylprednisolone) [14-16]. while younger patients may derive
some benefit from a more intensive chemotherapy, overall
these regiments are more toxic and do not improve clinical
outcome in patients with ptcl [2,14]. certainly, this illustrates the need for novel, more efficacious treatment regimens
for patients with ptcl. current recommendations suggest
that ptcl patients receive consolidation with autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (asct). patients with
alk+ alcl are the only exception to this rule. consolidation
with allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered
in ptcl patients with appropriate donors.
moreover, there is no standard therapeutic approach in
patients with relapsed or refractory ptcls. patients who fail
first-line therapy are often treated with ice (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide), dhap (dexamethasone,  xxxd1790xxx ,
and cisplatin) or eshap (etoposide, methylprednisone,

 xxxd1790xxx , and cisplatin), however the outcomes have, for
the most part, been dismal. while consolidation with an
asct has been used in advanced cases with some degree of
success, many patients are refractory to induction therapy.
the 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival are
as low as 33% and 24%, respectively [16,17]. furthermore,
there are no dedicated randomized controlled studies
evaluating the role of asct in relapsed or refractory ptcl.
a number of older and newer agents have been used in
patients with relapsed or refractory ptcl. gemcitabine is a cytidine analog that has been used in ptcl alone or in combination
with other agents such as etoposide and chop [18,19]. the new
agents include  xxxd3144xxx  [20], alemtuzumab [21],  xxxd1832xxx  [22], bortezomib [23], lenalidomide [24] and  xxxd2992xxx  [25].
however, information stemming from the studies evaluating
these agents is limited, in part due to small size and lack of large
multicenter randomized trials. furthermore, some evidence is
only based on anecdotal case reports from single centers.
 xxxd2992xxx  ((rs)- xxxd2992xxx ) is a
novel selective antifolate agent that belongs to a class of molecules known as 10-deazaaminopterins (box 1). it appears to
be both more potent and efficacious than methotrexate
(mtx) and edatrexate (edx). in vitro experiments demonstrated greater cytotoxicity against lymphoma, non-small cell
lung cancer (nsclc) and breast cancer cells when compared
to mtx [26,27] and edx [28]. early clinical evaluation of  xxxd2992xxx  demonstrated greater activity in t-cell lymphomas
when compared to b-cell lymphomas [29]. in september
2009, based on the results of the pivotal  xxxd2992xxx  in
patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral t-cell
lymphoma (propel) study,  xxxd2992xxx  was the first singleagent therapy granted accelerated approval by the us food
and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of relapsed
or refractory ptcl [30].

pharmacology

 xxxd2992xxx  is a small molecule with a chemical formula
 xxxd2992xxx  and a molecular weight of 477.48 g/mol
(box 1). it competitively inhibits  xxxg631xxx 
(dhfr) and  xxxg2366xxx . 10-deazaaminopterins
were designed to have greater affinity for reduced folate
carrier protein-1 (rtc-1), which is overexpressed in cancer
cells [26,31], and folypolyglutamate synthase ( xxxg814xxx ).  xxxd2992xxx  enters the cell via rtc-1 and undergoes polyglutamination via  xxxg814xxx . the metabolic inhibition of dhfr results
in depletion of  xxxd3365xxx  (tmp) and other
biological molecules which are required for dna and rna
synthesis. this effectively halts cellular proliferation leading
to cell death.  xxxd2992xxx  has 10 times the affinity of mtx
for rtc-1 and is a much more potent substrate for  xxxg814xxx ,
leading to greater internalization and retention within cancer
cells [28]. studies demonstrated that the km values for  xxxd2992xxx  and methotrexate were 0.3 and 4.8 Âµmol/l, respectively, while the rate of intracellular transport, measured
by vmax/km values, was 12.6 for  xxxd2992xxx  vs 0.9 for
mtx [32]. indeed, both in vitro and in vivo experiments illustrated that  xxxd2992xxx  is 5 -- 40 times more cytotoxic than
mtx [28,31,33]. like other antimetabolites  xxxd2992xxx  is
most effective against cells that are actively dividing, making
it an excellent candidate for aggressive malignancies.

pharmacokinetics

preclinical pharmacokinetic (pk) studies of  xxxd2992xxx  were
performed on beagle dogs and sprague--dawley rats. oral bioavailability was 13 -- 20% after an administration of a nonformulated preparation of  xxxd2992xxx . no significant differences
in pk parameters were observed after an intravenous administration of  xxxd2992xxx . initial clinical pk studies were performed
with intravenous  xxxd2992xxx  in patients with nsclc, bladder
cancer, ptcl and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ), over a
wide dose range (30 -- 325 mg/m2). pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental analysis after
intravenous administration of  xxxd2992xxx  on a weekly or a
biweekly schedule. over this dosing range,  xxxd2992xxx  had
linear pk parameters with both diastereomers demonstrating
a multiphasic decline in plasma concentration with a slow
terminal phase. the estimated half-life of  xxxd2992xxx  was
12 -- 18 h [34]. data from pdx-008 study suggested that the
pks did not change over multiple treatment cycles, without
net plasma accumulation after repeat dosing [34]. the diastereomers of  xxxd2992xxx  showed a steady-state volume of distribution of 37 l (r- xxxd2992xxx ) and 105 l (s- xxxd2992xxx ). urine
excretion of unchanged r- and s- xxxd2992xxx  was similar for
both enantiomers, with 34% of the drug excreted unchanged
in the urine [35]. the mean values for systemic clearance were
191 and 417 ml/min for the r- xxxd2992xxx  and s- xxxd2992xxx ,
respectively [34]. data from a phase i -- ii (pdx-02-078) study
demonstrated that the mean clearance of both enantiomers was

220 ml/min [36]. correcting for plasma protein binding suggests net renal tubular excretion. while there are no specific
guidelines for dose reduction in patients with renal impairment,
continuous monitoring of renal function is advised. furthermore, caution is advised for concomitant use of  xxxd2992xxx 
and other medications that may further impair renal clearance
such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
in vitro experiments show that  xxxd2992xxx  does not significantly inhibit or induce the cyp450 isozymes. metabolic stability studies indicate that  xxxd2992xxx  is not metabolized by
phase i hepatic cyp450 isoenzymes or phase ii hepatic glucuronidases. these studies suggest a low potential of inducing
hepatic toxicity with  xxxd2992xxx  [35].  xxxd2992xxx  is 67 -- 86%
bound to plasma protein, with albumin as the major binder.
it is not significantly displaced nor does it displace other substrates from the plasma proteins. additionally, it is neither an
antagonist nor an agonist of  xxxg12xxx 
(mdr). currently, a human mass balance study (pdx-016)
is ongoing, further evaluating the excretion and metabolism
of  xxxd2992xxx .

preclinical and initial clinical experience
with  xxxd2992xxx 

4.

 xxxd2992xxx  was developed by sirotnak and colleagues at the
memorial-sloan kettering cancer institute in collaboration
with southern research institute [37]. initial in vitro studies
demonstrated cytotoxic activity against a broad panel of cancer cells, including both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies [28]. the first clinical trials for  xxxd2992xxx  were
carried out in patients with relapsed or refractory nsclc [7].
the most common side effect of  xxxd2992xxx  was found to be
mucositis [7]. these initial studies were crucial as they paved
the way for clinical trials of  xxxd2992xxx  in patients with
hematologic malignancies (table 1). currently, there are
22 ongoing clinical trials investigating this agent in both solid
and hematologic malignancies [38].
the first dedicated trial of  xxxd2992xxx  in hematologic
malignancies, labeled pdx-02-78, was an open trial using
 xxxd2992xxx  at a dose of 135 mg/m2. this dose was selected
based on the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) defined in
patients with lung cancer. the purpose of this study was to
determine the mtd and efficacy of  xxxd2992xxx  in patients
with relapsed or refractory hodgkinâs lymphoma and nonhodgkinâs lymphoma (nhl).  xxxd2992xxx  was given every
other week, with dose escalation of 15 mg/m2 if no toxicity
was observed after two cycles [36]. this study included a total
of 16 patients (8 with aggressive lymphomas, 5 with
hodgkinâs lymphoma, 2 with mantle cell lymphoma, and
1 with ptcl). with this dose regimen all patients developed
grade 3 or 4 stomatitis. the patients also developed leukopenia (62%), lymphopenia (69%), and thrombocytopenia
(52%). using population-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis, the incidence of stomatitis and mucositis was associated with exposure to  xxxd2992xxx  in patients

with methylmalonic acid (mma) and homocysteine (hcy)
concentrations greater than 200 Âµmol/l and 10 Âµmol/l, respectively. it was noted that addition of folate and vitamin b12
supplements could prevent mucositis in these patients [29].
the study was amended to become a phase i/ii study, with
an mtd of 30 mg/m2. the objective of the phase i trial
was to determine the mtd and dose-limited toxicity (dlt)
of weekly  xxxd2992xxx . the dose escalation scheme of this
study was as follows: 30 mg/m2 weekly for 3 of 4 weeks;
30 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks every 7 weeks; then increasing
by 15 mg/m2 on the 7th week. all patients received vitamin
b12 and  xxxd2146xxx  supplementation in order to normalize
mma and hcy, thus minimizing toxicity. the dlt of
45 mg/m2 was established and the mtd was determined to
be 30 mg/m2/week for 6 weeks out of a 7-week cycle. in the
overall cohort, the incidence of stomatitis was only 17%, indicating a marked reduction when compared to the every-otherweek dosing schedule. the objective of the phase ii trial was to
determine the frequency and duration of complete and partial
remissions. in total 48 patients diagnosed with diffuse large bcell lymphoma, t-cell lymphoma and hodgkinâs lymphoma
were treated with the weekly  xxxd2992xxx  schedule. the overall
response rate (orr) was 31%, with 17% of patients achieving
complete remission (cr). a significantly higher response rate
was noted in patients with t-cell lymphomas when compared
to b-cell lymphomas, with an orr of 54% compared to
10%. the duration of response was estimated to be in the
range 3 -- 26 months. normalization of hcy and mma with
supplemental  xxxd2146xxx  and vitamin b12 reduced the severity
of mucositis. hematologic toxicity was minimal, with grade
2 thrombocytopenia observed in two patients. in addition,
an early clinical evaluation of 20 patients with lymphoma
demonstrated increased efficacy of  xxxd2992xxx  in patients
with t-cell lymphoma. of the 20 patients, 16 patients with
b-cell lymphoma demonstrated stable disease with  xxxd2992xxx 
518

treatment. conversely, the four patients with ptcl refractory
to standard treatment demonstrated complete remission with
 xxxd2992xxx  [25]. these studies were pivotal in demonstrating
the effectiveness of  xxxd2992xxx  in patients with refractory or
relapsed t-cell malignancies.

results of the propel study

based on promising data from previous studies, a prospective
multicenter single-arm open-label international phase ii clinical trial was launched in order to examine the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd2992xxx  in patients with refractory or relapsed
ptcl (propel; pdx-008) [39]. the primary end point of
the study was the response rate (rr) as defined by international
workshop criteria (iwc) [39,40]. the secondary end points
were duration of response (dor), progression-free survival
(pfs) and the overall survival (os). the study enrolled a total
of 115 patients with refractory or relapsed ptcl of which
111 were treated with intravenous  xxxd2992xxx  at a dose of
30 mg/m2/week for 6 weeks in a 7-week cycle. a dose reduction of 20 mg/m2/week was allowed if a patient experienced
predefined adverse events. all patients received  xxxd2146xxx  and
vitamin b12 supplements. all histological subtypes of tcell nhl were eligible for the trial, which were confirmed by
an independent central review using either the who or the
revised european american lymphoma classification. the
patients had to have refractory or relapsed disease after at least
one prior treatment attempt with no restriction on prior treatment attempts and an eastern cooperative oncology (ecog)
performance status of 0 -- 2. further, the study included
18 patients status post autologous stem cell transplant (sct)
and relapsed within 75 days of transplant. two patients were
excluded due to ineligible histology.
based on the international workshop criteria (iwc), the
overall response rate, among the 109 evaluable patients in

 xxxd2992xxx 

the propel study was 27%. that included complete
responses (crs), unconfirmed crs and partial responses
(prs). the overall response rate based on the cheson criteria
was 26% with 14% crs [41]. the median time to the first
response was 45 days (range 37 -- 349), with 66% patients
responding after the first cycle of treatment. the median duration of response was 10.1 months as per central review assessment. the median os and pfs were 14.5 months and
3.5 months, respectively. additional analysis demonstrates
that 30% of patients who have failed at least two prior conventional regiments for ptcl, including autologous sct,
responded to  xxxd2992xxx . the median duration of treatment
in patients who responded was 186 days. survival analyses
based on the cox proportional hazards model demonstrated
that patients that responded to  xxxd2992xxx  had a 56% decrease
in the risk of death when compared to nonresponders [42].
despite the patientsâ pretreatment with vitamin b12 and
folate, the most common adverse event was mucositis that
occurred in circa 70% patients, with 21% of them experiencing grade 3 -- 4 mucosal inflammation. hematologic toxicities
were thrombocytopenia (14% grade 3 and 19% grade 4) and
anemia (16% grade 3). other treatment-related toxicities
included fatigue (which occurred in 36% patients), nausea,
dyspnea and mild elevations of liver enzymes. febrile neutropenia was noted in 5% of patients. one death was attributed
to  xxxd2992xxx . dose reduction and dose omission due to
mucositis and thrombocytopenia was required in 34 (31%)
and 77 (72%) patients, respectively.
subsequent analysis of the propel study demonstrated
that  xxxd2992xxx  can be used in patients proceeding to sct.
six of the patients in the trial went on to receive sct (two
autologous sct and four allogeneic sct). at the time of initiation of their sct, four patients were in complete remission,
while other two were in partial remission. all six patients were
still alive at the time of last contact. this demonstrates that
patients with relapsed or refractory ptcls can proceed to subsequent sct after pretreatment with  xxxd2992xxx , permitting the
transplant option as a potential cure [43]. however, given that
this was only a subanalysis of the propel study, further evaluation of  xxxd2992xxx  as pretreatment before sct is necessary
in patients with refractory and/or relapsed ptcl.
the propel study was the largest prospective study ever
conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory ptcl. the
study demonstrated promising results in patients who have
failed previous treatment. based on the overall response rate,
the fda granted accelerated approval of  xxxd2992xxx  for
the treatment of relapsed or refractory t-cell lymphomas.
while the propel study demonstrated reduction in tumor
size, it did not show improvement in os or pfs prior to the
fda approval. therefore, the urgent need for novel therapies
contributed to the accelerated approval of  xxxd2992xxx . furthermore, the approval was based on the provision that postapproval, randomized clinical trials will be undertaken in order
to verify the clinical benefit of  xxxd2992xxx  in patients with
ptcl. currently, there are several ongoing phase iii

randomized multicenter studies investigating the response
of ptcl to  xxxd2992xxx  and survival in patients following
chop-based chemotherapy. one such study, pdx-017
[nct01420679], is a phase iii multicenter randomized trial
investigating the role of  xxxd2992xxx  after initial chemotherapy
with chop. preliminary data suggest that  xxxd2992xxx  may
have a role as consolidation or maintenance therapy following
initial treatment with chop in order to increase diseasefree interval [43]. furthermore, it is necessary to compare the
efficacy of  xxxd2992xxx  as a single agent with other novel compounds active in ptcl. currently, a phase iii randomized
two-arm open-label international trial [nct01482962] is evaluating the efficacy of  xxxd2992xxx  compared with other single
agents such as  xxxd3144xxx , gemcitabine and aliserib in patients
with relapsed or refractory ptcl [38].

new agents for the treatment of relapsed
or refractory t-cell lymphomas

6.

as the options for ptcl therapy are limited, the patients are
encouraged to enroll in clinical trials where available. besides
 xxxd2992xxx , we would like to briefly describe two new agents
active in ptcl such as  xxxd3144xxx  and  xxxd362xxx   xxxd3498xxx .
 xxxd3144xxx  ( xxxd1841xxx ) is a bi-cyclic peptide derived
from chromobacterium violaceum that inhibits the enzyme histone deacetylase. histone deacetylase plays a role in modulating
gene transcription and protein function. recent data from
phase ii clinical trial of  xxxd3144xxx  as a single agent for the
treatment of relapsed or refractory ptcl show an overall
response rate of 38% with a median response of duration
of 8.9 months [44]. subsequently, a larger phase ii study
(n = 117) involving patients with relapsed or refractory ptcl
demonstrated an overall response rate of 28% with a cr of
16% [45]. in 2011, fda approved  xxxd3144xxx  for the treatment
of relapsed or refractory peripheral t-cell lymphoma.  xxxd3144xxx  is generally well-tolerated, the most common are
fatigue, anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia [45].  xxxd3144xxx  has a similar response rate and activity to the ones of
 xxxd2992xxx . interestingly, a recent study conducted in mice
confirms synergistic activity between  xxxd2992xxx  and  xxxd3144xxx  [46]. perhaps, future studies can investigate the potential
clinical synergy between  xxxd3144xxx  and  xxxd2992xxx  in
patients with relapsed or refractory ptcl.
 xxxd362xxx   xxxd3498xxx  is an antibody--drug conjugate composed of anti- xxxg2302xxx  monoclonal antibody and cytotoxic agent
 xxxd3498xxx  ( xxxd3498xxx ). in 2011, the fda granted
accelerated approval of  xxxd362xxx   xxxd3498xxx  for the treatment
of hodgkin lymphoma (hl). in january 2012, it was approved
for the use in alcl after at least one failure of a multidrug
chemotherapy regimen.  xxxg2302xxx  is a transmembrane protein
strongly expressed in classical hl and alcl, a subtype of
ptcl [47,48]. the degree of expression of  xxxg2302xxx  in other subtypes of ptcl is variable. in ptcl-nos only 20% of cells
express  xxxg2302xxx , while aitl rarely expresses  xxxg2302xxx  [49,50].
results of a phase ii single-arm study of  xxxd362xxx   xxxd3498xxx 

expert opin. pharmacother. (2013) 14(4)

in relapsed/refractory alcl demonstrated an overall response
rate of 86% and a cr of 53% [51]. treatment-related adverse
events included peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue,
diarrhea and neutropenia [50]. while these results are impressive,  xxxd362xxx   xxxd3498xxx  can only be used for a small subtype of ptcl that expresses  xxxg2302xxx . its efficacy in lymphomas
other than hl or alcl is currently not known. presently,
clinical trials are ongoing (nct01421667) in an attempt to
evaluate the response to  xxxd362xxx   xxxd3498xxx  in patients with
lymphomas other than hl or alcl.
7. combination of  xxxd2992xxx  with
other agents

current research points to a potential synergy between  xxxd2992xxx  and other active agents in t-cell lymphoma. this fostered
attempts at combining these agents in order to improve response
rates and durability of responses in this group of diseases. based
on the preclinical and clinical data discussed above, a phase i -- ii
open-label multicenter study examining the combination of  xxxd2992xxx  and gemcitabine has been initiated in patients with
relapsed or refractory lymphoma (table 1) [52]. the objective
of this study is to find the mtd of this combination and use
it in the phase ii portion of the trial to examine the efficacy in
patients with relapsed or refractory ptcl and b-cell lymphoma.
three different treatment groups are being evaluated, with
the starting dose of  xxxd2992xxx  and gemcitabine ranging from
10 -- 15 mg/m2 and 400 -- 600 mg/m2, respectively. initial
analysis of the weekly dosing schedule demonstrated increased
incidence of mucositis, cellulitis, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leucopenia. the patients better tolerated
a bi-weekly dosing schedule. phase i data demonstrated a partial
response in 24% of patients with various lymphomas. preliminary results indicate that the combination of  xxxd2992xxx  and
gemcitabine is a feasible option that appears to be clinically
active. currently, a phase ii study is looking at the efficacy
with the established bi-weekly dosing schedule.

 xxxd2992xxx  in relapsed or refractory  xxxg2343xxx 

cutaneous t-cell lymphomas (ctcls) are indolent t-cell
lymphomas that primarily involve the skin. the majority are
classified as mycosis fungoides (mf), sezary syndrome (ss)
and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
(alcl) [53]. given the indolent course of these entities and
the class-specific t-cell activity of  xxxd2992xxx , a phase i
open-label multicenter study [pdx-010] clinical dose reduction trial was initiated in patients with refractory or relapsed
 xxxg2343xxx . the primary objective was to identify the optimal
dose and schedule of  xxxd2992xxx . patients were eligible for
the study if they were diagnosed with  xxxg2343xxx  (mf, ss or
alcl) and have failed at least one prior systemic therapy.
the initial dosing was extrapolated from the propel study.
patients were started on 30 mg/m2 with the addition of vitamin b12 and  xxxd2146xxx . a total of 31 patients were enrolled

and divided into six treatment groups based on different dosing schedule. the optimal dose was 15 mg/m2 with a 3-outof-41905-462.7(-4.2(c)3.8(itolle(i)0((objec)-31fcutane.7(rapya-09562.9291t988(

with ptcl, although disease-free survival is short and patients
with stage iv disease respond poorly. anthracycline-containing
regimens, the current therapy standards for ptcl, are associated with median 5-year os rates of less than 40%. because of
the inferior outcomes with chop-based regimens, novel strategies are needed for patients with aggressive t-cell lymphomas.
