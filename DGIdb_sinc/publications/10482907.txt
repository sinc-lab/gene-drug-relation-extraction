1  xxxg2366xxx  (ts), the key enzyme in de novo synthesis of thymidine, is an important
target for antitumour chemotherapy. it was hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotide downregulation of ts mrna would decrease ts levels and enhance the cytotoxicity of inhibitors of ts,
including the pyrimidine analogues 5-¯uorouracil (5-fu) and 5-¯uorodeoxyuridine ( xxxd2117xxx ), and
the folate analogue  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ; n-(5-[n-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6ylmethyl)-n-methylamino]-2-theonyl- xxxd2431xxx ).
2 2'-methoxyethoxylated, phosphorothioated 20-mer oligodeoxynucleotides (odns), complementary to various sequences in ts mrna, were synthesized, along with control oligomers consisting of
the same, respective bases in randomized order, against which all the biological eects were
compared. following a 6-h transfection of hela cells using polycationic liposome at 3 mg ml71,
odn 83 (50 nm), complementary to a region in the 3'-untranslated region of the ts mrna,
decreased ts mrna levels by approximately 70% within 24 h. odn 83 also decreased ts enzyme
activity, as measured by binding of ts to radiolabelled 5-¯uorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. in
addition to inhibiting proliferation by up to approximately 40%, odn 83 enhanced the cytotoxicity
of  xxxd3077xxx  or 5-fu, added 1 day following transfection, by 50 ± 60%. odn 83 also enhanced
sensitivity to  xxxd2117xxx  by 70%, but did not aect the toxicity of cisplatin,  xxxd1665xxx ,  xxxd2562xxx ,
doxorubicin, ionizing radiation, paclitaxel, or irinotecan.
3 these data indicate that antisense odn down-regulation of ts can inhibit human tumour cell
proliferation and enhance the ecacy of ts-targeted drugs.

introduction
 xxxg2366xxx  (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dump
c-methyltransferase;  xxxg2366xxx ) (ts) is a highly conserved
homodimer of 35 kda subunits which catalyzes the synthesis
of thymidylate from  xxxd1838xxx  and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (me- xxxd3334xxx ) (chu & allegra, 1996a; danenberg,
1977). the activity and expression of ts are tightly controlled
throughout the cell cycle, particularly at the translational level
(johnson, 1994). the ts protein itself binds to the ts mrna
both at the translational start site (tss) and in the coding
region, inhibiting translational processing of the message (chu
et al., 1991; 1993b). ts can also bind to the mrna of at least
nine other important gene products, including those of p53
(chu et al., 1996b) and c-myc (chu et al., 1994). therefore,
manipulating the level of the ts protein could induce a cascade
of consequential eects on cell growth.

because of its importance in dna precursor synthesis and
repair, ts has proved to be an important target for anticancer
chemotherapy. direct inhibitors of ts include the nucleoside
analogue 5-¯uorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (5-fdump) [a
derivative of 5-¯uorouracil (5-fu) and 5-¯uorodeoxyuridine
( xxxd2117xxx ) produced within mammalian cells], and folate
analogues such as n-(5-[n-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl-n-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)- xxxd2431xxx ,
( xxxd3077xxx ,  xxxd3077xxx ) (jackman et al., 1991). in drug-selected
cell lines, a common mechanism of resistance to both these
classes of drugs is increased cellular expression of ts (zhang et
al., 1992). however, in drug-sensitive cells, induction of
increased ts expression is also a potential impediment to
antitumor activity. 5-fdump, as well as me- xxxd3334xxx , relieve the
repression of ts mrna translation by the ts protein (chu &
allegra, 1996a; chu et al., 1991), resulting in a transient
increase in ts protein levels, a phenomenon observed in vitro
(chu et al., 1990; 1991; 1993a; keyomarsi et al., 1993; van der
wilt et al., 1992), in animals (van der wilt et al., 1992), and in

1778

p.j. ferguson et al

patients (peters et al., 1994; swain et al., 1989). this induction
of ts synthesis [upwards of 3 ± 5 fold (chu et al., 1990; 1993a;
van der wilt et al., 1992)] would serve to at least partially
circumvent the cytotoxic eect of the drug (berne et al., 1986).
in view of the importance of regulation of mrna in ts
production, a protocol was designed to reduce the cellular
levels of ts mrna through the use of speci®c antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides (odns). by choosing ts mrna as a
target to reduce the synthesis of ts protein, it is potentially
possible to: (a) inhibit cellular proliferation, a process
dependent on thymidylate availability; (b) enhance the
cytotoxicity of ts inhibitors by decreasing the amount of
protein target against which they act; and (c) inhibit ts
mrna translation and suppress the overexpression of ts in
drug-resistant cells.
a 422-base ts-antisense expression vector was shown to
down-regulate ts enzyme by inhibiting translation, thus
enhancing toxicity of  xxxd2117xxx  (ju et al., 1998). however, 18base phosphodiester odns antisense to various parts of the
ts mrna only transiently down-regulated ts, and after 24 h
led to a 2 fold increase in ts with a resultant resistance to 5fudr (ju et al., 1998). however, preliminary results from this
laboratory using stable phosphorothioester odns suggested
that down-regulation of ts was possible. the transfection
eciency of odns would also be expected to be much higher
than that of an expression vector, enabling sensitization of
many more (if not all) cells.
the use of antisense odns has proven to be a speci®c
method to down-regulate a number of desired targets (bennett,
1998; citro et al., 1998; dean et al., 1994a; 1996). antisense
odns are most commonly directed against short, speci®c
mrna sequences, resulting in a variety of biochemical
consequences. when antisense odns associate with mrna
the complex becomes a substrate for rnase h, resulting in
cleavage of the mrna (bennett, 1998; binder et al., 1994;
stein et al., 1988). in addition, odns associated with the
mrna tss prevent the normal processing of mrna by
ribosomes, at least in vitro (bennett, 1998). however, the 3',
untranslated region (utr) of mrna is often a superior target
for down-regulation compared with the 5'-region and/or the
tss (stein & cheng, 1993). phosphorothioated odns are
more stable than their phosphodiester counterparts, and are
degraded less rapidly by s1 and p1 nucleases (dean et al.,
1996; shaw et al., 1991; stein & cheng, 1993; stein et al.,
1988). because antisense odns can be made highly speci®c to
a target of choice, they provide a promising approach to
modulation of many cellular targets and biochemical
processes. we report here that a 20-base odn (odn 83),
complementary to a sequence in the ts mrna 3' utr,
transiently down-regulated the level of ts mrna and protein
in hela cells, inhibited cell proliferation, and enhanced the
cytotoxicity of ts-directed chemotherapy drugs.

materials and methods
oligonucleotides
fully phosphorothioated 20-base oligonucleotides were
synthesized by isis pharmaceuticals (carlsbad, ca, u.s.a.),
as described (dean et al., 1996). the six nucleotides on either
end of the oligomer were methoxyethoxylated in the 2'position, enhancing hybridization as well as resistance to
exonucleation (dean et al., 1994a,b). the middle eight
nucleotides were not methoxyethoxylated to allow rnase h
endonucleation and degradation of mrna hybridized to the

antisense enhancement of anti-ts drug toxicity

oligomer (dean et al., 1994b). odn 83 is complementary to
ts mrna, starting from a position 136 bases downstream of
the translational stop site (5'-gccagtggcaacatccttaa-3'). odn 32 is a randomized sequence of odn 83 (5'atgcgccaacggttcctaaa-3'), with the same base
constituents in random order. a search of available mrna
sequences using the ncbi blast search tool revealed that
odn 83 had sequences of ten or more complementary bases to
only human ts mrna, while odn 32 had sequences of ten or
more complementary bases to no known mrnas.

radioisotopes
[6-3h]5-dump (speci®c activity 18.6 ci mmol71) was purchased from moravek biochemicals (brea, ca, u.s.a.). this
isotope was 99.98% pure upon initial production, with a
degradation rate of 0.5 ± 1% per month at 7208c, and was
used within 3 months of manufacture. [a32p]-dctp (speci®c
activity 3000 ci mmol71) was purchased from amersham
pharmacia biotech (oakville, ontario, canada).

chemotherapy reagents
 xxxd3077xxx  was generously provided by zeneca pharmaceuticals, inc. (maccles®eld, cheshire, u.k.). doxorubicin was a
gift from adria laboratories (mississauga, canada).  xxxd2117xxx 
was purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo,
u.s.a.). 5-fu and irinotecan ( xxxd2383xxx ) (pharmacia & upjohn,
inc.),  xxxd1665xxx  and  xxxd2562xxx  (glaxo wellcome, inc.),
and cisplatin and paclitaxel (bristol-myers squibb co.) were
purchased from the london regional cancer centre
pharmacy.

other supplies
cell culture chemicals and nutrients were obtained from
canadian life technologies (gibco/brl) (burlington, on,
canada). all other chemicals were obtained from commercial
sources. plasticware was purchased from vwr canlab
(mississauga, on, canada) and fisher scienti®c (uniondale,
on, canada).

cell culture
cell lines human cervical carcinoma hela cells were maintained in dulbecco's modi®ed eagle's medium (d-mem) plus
10% foetal bovine serum and penicillin (50 units ml71)/streptomycin (50 mg ml71) (growth medium). cultures were incubated in a humidi®ed atmosphere of 5% co2 at 378c.
rapidly proliferating cells were utilized for establishing cultures of experimental cells, which were allowed to plate overnight prior to manipulation.
transfection of odns transfection was performed using
lipofectamine1 (lfa) (gibco/brl), a polycationic liposome formulation. cells to be used for proliferation
experiments were plated at a starting cell number of between
0.6 and 16105 cells per 25-cm2 tissue culture ¯ask, and lfa
was used at 3 mg ml71. for cells in 75-cm2 ¯asks, to be
harvested and extracted for assay of mrna or ts content, the
starting cell number was approximately 8 ± 106105, and the
lfa concentration was 4 mg ml71. prior to transfection,
adherent hela cells were washed once with phosphatebuered saline (0.15 m nacl+ 0.67 mm kh2po4, ph 7.4)
(pbs) and then treated with antisense or scrambled control
odn (50 nm) in the appropriate concentration of lfa in

p.j. ferguson et al

serum-free d-mem, at 378c for 6.0 h. the cells were then
washed once with pbs and cultured in the presence of growth

medium. they were harvested for rna isolation, ts protein
binding assay, and cell number measurement (by numeration
with a particle counter [coulter electronics, hialeah, fl,
u.s.a.]) at 1 ± 6 days following odn transfection. proliferation was assessed as the increase in cell number at various
times, as a percentage of the increase in cells treated with lfa
in the absence of odns.
cytotoxicity assays cells treated with both odns and
cytotoxic agents were ®rst exposed to anti-ts odn or control
odn, and then to cytotoxic agent 24 h later. drug exposure
was initiated by addition of 0.2-volume of growth medium
containing the agent at six times the ®nal concentration. at the
time of addition of drug or treatment with ionizing radiation,
and after 4 days of incubation, cell numbers were determined
in three separate ¯asks by enumerating with a particle counter
or, alternatively, by lysing cells in 0.1% sodium dodecyl
sulphate and measuring absorbance at 260 nm by ultraviolet
spectrophotometry: absorbance was proportional to, and an
indicator of, cell number. the proliferation of drug-treated
cells (fold-increase in cell number) was calculated in two ways:
(1) as a percentage of that of the control cells treated with lfa
plus odn only, to observe the eect of odn on drug
sensitivity isolated from the eect of odn plus lfa alone on
proliferation (figure 5), and (2) as a percentage of that of
control cells untreated with odn, lfa, or cytotoxic drug, to
observe the combined eect of odn as a single agent on cell
proliferation plus its eect on sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs.
ic50 and ic90 values (concentrations of drug that inhibited
proliferation by 50 and 90%, respectively) were determined by
interpolation of plotted data.
ionizing radiation treatment hela cells, in sealed tissue
culture ¯asks containing growth medium under normal
atmospheric oxygen, were treated with g radiation using a
60
co source (theratron eldorado 6) at a dose rate of
160 cgy min71. exposure times were from 0 to 10 min.
control cells were left in the exposure chamber for 10 min
with the radiation source sealed o. flasks were returned to
co2 incubators immediately following radiation.

reverse transcriptase ± polymerase chain reaction
(rt ± pcr) to measure ts mrna
measurement of ts and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) mrna in the same odn-transfected
cell populations at 1 ± 4 days post-transfection required a
method that would allow accurate quantitation of mrnas
isolated from the small numbers of cells available 1 ± 2 days
after transfection. therefore, rna was isolated from
transfected cells using trizol1 (gibco/brl). complementary dna was synthesized from 1 mg of total rna using
200 u of moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (gibco/brl) (in mm): tris-hcl (ph 8.3) 50, kcl
75, mgcl2 3, mixed dntp 1, 100 pmol random primers and
10 mm dithiothreitol at 378c for 1 h. the enzyme was
inactivated at 958c for 5 min. the resulting cdnas (in a
volume of 2.5 ml) were ampli®ed by pcr using 1.25 u of taq
dna polymerase in 50 ml of (mm) tris-hcl (ph 8.4) 20, kcl
50, mgcl2 2, mixed dntp 0.2, and 50 pmol of primers speci®c
for ts and  xxxg861xxx  cdnas. ts and  xxxg861xxx  cdnas were
ampli®ed together in the same reaction tube so that the level of
housekeeping  xxxg861xxx  cdna could be used to determine the
relative level of ts mrna. twenty-four to 27 cycles of pcr
ampli®cation (948c, 45 s; 558c, 30 s; 728c, 90 s) produced
fragments of 208 bp and 752 bp using primer sets for ts
(forward 5'-cacactttgggagatgcaca-3'; reverse 5'ctttgaaagcaccctaaacagccat-3') and  xxxg861xxx 
(forward 5'-tattgggcgcctggtcacca-3'; reverse 5'ccaccttcttgatgtcatca-3'), respectively. pcr products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and transferred to
hybond nylon membrane (amersham pharmacia biotech) by
southern blotting (sambrook et al., 1989). blots were
hybridized (church & gilbert, 1984) to [a-32p]-dctp random
primer-labelled probe: pchts-1 [a generous gift from dr k.
takeishi, university of shizuoka, shizuoka, japan (takeishi
et al., 1985)]; or a cdna insert recognizing  xxxg861xxx 
(denhardt, 1992). hybridization signals were quantitated
using a phosphorimager and imagequant (molecular
dynamics, sunnyvale, ca, u.s.a.).

antisense enhancement of anti-ts drug toxicity

the assay was performed using cells that were treated with
antisense odn 83 or the scrambled control odn 32.
brie¯y, cells were harvested by scraping into pbs and
resuspending the subsequent pellet in 100 mm kh2po4
(ph 7.4). cells were disrupted by freezing and thawing,
followed by sonication. the total protein concentration was
determined using coomassie staining (biorad reagent)
(bradford, 1976) in order to express results as pmol 5fdump bound per mg total protein. fdump binding was
assessed in lysates from cells transfected with odn 83 or
odn 32, extracted at the times indicated post-transfection.
extracts from three sets of transfections were assayed a total
of ®ve times, and pairs (e.g., odn 83 versus odn 32 on
day 1) were always assessed together under the same
reaction conditions. on each occasion, the incubation vessel
contained 50 mg of total protein, 75 mm me- xxxd3334xxx , 100 mm
 xxxd26xxx , 50 mm kh2po4 (ph 7.4), and 15 nm
[6-3h]-5-fdump in a ®nal volume of 200 ml. after 30 min
at 378c, the incubation was stopped by addition of 5
volumes of albumin-coated, acidi®ed charcoal. after 10 min
(room temperature), this slurry was centrifuged (30006g,

ts binding assay
cellular content of ts was assayed by binding of [6-3h]-5fdump, as described previously (spears & gustavsson,
1988). this method labelled total ts unless the cells were
pretreated with 5-fu or  xxxd2117xxx  (chu et al., 1990), and
correlated well with an in situ activity assay (ju et al., 1998).

figure 3 treatment of hela cells with odn 83 leads to decreased
ts mrna levels. hela cells were transfected with odn 83 or
scrambled control odn 32, or treated with lfa alone (lf) as
described in material and methods. cells were harvested at 1, 2, and
4 days post-transfection and total cellular rna isolated, reversetranscribed, and ts and  xxxg861xxx  cdna ampli®ed by 24 pcr cycles,
in the same reaction vessel. ts (208 b.p.) and  xxxg861xxx  (752 b.p.)
rt ± pcr products were con®rmed by southern blotting and
hybridization to speci®c radioactively-labelled probes.

figure 4 ts protein levels (inferred by measurements of 5-fdump
binding) are diminished by antisense ts odn 83 but not scrambled
control odn 32. 5-fdump binding was measured in cells
transfected with odn 83 (hatched bars) or odn 32 (open bars) at
dierent times following transfection. (a) results are plotted as a per
cent of 5-fdump binding in cells transfected with control odn
32+s.e. (n=5). the values for odn 32 (n=5) were normalized to
100% and are shown without error bars. (b) results are plotted as
pmol 5-fdump bound per mg total protein (61073) to reveal that
transfection with control odn 32 had no signi®cant eect on ts
protein levels. error bars indicate s.e.mean calculated according to a
student t-test, and indicate error due to dierences in experimental
conditions in four measurements taken on dierent days, as well as
dierences due to transfection with dierent odns. the asterisks
indicate signi®cant dierences (p40.02) according to a paired
student t-test, which controls for dierences in experimental
conditions.

concentrations of 5-fu (a),  xxxd2117xxx  (b),  xxxd3077xxx  (c), cisplatin (d) or  xxxd1665xxx  (e) for 4 days, beginning 24 h after

mean+standard error or standard deviation as determined by
student t-test. for determinations of fdump binding,
dierences between paired samples from cells transfected with
dierent odns were assessed using a paired t-test. this
controlled for dierences in experimental conditions on each of
the ®ve occasions that fdump binding was assessed. in all
cases, signi®cance was chosen a priori to be indicated by

from one independent experiment of two performed (figure 3)
revealed that ts mrna levels were lower in cells transfected

results
growth inhibition by odn 83
the primary objective of the study was to determine whether
an antisense odn targeted against ts could alter human
tumour cell proliferation and/or enhance the cytotoxicity of
ts-directed drugs. as a necessary preliminary investigation,
various combinations of diering cell density, lfa concentration, and odn concentration were evaluated to determine
optimal conditions. the selected conditions induced minimal
non-speci®c toxicity due to the transfection conditions alone
(lfa plus scrambled control antisense odn 32, 50 nm).
these transfection conditions allowed us to observe the eect
of odn 83 alone, or odn 83 plus cytotoxic drug, on cell
proliferation. the optimal conditions to measure odninduced alterations in hela cell proliferation were 50 nm
odn in 3 mg ml71 lfa, at a starting cell density of between
0.6 and 16105 cells per 25-cm2 ¯ask. under these conditions,
transient transfection of a b-galactosidase expression vector
revealed that greater than 50% of cells successfully took up
vector and synthesized active b-galactosidase enzyme. because
the modi®ed, single-stranded odns used in this study enter
cells more eectively than large, double-stranded dna vectors
(dean et al., 1996), this is likely a low estimate of transfection
eciency of odns 83 and 32.
hela cells treated with antisense ts odn 83 grew
signi®cantly more slowly than cells transfected with scrambled
control odn 32. compared to cells treated with lfa alone,
scrambled control odn 32 had no signi®cant eect on cell
growth at concentrations as high as 100 nm, at two dierent
lfa concentrations (figure 1a and b). in contrast, antisense
ts odn 83 reduced proliferation by a maximum of 20% at
2 mg ml71 lfa (figure 1a), and nearly 100% at 4 mg ml71
lfa (figure 1b). because 4 mg ml71 lfa alone aected cell
viability non-speci®cally (data not shown), we assessed the
eect of 50 nm odn 83 or 32 plus 3 mg ml71 lfa on cell
proliferation. compared to untreated cells, control odn 32
plus lfa had no eect, while antisense ts odn 83 decreased
proliferation by approximately 50% at 5 days post transfection
(figure 1c, representative data from one of 16 experiments).
growth inhibition was most evident in the ®rst 48 h following
odn 83 transfection, with growth rate returning to the same
level seen in cells transfected with control odn 32 in the 48 ±
144 h period following transfection (figure 2). this early
inhibition translated to a signi®cant dierence in cell number
at the end of 5 or 6 days. there was no evidence of enhanced
cell death (decreased cell number) in the odn 83-treated cells
compared with cells treated with control odn 32.

eect of odn 83 on ts mrna and protein
to determine whether inhibition of proliferation was due to a
direct eect of the antisense oligomer on its intended target, ts
mrna levels (relative to  xxxg861xxx  mrna) were measured by
rt ± pcr at various times following hela cell transfection

figure 6 overall eect of antisense ts odn 83 on cell proliferation
in the absence or presence of 5-fu,  xxxd2117xxx , and  xxxd3077xxx . as
described in the legend to figure 5, hela cells were transfected with
odn 83 or control odn 32, and then continuously exposed to
various concentrations of 5-fu (a),  xxxd2117xxx  (b), or  xxxd3077xxx  (c)
for 4 days, beginning 24 h after transfection. data points indicate the
number of cells (mean+s.e. of four independent cultures) at the 4

with odn 83 than in cells transfected with control odn 32.
antisense odn 83 treatment reduced the ts: xxxg861xxx  ratio,
at 24 h, to 30% of that seen in cells transfected with control
odn 32, rising to 57% at 48 h, and 64% at 96 h following
transfection (as measured by phosphorimage analysis of
southern-blotted pcr products). the rise in ts mrna levels
over time was in agreement with the recovery in proliferation
seen over time following transfection with odn 83 (figure 2).
therefore, transfection of hela cells with antisense ts odn
83 decreased ts mrna levels, relative to  xxxg861xxx  mrna, at
1 ± 4 days following odn transfection.
antisense down-regulation of ts mrna was re¯ected in
decreased ts protein levels. as measured by [3h]-5-fdump
binding, transfection with odn 83 reduced ts protein to
approximately 25% of the level seen in control cells within
24 h, followed by a gradual recovery in ts levels up to
approximately 80% of control levels by 4 days posttransfection (figure 4). the fdump-binding assay was chosen
in preference to another method (tritium release assay) to
assess ts activity, as the latter assay yielded inconsistent
results in cells with known high and low ts activity (results not
shown). the fdump-binding assay employed here potentially
measures enzymatically inactive ts, thereby, if anything,
underestimating the eect of the odn.

eect of odn 83 on cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs
 xxxd3077xxx  is a potent inhibitor of ts activity and cell
proliferation and is active in the nanomolar range (keyomarsi
et al., 1993). it is transported into cells by the reduced folate
transporter and polyglutamated, resulting in extended retention by cells (mcguire et al., 1997). treatment of hela cells
with antisense ts odn 83 sensitized the cells to the cytotoxic
eect of  xxxd3077xxx , added to cells 24 h post-transfection, as
demonstrated in a representative dose-response assay (figure
5). the proliferation rates shown re¯ect the eect of the drug
alone, since cells treated with odn 83 or odn 32 were
assigned a proliferation value of 100% and all data points
showing proliferation in the presence of drug after odn
treatment are relative to that 100% value. therefore, the data
presented in figure 5 and table 1 indicate odn enhancement
of drug toxicity, and do not include the growth inhibitory
eect of odn 83 shown in figures 1 and 2. in summarizing

antisense enhancement of anti-ts drug toxicity

1783

the results of multiple experiments, odn 83 treatment
enhanced sensitivity to 5-fu by between 40% (at 8 mm 5-fu)
and 67% (at 1 ± 2 mm 5-fu), and sensitivity to  xxxd2117xxx  (the
active metabolite of 5-fu) by between 10% (at 8 nm  xxxd2117xxx )
and 73% (at 4 nm  xxxd2117xxx ). in other terms, odn 83 reduced
the ic50 of  xxxd2117xxx  by approximately 70% (table 1 and data
not shown), and the ic90 by approximately 66%. cellular
resistance to  xxxd3077xxx  was also reduced by odn 83, albeit to
a lesser degree. among six separate experiments, the mean
reduction in the ic50 of  xxxd3077xxx  was 44+7% (s.e.mean). the
enhancement of sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs was separate
from, and additional to, the cytostatic eect of odn 83 alone
(all values in figure 5 and table 1 are relative to values
obtained from cells transfected with odn alone, without
added cytotoxic drug). in contrast, odn 83 did not sensitize
hela cells to the toxic eects of cisplatin or  xxxd1665xxx ,
neither of which is known to target the ts complex (figure 5).
further experiments to test the capacity of odn 83 to
enhance, in hela cells, the toxicity of a variety of agents acting
through dierent mechanisms (table 1) con®rmed and
extended the data shown in figure 5. there was no signi®cant
dierence in the capacity of  xxxd2383xxx  (a topoisomerase i
inhibitor), doxorubicin (a  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor),  xxxd2562xxx  (an  xxxd3249xxx ), paclitaxel (a tubulin-targeting
agent), or ionizing radiation (a generator of reactive oxygen
and other radical species) to inhibit the growth of hela cells
transfected with control odn 32 or antisense ts odn 83
(table 1). in this separate series of experiments, the eect of
ts-targeting agents ( xxxd2117xxx ,  xxxd3077xxx ), but not other drugs,
was enhanced by antisense ts odn 83, similar to the data
shown in figure 5.
data shown in figures 1 and 2 revealed the capacity of
odn 83 to exert a cytostatic eect in the absence of cytotoxic
drugs, and data in figure 5 and table 1 indicate an additional
capacity of odn 83 to enhance the ability of cytotoxic drugs
to inhibit cell proliferation. to visualize the overall inhibition
of cell proliferation caused by the combination of treatments,
proliferation of cells treated with odn 83 or 32 followed by
cytotoxic drug treatment was plotted as a percentage of
proliferation of cells not treated with drug or odn (figure 6).

discussion
natural eukaryotic antisense transcripts have been demonstrated to modulate the function of speci®c mrnas through
interactions that inhibit rna splicing, transport, and
translation, and enhance speci®c mrna degradation (knee
& murphy, 1997). antisense expression vectors and odns
introduced experimentally into cells act in a similar fashion to
speci®cally down-regulate a wide variety of gene products
(citro et al., 1998; dean et al., 1994a; 1996; denhardt, 1992; li
et al., 1997; woolf et al., 1992). although antisense expression
vectors can be very speci®c for the target against which they
are directed, and reduce speci®c protein levels by up to 90%,
the use of this technology in vivo may be limited by the low
transfection rate usually associated with such treatments.
however, speci®c odns, 15 ± 21 bases in length, have been
reported to be taken up very eciently into tissues in mice
untreated with transfection-enhancing agents (dean et al.,
1994a; 1996).
an optimal length of 15 ± 21 nucleotides for phosphorothioated odns has been demonstrated to balance speci®city
of targeting and cellular accumulation (bennett, 1998). many
eective antisense odns target regions at or near the tss, or
in the 3' utr, while those targeting the coding region tend to

1784

p.j. ferguson et al

be least eective (dean et al., 1994b). binding of odns to the
tss is believed to block translation (bennett, 1998; dean et al.,
1994b), while hybridization with the 3' utr may initiate
degradation of the entire mrna (binder et al., 1994). we
found that a 20-mer odn (odn 83) antisense to the 3' utr
of ts mrna speci®cally down-regulated ts expression, and,
when used as a single agent, inhibited hela cell proliferation.
a scrambled control odn (odn 32) had no eect on ts
expression or cell proliferation. in addition, odn 83 enhanced
cell sensitivity to  xxxd3077xxx , 5-fu, and  xxxd2117xxx , compared to
cells treated with the control odn. sensitivity to drugs that do
not target ts (cisplatin,  xxxd1665xxx ,  xxxd2562xxx , doxorubicin, ionizing radiation, paclitaxel,  xxxd2383xxx ) was unaected,
indicating that toxicity enhancement was a speci®c response.
down-regulation of other speci®c gene products using
antisense odns targeted to 3' utrs of mrnas has been
reported. a phosphorothioated 20-mer antisense to the 3'
utr of protein kinase c-a mrna speci®cally inhibits
expression of that isozyme, both in vitro and in vivo (dean et
al., 1994a; 1996). in mice, this antisense odn inhibited
proliferation of human xenografts at doses not toxic to the
animal (dean et al., 1994a; 1996). with respect to altering drug
sensitivity, an antisense odn directed against c-myc was
synergistic with cisplatin in treating human melanoma
xenografts in nude mice (citro et al., 1998).
the most important step in natural regulation of ts
expression is at the mrna translational level. in synchronized mcf-7 breast tumour cells, the half-life of ts protein
is 5 ± 8 h, ¯uctuating 4 ± 9 fold throughout the cell cycle, even
though ts mrna levels remain unchanged over the course
of three cell cycles (keyomarsi et al., 1993). ts regulates
translation of its own mrna by binding to the 5'-utr
(kaneda et al., 1987). although antisense odns targeted to
this mrna region may block translation (bennett, 1998;
dean et al., 1994b), it is also suspected that such odns may
bind to ts itself, at the polynucleotide binding site (ju et al.,
1998). this could relieve the repression of translation, as an
antisense odn targeted to the tss of ts mrna increased
the cellular level of ts protein after 24 h (ju et al., 1998). a
tss-targeted antisense nucleic acid can also have other eects
on ts expression, including induction of ts gene transcription (demoor et al., 1998). in light of the potentially
antagonistic responses which accompany the intended
suppression of ts expression by antisense odns targeted
to the tss region, it is more appropriate to target the 3'
region of the mrna.
although the eect of odn 83 treatment in enhancing drug
cytotoxicity was assessed relative to the toxicity of the drug in
odn 32-treated cells, it was formally possible that the
enhancement of cytotoxicity was a result of a pleiotropic,
non-speci®c eect of odn 83. in this scenario, the observed
down-regulation of ts could be due to a non-speci®c
inhibition of cell proliferation that results only secondarily in
down-regulation of ts expression (assuming that ts expression is diminished in cells with lower proliferation levels).
however, we observed that odn 83 transfection inhibited
proliferation for the ®rst 48 h following transfection, but
proliferation recovered to control levels thereafter (figure 2).
in 3-day post-transfected cells the level of ts was still less than
75% of the controls, indicating that ts was down-regulated in
response to odn 83 even under conditions of high cell
proliferation. in addition, ts :  xxxg861xxx  mrna ratios in cells
treated with lfa alone or lfa plus control odn 32 were
essentially the same, while lfa plus antisense odn 83
appreciably reduced the ts :  xxxg861xxx  ratio (figure 3). these
results collectively indicate that: (a) the initial decrease in cell

antisense enhancement of anti-ts drug toxicity

proliferation was due to down-regulation of ts (and not vice
versa); and (b) the enhancement of drug cytotoxicity was due
to the decreased level of ts mrna and ts protein. in light of
the 5 ± 8-h t1/2 of ts protein in mcf-7 cells (keyomarsi et al.,
1993), a 100% inhibition of new ts synthesis would yield an
88 ± 97% decrease in ts levels 24 h following transfection.
therefore, the 70% decrease in ts protein caused by odn 83
indicates an eective inhibition of new ts synthesis. the
recovery of proliferation could have been due to deterioration
of the odn, although the phosphorothioated odns are
generally very stable (dean et al., 1994a; b; 1996; shaw et al.,
1991; stein & cheng, 1993; stein et al., 1988). the intracellular
odn concentration may be diluted by the proliferation of the
cells, and there is also the possibility that it slowly diuses out
of the cells into the odn-free medium. in animals, potential
problems with time-dependent loss of odn activity can be
ameliorated by using multiple (2-day) injections.
since the greatest eect of odn 83 on ts level was in the
®rst 48 h, subsequent drug treatments were conducted within
this time period. the enhanced cytotoxicity of 5-fu,  xxxd2117xxx ,
or  xxxd3077xxx , added 24 h following odn transfection (figure
5 and table 1), is in addition to the anti-proliferative activity
of odn 83 on its own (figures 1 and 2). therefore, the
combination of odn 83 with a ts-targeted cytotoxic drug has
even greater potential as a chemotherapy regimen (figure 6),
particularly if odn 83 can ultimately be directed preferentially
to tumour cells. for example, at a concentration of  xxxd2117xxx 
(4 nm) that inhibited proliferation by 40 ± 50% in the presence
of odn 32, pretreatment with 50 nm odn 83 decreased
proliferation by a combined total of 95% (figure 6). similarly,
proliferation of cells treated with 4 nm  xxxd3077xxx  was 39% of
control in cells pretreated with scrambled odn 32, but only
20% of control in cells pretreated with antisense ts odn 83.
these odn 83-dependent increases in inhibition of cell
proliferation by cytotoxic drugs could provide a basis for
signi®cant improvement of chemotherapy regimens.
binding of drug to ts relieves the repression of ts mrna
translation by causing dissociation of ts from the tss of the
mrna (chu & allegra, 1996a; chu et al., 1991). human
mammary epithelial tumour cells treated with  xxxd3077xxx  or
other ts-targeted drugs in vitro exhibit a transient 10 ± 40 fold
increase in ts production, half of it in the ®rst 2 h following
exposure to the drug (keyomarsi et al., 1993). this druginduced increase in ts protein (chu et al., 1990; 1991; 1993a;
keyomarsi et al., 1993; van der wilt et al., 1992) has been
observed to enhance resistance to 5-fu therapy in mice (van
der wilt et al., 1992), and has been reported following
treatment with ts-targeted chemotherapeutics in cancer
patients (peters et al., 1994; swain et al., 1989). it is an
important confounding phenomenon to be considered in
designing human treatment protocols (berne et al., 1986; chu
& allegra, 1996a; chu et al., 1990; 1991; 1993a; keyomarsi &
moran, 1988; peters et al., 1994; swain et al., 1989; van der
wilt et al., 1992). an antisense odn (such as odn 83)
targeted to ts mrna could potentially play an important role
in preventing drug-induced derepression of ts mrna
translation in vivo.
an issue arising from these data is the lack of eect of odn
83 on the action of s phase-speci®c agents (for example, cpt11 and paclitaxel) which depend upon cellular proliferation
rate for toxic eect. it might be predicted that the decreased
proliferation following odn 83 exposure would enhance
resistance to these agents, at least during the ®rst 48 h
following odn transfection. we observed a trend toward
increased resistance to  xxxd2383xxx  (table 1), and experiments are
under way to investigate this possibility.

p.j. ferguson et al

this report demonstrates the ability to use an antisense
odn to down-regulate a speci®c enzyme resulting in
enhancement of cytotoxicity of a drug directed against that
enzyme. a ts antisense expression vector was shown by ju et
al. (1998) to down-regulate ts protein and ts activity in kb31
cells, enhancing sensitivity of the cells to 5-fu by 5 fold. in the
present report, we demonstrate that down-regulation of ts
mrna and subsequently ts protein using an odn antisense
to a sequence in the 3' utr can inhibit cell proliferation when

used alone, and can sensitize cells to ts-targeted chemotherapy drugs. the eects of odn 83 on human tumour growth
and drug sensitivity in vivo in immune-de®cient mice are
currently being investigated.
