may also reduce myocardial no-reflow. in addition,
suppression of  xxxd83xxx -sensitive k + (katp)

introduction

reflow. no-reflow has been associated with severe
myocardial injury, progressive left ventricular remodeling,
congestive heart failure and poor prognosis [5–7].

primary angioplasty and thrombolysis have become the
most important reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial
infarction (ami) with the aim of the timely restoration of
the epicardial blood flow and also the complete restoration of myocardial tissue perfusion. myocardial tissue
perfusion is even more important and has been suggested
to serve as a target of reperfusion therapy for ami [1].
studies have shown, however, that despite complete
restoration of epicardial vessel blood flow, myocardial
tissue perfusion evaluated with myocardial contrast
echocardiography (mce) remains incomplete, with even
no perfusion – known as slow flow or no-reflow
phenomenon [2,3] – accounting for 37% [4] of the
patients with a first anterior ami after receiving coronary

the mechanism responsible for the no-reflow phenomenon is uncertain and is likely multifactorial. although it
has been suggested that plugging of capillaries by
leukocytes and platelet activation contribute to no-reflow
[8,9], these blood cell elements are not necessary for the
development of this phenomenon, because no-reflow has
been observed in buffer-perfused hearts as well [10,11].
as demonstrated in animal models of coronary artery
occlusion and reperfusion, localized endothelial swelling
and protrusions are predominantly confined to the
capillary bed [12], indicating that the endothelium plays

an important role in tissue-level perfusion. notably, both
the  xxxg36xxx  inhibitor (acei) and
the  xxxg99xxx  receptor blocker (arb) have been
shown to have beneficial effects on the endothelium
[13–16]; we hypothesized that they may also be effective
in preventing myocardial no-reflow. in addition, the
suppression of  xxxd83xxx -sensitive k +
(katp) channel opening during ischemia and reperfusion
is an important mechanism for myocardial no-reflow [17].
it is not known whether the beneficial effects of acei
and arb are partly due to the activation of  xxxg1253xxx 
provided they can reduce myocardial no-reflow. therefore, in this study, we used a mini-swine model of ami
and reperfusion developed in our laboratory to compare
the effects of acei fosinopril with those of arb  xxxd3487xxx 
on myocardial no-reflow and the  xxxg1253xxx .

materials and methods
animal preparation

the mini swine (30 ± 3 kg) were anesthetized and
ventilated with a respirator (siemens-elema sv 900, solna,
sweden). a middle thoracotomy was performed, and the
heart was suspended in a pericardial cradle. the middle
and distal portions of the left anterior descending coronary
artery (lad) were dissected free from surrounding tissue
and encircled by a suture. the two ends of the suture were
threaded through a length of plastic tubing, forming a
snare, which could be tightened to achieve coronary artery
occlusion. the right femoral artery and vein were
cannulated for hemodynamic monitoring and contrast
agent injection, respectively. an ultrasonic flow probe
was placed proximal to the site of occlusion. the probe
was connected to a flowmeter (nikon kohden corporation, tokyo, japan) for digital measurement of lad flow.
experimental protocol

fifty-six animals were randomized into seven study
groups: eight controls, eight in  xxxd2215xxx  (katp
channel blocker)-treated, eight in fosinopril-pretreated,
eight in fosinopril and  xxxd2215xxx -pretreated, eight in
 xxxd3487xxx -pretreated, eight in  xxxd3487xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx -pretreated and eight in sham-operated. in the
animals treated with  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx 
(0.3 mg/kg) was administered 30 min before coronary
occlusion. in the fosinopril-pretreated animals, 1 mg/kg/
day of fosinopril (donated by sino-america squibb
company, shanghai, china) was given 3 days before
protocol. in the  xxxd3487xxx -pretreated animals, 2 mg/kg/day
of  xxxd3487xxx  (donated by novartis pharmaceutical company, east hanover, new jersey, usa), based on body
surface area, was given 3 days before protocol. in the
animals treated with a combination of fosinopril or
 xxxd3487xxx  with  xxxd2215xxx , 1 mg/kg/day of fosinopril
or 2 mg/kg/day of  xxxd3487xxx  was also given 3 days before
protocol, combined with  xxxd2215xxx  (0.3 mg/kg)
administered 30 min before coronary occlusion. the
above six groups were subjected to 3 h of coronary

occlusion, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. in the shamoperated animals, lad was only encircled by a suture,
but not occluded. data were collected at baseline, at the
end of 3 h of lad occlusion and at 2 h of reperfusion.
hemodynamics

at baseline, at the end of 3 h of lad occlusion and at 2 h
of reperfusion, left ventricular systolic pressure (lvsp),
left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (lvedp), the
maximum change rate of left ventricular pressure rise
and fall ( ± dp/dtmax ) and cardiac output (co) were
measured. coronary blood flow volume (cbv) was
measured at baseline, immediately after release of
occlusion (3 h) and at 2 h of reperfusion.
myocardial contrast echocardiography evaluation

echocardiography was performed with the hp 5500
machine (philips ultrasound, bothell, washington, usa).
the transducer was fixed in position to obtain the same
short-axis images of the left ventricle at the mid-papillary
muscle level. a warm-water bath acted as an acoustic
interface between the heart and the transducer. a bolus of
0.05 ml/kg of sonovue (bracco inc., geneva, switzerland)
was injected intravenously as a slow bolus for 30 s followed
by a 5-ml saline flush. data were collected at baseline, at
the end of 3 h of lad occlusion and at 2 h of reperfusion,
respectively. for each mce, end-systolic images were
acquired at a pulsing interval of four cardiac cycles during
contrast injection to allow complete beam replenishment,
and demarcation between perfused and non-perfused
tissue. the myocardial ligation area (la) and the area of
no-reflow (anr) were identified as the region of
unopacified myocardium by mce at 3 h of lad occlusion
and at 2 h of reperfusion, respectively. la, anr and left
ventricular wall area (lvwa) were traced and measured.
la was expressed as a percentage of lvwa, whereas anr
was expressed as a percentage of la.
histopathological evaluation

after completion of the experimental protocol, anr was
delineated by intra-atrial injection of 1 ml/kg of the
fluorescent dye thioflavin s (sigma chemical co.,
st louis, missouri, usa). the lad was then reoccluded
and evans blue dye was injected into the left atrium to
determine la. the swine was then euthanized and the
heart explanted. five lv slices were cut parallel to the
atrioventricular groove and incubated in a 1% solution of
triphenyltetrazolium chloride for 15 min at 371c. under
an ultraviolet light in a dark room, the areas not perfused
by thioflavin s were identified. la was defined as the
region unstained by evans blue, while anr was defined
as the non-fluorescent area within la. regions that failed
to demonstrate red staining were considered to represent
the necrosis area (na). the outlines of the lvwa, la,
anr and na were calculated. la was expressed as a
percentage of the lvwa, and anr and na as
percentages of la. samples were then taken from the

western blot analysis for  xxxg20xxx , kir6.1 and  xxxg1250xxx  in
myocardial tissue

myocardial tissue samples were separately suspended in
5 ml of ice-cooled lysis buffer containing (in mmol/l) trishcl 20 (ph 7.4), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 1, nacl
150, dithiothreitol 1, 2- xxxd26xxx  10 and freshly
added proteinase inhibitor and disrupted by using a tissue
homogenizer. the particulate material was discarded by
centrifuging at 100 000 g at 41c for 1 h. the clear
supernatant of each tissue sample was collected and
frozen at – 701c until use. protein concentration was
determined by the method of bradford [18], using bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as a standard. total protein (50 mg)
solubilized for 10 min at 1001c was loaded per lane onto
a 12% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. electrophoresis was performed for 1 h at 150 ma.
proteins were transferred onto immobilon-p transfer
membrane (millipore, bedford, massachusetts, usa) for
1.5 h at 0.8 ma/cm2 in a 20% methanol-containing cathode
buffer. the membrane was washed three times for 20 min
in pbst (0.1% tween 20, 100 mmol/l tris-hcl, 150 mmol/
l nacl, ph 7.5), blocked for 1 h in 5% non-fat milk-ttbs
and incubated with the primary antibodies for  xxxg20xxx ,
kir6.1 and  xxxg1250xxx  (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz,
california, usa). the primary antibodies were used in a
1:1000 dilution in pbst. after washing three times in
pbst for 15 min, the membrane was incubated with a
1:10 000 dilution of the secondary antibodies for 30 min at
room temperature. to measure protein levels, the western
blots were scanned and digitized on an optical scanner
(epson gt-8000, seiko, tokyo, japan). quantification of
western blots was done on a computer using the gel-pro
image analysis system (media cybernetics, silver spring,
maryland, usa). all specific values of proteins were
standardized to the value of protein in the sham group.
statistical methods

data are expressed as mean ± sd. comparisons of data
among all stages were carried out using repeatedmeasures analysis of variance followed by the student–

no-reflow and infarct size

in the control group, the coronary la was similar on both
mce in vivo and pathological evaluation (p > 0.05), and
the anr was also similar, on both as high as 78.5 and
82.3%, respectively, with the final na reaching 99% of la.
compared with the control group, anr in the
 xxxd2215xxx -treated group was significantly increased
to 90.2–93.5% (p < 0.05), with the final na reaching 99%
of la (p > 0.05). anrs on both mce and pathological
evaluation in the fosinopril-pretreated and valsartanpretreated groups were significantly decreased to 24.5–
25.2 and 24.3–24.9%, respectively (all p < 0.01), with the
final na of pathological evaluation also being significantly
decreased to 88.9 and 89.1% of la (both p < 0.05). no
significant difference in anr and na was observed
between the fosinopril-pretreated and  xxxd3487xxx -pretreated
groups (p > 0.05) or between the two co-treated groups
and the  xxxd2215xxx -treated group (p > 0.05) (table 1).
coronary blood flow volume

in the control group, cbv significantly declined to 50.6
and 45.8% of the baseline, immediately after release at
3 h of occlusion and at 2 h of reperfusion (both p < 0.01).
no significant difference in cbv was noted among the
 xxxd2215xxx -treated group, the two co-treated groups
and the control group (p > 0.05).
in the fosinopril-pretreated group, cbv was also
significantly declined immediately after release at 3 h of
occlusion and at 2 h of reperfusion (both p < 0.05),
although it significantly increased to 69.1 and 72.1% of
the baseline, which are both significantly higher than
those in the control group (both p < 0.01).

discussion
a large body of evidence has accumulated over the past
two decades to support the notion that  xxxg99xxx 
through its  xxxg100xxx  mediates a large array of biologic
activity. taken together, such effects promote atherosclerosis and progressive cardiac disease. the view is
further supported by the protection afforded by acei in
patients with cardiovascular disease [19,20]. the development of agents that block the  xxxg100xxx  (arb) has
been promoted as providing more complete attenuation
of  xxxg99xxx  action, particularly because alternative
non-ace pathways such as chymases and endopeptidases
can generate  xxxg99xxx  as well [21,22]. even though
acei and arb most likely provide comparable cardiovascular protection in high-risk populations with cardiac

the present study demonstrated that fosinopril and
 xxxd3487xxx  decreased the area of no-reflow and improved
cbv. although the beneficial effects of acei on the
microvasculature have also been suggested, previous
studies have used only indirect assessment, such as
improvement in coronary flow. for example, wagner et al.
[23] observed a significantly higher rate of timi
(thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) grades 2 and 3 of
the infarct-related artery in patients receiving oral ramipril
than in the placebo group (73 versus 54%; p = 0.035).
podesser et al. [24] demonstrated that acute ace
inhibition by  xxxd3063xxx  given during  xxxd2988xxx  arrest
improves coronary perfusion in failing rat hearts. our data
are the first to directly establish that pretreatment with
acei or arb exerts a favorable effect on capillary
perfusion after restoration of flow in epicardial vessels.
the mechanism by which acei and arb are beneficial in
the prevention of the no-reflow is unclear. our study
provides one possible mechanism for the beneficial effect
of pretreatment with acei or arb on myocardial noreflow. the suppression of the  xxxg1253xxx  opening is
an important mechanism for myocardial no-reflow. our
findings showed that myocardial tissue levels of  xxxg20xxx 
and  xxxg1250xxx  have a significant decrease in the reflow and
no-reflow myocardium compared with those in the nonischemic myocardium, suggesting that the  xxxg1253xxx 
was suppressed in the reflow and no-reflow myocardium.
fosinopril and  xxxd3487xxx  increased the  xxxg20xxx  and  xxxg1250xxx 
levels, indicating that they can activate the  xxxg1253xxx .
furthermore, administering  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxg1253xxx 
blocker) before myocardial ischemia abrogated the
protective effect of fosinopril and  xxxd3487xxx , also suggesting that they reduce myocardial no-reflow by the
activation of the  xxxg1253xxx . as activation of the katp
channel is a crucial step in mediating ischemic preconditioning [25,26], acei and arb may trigger
ischemic preconditioning.
our study also showed that na was 99% la in a miniswine model of ami (3 h) and reperfusion, while
fosinopril and  xxxd3487xxx  decreased na to 88.9 and
89.1%, respectively, which is similar to the values
reported by podesser et al. [24], jugdutt and sawicki
[27] and sawicki et al. [28]. the mechanism of fosinopril
and  xxxd3487xxx  in reducing infarct size is not well defined
and may be explained by (1) preventing myocardial noreflow, (2) improved vascular auto-regulation by means of
preserved endothelial function or (3) a direct vasodilatory
effect.
our study showed that lvsp, ± dp/dtmax and co
significantly declined (p < 0.05–0.01), while lvedp
significantly increased at the end of 3 h of lad occlusion

(p < 0.01) and ± dp/dtmax significantly declined further
(both p < 0.05) at 2 h of reperfusion. our study also
showed that both fosinopril and  xxxd3487xxx  improved
ventricular function after reperfusion, which is consistent
with the reports of jugdutt and sawicki [27] and sawicki
et al. [28]. the beneficial effects of the two agents on
ventricular function were the result not only of decreasing myocardial necrosis but also of preserving microvascular integrity and improving myocardial tissue
perfusion during ami and reperfusion.
a significant body of clinical research and experimental
study within the past decade established important
prognostic implications of the occurrence and extent of
no-reflow for recovery of regional myocardial function,
left ventricular remodeling, and clinical outcome.
evidence also from randomized, placebo-controlled mortality trials suggests that aceis or arbs have a favorable
impact on ventricular remodeling, improvement in
hemodynamics and reductions in congestive heart failure
from ami [29–31]. we believe these beneficial effects
are mediated at least in part by a reduction of myocardial
no-reflow. therefore, patients under treatment with
acei or arb for indications such as hypertension and
ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction may
also attenuate myocardial no-reflow and consequently
improve outcome when suffering from an ami.

study limitations

several limitations of this study exist. the results were
observed in an acute experiment setting, and no longterm data are available. as we administered fosinopril or
 xxxd3487xxx , respectively, the effect of combined use of
acei and arb on myocardial no-reflow was not known.
ideally, a continuous infusion of contrast should have
been used to ensure constant contrast concentrations in
the blood throughout each examination. we, however,
used a slow bolus injection, which was continued until all
images had been acquired in that view and thus were able
to maintain relatively stable contrast concentrations
during the image acquisition period. in the present
study, the contrast images are acquired at the pulsing
interval of the fourth cardiac cycle. it is possible that
longer triggering intervals may allow for better assessment [32,33]. as all animals were evaluated in the same
way, however, the comparative result will not be affected.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that
pretreatment with acei or arb markedly attenuated
myocardial no-reflow, while  xxxd2215xxx  abrogated the
protective effect of fosinopril and  xxxd3487xxx , suggesting
this beneficial effect was partly due to activation of the
 xxxg1253xxx .
