background: although all first-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists demonstrate efficacy in preventing
acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv), effective prevention of delayed cinv has not yet
been achieved. this study compared the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2834xxx , a novel, second-generation
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist, with ondansetron.
patients and methods: in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, phase iii study, 570 adult
cancer patients were randomized to receive a single i.v. dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg or
ondansetron 32 mg, each administered 30 min before initiation of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. the
primary end point was the proportion of patients with no emetic episodes and no rescue medication [complete
response (cr)] during the 24 h after chemotherapy administration (acute period). secondary end points
included efficacy in treatment of delayed cinv (≤5 days post-chemotherapy) and overall tolerability.
results: 563 patients were evaluable for efficacy. cr rates were significantly higher (p <0.01) for  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg than ondansetron during the acute (0–24 h) (81.0% versus 68.6%, respectively), delayed (24–120 h)
(74.1% versus 55.1%) and overall (0–120 h) (69.3% versus 50.3%) periods. cr rates achieved with  xxxd2834xxx 
0.75 mg were numerically higher but not statistically different from ondansetron during all three time intervals.
both treatments were well tolerated.
conclusions: a single i.v. dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg was significantly superior to i.v. ondansetron 32 mg
in the prevention of acute and delayed cinv.

introduction
four selective 5-ht3 (serotonin-3) receptor antagonists are available
for use in north america and/or europe for the prevention of
acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv):  xxxd1924xxx , ondansetron, granisetron and  xxxd3451xxx . although these
agents have some pharmacological differences in  xxxg1116xxx 
binding affinity, selectivity and metabolism, these minor variations have not resulted in clinically meaningful differences in
efficacy amongst them. therefore, according to current evidencebased and consensus guidelines, these  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists

are equivalent with regard to efficacy and are therapeutically
interchangeable when used at equipotent doses [1–4].
all first-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists demonstrate
considerable efficacy in preventing acute cinv [5], with acute
response rates as single agents ranging from 50% to 70% [6]. the
effectiveness of the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists as single agents in
preventing delayed cinv is less well established, with a proportion of patients who receive these agents continuing to experience
nausea and vomiting after receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy [7–11]. therefore, the development of new
agents with the potential to more effectively prevent cinv is
warranted. of interest is whether distinct, major pharmacological
differences in a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist would produce meaningful improvements over a currently available  xxxg1116xxx

patients and methods
patient selection
eligible patients were ≥18 years of age with histologically or cytologically
confirmed malignant disease, either chemotherapy naïve or non-naïve (having
experienced a maximum of mild nausea previously) and scheduled to receive
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. the inclusion/exclusion criteria can be
summarized as follows: patients who were scheduled to receive chemotherapy
with any dose of carboplatin,  xxxd2008xxx ,  xxxd2320xxx , ifosfamide, irinotecan or
mitoxantrone; methotrexate >250 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide <1500 mg/m2;
doxorubicin >25 mg/m2; or cisplatin <50 mg/m2 (infused over 1–4 h). patients
with hepatic, renal or cardiovascular impairment were enrolled at the investigator’s discretion. patients were excluded if they were unable to understand or
cooperate with study procedures. other exclusion criteria were as follows: the
taking of any drug with antiemetic activity within 24 h prior to treatment until
day 5 (including corticosteroids); evidence of seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsants (unless clinically stable with no seizure activity); vomiting, retching
or national cancer institute (nci) common toxicity criteria grade 2 or 3
nausea in the 24 h preceding chemotherapy; or were scheduled for radiation of
upper abdomen or cranium on days 2–6.

study design and treatment regimen
this multicenter, phase iii, randomized, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority
study was conducted in 58 european centers (germany, italy, uk, the
netherlands and russia) from 1 august 2000 to 2 october 2001. on day 1,
eligible patients were randomized using the trialine® interactive voice system
to receive a single i.v. dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg
(each  xxxd2834xxx  dose was infused over 30 s) or ondansetron 32 mg infused
over 15 min, administered 30 min before the first dose of moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy. patients were stratified at randomization by gender and prior
chemotherapy experience. for the study to remain blind, a double-dummy
technique was used. no patient received pretreatment with corticosteroids.
after the start of chemotherapy, rescue medication was permitted at the investigator’s discretion. the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at
each participating site and the study was conducted according to the declaration of helsinki. all patients gave written informed consent.

efficacy parameters
the primary end point of the study was the proportion of patients achieving a
complete response (cr; defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue
medication) during the first 24 h following chemotherapy administration
(i.e. efficacy in preventing acute cinv). an emetic episode was defined as one
episode of vomiting or a sequence of episodes in very close succession not
relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1 min; any number of unproductive
emetic episodes (retches) in any given 5 min period; or an episode of retching
lasting <5 min combined with vomiting not relieved by a period of relaxation
of at least 1 min. secondary end points included the following: the proportion
of patients achieving a cr during the delayed 24–120-h time period and the
cumulative overall 0–120-h time period, as well as cr rates during successive
24-h time periods (i.e. 24–48, 48–72, 72–96, 96–120 h); the proportion of
patients achieving complete control (cc; defined as no emetic episode, no
need for rescue medication and no more than mild nausea) for the 0–24,
24–120 and 0–120 h intervals; number of emetic episodes daily and cumulatively for the 24–120 and 0–120 h intervals; time to first emetic episode; severity
of nausea measured daily for the 0–120 h interval by a four-point likert scale
(used in previous studies to evaluate patient perceptions of cancer treatmentrelated side-effects) [21–23]; time to administration and need for rescue medication; time to treatment failure (first emetic episode or first need of rescue
medication, whichever occurred first); patient global satisfaction with
antiemetic therapy, as measured by a visual analog scale (vas) daily for
the 0–120-h interval; and quality of life (qol), measured via a modified
functional living index—emesis (flie) questionnaire, which specifically
addresses the impact of nausea and emesis on daily functioning, for the first
24 h and the standard flie for the 24–96-h interval.

study visits and evaluation procedures
consenting patients were initially screened for eligibility within 7 days prior to
study commencement. during this time period the following were recorded:
physical examination; vital signs and weight; laboratory tests [complete blood
count (cbc) with differential, platelet counts, blood chemistry and urine
analysis]; past medical history; concomitant medications; and history of nausea
and vomiting. follow-up included clinic visits on day 2 (at 24–30 h post-chemotherapy) and once between days 6 and 8. follow-up, via the telephone,
occurred on days 5 and 15. all subjects were followed for a total of 15 days.
patient diaries were used to record the following: emetic episodes; use of rescue
medication; patient global satisfaction; and severity of nausea, which was
evaluated daily until day 5 via a four-point likert scale ranging from 0 (none)
to 3 (severe).
safety was assessed by the following: adverse event (ae) reporting for a
period of 15 days (30 days for serious aes); vital sign measurements; laboratory
tests performed 24 h and 1 week after study drug administration (including
hematology, blood chemistry, liver function tests and urine analysis); physical
examination; and electrocardiogram (ecg) recordings performed 24 h and
1 week after study drug administration. a subset of patients (total, n = 49;
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg group, n = 20;  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg group, n = 15;
ondansetron 32 mg group, n = 14) had an additional ecg evaluation 15 min
after study drug administration (around the peak of plasma concentrations),
according to study protocol.

statistical analysis and sample size calculation
the primary efficacy hypothesis of the study was that at least one dose of  xxxd2834xxx  was non-inferior to the ondansetron dose using a maximum delta of
15% for cr at 24 h. the number of patients to be included in the study was
estimated to be 567, who were distributed into three groups (i.e. 189 patients/
group) based on the assumption of a responder rate of 70% in the  xxxd2834xxx 
and ondansetron groups and a difference of ≤15% in the cr rate. for a onesided test of equivalence (alpha = 0.0125), a sample size of 180 evaluable patients

antagonist in controlling cinv in patients receiving emetogenic
chemotherapy.
 xxxd2834xxx  is a highly potent, selective, second-generation
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist with a  xxxg1116xxx  binding affinity
that is ∼100-fold higher than other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
(pki 10.5 compared with 8.91 for granisetron, 8.81 for  xxxd3451xxx ,
8.39 for ondansetron, 7.6 for  xxxd1924xxx ) [12–14].  xxxd2834xxx 
also has an extended plasma elimination half-life of ∼40 h [15],
significantly longer than others in its class (ondansetron, 4 h [16];
 xxxd3451xxx , 7.3 h [17];  xxxd1924xxx , 7.5 h [18]; granisetron, 8.9 h
[19]). a prior dose-ranging phase ii trial of  xxxd2834xxx  in
patients receiving highly-emetogenic chemotherapy identified 0.25
and 0.75 mg as minimal effective doses for phase iii investigation
[20]. the current phase iii, randomized, double-blind, stratified,
non-inferiority study was conducted with the main objective of
comparing the efficacy and tolerability of single, fixed, intravenous (i.v.) doses of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 and 0.75 mg with a
single i.v. dose of ondansetron 32 mg in the prevention of acute
and delayed cinv following administration of moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy.

per group was needed to ensure 80% power for each comparison (overall
power = 90%). assuming a 5% dropout rate, 189 patients per group needed to
be enrolled.
to demonstrate the non-inferiority of at least one dose of  xxxd2834xxx  to
ondansetron, the lower boundary of the two-sided 97.5% confidence intervals
(ci) for the difference ( xxxd2834xxx  minus ondansetron) between the proportion of patients achieving a cr during the first 24 h after chemotherapy administration was calculated and compared with the preset threshold (–15%
difference). subsequent analyses comparing cr rates between each  xxxd2834xxx  dose and ondansetron by means of fisher’s exact test were also conducted. the chi2 test was utilized to analyze cc rates and the proportion of
patients receiving rescue medication. number of emetic episodes, severity of
nausea, patient global satisfaction and qol assessments were compared
between treatment groups using the kruskal–wallis or wilcoxon tests. differences between treatment groups with respect to time to first emetic episode,
time to first administration of rescue medication and time to treatment failure
were analyzed using kaplan–meier estimates and the log-rank test.

changes in laboratory values with respect to toxicity grades were investigated for each time point within each group using the wilcoxon signed rank
test. all other safety parameters were analyzed descriptively, with ecg data
summarized highlighting differences from baseline values for quantitative
variables and frequencies of treatment-emergent abnormalities. shift tables
were used to evaluate categorical changes with respect to toxicity grades in
hematology and blood chemistry parameters. changes in laboratory values
with respect to nci-adapted toxicity grades were investigated within each
group using the wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. vital signs and physical
examination data were listed and summarized. ecg data were summarized
highlighting differences from the baseline values for quantitative variables and
the frequencies of treatment-emergent abnormalities. in particular, electrocardiographic intervals qt and qtc mean changes from baseline were calculated at each time point, including the maximum mean change from baseline.

results
patient characteristics and baseline demographics
demographic data and baseline characteristics for patients in the
itt cohort are presented in table 1. of the 570 patients randomized, seven did not receive study medication. therefore, a
total of 563 patients were evaluable for efficacy in the itt cohort.
of these patients, 562 were evaluable for safety. five patients
withdrew from the study: one in the  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg group
(patient’s decision), two in the  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg group (one,
patient’s decision; one, non-serious ae), and two in the ondansetron group (one, patient’s decision; one, serious ae). the percentages of patients with protocol violations were similar in the three
treatment groups, with the majority of violations (4.7%) in all

primary efficacy analysis
complete response: study day 1 (acute cinv). the proportion of
patients in the itt cohort achieving a cr during the first 24 h after
administration of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy is presented in table 2. non-inferiority of both doses of  xxxd2834xxx 
compared with ondansetron was demonstrated, as the lower
bounds of the 97.5% ci of the difference with ondansetron (1.8%
and –6.1%, respectively) were greater than the preset threshold of
–15% difference. moreover,  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg was statistically
significantly superior to ondansetron in preventing acute emesis
(lower bound of the 97.5% ci >0; p = 0.009).

secondary efficacy parameters
complete response: study days 2–5 (delayed cinv). for the
delayed (24–120 h) and overall (0–120 h) time periods, the proportion of patients achieving a cr was significantly greater for
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg compared with ondansetron (table 2). for
the daily assessments through study day 4 (96 h), cr rates were
significantly higher with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg than ondansetron.
 xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg was as effective as ondansetron at all time
points.
complete control: study days 1–5 (acute and delayed cinv).  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and 0.75 mg produced significantly higher cc
rates compared with ondansetron during the delayed (24–120 h)
interval (66.7% versus 50.3%; p = 0.001), and the overall (0–120 h)
interval (63.0% versus 44.9%; p = 0.001).  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg
was superior to ondansetron on study days 2 (p = 0.001), 3
(p = 0.001) and 4 (p = 0.003), with  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg superior
to ondansetron on study days 3 (p = 0.004) and 4 (p = 0.006). on
all other days, both  xxxd2834xxx  doses were as effective as
ondansetron.

time to treatment failure
time to treatment failure was significantly longer following treatment with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg than treatment with ondansetron
(p <0.001) (figure 1). although the median time to treatment failure (time to first emetic episode or first use of rescue medication,
whichever occurred first) was >120 h in all treatment groups, the
first quartile of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg showed a time to treatment
failure more than twice as long as that observed with ondansetron
(46.5 versus 19.5 h, respectively).

analysis of the primary end point was performed for the intention-to-treat
(itt) cohort (all randomized patients who received chemotherapy and study
drug) and the per-protocol (pp) cohort (all patients who completed study day 1
and who were compliant with the study protocol). results for the itt cohort
analysis were interpreted in a confirmatory manner, whereas results of
analyses performed for the pp cohort were only descriptive. all secondary
efficacy analyses were performed for the itt cohort and the results were interpreted in a descriptive manner. the proportion of patients achieving a cr at
further time points was examined using the same statistical methods as for the
primary efficacy variable. subgroup analyses were used to identify differences
in response based on gender and chemotherapeutic history. the equivalence of
the two  xxxd2834xxx  doses with respect to cr was also evaluated (alpha = 0.05).

treatment groups due to the taking of rescue medication before the
first emetic episode on study day 1.
the majority (72.1%) of patients evaluated were female,
caucasian (98.9%) and had received chemotherapy previously
(58.4%). the most common cancer type was breast cancer (57%
of patients), followed by lung (8%), bladder (5%), colon (4%),
rectal (3%), small-cell lung (3%) and gastric (3%) cancer. the
most common chemotherapeutic agents administered on study
day 1 (received by >10% of patients) were cyclophosphamide
(63%), doxorubicin (48%), cisplatin (18%), methotrexate (16%)
and carboplatin (12%). all three treatment groups were comparable regarding the type and dose of chemotherapy administered.
no patient received prophylactic corticosteroids.

additional secondary end points
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg was consistently superior to ondansetron
(p ≤0.05) in the number of emetic episodes [during the acute
(0–24 h), delayed (24–120 h) and overall (0–120 h) intervals, as
well as on study days 2 and 3], the proportion of patients with no
emetic episodes (study days 1–3 and delayed and overall intervals)
(figure 2) and the proportion of nausea-free patients (study days
3–5). for these same end points,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg was superior
to ondansetron on study day 3, delayed and overall intervals (% no
emesis), and study days 4–5 (% no nausea). only a few patients
required rescue medication during the delayed (24–120 h) period
( xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg, 15.9%;  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, 22.8%;
ondansetron, 24.3%) and during the overall (0–120 h) period
(18.5%, 23.8% and 27.0%, respectively) (p ≥0.05 for each study
day and during the cumulative delayed and overall study periods),
with metoclopramide used most frequently.
a subset analysis by gender showed a trend in males for higher
cr rates, higher cc rates, less severe nausea, longer time to treatment failure, longer time to first emetic episode and less rescue

medication compared with female patients. a subset analysis by
chemotherapeutic history showed that chemotherapy-naïve
patients tended to have less severe nausea than non-naïve patients.

adverse events
a total of 562 patients were evaluable for safety. of the patients in
the  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg and ondansetron
groups, 114 (61.0%), 125 (66.5%) and 120 (64.2%) experienced
at least one ae. most aes were mild in intensity, with the majority
(84%) assessed as associated with the patient’s cancer and/or
chemotherapy treatment and not related, or unlikely to be related,
to study medication. post hoc analysis revealed no differences in
the duration of aes commonly associated with  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist therapy (i.e. headache, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue)
in patients treated with  xxxd2834xxx  compared with ondansetron.
table 3 provides a list of treatment-emergent, drug-related aes.

discussion
conventional thinking regarding the activity of the available
5ht3 receptor antagonists is that they are all similar. the results
of this study suggest that  xxxd2834xxx ’s major pharmacological
differences may translate into improved control of cinv in
patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. in this
study, a single i.v. dose of  xxxd2834xxx  was superior to ondansetron in preventing acute cinv, as indicated by the cr rates and a
number of secondary efficacy assessments within the 24 h following chemotherapy administration. this advantage was observed
comparing  xxxd2834xxx  to the highest recommended i.v. dose of
ondansetron. cr rates observed in this study for ondansetron were
similar to those reported previously, with earlier studies reporting
cr rates ranging from 69% to 73% for acute emesis (following a
single dose) and 45% for delayed emesis (following multiple
doses) [24, 25]. the consistency of these cr rates with those
reported in the current study (69% for acute emesis, 50% for
delayed emesis) highlights the validity of the current study.
because the study drug was administered only on study day 1 as
a single i.v. dose, we were able to explore the rate of delayed
cinv and determine the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing
cinv during the 24–120-h period following administration of
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. our results showed the
superiority of  xxxd2834xxx  over ondansetron in preventing
delayed cinv, as measured by cr and cc rates, as well as with
respect to number of emetic episodes, per cent of patients with no
nausea and time to treatment failure. it should be noted that both
chemotherapy-naïve and non-naïve patients were included in this
study to provide a more realistic, heterogeneous patient group,
similar to that seen in the clinical setting.
superiority of  xxxd2834xxx  in the prevention of delayed cinv
has also been demonstrated in a similarly designed phase iii trial
of  xxxd2834xxx  and  xxxd1924xxx  in patients receiving moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy [26]. the observed sustained efficacy
of a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing delayed emesis is a
clinically important finding, as currently available  xxxg1116xxx 

antagonists do not demonstrate substantial efficacy in delayed
emesis, despite repeated dosing [9, 10, 27] and concomitant use
with corticosteroids [3]. the prolonged antiemetic efficacy of
 xxxd2834xxx  is possibly related to its high  xxxg1116xxx  binding
affinity and long plasma elimination half-life of approximately 40 h.
all treatments were well tolerated, with no significant differences between groups. most aes (including serious aes) were
assessed as unlikely to be related to study medication, but rather to
the patient’s underlying cancer or chemotherapeutic treatment.
consistent with previous studies of  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists,
headache was the most frequently reported drug-related ae
(i.e. adverse reaction) in all treatment groups [4, 28–30]. there
were no significant treatment-related changes in laboratory measures, vital signs or ecg. no safety concerns were raised in this
study.
doses of  xxxd2834xxx  chosen for investigation in this study
were based on a phase ii dose-finding study, which revealed  xxxd2834xxx  3.0 µg/kg (fixed dose of ∼0.25 mg) as the minimum
effective dose for preventing cinv after administration of highly
emetogenic chemotherapy, with doses up to 90 µg/kg (fixed dose
of ∼6.0 mg) also safe and effective [20]. findings from this phase
ii study supported the selection of 3.0 µg/kg and 10 µg/kg doses
(corresponding to fixed doses of ∼0.25 mg and ∼0.75 mg, respectively) for use in the current phase iii study. our results show that
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 and 0.75 mg are similar in overall efficacy, suggesting that the 0.25 mg dose can be found on the plateau of the
efficacy dose–response curve. the statistically non-significant
difference in efficacy between  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and 0.75 mg
is not unlike the results observed with other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists, such as  xxxd1924xxx  [28].
our results demonstrate that a single i.v. dose of  xxxd2834xxx 
results in prolonged protection against nausea and emesis following
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.  xxxd2834xxx  is superior
to ondansetron in preventing both acute and delayed cinv. thus,
 xxxd2834xxx , a novel second-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist,
would be a significant and important addition to antiemetic therapy.

parameters, vital sign measurements and ecg recordings, with no
pronounced differences in these parameters observed between
treatment groups. the mean post-dose change from baseline in
qtc (fridericia correction) was 1 ms for  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,
2 ms for  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg and 5 ms for ondansetron. overall,
no significant safety concerns were raised in this study.
