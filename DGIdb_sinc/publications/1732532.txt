structure-antigastrin activity relationships of new
(r)-4-benzamido-5-oxopentanoic
acid derivatives

rotta research laboratorium, 20052 monza, milan, italy. received april 26, 1991
new (r)-cbenzamid~50xopentanoic
acid derivatives were synthesized by a stereoconservative procedure and evaluated
in vitro for their capacity to inhibit the binding of [1251](bh)-cck-8to either rat peripheral ( xxxg352xxx ) or central
( xxxg353xxx ) cck receptors, or the binding of [3h]pentagastrinto rabbit gastric glands, as well as to inhibit, in vivo,
the acid secretion induced by  xxxd2873xxx  infusion in the perfused rat stomach. the parent compound of this series
(lorglumide) is the f i i t nonpeptidic, potent and selective antagonist of the  xxxg352xxx . chemical manipulations
of the structure of lorglumide led to the discovery of selective antagonists of the cck-blgastrin receptors.
structure-activity relationships are discussed. some of these new derivatives exhibit different affinities with rabbit
gastric gland cells and rat cortex membranes, suggesting that the stomach  xxxg353xxx  (arbitrarily termed cck-b1
receptor) is not as closely related to the cck central receptor (termed cck-b2) as previously hypothesized. the
antigastrin activity of the most potent compound of the series, le. (r)-4-(3,5-dichlorobenzamido)-5-(8-azaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)-5-oxopentanoic
acid (compound 28,cr 2194)was further evaluated in vivo: in the first hour after
administration the compound inhibits acid secretion induced by  xxxd2873xxx  infusion, in both cat and dog (in the
cat with gastric fistula and in the dog with heidenhain pouch), with id,s (mg/kg) of 15.5 (iv) (cat), 8.7 (iv) (dog)
and 24.2 (oral) (heidenhain dog). the characteristics of cr 2194,that is, the selectivity for the  xxxg353xxx ,
the simple nonpeptidic molecular structure, and the activity after oral administration, indicate that this compound
is a useful tool in the study of the biological effects of gastrin and a potential agent for diagnostic or therapeutic
use.

the gastrointestinal polypeptide hormones gastrin and
cholecystokinin (cck) are closely related chemically, both
having a common terminal pentapeptide amide sequence,
but they exhibit different biological effects on their target
tissues. for instance, in vivo, gastrin is a potent stimulant
of acid gastric secretion and a very weak stimulant of
pancreatic enzyme release,' while cck is the main hormonal regulator of gallbladder contractility and of pancreatic enzyme secretion.2 more recently it was demonstrated that cck is also widely distributed in the brain
and it was hypothesized that it may function as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous
system (cns).3s4 the peripheral actions of cck are
mediated by a receptor subtype termed  xxxg352xxx , while the
central actions are mainly mediated by the subtype receptor termed  xxxg353xxx , for which the minimum agonist
ligand requirement is tetragastrin (cck-4h5 a third
receptor subtype, which appears to be closely related to
the  xxxg353xxx  type, is the stomach  xxxg353xxx .6
d,l-4-[ (3,4-dichlorobenzoyl)amino]-5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxopentanoic acid (lorglumide, cr 1409) is the
fmt nonpeptidic, potent, competitive, and specific  xxxg352xxx 
antagonist, with low afffity with the  xxxg353xxx  receptor, and
is ineffective, even when administered in subtoxic doses,

new (r)-4-bentamido-5-oxopentanoicacid derivatives

exhibiting potent and selective antagonist activities on
 xxxg353xxx  and gastrin receptors.
chemistry
since it has been demonstrated that the cck-antagonist
activity of lorglumide is stereospecific and due essentially
to the r form,ll we have utilized in the synthesis of these
new derivatives a method (illustrated by scheme i) that
allows retention of the configuration of  xxxd2431xxx .
therefore n-cbz-y-benzylglutamic acid (d or l) is condensed with the amine of formula rih to obtain intermediate 63(a-y). the cbz and benzyl groups are removed
together by reacting 63 dissolved in methanol with hz
under room conditions in the presence of a catalytical
amount of palladium on charcoal. the resultant amino
acid 64(a-y) is then converted to the final product (1-62)
by acylation under schotten-baumann conditions with
equivalent quantities of the appropriate acyl chloride of
formula rzcoc1.
the physicochemical characteristics of the new 4benzamido-5-oxopentanoicacid derivatives are given in
table i.

results and discussion
the results obtained from binding and gastrin antagonism are presented in table 11.
initially we synthesized a homologous series of linear
(c4-c7) alkyl secondary amides of n-benzoyl-d-glutamic
acid, unsubstituted or with mono- and disubstituted chloro
derivatives of the aromatic ring (compounds 1-7). among
these derivatives the 3-chloro compound displayed the
highest anti-gastrin activity in vivo in the perfused rat
stomach (ed,, = 36 mg/kg), whereas, contrary to the sar
in the corresponding lorglumide cck-antagonists series,
the 3,4-dichloro substitution (compound 5) does not increase the activity over that of the unsubstituted aromatic
ring. the introduction in r1 of an alkyl branched substituent at a distance of not less than three carbon atoms
from the amidic nitrogen (compounds 8-19) increases the
antigastrinic activity in vivo.
among these compounds the best substitution was obtained when r1 was a (aminobutyl)-3,3-dimethylgroup and
rz was 3-chloro or 3,5-dichlorophenyl(compounds 10 and
12), both showing an edb0in vivo of 16 mg/kg.
it is worthy to note the complete loss of activity of
compound 20, carrying in r1 a branched chain only two
carbon atoms from the amidic nitrogen.
the introduction in r1 of secondary cyclic (c6-clo size)
amides (compounds 21-25) produces compounds with mild
antigastrin activity. in order to exclude the hypothesis that
the antigastrin activity of this series of 4-benzamido-5oxopentanoic acid derivatives is linked to the presence in
corl of a secondary amido group, a corl tertiary amide
was synthesized in which r1 was a 4,4-dimethylpiperidin-l-yl group and r2a 3-chlorophenyl group. this
compound also exhibited a mild anti-gastrin activity in vivo
(compound 26, ed5,, = 30 mg/kg).
because of this encouraging result, a series of cor1
tertiary amides was synthesized in which the amino group
was an azaspirobicyclo group consisting of not more than
10 carbon atoms and having a maximum length of about
6 a and a maximum width of about 3 a (compounds
27-49).

journal of medicinal chemistry, 1992, vol. 35, no. 1 29

the best anti-gastrin activity in vivo in this series of
derivatives is obtained when r1 is the 8-azaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl group (compounds 27-42) and among such compounds the compounds in which r2 is 3-chloro or 3,5-dichlorophenyl, showing an ed50 of 15 and 11 mg/kg, respectively (compounds 27 and 28). the introduction of
other halogen substituents in rz such as 2,3-dichloro,
3,4-dichloro, 3-br, or 3-cf3 groups is less favorable. the
same happens with the introduction in rz of alkyl or
alkoxy groups such as 3-me, 3,5-mez,3-et, 4-ipr, and 3och3 (compounds 31-35) as well as with the introduction
of bulky groups such as 2-naphthyl, 3-quinolinyl, and 2indolyl (compounds 40-42) or especially with the introduction of electron-withdrawinggroups such as 3-no2and
3-cn (compounds 36 and 37). less effective are also the
compounds in which r1 is the group 2-azaspiro[4.4]nonan-2-yl (compound 47), 2-azaspiro[4.5]decan-2-yl(compounds 48 and 49), or 3-azaspiro[5.5]undecan-3-yl(compounds 43-46).
good anti-gastrin activity in vivo is obtained when r1
is also a decahydroisoquinolin-2-ylgroup (compound 50)
or a l-(aminoethyl)-2-(l’-adamantyl)group (compounds
51 and 52) and in which r2 is a 3-chloro- or 3,5-dichlorophenyl group. however, the secondary corl amides in
which r1 is 3-aminospiro[5.5]undecaneor 2-aminodecahydronaphthalene (compounds 53-55) are all ineffective,
probably because the r1 group is, in this case, too bulky
or because the spatial arrangement of the r1 moiety is not
suitable for interaction with the hydrophobic receptor
surface.
as in the series of lorglumide  xxxg352xxx  antagonists, with
these new gastrin antagonists the activity is also stereospecific and attributable essentially to the r configuration.
in fact the s enantiomers (compounds 56-60) are all poorly
effective or ineffective in comparison with the corresponding r enantiomers (compounds 10,27-29, and 51).
the situation is different with regard to the affinity with
the peripheral  xxxg352xxx  (binding to the rat pancreatic acini). generally, the corl tertiary amides are
much more effective than the corresponding secondary
amides and higher activity is achieved when r1 is a 3azaspiro[5.5]decan-3-y1group and rz is a 3,4-dichlorophenyl, 2-naphthyl, or 3-quinolinyl group (compounds
44-46).
these compounds are in fact very effective, displaying
an ic50of 0.4-0.6 pm, that is about 10 times higher than
that exhibited by the two di-n-pentyl corl amides ( r ) lorglumide and cr 179512(compounds 61 and 62).
the most potent in vivo  xxxg353xxx  antagonists of the series, for example compounds 10,12,27,28, and 52, are, on
the other hand, very weak  xxxg352xxx  antagonists, all being
about 200-2000 times less potent than the specific  xxxg352xxx 
antagonist (r)-lorglumide.
with regard to the affinity with the central  xxxg353xxx 
receptor (binding to rat brain cortex) the situation is, once
again, different.
some of the most potent in vivo  xxxd2873xxx  antagonists, for example compounds 28 and 52, show a high affinity (ic,, = 0.6 and 0.3 nm,respectively) with the  xxxg353xxx 
receptor, but not higher than that exhibited by compound
45, which is inactive in vivo as an anti-gastrin, or by the
most potent  xxxg352xxx  antagonist of the lorglumide series,
i.e. compound 62, which is completely ineffective on the
same model in vivo. furthermore, compounds 10 and 12,

fective or totally ineffective in the inhibition of gastric
secretion, exhibit, as expected, only slight activity on this
in vitro model.
by examining the ratios a/b, and b,/b, of table i11
(the stomach  xxxg353xxx  and the cck central receptor are termed by us  xxxg353xxx , and  xxxg353xxx ,, respectively), it is possible to observe that compounds 10,12,27,
and 28 have the equivalent property of exhibiting 10-20
times higher affinity for the cck-bzcentral receptor in
comparison with the peripheral  xxxg352xxx , whereas
the affinity for the  xxxg353xxx , peripheral  xxxg353xxx  is
even higher than that for the central cck-b2, also with
the same order of magnitude.
conversely, compound 45 shows a high affinity for the
central cck-bp receptor as well as for the peripheral
 xxxg352xxx , whereas it is, as already stated, almost
ineffective in inhibiting gastrin binding to the  xxxg353xxx ,
peripheral  xxxg353xxx  (b1/b2 ratio is 115). furthermore the adamantyl derivatives 51 and 52, exhibit a
much higher affiiity with the  xxxg353xxx , receptor than that
displayed on inhibiting the binding on both  xxxg352xxx  and
 xxxd2873xxx   xxxg353xxx , peripheral receptors.
taken together, these results are further evidence of
what was already hypothesized by other^,'^ that at least
three receptor subtypea for the cck/gastrin system exist
and that the stomach  xxxg353xxx  ( xxxg353xxx ,) may not
be so closely related to the central  xxxg353xxx  (or cck-b2)
receptor as previously hypothesized.
the presence or the lack of a second c-5 straight alkyl
chain in corl seems to be, therefore, a major factor in
dwecting these 4-bemamido-5-oxopentanoicacid derivatives to antagonism with  xxxg352xxx  rather than  xxxg353xxx , or
cck-b2 receptors. the relative inactivity of (r)-lorglumide in inhibiting the  xxxd2873xxx  binding on the putative
 xxxg353xxx , recsptor, together with the lack of any anti-pastrin
activity in vivo, has led us to s u p p m that the 4-benzamido-5-oxodi-n-alkylpentanoicacid derivatives could
compete at the receptor site with the 26-28 cck moiety
rather than with the terminal pentapeptide (29-33) of
cck. on the other hand, the 4lmmmid~5-oxopentanoic
acid derivatives in which cor, is either a secondary amido
group having a bulky substituent not less than two unsubstituted carbon units from amido group or a tertiary
amido group of the optimum size of a bicyclo spiro group
are able to compete especially with the terminal pentapeptide sequence shared by both cck and gastrin. thii
speculation reflects the experimental results obtained with
the two series of pentanoic acid derivatives, i.e. the lor(13) cberner, j. k; sutliff, v. e.; grybwski, d. m.; jenaen, r. t.;
gardner. j. d. functionally distinct receptors for cholecystokinin and gastrin of dispersed chief cells from guinea pig

glumide series and this new  xxxg353xxx  antagonist series, but
evidently other explanations for such binding selectivities
are also poasible.
to further understand the structure-activity relationships between the terminal cck tetrapeptide (trp-metasp-phenh,) (c30-c33) and the 4-benzamido-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives cck/gastrin inhibitors, a computer-assisted conformational analysis was carried out in
order to determine the low-energy conformation of both
the agonist and its antagonists. for the paradigmatic
example the structure of compound 10 was fitted to the
low-energy structure for tetragastrin, taking the carboxylic
acid of both molecules as an anchor group and allowing
other groups of compound 10 to orient independently
within the space that the computer graphics gave a p
proximately as the beat superposition of the two st.ructurea
however, for both molecules the minimized structure energy, that is, 29.28 kcal/mol for compound 10 (coded cr
2093) and 60.23 kcal/mol for tetragastrin, was maintained.
as shown in figure 1,it seems that once we have fmed
the superposition of both carboxylic groups of the two
molecules and the superposition of the 3-chlo10benzamido
moiety of compound 10 with the region of space of terminal
phenylalaninamide group of tetragastrin, we can see that
the cor, 4,4-dimethylbutylamide side chainof 10 exhibits

as an additional anchor group for interaction with a second
hydrophobic region of the  xxxg353xxx . in contrast,
the superpositioning of (r)-lorglumide with cck(30-33)
by matching both the carboxyl group and the phenyl ring
of the two structures does not allow to successfully overlay
the residual hydrophobic moieties, i.e. the methionine and
n-pentyl groups (figure 2).
tovalidate the results of computer conformational
analysis, an x-ray structure study of compounds 10 and
(r)-lorglumide was performed. in figure 3 an arbitrary
projection of the molecule of compound 10 with the atomic
numbering scheme is shown.
a small deviation from planarity is present in the

from planarity (plane 111).

evaluation of its anti-gastrin activity in vivo on two other
animal species.
in dogs with chronic gastric fistulas, the compound was
given by iv bolus in a dose range of 5-30 mg/kg, against
a fixed submaximal stimulation of gastric acid secretion
induced by a 2-h iv infusion of  xxxd2873xxx  (3 pglkg per
h). compound 28 dose dependently antagonizes the gastric
acid output induced by  xxxd2873xxx  infusion, with an edm
of 8.7 mg/kg in the first hour after bolus administration
and an ed,,, of 28.8 mg/kg in the second hour.
from the above-mentioned results it seems likely that
compound 28 has the same antigastrin potency in both rat
and dog. in this connection, it is interesting to note that
the most potent nonpeptidic  xxxg353xxx  antagonist discovered
up to now (i.e. the benzodiazepine derivatives l-365,260)
was reported to be much less effective in the dog, that in
other tested animals species, such as the mouse, rat, and
guinea-pig? these results lead us to suppose a qualitative
difference between the two antigastrin series.
in the heidenhein pouch dog model, the compound,
given in a dose range of 10-40 mg/kg intragastrically, dose
dependently reduces the gastric acid output induced by
a 2-h iv infusion of 6 pg/kg per h of  xxxd2873xxx . at 40
mg/kg the reduction is about 70% in both the first and
second hour collection period after its oral administration.
the calculated id50are in this case 24.2 and 33.6 mg/kg,
respectively.
in cats with chronic gastric fistulas the compound exhibits the same pattern of activity as in the dog. under
a 2-h 6 pg/kg per h iv  xxxd2873xxx  stimulation, the gastric
acid output is reduced by 50% at the dose of 15 mg/kg
in the first hour after iv bolus and at the dose of 44 mg/kg
in the second hour collection period.
the results obtained are shown in figure 8 and in table
iv.

compound 28 (coded cr 2194) is the most potent
 xxxg353xxx  antagonist among the newly described class of

aliphatic sequences is noted. no significant deviation from
planarity is detected in the dichlorobenzoyl group (plane
i) nor in the c1, n1, 01, c17 (plane 11)and c6, 04, n2,
c2, (plane 111) groups. planes i and i1 form an angle of
69o while planes i1 and i11 form an angle of 97.4o.
in figure 6 part of the crystal packing of (r)-lorglumide
is shown, supporting the statement that disorder in the
alkylic sequences is due to the poor interaction between
these moieties and neighboring groups.
it is worthy to note that in the lorglumide structure the
carbon atoms (cll-cl6) of the two pentyl chains, which
are mainly in all-trans state, are about 9 a apart, so that
the overall shape of the molecule is strongly characterized
by the presence of three distinct hydrophobic moieties.
this seems to be the main difference with the molecular
structure of compound 10, in which the presence of only
two hydrophobic moieties of suitable dimensions, apart
from the carboxylic group, seems to be more favorable for
the interaction with the  xxxg353xxx .
compound 28 (figure 7), the most potent cck/gastrin

binding studies.  xxxg352xxx  binding assays were carried
out on rat pancreas by the collagenase method previously de5~ribed.l~briefly, tissue (about 5 g) was extensively minced and
dispersed in 30 vol of krebs-henseleit buffer (khb) (118 mm
 xxxg2020xxx ,25 mm nahc03, 4.7 mm kc1,1.2 mm nah2p04, 0.1 mm
cac12,14 mm glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml sbti 1% bsa) adjusted
to ph 7.4. to this medium, continuously shaken and gassed with
95% 02-5%co2, was added 0.5 mg/ml crude collagenase. the
resulting suspension was filtered with nylon mesh (320 pm),
layered over khb containing 4% bsa, 0.5 mm cac12,and 0.1
mg/ml sbti, and centrifuged for 5 min a t 13%. the final
resulting pellet was suspended in 10 vol of hepes-ringer ph 7.4
buffer (118mm nacl, 10 mm hepes, 1.13 mm mgc12, 1.28 mm
cac12,and 1% bsa). this preparation gave a final concentration
of 1-3 x lo7 cells/ml (assessed by light microscope with the aid
of a neuebauer chamber), which was diluted with binding assay
to about 5 x io6 cells/ml.
 xxxg353xxx  receptor binding aways were carried out on membranes
of rat cerebral cortex, as previously des~ribed.'~the tissue (about
800 mg) was homogenized in ice-cold 20 mm hepes (ph 6.5) and
centrifuged twice at 50000g. the washed final pellet was resuspended in 50 vol of binding away buffer (20 mm hepes, 5 mm
mgcl,, 360 mm  xxxg2020xxx ,15 mm kc1,l mm egta, and 0.2 mg/ml
bacitracin). protein concentration was determined by using the
method of bradford,'8 using bsa as the standard. this procedure
gave about 1pg of protein/pl.  xxxd2873xxx  (cck-b1) receptor
binding assays were carried out on isolated glands from the rabbit
gastric mucosa according to the method of berglindhlswith minor
modifications. briefly, the fundic mucosa was separated from
muscular and submucosal layers, weighed (ca. 6 g), and then
minced into small pieces and transferred to 50 ml of collagenase
solution (130 mm  xxxg2020xxx ,12 mm nahc03, 3 mm nah2p04, 3 mm
na2hp04,3 mm k2hp04,2 mm mgs04, 1mm cac12,10 mg/l
phenol red, 0.2% glucose, and 1% rabbit  xxxg124xxx , ph 7.4)
containing 1 mg/ml of collegenase.
the suspension was continuously gassed with 100% o2 at 37
"c, gently stirred for 20-25 min, and then filtered through nylon
mesh (320 pm). free cells were removed by gravity sedimentation
for 15 min and the glands were washed free from isolated cells
and collagenase three times with buffer binding solution (132 mm
 xxxg2020xxx ,5.4 mm kcl, 5 mm na2hp04,1 mm nah2p04, 1.2 mm
mgso,, 0.2% rabbit  xxxg124xxx , 0.2% glucose, and 0.5 mm
d?t, ph 7.4). this procedure gave about 7-8 ml of sedimentated
glands with 90% viability (trypan blue exclusion method). the
suspension was diluted in buffer binding to obtain about 375 mg
wet weight/ml.
binding conditions for both  xxxg352xxx  and cck-b2binding assays
were the same. cortical membranes or acini (400 pl), tracer
(55000 dpm/tube), and displacing agents were incubated in a
0.5-ml total volume in polypropylene tubes for 30 rnin a t 37 oc.

4-benzamido-5-oxopentanoicacid derivatives by its ability
to block  xxxd2873xxx -stimulated acid secretion in several
models. it has a simple nonpeptidic molecular structure
and it is pharmacologically effective even after oral administration. these properties indicate that this compound could be a useful tool in the study of the biological
effects of gastrin and a potential agent for diagnostic or
therapeutic uses in man.

rotation axes to be modified. the starting data set is minimized
using a function that randomly selects the rotation axes. during
the first part of the calculation, the “heaviest” rotation axes are
favored, next the “lightest” ones (second part), and finally the
“heaviest” ones again (third part). one hundred iteractions with
maximums or de less than 0.1 kcal/mol were performed for
optimization, according to newton-raphson.
crystal analysis of 10. a colorless crystal suitable for x-ray

(subnanomolar affinity) u ligands specific for the u receptor labeled by [3h]-(+)-3-ppp. when 3 was tested for
its capacity to displace [3h]-(+)-3-pppfrom guinea pig brain membranes, it exhibited a ki of 0.34 nm, which is
better than either of its parent compounds (-)-2 (ki= 1.3 nm) and (+)-2 (ki = 6.0 nm). other compounds related

to 3 such as n-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-n-methyl-2-(
nm ([3h]-(+)-3-ppp). the determinants for high u receptor affinity of 3 were examined by manipulation of this
structure in a number of different ways. the high efficacy of these compounds for the u receptor, their relative
chemical simplicity and ease of synthesis, and their high degree of selectivity identifies n-[ 2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-n-methyl-2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)ethylamine
(3) and related compounds as a highly promising base for
determination of the functional role of u receptors as well as the development of novel therapeutic agents.

introduction
u receptors have attracted much attention due to their
ability to bind with significant affinity a number of psychoactive compounds or compounds with other activities
(see ref 1for a review). among these are haloperidol and
other typical n e u r o l e p t i c ~the

phen~yclidine,~
the antitussive dextromethorphan,5 and
the steroid hormone progesterone.6 though many u ligands bind to other receptors, u sites are distinct from any
known neurotransmitter or  xxxg1603xxx . attempts
to define a functional role(s) for u sites have resulted in
its implication in several physiological and biochemical
processes. among these are (1)regulation of motor behavior and postural tone,’-9 (2) negative modulation of the
phosphoinositide response to muscarinic cholinergic
agonists,’+l2 (3) regulation of smooth muscle contraction,13-15and (4) neuroprotective activity.16 the ability
of q ligands to affect motor systems and protect from
neuronal damage suggests that selective u compounds may
