abstract. a decade has passed since the first topical prostaglandin analog was prescribed to reduce
intraocular pressure (iop) for the treatment of glaucoma. now four prostaglandin analogs are
available for clinical use around the world and more are in development. the three most efficacious of
these drugs are  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , and  xxxd340xxx , and their effects on iop and aqueous humor
dynamics are similar. a consistent finding is a substantial increase in uveoscleral outflow and a less
consistent finding is an increase in trabecular outflow facility. aqueous flow appears to be slightly
stimulated as well. prostaglandin receptors and their associated mrnas have been located in the
trabecular meshwork, ciliary muscle, and sclera, providing evidence that endogenous prostaglandins
have a functional role in aqueous humor drainage. earlier evidence found that topical pg analogs
release endogenous prostaglandins. one well-studied mechanism for the enhancement of outflow by
prostaglandins is the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and remodeling of extracellular matrix.
other proposed mechanisms include widening of the connective tissue-filled spaces and changes in the
shape of cells. all of these mechanisms alter the permeability of tissues of the outflow pathways leading
to changes in outflow resistance and/or outflow rates. this review summarizes recent (since 2000)
animal and clinical studies of the effects of topical prostaglandin analogs on aqueous humor dynamics
and recent cellular and molecular studies designed to clarify the outflow effects. (surv ophthalmol

all of the clinically available drugs for the treatment
of elevated intraocular pressure (iop) have direct
effects on one or more parameters of aqueous
humor dynamics. iop usually is reduced by slowing
the production rate of aqueous humor, by decreasing the resistance to flow through the trabecular meshwork, by increasing drainage through the
uveoscleral outflow pathway, or by a combination of
these mechanisms. currently, the most effective
outflow drugs approved for clinical use are prostaglandin (pg) f2a analogs. these drugs reduce iop
by stimulation of aqueous humor drainage primarily

through the uveoscleral outflow pathway but significant effects on trabecular outflow facility also have
been reported.67,85 three  xxxd1902xxx  analogs ( xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , and  xxxd3414xxx ) are approved for
glaucoma therapy in the united states, one additional analog (unoprostone) is prescribed in japan
and a new analog ( xxxd3274xxx ) is in clinical trials in
japan.  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  are ester prodrugs of  xxxd1902xxx .  xxxd340xxx  is the amide prodrug
of 17-phenyl-pgf2a86 and has been classified
by some as a  xxxd340xxx ,86 although this classification has been somewhat controversial.7,37,56--58,86,87

unoprostone is an analog of a pulmonary metabolite of  xxxd1902xxx  and sometimes labeled a docosanoid.26
 xxxd3274xxx  is a difluoroprostaglandin derivative of
 xxxd1902xxx .62 agonists of dp, ep, and tp receptors have
been or are being investigated in animal models for
their iop efficacy and potential as new glaucoma
therapeutic drugs. none of these agonists has yet to
be approved for clinical use.
this review summarizes recent (since 2000)
animal and clinical english-language studies of the
effects of topical pg agonists on aqueous humor
dynamics and recent cellular and molecular studies
designed to clarify the outflow effects.

agonists butaprost44 and 8-iso pge223 (table 1).
exceptions do exist. one drop of 17-phenyl trinor 8iso pge2 and the selective  xxxg1875xxx  agonist 3,7dithia  xxxd124xxx  increased outflow facility sufficiently in
normotensive monkey eyes to account for most, if
not all of the iop reduction (kharlamb, arvo 2004
abstract 1035, table 1). an older study found an
increase in outflow facility at 4 hours after one
topical drop of  xxxd1902xxx .35
one potential reason for the apparent differences
in trabecular outflow facility effect among the
various pg agonists is the method of measurement.
two noninvasive methods, tonography and fluorophotometry, and two invasive methods, two-level
constant pressure perfusion and isotope accumulation, are used to make the assessment. all methods
measure trabecular outflow facility, but confounding factors are known to exist, including ocular
rigidity (a measure of eye stiffness), pseudofacility
(the facility of flow of aqueous humor from the
posterior to anterior chamber resulting from the
probe-induced increase in iop), and uveoscleral
outflow facility. the name of the measured variable
trabecular outflow facility is not entirely accurate
because of the inclusion of these other factors in
the various measurements. all of the measurement
techniques assume that uveoscleral outflow facility is
very small and affected little by the measurement
itself. this assumption is based on monkey studies8,68 reporting that uveoscleral outflow is relatively
pressure-independent. however, if an experimental
manipulation were to increase uveoscleral outflow
facility, this could be interpreted erroneously, as an
increase in trabecular outflow facility. it is thought
by some that pgs increase uveoscleral outflow
facility but this has yet to be proven experimentally.
these methods may not detect changes in trabecular outflow facility if the changes are overshadowed
by strong effects on uveoscleral outflow and/or
uveoscleral outflow facility.
the length of time of treatment could be another
factor contributing to the differing effects of pgs on
trabecular outflow facility. the immediate iop
effects that occur from a single dose of a pg analog
may be mediated by cellular mechanisms different
from those that occur after repeated applications or
continuous exposure.9,83,90 therefore, findings
from multiple doses of each pg should be compared before concluding that one pg analog acts
through mechanisms different from all others.
mice are being used with increasing frequency to
evaluate aqueous humor dynamics because of their
potential for genetic manipulation in addition to
their ocular similarities to humans. these animals
exhibit increases in outflow facility 2 hours after one
4-ml drop of  xxxd2446xxx .18 several limitations to

aqueous humor dynamics
 xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , and  xxxd340xxx  produce similar increases in uveoscleral outflow of
several-fold. increases in trabecular outflow facility
also have been reported but this finding has not
been found consistently (table 1). unoprostone,
the least efficacious of the four compounds, appears
to have little effect on uveoscleral outflow in
humans. rather it works mainly by increasing
trabecular outflow facility.69 the new fluoroprostaglandin f2a,  xxxd3274xxx , increases uveoscleral outflow
and aqueous flow in monkeys62 but has yet to be
studied in humans. earlier studies13,89 have reported that the topical pg analogs release endogenous prostaglandins that may contribute to the
observed ocular hypotensive effects.  xxxd3274xxx  in
mice reportedly works in part through fp receptormediated prostaglandin production acting through
the prostanoid  xxxg1874xxx .49 studies published
between 2000 and 2008 of fp, dp, and ep receptor
agonists and their effects on aqueous humor
dynamics in humans and nonhuman primates are
summarized in table 1. studies predating 2000 are
found in an earlier review.67
trabecular outflow facility

trabecular outflow facility is not always increased
following topical treatment with pg analogs but
evidence is building that the effect is real and not
unique to any one drug of this class.  xxxd2446xxx ,
 xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone all have
been found to significantly increase trabecular
outflow facility in at least one clinical study
(table 1).
compared to humans, the trabecular meshwork
of monkeys seems to be less affected by pg analogs.
trabecular outflow facility was unchanged following
multiple topical treatments of monkeys with pgf2aisopropyl ester,22  xxxd3274xxx ,62 and  xxxd3414xxx ,71 the

using this animal model should be mentioned. the
size of the eye makes accurate measurement
difficult. inflow and outflow are very slow (manyfold slower than in humans),1 and changes in flow
can be near the limit of detection. additionally, the
anesthesia needed for most measurements quickly
and profoundly affects iop.31 iops vary among
strains of mice,30 and aqueous humor outflow rates
may vary among strains as well. further research is
needed to characterize differences in aqueous
humor dynamics among the murine strains.

uveoscleral outflow

increases in uveoscleral outflow have been reported with topical treatment of  xxxd340xxx  and
 xxxd2446xxx  in ocular normotensive and hypertensive subjects (table 1).11,16,20,73  xxxd3414xxx  increased
uveoscleral outflow in monkeys71 and marginally
increased it in ocular hypertensive patients as well.70
unoprostone, the weakest of the four prescribed pg
analogs, is the only one that did not affect
uveoscleral outflow in humans despite 5 days of
twice-daily dosing.69
multiple topical drops of agonists for fp receptors
(tafluprost62), dp receptors (al-659872), and  xxxg1873xxx 
receptors (butaprost44 and 8-iso pge278) increased
uveoscleral outflow in monkeys (table 1). in
contrast, one drop of the  xxxg1875xxx  agonist 3,7-dithia
 xxxd124xxx  had no effect on uveoscleral outflow in
monkeys (kharlamb et al, unpublished data, abstract 1035 presented at the 2004 arvo annual
meeting). a multiple dose study is needed to clarify
whether the effect persists with repeat dosing.

aqueous flow

most studies investigating aqueous flow have
found that pg analogs produce a small (10--15%)
increase that may or may not be statistically
significant and is not clinically important. a
significant increase in aqueous flow was found at
night in young healthy japanese volunteers treated
with  xxxd2446xxx ,41 and during the day and at night
in healthy predominantly white volunteers treated
with  xxxd340xxx .11 additionally, aqueous flow increased during the day in monkeys treated with a dp
agonist.72 this effect does not contribute to any
reduction in iop but an increase in aqueous flow
could be considered a healthy side effect of topical
pg analogs because aqueous humor carries essential
nutrients and removes waste products, crucial for
keeping the avascular tissues of the anterior
segment healthy.

topical prostaglandins and aqueous humor dynamics
episcleral venous pressure

three studies have reported no change in
episcleral venous pressure in patients with ocular
hypertension treated for one week with  xxxd2446xxx ,
 xxxd3414xxx , or unoprostone (table 1). the measurements (made with a commercially available episcleral venomanometer, eyetech, morton grove, il),
are difficult to make with accuracy and consistency.
nevertheless, because no study found any trend to
suggest a change, it seems reasonable to conclude
that the pg effect on episcleral venous pressure is
minimal.

cellular and molecular studies
trabecular meshwork

organ-cultured anterior segments and trabecular
meshwork cell cultures provide strong evidence that
pg analogs can alter the resistance in trabecular
outflow (table 2). pgs have direct effects on matrix
metalloproteinases (mmps), neutral proteases that
initiate degradation of the extracellular matrix and
play a major role in regulating resistance to flow
through tissues. mmps are expressed by human
trabecular meshwork2 and directly control outflow
resistance in human organ-cultured anterior segments.9 the activity of mmps is regulated by tissue
inhibitors of metalloproteinases (timps).10 currently four timps (timp-1, -2, -3, -4) have been
identified in mammals and each timp targets
specific mmps.42 in one study,47 cultures of human
trabecular meshwork cells treated with  xxxd2446xxx 
acid for 24 hours had increased expression of mmps
-1, -3, -17, and -24 and timps -2, -3, and -4. a study6
of human organ-cultured anterior segments infused
with  xxxd2446xxx  acid found increased outflow
facility at 24 hours after administration when
compared to control anterior segments (67% vs
6%) but no changes in the amount of mmps or
scleral hydraulic conductivity.6 histological examination found regions of focal detachment and loss
of schlemm’s canal endothelial cells and extracellular matrix in some areas of the trabecular
meshwork.6 the focal cell loss was reasoned to be
due to cytoskeletal and focal adhesion changes6
because pgs in aortic smooth muscle cells cause
disassembly of actin stress fibers and inhibition of
phosphorylation of  xxxg1904xxx  and other focal adhesion proteins.12
 xxxd340xxx  increases outflow facility by 40% in
human organ-cultured anterior segments within 48
hours of treatment. this effect was blocked by
preincubation with agn211334, thought to be
a  xxxd340xxx -selective antagonist,76 or , alternatively,
an inhibitor of  xxxd340xxx  hydrolysis.7 similarly,

 xxxd3028xxx 

pig organ--cultured anterior segments perfused at
a constant pressure of 15 mm hg, showed increased
outflow by up to 62% at 8 hours after topical
administration of  xxxd340xxx  and by 30% at 5
hours after intracameral administration of  xxxd1902xxx .74
human trabecular meshwork monolayer cultures6
treated with  xxxd340xxx  had a 78% increase in
hydraulic conductivity which also was blocked by
agn211334.76
 xxxd124xxx  increases outflow facility by 26% in human
organ-cultured anterior segments.19 this effect
probably occurs by an adenylyl cyclase-dependent
pathway activated primarily by the predominant  xxxg1873xxx 
receptors in the trabecular meshwork.32 stimulation
of  xxxg1873xxx  receptors in trabecular meshwork is coupled
to the activation of high-conductance caþ2-activated
kþ channels (bk) which may contribute to the
relaxant activity of  xxxg1873xxx  agonists in isolated trabecular meshwork strips.61 however, outflow facility was
not stimulated and camp production was not
altered after short exposure periods with  xxxd1902xxx  or
placebo in human organ-cultured anterior
segments.19
prostaglandin receptors have been identified in
human trabecular meshwork tissue but a  xxxd340xxx 
receptor has not yet been cloned. the genes for all
prostanoid receptors are expressed in human
trabecular meshwork. gene expression for the  xxxg1873xxx 
receptor is most abundant, followed by fp, tp, ip,
and  xxxg1875xxx , with dp and ep3 at the lowest levels.32
immunofluorescent labeling of fp and ep prostanoid receptor subtypes in normal human trabecular
meshwork tissue showed positive staining for ep1 on
trabecular cells of the outer portion of the
meshwork and cells lining schlemm’s canal.  xxxg1873xxx 
was localized to the outer wall and periphery of
schlemm’s canal. ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  labeling was present
on trabecular cells along the entire meshwork.
moderate expression of  xxxg1878xxx  protein was
present in the outer portion of the trabecular
meshwork and endothelial cells of schlemm’s canal,
collector channels and aqueous veins.55
human trabecular meshwork cells in culture
express many of the same pg receptors as are found
in intact tissue. cultured trabecular meshwork cells
can produce pge2 and low levels of  xxxd1902xxx .83,84
additionally, fp receptors have been identified in
human trabecular meshwork cells as determined by
the presence of mrna, protein, and a functional
response (increased inositol phosphate accumulation and intracellular calcium release) to pgf2a5
and numerous synthetic fp-selective pg agonists.58
pge2 elicits its biological effects via four g-proteincoupled receptor subtypes which stimulate
phosphoinositide turnover with elevation in intracellular-free calcium (ep1 and some ep3), activation

topical prostaglandins and aqueous humor dynamics

of adenylyl cyclase and elevation of intracellular
camp ( xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx ) or inhibition of adenylyl
cyclase (ep3).17,43 prolonged treatment of human
trabecular meshwork cells with  xxxd2446xxx  or  xxxd1902xxx 
ethanolamide causes an increase in expression of
genes for insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) and
fibroleukin that could act to increase outflow
facility. igf-1 is reported to increase the level of
mmps, stromelysin, and gelatinase in trabecular
meshwork cells. the protease activity of fibroleukin
may be active against a component in the extracellular matrix.90
unoprostone free acid (uf-021) shows low
affinity for all prostanoid receptors and weak
functional responses via  xxxg1878xxx  activation.57
several molecular events have been associated with
unoprostone exposure. a reduction in the activity of
l-type ca2þ channels via a signal transduction
pathway was mediated by tyrosine kinases.65 activation of bk channels by unoprostone free acid
inhibited trabecular meshwork contraction leading
to an increase in outflow.66
 xxxg674xxx  is involved in regulating the contractility of the trabecular meshwork.  xxxg1878xxx 
agonists can block  xxxg674xxx  induced contractility of the trabecular meshwork. evidence indicates
this inhibition is mediated by the  xxxg1878xxx .64
uveoscleral tissues

immunohistochemistry studies of ep and fp
receptor localization in the uveoscleral tissue in
normal human donor eyes indicate the presence of
ep-1, -2, -3, -4 and fp receptors in the ciliary body
and sclera. fp receptors are most abundant in the
circular portion of the ciliary muscle.55
several mechanisms have been proposed to
explain the pg-induced increase in uveoscleral
outflow: remodeling of the extracellular matrix of
the ciliary muscle45,53,80 and sclera33,82 (molik et al,
unpublished data, abstract 406 presented at the
2006 arvo annual meeting) causing changes in the
permeability of these tissues; widening of the
connective tissue-filled spaces among the ciliary
muscle bundles,39,63 which may be caused in part
by relaxation of the ciliary muscle51,75 and changes
in the shape of ciliary muscle cells as a result of
alterations in actin and vinculin localization within
the cells.60
ciliary muscle relaxation has been suggested as
responsible for the initial reduction in iop from
topical pgs. this does not appear to be the case for
all pgs and their agonists.  xxxd124xxx  and pge2 relaxed
isolated monkey ciliary muscle strips precontracted
with carbachol88 but 3,7-dithia  xxxd124xxx  (kharlamb et
al, unpublished data, abstract 413 presented at the

 xxxd2715xxx 

2006 arvo annual meeting),  xxxd1902xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  did not.88
remodeling of the extracellular matrix within the
ciliary muscle and sclera is the most thoroughly
understood effect of pg treatment. dissolution of
collagen types i and iii within the connective tissuefilled spaces between the outer longitudinally
oriented muscle bundles39,63 results from pg-stimulated induction of enzymes  xxxg1418xxx , -2, and -3 in
the ciliary muscle and surrounding sclera. 25 longterm (1 year) unilateral treatment of monkey eyes
with topical  xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , sulprostone
(ep3/ep1 agonist) or ah13205 and butaprost ( xxxg1873xxx 
agonists) found that in all cases the tissue spaces of
the ciliary muscle were enlarged and organized into
elongated tube-like spaces, covered by endotheliallike cells often in contact with the basement
membrane, and contained myelinated nerve fiber
bundles.44,52 these fluid pathways resembled a kind
of lymphatic system described in the choroid.34
changes in the trabecular meshwork also were
present. mmp expression in human ciliary body
tissue and ciliary muscle cells was determined after
 xxxd2446xxx  acid treatment for 24 hours. the mrna
of  xxxg1418xxx , -2, -3, -11, -12, -14, -15, -16, -17, -19, and
-24 as well as timp-1 to -4 were found in ciliary body
tissue and ciliary muscle cells.  xxxd2446xxx  increased
 xxxg1437xxx , -9, -17, and timp-3 and down-regulated
 xxxg1418xxx , -2, -12, -14, -15, and -16 and timp-4.46
 xxxd2446xxx  acid induced a concentration-dependent increase in  xxxg1418xxx , -3, and -9 gene transcription81 and a concentration- and time-dependent
increase in timp-1 but not timp-2 mrna and
protein.4
loss of cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 expression in the
ciliary body of humans has been associated with
glaucoma.40 this association has led to studies
investigating the connection between pgs, cox-2
expression and mmps. indeed, the iop-lowering
action of  xxxd2446xxx  appears to be associated with
induction of cox-2 and subsequent  xxxg1418xxx  expression in human nonpigmented epithelial cells.27
 xxxg1418xxx  released into the aqueous humor would be
expected to flow into the ciliary muscle and through
the trabecular meshwork and schlemm’s canal to
potentially increase outflow via multiple routes.
studies to elucidate additional cellular mechanisms associated with pg-induced mmp secretion are
ongoing.  xxxd1902xxx - and  xxxd2446xxx -induced secretion
and activation of  xxxg1428xxx  in ciliary muscle cells were
shown to occur via protein kinase c and extracellular
signal regulated protein kinase 1/2-dependent
pathways.28 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity
was stimulated in human ciliary muscle cells with
 xxxd3414xxx  acid o  xxxd1902xxx  o  xxxd2446xxx  acid o
 xxxd340xxx  o  xxxd2446xxx  5  xxxd340xxx  acid. the

s116

toris et al

fp antagonist al-8810 completely inhibited the
mitogen-activated protein kinase activity induced by
 xxxd340xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  acid, indicating that
both agonists were activating the  xxxg1878xxx .57
inhibition of the  xxxd2446xxx -induced reduction
of iop in rats by thalidomide suggested that the
iop-lowering response is mediated, in part, through
 xxxg2296xxx -a-dependent signaling pathways. treatment of human ciliary muscle cells with
 xxxg2296xxx -a increased the secretion of
 xxxg1418xxx , and -2 (husain et al, unpublished data,
abstract 219 presented at the 2006 arvo annual
meeting).
 xxxd1902xxx  can stimulate the formation of endogenous
pgs by stimulation of  xxxg1759xxx  and release
of  xxxd208xxx  for pg synthesis.89 human
ciliary muscle cells exposed to  xxxd1902xxx  ethanolamide
or  xxxd2446xxx  for 9 days show a downregulation of
the  xxxg1878xxx . in the same study, downregulation
of the  xxxg180xxx  and  xxxg2407xxx  genes are proposed
to increase flow through the ciliary muscle and
decrease iop.90
pg-induced changes in the sclera also are
important in the regulation of uveoscleral outflow
and may be used to enhance transscleral delivery of
peptides and other high-molecular-weight substances to the posterior segment of the eye. five
days of topical treatment with  xxxd1902xxx -isopropyl ester
increased  xxxg1418xxx , -2, and -3 in the sclera of
monkeys.79 immunocytochemistry studies and
mrna analysis of human sclera and cultured
human scleral fibroblasts showed the presence of
ep1,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1878xxx  subtypes but not ep3 and
 xxxg1875xxx  subtypes.3 human scleral permeability to
dextrans was measured in an ussing chamber
following exposure to  xxxd1902xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  acid
for 1--3 days. scleral permeability increased in a doseand time-dependent manner. this was accompanied
by an increase in mmp concentration in the media
with the greatest increases in  xxxg1428xxx  and -3
compared to  xxxg1418xxx .33  xxxd1902xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  acid
also induced increases in mrna for mmps and
timps in human scleral organ cultures.82 x-ray
diffraction analysis of human scleral explants
showed that incubation in  xxxd1902xxx -containing media
caused the collagen helix to undergo gelatinization
similar to what was found after incubation with
mmp-enriched media (molik et al, unpublished
data, abstract 406 presented at the 2006 arvo
annual meeting).

subtypes in mediating the iop-lowering response to
clinical pg analogs. studies in  xxxg1878xxx --deficient
mice have shown that the  xxxg1878xxx  is essential for
the early iop-lowering response to topical  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone.48
the involvement of the  xxxg1878xxx  in the iop
reduction with long-term dosing is unknown.
upregulation of  xxxg1428xxx , -3, -9 and fp mrna in
the sclera following 7 days of topical treatment with
 xxxd2446xxx  also was dependent on an intact fp
receptor gene (crowston et al, unpublished data,
abstract 1551 presented at the 2007 arvo annual
meeting). ep receptor-deficient mice have been
studied in similar ways. when ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , and ep3
receptor--deficient mice and their wild-type background strain were treated topically with  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , or unoprostone, it
was found that ep3 receptors were involved in the
iop-lowering response to  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,
and  xxxd340xxx  at 3 hours after drug administration but ep1 and  xxxg1873xxx  receptors were not.50

genetic studies

mice deficient in various pg receptors have been
used to determine the role of prostanoid receptor

pharmacologic differences among the
prostaglandins

natural prostaglandins ( xxxd1902xxx , pge2,  xxxg1073xxx ,
pgi2) have the highest affinity for their respective
receptors (fp, ep, dp, ip) but are relatively nonselective for these and other pg receptors (tp) and
their subtypes ( xxxd1364xxx , dp2, ep1--4) in receptor-binding
studies.57 prostamides are also naturally occurring
neutral lipids which have very little activity at
prostaglandin receptors but, thus far, only pharmacologic evidences exists for a  xxxd340xxx  receptor.87
the therapeutic derivatives of  xxxd1902xxx , either amide
or ester prodrugs, are powerful ocular hypotensive
drugs and either mediate their effects primarily via
 xxxg1878xxx  activation or potentially via some yet
unidentified receptor activation.57
it has been reported that the  xxxd340xxx   xxxd340xxx  stimulates neither fp nor  xxxg1873xxx  receptors and its
effects on aqueous humor outflow, although similar
to  xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd3414xxx , are accomplished via
a receptor distinct from these pure  xxxg1878xxx 
agonists. however,  xxxd340xxx  acid (17-phenyl
 xxxd1902xxx ), which is found in the aqueous humor of
humans after topical application of  xxxd340xxx 
(dahlin et al, arvo 2004 abstract 2096),14,15
exhibits a relatively high affinity for three different
pg receptors (i.e., fp [ki 5 83 nm], ep1 [ki 5 95
nm], ep3 [ki 5 387 nm]).  xxxd340xxx  acid also
exhibits functional activity (phosphoinositide turnover) at the ep1 (ec50 5 2.7 nm) and fp (ec50 5
2.8--3.8 nm) receptors in most cell types.57  xxxd340xxx  acid is a potent, non-selective  xxxd1902xxx  analog.

topical prostaglandins and aqueous humor dynamics

unlike  xxxd1902xxx  or the  xxxg1873xxx  agonist butaprost,
 xxxd340xxx  did not upregulate orphan nuclear
receptor ( xxxg1603xxx ) or  xxxg542xxx 
(ctnf) expression in human ciliary muscle cells or
trabecular meshwork. in addition, the fp antagonist
al-8810 blocked the  xxxd1902xxx -induced  xxxg1603xxx  mrna
expression in human ciliary muscle cells and
trabecular meshwork indicating  xxxd1902xxx -induced
 xxxg1603xxx  mrna expression is via the activation of fp
receptors.36,37  xxxd340xxx  induced the upregulation of  xxxg598xxx  (cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61)
gene expression in cat iris and human ciliary muscle
cells. cry61 is involved in regulating extracellular
matrix-associated signaling proteins and may be
a unique mechanism by which  xxxd340xxx  exerts its
pharmacological action to lower iop independent
of  xxxg1603xxx  or ctnf.37 the importance of the
induction or lack of induction of these various
genes for iop reduction remains to be determined.
the production of transgenic mice lacking these
genes and their iop responses to  xxxd1902xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and butaprost is needed.
 xxxd340xxx  appears to reduce the iop of
patients who are unresponsive to  xxxd2446xxx ,24
suggesting that the  xxxd340xxx   xxxd340xxx  and
the  xxxg1878xxx  agonist  xxxd2446xxx  stimulate
different receptor populations. this is consistent
with studies on isolated iridial cells where  xxxd340xxx  stimulated an entirely different cell population to those sensitive to  xxxd1902xxx  and  xxxd340xxx 
acid (17-phenyl  xxxd1902xxx ).59 an equally plausible
explanation is that some eyes may be deficient in
corneal esterase and thus are not able to adequately
convert the prodrug  xxxd2446xxx  into its free acid
active form.21 also splice variants of the  xxxg1878xxx 
may exist that have not yet been discovered. single
nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter and
intron 1 regions of the  xxxg1878xxx  gene are
correlated with the variability in the iop-lowering
response to  xxxd2446xxx  in normal human eyes.54

including activation of multiple signaling pathways,
and increased expression of some factors and
downregulation of others. genetic studies of knockout mice treated with pgs have found that a reduction in iop requires intact fp and ep3 receptors.
many questions remain unanswered but progress
continues to be made.  xxxd340xxx  antagonists have
been described76,87 but this has raised new questions.7 a  xxxd340xxx  receptor needs to be cloned
and its biosynthesis enzyme identified to conclude
that a unique  xxxd340xxx -sensitive receptor exists.
further work is required to confirm that  xxxd340xxx  acts through this receptor. multiple-dosing
studies of each pg should be compared before
concluding that one pg analog acts through
mechanisms different from all others. live animal
and clinical studies are needed to support claims
made by in vitro experiments. receptor subtype
selectivity of topical pgs should be identified. the
importance of induction or lack of induction of
various genes for iop reduction needs to be
clarified. one day, the current research may lead
to future new drugs that exceed the utility of the
 xxxd1902xxx  analogs.

summary

references

clinical and animal studies of aqueous humor
dynamics have reported that pg analogs effectively
reduce iop by enhancing aqueous humor outflow.
the relative effects of pg analogs on each of the two
outflow pathways may vary, but it appears that they
reduce iop predominantly by increasing uveoscleral
outflow and to a lesser extent trabecular outflow
facility. morphological studies have identified pg
receptors and described significant cellular changes
in pg-treated tissues of both outflow pathways.
biochemical studies have reported many complex
cellular events in pg-treated outflow tissues,
