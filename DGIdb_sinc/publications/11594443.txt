but not antagonist binding to 5-ht2c receptors after chronic treatment

abstract rationale:  xxxd3195xxx  is a novel antipsychotic
drug with high affinity for dopamine d2, alpha-1-adrenoceptors and serotonin 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors. the
 xxxg1115xxx  component of  xxxd3195xxx  may be clinically relevant as this receptor subtype is implicated in
regulation of anxiety, cognition/memory and brain plasticity. objective: to characterise the interaction of  xxxd3195xxx  with the  xxxg1115xxx  using rat choroid plexus
as a physiological receptor source. results:  xxxd3195xxx 
had nanomolar affinity for the  xxxg1115xxx  in vitro.
 xxxd3195xxx  antagonised 5-ht-stimulated phosphoinositide (pi) hydrolysis and, like clozapine, also inhibited
basal pi hydrolysis suggesting that  xxxd3195xxx  is a 5-ht2c
receptor  xxxd1422xxx . the effect of repeated  xxxd3195xxx  dosing on 5-ht2c receptors was studied in rats
treated for 21 days with  xxxd3195xxx  (20, 300 and
1250 µg/kg/day). clozapine (25 mg/kg/day) was used as
a comparison drug.  xxxg1115xxx  binding in the choroid plexus was measured with antagonist and agonist ligands ([3h]mesulergine and [125i]doi) using quantitative autoradiography 8 days after withdrawal. clozapine
decreased  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist and agonist binding sites equally by 36% and 32%, respectively.  xxxd3195xxx  did not induce significant changes in the total number of 5-ht2c receptors, but the highest dose of  xxxd3195xxx  lowered the affinity of [3h]mesulergine for 5-ht2c
receptors. this was most likely due to residual  xxxd3195xxx 
levels in the brain which was supported by direct concentration measurements. in contrast,  xxxd3195xxx  induced
a highly significant and dose-related decrease in 5-ht2c

agonist binding (up to 77%). neither drug affected striatal  xxxg656xxx  binding. conclusions:  xxxd3195xxx , like
clozapine, was found to be a serotonin  xxxg1115xxx 
 xxxd1422xxx . the preferential downregulation of
 xxxg1115xxx  agonist (g-protein-coupled) sites by
chronic administration seemed to differentiate  xxxd3195xxx 
from clozapine at these dose regimens. the  xxxg1115xxx  downregulation during repeated dosing may contribute to therapeutic efficacy and/or side effects of  xxxd3195xxx  treatment.

introduction
 xxxd3195xxx  is a new antipsychotic drug with a proven
clinical efficacy in schizophrenia and with a very low
propensity to induce extrapyramidal side effects (dunn
and fitton 1996; zimbroff et al. 1997).  xxxd3195xxx  has
high affinity for dopamine d2, serotonin 5-ht2a and
5-ht2c receptors as well as alpha-adrenoreceptors in vitro (sanchez et al. 1991; arnt and skarsfeldt 1998). dopamine d2-like receptor blockade still remains the only
well-documented mechanism that is associated with antipsychotic drug action. however, many antipsychotic
drugs have high affinity for the 5-ht2-like receptors
(canton et al. 1990; roth et al. 1992; kuoppamäki et al.
1993b) that have been strongly implicated in their clinical effects, e.g. extrapyramidal side-effect liability
(lieberman et al. 1998; meltzer 1999).
 xxxd3195xxx  has previously been shown to be a potent
5-ht2c antagonist with  xxxd1422xxx  properties in recombinant cell lines (arnt and skarsfeldt 1998; herrickdavis et al. 2000). the  xxxg1115xxx  is a widely distributed 5-ht receptor subtype in the brain including, for
example, limbic cortex and basal ganglia with special
enrichment in the choroid plexus (pazos et al. 1985;
hoffman and mezey 1989). the 5-ht2c antagonist effect may be clinically beneficial, e.g. by inducing anxio-

181

lysis (owen et al. 1993; kennett et al 2000). however,
5-ht2c receptors may be involved in the potential of a
drug to cause weight gain (tecott et al. 1995), a side effect seen with most atypical drugs, including  xxxd3195xxx 
(allison et al. 1999).
we characterised further the interaction of  xxxd3195xxx 
with the  xxxg1115xxx  using a physiological receptor
model, the choroid plexus. the atypical antipsychotic
drug clozapine, a known 5-ht2c  xxxd1422xxx  in vivo
and in vitro (barker et al. 1994; kuoppamäki et al.
1994), was used as a reference drug in the assays. the
main motivation for this study was to explore the effects
of  xxxd3195xxx  on 5-ht2c regulation during chronic treatment. the gradual onset of therapeutic effects and some
side effects of antipsychotic drugs suggests that longterm adaptive neurochemical changes may be even more
important than the immediate effects of these drugs. we
have previously compared the long-term effects of clozapine with some new and conventional antipsychotic
drugs (risperidone,  xxxd162xxx , org 5222, haloperidol,
chlorpromazine) on the regulation of 5-ht2c receptors.
so far, using behaviourally relevant doses, clozapine has
been the only compound decreasing significantly (by
about 50%) 5-ht2c antagonist and agonist binding in
the rat brain after chronic dosing (hietala et al. 1992;
kuoppamäki et al. 1995). we have now extended these
studies to include  xxxd3195xxx . quantitative receptor autoradiography was used for this purpose and clozapine was
included in the study as a positive control. for comparison, striatal  xxxg656xxx  density was also determined after the treatments.

materials and methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats (weighing 205–240 g at the beginning
of the study) were used. the mean weights of rats did not differ
between groups. rats were housed in groups of three under standard laboratory conditions (temperature 21°c, humidity 55±5%,
lights on from 0600 hours to 1800 hours). free access to standard
pelleted food and tap water was available at all times. the study
protocol was approved by the animal use and care committee,
university of turku.
drugs, doses and treatments
clozapine ( xxxd1733xxx  25 mg/ml; novartis/sandoz pharma ag,
basle, switzerland) was used as commercially available ampoules.
 xxxd3195xxx  was generously provided by h. lundbeck a/s (valby,
denmark). five groups of rats (n=6 per treatment group) received
subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of clozapine (25 mg/kg),  xxxd3195xxx 
(20, 300 or 1250 µg/kg), or an equal volume (1 ml/kg) of saline
once a day for 21 days. the dose of clozapine was chosen according to previous studies showing effective regulation of 5-ht2a and
 xxxg1115xxx  binding (kuoppamäki et al. 1995). three doses of
 xxxd3195xxx  were used to study possible dose dependence and selected according to ed50 values of various in vivo models. for example, the ed50 values of  xxxd3195xxx  for inhibition of the a10 and
a9 neurons after a 21-day treatment have been reported to be
6.6 µg/kg/day and 705 µg/kg/day, respectively (skarsfeldt and
perregaard 1990). in addition, the ed50 values of  xxxd3195xxx  (24 h

after a single dose) for the induction of catalepsy and inhibition of
 xxxg1113xxx -mediated head twitches are 35,000 µg/kg and
13 µg/kg, respectively (sanchez et al. 1991).
brain dissection
rats were decapitated 8 days after the last injection due to long
elimination half-life of  xxxd3195xxx . for 5-ht2c and  xxxg656xxx  autoradiography, the brains were quickly removed after decapitation,
frozen on tissue pedestals using dry ice and tissue-glue (tissuetek o.c.t. compound, miles inc., elkhart, ind.) and stored at
–70°c. coronal sections (12 µm) of choroid plexus (co-ordinates
a6860–a6670 according to könig and klippel's atlas) and striatum (a9650–a8920) were cut from the same brains with a cryostat microtome at –18°c. sections were thaw-mounted onto gelatine-coated slides, air-dried at room temperature, and stored at
–70°c with desiccator until used. for the  xxxg1115xxx  homogenate binding assay, choroid plexi were quickly removed after decapitation, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –70°c. fresh choroid
plexi were used for  xxxg1115xxx -induced phosphoinositide
(pi) hydrolysis assay. for this purpose, choroid plexi were rapidly
dissected out after decapitation and a single choroid plexus was
placed into 5 ml krebs-bicarbonate (krb) buffer.
the  xxxg1115xxx -mediated pi hydrolysis assay
the antagonism of  xxxg1115xxx -stimulated pi hydrolysis and
possible agonist activity of  xxxd3195xxx  and clozapine in this assay
was examined as previously described (pälvimäki et al. 1996,
1998). briefly, krb buffer was used as incubation medium. the
samples were labelled with 1 µci [3h]myo-inositol (new england
nuclear, mass.) for 90 min in the presence of o2/co2 (95:5).
then, 10 µm  xxxd2850xxx  and 10 mm lithium were added and the incubation was continued for 15 min. a column of dowex-1 anionexchange resin in the formate form was used to separate different
inositol phosphates. inositol monophosphate (ip) was eluted with
10 ml 200 mm ammonium formate/0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx . optiphase
'hisafe' 3 (lkb wallac, loughborough, england) was used as
scintillation fluid. the ic50 values (with 95% confidence limits)
against 5-ht-stimulated pi hydrolysis were calculated using
graphpad prism 2.01 software. conversion of ic50 values to ki
values was done as described using a 5-ht ec50 value of 21 nm
in the pi hydrolysis assay (pälvimäki et al. 1996).
 xxxg1115xxx  autoradiography with [3h]mesulergine
the  xxxg1115xxx  autoradiography with [3h]mesulergine was
performed as previously described (kuoppamäki et al. 1994) with
minor modifications to measure changes in maximal binding density (bmax) and kd values of antagonist  xxxg1115xxx  binding.
for this purpose, a scatchard analysis was performed with five
different [3h]mesulergine concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 nm).
briefly, the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in
a large volume of 170 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.5) containing a
given concentration of [3h]mesulergine (78 ci/mmol, amersham).
nonspecific binding was determined by incubating the adjacent
sections in the presence of 5 µm  xxxd2621xxx . spiperone
(100 nm) was used to prevent any binding to 5-ht2a receptors.
the slides were apposed to kodak xar-5 x-ray films together
with plastic [3h]standards (american radiolabelled chemicals,
st. louis, mo.) for 32 days at 4°c. to avoid overestimation of the
number of 5-ht2c receptors (labelled by [3h]mesulergine) and to
compare absolute numbers of [125i]doi and [3h]mesulergine
binding sites in the choroid plexus, [3h]choroid plexus paste standards were prepared to convert the values of [3h]plastic standards
(µci/g plastic) to picomoles of ligand bound per gram of tissue
(kuoppamäki et al. 1995).

182
 xxxg1115xxx  autoradiography with [125i]doi
[125i]doi

was done as
the  xxxg1115xxx  autoradiography with
previously described (kuoppamäki et al. 1994). briefly, the sections were drop-incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 µl
50 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.5) containing 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.1%
(w/v) bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 5 nm [125i]doi (new england
nuclear). the limited amount of choroid plexus sections did not
allow a full scatchard analysis and separate determination of kd
(affinity) and bmax (density) of [125i]doi binding sites. this was
the reason for using a high, saturating concentration (5 nm) of
[125i]doi which reflects preferentially changes in the density of
binding sites. the original activity of [125i]doi (2200 ci/mmol)
was diluted tenfold with non-radioactive (±)doi (research biochemicals international, mass). nonspecific binding was determined by incubating the adjacent sections in the presence of 5 µm
 xxxd2621xxx . spiperone (100 nm) was used to prevent binding to
5-ht2a receptors. the slides were apposed to kodak xar-5
x-ray films together with plastic [14c]standards (american radiolabelled chemicals) for 1–2 days at 4°c.
 xxxg656xxx  autoradiography with [3h]spiperone
 xxxg656xxx  autoradiography with [3h]spiperone was performed as
previously described (kuoppamäki et al. 1995). briefly, after preincubation, the sections were drop-incubated for 60 min at room
temperature in 100 µl tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.4) containing a saturating concentration (1.5 nm) of [3h]spiperone (119 ci/mmol,
amersham), 100 nm  xxxd2419xxx  (to block 5-ht2a receptors), and
120 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 2 mm cacl2 and 1 mm mgcl2. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 µm (–)sulpiride. the slides were finally apposed to kodak xar-5 x-ray
films together with plastic [3h]standards (american radiolabelled
chemicals) for 32 days at 4°c. films were developed with an automated fuji rg ii x-ray film processor. for a comparison between treatment groups, all sections from all groups were exposed
to the same sheet of film.
image analysis
the images were analysed using a ccd video camera
(hamamatsu c3077, hamamatsu photonics k.k., hamamatsu
city, japan) and a computerised image analysis system (mcid,
m4 1.12, imaging research inc., st. catharines, ontario, canada)
as previously described (kuoppamäki et al. 1995). due to the differential [3h]autoabsorption (quenching) of various brain areas,
the values obtained with [3h]plastic standards (µci/g plastic) were
converted to picomoles of ligand bound per gram of tissue using
conversion factors for the grey matter (american radiolabelled
chemicals) in the case of d2 receptors and the [3h]choroid plexus
paste standards in the case of 5-ht2c receptors.

results
effects of  xxxd3195xxx  on  xxxg1115xxx -mediated pi
hydrolysis in the choroid plexus
 xxxd3195xxx  antagonised 5-ht-induced pi hydrolysis in a
concentration-dependent manner with an ic50 value of
165 nm (fig. 1). in addition,  xxxd3195xxx  decreased basal
pi hydrolysis by about 20% with an estimated ec50
value of 217 nm (fig. 2a). in identical assay conditions,
clozapine decreased basal pi hydrolysis by about 25%
with an ec50 value of 140 nm (fig. 2b).

on  xxxg1115xxx  binding sites labelled with an
antagonist radioligand, [3h]mesulergine, and an agonist
radioligand, [125i]doi, in the rat choroid plexus
the results are summarised in fig. 3. clozapine decreased  xxxg1115xxx  density by 36% (p=0.036),
whereas  xxxd3195xxx  did not induce a significant effect in
the bmax (–14% to +3%). the highest dose regimen of
 xxxd3195xxx  induced a marked increase in the apparent kd
value of 5-ht2c receptors. in contrast to antagonist binding sites, agonist binding sites labelled by [125i]doi
were reduced in a dose-related manner by  xxxd3195xxx 
(from –13% down to –77%). clozapine also reduced
5-ht2c agonist binding sites by 32%.
effects of chronic  xxxd3195xxx  and clozapine treatments

concentrations in rat brain
 xxxd3195xxx  and its metabolite concentrations were measured 24 h
after the last injection as well as after a withdrawal period of
8 days. the analyses were performed using high-performance
liquid chromatography and fluorometric detection (tzeng et al.
1994).
statistical analysis
statistical analysis of the data was carried out using one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by tukey's test for post-hoc
analyses. statistical software (systat, evanston, ill.) was used for
this purpose. a p value lower than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

in the rat choroid plexus by  xxxd3195xxx . increasing concentrations
of  xxxd3195xxx  were added to incubation tubes 15 min before the addition of 100 nm 5-ht. the ic50 value (with 95% ci) was
165 nm (82–340 nm) for  xxxd3195xxx , whereas that for clozapine
was 110 nm (46–260 nm; kuoppamäki et al. 1993b). these ic50

discussion
 xxxd3195xxx  is a potent  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist
with  xxxd1422xxx  properties
the ki value of  xxxd3195xxx  for the rat/human  xxxg1115xxx  is 0.5–0.7 nm (against [3h]-mesulergine), the affinity being about ten times higher than that of clozapine
(5–10 nm; arnt and skarsfeldt 1998; herrick-davis
et al. 2000). in line with our results, arnt and skarsfeldt
(1998) have reported that  xxxd3195xxx  is a potent 5-ht2c
receptor antagonist, inhibiting 5-ht-stimulated ip1 formation in nih-3t3 cells transfected with the rat 5-ht2c
receptor. in this study, we observed that  xxxd3195xxx  decreased basal  xxxg1115xxx -mediated pi hydrolysis in
the choroid plexus in vitro indicating that  xxxd3195xxx  is a
 xxxg1115xxx   xxxd1422xxx . this is well in agreement with the results of herrick-davis et al. (2000) who
reported similar findings in cos-7 cells expressing the
human  xxxg1115xxx . the maximal inhibition of basal
pi hydrolysis in choroid plexus was about 20–30%,
which parallels to that induced by various  xxxg1115xxx  inverse agonists in sf9 cells (labrecque et al. 1995).

184

however, for unknown reasons, much higher reductions
of basal  xxxg1115xxx -mediated pi hydrolysis have
been reported using other recombinant cell lines expressing the  xxxg1115xxx  (westphal and sanders-bush
1994; herrick-davis et al. 2000). the concentrations required for 5-ht2c inverse agonism were similar to those
inhibiting 5-ht-induced stimulation of pi hydrolysis
(ki 29 nm). however, these concentrations are clearly
higher than those required for inhibition of [3h]mesulergine binding, which may relate to dominance of spare
receptors (gtp insensitive) in the choroid plexus
(pälvimäki et al. 1996).
the  xxxg1115xxx   xxxd1422xxx  property is not
unique to  xxxd3195xxx  and is shared by many other atypical
and classical antipsychotic drugs in the choroid plexus
(kuoppamäki et al. 1995; but see herrick-davis et al.
2000). the inverse agonism phenomenon is well characterised in vitro, but there is evidence that the  xxxd1422xxx  activity of clozapine is apparent also after acute
and chronic treatments ex vivo (kuoppamäki et al. 1994,
1995). the inverse agonism may, in fact, be common for
most g-protein-coupled receptors and important in the
therapeutic actions of antagonist drugs (milligan et al.
1995).

(bottom) after 21 days treatment with clozapine (cloz;
25 mg/kg/day) and  xxxd3195xxx  (sert; 20, 300 or 1250 µg/kg/day). 5ht2c receptor bmax and kd in the rat choroid plexus were determined 8 days after withdrawal using quantitative autoradiography
and the antagonist ligand [3h]mesulergine, whereas agonist binding
sites were measured using a saturating concentration of [125i]doi.
overall analyses of variance for the density, affinity and agonist
binding were f4,25=3.134, p=0.032; f4,25=16.591, p<0.001; and
f4,25=64.55, p<0.001, respectively. bars represent mean±sem, n=6.
*p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001 compared with control group

it is believed that agonist high and low affinity states refer to g-protein coupled and uncoupled forms of the receptor, respectively. thus, an antagonist radioligand
[3h]mesulergine is thought to label the total population
(i.e. agonist high and low affinity states) of 5-ht2c receptors, whereas an agonist radioligand (e.g. [125i]doi)
is believed to selectively label the  xxxg1115xxx  high
affinity state (only 5–10% of the total receptor density;
appel et al. 1990; havlik and peroutka 1992; leonhardt
et al. 1992). this assumption is probably an oversimplification but still useful as a theoretical framework. in
this study, repeated administration of clozapine induced
a marked and equal decrease in both antagonist and
agonist labelled sites. it seems that the observed downregulatory effect of clozapine is long lasting and only
slightly less than that observed 3 days after withdrawal
(kuoppamäki et al. 1993a). in contrast to clozapine,
chronic  xxxd3195xxx  treatment failed to decrease the total
 xxxg1115xxx  density in doses that should induce a
marked (>90%) occupancy of 5-ht2c receptors (schotte
et al. 1996). however, the highest  xxxd3195xxx  dose significantly increased the apparent kd value of [3h]mesulergine binding even 8 days after withdrawal. this is
most likely explained by residual  xxxd3195xxx /metabolite
concentrations in the brain as direct measurements
showed relatively consistent residual  xxxd3195xxx  concentrations in the brain after the 1250-µg/kg dose. in addition, norsertindole was also present in a relatively high
amount at this time point, although this metabolite has
about 10–20 times less affinity for the rat  xxxg1115xxx  than  xxxd3195xxx  in vitro (lundbeck, data on file).

185

however, dehydrosertindole has a similar receptor profile as  xxxd3195xxx , but this metabolite was present only in
a few samples.
chronic  xxxd3195xxx  treatment decreased dose dependently  xxxg1115xxx  binding density as determined
with a saturating concentration (5 nm) of an agonist radioligand [125i]doi. the effect was marked (up to 77%)
and highly significant with  xxxd3195xxx  doses of 300 µg/kg
and 1250 µg/kg. in analogy with the [3h]mesulergine
binding data, residual  xxxd3195xxx /metabolites concentration is likely to explain a part of the decrease observed
after the highest  xxxd3195xxx  dose, and a combined change
in density and affinity cannot be excluded. however, the
use of saturating concentration of [125i]doi makes the
assay less sensitive for kd changes.
the difference between  xxxg1115xxx  [125i]doi
and [3h]mesulergine binding could be explained if  xxxd3195xxx  and/or its metabolites has higher affinity for the
 xxxg1115xxx  g-protein coupled than for the g-protein uncoupled form and, thus, may also occupy 5-ht2c
receptor high affinity states to a greater extent. however,
this is unlikely as  xxxg1115xxx  inverse agonists bind
with a higher affinity to the low affinity state than the
high affinity state of the  xxxg1115xxx  (westphal and
sanders-bush 1994). a more likely explanation is that
 xxxd3195xxx  (as an  xxxd1422xxx ) shifts the receptor
equilibrium towards low affinity states, which could explain the decrease in the number of high affinity states
(milligan et al. 1995). other explanations, such as altered post-translational processing of the  xxxg1115xxx  during the treatment, are also possible as rna editing may be involved in the regulation of agonist affinity
for the receptor (herrick-davis et al. 1999; wang et al.
2000).
barker et al. (1994) have suggested that treatment
with inverse agonists leads to  xxxg1115xxx  downregulation (in nih-3t3 cells), while neutral antagonists
have no effect. however, labrecque et al. (1995) postulated that the  xxxd1422xxx  activity and the ability to
downregulate 5-ht2c receptors (in sf9 cells) are distinct
features of  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists. thus, the constituents of different cell lines used for  xxxg1115xxx 
expression studies may account for differences in the
ability of an  xxxd1422xxx  to downregulate 5-ht2c receptors in vitro. this is also indirectly supported by findings showing that, for example, n-glycosylation of the
 xxxg1115xxx  protein may change during transfection
into cultured cells, which in turn may lead to altered function differing from that observed in vivo (abramowski
and staufenbiel 1995). nevertheless, it appears that
 xxxg1115xxx  inverse agonism and the ability to
downregulate 5-ht2c receptors even in vivo in the rat
choroid plexus are not directly connected. this is supported by our findings on other drugs such as org5222,
a putative antipsychotic drug and  xxxd1842xxx , a putative anxiolytic drug, which are inverse agonists at the
 xxxg1115xxx  but do not downregulate 5-ht2c receptors after chronic treatment in doses that induce a high
occupancy of these receptors (kuoppamäki et al. 1995;
pälvimäki et al. 1998).

 xxxg1115xxx  downregulation by  xxxd3195xxx  –
functional implications
the observed decrease in agonist binding by  xxxd3195xxx  is
likely to be relevant functionally as we have previously
observed that changes in 5-ht2c agonist binding parallel
relatively closely changes in choroid plexus pi hydrolysis after chronic treatment with clozapine (kuoppamäki
et al. 1994). recent developments in the discovery of selective and specific  xxxg1115xxx  ligands should facilitate studies also on other brain areas such as the limbic
cortex, probably more relevant for clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs.
 xxxd3195xxx  has demonstrated anxiolytic activity in
preclinical studies and a reduced  xxxg1115xxx  tone
may play a role in anxiolysis as 5-ht2c agonists appear
to be anxiogenic (owen et al. 1993; kennett et al. 2000).
the  xxxg1115xxx  has also been suggested to be involved in cognitive processing/memory and brain plasticity (tecott et al. 1998) partly via modulation of dopamine levels in the frontal cortex (millan et al. 1998;
di giovanni et al. 2000).  xxxd3195xxx  does not worsen the
performance of rats in tests measuring cognitive activity
(spatial learning, working and reference memory; arnt
and skarsfeldt 1998) but clinical data on cognition and
newer antipsychotic drugs, also  xxxd3195xxx , are not conclusive at this stage (meltzer and mcgurk 1999). weight
gain with  xxxd3195xxx  and antipsychotic drugs in general
may involve long-term  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism
(tecott et al. 1995; allison et al. 1999; meltzer 1999) but
also other mechanisms, such as the  xxxg1078xxx  blockade, are likely to play a role.
 xxxd3195xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  regulation
chronic treatment with typical antipsychotic drugs, such
as haloperidol and chlorpromazine, induce significant
striatal  xxxg656xxx  upregulation (burt et al. 1977;
deutch et al. 1991) which may link to extrapyramidal
side-effect liability. clozapine and  xxxd3195xxx  treatments
did not affect striatal  xxxg656xxx  binding determined
with [3h]spiperone. lack of striatal  xxxg656xxx  upregulation after chronic  xxxd3195xxx  treatment is surprising
considering its high  xxxg656xxx  affinity in vitro but it is
in line with its very weak potency to inhibit various d2
receptor mediated behaviours in vivo (sanchez et al.
1991). it seems that high  xxxg656xxx  occupancy is
compensated by other mechanisms resulting in low extrapyramidal side effects (arnt and skarsfeldt 1998). an
appropriate ratio of d2/ xxxg1113xxx  antagonism during chronic treatment has been suggested to be crucial in
this respect (meltzer 1999; but see nyberg and farde
2000).

conclusions
 xxxd3195xxx  and clozapine are inverse agonists at the
 xxxg1115xxx  and preferentially stabilise inactive con-

186

formation of g-protein-coupled 5-ht2c receptors. despite similar interaction of clozapine and  xxxd3195xxx  with
the  xxxg1115xxx , differences existed in the pattern of
5-ht2c regulation after chronic dosing. unlike clozapine, chronic  xxxd3195xxx  treatment downregulated only
5-ht2c agonist (g-protein coupled) binding without affecting the total number of 5-ht2c receptors in the choroid plexus. exploration of differences in neural adaptation during chronic treatment will further elucidate the
mechanisms behind the distinct clinical properties of old
and new antipsychotic drugs.
