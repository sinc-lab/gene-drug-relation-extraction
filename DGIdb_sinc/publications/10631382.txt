effects of  xxxd2469xxx  on lipid mediator release from guinea pig lung fragments.  the effects of  xxxd2469xxx , a novel histamine h1-receptor antagonist, on lipid mediator release induced by antigen-antibody reaction from actively sensitized guinea pig lung fragments were studied.  xxxd2469xxx  dose-dependently inhibited the release of leukotriene c4 from guinea pig lung fragments induced by antigen. a significant effect was observed with  xxxd2469xxx  at a concentration of 10(-4) m. on the other hand,  xxxd2469xxx  produced no effect on the release of leukotriene e4 or thromoboxane b2. from these findings, it was concluded that  xxxd2469xxx  may be useful for relieving the nasal obstruction in allergic rhinitis caused by inhibition of leukotriene c4 release.
