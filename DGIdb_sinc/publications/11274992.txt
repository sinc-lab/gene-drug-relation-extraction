abstract
plasticity in transmission and modulatory systems are implicated in mechanisms of neuropathic pain. studies demonstrate the
importance of high voltage-activated ca2q channels in pain transmission, but the role of low voltage-activated, t-type ca2q channels in
nociception has not been investigated. the kim and chung rodent model of neuropathy wpain 50 ž1992. 355x was used to induce
mechanical and cold allodynia in the ipsilateral hindpaw. in vivo electrophysiological techniques were used to record the response of
dorsal horn neurones to innocuous and noxious electrical and natural žmechanical and thermal. stimuli after spinal nerve ligation. spinal
 xxxd2056xxx  ž5–1055 mg. exerted dose-related inhibitions of both the electrically and low- and high-intensity mechanical and thermal
evoked neuronal responses and its profile remained unaltered after neuropathy. measures of spinal cord hyperexcitability were most
susceptible to  xxxd2056xxx . this study, for the first time, indicates a possible role for low voltage-activated ca2q channels in sensory
transmission. q 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
neuropathic pain, arising from injury- or disease-evoked
damage to the peripheral or central nervous system, often
responds poorly to traditional analgesics. patients often
experience sensory deficits, persistent and stimulus-evoked
pain žallodynia and hyperalgesia.. peripheral nerve damage
provides abnormal input into the central nervous system
and then leads to dorsal horn hyperexcitability. under the
influence of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems, the dorsal horn is a site of peripheral input
modulation before projection to higher brain centres, thus
it controls the stimulus–response relationship. reduction
of this excitability is a possible key to neuropathic pain
management.
animal models of neuropathy have been critical in
elucidating its complex causal mechanisms, involving plas-

the rat spinal nerve ligation model žkim and chung,
1992. involves tight ligation of two žl5 and l6. of the
three spinal nerves that form the sciatic nerve. behavioural
consequences include thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical and cooling allodynia žkim and chung, 1992; chaplan

high voltage-activated ca2q channels žl-, n-, prqand r-types., consisting of a pore-forming a1 subunit and
modulatory accessory subunits, b, a 2-d and g žwalker
and de waard, 1998., are widely expressed throughout the
brain and spinal cord žkerr et al., 1988; mintz et al., 1992;
gohil et al., 1994.. they are activated by relatively strong
membrane depolarisation and permit ca2q influx in response to action potentials. consequential secondary actions include neurotransmitter release; thus these channels
establish a major link between neuronal excitability and
synaptic transmission. for these reasons high voltageactivated ca2q channels have been the focus of both acute
and persistent pain transmission studies. animal models
have demonstrated the antinociceptive abilities of antagonists specific for l-, n- and prq-type ca2q channels,

nociception, often dependent on the nature of the pain state
žvanegas and schaible, 2000..
in addition to high voltage-activated ca2q channels,
kinetically distinct low voltage-activated ca2q channels, or
t-type channels, also exist both in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. they activate at voltages near the resting
membrane potential, inactivate rapidly, deactivate slowly
and have a small single channel conductance žhuguenard,
1996.. these unique gating properties prohibit t-type
channels alone to support neurotransmission, however they
permit their involvement in low-amplitude oscillations,
neuronal bursting, synaptic signal boosting, ca2q entry
promotion and lowering threshold for high-threshold spike
generation. this ca2q current appears to play an important
physiological role in near-threshold phenomena and regulation of neuronal excitability.
until recently, the low voltage-activated current was
considered a single entity. however, a1g, a1h and a1i
subunits have now been cloned, showing 30% homology
to high voltage-activated channel forming a1 subunits
žcribbs et al., 1998; perez-reyes, 1998; lee et al., 1999.
and hallmark native t-type ca2q channel properties when
expressed heterologously. in situ hybridisation studies on
the rat brain have shown that these channels have unique
distributions, including the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
and sensory ganglia žtalley et al., 1999.. this is complimented by reported t-type currents in primary sensory
neurones žcarbone and lux, 1984; kostyuk et al., 1992;
scroggs and fox, 1992; todorovic and lingle, 1998. and
some superficial rat dorsal horn neurones žryu and randic,
1990., an important site for the processing and integration
of sensory information, including pain. unlike the high
voltage-activated ca2q channels, the involvement of t-type
channels in pain-related central sensitisation has been hindered by a scarcity of specific pharmacological agents.
neuropathic pain and epilepsy both share neuronal hyperexcitability as a common underlying mechanism. there
are established antiepileptic drugs that target the generation of neuronal hyperexcitability in the brain and some of
these have been proven effective in the treatment of various forms of neuropathic pain žswerdlow and cundill,
1981; mcquay et al., 1995.. the succinimde derivative
 xxxd2056xxx , or 2-ethyl-2-methylsuccinimide, is an anticonvulsant žmacdonald and mclean, 1986. effective in the
treatment of absence epilepsy žcoulter et al., 1989b.; a
condition characterised by spike-wave rhythm likely generated by t-type ca2q current.  xxxd2056xxx  has been
demonstrated to be a relatively specific t-type channel
antagonist in thalamic žcoulter et al., 1989a. and dorsal
root ganglion neurones žkostyuk et al., 1992.. this study
uses the spinal nerve ligation model, confirmed by behavioural testing, to induce a neuropathic state, subsequent
to which electrophysiological studies of dorsal horn spinal
neurones were made to investigate the effects of spinally
delivered  xxxd2056xxx  on a wide range of electrical and
natural-evoked neuronal activity.

2. materials and methods
2.1. spinal nerõe ligation
male sprague–dawley rats, initially weighing 130–150
g, were used in this study. all experimental procedures
were approved by the home office and follow the guidelines under the international association for the study of
pain žzimmermann, 1983.. selective tight ligation of spinal
nerves l5 and l6, and a sham procedure were performed
as first described by kim and chung ž1992.. for details,
see chapman et al. ž1998..
2.2. behaõioural testing
for 2 weeks following surgery, the rats were housed in
groups of 4, in plastic cages under a 12r12 h dayrnight
cycle and their general health monitored. successful reproduction of the neuropathic model was confirmed by behavioural testing žpost-operative days 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 and
14. assessing the sensitivity of both the ipsilateral and
contralateral hindpaws to normally non-noxious punctate

stimuli. rats were placed in transparent plastic cubicles on
a mesh floor and allowed to acclimatise before initiating
any tests. foot withdrawals to von frey filaments 1, 5 and
9 g žtrials of 10. and acetone žtrials of 5. were quantified
as described in chapman et al. ž1998. and expressed as
difference scoress ipsilateral responsey contralateral response.
2.3. spinal cord electrophysiology
subsequent to behavioural testing žpost-operative days
14–17., the operated rats were used for electrophysiological studies ždickenson and sullivan, 1986.. briefly, anaesthesia was induced with 3% halothane in a mixture of 66%
n2 o and 33% o 2 and a cannula inserted into the trachea.
a laminectomy was performed žvertebrae l1–l3. to expose segments l4–l5 of the spinal cord and the level of
halothane was reduced to 1.8%. extracellular recordings of
single convergent neurones, located deep within the dorsal
horn ž) 500 mm., receiving input from the toe region
ipsilateral to the spinal nerve ligation or sham procedure,
were made using a parylene coated tungsten electrode.
neurones selected responded to both noxious žpinch. and
non-noxious žtouch. stimuli.
2.3.1. cell characterisation
spontaneous activity exhibited by a neurone was
recorded over 10 min. action potentials evoked by natural
stimuli applied constantly over 10 s were quantified by the
application of both punctate mechanical žvon frey fila-

ments 9 and 75 g. and thermal žconstant water jet at 458c.
stimuli applied to the centre of the neurone’s receptive
field. the thermal response to 458c was determined by
subtracting the response to 328c ža non-noxious temperature so as to ascertain any mechanical response evoked by
the water jet. from the response to 458c. all responses to
natural stimuli were normalised by the subtraction of any
spontaneous activity measured before the application of
each stimulus. response of the neurone to transcutaneous
electrical stimulation was established by insertion of two
fine needles into the centre of its peripheral receptive field.
a test consisted of a train of 16 stimuli ž2 ms wide pulse at
0.5 hz at three times the threshold required to evoke a
c-fibre response., and a post-stimulus histogram was constructed. the thresholds were determined by increasing the
electrical stimulus from 0 ma until an action potential was
evoked in the corresponding latency band. electrically
evoked action potentials were separated on a latency basis
into ab-fibres ž0–20 ms., ad-fibres ž20–90 ms., c-fibres
ž90–300 ms. and post-discharge ž300–800 ms.. the ‘input’ is the number of action potentials ž90–800 ms. evoked
by the first stimulus of the train. ‘excess spikes’ is a
measure of ‘wind-up’, which is increased neuronal excitability to repeated constant stimulation. excess spikes
was calculated as the total action potentials ž90–800 ms.
after 16 stimulus train minus the input = 16. wind-up
graphs for individual neurones show how the combined
number of evoked c-fibre and post-discharge action potentials ži.e., 90–800 ms. increases with each repeated electrical stimulation.

2.3.2. pharmacological studies
the testing protocol, initiated every 10 min, consisted
of an electrical test followed by the natural stimuli, as
described above. stabilisation of the neuronal responses
was confirmed with at least three consistent pre-drug
responses ž- 10% variation., for all measures. these values were then averaged to generate pre-drug control values
with which to compare the effect of  xxxd2056xxx  žsigmaaldrich, poole, dorset, uk. administration on subsequent
evoked responses.  xxxd2056xxx  was dissolved in saline
and applied directly onto the spinal cord in 50 ml volumes.
each dose ž5, 55, 555, 1055 mg. was followed until
maximum effects were exerted ža minimum of 50 min.,
when the next dose would be applied cumulatively. the
results were calculated as maximum percentage inhibition
from the averaged pre-drug value for each neurone and the
overall results for each dose were expressed as means"
standard error of mean žs.e.m.. of the normalised data.
statistical analysis of maximal drug effects at each dose
compared to the averaged pre-drug value was determined
by paired t-test on raw data. an unpaired t-test on the
normalised data was used for the comparison of drug
effects between different experimental groups. the level of
significance was taken as p f 0.05.

3.1. behaõioural studies
during the post-operative period the animals showed
normal weight gain and maintained good general health.
rats subjected to spinal nerve ligation exhibited abnormal
foot posture ipsilateral to nerve injury whereby toes were
held together in a ‘guarding’ behaviour. this did not occur
in either the contralateral hindpaw, or in the sham-operated
rats. successful replication of the nerve injury model was
confirmed by behavioural testing which demonstrated the

in some cases by shaking and licking of the foot ipsilateral
to spinal nerve ligation. this was evident at post-operative
day 2, reached maximum at days 7–12 and still maintained
at day 14 žfig. 1.. consistent withdrawal responses were
never exhibited by the control group or by the contralateral
hindpaw of the experimental group, and when present were
never accompanied by the pain-like behaviours displayed
by the lesioned hindpaw of spinal nerve ligated rats.

a receptive field over the left ipsilateral hindpaw. no
significant differences were found between experimental
groups in the mean values of recorded neurone depth,
responses evoked by electrical and natural stimulation, and
level of ongoing spontaneous activity. it is worth noting
that 45% of neurones characterised in spinal nerve ligated
rats exhibited spontaneous activity at a rate greater than
0.1 hz in comparison to only 17% of characterised neurones in sham-operated rats and 25% of naive.
3.2.2. pharmacological studies
the effect of  xxxd2056xxx  ž5–1055 mg., applied directly onto the spinal cord, on the electrically and naturally
evoked dorsal horn neuronal responses was tested in spinal

 xxxd2056xxx  produced a dose-related inhibition of the
electrically and naturally evoked responses in neurones in
all experimental groups žfigs. 2, 3 and 4. and there was no

4. discussion
unilateral tight ligation of l5 and l6 spinal nerves
produced reproducible nociceptive syndromes in the lesioned hindpaw. a clear withdrawal reflex with associated
aversive behaviours, indicative of the development of mechanical and cooling allodynia, was produced as previously described by chapman et al. ž1998.. thus, all spinal
nerve ligated animals used for the electrophysiology and
subsequent pharmacology exhibited neuropathic signs;
sham-operated did not. this is the first electrophysiological study addressing the role of low voltage-activated
t-type ca2q channels in the spinal processing of sensory
information after nerve injury. spinal  xxxd2056xxx , a relatively specific t-type channel antagonist, mediated significant inhibition of the electrical and natural žinnocuous and
noxious. evoked rat dorsal horn neuronal responses, suggesting some role for t-type ca2q channels in sensory
transmission.
extensive behavioural and electrophysiological nociceptive studies have demonstrated an important role for high
voltage-activated ca2q channels in the processing of pain
žvanegas and schaible, 2000.. the contribution of n-,
prq- or l-type channels appears to alter depending on the
nature of the pain žacute or chronic, inflammatory or
neuropathic in origin., and this has been established by the
use of specific channel antagonists. a predominant nociceptive role for n-type channels has been established,
which is enhanced after neuropathy žchaplan et al., 1994;
xiao and bennett, 1995; bowersox et al., 1996; brose et
al., 1997; white and cousins, 1998; matthews and dickenson, 2000.. upon substantial membrane depolarisation nand p-type voltage-activated ca2q channels mediate the
release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate,
 xxxg2240xxx  and calcitonin gene-related peptide, critical for
wind-up and central sensitisation, in the presence of constant afferent input ždickenson, 1994..
this study highlights the role of ca2q influx via t-type
channels in the nociception pathway, within which  xxxd2056xxx  may be exerting its effects at a number of sites.
the biophysical characteristics of the t-type channel have
led to its implication mainly in the regulation of cell
excitability. the broad action of  xxxd2056xxx , with no
marked selectivity for a particular modality or evoked
response, is in keeping with an action on postsynaptically
located ca2q channels. since t-type channel activation
occurs close to resting potential, they allow ca2q influx
when cells are at rest žmagee and johnston, 1995. or in
response to subthreshold synaptic inputs žmarkram and
sakmann, 1994; magee and johnston, 1995.. thus, these
channels enhance neuronal excitability and contribute to

the generation of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations that lead to bursts of sodium dependent action potentials žhuguenard, 1996.. whilst unable to mediate synaptic
transmission alone, t-type channels do serve to boost
synaptic inputs and lower threshold for high-threshold
spike generation. their block would result in an overall
reduction in the underlying level of neuronal excitability,
rendering the achievement of threshold levels of membrane depolarisation less likely. postsynaptically, nmda
receptor activation would be reduced as would the consequential development of central sensitisation.
in this study,  xxxd2056xxx  exerted its greatest inhibitory effects upon the input, post-discharge and excess
spikes. each of these electrical measures can be related to
a specific part of the nociceptive pathway. the non-potentiated input response can be related to the level of synaptic
transmission between the central terminals of primary afferents and the neurones of the spinal cord dorsal horn.
thus, blockade of t-type channels at this location is likely
causing a reduction in the exocytosis of excitatory neurotransmitters by prohibiting the depolarisation required to
activate high voltage-activated ca2q channels. alternatively,  xxxd2056xxx  could be exerting its effects directly
on neurones located early in polysynaptic pathways. even
more susceptible to the actions of  xxxd2056xxx  were the
postsynaptic nmda receptor-mediated post-discharge and
excess spike measurements. these are indicative of central
sensitisation and neuronal hyperexcitability, and since ttype ca2q channels are heavily linked to the level of
neuronal excitability it follows that they would have a
greater functional role here.
what is surprising is that we saw no difference in the
effects of  xxxd2056xxx  after the establishment of neuropathy, especially since neuronal hyperexcitability is a key
underlying factor. interestingly it has been shown that
although unilateral cortical ablation causes a 68% increase
in t-current measured from isolated rat thalamic relay
neurones, a-methyl-a-phenylsuccimide žanother related ttype channel antagonist. was more effective in reducing
t-current in normal rats compared to axotomised animals
žchung et al., 1993.. the authors suggest an injury induced alteration in the pharmacological properties the ttype channels either by de novo synthesis andror modification. in this study, it may be that there is indeed no
increase in the functional role of t-type ca2q channels
after nerve injury. alternatively, the specificity andror
potency of  xxxd2056xxx  may be such that subtle differences in t-type channel function were not highlighted.
peripheral nerve injury results in reduced afferent input
via l5 and l6 spinal nerves, yet as observed here, the
magnitude of neuronal responses recorded was not diminished in comparison to sham and normal rats. conversely,
increased frequency and occurrence of spontaneous activity was observed. this suggests that perhaps compensatory
increases in peripheral andror spinal neuronal activity are
in play after neuropathy. ectopic c-fibre activity originat-

ing within the dorsal root ganglion, the nerve injury site, or
residual intact afferents provides an ongoing, continual
barrage of neuronal activity via primary afferents into the
spinal cord žwall and devor, 1983; kajander et al., 1992..
evidence suggests that this is one possible source for the
initiation and maintenance of central sensitisation and
therefore the positive sensory symptoms observed after
nerve damage ždevor and seltzer, 1999.. interestingly,
spinal nerve ligation has been shown to increase the
prevalence of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations
in dorsal root ganglion neurones which augments ectopic
discharge žliu et al., 2000.. it does not seem unreasonable
to postulate a role for t-type ca2q channels in this underlying oscillatory behaviour, which may imply increased
activity via t-type channels in the remaining afferents
tantamount to a restoration of excitability to that in the
non-injured situation.
the existence of a neuronal ca2q current elicited just
above the resting potential was first established in primary
sensory neurones žcarbone and lux, 1984; bossu et al.,
1985; fedulova et al., 1985; nowycky et al., 1985., and
low voltage-activated current has since been observed in a
wide variety of cell types žhuguenard, 1996.. the presence of a relatively large t-type current in some superficially located rat spinal dorsal horn neurones is of much
interest because this region is involved in processing and
integration of sensory information, including pain žryu
and randic, 1990.. t-type channels are pharmacologically
and physiologically heterogeneous žakaike, 1991; huguenard, 1996; tarasenko et al., 1997., which may reflect
differential expression of the three known subtypes ž a1g,
h and i.. the regional and cellular distribution of gene
expression for the different t-type ca2q channel family
members in the rat central and peripheral nervous systems
has recently been determined using in situ hybridisation
žtalley et al., 1999.. all three transcripts were detected in
sensory areas and in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
where in particular a1h was mainly restricted to the
outermost laminae i and ii. in the dorsal root ganglion
high levels of a1h and moderate levels of a1i mrna
were found restricted to small and medium sized neurones,
whereas the extremely large were not labelled. this correlates with substantial t-type current observed in mediumdiameter dorsal root ganglion neurones isolated from adult
rats that is absent in larger dorsal root ganglion cells
žscroggs and fox, 1992.. since dorsal root ganglion cell
body diameter is correlated to axon conduction velocity
and sensory modality žyaksh and hammond, 1982., this
evidence is indicative of t-type current specifically localised to smaller ad- and c-type sensory neurones that
convey thermal and nociceptive information and not to
larger ab-type neurones that subserve tactile and proprioceptive pathways. in the present study the extent of inhibition observed with the highest dose of  xxxd2056xxx  was
ad-fibre ) c-fibre) ab-fibre, which fits well with these
studies. however, the ad- and c-fibre responses were not

147

markedly inhibited over the ab-fibre response, as one
might expect if smaller diameter sensory neurones exhibited substantial low voltage-activated ca2q current. also
no difference in the extent of inhibition was observed for
the evoked responses to innocuous and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli. this may again be explained by
the existence of the three a1 subunits, each with a unique
distribution, encoding for t-type ca2q channels. data
suggests that diversity exists between t-currents of different cell types both in terms of kinetics and pharmacological sensitivity žhuguenard, 1996.. for example, the current
clinical use of  xxxd2056xxx  to treat epilepsy is via block
of t-current in thalamic neurones žcoulter et al., 1989a,b..
however, t-current in gh3 cells is relatively resistant to
block by  xxxd2056xxx  žherrington and lingle, 1992. and
in dorsal root ganglion neurones  xxxd2056xxx  is over an
order of magnitude less effective žcoulter et al., 1989a,b..
furthermore, the blockade is complete in dorsal root ganglion but only partial ž40%. in thalamic neurones. a1g is
the predominant subtype found in thalamic relay neurones,
and therefore may be more sensitive to the effects of
 xxxd2056xxx  in comparison to the a1h t-type channel
which is more abundant than a1g in the outer lamina of
the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia žtalley et al.,
1999..
two other licensed anticonvulsants, carbamazepine and
gabapentin, have been investigated using the same experimental protocol as the present study žchapman et al.,
1998.. carbamazepine, a sodium channel blocker, and
gabapentin, thought to act via ca2q channels žsee matthews
and dickenson, 2000. were found to have similar efficacy
and range of effectiveness as  xxxd2056xxx . although both
gabapentin and  xxxd2056xxx  were equally effective in
sham and neuropathic animals, carbamazepine was only
effective in the latter group and this could possibly be a
consequence of differential regulation of ca2q and sodium
channels following nerve injury. to our knowledge the
present study is the first to demonstrate a possible role of
t-type ca2q channels in the spinal processing of sensory
information related to pain. given the parallels between
epilepsy and pain, the likelihood of common causal mechanisms and the ability of antiepileptic drugs to be effective
in neuropathic pain states, the results indicate that  xxxd2056xxx  may merit both behavioural testing in animals and
human studies.
