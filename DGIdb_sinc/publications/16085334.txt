background/aims: in liver cirrhosis atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) decreases portal vascular resistance and
tributary flow. the enzyme  xxxg1417xxx  (nep) degrades anp and bradykinin and generates  xxxg674xxx 
from big-endothelin. we determined the effects of nep inhibition by  xxxd420xxx  on hormonal status, liver function
and arterial and portal pressures in rats with ccl4-induced cirrhosis.
methods: two groups of seven control rats received 1 ml 5% glucose solution alone or containing 10 mg/kg
 xxxd420xxx ; three groups of 10 ascitic cirrhotic rats received placebo, 5 or 10 mg/kg  xxxd420xxx . nep protein
concentration and immunostaining were analyzed in normal and cirrhotic livers.
results: in cirrhotic rats 10 mg/kg  xxxd420xxx  significantly increased steady-state indocyanine green clearance
(a parameter reflecting liver plasma flow) (p!0.01), decreased portal pressure (p!0.01), had no effect on arterial
pressure and plasma renin activity but increased anp plasma levels (p!0.05) and urinary excretions (p!0.01) of anp
and cgmp. in the cytosol fraction of rat cirrhotic livers a 280% increase in nep content was found (p!0.01), chiefly
localized in desmin-positive myofibroblast-like cells of fibrous septa.
conclusions:  xxxd420xxx  has few effects on systemic hemodynamics and hormonal status; its portal hypotensive
action depends on effects exerted on intrahepatic vascular resistance.

1. introduction
in liver cirrhosis, augmented portal tributary blood flow
secondary to splanchnic vasodilatation, and increased
intrahepatic vascular resistance determine portal hypertension [1].
endogenous natriuretic peptides inhibit sympathetic
nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and
 xxxd3495xxx  (avp) secretion, leading to vasodilatation and natriuresis [2]. when infused in cirrhotic patients,
natriuretic peptides decrease hepatic venous pressure
gradient, i.e. portal pressure [3]. in cirrhotic rats the infusion
of brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) and ring-deleted anp
analogues reduced portal tributary blood flow [4,5], but
either physiological or pharmacological doses of anp did
not affect intrahepatic vascular resistance [6]. intraportal
injection of anp did not alter portal flow resistance in
anaesthetized dogs [7]. however, in cirrhotic patients, anp
infusion reduced portal pressure and increased hepatic
blood flow, a finding indicative of anp-induced decrease in
intrahepatic resistance to portal flow [3]. finally, recent data
suggest that  xxxg1586xxx  (cnp) may counteract both liver fibrogenesis and portal hypertension in
chronic liver diseases [8]. since anp administration causes
systemic vasodilatation, decrease in cardiac index, and
hypotension in normal subjects [9] and, to a larger extent, in
patients with cirrhosis [10,11], the use of natriuretic
peptides as portal hypotensive agents is not recommended.
clearance of natriuretic peptides occurs mainly in the
kidney, lung, brain, and heart through binding to natriuretic
peptide clearance receptors (npcrs) or proteolysis by
 xxxg1417xxx  (nep) [12], a membrane-bound
zn-metalloendopeptidase also called  xxxg1417xxx  or ec
3.4.24.11. nep has been found in the brush border
membrane of kidney tubule cells, in bronchial fibroblasts
and epithelial cells, in b lymphoid-progenitors, and in glial
cells [13]. nep degrades opioid-peptides [14], bradykinin
[15],  xxxg977xxx -like peptide [16],  xxxg2240xxx  [17],
endogenous natriuretic peptides [18,19], and  xxxg80xxx  [20], as well as  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) [21] and angiotensin
ii [17]. nep can produce the vasoconstrictor polypeptide
et-1 from circulating precursors (i.e. big et-1 and et-11–
31) [22,23]: the balance between degradation and generation
of et-1 by nep depends on whether the predominant
substrates available for proteolysis are vasodilators, vasoconstrictors, or precursors of vasoconstrictors [24].
nep is inhibited by  xxxd420xxx  and its prodrug
 xxxd419xxx , by  xxxd3357xxx , sinorphan, and  xxxd2936xxx 
[17,25,26]. although nep inhibitors increase plasma
concentrations of natriuretic peptides and cause natriuresis
[25,26] they do not lower arterial pressure in normotensive
subjects [26]. indeed, both  xxxd419xxx  and  xxxd420xxx 
may raise arterial pressure in healthy humans [27]. nep
inhibitors have been reported to lower blood pressure in
patients with essential hypertension [28], a finding later
disputed [29].

this study aimed: (a) to analyze nep protein content and
immuno-localization in normal and cirrhotic rat livers and
(b) to determine the effects of i.v.  xxxd420xxx  on
hemodynamics (i.e. portal pressure and mean arterial
pressure), liver function (measured through indocyanine
green clearance [cicg]), and hormonal status in cirrhotic
rats with ascites induced by chronic administration of ccl4.

2. methods
studies were performed on anaesthetized male adult wistar rats with
cirrhosis and ascites, and on anaesthetized male adult wistar control rats.
both groups were fed ad libitum with standard chow and water as drinking
fluid. cirrhosis was induced by ccl4 (riedel de haen, sigma-aldrich,
seelze, germany), which was administered by gavage twice weekly [30].
cirrhotic rats were studied 12 weeks after starting the cirrhosis induction
program, when ascites was developed. control rats were studied following
a similar period of standardized diet. experiments in rats were performed in
compliance with the procedures outlined in the italian ministry of health
guidelines (no. 86/609/eec) and according to the principles of laboratory
animal care (nih no. 85-23, revised in 1985). the protocol assessed the
urinary, hormonal and portal hemodynamic responses to the i.v.
administration of different doses of the nep inhibitor  xxxd420xxx  (pfizer
central research, sandwich, sussex, england) [25], in 14 control rats and
30 rats with ccl4-induced ascitic cirrhosis.

2.1. animal groups
 xxxd420xxx  was dissolved in 5% glucose solution, obtaining two
different doses, f5 (5 mg/kg) or f10 (10 mg/kg), to be administered
intravenously to the rats in the same volume of fluid (1 ml). the rats were
divided into five groups: seven control rats receiving diluent alone (g1),
seven control rats receiving f10 (g2), 10 cirrhotic rats receiving diluent
alone (g3), 10 cirrhotic rats receiving f5 (g4), and 10 cirrhotic rats
receiving f10 (g5).

2.2. study protocol
the rats were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketavet 100 (farmaceutici gellini, sabaudia, italy) and rompum (xylazine, bayer a.g.,
leverkusen, germany) (4:1 v:v) by intraperitoneal injection (0.5 ml
mixture/200 g b.wt). a constant infusion of indocyanine green (icg)
(cardiogreen; hyson wescott and dunning, baltimore, usa) was carried
out through the caudal vein for 180 min, in order to assess its steady-state
plasma clearance at different times [31,32]. the icg infusion rate was 5 mg/
min (1 ml of icg-containing solution infused per hour). after 90 min of
infusion, laparotomy was performed and the urinary bladder was emptied; a
clamp was positioned on the urethral orifice. cardiac blood was sampled by
cardiac puncture (0.5 cc) (time 1) to assess basal values of cicg. in order to
directly measure portal pressure, a polypropylene catheter (0.7 mm
diameter) was inserted into a small ileal vein and gently advanced to the
bifurcation of the superior mesenteric and the splenic veins. after 10-min
stabilization, basal portal pressure was measured. then, either diluent alone
or  xxxd420xxx  (f5 or f10) was given as a single bolus in the right femoral
vein and portal pressure measurements were repeated after 5 and 15 min.
cardiac blood was sampled (0.5 cc) 15 and 30 min (times 2 and 3) after
 xxxd420xxx  or vehicle injection. each blood withdrawal was replaced
with an equal volume of i.v. saline. blood samples withdrawn at time 2
were used to measure the new icg steady-state plasma levels. blood
samples at time 3 were used for hormonal status determination. blood
samples withdrawn at time 3 from five controls and five cirrhotic rats
infused only with vehicle were used to determine  xxxg2296xxx -a
( xxxg2296xxx ) and interleukin-1 (il-1) serum levels. one hour after  xxxd420xxx 
or vehicle injection, all rats were killed by abdominal aorta exsanguination,
and all urine produced during the 60 min period after  xxxd420xxx  or
vehicle administration was drained through bladder puncture. this urine
volume was used to determine hourly excretions of sodium, potassium,

anp and cgmp. livers were excised and immediately frozen at k80 8c
for bio-molecular determinations. in a further group of five anaesthetized
cirrhotic rats, mean arterial pressure was evaluated by means of tail
sphygmomanometry (blood pressure recorder 8005, wcw electronic,
milan, italy) before and 40 min after 10 mg/kg  xxxd420xxx  i.v.
administration in the caudal vein, without performing laparotomy. the
blood pressure recorder was equipped with a high sensitivity pulse
transducer coupled with a microprocessor program which allowed to
distinguish between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as described in
literature [33,34].

measured using ria (anp shionoria, cis bio international, gif-sur-yvette
cedex, france). plasma renin activity (pra) was determined using ria for
 xxxg99xxx  after an incubation period of 2 h (renin maia kit, biodata,
rome, italy).  xxxg674xxx  plasma concentrations were assayed with a
commercially available kit ( xxxg674xxx  radioimmunoassay, peninsula
laboratories, king of prussia, pa, usa). urinary concentrations of cgmp
were determined using ria (immunotech, marseille, france).

2.7. calculations

2.3. nep protein concentration in rat liver

icg clearance was calculated by the steady-state plasma clearance
formula:

for western blot analysis, tissue specimens were prepared from the
livers of five rats from each experimental group (g1–g5): 500 mg slices
were homogenized  xxxd1891xxx % (w/v) in tris-buffer and centrifuged at 1000 g for
10 min at 4 8c. the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 g for 45 min;
the second supernatants were the cytosolic fraction. nep was detected on
10% homogenates and cytosolic extracts, as described by laemmli et al.
[35]. equal amounts of proteins (60 mg) were separated on 10%
sds-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes.
non-specific binding was blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk in
5 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4, containing 200 mm nacl and 0.05% (v/v) tween
20 (tbs-tween) overnight at 4 8c. blots were incubated with a rabbit
polyclonal antibody raised against nep ( xxxg1417xxx , santa cruz biotechnology)
and then with a goat polyclonal antibody against the receptor associated
protein (rap, santa cruz biotechnology) diluted at 1:1000 in tbs-tween
containing 2% (w/v) non-fat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. after
washing three times for 10 min in tbs-tween, blots were reacted with
peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody in tbs-tween containing 2% (w/v)
non-fat dried milk. following three washing steps in tbs-tween,
immunoreactive proteins were detected with the chemiluminescence
assay (ecl, amersham) and subsequent exposure to film for 2–10 min.
specific bands were quantified by densitometry using analytic software
(bio-rad, multi-analyst, munich, germany); before any comparison the
net intensity of bands in each experiment was normalized to the intensity of
the corresponding rap band, used as an internal standard to evaluate the
degree of non-specific protein expression in this homogenate [36].

2.4. liver nep indirect immunofluorescence
indirect immunofluorescence was performed in a humidified chamber at
room temperature, essentially as described elsewhere [37], on liver cryostat
sections (6 mm thick). mouse monoclonal anti-desmin or anti-asma
(dakocytomation, denmark) and rabbit polyclonal anti-nep ( xxxg1417xxx , santa
cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, california, usa) primary antibodies were
diluted (1:250 and 1:100, respectively) in phosphate buffered saline, ph 7.4,
containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (pbs-bsa). as secondary
antibodies either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit c3y-conjugated antibodies
(amersham biosciences, braunschweig, germany), diluted 1:1000 in
pbs-bsa, as well as fitc-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (sigmaaldrich, milan, italy) diluted 1:200 in pbs-bsa, were used. at the end of
the conventional immunofluorescent staining procedure, liver sections were
washed twice in pbs and stained with the dna fluorescent dye dapi to
visualize liver cell nuclei [38].

where ssp-icg is the steady-state plasma concentration of icg [31,32].
mean arterial pressure (map) was calculated by the usual formula:
1=3ðsystolic blood pressure k diastolic blood pressureþ
c diastolic blood pressure:

2.8. statistical analysis
results are expressed as meansgsd. all comparisons between groups
of rats were made by wilcoxon rank sum test. comparisons between
measurements carried out in the same animal but at different times were
made by wilcoxon signed rank test. correlation coefficients were derived
using spearman’s rank correlation. significance was accepted at the 5%
probability level.

3. results
3.1. liver nep protein expression
we found over-expression of  xxxg1417xxx  in
the whole homogenate from cirrhotic livers (fig. 1); nep
protein content in cytosolic fraction of cirrhotic livers was
roughly three-fold that of healthy animals (fig. 2).

2.5. serum cytokine determinations
serum  xxxg2296xxx  levels were determined using a sensitive elisa kit
(biosource international, camarillo, california, usa) specific for rat  xxxg2296xxx , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. serum il-1 levels were
evaluated using an elisa kit (maoyuan technique co, shanghai, china).

2.6. plasma and urinary determinations
urinary concentrations of sodium and potassium were measured with a
flame photometer. icg plasma concentrations were determined colorimetrically.  xxxd3495xxx  concentrations were measured on edta
plasma using ria (vasopressin direct ria, buhlmann laboratories ag,
postfach, switzerland). anp urinary and plasma concentrations were

3.2. nep immunostaining in liver slices
desmin- and asma-positive stellate and/or myofibroblast-like cells and nep-positive cells were clearly
identified in normal and in cirrhotic liver sections
(fig. 3). immunofluorescent staining for nuclei, desmin
and nep in normal liver sections revealed the
localization of nep in the cytoplasm periphery of
hepatocytes (fig. 4). in cirrhotic liver sections nep
immunostaining was enhanced and associated with
desmin- and asma-positive myofibroblast-like cells in
fibrous septa (fig. 5).

plasma concentrations of avp and et-1 (table 1).
3.5. portal hemodynamics, mean arterial pressure
and hepatic function
in basal conditions cirrhotic rats showed higher portal
pressure than controls. both 5 and 10 mg/kg  xxxd420xxx 
significantly decreased portal pressure in cirrhotic rats. both
 xxxd420xxx  doses increased cicg in cirrhotic rats.
 xxxd420xxx  determined no change of mean arterial
pressure (from 88g17 to 86g20 mmhg, pz0.37) in
cirrhotic rats (tables 2 and 3).

3.7. correlations
both in controls and in all 30 cirrhotic rats we observed
significant correlations between urinary excretions of cgmp
and natriuresis (respectively, r: 0.64, p!0.05 and r: 0.73,
p!0.001). anp and cgmp urinary excretions correlated in
the control group that received vehicle alone (r: 0.82; p!
0.05), but in none of the other groups. we found significant
correlations between urinary excretions of sodium and anp
in control and cirrhotic rats given vehicle alone (respectively, r: 0.81, p!0.05 and r: 0.85, p!0.001) but not in the
 xxxd420xxx -treated groups. no correlation was found
between cytokine serum levels and degree of liver nep
expression.

3.6. urinary excretion parameters
both  xxxd420xxx  doses raised urinary excretion of anp
and cgmp in the cirrhotic groups.  xxxd420xxx  (10 mg/kg)
significantly increased urinary volume and sodium
excretion in cirrhotic rats. compared with cirrhotic rats
receiving vehicle, the cirrhotic groups given both doses
of  xxxd420xxx  had significantly lower values of the cgmp/sodium urinary excretion ratio, suggesting that
potentiation of anp function is not the sole mechanism
that increases natriuresis after nep-inhibition (table 4).

of  xxxd420xxx  reduced portal pressure and increased cicg,
with minimal effects on arterial pressure and hormonal
status in ascitic cirrhotic rats.
in liver cirrhosis mfs are located around portal venous
branches in fibrous septa. contraction of these cells
generates traction forces in the developing scar tissue and
affects intrahepatic resistance to portal flow [39]. this
explains why vasodilator drugs administered into the portal
vein of cirrhotic rats decrease portal pressure [40–42].
the cause of nep over-expression in the cirrhotic liver is
conjectural at the moment. several cytokines enhance nep
expression in fibroblasts, kidney tubular cells, bronchial
epithelial cells and lung neuroendocrine cells [16,36,43],
and nep has been found over-expressed in kidney cortical
tubular cells of rats with congestive heart failure [36] and in
lymphoblasts of acute lymphocytic leukemia [44]. in the
injured liver interleukin-1 (il-1),  xxxg2296xxx -a
( xxxg2296xxx ), and interleukin-6 (il-6) are highly expressed,
exert paracrine functions enhancing inflammation and
deposition of collagen fibers [45], and activate stellate
cells to contractile mfs [46]. in this study, we confirmed
elevated levels of serum cytokines in rats with ccl4-induced
cirrhosis (table 1), but without any correlation with the
degree of liver nep expression.
the increased nep protein expression by desminpositive mfs may lead to enhanced degradation of
vasodilating natriuretic peptides and kinins, as well as to
increased generation of et-1 from big et-1 or et-11–31, in
turn contributing to mfs contraction. nep inhibition may
block this process [15,18,19,22,23].
we found augmented nep protein content both in whole
liver homogenate and in liver cytosolic fraction (fig. 1).
this does not rule out that nep-positive liver cells express
this protein membrane-bound, as occurs in all organs
studied to date, since tissue sample centrifugation may
remove membrane antigens from cellular membranes. even
the trafficking of newly synthesized proteins from rough
endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membrane could

contribute large amount of nep in the cytosolic fraction
of cirrhotic liver homogenate.
in normal liver nep protein was limited to the cytoplasm
periphery of hepatocytes (fig. 4). on the contrary, mainly
desmin-positive activated mfs in septa expressed nep in
cirrhotic livers (fig. 5), and nep-inhibition not only
determined a remarkable portal hypotensive effect
(table 2), but also caused a sizeable increase in cicg. the
value of cicg is mainly dependent on the level of functional
liver perfusion and is not related to functioning liver cell
mass. however, since we did not measure icg hepatic
venous concentrations, we did not compute effective hepatic
plasma flow to rule out the possibility that the drug-induced
cicg increase could represent the improvement of hepatocellular icg extraction, rather than an increase in liver
perfusion [31,32]. at the moment, possible  xxxd420xxx 
effects on portal inflow or blood flow through extrahepatic
porto-systemic shunts remain a mere speculation, as nep
expression appeared to be strictly associated to hepatic mfs,
and no counterpart of these cells has ever been described in
the mesenteric arterial circulation or along extrahepatic
porto-systemic shunts. in addition,  xxxd420xxx  reduced
portal pressure, ruling out a significant drug-induced
mesenteric vasodilation, and anp, whose systemic concentrations increased after  xxxd420xxx , had been found to
decrease portal tributary blood flow [4,5].
nep inhibition did not depress arterial pressure, nor did
it stimulate renin or avp secretion (table 1), in agreement
with literature [26–29]. accordingly, the nep-inhibitor
 xxxd3357xxx  did not alter systemic vascular resistance in
cirrhotic rats [47] and sinorphan actually reduced renin
secretion in cirrhotic patients [48].
the increase in anp plasma levels and in anp and
cgmp urinary excretions after  xxxd420xxx  suggests that
potentiation of endogenous natriuretic peptide action
contributes to the portal hypotensive effect. however, the
decreased ratio between urinary excretions of cgmp and
sodium indicates that potentiation of anp is not the sole

mechanism of  xxxd420xxx  action: when nep inhibition
was accompanied by the administration of receptor
antagonists of bradykinin or  xxxg80xxx , both of these
vasodilators being degraded by nep, blunted natriuretic
effects were found [15,20].
 xxxd420xxx  administration did not affect systemic
plasma levels of et-1 in cirrhotic rats. this is partially at
variance with other studies reporting reduction of plasma
et-1 after  xxxd419xxx  administration in hypertensive rats
[49], or decreased aortic tissue concentration of et-1 after
nep inhibition in rabbits [50].
in summary, we have identified a new target for future
portal hypotensive therapies of cirrhotic portal hypertension. a better understanding of the bio-humoral alterations
occurring in the cirrhotic liver after inhibition of neutral
endopeptidase may also improve the knowledge of the
pathogenesis of portal hypertension.
