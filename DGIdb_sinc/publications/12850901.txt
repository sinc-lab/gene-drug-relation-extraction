association of benzodiazepine injection with the prescription of temazepam capsules.  temazepam capsules have become a popular choice for benzodiazepine injection by injecting drug users, and serious vascular and tissue damage leading to ulcers and gangrene can result. we compared the self-reported benzodiazepine injecting behaviour of 91 heroin users with their pharmaceutical benefits schedule (pbs) records for the preceding 5 years. we found that individuals prescribed pbs temazepam capsules were more likely to report injecting benzodiazepines than individuals who had either not been prescribed pbs temazepam capsules or had been prescribed pbs temazepam tablets. these results provide empirical support for the argument to limit the prescription and supply of temazepam capsules in australia.
