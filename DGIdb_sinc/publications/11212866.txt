abstract
while there are some reports indicating that dopamine (da) and d2-like receptors (rc) are detected in human placenta, there is little evidence available regarding the function of da or the precise
localization of its receptors in this organ. in the present study, we confirmed the placental expression
of da d2 rc transcripts by northern blot analysis. using in situ hybridization, we also first revealed
that da d2 rc mrna was expressed in cytotrophoblasts, syncytial trophoblasts, vascular endothelial
cells, hafbauer cells, and fibroblasts in the chorionic villi of the human placenta. the expression sites
of da d2 rc mrna led us to suspect other functions of da in the placenta besides the regulation of
human placental lactogen. since the cells expressing da d2 rc mrna are related to proliferation and
remodeling of placental tissue, we tried to evaluate a possible involvement of da in the regulation of
placental angiogenesis. to this end, we used the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (cam) assay. in
cam assay,  xxxd200xxx , a potent nonselective agonist of da, has an anti-angiogenic effect. these
results suggest that da may regulate the vascularization of human placenta through its receptors
present in the chorionic villi. © 2001 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

considerably elevated in near-term amniotic fluid [2, 3]. recent studies have demonstrated
the presence of da binding sites [4] and the expression of da  xxxg656xxx  (rc) mrna [5] in
the human placenta, but their precise localization in this tissue has not yet been revealed.
thus, we tried to elucidate the localization of da d2 rc mrna in chorionic villi of the human placenta using in situ hybridization (ish).
placental vascular growth begins early in pregnancy and continues throughout gestation,
and needs vigorous proliferation [6]. there have been numerous reports concerning the antiproliferative effects of da and their rcs [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. in particular,  xxxd372xxx , a da
d2 rc agonist, has been clinically used as a treatment for prolactinoma, with reported reductions in tumor mass [12, 13]. it is reasonable to presume, therefore, that da might participate
in the regulation of placental vascularization.

materials and methods
tissue preparation
this project was approved by the human subject research committee of our university.
human placentas were obtained from the obstetrical service of gyeongsang national university hospital. all placentas used in this study were from healthy women with a normal 38–40
wk delivery. for northern blot analysis, six term placentas were used; three placentas were
obtained for ish. the villous layers of trophoblastic tissue were dissected on ice, cut into
cubes to fit slide glass, and were frozen in prechilled 2-methyl butane for ish. to confirm
that our sections were from the villous layer, we sectioned the tissue, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and observed with light microscopy. for rna extraction, placental tissues were
chopped into small pieces (approximate weight: 100 mg), frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at 270 8c until experimental processing.
northern blot analysis
total cytoplasmic rna was extracted from placenta and rat brain by the acid guanidinium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method [14]. rat brain was obtained from male rats (sprague-dawley, 200–250g body weight) in accordance with the principles of laboratory animal
care (nih publication no. 80-23). rna content was quantified with a260 absorbance. the
da d2 rc cdna was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
from rat brain. primers for cloning were 59tggtctactcctccattgtc 39 beginning at
bp 915 as recorded in ncbi (accession number: x56065, nih, usa) and ending with 59
gactgtcagggttgctatgt 39. the pcr product (396 bp, d2l) which covered the two
isoforms of da rcs (d2l and d2s) was ligated with pgem-t vector (promega, usa) and
used in northern blot and ish analysis. the cdna fragment was labeled by random priming
with a[32p]-dctp (3000 ci/mmol; amersham, usa) as previously described [15]. total
rna (30 ug/lane) was denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in formaldehyde-agarose
gels using a mops buffer (20 mm mops, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm edta, ph 5.5–7.0).
after rna was transferred to a nytran membrane (pore size: 0.45 um, schleicher & schuell)
by diffusion blotting for 18 h, the membrane was exposed to an uv-crosslinker (spectronics

co., new york, usa). hybridization and post-washing were carried out as previously described [16]. after washing, the membrane was then exposed to x-ray film (fuji) at 270 8c
for 3 days.
in situ hybridization
sections (thickness; 12 um) on gelatin-coated slides were made with a cryostat (leicar,
germany) at 220 8c. these sections were fixed and dehydrated as described [17]. briefly,
sections were fixed, acetylated, dehydrated, and treated with chloroform to remove lipid
droplets. after slight rehydration, sections were stored at 270 8c in a tightly sealed plastic
box until hybridization. ish was performed as described [18]. the digoxigenin-11-utp
labeled crna probe was in vitro transcribed (bm, germany) using a cloned partial cdna as
template. hybridization was performed with an antisense or sense probe (50 ng/ml) in a humidified chamber at 42 8c for 18 h. to remove unhybridized probe, sections were washed
and treated with  xxxg1963xxx  (20 ug/ml) in nte buffer (0.5 m nacl, 10 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm
edta, ph 8.0). after washing in buffer i (0.1 m  xxxd2536xxx , 0.15 m nacl, ph 7.5) and immersion in buffer containing 1% blocking reagent (bm, germany) for 1 h at room temperature, these sections were incubated with buffer containing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-dig-antibody (1.5 u/ml, bm, germany) in a humidified chamber at 37 8c for 1 h. after
incubation, sections were washed with buffer ii (0.1 m tris-hcl, 0.1 m nacl, 50 mm mgcl2,
ph 9.5) and buffer i. for color development, sections were incubated in enzyme substrate containing 0.4 mm nbt/ bcip (bm, germany) in the dark for 24 h. the reaction was stopped
with distilled water when color development was thought to be adequate. all ish were undertaken independently at least three times for individual placenta. for identification of individual cell types in the section, neighboring sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin, and observed with a microscope.
chorioallantoic membrane (cam) assay
early-stage cam assay
this procedure was performed as described by struman et al. [19]. on day 3 of development, chicken embryos were removed from their shells and placed in plastic petri dishes. on
day 6, disks (5 mm in diameter) of  xxxd2609xxx  (0.5%, sigma) containing 20 ug of  xxxd200xxx  or haloperidol, and 2 ug of bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) were laid on the chicken cam
as described [20]. for high-dose experiment, a window (1.5 cm wide) was made in the shell
of day 3 fertilized eggs. disks (1 cm in diameter) of  xxxd2609xxx  containing 100 ug of
 xxxd200xxx  or haloperidol, and 2 ug of bsa were placed on the chicken cam. after a 48-h
exposure, white acrylic ink was injected into the chorioallantoic sac for photographic purposes.
late-stage cam assay
on day 10 of development, a window (1 cm wide) was made in the shell of the chicken
embryo. disks (5 mm) of  xxxd2609xxx  containing 20 ug of  xxxd200xxx , haloperidol, and
2 ug of bsa were placed on the chicken cam. in the high-dose experiments, the basic
method was the same as above. after closing the shell with tape, the eggs were returned to
the incubator (37 8c) for 4 days.

vessel counting
for statistical analysis of angiogenesis, the photos of cam results were printed as the actual
egg size and vessels more than 0.1 mm in diameter were counted under a magnifier. the counted
area was restricted to a circle with a 1-cm radius from the center of the  xxxd2609xxx  disk.
statistical analysis
one-way analysis of variance was employed using the graphpad instat software package
(version 1.15). a p value ,0.01 was deemed statistically significant. data are expressed as
mean 6 sem.
results
for elucidation of the existence of da d2 rc mrna in the human placenta, we performed a northern blot analysis using the cloned cdna described in materials and methods.
as shown in figure 1, the representative size of the transcript in northern blot was approximately 2.5 kb both in rat striatum and human placenta, which was consistent with previous
reports [5, 21]. although the probe used in this study was cloned from rat striatum, it was
very homologous (89% in nucleotide sequence) with human da d2 rc and had a unique
sequence different from other da rc subtypes in human (alignment data not shown). our results confirm that the da d2 rc mrna is transcribed in the human placenta.
we performed ish to evaluate the precise localization of da d2 rc mrna in the chorionic villi of human term placenta using an antisense crna probe. figure 2 represents the
small chorionic villi where syncytiotrophoblasts (fig. 2a, b) and trophoblasts (fig. 2c) express the da d2 rc mrna. not all the trophoblastic cells in villi expressed da d2 rc
mrna; they were observed sporadically over the chorionic villous layer.
the da d2 rc mrna was also found in endothelial cells of blood vessels in both small
villi (fig. 2d) and in large stem villi (fig. 3). interestingly, in the large stem villi, the fibroblasts located in the inter-vessel spaces and the hafbauer cells in the villous core showed the

band was 2.5 kb. we performed independent experiments with six normal term placentas and obtained the same
results. the lower part of this figure represents 18s rrna on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.

positive signal of da d2 rc mrna (fig. 3c-d). the specific cell types were determined by
their morphological characteristics after staining with h&e (color photos of h&e-stained
sections are not shown).
in cam bioassays,  xxxd200xxx , a dopamine agonist, showed an anti-angiogenic effect in
and around the disk (fig. 4) at the early stage of cam development. it seemed to inhibit
neovascularization and to demolish preexisting vessels. as a result,  xxxd200xxx  reduced the
vessel number in and around the disk (1 cm in radius from the center of  xxxd2609xxx  disk)
to 30 % compared to bsa and haloperidol treatment. at the late stage, however,  xxxd200xxx  did not show any significant influence on cam. we performed the same experiment
with two different doses of  xxxd200xxx  (20 ug, 100 ug), and similar result from both experiments was obtained. in contrast, haloperidol, an antagonist to da rc, did not affect cam’s
normal development and/or capillary formation at any stage.
discussion
in the present study, we have confirmed the existence of da d2 rc mrna and have revealed for the first time its in situ localization in the chorionic villi of human term placenta.

other previous studies reported that the da d2 rc was localized in trophoblasts of chorionic villi using a ligand binding assay [4], and they regulated the release of human placenta
lactogen (hpl) via inhibition of adenosine 39,59-cyclic monophosphate production [22, 23,
24, 25]. in the present report, using ish, we not only confirm the presence of da d2 rc in
trophoblastic cells of chorionic villi, but also show their presence in the vascular endothelial
cells of small and large stem villi (fig. 2, 3). several previous investigations reported that da
rc existed in the vascular endothelial cells and their functions were related with vasodilation
[26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. placental vascular growth is associated with a continual and dramatic increase in the rate of uterine and umbilical blood flow [6]. when grown to a fully functional
state, placental tissues receive some of the greatest rates of blood flow, on a weight-specific
basis, of any tissue in the body [6, 31]. therefore, it is possible that the vasodilative regulation
of blood vessels occurs in the human placenta via da d2 rc in the vascular endothelial cells.
other cell types aside from trophoblasts and vascular endothelial cells were revealed to
produce da d2 rc mrna, namely hafbauer cells and fibroblasts located in the large stem
villi (fig. 3c-d). their common functions in the chorionic villi are the production of extracellular matrix and remodeling of extracellular stromal materials [32]. thus, it is also possible
that the da d2 rc may participate in the regulation of their function.

from previous reports, other functions for the da and its rc might be proposed. in a normal pregnancy, the synthesis of hpl increases steadily until about the 34th week of pregnancy, and the rate of synthesis decreases until parturition [33]. as described above, one of
the well-known functions of da and its rc in the placenta is an inhibition on the hpl production of trophoblastic cells [22, 23], and the concentration of da greatly increase in the placenta at term [2, 3]. additionally, intact hpl has an angiogenic function, but the n-terminal
16 kda fragment of hpl, which is enzymatically cleaved in the deciduoplacental interface
[34], has an anti-angiogenic property [19]. these studies suggest that da may indirectly participate in angiogenesis of the placenta by regulation of hpl production.
in another aspect, the acutely regulated proliferation of trophoblastic and endothelial cells
in the placenta must be accompanied by the normal functional development of the placenta.
because the vascular endothelial cells of this tissue exhibit mitotic rates equal to or greater

1038

than those observed in tumor endothelial cells, an anti-proliferative agent is necessary for a
normal development of the placenta [35, 36]. thus, it is suggested that da have this function
on trophoblastic and vascular endothelial cells in placental tissues.
since neovascularization involves the remodeling of extracellular matrix, migration and
proliferation of endothelial cells [37], we suspected a direct relationship of da to angiogenesis in the human placenta. to test the effect of da on this process, we used the chicken cam
assay, which is well-known as a potent tool to examine the effect of suspect molecules on angiogenesis in vivo [38, 19]. the cam appears in the yolk sac at 48 h after beginning of development, grows rapidly over the next 6–8 days, and stops growing on day 10 [39]. therefore we performed both an early-stage cam assay (days 6–8) to assess these drug’s effect on
developing capillaries, and a late-stage assay (days 10–14) to test their effect on non-growing
quiescent cam. the results showed that  xxxd200xxx  has an anti-angiogenic effect in earlystage cam development but not in late-stage (fig. 4). although our investigation into  xxxd200xxx ’s function used an avian species, the results do suggest that da may have a role in
the regulation of angiogenesis in the vascular development of the human placenta.
in summary, we first confirmed the in situ-localization of da d2 rc mrna in human placenta to include trophoblasts, hafbauer cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells of blood vessels;
however it is not equally distributed over the tissue. based on these findings and many other
previous reports, we dared to hypothesize that da has an anti-angiogenic effect on human
placenta. using the cam assay, we obtained distinct evidence supporting the hypothesis.
thus, we suggest that da may influence the neovascularization of placental tissue through
da d2 rc during development, although the exact mechanism remains to be investigated.
