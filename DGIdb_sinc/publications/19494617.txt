abstract
secondary hyperparathyroidism is a serious complication of chronic renal disease when
function decline and is characterized by abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphate proﬁle, along with a decline in calcitriol synthesis. a reduced density of speciﬁc receptors for
vitamin d and calcium in several tissues and organs are also present, thus contributing to
parathyroid hyperplasia and abnormal  xxxg1885xxx  synthesis and secretion. this
metabolic derangement is observable early in the course of chronic renal failure (stages 3 and
4) and on this basis it should also be treated early in order to avoid important clinical consequences. to afford secondary hyperparathyroidism, several strategies should be considered:
phosphate oral intake control (diet and phosphate binders), adequate calcium oral intake,
 xxxg2412xxx  activation. more speciﬁcally, the concept of selective  xxxg2412xxx 
activation will be considered as well as its biological effects, the use of  xxxd2851xxx  (a selective  xxxg2412xxx  activator) given orally to patients on peritoneal dialysis, and stages 3
and 4 of chronic renal failure. finally, we will consider a series of nonclassical interesting
potential mechanisms of selective  xxxg2412xxx  activation leading to reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

secondary hyperparathyroidism represents a common and serious complication of chronic kidney disease (ckd) mainly when renal failure occurs
progressively. this condition is characterized by abnormalities in calcium
and phosphorus serum proﬁle, decline in calcitriol synthesis and also reduced

 xxxg2412xxx  and  xxxg343xxx  density in parathyroid glands and well as
in several other tissues and organs.
these conditions lead to parathyroid gland hyperplasia and elevated serum
 xxxg1885xxx  (pth) whose clinical consequences are a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism, characterized by bone abnormalities
related to turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth and strength, often
accompanied by arterial and soft tissue calciﬁcations [1, 2] thus increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
several contributions indicate that this metabolic derangement is present
early in the course of chronic renal failure at stages 3 and 4; levin et al. [3]
showed that when glomerular ﬁltration rate (gfr) declines below 60 ml/min,
serum calcitriol levels also decline while no changes in serum calcium and
phosphorus are observable until terminal uremia occurs. however, when gfr
further declines (<40 ml/min), serum pth proﬁle tends to rise and this has been
considered as an adaptive process for phosphorus homeostasis. on this basis, it
could be assumed that ckd represents a condition of metabolic derangement
to be treated early in order to avoid important clinical consequences.

one of the early triggers of a series of negative metabolic events is represented by the expanded pool of inorganic phosphate due to the reduced renal
excretion capacity to adapt to phosphate oral intake.
in an early phase of ckd, both serum pth and fgf23 are elevated in order
to maximize phosphaturia in the residual nephrons [4]. however, when gfr
declines below 30 ml/min, there are actual possibilities to observe increased
serum phosphate levels; in the majority of these patients, a low phosphate
diet should be successfully prescribed, occasionally along with oral phosphate
binders.
the most traditional combined approach to this condition is the control of
serum phosphorus levels, by reducing oral phosphate intake combined with oral
phosphate binders, associated with the administration of calcitriol in order to
prevent or to treat parathyroid hyperplasia and decrease pth serum levels.
after the ‘aluminum gel era’ (aluminum salts given on a long-term basis
were abandoned in most countries as phosphate binders), calcium carbonate
and calcium acetate proved to be efﬁcacious binders and widely adopted, limited however because possible responsible of increased body calcium pool.
among the 3rd generation of phosphate binders, sevelamer appears to be a
weak binder and the fairly high number of pills often needed to control serum
phosphate poses problems of compliance. during the last decade, lanthanum

carbonate appears to be a much more promising new opportunity for countering hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients because this drug has an efﬁcacious proﬁle similar to aluminum salts without any apparent evidence of bone
or organ toxicity. a survey on long-term-treated patients for 6 years has been
recently published by hutchison et al. [5] who showed no evidence of toxicity
at any level and speciﬁcally at the liver where lanthanum is handled before its
removal through biliary excretion.

 xxxg2412xxx  activators

calcitriol has been widely used in the past decade for controlling pth
secretion and preventing parathyroid hyperplasia. however, its use – as well as
the use of other nonselective agents – might be limited by its potential effects
on serum calcium levels, hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. this condition, in patients undergoing regular dialysis treatment but also in patients at
stages 3, 4 and 5 predialysis, can be related to the development and progression
of vascular calciﬁcation, thus any therapy that could expand calcium load can
potentially exacerbate this process [6, 7].
therefore targeting parathyroid glands with selective  xxxg2412xxx 
activators that also has minimal effects on intestinal calcium absorption should
be considered with priority in uremic patients.

early and new generation  xxxg2412xxx  activators are believed to be
related to the differential interaction with the vitamin d receptors, coactivator
recruitment and cell/tissue selectivity.
these processes at different levels imply a more efﬁcient pth suppression
and minimal effects on intestinal calcium absorption while along minimizing
the negative effects on bone [8, 9].
as an example of the concept of selectivity, studies in uremic rats showed
that while treatment with calcitriol was followed by an increased expression of
intestinal vitamin d receptors, treatment with  xxxd2851xxx  was not. additionally,
a 10-fold dose of  xxxd2851xxx , compared with calcitriol, was needed to produce the same increases in serum calcium levels. the same studies showed no
increase in serum phosphate at any  xxxd2851xxx  dose, whereas calcitriol was
associated with signiﬁcant increases [10, 11].
in summary,  xxxd2851xxx  biological effects from preclinical studies can be
summarized as follows (table 1):

these data were more recently conﬁrmed by lund et al. [12], who showed
a 17% overall decrease in calcium absorption relative to calcitriol in a group of
hemodialysis patients in a double-blind crossover study. this study also showed
that the appropriate  xxxd2851xxx /calcitriol ratio to suppress pth equally in both
groups was 3:1.
several other investigators also showed similar ﬁndings, clarifying the different mechanisms of the reduced intestinal calcium absorption likely due to
the different effect of calcitriol and  xxxd2851xxx  in increasing calbindin expression, which plays a role in modulating calcium absorption [13].
selective  xxxg2412xxx  activator therapy also showed beneﬁcial
effects on bone metabolism.  xxxd2851xxx  showed less stimulation of bone resorption than calcitriol and  xxxd1935xxx , as measured by less increases in serum
phosphorus levels [14, 15].

the oral preparation became available in 2006 in the us and in the following
years in several european countries. its use is basically the prevention and the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic renal failure stages
3, 4 and 5 predialysis as well as in patients on peritoneal dialysis (pd).
a recent prospective randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter study was designed to evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of  xxxd2851xxx 
capsules in both peritoneal and hemodialysis patients and the results were published last year by ross et al. [16].
the primary endpoints were the achievement of 2 consecutive >30%
decreases from baseline ipth levels and the achievement of 2 consecutive
serum calcium values >11.0 mg/dl. patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 27) or  xxxd2851xxx  (n = 61) for a 12-week period.

based on ipth, calcium and phosphate values. it should be underlined that
both pd or hemodialysis (hd) patients, whose mean basal ipth was 730 pg/
ml, showed a rapid control of ipth levels during the ﬁrst 2 weeks of therapy
(>40%) so that  xxxd2851xxx  doses were drastically reduced from a mean of 33.7
pg weekly doses to 16.9 pg after 4 weeks of therapy.
additionally, a statistically greater proportion of both hd and pd  xxxd2851xxx  patients [83% (33/40) and 100% (18/18), respectively] achieved 2 consecutive >30% decreases in ipth. the treatment groups were not statistically
different in terms of hypercalcemia safety end point. phosphate binder use and
mean serum phosphorus levels were not different between the treatment groups.
finally, the marker of bone activity improved in the treated subjects and worsened in those on placebo.
this study showed that  xxxd2851xxx  provides a rapid and important reduction of pth in both hd and pd patients, with minimal effects on serum calcium
and phosphate. no adverse effects were observed as compared with placebo
(table 2).

associated with improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality outcomes in
patients with stage 5 ckd [17–19].
several researches are also elucidating a variety of nonclassical vitamin
d receptor activator effects in cardiovascular tissues in terms of control of
vascular cell proliferation, inﬂammation, and vascular calciﬁcation (table 3).
more speciﬁcally, calcitriol and mainly  xxxd2851xxx  proved to have inhibitory
effects on cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, suppression of the renin-angiotensin
system, anti-inﬂammatory, antiatherogenic and antithrombotic effects [20]. in
addition, direct beneﬁcial effects of selective  xxxg2412xxx  activators on
glomerular remodeling and on proteinuria have also been documented, even in
patients already treated with ace inhibitors, likely relating to modulation of
structural proteins, growth factors and cytokines [21]. these data were more
recently conﬁrmed by alborzi et al. [22] who conducted a pilot study in which
24 patients, affected by chronic renal failure at stages 2 and 3, were allocated
to daily receive 0, 1 or 2 mug of oral  xxxd2851xxx  for 1 month. these authors
showed that even a small daily dose of  xxxd2851xxx  (1 mug) was able to signiﬁcantly reduce albumin excretion rate along with a signiﬁcant reduction of the
levels of high sensitivity  xxxg520xxx . all patients showed no change in
iothalamate clearance, 24-hour blood pressure or  xxxg1885xxx  with
treatment or on washout.
all these pleiotropic effects related to the modulation of gene expression
have the potential to ameliorate the development and progression of cardiovascular disease and reduce mortality in patients with any level of chronic renal
failure.
an evaluation of both the classical and nonclassical effects of vitamin d
receptor activators in patients with ckd indicates that a selective vitamin d
receptor activation should be the treatment of choice with regards to maximize

the control of serum pth while minimizing the possible deleterious calcemic and phosphatemic effects, as well as providing beneﬁts on cardiovascular
comorbidity and renal disease progression.
