potent inhibition of tubulin polymerisation and proliferation of paclitaxel-resistant 1a9ptx22 human ovarian cancer cells by albendazole.  resistance to paclitaxel (ptx) is a major concern in treating ovarian cancer. thus, agents effective in taxane-resistant tumours are highly sought. it has recently been shown that albendazole (abz) is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, angiogenesis and tumour growth. this study was designed to examine the efficacy of abz in ptx-resistant human ovarian cancer 1a9ptx22 cells.
