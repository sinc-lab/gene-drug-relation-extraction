some  xxxd208xxx  metabolites might be among the intracellular signalling
substances that regulate hormone release. we report that the  xxxg1759xxx 
and diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor  xxxd3060xxx  (1- 10 pmoll-i) inhibited the
thyroliberin stimulated prolactin (rprl) production in a dose-dependent way
in a rat pituitary tumour cell line (gh4ci cells). the lipoxygenase inhibitor
nafazatrom (5-50 pmol - i ) also dose-dependently inhibited the thyroliberin stimulated rprl production, while the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin
had no such effect on rprl production. the inhibitors of the  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism ( xxxd3060xxx , etya and nafazatrom) had no effect on the accumulation of inositolpolyphosphates indicating that the  xxxd208xxx  metabolites are not involved in the regulation of the phospholipase c activity.

several signalling systems including liberation of
 xxxd208xxx  from membrane phospholipids
are involved in the regulation of prolactin
(rprl) production and release from lactotrophs [ 1, 21.  xxxd208xxx  liberated in lactotrophs may be metabolized either by
cyclooxygenase to prostaglandins and related
substances [3] or by lipoxygenases to leukotrienes and related substances [3].
the g h cells are among several clonal strains
of rat pituitary tumour cells and this cell line is

widely used to study both production and
release of rprl [4-61. in the gh cells thyroliberin (trh) stimulates both rprl production
and release [5, 61. trh activates a phospholipase c leading to increased intracellular concentrations of (1,4,5)inositoltriphosphate (ip3),
( [ca ii ) as
diacylglycerol (dg) and ca
well as changes in the electrophysiological membrane properties [7, 81. we have recently reported that  xxxd208xxx  metabolites are
involved in the regulation of stimulated rprl

that  xxxd208xxx  metabolites also have
effects on stimulated but not basal rprl
production.

measurements of inositol(po1y)phosphates
the inositol monophosophate (ipl), inositolbiphosphate (ip2) and inositoltriphosphate
(ip3)were measured by anion exchange chromatography after steady state labelling with
3h-labelled  xxxd2360xxx  as previously described
[14]. separation of the inositol phosphate isomers was not attempted.

chemicals
trh and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid
(etya) were purchased from roche (basel,
switzerland), indomethacin,  xxxd3060xxx  from
sigma chemical co (st. louis, mo), nafazatrom from bayer (leverkusen, germany),
ham's f-10 medium from flow laboratories
(irvine, uk).

cell viability
none of the substances tested was toxic to the
cells in the concentration used as determined by
the degree of cell attachment and by the trypan
blue exclusion test.
statistical method

cell culture
the establishment of three strains of epithelial
cells (gh cells) from a transplantable rat pituitary tumour (mtt/ws) was performed by tashjian et al. [lo]. in the experiments to be reported
here the gh4ci strain, which mainly secretes
rprl was used. cells were grown as monolayer
cultures as previously described [l 11.
hormone production
to study the rprl production the cells were
subcultivated and cultured in dishes (costar diameter 6cm) with hams f-10 medium supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) horse serum and 2.5%
(v/v) foetal calf serum, penicillin (100.000
iei-'), streptomycin (100.000 iei-i) anti
pplo (tylocin) (12mgl-') and  xxxd164xxx 
(amphotericin) (2.5mgl-' ) (f-lo+) for totally
8 days. after 2 days with f-10+ the medium
was changed to f-10+ with or without the substances tested and the medium was changed each
second to third day. the culture medium for the
last 24h was collected, centrifuged to remove
cells, and frozen (-20 "c) before measurements
of rprl by ria as previously described [12].
because rprl is neither degraded intracellularly nor in the culture medium, the rprl accumulation during the last 24 h reflect the rprl
production during that period [131.
the cell number in each dish was measured
using a vda 140 particle analyser (analysinstrument ab, stockholm, sweden).

all experiments were repeated at least three
times, and the results are expressed as mean
f s d of triplicates from one representative
experiment if not otherwise stated.

10 pmol 1-' ) of  xxxd3060xxx  while 5 pmol l-'
reduced the trh stimulated rprl production
to about 40% (fig. 1). the same concentrations of  xxxd3060xxx  did not modify the cell number or the cell viability.
an inhibitor of both the lipoxygenase and
cyclooxygenase pathway, etya [ 161, inhibited
the trh (1 pmol i-')-stimulated rprl production dose dependently (fig. 2). the highest concentration of etya used, 50pmol i-', almost
abolished the stimulatory effect of trh.

tion was reduced to about 40% of the maximal
response (fig. 3), while higher concentrations of nafazatrom (100-200pmo1 i-') more
potently reduced the trh stimulated rprl production. they also reduced the cell viability to
about 80% and clearly decreased the cell number in the treated dishes (data not shown).
the effect of inhibitors of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism on the accumulation of inositoltriphosphate (zp3)
torjesen et al. [14] have demonstrated
that trh rapidly and strongly stimulates
the production of ip3 with maximal effect at
about 5 s. neither  xxxd3060xxx  ( 5 - 10 pmol 1-i),
etya (20-50 pmoll-i) nor nafazatrom
(10-50pmo11-') had any effect on the basal
or trh stimulated ip3 production as shown
for the highest concentrations used in fig. 4.
neither did the inhibitors modify the production of ip2 nor ip (data not shown).
even when the gh4c1cells were preincubated
with the  xxxd208xxx  metabolism inhibitors
for 20 min before the trh stimulation, no effect
on the ip3 production was observed neither at
5s nor at 120s (data not shown).

studied.  xxxd208xxx  and its metabolites
seem to be important cellular mediators in the
regulation of different biological processes including stimulated synthesis and secretion from different cell types [18].  xxxd208xxx  and
agents that release  xxxd208xxx  from the
cell membrane, have been reported to stimulate
the rprl secretion from both normal rat pituitary cells and from gh cells [l, 9, 15, 19-21].
in gh4ci cells, a subclone of the gh cells,
several secretagogues stimulate rprl secretion
(eg trh, vip, camp analogues, high extracellular kci, ca channel agonists), and inhibition of the metabolism of  xxxd208xxx 
attenuated the stimulatory effects of all these
substances [6]. in the gh& cells trh also is
a potent stimulator of the rprl production in
gh cells [5]. however, little is known about
the role of  xxxd208xxx  metabolites in the
regulation of rprl production.
since rprl is neither degraded in the extracellular medium nor intracellularly in gh& cells
[ 131, the accumulation of rprl in the extracellu-

lar medium is well correlated to the synthesis of
rprl. our results demonstrated that apart from
the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, the
inhibitors of the enzymes involved in liberation
and metabolism of  xxxd208xxx  dose-dependently inhibit the trh stimulated rprl production without having effect on the basal
rprl production.  xxxd3060xxx , an inhibitor of
both the pla2 and diacylglycerol-lipase [15],
almost completely abolished the stimulatory
effect of trh, indicating that  xxxd208xxx 
release may be necessary for the stimulatory
effect of trh on rprl production. this observation is in agreement with previous reports
where release of  xxxd208xxx  (either by
plaz or mellitin) or inhibition of pla2 modulates rprl release [9, 15, 20-211.
the acetylene analogue to  xxxd208xxx ,
etya, inhibits both the cyclo-oxygenase and
the lipoxygenases [16]. the trh stimulated
rprl production was inhibited by etya indicating that the  xxxd208xxx  metabolites
most probably are involved in stimulated rprl

prl production and inhibitors of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism

production. however, etya in concentrations
higher than iopmoll-' seems to activate the
protein kinase c [22] as well as other signalling
systems such as adenylate cyclase and guanylate
cyclase [22], indicating that etya does not selectively inhibit cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenases. the effects reported in gh4c1 cells
cannot be explained by these unselective effects
of etya since the activation of pkc in
gh4cl cells stimulated rprl release [23] and
rprl production (t. bjerro unpublished observations) and stimulation of adenylate cyclase
in gh4ci cells increased the rprl release [i i].
the reports describing the effects of the cyclooxygenase products on rprl release are conflicting. some claim stimulatory effects [24],
while others maintain that cyclo-oxygenase products are not involved in basal or stimulated
rprl release neither in normal pituitary cells
nor in other cell lines [2,9, 15, 19,211. the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin [25] did not
modify the basal or the trh stimulated rprl
production in the present investigation. however, the same concentrations of indomethacin
have previously been shown to potentiate the stimulatory effect of secretagogues on rprl secretion [9, 151 in agreement with naor et al. [26]
who demonstrated that indomethacin potentiated the stimulatory effect of gonadotrophin
releasing hormone on lh secretion. one explanation for this finding might be increased substrate for the lipoxygenases when the cyclooxygenase is inhibited. in all, the reports mentioned above the incubation periods were short
and the effects mainly observed on the hormone
secretion. we found no effects in our experiments due to loss of the potentiating effects
over several days of treatment.
how the  xxxd208xxx  metabolites are
involved in the regulation of rprl production
and secretion is still not known to the full extent.
previously we have reported that pla2 in concentrations that stimulate rprl secretion has
no effect on the camp production in gh4ci
cells and furthermore, the inhibitors indomethacin and nafazatrom do not inhibit the vip or
 xxxd1742xxx  stimulated camp production in
gh4ci cells [9]. in the present study we report
that these inhibitors had no effect on the inositolpolyphosphate formation in gh4ci cells.
however, in the presence of the lipoxygenase
inhibitor, nafazatrom trh stimulated increase
in the [ca2+], was significantly decreased

1 15

(t. bjsro et al., unpublished), indicating that
the  xxxd208xxx  metabolites are involved
in the regulation of [ca2+]i at a step distal to
the production of inositolpolyphosphates.
camoratto & grandison [27] demonstrated
that rh 80267, a diacylglyserollipase inhibitor,
reduced both rprl secretion and ca2+ influx
in gh3 cells indicating that the arachidonic
acid metabolites interfere with the intracellular
concentration of ca2+.
it is difficult to say if the demonstrated effects
of the inhibitors of the  xxxd208xxx  metabolism have physiological importance of if they
just reflect pharmacological effects of the substances tested.
in conclusion,  xxxd208xxx  metabolites
and most probably the lipoxygenase products
increase the rprl production and secretion
probably by regulating the [ca2+iiwithout interfering with the adenylate cyclase system [9] or
the plc system as reported here.
