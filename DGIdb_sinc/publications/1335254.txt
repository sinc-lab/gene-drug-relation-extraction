abstract---gauium, a pharmacologically important metal which resembles iron, was shown in previous
studies to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. to better understand its mechanism of action, we have
examined the interaction of gallium with the iron-dependent m2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase.
in its active form, m2 contains an iron center and a tyrosyl free radical which is detectable by esr
spectroscopy. in the present study, cytoplasmic extracts prepared from murine leukemic l1210 cells
after an 18-hr incubation with 960/~m  xxxd2175xxx  displayed a > 60% inhibition in their m2 tyrosyl
radical esr signal. however, this signal was restored within 15 min to levels greater than that of
controls by the addition of increasing concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate. gallium citrate
added directly to cytoplasmic extracts from control cells also decreased the tyrosyl radical signal, an
effect which could be reversed by iron. immunoblot analysis revealed that incubation with gallium did
not diminish the amount of m2 protein in cells, thus indicating that the decrease in the tyrosyl radical
signal was not due to a decrease in cellular m2 content. in immunoprecipitation studies of 59fe-labeled
m2, gallium displaced 55-60% of the 59fe incorporated into m2. our studies suggest that gallium
displaces iron from the m2 subunit of ribonueleotide reductase, resulting in a loss of the tyrosyl radical
and an accumulation of inactive m2 within the cell.

gallium, a group i i i a metal, has gained clinical
importance recently as a pharmacologic agent
for the treatment of hypercalcemia and certain
malignancies [1,2]. although gallium is not a
transition element, many aspects of its chemistry
resemble those of iron. the ionization potentials,
ionic radii, and the coordination number of the
aqueous +3 cations are similar for both the metals.
the remarkable similarity between gallium and iron
allows for the interaction of gallium with various
iron-containing proteins. it is known that gallium
avidly binds to the iron transport protein transferrin,
resulting in stable transferrin-gailium complexes [3],
which can be incorporated into cells via transferrin
receptor-mediated endocytosis [4,5]. the cytotoxicity of gallium can be enhanced significantly
when cells are exposed to gallium as transferringallium rather than  xxxd2175xxx  [6]. in addition,
exposure of cells to transferrin-gallium results in a
decrease in iron uptake, an increase in cellular
transferrin receptors and a decrease in ferritin
content, findings consistent with cellular iron
deprivation [6].
the importance of iron in d n a synthesis is related
in part to the activity of the enzyme ribonucleotide
reductase which catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. mammalian

ribonucleotide reductase consists of two nonidentical subunits termed m1 and m2 [7]. the m1
subunit contains the substrate and the effector
binding sites, while the m2 subunit contains nonheme bridged iron atoms and a tyrosyl free radical
which gives a characteristic signal on esr
spectroscopy [8]. the activity of ribonucleotide
reductase is linked closely to the tyrosyl radical and
the presence of iron. removal of this iron results in
the loss of both the tyrosyl radical esr signal and
enzyme activity [8, 9].
in prior studies, we have shown that exposure of
hl60 cells to transferrin-gallium results in a decrease
in deoxyribonucleotide pools and a loss of the tyrosyl
radical esr signal. this inhibited esr signal can
be restored by co-incubation of cells with hemin
[10]. more recently, gallium was found to directly
inhibit the synthesis of dcdp and d a d p [11]. to
obtain a better insight into the mechanism of
action of gallium, we have extended our earlier
investigations to examine the direct effect of gallium
on the tyrosyl radical in cell-free preparations and
show that this effect can be modulated by
the addition of exogenous iron. furthermore,
immunoprecipitation studies of 59fe-labeled m2
protein from a hydroxyurea-resistant, ribonucleotide
reductase over-expressing cell line suggest that
gallium inhibits the m2 subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase by displacing iron from the subunit.

immunoadsorbent (goat antibody to rat igg

was obtained from calbiochem (la jolla, ca). rat
monoclonal antibody (moab) jb4 against the m2
subunit of mouse ribonucleotide reductase [12] was
provided by dr. lars thelander (university of
ume~, sweden). 59fec13 was obtained from new
england nuclear (boston, ma) and 59fe-tf was
prepared as previously described [6].
cell culture and preparation of cell extracts. murine
leukemic l1210 cells were obtained from the
american type culture collection (rockville, md)
and were maintained in an atmosphere of 6% coz
at 37° in rpmi 1640 medium containing 10% horse
serum. for esr studies, large volumes of cells were
required and cells were plated in 500 ml spinner
flasks in the absence (control) or presence of 960/tm
 xxxd2175xxx . after an 18-hr incubation, cells
(5 x 108/flask) were harvested and washed twice
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), and
cell homogenates were prepared as previously
described for assay of ribonucleotide reductase
enzyme activity in cell-free extracts [11]. the final
cytosolic sample containing ribonucleotide reductase
was dialyzed against t r i s - d t r buffer (0.02 m trisci, ph 7.4, containing 1 mm dtt) and concentrated
using a centricon 30 microconcentrator (amicon
corp., danvers, ma). for studies involving labeling
of the ribonucleotide reductase m2 subunit with 59fe
and immunoprecipitation (described below), we
used a hydroxyurea-resistant l1210 subline which
was developed by growth of l1210 cells in medium
in which hydroxyurea was increased in a step-wise
fashion from 0 to 250/~m over a 6-month
period. hydroxyurea-resistant cells were routinely
maintained in medium containing 250/~m hydroxyurea, displayed growth kinetics similar to the wild
type cells, and were approximately 16-fold more
resistant to growth inhibition by hydroxyurea.
when compared with the parent cell line, these
hydroxyurea-resistant cells contained more m2
protein and over-expressed the m2 tyrosyl radical
esr signal by at least an order of magnitude. these
findings are consistent with drug resistance to
hydroxyurea, as reported by others [13-15].
esr spectroscopy studies. esr studies of the
tyrosyl free radical of ribonucleotide reductase were
performed at the national biomedical esr center
of the medical college of wisconsin. x-band esr
spectra were obtained by using a standard century
series varian e-100 spectrometer operating at xband (9 to 9.5 ghz) with 100 khz field modulation.
esr measurements were made on frozen cytosolic
preparations (4 mm diameter x 3 cm long icicles) at
- 1 9 6 ° in quartz finger dewar flasks. after obtaining
initial spectra of cytosolic preparations from control
and gallium-treated cells, the samples were thawed

and ferrous ammonium sulfate/gallium citrate was
added to each sample. following a 15-min incubation
at 37° in air, the samples were frozen again and a
second series of esr measurements were made.
each of the esr spectra was recorded 9-16 times
and averaged with a computer program called
viking. the absolute concentration of the tyrosyl
radical was determined by comparison of the areas
under the double integral of the esr signal to a
1 mm copper perchlorate standard.
measurement of gallium content in cells. gallium
content in cells was determined using a modification
of a previously described fluorometric method [16],
which is based on the reaction of gallium with
salicylaldehyde thiocarbohydrazone (satch). the
reagent satch was synthesized by the condensation
of salicylaldehyde with thiocarbohydrazide and a
1 mm satch solution was prepared in 100%
ethanol [17]. following incubation with gallium
nitrate, cells (1 x 108 cells) were washed with icecold pbs (10mm sodium phosphate, ph7.5,
150mm naci) and centrifuged at 1000rpm for
10 min. concentrated hno3 (5 ml) was added to
the pellet and the sample was digested in a round
bottom flask in a reflux apparatus for 45 min with
drop-wise addition of 5 ml of 30% h202. after
digestion, the samples were evaporated to a small
volume (<0.5 ml), cooled, neutralized with sodium
hydroxide, and diluted to 10 ml with deionized
water.
for determination of gallium content, various
concentrations ofgauium standard (atomic absorption grade, 10 #g/ml) and cell digests were used.
sodium thiosulfate (0.3 ml of a 0.1% solution) and
sodium fluoride (25 jul of a 0.1% solution) were
added to 250/~l sample (cell digest or gallium
standard) and the mixture was incubated for 5 min
at room temperature. the following reagents were
then added: 1.6ml of 0.1 m potassium hydrogen
phthalate buffer, ph2.3, 4 m l of 100% ethanol,
1.2 ml of satch and deionized water to yield a
final volume of 10ml in each assay tube. the
reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature
for 30min. the fluorescent intensity of each
sample was then measured with a spf-500 ratio
spectrofluorometer (american instrument co.,
silver spring, md) using an excitation wavelength
of 395 nm and an emission wavelength of 445 nm.
a standard curve was generated from the fluorescent
intensities of samples containing known concentrations of gallium, and the gallium content in
cell samples was determined from this curve. cell
digests from control cells (grown without gallium)
were used as background blanks.
detection of m2 protein by immunoblotting.
cytosolic extracts from cells incubated without or
with 960/~m gallium were analyzed for m2 protein
content by immunoblotting using a commercially
available chromogenic immunoblotting assay
(immun-blot assay kit, bio-rad, richmond, ca).
previous studies have established the use of moab
jb-4 for detection of m2 protein by this method
[18]. fifteen micrograms of total protein from the
extracts was loaded onto ba83 nitrocellulose
membrane using a 96-well minifold apparatus
(schleicher & schuell inc., keene, nh). after

inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase m2 subunit by gallium
incubation of the membrane in blocking buffer (3%
gelatin in 50 mm tris, 100 mm naci, ph 7.5), m2
protein was detected by probing the membrane with
buffer (1% gelatin, 50mm "iris, 100ram naci,
ph7.5) containing jb4 moab against the m2
protein, followed by incubation in buffer containing
goat anti-rat igg alkaline phosphatase conjugate.
the membrane was then incubated in color
development reagent according to recommendations
of the manufacturer and the intensity of the color
of the dots was compared. no color reaction was
detected in control dots loaded with 50 ?tg bovine
 xxxg124xxx .
the findings on dot blotting were verified further
by western blot analysis of the cytoplasmic
extracts. sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (sds--page) of extracts from cells
incubated without or with 960/~m gallium lysates
was performed according to the method of laemmli
[19]. proteins were transferred from the gel onto
nitrocellulose membrane as described by towbin et
al. [20], using a transblot system (bio-rad). as in
the dot blot method described above, immunoreactive m2 protein was detected using anti-m2
moab as the probe.
immunoprecipitation of s9fe-labeled m2 protein.
to determine the interaction of gallium with the
iron center of the m2 subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase, cells or cell lysates were labeled with 59fe
and the sgfe-m2 protein was immunoprecipitated
using an approach similar to that described by
mcclarty et al. [21]. to obtain sufficient 59fe cpm
incorporation into the m2 protein, a hydroxyurearesistant subline of l1210 cells possessing increased
ribonucleotide reductase activity was used for these
studies. cells were labeled with 59fe under two
conditions: (a) hydroxyurea-resistant l1210 ceils
were incubated for 18 hr with 59fe-tf in growth
medium containing i% horse serum. cells were
washed and homogenized, and the soluble cytosolic
fraction containing 59fe-labeled proteins was used
for immunoprecipitation; (b) unlabeled lysates from
control cells were incubated with 59fecl3 for 15 min
at 37° in air, after which immunopreci~itation was
carried out. immunoprecipitation of the 9fe-labeled
m2 protein was performed using a double-antibody
method. samples were incubated without (control)
or with 5 ~tg jb4 moab to mouse m2 protein for
90 rain at 37°. then 1.1 vol. of tachisorb (goat
antibody to rat igg) was added and the incubation
continued for an additional 45min at room
temperature. following this, the tubes were
centrifuged and the radioactivity in the pellet
(representing ~gfe-labeled m2 protein) was counted.
specific incorporation of sgfe into m2 was calculated
by subtracting the 59fe cpm precipitated in control
samples from the cpm immunoprecipitated by antim2 antibody. to examine the effect of gallium on
59fe bound to m2 protein, samples were incubated
with 1-3 mm gallium citrate for 30 min at 37° prior
to immunoprecipitation. in separate experiments, it
was determined that 3 mm gallium citrate did not
interfere with the binding of the antibody to the m2
protein.

fig. 1. effect of iron on the relative intensity of the m2
tyrosyl radical esr signal from control and gallium-treated
cells. esr studies were performed on cytoplasmicextracts
prepared from cells incubated for 18 hr without (control)
or with 960/~mgalliumnitrate (gn). after obtaining initial
esr spectra, samples were thawed and incubated with
ferrous ammonium sulfate for 15 rain at 370 in air. data
shown represent esr spectra obtained on the same
samples following the consecutive addition of increasing
concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate. the relative
amplitudes of the esr signals are in arbitrary units. the
amplitude of the esr signal of control cells prior to the
addition of iron is expressed as 100% and all other values
shown are relative to this.

incubated with  xxxd2175xxx . following an 18-hr
incubation of l1210 cells with 960#m gallium
nitrate, cytosolic extracts were prepared and analyzed
by esr spectroscopy. figure 1 shows that the m2
subunit tyrosyl radical signal in the cytosol from cells
incubated with  xxxd2175xxx  was decreased by
> 60%. upon incubation of cytosols with increasing
concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate for
15 min at 37°, there was a progressive increase in
the esr signals from control and gallium-treated
samples. interestingly, the addition of ferrous
ammonium sulfate resulted in a larger increase in
the intensity of the tyrosyl radical signal in the
cytosolic extract from gallium-treated cells than in
the control. figure 2 shows the changes in the tyrosyl
radical esr spectra in cytosolic extracts following
the addition of ferrous ammonium sulfate and/or
gallium citrate. the addition of 10~tm ferrous
ammonium sulfate to cytosolic extracts from galliumtreated cells resulted in recovery of the tyrosyl
radical esr signal (compare spectra a with b in
fig. 2). the addition of gallium citrate to the same
sample resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of
the signal (spectra c and d, fig. 2); however, the
esr signal could again be restored to its prior level
with further addition of ferrous ammonium sulfate
(spectrum e).
m2 protein content following incubation of cells
with  xxxd2175xxx . since the decrease in the tyrosyl
radical signal after incubation of intact cells with
gallium could result from a decrease in m2 protein
content, cytosolic extracts from cells were analyzed
for m2 protein by immunoblotting. as shown in fig.

content in gallium-treated cells, as analyzed by dot
blotting, remained comparable to that of controls
over the 18-hr incubation. this finding was confirmed
by western blotting shown in fig. 3b which revealed
two immunoreactive bands of approximately 44 and
88 kda, consistent with the monomeric and dimeric
forms of m2 protein (the 88 kda band most likely
represents unreduced m2). again, comparable
amounts of m2 protein were detected in both control
and gallium-treated cells. these studies clearly
indicate that the decrease in the tyrosyl radical signal
following incubation with gallium was not the result
of a decrease in m2 protein in cells.

the studies described above were performed on
cytosolic extracts from cells that had been incubated
with  xxxd2175xxx  for 18 hr and displayed a baseline
decrease in the esr signal. to examine the effect
of gallium on the tyrosyl radical signal from cells
not previously exposed to gallium, increasing
concentrations of gallium citrate were added
sequentially to the cytosolic extract of l1210 cells.
as shown in fig. 4, a progressive diminution in the
intensity of the m2 tyrosyl radical signal was seen
with the addition of gallium citrate. a 60% inhibition
of the esr signal was seen with 16mm gallium
citrate (not shown). figure 4 also shows that the
inhibitory effect of 9 mm gallium on the tyrosyl
radical was reversed completely with the addition of
20mm ferrous ammonium sulfate to the sample.
these studies, utilizing cytosolic extracts from both
gallium-treated and control cells, suggest that the
inhibitory effect of gallium on the m2 subunit tyrosyi
radical involves interaction with the iron center of
the m2 protein.

discussion
this conclusion was further confirmed by the

120

that gallium was able to displace 59fe from
radiolabeled m2.
the present studies therefore suggest strongly that
the m2 protein present in cells after incubation with
gallium exists mainly as inactive apom2 or as an
inactive form containing gallium in place of iron (or
a combination of both). either situation would result
in a loss of the tyrosyl radical e s r signal and an
inhibition of overall enzyme activity.
in conclusion, our studies have further elucidated
the interaction of gallium with the iron-dependent
m2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and have
provided an additional insight into the mechanism
by which gallium inhibits d n a synthesis. it is
likely that gallium targets other intracellular irondependent processes and studies are in progress to
examine these interactions.
