mode of action of fibrates in the regulation of triglyceride and hdl-cholesterol metabolism.  epidemiological studies have shown that hypertriglyceridemia and low hdl-cholesterol were both associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia is now recognized as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. secondary prevention trials (e.g., locat, becait, bip and dais) in coronary artery disease with drugs acting primarily on triglycerides (e.g., the  xxxg1805xxx  activators  xxxd331xxx ,  xxxd2096xxx  and gemfibrozil) have shown that reducing triglycerides and increasing hdl-cholesterol, without significantly affecting ldl-cholesterol, slows down coronary artery luminal narrowing. furthermore, the va-hit study recently showed that gemfibrozil decreased coronary artery disease mortality in secondary prevention trials, partly by increasing hdl-cholesterol. the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) (i.e.,  xxxg1805xxx , -beta(delta) and -gamma) form a subfamily of the nuclear receptor gene family. whereas all ppars are, albeit to differing extents, activated by  xxxd2154xxx  and derivatives,  xxxg1805xxx  binds the hypolipidemic fibrates.  xxxg1805xxx  activation mediates changes in lipoprotein metabolism. moreover,  xxxg1805xxx  activators increase hepatic uptake and esterification of free  xxxd2154xxx , in addition to increasing mitochondrial free fatty acid uptake and the resulting free fatty acid oxidation. the effect of fibrates on the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is due to a  xxxg1805xxx -dependent stimulation of  xxxg1337xxx  and of apolipoprotein (apo)a-v and to an inhibition of apoc-iii expression, whereas the increase in plasma hdl-cholesterol depends partly on an overexpression of  xxxg1335xxx -i and  xxxg1335xxx -ii. ppars are also expressed in atherosclerotic lesions.
