effects of single and long-term theophylline treatment on the threshold of mechanical nociception: contribution of adenosine a1 and  xxxg831xxx -adrenoce...  the effects of single and long-term treatment with theophylline as well as the influence of  xxxg81xxx  agonist cyclopentyladenosine (cpa) and a-adrenergic receptor antagonists  xxxd3000xxx  and yohimbine were assessed in the paw pressure test in rats. both single (37.5 and 75 mg/kg) and long-term (75 mg/kg/day, 14 days i.p.) theophylline treatments exerted antinociceptive effect by increasing the mechanical pain threshold. single treatment of theophylline (75 mg/kg) antagonized the antinociceptive effect of cpa (0.1 mg/kg); cpa (0.1 mg/kg) abolished the theophylline-induced antinociception. chronic treatment with theophylline did not change the antinociceptive effect of cpa, while cpa decreased the theophylline antinociception. yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg), an a 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, diminished the antinociception of a single dose (75 mg/kg) of theophylline, whereas  xxxd3000xxx , an a 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect it. these results suggest that adenosine a1 and a 2-adrenoceptors take part in the antinociception induced by a single dose of theophylline. the antinociception induced by chronic theophylline treatment probably has a more complex mechanism in which the involvement of adenosine a1.
