abstract. staphylococcus aureus, which mediated binding to heparan sulfate, and also strains of
coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) adhered in high numbers to polymers with end-point
attached heparin. a characteristic feature of several cell growth factors is strong affinity for
heparin. in the present study, binding of the 125i-labeled heparin-binding growth factors (hbgf),
acidic and  xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx ), and platelet-derived growth factor
(pdgf) by s. aureus and cns strains was examined. staphylococcal strains used in this study bind
 xxxg787xxx  and pdgf, but not  xxxg786xxx . the binding of  xxxg787xxx  and pdgf was time dependent, influenced
by ph and ionic strength for s. aureus cowan 1. preincubation of staphylococcal cells with
unlabeled  xxxg787xxx  enhanced  xxxg787xxx  binding, but heparin, protamine sulfate, poly-l-lysine, and
 xxxd3266xxx  were potent inhibitors of 125i- xxxg787xxx  binding to cells of s. aureus cowan 1. glycosaminoglycans of comparable size ( xxxd1687xxx ), other polysulfated polymers (l-carrageenan, fucoidan), and some polysulfated polysaccharides ( xxxd1860xxx ,  xxxd2878xxx ) inhibited
binding of both gfs to various extents. the partial inhibition of binding of both gfs after protease
and periodate treatments indicates that both proteinaceous and other carbohydrate moieties participate in the binding. a lysozyme cell surface extract and bacterial lysates of s. aureus cowan 1
competitively inhibited binding of 125i- xxxg787xxx  and 125i-pdgf. these results suggest that staphylococci have the ability to bind two of the hbgfs,  xxxg787xxx  and pdgf, but not  xxxg786xxx , via more than
one cell structure. these binding structures seem to be exposed on the cell surface and deeply
anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane as well.

staphylococcus aureus is a primary human pathogen
causing wound infections, endocarditis, arthritis, and
osteomyelitis [29]. binding of a number of extracellular matrix proteins (ecm) such as fibronectin (fn),
laminin (ln), and collagens (cn) and fibrinogen (fg)
to s. aureus and other pathogenic staphylococcal
species is an initial event of these infections [28].
ecm proteins become exposed when the tissue
integrity is disturbed in various tissue traumas, but
infections of apparently normal endovascular tissues
also occur [29]. expression of binding of fn and ln
has been proposed to be a mechanism of tissue
adhesion [21]. binding of cn has been proposed to
target staphylococcal strains to collagen-rich tissues,
like joints [26], and expression of binding of bone
sialoprotein ii by s. aureus and cns to bone tissue in
patients with osteomyelitis [24]. there is considerable
correspondence to: c. pascu

interstrain variation of binding of these tissue proteins by s. aureus and cns. strains of s. aureus and
cns species also bind radiolabeled soluble and
immobilized heparan sulfate (hs) and heparin [15,
22]. since ecm proteins such as fn, cn, ln, and
thrombospondin (tsp) possess heparin- xxxg1070xxx  sequences [17], binding of heparin, hs, and
ecm proteins may interfere with subsequent binding
of gfs in infected tissues.
hbgf, such as  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , and pdgf, are
important for the proliferation, migration, and maturation of epithelial cells during wound healing [25].
hs binds  xxxg787xxx  [11, 12] and constitutes a tissue
reservoir for this gf [3]. upon binding to hs (or
other heparin-like molecules),  xxxg787xxx  was shown to be
protected from proteolytic degradation and to exert
mitogenic effects [10]. pdgf is stored in the alpha
granules of platelets, is released during blood clotting
or when platelets adhere at sites of blood vessel injury

202

[8], and promotes wound healing. pdgf is the most
potent mitogen in serum for cells of mesenchymal
origin and acts as a mediator of inflammation [8].
the aim of this study was to explore if staphylococci bind the three hbgf,  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , and pdgf, as
recently shown for the gastric pathogen helicobacter
pylori [2], since direct microbial binding of hbgf
may interfere with tissue repair during various stages
of infection.
materials and methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions. s. aureus strains wood
46, cowan 1, v8 and isp 546, and s. epidermidis strain rp 12, as
well as strains of different cns species, isolated from patients with
osteomyelitis and biomaterial-associated infections, micrococcus
sp isolated from blood cultures, and two escherichia coli strains
isolated from rectal biopsies of patients with ulcerative colitis were
studied. the strains were cultured on blood agar (lab m, salford,
uk) with horse erythrocytes (5% vol/vol) at 37°c for 18–24 h.
cells were washed twice in 0.07 m phosphate buffer saline (pbs),
ph 7.2, and resuspended in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (naac), ph
4.0, with 0.1% bsa.
tunicamycin treatment of staphylococci. s. epidermidis rp 12
cells were grown at 37°c, for 24 h, with continuous shaking in
todd-hewitt broth with tunicamycin (0, 3.1, 6.3, and 12.5 µg/ml)
[23]. the cells were washed, suspended in 0.1 m naac buffer, and
tested in the binding assay as described below.
cell surface extracts and preparation of lysates. washed cells of
strain s. aureus cowan 1 and s. epidermidis rp 12 grown on blood
agar were incubated with 0.6 ml 10 mm tris-hcl ph 7.4 buffer
containing 30% [wt/vol] raffinose, 1 mg/ml of  xxxd302xxx , 0.5
mg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 µg dnase, 100 µg
rnase, and 100 µg lysozyme, and incubated for 60 min at 37°c as
described previously [6].
lysates were prepared from 0.2 g wet weight bacteria. washed
cells were resuspended in 1 ml pbs and mixed 3:1 with reducing
buffer (1.6 ml 10% sds, 0.8 ml glycerol, 0.4 ml aq. dest., 1.0 ml 0.5
m tris-hcl, ph 6.8, and 0.1 m dithiothreitol). after being boiled for
5 min, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 30,000 rpm.
samples were stored at 220°c until use.
125i-labeled

gfs binding assay. washed cells (5 3 108 cfu/ml)
were incubated with 50 µl 125i-gf in 0.2 m hepes buffer with 0.15 m
nacl and 0.15% gelatin (for  xxxg787xxx ) at ph 7.4, and 0.01 m citrate,
0.1 m sodium phosphate, and 1% bsa at ph 4.6 (for pdgf) for 1 h
at 20°c. the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold pbs with
0.1% tween 20. after centrifugation at 1760 g for 15 min, the
radioactivity associated with the pellet was measured in a 1260multigamma (lkb-wallac, turku finland), as earlier described
[17]. tests were performed in duplicate, and data are expressed as
mean values of bound gfs in relation to total amount of added gfs.
the cut-off value was set  xxxd2274xxx % [1].
influence of heat and enzyme treatment. after being washed,
cells were heated at 90°c for 30 min, rapidly cooled, and then tested
for binding abilities. bacterial cells were also incubated with
different enzymes at 37°c for 1 h. the cells were carefully washed
twice with 1 ml pbs to remove enzyme residues, resuspended in
0.1 m naac 1 0.1% bsa buffer at the original concentration, and
tested in the standard binding assay. the incubation condition for
each enzyme was according to the worthington enzyme manual

current microbiology vol. 32 (1996)

(worthington biochemical corp., freehold, n.j.), with a ratio of
enzyme to substrate of 100 µg to 100 µl.
influence of periodate treatment. bacterial cell suspensions in 0.1
m naac buffer were incubated overnight with 100 mm sodium
periodate, at 4°c in the dark. after three washings with pbs, the
cells were further incubated with 100 mm nabh4 for 1 h, washed
twice in pbs, and resuspended in 0.1 m naac at a concentration of
5 3 108 cfu/ml.
125i-gfs

binding inhibition assays. bacterial cell suspensions
(100 µl) were incubated with 100 µl of a test substance at a final
concentration of 1 mg/ml for polysulfated agents and of 0.1% for
sugars, for 1 h at 20°c. fifty µl of radiolabeled gfs was added, and
the binding assay was then performed as described above.
the ability of cell extracts to inhibit gf binding was tested by
incubating cell extracts (100 µl) with 50 µl of labeled gfs at room
temperature for 1 h before 100 µl of a bacterial cell suspension was
added.
competitive inhibition was studied by adding increasing
amounts of unlabeled  xxxg787xxx , heparin, protamine sulfate, or  xxxd3266xxx 
at the same time as the labeled  xxxg787xxx  was added to the staphylococcal cell suspensions. binding was as described above.

the effect of ph and salt concentration on gfs binding. buffers
with different phs—0.2 m glycine-hcl (ph 2.0), 0.1 m naac (ph
4.0, 5.5), pbs (ph 6.8, 7.2), 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 7.5), and 0.1 m
edta (ph 8.0)—were used as incubation buffers in gf binding
tests. in one set of experiments, bacterial cell suspensions were
washed with 2 m nacl, before binding was tested.
protein determinations. protein concentration of extracts was
determined by the biorad protein assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

s. epidermidis rp 12, and totally abolished pdgf
binding.
inhibition of gf binding by unlabeled  xxxg787xxx  and
cell surface extracts. when bacterial cell suspensions
of s. aureus cowan 1 were incubated with unlabeled
 xxxg787xxx  (in a 100- to 1000-fold excess), binding of  xxxg787xxx 
was enhanced (data not shown). after preincubation of
these gfs with a lysozyme cell extract (40 µg/ml final
concentration) or a bacterial cell lysate (prepared from
the same strain), subsequent binding of either gf was
completely inhibited (data not shown). control experiments were done in parallel only with lysozyme
solution (1 mg/ml final concentration), with no inhibitory or competitive effect on gf binding.
inhibition of gf binding by other potential inhibitors. to assess the specificity of the  xxxg787xxx  and pdgf
binding properties to s. aureus, we analyzed a panel of
compounds (protamine sulfate, polypeptides, gags,
other hbgf, heparin-like molecules, and sugars) for
their ability to reduce the binding gf by s. aureus.
protamine sulfate and polypeptides (100 µg) completely inhibited binding of both gfs to staphylococcal cells. heparin (already at the lowest concentration
at 0.6 µg/ml; mw 6000–4000) and fragmint (at 125
iu/ml final concentration; mw 5000) inhibited about
90% on 125i- xxxg787xxx  binding to cells of s. aureus cowan
1 and s. epidermidis rp 12, but the inhibition of pdgf
binding was only about 50%. heparin-like molecules,
at 1 mg/ml final concentration, such as fucoidan,
 xxxd1860xxx , pentosan sulfate, and l-carrageenan,
reduced binding of  xxxg787xxx  by 75–60%, and chondroitin
sulfate to a lesser extent (45%). pdgf binding was
inhibited by fucoidan (70%) and by about 50% by
other heparin-like molecules. unsulfated polysaccharides and colominic acid had no effect on binding of
either gfs.  xxxd3266xxx  (1 mg/ml final concentration)
inhibited binding of  xxxg787xxx  and pdgf to s. aureus

cowan 1 by 60% and 50% respectively. transferrin (at
1 mg/ml final concentration), an iron-dependent glycoprotein which binds heparin, in our experiments inhibited the binding of  xxxg787xxx  by 50% and pdgf binding
by 35%. other hbgf, such as efg, inhibited binding
of  xxxg787xxx  to a lesser extent ( xxxd1891xxx  µg/ml final concentration) by 35%, and pdgf binding by 25%.
competitive inhibition of 125i- xxxg787xxx  binding. the
competitive inhibitory effect of protamine sulfate,
heparin, and  xxxd3266xxx  was tested on  xxxg787xxx  binding to s.
aureus cowan 1 (fig. 3). the following concentrations
were required for 50% decrease in binding: heparin 0.3
µg/ml, protamine sulfate 10 µg/ml, and  xxxd3266xxx  100
µg/ml.
influence of heat, enzyme, and periodate treatment.
pronase e, protease k, and heat treatment of staphylococcal cells reduced binding of pdgf by about 50%
(table 1). binding of  xxxg787xxx  was inhibited by pronase e
and trypsin, but not by protease k and heat treatment.
periodate treatment decreased pdgf binding by 40%
and  xxxg787xxx  binding by 55%.
tunicamycin. when staphylococci were grown in
todd-hewitt broth with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of
n-linked oligosaccharide synthesis [23], binding of
 xxxg787xxx  to s. epidermidis rp12 was reduced by 53%
(table 2). sugars like mannose, a-methyl-mannoside,
mannoseamine,  xxxd2683xxx , or n-acetylgalactosamine (at 1% final concentration) did not
affect the binding of either gf (data not shown).

discussion
hbgf receptors have been extensively studied in
many cell lines [5, 25]. herpes simplex type 1 (hsv-1)
utilizes high-affinity receptors for  xxxg787xxx  as a portal of
cellular entry [13]. the concept that hsv-1 uses the
 xxxg787xxx  receptor is based on findings that hsv-1 binds

to hs on plasma cell membranes, as an initial step in
the adsorption process [18]. such high-affinity fgf
receptors are usually glycoproteins, and it is accepted
that hs glycosaminoglycan and other proteoglycans
are low-affinity binding sites for fgfs [19]. blumberg
et al. [4] reported already in 1988 that an hbgf,  xxxg786xxx ,
decreased adherence of s. aureus to endothelial cells
and showed that hs was directly involved in this
process, data not contradicting our results. despite this
early discovery, it is remarkable that binding of
heparin and other polysulfated carbohydrates as well
as hbgf to staphylococci was not studied until much
later [15]. the findings that a specific heparin-binding
peptide sequence of  xxxg2422xxx  interacts with one

60-kda cell surface protein of s. aureus [16] encouraged us to carry out the present study. since the first
steps in a staphylococcal infection may involve interaction with ecm components, including hs, we attempted to distinguish whether  xxxg787xxx  (or pdgf) was
competing with s. aureus for binding to the same, most
common polysaccharide component of plasma membrane proteoglycans, hs.
binding of  xxxg786xxx  was not expressed by the staphylococcal strains studied, whereas binding of pdgf and
 xxxg787xxx  was common. it is interesting that staphylococci
expressed different abilities to bind these two fibroblast growth factors which share more than 50%
homology between the two polypeptides [5]. the
binding of 125i- xxxg787xxx  and 125i-pdgf was strong at
acidic ph and was inhibited by 50% in the case of
 xxxg787xxx  and totally abolished in the case of pdgf when
2 m nacl was added, indicating that ionic interactions
are involved. the low-affinity  xxxg787xxx  binding was
reported to be abolished by washing the cells with 2 m
nacl [5]. additionally, polybasic amino acid polymers
such as poly-l-lysine were potent inhibitors on  xxxg787xxx 
and pdgf binding to staphylococcal strains, suggesting that the clustering of basic amino acid residues in a
certain configuration may be required to obtain inhibitory effects of basic proteins or polypeptides on both
gf binding. recently, elucidation of the threedimensional structure of  xxxg787xxx  has indicated the
presence of a cluster of basic residues (several basic
arg and lys) on the surface of the molecule [9]. this
basic cluster, involved in the interaction with a sulfate
ion, may match anionic sequences in the heparin chain,
resulting in multiple ionic interactions. protamine
sulfate has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of
125i-pdgf receptor-binding activity and mitogenic
activity [5]. protamine sulfate (100 µg) effectively
inhibited binding of 125i- xxxg787xxx  and 125i-pdgf. pdgf
and protamine share similar chemical and physical
properties. both proteins are rich in basic amino acid
residues and have high isoelectric points (pi); (pdgf,
pi 5 10.2; protamine, pi 5 12.0). both proteins compete for the pdgf cell receptors [5, 20]. it is interesting that protamine is also an effective inhibitor of
angiogenesis, in which proliferation of endothelial
cells is a key event [27].
 xxxd3266xxx  (polysulfonated naphthylurea), a polyanionic compound, has been shown to dissociate pdgf
from its cell receptor [5, 7, 14]. in our experiments,
 xxxd3266xxx  had a moderate inhibitory effect, in which the
polysulfated content may play an important role.
when staphylococcal cells were preincubated
with heparin,  xxxg787xxx  and pdgf binding was inhibited
by 95% and 60%, respectively. the same inhibition

206

was obtained when heparin was preincubated with
125i- xxxg787xxx  before bacterial cells were added. from
these results we conclude that binding of  xxxg787xxx  and
pdgf to s. aureus and to s. epidermidis seems to
interfere with the heparin-binding domains of these
hbgf. additionally, pronase e, proteinase k, and
heat treatment reduced pdgf binding by 54%, while
binding of  xxxg787xxx  was decreased by pronase e and
trypsin, but not by proteinase k and heat treatment.
this is also supported by the partial inhibition of
binding by transferrin, which also has a heparin-binding domain. in conclusion, our results show that
binding of pdgf and  xxxg787xxx  differed in several
aspects and appears to be mediated by different
protein structures. complete inhibition by a lysozyme
cell surface extract and bacterial lysates indicated
that the structures responsible for binding of  xxxg787xxx 
and pdgf seem to be exposed on the cell surface and
probably deeply anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane.
the hbgfs are stored through their interaction
with matrix-associated hs and can be released and
stimulate cell migration, multiplication, and differentiation during tissue repair. the hbgfs are active upon
release from neighboring inflammatory or circulating
cells, as well as upon release from hs proteoglycosaminoglycans that are associated with the ecm. in
wounds and biomaterial-associated infections, staphylococci possibly can interact with extracellular released  xxxg787xxx  and pdgf, which facilitates attachment
of these microbes to heparin-like, cell-associated glycosaminoglycans, since these gfs are strong heparinbinding proteins. such interactions may also reduce
the bioavailability of these hbgfs in the infected
tissue and delay a cascade of cellular repair events
necessary for normal wound healing. however, our
data presented here suggest that heparin-binding properties of two hbgfs play a role in bacterial recognition.
