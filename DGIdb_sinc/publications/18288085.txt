human abuse liability of the smoking cessation
drug varenicline in smokers and nonsmokers
sl mccoll1, ah burstein2, kr reeves2, cb billing jr3, m stolar3 and em sellers1,4–6
varenicline is an alpha4beta2  xxxg456xxx  partial agonist developed as an aid for smoking cessation.
this study evaluated varenicline’s potential for abuse by smokers (n = 23) and nonsmokers (n = 22). the study used
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy crossover design with five treatment periods: 15 and
30 mg amphetamine, 1 and 3 mg varenicline, and placebo. following each treatment, the participants were assessed
on aspects relating to potential abuse of the drug (e.g., drug liking, drug high, and drug monetary value).
the positive effects measured for 3 mg varenicline were similar to those for the placebo, and significantly lower than
those for amphetamine in both smokers and nonsmokers. unpleasant effects were reported for 3 mg varenicline
in both participant groups. for 1 mg varenicline, the overall patterns were similar, with the exception that the
nonsmokers group showed some small positive effects balanced by some negative effects when compared with
the effects of placebo. these findings lead to the conclusion that varenicline is unlikely to be abused.
nicotine has potent reinforcing effects in animals,1–3 and the
nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive.4,5 in human abuse liability studies, both smoked and intravenous formulations indicate abuse liability.6–8 however, smoking cessation treatments
such as nicotine replacement therapies (nrts; e.g., transdermal
patch, nasal spray, gum, lozenges, and inhaler) have slower nicotine absorption rates than cigarettes and have been shown to be
associated with a much lower potential for abuse.9–11
varenicline is an alpha4beta2  xxxg456xxx  partial agonist that has been shown to achieve higher continuous
abstinence rates in smokers trying to quit, than the use of either
placebo or sustained-release bupropion.12–17 it binds with high
affinity to the alpha4beta2  xxxg456xxx  subtype and
activates the mesocorticolimbic reward system in a manner
similar to nicotine. its partial agonist property is thought to help
reduce craving and alleviate withdrawal symptoms by partially
activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the absence of
nicotine, while its antagonist properties block the effects of nicotine received from smoking.18,19 the partial agonist property
of varenicline would also be expected to reduce its potential for
abuse as compared to nicotine, and this has been demonstrated
in studies comparing other partial agonists with their full agonist
counterparts.20–22 partial agonists have a low potential for abuse
because they do not attain maximal agonist response and result in

a weaker dose–response relationship. additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile of varenicline (when delivered orally, the mean
time taken to attain maximum observed plasma concentration
(tmax) is >2  xxxd1322xxx ) would also suggest low potential for abuse. this
is because, for drugs with similar pharmacologic properties, slowonset drugs with long-duration effects (long tmax and long t1/2) are
associated with a lower potential for abuse than are rapid-onset
drugs with short-duration effects (short tmax and short terminal
elimination half-life (t1/2)).24–27 consistent with this pharmacokinetic profile, the varenicline-induced increase in dopamine
in rat nucleus accumbens has a slower onset and is longer lasting when compared against the rapid increase and fast decline in
dopamine release that characterize nicotine and other drugs of
abuse. however, because varenicline does increase mesolimbic
dopamine release and acts as a reinforcer in animals trained to
self-administer nicotine,19 further testing was required to assess
its human abuse potential.
the purpose of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the potential for abuse of varenicline by humans. the effects of varenicline
on human measures of abuse liability were compared with the
effects of a placebo control or with amphetamine, a drug with
an established pattern of abuse that was chosen as the positive
control based on precedent abuse liability literature for psychomotor stimulants28 and smoking cessation aids including

results
validity of study

in the case of amphetamine, the effects were statistically significant for both 15 and 30 mg as compared to the effects with
placebo (p < 0.01). table 1 summarizes the mean values and
95% confidence intervals of the peak ratings for each treatment
separately for smokers and nonsmokers. table 2 provides results
of the respective 4 degrees of freedom likelihood ratio tests for
the multivariate comparisons of 15 or 30 mg amphetamine vs.
placebo for smokers and nonsmokers. the specific variableby-treatment contrasts (table 2) show that all four individual
primary outcome measures were significantly elevated for both
amphetamine doses relative to placebo.
an examination of these contrasts, as well as the least-squares
mean values in table 1, strongly support the validity of the study,
in that the effects of both dose levels of amphetamine differed
from those of placebo, with the anticipated mean dose–response
relationship being observed for each of the four primary outcome measures in smokers and nonsmokers.

primary outcome measures. figure 1 shows the mean values of

the peak ratings and 95% confidence intervals for visual ­analog
scale (vas) drug liking and mean ln(mcp) (multiple choice
subjective price monetary value procedure) scores following
each treatment for smokers and nonsmokers. after the administration of 3 mg varenicline, the mean peak scores for vas drug
liking and the mean ln(mcp) score were similar to those of
placebo and lower than those for 15 and 30 mg amphetamine,
in both smokers and nonsmokers (figure 1). likewise, after
administration of 1 mg varenicline, these parameters were similar
to those of placebo and lower than those following administration of 15 and 30 mg amphetamine, in both smoking status
groups (figure 1). unlike the case of amphetamine, for which
the scores on both of these variables increase with increasing dose,
the scores on both variables are lower for 3 mg varenicline than for
1 mg varenicline, in both smokers and nonsmokers, thereby indicating a negative dose response. mean peak scores for vas drug
high and addiction research center inventory (arci) abuse
potential following 1 and 3 mg varenicline were similar to the patterns observed in figure 1 for the vas drug liking and ln(mcp)
scores (see table 1). smokers rated 1 and 3 mg varenicline similar
to the placebo, and lower than for 15 and 30 mg amphetamine.
nonsmokers rated varenicline 1 and 3 mg higher on the vas
drug high scale than placebo at 1–2 h postdose. varenicline
also had a slight negative dose response on vas drug high and
arci abuse potential scales in both smoking status groups, while
amphetamine had a positive dose response on both scales.
multivariate treatment contrasts. the results of the respective
4 degrees of freedom likelihood ratio tests for the multivariate comparisons of the primary outcome measures for smokers
and nonsmokers are given in table 2.
in the multivariate comparison, the smokers’ 3 mg varenicline
scores significantly differed from their placebo scores (p = 0.03;
table 2). a similar statistical analysis for nonsmokers was also
significant (p = 0.01; table 2). consequently, the four-dimensional
experience of 3 mg varenicline differs from that of placebo, for both
smokers and nonsmokers. individual variable-by-treatment contrasts showed that smokers rated placebo significantly higher than
3 mg varenicline on the vas drug liking scale (p = 0.04; table 2),
but that the other variables did not significantly differ with treatment in this group. for nonsmokers, none of the contrasts for the
primary outcome measures for 3 mg varenicline were statistically
significant when compared with placebo (table 2). there was a statistically significant difference between 3 mg varenicline and 30 mg
amphetamine (p < 0.01) in the 4 degrees of freedom multivariate
test for both smokers and nonsmokers (table 2).
an examination of the specific variable-by-treatment contrasts show that each of the four individual primary outcome
measures was significantly greater for 30 mg amphetamine than
for 3 mg varenicline in both the participant groups (p < 0.01;
table 2). post-hoc comparisons of 3 mg varenicline to 15 mg
amphetamine indicated that 15 mg amphetamine also resulted
in significantly higher results than 3 mg varenicline for each of
the four individual primary outcome measures in smokers as

well as in nonsmokers (table 2). comparisons of least-squares
mean values after administering 1 and 3 mg varenicline (table 1)
show that 3 mg varenicline yielded lower estimated mean scores
on all four primary outcome measures than 1 mg varenicline did
in both subject groups.
smokers did not significantly differentiate 1 mg varenicline from
placebo (p = 0.38; table 2), but nonsmokers did (p < 0.01; table 2).
an examination of the specific variable-by-treatment contrasts in
table 2 shows no statistically significant differences between 1 mg
varenicline and placebo on any of the four primary outcome measures. table 2 shows that, for nonsmokers, the differences in vas
drug liking and ln(mcp) for 1 mg varenicline vs. placebo were not
statistically significant, but that the differences in vas drug high
(p < 0.05) and arci/cole abuse potential (p < 0.01) were significant. in the multivariate analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between 1 mg varenicline and 30 mg amphetamine,
for smokers (p < 0.01; table 2) as well as nonsmokers (p < 0.01;
table 2). the specific variable-by-treatment contrasts in table 2
show that each of the four individual primary outcome measures
was significantly greater for 30 mg amphetamine than for 1 mg
varenicline in smokers and nonsmokers alike. post-hoc comparisons of 15 mg amphetamine and 1 mg varenicline indicated
that 15 mg amphetamine was also significantly greater than 1 mg
varenicline for each of the four individual outcome measures for
smokers as well as nonsmokers, with the exception of arci/cole
abuse potential in the nonsmokers group (table 2).

timecourse. figure 2 shows the mean timecourse scores for vas
drug liking for smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. the
3 mg varenicline vas drug liking scores tended toward “dislike” through 8 h after the dose was administered in smokers
(figure 2). for nonsmokers, the 3 mg varenicline vas drug
liking scores were also in the range of “dislike” through 24 h
postdose. the 1 mg varenicline vas drug liking scores across
timecourse for smokers and nonsmokers were consistently
close to those of placebo over time (figure 2).
the mean timecourse scores for both doses of amphetamine
were noticeably elevated relative to varenicline and placebo
across most timepoints on all measures of positive subjective
effects. timecourse scores for the other measures of primary
outcomes (ln(mcp), vas drug high and arci abuse potential)
showed similar profiles with the pattern for 1 and 3 mg varenicline over time being more akin to that for placebo and less akin
to the patterns of both doses of amphetamine.

outcomes of other measures of positive effects. in both smokers and
nonsmokers, there was a negative dose response for varenicline on the vas energized and vas pleasant physical state,
and no dose response on the arci/cole stimulation-motor
scale. in contrast, amphetamine showed a dose-dependent
positive response on all three scales, as compared with placebo.
nonsmoking participants seemed to experience some positive
subjective effects with 1 mg varenicline, which were higher than

articles
those for placebo, but less than those for 15 mg amphetamine. for
example, they showed elevated scores on vas energized; arci/
cole stimulation–motor; arci/cole amphetamine; arci
stimulation–euphoria; and arci stimulation–motor for some,
if not all, points across the timecourse. the 1 mg varenicline
scores for smokers were close to those of placebo for most of the
positive subjective effects, but were slightly elevated in comparison to placebo on the vas energized across the timecourse.

figure 3 shows the mean peak ratings and 95% confidence intervals for vas bad effects and vas nausea following each treatment for smokers and nonsmokers. after the administration of
3 mg varenicline, the mean peak scores for vas bad effects and
vas nausea were both higher than in all the other treatments,
including placebo (figure 3). after 1 mg varenicline, the smokers group had scores similar to placebo scores on both these
scales (figure 3); whereas nonsmokers scored higher than
smokers

placebo on these negative effect measurements. this indicates
that nonsmokers may be more sensitive to these negative effects
of varenicline than smokers (figure 3). figure 4 shows the
mean timecourse data for vas nausea, after each of the treatments, for smokers and nonsmokers. nausea ratings peaked
at 1–2 h postdose for 1 and 3 mg varenicline in the nonsmoker
group and for 3 mg varenicline in the smoker group.
there was also a positive dose response (negative effects
increasing with increased dose) on other measures of negative effects (vas fatigue; vas unpleasantness–dysphoria; vas
unpleasantness–physical; and arci  xxxd2527xxx

groups.

discussion

this study evaluated the potential for abuse of varenicline by
smokers and nonsmokers. the validity of the study was confirmed for smoker and nonsmoker cohorts: amphetamine produced the expected pharmacologic effects and dose–response
profile of a drug of abuse. participants’ ratings on primary abuse
liability measures were positive and increased with each dose
of amphetamine; ratings were significantly greater in response
to both doses of amphetamine than in response to placebo. in
contrast, varenicline’s pharmacologic effects and dose–response
profile were unlike that of a drug of abuse. after administration
of 1 and 3 mg varenicline, the mean peak responses of the participants were similar to those seen after administration of placebo and significantly less than for 15 and 30 mg amphetamine.
the dose–response relationships for 1 and 3 mg varenicline were
either flat or in the negative direction, indicating lower ratings
of positive drug effects with higher dose. the timecourse analyses also demonstrated that varenicline was rated as similar to
placebo and unlike that of amphetamine on measures of abuse
liability in both smokers and nonsmokers.
varenicline was also associated with negative effects in smokers
and nonsmokers. negative effects were often rated as greater for
varenicline in comparison with placebo and also in comparison
with each of the doses of amphetamine. this was particularly
evident in the 3 mg varenicline mean timecourse scores of arci/
cole unpleasantness–physical, vas fatigue, and vas nausea.
there were few differences in the outcomes associated with
varenicline in smokers compared with nonsmokers. the fact
that the nonsmokers registered a significant difference between
the scores for 1 mg varenicline and those for placebo in the multivariate analysis, whereas such a difference was absent in the
smokers group, along with the findings of some higher scores
across timecourse in the nonsmokers group in comparison to
the smokers group, may indicate that nonsmokers were more
sensitive to the effects of varenicline. however, any elevated
positive effect outcomes for varenicline in nonsmokers tended
clinical pharmacology & therapeutics | volume 83 number 4 | april 2008

to be offset by simultaneous negative effects. for example, the
mean peak score for vas drug high at 1–2 h postdose in this
group coincided with the mean peak score for vas nausea and
was, therefore, not likely to be a positive experience.
the findings in this study are not unlike those reported on
the abuse liability of nrts. these latter have formulations with
slower absorption of nicotine, such as the transdermal patch,
nasal spray, gum, inhaler, and lozenges which, in laboratory
studies of smokers, present a much lower potential for abuse
than nicotine from cigarettes.9–11 low ratings of potential for
abuse, such as drug liking, good effects, and drug high, have
been reported for nrts,9–11 but the magnitude of the ratings
for varenicline observed in the present study were even lower.
given that the predictive validity of these measures in nrts
has been established in the real world with low actual rates of
abuse,10 it is also unlikely that varenicline would be abused in
the real world. consistent with this statement, there have been
no postmarketing signals of potential for abuse after varenicline was approved for use in the united states (may 2006), the
european union (september 2006), and canada (january 2007)
(data on file, pfizer).
the pattern of results for both smokers and nonsmokers in
this study is consistent with pharmacologic effects and a dose–
response profile, unlike the pattern seen with drugs of abuse.
the multivariate analyses of primary measures of abuse potential
were consistent with the univariate analyses of the individual
outcome measures and further evaluation of additional pharmacologic effects. the dose–response profiles on both the positive
and negative scales for varenicline were notably different from
those for amphetamine. the similarity of participant ratings of
varenicline as compared to placebo, and varenicline’s unpleasant
effects, limit the potential for its abuse.
methods
participants
participants were healthy men and women (smokers n = 23;
nonsmokers n = 22). there were 16 men and 7 women in the smokers
group and 20 men and 2 women in the nonsmokers group. the mean
bmi (kg/m2) values were similar between groups, with a mean bmi
of 23.8 (range 20.1–31.2) in the smokers and 24.0 (range 19.9–30.2)
in the nonsmokers. in terms of race, there were 17 white and 4 black
participants, 1 asian participant, and 1 participant of “other race” in
the smokers group. nonsmokers consisted of 11 white, 2 black, 2 asian
participants, and 7 participants of “other races.” as regards consumption
of alcohol, 12 participants in the smokers group and 11 participants in
the nonsmokers group consumed 1–6 units of alcohol per week, while
7 smokers and 4 nonsmokers consumed between 7 and 12 units per
week. the history of drug use among the study participants is given
in table 4. participants in the smokers group smoked an average of at
least 10 cigarettes per day with no period of continuous abstinence >3
months in the past year. of the 23 smokers, 18 had smoked an average
of 10–20 cigarettes per day over the previous year, and 5 had smoked an
average of >20 cigarettes per day. on the fagerström test of nicotine
dependence,32 each indicated that they smoked the first cigarette of
the day within 30 min of waking. current smoking status was also
confirmed by urine cotinine measurements. participants were excluded
from the study if they were pregnant or nursing, or tested positive for
the hepatitis b or the hepatitis c virus antigen. those with evidence or
history of any clinically significant medical or psychiatric disorder were
also excluded, on the basis of medical history, physical examination, and

aas participants were polydrug users, some drugs may have been taken
simultaneously. in addition to the drugs listed here, three subjects reported using
other drugs on occasion (e.g., ketamine, percocet) .

laboratory tests. participants who had received treatment with any other
investigational drug within 30 days preceding the first dose of study
medication, or those with a history of alcohol consumption exceeding
7 drinks per week (women) or 14 drinks per week (men) within 6 months
prior to screening, were also excluded. the use of prescription drugs
(other than contraceptives) and nonprescription drugs (except ≤2 g
acetaminophen), vitamins, and dietary supplements were not permitted
within 7 days prior to receiving the first study dose.
the study received approval from an ethics committee (institutional
review board services, aurora, ontario, canada). each participant provided written informed consent prior to the commencement of the trial.
participants were paid for their participation.

qualification procedure
ninety-one eligible participants underwent a single-blind
amphetamine qualification procedure prior to entry into the study.
this was to confirm that they could reliably distinguish a test dose
of amphetamine from a placebo (see refs. 33–35 for discussion on
prestudy enrichment procedures). the qualification period involved
administration of four doses of “study” drug (three doses of placebo
and one dose of 15 mg of d-amphetamine) at 90-min intervals.
d-amphetamine was always the second dose administered in the series.
participants completed assessments for potential for abuse at baseline
and 1 h after each dose. participants were appropriately trained and
given practice on all tests prior to baseline assessments. in order to
qualify for inclusion, participants had to show a positive correlation
of at least 0.7 between the response profile and the expected profile
on the mcp and at least one of the vas drug liking, drug high or
the arci/cole abuse potential scale (see methods section below).
they also had to show a 25-unit increase in vas drug high between
15 mg amphetamine and placebo.
study design and experimental conditions
the study was a randomized, double-blind, five-period, placebocontrolled, double-dummy, crossover design and was conducted
in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and the interna­
tional conference on harmonization of good clinical practices
guidelines.
treatments were administered to each participant in 1 of 10 possible
randomly assigned treatment sequences: 15 mg amphetamine; 30 mg
amphetamine; 1 mg varenicline; 3 mg varenicline; placebo. amphetamine was administered in multiples of 10 mg capsules; varenicline as
0.5 mg tablets. a total of four capsules and six tablets were administered
in each session.
612

drug supply and dose selection
the amphetamine capsules, varenicline tablets, placebo tablets, and
capsules were supplied by pfizer global research and development
(groton, ct). amphetamine was sourced as united states pharmacopeia
commercial tablets from and encapsulated at mallinckrodt-tyco
(hobart, ny). the selection of the 1 mg varenicline dose was based on
the projected therapeutic dose for smoking cessation (1 mg twice daily).
the 3 mg dose of varenicline was selected to provide a supratherapeutic
dose that might be tested by a potential abuser. higher single doses
>3 mg were not considered suitable for this trial because of the expected
side effects of nausea and vomiting.
abuse liability measures
all tests were computerized and administered using scheduled
measurement system validated software.
vas. the vas35–37 (comprising drug liking, drug high, good effects,

bad effects, nausea, energized, any effects, fatigue, pleasant mental
state, pleasant physical state) were presented as 100-point horizontal
lines, each labeled with a word or phrase (e.g., “i can feel a drug effect,”
“i am feeling high,” etc.) with descriptive anchors at each end (e.g., “not
at all” and “extremely”). participants were asked to evaluate each statement based on how they felt “at that moment” and indicate their response
by moving the cursor and clicking on the mouse along the line where
appropriate.
arci (cole/arci version). a 57-item modified version of the origi-

nal martin et al.38 arci39 included eight scales: potential for abuse,
stimulation–euphoria, stimulation–motor, amphetamine, benzedrine
group, unpleasantness–dysphoria, unpleasantness–physical, lysergic
acid diethylamide.
mcp. the mcp is a measure of perceived drug cash value. participants

are asked to choose hypothetically between receiving another dose of the
drug they just took or a specified amount of money. depending on their
answer, the monetary value increases or decreases in the next question
according to a predetermined algorithm. at the end of the procedure, the
“crossover” point is determined, which is the dollar amount at which the
subject is indifferent to the choice of drug or money.

experimental procedure
the participants were admitted to the clinical research unit on the
evening prior to receiving the first dose. on the first day of each of the
five treatment periods, the study medication was administered with 240
ml of ambient temperature water after breakfast, at ~08:00 hours.
the participants stayed in the clinical research unit for ~36 h during
each treatment period. treatment sessions were separated by at least 7
days. for each treatment, the participants completed the assessments of
potential for abuse in the same order, at predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and
24 h postdose. the mcp was administered only at the time point of 8 h
postdose. serial measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory
rate, pulse oximetry, and laboratory data relating to safety were obtained,
using dinamap pro 400 monitors (ge medical systems, tampa, fl).
these safety evaluations were monitored prior to administering the dose
and at ~0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose. in addition, the participants were asked nonleading questions (e.g., “how do you feel?”) in
each treatment period on day 0, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after dosing.
investigators recorded any observed or reported adverse events.
data analyses
four outcome measures considered predictive of abuse potential were
considered primary: the maximum score over the 8 h postdose period
for (i) drug high scale of the vas and (ii) drug liking scale of the
vas, (iii) the abuse potential scale of the arci/cole, and (iv) the
dollar value at crossover from the mcp at 8 h postdose. for the mcp,
the logarithmic transform was analyzed because the choice algorithm
forms a geometric rather than an arithmetic series. all analyses were
performed separately for smokers and nonsmokers.

a sample size of 20 participants was estimated to provide at least 98%
power to detect, with a paired t-test with two-sided type i error probability of 0.05, a standardized treatment difference (treatment difference
divided by the within-subject standard deviation) of 1.0 for the analysis
of any single primary outcome measure.
the primary analyses were based on models for a multivariate outcome
consisting of the four primary outcome measures. treatment comparisons
were (i) 30 mg amphetamine vs. placebo. a significant 30 mg amphetamine treatment difference from placebo was used for establishing the
validity of the study. if the validity test succeeded, the following treatment
comparisons were made: (ii) 15 mg amphetamine vs. placebo; (iii) 1 mg
varenicline vs. placebo and 3 mg varenicline vs. placebo; (iv) 1 mg varenicline vs. 30 mg amphetamine and 3 mg varenicline vs. 30 mg amphetamine.
the four primary outcome variables were analyzed using a mixed-effects
model for a multivariate outcome consisting of the four outcome variables separately for both smokers and nonsmokers. the model contained
baseline score as a covariate as appropriate (i.e., for vas drug high and
arci/cole abuse potential only); fixed effects for sequence, period, and
treatment; and a random effect for participants (within sequence) for each
of the four outcomes. the baseline score was the predose score from each
study period. the mixed-effects model was implemented using the sas
mixed procedure, with restricted maximum likelihood estimation
algorithm, a covariance structure consisting of the kronecker product of
an unstructured covariance matrix (to account for the covariance among
outcome measures) with a compound symmetry covariance matrix (to
account for the covariance of repeated measures within participants),
and satterthwaite degrees of freedom adjustment.
each of the treatment differences for comparisons (i)–(iv) above
were tested with a 4 degrees of freedom likelihood ratio test: that is,
simultaneous testing of four primary outcomes. treatment differences
in comparisons (i) and (ii) were each tested at the alpha = 0.05 significance
level. each difference in comparison (iii) was tested  xxxd2216xxx  = 0.05, without
any multiplicity correction. differences in comparison (iv) were tested
 xxxd2216xxx  = 0.05, using a hochberg multiplicity correction. if significance on
a 4 degrees of freedom test was achieved, contrasts within the model for
each of the primary outcome variables was examined to determine how
each contributed and in which direction.
descriptive analyses were conducted for all time points and on the
maximum scores (minimum scores for negative effect scales) for the
remaining nonprimary outcome measures for smokers and nonsmokers separately for each treatment.
