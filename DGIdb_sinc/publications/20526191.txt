lidocaine, carbamazepine, and imipramine have partially overlapping binding sites and additive inhibitory effect on neuronal na+ channels.  despite the structural differences, local anesthetics, anticonvulsants, and tricyclic antidepressants exert similar use-dependent actions against voltage-gated na channels, which may be contributory to pain control. the authors explore whether these drugs could doubly occupy the channel and exert synergic clinical effect.
