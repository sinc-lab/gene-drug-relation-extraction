abstract-to
determine the factors that influence the interaction between phenoxybenzamine and
calmodulin, the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin was determined by equilibrium dialysis
under a variety of experimental conditions. this interaction was found to be similar in some respects to
the interaction between phenothiazines and calmodulin. it was saturable, with between 1 and 2 mol of
phenoxybenzamine bound to 1 mol of calmodulin. it was also dependent upon temperature, the presence
of a divalent cation such as calcium, and on ph, showing maximum binding at ph 6.5 with little binding
at ph values below 4.2 or above 8.0. the site at which phenoxybenzamine bound to calmodulin appears
to be similar to that at which certain antipsychotic agents bind, since several of them, including
penfluridol,  xxxd2956xxx  and spiroperidol, prevented the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmoduhn.
however, in contrast to the reversible binding of most phenothiazines to calmodulin, phenoxybenzamine
bound to calmodulin irreversibly. the binding of phenoxybenzamine to calmodulin was fairly selective

in that other alpha-adrenergic agents such as  xxxd3000xxx , yohimbine and clonidine failed to bind to
calmodulin when examined under the same experimental conditions. in addition, phenoxybenzamine
showed little or no calcium-dependent binding to the s-100protein, bovine  xxxg124xxx  or cytochrome
c. the irreversible complex between phenoxybenzamine and calmodulin may be useful for inhibiting
certain calmodulin-dependent reactions and for studying the various biological functions of calmodulin.

calmodulin
is a widely-distributed,
heat-stable,
acidic, calcium-binding protein that is found in high
concentrations
in the mammalian brain [l]. discovered independently by cheung [2] and kakiuchi
and yamazaki [3] as an activator of cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterase,
calmodulin has been shown to
activate many other ca 2+-dependent enzymes and
to play a role in modulating a variety of cellular
functions [4-6].
early reports on the regulation of phosphodiesterase activity showed that the calmodulininduced activation of this enzyme could be inhibited
by phenothiazine
antipsychotic drugs [7,8]. the
mechanism by which the phenothiazines inhibit the
actions of calmodulin is by directly binding to calmodulin in a ca2+-dependent manner [9, lo]. under
ordinary
conditions
this binding is reversible,
although it can be made irreversible by irradiating
chlorpromazine and calmodulin with uv light [ 111.
besides the phenothiazines,
a variety of other
agents belonging to diverse pharmacological and
chemical classes have now been shown to interact with the ca2+-calmodulin
complex, although
there are marked differences in their affinities for
calmodulin and in their potencies for inhibiting its
activity [ 121. these include antipsychotic drugs

chemically different from the phenothiazines,
tricyclic antidepressants, antianxiety agents [13], local
anesthetics, antimalarials [ 141, anthistamines, certain peptides [15], muscle relaxant agents [16], and
an opiate agonist [17]. unfortunately,
calmodulinbinding drugs, such as the phenothiazines and related
agents, can interact with a variety of biochemical
sites, making the interpretation of results obtained in
more complex biological systems difficult. a recently
described calmodulin inhibitor exhibiting greater
specificity is the compound calmidazolium.
this
agent is a potent calmodulin antagonist that displays
little affinity for several neurotransmitter
receptors with which other classes of calmodulin binding
drugs interact [18].
although some reports suggested that hydrophobic interactions were the sole requirement for
calmodulin inhibition [lo], studies on the structureactivity relationships and ph dependency of calmodulin inhibitors showed that the binding of phenothiazines and related drugs to calmodulin involves
both hydrophobic interactions between the phenothiazine
nucleus
and a non-polar
region of
calmodulin, as well as an electrostatic interaction
between the positively charged amino group on the
drug and a negatively charged residue on calmodulin
[19,20].
these structural characteristics are also shared by
drugs of other pharmacological classes, including
certain of the alpha-adrenergic
blocking agents.
indeed it has been reported [21,22] that the alphaadrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine
inhibits
the calmodulin-induced
activation
of phosphodiesterase
and that the mechanism
by which

2739

phenoxybenzamine
inhibits calmodulin activity is by
irreversible binding directly to it. in the present
study, we describe the selectivity of this binding and
the factors that influence their irreversible interaction. the results show that, like the binding of
phenothiazine
antipsychotics
to calmodulin,
the
phenoxybenzamine<almodulin
interaction was calcium dependent, ph dependent, temperature dependent, and saturable.
methods
calmodulin was purified to homogeneity from
bovine brain by the method of teo et al. [23]. the
binding of chlorpromazine
and alpha-adrenergic
agents to calmodulin was determined by equilibrium
dialysis using the technique described by levin and
weiss [9]. calmodulin was dialyzed to equilibrium
at 4” against radiolabeled chlorpromazine or alphaadrenergic agents in a buffer containing 5 mm trishcl (ph 7.0), 1 mm mgc12 and either 0.1 mm calcium or 0.3 mm egta.* the amount of drug bound
to calmodulin
was calculated as the difference
between the radioactivity found inside the dialysis
tube (which contained calmodulin) and that found
in the dialysis bath. calculations of the molar concentration of calmodulin are based on a molecular
weight of 16,200 daltons.
to determine whether or not the binding of
phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin is irreversible, calmodulin (20 pug/ml) was dialyzed to equilibrium at 4”
in a solution of 5 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.0) with 1 mm
mgclz and 0.1 mm cac12 containing either radiolabeled chlorpromazine
or radiolabeled phenoxybenzamine.
radiolabeled
chlorpromazine
was
present at a final concentration of 1 pm (1 pm cold
chlorpromazine and 0.25 ,uci for each vial); phenoxybenzamine was present at a final concentration of
0.2 pm (0.2pm
cold phenoxybenzamine
and
0.25 pci for each vial). after this first period of
dialysis, some samples were kept in buffer containing
calcium whereas others were transferred to a buffer
containing either 0.3 mm egta or unlabeled chlorpromazine or phenoxybenzamine
at 500 times the
concentration of the radiolabeled drug. the samples
were then dialyzed for 18 hr more. the amount of
radiolabeled drug that remained in the dialysis tubing
was then determined.
in the time-course study, calmodulin (20 ,ug/ml)
and [3h]phenoxybenzamine
(0.2 pm) were incubated in 5 mm  xxxd3449xxx  containing either 0.1 mm
cac12 or 0.3 mm egta. after different periods of
time, the calcium-dependent
binding was arrested
by adding 0.3 mm egta and 1oopm unlabeled
phenoxybenzamine.
the samples were dialyzed
overnight with several changes of buffer to remove
the free drugs. at the end of the dialysis procedure,
the radioactivity inside the dialysis tube was determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer.

binding of alpha-adrenergic

agents to calmodulin.

figure 1 shows the binding of chlorpromazine and
different types of alpha-adrenergic
agonists and
antagonists to calmodulin. of these compounds only
chlorpromazine
and phenoxybenzamine
exhibited
marked binding to calmodulin. this binding was
evident only in the presence of calcium ions; there
was no substantial binding in samples containing the
calcium chelating agent egta. at a concentration
of the radioligand of 1 pm, there was approximately
0.7 mol of chlorpromazine and 1.6 mol of phenoxybenzamine bound for each mole of calmodulin.
irreversible binding of phenoxybenzamine
to
calmodulin. table 1 compares the binding of chlor-

 xxxd3024xxx  and phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin
under different experimental conditions. as may be
seen, the binding of chlorpromazine to calmodulin
was calcium dependent and reversible. that is, far
more chlorpromazine bound to calmodulin in the
presence of calcium, and the drug readily dissociated
from calmodulin in the presence of egta or high
concentrations of unlabeled chlorpromazine. by contrast, although the formation of the binding of
phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin was inhibited in
the presence of egta (fig. l), once the binding
occurred, the phenoxybenzamine-calmodulin
complex could not be readily dissociated even when
dialyzed against egta or an excess of unlabeled
phenoxybenzamine
(table 1).

samples of c~modulin (20 yg/ml) were incubated at 4” and 37” in 5 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.0, with 1 mm

mgci, and 0.1 mm caci, in the presence of radiolabeled phenoxybenzamine at a concentration of
0.2 ,um(0.2 pm of nonradioactive drug + 0.25 yci for each sample). after different times of incubation,
the reaction was stopped by adding non-labeled phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mm) and egta (0.3 mm).
samples (0.5 ml for each dialysis tube) were then dialyzed overnight with several changes of buffer to
remove the free phenoxybenzamine.
each point represents the mean value of three experiments.
vertical brackets indicate the standard error.

ing of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin was calcium
dependent with essentially no binding occurring
when egta was present in the dialysis buffer. since
phenoxybenzamine
binds to calmodulin irreversibly,
it is not appropriate to determine the kinetic parameters (& and b,,,,) of the saturation isotherm.
however, from the graph it is apparent that 50% of
the maximum binding of the drug occurred at a
concentration of approximately 0.2,um and that at
saturation there was about 1.4 mol of phenoxybenzamine bound for each mole of calmodulin. this
is similar to the molar ratio of the binding of phenothiazine
antipsychotics
to calmodulin
reported
earlier 1241.
time and temperature dependency of the binding
of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin. to determine

the effect of temperature on the rate of irreversible
binding of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin, solutions of calmodu~in were incubated with radiolabeled
phenoxybenzamine
at 4” and 37”. after different
time intervals, the reaction was arrested by adding
egta
(0.3 mm)
and
non-labeled
phenoxybenzamine (100 pm), and the samples were dialyzed
overnight against buffer to remove the free phenoxybenzamine. the radioactivity found in the dialysis
tube at the end of the procedure was considered to
be the amount of drug bound at the specific time
when the reaction was stopped. figure 3 shows that
the irreversible binding of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin was considerably more rapid when incubation was carried out at 37” rather than 4”. at 37”
50% of the maximum binding occurred in less than
3 min, whereas at 4”, 50% of the maximum binding
was reached after about 1 hr.
effect of ph on the binding of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin. figure 4 shows the influence of ph

on the binding of phenoxybenzamine

to calmodulin.

the range of ph values was obtained using either
 xxxd1710xxx -phosphate
buffer for ph values from 3
to 7 or tris-hcl buffer for ph values from 6 to 8.5.
overlapping ph values gave similar results regardless of the buffer used. the figure shows that the
binding increased markedly above ph 4.2, reached
a maximum between ph 6 and 6.5, and then started
to decrease at ph values above 7.2.
relative binding of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin and other proteins. to determine the speci-

ficity and calcium dependency of the binding of
phenoxybenz~ine
to calmodulin, the binding of
phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin, the s-100 protein,
bovine  xxxg124xxx  and  xxxg569xxx  was determined in the presence of ca2+ (0.1 mm) and in the
absence of ca*+ (0.3 mm egta). of these proteins,
only calmodulin displayed a high degree of calciumdependent binding to phenoxybenzamine
(binding
in the presence of ca2+ = 0.62 + 0.02 molfmol
calmodulin). there was no significant binding to
calmodulin in the absence of ca*+ and no significant
binding to bovine  xxxg124xxx  or to cytochrome
c in the absence or presence of ca*+. the brain
specific calcium-binding
 xxxg1850xxx -100 displayed
some calcium-dependent
binding
to phenoxybenzamine
(0.14 mol/mol ~almodulin}; however,
this binding was substantially less than that observed
with calmodulin,
and some calcium-independent
binding to the s-100 protein was also apparent
(0.08 mol/mol calmodulin).

ineffective
in
preventing
the
binding
of
[3h]phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin. yohimbine,
although it did not bind to calmodulin when present
 xxxd1891xxx  pm (fig. l), partially inhibited the binding of
[3h]phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin when present
at 50 ,um (table 2).
it is surprising that the serotonin antagonists
methiothepine
and metergoline were both good
inhibitors of the binding, although methiothepine
has been reported to exhibit some antidopaminergic
activity. of particular interest are the effects of drugs
such as loperamide,  xxxd3050xxx  and triprolidine on
the binding of [3h]phenoxybenzamine.
loperamide,
an opiate agonist, has been reported to inhibit the
calmodulin-stimulated
activity of phosphodiesterase
although this property has been found to be independent of the opioid agonist activity. this anticalmodulin effect is now confirmed in this study
where loperamide displayed a relatively high potency
in inhibiting the binding of [3h]phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin.  xxxd3050xxx  and triphrolidine are two
antihistamic agents with chemical structures similar
to the general structure required for other calmodulin antagonists as proposed by prozialeck and
weiss [19]. as expected, they apparently bind to
calmodulin since they prevented the binding of
[3h]phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin.
discussion

a number of drugs of diverse chemical structures
and pharmacological activities have been shown to
inhibit the biological activity of calmodulin [25,26].
among these are certain of the alpha-adrenergic
blocking agents [21,22]. in particular, phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine were reported to be
fairly potent irreversible inhibitors of the calmodulininduced stimulation of the activity of phosphodiesterase [22]. the results presented in this report

2744

m. ciminoand b.

show that phenoxybenzamine
inhibited calmodulin
by directly and irreversibly binding to it in a calciumdependent
manner.
the interaction
between phenoxybenzamine
and
calmodulin
is similar in some respects to the interaction between the phenothiazine
antipsychotics
and
calmodulin.
as in the case of the binding of phenothiazine antipsychotics
to calmodulin [ 131, the interaction between phenoxybenzamine
and calmodulin
was dependent
upon ph, temperature
and calcium,
and at saturation there were between 1 and 2 moles
of drug bound
for each mole of calmodulin.
however,
unlike the phenothiazines,
which require
photochemical
activation
to induce an irreversible
binding [ll, 271, phenoxybenzamine
bound to calmodulin
irreversibly
without
being subjected
to
ultraviolet irradiation.
this is also in agreement with
the reports
that both compounds
cause an irreversible inhibition of calmodulin-activated
phosphodiesterase under conditions at which they irreversibly
bind to calmodulin
[ll, 221.
the binding of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin
appears to be relatively specific for this alpha-adrenergic agent since the alphai-antagonist
 xxxd3000xxx , the
alpha*-agonist
clonidine,
and the  xxxg831xxx -antagonist
yohimbine
failed to interact with calmodulin.
studies of the abilities of various compounds
to
prevent the binding of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin showed that the most effective agents were
a group of structurally dissimilar antipsychotics
and
some structurally related, though pharmacologically
dissimilar, compounds.
this suggests that the site at
which phenoxybenzamine
binds on calmodulin may
be similar to that at which the phenothiazines
bind.
another type of selectivity was demonstrated
by
experiments
showing that phenoxybenzamine
failed
to bind to a number of other proteins, such as bsa
and  xxxg569xxx . phenoxybenzamine,
however, did
bind slightly to the  xxxg2038xxx  s-100,
although there was little calcium dependency
for this
binding. the specificity of the binding was further
supported
by its requirement
for calcium and by its
an important
requisite
for demonsaturability,
strating a specific interaction
between a drug and
selective binding sites.
the mechanism
by which phenoxybenzamine
interacts
with calmodulin
is complex and may be
explained,
in part, by the chemical properties
of
phenoxybenzamine.
in aqueous solutions phenoxybenzamine
undergoes
a complex series of decomposition reactions,
initially cyclization to an ethyleneimonium
ion [n-benzyl-n-(1-phenoxy-2-propyl)ethyleneimonium]
followed
by hydrolysis
of the
cyclic intermediate
which occurs at ph values above
6.5 [28]. studies of the ph optimum for the binding
of phenoxybenzamine
with calmodulin showed that
at ph values below 4.2 there was essentially
no
binding; the binding increased
to a maximum
at
about 6.5 and then decreased
to very little binding
at ph values of 8.5. since calmodulin
has a pk, of
about 4.2 and phenoxybenzamine
has a pk, of about
5.0 [28], the results suggest that calmodulin must be
negatively
charged
and phenoxybenzamine
positively charged for the interaction
to occur, a conclusion also drawn from studies of the interaction of
phenothiazines
with calmodulin
[29]. the irre-

weiss

versible binding of phenoxybenzamine
to calmodulin
probably involves an alkylating interaction
between
calmodulin and the highly reactive ethyleneimonium
intermediate
which occurs at the tertiary amine on
phenoxybenzamine
at neutral or alkaline ph values
[30]. however,
the initial interaction
between
phenoxybenzamine
and calmodulin
appears to be
more dependent
on hydrophobic
bonds and on the
structure and ionization of phenoxybenzamine
rather
than on its alkylating
properties
since alkylating
drugs such as eedq,
 xxxd1665xxx 
and  xxxd2551xxx  are poor calmodulin inhibitors [22].
irreversibly
bound adducts of calmodulin,
such as
that formed by the interaction
between phenoxybenzamine
and calmodulin,
may have several
applications.
a number of irreversibly
bound calmodulin-phenothiazine
adducts have been described
recently [31-341, and some of these have been studied on certain calmodulin-dependent
enzymes. the
results suggest that these agents may be useful for
selective pharmacological
intervention
of calmodulin
activity. for example, newton etal. [32,33] prepared
and studied a covalent complex of calmodulin with
norchlorpromazine
isothiocyanate.
they found that
this adduct inhibited
the calmodulin-induced
activation of phosphodiesterase
and myosin light chain
kinase but acted as a partial agonist with phosphoprotein phosphatase.
in our laboratory we have prepared and studied a
complex formed by ultraviolet
irradiation
of calmodulin and chlorpromazine
(cpz-cm)
[35]. this
cpz-cm complex inhibited the calmodulin-induced
activation
of phosphodiesterase
at concentrations
that had no effect on the basal activity of the
phosphodiesterase.
however, this complex failed to
block the calmodulin-induced
activation of atpase
at concentrations
that almost totally blocked the
calmodulin-induced
activation of phosphodiesterase.
suggesting
that the complex has a degree of selectivity for certain calmodulin-sensitive
enzymes.
the results of these studies indicate that this cpzcm adduct acts not on calmodulin
but rather on
specific calmodulin
binding
sites of calmodulindependent
enzymes.
the
covalent
interaction
between
phenoxybenzamine
and calmodulin
has been used by
lukas et al. [36] to prepare several adducts having
different molar ratios of drug to calmodulin.
these
adducts of calmodulin and phenoxybenzamine
have
a reduced ability to activate phosphodiesterase
or
myosin light chain kinase.
these studies suggest that the different irreversibly
bound adducts of calmodulin may be useful as tools
to study the many biological functions of calmodulin
and perhaps to selectively modulate the various calmodulin-mediated
processes.
