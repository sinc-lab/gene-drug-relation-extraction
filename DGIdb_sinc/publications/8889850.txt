abstract
although bisphosphonates have been shown to be potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vivo
and in vitro and are used as therapeutic agents in hyper-resorptive bone diseases such as paget disease or
hypercalcemia of malignancy, their exact biochemical target(s) and mode(s) of action are for the most part still
unknown. the resorption of bone requires solubilization of the mineral component of the matrix, achieved by
acidification of the resorbing compartment by a vacuolar-type proton atpase (v-atpase) present in the ruffled
border membrane of osteoclasts. since we have shown that the v-atpase is inhibited by both adp and phosphate,
which share structural characteristics with bisphosphonates, we hypothesized that inhibition of the osteoclast
v-atpase could be one of the mechanism(s) by which bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption. pyrophosphate
and the bisphosphonates  xxxd2063xxx , alendronate, and ym-175 inhibited proton transport in membrane vesicles
derived from chicken kidney and osteoclasts but with very low potency (icso z 5 mm). in contrast, the ability of
= 1.1 mm) and
 xxxd3376xxx  to inhibit proton transport was 5-fold higher in kidney-derived vesicles (ks0
10,000-fold higher in vesicles derived from osteoclasts
= 466 nm).  xxxd3376xxx  also potently inhibited proton
transport in yeast microsomal preparations (ic5,, = 3.5 pm) and inhibited the activity of purified yeast v-atpase.
the inhibition of the osteoclast v-atpase-mediated proton transport by  xxxd3376xxx  was rapid, ph-dependent,
and reversible. no change in membrane vesicle permeability to protons was detected. the inhibition was
noncompetitive with respect to atp, and  xxxd3376xxx  did not protect the pump from inactivation by n- xxxd2684xxx , strongly suggesting that  xxxd3376xxx  does not bind to the catalytic site of the enzyme. it is concluded that
 xxxd3376xxx  is a significantly more potent inhibitor of v-atpases than other bisphosphonates and that it has a
significant degree of selectivity for the avian osteoclast v-atpase relative to the avian kidney v-atpase. (j bone

introduction
evekal hone diseases,
including paget disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and osteoporosis, are characterized by elevated osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, a
process which requires acidification by osteoclasts.(') the
lowering of the ph in the bone resorbing compartment,
which underlies osteoclasts at their site of attachment to the
bone matrix, results from the activity of vacuolar-type proton-atpases that are present in large numbers in the osteoclast's ruffled border
the osteoclast vatpase is therefore a major potential target for reducing

s

osteoclast activity. the main limitation to such an approach
is that all cells express proton pumps in intracellular organelles and/or at the plasma membrane.".") nonspecific
inhibition of proton transport would therefore lead to a
systemic alteration of cellular physiology and acid- base
regulation.
w e previously characterized the basic catalytic parameters of v-atpase-mediated proton transport from osteoclast and kidney membrane vesicles and described the catalytic mechanism involved."' atp is the single substrate,
and phosphate and adp are the two products. according to
this model, phosphate, which exhibits noncompetitive kinet-

ics, is released first, and adp, a competitive inhibitor, is
released second. our findings of an elevated k,,, for atp
and mg2+ (-3-fold) and a decreased k, of adp and phosphate (2- to 3-fold) in the osteoclast relative to the kidney
preparation, suggests that the osteoclast v-atpase is more
susceptible to regulation by local changes in the amounts of
the substrate and products than the kidney v-atpase,
further suggesting that the two pumps may differ.'?)
our observation that the inhibitory potency of phosphate
with respect to v-atpase-mediated proton transport differs in vesicle preparations derived from kidney and osteoclast raised the possibility that other phosphate-containing
compounds, such as the bisphosphonates, may behave similarly. bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphate (pp,),
which contain the nonhydrolyzable carbon phosphorous
bond, p-c-p. these compounds, are potent antiresorbing
agents used in the treatment of hyper-resorptive states such
as paget disease and hypercalcemia of malignancy, and
more recently postmenopausal osteoporosis.('") they are
thought to bind strongly to the hydroxyapatite of bone
where they subsequently inhibit bone resorption both in
vivo and in vitro.
despite the increasing and effective clinical application
of these agents, the molecular targets and modes of action
by which bisphosphonates exert their inhibitory effect on
bone resorption are still being elucidated, and it is not yet
clear that all bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by the
same mechanism. it is generally agreed that bisphosphonates d o not impair osteoclast differentiation but rather
decrease the bone resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts,(l",' i ) although alendronate may also inhibit the formation of multinucleated cells from tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase (trap)-positive mononuclear cells.(12) it has
been demonstrated that the bisphosphonate alendronate is
localized in very high concentrations under resorbing osteoclasts and may even specifically enter the cytosol of these
cells.('") recently, schmidt and coworkers reported that
alendronate inhibits osteoclast protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity.(i2) another possible inhibitory mechanism
is suggested by the observations that bisphosphonates inhibit the ability of isolated osteoclasts plated on bone to
acidify the resorbing lacuna or to recover from artificial acid
load by nh,' in the absence of nat.(i3,l4) it was also
demonstrated, independently, that acid-loaded osteoclasts
plated on bone exhibited a na+-independent proton extrusion that was inhibited by  xxxd279xxx  , , a known specific
inhibitor of v-atpases.(i4,") taken together with the fact
that phosphate inhibits the  xxxg215xxx ,'?) these reports
suggested that bisphosphonates may directly inhibit
v-atpase-mediated proton transport. we have therefore
examined this possibility by assaying the ability of various
bisphosphonates to inhibit proton transport in kidney- and
osteoclast-derived vesicles.

other materials were purchased from baker (sanford, me,
u.s.a.).

preparations
osteoclasts were isolated from adult laying hens kept on
a calcium-deficient diet for 9 days, as described elsewhere.'") the purified osteoclasts were kept in 90% fetal
calf serum and 10%  xxxd1896xxx  (v:v) and stored at
-70°c. unless otherwise mentioned, membrane vesicles
from highly purified osteoclasts and from chicken kidney
were prepared as previously d e ~ c r i b e d . ' ~ )
the saccharomyces cerevisiue haploid strain x-2180-1 a
(yeast genetic stock center, berkeley) was grown in ypd
medium (1% yeast extract [difco, detroit, mi, u.s.a.], 2%
bactopeptone [difco], 2% dextrose at 30°c) to od600 nm
of 2 au. the procedure for isolation of yeast vacuoles and
purification of the v-atpase was as described in uchida et
al.('?) from 15 1 of cultured yeast, 120 pg of protein (glycerol density 31-33%) with a peak specific activity of 8.5
pmol of p,/mg of protein/minute and 90%  xxxd279xxx  a1
sensitivity, were purified. protein determination was done
by the pierce bca protein assay kit (pierce chemical co.,
rockford, il, u.s.a.) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard.

vesicle acidification assay
the acidification assay was performed as described in
david and baron.(') in brief, unless otherwise specified,
10-15 p g of chicken osteoclast-derived membrane or
50-60 p g of chicken kidney-derived membrane vesicles
were incubated for 7 minutes in 2 ml of acidification buffer
(150 mm kci, 20 mm hepes-koh, 5 mm mgci,, p h
7.45, 5 pm acridine orange, 1.25 p m  xxxd3484xxx ) at 25°c.
since high concentrations of added bisphosphonate o r atp
may induce a change in the medium ph, preliminary titration of all the compounds to p h 7.45 with koh was performed, as well as verification that no change in the p h of
the assay medium occurred between the initiation and termination of the experiments. proton transport was initiated
by addition of potassium atp and monitored by measuring
the quench of acridine orange fluorescence (excitation 490
nm, emission 520 nm, slit width 10 and 20 nm, respectively,
400 v using a hitachi f-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer, tokyo, japan).  xxxd3376xxx  at the concentration range
presented did not alter the fluorescence properties of the
acridine orange dye. the assay was stopped after 250 s by
the addition of 1 p m nigericin. a 10-s interval sampling
record was generated. the initial rate (afiminute) was

firophosphate inhibits v-atpase-mediated proton
trunsport in kidney and osteoclasts
we have previously shown that phosphate inhibits atpdependent proton transport by v-atpases in inside-out
membrane vesicles from chicken kidney and highly purified
osteoclasts. phosphate was found to be a noncompetitive
inhibitor of atp with ic,,, values close to the calculated ki
values of 10.5 and 5.5 mm phosphate for kidney and osteoclast membrane vesicles, respectively."' since bisphosphonates are nonhydrolyzable analogs of pyrophosphate (pp,),
we assessed the effects of pp, on the initial rate of proton
influx into both kidney (fig. 1a) and osteoclast (fig. 1b)
microsomes. pp, inhibited proton transport in both preparations with ic,,, values of 9.6 ? 2.6 mm pp, in kidney
preparations and 4.8 i- 1.5 mm pp, in osteoclast membrane
vesicles. these values are not significantly different from
the values found for phosphate, and, as in the case of
phosphate, the osteoclast preparation was more readily
inhibited by pp, than was the kidney.

pp, in osteoclast preparations (approximately 5 mm;
table 1) and slightly higher in kidney preparations (approximately 10 mm; data not shown). in striking contrast, and as
shown in fig. 2a, the bisphosphonate  xxxd3376xxx  inhibited
the initial rate of proton transport by kidney microsomes
with a 10-fold higher potency than other bisphosphonates,
with an ic,,, of 1067 2 463 p,m  xxxd3376xxx . even more
striking, the ability of  xxxd3376xxx  to inhibit the initial rate of
proton transport in osteoclast microsomes was 3 orders of
magnitude higher (i& = 0.466 2 0.026 p m ) than in
kidney vesicles (fig. 2b). lowering the protein amounts of
kidney membranes in the acidification assay did not increase the potency of  xxxd3376xxx  (data not shown), establishing that this effect is not due to the higher protein
concentration present in our kidney proton transport assay.

osteoclast microsomes (15 fg) were preincubated with increasing concentrations of the presented bisphosphonates in acidification buffer ph 7.45 for 8 minutes. acidification assay, which was
initiated with 1.5 mm atp, was performed, and the initial rate of
proton transport was determined. the results were fitted to the
four-parameter logistic equation, and the ic,,'s obtained are presented.

 xxxd3376xxx  does not increase membrane
permeability to protons
for the acidification assay to provide a reliable measure
of atpase activity, sealed vesicles that are able to maintain
a proton gradient are required. thus, apparent inhibition of
acidification could result from modification of the vesicle
membrane that induces a proton leak. we therefore sought
to rule out the possibility that  xxxd3376xxx  interfered with
acidification by making the membrane more premeable to
protons. to verify that the integrity of the membrane vesicles was not altered by  xxxd3376xxx , vesicles were acidified
as usual by incubating with 1.5 mm atp until a stable
fluorescence signal was obtained (250 s), and the vesicles
were then subjected to one of four different treatments
(fig. 3). in the first case, the h'/k'-ionophore
nigericin
(1.25 pm), which exchanges h + for kt ions and rapidly
dissipates the aph, was introduced. an initial rate of dissipation of aph of 1295 af units/minute was measured,
which represents the maximum change in the permeability
of membranes to protons. we then compared the rate of
dissipation of the aph seen with nigericin to those of: (a)
 xxxd279xxx , (50 nm), a specific inhibitor of the vatpases("); (b) 15 mm edta, which inhibits atpase

v-atpase, high concentrations (>so nm) of  xxxd279xxx 
a l may also cause the vesicles to become slightly leaky. the
fact that 3 pm  xxxd3376xxx , which completely inhibits acidification, does not enhance the rate o f proton leak of osteoclast vesicles compared with that seen in the presence of
other v-atpase inhibitors demonstrates that  xxxd3376xxx 
does not alter the integrity o f the vesicles in our assay and
suggests that the inhibition o f acidification by  xxxd3376xxx  is
indeed due to its specific interference with proton transport
by the v-atpase.

tiludronute inhibits proton transport und a tpuse
activity of the yeast v-atpase
because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities
o f osteoclasts a s starting material for purifying the
v-atpase, we determined if the yeast v-atpase could be
used for these experiments by assaying the v-atpasemediated proton transport activity in yeast vacuoles in the
presence and absence of  xxxd3376xxx  (fig. 4a). acidification of the yeast vacuoles was more sensitive to  xxxd3376xxx 
than that measured in the kidney vesicles preparations
(lc5,, 3.5 pm). we therefore measured the effect of
 xxxd3376xxx  on the activity of v-atpase purified from yeast
vacuoles. as shown in fig. 4b, about 50% of the  xxxd279xxx -sensitive atpase activity (i.e., v-atpase) was inhibited
by 40 p m  xxxd3376xxx , while up to 160 p m alendronate had
n o significant effect. thus,  xxxd3376xxx  inhibits the activity
of the purified v-atpase, suggesting that its inhibition of
proton transport is the result of a direct action on the
enzyme itself.

 xxxd3376xxx  inhibition of proton transport
is rapid und reversible
since only  xxxd3376xxx , of all the bisphosphonates tested,
exhibited such a high potency toward the v-atpase-mediated proton transport of osteoclast membranes, we further
characterized its mechanism of action. to determine
whether the interaction o f  xxxd3376xxx  with its putative target is covalent or noncovalent, the time dependence and
irreversibility o f the inhibition were investigated. first, tilu-

osteoclast membrane vesicles (15 pg of

which either nigericin (1.25 $1).
 xxxd279xxx  a1 (50 nm), edta (is

leak were found to be: nigericin 1295

af units/minute; edta 283 af units/

dronate (350 nm) was preincubated with osteoclast microsomes for various times prior to measuring the acidification
activity. in contrast to the progressive inhibition expected in
the situation where an inhibitor covalently binds to its
target,  xxxd3376xxx  instantaneously inhibited about 35% of
the activity measured under control conditions, and little
further increase in the extent of inhibition was observed
with increasing preincubation periods to a maximum of i6
minutes (fig. 5).
we then determined if the inhibition of acidification by
 xxxd3376xxx  is reversible o r not. osteoclast microsomes were
preincubated for 8 minutes in 100 pl of acidification buffer
in the absence or presence of 0.1 or 2 pm  xxxd3376xxx , and
the samples were then diluted with acidification buffer to 2
ml to give final  xxxd3376xxx  concentrations of 0,o. 1 , o r 2 p m
(fig. 6). the degree of inhibition was related to the concentration of  xxxd3376xxx  during the acidification phase and
not to the concentration of  xxxd3376xxx  during the preincubation. the presence of 2 pm  xxxd3376xxx  in the assay
inhibited 95-100% of the total acidification (columns 2 and
4), regardless of the  xxxd3376xxx  concentration in the preincubation period, while a final concentration of 0.1 p m
 xxxd3376xxx  inhibited the acidification by only 5% (column
3). when 2-pm  xxxd3376xxx  (sufficient to totally block the
proton transport) was present in the preincubation period
and the sample was diluted 20-fold to a final concentration
of 0.1 pm  xxxd3376xxx  during the assay (column s), minimal
inhibition was observed. these results indicate that  xxxd3376xxx  inhibition is reversible and that the compound does
not form a covalent adduct with the v-atpase.

 xxxd3376xxx  inhibition of proton transport
is p h dependent
we then assessed the effect of ph of the acidification
medium on the potency of  xxxd3376xxx  as an inhibitor. osteoclast microsomes were preincubated in acidification buffer
at various phs for 8 minutes in the absence and presence o f
1.75 pm  xxxd3376xxx  (fig. 7). the p h optimum for proton
transport in control vesicles was found to be between ph
7.45-7.7. interestingly,  xxxd3376xxx  inhibition of proton
transport was strongly p h dependent. at ph values up to

since the bisphosphonate group could mimic the diphosphate moiety of adp and bind to the catalytic site of the
enzyme, we determined the inhibition kinetics of  xxxd3376xxx  with respect to atp. the initial rate of proton
transport as a function of atp concentration was measured
in the presence and absence of  xxxd3376xxx  (fig. 8). a
concentration of 350 nm  xxxd3376xxx , near its ic,,,, reduced
the v,,, of proton pumping of the osteoclast preparation
from 793 +- 3.5 to 534 5 45 af unitsiminute, without
significantly altering the k,,, for atp (223 5 31 pm atp vs.
280 2 71 pm atp for control and  xxxd3376xxx , respectively). thus, the inhibition by  xxxd3376xxx  is of the noncompetitive type. as expected for noncompetitive inhibition, the
double reciprocal transformation (fig. 8, inset) reveals
changes in both the slope and they-intercept of the resulting lines. thus, two different ki’s can be derived: ( 1 ) from

and (2) from the slopes, the inhibitory constant of the
inhibitor due to its interaction with the free enzyme
(k,,).(") the k,, for  xxxd3376xxx  was 721 nm, while the k,,
was 404 nm. thus,  xxxd3376xxx  can apparently interact with
both the working pump and the free enzyme, with an apparent 2-fold stronger affinity for the free enzyme.

 xxxd3376xxx  does not protect the v-atpase from
inactivation by nem
the noncompetitive nature of  xxxd3376xxx  inhibition
raises the possibility that  xxxd3376xxx  may interact with the
v-atpase at a site other than the catalytic site. to test
further this possibility, we determined if  xxxd3376xxx  was
able to prevent the irreversible inhibition of v-atpases by
nem. nem inhibits the v-atpases by modifying the -sh
group of a conserved cysteine residue (cys 254) located in
catalytic subunit a of v-atpases, within the atp binding
site.('.*'') modification of this cysteine by nem causes complete inactivation of the enzyme. this cysteine residue resides within the "p-loop" of the catalytic site, inside the
consensus nucleotide binding motif g(x),gkt/s,(2'' and is
conserved in all eukaryotic v-atpases but absent in the
f-type atpases, which are therefore virtually resistant to
this inhibitor.'") it has been shown that any compound that
binds to and/or sterically blocks access to this cysteine
residue will protect the v-atpase from inactivation by
nem.(22-24)to test whether  xxxd3376xxx  could prevent inactivation of acidification by nem, osteoclast microsomes
were incubated with 3.8 p m nem for 10 minutes in 100 p1
of acidification buffer (ph 7.5) in the absence or presence
of 100 p m  xxxd3376xxx  (fig. 9). at the end of the incubation, dithiothreitol (dtt) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to stop any further nem reaction. since the
presence of  xxxd3376xxx  in the acidification assay inhibits
pump activity by itself, we diluted the samples to 2 ml with
acidification buffer to yield a final concentration of 5 p m
 xxxd3376xxx . however, this concentration of  xxxd3376xxx  still
inhibits pump activity completely at the favorable p h of 7.5.

the absence (0)or presence (a) of 1.75 p m  xxxd3376xxx .
the acidification assay was initiated with 1.5 mm atp, and
the initial rate was determined.

to allow the acidification assay to be performed, we took
advantage of the fact that  xxxd3376xxx  inhibition is p h sensitive above p h 7.3. we thus performed the acidification
assays at p h 6.8 rather than ph 7.5. under these conditions,
we reduced the inhibition by 5 p m  xxxd3376xxx  from 100%
to about 35% (column 2). in the absence of  xxxd3376xxx ,
nem inactivated 75% of the proton pumping activity (column 3).  xxxd3376xxx  did not antagonize the inactivating
effect of nem, but rather reduced the activity further to a
level that was about 60% of the activity seen in vesicles
treated with nem alone (column 4).this result suggests
that  xxxd3376xxx  does not interact with the catalytic binding
site of the osteoclast v-atpase to inhibit proton transport.

the mechanism that is responsible for this effect of bisphosphonates is not known,
we considered the possibility that the bisphosphonate group
of the compounds directly inhibits the v-atpase in a manner analogous to that of phosphate, a product of catalytic
atp hydrolysis, that we have previously shown to inhibit
v-atpase-mediated acidification in vesicular proton transport assays.") we therefore investigated the effects of pp,
and several bisphosphonates on the v-atpase-catalyzed
acidification of membrane vesicles, derived from highly
purified chicken osteoclasts and chicken kidney, to determine whether the bone-sparing activities of the bisphosphonates might result, at least in part, from inhibition of the
v- atpase.

avian kidney and osteoclast membrane vesicles with a low

similar to the k, of phosphate.(') as with phosphate, the

fig. 9.  xxxd3376xxx  does not protect the osteoclast vatpase from nem inactivation. osteoclast microsomes
(20 fg) were preincubated for 10 minutes in 100 pl of
acidification buffer, ph 7.5, that contained either no or 3.8
p m nem in combinations either in the absence or presence of 100 p m  xxxd3376xxx  (as indicated). the samples
were then diluted into 2 ml of acidification buffer, p h 6.9,
that contained 0.5 mm dtt, for an additional 5 minutes of
preincubation. proton transport assay was initiated with 1.5
mm atp. this figure represents one of four similar experiments that yielded similar results.

ym175, we observed that  xxxd3376xxx , a bisphosphonate in
which the side chain is a (4-~hlorophenyl)-thiomethylene,
was more potent than the others at inhibiting proton transport in kidney vesicles (lc,ll = 1 mm) and, unexpectedly,
had a much greater inhibitory effect on proton transport in
osteoclast vesicles than in kidney vesicles. thus, the ic,,, (at
p h 7.45) with osteoclast vesicles was approximately so0
nm, i.e., 2000-fold lower than that for the kidney membranes and 10,000-fold lower than the ic,,, values for the

1506
inhibition of acidification of osteoclast vesicles by other
bisphosphonates.
if it could be confirmed that  xxxd3376xxx  was directly
inhibiting the v-atpase, this last observation would have
important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of action of bisphosphonates, especially  xxxd3376xxx ,
as well as for our understanding of the mechanism of
proton transport by v-atpases. we therefore performed a
number of control experiments aimed at determining how
 xxxd3376xxx  was exerting its effect. first,  xxxd3376xxx  was
found to inhibit proton transport in yeast vacuoles and,
most important, to inhibit directly the activity of the vatpase purified from yeast vacuoles. currently, we do not
have an explanation for the fact that 40 p m  xxxd3376xxx  was
required to achieve 50% inhibition of the purified enzyme,
while the ic,,, for the acidification assay is about 3.5 pm;
however, qualitatively similar differences in the sensitivities
of purified v-atpases and membrane preparations have
been reported for other inhibitors, including  xxxd279xxx 
a , .(2”.22.25.2(’3 we also demonstrated that  xxxd3376xxx  did
not cause the osteoclast vesicles to become leaky to protons.
the results of these experiments unequivocally demonstrate that  xxxd3376xxx  can inhibit v-atpases and exclude
the possibility that the inhibition of acidification in the
vesicle preparations is simply due to a  xxxd3376xxx -induced
change in membrane permeability or to some indirect effect
on proton transport.
we have partially characterized  xxxd3376xxx ’s mechanism.
the inhibition of proton transport was neither time-dependent nor irreversible, indicating that  xxxd3376xxx  does not
covalently modify the v-atpase and was noncompetitive
with respect to atp. the noncompetitive nature of the
inhibitory effect, together with the inability of  xxxd3376xxx  to
protect the atpase from inactivation by nem, which covalently interacts with a conserved cysteine residue within
the nucleotide binding site in all the v-atpases, may suggest that  xxxd3376xxx  does not bind to the active site of the
enzyme. finally, the p h dependence of the inhibitory effect
of  xxxd3376xxx  suggests that it may bind to a site in the
osteoclast v-atpase with a p k , equal to the p h optimum
of proton transport (-ph 7.5).* the coincidence of the p h
of maximal inhibition with the optimal p h of pumping
activity of the osteoclast v-atpase (ph 7.45-7.7) suggests
that the functional status of the pump may affect  xxxd3376xxx  binding, although further investigation will be necessary to confirm this.
the nearly 10,000-fold higher potency of  xxxd3376xxx  (in
the pm range) relative to those of pp, and the other
bisphosphonates (in the 5-10 mm range) is evidence that
the (4-~hlorophenyl)-thiomethyleneside chain of  xxxd3376xxx  plays a critical role in providing the molecule with
its capability to bind to and/or inhibit the v-atpase, and
that the bisphosphonate moiety of the molecule makes little
or no contribution to the specificity and/or affinity of tilu-

*the ph optimum of the inhibitory effect, between 7.4 and 7.7,
is unlikely to be due to the deprotonation of one of the titratable
groups on  xxxd3376xxx , since the pka values of the bisphosphonate
moiety are 1.3, 3.2, 6.9, >11.

david et al.
dronate. the low potency of alendronate,  xxxd2063xxx , and
ym175 for inhibiting vesicle acidification makes it unlikely
that their ability to block osteoclastic bone resorption is the
result of inhibiting the osteoclast v-atpase. thus, our
study and that of schmidt and colleagues(’*) together suggest that different bisphosphonates may act on different
molecular targets in the osteoclast, depending on the side
chain of the molecule. if this is indeed true, the fact that the
order of potency of the various bisphosphonates that we
have tested on proton transport by chicken osteoclast vesicles does not match that of their effects on bone resorption
in vitro or in vivo is not surprising, since a number of
factors, in particular the facility by which the various compounds enter the cell, make it unlikely that the relationship
between dosage levels and intracellular concentrations will
be the same for all these compounds. in any case, our
resultsclearly demonstrate that  xxxd3376xxx  inhibits the osteoclast v-atpase, an enzyme that is absolutely required for
bone resorption, and at concentrations that are within the
range of intracellular levels that are likely to be attained
under the conditions used in the earlier in vitro and in
viva(") studies of the compound.
the variable difference in  xxxd3376xxx  potency as an inhibitor of proton transport in osteoclast microsomes compared with yeast (nearly 10-fold) and avian kidney membrane vesicles (2000-fold) is most intriguing. of all the
potential differences in pharmacology and kinetics of the
avian osteoclast and kidney enzymes that we have previously reported,(’37,27)this is by far the largest, and it lends
further support to the possibility that the v-atpases in the
osteoclast and kidney preparations differ in some way. it
has not yet been possible to identify the structural o r environmental determinants that are responsible for such pharmacological differences, however. one possible explanation
for such a difference is our recent finding that two distinct
messages for alternatively spliced forms of the catalytic
subunit a of the v-atpase are present in chicken tissues,
thereby theoretically allowing the assembly of distinct tissue-, cell-, or organelle-specific catalytic domains.(”) however, since proton transport in yeast vacuolar vesicles as
well as the purified yeast v-atpase were also highly sensitive to  xxxd3376xxx , this possibility seems less likely.
in conclusion, we have shown that  xxxd3376xxx , but not
other bisphosphonates, is a potent inhibitor of the osteoclast v-type h+-atpase, the enzyme that is responsible for
acidifying the resorption compartment during bone resorption. furthermore,  xxxd3376xxx  has a significantly greater
potency against the osteoclast v-atpase than against the
kidney enzyme in the in vitro acidification assay used in
these studies. thus,  xxxd3376xxx  shows particular promise as
a specific antagonist of osteoclastic bone resorption.
