summary
a family of five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (machr) has
been identified based on their molecular structures and second signal transduction
pathways.
in the present study, we examined the antagonist binding profiles of
9 muscarinic antagonists (atropine, 4-damp,  xxxd2965xxx , oxybutynin, tiquizium,
timepidium, propiverine,  xxxd1813xxx  and zamifenacin) for human muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor subtypes (ml, m2, m3, m4 and ms) produced by using a
baculovirus infection system in sf9 insect cells, and rat tissue membrane
preparations (heart and submandibular gland). in a scopolamine methyl chloride
[n-methyl-3h]([3h]nms)
binding
assay,  xxxd2965xxx 
and timepidium
displayed the highest affinities for the ml and rm subtypes, respectively, and both
zamifenacin and  xxxd1813xxx  had the highest
affinities for the m3 subtype,
although the selectivities among the five subtypes were less than lo-fold.
propiverine showed a slightly higher affinity for the m5 subtype, whereas none of
the drugs used in this study was uniquely selective for the m4 subtype.
the
binding affinities of muscarinic antagonists for rat heart and submandibular gland
strong correlated with those for human cloned m2 and m3 subtypes, respectively.
these data suggest that [3h]nms binding studies using rat heart and
submandibular gland might be useful methods which predict the affinities of test
drugs for human muscarinic

m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes.

key words: machr subtype, selective antagonist, sf9 insect cells, heart, submandibular gland

muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (machr) are members of a superfamily of g proteincoupled receptors which mediate many actions of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine in the
central and peripheral nervous systems (1)
molecular cloning studies identified five subtypes
of machr genes (ml-rns) widely expessed in various tisses (2,3,4).
all of these receptors are
predicted to share a similar three-dimensional
structure consisting of a tightly packed bundle of
seven transmembrane
helices linked by three extracellular and three intracellular loops (5).
pharmacological studies have revealed four different subtypes of machr (mi-m4) based on
their ability to bind specific ligands and activate different second signal transduction pathways,
whereas the ligand binding properties of ms receptors have not been characterized in vivo (6,7).
however, conventional
pharmacological
studies of machr subtypes in animal tissues are

2352

machrs in heart and submandibular gland

vol. 64, no. 25,1999

complicated because most tissues express a mixture of different types of machr genes (8,9).
some agents have been found to distinguish the affinity among machr subtypes.
for
example,  xxxd2965xxx  has a high affmity for the mi subtype (io), as does af-dxl16 for the
m2 subtype (1 l), hexahydrosiladifenidol
for the m3 subtype (12), secoverine and  xxxd3450xxx 
for the m4 subtype (13) and no specific ligands are known for the ms subtype.
but highly
selective ligands for the individual subtypes are not available at present.
although several
studies demonstrated distribution of mach subtypes in several tissues using subtype-specific
antisera (i 4,1.5,16,17), the precise tissue distribution of the various types of machr has yet to
be determined conclusively.
recently, the ligand specificity of the ml -rns subtypes has been
examined by using receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes (18). mammalian cultured ceils
(3,4,19,20) or insect cells (2 1). these systems can express individual subtypes of machr and
produce relatively large amounts of receptor proteins. thus, these studies may facilitate a correct
classification of the subtype-specific ligand binding profiles of muscarinic antagonists.
in the present study, we examined the binding properties of 9 muscarinic antagonists to
individual subtypes of machr produced by using a baculovirus infection system in sf9
(spodopreru fugiperda ) insect cells and rat tissue membrane preparations (submandibular
gland and heart).

figure 1 illustrates that the binding
properties of muscarinic antagonists to machr in rat heart and submandibular
gland have
strong correlations to human cloned m2 (fig. i a) and m3 (fig. 1b), respectively.

discussion
differences in ligand binding properties have been the most reliable means of discriminating
receptors and their subtypes.
conventional
pharmacological
studies have revealed that
 xxxd2965xxx  and telenzepine have high affinities for mt (10,27), as does af-dx116 for m2
(1 l), hexahydrosiladifenidol
and zamifenacin for m3 (i 2,28), and secoverine and  xxxd3450xxx 
for m4 (13).
in the present study, we examined the binding properties of 9 muscarinic antagonists to the
individual subtypes of machr using a baculovirus infection system in st9 insect cells.
we
employed nms as a radioligand, which has a strong and relatively similar affinity for the five
in our study,  xxxd2965xxx  and zamifenacin showed the highest
subtypes of machr (29).
affinities for the ml and, m3 subtypes, respectively, although the selectivities among the five
it has been reported that  xxxd2965xxx  has high, low, and
subtypes were less than io-fold.
intermediate affinities for ml, mz and m3 subtypes, respectively, when expressed in cho-ki
cells (19). in contrast, our results showed that  xxxd2965xxx  has high affinity for the ml and m4
subtypes.
this different binding profile might be due to host cell properties. actually, the
sugar contents of machr expressed in st9 cells are different from machr in mammalian
tissue (30).
however, previous studies showed that the removal of sugars from machr by
genetic manipulation
(31) or by endoglycosidase
treatment (32) did not affect their ligand
a previous study with solubilized machr showed that the binding of
binding properties.
subtype-specific
antagonists to machr is generally modulated by the lipid environment of

environment, rather than by the sugar moiety of the receptors.
a previous study showed that ligand binding affinities of muscarinic antagonists were changed
under different experimental condition (34). these changes in affinity were influenced by the
in our
membrane environment of the receptor, which was solubilized with some detergents.
present data, we used membrane-bound
receptors, and all experiments were carried out without
detergent conditions.
subtype-specific ligands have led to the development of better drugs with fewer side effects
as compared with nonspecific ligands, not only to machr but also to other receptors, such as
for example, m t-specific agonists
the adrenergic, serotoninergic and dopaminergic receptors.
have been developed as new drugs for alzheimer’s disease (35) and maspecific antagonists
have also been proposed for the same purpose (36).
in addition, ml- and m3-specific
antagonists, and m3-specific antagonists have been developed as drugs for ulcer or airway
one of the aims of our present
obstruction (37), and for urinary disorders (28), respectively.
study was to identify subtype-specific
ligands for machr.
a large number of screening
studies, including our study, using recombinant machr have revealed that the five subtypes
have very similar ligand binding characteristics and that it is difficult to find subtype-specific
ligands. this probably reflects structural similarities among the ligand binding sites of the five
subtypes, which are thought to be largely composed of transmembrane
segments (38).

although screening systems using recombinant subtypes of receptors could facilitate a correct
classification of the subtype-specific ligand binding profiles of muscarinic antagonists, it will be
difficult to develop highly selective ligands for the individual subtypes as drugs without side
effects.
recently, acuronium, a neuromuscular blocking drug, has been reported to increase [3h]nms
binding to the m2 subtype and only slightly to the m3 subtype, but not the ml, m4, and ms
it is known that the acuronium binding site of machr is distinct from the
subtypes (21).
so, subtype-specific
inhibition or
[3h]nms binding site but located close to it (39,40).
activation might be attained by the combination of a muscarinic antagonist or agonist with a
subtype-specific allosteric ligand (2 1).
the respective affinities of muscarinic antagonists for human m2 and m3 receptors showed
good correlations with those for machr in rat heart and submandibular gland. previous studies
showed that machr proteins found in mammalian heart and submandibular
gland were
detected as of the m2 and m3 subtypes, respectively, by using subtype-specific antibodies, and
that they also expressed m2 and m3 mrna (41.42).
these results indicate that [3h]nms
binding studies using rat heart and submandibular gland might be useful methods that predict
the affinities of test drugs for human muscarinic m2
in conclusion, we have shown that the machr subtypes expressed in sf9 cells have
specificity similar to the subtype-specificity
profiles of machr in mammalian tissues, and
could be useful for screening procedure of subtype-specific anti-muscarinic
drugs, especially
in addition, our present data suggest that the rat

tissues used could be useful for the in viva characterization of selective antimuscarinic drugs to
human subtypes of machrs.
