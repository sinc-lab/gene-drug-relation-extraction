objective— xxxg9xxx  ( xxxg9xxx ) mediates the efflux of lipids from cells to lipid-poor
apolipoproteins. in this article, we characterize the effect of  xxxd3014xxx  on cellular  xxxg9xxx -mediated lipid efflux.
methods and results— xxxd3014xxx  inhibited cholesterol efflux up to 80% in j774 macrophages expressing  xxxg9xxx . in
fu5ah hepatoma cells that contain scavenger receptor class b, type i, but not functional  xxxg9xxx , we observed no effect
of  xxxd3014xxx  on cholesterol efflux.  xxxd3014xxx  inhibited cholesterol efflux from normal human skin fibroblasts but not from
fibroblasts from a tangier patient. fluorescent confocal microscopy and biotinylation assay demonstrated that in j774
cells  xxxd3014xxx  impaired the translocation of  xxxg9xxx  from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane.  xxxd3014xxx 
also inhibited the formation of an  xxxg9xxx -linked cholesterol oxidase sensitive plasma membrane domain. consistent
with the inhibitory effect on  xxxg9xxx  translocation to the plasma membrane,  xxxd3014xxx  reduced cell surface–specific
[125i]-labeled apolipoprotein-ai binding.
conclusions—we conclude that  xxxd3014xxx  is an effective inhibitor of  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux without
influencing scavenger receptor class b type i–mediated efflux. the inhibition of  xxxg9xxx  translocation to the plasma
membrane may in part explain the reported in vivo high-density lipoprotein–lowering action of  xxxd3014xxx . (arterioscler

robucol is a lipid-lowering drug that has been extensively
investigated since its introduction in the early 1970s.1
among its most dramatic effects is the ability to promote the
regression of cutaneous and tendinous xanthoma, and this
effect appears to be independent of its cholesterol-lowering
effect.1,2 however,  xxxd3014xxx  also significantly reduces
plasma high-density lipoproteins (hdls). these facts have
made this drug very controversial. it has been reported that
 xxxd3014xxx  treatment induced a more rapid progression of
atherosclerotic lesions3 in  xxxg177xxx  (apoe) knockout
mice. in contrast, a recent study demonstrated that  xxxd3014xxx 
treatment of scavenger receptor class b type i ( xxxg2013xxx )/apoe
double knockout mice prevents the dramatic early coronary
heart disease and death that is a characteristic of these
animals.4
just as the data on  xxxd3014xxx  effects in vivo are contradictory, so too are the results from a number of experiments that
have been conducted to study the action of  xxxd3014xxx  on
cholesterol metabolism in vitro. yamamoto et al5 measured
the effect of  xxxd3014xxx  on the change in cholesterol mass on
incubation of thp-1 macrophages with hdls and observed
a significant reduction consistent with a  xxxd3014xxx -mediated
increase in the net efflux of cholesterol. a similar result was
obtained by goldberg and mendez6 using human skin fibroblasts. in contrast, a subsequent investigation failed to ob-

serve any  xxxd3014xxx  stimulation in the efflux of cholesterol
from a number of cell types.7 it has been demonstrated that
specific cell surface proteins play an important role in
mediating the flux of cholesterol between cells and extracellular acceptors (for a review see yancey et al8).  xxxg2013xxx 
facilitates the selective uptake of hdl cholesteryl ester (ce)
and enhances the bidirectional flux of free cholesterol (fc)
between cells and hdls.9 atp-binding cassette ai ( xxxg9xxx )
has been shown to bind lipid-free or lipid-poor apoproteins
and to transfer both cholesterol and phospholipid from the
cell membrane to the apoprotein.10,11
even before the identification of  xxxg9xxx  as a mediator of
cell lipid efflux to apoproteins, it was demonstrated that
 xxxd3014xxx  treatment of cells produced a marked inhibition of
 xxxg173xxx –mediated lipid efflux from macrophages.12,13 it has
now been shown that this inhibition is accompanied by
complete or partial inhibition of binding of the apoprotein to
the  xxxd3014xxx -treated cells.14 –16
thus, there is no question that treatment of cells with
 xxxd3014xxx  can impact cellular lipid efflux. however, the effect
of the drug and the mechanisms by which it produces changes
in efflux remain obscure and contradictory. because of a
renewed interest in  xxxd3014xxx , and because of our growing
knowledge of the roles of  xxxg2013xxx  and  xxxg9xxx  on cell
cholesterol flux, we have now conducted studies to obtain
additional information on the effect of  xxxd3014xxx  on lipid flux.

for this investigation, we have focused on the impact of
 xxxd3014xxx  treatment on the expression, intracellular distribution, and cholesterol efflux–mediating ability of  xxxg9xxx .

methods
materials
acetylated low-density lipoproteins (ldls) were prepared as previously described.17  xxxg173xxx  was purified from human blood plasma,
as previously described,18 and it was provided by l. calabresi at
university of milan (italy). [125i]-labeled  xxxg173xxx  (125i  xxxg173xxx ) was
provided by m.a. connelly at state university of new york
(suny, stony brook, ny). for details, please see the online
methods, available at http://atvb.ahajournals.org.

cells
j774 mouse macrophages were cultured in rpmi medium 1640
supplemented with 10% fcs. fu5ah rat hepatoma cells were grown
in dmem with 5% fcs. human fibroblasts were grown in dmem
supplemented with glutamine, nonessential amino acids, sodium
pyruvate, and fcs. all the culture media were supplemented with 50
␮g/ml gentamicin.

assay of cellular cholesterol and
phospholipid efflux
cells were seeded in 24-well plates until 80% confluent. cells were
then labeled with 2 ␮ci/ml [1,2-3h] cholesterol for 24 hours and
subsequently incubated overnight in medium containing 0.2% bsa
with or without either 5 ␮g/ml 22-hydroxycholesterol (22-oh)/
10 ␮mol/l 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  (9cra) or 0.3 mmol/l of 8-(4chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3⬘,5⬘-cyclic monophosphate (cptcamp).19 efflux was promoted to various acceptors after the
incubation of cells with or without 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx . time zero
values were obtained from cell walls harvested before lipid acceptor
addition. the percent release of lipid was calculated as: (cpm in
medium per cpm time zero) ⫻100. for phospholipid efflux assay,
cells were treated as previously described and phospholipids were
extracted by the bligh and dyer method.20

assay of cholesterol oxidase
cholesterol oxidase treatment was essentially as previously described.21 briefly, cells were labeled with 3 ␮ci/ml[3h] cholesterol.
cholesterol oxidase (1 u/ml) was added, and cells were incubated
for 4 hours. lipid was extracted with isopropanol, and radioactive
cholesterol and cholestenone were separated using thin-layer chromatography and quantified.

western blots
cell monolayers were lysed with a 1% triton x-100, 0.5% nonidet
p-40, 10 mmol/l  xxxd3449xxx  and homogenized through a 27-gauge
needle. equal amounts of protein (24 ␮g) were separated on 3% to
8% tris-acetate gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane. blot was performed with an anti- xxxg9xxx  rabbit polyclonal antibody. chemiluminescence was used to visualize the
proteins according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

confocal microscopy
j774 macrophages were grown on 8-well multichamber slides and
incubated with 0.3 mmol/l cpt-camp for 18 hours to induce the
expression of  xxxg9xxx . in each slide, half of the wells were then
treated with 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx  in serum-free medium for 2 hours.
cells were fixed with methanol and incubated with an anti- xxxg9xxx 
rabbit polyclonal antibody for 40 minutes at room temperature, then
incubated with an anti-rabbit ig coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. slides were mounted with a cover slide and observed by
confocal microscopy (molecular dynamics multiprobe 2001). for
further details on the experimental conditions please see online
methods.

j774 cell surface binding of
125
i-lipid–free  xxxg173xxx 
j774 were treated according to the following protocol: during the
efflux period, cells were treated with 125i  xxxg173xxx  in presence or
absence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled  xxxg173xxx  for 4 hours. after
the incubation, cells were washed several times with pbs and lysed
with 0.1 mol/l naoh. radioactivity in cell lysate was measured by
␥-counting, after which aliquots were taken for protein determination. specific binding was calculated by subtraction of nonspecific
from total binding.

cell surface biotinylation assay
cell monolayers were grown in 60-mm petri dishes and incubated
with 0.3 mmol/l cpt-camp for 18 hours to induce the expression of
 xxxg9xxx . half of the dishes were then treated with 10 ␮mol/l
 xxxd3014xxx  in serum-free medium for 2 hours. cells were washed with
pbs and treated with sulfo-nhs-lc-lc-biotin (pierce) in pbs/
calcium-magnesium buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature.
monolayers were washed with pbs supplemented by 100 mmol/l
glycine and were lysed with a 1% triton x-100, 0.5% nonidet p-40,
10 mmol/l  xxxd3449xxx . biotinylated proteins were separated from
nonbiotinylated proteins by using monomeric avidin column
(immunopure immobilized monomeric avidin kit, pierce). biotinylated proteins (14.2 ␮g) were separated on 3% to 8% tris-acetate
gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. western
blot analysis was performed as described.

statistical analysis
results were presented as means and standard deviations of triplicate
determinations. significant differences were established by t test
using graph pad prism (graphpad software inc).

results
efflux of cholesterol to  xxxg173xxx  from j774 macrophages was
stimulated up to 4-fold by the exposure to cpt-camp.
 xxxd3014xxx  treatment for 2 hours inhibited this efflux by
80%⫾0.06 (figure 1). stimulation with cpt-camp upregulated  xxxg9xxx  expression,13 and  xxxd3014xxx  interfered with the
 xxxg9xxx  efflux to lipid-free apolipoproteins without affecting
the protein expression (figure 1, inset). we tested the
 xxxd3014xxx  effect on fu5ah cells, a cell line that expresses high
levels of  xxxg2013xxx  protein, but not functional  xxxg9xxx .22  xxxd3014xxx  did not influence cholesterol efflux from fu5ah to hdl
(% efflux to hdl was 9.98⫾1.28 and 11.24⫾0.69 after
 xxxd3014xxx  pretreatment), showing that the  xxxd3014xxx  effect was
specific for  xxxg9xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux. in j774
cells upregulated for  xxxg9xxx  using the liver x receptor and
retinoic x receptor (lxr-rxr) agonists 22-oh and 9cra
and exposed to  xxxd3014xxx  for 2 hours, 1 ␮mol/l of  xxxd3014xxx 
inhibited efflux by 50% and reached the maximum inhibition
at 5 ␮mol/l (figure ia, available online at http://atvb.
ahajournals.org). we performed a time course experiment
using 10 ␮mol/l of  xxxd3014xxx . the results show a 60%
inhibition of  xxxg173xxx –mediated cholesterol efflux from j774
cells treated with lxr-rxr agonists after only 15 minutes
exposure to  xxxd3014xxx , and by 2 hours cholesterol efflux was
maximally inhibited (figure ib). we next evaluated phospholipid efflux to further test the  xxxd3014xxx  effect on  xxxg9xxx 
activity. the 3-fold increase of phospholipid efflux to  xxxg173xxx 
stimulated by lxr-rxr agonists was abolished in the
presence of  xxxd3014xxx  (% efflux to  xxxg173xxx  was 4.42⫾0.001
and 1.20⫾0.12 after  xxxd3014xxx  pretreatment).

a shows cpt-camp–treated cells; b, control cells; and c, cptcamp–treated cells plus  xxxd3014xxx .

as shown in figure ii (available online at http://atvb.
ahajournals.org), using normal and tangier fibroblasts upregulated for  xxxg9xxx  by incubation with 9-cra and 22-oh,
 xxxg173xxx –mediated efflux was inhibited by  xxxd3014xxx  in normal
fibroblasts but  xxxd3014xxx  treatment had no effect on tangier
cells that are unable to express  xxxg9xxx .
the turnover of  xxxg9xxx  protein can be rapid,11,23 thus
 xxxd3014xxx  inhibition of lipid efflux could be linked to accelerated  xxxg9xxx  turnover and degradation. however, this does
not appear to be the case, because the  xxxd3014xxx  inhibition is
exceptionally rapid (15 minutes; figure ib) and the level of
 xxxg9xxx  protein is not significantly reduced after a 2-hour
exposure to  xxxd3014xxx  (figure 1, inset). because  xxxg9xxx 
localization is in the plasma membrane and late endosome
compartments,24 we used fluorescent confocal microscopy to
determine whether  xxxd3014xxx  could interfere with the protein
distribution in cells. consistent with previous studies,24 we
observed  xxxg9xxx  protein both at the cell periphery and
intracellular locations in cells stimulated by cpt-camp (figure 2a). after a 2-hour exposure to  xxxd3014xxx ,  xxxg9xxx  protein
was almost exclusively present in an intracellular location
(figure 2b). similar results were obtained using j774-loaded
cells by 50 ␮g/ml of acetylated ldls in the same experimental conditions (figure iii, available online at
http://atvb.ahajournals.org).
vaughan and oram25 demonstrated that the expression of
 xxxg9xxx  in cells produces an increase in the size of membrane

chamber slides. after 24 hours, cells were incubated in medium

were then equilibrated with 0.2% bsa and incubated with
0.3 mmol/l cpt-camp for 18 hours before the  xxxd3014xxx  exposure. after the cpt-camp treatment, cells were incubated with
(b) or without (a) 10 ␮m  xxxd3014xxx  as described in methods.
after 2 hours, cells were chilled on ice and then fixed by exposure to methanol for 2 minutes. after fixation, cells were washed
and then incubated 1 hour with the primary rabbit polyclonal
antibody to  xxxg9xxx  diluted 1:50 in dpbs. cells were then
extensively washed and incubated with a fluorescent secondary
antibody for 1 hour.

cholesterol pool. thus, we tested whether  xxxd3014xxx  interfered
with the movement of cholesterol to plasma membrane
domains. to this end, we evaluated cholestenone formation
after exposure of cells to cholesterol oxidase under conditions
leading to oxidation of fc present in the plasma membrane.21
as expected,25 in j774 macrophages the upregulation of
 xxxg9xxx  by cpt-camp increased by almost 3-fold the cholesterol in the plasma membrane sensitive to oxidation by
cholesterol oxidase. this process was absent in cells exposed
to  xxxd3014xxx  (figure 3a). the experiment was also performed
using only 2-hour incubation with the enzyme, and we
obtained similar results (% cholestenone moves from
4.50⫾0.17 in control cells to 9.90⫾0.16 in camp treated
cells, and 2-hour incubation with  xxxd3014xxx  reduces this value
back to 5.90⫾0.60).
we performed a similar experiment using normal and
tangier human skin fibroblasts incubated with the lxr-rxr

or without 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3014xxx . after 2 hours of  xxxd3014xxx  treatment, cells were washed and incubated with (solid bars) or without (open bars) 0.5 u/ml cholesterol oxidase enzyme in dpbs

agonists to upregulate  xxxg9xxx . only in normal cells lxrrxr stimulation induced an increase in the cholesterol
oxidase sensitive pool.  xxxd3014xxx  completely inhibited this
effect. in tangier cells, the cholestenone formation was
unaffected by either lxr-rxr stimulation or  xxxd3014xxx 
treatment (figure 3b).
to test the effect of  xxxd3014xxx  on  xxxg173xxx  cell surface
binding, j774 macrophages, cpt-camp–stimulated, were
treated with  xxxd3014xxx  for 2 hours and 125i- xxxg173xxx  binding was
measured at 4°c. as shown in figure 4, binding was
increased by camp treatment, and exposure to  xxxd3014xxx 
reduced the specific binding of 125i- xxxg173xxx .  xxxd3014xxx  had no
effect on the nonspecific binding. to further provide biochemical support for the concept that  xxxd3014xxx  impaired the
 xxxg9xxx  trafficking from the intracellular compartments to
the plasma membrane, we measured the  xxxg9xxx  localization
on the cell surface by biotinylation assay. the results showed
that the expression of  xxxg9xxx  protein on the cell surface is
fully inhibited by  xxxd3014xxx  (figure 4, inset).

discussion
even before the identification of  xxxg9xxx  as a mediator of
lipid efflux, it was demonstrated that  xxxd3014xxx  treatment of
cells would produce a marked inhibition of apolipoproteinmediated lipid efflux from macrophages.12,13 this inhibition
of lipid efflux to apoproteins was accompanied by an inhibition of binding of the apoprotein to the  xxxd3014xxx -treated
cells.12 in contrast to the apoprotein-mediated efflux,  xxxd3014xxx  was shown not to have an effect on fc efflux to ldl,12
a process that results largely by unmediated or  xxxg2013xxx –
mediated cholesterol exchange.8 using macrophages pretreated with camp, a procedure we now know up regulates
 xxxg9xxx , sakr et al13 demonstrated that exposure to  xxxd3014xxx

during the last 2 hours of equilibration phase. after this, incubation cells were washed with pbs, biotinylation assay was performed, biotinylated proteins were separated from nonbiotinylated proteins by using monomeric avidin column, and

produced a rapid and marked inhibition of  xxxg173xxx –mediated
efflux.
one of the most dramatic effects of  xxxd3014xxx  treatment of
j774 macrophages is the rapidity (15 minutes) of the inhibition of lipid efflux to  xxxg173xxx  in j774-expressing  xxxg9xxx .
because of the pronounced hydrophobicity of  xxxd3014xxx , it can
be anticipated that the compound rapidly partitions into the
cell membrane. both fc and phospholipid efflux are inhibited, and this inhibition appears to be specific to abca1mediated efflux. specificity is demonstrated by the lack of
inhibition of efflux from tangier fibroblasts and the observation that the treatment of fu5ah rat hepatoma cells to the
drug had no impact on the efflux of cholesterol to hdl, a
process that has been shown to be largely mediated by
 xxxg2013xxx .22
there are a number of mechanisms by which  xxxd3014xxx 
could exert its inhibitory effect. rapidity of  xxxd3014xxx  effect
and western blot analysis (figure ib and figure 1, inset)
exclude an effect on  xxxg9xxx  expression or degradation.
studies by vaughan and oram25 demonstrated that the

favari et al
presence of  xxxg9xxx  in the plasma membrane of baby hamster
kidney cells resulted in an increase in the pool of cholesterol
in the plasma membrane that became susceptible to oxidation
by cholesterol oxidase. here we demonstrated that upregulation of  xxxg9xxx  in j774 results in an increase in cholesterol
oxidase-sensitive cholesterol pool and that  xxxd3014xxx  completely inhibited the formation of this lipid domain (figure
3a). that this increase in sensitivity to cholesterol oxidase is
an  xxxg9xxx -linked response is further demonstrated by the
observation that treatment of normal human fibroblasts with
lxr-rxr ligands resulted in an increase in the size of the
oxidase-sensitive pool and elevated cholesterol efflux which
was inhibited by  xxxd3014xxx . a similar treatment of tangier
fibroblasts produced none of these responses (figure 3b). it
has been reported that camp-treated cells exposed to  xxxd3014xxx  exhibit reduced specific binding of  xxxg173xxx  compared with
control cells.12 in this study,  xxxd3014xxx  largely inhibited
camp-induced upregulation of binding, whereas in a previous study there was a somewhat less dramatic inhibition.16
differences in the experimental conditions can account for
the observed differences in binding. the previous study used
cholesterol-loaded cells,16 whereas in the present protocol the
cells were cholesterol-normal. cell cholesterol enrichment
may increase the binding of an extracellular acceptor independently of cellular metabolism,26 an effect that might
oppose the inhibitory activity of  xxxd3014xxx . neufeld et al24
demonstrated that  xxxg9xxx  protein resides both on the cell
surface and on intracellular vesicles and traffics between
these 2 compartments. in this study, the reduced lipid efflux,
cholesterol membrane pool, and  xxxg173xxx  binding produced by
 xxxd3014xxx  correlate well with the shift in the distribution of
 xxxg9xxx  from the plasma membrane compartment to an
internal location, as evidenced by confocal analysis and
biotinylation assay (figure 2, figure iii, and figure 4, inset).
recently, an inhibitory effect of  xxxd3014xxx  on  xxxg173xxx  binding
was also reported in wi-38 human fibroblasts.27 however,
these authors did not observe any effect of  xxxd3014xxx  on
 xxxg9xxx  protein or cholesterol cellular distribution. we do not
have a clear explanation for this apparent discrepancy with
our present data. the difference in cell lines and conditions of
 xxxd3014xxx  presentation to cells may account for some of the
different conclusions reached in this article.
administration of  xxxd3014xxx  to both humans and animals
has been shown to lower hdl levels.28 this effect involves
a  xxxd3014xxx -related increase of plasma ce transfer protein and
a production of hdl with an enhanced ability to promote
cholesterol efflux.29 we propose that in addition to this
mechanism the drug may reduce hepatic hdl production by
inhibiting the  xxxg173xxx  interaction with  xxxg9xxx . despite the
reduction in hdl,  xxxd3014xxx  is still very effective in promoting the regression of xanthomas.2,5 also, a study by braun et
al4 demonstrated that administration of  xxxd3014xxx  to  xxxg2013xxx /
apoe double knockout mice reversed red blood cell abnormal
morphology, restored normal fc/ce ratios, and blocked the
development of coronary heart disease. a number of different
mechanisms could be responsible for  xxxd3014xxx -mediated
regression of xanthomas and its antiatherogenic effects. a
decrease in foam cell lipid content, and hence regression of
xanthomas, could reflect either a reduction in cholesterol

 xxxd3014xxx  inhibition of  xxxg9xxx  lipid efflux

influx or stimulation of macrophage cholesterol efflux.  xxxd3014xxx  is a potent antioxidant, and the presence of the drug in
plasma has been shown to increase the resistance of ldl to
oxidative modification and the subsequent uptake of modified
ldl by scavenger receptors.2 an alternative hypothesis is
that enhanced efflux of cholesterol plays a role in xanthoma
regression. the results of this study demonstrate that a
 xxxd3014xxx  stimulation of macrophage cholesterol efflux would
not occur through an  xxxg9xxx  pathway. in the absence of
 xxxg9xxx -mediated efflux, passive diffusion or  xxxg2013xxx  appears
to be a good candidate. however, it is unlikely that  xxxd3014xxx 
is acting directly on cells to increase the level or activity of
 xxxg2013xxx , because drug treatment of  xxxg2013xxx –rich fu5ah cells
failed to enhance cholesterol efflux to hdl, and feeding
 xxxd3014xxx  to mice does not change the  xxxg2013xxx  mrna14 or
protein30 in liver. rather, it is possible that  xxxd3014xxx  may
generate lipoprotein particles more active in promoting net
cholesterol efflux from foam cells. in support of this model is
the observation by rinninger et al30 that hdl from probucoltreated mice have increased ce selective uptake into chinese
hamster ovary cells compared with control mouse hdl.
these modifications in hdl composition could also increase
 xxxg2013xxx  bidirectional flux of fc and the net flux of cholesterol
