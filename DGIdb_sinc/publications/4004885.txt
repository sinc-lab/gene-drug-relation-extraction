abstract-- xxxd269xxx  (c9- - xxxd2537xxx ) is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase and some oxidoreductase in vitro, and in vivo has a beneficial effect on lentigo maligna and malignant melanoma. a
definite cytotoxic effect in cultures of malignant melanocytes was also reported. in order to establish if
the cytotoxic effect of the diacid is exerted equally in the absence of tyrosinase, lymphoma- and
leukemia-derived cell lines were cultured for 72 hr with 10 -3 m, 10 -2 m and 5 x 10 2 m c9 disodium
salt.
normal resting lymphocytes, lymphocytes activated by phytohemoagglutinin, and mouse balb/c 3t3
fibroblasts were also tested to study a possible effect of  xxxd269xxx  on dna synthesis and cell
duplication. at t0 3 m c9 had no effect on the viability of all the cells tested;  xxxd1891xxx  -2 m and 5 x 10 ~ m,
c9 2na had a 50-80% cytotoxie effect on lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines, while at the same
concentrations it was not toxic to normal lymphocytes, either resting or stimulated, or to 3t3 fibroblasts.
the experiments on cellular incorporation of (1-9 ~4c)  xxxd269xxx  showed that the radiocarbon uptake
was two to three times higher for lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines than for lymphocytes.
either resting or stimulated, or 3t3 fibroblasts.
biochemical analysis revealed that the diacid underwent beta-oxidation in all the cell cultures.
fractionated centrifugations of 3t3 fibroblasts cultured in the presence of radiolabelled  xxxd269xxx 
(2 x 10 4 m) plus cold c9 2na (10 -~ m), showed that the radioactivity was mainly concentrated in the
cytoplasm. the results, being similar to those obtained by adding  xxxd269xxx  to cultures of melanoma
cells, suggest that the cytotoxic effect of  xxxd269xxx  may be due to interference with mitochondrial
oxido-reductase enzymes, rather than with tyrosinase.
the difference in reaction between lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines and normal or
stimulated lymphocytes, and 3t3 fibroblasts, could be explained on the basis of a different degree of
permeability of the cell membrane, and/or to a possible different sensitivity of reaction of mitochondrial
functions. a similar argument could be used to explain the absence of an effect of dicarboxylic acids
upon normal as compared with hyperactive or malignant melanocytes in vivo.

dicarboxylic acids from c8 to c13 are a group of
non-toxic non-teratogenic substances [1] whose biological activity has been discovered only recently.
they are competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase [2] and
of some mitochondrial respiratory enzymes [3] in
vitro; the c9 and c12 dicarboxylic acids applied in
vivo, topically in a cream, have proved effective in
the t r e a t m e n t of metasma, post-inflammatory melanosis [4] and lentigo maligna [5, 6]. clinically and
histologically it has been demonstrated that  xxxd269xxx 
acid (c9  xxxd2537xxx ) has a definite cytotoxic
effect on malignant melanocytes of primary
cutaneous m e l a n o m a [7, 8], though normal melanocytes appeared not to be affected [5, 9].
as suggested for some melanocytotoxic phenolic
c o m p o u n d s which are substrates for tyrosinase
[10, 11], the melanocytotoxicity of  xxxd269xxx  might
be due to its capability of inhibiting tyrosinase, the
key enzyme for the formation of melanin. h o w e v e r ,
evidence has recently accumulated suggesting that

the action of dicarboxylic acids is not strictly correlated with anti-tyrosinase activity. ultrastructural
autoradiography of m e l a n o m a cells exposed to labelled c12 showed no radioactivity at sites of location
of tyrosinase within the cells, but rather in mitochondria and nucleus [12]. several authors [13, 14]
are at present emphasizing that an important feature
of the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs is their impairment of mitochondrial function, and there is significant evidence that dicarboxylic acids may exert
an anti-mitochondrial effect. their involvement with
mitochondrial function was initiallv demonstrated by
studies on the metabolism of c9-c12 dicarboxylic
acids, showing that, when orally administered to
rat and man, they are partially metabolized by the
mitochondrial beta oxidative enzymes [15]. beta oxidation of the diacids was also shown to occur in
cultures of m e l a n o m a cells [12]. in addition, pharmacological investigations on isolated rat liver mitochondria revealed that dicarboxylic acids from c8

to c13 are capable of inhibiting cell respiration,
and that they are competitive inhibitors of at least
three mitochondrial oxido-reductases, i.e. n a d h
dehydrogenase,
 xxxg138xxx ,
and
reduced ubiquinone  xxxg569xxx  oxido-reductase
[3].
the present study was instituted in order to establish if the toxic activity of  xxxd269xxx  on cells is
exerted equally in the absence of tyrosinase. for this
purpose, the effect of the diacid has been tested on
cultures of cells other than malignant melanocytes,
viz. on leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines.
in order to study a possible further effect of  xxxd269xxx 
acid on dna synthesis and cell duplication, as has
been suggested [12, 16, 17], normal resting lymphocytes (pbl), pbl induced to synthesize d n a
de novo, and mouse fibroblasts 3t3 cell line were
also studied. it seemed to be of interest to establish
if there was a different effect of  xxxd269xxx  on
leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines compared with the normal cells used in the experiments.
materials and methods

(a'll ctdtures. the following cell lines were used in
the present study: the burkitt lymphoma, epsteinbarr virus-transformed cell lines eb3, j. joye and
raji, and the t lymphoma-derived cell line molt 4
(kind gift of dr. g. aragona, university of rome);
the erytroleukemia cell line k562 (r. herberman,
nci, bethesda. u.s.a.); the mouse fibroblast cell
line balb/c yf3 clone a31-1-1 (t. kakunaga, nci,
bethesda. u.s.a.).
the suspended cell lines were cultured in rpmi
1641,/ (gibco) medium with 10% fetal calf serum
(gibco) and penicillin (100 u/roll and streptomycin
(l(/0!~g/ml) (complete medium). for the experiments the cell lines were seeded at 2-3 × 104 cells/
well in 96 wells plates.
balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts were cultured in complete
mem (gibco) with 10~, fetal calf serum (gibco) and
antibiotics as above [18]. for experimental purposes,
cells at passages 8 to 12 were used. cells were seeded
at concentration of 10~ cells/ml in 60 ml petri dishes.
peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) were isolated
on  xxxd3253xxx  hyparque gradient from normal human
volunteers. they were cultured in complete rpmi
164(i at 2 x 105 cells/well in 96 wells plates (falcon),
in the presence or absence of phytohemoagglutinin
(pha-p wellcome) at 1/~g/ml.
in all the experiments, cells were cultured for 72 hr
in the absence or presence of dicarboxylic acids, and
pulsed for the last 4 hr of cultures with 3h-thymidine
(3ht) (amersham: spec. act. 2ci/mmole) at 5 ,uci/
ml. unpulsed cultures were used for the evaluation
of cell viability bv the trypan blue dye exclusion test.
dicarboxylic acids.  xxxd269xxx  (c9) (fluka, 99%
pure) as its disodium salt at ph 7.2 was used at fnal
concentrations of 10 -~m, 10 2m and 5 × 1 0 2 m .
some cultures were exposed to the same concentrations of the disodium salt of adipic acid (c6
 xxxd2537xxx ). this diacid does not inhibit the
mitochondrial oxido-reductases [3] and its use, therefore, could serve as a control not only for any specific
effect of  xxxd269xxx , but also for any non-specific
osmolar effect, especially at the higher concen-

trations. the osmolarity of c9 and c6 disodium salts
in the cultures medium was tested by cryoscopic
method, and found to be similar.

counted by a beta counter, and the remainder was
analysed by the combined hplc-beta counter
method mentioned above.
results

effects of dicarboxylic acids on cell cultures
the results of the studies on the rate of 3ht
uptake and trypan blue exclusion tests showed that
c9 2na, when added at concentration up to 10 -3 m
had no effect on the proliferative activity and viability
of any of the cells tested. at concentrations 10 -2 m
and 5 x 10 : m the c9 2na had a markedly adverse
effect on the proliferative rate and survival of lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines (figs. 1 and
2). at the same concentrations of c9 the proliferative
rate and survival of resting or pha-stimulated lymphocytes and 3t3 fibroblasts were unaffected (figs.
1 and 2).

with adipic disodium salt, up to 5 x 10 -2 m, there
was no effect on the 3ht uptake and viability of any
of the cells tested. at similar concentrations the
osmolarity of c6 2na was approximately equal to
that of c9 2na.

cell uptake and metabolism of radiolabelled  xxxd269xxx 
acid
the experiments on cellular incorporation of (1-9
]4c) xxxd269xxx  showed that the radiocarbon uptake
varied with the cell type, and was proportional to
the external concentration of the diacid up to 10-~ m
and to the incubation time, peaking at 60 min. the
recovery of added labelled c9 was 88 + 5%.
in table 1 are represented the results of the experiments on the different cell cultures (106cells/ml)
incubated for 60 min with 20/~ci/ml of (1-9 14c)c9
to which 10 -2 m cold  xxxd269xxx  was added in order
to obtain the concentration that proved to be toxic
for the tumor derived cell lines. table 1 shows that
the radiocarbon incorporation was two to three times
higher with leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell
lines than with lymphocytes (p < 0.005), either resting or stimulated, and with 3t3 fibroblasts.
the analysis of the cell extracts showed that about
70% of the total radioactivity was present in the lipid
extracts and 30% in the residual matter. the t l c h p l c - b e t a counter analysis of the chloroform methanol extracts showed that, after 60 min incubation,
nearly 30% of the lipid radioactivity was detectable
in the dicarboxylic acids fraction on the thin layer
plate. the remaining lipid radioactivity was mainly
concentrated in the phospholipid, cholesterol and
triacylglycerol fractions, separated by tlc. as
shown by hplc analysis, in addition to labelled c9,
radioactive dicarboxylic acids catabolites with chain
lengths 2 or 4 carbon atoms shorter than c9 were
detected, thus indicating that a beta-oxidation of the
diacid partly took place (table 2).

intracellular localization o f radiolabelled c9

table 3 shows the results obtained by fractionated
centrifugations of 3t3 fibroblasts cultured in the
presence of radiolabelled c9. it is evident that it was
mainly concentrated in the cytoplasm. the hplcbeta counter analysis of the lipid extracts of the
different cell fractions showed that 20% of the
radiocarbon detected in the cytoplasm was constituted by  xxxd269xxx  p e r se. a small amount of
labelled c9 was also present in the other cell
fractions.
discussion

this study has shown that there was a 50-80%
mortality of lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell
lines exposed to concentrations of  xxxd269xxx  disodium
salt (10 -2 m, 5 x 10 -z m) close to those producing
similar effect on melanoma cells in culture [6, 17, 18].
the diacid, therefore, is not specifically anti-melanocytic, but can affect also lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines, and quite probably it may
be shown to be toxic to other tumor cell lines in the
future. the fact that c6 2na at the same concentrations had no toxic effect proves that c9 effect
is a real specific one, not due to high osmolarity p e r
se.

1657

cell viability as shown by the trypan blue exclusion
tests (figs. 1 and 2).
how might the difference in reaction between the
tumoral-derived cell lines and the normal cells used?
it could be that, as suggested for other tumoral
cells [13], in leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell
lines the mitochondria are deficient in some way that
renders them more susceptible to the damaging effect
of  xxxd269xxx . however, we have no information
on this point. what we wish to emphasize is that,
according to our data, a correlation exists between
the 14c c9 uptake and the toxic effect of  xxxd269xxx 
acid. in fact, we have shown that the amount of
radiocarbon uptake was 2 or 3 times higher in the
lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines than in
resting or stimulated lymphocytes and 3t3 fibroblasts
(table 1). this certainly indicates a higher degree of
permeability of the cell membranes of the tumorderived cell lines to the diacid. in this case it could
be suggested that the cells are faced with an amount
of  xxxd269xxx  exceeding the beta-oxidation capacity
of the mitochondria, an excess therefore being available to inhibit the oxido-reductases of the respiratory
chain. a similar argument could be used to explain
the absence of an effect of dicarboxylic acids upon
normal as compared with hyperactive or malignant
melanocytes in vivo.
