context: adrenocortical carcinoma (acc) is a rare tumor with a poor
prognosis. despite efforts to develop new therapeutic regimens for
metastatic acc, surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. interferons are known to exert tumor-suppressive effects in several types
of human cancer.
design: we evaluated the tumor-suppressive effects of type i interferons (ifn)-␣2b and ifn␤ on the h295 and sw13 human acc cell
lines.
results: as determined by quantitative rt-pcr analysis and immunocytochemistry, h295 and sw13 cells expressed the active type
i ifn receptor ( xxxg1138xxx ) mrna and protein ( xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2c
subunits). both ifn␣2b and ifn␤1a significantly inhibited acc cell
growth in a dose-dependent manner, but the effect of ifn␤1a (ic50 5

drenocortical carcinoma (acc) is a rare tumor with a dismal prognosis (1, 2). complete surgical
resection is currently the only curative therapy for localized
acc (3). when complete resection is not possible, or in
metastatic disease, the treatment of choice is chemotherapy
with  xxxd2656xxx  (2).  xxxd2656xxx , being an adrenolytic compound
(4), has been used in the treatment of patients with acc as
a single agent as well as in combination with other therapies.
overall, a response rate between 20 and 33% has been reported (5). however, treatment with  xxxd2656xxx  is associated
with several side effects, and long-term therapy is indicated
only in case of a clinical response (2). in addition, there are
no conclusive in vivo data showing favorable effects on survival and quality of life in metastatic acc after the treatment
with  xxxd2656xxx , alone or in combination with chemotherapy.
therefore, novel treatment strategies are clearly required for
this carcinoma (6)
in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the efficacy of type
i interferons (ifns) in the treatment of several tumors, alone
or in combination with chemotherapy (7, 8). type i ifns,
such as ifn␣, ifn␤, and ifn␻, interact with the same re-

with that of ifn␣2b (ic50 57 iu/ml, maximal inhibition 35% in h295;
ic50 221 iu/ml, maximal inhibition 60% in sw13). whereas in h295
cells both ifns induced apoptosis and accumulation of the cells in s
phase, the antitumor mechanism in sw13 cells involved cell cycle
arrest only. inhibitors of caspase-3,  xxxg342xxx , and caspase-9 counteracted the apoptosis-inducing effect by ifn␤1a in h295 cells. in
h295 cells, ifn␤1a, but not ifn␣2b, also strongly suppressed the
 xxxg1146xxx  mrna expression, an important growth factor and hallmark
in acc.
conclusions: ifn␤1a is much more potent than ifn␣2b to suppress
acc cell proliferation in vitro by induction of apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest. further studies are required to evaluate the potency of
ifn␤1a to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. (j clin endocrinol metab

ceptor complex [type i ifn receptor ( xxxg1138xxx )], composed by
two subunits, i.e.  xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2 (9, 10). the type i
ifns modulate tumor-suppressive activity through different
mechanisms, including induction of cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis (11). it has been described that type i ifns are able
to down-regulate the expression of  xxxg1146xxx  at the mrna and
protein level in some cancers (12, 13). considering that  xxxg1146xxx 
is highly expressed in more than 90% of the acc and that
this growth factor is involved in adrenal growth and tumorigenesis of acc (14), type i ifns may be of potential interest
in the treatment of acc.
to explore new possibilities of acc treatment, we investigated the in vitro effects and mechanism of action of ifn␣2b
and ifn␤1a on the growth of two established human acc
cell lines, e.g. h295 and sw13.
materials and methods
cell lines and culture conditions
the human acc cell line, nci-h295r, was obtained from the american type culture collection (manassas, va). the sw13 acc cell line
was obtained from ecacc (salisbury, wiltshire, uk) .
the cells were cultured in 75-cm2 culture flasks (corning costar,
amsterdam, the netherlands) at 37 c in a humidified incubator containing 5% co2. the culture medium consisted of a 1:1 mixture of
dmem and f12k medium, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum,
penicillin (1 ⫻ 105 u/liter),  xxxd164xxx  (0.5 mg/liter), and l-glutamine
(2 mmol/liter). cells were harvested with trypsin (0.05%)-edta (0.53

ceeded 95%. media and supplements were obtained from gibco bio-cult
europe (invitrogen, breda, the netherlands).

drugs and reagents
human recombinant ifn␣2b ( xxxd2365xxx   xxxd2862xxx ) was purchased from roche
(almere, the netherlands). human recombinant ifn␤1a was purchased from serono inc. ( xxxd2371xxx ; rockland, ma). human recombinant
ifn␤1b was obtained from schering (mijdrecht, the netherlands).
caspase inhibitors devd-cho, lehd-cho, and ietd-cho were purchased from biosource (brussels, belgium).

quantitative rt-pcr
for the detection of ifn receptors ( xxxg1138xxx -1,  xxxg1138xxx -2b,  xxxg1138xxx -2c)
and  xxxg1146xxx , total rna was isolated using a commercially available kit
(high pure rna isolation kit; roche). cdna synthesis and quantitative
pcr using the taqman gold nuclease assay was performed as described
in detail previously (15). the primer and probe sequences were purchased from biosource. the sequence of the primers  xxxg1138xxx -1,  xxxg1138xxx -2
total,  xxxg1138xxx -2b, and  xxxg1138xxx -2c as well as the concentrations of primers
and probes used in the assay have been described by vitale et al. (16).
the sequences of the  xxxg1146xxx  primers were:  xxxg1146xxx  forward, 5⬘ccaagtccgagagggacgt-3⬘;  xxxg1146xxx  reverse, 5⬘-ttggaagaacttgcccacg-3⬘; and  xxxg1146xxx  probe, 5⬘-fam-accgtgcttccggacaacttccc-tamra-3⬘. dilution curves were constructed for
calculating the pcr efficiency for every primer set. pcr efficiencies
were:  xxxg1138xxx -1, 1.90 ⫾ 0.02;  xxxg1138xxx -2, 1.89 ⫾ 0.03;  xxxg1138xxx -2b, 1.68 ⫾ 0.04;
 xxxg1138xxx -2c, 1.86 ⫾ 0.06; and  xxxg1146xxx , 2.01 ⫾ 0.07. the estimated copy
numbers were obtained according to the method described by swillens
et al. (17). the amount of mrna was normalized to the total amount of
rna.
to exclude genomic dna contamination in the rna, the cdna
reactions were also performed without reverse transcriptase and amplified with each primer pair. to exclude contamination of the pcr
mixtures, the reactions were also performed in the absence of cdna
template in parallel with cdna samples. as a positive control for the
pcr of type i ifn receptors and  xxxg1146xxx , human dna was amplified in
parallel with the cdna samples.

immunocytochemistry
h295 and sw13 cells, cultured on coverslips (invitrogen), were fixed
with acetone (10 min at room temperature) and incubated for 30 min at
room temperature with antibodies to human  xxxg1138xxx -1 (rabbit polyclonal
antibody; santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca) and ifnar2c. finally, a standard streptavidin-biotinylated alkaline phosphatase
detection system (il immunologic, duiven, the netherlands) was used
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations to visualize the
bound antibodies.
the  xxxg1138xxx -2c antibody (monoclonal antibody 27d11, provided by
e.c., berlex biosciences) was generated against the purified  xxxg1138xxx -2c
ectodomain expressed in baculovirus and purified using a flag affinity
column. this method was previously described for the generation of a
monoclonal antibody against the  xxxg1138xxx -1 ectodomain (18). the use and
specificity of the  xxxg1138xxx -2c antibody has been described previously (16,
19). negative controls for the immunohistochemistry included omission
of the primary antibody.

cell proliferation assay
cells were plated in 1 ml of medium in 24-well plates at a density of
105 cells/well for h295 and 5 ⫻ 103 cells/well for sw13. the plates were
placed in a 37 c, 5% co2 incubator. two days later the cell culture
medium was replaced with 1 ml/well medium containing the indicated
concentrations of interferon in quadruplicate. after 3 and 6 d of treatment, the cells were harvested for dna measurement. plates for 6 d
were refreshed after 3 d, and compounds were added again. measurement of total dna contents was performed as previously described (20).

apoptosis assay
apoptosis was evaluated by the analysis of the dna fragmentation.

van koetsveld et al. • interferons in adrenocortical carcinoma

on 24-well plates, cells were incubated at 37 c. after 2 d the cell culture
medium was replaced with 1 ml/well medium containing various concentrations of drugs (ifn␣2b: 0 –1000 iu/ml; ifn␤1a: 0 –100 iu/ml;
ifn␤1b: 0 –100 iu/ml) in quadruplicate. after 1 d of incubation, apoptosis was assessed using a commercially available elisa kit (cell
death detection elisaplus, roche diagnostic gmbh, penzberg, germany). the standard protocol supplied by the manufacturer was used.
apoptosis was expressed as percentage of control, untreated cells.
to evaluate the role of caspases involved in the induction of apoptosis
after ifn␤1a treatment, h295 cells (105 cells/well) were plated in 24-well
plates and after 1 d of incubation; medium was changed by 1 ml of the
medium containing 10 ␮m of different caspase inhibitors: devd-cho
(blocks caspase-3), ietd-cho (blocks  xxxg342xxx ), and lehd-cho (blocks
caspase-9). after 1 d of incubation, ifn␤1a (5 iu/ml), in the absence or
presence of the caspase inhibitors, was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. plates were then collected for detection of
dna fragmentation by elisa, as described above.

cell cycle analysis
cells (2 ⫻ 105 for h295 and 5 ⫻ 105 for sw13) were plated on 12-well
plates. after 1 d the medium was changed with fresh medium (control)
or fresh medium plus ifn␣2b (500 and 1000 iu/ml) or ifn␤1a (50 and
100 iu/ml). after 3 d of incubation (confluency of about 60 –70%), cells
were harvested by gentle trypsinization, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered calcium and magnesium-free saline (pbs) and collected
by centrifugation. cells were resuspended in 200 ␮l pbs and fixed in 70%
ice-cold ethanol, followed by an overnight incubation at ⫺20 c. after
centrifugation, the cells were washed once with pbs and incubated for
30 min at 37 c in pbs containing 40 ␮g/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (sigma
aldrich, zwijndrecht, the netherlands) and 10 ␮g/ml of dnase-free
rnase (sigma aldrich, zwijndrecht, the netherlands). for each tube,
20,000 cells were immediately measured on a facscalibur flow cytometer (becton dickinson, erembodegem, belgium) and analyzed using
cellquest pro software.

statistical analysis
all experiments were carried out at least three times and gave comparable results. for statistical analysis graphpad prism 3.0 (graphpad
software, san diego, ca) was used. the comparative statistical evaluation among groups was performed by anova. when significant differences were found, a comparison between groups was made using the
newman-keuls test. the unpaired student t test was used to analyze the
differences in concentration effect curves and effects in cell cycle modulation between different types of ifn preparations.

results
expression of type i ifn receptor mrnas and proteins in
h295 and sw13 cells

the effect of type i ifns on cells is modulated by a common receptor. we generated specific primers and probes to
determine the expression of  xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2 (total,
short and long form) mrna in h295 and sw13 cells by
quantitative rt-pcr. in both cell lines, the presence of
 xxxg1138xxx -1,  xxxg1138xxx -2 total,  xxxg1138xxx -2b, and  xxxg1138xxx -2c (fig. 1,
upper panel) was detected.  xxxg1138xxx -1 mrna expression, was
approximately three times higher than  xxxg1138xxx -2 total in both
cell lines. among the  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunits,  xxxg1138xxx -2c was the
form expressed at the relatively lowest level.
in h295 and sw13 cells, specific expression of the two
active ifn receptor subunits ( xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2c) was
found by immunocytochemistry (fig. 1). for  xxxg1138xxx -1 as
well as  xxxg1138xxx -2c, staining was observed both in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane (fig. 1, middle panels). no
staining was observed in the negative controls (fig. 1, lower
panels).

effects of two different types of ifn␤ on cell growth
and apoptosis

we first evaluated the effect of two commercially available
ifn␤ preparations on cell proliferation and proapoptotic
activity in h295 cells, e.g. ifn␤1a (serono, amino acid sequence and glycosylation similar to native ifn␤) and ifn␤1b
(schering, one amino acid change and absence of glycosylation, compared with the native ifn␤).
inhibition of cell proliferation by ifn␤1a was significantly
stronger than with ifn␤1b after 6 d of treatment (ic50 9.7 ⫾
2.7 vs. 87.0 ⫾ 3.8 iu/ml, p ⬍ 0.01; maximal inhibitory effect
on cell proliferation 88 ⫾ 7 vs. 51 ⫾ 10%, p ⬍ 0.01, respectively, for ifn␤1a and ifn␤1b). this is shown in fig. 2a.
in h295 cells both types of ifn␤ preparations increased
dna fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. in agreement with the effect on cell proliferation, ifn␤1a was more
powerful than ifn␤1b (ec50 4.0 ⫾ 1.1 iu/ml, vs. ec50 24.9 ⫾
2 iu/ml, respectively, p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 2b). in subsequent
experiments, we therefore decided to use ifn␤1a.
comparison between the effects of ifn␣2b and ifn␤1a on
cell proliferation

after 6 d of incubation, ifn␣2b and ifn␤1a significantly
suppressed the growth of h295 and sw13 cells in a dosedependent manner (fig. 3, upper panels). ifn␤1a was signif-

icantly more potent than ifn␣2b, as determined by both the
ic50 (h295: 5.4 ⫾ 1.3 vs. 157.0 ⫾ 2.3 iu/ml, respectively, p ⬍
0.01; and sw13: 18.1 ⫾ 1.3 vs. 221.1 ⫾ 1.3 iu/ml, respectively,
p ⬍ 0.01) and the maximal inhibition of cell proliferation after
6 d of treatment (h295: 96 ⫾ 7 vs. 35 ⫾ 2%, respectively, p ⬍
0.01; and sw13: 85 ⫾ 7 vs. 60 ⫾ 3%, respectively, p ⬍ 0.01).
after 6 d of incubation, ifn␤1a induced in both cell lines a
statistically significant inhibition of cell growth, already at
very low concentrations (1 iu/ml, p ⬍ 0.01, vs. control).
moreover, the concentration required to obtain the maximal
inhibition of proliferation was 100 iu/ml for ifn␤1a and 10
times higher for ifn␣2b (1000 iu/ml). comparable results
were found by a [3h]thymidine incorporation assay (data not
shown). there was no statistically significant difference between the ic50 values of 3 and 6 d of treatment (dna control
cells on d 3 and 6: 4330 ⫾ 204 and 7257 ⫾ 246 ng/well for
h295, and 1685 ⫾ 36 and 6870 ⫾ 326 ng/well for sw13,
respectively). h295 cells were slightly more sensitive to type
i ifns than sw13 cells in terms of ic50, whereas maximal
inhibition of cell growth by ifn␣2b was highest in sw13
cells.
effects of type i ifn on cortisol secretion

in h295 cells, we did not observe any difference (ic50 or
maximal inhibition) between the inhibitory effects of type i

and on dna content on the other hand. cortisol production,
normalized for dna content, was not significantly changed
by ifn treatment (data not shown). no detectable cortisol
secretion by sw13 was found.
induction of apoptosis by ifn␣2b and ifn␤1a

after 1 d of treatment with ifn␤1a and ifn␣2b, we measured the dna fragmentation to investigate the induction of
apoptosis (fig. 3, lower panels). in h295, a potent dosedependent induction of apoptosis was observed after ifn␤1a
treatment (ec50 5.0 ⫾ 1.4 iu/ml). the maximal increase of
dna fragmentation induced by 100 iu/ml ifn␤1a was
about six times, compared with untreated control cells.
ifn␤1a stimulated apoptosis in h295 cells already at very
low concentrations (1 iu/ml, p ⬍ 0.01). a less effective dosedependent induction of apoptosis was observed after
ifn␣2b treatment of h295 cells (ec50 249 ⫾ 2 iu/ml). the
maximal increase of dna fragmentation by 1000 iu/ml
ifn␣2b was about 2.5 times, compared with the control.
interestingly, dna fragmentation was not observed in sw13
after treatment with ifn␣2b and ifn␤1a. to study the role
of caspases-3, -8, and -9 in the induction of apoptosis by
ifn␤1a in h295 cells, we evaluated whether specific caspase
inhibitors were able to blunt ifn␤-induced dna fragmentation. as shown in fig. 4, the stimulation of apoptosis by
ifn␤1a is completely blocked by devd-cho, a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, whereas it is only partially counteracted by

effects of ifn␣2b and ifn␤1a on cell cycle progression

we also evaluated the effect of treatment with ifn␣2b
(1000 and 500 iu/ml) and ifn␤1a (100 and 10 iu/ml) on cell
cycle distribution after 3 d of incubation (table 1).
both ifns induced a significant and dose-dependent accumulation of cells in the s phase (ifn␣2b 1000 iu/ml and
ifn␤1a 100 iu/ml: p ⬍ 0.001 vs. control in both cell lines;
ifn␣2b 500 iu/ml and ifn␤1a 50 iu/ml: p ⬍ 0.05 vs. control
in h295 and p ⬍ 0.01 vs. control in sw13 cells), whereas there
was no significant change in g1/g0 distribution (table 1).
the accumulation of cells in s phase after treatment with both
ifns was significantly higher in sw13 cells, compared with
h295 cells. in addition, the proportion of cells in the g2/m
phase decreased significantly, compared with control cells in
both cell lines. these data suggest that acc cells exhibit a
prolonged stay in s phase and fail to transit into the g2/m
phase after treatment with type i ifns.
in h295 cells the cell cycle analysis revealed an increase in
cells with subdiploid dna content (sub-g0 phase) after treatment with ifn␤1a (100 iu/ml: p ⬍ 0.001; 50 iu/ml: p ⬍ 0.05)
or high-dose ifn␣2b (1000 iu/ml: p ⬍ 0.05), thereby confirming the induction of apoptosis by ifn␤1a and ifn␣2b,
as previously shown by the dna fragmentation analyses.

fense (11, 12). these cytokines activate a common receptor
complex composed of two subunits:  xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2.
 xxxg1138xxx -1 is considered the signal subunit chain. there are
three forms of  xxxg1138xxx -2, which are differentially spliced
products of the same gene.  xxxg1138xxx -2a, the soluble form, acts
as a regulator of the free ifns (21, 22).  xxxg1138xxx -2b, the short
form, binds type i ifn but does not couple to signal transduction because it lacks the signal transduction tail (23);
 xxxg1138xxx -2c, the long form, constitutes together with the
 xxxg1138xxx -1 subunit the predominant active form of the type i
receptor complex. in the present study, we evaluated tumor
suppressive capability of type i ifns (ifn␣2b, ifn␤1a) in the
human acc cell lines h295 and sw13. first of all, the expression of mrna and protein for the active subunits of type
i ifn receptor ( xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2c) was demonstrated
in h295 and sw13 cells by quantitative rt-pcr and immunocytochemistry, respectively. both ifns showed a dosedependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. the antitumor activity of ifn␤1a was significantly higher, compared
with that of ifn␣2b in both cell lines. this appeared to be
associated with an increased induction of apoptosis in h295

in h295 cells, the transcription of  xxxg1146xxx  gene is modulated
by incubation with ifn␤1a. we observed a potent and dosedependent decrease in the number of copies of  xxxg1146xxx  mrna
after 3 d of treatment with ifn␤1a (fig. 5). in contrast,
ifn␣2b (1000 iu/ml) was unable to modify the expression
of  xxxg1146xxx  gene in h295 cells (data not shown). mrna expression of the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase was not affected by treatment
with ifn␤1a.

cells only and accumulation of cells in s phase in both cell
lines. in addition, the maximal inhibition of sw13 cell growth
by ifn␣2b appeared to be higher than that in h295 cells. this
may be related to the absence of an effect of type i ifn on
apoptosis and the more prominent role of cell cycle inhibition
induced by type i ifns in sw13 cells, compared with h295
cells, as was observed in the present study. the higher sensitivity of both acc cell lines to ifn␤1a may be explained
by differences in the structure of ifn␣ and ifn␤. there is
only 35% sequence identity between both ifns (24, 25), and
ifn␤ has a higher affinity for the type i ifn receptor, compared with ifn␣ (26).
h295 cells were significantly more sensitive to ifn␤1a
treatment than sw13 cells. this could be a consequence of the
ifn-mediated proapoptotic activity in h295 but not in sw13
cells, as shown by the increase in dna fragmentation and
increase in cells in subg0 phase after the treatment with
ifn␤1a or ifn␣2b. because caspases play an important role
in the induction of apoptosis, we evaluated the role of
caspases in the induction of dna fragmentation after
ifn␤1a treatment in h295 cells. in the classical model,
caspases are divided into initiator caspases (such as
 xxxg342xxx , -9) and executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7),
according to their function and sequence of activation. there
are at least two major apoptotic pathways. the first involves
the death receptor or extrinsic pathway that is initiated by
tnf receptor family members that recruit adaptor and signaling molecules to assemble the death-inducing signaling
complex. this complex leads to activation of  xxxg342xxx 
and/or -10. an alternative mitochondrial pathway involves
activation of caspase-9 on recruitment to the mitochondria by
 xxxg569xxx  and apoptosis protease activation factor-1.
more downstream, the initiator caspases lead to the activation of executioner caspase-3, -6, and -7, which in turn cleave
specific proteins resulting in the dna fragmentation (27, 28).
in h295 cells the stimulation of dna fragmentation by
ifn␤1a is completely blocked by a specific inhibitor of
caspase-3, whereas it is only partially counteracted by the use
of specific inhibitors for  xxxg342xxx  and -9. therefore, ifn␤1a
seems to induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and
mitochondrial pathways in acc.
at present, two recombinant ifn␤s (ifn␤1a and ifn␤1b)
are available as registered drugs. ifn␤1a is produced in
mammalian cells, with an amino acid sequence and glycosylation identical with that of natural ifn␤. in contrast,
ifn␤1b is produced in escherichia coli bacteria and is not
glycosylated. furthermore, ifn␤1b has one amino acid sequence different from the native form of human ifn␤. we
observed in h295 cells that the effects of ifn␤1a on cell
proliferation inhibition and stimulation of dna fragmentation were much more potent, compared with ifn␤1b. this
is in agreement with the observation that the absence of
glycosylation in ifn␤1b can reduce the biological activity
(29). because ifn is currently in clinical use for renal cell
carcinoma and in trials for other malignancies, studies comparing the effects of ifn␤ and ifn␣ in tumor cell models
other than acc will help determine whether the potent
cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of ifn␤ are also present in
other tumor models, rather than being restricted to selected
tumor types.

 xxxg1146xxx  is considered to be an important growth factor in
acc. therefore, we also evaluated the effects of ifn␤1a on
 xxxg1146xxx  mrna expression. h295, but not sw13, cells expressed  xxxg1146xxx . in h295 cells,  xxxg1146xxx  mrna was inhibited in
a dose-dependent manner by ifn␤1a after 3 d of incubation.
this effect was not observed after incubation with ifn␣2b.
it is well known that in acc an up-regulation of the  xxxg1146xxx 
system represents a main pathway involved in the pathogenesis through inducing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (30). this could partially explain why only in h295
cells is ifn␤1a able to induce apoptosis.
in conclusion, this is the first study showing that type i
ifns, particularly ifn␤1a, are powerful inhibitors of proliferation of the h295 and sw13 human acc cells. this effect
is correlated with the induction of apoptosis and/or a cell
cycle arrest in the s phase. our findings support the clinical
attractiveness to use ifn␤ in the treatment of acc because
of its ability to inhibit cell proliferation and stimulate apoptosis already at very low concentrations (1–10 iu/ml). in
vivo, 12.3 iu/ml is the maximal ifn␤ serum concentration
reported in healthy subjects after sc administration of this
cytokine (31). in addition, recent studies report on the development of pegylated ifn␤ with improved pharmacokinetic properties, compared with the unmodified protein (32).
finally, an important finding of the present study is that
ifn␤1a potently inhibits the expression of  xxxg1146xxx  at the transcriptional level. further studies using primary acc cultures as well as in vivo studies are required to evaluate these
promising tumor suppressive effects, using ifn␤1a not only
as a single compound but also in combination with the currently used cytostatic drug  xxxd2656xxx .
