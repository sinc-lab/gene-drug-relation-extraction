abstract
we have previously shown the involvement of na + channel as well as n-type and p/q-type ca2 + channels in the oxygen and glucose
deprivation-induced injury in rat cerebrocortical slices. in the present study, we investigated the influence of halothane on the
cerebroprotective effects of a variety of na + and ca2 + channel blockers in rat cerebrocortical slices. the hypoxic injury was attenuated by
na + channel blockers including tetrodotoxin, lidocaine and  xxxd1869xxx , and ca2 + channel blockers, such as verapamil, n-agatoxin iva and nconotoxin gvia. halothane abolished the protective effects of lidocaine,  xxxd1869xxx  and verapamil, all of which block the respective cation
channels in a voltage-dependent manner, without affecting the actions of tetrodotoxin, n-agatoxin iva and n-conotoxin gvia, which reveal
voltage-independent blockade. on the other hand, the  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis estimated from the extracellular  xxxd1274xxx  formation was
elevated during exposure to hypoxia. all channel blockers tested here attenuated hypoxia-evoked  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis. halothane blocked
almost completely these actions of lidocaine and verapamil. moreover, the na + and ca2 + channel blockade by these compounds, as
determined by veratridine- and kcl-stimulated  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis, respectively, was also reversed by halothane. these findings suggest
that an anesthetic agent halothane reversed the na + and ca2 + channel blockade of several voltage-dependent ion channel blockers, leading to
the attenuation of their cerebroprotective actions. therefore, the influence of halothane anesthesia should be taken into consideration for the
evaluation of neuroprotective action of na + and ca2 + channel blockers.

1. introduction
although the cellular mechanisms underlying the ischemic or hypoxic brain damage are not fully understood, the
breakdown of intracellular ca2 + homeostasis and the resultant aberrant rise in intracellular ca2 + is implicated in the
etiology of cerebral ischemia (orrenius et al., 1989; choi,
1992; kristián and siesjö, 1998). several lines of evidence
have demonstrated that voltage-gated na + and ca2 + channels are involved in the elevation of intracellular ca2 +
induced by cerebral ischemia (pratt et al., 1992; leach et
al., 1993; buchan et al., 1994; lysko et al., 1994; rataud et
al., 1994; barone et al., 1995; smith and meldrum, 1995).
during cerebral ischemia, the dysfunction of na + /k +
atpase occurs due to the depletion of atp, which, in turn,
causes an elevation of intracellular na + concentration and

the extracellular k + , thereby causing membrane depolarization and subsequent activation of voltage-gated na + channel
and ca2 + channels. several na + channel blockers including
tetrodotoxin and antiepileptic agents have been reported to
produce a cerebroprotective action both in vivo (mcdonald
and johnston, 1990; leach et al., 1993; lysko et al., 1994)
and in vitro (fern et al., 1993; lynch et al., 1995). in
addition, n-type ca2 + channel blockers such as n-conopeptide  xxxd1315xxx -111 (valentino et al., 1993; buchan et al., 1994)
and sb 201823-a (barone et al., 1995) have been shown to
protect neurons against focal as well as global cerebral
ischemia in rodents.
we have recently reported that the hypoxic injury induced
by a transient exposure of rat cerebrocortical slices to oxygen
and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation is effectively inhibited by a combined treatment with na + channel
blockers and n-type or p/q-type ca2 + channel blockers
(tatsumi et al., 1998; oka et al., 2000b). moreover, these
na + and ca2 + channel blockers attenuate the activation of

 xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos), a ca2 + -activated enzyme,
induced by the hypoxic insult (oka et al., 2000b).
it has been demonstrated that several anaesthetic agents
affect the function of na + channel as well as ca2 + channel
function by interacting directly with such channels (eskinder
et al., 1993; study, 1994; mcdowell et al., 1996; pancrazio,
1996; rehberg et al., 1996). therefore, it seems probable that
the cerebroprotective efficacies of a variety of na + and ca2 +
channel blockers are influenced by such anesthetic agents. to
ascertain this idea, the effect of halothane on the cerebroprotective actions and ion channel blockade by several types of
na + channel and ca2 + channel blockers was investigated in
rat cerebrocortical slices.

2. materials and methods

dehydrogenase (ldh) into the incubation medium. ldh
was determined by an enzymatic assay kit (wako, osaka,
japan). in normoxic group, slices were incubated for 45 min
in krb under continuous bubbling with 95% o2 and 5%
co2 with or without halothane, followed by reoxygenation
for 5 h in normal krb in the absence of halothane.
halothane was passed over krb using a carrier gas of
95% n2 and 5% co2 (in the case of hypoxia), or 95% o2
and 5% co2 (in the case of normoxia) and a halothane
vaporizer (ahv-5, kimura medical instrument, tokyo,
japan). the concentration of halothane (1% at the vaporizer)
was 0.30 f 0.02 mm (mean f s.e.m., n = 3), which was
determined by using a gas chromatograph (gc-15a, shimadzu, kyoto, japan). at the end of experiments, brain
slices were dissolved in 1 ml of 1 m naoh and protein
content was determined by the method of bradford (1976)
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard.

2.1. animals
male 8– 11 weeks old sprague – dawley rats (shimizu
laboratory supplies co., kyoto, japan) were used. rats were
housed in groups of five to six in a room controlled at 21 – 25
jc, 45– 65% with humidity and maintained in an alternating
12-h light/dark cycle (lights automatically on at 8:00 a.m.).
food and water were freely given. experiments were all
carried out in accordance with the guide for the care and use
of laboratory animals written by the japanese pharmacological society.
2.2. hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced tissue injury in rat
cerebrocortical slices
hypoxic tissue injury was induced in rat cerebrocortical
slices, as described previously (tatsumi et al., 1998; oka et
al., 2000b). briefly, after immersing the whole brain in icecold 5% glucose solution for 10 min, the cerebral cortex was
dissected on ice and serial coronal sections of 500-am
thickness were prepared using mcilwain tissue chopper
(mickle laboratory engineering, gomshall, u.k.). then,
the chopped tissue was transferred to a glass dish containing
ice-cold krebs –ringer bicarbonate solution (krb: 118 mm
nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 2.54 mm cacl2, 1.2 mm mgcl2, 1.2
mm kh2po4, 25 mm nahco3 and 11.5 mm d-glucose, ph
7.4), and each slice was gently isolated with forceps. a
piece of slices was transferred to a 24-well culture plate
containing 2 ml krb and preincubated at 37 jc for 1 h
under continuous bubbling with a gas mixture of 95% o2
and 5% co2. after preincubation, the slice was incubated in
glucose-deprived krb at 37 jc for 45 min under continuous bubbling with 95% n2 and 5% co2 in the absence or
presence of halothane, followed by reoxygenation for 5 h in
normal krb in the absence of halothane. the concentration
of halothane was 300 am, which was chosen on the basis
that the aqueous halothane concentration for surgical anesthesia is between 0.21 and 0.35 mm (smith et al., 1981).
tissue damage was assessed by the leakage of lactate

2.3. measurement of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) synthesis in the
extracellular fluids and in slices of the rat cerebral cortex
the no synthesis during exposure of rat cerebrocortical
slices to the oxygen and glucose deprivation was estimated
from  xxxd1274xxx  formation in the extracellular fluids, as
described previously (oka et al., 2000a). briefly, the rat
cerebellum was homogenized with 10 volumes of ice-cold
buffer-a (50 mm tris – hcl containing 1 mm edta, 1 mm
dithiothreitol and 200 am phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)
using polytron (pt-3000, kinematica, littau, switzerland).
after centrifugation at 30,000  g for 30 min, the supernatant
fraction was used for the source of  xxxg1587xxx . the
cerebrocortical slice was exposed for 45 min to 2 ml of
oxygen- and glucose-deprived krb, in which 0.5 mm gtp,
1 mm  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) and 20 al aliquot of the supernatant fraction of rat cerebellum were
included. halothane (300 am) was applied as described
above. the  xxxd1274xxx  produced in the incubation medium
was measured by using the amersham  xxxd1274xxx  enzyme
immunoassay kit.
in another set of experiments where the no synthesis
was evoked by veratridine or kcl stimulation, the cyclic
gmp accumulation in cerebrocortical tissues was measured,
as described previously (oka et al., 1999). in brief, a piece
of brain slices was transferred to a 24-well culture plate
containing 2 ml of krb under continuous gassing with 95%
o2 and 5% co2 and preincubated at 37 jc for 1 h. then,
the slice was incubated with 10 am veratridine or 50 mm
kcl for 20 min in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx , and the
reaction was terminated by addition perchloric acid (final
concentration was 0.2 m). halothane (300 am) was applied
as described above. the slice was homogenized, and the
homogenate was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g for 15 min at
4jc. the resultant supernatant was neutralized with 10%
k2co3, then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g for 15 min at 4jc.
the  xxxd1274xxx  content in the supernatant was determined
as described above.

3. results
3.1. effect of halothane on cerebroprotective actions of
various na+ and ca2+channel blockers against hypoxic
injury in rat cerebrocortical slices
when rat cerebrocortical slices were exposed to oxygen
and glucose deprivation for 45 min followed by reoxygenation for 5 h, a significant increase in ldh leakage was

observed. the na + channel blockers including 1 am tetrodotoxin, 30 am lidocaine and 10 am  xxxd1869xxx  reversed the
hypoxic injury (fig. 1a). halothane (300 am) by itself did
not affect the ldh leakage, while it reversed almost completely the protective actions of lidocaine and  xxxd1869xxx 
without affecting that of tetrodotoxin (fig. 1b). in addition,
the hypoxic injury was attenuated by 10 am verapamil alone
or the combined treatment with n-type ca2 + channel blocker
n-conotoxin gvia (5 am) (regan et al., 1991) and p/q-type
ca2 + channel blocker n-agatoxin iva (0.2 am) (mintz et al.,
1992) (fig. 2a). halothane markedly reversed the protective
action of verapamil, whereas it failed to counteract the
protective action of the combination of n-agatoxin iva
and n-conotoxin gvia (fig. 2b).

after preincubation for 1 h, slices were exposed to the oxygen and glucose
deprivation for 45 min, followed by reoxygenation for 5 h. tetrodotoxin
(ttx; 1 am), lidocaine (lid; 30 am) or  xxxd1869xxx  (dib; 10 am) was
included during both the hypoxic and reoxygenation periods, while
halothane (300 am) was included during the hypoxic period. in normoxia
group, slices were incubated with halothane for 45 min under the normoxic
condition, followed by reoxygenation for 5 h in the absence of halothane.

the no synthesis during exposure of rat cerebrocortical
slices to oxygen and glucose deprivation for 45 min was
estimated from  xxxd1274xxx  formation in the incubation
medium after addition of soluble fraction of rat cerebellum
(as the source of  xxxg1587xxx ), 0.5 mm gtp and 1
mm  xxxd2388xxx  to the medium, since the tissue  xxxd1274xxx 
content was reduced during hypoxia due to the severe
depletion of gtp, a substrate for  xxxg1587xxx  (oka
et al., 2000b). the deduced no synthesis was markedly
elevated during hypoxia (fig. 3a). the na + channel blockers and ca2 + channel blockers tested in the present study all
significantly attenuated the oxygen and glucose deprivationinduced enhancement of no synthesis. as in the case of the

the no synthesis during exposure to hypoxia was estimated from cyclic

as shown in fig. 4a, veratridine (10 am) stimulated the
no synthesis estimated from the tissue  xxxd1274xxx  accumulation, which was completely blocked by 1 am tetrodotoxin, 30 am lidocaine or 10 am  xxxd1869xxx . halothane (300
am) by itself caused a moderate but not significant reduction in the veratridine-evoked no synthesis in rat cerebrocortical slices. the inhibitory effect of tetrodotoxin was not
influenced by halothane at all, whereas the inhibitory
actions of lidocaine and  xxxd1869xxx  were completely reversed
by halothane (fig. 4b). on the other hand, the no synthesis
evoked by 50 mm kcl was significantly blocked by nconotoxin gvia, n-agatoxin iva or verapamil (fig. 5a).
halothane (300 am) by itself did not affect the kcl-evoked
no synthesis in rat cerebrocortical slices, while it completely reversed the inhibitory action of verapamil without
affecting those of n-conotoxin gvia or n-agatoxin iva
(fig. 5b).

lidocaine or verapamil was added to the incubation medium in the absence

veratridine (10 am) or kcl (50 mm) for 20 min, and estimated from tissue
 xxxd1274xxx  accumulation. the ordinate represents the percentage of cyclic
gmp accumulation of each basal value. in a, basal  xxxd1274xxx  levels were
1.4 f 0.5 pmol/mg protein/20 min in the absence of halothane and
0.7 f 0.1 pmol/mg protein/20 min in the presence of halothane, whereas in
b, those values were 1.4 f 0.1 pmol/mg protein/20 min in the absence of
halothane and 0.7 f 0.1 pmol/mg protein/20 min in the presence of
halothane. each point represents the mean f s.e.m. of five experiments.

bitory action of lidocaine or verapamil (up to 100 or 30 am,
respectively) was observed, when determined in the presence of 300 am halothane.

4. discussion
in the present study, the oxygen and glucose deprivationinduced injury was suppressed by a single treatment with
na + channel blockers such as tetrodotoxin,  xxxd1869xxx  and
lidocaine, and ca2 + channel blocker including verapamil,
and the combined treatment with n-type ca2 + channel
blocker n-conotoxin gvia and p/q-type ca2 + channel
blocker n-agatoxin iva. it is unlikely that the protective
action of verapamil is due to the block of l-type ca2 +
channel, since another l-type ca2 + channel blocker, nifedipine, is not effective in our hypoxic injury model (tatsumi
et al., 1998; oka et al., 2000b). it has been demonstrated
that verapamil blocks multiple types of ca2 + channels
including l-type, n-type and p/q-type ca2 + channels in a
voltage- and use-dependent fashion (cai et al., 1997;
furukawa et al., 1997). in our previous works (tatsumi et
al., 1998; oka et al., 2000b), the hypoxic injury was not
effectively attenuated by either n-conotoxin gvia or nagatoxin iva, alone, but significantly inhibited by the
combination of these peptides. consistently, in the present
study, the hypoxic injury was significantly reversed by the
combined treatment with both peptides. taken together, the

179

cerebroprotective effect of verapamil may result from the
blockade of both n-type and p/q-type ca2 + channels.
on the other hand, the cerebroprotective effects of
 xxxd1869xxx , lidocaine and verapamil were dramatically reduced by halothane, whereas the effects of tetrodotoxin,
and the combination of n-conotoxin gvia and n-agatoxin
iva were not affected at all by halothane.
we have recently shown that the enhanced formation of
no is implicated in the pathogenesis of the oxygen and
glucose deprivation-induced injury, based on the facts that
several no synthase inhibitors ng-nitro-l-arginine and ngmonomethyl-l-arginine, and a no scavenger sodium 2-(4carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5- tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3oxide (carboxy-ptio) effectively inhibit the hypoxic injury
(oka et al., 2000a,b). moreover, the no synthesis, as
estimated from the formation of  xxxd1274xxx  in the extracellular fluids after addition of gtp and cerebellar soluble
fraction as the source of  xxxg1587xxx , was remarkably
enhanced during hypoxia (oka et al., 2000a,b,c). also, in
the present study, a marked elevation of no synthesis was
observed during hypoxia. moreover, the oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced enhancement of no synthesis was
significantly reversed by a variety of na + and ca2 + channel
blockers. therefore, it is suggested that the cerebroprotective actions of na + and ca2 + channel blockers observed in
the present study may be due at least in part to the inhibition
of no synthesis during hypoxia. it was noteworthy that the
inhibitory effects of  xxxd1869xxx , lidocaine and verapamil, but
not those of tetrodotoxin, n-conotoxin gvia and n-agatoxin iva, were almost completely abolished by halothane.
consistently, halothane reversed the cation channel blocking
actions of  xxxd1869xxx , lidocaine and verapamil without affecting those of tetrodotoxin, n-conotoxin gvia and n-agatoxin iva, as determined by the blockade of veratridine- or
kcl-stimulated no synthesis.
it has been demonstrated that several local anesthetic
agents including  xxxd1869xxx  and lidocaine block na + channel
in a voltage- and use-dependent manner (catterall, 1987).
on the other hand, tetrodotoxin, whose site of action is
localized near the extracellular pore of the na + channel
moiety, blocks na + channel in a voltage-independent fashion (catterall, 1987). the site of action of verapamil in
blocking voltage-dependently the ca2 + channel has been
shown to be located within the sixth transmembrane segment (s6) in domain iv of the ca2 + channel moiety (hering
et al., 1996), which was quite similar to the site of action of
the local anesthetics on na + channel moiety. in contrast, the
possible sites of actions of n-agatoxin and n-conotoxin are
considered to exist on the extracellular region of s3 – s4
linker of domain iv (bourinet et al., 1999) and s5 – s6
linker in domain iii of the ca2 + channel (ellinor et al.,
1994), respectively, and the ca2 + channel block by these
peptide blockers is not dependent on membrane potential.
therefore, it is notable that halothane attenuated the actions
of only voltage-dependent na+ as well as ca2 + channel
blockers. it is suggested that halothane interferes with the

180

m. oka et al. / european journal of pharmacology 452 (2002) 175–181

association or interaction of several voltage-dependent na +
and ca2 + channel blockers with their transmembrane sites
located on the s6 region in domain iv of the channel moiety.
the concentration of halothane used in the present study
was 300 am, which was chosen on the basis that the
aqueous halothane concentration for surgical anesthesia is
between 0.21 and 0.35 mm (smith et al., 1981). it has been
demonstrated that voltage-gated na + and ca2 + channels
are possible candidates to be affected by halothane, although
the precise mode of action is unclear. it has also recently
been shown that halothane at submillimolar concentrations
blocks na + channels in several tissues (eskinder et al., 1993;
study, 1994; mcdowell et al., 1996; pancrazio, 1996) and in
cells transfected with rat brain na + channel (rehberg et al.,
1996). in addition, halothane inhibits the veratridine-evoked
22
na + influx (ic50 = 1.1 mm) into synaptosomes of rat
cerebral cortex, and specifically antagonized [3h]batracotoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 2 of the na +
channel (ic50 = 0.53 mm) without affecting [3h]saxitoxin
binding to neurotoxin binding site 1 of the na + channel
(ratnakumari and hemmings, 1998). besides the action on
na + channel, electrophysiological studies have shown that
halothane (0.59 mm) inhibits the channel function of p/q-,
l-, n- and r-types of ca2 + channels expressed in xenopus
oocytes (kamatchi et al., 1999). moreover, halothane displaces the binding of dihydropyridine derivative [3h]pn200100 in membranes of rat ventricular myocytes (kanaya et al.,
1998). however, in our present study, the no synthesis
induced by 10 am veratridine or 50 mm kcl was not
affected by halothane, although the former reaction was
moderately but not significantly reduced by halothane. we
do not know the precise reason for such inconsistency. the
differences in the concentration of halothane, indices of ion
channel function or tissue preparations may result in such
inconsistency between our data and those reported by
others. however, halothane at a higher concentration (3
mm) indeed markedly reduced both the veratridine-stimulated and kcl-evoked no synthesis in the present study
(data not shown).
in conclusion, the oxygen and glucose deprivationinduced injury in rat cerebrocortical slices was inhibited
by a variety of na + and ca2 + channel blockers. halothane
reversed the cerebroprotective actions of some of these ion
channel blockers including local anesthetics and verapamil,
all of which are known to block ion channels in a voltagedependent manner. the inhibitory effects of such ion
channel blocker as local anesthetics and verapamil on the
enhancement of no synthesis during hypoxic insult were
also attenuated by halothane. moreover, the na + and ca2 +
channel blocking actions of these ion channel blockers, as
determined by veratridine- and kcl-evoked no synthesis,
respectively, were reversed by halothane. these findings
suggest that the cerebroprotective action of voltage-dependent na + and ca2 + channels blockers is attenuated by some
anaesthetic agents such as halothane. therefore, the influence of anesthesia should be considered in the evaluation of

the neuroprotective action of such cation channel blockers
using animal models of cerebral ischemia.
