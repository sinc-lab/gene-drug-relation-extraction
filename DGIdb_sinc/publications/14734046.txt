abstract
increased na+/ca2+-exchanger (ncx) and altered b-adrenoceptor (bar) responses are observed in failing human heart. to determine the
possible interaction between these changes, we investigated the effect of ncx overexpression on responses to  xxxd2401xxx  in adult rat
ventricular myocytes. responses to  xxxd2401xxx  were largely mediated through the  xxxg91xxx  in control myocytes. adenovirally-mediated
overexpression of ncx, at levels, which did not alter basal contraction of myocytes, markedly depressed the  xxxd2401xxx  concentration–
response curve. responses to  xxxd2401xxx  could be restored to normal by  xxxg92xxx  blockade, suggesting a  xxxg92xxx -mediated inhibition of  xxxg91xxx 
signalling. pertussis toxin normalised  xxxd2401xxx  responses in ncx cells, indicating that  xxxg92xxx  effects were mediated by gi. negativeinotropic effects of high concentrations of ici 118,551, previously shown to be due to  xxxg92xxx –gi coupling, were increased in ncx cells. we
conclude that ncx upregulation can markedly alter the consequences of bar stimulation and that this may contribute to the alterations in
bar response seen in failing human heart.

1. introduction
in failing human myocardium there have been some reports of increased protein levels of the na+/ca2+-exchanger
(ncx), a sarcolemmal protein which is the main mechanism
for ca2+ extrusion from the myocyte during diastole [1].
from studies in a model of heart failure, it was later suggested that increased ncx might be dysrhythmogenic due to
an interaction with residual b-adrenoceptor (bar) stimulation [2]. to investigate the interaction between raised ncx
and bar stimulation, we have used adenoviral transfection
in isolated rat myocytes. the rat was chosen because of the
presence of b1- and b2ars in ventricular myocytes [3,4],
since both subtypes are present and active on myocytes from
failing human heart [5]. there is evidence for a difference in
coupling between the two subtypes [4,6], as well as a differential downregulation in heart failure, with the  xxxg91xxx  lost and

 xxxg92xxx  preserved in number [7]. we now show that there is a
dramatic alteration in the balance of effect between the two
subtypes in ncx-overexpressing myocytes, and that the minor  xxxg92xxx  component is able to suppress almost completely
the effects of  xxxg91xxx  stimulation.
2. methods
2.1. isolation and culture of myocytes
ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult male sprague–dawley rats and cultured for 48 h as previously described [8] in the presence or absence of ad.ncx-green
fluorescent protein (gfp) or ad.gfp at multiplicities of
infection (moi) of 100 and 1000 active virus particles per
myocyte. the viruses were constructed in the laboratory of
dr. roger hajjar (cardiovascular research centre, harvard
medical school, boston, ma, usa) [9]. pertussis toxin
(ptx) 1.5 µg/ml, where present, was added at the same time
as the virus. after 48 h, myocytes were resuspended and
washed free of culture medium. myocytes were then per-

fused with krebs–henseleit solution as previously described
[10] (37 °c, 2 mmol/l ca2+) and stimulated at 0.5 hz. detection of gfp was taken as an indication of infection and cells
were selected for study on that basis. contraction amplitude
was measured using the ionoptix system. cumulative concentration–response curves to  xxxd2401xxx  were constructed in the presence and absence of the selective blockers
ici 118,551 ( xxxg92xxx : 50 nmol/l) and cgp 20712a ( xxxg91xxx :
300 nmol/l).  xxxd2401xxx  was added until spontaneous contractile activity was observed, or the concentration 10 µmol/l
was attained.
2.2. western blotting
myocytes from two 12-well plates were combined and the
procedure carried out as before [9]. freshly isolated myocytes, and myocytes cultured for 48 h with or without
ad.ncx-gfp, were frozen in liquid n2 and stored at –80 °c.
after thawing at room temperature in phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs), cells were centrifuged twice at 500 g for 1 min
and resuspended in pbs. myocytes were lysed in 15%  xxxd3215xxx , 100 mmol/l tris–hcl (ph 6.8),
40 mmol/l phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (pmsf) and
10 mmol/l edta, with vortexing every 5 min for 25 min plus
trituration through a fine needle. after centrifugation at
10,000g the supernatant was stored at –80 °c. protein concentrations were determined using bicinchonic acid (bca
protein assay kit, pierce, rockford, il, usa) followed by
standard western blotting techniques. membranes were exposed to primary mouse monoclonal antibodies for ncx
(affinity bioreagents inc., golden, co, usa). binding of
secondary antibodies was detected using the ecl system
(amersham).
2.3. statistical methods
results are shown as mean ± s.e.m., except where indicated. comparisons of two groups were made by paired or
unpaired t-test, and of three groups by one-way anova with
bonferroni post hoc test. concentration values were log
transformed before testing. comparison of complete concentration–response curves was performed using the curve fitting function in graphpad prism v4. individual sigmoid
curves were first fitted independently, then the program fitted
the points from both curves together to give a global fit. the
goodness of fit was compared between the two methods by an
f-test, and if the global fit was significantly worse then the
null hypothesis, that the curves were statistically indistinguishable, could be rejected.

3. results
after 48-h culture with ad.ncx-gfp, >75% of myocytes
expressed gfp and levels of protein showed a modest but
significant increase (22.3 ± 0.3%, n = 4, p < 0.05,

mean ± s.e.m.) (fig. 1). ncx activity was assessed by rapid
application of caffeine to the cells, and the inward current at
the sarcolemmal membrane (generated by removal of ca2+
released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr)) was measured. the continuous presence of caffeine prevented sr
ca2+ accumulation. the kinetics of the current showed that
the amount of ca2+ released was similar between control and
ncx myocytes (con: 1.03 ± 0.2 pc/pf, n = 6; ncx:
1.34 ± 0.2 pc/pf, n = 6) indicating that sr stores were not
different in the two groups. however, ca2+ was removed
more rapidly in ncx than control, uninfected cells indicating an increase in ncx activity (fig. 2). we have previously
shown that viral infection alone has no effect on ncx activity [9]. basal contraction amplitude in 2 mmol/l ca2+ was not
significantly altered in the ncx-overexpressing myocytes
used in the subsequent experiments (fig. 2), nor was there
any alteration in resting cytosolic ca2+ levels (measured as
described previously [9]) (indo-1 ratio, con: 0.80 ± 0.08,
mean ± s.d., n = 84; ncx: 0.80 ± 0.09, n = 69). however,
further raising ad.ncx-gfp levels to 1000 moi did produce a significant decrease in amplitude (1.80 ± 0.55% shortening, n = 5, p < 0.01).
3.1. concentration–response curves to  xxxd2401xxx 
concentration–response curves to  xxxd2401xxx  were severely depressed in ncx (f-test, p < 0.001), with the maximum increase in contraction amplitude reduced from
6.09 ± 0.63% shortening (n = 6) to 2.96 ± 0.90% (n = 5,
p < 0.02) (fig. 3). the concentration for half-maximal effect
(ec50) was increased from 1.2 nm (con) to 9.0 nm in ncx

individual fits.

118,551 (a  xxxg92xxx -blocker: 50 nmol/l). the presence of the
b1-blocker shifted the concentration–response curve in control myocytes by just under 2 log units (ec50: 80 nmol/l,
fig. 4a) but did not alter the magnitude of the depression of
bar response in ncx compared to control myocytes
(p < 0.001, f-test).
the presence of the b2-blocker markedly enhanced the
response to  xxxd2401xxx  in ncx myocytes, restoring it to
levels close to those in control myocytes (con: p > 0.1,
f-test) (fig. 4b). concentration–response curves in control
myocytes were unaffected by ici 118,551 (p = 0.07 vs. con,
fig. 3), confirming our previous findings [3] that b2ars do
not contribute to the contractile response to  xxxd2401xxx  in
normal rat myocytes when b1ars are active.

3.3. ptx treatment reverses the effect of ncx on bar
responses
to determine the role of the inhibitory g-protein (s), gi, in
the effect of overexpressed ncx, ptx was included in the
culture medium with ad.ncx-gfp. inhibition of gi restored
 xxxd2401xxx  concentration–response curves to levels
greater than those in control myocytes (p = 0.0013, fig. 5a).
in a separate series of experiments, uninfected cells were
cultured in the presence of ptx, and a small leftward shift in
the curve was observed (–log ec50 con: 8.5 ± 0.1, n = 13;
con + ptx: 9.0 ± 0.1, n = 7, p < 0.05) without an increase in
maximum amplitude (fig. 5b).

p < 0.001 vs. before ici 118,551.

3.4. direct negative-inotropic effect of  xxxg92xxx –gi coupling
is increased in ncx cells
we have previously shown that high concentrations of
b-blockers, such as ici 118,551, can produce a direct
negative-inotropic effect through a  xxxg92xxx –gi pathway [6].
this effect is usually evident only when gi is overexpressed,
or when b2ars numbers are increased and gi has subsequently upregulated [6]. however, a significant negativeinotropic effect of 1 µmol/l ici 118,551 was observed in
myocytes overexpressing ncx (fig. 6). the effect varied
substantially between cells, with 3/17 cells showing little
response to ici 118,551 while contraction in others was
depressed by as much as 70% of the original amplitude. the
depression of contraction was reversible within 10 min, demonstrating that it was not simply a time-dependent decrease
in contractility. there was even a slight but significant rebound effect, with amplitudes after ici 118,551 reaching
higher values than before; this effect was not seen in control
cells.
4. discussion

(1.5 µg/ml for 48 h) (ncx + ptx: n = 10, solid symbols). matched series of
uninfected, untreated myocytes (con: n = 8, open symbols) and ad.ncxgfp-infected untreated myocytes (ncx: n = 2). basal shortening was
subtracted (con: 4.6 ± 0.6% shortening; ncx: 8.6%; ncx + ptx:
5.3 ± 0.9%). global curve fits were significantly worse than individual fits
for ncx + ptx and con (f-test, p = 0.0013). (b) concentration–response
curves for  xxxd2401xxx  in control (uninfected) cells treated with ptx
(1.5 µg/ml for 48 h). untreated (con: n = 14, open symbols) and ptx treated
(con + ptx: n = 7, solid symbols). basal shortening (1 mm ca2+) was
subtracted (con: 2.5 ± 0.3% shortening; ncx: 2.4 ± 0.4% shortening).
global curve fit was significantly worse than individual fits (f-test,
p < 0.001).

the main finding of this study is the dramatic loss of
response to bar stimulation in myocytes overexpressing
ncx. the degree of ncx overexpression was modest, with
an increase of protein of only 22% and an acceleration of
ncx-mediated ca2+ removal by 28%, and was insufficient to
significantly alter basal contraction amplitude, resting cytosolic ca2+ or sr ca2+ levels. however, in ncx cells the
increase in contraction amplitude with  xxxd2401xxx  was
virtually abolished at lower concentrations, and was less than
half that of controls even when  xxxd2401xxx  concentrations
were increased 100-fold over those producing a maximum in
control cells.
responses to  xxxd2401xxx  in ncx cells could be restored
to normal after application of low concentrations of ici

118,551, in the range at which this compound is a specific
blocker of the  xxxg92xxx  coupled to gs/adenylyl cyclase. in
control cells the  xxxg92xxx  has a minor positive inotropic effect
when the  xxxg91xxx  are blocked (see fig. 4a) but does not contribute to the main increase in contraction mediated by  xxxd2401xxx , since curves are not shifted by  xxxg92xxx  blockade
[3]. the response to  xxxd2401xxx  through b1- plus b2ars in
ncx cells is equal to or less than the response through  xxxg92xxx 
alone in controls, and is fully restored by  xxxg92xxx  blockade.
this implies that the minor  xxxg92xxx  component (5–20% total
receptor number, [3,11–13]) is able to suppress the effect of
the predominant  xxxg91xxx  when ncx levels are raised. b2armediated suppression of  xxxg91xxx  effects has a precedent in the
literature, having been observed in the transgenic mouse with
overexpression of the human  xxxg92xxx  [14,15]. in these animals
the  xxxg92xxx  effect appears to be secondary to upregulation of
gi, since inhibition of gi using ptx restores  xxxd2401xxx 
responsiveness [16,17]. in the present study ptx also restored the contractile response to  xxxd2401xxx , indicating
that gi was involved in the suppression of bar-mediated
contraction in ncx-treated myocytes.
we have previously reported that high concentrations of
certain b-blockers, including ici 118,551, can have direct
negative inotropic effects on cardiac myocytes in the absence
of catecholamines [6]. this was again mediated through
 xxxg92xxx –gi coupling and was evident under conditions where
either gi was increased (failing human heart, rat myocytes
overexpressing gia2) or where  xxxg92xxx  were overexpressed
with subsequent upregulation of gi. although apparently
similar to inverse agonism, the negative-inotropic effects
occurred in the absence of raised basal contraction and were
independent of intracellular  xxxd1773xxx . in the present study
we implicate ncx in the mechanism of reduction of contraction by 1 µm ici 118,551, since the negative-inotropic effect,
minimal in untreated cells, was enhanced in ncx myocytes
and reached levels similar to those previously observed in
gia2-overexpressing cells [6].
increase in ncx activity by overexpression of the protein
produces per se a decrease in contraction amplitude in rat
myocytes, at least at lower ca2+ concentrations [18]. in the
present study there was a slight but not significant depressant
effect of ncx on basal contraction at 100 moi and this
became more pronounced at 1000 moi, with contraction
amplitude decreased by 75%. the mechanism of the decreased contractility has been shown to relate to decreased
sr ca2+ stores, probably because of preferential removal of
ca2+ through ncx during diastole [9,19]. we suggest that
stimulation through the  xxxg92xxx –gi pathway increases the activity of ncx and this in a similar manner decreases basal
amplitude. the mechanism of this stimulation is at present
unknown. coupling of ncx to gi has been reported in ewe
heart [20], where adenosine increased vmax for ncx in
membrane preparations without an effect on km. adenosine
acts at gi-coupled a1 receptors to suppress bar-mediated
positive inotropic responses [21]. the precise mechanism
was undefined, but antagonism by caffeine suggested a cyclic

47

amp-related effect. direct membrane delimited coupling
between gi and ncx is also a possibility, or an intermediate
pathway, such as  xxxg1368xxx , which is negatively inotropic in rat myocytes [22].
does the direct depression when  xxxg92xxx –gi is stimulated
by ici 118,551 relate to the loss of response to  xxxd2401xxx 
in ncx cells?  xxxd2401xxx , although a full agonist at the
 xxxg92xxx –gs complex, can also be a partial agonist at  xxxg92xxx –gi.
this is evident in the reports of negative inotropism of high
concentrations of  xxxd2401xxx  in the tgb2 mice when
 xxxg91xxx  are blocked [23,24] and in previous reports suggesting
dual coupling of the  xxxg92xxx  through both gs and gi after
 xxxd2401xxx  stimulation [17,25]. inhibition of gi has been
shown to enhance the positive inotropic response to  xxxg92xxx 
stimulation in adult rat myocytes, consistent with removal of
a  xxxg92xxx –gi-mediated inhibitory component [26]. the
present results suggest that, when ncx is overexpressed, the
 xxxd2401xxx -stimulated  xxxg92xxx –gi negative-inotropic effect
is sufficient to suppress both the  xxxg92xxx –gs and  xxxg91xxx –gs
mediated increases in contraction.
how does this relate to the degree of bar desensitisation
in myocytes from failing human heart, where ncx and gi
levels are raised and the relative contribution of b2ars is
increased due to selective loss of b1ars [1,27,28]? concentration–response curves for  xxxd2401xxx  are depressed, although this could be explained simply by the loss of bar
number and increase of bar kinase [28,29]. ptx fully
reverses bar desensitisation in failing human myocytes,
consistent with a role for a gi-mediated inhibitory pathway
[30], but exposure to the selective  xxxg92xxx  antagonist, ici
118,551, does not restore  xxxd2401xxx  responses to normal
in these cells [5], in contrast to the findings in the present
study. however, we previously noted that  xxxg91xxx -dependent
effects of  xxxd2401xxx  (i.e. a shift in the  xxxd2401xxx  concentration–response curve by the  xxxg91xxx -blocker cgp
20712a) were not observed until the  xxxg92xxx -blocker was
present [5]. this was interpreted as a primary dependence on
 xxxg92xxx  stimulation for the positive inotropic effect of  xxxd2401xxx  in failing human myocytes. in the light of the present
findings, we suggest that it could also represent an effect of
b2ars to produce simultaneous activation via gs/camp and
inhibition via gi/ncx, with the ncx component also suppressing  xxxg91xxx -mediated stimulation. removal of the  xxxg92xxx 
component with the blocker then unmasks the conventional
 xxxg91xxx -mediated contractile response.
we conclude that ncx upregulation, which has been
observed in failing human heart, has the potential to markedly alter the consequences of bar stimulation. a novel
interaction between the  xxxg92xxx  and ncx has been observed.
