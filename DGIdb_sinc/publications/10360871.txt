preparation of barbiturate optical isomers and their

effects on gaba, receptors

background: barbiturate anesthetics are optically active
and usually exist in two mirror-image enantiomeric forms.
their stereoselective effects in mammals are well known, but
remarkably few data are available concerning their effects on
anesthetic targets in vitro. this is in part because of the lack
of availability of pure barbiturate enantiomers. such in vitro
data could be used to test the relevance of putative molecular
targets.

methods: a high-performance liquid chromatography tech-
nique using a permethylated b-cyclodextrin column was used to
separate the optical isomers of three barbiturates in preparative
quantities. the effects of the isomers on gaba-induced currents
in stably transfected mouse fibroblast cells were investigated
using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.

results: highly purified optical isomers of  xxxd2279xxx , pen-
tobarbital, and thiopental were prepared, and their effects were
studied on a y- xxxd2177xxx  type a receptor of defined
subunit composition. for each of the three barbiturates, both
enantiomers potentiated y- xxxd2177xxx —induced currents
at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, with the s-enan-
tiomer being more potent than the r-enantiomer by a factor of
between 1.7 and 3.5. the degree of stereoselectivity did not vary
greatly with anesthetic concentration.

conclusions: the rank order and degree of stereoselectivity
that we have observed for the enantiomers of  xxxd2279xxx ,
pentobarbital, and thiopental acting on the y- xxxd2177xxx 
type a receptor are entirely consistent with this receptor play-
ing a central role in the anesthetic actions of barbiturates. (key
words: chiral chromatography; intravenous anesthetics; pro-

it has been appreciated for more than 30 yr that
optical isomers of barbiturates can have different an-
esthetic activities in mammals. early studies!” showed
clear differences in anesthetic potencies between the
optical isomers of barbiturates that contained a cyclo-
hexenyl ring (such as  xxxd2279xxx ), although the ab-
solute configurations were not known. the crucial
1on
optically pure enantiomers of a variety of barbiturates,
including those that have been most widely used clin-
ically and experimentally (thiopental and pentobarbi-
tal). the availability of pure barbiturate enantiomers
led to a series of papers’ * that investigated their
pharmacological activities; in particular, these studies
showed that s(—) isomers of thiopental and pentobar-
bital were significantly (approximately twofold) more
potent than the r(+) isomers in causing a loss of
righting reflex in mice (see ref. 9 for a review on the
structural specificity of barbiturates).

although these investigations with animals were fol-
lowed by a number of in vitro studies on possible anes-
thetic targets, there have been surprisingly few attempts
to use the optical isomers of barbiturates as a means of
defining their most likely sites of action in the central
nervous system. for example, despite its clinical impor-
tance, we are not aware of a single study on the effects
of the enantiomers of thiopental on a putative molecular
target for general anesthetics. this is no doubt at least in
part because of the fact that the synthesis of the barbi-
turate enantiomers is not trivial, and they have not been
available commercially. an alternative to the chemical
synthesis of the enantiomers is their separation using

chiral chromatography, and recent advances in the use

cherey-nagel, duren, germany) can be used to prepare
milligram quantities of the enantiomers of  xxxd2279xxx ,

animals as a guide to identifying which molecular targets
are likely to be most relevant to their pharmacological

materials and methods

preparation of barbiturate enantiomers

we prepared milligram quantities of the enantiomers
of  xxxd2279xxx , pentobarbital, and thiopental using
high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). we
used a column (250 mm long, 10 mm id, about 20 ml
capacity) prepared by macherey-nagel, which consisted
of a stationary chiral phase of permethylated b-cyclodex-
trin covalently bonded to silica (5 jm particle size,
nucleodex b-pm). the column was temperature-con-
trolled and held at 20-22°c. the mobile phase was a
volatile buffer solution composed of 65% (v/v) methanol
(hplc hipersolv grade,  xxxg257xxx  laboratory supplies, poole,
dorset, uk) and 35% (v/v) 0.1% or 1.0% triethylammo-
nium acetate (hplc grade, applied biosystems, foster
city, ca) in water titrated to either ph 7.0 or ph 4.0
with acetic acid. the mobile phase was filtered through
a 0.2-~m nylon 66 filter (anachem, luton, bedfordshire.
uk). the racemic barbiturates (sigma chemical, poole,
dorset, uk) were obtained as sodium salts, in the cases
of pentobarbital and thiopental, or as the free acid in the
case of  xxxd2279xxx . further details of the hplc proce-
dures are given in table 1. barbiturate solutions were
filtered prior to injection with a 0.22-um millex-gv4
filter (millipore, bedford, ma), and the flow rate through
the column was 2 ml/min. after column separation, the
enantiomers were dried by either a rotary or centrifugal
evaporator. both thiopental enantiomers, as well as the
r(+ )-pentobarbital, required a second column purifica-
tion to achieve the highest levels of optical purity (=
99.0%).

preparation and culture of pa3 cells

mouse fibroblast l cells stably transfected!° with bo-
vine a@,b,y2, subunits of the gaba, receptor were
kindly supplied by p. whiting (merck sharp and dohme
research laboratories, harlow, essex, uk). these pa3
cells were grown for electrophysiological experiments
using methods exactly as described previously.'”

recording technique for pa3 cells

inward currents, caused by the efflux of chloride ions,
evoked by the application of gaba to pa3 cells were
recorded using the standard whole-cell patch-clamp
technique with an axopatch 200 amplifier (axon instru-
ments, foster city,
cated from thin-walled filamented borosilicate glass
capillary tubes (gc1s50tf,
ments, reading, berkshire, uk) using a two-stage pull

easily formed “gigaohm” seals with the cells. once the
whole-cell configuration was established, the cells were
voltage-clamped at —40 mv. during recording, the pa3
cells were bathed in an extracellular solution containing
124 mm nacl, 5 mm kci, 2 mm  xxxg2125xxx , 1 mm mgcl, 5 mm
hepes, and 11 mm d-glucose (titrated to ph 7.4 with
naoh). membrane currents were filtered at 50 hz (—3
db; eight-pole bessel filter, fe-301-sf, fylde electronic
laboratories, preston, lancashire, uk). membrane volt-
ages were compensated for series resistance by more
than 80% for all recordings. all drugs were applied rap-
idly via a double-barrelled glass capillary tube as de-
scribed previously.'* experiments were performed at
room temperature (20 -23°c).

experiments were carried out using a low concen-
tration (1 um) of gaba, which under control condi-
tions induced a nondesensitizing current with a mag-
nitude of approximately 1% of the maximal current.
pairs of stable gaba-activated control currents were
recorded before and after application of the anesthetic
and averaged to give a control response. at concen-
trations at which the barbiturate was found to have a
significant effect on the baseline current, it was pre-
applied before the application of gaba (in order to
correct for direct barbiturate-gated currents by estab-
lishing an accurate baseline for gaba-dependent po-
tentiation). only in the case of thiopental at concen-
trations greater than or equal to 25 um was this found
to be necessary, and even then the direct effects were
very small—for example, 40 jm thiopental activated a
current only 13 + 2% (n = 7) of that induced by 1 pm
gaba. in all other cases, gaba and the barbiturate
were coapplied. the order of application of the iso-
mers was varied from cell to cell. unless other-
wise stated, all chemicals were obtained from sigma

separation of the barbiturate enantiomers

the hplc protocol described in the materials and
methods section gave close to baseline separation for
the three pairs of anesthetic barbiturates we studied,
and milligram quantities of the enantiomers could be
prepared relatively easily. typical column separations
are shown in figure 2. for the cases of  xxxd2279xxx 
and pentobarbital the preparation of the enantiomers
was particularly straightforward because of the excel-
lent separation and relatively short column retention
times. for the thiopental enantiomers, the appearance
of a contaminating peak (peak 1 in fig. 2c) and the
longer retention times made the separation slightly
more difficult. the first small peak, which consists of
about 3-4% of the total material, is almost certainly
the structural isomer 5-ethyl-5-(1-ethylpropyl)-2-thio-
barbituric acid.'? for all three of the barbiturates, the
enantiomers could be prepared to high purities (99.0 -
99.8%). the identities of the major peaks in the chro-
matograms could be readily determined by measuring
the optical rotations with a polarimeter. values for the
specific optical rotations (degrees of rotation of plane-
polarized light at a concentration of 1 g/em* and for a
pathlength of 10 cm) we observed for the enantiomers

roughly the same extent (940 + 50% and 1,200 + 140%,

the concentration-dependence of the potentiation for all
six enantiomers over the range of concentrations that is
likely to be of pharmacological relevance. because the

mum precision in estimating the degree of stereoselec-
tivity for the barbiturate enantiomers was obtained by
measuring the ratios of potentiations for individual cells
exposed to fixed concentrations of both enantiomers
(fig. 5). the degree of stereoselectivity (defined as the
ratio of the potentiations of the s and the r isomers) was,
averaged over the concentration ranges investigated, 2.3
for  xxxd2279xxx , 3.2 for pentobarbital, and 1.8 for thio-
pental, although for pentobarbital there was a small but
statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in stereose-
lectivity with increasing concentration (see fig. 5b).

obarbital, pentobarbital, and thiopental suggests that this
preparative hplc method could be readily extended to
other barbiturates. although the separation on an ana-

have not often been achieved. ''’'* however, the separa-

scale.

before considering the effects of the barbiturate enan-
tiomers on the gaba, receptor, or indeed on any other
putative anesthetic target, it is important to make some
reference to those concentrations that are pharmacolog-
ically relevant. for the cases of thiopental and pentobar-
bital, good estimates are available for the concentrations
that are needed to achieve a variety of anesthetic end-
points in mammals. of most relevance to surgical anes-
thesia are the ec;, concentrations required to abolish a
response to a painful stimulus, and these concentrations
(in free aqueous solution) are 25 pm for racemic thio-
pental and 50 jm for racemic pentobarbital.'> no di-
rectly equivalent estimate exists, however, for racemic
 xxxd2279xxx . nonetheless, for many general anesthetics
there appears to be a reasonable agreement between the
ec. concentrations needed to abolish a painful stimulus
in mammals, and those for a loss of righting reflex in
tadpoles.'>?°-** for  xxxd2279xxx , this latter value is
about 100 um,~ so we might take this concentration to

22

anesthesiology, v 90, no 6, jun 1999

 

be a reasonable benchmark, in lieu of more definitive
measurements in mammals.

as can be seen from the data in figure 4, at the relevant
ec, concentrations for general anesthesia, all six of the
barbiturate enantiomers caused substantial potentiations
of the current induced by a low concentration of gaba.
it is well known that barbiturates act at the gaba,
receptor by increasing the apparent affinity of gaba for
its receptor (see, for example, ref. 25), so it is only fair to
point out that our experimental protocol (using a low
concentration of agonist) is designed to maximize the
anesthetic effect. in addition, our protocol differs from
the physiologic situation at inhibitory gabaergic syn-
apses, where high agonist concentrations are encoun-
tered for very short times and the anesthetic effect of
increasing apparent affinity for gaba manifests itself as
a prolongation of inhibitory postsynaptic current (see,
for example, ref. 26). it therefore seems likely that the
potentiations we have observed with our protocol at
pharmacologically relevant concentrations of barbitu-
rates would translate into substantial increases in charge
transfer at inhibitory gabaergic synapses.

for each of the barbiturates, the $ isomer was more
effective than the r isomer by a factor of roughly two or
three (see fig. 5). this may reflect differences in potency,
efficacy, or both. the larger effects observed with the $
isomers of  xxxd2279xxx  and pentobarbital are consistent
with the results of the earliest studies,*”** as well as the
comprehensive analysis on the allosteric effects of bar-
biturates performed by olsen et al? surprisingly, how-
ever, no data exist, at least to our knowledge, on the
effects of the thiopental enantiomers on gaba, receptor
function. the data in figures 4c and 5c show that, as
with the other barbiturates, the $ isomer of thiopental is
also the more effective, again by a factor of roughly two.

how can these i vitro data be compared with po-
tency measurements of barbiturate enantiomers in mam-
mals? the most obvious problem that must be addressed
is the extent to which the pharmacokinetics of drug
delivery and elimination affect the observed stereoselec-
tivity in animal potencies. this is a complex issue, and it
is difficult to be definitive, particularly for drugs that are
almost entirely eliminated by hepatic biotransformation.
nonetheless, although redistribution and metabolism
greatly affect the duration of anesthesia (/e., sleeping
times), they should have relatively smaller effects on the
rapid loss of righting reflex following a bolus injection.
the main pharmacokinetic factors that affect this mea-
surement of anesthetic potency are the rate of transfer
across the blood-brain barrier, which is largely deter-

an overall assessment of the importance of these factors
on the observed stereoselectivity of animal potencies
can be made by comparing the plasma and brain con-
centrations of the enantiomers achieved following an
equal bolus dose. the available evidence strongly sug-
gests that under these conditions the concentrations of
the s and r isomers of a particular barbiturate achieve
very similar concentrations in the brain,?*°~*° yet pro-
duce different anesthetic responses.

so, as a first approximation, we can interpret the
stereoselectivity observed for the barbiturates acting on
animals to cause a loss of righting reflex as reflecting
their intrinsic effectiveness at their relevant target sites.
reliable values of the relative potencies of the s(—) and
r(+) isomers of thiopental?” and pentobarbital”® in
causing a loss of righting reflex in mice are available and

should provide an important guide as to which molecu-

shown in figures 4 and 5 supports the already strong

to reasonable levels of pentobarbital.*” barbiturate enan-
tiomers should be extremely useful in assessing the pos-
sible roles of these and other putative targets in barbitu-

study.

what can we learn from our results about the molec-

rates? although it is possible, in principle, that the bar-
biturate enantiomers could partition stereoselectively
into lipid bilayers, when this has been studied with other
anesthetics (isoflurane and etomidate) no measurable
stereoselectivity has been observed.'”*°*! the degree

in previous studies on the interactions of isoflurane’

found that the degree of stereoselectivity increased sig-
nificantly with anesthetic concentration. we interpreted
this as reflecting a change in the structure of the anes-
thetic binding sites, as increasing anesthetic concentra-
tions favored an allosteric conformational change in the
receptor (this conformational change can safely be pre-
sumed to occur in order to account for the increased
apparent affinity of the receptor for its agonist). for the
barbiturate enantiomers, a slightly different picture
emerges because the data in figure 5 show that there is
little change in the degree of stereoselectivity with an-
esthetic concentration over the range of concentrations

tested (for pentobarbital the change is significant, but

small). if this interpretation is correct, then one must
conclude that the binding environment of the barbitu-

rates remains unchanged during the allosteric conforma-
tional change, which in turn suggests that the barbitu-
rates bind to a site distinct from that of either isoflurane
or etomidate. however, we do not consider this to bea

' particularly strong argument, and more direct informa-
_ tion on the extent to which anesthetics occupy unique

or overlapping sites is likely to come from mutagenesis
studies.**** furthermore, it must not be forgotten that
the chiral effects we have observed may be caused partly
by gating effects, such as stereoselective differences in
the degree to which bound barbiturates favor opening of
the gaba-complexed receptor channel. whatever the
details, there seems to be little doubt that the barbitu-
rates exert their effects by binding to specific sites on

_ the gaba, receptor, and that these effects play a major

role in the anesthetic properties of these agents.
