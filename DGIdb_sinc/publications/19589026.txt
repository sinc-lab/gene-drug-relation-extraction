the myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) encompass a heterogeneous group of malignant
hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, frequent
karyotypic abnormalities and significant risk for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (aml).
the prognosis of patients with intermediate- or high-risk mds is very poor. this is due to the fact
that standard therapeutic options are largely palliative. neither autologous stem cell transplantation
(sct) nor chemotherapeutic regimens have been shown to prolong survival in patients with mds.
allogeneic sct, while potentially curative, is only available to a selected group of patients and is
associated with high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, which constitute the majority of
patients with mds. hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes has been invoked as an
important pathogenetic mechanism in mds. the pyrimidine nucleoside analog  xxxd253xxx , which
inhibits dna methyltransferases, has recently become the first therapeutic to prolong survival in
patients with mds, thus changing the natural history of these malignancies. the activity of
 xxxd253xxx  in mds has spurred the development of combinations of this agent with other
epigenetic modifiers for the treatment of mds and aml.

myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) refers to a
group of heterogeneous clonal disorders of the
hematopoietic stem cells characterized by deregulation of apoptosis, dysplastic changes in hematopoietic precursors, peripheral blood cytopenias
and increased proclivity to transformation to
acute myeloid leukemia (aml). the age-adjusted
incidence of mds is 3.3 cases per 100,000 people, and this rate appears to be increasing [1] .
the prognosis of patients with intermediate- or
high-risk mds remains very poor owing to the
disappointing activity of standard therapeutic
strategies currently available. typically, mds
is refractory to standard chemotherapy-based
therapies, particularly in those with therapyrelated mds [2] . neither autologous stem cell
transplantation (sct) nor chemotherapeutic
regimens have been shown to prolong survival.
the access to allogeneic sct, currently the
only known curative modality, is restricted
to approximately 8% of patients with mds,
owing to advanced age, concomitant comorbidities and/or donor availability [2] . traditionally,
most patients with mds are treated with supportive measures, such as lineage-specific colony-­
stimulating factors, transfusion of blood products
and iron-chelating agents.

recurrent chromosomal abnormalities are
present in 40–70% of patients at diagnosis
and in 95% of patients with treatment-related
mds [3] , often resulting in complex karyotypes
frequently involving -5/del(5q), +8, and/or
-7/del(7q) [3] . partial or complete chromosomal
losses are common in mds [3] ; however, loss
of gene function is frequently the result of
epigenetic transcriptional silencing through
methylation of the cytosine residues contained
within the dinucleotide sequence cytosinephosphate diesterguanine (cpg) in gene promoters and/or post-translational deacetylation
of histones [4] . hypermethylation of cpg-rich
‘islands’ (areas of increased density of cpgs)
within promoter regions of tumor-suppressor
genes are hallmarks of malignancies, resulting in decreased gene expression [5] . as this
is a heritable event, mds cells may increase
the number of tumor-suppressor genes that
are hypermethylated as the disease progresses,
resulting in higher levels of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. the discovery that epigenetic modulation of gene
transcription plays an important pathogenic
role in the development of mds has led to the
development of novel therapeutic approaches.

reversibility of epigenetic changes through pharmacologic
manipulation with dna-hypomethylating agents, such as
 xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ;  xxxd253xxx ®, celgene corporation, nj,
usa) or  xxxd1823xxx  (5-aza-2´-deoxyazacitidine;  xxxd1823xxx ®, mgi
pharma, mn, usa), has rendered encouraging results that have
changed the therapeutic paradigm in mds. these results have
laid the groundwork for the development of active epigenetic
combinatorial approaches for mds.
currently, the treatment of patients with mds is guided by
the prognosis of the disease as predicted by the international
prognostic scoring system (ipss), a staging model based on the
presence of cytopenias due to the disease, the associated chromosomal abnormalities accompanying the mds diagnosis and
the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow. mds classified as
either low risk or intermediate-1 risk can initially be observed
in order to gain an appreciation of the tempo of the disease.
once treatment is warranted, growth factor support can be used,
initially followed by treatment with a hypomethylating agent
thereafter. when mds is classified as either intermediate-2 risk
or high risk, a suitable allogeneic stem cell donor should be sought
if the patient is a candidate for intensive chemotherapy and a
hypomethylating agent, such as  xxxd253xxx  or  xxxd1823xxx , is recommended as the initial therapeutic agent [6] .  xxxd253xxx  was
the first hypomethylating agent approved by the us fda for the
treatment of mds [7,8] .  xxxd253xxx  is currently being investigated
in an off-label fashion for the treatment of other hematologic
malignancies, such as aml.
 xxxd253xxx 

the chemotherapeutic agent  xxxd253xxx  is a nucleoside analogue
that inhibits dna methyltransferase activity, resulting in global
and gene-specific dna hypomethylation [8] . while structurally
related to  xxxd1823xxx ,  xxxd253xxx  is first incorporated into rna
and requires the activity of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
to be incorporated into dna and to exert its hypomethylating effect [9] . in the late 1960s and early 1970s,  xxxd253xxx 
was developed in a series of phase i and ii trials as a classic
cytotoxic and was found to be effective for the treatment of

myeloid malignancies. most of these studies involved relapsed
patients with aml [10–20] , but also, in some cases, previously
untreated aml [21] . in these studies,  xxxd253xxx  was administered at doses ranging from 100 to 750 mg/m² and the response
rates ranged from 0 to 58%. it is important to emphasize that
in many of the studies,  xxxd253xxx  was administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, which makes it
difficult to ascertain the individual contribution of  xxxd253xxx 
to the observed responses, and the  xxxd253xxx  dose employed
was much higher than that currently approved for the treatment
of mds (75 mg/m 2 /day for 7 days). at those higher doses,
 xxxd253xxx  was associated with frequent serious dose-limiting
toxicities, which hampered the potential application of this
agent as an antileukemic agent. importantly,  xxxd253xxx  has
a dose-dependent dual mechanism of action, inducing cytotoxicity, probably resulting from the incorporation of the drug
into rna and/or dna, at high concentrations and causing
hypomethylation at lower doses through depletion of dna
methyltransferases. the initial responses and favorable toxicity
profile observed with the use of low-dose  xxxd253xxx  led to large
randomized trials that resulted in the approval of this agent for
the treatment of mds [7] .
chemistry

the first report on the synthesis of  xxxd253xxx  was published
in 1964 [22] .  xxxd253xxx  is designated chemically as 4-aminob-d-ribofuranosyl-s-triazin-2(1h)-one. its empirical formula
is c8h12n4o5 (figure 1) . the molecular weight of  xxxd253xxx  is
244.2 g/mol [23] .  xxxd253xxx  is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog
that differs from cytosine only by the presence of nitrogen in the
c5-position, which appears to be crucial for the induction of a
hypomethylating effect [24] .
pharmacodynamics

 xxxd253xxx  is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. much
like other cytosine nucleoside analogs,  xxxd253xxx  enters cells
by means of the nucleoside transporters hent1 and hent2.
however, unlike  xxxd1823xxx  or  xxxd1790xxx ,  xxxd253xxx  does not
require  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ) to
be phosphorylated to its active form.
instead,  xxxd253xxx  relies on the activity
of uridine–cytidine kinase (uck) upon
entrance into the cell [25] . the fact that
 xxxd1823xxx  uses  xxxg611xxx  for initial phosphorylation while  xxxd253xxx  uses uck and
that  xxxg611xxx  deficiency is the major known
mechanism of resistance to  xxxd1823xxx  and
other cytosine nucleoside analogues [26,27]
is of clinical importance, as  xxxd1823xxx 
resistance related to  xxxg611xxx  deficiency does
not result in resistance to  xxxd253xxx ,
which can be exploited therapeutically.
the main mode of  xxxd253xxx  antineoplastic activity is through its inhibition of
dna methylation, which ultimately leads
expert rev. anticancer ther. 9(7), (2009)

 xxxd253xxx  for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome

to cytotoxicity of abnormal hematopoietic cells. dna methyl­
ation is dependent on continued expression of dna methyltransferases. dna methylation is catalyzed primarily by three
dna methyltransferases, known as dnmt1,  xxxg645xxx  and
dnmt3b [28,29] . in cancer cells, cpg island hypermethylation
is highly dependent on the continuous expression of dnmt1.
inhibition of the expression of dna methyltransferases results in
decreased dna methylation in newly divided cells, which leads
to reactivation of gene expression in hypomethylated cells [30] .
 xxxd253xxx  accomplishes this effect by forming covalent complexes with all dna methyltransferases and targeting them for
degradation [31] . this process of hypo­methylation preferentially
affects rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow. in fact, perhaps the main limitation of  xxxd253xxx  and, by extension, other
nucleoside analogues, is the requirement for dna incorporation
and active dna synthesis, which obviously hampers its activity
in slowly proliferating cells [32] . thus,  xxxd253xxx  may exert its
effect on malignant clones populating the bone marrow to a more
significant degree than on nondividing cells [23] , which potentially
include leukemia stem cells.
currently available data appear to support the notion that
 xxxd253xxx  exerts its antileukemic activity in vivo through an
epigenetic effect that leads to the clearance of leukemic clones.
although  xxxd253xxx  has been shown to induce terminal differentiation in cancer cell lines in association with upregulation
of tumor-suppressor genes [33] , an unresolved question is the
mechanism whereby the leukemic cells are actually eliminated,
although this probably involves a combination of processes, such
as induction of senescence, differentiation and apoptosis [34] .

drug profile

deamination by  xxxg400xxx  followed by opening of the
ring structure [36] . the excretion of  xxxd253xxx  and its metabolites
is primarily through urinary elimination [23] .
a pilot pharmacokinetic study of  xxxd253xxx  in dogs has been
reported recently [37] . this study showed that oral  xxxd253xxx  was
rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 67%, similar
to the 71% observed with subcutaneous dosing of  xxxd253xxx .
similar plasma concentrations of  xxxd253xxx  were achieved in dogs
given a single oral dose of  xxxd253xxx  16 mg/m2 compared with a
single subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m2 administered to humans.
a 14‑day toxicology study evaluated the oral doses of 0.2, 0.4 and
0.8 mg/kg/day. the oral maximum tolerated dose (mtd) was
found to be 0.2 mg/kg/day administered consecutively for 14 days
followed by a 21‑day recovery period, for a cumulative mtd of
2.8 mg/kg for the 14-day dosing regimen, similar to that seen with
intravenous dosing (2.75 mg/kg over 5 days) [37] . a pilot pharmacokinetic study of  xxxd253xxx  in patients with mds, aml or solid
tumors has shown that the tmax of  xxxd253xxx  administered orally
occurred after a mean time of 1.5 h (range: 1–2 h) in patients
who received a dose of 80 mg (table 1) [38] . of note, the tmax for a
subcutaneous dose of 135 mg is 0.5 h [35] . computer simulations
revealed that the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd253xxx  at doses
of up to 600 mg remained below that reported with subcutaneous
 xxxd253xxx  administered at 75 mg/m2 /day [38] .
although in vivo drug–drug interaction studies are yet to be
conducted, in vitro studies using cultured human hepatocytes
indicate that treatment with  xxxd253xxx  at clinically relevant
concentrations does not induce cyp1a2, 2c19 or 3a4/5.7 [39] .
clinical efficacy

pharmacokinetics & metabolism

phase i studies

the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd253xxx  in mds were reported
by marcucci et al. in a randomized study of six patients who
received a single dose of 75 mg/m² either subcutaneously or
intravenously [35] . a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 28 days
were permitted between treatments. this study proved the excellent
bioavailability of  xxxd253xxx  administered through the subcutaneous route with auc values within 89% of those measured
following intravenous administration. in addition, following
subcutaneous dosing of  xxxd253xxx , the peak plasma concentration of 750 ± 403 ng/ml was achieved after 0.5 h with a mean
half-life of 41 min. the mean volume of distribution following
intravenous dosing was 76 l [35] .  xxxd253xxx  metabolism requires

saiki et al. conducted the first large trial of  xxxd253xxx  in
154 patients with all types of relapsed leukemia [14] .  xxxd253xxx 
was administered at five different intravenous schedules ranging
from 150 to 750 mg/m2. the response rate was 9.2%, including
a complete response (cr) rate of 7.5%. notably, higher remission
rates were observed among patients treated at the lower doses [14] .
these results led to the development of studies using low-dose
 xxxd253xxx  for patients with mds. in a subsequent phase i trial,
15 patients with mds received  xxxd253xxx  administered as a
continuous infusion for 14 days at doses ranging from 10 to
35 mg/m/day [40] . in total, 13 patients completed therapy as
intended, most of them receiving 16.5 mg/m2 /day, and three out

of 13 patients achieved a partial response (pr).  xxxd253xxx  was
well tolerated with mild-to-moderate myelosuppression being a
common side effect [40] .
as mentioned earlier, a pilot pharmacokinetic study of oral
 xxxd253xxx  has been conducted in four patients (one with metastatic thymic carcinoid, one with prostate cancer, one with aml
and one with mds secondary to successfully treated aml) who
received single doses of this agent, one at 60 mg and three at
80 mg [38] . orally administered  xxxd253xxx  demonstrated a notable
pharmacokinetic profile in the absence of any serious azacitidineinduced serious side effects during the 10 ± 3 days post-dose
observation period. a phase i study of oral  xxxd253xxx  is currently
ongoing to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of this agent.

phase ii study (calgb 8921)  xxxd253xxx  75 mg/m 2 /day was
administered subcutaneously as continuous infusion for the first
7 days of a 28-day cycle to 70 patients with mds [43] . the
reported overall response rate was 40%, with 17% achieving
cr and 23% achieving hi [42].
a recent report has disclosed the results of an ongoing randomized community-based open-label phase ii study in which
three different schedules of  xxxd253xxx  that avoid weekend dosing
were evaluated:
• 5-2-2: 75 mg/m2 /day subcutaneously for 5 days, followed by
2 days without treatment, then 75 mg/m2 /day for 2 days;
• 5-2-5: 50 mg/m2 /day subcutaneously for 5 days, followed by
2 days without treatment, then 50 mg/m2 /day for 5 days;
• 5: 75 mg/m2 /day subcutaneously for 5 days.

phase ii studies

the first phase i/ii trial of  xxxd253xxx  75 mg/m 2 /day as continuous infusion for the first 7 days of a 28‑day cycle was conducted by the cancer and leukemia group b (calgb) 8421
in 48 patients with mds [41] . the overall response rate in 46
assessable patients using the international working group (iwg)
response criteria was 44% (table 2) [42] . of these, 15% had cr, 2%
had pr and 27% achieved hematologic improvement (hi) [42] .
patients who did not respond after 4 months were discontinued
from the study. an important observation in this study was the
fact that the best response to  xxxd253xxx  was observed after a
mean of 3.8 cycles (range: 2–11), suggesting that this hypomethylating agent requires multiple doses to yield maximum
efficacy. the median overall survival for the whole cohort was
13.3 months and responses were maintained for a median of
14.7 months. myelosuppression was reported in 33% of patients.
the most frequent nonhematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting in 63% of patients and diarrhea in 30% [42] . in a subsequent

in all three schedules,  xxxd253xxx  was administered every
4 weeks for six cycles. a total of 151 patients were eligible and
were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis. most patients
enrolled were french–american–british (fab) lower risk
(63%) or refractory anemia with excess blasts (raeb; 30%).
all three alternative regimens resulted in comparable outcomes
in terms of hi (ranging from 44 to 56% of patients with major
or minor hi) and transfusion independence. the median duration of trans­f usion independence was 473 days and 387 days
in the 5-2-2 and 5-2-5 arms, whereas that was not reached for
the 5 arm. the absence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia pretreatment, as well as lower transfusion requirements (≤2
units/56 days), predicted higher transfusion-independence rates
during  xxxd253xxx  treatment. likewise, no significant differences were observed regarding tolerability and safety. all three
arms were well tolerated, although fewer adverse events were
reported on the 5 arm. neutropenia (38%), anemia (29%) and

 xxxd253xxx  for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome

thrombocytopenia (25%) were the most frequently reported
hematologic side effects. the most frequent nonhematologic side
effects were fatigue (56%), nausea (55%) and injection-site reactions (55%). it is important to mention that although all three
schedules evaluated in this study showed significant activity,
none of them were demonstrated to be superior to the currently
approved dosing schedule in this patient population primarily
involving patients with lower risk mds [44] .
a recently reported phase ii study investigated  xxxd253xxx  therapy as a maintenance agent in patients with mds or aml who
achieved cr after induction chemotherapy. a total of 60 patients
were enrolled, including 62% of them with a diagnosis of aml
following mds and 38% with intermediate-2- or high-risk mds.
after a median follow-up of 11.5 months (range: 1–52), 24 (40%)
patients achieved cr following induction and 23 of these patients
began maintenance  xxxd253xxx  therapy. the median duration of
response to maintenance treatment was 13.5 months (range: 2–49
or more), and the median overall survival from study initiation was 20 months (range: 4–52 or more). four (17%) of the
23 patients retained cr for more than 2 years [45] .
phase iii studies

based on data reported in phase ii studies utilizing subcutaneous schedules of  xxxd253xxx , a randomized phase iii crossover
study was conducted by the calgb comparing  xxxd253xxx 
versus supportive care (calgb 9221) [46] .  xxxd253xxx  was
administered subcutaneously at 75 mg/m 2 /day for 7 days every
28 days to 99 patients, while 92 patients were randomized to
receive best supportive care [46] . patients in the supportive-care
arm whose disease worsened were allowed to crossover to the
 xxxd253xxx  arm. the dose of  xxxd253xxx  was increased in 33% of
patients who demonstrated no benefit by day 57. responses were
observed in 60% of patients receiving  xxxd253xxx , including 7%
cr, 16% pr and 37% hi. by contrast, only 5% of patients in
the supportive-care arm achieved hi (p < 0.001). trilineage
responses were observed in 23% of patients receiving  xxxd253xxx .
importantly, when the responses obtained in this study were
reanalyzed using the iwg criteria for response, the cr rate
increased to 10%, with a pr rate of 1% and a hi rate of 36%
(table 2) [42] . the median number of cycles to reach a response
was three, with 90% of responders achieving a response by cycle
six. responding patients received three additional courses after
cr, whereas those responders with no cr continued therapy
until cr or progression. the median duration of response was
15 months and the median time to leukemic transformation
or death was 21 months for  xxxd253xxx  versus 13 months for
supportive care (p = 0.007). transformation to aml was
documented in 15% of patients receiving  xxxd253xxx  and in
38% receiving supportive care (p = 0.001) [46] . furthermore,
the quality-of-life was superior among patients who received
 xxxd253xxx .  xxxd253xxx  only showed a trend towards improved
median survival (20 vs 14 months; p = 0.10) [46] . however, a
landmark ana­lysis after 6 months, eliminating the confounding
effect of early crossover to  xxxd253xxx , showed median survival
of an additional 18 months for  xxxd253xxx  and 11 months for

drug profile

supportive care (p = 0.03). these results led to the approval of
 xxxd253xxx  by the us fda for the treatment of patients with
mds [47] .
in a separate study involving patients with mds enrolled in
the nci compassionate use program of  xxxd253xxx  who were
anemic and/or thrombocytopenic, this agent was administered
at a dose of 75 mg/m2 /day for 7 days in 28‑day cycles [48] . a total
of 48 patients enrolled between 1996 and 2001 were evaluable
for response after having received at least 1 cycle of  xxxd253xxx .
in total, 18 (39%) of the 46 transfusion-dependent patients
became transfusion independent and the median duration of
response was 7 months with three patients continuing beyond
2 years [48] . similar to the study conducted by the calgb
group [46] , hematologic toxicity was mild and consisted of
thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, whereas extramedullary toxicity was rare and consisted of pneumonia, arthralgia, diarrhea
and injection-site reactions. overall, treatment-related mortality
was less than 1% [46,48] .
in a recently published phase iii international, multicenter trial,
patients with higher risk mds (ipss intermediate-2 or high risk)
and fab-defined raeb, raeb in transformation or chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml) were randomized to receive
either  xxxd253xxx  (administered subcutaneously at 75 mg/m2/day
for 7 days every 28 days) or conventional care, which consisted
of either best supportive care, low-dose  xxxd1790xxx , or intensive
chemotherapy, as determined by study investigators prior to participant randomization (table 3) [49] . a total of 358 patients were
enrolled at 79 sites, of whom 179 were randomized to receive
 xxxd253xxx . therapy with  xxxd253xxx  was given for a median of
nine cycles. after a median follow-up of 21.1 months, the overall
survival was 24.5 months (9.9 to not reached) in the  xxxd253xxx 
group compared with 15 months (5.6–24.1) in the conventionalcare group (hr: 0.58; 95% ci: 0.43–0.77; p = 0.0001). overall
survival was better for  xxxd253xxx  than conventional care in all
the cytogenetic subgroups on the ipss. in addition, the median
time to aml transformation was 17.8 months in the  xxxd253xxx 
group compared with 11.5 months in the conventional-care group
(p < 0.0001) [49] . time to disease progression, relapse after complete or partial remission, and death were significantly longer in
the  xxxd253xxx  group (median: 14.1 months) than in the conventional-care group (14.1 vs 8.8 months; p = 0.047). the most
common grade 3–4 events were peripheral blood cytopenias for
all treatments. the most common nonhematological adverse event
in the  xxxd253xxx  group was injection-site reactions. in summary,
this study showed for the first time that a hypomethylating agent,
 xxxd253xxx , prolongs survival and decreases the risk of transformation to aml in patients with high-risk mds compared with
­conventional therapies.
it was recently reported that prolonged treatment with  xxxd253xxx  for patients with high-risk mds may improve response
to the agent. when compared with a conventional-care regimen,  xxxd253xxx  75 mg/m2 /day administered subcutaneously for
7 days of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity resulted in a median of three cycles necessary
for first response. by six cycles of treatment, 81% of patients had

achieved a first response and, interestingly, an additional 9% of
patients eventually gained a first response to  xxxd253xxx  by cycle
nine. furthermore, although the first response to  xxxd253xxx  was
the best response for over half of the patients treated, a median
of four additional cycles of  xxxd253xxx  improved response to
the agent in an additional 43% of patients, suggesting that prolonged treatment with  xxxd253xxx  may maximize response to
the agent [50] .
combination studies

the synergistic effects of hypomethylating agents, such as
 xxxd253xxx , with other epigenetic therapies, such as histone
deacetylase inhibitors (hdacs), prompted the development
of combined epigenetic approaches to the treatment of patients
with mds.

drug profile

the combination of various dosing regimens of  xxxd253xxx  followed by a 7-day infusion of  xxxd2918xxx  (375 mg/kg/day
intravenously as a continuous infusion) in patients with mds
and aml was tested in a phase i trial [51] . in total, 11 out of 29
evaluable patients responded, including four crs and one pr.
responses correlated with reversed methylation of p15 or cdh-1
promoter genes during the first cycle of therapy and induction of
acetylation of histones h3 and h4 [51] .
a phase i study combining subcutaneous  xxxd253xxx  at 30,
40 or 50 mg/m 2 for 10 days in combination with the hdac
inhibitor  xxxd2001xxx  at doses ranging from 2 to 8 mg/m2 administered on days 3 and 10 of 28-day cycles was recently conducted
in 31 patients with mds and aml [52] . dose-limiting toxicity
(dlt) occurred in four patients treated with  xxxd2001xxx  8 mg/m2
( xxxd253xxx  40 and 50 mg/m2) in the form of laryngeal edema
(n = 2), delayed neutrophil recovery over 21 days (n = 1) and
asthenia (n = 1). in total, 12 (44%) out of 27 evaluable patients
responded, including two crs and four prs. h4 acetylation
increased in 28 (96%) out of 29 patients. the relative contribution of  xxxd2001xxx  to these responses is under examination in an
ongoing eastern cooperative oncology group study that randomizes patients to  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd2001xxx  versus a comparable
dose of  xxxd253xxx  alone [52] .
a phase i study of combination therapy with lenalidomide and
 xxxd253xxx  enrolled 18 patients with mds: three with intermediate-1, nine with intermediate-2, and six with high risk according
to the ipss. this treatment regimen was well tolerated as no
dlts were noted in any of the six dosing cohorts tested and
the mtd was not reached. the overall response rate for the
17 assessable patients enrolled was 71%, with 41% of patients
achieving a cr [53] .
phase ii studies

based on preclinical data suggesting that hypomethylating agents
in combination with hdac inhibitors may restore all-transretinoic acid (atra) sensitivity in vitro, investigators at md
anderson cancer center (tx, usa) designed a phase i/ii study
to test the combination of  xxxd253xxx ,  xxxd3485xxx  (vpa) and

drug profile

cataldo, cortes & quintás-cardama

commonly observed nonhematologic toxicities associated with
subcutaneous  xxxd253xxx  use were nausea (70%), anemia (70%)
and vomiting (54%). injection-site reactions were reported in
35% of patients. these reactions are typically mild and can be
greatly ameliorated with the application of cold or warm compresses over the injection site for 2–4 h postinjection. when
 xxxd253xxx  was administered intravenously, the most common
side effects were petechiae (46%), weakness (35%), rigors (35%)
and hypokalemia (31%).
regulatory affairs

 xxxd253xxx  is approved for the treatment of the following fab
subtypes of mds:
• refractory anemia
• refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or in those patients who are
transfusion dependent)
• refractory anemia with excess blasts
• refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation
 xxxd253xxx  is also indicated for the treatment of cmml.
 xxxd253xxx  received expanded us fda approval in august,
2008, to reflect the improvement in overall survival achieved in
the aza-001 study involving patients with higher risk mds.
this indication implements the 2004 fda authorization of
 xxxd253xxx  as the first therapy approved in the usa for the
treatment of patients with mds. as discussed, there is currently
extensive investigation regarding the off-label use of  xxxd253xxx 
for the treatment of aml.
conclusion

dissection of the mechanisms of action of hypomethylating
agents, such as  xxxd253xxx , will be of the utmost importance for
the rational design of future trials in mds. however, several
issues warrant further investigation in order to maximize clinical
outcomes. first, although it has been shown that responses to
epigenetic modulators such as the hypomethylating agents usually occur after several cycles of treatment, it is still unclear what
is the proper dose schedule and length of therapy. moreover, a
direct comparison of  xxxd253xxx  with other hypomethylating
agents, such as  xxxd1823xxx , is necessary to ascertain the efficacy
and safety profiles of both hypomethylating agents. the apparent lack of cross-resistance between  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx 
suggests the interesting possibility of combinatorial or sequential
use of these agents may improve clinical outcomes. several phase
i/ii studies are currently evaluating the activity of different combinations of hypomethylating agents with hdac inhibitors or
other targeted agents for the treatment of mds.

survival compared with supportive care, a strategy commonly
employed in elderly patients with mds in the absence of safer
and more effective therapeutic interventions. it remains to be
seen whether other hypomethylating agents will be able to replicate the results observed with  xxxd253xxx  in phase iii trials and
whether  xxxd253xxx  will impact survival in patients with aml in
a similar manner. it must be noted, however, that despite these
encouraging results, the activity of  xxxd253xxx  in mds is far
from that observed with other targeted agents, such as tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, in hematologic malignancies, such as chronic
myeloid leukemia or hypereosinophilic syndrome. it is therefore
clear that novel therapeutic options with improved activity are
urgently needed to improve outcomes in mds. in the meantime, the next few years will be critical for the development of
 xxxd253xxx . three areas of research are particularly relevant for
the development of  xxxd253xxx -based therapy for mds. first,
the development of an oral formulation of  xxxd253xxx  is underway based on the favorable pharmacokinetic results currently
available. a safe and orally active formulation of  xxxd253xxx 
would simplify the dosing schedule, improve both the toxicity
profile and patient’s compliance, and enable alternate dosing
strategies ranging from intermittent high-dose to continuous
low-dose schemas to maximize and fine tune dna demethylation. a careful evaluation of this formulation in phase i studies is, therefore, warranted to realize the full potential of oral
 xxxd253xxx . second,  xxxd253xxx  may play a role in the treatment
of aml as well as other malignancies, such as lymphomas,
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
myeloproliferative disorders or even solid tumors. in this regard,
 xxxd253xxx  could potentially be useful in the management of
elderly patients with poor-risk aml, whom, by and large, are
not candidates to receive intensive chemotherapeutic regimens,
or as maintenance therapy in younger patients after intensive
induction/consolidation therapy or sct. finally, the development of novel  xxxd253xxx -based epigenetic regimens involving
more potent hdac inhibitors could improve upon the clinical activity of current epigenetic therapeutic strategies. several
ongoing clinical trials will determine the activity of  xxxd253xxx 
in all the aforementioned indications and will define the future
use of this hypomethylating agent.

drug profile

key issues
• myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) is a malignant disorder of hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow, leading to peripheral cytopenias
and a considerable risk for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.
• the incidence of mds is 3.3 cases per 100,000 people, and the rate of the disease is increasing.
• prior to the advent of novel therapeutic agents, such as the dna methyltransferase inhibitor  xxxd253xxx , allogeneic stem cell
transplantation offered the best treatment modality for mds.
• recently  xxxd253xxx  has been shown to prolong the survival of patients with high-risk mds compared with conventional care, which
has resulted in an updated label for this product.
• the most effective dose and schedule of administration of  xxxd253xxx , as well as the most beneficial agents to combine with
 xxxd253xxx , are areas of intense clinical investigation in the treatment of mds.
