presynaptic a2a/d-autoreceptors in the brain cortex of cercopithecus aethiops

received: 7 october 1996 / accepted: 22 november 1996

abstract the existence of presynaptic a2-autoreceptors,
and the subtype to which the receptors belong, were studied in the brain cortex from two african green monkeys
(cercopithecus aethiops). slices of the brain cortex were
preincubated with 3h-noradrenaline. the slices were then
superfused with medium containing desipramine (1 lm)
and stimulated electrically with trains of 72 pulses, 3 hz.
concentration-response curves of nine a-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined. all antagonists enhanced the
stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium, i.e. the release of
noradrenaline, indicating the existence of presynaptic a2autoreceptors. the ec30% values of the antagonists (concentrations that increased the evoked overflow of tritium
by 30%) were taken as a measure of affinity for the autoreceptors. the subclassification was based on a comparison of these affinity estimates with affinities for a2a, a2b,
a2c and a2d radioligand binding sites and for previously
classified a2a- and a2d-autoreceptors. the comparison indicates that the a2-autoreceptors in the brain cortex of cercopithecus aethiops belong to the genetic a2a/d and not
the a2b or a2c subtype. in their pharmacological properties, the autoreceptors are closest to the pharmacological
a2d subtype. the results support the notion that a2-autoreceptors belong at least predominantly to the a2a/d subtype
of a2-adrenoceptors.

gically different subtypes, a2a, a2b, a2c and a2d. the genetic a2a/d subtype represents orthologous receptors, derived from a common ancestor gene, but with sufficient inter-species differences in drug affinities to yield the two
pharmacological subtypes a2a and a2d. the a2a/d subtype
with a2a pharmacology occurs in humans, rabbits and
pigs, whereas the subtype with a2d pharmacology occurs
in rats, mice, guinea pigs and cows (see bylund et al.
1994; trendelenburg et al. 1996 a).
there is now much evidence to support the suggestion
(trendelenburg et al. 1993) that presynaptic a2-autoreceptors, the prototype a2-adrenoceptors (langer 1974; starke
1977), belong to the a2a/d branch of the a2-adrenoceptor
tree (recent studies: limberger et al. 1995a; starke et al.
1995; trendelenburg et al. 1996a; wahl et al. 1996). an
apparent exception are the a2-autoreceptors in the human
kidney and in human atria which were classified as a2c
(trendelenburg et al. 1994; rump et al. 1995), in contrast
to the autoreceptors in the human saphenous vein (molderings and göthert 1995) and probably brain cortex
(raiteri et al. 1992; see introduction of limberger et al.
1995a) which obey the rule and are a2a.
a2-autoreceptors have not been studied to our knowledge in non-human primates, although the a2a/d protein
has been shown, by immunocytochemistry, to occur in
neuronal perikarya in the locus coeruleus of some monkey
species (aoki et al. 1994). we recently had the opportunity to obtain brains from african green monkeys (cercopithecus aethiops) and used them to demonstrate and subclassify a2-autoreceptors in the cortex. demonstration and
subclassification were based on the noradrenaline releaseenhancing effects of nine a-adrenoceptor antagonists.

introduction
a2-adrenoceptors seem to comprise three genetically different subtypes, a2a/d, a2b and a2c, and four pharmacoloa.-u. trendelenburg (✉) · i. sutej · k. starke

materials and methods
brains from two african green monkeys were obtained from the institut für medizinische mikrobiologie und hygiene, freiburg i.br., germany (professor dieter neumann-haefelin). the animals were used
in a study of foamy virus infection but had no clinical symptoms, and
there was no demonstrable viral gene expression in the brain. they

342
were deeply anaesthetized by i.m. injection of ketamine (ketavet;
5 mg/kg) and xylazine (rompun; 2 mg/kg). after intracardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.0, 10 8c), the brain was
quickly removed and chilled in ice-cold medium (see below). thirty
to forty round slices, 0.4 mm thick, 3.0 mm diameter, were prepared
from the occipito-parietal cortex, parallel to the surface, after a superficial layer of 0.4 mm had been removed. about one third of the
slices was used for a noradrenaline release experiment immediately.
the remaining slices were stored in ice-cold medium aerated with
95% o2/5% co2 for up to 9 h. results of noradrenaline release experiments carried out after 9 h did not differ from results of experiments carried out immediately.
for a single release experiment, twelve to fourteen slices were incubated with (–)-3h-noradrenaline (0.1 lm) in 4 ml medium for
30 min at 37 8c. twelve slices were then transferred into superfusion
chambers (limberger et al. 1989), one slice per chamber, and superfused with 3h-noradrenaline-free medium containing desipramine (1
lm) at a rate of 0.8 ml/min for 149 min. there were five periods of
electrical stimulation, each consisting of 72 rectangular pulses, 1 ms
width, 3 hz and 35 v/cm voltage drop between the electrodes, yielding a current strength of 60 ma. the first stimulation period was delivered at t = 30 min (t = 0 min being the start of superfusion) and
was not used for determination of tritium overflow. the following
periods (s1 to s4) were applied at t = 56, 83, 110 and 137 min. successive 3-min samples of the superfusate were collected from
t = 50 min onwards. a-adrenoceptor antagonists were added at increasing concentrations 15 min before s2, s3 and s4 to yield cumulative concentration-response curves. in each experiment with 12 brain
slices, at least one slice was superfused with antagonist-free medium
throughout (control). at the end of experiments, the tissue was dissolved, and tritium was determined in superfusate samples and tissues.
the medium contained (mm): nacl 118, kcl 4.8, cacl2 1.3,
 xxxd2534xxx  1.2, nahco3 25, kh2po4 1.2, glucose 11,  xxxd228xxx 
0.57 and disodium edta 0.03. for superfusion, desipramine (1 lm)
was added.
the outflow of tritium was calculated as fractional rate (min–1),
and the electrically evoked overflow, after subtraction of the estimated basal outflow, as a percentage of the tritium content of the tissue at the onset of stimulation (limberger et al. 1995a). for further
evaluation, sn/s1 overflow ratios were calculated (s2/s1, s3/s1, s4/s1).
percentage changes of sn/s1 ratios induced by antagonists added after
s1 were calculated for each single brain slice, taking as reference value the average corresponding sn/s1 ratio in controls in which no antagonist was added. basal tritium outflow was evaluated similarly,
using the samples collected immediately before stimulation periods.
results are expressed as arithmetic means ± sem. antagonist
pec30% values (negative logarithms of concentrations that enhanced
the evoked overflow of tritium by 30%) were interpolated from the
nearest points of the averaged concentration-response curves. n is the
number of brain slices.

nci; n = 59: the total number of brain slices in this study).
in control experiments (no antagonist) the fractional rate
of basal tritium outflow declined slowly, whereas the electrically evoked overflow (% of tissue tritium) remained approximately constant from s1 to s4: control s2/s1, s3/s1

and s4/s1 ratios were 1.02 ± 0.02, 1.03 ± 0.03 and 1.05 ±
0.03 respectively (n = 7; fig. 1). tetrodotoxin (0.3 lm),
when added 15 min before s2 for the remainder of the experiment, abolished the overflow response to s2, s3 and s4
(n = 4).
the nine a-adrenoceptor antagonists increased the stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium. figure 1 shows a representative experiment with rauwolscine, and concentration-response curves are shown in fig. 2. the maximal increase was by 256 ± 23% (idazoxan 1 lm). the pec30%
values were: rx 821002 9.1; efaroxan 8.8; rauwolscine
8.6; idazoxan 8.4; wb 4101 7.9; spiroxatrine 7.7; benoxathian 7.1;  xxxd3393xxx  7.0;  xxxd3000xxx  6.3.
rx 821002, efaroxan, spiroxatrine and  xxxd3000xxx 
slightly accelerated the basal efflux of tritium. the increase exceeded 30% only for  xxxd3000xxx  (1 lm; increase by
106%; see introduction of limberger et al. 1995a).

discussion
the electrically evoked overflow of tritium in the present
kind of experiment reflects action potential-induced release
of 3h-noradrenaline (starke 1977). the blockade by tetrodotoxin is in accord with this view. the relatively long
pulse trains used (24 s) led to a2-autoinhibition as indicated by the release-enhancing effect of all a-adrenoceptor
antagonists. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of presynaptic a2-autoreceptors in the brain of a subhuman primate (see starke et al. 1989). the pec30% values of the antagonists will be taken as estimates of their
affinity for the a2-autoreceptors. antagonist pkd values
against exogenous agonists are better estimates; if, for example, an a-adrenoceptor antagonist also blocks calcium
channels at axon terminals, this will attenuate the enhancement of release that results from a2-autoreceptor blockade
and will hence decrease the pec30%, but will not distort
its effect against an exogenous agonist. however, the tissue available was limited. moreover, in our previous studies on a2-autoreceptors antagonist pec30% and pkd values
correlated closely and gave identical receptor classifications (limberger et al. 1992, 1995a; trendelenburg et al.
1995; wahl et al. 1996).
the subclassification now to be discussed will be based
on two comparisons. first, the pec30% values of the antagonists at the a2-autoreceptors in cercopithecus aethiops
brain cortex will be correlated with their pkd values at
previously subclassified a2 sites (table 1 and fig. 3). second, affinity ratios will be compared; specifically, ratios of
the antagonist ec30% values at the monkey brain a2-autoreceptors will be compared with kd ratios at previously
subclassified a2 sites (table 2). the previously subclassified sites will be native a2 radioligand binding sites, a2
radioligand binding sites in cos cells transfected with human or rat a2-adrenoceptor genes, and other presynaptic
a2-autoreceptors.
correlation with native a2 radioligand binding sites indicates that the presynaptic a2-autoreceptors in cercopithe-

cus aethiops brain cortex are neither a2b nor a2c: there is
no or only a relatively weak correlation of the antagonist
pec30% values at the a2-autoreceptors with their pkd values at native a2b (neonatal rat lung) and a2c (opossum
kidney cell line) binding sites (table 1a); the correlations
with the pkd values at the a2a binding sites in ht29 cells
(a human cell line), the a2d binding sites in bovine pineal
gland, and the a2d binding sites in rat submaxillary gland
are better (and similar; table 1a). the correlation with
radioligand binding sites in cos cells transfected with a2adrenoceptor genes is especially interesting because the
autoreceptors can be compared with all three human a2adrenoceptors (and with the rat a2d-receptor); again the
correlation with a2b and a2c is non-significant or relatively weak, whereas the correlations with human a2a and
rat a2d sites are excellent (and similar; fig. 3, table 1b).
the correlation with other presynaptic a2-autoreceptors
suggests that monkey brain a2-autoreceptors bear closer resemblance to a2d- than to a2a-autoreceptors: there is excellent correlation of the pec30% values with pkd values
at the a2d-autoreceptors in guinea-pig brain, mouse brain
and mouse atria; the correlation with a2a-autoreceptors is
lower (table 2c). taken together, this first kind of comparison – correlation analysis – indicates that the a2-auto-

receptors in cercopithecus aethiops brain cortex belong to
the a2a/d and not the a2b or a2c subtype, with greater similarity to a2d than to a2a.
the second kind of comparison – affinity ratios –
points in the same direction. the comparison of antagonist
ec30% ratios at cercopithecus aethiops brain cortex a2autoreceptors (table 2a) with their kd ratios at previously
subclassified a2 radioligand binding sites (table 2b; na-

tive binding sites and binding sites in transfected cos
cells pooled) again differentiates the autoreceptors from
a2b and a2c. for example, the  xxxd3393xxx /spiroxatrine ratio
is 5.0 at the autoreceptors but 333 at a2b binding sites, a
67 fold difference, and 376 at a2c binding sites, a 75 fold
difference. the  xxxd3000xxx / xxxd3393xxx  ratio is 5.0 at the autoreceptors but 0.04 at a2b sites, a 125 fold difference, and
0.07 at a2c sites,  xxxd2051xxx  fold difference. the agreement with

345

a2a is slightly and the agreement with a2d much better: all
but one of the ec30% ratios at the autoreceptors differ less
than 8 fold from the corresponding kd ratios at a2a sites
(the exception being idazoxan/benoxathian where the difference is 68 fold); and all ec30% ratios at the autoreceptors differ less than 9 fold from the corresponding kd ratios at a2d sites. finally, the comparison with other presynaptic a2-autoreceptors (table 2c) supports the closer similarity to a2d than to a2a: the ec30% ratios differ maximally 40 fold (idazoxan/benoxathian) from corresponding
kd ratios at the a2a-autoreceptors of rabbit brain cortex
but differ maximally only 4 fold (idazoxan/rauwolscine)
from corresponding kd ratios at the a2d-autoreceptors of
guinea-pig brain cortex.
both kinds of comparison, hence, demonstrate that the
a2-autoreceptors in the brain cortex of cercopithecus
aethiops are a2a/d and not a2b or a2c. from the phylogenetic relationship we expected an a2a pharmacology, i.e.
the pharmacology of the human version of the a2a/d-adrenoceptor. however, although there was greater resemblance to a2a than to a2b and a2c, all comparisons indicate closest agreement with a2d, the version of the a2a/dadrenoceptor that occurs in rats, mice and guinea pigs.
perhaps the structure of the a2a/d-adrenoceptor is such
that small changes in amino acid sequence, in closely related species, have noticeable consequences for drug affinities. perhaps also the pharmacologic properties of the
a2a/d-adrenoceptor are especially susceptible to its physical environment as defined, for example, by the tissue. in
support of this speculation, some rodent a2-autoreceptors
(rat atria, rat kidney, mouse atria) display features distinct
from “typical” a2d radioligand binding studies and also
distinct from other rodent a2-autoreceptors (for example
rat submaxillary gland, rat brain cortex, mouse brain cortex; see wahl et al. 1996). at any rate, the present a2a/d
diagnosis is in accord with the hypothesis that a2-autoreceptors belong at least predominantly to the a2a/d branch
of the a2-adrenoceptor tree, across mammalian species
(trendelenburg et al. 1993; starke et al. 1995).
