1 the agonist-speci®c coupling properties of the three cloned human a2-adrenoceptor subtypes
have been compared, when expressed at similar levels in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell lines,
using noradrenaline and (+)-meta-octopamine as agonists.
2 noradrenaline can couple the receptor to both the inhibition and stimulation of forskolinstimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production in all three receptor subtypes, with the relative strength of the
coupling to the pathways varying for each of the receptor subtypes.
3 meta-octopamine selectively couples the a2a-adrenoceptor only to the inhibition of forskolinstimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production. however, meta-octopamine couples the a2b- and a2cadrenoceptors to both the inhibition and stimulation of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production.
4 the relative potency of meta-octopamine to noradrenaline varies between the dierent a2adrenoceptor subtypes. the eects of meta-octopamine are around two orders of magnitude less
potent than those of noradrenaline on both the a2a- and a2b-adrenoceptor subtypes. in contrast, in
the case of the a2c-adrenoceptor, meta-octopamine is only one order of magnitude less potent than
noradrenaline in the stimulation of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production and, in addition, is
equipotent with noradrenaline in the inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production and
has an increased maximal response. this raises the possibility that meta-octopamine may have
physiologically important actions via a2c-adrenoceptors in vivo.
5 the results show that the modulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production occurs in both a subtype- and
agonist-speci®c manner for a2a-adrenoceptors and in a subtype speci®c manner for a2b- and a2cadrenoceptors.

introduction
agonist-speci®c coupling (agonist tracking) of g-protein
coupled receptors to dierent second messenger systems has
been demonstrated for a wide range of receptors (see evans et
al., 1995b; kenakin, 1995). we have previously shown that the
meta- and para- isomers of the biogenic amine, octopamine,
which is a naturally occurring ligand of sympathetic aadrenoreceptors, can couple a cloned human a2a-adrenoceptor
to multiple second messenger systems when expressed in a
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell line (evans et al., 1995a;
airriess et al., 1996). in contrast to the catecholamines, which
couple the a2a-adrenoceptor to both a concentration-dependent decrease and increase in the rate of  xxxd1773xxx 
production, the structural isomers of octopamine were only
able to couple the receptor to a concentration-dependent
decrease in  xxxd1773xxx  production (airriess et al., 1997).
these results suggest that the cloned human a2a-adrenoceptor
can be coupled selectively, by dierent endogenous agonists, to
g-protein pathways mediating the regulation of adenylyl
cyclase activity. we have also shown the importance of
conserved serine residues in transmembrane domain v (tmv)

the receptor to the inhibition and stimulation of adenylyl
cyclase activity by noradrenaline and the structural isomers of
octopamine (rudling et al., 1997; 1999).
all mammalian species appear to express three separate a2adrenoceptor subtypes (bylund et al., 1994). in humans, the
three genes encoding these receptor subtypes have been cloned.
they are designated a2c10, a2c4 and a2c2 based on their
human chromosomal location. the cloned a2c10 gene
corresponds to the a2a-pharmacological subtype (kobilka et
al., 1987), whilst the cloned a2c4 gene corresponds to the a2cpharmacological subtype (regan et al., 1988) and the a2c2
gene corresponds to the a2b-pharmacological subtype (lomasney et al., 1990).
a2-adrenoceptors are widely distributed in peripheral
tissues and in the central nervous system where they carry
out a wide range of functions (mcgrath et al., 1989; bylund et
al., 1994; macdonald et al., 1997; docherty, 1998). recent
results from knock-out mouse strains suggest that a2aadrenoceptors are likely to mediate most, but not all, of the
classical eects ascribed to a2-adrenoceptor agonists. similar
studies on a2b-adrenoceptors indicate that they have a more
restricted distribution in the brain being exclusively found in
the thalamus. however, in peripheral blood vessels they may
be responsible for the initial hypertensive eects observed upon

934

j.e. rudling et al

the intravenous injection of a2-adrenoceptor agonists. studies
on the distribution of a2c-adrenoceptors show that they are
again widely distributed in both the brain and peripheral
tissues. at present their functional role remains enigmatic and
it has been suggested that they may act to modulate subtly the
actions of the other two a2-adrenoceptor subtypes and be
involved in the ®ne tuning of responses (see macdonald et al.,
1997).
evidence is accumulating that the three a2-adrenoceptor
subtypes, as well as being pharmacologically distinct, also
exhibit dierences in their rates of desensitization, in their
tracking properties, in their association with scaolding
proteins and in their coupling capacities to second messenger
systems, such as those involving adenylyl cyclase, protein
kinase c,  xxxd208xxx  and calcium (e.g. see kukkonen et
al., 1998; peltonen et al., 1998; pihlavisto et al., 1998;
audubert et al., 1999; olli-laèhdesmaèki et al., 1999; prezeau
et al., 1999; takesono et al., 1999). the ability of the three a2adrenoceptor subtypes to regulate the  xxxd1773xxx  second
messenger pathway, has been extensively studied in numerous
cell lines (duzic & lanier, 1992; eason et al., 1992; 1994;
jansson et al., 1994b; naèsman et al., 1997; pohjanoksa et al.,
1997). however, a great degree of variability has been observed
in the results obtained from these studies, which has been
attributed variously to the receptor density, the environment of
the cell line and the agonist used. in the present study, we
report on the agonist-speci®c properties of noradrenaline and
(+)meta-octopamine to couple the three a2-adrenoceptor
subtypes, expressed at similar levels in cho cells, to the
modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. a brief account of
some of this work has already been published in abstract form
(rudling & evans, 1998).

methods
cell culture
transfected chinese hamster ovary cells with low expression
levels of either the cloned human a2a- (592.4+58.6 fmol
receptor mg71 protein, n=8), a2b- (446.9+52.6 fmol receptor
mg71 protein, n=8) or a2c- (465.6+26.5 fmol receptor mg71
protein, n=8) adrenoceptor subtype, were kindly made
available to the laboratory by prof r.j. lefkowitz, howard
hughes medical institute, duke university, durham, u.s.a.
the cells were grown to near con¯uency in cell culture at 378c
with 10% co2. the culture medium consisted of ham's f-12
nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% bovine foetal calf
serum, penicillin (50 units ml71) and streptomycin
(50 mg ml71).  xxxd2191xxx  sulphate (50 mg ml71) was also included
in the culture medium to ensure only cells expressing the a2adrenoceptor subtypes were selected. twenty-four hour preincubation of the cells in growth medium containing pertussis
toxin (200 ng ml71), uncoupled the gi-mediated inhibition of
 xxxd1773xxx  production (see rudling et al., 1999). inhibition of
the agonist-dependent gs-mediated stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx 
production was achieved by 24 h pre-incubation of cells in
growth medium containing 20 mg ml71 cholera toxin. this
concentration of cholera toxin has previously been shown to be
sucient for complete adp-ribosylation of all substrates,
without being detrimental to the cells (eason et al., 1992)

membrane preparation
cells were washed by rinsing 150 mm culture dishes with 5 ml
of dulbecco's phosphate buered saline three times, to remove

a2-adrenoceptor subtype coupling

the culture medium. the cells were scraped into 4 ml of icecold lysis buer (50 mm, napo4, ph 7.4, 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx ) and
then washed with a further 4 ml of ice-cold lysis buer. after
the cells had been incubated on ice for 15 min, they were lysed
with a dounce homogenizer by performing 20 complete
strokes using a small clearance pestle. the cell lysate was
centrifuged at 10006g for 5 min to pellet whole cells and cell
nuclei. the supernatant was further centrifuged at 28,0006g
for 30 min at 48c to pellet the crude membrane fraction. the
resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in lysis buer and
stored at 7708c. protein concentrations were determined
using a protein assay kit (merck), based on the method of
bradford (1976), with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a reference
standard.

ligand binding studies
radioligand binding assays using [3h]-yohimbine were carried
out to determine the expression levels of the a2-adrenoceptor
subtypes in the cho cell lines. membranes (100 ± 150 mg
protein) were incubated at 378c for 20 min in the presence of
6 nm [methyl-3h]-yohimbine (91 ci mmol71) (amersham
pharmacia biotech) in binding assay buer ((mm) nacl 150,
mgcl2 5, edta 20, tris 50, ph 7.4) with varying concentrations of unlabelled yohimbine (expression level assays) or
agonist (competitive displacement assays), in a ®nal incubation
volume of 500 ml. non-speci®c binding was determined in the
presence of 1 mm yohimbine (expression level assays) or
100 mm  xxxd2914xxx  (competitive displacement assays). the
reaction was terminated by dilution with 500 ml of ice-cold
buer and centrifugation at 48c at 20,8006g for 10 min. the
pellets were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold buer and
recentrifuged. finally, the pellets were resuspended in 100 ml
of 0.1 m naoh and added to 7 ml of scintillation ¯uid for
counting.
radioligand binding curves were analysed using a nonlinear regression program of graphpad software. the
binding data was best ®tted by a one site model (see rudling
et al., 1999). the bmax was then converted from c.p.m.s. to
pmol mg71 membrane protein. data represent the means of
three separate experiments performed in duplicate.

 xxxd1773xxx  production
cells were ®rst washed, by rinsing culture plates (60 mm) with
3 ml of dulbecco's phosphate buered saline (pbs; gibco), to
remove culture medium. they were then incubated for 20 min
at 378c in pbs containing 100 mm  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ; sigma), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. the
cells were then exposed to solutions of agonists at speci®c
concentrations in the presence of 10 mm  xxxd1742xxx  (sigma), a
membrane permeant adenylyl cyclase activator, plus 100 mm
 xxxd2388xxx . solutions of 10 mm  xxxd1742xxx  plus 100 mm  xxxd2388xxx  alone
were used to determine the control rate of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
 xxxd1773xxx  production. incubations were terminated after
20 min at 378c, by removal of the pbs followed by the
addition of 500 ml of ice-cold, acidi®ed ethanol (60 ml
absolute-etoh : 1 ml 1 n hcl). the plates were scraped and
pooled with two subsequent 250 ml washes with acidi®ed
ethanol. the cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at
17,9006g for 5 min. the supernatant was evaporated to
dryness by means of a vacuum centrifuge (savant) and the
residue was re-suspended in 150 ml of tris/edta buer.
 xxxd1773xxx  levels were determined in duplicate using a [8-3h] xxxd1773xxx  assay kit (biotrak trk 432, amersham
pharmacia biotech).

j.e. rudling et al

dose response curves for the various agonists, both with
and without pertussis toxin or cholera toxin pre-treatment of
the cells, were constructed for concentrations ranging from
0.1 nm to 1 mm. the concentration of  xxxd1773xxx  (pmol
plate71) in experimental dishes was expressed as a percentage
of the [ xxxd1773xxx ] in the control dishes from the same group.
four control dishes were compared with each group of
fourteen experimental dishes. pic50 and/or pec50 values were
calculated for individual experiments where data sets reached a
clear plateau by ®tting to a sigmoidal dose-response (variable
slope) equation. means and s.e.mean were then calculated
from the results of three or more individual experiments
carried out in duplicate. for data sets that failed to reach a
clear maximum over the concentration range tested only a
maximum percentage of the control value reached is given.
the  xxxd1773xxx  levels obtained in the transfected cho cell
lines after  xxxd1742xxx -stimulation were 605+63 pmol/dish
(n=12) for non-pretreated control cells, 368+31 pmol/dish
(n=12) for ptx pretreated cells and 8093+444 pmol/dish
(n=12) for ctx pretreated cells. non-transfected cho-k1
cells showed no response to treatment with either (7)noradrenaline or (+)-meta-octopamine (data not shown).
analysis of variance (anova) was used to test for
signi®cant agonist-mediated eects in individual experiments.
signi®cant anova's were then further analysed by tukey's
hsd multiple comparison test, to determine at what
concentration the levels of  xxxd1773xxx  production diered
signi®cantly from the  xxxd1742xxx -only control values. unless
otherwise stated, all data are shown as mean+s.e.mean.

 xxxd208xxx  release
four hours prior to experimentation [3h]- xxxd208xxx 
(214 ci mmol71, amersham pharmacia biotech) was added to
the cho cell media (3 mci/ml). the cells were washed with
pbs containing 1% bsa and 10 mm glucose (pbg) and
subsequently incubated with pbg containing 10 mm licl
(pbg/li) for 20 min at 378c. the dishes were then stimulated
with varying concentrations of agonist (dissolved in pbg/li)
for 20 min (378c). at the end of the incubation period 200 ml
aliquots of the incubation media were transferred to
scintillation vials and counted for 5 min. four independent
experiments were conducted in triplicate for both (7)noradrenaline and (+)-meta-octopamine for each receptor
subtype.

a2-adrenoceptor subtype coupling

experiments on the human a2a-adrenoceptor using a cell line
with similar expression levels to those expressing the a2b- and
the a2c-adrenoceptor subtypes.
(7)-noradrenaline following 20 min of incubation with
(7)-noradrenaline, a maximum signi®cant inhibition of cyclic
amp production to 75.1+7.6% (n=9) of the control value
(f=2.46; d.f.=6,43; p50.05) was seen in a2a-adrenoceptor
expressing cho cells exposed to an agonist concentration of
1 mm (figure 1a). this inhibitory response had a pic50 of
7.92+0.46. at higher concentrations of (7)-noradrenaline the
inhibitory eects of the agonist were not signi®cantly altered.
in contrast to some previous studies (fraser et al., 1989; eason
et al., 1992; airriess et al., 1997; rudling et al., 1999) in the
transfected cell line used in this study, with a lower expression
level, the coupling of the a2a-adrenoceptor to  xxxd1773xxx 
production did not display a biphasic appearance. however,
after 24 h pre-incubation with ptx, the inhibition of cyclic
amp production was abolished and replaced by a signi®cant
stimulation (f=7.24; d.f.=6,31; p50.001) with a maximum
eect at an agonist concentration of 1 mm (161.1+10.8% of
control value; n=5) (figure 1a). pec50 values of 4.72 and 5.84
were obtained for this stimulatory phase in two independent
experiments which reached a clear plateau, indicating that this
occurred at a higher concentration than the pic50 of the
inhibitory phase. when a2a-adrenoceptor-transfected cho
cells were pre-incubated with ctx for 24 h, to persistently
activate the stimulatory g-proteins (gs), the dose response
curve reached a maximum inhibitory level of 65.5+9.0% of
control value (n=7) and had a pic50 of 7.76+0.12 which did
not signi®cantly dier from that obtained in the absence of
ctx pre-treatment (figure 1a).

results

(+)-meta-octopamine similar results, to those obtained
using a cho cell line expressing high receptor levels (airriess
et al., 1997; rudling et al., 1999), were observed when cho
cells expressing low levels of a2a-adrenoceptors were exposed
to (+)-meta-octopamine. signi®cant inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx 
production occurred at (+)-meta-octopamine concentrations
of 10 mm and above (f=4.17; d.f.=6,58; p50.05) (figure 1b).
the inhibitory phase reached a maximum of 71.0+7.5%
(n=8) of the control value and had a pic50 of 5.30+0.39.
however, the maximum inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production
by (+)-meta-octopamine in this transfected cell line was about
10% less than that occurring with the cell line with the higher
expression level (airriess et al., 1997; rudling et al., 1999).
after pre-incubation with ptx, no stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx 
production was revealed after exposure to (+)-meta-octopamine (figure 1b). this is in contrast to the results obtained
with (7)-noradrenaline after ptx pre-treatment. in addition,
after ctx pre-treatment of the cells, (+)-meta-octopamine did
not produce an enhanced inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production,
compared with data obtained in the absence of ctx (figure
1b).

a2a-adrenoceptor  xxxd1773xxx  response

a2b-adrenoceptor  xxxd1773xxx  response

our previous studies have shown an agonist speci®c coupling
of the cloned human a2a-adrenoceptor to the modulation of
 xxxd1773xxx  production when the receptor is expressed in
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells (airriess et al., 1997;
rudling et al., 1999). however, suggestions have been made
that such coupling properties may be dependent on the
receptor expression level in clonal cell lines. thus, to facilitate
a comparison of these results with the other two cloned
subtypes of the human a2-adrenoceptor, we have repeated our

(7)-noradrenaline incubation of cho cells stably expressing the cloned human a2b-adrenoceptor with (7)-noradrenaline, in the absence of either ptx or ctx pre-treatment,
resulted in the agonist causing a maximum signi®cant
stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production when administered at
10 mm and above (695.1+172.0% of the control value; n=5)
(f=4.38; d.f.=6,31; p50.05) (figure 2a). pec50 values of
7.17 and 7.00 were obtained for this stimulatory phase in two
independent experiments which reached a clear plateau. this

dramatic stimulation was enhanced, by 2 ± 3 fold, after pretreating the cells with ptx, with the maximum signi®cant

after pertussis toxin pretreatment it did not couple the receptor to a

however, although this implies that in the absence of ptx

(+)-meta-octopamine stimulation of a2b-adrenoceptor
transfected cho cells with (+)-meta-octopamine, revealed
similar dose response curves, under all three conditions, to
those obtained with (7)-noradrenaline. a signi®cant maximal
stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production to 526.2+79.3% of
control (n=11) occurred at agonist concentrations of 1 mm
(f=19.27; d.f.=6,62; p50.01) (figure 2b). this stimulatory
phase had a pec50 of 4.99+0.20. however, the maximum
stimulation caused by (+)-meta-octopamine was slightly less
than that observed with (7)-noradrenaline. again, this
stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production was enhanced after
ptx pre-treatment, with maximum signi®cant eects being
observed at a concentration of 1 mm (960.4+77.6% of the
control value; n=6) (f=84.14; d.f.=6,38; p50.001) (figure
2b). pec50 values of 5.27 and 5.43 were obtained for this
stimulatory phase in two independent experiments which
reached a clear plateau. in addition, ctx pre-treatment of
the cells failed to reveal any signi®cant inhibitory responses
over the concentration range tested (p50.05) (figure 2b).

these conditions, the maximum level of stimulation produced
by the two agonists is comparable over the concentration range
tested. however, (+)-meta-octopamine is equipotent with
(7)-noradrenaline at coupling the a2c-adrenoceptor to the
inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production. after ctx pretreatment
of the cells, exposure to (+)-meta-octopamine concentrations

a2c-adrenoceptor  xxxd1773xxx  response
(7)-noradrenaline in marked contrast to the other a2adrenoceptor subtypes after exposure to (7)-noradrenaline,
the a2c-adrenoceptor did not show any signi®cant eect on
 xxxd1773xxx  production (p50.05) in the absence of ptx or
ctx pre-treatment (figure 3a). however, after 24 h pretreatment with either of the toxins, a change in the modulation
of  xxxd1773xxx  production was revealed over the concentration
range tested. after pre-incubation of the transfected cho cells
with ptx, activation of the a2c-adrenoceptors by (7)noradrenaline revealed a signi®cant stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx 
production at concentrations of 1 mm and above (f=6.11;
d.f.=6,58; p50.001) (figure 3a). a maximum eect of
159.2+7.6% (n=8) of the control value was observed, with
a pec50 of 6.58+0.12. exposure of (7)-noradrenaline to cells
pre-treated with ctx, resulted in an inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx 
production being observed over the same concentration range
as the stimulation was revealed after ptx pre-treatment
(figure 3a). this inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production reached
a maximum signi®cant level of 83.0+2.4% of control levels
(n=9) at 1 mm (f=5.32; d.f.=6,42; p50.01) and had a pic50
of 6.66+0.15. the appearance of a signi®cant stimulation and
inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production at (7)-noradrenaline
concentrations of 1 mm and above, after ptx and ctx pretreatment, respectively, may explain why no net change in
 xxxd1773xxx  production is observed in the absence of both
toxins over the concentration range tested.
(+)-meta-octopamine after incubation with (+)-meta-octopamine, a maximum signi®cant inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx 
production was observed at an agonist concentration of 1 mm
(f=4.02; d.f.=6,56; p50.05) (figure 3b). this inhibitory
phase reached a maximum of 86.2+8.59% of control values
(n=6) and had a pic50 of 6.60+0.12. at higher concentrations
of (+)-meta-octopamine the inhibitory eects decreased such
that by 100 mm there was no signi®cant variation (p50.05)
from the basal level of  xxxd1773xxx  production (101.8+2.2%
of the control value). this stimulatory phase of the biphasic

replaced by a dramatic stimulation with a maximum value of
171.5+9.6% (n=8) of control at 1 mm (+)-meta-octopamine
(f=24.17; d.f.=6,42; p50.001) (figure 3b). although (7)noradrenaline was about an order of magnitude more potent

of 1 mm and above results in a signi®cant inhibition of cyclic
amp production with a maximal inhibition to 66.0+6.7% of
control values at 1 mm (f=8.88; d.f.=6,42; p50.001) (figure
3b). pic50 values of 6.81 and 5.68 were obtained for this
inhibitory phase in two independent experiments. the
maximum inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production by (+)-metaoctopamine was about 15% greater than that brought about
by (7)-noradrenaline acting via the a2c-adrenoceptor.

does increased  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation involve the
activation of  xxxg1759xxx ?
the involvement of the activation of  xxxg1759xxx  (pla2)
in the a2-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in cellular cyclic
amp levels in the presence of ptx appears to be
controversial. fraser et al. (1989) suggested that pla2
activation could potentiate the agonist-mediated increases in
 xxxd1773xxx  levels in the presence of ptx and that the eect
depended on the receptor density in the transfected cho cells.
however, jones et al. (1991) suggested that in cho cells that
this eect was not altered by the pla2 inhibitor, quinacrine,
and that further, the activation of pla2 in these cells was
blocked by ptx. the latter observations have recently been
con®rmed by audubert et al. (1999). thus, to examine whether
pla2 activation could underlie any of the agonist-mediated
increases in  xxxd1773xxx  levels reported in the present
investigation, we have assessed the ability of both (7)noradrenaline and (+)-meta-octopamine to activate pla2
activity by measuring the agonist-induced release of  xxxd208xxx  from each of the three cho cell lines expressing the
a2-adrenoceptor subtypes at low expression levels. no
signi®cant agonist-stimulated release of  xxxd208xxx  was
observed for any of the cell lines studied at agonist
concentrations between 1 nm and 1 mm (data not shown).

discussion
the cloning of the human genes encoding the three separate a2adrenoceptor subtypes (kobilka et al., 1987; regan et al.,
1988; lomasney et al., 1990) has allowed the generation of
stable cell lines expressing single receptor subtypes. these have
allowed subtype-speci®c a2-adrenoceptor ligands to be
screened, and provided the opportunity for a2-adrenoceptormediated signalling pathways to be studied in detail, without

ligand binding
the dierences in the relative potencies of (7)-noradrenaline
and (+)-meta-octopamine between the dierent a2-adrenoceptor subtypes in the functional assays on  xxxd1773xxx 
accumulation could be explained by dierences in the anities
of the agonists between the dierent a2-adrenoceptor subtypes.
this possibility was tested directly by comparing the ability of
(7)-noradrenaline and (+)-meta-octopamine to displace the
binding of [3h]-yohimbine, an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist (see
table 1).
figure 4 indicates that the binding anity of each of the a2adrenoceptor subtypes is greater for (7)-noradrenaline than
for (+)-meta-octopamine. however, there are no substantial
dierences in binding anity for either agonist at each of the
a2-adrenoceptor subtypes. this suggests that dierences in
binding anity are unlikely to underlie the dierences in
potency observed for the agonists tested in the functional

interference from other receptor subtypes. in the present study,
cho cells transfected to separately express the a2-adrenoceptor subtypes, at similar expression levels, were used to examine
the ability of the agonists, noradrenaline and meta-octopamine, to couple the three receptor subtypes to the regulation of
 xxxd1773xxx  production. it is apparent from the results
obtained in this study (see summary table 2), that the
modulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production occurs in both a
subtype- and agonist-speci®c manner for a2a-adrenoceptors
and in a subtype speci®c manner for a2b- and a2cadrenoceptors.
in the present study, activation of the a2a-adrenoceptor
expressed in cho cells, by noradrenaline, results in the
receptor coupling to an inhibition in  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
 xxxd1773xxx  production, which is similar to results obtained
previously in several other cell lines including nih-3t3 cells,
sf9 cells, chinese hamster lung ®broblasts and  xxxd2715xxx  cells
(cotecchia et al., 1990; duzic & lanier, 1992; marjamaèki et
al., 1992; jansson et al., 1994a,b; 1995; naèsman et al., 1997).
however, the results dier to previous studies involving cho,
hek293, pc-12 and jeg-3 cells, where activation of a2aadrenoceptors by noradrenaline resulted in a biphasic response
in  xxxd1773xxx  production (fraser et al., 1989; duzic & lanier,
1992; eason et al., 1992; pepperl & regan, 1993; svensson et
al., 1996; airriess et al., 1997; jasper et al., 1998; rudling et al.,
1999). the receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase
activity in cho cells has previously been attributed to high
receptor expression levels (eason et al., 1992). thus, since the
expression level of the a2a-adrenoceptors in the cho cells used
in the present study was about 30 fold lower than in our
previous studies with another cho cell line (rudling et al.,
1999), this hypothesis may explain the lack of a biphasic doseresponse curve in our present experiments. however, pertussis
toxin pre-treatment of the cells resulted in a signi®cant 60%
increase in  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production being
observed. this demonstrates that when the a2a-adrenoceptor is
expressed at relatively low levels in a cho cell line it is
predominantly coupled to an inhibition in  xxxd1773xxx 
production, but that it is also capable of producing a
stimulatory response when the inhibitory pathway is blocked.
the dierential agonist-speci®c coupling properties of the
human a2a-adrenoceptor observed after exposure to noradrenaline and meta-octopamine in cho cells expressing the
receptor at high levels (rudling et al., 1999), were also
maintained at lower expression levels. this indicates that the
phenomenon is not an artifact due to high expression levels.
in contrast to the a2a-subtype, the a2b-adrenoceptor could
be coupled to the stimulation of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cyclic
amp production by both noradrenaline and meta-octopamine. however, meta-octopamine was around two orders of
magnitude less potent than noradrenaline at producing this
stimulatory response. these results agree with previous studies
using pc-12, sf9 and cho cells, where activation of the a2badrenoceptor by various agonists caused a stimulatory eect
on adenylyl cyclase activity (duzic & lanier, 1992; jansson et

al., 1995; eason & liggett, 1993). similar ®ndings have also
been demonstrated by measuring the coupling of the a2bsubtype to  xxxd1773xxx -dependent reporter gene expression in
transiently transfected jeg-3 cells (pepperl & regan, 1993).
however, when the a2b-subtype was expressed in  xxxd2715xxx  cells, it
was able to couple to the stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx 
production only after the cells had been pre-exposed to
pertussis toxin, an eect not observed with the other two a2adrenoceptor subtypes (jansson et al., 1994b). in contrast,
expression of the a2b-adrenoceptor in nih-3t3 cells (duzic &
lanier, 1992), cho cells (eason et al., 1992), astroglia cells
(enkvist et al., 1996), ddt1mf-2 cells (duzic & lanier, 1992),
and ng108-15 cells (sabol & nirenberg, 1979) resulted in an
inhibitory eect being observed upon activation of the
receptor.
the results observed in the present study, after pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, suggest that the
agonists tested are also capable of coupling the a2badrenoceptor to an inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production.
after pertussis toxin treatment of the cells to block the
inhibitory pathway, the stimulatory eect was magni®ed by 2 ±
3 fold. this is likely to be due to pertussis toxin-insensitive,
stimulatory g-proteins being able to couple the receptor to the
stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production without competition
from pertussis toxin-sensitive, inhibitory g-proteins (duzic &
lanier, 1992). however, when cholera toxin was used to block
the agonist-mediated stimulatory eect, no signi®cant increases in the inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  production were
observed. thus, these results suggest that the a2b-subtype is
more strongly coupled to the stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx 
production but also has the capability of producing a weak
inhibitory eect on  xxxd1773xxx  production in the transfected
cho cells which can reduce the stimulatory eect.
the most likely mechanism for a2b-mediated stimulation of
 xxxd1773xxx  production is a direct coupling to gs (eason et al.,
1992; jansson et al., 1995). the results from the present study
support a direct coupling to gs, as cholera toxin pretreatment
of the cells resulted in the abolition of the agonist-mediated
stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production and agonist stimulation
did not lead to any increases in  xxxd208xxx  production. in
addition, the stimulatory eect was not blocked by pertussis
toxin therefore excluding the possibility that adenylyl cyclase is
stimulated by the bg-subunits of activated inhibitory gproteins.
noradrenaline-mediated stimulation of the a2c-adrenoceptor, in the absence of toxin pre-treatment, does not appear to
couple this subtype to either a net stimulation or inhibition of
 xxxd1773xxx  production (present study). however, after the
transfected cho cells had been incubated with pertussis toxin
or cholera toxin to prevent agonist-mediated coupling to gi or
gs, respectively, subsequent  xxxd1773xxx  studies showed
monophasic curves with either a stimulation or inhibition of
 xxxd1773xxx  production. this suggests that in the absence of
toxin pretreatment that the stimulatory and inhibitory eects
at each concentration balance each other out. previous studies
examining the ability of a2c-adrenoceptors, when expressed in
cho cells, to regulate  xxxd1773xxx  production, have produced
biphasic curves which can be dissected into stimulatory and
inhibitory components after toxin treatment of the cells (eason
et al., 1992; eason & liggett, 1993). in these previous studies
the expression levels of the receptor in the cho cells was 5 ± 15
fold greater than in the present study. thus, variations in
receptor expression levels may explain the dierences observed
between the present and previous studies. in addition, the fact
that the a2c-subtype is equally coupled to the inhibition and
stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  production, is consistent with the
british journal of pharmacology, vol 131 (5)

idea that its true physiological role may be to modulate the
eects mediated by the other two a2-adrenoceptor subtypes
(macdonald et al., 1997). however, it should be noted that
when the a2c-adrenoceptor was expressed in cell types such as
chinese hamster lung ®broblasts, jeg-3 cells and  xxxd2715xxx  cells,
the receptor coupled only to the inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx 
production when activated by an agonist (cotecchia et al.,
1990; marjamaèki et al., 1992; pepperl & regan, 1993; jansson
et al., 1994b).
the eects of meta-octopamine are around two orders of
magnitude less potent than those of noradrenaline on both the
a2a- and a2b-adrenoceptors. in contrast, in the case of the a2cadrenoceptor, meta-octopamine is equipotent with noradrenaline at inhibiting  xxxd1773xxx  production and only about one
order of magnitude less potent at stimulating  xxxd1773xxx 
production. in addition, a greater maximal inhibition of cyclic
amp production occurs with meta-octopamine than with
noradrenaline. therefore, the results from the current study,
suggest that meta-octopamine may have a physiological role in
activating the a2c-adrenoceptor. it is interesting to note that
octopamine has also been suggested recently to possibly be an
endogenous physiologically selective b3-adrenoceptor agonist
(carpeâneâ et al., 1999).
the subtype-selective dierences in the modulation of cyclic
amp production observed in the present study, by expressing
the a2-adrenoceptor subtypes at comparable levels in the same
cho cell line, may occur as a result of the conformational
changes adopted by the receptor subtypes upon ligand binding
since there appear to be no signi®cant dierences in agonist
binding anity between the dierent receptor subtypes. the
conserved serine residues in transmembrane v (tmv) of
adrenoceptors have been suggested to be involved in the
interactions with the ring hydroxyl groups of catecholamine
agonists (strader et al., 1989; wang et al., 1991; hwa & perez,
1996; rudling et al., 1999; sato et al., 1999). these serine
residues are separated by three intervening amino acid residues
(cys, ile, gly) in both the human a2a- and a2c-adrenoceptors,
but by only two intervening amino acid residues (ile, gly) in
the human a2b-adrenoceptor, which is similar to the b2adrenoceptor (table 3). this similarity between the a2b- and
b2-adrenoceptors may explain the ability of the a2b-subtype to

the two conserved serine residues located in tmv of all
adrenergic receptors are seperated by three intervening
amino acid residues in both the a2a-adrenergic receptor
and the a2c-adrenergic receptor. in contrast, they are
seperated by only two intervening amino acid residues in
the a2b-adrenergic receptor which is similar to the situation
with the b2-adrenergic receptor.

produce an agonist-induced conformation of the receptor
which strongly couples to the stimulation of forskolinstimulated  xxxd1773xxx  production, in a similar way to the
b2-adrenoceptor. alternatively, the absence of the cysteine
residue in the a2b-subtype, may either allow the receptor to
produce an agonist-induced conformation which facilitates
coupling to gs, or inhibits the eective coupling of the receptor
to gi. wang et al. (1991) have previously suggested that cys201
of the a2a-adrenoceptor may have a role in interacting with the
hydroxyl groups present on the catecholamine ring. further
experimentation is required to resolve this point.
