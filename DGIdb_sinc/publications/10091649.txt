abstract
we have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the complex of lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate
reductase and the anticancer drug  xxxd3442xxx . two thousand seventy distance, 345 dihedral angle, and 144 hydrogen
bond restraints were obtained from analysis of multidimensional nmr spectra recorded for complexes containing
15
n-labeled protein. simulated annealing calculations produced a family of 22 structures fully consistent with the
constraints. several intermolecular protein-ligand noes were obtained by using a novel approach monitoring temperature effects of noe signals resulting from dynamic processes in the bound ligand. at low temperature ~5 8c! the
trimethoxy ring of bound  xxxd3442xxx  is flipping sufficiently slowly to give narrow signals in slow exchange, which give
good noe cross peaks. at higher temperature these broaden and their noe cross peaks disappear thus allowing the
signals in the lower-temperature spectrum to be identified as noes involving ligand protons. the binding site for
 xxxd3442xxx  is well defined and this was compared with the binding sites in related complexes formed with methotrexate
and trimethoprim. no major conformational differences were detected between the different complexes. the 2,4diaminopyrimidine-containing moieties in the three drugs bind essentially in the same binding pocket and the remaining
parts of their molecules adapt their conformations such that they can make effective van der waals interactions with
essentially the same set of hydrophobic amino acids, the side-chain orientations and local conformations of which are
not greatly changed in the different complexes ~similar x1 and x2 values!.

 xxxg631xxx  ~ec 1.5.1.3! catalyzes the reduction of
7,8-dihydrofolate to  xxxd3334xxx  using nadph as co-

enzyme. this reaction maintains the intracellular pool of tetrahydrofolate required by several folate-dependent enzyme systems
involved in important steps in dna synthesis, such as the biosynthesis of purines and the conversion of  xxxd1838xxx  to  xxxd3365xxx  ~blakley, 1985!. the
important cellular role of  xxxg631xxx  has led to it
being used as the target for several clinically useful antifolate
drugs. agents, such as trimethoprim ~antibacterial!, pyrimethamine
~antimalarial!, and methotrexate ~anticancer!, act by inhibiting the
enzyme in parasitic or malignant cells. the relatively small size of
the enzyme ~18–20 kda! makes it amenable to detailed structural
studies ~see reviews by roberts, 1983; freisheim & matthews,
1984; blakley, 1985; feeney, 1986, 1990, 1996; feeney & birdsall, 1993!. these have been carried out on complexes of the
enzyme using both x-ray ~bolin et al., 1982; matthews et al.,

and ionization states in several complexes of  xxxg631xxx  with substrates and inhibitors ~birdsall et al., 1981, 1982,

1996; nieto et al., 1997!.
in the search for improved inhibitors of  xxxg631xxx ,
numerous antifolate analogues have been synthesized and investigated ~roth & cheng, 1982; baccanari & kuyper, 1993!. one promising antifolate analogue is  xxxd3442xxx  ~2,4-diamino-5-methyl-6@~3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino!methyl#quinazoline! ~fig. 1a! ~bertino et
al., 1979!.  xxxd3442xxx  was first prepared by elslager and co-workers
~elslager et al., 1983! and was investigated initially as a potential
antimalarial agent. subsequently, it was found to have antineoplastic activity in relation to breast, head, and neck cancers ~robert, 1988!
and later it was used as an antibacterial in the treatment of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ~pcp! in aids patients ~lin & bertino, 1987!. in 1993  xxxd3442xxx  ~ xxxd3442xxx ! was approved by the
u.s. food and drug administration for the treatment of moderateto-severe pcp in people with compromised immune systems.
the structure of  xxxd3442xxx  ~fig. 1a! combines some of the
features of trimethoprim ~fig. 1b! and methotrexate ~fig. 1c!.
because  xxxd3442xxx  lacks the terminal  xxxd2431xxx  moiety of
methotrexate, it is more lipophilic and does not need active transport for penetration into the cell ~lin & bertino, 1991!. this significantly increases its efficacy against cells resistant to methotrexate.
inhibition studies with the human enzyme show that although
 xxxd3442xxx  is about an order of magnitude less potent than meth-

et al., 1984!.
recent studies on the antipneumocystis activity of  xxxd3442xxx 
have stimulated the synthesis and biological testing of several new
nonclassical antifolates ~gangjee et al., 1996!. gangjee and coworkers have used computer assisted molecular modeling of complexes of  xxxg631xxx  to help in developing novel
antifolates ~gangjee et al., 1995!. such rational drug design studies
could be improved if more structural information were available
for complexes of dihydrofolate reductases and  xxxd3442xxx .
in the present work, we report the high resolution solution structure of the binary complex of lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate
reductase with  xxxd3442xxx . detailed information about the conformation of the bound drug and the structure of its binding site
has been obtained. this information allows us to compare the
binding site with those of methotrexate ~gargaro et al., 1998! and
trimethoprim ~martorell et al., 1994! and to examine any differences in their modes of binding. the dynamics of the protein and
the bound drug and the specific interactions between the enzyme
with the drug have also been characterized.
results
signal assignments for the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex
these assignments for the complex were made by analyzing 2d
1
h nmr spectra of the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex obtained
from cosy, tocsy, noesy, and roesy experiments and 3d
15
n- 1 h nmr spectra from tocsy-hmqc, noesy-hmqc,
roesy-hmqc, and hnhb experiments carried out on uniformly
15
n-labeled dhfr samples using procedures similar to those described earlier for the dhfr{methotrexate complex ~carr et al.,
1991; gargaro et al., 1998!. the 15 n- 1 h hsqc spectrum of the
dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex with all the resonances labeled is
shown in figure 2 and a table containing the 1 h and 15 n signal
assignments is provided in electronic supplementary material.
in earlier studies on the dhfr{methotrexate complex, almost
complete assignments of the proton nmr signals were obtained by
analyzing the 3d and 4d spectra from experiments carried out on
uniformly 15 n and 13 c0 15 n labeled enzyme ~soteriou et al., 1993;
gargaro et al., 1998!. these assignments for the dhfr{methotrexate
complex assisted in the assignment of signals from some of the
long-chain amino acids in the spectra of the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx 
complex, because many signals have similar chemical shifts in the
two complexes and show similar patterns of noes.
coupling constant and distance-related nmr data were used to
derive the stereospecific assignments of b-methylene protons and
of valine g-methyl groups using the program anglesearch as described in materials and methods ~polshakov et al., 1995b!.
signals from all the side-chain amide protons of asparagine and
glutamine residues could easily be assigned in 2d 15 n- 1 h tocsyhmqc and the 3d 15 n- 1 h tocsy-hmqc and noesy-hmqc
spectra by identifying characteristic noe patterns involving the
nh2 amide side-chain protons. the side-chain amide protons hg22
in asparagine and hd22 in glutamine were determined as those
closer to hb protons ~or hg protons in glutamine! than are hg21
or hd21, respectively, and the stereospecific assignments of these
protons could thus be obtained directly from the intensity information in roesy spectra. in the 3d roesy-hmqc spectra, correlations between amide proton of asparagine and glutamine residues
sometimes had different polarities for different residues as a result

of contributions to the intensities from exchange and noe effects
having opposite signs. thus, for q7, q33, n59, q92, and n148,
strong negative cross peaks between hd21 and hd22 ~hg21 and
hg22 for asparagine! were observed indicating that the noe contribution is dominant for these protons. in contrast, for other residues, cross peaks with positive polarity were observed and these
indicated the predominant occurrence of magnetization transfer as
a result of exchange from rotation about the amide bond. for the
former residues, the absence of a large exchange contribution indicates hindered rotation about their amide bonds and these residues were subsequently found to be buried inside the protein or
involved in hydrogen bond formation. in contrast, the side chains
of the remaining asparagine and glutamine residues were found on
the surface of the protein.
at 288 k, the he signals for all eight arginine residues in l.
casei dhfr could be observed in the 3d 15 n-noesy-hmqc and
tocsy-hmqc spectra. these signals have cross peaks to arginine side-chain hd protons in the tocsy spectra. such signals
were assigned by identifying similar patterns of cross peaks in the
3d tocsy-hmqc spectrum from the he proton compared with
cross peaks in the 3d 15 n- 1 h noesy-hmqc spectrum connected
to the backbone amide nh signals of arginine residues.

assignment of ligand signals
the signals in the 1 h spectrum of uncomplexed  xxxd3442xxx  in
h2o solution were assigned on the basis of their characteristic
chemical shifts, intensities, multiplicities, and intramolecular noes
~see table 2!. the 1 h chemical shifts were measured as a function
of ph ~over the range 4.8 to 9.3!, confirming that the site of
protonation on the quinazoline ring of  xxxd3442xxx  is at n1 with a
pka of 7.93 6 0.03. in the 1 h spectrum of the complex recorded
in h 2o at 288 k, a signal detected at 15.46 ppm could be assigned
to the  xxxg1580xxx  proton of the quinazoline ring of protonated bound
 xxxd3442xxx  on the basis of the build-up of large intramolecular
noes to the hn21 and h8 and smaller noes to the hn22 and h7
protons. similar low field signals have been observed for the  xxxg1580xxx 
protons of bound methotrexate ~16.85 ppm! ~gargaro et al., 1998!
and trimethoprim ~14.9 ppm! ~martorell et al., 1994!. correlations
between h7 and h8 and between hn21 and hn22 were detected
in the cosy spectrum, thus confirming these assignments. other
signals in bound  xxxd3442xxx  were assigned on the basis of their
intramolecular noes, and cosy and tocsy connections.
the assignments of the ch3-39,59 and h-29,69 protons from the
trimethoxybenzyl ring of bound  xxxd3442xxx  were made by noting

variations in linewidth resulting from changes in rates of ring
flipping with temperature in their 2d and 1d spectra measured as
a function of temperature. part of the 1 h roesy spectrum recorded at 288 k showing the exchange cross peaks ~in boxes!
connecting the exchanging h29 and h69, and ch 3-39 and ch 3-59
protons is presented in figure 3a. the exchange is caused by ring
flipping and the signals are readily detectable in the roesy spectrum because they have opposite signs to other cross peaks that
arise from dipolar relaxation interactions. in the 1 h noesy spectrum recorded at low temperature ~278 k! shown in figure 3b, the
exchange cross peaks between the h29 and h69 protons are still
detected although with lower intensity. examination of figure 3b
indicates that it is relatively easy to detect the additional noe
cross peaks that appear when the lines become narrower on lowering the temperature where the slower ring-flipping results in the
signals from the ring protons being in slow exchange. this proved
to be a very effective method for identifying both inter- and intramolecular noes involving the exchanging protons ~see below!.
the anglesearch program was used to determine the stereospecific assignments of methylene protons at position 9 in  xxxd3442xxx . intramolecular roesy intensities were used in the anglesearch

a

calculations. because there is no chiral center in the  xxxd3442xxx 
molecule, the stereospecific assignments of the ch2-9 protons in
bound  xxxd3442xxx  have been made in a manner similar to that
described for glycine residues in the methotrexate{dhfr complex
~polshakov et al., 1995b!. for the two alternative assignments of
the methylene ch2-9 protons, ranges of t1 and t2 torsion angles
were obtained from anglesearch calculations and the correct assignment selected by comparison of these angles with the torsion
angles found in the families of nmr structures calculated without
using restraints on these torsion angles. this led to the determination of both the stereospecific assignments of the methylene ch2-9
protons and the allowed ranges of torsion angles t1 ~c5-c6-c9n10! and t2 ~c6-c9-n10-c19! in bound  xxxd3442xxx . these constraints were used in the final stage of structure calculations
~1708 6 308 for t1 and 908 6 308 for t2 !.

assignment of protein-ligand noes
once the assignment of the protein and ligand signals had been
completed, most protein-ligand noes ~fig. 4! could be assigned

the signals marked by boxes are the exchange peaks between h-29 and h-69 and between ch3-39 and ch3-59, which can be identified
in the roesy spectrum by their positive polarity. in the noesy spectrum recorded at 278 k, the signals of the exchanging protons
are much sharper than those in the higher temperature spectrum and allow detection of noes involving protein signals.

some of the important protein side chains and the ligand in its
binding site. the structures of bound  xxxd3442xxx  are shown in
figure 5c. all the structures shown in figures 5a–c are presented
in the same orientation. some indication of the precision of the
structures can be realized by noting how well the different calculated structures are superimposed ~pairwise rmsd is 0.5 å for
backbone atoms and 1.0 å for all heavy atoms!. the absence of
dihedral angle and noe violations and the small energies for the
experimental constraints ~see table 1! provide further evidence for
the precision of the structures. from an examination of the structure ~fig. 5a! and the procheck analysis ~laskowski et al.,
1993, 1996! of the data, the general features of the structure are
seen to be essentially identical to the overall structural features
found in the solution structure of dhfr{methotrexate ~gargaro
et al., 1998! and in the crystal structures of dhfr{methotrexate.

in most cases ligand noe partners could be assigned unambiguously because of their unique chemical shifts or characteristic line
shapes. signals from the 29,69-ring protons and the 39,59-methoxy
protons of the trimethoxyphenyl ring could be uniquely identified
because of their changes in line shape with temperature: decrease
of temperature caused these signals to become sharper due to
slower ring flipping whereas most of the protein signals became
broader. this ability to manipulate the detection of noes by raising or lowering the temperature greatly facilitated the detection of
the protein-ligand noes. furthermore, the availability of noes
involving resolved protons from opposite sides of the ring increases the total number of detected noes. the method has general applicability in cases where there is an intramolecular rate
process that can influence the line width of the ligand signals
differently as the temperature is changed. in some cases, protein
partners in protein-ligand noes were also assigned by identifying
their characteristic set of noes ~for example, the  xxxd3442xxx  h8
proton has noes to several protons of l27—ha, hg, hd1, and
hd2!. for assignment of the remaining noes, the ambiguities
were resolved in an iterative manner during the refinement stage of
the structure calculation. a summary of the extensive number of
intermolecular noes between  xxxd3442xxx  and protein protons is
given in figure 4.
structure of the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex
the structures shown in figure 5 are from the final 22 calculated
structures superimposed on the backbone of the representative struc-

the overall rotational correlation time tc for the complex of dhfr
with  xxxd3442xxx  was calculated from the 15 n t1 and t2 data using
procedures developed by kay et al. ~1989!. t1 and t2 values were
obtained from a total of 128 residues. local values of the overall
correlation time were calculated from the t1 0t2 ratios of 54 of the
residues ~see materials and methods!; the average of these values
gives an overall correlation time of 8.75 6 0.1 ns at 308 k.
the experimental values of the relaxation parameters were interpreted using the model-free formalism ~lipari & szabo, 1982!,
with extensions to include slower internal motions ~clore et al.,
1990b! and chemical exchange contributions rex to the transverse
relaxation ~clore et al., 1990a! ~see electronic supplementary
material!.
values of the model-free parameters s 2 , te , and rex have been
obtained for all 128 residues for which experimental relaxation
data were obtained.
figure 6 shows the measured values of the relaxation parameters
r1 , r2 , and noe ~ri 5 ti21 ! and the calculated generalized order
parameters, s 2 , plotted against the corresponding residue number.
the te and rex values are given in electronic supplementary material.
ring flipping in bound  xxxd3442xxx 
ring flipping of the 39,49,59-trimethoxyphenyl ring of bound  xxxd3442xxx  has been studied using 2d roesy and 1d nmr- 1 h
spectra of the complex recorded over the temperature range 278 to
313 k. in the 2d roesy ~and 2d noesy! spectra, one can
observe strong exchange cross peaks between h29 and h69 and
between ch 3-39 and ch 3-59 ~fig. 3!. decreasing the temperature
reduces the intensities of these cross peaks and at the same time
sharpens the signals. this is typical for slow exchange behavior
where separate signals are detected for the exchanging sites and
the line widths of the signals have contributions from the exchange process. this dynamic process has been investigated by
line shape analysis of the h69 signal in the 1d spectrum of the
dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex. this signal is observed as a wellresolved signal in a noncrowded region of the 1 h spectrum ~fig. 7!
and this facilitates measurement of its lineshape. an approximate
estimate of the nonexchange contribution to the linewidth was
obtained from the mean values of the linewidths of several histi-

discussion
the solution structure of the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex
some indication of the precision of the determined structures is
provided by figure 5, which shows the superposition of the final

family of 22 structures, and by the plot of the rmsd values
against the residue numbers shown in figure 8. the precision of
the structures compares very favorably with that of the structures
reported earlier for the dhfr{methotrexate complex ~gargaro
et al., 1998!. the latter determination was based on nmr studies
of 13 c0 15 n labeled methotrexate and protein samples. the structure determination for the  xxxd3442xxx  complex was carried out
using unlabeled  xxxd3442xxx  and only 15 n-labeled protein. notwithstanding this, the number of ligand-protein noes assigned for
the  xxxd3442xxx  complex ~67! was greater than the number obtained for the methotrexate complex ~54!. the methyl substituted
quinazoline ring of the bound  xxxd3442xxx  has more protons than

the corresponding pteridine ring of methotrexate and these protons
provide increased opportunities for measuring protein-ligand noes.
additionally, the favorable dynamic behavior of the trimethoxy
ring of  xxxd3442xxx  allows the measurement of unambiguous noes

chemical shift measured at 288 k.

from protons on each side of the ring at low temperature ~278 k!.
at this temperature the ring flipping is sufficiently slow to allow
the h29, h69 and ch3-39,ch3-59 protons to give separate signals in
slow exchange and to allow detection of protein-ligand noes in
the noesy spectra. these noes can be assigned to protein-ligand
noes by noting their disappearance on raising the temperature
where the increased rate of ring flipping broadens the ligand signals. in contrast, the flipping rates of the p-aminobenzoyl ring of
methotrexate causes line broadening of its aromatic proton signals
such that no signals could be detected at any of the temperatures
studied. the low temperature spectra of the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx 
complex also allowed us to make specific noe assignments for
the separate protons in the  xxxd3442xxx  nh2 groups. a further
improvement in the structure determination of the  xxxd3442xxx 
complex resulted from the use of many more noes involving
stereospecifically assigned protons and more hydrogen bonds than
were used in the methotrexate structure calculations. although
18% fewer intramolecular noes were used in the calculations for
the  xxxd3442xxx  complex ~resulting from the absence of some hbs0
hbs, hgs0hbs assignments, which could only be obtained from
13
c data!, the compensating factors mentioned above result in the
determined structures of the two complexes being of similar precision. the availability of the spectral and structural data for the
methotrexate complex assisted in the structural determination of
the  xxxd3442xxx  complex. high precision structures for proteins of
this size can thus be obtained without using 13 c-labeled protein if
one has a reference structure to assist in obtaining the initial set of
noe values ~see material and methods!.

mages 1 and 2 in electronic supplementary material!. it is seen that
the inhibitors occupy approximately the same space within the
protein and consequently interact with many of the same residues.
although the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-containing rings occupy essentially the same binding site, the planes of the rings appear to be
tilted by 208 with respect to each other ~with the  xxxd3442xxx 
structure being in the middle!. the trimethoxy benzene ring of
bound  xxxd3442xxx  is perpendicular to that of trimethoprim.
the binding site residues in complexes of  xxxg631xxx  with methotrexate and trimethoprim have been well described
in the literature ~bolin et al., 1982; matthews et al., 1985a; martorell et al., 1994; gargaro et al., 1998!. in each case, the 2,4diaminopyrimidine ring moiety binds in a very negatively charged
pocket involving the side-chain carboxylate group of d26, the
hydroxyl group of t116, and the backbone carbonyl groups of l4
and a97. in the methotrexate complex, there are additional electrostatic interactions involving the carboxylate groups of the methotrexate glutamate side chain with h28 and r57. the “middle”
part of the methotrexate molecule binds in a pocket containing
several hydrophobic amino acids ~fig. 9a! and many of the same
residues are involved in binding the trimethoxy ring of trimetho-

prim ~fig. 9b! ~matthews et al., 1985a; martorell et al., 1994!. the
structure of the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex reported here allows
us to compare its protein-ligand interactions with those found in
the methotrexate and trimethoprim complexes examined previously ~martorell et al., 1994; gargaro et al., 1998!. these comparisons need to be made with caution because not all parts of the
structure are equally well defined. however, figure 8a shows that
the regions of the protein with the smallest and largest rmsd
values for the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex are very similar to
those previously reported for the dhfr{methotrexate structure
~see fig. 5 of gargaro et al., 1998!.
comparison of dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  and
dhfr{methotrexate structures
the global structure of the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex ~see
figs. 5, 8, 9! is found to be very similar to that of the
dhfr{methotrexate complex with the small differences between

the structures being localized mainly to regions around the binding
site. this is seen from examination of the rmsd values resulting
from the pairwise global fitting of the backbone atoms ~c, ca, and
n! of the two families of structures for the dhfr complexes with
 xxxd3442xxx  and methotrexate ~fig. 8!. the residues with the largest backbone displacements are in the regions 6–10, 25–31, 72–73,
114–117, and 124–155. the 6–10, 25–31, and 114–117 regions
can obviously be implicated in differences between the ligand
binding sites as can the 150–155 region, which is on the adjacent
b-strand to the 6–10 and 114–117 regions. differences in the
72–73 region may reflect some uncertainties in the determination
of the structure of the loop containing these residues.
the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine ring of each inhibitor binds similarly to the enzyme. in each case the protonated n1 binds to the
side-chain carboxylate group of d26 ~fig. 5b! and the 2- and
4-amino substituents are positioned to make interactions with
t116, l4, and a97 as described earlier ~bolin et al., 1982; gargaro
et al., 1998!. the side chains involved in binding to the 2,4-

476

v.i. polshakov et al.
hibitors. for the  xxxd3442xxx  complex, these residues are  xxxg1979xxx ,
l27, f30, f49, p50, l54, and a97 while for the methotrexate
complex the side chains of the same residues, except for a97 ~not
shown in the figure!, can be involved in the binding. the positions
of the side chains of the interacting hydrophobic residues have not
changed substantially between the two different complexes. this
can be seen by examining figure 9a and is supported by the
observed small values for the rmsd quotients ~fig. 8c! and the
fact that all the residues have very similar measured x1 and x2
values in both complexes ~see table 3!. some small differences
were seen for l27, f49, and l54 with the largest difference being
seen for the l27 x1 value ~178!. thus, the drugs are adapting their
bound conformations to interact with the same hydrophobic amino
acid side chains, which bind in general with relatively unchanged
x1 0x2 conformations. the small changes in the positions of the
interacting side chains in the two complexes ~fig. 9a! must be
achieved by the sum of many small relative differences in the
backbones of the two complexes.

2,4-diaminopyrimidine rings are displayed perpendicular to the plane of the

diaminopyrimidine moiety in each complex are in essentially the
same positions in the two complexes indicating that this part of the
molecule is binding in the same binding site.
figure 9a shows some of the important hydrophobic side chains,
which can be involved in van der waals interaction with the in-

although the structures determined for the dhfr{trimethoprim
complex ~martorell et al., 1994! are of lower precision than those
of the  xxxd3442xxx  complex useful structural comparisons are still
possible.
the structures of the binding sites in the two complexes are
shown in figure 9b. the  xxxd3442xxx  hydrophobic binding pocket
is seen to contain  xxxg1979xxx , l27, f30, f49, p50, l54, and a97 and that
for trimethoprim contains the same residues except for a97. in the
 xxxd3442xxx  complex, the hydrophobic residues  xxxg1979xxx  and f30 interact with the quinazoline b ring whereas in the trimethoprim
complex, where this ring is missing, these residues can interact
with the trimethoxy ring. although the rings are in different positions in the binding sites of the two complexes, in each case, the
side chains of l27 and f49 are sufficiently close to interact with
the trimethoxy ring and substituents. the side chains of residues
p50 and l54 also could provide some additional interactions in the
 xxxd3442xxx  complex but these will be smaller in the trimethoprim
complex. a97 is correctly positioned to interact with the c5 methyl
of bound  xxxd3442xxx , which has no equivalent in trimethoprim.

structure and dynamics in solution of the complex of l. casei
conformations of the interacting hydrophobic side chains in the
protein are not very different. thus, once again, effective proteinligand interactions are formed by the drug adopting a bound conformation which takes advantage of the existing conformations of
the interacting side chains of the protein.
relaxation parameters
the measured values of the 15 n relaxation parameters ~t1 , t2 , and
noe! and the calculated generalized order parameter ~s 2 ! plotted
against the corresponding residue number are shown in figure 6.
the protein in the dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complex appears to have no
really flexible parts: the only residue showing high flexibility is the
c-terminal a162. thus, the data indicate that dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx 
complex is globular ~average tc value of 8.75 6 0.1 ns!, which is
in good agreement with the determined structure. the mean value
obtained for s 2 is 0.86 and the standard deviation is 0.05. there are
several residues with s 2 values below the mean value minus one
standard deviation, namely, residues 68–71, 102, 110, 122, 131,
133, 145, 146, 155, 161, and 162. most of these are near to the
unoccupied binding site of the coenzyme or are situated in loop
regions.
ring flipping in bound  xxxd3442xxx 
the nonlinear fitting of the experimental kinetic data for the  xxxd3442xxx  ring flipping provides the values: dh ‡ 5 62.0 6 2.0 kj
mol 21 and ds ‡ 5 25 6 10 j mol 21 k 21 . interestingly, the value
of ds ‡ is rather close to the values obtained for ring flipping in
39,59-difluoromethotrexate bound to l. casei dhfr ~215 j mol 21
k 21 for binary and 229 j mol 21 k 21 for the ternary complex with
nadph! ~clore et al., 1984!. however, the enthalpy value for ring
flipping of  xxxd3442xxx  is much higher than the values found for
39,59-difluoromethotrexate ~dh ‡ 5 48.1 kj mol 21 for the binary
and 41.4 kj mol 21 for the ternary complex!. there are two components in the value of dh ‡ : the intrinsic barrier to rotation about
the n10-c19 bond and an additional barrier due to interactions of
the benzoyl ring with protein residues including any conformational rearrangements required to relieve steric interactions hindering the ring flipping. for  xxxd3442xxx , the intrinsic barrier to
rotation would be expected to be less than that for methotrexate,
where the intrinsic barrier includes the effects of hindered rotation
about the amide bond to the glutamate moiety. therefore, a substantial contribution to the value of dh ‡ ~62 kj mol 21 ! in the
 xxxd3442xxx  complex arises from the additional barrier. because
the structures of the ligand binding sites are fairly similar in the
complexes formed with each of the drugs, the difference in the
dh ‡ values for complexes of dhfr with  xxxd3442xxx  and with
39,59-diflouromethotrexate probably reflects additional hydrophobic interactions of the 39,49,59-trimethoxyphenyl ring of  xxxd3442xxx  with residues in the active site. these interactions would need
to be broken before ring flipping can take place, thus contributing to the activation barrier ~estimated contribution of 10 to 15
kj mol 21 , that is, the difference 62 2 48 kj mol 21 !.
materials and methods
sample preparation
l. casei  xxxg631xxx  was prepared as described previously from an escherichia coli strain in which the structural gene

for the l. casei enzyme had been cloned ~dann et al., 1976; andrews et al., 1985!.  xxxd3442xxx  was a gift from warner-lambert0
parke-davis ~pontypool, gwent!. just over one equivalent of
 xxxd3442xxx  was added as a solid to the solution of dihydrofolate
reductase: after 3–10 h standing, undissolved  xxxd3442xxx  was
separated by centrifugation and the final solution dialyzed to remove uncomplexed  xxxd3442xxx .

binding data
methotrexate and  xxxd3442xxx  bind very tightly to dhfr, which
makes direct measurement of the binding constant difficult.
however, the ratios of the binding constants kamtx 0katmq and
katmq 0katmp can be estimated from competition experiments. a
sample containing a 1:1:1 mixture of dhfr, mtx, and  xxxd3442xxx  was
made at ph 6.5 in 500 mm kcl and 50 mm potassium phosphate
and examined after 2 and 7 days to confirm that complete equilibrium had been reached. at equilibrium, the ratio kamtx 0katmq
equals $@dhfr{mtx#0@dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx #%{$@ xxxd3442xxx #0@mtx#%. defining h as the ratio @dhfr{mtx#0@dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx #, and assuming
that @dhfr free # ; 0, which is a good assumption for tightlybinding ligands, it can be shown that for 1:1:1 mixture of dhfr,
mtx, and  xxxd3442xxx , ratio @ xxxd3442xxx #0@mtx# can be approximated to h,
and therefore kamtx 0katmq 5 h 2 . the ratio h was obtained from
the integrated areas of well-resolved complex-specific signals in
the 1d 1 h spectra of the complexes. the ratio of binding constants
kamtx 0katmq is 20 6 10. a similar experiment carried out on a
sample containing a 1:1:1 mixture of dhfr, tmp, and  xxxd3442xxx  gave
the ratio of binding constants, katmq 0katmp 5 10 6 5. katmq can
then be estimated as ;2 3 10 8 m 21 using the previously reported
values for kamtx ~2 3 10 9 m 21 ! and katmp ~2 3 10 7 m 21 !
~birdsall et al., 1980!.

nmr experiments
the nmr experiments were carried out on varian unity and
unity plus spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of
600 and 500 mhz, respectively. the spectra were recorded at
278, 288, or 308 k on either unlabeled or 15 n-labeled protein
samples with volumes of 0.6 ml and at concentrations 1 or
4 mm in 500 mm  xxxd2988xxx  and 50 mm potassium
phosphate buffer, ph* 6.5, made up either in d2o or in 90%
h2o010% d2o ~ph* values are ph meter readings uncorrected
for deuterium isotope effects!.
full details of the nmr experiments are provided in electronic
supplementary material. 2d dqf-cosy, tocsy, noesy, and
roesy spectra were recorded at temperatures between 278 and
308 k for both h2o and d2o samples of dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx . 2d
and 3d experiments using uniformly 15 n labeled protein, hsqc,
tocsy-hmqc, noesy-hmqc, roesy-hmqc, and hnhb
were also carried out. longitudinal and transverse 15 n relaxation
times ~t1 and t2 ! and 15 n$ 1 h%noe values were measured at 308 k
using the pulse sequences described by kay and co-workers ~1992!.
the 1 h chemical shifts were measured from dioxane as an internal
reference and then referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane5-sulfonate ~dss!, relative to which the chemical shift of dioxane
is 3.75 ppm. the 15 n chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to
liquid nh3 using the g ratios method ~live et al., 1984; wishart
et al., 1996!.

478
nmr determined constraints
distance constraints
interproton distance constraints were obtained from noes measured in 2d and 3d noesy and roesy spectra recorded in d2o
and h2o. the set of distance constraints used for generation of
initial structures contained unambiguously assigned noes, and
also a limited set of noes for which the ambiguity was resolved
using the nmr structures of the dhfr{mtx complex ~gargaro
et al., 1998!. the total number of noes used for initial structure
generation was about 900. when the initial structures were being
generated, assignments of additional noes were carried out in the
usual iterative manner. cross-peak intensities were classified as
strong ~0.0–2.5 å!, medium ~0.0–3.5 å!, weak ~0.0–4.5 å!, and
very weak ~0.0–5.5 å!. pseudoatom center averaging was applied
for methyl groups and all distance constraints based on noes
involving methyl groups had their upper limits increased by 1 å.
an r 26 sum averaging, where the r 26 distance was weighted by
the number of ambiguous noes ~nilges, 1995!, was applied for all
nonstereospecifically assigned pairs of methyl groups, all nonstereospecifically assigned protons in methylene groups and for the
hd and he protons in phenylalanine and tyrosine rings.
the number and distribution of noes used in the structural
calculations are given in table 1 ~and illustrated in fig. 2 of electronic supplementary material!. the final restraint list contained
2,070 noes. no intraresidue noes between atoms separated by
three bonds ~e.g., hn-ha, ha-hb! were included in the x-plor
calculations because these ~about 430 noes! had already been
used for defining the torsion angles in the anglesearch calculations.
torsion angle constraints and stereospecific assignments
the program anglesearch ~polshakov et al., 1995b! was used
to determine the f, c, x1 , and x2 torsional angle constraints and
the stereospecific assignments for all the b-methylene protons
and for valine g-methyl groups as described previously for the
dhfr{methotrexate complex ~gargaro et al., 1998!. the error
limits obtained from anglesearch for the dihedral angles were
increased to 6308 for f, 6408 for c, and 6308 and 6408 for x1
and x2 , respectively, to take into account local mobilities and the
uncertainties in the karplus equations used in these studies.
the ranges for the  xxxd3442xxx  torsion angles t1 ~c5-c6-c9n10! and t2 ~c6-c9-n10-c19! were determined from the anglesearch analysis of roesy effects between protons of the drug.
the final restraint list contained 345 dihedral angles ~f, 123; c,
120; x1 , 96; x2 , 4;  xxxd3442xxx , 2!.
hydrogen bond constraints
hydrogen bond constraints involving backbone nh protons
were included in the calculation only at the last stage of structure
refinement after they had been identified in the family of structures
obtained without their use. donors of hydrogen bonds corresponding to slowly exchanging nh protons were identified from
analysis of the rates of h r d exchange for backbone amide
protons ~measured at 288 k from a series of hsqc spectra of
dhfr{ xxxd3442xxx  complexes recorded between 5 and 880 min
after dissolving the sample in d2o as described in electronic supplementary material!. acceptors of hydrogen bonds were selected
if there were only one possible oxygen atom within 3 å distance
of the corresponding amide proton in the family of structures and

v.i. polshakov et al.
each hydrogen bond was described with two restraints. the final
calculations included 142 hydrogen bond restraints involving backbone nh protons ~corresponding to 71 hydrogen bonds!.
a hydrogen bond restraint corresponding to the t34 g-hydroxyl
proton interacting with the carbonyl oxygen of f30 was included
in the structure calculation. a signal for the t34 g-hydroxyl proton
was observed in all nmr spectra recorded in h2o and was also
observed for the dhfr{methotrexate complex ~gargaro et al.,
1998!.
to specify the geometry of the interactions of the  xxxd3442xxx 
 xxxg1580xxx  and hn21 protons with the d26 b-carboxylate oxygens
~polshakov et al., 1995a!, two distance restraints and four additional torsion angles were included in the final stage of structure
calculation to maintain the planarity of the 2-nh2 group and the
pyrimidine ring.
the final constraint list contained a total of 144 hydrogen bond
constraints.
structure calculations
the structure calculations were performed in an iterative fashion
using x-plor 3.1 ~brünger, 1992!. initially, a set of 100 structures was generated using a combined distance geometry0simulated
annealing approach ~nilges et al., 1988, 1991!. the distance geometry used subembedding based on the ca, ha, n, hn, o, c,
and cb atoms. the ligand was included from the beginning of the
calculations. structures produced by this method were then regularized using simulated annealing consisting of 6 ps of dynamics at
2,000 k with the force constants determining covalent geometry
scaled during this stage to their final values, followed by cooling
to 100 k with the vdw repulsive term increased from 0.003 to 0.4
and the vdw radii decreased from 0.9 to 0.8 of their standard
values and then subjected to 1,000 steps of conjugate gradient
minimization. fifty-four of the structures with essentially the correct fold as judged by comparison with nmr structures of the
dhfr{methotrexate complex ~gargaro et al., 1998! were accepted
for further refinement. these structures were used to resolve ambiguities in the noe data set and then subjected to a slow cooling
simulated annealing refinement ~from 1000 to 100 k during a
20 ps period!. this stage of the process was repeated several times
including progressively more noe and dihedral angle constraints.
twenty-four structures with no noe violations greater than 0.2 å
and no dihedral angle violations greater than 58 were accepted
for the final refinement. at this stage, the hydrogen bonds and
the constraints modeling specific interactions between 2,4diaminopyrimidyl moiety of  xxxd3442xxx  and the  xxxd2154xxx  of
d26 were introduced. the final refinement protocol was essentially the same as the previous one followed by 1,000 steps of
conjugate gradient minimization and yielded 22 structures with no
distance violation greater then 0.1 å and no dihedral angle violations greater than 38. calculations of the final family of 22 structures ~shown in fig. 5! were carried out with double the earlier
cooling md period ~40 ps!. figure 8a shows the rmsd values
calculated for the backbone atoms ~ca, c, n! using pairwise global fitting of these 22 structures. bond lengths were constrained
using shake ~ryckaert et al., 1977!. parameter and topology
files for  xxxd3442xxx  were constructed using coordinates from the
crystal structure of  xxxd3442xxx  ~hempel & camerman, 1988!.
calculations were performed on silicon graphics ~power indigo2! and sun ~sparc 10! computers. coordinates for the 22 refined
structures have been deposited in the brookhaven protein data

ensemble of calculated structures as being the one that is closest to
all the other structures and thus gives the lowest sum of pairwise
rmsd for the remainder of the structures in the family. rmsd
i
parameters ~rtmq
! for both side chain and all heavy atoms of each
residue i have been calculated together with their standard deviations. similar calculations were performed for the family of 21
calculated structures of the complex of mtx ~gargaro et al., 1998!.
for comparison of solution structures of mtx and  xxxd3442xxx , similar
parameters were also obtained using cross-pairwise superimposition of each structure of mtx on each structure of  xxxd3442xxx  in their
families ~462 pairs!. for comparison of two families, a parameter
i
i
i
r i 5 ~rtmq0mtx
! 20~rtmq
{rmtx
! was calculated. this parameter
is especially useful when one is comparing results for superimposition on all heavy atoms. for example, residues with ill-defined
i
i
side-chain conformations have large values of rtmq0mtx
, r  xxxd3442xxx 
,
i
i
and rmtx , and the values of r will be closer to 1. however,
residues that have well-defined side chains within families but that
have large differences between two complexes will have large
values of r i ~see fig. 8!. in figure 8c, only a-helix b ~between
residues 26 and 28! shows a significant local displacement between the two dhfr complexes probably due to the interaction
between h28 and the glutamate moiety of methotrexate, which is
absent in the  xxxd3442xxx  complex.
t1 , t2 and

15

n{ 1 h} noe data analysis

the relaxation data were analyzed using the “model-free” approach of lipari and szabo ~1982! with the assumption of isotropic
tumbling. the spectra used in the t1 , t2 , and 15 n$ 1 h% noe experiments were processed and analyzed with the felix program
~molecular simulations inc.!. the time domain data were zerofilled to 1k and 2k complex points in the t1 and t2 dimensions, and
a gaussian window function was applied in both dimensions before transformation. the t1 and t2 values ~giving the rates r1 and
r2 , respectively! and their standard deviations were obtained from
nonlinear fits of both integral peak volumes and the peak intensities. standard deviations of 15 n$ 1 h% noe values were calculated
using the rms noise of background regions ~farrow et al., 1994!.
for most of the residues, the results were identical, but for the
residues with signals situated in more crowded regions the results
obtained from peak intensities ~rather than from volumes! had
smaller standard deviations, and therefore only these were used for
further analysis ~results shown in fig. 6!. t1 and t2 values were
obtained from a total of 128 residues.
the overall correlation time tc for the complex of dhfr with
 xxxd3442xxx  was calculated from the t1 0t2 ratios ~kay et al., 1989!.
an initial selection was made of residues that had t1 and t2 values
within one standard deviation from the mean values over all residues ~93 of 128 residues!. of these, the 54 residues that had t1 0t2

ratios within one standard deviation of the mean of the subset of 93
were then selected for further analysis. the calculations yield an
average tc value of 8.75 6 0.1 ns. the overall correlation time was
treated as a fixed parameter in the analysis of the relaxation data in
terms of the model-free formalism.
calculation of the model-free parameters from the measured
relaxation rate constants and the noe enhancements was performed by powell minimization ~press et al., 1992! of a global
target function x 2 summed over all residues using software written
in-house ~see electronic supplementary material!. in this analysis,
15
n- 1 h dipolar relaxation and 15 n csa relaxation were examined
using equations in the literature ~kay et al., 1989; farrow et al.,
1994!. values of 1.02 å and 160 ppm were assumed for the n-h
bond-length and 15 n csa, respectively. for some residues, an
exchange term rex was included to represent line broadening due
to exchange processes on a timescale much slower than the overall
rotational correlation time.
the relaxation data were fitted to three functional forms of the
model free spectral density functions given in the literature ~lipari
& szabo, 1982; clore et al., 1990a, 1990b! and described in electronic supplementary material.
