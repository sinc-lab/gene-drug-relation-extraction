flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepinc. is the first benzodiazepine antagonist available for clinical use. i( is a
specific competitive antagonist at benzodiazepine receptors, which are associated with receptors for gammaaminohutyric acid, the most irnportant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. administered
orally-, it has a low hioavailability and the preferred route is intravenous. its usual clinical role is to reverse the
effects of benzodiazepine sedation; however, administered before, or with, other benzodiazepines, it modifies
their effects, the extent of such modification depending on the dose, duration of effect and relative receptor
affinity of the agonist. flumazenil also reverses adverse physiological effects of benzodiazepines. its indications
includr reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation, termination of benzodiazepine-induced anaesthesia. return
of spontaneous respiration and consciousness in intensive care patients and the treatment of paradoxical reactions
to benzodiazepines. other potential indications include its use in hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol intoxication
and coma; however. these claims still require substantiation. following sedation reversed with flumazenil, minimal
residual effects of the agonist can sometimes be detected using psychomotor tests and are due to the relatively
short half-life of flumazenil, but are of no clinical consequence. there is concern that flumazenil could precipitate
an acute withdrawal syndrome following long-term benzodiazepine administration; however, the available rvidence suggests otherwise and that it could be useful in the treatment of benzodiazepine tolerance. the existence
of flumazenil is important, with implications for future research and the development of minimally invasive
therapy and day-case surgery. with increasing pressures on non-anaesthetically trained practitioners to prrform
sedation, flumazenil has important implications for safety

hlechanzsm of action
benzodiazepines exert their action by specific, high affinity binding to the receptor (2, 3) being a part of the
gaba (y-amino-butyric-acid) receptor (4-9). gaba is
the most important neurotransmitter in the cns.

gaba receptors
in the central nervous system, two principal gaba regaba,, receptors,
ceptor types have been described
which function as gated c1- channels, and gabab receptors, which act via k + and ca++ channels. their
putative function has been reviewed (10) and they have
been fully classified relatively recently (1 i ) .

fig. 1. structure and principal metabolites of flumazenil.

gabaa receptors of the vertebrate nervous system
are ligand-gated c1- ion channels modulated by binding
sites for a wide variety of drugs. gaba is the major
and most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
mammalian central nervous system (cns) and most
neurones in the brain undergo gabaergic modulation.
the facilitation of the entry of c1- ions into the cells
induces hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic membrane causing inhibition of neuronal activity. similarities
between the pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors and gabaa
receptors suggest that the latter is also pentameric and
is part of a family of ion-gated channels (12).

genetics and receptor subgpes of gabaa receptors
four different types of subunit have been identified 6a, 4p, 3y, 16 in the brain, and 2q, which are found
only in the retina. the basic receptor molecule involved
in  xxxd1459xxx  activity probably comprises 2a, 2p and ly subunits.
there is a good correlation between radiolabelled
flunitrazepam binding, which is incorporated only into
the 01 and y subunits, and  xxxd1459xxx  activity (13). since y,
and y2 are mutually exclusive, it seems that there may
be only one  xxxd1459xxx  site on each receptor molecule (14). so
far, at least two different gabaa receptors containing
distinct  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites ( xxxd367xxx  and bz,) have been
identified (13).
the binding process is complex. for example, flumazenil has an affinity for receptors with the configuration
a1,p2, y2 200 times greater than that for those receptors
containing the absubunit. in contrast, the partial inverse
agonist ro 15-4513 has equal affinity for both a , and
a, receptor types, and the difference in the selectivity of
binding by these two molecules, which are chemically
very similar, is remarkable (14).

ation, sedative and hypnotic properties, many other molecules bind to the family of gabaareceptors. examples
of these include p carbolines (anxiogenic or convulsant),
barbiturates (depressant), anaesthetic agents (e.g. propofol, etomidate, alfaxolone), a variety of steroids with
anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and hypnotic properties,
ethanol, chlormethiazole, convulsants @icrotoxin,bicuculline), avermectin and zinc ions (zn2+)(13).
in addition, gaba has been identified in approximately 30 peripheral tissues, and both gabaa and
gaba, subtypes have been identified in various peripheral organs (15). these peripheral gaba receptors are
localized on the outer mitochondria1 membranes in
many tissues and are regarded as unrelated and pharmacologically distinct from, for example, central gabaa
receptor-associated  xxxd1459xxx  binding sites (12).

7 h e bentodiaqbine receptor (bzr) and its ligands
the bzr is an integral binding site on the gabaareceptor complex, located at some distance from the
gaba binding site and mediating allostenc modulation
(16) whereby the allosteric modulation induces a conformational change of its binding protein (17). this change
is transmitted intramolecularly to the gaba binding
sites and the binding site alters the affinity for gaba.
alternatively, the change may be transmitted to other
elements of the gaba/ xxxd1459xxx  complex which facilitate or

depress the conformational transition of the channcl i.e.
the channel gatings, induced by gaba (16).
although all benzodiazepines and related drugs such
as zopiclone and zolpidem, flumazenil and p-carbolines
bind to the benzodiazepine receptor, the effect they induce is rather different. classical benzodiazepine
agoniats such as diazepam, midazolam and alprazolam
exert anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, sedative and hypnotic effects.
ligands that bind to these receptors with the opposite
effect to such  xxxd1459xxx  agonists - to decrease the c1 flux
are called
and cause anxiety, arousal and convulsions
inverse agonistc [e.g. methyl p-carboline carboxylate
(pccm)] (1 8-20) or anxiety peptides (2 1-25). ligands
that, in themselves, are not convulsive, but kindle the
systcm for other convulsive agents, are referred to as
partial inverse agonists [e.g. fg 7142, cgs 8216, ethyl pcarboline carboxylate (pcce), ro 15-45131 (26). in addition. there are partial agonists (e.g. bretazenil, ro 171812, zk 91 296, cgs 9896) (26) and antagonzsts (flumazenil, sarmazenil, zk93 426).
benzodiazcpine-antagonists such as flumazenil bind
with high afinity to the benzodiazepine receptor but
lack major intrinsic activity per se (27-29). however, by
competitive interaction at the bzr-binding domain,
they counteract the effects of  xxxd1459xxx  agonists and bzdinverse agonists.
the reversible receptor occupancy (r) by a  xxxd1459xxx 
agonist and antagonist can be described by equation 1
(30):
~

where, c=free concentration of the agonist at thc rcceptor site, c,=free concentration of the antagonist at the
receptor site and k, and k, arc the receptor affinities of
the agonist and antagonist, respectively.
flumazenil is 50% bound to proteins and 50% is
available in plasma in free concentration, whereas the
free fraction of midazolam or diazepam is less than 5'10.
both midazolam and flumazenil have high affinity
constants for the bz receptor (approximately 1nm compared with 9 nm for diazepam in isolated brain slices).
very small doses of flumazenil are therefore needed
to displace benzodiazepine agonists from the receptor
and to antagonize the benzodiazepine-induced effects.
the effect of flumazenil is to shift the dose-response
curve for each modality of agonist effect to the right.
relatively low doses of flumazenil will lighten midazolam-induced hypnosis and muscle relaxation, while progressively higher doses are required to ensure complete
reversal of all of the effects of the agonist.
it has been suggested that, whereas 1.5 mg of flumaz e d , given i.v., will occupy 55% of receptors, 15 mg

may be required to occupy most of the receptors (3i), in
a subject with no prior benzodiazepine treatment. this
is supported by findings in animals. martin et al. (32)
measured the in vzvo benzodiazepine occupancy from inhibition of 'h-flumazenil binding in rat brain. flumazenil was orally administered 30 min prior to sacrifice.
approximately 1.5 mg/kg flumazenil were necded to
reach a receptor occupancy of 55% and 15 mg/kg were
rrquired to occupy most of the receptors. taking into
account the bioavailability of flumazenil and its absorption kinetics, the resulting plasma concentration 30 niin
after intake is nearly identical with that found shortly
after i.v. injection of 1.5 mg, respectively 15 mg in
humans.
if used as an antagonist, only veiy small flumazenil
doses are needed to counteract the hypnotic effects of
benzodiazepine agonists whereas with flumazenil administered i.v., doses of 10 mg or higher may be needed
to antagonize the benzodiazepine-induced anxiolysis
(table 1).
thus, there are five groups ofligands for bz receptors
(33) and flumazenil antagonizes the other four groups.
flumazenil reverses all the effects of conventional bzds
without affecting their bioavailability or kinetics (34, 35).
at very high doses (5-100 mg/kg), flumazenil shows
some partial agonist activity in animal models and man
(36), and anticonvulsant properties (37).

analytical detection
one method to measure plasma concentrations is high
performance liquid chromatography (hplc) (38), which
has an accuracy of o.8-2%, a precision of 3.5-4'% and
a lower limit of sensitivity of 10 pg/1. a more recent
nnd more sensitive assay uses gas chromatography with
nitrogen-sensitive detection (39).
flumazenil can easily be labelled with a short-lived
positron emitting nuclide (e.g. " c ) and, due to its vcry
low nonspecific binding, can be used in pet (positron
emission tomography) scanning to visualize bzr in the
living human brain.
the pharmacokinetic behaviour of flumazcnil is
usually dcscribed by a two-compartment model, with a
first phase of rapid distribution and a second phase
dominated by metabolic elimination.
studies on human volunteers show that after i.v. irijection, flumazenil is distributed rapidly throughout thc
body and that the main distribution phase is complete
within 5 min. with i.v. doses from 1 to 100 mg, the
principal pharmacokinetic parameters are independent
of the dose (40, 41).
flumazenil has a high volume of distribution and
plasma clearance. the b1ood:plasma ratio is approximately unity (40, 41). at ph 7.4 and 37"c, only 50% is

bound to proteins, 75% of which is to albumin - this
is low compared with other bzds. some of the values
for basic pharmacokinetic data are shown in table 1
and a comparison of the data for midazolam and flumazenil in table 2.
in studies on healthy volunteers, it has been shown
that repeated clinical doses of flumazenil and midazolam
did not show cumulation or saturation kinetics (43).
the disposition of flumazenil was not affected by the
co-administration of benzodiazepine agonists such as midazolam (44) lormetazepam, flunitrazepam (45) or alcohol (46) and flumazenil had no influence on the disposition of these drugs.
these findings were recently confirmed by another
simultaneous study (43) of the pharmacokinetics of flumazenil and midazolam in 12 healthy chinese children
(5-9 years) undergoing circumcision. anaesthesia was
induced with midazolam 0.5 mg * kg-l i.v., following
premedication 2 h previously with an oral dose, also of
0.5 mg/kg. after surgery, a bolus dose of 10 pg * kg-'
of flumazenil was administered, followed by an infusion
of 5 pg kg-' . min-' until the child was orientated. in
comparison with the midazolam data, which was consistent with a three-compartment model, it was considered that the values for flumazenil were best interpreted by a non-compartmental analysis, because of the
bolus and infusion administration regimen used in this

study. the mean plasma concentration declined exponentially. the hplc assay used was not sufficiently sensitive to measure flumazenil in plasma 120 min after
dose administration. thc terminal half-life (35.3f- 13.8
min) may therefore be underestimated. for the same
reason the calculated plasma clearance (20.6%6.9
ml kg-i * min-') and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state (1.0%0.21 kg-') have to be interpreted with caution.
after oral administration, flumazenil is quickly and
completely (>%"/a) absorbed.
two hundred miligrams p.0. flumazenil induces peak
plasma concentrations of 143-439 pg/l within 20-90
min (40) these are approximately the same levels as
those measured after a single i.v. dose of 40 mg. due to
the high hepatic extraction ratio (70-80%), the mean
bioavailabilities (2sd) following oral doses of 20 and 40
mg were 15 ( 57) and 17 (? 8)%, respectively (40).
because of the high hepatic clearance, renal failure
has little effect on the dose requirement of flumazenil,
whereas titration of the dose as in usual clinical practice,
is recommended in hepatic failure.
studies using positron emission tomography (pet) in
healthy volunteers show a rapid distribution into, and
clearance from, the brain; flumazenil is not metabolized
in the brain and its water-soluble metabolites do not pass
the blood-brain barrier (47).

mtabolgrn
flumazenil is virtually completely metabolized and less
than 0.2% is recoverable unchanged in the urine.
following infusion of 40 mg i4c-flumazenil, the
radioactivity was completely eliminated from the body
within 48-72 h. most of the dose (60-70%) was excreted
in the urine within 2 h. total excretion of radioactivity
was 90-95% in the urine and 5-10% in the faeces.
the principal metabolic pathway is ester cleavage to
the free carboxycyclic acid and both the carboxycyclic
acid and the corresponding glucuronide have been isolated from urine. in addition, a desmethyl derivative has

also been described so that, to date, three metabolites of
flumazenil have been recovered - n-desrnethyl flumazenil, n-desmethyl flumazenil acid and flumazenil dcid
(4.1).
the metabolites are devoid of clinical or pharmacological activity as antagonists as well as agonists.

toxicology
single doses of more than 3,000 times the clinical dose/
kg are well tolerated in animals.
the mean i.v. and oral ldjo in mice are 168 and
4302 mg/kg, respectively, and in rats, 161 and 5989
mg/kg, respectively. there was very good systemic tolerance as shown by results from subchronic/chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs. in both species doses exceeding the clinical dose by a factor of 500 were still systemically very well tolerated when injected daily for 4 weeks
(48).
in rats and rabbits, flumazenil has no demonstrable
effects on fertility and reproduction, and it is not foetotoxic. from thc in uztro and in uzuo tests performed, flumazenil does not have mutagenic effects.
long-term toxicological studies (12 weeks and 12
months) were performed with peroral administration of
flumazenil. extremely high plasma concentrations
(cmax= 6000-28000 ng/nl) were reached. nevertheless
flumazenil was very well tolerated (48).
the therapeutic index relates the clinical dose with
the highest well-tolerated dose in animals. a high therapeutic index indicates a low toxicological risk. table 3
shows that the therapeutic index of flumazenil is extremely high (30).

doses of benzodiazepines, but does not antagonize the
acute lethal effects of benzodiazepine agonists or inverse
agonists. as expected, flumazenil precipitated withdrawal symptoms in animals made physically dependent
on a benzodiazepine agonist (52,53). flumazenil is not
an absolutely pure antagonist, since it also has a minimal
positive intrinsic efficacy. a weak anticonvulsant effect
has been observed in different animal models (54-56).

clinical pharmacology
flumazenil is active by all routes of administration, but
currently only an i.v. preparation is available for clinical
use.

in the clinical context, flumazenil is used to antagonize bzds with full agonist effects mediated by their specific receptors in the central nervous system. it reverses
all effects of benzodiazepines, which are, in increasing
order of receptor occupancy: anxiolysis, anticonvulsant
(20-25% occupancy), slight sedation, reduced attention,
amnesia, intense sedation (so0/, occupancy), musclc
relaxation and hypnosis and anaesthesia (60-90% occupancy). flumazenil progressively antagonizes these effects in reverse order (30).
in addition, flumazenil reverses the potentially
dangerous adverse physiological effects of the bzds, e.g.
respiratory and cardiovascular depression, and airway
obstruction.
in the clinical context, flumazenil is used after the
administration of benzodiazepines, if benzodiazepine-induced effects last for an inappropriately long duration
or are too intense. in clinical pharmacology studies flumazenil was also administered alone, before the agonist

versed the sedative effects of midazolam within 1 min
and the antagonistic effects gradually disappeared within
a period of 3.5 h.
dunton et al. (61) investigated the duration of effect
of varying doses of flumazenil, (ix. 0.2, 0.6, 1.0 and 3.0
mg), in volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
study. they found that in subjects sedated with a continuous infusion of midazolam (0.17 mg . kg-' * h-'), 3.0
mg of flumazenil produced a duration of reversal of sedation that was significantly longer than for the other
doses. two other studies (62, 63) have provided data on
the duration of effects of a single dose of flumazenil (2.5
mg and 10 mg, respectively) during midazolam infusions
to produce constant levels of sedation. in one study (63),
a constant blood level of 600 ng/ml midazolam was
maintained in 7 volunteers, and a single dose of 10 mg
of flumazenil completely reversed the effect of this high
sustained blood level for over 15 min.
dunton (61) also observed that the activity of flumazenil against lorazepam, which has a higher affinity for
 xxxd1459xxx  receptors than diazepam, was less than against diazepam, which was antagonized by lower doses for
longer periods of time.
much lower doses of flumazenil were necessary to
antagonize the sedative effects or the impairment of
memory and cognitive function induced by previous bolus injection of clinically appropriate benzodiazepine
doses to induce sleep or conscious sedation (e.g. diazepam 10 to 30 mg, midazolam 0.1-0.15 mg . kg-',
flunitrazepam 0.03 mg * kg-'). dependmg on the previously given dose of benzodiazepine and the time interval between the benzodiazepine and  xxxd2123xxx , flumazenil i.v. doses of 0.2-0.5 mg were sufficient
to rrverse the central depressant effects of therapeutic
doses of rnidazolam, diazepam or flunitrazepam (64-66).

amnesia
flumazenil antagonizes not only the benzodiazepine-induced sedation but also the amnesia. benzodiazepineinduced amnesia from events prior to the injection of
flumazenil will persist but the patient will remember
events occurring after the injection of flumazenil.
hitherto, the effect of flumazenil on some aspects of
benzodiazepine-induced amnesia remained a subject of
critical debate; for example, the effect of midazolam on
implicit memory was unknown. the results of a recent
study (67) indicate that:

midazolam, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg, impairs both explicit and implicit memory;
flumazenil reverses both the sedative and memory effects of midazolam, both explicit and implicit, and 1
mg is as effective as 3 mg; and

flumazenil per se in the doses used has no intrinsic
behavioural, sedative or amnesic effects (67).

concentrutiorreflct relationsh$
because of the sensitivity limits of the analytical techniques, detailed concentration-effect relationships for
flumazenil, unlike for midazolam, have only recently become available. concentrations as low as 10-20 pg/l
will reverse benzodiazepine-induced sedation (41).
data available at hoffmann-la roche show that in
healthy volunteers, after midazolam infusion at a rate of
0.06-0.20 mg . kg-' . h-', doses of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.0 mg
flumazenil will rapidly produce peak levels of awareness
in approximately 25% of subjects, and in over 50 and
75% at blood levels of 3, 5 and 15 ng/ml, respectively

(47).

eeg and auditory evoked potentzals
milligan et al. (68) found a good correlation between
blood concentrations of midazolam and the amplitude
of the p300 wave; values required 6 h to return to baseline after 0.3 mg/kg was infused over a short period.
in 1992, engelhardt et a]. (69) showed that eeg and
psychometric tests may return to within control values
after reversal of the effects of midazolam (up to 0.2 mg/
kg i.v.) using flumazenil 1 .0 mg i.v., with no evidence of
subsequent 'rebound sedation'. this was not true for the
auditory evoked p300 potential, where significant rebound occurred 60 and 120 min after the administration
of flumazenil. it was concluded that p300 mapping
would provide the best indicator of the residual effects
of midazolam. while it is too cumbersome for routine
clinical use, it could provide a method for research on
the interaction of psychopharmacological drugs, in order
to detect minor residual effects in sedation and reduced
vigilance (69).

onset of actzon
flumazenil's onset of action is rapid - within 1-2 min
(70, 31). lauven et al. (63) administered a single-bolus
dose of flumazenil (1 0 mg i.v.) to 7 young healthy adult
volunteers who had a mean steady-state plasma concentration of midazolam of approximately 600 ng/ml. all the
subjects opened their eyes without prompting by command in a median time of 36 s (range, 28-48 s), i.e. a little
over one arm-brain circulation time, and were fully orientated in time, place and person in a median time of 65 s
(range, 54-120 s). carter et al. (7 1) studied patients with a
mean age of 63 years (range, 36-80 years) undergoing
upper intestinal endoscopy, who received midazolam i.v.
in a mean (lsd) dose of 6.1 mg (22.2 mg; range, 6-10
mg). following removal of the endoscope, and a very short
period of observation, 0.5 mg flumazenil was administered i.v. over 20 s, followed by 0.1 mg/min up to a total

pharmaco1,ogy of flumazenil

dose of 1 .0 mg. following the initial bolus of flumazenil,
all patients rapidly became alert in a mean time of 1.1 inin
(range, 0.5-1 .r min).

admznzstratzon
flumazenil may be given by bolus or infusion vid the
venous route.
the recommended method of administration to rcvcrse the effects of bzds is by titration, starting with an
i.v. dose of 0.2 mg, followed by incremental i.v. doses of
0.1 mg, until the desired end-point is reached. the normal maximal required dose is 0.5 mg i.v., but some
anaesthesiologists prefer to use this dose as a single bolus
in otherwise healthy patients who have no relevant history of previous drug therapy (70). following massive
overdose of bzds or in critical care situations, total
doses between 1 and 2 mg may be required to produce
arousal. flumazenil's duration of action following a
single i.v. injection varied between 15 and 140 min (62,
63, 70) depending upon the relative doses of the agonist
and antagonist, their relative receptor-binding affinities,
half-lives and volumes of distribution, and the interval
between their administration.

the management of hepatic encephalopathy (73), alcohol intoxication (74) and in other forms of coma (75).
the drug has also been used orally in daily doses of
l(f90 mg in the management of epilepsy (37). the
results are claimed to be good in approximately 70"/0
of previously untreated patients and in about 50% of
patients who had epilepsy of long duration and had
already been treated with standard anticonvulsants
(37). however, all these claims still require suhstantiation.

contraindications
hypersensitivig
no hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for
flumazenil (see toxicology).
precautions
1. epileptic patients undergoing benzodiazepine therapy
there has been one report of the occurrence of a focal
seizure in a patient with status epilepticus treated with
diazepam (75), but the patient was also receiving
phenytoin and  xxxd2908xxx .
the use of  xxxd2123xxx  is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodlazepine
treatment for a prolonged period. although  xxxd2123xxx 
exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its ahrupt
suppression of the protective effect of a benzodiazepine agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic
patients.
2. raised intracranial pressure in patients treated with benzodiazepines
in animals treated with midazolam, flumazenil reversed the reduction in cerebral oxygen uptake and
intracranial pressure, and caused a significant overshoot in cerebral blood flow (76). in man, flumazenil
increased cerebral blood flow previously reduced by
the administration of midazolam (77). in patients receiving midazolam with severe head injury and very
high intracranial pressures, flumazenil was reported to
cause a large rise in intracranial pressure, from a
mean value of 20.3 mrnhg (23.5 sem) to 38.3
mmhg (?6.0) (n=8), and intracranial pressures in cxcess of 40 mmhg (5.33 kpa) occurred with major reductions in cerebral perfusion pressure (n=2) (78).
thus, until these findings are refiited, flumazenil
should be administered very slowly, if at all, and only
in small doses to patients with a high intracranial
pressure who are receiving bzds, preferably in the
presence of intracranial pressure monitoring.
3. combined drug overdose
in one patient who took an overdose of oxazepam
and chloral hydrate, the administration of 0.5 mg
flumazenil precipitated multifocal ventricular beats
with episodes of ventricular tachycardia (79). 111 a scc-

10

j. g. whitwam & r. amrein

ond patient, a convulsion was reported in response to
the administration of flumazenil in a case of mixed
overdose that included a tricyclic antidepressant (80).
it is also possible that sedation or anaesthesia with
a  xxxd1459xxx  could mask a toxic reaction to an overdose of
a local anaesthetic, which would be precipitated by
the administration of flumazenil.
4. anxiogenic reactions
anxiety has been reported on awakening following
flumazenil. however, most of these reactions are due
to the rapid reversal of heavily sedated, amnesic patients in an unfamiliar clinical environment (72). this
is likely to occur, for example, if a previously healthy
patient is rendered unconscious in a road accident
and is subsequently suddenly aroused in an intensive
care unit.
there is, however, a very small group of patients
who are subject to panic attacks; this is a specific psychiatric disorder and, arguably, such attacks could be
precipitated by flumazenil (81, 82).
special patient groups
neonates
no adverse effects have been observed in rats following
daily oral administration of up to 125 mg/kg flumazenil
from the 16th day of pregnancy to the 22nd day postpartum. comparable human data do not yet exist and
as yet there is no product licence for use of the drug in
neonates.

breast milk
like other bzds, flumazenil is expected to be excreted
in breast milk. however, following therapeutic doses to
a lactating woman, such excretion would be expected to
be transient, in low concentration and of no consequence. at the time of writing, flumazenil has not been
measured in breast milk.

should be administered slowly, in incremental doses of
0.1 mg, until the desired effect is achieved.

concuvent disease
as outlined above, renal impairment does not affect the
use of flumazenil, while in patients with hepatic failure,
the duration of action of the drug will be prolonged.
reversal of  xxxd1459xxx  action with flumazenil is not associated
with hypertension and so, unlike naloxone, it is not
contraindicated in patients with hypertension or cardiovascular disease.
pathology tests
there have been no reports of interference by flumazenil with the results of such tests.

areas of critical debate
resedation
this concept was based on the short half-life of flumazenil relative to  xxxd1459xxx  agonists, including midazolam, with
the additional potential problem of enterohepatic circulation for those bzds with longer half-lives than midazolam.
the subject was given prominence in one early report
from new zealand (83). in the past, the desirability of
the very existence of flumazenil was challenged (84).
however, serious dangerous resedation has always been
a non-sequitur, even in the elderly, when midazolam and
flumazenil are used for sedation or anaesthesia in pal c m -

care (e.g. 82 overdose or asaiii-v)

children
little information relating to the use of flumazenil in
children is available and as yet there are no specific
guidelines. the drug should be carefully titrated to a
desired end-point, using weight-related doses.
pregnant women
controlled studies of the potential use of flumazenil in
pregnancy have not been performed. where a  xxxd1459xxx  is
being used to control convulsions, e.g. eclampsia, arguably, flumazenil is contraindicated.

small doses of agonist (e.g. midazolam) and flumazenil

chronic benzodiazepine user5
concern has been expressed that flumazenil could precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome (86) in patients
recciving prolonged  xxxd1459xxx  medication, comparable with
that induced by naloxone in chronic opioid users. withdrawal symptoms, never prolonged or severe, have followed flumazenil in several species of  xxxd1459xxx -treatcd animals (87). a recent paper suggests, however, that far
from being a problem, flumazenil may be useful in the
treatment of  xxxd1459xxx  tolerance (3 1). this investigation used
pet scanning to study receptor occupancy in patients
with temporal lobe epilepsy who had become tolerant to
clonazepam. a single dose of flumazenil (1.5 mg i.v.)
restored the effectiveness of clonazepam, such that the
patients wcrc scizurc frec for 6-2 1 days. the group attributed the absence of withdrawal seizures to three possible factors:
the anticonvulsive effects of flumazenil;
the fact that 1.5 mg flumazenil only occupies 45-55"%
of the bz receptors and 2-5 mg clonazepam only
30%; and
the configurational resetting of the bz receptors,
which is a putative mechanism of flumazenil.

rectoratzon o j vmtzlatoy response5 to kypoxaemia and h@errai bin
it has been suggested that full recovery of chemoreflcxes
following reversal of  xxxd1459xxx  sedation with either midazolam (7 1) or diazepam (88) is delayed even when scdation
is fully reversed in clinical terms. in a study of only 5
patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy by
mora et al. (88), diazepam doses as high as 140 mg were
administered, and it is posaible that the doses of flumazenil were too small to antagonize fully the very high
doses of diazepdm. the following considerations should
make one reappraise such evidence.
1. early animal work (89) clearly showed that flumazenil
rapidly rcstorcd phrenic nerve activity prrviously
abolished by midazolam in isocarbic, isooxaemic, isotensive, anaesthetizcd dogs, and that the bursts of activity remained locked to the ventilator cycle.
2. in normal volunteers, power et al. (90) found <i spontaneous variation in the sd of c o presponses in excess of 50% of the mean values for the slope and 25%
for the intercept, both over time (6 h) and on diffcrcnt
days.
3. responses to hypoxaemia are non-linear and also
show adaption (91).

q. neither midazolam nor diazepam in sedativr doses
has a major effect on c o p responsiveness (92, 93)
and, in general, bzds cause minimal respiratory depression (94).
5. recent evidence suggests that the doses of flumazenil
required to exert full receptor occupancy are higher
than was previously thought, e.g. as high as 15 mg in
man (31). when very large doses of bzds are administered, doses of only 1 mg flumazenil may be inadequate to reverse their effects.
6. a recent study (95) tested the ventilatory response to
c o , in 12 young healthy male volunteers who received sufficient midazolam to render them unresponsive to verbal command [o. 1 3 5 0.0 1 mg/ kg i.v.
(meanksd)], followed by either 1.0 mg flumazenil
or placebo. flumazenil rapidly reversed sedation
and restored the values for vt and ve, with an
end-tidal c o p tension, i.e. p,\c02, stabilized at 46
mmhg. there was, however, no difference between
the effects of flumazenil or placebo on the slope of
the c 0 2 response curve, which was reduced in both
groups from under 2 l/min/mmcop to less than
1.5 l/min/mmc02 after flumazenil, with spontaneous recovery to this value in 3 min. after recovery, however, the slope remained depressed from
the initial control value of 2 i/min/mmc02 by
around 16-21% after flumazenil for up to 120 min,
with no difference between the flumazenil and placebo groups.
the authors conclude that whereas flumazenil
immediately restored resting ventilation it had no
effect on the slope of the c o p response curve. unfortunately, the mean values for these curves never
returned to control in either the flumazenil or placebo groups, but nonetheless remained within an
acceptable physiological, and hence clinical, range
(95).
another interpretation of the data would be that
the effect of midazolam, as measured by the co, response curve, rapidly declines, so that little difference
would be expected between the flumazenil and placebo groups. this would be in keeping with previously
expressed views on the relatively small effect of bzds
alone on c 0 2 responsiveness (92, 93). the failure of
ve to return to the mean control values of 2 i/min in
c 0 2 could be explained by an initial anxiety factor
when control measurements were made before the administration of midazolam.
7. the most important recent study in this field is by
blouin et al. (96). this group showed that under isocarbic conditions (petcol=48 mmhg) in 12 healthy
male volunteers, a mean dose of 0.12 (-+0.1)mg/kg
midazolam decreased the ventilatory response to hypoxia; however, after flumazenil, which reversed the

12

j. g. whitwam & r. amrein

effects of midazolam, both the mean ve90 and the
slope of the response exceeded the pre-midazolam
values by approximately 20 and 8% (p<o.o5), respectively.
8. those involved with the management of patients suffering from  xxxd1459xxx  overdose or with midazolam sedation in intensive care have not observed that reversal
of its 'anaesethetic' or sedative effects by flumazenil,
whether by bolus or infusion, selectively fails to restore
adequate ventilation.
whether or not the paper by blouin (96) has finally
laid the 'ghost' to rest, it is true to say that the most
important property of flumazenil is its ability to restore consciousness. this will allow reversal of druginduced respiratory obstruction, particularly when
opioids and bzds, with their synergistic effects, have
been combined, leading to unplanned loss of consciousness, respiratory obstruction and central respiratory depression (97). both gross et al. (95) and blouin et al. (96) have shown that flumazenil restores
resting ventilation, which is the important issue, since
the slope of the copresponse curve remained within
a physiological, and hence an acceptable clinical,
range throughout their studies.

conclusions
flumazenil is the first specific bz receptor antagonist a consequence of the discovery of the bz receptor. quite
apart from its use in  xxxd1459xxx  drug overdose and critically
ill patients, its arrival is timely in relation to the development of minimally invasive therapy and day-case
surgery.
the introduction of new technology and imaging
techniques transfers a whole range of surgical procedures, formerly carried out as inpatients under general
anaesthesia, to the day-case setting using sedoanalgesia.
as a result, an increasing number of non-anaesthetically
trained practitioners, e.g. interventional radiologists,
gastroenterologists, cardiologists and rlieumatologists are
having to practise sedation, so that flumazenil has important implications for safety.
the ability to reverse the effects of  xxxd1459xxx  sedation has
also created the possibility of a new modus operandi, which
is less dependent on recovery facilities and can permit a
more rapid turnover of patients with important implications for health economics.
the existence of such a neutral compound (i.e. at clinical doses, it has virtually no pharmacological effects per
se in normal subjects), which is very similar in structure
to other bzds is important. it has implications for future
ill depend on transcription genetics,
research, which w
the chemistry of the binding of drugs to 'receptors' and

the effects on ion conductance and, ultimately, on protein chemistry.
