abstract
cancer, one of the leading causes of death worldwide is estimated to increase to approximately 13.1 million
by 2030. this has amplified the research in oncology towards the exploration of novel targets. recently
there has been lots of interest regarding the hedgehog (hh) pathway, which plays a significant role in the
development of organs and tissues during embryonic and postnatal periods. in a normal person, the hh
signaling pathway is under inhibition and gets activated upon the binding of hh ligand to a transmembrane
receptor called patched ( xxxg1867xxx ) thus allowing the transmembrane protein, smoothened (smo) to transfer
signals through various proteins. one of the newer drugs namely  xxxd3519xxx  involves the inhibition of hh
pathway and has shown promising results in the treatment of advanced basal‑cell carcinoma as well as
medulloblastoma. it has been granted approval by us food and drug administration’s (us fda) priority
review program on january 30, 2012 for the treatment of advanced basal‑cell carcinoma. the drug is also
being evaluated in malignancies like medulloblastoma, pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma, chondrosarcoma
and prostate cancer. moreover various hh inhibitors namely  xxxd2026xxx ,  xxxd3174xxx , bms 833923, leq 506,
pf‑ 04449913 and tak‑441 are also undergoing phase i and ii trials for different neoplasms. hence this
review will describe briefly the hh pathway and the novel drug  xxxd3519xxx .
key words: advanced basal‑cell carcinoma, hedgehog pathway, medulloblastoma

introduction
cancer, one of the leading causes of death in both developed
and developing countries, account for nearly 13% of all deaths.
in 2008, the global cancer‑related mortality was found to be 7.6
million and was estimated to increase to approximately 13.1
million in 2030.[1] hence there is a need for newer treatment
strategies with novel drugs acting at different pathways for
treatment of malignancies and there has been a tremendous

pressure on the healthcare researchers and pharmaceutical
industries to explore newer approaches for the treatment
of cancer. the newer targets being investigated in cancer
therapy include mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor)
signaling,  xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) pathway,
transforming growth factor–beta (tgf‑beta) signaling, nuclear
factor kappab ( xxxg1559xxx ), ras etc.[2] in the last few years, there
has been a growing attention towards a distinct newer target
namely hedgehog (hh) pathway. the aberrant signaling in hh
pathway has been found to be associated with the occurrence
of basal‑cell carcinoma (bcc), medulloblastoma, multiple
myeloma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma and
lymphoma.[3‑7] currently a newer drug,  xxxd3519xxx  acting
through inhibition of the hh pathway has been approved by the
us food and drug administration’s (us fda) priority review
program on january 30, 2012, for the treatment of advanced
form of basal‑cell carcinoma.[8,9] this has further accelerated
the focus towards the novel targets for cancer therapy and this

sandhiya, et al.: hedgehog inhibitor

review will discuss briefly on the newer hh pathway inhibitor
 xxxd3519xxx .
the hedgehog pathway was first recognized in mutant fruit
flies by christiane nusslein and eric wieschaus in 1980. it
was named after the larvae of mutant fruit fly, which resembled
hedgehogs and the discovery was awarded nobel prize for
physiology or medicine in 1995.[10] the hh pathway plays
a significant role in the development of organs and tissues
during embryonic and postnatal periods. it is involved in
determining the site of growth of fingers in the limb buds and
the formation of motor neurons in the developing spinal cord.[11]
under physiological conditions, the hh signaling pathway is
under inhibition and gets activated upon the binding of hh
ligand to a  xxxg1608xxx  called patched ( xxxg1867xxx )
as shown in figure 1. the activation of hh pathway allows

hedgehog (hh) pathway.  xxxg1867xxx  -  xxxg1867xxx ,  xxxg1608xxx ;
smo - smoothened, transmembrane protein; hh - hedgehog. (a) shows
that during normal conditions,  xxxg1867xxx  keeps smo under repression.
(b) shows that hh ligand binds to  xxxg1867xxx  receptor and inhibits its inhibitory
effect on smo, thus promoting the signal transduction via hh pathway

the transmembrane protein, smoothened (smo) to transfer
signals through various proteins.[4] the abnormal hh signaling
resulting in new tumors or acceleration of existing tumors could
be due to mutation in the hh pathway, paracrine or autocrine
activation by hh ligands, involvement of stroma or activation
of cancer stem cells (cscs).[6,12] it has been hypothesized that
the activation of cancer stem cells (cscs) through abnormal
hh signaling could be a reason for uncontrolled self‑renewal
of tumor cells and the occurrence of metastasis. among
the various cancers, studies have shown the significance of
mutations in  xxxg1867xxx  leading to the pathogenesis of sporadic
bccs and medulloblastoma.[13,14]
the discovery of cyclopamine, a natural product known to
bind smo protein, resulting in the inhibition of hh signaling,
opened a new pathway in the designing and discovery of hh
pathway inhibitors.[15,16] presently  xxxd3519xxx , a novel small
molecule hh inhibitor, which acts by inhibiting smo protein
involved in hh signal transduction has shown promising
anti‑tumor responses in advanced bcc and has been approved
by the us fda for the same.[7,17]
efficacy
some of the clinical trials done in advanced cancer patients
with  xxxd3519xxx  are shown in table 1.[18‑21] in an open label,
multicenter, two‑stage phase i trial,  xxxd3519xxx  was found
to have acceptable safety profile and anti‑tumor activity
in 68 patients with advanced bcc and medulloblastoma.
similarly, another multicenter clinical trial among 96 patients
with locally advanced or metastatic bcc showed 30% partial
response in patients with metastatic disease and 43% complete
or partial response in patients with locally advanced disease,
thus demonstrating the safety and efficacy of  xxxd3519xxx . in a
phase 2 study involving 41 patients with basal‑cell carcinoma,
 xxxd3519xxx  group was found to have only four new tumors
over a period of one year compared to 24 new tumors in the
placebo group. the same study also demonstrated shrinkage

sandhiya, et al.: hedgehog inhibitor

of existing skin lesions in patients receiving  xxxd3519xxx , while
the placebo group had modest growth. a phase ii international,
single‑arm, two‑cohort study (erivance bcc) trial with
 xxxd3519xxx  on subjects with inoperable metastatic or locally
advanced basal‑cell carcinoma achieved the primary endpoint
of overall response rate as assessed by an independent review.
this interim analysis revealed that at a dose of 150 mg given
orally once daily till disease progression or toxicity resulted in
an overall response rate of 43% and 30% in locally advanced
and metastatic cohorts, respectively. the analysis also showed
prolonged stable disease for more than 24 weeks in 75% of the
locally advanced cohort and 76% of the metastatic cohort. the
study subjects in advanced and metastatic cohorts were found
to have 9.5 months and 7.6 months of median progression free
survival, respectively.[20] based on the trials,  xxxd3519xxx  was
approved on january 30, 2012, by us fda’s priority review
program and is the first fda‑approved drug to be used in
advanced form of basal‑cell carcinoma.[22]
pharmacokinetics
 xxxd3519xxx  is absorbed orally and its absorption is not interfered
by food. it has high affinity to human  xxxg124xxx  (hsa)
and alpha‑1‑acid glycoprotein (aag). the drug has solubility
limited absorption with slow elimination and is excreted as an
unchanged product.  xxxd3519xxx  gets metabolized to several
minor metabolites by multiple cytochrome p450 (cyp)
enzymes and is a substrate for cyp2c9, cyp3a4 and
p‑glycoprotein (p‑gp). the drug has not shown any alteration
with cyp inhibitors but following co‑administration with p‑gp
inhibitors like clarithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin
etc., there is a higher chance of adverse drug reactions with
 xxxd3519xxx . the drug may have reduced bioavailability with
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitors, h2‑receptor blockers and antacids,
owing to less solubility at a higher ph.[23]
indications
 xxxd3519xxx  ( xxxd3519xxx ™), a hh pathway inhibitor, has
been approved by us fda for the treatment of adults with
metastatic basal‑cell carcinoma or with locally advanced
basal‑cell carcinoma that has recurred following surgery or in
those patients who are not candidates for surgery or radiation.
the recommended dose of  xxxd3519xxx  is 150 mg given once
daily through oral route. the drug has to be prescribed in the
above‑mentioned disease states until the disease progresses or
unacceptable toxicity occurs.
 xxxd3519xxx  has not been approved by other regulatory
agencies so far. it is being evaluated in phase ii trials for
operable basal‑cell carcinoma. disappointing results seen with
 xxxd3519xxx  in ovarian and colorectal cancers have not limited
its manufacturer genentech to expand its clinical development
in other areas. the drug is being tested in malignancies such
as medulloblastoma, pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma,
chondrosarcoma and prostate cancer. currently, various hh
6

inhibitors namely  xxxd2026xxx ,  xxxd3174xxx , bms 833923, leq
506, pf‑04449913 and tak‑441 are being evaluated in phase
i and ii trials for different neoplasms as shown in table 2.[24‑29]
however,  xxxd3174xxx , another hh inhibitor failed to improve
overall response rate in patients with pancreatic carcinoma.
the fact that hh inhibitors have shown varied response in
different malignancies makes it clear that the hh pathway does
not have the same role in all cancers.[30]
adverse effects
the most common adverse events reported from clinical trials
with  xxxd3519xxx  include muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia,
weight loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and decreased appetite.
all these adverse events were seen in 20 to 40% of patients.
ctcae (common terminology criteria for adverse events)
grade 4 events experienced by the trial patients included
hyponatremia, pyelonephritis and presyncope. hyponatremia
and fatigue were reversible on temporary discontinuation of the
drug.[16] as with all chemotherapeutic agents, acquired mutations
in smo receptor can result in resistance to  xxxd3519xxx .[31]
special situations
 xxxd3519xxx  is considered as a category d drug and carries
a boxed warning stating that the drug can cause fetal death
or severe birth defects during pregnancy. hence pregnancy
needs to be ruled out at least 7 days before starting treatment,
and both male and female patients need to be informed
regarding the risk. advice needs to be given about the need
for contraception in female patients and the potential risk for
 xxxd3519xxx  exposure through semen in male patients.
in lactating mothers, the decision to continue the drug during
lactation should be based on the disease status of lactating mother
and the risk benefit ratio. it should not be prescribed in children as
the safety and effectiveness of the drug has not been established
in this age group. in addition, patients treated with  xxxd3519xxx 
should be advised not to donate blood or blood products while
receiving the drug and for at least 7 months after the last dose.[32]

conclusion
targeting the hh pathway appears to be a promising strategy

sandhiya, et al.: hedgehog inhibitor

in cancer chemotherapy with the approval of  xxxd3519xxx .
hh pathway inhibitors could become a boon in the future for
the treatment of various chemoresistant tumors. although
 xxxd3519xxx  has shown encouraging results in early clinical
studies that has led to its accelerated approval for advanced bcc,
the long‑term safety and efficacy in larger populations need to
be proven using well‑designed robust phase 3 clinical trials, if
it has to remain a formidable weapon against aggressive tumors
in the long run. besides  xxxd3519xxx , other new molecules that
inhibit hh pathway at several distinct sites are being tested in
number of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, most
of which are in early phases of clinical development. since hh
signaling is also essential for the viability of various normal
stem cells like bone marrow and skin, the concerns of major
toxicity are not unfounded and warrant intensive monitoring.[33]
hence regulatory authorities need to carefully review trials with
such group of drugs before taking any decision regarding the
approval of hh pathway inhibitors. nevertheless, hh pathway
inhibitors may offer a ray of hope to those battling with advanced
malignancies with a dismal prognosis.
