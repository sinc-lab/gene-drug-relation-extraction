summary
methylation of dna at 5-position of cytosine,
catalyzed by dna methyltransferases, is the predominant epigenetic modification in mammals.
aberrations in methylation play a causal role in a
variety of diseases, including cancer. recent studies have established that like mutation, methylation-mediated gene silencing often leads to tumorigenesis. paradoxically, genome-wide dna hypomethylation may also play a causal role in

carcinogenesis by inducing chromosomal instability and spurious gene expression. since methylation does not alter dna base sequence, much attention has been focused recently on developing
small molecule inhibitors of dna methyltransferases that can potentially be used as anticancer
agents.  xxxd253xxx ® ( xxxd253xxx ), marketed by
 xxxd3342xxx  (boulder, co, usa), was the first dna
methyltransferase inhibitor approved by the u. s.
food and drug administration (fda) for chemotherapy against myelodysplastic syndrome (mds),
a heterogeneous bone marrow disorder. recently
mgi pharma inc. (bloomington, mn, usa) got
fda approval to market dacogentm (5-aza-2’- xxxd1836xxx , or  xxxd1823xxx ) for treating mds patients. these drugs were used earlier against certain anemias to induce expression of fetal globin

genes. interest in clinical trials of these drugs as
anticancer agents has been renewed only recently
because of reversal of methylation-mediated silencing of critical genes in cancer. clinical trials
have shown that both drugs have therapeutic potential against leukemia such as mds, acute
myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia
and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. in contrast,
their effectiveness with solid tumors appears to be
less promising, which challenges researchers to
develop inhibitors with more efficacy and less toxicity. the major hindrance of their usage as anticancer agents is their instability in vivo as well as
the toxicity secondary to their excessive incorporation into dna, which causes cell cycle arrest. gene
expression profiling in cancer cells revealed that
antineoplastic property of these drugs is mediated
through both methylation-dependent and -independent pathways. recently, we have shown that
treatment of cancer cells with these cytidine analogues also induces proteasomal degradation of
 xxxg644xxx , the ubiquitously expressed enzyme upregulated in almost all cancer
cells. development of related stable drugs that can
facilitate gene activation in cancer cells by enhancing degradation of dna methyltransferases
without being incorporated into dna would be ideal for chemotherapy. in this monograph we review
historical perspective and recent advances on the
molecular mechanisms of action and clinical applications of these dna hypomethylating agents. ©

introduction
dna methylation and histone modifications are
two key players in epigenetic regulation of gene
expression in mammalian cells. extensive analysis
of different types of human cancer has revealed
that epigenetic alteration of the genome plays a
causal role in tumorigenesis. unlike genetic
changes, epigenetic changes can be reversed by
pharmacological intervention, a lot of interest,
therefore, has been focused on understanding the
structure and functions of key cellular enzymes
that mediate these epigenetic processes and on
developing small molecule inhibitors that target
these proteins.  xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx  are
two well-known inhibitors of dna methyltransferases that are effective against bone marrow
disorders such as myelodisplastic syndrome
(mds).

 xxxd1823xxx 
myelodysplastic syndrome
mds is a group of bone marrow disorders
characterized by the inability of hematopoietic
stem cells to differentiate into mature blood cells
(1–3). mds patients have low blood counts due to
the production of the “dysplastic” or morphologically abnormal cells. mds patients can suffer from
anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, depending upon the type of blood-forming cells in the marrow being most affected. the expansion of neoplastic clonal stem cells results in ineffective
hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenia that often
leads to acute myelogenous leukemia (aml). low
blood counts amid hypercellular bone marrow in
mds is likely due to excessive loss of progenitor
cells by apoptosis caused by activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf-alpha).
currently ~30,000 new cases of mds are diagnosed annually in the united states (4–8).
approval from the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) of  xxxd253xxx ® ( xxxd253xxx ;  xxxd3342xxx , boulder, co, usa) and dacogentm (5-aza2’- xxxd1836xxx , or  xxxd1823xxx ; mgi pharma inc.,
bloomington, mn, usa) brings hope for mds patients who are too fragile to be treated with
chemotherapy because of advanced age or poor
health due to other associated diseases. patients
with this serious condition are often anemic, experience fatigue and weakness and, in certain cases,
experience bone marrow failure due to an increase
in leukemic blast cells.
since mds is a heterogeneous disease, its diagnosis is difficult. pathologists use some international classification systems for diagnosis of mds
(7, 9). the french-american-british (fab) system
classified mds into five groups based on the morphology and number of different cell types in bone
marrow and peripheral blood (table i). it is the oldest system and still is widely used by oncologists
(9). the world health organization classified mds
into different subgroups, some of which are in
common with the fab system and some of which
are distinct subtypes (table i).
the prognosis of mds patients is critical for
predicting their survival and selecting the proper
therapeutic regimen. according to international
prognostic scoring system (ipss), three criteria
can predict prognosis of mds quite well (7, 9, 10)
(table ii). these are based on the number of cytopenias (or how many different types of blood
cells are affected), population of blast cells in the
bone marrow and the abnormal karyotype in bone

marrow, if any. analysis of these parameters can
predict the survival of patients and their possible
transition toward aml (table ii). mds is a rare
bone marrow disorder that occurs in 4 out of
100,000 people. the disease is prevalent among
elderly males, although mds with chromosome-5q

loss is common in elderly females (11). its incidence among people over 70 years of age is >30
per 100,000. mds may also evolve from related
disorders such as aplastic anemia (after treatment
with immunosuppressant) or paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria. mds is rare among children and

398
symptoms are different than the adult form.
children with other blood disorders such as
fanconi anemia and bloom’s syndrome sometimes develop mds.
in recent years, considerable progress has
been made in understanding the biology of mds.
most adult-onset mds is not due to an inherited
genetic disorder. the etiology of mds is multifarious and sometimes takes decades before manifestation of the symptoms. the cause of mds remains largely unknown at the present time, but
possibilities include genetic lesions and infection
or malfunction of the immune system. mds and
aml can result following cytotoxic drug therapy
such as dna alkylating agents for other types of
cancer. people exposed inadvertently to ionizing
radiation or subjected to radiation therapy for other types of malignancies may develop mds.
exposure to high concentrations of benzene causes bone marrow toxicity that progressively leads to
mds and/or aml.
at present, bone marrow transplant appears to
be the only option for cure, but this high-risk procedure cannot be applied to the majority of patients over 60 years, many of whom have other ailments. standard supportive care for mds includes
blood transfusion and administration of growth factors to stimulate hematopoiesis, and antibiotics to
prevent infection. however, these treatments are
also ineffective in patients with advanced age.
therefore, much attention has now been focused
on pharmacologic intervention with agents including inhibitors of dna methyltransferases such as
 xxxd253xxx  or its congener  xxxd1823xxx .
 xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx 
the fda granted approval to market
 xxxd1823xxx  for treatment of patients with all subtypes of mds on may 3, 2006.  xxxd1823xxx  injection
is currently available for treatment of previously
treated or untreated, de novo or secondary mds
patients with mds subtypes, such as refractory
anemia or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, excess blasts or excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
(cmmol) (table i) in both low- and high-risk ipss
groups (table ii).  xxxd253xxx  was approved in
2004 by the fda.  xxxd1823xxx  restores normal
growth and differentiation of bone marrow cells. it
has been shown to exhibit therapeutic potential in
several blood disorders and to a lesser extent
against solid tumors. it is already available to on-

 xxxd1823xxx 
cologists to treat mds patients. phase ii trials of
 xxxd1823xxx  for treating mds were reported to show
favorable response in platelet counts of patients. a
phase iii trial of  xxxd1823xxx  further studied its effectiveness and safety. the study compared patients
receiving  xxxd1823xxx  plus supportive care to patients receiving supportive care only. overall response (partial or complete) to  xxxd1823xxx  was reported to be 22%. the major side effects are nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, pneumonia,
arthralgia, headache and insomnia. severe adverse events observed were low leukocytes and
low neutrophils (types of white blood cells).
recent clinical studies showed that compared
to supportive care, treatment with the demethylating drugs,  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx , results in
significantly higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation,
and improved survival. low doses of  xxxd253xxx 
and  xxxd1823xxx  are the treatment option for elderly
patients with high-risk mds. at low doses
 xxxd1823xxx  is more effective because it promotes
differentiation with minimal toxicity. it is encouraging to note that these drugs are very effective in
mds patients with poor prognosis. the combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors such as
 xxxd3485xxx  and  xxxd3529xxx 
appears to increase the efficacy of these dna
methyltransferase ( xxxg644xxx ) inhibitors (12).
biological role of dna methylation
in mammals
methylation at 5-position of cytosine is the predominant epigenetic modification in the mammalian genome (13–17) (fig. 1). in mammals
methylcytosines almost exclusively occur in complimentary cpg base pairs with only a small
amount of cpa or cpt methylation. most of methylated cpgs span primarily in cpg-poor regions of
the genome. in contrast, most of the gene promoters are dense in cpgs, termed cpg islands
(cgis), and are usually methylation free in normal
cells. cgis are defined as the region of the dna
where the cpg to gpc ratio is 0.6 within a 200 bp
segment. in cancer cells the methylation landscape is totally altered; cpgs in repeat elements
are hypomethylated, but cgis on some gene promoters are frequently de novo methylated. only recently, dna methylation profiles of four human
chromosomes in 12 different tissues from normal
individuals were analyzed by high throughput
bisulfite genomic sequencing, which revealed

k. ghoshal and s. bai

399
dous progress, the precise molecular function of
dna methylation has not been completely elucidated.

sam = s-adenosyl methionine.

some unique findings (18). although most of cgis
were unmethylated in normal tissues, the genes
that were hypermethylated in diseased state had a
cpg density less than 10%. the fact that methylation at a few cpg in 5' utrs of non-cgi promoters repressed gene expression called into question the dogma, held until recently, that dna methylation affects expression of only the cgi promoters. thus, in the near future many more genes
will be identified whose expression is regulated by
methylation at cpgs in non-cgis.
dna methylation is essential for mammalian
development. it is required for silencing of proviral
promoters and retrotransposons in the genome
(19, 20), maintaining genomic stability, inactivation
of x chromosomes in females and regulation of
maternal- or paternal-specific expression of imprinted genes (21–24). although tissue-specific
dna methylation has been reported, its role in tissue-specific gene expression was not well established until recently (25–28). sequencing of the
majority of the cpg of four human chromosomes
showed that ~25% of the cpgs were tissue-specifically methylated and were preferentially located
several kbs away from the nearest coding regions
that predominantly harbor enhancers, insulators,
etc. furthermore, like single-nucleotide polymorphisms, variations in methylation profiles exist
among different individuals (18). despite tremen-

three functional dnmts and their associated
cofactors maintain methylation profile
of the mammalian genome
mammalian cells express three functional
dnmts that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups
to the 5-position of cytosines (29–31) (fig. 2). de
novo dnmts ( xxxg645xxx /3b) establish dna methylation patterns in unmethylated dna, whereas maintenance methyltransferase (dnmt1), which prefers
hemimethylated cpgs (methylated in one strand)
as substrates, propagates the established methylation pattern to daughter cells by methylation of
the newly replicated strand (fig. 1). the mammalian enzymes harbor six motifs in their catalytic
domains that are homologous to those of bacterial
cytosine methyltransferases (29, 32).
unlike the bacterial cytosine methyltransferase, the mammalian dnmts harbor a large nterminal region involved in dna binding and interactions with chromatin-modifying proteins (fig. 2).
by virtue of their large n-termini, mammalian
dnmts are involved in spatial and temporal regulation of promoter methylation of specific genes in
the chromatin context.
dnmt1
dnmt1 is the first founding member of the dna
methyltransferase family that is highly conserved
among mammals (33, 34). it is the largest among
all dnmts, consisting of more than 1,600 amino
acids (fig. 2). its catalytic domain in the carboxyl
terminus is homologous to bacterial cytosine
methyltransferases. its relatively large n-terminal
region harbors nuclear localization signal (nls) as
well as motifs for protein–protein interactions (30).
two bromo-adjacent homology (bah) domains located in tandem were originally identified in proteins associated with chromatin (35, 36). dnmt1
devoid of the bah domains is retained in the cytoplasm, indicating that both bah domains and
n-terminal nls of dnmt1 are required for its nuclear import (37). dnmt1 is constitutively expressed in all tissues and cells examined. it is essential for differentiation of embryonic stem cells
and is required for mammalian development (29,
38). dnmt1 null embryonic stem cells are unable to
differentiate due to spurious activation of repetitive
elements such as alu1, intracisternal a particle
and other retrotransposons (29, 30, 39, 40). dnmt1

null embryonic stem cells also show genome-wide
hypomethylation causing genomic instability, loss
of genomic imprinting and activation of both x
chromosomes in females. expression of dnmt1 is
cell-cycle dependent, with the highest expression
observed in s phase. it is regulated both at the
transcriptional and post-translational levels (37,
41, 42). degradation of dnmt1 within the nucleus
occurs by proteasomal pathway that is facilitated
further by treatment with the inhibitor of dna
methyltransferase 5-aza-2’- xxxd1836xxx . the
ken box of dnmt1 appears to be the degradation
signal, which is recognized by the apc/ccdh1 e3
ligase complex (37).
dnmt1 interacts directly with many regulatory
proteins and in many cases interacting domains
are identified (fig. 2). proliferative cell nuclear antigen (pcna), a member of the dna-replication
complex, recruits dnmt1 to replication foci to
methylate the newly replicated strand. coupled
dna replication and dna methylation maintain the
heritable dna methylation pattern in cells (43).

biochemical fractionation reveals association of
dnmts with other repressors and co-repressor
complexes. dnmt1 associates with both retinoblastoma (rb) and  xxxg668xxx  and represses specifically  xxxg668xxx -target genes in hela cells (44).
a sex-specific isoform of dnmt1, dnmt1o,
which lacks the n-terminal 118aa due to alternative promoter usage, is specifically expressed during oogenesis. dnmt1o is transported from the cytoplasm to nuclei at eight-cell stage during preimplantation, where it maintains dna methylation
patterns on silent alleles of imprinted genes.
during spermatogenesis, alternative splicing produces a shorter transcript that appears to cause
downregulation of dnmt1 post-transcriptionally
(45).
dnmt2
dnmt2 is homologous to both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic dna methyltransferases (fig. 2).
dnmt2 exhibits very weak dna methyltransferase
activity both in vitro and in vivo, although it harbors

k. ghoshal and s. bai

401

all the conserved motifs of the catalytic domain
(46, 47). it does not appear to play any crucial role
in the maintenance of dna methylation in mammals (48). dnmt2 maintains very low level methylation at cp(a/t) motifs only in drosophila that does
not express other functional dnmts (17).
dnmt3 family
 xxxg645xxx  and dnmt3b (fig. 2) exhibit dna
methyltransferase activity toward unmethylated as
well as hemimethylated substrate in vitro (49).
targeted gene deletion study reveals that  xxxg645xxx 
and dnmt3b are bona fide de novo dna methyltransferases (50). embryonic stem cells and
mouse embryo lacking these two genes are devoid
of de novo methylation (50). highly homologous
 xxxg645xxx  and dnmt3b exhibit overlapping as well as
distinct functions, as  xxxg645xxx  and dnmt3b double
knockout cells exhibit more severe phenotype than
individual null mutant. natural mutation of dnmt3b

has been identified in humans, which causes a severe neurological disease called immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial dysmorphy
syndrome (51, 52) (table iii). dnmt3b is overexpressed in various types of tumors (53).
all three dnmts play a causal role in silencing
of differentiation-promoting genes in cancer cells.
oncogenic transcription factor pml-rar, a fusion
protein formed specifically in leukemic cells, induces silencing of rar-beta2 by recruiting  xxxg645xxx 
and dnmt1 that methylate rar-beta2 promoter (54).
apart from the catalytic domain,  xxxg645xxx  and
dnmt3b also possess a relatively large n-terminal
region that harbors a pwwp domain and an
 xxxg225xxx  domain (fig. 2). pwwp domain is characterized by the presence of highly conserved proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline motif. pwwp
domain of  xxxg645xxx  and dnmt3b targets these enzymes to pericentromeric chromatin (55). this domain of dnmt3b can bind to dna in vitro and tar-

get  xxxg645xxx /3b to the chromatin (56). deletion of
this domain does not affect its enzymatic activity
(55, 57).
the  xxxg225xxx  domain is another motif shared by
all dnmt3 family members. it is characterized by a
conserved cys4-his-cys3 zinc-binding motif first
identified in  xxxg225xxx , a member of the swi/snf family of chromatin-remodeling proteins. mutation of
this gene causes  xxxg225xxx  syndrome (thalassemia,
mental retardation, x-linked syndrome) (58).  xxxg225xxx 
domain of dnmt3 family has been shown to interact with histone deacetylases and other chromatinremodeling factors as well as transcriptional regulators (59, 60) (fig. 2).
 xxxg645xxx  associates with chromatin-remodeling
factor  xxxg2173xxx , methyl-cpg-binding protein mbd3 and
histone methyltransferase in lymphocytoma cells
(61). the direct interaction of  xxxg645xxx  with  xxxg2173xxx 
and mbd3, in particular, represses metallothionein1 promoter activity (62). hp1alpha and histone-modifying enzymes such as deacetylases and methylases (hdacs, hmts) may facilitate the repressor
function of dnmts through the formation of transcriptionally inert heterochromatin (63, 64).
 xxxg645xxx  also interacts with setdb1 that methylates histone h3 at lysine 9 (k9), a marker for repressed chromatin (65).
dnmt3l (dnmt3-like) is the third member of the
dnmt3 family (66). it does not manifest any catalytic activity due to lack of catalytic motifs (fig. 2).
dnmt3l is highly expressed during gametogenesis
(67, 68). loss of dnmt3l causes failure to establish maternal imprinting in the oocyte and paternal
imprinting during spermatogenesis (67, 69, 70).
dnmt3l is involved in germ cell reprogramming
through its interaction with  xxxg645xxx  and dnmt3b.
dnmt3l stimulates de novo dna methyltransferase activity of  xxxg645xxx  and dnmt3b through its
c-terminal domain. strikingly higher expression of
dnmt3l and dnmt3b is detected during oogenesis
whereas  xxxg645xxx  co-localizes with dnmt3l during
spermatogenesis (68, 71). taken together, these
observations implicate the functional specificity of
the dnmt3 family in paternal/maternal imprinting.
dnmts act in concert to methylate
and silence genes in mammals
dna methylation is established and maintained
by the de novo and maintenance dna methyltransferases acting in concert. dnmt1–/– mouse
embryonic stem cells are viable and are able to
maintain a low but stable level of dna methylation

 xxxd1823xxx 
(32, 72).  xxxg645xxx  and dnmt3b null embryonic stem
cells exhibit more severe phenotype than individual null mutant (50, 73). coexpression of  xxxg645xxx 
and dnmt1 results in genome-wide hypermethylation and lethality in drosophila (74). the physiological association of dnmt1 with  xxxg645xxx  and 3b
has been determined by biochemical and functional studies (61, 75). in addition, functional cooperation among dnmt3 family members is essential for
germ cell development (68).
in human colon cancer cells (hct116) dnmt1
and dnmt3b cooperate to maintain dna methylation pattern of genes involved in tumorigenesis,
such as p16 and timp3 (76). methylation-mediated silencing of ribosomal rna repeats in cancer
cells require both dnmt1 and dnmt3b (77).
dnmts negatively regulate gene expression
independent of dna methylation
in the course of evolution mammalian dnmts
acquired a large n-terminal domain that is absent
in prokaryotic enzymes. the n-terminal domain of
dnmt1 harbors a variety of motifs involved in dna
binding and interaction with a variety of transcriptional repressors and co-repressors such as
dmap1 (dnmt1-associated protein 1), rb and
hdac1/2 (78) (fig. 2). similarly,  xxxg645xxx  is recruited by the transcriptional repressor rp58 to suppress its target genes by histone deacetylation
(60). recently, we have shown that dnmt3b is essential for ngf-induced neuronal differentiation in
pc12 cells, and it recruits  xxxg1034xxx  to repress its target genes (64, 79).
all of the dnmt3 family of proteins ( xxxg645xxx , 3b
and 3l) possess  xxxg225xxx  domain, which is essential
for their repressor activity (59, 60, 64). this domain
recruits a variety of chromatin-modifying factors
such as rbap58, hdacs,  xxxg2173xxx ,  xxxg2173xxx , heterochromatin protein 1alpha (hp1alpha and suv39h1, a histone k9
methyltransferase (fig. 2). some of these factors
are transcriptional co-repressors (rbap58),
whereas others inhibit gene expression by altering
post-translational modifications of histone tails
(hdacs, suv39h1, setdb1) or atp-dependent
chromatin remodeling ( xxxg2173xxx ,  xxxg2173xxx ). thus, apart
from methylation of cytosines, mammalian dnmts
can also act as transcriptional repressors by virtue
of their large n-terminal regions that recruit a variety of co-repressors and chromatin-remodeling enzymes without involving their methyltransferase
activity. this unique property of mammalian dnmts
probably explains why a large number of unmethylated promoters are also activated in cells treated

with  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors due to depletion of the key
protein dnmt1 (80). it would be of interest to identify genes that are predominantly regulated by
 xxxg644xxx -mediated transcriptional suppression.
methylation-mediated gene silencing requires
participation of multiprotein complexes involving
methyl-cpg–binding proteins, histone-modifying
enzymes and chromatin-remodeling factors
binding of only a few transcription factors such
as ap2, creb, usf and c-myc to cognate sites
are impeded by cpg methylation (13, 81). the majority of the methylated genes are recognized by
one or more members of a family of proteins designated as methyl-cpg–binding proteins (fig. 3).
these proteins harbor a signature methyl-cpg
binding domain in n-terminal region and transcriptional repressor domain at their c-termini (82–84).
among these proteins, mbd2 specifically binds to
methylated dna whereas mbd3 binds exclusively
to unmethylated dna. therefore, apart from mbd
other domains of these proteins are involved in
their dna recognition property. in contrast,

mecp2,  xxxg649xxx  and mbd4 can interact with dna irrespective of its methylation status. a zinc-finger
protein kaiso without any signature mbd binds to
methylated promoters to repress their expression
(81). these proteins recruit different co-repressor
complexes that include histone deacetylases
(hdac1/2), sin3a, hbrm to silence methylated promoters (fig. 3a). thus, mbds recruit both histonemodifying enzymes and chromatin-remodeling factors to form compact chromatin structure on
methylated promoters. this prevents the accessibility of transcription factors to the promoter, resulting in gene silencing. methylation-mediated
gene silencing appears to be irreversible without
therapeutic interventions.
polycomb group (pcg) proteins are components of conserved repressor complexes (prc)
that determine and maintain cell identity by epigenetically silencing several loci in the genome (85).
prc2 and prc3 appear to be involved in initiating
silencing, whereas prc1 is required for the stable
maintenance of the repressive state on specific
target loci. recently it has been shown that dnmts

fig. 3. mechanism of methylation-mediated gene silencing.

404
can directly induce repressive chromatin structure
by directly interacting with enhancer of  xxxd2044xxx  2
( xxxg739xxx ), a component of prc2 and prc3 repressor complex (85) (fig. 3b). histone h3 k-27
methyltransferase activity of  xxxg739xxx  and dna
methyltransferase activity of dnmts act together
for efficient epigenetic silencing. thus, heritable silenced state of chromatin is maintained by cooperative interaction between histone methyltransferases and dna methyltransferases.
aberrant methylation of critical genes
in cancer cells is an attractive target
for epigenetic therapy
a relatively large number of human diseases
are caused either due to mutations in the components of dna methylation machinery or altered
methylation profile of specific regions of the
genome affecting the expression of surrounding
genes (table iii). for example, mutations in
mecp2 and dnmt3b are correlated to rett and
icf syndromes, respectively. aberrations in
methylation in affected genes are linked to many
imprinting disorders (some of which are summarized in table iii). detailed information on dna
methylation–related diseases is available in some
recent reviews (86). in this review we will focus on
the role of dna methylation in various human malignancies.
studies of the “methylome” (methylation profile
of the genome) (87–89) in primary human tumors
have established that promoter hypermethylation,
like mutation, can be one or both “hits” in
knudson’s two-hit theory of carcinogenesis (26,
90, 91). it is, therefore, likely that the characterization of cancer cell methylome will identify many
more novel tumor suppressor genes. aberration in
genomic dna methylation patterns was the first
epigenetic abnormality identified in human cancers. genome-wide analysis of methylation profile
revealed that de novo methylation occurs in almost
all types of cancer, and promoter methylation does
not occur at random. only certain genes like p16,
p15, e-cad,  xxxg1932xxx , rassf1a, timp-3, mlh1,
er and ptpro are methylated in different tumor
types, whereas methylation of certain genes is
unique to specific cancer types (table iv).
silencing of the majority of these genes is advantageous for tumor cell growth, survival, invasion
and metastasis to other tissues.
although it was known for a long time that 5methyl cytosine content of tumor cell genome is
significantly reduced, its potential role in malignant

 xxxd1823xxx 
transformation has only started to emerge (for review, see ref. 92). tumor-specific demethylation of
repeat sequences (line-1, satalpha and sat2),
imprinted genes (igf2,  xxxg420xxx ) and tissue-specific genes (cancer-testis antigens), and genes involved in invasion and metastasis ( xxxg421xxx , tpa) are
frequently observed in different malignancies.
demethylation of repeat elements leads to chromosomal instability due to spurious recombination
whereas that of imprinted genes leads to biallelic
expression or suppression. that dna hypomethylation indeed plays a causal role in malignant transformation has been shown in mice hypomorphic
for dnmt1 (described below). whether tumor
genome is passively (loss of methylation due to
lack of methylation of the newly replicated dna) or
actively (in absence of dna replication) demethylated is yet to be determined. although mbd2 has
been shown to be an active demethylase its role
as an enzyme is still being debated (93).
genes methylated in mds
many genes are de novo methylated in mds
(table iv). in mds, methylation of p15/ xxxg422xxx  is
common and is associated with poor prognosis
and transition from mds to aml (94–98). the p15
promoter was demethylated and p15 protein was
elevated in a number of patients treated with
 xxxd1823xxx , implicating its potential usage as a
prognostic marker (99). the  xxxg797xxx  was methylated
in 13 of 94 aml cases and 22 of 40 mds cases,
but not in normal mononuclear cells (100). both
the frequency and density of methylation increased in the advanced mds and the relapsed
aml cases. although methylation of  xxxg797xxx  and p15
was not correlated in mds and aml, increased
 xxxg797xxx  methylation at the relapse in aml was associated with p15 methylation (100). methylation of
rassf1a was observed in 5 of 55 (9%) mds cases, but not in any of 57 aml cases studied.  xxxg1895xxx  methylation was present in 13 of 121 (11%) aml
cases but was not found in mds. socs-1 promoter methylation was present in 8 of 74 mds patients
(101). p21/ xxxg418xxx , p27/ xxxg419xxx  and p57/ xxxg420xxx  genes
were not methylated in any of mds samples tested (102). genome-wide analysis of the methylation profile in mds patients by techniques such as
restriction landmark genome scanning analysis
with methylation sensitive enzymes (rlgs-m)
(103, 104), methylated dna immunoprecipitation
followed by promoter microarray (mdip) (105) or
differential methylation hybridization (dmh) (106,
107) will identify many more genes that can be

play key roles during tumorigenesis by modulating
the methylome.

studies with mutant mice revealed
that both genome-wide hypomethylation
and gene-specific hypermethylation might cause
tumorigenesis
dnmt1, 3a and 3b are frequently upregulated in
cancer cells and are associated with poor prognosis in some cancers (108–115). it remains to be established whether upregulation of dnmts is a
cause or consequence of rapid division of cancer
cells. recently, several dnmt1 hypomorphic mice
(dnmt1n/+, dnmt1r/+, dnmt1n/r, dnmt1chip/+ and
dnmt1chip/–) were generated expressing variable
levels of dnmt1 less than the wild-type mice were
generated (116–120). most of these mice are developmentally normal and fertile. these mice when
crossed to apcmin/+ mice resulted in suppression of
intestinal polyp formation (116, 118) and reduction
in the frequency of cpg island methylation in both
normal intestinal mucosa and intestinal adenomas
(120). in contrast, dnmt1n/r x mlh1–/– mice, although resistant to colorectal cancer, are more
prone to spontaneous lymphomagenesis (119).
hypermethylation of some tumor suppressor
genes such as timp3, p16, mgmt that occur in the
polyps of apcmin/+ mice are significantly reduced by
crossing with dnmt1 hypomorphic mice. although
dnmt1 hypomorphic allele reduced adenoma formation in the colon of apc/min mice, it predisposes them to liver tumorigenesis due to apc loss of
heterozygosity (116). thus, loss of dnmt1 exerts
different biological effects in different tissues.
these observations suggest that reduced level of
dnmt1 prevents tumor growth by hypermethylation
of growth-regulatory genes.
severe loss of dnmt1 activity can also induce
tumorigenesis in mice. hypomorphic mice expressing only 10% of the wild-type dnmt1 level
demonstrate substantial loss of dna methylation
in all tissues (118). spontaneous aggressive t-cell
lymphomagenesis in dnmt1chip/– mice demonstrates that genome-wide hypomethylation can also lead to neoplastic transformation, probably due
to activation of proviral genes, and chromosomal
instability caused by spurious recombination of
centromeric repeats. like dnmt1, conditional deletion of dnmt3b in apcmin/+ mice suppresses intestinal neoplasia by inhibiting transition from microadenoma formation to macroscopic colonic tumor growth (121). thus, both dnmt1 and dnmt3b

 xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx 
as anticancer drugs
 xxxd253xxx  and 5-aza-2'- xxxd1836xxx  (fig.
4) were first synthesized four decades earlier and
tested as a nucleoside analogue against aml (for
review, see refs. 122–127).  xxxd253xxx  or
 xxxd1823xxx  was tried against beta-thalassemia, sickle
cell anemia, leukemias (cml, aml, myelodysplasia) and a variety of solid tumors. however, these
drugs were most effective against liquid tumors
such as advanced myelodysplastic syndrome, cml
and aml (124, 128, 129). the number of clinical trials of these cytosine analogues on solid tumors is
relatively small (130–132). here we describe the
molecular mechanism and biological functions of
these drugs and the results of their clinical trials.

depleting the functional enzyme

within the cells, both  xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx  are acted upon by a battery of cellular enzymes to 2-dexy- xxxd253xxx -triphosphate that
gets incorporated instead of dctp during replication by dna polymerases (fig. 4). excessive incorporation of these analogues can lead to inhibition of dna synthesis resulting in cell cycle arrest
and ultimately cell death (122). but differentiation
of leukemic cells to mature blood cells is a more
desirable clinical outcome than cell death.
the catalytic mechanism of dna (c5) methyltransferases involves formation of a covalent bond
between a cysteine residue in the pcq motif in the
active site of the enzyme and carbon 6 of cytosine
in dna (fig. 5), which facilitates the nucleophilic
attack of carbon 5 on the methyl group of  xxxd3156xxx .
removal of a proton from c5 followed by beta-elimination allows reformation of the 56 double bond releasing the enzyme and dna with a methylated cytosine (fig. 5). santi et al. (133) proposed a mechanism explaining the inhibitory effects of the
cytosine analogues. according to them, a covalent
bond formed between the enzyme and c6 position
of  xxxd1823xxx -incorporated dna could not be reversed due to replacement of c5 by n5 in azanucleosides, resulting in the entrapment of the enzyme into dna. it is believed that the mammalian

dnmts use a similar mechanism for methyl transfer
and are inhibited by  xxxd1823xxx  in the same manner as the bacterial enzyme, since these enzymes
share a set of conserved catalytic domain motifs
(reviewed in ref. 122). at low concentration  xxxd1823xxx  forms covalent adduct with dnmts, which
cannot get methylated at the complimentary cpg
in the newly synthesized strand, due to lack of
functional enzymes. after two or more rounds of
replication both strands of dna are demethylated,
allowing the transcription factors to activate gene
expression. activation of many methylated genes
by both  xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx  indicates that
both drugs are equally effective as demethylating
agents (134–142).
 xxxd253xxx  also affects rna processing and
translation due to its enzymatic conversion to
triphosphate, which is incorporated efficiently into
rna (fig. 4). inhibition of rrna methylation blocks
its processing, stalling ribosome production.
similarly, amino-acylation of trna requires its
methylation. thus,  xxxd253xxx  can also inhibit
protein biosynthesis (122).
treatment of cells with high concentration of
 xxxd1823xxx  results in cytotoxicity probably because

of excessive incorporation into dna that can interfere with dna replication or transcription due to
 xxxg644xxx –dna adduct formation. incorporation into
dna can activate the p53 dna damage response
pathway, resulting in growth arrest or apoptotic cell
death due to upregulation of p21 (143). therefore,
these drugs are expected to be more effective in
cancers such as cml, where p53 is functional.
alternatively, excessive incorporation of  xxxd1823xxx 
can potentially alter chromatin structure inhibiting
cellular functions.
induction of proteasomal degradation of dnmt1
several observations indicated that the trapping of dnmt1 to  xxxd1823xxx -incorporated dna –
depleting the functional enzyme and resulting in
dna hypomethylation during successive replication cycles – is not the only mechanism of action of
the drug in mammalian cells. first,  xxxg644xxx  activity
decreases much faster than its incorporation into
dna in  xxxd1823xxx -treated cells (144). second,
among three dnmts, only dnmt1 is rapidly and selectively degraded in mammalian cells in response
to dna methyltransferase inhibitors (145, 146), although all three dnmts have conserved pcq motif

408

in their catalytic sites (29). continued degradation
of the catalytic site (cys to ser) mutant of dnmt1
that lacks the ability to form covalent bond with c6
of  xxxd1823xxx -incorporated dna further supports
this notion (37). third,  xxxd253xxx , whose incorporation into dna is significantly less than that of
 xxxd1823xxx , is equally efficient in inducing degradation of dnmt1 (fig. 6). the  xxxd1823xxx -induced depletion of dnmt1 occurs even in the presence of a
potent inhibitor of dna synthesis, such as aphidicolin, indicating that  xxxd1823xxx -induced degradation can occur independent of dna replication.
fifth, in  xxxd1823xxx -resistant cells the drug gets
equally incorporated into the dna as in sensitive
cells (147), suggesting that resistance is probably
because of inability of dnmt1 to undergo degradation by proteasomal pathway. identification of the
signaling pathway activated by  xxxd1823xxx  or 5azacytidine to trigger dnmt1 degradation may enable us to design demethylating agents with minimal toxicity due to lack of their incorporation into
dna.
methylation-independent function of  xxxd1823xxx : affecting chromatin structure
several observations suggested that although
 xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx  are designated as

demethylating agents, the biological and clinical
outcome does not always correlate with promoter
hypomethylation. first, in some mds patients remission is observed without p15/ xxxg422xxx  hypomethylation (149, 150). second, microarray
analysis of cancer cells revealed that not only
methylated genes but also many unmethylated
promoters are activated, upon treatment with
 xxxd1823xxx  (80). the most plausible explanation for
this is that the unmethylated genes are the downstream targets of methylated genes. alternatively,
these genes are activated by some yet unidentified
mechanisms. to identify such pathways affected
by  xxxd1823xxx , gius et al. (151) compared gene expression profile of colon cancer cells treated with
the drug with that of dnmt1 null hct116 cells. the
results showed that the majority of the genes activated in the drug-treated cells were distinct from
that of dnmt1 null cells, implicating that the drug
action is not solely mediated through inactivating
dnmt1. many of the genes activated by  xxxd1823xxx 
were methylation-free, suggesting that these drugs
might also affect cellular pathways other than inhibiting dna methylation. in contrast, many genes
derepressed by  xxxd1823xxx  are also activated by inhibitors of hdacs, such as  xxxd3426xxx ,  xxxd1841xxx  or  xxxd3485xxx . the likely explanation

k. ghoshal and s. bai

fig. 6. among three dna methyltransferases (dnmts),
only dnmt1 is degraded in cells treated with  xxxd253xxx  (azac). tsa =  xxxd3426xxx . reproduced from ref.

microbiology © 2002.

for this is that both drugs activate gene expression
by relaxing chromatin structure;  xxxd1823xxx  by hypomethylation of dna that often results in replacement of inhibitory nucleosomes harboring hypoacetylated, k9-, k27-methylated h3 by transcriptionally active nucleosomes (hyperacetylated,
k4-methylated) (152–154). surprisingly, a large
number of genes were suppressed in spite of hypomethylation upon  xxxd1823xxx  treatment (80).
these results point toward the notion that availability of transcription factors, methylation state of
the promoter as well as both localized and higherordered chromatin structure play critical roles in
gene activation after treatment with demethylating
agents.
synergistic activation of methylated promoters after combined treatment of cancer cells with inhibitors of  xxxg644xxx  and hdac suggests that the combination therapy might be more promising than either agent alone
cameron et al. (155) made a unique observation of robust activation of methylated and silenced
tumor suppressor genes in a colon cancer cell line
(rko), which was subsequently confirmed by
many other groups including ours (145). the high
level of induction occurred in cancer cells pretreated with a very low dose (0.1 µm) of  xxxd1823xxx  for
shorter time (24 hours) followed by treatment with

409
hdac inhibitor ( xxxd3426xxx ) for an additional 12
hours. in contrast, activation by  xxxd253xxx 
alone required at least 10-fold more of the inhibitor
and two to four days.  xxxd3426xxx  alone could not
activate methylated genes. we explored the detailed molecular mechanism for this synergistic activation using metallothionein-1 as a model gene
that is methylated and silenced in lymphosarcoma
cells (145). results showed that only a few cpgs
were demethylated by  xxxd253xxx  treatment
alone, whereas  xxxd3426xxx  alone had no effect.
open-chromatin structure formed due to histone
hyperacetylation, dissociation of repressor–co-repressor complexes such as mbds, dnmts and increased expression of a transactivator resulted in
synergistic gene activation. a lot of attention has
now been focused on clinical trials of these two
types of inhibitors in combination therapy
(156–168).
clinical trials of  xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd253xxx 
in cancer patients
low dose of  xxxd1823xxx  appears to be more
promising against leukemia in clinical trials
 xxxd1823xxx  has been undergoing clinical trials
as an antineoplastic agent since the 1960s. in earlier clinical trials, a relatively high dose of  xxxd1823xxx  was used, which often led to toxicity. in contrast, it appeared to be more promising when
patients with hematologic disorders were administered a relatively low dose for a relatively longer
time period. this is because tumor cell dna gets
hypomethylated postreplication if allowed to grow
in the presence of low doses of these drugs (10,
99, 150, 169–172). in a phase ii trial comprising 66
patients, the overall response rate was 49% and
complete remission rate was 20%, when  xxxd1823xxx  was administered at 45 mg/m2/day for three
days (171). cytogenetic abnormality was also reduced in 31% of the patients, belonging to all ipss
groups (table ii).
since at high doses  xxxd1823xxx  causes severe
myelosuppression in patients, a phase i study was
conducted to optimize the effective dose with minimum toxicity (150, 170). in this study the drug was
administered intravenously to 50 leukemic patients
at doses of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg/m2 for one hour per
day for 10 or 15 days (50–300 mg/m2 per course).
complete and partial remission were observed in
nine patients (18%) and one patient (2%), respectively, with an overall response rate of 32%.
maximal response was observed in 11 out of 17

410
patients (65%) at a dose of 15 mg/m2/day. the
overall response rate was also higher in aml patients with lower doses (150).
a randomized phase ii study of a low dose of
 xxxd1823xxx  was next performed in patients with
mds (99, 173, 174). seventy-seven patients with
mds and 18 with cmmol were subjected to different treatment regimens of  xxxd1823xxx : i) 20 mg/m2
intravenously daily for five days; ii) 20 mg/m2 subcutaneously daily for five days; and iii) 10 mg/m2
intravenously daily for 10 days. overall, 32 patients (34%) achieved complete remission and 69
(72%) had an objective response (9). the five-day
intravenous schedule, which had the highest dose
intensity, was found to be most effective; the complete remission rate in group 1 was 39%, compared to 21% in group 2 and 24% in group 3 (p
<0.05). maximal hypomethylation of p15 promoter
was observed in the high-dose-intensity group and
induction of p15 expression at days 12 or 28 after
therapy. the results showed that a low dose of the
drug (100–150 mg/m2/course) injected over a
shorter period of time was optimal for epigenetic
modulation and clinical responses in mds.
a randomized phase iii clinical trial was conducted at m.d. anderson cancer center in which
170 mds patients were treated with  xxxd1823xxx 
(45 mg/m2/day for three days every six weeks) or
supportive care only (99). these patients met fab
(table i) and ipss (table ii) classification criteria.
among them, 89 patients were randomly selected
for  xxxd1823xxx  therapy plus supportive care and 81
were provided with supportive care alone.
 xxxd1823xxx  therapy was repeated every six weeks,
depending on the patient's clinical response and
toxicity. supportive care consisted of blood transfusions, antibiotics and hematopoietic growth factors. the overall response rate (complete remission plus partial remission) and time to transition to
aml or death were chosen as primary endpoints of
the study. secondary endpoints included improved
hematopoiesis, duration of remission, cytogenetic
response rate, requirements for blood transfusion,
quality of life, survival and safety.
the overall response rate in the  xxxd1823xxx 
study group was 17% with the median response
duration of 288 days, compared to 0% in the supportive care arm (p <0.001). the complete response rate of 9% and a partial response rate of
8% were observed. the overall response rate was
21% in  xxxd1823xxx -treated patients. in addition,
13% of patients had hematologic improvement,

 xxxd1823xxx 
compared to 7% of patients in the supportive care
group.  xxxd1823xxx  was found to be better than the
supportive care in improving quality of life and
global health of patients.
two additional clinical trials were performed to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of  xxxd1823xxx  in
patients with mds of any fab subtype. the results
of the phase ii studies were consistent with the results of the phase iii trial with overall response
rates of 26% (n = 66) and 24% (n = 98). the major clinical benefit of  xxxd1823xxx  is that it is a new
treatment option for mds patients, eliminating the
need for frequent blood transfusions.
a recently completed three-year study led by
kantarjian et al. (99, 174, 175), tried a different
dosing schedule of  xxxd1823xxx  to treat mds and
cmmol. in this study 72% (69 of 95 patients)
showed partial response, whereas 34% (32 patients) showed complete remission.
combination therapy with  xxxd1823xxx  and hdac
inhibitors is effective against leukemia
robust activation of tumor suppressor genes
methylated and silenced in cancer cells after treatment with inhibitors of dnmts and hdacs (for review, see ref. 176) led oncologists to treat patients
with this combination therapy.  xxxd1823xxx  and  xxxd3485xxx  (an hdac inhibitor) were used in phase
i/ii clinical trial in patients with advanced leukemia.
fifty-four patients were treated with  xxxd1823xxx  (15
mg/m2/day intravenously for 10 days) along with
increasing doses of  xxxd3485xxx  for 10 days. a 50
mg/kg daily oral dose of  xxxd3485xxx  was found to
be safe. twenty-two percent of patients had objective response, among whom 10 had complete remission (19%) and 2 (3%) had complete remission
with incomplete platelet recovery. among 10 elderly patients with aml or mds, 5 (50%) had a response (4 complete remission, 1 complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery). induction
mortality was observed in 1 (2%) patient. major cytogenetic response was documented in 6 of 8 responders. remission duration ranged from 1.3 to
12.6 months. overall survival in responders was
15.3 months (range 4.6–20.2 months). transient
dna hypomethylation, global histone h3 and h4
acetylation were associated with increased p15
expression. patients with lower levels of p15
methylation before starting the regimen had a significantly higher response rate.

k. ghoshal and s. bai
conclusions
 xxxd1823xxx  manifests some adverse effects on
patients that include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
and myelosuppression. small molecule inhibitors
of dna methyltransferases have the potential to
form mutagenic lesions. the stability of these
drugs in vivo is very low. one relatively stable
drug,  xxxd3551xxx , which requires much higher concentration for promoter demethylation, is undergoing preclinical trial (177). development of better inhibitors of dnmts for clinical use is vigorously being pursued by supergen. a better understanding
of how mechanism-based inhibitors interact with
dna methyltransferases should facilitate design of
small molecule inhibitors of dnmts that induce facilitated degradation of one or more dnmts without
getting incorporated into dna.
a potential pitfall of the usage of dna hypomethylating drugs is that they might lead to undesirable activation of growth-promoting, antiapoptotic or metastatic genes. once a cancer-specific epigenome profile can be established by high
throughput assays, targeted demethylation and
activation of specific genes by therapeutic intervention may be the method of choice for epigenetic therapy.
