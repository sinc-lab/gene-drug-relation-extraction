protein c, inhibits coagulation and inflammation and promotes fibrinolysis in patients with severe sepsis.
850 patients with severe sepsis treated with intravenous
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mu g/kg/h for 96 hours had a
significantly greater reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality
(24.7%) than 840 placebo recipients (30.8%) in a
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. the
drug was associated with a 19.4% reduction in the relative
risk of death at 28 days compared with placebo.
baseline characteristics of and pre-existing conditions in
patients with sepsis appeared to have no effect on the efficacy of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated).
a significantly greater reduction in median percentage
change from baseline plasma d-dimer levels (a coagulation
marker) was seen with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) treatment than with placebo on study days 1 to 7 in patients with
severe sepsis. on study days 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7, a significantly
greater median reduction in interleukin-6 levels (an inflammation marker) from baseline was seen with drotrecogin
alfa (activated) treatment than placebo.
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) was associated with an increased incidence of serious bleeding events during the infusion period [2.4% vs 1.0% with placebo; p = 0.024] and
the 28-day study period (3.5 vs 2.0%; p = 0.06) of the efficacy trial. this increase was primarily related to procedurerelated events; there were no significant differences between
the treatment groups in nonprocedure-related serious
bleeding events. the most frequent site of bleeding was the
gastrointestinal tract.
with the exception of bleeding events, there were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups in
the efficacy trial in the incidence of adverse events.
of the 210 deaths in patients with severe sepsis treated with
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mu g/kg/h in the efficacy trial,
four deaths due to haemorrhage and one due to cerebral
oedema were possibly related to the study drug.

a systemic inflammatory and procoagulant response to infection may result in sepsis and, if associated with acute organ dysfunction, severe sepsis.[1,2] recent estimates indicate approximately
750 000 patients with severe sepsis in the us every
year with a mortality rate approaching 30% despite
advances in supportive care.[3] in europe, approximately 146 000 deaths annually are associated
with severe sepsis.[4] the aging and increasingly
immunocompromised population, increasing use
of invasive devices and procedures, and increased
rate of antibacterial resistance have led to an increase in the incidence of this syndrome.[5]
severe sepsis involves a complex cascade of
events associated with three integrated components: inflammation, coagulation and impaired fibrinolysis.[6-12] infection leads to the stimulation of
proinflammatory cytokines resulting in endothelial
dysfunction and changes in the thrombogenicity of
the endothelium of the vascular bed.[9-11,13] this
triggers coagulation and thrombin formation
which, in turn, amplify inflammation and coagulation, continuing the cycle of events.[10-12] the nor© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

mal fibrinolytic response is decreased, and this
contributes to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) and microvascular
thrombosis.[6,10,12] although the underlying infectious process may be controlled, coagulopathy and
dic can become increasingly more severe, which
may lead to acute multiple organ dysfunction and
death.[8,10,11]
endogenous protein c is converted to activated
protein c (see structure[14]), a modulator of inflammation, thrombosis and fibronolysis, in an attempt
to restore homeostasis in patients with severe sepsis.[9-11,15] however, endogenous protein c is rapidly depleted and levels of protein c may be deficient preceding the clinical diagnosis of sepsis and
may remain depleted throughout the course of the
syndrome.[16-19] a deficiency of protein c is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and
is seen in the majority of patients with severe sepsis.[18,20,21]
the presentation, type of causative pathogen,
course and treatment of the illness is similar in
adult and paediatric patients.[22] symptoms that
indicate a systemic inflammatory response, leading
to coagulopathy, hypotension and ultimately organ
failure and death, are seen in both adults and children. in children, age sensitive adjustments in vital
signs such as heart and respiratory rate are required
in the diagnostic criteria. although the absolute
amount of some blood factors differs in adults and
children, baseline illness characteristics and abnormality of biomarker levels (e.g. d-dimer, protein c
and antithrombin levels) are comparable.
medical and surgical interventions to normalise
physiology and eliminate infection are standard
management approaches for patients with severe
sepsis.[2,23-25] antibacterial drugs, although essential, are not sufficient for the treatment of severe
sepsis[2,26] and may even precipitate or accelerate
the sepsis cascade by the release of microbial products.[27-29] prompt antibacterial therapy for the
causative pathogen is necessary; however, it is not
received by ≈10% of patients.[2,30] treatment is
hampered by antibacterial resistant organisms,
polymicrobial infections and occult infection

sites,[2,23] and by delayed diagnosis and inappropriate antibacterial therapy.[31]
increased understanding of the pathogenesis
of sepsis has led to numerous investigational
approaches for the treatment of this serious condition [e.g. bacterial modulators, anticytokines, antiinflammatory agents,  xxxd2738xxx  inhibitors and haemostatic agents (including recombinant human
 xxxg1847xxx )]. these investigations have
been previously reviewed.[5,32-34]
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) has been developed
for the treatment of severe sepsis and its efficacy
and tolerability have been evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trials in adults.[20,35] the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
the agent have been investigated in a noncomparative, multicentre trial in paediatric patients with
severe sepsis. the results of the tolerability[35] and
efficacy trials[20] have been published; however,
most of the information in this article has been
derived from the trials reported in the manufacturer’s briefing document for  xxxd1948xxx  (activated).[22]  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion.
1. pharmacodynamic profile
mechanism of action

•  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) acts in a similar
manner as endogenous  xxxg1847xxx , a serine
protease.[15,22] it slows the coagulation process in
the microvasculature by proteolytic inhibition of
coagulation factors va and viiia.[10] it reduces inflammation by indirectly inhibiting thrombinmediated inflammatory activities[11] and perhaps
by directly suppressing inflammatory cytokine production.[36,37] fibrinolysis is enhanced by drotrecogin
alfa (activated) by inhibiting thrombin production,
thrombin-mediated inflammation,  xxxg2058xxx  (pai-1) inhibition and release and
 xxxg503xxx  activation, and by acceleration of clot lysis by tissue plasminogen activator.[8,10,11,15,16]

619

• the binding of endogenous protein c to
 xxxg2277xxx  and  xxxg1848xxx  is required to activate the protein.[11,38-40] in severe sepsis, the conversion of protein c to activated
protein c may be impaired by generalised endothelial dysfunction and down-regulation of  xxxg2277xxx  by inflammatory cytokines; therefore, administration of  xxxg1847xxx  [drotrecogin
alfa (activated)], may be more effective than administration of protein c.[19,41]
animal studies

• in a baboon model of escherichia coli sepsis,
all of the animals receiving high-concentration infusions of  xxxg1847xxx  plus a lethal concentration of e. coli survived, whereas all the control
animals receiving the same infusions of e. coli died
of sepsis-related complications.[42]
• the antithrombotic, anticoagulant and profibrinolytic activity of  xxxg1847xxx  has been
demonstrated in experimental animal models. fibrinolysis was enhanced by  xxxg1847xxx 
through a direct inhibitory effect on pai-1 in rats
with dic.[43]  xxxg1847xxx  plus urokinase
had additive effects in increasing clot lysis[44] and
in preventing the accumulation of fibrin and platelets in animal models.[45]
• platelet thrombosis was inhibited by infusion of
 xxxg1847xxx  in baboon,[46] canine[47] and
rabbit models of acute arterial thrombosis. [48]  xxxg1847xxx  increased prothrombin time (pt)
in rabbits with meningococcal endotoxin shock[49]
and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt)
in a canine model of thrombosis.[47] in in vivo animal studies, little or no prolongation of bleeding
time was detected in association with activated
protein c administration.[43,46,47,50,51]

change over time and percentage change from
baseline in plasma d-dimer levels (normal range
0.0 to 0.39 mg/l) were measured in patients who
participated in the two randomised, double-blind,
drugs 2002; 62 (4)

620

• at the end of infusion, a statistically significant
(p ≤ 0.001) dose response was seen in median
changes in d-dimer levels of, respectively, –8.9,
4.4, –27.6, –45.9 and –0.4% from baseline for the
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 12 mug/kg/h (n = 21), 18
mug/kg/h (n = 21), 24 mug/kg/h (n = 22), 30 mug/kg/h
(n = 12) and placebo (n = 35) recipients (combination
of 48- and 96-hour infusion duration groups). [22]
• in patients with severe sepsis in the randomised,
placebo-controlled efficacy trial (section 3), recipients of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/kg/h for
96 hours had a significantly greater reduction in
median plasma d-dimer levels than placebo recipients on study days 1 to 7 (p ≤ 0.01 for all evaluation timepoints; figure 1).[22] baseline values were
obtained for >90% of patients in the efficacy
trial;[53] median baseline levels of d-dimer were
4.22 and 4.15 mg/l in the  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/kg/h for 96 hours (n = 792) and placebo recipients (n = 758), respectively.[20]
• longer periods of infusion of  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) may need evaluation, as d-dimer levels
rose after completion of the 96-hour infusion,
indicating incomplete resolution of the procoagulant state.[20] prothrombin f1.2 and thrombinantithrombin complex levels decreased to a significantly greater extent in patients treated with

 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) than in the placebo
group on study days 1, 2 and 4 (p < 0.001).[22]
• 87.6% of patients with severe sepsis in the efficacy trial (section 3) had deficient baseline
plasma protein c levels as defined by <81% plasma
protein c activity (normal range 81 to 173%).[20,22]
although both treatment groups displayed increases from baseline in endogenous protein c levels, the increases were significantly greater in the
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) than in the placebo recipients over study days 1 to 7 (p < 0.001 on days
1 to 6; p ≤ 0.003 on day 7).[22] nevertheless, even
with a median percentage increase of 43% in
protein c levels, 57% of survivors receiving
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/kg/h remained
protein c deficient on day 4 of the study.
• median percentage increases from baseline in
aptt were greater in patients with severe sepsis
treated with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) than in
those receiving placebo on study days 1 to 4 (p <
0.001 on each day) of the efficacy trial (section
3).[22] on study day 1, the median aptt increase
was ≈7 seconds, and aptt decreased thereafter. on
study days 5 to 7, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in aptt. this

median percentage change
from baseline d-dimer levels

placebo-controlled trials of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) [section 3].[20,22] d-dimer levels indicate coagulation has occurred in conjunction with fibrinolysis activation, forming fibrin breakdown
products.[52] a reduction in plasma d-dimer levels,
therefore, is evidence of a reduction in the procoagulant effects of sepsis. other biomarkers of
coagulation, thrombin generation and fibrinolysis,
were also measured.
• during the 48- or 96-hour infusion of drotrecogin
alfa (activated) in the dose-ranging trial (section
3),[22] the median percentage decrease in baseline
d-dimer levels was greater in the  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) 24 and 30 mug/kg/h recipients than in the
recipients of the lower doses of  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) or placebo (p ≤ 0.05 among treatment
groups at several timepoints).[22]

drugs 2002; 62 (4)

 xxxd1948xxx  (activated): new drug profile

rise of aptt during  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) administration is due to the anticoagulant pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. improvement in coagulopathy and decreased consumption of clotting
factors are indicated by the subsequent fall of
aptt.
• in healthy volunteers, whole blood aptt prolongation strongly correlated with  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) concentrations.[22] the prolongation of
aptt may vary during infusion of the agent; therefore, the status of coagulopathy in the patient
should not be monitored by aptt during infusion
of the agent.[54]
• in contrast, pt weakly correlated with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) concentrations with differences of <3 seconds from baseline in healthy volunteers.[22] this minimal effect on pt is consistent
with the anticoagulant pharmacodynamic effect of
the agent;[22] therefore, pt may be used to assess
the status of coagulopathy in patients with severe
sepsis during  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) infusion.[54] between the two groups in the efficacy
trial, the magnitude of difference in median pts
was about 1 second.[22]
• paediatric patients [0 to <1 year (n = 16), 1 to
<8 years (n = 25) and 8 to <18 years (n = 15 or 16)]
with severe sepsis treated with  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) 24 mug/kg/h for 96 hours showed similar
changes in protein c activity, d-dimer and antithrombin activity levels in the nonblind trial to
those observed in adults in the efficacy trial (section 3).[22]

621

decrease in il-6 levels with active treatment than
with placebo is indicative of anti-inflammatory activity.
• during the 48-hour infusion of  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) in the dose-ranging trial (section 3), the
median percentage decrease in il-6 levels was
greater in the  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 30 mg/
kg/h group on days 1 and 3 (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02,
respectively) than in the other treatment groups.[22]
no significant differences in il-6 levels were observed during the 96-hour infusion. at the end of
the infusion, a statistically significant dose response (p = 0.021) was demonstrated by the median percentage changes in il-6 levels of –42.5,
–57.4, –68.8, –86.4 and –45.9% from baseline for
infusions of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 12, 18, 24
and 30 ug/kg/h and placebo, respectively (combination of the 48- and 96-hour infusion duration
groups).
• in the randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled efficacy trial (section 3), median il-6
levels decreased from baseline significantly more
rapidly with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/
kg/h for 96 hours than placebo on study day 1 (p =
0.01) and on days 4 to 7 (p = 0.02) in patients with
severe sepsis (figure 2).[22] at entry into the study,
il-6 levels were elevated in 98.5% of patients with
severe sepsis for whom values were obtained with
median baseline levels of 497 and 484 ng/l in the
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) [n = 827] and placebo
(n = 808) treatment groups, respectively.[20,22]
2. pharmacokinetic profile

effects on inflammation markers
in patients with sepsis

levels of serum interleukin-6 (il-6), a proinflammatory cytokine released during the systemic
inflammatory response, were measured in the two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (section 3).[20,35] normal levels of this
inflammation marker range from 0.38 to 10.09
ng/l[20] and the risk of mortality increases with the
increased level of il-6 at the presentation of
sepsis.[22] in patients with severe sepsis, a more rapid

eight phase i studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics of intravenous  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
in healthy male and female individuals, healthy individuals pretreated with aspirin, women with low
serum estrogen levels and patients with end-stage
renal impairment undergoing dialysis.[22] in general, there were no significant differences in the
pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) between healthy individuals and those in
other groups. unless otherwise noted, values pertain to a homogeneous group of healthy volunteers

receiving infusions of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
at a rate of 24 mug/kg/h for 24 hours (n = 78 doses).
plasma concentrations at steady state (css) and
plasma clearance (cl) of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in patients with severe sepsis were evaluated
in the phase ii and iii studies (section 3).[22] preliminary pharmacokinetic data are available for
paediatric patients (aged 1 day to 17 years) with
severe sepsis who received  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/kg/h for 96 hours in an ongoing nonblind, noncomparative, multicentre trial.
• because of its short hybrid plasma half-life (t1⁄2) of
0.69 hours,  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) rapidly attains css during constant-rate infusion in healthy
volunteers.[22] seventy-nine percent of the area under
the plasma concentration-time curve is accounted
for by the rapid initial half-life phase (t1⁄2alpha) of 13
minutes. the time involved to move from 90 to 100%
of css is controlled by the second phase (t1⁄2beta) of 1.6
hours. within 40 minutes of starting a constant-rate
infusion of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated), approximately 75% of css is reached; within 1.8 hours,
90% of css is reached.

• css of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) is proportional to infusion rate with an expected css of 72.4
mug/l at an infusion rate of 24 mug/kg/h in healthy
volunteers.[22] however, in patients with severe
sepsis treated with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24
mug/kg/h for 96 hours in the efficacy study (n = 843
samples for 326 patients), median css was 44.9
mug/l.[22]
• the small volume of distribution of drotrecogin
alfa (activated) at steady state (17.6l) approximates extracellular volume and is attributable to its
high molecular weight and resultant inability to
penetrate membranes.[22]
• the infusion rate or infusion duration of
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) does not alter its cl of
26.0 l/h in healthy volunteers. however, median
cl of the drug was 40.1 l/h in patients with severe
sepsis in the efficacy study. this increase in cl
results in the lower css seen in patients with severe
sepsis than in healthy volunteers.
• in healthy volunteers,  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
is inhibited by several plasma  xxxg745xxx  inhibitors (e.g.  xxxg2052xxx ,  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -antitrypsin,
 xxxg831xxx -antiplasmin, pai-1) resulting in rapid elimination and a short t1⁄2alpha (13 minutes).[19,55-57] the time
required to eliminate the final 21% of drotrecogin
alfa (activated) infused during treatment is governed by the t1⁄2beta of 1.6 hours.[22] within 40 minutes,
1.8 hours and 4.5 hours of stopping an infusion,
approximately 75, 90 and 97%, respectively, of the
drug is eliminated.
• elimination of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in
patients with severe sepsis was rapid and consistent
with the t1⁄2 in healthy individuals.[22]
• cl of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) increases with
increased bodyweight (section 5).[22] covariates,
including age, sex, estrogen status, disease severity
or heparin coadministration, or multiple covariates
did not alter cl of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) to a
clinically significant degree.
• the magnitude of difference in cl between patients with severe sepsis with and without renal or
hepatic dysfunction was within the interquartile
range of the observed weight-adjusted cl in all
drugs 2002; 62 (4)

 xxxd1948xxx  (activated): new drug profile

patients in the efficacy trial (section 5).[22] weightadjusted cl of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) was
23.7% lower in renally impaired patients on dialysis [cockroft-gault creatinine clearance (clcr)
of <1.2 l/h (20 ml/min)] with severe sepsis than in
patients with clcr >3.0 l/h (50 ml/min). patients
with baseline levels of ast or alt >3 times the
upper limit of normal had weight-adjusted cl of
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) that were 23.7 and
26.7% lower, respectively, than patients with normal baseline levels.
• the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) are not significantly influenced by baseline
plasma levels of endogenous  xxxg1847xxx  in
healthy individuals or patients with severe sepsis
(section 5).[22] similarly, baseline levels of coagulation markers [haematological sequential organ
failure assessment (sofa) scores, pt and whole
blood aptt] and il-6 do not clinically affect the
pharmacokinetic profile (section 5).
• preliminary pharmacokinetic data in paediatric
patients with severe sepsis treated with drotrecogin
alfa (activated) are consistent with those in adult
patients with severe sepsis.[22] in 43 paediatric patients (newborns to <18 years) treated with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/kg/h for 96 hours, css
was 66.6 mug/l, cl was 0.49 l/h/kg and t1⁄2 was
0.91h.
3. therapeutic trials
the efficacy of intravenous  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) in reducing the mortality rate of patients with severe sepsis has been evaluated in two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre studies.[20,22,35] based on the results of
the dose-ranging phase ii trial,[22,35] which showed
trends towards improvements in mortality in patients treated with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) [12
to 30 mug/kg/h for 48 or 96 hours], the large, adequately powered phase iii efficacy trial was initiated.[20,22]
adult patients with severe sepsis[1] were eligible for enrolment in the two trials.[20,22,35] severe
sepsis was defined as suspected or proven infection

sepsis-induced dysfunction of at least one organ or
system.[20,22]
patients were excluded from the studies if they
had a condition or had taken medication which increased the risk of bleeding (with the exception of
prophylactic heparin treatment <15 units/kg/h),
chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count <30 × 109/l), or a known
hypercoagulable condition or if death was perceived to be going to occur within 28 days because
of a pre-existing, non-sepsis related medical condition.[20,22] after patients met the inclusion criteria, treatment began within 24 hours in the phase
iii trial or 36 hours in the phase ii trial.[22]
a nonblind trial in paediatric patients with severe sepsis determined the recommended infusion
rate of the agent for these patients.[22] the efficacy
of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in paediatric patients may be extrapolated from the results of the
efficacy trial in adults. inclusion criteria were more
restrictive than those used in the adult studies and
were age-specific for sirs and organ failure. consistent with the higher incidence of meningitis in
children, the cns was the site of infection in
16.9% of the paediatric patients.[22]
dose-ranging trial

in the dose-ranging trial, 131 patients with severe sepsis were randomised to receive continuous
infusions of low-dose  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
[12 or 18 mug/kg/h; n = 51] or high-dose drotrecogin
alfa (activated) [24 or 30 mug/kg/h; n = 39] or placebo (n = 41) for 48 or 96 hours.[35] at enrolment,
all patients had d-dimer levels above the upper
limit of normal and 92% of the patients were protein c deficient.[35] the effect of  xxxd1948xxx

termine the effective infusion rate and infusion duration (section 1).
• the effective infusion rate and duration for use
of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in patients with severe sepsis was determined to be 24 mug/kg/h for 96
hours based on reductions in plasma d-dimer levels (section 1).[22,35] a large number of patients receiving  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 30 mug/kg/h required a decrease in infusion rate; therefore, this
infusion rate was not studied for longer than a 48hour infusion duration.
• patients with severe sepsis receiving high-dose
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) infusions exhibited a
trend in reduction in the incidence of mortality and
an improvement in the number of days free of
sirs, ventilator usage, shock, and stays in the intensive care unit and hospital.[35] the observed 28day mortality rate was 21% in the high drotrecogin
alfa (activated) dose group, 35% in the low-dose
group and 34% in the placebo group. compared
with the results in the placebo recipients, the 40%
relative risk reduction in 28 day all-cause mortality
in the high  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) dose group
and 15% reduction in all  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) groups were not statistically significant.[22,35]
efficacy trial

the second interim analysis of the randomised,
placebo-controlled, double-blind efficacy study revealed a significantly greater reduction in the 28day mortality rate of 768 patients treated with
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/kg/h for 96 hours
(25.0%) than in 752 patients receiving placebo
(31.4%; p = 0.0071); therefore, enrolment in the
trial was suspended because it had met the a priori
criteria for reduced mortality.[20,22]
death from any cause was the primary endpoint
of the trial and was assessed 28 days after the initiation of treatment.[20] analysis of data included
all patients who received the infusion for any
length of time and was founded on three baseline
covariates: disease severity, age (<60 or ≥60 years),
and plasma protein c activity level.[20,22] the acute

data from patients with severe sepsis who were
enrolled before second interim analysis was completed are included in the results for a total study
population of 1690.[20,22] similar baseline demographic and disease severity characteristics were
seen in the placebo (n = 840) and  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) 24 mug/kg/h for 96 hours (n = 850) treatment groups. for example, in the  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) and placebo groups, mean apache ii
scores were 24.6 and 25.0, respectively, the percentage of patients aged ≥60 years were 55.9 and
56.4%, respectively, and protein c was deficient in
83.4 and 79.8% of patients, respectively. in both
treatment groups, approximately 75% of patients
had two or more organ failures.
within 24 hours of the diagnosis of severe sepsis, 89.3% of patients in the  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) group and 89.1% of patients in the placebo
group received appropriate antibacterial therapy,
which was continued for at least 5 days or until
death.[53] the most frequent sites of infection were
the lungs (53.6% in each group) and abdomen
[19.9% in the placebo group, 20.0% in the  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) group]. likewise, within
each group and between the two groups, the incidence of gram-positive and gram-negative organism cultures was similar. at least 90% of the intended infusion was received by 81.8% of the
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) group and 82.4% of the
placebo group.[20]
• in patients with severe sepsis, a significantly
greater reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality was
seen in 850  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) recipients
(24.7%; n = 210) than in 840 placebo (30.8%; n =
259) recipients [absolute reduction in the risk of
death 6.1%; 95% confidence interval (ci), 1.9 to
10.4%; figure 3].[20] in comparison with placebo,
treatment with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) produced a 19.4% reduction in the relative risk of
death at 28 days (95% ci, 6.6 to 30.5%)[20] and a
27.6% reduction in the odds of death at 28 days
(p = 0.005).[22]

• this equates to a 38.1% increase in the odds of
28-day survival compared with the placebo group.[22]
in other words, for every 16 patients treated with
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) 24 mug/kg/h for 96
hours in the population studied, one death would
be prevented in the first 28 days.[20] to put this in
perspective, a widely accepted standard of effective clinical practice is the treatment of 56 patients
for intravenous thrombolysis in acute myocardial
infarction to prevent one death within 35
days.[58,59]
• analysis of >70 subgroups of patients stratified
according to baseline characteristics [e.g. demographics (including age), disease severity, type and
site of infection, and number of dysfunctional organs or systems] showed a consistent beneficial
effect of treatment with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) with similar p-values, relative risks and
odds ratios compared with the primary analysis.[20,22,53] in patients treated with drotrecogin

days in recipients of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
was similar in patients with or without prior or preexisting conditions (e.g. hypertension, myocardial
infarction, diabetes mellitus, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).[20,53] in comparison with
placebo, the overall relative reduction in the risk
of death by 28 days was 19.4% (p = 0.005) in patients with severe sepsis treated with drotrecogin

of days alive without the need for vasopressor support was seen in  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) recipients compared with placebo recipients (20.1 vs
18.8 days; p = 0.014).[22,60] likewise, drotrecogin
alfa (activated) decreased the number of mechanical ventilator-free days by a significantly greater
extent than placebo (14.3 vs 13.2 days; p = 0.049).
among survivors, the differences in total or organspecific sofa scores (mean and cumulative) were
not significant between treatment arms.[60]
• the differences in the number of sirs-, intensive care unit (icu)- or hospital-free days were not
statistically significant between the two treatment

at least one serious adverse event during the infusion period (6.8 and 6.5%, respectively) and during
the 28-day study period (12.5 and 12.1%, respectively) [figure 4].[20,22] except for bleeding adverse
events, there were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of
any adverse event of any degree of severity.[22,54]
• during the infusion period, the incidence of a
bleeding event reported as a serious adverse event
was more frequent in the  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) treatment group than in the placebo group
(2.4 vs 1.0%; p = 0.024).[20,22] the definition of a
serious bleeding event was any intracranial haemorrhage, any life-threatening bleeding, any bleeding event classified as serious by the investigator,
or any bleeding that required the administration of
three units of packed  xxxd187xxx  on 2 consecutive
days. gastrointestinal bleeding was the most frequently reported adverse bleeding event in both
groups.

• during the infusion and 28-day study periods,
the increased proportion of patients with at least

(activated) group was associated with procedurerelated events (e.g. instrumentation of a major
blood vessel or highly vascular organ).[22] there
were no significant differences between the treatment groups in serious bleeding events that were
not procedure-related. serious bleeding occurred
mainly in patients with an identifiable predisposition to bleeding [e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding,
aptt >120 seconds, prolonged pt (international
normalised ratio >3.0), or traumatic injury of a
blood vessel or of a highly vascular organ] in both
treatment groups.[20]

than placebo recipients (18.8 vs 10.8% and 24.9 vs
17.7%, respectively; p < 0.001 for both).[22] the
majority of these events were mild or moderate in
severity for both groups. the most commonly reported bleeding events were cutaneous and gastrointestinal tract bleeding.

degree of severity were reported in 68.6 and 81.8%
of patients treated with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)

of placebo recipients experienced at least one adverse event during the infusion and study period,
respectively.
• patients with severe sepsis receiving drotrecogin
alfa (activated) permanently discontinued treatment because of an adverse event by a significantly
greater extent (6.4%) than patients receiving placebo (3.6%) in the efficacy trial (p = 0.009).[22] the
most frequently reported adverse event that led to
permanent withdrawal of the infusion was gastrointestinal haemorrhage [1.3% of  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) recipients vs 0.6% of placebo recipients; p = 0.138].
• there was no apparent difference in treatment
effect on the relative risk or odds of treatmentemergent bleeding events of any severity across the
70 investigated subgroups of patients.[22] however, a robust assessment of serious bleeding risk
by subgroup is precluded by the small absolute increase in the number of patients (n = 13) who experienced a serious bleeding event.

placebo group, the death of a patient who developed cerebral infarcts was possibly related to placebo treatment.
• the risk of serious bleeding did not increase
with coadministration of a prophylactic dose of
heparin as evidenced by the similar incidence of
serious bleeding in patients who received  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) alone and those who also
received heparin during the 96-hour infusion period (2.4 vs 2.3%) and 28-day study period (3.7 vs
3.5%) of the efficacy trial.[20,22] therapeutic concentrations of other anticoagulants and fibrinolytic
agents were not allowed during the trial.[22]
• in the efficacy trial, administration of drotrecogin
alfa (activated) was not associated with an increase
in the incidence of thrombotic events, which occurred in 17 patients (2.0%) in the  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) group and 25 patients (3.0%) in the placebo group (figure 4).[20,22] the development of
antibodies against endogenous  xxxg1847xxx 
may be indicated by the occurrence of thrombotic
events.[22,61] likewise, immunogenicity testing did
not detect the presence of neutralising antibodies
against  xxxg1847xxx  in any patient.[20]
• the incidence of new infections did not increase
with the administration of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated).[20,22] 25.5 and 25.1% of the  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) and placebo recipients, respectively,
had new infections during the efficacy trial.

serum chemical data or haematological data in the
efficacy trial did not reveal any additional safety
concerns associated with administration of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated).[20]

including this event, four patients (4.8%) had a serious bleeding event including nasopharyngeal
haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage and petechial haemorrhage. the 14-day mortality rate was
9.6%; the other seven deaths reported were due to
sepsis-related complications.
• at least one treatment-emergent adverse event
was experienced by 94.0% of paediatric patients.[22]
fever (19.3%), generalised oedema (15.7%), agitation, lung oedema and thrombocytopenia (14.5%
for each) were the most frequent adverse events
reported.
5. dosage and administration
drotreogin alfa (activated) should be administered by continuous intravenous infusion at a rate
of 24mug/kg/h for a total infusion duration of 96
hours.[54] infusion rates should be adjusted for
bodyweight.[22,54] however, no adjustments are
required for age, gender, estrogen status, disease
severity, prophylactic heparin coadministration,
renal or hepatic dysfunction, baseline haematological sofa scores, or baseline plasma endogenous  xxxg1847xxx , pt, whole blood appt
or il-6 levels (section 2).[22] the drug is contraindicated in patients with clinical conditions in which
bleeding could be associated with significant morbidity or a high risk of death (e.g. active internal
bleeding, recent haemorrhagic stroke, recent intracranial or intraspinal surgery, recent severe head
trauma, trauma with an increased risk of life-threatening bleeding, presence of an epidural catheter,
intracranial neoplasm or mass lesion, or evidence
of cerebral herniation).
