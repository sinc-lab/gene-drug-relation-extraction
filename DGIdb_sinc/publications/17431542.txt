abstract seizures are a common complication of
metastatic brain tumors (mbt), affecting approximately
27–50% of all patients during the course of their illness.
treatment of tumor-induced seizures is often inadequate
with traditional antiepileptic drugs (aed) due to a variety
of factors, including activation of glutamatergic nmda
receptors, alterations of neuronal input pathways, and
tumor growth.  xxxd2466xxx  (lev) is a 2nd generation
non-enzyme inducing aed with a novel mechanism of
action, binding to neuronal synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2233xxx ,
that has been previously shown to reduce seizure activity in
patients with primary brain tumors. due to its unique
mechanism of action, it has been postulated that lev may
also be effective in controlling seizures from mbt. a
retrospective chart review was performed of all neurooncology center patients with mbt who had received
lev for seizure control. thirteen patients were reviewed
with a median age of 55.1 years (range: 34–70). six
patients had breast cancer, five had lung cancer, and two
had melanoma. lev was used as an add-on aed in seven
patients (54%) and as monotherapy in six patients (46%),
with a median dose of 1,000 mg/day (range: 500–3,000).

the baseline median seizure frequency was one ictal event
every other day. after the addition of lev, the median
seizure frequency was reduced to 0 per week. the seizure
frequency was reduced to less than 50% of the pre-lev
baseline in 100% of patients (p = 0.0002, sign test), with
10 patients (77%; confidence interval: 46–95%) noting
complete seizure control. the most common adverse event
was somnolence and headache, noted in 3 of 13 patients
(23%). lev was very effective and well tolerated in mbt
patients with seizures and should be considered for add-on
therapy or as a substitute aed for monotherapy.

introduction
metastatic brain tumors (mbt) are the most frequent
neurologic complication seen in patients with systemic
cancer, occurring in 10–40% of patients [1–2]. the
systemic cancers most likely to metastasize to the brain
include lung, breast, and melanoma, although there are
known cases of brain metastases from cancers originating
in the colon, rectum, kidney, prostate, testis, and ovary [3].
seizures occur in 27–50% of patients with mbt during the
course of their illness [4, 5]. primaries with the highest
frequencies of seizure activity include melanoma (67%),
lung (29%), and gastrointestinal (21%) [4]. although there
is little evidence that patients with mbt should be treated
prophylactically with anti-epileptic drugs (aeds), patients
who do develop seizure activity should be placed on an
effective aed [6].
treatment of tumor-induced seizures is often inadequate
with conventional aeds. this inadequacy is due to a

123

294

variety of factors, such as activation of glutamatergic
nmda receptors, alterations of neuronal input pathways,
and tumor growth. additionally, the mechanism of action
of traditional aeds may not be effective in treating tumorinduced seizures. traditional aeds act through excitatory
mechanisms via blockade or inactivation of na+ channels
(phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate) and/or ca2+ channels (lamotrigine, topiramate,  xxxd2809xxx ), or through
inhibitory mechanisms via stimulation of gabaergic
activity (benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, tiagabine,
vigabatrin, gabapentin). these mechanisms of action only
cover a few of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of tumorinduced seizures known to exist [5]. the majority of
traditional aeds (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital,  xxxd2809xxx ) induce the hepatic cytochrome p450
system, which may lead to increased metabolism of corticosteroids and many chemotherapeutic agents that are also
metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome p450 system
(nitrosurea, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, irinotecan,
adriamycin, methotrexate) [7–9]. this can lead to inadequate corticosteroid and chemotherapeutic dosing in
patients with mbt, which is of significant concern.
 xxxd2466xxx  (lev) is a 2nd generation non-cytochrome p450 inducing aed with a novel mechanism of
action [7, 10, 11]. lev binds with high-affinity to the
synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2233xxx , which is enriched in synaptic vesicles and is believed to be involved in synaptic
vesicle exocytosis and presynaptic neurotransmitter release
[12, 13]. in an audiogenic mouse model of epilepsy, there
is a strong correlation between the affinity of a compound
for  xxxg2233xxx  and its anti-epileptic effect [13]. lev also
induces a reduction of ca2+ current through neuron-specific, high voltage activated n-type ca2+ channels [14, 15].
additionally, lev reduces the effect of zn2+ and the betacarbolines on gaba and glycine, the main inhibitory
receptors of the central nervous system [16]. multiple
studies have shown that lev exerts neuroprotective effects
via stimulation of neurotrophic factors that reduce the
amount of inflammation and neuronal death that occurs
with seizures [17, 18].
due to the unique mechanism of action of lev, its lack
of significant drug–drug interactions, and its lack of
interaction with the hepatic cytochrome p450 system, it has
been suggested as the best choice of aed in patients with
brain tumors [7, 19]. many studies have shown that lev as
add-on or monotherapy reduces the seizure activity in
patients with primary brain tumors [19–21]. some of these
studies have included patients with mbt, but none of them
have isolated these patients and their results of epilepsy
treatment with lev. to test the effectiveness of lev in
the treatment of tumor-induced epilepsy in patients with
mbt, we have performed a retrospective analysis of the
efficacy and tolerability of lev in a cohort of patients that

123

have received the drug while being followed at the
dardinger neuro-oncology center.

materials and methods
a retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients
with mbts that had received lev for seizure control at the
dardinger neuro-oncology center. criteria for eligibility
in the study included the diagnosis of mbt, placement on
lev, and at least one follow-up visit after beginning
treatment with lev. indications to initiate lev therapy
included: seizure activity that persisted after maximal
therapy with traditional aeds, potential drug interactions
with chemotherapeutic agents or corticosteroids, and
unacceptable adverse side effects of other aeds. patients
with concomitant epileptic conditions were excluded. data
regarding seizure frequency was obtained from patient
histories, hospital charts, and clinic notes. for each patient,
seizure frequency data was collected for a minimum
interval of 4 weeks after the initiation of lev, with additional data being collected at each scheduled follow-up
visit after the initial 4 week visit. significant improvement
in seizure frequency was defined as a greater than 50%
reduction in seizure activity as compared to the pre-lev
baseline. additional data collected about each patient
included age, gender, primary tumor site, and treatment
modalities.

results
a total of 13 patients were reviewed with a median age of
55.1 years (range: 34–70). of the total cohort, six patients
had breast cancer, five had lung cancer, and two had
melanoma. eleven of the 13 patients (85%) suffered from
partial seizures, while 2/13 (15%) suffered from generalized seizures. the majority of patients had already received
some form of irradiation (whole-brain radiation, gamma
knife) and many had received or were currently receiving
chemotherapy (e.g. tamoxifen, paclitaxel, herceptin). most
of the patients remained clinically and radiologically stable
during the study, without significant change in tumor size
by mri imaging. each patient had their post-lev seizure
frequency evaluated after 1 month of treatment with lev,
and at each subsequent scheduled visit. the mean length of
time each patient’s seizure frequency was followed after
the initiation of lev was 15 months (range: 1 month–
4 years). for patients in which lev was used as add-on
therapy for inadequate seizure control by other aeds, the
initial aed (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate,
 xxxd2809xxx ) had already been titrated to adequate

j neurooncol (2007) 84:293–296

295

therapeutic levels. lev was used as an add-on aed in
seven patients (54%) and as monotherapy in six patients
(46%), with a median dose of 1,000 mg/day (range:
500–3,000). the interval of evaluation of seizure frequency
during lev treatment was 4 weeks for all patients. prior to
initiating lev therapy, the median seizure frequency was
one ictal event every other day (range: 2 every day–1 every
month). after the initiation of lev, the median seizure
frequency was reduced to 0 per week (range: 0–2 every
month). all patients (100%) had their seizure frequency
reduced to less than 50% of their pre-lev baseline
(p = 0.0002, sign test), with 10 patients (77%) noting
complete seizure control (confidence interval: 46–95%). if
analyzed by primary tumor site of origin, complete seizure
control was noted in 5/6 (83%) patients with breast cancer,
3/5 (60%) patients with lung cancer, and 2/2 (100%)
patients with melanoma. there were no correlations noted
between the use of irradiation or chemotherapy and clinical
response to lev.
a total of 6/13 (46%) patients experienced adverse side
effects from lev. the most common side effects were
somnolence and headache, each experienced by 3/13 (23%)
patients. blurry vision was experienced by 2/13 (15%)
patients and 1/13 (8%) patients experienced nausea and
vomiting while on lev. the clinical response to lev did
not appear to correlate with dosage or the presence of side
effects (table 1).

discussion
the incidence of seizures in patients with mbt ranges
from 27 to 50% [4, 5]. the overall incidence of seizure
activity appears to be highest in patients with melanoma as
the primary tumor (67%), followed by lung as the primary
(29%), and gastrointestinal as the primary (21%) [4].

are in need of further treatment with an add-on aed. lev
as an add-on aed has been shown to be efficacious in
many patients with primary brain tumors and seizures
[19–21]. the results of this study suggest that lev is a
good choice for an add-on aed in patients with mbt,
because 54% of our cohort received lev for this reason
and all patients showed benefit. there was significant
improvement in seizure frequency in 100% of patients after
the initiation of lev, with 71% noting complete seizure
control. lev also seemed to be effective when used as
monotherapy, which occurred in 46% of our cohort. lev
as monotherapy caused significant improvement in seizure
frequency in 100% of patients, with 83% noting complete
seizure control. recent studies in adult patients with various forms of partial and generalized epilepsy suggest that
lev is active and well tolerated when used as monotherapy [22–24]. one study even showed that lev as first-line
monotherapy was as effective as carbamazepine in treating
newly diagnosed epilepsy [24]. the american academy of
neurology has concluded that there is insufficient evidence
at this time to recommend the use of lev as monotherapy
for newly diagnosed epilepsy patients or in those with
refractory partial seizures [25–27]. further clinical trials
with lev (i.e. prospective randomized placebo controlled)
are needed before the aan will recommend lev as
first-line monotherapy for the treatment of epilepsy.
the results of this study confirm that lev is well tolerated and can improve seizure control in patients with
mbt. however, due to the relatively small size of our
cohort and the limitations of retrospective analyses from
confounding variables, including tumor status, treatment
status, and clinical status at the start of lev treatment, our
data is not able to serve as an official endorsement of
efficacy in this patient population.
tumor-induced seizures need to be considered separately from traditional epilepsy when selecting appropriate
aed therapy. the severity of aed side effects in patients
with brain tumors appears to be 20–40% higher than in the
general population requiring aeds, largely due to the
presence of drug-drug interactions [3]. the most commonly cited aed side effects noted in patients with brain
tumors are myelosuppression, thrombocytopenia, rash,
changes in behavior or cognition, ataxia, and elevated liver
enzymes [28]. these side effects are even more worrisome
in patients who are immunocompromised secondary to
chemotherapy or radiation therapy. the side effects experienced by patients with brain tumors and mbts taking
lev seem to be milder than with traditional aeds. less
than 50% of patients in this study experienced adverse
effects while on lev, and the adverse effects that were
experienced were mild, including somnolence, headache,
blurry vision, nausea, and vomiting. another study also
noted mild side effects from lev, including somnolence,

123

296

headache, dizziness, and paresthesia [20]. many traditional aeds (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital,
 xxxd2809xxx ), corticosteroids, and chemotherapeutic
agents commonly given to patients with brain tumors
(nitrosurea, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, irinotecan,
adriamycin, methotrexate) are known to induce the hepatic
cytochrome p450 system [7–9]. these interactions can
cause inadequate serum levels of aeds, corticosteroids,
and chemotherapeutic agents in patients with brain tumors,
resulting in inadequate seizure control and inadequate
treatment of the malignancy. valproate is a known inhibitor of the hepatic cytochrome p450 system, and can cause
increased and sometimes toxic serum levels of chemotherapeutic agents [29, 30]. in contrast, lev does not
interact with the hepatic cytochrome p450 system, so there
is less opportunity for negative drug-drug interactions,
making it a better choice of aed in many patients with
brain tumors and seizure activity [7, 11, 19].
in conclusion, this retrospective cohort study has demonstrated that lev was both effective and well tolerated in
patients with mbt and persistent seizure activity. based on
its unique mechanism of action, relative lack of drug–drug
interactions, and mild side effect profile, lev is a good
choice for add-on aed treatment for patients with mbt.
lev may also be effective as monotherapy in selective
patients.
