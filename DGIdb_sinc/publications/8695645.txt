abstract
two peaks of aspartate an-tinotransferase (aspat) catalytic activity were observed during deae chromatography of a protein extract
from alkalophilic b. circulans. the enzyme purified from the major peak appeared to be not aspartate but  xxxg1856xxx 
(psat) with a considerably high aspat side activity. the sequence of the enzyme n-terminus was determined, and the psat gene was
cloned as two separate fragments. dna sequencing revealed the open reading frame for the psat starting from ttg, putative ribosomal
binding site and terminator of transcription. the psat gene encodes a protein of 361 amino acids (m r 39 793) which shows moderate
homology to other known  xxxd1857xxx  aminotransferases (36-46% of identity, 60-64% of similarity). the psat from the alkalophile
shares with all of them the consensus sequence pattern around the pyridoxal y-phosphate attachment site.

1. introduction
alkalophilic microbes attract a considerable interest
because of their high ph optima of growth and resistance
to alkaline conditions [1-3]. the alkaline environment
should stimulate the accumulation of certain features in
proteins making them stable and active at high ph. comparison of structures among similar enzymes with different
ph optima and stability may clarify the nature of these
features and thus provide valuable information for protein
engineering. convenient objects for such investigation can
be transaminases, the big group of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
(plp)-dependent enzymes which have been isolated from
various sources but not from alkalopilic microorganisms.
the alkalophilic strain bacillus circulans atcc 21783
which is able to grow in media with ph up to 11 [3] was

the source for the isolation of enzymes with transaminase
activities using a colorimetric method developed for aspartate aminotransferase (aspat). based on a high aspat
side activity, a  xxxg1856xxx  (psat, ec
2.6.1.52) was discovered that substantially contributes to
the total aspat activity in the cells of the alkalophile.
here we report the purification of the enzyme and cloning
of its gene.

2. materials and methods

2.1. bacterial strains
bacillus circulans subsp, alkalophilus (atcc 21783)
was used for isolation of psat and chromosomal d n a
for the cloning of the psat gene. cells were grown in
media, containing 0.2% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract,
0.13% k 2 h p o 4 • 3h20, 0.02% m g s o 4 . 7 h 2 0 , 0.3% laspartate, 1% potato starch and 1% na2co 3. e. coli
xll-blue [reca1, enda1, gyra96, thi-1, hsdr17, supe44,
rela1, lac, [ f' proab, lacl q zam15, tnlo(tetr)] (stratagene) was used as the host in the cloning and was grown
in luria-bertani medium [4]. when necessary, ampicillin
was added to the medium (50 ixg/ml).

2.2. isolation of psat

cells were suspended in the same buffer containing 2 mm
edta, 0.01% 2- xxxd26xxx , 20 ixm plp and 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. they were disrupted by
sonication and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 20000 rpm for 30 min. soluble proteins were
fractionated by ammonium sulfate. the 40-80% fraction
containing 84% of aspat active material was dissolved in

the bacterial cells were grown in a 10 1 fermentor and
were harvested in the late logarithmic phase, when ph of
the growth medium attained 8.5-8.7. after washing with
20 mm khpo4-buffer (ph 7.2), cells were stored frozen
until a total mass of 240 g (wet weight) was obtained.

tate, 1 p~mol of ot-ketoglutarate and 10 p~m plp in 0.1 m
sodium borate buffer (ph 9.0). incubation was carried out
for 30 rain at 37°c. saturated dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2
m hc1 (0.5 ml) was added, the mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 20 min, and 5 ml of 0.4 m naoh
were added. after 10 min the absorption was measured at
510 nm. one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme
that catalyses the formation of 1 ixmol pyruvate/min
under the above conditions. psat activity was determined
by coupling the enzyme reaction with glutamate dehydrogenase as described by hirsch and greenberg [6] with a
slight modification. the assay mixture contained the enzyme sample, 1.25 lzmol phosphohydroxypyruvate, 20
ixmol l-glutamate, 80 ixmol ammonium acetate, 50 ixmol
plp, 0.5 izmol nadh and 0.2 mg glutamate dehydrogenase (boehringer mannheim) in 50 mm tris-hc1 (ph
8.0) in a total volume of 2.5 ml. the decrease in nadh
absorption at 340 nm was measured at 37°c.
2.5. general dna techniques
dna manipulations and transformation of e. coli were
accomplished according to sambrock et al. [4]. dna

2.3. n-terminal sequence analysis

aspat side activity of the enzyme was monitored during the purification
as described in section 2

the final preparation of the protein was loaded on
8-25% sds-page (phastgel, pharmacia). the major band
was plated on a prospin filter, and the n-terminal aminoacid sequence was determined by running 26 cycles of
edman degradation in a model 477a protein sequencer
equipped with an on-line model 120a pth amino acid
analyzer (applied biosystems).
2.4. activity measurement
the aspat activity was assayed by the colorimetric
assay [5] with a slight modification. the assay mixture (1

fig. 3. nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences of the alkalophilic b. circulans psat gene and its flanking regions. the putative ribosomal-binding
site and terminator-like inverted repeat sequence are underlined. the underlined amino acids were determined by sequencing the n-terminus of the purified
psat. oligonucleotides ai and a2 used in hybridization and pcr experiments are shown by dashed lines.

fragments from agarose gels were blotted onto a hybond-n
membrane (amersham) as recommended by the manufacturer. dna taq-polymerase (hytest, finland) was used for
pcr experiments. nucleodde sequencing was carded out
by the method of sanger et al. [7] using sequenase 2.0
(usb) in the conditions recommended for this enzyme by
the manufacturer.

2.6. computer analysis of sequence data
the uwgcg sequence analysis software package, version 7.0 [8] was used for sequence comparison of protein
pairs (bes~t program). multalinprogram, version 2.1 [9]
was used for multiple seqnence alignment.

3. results and discussion

3. i. purification of psat
microbial transaminases are not strictly substrate specific, therefore a simple cclorimetric method developed for
aspat [5] was used for monitoring of the transaminase
activities. after sonication of b. circulans cells proteins
from the crude extract were precipitated by ammonium
sulfate and subjected to anion exchange chromatography.
the first deae-sepharose column resulted in a broad

peak of aspat activity which resolved into two separate
active peaks after the second deae-sepharose column
(fig. 1a). the active protein from the major peak which
was eluted first was further purified by ion exchange (fig.
l b), hydrophobic interaction (fig. 1c) and size-exclusion
(fig. id) chromatography (table 1) until the preparation
was practically homogeneous by sds-page. all steps
following the deae-sepharose chromatography showed a
single aspat activity in this peak (fig. 1b-d). the
enzyme showed m r of about 70000 in size-exclusion
chromatograpy and of about 37 000 in sds-page (data
not shown). it seems therefore to be a homodimer, following the general pattern of plp-dependent enzymes [10].
the n-terminal sequence of the purified protein was
determined as skxaynfnagpaalpxevl (x represents unidentified amino acid). the search of homologous
sequences through genbank produced the highest scores
for psats of microbial origin. this prompted us to compare psat and aspat activities of the final protein
preparation in specific assays. the isolated protein was
identified as psat, since it showed about 10-times higher
activity in the psat than in the aspat assay (33.6 p~mol
min- j mg i and 4 ixmol min- 1 mg- 1, respectively).
why the contribution of psat to the total aspat
activity is so high in alkalophilic b. circulans remains an
open question. this enzyme catalyzes a glutamate-linked
transamination of d- xxxd35xxx  to l-phospho-

serine, the second step in the phosphorylated pathway of
l-serine biosynthesis [1 1]. l-serine is an important amino
acid for the cell, because it serves as a major intracellular
source of one-carbon unit in metabolism. however, little is
known about a regulation of any gene in serine biosynthesis. moreover, alkaline growth conditions may modify
the metabolic pathway pattern of a microorganism somehow inducing psat synthesis.
3.2. cloning o f the psat gene

considering amino acids 4 to 13, a 29-mer oligonucleotide (ai) 5'-gcita(c/t)aa(c/t)tt(c/t)aa(c/t)gciggiccigcigc-3' (i, inosine) was synthesized and
used as probe for hybridization. chromosomal dna from
the alkalophilic b. circulans was digested to completion
with ecori, bamhi, kpni, bglii, psti, hindiii, sali
and sphi. some double digestions were also made. dna
restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto hybond-n membrane. the
a1 oligonucleotide was labelled with [-/- 32p]atp, and
southern hybridization was carried out overnight at 50°c.
for all digestions only one band was visible after x-ray
exposure. the psat gene restriction map constructed on
the basis of the hybridization results is shown in fig. 2.
according to the restriction map, the fragments bgllihindlii (3.7 kb), kpni-bamhi (6.3 kb) and hindliihindlii (4.4 kb) were sufficiently long to contain the full
gene independently on its orientation. they were ligated to
corresponding sites of puc 18 or puc 19, and the mixtures
were used for transformation of competent e. coli cells.
ampicillin-resistant colonies were transferred onto hybond-n filters, fixed and hybridized with the radioactive
a1 oligonucleotide. none of these experiments resulted in
a positive clone.
to facilitate gene cloning pcr was used for amplification of the region coding for psat. the ligation mixture
of bglli-hindlii fragments and a vector provided the
necessary template for pcr, where the vector-specific
primer served as pair to the a1 oligonucleotide. the

puc18/bamhi-hindlii was used as template in pcr

experiments carried out in the presence of (1) a1 oligonucleotide plus m13 universal sequence primer, and (2)
a1 oligonucleotide plus mi3 reverse sequence primer.
only reaction (1) resulted in a pcr product (1.7 kb). it
allowed to locate the start of psat open reading frame
and estimate its direction. restriction analysis of the pcr
product confirmed the positions of the ecori, psti and
sphi sites, detected by southern hybridization, and showed
the presence of the additional psti site in the middle of the
sphi-hindlii fragment (fig. 2).
the pcr fragment was trimmed with t4-dna polymerase, and an annealed self-complementary bamhi
adapter (5'-cgggatcccg-3') was ligated to its ends.
the fragment digested with bamhi and hindlii was
ligated to corresponding sites of puc18, and the mixture
was used for e. coli transformation. plasmids from 4
colonies were isolated and sequenced using the m13 reverse-sequence primer. inserts were identical except differences in the positions corresponding to inosine and bias
( t / c ) bases in a1 oligonucleotide. the comparison of
sequence data with the rest of the known n-terminal
amino-acid sequence showed that the pcr product indeed
represented the gene of interest. the insert from one of the
4 plasmids was sequenced entirely.
to ensure that the pcr fragment did not contain mistakes caused by the taq polymerase the chromosomal
ecori-hindlii fragment was cloned. the bglli-hindlii
fragment was digested with ecori and ligated into corresponding sites of puc18. after transformation ampicillin
resistant colonies were transferred onto hybond-n membrane, fixed and hybridized with 3j-32p-labelled oligonucleotide (a2) 5'-ggtgtctggaaacgccttgaa-3'
synthesized on the basis of the pcr fragment sequence
data. many positive colonies were obtained. one of them
was chosen for plasmid isolation and sequencing of the
whole insert. the dna sequences of chromosomal and
pcr-originated ecori-hindlli fragments were identical.
to clone the 5'-region and the beginning of the psat
structural gene bglli-hindlii fragment was digested with
sphi and psti, followed by ligation to the corresponding

sites of puc18. colonies obtained after transformation of
e. coli were transferred onto hybond-n membrane, fixed
and hybridized with 32p-labelled a 1 oligonucleotide. three
positive colonies of about 2000 were obtained. plasmids
isolated from them had higher molecular weight than
expected. their restriction analysis showed different patterns after ecori, psti and sphi digestion; the only
common band was an ecori-ecori fragment of about 0.7
kb, which correlated well with the southern hybridization
data. these fragments from all 3 plasmids were isolated
from the agarose gel and separately ligated into dephosphorylated p u c 1 8 / e c o r i . after transformation of e. coli
and isolation of plasmids containing inserts, ecori-ecori
fragments of the 3 initial clones were sequenced. no
differences were found among them. the data obtained
allowed to establish the nucleotide sequence of the p s a t
gene with its flanking regions and to deduce the p s a t
amino-acid sequence (fig. 3).

using the best~t program from the u w g c g software
package. the comparison showed a moderate homology of
the p s a t from b. circulans with other representatives of
the same family ( 3 6 - 4 6 % of identity and 6 0 - 6 4 % of
similarity; table 2). the homology of the b. circulans
p s a t with aspats from different sources is considerably
lower (about 20% of identity and 4 0 - 4 5 % of similarity;
data not shown). the alignment of p s a t amino-acid
sequences made by multalin program (fig. 4) revealed
two regions highly conserved in this group. one of them is
located around the lys-196 residue and represents the
consensus sequence pattern around the plp attachment site
[21] specific for this class of transaminases ( xxxd1857xxx 
aminotransferase signature [22]). thus, in b. circulans
p s a t lys-196 ought to be the residue which forms the
aldimine bond with plp providing the catalytical activity
of the transaminase. the function of the highly homologous regions in the c-terminus (amino acids 3 2 4 - 3 4 0 ) is
unknown.

3.3. nucleotide sequence analysis
three orf were found in the sequenced area, all in the
same orientation (figs. 2 and 3). the orf2 coding the
p s a t consists of 1083 bp and codes a protein of 361
amino acids ( m r 39793), what correlates well with the
data obtained from sds-page, the start codon is ttg
(position 539) which is found rather frequently (17%) in
m r n a s derived from gram-positive bacteria [12]. a putative ribosome-binding site, a g a a g g g t g g a g a , is 5 bp
upstream of the ttg methionine start codon. this sequence can be bound to the 3'-end of 16s rrna from b.
subtilis with free energy of - 5 7 . 7 8 k j / m o l [13]. the
p s a t gene stop codon t a a is followed by a hairpin
structure and a region encoding a stretch of 7 u residues.
the inverted repeat contains 5 g-c and 2 a - u pairs (fig.
3). hence, this structure probably acts as a rho-independent transcription termination signal of the p s a t gene.
the g + c content of the p s a t gene was 54.5%, which is
about 6% higher than the total genomic g + c content
(48.8%) of this alkalophile [3].
two partial orfs were found near the p s a t gene
(figs. 2 and 3). the orf1 is started beyond the sequenced
area and encodes a polypeptide of 116 amino acids, homologous to the c-terminus of glutamate synthetases from
various sources (40% identity with glutamate synthetase
from b. subtilis and about 50% identity with those from
e. coli, s. typhimurium and other bacteria). the orf3
starting from a t g at position 1753 codes a polypeptide of
143 amino acids and is interrupted by hindlii site. the
polypeptide is homologous (57% of identity) to a hypothetical 18.1 kda protein, situated near the glycerol dehydrogenase gene of b. stearothermophilus (orf3, [14]).
3.4. protein sequence analysis
the b. circulans p s a t was compared to five  xxxd1857xxx  aminotransferases from different sources [15-20]
