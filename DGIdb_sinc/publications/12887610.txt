differential effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors on  xxxd2973xxx  (paf)- and  xxxd80xxx  (adp)-induced equine platelet a...  compounds that activate adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp), inhibit equine platelet aggregation.  xxxd1773xxx  is broken down by phosphodiesterase (pde) and, in the present study, the effects of theophylline, a nonselective pde inhibitor, and selective inhibitors of pde isoenzymes  xxxg1695xxx , pde4 and pde5, on equine platelet aggregation in response to  xxxd2973xxx  (paf) and  xxxd80xxx  (adp) have been examined. theophylline and the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors, trequinsin and quazinone, inhibited both paf and adp-induced aggregation in a concentration dependent manner. the inhibition of paf-induced aggregation was, however, significantly greater than that of the response to adp. the inhibitory effects of theophylline and the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors on adp- but not paf-, induced aggregation were reversed by addition of the calcium ionophore, a23187.  xxxd3142xxx  and zaprinast, inhibitors of pde4 and pde5, respectively, had no effect on either paf- or adp-induced aggregation. these results demonstrate that inhibition of aggregation caused by paf or adp can be achieved by selective inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  but suggest that there may be agonist-specific differences in the intracellular signalling pathways that regulate equine platelet aggregation.
