abstract
fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) broadly used in the treatment of human mood disorders and gastrointestinal
diseases involving the serotoninergic system. the effectiveness of this therapy depends on repeated long-term treatment. most of the long-term
studies in vivo of ssri effects on serotoninergic activity have focused on their effects on autoreceptors or postsynaptic receptors. the chronic
effect of ssris on the activity of the serotonin transporter (sert) has been less studied and the results have been contradictory. the aim of this
study was to determine the specific effect of long-term fluoxetine treatment on human serotonin transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) in vitro, by using the human
enterocyte-like cell line caco-2. results show that fluoxetine diminished the 5-ht uptake in a concentration-dependent way and that this effect
was reversible. fluoxetine affected mainly the  xxxg2150xxx  transport rate by reducing the availability of the transporter in the membrane with no
significant alteration of either the total  xxxg2150xxx  protein content or the  xxxg2150xxx  mrna level. these results suggest that the effect of fluoxetine on the
expression of  xxxg2150xxx  is post-translational and has shown itself to be independent of pkc and pka activity. this study may be useful to clarify the
effect of the long-term fluoxetine therapy in both gastrointestinal and central nervous system disorders.

introduction
serotonin (5-ht) is a neurotransmitter whose activity is
mediated by specific 5-ht receptors and their downstream
signalling components. 5-ht has been described to be involved
in the origin of different pathologies in the central nervous
system (mann, 2003) and in the gastrointestinal tract (linden
et al., 2003). the transmitter can be regulated by removal from
the extracellular compartment by the serotonin transporter
(sert), which is the target of pharmacological molecules for
the treatment of mood disorders (blier and szabo, 2005) and
gastrointestinal diseases (baker, 2005). many groups have tried
to determine the acute effect of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (ssris) on sert. for example, ramamoorthy and
blakely (1999) demonstrated that paroxetine and citalopram

affect the level of sert phosphorylation mediated by protein
kinase c.
fluoxetine is one of the molecules most broadly used as a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) to treat psychiatric
disorders and some chronic intestinal pathologies, and the
maximal therapeutic effects of fluoxetine are obtained only after
long-term repeated treatment. the chronic effect of the ssris on
serotoninergic activity has also been studied; however most of
the long-term studies on ssris have focused on their effects on
autoreceptors or postsynaptic receptors and the responses they
elicit (blier and bouchard, 1994; auerbach and hjorth, 1995;
ceglia et al., 2004). in contrast, the effect of long-term ssris
treatment on sert function has been studied less (martel et al.,
2004; piñeyro et al., 1994; schloss and henn, 2004).
the results of in vivo studies of the ssris long-term effect
on sert are controversial. thus, numerous in vivo studies on
the antidepressant treatment effect on either ligand binding to
sert or its mrna content, have yielded contradictory
conclusions, with some studies reporting increases (hrdina
and vu, 1993; lopez et al., 1994), and others reporting decreases (lesch et al., 1993; watanabe et al., 1993; kuroda et al.,

1994; piñeyro et al., 1994; neumaier et al., 1996) or no change
(cheetham et al., 1993; burnet et al., 1994; spurlock et al.,
1994; gobbi et al., 1997) in these parameters. the use of an in
vitro cellular model in which the composition of the
extracellular culture medium is known and controlled might
be very useful in order to clarify these effects and to gain an indepth knowledge of the specific effect on sert of chronic
treatment with ssris.
previous results obtained in our laboratory have shown that
the human enterocyte-like caco-2 cell line expresses the human
sert ( xxxg2150xxx ), and is a good model for studying the function
and regulation of  xxxg2150xxx  (alcalde and sorribas, 2001; iceta
et al., 2006). consequently, the aim of this study was to determine the specific long-term effect of fluoxetine treatment on the
 xxxg2150xxx  function and expression in caco-2 cells. the results
obtained show that treatment with fluoxetine reduces hsertmediated 5-ht uptake in a concentration-dependent way. this
effect was reversible and was mainly due to a reduction in the
availability of the transporter in the membrane without altering
either the level of  xxxg2150xxx  mrna or the total amount of  xxxg2150xxx 
protein. consequently, treatment with fluoxetine seems to affect
post-translational processes, involving intracellular mechanisms. however, pkc and pka did not seem to be involved.

transport medium composition in mm was as follows: 137
nacl, 4.7 kcl, 1.2 kh2po4, 1.2 mgso2, 2.5 cacl2, 10 hepes
ph 7.4, 4 glutamine, 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  and both 5ht and 3[h]-5-ht (specific activity 20 ci/mmol, amersham
biosciences, ge healthcare, buckinghamshire, uk). before
measuring uptake, cells were pre-incubated at 37 °c in an
atmosphere of 5% co2 with substrate-free transport medium
(without 5-ht or modifiers) for 30 min. the cells were then
immediately washed twice with substrate-free transport medium
at 37 °c, and then incubated with transport medium at 37 °c for
6 min. transport was stopped by removing the transport medium and washing the cells twice with ice-cold substrate-free
transport medium containing 1 mm 5-ht. cells were then
solubilised in 0.1 m naoh and samples were taken for radioactivity counting. protein was measured using the bradford
method (bio-rad), with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
transport results were expressed in pmol 5-ht/mg protein.
rna extraction, reverse transcription and semiquantitative
pcr analysis

caco-2/tc7 cells (chantret et al., 1994) were kindly
provided by dr. edith brot-laroche (u-505 inserm). the
cells were cultured at 37 °c in an atmosphere of 5% co2 and
maintained in high glucose dmem supplemented with 50 u/ml
penicillin, 50 mug/ml streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino
acids and 20% foetal bovine serum (invitrogen, usa). the cells
were passaged enzymatically (0.25% trypsin–1 mm edta)
and sub-cultured in 25 or 75 cm2 plastic culture flasks (sarstedt,
germany). the medium was changed 48 h after seeding and
daily thereafter. the cells were always used between passage 19
and 35. for 5-ht uptake assays, cells were seeded in 24-well
plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well, and most uptake measurements were carried out 14 days after seeding (10 days after
confluence). previous results (iceta et al., 2006) have shown
that caco-2 cells express  xxxg2150xxx , whose activity reaches a
plateau the fifth day after confluence. fluoxetine and the
different modifiers were added to the culture medium at different concentrations and for different periods, depending on the
experiment. in the experiments, 6 h before the cells were used,
the cell medium was free of foetal bovine serum and modifiers.
this condition did not affect either the functional differentiation
status or the  xxxg2150xxx  activity of caco-2 cells (data not shown).

rna extractions were carried out with the rneasy mini kit
(qiagen, hilden, germany) following manufacturer's
instructions. total rna was extracted from caco-2 cells cultured in 25 cm2 flasks 14 days after seeding. the extracted rna
(1 mug) was used as a template for first-strand cdna synthesis
using oligo(dt) primers and a modified m-mlv reverse
transcriptase (invitrogen, usa). negative amplification control was performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase. one
tenth of the resultant cdna was used for  xxxg2150xxx  pcr amplification with human  xxxg53xxx  as an internal control. the specific
primers used were (5′–3′):  xxxg2150xxx  sense aaatccaagcacccagagat and  xxxg2150xxx  antisense agactgtgtccctgtggaga;  xxxg53xxx  sense agcacggcatcgtcaccaact and
 xxxg53xxx  antisense acatggctggggtgttgaagg. twentyseven cycles were carried out for  xxxg2150xxx  pcr amplification as
follows: 94 °c for 30 s, 56 °c for 30 s and 68 °c for 2 min 30 s.
pcr amplification of  xxxg53xxx  was obtained after twenty-five
cycles under the following conditions: 94 °c for 30 s, 60 °c for
30 s and 68 °c for 30 s. these final  xxxg2150xxx  and  xxxg53xxx  pcr
conditions were determined after screening (twenty to thirty
cycles). final pcr amplification conditions were chosen so that
none of the rnas (cdnas) analysed reached a plateau at the end
of the amplification protocol. pcr products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and visualized under uv light after
ethidium bromide staining. the images from the gels were
captured with biodoc-it imaging system (uvp inc, upland, ca,
usa). the fragment sizes were 2105 for  xxxg2150xxx  and 193 for betaactin. the  xxxg2150xxx / xxxg53xxx  ratio in densitometric units was calculated with the doc-it®ls image analysis software (uvp inc).

5-ht uptake studies

biotinylation and purification of cell surface proteins

uptake measurements were performed on cells attached to
24-well plates either under control conditions or after treatment
with fluoxetine. the 5-ht uptake conditions have been chosen
according to previous experiments (iceta et al., 2006). the

protein biotinylation was carried out with a cell surface
protein biotinylation and purification kit (pierce, rockford, il,
usa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly,

pbs and incubated with sulfo-nhs-ss-biotin for 90 min at
4 °c. after quenching, the cells were scraped and centrifuged at
500×g for 3 min. the pellet was re-suspended with lysis buffer
and the cells disrupted by sonication (five 1 s bursts, 60 w). one
sample was taken from the lysate for total protein analysis and
protein quantification. the cell lysate was centrifuged at
15,000×g for 10 min. the supernatant was added to a column
with immobilised neutravidin gel and after incubation for 1 h,
the mixture was centrifuged at 1000×g for 1 min and the flowthrough was discarded. the column was washed with washing
buffer and centrifuged at 1000×g for 1 min three times. finally,
sds–page sample buffer containing 50 mm dtt was added
to the gel in the column, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h.
the column was centrifuged for 2 min at 1000×g and the flowthrough used for western blotting analysis.
western blotting
purified cell surface protein samples and cell lysate (60 mug of
total protein) from caco-2 cells were electrophoresed in 9%
sds–page gels, and then transferred to pvdf membranes by
electroblotting. the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
dried milk plus 1% bsa, and probed with a rabbit polyclonal
anti-rat sert 1:5000 (ab1594, chemicon, temecula, ca,
usa). the primary antibody was detected using a secondary
donkey anti-rabbit ig coupled to horseradish peroxidase (santa
cruz biotechnologies, ca, usa) and the ecl plus detection
kit (amersham biosciences) and visualized with x-ray films
(hyperfilm mp, amersham biosciences). the blots were
reprobed, after stripping, with both a rabbit polyclonal antibody
anti- xxxg334xxx  (endoplasmic reticular membrane protein) (santa
cruz biotechnologies) to validate the surface biotinylation on
plasma membrane proteins, and with a rabbit polyclonal antiactin antibody to determine differences in the sample load. the
 xxxg2150xxx / xxxg53xxx  protein ratio was calculated from the films with
the doc-it®ls image analysis software (uvp inc) and the
results were expressed in densitometric units.
statistical analysis
all results are expressed as means ± sem. statistical
comparisons were performed by the paired t-test with a
confidence interval of 99% (p b 0.01). kinetic analysis of the
5-ht transport values was performed by non-linear regression,
fitting the results to an equation containing a saturable
(michaelis–menten) plus a non-saturable (diffusion) component. calculation of 5-ht transport kinetic constants and ic50
and the statistical analysis were carried out by the computerassisted prism graphpad program (prism version 4.0).

was maintained for 4 days, until day 14 of culture. preliminary
experiments have demonstrated that these conditions are optimal to detect the fluoxetine effect on  xxxg2150xxx . fig. 1 shows that
the treatment with fluoxetine significantly diminished the 5-ht
uptake in caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent way. the
treatment with fluoxetine 1 mum blocked 5-ht uptake and the
ic50 was found to be 17.5 nm.
reversibility and time dependence of the effect of fluoxetine
treatment on 5-ht uptake
the long-term effect of fluoxetine on  xxxg2150xxx  activity may be
irreversible. in order to clarify this, the reversibility of the effect
of fluoxetine treatment on 5-ht uptake was determined under
three different experimental conditions: control group (untreated cells); cells treated with fluoxetine 100 nm for 4 days; and
cells treated with fluoxetine for 4 days plus a period of recovery
(1, 2, 4 or 6 days). treatment of the cells with fluoxetine started
on day 5 after confluence (day 10 after seeding). the recovery
was carried out by adding standard culture medium (see
methods) to caco-2 cells during the recovery period assayed.
these conditions have been depicted in the upper part of fig. 2.
the results show that inhibition of 5-ht uptake progressively
disappears after withdrawal of fluoxetine treatment (fig. 2). we
also determined whether the effect of fluoxetine depends on the
duration of the treatment. so, cells were treated with fluoxetine
100 nm for 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 days, and the effect compared with
the control cells (untreated) at the same degree of differentiation. the results show that the effect of fluoxetine is not significantly altered by the duration of the treatment (fig. 3).
kinetic study of the 5-ht uptake in caco-2 cells treated with
fluoxetine
uptake of 5-ht was measured at different concentrations
(range 0.05–50 mum) in caco-2 cells treated with two different
fluoxetine concentrations (50 and 100 nm) for 4 days (from day
10 to day 14 of culture after seeding). the kinetic constants
vmax (maximum velocity of transport), kt and kd were calculated as indicated in methods. the values obtained (table 1)
show that treatment with fluoxetine affects 5-ht uptake mainly

effect of fluoxetine treatment on  xxxg2150xxx  protein expression
since the former results obtained seem to indicate a posttranscriptional effect of fluoxetine,  xxxg2150xxx  protein expression
was analysed by western blotting of both cell lysate (total
protein) and purified cell surface protein obtained after
biotinylation (cell membrane protein). caco-2 cells were treated
with fluoxetine 1 mum for 4 days, from day 10 to day 14 of
culture after seeding. the results in fig. 5 show that availability
of  xxxg2150xxx  was dramatically reduced in the cell membrane, with

the effect of fluoxetine on  xxxg2150xxx  seems to be due to a
reduction in the availability of  xxxg2150xxx  in the cell membrane
without affecting either its transcription or translation. one of
the most described internalisation mechanisms for cell membrane proteins is phosphorylation mediated by intracellular
kinases. the role of pkc and camp (pka way) in the effect of
fluoxetine on sert was analysed in order to gain an in-depth
knowledge of the fluoxetine mechanism. uptake of 5-ht was
measured in caco-2 cells treated simultaneously with
fluoxetine (10 nm) and either phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate
(pma), an activator of pkc, or dibutyryl-camp (d-camp), a
non-metabolisable analogue of camp, and either  xxxd2195xxx  ii (bis) or kt 5720 (kt), inhibitors of pkc or
pka respectively. the fluoxetine concentration assayed was
10 nm to obtain a partial inhibition of  xxxg2150xxx  which permits
the detection of additive effects. the results show that either
pma or d-camp diminished the 5-ht uptake, and this effect
was additive to the reduction yielded by fluoxetine. however,
the fluoxetine effect was not reverted by either bis, the
pkc inhibitor, or kt, the pka inhibitor. these inhibitors significantly reverted the pma and d-camp effect on
the 5-ht uptake without affecting the 5-ht uptake themselves
(fig. 6).
discussion and conclusions
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are the most
widely used antidepressants in mood disorders and are also
administered in some gastrointestinal disorders. although
ssris rapidly inhibit the uptake of 5-ht, maximal therapeutic
effects are obtained only after a long repeated treatment. this
fact suggests that, in addition to the inhibition of the 5-ht

reuptake, other long-term adaptive changes occur that contribute to therapeutic efficacy.
recent studies have been carried out to determine the
association of sert mutations with the ssris acute response
by using several cellular models (roman et al., 2003; zhang and
rudnick, 2005; henry et al., 2006); however their results do not
clarify the therapeutic long-term effect of fluoxetine. on the
other hand results obtained with in vivo studies of long-term
antidepressant-induced regulation of sert have yielded
contradictory conclusions (hrdina and vu, 1993; lopez et al.,
1994; lesch et al., 1993; watanabe et al., 1993; kuroda et al.,
1994; piñeyro et al., 1994; neumaier et al., 1996; cheetham
et al., 1993; burnet et al., 1994; spurlock et al., 1994; gobbi
et al., 1997).
fluoxetine is one of the most widely used ssris in therapy.
in order to clarify the long-term effect of fluoxetine on  xxxg2150xxx 
we have used the caco-2 cell line (human enterocyte-like cell
line) that has been shown to be an excellent model for the study
of  xxxg2150xxx  (iceta et al., 2006). in this study we treated the caco-2
cells with fluoxetine for several days in order to determine its
long-term effect, and measured different aspects of  xxxg2150xxx 's
function and its molecular expression. the results have shown
that treatment with fluoxetine reduced 5-ht uptake carried out
by  xxxg2150xxx  and this effect was concentration-dependent (ic50
was 17.5 nm). this value was similar to the ic50 obtained in
acute treatment of the cells (iceta et al., 2006; martel et al.,
2003; roman et al., 2003). fluoxetine is a molecule that acts by
binding to the serotonin transporter, so this effect may be due to
the increase in the number of  xxxg2150xxx  molecules that binds
fluoxetine irreversibly in these cells. this possibility was
rejected since firstly 5-ht uptake inhibition was reversed when
the fluoxetine treatment was withdrawn and secondly, in all the
experiments, 5-ht uptake was measured after 6 h of culture in
medium without fluoxetine. these results suggest that the
inhibitory effect of fluoxetine treatment may not be due to the
blockade of the transporter (acute effect) and that other mechanisms might be involved. a possible effect of fluoxetine on
caco-2 activity and differentiation was also rejected by measuring  xxxg163xxx  activity (a specific enzymatic activity
of the enterocytes dependent on cellular differentiation) in
fluoxetine treated cells compared with control cells, without
obtaining any difference (data not shown).
to learn more on the long-term effect of fluoxetine, it was
important to clarify the molecular involvement of  xxxg2150xxx  under
conditions of fluoxetine treatment. for this purpose, one
approach was to determine the effect on the kinetic parameters.
thus, the kinetic study showed a reduction in vmax in cells
treated with fluoxetine, indicating that this antidepressant may
affect the availability of the  xxxg2150xxx  molecules in the cell
membrane. in order to clarify the intracellular mechanism
involved in the fluoxetine effect, the  xxxg2150xxx  mrna levels were
measured by semiquantitative rt-pcr. results showed no
alteration in  xxxg2150xxx  mrna levels in caco-2 cells treated with
fluoxetine compared with untreated cells. similar results have
been obtained in rat brain in vivo studies based on either in situ
hybridisation after treatment with paroxetine and sertraline
(benmansour et al., 1999) or northern blot analysis after treat-

ment with fluoxetine (koed and linnet, 1997). other authors
have reported an mrna decrease with imipramine or fluoxetine
treatment (lesch et al., 1993; neumaier et al., 1996) or an
increase with imipramine treatment (lopez et al., 1994). since
these in vivo studies have been carried out in brains of rats
treated with different antidepressants, not only the protocol for
administering antidepressant, but also the interference of
different physiological processes and the brain area analysed
may be responsible for the contradictory results.
in our results the  xxxg2150xxx  mrna levels were not modified by
fluoxetine treatment, suggesting that fluoxetine may not affect
 xxxg2150xxx  transcription. nevertheless, the  xxxg2150xxx  activity was
inhibited by the treatment with fluoxetine and a possible alteration of the protein synthesis cannot be discarded. in fact, recent
results have shown that the long-term fluoxetine administration
yields a region-specific regulation of translation factors in rat
brain (dagestad et al., 2006). in our study the results obtained
by western blotting of both the purified cell surface protein and
the total protein showed that the treatment with fluoxetine
mainly affects the cell membrane's  xxxg2150xxx  content. similar
effects have been obtained (benmansour et al., 1999) in a
careful study in brain of rats treated with paroxetine and
sertraline, which detected a reduction of sert density after
chronic treatment. nevertheless, other authors have reported no
change in sert density in rat brain after chronic treatment with
citalopram and fluoxetine (gobbi et al., 1997). in a study carried
out on platelets from humans in a control group and those
diagnosed with mood disorders, treatment with fluoxetine
reduced 5-ht transport but did not modify  xxxg2150xxx  density
measured by labelling with [3h]paroxetine (bakish et al., 1997).
differences in the effect might be due in part to the different
accuracy of the sert protein detection. in our experiments,
total cell  xxxg2150xxx  protein level was not modified by fluoxetine
treatment, suggesting that fluoxetine may not affect  xxxg2150xxx 
protein synthesis, which is in part corroborated by the lack of
fluoxetine effect on  xxxg2150xxx  mrna expression.
the mechanism by which fluoxetine reduces  xxxg2150xxx  protein
level in the membrane is not known; however, from the results
of this study it might be hypothesised that treatment with
fluoxetine induces regulation at the post-translational level.
recent studies in rats treated with fluoxetine have concluded
that the treatment yields a modulation of phosphorylation
processes in the brain (fumagalli et al., 2005), and previous
results obtained in our laboratory have shown that long-term
treatment of caco-2 cells with either pkc or pka activators
reduced the  xxxg2150xxx  function (iceta et al., 2006). since the
capacity of sert has been shown to be regulated by kinaselinked pathways producing transporter phosphorylation and
internalisation (ramamoorthy and blakely, 1999), the reduction
in both the transport rate and the availability of sert in the cell
membrane produced by fluoxetine treatment might be mediated
by either pkc or camp. however, our results show that the
inhibitory effect of pma or d-camp was additive to the effect
of the fluoxetine treatment and, furthermore, that the fluoxetine
effect was not reversed by specific pkc or pka inhibitors.
consequently, the effect of fluoxetine treatment did not seem to
be mediated by these kinases. future studies are needed to

r. iceta et al. / life sciences 80 (2007) 1517–1524

clarify the intracellular mechanism involved in the long-term
fluoxetine effect on sert.
the results of this paper demonstrate that long-term treatment with fluoxetine produces an adaptive change in  xxxg2150xxx ,
resulting in enhanced serotoninergic activity, even though the
antidepressant treatment may yield more complex changes
involving other tissues and processes not included in our cell
culture study.
in summary this study determines the long-term effect of
fluoxetine on  xxxg2150xxx  in caco-2 cells. this ssri diminishes
 xxxg2150xxx  activity in a concentration-dependent and reversible
way. this effect seems to be due to the reduction in  xxxg2150xxx 
capacity by diminishing the availability of the transporter in the
cell membrane with no alteration in mrna expression, and
seems to be pkc and camp-independent. these results may be
useful to clarify the effect of fluoxetine therapy in both
gastrointestinal and central nervous system disorders.
