introduction

 xxxd81xxx -activated kinase (prka) is a
 xxxg1377xxx  that functions as a metabolic switch in
a number of physiological functions. the present study was
undertaken to assess the role of this kinase in nuclear maturation
of porcine oocytes. rt-pcr and immunoblotting revealed the
expression of the  xxxg1830xxx  subunit in granulosa cells, cumulusoocyte complexes (coc), and denuded oocytes (do). porcine
coc and do contained transcripts that corresponded to the
expected sizes of the designed primers for  xxxg1831xxx  and
prkag1. the prkaa2 subunit was detected in granulosa cells
and coc, whereas the prkag3 subunit was not detected in
granulosa cells, coc or do, whereas it was detected in the
heart. the  xxxg1830xxx  protein was detected in granulosa cells,
coc, do, and zona pellucida (zp). in the presence of the
pharmacological activator of prka 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl 5’-monophosphate (zmp), coc
were transiently maintained in meiotic arrest in a fully reversible
manner. this inhibitory effect was not observed in do. other
known prka activators, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1beta-d-ribofuranoside (aicar) and metformin, also blocked
meiotic resumption in coc. in contrast to mouse oocytes, in
which prka activators reverse the inhibitory effect of  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitors, this combination still blocked meiotic resumption in
porcine coc. these results demonstrate that the meiotic
resumption of porcine coc is transiently blocked by prka
activators in a dose-dependent manner, and that this effect is
dependent on prka activity in cumulus cells. the present study
describes a new role for prka in regulating meiotic resumption
in coc and strongly suggests that cumulus cells play an essential
role in the control of porcine oocyte maturation through the
prka metabolic switch.

meiosis in mammalian oocytes begins during fetal life [1]. it
progresses to prophase i and stops at the dictyate stage or
germinal vesicle stage (gv) for up to several years. the oocyte
resumes meiosis in vivo following the ovulatory surge in
lutenizing hormone [2, 3], whereas in vitro, oocytes spontaneously resume meiosis once they are removed from the
follicular environment [4]. the first morphological sign of
meiotic resumption is the breakdown of the nuclear membrane
or germinal vesicle breakdown (gvbd). the second messenger camp plays a key role in the regulation of oocyte
maturation [5]. however, the exact mechanism whereby camp
maintains the oocyte in meiotic arrest is not fully understood.
in most species, a high intracellular level of camp in the
oocyte maintains meiotic arrest [6–9], whereas a low level of
camp allows meiotic resumption [10–12]. phosphodiesterases
(pdes) are enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides (cgmp
and camp) to their inactive forms (5 0 -gmp and 5 0 -amp,
respectively). inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide pdes [13–20] and
membrane-permeable analogs of camp, such as dibutyrilcamp and 8-bromo-3 0 ,5 0 -camp [5, 7, 11, 21–23], prevent
spontaneous meiotic resumption.
until recently,  xxxd81xxx  (amp) was
considered to be an inactive product of camp degradation
by pdes. however, it has become clear that amp is a potent
allosteric activator of  xxxd81xxx  kinase
(prka; formerly known as ampk) [24]. this member of
the prka/snf1 protein kinase family is a well-conserved
heterotrimeric protein with a 63-kda catalytic  xxxg220xxx 
(prkaa) and regulatory b (prkab) and c subunits (38
kda and 35 kda, respectively) [25, 26]. the a ( xxxg1830xxx  and
prkaa2) and b ( xxxg1831xxx  and  xxxg1832xxx ) subunits have two
known isoforms, whereas the c subunit has three isoforms
(prkag1, prkag2 and prkag3). there are at least 12
possible heterotrimeric combinations, since all of the isoforms
appear to be capable of forming complexes [25, 27, 28]. this
ser/thr kinase phosphorylates a range of metabolic enzymes
[29] and has been implicated in an increasing number of
physiological functions, including exercise [30], glucose
uptake [31, 32], glycolysis [33], transcriptional regulation
[34], lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and sterol synthesis [35].
typically, prka is activated by an increase in the ratio of
amp to atp [29, 36]. however, activation of prka can occur
by allosteric activation, stimulation of phosphorylation of the a
subunit on thr-172 by upstream kinase(s) or inhibition of
dephosphorylation by phosphatases [37–39]. there is good
evidence that some, if not all, of these effects are antagonized
by high concentrations of atp [36]. in intact cells, prka can
be activated with the adenosine analog 5-aminoimidazole-4-

carboxamide-1-b-d-ribofuranoside (aicar) [40]. this adenosine analog, which is cell-permeable, is phosphorylated by
 xxxg79xxx  and accumulates in the cytoplasm as zmp (5aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-d-ribofuranosyl 5’-monophosphate), which in turn activates prka without disturbing
the cellular amp:atp ratio [40]. recently, it has been shown
that metformin also stimulates prka without altering the
amp:atp ratio [41–43]. metformin is the most widely used
drug for reducing blood sugar in type 2 diabetic patients [44]
and for the treatment of anovulation in women with polycystic
ovary syndrome (pcos) [45].
recent reports implicate prka in the regulation of mouse
oocyte maturation [21, 46, 47]. the activation of prka results
in meiotic resumption of mouse oocytes maintained in meiotic
arrest by a camp analog [46, 47]. since the molecular
mechanisms that govern oocyte maturation are notably
different between rodents and non-rodent animals, the present
study was undertaken to evaluate the role of prka activators
in porcine oocyte maturation.
materials and methods
collection of ovaries
ovaries were collected from pre-pubertal gilts at a local slaughterhouse and
transported in a thermos that contained saline solution (0.9% nacl)
supplemented with 100 000 iu/l  xxxd2871xxx , 100 mg/l streptomycin, and
250 mg/l  xxxd164xxx . ovaries were maintained at 348c and rinsed with
saline upon arrival.

chemicals
the specific  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor cilostamide (cil) was purchased from biomol
(plymouth meeting, pa) and the non-specific pde inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1methylxanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ) was obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,
mo). millimolar stock concentrations of pde inhibitor were dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and stored at 208c. the chemicals were added to
the maturation medium approximately 4 h before the initiation of oocyte
culture. the final concentrations of dmso in culture medium never exceeded
0.1%. the control treatment consisted of oocytes incubated in medium without
inhibitors or dmso. millimolar stocks of zmp and aicar were dissolved in
the maturation medium and stored at 208c. aicar was purchased from
toronto research chemicals (north york, on). metformin and all the other
chemicals used in the present study were purchased from sigma.

media
oocytes were matured in bsa-free ncsu 23 (north carolina state
university) medium [48] that was supplemented with 25 lm  xxxd26xxx  (bio-rad, hercules, ca), 0.1 mg/ml cysteine, 10% (v/v)
porcine follicular fluid, and gonadotropins (final concentrations of 2.5 iu/ml
for hcg [apl; ayerst laboratories inc., philadelphia, pa] and 2.5 iu/ml for
ecg [folligon; intervet, whitby, on, canada]), as previously described [15,
49]. porcine follicular fluid (pff) was collected from follicles (2–6 mm in

diameter) of pre-pubertal gilt ovaries using an 18g needle and a 10-ml syringe.
after centrifugation at 1500 3 g for 30 min at room temperature, the
supernatant was filtered though 0.8-lm and 0.45-lm syringe filters and stored
at 208c until used [15].

collection of cumulus-oocyte complexes
porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (coc) were collected as described by
bureau and collaborators [49]. follicles measuring 2–6 mm in diameter were
aspirated with a 10-ml syringe and an 18g needle. the follicular contents were
pooled in 50-ml conical tubes (falcon, franklin lakes, nj). after
sedimentation, the pellet was washed twice in pff. coc were recovered with
the use of a stereomicroscope and transferred to a petri dish that contained the
supernatant of the follicular fluid. the coc were washed three times with
hepes-buffered tyrode medium that contained 0.01% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol
(pva-tlh) [50], and then subjected to their respective treatments. groups of
25 to 30 coc were transferred into the wells of four-well multi-dishes (nunc,
roskilde, denmark) that contained 500 ll of maturation medium and 500 ll of
 xxxd2648xxx . the coc were cultured at 38.58c in an atmosphere of 5% co2 in
air and 100% humidity. the culture medium was supplemented with
gonadotropins once the oocytes were in culture.

selection of coc and preparation of denuded oocytes
cultured coc were rigorously selected as previously described [15].
briefly, the selected coc had at least three layers of clear and compact
cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. oocytes with dark, pycnotic or expanded
cumulus cells at the time of selection were discarded. in addition, oocytes with
a very clear cytoplasm or small diameter were discarded. denuded oocytes
(do) were obtained by removing the cumulus cells from selected coc before
culture. briefly, coc were transferred into a 2-ml centrifuge tube that
contained 60 ll of pva-tlh and repeatedly pipetted up and down until the
cumulus cells were completely removed. the oocytes were rinsed twice in
maturation medium. the do were recovered under a stereomicroscope.
completely denuded oocytes with homogeneous cytoplasm were then allocated
to their respective treatments. porcine zona pellucidas (zps) were obtained by
forcibly passing do through a 27g needle and a 1 ml syringe in pva-tlh
until the oocytes were ruptured. the zps were recovered under a
stereomicroscope, rinsed three times in pva-tlh, and stored at 808c until
needed.

evaluation of nuclear maturation
the stages of nuclear maturation were evaluated as previously described
[15]. after 24 h in a fixative solution (ethanol:acetic acid, 3:1), the stages of
nuclear maturation of the oocytes were evaluated under a contrast microscope
at 1003 and 4003 magnification immediately after staining with 1% acetoorcein [51]. oocytes that contained a nuclear membrane were classified as
being at the germinal vesicle (gv) stage, while those without a nuclear
membrane were classified as having undergone meiotic resumption or germinal
vesicle breakdown (gvbd).

rna extraction and rt-pcr
total rna was extracted according to the protocol provided with the
absolutely rna microprep kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca). total rna isolated
was reversed-transcribed into cdna using poly(dt) primer (ambion, austin,

tx) with the omniscript rt kit (qiagen, valencia, ca) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. pcr reactions were carried out under the
following conditions: denaturation at 958c for 1 min, annealing at 578c for 1
min, and extension at 728c for 2 min, for a total of 30 ( xxxg53xxx ) or 35 (other
genes) cycles, with a final extension step of 10 min at 728c. the taq
polymerase was purchased from new england biolabs (beverly, ma). the
pcr primers (table 1) were designed according to the database sequences: bos
taurus  xxxg53xxx  (accession number ay_141970.1; 242 bp); homo sapiens
 xxxg1830xxx  ( xxxg1830xxx ; 523 bp); homo sapiens prkaa2 (nm_006252, 255
bp); homo sapiens  xxxg1831xxx  ( xxxg1831xxx , 230 bp); homo sapiens prkag1
(nm_002733, 244 bp); and homo sapiens prkag3 (aj_249977, 268 bp).
additional amplifications were performed on an equivalent amount of rna to
exclude genomic dna contamination. amplified fragments were visualized by
1% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. in order to
validate the purity of the preparations, pcr reactions were carried out with 1 ll
of the extracted total rna serving as a template. the potential introduction of
foreign dna was monitored by performing the pcr reactions without adding
any template to the master mix. the pcr products were sequenced and aligned
with the known sequences from which the primers were designed.

foster city, ca). the following percentages sequence identity
were obtained: for  xxxg1830xxx  ( xxxg1830xxx , 96%); prkaa2
(nm_006252, 100%);  xxxg1831xxx  ( xxxg1831xxx , 91%); and
prkag1 (nm_002733, 100%) (table 1). western blot
analysis of  xxxg1830xxx  showed a positive signal at the expected
molecular weight of 63 kda in control porcine heart [54] and
granulosa cells (fig. 2a). the presence of  xxxg1830xxx  in the
porcine heart [55] and skeletal muscle [56] has been reported

incubation of porcine coc in the presence of increasing
concentrations of the prka activator zmp (0, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50,
1.00 mm) increased the percentage of oocytes at the gv stage.
the effect of this prka activator was significant at 0.50 and
1.00 mm zmp (fig. 3). the effective concentration (ec50) of
zmp was estimated to be 0.41 mm. the inhibitory effect of 1
mm zmp in porcine oocyte maturation was observed after 22 h
of culture (fig. 4). however, after 44 h of continuous exposure
to zmp, almost all the oocytes had resumed meiosis and no
significant difference was observed with the control. these
data suggest that zmp transiently blocks meiotic resumption in
porcine oocytes. other known activators of prka, such as
aicar and metformin, were also effective in blocking oocyte
meiotic resumption. coc treated with 1 mm of either aicar
(fig. 5a) or metformin (fig. 5b) showed a significant increase
(p , 0.05) in the percentage of coc arrested at the gv stage
compared to the control treatment. in these same experiments,
meiotic resumption occurred after a second culture period of 24
h in prka activator-free medium (fig. 5, a and b). these data
support the efficacy of three prka activators to block
reversibly nuclear maturation in porcine coc. the efficacies
with which zmp and metformin activated prka were
confirmed using the signalscout kinase profiling system for
prka (stratagene). no prka activity was detected in coc at
0 h. however, a twofold increase in prka activity was
measured in coc treated with zmp or metformin after 3 h of

culture, as shown previously in several cell types [40, 42, 43,
46].
effects of zmp with pde inhibitors on meiotic resumption
to date, the only reports of prka regulation of oocyte
maturation are in the mouse, in which prka activators induce
resumption of meiosis, including oocytes arrested with
phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors [47]. the following
experiments were designed to test this mechanism in a nonrodent oocyte model. coc treated with cilostamide (specific
pde inhibitor) or  xxxd2388xxx  (broad-spectrum inhibitor) remained
in meiotic arrest compared to control- and dmso-treated coc
(fig. 6a). coc incubated in presence of 2 mm of zmp also
remained in meiotic arrest (figs. 3 and 6a). the combination
of this high dose of zmp with pde inhibitors (cilostamide or
 xxxd2388xxx ) did not show any statistical difference from their
respective controls (p . 0.05). together, these results suggest
that the 2 mm zmp does not reverse the inhibitory effects of
broad-spectrum and specific pde inhibitors on porcine
oocytes.
porcine coc were incubated in the presence of 20 lm
cilostamide and different doses of zmp to evaluate whether a
specific dose of zmp could reverse the inhibitory effect of the
specific  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor on oocyte maturation. in coc, the
specific  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor cilostamide maintained oocytes at the
gv stage (68.1 6 7.7%; fig. 6b). a range of zmp doses did
not have any significant effect when treated in combination
with cilostamide (fig. 6b). all treatments were fully reversible,
since treated oocytes resumed meiosis when incubated for an
additional 24 h in compound-free medium (fig. 6c).
zmp alone maintained oocytes in meiotic arrest when
administered to coc (figs. 3 and 4; fig. 6, a and b).
however, in do, zmp did not have a significant effect (p .
0.05) on the percentage of oocytes at the gv stage compared to
the control and dmso (fig. 7). the inefficiency of prka
activator at maintaining oocytes in meiotic arrest is not due to
the absence of prka protein in the porcine oocyte (fig. 2d),
zp (fig. 2e) or pff (fig. 2f). these data provide evidence that
zmp activates prka and transiently delays meiotic resumption in porcine oocytes, but requires the presence of cumulus
cells to exert its effect on oocyte maturation.
discussion
the present study demonstrates that the meiotic resumption
of porcine coc is transiently blocked by prka activators in a
dose-dependent manner. the lack of effect of prka activators
on denuded oocytes strongly suggests that cumulus cells play
an essential role in the control of porcine oocyte maturation via
the prka signaling cascade.
recently, the role of prka in the regulation of oocyte
maturation in mice has been reported [47]. mouse oocytes
remain in meiotic arrest when treated with camp analogs or
pde inhibitors, such as hypoxanthine [57–60]. activators of
prka reverse the inhibitory effects of camp analogs and pde
inhibitors, thereby inducing meiotic resumption [47]. our
results using porcine oocytes dramatically contrast with these
findings in the mouse. several lines of evidence presented in
the present study demonstrate that well-known activators of
prka transiently inhibit meiotic resumption (figs. 3–5).
furthermore, these agents do not overcome the inhibitory effect
of pde inhibitors on oocyte maturation (fig. 6, a and b), as
they do in mouse oocytes [47]. in addition, prka activators
did not have an effect on the maturation of porcine do (fig. 7).
collectively, these findings demonstrate a novel role for prka
in the regulation of oocyte maturation in a non-rodent model.

the activation of prka is generally achieved in vitro with
either aicar or zmp. most studies use aicar to activate
prka. however, the activation of prka by aicar is
dependent upon the activity of  xxxg79xxx , which
transforms aicar into zmp. the present study uses zmp,
which is an analog of 5 0 -amp, to activate directly prka. the
role of prka in porcine meiotic resumption was validated
using both prka activators (figs. 3 and 5a). the concentration of aicar commonly used for other cell types, such as
skeletal muscle cells [61, 62], endothelial cells [63], and dermal
fibroblasts [64], is 1 mm. furthermore, the findings that the
treatments were reversible and within the range of the effective
concentration (ec50) strongly suggest that the observed results
are not due to product toxicity. metformin is reported to
activate prka in rat hepatocytes and rat skeletal muscles [41,
43]. our results show that metformin also maintains porcine
coc in a state of meiotic arrest (fig. 5b). the fact that all of
the prka activators used in the present study reversibly
maintained porcine coc at the gv stage strongly supports the
role of prka in the regulation of porcine oocyte maturation.
important differences exist in the regulation of oocyte
meiotic resumption between rodent and non-rodent animals.
the first difference is the time it takes for oocytes to undergo
meiotic resumption. in mice, meiotic resumption occurs within
2 to 3 h of  xxxd2409xxx , depending on the culture conditions, whereas
in pigs, meiotic resumption is observed only after 20 h. the
second important difference is that mouse oocytes resume
meiosis in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors [65, 66],
whereas porcine and bovine oocytes remain in meiotic arrest
[66–69], which demonstrates a requirement for protein
synthesis to resume meiosis. the third difference is the role
that cumulus cells play in the control of meiotic resumption. in
mice, cumulus cells secrete a meiosis-activating substance [70,
71]. porcine cumulus cells secrete progesterone to modulate
meiotic resumption [72, 73]. the fourth difference is that rna
transcription is also required in porcine cumulus cells [74].
furthermore, prka activators are effective in mouse coc and
do [47], whereas in pigs they are effective in coc but not in
do, as shown in the present study. the inability of prka
activators to prevent meiotic resumption in porcine do is not
due to the lack of a functional prka, since immunoblotting
revealed the presence of  xxxg1830xxx  in porcine do, zp, and
follicular fluid. thus, it appears that mammalian oocyte
maturation is efficiently modulated by prka, whereby the
oocyte is the effective site of action in the mouse [47], whereas
the cumulus cells are the target in porcine coc.
prka has several physiological roles. prka is involved in
the purine biosynthesis pathway. mutations of the aicar
transformylase, which transforms aicar into faicar,
induce errors in purine biosynthesis [75]. faicar can enter
the purine biosynthesis pathway through its conversion by
 xxxd557xxx  cyclohydrolase into  xxxd557xxx  [76]. the prka activators aicar and zmp can
enter the purine biosynthesis pathway. a convergent point of
these compounds may be  xxxd557xxx  [77, 78].
newly synthesized purines from these pharmacological
compounds could then produce inosine and block meiotic
resumption. in vitro, inosine does not block meiotic resumption
of porcine oocytes (data not shown), which suggests that this
pathway is not involved in blocking porcine oocyte maturation.
a second activity of prka is its ability to regulate
transcription [34]. interestingly, activation of prka reduces
the activity of rna polymerase i (pol i), which carries out
the transcription of rrna [79]. the activation of prka by
aicar inhibits key enzymes in protein synthesis, e.g., mtor
[80], p70s6k [81], and ef2 [82]. in rat hepatocytes, prka

prka activators in pig oocyte maturation

activation controls protein synthesis [82]. an inhibitor of
protein synthesis, cycloheximide, maintains porcine oocytes in
meiotic arrest even in the absence of cumulus cells [83]. given
that prka activators transiently maintain porcine coc in
meiotic arrest and that cumulus cells are required, this suggests
that prka activators do not directly inhibit protein synthesis in
the oocyte.
the maturation of mammalian coc requires the availability
of energy sources [84]. it is known that glucose uptake in
bovine oocytes is very low [85, 86], whereas glucose is highly
metabolized in the cumulus cells [87]. cumulus cells increase
glucose utilization by up to 25% during in vitro maturation
[87]. in the present study, porcine coc were matured in
ncsu-23 [48], which contains glucose (5.5 mm) and
glutamine (1 mm) as energy sources. glucose availability
has a significant effect on the progression of oocyte maturation
[88, 89] and it appears to be required for the completion of
meiosis [88, 90]. the culture of porcine oocytes in low levels
of glucose delays oocyte maturation but has little consequence
in terms of developmental competence [88, 91]. these findings
suggest that there is a correlation between the levels of energy
substrates and meiotic progression. since prka is the key
metabolic sensor of cellular energy status [30, 37, 39],
treatment of cells with zmp triggers the physiological response
of cells under energy stress and redirects the use of glucose.
thus, cumulus cells are essential to mediate the effect(s) of
zmp. it is possible that the transient delay in meiotic
resumption is the result of a physiological response of porcine
cumulus cells to signals that indicate low energy levels. these
results suggest that modulation of the energy status of the
cumulus cells in porcine coc is an effective way to delay
meiotic resumption. thus, it will be important to investigate the
energetic needs of cumulus cells to improve in vitro maturation
media.
in conclusion, the results presented in the present study
demonstrate the presence of  xxxg1830xxx  in porcine granulosa
cells, coc, and do. prka activators transiently block
meiotic resumption in coc. the differential actions of prka
activators on coc versus do demonstrate the requirement for
cumulus cells to mediate the inhibitory effect. additional
experiments are necessary to identify the inhibitory factor(s)
produced by the cumulus cells that control nuclear maturation
in porcine oocytes. the present study further illustrates
fundamental differences between species in the regulation of
oocyte maturation. the role of prka in the maturation of
other non-rodent oocytes, including human oocytes, remains to
be elucidated.
