signal transduction underlying carbachol-induced contraction of human urinary bladder.  the present study was designed to reexamine the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype mediating carbachol-induced contraction of human urinary bladder and to investigate the underlying signal transduction. based upon the nonselective  xxxd3398xxx , the highly m(2)-selective (r)-4-[2-[3-(4-methoxy-benzoylamino)-benzyl]-piperidin-1-ylmethyl]piperidine-1-carboxylic  xxxd2716xxx  (ro-320-6206), and the highly m(3)-selective  xxxd1813xxx  and 3-(1-carbamoyl-1,1-diphenylmethyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenylethyl)pyrrolidine (app), contraction occurs via m(3) receptors. the phospholipase c inhibitor 1-(6-[([17beta]-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5[10]-trien-17-yl)amino]hexyl)-1h-pyrrole-2,5-dione (u 73,122) (1-10 microm) did not significantly affect carbachol-stimulated bladder contraction. the phospholipase d inhibitor butan-1-ol relative to its negative control butan-2-ol (0.3% each) caused small but detectable inhibition of carbachol-induced bladder contraction. the ca(2+) entry blocker nifedipine (10-100 nm) strongly inhibited carbachol-induced bladder contraction. in contrast, 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1h-imidazole hcl (sk&f 96,365) (1-10 microm), an inhibitor of store-operated ca(2+) channels, caused little inhibition. the protein kinase c inhibitor  xxxd2195xxx  i (1-10 microm) did not significantly affected carbachol-induced bladder contraction. in contrast, trans-4-[(1r)-1-aminoethyl]-n-4-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide (y 27,632) (1-10 microm), an inhibitor of rho-associated kinases, concentration dependently and effectively attenuated the carbachol responses. we conclude that carbachol-induced contraction of human urinary bladder via m(3) receptors largely depends on ca(2+) entry through nifedipine-sensitive channels and activation of a  xxxg1969xxx , whereas phospholipase d and store-operated ca(2+) channels contribute only in a minor way. surprisingly, phospholipase c or protein kinase c do not seem to be involved to a relevant extent.
