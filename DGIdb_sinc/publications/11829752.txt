ms-1, a high-molecular-mass protein expressed by non-continuous and angiogenic endothelial cells and by alternatively
activated macrophages (mphi2), and the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial hyaluronan clearance receptor are similar with respect
to tissue distribution and biochemical characteristics. in the
present study we purified these proteins by immuno- and
hyaluronan-affinity chromatography respectively, sequenced
tryptic peptides and generated full-length cdna sequences in
both mouse and human. the novel genes, i.e. stabilin-1 and
 xxxg2211xxx , code for homologous transmembrane proteins
featuring seven fasciclin-like adhesion domains, 18–20 epidermalgrowth-factor domains, one x-link domain and three to six b(x )-b hyaluronan-binding motifs. northern-blotting experi(
ments revealed the presence of both stabilins in organs with
predominant endothelial sinuses such as liver, spleen and lymph

node : stabilin-1 mrna was also detected in organs with
predominant mphi2 cells, such as placenta, and in interleukin4\glucocorticoid-stimulated mphi2 cells in itro. a polyclonal
antibody made against human recombinant stabilin-1 confirmed
the expression of stabilin-1 protein in splenic sinus endothelial
cells in io and in mphi2 in itro. on the basis of high similarity
at the protein level and the unique domain composition, which
differs from that of all other known fasciclin-like proteins and
hyaluronan receptors, stabilin-1 and  xxxg2211xxx  define a novel
family of fasciclin-like hyaluronan receptor homologues that
might play a role in cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions in
vascular function and inflammatory processes.

introduction

mphi2 are found in immunologically privileged normal tissues
such as placenta ; they are also identified during the healing phase
of acute inflammatory reactions, in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and in woundhealing tissue [2,5,6]. ms-1+ mphi2 act as suppressor mphi [7] and
are associated with a high degree of vascularization in io. proangiogenic activity of ms-1+ mphi2 [3,8] is accompanied by
interleukin (il)-4 induced expression of fibronectin and its splice
variants and of other matrix molecules, such as the fasciclindomain-containing adhesive protein betaig-h3 [9]. ultrastructurally, the ms-1 antigen is found in mphi2 in cytoplasmic vesicles
and focally on dense plasma-membrane-associated plaques [10]
that resemble the plaque-like fibronexus serving structural integration of intracellular actin fibers and extracellular fibronectin
[11].
biochemically the ms-1 antigen occurs as two major species,
of 300 and 220 kda, and a minor form, of 120 kda ; a precursor of 280 kda is also detected that matures into the
300 kda species by complex glycosylation. the 220 and 120 kda
forms derive from the 300 kda species by proteolytic cleavage
[1].

vascular heterogeneity is the basis for the diverse functions
exerted by different sections of the vascular tree, in different
organs and during angiogenesis. among the few molecules known
to date to be differentially expressed by endothelial cells, the
monoclonal antibody (mab) ms-1 uniquely identifies a highmolecular-mass protein that, in the adult healthy organism, is
expressed by all non-continuous endothelia such as the sinusoidal
endothelial cells of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, but not by
continuous endothelia [1]. ultrastructurally, ms-1 antigen is
found on those parts of the plasma membrane of splenic
sinusoidal endothelial cells with close intercellular contacts.
endothelial expression of ms-1 antigen is also found in endothelial cells of continuous origin that undergo angiogenesis,
e.g. during wound healing, in chronic inflammation and in
malignant tumours [2,3].
besides its involvement in endothelial differentiation and
angiogenesis, the ms-1 antigen is differentially expressed by
mphi2 [alternatively activated macrophages (mphi)], i.e. polarized
antigen-presenting cells induced by th2 cytokines [4]. ms1+

similar to the ms-1 antigen, the hepatic hyaluronan (ha)
clearance receptor is expressed by liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells. it serves to remove the large amounts of ha released into
the peripheral blood during steady-state tissue remodelling, and
it protects the blood from becoming overly viscous. the hepatic
ha clearance receptor occurs as a high-molecular-mass protein
with a major species of 270 kda and a minor species of 180 kda
after ha affinity chromatography ; the ms-1 antigen was not coeluted from these columns. a polyclonal antibody made against
this protein shows that it is located on the cell surface of liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells ; it is retained in early endosomes of
these cells when recirculation of endocytic receptors is blocked
by monensin. besides ha, the hepatic ha clearance receptor also
has affinity for  xxxg484xxx , indicating a broader
scavenging function [12].
here we report on the purification and molecular characterization of the ms-1 antigen and of the hepatic ha clearance
receptor, i.e. stabilin-1 and  xxxg2211xxx . the cloning of the cdna
for human stabilin-1 (hstabilin-1) was based on the matrixassisted laser-desorption–ionization time-of-flight ms (malditof ms) analysis of the purified ms-1 antigen. the mouse
stabilin-1 (mstabilin-1) cdna was cloned by homology with the
human gene. h- and m- xxxg2211xxx  cdnas were cloned using
peptide sequences of the ha-affinity-purified rat hepatic ha
clearance receptor. stabilin-1 and -2 were expressed at a similar
level in placenta, spleen, lymph nodes and liver ; stabilin-1, but
not  xxxg2211xxx  expression was also detected in specialized endothelial cells in io and in itro as well as in mphi2. bioinformational analysis showed that the stabilins feature habinding domains and other adhesive domains such as fasciclin
and epidermal-growth-factor (egf) domains. owing to their
unique common structure, the stabilins thus constitute a novel
protein family of fasciclin-like ha receptor homologues.

experimental
cell culture, mediators and antibodies
peripheral-blood monocytes\mphi were isolated and cultured
as described in [8]. mediators were used at the following
final concentrations : il-4 (promocell g.m.b.h., heidelberg,
germany), 300 units\ml ; interferon (ifn)-gamma (tebu, le perray en
yvelines, france), 50 ng\ml ; dexamethasone (sigma), 100 nm.
kg-1, 293 and hepg2 cell lines were obtained from the german
collection of microorganisms and cell cultures (braunschweig,
germany). kg-1 cells were propagated in rpmi-1640 medium,
hepg2 and 293 were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium, both supplemented with 10 % (v\v) foetal-calf serum
and appropriate amounts of penicillin\streptomycin (all from
biochrom kg, berlin, germany). the human microvascular
endothelial-cell line cdc\eu.hmec-1 [13] was propagated
in endothelial-cell growth media (promocell). primary human
umbilical-vein endothelial cells (huvec-p) and primary
human umbilical-artery endothelial cells (huaec-p) were obtained from promocell and were also cultivated in endothelialcell growth media as was the permanent huve cell line ea.hy926,
kindly provided by dr c.-j. s. edgell, department of pathology
and laboratory medicine, university of north carolina medical
school, chapel hill, nc, u.s.a. the cell line 293-hstabilin-1
was generated by stable transfection of 293 cells with notilinearized pef6v5his-hstab1, followed by blasticidin (calbiochem) selection.
mouse mab ms-1 was used as ms-1 hybridoma supernatant
or purified from the supernatant by hitrap-proteing chromatography (amersham pharmacia biotech). for the generation of
rabbit antiserum against the stabilin-1, a recombinant hstabilin-1
# 2002 biochemical society

was emulsified in freund’s adjuvant and used for intramuscular
immunization in the rabbit carried out essentially as described
in [12]. secondary antibodies used in the present study were
the following : horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
antibody (amersham pharmacia biotech), fitc-conjugated antimouse antibody (dako), cy2 (cyanine cy24 fluorochrome with
emission 505 nm)-conjugated anti-mouse and cy3 (cyanine
cy34 fluorochrome with emission 570 nm)-conjugated antirabbit antibodies (dianova, hamburg, germany).

purification of ms-1 protein peptides from mphi2 and maldi-tof
ms analysis
the ms-1 antigen was isolated with standard immunoprecipitation from 1 litre of culture of primary human mphi2 after
stimulation with il-4 and dexamethasone for 6 days. proteins
were eluted from affinity matrix loaded with anti-mouse igg
antibody and separated by sds\page.
protein bands cut out of the sds\page gel were destained in
methanol\acetic acid\water (45 : 10 : 45, by vol.) overnight with
several changes of the solution and dried with acetonitrile
(gradient grade ; merck). proteins were reduced and alkylated
by washing the gel pieces in water, drying with acetonitrile,
reswelling in 10 mm dithiotreitol\0.1 m nh hco and incu%
$
bation at 56 mc for 30 min. the gel pieces were shrunk again
in acetonitrile, reswollen in 55 mm iodoacetamide\0.1 m
nh hco and incubated at room temperature for an additional
%
$
20 min in the dark. finally, iodoacetamide solution was removed,
and the gel pieces were washed with 0.1 m nh hco for
%
$
15 min and dried with acetonitrile.
for the tryptic digest the gel pieces were reswollen in
50 mm nh hco containing tosylphenylalanylchloromethane
%
$
(‘ tpck ’)-treated bovine pancreatic trypsin (sigma) at a ratio of
approx. 1 : 50 to the calculated amount of protein present in the
gel pieces. the gel pieces were just covered by the solution and
the digest was completed by incubation at 37 mc overnight. after
addition of 10–15 µl of 25 mm nh hco and shaking at 37 mc
%
$
for 15 min, the resulting peptides were first extracted from the gel
by addition of 1–2 gel vol. of acetonitrile and shaking at 37 mc
for 15 min. the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and
the gel pieces extracted further by adding 40–50 µl of 5 % formic
acid (merck), shaking at 37 mc for 15 min and finally shrinking
again with acetonitrile.
all supernatants were pooled and dried in a vacuum concentrator. the final purification of the peptide mixture was
performed with ziptip4 (millipore, eschborn, germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the peptides were
directly eluted with a mixture of 50 % acetonitrile in water
containing the maldi-tof ms matrix and applied to the
maldi-tof ms target using a fast-evaporation nitrocellulose
matrix [14].
chromatograms were recorded with reflex (bruker daltronik, bremen, germany) in reflector mode and continuous
extraction. the post-source decay (psd) spectra were recorded
with the fast method (bruker daltronik) using a fast-pulser.

purification and peptide sequencing of the rat liver ha receptor
purification of the rat liver sinusoidal endothelial-cell ha receptor was performed largely as described by mccourt et al. [12].
typically, ten snap-frozen rat livers were homogenized and the
soluble fraction was purified on a wheatgerm agglutinin–
sepharose column. the eluate was concentrated on an amicon
ym 30 (millipore) membrane and then applied to an s-300
column (amersham pharmacia biotech). after washing, the
proteins were eluted and 10 ml fractions were collected. those

stabilins : fasciclin-like hyaluronan receptor homologues
fractions enriched in proteins of molecular mass greater than
80 kda (by sds\page) were pooled and applied to control–
ethylenediamine–sepharose and ha–ethylenediamine–sepharose
columns in series [15]. bound proteins were eluted with a
pulse of ha oligosaccharides. the eluate from six to eight
purifications was pooled and applied to a lentil lectin–sepharose
column. bound proteins were eluted with  xxxd814xxx  ; the
eluate was concentrated in a centrifugal concentrator and fractionated on a superose 6 column (amersham pharmacia biotech). fractions eluted in the void volume were subjected to
preparative sds\6 %-(w\v)-page under non-reducing conditions. the approx. 270 kda protein band was visualized,
excised and digested ‘ in-gel ’ according to the method of
rosenfeld et al. [16]. the liberated peptides were then purified by
hplc and sequenced.

plasmids and sequencing
hstabilin-1 clone d87433 was identified after the evaluation of
the maldi-tof ms chromatogram with the ms-fit and
pepident programs. the total length of the d87433 clone was
6777 bp. the missing 5h end of hstabilin-1 was determined using
5h-rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) with marathon
ready cdna from spleen (clontech). the complete cdna
sequence of hstabilin-1 was generated by pcr and cloned into
the pef6\v5his-topo-ta vector (invitrogen), resulting in
plasmid pef6\v5his-hstab1 containing the hstabilin-1 gene
driven by the ef-1alpha promoter.
a hstabilin-2 clone dkfzp434e0321, containing 3.9 kb of the
coding sequence, was obtained from the prima$ datenbank am
ressourcenzentrum (rzpd), berlin, germany. the rest of the
coding sequence was obtained by pcr with primers selected
according to the predicted exon–intron structure of the corresponding genomic sequence. pcr products were cloned into a
pcrii-topo vector (invitrogen).
the dkfzp402f1819q2 mstabilin-1 cdna clone, containing
1.8 kb of the coding sequence was obtained from rzpd. the
rest of the cdna was amplified with predicted gene specific
primers. pcr products were cloned into a pcrii-topo vector
(invitrogen) or sequenced directly.
mstabilin-2 cdna was amplified as three overlapping fragments of 2.5, 3.2 and 4.0 kb. fragments were cloned into pcrxl-topo vector (invitrogen) and sequenced.

rna isolation and northern-blot analysis
total rna from cultivated mphi was prepared and used for
northern blots as described in [8]. multiple tissue northern
(mtn4 ; clontech) blots were also used for investigation of
gene expression. membranes were hybridized with $#p-labelled
probes in expresshyb4 solution (clontech).

hstabilin-2 splicing analysis

indirect immunofluorescense

hstabilin-2 splicing was analysed by pcr with the following
primers : st2f037 (5h-agt gga cta tgg acc tag acc
caa c), positions 7002–7026, and st2r037 (5h-agt aag
cag cca agg caa cag c), positions 7627–7607.

the following samples were used for immunofluorescense : mphi
stimulated with il-4 for 6 days, 293-hstabilin-1 cells fixed with
acetone and spleen sections fixed with xylol. all procedures were
performed as described previously by mccourt et al. [12]. primary
antibodies were used as follows : ms-1 mouse hybridoma supernatant, non-diluted ; anti-hstabilin-1 rabbit polyclonal serum
and rabbit preimmune serum (negative control), 1 : 250. the
secondary antibodies were : cy3-anti-mouse 1 : 300 and cy2-antirabbit 1 : 400 (jackson immunoresearch laboratories, west
grove, pa, u.s.a.) ; cy2-anti-mouse 1 : 100 and cy3-anti-rabbit
1 : 400 (dianova). samples were viewed with a leica dm rb
microscope and photographed with a leitz wild mps46\52
camera.

bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis
peptide mass fingerprints obtained by maldi-tof ms analysis
were evaluated using the internet facilities of the proteinprospector (http :\\prospector.ucsf.edu\). the evaluation of the
chromatogram was done with the ms-fit and peptident programs.
public databases were searched for homologueies using
blast programs at the national center for biotechnology
information (ncbi, national library of medicine, bethesda,
md, u.s.a.). the dna sequences were analysed for possible
coding regions using the dnatools program (s. w. rasmussen,
carlsberg research center, valby, copenhagen, denmark). the
deduced protein sequences were analysed for putative functional
domains by comparing with the prosite and pfam databases at

experiments. as ms-1 antigen expression was strongest in mphi2
in itro after stimulation by il-4 and dexamethasone, ms-1
protein was precipitated with mab ms-1 from the latter cells.
the 300 kda protein obtained (figure 1a) was subjected to
maldi-tof ms analysis.
the peptide patterns obtained (figure 1b) were then analysed
using protein-prospector, ms-fit and peptident programs, resulting in several matches with an uncharacterized cdna
kiaa0246 (d87433) (table 1). the identity of the ms-1 protein
and this cdna was demonstrated by generating a peptide
sequence of peak 918 using psd. this cdna was named
hstabilin-1.

cloning of hstabilin-1 and mstabilin-1
a search for hstabilin-1 homology in the ncbi\genbank2 highthroughput genomic sequences (‘ htgs ’) database produced a

and spleen. the extreme 5h-end of the hstabilin-1 mrna was
identified by 5h-race.
the mouse homologue of hstabilin-1 was cloned by searching
mouse expressed-sequence-tag (est) databases with the hstabilin-1 sequence ; 26 est sequences were identified. using these
data, we could amplify and clone 5.5 kb of the 3h-end of
the mstabilin-1 cdna. for the identification of the 5h-end of
mstabilin-1, we screened a mouse genomic library with a 5h probe
for hstabilin-1. sequence analysis of one positive clone enabled
us to derive the putative exon 1 sequence. these sequence data
were used to design primers and amplify the missing 5h part of the
mstabilin-1 cdna. alignment of the sequences of hstabilin-1
and mstabilin-1 showed an identity of 83 and 82 % at the
dna and protein levels respectively (table 2).

12q (ac063946). for the cloning of the full-size cdna the same
strategy as for hstabilin-1 was used. comparison of the fulllength clone with hstabilin-1 gave an identity of 39 % on the
protein level, allowing designation of the protein as hstabilin-2
(table 2).
analysis of the sequences of several hstabilin-2 clones showed
the presence of a 107 bp deletion between nucleotides 7067 and 7173
in some of them. this deletion resulted in a frameshift and in
the appearance of a stop codon at position 7238. the truncated
mrna codes for a hstabilin-2 protein that lacks the c-terminal
fd (see below) and the transmembrane domain, suggesting that
this short form must be secreted. reverse-transcription pcr
analysis showed that both forms of the hstabilin-2 mrna are
present in spleen and liver ; however, the amount of the truncated
form of hstabilin-2 was considerably lower (results not shown).
for the cloning of mstabilin-2, a similar strategy as for cloning
of mstabilin-1 was used. mouse est databases were screened for
homology with the hstabilin-2 sequence. several ests were identified within the est sequences obtained, pcr primers were
selected and the mstabilin-2 sequence was amplified and sequenced, resulting in cdna of about 8 kb. comparison of
mstabilin-2 and hstabilin-2 nucleotide and protein sequences
revealed a 77.2 and 71 % identity respectively (table 2).

domain structure of stabilin proteins
the analysis of the primary and secondary structure of hstabilin1 revealed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 275 kda
deduced from the amino acid sequence. this corresponds to the
previously described mass of the immature protein (280 kda)

before complex glycosylation, as shown by immunoprecipitation
in pulse–chase experiments [1] and to the mass of the recombinant
hstabilin-1 protein (results not shown). hstabilin-2 is predicted to
have a molecular mass of 273 kda, which corresponds well to the
value of 270 kda for the purified natural rat protein.
stabilin-1 and -2 proteins show a mixed content of alpha-helical
and beta-sheet secondary structures according to predator
analysis. scanning the protein sequence using the prosite and
pfam databases showed that stabilin-1 and  xxxg2211xxx  are composed of three blocks with two fds each and a single fd at the
c-terminal end. apart from these domain blocks, there are 15–17
egf-like domains and two to four laminin egf-like domains
distributed between fd blocks and at the n-terminus of the
protein (figure 2). in addition, there is one x-link domain
common to ha-binding proteins. searches for ha binding b(x )-b motifs revealed several motifs in both stabilin-1 and -2
(
[the ha-binding b-(x )-b motif is nine amino acids in length,
(
where b is either arginine or lysine and x contains no acidic
(
residues (such as  xxxd233xxx  or  xxxd2431xxx ) and at least one
# 2002 biochemical society

basic amino acid]. the hydrophobicity analysis of stabilin-1 and
-2 revealed a transmembrane region c-terminal from the last fd
(figure 2). scanning of stabilin-1 for sorting signals using the
psort program also identified features for protein kinase
c\kinase  xxxd1409xxx -dependent sorting into the endosomal compartment, a tyrosine-based motif (ylrar) and the dileucine motif
sllee, suggesting 33.3 % probability of golgi localization,
33.3 % probability of plasma-membrane localization and 33.3 %
probability of endoplasmic-reticulum localization. this implies a
shuttle of the stabilin-1 protein between the plasma membrane
and the endosomal compartment [19].  xxxg2211xxx  analysis did not
reveal any endosomal sorting signals, suggesting preferential
plasma-membrane localization.

expression analysis of stabilins
the expression of hstabilin-1 and -2 mrna was analysed using
northern blots made with total rna from cultivated mphi,
endothelial cells, and diverse cell lines, and using mtn4 blots.

(c) northernblot analysis of mstabilin-1 expression in mouse embryo. lanes 1–4 contain mrna from 7-, 11-, 15- and 17-day embryos respectively.

mtn4 blot analysis revealed hstabilin-1 expression in organs
with prominent endothelial sinuses, such as spleen, liver and
lymph node, and also in placenta, an organ rich in mphi2 (figure
3a). except for human aortic endothelial cells, all other endothelial cells and the liver carcinoma cell line hepg2 were
negative (figure 3b). hstabilin-1 expression was also detected in
mphi2 in itro. on day 3 of cultivation, a transcript of approx.
9 kb was detected in mphi2 stimulated by il-4, dexamethasone or
a combination thereof, as well as in non-stimulated monocytes\
mphi, albeit to a lesser extent (figure 3c, lanes 1 and 3–5). in
contrast, th1-associated cytokine ifngamma suppressed the expression of stabilin-1 to a barely detectable level (figure 3c, lane
2). on day 6 of cultivation, the highest level of hstabilin-1
expression was detected in mphi2 stimulated by il-4 alone (figure

3c, lane 8), while no expression of hstabilin-1 was observed in
ifngamma-stimulated or non-stimulated mphi.
the expression of hstabilin-2 in general paralleled the expression of hstabilin-1, with the strongest signals in foetal and
adult liver, lymph node and spleen (figure 4a). by contrast,
hstabilin-2 expression was neither detected in endothelial cells or
cell lines nor in cultured mphi in northern-blot experiments
(results not shown).
expression of mstabilin-1 in mouse tissues was similar to the
results obtained in human tissues, except for the lack of mstabilin1 in mouse spleen. interestingly, mouse spleen – in contrast to
human spleen – does not contain any endothelial sinuses. thus
comparison of the mrna expression patterns of hstabilin-1 and
mstabilin-1 confirms its association with sinusoidal endothelial

analysis of hstabilin-1 protein localization

4. plant fasciclins

the localization of natural hstabilin-1 protein was analysed in
cultivated mphi2 cells on day 6 of stimulation with il-4 using
indirect immunofluorescense. the ms-1 mouse mab, as well as
the rabbit polyclonal anti-hstabilin-1 antibody, recognized identical patterns of hstabilin-1 distribution (figures 5a and 5b).
stabilin-1 was exclusively localized to cytoplasmatic granular
structures. a similar hstabilin-1 subcellular-distribution pattern
was observed in 293-hstabilin-1 cells (results not shown).
spleen sections were stained by the combination of ms-1 mab
and polyclonal anti-hstabilin-1 antibody. an identical staining
pattern corresponding to spleen sinusoidal endothelium was
detected with both antibodies (figures 5c and 5d). these data
confirm the identity of hstabilin-1 and ms-1 antigen.

a closer analysis of the fd-containing proteins found in higher
animals shows that the osteoblast specific factor-2\betaig-h3 group
and the stabilins define clear-cut protein families.
the x-link-domain-containing proteins are organized into
three subgroups :

phylogenetic analysis

discussion

the fd is used in many different organisms, including bacteria,
plants, and lower and higher animals. a phylogentic analysis of
representative members of this superfamily resulted in a phylogenetic tree that shows formation of four major clusters :

in the present study we have purified and cloned four new highmolecular-mass transmembrane proteins, namely hstabilin-1,
hstabilin-2, mstabilinin-1 and mstabilin-2. hstabilin-1 is identical
with ms-1 antigen, as shown by the use of a polyclonal antiserum
against the recombinant protein and is confirmed here to be
associated with non-continuous endothelial cell and mphi2 differentiation [3,4,21]. hstabilin-1 is selectively expressed by mphi2,

3. proteins sharing a higher homology with  xxxg2297xxx  [20]
a phylogenetic analysis based on a multiple sequence alignment
of representative x-link domains (roughly 90 amino acids) reveals
a clustering of the stabilin proteins within the  xxxg2297xxx  subgroup.

stabilins : fasciclin-like hyaluronan receptor homologues
but not by mphi1 ; hstabilin-1 expression in mphi2 is induced by
th2 cytokines such as il-4 and by anti-inflammatory agents
such as glucocorticoids, and is inhibited by th1 cytokines such
as ifngamma. owing to similarities in biochemistry and tissue
distribution to those of hstabilin-1, rat  xxxg2211xxx  was purified by
ha-affinity chromatography and the human and mouse homologues of this liver sinusoidal endothelial-cell ha receptor were
cloned by using peptide sequences.
both stabilin-1 and  xxxg2211xxx  are multidomain proteins with
seven fds, multiple egf-like domains and a single x-link
domain. among these domains, the x-link domain is the best
functionally characterized domain and is often responsible for
protein binding to ha [22].
ha is a very large polysaccharide present in the extracellular
matrix (ecm), at the cell surface and inside the cell. ha
functions range from ecm formation to intracellular signalling
(reviewed in [23]). there is considerable steady-state turnover of
ha that amounts to approx. 5 g daily. most of it is degraded by
sinusoidal macrophages and endothelial cells in the lymph nodes
[24], organs that strongly express stabilin-1 and  xxxg2211xxx . the
remainder of the ha not disposed of in the lymph nodes enters
the bloodstream. removal of ha from the bloodstream is
crucial for maintaining the blood at an acceptable viscosity, and
this is most efficiently performed by liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells [25].  xxxg2211xxx  may well play this role, as antibodies
generated against the purified natural protein were able to block
ha endocytosis [12]. this is also in accordance with the
bioinformational finding that  xxxg2211xxx  preferentially localizes to
the plasma membrane.
in contrast with  xxxg2211xxx , stabilin-1 did not bind to ha under
the conditions used for ha-affinity chromatography (results not
shown). even when conditions were used as described for ha
binding of the x-link protein  xxxg2297xxx , recombinant hstabilin-1
did not bind. this may be either due to the primary sequence of
stabilin-1, to non-complete processing of the recombinant hstabilin-1 in 293 cells or to discrepancies between in itro conditions
and in io requirements for ha–stabilin-1 complex formation.
with respect to the latter possibility, it has been described that
ha – in addition to steady-state turnover – is also involved in
inflammation and in wound healing. during these processes,
oligomers of depolymerized ha of 4–14 oligosaccharides in
length are generated and induce activation of antigen-presenting
cells, whereas high-molecular-mass ha (1000–200 kda) is ineffective [26]. as far as polarization of antigen-presenting cells is
concerned, ha fragments induce mphi1 and synergize with the
th1 cytokine ifngamma in the process of pro-inflammatory cytokine
induction in mphi1 [27]. in mphi2, however, expression of proinflammatory chemokines is not induced upon ha stimulation.
in conjunction with the selective expression of stabilin-1 in mphi2,
but not in mphi1, the question arises as to whether ha oligomers
may induce anti-inflammatory pathways in these cells [28] and
whether stabilin-1 might mediate this reaction.
similar to the preferentially intracellular receptor of ha
mediated motility ( xxxg1061xxx ) that serves cellular locomotion
along ha fibrils [29], stabilin-1 was not shown to occur on the
plasma membrane, but to preferentially localize to cytoplasmic
granular structures in permeabilized cells transfected with recombinant stabilin-1 as well as in natural mphi2. this is supported
by the bioinformational finding of strong endosomal sorting signals
in stabilin-1. nevertheless, localization to sites of cell contact
has been shown by immunoelectron microscopy for stabilin-1
in splenic sinusoidal endothelial cells [1] ; furthermore,
stabilin-1 is known to occur in mphi2 in close proximity to the
plaque-like fibronexus integrating intracytoplasmic (intermediate
filament) and extracellular (ecm) requirements for spatial

163

stabilization [10]. in order to function as a receptor, stabilin1 – similarly to  xxxg1061xxx  – might shuttle to the plasma membrane under certain, yet undefined, conditions. as has been
described for furin, the shuttle between the endosomal compartment\trans-golgi network and the plasma membrane may
depend on the phosphorylation state of the sorting signals [30].
among the other domains of the stabilins, the fds stand out,
as they are present in proteins involved in adhesion and cell
sorting in several distantly related organisms such as algae
(volox) [31], sea-urchins (paracentrotus liidus [32] and anthocidaris crassispina [33]), the fruitfly (d. melanogaster) [34] and
mammalian species (human [35] and mouse [36]). the prototype
molecule of the fd-containing superfamily is the drosophila
fasciclin i neural-cell adhesion protein, which is implicated in a
variety of functions, such as axon guidance, formation of
embryonic axon commissures and synaptic plasticity [34]. the
functional unit in proteins mediating adhesion was supposed to
be the fd, since the fasciclin i protein is composed almost
entirely by four fds. recently, the mechanism of fd-dependent
adhesion was directly demonstrated for ecm protein betaig-h3.
two out of four fds were involved in interaction with integrin
expressed on human corneal epithelial cells [37]. however, the
relationship between structural diversity, the number of fds and
protein function is unclear, since it ranges from one fd in
mycobacterial mpb70 protein to seven fds in stabilin-1 and
 xxxg2211xxx  and comprises a set of highly conservative motifs
spaced by diverse non-conservative fragments [31,38].
in addition to seven fds with a putative cell-adhesion function,
both stabilins contain multiple egf-like domains also supposed
to mediate cellular adhesion properties [39]. the presence of
multiple different domain modules responsible for cell adhesion
and interaction with ecm is indicative of concomitant or
sequential interactions with multiple partners leading to the
integration of extracellular events with intracellular signal transduction. these features are well known from other cell adhesion
and attachment proteins, including the immunoglobulin and
cadherin superfamilies. owing to their unique common domain
structure, the high level of protein sequence similarity and the
phylogenetic relationship, the stabilins constitute a novel protein
family. the molecular mechanisms of stabilin function and their
physiological role in vascular function and angiogenesis as well
as in antigen presentation and immune reactions remain to be
elucidated.
