human type i interferons (ifn) require two receptor
chains,  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c for high affinity (pm)
binding and biological activity. our previous studies
have shown that the ligand dependent assembly of the
type i ifn receptor chains is not identical for all type
i ifns.  xxxg1140xxx  appears unique in its ability to assemble
a stable complex of receptor chains, as demonstrated
by the observation that ifnar2c co-immunoprecipitates with  xxxg1138xxx  when cells are stimulated
with  xxxg1140xxx  but not with ifna. the characteristics of
such a receptor complex are not well defined nor is it
understood if differential signaling events can be mediated by variations in receptor assembly. to further
characterize the factors required for formation of
such a stable receptor complex we demonstrate using
ifn stimulated daudi cells that (1) ifnar2c coimmunoprecipitates with  xxxg1138xxx  even when tyrosine
phosphorylation of receptor chains is blocked with
 xxxd3241xxx , and (2) ifnb1b but not ifna2, is
present in the immunoprecipitated receptor complex.
these results demonstrate that the unique  xxxg1140xxx  induced assembly of type i ifn receptor chains is independent of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the
recruitment of additional proteins to the receptor by
such events. furthermore, the presence of ifnb1b in
the immunoprecipitated ifn receptor complex suggests that  xxxg1140xxx  interacts and binds differently to the
receptor than ifna2. these results suggest that the
specific assembly of type i ifn receptor chains is ligand dependent and may represent an early event
which leads to the differential biological responses
observed among type i ifns. © 1999 academic press

human type i ifns mediate immune responses, antiviral activity and have antiproliferative actions (1).
these effects are initiated by the binding of type i ifn
to a specific receptor on the cell surface. the type i ifn
receptor is comprised of two chains,  xxxg1138xxx  and
ifnar2c (2,3). ligand-dependent association of  xxxg1138xxx 
and ifnar2c results in the formation of a high affinity
binding site for ifns (4,5,6). upon formation of the
receptor complex, the close juxtaposition of the intracellular domains of the receptor chains is thought to
lead to the activation of the janus kinases,  xxxg1219xxx  and
 xxxg2364xxx  (7). activated  xxxg1219xxx  and  xxxg2364xxx  are thought
to phosphorylate tyrosine residues present within
 xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c as well as other proteins such
as stat1 and  xxxg2214xxx  (8). stat1 and  xxxg2214xxx  bind to
the receptor chains and become part of the type i ifn
receptor complex in a sequential manner (9). stat1
activated in this way has been proposed to become
associated directly (10) or indirectly (9) with both
ifnar2c and  xxxg1138xxx . while not demonstrated, it
is presumed that tyrosine phosphorylation of each
 xxxg1138xxx  chain may play a role in the final assembly of a
functional type i ifn receptor. recently, we reported
that not all type i ifns interact with the receptor in a
similar fashion (11). immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis, using  xxxg1138xxx -specific antibodies, demonstrated that upon binding of ifnb1b to its receptor a
highly stable receptor complex was formed. this was
not the case when ifna2 or ifna8 was used, suggesting that there were differences in the stability of the
receptor complex formed by ifna or ifnb1b (11). we
postulated that differences in tyrosine phosphorylation
patterns may account for differences in the strength
and or duration of ligand association with the  xxxg1138xxx 
chains or in the activation of ifna or  xxxg1140xxx -specific
signal transduction pathways.
in this report we examined the interaction of ifna2
and ifnb1b with the type i ifn receptor and the role

that ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation plays in
such an interaction. our results indicate that binding
of ifnb1b (but not ifna) to the type i ifn receptor
induces the formation of a stable trimolecular complex
consisting of ifnb1b,  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c in a process that is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation.
these results indicate that the uniquely different degree of ifns association with  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c in
the receptor complex is mediated by interactions between the different ifns and the receptor chains and
does not require receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or
the recruitment of additional proteins involved in secondary signaling events. these differences in ligandreceptor interactions may be responsible for some of
the different biological effects of various type i ifns
(12-18).
materials and methods
cells and reagents. daudi cells were obtained from american
type tissue culture (atcc) and grown in rpmi 1640 media (life
technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum and
5% penicillin/streptomycin (life tech). human ifnb1b (specific activity 2.5 x 10 7 u/mg) was produced as described previously (19), and
ifna2 (specific activity 3.0 x 10 8 u/mg) was purchased from pepro
tech inc. anti- xxxd1075xxx  antibody ab-2 was purchased from
oncogene sciences, and all secondary antibodies were purchased
from santa cruz biotechnology. nonidet p-40 and  xxxd3241xxx 
were purchased from cal biochem. the protease inhibitors leupeptin
and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) were purchased from
boehringer mannheim. all other buffers and reagents were purchased from sigma chemicals.
production of antibodies directed against  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2.
anti- xxxg1138xxx  monoclonal antibody 4b1 was generated to a baculovirus expressed ectodomain of  xxxg1138xxx  (20) and anti-ifnar2c polyclonal sera was generated in rabbits immunized with a purified 6x
his tagged ectodomain of ifnar2 (11).
immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting. daudi cells (1 x 10 8/
ml) were stimulated with ifna2 or ifnb1b (800 ng/10 8 cells) for 15
minutes at 37°c unless otherwise stated. in some instances, cells
were incubated with the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx 
(final concentration 10 nm) for 5 minutes at 37°c prior to ifn
stimulation. after stimulation, cells were centrifuged and lysed in
1.5 ml anti-phosphatase lysis buffer (20 mm tris ph 7.2, 0.5%
np-40, 150 mm nacl, 10% glycerol (v/v) containing 1.0 mm sodium
orthovanadate, 1.0 mm sodium fluoride, 1.0 mm pmsf, 5.0 mg/ml
leupeptin and 5.0 mg/ml  xxxd207xxx ). detergent lysates were
centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4°c, and the supernatant
was incubated overnight at 4°c with 2.0 mg anti- xxxg1138xxx  monoclonal
antibody (4b1) conjugated to cnbr sepharose 4b (pharmacia). immunoprecipitates were isolated by low speed centrifugation and were
washed in lysis buffer. final, washed immunoprecipitations were
solubilized in 0.2 m tris ph 8.0 containing 8.0% sds and 20%
glycerol, and boiled 2 minutes before sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) (8% tris/glycine,
novex). electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride (pvdf) and blocked overnight at room temperature with
20 mm tris ph 7.5 containing, 150 mm nacl and 0.1% tween-20.
immunoblots, blocked overnight in blocking buffer, were incubated
for 2 hours with a 1:1000 dilution of either the anti- xxxd1075xxx 
ab-2, a rabbit polyclonal sera to ifnar2, or a monoclonal antibody
to  xxxg1138xxx  (40h2, 2 mg/10ml diltuion buffer). the immunoblots were
washed in blocking buffer and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution
of the secondary hrp conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit antibody

(santa cruz biotechnology) for 1 hour before a final wash. blots were
developed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (pierce).
luciferase assay. human t98g cells were stably transfected
with a luciferase reporter gene fused to an isre-15 minimal promoter. cells containing the construct in a stable form are referred to
as tj1-16 cells (21). immunoprecipitated samples, to be analyzed
using this reporter assay, were prepared identically to those used for
immunoblots with the following exceptions. control immunoprecipitations were performed with an equal amount of anti-mouse igg
antibody conjugated to agarose (sigma) using detergent lysates derived from daudi cells that had been stimulated with either ifna2
or ifnb1b. immunoprecipitations were washed 3 times in lysis
buffer and washed once with water (ph 7.2) to remove detergent. the
immunoprecipitated complex was then incubated in an acidic buffer
of 0.1 m glycine ph 3.0 (60 ml per immunoprecipitation) for 10
minutes at 25°c in order to release receptor complex-bound ifn.
samples were removed from the pelleted material and neutralized
with 1n naoh (3 ml) and immediately titered on tj1-16 luciferase
cells growing in 96 well plates. tj1-16 cells were incubated with
samples for 4 hours at 37°c, media was removed, and cells were
lysed and luminescence measured using a luciferase assay kit
(promega). plates were read on a microlumat (eg&g berthold)
luminometer.

results
initially, we performed experiments to determine if
the protein kinase inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx  was able to
prevent the phosphorylation of the  xxxg1138xxx  chains.
daudi cells were incubated with either ifna2 or
ifnb1b, in the presence or absence of  xxxd3241xxx ,
for 10 min at 37°c. after incubation, cells were lysed
and lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation using
anti- xxxg1138xxx  antibody as described in materials and
methods. immunoblots of anti- xxxg1138xxx  immunoprecipitates were probed with anti- xxxd1075xxx  antibodies (fig. 1). a 137 kda phosphoprotein was apparent only when cells were stimulated with either ifna2
or ifnb1b (fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). we have previously
shown that the 137 kda phosphoprotein represents
phosphorylated  xxxg1138xxx  (11,22). stimulation of the
cells with ifnb1b resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of an additional 110 kda phosphoprotein which
represents ifnar2c (11,23) (fig. 1, lane 3). ifninduced phoshorylation of either  xxxg1138xxx  or ifnar2c
was prevented by preincubation of the cells with  xxxd3241xxx  (fig. 1, lanes 4 & 5). probing of the immunoblots with antibodies recognizing  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c
demonstrated the presence of these receptor chains even
in the absence of phosphorylation (fig. 2).  xxxg1138xxx  was
present in unstimulated and ifn stimulated daudi cell
lysates (fig. 2, lanes 1-5) while ifnar2c was coimmunoprecipitated with  xxxg1138xxx  only from detergent
lysates derived from ifnb1b stimulated daudi cells
(fig. 2, lane 3 & 5). thus  xxxd3241xxx , while preventing protein phosphorylation, had no effect on the coimmunoprecipitation of  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c from
ifnb1b stimulated daudi cell lysates.
although  xxxg1140xxx  stimulation of daudi cells appears to
be required for the co-immunoprecipitation of a stable

were prepared from either unstimulated daudi cells (lane 1), daudi
cells stimulated with ifna2 (lane 2) or daudi cells stimulated with
ifnb1b (lane 3) and subjected to sds-page. after electrophoresis
proteins were transfered to a pdvf membrane and probed with an
anti- xxxd1075xxx  antibody (ab2). a phosphoprotein signal is
non-detectable in unstimulated daudi cells (lane 1). stimulation
with either ifna or ifnb1b induces the appearance of an 137 kda
phosphoprotein (corresponding to  xxxg1138xxx ) (lanes 2 & 3). a 110 kda
phosphoprotein (corresponding to ifnar2c) is apparent only in
ifnb1b stimulated cells (lane 3). neither  xxxg1138xxx  nor ifnar2c are
phosphorylated when cells are incubated for 5 minutes with 10 nm
 xxxd3241xxx  followed by exposure to either ifna or ifnb1b (lanes
4 & 5). molecular weight standards (kda) are indicated at left.

 xxxg1138xxx /ifnar2c receptor complex it has not been
shown that  xxxg1140xxx  remains present in the immunoprecipitated receptor complex. because the immunoprecipitation procedure is performed in buffer lacking ifn
and incubation of receptor and antibody occurs over 12
hours, it appeared likely that  xxxg1140xxx  would have dissociated from the receptor complex during this time. if
dissociation of  xxxg1140xxx  from the receptor complex did
occur then the  xxxg1138xxx /ifnar2 complex would need
to be held together largely by interactions between the
receptor chains themselves. in order to determine if
ifn’s remained bound to the immunoprecipitated receptor we took advantage of the acid stability of ifn’s
and a cell based reporter assay dependent upon an
interferon sensitive promoter (isre-15) driving a luciferase reporter gene (tj1-16 cells) (21). immunoprecipitates were prepared identically to those used for
immunoblots except that the immunoprecipitated receptor was eluted from the final water-washed antiifnar1 affinity-resin in 0.1 m glycine ph 3.0. acid
eluted material was neutralized to ph 7.2 and immediately titered on tj1-16 reporter cells. after four
hours incubation at 37°c ifn-dependent luciferase activity was measured. immunoprecipitated samples
were compared with standards of ifna2 and ifnb1b
for induction of luciferase. control immunoprecipita-

tions were performed under identical conditions, as
described in materials and methods. incubation of
tj1-16 cells with control antibody (anti-mouse igg)
over a wide dilution range failed to induce luciferase
activity (fig. 3a, open triangles, crosses). it should be
noted that daudi cells were stimulated with either
ifna2 or ifnb1b prior to immunoprecipitation with
anti-mouse igg as a negative control thus ruling out
any non-specific carry over of ifn. similarly, antiifnar1 immunoprecipitates derived from daudi cells
stimulated with ifna2 failed to induce the luciferase
reporter (fig. 3a, open squares) at all dilutions tested.
in contrast, a dilution-dependent luciferase signal was
observed when anti- xxxg1138xxx  immunoprecipitates from
daudi cells stimulated with ifnb1b were evaluated
(fig. 3a, closed circles). in the same set of experiments,
we compared the ability of purified ifna2 and ifnb1b
to induce the luciferase reporter when added to tj1-16
cells (fig. 3b). when analyzed, ifna2 and ifnb1b
were able to induce the reporter in a similar manner
(ifna2 ed 50 5 3.0 pm, ifnb1b ed 50 5 1.4 pm) when
evaluated on a mass basis, so if present in the immunoprecipitate, ifna2 would have been detected.
discussion
results from experiments presented here indicate
that ifnb1b and ifna2 interact with the type i ifn
receptor in distinct fashions. ifnb1b appears to form a

immunoprecipitates described in fig. 1 were run on sds-page,
blotted onto a pdvf membrane and probed with both, anti- xxxg1138xxx

a 137 kda protein in all lanes, and ifnar2c (110 kda) is apparent
only in immunoprecipitates from ifnb1b stimulated cells (lanes 3 &
5), whether or not cells were pre-treated with 10 nm  xxxd3241xxx 
(lanes 4 & 5). molecular weight standards (kda) are indicated at left.

previously (21) and acid-eluted supernatants from immunoprecipitates were added at various dilutions. after 4 h incubation at 37°c, cells
were lysed and luciferase activity determined. ifn activity was detected in anti- xxxg1138xxx  immunoprecipitates from daudi cells stimulated
with ifnb1b (closed circles) but no activity was detected from cells stimulated with equal amounts of ifna2 (open squares). no ifn activity
was detected in control immunoprecipitates, using an anti-mouse igg conjugated resin (sigma), obtained from daudi cells stimulated with
either ifna2 (open triangles) or ifnb1b (x--x). b) on a mass basis, ifnb1b (filled circles) and ifna2 (open circles) had identical activities
in the tj1-16 ifn assay. all data is presented in relative light units (rlu) and ordinates are based on known mass of ifn added to cells

experiments (s. e. 5 15%, n 5 3).

strong complex with  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c (fig. 3)
independent of secondary phosphorylation events,
whereas ifna2 does not (fig. 1, lane 3). these results
and others (11) indicate a clear difference between
ifna2/ifna8 and ifnb1b and their receptor binding
properities.  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c cooperate to form a
high affinity receptor for both ifna and  xxxg1140xxx  (4-6,24),
and crosslinking studies on whole cells show that type
i ifns interact with both receptor chains (25, our unpublished data). it is unclear whether or not  xxxg1140xxx  has
exactly the same affinity for its receptor as ifna (2628). previously, we demonstrated that, in murine cells
expressing human  xxxg1138xxx  chains, ifnb1b is 10-fold
better at displacing ifna8 bound to its receptor than
ifna8 itself suggesting that in the case of ifna8 and
ifnb1b, different receptor binding characteristics exist (4). although ifna and  xxxg1140xxx  use identical receptor
chains our previous results suggested that  xxxg1140xxx  interacts with and assembles the type i ifn receptor chains
in a different manner than ifna2 or ifna8 (11). results presented here further strengthen this conclusion
and extend this observation to demonstrate that receptor tyrosine phsophorylation and the subsequent recruitment of additional proteins to the receptor due to
such events does not play a role in the observed differences in ifn-receptor interactions.  xxxg1138xxx , ifnar2c
and ifnb1b form a stable receptor complex as demon-

strated by our ability to co-immunoprecipitate all of
these proteins as a tightly bound complex (fig. 3). it is
likely that  xxxg1140xxx  induces the receptor chains to assemble and interact with each other in a different manner
than ifna2 and that both ligand binding and direct
interactions between the receptor chains themselves
play a role in receptor stability. this proposition has
been recently supported by the observation that selective amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of ifnar2c can eliminate a measurable cellular
response to ifna2 or ifna8 while not effecting  xxxg1140xxx 
activity (29). this data supports the premise that  xxxg1140xxx 
utilizes different amino acid contact points within
ifnar2c to bind to the receptor than do either ifna2
or ifna8. a role for  xxxg1138xxx  in the mediation of differential ifn signaling has also been suggested by
recent studies using site-specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain of  xxxg1138xxx 
(30). these monoclonal antibodies blocked both ifndependent antiviral activities and formation of an
isgf3 transcription complex. however, inhibition of
these activities only occurred in ifna and not  xxxg1140xxx 
stimulated cells.
while a stable trimolecular receptor/ligand complex
has also been demonstrated for  xxxg1141xxx  and its receptor
(31), it is unusual that ifna and  xxxg1140xxx  interact with
the same receptor chains but  xxxg1140xxx  assembles an ob-

fig. 4. proposed model for the assembly of type i ifn receptor
chains. ifna2 and ifnb1b interact with the extracellular domains
of  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c in distinct fashion. such distinct interaction results in different tertiary structures within the intracellular
portions of the receptor chains leading to ifn-specific signaling. the
molecules involved in mediating specificity of ifn signaling have not
yet been identified.

servably more stable trimolecular complex. for other
cytokines that have common receptor subunits, specificity of signaling is usually achieved by the presence of
additional receptor components that are cytokinespecific (32,33). a ifna- or  xxxg1140xxx -specific receptor
chain does not appear to exist for type i ifns suggesting that specificity of signaling within the ifn family
of proteins may be explained by differential usage of
identical receptor chains.
we propose a model (fig. 4) that accepts that ifna
and  xxxg1140xxx  may have similar receptor affinities (4,11),
but assumes ifna and  xxxg1140xxx  bind to  xxxg1138xxx  and
ifnar2c in a distinctly different fashion resulting in
different receptor structures. this results in a receptor
complex in which the efficiency of signaling through
the receptor is dependent on receptor orientation. such
a model is similar to that derived from detailed
structure-functions studies for the erythropoietin re-

ceptor where it was demonstrated that the binding of
erythropoietin imposes a unique orientation of the receptor chains that is responsible for optimal signaling
(34). our model predicts that formation of an  xxxg1138xxx ,
ifnar2c and  xxxg1140xxx  trimolecular receptor complex
would be different than that formed with ifna and
that such receptor complexes would have a functional
consequence related to subsequent signaling events. if
 xxxg1140xxx  is able to preferentially activate genes that ifna
cannot, and both ifns use the same receptor, then one
way  xxxg1140xxx  can distinguish itself from ifna is by the
manner in which it engages and assembles the ifn
receptor. differences in receptor assembly may also
exist within the ifna family of proteins which give rise
to the observed variations in biological activities
among ifna’s themselves (12,13,15).
the manner in which cytokines interact with the
extracellular domain of cytokine receptors may influence signaling events occurring within the cytoplasmic
domain of each receptor chain (fig. 4). such an observation is supported by recent results taken from studies of intracellular/extracellular chimeras of the  xxxg718xxx  (epor) and the  xxxg1142xxx  receptor
chain (35). when the extracellular domain of epor is
fused to the intracellular domain of  xxxg1142xxx  a partial
signal is generated whereas  xxxg1142xxx  alone cannot signal. hence the manner in which the extracellular domains dimerize with ligand determines whether or not
the intracellular domain is capable of generating a
signaling event. an  xxxg1140xxx  specific signaling domain
within the cytoplasmic regions of  xxxg1138xxx  chains has
recently been demonstrated for ifnar2c (36). in this
case, deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of ifnar2c
had little effect on ligand binding but had profound
effects on the ability of  xxxg1140xxx , but not ifna2, to generate an antiviral response in murine cells. these results suggest that specific regions within the cytoplasmic domain of ifnar2c be induced by the binding of
 xxxg1140xxx  at the cell surface to elicit and mediate  xxxg1140xxx 
specific responses. it remains to be determined how
such responses occur, but they are likely to require
additional signaling proteins as has been proposed to
explain the preferential induction by  xxxg1140xxx  of the a
chemokine br1 (37).
in summary, while the formation of a stable receptor
complex may initiate unique signaling events, formation of the receptor complex itself does not appear to be
dependent on such signals. this implies that  xxxg1140xxx 
assembles  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2c in a unique manner
and that any specific signaling events generated from
such a receptor complex are initiated early on by its
tertiary structure as a function of interactions between
ligand and receptor chains. the exact process by which
such ifn specific signaling events occur and which
signaling proteins mediate such responses remains to
be determined. ligand specific differences in the architecture of the ifn-receptor complex itself may help

begin to explain how differential gene transcription
between ifna and  xxxg1140xxx  is possible using identical
receptor chains.
